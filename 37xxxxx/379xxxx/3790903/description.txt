Overview:	This is one incredible movie. Betty Ting Pei, the woman in whose apartment Bruce Lee died, stars as herself in the story of her relationship with the international action icon. Danny Lee - who was to find even greater fame in such classics as John Woo's "The Killer", Liu Chia-liang's "Tiger On The Beat 2", and his self-directed true crime thrillers "Dr. Lamb" - wisely chooses not to try an impersonation of Bruce. Instead he just holds on tight as the fascinating expose unfolds. The international title, "Bruce Lee: His Last Days, His Last Nights", might give you an idea of the action in store, as Betty "strips away" the rumors to reveal her version of the truth...among other things. John Lo Mar, who loved making wall-to-wall, streamlined, kung-fu-crammed action films, works with esteemed martial arts instructors Tang Chia and Yuen Woo-ping to make the fight action as interesting as the rest.
