,brunty,2007-09-02T22:39Z,how do you play this file im on xp what do i need
,death734,2007-09-03T04:04Z,"the pirate bay downloaded count is never accurate

to play get coreavc and media player classic (also ac3filter if you don't have that)

btw on avg these are 42-43min and 4000kbps bitrate."
,Hei_p책-deg,2007-09-04T13:22Z,"brunty :
www.videolan.org  - VLC Media Player.

Most people would recommend this."
,mixderax,2007-09-05T09:43Z,Because .divx can't hold h264 video.
,diamondbanger,2007-09-06T19:24Z,"hello, is this a dvd or must you have a divx compatible dvd player??"
,diamondbanger,2007-09-06T19:24Z,"hello, is this a dvd or must you have a divx compatible dvd player??"
,diamondbanger,2007-09-06T19:26Z,Is there swedish subtitle as well?
,death734,2007-09-07T01:35Z,"thecash907
EVERYONE doing 720p/1080p encodes uses x264 in .mkv because mkv is the best container all around and x264 is indeed superior quality then xvid or divx (xvid>divx).
honestly, who uses .divx extension? its just avi renamed to.

your divx player will NOT play these files they are 720p x264. even 720p xvid doesn't work on stand alones most of the time. play in media player classic with coreavc and ac3filter installed"
,Rangrang,2007-09-10T09:07Z,"Dennis_Olof: You can select which parts to download in your torrent program. If you cannot do that get a better program. F.e. I you just want to check quality or test if you can play it, put all files on ""do not download"" then put a sample on high or normal priority. Putting everything in one big file makes it easier to download everything and more people are sharing it.

Quality was excellent. And the Heroes series is great, best I've watched in a long time. Thanks for the upload."
,Rangrang,2007-09-10T09:08Z,"I meant ""one big share"" not one big file, because its not one file."
,Klinth,2007-09-15T23:51Z,"Hi mixderax and all dlers.
first id like to thank u for a awesome upload because the quality is perfect but i dont like the chinese subs ;) and i have seeded so have the ratio 5.5 now (uploaded 205gb) as a thanks and i will continue with that. 

BUT when i dubble clicked the file windows media player couldnt play it, so the pc asked me if i wanted to use the internet to find the codec or another program to open it. i chose the internet because its better and then i did.
windows dindt know so it send me to msn search and i clicked on the most popular website and it was called CCCP (combined community codec pack) and i wonder if u, much better guys, know or have heard of anything about it because my ""anti virus nose"" tells me it smells like a virus.
so please can someone check it out for me plz, or just tell me if u know anything about it. i will be very thankfull because my last pc fucked-up due virus and i have a new one and i want it to be fine for a few years more :). "
,mixderax,2007-09-16T20:24Z,"If You get cccp from here: http://cccp-project.net/
it's OK"
,mixderax,2007-09-16T20:25Z,"Also those chines subs are optimal, they are just separate files"
,Xerox-Reborn,2007-10-04T09:31Z,"I have downloaded ac4filter, coreavc, divx, xvid, media classic, and two diff splitters. I opened the mkv files, but whenever I play them using media classic, I get audio but no sound! Can anyone help?"
,olloroin,2007-10-08T20:19Z,"Use VLC mediaplayer. It is the easiest way to play MKV. it also is able tho play dvd-R directly from the iso file. just right click, and open in VLC"
,Horus Scorpion,2007-10-15T17:18Z,Am I the only one with problems when burning the episodes to dvd using ConvertXtoDVD? I don't get any sound :S it works perfectly fine on the pc

,Modrak,2008-01-06T00:05Z,"thecash907: Scene rules for 2007 about tv shows mention mkv as the ONLY container that can be used for releases of 720p shows...

if your player doesn't do this, well, your problem, get a new one :)"
,Bananahammockz,2008-03-05T17:17Z,"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, YOU MUST PLEASE S3333D! I'm going to have grown a beard before this finishes, so I desperately need YOUR kilobytes. 

Anyways, awsumness. My thanks to you, mixderax."
,mplante21,2008-03-14T22:19Z,for anyone who wants to know how to play hddvd or bluray all you need is the k-lite mega codec pack and a relatively fast computer with some ram.  Thats all I have and i never have a problem.  You can play the shows with media classic as long as you have that pack
,ApocalypseBob,2008-04-27T14:33Z,"Decently synced english subs here:

Volume One of their epic tale begins here...
""GENESIS""

At 00:59 it says:
Chapter one
""In his own image""



E01
mind-heroes.s01e01.720p.hddvd.x264.mkv

At 00:19 at the end of the text that scrolls over the screen it says:
Volume One of their epic tale begins here...

At 00:59 it says:
Chapter one
""Genesis""




Is there a way to remove the subtitles?"
,Skyfallaks,2008-12-24T11:50Z,"Holy mother of god 36 gigs and seeder-leecher ratio 1:22.

And people, as a warning, this torrent contains 23 ""samples"" each the size of 50 megs, and together they form over one gig, so removing those should lessen the burden a little."
,tango4717,2009-07-09T13:18Z,"@ZafiQ and anyone else who wonders about episode 00.

It's just an extended cut of pilot.  Not really needed as most of the extra stuff is explained in other episodes, but it's nice to have."

,KickassWashingMachine,2011-02-16T05:31Z,"Thanks for this :)

Never seen this before, I wish though that I hadn't seen the ""pilot"" episode (00) as some of the stuff it contains is rewritten in the real episodes. Can be a tad confusing and gives away story twists too early, and it doesn't appear that much of the added runtime is actually extra footage, as much of it is reused later in the next episodes.

I would advise any one to not watch the 00 episode until maybe after finishing the whole deal."
