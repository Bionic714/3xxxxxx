,R.Cafe,2008-04-29T13:10Z,"Hey Thanks alot mictrmbl! 

I loved the movie, it was great. I liked how it dealt with many important issues such as showing Media biasy and lies, racism and standing up for what you believe to be right, among many other issues. 

The soundtrack is fab; the lyrics especially!
