Recorded during a 1976 U.K. tour, WE'VE GOT A LIVE ONE HERE! shows that you don't have to be from the U.S. to appreciate the many forms of American roots music that are part of the Commander's sound. The enthusiastic English crowd eats up the group's unique blend of boogie-woogie, rockabilly, Western swing, and honky-tonk. By this time, the group had been together long enough to hone their arrangements to a fine point, but were still enjoying the last wave of their initial flush of success. Consequently, Cody and company are at their tightest here, but still full of energy and enthusiasm. Clocking in with 19 tracks, this is the longest of the band's many live albums, giving listeners a chance to experience the full breadth of the Commander's varied sound. 256kbs mp3.
