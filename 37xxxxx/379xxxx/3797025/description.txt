Piknik is an enormously popular Russian rock group, which only recently came to the attention of many Westerners through its many mentions in Sergei Lukyanenko\'s best-selling Night Watch series.

Although most Western audiences will be unable to appreciate the mythologically themed lyrics, the tonal melodies and
pulsating rhythms bespeak a cynically melancholic emotional chord sure to resonate in any culture\'s subconscious.
