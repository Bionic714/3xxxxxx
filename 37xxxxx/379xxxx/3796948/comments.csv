,sajberman,2007-09-10T21:04Z,"Thanx great release but im missing the swedish keyboard layout you removed, how do i install this?
I have another XP cd if i need to pick some files from the install cd."
,sickofsaint,2007-09-12T04:32Z,"ADVICE PLEASE:   I began with a clean hard drive, but keep getting this ""missing ntdlr"" error.  What am I doing wrong?  CPU is booting from CDROM.  The torrent downloaded fine and I burned it as an ISO with Nero 7."
,thafeez,2007-09-14T05:48Z,not bootable.  looks for existing OS.
,cscmrwizard,2007-09-20T03:58Z,swedish keyboard layout you removed i not the one that did the release i just had it on disk and is the one i use    you mite try nlite to add and edit it
,gradea091788,2007-09-29T16:06Z,"***NOTE***
EVERYONE IF YOU GET AN ERROR SAYING 'THE INSTALLATION CANT BE COMPLETED BECAUSE IT CANT FIND THE netupgrd.dll FILE....JUST COPY AND PASTE THE i386 FOLDER ONTO YOUR HARDDRIVE, AND RE-RUN INSTALL....
***ENJOY***"
,KillAWatt_1705,2007-09-30T14:03Z,"Sorry to say that its not even bootable. I converted into an ISO image file, burned it, and repeated this process numerous times, though when booting from the disc it just looks loads up my default operating system. "
,some_j,2007-09-30T17:13Z,"it's already an image, just burn with nero and it should work, just burn tested it runs neat
thx to the uploader for the perfect copy"
,some_j,2007-10-03T14:04Z,"I have a problem,
does anybody know how to add the dutch keyboard layout, because i cannot find it anywhere on the web, i found one on the microschoft support site, but a dead end so,
i could really have some help please?
thx in advance"
,KillAWatt_1705,2007-10-03T15:43Z,"To some_j:

Its a folder with "".ISO"" at the end. Though its not  a actual ISO file format. 

The furthest I've gone so far is: ""Setup is inspecting your computers hardware configuration."" Then it reboots and boots up regularly. "
,some_j,2007-10-03T17:29Z,"Because it doesn't have an .iso extention, it doesn't mean it's not an image,
you don't need to extract or convert this,
it's ready to burn,
that's simple, and you say that it reboots constantly,
maybe try another burner, i use nero!"
,KillAWatt_1705,2007-10-04T15:42Z,"I didn't mention the fact that it has to be an ISO image file. I just saying that its a folder, a regular folder with it named as being "".ISO"" at the end. Its not any other image file.

I've burned with Nero, and PowerISO numerous times. Nero is my first choice in burning anything, I only downloaded and installed and PowerISO when the disk wasn't booting, so I tryed another burner."
,some_j,2007-10-04T19:59Z,"i just mounted it with deamon toolsen burned the files that where on the virtual deamon disk on a cd and it works to, so it's just strange that it doesn't work for you i even tried a dvd-rw for this, in my opinion this is very bootable"
,KillAWatt_1705,2007-10-05T17:27Z,"Indeed very strange. I really can't be bothered to download another 600MB+ file for a windows installation, it takes way to long on my connection speed. 

Sorry to ask from you so much some_j, but can  you please give me detailed, step-by-step instructions on how you burned the disk with Nero?

This'll be my last attempt. If your instructions don't result in a successful bootable disk, then I'll give up. I'll declare that my download was a faulty one, a separate case altogether. Seeing as it worked for everyone else who downloaded this. 

I really appreciate your help and assistance some_j,

KillAWatt1705 "
,some_j,2007-10-05T19:32Z,"ok
i opened nero burning rom,
then in the center a screen pop-ups (choose compilation) click cancel.
on the top click recorder en choose burn image.
browse for the file (do not alter the file, just in the first state like you downloaded it)and click open.
a screen pops-up in the middle to ask you to burn the image, and just click burn.
and that's it, after the burning it should be bootable.
Hope it works, let me know
greetz"
,JoystickMan,2007-11-10T10:24Z,"When i try to install it say something like: ''You need a update.. and the update is Rollup 2. And when i try to install the update it say: You need Windows Media Center 2005 to install this update''
What i gonna do?"

,raganriley,2008-01-28T03:07Z,I get Fatal Error on Setup. Does not work.
,acutturi,2008-02-17T18:30Z,"Installed no hassle.  Easy to navigate and run.  I had to install LAN, audio and some other drivers, but that was easy.  MCE found my network and I can watch Divx movies through the network files, which is all I wanted.  This would make a great OS for a cheap HTPC.

Thanks!"
,BIGstef,2008-03-01T01:23Z,THIS IS BRILLIANT!!! Thanks
,catsartcox,2008-03-04T17:59Z,"hey guys  i think i fixed the ""can't boot"" problem   whetre it just skips it and just lodes the os

idk  why i does but thats just someinfo for u"
,ghee_mcfree,2008-03-08T22:38Z,"Thanks for the upload.  Everything worked fine, but with one hitch.  After setup, xp says it needs to be activated or it will not function after 60 days.  The key that comes preprogrammed doesn't work (a msg. says that it has already been used the maximum number of times possible) and asks for another key.  Any ideas?  Thanks."
,Hummmps,2008-03-11T06:01Z,So....Does this shit work anymore?
,donfrenchiano,2008-03-16T16:06Z,Does anyone know if this will pass as a genuine copy with WGA?
,TheStorm01,2008-03-22T11:00Z,This does work. Excellent for low dollar HTPC. Of course you need your specific drivers for your computer hardware and of course...compatible hardware (PCI audio from your tv card) and of course time (which the wife wont give!). I had a problem to insert the key for this...i think there was an extra character at the end that should not be there (you must change it later anyway). Installed the rollup without problems. The only other problem is that this OS was really trimmed down...it won't support any other keyboard input languages other than English variants. Anyone know how to add a keyboard language (italian)?
,hyperkine,2008-04-28T22:36Z,"Sorry to say it didn't work for me.  Errored out when it couldn't find a file called ""asms""."
,hyperkine,2008-05-02T05:43Z,I retract my last comment--I used a different CD burning application and after doing so the install completed normally.  The only extra thing I had to do was to crack WPA/activation.
,BitterCandy,2008-05-07T21:42Z,"This is the 5th variant of XP MCE 2005 I've downloaded that claimed to be valid and complete, and yes, the 5th time I've reinstalled on my media centre. Finally one version that is exactly what it says it is, and behaves as it should. Thank you thank you thank you! For those with serial number woes, 

I didn't change the serial as directed, and it validated and let me do all the updates."
,shizilao,2008-05-09T13:13Z,"Just awesome!!! Follow the instructions in readme.txt and you will get the true genuine version. After the rather time-consuming windows update process, I've got the newest SP3 version. Many thanks."
,archp2008,2008-05-21T00:26Z,"Disk burned sucessfully, but Win XP installation ended in fatal error after first reboot (CRC) reporting bad copy.   "
,ambuj_sinha,2008-06-29T18:15Z,"Guys, Please seed....Please"
,kender1,2008-07-09T03:07Z,"This works great!!!
Only thing. When updating it will ask to activate or just show the available updates. Don't activate during update. change to ""just show the available updates""
Thanks cscmrwizard!!!"
,InrDmons,2008-08-19T05:26Z,"I've installed many ""MCE 2005"", but tey have all been 2002. I am trying to connect it to my Xbox 360. Can anyone confirm that this is indeed 2005 and not 2002???"
,Dalareaux,2008-08-22T01:06Z,"Thank you thank you thank you!  Fucking awesome, works perfect.  If you're having problems burning this or getting it to work, try using PowerISO to burn.  Worked on the first try for me.  Again, awesome man."
,nxcess,2008-08-25T04:27Z,"Man, I've been downloading various windows media center claiming to be 2005, but ends up being 2002. This one, however, is 2005. You can check for yourself. Open MCE > setting > general > about > software version. Guess all this wait was worth it. Took forever to download."
,callmecohenx3,2008-08-30T02:39Z,"I tried to install it and it asked me for the Key...
am I missing something?"
,avast4.8,2008-10-08T16:03Z,Thanks! This is work in my HP Compaq 6715s
,TheStorm01,2008-12-28T08:25Z,"i had this running for a few months now. and now it says ""you have 7 days left to activate...."" anyone else have activation problems? any other options?"
