,seagull38,2008-02-24T12:54Z,"downloaded it onto DVD disk and everything but when i go to play it, it just comes up with ""wrong disc inserted, please insert original ""Tiger Woods PGA (R) 08"" CD/DVD"" so how so i play it??"
,The-mAdmAn,2008-02-24T13:24Z,"Games works Perfect for me.
Running Vista and the games runs smooth even when broadcasting radio in the background and so on.

Thnx for the torrent Nuszer.."
,The-mAdmAn,2008-02-24T13:29Z,"seagull38...

You have to copy the crack from the dvd (found in Hatred directory) into the directory where you installed the game and into the BIN directory.

I guess that you installed it into the default path.
c:/program/EA games/Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 08
Then it should be placed in Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 08/bin
"
,awholelottalumps,2008-02-28T01:31Z,"Easy steps to play game.After you extract game and install it,then go to start menu and then all programs and find the folder EA Sports which Tiger woods 08 folder should be listed after install.Create desktop shortcut using the Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 icon.After that click on properties on the desktop icon you just created and then click find target.Locate your crack icon and then copy it and replace it with one original one in the bin folder.Also let me note I downloaded a crack from gamecopyworld.com which is listed under Tiger Woods 08 index under game fixes.Just download it and save it to a folder so you know where it is.The crack might work that came with this torrent,but I didn't try it,but if it doesn't then I have it covered.You don't need to burn anything to play the game just follow these steps and it should work.Anyone have any questions just ask,but I think I explained it as clearly as I could  have.Good Luck."

Use Peer Guardian II. I used to get notifications from my ISP too.  PeerGuardian will block all the known anti-P2P groups in the world and the list gets updated constantly. I never got a warning since using it.  Always run it before Torrenting.  It will also block known adware and spyware companies. Its excellent!"
