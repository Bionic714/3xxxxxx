The application itself is fine, but is absolutly useless without a serial number, as it functions barely enough to make any music. If anyone has the serial number or working crack, upload it as a torrent and make us all happy."

And the patch worked fine, but don't download any updates, FA soft updates always seem to defeat any cracks etc;"
