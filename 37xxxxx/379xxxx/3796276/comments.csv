Do you have any more seasons??"
,neilaroo,2007-11-09T17:20Z,anyone got the old series from the 1960s? I think it was the best.
,PaulBunyan,2007-11-23T20:06Z,"Hi. I'll seed all 6 of these on my pc just as long as i can. I collected the series myself too and shared it. 
I just wonder, are these 6 dvd's holding all 7 seasons..? 
I summed up and got total of ~26 G's of these dvd's and the package i shared contains ~38 G's
Allthought my package lacks quality, is there really all 7 seasons in ~26 G's..?"
,PaulBunyan,2007-11-30T14:40Z,"Now i got the idea. These 6 dvd's contain season 1.
Very good quality."
