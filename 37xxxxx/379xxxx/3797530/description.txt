Fantastic collection of music by on of the greatest bands ever. Includes:

The Presidents of the United States of America - Self Titled 10th Anniversary
II
Love Everybody
Pure Frosting
Freaked Out And Small
Ã‡a Plane Pour Moi (Single)

All of them are of varying qualities, none are bad. Pretty sure they're all properly tagged, too. Thanks for those who helped with the 10th anniversary edition.
