,lalojamesliz,2008-03-14T20:46Z,i have the same problem
,helpme363,2008-03-21T17:58Z,"i had the same problem lalojamesliz and Gouzman are having and my solution was:

1. restore ipod to original setting through itunes and do NOT update ipod fireware to version 1.3
2. follow [Maga]Zine directions
3. after ejecting and reconnecting ipod go to itunes - ipod games tab, make sure SYNC GAMES is unchecked and sync ipod

now i'm enjoying these wonderful games and hopefully these steps will help others out :)"
