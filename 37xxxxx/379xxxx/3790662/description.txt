:. about .:

Adventure Pinball: Forgotten Island is the first in a possible series 
of 3D pinball adventure games built using the Unreal Tournament engine. 
Journey through a series of linked pinball tables, each one more 
difficult to master than the last, to survive the perils of Forgotten 
Island. However, you cannot advance from one table to the next until 
you have completed a set of tasks that will open the entrance to your 
next adventure. Unlike other pinball games, the action in Forgotten 
Island does not take place on a tradition table, but on a living island 
landscape fraught with dangerous creatures and natural hazards. 
Dinosaurs roam the table, cavemen lumber about their daily business, 
and volcanoes rain molten lava down from above. It will take lightening 
fast reflexes, a steady aim, and an abundant supply of good luck to 
survive the exciting adventure that awaits you on Forgotten Island.
