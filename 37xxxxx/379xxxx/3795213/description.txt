On: BBC 2    

Nigella Lawson prepares good food fast. The focus is on evening meals as 
Nigella prepares a no-effort family roast dinner of poussin with sweet 
potatoes, a quick after-work supper of crispy squid with garlic mayo, 
and a home-alone meal of mustard pork chops with gnocchi. Plus there's 
an almost-instant caramel croissant pudding to be eaten in bed after 
a night out.
