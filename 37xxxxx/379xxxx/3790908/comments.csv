Anyways, thanks for all the other books!"

,CamosunJ,2011-07-05T01:09Z,Very much would like seed for one part of this! (calculus early transcendentals 6e edwards penney)
,gromit1948,2011-08-26T11:41Z,"has anyone got the password(s) for the encrypted EXE file? especially this one: math\ele numb theory 5e goddard-rosen\Elementary Number Theory 5E - Goddard-Rosen.exe

thanks."
,gromit1948,2011-09-23T15:54Z,"The password for the encrypted RAR files is Inchmeter.  So I do feel a bit of a donut.  Many of the books just seem to be the answers without the textbook to go with it, so not much use really."
