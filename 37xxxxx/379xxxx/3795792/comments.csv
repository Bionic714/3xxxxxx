Yeah its a decent game from back in the day, used to play this all the time on my N64."
,KayossZero,2007-09-06T00:45Z,"Also quick note, for some reason two of the songs are listed as not complete but they are. I'm not sure why my Utorrent client is saying song 1 is not downloaded when I can play it with any media player."
[T],Booster2,2008-02-20T13:49Z,"This version you have uploaded: I'm the one who have who created this release and  separated the game and the soundtracks. In the beginning I didn't know what to rip it on, so I only ripped it in ""Nero"". Problem is that Nero doesn't rip the game and soundtrack in 1 file. So I had to rip the game and then rip the tracks after. Also because others who asked me could include the soundtracks. I thought to re-rip the game again and upload it here on TPB. Just for the nostalgia. ;)"
,Walkmountain,2008-04-17T20:50Z,"Anyone please!! I have no music in the game no matter how many different setups I try with my computer. The game runs perfectly with graphics and sound effects (voices, video sequences, Lasers, doors, etc), but still no music....??? :S Can anyone please help as I really love this game, and tried it out on the Project64 emulator which sucked do to the flickering screen. That Rom had the all the music and effects though... :( The music makes it all in Star Wars games... Please E-mail or something to: peter__stromberg@se.abb.com /Regards, Peter"
,KayossZero,2008-08-15T11:14Z,"Booster2, Hey I didn't know you created this and sorry if it looked like I was trying to take credit thanks goes to you!

Walkmountain, you need to play the music included with this release on a media player,  almost as good as the real thing"
,sinister_green,2008-08-17T23:07Z,"I already got the game, but please keep seeding. Im trying to d/l the music in this game is awesome"
,sinister_green,2008-08-18T00:47Z,"Thanks for seeding, I got the mp3s d/l'ed suprisingly fast for having 4 seeders and 4 leechers, 
I will keep sedding as long as possible

in refrence to the first question, it was released in '96 for the N64 and (I believe '97) for the PC. It is in fact based on the book ""Shadows of the Empire"" by Joel McNeely. And on my final note, here is an interesting quote from Wikipedia
 ""In the Nintendo 64 version of Shadows, the supercomputer housing the Death Star II's plans, when viewed from a sufficient distance in Dash's perspective, greatly resembles an actual Nintendo 64 game console with a Shadows cartridge plugged into its slot."" "
,sinister_green,2008-08-18T00:51Z,"While I'm AtAt it. . .
(get it?) I was talking about incredible music earlier.
Check out track 12. its my fav, In Empire Strikes Back, its the part where Luke is about to walk into Vaders trap.
02:25  is badass, I dont cARE whou you are or what you know abou music, or John Williams"
,Clerk13,2009-05-25T23:06Z,"I downloaded this game, and I really wanna play it, but it always sez there's no CD, and the crack i downloaded was just a registry file. Help, please. LoL"
,sukhiextreme,2010-01-29T14:27Z,"I installed the game,the problem is no enemies and my own ship displays on screen and i`m using xp os."
,sukhiextreme,2010-01-29T14:30Z,"Why is it doing that,the game comes on perfect and music works,as i mentioned no enemies and my own ship doesn`t come on screen,it just shows background graphics,can anyone help me on this."
,Shiniyah,2010-09-19T04:49Z,"Anyone know if there's a way to get this to run on Windows 7 64 bit? I've tried compatibility mode for Win95 as well as running as admin. I'd love to give this a shot again, but I'm SOL if I can't run it on this rig."
,RC_Ebooks,2010-10-21T15:13Z,"I am having some good fun with this, but I cannot get past Boba Fett's ship. Real tough. Surprising there are no easy cheats online for this, only the NO CD crack. Other thing I really dislike is that you can't save games, you need to RESTART the level from scratch, not even skipping levels! WHOA, that sucks!"
,Grenade123,2011-05-09T05:59Z,"When i try to install it it say to try to run it from the disk drive, i do and i run setup and its incompaible and i cant change it to windows 95 can someone plz help?"
,RC_Ebooks,2011-10-21T05:45Z,sinister_green: You're retarded.
,TheDeathDoctor,2011-10-31T15:11Z,How are you supposed to play it?
,exarro,2012-03-11T01:36Z,"i get ""unsupported 16-bit application"" when i try to run setup.exe. if you're running windows 7 64-bit or any modern operating system this will most likely not work. tried different comparability modes. didn't do anything. i have no idea what to do here. oh well. i don't think it would work anyway even if i was able to install it."
,i-copeland,2012-06-10T12:42Z,"HELP
Launcher says this:

The shadow setup program could not be run from launcher. You may try running SETUP.EXE directly from the shadows CD-ROM disk."
