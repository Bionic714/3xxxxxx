The players participating in HSP4 have millions at stake ready to win 
  or lose it all...maybe on a single hand. 

  HIGH STAKES POKER: Season 4 promises to be the richest cash game on 
  TV. Get set because the last seven episodes of this new season will 
  showcase $5 million+ on the table. Once again the world's top players 
  and personalities face-off against newcomers putting-up at least 
  $100,000 of their own cash in a private, no-limit game of Texas 
  Hold'em. The line-up of players includes the controversial Phil 
  Hellmuth (returning after a long absence) the legendary Doyle Brunson, 
  the charismatic Daniel Negreanu and 2006 WSOP champion Jamie Gold. 
  In addition, popular pros will also return including Mike 'The Mouth' 
  Matusow, Jennifer Harman, Barry Greenstein, Eli Elezra, Phil 
  'Unabomber' Laak, Sammy Farha, and Todd Brunson. 

  Risking fame and fortune, the stakes have never been higher!
