,vpvp,2007-09-02T03:45Z,"The 50,000,000 comes out of his ass. The entire population of Europe was about that in the 14th, 15th century. The true figure is around 3000-6000 over a 356 year period for the Spanish Inquisition (1478-1834), a few thousand more for the other Inquisitions -- the Roman Inquisition where Galileo was tried, and the Medieval Inquisition where the ""Alibgenses"" were slaughtered in southern France. The ""heretics"" were put to death by the State for the most part. Spain and France, where much of this took place, were Catholic countries, and treason to the State carried the death penalty (still does in some countries).

Two historical books that demolish ""Berean Beacon"" claims: Inquisition by Edward Peters, and The Spanish Inquisition: A Historical Revision by Henry Kamen. Both are Inquisition scholars who studied this stuff their whole lives.

""....the Spanish Inquisition, in spite of wildly inflated estimates of the numbers of its victims, acted with considerable restraint in inflicting the death penalty, far more restraint than was demonstrated in secular tribunals elsewhere in Europe that dealt with the same kinds of offenses. The best estimate is that around 3000 death sentences were carried out in Spain by Inquisitorial verdict between 1550 and 1800, a far smaller number than that in comparable secular courts."" (Edward Peters, Inquisition [1989], page 87)

James Hitchcock, a professor of history at St. Louis University, summarizes the conclusions of the best of modern Inquisition studies:

(1) The inquisitors tended to be professional legists and bureaucrats who adhered closely to rules and procedures rather than to whatever personal feelings they may have had on the subject.

(2) Those rules and procedures were not in themselves unjust. They required that evidence be presented, allowed the accused to defend themselves, and discarded dubious evidence.

(3) Thus in most cases the verdict was a ""just"" one in that it seemed to follow from the evidence.

(4) A number of cases were dismissed, or the proceedings terminated at some point, when the inquisitors became convinced that the evidence was not reliable.

(5) Torture was only used in a small minority of cases and was allowed only when there was strong evidence that the defendant was lying. In some instances there is no evidence of the use of torture.

(6) Only a small percentage of those convicted were executed -- at most one or two percent in a given region. Many more were sentenced to life in prison, but this was often commuted after a few years. The most common punishment was some form of public penance.

(7) The dreaded Spanish Inquisition in particular has been grossly exaggerated. It did not persecute millions of people, as is often claimed, but approximately 44,000 between 1540 and 1700, of whom less than two percent were executed.

,vpvp,2007-09-04T06:46Z,"Witnessed what specifically? The MYTH of the ""Inquisition"" portrayed in the video? Address my stats. The entire video of ""Berean Beacon"" is a biblical fundamentalist anti-Catholic piece of shit propaganada that has no connection to real history. I've listed Edward Peters and Henry Kamen. Read them for starters, there's plenty more historians that annihilate this anti-Catholic Bible Fundy video.

FACT (1) The Church's ""inquisitors"" acted with considerable restraint, far more than that of the secular courts.

FACT (2) MANY MORE people were killed by The Plague (the Black Death or Bubonic Plague claimed upwards of 50% of Europe at the time, about 25 million people) than were ever killed or even bothered at all by the various ""Inquisitions.""

FACT (3) There were no ""Bible fundamentalists"" hiding in the mountains, forests, and trees. The only Church around was the Catholic Church (along with the Orthodox which split with Catholics in the 11th and later centuries).

FACT (4) The Albigenses mentioned in the video were not Bible Fundys but gross heretics who were Gnostics / Manichees. They had a distorted Christ, distorted Bibles, and were a menace to society which is why many of them were put to death. The Albigenses Crusade was restricted to southern France.

FACT (5) The Inquisition claimed jurisdiction over Catholics only in Catholic countries (France, Spain, Italy [Rome] for the most part).

FACT (6) Ex-priest Richard Bennett is a FAG. Ok just kidding, I might have made that one up. On second thought, many priests are gay, but that is our problem, not yours."
,orinvee,2008-04-11T08:20Z,"vpvp: Your facts might have been credible if you hadn't countered with the same propagandistic BS as you claimed grinreaper used.

Your FACTS 1 and 3-5 are ALL bogus; only FACT 2 has any semblance of truth; FACT 6 is probable but irreverent...I mean, irrelevant. :-)

In your distinguishing the various 'Inquisitions' (Spanish, Roman, etc.), you left out the most atrocious Inquisition of all: the South American Inquisition! 

Fact 5 was especially preposterous. The RCC tried to exert its will wherever it went. Like Islam, the RCC's modus operandi was 'convert or die'! Whether we are talking about the Roman expansion into the British Isles or the Conquistadors in South America, the heathens were NOT offered freedom of religion. The RCC's motto? ""There can only be ONE!""

The Waldenses were another Christian congregation that were persecuted by the RCC and DEFINITELY not deserving of it. In fact, EVEN if the Albigenses were heretics, no teaching of Christ ever supported their persecution...only forgiveness and tolerance.

I know you love your church, Padre, but let's try to be honest: The RCC has gone astray from the teachings of our Lord.

I do agree with you, however, in that the numbers given are grossly inflated. Although 'the Beast' does love blood, the fear of 'the Beast' has prevented much bloodshed.

MYTH of the ""Inquisition"".... in denial much? lmoa"
