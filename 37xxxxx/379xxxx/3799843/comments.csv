1. You extract the file: mhu2-dgr.001 to a directory idk where.

2. Burn it with nero or wth choose a burn program, on a dvd.

3. When its finished, put de DVD in your PS2, and start killing.

REMEMBER your PS2 has to be modded to play te game."

,Mittalicous,2007-11-09T15:07Z,"to dGenerallll:
 this is what you need 2 do, it's really easy and simple.

1. Extract the rar-file to wherever you want.
2. Burn the extracted file (probably a ISO or bin/cue file) with Alcohol 120% to a dvd.
3. put the disc into your ps2, and PLAY ON! 

Good luck;)
