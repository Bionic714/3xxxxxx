The first 9 issues of the series Ennis promised would \"out-Preacher Preacher.\" While he\'s opened the door to some good character development ahead, it looks like he\'s talking less about Preacher\'s storytelling and more about the violence and sex. Wildstorm actually dropped the title, despite good sales numbers, after the first 6 issues. Download and see why.

Any if you like it, buy it! http://www.amazon.com/Boys-Vol-I-Garth-Ennis/dp/9133305463/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-5932021-8368064?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189007243&sr=8-1

It\'s not like the comic book industry is booming these days. Make sure Ennis gets some beer money for his hard work.
