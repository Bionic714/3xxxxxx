 i would shure seed, but maybe U could have them up for a while longer or just do a couple at a time due to your bandwith.?
I bet then u would find other p seed, I think most dont have the whole file yet regardless of Pbs statistics...

Tx thou.

Since Ur the only 1 that we know have the WHOLE files, some more seeding time on these would be much appreciated. (1, 6-17)
