*  It's about some campers discovering something they should not have seen.
*  With the help of a special military group they go out to take on these
*  strange people in their white-hooded dresses. There is killing. There
*  are explosions. Limbs get torn off. Stunning special effects made with an old
*  Amiga 500 + genlock! There are lots of subtle jokes and references, so keep
*  an eye out!
