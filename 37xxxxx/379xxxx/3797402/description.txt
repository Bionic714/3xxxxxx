No. 17 AP ranked PSU (Big Ten Conference) going into the season vs the unranked Florida International from the Sunbelt Conference. Recorded from the Big Ten Network via s-video (sorry, thats the best I can do). Stay tune next week for PSU vs Notre Dame, will be released 16x9 since it will be on ESPN HD. By the way can someone confirm that this release works on iPod, AppleTV, PS3, X-Box 360? Any input would be appreciated. I know it works in QuickTime WinXP. Enjoy!

See my previous torrents for other PSU releases.

WE ARE ... PENN STATE!
(We dont give a Notre Damn!)

cheers,
