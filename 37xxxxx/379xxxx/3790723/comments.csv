,aherrera,2007-08-31T19:52Z,Dude... you think planet Earth is the only inhabited from all those billions planet and stars? Wow.... I guess thats a one in a billion chance.
,L.Jamf,2007-08-31T22:35Z,What's all the talk about believing in unidentified flying objects? It seems highly unlikely that all flying objects should be identified at all times.
,Mshabaz,2007-10-01T01:14Z,"just wanna let hunter know that there's more documented evidence of UFO's than GOD..... just a little tid-bit i'd like to let u in on.. this isn't about religion, this is about the very high probability that UFO's are real and do exist... why the hell not??? just run the numbers of possibilities of other life forms, and compare that to the fact that it takes years for civilians, if an eternity to use ultra-high sensitive telescope equipment for casual use, considering most are owned by governments....... what we need is more open-minded individuals on this earth to make a damn difference, instead of just shootin' the fuck out of people....

,bunglex,2008-03-21T20:15Z,"Guys don't reply to wanna be debunkers. This guy hasn't even looked into the the most ""know"" movies, coz they would explain answers to all his questions. Don't waste your time on people with closed mind and too lazy to look em selves.. Too many more important people need to be enlightened. Show THEM the facts, oh and let them reach there own conclusions."
,thingf1sh,2008-04-26T22:11Z,"I love this subject as much as the subject of ghost's do they exist who knows but everyone can't deny people do see things that can't be explained, and with the theoretical science of ""string theory"" maybe they will find faster than light travel is possible but until then I will remain an sceptic as this is the only thing to me that disproves alien visitors, but do aliens exist of course even to the point of intelligent life  "

Please S E E D it!"
,o770,2008-09-16T01:52Z,"Poor quality. Also GSpot reports ""file truncated in the 'legacy index' area - 1 byte missing"" - perhaps caused by the download... I don't know. I've got no hash failure. Video looks like a very old VHS tape."
,miensch,2009-01-21T15:50Z,"Many of us are stuck at 99.6% There is a seed, but for some reason the seeder will not share the remaining 2 pieces. Can another seeder come back, please?

Looks like an interesting movie. Thanks! :)"
,miensch,2009-01-24T10:24Z,"Finally got 100%. Thank you! Good movie. The video is quite blurry as is typical of UFO documentaries, but it is very fun to watch. It is not like you should ever expect to see HD/crystal-clear shots of UFO's, so it is acceptable and expected. :)

,DavidRavenMoon,2009-07-13T05:26Z,"Hunter1980: ""Why should they travel billions of light year to visit earth without trying to communicate with planet earth? ""

Do a little research on the subject.  They aren't traveling billions of light years, etc., etc.

They certainly DO exist as they have been seen my millions of people.

Also they do communicate with us, just a few people at a time, since that is safer than the angry mob that would result otherwise.  Humans are a dangerous bunch of creatures.  Look at what we do?  We kill each other on a daily basis.

Can someone seed this, please?"
,DavidRavenMoon,2009-07-13T05:32Z,I actually have this on VHS recorded from the TV. I don't think it was ever on DVD.
