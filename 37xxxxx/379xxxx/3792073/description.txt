This speech is the entire content (except menus) of the DVD archived in RonPaulInIowaJune302007DVD.iso, 3.74 GB. The sound is generally more intelligible here, and the picture may be more appealing. Also, it should transfer in about 1/7 the time.
Still, the sound is not always understandable and has a room echo due to the poor pickup. The picture is at best shaky. Commercial TV quality it's not. If you can get better sound AND/OR picture for this speech, please post it.
