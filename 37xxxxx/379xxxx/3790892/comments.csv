,anindya,2007-08-31T22:46Z,"Told you, it works. :)"
,Clapton,2007-08-31T22:57Z,Works flawlessly and softly as a morning sunrise here. At least didn't crashed when loading first mission like another cracks did. Thanks to the genius who made it! 
,s-y-n-c-m-a-s-t-e-r,2007-08-31T23:09Z,"yes, i can confirm, this one really works!!!!

THANKS A LOT !!!

...a big ""fuck you"" to all fakers in the past !!

and a big LOL to 2K games!!"
,sparkey-b,2007-08-31T23:29Z,When I install I says insert Original DVD/CD - all I can do is RETRY or CANCEL - what am I doing wrong ??
,Fleischregen,2007-08-31T23:35Z,"It's indeed working. But ZoneAlarm told me the following after I launched the Bioshock.exe:
""Bioshock.exe is attempting to monitor user activities on this computer. If allowed it may track or log keystrokes (user input), ... "" and so on. Denied - the game's still working. "
,iLEZ,2007-08-31T23:42Z,"Great! Finally!

I am having the same problem as sparkey-b though. Any suggestions? Seems like it tries to download ""the latest bioshock patch"" or someting similar, and then asks for the original ISO.. *ahem* DVD.. ;) A mini-ISO of Bioshock? Trying later... 

Everyone gets a little nervous when a game ""calls home"" in this way. Can't say i like it."
,KingeleN,2007-09-01T00:41Z,Is this for the ONEhitWonder Bioshock version? Because I don't know how to use it. The bioshock folder is getting removed after the activation over internet fails. So how am I suppose to use this?
,anindya,2007-09-01T01:03Z,"Use the mini image to install the onehitwonder version. Make two virtual drives using daemon tools. Mount the onehitwonder image in the first and the mini image in the second. And then install the game. It will install fine. After that copy the crack to the install folder and run the game. :D

Heres the mini image http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3785220/Bioshock_mini-image.PROPER.Skullptura"
,anindya,2007-09-01T03:23Z,"@kapula

You dont need to do that if you use the mini image. ;)"
,Graeme1973,2007-09-01T12:54Z,"ok, ive installed paul.dll and bioshock.exe. i dont have a clue about running secu.eg. reg.. any help people."
,sparkey-b,2007-09-01T14:47Z,"Hi everyone - the crack works for me - many thanks to original uploader

Keep the Faith !"
,Graeme1973,2007-09-01T15:50Z,@ kapula. thanks for the help. works great
,Graeme1973,2007-09-01T15:58Z,"for anyone who doesnt have the iso version. when you install bioshock it asks you to insert cd. hit control, alt, del goto programme files and 2k folder and change name of folder to xbioshock then go back to install and xc install.then change file name back to bioshock this way you get the programme file, then apply crack. then enjoy playing bioshock"
,mynameiznone,2007-09-01T21:42Z,"im going to be away for awhile so here is the post i made that will help you install bioshock with the crack (KainBG im trying to see if i flash my gpu bios from a 7300gt to 7600gs will fix the blue screen problem so far my video card hasent died trying to flash it)

,Soduka,2007-09-12T22:29Z,I'll buy Bioshock as soon as they get rid of that ridiculous install limit and intrusive copy protection. Until then they can look at my 50$ from a window while I enjoy their game.
,Swedeishmeatball,2007-09-13T01:38Z,"You know what, I would normally agree with Ashris9922, but 2k Games Really did it this time. They are the first game company to truly piss me off. I was so pumped for this game, i was planning on buying it untill i heard that you have to activate it, which not only is an annoying and tedious process, but once you actiavte it more than twice, YOU HAVE TO BUY A NEW FUCKING COPY.

Har prøvd reinstall. Noen som har en løsning?

Have done everything the guide says. The error message is:

Anyway, once again, you don't need to kill the installer or anything. Just use a mini image. Make two virtual drives. Mount the mini image on one and the main ISO on the other and then start the installation.

Also if you are having problems with this crack, new ones are available from Fairlight."

,powerskater92,2008-06-03T08:38Z,"I think the reason you can only see the fire and the water looks like pixels is because your graphics card is not good enough.

I just download a patch for an illegal copy just under Bioware's nose.

Thank you very very much.

Now to my graphics card to the test ;)"
,juanitostained,2008-06-10T04:08Z,"so my card didn't pass the test. but it's the game fault. 

the game's made with Pixel Shader 3, while most graphics cards have Pixel Shader 2.

if you experience something like

 "" I can only see fire, and nothing else, at the beginning of the game "", 

this is the sign that your graphics card doesnt support Pixel Shader 3. go to shadershock.tk

users are making changes to the game so you can play with Pixel Shader 2.

it¡s a work in progress, so it doens't look as good as the original right now, but it is very very playable. and wonderfully so, too :)"

5) I place the crack exe and the Paul.dll into c:Program Files\2K Games\Bioshock\Builds\Release

,Gamejunkiez,2010-09-16T14:42Z,"- This v1.0 crack 100% works. :)

Meaning you should NOT install any updates.

If you can not get this to work you COULD have updates installed.

- Mount the ISO and install the game.

- At the end of the install it will report that you have the WRONG disk inserted.
- Kill BIOSHOCKAUTOPATCHER and Bioshocksetup using task manager.
(If you do not do this install dir will be removed!)

- Copy all files from this torrent folder to: ?\BioShock\Builds\Release\

- Run ""Bioshock.exe"" as admin.

Hope this helps some people. :)"
