,MrMackey,2007-09-08T21:36Z,So how many bioshock torrents do we have on this tracker already?
,pedro.m.m.silva,2007-09-09T11:11Z,"other Bioshock torrent!?!?!? and one more, probably, fake. no Info, no team, nothing. Stop post faker here.

If you want a working version, download ONEHiTWONDER version (6.05GB) and the Scene crack. Two guy's said me that it is working. when I install it I told you if works or not."
,otool,2007-09-10T10:53Z,"this is the fully working game but to play you must install microsoft visual C++2005 sp1 redistributable package(x86)
