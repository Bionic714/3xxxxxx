,pn_trash72,2007-09-01T16:48Z,how do i seed?
,fnog,2007-09-01T21:37Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!

This is another BROKEN Crack!"
,Budge4,2007-09-02T01:22Z,"Yea Bioshock has finally been cracked.

Once you've finished downloading torrent pn_trash72 just let it carry on rather than stopping it, you are seeding files back to other people that want torrent then."
,Mochan,2007-09-02T08:21Z,"Folks, this is the real deal! I just got the game up and running. Be sure to follow the instructions.

All hail Dark Coder. And no I am not Dark Coder using an alt account. Oh and thanks EricTorrent for the crack. "
,firefoxinc,2007-09-02T09:46Z,It works!
,mindwarpcz,2007-09-02T09:57Z,"Yeah, it really fully works!!! Thank you very much Darkcoder, at least I can play Bioshock!

BTW, I have ONEHITWONDER version of Bioshock, and I skipped step 3 in darkcoders instructions. I tried to play it with normal big image mounted in daemon and it starts and runs ok. Now I am in the Medical Pavilion.
So, it works, and it is tested with ONEHITWONDER version."
,fnog,2007-09-02T14:15Z,"uhh hey maybe you didnt know this but NOBODY knows how to get the update tyo instale withotu getting the insert the original disck error.

how about fixing that"
,slick7,2007-09-03T03:18Z,I keep getting insert original disc not the back up....and then it cancels the installation and closes y does it do that....HELP
,babbletech,2007-09-03T08:09Z,"I decided to be generous and share my knowledge:
You need the following to in order to get this to work:

* ONEHiTWONDER (OHW) release of Bioware of any other one will work as well
* Gamecopyworld's mini image #3. Download at http://m0007.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_bioshock.shtml#Bioshock%20[MULTI5]%20No-DVD/Fixed%20Image%203
* Download this torrent (the one you're lookign at)
* Alcohol 120% (tested) or DaemonTools (untested). I know this works with Alcohol 120% but it will probably work with DaemonTools though I have not tried it.

Here is what you have to do:
* Mount the full ISO (OHW) 
* Install Bioware. Go to next step after it attempts to download updates and complains about wrong disk
* Mount the mini image from GameCopyWorld (GCW)
* Hit the ""RETRY"" button. Go to the next step after it complains about wrong volune or something like that
* Mount the full ISO (OHW) again
* Hit contine or OK button. I forgot the exact name but you can figure it out.
* Finish the installation. Do not start the game. Exit the installation.
* Mount the mini image again
* Install this crack as directed.
* Start the game and enjoy

This crack works for sure - I tested it and I approve of this message."
,babbletech,2007-09-03T08:22Z,"When I said ""Bioware"" in the last post, I meant ""Bioshock"" obviously. I was drunk so excuse me. At least I'm trying to help !!

Bioware is a game company BTW."
,Prof_Oak,2007-09-03T12:44Z,"iND made a perfect working crack and activation bypass long before this 1. I tested and worked

U can search Pirate Bay to find it.

So, I cant understand the big deal here.
I even prefer iND crack to be honest."
,Kowalski1977,2007-09-03T14:21Z,"If it's any news to people wanting to back this game up onto a dvd I would advise backing up the game installation folder (after full installation of the game) as well with cracks provided/0verwritten the originals, that way you can copy the folder onto any XP/Vista Machine, run darkcoders registry edit and off you go game should be playable, if you noticed when installing the game you had to download a patch via internet connection, by backing up the installed game you won't need internet to get this game running on other PC's, many of u prolly have this sussed, but just to let ppl know"
,derelikt,2007-09-03T15:57Z,"Just wanted to shout out a thanks for those who helped this torrent get here, and a BIG thanks to Babbletech, for supplying the first worthwhile ""Bioshock Installation for Dummies Guide"".  I've had the image for quite sometime now, and after poring though literally hundreds of posts and different installations instructions in literally each of them, I couldn't figure out how even how to get past the ""insert the proper disk"" message.  I could care less if there are other ways to do it or not.  Your instructions are clear, consise, and most of all they worked!  The game works like a charm, and I'm off to fight the ghoulies. THANK YOU THANK YOU!"
,MJLambert,2007-09-03T18:45Z,hmm cant get it to work. game wont fetch the updates. installs but then gives me an error about backup disk....any ideas guys? do i have to use the onehitwonder iso? or is any iso useable?
,MJLambert,2007-09-03T18:55Z,"ok i figured it out. if you cant get the patches to download, once you get the error message for the correct cd, just open task manager, and stop the installation process, and the bioshock autoupdater, and then copy the paul.dll file into the builds/releasefolder. 

basicly follow babbletechs instructions, but on the 2nd line where it says ""gets the patches"" just stop the installation process, and the autoupdater, and then follow his instructions.

this should help u guys out i hope."
,Urinat0r,2007-09-03T21:37Z,"babbletech, that gamecopyworld dl link didnt work.. anywhere else to download?"

,electro cute,2007-09-04T03:45Z,"i tried to follow these instructions. i have bioshock onehitwonder version, and daemon tools with securom option enabled. i've downloaded this crack. i installed the game, and at the end of the instalation program i get this message:

downloading the latest bioshock patch

and then:
wrong disc inserted. Please insert the original ""bioschock"" cd/dvd. Please have a look at http://www.securom.com/message.asp?m=wrongdisc for further, more detailed information.

and then i tried to mount that gcw image #3 but it appears broken, and it doesn't help. and then i tried just stopping the instalation progress through task manager, but it doesn't help either.

has anyone installed this game by using daemon tools? any sugestions? "
,fnog,2007-09-04T04:51Z,WTF is d3dx9_33.dll and why do I need it to start the dammed game?!?!?!?!
,derelikt,2007-09-04T08:02Z,"Fnog, you are referring to a DirectX file, it's obvious why these files need to be in order for the game to work properly.  I found this at the bioshock tech support site

http://support.take2games.com/cgi-bin/take2games_en.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=479&p_created=1187550898&p_sid=pshYPQKi&p_accessibility=0&p_redirect=&p_lva=&p_sp=cF9zcmNoPSZwX3NvcnRfYnk9JnBfZ3JpZHNvcnQ9JnBfcm93X2NudD00OTUmcF9wcm9kcz0mcF9jYXRzPSZwX3B2PSZwX2N2PSZwX3NlYXJjaF90eXBlPWFuc3dlcnMuc2VhcmNoX25sJnBfcGFnZT0z&p_li=&p_topview=1

Basically you need to reinstall DX.  Don't expect it to work at least until you do this."
,ciscoman,2007-09-04T13:30Z,"i'm following babbletechs advice,  but when I mount the mini image it justs opens up a folder with heaps of files...there is no RETRY button in there at all and it doesn't re-open installation...I then tried remounting main image and just opens the same folder up???
So basically i got as far as just installing the main image and it said couldn't download the crack (error 1000) or something...that's when i tried the mini image part.

What is happening please?
I've used alcohol120 for every game I have played and never had this happen :(
"
,Caleidoo,2007-09-04T22:03Z,"Works like a charm. And you don't need the miniimage... just abort installation when asked for correct disc and copy/paste these files into your installation directory. oh and dont forget to run secu.eg.reg.
kazaam! your done, go play with yourself"
,ciscoman,2007-09-06T05:05Z,"Forget last comment...I downloaded daemon tools and followed easy ass instructions for mounting mini image etc. on that and worked first time!
Awesome game for sure!!!"
,Apocalypse7887,2007-09-06T19:26Z,"The mini image doesnt work (the one from GCW #3) and there is no 'RETRY' button..

For the Image, I downloaded one from this torrent site.
As soon as the installer asks for the non-backup disk you can't do anything to resume the installation. You can only select OK, then the installation fails.

I'm not new to this at all. I downloaded ""bioshock pc dvd c1897"" from BTJunkie, so This must be a bad installation file (though on their forums, they say it works..)

The ONEHITWONDER torrent has very little uploaders and downloaders.

Trying the ""BioShock PROPER-LOLCATS"" from BTjunkie. I'll let any one know if its better.

Any more info on how to install this game would be great.
thanks."
,Apocalypse7887,2007-09-06T19:29Z,"Oh, and I forgot to add..

I'm not sure where to put the crack (I assume the same place as the Paul.dll) as up to the point where it wants to download the patch, there is no .EXE in that directory.
Adding the crack to that directory just gives me and error and suggest that I reinstall.."
,Apocalypse7887,2007-09-06T23:09Z,"The torrent ""BioShock PROPER-LOLCATS"" installs fully, but when I run the .exe (with or without the crack) I get ""application has failed to start... Reinstalling may fix this""

maybe its the copy again.. I'm not sure. Also trying ""Bioshock.2007.PC-Rip.Full.Game.English.Skullptura""
I'll post If I get that working.."
,Apocalypse7887,2007-09-06T23:52Z,"Well, I'm dumb. Turns out I needed to install the 'vs redist' Which is located on the ISO. (instructions are in the .NFO, open with MS Word)

Hope this helps. the ""BioShock PROPER-LOLCATS"" torrent does work, and I would suggest you download that one if you're having problems.

Enjoy the game!!"
,MJLambert,2007-09-07T13:23Z,"Re; electrocute.

when you get to that stage where it says "" goto blah blah blah"" just open up task manager, and stop the bioshock autoupdater, and the exe that is installing the game. 

as long as you do this BEFORE you click ok to the error message, your ok. once you click ok though, it wipes you 2k directory.

just end the exe's and then follow on babbletechs advice from stage 3 onwards."
,ender13,2007-09-08T18:11Z,"ok listen up ppl, i'm gonna try clear out this whole mess and explain each step in a simple way to get this great game working for ya:

1)  Load a valid ISO
2) Start installing game
3) When installation is over you should get the ""Insert correct Bioshock CD/DVD"" message with a Retry and Cancel buttons. Do not click on any of them.
4) Open up Task Manager(Ctrl+Alt+Dlt), go to processes and right click on the ""BIOSHOCKAUTOPATCHER"" and end the process.
5) Go to applications tab and end Bioshock installer task.
6) You should be back at your desktop now and now comes the tricky part: Explore the valid ISO at My Computer  and locate the folder  ""vs redist ""within it. run ""vcredist_x86.exe"" and let it finish.
7) now copy/paste the cracked files ""paul.dll"" and ""bioshock.exe"" in Builds/Release folder where you installed the game. Replace if asked.
8) Run ""secu.eg.reg"" and accept it into the registry.
9) You dont need the ISO in your drive or any Image on Daemon to play the game, you are all set
10) Go run Bioshock.exe (maybe make a shortcut of it on your desktop :P)
11) Enjoy ;)

lots of love
ender"

,keuller,2007-09-25T01:54Z,"Help,

""binkw32.dll"" not found so I installed binkw32.dll into my windows/system32 directory (as suggested by google search), but now I get an error saying

""The procedure enry point _BinkSetMemory@8 could not be located in the dynamic link library binkw32.dll""

The entire install process as described in ender's post goes without a hitch until I try to run. . . . 

Help?"

Anybody?"
,mrbum123,2008-01-29T23:16Z,"i figured out the big mystery on how to install it, when it updates and asks for the right disk, end it in task manager(control-alt-delete) you will need to end one item in the aqpplications tab, and on in the processes tab, they will both say bioshock in the name, then navagate to the bioshock directory(probably C:\programfiles\bioshock)
once in the bioshock folder open the builds then release folder, rename the paul.dll to paul.old, then copy the paul.dll from the crack, and the cracked bioshock.exe into that directory as well, then make a shortcut on your desktop directed to the bioshock.exe, Enjoy."
