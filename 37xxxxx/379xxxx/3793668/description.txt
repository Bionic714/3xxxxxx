I'm looking to clean up my computer and get this stuff off here.. this is fun for a bit of a laugh.

This is lecturer John Hall of the University of Florida during a class when he's obviously really really high on something.  The first video is the best - the second is the class later in the day I think.

These are original files that were hosted on the University server before they got taken down.  They're unedited, which means you'll have to sit through a lot to see the better parts.  It's also fun to watch the students looking at each other awkwardly during this professor's escapades..

I think the second video of this is on Google video, but the first video got removed.

Anyhow, download this and spread it around..
