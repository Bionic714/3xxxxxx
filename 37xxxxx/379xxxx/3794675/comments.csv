Here's something from the net mate



MCing is the art of rapping. MC stands for ?master of ceremonies?, and that is exactly what MC?s were. Early rappers were simply there to host the party. In the early days of hip hop the DJ was the main attraction. Hip Hop started when DJ Kool Herc came to New York, from Jamaica in 1970. Herc invented the ?break beat?, which allowed for easier dancing because of a continuos beat. Kool Herc brought with him, from Jamaica, a style of talking over tracks called ?toasting?. DJ?s had been toasting over reggae rhythms in Jamaica for several years and Herc copied this style and while playing sets would pump up the crowd by shouting things like, ?Throw your hands in the air / and wave them like you just don?t care!? This was known as ?rapping to the crowd?. Kool Herc invited his friends Coke La Rock and Clark Kent to MC for him while he cut up break beats, and this became the first rap group, called Kool Herc and the Herculiods. Other groups started copying the Herculiods and the rest is hip hop history.
