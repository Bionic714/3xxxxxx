Definitely a career high for Michael Keaton, an actor who is percieved to being, at times, something of a buffoon- but this movie affirms his dramatic talent. Anyone who's watched his career understands that he has always had this in him. Shame on the Academy for not acknowledging his wonderful performance here
I Love this movie
