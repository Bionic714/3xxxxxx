No Depression, Uncle Tupelo (Rockville, 1990)

Uncle Tupelo built on the idea that punk rock was American roots music just as much as Merle Haggard. Working the graveyard shift at the supermarket was like working in the factory. Getting drunk was getting drunk. Being broke was being broke. And while trying to shake your postadolescent ennui isn't the same as fleeing the Depression (a connection the band made on this album's title track, a cover of a Carter Family standard), songwriters Jay Farrar and Jeff Tweedy--later of Son Volt and Wilco, respectively--were so sure-handed that even the most dubious truths seemed self-evident. INFLUENCED: Whiskeytown/Ryan Adams, Palace Brothers, Drive-By Truckers
