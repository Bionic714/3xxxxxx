,pzoxicuvyb,2007-09-05T18:35Z,"The point of any religion is to explain the mysteries of life and offer a way to cope with reality. Fine. If that's all it does. If you live in a warzone or people close to you die from various deseases and you somehow find it comforting to believe in the afterlife, great. Halleluja.

But why the western civilization living in peace, with medical care, science, education, etc etc still lingers in medieval beliefs is mindboggling!

So in all fairness, muslims may be retarded, but what is our excuse?"
,phamalda,2007-09-05T21:06Z,"
pzoxicuvyb, I have no idea what your point is and I don't think you do either. When entering a battle of the minds, my advice is to not do so with a pea-shooter.

,pzoxicuvyb,2007-09-06T14:42Z,"phamalda, my point is painfully obvious: religion as a way of interpreting our existence is obsolete. there is no god, never was, never will be. feel free to prove me wrong.."
