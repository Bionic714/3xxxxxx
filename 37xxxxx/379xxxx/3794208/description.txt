Hari Om Tat Sat

ch#1: The master thief sound

BELOVED MASTER,
I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY, HARI OM TAT SAT: THE DIVINE SOUND -- THAT IS THE TRUTH.
WHEN YOU SPEAK I HEAR THE SOUND OF TRUTH RESONATING IN ME, YET I AM NOT ENLIGHTENED. HOW IS IT THAT I CAN RECOGNIZE THAT WHICH I HAVEN'T REALIZED?

Maneesha, Hari Om Tat Sat: the divine sound -- that is the truth... It is one of the mahavakyas, the great sayings which have been embedded in the hearts of the mystics since eternity. It is not something theoretical, not something philosophical, it is something existential...
