,Doors_Jim,2007-09-04T17:23Z,I would appreciate if you could fix swedish sub.
[T],z247,2007-09-05T18:22Z,"I will try. The problem is that the current version contains only Italian and Englisg subs. I think that my friend has a copy with many European languages, however, the version of the film is shorter than the above release."
,lermy,2008-01-22T01:54Z,seeda sn채lla!
,nano0268,2008-01-25T11:31Z,"This is an incredible movies.  Could easily say it's my favorite.  It has the most beautiful and moving ending to a movie I've ever seen.  Thank you for putting this up here, I wanted to watch it again before buying the director's cut."
,btop,2008-03-10T09:51Z,This version is awesome.. This is the Director's Cut. 2 hours and 47 minutes long. The quality's perfect. There's english HARD SUB embedded in the file. awesome torrent.

,kerouac1,2009-01-03T07:15Z,"I've seen the straight Italian version. It's a magnificent movie. Philippe Noiret, a Frenchman, steals the show. Many thanks for the English subs.  If you like this, check out Slumdog Millionaire."
[T],Arrrrrrrrrr,2009-07-08T05:53Z,"Excellent encoding, considering the size, of one of the most beautiful, emotional, amazing movies ever made. Pure magic. I cry like a baby at the ending every time, and I don't do that much.

Yes, there are hardcoded English subtitles but the framing is perfect; they were always just at the bottom of the screen for me and never clipped."

,frenzyface,2009-12-28T05:35Z,"thanks for uploading and seeding. audio, video and subtitles are working well."
,trinetra,2010-02-17T18:32Z,"Hey Coobanos ! The majority of the people in the world don't understand Italian language. If you want Cinema Paradiso without English subtitle then why don't you buy a dvd of it which has no embedded English subtitle instead of complaining. If you really like this movie then you wouldn't be complaining. If you really liked this movie then you wouldn't be complaining about such trivial matter. If you don't know how to thank then shut the fuck up ! 

Thanks a bunch z247 for this upload. Keep on doing the good work. "
,zahhman,2010-05-15T17:22Z,You ROCK.  Nice load...!
,puppyup,2011-02-06T09:24Z,Fucking hardsubs.
,AJNorth,2011-02-17T08:49Z,"Giuseppe Tornatore's picture captures the essence of the human experience - friendship and love sought, love gained and love lost come full circle. A film every cinephile should see, this movie is a tribute to film-making. The beautiful and evocative score by the legendary Ennio Morricone and his son Andrea fit the movie like a hand to a glove. The international version is a masterpiece; this is a masterpiece restored."
,Friend33,2011-03-07T18:53Z,Wonderful. Thank you for the upload. Looking forward seeing this film.
,PamanKecil,2011-07-27T13:46Z,Thanks to upload this great film. Keep seed...
