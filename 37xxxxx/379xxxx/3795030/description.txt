A beautiful story unfolds about the man's childhood friendship with an old man who was the projectionist at the local theater.

Just as I promised I am seeding the longer Italian version of the film. Please note, that the proportion of the video is different (1:1.66) than the intenational version, which is 49 minutes shorter. The DVD contains only Italian stereo audio (the international version Dolby Digital 5.1 in several language versions) and Italian and English subs. I embedded the English ones. It is single sided, the international one double sided (mainly due to many audio tracks).


I do hope you will enjoy the film. Believe me it is unforgettable.
