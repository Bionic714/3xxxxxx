RELEASE NOTES:
BioShock is the "genetically enhanced" first person shooter that lets
you do things never before possible in the genre: turn everything into
a weapon, biologically mod your body with plasmids, hack devices
and systems, upgrade your weapons and craft new ammo variants,
and experiment with different battle techniques in an
incredible and unique underwater city.

You are a cast-away in Rapture, an underwater Utopia torn apart
by civil war. Caught between powerful forces, and hunted down by
genetically modified splicers and deadly security systems,
you have to come to grips with a deadly, mysterious world
filled with powerful technology and fascinating characters.
No encounter ever plays out the same,
and no two gamers will play the game the same way.

PROPER NOTES:
This release does not require internet, nor does it have any serial or
activation part and you don't have to copy any cracked files over.
It's all been easied for your pleasure. MIAUW!
