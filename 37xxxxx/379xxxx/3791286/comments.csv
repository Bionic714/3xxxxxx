,hansdegebruiker,2007-09-03T12:56Z,Earlyer I told that the game worked fine but it isn't working fine. There is a driver isue (already installed the new beta drivers from NVIDIA) Some configurations (like mine) crash when you enter rapture. We have to wait on a patch or fix :(. By the way I tried a copy of a friend that he got in a store and it also crashes at the same spot. (me so lucky that I didn't bought it) when this version runs smoothly than I will buy my copy (not sooner).

,thomasrc2,2007-09-04T00:55Z,There is not a trojan in this game. It's supposedly a rootkit that installs with the game. Symantec is not catching it because it has been excluded from being caught because of verification by SOE that it's all good. If you remember this happened with a lot of DRM stuff with Sony CD's before. Just get's caught by other programs because of a lack of relationships with other big companies.

Third, I don't think they can log anything from tpb (once again, as far as I know).

,wirthith,2007-09-05T19:56Z,"How to make this work: First of all, download this torrent and also this:   http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3790892/Bioshock_Crack__WORKING_           

i dont really know how this torrent is, but i downloaded onehitwonder before and i write this and hopes it is the same things in this torrent ;)

1. Mount the ISO file with DAEMON tools or burn it, might be har to find that big dvd+r ;)
2. Now the installation will start and verything will seem to be just fine, but when the installation is almost done it will try to search the internet for a patch, and now the whole thing ends.
3. before pressing any bottom in the error message that pops up when it searches on internet, you go to   C/program files/          and copy the whole 2kgames folder.
4. now press cancel on the error message, and now the installation folder (C/program files/2kgames) will be gone, but you copied it, right? ;) now cut it in again.
5. the torrent that i linked earlier in the guide will ave like 4 files or something (poul.dll bioshock.exe, readme, and another file wich i forgotten the name of^^ )
6. copy the bioshock.exe and the poul.dll and cut in c/programfiles/2kgames/bioshock/builds/release     and press yes to switch the old poul.dll with the one you cutted in.
7. almost done now :D, just press the file in the other torrent of wich name i forgot, and press yes on the message that pops up.
8. DONE! :D:D:D:D go to the bioshock.exe file that you cutted in to the C/programfies/2kgames/bioshock/builds/release folder                 does the game starts now? :D




if this doesnt work you have probably understood me wrong or maybe this torrent is different to the OneHitWonder that i downloaded, but i tryed to explain this as good as i could, hope it helped you:D if it works, copy the text and paste to other comments, so that everyone can fix this problem :)"

Mount image with Daemon-tools? This release doesn't have an image nor can you build one from it. Data2.cab file is too large to add to MagicISO and that file is also unreadable.
