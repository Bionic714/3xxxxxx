,florin_mol,2011-04-06T22:31Z,"I used before Typing Master Pro on Windows Machines.
But Master Key for mac is way better. It just makes you eager more speed. It's just like a game you just want to get better an d better, to get to the next level. Brilliant.
Great torrent. Probably the best typing tutor at least in my opinion."
