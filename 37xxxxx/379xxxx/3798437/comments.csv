This is a big story. It's an attempt by the Illuminati, working through their number one propaganda production factory, the Tavistock Institute in the City of London, to create the illusion that the world is rapidly running out of oil and within a few short years, we will experience unemployemnt, wars, famine, and all manner of horrendous strife as a result of the fallout from the now ""rapdily vanishing"" oil supplies. It's a scam from top to bottom. If you've noticed that gasoline prices are beginning to rise at gas pumps across America, you can thank this deception for that jump in gas prices and you can also expect those gasoline prices to continue to rise over time and possibly remain at unprecedented high levels from here on out, UNLESS enough Americans wake up to this deceit and demand an end to it.

There are large numbers of people out there trying to promote this scam through books, articles, lectures, films, television and talk radio. In America, Michael Ruppert of From the Wilderness is apparently the lead disinformation meister of this flimflam. Amy Goodman of Democracy Now is a Ford Foundation & Rockefeller Foundation funded Left Gatekeeper who, with her brother, have joined with Ruppert to not only promote the Peak Oil scam, but is a regular propagandist for the Global Warming hoax fronted by Illuminatus Al Gore.

KPFK radio, a 100,000 kilowatt FM radio station out of Los Angeles, is one of the five national radio outlets owned by the Pacifica Foundation and has been unrelentingly hammering out the Peak Oil and Global Warming propagnada mantras since Ruppert kicked off this Tavistock-hatched disinformation campaing in 2004.

The only two people, that I am aware of, with any sizeable readership who have been trying to expose these outrageous lies and monstrous distortions of the facts are Dave McGowan through his newsletters and Joe Vialls in articles published at this web site. I'll use this page to post articles from writers and researchers who are trying to expose this pretense, starting with Dave McGowan and Joe Vialls. (Update: Jan 21, 2004. Found a good article exposing Ruppert from Patrick Mooney of www.unlearning.org).

1. I worked in the petrochemical industry for 40 years. The fact is the planet has already been surveyed for terrestrial oil fields. All of the big remaining ones are being produced.

Why do you think the industry began investing in deep well drilling in the ocean which is far more expensive then terrestrial drilling. We call that EROEI(Energy Return on Energy Invested)

Even the most conservative estimates by scientists in the field give the outlier of 2047 when peak oil begins it's decline, and that's based on current demand side numbers(China is changing those numbers up).

Then you must look at ""carrying capacity"" the mineral wealth required to keep the kind of culture we living going will deplete all earth natural resources we are using by 2100.

 Again that's based on current population figures.

Any academic will tell you worth their salt, when all they do is squawk about what liars all these conspiracy theorists propagate, yet provide no scientific basis for their alternative beliefs, you know were they are getting their information: The largest propaganda machine of manufactured consent on the planet-FOX NEWS.

If you want to know the truth then take the time to investigate it, by learning if you don't know how to read scientific studies.

Understand what the ""exponential function is""

This knucklehead must think the planet has an infinite amount of oil to last us for 10,000 years.

Worse-he must think you can dump 1.5 giga-tons of co2 into your atmosphere and expect zero impact. 

He must believe your dumb as rocks and don't know how balance rules the day with earth's living systems. He doesn't know squat.

Oil is a finite resource and he probably has never in his life been standing in a gas line for 6 hours waiting for gas like I did in 1973 when America hit peak oil.

 Dismiss it all you will, but ask yourself one question: Who has the most to lose & gain by this issue, and common sense answers that question."
,LoboSolitario666,2012-07-21T23:26Z,Hard to believe that there are people out there that think oil will last forever and that over-population in nothing to be concerned about. As for me it's just too dang crowded on this planet.
