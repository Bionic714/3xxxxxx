The War Collection: How Hitler Lost the War (1989)

 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243976/

Using rarely seen film footage, this documentary shows that Hitler's defeat in World War II was due less to Allied supremacy than to his own shortcomings as a military strategist.

Interviewing German officers, the film shows how the course of history could have been changed with a few key decisions.

Among them, Hitler's initial reluctance to bomb Britain; his refusal to proceed with the building of the Messerschmidt 262; his harsh treatment of the Ukrainians, who had welcomed Hitler as a savior from communism; and his biggest blunder, fighting a two-front campaign. This intriguing documentary recapitulates the major military events of the European theater of war.
