,Batojiri,2009-10-05T06:20Z,@ Sgipon english dubs are overrated for hentai they usually suck 100x worse than the original japanese cast because they are cheap sleezebag actors.
,rutch2509,2009-12-18T00:11Z,"I remember when this was advertised in 2000AD comic years ago.  The thing that got me on the advert were the words ""Extreme Violence & Gore!"", so my girlfriend bought it for my birthday.  Then I watched it and thought ""WTF!!!""  Even without the rudity, it's still a good film IMHO!  Thanks for the upload!"
