,noooober,2007-09-03T23:36Z,"This is the Actual Album with Explicit Lyrics. 

Thanks Pdawg."
,noooober,2007-09-03T23:42Z,"Nevermind! Maybe I should listen to the whole album first. The beginning and end of each track has a snippet of the song before or after.

NOT THE LEGIT ALBUM NOT ALL SONGS ARE EXPLICIT. 

ANOTHER BS UPLOAD."
