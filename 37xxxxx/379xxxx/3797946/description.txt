this is the cartoon that Bruno Bozzetto done for the "what a cartoon" series on Cartoon Network, in the 90's. it is a satire about the healthcare system, and being in the system, i can tell you it's straight to the point ;-)



 i've been looking for it for a few years, and i finally found it on google videos. it's a rather poor quality flash video file, and i have not recoded it. but you can play it in VLC with real-time denoising; although seeking does not work for flv files.
if you find any other release of this video, preferably as part of a DVD compillation, or a DVD containing the "What a cartoon" series, let me now so that i can mirror the torrent here (and give credit to its author too) and seed it.


Enjoy this as much as I did!
