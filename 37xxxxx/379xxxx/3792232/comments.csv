The loose change boys have made mistakes, or rather evidence has come out to change ideas.  It points a finger a bit too much, I'll give you that, but what is wrong with asking the who, whats, where, and hows.

Chaneys' stand down order?
Marvin Bush security contract for WTC expired 9/10/2001
Thermate(used in building demolitions) proven to be in wreckage


Every debunking video I have seen leave out the steel core.
Makes assumptions to get to their theory
Doesn't explain the Molten metal in the pile 3 days after
Can't explain how or why the transponders were turned off


Bahh,  people refuse to believe it because then they would have to do something.  Wether you believe it is a self inflicted wound or not, you must concede there are a ton of problems with the Official story.  The commission report wouldn't even try to explain building 7.

Organize the population into worker camps...  WTF


Or the ""military commission Act of 2006"" giving the Govt the right to torture ""AMERICAN"" children in their words now, with pliers and or sexually.  People have no idea how far this is.
