,tk88,2007-10-20T04:31Z,"Movie Reviews: Spanish gay porn? Sounds horrible!!! Its set by the pool and in a park and although the action is a good threesome and then twosome, the sound is just horrible and sounds like its dubbed in a room. Unless you know Spanish then this will sound like comedy more then porn. Oh yeah, and just so you know... there are commercials for Viagra popping in every so often during this 37.12 minute movie with two scenes. 

Video: 8.5 out of 10
Sound: 3 for voice over?

Verdict:  Erased as soon as reviewed thanks mostly to the comical sound.
