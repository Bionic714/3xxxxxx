,VEGA433,2007-09-03T07:01Z,HEXER!!!
,iflyc77,2007-09-11T07:25Z,thanks a bunch :]
,Raptor05121,2007-09-13T04:13Z,"HERE IS HOW TO INSTALL:

1.) Run the Installer.

2.) Run the crack. You should get an error message saying to search for it. Click ""okay"" and go to: ""C:\Program Files\FLIGHT1\AFX"" and select the .exe

3.) Click patch once, then to make sure you got it, click again. Close patch.

4.) DELETE the icon on your desktop. Then browse to: ""C:\Program Files\FLIGHT1\AFX"" and right click on ""AFX.exe"" and select ""Send to: Desktop""

5.) Run the .exe.  Enjoy!

6.) Note: When selecting FS9 or FSX for the first time, it will take about 3-5 mins for it to completely load. Once it has done this, future loads wont take as long. Please be patient!


Working method found by your truly!"
,ricko16,2007-09-13T18:29Z,"great its working fine. thx

req, AFS Designs A-380 without the banners>"
,AUA320,2007-09-14T18:59Z,"to raptor05121: hi dude! I do exactly like u describe in your post, but it doesn't work for me. i use fs9. do u mean we should install ver 1  and ver 1.01 first and then to use a crack. am i right? i did like that, but  it doesn't work in my case"
,chitragupta,2007-09-18T18:36Z,"I have followed steps for install how Raptor05121 wrote. But all time got msg: Invalid Licence?
Any idea???"
,AUA320,2007-09-19T02:41Z,i've got exacly the same message: Invalid Licence!
,blue02celi,2007-09-26T17:25Z,"are you getting the license prompt when you open it?  I installed the update and then ran the patch, no error"
,COLBY K,2007-10-11T08:24Z,"After MANY,MANY tries, i finally figured out how to get it to work!!!!!
I am running VISTA and i vouldn't get the crack to work. Here's How!!!!

1.follow the instructions as pre lined out from raptro05121
2. and when it comes time to cracking it, RIGHT Click on the "" CRACK"" and ""run as administrator""
3.IT WORKS!!!!!   LOL!!!"
,LP_Man,2007-10-13T00:55Z,"With all these instructions followed to a T, it still doesn't work. 'License invalid'.... over and over. Dud torrent."
,Blu3ice,2007-10-14T13:50Z,License invalid
,esdee44,2007-10-16T17:59Z,"I just downloaded it and find it works fine.

The v1.0 installs in \Program Files\Flight1\AFX folder.

When you run the update for v1.01 make sure you change the path for installation to this path. This is very important!

After running the update, run the crack, search for the path where the AFX.EXE is installed (C:\Program Files\FLIGHT1\AFX) and continue from there.

It will work :))"
,esdee44,2007-10-16T18:01Z,I forgot to thank you guys who have cracked it and put it up here. THANKS!!
,LP_Man,2007-10-24T23:27Z,"Ok, here's what happened and how it FINALLY worked for me.

I followed all the instructions posted here and i couldn't get it to work as it kept telling me 'license invalid'. What i noticed was after doing the 'crack' thingy, there was another folder created. Yep, FLIGHT1 is in there and then also in Program Files is another folder created alled AFX. Yep. Two folders of the same program. The .exe in the separate AFX folder is the one that worked.

Anyone have this happen (and work also)?"
,TheOnlyPilot,2007-12-14T03:45Z,"Hmm, not working for me. Gets up to 66.6% and then drops back to 50, and does that over and over and over.

Any ideas?"
,TheOnlyPilot,2007-12-14T03:50Z,"Okay, it was pretty simple figured it out.
Nobody has part of one of the files, so some seeders would be awesome..! 

(Unless I'm wrong?)"
,flyhan,2008-01-14T17:39Z,"Hi. 
you upload Airport Facilitator X is down one error. 
Be sure to ask for repair. 
Or ask for the latest version (1.4). 
seed plz...
Thank you very much."
,Gamepie,2008-01-24T20:07Z,"Thanks to the info above, mine installed ok the 3rd attempt

Is it safe to download the 1.04 update from flight1..........I wonder?"
,V_tom,2008-02-26T18:07Z,Norton reports trojan in crack file
,ciuuwb,2008-03-14T06:57Z,"esdee44's idea worked for me.
gamepie with v1.04 you need to go through the registration process which means you need a Cd Key etc"
,pappe,2008-03-17T09:16Z,Antivir also reports trojan in the crack file
,wazz786,2009-01-28T17:58Z,plz may i have the latest version 1.4 or 1.6?
,yosm,2009-04-15T13:02Z,"hi i downloaded it and installed it but when i start it it says license invalid 
can anybody please help???
i have Vista! 
thnq"
,yosm,2009-04-15T13:09Z,i can't see any crack file just the AFX installer and the update something wrong with my eyes?
,yosm,2009-04-17T09:08Z,"the version 1.6 is available simply 
1.install the Airport Facilitator X v1.01 
2.go to start then programs and search for flight1 folder
3. open it and there is a file called ''check for updates'' simply run it and you have version 1.6"
,G-BNWK,2009-06-18T00:18Z,"...except you can't upgrade to 1.6 or 1.7 because it replaces the AFX.exe with an unpatched one, and comes up with License Invalid.  v1.01 is fine, perfectly happy with that - Thanks!"
,grosvenor1234,2009-07-29T22:32Z,"This is shocking, it doesn't even work when im doing everything that others tell you to do. it still comesup with invalid crap. Can someone help me cuz i aint no computer wizz haha"
