Best Kissers in the World -- Been There (1993)

The Best Kissers in the World craft catchy power-pop with enough hooks to outfit a fishing expedition. With more edge than standard radio pop, the band offers a poppy punch which flirts with pop punk, though never makes the commitment to the sound. The result is a sound between the Posies and Green Day, and should be able to satisfy both indie rockers and low-key punks at once.
