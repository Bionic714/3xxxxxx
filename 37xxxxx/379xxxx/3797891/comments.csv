,serotoninjunkie,2007-12-17T07:56Z,"After you download sacrifice, you just go into the file and click the Splash.exe or install and just install it.. you dont need to mount or unrar. All you need after is a no cd crack"

More keys that maybe work

You can play singleplayer fine with one key, but you can't play against someone on the net who has the same key as you."

,cazpotato,2011-02-23T03:27Z,"@dondon92 I've heard you get that error if you have more than a few GBs of memory, since when Sacrifice was released most computers didn't have more than around 256mb. When I got that error on another computer I fixed it by reducing the paging file.


So the full fix is ""Haven't tried this software but had same problem with some other software, the error message: ""Director Player 6.0 - This program requires at least 3MB of free virtual memory to run"". The only fix is to change your virtual memory settings to something below 500mb or to exactly 4000mb. Of course, I chose 4000mb since I have a large hard drive and almost 1 gig of memory on this pc.

So the full fix is:
From the Windows XP desktop, select the Start button, right-click on the My Computer icon, and select Properties from the resulting menu.

Click on the Advanced tab to bring it forward, and then select the Settings button within the Performance section.

In the Performance Options window, click on the Advanced tab to bring it forward, and then select the Change button in the Virtual Memory section.

Click the Custom size button...
Change the Initial size (MB) setting to 4000
Change the Maximum size (MB) setting to 4000

Select SET to accept the change, which will close the Virtual Memory window. Select OK to close the Performance Options window. And select OK to exit the System Properties window. ""

Thanks don"

For anyone having issues with Sacrifice using the above hardware/software combo, try the following fix (originally from sacrificeplanet.net):

*** Install Sacrifice Patch #3 (google it) ***

**Download Latest Nvidia Drivers** http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us

1) Download Nvidia Inspector. http://downloads.guru3d.com/NVIDIA-Inspector-1.94-download-2612.html

2) Open it and under driver version select profile settings (located in the middle of the program).

3) Then have the ""_GLOBAL_DRIVER_PROFILE (Base Profile)"" selected or you can make another one specialized for Sacrifice. (located at the top of the window you opened). Then click ""add application current profile"" and add the original sacrifice.exe.

4) Click ""Scan Nvidia Predefined Profiles..."" (located to the upper right hand side of the window)
*Please Note*: If you can't do this then you must first click ""Create a desktop shortcut to run profile settings"" (located to the upper right hand side of the window) and run the shortcut then scan ""Scan Nvidia Predefined Profiles...""

5) After you finish scanning, scroll down to the Unknown Section and look for the Setting ID ""PRE_D3D9_COMPATIBILITY_BITS"" and set the Value to ""0x00000040 (King's Bounty, X2: Wolverine's Revenge, Independence War 2 - Edge of Chaos, Falcon 4.0 Allied Force, MS Flight Simulator X, Links 2003, Gothic 2, Gothic 1)""

6) Hit apply settings (located to the upper right hand side of the window) and run Sacrifice. 

It worked like a charm for me!"
