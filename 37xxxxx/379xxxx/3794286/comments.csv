,sickonineteen,2007-09-09T23:26Z,This torrent was created so that there is at least one version of the second season of Carnivale available on TPB of which the episodes are in the proper order...
,Suez111111,2007-09-30T17:40Z,Finns det någon som vet något om en tredje säsong? Om ja när kommer den?
,Suez111111,2007-09-30T17:41Z,Is there anyone who knows something about a third season? If yes is it known when it comes?
,Suez111111,2007-09-30T17:46Z,"Found the answer myself... it was a dissapointing NO!

Obviously everything has to come to an end..."
,sickonineteen,2007-10-01T16:29Z,"This is likely to be the final season
That's why I upped this torrent to begin with: it's the final of the series and wherever you try to find the complete series you'll come up with a torrent that has the final two episodes tagged in the wrong order.
And I do mean on any torrent site..

so, I didn't rip or collect these episodes, I just corrected them so that it's not such a suspense killer for those who watched all 23 episodes and would like to enjoy the very last one.  "
,Dataleif,2007-11-12T21:07Z,whats the deal with taking away the release groups name?
,hannchil,2007-11-29T17:48Z,This torrent is only episodes 13-24 :(.
,daviex2259,2008-01-03T12:22Z,This is not missing any eps. Season 1 is eps 1-12 season 2 is eps 13-24. There are only 24 eps total for both seasons.
,Torrent245,2008-03-28T16:15Z,No season 3?
,tzimas,2008-04-24T01:06Z,211 and 212 ARE THE SAME!!!! i cant find the last episode!! plz HELP
,closetpervert,2008-07-25T23:27Z,Danke schön.
,mooveegeek,2009-07-31T00:10Z,This is awesome.  Carnivale was a great show just cut by HBO becuase of budget issues.  too bad no one else picked it up
,-rens-,2010-06-08T14:50Z,"Too bad they only made 2 seasons of Carnivale. Could have done a whole lot more. Nonetheless it doesn't feel rushed. 
Great show, great ending, great quality.
