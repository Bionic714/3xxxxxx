                                 Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dead Tenants follows the journey of the Preternatural Research Society (PRS) ? 
a team of paranormal investigators ? through the attics, basements, living rooms 
and back yards of the most haunted houses in the country. Coming to the aid of 
families experiencing unwanted ghosts and unexplainable activity in their homes, 
PRS is there to help.

Led by occult specialist Deryl Mitzen, the team is composed of renowned psychic 
Jane Doherty (whose bizarre expanding stomach alerts her to the presence of spirits); 
tarot-reading Turkish psychic and ufologist Farah Gore; police detective turned 
ghost-chaser Dave Owens; energy work specialist Susan Pie; historical preservationist 
and researcher Kenny Roginski; psychic healer Kiki Mandalozis; and spiritual intuitive 
Noelle Daidone.

As a team, PRS conducts three-day investigations. The team literally moves into a 
haunted home and lives with the besieged family for a long weekend. Their multi-pronged 
approach weaves the historical, scientific and psychic into a rich tapestry of a modern 
American haunting.

Each episode of this unprecedented reality series culminates in a s√©ance ? a harrowing 
ritual in which dead tenants are evicted. Trapped souls are released, unwanted ghosts are 
cleansed from the home, demons are driven out, and families tormented by that which is 
unseen are at last given peace.
