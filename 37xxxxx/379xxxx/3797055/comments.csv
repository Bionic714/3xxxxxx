Thanks for the upload, but it is not really turn based ;)"

,Piddyx,2008-02-03T22:30Z,Don't download the patch from the start up menu.  Find a mirror or else you will get an annoying error because their servers will time out.
,Raelzak,2008-02-10T20:42Z,"this might seem dumb, but this is my first torrent, is this just the patch? if it's not how do I install the game?"
,mzms,2008-03-29T15:50Z,"i have problems...when the movie start..its run ok...after the movie, the error occur. its state unable to create graphic device. what is that mean"
,Emot11,2008-03-30T23:19Z,"Can't Install it!!!!

Need Help, please!!!"
,boostHungry,2008-06-24T17:41Z,"Great Torrent.  It comes with 3 files, the exe is not the game it's actually an update.  The .bin is the file your looking for, it's an image of the actual CD.  You need to mount that file with a program like PowerISO and then run the setup from your explorer that shows up as a dvd drive.  This runs the installation like normal so you won't run into the problem where you don't have the registry key needed to update or install expansions.  "
,boostHungry,2008-06-25T05:43Z,Game does not seem stable.  My system is built for performance (can run Age of Conan no problem).  I'm crashing to windows which is rather annoying.  The third tutorial will not run.  Are these bugs from the torrent or are these problems with the retail version also?  
,Tukotih,2008-07-01T15:22Z,"If you like the torrent, RATE IT!

Norbus did the -1, Now lets show him we got the upper hand!"
