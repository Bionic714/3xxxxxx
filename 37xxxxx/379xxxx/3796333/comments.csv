,Ruud_van_Dan,2007-09-16T01:10Z,"One of the best uploads I have ever come across. One or two ROMs in there that I didn't even know existed!

I will seed this for as long as such a thing as the internet exists.

Long live the Amiga!"

,Mr__B,2011-04-04T00:41Z,"Tried every kickstart download i can find on TPB. I cant seam to find a 1.3 v34.5 ROM, that works with WHDload. (Possibly due to the fact that every ROM i checked states that they are in fact v34.2, and not v34.5...)
So far i can only say... This sucks. *sighs*
