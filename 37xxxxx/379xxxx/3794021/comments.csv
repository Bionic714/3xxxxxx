,iceCream-NOR-,2007-09-03T16:25Z,is this the real explicit? i hate when songs is sencored
,iceCream-NOR-,2007-09-03T16:41Z,bad qualitiy.. the clean version is better... pure shit
,marantonis,2007-09-03T18:03Z,I think the quality isnt so bad...
,pmj0383,2007-09-03T18:30Z,"quality is fine, but this isn't the real release. It has the 4 released singles and a bunch of mix tape stuff. It looks like its just the clean version on the site now."
,marantonis,2007-09-03T20:50Z,Thats definitely the real songs though. look at the list. 
,pmj0383,2007-09-03T21:51Z,"... the names are right, but listen to the songs. It's not them compare it to the clean version out or compare the featured artists that are suppsed to be on the songs."
