The first minute is an annoying hodgepodge of snippets of the video you're going to see in the next five minutes, overdubbed with loud, distorted electronic drums, so you'll have to turn the volume back up when they're finished making noise.

The 2nd minute includes the lady loudly pretending to be aroused as she settles onto the Sybian -- which, as you know, is hardly necessary.  Then she gets quiet for a few seconds when the machine starts working on her, before she remembers to start faking ""Oh-Yeh"" noises again.

By the 3rd minute, her moans alternate between fake and real, and soon it's obvious that she's going to spend as much time as possible exaggerating.  

It's hard to tell where the faking begins and ends.  In my opinion, since you can't tell when she's for real, she ruined most of it, including the happy ending.  Maybe there was a little orgasm in there -- who knows; who cares."
