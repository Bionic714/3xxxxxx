BioShock is a unique game that mixes a spine-chilling setting illustrated
with art deco art and architecture, sci-fi themes of bio-genetic mutation
and self-modification, a deep storyline with open-choice freedom to interact
with the world as you choose, and first-person action that requires you to
think every time you pull the trigger. After your plane crashes into icy
uncharted waters, you discover a rusted bathysphere and descend into Rapture,
a city hidden beneath the sea. Constructed as an idealistic society for a
hand picked group of scientists, artists and industrialists, the idealism
is no more. Now the city is littered with corpses, wildly powerful
guardians roam the corridors as little girls loot the dead, and genetically
mutated citizens ambush you at every turn.
