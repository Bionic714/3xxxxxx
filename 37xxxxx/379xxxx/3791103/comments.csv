,JonastheMan,2007-09-03T20:33Z,"I've downloaded the torrent and tried to install the game, but when the installation of the game is finished, it automatically starts to look for the newest patch... Then the installer finds out that i do not have the original cd in the cd-rom, and wont fuc**** download the patch!!! And i can't figure out a way to skip the patchdownload....
Can someone please help?

Thanks."
