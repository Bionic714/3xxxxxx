| right...first off, we like to apologize for the long wait. we    |
| understand that some people have been very upset about it. all   |
| we like to say is that the truth is often a bit more complex     |
| than what people make up on forums, and shit happens. anyways,   |
| those that didn't die of accumulated anger...                    |
| welcome to wicked wiikey update!                                 |
|                                                                  |
|  so what's new ?                                                 |
| ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                           |
|  - audiofix fixed o_0                                            |
|  - dual layer support (no bitsetting required)                   |
|  - improved media support (all supported chipsets)               |
|  - full Gamecube regionfree (no-swap/video setup)                |
|  - various "smaller" improvements/fixes                          |
|  - workaround for FW 3.0 gameid limitation                       |
|    (existing wkb 1.2 discs will boot again)                      |
|  - "on the fly" settings for gc games (by holding buttons)       |
|       - toggle audiofix, diskspeed, force NTSC/PAL               |
|                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Full GC Regionfree                                              |
| ---------------------                                            |
| Boots GC imports directly using a small apploader hook to setup  |
| the correct video mode. To enable this feature use the new       |
| config disc (1.3). Make sure you also enable the basic region    |
| feature, thats what gets you through the wii menu in the first   |
| place. Unlike a real GC, the NTSC Wii doesnt output PAL50. That  |
| means the game may run but theres no picture. PAL60 games will   |
| work, however you need to enable it. The common way to bring up  |
| the "use PAL60?" dialog on a game is to hold B while booting.    |
| Forcing to NTSC may work as well. PAL consoles output NTSC just  |
| fine.                                                            |
