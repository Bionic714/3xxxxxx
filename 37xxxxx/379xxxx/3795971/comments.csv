,znabela,2007-09-05T20:14Z,"[08-09-03] Wiikey update 1.9b

A leaked version of the wiikey firmware update is available on several websites. While the leaked firmware is indeed working and has all of the announced features, it has not yet been fully tested and does not come with the configuration and recovery discs. A full version will be available from wiikey.cn very soon."
