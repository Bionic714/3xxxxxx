,fish_fingers,2008-10-15T05:15Z,What is with all the douchey self-help books? People actually read this stuff?
,what6733,2008-10-21T06:00Z,"@ fish_fingers

pfffffff I know that you wouldn't catch me ever reading one of these books! No siree.

I do however listen to them as it is much more time effective. Enjoy your worthless life and time wasting."
,blumppin12,2008-10-30T17:41Z,"fish_fingers:

Well, Self help books really help people to get the results faster than they can without any help. This torrent is absolutely fantastic! Just download this audio book and folllow all the methods....who knows, if you apply all the principles presented herein, this could change your life for good....!"
,zackary87kr,2009-01-21T02:11Z,"fish_fingers, it appears to me that you're one of those people who are living life ""in quiet desperation"".  You might be skeptical of Robbins' ideas, but just by you commenting here, shows that you're hungrier for a better life than you have now and you feel lost. 
Listen to what Robbins has to say. Take what is useful and use it. But the choice is ultimately yours."
,SGAK,2009-02-03T01:31Z,"I've listened to Robbins. I've read his stuff. 

And my conclusion is: 
He is full of shit, and anyone who buys that crap, must be mentally weak and could just as easily have turned to religion or any other mental imprisonment. 

Don't take my word for it - look at the kinds of people that are gullable enough to think their life needs ""self-help"" books (written by the only self help - person involved; the guy getting the wads of cash from his big flock of powerless sheep)"
,femforfem4fun,2009-04-17T04:31Z,"Sir,
These principles not only work, they originate from The Law of Success, published by Napoleon Hill, in 1928- There is a ""New"" addition audio book (2001) of the Law of Success available on PB. Hill was funded for 5 years by A. Carnegie to study and write about what successful people do vs. ""other"" people. BTW, success is much more than money. ANY, ""self-help book I have ever seen, read or heard, is originated from the Law of Success. Do they work? Yes. You however have to make distinctions from Oprah crap and the real thing- Like the guy said in the opening scene of Bladerunner - Is this the test?
A. Robbins, does a good job translating success techniques, however, there are better (faster) translations and get used to using your mind, re. Hypnosis, Concentration, Visuulization- Sam Snead said, ""If you aren't thinking about p***y, you just aren't concentrating hard enough"". Finally, get ready to find out not only how wrong you have been forever, but how 98 % of people are morons-sheeple-Can you handle the truth?"
,powerlove,2010-01-24T00:33Z,Excellent Torrent - worth listening to!
,joyfreak,2010-01-24T08:53Z,Thanks a bunch! Peach and Love

If you guys have the answers, this is all a waste of time.  But you don't have the answers, and you eitehr don't know it, or you are beng hypocritical.  This stuff isn't religion, and that's what makes it such a helpful thing to have around in the absence of wise extended family members etc..  I have three kids, a business, and am 44 years old.  I'm still learning, ad Robbins, and Brian tracy,nd Stepehn Covey are gold to listen to.

So pull another bong, SGAK and Fishfingers, while we download, learn, and move right on.

Au revoir, dickheads.

,danconia3873,2010-09-29T00:14Z,"Don't be surprised when two weeks after reading or listening to this crap you still haven't improved your life at all.

Anthony Robbins is a joke."
,kludge420,2010-10-11T19:29Z,"@fish_fingers

There's nothing wrong with being and thinking positively as long as you back it up with action. No self-made person doesn't have an unrealistically positive attitude about their own success; not to mention a huge heaping helping of narcissism. That's not as bad as it sounds you have to have unrealistic expectations if you want to do more than what is expected.

The problem comes when people think all you have to do is think positively like in the case of ""The Secret."" When they just use magic thinking, ""If I wish for it hard enough the universe will hear me and give me everything I want."" without any hard work. There is not one self-made person on the face of the planet that hasn't worked their fingers to the bone to be a success. 

Almost as big an issue is when people equate success with cash and forget about balance, they forget about true happiness. They think appeasing their greed will fill that hole in their lives, that money will make them happy, when of course it won't.

Good luck to you.

Here's all you need to know to be successful and happy: let go of your fear, be brutally honest with yourself, believe you can succeed, work your ass off to get it, but most of all find the balance in all things. That's it."
,kludge420,2010-10-11T19:38Z,"P.S. You also have to be able to spot the roses in the piles of bullshit. For instance hypnosis is utter bullshit. If anything says it can help you without you doing any actual work you can put that in the bullshit pile until it is proven otherwise. In fact you should be skeptical about everything. Just because you have a positive attitude doesn't mean you have to believe every line of bullshit spouted by the overwhelming number of charlatans and snake oil salesmen that are just selling the dream and not any actual tools to help you get there.

Again, it takes a lot of hard work too. Having a positive attitude is a social and mental tool. If you honestly believe you can succeed you'll try harder and if you have a positive attitude people will like you better and it will open more doors. Nothing magical about that, but you still have to make the sale."
,DzKvakic,2010-11-17T23:45Z,I agree with fish_fingers.. every other audio book on top 100 is a freaking self help book... what happened to writing good novels??
,iprattle,2010-11-25T18:22Z,"@DzKvakic  You said ""I agree with fish_fingers.. every other audio book on top 100 is a freaking self help book... what happened to writing good novels??""

Answer: My guess is... the same thing that happened to _reading_ good novels. "
,WideStance,2010-12-10T03:52Z,"First of all: this is NOT the ""Full Audio Book"" described in the title. It's about three chapters out of the book and sadly, it's mostly boring stuff. (He decides to show off by talking about riding around in his fancy helicopter.). If you want the knowledge that's in the book, go to the library and READ THE BOOK.

Second of all: this book fucking sucks. GET OVER IT. There are tons of self-help books on TPB as well as in your local library. Choose something else and don't waste your time with this shit garbage book. Tony Robbins can kiss my asshole."
,kissing_hitler,2011-01-16T23:59Z,Im naked at this precise moment.
,njogu,2011-01-26T08:48Z,"Not everything that people need to know for them to lead fulfilling lives is taught in school. Everything that we know was probably learnt from somewhere school, college, magazines, friends, parents etc. Good self-help tools provide a different but very valuable kind of education (even tho some are plain crap). Self help is not magic you need to apply what u've learned to benefit. 
People who dismiss self-help are blind to many of their personal shortcomings (as evident in some of the ""Im-a-very-tough-guy"" comments here), but who am I to judge? 
Nwayz, fish_fingers n fellow critics Im just wondering how you got to this page... stop pretending self-help junkies!!"
,eklektic,2011-01-31T03:12Z,It's pretty pointless to sit around and post adversely about audio books. They work for some folks. For others no. Personally i wouldn't knock a person trying to be better at anything in life. It beats the hell out wasting time posting negative messages on Piratebay.org #smh
,blackinkgeorge,2011-03-06T03:27Z,"thank you, your efforts are greatly appreciated."
,IndridC0ld,2011-03-18T17:18Z,All of Tony Robin's books are simply manifestations of his attempt to deal with an embarrassingly small penis coupled with a pair of undescended testicles.
,ashen77,2011-04-02T02:08Z,sigh... if you spend a month listening to these types of audio books and learn just one thing. Then you've spent your time wisely. If you dont like these types of books... FUCK OFF and stop looking at em on TPB.
,luxlucis,2011-08-11T20:06Z,"If Anthony Robbins is full of crap and a joke, then why is he rich, successful, and so well thought of and endorsed by other successful people?  Could it be that he knows what he is talking about and it works? To those that bash him: How happy, fulfilled, and successful are you? Something tells me not very much.  Have any of you actually read,studied, and applied his teachings to you own life?  I doubt you have. To say he simply makes money off of desperate, gullible people, is a cop out statement.  Its amazing how many truly pathetic human beings can only get any amount of self worth by bashing other people because secretly they are so envious and jealous of them. If Tony Robbins is full of crap, then what is YOUR secret to happiness and success? You have none. "
,exbrit88,2012-06-11T01:40Z,it sounds like there is a lot of penis envy when it come to tony robbins... just get over it already...
,offlabeluse2,2012-08-09T17:52Z,"Tony Robbins molests children. That is the hidden message in all his talks. Also, he eats his own earwax."
