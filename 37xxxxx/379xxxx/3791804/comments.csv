,P0w3rp0t1,2008-11-23T13:13Z,hi thanks for this but can i ask why didn't you compress it??
,Jasper77,2008-12-13T23:00Z,what do you mean P0w3rp0t1?
,to6y,2008-12-31T15:24Z,"he means why didnt the uploader put it into a rar file. Therefore compressing it, which makes the file a hell of a lot smaller. I agree, all files should be compressed for faster download times, although this is a pretty small file anyways. :D"
,dlectro,2010-08-22T00:01Z,"Using RAR in a torrent is stupid! It doesn't make it a hell of a lot smaller, and the time you might gain in download (seconds), you surely lose when unRARing (minutes).
RAR is useful for example when you upload a soundtrack or any multi-file album to a file hosting site.
But since a torrent is already a compilation of files and pieces, RAR is a bad idea."
