,njet_seed,2008-01-10T02:13Z,"Omg, i really think this is bad, the look of the characters doesn't fit or anything. I think the Lord of the rings Animated is a bit silly in some aspects, though not really bad, but this is much, much worse..!

Still, interesting to see, and everybody doesn't have the same tastes as I. I haven't seen the full one yet, and I guess it also could get you a better understanding of the story, than the Jackson version sometimes does. Anyway that's the case with the first animated part. Thanks for shareing!"
,kingadrock,2009-03-30T07:51Z,"If this is ""Part 2"" of anything, it's a sequel to The Hobbit. Rankin/Bass put out ""The Hobbit"" in 1977, Bakshi did ""The Lord of the Rings"" in 1978. It was supposed to be ""Lord of the Rings Part One"" but the studios squashed ""Part One"" from the name and then refused to do a sequel, despite the fact the movie made money. Then Rankin/Bass did ""The Return of the King"" in 1980. The two are NOT connected, and hence ""The Return of the King"" doesn't mesh exactly with Bakshi's work. 

If one is going to bitch, IMHO you should complain that Bakshi movie sucked, and Rankin/Bass should have done the whole story. That would have been amazing."
