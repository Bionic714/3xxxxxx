And here we have part 2 of the Lord of the rings animated version.
This one was made 2 years after the first part, so this animation is drawn in another way... The characters doesnt look exactly like in part 1. Personally i think part 1 is drawn better. But i hope you enjoy this second and last part of the animated films about The lord of the rings.
