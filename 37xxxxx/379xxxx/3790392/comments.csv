,Torpor,2007-09-02T20:23Z,Thnx a superbunch!!! At last I can see this one in quality!!! Very much appreciated!!! For those of you that haven't seen S. Wright and likes good stand up or just wicked good humour this is awsome stuff!!!
,agge1977,2007-09-03T06:05Z,yes baby! love it!
,Torpor,2007-09-03T12:45Z,The sound seems to be a bit out of sync! :o/
,gvgreg,2007-09-17T06:01Z,"Unfortunately, the sound was not only out of sync but there were numerous audio drop outs; with Steven Wright's one-liner style, it made the video unwatchable."
,LeechBot2,2007-10-09T19:18Z,"Right, it's out of sync, which wouldn't matter, but the audio dropouts make it impossible to enjoy this video. Don't waste your time with this one like I did."
,justgeoff,2007-11-30T03:51Z,"I agree with the above comments the audio is no good, you don't hear the whole joke which defeats the purpose."
,brentvan,2008-01-23T08:16Z,maybe people have better luck than i do but i'd say don't download it.  the audio is all fucked up and you can't hear any of his jokes
,eterna111,2008-02-20T05:58Z,"The others are right - this one is fucked because the audio skips all the time. A shame, really...

Can anyone rip/upload a working file? "
,macchiato,2008-04-03T21:15Z,"Jittery sound, too bad."
,DiddyMaC,2008-07-10T18:57Z,Unwatchable. Don't waste your time.
,hfzsg,2008-10-13T06:49Z,"Utterly unwatchable.

Did you even WATCH the first 5 minutes before you uploaded it?
I don't know HOW someone could fuck up a simple XviD encode this much, but I gotta hand it to you...this is one of the worst encoding jobs I have EVER seen. 

Here is 5 things that shoot out as being wrong here.

1. Bad Crop
2. Interlaced (Hard to tell with quality so low)
3. File size 4x to large for quality
4. Completely fucktarded resolution
5. Interleaved incorrectly ruining every single joke

You suck at fucking encoding, please make no further attempts. Please end your worthless life ASAP."
,schrade,2008-12-15T08:33Z,Audio is fucked.
,mathx,2009-03-05T15:19Z,"y, I downloaded this aswell and every joke is ruined like already mentioned. cuz sound beein cut out in places so the perfectly match to fuck up the joke.
"
,badbod,2009-04-28T18:06Z,this is intentionally fucked as audio and video are both 'cut' to match.  FAKE!!!!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.
,nightsongz2,2009-05-02T01:40Z,"Here is a perfect rip of this:
