Trivia:The title comes from a joke that does not appear in this special: \"This next song is called \'We\'ll Find Her When the Leaves Blow Away, Because I\'m Not Raking Until Spring.\'\" Wright later felt the joke was too dark and removed it but the title remained. more

Either you love Steven Wright\'s dry on-liner humor told in his trademark deadpan delivery, or you don\'t. I\'m definitely in the former category. So sadly haven missed this special when it was on cable, I was over-enthusiastic to get it when it came out on DVD earlier this week. Some of the material almost had me in tears. Not sad tears, mind you. I heard some repeated variations off his older material (the dream movie bit), but for the most part it\'s new material (to me anyways). So yeah, I enjoyed it very much. If you want a good laugh, rent/buy this one now. Also as an added bonus you get his short film \"One Soldier\" and small clips of one of his shows in \'88


Enjoy! :)
