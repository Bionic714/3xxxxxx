,stufro,2007-09-05T04:47Z,"is this supposed to work on PC/laptop because i did what you instructed and the activation box still comes up. Tips please thanks,"
,Garmac,2007-09-05T14:34Z,it should but try this: Don't install the non cracked. (remove it). Just installed the cracked application and copy the inav iguidance folder from the root of the DVD image to the root of your C drive and see if that works...
,stufro,2007-09-06T07:34Z,"Thanks for the tip, works like a charm..."
,pbbem,2007-09-07T21:07Z,"Runs fine on the PC, but can not make it function on the PPC, though 3.1 did. Errors re speech and map files... Any solutions?"
,Garmac,2007-09-08T05:32Z,"not sure, sorry I only use it on PC. Check the torrent comment on D*e*m*o*n*o*i*d*.com. It should be the ""fracture"" version..."

,Newb787,2007-09-16T06:40Z,Need clearer instructions.  
,Newb787,2007-09-16T06:41Z,Will the app from other sites not work?  How do u install if u r copying directory?
,Newb787,2007-09-16T06:42Z,"In otherwords, this makes no sense: ""Just installed the cracked application and copy the inav iguidance folder from the root of the DVD image to the root of your C drive and see if that work"""
,Newb787,2007-09-16T06:43Z,The only cracked app is this 15.26 mb download.  Not the 1.+ GB file.
,Newb787,2007-09-16T06:43Z,"So someone pls explain,  we need a readme file."
,ze12o,2007-09-26T20:59Z,"Alright.. everyone that can't get this to work heres what you do. Uninstall the original iG 4 when it ask if you want to restart click no. Run the setup from the unziped crack file and it should look like you're reinstalling it after it is done you should be able to open iG. Restart the computer. right click your dvd-rom and select explore. Drag the ""iNav iGuidance"" folder into the root of your c drive(root meaning click my computer>local disk C) and open iG after and see if it works. If it does thank me if it doesn't >shrugs"
,VanyK,2007-09-30T19:44Z,"Download the image from mininova and download this crack

open the image from mininova using powerISO

replace the setup folder with the cracked setup folder

install as normal and drag the inav iguidance folder onto your C drive for PC GPS installs or into the root of your SD card for PDA installs

Finished."
,nene4860,2007-10-03T05:41Z,Thanks Garmac for the crack and to Vanyk for the detailed setup explanation. Works perfect on my Dell Axim with WM5.
,fbskiracer,2007-11-29T16:38Z,"I still can't get this to work, but I need to try the DVD install instead of just extracting the iso.  Anyone want to offer some more advice?"
,Newb787,2007-12-05T00:11Z,Thanks ze12o.  It works now.  I Appreciate the explanation! 
,Newb787,2007-12-05T00:14Z,"fbskiracer, i suggest downloading iguidance 3+ and then use version 4 and apply the crack.  Also, you can download Alcohol iso as well. somebody posted even more details on demonoid (from what I was told) but the site is now dead."
,Newb787,2007-12-16T06:22Z,Just an FYI.  I started playing with IG 4 quite a bit and it seems to be unstable and tends to crash when panning with this hack.
,LastDon6585,2008-06-23T17:08Z,where did you get iGuidance 4? can't find ANY torrents anywhere.
,Garmac,2009-11-08T14:35Z,try on isohunt dot com
,KunfusedOne,2011-08-02T00:56Z,Anyone know how to remove the cracked license so one can install a newer bought version?
