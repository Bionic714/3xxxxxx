The feature tells the story of NASAs Mars Rover mission, which saw the construction of two incredibly complex robotic vehicles named Spirit and Opportunity and sent them to the surface of Mars, where they landed successfully in the summer of 2003. There is extensive footage of the surface of Mars, where both carefully accurate CGI and actual Rover footage, is used to give the viewer a nice visit to another world. Amazingly, the planned mission of 90 days has now gone on for over four years and continues to this day.
