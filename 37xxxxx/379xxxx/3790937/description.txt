Game Of Death II aka Tower Of Death (Bruce Lee, 1981) - REMASTERED

HKFlix Says:  	3.5 Stars

One that's "so bad it's good", this is a Bruce Lee flick with hardly any Bruce Lee in it. And the great Yuen Wo Ping action choreography is all but lost on these performers. Nonetheless, this films a lot of fun, and is highly recommended for cheese-lovers!
