This torrent represents a work of LOVE. All texts so far gathered,
as well as all future gatherings aim at exposing interested students to occult information.

Future releases will include submissions from users like YOU.

For some of us, the time has come to mobilize. If you have an interest in
assisting in this process - we all have strengths to bring to the table - please email occult.digital.mobilization AT gmail DOT com

Complacency serves the old gods.
