[V],Subzero!,2007-09-04T15:48Z,"@gamelover25

using UTorrent 1.7.2 in combination with PeerGuardian2 (http://jfm.methlabs.org)

this is the way to get faster downloads, the trick is to have pg2 running in the background, pg2 -blocks billions of ip's, thats why downloads are up to 100 % faster!, iam downloading torrents sometime with 800+ kb/s... when iam leeching the same torrent without pg2 running iam at max. of  100 kb/s... my tip FOR ALL, get 
PeerGuardian2... and be happier!

Subster"
[T],ale4,2007-09-06T23:38Z,sorry but my up is 30Kb/s
,kakkakokkare,2007-09-17T15:14Z,"the whole game is in russian, maybe worth playing if one could understand russian."
,hayton2k3,2007-09-19T12:04Z,"hi i got this and if you pick german language it is easier to understand,as its almost englise,but does anyone know which is the language file?as it is vice city and i will swap language files with vice city so its english and i will upload the english file for you all email me hayton2k3@hotmail.com as i wont check this"
,Evil Bastardo,2007-09-21T02:22Z,"I downloaded this game (which I am Seeding the Heck Out of), and I totally Love it. So far. 
It started out a little complicated since the text is all in Russian. But I hope this will
help out us English and American Speaking People.
I was messing around in the options menu and I found the Language setup. 
After the GTA Vice City Intro Movie, Menus go as follows:

  1st Menu:      Start Menu:       Options Menu:
Start Game    New Game         Controller Setup
  Options        Load Game           Audio Setup
Quit Game      Delete Game        Video Setup
                        Exit                Language Setup
                                           Player Skin Setup
                                                 Exit

Controller Setup Menu:
Standard or Classic Keyboard
Button Mapping
Mouse Setup
   Exit

The controller seems to be set up similar to the playstation 2 version, but computer
controllers may be mapped different.
Anyway, With this you should be able to get farther in to find a language you can
comprehend."

what are you supossed to do in like the first level.....i can kind of read it but i don't get what i am supossed to do

:(

can you help?"
,lissatyler,2008-10-10T01:31Z,"ok i figured it out.....this is how to turn it to English, what you do is you copy the Audio files from the original Vice city and you paste it in the GTA Underground 2 folder and you overright it and the you copy the (Mss32.dll) into the same folder and then you copy the text folder and the txd but not the data folder you'll be all set......but the only way it works is if you run the vice city EXE. not GTA Underground exe. so there you go"
