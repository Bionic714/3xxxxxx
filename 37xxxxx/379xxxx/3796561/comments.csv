,Flyfisher61,2007-09-08T00:58Z,"Thanks! The show was originally recorded by BBC on nov 2, 1979 at Hammersmith Odeon, London. This recording is incomplete and the missing songs are: Sin City, Bad Boy Boogie, The Jack, Whole Lotta Rosie and Rocker. The opening song of the concert is misplaced - Live Wire (as track 9 but should be track 2). "

Yes, I know, I wish they had aired the whole show, would have been great to have Sin City there!"
