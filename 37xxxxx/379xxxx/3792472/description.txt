Well this is a transcoded version of the SYS release from a few days ago.  I made this so it would play on my Divx DVD player.  I also included the soundtrack as all of the ones I came across sucked.  I tried to keep the quality as close to the original as i could, but this was my first try at converting video to another format, well enjoy the movie everyone.  I will seed this at my full bandwidth as well, which is 100 mbit upstream.
