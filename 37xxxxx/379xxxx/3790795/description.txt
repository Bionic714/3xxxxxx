Gun Warrior is a fast-paced 3D Shooter game that takes place in the harsh
and brutal world of the Wild West. In the course of your violent journey, 
you will encounter (and defeat) literally hundreds of enemies both on the 
road and in classic, high-noon-style duel shoot-outs. Gun Warrior is more
than just a mission-based shooter. The additional game mode is the 
Gunfighter's Tournament where you can test your skills against the most 
feared gunmen of all the Wild West. You are, after all, one of them: The
main player character is Cole Tilghman, whose name was feared or revered 
all over the Great Frontier of the Wild West era.
