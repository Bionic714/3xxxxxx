,Ashmadeus,2007-09-06T15:29Z,"Cheers Deviantos, I will keep seeding this for a while when finished."
,Deviantos,2007-09-06T15:30Z,"To support the raising of Karelian question and support in peacefull returning of karelia as part of Finland as depicted in Peace of Tartu ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tartu_%28Russian%E2%80%93Finnish%29 ), please sign this plea. ( http://www.adressit.com/karjala_takaisin ) It explains in short how to add your name and sites where you can find more info regarding this issue. This is in no means radical movement or such, merely a demonstration of will to solve this issue once and for all."

this one you should not miss for a reality check.

most people has no idea what was going on between one soviet superpower and some small amount of finns.

check this out."
,lee-san,2007-09-18T06:18Z,ok i seed abuut 40kbps but.. hell
,lee-san,2007-09-18T06:30Z,"and another one....

Does anyone know the older documentary of the Winter War aka Talvisota?

It was BBC or some other british major TV doc. 3-4 years old doc. Mostly black & white.

If anyone has a copy please up I will seed.

Has more live footage than this american re-demonstration..."
,Deviantos,2007-10-01T21:17Z,"Yes it was, very bloody war and amazingly, Finland survived with 1/10 of casualties compared to Soviet Union."
,Butt,2007-11-16T22:56Z,"The Soviets lost between 800,000-1,000,000 men,
that equals 1/27 - 1/33 .. not 1/10 as you say ;)"
,Deviantos,2007-11-20T04:39Z,"Heh, yeah, but I meant at least 1/10, as the number is not certain. Just like with the Stalins political cleans, it is estimated that there could be even 50 million victims instead of 15 - 25 million."
,ddiha,2008-02-05T17:32Z,"Thx mate, been looking for this one for awhile"
,jafu,2008-05-06T02:23Z,Anyone still seeding?
,romanov1918,2008-07-13T17:26Z,"thank you, I can't wait to watch this"
,Gnulle,2009-02-06T09:18Z,"For dere Nordmenn som forherliger deres patetiske krigsinnsats og tilber speiderguttene Max Manus og ""Kjakan"" Sønsteby se på dette. Slik som dette forsvarer ett folk og dens regjering sitt land. "
,Gnulle,2009-02-06T09:20Z,"Can anyone suggest other documentaries or movies on the Finnish Winter War? I have watched Talvisota and Ihantala-Tali. Good movies, Ihantala-Tali doesn´t really get under the skin of the soldier. How about books? "
,Ichneumon,2009-06-17T21:16Z,"If you're interested in a book, William R. Trotter's ""Frozen Hell"" is excellent.

As for Soviet casualty figures, ""we lost a million men"" was hyperbole by Khrutschev. The estimates for dead Soviets go from 85,000 to 270,000, and of course loads of starved, maimed and frozen men."
,R2d6.51,2011-05-24T02:54Z,"Leesan this is reference to your inquiry about older version. It's not a doc but a film. Here is the poop on it from IMDB: Cheers r2d6
