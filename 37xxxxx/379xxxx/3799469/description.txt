A "bloody" good movie - accurate, very accurate from my perspective as someone with Italian heritage who migrated to Australia in 1964 . The character and experiences of Nino could've been either of my two uncles who migrated in the mid-1950's.

Notwithstanding the story, it's an amazing photo story of what Australia was like for millions or migrants in the'60's - particularly the larger cities of Sydney and Melbourne. The character of the Aussies is spot on - you can meet them any day on any street in any city of Australia right now. The aussie "mateship" unique to the Australian psyche is very well portrayed; the Aussie mentality of always willing to give a bloke a fair go and taking people for what they are - fair dinkum - and not who they are is also well captured. The actors are the creme de la creme of Australian theatre, tv, radio and film - most of them appearing in many Australian dramas of later years such as Homicide, Division 4, Number 96, Prisoner, Skippy(Ed Devereaux & Tony Bonner), and Crocodile Dundee (John Meillon)

It's a refreshing retro to an era of quality storylines, acting and the promotion of individual potential. The language, the 6 o'clock closings of the pubs, the white aussie's prejudice to the 'Eye-tie"(ITalian) and anyone else who wasn't a Smith, Brown, McKenzie, O'Farrell is as accurate as I experienced. And all served up with a laugh.

Along with the book, the film provides a timeless piece of well recommended entertainment and history.
