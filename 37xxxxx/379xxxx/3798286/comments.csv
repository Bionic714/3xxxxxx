I usually prefer English subtitles with foreign movies, but as this is anime I'm happy to watch with the English dub. The beauty of this copy is that I can watch it the way I described, or watch it with the original Japanese language and download the English subtitles seperately if I wish to watch and read the subtitles."
,Swanee1,2012-01-09T23:20Z,"It should be added that while this is still the Japanese Animated movie, it is the Disney release, which means the dubbing is very professionally done."
,nitzors,2012-01-29T02:58Z,"I would like to point out that this isn't dual audio. It does not give me the option to switch between Japanese and English at all. I'm using MPC-HC, and I've used dual audio before so I know the problem's not on my end."
,indiaman,2012-01-29T06:56Z,Thanks for this wonderful movie.
,Mae7886,2012-03-21T09:17Z,I've seen this movie many times with subtitles and the dubbing on this is soooo far off. There is nothing that is like any of the real characters. 
,MaxKohler,2012-07-07T14:58Z,"Ok. Some of the comments on this are quite confusing so I'd just like to clear it up for people.

It IS dual audio. I'm using VLC and you just right click -> audio -> audio track. They both say ""english"" but if you choose the 2nd option it's in the original japanese.

The first audio track is the professionally done english version made by disney. Disney's audio versions of the studio ghibli films do have a different ""emotional feel?"" to them, and personally I prefer the japanese audio with english subtitles for all the films.

You can choose either one with this torrent but you will have to download the english subtitle as it's not included.

This version which I also got from TPB Whisper.Of.The.Heart.1995.480p.BluRay.x264-mSD.mkv contains the japanese audio and english subtitles and is less blurry + smaller file size."
