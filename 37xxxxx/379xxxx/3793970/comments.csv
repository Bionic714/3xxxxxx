,schlangemann,2008-06-23T00:07Z,"sprayper, don't pay any of these fuckers anything for a crack or a code, because all they do is use your device ID to enter into a keygen and generate a map unlock code specific to your device.  Search PB for a garmin keygen by Jetmouse (latest version is 1.3) and that's all you need to generate the map and device unlock codes based on your unit's device ID.  Fuck them extortionists who want to get paid to use a product developed by somebody else who intended it to be public domain.  I have no respect for crooks."

He is from south africa what do you expect?  THEY are all like that... ya you know what I am talking about marktman1.  Just look in a mirror.  Trying to make money off people for stolen software is WORSE then the jerks who are asking too much for it in the first place.  Its too bad AIDS didn't finish off you people.

If you plan on paying for unlock codes buy them from garmin, if not there are plenty of free keygens out there, use one of those.  Don't pay this pile of shit a dime.
