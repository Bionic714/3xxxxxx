To answer your question from somewhere else, I do not like all the files put in one archive AT ALL. So I don't like things like ""Rammstein.rar"" either. Why don't people add all the files to a torrent, so that everybody can see what's inside, maybe DL only some of the files,  or in general spot potential fakes. The more info you provide, the better and reliable. In this case, I wonder how many songs are in your RAR archive, what bitrate, and whether it is possible to fit ALL THE ALBUMS made by Rammstein so far into 160 MiB, if you know what I mean.

Cheers"
