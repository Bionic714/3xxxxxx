This is the best uncensored patch I have ever found for The Punisher. This is all you need to play The Punisher totally uncensored and uncut. All the other patches I have found are crap. None of the other "No Black & White" patches works really well.

There are two patches, one for the US version and the other one for the UK/European version. If you are not sure witch version you have then here is a guide how to check it:

Open The Punisher 'Data' folder, usually "C:Program FilesTHQMarvelThe Punisherdvd_pcdata". Check the size of the 'table.vpp' file. The US game file is 5.79 MB (5,930 KB) and the UK/European game file is 5.91 MB (6,062 KB).

When you have installed the patch start the game with "The Punisher - No Black & White fÃ¼r (US/EV).exe" in your game folder. The patch is in German language but simply click on the white skull in the appearing window to star the game.

This patch includes:
More Gore Pack
Camera Hack
No Black & White
Cracked exe

For those of you who did not know The Punisher originally received an AO rating from the ESRB for Blood and Gore. The creators had to censor the game to receive an M rating. This patch is made to make it able to play the game as it was originally meant to be.
