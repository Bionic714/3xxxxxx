mcreasy, I don't know that I would want to dl this torrent but the way it usually works is that you post the torrent and the seed for some time allowing others the opportunity to seed. Pretty simple, really.

You have to wait for others to download and seed. Alot of people shut it down when its finished. At least seed 1.5 ratio. Thats my rule. If i like it alot, i do seed for 6.5 or +. It was uploaded 2 of sept. it cannot be possible for seeds to be like 200 or something. Exept for aXXo's torrents.

Learn the concept of seeds and leeches! 

mcreasy is doing a fine job! "
