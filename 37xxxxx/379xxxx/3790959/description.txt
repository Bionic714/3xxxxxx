Based on the true story of the Danish woman Karen Blixen (Meryl Streep), who marries a friend for the title of Baroness and they move to Africa and start a coffee plantation. Things unfold when her Swedish husband, Bror Blixen (Klaus Maria Brandauer) begins cheating on her and is away on business often, so she's at home alone, working on the farm and bonding with two men she met in her first day in Africa. She eventually falls in love with the one, Denys Finch-Hatton (Robert Redford) and goes on safari and whatnot with him. Later, she begins to want more from him than the simple friendship/relationship they have and pushes marriage, but Denys still wants his freedom. By the end, she's gained a much better understanding and respect for the African culture than when she came. Won 7 Oscars.
