,algorithm345,2007-09-01T08:19Z,"Incase that wasn't clear, if you did get files from my previous torrent, do-not-copy those 6 files listed here, as they were the ones invloved in the mysterous size-change that prevented me continuing seeding

the other ones should all be fine though"
,MagiciansFR,2007-09-02T16:27Z,"Would you happen to have A Clash of Swords read by Roy Dotrice? I've got it read by somebody else but if Roy read it I'd much prefer that one. For any of you who have not heard Roy Dotrice read a fantasy book, youre in for a real treat. The guy has a wonderful voice and can sound like a dozen completely different people and sounds great as each of them."
,algorithm345,2007-09-02T22:55Z,"Roy Dotrice does an excellent job of reading A Game of Thrones, I do own the other two books read by him, A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords, (I did not buy A Feast for Crows after I heard the dull, boring sample of the replacement reader).

I did do this exact same thing with the three audio books about a year back, but at the time I compressed them into mp3 format that is such poor quality, whilst only being about half the size of the files in this download anyway. As far as my hearing can tell, the files in this download sound no poorer than listening straight off the tape.

I'll eventually rerecord and convert the others but as they continue to get larger, and the first book took long enough, it may be some time."
,kenzeitak,2007-09-11T10:02Z,More seeding please! Cant find this book in my closest libraries so I'm really grateful =)
,algorithm345,2007-09-11T12:48Z,"I'll be back in a few days if seeders are still needed, I have a terribly slow upload speed, but I can at least help with any missing or rare pieces :)"
,arahi,2007-10-10T01:27Z,"i'm a huge fan of this series. i have all the books which i downloaded from audible, but they are in .aa format which has drm, otherwise i would upload them.  if you will reseed this, i will seed it for 1 month."
,meccs,2008-07-06T16:30Z,"Thank you so much for this release! The quality is fantastic! I can't listen to those 16kbps files!

Can you PLEASE upload the other books too?!"
,algorithm345,2008-07-11T11:37Z,"Hi there, I do have the next one ready, but I haven't had a chance to listen through it, thus I can't be sure there isn't the odd glitch etc, I will however, upload it shortly and will link to it from here"

Book 2 "
,meccs,2008-07-15T12:49Z,"Wow! Thanks! But what do you mean with ""the odd glitch""?"
,algorithm345,2008-07-19T15:18Z,"When I transfer it from tape sometimes it will have a little hiccup and the sound will not transfer properly, so i.e. instead of speaking there will be a little squeek for a second, When I've come accross them it's usually just for a second or two, I just go back and redo those tapes, but it's hard to find them >_"
,tpbusername01,2008-10-04T19:16Z,Great quality. Perfect rip. Very good book. Thanks algorithm
,PenniesOS,2009-06-28T15:17Z,"Even though this one is kinda slow in downloading, i'm keeping on as the combo of a non-16k rip + correct tags = the only way to listen to this.

Cheers."
,Scazza,2010-04-09T21:57Z,Thanks everyone for seeding!! You are great!
,9ki,2010-08-09T15:07Z,"stuck at 97,2% TT"
,djavlepik,2011-04-05T02:57Z,"Fair warning: Though all the files appear to be here, several of the chapters are named incorrectly and out of order."
,tal77,2011-04-12T01:08Z,"@djavlepik

Care to elaborate which chapters?"
,tbrandle,2011-05-14T10:15Z,these are completely out of order..would someone please write the correct chapter order so we can enjoy this?
,xoferbean,2011-06-07T21:41Z,"I don't understand what you are saying. I've downloaded 97.2% of it and it has stopped, the files that haven't downloaded are the files that you have listed...

47 - Eddard
48 - Jon
49 - Eddard
51 - Sansa
52 - Jon
53 - Bran

But you're saying that this torrent has those files and it's the other one you uploaded that didn't work. Seems like this one has the same problem as the last one. 

And is this out of order then or what? Some people say it is as well as being named incorrectly. Being a bit more specific would be nice.
Thanks"
,Powdercake,2012-07-10T06:35Z,"The people who posted that the chapters are out of order are wrong.

I just went through with my copy of the book and every chapter is in the correct order and labeled correctly."
