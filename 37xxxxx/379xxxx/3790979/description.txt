"Death By Misadventure" goes in depth behind the scenes as we unfold the greatest mystery of the martial arts movie world. It also highlights a profile of Bruce Lee's legacy, Brandon Lee, which charts the rising star's emergence as a major force in action cinema of the '90s until his tragic and untimely death in March 1993.
