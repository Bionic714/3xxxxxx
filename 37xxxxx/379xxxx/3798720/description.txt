 provides you with

something you shouldnt 

play, when youre not 18!


..::  Dreamforge Interactive's  ***SANITARIUM***  -.direct.play.rip.- ::..



:. ripped .:

some vids, logos, ... and it has been fixed for newer systems!.

 

:. about .:

Broken into eight chapters, the entire game is a journey through
your own madness to potential salvation.

Sanitarium is one of the better adventure games released in recent years. 

The game's storyline is entertaining start to finish, beginning with a classic 
man with amnesia wakes up in an asylum' opening, and getting more and 
more strange as the game wears on.

Across the game's nine acts (spread across three CD-ROMs), you'll slowly learn
more about the circumstances of your amnesia and the strange world of madness 
into which you have descended, with bits of the plot being unveiled in dialogue and 
fragmentary flashbacks that are spaced out fairly well.

The graphics, both on the screen and in the cut scenes, are of high quality, with a lot
of care taken in illustrating the strange and bizarre worlds included in Sanitarium.

S p e c i a l   I n f o   N o t e :

Some virus-scanner recognize the header of a packed exe ( SaniStart.exe )

as a lame virus, (coz it's thebyte by byte check error of 'em!.) 

Its almost certainly a false positive alert from overly protective heuristics

you can read more about in your VirusTool-Manual or VirusTools-WebSite!.

(heuristics). thank you for reading!.
