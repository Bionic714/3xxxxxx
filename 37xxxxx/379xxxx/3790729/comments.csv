,bobtentpeg,2007-09-04T03:37Z,"installing Mac OSX Leopard without a Dual Layer DVD

PREP
Have TWO blank partitions ready. One will be for the installer and the other will be where you install Leopard.

LET?S GO

* With your disc image mounted, open the Disk Utility application (Applications -> Utilities).
* Click the Restore tab (see it near the top of the Disk Utility window? Just after First Aid, Erase and RAID?)
* Drag your DMG file from the list on the left of your Disk Utility window to the ?Source? field.
* Then, drag the icon of the partition you want to put the installer on to the ?Destination? field. Again, do this from the left pane of your Disk Utility window. If you try to do this from the desktop (as I kept trying to do) you?re going to drive yourself bonkers.
* Click the ?Erase Destination? check box so that it shows a check.
* I also skipped the Checksum. You might or might not want to do the same. Your call.
* Click Restore.
* Wait until done.

bootcamp wasnt made to work with leopard.
to partition it moves files around the partition your splitting to make a chunk to be split.  It hasnt been setup to work with the leopard file system.

calm down man.  Maybe if you didnt limit your bandwidth you would dl faster.  After about 2 hours i set my upload to 50, and my download suddenly sped up to between 110-200 kb/sec.

Yes you can archive and install. it will save your network preferences and will create a folder called previous version1 then move your apps and application support stuff to the new system.

,srgt,2007-09-08T17:54Z,"Without a disc, the process is slightly more complicated (I'm in the middle of doing it, but I haven't installed it yet). The best way to do it is of course with a dual-layer DVD, but if you have a computer like mine (first gen MacBook Pro), that option is not possible, because I can't burn DL DVDs. So what you need is either an external hard drive, ipod, or enough space to partition your mac. If you don't have a hard drive or ipod that you want to partition, the mac would be the last choice. But if you have an external hard drive, just partition it with disk utility, restore the DMG file onto your partition, and boot up your computer from the partition. You can then install onto another partition or just onto your computer, and since you only have 6 GB you might want to do the former, or else free up some more disk space.

If that's too confusing, just tell us how you want to install it (DVD, Mac partition, iPod, External HD), and where you want to install it (Mac, External HD), so we can help you more clearly. The one thing you CAN'T do, though, is just mount the DMG file, and double click ""Install"" without it being on some other media first (because the computer won't have anything to boot from)."
