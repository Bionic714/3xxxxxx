Full, working, DMG file. Just burn normally with Disk Utility and boot/install. This file was created with the usenet upload, with proper PAR files. I have tested this disk image myself, burned a DVD-DL, installed it. Works fine, in every way.

Enjoy. Spread the love. Buy the official Leopard when it ships!
