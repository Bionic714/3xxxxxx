,Suzanne363,2008-05-17T17:10Z,have problems with downloading the files of the mozart effect. the rest is ok. Does anybody have the same problem (and a solution?)
,dpaul420,2008-05-27T06:01Z,"I am really interested in this file...however, no matter what torrent site I look on and try downloading this file, I always get an error, even with different torrent programs. Has anyone else had this problem? There are so many seeders I would like to jump on this torrent right away! Thanks."
,sfuel,2008-05-28T09:23Z,Thanks for the great torrent. But are some of the files in The Mozart Effect sections corrupted? I've dl'd a couple of times and have the same prob.
,sfuel,2008-05-28T11:07Z,Sorry - nothing wrong with the files just the names are too long. Just rename the folders to something shorter. Thanks again for a great job.
,Ear-wax,2008-06-27T10:40Z,"The file names are both too long and contain non-European characters and unless the correct fonts are installed, Windows get upset, and we all know it doesn't take much to upset windows. In my case this torrent cost me several days with a BSOD (error 0x00000004) every time I started uTorrent, when I deleted the file I was able to recover the drive from where I left off."
,iTzypies,2008-10-21T14:13Z,Seed please!!

,neo6488,2011-06-25T15:35Z,"Alright so i got it to work but not in the normal way.

I googled ""music for mom and babies torrent' and was able to find the same torrent on a different site and loaded trackers from there."
,virenplus,2011-08-26T23:58Z,"Like suggested by neo, i too got the trackers from an external source, link as below::

Thanks, for sharing!"
