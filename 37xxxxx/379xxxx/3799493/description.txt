.....this is a pic of my Esky config for Realflight G3 .... it works fine for me .... but I must stress that it is very important to recalibrate each time you change a setting and you must bring up the rc (press kb 2) in G3 to make sure you have the sticks centered ...apart from that it should work but it can get tricky for some unknown reason ...just keep trying .... a lot of downloads on this so it will work .....!!!!
