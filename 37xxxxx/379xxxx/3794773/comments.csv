,sspilopss,2007-10-25T09:24Z,"thnx for this sweet chopper, but having prob with the ships. I know there r many issues with this release but all the ships seem to be in the right spots. Just under them is a piece of land and they r sitting on top with long runways visible on what i guess is the landable part of the ship.

when u install the scenery.cfg is not modified so i added the scenery manually   in many different configurations with no luck.

anybody having the same problems or its just me. If so anybody got a fix for this

Thanx to all who make it possible for us to enjoy sims to there fullest "
