Hong Kong action returns in a big way with the thrilling summer hit Invisible Target! Director Benny Chan (Gen-X Cops, New Police Story) assembles a dynamite cast of stars, including Nicholas Tse and Shawn Yue of Dragon Tiger Gate, plus young Jaycee Chan, son of the master himself, Jackie Chan. The actors play three very different cops who join forces to take down a vicious gang of thieves, led by martial arts star Wu Jing (SPL) and Andy On (New Police Story). The actors performed many of their own stunts, and the film's kinetic action and breathtaking stuntwork possess an excitement and energy that were once synonymous with the Hong Kong Cinema label. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the jaw-dropping climax, set in a police station, and featuring more bone-crunching action and broken glass than umpteen similar films. For action cinema fans, Invisible Target easily represents 2007's best and most satisfying blowout.
