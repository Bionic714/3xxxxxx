Open Burning Rom, Select DVD disc from the drop-down menu, Select DVD-Video, Click [New] button, then all these files to the VIDEO_TS folder only, leave the AUDIO_TS folder empty, the default settings should be good, Click the 'Label' tab label your disc title; in this case ' Invisible Target', select the 'Burn' tab, hit [Burn] button and enjoy."
