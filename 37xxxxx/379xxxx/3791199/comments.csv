Smith does the monologue (and an awesome fucking job of it) as Huey, as Spike interweaves his narration together with archival footage. Smith should have gotten an oscar for this performance...watch it..seed it..love it

someone uploaded panther not too long ago as well (by van peebles), another great party based on the black panthers... http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3732258/Panther_(1995)

agnes vardas documentary ""Huey""- on the free huey rally held on Newton's birthday on Feb 17 1968 in Alameda, California in protest of Newtons arrest for allegedly killing a police office- an act which was believed to be a set up (see COINTELPRO)- can be viewed here. http://www.ubu.com/film/varda.html"
