SUMMARY

Don Quixote is an early novel written by Spanish author Miguel de
Cervantes Saavedra. Cervantes created a fictional origin for the story
in the character of the Morisco historian, Cide Hamete Benengeli, whom
he claims to have hired to translate the story from an Arabic
manuscript he found in Toledo's bedraggled old Jewish quarter.

The protagonist, Alonso Quixano, is a minor landowner who has read so
many stories of chivalry that he descends into fantasy and becomes
convinced he is a knight errant. Together with his companion Sancho
Panza, the self-styled Don Quixote de la Mancha sets out in search of
adventures. His "lady" is Dulcinea del Toboso, an imaginary object of
his courtly love crafted from a neighbouring farmgirl by the
illusion-struck "knight" (her real name is Aldonza Lorenzo, and she is
totally unaware of his feelings for her. In addition, she never
actually appears in the novel).

Published in two volumes a decade apart, Don Quixote is the most
influential work of literature to emerge from the Spanish Golden Age
and perhaps the entire Spanish literary canon. As a founding work of
modern Western literature, it regularly appears at or near the top of
lists of the greatest works of fiction ever published.
