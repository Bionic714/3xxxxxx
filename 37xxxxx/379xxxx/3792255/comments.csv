,rogard,2007-09-02T02:30Z,and please explain why you use Flaite in the name of the torrent for a file that says axxo...hm?
,rogard,2007-09-02T02:31Z,and then you deleted the torrent or what?

,rogard,2007-09-02T02:39Z,"lol...thats the point here...Why should I download your crap just to make sure they are crap. I know already. And even if they are not fakes, it's your fault I am suspecting something. Next time you say, oh, I had to change the title ffrom fuck-dumbass-crap.avi to Harry Potter dvdrip.avi, because my dvd player would not play it otherwise. lol. Dickhead."
