You need world of warcraft burning crusade version 2.1.3, if you dont have it look at www.chaoscrusade.com for links to download it

copy paste that into your realmlist and remove the other stuff in it,
you can find the realmlist.wtf in your wow folder.
right click and open with notepad on the realmlist.wtf

enjoy chaoscrusade :)

its just a small notepad file after all"

,_Whoopy_,2007-09-05T14:09Z,"Bad server? what about trying it first, i bet that ""extreme server"" of u doesnt get a 1k playercount?
more like ""players online: 3 gms online: 1"" server?
also, if u have tier 6 and all that stuff, ur bored in a few days, on our server the leveling takes about 1 hour for some more for some less, and u can buy Tier 1-2-3 but u have to actually raid for Tier4-5-6, to give u something to do, also the server is free just like that 1 ur telling me about, 
free and with way more players :) custom events to :), you should check out the stairway events, you can win a nice legendary cloak ;)"
