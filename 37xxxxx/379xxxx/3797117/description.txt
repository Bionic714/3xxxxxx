Move over Ghost Hunters because the Haunted Investigators are in town.
And they're putting their college level educations to seek out and document
paranormal activity.

In the first investigation, the team travels to an infamous jail in Ohio. Hundreds
of people have experienced unexplainable things there.

In the second investigation, the team travels to Patterson Tower.  Being a
lookout post during the civil war, people claim that spirits still haunt the area.

With a team composed of a video and audio specialist, a photography specialist,
and a Buddhist priest, they will venture into the night and explore the paranormal.

The Haunted Investigators are back for another round and this time they head
to "Prospect Place" and the "Ritz Theater."

Prospect Place is said to house at least 3 restless spirits.  All of people who
died tragically on the property.

The staff working at the Ritz Theater all claim after the sun goes down, mysterious
things begin to occur.  Can this team draw out the spirits that dwell here?
