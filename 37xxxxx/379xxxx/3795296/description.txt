Synopsis

Charlton Heston, Anne Baxter and Tom Tryon are Three Violent People in this taut, lean-as-leather western with an emphasis on character.
Heston is straightlaced rancher Colt Saunders, an ex-Confederate cavalryman coping with the land-grabbing tax policies of greedy Reconstruction leaders. Baxter (HestonÂ´s costar in The Ten Commandments) plays SaunderÂ´s bride Lorna, whoÂ´s determined to hide her shady past from her intolerant husband. And Tom Tryon (author of The Other) is Cinch Saunders, an amputee embittered by his brotherÂ´s dominance. Colt, Lorna and Cinch are volatile ingredients destined to explode. When the carpetbaggers cagily play each of the trio against each other, little do they know theyÂ´re playing with fire..
