,zZzO0oErLiNgo0OzZz,2007-09-06T20:23Z,"sound fun do you know if it works on vista ? 
i can help you seed on this one :)"
,zZzO0oErLiNgo0OzZz,2007-09-06T20:23Z,sounds*
,lordgodders,2007-09-06T22:55Z,"zZzO0oErLiNgo0OzZz

Sorry don't know if works on Vista.  Does Vista have compatability option similar to XP?

Also please note that my ISP restricts my bandwidth between 6pm and midnight GMT, although upgrading to ""8Mbs"" very soon.  My PC is online overnight for faster uploads.  "
,lordgodders,2007-09-06T23:11Z,"Try http://www.systemrequirementslab.com which will check your PC to see if it will work.  

Unfortunately, I don't think it will.

After midnight will upload a selection of movies"
,lordgodders,2007-09-07T01:01Z,Movie clips of the game at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3797947
,zZzO0oErLiNgo0OzZz,2007-09-07T15:30Z,thanks :) yeah i have xp service pack 2 so i can try to drive it in compatible modus  :)
,frippe93,2007-09-16T11:03Z,seed I'm downloading 1 kb/s
,Arctic_swed,2007-09-19T12:55Z,Seed it im only on 8kb/s
,skeloric,2007-09-19T23:32Z,"Someone lately has been choking the hell out of the bandwidth in order to achieve ""Proxy Seeders"".
Some DLs go 40k+ with a single Seeder and yet others declare they have 6 or 7 seeders but yet the DL never speed never climbs out of the basement (1k or less)
Someone seems to have some ""revenge agenda"" going on and is using the choked bandwidth to accomplish it. "
,mxrider696,2007-09-25T03:03Z,ok im new at this so how do you replace the crack with the origional
,lordgodders,2007-09-26T18:00Z,Just copy the .exe file in the crack folder and paste it over the original .exe where the game is installed
,mxrider696,2007-09-29T05:34Z,It keeps saying that it has encountered a problem and needs to close and i can either debug send error report or dont send
,lordgodders,2007-09-29T10:38Z,Try running game in windows 98 compatability mode.  This may sound strange but it can work in some cases.
,mxrider696,2007-09-29T20:15Z,no im still getting the same thing do u know where i can get a keygen or do u know any thing else i can try
,lordgodders,2007-10-02T12:43Z,"The game doesn't need a keygen, try http://www.systemrequirementslab.com to see if you have any compatability problems. "
,skullC4ndy,2007-12-02T22:22Z,demo?? 
,Hasselnot94,2008-01-02T11:37Z,"I cant get this thing to work, what do you mean by ""replace crack .exe with original."" do i have to delete the cd files before i start or what?"
,Hasselnot94,2008-01-02T11:37Z,Im kinda n00b
,rev64,2008-01-07T12:27Z,"Does it work?
Nobody comments about its quality..."
,rev64,2008-01-22T02:03Z,"Okay its been over a week since i left a comment here!
And im gonna tell you guyz that it worked for me!
Thnx For the upload, lordgodder!
The only thing i could say is that you need more seeders!
my max download rate is 50kb/s!
It is still too slow!
BTW, Thnx for this great upload
if you guyz have anymore problems about the installation
mail me @ game_dave@yahoo.com
but be sure to check the system requirements first!"
,flash_bang_me,2008-02-17T20:23Z,"For some reason I can't get this one to work, I can't see  to mount the images or anything. Could someone help me out? Thanks."
,HornyHornedReaper,2008-03-07T22:18Z,Woohoo! Do I have really so fast internet? 4 Seeders! AND 15 PEERS!!! And i have still 200 kb/s....
,sexy_time,2008-03-08T23:16Z,o mai god. dis so fokin fast! like jel-o thru sleeve of wizard.
,oniryo,2008-03-23T19:19Z,"It wont mount the images ><

However I do know how to fix it >=D Open the .cue files in wordpad (or notepad) then on the first line you'll see something about rld-stzc.bin inside quotes. Just change that to CD1.bin CD2.bin or CD3.bin and save the files. Once you've done that to all 3 cue files, they will work right :) (note the rld-stzc is for the third disk... the first two will have a or b as the last letter most likly)

thanks for the up even if it was being a little screwy at first :)"
,olvenus,2008-03-26T22:13Z,"Does anyone know if it works on vista, I pass al  system requirements "
,eagledead666,2008-04-05T23:32Z,"Hm , i canÂ´t get this to work, i have mounted all the files but when i want to apply the patch it msays that the cd is wrong :S"
,eagledead666,2008-04-06T08:54Z,"Haha, i gave up and went to bed last night, when i woke up and tried it worked the first time XD"
,Bobdelaat,2008-04-16T15:18Z,"It says: A problem occured initializing DirectDraw. Hardware acceleration maybe disabled, please run DXDIAG."
,cloonwars,2008-05-12T15:00Z,for those who get a black screen at lunching I have the solution : instll the game but don't apply the patch and then download the no DVD crack for version 1.0 from here :http://gamecopyworld.com/
,CitationX525,2008-05-17T18:24Z,"They don't have a ""no -DVD"" and it's CD so why would that help.

Second, this game is fucked up beyond belief. It flashes all over the place when you play it and I have well above the ""minimum"" requirements for this game. Don't download this it's a waste of time. "
