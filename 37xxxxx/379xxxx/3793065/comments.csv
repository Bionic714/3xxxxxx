,BurnTheMasons,2008-04-03T16:40Z,This is all japanese. Can you help me?
,LuiSlayer,2008-04-30T22:28Z,"Hey, I can't put the subtitles to work!!
Can someone tell me what is the best program to see this files? Or to make the subtitles to work...
Please!! 
I love this shit and I don't know japanese!!!"
,Jablomy,2009-01-17T22:49Z,@LuiSlayer : I would recommend VLC player. It has high compatibility and will even show subtitles - worked for every Japanese anime I've watched so far.
,genkouhande,2009-01-23T09:05Z,"damn. i was searching ""Lupin the Third"" and could find season 1 lol. tried Lupin III and here it is. Thanks so much! I'll make sure to seed"
,genkouhande,2009-01-23T09:05Z,*couldn't find
,bookmunk,2009-02-06T17:47Z,"I am really disappointed that this is the best I can find.  There's no English audio, and the subtitle tracks would be a lot more useful if they were actually labeled."
,Bitterhope007,2009-02-25T21:29Z,"use media classic player works for me to get engl audio to work

Klite codc pack"
,Big-Tuna,2009-05-12T17:28Z,Klite codc pack Is the absalute best for everything! If you don't have it ppl get it!
,1mortos1,2009-06-01T12:09Z,"Average quality video, lots of subtitle options.

Absolutely no English audio. Tried in Windows Media Player, Media Player Classic, and in VLC, with K-Lite Codec pack."
,B_Sting,2009-08-15T00:05Z,"Yep, no English Audio.  It has many different subtitle options.... but no English audio.  

Anywho, thanks for the upload"
,aow42,2009-08-16T19:41Z,"@Bitterhope007:
How did you get to work the english audio in Media Player Classic?"
,dvor4k,2009-12-31T22:05Z,There is no English Audio with these files. There are subtitles though.
,kunminger,2010-02-25T23:31Z,thanks a lot
,R0CKLOBSTER,2010-03-22T22:29Z,"i have tried a lot of  methods to get the english audio to show up. i've used vlc and mpc with the mega klite pack and still no eng audio. i know how to switch audio tracks cause i've listened to a movie's commentary on mpc. i still think there just isnt one with the file. if someone knows how to make this appear then please say so. or maybe a DL just 4 eng audio?..   
still. thanks very much for uploading this, and thanks to the seeders that kept the speed pretty damn high for their number (18-20)!!!"
,darthmunky,2010-04-16T03:55Z,Absolutely 100% NO ENGLISH AUDIO! This is NOT dual audio! It's just Japanese audio with ten different subtitles options. Unwatchable without English audio.
,Jehabi,2010-04-27T10:12Z,"this is treasure, thx man.. is there season 3"
,BillyBob_junior,2010-05-09T19:56Z,"There is definitely no English audio, it only has the original Japanese audiotrack!
All episodes have an English subtitle track!
First 13 episodes even have 9 or 10 subtitles in the following languages:
 1. English
 2. French
 3. German
 4. Dutch
 5. Swedish
 6. Finnish
 7. Italian
 8. Spanish
 9. Czech
10. looks like a fake subtitle track"
,D4rks3r,2011-08-10T23:03Z,Could someone seed please? 
,Gmanjudo,2011-11-04T09:15Z,"This is amazing. Downloaded and will seed forever. English subs are a bit funky sometimes, but still awesome."
