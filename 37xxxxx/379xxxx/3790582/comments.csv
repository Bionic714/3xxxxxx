,SILVERTO,2008-02-18T23:11Z,"This one works!!! :=) I have been trying for days now. And we are all satisfied that i finally made it! Thanks to easy thinking.. Here`s what I did:

First i removed the other TTN from my HTC TC.
I then did as the readme file said. Copy and insert the card. It then started on its own. (P.S: I did in fact remove everything in my device-programfiles-navigator) When i inserted my SD card autorun started. Then I got scared when i saw i had problems fixing the map. But by pressing manuel on the question I got my DEVICE ID!! Then I got the map! Then I got scared ones more when i saw there was no gps signal. I chose the ""other bluetooth gps reciver"" And it works!!! Great!:=) I chose com4!! This was for HTC TOUCH CRUISE. jauminsainn!"
