,furioso1,2007-09-08T20:09Z,"few questions: is this a true dvdrip? (would be the first you know) and are those swedisch subs hardcoded, or an external srt-file?"
,Schwein,2007-09-08T20:21Z,furioso1: Check the files to be downloaded and you'll see it's just two avi:s. That would mean that the subtitles have to be embedded in the movie.
[T],SweJimmy,2007-09-08T20:38Z,The subtitle is burned into the .avi files so don't worry...
,Gerry_A,2007-09-09T07:13Z,"""Don't worry?"" If it's hardcoded into the movie, then all I have to say is ""What a shitty thing to do to a movie, do it the right way or leave it alone! I ignore this crappy stuff and wait for something decent"""
[T],SweJimmy,2007-09-09T11:31Z,Sure.... Swedish rocks!!!!
,Pingu_90,2007-09-10T00:07Z,i think its much easier have a movie with subtitels burnt into the movie then in a seperet file. but hey if u dont want to have subtitles then dont download a movie with subtitles and why the hell do u coment the film if u dont gonna download. :S really stupid!
[T],SweJimmy,2007-09-10T19:17Z,Agree with you =D
[T],SweJimmy,2007-11-02T19:16Z,Inga Problem =)
,Candide78,2008-05-19T19:26Z,Hi. Why are there several different file sizes for this movie? Is the movie resolution better for the 966MB compared to the more common 700MB file size?
