Anyone know where to find a cracked version of the FSUIPC for FSX?"
,rustydog47,2007-09-06T18:13Z,We need 4X-AXG or Daniel=(the original supplier of the flight1 de-wrappers) to help us out! I too would love to have this plane.  What would be awesome is if someone made a new de-wrapper for the new 3.10 files.  flight1_loader_v381.exe doesn't crack wrapper v3.10.
,cseries,2007-09-08T05:00Z,no more seed?!?!
,cseries,2007-09-09T15:09Z,anyone have the new flight1_loader for fsx?
,Raptor05121,2007-11-08T23:16Z,we need a crack!
,TheOnlyPilot,2008-01-02T19:08Z,"Any chance of a reseed of this one? I know how to get it working. All you need is a working version of the SR22 or SR20, which is easy to get, and you can make this work. Just need this reuploaded so I can do it fresh and make sure it works right. I just need the ripped version of this (I know, license files, blah blah blah, I can get past that). Any help would be awesome!"
