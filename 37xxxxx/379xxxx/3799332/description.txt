An anonymous source gave me this a while back ago. It works, except for the fact that  Windows XP VLK keys don't validate as genuine.

I figured I'd release it because I figure it's possible for hackers to reverse engineer it somehow and make something else that's even more useful.

With Vista out, Microsoft will care about this leak but won't go too crazy.

Enjoy and hack on!
