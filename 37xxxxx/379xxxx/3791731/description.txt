The idea of communicating with the dead is one of those ancient and timeless human
fascinations.  Just turn on your television or check out the movie listings.  Ghost
stories depend on the entertainment premise shown as suspending one's disbelief.
The Richard Hugo House on Capital Hill in Seattle was built in 1902.  In the 40's,
the house was converted into a funeral parlor.  In the mid-90's, it was converted into
an artistic space.  At this time, the house began having some hauntings which is
where AGHOST, the Amateur Ghost Hunters of Seattle-Tacoma, comes into the story.
They are the largest paranormal research group in the Northwest.  The men and women
of AGHOST include ghost believes and skeptics.  But when strange things start to
happen, everyone starts to wonder.  ABC's "Nightline" follows these modern day 
"Ghostbusters" into the spooky Richard Hugo House in Seattle.  Anchored by Chris 
Bury.
