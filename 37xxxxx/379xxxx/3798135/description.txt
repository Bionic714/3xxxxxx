Originally aired 9/5/07

After James Brooks vanishes on a remote ranch, local police know 
finding one cowboy on over 30,000 acres of unforgiving terrain won?t 
be easy, so they call in Indian trackers to follow Brooks? trail. The 
search and recovery quickly becomes a homicide investigation when 
Brooks is found dead from a gunshot wound to the chest. But with 
no witnesses, no clues and no motive, they turn to psychic Laurie 
McQuarry for help. Can her vision of a high-powered rifle help discover 
who may have been lying in wait for this genial cowboy?
