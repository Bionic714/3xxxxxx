,Pingsterness,2010-05-09T19:35Z,"A new Iron Man series titled ""Invincible Iron Man"" started in early 2005 with the Warren Ellis written storyline ""Extremis"", with artist Adi Granov.[13]  The series title changed its title to just Iron Man with issue #13 during the ""Civil War"" storyline and then later to Iron Man: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. with issue #15 due to the fallout of the ""Civil War"" story arc. In issue #33, the book changed its title once again to War Machine: Weapon of S.H.I.E.L.D. which tied into company-wide ""Secret Invasion"" storyline and resulted in the launch of a War Machine ongoing series.

Are there all 33+ issues? 

And it better not be PW protected!"
