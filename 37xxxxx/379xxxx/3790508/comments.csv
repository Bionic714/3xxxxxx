,HTMLCODER.exe,2007-09-09T17:09Z,10x i enjoyed it
,Minerva.TheGift,2007-11-14T22:13Z,"Thanks for the Torrent! I just wanted to let everyone know that these truly are the 7 HP books.  They are not scans or photos of books, but instead are just text dumps (so the page numbers likely don't match any version in print) but all the content (except pictures) seems to be in tact.  I think that the smile file size afforded by the text dumps makes it definitely worth it.  Thanks again!

,zaif,2007-12-09T13:56Z,"kan ingen lägga ut böckerna på svenska, "
,Kotatsu_,2007-12-10T17:44Z,"zaif, det är inte värt att läsa HP på svenska, översättningarna är värdelösa!"
,slagregate,2008-02-22T07:32Z,"At least some of these are more complete than average. I don't know which ones or how much, but I do know that a missing page in 1 book from every other copy has been replaced here"

,FernandesVincent,2009-06-18T22:12Z,"Thank you so much, Epistis! I don't know how to thank you properly. My braille centrum don't want to convert books in braille for me anymore, and I thought that I wasn't going to be able to read the books at all, but having downloaded your great pdf's I'm able to read the books on my computer. Thanks a lot!"
,t1nuSK4,2009-06-25T01:53Z,"!!!!!!!CAREFUL!!!!!!!!!

When I downloaded this, within 5 days I got an e-mail from my provider (it was forwarded), that I have downloaded illegal content and broken copyright laws. As a result, I was disconnected.

Luckily, I am not US citizen, so FUCK their copyright laws, but damn, it did cause me trouble.

So - be careful about this one."
,t1nuSK4,2009-06-25T19:04Z,"Update - the one tracking this torrent is MediaSentry, a company responsible for gathering evidence to be used in courts against US citizens.

Maximum caution advised."

,beautifullymundane,2009-07-23T07:06Z,"CAUTION WHEN DOWNLOADING:  I just experienced, firsthand, what t1nuSK4 was talking about.  Less than twenty four hours after downloading this torrent, I received and e-mail from my internet service provider, stating that a copyright owner had filed a complaint due to illegal downloading, specifically listing all seven of these published works.  It was a warning, threatening to terminate my service if it happened again.  Avoid if at all possible.  Happy pirating."
,fadedexile,2009-07-25T08:11Z,"Hey, you can avoid those nasty letters from your IP provider by downloading and installing ""Peer Guardian."" I've seen it block MediaSentry pings many times since I started using it.  "
