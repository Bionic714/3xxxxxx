,rjfrederick,2008-01-01T09:54Z,"WARNING - The keygen contains the  ""New Malware.aj"" trojan"
,wackopath,2008-12-26T14:56Z,"@ komplettidiot , you must make a key this way:
""name#name"" , ie.   ""crazy#horse"" (without quotes) and you will get the keygen to work."
,tback,2009-02-18T12:30Z,"Jupps, ""Keygen"" triggered Symantec Antivirus to go bananas and delete the file...
Could be because it was determined as a ""hacktool"" but never the less - be careful!"
