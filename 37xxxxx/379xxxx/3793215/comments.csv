1.	Download DVD Dumper v1.2 or above from internet or similar program.
2.	Put SD Card in computer
3.	Copy the DVD Dumper program to its own folder under ?apps? and rename it to ?boot.dol?.
4.	Go into homebrew channel, find the DVD Dumper program and run it. Select ?wifi? for your download method. Your wii?s ip address is shown
5.	Type this address into a web browser on your computer
6.	Confirm the download (XXXX.iso) and choose to save it to your desired download folder. Download will take a few hours."
