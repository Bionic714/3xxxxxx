FS2004 VFR Photographic Scenery Vol3 SW & Wales



Inspired by the herioc failure of flightcrazy (flightcrazy?s didn?t work well but his heart was in the right place!)
Here is Vol 3 South West England & Wales without the pain?.   No ripping CABS etc + this should install the mesh correctly 
rar with 3 discs of ISO's built using alcohol 120%

As with my other uploads it's actually the FS2002 version but is the same as FS2004 I believe.
You may need to run the FS2002_is_here.exe to install to FS2004 versions, this is in a folder on the 3rd disc with other useful utilities ;)

Thoroughly tested, burn to cd with Nero & go or just mount using Daemon Tools 

As before please can early adopters  give feedback!

And Purleese seed, I have about 45K up max...

Will start seeding when a request comes in
