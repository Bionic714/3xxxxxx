,ratty2e,2007-09-06T11:48Z,"Your welcome blankbox, still a long way to go to match your efforts.
and thnxs for the heads up on that website, think I might have a go at scenery creation at some point i can't believe Blackpool Tower doesn't exist already!

Thnxs to all the seeders
For the sake of completeness I may up the Vol 2 at some point soon so watch this space... 
In the meantime blankbox has a version available here:-

PS
Can anyone tell me if they've managed to get FSX running well and if so the spec of their PC? 
cheers"

,bruggemann,2007-09-09T15:39Z,"Hi, I get the message ""insert correct cd rom"" when running CD1. I have burned all 3 ISO´s with Nero. what do I do wrong ?"
,ratty2e,2007-09-09T22:37Z,"Hi Panadilo
will up Vol 2 in a few days 

Bruggermann
I suggest you try 2 things:-
1)  run the file FS2002_is_here.exe then try to install (run FS2004_is_here.exe after install to set the registry pointer back for the FS2004 folder)

if your sure that isn't the problem then

2)  download daemon tools, read up on useage of the program and mount the iso images then try an install (this will remove the possibility of a poor burn from the equation)
let us know if either work for the benfit of others!

cheers"
,bruggemann,2007-09-10T01:56Z,"Hi ratty2e,

Good news : it works now , this is what I did 
( however I cannot exactly point out what did the job)

1. downloading and installing daemon tools
2. fiddling around with it, maybe mounting the 3 ISO files, but I got no confirmation from the Daemon program itself that this was actually done.
3. I also clicked on SAFEDISC in the Daemon manager ( after the which the initially red Daemon logo turned green.)

Then I ran the ""setup.exe file"" from disc one 
( actually from the contents of it , which are located on my harddisk ) 
At this point, the  ""INSERT CORRECT CD ROM "" error message did not appear anymore.

Second small problem had to do with the FS2002 is HERE.exe file, which had to be installed first, into my FS2004 directory.

I finished installing further using discs 2 and 3 which I had previously burned with NERO.

So as you can see, I don´t exactly know what did the job, but you pointed me in the right direction for sure. A big thank you from across the channel.

On a final note, I don´t know what gave me greater satisfaction, having the scenery or being able to install it....

the Question remains"
,ratty2e,2007-09-10T20:30Z,"well done Bruggermann
It's all good!
you get the neat software and learn how to use a nice utility - Daemon tools saves wasting a cd on a corrupted download...

I suspect it was the FS2002_is_here that resolved it
Enjoy"
