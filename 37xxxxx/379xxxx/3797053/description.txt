Well here is another new version of WinRAR pushed out by F4CG. 3.71 is the latest version released by RARSoft, and is still in testing. There isn√¢??t much new stuff in this version but there are some nice bug fixes, so if you WinRAR keeps crashing then try this one, but just keep in mind that this is BETA so I suggest you exercise caution when installing this.

WinRAR is a powerful archive manager. It can backup your data and reduce size of email attachments, decompress RAR, ZIP and other files downloaded from Internet and create new archives in RAR and ZIP file format.

Program Features:

   
* Using WinRAR puts you ahead of the crowd when it comes to compression by consistently making smaller archives than the competition, saving disk space and transmission costs.
    
* WinRAR provides complete support for RAR and ZIP archives and is able to unpack CAB, ARJ, LZH, TAR, GZ, ACE, UUE, BZ2, JAR, ISO, 7Z, Z archives.
    * WinRAR offers a graphic interactive interface utilizing mouse and menus as well as the command line interface.
    
* Recovery record and recovery volumes allow to reconstruct even physically damaged archives.
    
* WinRAR features are constantly being developed to keep WinRAR ahead of the pack.
