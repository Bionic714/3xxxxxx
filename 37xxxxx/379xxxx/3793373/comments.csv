,umarnawazkhan,2008-12-29T16:40Z,"this movie is MFV file....
why not AVI?

why make things hard when you can do it the easy way?"
,Laughing_Griever,2009-01-16T02:11Z,"To ^umarnawazkhan^ - It needs to be an .mkv file because it has mutiple language packs to choose from. .mkv files are better and more advanced from what I've heard though this will be the first time I've played one after I download this.

Just download VLC Player, it's free and plays just about every audio and video file, even .mkv videa files.

Mega thx to the uploader for this.
Always seed... "

In the original Japanese that's how the names are. The English games shuffled the names for some reason, and of course the movie followed suit."
