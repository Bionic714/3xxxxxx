When I saw this little program I thought that it might be some sort of Packet Sniffing tool, but infact this program records telephone calls, and then can play them back to you, or store them for later. This is a nice little tool if you have a working modem for this. I couldn?t find a detailed write-up, just a bunch of dot-points, so if you want more info please visit their website! www.modemspy.com
