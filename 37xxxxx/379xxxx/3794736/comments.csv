,Kalys,2007-09-23T15:55Z,"How about a seed for this, huh? It says it'll take a day or two sometimes, then shoots all the way down to 3 hours or so then goes right back up again. Can someone seed this some more, please?"
,deslni01,2008-02-15T18:39Z,"A seed would be really, really nice about now, when there aren't any. Seed until I finish and then quit - I'll continue seeding."
,candrum28,2008-10-18T09:28Z,can someone seed this??  My download wont start
,irodrigo,2008-11-18T13:22Z,"How can I convince you to seed ""Rise of the Dragon"" again?

It's my favorite game ever. You'd be my hero."
