There are analyzers for signal and modulation analysis such as a high resolution FFT, modulation speed, signal phase analyzers as well as bit domain analyzers. In addition there are several generic (universal) decoders (FSK, MFSK, MPSK, MSK, PAM and PSK) which are used to decode known/unknown transmissions. The generic decoders combined with universal bit tools provide the very best tools in the market for digital transmission decoding and analysis. These "generic" analyzers can be configured to almost any type of transmission mode. The more advanced the user, the more advanced the tools can become.
