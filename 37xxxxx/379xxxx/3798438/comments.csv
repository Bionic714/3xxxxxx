Säg till om ni behöver hjälp, eller om ni hittar några konstigheter eller fel med torrenten. Jag är ingen erfaren expert, men jag tycker det är på tiden att vi får en duglig torrent med detaljerad information, som gör att fler människor kan uppleva detta fantastiska spel."
,Svartskjorta,2007-09-07T21:07Z,"One of the greatest of all times, up there with Fallout and Fallout 2. Tired of the repetitive shit Bethesda force feeds you? PS: Torment puts the Role back in RPG."
,Vlaadimir,2007-09-09T17:00Z,The No-cd file contains a trojan. The rest of the files seems ok. Download this only if you have a good anti virus!
,Kindo,2007-09-09T17:44Z,"A trojan? That's bad publicity. I've had that crack for a long time (downloaded from Megagames) and I have never received a report of any trojan contained within it. Double-checking it now provides the same negative result.

It is not unheard of to hear of certain anti-virus programs who report trojans in some file, especially no-CD cracks like this one, without there actually being one.

Well, you all have the choice whether to use the crack or not. Go find a different crack, if you can, but I'm telling you, this is the only one I've found that works, and again, I am not receiving any reports of any trojans in it.

Bah. :("
,chte,2007-09-09T21:25Z,"At last! A proper torrent! Awesomes! This game RULES big cat!
Thank you! "
,chte,2007-09-09T21:26Z,"And no, there's no trojan."
,Kindo,2007-09-09T21:28Z,"Apparently it's a false positive report of a trojan, and in the reply you can get the file from its original site (it was made by Platter, a famous Torment tweaker) and is completely safe. The file is hosted on 
http://www.planescape-torment.org and not MegaGames."
,Kindo,2007-09-09T21:29Z,Nevermind what I said about reply. I can't seem to put the link to it in the comments here...
,Vlaadimir,2007-09-10T11:48Z,You are right and I am wrong :)
,Kindo,2007-09-10T17:02Z,"Oh, no matter. I'm glad someone got this false positive, seeing how I would never have found out about it otherwise. :)"
,Kindo,2007-09-10T17:04Z,"Also, since this torrent has been up for about three days now, I'm hoping at least a few people have managed to download the whole thing by now. It would be great if those people could give some feedback about quality and if you're pleased and so on.

,ddoomi,2007-09-26T16:41Z,"i have a problem...on cd2 THERE IS NO IMAGE...DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO...KINDO, help please....i tried both installations but it is not working....there is no image on cd2 :(("
,JaxAD,2007-09-27T10:23Z,I'm also having a slight bit of trouble though it could just be me and my newbness to torrents. There is no installation app in the download so I'm confused as to what to do. I'm going to try and copy all of CD2 to the CD1 file and then copy the crack and try that but otherwise I'm lost....and I don't like been lost :(
,ddoomi,2007-09-27T11:32Z,"no,there is only data on cd2, there is no image....dont know what to do...:((
CAN SOMEBODY HELP???"
,JaxAD,2007-09-27T12:13Z,Actually I've managed to install the game to my HD by unrar'ing (?) the very first file in the CD1 folder and using the Setup app but now I'm really at a loss as of what to with CD2. I'm going for the NoCD route btw. Could someone help please?
,ddoomi,2007-09-27T13:06Z,"yeah, I need help too...I managed to install the game but on cd2 there is no image...and the way with noCrack is not working....help, please.."
,ddoomi,2007-09-27T14:02Z,all the files on cd2 are cbf format and I cant do nothing anything with them....cant open....nothing...help...
,JaxAD,2007-09-27T15:05Z,"well ive figured most of it out now, the hard bit was finding the game directory but now im having a lil bit of hassle with the game asking for cd2 after character creation. icopied the cd2 folder to the game directory and that didn't work. i copied the actual contents to the game directory and that didn't work and ive unrar'ed the first file in the cd2 folder and copied all the cbf files to the game directory and it still isn't working :(

note: these are all in the same game directory so maybe clashing going on somewhere? "
,ddoomi,2007-09-28T13:38Z,i have made it...the game rocks....
,Kindo,2007-09-29T14:33Z,"JaxAD: Have you followed the instructions properly? If you want a regular installation, you do not need to copy the cd2-folder into the game directory, but you need to mount/burn the image instead. Look through the instructions on how to make a full install again, and make sure you've followed the steps carefully.

I'm sorry to hear about your troubles installing and playing the game, but I really thought I had included very clear and detailed instructions on how to make it all work. Sure, some things could have been explained in a more ""simple"" fashion, but I would still think anyone who's been fiddling with PC-games before should have any problems."
,daystogo90,2007-10-29T05:37Z,Hey great game works perfect  I just unrared it and then burned it to cd's  installed game and wow this is one hell of a rpg  no problems playing no trojans or anything bad just a really good torrent  I commend you  
,Kindo,2007-10-31T17:50Z,Thanks for the good feedback. It sure is a great game. ;)
,SomeRandomGuy,2007-11-09T16:35Z,"Ive heard nothing but good things about this game. Im currently downloading it with a dialup connection lol ... after 2 days Im at 50%. I see its made by BlackIsle, who made Fallout 2, one of my favorite games of all time. How does Planescape compare?"
,Kindo,2007-11-10T15:28Z,"Well, SomeRandomGuy, I love Fallout/Fallout 2 immensely, and I'm super-hyped to try out Fallout 3 once it's out, even though Bethesda might screw it up. In any case, Torment does not compare to it. The settings and game-styles are completely different, and the stories told are not even similar. Torment has a lot of text and a lot of things to explore through it, and a much more extensive universe to learn about, but they are both amazing titles. I can't guarantee you'll love Torment if you love Fallout, however, seeing how they are so different."
,DanielPowell,2007-11-18T20:49Z,"Hey Kindo i am having an issue, I installed the image of cd one on a disk and it works fine, i installed and everything is peachy with cd 1, but i opened folder 2 and i saw all the contents in it and copied to another blank cd and it doesnt make the ""please insert cd 2"" error message when i start the game, i loved baldurs gate 2 and beat it many times so im dying to play this, could you help please?"
,Kindo,2007-11-18T22:27Z,"It's hard to give you step-by-step guides on how to make a proper CD of the images, and I don't know how you've been doing your burn-processes, but you need to burn the .iso-files, obviously, and not just click/drag the folders."
,Nyck26,2007-11-23T09:42Z,Now this is a good example about how a game torrent should be. It's very well organized and very well explained. It is also already patched and there are also some unofficial patches and tweaks for the game. It works perfect. Nice job Kindo! You have 10/10 from me.
,Kindo,2007-11-23T13:15Z,Thank you for the compliments. :)
,Jonnyrocketti,2007-11-24T15:51Z,"Kindo, thank you for your hard work. 

I am new to this, but I think I've followed all your directions correctly. I'm having a problem similar to others in that I can't seem to find an .iso file to mount. I dl'd daemon tools and winrar. When I extract the CD1 file, it just splits it up into 22 different files: 

torment.cd1-Kindo.part 01, 02, 03 etc.

I tried mounting anything and everything and nothing seems to work. Can anyone help me out with this?  

IM is Jonnyrocketti. Thanks!"
,Jonnyrocketti,2007-11-24T21:23Z,"I even extracted all the parts and it gave me an .iso file, but still no luck. I still get the ""insert disc 2"" prompt. 

I tried extracting the .iso file and it gave me a bunch of cbf and bif files.  "
,Steadmanofour,2007-11-25T09:07Z,"Well done! I have not yet played it, but installation was a breeze and the crack worked perfectly. "
,Kindo,2007-11-25T11:29Z,"Jonnyrocketti: When you have those 22 different files you're talking about, right-click on either of them and choose Extract, and it will extract the .iso that's packed up inside those files. You must do the same for CD2 (which has 21 files), and it should leave you with two .iso files These are ""images"" of actual CD's, nesting on your hard drive rather than a physical CD.

Using Daemon Tools, mount the first cd onto a virtual drive (instructions should be in Daemon Tools, but right-click on the system tray icon, go to Virtual CD/DVD-ROM and then Set Number of Devices. Having just one device is enough to play the game, but it doesn't matter how many you have. Then choose one of those devices in the same sub-menu, and click Mount Image. That's where you should mount those big .iso files you extracted earlier, one at the time.) After installation from CD1 is complete, mount CD2 onto that device instead.

Again, I pretty much covered installation procedures in the ReadME, and it's hard for me to go into detail on how to use common programs such as WinRAR and Daemon Tools. I hope it works out for you eventually, though. :)


Steadmanofour: I'm glad the installation worked smoothly for you. :)"
,glassofcoke,2007-11-26T22:45Z,"Hi Kindo. I have a problem with playing the game, even though I've read all the comments with instrutctions, pluss your entire readme file. The problem is mentioned in one comment, but the answer you gave didn't help me. 

When I start the game and creates the character, everything goes fine, but when puching ""accept"" it appears a message saying ""Please place Planescape: Torment disc number 2 in drive C""

I've unrared cd1 and cd2, used daemon tools for getting the iso files (used the same drive for cd 2 and 1)  copied cd2 into the directory, unrared the crack in the directory, deleted ""ereg"" so the regestration message dissapeared, but even though I've done exactly how your instruction goes on, I keep getting this message that I have to place disc number 2 in C. 

I really hope you have a way to solve this for me, so I can play the game. Because, It's a fuckin great game! "
,Kindo,2007-11-27T10:15Z,"Have you made sure the path for the CD2-folder you've copied to the hard drive has been entered in the Torment.ini file, under [Alias]? It's mentioned in the ReadMe:

[Alias]
HD0:=C:\Program\Black Isle\Planescape - Torment\
CD1:=J:\CD1\
CD2:=C:\Program\Black Isle\Planescape - Torment\cd2
CD3:=C:\Program\Black Isle\Planescape - Torment\cd2
CD4:=C:\Program\Black Isle\Planescape - Torment\cd2

You need to the paths there to correspond with your own setup, where your game is installed, and where you put the cd2-folder. You also need to run the crack, after you've put it in the game directory.

If you have already done that (and double-checked the paths!), I apologize, but it's all I can think of to be the problem."
,Kindo,2007-11-27T10:18Z,"You kind of need to ""guide"" the game to read data from a specific point, which is governed by the Torment.ini file. Only you know what that specific point is, since we all have different machines, drive names, and installation preferences. Obviously, you need to feel some level of familiarity with these sort of things, but it's still pretty simple and easy to understand once you get the hang of how these Infinity Engine games work."
,Kindo,2007-11-27T10:21Z,"Again, I really tried to be as detailed as possible, and give simple step-by-step instructions, but I'm sorry some of you still have problems with the procedure. I standard installation option, however, should be really simple to perfor - seeing how it's like any other game installation (insert CD1 - install game - insert CD2 - play!)"
,Bavzor,2007-12-02T00:07Z,"Thanks for the torrent, instructions.  Installation went fine.

I am having a problem in the game, however.  Most spells seem to crash the game.  In fact, my PC locks up when they are cast.  Anyone else having this problem?  

Kind of a bummer, cause I'm a couple hours in and really diggin this game.  Any help would be appreciated."
,Kindo,2007-12-02T00:45Z,"Wow, that's a new problem for me. Sorry to hear it. I'm not sure what kind of solution we're looking at, but I assume issues like these may occur in several games from around that era, related to XP/Vista technicalities. I have a semi-new rig myself, but I have never encountered any problems with the spells with my set-up, so I'm afraid I'm at a loss. Since it's just for the spells, however, I would suggest turning 3D acceleration down, or something to a similar effect. 

I've been Googling the issue for a while, but I haven't come up with anything useful regarding crashes related to spells. Try asking around on forums on the sites that deal with Torment (such as sorcerers.net or the like), and maybe someone there has some insight in the matter.

Again, sorry to hear it. :("
,Bavzor,2007-12-02T01:05Z,"I'll give that a try.  

Thanks for the input and fast response, mang."
,Kindo,2007-12-02T02:20Z,"No problem. I check in on the torrent several times a day just to make sure.

Yeah, the spells are, as far as I know, the only instance in the game where actual 3D acceleration is used, hence my stab at the chance that it might have something to do with that. Still haven't found anything on the forums. "
,Bavzor,2007-12-02T18:05Z,"Followup:

Your suggestion to turn 3d acceleration off through dxdiag worked.  

The game is running perfectly now.  Thanks much for the help, Kindo.  You are the man."
,Kindo,2007-12-03T01:14Z,"Whoa, it worked! I'm really glad to hear that. Naturally, some effects may look a bit dulled-down, but since the game only uses 3D on very rare occasions (if not solely during spell-animations), it should be fine. Awesome! :D"
,deviant1369,2007-12-07T08:15Z,some of the torrents are as much as 2gigs this is just around 1gig... is this version full??
,Kindo,2007-12-07T15:21Z,"""some of the torrents are as much as 2gigs this is just around 1gig... is this version full??""

Yes, believe you me. I explain in the ReadMe that it's the 2-CD version, which is a version they made as a compressed alternative of the original 4-CD version - hence the smaller filesize. It's the full game, the real deal, and everything else with similar meanins. :)"
,Kindo,2007-12-07T15:22Z,Typos are annoying when you can't correct them...
,Verwandlung-,2007-12-08T18:02Z,"Thank you for uploading this game and writing a very good installation guide. 
And it's always nice to see an intelligent, polite conversation about the torrent/game.

thanks"
,Kindo,2007-12-09T04:04Z,"Thank you! I appreciate it. 
"
,Slumpy33,2008-01-07T11:15Z,For those who were having issues with mounting Cd2 with Daemon tools. You have to mount the cd as Kindo said. When it opens the window showing the folder cd2 with all those files that can't be used (as it did with me) simply exit that window and then open the game from your start menu or regular shortcut or whatever (not with daemon tools). The cd will stay mounted in daemon tools so all you have to do is hit the icon like you would a normal game and your all set. I had the same issue since I was unfamiliar with the stuff. Been working fine for me. Hope it helps and cheers to you Kindo for an A+ torrent.
,dbd420la,2008-01-12T00:02Z,"Im having A BIG Problem. yeah, so after installing, copying folder cd 2 to the game direct. to avoid images or cd's, installing the crack in the direct, made sure the file paths from the torment.ini file are leading to cd2 folder, and it STILL asks for a cd at points in the game where I suppose it needs to pull data off disc 2. ANY Idea at all, i havent even left the damm mortuary, cuz it wont load the upstairs without asking for disc 2  "
,dbd420la,2008-01-12T00:44Z,"this no cd crack is whack. After saying all went well, and the crack was installed...the DAMM thing STILL asks for a cd....how the hell is that a working no cd crack then???"
,Kindo,2008-01-12T13:04Z,"The majority of people who have installed the game are saying that it works perfectly, so obviously there's something else going wrong, that's not to blame on the No CD-crack. From what you're saying, however, I can find no error in your installation procedure, and it all checks out fine. All I can advice you to do is to try installing everything again, from the beginning, and really make sure that everything in the .ini corresponds with your own system setup (ie drive letters and installation folders). I hope it works out. :/"
,suck22,2008-01-13T00:38Z,"Hey, Kindo, there's no iso file or any kind of image files on cd2 folder. I did exactly what you told me but i can't load any iso file from cd2 folder into virtual drive. I try to use 2 kinds of program which is daemon tools and alcohol 52%. Help Me plaese, it took me 10 days to download it."
,dbd420la,2008-01-13T05:14Z,ive reinstalled and rechecked 6 times....still askes for cd after saying crack installation successful. Ive done this PLENTY of times....but Im Beat about this game torrent
,suck22,2008-01-14T18:37Z,"I got it... It so simple.
UnRar cd1 for ONCE only.
the icon will show Rar files but its not.
It is an iso files, use daemon to mount it.
You don't have to UnRar twice.
After mount cd1 on daemon, the installation
will commence automatically.
Install normally.
After that, UnRar cd2 only ONCE.
You will get cd2 iso files. Do not UnRar it.
Leave it alone. Mount cd2 on daemon.
Finally , you can play. Remember Unrar cd1 and cd2 for ONCE only. You will iso files , not rar files. Do not confused by the Compressed files ICON!!!!!!!!!!. Good Luck and many thanks to Kindo."
,Technocian,2008-02-05T01:02Z,suck22 thank you very much for the explination. Also guys remember disk 1 is for installation and disk 2 is for play! If you plan on burning you need BOTH. You never know when you may need to reinstall this game or just want to play it on a different computer.
,Technocian,2008-02-05T01:34Z,By the way. Great upload Kindo. The download speeds went very well for me thanks to a few good seeders. I shall do my part and give back to this torrent by seeding in return as well. Currently uploading at 65k/kbps as we speak. Enjoy the extra boost.
,shorelinetrance,2008-02-13T03:17Z,"can someone help me, at the beginnging of the game when i wanna go upstairs it asks for disc 2?

,Red_Band_of_the_Hand,2008-02-26T18:19Z,"Worked perfectly. Daemon tools took too long to create virtual hd, so I used poweriso instead. Mounted iso 1, installed, unmounted iso 1, then mounted iso 2 on the same drive I mounted iso 1 on, and ran planescape. Since I didn't want to have to mount iso 2 all the time, I moved the cd 2 folder to the planescape - torment folder in Program Files as Kindo instructed, and edited the Torment.ini file. It was easy. Thanks kindo."

Do not listen to this bozo! The crack in the torrent is working just fine (as can be proven by the many other comments made which claim they've managed to get the game running perfectly), and that 'crack.exe' file is most likely not healthy for your PC to run."
,on_screen,2008-04-20T17:25Z,Thanx Kindo for this wonderful release.
,on_screen,2008-04-20T18:32Z,"Btw, can someone clearly explain the difference between 4 and 2 disc releases? I heard some people claim that 2 disc version is ripped in some way."
,Kindo,2008-04-21T17:31Z,"on_screen: It is not ripped. The 2-disc version contains all the movies, environments, music, sounds, and other gameplay-related features, as the 4-disc version does. The only difference is that it has better compression and optimization in order to fit on just 2 CD's. I have no written document as proof of this, but I've been playing Torment for many years now - both versions - and assuming they both have the same patches and the like applied to them, they are completely identical."

I want a remake. :("
,Gent22,2008-04-30T02:07Z,"Hi

I got to the part where I'm supposed to edit the .ini file to direct it toward the cd2 I copied into the game directory. When I click on the ini file it opens up a note pad document and I edit it according to your guide but when I try to save it an error message comes up saying ""it cannot create the file, make sure your path and file name are correct."" I checked multiple times, and everything was correct. The problem seems to be that I am unable to save the changed file in an "".ini"" format but rather as a text document. Do I need software to edit ini files?

Another thing I'm having trouble with is when I run the No crack CD file and try to crack the game an error comes up saying it cannot find the file and asks me to locate it. So then I specify the CD2 .exe file but then it says that opening the file failed because ""patch was not applied""

Where do I find this patch and how do I apply it?

Thanks! I've never played the game before and am really excited to try it so I hope you still check the comments regularly!"
,Gent22,2008-04-30T02:41Z,"Ok, I figured out how to edit the ini file. Now I'm just having problems with the crack. I moved the crack folder into the Planescape file directory and then I run it but it says file not found then prompting me to locate it. I specify cd2 and then run the crack but then I get this error message after a few seconds.

,Kindo,2008-05-01T01:49Z,"Gent22: It seems like you are reading the instructions wrong. You are not supposed to specify CD2 when running the crack, but simply run the crack from the game's main directory (in your case it appears to be C:\Program Files\Black Isle\Planescape - Torment\)

So *not* in the CD2 sub-folder, nor does the cracking procedure have anything to do with the actualy CD-image (the .iso-file) - I have no idea why it's part of your directory path there while you're trying to crack the game. :(
"
,Whorse,2008-05-07T17:56Z,"Before I start, I'd like to congratulate Kindo on a brilliant torrent and even better participation! Good on ye mate!

About the CD check issues, even after re-installing many times, and re-editing the .ini even more times , immediately after character creation it requests CD2 again (I read someone else commented about the same issue). However if I don't install the no-cd, the game requests CD2 at start up and doesn't even make it to the main menu.

This is a very strange and rare issue, and definitely not Kindo's fault! I'll do my best to troll around google, and try solve the issue."
,Whorse,2008-05-07T18:13Z,"An update on my issue of CD2 being requested at inappropriate times even after the entire Crack process has been followed directly.

The issue is the patching. This version (2CD) is an updated version of the game, and is already updated to v1.1. If you attempt to patch the game (which is already patched) you will constantly get CD checks even after the crack.

Gent this applies to your issue also. I had the same problem with this No-CD crack.

I'll say it again DO NOT INSTALL V1.1 UPDATE OR INSTALL ANY OTHER NO-CD CRACK. Everything should be ok."
,Kindo,2008-05-08T00:57Z,"Whorse: Oh, is that the problem with these checks? I thought I was clear in saying it's already patched and ready. I'll remember that if anyone else is experiencing similar problems in the future. I keep thinking: ""Well, if you follow the instructions, everything should work fine!""

And thanks a lot for the compliments. It makes me very happy to see that so many are still seeding this, even though only a handful of people are actually downloading it. Dedication!"
,Kindo,2008-05-08T00:59Z,"I'm also playing with the thought of making one of those rips I see many games come in nowadays; which basically just is ""Unrar the archive - ready to play!"" meaning I'd apply the tweaks and fixes and such beforehand, so no tinkering on the user-side is needed. I will have to investigate how compatible that is with this game, however. Shouldn't be a problem, though."
,Deilure,2008-05-08T22:32Z,"I'm also experiencing the same problem as Whorse, but I cant seem to resolve it.  Whorse, was your problem caused by installing the v1.1 update? Or by using a different cd crack other than the one provided?  Because, like your problem, I still get the screen asking for CD 2 of Torment immediately after character creation even after applying the no-cd crack.  I installed the game, put the contents of CD2 into the game's directory, modified the .ini so it reads CD2 from the appropriate directory, used the no-cd crack, then extracted the unofficial fix pack into the override folder, followed by the restoration pack.  Not sure what else to do to get rid of those disc prompt screens."
,baktanus,2008-05-11T10:58Z,I'm currently downloading this torrent. I hope it works. Last time i downloaded a Baldur's Gate 2 torrent but there was a cyclic redundancy check. T_T it's hard to get a hold of this classics..

,kratosmaster,2008-05-12T02:17Z,"This torrent works perfectly!  I have figured out how to fix the problem where you get a CD check after the character creation screen: go buy the actual CDs.

Just kidding.

What you do is make sure that the torment.ini file mentioned in the directions is to be read by your computer to be Notepad by DEFAULT.  It doesn't make much sense to me either, but hell, it worked.  I use Vista, by the way.

This worked for me, and should work for you if you follow the directions PERFECTLY."
,kratosmaster,2008-05-12T02:18Z,"*EDIT TO THE ABOVE COMMENT*:

No opening cutscene when launching the game as scene in if you actually mount disk 2.  Not sure if anything else would be missing, but for the last 5 hours of my insanity's sake, they sure as hell better not be anything else missing."
,Kindo,2008-05-12T07:04Z,"Deilure: Strange. It seems you have followed the instructions to the letter, and thus, should not have any problems while running the game. :(

spamfaker: It's one of those false-positives that are not that uncommon when it comes to No CD-cracks. I addressed the issue in some earlier comments, but it's taken from the this website: http://planescape.outshine.com/ which contains a bunch of other fixes and downloads, many made by  a character named Platter, who has provided numerous tweaks and hacks to the game. Check it out.

baktanus: I've done my absolute best to make this release work as it should. Planescape: Torment is my favorite game of all time, and I love it more than anything else. Obviously I'm going to treat the game and this release with outmost respect and care. :)

kratosmaster: You have a point, though. If you actually can get a hold of a legal copy of the game, get it. It's because it's so difficult to find that I've provided this torrent, seeing how I want as many people as possible to experience that insane awesomeness that is Torment. ;)

And yes, you use NOTEPAD (or equivalent) to read and write .ini-files. Maybe I should have mentioned that, but I thought it was common knowledge for most. My bad.

About your missing opening sequence, it's completely beyond me. All the movies and everything else should already be in your installation directory, and thus have no problem playing as you progress through the game. The only thing I can think of is if the game itself doesn't play it automatically after initial launch of the game. You can also play back already-seen movies from the menu while in the game. I will test this to see how it behaves for me."
,Kindo,2008-05-12T17:08Z,"kratosmaster: I've tried running the game on several machines now, having followed the installation procedures listed here, and all the opening movies (BIS Logo, opening etc.) should play on start-up everytime you launch the game (unless you've hacked it somehow), and they read from the cd2-folder, as far as I can tell, so there must be something going wrong with that step of the installation, if your movies aren't playing as they should.

I'm sorry I can't be of more help. I will start working on an already installed and cracked release as soon as I get more time, so that all you have to do is to unpack the game and click play. Until then, I hope you can get it to work somehow."
,kratosmaster,2008-05-12T21:22Z,"*edit once again*

Never mind about it working perfectly.  I'm still getting CD checks every time the game tries to load a new area, including movies.  I'm going to try the whole process over again, and if it still doesn't work I'm going to give into the gods and declare defeat."
,kratosmaster,2008-05-12T23:24Z,"I'm done.  I know it isn't your fault Kindo, I'm just done being frustrated.  I'll just have to live the Quick play way of life."
,Raighne,2008-05-13T22:26Z,"FOR DISC-LESS INSTALLATION:

If you are getting the ""Load disc 2"" error after character creation and insist that you have followed the directions to the 't.'  ENSURE that you have changed the torment.ini file to look like this:

[Alias]
CD1:=C:\Program Files\Black Isle\Planescape - Torment\CD2
CD2:=C:\Program Files\Black Isle\Planescape - Torment\CD2
CD3:=C:\Program Files\Black Isle\Planescape - Torment\CD2
CD4:=C:\Program Files\Black Isle\Planescape - Torment\CD2
HD0:=C:\Program Files\Black Isle\Planescape - Torment

If you installed it to all the default directories, and then put CD2 inside of your directory, IT IS IN YOUR C DRIVE, NOT YOUR D DRIVE.  INSIST THAT YOU CHANGE IT IN THE .ini FOLDER AS WELL.  

It's common sense, but I admit it didn't even come to mind until after an hour or so of thinking of all the in-depth reasons as to why it wouldn't work.  I hope this helps at least a few of you!"
,Kindo,2008-05-14T00:13Z,"Raighne: Yes, as that's clearly stated in the instructions, it's very odd that people still experience problems with it. :("
,Whorse,2008-05-19T04:31Z,"Raighne the instructions have been made quite clear, it's also clear that there are more issues at play here unfortunately.

Deilure: it definately was the installation of v1.1 over an already patched v1.1 that caused the issues.

I'm using Windows XP Pro if anyone was wondering, and Daemon Tools Light. I have a nagging feeling that it's the image reading software that could be causing the problems.

Another great release to check out would be Baldur's Gate, and Baldur's Gate 2 if you weren't aware of them. A Mod called Baldur's Gate Trilogy also updates the graphics of the first game to that of the second, and creates a seamless playing experience between all the games and their expansions. I highly recommend this!"
,Kindo,2008-05-30T06:19Z,"Thank you very much, Rampand. Of course I do what I can to help others make their game run smoothly. After all, the main idea is to get as many people to play it as possible, seeing how it unknowingly is the best game ever created. ;)"

,DarkMario616,2008-08-24T19:42Z,"If anyone cares, and is cautious like me about that trojan crack. This is what you do if you want to avoid using it:

1) Download Daemon Tools
2) Install
3) Right click --> virtual drives
4) set number of devices to 2 
5) Set both drives to use disc 2 of Planescape
6) Play

It should work without using the crack, since it is for me. If it does not, try using 3 drives, then 4, if not then just use the crack, but it SHOULD work as it does for me."

,squarestance,2008-12-18T03:23Z,"hi, for anyone who still gets cd2 requests after having followed kindo's straightforward instructions (including no cd crack and both unofficial patches), here's something to consider : google -planetscape torment- and you'll see that a lot of people unconsciously spell it that way when really meaning -planescape torment-. i had a good look at my ini file and guess what : correcting my spelling mistake resolved the cd2 problem . the game was obviously looking for cd2 in a non-existent folder! i hope this helps. And Kindo: thanks a million."

Now when i try and play i get the error below right after character creation

Assertion failed D:\Torment\Source\Baldur\ChUIControls.cpp at line 527??

Now i do not know alot about computers so i have no idea what the heck this is i deleted the mod i tried the way without mounting where u trick it and use the cd crack i unistalled i did everything  and i always get that assertion crap right after character creation if anyone can help me at all that would be great.

,d0000h,2009-07-15T08:16Z,"For help with this error...
An Assertion failes in D:\Torment\Source\chitin\ChDimm.cppp at line number 809

This happened when I used the wide screen mod. I found this on line and it worked to fix the problem:
""I got it to work!! As you said it was because my monitor doesn't ""normally"" supprot 1280x800 (Even though my native res is 1920x1200 so the aspect ratio is the same and it *should* work)

For others who need to fix this, here's what you do:

How I could tell my res was non-standard, when I got to Start->Settings->Control Panel->Display in the ""Settings"" tab theres a slider with screen resolution. When I change that slider around there isn't a 1280x800 displayed as an option (this is your problem).

Because I have an NVidia card/driver the fix is this:
1. Click the advanced button on the settings tab you're in
2. In the advanced menu, find the otpion on one of the tabs of ""Start the NVIDIA Control Panel"" and click it
3. In the Advanced Settings, go to ""Manage Custom Resolutions"" or something like that depending on your driver version.
4. There should be a checkbox along the lines of ""Allow modes not exposed by the display"" and check this box.
5. Now go back to your display settings resolution slider, 1280x800 should now be an option and this mod should work!"""
,d0000h,2009-07-15T08:27Z,"I could not get the included crack to work (always failed CRC check). Also got insert CD2 all the time.

Fix = I got and used infinitycracker_v1.1.zip crack from gamecopyworld and also fixed my .ini to read

CD3:=C:\Program\Black Isle\Planescape - Torment\cd2\cd2
