SpeedyStart for Vista 


What does it do? 
SpeedyStart is my latest endeavor which sprouted from a request I read somewhere. It adds self defined, frequently used utilities, tasks, apps or even folders to your Start Button's context menu. It's pre-defined entries are there to only to give you a few ideas on what can be easily done with this simply great shell enhancer. Once you become accustomed to it you'll find yourself quickly missing not having SpeedyStart on a machine without it. 


Full user configurability 


Accessing frequently used items has never been quicker. 


Works with Windows XP & Vista
