,low_masters,2007-11-22T15:56Z,"I'm trying to extract the files using winrar but everytime i try to get setup exe it says ""you need to have the following volume to continue extraction"" Does this even work?"
,low_masters,2007-11-22T16:10Z,"NVM I got it to work, bloody complicated way of doing it though. I had to extract each cygnus zip file (CYGNUS.r00 - CYGNUS.r07) from the zip files cyg-ts41.zip to cyg-ts49.zip... whats the need to double zip it?"
,clint99,2008-01-02T23:41Z,"possible to run this on mac leopard?
"
,ilikemonkeys,2008-02-12T06:34Z,"Unfortunately not, there is no way unless you have parallels or something."
,tommywilliams1991,2008-03-01T09:39Z,wonderfull torrent mind if i repost with files unziped?
,Chriswatch,2008-03-12T11:00Z,"This works fine for me. You have to extract the big 40mb file and you will end up with like 9 Cyg-ts files about 5mb in size... extract the first one, (cyg-ts41 or Something)   

and it will ask you to complete the broken pieces. so start counting down from 41 to 49 or 42 to 49. I think you might need to extract each Cyg-Ts in order to get the winrar piece-file. (that means you might have to put the ""Cyg-ts files"" into there own folder due to the same name inside each file.  Once that does it you open up the setup file and put in your serial code,  and type in your nickname and your company name if you have one, and this file will pwn.
The serial still works. atleast for me, and thanks Antje14 this pwns :P  This downloaded in good speed for me and My connection is confusing and sometimes sucks :P and I'm using utorrent. oh and I received no viruses or any warning while extracting this."
,worubouk,2008-03-15T18:02Z,"koolio, I have a realy low download speed tho"
,Brutal_Slakt,2008-04-02T01:10Z,"When I try to install it I get an error message, I've fixed what it says can cause the error (something about the temporary folder, internet and something more) but it still doesn't work. I've looked for this program on other sites but it's the same version as this but I've tried them and they don't work either. >.< Help me someone? Please? "
,xhizors,2008-04-07T05:34Z,"In all honest don't waste your time downloading this! Just download it from the website and use the key, that is inside this torrent: 4aaa-46fc-d2fc  to activate it. This isn't worth your time. It's zipped, then there are 9 different zip files inside of that, then 10 different rar files inside of THOSE! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! Just get it from the website and use this Key."
,stefano3097,2008-04-11T08:40Z,"xhizors, i hope you come back to read this. Or else I hope someone else can answer this question.

I downloaded the free trial from the the website for my mac and I wanted to try xhizors serial but I don't know where to register.

can anyone tell me where to type in the serial or else where I can just download an already cracked version for mac os x?

I'm desperate to get this program. please help if you can. Thank you."
,tomophilia,2008-04-15T07:08Z,the free trial wont allow you to put in a serial i'll post a torrent thats good for osx though....and a serial that kanalda wrote on a message above does work
,stefano3097,2008-04-18T21:06Z,"tomophilia,
If you could hook me up with v4 for osx you'd be my hero! Also, since you seem to know a little bit, would you happen to know where I could find a version of Toon Boom's Storyboard for OSX? With those two programs combined I would be able to take over the world! (don't worry, for your help I shall give you half!)  ;)
Thank you! Thank You! Thank You!!!"
,tomophilia,2008-04-19T00:36Z,"HEy Stefano
     So.....i am having problems uploading this torrent, never fear though if you do a search on limewire for ""Toon Boom Studio 4 Apple OSX.zip"" you will certainly find it as i'm on 24 hours a day.  i will however keep trying to upload it. 
  if you download it from me before i post it you needn't give me half just post it and seed it
THanks
"
,stefano3097,2008-04-20T09:15Z,"tomophilia,
Thanks, I'll search for you on Limewire. Although if  you do get it posted here please let me know. I'll keep an eye open.
And tom, don't be so humble... Half the world will be yours! :) 
Viva La PirateBay-lution! "
,stefano3097,2008-04-20T09:46Z,"tomophilia,
Ok, I tried to find you on limewire, but was unsuccessful. :(  I found a lot of files but ALL were setup.exe when unzipped. Even the one entitled apple osx. None were .dmg files.
How very disappointing.
Well, anyway, maybe you can get the upload to work. Please let me know.

Oh, and do you have Storyboard?

Thanks SO much for the help!!!

Viva La Piratebay-lution!"
,tasteecakes,2008-06-04T06:57Z,Stefano3097? Tomophilia? Did either of you krazy kats have a working OSX version? I'll be your BFF.
,Chedderzbetter,2008-06-04T07:35Z,"From TBS PLE, This version released by Cygnus seems like its missing a few features... perhaps I have not discovered them yet??? but anyway after using it I feel that I now want to go and buy toon boom =)!!! thanks alot "
