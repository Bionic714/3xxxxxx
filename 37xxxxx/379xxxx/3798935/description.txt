Group CYGNUS just released an application which I personally never heared of, but i think a lot of you want to try it. With this software, you can make your own (2D) animations. So when you?re into drawing, and like animations, just make some yourself now!

Covering the entire animation workflow from sketching to final publishing, you will find Toon Boom Studio to be a great tool to create or learn animation.

Toon Boom Studio offers true animation features designed to facilitate the creation of any styles of animation, including traditional frame-by-frame animation, key-frame animation, cut-out and photo animation.

No matter how much you know about computers or animation, everyone can use Toon Boom Studio. Learn how to use Toon Boom Studio quickly with our free video tutorials, online articles and sample projects or discuss with experts in our user forum.
