,Oldmamaload,2007-09-05T23:00Z,Please seed!!!!
,Kingofthesouth904,2007-09-09T18:50Z,How do I get pass the part were I enter a serial number. I dont understand the instructions. Can someone help me out.
,Maverick_83,2007-09-11T22:44Z,Totally worthless. I have tried both mounting the discs in Daemon tools and burning them to cd:s and as soon as the program wants disc2 in both cases it wonÂ´t find the damn second disc. Waste of time so far if someone dosenÂ´t have a solution to the problem??
,Donnerwetter,2007-09-14T13:47Z,"Same problem
Stops after inserting disc 2"
,danragn,2007-09-15T18:25Z,Stannar efter man satt i andra CD.n .. Fungerar inte!!!!
,SonOfGates,2007-09-27T19:02Z,ok ive found a workaround for both the problems mentioned... first copy the Bin directory from the first CD into any folder on your hard drive then copy the Bin directory from CD 2 into that same folder and click yes at the prompt to overwrite files. Run the Setup.exe in \Bin\acadFeui\ and you wont be prompted to change CDs.  Then  enter 000-00000000 for the serial number when installing and apply the crack per the instructions when its done installing.

,xandres,2007-10-08T20:36Z,downloading and extracting worked perfect. ( just put both discs in one map ) For first registration i used 000-000000. This opened the autocad program. BUT it is a trial version. It only works 30 days. they asked me for a validation key... where cna i find that???
,george17,2007-10-12T13:09Z,"ok very goog thank you

good work"
,george17,2007-10-12T14:42Z,thanl you sonOfgates

,tiny40505,2007-11-01T21:01Z,I did the same thing as was told. But mine was also listed as a 30 day free trial. Please explain how to get rid of this. Thanks
,Lordless,2007-11-02T02:09Z,Beautiful workaround. Thanks
,AndreasxRcok,2007-11-05T23:38Z,111-20111111 validation key
,kld09483,2007-11-20T07:51Z,That validation key doesn't work.  I've copied the dll files but the trial period is still counting down.  Any suggestions?
,Lauz_7,2007-11-20T19:43Z,"I have a strange problem with this program. When i start it, it runs fine and everything, but when i go to the scrollborad/icon for ""File"" in the program, the program shuts down and an error massage occurs. The massage is as follows ""FATAL ERROR: unhandled e06d7363h exeption at 764av09eh"". Any suggestions about this problem?  I'd like to save my projekts..."
,mvorass,2007-11-21T03:16Z,"how would one get around the activation code? i used the validation key mentioned earlier, and it said that the serial/ subscription group id wasn't valid.
or is there any other way to not have to re-install every 30 days?"
,Quirky_Puppy,2007-12-06T22:21Z,Does this work with Vista x64?
,bob51,2007-12-30T18:17Z,I have read all the comments. Has anyone got autocad 2007 to actually work for anything beyond the 30 day activation period??
,pyrogod,2008-01-04T13:38Z,"Tried everyway but can't get it to work. activation codes 655-12354321    /

and 688-69696969 don't work.
anybody got an activation code that works."
,odobo1,2008-01-07T11:07Z,Has anyone gotten this to work beyond the 30 day trial period?
,wayaaa,2008-01-23T21:09Z,"After completing the steps proposed by SonofGates, simply copy the dll's located in the crack folder of disk 1 and paste it in the program directory, usually c:/program files/autocad 2007. Overwrite when asked"
,XistentialX,2008-02-01T07:37Z,"I tried to copy and it wouldnt let me, it said that the file already exists and i have to have a new file name, I cant get the code for the actual version"
,movieznmuzic,2008-02-20T02:44Z,"I followed sonofgates directions whiched fixed the cd 2 problem, then copied the two files from the crack folder in cd 1 into the program directory, overwriting the two files already in there and the program works perfect. It is the full version and not the trial. It took me a while to get it all working, but if you do everything right it should work no problem."
,zzznm,2008-03-10T21:40Z,"You guys i found a really cool website  CAD2008 english with activation crack here:

http://heyloll.com and click on cool programs at the top

its a super fast download too, just sharing with you guys its 10 bucks but its worth it.... there are also instructions on how to install it :) WORKS I TESTED REALLY NICE"
,darrencarr,2008-03-25T15:21Z,"Thanks to gambireiro for the torrent and SonofGates for the install instructions. Works better than my legit copy, lol."
,william9366,2008-04-02T14:07Z,"for everyone having trouble getting past the 30 day trial version, heres what i did. i noticed that when i extracted the 2 files from the cracked folder into the acad program directory it copied them into another cracked folder. simply take the 2 files out of that folder and put them in the acad program directory and it will ask if you want to overwrite the existing files. do it, and your copy should work. good luck."
,vlsh,2008-04-03T06:29Z,"I've downloaded 3 AutoCAD programs and finally this one works perfectly per SonofGates Instructions.  Since I just installed it I don't know if I will run into the 30 day trial period problem yet.. I hope not because I replaced the 2 cracked .dll files.  I will post again if any problems occur .. so far so good.
THANKS!"

,MZ68,2008-10-01T11:17Z,"Thanks!! After following the instructions of copy, paste and overwrite the Bin-files and the 2 dll files the way here was told, serial 000-00000000, everything works perfect!!!
I don't know for sure if it's still a trial-version, but it's not shown anyware, so I don't think so.

Now I wonder if I can remove some files so I can safe some space. By copying the Bin-files it's all doubled and that takes a lot of space. Can I just remove the Bin from disk 1 and 2, cause they're in the new map now?

Thanks!
Marjan"
,MZ68,2008-10-01T11:32Z,"Or after installing everything, can I just remove the folders Disk 1 and 2 and the new map for the Bin folder?
Maby a stupid question...but I'm not sure...

Thanks again...
Marjan"
,m.basso,2008-10-19T20:21Z,"It works. I've tested, and it works perfectly.

If you have doubts about the instalation, just follow these steps, as said by SonofGates:

first copy the Bin directory from the first CD into any folder on your hard drive then copy the Bin directory from CD 2 into that same folder and click yes at the prompt to overwrite files. Run the Setup.exe in \Bin\acadFeui\ and you wont be prompted to change CDs. Then enter 000-00000000 for the serial number when installing and apply the crack per the instructions when its done installing.

After the instalation, all you have to do is copy the files on the Crack's directory and put at the instalation's directory, clicking YES to overwrite the existing files.

,dmoss9987,2008-10-25T19:39Z,WOW....ITS REALLY WORKS...JUST FOLLOW SONOFGATES INSTRUCTION AND COPY THE TWO FILE FROM THE CRACK AND PASTE IT ON THE PROGRAM DIRECTORY TO CHANGE IT FROM TRIAL VERSION TO FULL VERSION

,LesT3R,2008-11-15T15:41Z,hi.. can anyone tell me with what am i going to open these 2 files? do i need to burn it in CDs first? thanx..
,rebelmusik,2008-11-18T03:49Z,"anyone know if these two .dll files will work with another version of autoCAD 2007, not the one provided in this torrent?

I have a 30 day trial going right now, if I just use these .dll files to replace the other ones in the program directory, you think my version of autoCAD 2007 would become fully functioning as well?"
,saplehed,2009-03-19T04:25Z,Got it up and running.  Thanks to SonofGates for the further instructions listed.  And of course thank you Gambireiro for the torrent!
,vevenaneathna,2009-07-30T09:28Z,"Having trouble

I downloaded this and another 2008 version of autoCAD
torented fine, no unpacking for the ISO's
mounted once with daemon tools
wouldnt open or auto run so i copyed what was inside the mounted folder to a normal folder on my desktop and added the bin to it from the second ISO i mounted.
I installed it fine but it wont open.

when i run it, my CPU usage goes to 100% and it runs under processes and I am unable to do anything to it. There is no window that opens and I have tried restarting my computer.


I cannot burn the ISO's to a CD either because Nero (what im trying to use) wont allow me to select anything but the image writer to burn the ISO's to my CD.

I doubt i should have to burn the ISO's if I mount them right? But whats up with the auto run not working on the mounted drives, or me getting to the point where others say it works perfectly, and it wont open at all for me.

help :\"
,newbie700,2011-01-21T03:46Z,"1. Unzipped using 7-zip (free n easy)

2. Installed using setup (on cd1) into Programs on my c: drive.

3. Used the 000-00000000 number.

4. Discovered i HAD to tick the EXPRESS TOOLS and MATERIALS LIBRARY box when asked otherwise got hundreds of ""file not found make have you got access?"" error messages.

5. Copied the .dll files in Crack Folder and pasted into the (new) Autocad Folder in Programs.  YES to overwrite.  
****************************************
Seems to be working though I don't know how to use it yet!! LOL.
Thanks to Gambireiro and all advice.

p.s don't think I needed cd 2 - just for burning to cd perhaps?
