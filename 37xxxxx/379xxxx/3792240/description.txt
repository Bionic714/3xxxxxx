Mediocre movie Delta Farce now avaliable in DVDRip quality courtesy of group iMBT! Quality is great both in image and audio departments. I suggest you grab this if you want some cheap laughs or nothing to engaging. Not something you have to warm up your brain to enjoy, im sure some will find it an enjoyable hour and a half.

Plot: Whitney, Engvall and a third Blue Collar stand-up comic will play inept, Iraq-bound Army reservists who are mistakenly dropped into Mexico and liberate a small village from marauders. Down on his luck after losing his job and his girlfriend on the same day, Larry decides to join his neighbor, Bill (Bill Engvall), and his combat-happy buddy, Everett (DJ Qualls), for a relaxing weekend of drinking and target practice. But when the three hapless guys are mistaken for Army Reservists by the hard-nosed Sergeant Kilgrove (Keith David), they?re loaded onto an army plane headed for Fallujah, Iraq - and mistakenly ejected in a Humvee somewhere over Mexico.
