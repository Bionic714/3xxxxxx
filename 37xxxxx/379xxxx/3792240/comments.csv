Or people that are with the anti-piracy group or whatever the hell they call them selves. Anyways they send down loaders bad packets and files, wasting your bandwidth and they also log your ip usually. Try using BlueTack. They block ips known to be used by anti-piracy people. Here is a faq on how to get it done.
