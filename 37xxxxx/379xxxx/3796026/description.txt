The troubles begin for the Wyrick family when their three-year-old daughter Heidi begins spending time with her new invisible friend, a kindly old Mr. Gordy. The family eventually realizes there's more to Mr. Gordy than just a child's active imagination. Heidi awakens one night with claw marks on her face and her father Andy soon suffers the same scratches on his back. Mr. Gordy is no longer the only apparition; he's joined by a hooded, faceless figure and a man with one hand. The family contacts a parapsychologist who attributes the manifestations to energy from a fault-line. Later, a psychic tells them of several spirits in the home, some being good and some being evil. Eventually, they turn to their church for help. Afterwards it seems that the Wyricks' are at peace in their home once again. However at the end of the program, Heidi claims that she sometimes still sees one of the spirits, one that is always black. At the end Heidi plays the piano it is a somewhat ominous peaceful tune.
