The Veil: Heidi Wyrick's Story by Joyce S. Cathey and Rebecca S. Harrington (Paperback - April 3, 2007)

ThePirateBay won't let me post the link to anything on Amzon but you should be able to find it from that.

Here is a newer pic of her and a little about her and the Gordy house. Search on google:
Heidi Wyrick James Gordy house
Its the top link.

Thepiratebay hates links.  It won't let me post this one either."
