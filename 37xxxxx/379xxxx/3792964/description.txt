As you might have told, this release probably isn?t really about the program, its to report some scene news. CFF (Cracking For Fun) have reached their 1000th release, a VERY nice milestone for a very professional group. As they say 342 of those releases were with a keygen, which is a fair effort I think. So congrats to CFF, and here is the 1000th release.
