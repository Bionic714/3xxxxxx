Adobe Photoshop 7.0

works fine, and I've been really happy with it.


I got two rules:

1. Seed after Downloading, at least 24 hours or more. I seed the first few days after uploading, and some other times.
2. Behave well, and don't write shit as comments. And help those who need it.



Many thanks, Eirik312Â¤#
