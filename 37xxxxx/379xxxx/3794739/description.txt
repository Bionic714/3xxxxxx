SUMMARY

This classic story by Margery Williams, published in 1922, imparts the
timeless message that toys need not be expensive or modern to be
appreciated. Through giving and receiving love, even a commonplace
stuffed animal can become real in the eyes of a child. This recording,
read by a mother and daughter, is dedicated to Barbara Bear, who is
real.
