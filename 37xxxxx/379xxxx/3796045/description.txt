These are a little pet project of mine, the first being inspired by a 14 hour fight with insomnia... it one.

The basic premise, to enjoy a buckloads of songs, without wastin time listeing to the whole track.

You ever been to a party or in a car, and there is that one dude messing around listening to 30 seconds of each song... That\\\\\\\'s me.

Anyway, enjoy, and/or pass these on.  They are trult labours of love of mine.
