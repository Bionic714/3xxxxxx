,jook11,2007-10-09T07:40Z,This file is still stuck at 98.2%. I've been there for days. Can't someone seed for a while so we can finish it?
,jook11,2007-10-09T07:53Z,"Got this figured out. The file torrent is about 96% the same as the one here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3723785/Rainbow.Six.Vegas.%5BMULTI5%5D%5BPSP%5D.
Load that torrent, then stop it, delete it's data file, and try to restart it - it won't work, but then you can resource the target to this ISO, and it will load up at about 96%. Then it will be able to finish."

,713tex,2008-09-11T00:00Z,"@ DocWallabee

CSO's are just compressed ISO's. I compress all my ISO's for smaller file size.

@  96mike96

Why did you extract files from the ISO?
Just place the ISO in the ISO folder."
,dlanor16,2008-09-16T07:09Z,"Can you please help me, how do you put it in PSP? sorry for being ignorant. just wanna learn"
,r1887,2008-09-30T17:05Z,And how are you supposed to get this into your psp?
,r1887,2008-09-30T19:09Z,Everyone who don't know how to put it on to the psp. Make a folder named ISO (capital letters) in the root of you psp. Put the game in there. you don't need to extract anything at all.
