,UltraBrazil,2008-10-18T05:50Z,"Just like your upload of Der Todesking, this movie HAS NO SOUND."
,strahlfort,2010-07-07T11:10Z,"can someone confirm that it actually has sound? I mean, I assume it does and UltraBrazil just had incorrect codecs..."
,anon_16,2012-02-03T17:12Z,"CONFIRMED.
Sound is there and of good quality.
But it disappears if you move the seek bar.
So watch it in one shot, if you want the sound."
