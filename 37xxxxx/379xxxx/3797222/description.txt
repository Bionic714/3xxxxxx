BAD BRAINS Live at CBGB 1982 (total running time 60 minutes) 5.1 surround sound.

On christmas eve 1982, Bad Brains began their three-day stint at a Hardcore festival hosted by legendary CBGB.
This dvd represents the very best of these shows, culled from over 4 hours of footage. Their live performance were legendary, their visual recordings were impossible to find. 
Now, for the first time on dvd, that powerful performance is revisted in extraordinary fashion.


Enjoy ! / Peter Ramone
