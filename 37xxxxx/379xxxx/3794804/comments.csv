,Exoddus,2007-09-06T04:05Z,"The QFG series is my absolute favorite in the adventure genre! Your a god Lunaa! ^^
Just one question. Is this one of the sierra collections that has recently been officialy released for XP or just a rar with all the games?"
,Lunaa,2007-09-06T05:03Z,Its actually a copied image of an older anthology CD that came out in the mid to late ninties. It even has the voice version of number 4. :)
,Exoddus,2007-09-07T07:47Z,"Wow! I did not even know there was a voice version of it! My favorite game of all time since childhood actully had voice...
I've tried it out a little and i'm almost scared. The voice ruins the imaginary voices i've been hearing all my life lol. This makes a complete new experiance of the game. Thanks again ^^"
,Lunaa,2007-09-08T01:53Z,"Hehe cool. :)  I'm probably gonna put QFG V up this weekend, so it will be complete. "
,Robfan,2007-09-14T01:07Z,FINALLY! Thank you so much Lunaa...I had the voiced version waaay back but lost it. All the versions I've found throughout the years have been without. Finally I can complete this game! Peace!
,hoyhoybuloy,2007-09-25T03:39Z,is it just me? or is the file corrupt?
,budskee420,2007-11-24T11:21Z,"TY sooo much lunaa as doom was my very first first person shooter (well actually wolfenstein 3d was) this was my first ever adventure game, shadows of darkness was such an awesome game with great story and voice acting. funny thing is ive never beat it and i have been wanting to go back to the good ol quest for glory days. thank you so much man i am getting a killer download speed. i actually won the game in an ebay auction 2 years ago but my brother lost it :/. man i wish oh how i wish sierra would completely remake the QFG series and even make a new one. ahh man cant thank you enough for keeping this seeded. you are my number one. :)"
,Bonzohazard,2008-02-26T21:10Z,"Lunaa, Whereabouts is that QFG5?  This was my favorite series ever and I could never find number 5.  In fact, I even have my OLD import data on a 3.5!"
,jgblanchette,2008-04-10T16:38Z,"Hi Lunaa - 

Thanks for uploading this torrent, unfortunately when i run setup off the disc (in Vista) I hear the midi jingle, but the setup window doesn't appear. I can see a ""Sierra On-Line help"" button in bottom of the screen, but im unable do do anything with it. Any ideas?

Thanks"
,cronicclapper,2008-05-13T18:49Z,Well I hope this goes fast because these are four of the greatest games ever.  I can't wait to play 2 again.  So much hidden stuff on that one.  The VO 4th is awesome.  I remember buying this pack back when I was in like 9th grade.  And when I fired of Shadows it was freaking awesome to hear those voices.  But like Exoddus said it did mess with the voices I had in my head.  But I remember playing it then thinking all games need to be like this.  And if anyone can find the game Sword of Shanara its freaking awesome like these.  Not as good but still a great adventure game.  This is a great UPLOAD I will comment on my download speeds soon.
,JessieEB79,2008-06-20T21:31Z,"This works.  For me, Shadows of Darkness is the only game that will install from the disc -- for the other games, I had to move the files to a folder on my hard drive and turn off ""read only.""  

Luckily, the patches for the infamous game errors are still available online, along with codes for the copyright protectors (i.e. the science formulas in SoD)."
,Lunaa,2008-06-23T02:07Z,Wow I had to move overseas and finally got my comp back; good to see this torrent still going. :) I will now to continue to seed as much as possible.  LONG LIVE QFG!
,irodrigo,2008-11-18T13:21Z,"How can I convince you to seed ""Rise of the Dragon"" again?

It's my favorite game ever. You'd be my hero."
[T],cdesade,2008-12-20T08:27Z,"I used to have QFG 1 and 4 on old 3.5"".  Lost them a few years ago. I'm so psyched to see that I can play them again (at least QFG 4) - favorite game ever).

Look, I'm dumb. I have no idea what to do with these files. I'm still running Win2000. Could someone give me a quick user-friendly tutorial?

It was 15 years ago this Christmas that I got Shadows of Darkness. Last time I left off I remember getting past the castle gates and into the room of the litlle girl with a doll.

PLEASE! I have to complete this game :)"
,old_MAD_7,2008-12-31T09:20Z,"Excellent!!!
THANKS!!! ;-)"
,dlnp22,2009-01-01T22:05Z,"Can someone lend a guy a hand? I've downloaded, converted to ISO(there were two files .mdf and .mds- I only used the larger .mdf file), and burned to disc with an ISO burner program. When I open the disc, I see ALL the files, but can't get ANY of them to open/install. Can anyone help a guy in need? I was a Sierra On-Line FREAK and seeing this torrent made me drool last week. I just HAVE to get these games working again!! :) "
,dlnp22,2009-01-03T02:37Z,"n/mind..figured it out. I SUCK at this stuff, but found a (semi) easy way to get this sucker running on Vista.  Download torrent, use something like iso burner(do a search for it), to convert to ISO(select the .mds file in iso burner). Once you have the ISO, burn it to disc, and then go here- http://vogons.zetafleet.com/viewtopic.php?t=8933&sid=c1b850aae3e113fff25105eb776b8e06 and follow directions- CAKE"
,fatwalrus,2009-05-02T16:04Z,"I remember having a copy of quest for glory 1 on 5 1/4 disks about 16 of them. Back then it was called Heroes quest before the company renamed the series. 
Great upload but I gave never completed number 4 because of bugs. Anyone know if number 4 works properly? 
I vaugly remember the problem happening in the swamp area.. and another bug messing up the part with the ras..something (dead chick in the swamp)

I mean has anyone actually finished it with this copy? I just dont want to play through 1 then 2 then 3 all over again just to find it still crashes in 4."
,Comoxian,2010-12-15T05:53Z,Where can I find this for mac?
,Socialism,2011-07-25T18:17Z,"Just FYI, this is the second comment I've ever written on a torrent site. I will download and seed these games FOREVER - it was my favorite growing up and I want others to be able to enjoy it the way I did.

Thanks for putting this up!"
