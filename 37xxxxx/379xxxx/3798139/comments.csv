All works great. Using Vista SP1.

"
,Beatrice5,2008-03-25T03:03Z,"This process worked for me:

Install Medal Of Honor Airborne with the KEYGEN from the HATRED folder on the Medal Of Honor Airborne.iso disc but DO NOT install (copy) the Hatred Crack.

Instead UPGRADE to 1.1 by opening the ""Medal Of Honor Airborne Update 1.1 [dopeman]"" folder and following the instructions below. (verified, this works):


  A 5 step process. Follow carefully.


 #1 Open folder 'Original_exe' and copy the two files to the game folders following path:

    Medal of Honor Airborne\UnrealEngine3\Binaries -and choose YES to overwrite.


 #2 Right-Click and choose to open file 'setup.reg' with NOTEPAD.

    CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE TO MATCH WHERE YOU HAVE PLACED THE GAME FOLDER:    
    ""Install Dir""=""C:\\Medal of Honor Airborne""

    BE SURE to leave the double \\ between each path.
    EXAMPLE: If you placed the game in your programs folder, you would change the line to read:

    ""Install Dir""=""C:\\Program Files\\Electronic Arts\\Medal of Honor Airborne""

    After correctly making change, save your change, THEN double-click 'setup.reg' to enter
    the changes to your registry. (Windows XP and Vista might be different but basically the same)


 #3 Now run 1.moha.dl.0.1081_Patch.exe to update the game.

 #4 Copy the new 1.1 Crack exe to your Medal of Honor Airborne\UnrealEngine3\Binaries folder
    and choose yes to overwrite.


 #5 Play the game. -v.1.1

What happens is that when I unpack the the .rar file I only get a new .rar file and this contains a lot of different maps and fils. I have tryed to just mount the Second .rar file in deamon tools, and this works. but when I try to install it does fire up. I get past the tab where I type the generated key(witch types it self) and I choose a language(English) and it starts. but then it just stops. and nothing happens. no look up or anything. I can see a window black window that opens for a blink of a second and disappers again. how do I solv this?"

,mvfreeman,2010-10-09T19:38Z,"I had the same problem as a  Defender7. I think that if you have the latest nvidia drivers you have a newer version of physx than what the game is trying to install. No point in rolling back to an earlier version so I dl'd dopeman's RIP. 
I did not install the physx, vredist, or directx it came with, since they are all already on my system from either newer games or nvidia. 
I have an AMD 4200+ dual core @2.21Ghz, 2gigs of RAM and a Nvidia 9600GT 512 card.
Dopeman's version started right up. There are still a few people seeding his v1.1 patch. I applied it and havent had any problems yet."

Let me phrase it the other way: if people need to have additional 6.5 gigs of space for the unpacked files, they are more likely to remove the torrent files just after downloading them. If the torrent contained unpacked file, it will be much easier to seed it."
