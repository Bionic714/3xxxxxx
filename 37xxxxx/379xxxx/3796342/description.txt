The one for connoisseurs.

The film is based on the old Serbian epic song. It is one of not too many Yugoslav films with medieval 14 century theme, so only for that, for me, it would be worth a look.

Dragan Nikolic is brilliant as Vlah Alija, with no other than Franco Nero as Banovic Strahinja. Rade Serbedzija is exceptional as a crazy dervish and the scene where he is tortured on the pike is more than powerful.
