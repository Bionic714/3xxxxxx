,DocWallabee,2007-09-05T12:45Z,Game is NTSC English Full Rip
,DocWallabee,2007-09-05T17:20Z,"I found 2 other torrents of this game...1 was PAL and the other was a .cso which was a partial rip.  Mine is the full rip.  So instead of writing stupid ass comments, keep the shit to yourself and find another full rip.  Otherwise, just say thanks for the upload."
,soppy1291,2007-09-08T21:42Z,"hey, this might be a dumb question but how do you make these work on your psp. do you just put the iso on a memory stick and play?"
,DocWallabee,2007-09-09T13:46Z,"You need to have a custom firmware installed on your PSP. Mine is 3.40 oe-a.  You can run homebrew like Super Nintendo and Nintendo and even have custom icons.  Once you have a custom firmware installed, just format the memory stick and you will then have a folder called ISO on the memory stick.  Just drag and drop .cso or .iso files in there.  The Homebrew goes in a different folder.  check this site out.  www.pspscene.net  That will help anyone who wants to know.  Enjoy."
