Supernova chronicles the search and rescue patrol of a medical ship in deep space in the early 22nd century and its six-member crew which includes a captain and pilot (Robert Forster), a co-pilot (James Spader), a medical officer (Angela Bassett), a medical technician (Lou Diamond Phillips), a search and rescue paramedic (Robin Tunney), and a computer technician (Wilson Cruz). When their vessel, the Nightingale 229, answers an emergency distress signal from a comet mining operation in a distant galaxy, the crew soon finds itself in danger from the mysterious young man (Peter Facinelli) they rescue, the alien artifact he's smuggled aboard, and the gravitational pull of a giant star about to go supernova.
