Spider-Man 3 - Not So Lame Version

It's a DVD rip. The quality is good and it's NOT a theater copy.

The original was too long and really lame. My version cuts out a half hour of footage that was either pointless to have in the movie or was just plan lame. It's still not perfect and that\'s why I call it the Not So Lame Version. I couldn't get rid of all the lame, but this makes the movie better.

- Mary Jane and Peter back stage after Mary Jane's show
