Dave Chappelle takes the stage with his own blend of observant, laid-back comedy in this 60 minute stand-up special which originally aired on HBO in 2000. Dave takes on the police, racism, Sesame Street, the government, and more in the smart, hilarious way that has led him to his position as one of America's top comedians.
