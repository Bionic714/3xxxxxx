It's Bin 12 months from the last release (WW v2.0), and thank god, it waz well received by the general public, ranging from newbies, amateurs to Pros and Geeks! , I've received a couple of hundred emails, mostly personal experiences, opinions, suggestions, productive criticisms to reach the perfection as much as possible
