Remember to play it safe with activation!"
,apeiron69,2007-09-03T17:31Z,Please nothing that works for encore cs3 ?
,whertigo,2007-09-05T08:09Z,"This keygen generates valid serial numbers, but NOT activation codes. Not for me anyway, I had to use the good ol' master collection keygen minus the last four digits to activate my suite."
,Uber_nova,2007-09-07T13:49Z,hey has this release's licenses expired for anyone?  Thanks 
,Vathral,2007-09-08T04:31Z,"You guys that can't activate it are doing it all wrong!

This does indeed create a serial number. You then choose activate by phone, paste the request code Adobe gives you to the generator and click Generate Activation.

I have a full license using this keygen. For you guys having trouble, make sure you delete the cache.db file before trying to activate. Unplug your modem as well."
,spade0013,2007-09-11T05:13Z,"@ Vathral:  How do you get the Activation code then? I gave the automated phone my serial, but it asked for activation code as well."
,kindred,2007-09-11T10:02Z,"All The Adobe CS3 keygens are suspicious. I downloaded both the master and production keygens. The production keygen seems Ok and creates a working key but I noticed it copies itself to c:\windows\prefetch and system restore.

The master keygen definitely has a trojan (Backdoor.Win32.Rbot.gen), even though Kaspersky internet suite 7. nod32, avg anti spyware, and outpost 4 didn't detect anything. Try running it to see what I mean. Only then do the anti virus scanners detect it, but by then it's too late as it's already written to your registry and c:\windows directory and creates a file called WTemp_01.exe. :(

Doesn't look any of the best Anti-virus scanners can yet detect this trojan, so be careful."
,spade0013,2007-09-16T00:29Z,"So, is there no way to use the keygen if you downloaded a trial?"
,galvanisedoil,2007-11-20T04:26Z,Where can I find the cache.db file?
,branda1987,2008-05-20T16:10Z,"anyone know why i keep gettin this msg when the install is done

,daxyn,2008-09-02T21:52Z,I am new to this - but I downloaded four .uif files and now I do not know what to do to install the programs. 
,ReallyBadNightmare,2008-10-18T16:40Z,"Seems like it really is trojan and virus free!

The master keygen definately has a trojan though. My ani-virus blocked it."
