MP2TSME Overview

Manzanita System's MP2TSME is a full-featured offline multiplexing software application. MP2TSME accepts the widest variety of input streams, including H.264 / AVC / MPEG-4 video. It also supports creation and multiplexing of DVB, ATSC, and user-defined tables. 

Its proven multiplexing core technology and powerful tool kit has made it the number one choice for a wide range of professional applications such as video-on-demand, digital video broadcasting, post-production and MPEG equipment manufacturing.

This is a FULLY FUNCTIONAL version of the program. To get around the trial

time limit you must set your computer's date a few years into the future. If it

doesn't work keep setting it a few years ahead until it does. You must do this

everytime you start the program. Slightly inconvenient but it works.
