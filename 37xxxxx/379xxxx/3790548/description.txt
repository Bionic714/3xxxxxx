In the spirit of the movie: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Pay It Forward.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I put together a compilation of various movies, tv documentaries, and websites that have helped me better understand multiple forms of addition & multiple recovery options & possible cures!

I encourage anyone who has addiction problems, their friends, & family to download & share/seed AT LEAST 2 copies of this collection to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Pay Forward\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to people in need who my find this information beneficial - Then, indirectly, we may all help save someone\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s life and/or family! :)

Here\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a list of the shows on this compilation.  You can get details on them at the excellent: IMDB.com website.  There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s also additional info on this compilation which I purposely made about the size of a single-layer DVDR in case you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d like to burn it for someone.

Thanks in advance for sharing! :)
