Do you think you could start seeding it again soon? Right now we're stuck at 7.3%, and I can't wait to finish it!  Thanks again!"

,heartbraden,2007-09-12T22:33Z,"I'll seed as much as I possibly can, which is most of the time.  Every night, and most of the time during the day.  If you want a particular album or albums, then you can either comment here or send me an IM @ HeartBraden, or msn @ thrillville@msn.com"
,mvernon,2007-09-13T17:36Z,"Nice One!

Only question is WHY DID YOU RAR THE THING?  Are you crazy, sadistic, or just poorly informed?  Surely you must have way more disk space than you know what to do with.  I mean if you have 130GB of music on your computer, then you RAR it up, its going to take 260GB total.  Every leecher who downloads this is going to need 260GB of FREE DISK SPACE just to even think about downloading this since you cannot unrar an individual file in this torrent.  You also could not unrar this torrent unless each and every bit of it completes perfectly, which at 500kb/sec will take at least 700 hours, and thats if the torrent works PERFECTLY!  

I'd LOVE to see you repost this sucker without it being RAR'd so we can all pick and choose which albums we want....."
,heartbraden,2007-09-14T06:41Z,"I'm neither crazy, sadistic, nor poorly informed.  The fact is... if I hadn't rar'ed it, (which I tried first), the torrent takes up over 4 MBs... which TPB, Mininova, and most, if not all other torrent sites, won't allow... so it simply cannot be done, unless you wish to upload them all in separate torrents.  And in this age, 260 GB is really not that insane... You will only need to have the space to unrar it... then you can trash the .rar files.  I have a TB external, so that's what I used."
,Larppamo,2007-09-14T13:30Z,"This is a huge! Thanx a lot! I'll download this and WILL seed this if someone else wants too download this. I have to say, this is huge maybe too huge but luckuly I have 4 big hard discs so space wount come full. :)"
,phaelo,2007-09-14T18:30Z,"He is nothing like that, by uploading everything as one big rar archive it ensures (to a degree) it gets seeded well, we need to figure out how to get a couple people seeding this faster. I've been working with heartbraden and our attempts have improved the speed but not by much. Ideas?"
,mvernon,2007-09-14T22:35Z,"My mistake.  Also, I just picked up a 500GB seagate drive for $130 - so you're right the size by itself is not a big deal.  I did not realize TPB has a maximum .torrent file size of 4MB, which really sucks.  I guess I will download this and attempt to help seed it."
,mvernon,2007-09-14T22:40Z,"I guess I'm the one thats poorly informed.

Still, I fail to see how RARing the sucker ensures it will get well seeded.  Most torrent users, at least in my experience, hardly ever turn off torrents after they have downloaded them.  Even if they only download some of the files in a torrent, those files are still going to be shared, and almost always the only files that anyone will skip are the real esoteric ones no one's ever heard of and will almost never listen to.  I think in fact, being able to pick and choose the files you actually want makes better use of everyones bandwidth since we don't have to download and upload pieces that we will never do anything with.  Comments?"
,heartbraden,2007-09-15T06:28Z,"mvernon - Yes, it would make better use of bandwidth... and that would make a better torrent... however, that still doesn't change the fact that it can't be uploaded here or Mininova... so for now we're stuck with this... but you can always delete the albums you don't want to keep."
,thekoobie,2007-09-16T01:11Z,"I think things are going well, it's going to take a while to get started, but it is worth the wait. "
,mvernon,2007-09-17T16:48Z,"heartbraden - I appreciate your response.  I doubt that I will delete any albums - unless perhaps there are some particularly irritating ""Christian Rock"" songs in there.  I personally like all varieties of music (except the aforementioned type - which I consider non-music).

Just out of curiosity, if you set the piece size to maximum (which I see you have for this torrent), do you have any idea of the maximum amount of data that can be described in a 4MB torrent?  In other words approximately how many torrent files would you need to create if you had not RAR'ed this torrent?"
,mvernon,2007-09-17T17:01Z,"(a continuation of my previous post)

Come to think of it, how much compression did you gain by RARing the already compressed MP3 files?  I imagine the original 2,313 albums must have taken about 130GB, no?

As a software developer, this whole discussion makes me think about the format of the .torrent file, and perhaps it could be compressed using a simple lz compression algorithm.  This also makes me wonder if the BitTorrent protocol utilizes compression over-the-wire to make maximum use of bandwidth.  I see some investigation on my part is in order."
,heartbraden,2007-09-17T18:45Z,"mvernon - sorry... I'm not quite sure how much it got compressed.  I've since added several albums to my collection on my computer, and it would be difficult to tell exactly what it was before, without unrar'ing them all first... which I'll do, if you want me to."
,mvernon,2007-09-17T19:25Z,"heartbraden - don't worry about unRARing them - it's not really a big deal.  

On another note entirely, how fast is your internet connection?  This torrent shows that it was uploaded 17 days ago.  I can ""see"" about 15% of the torrent which means you have uploaded about 19GB, which seems quite quick really.  What torrent client do you use?"
,heartbraden,2007-09-19T18:42Z,"I don't have a great connection, but I'm privately torrenting pieces to someone who does... and I use utorrent."
,mvernon,2007-09-19T22:03Z,"reason I ask is I have a 10MB fiber connection that absolutely rawks, but I'm only getting little trickles of data.  I'm using uTorrent 1.7.5"
,phaelo,2007-09-19T22:56Z,"That is because there is a bottleneck because since only 1 person has all the files, once more people have it it will go quickly. This is a initial seeding of a large torrent, slowness can be expected."
,heartbraden,2007-09-19T23:52Z,"Mvernon - If you would like to help me seed this torrent, message me on AIM or MSN"
,mvernon,2007-09-21T19:50Z,heartbraden - I msg'd you on MSN but no reply so far.  Did you get consumed by a black hole or something?
,mvernon,2007-09-23T07:02Z,now I'm a little concerned that we may never see the entire RAR
,mvernon,2007-09-23T20:20Z,heartbraden - I see you're seeding again!  Cool!
,heartbraden,2007-09-25T05:24Z,"Sorry about the ""me dissappearing into a black hole"" thing, guys... I fell off of a building and broke two bones in my left hand, and have been in the doctors a lot the last few days... but I'm all right, and I'll be seeding from here on out.  And if anyone still wants to help seed, I'll be able to reply now."
,theLOG,2007-09-26T03:17Z,"Is anyone gonna seed, or is the dead.

,mvernon,2007-09-26T04:06Z,parkour?
,mvernon,2007-09-26T04:07Z,"anyway, sure I'd love to help you seed this thing... did you get my IP addresses via MSN?  if not, let me know I will send them again."
,mvernon,2007-09-26T17:12Z,"Once some of us actually get the entire torrent downloaded this thing is gonna fly!  I currently see at least 24 clients who are sitting at 19.6% with more added every day.

,heartbraden,2007-09-26T19:12Z,"Mvenon - yes, parkour.  About 45-50 are downloading at any given moment. And yes I got it.  I'll message you on that soon."

,mvernon,2007-10-14T17:29Z,"seeding is happening, although rather slowly, and by only a single individual since no entire copies exist in the cloud yet.  Considering this torrent is 125GB, you will not see quick progress.  This one is going to be a long haul."
,mvernon,2007-10-14T17:30Z,"heartbraden, is your uTorrent set to initial seed?"
,heartbraden,2007-10-14T20:05Z,"Yes, mvernon, it is set to Initial Seeding.  Once at least one more person has it... it'll go MUCH faster."

,Zeroes,2007-10-16T04:06Z,124gb in a torrent... is this a new record?
,mvernon,2007-10-19T14:24Z,"I just did a quick calculation; since it takes me about 40 minutes to walk to work and 40 minutes to walk home each day, and the average song is say 4 minutes long, I could listen to these songs for 5.8 years while walking to and from work and never listen to the same some twice...

,mvernon,2007-10-23T16:06Z,"You guys who are asking for seed - this torrent is still in the initial stages of being seeded by the original uploader.  Please be patient.  As soon as there is a single copy uploaded, the torrent will go MUCH faster, until then we just have to be patient. 
Sometimes the initial seeder will go offline, or appear to be offline, however that is soon rectified by him."
,mvernon,2007-10-23T16:09Z,"I know its not much, but each individual file in the torrent can be unRAR'ed giving about 160 songs each.  Presently there are several complete RAR files that can be extracted..."

,mvernon,2007-11-15T14:28Z,I seriously doubt these RAR's have any passwords.  I just opened number 119 - no password...
,mvernon,2007-11-15T14:39Z,"Heartbraden has his torrent client set to ""initial seed"" which means he appears to every client to have only a single available piece, and will only upload each individual piece once.  That way his connection is working at maximum efficiency - the reason this torrent is ""slow"" is that he does not have high upload bandwidth.  When I say ""slow"" I think that is a relative term since the Torrent is 128GB; even with HIGH upload bandwidth, this would not be quick to download ....  for instance if it was hosted on an OC192 network (the fastest internet backbones run OC-192) which is capable of almost 10Gbps (probably 100x faster than your standard home network) it would take almost 3 minutes to transfer.  Think about it - it's going to take a real long time just to unrar the thing never mind download..."
,mvernon,2007-11-15T14:42Z,"* my calculation implies that the connection between you and the seeder is OC-192 all the way through and there are no routers between you and the torrent seeder, which is of course impossible.  In reality it would likely take between 5 to 10 hours assuming you had 10Mbps fiber connection to the internet."

,mvernon,2007-12-04T14:00Z,"btw, the rest of you folks who have uTorrent set to initial seed mode - you probably don't want to do that since it will actually make the torrent less efficient at this point.  The little known fact about super-seeding or initial seeding is that the seeder will only upload a single piece to a specific peer until the seeder receives confirmation from another peer that the piece has been distributed beyond the peer that originally downloaded that piece.  The only peers that should run as ""initial seed"" are peers who actually have an entire copy of the torrent - i.e.: seeders"

TPB is reporting 3 seeders now? HB+Mars+?"
,-Andrfolk100-,2007-12-13T17:44Z,I don't understand... 52.5% and the download speed is stuck at 23kb/s. Shouldn't the speed be at least 150 kb/s when we have 3 seeders??  Pls help me!!! I want this torrent!!!
,Mars12343,2007-12-13T18:54Z,Its not 3 seeders its 2 seeders... and just fuckin chill... dont complain about having to wait for it... it will get there soon enough...
,heartbraden,2007-12-13T20:52Z,"I'm not sure why it says 3 seeders... there are only 2, unless someone came into my house while I was sleeping and took copied the music to an external hard drive or something.  :)

And Andrfolk100 - The reason it was so slow is because I wasn't seeding, as I've had a lot of problems with electricity cutting out, then 5 hours later I can start it again... but I assure you I'm getting it to you as quickly as possible."
,-Andrfolk100-,2007-12-13T21:27Z,"Thanks heartbraden!!!!! You'r the greatest!! Will you seed next week to because I'm away on the holiday =( I remember when the speed was at 2-300 kb/s, it was great times =)"

,mvernon,2007-12-19T19:52Z,"60.0%  Woooohooooo!  Thanks Heartbraden and Mars12343.

TPBs seeder count is notoriously bad.  Right now it says there are two seeders, even though there are actually no uTorrent machines in seed mode.  Go figure.  I guess it's more of an ""approximation"".  You can typically expect no more than 30 to 60kb/s on this torrent, and will only get higher speeds than that after the torrent is well seeded (think about 2 to 3 weeks from now)"
,mvernon,2007-12-19T20:04Z,"just to put everything into context - this torrent has been running for almost 4 months now.  There are only 2 complete copies of the data available.  If you download this torrent, you should be prepared to wait for at least several weeks for it to complete.  Several weeks from now there will likely be 10 to 20 complete copies being seeded by various peers around the globe, at which point you should be able to download the entire torrent in (gasp!) only about 2 weeks start to finish..."
,mvernon,2007-12-19T20:04Z,"""Aye Billy, she's a big one"""
,Mars12343,2007-12-20T05:09Z,Dude i NEVER stop utorrent its always running except for the occasional time i turn off my computer which is rare... so it ALWAYS has at least 1 seeder...
,mvernon,2007-12-20T15:43Z,"Mars12343, surely if you have uTorrent in super seed mode, it is not reporting that it is a seed?  Isn't that the entire point of super seed mode?  I'm not saying you are not seeding, just that it looks like nobody is seeding due the the fact you are running as a super seed..."
,Mars12343,2007-12-20T22:27Z,"Ok...  i didnt understand your comment... thought you where refering to ""Super Seeders"" as people in ""Seed mode"" "
,zite83,2007-12-22T19:13Z,aww man... finally 2 seeds and I'm at 50.8% and my NAS went down... I guess I will have to restart after I fix my server..  owell uploaded 49.2 GB for everyone :p
,beginner99,2007-12-24T05:40Z,"?  When did we get four seeders?  Thats a 2 man jump from 2 days ago. 

Now we're getting somewhere!!  Yeah!!


Question:  When complete should we run in super -seed mode or just regular seed-mode?"
,therobsta,2007-12-24T18:04Z,"Can you please seed Boys Night Out's, You Are My Canvas demo? Thanks!"
,mvernon,2007-12-24T20:20Z,"presently there are only 2 physical seed machines on the Internet.  Both are presently running in super-seed mode since that is the most efficient way to get a large torrent distributed.  Once the data is well distributed (you will see many more than 2 or 4 seeds - probably like 10 to 20) everyone should run the torrent in standard seed mode, including the two initial seeders...  (just my 2 cents worth)"
,mvernon,2007-12-24T20:21Z,I'm presently at 64.9% if anyone cares.

,heartbraden,2008-01-06T14:41Z,Hey guys... sorry I haven't been on in a while... my external drive with all the music crashed on me.  I'm going to try to have it repaired and save the data... but it'll take a while.  Sorry about that.. however.. I believe Mars12343 will continue to seed in my absence.  Again... sorry about that.
,Mars12343,2008-01-06T17:26Z,dude just be careful with who is repairing it... it may be someone who is very against copyright infringement...
,heartbraden,2008-01-07T05:08Z,"But then again... even if they are very against it... they have no jurisdiction to come into my home and see if I do, in fact, own all of those cds... therefore not allowing them to prove otherwise.  And I highly doubt a computer repair business is going to go through that much trouble to get the police involved in something they SUSPECT of infringement.  I could have easily bought all those cds, movies, and TV shows.  And software.  Eh?"

,jbrown456,2008-01-10T04:21Z,"to you guys who are seeding this,
how can you possibly do that?

do your isp's not set limits for you?

i'm in canada and have just about one of the best connections i can get in my area.. 

i have a bandwidth limit of 60GB combined upload and download per month.

If i go over that i have to pay more

Sure i can download lightning fast, but theres not much i can download with limits like that. and the wrost part is, thats one of the better isps around here

some of them are like 2gb a month combined up and down!"
,Mars12343,2008-01-10T14:08Z,My isp does not limit amount of traffic... but they do limit my speeds =( im supposed to get 768kbps up for my limit but they are only letting me get between 6 and 100 kbps... so im definately gonna talk to them about this...

,mvernon,2008-01-28T20:04Z,"I'm curious to know how you determine that there are ""fake"" uTorrents out there.  In my opinion there are no fake clients attached to this torrent.  There ARE a bunch of real clients ""stuck"", as some of you put it, at 89% (or whatever % we're at now).  Actually NO ONE IS STUCK!   AND AS FOR SEEDERS THERE IS ONLY ONE RIGHT NOW!.  And I can guarantee you won't see him listed as a ""seeder"" since he is ""initial seed"" or ""super seed"" mode and as such appears to have 0% complete.  If you read through the previous comments on this torrent you will understand how this works...  Thanks for you interest!"
,mvernon,2008-01-28T20:07Z,"Furthermore, if you think you are ""stuck"" you most likely don't understand that this torrent is quite slow right now since there is ONLY ONE SEED and the torrent IS HUGE!!!.  However, if you are patient, within the next couple of weeks there should be about 15 or more seeds... and the torrent will then go much faster.

PATIENCE IS THE KEY!"

,mvernon,2008-02-04T19:23Z,"btjakob - there is only a single seed at the present time.  However, the seed is set to ""initial seed"" or ""super seed"" mode, so you won't ever see ""seed"" listed in your client list.  Rest assured however that he is indeed seeding and will (hopefully) continue to do so for the next several weeks until this thing finishes.  1% in a couple of days is typical for this torrent right now.  It's been going since September 1 2007 - and the uploader (heartbraden) lost his hard drive and the entire contents of the torrent during this time.  Read the rest of the comments on this torrent for more info..."
,mvernon,2008-02-04T19:26Z,This torrent will forever be firmly planted in my mind as the biggest most incredible download ever.  Some peers have already uploaded 1TB plus to other peers.  I would even venture a guess and say with all likelyhood there has been 10TB+ data sent via uTorrent on just this single torrent -> and with only a single seeder!  History in the making right here right now!
,btjakob,2008-02-04T20:02Z,"mvernon - ok, thanks for the info. It just took me one week to get to over 75%, that's why I thought 1% in 3 days was slow....

I'm downloading and uploading at a 100kB/s each.

There are 2 or 3 seeders, but aren't always there, obviously.

I doubt heartbraden will let this thing die... right guys?

Anyhow, keep uploading at maximum capacity and the more people will have it quickly, therefor allowing you to get it faster yourself.

Just keep downloading! And don't leave us standing once you're done!"
,Mr.Fubar,2008-12-10T22:44Z,I won't. Tomorrow my service is upgraded to 1.5mbps upload. I only have a meger 1.5% of this file. Once I get more I'll blow the gates open.  Till then I'm seeing a few others. 
,Mr.Fubar,2008-12-10T22:53Z,Perhaps someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong then as I'm only getting about 1kbps on this while I have other torrents getting 100kbps.

,mvernon,2008-12-24T21:32Z,This torrent started to really shake in about 5 months after it was uploaded by heartbraden.  It took that long for the initial seed to take place.  5 Months!  Back in the day (way back then) we had about 5 or 6 real hard core people commenting on this thing.  It's nice to see that it's still alive - and it looks like Mars12343 is really to thank for that!

1.  I'm no longer seeding it, the hard drive with all of it on there crashed about a year ago.

2.  There are still seeds out there, but this torrent has been hit-and-quit so many times due to it's size that it is dying quickly.

3.  I .rar'ed the entire thing for one reason.  And that is because I tried it the other way first, and the .torrent file was MUCH too large to be uploaded here, amongst other places.

4.  Thanks again to the few seeders that have stuck with this.  Without you, this would have died a LONG time ago."
