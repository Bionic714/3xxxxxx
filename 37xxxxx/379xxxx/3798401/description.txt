Description taken from NGC.
"In the maximum-security prison world of murderers and rapists, they are the most feared. With nicknames like "The Beast" and "The Hulk," the warriors of The Aryan Brotherhood are the most violent criminals behind bars-men who strangle with their bare hands, shank guards, gouge out their enemies' eyes at the slightest sign of disrespect. We go behind bars to unveil the secrets of the vicious gang of white supremacists in prisons. Jailhouse interviews, surveillance footage that reveal their deadly tactics."
