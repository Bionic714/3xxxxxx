,Magpie13,2008-03-06T00:07Z,This is the only keygen ive found that works! 
,anthonyik,2008-03-11T23:26Z,I INSTALLED MASTER COLLECTION AND PUT IN THE WRONG ACTIVATION CODE AND NOW THE LICENSE IS EXPIRED. IS THERE A WAY TO PUT IN A NEW ACTIVATION CODE?
,fr0ntl1n3,2008-03-24T22:55Z,"WARNING - this app comes with JUST a keygen, the activation module is still active and prods you after about 5 launches to activate.
There is no phone-based activation keygen in the included crack.

Will someone from X-Force please address this?"

,learner1,2008-06-07T15:29Z,"please help im new to this, so basically download a 30 day triyal and when it finishes uses this keygen to use it for ever (is this right someone tell me pleaseeeeeeeeeee)"
,Volcanic-Penguin,2008-06-12T19:08Z,"Well. For me it didn't work any better than the keygen that came with my download of CS3 Master Collection. Green check when I put in the serial, still fails at activating, and in the phone activation the authorization code is invalid. "
,dannyjack816,2008-06-25T11:05Z,"thanks for this 
10/10 
no problem at all no virus unlike others"
,kmichael13,2008-07-06T07:15Z,"Downloaded just fine. 
Scanned and found it clean.
No problems installing.
No problem with entering serials number from keygen.
Could not activate.
Any ideas from XForce?"
,N3E,2008-08-05T12:14Z,Focking XForce to put in Virus and shit! Focking noobs!
,steevo89,2008-08-20T15:48Z,"I'm having the same problem penguin is having. I'm not entirely certain, but the most likely reason for the keygen not working on activation is because it's out of date relative to the software. This particular torrent has the matching build of CS3 that you need. It will work perfectly until the software updates itself. So install this build, and set your firewall to block the adobeupdater.exe. Better yet, just delete the damn thing from the registry. Hope this helps."
,steevo89,2008-08-20T20:38Z,"after wasted hours, 
i finally found the solution. it's an easy fix; you DON'T need to reinstall the software. 

open my computer
go to c:\documents and settings\all users
there's a hidden file called application data. open it.
delete the flexnet folder.
voila - you are now free to use your keygen."
,krakatica,2008-09-02T15:23Z,"if it tells you ""license has expired etc."" >> change the date of your system"
,jhgamer,2008-09-07T21:26Z,it worked for the master serial but after that it said regerstation unsusccsesfull and then you could do phone activation and i did and thats where the 2end part comes into play but when i put in the code it gave me it says its invallad please help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,moleygunn,2008-09-11T00:32Z,"This worked for me:

- Set your computer date to May 2007 (as darkassain says above)
- Delete the FlexNET folder (as steevo89 says above)
- Use the keygen and the activate over the phone option
- Run PS or DW or whatever.
- Close down PS or DW
- Change date back to what it should be.

Worked for me. Don't know if it'll last though!"
,skiz01,2008-09-20T14:04Z,"tried everything listed here, but still not working.  anyone else got any ideas, or links to cracks that are known to work?

cheers for the help guys!"
,kenai36,2008-09-23T11:59Z,This keygen actually works ive been looking for a couple of days now as the keygen with my copy won't open.  Thanks a lot.
,funkyman50,2008-10-12T07:36Z,"@ Moleygunn how do I get to the ""activate over the phone option""? 
And if I can find that, which key do I use?
Master Suite or OnLocation?"
,funkyman50,2008-10-12T07:42Z,"I got it! When it prompts you to activate click on ""other activation options"" and chose phone.
Then open up the keygen and copy paste the really long code in (5 digits per group not 4) into the request code box. Use the code the keygen gives you. It is working so for. Will repost if something comes up."
,creativelily16,2008-12-22T13:57Z,Ok after spending hours trying to activate i finally got it.  It actually works. go to the keygen and get the master suite serial.  launch one of the adobe programs and put in that serial.  Click activate by phone. it will give you the request code below the serial #.  Copy that request code into the keygen request code and click generate activation it will give you the authorization code which you put into the program that you opened.  Does that make sense? 
,Stekt_OrM,2008-12-28T00:02Z,Doesn't work for me
,allthewayinvolved,2009-02-11T20:23Z,It works. Serial #s and Activation Codes. All work. 2/11/09
,quantum0d0,2009-03-18T08:48Z,"3/17/09 - It works!  Thx!  All you have to do is enter the Master Suite Serial at beginning.  After install, when running the first app, select phone registration and use Activation Code from the Keygen.  ALSO - You have to set your System Clock back to between 2004 and 2007.  The only part that doesn't work for me is Soundbooth. Super Thanks, this is a very valuable learning tool."
,pols1337,2009-06-14T01:13Z,"Dear All,

This keygen works and I am successfully using Adobe Dreamweaver as we speak.  Valid as of June 13 2009.

Here's how it worked, and it follows word-for-word the instructions provided above by [creativelily16].  When you run Adobe Master CS3 for the very first time, you need the ""Master Suite Serial.""  Ignore the ""OnLocation Suite Serial.""  This should give you a green check and the install should proceed, reboot your computer, etc.

Now after reboot, you open up any one of the programs (Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Dreamweaver), you will be prompted for an Authorization.  Follow the options for alternative method of registering, or some shit like that, and opt for Telephone.  The program should tell you some request code (in addition to the original Master Suite Serial that you inputted).  Given that request code, use XFORCE's Keygen to get the Authorization Code.  And you're good to go.  

Note: I didn't have to set my clock back."
,pols1337,2009-06-14T01:14Z,Thanks XFORCE for unlocking the secrets to design heaven.
,Anonymous333,2009-08-02T07:18Z,Worked great for me! Thanks bro. Follw exactly what moleygunn said and it should work for you too.
