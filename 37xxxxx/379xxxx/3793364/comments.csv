I have been using the standard therapy starting at 1 drop of 35% food grade H202 in a glass of water three times a day, gradually increasing to 15 drops three times a day. And found it to be very helpful with chronic inflammation and infection. I have used it over the past 2 years pretty much all the time, varying the quantity to mirror my condition, so I can only speak for my own experience which was very positive. Read more before you use it. This ebook is very good"

,jackdaniels1972,2010-03-15T14:08Z,At the goatmaster: Your comment does nothing more than shout your ignorance to the world.  H202 has shown to be probably the greatest medical cure known to man.  Countless books have been written about it by medical Doctors.  Many studies have been done and I can tell you first hand that I had Hepatitis C for 10 years until I used H202 therapy.  Now after less than 1 year of therapy the Doctors can find no trace of the Disease in my body.  So shut up you ignorant Fuck!
