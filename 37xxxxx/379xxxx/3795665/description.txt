Cover Pack 002   NTSC   &   PAL

NTSC & PAL CD Size Wii Covers     Sept. 04 2007

I made these CD size Wii covers for the purpose of saving space.  
I use these covers in a large CD wallet rather than using my original DVD covers.

Do what you wish with these covers.  
Pirating games or any other media is illegal and just plain stupid.
Don't do it!

Please remember to seed after downloading and watch each month for an updated cover pack.
