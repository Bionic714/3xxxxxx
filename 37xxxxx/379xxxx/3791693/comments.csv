,BluntmanX,2008-05-09T20:32Z,"Hmmm..I remember this game from my begining PC gaming days, it's great to have found it, but I'm having a major issue with the graphics..when I load the game the main character and all enemies are invisible, and much of the eviroment is out of wack..any help?"
,ramplank,2008-05-12T14:46Z,"BluntmanX 
This game does not run on any modern pc.
It's most likely your videocard that's not compatible with the game. 
It runs best on an old pentium3, 256 mb, with a 3d fx card (like voodoo3). I still got mine, for the old games like this one and turok 2. 
It even got surround sound (soundblaster live)."
,animeisha,2008-09-12T03:31Z,"Actually, some modern PC's will play it, mine does, with Vista and all.  Sometimes temporarily rolling back your video card driver will help, and turning off some of the optional graphics options in the initial setup menu (also accessible by holding shift while starting up the game) and running in developer mode can also aid in removing some crashes and errors.  The planetdrakan forums have lots of tips and tricks as well."
,KayossZero,2009-03-13T04:09Z,"Heads up for those of you using XP (perhaps Vista) and newer video/sound cards and need help with the game.

If the game crashes after you try to start a new game you have a few options:

#1 Download the Unofficial 445++ Patch from http://www.arokhslair.net/downloads.html

#2 If that doesn't work then start the game in Dev mode (Developer mode:
Hold down Shift while starting the game.) and select ""Ruined Village"" as your start level (It's the first level)

#3 If you find music is not working then do this to fix it: Go to Start->Run and type Dxdiag, then go to the Music tab and disable default port acceleration.

Using these fixes I am able to play the game perfectly fine running TinyXP09 with a Geforce 7800GS and my onboard audio."
,Yuko87,2009-07-25T02:34Z,"Thanks for this ^___^ I have a question...everytime I try to play it says: ""this is not the correct version of drakan for this territory""

What's wrong with it?"
,megamoog,2011-03-11T23:57Z,Can somebody seed this please
