You're mixtapes are absolutely fantastic, and I always look forward to them each month."
[T],Shanklys Love Child,2007-09-04T07:59Z,Cheers y'all. I'm sure you've noticed how they get a bit more 'indie' as you go down. 
,bluegamba,2007-09-05T03:52Z,"Thanks Shankly,

Your mixes are superior. I don't know where you get it all from. For a modest choice of new music look at Bluegamba's Choice nr. 4. But I'm scratching the surface compared to what you deliver. Still, there may be some songs that you missed. Check it out.

Regards."

Shankly thanks for this one. I have art made for this and July. I also have some ready for September. Maybe if you can register at the forum search the members list for arthurofboro you could send me the tracklist and I can e-mail you the artwork to include in the torrent. You used to be able to PM from this site but I can't seem to do it now. If not I will post the art at the end of the year.
              Arthur "
[T],Shanklys Love Child,2007-09-30T06:12Z,"Arthur - Thanks as always. 
I don't decide the tracklisting until the last day of the month which is when I post the torrent, so I would have to be more organized to send you the tracklist in advance. BUT I do appreciate the covers - as I'm sure does everyone who has managed to collect these from the start. Keep em coming - even if it is at the end of the year."
