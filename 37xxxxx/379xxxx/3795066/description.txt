From Texas to South Carolina, see exclusive videos and fascinating photos of
the paranormal taken by average folks.  We serve up our wonders and questions
to the paranormal experts.

Enjoy a night on the town as we go on a ghost tour in San Antonio, Texas, visiting
Alamo Plaza and a few reknowned haunted hotels nearby.  Go on an evening
excursion with a team of ghost hunters roaming through a prison cemetery in
Huntsville, Texas.

We'll visit haunted restaurants, a dinner theatre and even a museum that has
unexplained pipe smoke.

Hear what one parapsychologist has to say about paranormal activity as we visit
the Rhine Research Center in South Carolina.

You might be surprised to hear what one ghost researcher and well reknowned
author learned about a famous haunted railroad crossing San Antonio, Texas.  Is
it a timeless hoax?

Hear from a lady who claims she saw an apparition of a little girl strolling out of
her bathroom out of nowhere.  See an actual still photo taken by the lady's friend.

American Ghost Hunts 101 demonstrates good ghost hunting and shows how
facts and data can easily be gathered the wrong way.  This is what makes this
show unique from the others.  AGH 101 is not just about face value testimonials,
but supports the stories with other view points and scenarios.
