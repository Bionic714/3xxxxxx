I always get my files from you.

I was kinda disappointed in the game though. 
It looked perfect on my Nvidia 8800 but, it was so short.
I beat the campaign in 3 hours on normal difficulty.
And I hear multi-player wasn't that great either.
I am glad I didn't waste my money on this game.

Thanks again Dopeman."

,Agente_Silva,2007-09-17T11:02Z,"Ok, I finally made it to play Airborne! BUT I used the HARTRED iso file that everybody said it was a fake - NOT! It is almost the standard Alcohol 120% or Daemon procedure! If you are having problem with this Dopeman version (wich I did) and still don´t want to quit on this absolutely stunning and way way better medal of honor (running on a P4, AGP platform - ATI X1950), do this (I´ll try to be very specific):

- make sure to have Alcohol120% (wich I used)or Daemon!
- download both HARTRED game and crack/keygen
- right click one of those rar files and drag it to Desktop, or another location, so that you´ll get a complete ISO file.
- open ISO file in Alcohol/Daemon and Mount it on drive (right click, choose mount on drive option)
- the install window will popup automatically, PRESS QUIT (I got a Fatal Error Blue Screen by pressing INSTALL)
- right click on the mounted drive and choose ""Explore""
- run EASetup
- when asked for key, dont cancel the installation. Leave that window opened and go for the downloaded keygen. This file will generate a key and automatically place it in the key window left behind.
- continue with installation
- after all is complete, copy the downloaded crack file, find the ""Binaries"" folder in the game location (that´ll be by default: c:programfiles/EAGAMES/...) and paste the crack!

There you go.... game is ready to rumble! Someone said the game was crappy ´n sh..t. Pah, pathetic... He probably didn´t have enough hardware to see how it ROCKS! Graphics are awsome, movement and interaction are great, challenging enough without making you go frustrated! Medic packs can be found regularly (still you´ll have to look for them, making you explore all map); hidden weapons, stats and medals awarded, upgrades to your weapon (more accuracy, rate of fire, etc..)! It is the best Medal by very very far! :D

Sorry for the long post... I just had to do it!"
,Agente_Silva,2007-09-17T11:14Z,"Oh, btw, there is a ""hartred"" file inside the crack folder wich Iused it for nothing... Don´t touch it :):P I did it and also got Fatal Error Blue screen! Don´t know why, maybe it´s just my PC but... better safe! :P Still, if you tried and had no problem tell what it is all about!

,Agente_Silva,2007-09-21T11:25Z,"Slippery1, I have one or two questions... Did you mount ISO file on drive, right? Did you use Alcohol or Daemon? Did you use the crack included in the ISO file, or downloaded the HATRED+crack keygen? Use the downloadable version of the crack. Start installation using EASetup (autorun application). I was getting unexpected reboots as well, but tried diferent ways to ""approach"" the installation! Anyway, if the problem persists keep posting, I´ll try to help you (unfortunately this section of the forum is only good for people to say ""thanks Dopeman you are the greatest"". When it comes to help no one cares...!!)

How fucking hard is it, to unzip a rar, install everything in the obviously marked folder ""HERE FIRST"" and then double click an exe.

GREAT GAME DOPEMAN, even though i carnt play. "

,chimpakawanzelu,2007-12-29T20:34Z,"I had a problem installing Ageia PhysX for some reason.  Still can't figure out why Ageia won't install.  I'm using Vista 32 bit and others have had similar problems with the Ageia PhysX (as seen in prior comments).  If you have the same problem...

Solution: download and install the demo from EA.  This will seamlessly install Ageia PhysX.  Then you can unrar and install dopeman's MOH.  Hope this helps others.  Cheers!"
