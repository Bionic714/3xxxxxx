,Gatherix,2010-10-15T04:54Z,"@Maddox777

You have to download a software that can burn ISOs (I recommend CDXPPro). Then, using the program, burn the ISO from the torrent onto a CD. Then, run the CD."
,Proat,2010-11-29T02:27Z,so is this legit or not?
,kabilie,2011-01-09T20:28Z,"so what are the controls to drive? i cant do anything, its just like there are no controls and i can't find anything in the menu's..."
,kabilie,2011-01-09T20:31Z,so what are the controls... only thing i can do is use the horn and switch views.. whats wrong with my controls lol?
,Timaman,2011-08-20T23:18Z,"The controls are as follows ; to go, # for burnout, z to go left, x to go right, / to go in reverse. Is anyone else getting a problem where the music played isnt the driver music but their own music from their PC?"
