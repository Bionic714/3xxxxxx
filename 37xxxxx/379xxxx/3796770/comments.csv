,Kimbo Kastekniv,2007-10-07T21:43Z,"The crack IS working. Just copy and past ""TMPGEncDVDAuthor3.exe"" to the installation directory and replace the original. Then run the program (you are asked for a serial, but don't bother) and close it. Now go to ""C:\Documents and Settings\[Username]\Application Data\Pegasys Inc\TMPGEncDVDAuthor3"" and copy and paste ""TMPGEncDVDAuthor3.en.lic"" and replace the original. Notice that the folder ""Application Data"" is hidden, to unhidden it go in Windows Explorer to Extra and then ""Folder options"" (or something like that, it's the latest menu-option"") then the second tab on the upper left, scroll down and tick the right circle (""Show hidden files and folders"" or something like that). It worked all fine by me."

,Rocky050196,2008-04-27T15:57Z,"I installed the program, but where can I find the crack?"
,David89an,2008-07-15T04:30Z,"""Settings\[Username]\Application Data\Pegasys Inc\TMPGEncDVDAuthor3"" were never created for me. Ive followd kimbo's tip but it didnt work out for me."
,arestice,2008-07-15T17:27Z,"Crack does work!!
Follow Kimbo Kastekniv's instructions!

If you can't find the application data folder,

Just use your computers search function, and search TMPGEncDVDAuthor3 it will come up with a list of things that have TMPGEncDVDAuthor3 in the name, one of them will be the folder Kimbo is talking about, or if you're on vista I think it is: Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Pegasys Inc\TMPGEncDVDAuthor3
That's what it is on Win Server 08

ALSO, he says 'Notice that the folder ""Application Data"" is hidden' So you wont see it unless you make the right changes to see hidden files and folders."

,stu9000,2010-01-25T19:04Z,"great sw. works v well. easy to use and renders dvd images really well. 
Crack DOES work. Follow instructions in the comments. BUT Sophos showed a virus ""TMPEncDVDAuthor3.exe belongs to virus, spyware mal/behav-285"".  I never know how concerned i should be but you decide."

,FrostyC,2011-01-15T16:24Z,"Themida is commonly used to hide malware, but it could also be used to re-create the EXE at the exact file size as the original...

Impossible to see if it truly is using malware..."
