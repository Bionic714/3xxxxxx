,FSDude,2007-09-07T14:46Z,After running the install it says something about checking if the game is up to date then says game is not installed or is installed incorrectly then removes Bon Voyage. Any way around that?

 at the end of the setup, it asks me CD4 of sims 2.
and i put the cd on the drive and nothing changes.
i have crack, serial, but nothing works. anyone can help me? :D"
,bilibilibili,2008-04-29T05:10Z,"and another question.
I unrar the file, but where is the f*cking .iso !?"
,DieBatterie,2008-05-22T16:53Z,"Hehe, I've been a little stupid.. I have had lots of different Sims-2 games, but everytime I tried to install an expansion, the original games was destroyed, so I could never play it again. But I think now I understand why. I've always installed the expansion in the same map which I installed The Sims 2 Original in, so, I'm gonna download this, but if I installes this in another map, the sims 2 original won't be destroyed even if the installation fales, right?


Hehe, jag har varit lite korkad. Jag har haft många olika Sims2-spel, men varje gång jag försökt installera ett expansion har original-spelen förstörts så att jag aldrig kunde öppna det igen. Men jag tror nu att jag förstår varför. För jag har alltid installerat expansionen i samma mapp som jag installerade originalspelet i. Så, jag kommer ladda ner detta, men om jag installerar detta i en annan mapp kommer väl inte original sims2 förstöras även om installationen misslyckas, eller?"
,Brokenangel-,2008-08-05T20:52Z,"Hey, does this work? I readed those comments but i ask you huys clearly now DOES THIS REALLY WORKS? :D
