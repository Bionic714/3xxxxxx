The Ego and His Own
(German: Der Einzige und sein Eigentum; also translated as The Individual and His Property; a literal translation would read The Sole One and His Property) is a philosophical work by German philosopher Max Stirner (1806-1856), first published in 1844.

While it wasn't popular during Stirner's lifetime, the book ended up having a major impact on the intellectual development of many major philosophical figures such as Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. Stirner repeatedly quotes Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller and Bruno Bauer assuming the that the readers will be familiar with all their works. He also paraphrases and makes word-plays and in-jokes on formulations found in Hegel's works as well as in the works of his contemporaries such as Ludwig Feuerbach. Other references include Greek History and Philosophy. This can make the book more demanding for contemporary readers.

Max Stirner recommended, instead of social reform, a ruthless individualism that should seek satisfaction by any means and at whatever risk.
