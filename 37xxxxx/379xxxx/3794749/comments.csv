,ja5ka,2007-12-25T00:36Z,Anyone tested if these work on 64bit Vista?
,tempemonkey,2008-01-01T18:40Z,"Well, I dragged and droped the exe into my language folder. double clicked it.... there is no 1p.cab file to be found.... any suggestions?"
,tempemonkey,2008-01-01T18:54Z,"Oh yeah, i have vista home basic, in Japanese!!! So maybe it only works for ultimate.... 

but doesnt the language pack automatically come with ultimate? 

How does Bill Gates sleep at night charging what he does for a product that is becoming a necessity and makes us pay even more for full functionality... He needs more competitors i think."

,forza666,2008-04-06T10:58Z,"Got vista ultimate with sp1 in it. When i try to install i get the message it isn't compatible with the os version. Seems to be the case that sp1 was initialy only brought out for 5 languages. So to be sure i tried the english version too (tried dutch one at first) but that also didn't work, anyone has a solution for that?"
