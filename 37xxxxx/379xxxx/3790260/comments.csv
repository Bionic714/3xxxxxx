,algorithm345,2007-08-31T11:26Z,"My apologies for all the restarting, I?m just going to leave it seeding and not restart my client it if it stops for a few minutes, seems that just leads to more problems :)"
,algorithm345,2007-08-31T21:13Z,"Here I thought this would go smoothly, I woke up this morning and my client was telling me my copy of the data was corrupted and needs to be redownloaded -_- I should be seeding again very soon."
,algorithm345,2007-09-01T05:55Z,"Could use a little help here, I was playing some of these files in mediaplayer, and upon restarting my computer, two of them now say they're too long and the torrent goes a black/red colour and refuses to seed.
I had to remove the two files before it would start, I'm happy to 'seed' it like that and upload the missing files seperatly, (this torrent could never be complete then though)  I'm not sure what would happen if I made a new torrent, would all the other files be transferable, they would all stay the same, and the chapters in question are two that have not been uploaded as of yet (as you can see I'm new to the uploading thing)"
,algorithm345,2007-09-01T06:47Z,"Attention: I've made a new torrent, should beable to use the exact same files except the few that were broken, I'm sorry for this inconvenience I have no idea why this happened, hopefully you can all download and enjoy this wonderful audio book soon.

,translated,2011-05-27T00:20Z,"Anyone who can seed this? I hunger for this torrent and if anyone who has this starts seeding, I would be extremely happy.

Thanks in advance :)"
