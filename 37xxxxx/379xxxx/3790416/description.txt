Ever wonder if celebrity truly dies with the celebrity, if graves really can
give up the dead, or if walls really do talk?  Then join the hunt for star
haunts and hauntings in and around the city of broken dreams - Hollywood,
California.  Find out the details of the odd pilgrimages and observances held
at celebrity gravesites, the eerie accounts of strange studio haunts, the
unusual tales of ghostly disturbances at the mansions of stars, and the
spooky sightings of apparitions on the Grey Ghost herself, the legendary
luxury liner, the Queen Mary.  You have a unique backstage pass to the
studio lots, the crypts, the tombstones, the cemeteries, and the home of
some of Hollywood's most notable characters, ranging from Bugsy Seigel
and Rudolph Valentino to Harry Houdini and Marilyn Monroe.
