,Chupi>:3,2007-09-07T10:14Z,"Just a clarification: This is the *full* original CD for 68K Macs, in standard Mac .dsk format (disk1.dsk). The other files in the zip are the 68K Mac emulator for Windows.

If you actually have a 68K mac, you can mount the .dsk with Disk Copy (or burn it) to play. Might also work on OS X in Classic mode; don't know, don't have a Mac... :(

The .dsk file should work with *any* 68K Mac emulator for any platform (not just Windows).

Note: I tried it on Basilisk II for Windows and all the ""fade"" effects were painfully SLOW. The included Mini vMac works much better. (PROTIP: Hold Ctrl to enter vMac's Control Mode. H for help, S to set emulation speed, F for fullscreen, etc.)

Also note: The game seems to crash once in a while in Mini vMac. I think I remember it being more stable on a real Mac, so you might want to try other emulators.

TORRENT STATUS: As of 9 Sept 2007, there are 4 seeds (incl. me) and 0 peers. Don't expect a hugely fast download, but if you leave it overnight it'll be done in the morning."

Thanks for the Clarification! I don't know too much about Macs, so the extra info really helps.

Also, thanks for uploading this."
