There was no extras in original
In menu, links to the unused audiotracs removed"
,vaino666,2007-09-04T23:22Z,"Menus takes (now) 81.44 MB. I did not convert them still becouse it is this movie, and it's style.
DD5.1 audio takes 467 MB. Run time is 2 and half hours.  So audio takes that. You dont compress audio.
4 subtitles tracks takes 55 MB
And rest is for picture. And nothing else.

How can BB4E release same movie, and say: 
Full Retail Duplicate (Probably a little bit Compression,  but without Compromising)
What shit is ?: a little bit compression"
,vaino666,2007-09-04T23:45Z,"And if you are wondering intrablock...
It's in the rebuilders advanced (expert) settings.
Cinemacraft encoders manual says page 77:
5.3.7 Intrablock DC precision
Specify the bit precision of the DC coefficient of intra-blocks. 10 is recommended for DVD-Video.

And that iDCT 64-bit...
That you can find where yours Dvd rebuilder is. (or avisynth)
There is DGDecode.html help file.
What I select, it's the best you can select, but slowest."

Difference can be that movie in theatre is 24 fps and in video 25 fps. Some times movie is played this much faster.
154x24/25=147,85"
,pentheus,2008-12-12T01:27Z,"NORDIC rips r good, but please please please dont remove eng subs... they dont take up much space.. thanks!!"
,aguhi,2009-03-15T13:33Z,"Which file should I burn? Am i supposed to put together all files to one or what? Plz help. I want to use ""IMG burn"" to burn the files."
,barton101,2012-08-05T03:46Z,"Next time, please include English subtitles for the hearing impaired. They are also good for people who don't have English as their first language. Subtitles take up hardly any extra space and they make for more seeders because the torrent is useful to more people."
