SUPERBIKE 2001 
One of the most long-awaited motorcycle racing simulations finally hits the shelves. Superbike 2001 has managed to pull off what most would have believed an impossible feat: to top the standard set by its excellent predecessor, Superbike 2000.

The superb graphics are realized thanks to precise attention to detail coupled with the extensive use of motion-capture technology. They√¢??ll have you believing that you really are sitting astride one of the super- charged two wheeled monsters. Under torrential rain or on tire-melting asphalt, your biking skills will be pushed to their limits in the extreme driving conditions. Your accurate interpretation of the telemetric track data to set the optimum performance for your mount will prove decisive in your success, or your failure. The only true simulation of the Superbike World Championship allows you to pit your wits against the worlds greatest Superbike riders: the teams and the tracks are all faithfully reproduced and updated to include all the changes and additions of the latest championship.
