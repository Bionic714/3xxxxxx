Note: This is a CD RiP of the final Retail version. Chamillionaire doesn't curse, so there probably will not be an Explicit version just for the guests (which they are the only ones that have words edited out). So don't complain that this CD is clean/edited... If an explicit version does actually pop up somewhere, I'll upload that then. Enjoy!
