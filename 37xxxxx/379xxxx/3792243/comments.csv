A Scanner Darkly is awesome, and so is the film!"
,Nicalapegus,2007-09-06T06:43Z,Uh... no it wasn't. But the other books are amazing.
,obnoxiousacid,2007-09-09T21:52Z,nice one philip k dick fuckin owns
,sideside,2007-09-10T08:32Z,"Well I thought A scanner darkly did a terrific job of conveying the book.
the book itself didn't have a traditional plot but my god what amazingly cleaver ""dickian"" dialog."
,test_account,2007-10-30T06:30Z,"I went to a 2nd had book store the other day and I couldn't find PKD anywhere so I asked, and the lady at the counter said they have to keep PKD behind glass because they get shoplifted more than any other author."
,iAMGINE,2007-12-30T18:31Z,Thank you.
,the999,2008-01-16T06:43Z,Thanks sideside.... 
,Po0py,2008-02-11T01:09Z,Are these unabridged?
,CandiedHaggis,2008-03-10T10:06Z,"Awesome!  Great torrent. Anything that stirs up interest in PKD is cool by me.  The VALIS and its two ""sequels"" are some of my favorite books ever, and 3 Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch was such a bizarre read it twisted my brain up into knots - it was like a psychedlic drug in book form.  I wonder how it comes across as an audiobook?  Guess I'll find out.   Thanks sideside."
,punkkin,2008-04-08T00:53Z,The quality is pretty rough on some of these.
,piratedmoney,2008-04-22T00:32Z,"K it's starting to come through. Just completed the Man in the High Castle, We Can Remember it For You Wholesale and Minority Report. So far the audio quality's fine IMO. Thankx :D"
,Timbad,2008-04-30T20:06Z,"Thanx, Thanx, Thanx and Thanx, great stuff! Will seed as long as I can :-)"
,fubbi,2008-05-01T21:14Z,"you forgot to mention blade runner based on ""do androids dream of electric sheep"". i guess that makes it ten movies."
,bertrandb,2008-05-15T22:04Z,Thanks a bunch!
,skwiez,2008-07-18T09:35Z,"Sorry, it's my personal policy to ignore anyone named Dingle."
,Symn,2008-09-22T20:27Z,"What format is this?
2 gig seems a lot for MP3"
,Symn,2008-09-27T14:17Z,"Arrgh... Paul Giamatti reading a scanner darkly.... awefull! as well as some other books in here. Very poor soundquality on Ubik, Broken bubble, The stigmata of Palmer Eldtricht. most are good though."
,philliph903,2008-11-16T00:51Z,"I actually liked Giamatti's voice : )

PKD is the man!

HOWEVER- UBIK, VALIS 1-3, and Stigmata sound like shit."
,wargasm69,2008-12-13T16:23Z,"Amazing torrent, PKD is my favorite author of all time!"
,xovius,2009-01-17T00:02Z,aren't these definitely all unabridged audiobooks
,xovius,2009-01-18T13:06Z,Oh this is abridged audiobooks
,me1983,2010-01-24T05:01Z,"About seven of these are decent. A couple are so poorly recorded it's hardly worth listening to. And most importantly, three or four (including The Minority Report and Paycheck) are no more than an hour and a half in length.

Haven't listened to them yet, but that tells me one of two things: Either we are getting a portion of the actual audio or it's so abridged it's more a screenplay for the film.

Either way, it's a decent download, but you'll need to go elsewhere for under half the books."
,vinveezy,2010-05-14T20:55Z,Philip K Dick was the BEST writer of ALL time. this is a GREAT torrent. I got it and am glad I did so
,Quasi666,2012-08-03T19:59Z,"Wow, great torrent and thanks to all sharing."
