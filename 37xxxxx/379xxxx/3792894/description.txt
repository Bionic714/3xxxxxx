This move features a topless cameo by Linnea Quigley as Sleeping Beauty, who was thereafter reigning Scream Queen for the next decade at least. There is lots of T&A in this adult-humor send-ups of all the best known children's fairy tales and stories.  This movie was made before B movie makers were too chickenshit to show hair pie.
I apologize for the quality. All I can say is that it is the same quality as the DVD and you may need to adjust your contrast up and brightness down - RUBrTOE.  Hello ACIDBURN.
