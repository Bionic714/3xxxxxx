After returning home from South Korea to great acclaim, 
three members of the U.S. National Taekwando teem set up their 
own martial arts studio in Las Vegas. When one member of 
the team turns up dead after taking part in a brutal 
underground fighting competition, it is up to the two 
remaining team members to investigate the murder and 
exact revenge upon those responsible. They are assisted 
by an old rival from Team Korea.
