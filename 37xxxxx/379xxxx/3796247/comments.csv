,W427,2010-02-21T15:56Z,"just watch this movie on TV but missed the start, great fucking movie i like Leonardo DiCaprio as an actor hes made some great movies this one is one of his best the movie is great cant wait to see it from the beginning to be honest though not his best acting a little sketchy lol but it was ten years ago he has come along way since then. the credit goes to the director ill defiantly be looking up a few more of his movies. i have always thort about how great it would be to live on a island like that not have the pressures of the city and society id be in heaven id love to build my own island paradise.... ohh we can dream...."
,W427,2010-02-21T16:23Z,thanks 66dino66 i really enjoyed this movie if u couldnt already tell from my previous comment i was wondering if u had any suggestions about any other similar style movies like what blaahead said i know this is a old torrent but i also like movies that are a bit different have a story that u can get into rather then these block buster bullshit that hollywood seens to be pumping out to make a quick buck although some of it is entertaining im really struggling to find a decent movie these days that really moves me get you thinking. haha thanks again hope to hear from you Great torrent great uploader!!  
,RaddekRaptor,2011-05-24T18:13Z,Thanks for offering this. Quality is ok... fairly pixelated. For some reason the speed is a tad bit quick while playing on my PS3 ???
