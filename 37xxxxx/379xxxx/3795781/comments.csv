,MrFingers,2007-09-07T06:33Z,"2 things;

1) does this game work on a macbook?  ie, no dedicated graphics card.

2) gbuh, thats all in greek or something, what is that link?"
,tazx,2007-09-08T00:31Z,"Anyone having a problem where all the punctuation marks show up as a vertical bar: |  ?

Thanks.

Mr Fingers: you could try it, but I've read no Macbooks or Minis will work. Some Cider games do.

,RomanSPQR,2007-09-08T13:13Z,The game should be fine on your macbook.
,tr0jan_,2007-09-09T13:34Z,is it possible to play the game with a widescreen resolution?
,RomanSPQR,2007-09-12T00:50Z,"here are some answers to your questions.

I haven't found a way to make it widescreen, if I do, I'll post how.

The punctuation marks appear as | in my game too, but it doesn't seem to affect gameplay.

I hope that helps!

,tr0jan_,2007-09-12T08:55Z,"thx for the quick answer roman!

,RomanSPQR,2007-09-13T21:17Z,"As far as I know, anything can be ciderized for Intel Macs.  I'll post if I find anything.

I've also seen some posts of people who've ciderized games on their own, so they're not official ports, but work just as well."
,phantomshadowxv,2007-11-22T04:50Z,"The game appears to run fine except... that I can't see my units! it's true, I have an intel macbook and the game seemed to run smoothly until I started to play. It's not that the units look like the terrain behind them, they don't appear over the terrain, but when I select an area circles appear on the ground as it happens when you select units!"
,RomanSPQR,2007-11-24T22:11Z,"phantomshadowxv - thats weird that you're getting that from the game.

My guess is that it can be fixed by either of these solutions:

play the game on an mbpro or better, macbooks have the graphics card soldered to the motherboards and use the main processor rather their own, so they're may be a conflict with the graphics card.

or

fiddle with the graphics settings - the game is kinda glitchy with text anyway and I found that adjusting the resolution and quality settings improved things.

as always, if you find a solution, please post it here!

thanks"
,stevie227,2007-12-20T17:00Z,Hey all. Does anyone know how to crack the multiplayer portion of this game? It asks for a gamespy cd serial number.
,th3_toast,2008-02-07T11:57Z,"Hi, I got a similar problem. I can see my units, but they are blank/without any textures.
everything else works fine. (I am using iMac 2,4 Ghz, so shared-memory graphics cant be the prob)
Can somebody help to fix this problem?
Thanx!!!!!!!!!!"
,Kriizi,2008-02-13T22:17Z,"Yes, I'm having the problems of all the units are completely black. I'm using iMac 2.4 GHz."
,AZpedr,2008-02-24T03:13Z,"No, this won't really work well on a Macbook... only on the Macbook Pros. Macbooks have the integrated graphics chip by Intel that sucks a$$ for gaming. That's why I got rid of my Macbook and built my own Mac..."

,nbase,2008-04-13T03:25Z,"having the same issues with the units not showing up as the people above, the game does run smooth.  It's also old as dirt, so it should work fine and dandy on a macbook."

,Omnis_Dementia,2012-08-02T22:40Z,"Hi! I download this and it's perfect, but I can't play online, it ask me for a CD-Key, I try to found it but when I write it, the - becomes | and when I try to play the game, shows me a sign that says that I have to write it right. How can I solve that problem?"
,jimbissimo,2012-08-29T03:13Z,"It works fine on my 2009 Macbook Pro, a little glitchy in some parts but the game is a lot of fun.

I HAVE A PROB THOUGH! When I play campaign its fine, I can go from level to level but when i close the game and reopen I have to start all over again! It doesnt let me save properly! Anyone know how to fix this please? 

Thanks!"
