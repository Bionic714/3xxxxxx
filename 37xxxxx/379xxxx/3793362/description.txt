Penn State Nittany Lions vs ranked no. 17 Tennessee Volunteers in Outback Bowl aired on ESPN. Thanks to whoever that had the original file on here, I resized it to 4:3, made it smaller with h264 compression and combined them into one file instead of two. I'm looking for the HD version if anyone bound to have it. I have PSU vs FIU on the way, so stay tuned! Enjoy!

See my previous torrents for other PSU releases.

WE ARE ... PENN STATE!

cheers,
