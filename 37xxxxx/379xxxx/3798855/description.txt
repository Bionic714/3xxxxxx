Adam & the Ants -- Peel Sessions (recorded live for John Peel radio show in 1978)

Formed in 1977, the earliest incarnation of Adam And The Ants included Adam Ant, Lester Square and Andy Warren, all former members of The B-Sides. During the early days of punk, Adam used to hang around Malcolm McLaren's Sex shop wearing black leather bondage gear. McLaren claims he suggested to Adam that he adopt the pirate image. Adam And The Ants first big hit was 'Kings Of The Wild Frontier' in April 1980, followed a few months later by 'Dog Eat Dog'. Next came 'Ant Music', 'Stand & Deliver', and 'Prince Charming'. Albums include 'Dirk Wears White Sox', 'Kings Of The Wild Frontier' and 'Prince Charming'. The longest lasting Ants Line-up was Adam (vocals), Terry Lee Miall (drums), Merrick (drums), Marco Pirroni (guitar), and former Roxy Music member Gary Tibbs (guitar).
