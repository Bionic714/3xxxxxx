,iamvilli,2007-09-01T11:00Z,"I saw the DMG volume is same to that FAKE one, who can make sure it is real 9a527 DMG?"
,MyKosmo,2007-09-01T12:34Z,"NONE of the Leopard DMG files that have appeared in the last several days are fakes. NONE of them are. The first one, uploaded by keegan, got corrupted and was passed around. It was never fake. 

This file is the Usenet upload put back together and working fine. Just burn it and install."

,talinux,2007-09-02T10:30Z,"lordbadr, are u sure that the file on http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3790729/9A527_Leopard_-_Real_and_working is a working version and not a fake?

On comment Mykosmo says is not working.
Did u try it?"
,kevinm1,2007-09-02T11:06Z,MyKosmo is the uploader so he's telling the truth that the first one got messed up somehow.
,magic.one,2007-09-02T11:08Z,Why he stopped seeding?! Start seed again PLZ!
,realslap,2007-09-02T11:39Z,"donÂ´t download this, itÂ´s a fake.. not working !!!"
,helmett,2007-09-02T13:17Z,"Humm I've a very bad feeling about this one guys..
Is the VEry first time i see a torrent where EVERYONE has the exact number of files. If you have Azureus looking at thr peers tab, you'notice that we all have the same and this is quite howful considering the way a torrent is supposed to work.. in my opinion this is a REAL FAKE, no matter what myKosmo sais, and btw why if this is in his opinion the ggod one he's not seeding?
too many weird things happening to be real..."
,emil.s,2007-09-02T15:47Z,"minoverta:

This torrent is the same as : http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3790729/9A527_Leopard_-_Real_and_working

Both are same size and just the filename is changed , the fresh tiger 10.43 wont let me restore it to my ipod (wich holds three install images - the 10.43 , 9A466 and 9A499 - this image won't let me restore and comes up with some : you must authenticate in order to restore) I have entered my password and cant understand this - all other DMG's I tried, just restore right on to my ipod!!

The fun ends HERE!!!!!"

,dbreul,2007-09-03T04:24Z,Also you must stop downloading this one first or the other one will not run. Try it if you don't believe. Abandon Ship!
