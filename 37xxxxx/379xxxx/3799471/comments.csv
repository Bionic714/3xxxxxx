,palmofsweden,2007-09-11T09:37Z,Why share freeware on tpb? I can go to some crappy page like simviation or fs freeware to do that.
,attunga,2007-09-12T12:02Z,"Not when the copyright has been breached you cant.
This plane is available from avsim as a FS2004 plane. I have modified it with panel mods, air.cfg mods such as camera views, extra paints and placed it into an auto installer for FSX. All a breach of copyright. 
believe me if it was OK to upload to a freeware site I would. If you want to make all those mods and get it working in FSX feel free to get it from a freeware site and spend a few hours sorting it all out... If you would like a package where its all done for you (but breaches copyright) then download this one. I hope palmofsweden understands a little more now."

When ppl read the word ""freeware"", already start to claim without paying attention in the description, that explains for itselft all the job done! "
