,dragos_kai,2007-09-09T06:59Z,Anyone know if this works yet?
,MrBrutal,2007-09-16T17:11Z,"It works.. sort of.. The game crashes at the same place every time,, after you go down in the little submarine in the beginning at the load screen ""welcome to rapture"".. I hade the same problem with another release.. Does anybody else have this problem? Would be glad for any kind of help."
,RedDevilDan2,2007-09-25T01:48Z,"MrBrtual, i think this your computer problems.  I can go pass the ""welcome to rapture""  If you have trouble with another release as well, it's obvious that it's something do with your PC."
,TheHooligan,2007-10-15T21:42Z,"I dont agree. It isnt that ""obvious"", it might be bad luck or some other crap and we do acutally use pirated games, we shouldnt expect to much. My game crasches in different parts of the game. Some time when I got quite far in the game and sometime in the begining."
