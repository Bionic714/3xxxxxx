,fredbred,2009-06-15T22:39Z,"A 10???

The damn thing crackled all the way through. If you hate crackling audio, look elsewhere, otherwise the video is great."

are you sure it just aint your speakers?
so many people leave comments like sound sucks, or cant see nothing but i can hear it.
most of the time it is you stupid fucks who cant get your shit straight, then realize it was your bad, and dont leave comments revealing your mistake.
be reasonable.
LONG LIVE TPB"

,BH99,2010-06-24T13:13Z,Video AND audio is good quality. Thanks.
,Roscoe666,2010-06-28T13:54Z,"Quality of sound can be pretty much dependant on the quality of speakers, but not in the reversed way as one would think.
On better speakers, a middle-quality audio can sound like crap, but on some old crappy 5W 2.0 it can sound as if it was perfect...
So if it sounds like crap, try getting crappy speakers :)"

This is prolly the biggest waste of fucking time ever. 

*SPOILER* 

Srsly ""ololollooollolololol teh dragonz haz taken over da world, so we gon keel em with sticks n ride on horses"" Completely unrealistic post-apocalyptic scenario. I mean wtf, the nukes didnt work? Or how bout the NATO or US Army? Apache's, F18's, Stealth Fighers and Aircraft carriers couldn't take out a bunch of flying ancient dinosaurs? Ffs, a seagul doesnt get within 5 miles of a aircraft carrier unless it allows it to >.<

Most ridicules piece of shit i have seen since Machete. And Christian Bale is almost as fugly to look at as that mexican guy. If you actually Google this movie, you will find under the Top 100 Worst Movies of all time. 

Good upload, shit movie"

Really ?? Seriously ???

What part of FANTASY are you not getting ?
Take a step away from the literal.net.

The fact that you dont ""get"" machete really does say it all."

Really funny to see people get worked up, trying to take a fantasy movie and explain how it sucks because it isn't realistic. 

Wow, wtf LOTR, why isn't Aragorn using his M16 on them orcs? And why is Gandalf calling packs of wild giant eagles to help him when he could be calling a pack of wild F-15E's?"

,TheBoxNinja,2011-03-01T20:18Z,"@ Recon_666:

you're an idiot. Firstly, the movie is fantasy, not everything needs to have an expanation. I pray you never watch any zombie movie, or any science fiction, or for that matter... 90% of all the movies out there. You'd be sorely dissapointed. However, since we're using 'reason' to explain this, there was an entirely massive amount of dragons, and the world was unprepaired for them. One dragon was capable of destroying an entire platoon of men, that hand tanks and heavy weapons. Tanks aren't overly useful against flying forces that spout fire. Aircrafts? dragons are a whole lot more agile than a fighter plane can be, and they also dont need to stop for fuel. As well: SWARMS OF DRAGONS. You also can't really fire nukes willy-nilly at flying menices... ps.
