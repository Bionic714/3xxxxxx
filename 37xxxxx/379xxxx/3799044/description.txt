Description:

Ballerburg takes you back to an era of castles, knights and crucial battles fought with cannons, catapults and magic spells - a time when ruling a kingdom was a daily battle for survival. In this humour-filled story, you mastermind the action as a general who has been ordered by his queen to get rid of her hated sisters in neighbouring settlements. Both you and your human or AI opponents have your own castles. Inside or around the castles you can also erect additional buildings and repair any damage to them as your power increases, giving you more weapons and magic. 

With either mouse or keyboard control, your aim is to destroy a pre-determined number of enemy buildings and the goals become more challenging as the action progresses with battle ratings and medals to be gained and record lists to track your progress.
