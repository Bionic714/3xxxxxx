Here are a few tunes that stand out from the past few years of electronic music.
If you are like me and think that a remix/remake needs a little more work than ripping 
the original music and adding a screaming blonde, you'll probably like this.
Also included are a few good originals not that well known.
The quality of the MP3s varies as my sources do.
