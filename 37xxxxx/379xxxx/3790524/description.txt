Wounded Knee, starting up as Wounded Knees from ashes of Anabola steroider. In the east of Sweden there were a lot of good bands in the 80Â´s. Like RÃ¶vsvett, Raped Teenagers, No Idea, S.O.D etc. Wounded Knee did some gigs around Sweden and I think some in Finland. WK was around til the early 90Â´s before they quit. Also did another EP and 1 LP, but I personally think this is the best shit they created. 
Ragge is still playing music and HT Pop Gun plays in Alliansen.
