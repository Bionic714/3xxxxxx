This is a LAMP image to run under QEmu. The archive is complete to run on an windows box and unleash the power of a linux webserver (LIGHTTP) combined with a powerfull database (MYSQL) and a splendid scripting language (PHP5). But thats not all. I have thrown in a mailserver (exim4) a spamfighter (spamassassin) a mailfilter (procmail) a pop/imap/ssl client (fetchmail) The best email client arround (mutt) and ofcourse your complete ssh thingies.

Your personal server station in a box. Small enought to carry arround on a stickie.

The image is currently in its virgin state under 500mb. Thanks to the qcow format it
will resize and store all data you want. So your better get rid of that silly live
image your still using.

Everything was build on the best Linux distro arround being Debian Etch and is fully
customizable. I intend to keep developing this baby and you may find its blog on 
http://qlamp.assist.dyndns.biz. You like it, you tell me. You have wishes. You tell me. Like to contribute? You tell me.

Have fun.....
