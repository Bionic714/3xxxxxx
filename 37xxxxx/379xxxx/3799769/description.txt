Earth Alerts is a Windows-based application that provides alert notifications, reports, and imagery on many types of natural phenomenon that are occurring real-time both worldwide as well as in specific locations within the United States (including Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands).

Earth Alerts makes use of the resources from organizations such as the National Weather Service, U.S. Geological Survey and numerous other agencies to identify what sort of things "Mother Earth" is currently doing.

To use Earth Alerts, you simply select the specific activity types (earthquakes, tsunamis, weather, etc.) and the specific locations you are interested in. The application will then automatically retrieve the latest information from various live data feeds on the Internet, and then present it to you.
