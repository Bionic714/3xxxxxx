Here\\\\\\\'s Disc 1 of Walt Disney Treasures - Behind The Scenes At The Walt Disney Studio.

Since this set is all important, I just shrunk it to about 60% except for the menus which are at 100%. Good thing is that you don\\\\\\\'t notice the pixelation all that much becuase there is a lot of black and white footage.


I will upload Disc 2 When someone please seeds Disney On The Front Lines - The War Years...

Please also share the chronological Donald volume 2.



I will also then share:

*Your Host Walt Disney

*Disneyland USA

*Disney In Space And Beyond

All of the above are ready to just upload the torrent file so please if you have my requests share them.


PLEASE SEED WHEN DONE! DON\\\\\\\'T LIMIT YOURSELF TO JUST LEECH... AS ALWAYS ENJOY!!!
