,SmilySmile,2007-09-02T21:44Z,"You mind seeding this, so others can download it to? Right now 0 seeders/8 leechers, and i'm stuck at 38%"
,BlackBird1010111,2007-09-03T04:17Z,"Definitely still seeding, but low bandwidth during the day plus others leeching means crappy speeds at first.

Keep patient, it'll come through =)"

,nativecodder,2007-09-13T06:36Z,"If you have the customizer and not the boot disc, please put it up. I'm interested in the tweak that installs the critical updates for you. Thanx."
