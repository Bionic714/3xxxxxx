Allison Scott (Katharine Heigl) is on the fast track for a promising career as an entertainment journalist. Her big plans get a little messed up, though, after a one-night stand with a total slacker (Seth Rogen) gets her pregnant. Although she has the determination to be a successful working single mom, Allison tries to involve her baby's daddy in her life, but he may turn out to be a little too immature to handle fatherhood.
