An unreachable shot to the green. A hopeless romance. Driving range pro Roy Mcavoy can't resist an impossible challenge. Each is what he calls a defining moment. You define it. Or it defines you.
With lady-killer charm and a game that can make par with garden tools. For Roy, golf is a head and heart game.
So Roy and his caddy set off to do the impossible, win the US Open.
