I looked around the site here and found no copy of Egypt Central on the bay.  After some digging, I found a copy in .wma (Fuck that) and converted it to mp3.  Complete album, ready to go.

If you like this album, go and buy it, seriously.  These guys are just getting started, and I hope this gives them a wider audience.  

Included on this album is the single, "You Make Me Sick," which seems to be on Sirius quite a bit - what a great song.  Tap your foot to it, and SEED you bastards - this is a community! :)
