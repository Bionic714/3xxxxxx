Plot Synopsis from AMG

The prolific Takashi Miike directed this Japanese crime drama that is set at the same U.S. military base at Yokosuka seen in Shohei Imamura's Pigs and Battleships (1961), yet takes a tour of the Okinawan underground youth culture. Bi-racial bartender Chuji (Tanabe Seichi), son of an Okinawan mother and a black American GI, moves into a music career after a record executive hears his dynamic blues harmonica playing. When young yakuza Kenji (Ikeuchi Hiroyuki) collapses in the alley behind the nightclub where Chuji works, his life is saved by Chuji's girlfriend, a veteran's assistant. It's the beginning of a dangerous association, as the gangster introduces the bluesman to another way of life -- and soon trouble erupts. Shown at the 1998 Vancouver Film Festival.

Another masterpiece from Takashi Miike, 26 April 2002
10/10

Takashi Miike┬┤s 1998 film BLUES HARP is not as outrageous as FUDOH or DEAD OR ALIVE and not as disturbing and shocking as AUDITION or VISITOR Q. It isn┬┤t a gory bloodbath like ICHI THE KILLER. It is a Yakuza film very much along the lines of CHINESE MAFIA SEASON, RAINY DOG and LEY LINES.

BLUES HARP is a really great film. I was once again amazed how many of my favorite films are from Miike-san. BLUES HARP has now joined them. The actors are great, the cinematography is gorgeous (once again by HANA BI cinematographer and longtime Miike collaborator Hideo Yamamoto) and most importantly what happens on-screen feels REAL. You get the feeling that real people lead these kinds of life all the time and (in variations) all over the world. And even though we are dealing with criminals here Miike portrays them with what seems like genuine affection, even love while never, NEVER, glorifying the Yakuza lifestyle. One gets the feeling he really knows what he is making films about and considering his past that is most probably true. Whatever Miike does in the future I┬┤ll be there and every film lover should keep an eye on this man.
