For Those About To Rock We Salute You is about as raw and hard as it gets with AC/DC. This album is filled with many catchy songs, leaving it as a terrific follow-up to Back In Black.

1.For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)- This famous song starts off the album with a hard, rocking beat. 9/10
2.Put The Finger On You- A solid rocker with a catchy chorus. 8/10
3.Let's Get It Up- An awesome upbeat song with great guitar and another catchy chorus. One of my favorites. 10/10
4.Inject The Venom- Solid, hard rock song. 'Nuff said. 8/10
5.Snowballed- Okay song. Good beat as always, but not a standout track. 7/10
6.Evil Walks- A great song with an ominous chorus and good lyrics. 9/10
7.C.O.D.- Kind of filler, not really a standout track. 6/10
8.Breaking The Rules- The beginning guitar and the beat during the verses is good, but the chorus is a little repetitive. 8/10
9.Night Of The Long Knives- Very good song with extremely catchy guitar in the beginning. 9/10
10.Spellbound- Mediocre, not a great way to end a rock-filled album, but has well-written lyrics. 7/10

Overall, this album is one of AC/DC's finest masterpieces, filled with innovative rock songs and catchy guitar licks. If you loved Back In Black (which most people do), then you'll love For Those About To Rock We Salute You.
