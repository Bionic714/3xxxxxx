,DragFire,2007-09-03T00:18Z,I dont know alot about xbox 360 and have a noobish question... do you need to mod/chip the console to play copied games?
,klixxx,2007-09-03T21:37Z,I HAVE DOWNLOADED 360 GAMES BUT I CANOT WRIGHT THEM I HAVE DUEL LAYER DISKS WHAT PROGRAM DO YOU USE TO WRIGHT.
,prylis,2007-09-07T20:19Z,U have to use Imgburn. Then it's depends on wich chip you have. You have to put in a layer break in option etc.....you can't just burn from the img fil.

,chainedfreeman,2007-12-04T11:44Z,is this region free?  Klixx to burn games use clone cd and make sure your burner can handle dual layer dvd's.  Also you have to remember that you will have two files one ill be a .iso and the other a .dvd you have to select the .dvd file to burn.  If you really want to save money on disks from bad burns i would suggest downloading a program called mulleter beta 10.  Run this program on the iso images before you burn them and this program will tell you id the image is good and if it is not it will help you fix the image.  Now to Dragfire you have to mod the console by flashing the firmware you can find tutorials to show you exactly how to do this  at this website http://360mods.net/index.php.  You could probably also find a way to download mulleter beta 10 from this website so good luck!!

,fanfandehd,2008-01-15T14:00Z,is it mutli 5? Which languages?
,HawkwindUK,2008-01-17T16:48Z,"  THANKS micaelus - Woks great!!!

Burnt using CloneCD 5.3.0.1 and 1x speed

Use 'Write From Image File' and select the gst-fm2.dvd and NOT the .iso

Hope it works for the rest of you!

(Do NOT use CloneDVD!)

1x speed IS important!"
,HawkwindUK,2008-01-17T18:20Z,"Thanks for Mulleter info chainedfreeman.

,Enter98,2008-02-20T16:42Z,"Sory this is not good upload because the track ""Nurburgring"" is not working he show me (only at this track) ""Clean Cd or restart your console"", how can I repair it? all tracks working so it must be a problem with iso yes?"
,bauer-xx,2008-05-10T17:17Z,plz seed
,AdmiralVonHook,2008-07-09T15:26Z,"Yes, It's working.

Why must people always ask ""Is this region free"" and similar questions.

READ the name of the torrent, It says PAL, wich means this is PAL, NOT Region Free or NTSC, if it had been Region Free or NTSC the torrent would have been named Forza_Motorsport_2_REGION_FREE_XBOX360-GST.

Forza_Motorsport_2_NTSC_XBOX360-GST.

This is not the only game that I've downloaded where people ask those questions.

Do you people get it?

'cause it's kind'a annoying when people always ask about things they just need to open their eyes to get the answer."

,kahuna88,2009-08-03T03:24Z,"@Admiral

There ARE games that say PAL but are also Region Free. So this is why some people ask that question."
