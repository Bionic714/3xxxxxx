Roller Coaster Tycoon 2



Seems like some people dont understand how to install so heres a FEW guide steps ;)


Installation Manual:

1. Download the torrent.

2. Wait untill the download is completed.

3. Open the downloaded folder.

4. Look for a file called "Autorun".

5. Double click the file called "Autorun".

6. Select the language that you want to have. I recomend you choose a language that you can speak. You can choose between English, Frence, German, Italian, Spanish and Swedish.

7. Follow the steps in the installation.

8. When the installation is finished go to your download folder again and look for a folder called "Crack". Double click on that folder and you should see a file called "rct2". If you dont see it, smash your computer with a hammer and buy a new one :)

9. Right click on the "rct2" file and press copy.

10. Now go to the folder where you installed "Roller Coaster Tycoon 2".

11. Right click press "paste". Hopefully a window popped up and said "Would you like to replace the existing file?"

12. Press "Yes". 

13. Now all you have to do is double click the file in your installation folder that you now pasted "rct2". 

14. Now the game should be running :D 

15. ONE IMPORTANT THING LEFT! DONT delete your download folder, KEEP SEEDING so other people can enjoy the game with a fast and clean download.


Enjoy people :)
