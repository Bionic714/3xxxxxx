,mcgrom,2008-11-04T04:18Z,Titi I can't get your games to work I burn the ISO image to DVD RW and attempt to copy with dvd2xbox but it won't work and fails on at least 5 files with every game that i've tried from you using multiple iso copy programs nothing seems to work whats wrong?
,SacramantiC,2008-11-12T23:37Z,"TiTi26 indeed you rock. your games do work!!!!
alcohol 120% at lowest speed i can burn at 2.3X.
 you get the best closest clone. you can use dvd2xbox and all should be working!dont buy cheap dvd-r there is a difference."
,Janiinanii,2009-02-16T17:58Z,this game is fucking rule! i have it
,badamrock,2009-09-02T04:25Z,"Why would you not just mod your xbox and burn it onto a DVD-R and just play it from your disk...

Also good to see despite 5 seeders im getting 40+kbps. I'll be sure to seed when I'm done."
,Lixifer,2010-09-11T05:14Z,Works perfectly as far as I can see.  (Played ~2.5 hrs so far)  Much like all Titi's uploads!  Big ups!
