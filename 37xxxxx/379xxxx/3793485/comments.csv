,eyesblue,2007-09-06T21:22Z,"Hey...tornado_78125, it works on getting it up and running, and installed, and on my desktop and it launches. If anyone wants, I can get you there in simpler terms. It will not register actually out. let you know how it does after I can try it out with a game. thanks"
,eyesblue,2007-09-06T21:34Z,"Simple instruction, open and install 120%, when you get to register screen, open keymaker, then go to here and copy the new serial, go back to keymaker and hum already pasted, in keymaker.. click activate, now make sure you are not online to the web, close it down.... no internet connection, now on 120% screen, click register button and it will launch to full operation. that simple. you just registered without the internet connection. have fun. FYI the 3 rd program is needed to make it register, I have seen this in other programs I have downloaded. See ya"
