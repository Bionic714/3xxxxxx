Adobe Dreamweaver, or simply Dreamweaver, is a web development tool originally created by Macromedia (now part of Adobe Systems). Initial versions of the application served as simple WYSIWYG HTML editors but more recent versions have incorporated notable support for many other web technologies such as CSS, JavaScript, and various server-side scripting frameworks. The software is available for both the Mac and Windows platforms. Dreamweaver is currently owned by Adobe Systems, which acquired Macromedia in 2005.
