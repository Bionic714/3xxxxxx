,sippor,2007-12-15T13:10Z,the fucking sound is wrong
,patrioticparadox,2007-12-23T01:09Z,sippor maybe if you gave some details of what you are running we could help you get your sound right because it appears no one else is having problems with their sound. or you could just complain like a little bitch.
,skit1823,2008-03-07T05:10Z,"umm.. my audio doesnt work either. but i am running a basic setup of audio on a compaq laptop

,shaghion,2008-05-24T10:40Z,"as someone else already stated, only the sample doesn't have audio. are you shure you're oppening the right file? cuz the main file works perfectly for me (and apparently for everyone else too)"

,S53,2009-08-29T02:32Z,"Fuckin idiot. Doesn't matter what year it came out. Don't listen to ""funkydl"". What a ignorant asshole.

Film rated 8.4 on IMDB. Very good movie, I highly recommend it. "

,CoMRaD311,2010-02-04T11:45Z,"thank you
best dvd rip on here
and so fast!!"
,themartini,2010-03-19T12:10Z,"Well, funkyDL, what did you expect?
It is stanley Kubrick, one the masters of film, so one would naturally expect a high quality film that does not glorify war, but instead shows the deep psyhcological trauma it can cause.
Nice work on picking this concept up and showing you're pure intelligence to the rest of the community via your use of sarcasm. Kudos to you.

... You were being sarcastic, right?"
,bokehjoe,2010-04-26T10:47Z,I would guess that funkydl was just a twinkle in his daddys eye in 1987.  '87 is probably the time of the dinosaurs in his mind. And let me guess funkydl- your favorite war movie would be... 'Blackhawk Down'! Or maybe 'Hurt locker'. Watch a movie sometime called 'Apocalypse Now'- it's even older than FMJ!
,bokehjoe,2010-04-26T10:50Z,"Forgot to give some love to Freakzilla79 for taking the time to up this piece of art, 
You da man Freaky-z!  Thanks! "
,joek666,2010-09-30T04:40Z,"Apoclypse now, Full metal Jacket, and Saving private ryan are the best war movies of all time"
,stzfrkx,2011-05-16T13:32Z,"Thanks. 
A: 9
V: 8
It is good quality overall, but this ""remastered"" version unfortunately cuts almost a third(!!) of the screen. See for yourself:

,stzfrkx,2011-05-16T13:36Z,"Sorry, wrong torrent!! I did not means this one!! Sorry!! ^^"
,diakon27,2011-06-19T02:09Z,I do not get why alot of people download the Blu Ray Rip of this movie. Sure the picture & sound may be better but on a laptop it always fuzzes out. At least on mine it did. As soon as I DL this torrent im deleting my BR Rip. Thanks for the upload Freakzilla79. This movie has me Rotflmfao!
,4LoKo,2011-08-13T00:37Z,Good share man!

,titus227,2012-01-26T23:57Z,"Thank you so much for making this an AVI file.  I hate to DL a torrent just to find another codec that the xbox can't handle.  btw, if FunkyDL thinks this is a bad movie, then he wouldn't know a good one if it shit on face.  I love this movie, takes me right back to Basic. "
