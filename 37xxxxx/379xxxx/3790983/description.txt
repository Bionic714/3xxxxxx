The Intercepting Fist aka La Fureur Des Poings - Documentaire Sur Bruce Lee, Indedits Doc 2 (1997)

rEVIEW By K. HERFURTH

This DVD from the Bruce Lee estate discusses some of Bruce Lee's ideas about fighting to include previous film footage not seen anywhere else. Most of this footage is from the TV series Longstreet from the late sixties-early 70's. It would be noice if some of these episodes where available for purchase.

Also has some interviews with people who new and trained with Bruce. Production values are nominal, but it is still well worth it. Almost all of the footage is either rare or behind the scenes. A must for the Bruce Lee fan!
