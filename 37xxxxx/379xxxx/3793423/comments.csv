,raidsiren,2008-05-26T09:40Z,"Superb upload, sir. PB needs more like this!"
,yang_damian,2008-06-27T22:01Z,Keep in mind this is not the uncut version; the uncut version has about 40 minutes extra
,zushigreg,2009-09-19T06:46Z,"This version is good. The video is fine, though a bit dark. And the audio is OK too, though it sounds a bit overdriven *almost* to the point of being distorted, but not quite. The English subtitles are fine.

There is about 7 seconds overlap between video1 and video2. The audio was cut there, but it is just the narrator speaking --  no big problem. (and you could edit this if you really wanted to, nothing is missing). 

The runtime is 1:14:42 for video1 and 1:26:49 for video2 -- totaling 2:51:24 or 171:24 when the 7 second overlap is taken out. I don't know if that makes this a cut version or not . . .

The other version on thepiratebay at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4567657/ is the same filesize but in one file. It is less well seeded, and the subtitles end at 2:40, so I doubt it is any longer than this one.

,Incamal,2009-12-30T10:32Z,"To zushigreg:
The runtime for video1 (1:14:42) and video2 (1:26:49) DON'T total 2:51:24 or 171:24!!!
They total 2:41:24 or 162 min!
So this is the Argentinian version!"
,omeezy500,2010-04-27T12:04Z,"woo hoo! this is the best available version & ""most well seeded"" at this date in the torrent world =) I'm so appreciative, tyvm!!!"
,sunnyape,2012-08-18T03:10Z,"Good quality for the file size. Considering the age of the movie, the larger rips are hard to justify.
A=8, V=8, M=9."
