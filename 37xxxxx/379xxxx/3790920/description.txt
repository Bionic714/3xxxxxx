Bruce Lee, The Legend Lives On (2002)


Review by John Wallis:

It is always sad when people die before their time, and it is a testament to Bruce Lee's legend that his fame continues, so much so, that I've seen at least four different documentary programs this year featuring either cursory or a wealth of info about the enigmatic martial artist.

One of the unfortunate things setbacks any popular figure or event faces when being compiled for a documentary is the filmmakers being able to say something new. From the start, I got a sense that Bruce Lee: The Legend Lives On was going to be one of those cases where I wasn't going to see much I hadn't already seen. And, by the end, when I saw that there were absolutely no credits, no one taking responsibility for the documentary, well, I wasn't too surprised. Not that it was terrible, but it was just a slapdash affair of the standard interviews with his brother, his students (including right hand man Taky Kimura and the recently deceased James Coburn) , one of his school teachers, various actors/film producers (including Jackie Chan and the Vice Pres of Golden Harvest), interspersed with the standard Lee bio info , some clips from his films and candid stills. Some if the info is in annoying scrolling (or should I say 'stuttering') text at the bottom of the screen.
