,carv,2007-09-08T18:55Z,not much good without a user guide
,Zoraster,2007-09-11T00:09Z,do you really need a user guide if you know Joomla?
,carv,2007-09-22T18:43Z,Yes you need a user guide if you want more than just the look of the template and want the functionality also... to set up things like the moo menu and some of the other bell and whistles which aren't really related to joomla itself.

I tried to join that shit for weeks or find someone to invite me, it´s bullshit!!!! 

I recommend to visit graphicboards.org and boygj.com   here you´ll find all the latest stuff : )))

Now I´ve got so many templates and scripts that I dont know what to do with it... exept from creating a nice torrent and present it here on the piratebay ; )  best site ever!!

So keep your eyes open guys.... ehe!"

 ladda upp allt du har från joomla dårå! Jag vill ha lite att leka med eller mejla över till program at live.se är du skitbussig."
,slagathor,2008-03-16T02:35Z,"Frailwords.com doesn't respond to any requests for an invite.  Demonoid wannabes.  And Rapidshare wants bucks to join.  So gglund pettle your bogus self promotion somewhere else.  Just post Joomla and Web Development tools here on PB.  Get the word out, and it will happen."
