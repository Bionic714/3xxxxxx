,pointandclicker,2007-10-23T03:49Z,"Hi.  Sorry, haven't been on here for a while.  I'm using a software than automatically manages how and when my torrents gets seeded so that I can ""spread my love"" (for music, that is) equally.  That's likely why you sometimes not see these being seeded.  But since I love Spoon so much, I just changed my settings to force seeding all my Spoon torrents.  Enjoy!"
