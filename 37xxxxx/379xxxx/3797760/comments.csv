1. Change the file ending in .001 to .r00;
 then do this with all the other files; so .002 => .r01 ...
2. Extract all these files (I extracted them all together) You might get some errors, thats ffine
3. You get a file which ends in .iso
4. This file you mount (for example with daemon)"

,theguider,2008-01-11T23:53Z,"===========================================================================================!

ok this is a step by step guide from PERSONAL experience (this is how it worked for me)    !

===========================================================================================!
STEP 1. change the file names from flt-tsbv.001 to flt-tsbv.r01, ect just like ""mescallw"" said.
step 2. once the iso file has been extracted into the FOLDER ""flt-tsbv""  mount it with ultraiso, majiciso, deamon tools or any other programs like that. (when i say mount i mean mount to virtual drive mostly in the program (tools...mount to virtual drive)
STEP 3. when the iso is mounted the autorun installation should start, then type in any of these keygens:

D97X-VQGQ-SEHU-2IR4-0HTD
N2X7-GK2H-5KFZ-6VF8-0HTD
4EXX-PCKA-B969-WTRB-0HTD

STEP 4. Once the installation finishes explore the file ""sims2ep6"" in My COMPUTER.
STEP 5. Locate the file ""Fairlight"" and inside it should be a file called ""Sims2EP6"" (THIS IS THE CRACK!!!!!!!!)
STEP 6. locate the directory you installed Sims 2 Bon voyage (default :c/program files/ea games/sims 2 bon voyage or something like that.
STEP 7. Copy the file ""Sims2EP6"" into the main directory default :c/program files/ea games/sims 2 bon voyage and also into the folder called ""tsbin"" and that should be it!!!!

Note: First time loading may take a little while!!!!

,ausloader,2008-05-18T12:10Z,"Ok i see a lot of people are having problems with this game. Here is a basic tutorial of how to install.
1. Open Winrar and direct it to the download folder
2.  Double click on flt-tsbv.001
3. Extract flt-tsbv.iso to your desktop for ease of use.
4. Get Majiciso
5. To mount iso's the program will ask you to get
magic disk ( its free!)
6. The program will autorun once mounted if not then run autorun.exe manually.
7. An error message might pop up telling you something about failed transfer, just click retry and it'll work.
8. Once the program has installed navigate to the
""TSbin"" folder default(c:/program files/ea games/sims 2 bon voyage/TSbin)
9. Copy the crack found in the ""Fairlight"" folder on the mounted image into the TSbin folder.
10. It'll ask to overwrite the existing file, click yes.
11. Thats your crack installed and everything should now work, HAVE FUN!!

,Sirreal420,2008-05-26T22:03Z,"Heres some advice, instead of dragging and dropping cracks, copy and paste them (seemed to work for me). also if you get freezeing when trying to start your game, go to my documents-->ea games-->the sims 2 and move that folder to the desktop then start the game again, it will recreate the folder, and you will have to do all your custom content over again. (but you were smart and put the content folder on your desktop.) and lastly never pay for sims content, use this website --> http://paysites.mustbedestroyed.org"

How did u solve it? > < Does anyone have an IDEA of how to solve it? xD"
,jonny_558,2008-06-19T20:57Z,"Hi. So now i explain so even a noob can fix so he/she can play.

1. Download MagicISO seek on google.

2. Go on this websuit and seek after the game (NO-CD Crack) ex: The sims 2 H&M
http://www.gameburnworld.com/gp/gamefixes/sims2freetime.shtml

3.If you haven't Winrar then download it seek on Googel.

4. Mabie the files you have downloaded isen't winrar so you can extract it, then rename all files that have 001, 002, 003 
and so on in the end if the name RENAME THEM TO: r01, r02, r03 and so. Just take off the 0 and replace with r.

5. Now when the files is rar you can extract the files, Take the first winrar file and right click and click extract hear.

6. Now you got a big file that are more then 200 mb. Now open the big file with MagicISO (when it come up thing just click ""Try it"".
Now seek up the buttom named extract and click on it, extract it in the same map you have downloaded the game ex: The sims 2 Bon Voyage

7. Now you must have a file named AutoRun. Click on it and then it open the file. Then folow what is stand.

8. Then you put the serial key: 1PH9-2Q1J-1111-G111-1FLT

9. So now put the NO-CD crack ex: Sims2EP6 and file like that in /Pogram/EA GAMES/The Sims 2 Bon voyage/TSBin and replace
the old one with the NO-CD crack.

10. Now dubbel click the NO-CD crack ex: Sims2EP6 and now ENJOY!

Hope this worked. Tell if it worked plz!

Skip all the numbers after 8. If you have a newer the sims 2 like The sims 2 FreeTime."

I've done everything I'm supposed to do
But when I try to start the game I get this message ""Failed to enumerate and DirectX 9 compatible graphics adapters in this system! Please make sure you have a DirectX 9 compatible graphics adapter and have installed the latest manufacturer provided driver. The application will now terminate...""
I've never had any problems playing the sims before! I have all the earlier expansions and always been able to play. Please tell me what to do!"

,saitoshinya,2008-11-11T15:38Z,"kteddycharms--your system does not meet system requirement...you will be needing graphic card and possible more power supply for it as well as about 1gb of memory for it running smoothly. 

sorry for bad english.

,-iDragon-,2009-08-04T08:12Z,"Okay, downloaded this and the install went through just fine. Game froze at first and I was about to come here asking for help when I realized I hadn't updated my InTEENimator mod. ^^ So make sure all of your custom content is compatible with the expansion you're installing.

Once I updated that, everything went smoothly. This is a really great torrent, thank you changoboy for uploading and thank you to all the seeders who helped me get this in less than a day.

If you're having problems, all I would suggest is make sure your custom content is compatible and to definitely read all the previous comments. I see people asking questions already answered on earlier pages."
,sysun,2009-12-26T12:24Z,"I have no idea if it is multilanguage, have just started to download this expansion. :)

But, even if it isn't - here is the link to change language. And it isn't that hard as it looks like. ;D
