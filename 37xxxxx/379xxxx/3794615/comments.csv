,dowhatnow,2007-09-04T13:28Z,I'm not touching it till Wiikey puts it out.. But thanks for the upload.
,ChReeX,2007-09-04T18:40Z,"Yeah, me niether, but i thought some of you guys would be glad if i uploaded this :P"
,dowhatnow,2007-09-04T19:54Z,I am glad to at least see something out of the Wiikey camp.  I had kinda given up on the idea of them ever releasing an update.
,znabela,2007-09-05T20:14Z,"[08-09-03] Wiikey update 1.9b

A leaked version of the wiikey firmware update is available on several websites. While the leaked firmware is indeed working and has all of the announced features, it has not yet been fully tested and does not come with the configuration and recovery discs. A full version will be available from wiikey.cn very soon."
,ChReeX,2007-09-10T21:08Z,"I have now tested this on my own console, and now i can run my 1.2 disc again :D"
,dowhatnow,2007-09-12T04:15Z,^How come?
,cooljunior,2008-01-03T21:45Z,"hur och vart får man tag i recovery disc-en?
Mitt wii blev semi-brickat och jag måste försöka uppdatera om det.
Det var super mario galaxy som brickade det fast inte PAL som mitt wii har så det uppdaterade fel och nu har jag två väderkanaler och wiiet kan inte läsa nybrända spel...

(Where can i find the recovery disc for 1.9g? my wii is ""semi-bricked"" cant read new burned games and has two weather channels..need to recovery, i did format wii system memory but it still doesnt work.)"
