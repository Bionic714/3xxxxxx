,laffer99,2007-09-07T22:32Z,VIRUS!!
,cob_hc,2007-09-08T00:16Z,"works, but u got to activate it each time u r opening it... (....???)"
,MHv3,2007-09-08T11:38Z,This is NOT a virus!
,jdestremps,2007-09-10T10:18Z,"BEWARE.  I installed this, and now my Windows Explorer is hosed every time I use it.  It stalls and waits and takes forever and basically (even though I uninstalled PowerISO) it looks like my computer is now fucked."
,jdestremps,2007-09-10T10:21Z,"Let me clarify.  It appears that if I have a blank DVD in the drive, then explorer hangs up.  But I don't recall this behavior in the past."
,MHv3,2007-09-10T13:15Z,It works wonderful on my cpu

[V],RadioActiveWeasel,2007-09-17T23:07Z,"%100 works.

#1 used tool in my arsenal next to WinRAR.

all a real man needs.

and odds are a keygen is never a virus and never will be, its just perceived that way by your scanner.

I only downloaded the keygen.  I got powerISO from their website directly.  But I suppose this one would work fine too.

Thanks MHv3.  Will seed for a few days."
