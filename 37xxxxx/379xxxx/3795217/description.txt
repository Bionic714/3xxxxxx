This will install settings files for uTorrent.
This includes RSS feed info for a lot of tv shows, that can be set to download by selecting the check boxes next to the shows name.
The included shows can be found in uTorrent's RSS Downloader window in the Favorites tab.

I released this because these settings are great for those who may be new to uTorrent.
Those who already use uTorrent can just use the RSS settings installer to see the rss info for the tv shows that I set up.


Change Log:

1.0 to 1.1
	Only updated the packaging a tiny bit for distribution purposes. The installed files are exactly the same, and the installers only have a few words in the prompts changed but are still basically the same.
