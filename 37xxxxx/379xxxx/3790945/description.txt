There have been movies. There have been documentaries. But there has never been a film on Bruce Lee's martial art of Jeet Kune Do - until now. Produced in cooperation with the Bruce Lee Estate, this is possibly the most significant martial arts film ever produced.

And, for the first time ever, witness Bruce Lee's research notes, drawings, home movies, private recordings, and audio recordings.
