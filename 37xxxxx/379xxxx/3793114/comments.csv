,alenkr,2007-09-12T18:39Z,HA ! HA ! HA !
[T],kef71,2007-09-13T12:05Z,"Unfortunately I can't start seeding S3 until the 1:st of October. Sorry for this, but some private matters makes it impossible to start any sooner. I will then upload 1 season / week."
,eb#1,2007-09-13T21:17Z,"No, problem. It's nice to have something else but cold and darkness to look forward to in october :-)"
[T],kef71,2007-09-14T10:59Z,lol :) Yes indeed.
,KunfusedOne,2007-09-28T15:39Z,Anyone else have a problem with the DVD freezing at certain spots? Downloaded twice and it still freezes in all the same places. I even played the ifo file on the computer. Same thing. :(
,alenkr,2007-09-28T18:15Z,Try burn DVD at max 4x
[T],kef71,2007-10-02T13:30Z,KunfusedOne: Can you tell me which DVD it is and what episode? I think you might be referring to some badly NTSC 2 PAL conversion. There are a couple of scenes that has this problem and unfortunately you can't do anything about it...
[T],kef71,2007-10-02T17:51Z,I managed to put season 3 in the wrong category. You can find it here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3827142/Star_Trek_Voyager_Season_3
,tp4000,2007-11-26T01:06Z,"all trekkers dream........      the DL is so slow...

,lisa84,2007-11-28T21:27Z,Please seed!  Im am maxing my upload bandwidth right now..  !! 
,pmset2001,2008-03-26T15:00Z,"Are there any reasons why the sequences of the episodes are messed up? I mean episodes 121, 120, 117, 118, 122, 119, 123, do not seem to appear in the right order. 

Season 1 Disc 1: episode 721, 103, 104
Season 1 Disc 2: episode 105, 106, 107, 108
Season 1 Disc 3: episode 109, 110, 111, 112
Season 1 Disc 4: episode 113, 114, 115, 116
Season 2 Disc 1: episode 120, 121, 117, 118
Season 2 Disc 2: episode 122, 119, 123, 124"
,Sylevar,2008-10-16T17:07Z,that's because the number represents the recording (NOT THE AIRING) order.  The DVD shows you the episodes as they were aired.  If you'd pay attention to the extras you would know this.
,Pelle4495,2008-11-04T21:21Z,"Plese seed stuck at 75%
:-(( :-(( :-(("
,Stock84,2008-12-03T18:50Z,"yes, please seed. thank you!"
[V],Lindoff41,2008-12-09T08:38Z,"Väldigt bra kvalité, men ack så stora filer. Man måste ha dvd9 skivor för att kunna bränna......om man inte vill shrinka filerna. Det går ju det också på bekostnad av ljud och bild.
Men ett fantastiskt upplägg är det. Tack för det.

,Jack242,2009-01-06T22:47Z,Why nobody is seeding? I will finish in one year!^^
