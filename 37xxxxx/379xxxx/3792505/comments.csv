I'm trying to upload some of my own Albums I have that I see are hard to come by on the Internet but I'm not really sure how all this works. How do I keep it seeded? Where do I upload from?

This was a really slow download for me with 11 people seeding it I'm not sure If I'm doing something wrong or if its just slow but if you could explain to me how to take the download I got from you and upload it myself so its faster for other people that would be great "

Bloody happy to finally find this and I think half the songs are cut short. 

Just so you know Tonight, I'm Gone its meant to be 12:26 long not 5:01 why are you guys seeding this did non of you notice the missing parts in these songs..."
