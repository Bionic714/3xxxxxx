This is an unknown recording of the July 5th 2007 concert at the Orange Peel by The Smashing Pumpkins.

This torrent contains one iso file (disk 2 of a two dvd set) received by mail after buying the show on eBay from a bootlegger who violated the pumpkins' taping policy.

I know nothing off the equipment used to record or master these discs. I claim no responsibility for the quality (or lack) thereof.

disk one is posted elsewhere on this site.
