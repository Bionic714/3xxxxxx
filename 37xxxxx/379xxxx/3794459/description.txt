This is a collection of sound effects and music for halloween. 

All files are in FLAC format - let the whining begin! ;) 
MP3's are smaller but when working with fx you want to keep the sound quality as high as possible since you will be mixing many together. 
All are level 8 compressed. 
All have ID tag data filled so you can drop them right into your favorite music database.
Some are missing covers, they didn't have any worth scanning if they are missing.

These are all ones that I did not see in other torrents.
Of special interest are Eric Kunzel's Chiller CD. This is a good non-dancing party background cd of a lot of horror 

movie favorites.
Next are the the Big Scream CD's. These 4 are all 1 hour long, stereo mixed sound enviroments. Good for placing at specific points at your haunt. I am missing several of these - if you have them please upload!
The other CD's are various FX CD's from the halloween bins at various stores.

If you have any other good halloween music cd's or FX please upload them so we can all use them at halloween!

I have a slow connection - so please no complaining about how long it's taking. I will seed it until Halloween at least.
