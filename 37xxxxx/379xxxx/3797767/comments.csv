ou on peut avoir la version pal multi 5 with language french ... ??? "
,Osaka,2007-09-16T04:52Z,"in PAL huh?

I've downloaded the American (NTSC) version of Silmeria and burnt it on 6 DVDRs, in different ways, at slowest 
speed possible and in different burning programs and different DVDR makes (Verbatim and TDK, plus and minus)

But, the game _ALWAYS_ freezes at the *VERY FIRST* battle!
The battle doesn't even start, it just freezes right after you get the ""View Battle Tutorial?"" question.

Answering ""No"" or ""Yes"" makes zero difference!
Using a Dual Shock 1, or any other controller _DOES NOT_ help at all. 

I've even tried the JAPANESE version of the game (found on eMule) and it ALSO FREEZES...!

I've wasted 6 or so DVDRs on it already.

I'm going to dowload this and try... but it will probably freeze as well..!

I will not be the slightest surprised if it did...

My PS2 is slim, and has Crystal Chip 2.0 SLE

If someone knows that this version freezes as well, please report !
(i will, but i'm hoping someone else will - before i waste another DVDR)"
,Osaka,2007-09-16T22:38Z,"I've tested it now.

Guess what?

IT FREEZES!! __ ! LOOOOOL ! __

At the EXACT SAME SPOT.

The Japanese, American and European version are confirmed to NOT work.

Read the above post for more information."

,LaRD_mAsTeR,2007-09-21T21:41Z,"--Pero--.... it's ""have"" not ""heave"".... and the reason no ones helped you yet is probably because the game doesn't work for most people. it locks up after a short while of playing.

if you really want to try burn it anyway, just unrar and burn the iso with DVD Decrypter, Nero or CloneDVD2..... but it wont work so just dont bother.. i tried this torrent and another one.. there seems to be something special with Silmeria (maybe some sort of copy-protection?)"
,hostelowner,2008-07-04T19:22Z,"your supposed to play the game with a ps1 controller dont ask me why i dont know 
it freezes because of some stupid design 
the game as a copy needs a ps1 controller to work"
,vrul,2008-09-20T22:43Z,"asså seriöst ursäkta om jag KOMMER DAMPA LOSS NU MEN VAD I HELVETE ÄR DET FÖR FEL PÅ DET HÄR SPELET? 

hur får man skiten att funka, försöker spela de på ps2 emulator pcsx2.. har alla nyaste uppdateringar men när man försöker starta skiten så bara stängs den av, av sig själv

så ber någon väldigt snällt och vänligt om den förstår varför? och hur man kan fixa det"
,ecam,2009-01-25T08:02Z,"This game have problem with dual shock controller be it shock 2 or 1. Get a non dual shock ps1 controller or unplug your dual shock 2, power on, wait until it prompt for controller, insert the controller back and hopefully no freeze."
,brandcharl,2009-03-20T14:45Z,how can i seed
,worg3,2009-06-15T22:39Z,"....i have the game in spanish....so it cant load internet save files......
