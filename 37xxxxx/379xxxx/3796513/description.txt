Additional Comment: 

The deleted scenes varied in quality i have cleaned up as many as possible but there are still differences in the sharpness of some and the colour although this is only blatently obvious in a few scenes. all in all im extrmely happy with how this edit went and having access to the score really helped with a few of the trickier scenes. (many thanks DHR001!!) 

I have incorporated some experimental Fanedit liability protection (feedback on this would be highly useful) as well as the usual fanedit warning screen on insertion of the dvd there is also a check screen between the main menu and the movie which forces you to choose whether you own the movie or not. if you select no you get a small easter egg but cannot ultimately watch the movie as you are then returned to the 10 second warning screen. finally i have hardcoded "This is a Fanedit you must own the original to legally watch this movie" into the main movie stream right at the beginning. 


Time needed for the edition: Couple of weeks on and off (more on than off though)
