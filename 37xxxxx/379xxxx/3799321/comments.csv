,FatFuckFrank,2007-09-08T16:20Z,"OK, this is 1 of 7 of the infamous ""Guinea Pig"" movies; I'll be posting the others soon......

The Guinea Pig films (from the Japanese ""giniipiggu"") are a series of 1980s Japanese horror films with extremely detailed special effects.

 The tapes were catapulted to a new level of infamy in the late 1980s and early 1990s when the first five films of the series were found showcased in the 5,763 videotape collection of Japanese serial killer Tsutomu Miyazaki, who re-enacted scenes from the films as a part of his crimes. Because of the constant controversy surrounding the series, it has now been deemed illegal in Japan to produce any movies with the ""Guinea Pig"" label.

The first Guinea pig film, Za ginipiggu: Akuma no jikken (Devil's Experiment-1985), is allegedly a re-enactment of an actual snuff film. The film revolves around a group of men who kidnap and graphically torture a young woman as part of an experiment on the human body's threshold of pain.

Based on a manga by Hideshi Hino and directed by the mangaka himself, the next installment of the Guineapig series, Za ginipiggu 4: Manhoru no naka no ningyo (Mermaid in a Manhole-1988), is about an artist who is trying to cope with the recent death of his wife. One day while being in the sewers beneath the streets of Okinawa, he comes across a mermaid that he had met before when he was a kid, when the sewers used to be a big river. He sits down to paint her, but soon she starts crying in agony, and the painter notices that she has some kind of sores on her body. She has been stuck in the sewers for a long time and she must have been infected by the environment down there. The artist takes her back to his house, and after a brief period of time, the mermaid develops lacerations and begins to bleed. The artist uses the blood and pus from the wounds to paint her portrait, but as he paints, her condition worsens and she dies.

Za ginipiggu 5: Notorudamu no andoroido (Android of Notre Dame-1988) is about a scientist who tries to find a cure for his sister's grave illness. The scientist needs a ""guinea pig"" to perform experiments on. A stranger approaches the scientist with an offer of a body for the experiments. The scientist accepts and the stranger supplies the body for a price. The experiments do not go well and the scientist becomes enraged, hacking the body to pieces. The stranger approaches the scientist once again and supplies another body so the experiments can continue.

Za ginipiggu 6: Peter no akuma no joi-san (Devil Woman Doctor-1990) is the story about a female doctor who is a transvestite, played by real-life Japanese transvestite Shinnosuke ""Peter"" Ikehata. She mutilates and eventually kills all of her patients. This episode shifted the tone of the series from graphic horror to extremely violent slapstick comedy.

Za ginipiggu 7: Zansatsu supeshyaru (Slaughter Special-1992) is the seventh and final movie from the series. It works primarily as a ""best of"" special, showcasing the most gruesome moments from the first several films."
