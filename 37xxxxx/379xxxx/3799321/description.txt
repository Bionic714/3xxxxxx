Flowers of Flesh & Blood (1985), was also based on a purported snuff film, this one sent to one of the screenwriters. In it, a man dressed as a samurai drugs a woman and proceeds to cut her apart, and finally adds her body parts to an extensive collection.

After viewing a portion of this film, actor Charlie Sheen was convinced the murder depicted was genuine and contacted the MPAA, who then contacted the FBI. FBI agent Dan Codling informed them that the FBI and the Japanese authorities were already investigating the film makers, who were forced to prove that the special effects were indeed fake [2] [3] [1] (similar to what Italian film director Ruggero Deodato had to do with his film Cannibal Holocaust). The band Skinny Puppy wrote the song, "The Mourn," after discovering the video and believing it authentic. When they later learned it was a fake they incorporated clips of it into their live stage show.

"Flower of Flesh and Blood" was Tsutomu Miyazaki's (real life serial killer) favorite of the first five films, and the one which apparently served as one of his primary "blueprints" for his crimes.
