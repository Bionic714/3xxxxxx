Another swedish hardcore classic. Pushead, illustrator of bands such as Misfits and Metallica gave the band great reviews in Maximum rockn roll and let them appeare on the "Cleanse the BActeria" sampler. But sadly Mob 47 like very othe great 80s band broke up. And in the 90Â´s Distortion records lifted them into popularity again with re-releasing most songs on the CD garanterat mangel. This is the 2nd press of their first ep, released by Uproar records (later Burning Heart).
Today Mob 47 is around again, they have a myspace page of course. Kinda cool, uh!
