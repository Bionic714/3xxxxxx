,MisplacedFate1313,2008-05-27T04:45Z,"Would someone verify why this file is about 4 gigabytes than the other main 10th kingdom torrent?

If the quality is better than the other one, or is more complete, I obviously want to get this one. It also has a better seed to leech ratio.

Are there any reasons why the other one is more popular, despite having substantially less content?"
,sumdumnam,2008-06-26T19:49Z,"@MisplacedFate1313: looks like both were uploaded from the same fellow (the other a few months prior to this one).  these are DVD9 isos.  those are likely DVD5.  both have the same languages listed (spoken and texted).  this one specifies PAL, but as the other doesn't say, and lists the same texted languages, it's probably PAL too.

so probably, these are straight copies of the original discs, and those were slightly compressed to fit on DVD5 discs.  my advice?  if you have the hd space to download these, AND you can burn DVD9 (dual layer DVDR), OR you can't burn DVD9s but want to shrink them yourself, get these.  if you can't burn DVD9s, get the other."
