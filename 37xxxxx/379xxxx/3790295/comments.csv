,Zoracic,2007-09-23T07:43Z,No feedback on this share? It would be nice to hear what people think and it would make me upload more :-)
,geooeg,2007-09-25T09:51Z,"I haven't download this yet but i have seen the movie a long long time ago an I thought it was great but i couldn't find it anywhere (only in vhs ??? format). 

I hope the quality will be good. 

Thnx for the upload. It's hard to find non mainstream movies... ;)
Btw does someone have his new film?"

Amazing film."

,charro86,2012-08-07T03:35Z,"Fransmaas, it's probably because your media player doens't support non hardcoded subtitles (like *srt archives). Try with another media player. I suggest the Media Player Classic."
