,Waterloojock,2009-08-13T01:05Z,To the people who dislike Bon Jovi... If you dont like them.. then why are you on here looking at the torrent? 2nd.. Bon Jovi has been able to survive as a band for over almost 30 years. Where is your favorite band or artist? Have they made relevent music to span 3 decades?
,SNES_VS_PS1,2009-09-04T11:53Z,slippery when wet is one of the greatest albums ever!
,ryleebabe,2010-01-17T03:19Z,"Horrible! Many missing songs and albums. If you're looking for the FULL, COMPLETE discography don't waste your time here. You'll just spend hours trying to fill in the pieces."

,saftisch,2010-11-06T10:49Z,Many songs are missing. I wouldn't recommend this torrent.
,saikat7,2010-12-23T23:07Z,"Hey stupid, you forgot to add 2005 Have A Nice Day. It is one of his greatest album."
,nukles33,2011-02-27T11:26Z,good point
,AeroSS_87,2011-12-05T19:35Z,"Okay.  I like your strategy of neatly writing out the albums and years released in the description.  And for the most part, this is a great torrent with the exception the 2005 album missing.   However, I must ask WHY in the hell everything is in caps lock?  Nothing pisses me off more than that.  I have a nice library and all my folders sorted neatly I've spent alot of time creating and then THIS horseshit.  

I CAN SEE THE TITLES OF THE SONGS JUST FINE THERE'S NO NEED FOR YELLING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
