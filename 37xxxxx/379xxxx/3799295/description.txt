When rotted human remains wash up on a beach, the police are dispatched to investigate. Their searching leads them to the Eight Immortals Restaurant, with it's local proprietor Wong Chi Hang is the man behind it. But it seems Wong has ownership of the restaurant without proof, which leads one cop, above all his bumbling peers, to think there's more to Wong than he's willing to tell. As their investigation progresses, the cops find themselves on a missing persons case when the man who originally ran the restaurant and his entire family have just gone missing without a trace. The only man with knowledge of what happened to that family is Wong, who very well may be responsible for the disappearances of employees too, and what the cops must find, will be an unlikely horror they couldn't anticipate, of a far more dangerous man capable of doing even more evil acts, in the one thing no one had even thought about.
