1.install

2. Open Promt Folder located C:\Program Files\PRMT7

2. Open PROTECT folder, Open Register.exe

3. Open the other Register.exe located in your torrent downloaded folder

4. Type in the information it gives you for Product ID and Install Code

5. Hit Enter, and it will generate new numbers. Now right click and Select it all, Hit Enter (to copy it once it's selected) and paste that into a text pad or something so you can isolate and copy just the Product licese number, and the Access code, now paste those into their appropriate fields in your Register.exe (in PROTECT folder) and then hit register.

,Beaumont007,2012-08-03T16:32Z,"Hi,
Just installed the program. Seems ready to work except that a window pops up saying that it's ""verifying the Cd-rom"" (I made a virtual copy with Daemon Tools) and then it says ""This CD-ROM/DVD-ROM cannot be validated due to installed Copy Protection Emulation Solftware. (#10001)"". Where did I go wrong? Any help would be much appreciated! Thanx"
