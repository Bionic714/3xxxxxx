,robbo86,2008-06-04T10:56Z,Some of the tracks are missing from at least 2 of the albums.The Dungeons Are Calling has the 8th track missing (Sirens live) and Sirens has tracks 10 and 11 missing.Ive not looked through them all yet.Some artwork is there (mostly front covers)but on searching the net for back covers i noticed tracks missing.You can get them through limewire if need be.
,paradoxfox93,2008-11-23T09:21Z,"Frostwire GNU FTW 4 P2P  Always use open source freeware!

Savatage isn't all the easy to find on P2P well at least not the song I've been looking for...

Shotgun Innocence - The bonus track from  Poets & Madmen is missing :(
DO you know how hard this song is to find?  It was on the first Savatage Album I ever bought.  I haven't been able to replace it since.  My quest continues..."
