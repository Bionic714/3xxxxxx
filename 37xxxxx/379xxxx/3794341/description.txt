Savatage is a progressive heavy metal band founded by the brothers Jon and Criss Oliva in 1979. The band is known for recording many concept albums. Although they were known mainly as a progressive metal band, their origins could be attributed to classic heavy metal and power metal, as expressed by their debut album, Sirens. The band has been inactive since the release of its last album in 2001, and have not performed live together since 2002, instead concentrating on their more commercially successful side-project, the Trans-Siberian Orchestra.
