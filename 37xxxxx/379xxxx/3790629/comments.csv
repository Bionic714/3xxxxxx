REQ: Just one little request. If someone could take all the AF2 files (just the AFCAD files for airports) of Ultimate Traffic (for FS9) and upload them that would be great. I need more traffic at my airport and I don't know how to make AF2's. UT has shit loads of parking spaces all around at every airport. PLEASE!!"
