i found 11 viruses with AVG!"
,Krokkedille,2007-09-15T13:10Z,"I guess it is due to some ignorance among the people that they call out ""virus"" since it is the natur of these ""kind"" of programz that they activate antivirus-programz. It is hacker tools, boy´s, It goes with the territoria, if they didn´t you anti-vira was/is useless  "
,prometeu,2007-09-17T00:00Z,can u give me the source of the trojan that u used to infect these files? seems prety new one :)
,supermegeme,2007-09-20T15:00Z,"just for the record, if u have a seciurty system, it will detect it and remove it, u better turn it off, 
if your paranoid about it, u better save all the files onto a disk, and do not open the files! once done, turn off seruity (if it doesnt work, remove it). once open, u can do watever u want,
=p"
,unrar,2007-09-25T21:03Z,"these files will most definitely infect you. i downloaded the rapidshare link and ran a couple of the tools included in the package. my system went nuts a short time later. i deleted the files and ran anti-virus scan, and these programs had tried to infect both my mozilla firefox and my internet explorer. i was able to recover firefox, but internet explorer no longer works on my windows due to the fact that the exe file was replaced by the malicious software. do not download. i know what i am talking about. you have been warned."
,danzig-7766,2007-09-30T03:24Z,well fuck nut do you think mutiable ppl just write comments yelling trojan and virus for fun?
,sheerliberation,2007-10-01T06:34Z,"Of COURSE you found malware....
as it's comprised of...malware!
When in doubt, don't download."

,kammouflage,2008-01-30T06:27Z,"You have to understand... you are downloading tools to hack other systems... you do this via trojan server that is included in this pack that gets put on victem's pc.  this is why they keep saying ""turn off your security""  If you don't understand what you're doing and you install the server, it's your own damn fault your computer got fuxed.  If you don't understand this or are just paranoid... don't download it.  or do like i do with new tools, put them in a virtual machine, this way if there is an infection, it's your virtual machine that gets fuxed... reload the image and your back to good again."
,1ncendiary,2008-02-01T14:05Z,"judging by the comments that have been left (ie oh no! this is a virus! damn you! etc.. etc..)

,Troy123,2008-04-28T07:44Z,"Any one that bitch's about a virus or Trojans is a fucking stupid. In the explanation of the torrent he put
 *** Collection of Trojans/RAT's AKA ""Remote Admin Tools"" ***
and 
These tools let you encrypt ANY Type of detected malware eg.. Trojans/KeyLoggers/Malware/Virus etc.. and makes them 100% undetected
all remote admin tools are Trojans that work for you. You send them the clint side trojan (exe) after they execute it it opens a back door for you . So you can remote admin the computer, like send them viruses like a key logger. All Anti-V mark them as viruses and Trojans. Viruses and Trojans are just explodes of weaknesses in the system. If you download anything that has the word hacking in it you can bet your ass you will likely a viris or a trojan. If you do not, then downloaded a scanner brutforcer mail boomer or some shit  like that. All most all the best hacking tools have Trojans or viruses in them. 
Poison Ivy =trojan
sharK=trojan
Bifrost=trojan
Do you get the point.

So if u want to key log someone  "

[T],xenfreak,2008-07-05T06:11Z,"how about you n00bs don't download this torrent if you don't know how to deal with warez? some people, like me, can download this torrent without getting infected at all. maybe if you idiots did some research, you'd be able to do so too.

and LOL AVG is one of the n00biest AVP's out there. haven't used it in ages.

lastly, for all of you pathetic idiots who say ""zomg guis it has a virus!!!! babee jezuz is a fogzorz"" remember exactly what you want these tools to do. god, the stupidity of people."
,elite_man,2008-08-23T01:12Z,"so do trojans work across the internet, such as from my computer to someone else's computer on a completely different network?

or do they simply work on the same local area network? thanks :)"
,irishman76m,2008-10-23T04:45Z,"If you know what you are doing you would run these in a VC, but still the file MacAddressChanger.exe is a trojan dropper. 

The hack tools are explainable for being detected as that, as they are, but a MAC changer is more of a privacy tool, not in any way a hack tool, there is NO reason why it should be detected as that. When I launched it it attempted to invade several processes including windows explorer, there is NO reason for it to need to inject itself into windows explorer to change your MAC. It also recreated itself perpetually, I would delete the file and it would be back, over 100 times it did this (the report from kaspersky after the fact shows this), no legit file does that. It created a long string of folders under appdata, just a repitition of new folders named appdata which it hid at the bottom of (it looked like this ....\appdata\appdata\appdata\appdata\Macaddresschanger.exe) it had THIRTY folders that it created to try and hide itself deep. It required a restart to get rid of, this is BAD stuff, stay away. 

See this virustotal scan, as stated before hack tools of course will be detected, but a MAC changer isn't that complex of a program and it should not be considered harmful: http://www.virustotal.com/analisis/9797d9b24809395fd6bd1b90eeb7df78 31 out of 35 AVs detect it as bad, a MAC changer would in no way have behavior similar to a trojan dropper if you know anything about such things. 
Here is a threatexpert report: http://www.threatexpert.com/report.aspx?md5=f64e3b8400c382b2c67c93ac9114a4b3

The other programs so far as I can tell are fine, but this is just stupid. 

Call me stupid if you like, but you are the fool, in no way does a MAC changer behave like a trojan dropper and  N O  legitimate program recreates like that or creates folder strings like that."
,irishman76m,2008-10-23T04:48Z,"EDIT: Still overall not too bad, I was running in VMware so no big deal, hack tools are often infected, but the thing is, this isn't really a hack tool."

,agriwulf,2009-01-16T08:34Z,"No joke, irishman. A mac address changer shouldnt be detected as a trojan. I use vmware while scanning all this with nod32, one of the best AV out there. Unlike most others here, i have brains. And it pays to be less trusting in the world of anonymity."
,invisible_1,2009-02-08T21:43Z,"DO NOT USE www.virustotal.com !!! They send all information about the infected files to all AV's in just a few day became detected by all AV's.

you dont try to hack hackers, that will result in you getting pWn3ed.
