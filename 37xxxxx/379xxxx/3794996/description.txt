          *** Collection of Trojans/RAT's AKA "Remote Admin Tools" ***

 --Poison Ivy 2.3.0 RAT--

Poison Ivy is an advanced, firewall bypassing, reverse connection, remote administration tool.
The main features are Camellia encrypted communications (with 256 bit password), transparent compression of transfers and communications, 
full-featured file, registry, services and process manager, password manager, key logger, relay servers (socks 4 and 5, port redirect), 
remote screen capture, microphone capture and webcam viewing.

The server is only 7-9 KiB in size (depending on the settings), and due to the unique design concept, when a new version of Poison Ivy is released, 
you will hardly ever need to update the server to take advantage of the new features.
Also the whole server can be used in totally independent shellcode format, as exported by the builder.

 --sharK 2.4.0 RAT--

Here are some features of Shark-RAT:
Shark is an advanced remote administration tool written in VB6. With shark you will be able to administrate every PC in the world (using Windows OS) remotely. 

Here are some facts:

* Shark uses DS2 to encrypt the traffic 
* Shark is able to resume downloads and uploads when the server disconnects on the next connect 
* Compressed Transfers 
* Thumbnail Previews of Pictures 
* Key logger works with Keyboard hooking 
* You have a real DOS-Shell instead of dos-output like in the most rats 
* Interactive Process Blacklist 
* Virtual-Machine detection

 --ProRAT_2.0SE--


Exterminator technology: In the Server Builder (very useful to create codes to totally moderate the security system of the victim before installing the server). 
With Exterminator you can make your own XAF script files to bypassstopuninstall 
any security application in the victim system (antivirus, firewall, anti-spyware, folder protection, notifiers).Exterminator includes a very flexible scripting system 
with dozens of options for Professional users.

Exterminator Actions Files (XAFs): To learn how to use the Exterminator, the examples include ones for Kaspersky, McAfee and NAV 2007 editions.
Denial-Of-Service Attack feature: Which allows you to use your victim's systems to make attacks to internet websites remotely. This version added 1 more method.
Startup Bypass (SUB) option in the Server Builder: To bind the server with any of the startup items already in the victim system to totally trick the victim and startup monitors.
Firewall Bypass (FWB) option in the Server Builder: To inject the server in any running process and/or hide the server process from task managers
Damage functions including: Format Drives, Flood Drives, Delete Kernel files, and a new Plug-In for patching BIOS (may cause very much harm).
