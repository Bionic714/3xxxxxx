,AbrahamFan,2008-11-29T12:17Z,"Hi there! 

I've downloaded this and also win-rar - but I'm not sure how to extract the files. Sorry ... I'm not a wizz on the computer. 

Could someone advise me? Please send me a message if you can help.

Thanks a lot!

P.S. I did download other Artbeats from btjunkie, and they are .mov files and they opened up straight away."
