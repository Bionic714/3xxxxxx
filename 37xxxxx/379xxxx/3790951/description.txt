Overview:	After Bruce Lee's untimely death in 1973, and the global success of "Enter The Dragon", two 90-minute feature films were created to capitalize on Lee's worldwide stardom. The second of these films, "Fury Of The Dragon", was released theatrically in 1976.

Starring Bruce Lee as Kato and Van Williams as The Green Hornet, the 1960s crime-fighting duo--by day Britt Reid, publisher-editor of the Daily Sentinal, and his chauffeur-man servant Kato--battle relentlessly against the forces of urban evil.

This movie takes Kato and the Green Hornet on four epic adventures, including trying to stop a plot to oust a young prince of a foreign power and exposing two crooked cops, a case that leads to teh Green Hornet being wounded and then nearly killed. Kato and the Green Hornet are then pushed to the very limit by a well organized gang carrying out a million-dollar art heist, and using a fantastic ray gun to remove anyone in their path. Could this include our crime-fighting duo? Finally, the last adventure takes our heroes into the dark underworld of drug trafficking, testing all their skills in crime-fighting.

Edited with Bruce Lee's on-screen magnetism in mind, the film has an abundance of extra, spectacular fight scenes. "Fury Of The Dragon" represents one of the last unreleased Bruce Lee feature films, and is a must for all lovers of the martial arts and comic book heroes everywhere!
