I have tried everything I know to try and tweak it and speed it to the max but to no avail, still at the same speed. Any suggestions would be greatly recieved."
,2themax,2008-02-25T06:06Z,i'm just happy your still seeding. my install dic is no longer working but i have all my saved files. i'm hoping to d/l this before it's no longer available.
,mushroom63,2008-03-04T21:24Z,I am unable to get this to work - Disk 3 (Courses) writes to a folder on the CD rather than as an autorun cd advice please
,kuben22,2008-03-29T22:31Z,I had the same problem mushroom63. When it asks you to to choose on what disc it lies on (in my case on F:) just click on the disc where it lies and choose the map that pops up under it.
,rancid_b,2008-04-20T12:09Z,"heres a workaround for the disc 3 problem. extract the image to your computer, then burn the files in the tiger woods disc 3 folder, making sure you name the cd ""COURSES DISC"". see the original torrent has that disc 3 folder made into an image rather than disc 3 itself if that makes sense.

works like a charm :)"
,doctorBow,2008-05-21T21:14Z,I have Vista. Does anybody know if it works using this platform aswell or does it only work for XP?
,rwood,2008-10-15T05:40Z,"I am having trouble getting the game to work. When i start the game its asks for me to insert the courses disc and i use the same disc i used for installation but no dice, any suggestions?"
,hectorhaas,2008-12-18T16:48Z,"I did what rancid_b did and it worked perfectly. Extract file, open folder, make image from all the files in the folder, make sure to name both the save file and the image file as COURSES DISC, and alles ist gut! Enjoy the game!"
,Nyrra82,2008-12-20T22:30Z,"In case you donÂ´t wanna waste a cd for burning a copy of the third disc you can just click abort when asked for disc 3, then you will be able to browse the path of disc 3. Worked fine for me!"

Pc game tiger woods pga tour 2005 with crack"
,fmouse,2012-02-03T04:10Z,"Thanks. This torrent does indeed work. You must recreate an ISO image (or burn a real CD) from Disc 3, and also copy a cracked game .exe from Disc 1.  

Use ImgBurn. Add all files inside the folder ""Tiger Woods Disc 3"" from this torrent's third disc, but not the folder itself. (This means for example TW2004.exe and data1.cab will be in the root directory of the new CD). Make the file system ISO9660 + UDF. Give the new ISO/disc the label COURSES_DISC for ISO0660 and COURSES DISC for UDF.

Save as an ISO file and mount with Daemon Tools or whatever Virtual CD program you use. This disc will let you complete installation and start the game after installation.

Remember, there is a cracked TW2004.exe on Disc 1 you must copy to your completed installation folder before the game will work. No one on this page has mentioned it yet."
,planestake,2012-02-23T20:50Z,"Thx to fmouse for the well spoken, detailed instructions. I finally got the game installed and copied the crack to the bin folder inside the installation folder (is that where it goes?)anyway when I insert disk 1 and select ""play game"" nothing happens...if anyone knows what I did wrong plz post!! thx all and i'll keep seeding this for a bit"
,esbornia,2012-07-17T02:29Z,Thanks a lot!
