,lereer,2007-09-09T22:15Z,"Hello! I have downloaded  adobe but i cant run the program because it`s saved as a ISO file. What should I do??

,creative1seed,2007-09-10T23:53Z,"lereer.. you should download nero cracked and it alows you to unzip the ISO file as a IMAGE,"
,benriz,2007-09-13T13:57Z,"Is very good program but requires ""qualifying product"" to upgrade"
,christian_vii,2007-09-13T19:59Z,"Hi lereer! Check out the following link and download a DAEMON emulator (freeware):

After installation you can mount the iso image into the emulator and you can run it as if it were a DVD-ROM."
,jÃ¤rnladyn,2007-09-15T13:55Z,Tackar!
,alan9999,2007-09-20T19:33Z,Installed and cracked - good effort stripey. But what to do about the activation? I have thirty days... then what? Do I just activate online?
,stripey,2007-09-23T04:03Z,Hmm...you should have the full version if you used all the cracks...maybe try them again or re-install?? Maybe someone else has a better idea.
,talynsar,2007-09-25T02:11Z,"Try this....

install the 30 day trial version, activate online.  Once it comes back and tells you that you need to do phone activation follow these steps:

1) hit the phone activation button
2) copy/paste the activation number they give you (the one you would have to read to the person on the phone)
3) paste that into the bottom most space on your keygen
4) hit the genkey button (the middle button)
5) hit the activate button on the bottom left of the keygen window
6) type the number you just had generated into the activation code on the Adobe window.

I just tried this and it worked.   I won't take credit...I found the directions here:

,ARTHURTSE882,2007-09-28T15:22Z,tks talynsar it works
,marcf28,2007-10-07T15:28Z,"Okay - I couldn't get that to work, but I did have version 5. Entering the serial from that worked fine. If it helps anyone - here it is:

Serial #: KWW500R7150122-128

When you get to the 'ugrade' window, set the version to Acrobat 5 (if it isn't already) and use that serial.

Thanks stripey - it works great now."
,undray,2007-10-10T14:04Z,"Talynsar, your instructions proved very helpful. Everything works fine now!"
,izaollie,2007-10-24T20:56Z,"Thankx Talynsar, your method worked like a charm"
,venrik,2007-10-25T22:40Z,"I tried to install this on a computer with Windows XP SP1, but the installation program tells me that I need another version. Is that true or is there any way to get around that problem? Do you happen to know what I could download instead to make it work? Thanks a lot! / Henrik"
