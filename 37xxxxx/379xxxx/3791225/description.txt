This Shadowbane Installer has the latest files as of Patch 20 (June 2007) for the Windows operating system. This is not a true installer but rather a zip I made of everything you need created by the WinZip Self-Extractor Personal Edition utility.

This will install in the default path of C:Program FilesShadowbane unless you change it.

Once installed, I recommend you run the SBConfig.exe utility found in the root installation directory of Shadowbane (default: C:Program FilesShadowbane). This will set up all of your configuration options prior to launching the game and won?t require a restart of the client to have them working.

Once that is done, I?d recommend making shortcuts to the Shadowbane.exe and sb.exe files; both found in the root directory of Shadowbane.

One last thing to note, this installation contains a few End-User Interface Skins: the Default Skin, the Veteran?s Layout, the Minimal Skin, and the Vengeance UI.
