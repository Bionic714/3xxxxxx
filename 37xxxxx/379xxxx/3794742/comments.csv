Try The Google:
uTorrent or Azureus and portforwarddotcom"

,Barbados^,2007-12-10T00:14Z,"Dear MayorSlack,
Oh dear, I've looked for Woop Woop for ages and was so excited when I found it here but it looks like we're all stuck at 58.4%.  Would someone pleeeeease seed long enough for us to finish?  I promise I'll stay and seed for a long time after I get it.  Pretty please?  (By the way, I'm using uTorrent and my ports are forwarded and I get pretty good speed for ADSL.)"
,Barbados^,2007-12-14T13:02Z,"I got it, I got it, I got it!  It looks pretty good quality too!   Thank you all soooo much."
,semick,2008-01-07T06:03Z,"I absolutely love this movie, could only find it on VHS so I hope this is a DVD rip.  Otherwise I still thank you for saving me the time of capturing and converting etc.

Thanks"
