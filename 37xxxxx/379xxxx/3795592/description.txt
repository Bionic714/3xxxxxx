Curtis is the third studio album by rapper 50 Cent.
The album will be released on September 11, 2007.
Initially, 50 Cent's 2007 album was supposed to
be Before I Self Destruct, however, he decided to
push back its release date to 2008, and to release
Curtis in 2007 instead.

The album's title was changed twice. The first time,
it was changed from "Curtis" to "Curtis S.S.K.".
The "S.S.K.", which stood for "SoundScan Killer",
was intended to show the pressure 50 Cent feels to
succeed. The second time, it was changed back to
"Curtis".

In July 2007, Kanye West changed the release date
of Graduation, his third album, from September 18, 2007,
to the same release date as Curtis, September 11, 2007.
This means that the albums will go head-to-head and
compete for better sales against each other. 50 Cent
claimed that if Graduation sold more records than
Curtis, he would stop releasing solo albums.
However, he later dispelled his comments.
