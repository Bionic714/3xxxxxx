IN THE OLDER VERSION OF The Best of Guitar Hero 1, 2 (from PS2 and X360) and Encore 80, IT WAS A LOT OF BUGS. IN THIS VERSION 1.40 ALL FINDED BUGS WERE FIXED.

The main bugs were:
- There is not BASS in Holy Diver (Dio) and Misirlou (Dick Dale);
- In the shop, some char in OUTFITS freezen. 
These bugs were fixed, and there is some news.

News in this version:
- Metal Health - Quiet Riot is from Guitar Hero 2 Demo disc. In this version there is an other guitar solo.
- It was included Trippolette (a good and hidden track from GH1) and Play With Me, played by Extreme.

Musics are work fine in all levels, in all modes (CO-OP, FACE-OFF and Pro-FACE-OFF).

Musics and Group names are changed.

Chars of: Axel, Pandora, Izzie and Grim are from GH Encore 80.

To save space were deleted video bonus, practice mode and intro. Because this, it were applied \"Never Fail\" cheats in all levels.

You are able to use the practice mode in TRAINING just in normal speed.

Tanks to: Cristiano, John Hawk, Bootmaker, Jack Thompson and Ozzyman.
