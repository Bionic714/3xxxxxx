,IamLemmy,2007-09-07T17:38Z,"THE OLDER VERSION OF The Best of Guitar Hero 1, 2 (from PS2 and X360)
and Encore 80, HAS A LOT OF BUGS. IN THIS VERSION 1.40 ALL FOUND BUGS
WERE FIXED.

The main bugs that were fixed:
- There is not BASS in Holy Diver (Dio) and Misirlou (Dick Dale);
- In the shop, some char in OUTFITS frozen.

News in this version:
- Metal Health - Quiet Riot is from Guitar Hero 2 Demo disc. In this version there is an other guitar solo.
- Trippolette (a good and hidden track from GH1) and Play With Me, played by Extreme was included.

Musics are working fine in all levels and in all modes (CO-OP, FACE-OFF and Pro-FACE-OFF).

Musics and Group names were changed.

Chars of: Axel, Pandora, Izzie and Grim are from GH Encore 80.

To save space video bonus, practice mode and intro were deleted. That's why ""Never Fail"" cheats in all levels were applied.

You are able to use the practice mode in TRAINING only in normal speed."
,IamLemmy,2007-09-07T19:34Z,"When you fix a bug, you make a new bug. Sucks!

First Bug Report:
Tattooed Love Boys was replaced by Trippolette. Because this, there are 2 Trippolette in this version. Sucks and sorry!

Well... this is not a big trouble. :-)"
,tattoodude75,2007-09-10T21:34Z,how do you get it to work on the ps2??? Please leave info on how to do it. Thanks...
,IamLemmy,2007-09-10T22:20Z,"First step: unrar these 33 files
Second step: burn the guitarheroBestof.iso image using DVD Decrypter or ImgBurn in 4x.
It is Done!

But, you will need a PS2 modchiped or Swap Magic software.

Good Luck!"

,mrspock09,2007-09-29T05:37Z,"hey IamLemmy, i had some other questions for setting up my guitar hero torrent, and i think it would be easier to talk about it on msn/aim. my msn is guitargod2291@hotmail.com if you can get a hold of me"
,IamLemmy,2007-10-02T01:03Z,"Mr. Spock, I wrote a message to you including a little and clear tutorial. If you have and doubt, call me."
,IamLemmy,2007-10-02T01:06Z,"Well, your e-mail don´t work. I will try to copy the tutorial here. It was copy and paste from another torrent site.

All right. File(s) prepped and ready. Now how do I make the .torrent file?

Creating a .torrent file can be done through a number of common BitTorrent clients. Read the appropriate section below to create your .torrent file:

1) This is a guide explaining how to upload torrents using the BitTorrent client Azureus.

    * On the File menu, click ""Create a Torrent"".
    * In the ""Announce URL"" box, type ""http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce"".
    * Click the ""Browse"" button, find the file/folder you want to share, and then click ""Next"".
    * Name the .torrent file which will be created (this is what users will see in their BitTorrent client when they download the file), and click ""Finish"".
    * Voila, the torrent will be created in the location you specified. 

2) This is a guide by startreker explaining how to generate a .torrent file using µTorrent

    * On the file menu, click 'Create new torrent' (or press )
    * Click on either 'add file' or 'add directory' depending on what you want to upload, then browse to the folder or file.
    * Under 'Torrent Properties' in the 'Trackers' window put this tracker: ""http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce""
    * Optionally, add a comment in the 'comment' section.
    * Leave the 'Piece Size' at default, make sure the 'start seeding' checkbox is unchecked, and the 'private torrent' checkbox is checked.
    * Click the 'Create and save as' button. A progress bar will appear.
    * When it is done, it will pop up with a 'Select where to save the .torrent' window. Just name the torrent something that makes sense and click 'Save'. 

3) This is a guide by verve explaining how to generate and upload a torrent using the official bittorrent client BitTorrent 3.4.2.

    * Go to the menu ""File-->Generate Torrent File..."".
    * In the ""Tracker URL:"" field, type ""http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce"".
    * Drag n' drop the target folder from your Desktop into the little squared window you see over the ""Generate...""-button, after that you can see the path of your folder. Make sure the ""Make a torrent for each file/folder within this folder..."" box is unchecked.
    * Click on ""Generate..."" and select the place and name you want the new torrent file to be saved. Click on ""Save"". When generating has finished, close the generate window. 

Okay, I finished creating the torrent file. How do I upload the torrent to the tracker and begin seeding?

    * Login to the site and click on the ""Upload Torrent"" link.
    * In the ""Torrent file"" area, click the ""Browse"" (or ""File"") button, find the torrent file, and then click ""Open"".
    * In the ""Torrent name"" box, type a descriptive name. This is the name users will see when browsing the downloads section. Do not tag the torrent description with your name, the release date, compression ratio, or any other information: this information will be automatically appended by the selections from the ""Genre"" field.
    * Select a ""Category"" from the drop-down list. You will select Games -> PS2.
    * In the ""Description"" area, type a thorough description of the torrent. Make sure the description is complete and includes all relevant information, possibly including:
          o a brief description of what is cotained in the torrent,
          o how to properly use the torrent's contents (including any necessary extraction, installation and configuration instructions),
          o external links or quotes of reviews -- possibly even providing one yourself,
          o links to related torrents. 
    * Review the fields for correctness; then type the code and click the ""Upload"" button (if it dindn´t work in the first time, return and type again the new code).

It is ready!

But, if the torrent is not in your torrent client, then make a backup of your files and read the next step:

    * Finally, and this step is very important: re-download the .torren"
,mrspock09,2007-10-13T16:59Z,ok IamLemmy i just uploaded it and hopefully it'll work for everyone. you should check it out and let me know what you think!

,lec666,2007-11-24T01:11Z,is the neverfail cheat always on ? can it be turned off  ?
,lec666,2007-11-24T15:39Z,"what i really enjoy about this burn is how fun the tracks are to play. i grew listening to this stuff
and it takes me back to playing air guitar to cassette tapes...lmao"
,kekexugirl,2007-12-31T09:21Z,"i have absolutely no idea how to make a game dvd out of this in general. so here's what i got, help me from here

I downloaded RarZilla to unrar some stuff. What do I do next?

How do I burn something from dvd decrypter, I've had that for at least a year and was never able to burn something from it. I usually use my nero to burn ISO's will that work too?
So IamLemmy can you give us a step by step for those completely devoid of the near hacker status.....plzzz"
,ricky4502,2008-03-02T20:28Z,"Awesome list, i was planning to do the same by making a custom version with the best songs, however, my plan was to replace the vgs files with the songs from the original artists... unfortunately i can't do that because some of the songs in gh are shorter than the originals... and i'm not a chart editor type of guy, not yet

so thanks a lot for this awesome list, though i might have to replace a few... oh yeah and thanks for getting the trooper on here!"
,ashleighriot,2008-04-07T16:12Z,"Hi Lemmy, 
I have been downloading torrents for the past three days, trying to get the 360 songs and the Quiet Riot song.  But none are seeding.  I can't download any of these, yours included.  Dude, I am desperate.  I don't suppose u could please send me the songs through some other way.  Even if you don't, could you please respond.  Just a simple yes or no would suffice.  Thanks in advance man."
,ricky4502,2008-04-08T09:19Z,"one of the songs, i can't remember which one, isn't what it says on here... instead the song ""Let's Talk About Me"" by the Alan Parsons Project is on here... good song, but i don't believe it's on any of the guitar heros

I should also note that i can't buy the last 3 bonus songs, the game freezes when at the store when i try to either get to the last song or the 3rd to the last... i changed some songs here and there with some other songs i like more from the other GH games, and for the majority of them i replaced the music with the originals so my 1st thought was that maybe i can't get the last 3 songs to work was because of the preview times, so i fixed them, tried the game again and i still get the same problem

i've even tried to replace them with the original last 3 bonus songs from GHII (trigodor, x-stream, yeswecan) and gave them their old preview times, still no luck... it's just those last 3 songs that i have problems with"
,rennatofilho,2008-07-15T23:09Z,"Thanks man, I've download the game and it works fine. 
Is the best guitar hero hack ever! 
You can download it without fear"
,che_dylon,2009-04-02T00:03Z,"heyy can anyone tell me if this game is based in guitar hero 2 or 3 ??

thx"
