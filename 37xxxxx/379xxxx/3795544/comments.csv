,Bloody100,2007-10-15T07:33Z,"Verbato, you have just identified yourself, without the shadow of a doubt, as a truth-twisting neocon think-tank clerk. Enjoy your pay-cheques as long as you can..

To the others out there: this film is a massive historical document. It has won several world-wide awards, incl. from the Chicago International Film Festival.

,fisIvinden,2007-12-08T23:46Z,"Verbato.. If you not a ""truth-twisting neocon think-tank clerk"", as bloddy100 pointet out you may wery well be.. Did you even see the film?  

""It's not very difficult to be so when you own all the media.""  ??"
,Locobox,2008-05-08T14:06Z,"I Really Appreciate this upload is an important and serious documentary.

Thanks a lot."
,eraist,2008-08-07T07:07Z,"Verbato...  You would be wise to make sure your comparisons line up.  Hitler cared not a whit about capitalism.  Also, once Hitler won power he altered the democratic system to an authoritarian system that guaranteed he would stay in power as long as he ruled the nazi party.  As far as I have understood what is going on in Venezuela, Chavez has done no such thing and if someone the people think is better comes along, they can vote for that person.  If you ask me, what the US government has done with the so-called 'patriot'  act is closer to things the nazis did than anything Chavez has done or is doing."
,eraist,2008-08-07T07:11Z,"Furthermore, the idea that someone should be ""locked up and jailed for life"" because you believe they have a particular ideology is frightening.  I can only hope that people in positions of power do not have similar beliefs."
,beraq,2009-06-18T12:28Z,"ohh dear Verbato. How ignorant can you be? Didn't your mother ever tell you not to talk about things you have no knowledge of. I suggest you watch the film, you might learn something. While you're at it, go to your local library and borrow some books on German National Socialism and some on Venezuelan politics. If you're not willing to do that or don't like books without pictures then please refrain from posting comments. Spend your time doing something you enjoy, like jerking off to videos of George W Bush. "
