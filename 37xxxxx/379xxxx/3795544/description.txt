The Revolution Will Not Be Televised (Chavez Ã¢?? Inside the Coup) shows events before and leading up to the coup, the coup itself and the rise of peoples resistance to regain their democratically elected President.

Seven months before the coup, a group of Irish film makers had arrived to Venezuela with the intention of making a documentary about Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez; going beneath the layers of myth rumor that surrounded this Latin American leader.  In nineteen ninety eight President Hugo Rafael Chavez Frias was democratically elected with a never seen before support this time really from the population of Venezuela, not the traditional oligarchy nor private corporate interests.  Chavez stood as a controversial figure, his views on U.S. Imperialism and its form of government from the historical character Simon Bolivar the man who liberated Venezuela in the 19th century.

By nationalizing the Venezuelan oil, he had set himself in coalition course with the U.S., and by socializing big extensions of land previously owned by 15% of the population (the traditional Bourgeois) hew set a powerful group against him.  In April 11th the opposition with help and sporing of Washington they plot a plan for a coup d'etat against democracy;  during the next two days every mean for democracy was shut down.  But the people of Venezuela re-wrote history by defeating the coup with the important support of the Bolivarian Armed Forces.
