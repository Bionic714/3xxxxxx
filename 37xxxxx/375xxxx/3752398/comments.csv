This torrent is password protected... dont download it"
,mojojojobadazz,2007-09-23T18:18Z,In response to Kylra.How can this torrent be passworded.First of all its an .avi  not a .RAR.I'm downloading right now and am at 55% and going strong.Whether or not its the actual episode or a working video file remains to be seen so please stop leaving BS comments to discourage everyone else if theres no good reason to.

,Silwerwing,2008-03-22T22:39Z,"Does anyone got the old tv-serie, the one from 1976-1978.

I never knew that there was an TV-serie before I heard about this one, I have seen the pilot of the old TV-serie and 1 double episode (both released on VHS as a stand alone movie). It would be fun to have the complete old tv-serie."
