Got these from the TaultUnleashed Forums. Good guides and the Meta Map coords are awesome!

- Joanas 1-70 Leveling Guide w/ Metamap coords (http://www.joanasworld.com/)

- Brian Kopp's 1-70 Alliance Guide w/ Metamap Coords (http://www.briankopp.com/)

- Penn's World Alliance Leveling Guide (http://www.pennsworld.com)

I can't remeber the poster's name, but thanks to him anyway.
This is one of the better DL's of these files. Was said to be the latest.
