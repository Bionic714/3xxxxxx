,jenkat,2008-09-28T11:27Z,"Thank you for having the Japanese Pokemon episodes!

If you could please seed this torrent, that would be great.

Stuck at 99.9%, and like serchan before me, also just missing small pieces of episode 452 and 466. Was also checking the swarm, and it seems like there are a bunch of other people who also are at 99.9%. =("
,aoimizuno,2009-01-06T10:17Z,Please seed. Everyone is stuck at 99.9% Currently counting 15 people stuck at 99.9%. HALP! I really want to finish downloading so I can help seed and unstuck everyone. Please help. Thanks. @_@

,aoimizuno,2009-02-02T01:57Z,I've been stuck at 99.9% for over 2 months now. -_- I want to help but I can't. So far I've seen around 20-30 ppl with the same problem in the swarms. Someone please please seed.

,Natan_The_6th,2009-03-22T12:29Z,"pffff, downloading for more than a half year... 99.9% PLEASE SEED SOMEONE!!!!"
,Ty82000T,2009-04-15T14:50Z,"Well, first of all, why don't you guys just download 452 and 466 from a different site (There are other places you can get those episodes).

Secondly, unless you plan on watching the english version, I hope you're fluent in japanese. Only 436, 437, 438, and 468 have subtitles. And, 439-465 are raw (Meaning there isn't any subtitles or english audio track) By the way, in case you didn't know, starting this season, all of the American voice actors have been changed. This made it nearly unwatchable for me (as they were all horrible). I'd usually watch the english dub because I don't like having to pay attention to the bottom of the screen more than the center, but in this case, subtitles are much better. 

The good side to this was the download speed (1-1.3 MegaBYTES per second. That's like 1000-1300 KB/s)

I guess I'll just have to look for subtitles on the internet..."
,BuZero,2009-05-20T17:36Z,"MSV, whats up? Whats goin on?
Everyone here is stuck at 99.9. Care to seed for a bit? Seriously man.

I am using a SeedBox and I always upload to at least a 10:1 ratio.
That ISNT very hard when I've got a 100Mbit Line..."
,aoimizuno,2009-06-22T18:07Z,"Thanks so much to whoever seeded!!! ^^ I really appreciate it and I will help seed for a long time to come. :D 

@Ty8200T: I've actually tried looking for 452 and 466 at different sites. I'll searched every site, torrent and irc channel I could think of to no avail. :( I am also trying to watch all of these in raw Japanese. Subtitles are a nice brownie but I just wanna watch the Japanese version. The regular dubs are EVERYWHERE on the net. I think everyone downloading this specifically wanted the Japanese version for one reason or another, subs or no subs. :) We know what we're downloading. We're not retarded. Thanks for the explanation though! ^_^"
,VaZZioS,2010-03-19T07:20Z,"Let's seed these pokemon torrents guys, this is a treasure that's difficult to find. I finished Pokemon Housou with almost zero seeds and I'm seeding (even if my upload speed sucks)."
