could you consider share the prior one too? (Revolved i.e.)"
,NeverTheSame,2007-09-16T10:39Z,"Hey dude, I meant to respond to this sooner. I've got the tracks for Revolved, but only in 192kb/s. I don't know if it was ever released in a higher res. I've contacted Chris (ccc) about getting higher res files. I'll wait for a response before I post anything!"
,mp3rules,2007-09-20T14:24Z,cool man! & thx in advance!
,rehn,2007-10-17T01:46Z,192kb/s sounds fine to me. pleeeaase post!! thx
,NeverTheSame,2007-10-24T18:48Z,"Alright, I'll take another look at it tonight. I'm not sure why, but every time I try to create a torrent for that album, TPB says the torrent file is invalid. It's pretty weird."
,mp3rules,2007-10-27T22:21Z,really hope you'll succeed!
,HenryTheHorse,2007-12-15T09:19Z,"Nice to have all the music I love all in one place!!!  MUHAHAHAHA!!!!  ;-D

Seriously, this is good stuff have on while you're sitting in front of a computer all day.  =)"
,deadwhitehorse,2008-02-22T20:57Z,This work is brilliant! Is the re someone who knows where I can find the Beatles' instrumentals used in this LP?
,NeverTheSame,2008-02-28T01:36Z,"I really don't know. I'm pretty the way Chris (ccc) did this record was by manipulating the tracks digitally to isolate the vocals as much as possible.

If you're asking where to find the backing tracks for Sgt. Pepper, I would imagine only EMI and Sir George Martin have access to them. If you want to know the samples used on this CD, they're all listed in a .txt file included in the torrent."
