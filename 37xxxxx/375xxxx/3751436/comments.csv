,Kjelsaasbjornen,2007-09-16T19:43Z,The only thing u have to do in order to seed is to keep ur torrent program running and leave the files alone.

,drakewn,2008-01-10T04:59Z,"Hey Adnup.... use the Divx player version 6.6 or newer to burn avi video, then get yourself a dvd player that is Divx compatible."
,JustInsideTheGates,2008-01-15T21:31Z,"jagduger93 just leave the torrent open when done and it will be seeded by itself... 

i was wondering if anyone who gets this can start a torrent with just season 3 as the one with demonoid is now down... and the individual episodes are great but a lot are missing...

email me at justinsidethegates@gmail.com so i can be the first to dl and help seed...

thnx to whoever can help us out. 

"
,Djrelmz,2008-01-23T09:03Z,"@Justinsidethegates:  You can choose download only season three if you want... no need for a new torrent.  If you are using Azereus(which you should because it gives you the most amount of control over your files) just double click the torrent for entourage, a new tab opens.  click on the ""files"" tab.  highlight every file you DO NOT want to download.  right click on these highlighted files.  it will open a menu where you right clicked.  mouse over ""set priority"".  then click on ""do not download"""
,Djrelmz,2008-01-23T09:17Z,"Wow... this is ridiculously slow for ten people seeding....  seriously, people need to remove their upload cap.  It only does YOU harm in the end.  People should be BANNED for capping their upload.  Yeah, thats right. I'm talking to all you thirteen year olds and dumbasses everywhere.  Seriously... educate yourself!!!!"
,JustInsideTheGates,2008-01-23T23:08Z,hey sry but i was using bitcomment and it blows not letting u pick and choose what ur dling.... since started using bittorent 6.0 and i've figured out whats going on... thnx tho djrelmz

,easydoesit36,2009-02-22T00:25Z,"No guarantees, but for those of you worrying about getting suspended over downloading movies, try a program such as Peer Guardian and leave it running when your Bit Torrent client is running. They update frequently and block a lot of ISP's. 

P.S. - It's always the crappiest movies that end up landing you the dreaded notice. I got one a couple years ago for ""Alpha Dog"".

Good luck to all! "
