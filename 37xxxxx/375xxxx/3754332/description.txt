EDVARD GRIEG (1843-1907), the foremost Scandinavian composer of the late 19th century, has become the very symbol of Norway in the realm of music by virtue of his distinctively Norwegian tonal language. He built up a reputation as one of the leading composers of his time and as a pianist and conductor. He had an extraordinary public appeal - always ovations whenever he gave concerts - but also got the highest praise from the critics. 

In the beginning of this century, Edvard Grieg recorded a few of his own compositions - both on gramophone and with the Welte Mignon technique. This CD contains nine gramophone recordings made in Paris in April 1904, and four Welte Mignon recordings made in Leipzig in 1906.

It is difficult to evaluate Grieg's manner or ability as a pianist just from listening to these recordings. They were made towards the end of his life, and at this time he was weak, often unable to sleep, and beginning to show his age. Nevertheless, the recordings give a very good impression of a pianist with his own style, filled with charm - impulsive and distinctively romantic in expression as it was. Especially the interpretation of Butterfly and Little Bird gives a very good example of both of the pianist's ability  and the simple beauty and poetry in his "Lyrical Pieces". 
Due to modern technology, a digital system called NoNoise, much of the surface noise has been removed from the gramophone recordings without affecting the instrumental sound.
