,Tronglonok,2007-08-02T21:50Z,How do you get this to work on XP? =\
,khyrre,2007-08-02T22:04Z,"DOSbox works pretty well for all of them: http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/

For Ultima VII parts 1 and 2, Exult is pretty much the best: http://exult.sourceforge.net/

For Ultima IV, the xu4 engine will make it work: http://xu4.sourceforge.net/

Also for Ultima IV, this 256-color graphics update is nice: http://www.moongates.com/u4/upgrade/Upgrade.htm"
