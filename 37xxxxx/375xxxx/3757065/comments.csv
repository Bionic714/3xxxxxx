,Fordor_Baggins,2008-09-07T08:19Z,"Download was quick, Program seems okay, BUT according to Avast 4.8 one of the keygens has this trojan: win32:Delf-LCQ (Drp). 

No idea what it does yet, other than it being a backdoor. Not impressed."

,theospider,2008-10-26T05:37Z,the key gens are always gonna come up as some kind of spy ware or virus its the way the code is written to an anti virus it looks evil when its not
