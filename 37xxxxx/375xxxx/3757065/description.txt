Acronis Disk Director Suite 10.0 is a comprehensive workstation partition and disk management suite that combines a number of previous Acronis products into one solution:

- Acronis Partition Expert ? Resize, move, copysplit, and merge partitions without losing your data

- Acronis OS Selector ? A multi-boot software utility that allows you to install multiple operating systems on your PC

- Acronis Recovery Expert ? Recover accidentally lost or deleted partitions

- Acronis Disk Editor ? A disk drive repair tool that allows you to perform advanced operations on your hard disk drive, such as restoring boot records and hexadecimal editing

Acronis Disk Director Suite is the ideal tool in the combination with Acronis True Image backup. Here's how you can take advantage of these two products together:

- Create individual partitions for your system and your data using Acronis Disk Director Suite. 

- Image your system partition using Acronis True Image only before applying system changes, such as installing new software and the like. 

- And create daily (or as often as you need) data backups from your data partition by selecting the specific data files you need to backup. 

- Thus, using the combination of two great Acronis products you will always have an image of your system and backup of your data. This will greatly save you time and reduce your storage requirements.
