I can't get zero hour to work though, it asks me for the dvd. Do I need to burn a copy of the zero hour-file?"
,luddelump,2007-07-31T14:10Z,Just mount ut with toast should do it.

,i_never_existed,2007-08-01T06:21Z,"Does this work on Intel?? or G4/5???

Just changed to macbook and not sure what games work here."
,fnyzzel,2007-08-01T09:57Z,"System Requirements

Mac OS X 10.2.6 or later
PowerPC G4/G5, 1 GHz or faster
256 MB of RAM
1.6 GB free disk space
3D Graphics Acceleration required (ATI Radeon 7500/nVidia GeForce 2 or better, 32 MB of VRAM)
DVD drive required to install and play
Network play Mac to Mac only, GameRanger supported

I don't know what version this is, but the initial release of the game was certainly no universal binary. Which means it won't run very fast on an intel mac. I don't know if there's a universal patch available though. A lot of old software has been updated to run natively on intel during the last year."
,uberben,2007-08-05T09:30Z,Generals works fine but when I try and mount Zero Hour I get an error 'Invaild Checksum' and the same when I try and mount it with Toast. Any ideas?
,forbes.,2007-08-07T16:24Z,"uberben:

right click on the .dmg of zero hour and hit ""mount it""
it should now have a DVD icon on your desktop.
drag that into toast and burn it.
it seemed to work for me just now."

,uberben,2007-08-08T20:50Z,"Zero Hour still not working, Disk Utility can't verify it without errors and Toast nor the mac can't mount it without errors.

,forest hunter,2007-08-10T10:47Z,"If your on a intel mac you must update to the latest version which upgrades the game to run natively on intel........problem is when you do this it asks for a serial.......

,rberg79,2008-02-26T03:01Z,"Toast is a mac application that, among several other things, can mount disk images. That means that the application takes a disk image (for example, commandandconquer.dmg or GTASanAndreas.iso) and puts the contents on a virtual drive. MEANING it makes the stuff in the disk image file LOOK like it's actually on a dvd-rom in your physical drive.

You know, I wish I could tell the world that they should google their questions before they ask them... wink, wink.

Florgators, you might need to do port forwarding? google it."

,Xelo2000,2008-08-07T17:30Z,"nevermind, figured it out. zero hour wont update to universal binary by default when you run the update, you have to do it manually.

Follow this:
For Zero Hour update follow these steps: 1. Download this update 2. Run it. It will only update Command & Conquer Generals but not Zero Hour 3. Download Pacifist (www.charlessoft.com) 4. Get the file EN_CCG1.0.4_ZH1.0.2_Installer.pkg inside the CC Patch and open it with Pacifist. 5. Extract the file Zero Hour.app into the Zero Hour directory Now you have an universal binary which you can run on Intel Mac's"
,torgy-17,2008-08-13T10:19Z,I can't extract Zero Hour.app : / any ideas why?
,shredtheibanez,2008-08-25T12:23Z,"Downloaded, Worked Brilliant.


Open generals, Copy data to apps, Update generals.
Open Zero Hour, copy Data to apps, Update zero hour ( Which also updates generals )

To run:

Generals can be mounted via os x, But zero hour requires toast, im using toast 9. Mount Either image through toast and then hit the app in your apps folder.

The NO-CD cracks dont seems to work for me, however just mounting the install images worked a treat.

Mac OS X 10.4.11 ( Tiger )

Enjoy, I will Seed for Atleast 100%.

2. Download NoCD torrent mentioned by dexter090

5. Now install the zero hour folder.
