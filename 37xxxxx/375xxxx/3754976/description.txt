This is BustaÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s first new album in four years plus Dr. Dre cosigns by signing him to Aftermath. Will the success enjoyed by 50 Cent, Eminem and The Game work for Busta? Surprisingly, Busta has never sounded so mature -- joining a brigade of over 30 rappers who are thinking beyond the corner. Songs like \"In the Ghetto,\" \"Been Through the Storm\" and \"You CanÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t Hold a Torch\" reflect a more grown-man outlook, which is a refreshing departure. There are the requisite fast-chatter club tracks, some predictably formulaic (\"Touch It\"), some better than expected (\"I Love My Bitch\"), some that will leave you scratching your head (\"IÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ll Do It All,\" featuring Latoya Jackson). Unfortunately, the album is also overloaded with more guests than needed --Stevie Wonder and Q-Tip were good, while Rick James middling and Swizz Beatz should stick to producing. ItÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s hard to tell what expectations to put on this album. ItÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s not going to trump 50 Cent sales but itÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s also a better effort than Busta has put forth on his last few, and thatÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s worth letting it bang. --Oliver Wang
