,Hetfield_J,2007-07-23T22:43Z,Thanks man! I was in Stockholm and that was great!
,master_of_metal,2007-07-24T07:47Z,"Thanks man, are you the filmer of this show?"
,Surmapuro,2007-07-24T23:25Z,"Nope. I'm not the one who shot this video.
it was my cousin with her ""steady hands"".
I just edited it to one clip.
Those bastards took my camera at the security
check (of course I got it back after the gig).

,kirvesmies,2007-08-05T16:36Z,1.1gt and video is 18 min long? Eh.. Miksi ei yhtään kokonaista biisiä?
,Mr_Zos,2007-08-05T17:19Z,1.1 g and 18 min means GOOD quality:)
,kirvesmies,2007-08-05T23:52Z,This not so good quality..  But thx
,Boozehound_,2007-08-06T01:27Z,"The quality is really good, considering that it´s been shot by a random-viewer, not by an pro. Plus this is waaaaay better than nothing, and like I said, shot by a viewer so I think it´s kinda idiotic to ask why there are no full songs. Thx Surmapuro."
