,flowzero,2007-12-06T15:46Z,anyone got this working?
,RipMaster,2008-03-26T19:06Z,"The was i see this working, is, you install chessmaster, but you have to update it to 1.0.1 BEFORE you can use the patch, as i see the NO CD patch works for the 1.0.1 version.  Only problem is, there is no registration number to get the update to work.  :("
,RipMaster,2008-03-26T19:07Z,"Sorry, type-o........They WAY i see this working......i should really proof read..lol"

,lastmile77,2008-07-06T05:16Z,"I can't get the patch to work (Intel iMac 10.5) on 1.0 or after the 1.0.1 update.  I mounted the toast image file, installed, and then tried to apply the 1.0 patch.  It says some files won't be patched.  You can skip those files (actually 1 file) and continue the patch but it doesn't work.  The error log shows that the program file itself was skipped.  Updated to 1.0.1 and tried that patch, same problem.  Any help? Even if I buy this game I'm going to want to do the patch.  DVD required...what is this 1998?"
,lastmile77,2008-07-06T05:18Z,"Also tried burning the toast image to DVD, thinking that it would be seen as the original DVD an allow me to play.  No luck.  It doesn't even show up on my desktop though it burned fine in Toast.  It could still be a burning problem with something I did though."
,lastmile77,2008-07-06T05:32Z,Retried burning and it worked.  Still can't patch!
,ahso,2008-07-12T09:25Z,"I can verify that this does work. But you need to ignore one .sit file called ""Chessmaster 9000 1.0 NoCD [k].sitx"". This is for 1.0 only, and you will be patching the updated 1.0.1 (which includes all previous patches including the NoCD patch).

So, do the following:

1. Remove the ""Chessmaster 9000 1.0 NoCD [k].sitx"" file to avoid confusion.
2. Open the .toast and install Chessmaster 9000
3. Open ""CM9K-1.0.1-Update.sit"" and launch the extracted app ""Chessmaster 9000 Update""
4. Open ""Chessmaster 9000 1.0.1 [k].zip"" and launch the extracted app ""Chessmaster 9000 1.0.1 [k]""
5. Thank the uploader & enjoy

,downloadman911,2008-07-29T22:12Z,does not work
,neojorge,2008-08-02T01:45Z,"Doesn't work, waste of time, waste of gb, waste of bandwith."
,fkerr,2008-08-24T23:52Z,"DONT WASTE TIME ON THIS!

DOESN'T WORK!"
,ahso,2008-09-10T07:07Z,"One qualification: the software does work, but only on 10.4.11 according to the instructions previously described. I recently tried installing on 10.5.4 and it gives the errors other's have mentioned when trying to patch the 1.0.1 update (some files could not be patched). But it still works on 10.5.4 if you burn to a DVD and insert the DVD when asked. "
,guilherme_rache,2008-11-13T02:19Z,"DOESN'T WORK !!!

The instructions above don't work !!!

DON'T WAST TIME ON THIS !!"
,D_O_M_O_N_A_T_O_R,2010-02-24T06:42Z,Hmmm Chess Sounds Fun Not!
,septimus_severius,2010-03-19T20:48Z,"Yeah ! I managed to make it work on my PowerPC G5 (OS 10.5.6).
Here is how :
1-burn the dvd
2-install the game
***The updates made everything crash. I just ignored them***
At this point the game was working fine but...
since there was some really annoying bugs (my ranking was over 20 millions and I could'nt compete against anything else then chessmaster itself) I managed to find a working patch here:

http://support.feralinteractive.com/?mod_id=patches&gamename=chessmaster9k&file=cm9k1.1
The latest one worked wonderfully.

On my computer the game automatically installed in french. It might be because my computer's settings are french. The patch on the link above has both english and french versions, wich I believe was the problem with the included patches. 

I also had troubles starting the game because it could'nt find ""Chessmaster 9000 Manual.pdf"". This again could be caused by the fact that my computer's settings are french. The manual is on the ""english"" folder on the DVD but is named ""Manual.pdf"". Change the name to ""Chessmaster 9000 Manual.pdf"" and drag it to the ""Data"" folder in your chessmaster 9000 folder. You still have the french version : ""Chessmaster 9000 Manuel.pdf"" that could'nt be recognized by the program in the ""Data"" folder.

Thanks luddelump."
,DigitalSelf,2010-05-02T19:42Z,The no cd cracks don't work but the game runs with the dvd. You just can't burn the dvd with the image mounted and it will surely run.
,pawnoir,2011-01-25T11:22Z,"It perfectly works:
- Open the .toast and install Chessmaster 9000
- Open ""Chessmaster 9000 1.0.1[k].zip"" and select on your hard drive the application ""Chessmaster 9000""
That is to say : don't update
(Everything's ok : 2D, 3D, Libraryâ&#x20AC;Ś and it has been installed automatically in my own language)
Mac OS X 10.4.11 (Intel)"
