Thx."
,drBronco,2008-04-13T15:09Z,Thanks alot!
,teenagefreedomfighter,2008-05-23T02:53Z,"Hate to be a hooker with a penis but this album SUCKS. If your an old Tool fan this is not for you. Don't believe me? Check it out for yourself.

P.s. If you didn't the the joke in the first line and claim to be a Tool fan, rent a gun and buy a bullet."
,Zerojohnnyx,2008-06-28T05:05Z,"teenagefreedomfighter , if that was a joke it wasn't funny. If you really are an old school Tool fan then you would remain one instead of putting your opinion where no one asked!"
,zolithegame,2008-07-15T19:30Z,kibaszott jo album!!!!kössz!thanx!!!
,TBiRD8080,2008-09-11T08:07Z,"I have yet to listen to this album but no matter what TOOL puts out I will listen to. However, any true TOOL fan will like what they put out instead of insulting one of the most prolific bands of our time."
,Shinners,2008-10-26T04:01Z,Thanks victoreta and the seeders that have kept this live..
,Shinners,2008-10-26T04:14Z,"btw - have to disagree with teenagefreedomfighter (considering your moniker I've sure you won't mind the right to reply)

I've downloaded this tonight because I neglected to keep my Tool collection nearby (silly me) and I needed to listen to some of their best... I can't claim to be an OGT (!) but if you really believe this albums sucks then you seriously need to start your own band. 

Maybe call it Tool-less?

You look lovely in that dress btw.

>> I've got synchronized, full version
>> of `10,000 days` track.
>> It's just amazing.

Sadly, I dunno how to put it here.

If someone could tell me
I would be happy to do it...

If you don't know this version,
you won't be dissapointed."
,michalg,2008-11-09T14:22Z,"All right. Here it is:

,thesaxon,2010-04-13T21:21Z,"@ Teenage Freedom

The only thing that sucks here is you on my dick! You suck, slurp and sip my dick! You know that big thick vein I got on top of my dick? I want you to run your tongue up and down it and get it nice and plump so I can blow my wad down your slutty throat. 

This is the greatest rock album in all of musical history bar-fucking-none! Of any era or genre! Vicarious is by far the greatest lyrical and musical composition ever recorded. There is nothing like it in time past nor will there ever be in the future. Floyd, Zep, Doors, G&R, Megadeth, Slayer, Pantera,  etc, etc...No one on any level can touch this album or that song. To have another super nova song in Jambi on the same album as Vicarious is simply too good to be true but actually is! They could have stuck Jambi in the middle of a cover of absolute shit and I would be all over it. With this album, Tool did for lyrics, what Mozart did for orchestra.  The rhythm, flow, beat and climax of Vicarious is a journey of intellect of the grandest sort. It is lyrically and musically orgasmic. Never have I ever played a song more than Vicarious. It is already going on 10 times a week since this album came out. Sometimes I listen to it 4 to 5 hours straight a day while I work. If that nigger dog shit called rap wasn't given the attention it doesn't deserve, this album would have received much more recognition. In time, it will be recognized for what it really is: The greatest album of all time. I am proud to say I saw them live on this one 7 times in 4 states.

cool story bro"
,Infares,2011-04-12T00:13Z,"Bands grow and change over time.  If TOOL's work after Ã†nima continued to sound just like their earlier shit, they'd just be another Aerosmith, covering themselves for decades instead of growing and creating.

Ergo, fuck off, teenagefreedomfighter.  If you are a teenager you can't claim to be an 'old school' tool fan anyways, you were barely even shitting on your own when their first three albums were out."
,pierced_vixen,2011-05-06T22:43Z,thanx tool rocks!!!
,mjb1784,2011-06-27T04:38Z,"To the guy who said this album sucks... GO watch the 10,000 days tour, and listen to Wings for Marie during a thunderstorm. Till then FUCK YOU BUDDY AND BUY MY RECORD"
,jackson5more,2011-10-30T05:47Z,"Maynard - is that you? ?>?
Top music for the awakening masses, not so much for the restless sleepers. Thanks to all for keeping this alive ~"
