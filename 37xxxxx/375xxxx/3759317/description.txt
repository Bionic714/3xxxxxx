Fire House Dog
Rex, Hollywood's top K-9 star, gets lost and is reluctantly adopted by a young boy.

His father, fire chief of a rundown station agrees to the adoption only if his defiant son takes care of the K-9. Little do they realize Rexx will not only bring them closer but also bring some much-needed faith back to the fire station.
