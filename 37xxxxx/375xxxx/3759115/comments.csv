I have a problem.I downloaded awakening prologue and awakening level. Now I want to play these files in my mp3 player.But, You see, my mp3 player does not play wav format and it supports mp3,wma and other format. Does any one please give me a suggestion as to how to convert wav(or flac) format files to wma lossless without any loss in quality? I mean, awakening prologue has 1411 kb/sec.Is it possible to convert this file to wma with that same bitrate? Is there any software to do that conversion? Please post a reply tho this message.  Thank you and happy downloading!!!"

 Can  anyone upload holosync support letters here? I have been searching this in the net for so long and I couldn't find it. If anyone have any sort of links to support letters, please post them or upload them. I asking this because I don't know how to use these sound tracks. Support letters provide suggestions on how to use these soundtracks."
