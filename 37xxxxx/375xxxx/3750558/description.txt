Ejay Special Edition.

This is one of the easiest music making programs ever. It might be a bit old, but if you are a beginner, then this may be the best way to start your music creating career.

It's simple:

You got 3 categories to choose. Dance, rave and hiphop. Then you can go choose what kind of music you want, bass, synthy, voice, effect, etc.
Then pull the string of music you choose up on the line.

Then you can make your very own track!

I will be seeding in the start, but still please seed.

Oh, and write a little "Thank you!" :D

Nothing more to say? Oh, yes! Enjoy! :)
