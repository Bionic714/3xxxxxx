,prol-1,2007-07-29T11:09Z,"I definitely plan on uploading those final books when they arrive, it'll be bittersweet."
,W00DR0W,2007-07-31T08:57Z,"Thanks a lot for sharing.

Can't wait to see what happens."
,ShadedSpriter,2007-08-03T13:33Z,I heard about the film deal and was just looking for the comics...when is it due to finish? (just checked the vertigo site...it says #60)
,prol-1,2007-08-04T20:48Z,"Well, I don't know if the info on Shia LaBeouf is correct anymore because word has it Vaughn has asked the Toffer Greyson(sp?) play the main part."
,Short2Cents,2007-08-07T07:34Z,"I dont know if anyone else is having this problem, but issue #35 wont open for some odd reason...everything else is amazing"
,Short2Cents,2007-08-07T08:56Z,"btw, im using ComicRack....it didnt read issue 35 but using winrar i just extracted the image files and it worked fine"
,prol-1,2007-08-15T09:19Z,All of these work when using CDisplay. I've never tried ComicRack
,TriangleMan,2007-12-28T08:57Z,"i am quite awesomely happy this torrent exists. plz seed more! i love u guys! im at issue 15. luckily that's the end of a volume, so im not caught in the middle of something waiting for the torrent to finish."
,Stuppski,2008-01-28T00:02Z,"Hey, I downloaded it and I can see all the issues. However, I cannot open them. What program do I open them with? Word, Adobe, ECR aren't working."
,rummybottle,2008-03-13T11:02Z,"Based on the byte-size, issue #14 in this torrent is a broken version with a non-working page 14 (""Y_-_The_Last_Man_14_p13"")."
,darkpoet1978,2008-10-05T08:54Z,I own the paperback sets of this (Books 1-10) and it is the best comic series I have ever read.  If you enjoy Y: The Last Man go out and buy it.  Digital comics are great but nothing compares to holding it in your hands!
