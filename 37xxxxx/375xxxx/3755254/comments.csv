,neslesman,2007-07-28T01:06Z,thank you spider.  This gives us the most up to date version for FS2004 as well.  I'd love to get the similarly updated Piper Warrior from Aussim.
,spiders96,2007-07-28T01:34Z,"I'm also looking for the Piper Warrior.  If I find it, I will be sure to post it here."
,neslesman,2007-07-28T02:07Z,"I've got the Warrior but it's only version 1.0 and it's got  some little gauge buggies.  Can't remember but it's probably a RIP.  The 1.0 means it didn't even get the most rudimentary fixes.
If nothing else shows up over a few days I'll post the 1.0.

Thanks again for the UPDATED Glasair, it's a really cool airplane and doesn't get the attention it deserves."
,supercar1000,2007-07-28T21:47Z,"This is the FS9 version... No bloom, self shadow or els... the mdl file is named: asg3_fs9.mdl"

,FlightSimerr,2007-12-01T19:12Z,Yeah i have a problem where When I first get in the Virtual Cockpit I can see clearly out the glass but after about 4 seconds the window shades to a light blue and I no longer can see through the windsheild. Any ideas? It's the only plane that i encounter that problem on. Also i have acceleration and i know that caused a lot of problems with certain aircraft so that may be it.
,FlightSimerr,2007-12-01T22:28Z,"If you Install this plane after installing FSX Acceleration and SP1/SP2 then you'll need to edit one of the texture files. Here's the Link to how to fix it on the aussi sim forum.

Just replace the X's with the appropriate Letters. Then when you get to the page scroll to the bottom. The last post tells you how to fix it!. 

Thanks for the UP!"
,shrant,2008-01-07T11:25Z,I have a question? Don't you download this plane through LimeWire or else there is another software through which we can download? Please answer thank you
,unknownas,2008-02-29T00:29Z,"Thanks,but there no Aircraft Control Panel, I really need it! I have no ideas where to find it! HELP!"
,titio,2011-08-22T00:17Z,I am not be abble to fix the problem with blank texture. The link from FlightSimer is broken. Please can you send the fix to Piratebay?
