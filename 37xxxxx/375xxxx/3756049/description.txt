Rewind to 1987 America. President Ronald Reagan was embroiled in the Iran-Contra scandal, the stock market experienced its second largest crash ever, Three Men and a Baby was stinking up the screens and Michael Jackson showed that he was truly Bad.

Back before the term "alternative rock" was co-opted in the 90s to describe fairly generic music, in the mid to late-80s it was used for music, often creative and unusual, that was ignored by the mainstream radio and press, particularly Rolling Stone magazine. Independent labels like SST, Twin/Tone, Homestead, Dischord and Touch & Go sprung out of record stores and from artists who wanted to create their own sound from the bottom up.

Similar movements were happening in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and especially England, but this series is dedicated to the Americans, who tried to create something lasting and sometimes succeeded. Some were influential, some became legendary and some just disappeared.
