Good dvdrip, tho the movie is split in 2 files. It would have been way better to have a higher Resolution and a lower Video Bit Rate. Anyways good work, ty!

  Resolution = 688x288
  Bit Rate = 1734kbps (file 1), 1678kbps (file 2)
  Frame Rate = 23.976
  Compression = XVID
  Duration = 53:53 (file 1), 53:53 (file 2)

  Bit Rate = 128kbps
  Channels = 2
