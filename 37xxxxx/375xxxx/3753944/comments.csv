,donpedro,2007-07-27T14:11Z,"The horror movie of the 90's! It's a hybrid between Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure and Terror on Elm Street. Surreal, lots of gore and funny."

,Abisha,2008-01-20T16:14Z,"this ROCKS
i have been searching for this a long time
even will buy the DVD if it existed"
,storm-83,2008-04-13T22:05Z,"heard some rumors a while back that supposedly someone was planning to release this movie on the dvd format, but suddenly all talk ceased and i have never since heard anything to confirm og deny any of this...!!! but i guess that this is one of those flicks that is so underground that no one really knows to what extend it is watched / worshipped...

btw. how is the quality? mind you, of course i'm downloading no matter what..."
,storm-83,2008-04-14T16:36Z,"wow, since this has not yet been released to dvd i was worried about an awful quality due to copying a vhs tape, but this is not the case. If Brisco County Jr. was half this quality it would be amazing...!!!

everything considered 10/10
must have for everyone loving this flick"
