,dex-star,2009-06-15T01:56Z,"^I like the Sentry too, but for some reason he receives a lot of hate :/"
,shahane,2010-05-06T20:40Z,"In ""The Sentry & X-Men"" page 9 seems to be missing.  Was this an ad you removed?  The original file I DLed of it had that page as broken in the archive.

I just want to know if I'm missing story or not.

Thanks a bunch for putting this together!"
,NinpoLore,2011-09-07T03:40Z,"Even though I hate Robert Reynolds guts, I've been looking for the Sentry arc for some time - much obliged! Great scans, and your clean-up efforts are appreciated.

And since I see someone down there wondering why Sentry is so hated, I can only speak for myself - he's always seemed more of a plot device than an actual hero or character to me. The whole duality thing between the Sentry and Void personalities allows him to act as both hero and villain depending on a particular writer's narrative needs. Beyond that, he's just too damn powerful, which is kind of the reason I've always hated Superman. Weakness breeds triumph and growth, and while you could argue that the Void personality is a form of weakness, it just doesn't cut it for me. 

Plus he was a junkie! He got his powers because he was looking to get high! In any case, thanks again. Make mine Marvel. :D"
