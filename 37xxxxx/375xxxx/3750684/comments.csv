Have you ever used encrypted zip archives? Perhaps you received such kind of files with important data from your business partner by e-mail or may be you keep data in encrypted zip archives to prevent an illegal access.

If so, then you happened probably to forget or to be incapable to find a password to one of these zip files. It becomes a more trouble if you need files stored in the archive immediately."
