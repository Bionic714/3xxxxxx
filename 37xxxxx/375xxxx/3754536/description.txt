WOW HD: Provides enhanced width, bass and definition for music sources.

Headphone 360: Enhances both stereo and multichannel sources for headphone listening.

TruSurround XT: Virtualizes multichannel content for listening on two speakers,
    with post-processing enhancements.

CircleSurround II: Decodes ANY stereo input into 5.1 surround sound.
