,tomtomx,2007-08-06T13:05Z,Extremely skillfully made piece of propaganda from an arab point of view. It almost makes you belive the message. Until you start to think of all the facts the filmmaker deliberately leaves out... Or distorts... (As always with propaganda. ) Nevertheless it illuminates the horrible living conditions the ordinary palestinian arabs have to endure as a consequence  to their corrupt leaders greed and long tactics of random attacks on civilian israelis. Hopefully this will all soon be history.
[T],Roys,2007-08-08T14:47Z,"We have just seen on TV how the israeli authorities have had to carry away fundamentalists from illegal ""settlements"". It's very saddening to see these wildly kicking jewish fundamentalists behaving in such a unacceptable and unmature way hurting the palestinians at whom they through stones and misbehave in all ways, the israeli government which have to be ashamed in the whole world and lastly to themselves when they throw petrol on a fire instead of trying to live in harmony with neighbors"
,cyberpunkx,2007-08-13T03:41Z,It is nice to see the Zionists' comments. Please tell us what facts they distorted or omitted.

[T],Roys,2007-08-17T15:29Z,"May Tomtom should read in:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazar

to see where these hords of ""returning jews"" should go. The majority of the jews today stem from that origin - a turkish-tribe north of Black Sea. Just study history unbiased. A turkish tribe is granted guaranteed citizenship in a place where their forefathers has never been because of a religious believe they have... Who may complain about the Mullahs in Teheran after that?

It is right that there has been jews living in Palestine for 3000 years or more - but how many??? There has been ""jews"" living in many places on earth. In Istambul there has been a jewish community for maybe 2000 years. But no jews claim the right to half of Turkey and the consequent expelling of the turks from Turkey  because of that...

The film is among other things about the mistreating of the palestinian people by immigrating jews.. That is something that should be stated. Do not try to strangle information for a complete picture of the events."
,tomtomx,2007-08-17T19:08Z,"Maybe you should read that link yourself since it debunks the exact myth you promote: 
Read all of it. Or at least:
""Recent DNA studies on the Y-Chromosome of Ashkenazi Jews showed they had an ""extremely close affinity [with] non-Jewish Middle Eastern populations"", indicating ""a common Middle Eastern origin"",[31] as does the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of at least 40% of the current Ashkenazi population.[32] So although Khazars might have been absorbed into the Jewish population it is unlikely that they formed a large percentage of the ancestors of modern Ashkenazim.[33]"""

[T],Roys,2007-08-18T00:15Z,"Dear Tomtomx:

You seems already completely enlighed : else your reading in the abovementioned article would soon lead you to links to www.ajhg.org where ""Behar et al""... supports this idea of a Khazar heritage.. maybe even leading the majority of jewish decendants genetic jewish relation to as few as maybe even 4 women...

But as you already are fully enlighted its futile to ask you to read more... maybe someone else have interests in anything else than fairy tales..."
,tomtomx,2007-08-18T01:13Z,"Where did you learn to read? Your article, just like all other genetic studies, draws the conclusion that the now living ashkenazi jews have hebrew roots: 

"" ...a detailed phylogenetic tree for the major Ashkenazi Hgs K and N1b, allowing the detection of a small set of only four individual female ancestors, likely from a Hebrew/Levantine mtDNA pool, whose descendants lived in Europe and carried forward their particular mtDNA variants... """
,tomtomx,2007-08-18T01:15Z,There might be many arguements against Israel. But the Khazar nonsense sure as hell isn't one of them.
[T],Roys,2007-08-18T11:21Z,"What it shows is that they have (at least) 1 ancestor probably of ""likely from a Hebrew/Levantine mtDNA pool"".

In 2000 years there is approximately 80-100 generations. They have ""at least one such ancestor"" among 2 in power 100 ancestors (thats a number with around 30 digits), thats a pretty big number of ancestors. They do not have that level of rightful claim for historylinks with present day Israel as they claim. (Just look at the redhaired jews more looking like scotsmen than any arabs)...

Also most probably they have much higher heritage than just 4 women but 4 jews from the destroyed Jerusalem year 70 after Christ just doesn't justify any claim from 20 million people for ownership of all of Palestine. As you may know UN discussed even giving Madagascar or parts around Uruguay to the Jews after the second worldwar. The jews should have behaved to the population already living there with some respect in case UN had given them land there to live in.

I don't object to the existens of Israel. I just object against the israelis treatment of the population that already lived there for many hundreds/thousands of years before the ""invasion of the turks"". The hebrew language they learned AFTER comming there. They are plainly russian, german, spanish, arab immigrants with a specific religion in common.

You write that it may be many arguments against Israel. Name a few?"
[T],Roys,2007-08-18T17:40Z,"Tomtom...

I found another telling movie... Check this out:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3771026/Battle_for_the_Holy_Land__Love_Thy_Neighbour

It described precisely this treatment that I talk about"
,tomtomx,2007-08-18T22:35Z,"How do you explain all the ashkenazi jews that lived all over europe long before the khazar royals converted? Did their families vanish? 
Secondly jews have been speaking and praying in hebrew for thousands of years. As for the genetics. Nobody claimed that the 4 women lived 70 ad. Since the first ""documented"" jews were Abraham and his family (about 4000 years earlier), it's not so strange after all. And the genetic study only concern the ashkenazi jews. Not the sefardic. 
I didn't object to the fact that the palestinian arabs live a terrible life. Of course they do. And it's a shame to say the least. I objected to the khazar nonsense and the idea that it is all the jews fault. The palestinian arabs have a huge part in the guilt through their leaders. It's not like it's a peaceful people of small defensless infantile children. For instance things got much worse after the last intifada. Negotiations stranded, violence multiplied etc.
As for the captivity af the palestinian arabs. People tend to forget that the west bank has borders towards Jordania and Gaza towards Egypt. Thos are also closed adding to the palestinian arabs sufferings.
Things are always more complicated than they seem. ""But of course it's more conveniant to just blame the jews..."""
[T],Roys,2007-08-18T23:28Z,"Tomtom

""all the ashkenazi jews"" .. they weren't that many.. Some were expelled from Spain by  Ferdinand II 1492, of whom some went to Poland. Some were converted Khazars and yet some were probably from the area of present day Israel. Many mixed with local populations. Thats why jews have very differentiated looks. eg Falasha are black jews from Ethiopia. All these different people have one thing in common, namely their religion and belief, common culture and traditions. On that base they are welcomed and automatically given israeli citizenship whereas the population that have lived in the area for hundreds and thousands of years is denied israeli citizenship. There is witness in the movie about how the different groups helped eachother like good neighbors before. Most of that seems to have gone. Left is bulldozers, machineguns, settlements, a huge concrete wall digging deep into non-israeli territory and some suicidebombers.

The film is showing how this old population is kicked out of their homes and mistreated by the alleged democratic israeli state on the pretext that ""some are terrorists"". With such treatment you would become a terrorist yourself. As a lawabiding person you would not like to be pushed around just because you were a ""palestinian"".

By the way, palestinians are not ""Arabs"" - they are a semitic tribe too - like the original jews. So one could say that the israeli government is behaving anti-semitic when they treat palestinians bad.

Let us hope that the Scientologists don't hit the idea that they have been promised the state of New York by God or L. Ron Hubbard and wants to ""return"" to the promised land...

I guess that you have by now seen the movies and all the material therein. Now, what facts have been distorted and what other arguments may be put against Israel as you wrote earlier?"
,tomtomx,2007-08-18T23:51Z,"Alreday answered that with the link above. It would take to mĂşch space to write it all here. 
You still go about that khazar nonsense despite all that is written on the pages you yourself linked to!!!? Unbelievable."
,tomtomx,2007-08-19T00:04Z,"And of course palestinians are arabs. That what was they called themselves until Arafat some decades ago made the tactic call to change their name to ""philistines"" after the small probably greek colony of sea farers that under a short period lived in an area aproximately where gaza is today back in biblical times. 
(Tha palestinian arabs have nothing in common with the Philistees. Except for the name thay ""borrowed"".)
Under the British mandate the population was defined by the british as jewish palestinians and arab palestinians. 
The word Palestine was adopted by the romans to insult the israelites by naming the country after one of it's former enemies.
This doesn't contradict with them being a semitic people since all arabs are considered semitic. 
Yes I also read that quote of jews being antisemitic hundreds of times on all the webs neo-nazi sites, Just next to the khazar nonsense."
[T],Roys,2007-08-19T00:08Z,"If you are lazy I don't understand why you bother to comment here at all. As soon as something else than giving links and cutting and pasting is required from you you just leave walkover?

You try to make this movie a jewish-muslim question - it is not! It is ""the state of Israel"" - civilian palestinian. Honorable israeli citizens dislike the actions of the israeli state as much as any other decent person. Some brave israelis even choose to go to jail rather than participate in the atrocities. This is explained in the movie - Did you even bother to watch it?

You have not answered what other arguments may be put against Israel. You wrote that many arguments could be put against Israel earlier?!?!?!

- Watch the movie and think self
- palestinians are NOT ""arabs"""
,tomtomx,2007-08-19T00:21Z,"""whereas the population that have lived in the area for hundreds and thousands of years is denied israeli citizenship""

About 20-25% of israeli citizens are arabs. With democratic rights and representation in parliament. (Actually Israel is the only place in the middle east where arabs have full democratic rights. Not to mention the safest place to live if you happen to be a christian arab... )

The west bank is an temporary occupied territory. Not Israel. (No, I don't support the occupation!) "
,tomtomx,2007-08-19T00:25Z,"Yes I watched the movie before I wrote my first comment. 
And are you to lazy to read the links?
As for the copy/pasting. You seen to do that a lot yourself. All of your argumentation is found on numerous neo-nazi sites all over the web.
And if you bothered to read I wrote: 
""There MIGHT be many arguments against Israel. But the Khazar nonsense sure as hell isn't one of them.""
"
,tomtomx,2007-08-19T00:52Z,"To clarify (again!):
I don't defend the way the palestinian arabs are treated. 
I don't approve of the israeli occupation.
I don't think that the problem is as easy as to give israel the full blame. 
Especially considering for instance the close ties between the grand mufti of jerusalem (and his muslim SS division) and the german nazis before israel was even founded.
And I hope that there will soon be peace in the region, so the palestinian arabs finally could live descent lives and the israelis could stop sheltering against rocket fire.
And I still object to the khazar nonsense. (As do all of the worlds objective academic historians). The only ones that promote that nonsense are arabs and neo nazis. (And the useful idiots they manage to delude.)"
[T],Roys,2007-08-19T00:58Z,"No copy/pasting at all has been made by me. and i don't make MY arguments by sending you to some obscure think-tank-site. Do you really mean that I am pasting from some Nazi-site?????? SHAME ON YOU!!!
You seem to swallow all that Israel is doing.. torture-murder-mistreating-annecting territories to a degree so you make me wonder if you are employed by some israeli authority or if you else see your role in automatically defending a disgusting behaviour from the state of Israel.

The persons interviewed in the movie are mostly israeli intellectuals - maybe you want to call them traitors?

Im not too lazy to read links - how do you want me to reply to what is written in them? Go to your friends and boost that you held against an army of people with other views than you but spare me this trick of trying to let me argue agains a myriad of web-pages.
"
[T],Roys,2007-08-19T00:59Z,"Arabs are people living in arabia - the arabic peninsula. Palestinians are people living in or originating from the former brittish mandate Palestine (In my view some jews classify as palestinians :-) ) Some, maybe as you say 20-25% of the israeli citizens are palestinians (not arabs). They would have been many more if they hadn't been driven away and shuffled together into refugee camps here and there. Many palestinians took refuge in Jordania.
""Arab"" is not a synonym of ""Muslim""
""Arab"" is not a synonym of everyone living in the middleast and not beeing jewish or christian.
How many percent of the israeli citizens are russian and french and german and jewish arabs?
I though 100% of the israelis were israelis not arabs or russian or german. One thing is what they are another where they were born and please don't interchange ""arabs"" with ""palestinians"" - The westbank is not Arabia. You tend to use the word ""arabs"" in a condescending manner."

[T],Roys,2007-08-19T01:27Z,"I do read your responses and partly it seems as if you should agree with what's in the movie .. but in the end you refuse to admit that the movie gives any credible picture at all of the state in the west-bank calling it ""Extremely skillfully made piece of propaganda from an arab point of view"" (this time i cut and pasted!)

As for the definition go to wikipedia and make a search for ""arab"". That arab peninsula definition you wrote sure would upset many arabs deprived of their identity.
And when did I use the word arab in a condescending manner!!!?
I also never wrote that I approved of neither the treatment of palestinian arabs or the occupation as such. I wrote the opposite.
I also wrote that... Oh, never mind. This is leading nowhere... Read my earlier comments. It's all there..."
[T],Roys,2007-08-19T02:09Z,"If there are palestinian ""arabs"" then there must be some other kind of palestinian that needs differentiating from. What are that other kind of palestinian?

You wrote that 20-25% of the israeli citizens are arab. Are the rest non-arabs?

The jews that migrated from Arabia are they not arabs? Do there exist jewish arabs? Would you use an expression like ""libanese arabs""? ""Egyptian arabs""?

Would you call israelis palestinian? At least the israelis that lived in Palestine before 1948 were all palestinians. When did they seize to be palestinians? Those who didn't seize to be palestinians how did they suddenly become arabs? Yassir Arafat who probably was born i Kairo, was he an ""arab""?

THE MOVIE is mostly about the treatment of nonjewish population in former Palestine and present westbank. It is an historic description of events. It is very much needed. It is not propaganda."
,tomtomx,2007-08-19T02:55Z,"I already answered all of that except for the jewish arab-thing. 
Yes, there are jewish arabs. That's what some of them call themselves. They're also called Mizrahim - Jews that fled or were thrown out of arab countries after 1948. About a million of them.
But that's not what this movie is about. This movie is about the suffering and terrible living conditions of the arab palestinians living in the occupied territories. Conditions that got far worse after the palestinian arab leaders started the second intifada. Which caused israel to strengthen it's defense to a ruthless level. This film describes the terrible living conditions of the innocent palestinian arabs caught in between the israelis and the Palestinian authorities and militants. It chooses to leave out those parts of the background that stems from the palestinian arab leaders. (Like for instance funding of terrorism, heavy rocket shooting etc etc.) It also choses to leave out the corruption of the palestinian arab leadership and administration, where millions after millions end up in swiss bank accounts instead of in schools, hospitals and hungry stomaches.
The goal of this film is to put ALL of the blame on the israelis. That is an extremely simplified message. As such it is propaganda."
[T],Roys,2007-08-19T15:46Z,"If you want other things shown than what's in THIS movie ... you are fully free to give us links to such movies.. But you don't decide what should be in THIS movie..

You say that THIS movie put all blame on the israelis... and you have not been able in our discussion to point to ONE SINGLE argument that ""MIGHT"" be put against Israel - thats why you are not trustworthy in your critisism of THIS movie.

You say that you don't approve of the israeli occupation... Why not? What is wrong with the occupation? What are you doing for it to end? You certainly seems energetic enough to help in the matter.

Remember that the palestinians in the diaspora ALSO wants to return to their homes that they just recently got kicked out from. No 2 or 3 thousand years there..."
,tomtomx,2007-08-19T22:01Z,"Amazing how much you can write without being able to read. I wrote several times that I am against both the occupation and the way the palestinian arabs are treated. That is a clear critique of israels behaviour.
I however don't share hamas opinion that israel doesn't exist and that all jews there should be thrown out or killed. And I don't think it's ok for 1000's of hamas funded rockets to be fired on civilians in israel. (Giving israel a reason to tighten the grip. )
Somehow hamas views seem to affect the peace process. And unfortunately a majority of the palestinian arabs outside of israel voted for them...
This of course isn't mentioned in this propaganda film, since. That would make things to complex for the useful idiots it was produced for"
[T],Roys,2007-08-19T22:20Z,"You never end do you???

Arnold Schwartzenegger did not participate in the film nor was japanese foreign affair discussed.. A lot wasn't included - or was omitted from the film. No mentioning of the landing on the moon or small green men on Mars... Ofcourse it was Hamas propaganda while you could not comment, in person, directly in the movie.. Ofcourse should the israeli censorship have got the opportunity to approve the movie before it was let out for seeing. Outrageous isn't it??? You may whine and weep as best as you can, it doesn't change anything!!!

It is out and it gives some more information than the official israeli story. I understand that it is very disturbing that anyone else may have their say, but we are not in Israel are we?

Being captive slaves in Egypt building the pyramids. Not to mention the Holocaust. Don't the Palestinians even get the History Channel? When's the last time someone tried to kill all the Muslims? Go to Wikipedia and see just how many Jews are left on the planet. One third of it is Christian. (1.5 - 2 billion) One third is Muslim. (another 1.5 to 2 billion) There's only about 12 million Jews left on the planet. That's less than one percent. Let them fucking have it. They even kicked Egypt's ass in three days.

Israel may do things that I may disagree with but that does not make ""the Jews"" a responsible party to that action. That would be similar to the Dutch taking responsibility for the actions within the Netherlands. It's ridiculous. Just becasue S. African Apartheid was upheld by some individuals with Dutch backgrounds does NOT mean that the Dutch individual holds those policies simply because they happen to be of that nationality.
Aside from simple logical examples the film makes VERY little mention of the policies of the Arab States toward the Palestinian people. Very few people have seen how the Palestinians had been treated in Saudi Arabia! That little secret would make quite a few Princes wince!"
