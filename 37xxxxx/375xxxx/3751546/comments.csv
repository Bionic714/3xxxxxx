Hypnobeat/Gymnastic CD 1991.

Europe after reign or a soundtrack for the decay of Western civilisation? A slow and mesmeric funeral march. Sustained choral chants, a resonating beat of a dying heart, an attempt at pushing life into arid arteries. A church bell tolls, the gates open, you pass through and there is no return. Accept it now. Embrace the sublime or wallow in the mire of ruination.

Robert H. King-M.F.T.E.Q."
