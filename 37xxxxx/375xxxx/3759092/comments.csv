First, thank you for the titles you have provided here over the years. We have the same taste. You are difficult to track down since you do not subscribe to the piratebay forums. I've had a challenge trying to PM you.

I am wondering if it would be possible for you to reseed something you uploaded several months ago, ""Bullshit"" the Documentary with Vandana Shiva.

There are currently 20 waiting of us to finish the last 8% of the file. Any help would be appreciated.

,ettin,2011-06-08T05:09Z,"This ""documentary"" is edited like an obnoxious acid techno song. They loop soundbites constantly with cheesy acid techno in the background. Its basically a preachy 50 minute music video that barely makes its point across. Really just terrible. "
