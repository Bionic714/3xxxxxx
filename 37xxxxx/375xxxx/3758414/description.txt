SYNOPSIS:	
Story based upon the fantasy/adventure novels connected to the exploits of Karl Friedrich Hieronymus, Baron von MÃ¼nchhausen, a real life 18th Century German soldier of fortune.  This film was a pet project of Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, who intended it to be Germanyâ??s answer to the USAâ??s The Wizard of Oz (1939).  In my opinion, UFA fell short of that mark, although not by much.  Color photography, sound, special effects, costumes and sets are all first-rate by the standards of the time.  Despite the Nazi connection to the production, the film is free of political content; hewing closely to the traditional MÃ¼nchhausen tales.  This film is not very well known, perhaps due to its Nazi connection, which is a shame.  It should be seen.
