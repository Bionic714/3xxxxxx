,CaptButler,2007-08-03T04:16Z,Will seed again tonight.
,jengiscan,2007-12-09T12:44Z,"ive seen this before and believe you me its unbelievable, knocks the shit out of the gilliam version!
i am amazed its up as a torrent, the standard fare being pretty brainless hollywood fodder.
Please keep seeding whoever you are.
I am on 82% and I have been downloading for
about a month!!! i will seed for one month after downloading,my hard drive aint big enough for longer.  thx to all ENJOY."
,CaptButler,2007-12-29T19:32Z,Yikes!  I'm glad you are so patient (I need to check these things more often).  Will seed again ASAP.  :)
,CaptButler,2008-01-29T20:19Z,"I am gratified by the interest that has been shown in this fairly rare film, but I also must note that the torrent has been leeched out at least three times in the relatively short time it has been on TPB.  While I don't mind coming by occasionally to help out, PLEASE think of your fellow downloaders and SEED the torrent after you reach 100%.  Thank you.  :)"
,ergot,2008-02-26T01:17Z,Tackar s책 mycket!
,gundula,2010-01-17T15:55Z,"is there anybody out here?;)
pls seed!"
,CaptButler,2010-05-21T18:13Z,"I have in recent months kept this torrent in my client for weeks at a time because it has leeched out so often. I can't keep doing this; I have other torrents to attend to. Please think of your fellow downloaders and stick around awhile to seed to them!

If all else fails, post a reseed request at SuprBay. "
