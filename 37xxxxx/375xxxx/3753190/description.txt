In the Seregenti plains, Africa's garden of majestic umbrella thorn trees harbours a unique ecosystem of bush babies, chameleons, cocktail ants, and other wild wonders.

Africa?s umbrella thorn tree is armed and dangerous. It provides shelter for Countless animals that take refuge amongst its sharp needles, and rich nutrients for those tough enough to withstand its thorny claws.

The African thorn tree woodland is home to an astonishing diversity of wildlife. Against their enemies, the trees have evolved their own defences. For their allies, they have rewards. As the most successful tree to have invaded the bush country, the acacia plays a key role in an enchanting web of life...
