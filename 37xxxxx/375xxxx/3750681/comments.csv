It allows network administrators to monitor network shares and identify shares which are violating data access policy in their organization. NetShareWatcher is very handy. You can configure it once and forget about network sharing problems. You need just select restricted groups or users and every time when NetShareWatcher will find network share with access list containing that restricted groups and will perform an configured action. It allows you to easily monitor network shared folders and permissions. NetShareWatcher alerts anytime an user sets a share ACL to ""Everyone"" or some other global group that violates your data access policy as well as disable this shared folders automatically if you have selected appropriate feature in the settings. NetShareWatcher has user friendly interface and is easy to use. Being configured once, it will regularly notify you on network sharing detection with restricted permissions assigned."
