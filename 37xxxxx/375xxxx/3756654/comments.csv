There were some It. crime movies posted a while back but unfortunately they weren't in English (or w. Eng. subs) so I hope to see more."

,GET THE SWORD,2007-07-30T00:47Z,"THE DEATH DEALER (79) aka The Executioner; Almost Human; The Kidnap of Mary Lou; Milano Odia: La Polizia non Puo Sparare (The Police Cannot Shoot). Very possibly the bloodiest and most violent of all the Italian crime movies!

Does any one have this bitch?"
