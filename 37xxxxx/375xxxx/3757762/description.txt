Flawed but no longer ignored, 'Lost Songs: Volume One' is a 14 track, 60 minute collection of previously unreleased material dating from 1991-97. Featuring 'Flowermouth'-era contributions from Robert Fripp and Mel Collins and further fallout from the experimental 'Wild Opera' / 'Dry Cleaning Ray' sessions, 'Lost Songs: Volume One' is an essential purchase for the No-Man completist.
