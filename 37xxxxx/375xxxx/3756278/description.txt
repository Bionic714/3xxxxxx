The debut album from this sixties psychedelia group that gained some fame after having two songs on the soundtrack to Midnight Cowboy (you know that movie where Dustin Hoffman plays a pimp to a male hooker that always wears a cowboy hat). Also known for being John Lennons backing band on Sometime in New York City (probably less known for being Yoko Onos backing band on a record too).
This is really good psychedelia, clearly influenced by Frank Zappa and Country Joe and the Fish stoner album Electric Music for Mind and Body.
