,scobro,2008-02-20T21:47Z,"Saw them last night with Megadeth.
People were booing them.Strange."
,Nemesis1911,2008-03-07T21:30Z,"This band definitely has some promise.
Thanks a lot for the upload, much appreciated... :)"
,fasthandsdan,2008-04-21T08:27Z,Great band. I just saw them in Louisville. BTW you got 'The Rising Tide' and 'Suspended by the Throat' mixed up. I am seeding.
,T3MUL3NT,2008-04-22T15:57Z,"Doom was a pretty good album, but this is honestly the worst band I have ever seen live. They just can't play what they put on the album and make it sound the same. Bands need to not record shit that they can't play live.

Other then their live show, great band."
,out there,2008-05-25T12:01Z,"the metal scene in the usa is pretty weak, it needs all the support it can get.  please, send these guys some money for downloading their stuff - show support."
,Valium89,2008-06-29T14:09Z,scobro: if they booing for this band they r handigaps. becouse only what you have to boo is megadeth. Children of bodoms vocalist alexi laiho has doed couple of songs for megadeth. that band dont know how to do music :)
,jasonhoulton,2008-09-09T19:35Z,thnx brah XD
,acefighter007,2008-10-16T06:51Z,"man seen these guys at gigatour, such an insain mosh, would love to see them again"
,tubbychick3n,2008-12-06T07:04Z,"Nice torrent, and great download speed by the way. Averaging around 330mb/s"
,tubbychick3n,2008-12-06T07:06Z,"Hey T3MUL3NT, if you thought job for a cowboy was the worst band you've ever heard live, go to youtube and search for ""dragonforce live"" you will want to rip your eardrums out after that."
,thewallis1992,2009-03-11T21:37Z,"Doom is a great EP, but Genesis kinda sucks.  They should have never gotten a new drummer.
Thanks for the upload! Good speed. 
BTW check out my torrent if you like these guys. Bring Me The Horizon is pretty good too, although their new album isnt as good. My BMTH dicography torrent has 100 to 135 seeders usually, check them out sometime.
@T3MUL3NT
Dragonforce is really bad live, wayy worse then these guys.
