I love conspiracy theories, even though I don't believe most of them.
Anyways, I am 100% convinced that the US government did indeed know about 9/11 - maybe not participated, but they knew it for sure; and used it in their own policies.

Spread the word, m8!!"
,GORMEL1,2007-07-27T01:28Z,"I don't know if it is my computer or not, but many times when if try to follow a thread on conspiracy, i get a 404 error, or my computer locks up, or a message that this page cannot be displayed.
For instance, when I try to access the 911 call, I get a voice giving date and time, then my computer locks.
Do any of you run into the same problem? or have any answes as to why this would happen? "

I have friends and relitives in Canada... and It's not really like that. example:  june/07  A friend of mine got bit by a dog and needed stitches....yes, they didn't charge her for being seen, but she had to pay for everything else. suture, bandage wrap, antibiotics, ( which she had to pick-up at the pharmacy before she got to the hospital). fall/05 Another relitive had a sis in his lung about 1/4 inch in size. It was not ""life threatning"" at the time, so they left it....a year and a half later, it was the size of a large orange and he also had to walk around with an oxygen tank because of an inability to take in enough oxygen normally...they removed it and  it took them 6 months to clear up post infections  that occured afterwards. Summer/05  Another relitive got in a car accident... the hospital couldn't find the time to wash the glass out of her hair.....they wanted a family member to come and do it....the nearest relitive was an hour and a half away....her 78 year old father who doesn't drive... 4 days later they washed it for her. They don't have the best quality doctors because the pay is so low...a lot of Canadians actually come to the United States for major operations. They don't trust the medical system in Canada.
  If you want to fix the system...you have to take the non-medical people out of the loop when it comes to deciding health care issues...(insurance companies)
  This might not be the best system...and there things to fix, but the quality and expertise of the personal can't be touched anywhere in the world

 GET THE INSURANCE COMPANIES OUT OF THE DECISION MAKING AND GIVE IT BACK TO THE DOCTORS... simple as that"

Does that mean that the tracker is gone, or should I try again and again?
I almost have everything and believe that the message in this film needs to be spread as much as possible. It is a very good post. 
Could somebody please help or point me into the right direction. 
Thank you!"

Thank you for providing this lkobescak. Sicko is playing currently here in our ""art"" theatre. I went down to see it earlier today .  There was a very long line to buy a ticket and then an hour's wait before it would begin.  I didn't want to wait that long, so I came home and downloaded it. But I am going to see it in the theatre also next week.

I live in ""Paradise"" (Hawaii)  and the County of Hawaii last year declared a state of emergency because we have such a severe shortage of physicians in the state and particularly on the Big Island. My family physician is 69 years old and does not do hospital visits so if I have to go to the hospital I will have a different doctor every day...I have heard horror stories about this from other patients. I have to wait 8-10 hours to see him even with an appointment...I usually leave his office around midnight. Yet, I am lucky. I have a doctor. Doctors here are not taking new patients. Folks who move here cannot find a doctor and folks whose doctor retires cannot find a doctor. 

I am 64 with some chronic health problems so the movie really hit home. I had to stop it twice to go to the bathroom and vomit. I don't understand what has happened to us Americans...how we let large corporations come to run our nation. I did gain some very important, useful insights by recently reading Al Gore's new book  The Assault on Reason. I recommend it as the perfect complement to Sicko. Every American needs to see this movie and read Gore's book and then use the Net as the new Market Place of Ideas where we citizens can come to talk with each other and our elected representatives and begin to take back the excessive power that now makes our government so lopsided in favor of the executive branch.

Anyway, I'll continue to seed (if it's any good) cuz I also am a 'truth soldier' but that's mainly because I'm stealing my neighbours' wireless internet connection.

And hell yeah, the d/l speed is like a fuckin taliban suicide bomber (let's face it, they're fast)! Awesome!

In short: Thanks :)"

So keep in mind that you use a more general way of coding ur next release, asshole (XviD 1.1.3 or lower).

Other than that, superb release! I'm going to be seeding it for a few weeks :-)"

--------------------------------------------------

Every year, tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars are quietly added to the U.S. national debt -- on top of the deficits that we hear about. What's going on?

By Scott Burns
November 21, 2007

When it comes to financial magic, the government of the United States takes the prize. Sleights of hand and clever distractions by purveyors of line-of-credit mortgages, living-benefit variable annuities and equity-indexed life insurance are clumsy parlour tricks compared with the Big Magic of American politicians.

Consider the proud trumpeting that came from Washington at the close of fiscal 2007. The deficit for the unified budget was, politicians crowed, down to a mere $162.8 billion.

In fact, the U.S. government is overspending at a far greater rate. The total federal debt actually increased by $497.1 billion over the same period.

But politicians of both parties use happy numbers to distract American voters. Democrats routinely criticize the Republican administration for crippling deficits, but they politely use the least-damaging figure, the $162.8 billion. Why? Because references to more-realistic accounting would reveal vastly greater numbers and implicate both parties.

You can understand how this is done by taking a close look at a single statement on U.S. federal finance from the president's Council of Economic Advisers. The September statement shows that the ""on-budget"" numbers produced a deficit of $344.3 billion in fiscal 2007. The ""off-budget"" numbers had a surplus of $181.5 billion. (The off-budget figures are dominated by Social Security, Medicare and other programs with trust funds.)

Combine those two figures and you get the unified budget, that $162.8 billion. In the past eight years there's been two years of reported surpluses and six years of reported deficits. Altogether, the total reported deficit has run $1.3 trillion.

Some numbers don't add up 
But if you examine another figure, the gross U.S. federal debt, you'll see something strange. First, the U.S. debt has increased in each of the past eight years, even in the two years when surpluses were reported. Second, the gross federal debt, which includes the obligations held by the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, has increased much faster than the deficits -- about $3.3 trillion over the same eight years.

That's $2 trillion more than the reported $1.3 trillion in deficits over the period. Can you spell ""Enron""?

In other words, while the reported deficits averaged $164 billion over the past eight years, U.S. government debt increased an average of $418 billion a year. That's a lot more than twice as much.

How could this happen?

Easy. The U.S. Treasury Department simply credits the Social Security, Medicare and other trust funds with interest payments in the form of new Treasury obligations. No cash is actually paid. The trust funds magically increase in value with a bookkeeping entry. It represents money the American government owes itself.

So what happens if the funny money is taken away?

When the imaginary interest payments are included, Social Security and Medicare are running at a tranquilizing surplus (that $181.5 billion mentioned earlier). But measure actual cash, and the surplus disappears.

In 2005, for instance, the U.S. Social Security Disability Income program started to run at a cash loss. 2007 is the first year that Medicare Part A (the hospital insurance program) benefits exceeded income.

The same thing will happen to the U.S. Social Security retirement-income program in six to nine years, depending on which of the trustees' estimates you use. During the same period, the expenses of Medicare Part B and Part D, which are paid out of general tax revenue, will rise rapidly.

Despite this, the U.S. Social Security Administration writes workers every year advising them that the program will have a problem 34 years from now, not six or nine years. In fact, the real problem is al"
