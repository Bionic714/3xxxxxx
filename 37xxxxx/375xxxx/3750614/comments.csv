,DarkOrbitDeathPilot,2010-01-21T17:51Z,"Bro you cant d/l a -no install- game, or even cracked or reloaded, and expect your antivirus program not to find anything. I have never had a problem with dopeman's games. I run AVG 9.0 and MalwareBytes current version and the only thing, if anything, they find would be a crack or an occasional keygen. Thx for all your u/l's dopeman. "
