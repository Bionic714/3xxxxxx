Pristine quality. If you have not yet heard a DCC (Digital Compact Classics) re-master, you have not heard the album yet. This is a must have for any Jethro Tull fan.

Quote from original up-loader:

""I shouldn't have to tell you what this is. If you've found it, you most likely already know. But in case you don't, this is DCC's re-master of Jethro Tull's Original Masters compilation, which is especially noteworthy for including, unlike the original version, the entire first side of Thick as a Brick in its best-sounding CD incarnation ever."""
