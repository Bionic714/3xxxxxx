,noalukas,2010-04-19T15:32Z,"Seed would be nice, when the torrent itself is so small, its frustrating that it takes so long.

NP though if you dont seed, its kinda frustrating too."
,RSObelix,2012-04-12T21:52Z,"I found a live torrent elsewhere. I was stuck on this one (~40%), made the live one check up on it and filled it up.
Now I'm seeding, but my up-connection is slow and my computer isn't always on."
,joekal,2012-07-07T08:33Z,RSObelix where did you find that other torrent?
