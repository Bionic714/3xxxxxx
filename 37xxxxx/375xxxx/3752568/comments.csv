,Raep-FIN,2008-06-17T18:49Z,"Any precise information how to burn this game to 700mb CD-R? I'm not familiar with it, so...

...I just need detailed instructions what to do with the files extracted from the RAR-archive. Help, Relic66? I just want to play this game and when I'm happy with the results, I'll keep seeding. ;)

Thanks."
,Raep-FIN,2008-06-17T20:53Z,"Got the game working 100% w/ colors. Just burned all items to CD-R via Alcohol 120%.

Massive thanks, Relic66. I will seed as much as I can. You can count on that. :)"
,Raep-FIN,2008-06-17T20:54Z,By all items I mean --> just select .ccd-file to burn and it will burn the others files as well.
,hellaraiser,2008-09-25T13:51Z,thank you so very much to the die-hards that are seeding this after so long time... both my cd-r's of this game were too beaten up to work with the ePSXe so Im really glad to have found this =)

,Criss786,2009-07-27T22:23Z,"Hey man can u tell me how to play it on adripsx or epsxe by making a iso and not a cd...............
which file to burn in iso????"
,Criss786,2009-07-27T22:56Z,"Man great torrent!!!!!!!
I figured out the problem myself that s if u wanna play on pc & wanna make ISO u will not be able to do so coz it will say error: Avi file cannot open Thus the solution:
download- AnyToISO converter 
and then convert the .IMG to Iso then open Adripsx and chose the iso plugin in video option and click on boot file then choose the iso 2 times and you can play..................."
,Criss786,2009-07-27T22:59Z,Even though ur antivirus may say tht AnyToISO converter  contains trojan and even if it does its the only way out atleast i think so...........
,Criss786,2009-07-31T00:25Z,"Man it works on adripsx after burning. any to iso but stucks in season mode..............

dosent work on epsxe or any other than adripsx............ "
