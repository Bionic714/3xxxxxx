Works great.

I was told it was buggier than 9a466, but it seems more solid to me. Animations are faster, no more text bugs, finder loads quicker.

just have your cleint set to upload the file.  So yo should have like dl speed=50kb/sec upload speed= 35kn/sec
or something like that.  And you should be fing.  And then after you are at 100% continue to upload

installing Mac OSX Leopard without a Dual Layer DVD

PREP
Have TWO blank partitions ready. One will be for the installer and the other will be where you install Leopard.

LET?S GO

* With your disc image mounted, open the Disk Utility application (Applications -> Utilities).
*if you want to install on teh same drive, make 2 partitions first
* Click the Restore tab (see it near the top of the Disk Utility window? Just after First Aid, Erase and RAID?)
* Drag your DMG file from the list on the left of your Disk Utility window to the ?Source? field.
* Then, drag the icon of the partition you want to put the installer on to the ?Destination? field. Again, do this from the left pane of your Disk Utility window. If you try to do this from the desktop (as I kept trying to do) you?re going to drive yourself bonkers.
* Click the ?Erase Destination? check box so that it shows a check.
* I also skipped the Checksum. You might or might not want to do the same. Your call.
* Click Restore.
* Wait until done.

Once the above is complete you now have a bootable OSX Leopard Install partition.

Or if you have a DL DVD, then just partition the drive however you want and boot from teh CD, and choose the USB drive as the install directory
"
,thuglite,2007-07-31T07:28Z,does the upgrade option work better on this one or is it still recommended to do a clean install?
,philsurmac,2007-07-31T07:42Z,"@Troels999

The partition made for Leopard on your External firewire HD has to be 8Gb maximum. Maybe more could works but if you have some problem, try it.

If you have a Dual Layer DVD, burn the DMG with disk utility.  Then boot from it.

How to install Leopard with only single layer DVD media

OK, I have just created a bootable copy of the Leopard install DVD using the following method:

1. Open the Leopard installation DVD using Disk Utility.

2. Using the Disk Utility, create a new dual layer (8.5GB) sparse image called leopard (actual filename will be leopard.sparseimage) and mount it.

3. Restore the Leopard installation DVD to the mounted leopard.sparseimage (not the image file.)

4. Open the mounted leopard.sparseimage with Finder, and delete the XCodeTools directory.

5. Unmount the mounted leopard.sparseimage.

6. Using the Disk Utility, create a new single layer (4.4GB) spare image called boot (actual filename will be boot.sparseimage) and mount it.

7. Restore the leopard.sparseimage image file to the mounted boot.sparseimage (not the image file.)

8. Unmount the mounted boot.sparseimage.

9. Burn the boot.sparseimage to your single layer DVD media.

Booting from this DVD works, but takes a long time."

Okay step by step

1. Download the dmg (I'm going to call it leopard.dmg)
2. Plug in your external harddrive (I'm going to call it newdrive)
3. Open up Disk Utility
4. Click on newdrive
5. You'll see ""First Aid, Erase, Partition, RAID, Restore
6. Click on restore
7. You'll see two fields Source: and Destination:
8. For Source: select leopard.dmg from wherever it is on your harddrive
9. For Destination: drag newdrive from the Disk Utility drive list
10. Click on restore (It might take a while if you're using USB... maybe a few hours, just let it go)
11. Leave this new harddrive with leopard attached to your computer
12. Open System Preferences
13. Click on Startup Disk
14. Select newdrive with the Leopard Install
15. Restart the computer
16. Leopard install begins
17. Install it where ever you want.

When I installed it I wiped my main harddrive because I wanted to have nothing on it to interfere.... this is a beta after all. I backed up all my stuff and I'd suggest you do the same.


I wrote there the traduction of the instructions for French peolpe who want to install Leopard. I translate the step by step of Drrules.
French:

Ceci est la version BETA de Leopard nommé 9a499 présentée par Apple en juillet dernier ce n'est pas celle de la Keynote. Cette versions semble fonctionner celon les dires des autres utilisteurs je suis personellemnt toujours en train de la télécharger. Attention cette version  est aussi en français même si une petite partie reste en Anglais bouton ou autre OK amusez vous!!!


Le pas a pas

1. Télécharger le .DMG (je vais l'appeler leopard.dmg)
2. Branchez votre disque dur externe (je vais l'appeler newdrive)
3. Ouvrer Utilitaire de disque
4. Sélectionner newdrive
5. vous allez voir ""S.O.S, Effacer, Partionner, RAID, restaurer""
6. Choisissez restaurer
7. Vous allez voire deux champs Source: et Destination
8. Pour Source: selectionnez leopard.dmg là où il se trouve sur votre disque dur.
9. Pour Destination: glissez newdrive depuis la liste d'Utilitaire de Disque
10 Cliquez sur Restaurer (Celà risque de prendre beaucoup de temps si vous utilisez l'USB...peut etre quelques heures, laissez le juste faire)
11. Laissez ce nouveaux disque dur avec Leopard relier à votre ordinateur.
12. Ouvrez Préférences Système...
13. Choisissez Démarrage
14. Sélectionnez newdrive avec le logiciel d'intallation de Léopard
15. Redémarrez votre ordinateur
16. L'installation de léopard commence
17. Installelez-le où vous voullez.

Il dit que quand il a installé Léopard il a néttoyé son disque dur principal car il voulais que rien n'interfère...après tout c'est une BETA. Il a sauvergardé toutes ces données et il voudrait vous sugérer de faire la meme chose.

,balahir,2007-08-26T16:52Z,Thanks for the upload! Anybody got build 9A527?
,dr_kick,2007-08-26T21:11Z,"Can anyone tell me if Apple releases software update to fix the bugs or I have to wait for the next release? I installed it a month ago but uninstalled it as it was barely usable.
Thanks"
,zforrester,2007-08-27T20:09Z,"http://isohunt.com/torrent_details/24966073/9a527

This is, hopefully, 9a527.  I'm downloading it now, and I'll hopefully I'll find out soon enough if it's legit or not"
,zennox,2007-08-28T11:38Z,I am getting loads of hashfails with this torrent. Other torrents I am downloading are ok. It may be an idea for seeders to do a force recheck
,themarques,2007-08-28T19:22Z,"@zforrester Any update on your download if it is 9A527?

Thanks"
,gravis86,2007-08-28T19:46Z,"OK, the 9a527 torrent that was posted DOES NOT WORK.  I tried burning from both Disk Utility and Toast; neither worked.  Disk utility does not recognize the format, and will not restore the image.  Toast will not burn it because it believes the image is of an audio CD.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD.  I WILL STOP SEEDING IMMEDIATELY."
,themarques,2007-08-28T20:17Z,"Wow ok, well thats a bummer I am 2Gb into it."
,kerstman,2007-08-29T14:27Z,"I'm downloading for like 1 week now, and i'm at the last 8mb. I've uploaded 3,6GB, end downloaded 27,5 GB... so thats more than 20Gb of hash files... Does anyone knows wath the problem could be? 

Greetings"
,tenchimuy,2007-08-29T23:16Z,"Like gravis86 said, do not download the 9a527 that has been going around. It is not real and I have not seen a real one released yet. Just take any hexeditor and look at the dmg, it's 6 GB of 0's, that really pissed me off."
,kerstman,2007-08-30T14:39Z,"Thats not true, finally finisched my download, installation works till 75% so it can't only be 000's "
,funkymonkeypie,2007-08-31T07:08Z,"To all those that are having trouble downloading due to failed hash checks and getting stalled close to the end of the download:  The people at apple know a thing or two about computers and they might have a couple of servers spitting out bad data  (just a thought).  Do yourself a favor and every one else as well and use torrent software that automatically bans connections that send corrupt pieces.  (like Azureus) if you are running azureus on this download just click Tools/IP filters to see a nice list of the Mac-Ninjas that are jamming the system.  If you don't talk to them, they cant talk to you.

Not associated with any scheme."
,zforrester,2007-09-01T07:57Z,so is there anyway to actually get this thing to work? any fixes or anything like that?
,zennox,2007-09-02T22:32Z,"@funkymonkeypie, Thanks for that. Changed to azureus only got 128mb hashfails instaed of over 2gb !!!!!!! It mounted ok and installed first time with no problems am seeding +++++ now.
Thanks again"
,nivkbecjer,2007-09-04T22:57Z,"stupid question, i know, but how does one burn an image larger than 4.7gb? do they sell dvd-rs that are larger or is there some kind of compression involved?"
,acdz954,2007-09-16T22:23Z,"I have the 9a527 version and it works but I need a patch for AMD/INTEL that I couldn't find anywhere, if someone have it we could trade. I have good bandwidth and I can Seed. Ok thats all."
,Tramposch,2007-12-06T20:23Z,is this for ppc?
