Install Windows Vista in a virtual PC on your XP desktop, tweak and learn, before using it as the main Operating System.

If you're using Windows Vista, and need somewhere to play your games, install VMware Workstation 6 under Vista, and download a torrent with the install-CD of Windows XP to install and run in a virtual PC on your Vista desktop: A perfect free extra PC to run your favourite games or applications in, without having to buy the extra hardware..."

I've also got a 100 % of this VMware Workstation 6, and am also uploading this at the same speed. I know there are many other torrents for this program here; but this was the first I downloaded, and it works fine with me."
