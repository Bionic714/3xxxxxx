Having your own personal cleaning company for your Windows┬« computer. Like a professional cleaner, the program knows exactly what kind of dirt to look for, where to find it and how to get rid of it efficiently and without damaging anything else. Just as dirt and trash accumulate in buildings and factories in the course of time, unnecessary data and "leftover files" gradually collect in all Windows installations as you use them.
