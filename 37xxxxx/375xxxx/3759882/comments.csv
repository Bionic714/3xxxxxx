,squidfanny,2007-08-01T19:52Z,"there was a slight error with the previous upload of this mix, which may have made it un-searchable. This was my fault, because I was really stoned. 
I have uploaded it again with the full filename, including keyword (acid techno). Plenty more great mixes coming up, just for you and all the other acid heads.. Watch this space...................squidfanny"
,squidfanny,2007-08-01T20:42Z,"NOTE - upload/download speeds increase massivly after 11.30pm UK time. This is because internet speed is heavily throttled by the internet providers during daytime hours. Please be patient when downloading my files, and also please seed for as long as you can. 
I need help uploading my files..... if you have a good internet connection then please contact me if you can help - squidfanny@yahoo.co.uk"
