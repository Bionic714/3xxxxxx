I don't mean that's a better file, I mean it's the exact same file.  Check the file sizes.  "
,yukichigai,2007-08-03T13:21Z,"And yes, this is the ""pre"" version with a few special effects missing, particularly some of the arm stuff.  In addition to being able to see green dots on Michelle Ryan's arm, there's also a diagonal red line drawn through the entire picture in the parts where the special effects aren't finished."

,mr_piracy,2007-09-20T23:15Z,Also amazon has THE REAL PILOT episode.
,yukichigai,2007-10-30T12:06Z,"Last time I checked, mr. piracy, $1.99 is not ""free"".

More to the point, this is the ORIGINAL pilot episode with the deaf sister and a few other, minor differences that you won't find on that official version.  Not that it much matters anymore given that the show is currently on the air, but if someone really wanted to see the original pilot this is probably the only way left."
,torrentlover83,2008-03-10T12:22Z,"This is the pilot episode they didn't like.  By ""They"" I mean test audiences and executives alike.  There are differences here, to what you saw on TV, but the main difference is the deaf, punk, vaguely foreign looking sister of Jamie, whuch would have been an interesting take, (superwoman and disabled woman combo) but ultimately we can agree the second choice for her sister was better!  If you're looking for continuity, this is not for you, if you're a completist, download this and the TV-aired episodes."
