,DarthBubba,2007-08-02T07:44Z,"While I appreciate your efforts, what is this fascination people have with encoding audiobooks into iPod-only format?  Please consider using .mp3 in the future, as not all of us own - or ever will own - an iPod.  Remember, iPods can play .mp3s, as can Zunes and most of Sony's players."
,DarthBubba,2007-08-05T08:12Z,"llamalord54231, you're missing my point.  Why encode the files in a proprietary, DRM infected format that limits useability?  Use an encoder EVERYBODY has access to.  Even .wma would be a better choice than .m4a/.m4b - my car's CD player can read .wma and .mp3, as well as .wav files."
,londoneritalian,2007-08-06T12:33Z,"Hi All!
DarthBubba, I've encoded them in m4b because it is a standard for the audiobooks. Not only this, the m4b format is capable of maintaining the position like a bookmark, thing that a mp3 file cannot do. More than this there is NO DRM in the files you have downloaded and they are easily convertible in MP3 format.

PS: I repeat, I have uploaded what I use!"
,DarthBubba,2007-08-07T08:00Z,"@londoneritalian:
""a standard for the audiobooks""?  Pass me some of whatever it is you're smoking, d00d!  Just out of curiosity (and boredom, perhaps) I looked in the last 15 audiobooks uploaded when I logged in (from Bram Stoker's Dracula to the two Donna Leon books).  Two torrents were indeterminant due to use of .zip or .rar compression, one was .wma files, one was for iPod, and the rest were in .mp3 format!  A ""standard"" among iPod fanboys perhaps.

WRT the bookmarking function: is that due to the .m4b format, or something done by the iPod or iTunes software?

""PS: I repeat, I have uploaded what I use!"" - You never said that in the first place, but why don't you upload something we all can use?  I'm sure .mp3 also can be easily converted to m4b."
,gcason,2007-08-12T00:52Z,"You iPod haters are missing the point.  All the books are already available as MP3.  Do a search before you pounce on someone.

This is in a different format for another group of users.  If you don't have an iPod, then simply download the MP3 version and quitcherbitchin.   Don't hassle someone for a good torrent.  This format is the standard for iPod audiobooks.  "
,gcason,2007-08-12T00:56Z,And DarthBubba needs to chill a little.  Jeez.
,Dexie,2007-08-23T21:29Z,"lolz i don't give a shit whether its .mp3 .m4b .wma, as long as its free. GJ londoneritalian. keep that shit coming, the warez must flow ;)"
,LsnilletS,2007-09-08T13:10Z,"thanks a lot londoneritalian for this. it is all great books and really nice with a torrent that has all in one. 
Thanks =)"
,Lown,2007-09-23T12:40Z,You can play these in VLC player without converting
,cyberfox73,2007-10-02T23:36Z,"These files look like they're in a protected .mb4 format, meaning they are LOCKED iTunes files which REQUIRE A PASSWORD to play them. Has anyone managed to download these and successfully play them back?"
,Sanicle,2007-11-08T17:42Z,"I agree that encoding in m4b format is pointless. everyone can play mp3. Not everyone can play m4b. If the i-pod fans want their precious bookmarking I'm pretty sure they can run the files through I-tunes themselves since they're the one group pretty much guaranteed to have it already installed. As for the rest of us, I'm pretty sure we'd rather just be able to click ""play"" in our favourite media player, or drag and drop to our non-apple MP3 player safe in the knowledge that it will work without any problems. 

PS - while MP3 may not have bookmarking built in, there are plenty of media players and MP3 players with the ability to do it themselves, so even that is a pretty lame reason for using m4b."
,Kaupo,2007-11-20T16:36Z,lol... Well I would say. Don't complain and read a book if you don't like that format! 
,drainbread,2007-12-03T19:59Z,".m4a/b can be played in Winamp and .m4p can be used also, if you can find the plugin.

add "";M4B"""
,_-I-_,2008-01-06T21:14Z,"hmmz nic torrent perhaps. but ... THE mayor standard for TRUE audio-books is DAISY - 
witch is relayant on basic mp3 files for the audio part... 

on the other hand, just just your own recoder to convert to it...  - but for real if we would al post daisy-iso's it would be way easier for all"
,Blackhawk1969,2008-01-10T09:51Z,"ipod? arent those apple things that you have to throw away when the battery can no longer be charged? ouch..sounds like a rotten apple to me, i might get one when they have replaceable batteries... until then im stuck with my $40 mp3 player that  runs on one chargeable triple A bat for about 10hrs or more. I feel your hatred swelling inside you darth bubba...although there is good in you yet...."
,Blackhawk1969,2008-01-10T09:59Z,imagine the humiliation and m4b must feel when its converted to an mp3.....to simply tear its chapters away as if they never existed and leave it one fat lump of a chapter-less single mp3. just dont accidently hit the next button...thats one fuck of a long fast forward. 
,Blackhawk1969,2008-01-10T10:02Z,good torrent though...cant be a hater. i may try to convert the ones i need
,Blackhawk1969,2008-01-10T10:02Z,good torrent...going to convert the ones i need
,jjdwnldn,2008-01-12T08:20Z,Is there a encoder download that I can put this into mp3?  Thanks.
,kummyquat,2008-01-17T15:05Z,"You guys need to get your facts straight.

.M4A and .M4B formats *support* DRM just like WMA and WMV. They don't automatically HAVE DRM though.

These files are DRM-free. They're encoded in the standard AAC format, which is quite a bit superior to MP3 due to its efficiency (sounds better at equivalent bitrates).

.M4B files also support Apple's very handy chaptering tool.

Convert the AAC files to MP3 using any converter you wish. There are hundreds out there. Or, if you have an iPod, use them as they are."
,bball2,2008-01-20T11:25Z,"I like to code all my audiobooks in m4b format since I always use an iPod.

The problem is you can't join m4b files, you have to  rename the files to m4a, then convert to mp3, then join them, convert to m4a, then rename to m4b.

It's easier to just upload mp3s as single files then make your own audiobooks in whatever format you prefer."
,nsjordan,2008-03-16T04:44Z,"PLEASE SEED!!! This torrent is behaving like it's dead, but the stats say it isn't. Any suggestions? (I am quite new to this.)"
,monkeyword,2008-03-16T22:17Z,"Uhm guyz...plz seed...i really love to have it...no matter the format i got an ipod ;)...but theres only 1 active seeder and im sure he reduced uploads to 0.00000000001kb/s...

,Jamboskey,2008-10-06T23:06Z,"Seed anyone?

Thanks in Advance....and Thanks for taking time to make this!!"
,Danarr,2008-12-21T12:15Z,Everyone who is complaining about m4b needs to realize its a much more convenient format for an ipod. Its also incredibly ez to convert m4b to mp3 but not vice versa. thanks for the upload.
,Danarr,2008-12-21T12:16Z,Does anyone have a preference between Stephen fry/ Jim Dale read potter books?
,rodrigoque,2009-07-19T12:15Z,please seed more. thanks in advance
