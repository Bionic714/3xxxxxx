This is the fourth one in a series of shows about Ancient Prophecies.  It's pretty good quality for the age.  It originally aired on NBC in the 1990's.  I have II & III and maybe the first one too.  Well take care all.  Rembember it's in Xvid format and 1hr30min long w/ commercial cut out.  Take care all
