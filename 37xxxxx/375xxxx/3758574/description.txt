This is the full collection of raw scans for Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou, published in English as His and Her Circunstances.

The text uses easy, everyday constructs, with furigana in every kanji, making this a great first read for people learning the Japanese language.

These scans are not mine, but collected from IRC distributors around the internet. Enjoy!
