,kris0783,2007-08-08T23:32Z,"It seems that nobody knows.
But does anybody know if the show has been cancelled, and thats why there arent any more episodes?"
,NedMark,2007-08-09T05:12Z,"Guys, these 4 episodes were released by Showtime as a promo.  These are also the 4 episodes given to critics and media.  General idea is that by releasing these 4 episodes, those who watched the first 2 seasons via DVD or by downloading illegally may get so into the show that they subscribe.  The only downside to these 4 is that we won't get Ep 5 until its first air, in over a month.  Also, Weeds is signed for a 4th season."
,kris0783,2007-08-09T12:50Z,"Ahh, Thanks man. 
That cleared things up a bit.."
