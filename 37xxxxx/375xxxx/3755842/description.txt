Noreaga has been a prime peddler of street-level drama and ghetto anthems ever since his 1997 debut (with Capone), The War Report. While his solo debut, N.O.R.E., lacks the sheer fatalism of his Queens, New York, peers Nas and Mobb Deep, Noreaga is unrepentant in his thugged-out exultation of fast money, fast love, and fast life. Because of his penchant for penning confusing tales that tend toward the cryptic (see the title track), Noreaga might appeal only to an audience eager to listen to stories of project life--just so long as they don't have to live it for themselves. Mostly mediocre production also weakens the album. It's only on two tracks, "Mathematics (Esta Loca)" and "Body in the Trunk," that we glimpse the potential for Noreaga's gifts. --Oliver Wang
