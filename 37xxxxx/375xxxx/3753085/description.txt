Here is a nice COC show from their tour with Metallica in europe, not many shows shot of COC from this tour but this show would be superior
to any other version anyway. Filmed by S.B.V (aka Havrefras). Video8 mastertape provided by havrefras, thanks for beeing so nice so I could
rip this show and share it to the masses

Notes: As I said, this was the last show in europe with metallica, I think they bands are goofing of alot, its pretty fun to see this show because
of that.



Also a special thanks to jackie (aka metmum) for helping me out with the setlist!
