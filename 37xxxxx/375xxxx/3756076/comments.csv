Or, it you don't have access to the NY Times...

""Dr. Miller's data reveal some yawning gaps in basic knowledge. American adults in general do not understand what molecules are (other than that they are really small). Fewer than a third can identify DNA as a key to heredity. Only about 10 percent know what radiation is. One adult American in five thinks the Sun revolves around the Earth, an idea science had abandoned by the 17th century.""

""""Our best university graduates are world-class by any definition,"" he said. ""But the second half of our high school population - it's an embarrassment. We have left behind a lot of people.""""

Furthermore, 10 percent of all Americans can't read nor write. So yeah, I'd say that Americans are the black sheep of the human race, and that the fact that they have so much influence in the world will be a decisive factor which contributes to the end of the world."

If you don't like the fact that there are peoples heads in the shot, goto your local cinema and pay an extortionate amount of money to sit squashed into an uncomfortably small seat next to some wanker who wont stop talking in a room with the heating turned up to hot as hell.

Oh and by the way, the guy infront of you is probably six foot tall so you got his head blocking a quater of the screen all the way through!
