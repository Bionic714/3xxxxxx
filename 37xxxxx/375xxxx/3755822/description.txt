Considering that most Golden Era rap talents birthed by Dr. Dre have ridden off into the sunset--or are simply much less active and relevant in 2004--it's somewhat surprising that Snoop keeps churning out the hits like it was 1993. Make no mistake, Snoop's raps are still very much gangsta, as the title of the disc implies and as "Bang Out" clearly outlines. They're just a bit more adult-contemporary gangsta now. Despite the heavy pro-pimp overtones, the Doggfather's smoothed-out timbre and flow mask the harshness of his regressive views. The exceptional production throughout is highlighted by the Neptunes' contributions, from the catchy, minimalist "Drop It Like It's Hot" all the way to the '80s retro-funk jam "Let's Get Blown." Steady vocal contributions from funk stalwart Charlie Wilson (Gap Band) and 50 Cent, and nasty beats supplied by everyone from the Alchemist to Hi-Tek put this one over the top. --Dalton Higgins
