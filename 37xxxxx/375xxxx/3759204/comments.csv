To burn a disk u must use any tool which converts avi to dvd format, such as roxio, winavi or convertxtodvd(my favorite). They work with subtitles, as well. I only use Toast 8(pitty no subt. support), i gave up windows, got a my Macbook pro(thanx God). But these progs worked flawlessly with me on xp. VLC's king for watching. Take care"

,maryjay,2007-10-02T14:57Z,"if you want to seed back what you received then just leave your torrent client(utorrent etc) open/running when you finish downloading.
the piratebay could do with some more peeps sharing. too many smash and grabs around."

,Wolfeymole,2007-10-11T16:25Z,"From Lessah
""mp4 really sucks! none of my programs can play it propertly, i'l just wait until axxo's release with avi format gets out..""

I have to totaly agree Lessah.

Be aware people that in the MP4 format you will need to convert it to AVI.
This is more trouble that it's worth."

Just goto your local DVD rental store, rent and burn. Then you will have DVD quality along with a perfect copy in 20 minutes with less of a headache."

,helstondave,2008-08-29T17:13Z,As its in MP4 you my need to download Magic Video Converter version 8 found in Applications on here.  That will convert it easily to AVI format which will then play in Windows media player.
