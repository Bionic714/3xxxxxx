After reading your post, I decided to get this and not waste my time with other junk that's no good and shouldn't even be on here!
I wish others would post after dloading a torrent to let us peeps know that torrent is good/bad has bugz/no bugs etc...but i guess that's just too much to ask for eh?

Thanx masseur :)"

,Zermelo,2007-11-19T07:13Z,"If FRAPS won't start it's because you downloaded the demo version and certain registry entries need to be cleaned out.  Just follow the instructions on this link:

and it will fix the problem."
