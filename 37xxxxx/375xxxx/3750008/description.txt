"Ripped" with DVD Shrink

Burned once with IMGBURN, worked fine in home dvd player

I don't take the info in this movie without question, but it is quite astonishing either way. Great work.

I originally downloaded the movie from google video, but wanted a better quality version. After looking on pirate bay I found a DVD Rip that I could never get to work in my dvd player, so I ordered a dvd from the guy who made the movie and wanted to provide this ISO for all to see.

Enjoy and seed!
