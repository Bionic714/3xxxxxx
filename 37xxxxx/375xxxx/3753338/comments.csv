maybe the crack in gamecopyworld.com was originally from TPB. "
,Surfdragon,2007-07-26T18:00Z,"no idea, I didn't find a torrent with the 3rd .main .dll here.. anyway.. it's working!"
,Mr Silver,2007-07-27T14:38Z,"Like a lot of people maybe, missed it first time around so thanks a bunch for the up Surfdragon."
,sila.no,2007-07-27T21:27Z,"Hello Surfdragon.
Installed the SP1 and replaced the 3 dll's. Now FSX is worse than ever. What have I done wrong?
Do you have some idea.
Best regards
Noob: sila.no"
,GrifterGrifts,2007-07-28T14:01Z,"sila.no, I had the same problem. If you're getting high FPS, but intermittent stutters, do this:

Set your FPS to unlimited, and monitor your FPS using Fraps. Once you have an idea of what your average FPS is, set the limit to just below that number.

I get between 30 and 55 FPS, but average around 42. I set my limit to 41, and... NO STUTTERING!"
,horntails,2007-07-31T12:43Z,it's working! thanks!
,sila.no,2007-08-01T23:55Z,"GrifterGrifts
Tnx for the tip, but as a noob I don't know what you mean with FRAPS. How do I use FRAPS? I have tried differtent FPS-settings, but still I have stuttering. Could it be that I have too many details in the sceenery? I hope you or someone else bother to help me.
Best regards sila.no"

,rossirep,2007-08-19T11:13Z,"Installed FSX - selected Activate later - Installed SP1 - copied 3.dll's - First try at load FSX  hangs... second time Worked like a treat! Cheers, nice to haev the sevice pack 1 installed. 
Still cant max settings out - even with a 320mb 8800 gts, and core 2 duo chip at 2.8ghz and 2 gig ddr2 ram....  looks like vista needs 4gb ram. neal"
,FrozenPenguin,2007-10-22T15:17Z,Installed SP1. Got the dreaded activation screen. Closed out. Installed this 3 file crack. Loaded FSX again and shazam! Booted right into FSX. Crack WORKS! Thanks Surfdragon from the navy outpost in Antarctica.
,NO_BS,2007-10-29T18:56Z,"sila.no, just search ""fraps"" here at The Pirate Bay, and you'll find the program. Just install it, then run it. When you runa game, your FPS will be displayed in the upper left corner so you will know what your average is. Just watch it for about 2 minutes to get a feel for your average... Then set your FSX frame limit to that number."
,judasmyguide,2007-10-29T20:38Z,"Thx.  But is this sp1. or just the dll's after you have innstalled sp1?  If so,  where the f... can i download sp1.  Cant find on piratebay."
