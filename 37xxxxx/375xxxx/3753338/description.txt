Hey flightfans,

There is a crack out for Flight Simulator X after you installed Service Pack 1.

On my AMD Athlon 2400+ 1700 Mhz, 1 Gb SDRAM pc I can now play Flight Simulator X without it looking like a really fast slideshow. In fact, it runs just as smooth as FS2004! I found it on gamecopyworld.com but I just wanted to share it, since this one has the 3rd .dll too to stop the timer. The other FSX cracks I have found sofar on TPB only contain 2 dll's. 

So no nag-screens, no activation, just install FSX, install SP1, replace the 3 .dll's in the gamefolder, take off without worries!
