,Deputy276,2008-05-30T01:56Z,Language is SPANISH. THere is NO English in the movie at all.
,alfajack,2009-03-12T22:10Z,"Wrong, only the titles and navigation are strictly in Spanish. Simply select the language/subtitle option from the main menu (item #3), pick the first language option (not Castellano) and the second subtitle option (no subtitles) and enjoy the movie in english   

THANKS Atrheas!!!
