A transmission from the fictitious television network The Voice. Fundamental Christians and Muslims have finally found out that their basic values are pretty much the same. They join forces and take command of the prosperous northern hemisphere. The rest of the planet is about to be sealed off by a giant world wide wall. Villains, heathens and other evil people stay on that other side of the wall. Long live the Great Northern Union!!! But nobody is safe, the threat is impending. Is the enemy among us? Where is the solution to the problem? The Voice Television Network gives us an answer. The film uses the same technique as in the Read My Lips series. All pictures come from archives. Famous and infamous personalities participate as hosts and spokesmen. In leading roles we find, for example, Jean-Marie Le Pen (the French right wing leader), a number of American presidents (with Mr. Bush as chief commander), Ayatollah Khamenei, Adolf Hitler, Usama Bin Laden, etc. Written by Kristina Åberg
