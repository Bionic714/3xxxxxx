,shmuckhead,2007-08-01T01:43Z,"We can only hope, my dear Doctor, we can only hope. 

Truth be told, I tend to feel a bit sorry for the lad. It must be a sad existence when the depth of your self-portrait is naught but a slur of bad language used as an attempt to feel a sense of power, on a flight simulation forum no less. That kind of behaviour conceals, though not well, a tragic lack of self-esteem in the real world."
,Sergiow,2007-08-01T13:38Z,"this doesn't work, when i launch the setup it wants to uninstall??"

,tam408,2007-09-23T20:54Z,"Thanks for the release, GMT !
Neff, you dont need to run the installer... its already installed ( RIP ). You just need to put the folder Hawaii Oahu in your FSX folder and activate in the scenery library. Its working perfect."
,the-uploader-boy,2007-10-14T19:08Z,Exacly
