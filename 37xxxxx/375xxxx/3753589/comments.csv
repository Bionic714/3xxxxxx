,WJakobW,2007-09-02T15:31Z,"Lol, can someone tell me why they have ""Voice-Overs"" at the CD? Haven't listened to a more annoying CD since I was a little child and they played Children-Songs for me..."
,rainingblood0187,2007-10-21T06:23Z,"i think the voice overs are some kind of piracy protection. 

cuz if u look at the top it says its the advance copy, not the final release."
,johnnybigoode,2007-11-27T14:12Z,"don't bother, voice overs"
,roonz,2010-05-29T09:19Z,"Wow, wasted 5 days to download and this has voice-overs."
