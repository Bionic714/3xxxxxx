,Vorperblad,2008-01-21T02:56Z,"Thanx Buzzer79 for this one. The addons are great. Now would you guys please see-ee-ee-d.??

I have 12 peers stuck on 99.3% for like the last 24 hrs. I've uploaded 341Mb and still no complete file. 

See-ee-ee-d please??

Want other expansions.? I'm seeding this link for ever.

,fritzjoel,2008-01-23T00:56Z,The same.  I am stuck at 99.3% downloaded.  Please seed!  Thanks!
,Vorperblad,2008-01-26T08:01Z,"Anyone gonna SEE-EE-EE-D??? Looks like another dead-end waste-o'-time & bandwidth for the IL-2 fans.

Really cheezes ya off when the Primary Seeder just nicks off & leaves the torrent for dead! I & my peers stuck on 99.3% for about 3 weeks now! Even w/ 430Mb uploaded to all the other 99.3 per-centers still no complete file. Hey shit if I'd just get a sniff of the last 7/10ths of the complete file, I'd bloody well seed it for all of you.

I guess the leaching world is full of greedy selfish poeple after all. No offense intended of course."
,Vorperblad,2008-02-11T01:56Z,These two IL2 Sturmovik addons can also be found ->fully seeded
