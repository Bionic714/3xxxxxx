,TheLunchLady,2008-02-15T00:27Z,"I get sound but no video when trying to start 07 and 08 of WSOP. I called activision they said the game has issues with ATI X series cards. Why on earth wouldnt they test out those cards before publishing the game. Those are popular cards. Anywho activision told me to just install the gfx drivers and not the catalyst. I tried that and still the same problem. So I tried that on my media center pc and that seemed to work. I was able to play the game for a day, Now the game just gives me the blue screen of death about 1 minute into the game. Anyone figure out a way to get this to work?"
