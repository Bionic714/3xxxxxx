Fiddlin' John Carson plays a good mix of Folk, Country and Old timey
music on a Fiddle and was the First Country musician to be Recorded
and to play on the radio. He won the Georgia Fiddling competition
seven times throughout his life time, which goes to show that he must
have been one of the best fiddlers in the South dure in the earlier
part of the 20th century.

--------Fiddlin' John Carson - Volume IV (1925 - 1926)--------

This music was purchased from Document-Records.co.uk where
Fiddlin' John Carson's other six volumes can be found, 
enjoy whats here, my favorate/ most recommended songs out of 
these are "Everybody works but Father", "Peter went Fishing",
"Don't Let your deal go down" and "Swanee River". I may upload
the other volumes that I have (5, 6 & 7) as I believe that this
music needs to be listened to rather than forgotten in history.
