DJ Squidfanny - tool time - UK ACID TECHNO

MP3 @ 192k.......77 minutes, but it WILL still fit on a normal CD. Burn with nero if you\'re not sure. Otherwise just play from MP3.

Please seed for as long as you can, otherwise I will cut you a new fanny and violate it with mt eight tentacles.

If you like it then feel free to contact me - \'squidfanny@yahoo.co.uk\'. If you don\'t then fuck off and make your own mix, and then upload it and complain that no-body is seeding...........
