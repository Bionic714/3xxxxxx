,xhizors,2007-08-02T04:06Z,yeah sorry technical difficulties because i had to get ubuntu up. but it's going now. as douche bag downloads torrents in the next room. i have to close his uTorrent when he's not around then it'll go a lot faster.

   when you're done downloading just open TheGalmorousLife...-xhizors.zip and it will piece all the sections together automatically."

,jnjdnri,2008-03-03T21:16Z,can't unzip them at all. Trying to unzip the file TheGalmorousLife...-xhizors.zip with StuffitDeluxe12.0.1 (latest version) I get: An error has occurred while opening the archive. The StuffIt Engine was unable to determine the file format. How did you manage to?
