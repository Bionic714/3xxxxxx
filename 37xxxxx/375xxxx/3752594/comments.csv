,jimson111,2007-07-25T18:48Z,excuse me for upploading it again...a technical error on my disc occured...
,tekmage3000,2007-07-26T02:44Z,"No problem, just glad to see the show again. I'll seed it out as long as I am able once I get it all."
,jimson111,2007-07-27T23:51Z,"ok, about the seeding - I'll do the same :); and one more thing: since English is not my native language, I do not cope with spoken English quite well, so does anybody have the English subtitles/script to the movie? I (and some other people) would appreciate it greatly..."
,Goonrgrrl,2007-09-05T00:54Z,"Jimson, thank you so, so much for this!  Been looking for ages - this was the only torrent I could get to.

Is there any chance someone else could keep seeding for a bit?  I'm stuck at 86%.  I promise I'll keep seeding for a good while!"
,jimson111,2007-09-06T00:48Z,"By the way, I started making the subtitles myself. Subs for several episodes are already uploaded at http://subscene.com/. There might be mistakes in there (I hope, not many...), the timing could be done better...Well, I've been improving my skills. Anyway, that was my first attempt."
,fcdotarmy,2007-12-15T01:37Z,"Thanks for seeding this. I downloaded and re-seeded the series. Unfortunately the last two episodes are corrupted so I had to unseed them to try to download good copies of those two files. Does anyone have good copies of ""Parallel Lives"" and ""Reunion""?"
,Comodore128,2008-01-10T11:55Z,"I will also Seed this excelent torrent. i too have been looking for this a long time.
Im SErving this torrent on the IRC to spread it
further. Are there any chance for a Season II?"
,Comodore128,2008-01-11T01:43Z,"jimson111, do you have more seasons of this Series?"
,jimson111,2008-02-16T18:07Z,"No, this is the only season shot. And the last one. It was cancelled by FOX, because they next released shows like ""Sliders"" which they found to be similar (I don't think so: VR.5 feels absolutely unique!) and VR.5 lost the contest...VR was stolen in parts...the blue tunnel went here, ""The Committee"" went there...and so on.
Even some actors were eager to continue participating in further VR episodes, but...:=(

I do not understand about the two corrupted episodes - how that happened if my own files were ok?"
,ohverture,2008-12-31T03:52Z,"Have been after this forever. Thanks a plenty!
I'll seed for ages"
,youngtad,2009-01-31T08:59Z,Hi!-  Thanks for the shows....the first three shows seem to be unplayable...should I try to download again?  Or is there a problem with these episodes?
,SavSyd,2009-05-10T17:19Z,"Thank you. These are not easy to find. To bad they where never released on dvd. I have only found them on VHS. 

I guess (estimating the file size) that the quality isn't the best, but I guess this series have never been shown in HD-quality anyway.

Thanks again!"
,SavSyd,2009-05-13T13:05Z,"Too bad. The quality sucks bigtime. It was worse than I feared. Great show and thanks for providing a ""lost"" series, but it is not watchable..."
,ikativan,2009-06-23T05:10Z,"Thanks jimson111!!!
For 90s series without DVD edition quality is O.K!
Too bad Fox cancelled it soooo fast!Great show!"
,maddyjames,2009-10-19T16:03Z,hey! thanks so much for the upload! so are parallel lives and reunion now fixed? 
,ma-meido,2010-05-14T23:48Z,Amazing! Been looking for this series for ages. Made a huge impression when I was young. Pls seed! Thank you :)
,Zarod,2010-11-16T17:02Z,This is totally sweet.  I completely forgot about this series until I was browsing sci-fi stuff on MSN.  Then I suddenly had a thought to search for the series and found it.  Thanks for the upload!  Can't wait to watch it again!  Thanks also to those who are seeding!
,akhijaga,2011-01-21T07:11Z,please keep on seeding! thanks for these series!
,sirneon1,2012-01-22T01:55Z,Getting this one; I'm trying to archive a bunch of old VHS from Mom and Dad's collection.
