Summary:  The liner notes: 
It was one of the Darthelvesâ?? greatest exploits: getting into the ABC TV vault, finding the 35mm film broadcast master â?? complete with space for commercial breaks and â?? not seen since the original broadcast â?? Boston Pops conductor Arthur Fiedlerâ??s introduction. Here it is, in far better quality than is typically seen. Naturally, the restored version, if Apple ever sees fit to release it, will probably blow this away. But it will also be a very different edit. Here it is, as ABC broadcast it on  January 10, 1967          ---  Neo, 2006
