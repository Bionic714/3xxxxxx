RELEASE iNFOS

Trojan Remover was written to aid in the removal of Trojan Horses
and Internet Worms when standard anti-virus software has either
failed to detect the problem or is unable to effectively eliminate it.

Trojan Remover has been written for Windows
95/98/Millennium/XP/Server 2003. It has been successfully
used by Windows 2000 users, although this platform has not been
officially tested.
The majority of Virus and Trojan Scanners are well able to detect
malicious Trojan Horses and Internet Worms but are not always
very efficient in removing them once they have been triggered.
Trojan Remover was written specifically to carry out such a
removal without the user having to manually edit system files,
including the Registry. The program also removes the additional
system modifications some Trojans carry out which are ignored
by other Virus and Trojan Scanners.

iNSTALL NOTES

1. Unpack & Install.
2. Replace all files.

Special Notes :

On some antivirus scan, FFF releases packages can reveal
"Type_Win32" or "Trojan_Type" virus ...
Don't be stupid ! It's not a virus or anything else like
that. Just some packers/cryptors which have same binary
signature.

But some crackhost can modify or add malicious things on
FFF releases (like "crack.exe", so please take care.

Remember:
You've downloaded this software and you're using a crack.
It's your choice... Not mine. So, don't blame me.
