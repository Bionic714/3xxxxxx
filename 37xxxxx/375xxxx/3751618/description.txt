Set List:
01 - Young Modern Station
02 - Emotion Sickness
03 - The Greatest View
04 - Luv Your Life
05 - The Door
06 - Ana's Song (open fire)
07 - Insomnia
08 - Straight lines

Notes:
The set list above is as it appeared on the televised concert shown by ABC2, and does not include
6 songs that were played in the original set list. This was probably to keep the show within an 
hour timeframe. The songs not included in this release are floating around in mp3 format, but not 
video. 

Apart from that, we hope you enjoy a fine performance by Silverchair!
