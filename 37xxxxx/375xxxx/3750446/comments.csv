,Bukkaneeri,2007-07-26T21:22Z,You need a custom firmware and I don't think 3.52 can be downgraded at this time.

,Bukkaneeri,2007-08-05T11:01Z,On your PSP memorystick go to to folder labelled PSP and then go into GAME (or GAME340 this depends on what have you set to be your homebrew folder) and just put the Resident Evil 3 folder.

,casperboo,2007-12-12T02:05Z,"Ya know what is really gay?  When people that are too stupid to know that you can't run PSX Game ISOs on standard retail firmware and complain about it like it is the fault of the torrent poster that they were born with below average intelligence.

And if you think I am insulting your intelligence wrongly, then think again.  You actually thought that Sony would release the PSP with the ability to play games from the PS1 just by copying over an ISO?  My God, you are on a torrent site to get a hold of warez and you have no brains to do research on an expensive handheld game console.  How long have you owned it that you just now figured out you can crack the firmware.  Without cracked firmware, the PSP is USELESS with the pathetic amount of movies and games available."
,Criticalt3,2007-12-22T05:24Z,"I can launch the game fine, I'm using 3.71 M33, but when I start a new game it plays the cinematics, white text comes up at the bottom, I'm assuming that's Allas talking, but then it just stays black. And the only thing I can do is press home and choose to restart or quit the game, basically. So what's wrong with it? I'm also using IR Shell, as a XMB Replacement."
,Bukkaneeri,2007-12-28T15:25Z,This was converted from the NTSC version and it's not 3.71 M33 compatible. I read that PAL version will work even with 3.71 M33 firmwares.

,doggy_444,2009-04-07T18:00Z,I'm stuck at the PlayStation logo too... any suggestions?
,doggy_444,2009-04-08T15:14Z,"Sorry for double post.

Found out the solution : PoPsLoader.

Google search ""pops pack popsloader"" and download for your firmware.

Install it on your PSP, activate it from the boot menu and then enter the game. It should work now."
