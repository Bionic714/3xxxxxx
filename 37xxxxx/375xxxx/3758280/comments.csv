I didn´t even have to erase the Sib 4 installation. If you plan to do this remember to answer NO when the installer asks wheather or not you have a previously installed copy of Sibelius.. And then just register by phone this the keygen... "
,TILT56,2007-07-31T03:24Z,Thanks therpandurs..........
,ws616,2007-08-02T00:57Z,"I'm seeding as much as there is demand for - it's going slow though, but how do you make the program work - you write in the titel a keygen is included, but here you write about to phone ?"
,therpandrus,2007-08-02T04:45Z,"Ok... Iknow it's going slow but actually i'm on vacation and i am seeding this from my laptop in a hotel using the wireless network. So please understand... Now let me clarify on the installation process. I think i should've included the instuctions too.. sorry about that.
I you have some trouble I will try to help. Remember this sure works. I just installed it and it does perfectly. 

Now check this out. This are the actual instructions on the weasel kgen by the weasel


Instructions 
------------

1.  Install Sibelius.

2.  Start Sibelius and make sure you answer 'no' to the question about
having an earlier version.  You will now be asked for a serial.  Start the
keygen and read the instructions displayed.  You can enter E or G as many
times as you like to generate an appropriate serial for your language
version,   Enter the serial into Sibby and keep the keygen running.  Click
OK and select 'Register by fax or phone' in the next dialog.  Now go back to
the keygen and type C  and at the prompt enter the computer number
appearing in the dialog (16 decimal digits).  A registration number will be
generated (R followed by 16 decimal digits).  Transfer it to the Sibby reg.
dialog (You have to type it!).  Quit and restart Sibby to make sure your
registration sticks.

3.  You can also enter your own serial if you have one by entering S.  The
keygen makes no checks other than length (16 or 19 chars) so make sure you
get it right!  If you enter only 16 chars (e.g scep123456789012) the keygen
will add the check digits for you so you can use this method to generate a
key with a pleasing sequence of digits, though not all are guaranteed to
work!

BTW - the '2' appearing in character position 14 of each generated SN is not
a watermark - it seems the proggy requires it.

Have fun!

Another fine release from WeASeL.

 During the Essentials install, the progress stops at Sibelius Sounds Essentials_001.nkx and does not progress even if left for hours. The progress bar stated ""0 minutes 0 seconds"" remaining.  I have re-downloaded the torrent three times to make sure and tried installing on various hard drives in my computer, all with more than enough space. I am installing from the image mounted with Daemon Tools. I have other Kontakt Products installed such as Kontakt Player 2 (A ""lite"" version for Garritan Personal Orchestra.) and Battery 3. If anyone could help out I would greatly appreciate. Thanks."
,therpandrus,2007-08-09T01:13Z,"It's soposed to be vista compatible... But who knows.. I'm running Windows XP Home Edition. Had no trouble with the installation. Installed everything including the soundessentials and even got some other vst plugins working toghether with the kontakt player, which makes this software really cool... I had sibelius 4 installed and it didn't conflict at all. Later I just uninstalled it because I could open and work with my older files with no problems at all. I thnk that most people is having problems the Sound Essentials installation. Irecommend not having any native Instruments installed just in case. Try removing it with Your Uninstaller 2006 or something like it to be sure the registry is clean. NI sofware is picky at times with this things."

,therpandrus,2007-08-13T22:26Z,"@carabelle69
A keygen is included in this torrent. As you can see. The number of files is 3. One of them is called Sibreg.exe That one you use to register the software.

@JohnnyDiamond
Sorry buddy I have no idea about that. I'm just learning here. Try Deamon Tools. It has always worked for me!!

I uploaded this 'cause I thought it might be helpful and I know most musicians don´t have the hundreds of dollars that is charged for this piece of software. Unfortunately I don't know very much about troubleshooting Windows errors. But I'm willing to help with anything I can think of that might be useful...

,therpandrus,2007-08-15T00:38Z,"As I posted before, Windows and Mac versions are on the DVD, unfortunately I only added a Windows keygen because is the only one I have. 
Let me tell you more. I think that there is currently no mac keygen for this version of Sibelius. I'm guessing so don't believe me. you might find one, but I think there isn´t because as a matter of fact there isn't an actual ""Sibelius 5 for Windows Keygen"" either. The one supplied in the torrent was actualy for the version 4 of Sibelius. But it also works!!!
-----------------------------------------------------

Thanks Sibelius Software!!!!"
,johnonz49,2007-08-15T05:25Z,"Installs fine on G4 and G5 Macs but you still need to run the keygen on a Win. Don't know about the new Intel Macs but shouldn't be a problem. The sound base install fine - just takes ages to transfer the 1.8GB file about halfway thru the install.
First time I've leeched for ages and using Azureus. Didn't check settings so was uploading at >200kbs while downloading at half that. Needless to say my 10Gb monthly account went in less than 24hr!! My thanx to therpandrus!
Also great to find a keygen that didn't appear to have a virus/trojan buried in it."
,johnonz49,2007-08-15T10:15Z,"Quoting ""I downloaded this file and copy to application folder. then I run Sibelius. but It doesn't work. I tried Sibelius 5 Demo. but It doesn't work, either
I use mac OS X 10.4.10"" and from the error report you are using an Intel based MacBook Pro.

I dont understand anything about crash reports so can't help but if the demo doesn't work either then there is an issue.
Sibelius is supposed to run on an Intel Mac. I can only think of 3 things. 1 - Did you log in as ""admin"" when you installed it and ran it the first time? 2 - Is there some fonts that may be clashing with the Sibelius ones. 3 - have you got some 3rd party plugin/library/whatever running that might clash? Sorry - am not a programmer/systems person - just a user."

,al_anuk,2007-09-22T19:42Z,"Hi everyone
Thanks for the great download, although I have had a few problems along the way the program works perfectly. I will outline the problems and solutions so that others can benefit from the download

1  you must first download the net frameworks program from the hybrid nero cd immage file

2  If you are like me and nothing is a registered copy then you will not be able to get windows installer 3.1 from their website. However you can get a copy from http://www.softwarepatch.com/windows/wininstallnt.html 

3  After loading sebelius 5 the keygen worked fine just follow the instructions carefully but remember to opt for the option I do not have any previous copies of sibelius on this computer

4  After installation sibelius ran fine so I installed sibelius sounds essentials which did not need the keygen. It loaded in ok but it takes about 10-15 minutes to load th two large essentials files, so just be patient because it looks as though it has crashed.

5  When it had finished I ran sibelius 5 again but in the configuration window, which you get by clicking ""play"" at the top of the screen then ""playback devices"" on the dropdown menu,it showed, ""default"", where it should have also given the option, ""sibelius sounds, essentials"", when you select this option the kontact 2 player appears in the active window.

I eventualy found that The reason for this problem was that this program requires you to have a ram memory of at least  1GB After increasing my memory size the sibelius sound essentials appeared in the configuration window and I had full use of kontakt player 2

Hope this is of some help

I've been a PC Sibelius user for as long as I can remember, but as I've recently made the dizzying jump to Mac (I warmly recommend it, by the way) I've had to download a version for OSX Tiger - thanks for putting it out there.
The install is fine and the program opens, runs and sounds great, but the registration doesn't work. 
I have the keygen running on my old PC, and it works fine. The Serial from the keygen gives me a computer number which in turn gives me a registration number for the registration. Cool. . . I do everything you said - try to register via telephone/fax/email etc, but it says the code is wrong. . .

,therpandrus,2008-01-29T00:39Z,"@sinlessdevotion
The file is a disc image. That is what you get when you copy a disc. You have to burn it to a dvd and then use that to install. Alternatively you can just mount it, that's the technical word. To do that you can use a software called deamon tools (get it at filehippo.com). It will mount the image in a virtual drive so your computer will assume that you have inserted the disc and you can install it that way. This is of course if you do not want to or do not have blank dvd's at hand.
Notice that Sibelius 5.1 is out now (already here in thepiratebay.org)
@guitmusic11, jepperas
follow the instructions from the keygen, i think i posted it as a comment on page 1

So it might be a mac related issue, but i don't know. I use a laptop pc and it has worked beautifully. I remember that someone posted instructions for mac as a comment on demonoid, you have to use a pc to run the keygen, for instance, or you can try wine, I think it runs on Mac OS X, but I don't really know about macs.

,Cybrazz,2008-04-20T15:30Z,"I installed everything successfully, but I have a problem with registration (particularly with the Serial Number).

My problem sounds different to what most people are describing, and I have googled and searched the Sibelius help centre but I still haven't resolved the problem:

After installing Sibelius (I'm running OSX Leopard), I opened it for the first time and a dialog came asking for the Serial Number. I entered a serial number that I had seen shared on a warez forum for the mac version. It then told me that this serial number is corrupted, and to contact tech support.

This happens now every time I load Sibelius - it doesn't give me a chance to change the number, just keeps coming up with the error and quitting again. I have tried reinstalling, and scouring my library and Sibelius package contents for a file that contains this dud serial number, but haven't found anything.

I didn't use the keygen because I'm currently in the process of acquiring a new HD to 're-bootcamp' and install windows again. But I will be using it once that's sorted.

Any help would be much appreciated - and thank you for the great upload!"
,StrychnineEye,2008-04-30T14:20Z,"Everyone having a problem registering, please read.

Ok, so I was having fun pushing s>enter, making serials... this messed up my registration number when it came time to enter the comp number.

To fix this, close and reboot the keygen.  Close and reboot sibelius.  In sibelius, go to help, then register.  Go back to the keygen, and type S>enter.  THIS WILL LET YOU ENTER THE SERIAL THAT THE PROGRAM HAS RECOGNIZED.  Copy character by character, spaces included.  The keygen will now say:

(keygen) entered

At this time, press c>enter and type in the computer number word for word as well.  I guarantee this is your correct registration number.

Go back to sibelius, and highlight the fax option as previously mentioned.  enter the registration number character by character, spaces included.  Make sure to capitalize the R for reassurance.

I hope that this works for everyone else.  I let out an OMFG louder than the N64 kid. :)"

,Podgebaa,2008-08-08T22:33Z,"AUDIO PROBLEMS::: READ HERE

FROM: http://www.sibelius.com/cgi-bin/helpcenter/search.pl?com=search&type=article&language=1&words=213&log=no

If you press Play in Sibelius and the vertical line follows the music, but you can't hear any sound, the most common cause is that you have not correctly set up MIDI playback.

First of all check that your computer speakers, MIDI keyboard or other playback equipment are plugged in, switched on and have the volume turned up.

On Windows:

Go to Start, Control Panel and double click Sounds and Audio Devices. Click the Audio tab at the top then click the Volume button. There, make sure the main Volume and MIDISynth/SWsynth are not muted and turned up.

On Mac:

Go to the Apple menu, System Preferences. Click Sound and then click on the Output tab. Make sure the Output volume is turned up and 'Mute' is unticked."

all you have to do is go
Start > All Programs > Accessories > Entertainment > Volume Control
There should be an option called SW Synth which will be turned right down if you have the problem
turn it up to full (or halfway, your choice), close this and the problem should be fixed!!
if not, try restarting sibelius and playing again"

,kclutchey,2008-11-18T21:57Z,"Thank you soooo much for this. I am on a new intel mac and I had no problem. I did have the issue initially where it wasn't saving my files (which I only discovered after working on a song for a couple of hours- it looks like it's saving when you tell it to, but the file isn't actually where you told it to save). 
I downloaded an upgrade from the Sibelius website- which means, on a mac that you have to reregister- it wants to use the same Serial number you initially used, but I somehow managed to talk it into creating a new Computer  number (honestly, I am not sure, I just tried a bunch of stuff) and then punched the old Serial and the new Computer numbers into sibreg and voila- a new Reg number that made it work- and I can now save.
For the who last posted- don't register over the internet- click by phone or fax. Then the program thinks you are typing in a reg number someone has given you over the phone and it will accept it."

It's not cheap! It's bad enough we download torrent files for ourselves but to share this precious bandwidth with the rest of the population and I have to pay for the extra, forget that! Not sure of other countries around the world but in Canada, there are limits and I am not prepared to shell out an extra $25-$150 per month to seed.
