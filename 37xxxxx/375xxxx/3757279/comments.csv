,ElricS,2007-07-30T19:03Z,"hehe yeah, but in her early days she was quite gorgeous ... sadly you cant get her early movies on the net ..."
,pawpaw.ro,2007-08-15T02:51Z,"someone for the love of GOD PLEASE SEED!!@! I AM STANDING WITH 0KB/S DL SPEED FOR 3 DAYS I ONLY GOT 2,7 GIGS OF IT"
,ElricS,2007-08-17T11:09Z,"I am seeding, and will do to 100 %. The strange thing is, the last 3 days i ve started azureus, got some connections and loaded up, but the next morning the tracker sees 0 connections."
,ElricS,2007-08-31T15:51Z,"Uhm, i am on the lower end of dsl speed possible (D-telecom ""dsl-light"") i can give about 10kb/s upload speed. 
This is my first torrent upload, and yes i should have tried a smaller one first :-)
I have done a mistake to set my dyndns adress as tracker, so i have to manualy delete it every time i start azureus. 
I have stopped all other torrents exepct one, and this file is on ""forced distribution"" / ""erzwungenes verteilen""
This runs smoothly now, and swarm progress is at 78 %, about 1 % per day.

The problem with 0 connections doesent appeared anymore.
I guess it was a tracker url conflict. I wish i could delete the useless tracker url once and for all, but for now i will delete it manualy every time i start azureus ..."

,ElricS,2007-09-13T17:00Z,"ok, its done :-)"
,ermac1983,2007-10-15T10:28Z,Can't unzip. Apparently its an unknown format.

open source compression  "
,desticado,2008-01-24T09:57Z,"Nice seed but why use this zip format?
in fact why use any zip format?
just seed the files so people can get what they want quicker and easier."
,avery 01,2008-01-25T16:42Z,"luv darla's stuff, thank you"
,zaphodbeb,2008-03-21T21:39Z,"Hi!
I can't get this to extract. I am using 7-zip and for all of the files I get the message that the file is corrupt. 
BTW, I have PN-6 that I copied from a VHS. Quality is barely adequate.
Zaph"
,H.A.L,2008-04-25T14:01Z,"Hi! I'm downloading this torrent and tried to open incomplete archives with 7-zip, but it says that "" can not open file ( the archives name )"" does it work, even winrar doesn't open files... Or should I wait until downloading is over...?"
,ElricS,2008-05-04T15:18Z,"Hi zaphodbeb, 
yeah it was a bad idea to 7zip my archive. I guess you have a download error. Many leechers were able to open the zip file. 
Do you like to seed the pn-6 files you have by time ?"
,lostscout,2008-08-20T00:44Z,"If your hard drive was formated ""FAT"" (like mine) the file system won't deal with single file larger than 4 gigs.  So watch it, you may be wasting your time."
,toastysausage,2009-01-06T22:56Z,"I'm using Vista and DL'd 7-Zip and it says that this is an invalid file. Thanks for trying though, keep it up! (no pun intended)"
,morrimoto,2010-10-27T05:30Z,seed harder dudes.
