,darien3,2008-08-06T06:38Z,"That's the problem with today's world, Charpays - rude fucking assholes like you who have no respect for anyone else. So what if he IS a ""newbie."" I've been on the 'net for almost 20 years, yet I am just getting into playing around with torrents just now. Why don't you fly out to Massachusetts and bark and snarl at me like that and see what it would get you?

Fuck you - and every pathetic online HATER like you. If you don't like his uploads, then STFU and skip over them. 

Just when you think you've seen it all, some new and improved fucktard comes along and opens his insulting mouth. Getting a chance to preview movies and all FOR FREE, yet bitching anyway - that's a beauty."

HOW DID YOU CAPTURE THIS?

I tried using a few screen capture apps .. CamStudio + a few others .. but the end result was very jerky.  What did you use?
