,ursak,2007-08-22T07:58Z,"Hey, if this version really works Im gonna kiss the ground u walk on :) Have an old v6 version cause the others after that always had som kind of prob.."
,Zoracic,2007-08-27T10:27Z,This definitely works but if you have problems try the slightly older 9.0.0.0 http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3716207 which I used for weeks with no problems
,ursak,2007-08-28T07:17Z,"Ok, this doesn't seem to work. :( 
After loading the certificate (wich says its good for two installs) it resets after 1 min to trial mode again. 

Maybe there is something I do wrong. Installing it and loading the certificate, anything else? "
,ursak,2007-08-28T07:19Z,"Hmmm... Thre sec after I wrote the last note I come to think of that maybe it did a small connect to the net, and thats why? But it didnt update anything."
,ursak,2007-08-28T07:30Z,"Hmmm... I actually can't find the alternative to connect to the internet in DOpus. I have turned off automatic updates, it already was turned of, but besides that. I can't really turn of internet every time I want to use this prog, right? So what else should I configure? "
,ursak,2007-08-28T07:35Z,"Hahaha.... Im so sorry for filling up this thread haha Never mind anything I wrote here. 

It did jump back to trial after I installed the certificate, but prob only until I restarted my pc or something for after checking every meny fรถr anything more concerning internt and updates I checked teh certificate again (was on my way to try it again) when I saw that irt really was registered correctly now. 

I'm truly sorry for all my fumbling here.

Thank you so extremely much for the best program ever. Ah... Used it since the Amiga :)"
,Zoracic,2007-08-28T10:39Z,Glad you like it :-)
,legion1978,2007-09-10T02:14Z,"thanx for this!
however,, it says certificate  invalid... so i applied universal patch but it crashes when checking for the certificate ..and it sometimes suddenly displays all file names as 8.3 ... by the way patch doesnt work with latest version (9.0.0.8) says d0pus is missing a component and should be reinstalled, shutting itself down"
,Zoracic,2007-09-10T11:44Z,"Patch? Version 9.008?

There is NO patch for this application. There was a patch for V8+ 

You have to use the valid certificate which works perfectly on 9.0.0.6."
,legion1978,2007-09-10T19:59Z,"uhh.. well mate, actually the certificate as i said above doesnt work for me (it says it is invalid code 2001D or something) 
so i tried patch (for v8+) in 9+ versions 9006,9008,9000 and it works in 9006 (with some annoyances), in 9000 (perfectly im using it right now) and not at all for 9008.
i just though id let you know this.. 
should i upload this 9000 version? since its not that easy to get  i think..
regards"
,Zoracic,2007-09-10T21:25Z,"V9.0.0.6 http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3716207

Both should be fine. Anyone else had a problem with 9.0.0.6? :-)"
,Zoracic,2007-09-10T21:29Z,"Certificates are normally OK but not if you use them on a newer version as D.O. kill that certificate when they release the update version. So this certificate is unlikely to work with 9.0.0.8.

And it's best not to let D.O. update either."
,legion1978,2007-09-11T04:01Z,"yes mate you got it right.  i installed 9006 in a clean machine and it worked flawlessly. thing is that in mine, i installed 9008 first, so it left its print there, invalidating the certificate (even though i uninstalled, reboot and stuff)

thanks for this great app. (though we now know patch works in 9000 ;) )"
,Zoracic,2007-09-11T06:11Z,"http://www.ccleaner.com/ should clean most files left behind and will a reinstall of older versions. Always works for me.

You can also go into your Program folder and Application folder to remove things manually."
,Zoracic,2007-09-17T15:28Z,Newer 9 9.0.0.9 http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3809760

,al_icky_bundy,2008-01-24T15:47Z,many thanx
,REPOM4N,2008-01-25T09:50Z,"Could it be that Microsoft's in on it?

Every DO I've tried so fare, failed the certificate.

I almost bought it but they charge more if you want to use it on 2 PCs. I have a KVM switch, so it's like one huge PC :)
That pisses me of. I?d definitely buy it if it wasn't for that."
,nok32,2008-01-27T07:26Z,seriously. the license is $$$.. i cant believe there is no working patch out for such a useful program!
,3TTE,2009-01-03T04:05Z,"newer and working
