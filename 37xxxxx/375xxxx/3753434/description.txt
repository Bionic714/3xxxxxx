How did ODB get to start hanging with the Wu-Tang Clan, anyway? The man goes so much his own way that not only does Nigga Please sound like no other solo project from a Clan member, it doesn't really resemble any record except itself. Funny, funky, and answering to absolutely no one, this is Big Baby Jesus' masterpiece. --Rickey Wright
