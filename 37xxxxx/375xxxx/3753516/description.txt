I just had to upload a collection of the best damn anime I've ever seen.

Nagareboshi is also known as Silver fang and Hopeanouli

The pack include:

Ginga: Nagareboshi Gin  (21 episodes)
Ginga: Densetsu Weed    (26 episodes) [OVA]
And the official sountrack to both of them!


It's all subbed by Anime suuxe-den (www.asd-fansubs.com).


I really hope you enjoy this! And remember to seed! ^^
