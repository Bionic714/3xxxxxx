if you use the original BitTorrent or uTorrent, in the bottom status bar of it, do you see a yellow ! or a green check mark? if it's yellow, your ports have not been opened corrently. if it's a green check mark, give it a few hours. torrents = snowball effect as far as speed goes. after an hour or so, with enough seeders, it should basically cap your download speed.

also, WinstonSmith6079, you = win. thanks =)"
