,aaroninoregon,2009-09-21T08:52Z,"It's a FAKE! It looks legit, but Eight minutes into the burn, a big, blank error window pops up, killing the app. That's when I noticed some German word on my Programs list. Under that, there's a ReadMe tab, which opens a document with a lot of German jibberish, and a poorly worded English phrase about ""stealing our downloads"". FUCKING NAZI! We should have killed them all when we had the chance."
