,hotratsalex,2007-09-25T15:23Z,"Xtorrent is a combo torrent/web browser with an interface exactly like iTunes. You don't even need to save .torrent files, it just opens them and starts downloading. 

So far so good, but this is the demo version - unless you stump up $24 there is a playing-card size nag window you can't close that tells you that after one hour your downloads will be capped at 10kbps, and half the torrents are marked 'Registered only'. There are dubious links to iTunes artists, it defaults to seeding until 1:1, no stats about availablitiy, seeds or peers.

There is a version on TPB that claims to be a crack, but even the author admits that search doesn't work, say no more...

 - in other words even if it were free the whole thing is a piece of contrived shit, the built-in web browser panes don't have any torrent function, and the iTunes-clone look just shows a complete lack of imagination. All together, expensive torrent access for those who can't hack uTorrent or Azureus and don't give a fuck about feedback or seeding.

But for me it's working, does not asks the activation code.
And about the search, all you have to do is go:
Go to preferences and on the search tap click on the ""+"" that's almost in the middle and tipe
