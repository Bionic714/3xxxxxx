  ..:: Synopsis ::..

The Andromeda Strain sets forth the story of -Project Wildfire- the crash mobilization of the nation's highest scientific and medical resources when an unnamed research satalite returns to earth mysteriously and leathaly contaminated. Four American scientists are summoned under conditions of total news blackout and utmost urgency to Wildfire's secret laboratory five stories  below the Nevada desert. There -surrounded by the most sophisticated computer equipment and sealed off from the outside world- they work against the threat of a world wide epidemic. Step by step they begin to unravel the mystery of the Andromeda Strain until, the seal on the lab ruptures and their already desperate search for a biomedical answer becomes a split-second race against time.
