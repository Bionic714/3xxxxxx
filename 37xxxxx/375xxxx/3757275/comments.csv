,logan993,2008-08-10T19:08Z,Hey guys.. Can someone please tell me how do I put this thing on cd/dvd??? 
,mikhail1234,2008-09-01T22:43Z,The easy way for you is to go and buy it for £3 on dvd
,jhdora,2009-03-24T10:02Z,"@mikhail1234

or.. you could do it the even easier way and download it for free!! 

save ya 3 $ in the long run. and stops the stupidly mass production of plastic discs that people tend to rip to their computers anyways."

If is £3 to buy I doubt theres much point burning it to a blank disc.

I find that the best way to watch these movies is via UPNP servers (such as tversity) streaming the movie via a LAN to a games console (wii, xbox and ps3 all support it)"
