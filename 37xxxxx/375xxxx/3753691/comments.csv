[V],Subzero!,2007-09-05T22:41Z,"another good game which has lack of seeder...

guess ' rip 'will be changed to (R-est I-n P-eace)gamename,torrent  means sooon something"
,asestar,2007-09-06T02:22Z,"Ok, lack of seeds aside, this rip is really bad. 

THERE IS NO MUSIC IN GAME! All the mp3 files in mp3 folder are empty blanks.. which blows.

Just grab the real cd-image from other torrent sites, its just 700mb anyway."
,asestar,2007-09-06T02:23Z,"Not just the music, all ambient sounds are missing along with lot of dialogs."
