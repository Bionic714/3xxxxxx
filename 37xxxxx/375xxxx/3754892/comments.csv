,mjukSbomull,2007-12-03T18:44Z,"Antar att eftersom spelet är svenskt att det är en svensk som som lagt upp det?

In aother way, jump :)

En fråga, varför i helvete kan man inte spara när man ändrar inställningarna i spelet? tex att man ska kunna välja vilken worms man vill eller hur mycket lådor det ska komma osv.. Varför kan man inte spara de ändringarna?

,rtstgtrst,2008-09-15T18:35Z,"ok, there's something wrong with this one.  i downloaded it and got a HUGE error.  it was the only thing i opened and ran so i KNOW it was this one.  as soon as it was done, i extracted it to my other hard drive.  opened the armageddon file that is used to run the program.  at first there were no noticable issues, then the game started acting up...screen froze and i exited the game.  suddenly, i had some new anti-virus installed and tried to close it.  tried opening my task manager and it was disabled, i could not get to my programs or anything.  everything had been blocked and could not be accessed at all.  i rebooted, then tried again.  turns out...i get the blue screen of death...motherfuckin virus...DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS SHIT...i've got to start all over now, you damn bastard..."
