This year?s ?Total? compilation features twenty-two Kompakt cuts. Watch out for the big Total 8 party in Cologne this August, too.

Like previous volumes, ?Total 8? presents the best of Kompakt over the last twelve months alongside twelve new cuts, including a taster from the forthcoming Michael Mayer vs. Superpitcher album (as Supermayer), and one track from reunited label bigwigs Jörg Burger and Wolfgang Voigt, ten years on from their Burger/Ink cuts in the nineties.

The ?Total? label comps are timed to coincide with the annual Kompakt bash at the C/o Pop Festival in Cologne. This year the five-day festival runs from Aug 15-19 with the Kompakt party falling on Friday the 17th. The party has a big lineup spanning two floors, with highlights including the first live performance in ten years from Burger/Voigt, sets from Michael Mayer and Superpitcher as well as guests such as The Field, Robert Babicz and Jennifer Cardini.
