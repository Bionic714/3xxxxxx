emotional reggae, swedish skapunkers Targetpoint have delivered their
musical mission since 1999.

Coming from smalltown Karlstad, with hard work and love of the music they
started touring Sweden, Great Britain and Ireland, gaining their reputation
as a brilliant live act. Two releases were made before the band decided to
take some time off to seek inspiration elsewhere. Members of the band lived
abroad and moved towns but pretty soon felt the urge to return home and do
what they love the most. Back in Sweden they spent almost a year back where
it all started, in the rehearsel writing music and defining their new sound.

After almost two years of scilence, Red Angel Records are proud to present
their debut album \"Songs of Love and Rebellion\". 13 songs of explosive skapunk to fan the flame of discontent. A dedication to the civil rights movements
of the 21st century. This is Targetpoint at a whole new level, heavy,
energetic and with melodies that will have you dancing and singing along to
the revolution in no time.
