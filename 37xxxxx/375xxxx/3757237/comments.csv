,tupid_wabbit,2007-07-30T05:07Z,Good Quality.
,rodggd220,2007-07-30T06:07Z,"yeah, isn't bad...could be better, but I am not complaining!

I hope people actually pay to go see it....its really worth it"
,Taboo Tongue,2007-07-30T07:40Z,Haven't watched the whole thing. But the audio quality is superb. The video quality still isn't the greatest. It's Warmer and Darker at the top and Cooler and Brighter on the bottom. Either way thanks to PUKKA and CiNTAX for working together.

fuck pukka i use to be in their scene 
they don't risk their ass!
think of it like a sorority they have the new recruits and you and the new recruits are the ones setting up the cams and mics (if needed) they promise you big money but i personally set up 6 big movies and sold the shit on the streets and underground for 4 months they said i was one of the best guys just a couple more releases well i did 4 more and sold tons with no problems  and again yah u are really good just a couple of more screeners. of course not  pukka's words but words passed down from the main guys. i eventually got out it was like a fucking gang they threaten your lives if you want to get out. i was getting $100 a month and brining in $25 000 grand at times and there is not a single thing that can lead this back to the main people. Word is one guy went to court but there was not enough evidence so nothing happened i had to flee the city. and these guys have tons of 10-18 year olds working for them  only a couple actually go in the theatres alot of em sell it. 
some info on scene groups 
you dont have to fucking thank them they make more money than drug dealers they are not in it for the scene and sharing they are in it for money and shit loads of it!!!!!

,Gomorrah_Sodom,2007-07-30T10:29Z,"If they were only doing it for the money, please explain how I am getting it right now?  I pay nothing but my internet bill, of which I am quite sure PUKKA gets none."
,LeoT,2007-07-30T16:41Z,"HAHA! In the intro: ""I will not illegally download this movie, I will not illegally download this movie""

Nice touch! ;)"
,Taboo Tongue,2007-07-30T19:37Z,"I agree with Gomorrah_Sodom. I don't know much about the scene true, but I'm not being charged by Pukka only my ISP."
,david1946,2007-07-31T05:11Z,"THANKS, great quality, almost DvD"
,marlicone,2007-07-31T10:38Z,"Swedish subtitle for this release @ MoTechSubs:

,sonof,2007-07-31T13:47Z,"Could someone please demux the audio from this and upload to rapidshare or like? I was stupid and downloaded the iND version and I can't hear the audio in it, only with VLC but then it crackles and sounds bad.

You can easily demux the audio using VirtualDubMod, open the video with VirtualDubMod, press Streams => Stream list => Demux and save as audio.mp3. Then please upload to somewhere and give me the link so I'll use this audio in the iND release instead.
I wouldn't ask for this but I have 256/256 internet connection now and it would take too many hours to download PUKKA instead now and we were planning on watching this film tonight :-/"
,ztereoid,2007-08-01T00:50Z,"Wonderful!! Pulled it in about 10 minutes, Averaged 1,0MB/s Thanx all og you seeders... I'll seed it for a day too!

Nice Quality too. 
Before you DL it... Go to the cinema first! Even better on the big screen!!!

,Taboo Tongue,2007-08-02T05:37Z,"ztereoid: ""I'll seed it for a day too!""
Do most of you only seed for a day? I keep a lot of my torrents on my computer and I seed until I delete the files (almost always with at least 1 to 1 share ratio). I still have my first torrent I downloaded and am proudly still keeping it strong. Only 5 seeds now there used to be 500+."
