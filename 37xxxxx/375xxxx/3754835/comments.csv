,Fendergirl,2008-12-24T12:24Z,This works just fine for me =D Thank you Hispa_no! Love it!
,Guv111,2009-03-01T19:45Z,There really are some thick idiots on here.  I'm hardly a computer whiz but it was pretty easy to install.  I suggest that those who don't know what they're doing either learn or piss off and BUY the game.  Either way -  stop bitching.
,d.rac,2009-04-20T06:42Z,can someone plzzzzz send me a crack link to mikesta_11@hotmail.com
,.BlackIce,2009-12-10T20:03Z,"To extract:

1. Go to the .rar where all the files are located, highlight them all and right click and click extract to a specific folder, make one on your desktop and extract them to there.

2. Go to your desktop folder where you extracted all the files, highlight them all, right click and click ""extract here"".

3. Once you do that, it should make ONE .iso file that you can use to mount then install. You still need a CD crack, which you can easily find by searching google for ""Rugby 08 No CD Crack"". Hope that helps for all you noobs. "

there is no install file there after extracting all the files..
not even in the VITALITY folder..
what should i do..??"
,Addictors,2011-04-09T13:15Z,thanks buddy took 7 hours to download 
,happytime10,2011-08-26T12:59Z,"Sup, 

If anyone is getting confused on what to do, once you download the file, use a .rar extractor and extract a file to the location of your choice. Then open up that file and at the very bottom there should be another .rar file. It ends with .rar. Again extract that file and you will get the iso file which you can mount using daemon tools :) then just follow rtorresuk's instructions, the cd key and crack he recommended and you should be sweet. Hope this helps :)"
