The album will feature collaboration and co-production with producers including Switch, Diplo, Timbaland, Bangladesh, and Danja,[3][4] as well as DJ Blaqstarr and Three 6 Mafia.[5] M.I.A. has cited the album as "shapes, colours, Africa, street, power, bitch, nu world, and brave."[6]
M.I.A. has been quoted as saying "[There was] a track I was working on with Three Six Mafia [that] didn?t make it?and one with Dangerhands, and Samir Debonair. Loads of things didn?t happen because I was having visa issues, but they?ll probably work out in the future.?[7]
Kala is named after M.I.A.'s mother (her previous album, Arular, was named after her father). M.I.A. stated that, "Arular...was a real masculine album." Regarding Kala, she says, "This one is about my mum and her struggle?how do you work, feed your children, nurture them and give them the power of information?"[8][9]
