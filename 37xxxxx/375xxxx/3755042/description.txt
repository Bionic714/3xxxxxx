PBS Nature - Kalahari, The Flooded Desert 2003 720p x264 AC3-SoS

General Info
Description: "NATURE's KALAHARI: THE FLOODED DESERT leads you to an oasis in the arid grasslands of Africa. Virtually all of the world's major rivers empty into the sea. The Okavango River in Africa is a notable exception: it empties into a desert. In doing so, it nourishes one of the most unusual ecosytems, in one of the harshest regions in the world.

The Okavango River originates in the highlands of Angola, flows southward through Namibia and then into the northern reaches of the Kalahari Desert in Botswana, where most of its waters simply evaporate in the wetlands of the Okavango Delta. Major wildlife players in the delta, besides elephants, include fish eagles, Nile crocodiles, lions, and the sitatunga antelope, whose splayed hooves make this creature especially well adapted to the wetlands. Discover the Okavango Delta and its richly diverse wildlife on NATURE's KALAHARI: THE FLOODED DESERT."
