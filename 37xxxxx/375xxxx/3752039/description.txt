Five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian-born doctor were held in captivity in Libya for more than eight years for allegedly contaminating children with the AIDS virus.  They were released on Tuesday 24 July 2007. The Kadhafi Foundation, run by Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi's son Seif al-Islam, said that about one million US dollars per infected child had been paid.
