,anisic,2007-07-30T18:16Z,"For the sake of the ""community"" can you please seed after you download the files. Thanks isic"
,anisic,2007-07-30T19:59Z,So far 10 people fully downloaded non of them seed. Sad
,i3novak,2007-08-01T14:11Z,"As far as i can see two ppl are seeding and I'm one of them. Ive been seeding this torrent since I downloaded it, so cut the whine.."
[T],Roys,2007-08-01T19:18Z,"I have to this moment seeded ratio 1 : 38,255 times...
I have uploaded 5.91 Gigabytes...

I do seed what is very interesting stuff and it's a pity that very few seed properly especially as it doesn't cost anything..."
[T],Roys,2007-08-03T15:33Z,"I have now seeded to a ratio of 1 : 56,786 (a total of 8,77 GigaBytes). I think that I now have done ""my share"" in sharing this one... ;-)
Now, it would be very interesting to hear how much all other have shared - especially the ""bigmouths""...
Probably its just the usual - everybody wants ALL and NOW!!! After they downloaded they are never heard of again ;-) Interesting to hear complaints mere minutes after the initial uploading and then never more ...
Bye my beloved leechers... ;-)"

I know i don't have the CD, since it's a torrent (DUH? :P), but i also can't them on google?"
