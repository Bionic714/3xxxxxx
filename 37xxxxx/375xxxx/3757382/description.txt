This version is based on a release of this file.

Paolini, Christopher - Inheritance 01,02 - Eragon and Eldest.lit

I converted it to doc, re-formatted everything. There shouldn't be any double paragraphs or double space in the whole document. Everthing is formatted using styles and can be change pretty quickly.

The documents seem to contain errors that occured during OCR.

Font used:

Bookman Old Style

I used a small margin to make the onscreen reading easier.
