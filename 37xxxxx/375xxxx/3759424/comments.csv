,Brickstin,2011-11-13T07:40Z,"There is no English Subtitles... Ive installed the fonts to, and checked Each subtitle folder to their prospective owners for each video and they only display Two files in each zip one being .uni_big5.ass, and another .uni_gb.ass.... They only display Japanese, Don't download this for now it's a waste of time.. I spent four days downloading this only to be disappointed with the end results.  :/ The quality is wonderful but you can't understand anything. GREAT IF YOU COULD READ JAPANESE. 


Appealarms.... can you please GET THE english subtitles.. .?"
