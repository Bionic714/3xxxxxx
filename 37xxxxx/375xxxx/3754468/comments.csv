Album review from an Amazon.com reader:
""The first review I ever read of this album (yes, this was back in the days of albums, 45s, and other extinct vinylsaurus species) described Julia's sound as ""a south-of-the-border Sade."" The sound may occasionally evoke the music of Sade, but there is no comparing the voices of Sade Adu and Julia Fordham. Sade's voice is the epitome of coolness, smoothness, and elegance. Julia Fordham's voice possesses some of these qualities, but she also adds an amazing range, with spine-tingling falsettos and rich, soul-fathoming lows. This is a completely confident and assured debut by a great singer. ""Happy Ever After,"" the first track, combines a profound sociopolitical statement (apartheid in South Africa) with an irresistable [sic] beat and a thrilling vocal. ""The Comfort of Strangers,"" the next song, is lively, upbeat, and completely catchy. The third and fourth tracks, ""Few Too Many"" and ""Invisible War"" respectively, slow the pace, adding a bit of sadness and the kind of world-weary wistfulness which fuels the later ""Porcelain"" CD. ""Invisible War"" is about the emotional barriers in relationships, and the piano and lyrics make it a very intimate performance. ""My Lover's Keeper"" begins with a dark, exotic beat, and then adds layers of electronics, brass touches, and powerful backing vocals. This piece is a good example of the sometimes-heavy Hugh Padgham production, which some people criticize a bit too strenuously. The sixth track, ""Cocooned,"" is quiet and sad and intensely personal, and is one of the strongest tracks on the CD. Her vocals are especially amazing on this track, spanning both high and low notes gloriously and effortlessly. ""Where Does the Time Go?"" is next, and is more upbeat and commercial-sounding. Despite the wistful lyrics, there is enough humour and rhythm to give the piece a lot of momentum. The eight track, ""Woman of the 80's,"" may seem a bit incongruous compared with the rest of the songs, and my deejay buddy Joe (whose opinion matters) feels the song hasn't aged well. I still like it, but I do find the production a bit intrusive and, well, just a bit 80's. ""The Other Woman"" is another dark, moody number, with yet another thrilling vocal performance. ""Behind Closed Doors"" has a very spare feel to it, and the anguish of being ""the invisible woman"" is documented: ""In this man's world I'm always screaming to be heard."" The high notes at the end are filled with trembling emotion, and the entire effect is extremely moving. The CD closes with the lively, beat-laden ""Unconditional Love."" The chorus is incantatory, almost like Julia and her background singers are chanting a mantra. Lest it get too preachy, too strident, there's a great, jazzy brass solo and a very energetic ending. There are only eleven tracks, and some of them are quite short (7 of them are under 4 minutes long, and 2 of these are under 3 minutes!), so it definately [sic] leaves you wanting more. Julia Fordham is one of those rare artists who needs only a few notes to establish a very special connection with her listener. From my first listening experience, I knew this relationship would last."""
