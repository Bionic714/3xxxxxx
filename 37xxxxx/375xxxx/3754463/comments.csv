,TurboTape13,2007-12-09T15:53Z,"Still a lot of us at 36,4%. Can anyone please seed???"
,menthal,2008-03-01T12:07Z,"Looks like the audio is badly out of sync. Main track used for both the intro and main content, perhaps? Anyone else seeing the same?"
,SnowflakeObsidian,2008-07-02T05:57Z,"The audio is out of sync by 196.2 seconds.  You can use Avidemux to extract the audio, and then use the Generate Silence feature of Audacity to add the required delay to the start of the audio.  Use Avidemux to combine the video with the new audio."

Thank You! (Könyörgök fiúk...)"
