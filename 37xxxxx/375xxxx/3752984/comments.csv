1st: It is in English and it has the crack with it.
2nd: no matter which AV you use, even if it says trojan, it is NOT!
in otha words... This upload is clean and has NO virus or trojan!

,Sparky9292,2009-01-22T23:48Z,"Thanks Christley! (heh after two and half years that this torrent has been up)

We just played this expansion on our lan party, so yes it works fine.

You will need a copy of the original game for this expansion to work.  It comes with a cracked exe that you drag and drop when done installing.

Thanks again!"
