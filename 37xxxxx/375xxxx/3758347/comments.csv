So download this, or my parrot will bite you."
,delightindisorder,2007-07-31T14:01Z,I've been looking for a copy of this for a long time.  Effing unicorn... Deckard was not a replicant.
,Stimorolchewinggum,2007-08-02T23:40Z,"Those who think that Deckard was a replicant, might find it interesting to read the book on which the movie was based. Although it's very different from the movie. The big question behind the story though, is the eternal question, of ""what makes us human?"".

And removing the narrative took something away from the great film-noir feel of the movie... The director's cut can burn in a very hot underground place..."
,Vansalty,2007-08-15T00:42Z,This copy looks like a VHS.
,darklittleapartmentstudio,2007-08-16T22:23Z,"The laser disc was copied from a vhs, because this version has still never been released to dvd. The only version that HAS been released to dvd in the U.S. is the directors cut. If you don't believe me, go look for it....    and rotsa ruck!

this is as clean as it was in the theatres, over twenty years ago, and the directors cut is crap.
If you don't like it, get bent :)"
,Ozwitch,2007-09-30T13:33Z,"ah, this takes me back a bit. Great torrent tks to orig. seeder, exc. copy, good aud/vid.

I like both this ver. and the DC, but this one lets you interpret Deckard more in your own way and doesn't force the whole hes-a-replicant thing on you like the DC does. Pity abt the corny end tho.

once again tks for the upload!!"
,darklittleapartmentstudio,2007-10-02T06:59Z,no sweat ;)

,darklittleapartmentstudio,2011-06-08T03:51Z,"Loganxart, thank you so very much. I too check back often to make sure there is still someone here. Always very nice to see that someone is.
Here's how it went down, i was there :
A fellow brought over his ""copy"" of Blade Runner one night, and i managed to sit still for about 17 minutes before becoming determined to show everyone what this movie was really about. The next day i went looking for it. ""Directors cut"" was everywhere, and apparently the original had actually gone out of print. Every later release was ""edited"" in some way- and therefore the original had seemingly already been lost. even the ""international cut"" is slightly different. we eventually ordered it out of canada, black market rip to laser disc (ripped from VHS, yes primative!), we were personally assured the goods were proper- and they were. so to answer that question, I am the original ripper, and uploader. 
We used an actual full size laser disc player- it was a giant pain in the ass, it took about 4 days and six tries to get it right. only laser disc i ever ripped.  ...and if i have to, I'll do it again.

And thank you all very much for what you do. Encrypt your traffic...

-and as always-

Up Evil, DarkLittleApartmentStudios"
,JayArgo,2011-07-30T16:06Z,"Thanks for sharing! Fuck Ridley Scott and his George Lucas esque ""Han Shoots First"" revisions. This is the version I saw on TV during 80s. Its actually the International Cut, judging by the description on IMDB. 

A=8, V=6. The video hasn't been modified to give a full widescreen image on 16:9 monitors and TV's. Its widescreen inside a tiny 4.3 frame. Unless you still have a 4.3 monitor or TV, try another torrent."
,serious_joker,2011-08-16T06:47Z,"I'm so glad to find this!  I never saw the original version, I came in with the Director's Cut.  Don't get me wrong, I quite like the Director's Cut and its' eerie silence.  However, I realize that I'm missing story, so I've always wanted to at least once HEAR Deckard's narration.

Thanks so much for you hard work!"
,logan-xart,2011-08-24T05:55Z,"yea the donkeys on the piratebay closed my account for talking trash to the fakers...

so if you need this film...Im still seeding...
"
,RickeeBoy,2011-10-11T16:00Z,"To Dark Little -

Thanks, brilliant that you managed to actually get this fine copy uploaded. Just to let you know ...... Ridley Scott got all DVD's siezed of the original copy and had the original destroyed because he got it in his head that the Harrison Ford Voice Over was shit - therefore you can't find a copy of the original as it's only on VHS. Thanks again Dark Little ..... to me .. I saw the original at the movies therefore it will only be the "" Correct "" copy.
Thanks again.
PS - Love the 2019 date in the movie !!!!!"
,RickeeBoy,2011-10-11T16:05Z,To Dark Little ....  Now if somebody was lift the Harrison Ford narration from your copy and mix it with a Blu Ray copy - then we might have something resembling the original but a Dirctors Cut with Harrison back in. ?????.
,BkkMarty,2011-11-18T13:34Z,Why the zip file?
,filevans,2012-01-17T23:17Z,"why can't people be clear with their labelling? 2 theatrical versions exist, the U.S. theatrical version and the International theatrical version

just writing 'theatrical version' is not completely clear which one, and there are big differences between these 2 versions"
,filevans,2012-01-20T00:43Z,"just downloaded this and it is not the original theatrical cut
darklittleapartmentstudio you are complete retard 

the original theatrical version is also known as the ""U.S. theatrical version""

whereas THIS torrent is the INTERNATIONAL Theatrical which was released after the U.S. version for the international market and contains some different scenes as well as some extra violence
"
,x30001wtm,2012-01-21T08:39Z,"filevans - a negative fucktard in any number of torrent comments.  Maybe darklittleapartmentstudio isn't from America.  Then to him, this would be the original.  Go find something in the shithouse behind your hovel to bitch about.

darklittleapartmentstudio, this is precisely the version I prefer out of all of them and I appreciate this torrent. Thanks."
,x30001wtm,2012-01-21T08:47Z,"JayArgo - ""Its widescreen inside a tiny 4.3 frame""

It's much simpler to say ""Letterboxed"".  It's normal for source materials that were produced before the advent of widescreen TVs.  The black bands at the top and bottom are ""burned in"", that is, they're part of the old style 4:3 image.  Full frame video contains the widescreen image between the black bands.  Normal... back then."
,x30001wtm,2012-01-21T08:50Z,"If I could change one thing...

Roy and Pris wouldn't kill J.F. Sebastian.

Discuss."
,filevans,2012-01-21T18:13Z,"x30001wtm - just because you prefer something means its ok to label something completely wrongly and confuse a lot of people and then they end up with a version they think they want when it isn't even it?

this is not the original theatrical version, and shouldn't be labeled that, this is the 'international cut', that was shown internationally in cinemas AND on vhs / betamax too, so it isnt even correct to say 'theatrical' 

not about being negative, about being ACCURATE

so x30001wtm, go to hell, you stupid little retard, you can't comprehend the differences so just leave it at that"
,filevans,2012-01-21T18:19Z,"x30001wtm here's some help for you here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versions_of_Blade_Runner

as you can see this torrent is NOT NOT NOT the original theatrical version, this just simply called ""the international cut""

so i simply want people to be aware of that so they can make an informed choice before they download it"
,logan-x-art,2012-04-13T02:12Z,"hey Dark, got my profile booted a few times...still sharing this bad boy...have been for years...

...still the best version out...fuck all the naysayers..."
,pedrovillarroel,2012-05-13T10:05Z,"This is what i was looking for!, @filevans, you are nothing more than an accurate retard troll, go bitching somewhere else.

Nobody cares about america, or american versions...

We are Europe, we are Sweden, america can just kiss my ass..."
,Carmoni,2012-06-07T10:18Z,"Thanks for the upload, but standard labeling should be observed. Or at least note that you are not observing it. This version is known as the ""international theatrical release"" in common usage. And by the way, what's with the zip file?"
