,gnbtnt,2007-07-27T13:39Z,"Video: 4
Audio: 3

We appreciate it, but the quality is iffy at best. "
,sgtwilko,2007-07-27T14:13Z,"this is the real deal , but the quality is extreamly poor, virtually unwatchable, but hey if u dont belive me go ahead and try"
,dertypunterderbruecke,2007-07-27T15:39Z,"this is the real movie! - but WORST QUALITY ever. the video is shaking all the time and one guy keeps laughing so loud that you can hardly hear the movie. my advice: wait for a better release or watch it in the cinema, but don't download this crap."
,Chemicalbeat,2007-07-27T15:45Z,"hehe looks really bad, but! If you wanna see it..
Iam gonna watch it today! Cinema, can´t wait to see it!"
,Spinnakerz,2007-07-27T15:49Z,"""audio 1/10 (a boy is laughing all the time)
video 2/10 (quality sux and it move all the tim)""

This has been filmed with mobile phone so what did you expected to see?"
,WeedIsLife,2007-07-27T15:53Z,its the real but useless to watch ....really bad bad cam version with a mobile cam with bad position and bad quality ......dont download if you planed to watch this shit......
,Brolle89,2007-07-27T16:44Z,"Dont download this shit, it's filmed whit a cellphone! LOL! 96x96 in resolution or something! haha"
,AnGrY_BaStArD,2007-07-27T17:20Z,"600k download
funny movie
shame about the cameraman moving and laughing into the mic but least its real

political propaganda at its funniest"
,hentooth,2007-07-27T18:35Z,"I think I'll wait for a better copy, thanks for the comments guys.. 

That BLEDIOD is being a pain thru the comments on various movies.. I'm reporting him to the site, he's trying to get everyone stirred up for no reason"
,cic,2007-07-27T18:38Z,"cheers! I'm of to see the premiere in a minute , but i'll dl this to reply some funnies when i get back

thanx"
,Dan7712,2007-07-27T19:06Z,I an downloading now seems as it is the only one in English ATM. I will tell you if it is watchable. 
,jennysalala,2007-07-27T19:26Z,I don't know about the rest of you but I think this movie should be watched in a theater. Simpsons is a great series and has been going since 1987 so I think I'll support all of them.
,cheapsk8,2007-07-27T20:07Z,"what the hell was that? this guy has terrets od add bouncing all over the place. 
thanks anyway"
,carl-emil,2007-07-27T20:10Z,LOL
,jessman619,2007-07-27T21:18Z,"As stated already, this IS the real 2007 Simpsons Movie. I didn't even watch the whole thing other than to verify its authenticity, as it seems to have been filmed by an individual who can't quite aim the camera right, and who seems to have made quite a bit of noise during the production.

I won't do as others have done, though, and insult him, because at least he made an effort to share this with the world, risking his own ass in the process. So thanks for the effort, but this is just a poor, POOR quality cam."
,ZeNiTH_NL,2007-07-27T21:33Z,"What jessman619 says!
thanks for the effort!"
,lbk4,2007-07-27T22:22Z,"Jessman is right. 
Quit insulting him.
How about instead of insulting him for the effort he put in, why don't you go to the theater andmake a nice recording yourself?
Ignoring that EVERYONE in my theater was laughing constantly, why don't you all go be ballsy enough to hold up your hq mini dv, or even better yet, portable HD cameras for us all? 

I don't even have the desire to download any cammed movie, but come on people, if you want better, go do it yourself. That's the idea of bitttorrent, isn't it?"
,SkurrePurre2,2007-07-27T22:34Z,"This one: 	The.Simpsons.Movie.2007.CZECH.CAM.XVID-Josef
Has better quality, but the sound sucks beacuse it's ""Czech.""

This copy sucks really hard beacuse it's camed with a cellphone camera... :(

But but, tomorrow has somebody fixed this movie with better picture and english sound....

Hate the countrys who dub their movies.. Start to learn english, suckers!"
,Ozcarzzon,2007-07-27T22:51Z,wtf why even tape this shit?
,Elfving,2007-07-27T23:08Z,Tanka inte såg den ikväll. Värd och köpa eller se på bio :D
,Dan7712,2007-07-27T23:54Z,"Ok - I watched the first few minutes of it.

I wasn't worth the download, but thanks LatinMovie for the upload. Others may like the Simpsons enough to watch the poor quality but I don't"
,jmmcriddick,2007-07-28T00:30Z,its a shit copy don't download it
,westerlund_13,2007-07-28T01:00Z,"DAMN u all who saw the movie should listen, They are damn beggin you to NOT upload the movie, and they really are worth to listen to.
u cant really experience this movie without watch it on a cinema.
We should show our respect for at least Matt Groening and co.

""Please do not download this movie"""
,glork2007,2007-07-28T05:08Z,Funny movie but VERY bad quality
,empreality,2007-07-28T08:49Z,"Don't worry, just wait until a quality release by Pukka, I have heard those people can afford this thing you hold in your hands....and delivers much better quality.....a camera..."
,david-b,2007-07-28T14:40Z,"that was the worst copy i have ever seen, i hate you and wish death on you, why not take a long walk off a short pier you complete smack tard, you are a pathetic excuse for a human being, i hope you suffer when it comes your time you vile piece of scum. have a nice day."
,SkurrePurre2,2007-07-28T15:00Z,"superj358, dumbass, this movie has just come to cinema... Wait some months, lol. :)"
,thejekel,2007-07-28T16:06Z,Haha nice cellphone bud.
,slaycon,2007-07-29T00:55Z,crap.  only made worse by butthead laughing at every stupid joke.  here is a clue: try not to make your laugh overpower what you are recording.
