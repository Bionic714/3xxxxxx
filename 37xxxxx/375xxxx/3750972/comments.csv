[T],Vazzt,2008-02-22T21:37Z,thats becouse many dont care about seeding
,stateofdreaming,2008-02-23T17:19Z,And some waste peoples time upping movies ripped with the most insane useless codecs that are bettered by others at 5gb in size. What the fuck is the point of the size of these if 5gb hddvd mkv files look better than this does?
