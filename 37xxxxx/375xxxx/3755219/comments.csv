,westerlund_13,2007-07-28T00:59Z,"DAMN u all who saw the movie should listen, They are damn beggin you to NOT upload the movie, and they really are worth to listen to.
u cant really experience this movie without watch it on a cinema.
We should show our respect for at least Matt Groening and co.

""Please do not download this movie"""
,jennysalala,2007-07-28T01:20Z,"For a show that gave us 20 fucking years of laughter, LISTEN TO westerlund_13 and watch the damn movie at theaters.... That is if you even have a life."
,jerrinot,2007-07-28T01:27Z,"Well, I've watched it in cinema, but I'm going to download it anyway. I'd even buy DVD, but there isn't."
,anindya,2007-07-28T02:19Z,"@westerlund_13, jennysalala

did someone pay you guys to post those comments? westerlund_13 copied and pasted the same comment he posted on another torrent. And jennysalala...well at least you are posting different sentences for different torrents. LOL! 

Oh and I would really like to go and watch it at a cinema, however its not releasing here till August 3rd. Also I don't know at which cinemas the movie is going to release. All I know is that it will release in August 3rd.

And I cant wait to see the movie..."
,jennysalala,2007-07-28T03:37Z,"@anindya: All I say is to support them. Buy cheap merchandise or anything. My saying is: If it's good enough to pirate, it's good enough to buy."
,WraithofAtlantis,2007-07-28T04:00Z,So is this is spanish or what
,Chimairo,2007-07-28T04:14Z,"I you guys/girls are so against piracy, what the hell are you doinf here?? ..at PIRATE BAY !?

,ginebradogone,2007-07-28T15:22Z,Bajo y seedeo
,billykid555,2007-07-28T15:42Z,"Im not downloading htis but, Im sick of you fuckwits complaining about that people should go see it in the cinema???
why the fuck would an animated film be good to see in the cinema? its a comedy it has nothing to do with aesthetics.  
funny that you all stand up and defend matt & co but never any other directors,... its not like they need the money! download it, its a free world."
,fmaack,2007-07-28T19:07Z,"Matt Groening is a multi-millionaire. I have no problem with stealing his crappy Simpsons movie that should have been made 15 years ago. And this  movie is released by FOX, even more reason to download it. This will probably be one of the highest grossing movies of the year. Download it and pirate it with PRIDE!"
,jennysalala,2007-07-28T21:57Z,"So why download it if it's crap. I never forced anyone but yield for people to go. In other word's, drop the subject and pirate like there's no tomorrow. 

Also, I never said I was against piracy. Check my upped torrents; not one is legal. "
,jennysalala,2007-07-29T01:11Z,FUCK YOU BITCH! I SAID DROP IT. FUCKING IDIOT!!!
,jennysalala,2007-07-29T01:55Z,SPAMMER. Someone get this spammer out of here.
,choiuno,2007-07-31T02:16Z,"No sabía que había grupos de CAM/TS /etc. en America Latina.

Es un CAM original o utilizaron el de algún otro grupo?

Como se llama el grupo que hace el release y en que página publican la info?"

That range of addresses belongs to MediaDefender, an anti-P2P organization, you and EVERYBODY should use some protection like PEERGUARDIAN or protowall to block them.
