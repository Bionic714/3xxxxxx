"
,hewhowalksalot,2007-07-30T13:21Z,"lol ah the amatuers.... they can bring a smile=)
course i am talking about the comment by sensi.

anyhow captain dopeman, you ever think about advertising, i mean a game like this i wouldn't  even consider but since you uploaded it i looked into it and it looks sweet. 

anyhow (just kidding about advertisement) i will dl and check it out and seed of course. 

thanks again captain dopeman the shit you be doing is doooopee!"
,sensimillia,2007-07-30T15:24Z,"amatuers? lol, the instructions where not rocketscience so they were quite easy to follow, but when extracting i get a bunch of error messages. i´ve downloaded this file twice, but still the same messages apear. since you´re the expert maybe you can tell me what i´m doing wrong? "
,majava2,2007-07-30T15:40Z,Anyone has ideas why my dl gets stuck at 64.6%?
,sensimillia,2007-07-30T16:09Z,"when extracting with latest winrar(370), i get 12 messages with ""corrupt file"". i´ve dowloaded 100% but my file is 1,14 GB (1 234 104 196 byte). never encountered this problem before, anyone know whats wrong?"
,420dopeman,2007-07-30T18:16Z,"If you're not using any form of IP Blocklist when downloading, most likely you are connecting to media defender bots., they hook up to torrents with different IP ranges and send to clients false, or corrupt data. This will easily cause errors and false completion reports in your BT client. This is a new means of defense for the infamous anti-p2p2 group and is causing problems for many torrents.
If you're stuck at a percentage, most likely you need to delete your download and start over.

,joker123456,2007-07-30T18:20Z,dopeman plz tell me will you bring us bioshock?
,420dopeman,2007-07-30T18:23Z,"and sensimillia, you've noted you downloaded:
1,14 GB (1 234 104 196 byte).

Look at the top of this page. The correct completion size should be: 
1.15 GiB (1234108141 Bytes) 
"
,sensimillia,2007-07-30T19:45Z,"i know the download sould be 1.15 GiB (1234108141 Bytes), thats why i wrote mine wasn´t. thanks dopeman for taking your time! and hewhoTalksalot, think before you speak next time..."
[T],Knaster,2007-07-30T22:24Z,"sensimillia don't  mind the idiots comments some people have issues they cant resolve normally thus spewing crap over others, dont mind em'!

Nice upload Dopey :)"
,sensimillia,2007-07-31T00:14Z,"thanks knaster. i understand on1n3, i´ll be more patient next time. all the best to the two of you..."
,Tacotits,2007-07-31T04:42Z,Dopeman you are a very talented individual but I believe the torrents.... should still stay shrouded for the ignorant... aka (images winrar nfo etc.etc.) Personally i dislike rip's they are missing files and or features i sometimes like.... and are usually difficult to update or patch.... and anyone can install them ANYONE............ =(
,gtr2,2007-07-31T07:24Z,"There are plenty of shrouded torrents for the ignorant. Keep up the awesome work and dont change anything. I never would have downloded this game at 4 gigabytes, thanks again for everything!"
,gtr2,2007-07-31T07:46Z,A lost planet extreme condition rip would be awesome. hint. thanks!!
,majava2,2007-07-31T09:27Z,"Every time I start to dl torrent, it says filesize is 1.1 GB in 3 files, when it should be 1.5 GB.

Any ideas?"
,mehmet6,2007-08-01T15:20Z,"Dopeman, we cant send PM's to u on piratebay so i have to write here. Hope ure seeing this. Can u rip Uefa champions League 06-07???

Anyway, hope youre hearing my voice. Its important for me, or my little brother, hes jelling at m. I reallly need this game Please"
,hewhowalksalot,2007-08-03T09:58Z,"sensi i apologize for any offense you may have taken, but in my defense there are counltess noobs (and sabatours) on this site who refuse to research the correct information on pirating and therefor leaving negative feedback or making ignorant comments.

many people rely on the feeback system and when some1 like captain dopeman here uploads something he doesn't deserve such feedback.

i admit i got a little jumpy but if you would have supplied the correct info on your problem first i would never had said anything.

dopeman that is very interesting piece of knowledge i never heard of. i assume blocklisting there ips is our only defense?????

thanks for the info
hewhoWalksalot
learning how to spell correctly does not make you uncool"
,sensimillia,2007-08-03T12:57Z,"no problem hewhowalksalot, we were both a little jumpy. you´re cool with me, all the best!"
,Svilkata,2007-08-04T10:43Z,"hey i wanna ask something..does this let you play the planet battles? and if not is the difference in size compared to the ""special edition"" all due to the sounds, music, animations and such?...anyway great game and thanks for uploading..."
,Supreme Scheme,2007-08-11T17:34Z,A Great game! thanx dopeman...

Help needed:- After I advance in the game I'm getting Load errors, i.e why I cant load my current saves. Can anyone explain?"
,ErrorFree,2008-03-07T20:48Z,It says files are corrupt when I try to unzip it. Total waste of time.
,rjiscool,2008-11-27T07:16Z,"This game really sucks, and you cant load worth crap"
,doodoob171,2009-01-04T20:21Z,"I wanted to try out a trainer with this game to get out of a few hard spots, but i cant seem to get it to work. I was wondering if anyone else tried using a trainer on this game and got it to work. It works with the retail version but im wondering if you did something DOPEMAN that maybe it doesnt work?

~Awesome torrent though, i love your work :D"
,putzpqp,2009-01-14T18:00Z,"download speed is at 0.6 kb/s
