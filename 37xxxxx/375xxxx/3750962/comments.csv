,Chitinid,2007-07-24T04:14Z,"It may be wise to strip out the metadata next time, unless you really want the publishers on you..."
,gobb1es,2007-07-24T04:52Z,"Chitinid,
didn't even notice that XD, thanks."
,Bamimi,2007-07-24T09:38Z,"ya support the book because heaven knows every publisher and writer needs multiple millions of dollars to just write like real writers do every day of the week for a lot less. People can stop buying their books now, they've been paid enough. and honestly, people may hate me for saying this, but honestly I was sorta disappointed. towards the middle/end of the book it sorta seemed like she just wanted to get the story over with honestly. I'm a fan of the series though"
,Neuroff,2007-07-24T09:50Z,One major error I noticed is that there are sections in chapter thirteen from the end of the book.
,gobb1es,2007-07-24T10:30Z,"Neuroff,
Could you please tell me which parts so I may fix it?"
,omarrom,2007-07-24T15:38Z,"not bad, if your going to re-release it can you add goto chapter links and dunno if you can, but can you add the chapter art as well. if you do that it will be really close to the book."

Harry dies, then returns from the dead and kills Voldemort, thats it, no reason to read the book!"
,fido_glc,2007-07-24T17:09Z,Hate to point this out to you gobb1es but in the contents you don't have page numbers.
,gobb1es,2007-07-24T22:44Z,"fido_glc,
Yeah, I know. I've finally begun reading the book, and am fixing any changes that I see while reading it. I plan to release a final version once I'm gone that should include the page numbers, but until then, they may change depending on any errors I may fix."
,Neuroff,2007-07-24T23:21Z,"on page 195,

The lift doors opened. They had reached the Atrium. Mr. Weasley gave Harry a scathing
look and swept from the lift. Harry stood there, shaken. He wished he was impersonating
somebody other than Runcorn. . .. The lift doors clanged shut.
The barman face was impassive. After a few moments he said, ""I'm sorry to hear it, I
liked that elf.""

the whole barman part shouldn't be there.

Also, 

He set off, his destination not the black door, but the doorway he remembered on the
left hand side, which opened onto the flight of stairs down to the court chambers. His mind
grappled with possibilities as he crept down them: He still had a couple of Decoy Detonators,
but perhaps it would be better to simply knock on the courtroom door, enter as Runcorn,
and ask for a quick word with Mafalda? Of course, he did not know whether Runcorn
was sufficiently important to get away with this, and even if he managed it, Hermione?s nonreappearance
might trigger a search before they were clear of the Ministry. . ..
""You're Aberforth,"" said Harry to the man's back.
Lost in thought, he did not immediately register the unnatural chill that was creeping
over him, as if he were descending into fog. It was becoming colder and colder with every
step he took; a cold that reached right down his throat and tore at his lungs. And then he felt
that stealing sense of despair, or hopelessness, filling him, expanding inside him. . ..
He neither confirmed or denied it, but bent to light the fire.
Dementors, he thought.
""How did you get this?"" Harry asked, walking across to Sirius's mirror, the twin of the
one he had broken

The whole part after You're Aberforth shouldn't be there.

I also noticed just about every time Ronald is written, there is no capitalization, and it is just ""ronald.""

I saw some minor mistakes but I haven't written them down."
,gobb1es,2007-07-25T00:57Z,"Neuroff,
Thanks for the reply. I'll fix any errors I see as I am reading the book, and fix the errors you mentioned."
,Neuroff,2007-07-25T02:05Z,"I've started typing errors as I read through the book, but it seems like it might take up too much space if I write them all here. If you want me to give you them, is there a better way of contacting you?"
