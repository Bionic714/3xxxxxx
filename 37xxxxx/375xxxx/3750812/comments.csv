COME ON GUYS!!!
Take the responsibility to seed Back!
I'll seed it again, but this is the last time!!!"
,melfice26,2007-08-14T09:57Z,"Okay, alive and kicking.
Keep it up!"
,melfice26,2007-09-29T22:32Z,"And yet again I'm seeding!!!
This is not the way this is supposed to work.
Come on people. If you're done leeching, seed till your ratio is correct 1:1
This way we all can enjoy the uploads of the users.
YOU DON'T SEE ME STOPPING A SEED UNTILL YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED THE WHOLE THING!!!"
,cosmos43,2008-09-03T16:48Z,Thanks for the up melfice26 but I cant complete it.Can you seed a little longer.I have a ratio of 1.7:.97.Im 3% away from finishing.Ive been downloading/seeding for 2 weeks everyday and night.I also see about 15 other people that are stuck at 96%.If you can get me to 100% I will make sure to seed and help the rest of them out.Thanks in advance.
