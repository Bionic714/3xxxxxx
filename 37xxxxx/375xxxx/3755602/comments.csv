,eternty40,2008-10-26T22:52Z,"Brilliant Torrent, works fine on Vista.
Just put files on a USB stick, (please remember in bios to set your PC first boot device to USB)
then just selected option 2 which took me to the passwords and just simply cleared them. 2 minute job, after tossing around for hours with other useless programmes. I am in your debt :)"
