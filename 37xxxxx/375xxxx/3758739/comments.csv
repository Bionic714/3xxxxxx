Bullshit. :( The writer has probably never heard of Estonians, Lithuanians, Latvians, Finns, Sami and numerous ethnic minority groups. There are still some pagan nations in Siberia."

,grainnuille,2008-06-07T23:59Z,"In the 19th cenury in Ireland, there was a witch in county Clare called Biddy Early - she never went to mass, and the priest was always denouncing her...he went up to the house to give out to her, and his horse wouldn't move, then when it did, it threw him in a ditch.  There were many of these witches etc at that time.  there are still families who buy warts and mind cursing stones etc.  
Also in the 19th century, both the catholic and the protestant churches in Ireland mounted huge drives to get people into mass - in some places like Donegal, mass attendance was as low as 30%...they got it up to nearly 98%!!! Scarey. but that was the underpinning that made Ireland so Catholic in the 20th century.
I'm just pointing out that there are pagan survivals everywhere, but I do believe that there were a lot more pagan communities in Ireland too, unconverted, just a couple of centuries ago.  They then had to go to mass etc to blend in and survive, and then were brainwashed and abused in the schools when the Cathjolic Church took over Ireland in the 40's.  Having control of the schools (and NUI Colleges etc) they rewrote the history to portray Ireland as always a catholic and 'holy' country.  but St. Brighid was reared by a Druid, and CSt. Columba met one as well
If you look into your own culture, you'll see many survivals etc.  
In Ireland, there's always been people who never go to mass, never got involved."
