,shmuckhead,2007-08-02T12:23Z,"Mr. Bosstha***,

I have never written a bad word about either TPB or FS200.info. Both have supplied me most generously with free downloads and I appreciate it. If others have problems with either TPB or FS200.ifo, that is up to them.

For my part, I will never understand why some people resort to endless swearing and insults in their posts in a flight simulation forum in the belief that it makes them look cool or gives them a sense of superiority. But if that is the depth of their intellectuality, so be it. 

If it makes you feel better, please, insult me at will, I'm happy to be of help. Have a nice day."
,BossThaNig,2007-08-03T01:16Z,"quit your bitchin you sound like a women!!

,shmuckhead,2007-08-03T02:19Z,"Well I do hope you feel better after that. If you wish to try again I am, or course, happy to be of assistance to you at any time.

Have a great day and enjoy the flying."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmuck

refers to the foreskin of the head of the a penis and has become common in American English meaning a detestable person, or a jerk. The word also means a stupid or idiotic person. In these senses, schmuck entered English as a borrowed word from the Yiddish slang for foreskin, (Yiddish: ?????, shmok), where it is an obscene term and an insult. In his famous cultural lexicon, The Joys of Yiddish, Leo Rosten lists the Yiddish schmuck as related to the Slovene word, ?mok, meaning ""a fool, an innocent, a gullible dolt."""
,shmuckhead,2007-08-04T04:18Z,"Now don't you feel better for writing that? And if you feel better than I'm glad and I feel better too. I'm really happy I could be there for you.
