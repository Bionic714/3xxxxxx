,hephnat,2007-08-07T15:49Z,"How do I use the .sub file ? It seems to contain only a lot of gibberish. Been unable to make a srt with VobSub from it.
Thanks for your help."
,rc71,2007-08-23T16:59Z,WTF!  Thanks man.  I didn't even know about this.  WOW!
,rc71,2007-08-24T15:14Z,"-- Warning --

This this is for hardcore B5 fans only.  Nothing really happens in the whole 90 minutes and only Captain Lockley and President Sheriden are even in it.  (Oh and a brief appearance by Galen)"
,DeltaPan,2007-11-24T19:29Z,"Don't listen to the above!

It is a very good addition to the B5 series and very enjoyable.

I upped this a couple of months ago when it first became available.

If people would have looked you'd have found it!

So what if the full cast is not present?

Why does that mean B5 fans need to be warned?

You sir, are an idiot for trying to disuade people from enjoying this 2 episode continuance of B5!"
,DeltaPan,2007-11-24T19:34Z,"My mistake, sorry, this was upped first.

Doh."
