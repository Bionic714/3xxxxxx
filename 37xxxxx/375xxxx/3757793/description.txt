Bill McKibben on DEEP ECONOMY
A talk and conversation with Michael Pollan
Bill McKibben?s book: ?The End of Nature? is regarded as the first book for a general audience about climate change. Published in 1989, it has been printed in more than 20 languages.  He has since written on localization, alternative energy, and the risks associated with human genetic engineering. In his most recent book: ?Deep Economy: The Wealth of Communities and the Durable Future? he envisions a transition to local-scale enterprise.

McKibben and his family live in Vermont. He is a scholar in residence at Middlebury College where he launched the campaign: stepitup2007, demanding that global warming pollution be cut 80 percent by 2050. McKibben spoke in Berkeley in March 2007. The church was filled to capacity with an enthusiastic crowd. He was joined on stage by a colleague and fellow author, Michael Pollan, author of ?The Omnivore's Dilemma?, and ?Botany of Desire?.
