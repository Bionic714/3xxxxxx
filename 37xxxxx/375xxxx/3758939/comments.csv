,ABHORRANCE,2007-08-09T07:57Z,"I'm liking it about the same as I did Gutter Phenomenon. The vocals are way better, but the song-writing and recording quality are dumbed-down. A 7/10 or 8/10.

The rip would have sounded better if it were Joint Stereo rather than straight Stereo. It sounds close to 128, and not so much like 192."
