Boy, we really live in a screwed up world when people don't even have respect for religion, even if they don't believe. Btw, you are fulfilling a biblical prophecy by making your sacrilegious comment. The Bible says people would scoff and mock God just before Jesus returns to destroy unrepentant sinners and sin. One day you'll remember your words, but it'll be too late for you then. Laugh and mock now. The Bible also says, ""Be not deceived, God is not mocked. For whatsoever a man sows, that shall he also reap."""
