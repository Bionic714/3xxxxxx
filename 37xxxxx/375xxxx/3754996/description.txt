For all you TMNT loving turtles...here are the three original movies:

"TMNT 1: The Movie"---at a length of 1 hour and 31 minutes, it is presented in a full screen aspect ratio of 4:3 with dimensions of 512 x 384 and an audio running at 117 kbps

"TMNT 2: Secret of the Ooze"--- at a length of 1 hour and 25 minutes, it is presented in a wide screen aspect ratio of 1.85:1 with dimensions of 672 x 368 and an audio running at 116 kbps

"TMNT 3"---at a length of 1 hour and 32 minutes, it is presented in a wide screen aspect ratio of 1.85:1 with dimensions of 608 x 336 and an audio running at 118 kbps

I've separated the three films so you can download just one, all three, or any combination of the three. 

To my Swedish pirates, I apologize for my inability of finding subtitles in your language.

After you have finished downloading, please be courteous by seeding to an upload ratio of at least 1; in other words...

SEED...SEED...SEED...SEED...SEED...SEED...SEED...SEED...SEED...SEED...SEED...SEED

Thank you and enjoy the movies!
