Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law

  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0294097/

"Once a third-rate superhero, Harvey Birdman is now a third-rate lawyer trying like hell to get by in a fancy law firm. It's not clear whether Harvey actually went to law school, but he definately knows the things to say to sound like a lawyer. And he has a suit now, that's for sure."

I've ripped all three DVDs and included the commentaries as second (and in one case, third) audio tracks on the episodes in bold. This is really a great series that didn't get the attention it needed. Please support the show and creators by buying the DVDs if you already haven't.
