,dirtlos,2007-11-26T04:02Z,great download but why not include the episodes with and without commentaries? 
,terios,2007-11-27T00:23Z,"Learn to change which audio track you're listening to, dumbshit."
,dirtlos,2007-11-29T12:51Z,"hey, thanks cocksucker"
,PaiSan,2007-12-20T01:09Z,Thanks dude!!
,wiggle46,2008-02-28T16:48Z,thanks but why no subtitles
,xx79xx,2008-03-24T12:31Z,can we get more seeders? saw this the other night at a mate's house and it is fucking hilarious!
,_paddy_,2008-04-04T19:41Z,"Great torrent. I can't get the sound to work on any media player I use, and have downloaded all the latest codecs. If I burn them to DVD, will the sound work or does the codec have to be on the computer before burning? Could you suggest a codec for me to use? Thanks."
,_paddy_,2008-04-04T19:54Z,"Nevermind, I got it sorted. Thanks again for the torrent, great show!"
,smguy,2008-04-09T21:43Z,Hey. I finally finished the download then learned that the videos either don't play or only have audio on all of the media players I try. Can someone help please?
,smguy,2008-04-09T22:27Z,nevermind. I got it figured out too. Great torrent.
,shabroky,2008-05-09T07:29Z,Thanks a bunch!
,Ghettogreen,2008-05-14T08:09Z,"The audio codec is a52, which needs to be downloaded to watch this on Quicktime."
,waspleg,2008-09-12T01:18Z,"these are all fucked up and broken, I just tried to watch the first 11 episodes, almost all of them won't load, I have every codec, all current versions installed.  for example, the first episode will play the audio all the way through uninterrupted but the video is all fucked up throughout, properties show xvid 640x480 format with ac3 audio; I have brand new versions of both.  I deleted the ones I have to try the other big torrent and stopped seeding this piece of shit.  I am using xvid/ac3/quicktime alternative w/ current version of media player classic; windows media player won't load anything and gives its classic DRM error (""unknown"")."
,hoRUS_,2009-01-08T23:44Z,Where can I download English subtitles? Does anyone know?
,Ferneu,2009-01-10T21:40Z,Whoa! I've been looking for this for a while. Thanks! And thanks again for the commentary tracks!

,terios,2009-02-22T07:34Z,"I'm bitter? Haha! You're welcome, asshole."

,ceilfisk,2010-07-26T04:21Z,Thanks for the UL terios! Awesome quality.

,jcrboy,2011-06-13T22:11Z,"Thanks for this! As a fan of the show, I appreciate your work."
,Kintrex,2011-08-24T11:17Z,A whole bunch of these episodes have two audio tracks but when I switch between them they're both the show without commentary. Does anyone else have this problem?
,2_Wycked,2011-10-14T01:16Z,"Awesome quality for the episodes; can someone just explain to me how to get rid of the commentary? do I have to use a program, or is their some simple option I'm missing in Windows Media Player?"
,terios,2012-01-30T01:51Z,"2_Wycked, ""Windows Media Player"" doesn't handle multiple audio tracks well. Try using a media player like ""Media Player Classic"" or ""VLC Player."""
