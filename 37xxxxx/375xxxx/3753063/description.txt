All in one CompTIA A+ Certification Exam Guide - 6th Edition DVD

This is a great book. Mike Meyers is a great author. There is an ebook uploaded which was great one day when I left my book at work and needed to study. Here is the CD with video training that goes along with it.

Buy the book! it is a great desk reference.
