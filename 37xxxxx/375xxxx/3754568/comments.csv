,ChronicKiller,2007-07-31T14:43Z,Seed please i was going fast but all the seeders dropped out on me.
,SiberianCitizen,2007-08-01T19:30Z,"Ok, after I downloaded I got 2 rar files and a serial. I extracted the rar files, got 2 folders. In folder one, there are 2 files, an MDS and an MDF file. In folder 2, there are 4 files, a CCD, SUB, CUE, and IMG. I tried to mount these with PowerISO, but it didn't work. Can someone help me?"
,SiberianCitizen,2007-08-01T22:04Z,"Ok, I figured that out, was using the wrong thing on PowerISO. However, the images still don't work, whenever you mount the MDS it will still keep asking for the ""play disk""."

,AJMcDAniel,2007-08-03T22:33Z,"And SiberianCitizen, Have you tried using Daemon Tools? It's really good with this sort of thing."
,AJMcDAniel,2007-08-04T03:16Z,"Actually, nevermind. At about 60 percent downloaded, it completely stopped. In the beginning, it was going 100 - 200 kb/s, then it stopped.
I is sad."

,hello kitty,2007-08-18T03:54Z,"like some of the other people here, my DL was blazing at somewhere between 200-300 kps, then capped at about 58%, seems there arent any seeders. interesting to note is that included in this DL is a torrent for the same game (as a .rar) at mininova. that one seems to have full availability, but doesnt DL as fast. 70 kps is still good though!"
