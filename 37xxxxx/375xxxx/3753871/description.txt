ItÃ?ï¿½Ã?Â¢Ã?Â¯Ã?Â¿Ã?Â½Ã?Â¯Ã?Â¿Ã?Â½s the beginning of the holiday, but New York City Detective McClane isnÃ?ï¿½Ã?Â¢Ã?Â¯Ã?Â¿Ã?Â½Ã?Â¯Ã?Â¿Ã?Â½t celebrating. HeÃ?ï¿½Ã?Â¢Ã?Â¯Ã?Â¿Ã?Â½Ã?Â¯Ã?Â¿Ã?Â½s had yet another argument with his college-age daughter Lucy, and received a crushingly routine assignment to bring in a young hacker, Matt Farrell, for questioning by the FBI. But for McClane, the ordinary has a habit of exploding into the extraordinary - abruptly hurtling him into the wrong place at the wrong time.
