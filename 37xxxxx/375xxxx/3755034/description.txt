\'Revolution In Me\' is the debut album from ex-Sugababe Siobhan Donaghy. Produced by Cameron McVey (Massive Attack/NenehCherry) and Donaghy herself, the album aims for a more contemporary adult pop/rock sound than that of the Sugababes. The singles \'Overrated\' and \'Twist Of Fate\' are also featured.

The original CD was copy-protected and I couldn\'t play it. I finally managed to MP3 it, so I\'m uploading to others who bought in good faith and got shafted.
