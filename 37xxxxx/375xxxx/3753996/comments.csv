Thanks for uploading :D

vinc117... as it says. If you do not have Starcraft and a CD-key, you will need to find a non-legit key to try the game. This game is not a Warez game, but instead a image of the original. Therefore it does not have any cracks or keys with it."

If you have a clean install of Leopard your out.  There is also no way to add Classic to Leopard other than dual booting.  May help settle some of the problems....

,zhou.fei.fei,2008-03-12T00:39Z,"INSTRUCTIONS:

NOTE: this game works perfectly on a Hackintosh Leopard 10.5.2 install (hp dv6245ca laptop):

1. Load all three .dmgs inside the bt'd folder.
2. Run the installer inside 'Starcraft OS X Installer.dmg'.
3. Install the Brood War Expansion pack (it includes the original game, so there's no point installing the original game ONLY).
4. When requested, using either a legit Brood Wars cdkey or the following: 3174-40788-0368.
5. After the game finishes installing, run 'Starcraft' alias to start the game.

ENJOY :)"

You open the torrent and double click on the Starcraft.dmg and Starcraft-broodwar.dmg and it mounts them automatically. You then open the installer and install, and just enter any Name, and one of the CD keys in the comments below. I had it and it would close past the opening screen, but to fix it i went on the starcraft website and downloaded a patch and followed the instructions for the patch. It should then work.

The problem that I was having was when I tried to play, the ""start up options"" came up and when I clicked ""ok"" the window would close and nothing would happen after that. All you have to do to fix this problem is follow this link http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?articleId=21149 and download the Macintosh version 1.16 Upgrade Patch for either starcraft or broodwar, whichever you wish to play. Then unzip the file and open ""how to install"", which will walk you through the steps. I hope this helps everyone who was having the same problem as I.
