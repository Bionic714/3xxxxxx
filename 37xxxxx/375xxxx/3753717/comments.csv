,hsophie,2007-08-31T06:38Z,"It doesn't work. The filenames are messed up so the installer doesn't install properly, eg. Instead of longfilename.cab you'll find longfi~0.cab

I found this out after 2 days of continuous downloading....  What a waste of time...:("

i had no problems installing it, but it doesnt want to run (""issues with version of windows"")...
what can i do"
,Ubehage,2007-11-10T15:26Z,"maps_5>

According to Microsoft, Visual Studio 98, 2002, 2003 and 2005 is NOT supported on Vista.

Visual Studio 2005 can be ran by installing the update named ""Visual Studio 2005 Update for Windows Vista"", and after rebooting, install any new updates for Vista and Visual Studio.

Visual Basic 6, and Visual Studio 2005 (with some updates) are somewhat supported in Vista.
I will upload Visual Studio 2008, as soon as I get it.."

,dikcoop,2008-02-20T22:27Z,"when I attempt to install, it fails during the .NET framework installation.  I think it has something to do with my computer because I downloaded a separate torrent from MyBittorrent and got the same error message.  Can anybody help?"

,simplyh4x,2008-04-10T02:11Z,"I'm seeding all i have (35%) at unlimited speed (180 kbps) and all the other pricks have it set to 1%. Don't be a faggot and seed the fucking file everyone with like 70% and above, this is ridiculous im connected to 50 seeds getting 27 kbps..."
,kevindub,2008-05-14T05:41Z,some one do me a favour and seed
,dialate,2008-06-07T04:35Z,"FYI: Corruption errors are very common when you're trying to install MS developer tools off of daemon tools or whatever. Just extract the whole ISO to a folder and run install from there, then it works great.

2005 doesn't handle Vista well. For everything, right click and ""Install as Administrator"" Get SP1 and then Vista compatability patch.

It will still give a warning, but just alter your shortcut properties to always run as admin, and then click the ignore warning checkbox when it comes up"

,roges,2010-04-18T19:16Z,"Thank you. I tried to extract the ISO so I could just install from a USB drive but part way through it demanded a CD. I burnt the ICO (imgburn) and it worked perfectly.
(I was able to compile C++)
{The fact the Thunderbird started to crash and no longer works on that computer, running Vista, is less important to me - oh and the wireless stopped working once I had installed and rebooted, but a windows update seemed to fix that.)"
,takeasied,2010-10-11T18:13Z,"don,t complain about seeding and first buy a fast PC or take a good provider i got glass fiber  120MB and what first took me a week i download now in 60min so first take a look at what you got  "
