,dashisQ,2007-12-27T14:22Z,Please seed this torrent.
,Nomiss009,2008-01-02T14:55Z,"I'll be seeding this a lot for a week or two now, not 24/7 though."
,HellSaber,2008-02-11T14:22Z,"Wow, Thanks! This is a hard to find series! I've been trying to find DVDs of this to Sub as well, When can we expect the last 10 episodes? :)"
,Nomiss009,2008-02-12T20:54Z,"Well, I have all (50) of the 1979 episodes, but no subtitles and I don't know Japanese. So unless we can find a translator I don't think it's worth uploading 'em. :P"
,HellSaber,2008-02-13T03:53Z,"Hey, Nomiss009, email me @ destroyah@walla.com so we can talk about Subbing ;-) "
,animefreak_,2008-03-12T17:23Z,Please seed :)
,Nomiss009,2008-07-27T18:51Z,"I'm currently working on improving the quality of these episodes, since the original DVDs suck (which is pretty embarrassing, since they're supposed to be ""digitally remastered"" and were uber expensive). I'm pretty happy with the results so far, so I won't be seeding this torrent anymore. When I'm done (gonna take a LOOOONG time), I'll upload all 50 of 'em."
,Nomiss009,2008-07-27T18:52Z,Can't promise any subs though. :(
