Updated decoders 
Repacked with UPX 3.00w LZMA 

As Gambit's official (free) program is nearly 2 years old, the decoders were very out of date and in this updated release you get the latest versions. The installer just copies the files over and adds a destop link, without messing about with the registry. Everything is contained within the program directory and to uninstall you just delete the program's directory - no files left all over your Windows installation. It's small and fast, not at all bloated like many burning applications. 

Absolutely no malware, spyware, trojans etc and 100% clean.

various audio files.
