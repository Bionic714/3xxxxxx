Hi everyone:
Well this is my first upload here:)
My all-time favourite TV show:))))) Starring Jeremy \\\"Cupid\\\" Piven & Paula Marshall:)))))))
I know the series is already shared here, but I know my copy of it has much better quality.
I captured myself the whole series 3 years ago, with a Pinnacle DV500 DVD capture board, straight from the DirecTV signal. Quality is awesome, HOWEVER, all the episodes (this one included) has non-removable spanish subtitles (latin-american).
Being this one my first upload, I kindly ask you to come back once you finished downloading it and let me know if I should keep on uploading the other 14 episodes. Thank you very much:))))))
One more thing: I have a very slow upload speed. If you want to see all the episodes posted here, please be kind and help me seed them. Thanks:)))))
Enjoy:)))))

Take a look at its quality:
