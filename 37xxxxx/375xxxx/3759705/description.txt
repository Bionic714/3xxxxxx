On a day that starts like any other, a boyÃ¢??s life is changed forever. As the main character and his friend Miki pass a leisurely afternoon, Miki suddenly collapses from an unknown illness. When the girl shows no sign of waking, the main character grows distraught over not being a better friend and not having the means to save her. 

Suddenly, a strange voice offers him a second chance: \"Beyond the door you can change your destiny!\" He soon leaves the real world and journeys to the world of Vision, where, as a novice \"Traveler\", he will surmount myriad ordeals in hopes of ultimately meeting with the Goddess of Fortune to have a single wish granted.
