Labrador Summer Sampler 2007

Well, putting the massive 68-track Labrador Summer Sampler 2007 on our server didn't work quite as smoothly as we'd hoped. I don't know if we overestimated our server or underestimated the need of good music this summer. Either way, our server has been pretty dysfunctional ever since but it's all been taken care of now. Very sorry about this!
