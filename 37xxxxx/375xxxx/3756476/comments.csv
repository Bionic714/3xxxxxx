could you play a downloaded xbox game?
"
,Yautja,2007-09-07T03:10Z,The other way around. The program emulates a pc on the xbox. I.e. you can play old dos games on a modded xbox.

,Lark_Prof,2007-11-07T06:15Z,Either this an emulator made for emulating the PC engine game system on your modded xbox console or its an emulator for DOS or x86 which is meant to run on the xbox. It is NOT a PC emulator that runs xbox games. Your all about about 3 - 5 years too early on that one. And you can run xbox games on your PC anyway without an emulator. It's called downloading the PC version of the game you want. Because I am pretty sure that 80% of the games that were released on xbox have been ported to PC
,Lark_Prof,2007-11-07T06:19Z,After looking at the torrent it's defiantly a PC Engine(TurboGrafx-16) emulator with a bunch of roms that is meant to run on a modded xbox.
