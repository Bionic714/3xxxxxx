,Tidor,2008-03-22T11:40Z,"This works fine, but you can't install any patches(this version is 1407), some mods, or Apocalypse Weekend, for example.

To do this you'll need to add the following to your registry(either manually or make a .reg) :



[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Running With Scissors\Postal2STP]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Running With Scissors\Postal2STP\Full]
""MpUpgrade""=""1407""
""Country""=""US""
""Version""=""1407""
""InstallDir""=""D:\\Games\\Postal 2""
""Launch""=""D:\\Games\\Postal 2\\System\\Postal2.exe""

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Running With Scissors\Postal2STP\Full\US]
""Launch""=""D:\\Games\\Postal 2\\System\\Postal2.exe""
""InstallDir""=""D:\\Games\\Postal 2""
""Version""=dword:0000057f



NOTE: You will have to change the path if it differs from mine(D:\Games\Postal 2).


Patch to 1409 at http://www.postalnetwork.org/files/file.shtml?ID=242

It took me a bit to figure this out so I thought I'd share. Hope it helps someone."
