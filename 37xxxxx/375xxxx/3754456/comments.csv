,chillz469,2008-03-31T06:00Z,"thanks for the torrent and ziping it man
these retards obviously dont understand the reson why you would zip something"
,wildcat.nl,2008-04-02T19:44Z,zipping doesn't make it much smaller and lots of people don't want all the songs.. It would be better if it was unzipped :)

,Kevone07,2008-12-30T08:36Z,"Sum 41 rocks and thanks for uploading it and putting your time into it. You Rule!!!! The only problem is that you put the quality rate at 128kbps. That sucks, but thanks anyway. "
,schmitty84,2009-07-30T15:00Z,"Chillz, you are obviously the fucking retard. Rar or zip is good only if there are a lot of files or if it takes up enormous amounts of space. 5 cd's are hardly justifiable. However, it is free and it doesn't take but maybe a minute to un-rar. In fact you can get programs like 7zip for free. So quit complaing about something that takes so little time to do. You could just go buy the cd if you wouldn't like it rar'd."
,schmitty84,2009-07-30T15:02Z,"Also, it's zip. Not rar."
,lions7,2009-11-24T06:52Z,"Thank youuu, good torrent"
,Yeyikeo,2010-01-25T04:31Z,"Did you really NEED to zip it all together? Personally, I find the ability to select portions of a torrent nice, rather than download everything offered, even if I don't want it"
,sssSlay,2010-03-16T18:15Z,Thanks. great quality.

if you dont like certain songs....well you had fingers to come on here and type in the band and use the mouse to DL it. So use those fingers and mouse to delete songs you dont like. And let us all enjoy it. :D"
