In 1944, in the post-Civil War in Spain, rebels still fight in the mountains against the fascist troops. The young and imaginative Ofelia travels with her pregnant and sick mother Carmen Vidal to the country to meet and live with her stepfather, the sadistic and cruel Captain Vidal, in an old mill. During the night, Ofelia meets a fairy and together they go to a pit in the center of a maze where they meet a faun that tells that she is a princess from a kingdom in the underground. He also tells that her father is waiting for her, but she needs to accomplish three gruesome, tough and dangerous assignments first. Meanwhile, she becomes friend of the servant Mercedes, who is the sister of one of the rebels and actually is giving support to the group. In a dark, harsh and violent world, Ofelia lives her magical world trying to survive her tasks and sees her father and king again.

Alright. Let\'s have some Q and A:

Q: Section 8, why are your mp4 releases so large? :(

A: I can spell it out real simply. They are of very high quality. They have not been resized and shrunk to a horizontal resolution of 640 like many releases. They retain their original horizontal resolution of 720. If you compare these releases to the original DVD material I think you will be hard pressed to notice a difference. The difference is transparent to the human eye. I encode my movies to be the same quality as the original material when viewed on my 92 inch HD screen.
