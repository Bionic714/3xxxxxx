,ender6,2007-08-25T15:49Z,Seeder needed please... Thanks in advance.
,Zwergenpaladin,2007-09-26T12:45Z,"More Seeders, please!
I'm trying to complete this for days :("
,tdatb,2007-10-24T07:12Z,"This page may show a seed but there hasn't been one present in the swarm for several days, now. I'm currently stalled at 49.9%. Every once in awhile I'll connect to someone who is at 72+% but he/she never shares any of that data. I would really appreciate it if the seeder could get back in the pool and open up their bandwidth until at least a couple of us complete the torrent. 
"
,Pyatin,2007-12-22T00:44Z,"Yes, a seeder (preferably the original) would be nice.  Personally, I leave the torrents at 2-5kbs when I originate and they aren't to heavily used.  If I see a DL on it, I'll bump it up.  

Hint: If you don't feel like seeding what you originated.....remove the torrent when nobody else is seeding it. ;)"
