High resolution textures for Oblivion.  "Homepage" here:

I had a huge struggle downloading it from the designated mirrors (fileplanet tat and a rapidshare mirror) so here's a torrent upload to help everyone out.

The directory in the torrent is the contents of the zipfile download on the gamespy page linked above.  The .exe is a self-extracting 7zip archive.

Despite comments in various places saying it needs a 512MB+ graphics card, it works fine on my 8800GTS 320MB.
