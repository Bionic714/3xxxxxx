What a nice boost to the graphics in Oblivion.

,Triplehammer,2007-07-25T00:54Z,"sam3000: I previously tried this on my brother-in-law's 8800GTS 320MB but it couldn't quite do it.  I watched the texture memory useage using the console tdt readouts, and it uses more than 320MB.  When Oblivion uses more texture memory than your video card has, you take a big hit on FPS.

256MB or 128MB cards definitely will NOT be able to handle it.

That being said, it is the most awesome mod for any game I've ever seen.

Be sure to get the 1.3 update for QTP3 here:

It's only 10meg and fixes a couple of issues.  More info here:

,sam3000,2007-07-25T01:27Z,"Hi Triplehammer,

That's very interesting because I've seen others say the same thing on forums.  But I swear it works fine for me :-).  perhaps roughly a 5 fps drop.  I normally get anywhere between 30-70 fps outdoors depending on where I am.

I'll check tdt on my setup to see what it says.."
,sam3000,2007-07-25T01:57Z,texture mem usage peaks around 250MB for me (this is during running around outside).  This is at 1280x1024 on 64 bit vista running drivers 158.45 and now 163.11.  and I'm definitely running the high res pack!
,krimzon27,2007-07-25T08:19Z,"I should of got the 640 8800 gts =( oh well, sli time =). BTW any of you know if I can get the 640 mb version and it sli with the 320? only difference would be the video memory."
,Triplehammer,2007-07-26T00:51Z,"When you have two cards in SLI, you only have the video memory of one.  That means two 8800GTS 320MB in SLI will still only have 320MB of texture memory, so that is not a very good card to run in SLI.

Right now, the only cards that make sense to run in SLI are the 8800GTS 640MB and the 8800GTX, and you only need to do that if you want to do something ridiculous like run 2560x1600 with 2x AA.

The 8800GTS 320MB, 8800GTS 640MB and 8800GTX as single cards just destroy anything else you might run in SLI or Crossfire, in both price and performance.

You did fine with the 320MB, it's a monster card for a mainstream price.  Nearly the only place it's iffy is on whether or not it will run this 900 pound gorilla of a mod."
,Prof_Oak,2007-07-26T13:56Z,Is there another place where I can download QTP3 patch ? Or if any1 wouldnt mind on torrent it here pls ^^

,YYZed,2007-12-31T10:59Z,"More seeders would be appreciated please.  I tried THREE times to download from stupid Fileplanet and they all failed with less than 10MB to go (99% done), what a waste of bandwith (over 5GB).  This is the only source I can find for now unless someone has a working server source."
