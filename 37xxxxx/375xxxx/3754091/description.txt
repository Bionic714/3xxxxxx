I'm seeding this because a lot of people have been having trouble patching/installing the new client.

The ZIP file contains Global MapleStory Client Version 0.40

It is the same client that I am using, so it should work for you unless you have a problem with your computer.

Just unzip it and copy the contents to C:\Nexon

Please be considerate to your fellow Maplers and seed the torrent when you are done downloading.  You can still play the game while using bittorrent.

Enjoy - bokuwaomar
