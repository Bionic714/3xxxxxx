,Averex8,2009-03-04T17:40Z,Why do people keep calling mezzo forte a hentai? Its hardly hentai. There are only 2 sex scenes and 2 nudity scenes throughout the whole thing which make up a small percentage of mezzo. I suggest you all check out the anime series too and not just watch the 2 ova's soly because there's sex in them.

Personally I'm here for the porn, couldn't care less about the anime, though it is pretty good."
