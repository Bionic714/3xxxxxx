,007ace,2007-07-30T22:44Z,"what program are you using egge_n? 
Ive got 2 separate computers seeding each with a different set of peers... its been really slow, but now I can see 3 seeders online, so it should speed up now.
Are you able to download other torrents or is this your first one?"

 thx for trying to help"
,007ace,2007-07-31T03:10Z,"hmm... are you getting any error messages? or is it just stalled?
Ive heard bitlord can be buggy, are you able to try uTorrent or Azureus, Ive used both those with no troubles."
,007ace,2007-07-31T03:18Z,"oh and heres the screen shot again, different host so itll last longer... sorry im kinda independent on the torrent scene

,rhinos2000,2007-08-02T05:27Z,"How do you open all these RAR files? I get a fromat error every time!
MAc OS X , like non-idiots use. thanks!"
,007ace,2007-08-02T18:00Z,"Hmm... I dont normally use Mac, but have you tried using http://www.unrarx.com/ it seems to have some decent properties. you also might want to try google, cause im sure someone else knows what you should be doing."
,firefoxx81,2007-08-02T18:09Z,"Download the StuffIt Expander, works for me..."

please tell me im just a beginne at these torrent stuff...."
,007ace,2007-08-03T02:29Z,"yep, you extract the ISO from the rar files using winrar, then you burn it to a dvd r using whatever program you want, say, nero.
pop it in ur dvd player and your good to go."
,sufinger,2007-08-03T06:02Z,"Hey man, Thanks for the movie.. Awesome ass quality for a bootleg..  Well worth the wait on the download"
,m7F4Y3,2007-08-03T21:52Z,"I'm downloading it now, I post a comment later and rate this later."
,xmikiexdk,2007-08-06T23:12Z,yes it has been a long ass time and am wondering why is it so slow i have a great connection just its so slow downloading i cant belive it.and i need seeding plz people seed for my sakes so any answers to that?
,xmikiexdk,2007-08-07T09:42Z,So wat if i have utorrent then it automaticlly extracts the files to make it into a dvd file then i just burn the file onto a dvd r disk then pop it into a dvd player and thats all or wat do i do?
,xmikiexdk,2007-08-07T22:13Z,i have downloaded the simpsons movie its at 100 and done but how do i get it off utorrent and get it on the dvd-r disk plz respond to my question i need answers plz.
,xmikiexdk,2007-08-07T22:46Z,ace where are u ok plz run me by this step by step plz like how do u extract the iso from the rar files plz help?
,007ace,2007-08-07T22:56Z,"OK what I use is a program called winrar.
you can get it from RARlabs.
you install that and open the first file its 
simpsons movie.part01.rar
then inside that archive (its 1 spread over many files for security) you extract everything thats in there to its own folder. then you just burn it to a dvd, most people use nero, but it doesnt really matter what. If u are using roxio you have to ""copy"" a dvd, and point it to the folders.
sorry for any confusion... i know next time ill make an ISO"
,xmikiexdk,2007-08-07T23:16Z,what website is the rarlabs at? and how do i open the winrar?and do i have to download the simpsons movie again or no?
,xmikiexdk,2007-08-07T23:29Z,ace i downloaded the winrar then found the simpons movie in downloads and then opened the simpsons movie.part01.rar but all it shows is audio_ts and video_ts wat do i do now?
,xmikiexdk,2007-08-08T01:31Z,wat do i do now?
,xmikiexdk,2007-08-08T03:35Z,wat do i do now do i have to have a certein program to write the file to the disk because when i tryed to write it from the my computer thing it says put in a cd-rw disk so wat do i do?
,007ace,2007-08-08T05:23Z,"OK you need a DVD-R to burn it to DVD.
which means you need a DVD-R drive. And like i said in my previous post, use NERO or Roxio to burn the DVD Video Folder.
if you just want to watch it on your computer however, you can extract all the files in the video_ts folder, and open the big VOB files in Media player. They are MPEG video files just over a Gig in size. play one after the other to get the movie."
,xmikiexdk,2007-08-08T05:58Z,wait is nero a dvd drive thing or wat?because i dont have a dvdr drive is there any other way?
,007ace,2007-08-08T18:03Z,"nero is a disc burning utility, try searching for it on google.
and since this is a DVD and states DVD in its titile, and in every post ive given you yes you need a DVD burner, unless like i said previously, you watch it on your computer, the only thing you can do is burn it onto a DVD."
,STEFanGB,2007-08-10T23:05Z,"007ace Your patience is endless, respect man!! (((:"
,007ace,2007-08-11T08:21Z,"np, we all gotta start somewhere...
all praise google 
all knowing power of the internet 

;)"
,AmericanLoser,2007-08-27T18:03Z,"When I tried to burn it using Nero I had to keep each section seperate, it would not combine them to make a full length movie per say.  I am burning now.  Hope all goes well.  I will post after viewing."
,AmericanLoser,2007-08-27T18:59Z,"Just press play all and they will play as one movie.  Vid 8/10 audio 9/10.  The video does skip a little, but not bad at all."
,007ace,2007-08-28T09:35Z,"Ya sorry about the confusion with the menu there... My DVD player doesnt like to seek unless there are chapters set up, so i always put them into my DVDs just to make skipping easier. 

Glad this torrent is still making its rounds."
