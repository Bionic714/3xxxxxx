,PirateCollector,2008-07-13T11:36Z,"I had the same problem(only problem) when I had the game, thats where the cheat code leanest comes to play. HeHeHe

captainelliotspencer What is meant my seeding? I am new to this kind of stuff & I don't know how to seed. If you can explain me that I will seed this game for sure, cause I like it."
,PirateCollector,2008-07-13T11:40Z,So rating is called seeding. I did seed the game. Happy Now!!
,PirateCollector,2008-07-13T11:56Z,"One more thing, You have never read spider man comics right? cause, the members of the sinister six are Doc. Oct(head), Electro, Mysterio, Sandman,  kraven & Vulture. Not these guys For more info check this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinister_Six"
,PirateCollector,2008-07-14T16:05Z,"All right, downloaded it, played it. Surprisingly no interruption, I was able to catch venom. But I got one little problem. What happened to the cool moves that spidy makes. I was never able to climb on the enemies back &  punch their head nor was I able to hold 'em from behind & kick their butt. Is this an old version of the same game?"
,mx16m,2008-08-10T06:07Z,"actually there are several variations of the sinister six, thats not the only one. thanks for the upload!"
,xqwK36,2008-09-09T13:02Z,"How do you mount or burn the spiderman.img i dont know how to do it help please!!!!

and do you also have metal gear 1 for the PC"
,vibhash,2008-11-21T22:24Z,hey if you have started playing this game it will stop at scorpian's meeting so don't be worry. Go to 'special' 'cheats' and type LEANEST now go to 'level select' and choose any level except that.
,saint4life,2009-02-03T13:57Z,"Hey Captainlliotsoencer 

I just downloaded the game today , it finished , wheni open it  all i see is a clown picture  ( Nice) and a spiderman folder , I open that , and i see 3 files :I what do i do now??"
,saint4life,2009-02-03T16:45Z,How do u burn this to a cd and how do u install it please help me please please please !!!!
,RedAlert7,2009-03-02T06:08Z,"WTF. this game smoothyl besides a few glitches here and there (game freezing crashing or repeating cutscenes) but it was playable on-the less. For me, it looked like somone MODDED the game. There were signatures in plces saying stuff like "" was here"", except with somones name. On the Dock-Ock Boss Battle there were flower powers symbosl and smiley faces every and  a picture of somones head saying ""Dr. LOve. Also sound affect were changed as well. In the carnage fight (right after the Dock Ock fight) carnage made baby noises. Was kinda funny though, a baby's voice saying ""DIEDIEDIE"" or ""Bet'cha didnt see THAT comig...""

Though, iwas kinda afraid either had a virus (cause of the liberal modding)or that the clown picture was gunna pop up in the middle of the game. (lol). Ia lso dont remember quick-spidey or bagman or sub-mariner as avaible costumes in the original game (i owned it).

Seriously, captainlliotspencer, if you are the one who modded teh game, reupload without the mods. its kinda annoying and takes away from the experience.

Also, i couldn't do moves like jump on peoples back and such  as well. This does seem like a more unrefined version of the game).

OVERALL SCORE 2.5/5
Pros: Playable
        Only Minor glitches
Cons: very unprofessional 
          Inappropriate, and unnecessary modding
          frequent glitches
          Game Play Features missing or  inconsistent."

""please insert spider-man Cd-rom, select OK and restart the game"".


solution :

1. download daemon tools.
2. u will have its icon on the right hand side of
    the task bar.right - click on it.
3. go to virtual devices option.select one of the
    devices and click on mount image.
4. browse and go to the folder where u have    
    spiderman.ccd file(it is one of the three files u 
    extracted from rar)
5. double click on the file and u wil be able to 
    play the game then."
,SpideyFan,2010-01-19T10:08Z,dgkresge the iso file will be where u extracted it.
