Folk Pagan Metal

Finsterforst may not (yet) be playing truly epic metal on the scale of, say, Moonsorrow, or being quite as accessible as Equilibrium, but in my opinion they`ve nicely carved out a niche of their own here. Since bands such as Wolfchant also are enjoying fair amounts of success, it`s perfectly possible that some of my complaints in this review are to blame on my peculiar tastes. As such, I simply recommend that fans of pagan/folk metal give this album a listen; I don`t think you`ll be disappointed.
