,poppopoppopoppo,2008-12-03T16:48Z,"Working fine, thank you tobis 986 :). The size also very good thing, butt then there is no the advisor or wondet movies. :( Luckily i can download the full version from here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3838674/Civilization_II_Multiplayer_Gold_Edition :) This torrent is good if you want to get the game fast or when you computer is full, 700 Mib is pretty much.
