,rebeudyr,2007-07-29T05:06Z,"VLC plays it well, try that."
[V],greenbud1969,2008-05-27T13:18Z,These movie is in  MP4 format if you wondering. It wont work in your dvd player unless it has MP4

This played just nice for me. I played on DivX Codec installed Jetaudio. If everything fails VCL media player play it for you. 

Full movie down to the last second.
Had a such a great download speed (75% of my bandwidth). make sure to pre install DivX Codec to avoid any frustrations.

Great Movie"

[V],greenbud1969,2010-04-04T06:22Z,I meant to say to play in a standalone divx player the file must be in MP3 format.
