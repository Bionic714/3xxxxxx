,derekdee007,2008-03-27T05:49Z,Thank you for upping this in lossless.  The nature of these CDs I think requires it.
,pcsdcs,2008-07-01T05:39Z,this works perfectly. thanks for uploading...keep seeding all
,alvinacres4848,2008-07-24T05:43Z,"Actually, the nature of binaural beats doesn't require flac/lossless because of the simplicity of the tones that are recorded. The beats are caused by the brain hearing 2 or more simple tones that are slightly different in each ear. Although I would prefer a 256 to 320 kbps recording, I'm sure that as long as you kept good channel separations, a basic 128kpbs recording would work as well as lossless and save us all a bunch of time and bandwidth. When I started getting into these recordings recently, I couldn't imagine why they were being posted as flac files. Maybe I'll post my collection at a lower bitrate with my explanation for those of us who just can't wait to try the next BB file they find."
,mauifrog,2008-10-29T04:21Z,"Finally, we are often asked if digital compression
technologies degrade the quality of the Hemi-Sync速
tones or their ability to support expanded states of
awareness. The answer is no. Our Hemi-Sync速 signals
are laboratory tested before they are released into
commercial recordings. After several research studies,
we have concluded that compression methods that
emulate ?CD quality? or better will preserve the
integrity of the Hemi-Sync速 signals.We do not,
however, recommend compressing our audio below
CD-quality (128kbs), nor do we recommend
compressing an already compressed audio file (such as
the exercises in this series)."
,cosmicjazzer,2009-01-25T11:20Z,"Thanks for this. However I've noticed that everything is running slightly faster in these files than than in versions I have from another (mp3) torrent of same course. eg. wave 4, adventure 3 is about 41min in mp3 version but 33min here. I've also verifed that the pitch is higher. Just wondering if there's something that needs to be set in FLAC decoder to sort this..."
,cosmicjazzer,2009-01-26T07:17Z,"I'm still having the problem of these files playing too fast. It's not by much by the way but it's definitely noticeable. I'm wondering if there is some sort of sample rate discrepency somewhere... Any ideas? 

Another thought: Has anyone got a legit (ie. purchased!) CD from this course. If so, could you tell me the exact length (in minutes and seconds) of one of the exercises. I could then alter speed of the files appropriately (in Cubase)..."
,cosmicjazzer,2009-01-26T07:58Z,I've now done a few more comparisons between the mp3 files I have (from a different torrent) and these. In most cases the speed IS identical. The discrepencies are in some of wave 4.  Will report back if I find any more...

,ahso,2009-10-31T06:16Z,"Yes, the nature of binaural beats may not require flac lossless encoding but it *does* require proper encoding. 

For example, if you listen to the very first audio file in the distribution, it gives instructions about headphone orientation. And it indicates that you should be hearing the speaker's voice only in the right ear, and if not, reverse the headphones.

With this version of the CD, these instructions correctly occur in the right ear. In other non-flac versions (MP3) the instructions occur in both ears. As such, the CD's will not be effective in these other versions."
,ahso,2009-11-02T01:43Z,"Ah, just realized something. When downloading these and playing them in the OS X Finder I got left/right stereo separation as required. But when I imported them into iTunes there wasn't any more left/right stereo separation.

I discovered that you have to make sure that you have the Sound Enhancer preference turned off in iTunes. Then it plays the files correctly with left/right stereo separation."
,tee_m,2009-11-24T15:12Z,"alvinacres4848 Try cleaning your ears sometimes and you might understand someday the difference between mp3 and flac. :) i dont say that this would need to be high quality, but it is idiotic to rip a sound that someone has made to be what it is. if you have a bandwind proplem get your self a better connection."
,viciousbee,2010-02-17T18:34Z,"Thank You!!! this is great to have this collection and it's in FLAC!!! I love Hemi-Sync and this is a prize to have the whole Gateway Experience  collection in this format, I can't wait to continue my exploration of Consciousness. Thanks again, Bless you. Love and Light. "
,sidders_2,2011-03-01T20:47Z,"Great share, cheers :)"
,birdie87,2011-12-30T03:43Z,"I just downloaded this, eager to use it. 

I can't get complete stereo separation in both ears. My headphone are fairly decent. played in vlc media player straight from the downloaded file. any idea's what i am doing wrong???"
,birdie87,2011-12-30T03:44Z,"just to add, it is a bit louder in the right ear as it should be when he talks at the beginning. just not separate"
,Oriknet,2012-03-12T11:55Z,"easyrider, could you please let me know how to convert these FLAC files into mp3 so that I can listem to them over my ipod? Thanks"
,bdefalco,2012-03-19T19:17Z,I tried to download this with uTorrent and it says that the size of the download is 0 gb.  Any idea why it's not working?
,[PoD],2012-03-22T02:47Z,"bdefalco, this happens because you are using the magnet link. Try downloading the torrent instead.

,best_collections,2012-04-16T14:37Z,"Can you all comment on the results (or lack thereof) you may have had with this series? 

Did listening to this series help you achieve what they are purported to help you with? 

(I'm simply curious and ask without malice)."
,jrussev,2012-07-26T18:05Z,"Hi all,
I'll be very thankful if someone seeds this torrent. I'm trying from more then a week to download it, without any success. "
