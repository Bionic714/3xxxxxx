Methadonia

For more than 30 years, methadone has been used to treat heroin addiction. But when mixed with other substances, such as benzodiazopenes, the treatment can be as harmful as the heroin itself. METHADONIA exposes the problems of treating heroin addiction with legal methadone.

METHADONIA is the borderland between high and straight, where recovering heroin addicts on methadone "maintenance" exist. Passing the time on benzos and other prescription drugs that enhance the methadone, addicts find themselves in Methadonia for years, or decades. Selected for the prestigious New York Film Festival and featured on HBO, this unflinching, intimate film reveals the culture of addiction through the eyes and lives of men and women stuck in Methadonia, holding on to the hope they will wake up one morning and not think about getting high.
Black Tar Heroin 
An extraordinary look at two years in the lives of five young heroin addicts, Black Tar Heroin offers a rare and intimate portrait of how heroin devastates young lives. The film chronicles the daily lives of Jake, Jessica, Tracey, Oreo and Alice, three young women and two young men, ages 18 to 25, as they face the ever-present perils of hard core drug addiction--crime, prostitution, rape, incarceration, AIDS, overdoses and death.
The film shows the brutality and degradation of the drug life, but also depicts the addicts pain and raw yearning -- to get clean, to hold relationships together, to re-connect with their families, to get their lives back.
Academy Award-winning filmmaker Steven Okazaki, with associate producer and sound recordist Jason Cohen, spent more than two years in San Francisco's drug underworld, recording the stories of the city's young addicts. Using mostly hand-held camerawork, often working without electricity -- lighting with camping lanterns, flashlights and candles -- they unflinchingly capture the harsh realities as well as the human side of the addicts' desperate world.

Facing the habit

Can a root that grows in West Africa successfully treat heroin addicts and break the cycle of addiction? Ibogaine is a derivative of the West African root Iboga; its properties have recently been reported as an effective treatment for drug addiction. Dave is a former stockbroker whose life has spiraled out of control due to heroin addiction. A one-time millionaire, he is now reduced to petty theft as a means to supply his habit. Traditional treatments have failed to work for Dave for over a decade. Desperate to get help, Dave decides to travel out of the country for the Ibogaine treatment. Facing the Habit is an intimate look into the struggle of addiction, as Dave\'s life is revealed before, during, and after the treatment.

It also shows the importance of effective aftercare and motivated minds to stay healthy in the long run.

Ibogaine the rite of passage

The truth about a criminalized treatment for addiction

IbogaineIbogaine is a substance derived from the root of the African plant Tabernanthe iboga, which grows in Gabon. This sacred plant was originally used during spiritual initiation ceremonies of the Bwiti religion. In 1962 the anti-addictive properties of ibogaine were discovered by Howard Lotsof. 

Ibogaine is surrounded by tremendous controversy (for controversial people.) The decisions regarding the use of ibogaine in the treatment of addiction appear to be made for political and economic reasons, rather than on the basis of its efficacy.
This project was started over two years ago under the auspices of the Utrecht School of the Arts. Since that time it has grown significantly in its scope, and became an initiative of LunArt Productions.

*And some video clips....mostly from the news.
*And some scientific papers 2.

THE POSSIBLE DANGER OF IBOGAINE TREATMENT IS OBVIOUSLY TO A LARGE DEGREE THE ILEGALIZER\'S RESPONSIBILITY\'S, THE TREATMENTS WOULD BE A LOT SAFER IN A HOSPITAL SETTING AND MORE PEOPLE WOULD BE  FREE FROM THE SLAVERY OF ADDICTIVE DRUGS. 

NOW THEY JUST DIE; DAY AFTER DAY ........  if it should be a civilization one day in 300 years, we have to move on ...
