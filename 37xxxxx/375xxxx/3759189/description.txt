The First Encounter Assault Recon team is a military group that takes an aggressive attitude towards ghosts, and while the reasons never become very clear, it's a fairly good setup for a unique take on first-person shooters. You'll take the role of one of the soldiers, investigating what is at first simply the case of an escaped convict who has some unusual dietary tendencies. From there, the fit quickly hits the shan, and you'll find yourself knee-deep in a tragic, ghostly conspiracy. Sometimes it resembles Resident Evil, other times Fatal Frame. But FEAR stands on its own as a challenging and nuanced experience that I think is one of the best shooters this year.
