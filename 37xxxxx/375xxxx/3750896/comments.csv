,NeverTheSame,2007-10-24T18:51Z,"I constantly seed my own torrents. There is always at least me seeding everything. It may take a while if I'm the only one seeding, as I'm currently seeding at least 15-20 torrents, but continue seeding the torrents after they are downloaded for at least 1 or 2 full uploads, and everything will work fine!"
