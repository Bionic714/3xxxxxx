Adventure game with a unique "Dia de los Muertos" look, from the mind of Tim Schafer. You play 
Manny Calavera, a mid-level worker at the Department of Death (the DOD) who's trying to work off 
his sins in life so that he can get to his final reward. As a reaper, Manny frees incoming 
souls from their shrouds, finds out what kind of underworld travel packages their goodness 
in life has earned them, and then sends them on their way. Unfortunately, business hasn't 
been very good for Manny of late. As the game begins, Calavera is told that he must sell 
a premium travel package to a soul or lose his job. In his search, Manny uncovers a 
hideous plot, a beautiful woman, and a crew of loyal friends (not necessarily in that order). 
The world is a rich one, complete with its own laws, its own personality types, and landscapes. 
The game takes place in four parts.
