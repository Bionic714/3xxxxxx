,freelancerx,2007-09-29T01:53Z,"i got this error while extracting:""Invalid or corrupt authenticity information""
but the files got extracted and Daemon tools seems to open them without problem"
,Sabrage,2007-10-09T06:26Z,"How do install this...? I mount GF-Disk1 and install that, but when I try to mount disk2 it isn't processed at all... And the game freezes after the first cutscene. Any help?"
,lethrinops,2007-10-27T02:04Z,this is the best game.
,Geezguy,2008-01-03T16:36Z,Buy this game instead...
,darkthorn,2008-02-05T13:11Z,"Lucasarts has re-released the game as a Lucasarts Classics title. Just buy it, it's cheap."
,storm9370,2008-08-23T13:24Z,"I've unrared the game but it says for every rar file that has been currupted. then I've instaleed and patched it. It works fine only a huge problem... there's no sound!!! only in the animations, otherwise nothing."
,Seatre,2009-02-26T01:49Z,it dont fucking work ...
,TheBlackWhirlwind,2010-08-25T04:47Z,This works so long as you download the patch 'gfupd101.exe' and set the game to play in Windows 98/ME compatibility mode. 
,Shuffle_,2011-05-01T18:28Z,Thank you.
,Damwoot,2011-08-17T15:59Z,Its a bad torrent.. The setup doesn't start after mounting the disc with daemon tools.
,djlothar,2012-01-08T13:24Z,"Download speed 4,5Mb/s. 
During extraction, I got errors for every part included. (Invalid or corrupt authenticity infromation.)
Daemon tools didnt mount the extracted .bin files. (Error in command line.)"
,djlothar,2012-01-08T13:48Z,"After little work, the daemon tools accepted it, but it still won't install, since I'm running 64bit OS. Oh well, tough luck."
,Sarcopterygii,2012-01-26T15:39Z,"There is another Grim Fandango upload by Trinnit2 that work perfectly. Just remember to adjust the game compatibility to Windows 98 if you're trying to run the game on for example a Windows 7 computer 64bit. That might even make it work with this upload too, I never tried since I got it to work with Trinnit2's upload. "
