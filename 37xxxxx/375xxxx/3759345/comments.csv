,kofmiester,2007-08-20T19:02Z,"Is there a way for Mac users to write the firmware to their iPods? Cause Windows machines cyar write to iPods formatted by Mac OS.
Any Mac users found a way for this procedure to work? Or was there another way that Mac OS X users got to successfully put the games on the iPod and be able to play them after?"

,Fyxxk,2008-03-16T16:12Z,"Eey thx m8! I just have a slight prob. The installation worked fine ( iPod Video 5.5g ) and when I booted up the iPod all my files were gone. I'm like; Okay, no biggie, the games are all there and working, I connect the iPod to my Pc and all the media-files look fine so I check again, and now the iPod finds the media files BUT the games don't work anymore "" Connect to Pc and reinstall via iTunes ""   So I'm now starting the install process again, I'll report back 2 yall .."
,Fyxxk,2008-03-16T21:16Z,"Okay, I now understand the problem, when it installs the games it downgrades the iPod to a earlier firmware, witch my itunes later on upgraded so ... If you don't upgrade you will be fine!"
,[Maga]Zine,2008-03-20T17:15Z,"guys this is out dated!
