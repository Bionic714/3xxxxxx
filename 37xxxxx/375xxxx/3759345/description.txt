iPod Games for 5gen and 5.5gen iPod Videos

I have them all on my 80 gig ipod video 5.5gen and they work great. I put togather a nice torrent which has all the current iPod games(not including Sims Pool which just came out yesterday, will upload that soon)

All you have to do is:

Step 1: Extract the RAR file from the torrent.
Step 2: Plug in your iPod.  Make sure it is enabled for disk use, and the "Do Not Disconnect" logo is flashing.
Step 3: Open up your iPod in "My Computer".  Enable hidden files and folders in "Folder Options".
Step 4: Open up the "iPod_Control" folder.
Step 5: Paste the "Games_RO" folder into the "iPod_Control" folder.
Step 6: Open up iPodWizard (it's a standalone file, no need to install)
Step 7: Change the edit mode to "Firmware File".
Step 8: Click "Open Firmware" and choose either "5g Firmware.bin" or "5.5g Firmware.bin" based on weather you have a 5g or a 5.5g iPod.  If you choose the wrong one, you will have to boot into disk mode and restore your iPod.
Step 9: Click "Write to iPod"
Step 10: Follow the instructions on the screen.  Eject the iPod when it is done.
Step 11: Reset your iPod by holding in the center button and play/pause button until the apple logo appears
Step 12: Go to Extras > Games on your iPod, choose your game, and enjoy.

Loading the firmware should NOT delete your music or videos.

Please dont flame me for "stealing" other peoples torrents... I know i used them I just put them togather... if you have uploaded Sims Pool Messege me

Thanks
