This is "East Coast (JWR)" Route for MSTS

Its a Fictional Route - free to download and play.
I made this route as a sample of what i can do in MSTS.
If you like it then let me know.
I have made quiet a few routes now all based on UK Trains.

When you install this into your `Routes` folder and
install the `Global` into your global folder.
This route will work.
it uses UK finescale track and you should have that installed, if not,
you can download it from my site or from UKfinescales own site.

For some special locos you can download them from my site as well.
If you want something else let me know and i`ll see if i can help.

I am at present building some payware routes, if your interested let me know.
