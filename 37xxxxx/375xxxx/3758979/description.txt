SYNOPSIS/PLOT: Clint Eastwood returns to his popular Dirty Harry character and directs himself in the role for the first time. The film starts with Harry leaving San Francisco at his superiors' insistence and going to a small seaside town for a little peace and quiet. There he becomes embroiled in a series of brutal murders committed by a young artist, Jennifer Spencer (Sondra Locke). She and her sister were raped by a group of local men, including the police chief's son, a few years back. The experience left Jennifer's sister completely catatonic, and Jennifer herself is tormented by flashbacks. While Harry investigates the killings, he falls in love with Jennifer, not knowing that she is committing the murders. Sudden Impact is a disturbing film in which Eastwood examines the darker aspects of Dirty Harry and comes up with a brooding, grim drama that has a hauntingly ambiguous ending.
