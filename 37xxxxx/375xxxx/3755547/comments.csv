,muddi900,2008-09-21T13:27Z,I am no getting any sound in XP
,Spironic,2008-10-18T06:41Z,"In response to the iffy reviews posted here, let me post my 2 cents.

It's a legit download.

The first time I ran it, it crashed right away.
The second time I ran it, it showed a corporate logo, then crashed.
The third, it ran perfectly fine.  I played for about 20 minutes with no interruptions.
It also ran fine a fourth and fifth time I was testing it.

I have no idea why this is. I didn't do or change anything at all, it just decided to work.  If you had the crashing problem, just try to run it again, maybe reboot or something.

Btw, excellent seeding job, took me about 10 minutes to download it at ~100-150kb/s."
