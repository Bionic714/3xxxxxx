There is a problem with the file - it runs again, after the end of the film, for more than an hour.You'll see that it has on official runnig Time of 219 Minutes (Director's Cut) but the file has a 4 hour 41 min (= 281 min) running time.As far as I can see there is no problem until the end of the film, things seem to be in order, it's just that the file got bigger by 1/3 and the whole thing looks a bit strange. Anyway - thanks again for the offer - great film!"

,dudu1964,2007-08-04T17:24Z,"New developments-in my Mac, VLC and MPlayer play it as a 4h41 file with the problems I mentioned, but QuickTime Player plays it as a 3h31 file, and cuts off the end! Strange...I'll burn and check on a standalone and let you know."
,dudu1964,2007-08-04T18:42Z,"Well, here it is.My standalone cuts off the last 7 minutes of the film. lord_terabyte, the 219 minutes are not in error, it's the 281 that is.If the file is a product of combining the 3 separate cds going around, here the 3rd cd has been attached a second time (so after the end of the film you get part 3 all over again, which would explain the size which is a 4 cd one).It would have been a purely cosmetic problem, but it somehow messes up the file at the end for some players. Interestingly, for them (QTime, my standalone) it signals the end of the film at exactly 3.31.20, with the overlong file having a 4.41.20 duration (and the film 3.38.40-approx.) VLC reads the file to the end, repeating part 3 after the end credits - with a few glitches (EOF error when it passes the 3.31.20 mark) - but you certainly can enjoy the film. That's all from me, if somebody observes something else, please let us know. lord_terabyte, thanks again for the upload, great film. "
[V],lord_terabyte,2007-08-06T03:49Z,"Thanks for looking into this! I downloaded this from usenet, and I wish I had saved the files so I could see if the third CD was doubled. 

I see using VLC that subtitles don't work in the first copy of the duped third CD, and the audio is quite a bit off in the last...

Could I have done this when I joined the AVIs?"
,ArghMatey2006,2008-02-16T14:24Z,Thanks for this torrent.  Been looking for ages for it.  Although it had the CD3 added on twice it can be easily fixed with VirtualDub.  5 min job!

,QuantumDriven,2009-03-22T02:42Z,"Well I'm going for it.  I'm very curious as to how this film could've knocked United Artists out of business.  I bet it's okay.
Remember, that Gran Torino didn't EVEN get an Oscar nomination, so that's evidence enough that citizens and Hollywood are dumbasses. "
