,zcorvine9,2008-01-30T04:50Z,Thank you.  I needed a FLAC to WAV converter.  Installation + Key GEN worked fine.
,zcorvine9,2008-01-30T07:28Z,"Update.  Ouch.  I tried to convert an Immrama Insight CD FLAC file into WAV.  Since there's a blank in about 33% into the FLAC, that's all I received - 1/3 the FLAC converted to WAV.  

Just pointing out an observation, which I'm SURE is not always common in other FLAC's."
