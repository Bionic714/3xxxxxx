,spankymasterc,2007-07-24T01:22Z,its the same thing it wont bug you just do the patch... thats the only i have found... same as the other torrent u cant download 
,braheem,2007-07-24T01:43Z,"No thats not what i mean , the patch says Day 1, but when u try to do anything it says that your in trial mode,  i wouldnt mind using the patch every time  but it doesnt work"
,braheem,2007-07-24T01:47Z,"NVM mate, it works, but u cant adjust preferences or it will stop working and ull need to apply patch again"
,spankymasterc,2007-07-24T02:38Z,it hasnt said anything to me? nothing at all ive only used it once.... lol maybe i got lucky? i mean i see it says 1 day but its working for me like full version...
,braheem,2007-07-24T03:35Z,"No no dont worry its just dont click ""apply profiles to games automatically"" on the preferences, that screwed it up for me "
,braheem,2007-07-24T05:00Z,"AHH i  know whats wrong with this, it changes your system clock, thats really messed up, u gotta change ur system clock back, thus u cant run MSN or many other apps while u use the patch, it sucks hard , "
,WhiteMerve,2007-07-24T12:54Z,"hi guys i thought id join you on your quest to try and crack this triall shit!, i think this is the first bit of software that i have needed that no one has cracked.  
"
,WhiteMerve,2007-07-24T13:14Z,lol i tryed using that no limit date faker crack and now i can only use pinnacle for 15 mins at a time 
,braheem,2007-07-24T16:52Z,"The no limit date faker is a load of BS, changes ur System clock, its from 1999, and its not meant for this kind of program, it has advanced protection, i tried to crack it, disassemble it, use Hackers View, its impossible, its so protected you need a l33t cracker to do the job"
,WhiteMerve,2007-07-24T18:11Z,"ah right i see , don't suppose you know any crackers who are up for the task? btw do you know of any other free soft where that does the same sort of thing as pinnacle , its proving a nightmare trying to get my wire less 36o controller to work on my pc !"
,braheem,2007-07-24T23:05Z,"Xpadder4, its free, but u gotta do everything manually i think, im gonan go use it now until i buy PInnacle Game Profiler."
,Jasjeet,2007-07-25T19:05Z,same problems!!!! for me too
,Jasjeet,2007-07-25T19:10Z,"good job on finding something atleast, i wos stumped"
,WhiteMerve,2007-07-25T22:15Z,"yeah thanks , xpadder seems pretty decent and it fully supports the 360 wireless controller to ."
,spankymasterc,2007-07-25T23:28Z,yeah no problem but im still wondering about a crack damn it lol if someone finds something post it!
,braheem,2007-07-26T22:31Z,"Im glad u like xpadder4, honestly its so un-userfriendly i just uninstalled it, POS app ive never seen worse, what they need to do is just have a profiler for the 360 controller made my microsoft, just like logitech makes profilers for their controllers, this is outrageous"
,jzsnowboarder,2007-12-04T23:33Z,ye xpadder is bred and butter..wish we cud get this workin looks mint..infact might stretch t buying it ..20 dollars thats a tenner ...wrth it imo coz i use the 360pad for every game ...cheers for the patches put on here...my gaming machine i dont use msn etc bs only gamin s im not fussed

,JustRob,2009-07-13T16:27Z,"If you're thinking about downloading this, don't. The code Qbenzie gave you does NOT work. None of the codes work. I've replayed the same level over and over again because it crashes 15 minutes even when I entered the code. It's a false code and it doesn't work. NoLimit doesn't work either. You're going to have to buy this program or find a free version. I've tried to crack this for three hours now and no success. Stop wasting your energy on it and find something better.

Follow these steps:

1: DO NOT USE NoLimits, IT DOES NOT WORK!!!
2: Install PGP.
3: Disconnect internet.
4: Enter registration info (It is the quintan corder thing, but DO NOT PUT A SPACE BETWEEN ""quintancorder""!!!)
5: After finished, exit PGP.
6. Open PGP, then after it boots, connect internet.
7. Go to regedit.exe, and search for PGP_DATA.
8. Change the date key (should be like this: 05/10/10) last two digits to 99.
9. Have FUN!!!

This works, I've been playing for two hours now!!! I'll post this on the other torrents too!!!"
,Lullla,2010-07-13T16:53Z,"@T.T.CrnrnI did whatever you explained, but I still get kicked out of game after 15 mins.rnBTW what do you mean by changing the date key?

I desperately want to play games using it for much more than 15 mins."

and works perfect i love it  :DD

i love you alll AAAAALLLL :D "
,leoVM,2010-11-28T11:00Z,@lulla : i had the same problem but i found the solution ... run pgp and press F4 ... you can change the serial there... just put in the codes everyone is uploading... all we had to do was press the fukin F4 button... im so frustrated ... lol
,wilkshyre,2011-03-17T18:21Z,"Been fighting this pinnacle profiler for a couple weeks now and honestly there are two ways you can do this if you want to use a controller for free.

1. DO NOT enter in the quintan corder info, it DOES NOT work, pinnacle must have patched the game specifically for this user bc although it will appear that it worked, in actuality it doesn't, and after 30 days it will stop working, plus it will get lodged in your registry and you will have to do a deep scrub of it searching out every entry of Pinnacle, KalinkoSoft, and Power Up Gaming. Although this only took me 20 or so minutes to complete it is still a pain in the ass.

So if you want to use pinnacle DL the trial from their site and use it normally, when your thirty days is almost up use REGEDIT and search PGP_DATA, when it comes up select the first run entry and set it to a day or two before the actual date, i.e. if it is March 20th, set the first run to March 19, and so on. DO NOT CHANGE THE YEAR.

This will trick pinnacle into thinking there are X amount of days left on your trial. You will have to do this each time you want to use it and it is kinda a pain in the ass also, but it works and it is free.

Your other options are A. Buy it B. DL XPadder, it is free, not as intiuitive, but works just as well. It is kind of a bitch to set up but once i got it working everything was smooth as could be.

Not a spammer or some dickless lizard working for XPadder, just a fellow traveller who has grown sick of trying to make fucking pinnacle work.

Cheers All."
