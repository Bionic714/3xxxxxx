I've been collecting doll movies of late and thought someone on here might find this one interesting. Nothing special, but a little bit different. I had a some fun with it.

There is an unfortunate review on the IMDB page that I feel isn't exactly fair. It uses the argument that all dolls movies are child's play knock-offs. I'm sure there are many many many more examples, but I do know that Stuart Gordon's "Dolls" was released before Child's Play.

Or maybe there should only be one doll movie, one frankenstein, one vampire, one person who turns into an animal, one motorcycle movie, one for war. I suppose maybe if that is to be the argument, we can stop making movies.

Yes, this movie is kind of dumb. But that's exactly what I want it to be.
