I remember back in the day when it was WinMX or bust.  The only competitors were Napster, which had been put on hiatus cuz James Hetfield's a little bitch, and KaZaA, which just blew.

Glad to see someone else remembers those days."

I never got around of trying Napster since they had closed down when I got online for the first time, so for me WinMX was a natural choice. Just for nostalgias sake I downloaded and installed a patch about a year ago, but when I started WinMX and connected, I discovered that not much had changed at all. Because even when the WinMX community have become so small as it is now, there are still a lot of idiots who don't share what they download. I guess some people will never learn.

Yes it is true that WinMX was shut down a while ago, but there are others who are running things now, and for those who are interested, here is a link to their site:

[T],Perlite,2008-11-10T01:59Z,GenPollux: WinMX and Kazaa both ran on the same network (Gnutella) which is still very popular. LimeWire among many other p2p programs still run on this network.
