,Carobu,2007-08-07T02:52Z,The first release and the second release are all included in this all the same books execept bigger that way if you get into the releases before 
,youngidealist,2007-08-26T09:42Z,The only thing men know that women don't is plenty about their genital anatomy. Take a damn course in psychology of human sexuality and learn what a taboo is.
,youngidealist,2007-08-26T09:53Z,"What moron thought to put in a Scientology book by L. Ron Hubbard? That shit's more misleading and ambiguous than the book of Mormon. Also, you should try using some new studies on social psychology and cognition in the psychology section. If you're lucky, you might even stumble across a book that explains how human beings are complete heroine addicts when it comes to culture (because the neurotransmitters released in our brain when we go along with culture norms are the same thing that's in chocolate and heroine). You are 21st century college students right? Go study!"
,ssddbmlap,2007-09-25T21:43Z,"There are some good books in the collection but others are close to useless. I would point out that most of the languages represented in guides are not  for absolute begginers and require at least a fundamental knowledge beforehand - knowing the alphabet and/or basic grammar. 
Also I'd like to caution against trying anything from the ""Anarchist's Cookbook"" if you don't have a solid backing in chemistry, physics or mind being caught in the act because of the severely outdated info in parts of the book. 
This is from a first glance so anything further you   can assess for yourself. 
Even so many thanks to the uploader - I will thoughtfully enjoy the Locke collection as well as  the whole section. "
,TheKingofOblivion,2007-10-02T10:58Z,"Seconding the warnings on the 'Anarchist's Cookbook' - it's dangerous to the user in a lot of sections, as well as being laughably worthless in many others.

The only absolutely indispensable book on the list, of course, is the Zombie Survival Guide.  When there is no more room in hell, will YOU be prepared?!"
,ellmarto,2007-10-07T15:15Z,"thanks alot for the books. they're pretty cool.

dr web reports it as clean
panda active scan reports it as clean

so probably just a false positive"
,RainbowDissent,2008-02-24T20:25Z,"""Also I'd like to caution against trying anything from the ""Anarchist's Cookbook"" if you don't have a solid backing in chemistry, physics or mind being caught in the act because of the severely outdated info in parts of the book.""

If you have a solid grounding in chemical science you wouldn't try most of the shit in that book in the first place."
,smucktor,2008-05-13T23:17Z,"I just want to thank the uploader and express my deep regret that people like ""youngidealist"" are free to wander around (by the aggressiveness of his tone he seems not young nor idealist, but the name is a free choice). Well, I understand that people like you, like all geniuses (you are even less rare than you think), want to free the world from ignorance (disregarding that sometimes ignorance is bliss or a rational choice), but I am beginning to lose hope that someone could free it from the likes of you. 
Of course, you sound well educated, so you should know that there is a huge difference between knowing things, knowing people and knowing yourself. You seem to know things, but unfortunately it did not make you smarter. Like all the ""quotation champions"", you forget that ""I am right and you are wrong and for your right to be wrong I am ready tot die"". I fear you are not able to die, not even for yourself. You might be an idealist just fit for the French Revolution, one who builds piles of severed heads in the name of truth, justice, equity or some other superstitions.
I still don't believe that an intelligent person can use such a tone and words as related to others. There is only one moron here. And in response to your horrible ""Go study!"", I'll try to put it as bluntly as you did, although I don't think I can do it: ""Go check the mirror. You must be a sad little man!""
I know you could turn me to dust with subtle arguments and irrepressible eloquence in just one post, but I won't access it anymore. It makes me sick just knowing I share the whole Internet with such specimens that make this world a dumphole.

So thank you again, uploader, and keep up the good work (only if you want to). I have downloaded this torrent and there is nothing useless in it (even though not all is useful to me). And this is only because you never forced anyone to download it and read it and write essays about it. Don't let genetic accidents like such young idealists discourage you."
,Carobu,2008-05-23T06:06Z,The newest version is out and released. If you liked this check out the new release here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4201489/The_Enlightened_Mans_Book_Collection_3
,cokecankicker,2008-06-11T12:26Z,"if your afraid of the file size, dont be... i went through and unchecked everything i didnt want/or already had and got it down to 350 from 900mb. still gona take a long ass time, but im betting its worth it. looks like an awesome selection. good job carobu."
,GalvinTjime,2008-08-31T20:37Z,"I really do say, thank you for all of the books you have taken the time to put up. Currently I only need The World is Flat however, when I get the chance, I plan to download as much as I can. Keep up the great work Carobu!
