Toontrack Music Twisted Kit EZX for EZdrummer

The Twisted Kit EZX by Michael Blair was sampled through the very best of outboard with distortion, reverb, compression and attack effects included in the internal mixer. This enables you to access a large number of mixer presets by STS 9, Richard Devine, DJ Amplive, sub-ID and Count Bass D. And you can save your own custom mixer presets (with EZdrummer 1.1).

EZDrummer 1.11 update included.

If update seems to fail - check that the EZDrummer.dll file has been installed to your host vst program.

Do a search for ezdrummer.dll sometimes the dll is placed in a vst folder on C not your programs / host / vst folder .

Overwrite with newer file
