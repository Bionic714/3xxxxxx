,Diaos,2008-02-14T02:17Z,"Guide

Note: This program is an expansion of a VST plug-in. This means you need to already have the basic version of Ezdrummer installed and you'll need a music program that uses VST plugins. Don't already have these things? Start elsewhere. 

1. You download the torrent using a program that handles torrents. I use Frostwire.

2. After downloading highlight all the compressed files and right click and press ""extract here""

3. After extracting you'll see there's still extracted things. Open the first one and extract the .iso file. 

4. Mount the .iso image using Daemon Tools. Then when the pop up window comes up follow the folders until you see an install exe. Install.

5. Find the keygen elsewhere. For some reason the uploader included the wrong ones.

6. Open your host music program that does VST plugins. You should already have installed the basic EZdrummer. Try to use the new Twisted kit and it'll prompt you for a code. Use the keygen to get this. 

7. Enjoy. "
,Diaos,2008-02-16T04:49Z,"Ok yeah, there's no keygen and the two on the other site aren't actually keygens... but BS programs. 

Anyone got one?

,sailorfjodde,2008-02-18T20:22Z,"HI, I have extracted teh rar. File and found the iso. file. but when i try to extract it it commes up a message: You need to have the following volume to continue the extraction:

C:\Documents and Settings\Andreas\Local Settings\Temp\Rar$DI54.765\air-ezxtwisted.r01

Insert a disk with this volume and press ""OK"".. How can i fix this?"
,sailorfjodde,2008-02-18T20:42Z,I think i got it all right after all;) but ty anyways^^
,sailorfjodde,2008-02-18T20:57Z,"i have all files but ""C:\EZ\air-ezxtwisted.r10"" :("
,Diaos,2008-02-27T02:13Z,"Try looking into the other rar files for a different iso. When you've mounted the right one (and I do think there's more than one for some reason) it should work without a hitch. 

I'm still looking for the keygen though. Anyone got it and could run my number for me? "
,Diaos,2008-02-27T02:15Z,! Make sure you're extracting everything in the same folder too. This could be your problem.

,EvilRottenPirate,2009-03-20T04:37Z,"Successfully install EzDrummer and Extra Libraries:
Step-by-Step Instructions to answer 1,000 questions asked in ""comments.""

To begin with, all torrents and files listed below are free of Trojans (at The Pirate Bay) and work like magic. Disregard comments by know-nothing noobies who swear the sky is falling.

1. EzDrummer and many of its libraries are available in torrents in ISO format at The Pirate Bay. An ISO is like a CD or a DVD, but you need specialized software to use an ISO DISK, because it is ""virtual,"" not ""plastic."" To use an ISO file, download a program called Daemon Tools, which is free and legal. (Use a search engine to find it.) Don't use a torrent for Daemon Tools; many such torrents have Trojans.

2. Install EzDrummer 1.0. An excellent torrent exists at The Pirate Bay

3. Use the keygen to ""authorize"" EzDrummer 1.0. Do not contact Toontrack on the Internet -- not ever -- because the crack is all you need. The first time you run EzDrummer. the program will show you a window that contains your Computer ID. Typewrite the ID into the keygen, execute the keygen, and then you will see your number for authorization. Copy the authorization number into the proper ""slot"" below the Computer ID. Click on the ""authorize button."" All done. Repeat the process whenever you use a new library for the first time.

4. Install EzDrummer update 1.1.1. You MUST install update 1.1.1 to make your additional libraries function. You DON'T need a keygen to update. Find it here at The Pirate Bay. (Search for ""EzDrummer').

Now you may install -- with success -- many additional libraries. All, or most, of the libraries below can be found at The Pirate Bay. Search for EzDrummer.

""Drumkit from Hell,"" Vintage Rock and ""Latin Rhythms"" do not need a crack. (God bless Team AIR.)
Twisted: After you install update 1.1.1, install Twisted. Use the keygen, which is located in a file named ""air-ezxtwistedkgn.rar.""

Nashville has a keygen in the file named ""air-ezxnashkgn.rar.""

""Funkmasters"" has a keygen in the ISO file.

What about Claustrophobia? In truth, I just don't know.

Remember: Piracy might be illegal where you live (so move away.)

God bless everyone who seeds (and devil take the rest)."
