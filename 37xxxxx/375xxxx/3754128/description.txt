Get a taste of the radio programs that inspired "Good Morning Vietnam" (yes, it's in there; track 1). Constructed from AFVN voice recordings and modern CD rips, and uploaded to Demonoid, by Candledipper:


His description:

I put the CD together a number of years ago to remind me of some of the good times in '67 and '68 in the trenches behind the barbed wire. Even through the censorship and the propaganda the pleasure that came out of the little speakers of the transistor radios were a welcome respite. I share them with you now in hopes that you also will enjoy.

My notes:

I'm uploading it as it came. The original used to fit on a CD, but in uploading one of the files was found to be corrupted and replaced. The result is 82:34. To make it fit on a CD and to make it more reaslistic, I suggest the following:

Normalize the files to equalize the volume.
Remove the gaps between the tracks to make it more radio-like.
The result will be just over 81:30. You can either overburn at this point, or drop a file. I dropped the last, and the result was just under 80:00.

If you want a more realistic experience, you can use an equalizer to drop out the bass and some mid-range and the high treble, to make it sound like a tinny little transistor radio. If you do that, you'd probably also want to listen to it lying in mud with camo paint on your face. Ah, memories.
