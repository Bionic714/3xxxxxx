,Laci78,2007-07-29T19:52Z,"Hi, there's no sound in the video. Why? Which codec or videoplayer should I use to solve this problem? Thanks in advance! "
,rh128592,2007-08-01T21:36Z,"Anyone else having this problem?  I just used xVid, played it with VLC, and had no problems.

Which video in particular, or is it all of them?

Sorry for the trouble...

,TheBigNoob,2007-11-07T07:25Z,Pretty good stuff. I lost 15 pounds in the last month or two with these videos. Thumbs up

That's cool as shit.  Thanks for posting.

I, failing to follow you lead, have probably gained about 5 lbs. over the past month. Tough to get motivated to train when it gets cold."
,aReaGr,2008-10-21T00:21Z,"Thanks for sharing this, and thanks for compressing so all of us with slow connections can download. 

I am an intermediate yoga practitioner, eager to take a peek into some new programs. 

I found the pilates routine very interesting, I am gonna give it a go. 

The Yoga Zone seemed a little bit too boring and obsolete for my taste. 

Yee, is Yee, as always. The Strength part of the three videos seems a little too advanced for my level. "
,rh128592,2009-02-18T12:42Z,"Yeah, Yoga Zone is only good if you're checking out that one chick with the hot voice (that d-bag guy with her is actually her husband).

At the time it was tough finding Yoga videos that weren't all ""New Age""."
,ryantron-,2009-06-09T01:13Z,"You have tons of great yoga videos up, i was wondering if you have ever come across 'Leah Bracknell Yoga and You' if yes please please please upload :)"
