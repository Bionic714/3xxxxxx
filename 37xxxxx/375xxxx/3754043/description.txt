This Yoga compilation is the same as this one: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3732501/Yoga_Compilation_DVD_2_ISO

Anarkhy requested a smaller file size, so give him/her the props for the idea.  This doesn\\\'t have the DVD menus, it\\\'s not an ISO, it\\\'s just the individual files compressed.  But if you use your computer to play DVDs then I guess a 4GB download is unnecessary.


Obviously you can pick which ones you want.  The Pilates chick is kinda\\\' hot (Tara- the one in green) although she\\\'s grainy when compressed and her shimmering abs are blurry.  Tara: call me.  I\\\'ll treat you well.  Don\\\'t tell Mook.

Here\\\'s the virus note: there are none.  Zilch.  Zero.  I\\\'m not that smart.  And I\\\'m lazy.
