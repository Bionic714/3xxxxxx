Many thanks for this rarity! Do you have any idea about the source of this (obviously some European release because of 25fps), seeing as it's still not released on DVD in Sweden nor UK?? (A German DVD was released in 2009 and a US one in 2011, but then this torrent is from 2007.)
As for the audio track I just had a listen in headphones and it does indeed sound like mono - the original sound mix - and not stereo or 5.1 for that matter, really curious about why it's encoded as that..."
