[T],__X-Man__,2007-08-10T21:22Z,"huh? I watched it a bit, and saw nothing special.
Can someone tell me watch exactly wrong?

Well, don't heave it anymore though ... so following people be warned - even when I don't know what it is."
[T],__X-Man__,2007-08-10T21:27Z,"I *think* I can remeber watching this video fine with VLC or K-Lite codec pack. But well, I do not want to spread ads by video. :-/"
[T],bill_214,2008-10-02T06:22Z,"It evidently downloads the whole file but
it won't play with VLC player at all and when you
try to play it with Windows Media Player it just has a pic the directs you to vodei.com to download something,

I can't use it."
