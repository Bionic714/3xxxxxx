,ashenvale03,2011-05-05T19:51Z,"@poples ei, after you type the serials just continue the process but when they ask for activation through internet just click cancel and something will prompt that it will just last for 30 days... after that click Ok then close..... after you close PS CS8 Box, COPY the 2 files inside the crack folder on Adobe PS folder then go to C:/ -> Program Files -> adobe -> Photoshop -> then Paste .. if somethings prompts like you have to choos to COPE & REPLACE ,  or COPY & DUPLICATE, Just choose the copy and Replace... and everythings fine"
,Flying_Poo,2011-05-19T22:38Z,"For anyone that misreads this; This is Photoshop 8 not CS8, there is no such thing as CS8 at the time of writing the latest is CS5.5. I Recommend CS3 personally."
,Funks1111,2011-05-27T11:33Z,"@ashenvale03,I copied the files from the crack folder and runned it but then next time i open PS it says ""Unable to continue Because of a hardware or system error.Sorry,But the error is un recoverable.And alsso when i tried the test tool i couldnt use it -,-"
,thomassen234,2011-06-03T21:11Z,Is this for windows?
,Valon,2011-06-28T19:39Z,Thanks !! :D Worked perfect :)
,1stDash,2012-01-11T18:16Z,"Thanks for the upload, but it is NOT the latest version. It is the first version Photoshop CS & shows as version 8. I already had CS2 which shows up as version 9.

Thanks again, but beware this is not the latest version available, you would be better advised looking for CS3 or CS4, both of which can be found here on PB.
