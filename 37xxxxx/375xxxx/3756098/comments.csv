,FlyingAnvil,2007-09-11T20:26Z,THIS TORRENT CONTAINS A TROJAN - SHeur.DNY
,wiz2111,2007-09-16T05:57Z,6.8ghz??? dumb ass! i've never heard of a compuer that passed 5!! get a fuckin life.
,tallowjim,2007-09-18T18:05Z,hey could sumone please send me bios nd plugins that work for pcsx2 to tallowjim@hotmail.com please
,northbadda,2007-11-08T03:26Z,"6.8 ghz,..my ass!!....>tha_specializt< what kinda fag r u making stuffs out..huh...what a fucking dutchbag....and for other guys, this is fake, it doesn't work, try out sth else ..good luck!"
,Torgard,2007-11-16T19:15Z,"There's a Trojan in the installation file, rest is clean.

And btw. It should be usable with 1.5GHZ. My old computer had that, and it could use it. Slow but acceptable."
,technoguy_lk,2007-11-23T17:47Z,"jonaza45, well done on making a foolish reputation for yourself. The most powerful processor so far reaches around 4.8 GHz, or even less. Try to confirm your facts before you put others down.


About the PS2X (0.9.4):-

Works surprisingly well with Quad Core 2.40 GHz computer. You actually get the bios screen working well. But of course you need a middle-range graphics card and also you need to reduce the graphics quality setting in the plugin.

If you have dual/quad core, then enable the MTGS and DC in the CPU Settings.

Thanks a lot to piaoginn for the BIOS files."
,assassin127,2007-11-24T19:31Z,where do i download the games ??
,trlkly,2007-12-04T12:20Z,"Isn't it fun to be surrounded by IDIOTS?

The FAQ for PS2-Emulation says this EXACTLY:
[It] takes a lot of Resources, with less than 6,8 Ghz youÂ´re screwed.

So stop calling the guy an idiot for quoting the developers

Of course, if any of you guys actually surfed the net instead of bittorrenting everything, you'd know this wasn't fake. 6ghz is the desired speed for perfect emulation. And there already are 6000+ computers. "
,rayza563,2007-12-09T12:31Z,6.8Ghz is like the next level after recommended comp specs on a computer game... you can play this with only 3-4Ghz my 5.2Ghz will have no worries especially with a DX10 8600GT 512mb... 
,TheSdrawkcab,2008-01-10T23:05Z,"Actually, havinga 6000+ processor doesn't mean you're running at 6gz. Its a misconception with AMD products. Intel can barely make 5.5ghz(which is pretty fuckin xpensive...and it's overclocked too). An amd 6600+ runs at 3.5ghz I believe. A 5600+ runs at 2.8ghz. No fuckin way the common man's gonna get a 6+Ghz processor. Obviously the makers of the emulators made an error or some kind of misjudgment/misunderstanding/exaggeration. Cuz 6ghz is nearly impossible at this state in technology. I pity you stupid mothafuckaz!"
,TheSdrawkcab,2008-01-10T23:06Z,"I meant to say amd6400, sorry. Only intel has a 6600 model name processor(and 6ghz is not it's speed)"
,greatwiz666,2008-04-04T16:04Z,any chance that it will work 2.0gz?
