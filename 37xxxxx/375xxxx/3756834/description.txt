              Episode Notes:

          
          Seven bodies were found in the crawl space under his home. Eight
          more were quickly uncovered in other parts of the house, some in 
          trenches covered in quicklime. Eventually, the remains of twenty
          -eight were discovered. When he had run out of burial space he 
          started dumping bodies in the river. His victims were male and 
          the disappearances continued until the thirty-third killing 
          brought the police with a search warrant to the house.
