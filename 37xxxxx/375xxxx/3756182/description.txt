this is a DVD-rip of Trumbull's first directorial attempt; 
it is a very emotional story, with great acting and the best special effects of any 70's movie; never got too much public attention due to the lack of advertising, but it is nonetheless a tribute to Douglas Trumbull's genius.
i believe it to be a must-have for serious sci-fi fans.


the torrent which i had got was compressed as a multi-volume archive; but it would be a lot more comfortable to download it as a pure ISO, which this torrent is. although there is a 240 MB overhead, there is no more need to extract. burn it onto a DVD-5 or load it up in an emulator such as Daemon tools.
also includes commentary, interviews and making of, as separate divx video. depending on your preferences, you will need a DL/HD/BDR disc, or 2 DVD-5 discs.


seeding will be done at up to 32 KB/s, mostly evenings on GMT+2 time zone. I only seed in fully encrypted mode, so you must use clients that support encryption.	


torrent info:	

I merged two of the best torrentz about this movie. they weren't exactly easy to find, and together they have all the materials a serious release should have.

all the credit goes to the wonderful pirates who ripped and seeded the material in the original torrents. i've simply pasted them together.

the large nrg file in this torrent is identical to the one in another of my torrents. i left that one stuck at about 31%, but anyone can replace it in this torrent's folder, and resume with no loss.

Bitcomet is recommended for resuming the nrg file, and for better compatibility, as it is the client i'm seeding with.

piece size is 8 MB, in an effort to minimize overhead, in terms of bandwidth and tracker resources.





Enjoy ;-)
