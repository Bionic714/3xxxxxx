,roma_barca,2007-07-28T23:57Z,sounds great ! The poster on IMDB too...No french subs by luck ??
,asp4dos,2007-07-29T00:07Z,"sorry. no French subs. and i've been desperately looking for them, for my father. so if you find a French sub file, please let me know."
,asp4dos,2007-07-29T00:09Z,"btw. no seeding at night. i've got trouble with the power supply's ventilator, and dont want to risk it by leaving the system unsupervised."
,svettipung,2007-07-29T06:26Z,"Wrong Category!
.avi files goes under movies!"
,reichert,2007-07-29T07:39Z,"
Soundtracks of this movie:

    * ""Silent Running""
        Performed by Joan Baez !

    * ""Rejoice in the Sun""
        Performed by Joan Baez !

...A ""must have"" for Joan Baez fans "
,asp4dos,2007-07-29T12:22Z,"@Reichert. sorry. didn't bother to rip them. thought it is so simple (them being not mixed with any sounds from the movie) that any Joan Baez fans would do it themselves.

@svettipung
give me a break, punk. 

it's got the docz as *.avi, and the movie as a DVDR containing VIDEO_TS folder and 1 GB *.vobs."
,Guilba,2007-07-30T16:16Z,"Dowloaded 16 times and just one seed?? That's lame guys, help on seeding."
,roma_barca,2007-08-07T23:49Z,"asp4dos, I take this torrent...

AND I WILL TRY TO TRANSLATE THE ENGLISH SUBS...If the result is good enough, I will let you know here !"
,asp4dos,2007-08-15T18:26Z,"sorry for the 2-week pause in seeding. again on holiday. but this time i will seed until everyone gets it. unfortunately there is an error with the counter; actually nobody had a chance to download this torrent. it is at 8.1 % right now, and climbing."
,runner_one,2007-08-29T05:00Z,"Been Looking for this movie forever.
Please Seed"
,asp4dos,2007-09-07T00:49Z,"i' left somebody at ~85%. when all seeders will synch with him, i will seed another 10%. upload is not very fast in my country."
,Hymie1,2009-03-04T21:55Z,Can anyone still seed this ? We're stuck at 94.4%.
,Hymie1,2009-03-09T18:54Z,This torrent is dead.
,DanielAmandoLG,2010-05-12T19:28Z,"I got stuck at 99.8%. I think I saw somebody seeding yesterday, but I'm not sure (hopefully, s/he will show up again). Anyway, I'm leaving my computer running for the day.

As they are, things aren't that bad: the ""main feature"" is complete, and so are the interviews. The only part missing, is a tinny, little piece of the commentary track.

In case I got it, I promisse to seed the whole package, for at least a week, and without more than an hour break each day."
,John_Doe1214,2011-10-29T06:12Z,Please SEED!! I'm at 84.7% so far. I've been hunting for this movie for years with no success. Now that I'm this close... the suspense is driving me crazy ;-)
,John_Doe1214,2011-10-29T17:26Z,"THANK YOU to the mysterious benefactor who seeded!!! I was able to finish the movie last night. Many hit & run, but when someone does something nice, we often forget to thank them. THANK YOU!!"
