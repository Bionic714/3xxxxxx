Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones is the sixth official compilation album by The Rolling Stones and was initially released worldwide, except in North America, in 1993. The North American release finally came two years after the career-spanning retrospective Forty Licksâ??in 2004.

The first Rolling Stones compilation packaged in the CD era, Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones, which stretches from 1971's Sticky Fingers to most recent studio album Steel Wheels in 1989, makes good use of its extra running time and, as a result, is the most expansive single disc retrospective of the band's post-1970 work, although some of the tracks appear in edited forms.

The very first release under their contract with Virgin Records in November 1993 (while Voodoo Lounge was being recorded), Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones reached #16 in the UK and became an enduring seller. Despite its very belated release in the US in 2004, it managed to peak at #30 and go Platinum.
