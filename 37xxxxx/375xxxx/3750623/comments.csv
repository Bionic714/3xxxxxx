,SkurrePurre2,2007-07-23T20:18Z,"No this isn't the real one.
Somebody have just encoded all the trailers thats out on the net, and have used some old episodes in it.

Sorry guys, but this isn't the real.
And btw, the trailers have BAD CROP!!!"
,Jessica FTWFTW,2007-07-23T20:22Z,hm hm and what did the torrent describe? gaaaaasp! 
,SkurrePurre2,2007-07-23T21:12Z,"Somebody have done this rip to fake!
Beacuse, the trailer shows in the whole movie.
First in the beginning and then in the middle and then in the end.. And the person who made this have done the movie ""1h 24m"" and the real movie is 1h 27m! :)

Yeye, this is just shit.
Do not download it :)"
,fozey,2007-07-23T21:54Z,"funny how the description has changed from an hour ago. before it was "" i dont know what this is i hate the simpsons just download it and see "" now its the truth, just some trailers + old episode, which should have been the correct description in the first place"
