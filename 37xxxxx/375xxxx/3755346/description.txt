I have successfully performed the upgrade on an AVIC-D1 using this disc. The disc includes both the software upgrade, 
and the new TeleAtlas data. The original image (7.1Gb) was obtained using Alcohol 120% (Media Descriptor File, MDF). 
It was compressed using WinRAR. You will need to decompress the MDF file to the original 7.1Gb image, then burn it to 
a double layer (DVD-DL) disc. This will only fit on a double layer disc. Insert disc to automatically start the upgrade.  
It takes about 10 minutes.
