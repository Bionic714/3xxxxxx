,explor202,2007-08-01T01:53Z,"Thanks sharing this, but I have a question. When I mount the image I see that most of the .jpg files are 0kb (BGOPEN, BGOPEN2, SENSORBD, etc). I mount the image using Daemon, and view/edit with UltraISO. Can you confirm that they're good images once this is burned? "
,chia9876,2007-08-18T00:23Z,"I'm using a copy  in my Avic-D2 from the real Pioneer DVD and it shows the files as 0 bytes too. Use IsoBuster  (freeware) and you will see the real file structure. Pioneer did something to the file structure and if you modify the ISO, the DVD will not work. "
,docsavage852,2007-08-25T20:43Z,East file shows as corrupt. 
,garrettoomey1,2007-08-31T14:44Z,"Use Alcohol 120% as the file states.  This is not corrupt, and the 0kb files are normal.  There are a bunch of people seeding this because they are using it.  I have it running in my D1."
