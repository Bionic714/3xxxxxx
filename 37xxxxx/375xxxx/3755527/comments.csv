,DJControllic,2007-07-28T14:14Z,"Virus do not download

Confirmed."
,T3hLaughingMan,2007-07-29T01:33Z,"Well to the th2 posts above me you obviously didn't  download it so it's not ""confirmed."" Well anyway it's not a virus, its to teach people to not download this it doesn't harm your computer in any way. If any one of the 28 people who have downloaded it would post it would be confirmed. I got tired of seeing these with downloads so I decided to intervene to save a few souls. To everyone how downloaded this I hope you learned your lesson.             Once again it's not in anyway going to hurt your computer it's just a way for me to educate people who download this. So to the ""I love these uploaders, they have this ability to prove to the world they are actually idiots,"" yes that is what I'm trying to do but I'm trying to help them in the future. If you want the source give me your e-mail and I will send it to you to prove that it is not a virus. Well I just blew the Idea of this but, I'm sure people will still download this without reading any comments."
,T3hLaughingMan,2007-07-29T03:44Z,"And my counter claims:

""Virus do not download

Confirmed.""

So if it's confirmed... you downloaded it and scanned it? Then what is it... Oh thats right you didn't

""The best part these master hackers cant even bind an infection into a file so as not to be detected.""

Trust me I can

""So backward and ignorant that they should just turn off there mothers system off""

Mother's System... you wish you had my system

""and learn how to write code properly.""

Does this work... yes... put it together in like 5 min

""IF YOU DOWNLOAD THIS YOU GET A KEYLOGGER""
No you won't! Bet me

""FROM ANOTHER FAILED MUTZ.""

And It steals no chars. how can a program crack your Wow chars if u'r searching for a keygen to play? funny. I seed it to other people, and u should make this too. me and my friends play on chronic-domination.servegame.com. its private. thx "

,zero.exe,2007-08-11T09:44Z,"hey, buddies. i mean i really know. i checked this program. its no virus. Fuck off all you noob, who dont know what are saying. how do u know its virus? i checked it with many tools, including Filemon and Regmon, its a simple delphi form. laughingman u'r a good man, plz tell me your server address? thx in advance ;))"
,T3hLaughingMan,2007-08-14T14:08Z,"zero.exe, thanx for vouching for me.. the server is zentoku.servegame.com but there are some hardware complications right now.

To everyone who thinks this is a virus because they ""scanned"" it go to http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3772581/Totally_UD_Virus and scan that

Downloaded 112 times and it's a virus that ""steals characters"" and only 4 people came to ""warn"" you hmmmmm... sounds fishy..."
,Seares,2007-08-23T00:49Z,"thx for the upload havent tried it yet but
I SCANNED IT WITH AVAST AND DID NOT FIND A SINGLE VIRUS

so you morons who says itÂ´s a virus just shutup and go fuck with someone else"
,Red_Knight1979,2007-08-27T01:40Z,"Guys, think about this for a minute. World Of Warcraft is NOT a strategy game. It's an MMO. The key that comes with the game isn't to install. It's to confirm you bought the game. I'd imagine they have computer  records of all valid account keys.

There is no such thing as a key generator for any MMO. People tried passing off a few for Guild Wars too. Interestingly enough, those all required having an account already.

If you see a WoW, City of Heroes, or any other MMO keygen torrent, it's a fake. It's either a virus, a spyware, or just junk."
,Red_Knight1979,2007-08-27T02:02Z,"HA! I created a system restore point, downloaded this, ran three anti-virus programs, then tried running this program. Here's the results.

First, it pops up a screen with a bunch of 0's, two per field. Ok, that right there tells you this is a fake. It says ""get numbers"" on the button. Once again, proof it's fake. And the kicker, clicking the button creates a pop-up window. here's some of what it says.

""You are an idiot for downloading this and if I were an A-hole I would have just put a virus on your computer... but I didn't""

Now I'm gonna do a restore just to be save."
,Dj_Drizu,2007-08-28T21:20Z,"why you people would do something to "" teach us a lesson"" is pretty gay. This is a site where people have enough to worry about with viruses we don't need people who think they need to "" educate"" us. I mean come on man..."
,nanokenny,2007-09-19T23:52Z,look you see when you do this do they check your pc for illegal activity.

 no virus or anything"
,T3hLaughingMan,2007-09-25T03:07Z,"OMG i can't believe people are still downloading this... it was just me trying to be funny.

 I wasn't really trying to educate anyone, well maybe, that is if it stopped someone from downloading a virus elsewhere.

I just thought some people would think it was funny.

You can even see how poorly designed it is then you run the generator it says Form4 because i built it in like 5 minutes. 

It was originally a number generator for a lottery thing but I just made an extra form...

""look you see when you do this do they check your pc for illegal activity.""

lol and screw over fellow pirates... NEVER! Beside honestly I don't think I could build something that productive.

""If you see a WoW, City of Heroes, or any other MMO keygen torrent, it's a fake. It's either a virus, a spyware, or just junk.""

Dont download the torrent and learn the lesson."
,kayori,2012-04-30T01:35Z,"This was amusing, yet incredibly annoying at the same time. I'm referring to the comments, of course. This thing has been scanned by a multitude of Anit-Virus software, and came out clean. So there is no virus threat to your computer. T3hLaughingMan also stated that it was originally an automated number randomizer for ""raffles"", all they did was add an extra field. So there is no ""account information stealing"" threats either, because it never asks for it.

And for those who comment, ""OmG this is grate I use code it give and work."" They're bullshitting you. It does not even give a code, all it does is say ""Hey, guess what? You're a fucking moron, and I could have made it a virus, but I like staying outside of bars.""
There is no such thing as a CD Key Generator. It has never happened, will never happen, and should never happen. Why? Because, yeah the keys they make are random numbers, but the chances of actually making a working Key illegitimately, is basically the chance of winning the lottery. I'm not talking the, ""only 1,000,000 people have entered"" kind it's more like 10,000,000,000. Besides, most people who win the lottery go bankrupt because they don't know how to manage money properly. So, if by an odd stroke of the stupidity we call ""luck"" you happen to make a code that works, and you get your ""free game"", chances are you'll be like ""Damn I forget it have monthly fees"".

Also, as a side note to foreign players, who stated that the price was higher in their country versus the U.S, if your country uses PayPal, you can purchase a digital cd key via the WoW main web site. PayPal automatically takes the USD price and calculates to your currency. If you don't have a credit card, simply ask your parents if you can use theirs, and give them the money. The only reason the game is so expensive in your country is this. It's imported. Simple as that. That and the differences in currency. 
I used to work in a CVS in Las Vegas where we would get people from all over the world. I once had a man from Germany buy every. single. stick. of a certain deodorant because it was only about $3. He wound up buying like, 13 of the damn things (We even had to look in the stock room). I had a man from England tell me that a box of Lucky Charms were really expensive back home. They were about $4.49 in the store at the time. He bought 6 boxes. I also had a lady (forgot where she was from) buy 6 cartons of Marlboro cigarettes. That's around $200 on cancer sticks of death, simply because they were less expensive than ""back home"", and the airport. (Note: Never buy anything from an airport, especially cigarettes.)

Honestly, if you don't even have money and your looking to get this game for free, you are wasting your time. I'm not joking. If your parents will not pay for the game for you, then don't bother with it at all. The monthly fee is $15 US. 
The free trail says it lasts ""10 days"" but it cuts you off at level 20, and you can only make one character with a trial, I believe. If you start out your game, and you start going and killing things and doing every quest you can possibly find, you hit 20 in less than a day for most.
I say this because only teenagers and children, would actually try to do this get a code free shit. Why? Because quite frankly children have no money, and teenagers might have ""some"" money, but not enough to make a consistent payment on the game. But all-in-all most right-minded parents think that WoW is a waste of life, and so refuse to pay for it."
