,fpsking409,2008-04-10T18:07Z,"SEED PLEASE


For the love of god, 13 gigs with no seeds, if I'm lucky it will finish by '09"
,Beonaam,2008-06-27T10:04Z,"What the hell are you talking about?
That's as good as a rip of a VHS gets buddy. Sorry if you're 5 years old (very likely) and don't know anything except HDTV...

So why don't you just go back to watching porn from the 60's? Seriously, everything here is free. Don't complain if something isn't perfect."
,mix_master21,2008-07-18T00:02Z,B to the U to the R to the N
,hvm,2008-09-13T21:28Z,I don't see any dupes in the filenames. Is the content repeating or what?
,the.herbalist,2008-12-09T17:52Z,Love this show :D
,Kona_,2009-01-28T22:32Z,FUCKING AWESOME
,Gearbox80,2009-01-31T21:55Z,"A huge thank you for uploading this way back when, it's great.  I've seeded to 12.67 ratio, I'll keep seeding until I hit 20 or so to make sure this torrent stays alive.

A note however: the episodes are numbered incorrectly, they are not even close to correct. The episode titles in the guide match the vids, but the seasons and episode numbers do not match how they were released. That is an extremely small price to pay though.  Keep up the good work."
,happy90,2009-04-15T23:46Z,SEEEEEEEEEEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,Tradochmjolk,2009-10-05T03:27Z,PLEASE SEEEED :(
,Greenagoo,2009-11-10T08:42Z,"Does it have the ever elusive ""Dexter's Rude Removal"" episode? If not I won't bother"
,McGinty94,2010-01-03T04:20Z,Why is every episode the same size? 174mb???
,ThePalindorme,2010-04-05T07:45Z,half hour tv rips?
,JadeBoy,2010-05-14T09:00Z,"Motherfuckers, I'm not gonna seed if no one does.

Currently 107 seeds and over 1100 leechers, the number of seeds never increases and leechers keep increasing.

Go fuck your moms."
,King.Ironix,2010-06-16T22:46Z,"Quality is just fine for me, it's clear enough to watch and bring some good memories.

I uploaded many pepper ann episodes on my page, about 40 episodes. Check it out"
,tuskengod,2010-09-17T07:42Z,"Man, this quality is better than what it was when I was watching it on an analog satellite TV with a pirated decoder card.

Anybody complaining about the quality can just stuff it, this shit was made back when this kind of quality was high-end.

Lots of good memories here, a big thank you to the guy who did the task of encoding and gathering these episodes, even if you could've done a little bit of a better job organizing them. ;P"
,KGN-004,2011-09-04T02:21Z,"I'd say audio and video would rate between 2~4. It's pretty terrible. Old snowy damaged TV VHS recordings. Currently you can find every one of these episodes in much better quality elsewhere on the internet (with the same or smaller file size, too)."
,KGN-004,2011-09-04T05:21Z,"Actually, I haven't been able to find any better versions of episodes 14~39 of Season 2. But that's it. Hopefully that DVD release comes soon."
,Amazo_Etrigan,2011-10-07T17:41Z,"i don't care about the quality, i appreciate your efforts in making this torrent radawaysp, only fair thing to say is THANKS !!!"
,vinambrudu,2011-10-09T17:46Z,Thank you
,[Silvers],2011-10-14T22:27Z,"To anyone thinking this is bad quality: ""Go back in your hole and die fuckers!""
Seriously, all you care about is HD pixels, if you don't like it, don't download...

Its free, be grateful for what you get. Back in the day this was the best thing for us children, classic cartoons not random anime-franchises...."
,kleptoscope,2011-11-19T07:14Z,Thanks a bunch dude :) you have made my day!
[V],sidbizkit,2011-12-26T06:18Z,can anyone please upload the heidi cartoon series
,Harry Q Hammer,2012-03-25T10:51Z,"Whinge, whinge, whinge...

And most of what you whingers have said is wrong, as per usual!"
