,puttebÃ¤pa,2007-07-25T17:23Z,"Why two rebuilt files of R16 ?
Which one is correct?"
,Bernhard,2007-07-25T18:38Z,It is .r16 I dont remember which one is correct.  Test and post here if you find the right one :\
,puttebÃ¤pa,2007-07-25T19:31Z,"None of the rebuilt .r16 passed Winrar test.
It seems like ""5thelement-classic.r16"" is the correct file."

,sixtensson,2007-11-13T18:20Z,when i download it peaks at about 20 kb/s and the average speed of the swarm is 150 kbs+. how come? i havn't encountered this problem  before.
,barapa,2008-01-30T10:28Z,I have tried r16 using The Unarchiver and it just never finishes unraring. Does anyone know how to open this file properly?
,Raghner1,2008-03-28T14:05Z,"Yes, just extract all files except the rebuilt files. It worked for me. I still wonder why it says incomplete download in Azureus..."
