  | Two hundred and fifty years in the future, life as we know it is       |
  | threatened by the arrival of Evil. Only the fifth element              |
  | (played by Milla Jovovich) can stop the Evil from extinguishing life,  |
  | as it tries to do every five thousand years. She is helped by          |
  | ex-soldier, current-cab-driver, Corben Dallas (played by Bruce Willis),|
  | who is, in turn, helped by Prince/Arsenio clone, Ruby Rhod.            |
  | Unfortunately, Evil is being assisted by Mr. Zorg (Gary Oldman), who   |
  | seeks to profit from the chaos that Evil will bring, and his alien     |
  | mercenaries.                                                           |
