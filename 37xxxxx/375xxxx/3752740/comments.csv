,MisterBB,2007-10-22T22:01Z,Thanks dude
,plasmafox2038,2008-08-22T17:28Z,I had to stop downloading for a half a day and now the seed is gone. Come back for a bit so  I can get this last 10% and I'll seed from there.
,plasmafox2038,2008-08-23T15:36Z,"finished download.

there's a few hundred megabytes of worthwhile stuff for someone new to fur. But I'm not and ended up deleting all but about 15 MB. Still, some good stuff, but mostly common.

About 3 copies of all the drcomet and sexyfur stuff, and about 1.5GB of this isn't even furry- although it does contain an extremely good yuri collection in there."
