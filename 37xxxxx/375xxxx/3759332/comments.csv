,dreamiks,2007-08-02T13:50Z,Is it possible to know what DVD includes what so you don't need to download all the programs? Or is it necessary to have them all to install the software?
,Bachu,2007-08-02T20:22Z,"Hi
This is really awesome dude.
Thanks.

I have a question about it.
Can the dvds work separately?
If they can, where can I find After Effects CS3, cause i´ve been searching for it and couldn´t find it in any torrent site.

Can anyone detail the contents of each DVD

Thanks again"

PLEASE SEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Mine's been running for 84hrs and I've uploaded 47GB but only downloaded 1.88GB and as I'm sure you could imagine......THIS IS FUKIN DRIVING ME APE SHEIT....DAMNIT!!!

While raging in this inferno of fury I read bobtentpeg's comment about both platforms being on the DVD's and based on the fact that while installing the Windows version of CS3 MC which I actually purchased I noticed that NONE of the DVD's were even 50% full, I thought he might be right.  So unless Adobe's trying to hide the other version, bobtentpeg is wrong at least in the case of my DVD's he is....

SERIOUSLY.......PLEASE SEED THIS TORRENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If you've actaully completeted the DL...PLEASE BE A BIG PERSON AND CONTINUE TO SEED IT, at least till there are a few more seeds.....

,Kilven,2007-08-03T23:13Z,"There's only one real seed. me. the others just have a small file like the keygen. It's going at 35 kBps. I calculate 6 days before you have it 100% done.

No one has finished the download! Even if it was running at full speed 100% of the time, it would take a week with my bandwidth.

People seeding 1 or 2 small files tricked my client into thinking it wasn't the only (real) seed so it dropped out of super seeding mode. now it's in forced super seeding and it's going at a more 'correct' speed.

All i can tell you about the dvd contents is that you don't need the video workshop. To install it you need dvd 1. The various programs are spread across 2,3,4, and 'content' but i can't tell you where a specific program is.

bachu: you're using bittorrent mainline? try azureus or transmission.

Any ideas?"

If you're installing it and you get the blank white dialog window when you're asked to switch discs, that's because Safari 3 beta is messing about with it. Uninstall Safari 3 beta before installing. It's included in the Safari 3 installation DMG from the apple site.

The included keygen is a Windows program. It allows for the usual telephone activation key thing.

To those wondering what a hackintosh is, it's an ordinary Intel PC that's running a hacked version of Mac OS X. It seems like these Adobe apps have some conflict with these modded Mac OS Xes, so the included kernel extension (AppleSMBIOS.kext) is supposedly able to take care of this problem.

,dsc106,2008-03-04T21:14Z,"Jaquit013,

Thanks for the help on the repair activation issue. However, this did not solve things for me. When I did this, I did get a fresh activation screen. However, every serial number I input, whether generated from the keygen or that is included in the readme, now gives a red ""X"" ... any idea why? Did this happen for you?

I have uninstalled everything, deleted directories, used adobe cleanscript thing, rebooted in between and repaired permissions. When I reinstall, it asks for a serial and I give it a new one. Yet, everytime I try and run an application, it gives me the same repair activation screen, and I can't generate a repair key. And the method you mentioned, as I said, gives me a fresh activation screen, but no serial number works now...

Any more ideas? I am super frustrated, and don't know what to do, short of wiping my whole system clean and starting from scratch... :("
,ek2000,2008-03-05T00:05Z,got the same shitty problem. Please Help! I Dont want to scratch it up!
,dumb_sheep,2008-03-11T08:47Z,"I am having the same problem.  I have tried reinstalling, using adobe clean sweep program, and more.  You can use a serial from iSerial Reader, but it still won't activate.  Someone please crack this soon...."
,dumb_sheep,2008-03-11T09:04Z,"tried restoring via time machine and still didn't work.  says

Serial Number Needed

The local file on your computer that stores the serial number associated with this installation was deleted.  Please reenter a valid serial number below to continue.
Your serial number is located... blah blah blah"
,anthonyik,2008-03-11T23:29Z,I INSTALLED MASTER COLLECTION AND PUT IN THE WRONG ACTIVATION CODE AND NOW THE LICENSE IS EXPIRED. IS THERE A WAY TO PUT IN A NEW ACTIVATION CODE?
,SoundWall,2008-03-18T20:56Z,"The keygen included (following inculded instructions of installation) does not work! However it does NOT contain any virus or trojan.

Generally Adobe retail software needs to be cracked in order to work, so even with a working keygen chances are it wouldn't work.
SO until someone either cracks or uploads a volume license version of premiere I guess I'm screwed.

Anyone interested in only the design apps, there's a volume license upload of the design premium kit on TPB, tho I can't remember the address."
,artdog,2008-03-20T15:13Z,"Did it ever occur to anyone that it is very easy to find this torrent page using Google? Buy writing here about your problems installing or registering the pirated software, you are given the maker clues how to prevent you from pirating future versions.

Maybe you should try posting on a board that does not open its posts to google so that Adobe won't be reading everything you write.

The more you post about registration problems and solutions, the easier it is for the software maker to plug the holes that are discovered."
,secretshan,2008-03-21T08:34Z,"Found the solution to the repair activation issue.

Navigate to the Library/Preferences/FLEXnet Publisher/FLEXnet folder

Delete everything inside, empty the trash.

Launch again, use keygen.exe per the original instructions."
,indianajonathan,2008-03-27T04:24Z,"still not fixed...tried the flexnet and the .xml file edit and neither works.  i don't have the time or the patience to go through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling everything unless I know for SURE that it will work.  Has anyone had ANY luck fixing this ""repair activation"" issue?"
,kurten16,2008-04-02T08:41Z,getting frustrated with this stupid reactivation thing... no solution?
,DrewDodson89,2008-04-09T10:29Z,"Everyone, make sure you are using th CD key in the TXT file for the initial install, then use the keygen for the activation."
,DrewDodson89,2008-04-09T10:30Z,"It is in the file called ""Readme.txt""

Try reading the readme next time."

,cucker,2008-04-24T18:40Z,I've lost the readme and the keygen but still have the DVDs for installation. Does anybody knows where can I find the keygen and readme separatly so I don't have to download the complete 16GB torrent just for a couple of bytes I stupidly lost? Thanks a lot
,arl1ngton,2008-05-02T17:24Z,"Thanks to secretshan mine doesnt ask for reactivation anymore, Thanks so much dude!"

,calandrinon,2008-05-18T12:24Z,"I've got to 99.99% download done already but it keeps giving me ""Unspecified I/O error"" and the download stops...Does anyone know what could be the reason for this? Looking at the comments list it seems like the file should be ok, it's been successfuly downloaded by others but then why it get to this troubleshooting in my case I'm wondering. Any suggestion would be most appreciated."
,calandrinon,2008-05-18T12:37Z,"The download status has droped down from 99.99% to 99.87%. LOL! It's absolutely weird...Has anyone got this problem yet? It's almost done but it's got stock to that point...going up and down like that, seems like download never ending. Please help!"
,CrankyBird,2008-05-28T11:47Z,"Hi,

Please tell what this is for. Adobe says that the serials etc. for Mac's are NOT the same as for PC's.
Will this work on a Mac Intel Leopard running OS 10.5.2?
The virus's listed below are for PC's. SO is this for mac's or not?

Also I would ask / beg for a download of just the serials, activation keygen. 
Some of us have the programs from dl already and dl this monster will take me months.
Olease, please, please even if this isn't for mac's make a dl that is just the needed part that one can't get anywhere else.
Thanks so very much!
I'll ck back for new posts."

,0399e,2008-06-18T20:54Z,does this work on mac leopard
,mmmdonuts86,2008-09-05T22:47Z,are you not supposed to run any updates after you install this? what happens if you do? will it ask for activation?
,gbdroot,2008-09-08T23:03Z,"FOR reactivation issue:
Go to %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Application Data\FLEXnet
(c:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\FLEXnet\)
and rename the adobe_*_tsf.data file (Adobe apps must not be running)

After that, when You start an Adobe app You will then see a registration window where You could enter Your new legit registration data."
