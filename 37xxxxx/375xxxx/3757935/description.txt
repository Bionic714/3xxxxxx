Little Britain is a character-based sketch show first appearing on BBC radio and then television. It is written by and stars Matt Lucas and David Walliams, and relies largely on simplistic caricatures and heavy use of catch-phrases. Its title is an amalgamation of the terms 'Little England' and 'Great Britain', and is also the name of a Victorian neighbourhood and modern street in London [1]. An American version of the series will be made for HBO by Lucas and Walliams in 2007.

Many of the characters on the show have their own often-repeated catchphrases. Many have become well-known in the United Kingdom, and the show has gained a mainstream following.
