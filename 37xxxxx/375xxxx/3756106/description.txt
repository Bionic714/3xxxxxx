A brilliant complete sessions box for a brilliant album. I've included all the tracks from this 4-CD box in perfect 320kb/s resolution mp3 files. Enjoy.

Just not made for these times? Then this four-disc monument to the most innocent, blissfully melodic, California-dreamin' album of the rock era beats Prozac hands down. A staggering labour of love on the part of executive project director Phil Sandhaus and his fellow disciples, this lets us ponder the sine qua non of Brian Wilson's career from every imaginable angle--stereo, mono, instrumental and celestial vocals-only versions included. It's way too much of a good thing, but any album that can profoundly influence such disparate talents as Paul McCartney, XTC's Andy Partrige and ex-Pixie FrankBlack warrants microscopic analysis. Our advice: don't worry baby, just drift away on a Brian Wilson fantasia from an epoch when the drugs still worked and before the delirium tremors set in.
