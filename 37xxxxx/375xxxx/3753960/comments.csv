,Ryanmm2,2008-02-24T15:43Z,"Either you try to find a crack for version 1.01, or don't update and download the 1.00 crack, you place the crack where the .EXE file of the same name is, and choose copy and replace.

,De_loused,2009-12-09T22:46Z,"Hi... I'm not a noob of torrents I use pretty much all the tools available and have my drivers updated as well as Service pack 3 for XP...

when I run this, it loads properly but then it crashes after 2-3 minutes and i have no log of it...

HW1 works fine but its a cracked version... anyone care to enlighten me on whats the problem?"
,Fluffy283,2011-11-09T03:49Z,"I downloaded this torrent and didn't use the patch because it isn't cracked. But I can  only get 2 or 3 clicks in [and that's if I'm lucky] before it crashes. The only message I get is ""cataclysm.exe has stopped working"". Then it takes a couple minutes to finish closing down. Should I install the patch and get a crack?"
