Die Dritte Generation, The Third Generation, A Terceira Geração

Rainer Werner Fassbinder, 1979


Highly controversial film made during the 2nd Generation of the violent left-wing West German group, Red Army Faction, speculates on what lay behind increased security and domestic terrorism in Germany. The first third of the movie plays as a comedy of the inside shenanigans of how such a group would behave. The movie's tone turns grim and critical when the group playfully kills a low-level banker in a robbery. Especially controversial was the fictional film's showing cooperation between German terrorists and industrialists. Fassbinder premiered the movie at Cannes, 1 month before the real RAF tried to assassinate NATO head Alexander Haig. At a later showing at a German film festival, outraged audience members stormed the projection booth and stopped the film.
