Return with us now to the thrilling days of yesteryear, when Hollywood could make twenty films in a row that not only didn't suck, but were great, and played them on screens bigger than two-story buildings. Movies HAD to be good back then, because TV re-runs and DVDs were far-off future fantasies. Ticket sales were 100% of the income.

Erich Wolfgang Korngold is notable for scoring some of the most famous epic drama and adventure films, and Errol Flynn and sailing pictures in particular.
