,Flebbo,2007-07-26T20:12Z,"why the hell is it in rar?
Anyone who downloaded it yet? Is it ok?"
,larslane,2007-07-26T23:51Z,probably got a virus or a password
,digitalx,2007-07-27T00:59Z,"All my files are in rar format, other torrent sites require all files to be that format, so I thought this was the same, and no it has no virus nor a password."
,digitalx,2007-07-27T04:05Z,"Listen I did'nt come on here to be lectured and bitched at, I am sharing content, that is malware free, virus free and not passworded, if you don't like them in rar format don't dl them, lots of others are dl'in and have zero complaints, I just started a week ago and already have close to 2000 dl's of my stuff."
,tbjerret,2007-07-27T09:51Z,"No, maybe not, but it's a nice lesson for the rest of us. And thank you."
,flawforewer,2007-07-27T13:31Z,"Great upploads....
Keep you stand against those complainers....
No body forces them to download, not even to
unpack....
Keep up the good work:)"
,Bjurran,2007-09-18T23:20Z,"Haven't downloaded, but have to agree with others that there's no idea of putting videos or mp3s in rar (or zip) as it's already compressed. It will only cause less seeders as everyone who download will have to unpack files, and end up using atleast twice as much disk space, and they'll probably delete the compressed one. Upload it uncompressed and you'll have more seeders... anyhow, I'll check to see if worth seeding..."
,laconga,2008-01-11T05:07Z,"So...all of u complained, but no one said what we want to know, is the movie worth the download?"
,dental1,2008-04-27T18:34Z,"its ok ,use winrar to open its pretty hot"
,zoot77,2008-05-31T12:23Z,"Bitch and moan, is that all commentators know how to do anymore? Manners don't cost you a penny to use. And I would guess they're probably appreciated by the people who share their content.

Thanks for the upload digitalx. 

To all the complainers may you slip and break your dick on your keyboard tray, and crash your head into your monitor, the next time you have to nerve to complain about any torrent anywhere. May all the fast food employees, that you also treat like garbage, fill your food with bile, snot, blood, mucus, sperm, and what the hell, poo too.

I find it amazing how much more useful, and technologically advanced the net has become, since I started regularly using it, in 1995. Yet somehow the more advanced, or perhaps smarter then web becomes, that average user is inversely becoming that much more rude, and stupid. It's as if all of those original AOL users came forth, and started inbreeding with one another to fill 75% to 90% percent of the current Internet population.

I don't understand the cause. Perhaps the general population were already retarded jackasses, and I was less aware of it. Because they just hadn't found the web yet, to treat like a gas station bathroom, next to the bar after closing time.

This last little bit here is for that 75% to 90% percent I mentioned. I know you don't realize who you are, and that makes me sad, heh.

I'll even make it all caps so you can understand it.

YOU  CAN  USE  THE  INTERNET  TO  GET  SMART

Thanks digitalx

porn doesn't make you stupid, stupidity makes you stupid"
,Hooligan-Hogan,2008-06-12T02:48Z,"Hey Zoot77...If I want to hear an a**hole, I'll fart!!"
,Jonlissla,2009-04-13T15:20Z,"Clean working torrent. No virus or shit.

Actually, I was rather surprised at the quality of the video, since it's all HD-or-whatever-it-is-called. It's made by actors and all that, so it's definately not any real rape scene. Really well played though. Kudos for uploading."
,theinsanebuttercup,2011-01-04T05:07Z,"If you're too much of a pussy to just unrar a file, why are you using the internet lmao Like half my files are rar files that I end up downloading, especially games. 
Thanks for the upload :D"
,ducosme,2011-02-20T20:26Z,i do not download rar files.
,themanjimwalker,2011-02-22T10:56Z,"I signed up just to tell you people complaining about a rar to shut the hell up. All you do is right click and extract. You have a torrent program, you surf the net and DL torrents from piratebay, but youre too much of a newb to right click the file after download? shut up, download the file, and deal with it.  Thanks Digitalx!"
