ALLA ORD SOM STÅR I '' TECKEN KAN VARA SVÅRA ATT FÖRSTÅ. FÖR ATT UNDERLÄTTA FINNS DET
EN HJÄLP FIL I MAPPEN SOM FÖRKLARA ALLA ORD!

DU MÅSTE INSTALLERA SPELET I FÖLJANDE ORDNING!


1. 'Mounta' filen som heter ""Lord of the rings Battle for middle earth [Disk]"" med Daemon tools eller
liknande program.

2. Installera Spelet, när du gör de kommer du behöva en CD-Key! Den får du genom att generera en
i 'Key-gen' programmet som ligger i 'Key-gen' mappen.

3. 'Cracka' spelet genom att kopiera filerna som ligger i Crack mappen och klistra in
dom i den mappen du installerade spelet, till exempel C:\Program\Electric arts\Battle for middle earth.

4. Spela! :)
sorry for the ignorance and long post."

,CoolyPBLS29,2011-01-12T17:22Z,Works great. Thanks so much. This is the best game. The best torrent as well.
,OhLookPineapples,2011-03-16T09:28Z,"The download and torrent was GREAT. But, when I mount it with PowerISO (with the game.dat) it still asks me to insert disk.
So after a while I coppied it all onto a disk (with a real game.dat) and it asks me to insert ""Disk 1""
Help? This is the first time a no disk crack hasn't worked for me so yeah..."

,mattgalvin11,2012-05-02T02:38Z,Help- I followed all the steps and during installation the game won't install past 53% what should I do?
,mattgalvin11,2012-05-02T02:40Z,The game is stuck at 53% during installation. What should I do?
,argygreen,2012-05-05T22:31Z,"@renovtio86
I used an iso editor and created an empty file at the path missing.
e.g.:""error cant find file folder/example.something""
go to the iso editor and create file in the folder with name 
example.something. then reinstall
if u have any broblem tell me"
,argygreen,2012-05-05T22:33Z,"Oh and to specify this you just have to create
a file named lasmig.txt
in the Supportsv folder.leave it empty.
(i think daemon tools dont let u edit the iso so download magiciso to be sure.)"
