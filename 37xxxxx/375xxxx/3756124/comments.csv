Leechers:

Something wrong here?? IF YOU DONT SEED YOU GET THIS FILE SLOW AS SHIT BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE WILL SEED BECAUSE THEY DONT HAVE IT.

,TinyGrunt,2007-07-29T00:41Z,"If you've watched this movie, don't download it, bart tells you not to!"
,hn11,2007-07-29T01:07Z,Why can't I connect to any seeders? What the hell?!
,hjorten1,2007-07-29T01:11Z,Seeed plz..
,Big JN,2007-07-29T01:25Z,This looks fake too fucking assholes!!!!
,termin8or123,2007-07-29T01:30Z,"Big JN, this is in-fact the real deal. But this has worse video, and audio quality than the The.Simpsons.Movie.TS.XViD-mVs. The only thing this version does better is no overcropping. BUT the mVs version isn't that bad of cropping. Just a little chopped off at the bottom. Go grab the mVs version... Much better... Sorry greenthumbz2 "
,_xXmartinXx_,2007-07-29T01:34Z,"Why does the info file say that this is the movie""Evan Almighty"" ?????"
,lovellyvee,2007-07-29T01:36Z,"greenthumbz2 when you upload a file, seed it at least 3 days so enough poeple gets the file. 
the 15 or so people who 
dl this file is not seeding!"
,Kidnice,2007-07-29T01:39Z,Yoo  Stop  complaining  dammit! and  download it   then say if its fake  or not   if U have not download it STFU!!! Dam... 
,hn11,2007-07-29T01:53Z,SEED! My speed is not even 1kB/s and I have 0 seeds connected. WTF!
,Kratier,2007-07-29T02:00Z,it says 12 seeds but wont let me connect to any of them.
,andythecurefan,2007-07-29T02:47Z,Sample looked good. I'm going to stick with this one and I'll let you guys know after it's done.
,andythecurefan,2007-07-29T03:07Z,"Sample here:

,nimq,2007-07-29T03:25Z,"I'm connected to 3 seeds and my speed has been a constant 140kbs, I'm quite happy, its moving quite quickly...
Trick is to allow many more connections than usual...
Enjoy..."
,cragllo,2007-07-29T05:03Z,"Not a telecine, it's a crappy telesync,  get the mVs TS. Much better."
,Zepski,2007-07-29T06:27Z,"Only problem i saw with the movie was that the 2 times the animals speak it is in german subtitles but  i'm not complaining

other wise 
Video 9
Audio 7 (what ya expect from mono)"
,termin8or123,2007-07-29T06:32Z,"Zepski... It's worse quality dude. Even if mVs cut off some of the bottom... mVs has better audio, and video. Even tho it's a tad bit dark, its better all n all. So yea, and soon a Proper will come out soon. Either by PUKKA, or 20th... So these wont even matter. But yea mVs is the best version out."
,Zepski,2007-07-29T07:47Z,"dude i downloaded both the mvs one is shit! i mean sure if you want 1 guys hair at the bottom left (at about 31 minutes to 35 minutes) in and some other dudes head in the bottom (at 34 to 42 minutes in and again at 53) right although its funny since its shaped like homers head.

and thats only from flipping through the movie!

This copy doesn't have any heads and quality is very very watchable."
,Big JN,2007-07-29T08:44Z,"I would like to say that I'm sorry greenthumps2!
This is the real deal and you rule thanks for the upload!!!!
Once moore I'm sorry!!!"
,greenthumbz2,2007-07-29T09:43Z,lovellyvee   please dont tell me how to seed thank you !
,greenthumbz2,2007-07-29T11:56Z,sorry i put in the wrong nfo too 
,krunck,2007-07-29T11:59Z,"The file is good, this IS the movie... The speed is good, took me 15 mins to dl...

The movie is kinda boring though"
,Macoco,2007-07-29T12:26Z,hoho it's telecine! :D
,ninjauk,2007-07-29T16:29Z,"will someone please seed, i'm getting speeds of 0.2kbs"
,termin8or123,2007-07-29T18:33Z,"get the NEW PUKKA RELEASE!!! Much better!! Better than this, and better than mVs!!"
