This video explores the lies, propaganda, and twists of truth perpetuated in the corporate media on just one day -- August 21st, 2003.

On that day, corporate mouthpieces dispensed inaccurate and falsified accounts of the anti-bush protest in Portland. You get to see what they say happened, and then what REALLY happened. It's hard to believe unless you see for yourself how far the corporate media will go to twist the truth and discredit The People.
