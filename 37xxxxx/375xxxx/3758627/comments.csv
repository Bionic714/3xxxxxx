,ThePalindorme,2010-06-04T19:19Z,you can convert any pal to ntsc or ntsc to pal. Search google for a software. Youll just need to burn it again. I just hope it works
,kristov1,2010-07-06T10:49Z,"It is working for me, burned iso with imgburn at 2x speed. If you have a modchip ps2 then it doesn't matter if its ntsc or pal.

,bablu4195,2011-05-06T12:12Z,does it works on ps2 emulator or not
,dothackjhe,2011-06-05T02:55Z,"Contrary to what sebec said, this is the original God of War and not God of War 2. Apparently this ISO has been converted to NTSC from PAL as evidenced by low quality visual effects in-game. 

As for the PS2 emulators, it should work but not 100% similar as that of PS2's capabilities provided the computer emulating the console is beefy enough to process it. "
,dothackjhe,2011-06-08T02:31Z,It is PAL converted to NTSC. My saved file once in NTSC doesn't load in this game. 
,niltonnunes@intra.co.mz,2011-06-21T00:12Z,"Gotta wonder again...i want GOW 2!
Which one,once again.which one is this?
Damn it.
Should one waste time downloading it to find out it's not the one needed."
,levieira.automacao,2011-07-27T13:18Z,"This is God of War 2 ?
Thanks all!"
,SkyClap,2011-08-13T04:53Z,"Don't download it, it's in spanish :/"
,SkyClap,2011-08-13T05:55Z,":s  sorry, my bad it's in english also

 I just realize that changing your language in the ps2 options (I had it in spanish) adjust also this game language.

 I have a ps2 for almost 5 years now and never figured that out LOL

 But again why don't just put a language selection in the game menu :x"
,SkyClap,2011-08-13T06:24Z,"The treasure menu(bonus content menu) is screwed up, though"
