OK fuckhead.....yeah they do have 8 cds but if you do your fuckin reasearch dickwad you'll find that two of them ""Bowling For Soup"" and ""Cell Mates"" are rare cd's that were realeased before the band were signed. And both of them were limited to 1000 copies. Check your fuckin' facts before you go givin' people shit....dumb asshole"

'Love Sick Stomachache' from The Great Burrito Extortion Case.

Otherwise it's a great torrent"
