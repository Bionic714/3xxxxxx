,svensk_huvudverk,2007-08-01T17:41Z,"""Janes USAF"" orginal cd????
greate torrent by the way!!"
,slickerick,2007-08-01T18:53Z,"Janes USAF. I was released around 1999 and will work on XP. You will need the original CDs of which there are two. If you look around, they are available either for sale or, well you know. "
,svensk_huvudverk,2007-08-01T23:23Z,"thanks allot man,,,,"
,leenathan,2007-08-04T16:52Z,"Let's clear this up.  

This is a mod.  You need to install the original USAF game content before using Super Pro. "
,kontakos,2007-09-24T08:37Z,"Yes great mod,

for more info read the review at http://www.simhq.com/_air8/air_278a.html"
,slickerick,2008-02-03T23:40Z,I want to thank the seeders. Never dreamed it would last this long.
,slickerick,2008-02-10T19:08Z,Much better than going to the certain unnamed site that charges you to download this.
,slickerick,2008-02-26T22:32Z,Actually if you want it bad enough go to Gulf Knights website. I think the guy charges you by the day for downloads. LMAO..laughing my ass off. LOL
,slinky317,2008-04-12T18:52Z,"Seriously.  No site should ever charge for downloads, especially for free mods, fixes, etc that are designed for the good of the community in mind.  Hell, even sites like Fileplanet offer a free download plan in addition to their paid plan.  Information is free - let it stay that way."
,badroz_2008,2008-04-20T22:30Z,"thx so much slickerick ,fuck gulfknight ,the world is poor enough to pay for a game's ""mod"" !
 i am not seeding usually due to my bad upload speed 6 Kbs,  but for this one i am going to seed until everyone is done , & i'll try to re-upload it in an alternative http mirrors & post it here .

peace"
,slickerick,2008-04-21T01:23Z,"Thanks badroz. I'm still seeding this sucker, Maybe not always but don't worry, I'm at about 25GB since I started this and many more have seeded it. If there are no seeds, I always come back. And screw GK too.  "
,badroz_2008,2008-04-22T02:56Z,"i seeded until the two guys at me were finished , now i dont exactly know what 2 do with the files , i installed original USAF than the Patch everything just as written and ..  crashed , no luck !!

is there is any problem with gforce 8xxx series ?"
,slickerick,2008-04-26T08:14Z,"Yeah, I think some of the newer Gforce card drivers may have a problem with it. You have to install it to the default location or it will absolutely not work. Right now, I've seeded more than 30Gb on my original upload so if you can. please try to install again. If you are running Vista, I've heard it works perfectly too. I'm running XP home and it works perfect here."
,troglodyte,2008-12-21T00:10Z,"I loved USAF and played on HyperLobby allot back in the day. I still have the original Jane's Air Superiority Collection with USAF, IAF, and F-15 in mint conditon. oh, by the way I need some upload I'm hanging around 68%"
,slickerick,2008-12-23T22:54Z,"Wow, this thing is still being seeded 14 months after I originally uploaded it. "
,oxygene35,2009-04-05T16:38Z,"plese seed this torrent, tks a lot for reading
/oxygene"
,slickerick,2009-06-17T00:11Z,"Thanks for seeding this. Still alive after nearly two years.

Fuck Gulfnight and all his cronies and fanboys."
,slickerick,2010-08-25T04:49Z,Three years!
,slickerick,2011-07-17T17:38Z,Soon to be four years.
