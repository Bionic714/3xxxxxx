,Geprodis,2008-02-19T15:36Z,Thanks for the upload! I would have uploaded this myself but my friend has had my Shiny Happy Jihad CD since a week after I bought it back in the summer! I am impressed by the evolution of Joe's comedy! I hope he doesn't get lazy and puts out another album real soon.

Haven't watched this disc yet but I am a Rogan fan (watch his podcast, watch old comedy footage of him) and he had some funny crap on the Talking Monkeys disc.

Just a headsup."
