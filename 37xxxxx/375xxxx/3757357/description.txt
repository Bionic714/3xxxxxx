Documentary about the rural population who earn their living as coal miners, 
thus helping to keep metallurgic activity going and contributing to the forest devastation 
in South America. This heartbreaking documentary by award-winning producer Nigel Noble 
deserves to be widely seen and discussed. A winner of numerous awards, it examines the 
destruction of the Amazonian rainforest and the exploitation of the impoverished migrant 
workers who turn wood into charcoal for use in the Brazilian pig iron industry. Beautiful 
photography and important film! Something to make sure your children watch as well.
