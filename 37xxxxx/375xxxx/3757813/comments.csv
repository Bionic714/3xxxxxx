,PirateWilmo,2007-08-17T16:59Z,Is there sound or not in this movie?!?! 
,Rechain,2007-08-24T20:17Z,"Yes, there is sound in this version :D 5.1 Dolby Digital (english) - I have no problems (burn with Nero)

/Rechain"
,woodis,2007-08-25T18:49Z,the reason for people not getting any sound in this movie (and alot of other movies actually) is that it's 5.1 surround-sound. Played in a comp or a tv or something without surround makes most of the sound mute or very low. my tip is: get a version without 5.1
,Timbaver,2007-08-25T20:57Z,"Woodis already told this:Yes there is a fine  5.1 sound track (about 250 MB's). Here's how I did the job: Unpacked with WinRar (just click the first file), burned by DVDShrink 3.2. I think other burner softwares work as well. Riznasir, shut the fuck up before getting things clear, Mr. Madsen, thank you for pro-quality upload! Keep up good job!!!"
