This seems to be just the trial version that can be downloadad at www.rfactor.net.

Does anybody have a working serial/patch?"

,shareitnow,2007-08-06T20:07Z,"Corrupted? That cannot be, I have used it myself several times. But yes, there is no cracks in this torrent. Search elsewhere if you do not want to buy this excellent racing game."
,ten155,2007-08-06T20:46Z,"the patch doesn't install.
it says: rfactor don't installed, install the game and run this patch again."
