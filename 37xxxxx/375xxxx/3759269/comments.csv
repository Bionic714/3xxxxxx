Jesus was not of estetic beauty and if you read the new testament you'll find out that men including Jesus did not have long hair. But as you say you're not a christian(So why say Yaweh Blessed you and all that) so you probably don't read the Bible. Freak is not a nice word no matter the context. I guess you are still asleep....."
