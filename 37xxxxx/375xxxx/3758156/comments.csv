,Agrippa,2007-07-31T17:48Z,"Downloaded, but never got hear them as they all require a license.  Waste of bandwidth really."
,micros43,2007-07-31T22:36Z,"Ooops, A little mistake.. Going to fix it now... Please wait a bit..."
,micros43,2007-07-31T22:46Z,"UPDATE, PLEASE READ:

When it asking for license you type:

Username: Micros43

Password: 123456

And select the first alternative you get. You can now use it.. "
,Agrippa,2007-08-01T00:24Z,"Thanks for that mate, but it's still a no go.  The license manager asks for an e-mail and a pw, not a user name.  How about re-upping this as MP3s instead, to avoid all the licensing bullcrap?"
,lovetoseed,2007-08-01T07:09Z,"ye i aint wasting my time, if it was .mp3 i would seed it for a while after downloading, since bandwidth aint a probem"
