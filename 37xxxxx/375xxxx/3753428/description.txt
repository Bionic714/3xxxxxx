CDEW is a cross-platform CD/DVD creator, manipulator and mounter (something, like win$hit's Daemon Tools combined with UltraISO, or PowerISO). The win actual release version is 2.0 build 67. Don't know which version is this Linux variant, coz I don't tested yet (only the win variant build 67, which works just fine). Guess that is at least 2.0.65, just becoz I've included here the WIN32 keygen for it (to be used with wine, or under win) and the serial for the 67 build. I'm looking forward to finding the exact matching crack for this one. When I'll find it will post it here. Thanks for the patience. Anyways... enjoy it, guys!
