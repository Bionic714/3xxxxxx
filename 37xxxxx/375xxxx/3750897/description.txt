Ocmulgee
There are mysteries here.

Almost 1000 years ago, Ocmulgee became one of the first large ceremonial centers of the ancient civilization. Compulsive builders, the Mississippians constructed great cities and thousands of mounds. For hundreds of years, they dominated almost half of ANCIENT AMERICA.

Deep within Ocmulgee's smoke-filled earthlodge, chief, council members and ceremonial leaders sat around the central fire: an eagle effigy molded into the earthen floor at their feet.

What happened here 1000 years ago? Discover the surprising answers... the art and trade networks of the Mississippians... and the Mysteries of the mounds.
