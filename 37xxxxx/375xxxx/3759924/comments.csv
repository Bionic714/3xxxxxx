1) Get a real web browser. 
2) Get BugMeNot

Same thing with ads. Use AdBlock. 

Problem solved. I love all the whiners who complain about ads. Hell, at least this guys links for screenshots SHOW UP in the description. Easy to deal with. 

In short, to the whiny element of the bit torrenting public: shut the fuck up, learn how and why things work. And don't bitch. The web can be dangerous, and requires a clue if you want to actually make better use of it. 

You sure know how to use ""Write Comment"", how about trying to google for solutions you can do yourself? "
