Yes english is often better than the other but Dammit if you dont like other language just dont liste to them and dont fkin post on torrent that you dont donwload or you dont like... so thats why I declare you the retard of the year

But this one's well traducted and is in fact even better in french because it actually intentionnaly shows how poor are the french translations of english movies. It's a parody and must be taken as such, it's a real classic and one of my favorites movies. I, for one did listen the two versions before posting any comment. And, by the way, could you  please seed this torrent."
