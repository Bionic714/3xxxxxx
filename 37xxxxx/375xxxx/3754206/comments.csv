Please distribute as much as possible, remember...

THE REVOLUTION....IS NOW!"
,Osaka,2007-07-27T17:35Z,"I already downloaded the 2.92 GiB version, which was great... what's the difference with this version? Why is it smaller?

Good torrent anyway.
"
,b6gm6n,2007-07-27T20:49Z,"The difference is the quality...this is the original source DVD plus i doubt you'll have the opening message plus the credits and references at the end of the movie, this is an image of the dvd (nero) with menu"
,b6gm6n,2007-07-27T20:50Z,"I archived the film which reduces the size, original image size is 2.91 gig"
,b6gm6n,2007-07-27T20:52Z,"This isn't the google video then turned DVD, this is the pure source, if possible please seed...it needs to be out there, everywhere.."
,Osaka,2007-07-28T02:44Z,"Wait -- I didn't see that it was a .rar.

Of course the size is smaller. 

I never bothered to check if it was .rar'ed or not... and I just happend to see this again by accident when searching on Torrentz and it said there that it was .rar.

And the version I was talking about IS the official DVD, the same as this one. Not downloaded off Google Video or anything like that.

Here's the one I was talking about: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3750008/

This torrent seems to be the exact same thing, only that it's in a .rar archive... Yeah."

,b6gm6n,2007-07-29T17:09Z,Thanks to the seeders...I'm keeping this alive myself also...I hope you all heard the NEWS about INCOME TAX in the USA... it's working... tell ALL about this message and ask them to find out about the references in this video themselves...
