Is there a solution???  I've tried ""run as administrator,"" wondering if that was the problem... no luck.  Help please!"
,vijayroja,2007-11-21T03:55Z,it shows some  error 
,dogengo,2007-11-30T13:31Z,During install it showed some errors but that is because I selected extra options such as librairies that are not included in the package. Besides that it seems to work well. I'll try to get librairies from somewhere else. THX heavynetal2007

Also getting the ""Please insert the disk: Revit Architecture 2008 DVD"" dialog after successfully installing the DWF Viewer.

Doing everything as said in the install.txt file (inside ""crack"" folder):

""Install Autocad Revit Architecture 2008 (launch setup.exe)
   Click on Configure (after accepting license agreement ..)
   Select as Default Units: Metric "
,brunotvrs,2009-02-16T15:42Z,"The drive label is ""200709130919"", which I suspect to be the date the iso was made: September 13th, 2007 @ 09:19 am.

Ok, fine. Maybe that's something that makes the setup run weird? O.o

Just wondering..."
,brunotvrs,2009-02-16T15:54Z,"####SOLUTION####

Found @ torrentz (solution by mauddib) in my own words:

The secret is that you MUST copy all the files inside the .iso (either by usind a WinRAR-like app or by mounting it with MagicISO/Daemon Tools and copying the files normally) to a folder inside your hard disk (a desktop folder called ""revit"", for example).

Then you should run the setup.exe and it won't ask for the DVD :)"
