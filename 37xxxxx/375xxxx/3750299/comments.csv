,goingape,2007-07-27T07:39Z,"God bless you, lilneelix.  I've been looking for a high rez video of ""Special"" for so long...  one of the top 20 coolest videos of all time, IMHO.

For anyone downloading this, all of the videos are high quality and generally free of video compression artifacts even at full screen.

I was only a fan of this particular video when I downloaded this.  I'm quickly becoming a fan of Garbage."
,lilneelix,2007-07-27T07:54Z,"de nada. I glad you like! Look for at my other torrents. Jennifer L贸pez ""The Reel Me"" y Tori Amos ""Fade to Red"". HQ video."
,bonkeman,2007-07-27T09:47Z,"Thanks! This is gold!

Garbage's first two albums were fantastic!"
,LikeSuicide,2007-08-06T02:00Z,"How about the ""Thanks for your UUuuhhhh Support "" documentary? Do you have it?"
