This is Gwen Stefani complete concert series, both her tours; Harajuku Lovers Live(2005) and The Sweet Escape(2007).
Harajuku Lovers Live is sourced from DVD-Audio and The Sweet Escape was recorded by yours truely ;) on a Sony D8 DAT with coresound binurals.
Both are in FLAC format.
I hope everyone that downloads this appreicates Gwen and her Disco-Tetris music as much as i do.
So enjoy as Alice herself takes you down the rabbit hole!
