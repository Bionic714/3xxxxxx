NOD --- BS
This UL --- BS
Looks like he included half of his very old Spanish Windows Folder with a 20KB crack for DF5 - < 5MB total.
Why it got to be an ISO - - - BS"

,tfm_copycat,2008-07-24T15:46Z,"tortus, you're an imbecile.
It's a BART-PE (lightweight, live windows) bootable CD with the deepfreeze crack.
You can't delete DF while being on the windows partition you want to thaw, deepfreeze is well made and will block your attempts, that's why you have to run a live version of windows.

Virus? Probably you're just too stupid to know that many AV detect false positives for cracking software.

ISO? What can be easier than burning this image and booting the CD?

This is a fantastic piece of software and works like a charm. Don't listen to retarded people who can't use a computer like tortus. "

,flakes_,2010-04-06T18:51Z,"Hey Ulises2k thanks for your effort! But i still unable to uninstall/remove DF.
I am using windows 7 x64 and DF Ent.6.62.220.3058.
I burned this image and booted the CD and the DF folders and files still there.
Maybe my DF version is too recent for this torrent"
