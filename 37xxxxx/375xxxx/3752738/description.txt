Catherine Tate's ascension to fame has been rapid but definitely well-
deserved. Her sketch show features an eclectic collection of comedy creations;
from Cockney Nan to the rather outspoken schoolgirl, Lauren, Tate's characters 
are all the more funny because they remind us of people in everyday life. The 
second series of THE CATHERINE TATE SHOW improves upon the foundations laid out 
in the first, proving why the comedienne ranks as one of the funniest people 
currently on television.
