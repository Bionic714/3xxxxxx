Oh well.  I hear there's a video game for the Wii based on Harvey Birdman, so I can relive the experience somewhat with that."
,msodrew,2008-09-12T08:02Z,"although the demise of the show is probably partially related to Stephen Colbert's success elsewhere, its sad to see this show end.

It was one of adult swim's best offerings... cheers."
