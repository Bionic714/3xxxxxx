This torrent was released July 22, 2007

This game is full, but doesn't include the interviews and other extras that came on another disk.

This game is the sequel to Star Trek 25th Anniversary, which you can get here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3748225/Star_Trek_25th_Anniversary_CD_Game_DOSBox

This game is tricky to get working, so I included DOSBox and D.O.G. configuration files. Also, see the LOOKHERE folder.

Unless you want an original install for your authentic PC DOS machine, this is the version to get. Should work on Mac and Linux too.

This is an awesome game, especially if you love the original Trek like I do. It is the sequel to Star Trek: 25th Anniversary, and includes full voiceovers from the original cast! Let's see...William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, James Doohan, Nichelle Nichols, DeForest Kelley, Majel Barrett... 

It's an action adventure game. You get to phaser people (on stun or kill), use the tricorder, etc. You get multiple dialogue choices so Kirk can either be diplomatic or flippant.

A must play for adventure gamers, and works great on the latest DOSBox 0.70 and Windows XP. DOSBox and D.O.G. configuration files are included. Just extract and move the STRCD folder to C:\.

An Action/Adventure Game in the Original Star Trek Universe

When you run the game you should see the Interplay splash screen followed by the voice of William Shatner, the one and only original Capt. Kirk, narrating the intro.

I tested this Star Trek Judgment Rites Collector's Ed. CD game with DOSBox 0.70 from

using the D.O.G. 1.53 frontend fromon Windows XP.

Enjoy!  :) Seed!
