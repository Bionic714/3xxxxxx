      Release Notes  >>   With "Ithyphallic", the highly acclaimed U.S. death
                          metal outfit has created the most technical and
                          extreme album of all time! Blending their well-known
                          styles of complexe riffing, violent blasts, mean
                          growls from the vault, razor sharp hooks and
                          Egyptian-influenced craftsmanship, Nile and producer
                          Neil Kernon reinvented themselves with an even
                          tighter and more intense atmosphere than ever before.
                          Songs like the thrilling 'Papyrus Containing the
                          Spell to Preserve Its Possessor Against Attacks from
                          He Who is in the Water' (which will be featured with
                          a video clip as well), the devastating 'As He Creates
                          So He Destoys' or the haunting 'Language of the
                          Shadows' outline Nile's supremacy within the present
                          death metal scene and prove to be some of the best
                          extreme metal songs ever been written.

                          Watch out for the guys playing the famous Ozzfest
                          Tour 2007, as Nile and "Ithyphallic" will hit you
                          like a sandstorm from the depths of Sahara!
