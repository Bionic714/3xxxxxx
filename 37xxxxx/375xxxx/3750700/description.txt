Very high quality group WPi brings us a TV rip based documentary, ripped from public television channel SBS. In this ceaselessly fascinating German documentary - an absolute must-see for all armchair war buffs - Hitler?s desire to strike at the heart of America is vividly detailed by contemporary interviews and a remarkable array of rarely seen archival footage, much of it in colour. As far back as 1937 Hitler was shown a full-scale mock-up of an aircraft that could take the war to the US. Like many Messerschmitt designs, the ME 264 (or America Bomber) was way ahead of its time, its primary purpose being to inflict psychological damage on the American war effort.

Adolf Hitler?s megalomania knew no limits: from the very outbreak of war, his strategists were forging plans to attack the USA. The most daring of these involved suicide missions, in which squadrons of German fighter planes would crash into Manhattan?s skyscrapers as living bombs. Large cargo planes would carry small planes over the Atlantic. The fighter planes would then disengage, and their pilots would steer them into the skyscrapers of New York - a 9/11 scenario contemplated half a century earlier.
