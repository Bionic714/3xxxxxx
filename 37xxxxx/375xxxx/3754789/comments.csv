,Triunity,2007-07-27T18:19Z,I downloaded this from methosivanhoe off of this site.  Thank you methosivanhoe and I hope that I am doing this correctly to seed it.   Since I am new to this I am not sure.  So if it is not working please let me know and any suggestions you may have on how to correct what ever I did wrong.  Thank you again.
,millennium5,2007-07-27T21:59Z,Yes it would be nice if you could keep seeding till a few of us have the whole file :) then we can help you seed it on :) thanks for the up dude :)
,millennium5,2007-07-27T22:00Z,the thing is we all together have only 88.1 % of the file so you will nedd to seed the rest for us for this to work :)
