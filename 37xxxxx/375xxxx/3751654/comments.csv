,mrmeskalin,2007-07-25T00:13Z,"Well by the look of it...about 26 + people in the first hour of this torrent being seeded. If you think Carbon is better than MW, your clearly a congenital   retard! 

Help me seed this, everyone knows Most Wanted is currently the best Need for Speed on the PC.

RDCMrT - You are a spastic"
,milanfromhungary,2007-07-25T03:09Z,hi! i need a code! I can't play online!!!
,mrmeskalin,2007-07-25T09:37Z,"If you need a code to play online, you'll need to buy the game! Of course you could always buy it, write down the code then put a big scratch down the disk/s. Then take it back to the shop and get a refund (under UK Trading standard's Law a damaged product is not fit for the purpose it was sold for, therefore you have to be given a refund. By Law!) - No matter what the shops policy!

Then you have a working code and you can play online ! 

Not that I would do that, nor that I condone that sort of behavior.


Remember, Help others by seeding this torrent."
,mrmeskalin,2007-07-25T10:15Z,"Under XP64 you may have Direct X installation issues, however there IS a work around detailed here -

Simply run thew autorun.exe in compatibility mode for either 2000 or ... XP  worked for me on my X64 XP OS !

,mrmeskalin,2007-08-04T11:39Z,"Thanks C0nroy ;)     Noticed that there's only 5 seeds since I shutdown my server, not bad sharing! 

However I'll seed this one for perhaps another week, as there are more than 179 peers connected to this torrent.   

I'll offer up another quality ISO release soon enough .......

Keep the scene strong, FUCK the government!
