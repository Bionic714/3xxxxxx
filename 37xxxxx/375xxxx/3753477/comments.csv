,Dynochem,2007-07-28T06:37Z,Well guys... is there a password or not?
,juneau4321,2007-07-28T15:31Z,It's highly doubtful that there is a password as the rar files look to be the original replica ones.
,Danath,2007-07-30T03:37Z,NO PASSWORD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,Gaijin73,2007-08-01T10:44Z,"If 77 people are seeeding this then they are seeding crap. I only got 3,4 k as the highest download rate on this one. I downloaded the same torrent from leecherslair and I am currently getting 387 k. If the pirate bay doesn't make some rules for seeding, then this website is slowly being killed by leechers."
,russell1nash,2007-08-07T23:51Z,"does it make any sense at all to reup something LOADER already posted???

 Bot or not, Loader gets the job done, and instead of having people split the seeding power of a torrent, we would be all seeding and dloading only one torrent!!!"
,gotr00t,2007-08-28T00:27Z,"thats the thing with this site. its leechers heaven

most people here dont seed back to 1.0 EVER!

even if TPB had ratio tracking it wouldnt stop them.

use newsgroups if you want super fast downloads.

or sign up to one of those indian warez forums that have rapidshare/megaupload/megashares links for all the warez."
