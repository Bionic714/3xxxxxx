,Shenmue_GdA,2007-07-29T12:56Z,"Ah, English hardsubs? =(

Is Softsubs better, isn't?"
[T],clownmonkey,2007-07-29T18:12Z,"Yes - sorry Shenmue; this is my first rip of a subtitled movie, so I screwed up with the subtitles.  I actually did make softsubs, and was surprised to see two sets of subtitles in the file -- I had forgotten to untick something, or something.  Forgive me?"
