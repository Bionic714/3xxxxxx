,MikesSocks,2007-07-25T06:05Z,"Uh, it's a real audio file, not a virus."
,philbongahue,2007-07-25T17:17Z,"This was not uploaded by anyone at RiffTrax.com, it was uploaded by a fan.

That said, it does not contain any viruses.

Tito, since you enjoy discussing RiffTrax so much, I'd like to invite you to visit our forum, where you could have got this info last night:  http://rifftrax.com/smf/"

,Supreme2k,2007-08-03T21:32Z,"This sucks! Not even as creative as the (real) fake Rifftrax of Generations.
The real torrents weren't coming that fast, but this kind of crap will probably piss people off to the point of releasing more Rifftrax torrents."
,NoDancingNotAllowed,2007-08-04T00:23Z,Is that some kind of pussy reverse psychology?
,NoDancingNotAllowed,2007-08-04T00:24Z,It doesn't even cost 3 dollars to buy the fucking thing.
,Supreme2k,2007-08-09T07:49Z,"No. Pussy reverse psychology would be ""No baby, I absolutely DON'T want to bang you! Not even  if you begged.""

I just meant that rifftrax ""torrents"" will go elsewhere. I've already seen (the real) 300 and Bourne available on file hosts.

Just remember that this antagonistic shit is useless. True fans will always buy the trax, and non-fans will torrent (or whatever).
If Rifftrax's fanbase is going to torrent anyway, it's not much of a fanbase. I suspect that it has to be something like the rabid fanboyism of MST3K, so they're in no danger...


...unless someone gets pissed with these fakes and hacks the RT site or something."

mikessocks should be banned "
