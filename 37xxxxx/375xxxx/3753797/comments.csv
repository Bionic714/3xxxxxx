,Jamaloy,2008-12-01T18:08Z,"Anybody having problems installing this in vista? When I go to the ""Sounds"" option under control panel, the srs audio sandbox is nowhere to be found. All seems to be working ok (patch etc.) I just cannot make SRS my default audio device, I installed this into XP and it worked a treat, any suggestions?"
,mostwanted_ray,2009-01-31T23:48Z,"workz 100%

,Zio_Sam,2009-02-05T21:37Z,"srs audio sandbox: fanstastic!! thanks!
keep on seeding!"
,super_pirate_88,2009-04-02T13:35Z,"ive been looking for this for months, finally found it.
one problem - it doesnt do 5.1 or quadraphonic which are the best configurations with most customizability, still amazin sound on headphones and stereo.
thank youuu very much"
,GarglingGlass,2009-05-24T22:59Z,"I've downloaded a couple copies of this and both have been a little buggy for me. They always pop up and minimize games when I start them, and when I open WMP. I think it might have to do with the cracks. Does anyone else have these problems?"
,tushae,2009-06-21T15:03Z,"well it worked perfectly but now my media player.. isn't
thanks anyway"
,maneff,2009-08-19T14:07Z,"This is unbefuckinlivable great soft! The best for now :> and I love it.

,atvowner17,2009-08-28T18:19Z,"Yeah im having the same problem. Invailed drive H

Any ideas, patches, or fixes?
Please help.
Thanks"
,atvowner17,2009-08-28T18:26Z,"Download PowerISO and mount about 4 or so drives so when you go into my computer there is a H: drive. Then try installing. Unmount all when finished.

PS dont mount anything to these drives, just set up that many to be used.

hope this help."
,atvowner17,2009-08-28T18:28Z,That didnt work fully. I got one step farther. Let me know if you figure it out. Sorry
,atvowner17,2009-08-29T06:26Z,"Hey this works, you need to download the SRS Audio Sandbox Windows 7 / Vista.

Use Power ISO and mount/set up three drives(how many it takes to make there be a drive H)

Run the exe install file.
Good Luck!"
,FlyJayCeezy,2009-09-14T19:03Z,"Works Great...

,carlnathan,2009-11-12T01:05Z,"it always pops up every time the song changes to the next track...    or sometimes starts itunes itself...

quite annoying. but thanks anyway"
,F3r4l,2009-11-28T05:52Z,"If you don't want it to pop up whenever you open a Game/WMPlayer.

Click on the Icon then go to Options->Preferences and un-check the ""Bring to front when popular media players are opened"" check box.

Also click on the ""Auto-Tech"" Bar in the Technology Section to disable it changing whenever you start a game."
,F3r4l,2009-11-28T06:00Z,"Oh and if you're having problems hearing sound effects in games.

Some games have Audio Settings that allow you to change it to Stereo/5.1 Channel. Change it to Stereo.

Other games don't have this option. Example ""Grand Theft Auto San Andreas""

So what you do is go to your Control Panel in Windows XP and open up the Sound and Audio Devices. Click on the Adanvanced Tab and change the speaker setup to Desktop Stereo or Quadraphonic or Headphones whichever suits you. I choose Desktop Stereo.

Now this is only a temporary solution. If you were to shut down the PC and turn it on again Windows Automatically changes it back to 5.1 Channel because of the SRS Audio Device.
"
,F3r4l,2009-11-28T06:10Z,"I also have a problem where some games i play, suddenly get very laggy and unplayable. Changing the Audio Setup to Stereo does solve this a bit.

But it didn't help when i did it for Call of Duty 4. Until i changed the Audio Sample in the settings of Call of Duty 4 to a lower rate. (22Khz)

Again San Andreas doesn't have this option. 

So what you do is go to your Control Panel in 
Windows XP and open up the Sound and Audio Devices. Click on the Advanced Tab and then to Performance. Slide the Sample Conversion Rate quality all the way Down to ""Good"" and this solves the issue.

Note: The Advanced Tab i refer to is located under the ""Speaker Settings"" section. Not the ""Device Volume"" one.

That's pretty much all the issues i came across when using this App. But its a great App nonetheless and i highly recommend it!

I'd also suggest purchasing this software. As it is awesome!"
,iwilleatu,2009-12-10T02:42Z,no win 7? that sux
,el_vj,2009-12-27T21:10Z,"wow i cant believe that i used to listen music WITHOUT this!!!:) 
How much time wasted... :(
Thx so much!"
,Chikk0,2010-06-18T02:06Z,Nice !!
,DraTkcuF,2010-08-02T01:45Z,so this doesn't work with Windows XP service Pack 3?
,FcOtelulGalati,2012-07-08T11:52Z,thanks.
