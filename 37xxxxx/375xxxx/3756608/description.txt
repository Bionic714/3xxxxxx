"It's an atomic acoustic missile!"

Jebediah Johns is an acoustic duo based out of a small town in Alabama. The group recently formed in January of 2007, but the Johns twins have been playing music together literally all of their lives. With it's diverse influences, Jebediah Johns blends lyrical passages with crunchy chords that create a sound the ear cannot ignore. They believe in giving each song its own identity not only through lyrics but through the timbre of the progression, the time of the transitions, tedious arranging, and at times improvisation. The two have years of experience not only from being in and out of several bands together playing the local bar circuits, but the two are also classically trained giving them a sense of know-how and at the same time a rockish edge.
