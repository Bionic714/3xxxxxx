,anindya,2007-07-29T13:10Z,If video is taken from the cintax release then its probably same as the nofear version. I guess the audio is better.
,Mff_killen_92,2007-07-29T13:13Z,Can i Open the files with Win Zip Pro ?
,SkurrePurre2,2007-07-29T13:16Z,"I don't know..

If you don't know, go to: www.rarlab.com and download WinRAR. The best program to unrar rar/zip files :)"
,puttish_,2007-07-29T14:10Z,Nån som har swesub till den här filmen eller?!?!?
,SkurrePurre2,2007-07-29T15:00Z,puttish_: man behöver ingen undertext till den här filmen eftersom att man bara garvar när man ser den.

,Halfmad,2007-07-30T10:48Z,"It works!
Finally, a good copy of the movie!
I just finished the download, and have only jumped through to a few random spots in the movie.  No heads in the way, and all looks good."
,sgtwilko,2007-07-30T21:15Z,"HURRAY:) This is the best copy ive seen yet !!!!very wachable , i am seeding like mad, cos its worth it , well done( SkurrePurre2)"
,sonof,2007-07-31T13:43Z,"Could someone please demux the audio from this and upload to rapidshare or like? I was stupid and downloaded the iND version and I can't hear the audio in it, only with VLC but then it crackles and sounds bad.

You can easily demux the audio using VirtualDubMod, open the video with VirtualDubMod, press Streams => Stream list => Demux and save as audio.mp3. Then please upload to somewhere and give me the link so I'll use this audio in the iND release instead.
I wouldn't ask for this but I have 256/256 internet connection now and it would take too many hours to download PUKKA instead now and we were planning on watching this film tonight :-/"
,sonof,2007-07-31T13:44Z,"Ignore my comment above, I wrote it to the wrong release, sorry.

It's weird I can't hear the audio of this with MPC or WMP. I have ffdshow codecs installed."

,sam44,2007-08-02T11:32Z,"I've just finished downloading the movie.
I'll start uploading it in a few hours.
I'll do it at least 1:1 but probably 2:1"
,Pottan85,2007-08-02T21:32Z,Skall se till att seeda 2:1 iaf.. riktigt bra tog mig 10min att tanka laddade i ~850k
,sam44,2007-08-03T06:14Z,"DON'T USE 7ZIP TO EXTRACT THE FILES.
