,SCLEMTAK,2009-06-15T03:25Z,Very good to find this movie.It is quite rare.I remember this being one of the most realistic UFO movies i had ever seen.
,sg71,2009-06-25T23:27Z,"Thanks azzllin. I have been looking for this for years without luck. As a kid I was amazed with this so I wanted to see it again for nostalgia.

Quality is bad considering it comes from a VHS source but since it is seemingly the *only* copy in existence I am very grateful.

VLC plays it fine though it does cough up an error about it being broken. Selecting ""Don't Repair"" allows it to play though. "
