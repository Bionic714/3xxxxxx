,RadicalMotE,2007-08-01T16:04Z,lol... an emulator + 514 games at the size of less than 2.5 mb? yea right.. probably virus or some really bad 17th century games...
,Keleberus,2007-08-03T13:28Z,"This is perfect. I missed a lot that simple yet funny kind of game. I'll seed it for a time... And RadicalMotE, you have no idea about how small a atari rom can be. It is a 8 bit processed system. With 64 kbytes of memory! Small in a way that my calculator is more powerfull! 

Great release!"
