Mobile Forces delivers explosive vehicle combat combined with traditional FPS action.

Built on top of Epic's latest Unreal Engine technology - graphics hardware is pushed to the limit by the use of static meshes to deliver complex believable environments, and poly counts go through the roof to give you smooth rolling terrain.

Mobile Forces offers the complete FPS offline/online multiplayer only experience with full AI bot support. The single focus of Mobile Forces is to create a gaming experience that any fan of the multiplayer-FPS genre will be at home playing.
