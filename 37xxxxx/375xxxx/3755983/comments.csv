,Vykos,2007-08-07T03:09Z,Thanks!
,Tao-avatar,2007-08-22T21:26Z,What program do I need to view these files?
,WoDAddict,2007-08-24T01:32Z,"Can we get some ReSEEDS...? I'm only at 6.4%...
...Adobe Reader/Acrobat for Viewing..."
,gesangbaer,2007-09-21T18:49Z,"Only 10% of these books actually work ... I appreciate whats there, but could this torrent be slimmed down a little by yanking out the dead wood?"
,lollebol,2007-10-07T15:38Z,pless seed
,13unlucky13,2007-10-18T00:02Z,"100% of these books function, you just need to ensure that you have the latest version of Adobe Reader to actually view them (currently v8.1.0). 

This is a fantastic torrent and I hope to see many more like it in the future from you, xenoterracide. Thank you and well done!"
,chaos890,2007-11-13T15:19Z,I was trying to download the file but was having problems with connecting. I tried 2 different torrent programs but am still having problems. Anyone have any advice?
,WoDAddict,2008-01-06T18:41Z,"Anyone have  ""Reliquary"" or ""Rome"" Yet?? They are the only ones I need ..."
,WoDAddict,2008-01-07T08:34Z,"My collection thus far, anyone have the ones I'm missing?

,xenoterracide,2008-01-18T01:39Z,"sorry I haven't released in forever. I still don't have a static connection. I get all my net from WAPs... I could try a new release but it would probably take a full month for anyone to get the whole thing.

otherwise I suggest here... 

http://cw.enlightning.de:6969/index.html?filter=World+Of+Darkness

It's where I get all my new stuff and some of the large ones should fix bugs in this release... 

If people want me to do another release let me know... I will probably wait a few weeks to get all my bugs sorted out."
,xenoterracide,2008-01-18T01:43Z,oh I have both rome and reliquary and I think everything that has been released since august 2007
,WoDAddict,2008-01-24T01:53Z,"Have everything but ""Fall of the Camarilla"""
,xenoterracide,2008-01-30T21:42Z,"attempting to up Changling the Lost series here
