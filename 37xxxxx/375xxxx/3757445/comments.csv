I THINK THIS COULD BE VERY USEFULL IF IT WORKS... GONNA TRY IT ON A PASSWORDED PC THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME................................... ."
,kmfdmk,2007-07-30T11:02Z,"You people are fucking idiots.  GO to the websites linked, google the stuff that's mentioned.  Download the utilities yourself and compare filesizes.  I can guarantee that there aren't any viruses in this, however you're a jackass if you download and run everything you find on the internet.  OF COURSE Scan it first I wouldn't expect you not to.  When you get the hacktool.passreminder look up what it means.

CHRIST... look here:  www.nirsoft.net

NirSoft web site provides a unique collection of small and useful freeware utilities, all of them developed by Nir Sofer.

Fully documented software by a renound programmer. (his stuff made it to slashdot.org)"

,cr00seffer,2008-02-07T22:52Z,"thanks for what looks like a great up. Good job kmfdmk, dont let the idiots bother you, although they sure do get on my nerves sumtimes too."
,nofile404,2008-12-14T21:44Z,"Thanks a bunch, kmfdmk. I've used these tools before and they are quite useful. If the fools who are badmouthing your post can't tell the difference between a true virus/trojan and ""potentially harmful program"", i.e; hacks & keygens, or don't know how to check the files they do see, well, that's their loss. Good work.
That's not to say I'm not going to scan the shit out of 'em anyway."
