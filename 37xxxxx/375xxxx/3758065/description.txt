Silver Bell was intended to be Patty Griffin's third album, but went unreleased by A&M Records, which scrapped its 2000 release after being bought by Interscope. Griffin has re-recorded songs from the album for later releases (such as "Making Pies" on 1000 Kisses, and "Mother of God," "Standing," and "Top of the World" on Impossible Dream), and others have been covered by the Dixie Chicks and The Wreckers. Copies of Silver Bell have leaked out, and can be acquired via the "B&P" (Blanks & Postage) method on message boards.

A&M dropped Patty's contract after Silver Bell, and she was picked up by Dave Matthews' ATO Records.
