,aramandai,2007-07-30T17:55Z,Thanks for sharing. Also appreciate that you haven't put the songs in a zip or rar format like so many others.
,camponotus,2007-08-01T16:10Z,"Yeah, I totally agree with you. I hate zipped torrents and can't understand why anyone would bother to zip multiple files into one. If it's not zipped, you can pick what you want from a torrent. "
