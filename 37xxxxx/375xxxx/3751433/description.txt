War Wind (1996)

Real-time strategy game set on a planet populated by four races, each with their own characteristics, and is premised on a rebellion and the ensuing conflict. Both conventional technology and magic play an important part in the game. The single-player game includes four campaigns, one for each group, consisting of seven missions. There is also a multi-player mode for up to eight via modem/serial link or LAN. The gameplay involves resource management, development of your forces and new technology, as well as combat.
