,resurrected666,2008-08-08T14:14Z,"Instructions to run on Windows XP
==========================

Copy the file ""dplay.dll"" from ""C:\windows\system32"" into your Game folder (where WW.EXE is located)

- The cinematics have a nasty horizontal black bar, turn OFF ""Full Screen Cinematics"" in the game options to get rid of it :)

- The game works well without any compatibility settings applied on my systems XP SP3

================================
YOU CANNOT SAVE OR LOAD A GAME ON VISTA.
The game crashes every time you click on ""open"" or ""save"". Normally (under XP), a windows open file dialog appears.

This is a known problem for other older software too (eg. Steinberg Wavelab 5.0 under Vista)

,ThirstOfBlood,2009-02-14T20:15Z,Anyone care to seed?
,ThirstOfBlood,2009-02-16T12:36Z,"If this is English version, then why are the intro and other videos in German? Everything else certainly is in English, so it's playable, but...?"
,Mist_or_Fog,2009-03-16T13:52Z,Just curious. But does anyone know where to get the iso for this game?
,DaReaperZ,2009-07-28T22:32Z,"Super bra spel, ett av de bästa RTS spelen genom tiderna. Mycket bättre än War Craft om ni frågar mig.

Great game, one of the best RTS games ever. A lot better than War Craft if you ask me."
