what do i need to do?"
,doubledge,2008-05-15T20:03Z,"PROBLEMS?
Try downloading CCCP (combined community codec pack - google it, it's free).
It comes with 2 really good media players that will play almost anything with the included codecs. In my opinion, it beats the pants off of vlc, which doesn't use codecs (they're built in filters on vlc) so you don't really have as much control of what you see.

SUBTITLES?
They're imbedded as a stream in  most mkv (matroska) rips, and you can turn 'em off (EXAMPLE: ZOOM PLAYER{included with cccp}
RIGHT CLICK WHILE PLAYING, CLICK ""STREAM SELECT"" AND ""HIDE SUBTITLES""

CONVERSION TO AVI?
NO PROBLEM! FIND VERSIONS OF WINAVI AND TOTAL VIDEO CONVERTER THRU TORRENT SITES (like this 1)

HOPE THIS HELPS OUT SOME OF YOU THAT HAVE POSTED PROBLEMS HERE.
GOOD LUCK, AND HAPPY RIPPING!"
