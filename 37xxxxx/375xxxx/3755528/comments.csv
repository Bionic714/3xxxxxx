,eb#1,2007-07-28T11:58Z,"Great! This will make it harder for people to drop one disc once they have finished it (like most people did with season 1 :-/ ) :-) 

I have dropped everything else now and will give all the upload I have to this one."
,eb#1,2007-07-28T12:01Z,But I should add that I will block people who don't upload.
,away1,2007-07-28T14:16Z,"nice, way to go wormman ;-)"
,away1,2007-07-28T15:38Z,"I'm getting an error => ""to many peers""

Is there a problem with the tracker or is there something else wrong?"
,eb#1,2007-07-28T16:33Z,I'm getting the same error....
,away1,2007-07-28T21:19Z,The problem is solved I see :-)
[T],kef71,2007-07-29T08:26Z,Excellent! I'll seed with all I got when I've finished downloading the first season in about 24h. :o)
[T],wormman,2007-07-29T18:00Z,"
I just want to know if everything is okey ."
,eb#1,2007-07-29T21:57Z,It's coming down just fine now :-)
,away1,2007-07-29T22:17Z,everything's fine ;-)
,raggaman-pirat,2007-07-31T01:22Z,"I'm getting an error too => ""to many peers"""
[T],wormman,2007-08-05T00:03Z,Many of you are good seeders I can see.   But let us help the rest until I upload season 3 in approx.. 1 week.
,away1,2007-08-05T12:26Z,No problem wormman ;-)
,away1,2007-08-06T20:26Z,Complete 8 times but only 4 seeders (incl. myself) 50% of the seeders have walked away :-(
,eb#1,2007-08-07T00:21Z,"Yes, it's depressing. I will continue to seed until I have a 20x ratio as usual. I'm at 13x now so it will be at least another day or two."
[T],wormman,2007-08-07T01:11Z,"To you people that only download and run, it's better to give a little seeding help than nothing.
Thank's to you guys or girls that stay and help."
,away1,2007-08-07T15:27Z,"this isn't funny anymore, if I counted correctly there should be 11 people who have completed this upload now and there are still only 4 seeders. Taking into account that the ""die hard"" seeders have uploaded far more then the original 53.29 GiB (especialy eb#1) it starts to look like hit & run paradise over here."
[T],wormman,2007-08-07T20:35Z,"Don't worry I will keep all 22 TOS discs on my hdd for some time, and I will check if the seeding  has stoped and reseed if necessary.But keep up the good seeding work that some of you do."
,away1,2007-08-08T01:01Z,"I don't worry, I will keep on seeding this season untill you lounch the third season :-)

I just wanted to express my feelings ;-)"
,eb#1,2007-08-11T06:09Z,"Ok, I have done my 20x ratio so now I will leave this. Still not many seeders but it says 10,9 in availability so the people downloading should be fine as long as they share what they have amongst themselves even if all seeders drop out.

Thanks for this one wormman. Looking forward to season 3 :-)"
[T],wormman,2007-10-17T16:30Z,I am seeding on http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3843621#filelistContainer right now but I will reseed this one next week.
,elakarune,2007-10-20T22:14Z,"can someone seed.

,Sramp,2012-01-04T09:36Z,"Thanks for the great upload wormman. When I'm done download it, I will seed it for at least 2 months. I'm at 95,6% now and my share ratio is 1,7 :o)"
,Sramp,2012-01-14T05:42Z,Hi again... Now I'm done with the download and as I promised: I will seed it for 2 more months. I have already seeded 95.75 GB...
