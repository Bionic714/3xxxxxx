,nikkiroxx,2007-10-10T08:37Z,"I'm not easy to scare, I've seen tons of documentaries like ghost hunters, and read so many things. Experienced some psycho things myself. And for the faint hearted, this could easily kill you man! Haha! It started off pretty dull, but the last part... it's damn crazy dude!
It gave me shivers for days!

Thanks for sharing everyone!"

,claytona57,2010-02-05T03:47Z,I've been searching for this since it was televised on Sci-Fi Thanks.  Also please seed & raise the upload & download limits.  Taking almost 2 days to download and only @ 50%
,ToneZone,2010-02-07T14:29Z,"I'm sckeptical about the flying brick.  If you notice, Nick says, ""This is the room.""  Zakk says, ""What room?""  Then they walk in and Nicks IR light stays on the flying brick.

Just plants the seed of doubt in my mind.  The build up is fantastic though.
Thanks for the upload.  I've downloaded this show in it's entirety from a different torrent so if anyone reads this.  This is their first TV special they shot in 2004.  "
