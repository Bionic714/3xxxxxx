,Bukaneer,2010-03-18T10:17Z,"This copy has very poor sound quality. Very loud back noise. If you made digital copy of Vinyl without use of very expensive external DAC, the result is poor quality CD sound with crackle. Its useless to encode it in 96kHz 24-bit format. Best results has riping CD's in Exat Audio Copy to 44,1kHz 16-bit loosless format."
