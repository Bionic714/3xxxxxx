Man! Mef made a major come back on this album. This album displays a very hungry, lyrically ferocius MEF. Also it has some very good hooks, some beats with ridiculous bass to bang out of the woofers in your car, and some decent guests appearances. The best guest Tical has on this album is the late ol'dirty. That song is probably one of my favorites on the whole album due to the dope verses laid down by both method man and ol' dirty. All in all this album is one of the best efforts I have heard from Method man in a long time. This album gets a big thumbs up from me!!!!!!!!
