,telesien,2007-08-28T16:32Z,"first you MUST install the original HOI2 doomsday (maybe with at least 1.02 patch), othewise you'll get this massage"
,Murska,2007-10-15T12:31Z,"The file's small because this is a strategy game which doesn't feature huge amounts of detailed, space-costly graphics."
,bertie4evr,2008-01-19T01:46Z,How do I install.Cannot with Daemontools
,jacksparr0w,2008-10-13T09:22Z,"This is just an expansion pack. First install HoI 2. Here is a torrent to HoI 2 DD

This expansion adds few scenarios, extends time line and fixes a few bugs."

You don't need Daemon for this just run the setup.exe, install, then play!"
