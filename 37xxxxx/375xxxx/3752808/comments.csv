btw what is the name of the song at 32:00 when they are dancing? would gladly like to know it! :D"
,Nelerion,2007-07-27T13:02Z,"It sounds like Fatboyrythms and I hear the word ""Cornershop"" so here's my wild guess; 

Some club/dub-remix of Fatboy slim's remix of Cornershop's song Brimful of Asha. 

Look through all new club cd's for some answers."
