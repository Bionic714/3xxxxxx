,supernashwan77,2009-06-06T10:49Z,"I can comfirm this movie is this movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103905/

However, the person who ripped this did so at the wrong aspect ratio: 4:3, when it should be 1:1.66 or 16:9.  The english subtitles are burned into the movie and the quality isnt very good.

I'm now looking for another version of this great film :-("
,piejohnson121,2009-08-21T11:45Z,the quality is iffy if u use windows media but if u play it using divx its beautiful
,KentAntonPhilip,2010-02-04T07:05Z,"spoken language: english?
it's french"
,KentAntonPhilip,2010-02-04T07:07Z,and can a movie about a serial killer be so boring??
,nemozeen,2010-03-29T11:31Z,This is the only version with subs around and people still complain.
,tintinuk,2010-08-29T12:45Z,Great addition to my collection of international horror classics - thanks!
,FRivera,2010-09-14T16:41Z,"it's weird how it got 7.5 and almost all the comments are negative, I'll still watch it!"
[V],manOtor,2010-10-17T17:01Z,"This movie is fantastic! I watched it as a teenager on VHS. I've been searching for this for a loooong time...

Spoken language: FRENCH!
Subtitles: English

For all the people above who seem to have no cineastic background knowledge at all:
This movie is ment to be in exactly the quality it is presented here - the rip is great, the crappy documentary-like quality of the picture was done by purpose.
I was never again so amused and disturbed at the same time. Hilarious and scary! Wonderful!"
,nilbud,2011-01-12T17:43Z,"This movie is a true classic. If you don't ""get it"" then you should throw yourself off a bridge because you're part of the problem not part of the solution."
,Sumalia,2011-05-22T23:03Z,This is the edited version(92 minutes).The uncut version is three minutes longer.
,indiaman,2011-12-19T08:52Z,Thanks.Great but disturbing movie.
