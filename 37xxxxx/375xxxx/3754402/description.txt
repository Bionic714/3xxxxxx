IT IS POSSIBLE THAT YOUR AV MAY DETECT A HACK TOOL, THIS IS NORMAL. DO YOU THINK AV'S LIKE HACK TOOLS ?!

LONGCAT FLOODER SERVER
======================
Welcome. This is a program made by Anon, for Anon.

First off: If you can't run this you will need the .NET Framework 2.0,
you can get this at www.microsoft.com

When running this server you can accept Longcat Flooder clients. (v3.0 and up). 
What you can do with this server is set a target:port and a protocol: SYN, UDP, HTTP.
Then hit 'Save'. Now every client that connects to your server will receive those settings. 

Now you're ready to start your flood, click the "Start" button. While you're running
the flood, every client that connects will also start flooding automatically.

This way you can ask friends to join in on the flood.

Tests by the Anonymous Testing Laboratories have shown that for webservers UDP and HTTP (UDP|HTTP)
flooding works best. In other cases it's been shown that a combination of SYN and UDP (SYN|UDP)
works best to take down a connection.

Go forth, go looooooooooong!

LONGCAT FLOODER CLIENT (beta)
======================
Same as above, except on the receiving end. 
If you wish to run the flooder without receiving server settings you can just hit Disconnect.


SETTINGS EXPLAINED:
=====================
IP/Host: 
DNS host or IP address of your target

Port: 
Port you will be aiming at (80 for webservers, 3306 for MySQL, 21 for FTP and 23 for Telnet)

Method of attack: 
Select the type of flooding you will be using. If you wish to use more than one
just select the one that suits your needs. e.g. UDP + HTTP = "UDP|HTTP". SYN is a TCP based attack.

Serverlist:
Addresses (dns host or IP) of Longcat Flooder Servers where you can get certain settings from.
That way you can always setup your own flooding operation yourself. To define more than one server
(redundancy ftw!) you can add another address or IP and seperate them with a pipe |
e.g. server1|server2|server3| .... etc.


FUTURE RELEASES:
================
I'll try to release newer and more stable versions in the very near future (think weeks not months)
you'll find them at the regular places.
