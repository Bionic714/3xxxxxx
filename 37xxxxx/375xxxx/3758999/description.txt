One of Bergman's warmest, and therefore finest films, this concerns an elderly academic?grouchy, introverted, dried up emotionally?who makes a journey to collect a university award, and en route relives his past by means of dreams, imagination, and encounters with others. It's an occasionally over-symbolic work (most notably in the opening nightmare sequence), but it's filled with richly observed characters and a real feeling for the joys of nature and youth. And Sjöström?himself a celebrated director, best known for his silent work (which included the Hollywood masterpiece The Wind)?gives an astonishingly moving performance as the aged professor. As Bergman himself wrote of his performance in the closing moments: 'His face shone with secretive light, as if reflected from another reality...It was like a miracle.' (Geoff Andrew, Time Out)
