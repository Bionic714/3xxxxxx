,DocEvil,2008-02-12T12:53Z,"Why do people suck at comments?!

This is a great upload. It works pretty well, DEPENDING ON YOUR OS!
It is a Windows 98/95 game. IT WILL NOT FUNCTION ON VISTA!
But...weren't there cinematics in this game? I can't remember fully, as I havn't played it since 2000, but I thought there were a bunch of little live-action cinematics.
Back to the OS issue.....if you're having problems with installing the game on vista, here is what you do;
1. Get a copy of XP
2. If you have a disc of vista, burn it, break it, scratch it, use it for shooting practice, vent it into space, just do ANYTHING other than put that crap into your computer.
3. Wipe your HD partitions because Vista will just wipe XP away every time you install it.
4. Reinstall XP and enjoy being able to use your software and a good portion of the hardware out there on the market!"
,Trooperr,2008-02-15T13:55Z,"For the person that think they no it all .... e.g DocEvil ....

you CAN run in on vista ....

Right click the exe .... click compatability tab ... Run as compatability with windows 2000 

magic it works .. even on vista"

,Teufelshunde,2009-01-25T05:03Z,"HEY lb236969,

The exe for the game (on my Vista machine) is C:\Westwood\SUN\SUN.exe
That is the default install for it.
Do just like Trooper said and right click on SUN.exe and then select the ""Compatibility"" tab. I changed mine to ""Run this program in combatibility mode for: Windows 98/Me""
Mine has been working fine just like that. I have the other settings unchecked.
Good luck!"

,Kretsmoke,2009-04-29T19:02Z,"am i missing something here? is it not simply a case of rippin it from the CD, creating an ISO and then making a torrent out of it? inform me if im wrong but jesus, everybody thinks they know how to make it better. truth is you cant. stop modding, hi-resing and generally ruining classic games!!!!!!

p.s. i have the same problems with just about every 3D realms game ive downloaded. if anyone has any of them (duke nukem atomic, shadow warrior etc) please put them up :D thanks much."

AIM me if you think you can help, its ""pidgeb"""
,EKJ-09,2009-06-29T16:02Z,"Right people heres the retards step by step instructions on how to get this to work to full capacity:

1) Download the torrent (duuuuurrrrr)
2) Extract the torrent using win rar or what ever. you will find in the rar file two other rar files one for tiberian sun the other for firestorm extract them both till you havw the raw files.
3) Then open the firestorm folder (ignore the tiberian sun file) find the ""setup.exe"" file and execute it.

4) IF YOU ARE RUNNING VISTA OR THE FILE JUST WONT WORK AND COMES UP WITH A MESSAGE SAYING ""CANT FIND SOME .DLL"" OR WHATEVER RIGHT CLICK ON THE FILE GO PROPERTIES AND CLICK THE COMPATIBILITY TAB AND CHECK THE ""RUN IN COMPATIBILITY MODE AND SET THE DROP BOX TO ""WINDOWS 98 /  WINDOWS ME""

5) ok now the file should execute into the setup. follow the set up through when it asks you for a product key just click next then it will ask you what part you want to install un-check ""install and run music files from hard drive"" (if you keep this checked it dosent seam to work) and check ""install tiberian sun"".

6) now it should give you the option to chose where to install the file the default location should be C:\westwood\SUN. change it if you want but remember where it is.

7) Now install it. all this installation does is create a new registry file that allows the program to run on the computer without a disc.

8) ok now all you need to do is select all the files and folders inside the firestorm folder and copy them into the directory that the installation file created. when it asks you if you want to copy wordata.key over the one already in the folder say no.

9) then once its copied duble click on ""Game.exe"" and the game should run without a hitch offering you the ability to play firestorm and just normal Tiberian sun. 

10) now you can add short cuts or whatever to you desktop to the ""game.exe"" file. also note that the installation process created a Westwood folder in your start menu with a tiberian sun folder in it but its empty so you can also create a short cut there if you like.

oh and if you want to play a completely un-changed version of tibirian sun thats what the other folder you extracted is for, that should work just by clicking on the ""game.exe"" and if not change the compatibility again.

anyway thats about it. Im hoping that will help people who are stuck. really a guide should be in a txt file in the torrent but its not. "
,clotters1,2009-06-30T14:17Z,"I've got tiberian sun with no cd patch, but i didn't hav firestorm, if i copy the firestorm directory to the folder where tibrian sun is, will it work???

Copy that into your /SUN/ folder or wherever
