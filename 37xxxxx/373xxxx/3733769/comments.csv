,limpistol,2007-07-09T17:47Z,"This torrent is a Matroska container (MKV file) with H.264 codec
video and DTS multichannel audio.
That's good for watching on a computer, but usually not so
compatible to e.g. stand-alone media players. 
Here are the commands I used to convert this to a more compatible
AVI container with XviD codec video and MP3 audio. Maybe it will
be useful to somebody. Using two free open source tools available
to both Windows, Linux and other.
I did this as two steps, first step mainly to change container,
and audio channels, and second step to go to XviD and reduce the
file size and frame size.
The frame size change (-vf scale -zoom -xy 640) is not necessary, and
the final video bit rate (1000) could maybe better be increased to
preserve quality, but the result by below commands is not bad at all.
This is just one way to do it. Probably the two steps can be combined
by a different combination of all the many available options.

ffmpeg -i Gedo.Senki.mkv -sameq -ac 2 -ab 160000 Gedo.Senki.ffmpeg.avi
Around two hours.
Video: FMPG4 ~1500 Kbit/s VBR, 24.390 fps, 672x432
Audio: 160 Kbit/s CBR, 48KHz, MP2

mencoder Gedo.Senki.ffmpeg.avi -noodml -oac mp3lame -ovc xvid 
 -vf scale -zoom -xy 640 -xvidencopts bitrate=1000 -o Gedo.Senki.mencoder.avi
Around six hours.
Video: XviD 1000 Kbit/s CBR, no GMC/Qpel, 24.390 fps, 640x346
Audio: 128 Kbit/s CBR, 48KHz, MP3

,eyekeeper,2007-08-18T18:32Z,I am having a lot of difficulty to view this video. thank you for the advice limpistol. I only wish this was not such a long process. 
,simmek,2008-01-08T16:19Z,Can't understand why one would want to have it in avi rather then mkv. To view mkv-files use the 'combined community codec pack' http://www.cccp-project.net/ It will install all codecs you need and 'Media Player Classic'. The settings can be hard for newbs to undestand but it's configured for standard usage so no need to change them unless you know what you want.
,Gn2me,2008-01-25T03:44Z,its a whole hell of a lot easier to burn
,Misterrandom,2008-01-27T10:06Z,"To Simmek:

You know of many stand alone DVD players that will play MKV files?  My DVD player and PS3 both play XviD and DivX.  Thats why, in the absence of a full DVD5 or DVD9 rip AVI is preferred for a lot of people, myself included, who don't have a PC hooked up to their AV set up."
,SmileyWitchFaerie,2008-02-04T02:20Z,"For those of you having issues viewing or getting a player to view it ... I suggest getting the matroska codec pack and use real alternative player as a view both together have never failed me in any format d/led , I also have installed the allin1 codec pack , which you can find any of these just by searching the net with the names I posted here . Hope this helps anyone . "
