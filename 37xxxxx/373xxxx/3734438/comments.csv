,Petemeister,2007-07-06T19:59Z,What an interesting upload. Unusual enough to warrant a download (probably helps I'm in the RAF!)
,Petemeister,2007-07-06T20:03Z,"...although I'm not seeing a seeder :(..........

,wankan,2007-07-07T12:09Z,The tracker list in this torrent needs a CR at the end of eack tracker to enable it (in Utorrent anyways) . Though it's saying that this is an unregistered torrent at http://vip.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce and http://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce
,brevoort,2007-07-09T01:27Z,This is a terrific find.  A real aviation history treasure.  After 24 hours from the original seeder it suddenly jumped to 27 within 5 minutes.
,wankan,2007-07-09T01:38Z,"Hi , ballintomb .
Thanks for the films . Very interesting as I like old history/propaganda films .
As an aside (can't PM you) , and not a criticism per se , I do think that up to 4857 kbps (on part3 for example) is a little high a resolution for old monochrome footage . You could have probably gotten away with a lot less and saved bandwidth . 
Thanks again ."

,bikeclips63,2007-12-30T18:27Z,"Talk about waiting lol. Taken me weeks to get this one. Hope it's worth the wait. 
Thanks ballintomb."
,theupsetter,2008-01-28T19:09Z,Thanks I love all these old RAF films
,lektran,2009-02-16T03:10Z,"The Qeen is garded by UFO-fleet during
her Coronation.
RAF gathered about 600 airplanes, to expose to the Qeen.
The RAF air-parade was very suspisios and confusing to the UFO:s.
The circeled the incoming plane, like bees. 
They check out the Bombers if they had bombs.
Have one UFO sitting on top of the cockpit.

To understand this ET activety, YOU must understand , that 1 sec for us, is like 2 minutes for them,or more.
And to understand futher, se ""NASA , the smoking gun"""
,lektran,2009-02-16T03:13Z,"Download  and use the ""STEP2 or ""PAUSE-button.
Play at low speed on playback."
,lektran,2009-02-23T14:52Z,"Time 04:21 , into the Royal Coronation .
UFO 2 meter outside the cockpit window, at 600 km/h !
Reason ? To check they where english ?
Or to scare the shit out of the pilots.
The ""Victor"" , was made to carry NUKES !"
