,pags2,2007-07-02T23:00Z,Thanks for this. I didn't even know there was a new version. Now if you can get Creative off their asses to write a proper driver I would be very happy.
,Dog909,2007-07-02T23:45Z,"Cheers for this.
Shame it's not as simple as writing a driver though :("
,angma,2007-08-03T12:50Z,THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU! I can't believe the f**kers at Creative are charging for drivers and EAX support. Our cards came with cds that had EAX support in the drivers and hardware--that was part of what we purchased. F**K Creative. I will seed this for a VERY long time and I hope I see newer versions cracked and released.
