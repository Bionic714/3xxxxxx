Description: Christian fundamentalism, millenarianism, exploitation horror and demented agitprop fantasy create the most curious and entertaining mix in this visualization of the sermon of real-life preacher Estus Pirkle. A Soviet invasion (that according to Pirkle will happen in 24 months unless people embrace Christianity) features shabby-looking soviet soldiers piercing children's eardrums with sticks so they cannot hear the word of God, teaching them "Communism is Good! Christianity is Stupidity!" and decapitating the ones that refuse to give in. In a parallel story the local slut comes in late to join the bored-looking crowd of Pirkle's sermon to find herself in the end begging Pirkle for forgiveness amid flashbacks of her poor dead mother entreating her to turn to Jesus. All the while Pirkle teaches us that drive-in theaters are "spawning houses for sex," Saturday morning TV cartoons "teach our children crime, sex and murder," and "Dancing is just as wrong as it's always been. It's the front door to sex, and the thing that's started on the dance floor is expected to end in a car or a motel room."
