   Join the Brotherhood of Steel, a technological revival group dedicated
   to restoring the world    to its former prosperity through science and
   whatever means necessary. Take part in a quest to reawaken long-dormant
   technology in order to defeat a powerful enemy in the one of a kind
   Fallout Universe. Each mission involves various hostile obstacles that
   must be overcome using tactical skirmish warfare. The player controls
   up to six detailed characters in the single player mission-based campaign
   or they may use their chosen squad online in multiplayer battles.
   Squad-members improve with experience, increasing their skills and earning
   perks. Many varieties of weapons, from handguns to rocket launchers,
   allow the player to lay waste to his enemies. In addition, the fighting
   isn't limited to pedestrians, as squad-members may take the action to
   the streets with armed vehicles.
