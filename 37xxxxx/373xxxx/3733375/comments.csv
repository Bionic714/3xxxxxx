 Greetings fellow pirates.

 There is indeed a new enemy amongst torrents and they are trying to control
 all good gaming torrents everywhere. Leeching and dumping data, not sharing
 a bit of data, which is making it near impossible to download many torrents.

 I have included a dopeman_blocklist.txt file. YOU MUST load this file to
 Peerguardian as an addtional blocklist -or- load the file to whatever means
 of IP blocking you have available to your BT Client.

 If you do not, you will simply be sharing data to these cowards and not other
 legit torrent users trying to download. 

 Please try to understand the importance of this. It must be used to begin
 saving game torrents everywhere. This is a new enemy. We must do our best 
 to fight back to preserve our freedom of sharing. 

 Please use the blocklist and share it anyway you can.

 dopeman"

,muchomacho333,2008-01-17T19:44Z,"To all of you who couldn't get the game to run!!

I did two things... 1. moved the folder SSII to my ""C:\program"" folder (or ""C:\program files"" if you're not using a swedish OS). Then I dissabled my anitvirus software, and everything works fine now.

Come on! It doesn't take a computer pro to search google for five minutes ;P"

Just like GTA:SA that I got from ToeD if I play Singleplayer within the first few minutes of starting singleplayer story my computer will freeze up and go to a BLUE SCREEN. Its not the blue screen of death there is no text what soever its just a Blank blue screen and the sound that was currently playing gets stuck and just plays like a broken record. How do I fix this? I really love serious sam seeing as I have close encounters on my PS2 and id really love to have this problem fixed so I can play SSII Thank you.
