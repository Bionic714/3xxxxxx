"12 year olds Romeo and Gavin live next door to each other. They're the best of mates with a shared sense of humour that helps them survive in a landscape of comic losers and broken dreams. But their friendship is put to the test by a chancer encounter.

After a stranger saves them from being beaten up, the boys are only too happy to help their new hero and pal in his quest to date Romeo's sister. Little do they realise they are being drawn into a world of dangerous obsession, violence and desperation; a world that threatens to tear the two friends apart.

From acclaimed director Shane Meadows 'A Room for Romeo Brass' is a contemporary coming-of-age story that is as funny as it is frightening."

A must see film basically. Oh and it was Paddy Considine's (one of the Andy's: Hot Fuzz) first acting role, and what a performance it is.
