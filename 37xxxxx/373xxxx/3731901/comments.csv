,Friendly_hazard,2007-07-24T07:14Z,ummmm wtf is a flac file?
,farcaller,2007-07-28T20:29Z,"if you don't know - you don't really want this torrent ;)

PS: FLAC is one of the best lossless codecs around."
,rebeudyr,2007-07-29T05:11Z,"http://flac.sourceforge.net/

FLAC is the lossless codec I use on every single rip, for archiving.  It works similarly to winzip, in that what comes out of the compressed file is exactly the same as what went in.  FLAC's compression algorithm is, tadah, optimized for audio compression.

By the way, if you download this torrent, you're breaking various copyright laws, unless you own the media contained. (i think... :P)"
,madpresley,2007-09-15T10:56Z,"""VALLEY OF THE DAMNED"" is everything but FLAC[:mad] The quality is f***in shit.I have it on mp3-192 and it sounds far, far better."
,adioslayer12,2008-02-06T03:27Z,ok so its compressed so how do you get the music on itunes
,manhunter098,2008-02-07T06:08Z,"Its in flac, so you will have to convert the tracks to a file type that is supported by i Tunes.

Also the tracker for this doesnt seem to be working, all of the ones for *http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org:80/announce* seem to be down, so I think if everyone who downloads this adds this URL to the tracker list, it might help distribute the file better.

,manhunter098,2008-02-07T06:10Z,"Oops. I listed wrong not working tracker, but that one doesnt seem to work either, in fact it would seem that right now all the http://tpb. trackers are not working."
