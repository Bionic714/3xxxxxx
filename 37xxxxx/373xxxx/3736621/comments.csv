,j_runbert,2007-07-09T15:45Z,this ain't HDTV!
,BBu,2007-07-16T01:28Z,"HDTV means the source was HDTV but it was scaled down. Look for HR HDTV which stands for High Resolution HDTV which is ""real"" HDTV.

If you download stuff, you should learn the terminology, you moron."
,mogwai3,2007-07-23T15:47Z,"Actually, HR.HDTV isn't ""real"" HDTV either. ""Real"" HDTV is 1024x720 for 720p or 1920x1080 for 1080i. HR.HDTV is scaled down to 960x528 which is better than the normal HDTV-releases (624x352).

If you want ""real"" HDTV you could look for stuff labled with 720p.HDTV.x264 or similiar which is indeed 720p but compressed using the x264 codec.
There is also uncompressed HD-content most commonly in MPEG2-format, both 720p and 1080i."
,neopulsar,2007-11-10T13:36Z,NO.. HDTV is either 1280*720(720p) or 1920*1080(1080i)
