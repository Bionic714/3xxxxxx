,chabosun4,2012-02-28T20:13Z,"Excellent rip, but I should add that this is the initial blue-label ""Jazz Masterpieces"" digital remaster, which has a very different sound than all the other editions I've heard. It sounds much more ""reverby"" and crystalline than, for example, the Legacy remaster, and Chambers' bass sounds... odd."
