,Xbizkit,2008-02-12T21:40Z,DONT DOWNLOAD THIS FUCKIN STUPID SHIT ITS ALL FUCKED UP FUCK YOU FUCKING PIECE A SHIT
,equazcion,2008-02-19T03:06Z,"Excellent, works, almost completely self-contained. I was worried while downloading this, about the complication of multiple packages, patches, cracks, serials. But it's actually not that complicated. It does, however, take a bit longer than the average game install.

Here are the steps for those confused:

1. Download
2. Mount or burn. If mounting, mount the MDS file. I used PowerISO.
3. Run setup file. Choose ""Complete"".
4. When asked, enter BF2 serial: EKWW - ZBE9 - EEEE - VFUC - KYOU
5. When asked, enter Special Forces serial: FTRZ - DW5C - NNDM - U3MV - SQEF

Note that setup will install everything: BF2, EU/Armored Fury, and Special Forces. It will also install patches, including the 1.41 patch TWICE, once after BF2 and once after EU/AF, which is required. This is all automatic so just keep clicking next and waiting. It may take a while.

6. When everything is done, you need to apply a crack, which is the only thing not included. Go to http://m0007.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_battlefield_2.shtml#Battlefield%202:%20Euro%20Force%20/%20Amored%20Fury%20v1.41%20SP%20[ENGLISH]%20No-DVD/Fixed%20EXE and get the Euro Force/Armored Fury NoDVD crack. This included two versions of the crack, one for NoDVD and one for use with DVD or mounted image. Use the one that applies to you. 

7. Play :)

Hope that was helpful. "

It's length but it gets the job done. Questions? Comment "
,BF2SF,2009-01-15T02:36Z,"BTW!

****NO YOU CANNOT PLAY ONLINE****

Q. but whyyyyyyyyyyyy
A. Because the serials aren't real. Yes you can install the game, but you can't register and play online. Did you get to play 10 mins before getting kicked? Yes. If you really want muliplayer you have to buy it."
,BF2SF,2009-01-15T02:37Z," @jiixo at 2008-12-27 18:52 CET:
does this game run under vista?

can someone answer to this?

***Yes, go to properties-compatability and set it to windows xp.

Then run the game as administrator"
,pruttrick,2009-01-25T12:31Z,"The patch included is v.1.4 not 1.41. 
You need the 1.4. carck or the 1.41. patch if you want this to work. Both crack can be found on gamecopyworld.com
This dosen't work on Vista HP 32bit but it works on XP 32bit. On Vista, the mouse freezes after the map has loaded. On XP everything works fine.

Tip: Because this is only for single-player, you can only play singleplayer maps with max 16 bots (8vs.8). 
If you go to this link, and download the ""40 vs 40 mod"", or ""32 Man Lan"", you can play larger maps with more bots!!!:
