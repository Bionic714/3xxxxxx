King Megalomania's Fonts Dvd 1.5 (June 2007)

More fonts than you can use in your lifetime. And no they are not in seperate zipfiles. no they are not in separate folders. There are one folder with +35 000 fonts. Use font software to browse thru them. If you like it another way go ahead and make your own font DVD.
