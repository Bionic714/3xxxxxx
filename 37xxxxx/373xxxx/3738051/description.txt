Dixie Dregs: Live in New York 1981
----------------------------------

CD Rip MP3 192Kbs. CD image included.


Recorded at My Father's Place in Roslyn (Long Island), New York. This CD was apparently created from when the show was broadcast on WLIR radio live at the time. Finally there's a good CD of it to replace my worn out, mangled cassette.

The sound quality is great and the performance ROCKS, capturing the Dregs at their height on the Unsung Heroes tour.
