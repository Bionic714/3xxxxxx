,RubberTow,2007-08-19T07:28Z,"hey, Maid in Jax, I (RUBrTOE) reside south of you in fl. Sorry, nocando on the Aliens thing because they all sucked.  Species 3 sucks too, I downloaded  it doesn't have Natasha in it. the only reason for having 2 is if Natasha is nekkid. I couldn't sit and watch 10 minutes of Aliens- a bunch of nitwits running away from a monster for 2 damn hours and Weaver is Yougly as hell. Natasha not so. Species had potential to be a great movie and a naked Natasha but the director and writers blew it every chance they got until it was only slightly better than Aliens. I kept thinking at certain points ""wow, if she.."" or he and she!"" ...would be great, but it never happened the way it should have. Anyway, I'm trying to download Natasha 2, but may have to rip it to get a copy. Either way, I'll keep it to seed it better. As far as doing the Alien thing,  a movie I rip must have these qualities: suspense, excellent directing, terrific writing and acting, great character development or, lacking those things, copious amounts of female nudity with a semblance of a plot and costumery like Daisy Dukes and cutoff halter tops at the bottom of the breasts without bras, or Marilyn Monroe or Raquel Welch or some nude 60s sex kitten such as Joey Heatherton. Aliens has none of the above, so for me to rip that garbage, I need a little tit-4-tat. What are you offering?"
,RubberTow,2007-08-19T08:54Z,"Why Xvid? it's inferior to Divx avi's and the same players play both. .divx is nothing bjust .avi. In fact, ou can change the file name to .avi and it will play like any other .avi file. I do all my rips with the Divx converter and change the .divx to .avi. itf you can play my Species rip, why request Xvid? Short answer: I don't do Xvid, only Divx because it is easier to use and makes a smaller, cleaner file. one of my email addresses is RAWise2@netzero.com if you want to comiserate more directly."
,CraziBroad,2007-11-05T19:19Z,"you got the titles confused, you have species 1 labeled as 2 and vise versa lol 2 is really the first one. and the first one is really the 2nd one. cause when they bring it back to earth is the 1st and when she escapes is the 2nd one..and the 3rd one..i didn't like..to animated..o well..its a sequel i suppose."
