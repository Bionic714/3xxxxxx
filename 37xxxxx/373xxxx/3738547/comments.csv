,mrmagoo25,2007-08-22T21:05Z,"Of the 400 plus who downloaded please seed and not just leach, we have been stuck for days at 35.7%"
,Ryhelios,2007-08-25T08:07Z,DUDE THE TORRENT IS DEAD.  YOU WILL NOT BE MAKING ANY PANTIES DROP BY READING THEM
,prezet,2007-08-27T20:22Z,"WTF ???
The 'downloads count' have passed 500 (was 400 something), and I have had the torrent up and running 24/7 and haven't received a single bit. ?
And still no seed?..."
,troy-vernon,2007-08-30T19:15Z,"I was able to locate some of the files that are missing from this torrent through a little creative web browsing. 

I've added them in but still only gets me to around 55% - perhaps if some of the other 200+ folks out there trying to download this could do the same we will all end up with a completed download.  

Even better would be if someone could re-seed.

,DCoBodom,2007-10-10T18:44Z,"My download is totally stuck, can someone seed plz? :("
,TheBlackFeather,2008-03-22T03:47Z,"This is a fantastic torrent. Maybe a little more mentalism than I would like, but that's only a personal opinion. Plenty of everything else here too."
,busybee909,2008-04-08T08:33Z,"What can I say?  This is the single greatest file I have ever downloaded from the internet.  I have long been a casual practicioner of magic but the high cost and rarity of so many of these books stopped me from really getting my teeth into it.  With this file, I have a lifetime of reading and studying ahead of me.  THANK YOU Obscure for compiling this.  Do you know if there is an online community for swapping these kinds of files?  I have quite a few books that are not included in this file that I would be happy to scan and trade with others, and I would love to collect as many scans of magic books as I can, even further adding to this massive collection."
,lumberjohn,2008-06-20T15:07Z,I would love to share some of the files I've collected.  Just email me at lumberjohn@hotmail.com.

,Betasilverback,2010-05-24T22:40Z,"WTF!!!  

Peek Performances has the MOST IMPORTANT pages missing.  Pages 28 and 29 are missing.  If anyone has the book please scan them and send them to daisycrazy888@yahoo.com.  I will send you Strong Magic, or any other book you want that I have.  "
