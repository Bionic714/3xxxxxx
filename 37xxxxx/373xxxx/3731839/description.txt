There are so many collections of Irish and Celtic music filled with music by Clannad, Enya and Loreena McKennitt.

This is a collection of the new and exiting traditional irish folk music that I listen to and play, and that I would want all of you to experience.


Featuring:

Dervish,
Flook,
Lunasa,
Cara,
Deanta,
Solas,
Krack,
Mairtin O┬┤Connor and
Beoga


Enjoy!
