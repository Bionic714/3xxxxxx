,The_Most_Important_Movie,2007-07-27T19:36Z,"Look at this for example: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3628508/

Idiot.

STFU please."
,The_Most_Important_Movie,2007-07-27T19:50Z,"Just download two of them and you'll see that it's not the same file.

I'll say again:

It's raw news footage, which has been splitted into multiple individual files. The names are the timestamps of when it was recorded.

You could also browse around on archive.org to learn how it works... for example: http://ia331335.us.archive.org/2/items/nbc200109131032-1113/ has everything for NBC - 2001.09.13 - 10:32 to 11:13

It's extremely simple and easy to understand.

But... obviously you seem to not want to learn.
And you don't want to admit that you're wrong.

Fine. Be an idiot."
