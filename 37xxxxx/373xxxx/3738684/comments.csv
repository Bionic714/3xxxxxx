Check out this link: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3775675/Microsoft_Office_Home_and_Student_2007_Activation_Keys

I just downloaded the word file with about 10 codes. I havent tried them yet so I am not positive if they are legit.

But it doesnt hurt to give it a shot. "

,madcapper66,2008-02-26T22:55Z,"In the installation notes, what is meant by 'Install needed pach or software'?  What needed patch or software are you referring to?  No information is given."
,jasperpie,2008-03-05T15:29Z,"I might be really dumb here - but new to this downloading stuff.    I have downloaded the office complete pack (obviously) - but it is saved as ""Microsoft Office 2007 All-In-One.iso"" - When i try to open the file i have the error message ""Windows cannot open this file - to open this, windows needs to know what program created it....blah blah blah""    -   how am i able to extract the relevant files from this.

do i just use something like ""power iso"" or something - or will it be something i'm missing on the pc restricting me from accessing the file.

any advice welcome  - please PM me if you can jasperpie@hotmail.co.uk"
,jasperpie,2008-03-05T18:08Z,"forget last comment - just had to run through winrar  - all sorted and working sweet i think.

spot on"
,mr.ryhage,2008-03-09T07:56Z,"Hello im swedish and i dont really understand where i even should open the notepad file and whrite that thing about never installed. I have done a search on my computor and it says that there is no ""12office"" as it says in the readme file. "
,mobfrozen,2008-03-09T17:32Z,seeding with fiber optics since it works :D
,filecore,2008-03-19T10:25Z,"@mr.ryhage

It's not ""12Office"", it's ""Office 12"" - the backslashes are all missing from the instructions. It should be:

C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Office 12\Office Setup Controller\Proof.en\Proof.xml"
,cadams221,2008-03-28T06:04Z,"I couldn't get it to work.  I got into the file and changed everything, but everytime I tried to save I got the same error.  That the file that I was overwriting couldn't be found>?!"
,bwaf,2008-04-06T14:53Z,Works Great!!
,bwaf,2008-04-06T19:50Z,"It should be:

,tengli,2008-04-10T21:39Z,i installed the home and student one first and every thing worked fine for a month or so then the office got locked because i don't have the product key.. i just installed pro let's see how long it will take
,crescs,2008-04-21T16:54Z,"Worked fine for a week, but now it wants a product key and has blocked me from using it."
,JoJoey,2008-04-22T21:01Z,I installed it... found and replace what it had to be replaced.. rebooted and open word... it opened but wouldnt let me do anything... could anyone please tell me what i did wrong?.. thanks!
,peekaysee,2008-04-24T10:51Z,Well I've just downloaded and installed Office Professional in accordance with the directions issued. Everything works fine. One thing to watch out for when you first run the programme is a splash screen inviting you to update and keep in touch on the net. Uncheck everything and refuse any contact before you go any further
,kmanfromx,2008-04-24T18:21Z,does it have Outlook with business contact manager?
,peekaysee,2008-04-25T18:20Z,I've checked my copy of Professional. It's not included with Outlook there
,camo12345,2008-04-26T03:13Z,"come on people, seed, seed, seed !!!!"
,bancapitalism,2008-04-30T10:36Z,"installed it. followed instructions and it worked fine. NO viruses or adware. Thank you 
Remember, step 3 in the installation process..the file you need is ;
C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Office12\Office Setup Controller\Proof.en\Proof.xml

good luck, and keep the pirates going."
,crescs,2008-05-05T18:49Z,This is no good for Vista. It works for about 2 weeks then freezes. You can replace the proof.en file once again but after that it doesn't recognize the change in the file. I also have it on XP and it works fine. if anyone has a solution post a comment.
,omega_iteration,2008-05-12T06:06Z,"Ha!!! Thankyou for the great DL. Burned the iso to disk and installed like you said. Hell, even used the XML editor that comes with professional to edit Proof.xml

you rock!!!"
,dietz557,2008-05-14T04:26Z,hey man does this have the serial code with it?
,dietz557,2008-05-14T04:36Z,or does that change you made to the file make it so it needs no code?

,denjaydenden,2008-06-18T01:43Z,"I was wondering if anyone can help me.  I installed first the profesional one, then got rid of it and installed the standard.  In both cases I lost the use of my outlook.  I can receive e-mail, but can not send them.  I followed the instructions when starting it.  I just not sure what I've done wrong"

,SirCloodie,2009-02-25T11:35Z,"I'm having a problem with this on Vista! After a few weeks it freezes up and I can't use it at all.

I can't edit previous documents or make new ones.

I've checked then enProof.xml file, and nothing's changed there. 

Any ideas??"
,hune2521,2009-05-30T09:56Z,"Ok downloaded fine....looks great too BUT how the hell do you replace the text in the XML file???? Somebody please help me!!!

,asustud3,2010-02-02T02:26Z,"I have spent lots and lots of time following the directions to try to get this software working and it is not working!!!! I wouldn't waist my time people, save time and get one that actually works as instructed!!! Peace"
,ncrsty,2010-02-06T00:43Z,"I downloaded and installed this torrent about one week ago on my Windows 7 Ultimate PC.  I followed the instructions, installed Office 2007 Professional only, everything worked great and I used the heck out of Outlook, Excel and Word for a week.  However, today, Office has stopped working:  in Outlook, the ""new"", ""forward"", and ""reply"" buttons are all permanently grayed out throughout the software making it impossible to create any new emails (although it still downloads email fine).  In Excel, the ""new"" and ""save"" buttons are grayed out, making it unusable, although I can still open and edit documents.  So long story short, the software figured out that it's not legit, and basically disabled itself.  It was nice while it lasted though!"
,javimetal,2010-04-21T02:54Z,was nice while it lasted but i think it just got patched mine was working fine & they just locked it up none of the buttons/ribbons worked they got lucked up & askes to get a lisense i still rated it + since i had it for a long time thanks alot
,Jose7185,2010-05-14T23:33Z,"Note: The hack may work for 60 days only. To make this hack fully working, try to delete additional file below, probably has to be deleted every two months:

Or,

C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\OFFICE\DATA (for Windows 7 and Vista)"

,quartzicicle,2011-01-12T21:56Z,"BRILLIANT!!!!
Easy as anything. I found it better to save XML file then copy and paste / replace as nitepad would not allow me to save changes to editied XML.
Great download.......thanxs!!!"

thank you :D"
,harimo93,2012-01-27T18:31Z,"Just installed and works fine!! Here's what I did.
Thanks to Daemon Tools I didnt have to burn a CD so I installed Microsoft Office. Then I did the ""never installed"" replacement thing as in the description. Like some people I had ""access denied"" when I tried to save it. What I did is copy paste the whole xml files, saved it somewhere with the name Proof then paste it and replaced the older file. Hope it helps! 
Thanks sukciuzz !"
,giddadd,2012-05-09T00:05Z,"Thanks for the torrent!
Everything works just fine!"
,raijuuxo6,2012-05-24T10:43Z,"for those who get the ""access denied"" in saving the .XML file, I tried messing around with the Properties of that .XML file.. 

Security> Edit 
and I checked the 'Full Control' under the Allow checkboxes.. 

I hope this helped. "
