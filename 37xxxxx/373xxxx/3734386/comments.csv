,pagh,2007-07-24T19:33Z,"Does anyone have a serial? Have tried several for the Beta`s, but doesn`t work, and there doesnt seem to be any included in this release."
,zathire,2007-10-01T09:27Z,Anyone have the RTM version?
,XweAponX,2008-07-18T06:16Z,"Does this actually REQUIRE a proguckt ID to install? Cos the one I got you can leave it BLANK and you get 30 day eval... Which gives you nuff time to locate various Cracks.

I'm hoping that the Vista Developer Activator I got will work with this."
