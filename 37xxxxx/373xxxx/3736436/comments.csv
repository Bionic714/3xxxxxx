,Steve296,2007-07-13T14:29Z,Can you please seed for a while? Thanks
,DannOrly,2007-07-17T02:20Z,I've been seeding non-stop since I uploaded this.
,jesperoland,2007-07-23T05:03Z,"please don't upload it as on rar archive. make one rar for each episode, since people often don't need them all"
,DannOrly,2007-07-23T20:46Z,"Jesper, I have 168 leechers as of this very second downloading this file. If you care so much about uploading individual files, why don't you download it, make all 23 into individual RAR files and upload them as torrents? If you don't want to download this file then don't."
,jesperoland,2007-07-23T23:41Z,"Nobody is talking about uploading them individually! You should just seed a directory with all the files, so that people can pick out the files they need. Not make a torrent for each episode. That is the normal way of seeding complete seasons!

It is normal practice to not put it all into one archive. Many people would like to download only selected episodes, and some would like to download one episode, and check the quality before downloading the rest.

So stop whining about a helpfull suggestion. If you don't care about making it practical for the downloaders, then why upload it at all."
,DannOrly,2007-07-24T00:51Z,"This makes it smaller, and easier, for me. I don't think the 167 people leeching off my blood are complaining. I could always cancel this, cut them all off and then no one gets anything. I was just doing this for a friend originally until everyone started downloading. As soon as theres a few seeders I'm done uploading this."
,the_newb,2007-07-25T23:49Z,"dann can you please seed this, its really an appreciated torrent, i am showing 50 peers and 0 seeds so would be well peeved if i cant get it all. dont listen to those complaining non seeding idiots who steal and then run without a care for anyone else. i will seed when i have it for a while."
,DannOrly,2007-07-26T20:46Z,"Thanks mrbors. It took me such a long time to download these episodes repeatedly and figure out which ones work and which dont... these are actually all from the same guy, he does some darned good work.

newb, ive been non stop seeding for weeks, I'm not sure what the problem with your connection may be."
,Steve296,2007-07-28T10:28Z,"Thanks Dann for seeding, it finally came down for me, i'll try to seed it for a ""longer peroid"" (although maybe i'll switch my comp off every 2-3 nights, because of my parents)..."
,ash19,2007-07-28T19:17Z,Please seed! Thankyou
,shin0r,2007-07-30T16:49Z,"Great, many thanks uploader! I presume these are xvid encoded?"
,DannOrly,2007-07-30T22:46Z,"Thanks Steve. Seed if you can, if not there will be others who can do so.

shin, I believe they are. Can't remember honestly. I use VLC Media Player to view all of my files and it worked great on my newly reformatted comp"

,smileyeagle,2007-12-02T15:49Z,Any idea what the quality of the individual episodes is?  Is it around 700MB per episode?

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3825456/Heroes_Season_One_(All_23_Individual_episodes_)

As when I uploaded this I was a noob and didn't know you could seed a folder :X sorry"
,hcarter50,2008-02-22T02:10Z,im finished im seeding now 
,DannOrly,2008-02-26T21:24Z,"Good shit, keep it coming"
,oggologgo,2008-02-28T00:55Z,"Oh how damn annoying. All episodes in ONE file!

Then you have to wait for the whole damn thing to download before you can start watching, and you have to download them all.

As someone else already said. Put them into seperate rar files. NO, you do NOT save any filesize by putting them into one rar. Infact I doubt you save any filesize by putting into rar AT ALL!

Everybody do everybody a favor, and never make torrents like this one."
,oggologgo,2008-02-28T00:58Z,"Dude, what do you mean you didn't know you could  seed a folder. The user jesperoland clearly told you that, and you just called him a noob for telling you. Duh!"
,oggologgo,2008-02-28T01:00Z,"Anyway, I am a noob to for not noticing your post about making a new torrent before I bitched about it."
,DannOrly,2008-03-12T00:25Z,"lol, self ownage."
,hcarter50,2008-03-22T17:26Z,ok guys i have reached my goal.. i have seeded 15 gb .. im cutting off all the leechers sorry ... thanks to everyone who seeded this to make it possible for me to get.. ok now that im done with this speech lmao .. im out peace
,DannOrly,2008-03-26T07:34Z,"We need more seeders like you, carter. Thanks for seeding."
,sonofluger,2008-08-30T08:50Z,"yo,
