,neomiko,2007-07-09T23:48Z,"Yep, I installed from the iso file afterwards making the it from my cd, on my laptop with win xp and the latest autopatcher and the latest k-lite codec pack and it was buggy, so there may be some incompatibility with some codecs or with DirectX, dunno."
,neomiko,2007-07-10T00:18Z,"Well After some googling, found a solution:

""Try doing this:
search your computer for Dxdiag, when you find it, run it, and go to the sound tab. lower the acceleration to basic and try running RE3. It worked perfectly that way for me. If it doesn't work, try lowering it to none.""

,Vanterion,2008-01-22T13:15Z,"Why is there no music in the game. I remember music plays when the zombies surround Jill at the beginning and she barges through the door and runs down the dark alley. There's also soft music that plays during the scene with Jill and the dead little girl's father.

What's wrong?"
,Joni_SX,2008-03-20T05:18Z,"I have the same problem as you Vanterion... I cant hear any dialog between characters, neither music... Has anyone found a solution for this?"

,Umbra366,2008-04-27T19:09Z,"For those who get a while blank screen when you load up the game, run the .exe directly from your installation location (e.g. .../Capcom/ResidentEvil3). Do NOT run ResidentEvil3_menu, run ResidentEvil3."
,Umbra366,2008-04-27T19:12Z,"Oh, and if the problem continues, run the R3Setup and chose the windowed mode. You can set the resolution to the highest so you don't get a small box for a window."

,Grifmik,2008-05-15T17:51Z,"I'm playing this in windows Vista everything works fine except the backround have huge square cuts in them and its really annoying.

Capcom stated that there's an issue the way windows XP handles the sound hardware aceleration that makes the game freeze on the ""farewell..."" screen. They gave the solution i put above."

,Bake420,2008-07-13T16:11Z,"when i run ResidentEvil3 all i get is a black screen and this box says input not supported, i can hear the music in the background but no picture, what do i do?"
,king_Crip,2009-07-12T02:33Z,"If it keeps freezing at the ""Farewell to my life"" thing, its because XP has a problem handling the direct sounds.

1: Go to the run command and type down ""dxdiag""
2: Go to the sound tab
3: Where it says DirectX Features, there should be something like Hardware sound Acceleration
4: Switch the acceleration to Basic Acceleration or No Acceleration
5: Exit (It will automatically save)

this worked for me also if the resolution is set to high you'll have squares on the screen to fix this push F2 or F3 (cant remember) but it'll give you some options i recommend full screen on the second resolution (that worked for me)

i know this has already been posted but im just witting some decent instructions because all the other RE3 torrents users have been having this problem"

Does anybody notice that some background music during cutscenes are missing and that NO cgi movies play? I tried checking the ""play movies"" box but still nothing!

I half expected to see the tyrant kill off that vested dude, but when the movie was supposed to play, it just skips ahead to where you have to choose.  Help?"

,ScamWoW,2010-05-01T07:24Z,"  Unlimited ammo weapons
Before starting a regular game, start Mercenaries once. No matter whom you will choose and how long you will last,
providing you will earn at least one $. Now, quit the game and edit the file bio3.ini in its directory. You should see
a following text at the end of the file:

[Data]
Data00=

After this goes a 20 characters long digit and letter seqence. Now, replace everything with the following:

[Data]
Data00=8e82aac62274044c57ab
Data01=908aabc66274a606b4b5
Data02=bc88abc66274c6924499
Data03=e48eabc66274f7ab54c1

If you did everything correctly, you should now have Assault Rifle, Gatling and Rocket Launcher with unlimited ammo in your chest at your save spots enjoy. OH!! and thank you works like a charm and im using vista 32 bit"

,Banzay27,2011-01-12T23:04Z,"This torrent is smart, thanks for sharing.

Installed and played thru this oldie without a hitch on Windows 7 64-bit.
It's been a while since I finished, but I don't recall having to make any adjustments or apply any fixes.

One of the F keys will open up a window with more options than just the Video tab you get from the Launcher. You'll see the controls there and such, it's helpful.

Never got to finish this game on my Dreamcast. Albeit wee old by now, I'm glad I got around to finishing it. The last true Resident Evil, to date; actual survival-horror and not plainly a shooter with the occasional puzzle as the 2 following sequels are."
,MaCVaLLeY,2011-04-12T01:50Z,downloaded the game and installed it then i encountered the problem of the sound acceleration so i decreased it to no acceleration and it worked great but i still can't run the Merce so what can i do ?! if i can't run the Merc i can't get the infinite ammo :s ?!
