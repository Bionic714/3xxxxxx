in first level, once you go through the gate,  and you are asked to summon minions (I have lifeforce enough for 3 minions.)

It tells me to Hold Shift and Right Mouse key buttons.   

Thats what I do, but it wont work :S No minions are spawned :S:S:S

I put in patch and evrything but minions still wont spawn there :S How the hell am I supposed to finish the game???? :S:S:S:S:S"
