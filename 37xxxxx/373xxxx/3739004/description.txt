Overlord is a groundbreaking, completely original action adventure,
set in a seriously warped fantasy world. Controlling a mysterious figure
that has inherited the legacy of the evil, long-dead Overlord, the player
emerges, near death, from the ruins of the old Overlord?s Dark Tower.
Only the player?s actions will determine if they will rise to become
the new all-powerful Overlord; it?s all down to how much of a bad ass
they want to be in order to succeed...evil or really evil! Played out
with plenty of black humor and dark irony, the game will immerse players
in twisted parodies of classic fantasy scenarios and characters.

Features:

* Overlord's key innovation is the introduction of an array of
impish creatures ' the Minions. They believe you are the old Overlord
reborn and will use their unique skills to fetch, fight and die for you.

* Throughout the game players will actively control a horde of these
gremlin-like critters and they'll follow your every instruction
no matter how despotic or, for the Minions, life threatening it is.
