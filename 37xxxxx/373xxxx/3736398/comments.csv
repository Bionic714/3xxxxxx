Hmm, let's see, who has F-16's, a multi-billion dollar military budget, is the largest recipient of u.s. military aid and has an income level similar to other developed countries?  Who are the ones with no armed vehicles of any sort, living in abject poverty, abducted from their homes at will by an occupation army?

I don't know why those Palestinians don't just lie down and die like good little guys.  Instead they're fighting back.  It just makes no sense."
