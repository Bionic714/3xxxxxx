,ravenheart1982,2007-07-08T02:09Z,"Why go to the effort of recording and editing this and then convert it into such a shit format? 

I hope someone seeds a real DVD version of this."
,racvets1,2007-07-08T02:40Z,"I didn't do any editing... Turned on TiVo, hit capture on a Hardware Divx encoder, and hit stop at the end. No post processing. If you download it, there is a little at the beginning and end with commercials (under 3 seconds)

And I don't think a DVD exists yet because they were recorded at concerts TODAY!!!"
,racvets1,2007-07-08T03:43Z,"Anyone have suggestions on what you want, I am a little limited on bandwidth (about 20KB/s upload), so I won't release them all at once. Once it gets seeded by everyone, I can release another. Also, I need to finish capturing them all. I am a little behind right now..."
,djphazer,2007-07-08T08:15Z,"We found another part of the LP performance that wasn't included in this torrent (performance of ""Bleed It Out"")...

I'm going to bed right now though. But tomorrow, I'll post a new torrent with the same first 4 parts, so all you who have already downloaded (or are downloading) this torrent can save to the same folder and just resume to get the 5th part."
