From the suburbs of Stockholm in the early 90┬┤s, a band called Yankee Rose made a great impact on the local scene. Influenced by great artists like Whitesnake, Poison, Yngwie Malmsteen, Motley Crue, Skid Row to name a few, Yankee Rose shaped their own sound by hard work and a lot passion. It has now been confirmed that the band will 
reunite in 2007 for one more album!

This is the first two samples from the pre production:

Pedal to the Metal
Was written by Mike Hill in April 2007. A demo of that song was recorded (with Mike's brother, Pete former member of Construcdead and now in GodSic, so that the Yankee Rose members could listen in on it. The Pre prod was recorded in one day in Chris Twoish studio in May 2007. We are very satisfied with the result and I am pretty sure you will be too.

Ghost Ride
Was first recorded during one of Yankee Rose jam sessions in 1992. The band members decided that they were going to record a new version of it. It was recorded in Mr. Twoish studios in June 2007.
