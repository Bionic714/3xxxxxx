You wouldn't have something similar to this for the Netherlands / Benelux / EU per chance? *blush*

Anyway, I'm sure you'll be busy for a while with today's uploads. I thank you for those. Grabbing 'em all. Your huble leecher,

,4X-AXG,2007-07-09T00:50Z,"hehe nuff, there isn't anything like this out there for europe I'm afraid..only thing is FSX Vector but it's hardly to be compared to UT
we'll have to wait for SS to release their UT Europe I'm afraid!"
,jimbob43,2007-07-10T05:56Z,Nice job Sparky
,eNuffSaid,2007-07-10T09:07Z,"Hello 4X-AXG,

Thanks for your reply. Yes, I noticed VFR The Netherlands is not out yet. Europe would be nice, but The Netherlands has my vote. I'm in no hurry, 4X. My PC can't run FSX right now. I plan to upgrade after the summer. Hopefully after ATI have launched their DirX 10 video card.

Thanks for all you AWESOME Flight Sim uploads, mate. You got me coming back for more. Thanks very much. 

Mvg,
'nuff :)"
,4X-AXG,2007-07-14T11:28Z,well VFR The Netherlands is out but not for FSX I think..
