,RawThang,2007-07-24T03:12Z,seed plz
,2RAGNAR,2007-09-01T12:58Z,this is NOT the Fritz Lang classic (but some anime)
,shabutie78,2007-09-21T08:08Z,"how do you watch this video?
i have the k-lite mega codec pack 3.4.5 and im using vlc to play it.
when i open it, theres no video, no sound, the progress bar just slowly moves to the right, it takes about 35 seconds for the ""movie"" to finish.
any suggestions please? this took very long to download."
,ironwhimp,2008-02-06T18:51Z,"This should work with VLC ""out of the box"", so to speak.
Run a manual hash check on the downloaded file with your BitTorrent client to make sure the .avi file hasn't been corrupted.
If it still doesn't work, try updating VLC (if there's a codec problem) or try another player (like media player classic or mplayer [www.mplayerhq.hu]). If it still doesn't work, try to redownload the movie.
Cheers!"

Cheerz!"
,Skerv,2009-03-10T08:21Z,"@2RAGNAR

The Fritz Lang classic wasn't made in 2002 like this file says, dumbass.  The other 95% of Metropolis files are the one you're looking for."
,l2ick,2009-03-14T17:46Z,this was very good quality. thank you
,jcdvsrbld,2009-10-09T09:00Z,im actually suprised to find that someone is stupid enough to post that this isnt an ancient film when the year is CLEARLY 2002. dumbass 2ragnar

,doncher12,2011-01-11T14:22Z,dude im a fan of yours...
,zookap,2011-02-16T04:26Z,"I will most likely prefer the 1927 classic version of this movie by Fritz Lang (one of the best movies from one of the best directors ever,) but such a fantastic story is definitely a perfect candidate for an amine. Can't wait to watch it! "
,zookap,2011-02-16T04:27Z,Hey.... Wasn't this released in 2001?
