Wow!
This is nostalgia at its best. One of the best bands in Stockholm, Sweden of the early 90s. From the suburbs of Stockholm in early 90s a band called Yankee Rose made a great impact on the local scene. Influenced by great artists like Whitesnake, Guns n Roses, Yngwie Malmsteen, Motley Crue, Skid Row to name a few, Yankee Rose shaped their own sound by hard work and a lot passion.This EP was never released and there are only 1000 copies out there. I found it in a second hand cd-shop. It was expensive but I am telling you right now...It was worth it! Yankee Rose has reunited for one more album. Listen to their new tunes.
