True Romance är en av de bästa filmerna genom tiderna om du frågar mig.

"Think of "True Romance" as a cousin to "Reservoir Dogs" and a prequel to "Pulp Fiction." Quentin Tarantino wrote all three movies in a brief spurt of 

creative energy hardly equalled in Hollywood history, "True Romance" preceding its more illustrious "Pulp Fiction" successor by a year or so but containing 

much the same mixture of black humor, violence, romance, and action." John J. Puccio, DVD Town

En av de första replikerna går så här:

Elvis look good. I ain´t no fag but Elvis is prettier than most women, most women. Ill always said, If I had to fuck a guy, I mean if my life depended on it, Ill fuck elvis.

Och de coola citaten bara haglar i denna film.

"He must have thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?"

"If there's one thing this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not need it than to need a gun and not have it."

"If you gave me a million years to ponder, I would never have guessed that true romance and Detroit would ever go together."

"If that's true, then tell me, 'Am I Lying?"

"Do I look like a beautiful blonde with big tits, and a pussy that tastes like ice cream?.....then why are you lying to me?"

"The first time you kill somebody, that's hardest one....the second one ain't no fucking mardi gras, but it's still hard. The third one....you level off. 

...Now I do do it just to watch there expression change."

"Tell me I'm the dumbest motherfucker you've ever seen, or I'm gonna pump two into your face right now!"
