,lighter,2007-11-06T21:58Z,"Thank you for this, I just found out that my d/ls of ELP are a complete fuckup with most of the files containing some other song by ELP than stated. Gracenote found that out, though, to my complete surprise, when the tags started to show other titles than the filename.
So thanx again for a chance to repair more easily than renaiming everything."

I think they were the best among the progressives. They had some punch. The others didn't even have a sense of direction."
