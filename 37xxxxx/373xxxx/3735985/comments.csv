insert or mount the CD, locate the shortcut of residentevil2.exe and from properties choose compatibility tab and select win95, apply, enjoy."

,neomiko,2007-08-19T17:06Z,Found the same trouble while starting to play. something about the ffdshow decoder? at least in my case with a fresh xp install and the latest K-litemegacodec (KLM) pack there is a glitch because there are many decoders installed and KLM asks what video decoder to use. Try pressing alt+tab and select the decoder or just press enter.
,50caliber,2007-08-24T03:27Z,"yo it says to insert the leon disk when i try to play so, what do i do?"
,apansbrorsa,2007-08-28T11:23Z,"For all you people having troubles loading saved games! 
I had the same problem (save name not appearing, only showing a Leon00 waiting room file) but after  having looked around the internet quite a bit, I finally got it to work. This is what you must do:

-1- Download and install:
Download, mount and then install BOTH cds to ""C:\Resident Evil 2"". Full install! 
- IMPORTANT - you must! name the folder Resident Evil 2 and it must be placed directly under C:\   I have tried a lot of different fodler names and this is the only one working for me!

-2- Set compatibility mode for Windows 95:
Right click then choose ""explore"" 
on cd 1, locate the file RESEDENTEVIL2 (the eye icon) and right click on it. Choose ""preferences"" and then click the compatibility tab.
Then click ""Run in compatibility mode for"" and selected ""Windows 95"" Click ""execute/ok""

You must do this compatibility modification on a total of 4! different files:
 - RESIDENTEVIL2 x 2 (located in for example E:\ and F:\) One cd for Claire and one for Leon!

 - On each cd there is then one more file (located in the folder ""REGIST"") which you must also change compatibility for. 
These file names are: CLAIREP and LEONP.

-3- Changing save game folder:
Enter the game launch screen and change the SAVE GAME FOLDER to C:\Resident Evil 2.
You will get a couple of error messages, but just click past them and you will be fine eventually.

-4- Create a shortcut on your desktop:
Right click and drag the file CLAIREP(in my case as I wanted to play as Claire first) located in REGIST folder on cd1 to your desktop and then choose: ""create shortcut here"". make sure that the shortcut has the correct compatibility settings! (it should have by default)

-5- Launch game and have fun!


Notes: I tried lots of different set-ups recommended by people on different forums on the net and finally got it to work by following these above instructions.
I hope it will help you too!

Good luck!

Thank you for the guide, was a nice help. Allthough, I still have one problem: After following your four steps, when I try to launch either CD, it asks me to insert the Leon/Claire cd. When I try to play Leon, by clicking the LeonP icon, it asks me to insert the cd, allthough I already mounted the eye icon on cd2. Same thing when I try to do it with Claire.

,profesional,2007-11-12T20:22Z,"listen up yall!!!
i've found the answer for those "" insert leon/claire cd"" :
you must moun immage:
first download ""daemon tools""
install it and a new partition should appear""dvd""
right click on this new partitio and""mount immage""after that browse where you have the compressed resident evil and click open to mount it, once you did that the claire/leon icon should replace the new partition. it worked on everyone i know... and for the saving problem click on propeties -> compatibility for windows 95, and change the save game folder to a new folder created by you wich must have the adress:c:/Resident Evil 2

,FalseAccount,2008-01-13T17:43Z,does compatability 95 work for a windows xp?
,Carazide,2008-01-19T16:54Z,"Allright so, to answer a few questions:

You need Deamontools to mount the 2 files you download, how to "" Mount "" you can search for on google, or just use your brain, since it's really easy.

once you'v done that, you install the game to the default destination chosen by the game (I tried to edit it to c:/resident evil as someone said, but then the game crashed, so dont do that, just install it to the first thing it tells you.).

do this with both cd1 & cd 2, and install everything you can.

then, do the thing with windows 95 compability as described in a different post here (I did this on >>WINDOWS XP"
,Carazide,2008-01-19T16:55Z," and it worked fine. knowing microsoft, it will probably work on vista too, if vista has the option to run programms in windows 95 compability mode ( i dont know cus i dont have vista )

now, i started the game and saw the "" this game contains explicit violence and gore "" screen, and then it went black, played the movie sound, and prompted me to download a codec called "" Indeo "".  i followed the link the popup gave me, but it only took me to indeos homepage where it said that it was NOT avaliable for free download.

everyone who has been surfing the internet knows that stuff like that is a lie, and so i googled "" indeo codec "" and immedeately found a big flashing buton where it said "" Download indea codec 5.11 "" or somesuch. so i did, and the movie worked just fine.

i only have 2 problems now.

in some screens i seem to have a drastic loss of fps, and once for me the character got stuck turning left (!?)

hope this helps!

Maybe I'm wrong but as far as I know Clair isn't supposed to get a shotgun, in a regular game, what is the shotgun for Leon is the Bow gun for Clair, and on the PSX version i never saw a shotgun for Clair, so is this a glitch that it actually shows up a shotgun laying there while it should be a bow gun or what?

When I finished downloading, I mounted the ISO files with PowerISO as instructed. Created the separate save folder and everything.

Then I changed it to Intel 740 for the card user. It ran about twice, and now, after trying to run it again, it doesn't work, for both ISO files.

When I click on them, the hourglass flashes as if it were going to load for like half a second and then stops. Nothing happens.

,crimsonether,2009-07-29T17:03Z,"To everyone who experiences the save game bug:

I've discovered a quick and simple fix!

Since RE 2 can NOT read the save game files from a hard drive that's been formatted in the NTFS designation, it will show an errored file.

To fix this problem, all you need is a usb flash drive or memory stick.

Right click on the usb drive/memory stick in my computer
select format
select the FAT32 option

we're almost there!

Now, open REGEDIT find the Resident Evil 2 files, change the save game directory to your flash device, and voila!

Enjoy saving your games~

PS: If you can run RE 2 without using compatibility come(in XP) I suggest you don't. :)"

,raghu204u,2010-02-21T07:31Z,"I m suggesting u that u mount both images on a image mounting tool like daemon tool den install both CD's in a new folder named as ""C:\Resident evil 2"" insted of there default installing folder.
Now open Cd1 image & lookout for a eye icon, right click on the icon & set its compatibility to 95
there is another image where is one more eye icon set its compatibility to 95
now u have to look for regdist folder in both images. In this folder u found either ""Leon A"" or ""Claire A"" set both compatibility to 95.
Now change ur save folder to ""C:\Resident evil 2"" u got couple of error messages but dont worry just click past them & u done
Play game in any mode & save when u found ink ribbon, just beware here if ur saving put ""underscroll ( _ )"" between text i think ur not able 2 load game
The 4 load game is very easy u have to go ""C:\Resident evil 2"" folder & get the save file with ""underscroll ( _ )"" just delete ""underscrolls ( _ )"" & put space in palce of ""underscrolls ( _ )""
now u can load game easily
This trick u have 2 do only one time there is no need 2 do it again.
Just be sure u have mount both images on mounting tool(like daemon tool) & make a shortcut on the desktop of ""Leon A"" or ""Claire A"" that found in folder regdist folder in both images.

Well fella i enjoy this game & gave u 2 thumbs up for this................ENJOY"

for this game, read me before running it

,ron286,2010-04-12T12:03Z,"ok for the for everyone that cant get the save to work, try the game in compatability mode for windows 95, and no thats not a typo-windows 95......if this doesnt work run the game as administrator also and it shud sort it........u dont have to do all the shit raghu204u said(no offence mate) just make sure to run as administrator.. old games are weird that way..

for the people who are being asked to insert the cd, mount the bloody thing with daemon tools or virtual clone drive or something, 95% of the time when you download a pc game you have to mount it so dont forget..."

,Gamejunkiez,2010-09-16T17:04Z,"@MistroJoker, if I remember correct:

You can save the game by finding: Ink ribbons.
Once you done so you must find a typing machine (typewriter) to save the game.

(This will cost you 1 ink ribbon but there should be enough to find during the game.)

Hope this helps. :) "
,Exumius,2010-09-30T08:44Z,"Erm....I don't know about the other people, but I got stuck in Claire part B....I finished the game with Leon and Claire, unlocking part B for both. So I started to play Claire part B and made progress through the game till the part in the factory, where we activate the C. panel and the ""train"" starts to move underground towards the biolaboratory. 

The problem is: after activating the C. panel and entering the train, Claire talks something to Sheryl and William jump and fall down on top of train. Sheryl get scared and Claire say she'll check and get off the train. This is where we suppose to duel with William, but in my case I just run here and there...making circles, anything...the stupid boss just doesn't appear, and that's how my long history ended...stuck in a bug. Anyone know how to solve this? Is there any patch? something like that?"
,Exumius,2010-10-02T01:05Z,Correction: I played also with Leon part B....stuck exactly in same point...William doesn't appear in top of train to duel on the way to biolaboratory.
,skank1125,2010-10-20T17:37Z,"Hi guys, For anyone able to play the game but can only hear the movies (black screen), load the ISO onto a program like alcohol 120%, open the cd and set ""resident evil 2"", and all other application files in the ""regist"" folder to run in compatibility mode for windows 95. Don't think you need to Install the game after this but if your movies still don't play give it a try (check Install directory, If it's empty you havn't changed the install file on ISO to win95 compatibility). Works on windows 7, dunno about other windows systems."
,skank1125,2010-10-24T21:56Z,"Bug/crash fix: Play on other disc till next save point, E.G., if your game crashes in labs on claire, open leons disc (turn off movies and don't pick up leon's things E.G. shotgun shells!) and load claires game, play as normal till next save point and switch back to claires disc. It's a little annoying and I'm not sure why this works but save often and hopfuly when your game does crash/freeze/glitch in some way, you won't have too much to re-do."

,Antula,2011-01-09T04:47Z,"  HELP WITH LOADING GAME SAVED FILES:

                     For people who cant load saved games --- 1. for me, I am keeping the isos and mounting them on daemon tools(or any mounting program like poweriso&nero) cause I cant get no-cd cracks to work for the Leon & Claire disks, after mounting iso(HOPE YOU ALREADY KNOW HOW TO) , but if you got the no-cd cracks for your isos to work then skip the star section -> *** right click on disk drive in MY COMPUTER and click explore, this opens the folder of the iso where all the files are stored.*** 2. ---right click RESIDENTEVIL2(.exe) click properties, click COMPATIBILITY tab and click checkbox for ""run this program in compatibility mode           .(if you're only doing this to one of the iso's, make sure to do it to the other iso too Example: after making leon iso win 95 compatible, make claire iso win 95 compatible too unless you're sexist about playing her :O) 3.--- now after win 95 compatibiliting isos.... go to your Resident Evil 2 directory folder (Default location: Program Files/Capcom/Resident Evil 2 -OR- Program Files/Resident Evil 2, depends on where you saved it.) when you are inside RE2 Directory, you can save your game files just in the Directory or make your own folders called,""Leon Saves"" or ""Claire Saves"" and drag them into there,which i did, again, it is your choice. IF YOU SAVED A GAME FILE ALREADY: Right click on the file and make it Windows 95 compatible and it will load your game save next time you open the game and load. IF YOU HAVEN'T SAVED A FILE YET: Play the game and save at a typewriter...sheesh....then find that saved file on your computer (Resident Evil 2 directory) and right click and make windows 95 compatible.....

I HOPE I MADE THAT CLEAR ENOUGH PHEW (too much typing for specification....) anyways gimme feedback, im gonna go play RE2 now, just beat RE1 today :D with jill = 4:46'55 ,26 game saves.

thanks for torrent again :)"
,Conglynn,2011-01-18T20:40Z,I am having the same problem as Krozz153 is. I get the Directx failed to load message. 
,VDmaf,2011-02-03T22:52Z,"Hey guys. This is the easy way to solve your LOAD/SAVE issue. 

1. Install the game using Deamon, or just extarct it to any folder all 3 games and do it from there.
2. After Install got C:\ Disk and creat a new folder called RESIDENTEVIL2 so it look like this C:\RESIDENTEVIL2. ( no space between 2 words)
3. Go to C:\ Disk, Program Files, Capcom, Resident Evil 2, (where u install ur game).
4. Click on the ResidentEvil2 ( Looks like lizard eye) it will open AUTORUN.exe 
5. Click on SAVE GAME FOLDER , if it says error or somethink, it's ok, just wait a little and dont close it until u see it a new window pop up.
6. In that window u have to choose where u have to save ur game so select that folder we created in C:\ Disk ( C:\ResidentEvil2 ) 
7. Run the game in win 95 mode ( Right click on Leaon short cut - Properties - Compatibility. 
8. Then same Lean icon duble click to play.

THIS SHOULD WORK I GUARANTEE !!!
PS You can transport your old save's to the new Save folder and delet the old ""save"" folder or dont, but it should work anyway but just to be sure if it dont. FACEBOOK: Jay Bel"

And yes, it does work. I followed these myself. In order for you to see the movies and cutscenes, you need to install one of the drivers that it suggests to install. It comes right after Directx 6. I installed it and the movies worked.

Although, I really don't like how the controls are. It's a bit hard to aim. Anyone know how to get auto-aim?"
