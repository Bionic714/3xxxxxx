OVERVIEW

Great White have had one hell of a ride. TheyÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ve had break upÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s and reunions, bust ups and of course the infamous burn-down. Literally picking themselves up from the ashes of a tragic club fire that took 100 people and one if its own members, Great White have released what they dub their comeback album. The classic line-up is here and its set to be released on their 25th Anniversary.

SONGS

Back To Rhythm sounds as it should. Stomping rhythm in a straight ahead rocker, from all signs, they ARE back in the rhythm. More reflective is the great Here Goes My Head Again, and the album is better for it. We can hear Beatles influence, one of the best songs from these guys for a long while. Take Me Down Tonight is similar and is a nice number. 1st ballad Play On is heartfelt and a well led, great, classic sounding tune. Was It The Night is yet another reflective song, its low-tempo moodiness make it a real winner, another album highlight (nice lead-work too!). Celebratory number IÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½m Alive canÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t help but make you feel good, unexpected, but certainly not unwanted. Next up the mid-tempo anthem Still Hungry. Classic Great White. Standing On The Edge is a stock-sounding blues rocker, but How Far Is Heaven? Certainly isnÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t. What we find is a delicate ballad that wears its heart on its sleeve. Neighbourhood is another top melodic mid-paced rocker and  Just Yesterday is a superb bitter-sweet ballad.

CONCLUSION

Although come-back gets thrown around sometimes, if you send an album to Saviours Of Rock with come-back stuck to a classic rock bands nameÃ¢ï¿½Â¦youÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½d better bring it.

Truth be told, I was ready to be bored with this one. Boring it is not. Like several hard rockers, sometimes the tone of a constant beat can grate and become repetitive. I guess that is what I expected. I was fooled, because this truly is a great come-back album.

Great White donÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t just return with what they do best, but push their limits and show a depth that they have never managed before. The last few years have no-doubt been hard on the guys, and it really shows in the style and lyrics. It is very laid back, and fans may be deterred at first, but it is great in different way.
Not a bad song in the bunch, and some truly great moments. The only gripe I have is the very average production. Instead of just using Michael, they couldÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ve really used an extra punch and a high-end producer to really flush these songs out, itÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s a pity because under the low sonics, lay 11 great, Great White numbers. Come-back indeed. Maybe their last? Certainly one of their best.
