We had to be very careful how they were loaded due to weight distribution....only aircraft we dealt with that carried it's own spare tire. We had to actually get weights of passengers after the one crashed in Charlotte.

When I went to the tower...the Beech was the king of the ramp. While we had to hold out the Dash 8s & the jets due to a lack of gates...the Beech could park & be turned out from anywhere.

Seems the bigger the plane, the bigger the pilot's ego. I used to hold the 330s & 340s from pushing back just to clear the Beech for taxi....used to really piss them off but the Air Midwest pilots loved us for that."
