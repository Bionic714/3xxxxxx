It's the beginning of an exciting magical journey for 14 lucky children. 
A master magician, the Sorcerer, is looking for an apprentice and has 
hand-picked 7 boys and 7 girls to attend his magic school where they 
will compete with each other for the title of The Sorcerer's Apprentice. 
On arrival at their new school the 14 spell bound children come face 
to face with the Sorcerer, are introduced to the magic school rules 
and witness the mysteries of magic first hand.

A kid's game show? Well it's rather fun, in a Harry Potter way.
