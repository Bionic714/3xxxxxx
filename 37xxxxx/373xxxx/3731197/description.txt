┬╢ 	Sandra Dee and Troy Donahue star in this enduring favorite 
about desire and tumult at an elite Maine resort, from the bestseller by 
Sloan Wilson (The Man In The Gray Flannel Suit). In his first movie 
lead, Donahue is strong, handsome and unshakably devoted as lovestruck 
Johnny Hunter. And 17-year-old Dee is pixieish Molly, a woman/child 
struggling to cope with adult emotions. Set to a lush Max Steiner score 
that produced one of the most unforgettable movie themes ever, this 
box-office hit also stars adults (Dorothy McGuire, Richard Egan, 
Arthur Kennedy, Constance Ford) also romantically at odds. As Johnny, 
Molly and their parents discover, love will find a way. They've already 
found the locale: A Summer Place.
