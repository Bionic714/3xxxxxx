In 1994, White Wolf Game Studios picked up the license to produce an RPG based on a highly unlikely license-- the Street Fighter series of video games. The RPG itself, while incredibly well-done, didn't meet with much commerical success and was quickly cancelled.

However, there is an active fanbase still using this gem of a pen-and-paper game-- including producing new material for it-- and as both an unusual and elegant implementation of their Storyteller mechanics, deserves to be preserved for posterity.

This compilation includes all of the published sourcebooks for the game, the "Shades of Gray" adventure released with the Storyteller's Screen, and an article from Inphobia Magazine describing the villainous Bison's secret apprentices.
