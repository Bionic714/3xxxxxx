I dont know how he will take it but i hope that he will be glad that thousands of people got this and not just the regular PC-games, action movies, and porn that the internet supplies. In the letter i will quote some of the wonderful PMs i have gotten from around the world about this material. If it is something, anything, you would like Jack to hear: PM me and tell it or write it here at this page. We have heard his storys, now i will tell him ours. ;-)

Blessings

Thanks for uploading all the Jack Kornfield's stuff. I agree that it makes a refreshing change from a lot of the things available, not just on the internet but also in bookshops.
I'm not sure how I'd feel if my stuff was spread over the internet like this...but perhaps a little better if I knew that, as it has done to me, torrent files actually motivated people to buy titles from bookshops (as well as sharing them with friends). Or is that a little materialistic of me?
Anyway, thanks a lot! "

,manisvans,2007-10-31T00:53Z,"He´ll hopefully wake you up.  They´re not all like that those buddhist monks, all calm and friendly alright, but they don´t all send a ""Secret Flying Hidden Crane Style"" to your spirit like Jack Kornfield
You won't even know what hit you. Was it silence ?"
