I cant open the .cue files. Get error message with Deamon tools, Alchol 120% and Power ISO."
,Kalath,2007-07-12T15:34Z,"@ Ninnisen
Open the cue file with notepad, and change the ""FILE"" name thing, to the name of the audiofile. But it doesn't matter, because the .cue file isn't correctly times at all, it's like 1 minute differences on all songs."
,Ninnisen,2007-07-12T18:04Z,"thnx Kalath, but I still wont get the mp3 one by one. "
,BassFreak,2007-07-12T19:49Z,är det inte i mp3? 
,komplettidiot,2007-07-12T20:20Z,"Its two mp3 files, one for each CD cause its not splitted up.
You must use a CUE splitter to split of the mp3, search on google.

Here's the CUE fix http://home.no.net/gsiden/VA-Summer_Dance_Mania_2007-CUEFIX-READ_NFO-2CD-2007-SDS.rar"

,Crackzter,2007-07-19T18:57Z,"Lol why not split the files?
And for people who needs exactly this version of the album, just burn and extract the tracks, like when you brought a normal CD."
