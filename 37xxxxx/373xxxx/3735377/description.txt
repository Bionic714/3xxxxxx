SYNOPSIS: Commencing with the dual murder of Mallorys sexually abusive father (Rodney Dangerfield) and grossly negligent mother (Edie McClurg), the anomic couple (Woody Harrison & Juliette Lewis) take off on a three-week killing spree across the country, telling everyone who they are so that they get the credit for their crimes. The media are immediately enthralled with the couple, especially Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr.), the bloodthirsty host of a tabloid TV show who follows their every move. By the time theyre finally arrested, theyve become such huge media stars that the cops treat them more like celebrities than criminals. Even the maniacal limelight-hogging warden of the Batongaville State Prison, Dwight McClusky (Tommy Lee Jones), is in awe.
