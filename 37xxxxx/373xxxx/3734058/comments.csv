,wyntermute,2008-11-26T20:16Z,"copied the crack as instructed, tried to run this and vista gave me a compatibility error.  so i dunno about other windows, but don't use this for vista.  my bad, maybe. :)"

THANKS !!!!
PEOPLE, DOWNLOAD IT!!!!!!!!!"
,jenchocolate,2009-01-24T09:23Z,"Fast download and virus-free. Thanks.
Now, my problem is, there's two APPLICATION file inside the folder. Which one should I install? The other one is inside the folder named ""pro""..."
,7171974,2009-02-05T19:33Z,"Agreed...this is not a good product. Crashed my computer and made me have to restore to a previous restore point.

Might only be a Vista issue though...I have had a few programs that cause crashing from compatibility issues.....

Just remember sometimes Microsoft knows best...and if the pop up says it might cause damage to your computer....don't click install regardless like I did...*smacks forehead*"
,raluca_maria,2009-04-01T16:47Z,"thanx so much, super speed and works just fine!!! :)"
,TorChache,2009-06-30T09:19Z,I have Vista 64Bit and I couldn't run this. It gave me a compatibility error and said that running it could cause problems starting up in the future. It was a fast download though... xD

,lunatik3904,2009-11-18T15:25Z,"Does this one works with Windows 7 build 7100?
'Cuz I don't wanna download this if it's not gonna work."
,madbilly,2010-01-03T21:04Z,"hehe. took me about 10 minutes to fix problems caused by virus.
DONT believe comments of assholes who says ""it works greaaat!""
Dont trust every uploader whos got skull nd bones next to his name. I think some kind of anti-piracy raid have started on TPB.
this is 2nd bad torrent i've downloaded in just one day (first one came with spyware), also from ""Trusted"" uploader."
,schwang,2010-01-23T15:29Z,Crashed my 32 vista. Recovery very difficult.
,Gir_King_of_Tacos,2010-03-08T09:53Z,"First off for those who could not get it to work if you are using 98/ME/Vista/7 just forget about it if you would have read the Alchohol site itself it tells you that this version will not run on those. Second for those of you that aren't running one of those do a fresh Install, move the crack file from the Pro folder into Alchohol's main Directory, then restart your computer.  It worked like a Charm for me and no joke I did something to piss off the God of technology all of it hates me, but this works fine for me. 


P.S. I will be Seeding pretty much indefinitely or atleast while I have Utorrent running which is most of the time "
,Reign1030,2010-05-03T19:32Z,Works perfectly on xp. Thanks
,paradoxal47,2011-06-21T16:19Z,Funciona. Obrigado.
