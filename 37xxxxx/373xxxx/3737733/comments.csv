Each film has been released in an edition of ten -- the discs are housed in lavish sculptural packaging and individually signed and numbered by Barney . Single discs have sold at auction for over $385,000.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THANKYOU"
,Saurat,2007-11-22T11:19Z,Sorry but I found video quality unwatchable - one frame moving every five seconds or so. Anyone else having this problem? I have a fairly old computer but other downloads haven't presented this problem.

Thank you Beksinski."

If you like this crap, you probably think Tracey Emin is amazing and has lots to say."
,anabee,2009-08-08T04:55Z,ok yes! I am having the same problem Saurat had.  I'm trying to watch these on VLC and it's freezing up - totally unwatchable.  The full file is there and I can access the actual frames but it won't play. help please!!!
