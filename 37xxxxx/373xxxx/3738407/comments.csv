,KayossZero,2009-02-01T04:48Z,"To play the music for this game use the patch located here. http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fctpax-cheater.narod.ru%2Fhtmldocs%2Fturok.htm%23turok_patch&sl=ru&tl=en&hl=en&ie=UTF-8 make sure your Turok 2 game .exe file is Turok2.exe

Tested and 100% fully working music using the mounted game or a burned disc /w this patch."
,JPeterson,2009-07-02T02:48Z,Do you also have Turok: Dinosaur Hunter (1997)?
,JPeterson,2009-07-04T22:59Z,KayossZero: Is there some way to play the music from the hard drive without mounting the iso? Just wondering.
,KayossZero,2009-07-06T00:18Z,"JPeterson, well my fix doesn't even really apply to this version since it's a rip, however to answer your question no, unless you rip the music from the game its self (or find the soundtrack online) you need the russian music patch fix and either A: a properly burned copy of the game in your cd drive or B: a properly ripped image file mounted."
