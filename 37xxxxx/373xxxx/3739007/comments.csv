,bobdel,2008-01-29T05:24Z,"Why is there Naruto Shippuuden Ep 1-19 Naruto  included?

I was jsut wanting Episode 211-220_ ad nthose oterh ones are not needed by me?

What is so special aboutt those other ones as its' just a waste of space which will be deleted once I have 211 to 220 and have waited for to seed theses?
"
,olivo,2008-02-20T16:13Z,"Bobdel: The reason to why they dont fit your exact need is because it wasnt made for you alone, you fuckin selfcentered bastard, they where meant for many, and you can deselect them and only download the episodes you need, if you want to

P.S ty for uploading"
