:. About.:

ToonCar is a fun and fast paced driving game 
that puts you in control of a cartoon car and driver. 
It is your task to learn how to control your vehicle, 
how to get the fastest lap times on the different tracks, 
and how to use the correct weapon at the right time! 
But bear in mind that different vehicles handle in different 
ways, and that it doesn't always pay to be in the lead for 
long periods of time!

You can play the game against computer controlled opponents, 
or for even more fun, you can play against your friends in either
split screen multiplay, and even across a LAN! However you decide 
to play ToonCar, you can be sure that the game will keep you coming
back for more and more!.

This arcade-style racing game features a variety of cartoon characters
and exotic tracks. Probably more for the younger ones!.
