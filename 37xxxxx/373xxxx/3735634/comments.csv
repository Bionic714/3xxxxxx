,Adarious,2007-07-10T00:15Z,come on people .. I wanted to know what people thought of his music...take the 2 minutes to comment please?
,dsiglin,2007-07-20T00:56Z,"I'll leave a comment about his music. It's one of the styles I love. Thank you for sharing it. I love the old time feel of the recording. Was it recorded on a phonograph? It has some crackling in it that makes me think it was but that could be achieved with a tape recorder as well. Either way, I registered on here just so I could leave some encouraging feedback. I'm sorry that your father passed away, but thank you for sharing something of who he was. I'll be listening to this for a long time."
