This is a collection of my recently deceased father's piano playing.  A handful of them are his own, but many of them you may recognize as various kinds of music that were around during his younger years.  It had been his one wish, before he was lost to his 4th run in with cancer at the age of only 60, to get himself known.  Give it a listen, let me know what you think...and if nothing else at least it may be interesting for you to listen to.

Many people seem to define his playing as "Ragtime" if that helps give an idea of what to expect.  He does not "read music" .. when he plays he plays via memory and as he goes.
