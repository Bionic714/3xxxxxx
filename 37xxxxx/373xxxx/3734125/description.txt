Synopsis: At Le Hollandais gourmet restaurant, every night is filled with opulence, decadence, and gluttony. But when the cook (Richard Bohringer), a thief (Michael Gambon), his wife (Helen Mirren) and her lover (Alan Howard) all come together, they unleash a shocking torrent of sex, food, murder, and revenge.
THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE, AND HER LOVER has been called everything from savage political satire to daring pornography, yet critics worldwide agree on one thing: In this courageous and challenging classic, writer/director Peter Greenaway has created nothing less than a cinematic feast for the senses.
