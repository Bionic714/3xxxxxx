,CostelloCostigan,2007-07-11T01:02Z,I got a question. It's done downloading and all-- but do I need anything in specific to play this? And if I do where can I download it?
,CostelloCostigan,2007-07-11T01:06Z,"Never mind. I got to it to play in RealPlayer.

And you are now my FUCKING GOD!!! I have been trying to see this for years."
