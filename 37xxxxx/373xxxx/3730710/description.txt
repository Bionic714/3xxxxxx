This is a compilation album with the Japanese singer Kyu Sakamoto,
it contains 166 songs from the beginning of his career in 1959 to the end of it in 1985. This album is not sold outside Japan and I can?t find any other downloadable version on the net, so this is maybe your only chance to get it. I hope that it works this time and that you will enjoy it.
