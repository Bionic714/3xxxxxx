...yes, the firewall was the cooperative.....

 - could you now try to reseed the ""Ue wo muite arukou~Kyu Sakamoto Monogatari | Japan 2005 | Drama/Biography ""...?

,billyAD,2008-01-22T00:35Z,"This looks like a really great download but I got about 3/4s of it and then ran out of seeders. Is there someone still seeding it? My torrent program doesn't seem to be picking them up if there is. Kalle7890 would you be a star and keep it going if you're still there? Cheers, Billy."

,appollo12,2012-01-11T09:59Z,"Wow, when I was in Japan a couple of times I was searching CD stores for any Kyu Sakamoto Cd's even in Shibuya with no luck. I thought Book Off may have had some but again no luck. This is an amazing file and Sukiyaki, his international hit is listed as ""ue wo muite arukou"" in this listing.
Died at 43 in a plane crash born in 1941 in Kawasaki, Japan...his music seems to now being global. He was the only teen singer in japan to tackle songs of Elvis and Del Shannon plus other US hits. Thankyou kalle7890 a great job. "
