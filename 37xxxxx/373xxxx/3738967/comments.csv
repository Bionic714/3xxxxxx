,daniel142005,2007-07-28T00:00Z,"Confirmed, it IS the full version, and for all you fucking noobs that say its not, maybe if you didn't install the trial previously then it would be registered, make sure you know what your talking about before talking shit... There is something you can do to completely get rid of the trial first, but with your attitude I'm not going to post it."
