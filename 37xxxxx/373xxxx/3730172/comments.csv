,INEEDASTUPIDUSERNAME,2007-07-02T14:51Z,I used the Force Start on the seeding and it started up for a few seconds then back to zero. I have it as initial seeding also.
,INEEDASTUPIDUSERNAME,2007-07-02T14:52Z,"Shit. I just found my problem. Fixed.
Sorry 'bout that."
,psychosmurf,2007-07-02T19:55Z,Most excellent!  Thanks for the great upload USERNAME.

The permissions on the PDF need to be turned off for you to be able to export the JPEGs.

I really appreciate you bringing this here,
But I'd suggest you re-seed a version that allows people to tamper with the PDF.

Because trying to read then using a PDF is kind of hard."
,W00DR0W,2007-07-02T22:43Z,"Oh, and there's a free and easy program that lets you import the JPEGs, go to ""download,com"" and look up: PDF Image Extraction Wizard

(assuming you have the permissions set to allow tampering. Personally my computer is too slow to handle zooming in and out of those things):



Thanks again USERNAME, I hope you redo some or post more (:"
