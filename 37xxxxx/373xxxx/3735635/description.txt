"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" is an outstanding film that demonstrates how greed can corrupt one's soul. Humphrey Bogart delivers one of his most memorable performances playing a scraggly down-and-outer, whose gold prospecting windfall leads only to paranoia and violence.

This is a classic movie that studies the effects of greed and human nature as three prospectors hunt for gold in the Mexican desert. Look for Director John Huston (who won a NY Film Critics and an Oscar for Best Director 1948) as a American tourist in the beginning of the film.
Also look for a young Robert Blake (remember him from the TV series Beretta)selling lottery tickets.
Walter Houston who is John's real life dad won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor 1948 for his portrayal of Howard the old time prospector.
Be sure to check out the scene around the campfire after a hard day on the trail :) 
This movie is as timely today as when it was released. Great character development. If you like classic movies and you haven't seen this one you're missing a awesome film!
