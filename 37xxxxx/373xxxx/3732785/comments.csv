,crump,2007-11-11T19:50Z,"I am working on rebuilding several server sources into one easy to use build. Unfortunately this torrent has one problem with the TerraNet Rev6 .SQL , no one has a full file.

If anyone does have the finished file, it would be a great help if you would torrent it or allow me to seed it so some of us at 99.8 can start seeding and actually see if this is a good build.

Thanks"
