OH BY THE WAY I\\\\\\\'M NOT TRYING TO YELL BUT I WANT YOUR ATTENTION!!! If you are downloading this to get the few albums that weren\\\\\\\'t in my last torrent (or the large number that weren\\\\\\\'t in my first if you just got that) PLEASE!!!! Download to the same directory and have your client set to download the whole thing and not just the ones you want. The data for those albums is the same so if you do this your client will see you have them already and start to seed the albums you do have while you download the ones you need. This will help the swarm out as well as make your downloading go MUCH MUCH FASTER as you will have more to offer peers. Thanks and ENJOY!!!
