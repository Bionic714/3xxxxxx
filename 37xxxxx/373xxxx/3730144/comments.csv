,swillynswilly,2007-07-11T06:59Z,"i downloaded it from isohunt.com, got it to work with DAX 3.30 oe-a, not very impressed. but i did get it to work "
,pspnurd,2007-07-14T16:58Z,I have this game... it is no a good game!! works on 3.40 oe-a
,kashief,2008-08-14T08:52Z,"For those of u that say this is not a good game...ur only half right...its not a good game at all...because its not a game...the title is ""Traxxpad Portable Studio"" not ""Traxxpad Music Game""... With that said, only people who know something about music production will find this most usefull... Also...i find that many people find it hard because they really cant figure out how to navigate the menus and remember where things are...it takes a few days to get everything down but u will... :D

This Is A Very Good App...i Use It Often"
