,lexus123,2008-05-13T18:39Z,"OK.
Here is the way that worked on my computer:

- First I downloaded winUHA.

- Second thing: Go to C: then open Program (Files) then make a map called ''Worms'' then another intro it called ''worms 4 mayhem'', then u open the file u just downloaded and copy all files and paste intro the new mapped u made called ''worms 4 mayhem''.

- Now all the stuff is copied and you have to click on ''_Unpack.bat'' in the map you just made.

- It will do the rest by itself (takes around 5-10 minutes).

- When it's done there are a lot more icons in the ''worms 4 mayhem'' map. Just click on ''launcher.exe''.

-See by yourself!"
,Uncoolaidman,2008-05-21T22:25Z,"Yea when I open Launcher.exe, the screen comes up, I press the play button then nothing happens. Or when I open Worms 4 Mayhem.exe I get an error message that says ""This application has failed to start because protect.dll was not found."" Help?"

,VanHelvet,2010-06-16T11:12Z,"Thanks tuki_man, this is an awesome game! Hehe

It's easy to install guys....

1. Open the ""worms_4.rar"" with WinRAR or other archiving software.
2. Right click on the ""Worms 4 Mayhem"" folder and choose ""Extract to the specified folder"", and choose where you want the game folder to be located.
3. Go to that folder, and double click on ""_Unpak.bat"". Give it five minutes, go make a sandwich or something, and when you come back it's done!
4. Start ""WORMS 4 MAYHEM.exe"" to play! Create a shortcut and change the icon if you want.
