Because Orochimaru lied to her about not attacking Konoha, Tsunade begins her onslaught against Orochimaru and Kabuto. Orochimaru has Kabuto fight, but he cannot fight in such a close space so they move to an open field. Kabut eats a food pill and begins to attack Tsunade with his medical techniques. Kabuto takes out Tsunade's arm and leg and makes it hard for her to breath. Can Tsunade win against Kabuto? Will Jiraiya, Shizune, and Naruto show up in time to save her?
