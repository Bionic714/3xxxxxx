

Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) has spent the first ten years
of his life living under the stairs in the
house of his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, who
generally dislike him. Then, one day, a giant,
named Hagrid, comes to him with an invitation to
study at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry. Harry soon discovers that there are two worlds:
one is the dreary world of the Muggles where he's grown up,
and the other is one of magic and fantasy, and it's the latter in
which he's destined to live.
