,dommels,2011-01-12T15:02Z,THX A ton finaly got it working on win 7
,007drummer,2011-02-25T20:15Z,"@dommels: wanna share with the class how you did that?

i personally was able to download it fine, install it fine. when i first tried to run it, it told me a .dll file was missing, so i downloaded it and put it in MCM2's file directory, allowing me to run it. but, after i ran it, it'd show me the ""Microsoft"" advertisement, the 2nd advertisement that I can't remember the name of, and then the MCM2 photo. After that, it would tell me that MCM2 has stopped working. In other words, it never takes me to the main menu of the game before closing itself."
,Rolly93,2011-05-11T00:11Z,"@007Drummer

Make sure you put the .dll file in the file directory before you install the game. so unistall your MCM2 place the .dll file in the folder then run the setup. if during the setup there is any errors, start again by using the info in the comment. =)"
,jmoney44,2011-05-17T09:05Z,"@007Drummer  
Im having the same problem, keeps crashing after MCM2 photo.  I uninstalled and reinstalled with the .dll file and still getting same error message.  Anyone know how to fix this?"
,pilti,2011-08-09T06:07Z,"I have windows 7 and it works for me :)

First I downloaded the missing file:
http://www.driverskit.com/dll/d3drm.dll/494.html
and put it in my Motocross Madness 2 folder.

Then I rightclicked on the program ->  options -> compatibility -> run in windows XP service pack 2..

I will seed at least 3 times :-)"
