This is madness in action. Martha Argerich's Rachmaninoff Third is the fastest and most physically exciting you'll ever hear. She's recorded live, and the balances are a little strange as a result. You can also tell that Riccardo Chailly and his orchestra are having a hell of time trying to keep up with her, while anticipating what she's about to do next--but so what? This is as close as you can come to an experience of spontaneous combustion, and survive. The Tchaikovsky is, if possible, even wilder, with quite a few missed notes. But with an artist like Argerich, you simply can't judge the performance one note at a time. So go ahead: live dangerously. --David Hurwitz
