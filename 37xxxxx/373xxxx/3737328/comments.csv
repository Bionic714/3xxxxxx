[V],Subzero!,2007-07-10T11:57Z,due to your lamness the last couple days i dont see ANY reason for this!...
[T],Knaster,2007-07-10T23:07Z,"maybe an rip of ""Cutthroats:Terror on the high seas"" perhaps. You see for some reason i and several other people cant install that game. So a rip would be very kind "
[V],Subzero!,2007-07-11T04:51Z,"noticed, but not promised, have to leech that first, and if depends on the size..."
[T],Knaster,2007-07-11T04:54Z,"ok np. The size on that game is like 600mb. 

Im just glad you took my wish in consideration keep up the good work ;)"
[V],Subzero!,2007-07-11T15:06Z,sure thing!
[V],Subzero!,2007-07-11T15:08Z,"btw... is it upon here?... or where can i grab that, that can be fixed, so what kind of error appears?... feedback please, wanna fix that!"
[T],Knaster,2007-07-11T17:27Z,"yes it's on this site
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3509291/Cutthroats

it freezes before installshield is supposed to come up when a small dosbox comes up and it is supposed to switch to the installshield but it wont go past that. It's strange cause it works for others although not all."
[T],Knaster,2007-07-11T17:28Z,it's a great game so it's kinda sad one cant install it.
[V],Subzero!,2007-07-12T02:03Z,yeah i like these pirate like games aswell... saw alot of fixes for this one on gamespot... did you tried any of them?...  but iam sure you already know there are fixes and patches... anyways i am gonna give it a try the next couple days... weÂ´ll see...
[T],Knaster,2007-07-12T02:18Z,"Ya i've tried several fixes im stumped, it seems some can get it to work and some can't sadly im one of the latter.  I've had i working a few years ago but now i cant install it. I ofcourse this had something to do with the win XP but i know several that has it working without any trouble. :sigh: "
,Stevo24,2007-07-13T08:09Z,"Thanks subzero for San Andreas! Worked perfectly and can't wait to download this! One question, how big is the game once everything is decompressed?"
[V],Subzero!,2007-07-14T03:51Z,"dont know exactly anymore, since i dont keep games on my harddisk, they get tested and after uploading, theyre removed, about scarface you can be sure its a few gigabytes.... and take  a hell of time  to install... as far as i can remeber""....enjoy"

,Anbumedic,2008-06-06T17:59Z,"@sukhy30
the voices might have been accidentally deleted by him for some of the stuff, or your sound card cannot produce the voices any.

But I'm not the expert and I'll play it to give a more definitive answer later on. (like in one hour when it finishes)

Thanks for the upload Subzero. ^_^"
