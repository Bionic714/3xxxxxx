,joannellis,2007-07-03T04:34Z,"Thanks for the feedback...I hope the quality meets your approval as well (yes?).

As far as reissues go, I think you'll have to just check through my uploads and see what they say, I'm not sure from memory which albums are the original releases and which are reissued.

Enjoy!
