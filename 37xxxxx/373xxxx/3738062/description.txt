It's hard to say all that much about this movie without giving it away.. But there are a few things I can say about it. Initially I had mixed feelings about it..but continue to watch it because it is fascinating. It's basically about a woman who is struggling with her own identity and her life and relationships with people and the world around her. It certainly passes my standards for good lesbian film noir that isn't just raunchy and raw; it isn't like pornography. It's a real movie with real characters who have real feelings. Very 3-dimensional. I can say altogether that I really enjoyed this film. I identified very much with the main character, and it left me with a sense of...reality but at the same time pondering beautiful and odd things. It's hard to explain. You'll see when you watch it. Enjoy.
