How do you use the crack file?"
,052jostor,2007-07-26T14:58Z," Install dcloner.exe.  Copy precracked exe from the Crack folder
        and place into DVD-Cloner IV\'s installed folder overwriting
        existing file.  Launch DVD-Cloner IV and use any Code and Email
        to register.  You now have a fully registered version of
        DVD-Cloner IV!"

This rocks, straight forward and no hassles.  I have been wasting DVD's on Roxie, and this pretty much works error free, and fast.

Thanks again!"
