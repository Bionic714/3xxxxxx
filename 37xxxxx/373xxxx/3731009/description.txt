Here is a dvd image that I recommend burning with DVD Decrypter (free on the net - use ISO / Write option to burn it), or use Nero, or Alcohol 120. Anything that can burn ISO image files. There is no compression here, it is 100 % quality. Episodes include: The Legend Of The Volcano Sisters, The Swamp Creature, Horsing Around, & Special Delivery. This DVD is full screen format, and the original source was NTSC DVD. It is now, region free. I found covers for the front and back as well, which are included here. Enjoy!
