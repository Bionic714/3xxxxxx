,danyboy666,2007-07-07T23:07Z,"ok..its 2 version of the game US version and euro version done with  nero .. bootable , include warzone server... everything is written in the NFO file you can mount the gaem to virtual drive(daemontool better) or burn it to cd 700mb.. if you install euro version copy noC crack in risk II folder . US version doesnt need noCD crack .. DO NOT COPY EUOR VERSION noCD CRACK IN FOLDER IF YOU INSTALLED US VERSION : THE GAME WONT WORK.. "
,danyboy666,2007-07-07T23:19Z,i made a mistake in NFO file .. it says nocD carck for both version but i took out the 1 for US since you dont need it to play.. as long as you have cd in tray the game will work

,beliluk,2008-04-07T11:32Z,"IT`S NOT WORKING!!!
After replacing crack file to microprose folder, it still gives me error message.
Instead of pointing out differences between US and Euro version, maybe you should give us dummy guide, step-by-step how ti install it, `cause it has 100 folders in it. "

,mr samsung,2008-04-10T19:20Z,"OOOOOOOOOPS

a little to fast b4 US works too....

but DO NOT install it in the same folder as euro version.....

Also if you mount it  be sure to use the same drive as you did when you installed it....

then it works like a charm

and a no cd patch to US does NOT exist my frind  

nice job danyboy66

looking forward to try the us version  online
