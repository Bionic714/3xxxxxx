                                 Install Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
install risk II either us OR euro version ; but US version is most recommended 
if you wanna host onlines games on warzone + most users on warzone have US 
version; but if even if you have euro version you'll be able to join any game 
you want; it all depends on wich version the host have; if US version , 
everybody in that room will have US version, same for euro version.

-----------------> 2 major diferences between the 2 versions are noticable
            - 1st. (CARDS) With euro version you have no trades on fly; wich 
means if you kill someone and you have more than 5 cards you have to sit and  
wait on your next turn to exchange them , US version let you trade cards right 
away before you turn ends.
            - 2nd. (DICES) Defenders dices in euro and US version are different:
         Euro version -> when defender has 2 troops left will defend with 1 dice,
         U.S. version -> When defender has 2 troops left will defend with 2 dices

P.S. : You'll probably need to install indeo codec included in the folder to run U.S. version cinematics

Run update
Install warzone
Install Risk II execute(this will install correct version of risk to play on warzone)

-----------------> BE SURE TO OPEN ALL NECESSARY PORTS IF YOU HAVE ROUTER <-----------------------

---> either by port forwarding or demilitarize zone (DMZ) { This opens all port for you ip }

execute warzone; it wil do a update, restart warzone, choose nick and password,choose a room to play or open a room if you wanna host; 
better test if you can launch the game properly first time you come to warzone, 
you need at least 3 persons to launch to map, try a couple turn to see if all ok and the game doesnt freeze up 
(it can happen sometimes), 

HAPPY GAMING!!

P.S. : No quiters allowed; quiters will be blacklisted and you wont be able to join any games in the lobbie.
