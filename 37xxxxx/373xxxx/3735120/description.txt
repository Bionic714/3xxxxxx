Vista Transformation Pack 6.0 - Final
Desktop EnhancementsVista Transformation Pack will give to your Windows XP system the new and cool look of Microsoft's future operating system: Windows Vista. The pack changes most of the system icons, skins and toolbars and also adds new enhancements to your desktop such as a dock bar or a different system tray clock. It is free and does a great job of giving machine a look similar to Vista.

It does have uninstallation options in case you decide you want to get rid of it, so there really isn창??t anything to lose. However, when you install the software it has to overwrite some system files (it modifies things like the boot screen) so Windows will prompt you stating that your system files have been changed. It will ask whether you want to change them back or leave them, so just leave them if you want the system to function properly.

Merry Christmas! Now the waiting is over. This release has successfully archived full setup integration support (no more experimental) and add covering on x64 partial support (experimental). Plus, I added many new 3rd-party applications to make your system looks more like Vista such as Styler, Sidebar, Taskbar thumbnail preview, Start orb fix for msstyles, etc. and update many new resources for system files. It창??s definitely the best release that I ever made!

"Has been updated proper version that fixes Styler창??s installation problem and corrects Vista Live Messenger skin창??s credit. If you wish to install Styler for Vista toolbar, please re-download again and install the proper version."
