Aerosoft Faro 2005 (RIP)
(Current version is v3.0, but I'm not sure which version this is)

Aeroporto de Faro, the gateway to the Algarve, a well known touristic region of Portugal has recently been upgraded and was one of the last touristic airports that was not done in good detail for FS2004. Part of the upcoming LTU project this airport is now available online. A fine destination, less then 3 hours from all Western European centres. The scenery is detailed and done with care. Colors and the shape of details are accurate. Although the level of detail is high, you will find framerates to be excellent. 

 Features:
- The whole terminal and apron layout based on accurate data
- Fully compatible with AI Traffic
- Dynamic scenery
- Accurate day and night textures 
- Static aircrafts if you prefer to run without AI Traffic
- Taxiways, runways and parking positions
- Whole island covered with High Definition mesh, landclass and roads.
