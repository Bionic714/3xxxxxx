Average Customer Review: (five stars)
a FANTASTIC value for a TREASURE TROVE of historic country music!, May 1, 2007 
By Mister Charlie (Los Angeles, CA)
One could argue with the inclusion or exclusion of certain songs or artists, 
but with this boxed set you get 20 CDS, 400 SONGS of mostly fantastic country & 
western (& a dash of bluegrass and "cowboy", and there's western swing and honky 
tonk, etc.) music from the late 1920s to the early 1950s.

From Jimmie Rodgers to Hank Williams, from Bob Wills to Tennessee Ernie Ford, 
from Gene Autry to Flatt & Scruggs, and on and on, this set is a superb way to jump-
start your classic country collection. If you're already a fan of this music and 
have cds by many of the artists contained herein, you'll probably find some songs 
repeated from your current collection, but you'll also find a swath of songs by more 
obscure artists than those mentioned here... 
I certainly hadn't heard of Keith Loyd, Bill Strength or Andy Schroder. 
The mastering/recording quality is generally pretty good.
Thanks go to this German record label for offering up this great old American music 
so affordably.
