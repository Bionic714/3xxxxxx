Big Dave meets Saddam Hussein then has to deal with the Royal Family. 1993 2000AD Summer Offensive.

From Wikipedia:

Big Dave is an infamous character created and written by Mark Millar and Grant Morrison, with artwork by Steve Parkhouse, for 2000 AD. The character was created for The Summer Offensive, an experiment in which the magazine was handed over to Millar, Morrison and John Smith for eight weeks.

Big Dave first appeared in prog 842 in his first story which featured Saddam Hussein trying to take over the world and turn everyone into \"poofs\" with the aid of some scary aliens. Big Dave, \"the hardest man in Manchester\", manages to stop Saddam\'s plan with the help of Terry Waite.

If this story was controversial then the next story surpassed it. It featured the British Royal Family as robots plus Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson as a pair of horny drunks. The story ends with Dave in bed with both royals.

Both Morrison and Millar appeared happy with such controversy but the character did split 2000 AD fans\' opinion down the middle, with some praising it as the best series the comic had ever run, while others thought it was nothing more than puerile rubbish.
