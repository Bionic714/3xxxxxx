,Danlars,2007-07-16T18:00Z,"Funkar perfekt!
Inget krångel att installera, kom bara ihåg att INTE starta om datorn innan ni patchar...!"
,qca,2007-07-19T22:39Z,"I have installed the patch, but when i restart my pc and updated nod 32 it comes a message ""upgrade to full version""? isn't this going to be the full version when we instal the patch?"
,qca,2007-07-20T16:52Z,"maby its just me who have done something wrong, but ""aakiaa"" and ""Danlars"" says that it works. can you try to download it and give me some information on how to instal this? (i have done it many times before, but on older versions)  "

,Stardaemon,2007-08-08T00:20Z,"@suckdex...

This only contains a patch. It does not contain Nod32 Fix or anyother program you have to install, except for Nod32, ofc;)"

No password.
""skip this step"" ;)"
,Draconis.Pectus,2007-08-10T06:30Z,"Works in Vista Ultimate x64. 

Shows as ""Trial Version"" in NOD32 System information menu, but the ""Upgrade"" button is no longer showing.

The ""days left"" show as 16715331. 

No problems with getting updates. 

Thanks PeRRRa!"
,Draconis.Pectus,2007-08-10T18:14Z,"Hmmm....I have to revise my previous post.

I don't know what went wrong, but this worked for a day. When I rebooted, it went back to ""trial mode"" with 30 days left. 

I tried the NOD32.Fix.v2.1.exe from another torrent and that seems to work."
,RLenory,2007-12-06T13:02Z,"What happendsafter i Patchs? becuse when i patching in the Install dir, it happens nothing and when i start nod32 i says i got a old version how do i update?

Vad händer efter att jag har pathchat? ajg ser inga ändringar? och sen när jag starta nod32 så står detatt det är en gammal version, hur uppdatera jag ?"
,dimepÃ¥se,2008-03-31T23:18Z,"Wonderful!

After downloading a bunch of shitty torrents I was happy when this one worked out! And it works really well, no problems installing.

Get this one."
