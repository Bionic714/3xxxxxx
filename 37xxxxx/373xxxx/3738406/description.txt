                       Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Human Instinct" is the story of how instincts have made us humans into the 
uniquely successful species that we are, despite us not always being aware of 
them.

Professor Lord Robert Winston was born in 1940 and named Robert Maurice 
Winston. He graduated at London University in 1964 and held junior posts at 
the London Hospital from that time. In 1970 he joined the Hammersmith Hospital 
as a Registrar and became involved in research and development in 
gynaecological microsurgery. 

He is well known today to audiences throughout the world for his several BBC 
television series, which include The Human Body, Secret Life of Twins and 
Superhuman, and through which he has shown a great capacity for communicating 
often complex science to a wide public audience. He is Professor of Fertility 
Studies at Imperial College School of Medicine, London University, and is 
world-renowned as a fertility expert. He also heads the Department of 
Reproductive Medicine at the Hammersmith Hospital in London.

In Human Instints Professor Robert Winston provides a unique insight into what 
it is that makes us human. And it is the story of our extraordinary instincts 
and why we behave the way we do and what other animals reveal about our most 
basic drives. With intriguing experiments and secret filming he uncovers the 
surprising science of sex. And helps us understand why one human being could 
lay down their life for another. In exploring survival, sex, competition and 
self-sacrifice, Professor Winston takes viewers on a journey of discovery into 
human behaviour, to look at ourselves in an entirely new way. 
He believes the series is not science for scientists - it is about trying to 
translate complex ideas into something easily accessible for all. He thinks 
the whole area of evolutionary psychology has been largely overlooked but 
thinks it's fascinating. According to Winston we all carry a prehistoric 
baggage around with us and don't have full control over it.

Part 4:

A 200,000 year old jawbone tells the story of an elderly woman who was kept alive thanks to the kindness of her companions. From this first known example of human compassion to modern day heroes, the final programme in the Human Instinct series explores the most complex of instincts. The instinct to put others first.

Blood Ties
The mother?s drive to protect her children is the most powerful heroic instinct we know. Having children is a way of ensuring our genes are passed on to the next generation. Humans usually have just one child at a time, so they are prepared to do virtually anything to ensure their children are safe. But this protective instinct also expands to the rest of our family. And the more genes we share, the more likely we are to put ourselves out for someone.

Fast Friends
But unlike many animals, humans are also willing to risk everything for people who aren?t related to them. Al Rascon received the medal of honour for his actions in the Vietnam war. He ran into a hail of bullets, risking death, to rescue his injured friend. How has this self-sacrificing instinct evolved?

Natural Born Heroes
None of us would hesitate to help someone who has had a bad fall. And it?s this same instinctive reaction which often leads to feats of great heroism. We all feel empathy when we see someone else in trouble, and at the University of Ferrara Luciano Fadiga may have found the reason why. Mirror neurones in our brains may help us mimic the actions and emotions of others.

Vampire bats and humans are amongst a handful of animals that display altruistic behaviour. We intuitively pick up others? emotions from the expressions on their faces and our instincts for language mean we can explain ourselves in ways no other animals can. But we are even more than the sum of our instincts. As human beings we learn, we reason and we choose. In the terrible disaster at the World Trade Center on September 11th, 2001 two men found they too had the drive to be heroes. Mike Benfante and John Cerqueira helped carry wheelchair bound Tina Hansen to safety. In the midst of the chaos, John and Mike were spurred on by the instincts we all share to help others. But their extraordinary heroism also reveals a strength of character that instinct alone cannot explain.
