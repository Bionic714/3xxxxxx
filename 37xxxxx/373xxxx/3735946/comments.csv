,Miger97,2007-10-10T20:36Z,"Installed great on HTC 7500 with WM6, but after all, do I need to keep all those copied files on my SD?
It takes up almost 1GB. Can I delete some ?"
,schmitey2,2007-10-22T08:52Z,"Ok.  I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out the UNSUPPORTED mess that prettypierre created for all of us.  I'm here to say that IT ALL WORKS (at least on my Dell x50v running WM6)!  Here is a list of problems I've overcome...

For starters you don't have to copy half of this crap to your actual memory card.  And I cannot stress this enough DO NOT COPY FILES INTO THE FOLDER ""COPY_TO_SD_CARD!""  This is why most of you can't get it to find a map.  Copy the following list of folders DIRECTLY to your memcard:  2577, voices, crack, and lastly USA and Canada 675_1409.  Another important step here that took me quite a bit of searching to figure out...  Copying files from the .ISO instantly makes them read only.  You will either have to copy the files off of the .ISO onto your computer and remove the read only properties or you may be able to do it from the device.  If you don't do so YOU WON""T BE ABLE TO SAVE YOUR ROUTE, HOME, OR FAVORITES!

After copying over, remove your memcard and reinsert it.  It may autoinstall and it may not.  If you get annoyed by it autoinstalling DO NOT remove the memcard or else it may damage windows mobile and keep you from installing future programs (as I found out the hard way!).  If it DOES NOT AUTOINSTALL then go into folder 2577 and manually run the ttn.cab program.  From here you have two options to actually crack it.  The quickest but more challenging way is to go into the ""crack"" folder and copy ""tomtom navigator.exe"" go into your device files and find ""program files\navigator\"" you should then see a pre-existing tomtom navigator.exe in that folder.  Paste your copied cracked .exe into that folder and tell it to overwrite.

THE EASIER ALTERNATIVE TO CRACK THE PROGRAM is to run the ""USA_and_CANADA v..."" file located in the ""CRACK"" folder on your COMPUTER.  It will open up a crude but effective command line program.  Open up your uncracked version of tomtom 6 on your device and hit manual activation.  Type in your device id that it gives you into the command line program on your compy and it will spit out an activation code you then input into the device.  I inserted all spaces and capitalized, but I'm not sure if its necessary.  Either way you choose to unlock it will work.  I should mention that if you use the activation code method you can access the TomTom PLUS services, the other method will actually DISABLE TomTom and you'll have to recopy the maps and reinstall (which is time consuming and unnecessary)!

At this point go into preferences within tomtom 6 and delete all the extra voices you don't need.  They do take a fair amount of space.  You can also delete your ""CRACK"" and ""2577"" folder from your card if you're really trying to save space.  I, however, prefer to keep them there so I can reinstall easily.

There you go.  You're welcome!  And all complaints go to prettypierre and NOT ME as I used a fake email."
,schmitey2,2007-10-22T08:58Z,"Forgot to mention, I believe you have to plug the ""voice"" folder into ""program files\navigator\"" in order for tomtom to see them.  But on second look I might be lying and it appears its using my files on the memcard...  I don't know and don't really care cuz it works as is for me.

I should probably also mention I'm using a CompactFlash card and NOT an SD.  It doesn't matter where the files are located as TomTom seeks out all memory when it searches for the map."
,schmitey2,2007-10-22T09:09Z,"Also...  Depending on your version of windows mobile syncing a bluetooth GPS device can be a real pain in the ass!  Open up TomTom and then minimize the program (you may have to bind a button to say ""file explorer"" or something to kick you out temporarily).  With tomtom (or any program that uses GPS) open and running sync your device by going into the connections setting and then bluetooth.  Some devices require a pairing code which is DEVICE DEPENDENT but most are ""0000"".  

Once windows mobile is paired go back into tomtom 6 and hit the signal bar on the lower right.  It should now show a diff. screen with version 6.0 in the lower right.  This time his the signal bar in the upper right and hit ""configure"".  Scroll over and select ""other bluetooth device""  My GPS at least uses com 8 I believe.  You'll have to play around with it, but in most cases the com port you need will not be listed in TomTom until your simultaneously pair the GPS with windows mobile.  There has to be a better way I know, but that's how it works."

""I'm waiting for the solution by 'Drifter'. Meanwhile I have disabled the ""Build In Storage"". In all those years I've never used the BIS so I won't miss it...

Get Total Commander:

    * Go to \\\registry\HKLM\System\StorageManager\AutoLoad\PS M
    * Open the key ""Dll"" by ""double-tapping"" the file
    * Change its 'String value' to ""PSMFSD.dll.xxx"" and press OK

Soft reset your device and the BIS has 'disappeared'. Now start TomTom and everything works as it should.

Select your GPS receiver/ 
GPS baud rate = 57600 (saw this on MODACO)/
GPS is connected to: Com 4.

The reason you might not get it working is cos you?re inside a large building. I live under a block of flats and I can only pick up ONE satellite half of the time. TomTom was meant to be used outside. If it keeps saying NO VALID GPS SIGNAL like it did on my Vario III simply go out on the street for 30 secs and it should work.

OMG? TomTom on my mobile phone!!!

,Testaroscia,2008-02-23T02:28Z,"Help is at hand for all of you who like me just COULD NOT find a solution to the ""No Maps Found"" problem

I followed schmitey2's insx but i need to add the following. If you have previously installed the program and reached a standstill the uninstall the program and delete the TomTom directory from the Program Files directory. Reinstall everything per his instructions BUT AFTER the install, AND BEFORE you start the program
Disable Bluetooth Explorer from Settings -> Connections -> Bluetooth -> Bluetooth FTP

It causes TomTom to think that the bluetooth folder is your storage card and tries to load map from there. Disabling it should do the trick.

It work a charm after that and i finally got to the ""Activate"" screen and continued using schmitey's instructions.

My phone is HTC TnTY/AT&T Tilt"
,dbunnell2,2008-02-28T01:55Z,"For those of you that are getting the ""no maps found"" error.  I have a lengthy but useful solution.  I installed tomtom using the ttn cab or ttn03, whichever you need by copying it onto the sdcard and running it.  Then copy the map folder onto the sdcard.  You don't need all of the other things in the torrent. The map may initially work, but when you do a soft reset it loses track of where the map is.  I solved this by installing TomTom home off the web and using it to copy the map back onto the computer.  Then delete the map folder off of the sdcard.  Use TomTom home to install it back onto the sdcard.  It is at this time you will need to use the crack program to get your activation code.  Your device id can be found under TomTom Home in Help:Configuration Info...  This takes a looong time, but it does work and works well.

Apparently this will generate the needed folder structure and configuration files so TomTom doesn't lose track of the map.  The best way to add the voices is to download the free ones from the TomTom website.  I've done this under WM2003 and WM5 with success.

Good Luck!!"
,smhx,2008-02-28T23:42Z,"an easier way around the soft reset problem (on my vario3/tytn2) is to take out the sd card and soft reset again

when its back in wm6, put the sd card back in (if you set msg attachments to save to the sd card, it will create a folder called 'storage card' which you need to delete first or else it calls the sd card 'storage card2') and voila, itll work again without having to play with tom tom home"

You don?t need ?voices? folder in ?My Device/program files/navigator? like schmitey2 wasn?t sure about.  It makes its own ?My Device/program files/navigator/voices? folder with a ?collected? file.  Not sure what that is?maybe it?s the one that you select since it needs to be fast I/O from device and not slow I/O from SD card???  Anyway, just leave all the folders on the root path of SD card and follow schmitey2 install instructions."
,redbandana,2008-03-25T00:07Z,"The directions don't seem to work. However, there is another way to get this working. 

First, unzip files onto desktop.
2nd, move the cab file onto ""my documents"" on your phone
3rd, run cab file then move US & Canada maps to the sd card. Place SD card back into phone. 
4th, run TomTom Home on your computer. This does not need to run on your phone because everytime u sync it will update. 
5th, TomTom home will tell you to select a voice for your device. I choose Bonny. 
6th, copy the \""tomtom navigator\"" file from the crack folder of the SD
card and replace it with the one in the root installation of your tomtom software which is located in
\""My device->program files->navigator\
7th, open tomtom on ur phone, at the set up screen select ""other device"" if you have gps capabilities on your phone and set the baud rate to maximum. 
8th, find kaisertweak reg somewhere and enable the gps setting on it. AT&T has this disabled because they want you to use their data plan.
9th, Go outside and reopen tomtom on your device. Works like a charm.

tomtom installation
1. copy folders 2577, USA and Canada, and voices to root of storage card (not in
to a folder)
2. run ttn2003.cab on mobile device
3. after installation and before running program, cut and paste voices folder to 
program files/navigator/
4. run tomtom, follow prompts, choose manual activation. it will give you an code
5. run USA and Canada v.675... from crack folder on pc. 
6. type code given from step 4 into the dos prompt crack program (include caps and the 
space)
7. crack program will give you an activation number.
8. use activation number on mobile device to activate.

also for those running wm6.1:
phone setup
1. press phone (get to the dial keypad)
2. menu>options>services tab>location setting, then click get settings...
3. switch to location on
also
1. start>settings>system tab, then click external gps
2. gps program port: COM4
3. under hardware tab, gps harware port: (none), baud rate: 4800
4. under access tab, check ""manage gps automatically""

also
tomtom won't activate the gps abilities in some phones (it didn't in mine), so:
1. download astrolauncher (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=364199)
2. install on mobile
3. run astrolauncher (iGuidance Launcher) right before starting tomtom

settings for tomtom:
1. main menu>change preferences>arrow>arrow>show GPS status>configure
2. select ""other nmea gps receiver""
3. gps baud rate: 4800, click done
4. click (touchscreen) COM4

,beanmchne,2008-07-27T02:28Z,"schmitey2's instructions worked perfectly for me and my mogul ppc-6800.  I just put all files on storage card, and not in any folder.  only way i've figured out to get the gps working, is to first activate gps with google maps or gpstoday, then switch back to tomtom and it's good to go.  Gotta say this is an awesome download, so thanks to everyone for helping people like me who get a lil confused sometimes  :)"
,Idolsys,2008-08-24T01:30Z,"I give. I have tried all variations, reinstalls and combining this and other torrents yet I still cannot get anything but the Guam map to show. Placing maps on the SD and soft resets do nothing and from within the app selecting change maps shows only Guam."

I have install everything in the SD card, and i had the same problem of ""no map found"", plus there is no option for me to choose operate manually.  

when i try to uninstall the program from my PDA, it doesnt allow.  

I see the solution from many experts here said , i can install TOMTOM home,  is it through PC? or should directly though PDA?  I try both.  but there is "" its not a valid PDA program ""..  experts.. what i can do? pls kindly advice, thanks"

Edit ok, I got it to install but I live everyone have this no maps found, and I get the same thing in TomTom Home"
,Karlzbad,2008-09-30T01:39Z,"Em that is, when I copy the maps anywhere on my computer, tom tom home cant see them either, and I can't find anything about the file structure of the maps."
,MadisonMan39,2008-11-06T03:32Z,"Thanks to prettypierre and to schmitey2.  Schmitey's instructions worked for me, but then I had a strange problem.  If the battery ran out and I had to charge, or if I had to reboot, when my Kaiser came back on the Tomtom screen came up and would not get passed the opening screen.  It also prevented activesync from working.  Here is what I did:  I popped out the storage card and manually removed tomtom.  I then deleted the crack and 2577 folders and the did a soft reboot.  I was then able to use activesync again.  I then copied both the 2577 and crack folders again.  Then, I popped the card out and in which started the reinstall.  Once I had the program up and running, I exited out.  Then--here's the key-- I deleted the autorun/autostart that was in either of the two folders.  Now the Kaiser works just fine.  The only thing it did is that Tomtom no longer starts automatically upon turning on the phone, which is what it originally did.  That is fine with me, because I want to start it manually so as not to lose so much battery power from the gps running.  One other tip:  get a copy of gps test, which is free and run it before you run tomtom.  It actually speeds things up, though I cannot explain why.  You can do a web search for gps test or find a link on xda developers.  Good luck."
,yadayadaya,2008-12-02T15:29Z,"If you are getting ""no maps found"" it's because the USA and Canada 675_1409 folder must be in the ROOT of your SD card.  Not in any folder.  

That is how the direction are setup, but who in their right mind wants all that crap in your root?  Not to mention most of it isn't need to install on PPC anyways as part of it is for the desktop.  The only folder required to be in the root is the maps.  You can run the installation from anywhere.  Also, install TomTom Home on your PC and you can download voice updates and then copy them to your phone."
,jpmi23,2008-12-07T20:57Z,Has any one tested this on a Moto Q? I've got a Q9c (running WM6.1) and it's hard to find apps that actually work porperly on it. Thanks in advance.
,pgguy007,2009-01-21T03:55Z,"This might help a few people....I used this successfully with HTC Touch Pro running WM6.1.
When ActiveSync is running, my maps dissapear and TomTomHome does not show content on the phone.  Click the ""active running programs"" icon at the top right of the screen and turn off ActiveSync.  Everything should show up fine now.
Thanx for the D/L!
Oh, and definitely try the link for the Mr.T voices posted in the comments....it comes with 5 voices which are all hilarious....well worth the D/L. hehe"
