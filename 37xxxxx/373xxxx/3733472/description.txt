Most complete pro-shot version of a Rumours show. Very good version of Gold Dust Woman. 
Put together from a broadcasts and outtakes.

Notes from original uploader:
\"Not the entire Show but as Much as I could find on dvd (Most of It). I believe this is the most Complete collection of songs from this Great show and in correct order of the concert according to the audience tape \"stages\" of the same show ! There is No menu but there are Chapter breaks at the beginning of each song. Taken from Japanese TV , Outtake Clips and the Japan documentary DVDs. This is in the Best Quality I could find and is Quite good , overall 8 outa 10 Very Enjoyable !\"
