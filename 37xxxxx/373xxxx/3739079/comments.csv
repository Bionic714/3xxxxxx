If you like it, you could also concider buying the album ;)

Thank you"
,bmnrocks,2007-07-17T18:06Z,Can you put this up in FLAC
,Someotherdude,2007-07-18T20:39Z,"sorry, I'm never upload flac.
If highest mp3 quality isn't enough, then go buy the cd or find it somewhere else...

Flac is too big, and too would be too much pressure on my network, as I'm sure you don't want to spend days downloading."
,Superperforator,2007-09-09T22:04Z,"Downloaded and seeding at the moment.
Album is pretty good and I'll buy it next week."
,Bomis_,2007-10-09T18:07Z,"hello,
i really want an album from the discography and wonder if you can seed that one please.
if you dont have it left i would be happy if you can put out ""the empire strikes first"" as a torrent."

I have been bummed, you see..I had all of the old stuff on vinyl and it got lost in a move along with my Crass, GBH, MDC, DK etc.. But this is an awesome start to rebuilding my od collection! Thanks and PEACE! "
