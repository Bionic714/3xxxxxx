,msken,2007-07-10T23:42Z,Any idea whats taking so long for a good copy to come out? Its killing me to get my hands on this movie. I've seen this twice in the theaters and can never hear all the dialog because people are so ignorant when it comes to shutting the fuck up when you are at a theater. That and the movie is shot so quick its hard to catch a lot of the action.

Post when someone's watched it to confirm instead of whining before it's done.. It's real"
