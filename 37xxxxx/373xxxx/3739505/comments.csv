,hacaro,2007-07-18T22:45Z,"Thank you for the torrent.However I am not able to add the audio files to NERO.It says""The following files may not reside in the VTS directory of a DVD video compilation.""Then it names all the audio files.Anyone have any suggestions?Thanks."
,shinehigh,2008-04-22T01:38Z,"Thanks man, I appreciate it. But I am having the same problem as hacaro...How do I burn the Audio files? I do use Nero, and tried like you said, but no such luck. Anybody got any ideas? Thanks for the movie though man!

FOR THOSE WHO ARE HAVING TROUBLE BURNING THE DVD.

You only need to drag the VIDEO_TS folder into Nero(or whichever program you are using to burn).The resulting disc will still have sound.Even though DVD's seem to be split into VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS folders you will always only ever need to burn the VIDEO_TS.

The audio folder should and can be burned to a different disc.It is the audio of the two 'Dairy' shows from Tupelo that Elvis did that day,sounding like it was recorded from the audience (and included years ago on the 'Silver' box set)

I hope this helps all you who are having problems. 

Thanks again,Miguel"
