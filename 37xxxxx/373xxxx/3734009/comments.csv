I figured it might need a No-CD Crack but after some research and figuring out what the poor translations from babelfish actually meant, it simply refers to a file which is on the original CD. I don't know who bothered to upload this torrent, but it took over two weeks to download this and Pt. II, and its simply a copy of an installed directory of the game instead of an ISO. Worthless torrents and I won't be sharing this anymore. Waste of time!"
,Refia,2007-09-11T02:23Z,"Obviously it's not an ISO, also it's not my fault no one else is seeding. Just looking at the file gives away that it's not an iso. If it were, I would have just had the ISO by itself! The game works perfectly, as I'm playing it right now. Don't listen to this fucktard. Fucking n00bs..."
,Refia,2007-09-12T05:25Z,"Also, try renaming the folder from the name in Chinese into English because this is the actual problem you're experiencing. Learn to actually put some effort into running the program before you throw a hissy fit that it won't work because it's not an .iso. OH SHIT MY FOOD ISN'T AN ISO FILE I CAN'T EAT IT.

Shitty logic, etc etc."
,daddychainmail,2008-08-24T22:14Z,"Hey, I got the download; you're right, you've just got to change the folder into english instead of the gobbledeegook chinese title. But, how the hell can I make it english subtitles? Ya got any ideas?"

I'm so close ;_;"
