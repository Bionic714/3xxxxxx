Princess maker is a series where you are a father raising up a ten year-old daughter to the age of eighteen. You determine her schedule, where she works, what clothes she wears, what she eats, what education she will get, and her overall status as a townsperson. This is the fourth game in the series in Chinese.

NOTE: If you use WinRAR to open this it might ask you for part 2. I will upload that in a separate torrent.

NOTE 2: On the first screen you see after you install the game and click \\\"start new game\\\" (the first option on the title screen) You will have to enter in your daughter\\\'s and your name, respectively. This can only be done with Chinese or Japanese characters, so be aware of that.

Enjoy :)
