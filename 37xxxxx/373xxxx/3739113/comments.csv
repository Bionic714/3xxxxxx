,titestef,2007-08-04T05:11Z,"hum... It doesn't to be the same cut than US/UK/FRENCH versions (and others countries). Censored in Spain  (95mins)? not really, Spain version is just a different cut, less violent than french version for example (go to check out : allocine.fr  , there are some diffents extracts from CAPTIVITY for its french theatrical release in august). UK and US versions are 85minutes versions... but have alternate shots of blood (a corpse in the bathroom for example). "

Definitely not the same versions!!!
SPAIN/RUSSIAN VERSION : FIRST CUT
US / UK / OTHERS : SECOND CUT (AFTERDARK FILMS/LIONS GATE VERSION), with alternate edit, new scenes, more shots of torture and gore, deleted sequences and alternate ending.

,titestef,2007-08-04T06:01Z,"""deleted sequences"", I mean some scenes from the first cut that don't appear in the second cut (the scenes with the two cops for example)."
