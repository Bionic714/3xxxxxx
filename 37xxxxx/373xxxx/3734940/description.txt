What is ShapeChangerÂ®? â??
ShapeChanger is a tool to help you explore the powers of your mind. You decide on a possibility
and hold it in mind while the image unfolds on your computer display. The outcome may be
responsive to your feelings and intentions. When it is, you will know it by the results you get.
ShapeChanger opens a door to measuring the effect of mind on matter. You can experience
ShapeChanger in the spirit of play, like a game, or as a vehicle to explore abilities you may not
have realized that you possess.
Playing ShapeChanger is a personal experience that helps you learn to focus your will and
intentions on desired outcomes and make them happen.
Hereâ??s What Happens â??
You choose two images from a collection, and pick one to be your preferred target. ShapeChanger
mixes them on the display, and then randomly shifts pixels from one to the other.
The two scenes compete for pixels, and which one wins is determined by a random process which
you influence to favor your target using your mind alone. According to the laws of chance, you
can expect to get the picture you want about half of the time. Your goal is to exceed that rate and
make your desired picture appear as rapidly as possible.
Play options include personal play where you compete against chance, and competitive or
supportive two-person modes. Groups can also work together to achieve their chosen
ShapeChanger goal or compete with each other.
We canâ??t promise that you will become a master manipulator of your world, but we believe that
playing with ShapeChanger will give you practice in deciding what you want and focusing your
intentions and mental images to get it. We canâ??t promise an easy win in Lotto or a casino (the
odds are too stacked against you), but we believe that holding positive intentions can give you an
edge. Playing ShapeChanger will sharpen that edge, because it is designed to help you learn how
to manifest your intentions.
For a major challenge to your conceptions of space-time, ShapeChanger allows you to play from
remote locations and times. ShapeChanger can also be set to run as a continuous sequence
resulting in scores that may be affected by whatâ??s going on in its environment.
The purpose is for you to learn and have fun playing and beating chance, while practicing
manifesting your intentions on a computer!
