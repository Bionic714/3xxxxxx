Install notes :  Although I ideally do not like loaders,this works for me, do exactly as it says bellow and make sure the auto update option in settings is unchecked and ideally block with a real Firewall not XP one.


1) Rename Alcohol.exe on _Alcohol.exe in install directory of Alcohol
2) copy this Alcohol.exe in install directory of Alcohol
3) start register.reg
4) start Alcohol.exe in install directory of Alcohol !!

Do not relink Alcohol.exe !!!


I think it means do not run Alcohol with the orignal .exe or shortcut as it could fial to work, you can make a shortcut to the file you relaced it with and edit it so it does not say "shortcut" and "exe" on your neat desktop, but I have ignored this and ran it both ways and its not dead yet.
