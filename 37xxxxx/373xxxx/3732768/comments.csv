,McPorra,2007-07-05T00:09Z,"Thanks for another great upload 4X-AXG. I wonder if this crack also applies to the Cheyenne installer and if so, could anyone upload it? TIA"
,Baster23,2007-07-05T01:21Z,"Hi All,
Have anyone the Update for the FS2004 Do-27 1.20 Update ??
THX !!"
,Beeeye,2007-07-05T02:29Z,@ McPorra - It's definately worth a try using the crack on other aerosoft installs as they appear to be the same.
,01T,2007-07-05T08:52Z,What about UT? anyone know something about the new wrapper?
,Mr Silver,2007-07-05T09:41Z,"Thanks 4X, always with the best stuff.

..although why you get the idiot fringe following you defeats me! Did you do something bad to your parents???

And this elievano pillock, sonny you really don't understand the plot do you?!"
,subicbay,2007-07-05T15:29Z,"@elievano, You say: ""get the real thing not stolen at fs2004.info"".

Pirates call other pirates thieves
From which planet are you?
Or, perhaps, naively?

Thanks 4X"
,McPorra,2007-07-05T17:49Z,"Beeeye: Thanx for you repply. As we all pirates know, original installers are much better than rips, so if 4X will excuse me, I'd like to request those who have addons from Aerosoft, specially airplanes, like the excellent Cheyenne, pls post them here. TIA.

,TehNetherlands,2007-11-11T18:20Z,"The crack works, it installs, but after about 30 minutes the airplane suffers from several failures. They remain after restarting, so don't waste your time downloading this file."
,TehNetherlands,2007-12-07T23:13Z,Ignore my previous comment. I never expected this level of realism ;)

,blimeygbg,2008-03-03T23:41Z,"hoteldebotel11

How did you solve the installation? I can't seem to find the folder either. And I'm using swedish windows. 

And I would guess the reason you cannot control it is because you need to use differential breaks (F11 and F12). But that's just a guess. 

Help with installation would be much appreciated."
,frank4567,2008-03-07T17:30Z,"Pls seed im stuck at 12.3% , Ill seed after THX"

unless you advise otherwise, but first I need a little seeding help from your loyal followers.

Thanks soo much for the great upload :)> 

BTW, can anyone suggest where I can purchase some used HW (peddles, etc..) to play these little gems more efficently?"
,PTI317,2008-06-25T16:30Z,keep it seedin'! ;-D
,gammie,2009-01-31T18:06Z,"Hello stressed friends. This DO27 is very complicate to handle. It's almost 'over-realistic'. Flying itself is beautiful, however.
But I can tell some tipps here so that handling of DO27 becomes much easier!

1. Install - Easy to do. 
Just click the exe for installing, if windows appears, click on. Next window is 'welcome' screen. HERE you need to copy the cracked ascrypt.dll into the folder inside your temp-folder (like windows\temp or similar). You have to look inside your temp folder. There are one or two new folders named with digits and letters. You click inside these folders for to locate the ori-ascrypt.dll. Now you overwrite this dll by copy over the cracked one. Fine. 
Now you go on with install by clicking on the welcome screen menu. Next there is a field for email and others. You leave all that FREE and simply click ok. Now it installs completely. Fine.

2. To start and fly this plane 
is rather hard and complicated because this DO27 is hyper realistic. You need to open some menues via shift-2, shift-3 and on up to shift-6 and shift-8. With shift-9 you open a 'mini-menu'. Inside these windows you need to click right on some switches or left click. So far I remember one switch tells 'prepare for flying'. Another one says 'fly in easy mode' which you should select. 

Just look inside all menues and look for switches and left or right clicking the fields or switches. This will work. Take your time to learn all menues.

I have had some problems with textures (plane was in white without any color). For to fix this I looked inside each installed DO27-model (SimObjects\Airplanes\Digital Aviation Do-27). Inside each model folder there are some wrong .air- files (2k4....air). I deleted them except the needed one which is called Do-27_FSXv2.8.air and similar. 

As a next step I have changed the aa- and af-function inside the graphic card menu to  application managed. And inside FSX I switched off the antialiasing. This was for testing and now the DO27 is in fine colors as it should be!
Thereafter I have added af 2x in graphiccard adjustments. And IN FSX I have set antialiasing to ON again. Now the DO27 looks very very good.   

I think that all this can help you to fix all the problems with this so nice plane.

So Gentlemen, start your engine.. and fly this wonderful model. It's so easy that every child could fly..

- Sorry for my not perfect english ;-)"
,jncanticas,2010-12-07T08:58Z,"Hello, first of all thanks for uploading this file, it seems great.
