,babepuck,2007-07-24T23:40Z,I'll give it a try!  I HATE vodei so if it works there will be a little more love in the world!
,fryupfriday,2007-07-27T12:33Z,"Gave it a shot. Set up vpc, win98, and installed vodei. Worked through graphedit on the vpc but when I hit the play button it told me vodei had expired and I need to register. "
,dr_scottie,2007-07-31T17:17Z,doesn't work at all
,LordAlexMorgan,2007-09-14T19:32Z,"Yes, very good. It works indeed. This dr_scottie says it doesn't but i guess he slipped something along the way. The instructions are great and work 100%. Too bad the GraphEdit can't read mp3 and encode it. It makes the process sooooo much longer becuase i have to reconvert the new ""video-clean"" file into MPEG and then reconvert that one into divx. The PCM audio makes the new file twice as big so recompression is really nessesary, unless you want a 1.45 GB divx. 
So this is me praising you Wolf and for those wanting to rid themselves of the vodei go for it. I just have a problem in getting the Virtual Machine running, but that's coolio, i'll work out a solution. Cheers!"
