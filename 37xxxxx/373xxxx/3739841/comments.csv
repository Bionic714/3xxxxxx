liiiv spelt 'whole world' correctly, Using capital letters has nothing to do with spelling, this... in case you haven't noticed is THE INTERNET where we all write in lower case most of the time and use capitals to either shout or make a point. Now I suggest you go and take some lessons from your 7 year old regarding manners and speaking out of turn. FFS!

Run along now there's a good Canuk. "
