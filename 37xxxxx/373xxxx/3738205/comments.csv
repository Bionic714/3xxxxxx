,BigBoiG,2008-10-24T01:06Z,VIRUS ALERT - pettyr is attempting to douche up TPB with all his virus/spyware bullshit. All he did was copy[identically i might add] vicious129's torrent of the EXACT same filename and add viruses too it[judging by the minimal size difference between both torrents]
,NWRicky,2009-08-05T02:59Z,keygens are known as trojans but they are not
