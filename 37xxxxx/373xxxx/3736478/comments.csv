,Damorte,2007-07-10T17:17Z,its a collection with different fansubs.
,Damorte,2007-07-11T18:30Z,"Im sorry for the bad grammar and spelling in the info text, i was drunk and tired when i wrote it :p"
,Gimmicco,2007-07-14T12:52Z,"Absolutely great show, as soon as i get it, i'll be seeding a lot..."
,Gimmicco,2007-07-14T17:32Z,"In the mean time, i wouldn't mind some seeding.....please!!!???? ANYONE?????"

,Fargile,2007-07-25T16:13Z,Is it just me or does episode 36 and 37 come without subs? and can anyone tell me where to get them in that case?
,malcp,2007-08-08T00:58Z,They came with subs you just need to activate the subs on them. Since they didn't have a creditless of the second opening and ending thats why they did so. Im using VLC media player can play any format and easy to figure with. I just right clicked and activated the sub on each episode.
,Piratepimp,2007-08-20T18:11Z,"was it only me? but i took the time to down load and it had ep 1-25 and ep 35.  So from episode 26-34 ther is nothing at all?????/ all the rest is great quality though and thanks, but whats up with 26-34?? or 36 or 37???"
,SapphireBlood,2007-09-17T19:55Z,"episodes 26-37 are in the .mkv format and aren't showing up if you're just looking for files in Windows Media Player.

If you don't want to download a player or deal with the matroska codec, I recommend a program called AllToAvi from Sourceforge.net"
,Rhapsody1,2007-11-26T12:58Z,"Damorte, my man, awsome job uploading!

props to you for uploading one of the greatest animĂŠs out there!"

,xxletolovexx,2008-01-26T21:34Z,"ello folks, i'm downloading this brilliant torrent as we speak. But can somebody just inform me if it is dubbed in english ^.^?"
,kankuro213,2008-01-30T05:14Z,"xxletolovexx, can you not read?
Death Note [Episode 1-37 All ENG subbed]
subbed, as in with subtitles
which means its japanese audio
no one wants to watch a crappy eng dub"
,Mavenstar,2008-01-30T14:25Z,I run a pretty fast rig and it took me like 3 days to convert all of the files out of matroska and into AVI. Does anyone want me to upload the 1-37 all AVI format?
,dm87,2008-02-17T10:31Z,"Hey Mavenstar, I would love for you to upload ep 1-37 in all avi. I'd def appreciate it. Thanks"
,starion88esir,2008-02-27T02:27Z,Mavenstar - Please do!
,abrah555,2008-05-22T09:23Z,wtf is wrong w/ this it freezes often and skips entire minutes of the show.  Annd some of the later episodes don't work at all.
,rayano,2008-06-07T20:58Z,what's the fansub for the first 25 episodes?
,Damorte,2008-06-09T22:24Z,"If you are running in to problems using theese video files, please try to use VLC to play them with before complaining. "
,Starayo,2008-06-23T17:28Z,"Sometimes even VLC has problems - try using media player classic if that's the case.

Only annoying thing is that the keyboard shortcuts are different. >_"
,maximumrisk2004,2008-07-29T18:28Z,My Utorrent always says that the torrent is damaged
,infidelis,2008-08-13T02:04Z,seed pls!
,666LordAlucard,2008-09-07T12:32Z,"NECESSARY CODEC to play the .mkv format on windows media player can be found at the link below. This download contains several diffrent codecs that are quite useful but you can also choose to skip the ones you don't want.

And thanks for the upload. Great quality and everything, couldn't have asked for more!"

,Domyras,2008-10-14T20:04Z,"So...
this is in english?
not with English subtitles or wha?"
,Domyras,2008-10-14T20:07Z,"ok got it.
but i never heard of .mkv
what vid players play this and whats all this negative comments? Oo
it IS good right? Oo"
,mrpras,2009-01-22T23:40Z,"a lot of noobs on here

here's a tip

instead of spamming a board like this with comments like ""what's an MKV"" and ""what language is it in?""

why not

Use those brain cells and LOOK
and use google to find out what MKV is and don't whine here.

Also a tip - ffdshow is way better than other free multicodecs imo, try it
http://www.free-codecs.com/download/FFDshow.htm"
,killbethy,2009-02-11T21:50Z,"despite how easy it is to play mkv on your computer, if people are trying to translate it to windows media extender to play on their tv via xbox... it's much easier to do with an avi file (so you convert it, it usually takes a little longer to convert the episode than the actual playtime)than to mess with all the settings to get it to play mkv.

does anyone know what subbers are included in this batch?"
,killbethy,2009-02-11T21:52Z,"sorry for double post, i'm not sure who the first subbers are, but i do know that kuro-hana and ruberia have quite a few typos.  but i believe they were also the only fansub groups to actually finish death note, since it was licensed right before it finished airing in japan."
,theRealKarmine,2009-05-02T09:19Z,the grammar errors and spelling make it apparent that english in not their natural language.  but it doesnt matter.
,Lexiconic,2009-08-29T01:27Z,VLC's as awesome as Windows.
,Grynn1990,2009-11-05T06:13Z,plz seed people

,2Quadit,2010-07-01T06:11Z,"i'm downloading the first episode now, why is it ""ghost in the shell""? isn't this supposed to be death note?"
,phuphroo,2010-08-15T05:31Z,i got a lot of viruses while downloading this torrent im not sure if it was this torrent that caused it for sure but if I were you I would scan my system after downloading this.
,sidkid,2010-09-15T01:05Z,there is no episode 10.
,ex902,2010-10-25T21:34Z,thank you - all good
,e-santos,2010-12-25T18:05Z,"is there anyone who have english subs for this ? 

i download all episodes from diffrnt torrent but it has no english subs..!!

can u provide me english subs for deathnote ?"
,superik4,2011-02-06T12:20Z,episode 36 and 37 aren't subbed. plz fix.
,JuckleJack,2011-03-10T02:57Z,I never understand why there's some mkv and some avi but less converting I guess. Thanks for the torrent.
,00101010,2011-04-19T04:16Z,"Some .mkv and some avi because it's a compilation of the work of at least 2 subtitling groups.  IIRC this is the same project I worked on back in the day, which has two videos that DO have subs but you sometimes have to fiddle with your media player to get them to show up... but they ARE subtitled."
,marre999,2011-05-04T00:01Z,vlc have never failed for me ty for the upload loads of hugs and kisses :P
,GermzRox,2011-08-12T06:52Z,"This torrent is really sweet. Just one problem though. Episode 29 and episode 34 both are corrupted or something. I converted all the .mkv files to .avi because that file extension doesn't work on a PS3. When I tried to convert the 2 episodes listed above they would not convert because they were not supported by any player. So, be warned that even though this is the best Japanese w/english subs torrent I've seen for this particular series you are going to be missing 2 files unless the user fixes and reseeds it. If anyone has gotten those 2 episodes to work please let me know how you did. I just want them to work on my PS3."
,zerocomma,2011-08-31T16:40Z,"Virtually all of the episodes have hardcoded subs and most of those subs are poorly written, littered with poor English, typos, and awful grammar."
