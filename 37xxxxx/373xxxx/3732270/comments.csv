,lee369,2007-07-10T01:47Z,"Can You help me? I have downloaded everything for this - DVD1, DVD2 the updater and the Vsti files. When I try to unrar DVD 1 it says files are corrupt, and I can't un rar it. Now I see here that DVD 1 is not listed. Should I discard it and use only DVD2? I don't know where to begin with this. Please help. 
Thanks"
,PungKotlett,2007-07-10T20:32Z,"Umhh.. Dunno. I have a vague memory of having some problems with a 2nd extract, but I downloaded DVD1 from here, and it's running nicely on my PC now! 
I'd definately advice you to get both DVD's - much better that way... 

Start with the SFV file and unrar from there. 
(If it doesn't work, re-download) 
When you've got the files extracted you've got the possibility to unrar AGAIN.. if this is where you got stuck _don't do that_!! 

Run the extracted files with Daemon tools instead, and install it from a virtual DVD-drive. 

I think that's how I did it. "
,PungKotlett,2007-07-10T20:36Z,"Sorry, what I ment to say was ignore the SFV-file and start unpacking from any of the RAR-files... Sigh... "
,brandnew561,2007-07-15T21:11Z,ANYWAY TO GET THIS FOR MAC??? THIS IS THE ONLY THING I NEED BUT I CANT FIND A MAC ONE OUT THERE....PLEASE HELP!!!!!

,andolatut,2007-09-27T00:15Z,"Detta verkar ju va fantastiskt! Men...
Jag har laddat ner o installerat allt, men programmet hittar inte ljudfilerna. De kom ju som två stora ISO-filer. Ska man dela upp dem med nåt verktyg i småfiler? I så fall vilket verktyg? Hur gör man annars? Det funkar varken när jag kör det i Nuendo som vsti eller som stand alone. Snälla hjälp, jag vill så gärna att det ska funka."
,andolatut,2007-09-27T00:20Z,"This seems really great!!! But...
I´ve downloaded and installed everything, but the program doesn´t find the sound files. They came as two big ISO-files. Are you supposed to split them up into smalles files with some tool, and if that is the case, which tool? How do you do otherwise? It doesn´t work neither as a vsti in Nuendo nor as a stand alone. Please help, I really want this to work!!!"
,AmpSim,2007-09-27T17:22Z,"Use Dameon Tools to load the .ISO files as virtual ""fake"" CD drives onto your PC, it's easy as pie.  
Download and install dameon tools, then right click on the small dameon tools icon in your taskbar,  Go to ""CD/DVD ROM"", then go to (F:\), and click on ""Mount Image"".   Now select the .ISO files which you have extracted from this torrent.

Once you have mounted the ISO files, go to my computer and a Virtual CD drive (F:/) will be there."

,hersw,2009-07-23T06:20Z,"Mac Users:

If you have Parallels or VMWare Fusion, all you have to do is move the instrument folder to a place where the windows installer can access it, and then choose that location as where the library is located during the installation; it sucessfully updated my library on an intel mac running 10.5.7."
