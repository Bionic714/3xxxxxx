,fruitjam,2007-12-10T00:53Z,"I don't seem to be getting any of this fun. I am trying to download all the 20 albums but sofar nothing has come down since a bit more than a day! Is it abandoned or just irregular seeding. It says that there are 12 Seeders and 7 Leechers, but like I said nothing is downloaded yet. Maybe I came in late but please consider seeding a bit more!  I always seed minimum 3-4 times of what I take out. 
Thanks in advance
