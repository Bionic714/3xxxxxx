American Yodeling

American Yodeling 1911-1946 - 26 wonderful examples of "inarticulated singing from the 
throat" and low-down, high-up vocal trickery by some of the best. Some classics like 
Emmett Miller's divine "Lovesick Blues", Bill Monroes's "Mule Skinner" alongside some 
absolute killer unknowns (to me) like the DeZurik Sister's boggling performance of 
"Arizona Yodeler" which is wearing my repeat button out! And then, there's 
Cliff Carlisle's "Nasty Swing" an object lesson in restraint and power that is a 
perfect showcase for his fine yodeling style. Some folks might feel that a full 
album of yodelling pre-war old-timey songsters and bluesmen might get a bit tiring 
but they's be wrong! This is a terrific set of exciting performances, perfectly 
sequenced by Christoph Wagner, the perfectionist who gave us Trikont's other 
classic album "Black & White Hillbilly Music", I think this will do just as 
well as that gem!
