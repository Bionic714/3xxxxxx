I noticed that the latest "intermediate" eMedia guitar method available on the torrent world was Guitar 2, which has been replaced
by this intermediate guitar method. This is also due to the request of the guy that uploaded Guitar Method 1 (ver.2) many thanks to him! :)

Anyway, as far as I know this is the latest version of intermediate guitar method. Guitar Method 1 is currently in version 3, but the latest version "online" is v.2 So if anyone might happen to have version 3, plz upload it :)

This CD brings the intermediate course, if u want the beginners course, it's available here:

here is a sample of a user review of the product:

"Intermediate Guitar Method is incredible! Unlike Guitar Method 2 it has an animated fretboard just like in GM1. It has also expanded it's lesson library from 85 to 175 lessons. It has an expanded chord dictionary with over 1,000 chords providing sound for each chord (a huge step up from GM1's 250 chord dictionary). What I didn't like about GM1 was that it seemed to focus on using the acoustic guitar. Many of the recordings (Clapton, Hendrix) in IGM are played with an electric, which offers a nice balance between the two. The techniques that are learned in IGM are advanced, but I'm convinced that there is no other software available that will make them easier to learn or more enjoyable to play."

GM1 = Guitar Method 1
