   Kursk '43 covers the gigantic German Summer Offensive in 1943, when
   they attempted to cut off the huge bulge in the Soviet lines near the
   town of Kursk. This is without question the largest Panzer Campaign
   game in the series, as the action over the entire bulge (north and south
   offensives) is covered.
