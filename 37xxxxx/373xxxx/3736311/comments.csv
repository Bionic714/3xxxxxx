,navy5915,2007-07-11T21:12Z,i scanned this torrent with mcafee and found a New Malware.ec Trojan in the file what i did was after this torrent was done than i burned it to a disk and deleted it and the trojan was off my pc and you can use it as many times as you like i have for a long time and as long as you dont copy this patch to your computer you will be safe i run windows xp
,BustaRibs,2007-07-11T21:59Z,thats ok but the malware will still be in the patch so when you use it it will infect your pc mate!
,DaRkLiGhT69,2007-07-12T00:30Z,Strange.. i scanned it but did not find anything. Just a file the patched my xoftspy so i could use the latest version without any key :D
