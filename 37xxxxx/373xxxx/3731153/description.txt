Gorillaz - Demon Days Live
      Putting on a live concert featuring the music of a cartoon band 
      is ambitious enough. Planning a full performance of Demon Days
      in its entirety and bringing together the star musicians who 
      appeared on the album should be almost impossible! However, 
      that's exactly what happened at the Manchester Opera House. 
      With Gorillaz members Murdoc and 2D watching from the Royal Box, 
      Damon Albarn and his band in silhouette amidst massive 
      coloured light boxes, were joined by the Demon Days guest stars 
      plus a choir, a string orchestra and entire class of school children 
      for this amazing live event. As a stunning backdrop of animated art
      played behind them, the album was performed from start to finish with 
     appearances from collaborators including De La Soul, Ike Turner, 
     Neneh Cherry and Shaun Ryder. Impossible or not,
     the Demon Days visual extravaganza, filmed in HD, 
     delivers a unique theatrical experience.
