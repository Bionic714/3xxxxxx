After I uploaded a couple of recent issues of this magazine, several people requested more.  So...here it is.


This file contains all 12 of the 2006 issues of Computer Pilot magazine, and it also includes all available support files from their website.  For some months, they offer supporting files with maps, wallpaper, charts, and other supporting docs for articles in the magazine (not every month), and I have included all of those files.


It is important to note that they have put a password protection on some of their files, and I have included all of the necessary passwords.


This is the complete 2006 set.


Enjoy!!!
