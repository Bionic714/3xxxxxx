XP Codec  is  the best Codec I found on the net for free  I couldnt hear my sound for my dvd or anything  I played on my media players  I install this  so easily I thought it would not work either but when I tried it worked!! Finaly  I found something that  works  great so if you have this problem try XP CODEC  you wont regret it man ...
