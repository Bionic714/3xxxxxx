,hejmeddig123,2007-07-12T22:43Z,Can I play this if I have vista..??
,4X-AXG,2007-07-13T01:00Z,"no, the loader does not work with Vista"
,DaftHonk,2007-07-13T03:27Z,The installer/unwrapper works fine in Vista.  You may however need to de-activate User Account Control or setup both executables to run as Administrator.
,4X-AXG,2007-07-14T22:01Z,oh really? hmm that is interesting..I do no have Vista so I cannot test it..but thanks for the tip

,Spitfire7,2008-10-15T21:23Z,"Why is this not working at all for me?

I have installed all of the Blocks Versions from 4X-AXG and I have put everything on the lowest graphics and still when I select the plane from the main menu there's no picture. Its just white. Then when I go to fly, all I see is just a white screen. Every once in a while after selecting other views I can see the plane for a few seconds, but it is the slowest I have ever seen a game run on my PC and then the whole screen goes white again. I even have PMDG 747 and it runs great. So its not my computer, I must be missing something else or doing it wrong. Please help. Also, when installing it, it would only install with the loader and it seemed to install fine. When I tried to click and drag the exe. file on top of the loader as instructed in one of the read me files, I just got an error message saying it cant find that exe. file. Please help. Oh and I have FSX. Would SP1 or SP2 have anything to do with it?  When I installed just the outer texture for the plane it seemed to open fine since it didn't have the VC or correct cockpit.  As soon as I installed the version with cockpit everything goes crazy.
