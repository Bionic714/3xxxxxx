help plz?"
,metal_man_409e,2007-11-27T20:49Z,"The main executable (empires2.exe) does not work when i start a single player game, however it works when in training. The Expansion Pack executable works a charm though, cheers.

Oh yeah, the original executable for the main game was cracked using the crack situated in the crack.zip folder. no worries, the expansion pack is great! "
