,robhol92,2007-07-03T07:36Z,"Also, if anybody would be willing to upload the rest of 'Eine Art Suite in XIII Teilen' I'd be grateful forever.."
,robhol92,2007-07-20T20:06Z,"All right, this marks the day when I drop this torrent. Since statistics show that I've sent the entire file almost 18 times over, I don't really see how the FUCKING HELL the avail. rate is at 1.7. You leechers; stop being leechers. It's annoying to everybody else. Seed yourself. I MAY be able to seed again sometime in the future. If you care, post, and don't curse my arse off.. just ask."
