Driven to the brink of extinction on ice-covered wastelands, humankind
fights to survive. Battle to survive against gargantuan alien Akrid
and treacherous Snow Pirates on the vast and frozen landscape of EDN III.
With no allies at your side, the only thing you can trust is your instincts.

Combining a gripping single player campaign and intense multiplayer
modes with support for up to 16 players online, Lost Planet is an
epic gaming masterpiece. Enormous world maps unfold as players
battle across vast snow fields and deserted cities either
on foot or in armed, robotic Vital Suits.
