,gtr2,2007-07-06T23:28Z,"I love it! dopemans amazing at removing only the shit you wont need or want anyway from a game. 

My biggest love is console style gaming. Just pick a game you want to play unrar that bitch and play! I now own the game, the game doesnt own my pc. Its great! 
THX again dopey."

,420dopeman,2007-07-07T01:31Z,"lol ace, ... I guess it has been a while since I shared anything so non-explosive. 
This game makes up for it with its big fat 'M' for mature rating. Lots of trash talkin and plenty of ass kickin.

cheers mate.

,ashhloe,2007-07-07T17:30Z,"Cool game . thanks.
IronyOnline: maybe try checking games requirements or something. I never had a problem with even one of them. There's gotta be something wrong with your system. I even pass all his games to my mates without a hitch. "

,IronyOnline,2007-07-08T02:12Z,"ashhloe: 
I passed the req's with flying colours.

I can't make whats wrong with it....

Got a P4 2.2 gHz, 1.5+Ram, 128mb ATI Pro, and more than 10 Gig's of HD left...
That should do it, allright."
,420dopeman,2007-07-08T14:04Z,"Ah yes, indeed, very nice Spectre2011.

YOU CAN NOT START THE GAME FROM WITHIN THE FOLDER THAT CONTAINS MY NIC. MOVE IT ELSEWHERE.

This is partly my fault because I never stress this, but, with ALL games you should put the folder in a more respectable place, i.e. create a gaming folder like c:\Gaming or just place them in your programs folder. Games are not movies and some do require a legit path to run. Running any game from within my nic can be bad news...

thanks again spectre. I may re-up this just to ammend the description."

 Greetings fellow pirates.

 There is indeed a new enemy amongst torrents and they are trying to control
 all good gaming torrents everywhere. Leeching and dumping data, not sharing
 a bit of data, which is making it near impossible to download many torrents.

 I have included a dopeman_blocklist.txt file. YOU MUST load this file to
 Peerguardian as an addtional blocklist -or- load the file to whatever means
 of IP blocking you have available to your BT Client.

 If you do not, you will simply be sharing data to these cowards and not other
 legit torrent users trying to download. 

 Please try to understand the importance of this. It must be used to begin
 saving game torrents everywhere. This is a new enemy. We must do our best 
 to fight back to preserve our freedom of sharing. 

 Please use the blocklist and share it anyway you can.

 dopeman"

,NeftyPR,2008-06-16T03:56Z,"ATTENTION!!!!

100% fix for the slayer problem.READ CAREFULLY!!

You must have the game running on this path:

C:/Programs Files/Atari/Marc Ecko's Getting Up - Contents Under Pressure

*(This is the correct name of the folder :
Marc Ecko's Getting Up - Contents Under Pressure) 

If u dont know how to put the game on that path follow this instructions.

1.Download the game
2.Unrar it anywhere you want
3.Go to My Computer
4.Local Disk
5.Programs File
6.Create a new folder called Atari (In Programs File)
7.Grab the folder you unrared and drop it on the Atari folder (the one u made just a second in programs file)
8.Rename (the folder u dropped to Atari folder) to Marc Ecko's Getting Up - Contents Under Pressure (Only if its necessary)

If you are having the problem anyway then maybe its because you have the visual effects on low (this is for best performance). 
You must put em back to windows default setting.To put it on default xp settings: 

1.Press Start
2.Press the right click on My Computer Icon
3.Hit Properties
4.Go to advanced Tab
5.Where it says Performance, hit Settings
6.In Visual Effects tab select the ""Let Windows choose what's the best for my computer"" option then hit ok

This would fix all slayer problems if you have it on the correct path(at least for me).

If u have any doubt comment it and spread it because alot of people had the slayer problem and no one helped em.

Hope this helped all and i will be seeding :)"
,NeftyPR,2008-06-16T04:01Z,"And for those having 10 times speed or any o ther audio or video problems maybe its ur computer.

3rd step. look under process and find the game

You need to run the ""GettingUp.exe"" file in compatibility mode. To do this, right click the file and go to Properties, click the compatibility tab, and check off the ""Run this program in comparability mode for,"" and then select Windows 98/Windows ME.

P.S. Thanks for the great upload Dopeman, love the game."
