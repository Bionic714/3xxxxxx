I appreciate the sentiment, but you have to make this more viral. The rifftrax pirates aren't going to help seed this.

In what format is it? Can it be compressed to divx or xvid? Like I said, 'Tube-ing it would probably get better exposure."
,OmniaVorbis,2007-07-09T11:13Z,"It's just a mirrored image of the rifftrax donate site with audio from... office space, I think. Apparantly stealing audio from Mike Judge is fine, but stealing it from Mike Nelson isn't.

I think that we should steal from Lord Admiral Horatio Nelson so that we can assertain if the surname denotes whether or not it's okay to steal audio."
,Supreme2k,2007-07-09T19:02Z,"Actually, Mike and the crew were writers on MST3K, and have Joel's blessing on the Rifftrax project. Them not being the ""original riffers"" is less important than coming up with the concepts and such.

The modified movie posters are a form of parody, which is protected from copyright infringement. They *could* ask for permission (as Weird Al does), but they don't -need- to ask."
,NoDancingNotAllowed,2007-07-09T22:46Z,"yeah, I can youtube it.  I tried the other day but I was uploading this file at the time to some people and youtube wasn't getting enough juice.  I'll re-youtube it.  Glad you guys like it."
,NoDancingNotAllowed,2007-07-09T22:48Z,I put this file at the beginning when I burn my rifftrax videos for a friend of mine so that he remembers to pay 3 bucks to Rifftrax.  We both want Rifftrax to stick around because we were both so bummed when the Sci-Fi channel cancelled the show.
,NoDancingNotAllowed,2007-07-10T00:01Z,here you go guys...and again thanks for your kind comments:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCH5fp2d4ak
,NoDancingNotAllowed,2007-07-10T00:13Z,"Tit-o:  Mike Nelson was a writer on the show from Season 2....coincidentally that is when the show started getting good.  Kevin Murphy has been on the show since season 1.  Personally, I think Bill Corbett is the best Crow.  Although I like Trace as well.  If Joel was still into doing this kind of stuff he would be.  There is no theft.  Just some punks flushing Rifftrax down the toilet by not supporting Mike and the guys who work there.  Cough up 3 bucks you cheap bastards.  It is not a basic human right to be entertained."
,OmniaVorbis,2007-07-10T12:24Z,Dancing; gain a sense of Psychology. Why would angering people make them donate money? Phil was doing perfectly fine with the guilt before you came along acting like an arsehole which has pretty much just generated a sense of determination to steal riffs merely to spite you!
,NoDancingNotAllowed,2007-07-10T22:29Z,"Yeah, I don't give a shit what you ungrateful bastards do.  I just like pissing on your parade.  Makes me all gigglely.  Thanks again."
,OmniaVorbis,2007-07-11T09:23Z,Pissing on our 'parade' by doing what? You haven't done anything!
,NoDancingNotAllowed,2007-07-12T02:10Z,I do things!
,acidoklysm,2007-07-18T22:17Z,"Shutup. Don't call us cheap bastards just because we pirate something you happen to believe in. You are on a torrent site, obviously pirating something yourself. And I'm sure someone else cares a lot about whatever gay porn vids you are stealing. The fact is that although I enjoy Rifftrax and wish for all involved to continue, I simply can't afford to pay for every single thing I enjoy. I like too much shit. I steal these things because if paying were my only option, I'd never buy them.

And how expensive is it to rent a dvd and record yourself making fun of it?"
,NoDancingNotAllowed,2007-07-19T00:59Z,"Actually I only torrent home made gay porn, so there is no copyright involved."
,cybergoon,2007-08-08T08:42Z,"You know guys, I know MST3K is funny and shit, but maybe some of us just want to check out a Rifftrax and make sure it's good before we pay money on the internet for something that ends up blowing, or we want to test the synch lest it not work too good with our setup before we buy. Rifftrax should really release one of their older Mike Nelson-only trax for free so that their system can be tested, a taste would probably make people eager for more. I understand lots of people are probably pirating with no intention to pay, but those people would likely never pay anyway, either due to being too poor or too stingy or not being able to pay for things online. So this video is pointless. Also it is stupid and uncreative and you can't read the text on Youtube."
,cybergoon,2007-08-08T08:49Z,"Oh yeah, and because you have decided to be a self-righteous asshole, and try to mask your ""I'm better than you"" smarminess behind some anti-piracy moral standpoint, a bunch of people are gonna be pissed and they'll probably work twice as hard to spread the files because of you. Nice job."
,PumaMan,2007-08-25T21:36Z,"""Actually I only torrent home made gay porn, so there is no copyright involved.""  

I hear you.  I only torrent homemade tapes of fat people having sex with animals.  BTW My wife has a crush on Mike when he dresses like a woman on the skits.  (Sorry mike you can have to pay for her phone no... just send 2.99 to Kobras International)

I torrented the daredevil dub here.  so I bot Independence day riff but Im having trouble synching it.   Sure would be nice if somebody could dub that and seed it?  I'll gladly make another 2.99 donation to you or whoever for it, and can help them coseed it."
,conjunctionjunction,2007-09-29T05:05Z,"Just a few notes:

The poster/parody comment was spot on.  It's not illegal to parody images.

Mike was not only a write from season 2 on, he was HEAD writer.  As for Joel coming up with the idea, I used to make fun of movies back in the early 80s with my older brothers.  So does that mean we get to sue Joel?  It was a common idea placed into a different context, just as rifftrax takes that idea and puts it into ANOTHER context.

The video is stupid and pointless.  I'm also relatively sure that it wasn't created or posted by anyone involved in Rifftrax.

And I like that some of you are honest about torrents--you are stealing, and you admit this.  It doesn't make it better, but it means you aren't full of shit, which is nice.  The comment about entertainment not being a basic right is very true.  But at least you aren't being delusional about it, and I'm sure if you got caught you would cough up the fine with a good ol' ""fair cop, guv"", wouldn't you?

Also, homemade gay porn is, at least in the United States, protected by copyright law.  Technically anything created is protected under copyright law.

,Jimkale,2007-12-14T21:19Z,"I have a feeling that if the choice is between not seeing it, and getting it free, they'd want you to see it.

Pirating things is usually low quality, and low selection, if you really want something with no funny business, you'd buy it. Piracy defeats itself. 
As a huge MST fan, I'm in favor of supporting them, but I'd prefer they just Creative Commons it and let donations pay for it. They have a HUGE fan base, and not much expense except time."
,administron,2008-04-05T06:27Z,"""... if you really want something with no funny business, you'd buy it.""

I'd rather spend a few hours getting a simple CD-sized rip of a movie than pay cash to get a dual-layer DVD loaded with advertisements, silly animated menus, and unskippable copyright warnings - and if I wanted to rip a movie I bought so I could play it on a portable, or I wanted to copy it so I could take it with me somewhere and not risk damaging or losing the original, I'd be violating copyright law most places anyway.  Hell, I'd be breaking the law if I wrote or even uploaded a program that helped people copy (or even play, but I'm not sure about that) DVDs, for free use or otherwise.  Much of the time, piracy is easier, simpler, and more straightforward, and what you do with the things you get legitimately might be breaking the law anyway.

The problem holding back the buy-if-you-like idea is that now, people expect to buy (rentals, tickets, DVDs, etc.) before they try.  If you switch to a system where people can get stuff free, and then they can donate if they like it, then unfortunately most people would just stop reading at the ""free"" part, get a copy, and forget about funding it.  Change would be slow, but well worth it if successful."
,conjunctionjunction,2008-05-27T12:15Z,"Actually, Administron, you wouldn't.  You're legally allowed to create an archived back-up of media you purchase, provided it is for your use and you abide by the same rules/laws that govern the original, and provided that the user agreement doesn't prohibit this.

Arguing the morality of piracy is sort of like debating the finer points of creamed corn with a brick wall--sure, you're right TO YOU, but the wall couldn't give less of a shit.  The fact is it is illegal, so do it if you want, don't if you don't, but stop TALKING about it."
,Weeaboo,2009-07-14T09:03Z,"If it cost Mike a dime every time I downloaded his work I would stop because I like his work. No one loses money through piracy they just don't gain more money. Stop calling it stealing, theft involves someone loosing something and hypothetical money can't buy shit anyway, in fact I will give you 1,000 hypothetical dollars to shut up."
