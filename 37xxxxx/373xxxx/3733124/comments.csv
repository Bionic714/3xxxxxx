thank you for this complete great series, krackaboi!"
,blackbox_jones,2010-12-24T05:15Z,"I'm having problems too, but only with part 1.  Other parts play fine for me, and in fact, I originally downloaded this torrent a few years ago with success, but I lost it (DVDs suck for long-term archiving; let's hope external hard drives fare better.)  

So now, Part 1 not only won't play, it seems to crash my computer every single time I attempt it.  Apparently, some sort of corruption has taken place somewhere in the life of the torrent?  Is anyone else having similar issues?  And if so, could someone re-upload if they've got a good copy?

I'm going to try to get my part one from somewhere else."
