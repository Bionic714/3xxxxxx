,lanc545,2007-07-08T20:14Z,"It appears there may be a seeding problem.
I'm showing 16 connected peers and 47 unconnected peers but no seeding. The fsx version is going gangbusters.

Thx"
,gdavej,2007-07-08T20:30Z,"I think the problem is: when I created the torrent in Azureus, I forgot to check ""Open torrent for seeding"". I've had another go, and this time (as with the FSX torrent), I checked this box, so hopefully all should be good. So please cancel this download, and go to

Sorry about messing up... as I said this was my first seed."
