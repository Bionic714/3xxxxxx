,joannellis,2007-07-05T05:54Z,"Hmm...I agree, a great album without a doubt.  Definitely straightforward, in terms of x amount of rock numbers in a row, differing the album from the more concept-oriented ones.  These tend to be my favs overall - Going For The One, Tales From Topographic Oceans, Relayer.  

What do you think of those?
Peace...and glad you like the tunes!
