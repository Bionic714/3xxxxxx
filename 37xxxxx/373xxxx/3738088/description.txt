:. title .:

..:: Chicken Little Ace in Action! (c) Walt Disney -English rip- ::..

:. about .:
 
The crew faces off  against  Foxy  Loxy  and her evil Amazonian sidekick, 
Goosey Loosey,  who  have an evil plan to take over Earth. Battle evil alien  
robots through multiple levels across the solar system and combat your foes in 
one of three distinct gameplay modes: Ace on foot as a soldier, Runt as the 
driver of an  armored  tank and Abby as the pilot of a spaceship.                           
                                                                       
The original Chicken Little and his friends Abby, Runt and Fish we know from the 
original film are  featured  in  cut scenes throughout the game. 
Chicken Little receives a copy of the latest video game starring his superhero alter  
ego and invites his friends to come over  and  play  the  game with him, in effect 
creating a "video game within a  video game".
