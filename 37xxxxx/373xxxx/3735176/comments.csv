,goro_999,2007-07-08T13:36Z,Any chance for the FS2004 version?

Microsoft Flight Simulator x / 2004

"
,alex06ze,2007-07-08T17:16Z,Yep work for fs2004 ;)
,goro_999,2007-07-08T21:03Z,"@alex06ze:

AFAIK, the versions for FSX and FS2004 are different, although they come in the same package of altogether 6 DVDs."
,eNuffSaid,2007-07-09T11:28Z,"goro is right,

The original (retail) package comes with 6 DVDs. 3 are for FSX and 3 for FS2004 (FS9).

The FSX file cannot be used for FS9 and vice versa."
,Amerialb,2007-07-09T16:13Z,"Request-- FS2004 Cargo Pilot, only seed it to 99.9% and then kill it."
,4X-AXG,2007-07-10T01:52Z,"alright guys, don't panic, but I'm gonna give my computer (and myself ;-) some rest for the night..so seeding will stop for the night, but again don't panic, tomorrow seeding will continue until there are enough seeders to keep the ball rolling :)"
,BReeves588,2007-07-10T07:20Z,Please Seed everyone is stuck at 92.0% will upload a Terabyte for this collection.
,ssdar,2007-07-10T15:55Z,"can anyone explain how to install , i have dvd 2 allready but can't seem to open it with daemon ."
,zoidzoid,2007-07-10T16:55Z,Same problem here. DVDs cannot be mounted with DAEMON or PowerISO successfully.
,zoidzoid,2007-07-10T16:57Z,"Problem solved: Just move the images to your DVD1 directory, both for CD2 and CD3."
,zoidzoid,2007-07-10T16:58Z,"Clarification: It reads it straight from the DVD1 install directory, so just move the 3 images for DVD2 and DVD3 all into your DVD1 directory (the one with Setup.exe)."
,ssdar,2007-07-10T17:18Z,thanks for explaining ! 
,zoidzoid,2007-07-10T17:26Z,"When trying to enter terraincfg, I get error: ""Component 'COMDLG32.OCX' or one of its dependencies not correctly registered: a file is missing or invalid."""

,rajk1,2008-01-09T12:05Z,Component 'COMDLG32.OCX' or one of its dependencies not correctly registered: a file is missing or invalid
,rajk1,2008-01-19T18:42Z,"to fix the 'COMDLG32.OCX'  problem, uninstall and switch of all antivirus software and install again"
,DaftHonk,2008-02-23T22:58Z,"Do a search for COMDLG32.ocx, download to your system32 folder and register with ""regsvr32 COMDLG32.ocx"" in the Windows Run dialogue.  Much faster than a reinstall."
