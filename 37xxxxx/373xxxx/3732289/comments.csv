The theoretical maximum seeding rate from this computer is 8 Mbit / s. This account will seed between 12 and 24 hours a day for at least a few weeks, after which it will probably be reduced somewhat.

Expect most seeding to occur during daytime in Sweden. Sweden is in the CET (Central European Time) zone.

CET is either (a) ""standard CET"" = GMT +1 or (b) ""summer CET"" = GMT +2.  (GMT = Greenwich Mean Time.)

PLEASE NOTE that inquiries are to be made via the YouTube-account for which a link has been supplied in the main description."
,CMANHG,2007-07-04T20:22Z,"Although almost the entire bandwidth has been devoted to seeding this single torrent, some users apparently are getting slow downloads.

Please be patient; upload will continue as promised, from this computer. If many people keep seeding, this music DVD with Beethoven's and Rachmaninoff's beautiful music will become available to a great many people across the world."
,CMANHG,2007-07-05T00:56Z,"If anyone has suggestions for solving the following problem, please let me know.

- When seeding a file different from the present one (the Beethoven DVD) is activated, in a brief experiment, I attain seeding rates several times higher than the total seeding rate attained for the Beethoven DVD - even when I had ten active peers for the Beethoven DVD spread out over several continents, with broadband connections and a lot of free bandwidth.

Why does this particular upload seed so slowly from my computer, when other seeding occurs more rapidly from the this same computer, at the same time? Just a coincidence and likely to improve?"
,CMANHG,2007-07-05T19:10Z,"Strange: a few hours after that the upload rate suddenly increased with a factor four, every single ""leecher"" (of which nine were then active) for this torrent suddenly disappeared, at the same time. The leechers came from various countries (Portugal, Japan, Russia, the Netherlands, Germany and USA) and other torrents were fully operational at the same time.

Explanation?"
,CMANHG,2007-07-07T14:37Z,Seeding works perfectly now and several people are helping across the world. Download rates for individual peers have peaked at about 0.6 Mb(ytes) / sek.
,RAWLS111616,2007-07-08T09:21Z,"Thanks for making and seeding this torrent, saved my ass for my music class.
Great speeds too.
Thanks again."
,CMANHG,2007-07-08T12:27Z,"""RAWLS111616"": It is good to hear that you found the video useful! Good luck with your music studies."
,CMANHG,2007-07-08T12:33Z,"Some reviews from the music critics in the newspapers for this concert:

""A tour-de-force of good taste and analytical skill."" (NSD, Luleå, Sweden, October 2001.)

""...not a single tone is left unattended."" (NSD, Luleå, Sweden, October 2001.)

""...a performance of international proportions."" (NSD, Luleå, Sweden, October 2001.)

""...his playing seems devoid of technical difficulty."" (NK, Luleå, Sweden, October 2001.)"
,CMANHG,2007-07-08T12:35Z,"This DVD will be uploaded, eventually, also as separate, smaller torrents; one for each of the compositions performed."

,CMANHG,2007-07-19T17:26Z,"An additional quote from a review for this concert:

""[This] was Giordano's orchestral debut - and what a debut... ...Giordano carries us through the story with exquisite sensitivity... ...carefully interpreted... ...the phrases flow effortlessly from the piano... deeply engaged in the music... ...very promising for the future.""

Måns Nilsson, Norrländska Socialdemokraten, Sweden, October 29, 2001."
,CMANHG,2007-07-21T12:06Z,"Again - seeding is appreciated. At times, ten people have been trying to download this film simultaneously and I am the only one seeding. This results in so low download rates that people give up.

If you enjoyed the music, you may regard seeding it for a few days to other listeners as a suitable form of compensation."

Do not give up if noone is seeding when you add the torrent - seeding will generally occur within a few days, at the most, if this computer has been shut off for some reason.

Of course seeding by others is always appreciated."
,CMANHG,2007-08-13T21:31Z,"The dowload counter in the top right corner either malfunctions severely or operates with some kind of delay; I draw this conclusion, since the counter said 38 downloads last evening and still says so now, although at least four, and possibly more, people have completed their downloads since then."
,CMANHG,2007-08-15T14:58Z,"The download counter definitely does not work... Since the time when it said ""38"", at least ten people have downloaded the movie, but the counter says ""40""... :-("
,ClassicalMusicSweden,2009-02-08T20:59Z,"As usual, the number of leechers stated on this page cannot be trusted. Right now, the counter here on this webpage says that there are currently six leechers for this torrent - when my client (uTtorrent) counts 38!"
,ClassicalMusicSweden,2009-03-23T14:24Z,"What's this? uTorrent says 62 leechers right now for this torrent - explaining the rather slow download, with only three seeders - but the counter on this page says ""3"" leechers (and ""1"" seeder)!?"
