,ghostone,2007-07-14T16:26Z,"Well you guys
There's no need to be rude to people that can give you free program. What does this cost you? Just some time to download another torrent, nothing more. I think it's the lamest thing and probably the most stupid thing to complain over things that are free. Everyone can make mistakes and forget things, no need to give names or anything like that.
Great upload gabrieljj, and thank you for the effort! /Ghost"
,Machineheadrevo,2007-07-19T03:29Z,Man get his dick out of your mouth. This torrent is a fucking waste of time. If you're going to upload something in Portuguese label it that way.
