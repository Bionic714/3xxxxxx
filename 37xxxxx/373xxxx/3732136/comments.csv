,zkalos,2007-07-05T10:10Z,"Somebody seed the FS2CREW to the Feelthere Airbus please!(the downloaded version, not Flight1 installer, like the PMDG 747 FS2crew in TPB.)"
,Arrrr_Matey,2007-07-06T09:12Z,"This has been a request for awhile now... but I'm confused... is this the actual SP3a all-inclusive, or is a separate executable required?? I don't necessarily need an installer, unless it writes some files that aren't in this torrent. Please advise here...!! Thanks for the effort... Arrr!"

,Matt85,2008-01-28T09:47Z,You need to align the IRS. Once it is aligned (takes about 8 min) the warning disappeares and everything should work.
