before the old ones is ready
Hope the new modem works OK."
,eivindaamot,2007-08-01T15:12Z,"Help seeding people... There is many who wants this program. And remember, you have to find the serial by your self. I have NOT uploaded the serial key. But just go to www.serials.ws and find it there, works fine some of them ;)"

Im seeding a file 
""ProteusPROcracked install(Install this first. followed by the full CD) .rar""
Install this first, followed by the full CD. Use the reg file suggested when installing. Now everything works :)"
