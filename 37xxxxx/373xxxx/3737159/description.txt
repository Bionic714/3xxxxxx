All frequencies hailing!!

"c-base space station", which is a vital part of Berlin's governmentally unfunded subculture, is under pressing threat of closure. Until July, 31th 2007 we have to come up with several months' worth of outstanding rent, otherwise we'll be evicted and the space station will have to close.

If that happens an important and fertile ground for ideas and projects (e.g. Berlin's free wavelan networks "freifunk.net" and the wikipedia regulars' table ), event location (e.g. exhibitions, concerts, open stage sessions) and space for open knowledge transfer and last but not least a home for creatives, utopians and space cadets will disappear from Berlin's cultural landscape.
