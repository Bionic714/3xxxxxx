,philatio,2007-07-09T23:58Z,Don't bother. Fake. Only 95.5% exists. Fucking Viacom!!!! :(
,Vanayr,2007-07-10T00:52Z,"It's odd, it's definitly not a fake, as I can view most of it, but I'm stuck as well.  Let's hope the seeders are real that seem to be popping up."
,digitalfreaknyc,2007-07-10T02:36Z,"Patience.

I'm the ONLY seeder.  I don't know who else is out there. "
