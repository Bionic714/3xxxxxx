Surfing Soweto


"I always wanted to be a stuntman", says one of a growing number of disaffected youths that ride on top of speeding trains for a quick thrill. Hundreds of people have been killed "surfing" the trains -- dancing, ducking bridges and hanging from the sides. Most of the Soweto surfers come from broken homes in the impoverished South African township, spending their days drinking, smoking and performing their acrobatics.
