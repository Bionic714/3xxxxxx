,getragenzurkontroverse,2007-08-06T21:32Z,To play in a XP just press settings over the file and configure it to open with windows 95 
,huhheij,2007-08-09T17:15Z,why the game stops when barry kills the zombie that follows jill
,Ragnarokhel,2007-10-10T13:37Z,i get a grafic harddrive error? how to i fix it?
,matt198992,2007-10-13T19:02Z,"torrent does not work. there is either a file missing or the install.exe is corrupted. dont waste your time downloading. i have tried to run in compatibility mode with win 95, but that only solve part of it. i even took it to a win 95 computer and it still will NOT work. dont download."
,rj_dio,2007-12-05T19:16Z,Why is the game sped up? It runs really fast. How does one fix this?
,Godofallcows,2008-01-19T06:51Z,"HELP!@@##$!!

,deathkitten,2008-03-12T11:28Z,"I have the same problem as ""huhheij"" commented above, the game freezes when Barry kills the zombie that follows Jill :( 

Any way to fix this??? "
,deathkitten,2008-03-12T13:30Z,"I googled around and found a solution, if anyone else is using Windows XP this may be useful for you:
http://vogons.zetafleet.com/viewtopic.php?t=9978#105857

basically:
1. put this file http://vogons.zetafleet.com/download.php?id=4046 in your resident evil folder
2. open up command prompt by going to Start Run then typing in 'cmd'
3. use 'cd whatever' to change to different directories and 'dir' to list contents until you get to your resident evil directory
4. type in sdbinst re1.sdb
5. buy Mo'Slow 4biz from http://www.hpaa.com/moslo/4biz.asp online then set it up to have speed set to 12.98 (% normal) method 3 interval 1
6. Play the game with Mo'Slow or press the button at bottom to make a shortcut that always uses Mo'Slow with the same settings
7. Enjoy, I am :D dogs through wlal made me jump :3"
,maki_990,2008-04-26T12:03Z,how do u fix the zombie follows jill prob???
,tptxo,2008-06-12T04:32Z,"how do you fix the goddamn lockup when barry kills that zombie???

,burak89,2008-08-21T03:56Z,"Play with chris first,finis the game and then play with jill. here is the solution for the freeze :)"
,burak89,2008-08-21T03:58Z,i must be the biggest resident evil freak in history 
,burak89,2008-08-21T04:01Z,don't understand. why you download this psx games for pc from tpb? download the psx emulator and download psx roms. it's alot easier:)
,burak89,2008-08-21T15:06Z,ok i found an easier way to be not freezed in game.. when you first begin in the dining room don't go to the zombie's room. just go back to the hall and wesker will say something. then jill goes back to the dining room. then you go back to the hall and barry will talk ' Lost courrage already jill' will he say. then go from the side of the clock and the zombie will come from the door. IT WILL NOT FREEZE ANYMORE BE SURE;) Everybody say thankyou burak plz :p Lol if u have problem in resident evil games let me now i'm the solution for this game. enjoy

,SiavashTheOne,2011-06-16T18:46Z,"Simply had to change the color bit depth to 16-bit and play the game on Windows 7. By the way, anyone knows how to play in ""full-screen""? The screen is all black except a small ""window"" in which the game is shown. I want to expand that small box to cover the surface of the screen."
