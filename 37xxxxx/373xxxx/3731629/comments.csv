,dogengo,2007-07-04T15:02Z,"This is PC and that's why its in windows category,sorry i forgot to mention it. Its the complete install with one single serial key.So as always don't try to register online or connect for updates and such. Any questions welcome."
,xxxzeddiexxx,2007-07-04T19:31Z,"ThX for your reply.
Its a big download so I thought I should ask.
Could have been posted in the wrong category.
(Had encountered that before...)
Again, thank you for ""everything"", basically.

,dogengo,2007-07-06T15:14Z,"Thx for your reply xxxzeddiexxx, my torrent says i've uploaded 3.30 Gb so far and it's weird that not all the pieces have been made available. I'll keep seeding."
,dogengo,2007-07-10T00:52Z,I re-runed a test install and the working serial is the second on the list found in the text file. Remember not to allow auto updates or any connections to the net. Block it with firewall...
,UKbeast,2007-07-11T04:52Z,I downloaded and tried both serials and could not get the Landmark part to work. One gave me 2 components and the other gave me 3 components. Is there another serial number that will activate Landmark?
,dogengo,2007-07-11T19:01Z,I don't know why the serial for landmark is not working. I don't have any other serial right now but i'll check.
,dendirk,2007-07-12T09:14Z,"Anyoneone wants to share the keys with me?

Thanks"
,ejronin,2007-07-15T01:01Z,"As of right now there are no available keys for LandMark (which was my whole reason for DLing this). However, I'm sure one will pop up soon.

Just in case anyone had any thoughts about using BOTH keys (not the brightest idea, but one I'm sure has crossed a mind or three), it does nothing. Both keys are an ""A"" series license, but this has no bearing on what modules install, only what you can do with the installed modules. All of that is covered in the EULA. ""A"" series are for private use with no dongle (SN starts with anything EXCEPT B or C), ""B"" series are for commercial use WITH dongle (SN starts with B), and ""C"" series is for education, non-publishing / printing licenses (SN starts with C).

So, basically the SN provided are not for the whole design suite, but the ISO contains them. It's probably better if people search out the SN they need to unlock what modules they want - Architect, LandMark, Machine, RenderWorks, Fundamentals, etc...

Oh... and you can't update once installed, the serial will go dead on you and you'll have to uninstall / re-install to old ver."
,hagakureamm,2007-07-27T03:36Z,Anybody have any luck finding a LANDMARK serial? 
,barecola,2007-07-31T17:09Z,"Can you put the serial number here?
Do you have other serial to version 12?"
,kimlietear,2007-08-04T16:23Z,seed please...
,kimlietear,2007-09-16T15:09Z,hey I can't get the product key or serial can you send it to me please thanks.
,datoolbox,2007-09-23T16:35Z,"Nice UL, Does any one got a working serial for Spotlight + RenderWorks

Thnx"

,vpospe,2007-10-05T04:10Z,Thats the best i can do can anyone gimmy something better
,Lulani,2007-10-08T21:21Z,"Thanks for the upload!!

I'm new to this, so just to be sure: What do I have to do exactly to make sure there are no updates of any connections to the net?  Can I only open Vectorworks when my network connection is turned off?  How do I block it with firewall?...

Sorry for the inconvenience."
,gofler,2007-10-13T07:57Z,Hi this number from vpospe A2WUSZ-FZLKSL-ZQZ6ZD-G018UY work. But it unlock only architect + renderworks not Landmark. Does somebody have serial for Landmark??? ItÂ´s very important for me. Thank you
,jadiebaps1988,2007-10-15T21:16Z,"ive spend all day downloading this and my PC doesnt reconize the file! i cant open it with vector works 11 either, what do i do?"
,spitfire90,2007-12-18T05:27Z,"Anyone have the spotlight serial number... or know where to look?!?!  Be aware that on most of the warez sights that I looked, the serial downloaded is an application that will unload viruses!  Thankyou!"
,thrqn,2008-01-14T18:55Z,"can someone please help?
i have downloaded a torrent (i don't know if this is the one, i can't find any other that would match the description) that consists of like 20 rar files named vectorworks 12.5 part1, vectorworks 12.5 part2 etc.
in all of them there are same files - vectorworks pc.mdf, vectorworkspc.mds. 
in that torrent there is also an update to vw1 252from 1250 folder. 
i don't have the slightest idea what to do with this, how to install vectorworks?
thanks."
,mr_minayahoo.com,2008-02-13T14:40Z,"When I try to install this (after a really fast download) it just keeps telling me ""please select an existing installation of VectorWorks 12"". I don't have VW12, that's the reason why I'm downloading this stuff. (right now I'm running VW 11.5) I've tried  SN A2WUSZ-FZLKSL-ZQZ6ZD-G018UY and SN A2WUSZ-JZ4TGG-ZJZMZN-G00158. Both with the same result. Any suggestions? Please..."
,fullautosniper,2008-03-23T17:23Z,"ok, i am at a point where i see an MDF file that's quite large, and an MDS file, that's about 5kb. what do i do with these."

,melonez,2008-04-25T19:22Z,"Thanks for this mate, it works fine.
Just to help anyone having trouble, do this:
Get Alcohol 120, go to Image burning wizard and point to the MDF vector works pc image. 
Burn that to DVD then install using this serial number, I just installed it using this and works fine.

,Vogavt,2008-06-09T03:43Z,"@ Melonez,

Does this unlock Landmark too?"
,lizz84,2008-06-29T16:11Z,"Hello there,

Do i need a dongle for this download?
"
,lizz84,2008-06-29T16:54Z,"Thnx for this download! working perfect.

Use Daemon tools, virtual drive (no need to burn) and the second serial"
,mukkrukkis,2008-10-28T04:41Z,"I need help! I am so stupid that I don't even know what to do beyong clicking on ""download torrent.""  When I click that it downloads in about 2 seconds and then I see it in my program files but nothing happens when I click on it.  What program am I suppose to save it with?"
,mukkrukkis,2008-11-01T13:15Z,"Help! Its on my computer, but I can't open it in alcohol. I have the mdf and all, but alcohol says it can't recognize the file. How do I open it?"
,fullautosniper,2008-11-28T00:13Z,"My cad class uses vectorworks 11.5, but I've been having a problem opening files I make with 12.5 with 11.5. I found out how to export it to an 11 file, but they often have massive errors that make them useless. 

Is there some kind of converter program, or an otherwise better way to do that?"
,Portmanteau,2008-11-30T23:02Z,"I just like to say how much I appreciate this torrent, thank you very much.
How do I go about seeding."
,F4ND3N,2011-11-19T09:25Z,"I love this torrent. Been looking everywhere for ages for a good vectorworks torrent, and this is definately it."
,brookys,2011-11-29T21:49Z,It says it needs a dongle to work. is this right? How do we get around this.
,chrisjamesuk,2011-12-28T20:10Z,"Hey there, 

Ive downloaded the files and everything - come to install but it says I have to find a previous version to update???"
,Brian553,2012-01-26T04:04Z,"Several people said that it would be possible to use this serial to access some of the other programs in the suite. 
How do I download them or access them?  Specifically interested in Renderworks and Spotlight.....
PLEASE HELP!!!"
,whitefall,2012-02-25T13:16Z,"Thanks, it works great, i just needed to set the installed program to windows xp comptibility mode, otherwise it wouldn't run on windows 7 x64.

I used Daemon tools and the first serial."
