In this bout, junior bantamweight contender Nonito Donaire dropped down to 112 pounds to upset previously undefeated IBF flyweight titlist Vic Darchinyan by knocking the power-punching Australian out at 1:38 of the fifth round.

California's Donaire exhibited superior technique and footwork from the onset of the bout and caught the aggressive lunging champ with a perfect left hook a minute into the fifth round. Australia's Darchinyan was immediately dropped with the punch, and though he barely made it to his feet before the referee's "ten count" he stumbled into the ropes where his corner rescued him and the ref wisely waved the contest off.

Donaire improved to 18-1 (11). Darchinyan dropped to 28-1 (22).
