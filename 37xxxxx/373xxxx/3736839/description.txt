Amanda Plummer ravages through this film like a wounded hyena starving for what may be it\'s last meal come flood or high water. She may be Hollywoods best actress, but does she give a crap. I thinks not. Hollywood gives Oscars for cute models who show a talent for walking talking and chewing gum all at he same time. And if she can make herself ugly for a role, Hollywood seems astounded at her courage. Plummer can not only chew these little girls into so many wads of Jamaican licorice stick, but in this role as Eunice, she makes Robert DeNiro look like a neutered cub scout. This is as powerful a performance as you\'ll see. And on top of that her English accent is superb. There aren\'t any other actresses in Hollywood that could play this role. Maybe Renee Zellweger could come close. But I doubt she\'d have the guts to do it. This is a very disturbing film. But a performance like this would make even the great Kim Stanley cringe.
