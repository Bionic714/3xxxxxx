Thank you very much, was my most wanted!"

,phd,2007-07-08T16:06Z,"Bedankt R...

Ik hoop dat deze torrent lang genoeg blijft staan zodat FS G geheel kan worden gedownload. Een vorige torrent bleef lange tijd steken rond 80%.
Gezien je reputatie zal er wel  geen probleem zijn.
Thanx "

,Husky42,2007-12-27T11:12Z,"BE AWARE:

What 4X-AXG does is like Fairlight stealing something from Razor or Deviance.

This would not happen within groups, it is about competition. All 4X-AXG has managed to do was alienate himself as a non team player and thief.

This would not have been accepted years ago. A child to the game 4X-AXG will continue to steal. But be aware, he has never released a file that was not released elsewhere first.

He has never purchased and sold, or donated to help a cause. He is the lowest of the lowest when it comes to file sharers and in no way deserves any form of respect. He does not even know how to give appropriate credit.

4X-AXG you are nothing more then a pathetic fucking thief."

//I have put dvd 2 and 3 in the folder dvd1. and
//everything seems to work, but hven the dvd 2 //installing i got this message: Error location fs //x directory, Help. anybody know???

I got the message ""I cannot find [the folder where the folder with files from DVD lies]/FS"". The problem was solved by moving the folder with files from DVD to root and renaming it to ""FS"". 

In brief: AVOID long names and long ways, as well as non-Latin characters in the way to the folder."

1. Install FSX (make sure you have atleast 15gb left)
2. download all 3 DVD
3. Copy DVD image from DVD 2 and 3 to DVD 1 forlder
4. Start install and when asked to change DVD just press ""OK"" and it will continue without you doing anything else."
