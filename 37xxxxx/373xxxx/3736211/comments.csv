This one's for you, Mike, you douche bag."

,kirjutama,2008-05-24T04:53Z,"Why do people waste time uploading shitty rips?  128?  Dude, it's 2008.   Is it really that hard to maybe, you know, put the settings at 192+?  As well, it's kind of nice when the song titles come up properly.   "

,BadboyJay55,2011-11-26T22:42Z,I rather have a song at 128 than to not have it at all. Thanks.
