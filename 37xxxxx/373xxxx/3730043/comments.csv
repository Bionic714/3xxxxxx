,spackattack,2007-07-01T23:54Z,be nice if you seeded it !!
,yellow_snow,2007-07-02T06:29Z,"Hmmm, pretty dumb.  Post but no seed."
,kajlin,2007-09-23T03:51Z,"WOW this is pathetic

First off, ""Lucifer"" is the roman god of the sun, which was worshipped long b4 the modern day god.

Second, ""Satan"" is just hebrew for the word ""enemy"", not the devil

Third, hell is just a word for volcano, i cant remember the origin but w/e

fourth, if u believe in heaven, hell, god, or the devil, you should be ashamed at yourself for being so stupid. The thought of an afterlife is rediculous, if there wasnt this train of thought there wouldnt be suicide bombers. and alot of good people would still have there lives to look forward to. The main reason the world is such a dangerous place is because of the belief in god. and the thought that after you die you go to heaven.

I love how christians, and jews can put such a spin on reality. The fact is that after your dead your dead, your life ends, the only after life for you is when ppl talk about you after your gone.

other than that this sounds realy lame, so im not dling it, and even if i did, 1 seed? i mean common."
,Binary-Data,2007-10-07T23:21Z,"ok, the game isnt all that great, but it was an interesting concept. Kajlin, where the hell are you getting your facts? Roman god of the sun (when they were actually referring to the sun) was ""Sol"".
The word ""satan"" is not directly translated into ""enemy"", it was DERIVED from ""Adversary"".
The word ""Hell"" is in no way volcano, it has been translated as ""Sheol"", ""Gehenna"", ""Hades"", ""Tartarus"", ""Abbadon"", and ""Infernus"". None of which mean 'Volcano'.
Some people have put a spin on religion (such as you), for instance, where in the bible does it say ""If you go kill people, you will go to heaven""? it doesn't. If you were to research a single thing that came out of your mouth, you wouldn't be getting proven wrong on every point you made.
There ARE certain sects of people that DO kill people and try to use religion as a reason, but there are also people who dont use a religion as a cover. It's called 'Denial of responsibility'. It's in human nature to kill, not christian teachings.
hope you learned something
God Bless"
