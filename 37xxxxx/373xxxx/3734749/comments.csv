,GrimReaper85,2007-07-15T20:27Z,"ajs87: Open that file with a bittorrent client like for example bittornado and then you can start downloading the movie. 

Link to torrent client (Bittornado): http://bittornado.com/download.html"
,whoruchittin,2007-07-17T17:18Z,"I have found that even people who are torrent deprived can now download them and open them with PANDO an simple tool they use for large email attachments too. IT will not create torrents and it does NOT do a thing to HELP seed them. But, for you selfish people who only want to think of yourselves and never want to learn how to do anything worth while. It is a option. I have tried it and it DOES work. It takes a lot longer to open them. And I found PANDO to be sluggish But, it does work.  "

as87, that 13kb file is the entire movie with a huge compression rate! Aint that fuckin' amazing? Well it will be, in the future. For now it's just a keyfile which holds the information to stick all the downloaded splinters of a (bunch of) file(s) together on your computer so your ISP will never know what exactly you're downloading. Shhhh ;)"
