~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~LYRICS~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Warheart

[Music/Lyrics-Alexi \\\"Wildchild\\\" Laiho]

[spoken:]
From now on, we are enemies
You and I

I\\\'m an outcast on the path of rebound
Everything is frail, I desolate, crush, and burn
I have chosen darkness to be my guide
War is in my heart, death is by my side

[chorus]
Warheart! With no remains of compassion or love
Warheart! Hate your fellow as yourself

I have chosen night to be my guide
When the daylight strikes, I hide in my trench and die

[chorus]
Warheart! With no remains of compassion or love
Warheart! Hate your fellow as yourself

I\\\'m the warheart, I\\\'m dying to win the battle I live everyday
One for all and all for me, I\\\'m an animal, better set me free


2. Silent Night, Bodom Night

On the eve of their doom
they are baptized
in the unholy waters of Bodom
With no hint of the torture awaiting
to greet them at the break of dawn

When the calm is setting in
we\\\'ll watch it swiftly disappear
Too many years of silence
soon he\\\'s bound to reappear

The Reaper
is calling for you to come home
With the thrust of a switchblade
on the grip of a madman
And the waters of Bodom
turn a blood shade of red
As the Children Of Bodom
Take their last breath.

When the calm is setting in
we\\\'ll watch it swiftly disappear
Too many years of silence
soon he\\\'s bound to reappear


3. Hatebreeder

I found session, betrayed now, it\\\'s on now,
I saw, human, I see so
Well I am certain of, I don\\\'t know how,
other souls beyond this smile

I hate you from the bottom of my heart
I have no fucking right now, I see so

Beside you, I saw, (?),
other souls beyond this smile
Well I thought now, I said I saw (?),
I saw it, your vanity, your mentality, (?)

[Chorus:]
Never seen the fooled beast inside of me,
well I\\\'m an asshole, and I really will always be
So why now, oh let it be,
is that so fucking hard, oh be dead, I\\\'m free

Burn it hard, make a void that sucks to the suction drive
We need the open thing with my special little part of life

(I tell you!)

I\\\'m accessing in all the northern light,
you know I got no fucking other souls, guilty now
I\\\'ve got no fine, no fucking thoughts, so,
a combination, now you\\\'re fucking dead

[Chorus:]
Never seen the fooled beast inside of me,
well I\\\'m an asshole, and I really will always be
So why now, let it be,
is that so fucking hard, be dead, I\\\'m free


4. Bed Of Razors

I see the candle light burning in your
eyes, flaring up my eyes in flames
On this pitch-black summer night...
of passion and pain

The razor caressed my flesh
and my arms turned red, I feel a vast desire
Years of pain are flowing down my arms.
Sweet, red, warm stream you drink, make me released
Give me your hand, let me make you feel the ease,
in the bed of razors we bleed together...

I feel the fire burning in my heart,
I see it sparkling in your eyes
The blaze you\\\'re feeding more and more

The razor caressed your flesh and your arms turned red.
I feel your vast desire
Tearing pain is flowing down your arms.
Sweet, red, warm stream I drink to make you released
Holding your arms, cherish this composure,
in the bed of razors we sleep together, forever...


5. Towards Dead End

No flickering light at the end of the path
Confront repressions of the past
Fear... Prevail... Insanity... Obey!
Draw back in silence to dwell in anxiety
No matter where I am, I\\\'m alone
My dreams are shattered
into thousand running tears
The tears keep dripping down, down,
deep, down from my veins

I\\\'m walking towards dead end I\\\'m walking all alone
Two steps behind insanity
There\\\'s no starlight guiding my way through this downward death row
Soon will be the time I have to go...

Little by little the end is drawing near
Another night and so little blood to spare
(Ya can hurt me... but ya can\\\'t possess me \\\'Y know...)

Kill me, hurt me, fuck me, rape me, you won\\\'t have me!

Draw back in silence to dwell in anxiety,
No matter where I am, I\\\'m alone. I\\\'m crying out loud
the tears of blood I bleed, so fuck the world,
I\\\'ll go now, I don\\\'t care. (Who cares?)

I\\\'m walking towards dead end, and I\\\'m walking all alone
Two steps ago I past insanity
There\\\'s no starlight guiding my way out this downward death row
So now is the time I have to go


6. Black Widow

(Right!)

(Fire!) the fire is more right than my eyes
Don\\\'t remain, go misplay, you\\\'re so, so wild
(Traitor!) your vengeance night, yes, always for me
Always now, once you know, widow

(Right!)

(Murder!) your fire murders all my problems
Ah (oh yeah!)

[Chorus:]
Fire: here I see the fire in my heart
Traitor: hate your face, obey or you\\\'re gonna die
Murder: murderer in you call me to die
Oh yeah: I\\\'ll come back to you when I\\\'m dead

Your voice is getting closer (today: fuck every day!)

Sleep up in the night - the Lord doesn\\\'t matter in my fight
Widow, tell me the reason

[Chorus:]
Fire: fire is into turning in my heart
Traitor: hate your face, obey or you\\\'re gonna die
Murder: praying on my knee, I saw her near, come here
Oh yeah: I\\\'ll come back to you when I\\\'m dead

I\\\'m dead: this is all, widow


7. Wrath Within

Once I desire, eternity has come
pull back, the tale is black, all we have to die
You say so, I am invading vision - satisfy

Once I look back, so miracle
on a crib with the night
Sensation, call me to die

Look down, we have to sow and all waits to say go
Once I desire, be back to hear this cry: let me out

(And I am the first one, any want to die!?)

[Chorus:]
With my salvation within your pain
you gotta develop pain into your desires
What it always about: you raise your pain
why you can\\\'t desire your cold regained?
Come on, get down

I touch your legs, so cold, make me cold in the light,
and I burn now, no pain
Your pain seems so far away,
so everything that\\\'s cold in light may die down

[Chorus:]
You raise your pain and I kill your strain,
anyway, I get into your desires my way
I crave your pain;
I can\\\'t swallow your pain: why you returned


8. Children Of Bodom

In the silence of darkness, among the shadows of the dead we hear
a wolf howling hungry to wake up children of the graves
Unripe Vengeance! The cult that serves as revenge
has put forward it\\\'s fangs to declare a fucking WAR!

Only calmless spirits of corpses are passing by the altars of Bodom
where everything but death is a lie
To spill your blood to become our wine
We\\\'ll reborn really where only the wild will survive

The clash of wickedness veils Lake Bodom blood red
We have gathered our souls to praise the triumph of Death

Children of Bodom
angry are rising
Running amok, slaying
with a sense of desire
From the twilight of the past,
among the victims who died

Something Wild
has survived!


9. Downfall

The night of timeless fire is drawing near
I flee... Throughout the years of throe
Watching through a mirror, as I fall apart
I see a wreck, I\\\'m burning

I see angels burning, falling down in ruins
Looking down I see me, I\\\'m my own enemy

Watching myself decaying, falling from high spirits
I flee... Throughout the ruins of me
Longing for finding my way out
Leaving myself, there\\\'s nothing left for me
The ruins are about to crumble down.

The flame is dying by shivery winds of jet black skies
It reflects hatred in my eyes

I see angels burning, falling down in ruins
Looking down I see my ashes scattered around my grave

Angels whispering fire, no longer I\\\'m alive
Settled down I\\\'m done with the trip to my kingdom come
