how do I fix it? :("
,jabmano,2008-03-08T17:58Z,"Guys, just right click the first rar and hit extract here. It will extract and combine everything. Then you can use daemon tools to mount the cue/bin file combination."
[T],spotswood,2008-03-19T12:33Z,"firestarter i concur, soyo you're a total moron!!! not because he's inexperienced when it comes to rar's uploaded for games, but by the fact he assumed it shouldn't be downloaded ""for whatever reasons""... "

For anyone asking on how to install, download winrar from rarlab.com and extract what's inside."

,FR0GSTAR,2011-03-16T21:50Z,"O torrent funciona perfeitamente. E Penumbra: Overture Ã© um jogo sensacional! Se vocÃª procura uma experiÃªncia de jogo realmente marcante, pode baixar tranquilamente, porque nÃ£o vai se arrepender!

Obs: Ã‰ sÃ³ usar o PowerISO ou o Daemon Tools pra emular a imagem do jogo e instalar.

The torrent works perfectly. I recommend it!"
