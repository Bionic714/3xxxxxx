cmdow.exe only keeps the install screen on the top while installing halo 2.
But none of the loaders works for me. :(
Anybody can help?
The Halo2 installer appears, then I click on Customize...
The customize window appears, i select folder, the select full install only, do not run.
Then a window appears that my video driver may be out of date (I downloaded it 3 weeks ago :P). So I click ""Run"" then all window disappear, (except the ""Waiting for install to complete...""), and then nothing happens (I have waited for almost 30 minutes). And yes, I've tried to install to the default directory, too. Any idea? I think I will try the preinstalled RIPPED version from DOPEMAN.
