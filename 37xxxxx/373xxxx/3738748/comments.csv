,edman45,2008-07-25T17:11Z,When I play this with MS Media Player the audio is in Spanish. How do I get the English audio? 
,jmg999,2009-02-04T08:42Z,There's no clear indication on how to play the English audio. When you play the DVD the menu gives you a choice of either Castellano or Portuguese. Please explain how to play this DVD in English. Thank you.
,torgman1,2009-02-17T04:40Z,"jmg999: select any language.  For Castellano (aka, Spanish), pick ""seleccion de audio y subtitulos"" then pick ""ingles.""  For Portuguese, pick ""configuacao"", then pick ""ingles.""  If you play this in WMP, right click on the movie while it plays and you can select a language there.

Now, can someone tell me how to get this to fit on a whole DVD-R or how to get it so it will play on another computer and my DVD player?  My Nero won't let me do it."

Convert to mpeg2 format using Any Video Converter. Burn this mpg file onto a DVD-R disk (avoid DVD+R) using DVD Flick. Do not use computer during the conversion & burn process as these are sensitive and may result in A/V async. The resultant DVD-R will play on any legacy standalone players, cars and TVs.

I have tried and it works like a charm."
