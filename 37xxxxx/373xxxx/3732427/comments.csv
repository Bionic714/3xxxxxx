,kandak,2008-06-07T14:55Z,"awesome torrent.  Songs work great, but thought I would mention St. Elmo's Fire, Take These Broken Wings, I Just Died in Your Arms Tonight, and I Wish It Would Rain are definitely not by Mike + the Mechanics.

St. Elmo's Fire - John Parr
Broken Wings - Mr. Mister
I Just Died in Your Arms Tonight - The Cutting Crew
I Wish it Would Rain Down - Phil Collins"
