Episode Info is taken from (and will continue to be taken from) Tvrage.com

http://www.tvrage.com/Ghost_Hunters

Scifi Ghost hunters site doesn't list last October's special as an episode. This is probably where the difference comes from."
,Scorpwanna,2007-07-19T08:51Z,"Oh I was wondering where the +1 episode numbering was coming from. Scifi.com calls this episode ""311"" as well as it's production code number. Yes the Live Stanley Hotel Halloween special isn't considered an episode.

Hrm that website does have the episodes in order but neglects the true numbering of the episodes."
