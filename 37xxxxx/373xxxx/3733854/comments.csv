,8icecola6,2008-01-30T15:41Z,"I don´t know what im doing wrong. I extract all from the rar file but it gives me only 11 files. XIII_CD4.mds and the xiii_v1.3_codegame.exe are missing. Then i installed the game using mdf files (tried with mds too). I overwrite XIII.ini file. Then i started the game and after the ""You are feeling faint"" text game crashes. It says something like this. ""engine error, copyCd?"". if anyone can give me answers it would be great. Thanks."

,Hom3Skill3t,2009-01-24T22:50Z,"If you guys like the game check out the miniseries, fore-warning i thought the ending kinda sucked, but overall it was pretty good. If the link doesn't work, it should be in the top 100 still under movies.

,har42,2009-02-09T22:05Z,"I have the same problem as lithfffs any advice would greatly be recived i have tried PowerISO, Alcohol 120% and Deamon Tools all result in the same outcome : 

Install disc works fine but during disc2 its says ""delete all configuration and saved games files? (answering yes will delete the XIII install folder and all its contents)"", no matter do i choose yes or no it removes installed files "
,riplikethat,2009-04-24T07:40Z,"Same problem as everyone else.

Installation cancels when you use Disc 2 and uninstalls the installed files instead (the delete Savegames option)."
,riplikethat,2009-04-28T03:51Z,"I found a way to install it under Vista X64. Game runs fine after installation and yes, game rocks.

I recommend viewing the XIII movie as well, it's pretty good action flick."
,SamFisher440,2009-05-04T18:12Z,"Installed fine. I think I found the solution. Create 4 virtual drives and mount an image to each of them. Start the install from the autorun menu and when it asks for the next disk, browse for it on the drive you mounted it to. "
,SamFisher440,2009-05-04T18:33Z,Copied the No Cd and ran the v1.3 Safedisc and it works. Thanks so much!
,SageNarutoKun,2009-06-03T23:50Z,"Hello everyone,
I have a problem, when i play it right at the beginning it show me a message sayin int error cd copy? what is that? Please, help me"
,Meadows_zeta,2009-07-04T13:37Z,"@riplikethat:
So why didn't you share the solution?
That's not how a gentleman operates."
,vreker,2009-08-19T22:18Z,"download it and installed in fine,

but nog i have a problem in game, 
in the sencuary lvl, i think i have to push a tombstone, center is a circle with 4 one's in the middle, dont know what to do, im stuck"
,Progamergaming,2010-11-28T08:32Z,"Yerp, same problem as har42 and lithfffs and probably everyone else here. Installation mounts and installs fine, half way through disc 2, ""Delete all configuration and saved games files? (answering yes will delete the XIII install folder and all its contents)"" and choosing yes or no makes no difference. 

I've tried SamFisher440's solution and it still does the same thing. Someone please come up with something that works, please? This game is awesome."
,guitarvids,2010-12-02T17:19Z,"I found the solution to the game uninstalling after disk 2!!! !!! !!!
I found it here:

Ok here are the instructions.  I followed them exactly how they are and it worked perfectly.  I installed on Windows 7 64 bit.  Hope this works out for you as it did for all my friends!
----------
Installing XIII in Windows Vista or Windows 7.....
....."
,guitarvids,2010-12-02T17:21Z,"... ...
... This is how I managed to install XIII on Windows Vista or 7 (64 bit). The problem I had was that the setup program started to uninstall XIII after I put in CD 2 (asking Do you want to keep your saved games?). This most likely has to do with the copy protection which the game uses. Patch 1.3 removes CD checks from the game (but not from the installer, of course).

1. Create a directory XIII on your hard drive. Copy each of the CD's into it's own directory within the XIII directory so that the contents of CD1 is in XIII\CD1.
2. Open up the task manager (press Ctrl+Alt+Del), it will be used later. Choose the tab Processes.
3. Right-click on the file setup.exe in the directory XIII\CD1 and choose Properties. Select the tab Compatibility, check the box to run the program in compatibility mode and from the drop-down box, choose to run the program in compatibility mode for Windows 98/ME.
4. Run setup.exe (which you just set the compatibility mode for). Keep an eye on the process setup.exe (alternatively named setup.exe *32 or similar) in the task manager. If a lot of these processes pop up, rename setup.exe to something else temporarily (keep the processes running in the meantime), that should stop the process from respawning.
5. The setup will now launch and you can proceed as normal.
6. If the setup program asks for the location of setup.exe, rename the file which you renamed in step 4 back to setup.exe and continue.
7. The setup will now proceed normally.
8. When the installation is complete, you can remove the XIII folder, including the folders to which you copied the contents of the CD's to, from your hard drive.
9. Install any patches (you will probably at least want to install the 1.3 patch INCLUDED IN THIS TORRENT).
10. Play!"
,guitarvids,2010-12-02T17:24Z,"If the setup still won't work, try closing down any programs which you have running and then try again. Alternatively, if you have any CD drive emulators, such as Daemon Tools or Alcohol 52%, you may want to temporarily uninstall these.

----------
The first couple of times I tried it, it wasn't working but I found that when I was renaming the setup.exe file I called it setupx.exe to stop setup32.exe respawning multiple times in task manager and the installer not opening up (after you rename the setup.exe it will open up) I had to go in and change the compatibility options as it was turning them off after the file was renamed after that it worked perfectly

Hope that all makes sense

You can also get the latest official and unofficial patches from here:

PS:  Online multiplayer WORKS perfectly...   Just make an account on UBI.com and log on the game multiplayer with your account and IT WORKS...  No crack, no patch, no keygen, no nothing!
Hope to see you all online!"
,gene_genie,2011-08-08T02:11Z,"Guitarvids' method worked for me. Sadly, the game didn't. In the very first chapter, on the beach, after the yacht scene, the baywatch girl just stays there and waves her hand at the helicopter, over and over again (even after the chopper's gone). Nothing happens, I can't reach the truck (I'm supposed to faint before that), can't do nothing. That's too bad. "
