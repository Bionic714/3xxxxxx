,lanc545,2007-07-11T03:19Z,"Although I'm an Fs9 user thanks for the upload.
What's happened to all the aero pirates we used to have?

Thx"
,PJ-PH,2007-07-11T03:28Z,"Thnx for this one 4X, 

If anyone is using the Sky simulations MD-11 , can you help me with the SP2  ?? , I really need that SP2 badly , so how can i get this??   Please help.."
,ashsimmonds4,2007-07-11T18:50Z,Thank you 4x :)
,troppo1,2007-07-11T21:53Z,"Bit hard to find something that you havent already got or shared.
Thanks for this one also. I wont req Vancouver + for FSX then will I.
Thanks again"
,4X-AXG,2007-07-11T22:10Z,"I don't mean specifically sharing something I don't have yet, I mean sharing in general. People should take in account some 'ground rules' here, or at least consider them:

1. be happy with what you have, instead of whining about what you don't have

2. people who share a lot, get a lot. if some of the regular sharers around here has a specific request, I'll be happy to upload it for him. if somebody, who has ZERO shares requests shit..too bad. the more you ask for it, the least I'm willing to upload it.

3. FLY!!!! I can't help but get the feeling that some flightsim guys are on the PB 12 hours a day instead of 1 hour PB and 11 hours flying! just downloading add-ons without actually using them is pretty..well..useless

4. oh and IF you decide to request shit..at LEAST say thank you and then request something..just leaving request messages at a post is the very worst thing a los..eh..leecher can do"
,PJ-PH,2007-07-12T02:55Z,"I'm sorry X , i don't have that much space left on mi drive so i have to delete the download file to save some room , trust me i fly at least  35 ours a week (10 ours actually sitting behind my pc ) but i really love what you do , so please don't hate on me
.. if you could tell me how i could otherwise crack a sky sim md-11 SP2 i'would do it myself , but i was counting on one of you guys to up the sp , but thnx anyway X , holla , don't hate dude"
,claudeduhavre,2007-07-12T15:18Z,perfect really for fsx !
,eNuffSaid,2007-07-12T23:57Z,"Thank you again Mr. 4X-AXG. You are very right about ppl requesting stuff. I'm guilty of doing so myself. But at least I had the decency to thank you for your upload. Sometimes the comments look more like a request board. Really embarresing for the uploader. Sorry you have to take that kind of sh1t3. I certainly won't do it again.

Thank you for all your wonderful uploads here at TPB.

Cheers,

,Capt.Jambo,2007-07-13T01:21Z,"Hi all,

Thanx for this great peace of software. 
I have installed it and that went well, but when aircraft is loaded the gauges don't seem to work, and the same thing happens with ""Wilco Publishing - The Modern Airliner Collection - Airbus Series Volume 1 - Deluxe Edition"" which is from same developer and publisher and posted here by 4X-AXG, who by the way has brought to us many goods, or at least the best!
Does anyone know why the software doesn't recognize the gauges? 

Thanx"
,Zetlander,2007-07-13T08:13Z,Thanks very much for this... had purchased it for FS9 and thought it was great. Had considered buying again for FSX but thanks to you don't need to for now. Nice one!
,4X-AXG,2007-07-13T21:04Z,"enuff: thanks for that..a request once in a while is okay, but some guys really push it..but do not be afraid to ask for a certain add-on sometimes, especially since PMs are not possible anymore

jambo: the gauges of both the 737 and A320 work just fine. in the A320's case, just move your mouse cursor on the display and turn the wheel knob on your mouse. please read the manual before saying the gauges do not work"
,Capt.Jambo,2007-07-15T18:02Z,"Thanx for the info 4x-AXG

Who told you I didn't read the manual? In fact I read it, by the way you said it seems like it is usual to me coming here asking question that can be answered on the manual! Not only I read the manual top to bottom, I read too all post concerning the torrent in case anyone had the same problem! It looks like this time I missed that info, I'm sorry if my english isn't so good and some things I don't understand, maybe that's why I missed it!
And when I said that the gauges don't work I meant for ME...it doesn't mean that the aircraft is nuked or anything like that, in fact, I only asked because the PMDG 747-F one has to register the gauges, and I just thought this was the same case.
Once again THANX for everything "

,Havok_,2007-07-15T21:40Z,"4x, all of your files work perfectly bro, you are the man!! I'm going through all of your uploads one by one THANK YOU!!"
,4X-AXG,2007-07-16T16:21Z,"Jambo, unfortunately it is VERY common for people not to read the manual and then bitch here about crashes, CTDs and non working gauges. you say you read the manual, but if that is true, you would have read that you have to turn up the brightness of the gauges by placing your mouse cursor on top of them and turning the mouse wheel knob..so next time, read better ;-)"
,vfast007,2007-07-18T11:20Z,Firstly 4X-AXG - a big thanks for this torrent. YOU DA MAN. Second - can anyone confirm that I should have a virtual cockpit? In game I only have the runway in Virtual Cockput view.
,flyingdutchman83,2007-07-27T20:52Z,"Hi guys!

Thanks for this great product for FSX!! I've got it for FS9 and was waiting until it was available for FSX. But after installing Service Pack 1 and PIC737 i've got the same problem as Jambo have/had: The gauges don't work. It's not only the fact that the screens are dark, none of the knobs works. The only thing i can do is fly the aircraft , with a dark cockpit. Anyone who can solve this problem? Thanks!

,shaffster,2007-08-06T18:18Z,"perfect. i find it good, the guages etc doesnt work due to the fact that you need to get update from wilco. aslo, you can get about 40 different top class textures aswel. 

www.wilcopub.com

in the navigation choose extra, then B737 PIC and youll see them. 

for the update go to support, then B737 PIC and youll see the update

I was wondering if anyone could help me out.. The planes work fine except the textures, I can't see any textures on any of the planes, the whole plane is just white. Installing liverys doesn't help either, no matter witch one I chose the plane just turns out white. The 2d cockpit is fine, but the in VC and outside the plane I can't see any textures :/

I'm runneing Vista x64 and have installed the Vista update to the 737PIC.

Thanks :)

,Settled,2008-06-01T12:27Z,"This Addon is not working. yes you get the airplane into your fsx and blabla but for example, the engins cannot be started, atleast not for me and yes iam not a rookie in the game. You cant scroll out in the cockpit so much so you cant push the buttoms which makes the fealing unreal. the gauges is not working either(neither with scrolling on them) 4X-AXG u are really cool and its so nice that u publish these things but its always bugs.. its ALways something wrong, would be awesome with 1 download that could match the one u buyes. Its gauges or its views or as now unstartable, its always something wrong and this is what makes atleast me considering the option to buy the producuts instead, just wanted to add this. for me this addon does NOT WORK. feel free to flame, also, bough my traffic and Airbus volume series 2 so gonna share that up people, PAyware Edition."
