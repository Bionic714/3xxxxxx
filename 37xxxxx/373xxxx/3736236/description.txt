With Tsunade still paralized with fear and Naruto being a low level ninja, it is up to Shizune and Jiraiya to defeat Kabuto and Orochimaru. Orochimaru and Kabuto summon two giant snakes while Jiraiya summons Gamakichi, who does nothing. Naruto tries to help Jiraya, but he too only summons a small frog that also does nothing. Orochimaru and Kabuto attack and Shizune is easily defeated. Naruto tries Rasengan but fails. Can he master the technique before Kabuto does anything to Tsunade? How far will he go to master it?
