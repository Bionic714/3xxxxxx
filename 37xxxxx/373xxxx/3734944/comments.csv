I didn't even know there had been a Director's cut for this excellent movie!!!!!

WE NEED SEEDZ!!!! ;-) Please..."
,seven0fnine,2008-11-02T20:23Z,"I'm pretty sure that you have seen the Director's Cut of Phenomena. What you probably haven't seen is the heavily cut 82 minute variant. The DC is what most people have seen. You can find this out easily by checking if you remember seeing all of the scenes described here :

In short, if you remember the 'babyfood' and 'thumbs & handcuffs' scenes, then you have seen the DC. 

In regards to this, I would welcome anyone to upload a torrent of Phenomena (Creepers) in DVD quality. And not the cut version, please ;)"
