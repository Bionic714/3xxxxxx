,Porkster,2007-11-26T12:41Z,hmm this isn't a pro-Israel or Pharisee-Christian the thing?  Nothing worse than Christians for Israel cause.  Talk about deceived if so.
[T],TalmudTimmy,2008-09-24T16:52Z,Jews are not God's chosen people. Chuck Missler is a smart man when it comes to science but a complete propagandist when it comes to Biblical prophecy.

could you develop that? 
i wanna hear what you have to say. "
[T],TalmudTimmy,2010-03-28T03:12Z,"Fan, Missler teaches a modern heresy that Jews are saved by race, not Grace and that 1948 establishing of Israel was fulfillment of Bible prophecy. This rings of another false prophet, Hal Lindsey, who predicted the rapture 3 times and they never came to fruition.

Missler is at worst an ignoramus, at best an counter intelligence operative."
