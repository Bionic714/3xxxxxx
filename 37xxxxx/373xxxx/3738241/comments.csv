,trikky,2007-08-18T07:23Z,"320kb/s, good quality.  However, some of the tracks are incorrectly titled.  For example, BIG HOTEL is actually BOY WONDER and BREAKAWAY is TIN DRUM.

I don't know what other tracks are messed up (although I DO know that the 12"" mixes of Breakaway and Hungry Town"" are what they say they are.

Overall though, thanks for seeding this high quallity collection."
