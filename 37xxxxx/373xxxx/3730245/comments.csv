can you do something chippermonky please? "
,chippermonky,2007-07-05T10:17Z,"OOPS, I accidentally changed the files after uploading this. I'm a moron. If you are stuck an 99.8, just go ahead and run the program. It'll work, it'll just regenerate the config files which have been changed."
,spackattack,2007-07-06T16:51Z,same dude ffs omg seed 99.8 you are the only one with this file seed 
,onemicmike,2007-09-03T05:06Z,"Thanks for uploading this! This works very well, especially SFIII third strike. As for the sf33usa.bin file, you can find it in google (i used the mediafire one). "
,onemicmike,2007-09-04T12:53Z,"BTW, can anyone tell me how to configure apunch x3 and kick x3 button in this emulator? I can't seem to figure it out and it's a pain to press them all at once on my ps2 controller"
