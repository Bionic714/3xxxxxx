Well, here ya go. All 52 episodes from Red Dwarf's 8 seasons. I just got a Zune and after a few frustrating days I finally figured out a good formula for converting video files. These are all in WMV format and are ready to be sync'd up with your zune, no extra conversion needed! They range from about 100-130 MB each, and they look great on my Zune. I'll post the technical details and some caps below. Enjoy!
