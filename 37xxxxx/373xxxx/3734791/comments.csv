,iamfanboytoo,2007-09-10T11:48Z,"Ugh. Whoever edited the seasons 5-8 is a TOTAL FUCKING SMEGHEAD, and I don't mean that in a nice way. In every episode, half a scene is clipped out that's actually necessary to the plot, and sometimes the funniest jokes are bloody well GONE. 2 minutes gone from each episode. I compared them to other, better versions I'd had since the days of KaZaA. 

I don't know where this guy got the eps, and at first I was grateful, and I was already going to shell for the DVDs as soon as possible, but still... man, the eps feel crippled. "
