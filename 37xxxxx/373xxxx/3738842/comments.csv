There's the original english track and english subs...
So why so abusive? You seem to know a little english at least... and downloading is free."
,Bilgeis,2007-07-12T19:24Z,"Well in Spain we use to buy movies with Spanish audio. They always have original English soundtrack and some other subtitles in several languages, but I can't upload a film with Dutch subtitles if they aren't in the original DVD.
Why don't you try to go to a Dutch market and buy an original DVD. It's more expensive than download from here but I'm sure that it will have Dutch subtitles.
Then, you could upload here too..."
