,krutok,2007-07-08T10:56Z,I am stuck at 35.2 %!!
,krutok,2007-07-08T10:56Z,Perhaps u can pm me and we can exchange some yoga videos?
,rh128592,2007-07-09T22:45Z,"It's close... over 90% uploaded.

People have been great about seeding this once it's up, so as soon as I get it out there you'll be good to go.

Krutok: Thanks for the offer.  I don't have anything left to offer.  If they're no good, I get rid of them.  If they're good, I put them in the compilation."
,rh128592,2007-07-11T01:48Z,"I just discovered ""super seeding"".  I'm going to try it out.  It seems like everyone is stuck at 56% which is a drag.  Hopefully this will help get more seeders."
,krutok,2007-07-11T14:39Z,rh128592: You don't have to offer anything. If you like you can simply get whatever I have. I've searched most of the download networks recently and taken down most of what they had. I mean you have already offered me enough with your mook&bee dvd part 1 and soon part 2. =) Thank you!
,krutok,2007-07-11T14:40Z,"I just saw speeds of 500 kb/s, and now it is down to 50 again =( "
,rh128592,2007-07-14T14:23Z,">can u upload them as divx with 700 mb? 

I hear what you're saying.  What I was specifically going for was a DVD you could take away from the computer, wherever you do your Yoga-thing, and get going without negotiating all the DVD ""fluff"".

That said, I know aXXo is a master at compressing DVDs to 700mb so maybe I should give it a shot.

Thanks for the idea,"
