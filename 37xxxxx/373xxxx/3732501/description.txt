Like the first DVD, we've collected a few Yoga workouts which are fairly good, cut out all the splash screens, disclaimers, and 8 minute "Why Yoga is Good For You" intros, and just made it quick and easy.  Here's what we put on this one:



Video 1-2: Yoga Zone: Stretching for Flexibility

Video 3:Ana Caban Pilates Abs

Video 4-6: Power Yoga Strength Flexibility 
http://rodneyyeeyogastore.com/120-1314.html



EDITORIAL:
The intro menu has an 8-minute long relaxation audio track for your cool down, plus lots of gratuitous animation (We won't make that mistake again- it adds too much to the overall size).

The Pilates video- Okay, not Yoga but the woman in green is buff and it's a damn good workout.  Ad hand weights or a medicine ball when it gets easy.

The Rodney Yee strength video gets into some of those funky cool positions the beginner DVDs never touch.  That said, it very Vinyasa-based so get prepared for forward bend/plank/downdog combo ad-nauseum.

The Yoga Zones are okay.  Nice when you need a decent 20-minute session, but you won't tell your friends about it.

Overall these videos aren?t quite as good as our first compilation (I'm exhausting my available resources), but since I secretly desire Sarah Ivanhoe (don?t tell Mook!) there?s some bias there.



Have fun!

PS: Since the "this has a virus" comment is all the rage on Pirate Bay, let me assure you, with every well-stretched cell in my body, that I don't even know where to find a virus let alone how to attach it to a DVD ISO.  Furthermore, I run anti-virus and firewalls so there's little chance anything hopped on for the ride.  The project was compiled with NERO and converted to ISO with CD Burner XP.
