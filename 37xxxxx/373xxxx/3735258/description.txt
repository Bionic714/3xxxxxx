In the same vein as Animalympics, Willy Fog is a lion that stars in animated 
adaptations of Jules Verne's more famous works. Willy Fog is accompanied by a host 
of other animated animals in cartoons that loosely are based on these stories:

"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"
"Around the World in 80 Days"
"Journey to the Center of the Earth"

Created by the same studio that produced Sandokan, another furry animated adventure.
