After a two-year break for the series, Codemasters Studios' designers have
created a reinvigorated McRae experience. The new Colin McRae title goes
beyond the series' point-to-point rallying to deliver the most diverse
selection of extreme off-road competitions. Sensational gravel, mud and
dirt racing events from the world over include perilous Hill Climb and
collision-packed Rally Cross events. International rallying competitions
are also featured, with official cars on tracks based on real roads and
locations around the globe. The title also expands on beat-the-clock
racing and includes events with multiple cars on track to satisfy anyone
who wants to push their on-the-edge driving just that bit further.
