Rubin and Ed (1991) starring Crispin Glover and Howard Hessman.

VCR to DVD.  From what I was told by a local video store owner, this movie will never be released on DVD because a few people in the cast refuse to sign away the rights.

I'm not sure why or what the specifics are.

In any case, this is a DVD, including a crude menu (thanks to Demonoid for the original torrent).

I didn't create this rip or the menu.  I'm a huge fan of this movie and want to make it available to anyone who is interested.
