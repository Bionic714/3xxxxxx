,Minarelli,2007-07-06T07:00Z,Why upload a torrent without seeding it at least to the level where others can continue...? Beats me!
,MM2007,2007-07-22T03:19Z,Sorry about that.  Something got hosed with the torrent.  I'll try again when I have more time.  My apologies.
,yongmuller,2007-09-20T07:29Z,can I get a seed?
,fdiyen,2008-01-30T00:53Z,seed please this is a great movie
,MM2007,2008-03-16T14:53Z,"I'll be seeding for as long as I can.  Sorry it took so long.

PPR!"
,miggzz,2008-10-29T18:37Z,"This Movie reminds me of my life.
I would say 9 out of 10 quality and same for the sound.
The reason why it is 9 out of 10 is because this is an old school movie.
...
When I went to create chapters using Nero 7 it said that it had existing chapters, so I went ahead and let it burn; however, when it got done it didn't have chapters in place just one long run with no chapters, so create chapter when burning this.
Highest regards MM2007 you do a good service to all of us that have an appreciation for old school movies, especially considering the fact that they aren't making this on DVD. If they made this movie on DVD I would have bought it.
...I will seed, I hope you do the same."
,miggzz,2008-10-29T18:39Z,"One other thing. When I went to play this on my computer it ran really slow like it didn't burn correctly. __The Movie did run good when I went and put it in my DVD player. 
Also it usually take my DVD burner 2 hours to burn but this only took about 25 minutes.
Thanks again."

,LRQ,2009-03-08T15:40Z,"Btw, the DVD was VHS quality, not quite as dark as this torrent."
