Marton Bukovi, nicknamed "Marci bacsi" - "Uncle Marton", (December 10, 1903 - February 11, 1985) was a Hungarian football (soccer) manager who was instrumental in the development of the 4-2-4 football formation. While at the club VÃ¶rÃ¶s LobogÃ³ he modified the WM formation to a WW, which was later used by fellow countryman GusztÃ¡v Sebes in the successful Hungarian national team of the early 1950s. This was later refined to produce the 4-2-4 formation and adopted by successful teams, including the Brazilian national team that won the 1958 FIFA World Cup.
During his club-career Bukovi coached GraÄ?anski Zagreb (1935-45), Dinamo Zagreb (1945-47), MTK (VÃ¶rÃ¶s LobogÃ³) (1947-54), Ã?jpest DÃ³zsa (1955-56), MTK (1957-59), DiÃ³sgyÅ?r (1962-64) and Olympiakos (1965-67). 

At Olympiakos, Bukovi, assisted by Mihaly Lantos, won the first two Alpha Ethniki titles in the club's history. He was enormously popular  but the military regime has forced him to leave Greece cause his political believes.  He died in 1985.
