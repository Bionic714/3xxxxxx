But there was a copy in a another store of the same video-rental-chain in the other side of town. So I took my car and went there. Only to be told that that copy was reserved for another customer. 

This leads me to the conclution that P2P-file-sharing is more effective than traditional video-stores and that video stores are not in the movie or music business, but in the logistics and transportation business. Since this is much better carried out on the internet, even if video films and music were totaly free aviable at no cost in regular stores, people would still not go there, but instead keep on loading stuff from the interhet and p2p networks.

,CSuk,2008-05-26T22:27Z,"Ta Muchly 4 the UL...

... However! McNamara was a MURDERING egotistical B*****D; like so many in office during his time.
Hmmm!? Nothing has changed there then. Politicians are exactly the same today."

,hannukastro,2009-07-06T17:05Z,"R.I.P.

Guys like him would be needed nowadays.  I mean the way he admitted the failure and tried to learn the lesson."
,egress63,2009-07-06T18:56Z,"How ironical and sad that I find about this person on the day he passed away. 

R.I.P McNamara... I wish I had known about you sooner."
,sillyscrewy,2009-08-09T09:44Z,"Thanks for this torrent! McNamara was a murderous sonofabitch, and his later ""regrets"" were nothing more than crocodile tears. For you silly cunts who think that McNamara was a kind old man and a hero, ask your grandparents what they thought of this butcher!"
,runcdfirst,2009-09-10T03:12Z,"McNamara.. I hope hell exists, if only so you have a place to spend eternity."
,stinkbutt,2010-03-18T17:30Z,He was what we needed at the time.
