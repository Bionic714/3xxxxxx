Candid Camera: The First Episode

NBC, Sunday, May 29, 1949, at 7:30pm  (according to DVD cover)

Allen Funt's very first Candid Camera episode, done in grainy black-and-white, with a live studio audience.

Take it for what it is: Funt's clumsy, folksy first attempt. It's not a polished performance, but it sure does evoke the nostalgia of that early TV era.
