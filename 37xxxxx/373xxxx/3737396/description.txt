This is a free comic created by Martin F. Mastrovita Viladrich. Is about a group of girls skilled in martial arts (karate, taekwondo, kick boxing, etc...). This comic is almost finished and is the first issue.
The style is the classical Japanese manga / anime style and the characters,  women and men are well designed.
In this first issue there is a fight between a woman and another woman but in the future there will be mixed fights too.
And finally this comic strip has been made in full color. :D
