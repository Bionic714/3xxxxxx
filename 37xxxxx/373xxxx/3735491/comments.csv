I hope someone seeds a real DVD version of this."
,Yoobydoo,2007-07-08T02:31Z,"Thank you very much. Maybe not the best quality, but shure it's the best we can get right now. Thank you!!"
,racvets1,2007-07-08T02:37Z,"I didn't do any editing... Turned on TiVo, hit capture on a Hardware Divx encoder, and hit stop at the end.  No post processing.  If you download it, there is a little at the beginning and end with commercials (under 3 seconds)"
,racvets1,2007-07-08T02:40Z,And I don't think a DVD exists yet because they were recorded at concerts TODAY!!!
,cosa1984,2007-07-08T03:14Z,Thanks man! And this guy who talks about DVD is a real butthole!
,cosa1984,2007-07-08T03:18Z,"And please ,keep them coming..."
,racvets1,2007-07-08T03:42Z,"Anyone have suggestions on what you want, I am a little limited on bandwidth (about 20KB/s upload), so I won't release them all at once.  Once it gets seeded by everyone, I can release another.  Also, I need to finish capturing them all.  I am a little behind right now..."
