It\'s the hidden camera game show you don\'t know you\'re on! Host Regan Burns, in disguise, chats with complete strangers and inserts 5 trivia questions. After revealing himself and the hidden camera\'s location, Burns gives the unsuspecting contestants $20 cash for each correct answer. A \"lightning round\"(as many questions as possible in 60 seconds) is also done with the $20 per correct answer payout. Scantily-clad models are frequently seen carrying a visual aid for a $100 bonus question. The first player each show is given a chance for more money by pulling Burns\' routine on someone else with Burns feeding them lines and questions through a hidden earpiece. The new player still gets $20 per correct answer but the player-turned-host gets $100 for each of the new player\'s correct answers. At commercial breaks, Burns stops some random people and asks them one question for $20.
