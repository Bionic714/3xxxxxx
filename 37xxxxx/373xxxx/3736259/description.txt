FOX News Channel presents the documentary the Public Broadcasting System didn\'t want you to see.

It\'s a film about the difference between moderate Muslims and the radicals who want to kill us. It asks where are the moderate Muslims and why aren\'t they speaking out against the jihadists? And it was financed with $675,000 of taxpayers\' money.

It was commissioned as part of the PBS series \"America at the Crossroads\" about the post 9/11 world, but PBS executives rejected it.

PBS claims the filmmakers were \"alarmist, overreaching and unfair.\"

The filmmakers say they were censored because of liberal bias at PBS.
