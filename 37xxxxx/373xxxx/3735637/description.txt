    Game Notes:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~
    By 1985, NATO and Warsaw Pact forces had been staring at each other across
    the Iron Curtain for 40 years as the Cold War became increasingly warmer.
    During the mid '80s, the Cold War reached a boiling point as the
    ideologies of communism and capitalism were in their most confrontational
    posture. One spark on the world scene would be all that it would take
    to ignite these

    Powerful military forces and send them crashing into each other across
    the only thing that stood between them in Germany: the open region of
    Erfurt-Eisenach, Vogelsberg, and the highlands north of the Autobahn...
    the region used by the US Third Army to drive deep into Germany at the
    close of WWII  ...the Fulda Gap.
