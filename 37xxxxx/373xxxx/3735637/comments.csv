,Horrido666,2007-07-09T01:08Z,"Seems to be fine here.   There is no install, so to speak.   Extract all files to a directory, and then run Fuldagap85.exe. Are extracting all files?Should be 440 files.  "
,scaz,2007-07-10T17:10Z,"It doesn't work for me either.  There are a lot of files missing.  I downloaded the other HPS campaign games and found the same thing, no exes."
,Horrido666,2008-01-19T18:18Z,Should work.  I use winrar 3.70.  Try that.  Post back if that doesnt work and I'll re UL it.
,FreeHansje,2008-03-05T09:51Z,"Un-RAR ing is not as straitforward is the INF makes you believe, I had the same trouble as Kovacs. I found out you have to UnRAR each file seperately, uncluding the FULDA85.ACE file. All in the same directory.
I still have not found what SETUP and INSTALL should be doing..."
,Horrido666,2008-03-12T05:18Z,"Guys - its not that hard.  Yes you have to unzip all files. This is a very simple thing to do if you use winrar.  After you have all files unzipped, run setup and let it decompress.  Intall is usually used to set up the regestry, but is not needed.

  I didnt create this technique.  Its been a standard on the warez scene for years."
,Horrido666,2008-03-12T05:24Z,"Okay - step by step.

1. Install winrar (google it - free DL)

2. Double click one of the zip files in the fulda directory.

3.  In Winrar, click the little bent up arrow to back out of the zip file you are looking at.  Now in your list you will see all of the zip files in the directory.  Shift click, and select all of them.

4.  Hit the extract button, and extract.  Select overwrite when promted.

5.  Go into the directory you just unzipped th files to.  Double click the .arj file.

6. You will be back in winrar.  Hit extract, and pick a target game directory.

7.  Go to that directory and doubleclick setup.exe.

8. Play the game"
,Horrido666,2008-03-12T05:26Z,Sorry - not an .arj file - its an .ace file. Fulda85.ace to be exact.
,corstar,2008-03-23T20:14Z,"Yep. 
Great instructions it all works fine. Thanks for the awesome upload.

Once installed these games work under WINE for linux. Also, works under virtualbox via windows emulation.."
