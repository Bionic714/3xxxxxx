To anyone else interested, its a pinned topic in the mininova forums games disscussion area. Well worth a view.

,Fragmaster158,2007-07-21T21:46Z,"
 Greetings fellow pirates.

 There is indeed a new enemy amongst torrents and they are trying to control
 all good gaming torrents everywhere. Leeching and dumping data, not sharing
 a bit of data, which is making it near impossible to download many torrents.

 I have included a dopeman_blocklist.txt file. YOU MUST load this file to
 Peerguardian as an addtional blocklist -or- load the file to whatever means
 of IP blocking you have available to your BT Client.

 If you do not, you will simply be sharing data to these cowards and not other
 legit torrent users trying to download. 

 Please try to understand the importance of this. It must be used to begin
 saving game torrents everywhere. This is a new enemy. We must do our best 
 to fight back to preserve our freedom of sharing. 

 Please use the blocklist and share it anyway you can.

 dopeman"

,looking54,2007-12-31T06:08Z,"Thanks . This version is great . Works fine for me , Like the black and white feel to it , as it reminds me of a crime noir and actually gives the story a sense of foreboding , like the effect of the lights being as soft yelow , and the dark red blood , textures look fine but there is a slight staring on the smoke effects since i had to turn anti-aliasing off for speed increase , there is something strange on the bridge , it looks like a bundle of grass blowing on the same spot , really like this game . thanks dopeman"

,saabas,2008-01-12T18:08Z,"Nice job DM!
Its my second playthrough and im wondering what are the mods you included. For example there should be Carry mod, but still can carry 60 KG max. Also there are fuel canisters which were not in original? Does it mean there are drivable cars? I couldnt find any though. 
So are there only graphic/atmosphere mods or are some other type mods too?

,Pr0phecy,2008-03-12T01:55Z,"This would be, bar none, the most awesome seed ever if it wasn't for the Nuclear Snow mod. Every other mod here is perfect and truly a great addition to a great game. 

Dopeman, if it's possible, can you release a version that enables us to choose the mods that we want to utilize? I love every single addition in this Custom Version except the one removing all color. (Despite the good intentions of the author)

Keep up the great work!"

This is what you do: 
STALKER needs huge amount of memory to cache resources.
Right click on ""My computer"" choose ""Properties"", then choose tab ""Advanced"" and click ""Settings"" in ""Performance"" section, in newly opened window choose tab ""Advanced"", there will be ""Virtual memory"" section with information about your current swap file size and button ""Change"".
Click and increase swap size to at least 2Gb. Little advice - do not make it selfgrowing 2-4Gb, but set it static min size = max size. In this case Windows will not fragment it, and performance will be slightly better.
