,Rosechu,2011-03-17T23:12Z,THANK YOU SO MUCH!  I loved this so much when I was a kid I wish it was available on DVD.
,BlAcKsToNePaNdA,2011-10-13T15:11Z,"Thanks for uploading this!! Was a childhood favourite to pass on to my own kids. Unfortunately the quality is terrible. Not bitchin cos its free of course. But me and the kids found it unwatchable

A - 8
V - 6

Thanks all the same"
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2012-03-24T14:20Z,"Ouch.... The quality burns my eyes.
I guess thanks though, can't find this anywhere else.

V:1.5
A:5

If anyone finds a better quality (any better) please post."
