It's a crappy  cam version, but it still packs a punch.  Surprisingly, the punch is mostly in the music.  Supplemented with a couple of studio musicians, the original AC band  could indeed rock.  They never got the respect they deserved.   

If you want to get a DVD (it's cheap), this footage comes from the 1974 feature: ""Good to see you again, Allice Cooper"", which combined this footage with some alleged comedy starring alleged comedian Fred Smoot.  One definite highlight: Alice sings: ""That's Why the Lady is a Tramp"", which, in real life, was supposed to be one of his favorite standards."" 

 Here's where to get the complete film, newly remastered for DVD. (According to the review, there's a ""Play Concert Only button!)

After seeing this incredible footage, I may order it myself."
