Or a kidding joke?
Or is it real?!!!"
,-eXception-,2007-08-15T00:10Z,"brooke78 to upload games to your phone you need to have either MIDWAY or MotoMidMan. Then just choose the game you want, activate Java App Loader on your phone (Definitions -> java -> Java App Loader) then connect the cable to the phone and simply uploade the game to your phone and it should run :)"

The virus is called ""Trojan.Spy.Alexa.A"" it was in a .rar called test33.exe
Bit Defender caught it but, since it's within an archive it couldn't disinfect. I just deleted the whole thing manually."
