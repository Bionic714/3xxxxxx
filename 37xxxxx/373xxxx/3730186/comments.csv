Just one (maybe stupid?) question:
how do i burn this to get a functional DVD off it?
nero tells me a bunch of errors, when trying to burn a video DVD with the material."

,rxav358,2008-12-30T04:48Z,"i have the exact same error, it says that the vob number 5 is missing, it seems that in this torrent there aren't ALL the vob files, but at least there are the vob ones that matter (the ones containing the videos and commercials, cause the ones that are missing contain the trailers of the other directors' dvd)"
