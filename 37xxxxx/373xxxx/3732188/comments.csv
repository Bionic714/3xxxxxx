,smoochy666,2007-07-09T11:16Z,"This one doesn't work; you do get past the registration, but when you update your router (needed for forwarding) you get an error saying the  name and password couldn't be veryfied"

,GYMMY,2007-12-13T22:35Z,"Don't waste your time. If you're using bittorrent, you should know how to configure your router, NOOBS."
,Darcwolf,2007-12-23T11:57Z,"STFU GYMMY! Port forwarding doesn't always work right, I just powercycled my modem, went and forwarded my ports and gee it says their still shut! So I founf this."
,fonejacker13,2008-01-21T03:15Z,"waste of money.. follow the guide on their site to port forward.. im a noob to messing with ports, and after only 2 days, I feel like a pro :D

BTW- There are no REAL cracked versions of this application ;)"
,raindr0ps,2009-01-13T01:53Z,"Does your router or gateway support ""UPnP"" If so there
is a shortcut for mapping ports. Here's how I did it; adapt 
it for you situation.

1. Log on to Actiontec GT704WG. 
2. Go to ""Advanced Setup""
3. Scroll down to ""UPnP"" (universal plug and play)
4. Check ""on"" and ""apply""
5. When screen returns to ""UPnP"" close window

1. Open utorrent.
2. Go to ""Preferences>Connection""
3. Make sure ""Enable UPnP port mapping"" and
    ""Add Windows Firewall exception"" are checked.
    I believe this requires Windows XP SP2
4. Click on ""apply"" and ""ok""
5. Close utorrent. Now utorrent will open and close
   ports as needed. 

Please don't flame me if this doesn't work for you,
it did for me but every computer system is different. 
If this didn't work but helped you to a solution please
post what you did and help out the next person.
If nothing works, you may be a candidate for
port forwarding program. One I haven't tried but would
have if this had caused me too many headaches is at
portforward.com. The small price ain't worth the
headache."

,aditya_ramlochan,2009-02-20T23:26Z,some1 should buy i and upload it to torrent cause this 1 seems to work at first and it says to buy when updating router.
,Footee,2009-05-10T09:28Z,"THIS IS A FULLY WORKING VERSION, YOU DIPSHITS !

When it asks for your password and username;

IT IS THE ROUTERS PASSWORD AND USERNAME that you use to log into 192.168.1.1 or any other ip your porter uses.

Serial code works fine, no problems.

Update list works fine, no problems.

Port forwarded in 5 minutes.
Thanks to the uploader."

,AmiraF,2009-11-09T18:05Z,This works just fine if you read the instructions from previous comments.
,karizma1363,2009-12-15T23:12Z,software works fine.............but what to do if my router is not in the list 
,carsnkrak,2009-12-26T09:19Z,"IF ROUTER/MODEM IS NOT ON LIST!!!!!!!
YOU WILL MANUALY HAVE TO DO IT!!!!!!!!
SO FUCKIN EASY A 5TH GRADER CAN DO IT!!!!!!

you look on your modem and or router 
>if you have both just look on the router
>if you dont know which is which Google it

i have a Netgear router with 2wire modem.
so usually there's a sticker usually on routers or modems that will have bunch of shit but in that cluster fuck of stickers and numbers,
you will see a login address but mine is routerlogin.com 

 not to say yours is but it is tipically 192.168.0.1 on many routers/modems sooo.

recap

1.) find out your modem/router login..............
[Google works  if you cant find the login address]

2.)know your user name and password!!!!!!!!!!
[google the default password for router if you dont know or cant locate it on the router/modem]

 by default most Netgears & some routers are 
 user = admin
 pass = password

that being said

open up internet explorer, firefox, safari what ever gets you dick wet.

next type your login in.
so for me its routerlogin.com

box pops up type in the user name and pass you got. 

now your in... there should be a tab or selection  for port forwarding in there just look.

im tired of typeing just Google the rest or call the 1800 # on your shit for help.

here are some videos on how to do it
