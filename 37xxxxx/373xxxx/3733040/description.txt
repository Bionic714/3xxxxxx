After being defeated by Zaraki Kenpachi and with his sword broken, Zangetsu takes Ichigo into his Inner world, where Ichigo must win Zangetsu back from his inner devil. After fighting him Ichigo then understands that just like Zaraki, he as well was only counting on himself and was using Zangetsu only as a tool without relying on Zangetsu\\\'s power. He asks Zangetsu for a second chance, and gets it. He then returns to Soul society to fight Zaraki again, this time with Zangetsu as his ally, but just as things look promising to Ichigo, Zaraki starts fighting him with full power. Ichigo then lends Zangetsu\\\'s power for the last blow, which will decide everything.
