http://www.gameburnworld.com/gp/gamefixes/hospitaltycoon.shtml

After its downloaded extract it, then goto C:\Program Files\Codemasters\Hospital Tycoon 
Rename Hospital Tycoon.exe (something like that it will be the same as the extracted one) rename whatever, then move the extracted .exe into the same place as the one you just renamed... it should work... it worked for me :D"
