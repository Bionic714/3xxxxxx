,ekdikeo,2007-07-05T05:09Z,"so far, i'm the only seed, and i've seen anywhere from 30-50 people downloading, so it's a pretty long struggle to get it out there.  

Keep workin on it, and we'll eventually get it.  I've been trying to locate this retail for people for months, and it seems impossible :("
,ekdikeo,2007-07-05T06:22Z,"oh, here's something else:

You may want to also pickup a mod that fixes some other problems, as well:

http://mods.moddb.com/8257/bladein/

Install that after installing hte game, and the patch.  It includes a server launcher, as well as fixes for a major performance issue in game, and a bug that causes crashes when downloading from servers.  "
,ekdikeo,2007-07-05T22:11Z,"Sorry about downtime for those stuck at 0K right now, the network drive that has the actual files on it is offline due to an impending lightning storm, and hopefully will be back soon."

,ekdikeo,2007-08-03T01:03Z,"The DNS name for the LOTD Master Server has expired. The server is still running, but to get to it, you'll need to: 

Edit your LOTD.INI file (typically c:\program files\groove games\land of the dead\system\lotd.ini ) 

Find the section titled 

""[IpDrv.MasterServerLink]"" 

Make the first couple lines of it look like: 

[IpDrv.MasterServerLink] 
;MasterServerAddress[0]=www.landofthedeadmatchmaking.com 
MasterServerAddress[0]=68.179.42.242 


ie, put a ; in front of the existing MasterServerAdddress[0] line, and add the new one there. 

When the DNS problem is resolved, then you can remove the change, and it'll go back to the way it was. 

* Server operators, of course, change your server's ini file, as well."

all 4 parts need to be extracted together. this contains every land of the dead: road to fiddlers green map/level ever made for multiplayer mode

(PART 1) http://www.filefront.com/15205965/every-lotd-map-ever-made.7z.001/
(PART 2) http://www.filefront.com/15206743/every-lotd-map-ever-made.7z.002/

(PART 4) http://www.filefront.com/15206857/every-lotd-map-ever-made.7z.004/





before downloading you must know that this is extremely compressed, when extracted it's 7.56 gigs while compressed it's 2.14 gigs. be sure to have about 12 gigs free. need both room to download the files and then more room so it can extract.

Instructions
download all of the ""every lotd ever map made.7z"" files and extract them all together (there are 4 parts). use 7zip (if you don't have it go to www.7zip.org it's free). highlight all the files and right click one of them, select extract. after it is fully extracted place all of the files in your land of the dead install directory ""C:\Program Files\Groove Games\Land Of The Dead""
you'll notice the install directory ""C:\Program Files\Groove Games\Land Of The Dead"" and this update have all the same folders: animations, audio, levels, meshes, system, textures. so what you do is take the files from the folder in this update and place them in the same folder in land of the deads install directory. it's pretty easy.
NOTE: Land of the Dead has a patch V1.1, this must be installed to use any custome made content including everything in this package. the patch can be obtained at http://www.landofthedeadmatchmaking.com/ (land of the deads master server site)

DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THIS CONTAINS:
this package contains every land of the dead road to fiddlers green map ever made by any player as of december 23, 2009. all the update packs (1 - 2, the map and audio packs (1 and 2), the infection pack, and trins lms packs maps are all included in here, plus so much extra. this contains everything lotd has to offer
a total of 728 maps/levels and all the needed files to run them. all are intended for the online play of land of the dead.
the game now has new weapon types modded into certain multiplayer maps, some may just be improved versions of other weapons or the same weapon with a different affect. there's also things like rocket launchers, flame throwers, dynamite, grenades, shovels, hammers, spiked bats, snipers, glocks, uzis, ak-74s, m16s, shotguns, chainsaws, weapons with flashlights attached, mp5s, miniguns, crossbows, reapers, ninjastars, cleavers, dawn rifles, glocks, ETC (way more).

THE ONLINE GAMETYPES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF THEM:
INVASION
All Players vs the zombies. you run around and kill zombies. try to stay alive till the time runs out. some maps are so big it feels like you're playing in an actual city.

CAPTURE THE FLAG
A team based game where you are on 1 of 2 teams, red or blue. you start in your teams base with your teams flag, you must make it to the other teams base and grab their flag then get back to yours without dying, kill anyone or zombie that gets in your way. if you die the flag is left where u died until 1 of the teams grab it. if the opposing team gets the flag it goes straight to their base but if your team gets it, they continue to your base. this game type requires both going for their flag and guarding your own...you need both people leaving and guarding the base at all times

TEAM DEATH MATCH
team based game. start off on either red or blue team, kill players from the opposing team while trying not to be killed by the other team or zombies. the first team to get to the set score wins, or the team with the higher points total when the time runs out wins

DEATH MATCH
Every player for themselves. kill all the other players as many times as you can and die as few times as you can. gain the highest score and watch out for zombies during the set time. first player to reach the set score or the player with the highest score when the time runs out wins.
