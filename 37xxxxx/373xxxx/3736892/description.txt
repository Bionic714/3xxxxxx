Guns N' Roses play an amazing show in Brisbane, Australia (2007-06-19). The setlist includes songs from the fothcoming new GN'R album "Chinese Democracy"!!! It also includes a classic Axl rant when he stops the first song "Welcome To The Jungle" because someone in the crowd through a bottle up on stage and almost hit Axl.
