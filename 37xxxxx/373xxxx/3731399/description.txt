Facing life without parole for a crime he ultimately didn't commit, crook Darien Fawkes is offered a pardon if he'll agree to participate in his brother's medical experiment: the insertion into his brain of a synthetic gland which secretes a light-bending substance called Quicksilver, which renders whoever or whatever is cloaked in it invisible. But Quicksilver also breaks down Darien's sanity without the regular injection of a counter-agent, and when terrorists gun down everyone involved in the project and steal all the relevant information, Darien is recruited by the experiment's backers, an ultra-secret and under-funded intelligence agency subsidized by the Department of Fish and Game, to stop the terrorists, avenge his brother's death, and get a fresh hit of the counter-agent.
