,pofkezas,2007-12-26T23:25Z,"What is the point of uploading mp3 files in .rar? Are there any actual people who enjoy taking that extra step to uncompress it? Seems daft to me. 
But thanks anyways for the upload, this is a great piece."
,Joseh K,2008-02-27T01:29Z,Great recording. Many thanks!
,riffraffselbow,2008-07-09T20:54Z,"A good compression algorithm can take as much as 5% of the total file size off of a set of MP3s. 5mb*however many times this has been downloaded+wastage=a non-trivial amount of bandwidth. Some people pay for bandwidth, but NOBODY pays for uncompressing, short of the electricity."
