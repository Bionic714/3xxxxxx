,profilenx,2007-07-08T23:49Z,Jag använder utorrent. Ska inledande uppladning vara ikryssad när man kollar i egenskaper?

,spitfire7001,2007-07-08T23:58Z,"Right Click on the Torrent in the uTorrent interface and choose Properties, then click the box for Initial Seeding. This will super seed it."
,styles519,2007-07-08T23:58Z,"The torrent is going fine, I've got profilenx in me seeding and it's going fine... just only 1 seed."

,spitfire7001,2007-07-08T23:59Z,F.Y.I Only use super seeding if your the only seed on a torrent.
,lemurofdoom,2007-07-09T00:02Z,oooh... thanks!
,TantalosTantalos,2007-07-09T00:03Z," jesus christ!

,Calle257,2007-07-09T00:04Z,Sry m8 i just want this torrent sooo much !!! plz god make the seeding work !
,devtonix,2007-07-09T00:08Z,It stopped again at 44 mb...
,TantalosTantalos,2007-07-09T00:08Z,i can't beleaive this
,spitfire7001,2007-07-09T00:08Z,"If anyone has an account at SuperTorrents, they got the Bluntzrip up there, which looks a lot like this torrents files.....hmmm. Anyways just reported another pop up of one.

***Edit*** Demonoid also has a divx rip also."
,rendor21,2007-07-09T00:10Z,"1st thanks, 2nd is anyone open to the idea that outside forces are blocking/throttling the bandwidth or whatever on all these ufc73 torrents? I've never seen these things spike and then drop speed like this and it is happening to everyone of us not just me. Does everyone have DHT on? Turn it off, maybe it's the problem?"
,rendor21,2007-07-09T00:11Z,F^@k did I say thanks? I mean that. Thanks
,Sarre,2007-07-09T00:13Z,"Since I haven't seen any sign of UFC 73 in the orly pre-db, I'm guessing this is either homebrew or totally fake.

Either way, I can wait for a scene release."
,TantalosTantalos,2007-07-09T00:14Z,"something is wrong in some way, this is so strange. just like you say, never experienced this before."
,adriana,2007-07-09T00:14Z,is it not any fast copy anywhere on the internet...damn!
,spitfire7001,2007-07-09T00:14Z,"The probelm is, 500+ people are downloading off of one guy with a 1mbit upload line, which rounds out to about 130kbps to 140kbps. Hopefully the super seed he put on will give most his bandwith to someone who can share it faster. Give it about a half hour to a hour to get smoking fast."
,KiSCiX,2007-07-09T00:15Z,"At least this has been re-encoded correctly.

Now seed ppl. dont cap your upload or jesus will curse you."
,adriana,2007-07-09T00:16Z,"I really hope that people that get it seeds, or someone fast uploads it"
,Cumulonimbus77,2007-07-09T00:16Z,"It's going nicely now, good work and thx for the upload."
,adriana,2007-07-09T00:17Z,if I get it i will seed I have 24mbit down and 8mbit up
,TantalosTantalos,2007-07-09T00:18Z,STUCK AT 4.2%!
,spitfire7001,2007-07-09T00:18Z,"I promise to jump on this and seed, i got the same files downloading fast from another source. Its about 50% done right now."
,styles519,2007-07-09T00:20Z,"The only Demonoid UFC73 Divx i saw was like 200MB and a really shitty rip.  I hope this one isn't fake, but based on the way it went down, I doubt it is... a scene release would be nice, but whatever.  

I'm actually shocked that this one wasn't released faster considering that it has a fucking awesome card compared to the last 2 UFC's."
,TantalosTantalos,2007-07-09T00:21Z,spitfire7001 WAY TO GO!

,Armbarsalot,2007-07-09T00:24Z,Thanks a ton ProfileX :) Now I can cancel the 4 gig one lol
,dislate,2007-07-09T00:24Z,"The only torrent with more than one seed is at (http://www.grabthe.info/details.php?id=2750#). 28 at the moment.

Go there and forget the others."
,ivicaje,2007-07-09T00:25Z,thanks mma rules
,dislate,2007-07-09T00:26Z,"Even the one at http://www.xtremewrestlingtorrents.net/ only has one see, go to http://www.grabthe.info/."
,epletull,2007-07-09T00:30Z,"I know it only got one seed, but if you want more mma or a site for future downloading of ufc bouts it's a great site.... I think it's the only place you can find ufc 1 through 73 if you want a complete collection"
,dislate,2007-07-09T00:32Z,"That's appreciated epletull, I do have it bookmarked now, thanks. But for people only interested in getting UFC 73 right now, ASAP, I think http://www.grabthe.info/ is the best bet. =)"
,profilenx,2007-07-09T00:34Z,if you download it frome grabthe.info you can help me seed this one. :)
,epletull,2007-07-09T00:34Z,"dislate: I agree on that on, bro... just wanted to share my love for that site with y'all... nuthn better than watching people kicking ass :D"
,TantalosTantalos,2007-07-09T00:34Z,"awesome! thanks for the inform,ation! this one finally works. my god. trying to get this one the whole day. 
suuuuper thanks!"
,Calle257,2007-07-09T00:36Z,TantalosTantalos the dl speed is verry low so hold your horses mr :P just hang in there
,Calle257,2007-07-09T00:41Z,i´m at 16.7% and my dl speed is 23 kb/sec :S 
,TantalosTantalos,2007-07-09T00:43Z,"i get dizzy from all this...
and i don't see any seeders?"
,dislate,2007-07-09T00:47Z,"21.0% at http://www.grabthe.info/, and 300kb/sec. Plus I got all of the major ones going, this one... the one at Demonoid, and the one at http://www.grabthe.info/. If GTI finishes first, which I'm assuming it will, I will help seed this one profilenx, no worries."
,KiSCiX,2007-07-09T00:48Z,Thanks dislate.
,TantalosTantalos,2007-07-09T00:53Z,i have been trying to get the http://www.grabthe.info/. one to connect for over 10 minutes now but nothing happens... 
,dislate,2007-07-09T00:56Z,"I'm looking at 55 seeders and the tracker is going strong, I'm not sure what to tell you Tantalos. =/"
,Newbee01,2007-07-09T00:57Z,"Hey Profilenx

I have just killed both torrents that i had going and directed them here!  Good job on the torrent, I will wait till I have a faster connection speed b4 I post another PPV.  But when I get a faster speed look for fast releases of the PPV's!"
,TantalosTantalos,2007-07-09T00:59Z,"strange... hmm. well hope this one will work though... and that it's not a fake, then i'm gonna make a door in my wall and say hello to my neightbor. "
,Calle257,2007-07-09T01:01Z,GJ Newbee01 :D i´ll be w8ing ;)
,thegreatstupid,2007-07-09T02:03Z,"profile & newb both own for their work on this particular seed. I'm hoisting a pint of guiness in your honor when this finishes. 

*work harder ye scurvy dogs* *whip crack* aarrrrr"
,dtmac05,2007-07-09T02:06Z,"Awesome to see it's showing 5 seeders now...
Unfortunately my client isn't showing any seeders. 
though i have an assload of leachers"
,nalu22,2007-07-09T02:08Z,"Thank you!

Friggin leachers!

7 seeds and 803 leaches...ruining it for all of us!"
,dtmac05,2007-07-09T02:23Z,"i went over to GTI and checked there torrent.
147 seeders, 400 or so leachers.

Needless to say i started the DL there too"
,rendor21,2007-07-09T02:29Z," Ever since the past 150 or so leechers jumped in my ipfilter is going berzerk, it's one thing to deal with leechers but another thing to deal with all these pigs who get paid to log $hit and do there dirty work. Isn't there a way to cut those a$$holes off? For F^@# sake people turn off DHT and peer exchange..I've only said it now 500 times. Fight the Bastards!"
,dislate,2007-07-09T02:47Z,"GTI done, now seeding there and here with the same files. Will go till I'm 10.0 in ratio. Enjoy when you get it. =)"
,dislate,2007-07-09T02:51Z,"On a side note, I'd stay away from Demonoid. There still is only 1 seeder, and none in the swarm. But since I already started it, I'm going to let it run and seed it when it is done. =)"
,meleekid,2007-07-09T03:27Z,"Im a newbee. how do I get this show on my computer? I'll follow proper protocol, so I don't piss you all off..."
,meleekid,2007-07-09T03:48Z,ok thanks for the help. I figured out that I need a bittorrent client....any suggestions for mac osx??
,silntSpct0r,2007-07-09T04:59Z,"Oh, and thanks for the upload profilenx. You've won the prize of 1000 INTERWEBS!!1 "
,Piratesteamy,2007-07-09T05:47Z,"currently seeding.

Not getting video.
Have audio.

Any suggestions what I'm forgetting (I just reformatted comp)? Tried it in different players.

Maybe missing a codec?

Never had a problem before."
,profilenx,2007-07-09T05:53Z,seed when you are done.
,Dankouver,2007-07-09T06:02Z,USE A VLC PLAYER
,Piratesteamy,2007-07-09T06:12Z,"Working in Divx player.
Just hadn't downloaded the player yet.

Video looks good and sound good.

Thanks.

,danrisludde,2007-07-09T07:36Z,Thanx profilenx. Finally a useable torrent.
,Cumulonimbus77,2007-07-09T08:21Z,"For all you newbies with questions; try google, that'll help you a lot more than asking some of the assholes in these comments."

,profilenx,2007-07-09T10:14Z,my utorrent says 166 seeders and over 4000 lechers.... Dont stop seeding this one! Think about all the other people also. Please.... =)

,yazovyet,2007-07-09T18:17Z,"profilenx, that wec 28 link you posted doesnt lead anywhere and the lsit of things you have uplaoded seems to be limited to ufc 73 and a codec pack. seeing frank shamrock vs baroni would be very interesting"
,ejne,2007-07-09T21:45Z,finns det nån som kan fixa förmatcherna till ufc 73 ? 
,Sektion8,2007-07-10T01:05Z,"You could've at-least given the capper credit cockhead. All thanks belongs to BLUNTZ!! Capping every single major mma show, without the bullshit."
,Eilola,2007-07-10T01:36Z,"it was supposed to be the best ufc ever!!! hahahah fucking rubbish not one good fight sorry to disappoint all who hasnt seen this but fuck ufc73!!

,TantalosTantalos,2007-07-13T16:30Z,the fightcard was awesome but the fights was kind of a let down...
,laponist,2007-07-19T12:50Z,"Exellent.... The fight is on..been watching ""pride"" in vegas last, and what a disapointment.
No knees, elbows on the ground. I hope the new management gets with the program and makes some new fightrules.
