  5 / 5 (based on 1 rating).

Plot:	An incredibly young Gordon Liu does his thing here in this film that claims to have offered him his first credited role.

Overview:	A lost classic! The first film starring Gordon Liu Chia Hui, better known to the world as the Master Killer. He might not be a monk, but he is definitely a holy terror. See the master unleash his fury on his enemies for the first time. His first might not be his best, but it's the deadliest!
