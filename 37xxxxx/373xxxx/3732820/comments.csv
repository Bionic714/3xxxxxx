,Col. Burton,2007-07-05T21:14Z,"I'm sorry that it's going so slow, I have no idea what it can be. My uploadspeed is 500 kb/s, but this torrent won't use that speed =/"
,Col. Burton,2007-07-05T21:18Z,"Okey, got it sorted out now. 
Couple of settings that were wrong."
,epletull,2007-07-06T23:04Z,"2 days downloading and only 2.5gb down... that sucks, but when there's only one seeder and 50 leechers one can not expect that much neither.. Just keep seeding after you're done... I know I will.
cheers"
,rappie,2007-07-10T01:11Z,"Nice :)

,Col. Burton,2007-07-29T23:53Z,"Hi!

I am very sorry that this is taking so long. 
All of a sudden my ISP limited my upload to 512 kbit/s. That is a downgrade from around 4000 kbit/s so that is why.

It is taking long, but many of the leechers are now almost complete, almost 20 leechers are 96.5% done. 

I want to ask all of you to seed this one. 
I will seed it for a very long time =)"
,Col. Burton,2007-07-29T23:54Z,"By the way, the reason the upload stopped the 26-27, was because my internet connection went down."
,epletull,2007-08-03T20:29Z,"thanks for the up man, seeded up to a 2-1 ratio, but had to stop... no more space on the hd so had to move the files... anywho, thanks again dude... great work :D"
,Col. Burton,2007-08-04T23:22Z,"I would really like people to seed, not just hit and run. 

I'm going offline for a month now, so if people want this release, they better get some seeders.

And I would thank those people who actually have seeded/is seeding. 
This is a big torrent, so we need some good seeders damn it ^^"
