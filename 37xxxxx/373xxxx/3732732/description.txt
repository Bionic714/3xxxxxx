 Don?t ever trust the law.

 When a beautiful call girl survives a brutal mob hit that takes out several undercover cops, the police chief (Gary Busey) assigns his two best detectives (legendary kick boxer Don ?The Dragon? Wilson and Olivier Gruner) to protect her. But no matter where they hide, they are repeatedly ambushed by a lethal gang of killers. The two cops, with their polar-opposite styles of law enforcement, struggle to keep working together under the cloud that one of them is the informant. Heart-racing action turns this explosive tale of corruption and the underworld into a powerhouse of deadly betrayal.
