The entire tape got recorded, so each song had to be seperated and enhanced as much as possible manually.  Some of these are obviously going to be higher quality than others..the deck he used at the time wasn't that great...but for many of them it was the last time they got played.

I'm also tossing around the idea of getting a paid external hosting place for these ... but I'm not sure as to the pros/cons of doing that, nor how to create a file to an external server."
