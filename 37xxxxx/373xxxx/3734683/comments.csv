,CityVisionNYC,2007-07-07T04:19Z,This post is the same one that I uploaded earlier. I forgot to mention that you need to use the 1111-1111-1111-1111-1111-1111 serial number when installing the application. I hope nobody got messed up. Well this is the only true working crack for CS so oh well. Enjoy...
,FSDude,2007-07-08T00:59Z,"Can't seem to get yours to work either. I download CS3, install it (it doesn't ask for a serial number during install) then have to run Photoshop. Then it asks for serial number, but all 1's comes up as a bad number. Then copy in your files and it says you need to repair your install."
,CityVisionNYC,2007-07-08T08:55Z,I'm not sure which version ur trying to install but mine asks for a serial number. I'll upload my version now. look for skyhigh's photoshop CS
,CityVisionNYC,2007-07-08T08:57Z,The program is already on there it's called All Adobe dvd. it's a program that includes all the adobe products on 1 DVD. If u don't want that one I'll check which CS version mine is and if need be I'll upload it.
,CityVisionNYC,2007-07-08T09:00Z,My photoshop is Photoshop CS version 8. I've installed it many times and did so just yesterday and it works perfect.
,CityVisionNYC,2007-07-08T09:02Z,copy the files before running the program. It should ask for a serial number before install u put (1111-1111-1111-1111-1111-1111) after it will ask for activation. just cancel and then copy the 2 files into the directory of the app. then run it and it will run fine
