,ExoSoftSupport,2007-07-02T20:33Z,I will pay close attention and seed whenever it gets too low.
,ExoSoftSupport,2007-07-02T20:39Z,You better seed... I see 3 leechers already... I can seed for a long time but 3 against 1 is hard LOL.
,ParticleX,2008-01-14T09:10Z,"definitely works, although i downloaded a newer version and the keygen still works. no viruses or whatsoever crap that should not be included. works waaaaaaay faster than my Symantec Endpoint Protection for my Win2003 Server Ent. SP2. my PC now boots up faster. 

thanks!

will seed for a month"
,qck240,2008-04-08T19:44Z,NO GOOD NO GOOD.....the free AVG picked up virus is the keygen and trogan in the AVG .exe
,Akbar_The_Great,2008-05-06T22:06Z,"Keygen has a Trojan Horse that AVG heals by deleting it.

The Trojan Horse in the KeyGen makes this download worthless."
,Jad-B,2008-05-30T11:26Z,"pointless... I cant see anyone seeding!


And all those Trojans and virus, don't think i will be downloading."
