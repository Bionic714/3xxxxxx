This is the live documentary from Bad Religion\\\\\\\'s Against The Grain tour in 1991. It\\\\\\\'s not been reissued on DVD, so this is a VHS to DVD rip. The quality is not great, but I think it\\\\\\\'s very watchable. I transferred it from an original VHS tape. The sound is very good and the setlist and performance are awesome!

Here\\\\\\\'s a sample clip from the same VHS, although the quality is much worse than on my version: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2DrP9QcpSU&mode=related&search=
