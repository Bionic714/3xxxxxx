   In late September 1942, while all eyes where focused on the titanic struggle
   taking place at Stalingrad, Stalin Zhukov, and the rest of Stavka met to
   access the military situation and discuss offensive plans for the upcoming
   winter. Zhukov convinced them that the Red Army had amassed enough strategic
   reserves to conduct two major counteroffensives. The counterattack at
   Stalingrad was the most famous, but here in the Rzhev salient Marshal
   Zhukov planned the second strike - Operation mars. The operatation was meant
   to destroy the German 9th Army and eliminate the German threat on Moscow. As
   the Soviet player, can you accomplish Zhukov's goals of defeating the German
   9th Army and pinching off the Rzheve salient? Or as the German player, can
   you halt and defeat the massive Soviet armies that threaten your entire
   Army Group Center?
