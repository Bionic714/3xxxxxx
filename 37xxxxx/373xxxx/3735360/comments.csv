,Alle88,2007-07-07T23:47Z,"Presidential candidate for 2008 in the USA. Please follow the google video link to view his speech, or visit his website at ronpaul2008.com

If you want to spread the knowledge about him download the DVD, copy it and hand it out to friends, relatives and in public, not least Ron Pauls rallys and other presidential campaign events.

Thanks!

P.S.

Dont forget to visit Ron Pauls youtube channel, accessible through a link at the ron paul official campaign website mentioned above. Thanks again, for helping me seed this and get his message out."

I highly recommend viewing his videos on Youtube, he is a straight-talker and in my opinion one of the very few politicians who truly cares about America."
