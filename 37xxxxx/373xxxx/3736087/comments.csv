,Quoth,2007-07-08T21:16Z,Drum roll in progress to see if this is a copy with audio that works correctly. Will report back after the 4gb have finished downloading :P
,Quoth,2007-07-09T22:14Z,"Good copy... sound works. Subtitles appear to be hard encoded in to the black bar at the bottom so they cant be turned off.. but hell.. if you've downloaded the other copy at least you can finish watching it with the right sound.

Thanks to the uploader."
,banman,2007-07-09T23:44Z,"Accordin to the sample, the picture quality is far from dvd quality. Looks like cam. "

,ekbladh78,2007-07-11T18:45Z,"MILKOD2001: can you read? TS is of course not a dvd, its a cam with some improvment but this is one of the best TS i have seen so far"
,jemma-83,2007-07-13T23:47Z,"Hm, yes a ts(telesync) is a filmed with a videocam in a public cinema, but the sound is taken from the digital source so the sound should be more or less(depending on compressionlevel) the same as dvd or higher."
,ekbladh78,2007-07-14T09:27Z,"try to lern things before talking

A telesync is the same spec as a CAM except it uses an external audio source (most likely an audio jack in the chair for hard of hearing people). A direct audio source does not ensure a good quality audio source, as a lot of background noise can interfere. A lot of the times a telesync is filmed in an empty cinema or from the projection booth with a professional camera, giving a better picture quality. Quality ranges drastically, check the sample before downloading the full release. A high percentage of Telesyncs are CAMs that have been mislabeled."
,mackan66,2007-07-14T22:56Z,dum fråga...varför funkar ljudet på datorn men inte när jag har bränt ner filmen på en DVD-skiva?Jag är inte så insatt i det här som alla ni andra verkar vara!Tacksam för svar.
,ekbladh78,2007-07-15T20:14Z,"du har antagligen inte rätt ljudformat inställt på din dvd, kolla med audiokanppen på fjärrisen eller så kanske inte din spelare klara din skiva fullt ut beroende av +/-"
,gelia,2007-07-19T22:00Z,ska man ladda ner den?? blir lite förvirad av allting ni skriver :P
,poxy13,2007-07-26T21:37Z,"the soundquality is ok I suppose, BUT PPL WHO SAY THAT THE PICTURE IS GOOD NEED TO GET THEIR EYES CHECKED! Seriously! Total waste of bandwith, this is."

,pyne_power,2007-12-08T20:02Z,ofta 5.1 på en ts?:P
,AlexDenStore,2007-12-31T19:52Z,"Okay, okay! You all write a whole lot of shit here! Simple question, what we ALL wanna know. Okay?
Okay:
1. Is it working?
2. Is there any sound?
3. Is it possible to see? (Directly on the computer too?)
4. Is this good shit to watch? Or is this whole movie a damn pile of crap??

Thank you..."
