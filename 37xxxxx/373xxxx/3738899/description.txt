CRITICA:
If music be the food of love, then Under the Desert Sky is an Italian feast. 
Andrea Bocelli performs live at the Lake Las Vegas resort for this DVD and bonus CD, featuring some of the world's greatest love songs. In straying from the largely
 classical repertoire that helped shoot Bocelli to stardom, he is able to take more 
contemporary material and give it the sheen of timelessness. Most of the selections are in Italian, Spanish, or French--Romance languages, naturally. Highlights include the swoon-inducing "Amapole," the pitch-perfect "Canzoni Stonate," and even a reverent "Can't Help Falling in Love." Through it all, Bocelli's relaxed, self-effacing manner and confident delivery make for an intimate concert experience. Bocelli is also backed by a terrific group of talented musicians, including pianist and executive producer David Foster. A real show-stopper: Bocelli's duet with the Tony-winning Aida singer Heather Headley; the blending of their voices suggests the duets of Aaron Neville and Linda Ronstadt at their most sublime. There's only one real clunker: "Besame Mucho," which is so innately cheeseball that trying to deliver it sincerely only makes it more cheesy. Included is a CD with nine tracks,including a different version of "Can't Help Falling in Love," with a duet by American Idol's Katherine McPhee, and a soulful "Canzoni Stonate" with Stevie Wonder. DVD extras include interviews with Bocelli, Foster, and others (be sure to turn on your subtitles manually if you're not an Italian speaker). That's amore!
