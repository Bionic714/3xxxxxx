[V],nos1977,2007-08-15T14:55Z,The Emoticons you just add like... open a window with anyone in it... and where it says select an emoticon (Bottom left) Click show all... (and you see a place to add them...) it says Create... Then you will see... Find Image... Select the Emoticon you want to and name it... That should work...
