,apwnage,2007-12-19T06:08Z,"K there is a movie in all that trash he sent. I guess I was wrong but still thats a lot of trash and it nearly crashed my computer. But guess what? Not ipod compatible, you might have to wait for about 16 hours while your itunes makes it compatible. On itunes it takes even longer on slower central processing unit computers. The video takes a while just to be transfered. Im sorry about all the shit I said but still, when your making an mp4 movie remember to get rid of all the extra trash before you make it. Also make sure its ipod compatible before you upload it. I think the movie is somewhat clost to HD but some parts are extremely pixaled up. Anyway I dont know about this torrent. Bad downloading times, takes way too long, has problems being transfered, is kind of a big mp4 for such a short movie, only good thing is the quality, also the other problem is the trash in it, and it is not compatible with ipods as soon as you download it. I rate it about a 1.4/10"
