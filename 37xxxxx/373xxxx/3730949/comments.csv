,brankin199,2007-07-05T19:40Z,I have heard the mod is spose to be amazing but is it all its been made out to be?
,lalala1,2007-07-23T02:41Z,"a) this game plays like a Dod Reskin with new maps. Nothing new here except NO in-game map which balances things heavily against noobs.  Instead you get waypoints that can be set by a commander (who also can't see a map). Hooray for ""realism"" trumping game design.
b) There is nothing NOTHING having to do with an insurgency in this game, it's an extremely typical us vs them camp fest.  But it's in Iraq! With desert skins! /yawn"
