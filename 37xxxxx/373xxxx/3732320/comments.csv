,ShadowMastr,2008-12-20T03:07Z,"outstanding group, outstanding collection in a torrent.

Major complaint: why no Yessongs? Arguably the best live Yes you will ever hear, at their peak and a commercially available lp??"
,camarillo93012,2010-01-05T05:44Z,If you 28 leachers - 4 seeders??? Leachers open up your bandwith allocation and set your upload limit to unlimited. This torrent will speed up 10X. At the current rate I'll be dead by the time this downloads!!!
,camarillo93012,2010-01-05T05:46Z,I forgot to thank beerpal for this and the many links that are posted!!! Thank You!!!
