,sweets1970,2008-02-28T23:47Z,"The keygen works fine and has all the options including a ""not for retail (all options and agents)"" key generator.  Worth its weight in gold."
,smilerman,2008-12-04T23:33Z,"the keygen.exe is showing as a trojan with symantec AV 10 for me, anyone else having this problem? if so how did you solve it? I tried excluding and even turning off AV with no effect, advice appreciated."
