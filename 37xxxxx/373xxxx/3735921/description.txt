 By July 1943, the tides of war had turned on the Germans. Tunisia fell in May
 leaving no Axis territory in North Africa. On July 5th they had launched their
 last great offensive on the Russian Front at Kursk and were nearing their
 farthest point of advance when the Allies struck at the "soft underbelly"
 of Europe by invading Sicily. The invading American and British forces took
 38 days to capture the island due to the skillful defense and fighting
 withdrawl in some of the most difficult terrain in the war prompting to
 call this battle a "Bitter Victory". Can you capture the island faster?
 Should the Allies have opted to have Patton invade western Sicily instead
 of cover Montgomery's flank? Find out with Sicily '43!
