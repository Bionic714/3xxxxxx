Metallica's performance in London, England at the Live Earth Festival (2007-07-07). They chose just to play songs from their most commercial and selftitled album this night to really get the crowd going, and If you ask me, I think they definitely did it!

Tracklist:

01 - Metallica - Sad But True
02 - Metallica - Nothing Else Matters
03 - Enter Sandman
