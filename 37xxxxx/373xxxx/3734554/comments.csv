This is the correct tracklist:

01 Mannish Boy
02 Baby Please Don't Go
03 (I'm Your) Hoochie Coochie Man
04 40 Days And 40 Nights
05 I Feel So Good
06 Rollin' And Tumblin'
07 You Can't Lose What You Ain't Never Had
08 Goin' Home
09 I Can't Be Satisfied
10 I'm Ready
11 Rock Me
12 Rollin' Stone
13 Sad Letter
14 She Moves Me
15 Walkin' Thru The Park
16 All Aboard
17 You Gonna Need My Help
18 So Glad I'm Living

I believe this CD does not exist. 
The frontcover was modified from the original 1992 ""Mannish Boy"" CD of Midnite Label which contains only 4 tracks.

I would really like to see the backcover but of course, it was not shared. Sometimes I wonder who makes this kind of ""fantasy albums"".
