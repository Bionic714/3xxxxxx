,eskofot,2007-07-12T17:16Z,"fasterthanhell, you should have called yourself ""dumberthanhell"". Mind your language. Even though you are obvious dissatisfied, there's no reason for this attack on an uploader. Kindness costs nothing, your way of adressing others is at the expence of noone having any respect for your person.
Why do i even bother, guess there's no reason trying to explain that to a 12 year old spoiled schoolboy"
,fasterthanhell,2007-07-12T20:27Z,"Kindness cost nothing,,,haha your a fucking criminal' dont get up on any high horses here cocksucker' dont now why you bother,,,probebly cause your an assface without a decent life':) if it says english subs there should be english subs,,,thats fucking easy'"
,hedden,2007-07-12T22:38Z,"fasterthanhell: It spells ""don't know why you bother"" not ""don't now why you bother"" and ""probably"" not ""probebly"" and you say ""high horse"" not ""high horses"". Are you sure you can read the english subs? cause you sure ass hell can't write english"
,eskofot,2007-07-12T22:59Z,"He's just a kid having learned whatever English he knows from American third rate movies, that's pretty clear. Just a copycat, who doesn't even understand the meaning of the words he's pukin'  ;-)"

,iljutz,2007-07-15T00:04Z,Only english sub? And call this PAL... It's rather NTSC than PAL. My ass is more PAL than this movie.
,FINGERMOUSE,2007-07-16T11:40Z,"picture is v good but sound is not 5.1 there is just a muffled noise from rear speakers.
