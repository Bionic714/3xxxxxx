,shmuckhead,2007-07-11T23:04Z,Thanks again. Will seed to at least 1 to 1.
,Beeeye,2007-07-11T23:22Z,"thanks once again 4X, I have been looking for this. I just got FS global installed last night too :)  I know how you hate requests but I'd love to get my hands on :
Cloud9 Orlando International KMCO. Absolutely beautiful design"
,4X-AXG,2007-07-11T23:27Z,ah so you did succeed in installing Global? I see some people having trouble with it
,Beeeye,2007-07-11T23:33Z,"yes, I just put all the install images in the same folder and it went. I am noticing some problems with it though. Im my home city there is a powerplant thats underwater now because fs global changed where the water was slightly. I also noticed the same problem in vancouver. Perhaps I have the scenery in the wrong priority."
,blankbox,2007-07-12T00:17Z,Beeeye - Nope..affects of global warming...get used to it..
,zoidzoid,2007-07-12T03:49Z,"4X

Big thanks for packing these things up; much harder to dl the other way."
,flyboi708,2007-07-12T04:24Z,"LMAO hahahahaha AMEN!! thanks 4X

please note. if you don\'t like this add-on (hell, even I don\'t like it myself), that\'s fine, just go search for some porn and jerk off. no messages like \'these models suck man, bla bla bla is so much better\' there ARE people out there who want this. I sometimes get more downloads and thank-yous for Perfect Flight and Abacus add-ons than anyone can imagine. if you like it, download it. if you don\'t like it, stay away."
,DERECTIV,2007-07-12T05:29Z,"same shit ,but thanks"
,Beeeye,2007-07-12T06:28Z,"This is alright, and what I have been using for the last little while. The models are low quality to help on the fps. This version works the best.

what are other good traffic addons? I hear something called skai traffic or something is the best."
,hirstey,2007-07-12T12:26Z,WTF is flyboi708 on about? Thanks 4X
[T],upsdave,2007-07-12T23:05Z,"Thanks so much 4X, all of your uploads have been great. Most of my FSX addons have come from you, and they are all top quality. I read someting new is coming out, and I think of you, and you usually come out with it. Thanks again for the effort. I never have to request, I just wait, and you usually end up sharing it!!!! :>)"
,eNuffSaid,2007-07-12T23:50Z,"Thanks again 4X. More goodies from you. I would like to ditto the above poster's comments.

I salute you.
'nuff"
,4X-AXG,2007-07-13T00:28Z,"thanks upsdate, those are the kind of messages that really motivate me to keep on posting stuff :) expect a lot more from me in the upcoming weekend and week ;-)"
,zal93gri,2007-09-02T11:03Z,is this the full game ore addon packed?
,NoobFace,2007-10-01T20:53Z,wich version is this for?
,DataAndroid,2007-10-23T00:21Z,"Again, Thanx a lot 4X.
I'll keep seeding for awhile.
Can't wait for acceleration to be released ;>)"
,Klm89,2007-11-11T10:56Z,"OK downloaded it but how do you open it? XP only asks me which program do I want to open it with, (or is it just drag and drop into, which file)?"
,kendo.nagasaki,2007-12-04T04:49Z,"This is laughably awful!  I would be really pee'd of if i'd paid for this!!  Try a different package THAT HAS AN AUTOMATED INSTALLER ffs!

Its not even much of an improvement over WorldOfAI or ProjectAI.  WOAI is far superior in fact!"
,kendo.nagasaki,2007-12-04T04:51Z,"BTW not diss'ing the Uploader, just that i spent a frustrating 2 hours trying to get this pile of pooh working.  Not worth the effort.
"
,Husky42,2007-12-27T11:12Z,"BE AWARE:

What 4X-AXG does is like Fairlight stealing something from Razor or Deviance.

This would not happen within groups, it is about competition. All 4X-AXG has managed to do was alienate himself as a non team player and thief.

This would not have been accepted years ago. A child to the game 4X-AXG will continue to steal. But be aware, he has never released a file that was not released elsewhere first.

He has never purchased and sold, or donated to help a cause. He is the lowest of the lowest when it comes to file sharers and in no way deserves any form of respect. He does not even know how to give appropriate credit.

4X-AXG you are nothing more then a pathetic fucking thief."
,ikkeno,2008-01-01T20:31Z,wil it work for me? i got an 2.20 mhz prosessor.. please anwser!

,indianplatys,2008-01-26T18:02Z,"I have downloaded and insalled. But there is no other AI traffic!!! What do I have to do to see the traffic?

Please help me.
And thanks for the upload!"
,magnum1,2008-03-03T11:45Z,"Thx 4X!

By the way... Anybody have the two updates (5.1a and 5.1b) to this package? This version does not allow to update (or I made wrong...)."
,Alex030594,2008-04-03T12:59Z,"7Hi!
