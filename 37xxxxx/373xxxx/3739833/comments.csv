,Zen82,2007-07-13T07:10Z,This actually REVERES Hugo Chavez?  Socialism has already taken over America hasn't it?  Apparently so has idiocy
,duhprane,2007-07-16T16:41Z,"HA - the failed coup in Venezuela is JUST ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF BUSHCO INCOMPETENCE -

ZEN82 -''PUSSY'' just cant take it..... HA HA  "
,duhprane,2007-07-16T16:43Z,"Oh, I almost forgot Fuck Chavez in the ass..... but this is still worth watching, thanks for the file."
,atom224,2007-08-20T22:44Z,"interesting, this guy is always portrayed as a bastard.  I loved how this new government just showed up after the coup and that when leaving they emptied the safe.  Typical huh?  and interesting that the failed president resides in Miami.  I am sure this guy isn't perfect, but a government that tries to remove a democratically elected president is much worse.  Anyone disturebed that the march path was changed by the media and who is there ? snipers.  This just smells funny.  Scary shit."
,atom224,2007-08-25T15:31Z,"he closes papers and some news networks.  most likely the ones that encouraged a coup, and they have been bought and paid for by someone.  Look at the big picture !   do you think our news is free ? get real."
,cidfollador,2007-10-01T07:11Z,Chavez is a criminal dictator
,atom224,2007-11-09T06:42Z,criminal dictactor like ours you mean?  do you live in Venezuela?  I am only asking because I would really like to hear from a citizen.  Our US media can make anyone look like a criminal.  That one sided reporting has drug us into many wars.

[T],lkobescak,2007-11-09T15:23Z,Chavez follows the constitution and was elected by the people of his country not by electronic fraud.
,codair,2007-11-19T19:54Z,Thank you very much lkobescak for putting out the truth!  Needless to say that we need it.
,thumbslikeonions,2007-12-11T09:45Z,"Socialism? America? The USA is a puritan nation all the way. I think Chavez and his ilk are denigrated so much because they help to deflect attention from the misdeeds of the perceived 'good guys'. Chavez is far from a saint, but he's no more corrupt and power-hungry than Bush, Blair, Brown et al. Chavez is the latest in a long line of hate figures designed to whip up jingoisitc fervour and bolster the military-industrial complex. The fact that he isn't reliant on US economic assistance also makes him a 'dangerous tyrant,' as he can't be controlled through the conventional channels.  "
,atom224,2007-12-16T22:48Z,"I am amazed that any leader who doesn't immediately join with Bush and turn over their resources, is labeled a criminal.  ""You're either with us or against us""  I also don't understand why these topics don't interest the average American?  But as bad as Chavez is, we still get oil from him as a ""donation"" to those in poverty.  In other words, you're a bad guy, but we'll take your free oil.  It boggles the mind."
,Locobox,2008-05-08T13:59Z,"Thanks for this! is very important at least for me to know both side versions (US & Venezuela)

Also watch if interested on this matter ""The war on democracy (2007)"" from John Pilger great documentary."
,mbpedro007,2009-03-14T20:03Z,thanks for the film. dictatorship (my arse) or not.. we need more nations to stand up and be counted against imperial powers.
