History

NOLA (1991-1995)
The first release was NOLA (for New Orleans, Louisiana) in 1995, an album combining the typical New Orleans "sludge doom" sound with distinct blues and country overtones. A short tour of 13 dates was undertaken shortly after the album's release. Following the tour, Down was put on hold to allow its members to return to their respective bands.
Down II (2001-2002)
The band regrouped in 2001 to record the more diverse album entitled Down II: A Bustle in Your Hedgerow. The line-up was the same, apart from the replacement of Todd Strange with Rex Brown as bass player. Another tour was undertaken, both on their own and as part of Ozzfest in the summer of 2002. The band was then once more put on hold, as lead singer Anselmo wished to focus his efforts on Superjoint Ritual, which also featured Bower on guitar.
Down III (2006-Present)
Down are in the process of writing and recording a new studio album, currently referred to as Down III. Pepper Keenan has recently stated that the band have finished writing the new album's material and are due to record it in February. The band have numerous acoustic songs written and have some material recorded. The band are looking at an end of summer release. Anselmo is understood to be one of the driving forces behind the new album and is quoted as saying "I want my band back", in reference to Down. In a recent statement from bassist Rex Brown, Down will be re-releasing their debut album NOLA with Rex playing the bass tracks. He has also stated that both Down albums are going to be remastered and re-released[1].
Along with Megadeth, Down will be opening for Heaven and Hell on their upcoming Canadian tour. The latter band features members of Black Sabbath starting with a show in Vancouver, BC on March 11 2007 [2]. Down's March 13th set in Edmonton as well as every subsequent show were cancelled last minute as Phil developed Strep Throat, much to the dissapproval of fans hoping to see them. The band has stated that they will be returning for "make-up". Down rejoined the tour on 20 March at Sault Ste. Marie's Steelback Centre.
