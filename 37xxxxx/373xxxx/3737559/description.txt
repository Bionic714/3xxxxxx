Summary   

	When gun fancier Bart Tare sees Annie Laurie Starr's sideshow sharpshooting act, 
he's a dead-bang goner. He and she go together, as Bart ultimately says, "like guns and ammunition".

The two become bank robbers on the run, eluding roadblocks and roaring into movie history s one of the 
benchmark film-moir works.
