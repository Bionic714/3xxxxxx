Yes, Hexen was first released for the PC. It was then ported to the N64. Same game."
,angryrabbit,2008-08-18T01:03Z,"Note that for OS X users, you will need CCD2ISO (or a program like it) to convert the .img, .sub and .ccd files into a single .iso file that you can burn using Disk Utility.

CCD2ISO can be found here:

It size is 40 mb after installation, and images are not required at all.

I can not understand, what differents between this 400 mb image-version and other less-sized versions?"

,niggawithattitude,2009-04-03T12:55Z,Can someone tell me how to run this games? The game crashes after i start it.
