A needledrop of the vinyl mastered by Steve Hoffman. Apparently this has better sound than the CD release. This is in FLAC format (see http://flac.sourceforge.net/ for info and how to play).

I didn't make this vinyl rip and I don't know what equipment was used, but it sounds pretty good.

Track listing:

A1. Icky Thump
A2. You Don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do As You're Told)
A3. 300 M.P.H. Torrential Outpour Blues
B1. Conquest
