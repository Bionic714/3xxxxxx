,herbman75,2007-07-06T18:36Z,Thanks for making this available. I hear the CD has all sorts of digital clipping and unintentional distortion.
,terlisimo,2007-07-10T17:32Z,"herbman75 you are correct.

I'm actually sorry I shelled out for the CD version. It is sooo badly produced my ears hurt."
,stevemtno,2007-07-16T23:54Z,Are Meg's vocals cut out here or on the CD version?
,RootOut,2007-09-14T16:18Z,"kool! i almost... ahh :) kool! vinyl rocks!!!!

,p00ntang69,2008-01-14T16:25Z,"Thankyou for this - no wonder I didn't wear the cd out like i did with ""get behind"" "
,yodayodayodayoda,2008-02-13T09:03Z,"Thanks for the seeds guys.  I have a question-is there any good way to compress from FLAC to MP3?  I am comfortable using EAC, will it work?  Or do I have to go to LAME directly?"
,TheNightOwl,2008-02-13T09:37Z,"yodayodayodayoda:

EAC is used to rip/extract the music off of a CD. You need a program like the excellent foobar2000 (http://www.foobar2000.org/download.html) and it is free."
,BlankWyman,2008-09-23T12:34Z,"Both ""Icky Thump"" and ""Rag and Bone"" are different mixes to the incredibly screwed up CD version (and we only have Vlado Meller to blame for that). I have nothing but respect for Steve Hoffman, I only wish he had mastered the cd version of the album too!"
