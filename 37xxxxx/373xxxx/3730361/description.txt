This is an absolutely beautiful flim, with two beautiful, shining stars. Deborah Kerr, always the epitome of British lady-like reserve... that dainty face and that curled red hair... always bringing a grace to the roles she plays (except for Karen Holmes in \\\"From Here To Eternity\\\"... but that\\\'s another story). She\\\'s breathtakingly grand as Terry McKay, the class-act who falls in love with a playboy (Grant), though she is engaged to another. And Cary ... the most gorgeous person to EVER grace this earth! He\\\'s absolutely marvelous as playboy Nickie Ferrante, who finds himself falling quickly in love with someone other than his fiancee. I have never seen chemistry on screen like this! Although the movie may be classified as \\\"sap\\\" or \\\"a love story\\\"... it\\\'s got it\\\'s funny moments (\\\"Do you think it will ever take the place of night baseball?\\\", \\\"Top of the mornin\\\' to ya!\\\"--\\\"And the rest of the day to you!\\\"). But there are some scenes that just absolutely take your breath away... like when they are visiting Nickie\\\'s grandmother (in my opinion, the point that they realize their deep love for each other). Also, when they meet their fiancees in New York and while Terry\\\'s hugging Ken, Nickie gently kisses his fingertips and places them on her glove, and then she holds her glove to her cheek. Truly divine. However, the defining moment of this film (believe me, you better have some hankies handy!) is at the end... the look on Grant\\\'s face whenever he sees the portrait is PRICELESS. And of course, Kerr\\\'s voice trembling at the words \\\"Darling, don\\\'t look at me like that.\\\" I give this movie a definite 10.
