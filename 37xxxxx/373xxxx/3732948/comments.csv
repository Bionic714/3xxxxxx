There is an nfo file in the Deviance folder with a key in it. Maybe that key works better?"

,kauken,2007-09-11T00:18Z,"oK. eftersom ingen orkar hjälpa folk så får väl jag göra det. puss o kram i rumpan.

1. Download the torrent

2. mount or burn image ( dont know how? read online, I use ""alcohol120%"" and still have no clue what it does, but read 5minutes online and seem to alwasy get it working)

3. Install the game from your mounted image ( this means that your computer thinks that you have the quake Cd inserted) 

4. Now it will ask you for the CD key, now use the keygenerator from: "" http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3735086/%5BPC%5D_Quake_IV_Keygen_%5Btukiman%5D ""     
AND BE SMART  dont use the first generated keys, sit a while and press the generate button so that u find an unused KEY combination, i sat for 4 minutes.

5. write the KEY and install just as if you would have bought the game in a store.
Remember to write down the key and save it somewhere AND write it down on a piece of paper also!

6. Ok, now you have the game installed on your computer, but the game is uncracked. Now you have to open the folder where you have the game installed ON YOUR COMPUTER, and also open ( or ""explore"" the folder where you have the game ""CD"" - the mounted game. 
Example: Open ""ID software/quake4"" folder on your computer, navigate to where the game file is ( ""quake4.exe"") - AND also open the E: or D: or F - where the mounted game is. Look for a folder named DEVIANCE and in there you find a game file named QUAKE4. This is the cracked file.

7. Copy the cracked quake4 file and paste or put it in the game folder on your computer so that it replaces the original quake4.exe file in ID softwares folder.

8. Since you written down the cd KEY  :) you can now start the game from the computer - they will ask you for the cd key u used when u installed - look at your paper and put it in ( obs! no spaces between the letters this time ) 

9. PLAY THE GAME....... AND THINK OF ME having sex with your mommy ;)

,hindersh,2007-11-08T16:55Z,but if you go to mininova>>forums>> and try to search for quake invalid cd-key or something
,SecretMan1983,2007-11-11T19:34Z,"Hey

The reason for all of your trouble with the CD key is , like Tincan told you guys, that you can't be connected to the internet.

Quake 4 automatically checks the CD-key which you enter, with their online authentication server, meaning that bogus keys (like those created by the keygen) won't be accepted.

The solution can be one of the following, depending on your knowledge of computers:

- Just block the programs internet access with any firewall. Quake4.exe should NOT be allowed internet access.

or

- Deactivate your entire internet connection through Control Panel -> Network Connections

or

- Simply unplug your internetcable

For this game to work, you will have to make certain that it doesn't have internet access each time you want to play it.

Obviously only the Single Player campaign can be played."

,decebal01us,2008-08-03T16:06Z,"you can play this great game in multiplayer to, its awesome, but you need 2 things to play online:

http://www.quakeunity.com/file=2482
