Sharing is Caring"
,motorhedge,2007-08-17T08:20Z,Thank you verymutch speedy download and great music!
,Axtin,2007-09-16T18:23Z,"Rammstein are NO nazists! They are so far from the right side of the political scale you can come!
By the way, they have made a song called ""Links 2 3 4"" wich means ""Left 2 3 4""."
,mordikia,2007-09-25T01:07Z,"the man above me is right, they wrote that song in response to what the person who wrote the first comment said. "
,asmariamoon,2007-10-06T00:58Z,"Why must everyone judge people based solely on outer appearance?  Just because someone is German, or listens to German music, that does not automatically make them a Nazi... The Nationalsozialistische Deutche Arbeiterpartie (National Socialist German Workers Party AKA Nazi Party) fell apart more than 60 years ago, so just stop using that word to place your poorly-conceived judgments on people."
,TamaraCORE,2008-02-13T16:10Z,"first: Ramstein is not a Nazi, Nazi means: National Socialists.
secondd: @Evil Banana: Duitsland is the Dutch way to write Deutschland or Germany.
third: For all people who call German people Nazi's. Ask a real Nazi what it is. I mean I don't call you name like: Communist or something?

Und Rammstein: Ihr Music is Hammer :) GruĂ&#x;e aus Holland :)"
,pantera6993,2008-02-14T02:56Z,"All you people who think Rammstein is Nazi are pretty much doing the same thing that other countries are saying about the Americans. Its pretty much racism because you are judging them because of their origin. You people that think that apparently havent listened to the music, you just looked it up to post a comment. Great waste of a day nerds.
GREAT TORRENT LUV IT!!"
,demon2469,2008-02-15T18:30Z,"Ok, let's get a few things straight from someone that actually knows what the hell they are talking about. 1) Till Lindemann IS a card carrying Nazi. I don't know for sure about the rest of the band but when I met Mr. Lindemann in a cafe in Munchen, Bayern, Deutschland (the CORRECT German spelling for Munich, Bavaria, Germany) I had a long interesting conversation with him. 2) The Nazi political is NOT dead, it's not even in a coma. It is alive and well. 3) Links 2 3 4 was NOT written to explain anything about anyone's ploitical views, it is an adaptation of a marching cadence used by the Bundeswehr (the German Army. literally translated Bundeswehr means Federal Defense) for years. How do I know all these things? It's actually quite simple my dear Watson. I am an American Soldier stationed in Schweinfurt, Germany. I have been here for a few years and have adapted nicely to the way the locals are and the culture here. I even learned a little German along the way (Mein Deutsch ist gut, ja?). Before spouting off your personal beliefs about anything as if they were written in stone gospel... check your facts. Oh and, PROST!!! (That means CHEERS right before you drink a HUGE friggen Hefe Weissen or Lager.)"

Bullshit, you live in America and have never even been to Germany.

As for the rest of you, shut up."
