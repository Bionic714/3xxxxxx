What is it about? The big difference with this cut is that there is no more Mr Lovett as played by Bill Paxton. The movie is strictly about Titanic, Rose & Jacks love story & that?s it.

Ok well much like my demonoid description, im not gonna be able to give an exact description of what was cut & or added due to nothing really being added or cut. The big difference with this cut is that there is no more Mr Lovett as played by Bill Paxton. The movie is strictly about Titanic, Rose & Jacks love story & that?s it. Although I enjoyed the subplot with Bill Paxton, it wasn?t what I?d call a dealbreaker for the movie, it would have been just as lovely without it. The Beginning is naturally different from that of the original due to having to cut out Mr Lovett but the rest was just pure magic, that shouldn?t be touched IMO ( although I did make a very few minor cuts here & there ).
