VLC needed to do an index repair, but after this it played fine. 

Thanks for the upload - might sit down and watch this today."
,tsec,2007-07-08T19:31Z,"It's not a bad film. All of a sudden I am in love with Stefania Rocca :)

I will seed for the next few days - from late evening until dawn EU time."
,jacquesketch,2007-07-08T21:04Z,"tsec, thanks. Seems its quite popular already. According to utorrent there's 41 peers and about 6 seeds. The direct download has done over a 150 gigs today too :)
"
,tsec,2007-07-08T21:40Z,"I couldnt get the direct download to work properly - it would always cease after doing 100-150MB - weird.

If you come across any more similar movies, please post torrents here. I kinda like this genre. :)

Cheers"
