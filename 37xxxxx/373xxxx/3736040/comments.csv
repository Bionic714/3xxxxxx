,Mizoik,2008-11-15T20:17Z,Can anyone play this on Windows Vista Ultimate 32bits?
,ssriblock,2008-12-13T12:49Z,If you get black screen after starting game go to folder where you have installed game and rename folder named AVI to _AVI. This disables in-game movies but it fixes black screen problem.
,Mizoik,2008-12-22T05:39Z,Is there any way to see in-game movies... Coze that thing with the AVI folder did the trick.
,156gbe56,2010-10-05T20:44Z,how do you install?

,PonyJL,2010-11-20T16:52Z,Like 99% of games you download you will need to get a program that can mount iso files such as Daemon tools.
