Dear INS community,

Four years ago, in the mind of Andrew "Argyll" Spearin, Insurgency was born. Since then, the team has grown, the mod has matured and our fan base has expanded. Today, after all the hard work our developers, community liaisons and testers have put in, with both Pongles and I leading the way, we can finally say: It's ready.

We have put you, our loyal community, through a lot of ups and downs. While our development side was doing great, our PR side was lacking. It was a roller coaster ride just trying to get the mod to this point. A lot of crazy things happened that we can't really explain, but led to huge internal misunderstandings. It is no one's fault but our own and we have learned from this and many other mistakes. You can be rest assured to see many Insurgency updates in the future, where the mod should progress quite impressively over time, along with the development team's level of professionalism and its ability to cater to its community as well.

The entire development process of this mod was an amazing learning experience for all of us and we are confident when we say we are better at this now than we were at the beginning. I'm quite confident that you all will appreciate the fruits of our labor, and we look forward to playing with you guys on the server and hearing your feedback!
