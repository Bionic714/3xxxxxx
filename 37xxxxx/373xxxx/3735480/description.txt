Overview:	The cock-eyed crime-busters from My Lucky Stars take a break in Thailand after triumphing in their previous case. Their vacation is cut short when they have to rush back to Hong Kong as they learn that Thai assassins are on the way to kill a Hong Kong drug lord. This lunatic action comedy from HK action slapstick master Sammo Hung contains plenty of good fight sequences, plenty of silly but hilarious comedy and plenty of girl chasing by the crimebusting clowns. Michelle Yeoh does a cameo appearance, and performs her first onscreen fight against Sammo Hung. Sammo really delivers in this one; The end fight sequence is a lot of fun.
