Nice overclocking utility, read the details for it here: www.immiersoft.com

This utility is great for people who really push thier windows mobile unit to its limits. It also makes for a much smoother and faster experience while going through your unit's menus. 
   
   This utility is a MUST have for everyone though, because not only can you OVER clock your unit, (and ruin your battery life) you can UNDER clock it as well adding hours to your battery life. 

 This utility also has a feature that auto scales your cpu speed, ramping it up when your using it, and dropping it down when your not.
