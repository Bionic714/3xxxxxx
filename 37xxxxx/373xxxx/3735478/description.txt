The Rebellious Reign (1980)

HKFlix Says:  	4 Stars

The fights are better than they have any right to be, including some nice moves and special effects that you don't see too often. However, the entire middle of the film is bogged down with slow-paced and unnecessary exposition.

Avg. Rating: 	
  4.1 / 5 (based on 4 ratings).

Plot:	Jimmy Lee (AKA Lung Fong) is Nie Kan Yao, the true life Ming patriot who nearly brought down the Ching rule singlehandedly. Without doubt one of the best kung fu films ever made. Breathtaking choreography from "The King Of Flash", Alan Hsu.

Overview:	This brilliant kung fu film was originally written for Bruce Lee to star in. However, after his tragic death in 1973, the project was shelved until 1980, when former Bruce Lee director Lo Wei revamped the project and thrust a new Lee--Jimmy Lee--into the starring role of Nie Kan Yao, the true life Ming patriot who nearly brought down the Ching rule singlehandedly. Without doubt one of the best kung fu films ever made. Breathtaking choreography from "The King Of Flash", Alan Hsu.
