[T],stevekasian,2007-07-11T02:45Z,"Does this pack include ""buffer terrain""? I've been seeing some FSGenesis 150m and 300m buffer terrain *elsewhere* lately, but there's so much of it and it's all broken up into like 50 RS filez that'll take years to DL, so I'd rather not if this will work out the same.

Tnx

,montyburns70,2007-07-11T10:59Z,"Thank you, 4X-AXG! All your uploads are top notch! I hate being one of those guys 'requesting', I would just like to know if you consider bringing up the FS9 version too..."

[T],stevekasian,2007-07-12T04:04Z,"Hey Bowden: could you, by chance, invite my ass then?  It says registrations are clozed. Tnx."
,montyburns70,2007-07-12T08:19Z,"Yes, pointing to Demonoid for the FS9 version is not really helpful for those who aren't registered there. Registrations are closed."
