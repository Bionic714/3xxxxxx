,Sjakiesjaak,2007-07-10T09:44Z,"I downloaded it and there if I want to extract the fm.2007.lucil it says: no archives found.

What to do now??

Is it fake or not??"
,Sjakiesjaak,2007-07-10T09:49Z,"It does work you don't have to extract the fm.2007.lucil. You just mount the image.

Mostly you have to extract that kind of files so I thought I had to do that."
,lucil,2007-07-10T13:52Z,"I didn't archive it, cos i always find it anoying to extract the files. I did make a sfv file tho, so u can confirm ur iso's not damaged."

,selle_mogge,2007-07-15T23:19Z,"You need something called daemon tools to mount a image file.
You can download it on the internet."

,fisk3n,2007-09-14T11:08Z,"It's that weird on the original too (I havent tried this one yet but i know that the FM 07 Editor is weird). try to update and then you will have the newest editor and files but it will say that you have an earlier version with the crack.(Before you update FM 07 put in the original game files for FM 07, and move or rename the crack for now and after the update yust put in the crack again and voila you have an updated game.)"
