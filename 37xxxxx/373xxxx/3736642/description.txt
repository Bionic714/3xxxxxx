I present to you the 1st chapter of Saigado's "Hana's Holiday."  It's not the most graphic H-manga around; in fact, Saigado did some creative censoring in certain panels for this chapter and there is heavy censoring in other chapters.  Still, it's a fun read IMHO.

Please enjoy and look forward to the rest!

Oh!  And many thanks in advance to those who help seed!
