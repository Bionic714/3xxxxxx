   Ever since the cease fire of the Korean War of the 1950's, an uneasy peace
   had existed on the Korean peninsula. As the Cold War grew in intensity
   through the 60's & 70's, the position of the two sides became increasingly
   strained. By the mid 80's, both sides were armed and ready to do battle
   once more. It would only take one incident in the world to trigger a new
   Korean War, one that would be fought with guided weapons and attack
   helicopters. With events in Europe carrying the course of history in
   unexpected directions, the time for a new Korean War has arrived.
