,MKL0099,2007-08-02T01:11Z,"I'm trying to find the Marty Robbins song ""A Man and a Train"". It's from the movie Emperor of the North but there was no sound track. Wiki says it's on is album All-Time Greatest Hits (Catalog# 77425), and the CD The Best of Marty Robbins released by Curb Records in January 2006, both including a second verse not used in the film.

Any help finding it would be appreciated..."
