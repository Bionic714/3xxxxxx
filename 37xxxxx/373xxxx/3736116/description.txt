TPB Hosts Helper is a small app that adds the ip-adresses (21) of The Pirate Bay to your hosts file. Good if you cant trust your ISP's DNS-information. May fix problems from your ISP trying to block TPB. http://thepiratebay.org/blog -> Censorship rumour

Intended for users who dont want/can change their own hosts file.



Enjoy!
