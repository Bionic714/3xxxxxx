Cowboy Bebop Complete anime.
the anime consists of 26 episodes.

Its about 4 bounty hunters traveling the universe in their ship looking for bountys and struggles to survive from day to day.
Its a bit seventies/eighties over it but not in a way that it disturbs.
Very good anime well worth seeing.
