Sea turtles are one of the animal kingdom's great survivors, having been on the 
planet for over 100 million years. But the threat of egg poachers, tourism and 
fishing is risking their future. 

In the eighth Saving Planet Earth celebrity expedition, Saira Khan travels to Sri 
Lanka, home to five different species of turtle, to see the cause of the problems 
and to witness some amazing community work which is offering hope for the 
animals' survival. 

Many turtles feed in exactly the same waters where fishermen cast their nets. It 
is estimated that more than 50,000 marine turtles are killed each year in 
South-East Asia and the South Pacific, with commercial fishing the main cause. 

Saira visits an area still recovering from the destruction of the Boxing Day 
tsunami in 2005, and understands why, for many here, turtle conservation is not a 
priority. She meets a local fisherman who has recently been fined nine months' 
wages for stealing turtle eggs. Learning that he took the eggs to feed his 
pregnant wife, she chokes back her tears, saying: "I feel really sad. I don't 
feel angry at him at all. He's a really poor guy and he's got a pregnant wife and 
she wanted something to eat, and he just did what he thought was right for his 
family ... I don't think he understands why it's wrong to do that and I think 
that's the trouble." 

However, the project has helped many of the local people turn from turtle 
poachers to turtle protectors, allowing them to make a living as tour guides 
while safeguarding the turtles and their nesting grounds. 

Thanks to one of the local guides, Saira witnesses the sight of baby turtles 
hatching on the beach, breaking their way through the sand and making their way 
into the ocean. 

A ┬ú10 donation to the BBC Wildlife Fund could pay for a team co-ordinator for the 
Turtle Conservation Project for three days.
