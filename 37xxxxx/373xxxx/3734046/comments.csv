2001 seems most likely. No guarantee that this is the right movie, but here's the IMDB link:

Another possibility is this one from 1987, though it seems a bit less likely:

Finally, IMDB lists about 15 films with this exact title. None of them seem probable, but here a link to the list, just in case:

Be nice if you gave us a little more info, Pollson.
