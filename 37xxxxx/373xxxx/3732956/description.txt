That's right, bitches, it's the 1991 blockbuster megahit starring Vanilla Ice in his first ever motion picture role, and also featuring Kristin Minter and Michael Gross (of Family Ties fame).

Unavailable on DVD and near impossible to find by P2P, the only way I was able to obtain this gem of a film was by buying a burned DVD that was lovingly bootlegged from the laserdisc release.

Oh god, it's horrible. It's like watching a train wreck, but a million times worse.

Key quotes that essentially define the movie:
"Drop that zero, and get with the hero."
"I'm gonna go over there and, uh, schling a schlong."

Holy fuck. He said both of those lines with a straight face. How the hell did he do that? Vanilla Ice has never produced a better film performance than the one in Cool as Ice. He's truly a god among early '90s white rappers that made movies.

If you've watched a few episodes of Pee-Wee's Playhouse, you're already familiar with the quality of acting, direction, and set design you'll find in this movie.

This mind-blowing remake of Rebel Without a Cause is truly an experience.

1.5/4 stars. Watch this movie.

In half-seriousness, for such a terrible movie, some of the cinematography is actually quite decent. This movie is a bit of a guilty pleasure for me. It's terrible, but still entertaining. The cheese factor is high but that's what makes it so great. I actually do recommend you to at least watch it once. Preferably with a solid beer buzz.
