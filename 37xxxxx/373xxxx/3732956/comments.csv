,voltsin,2010-03-24T13:10Z,"Thanks very much for the torrent!  I actually really enjoyed this movie when I was younger, & watched it many times.  Looking forward to watching it again, but somehow I think it won't be as good as I remember.

Too bad this is fullscreen, but it's better than nothing :-)"
