This is the FULL version of \\\"Hotel\\\" - !!!EXTREMELY RARE!!!

Here\\\'s a part on youtube that I\\\'ve found

You can compare this movie to Mr. Bean but these guys made this movie back in 1982!

IF YOU LIKE TO LAUGH THEN DOWNLOAD NOW!


Length is about 35 minutes and it\\\'s a good VHS-rip
totally watchable and good sound but I noticed that the video size is acting weird. I can play it perfect in Winamp but the video size will look different in WMP. For you who\\\'s got the time I recommend converting it to Xvid or something.

If someone got a \\\"cleaner\\\" version it would be great!



Please post comments too so everyone knows what this is!
