Looking forward to playing it!!!"
,xxXG-UnotXxx,2007-08-18T04:24Z,there's no need to install just open up the folder and double-click on the gta3.exe file and that will start the game 
,Johnthethird,2007-08-18T18:04Z,"OK, thanks. I got it working but is there any way I can add in the radio stations?"

,Devils_Dime,2007-08-31T04:58Z,"Thanks for the upload, works great, great new cars and weapons."
,xxXG-UnotXxx,2007-09-01T01:38Z,"I've got no idea why it can't move, but instead of moving the mp3s just leave them where they are at and just put shortcuts in the mp3 folder"
,sace682000,2007-09-09T04:32Z,this will sound stupid but i cant follow how you add mp3s tot he game. i followed the link you put and it installed. but where do i put the mp3s at? in the audio folder from the gta game? please help. other than that it loaded up great
,xxXG-UnotXxx,2007-09-12T06:01Z,"well the link was a program you use to extract the file you downloaded (Grand Theft Auto III+RealGTA3.Ready to Play.( New Cars).rar) which has nothing to do with the mp3s. Put your mp3s in the folder named ""mp3"" NOT in the ""audio"" folder. After that start the game, get into a car and change the radio station to ""MP3"""
,xxXG-UnotXxx,2007-09-12T06:02Z,Have fun and SEED when finished

,xxXG-UnotXxx,2007-09-20T02:02Z,"maybe your PC is too old to handle this game, either that or Windows is messed up and you have to reinstall or fix it
Try looking at this: http://www.techspot.com/vb/topic15393.html"
,ixlikextoxdansex,2007-09-22T10:18Z,PLEASE SEED. this is slow as fuck
,ixlikextoxdansex,2007-09-22T12:07Z,"In case you wanted to know before you download:
1. this DOES work
2.its simple, and theres no installing. simply extract the files, click on the gta3 icon, and your're playing the game. it's ""plug n play"", so to speak, and it works perfectly. You WILL NOT regret downloading this.
3. The mp3 thing works good also, just put mp3 files in the mp3 folder, and listen to them on the mp3 station in the game. simple.

i will be seeding this for a long time, i'm so glad i have it. thanks!!!!!!!"

,xxXG-UnotXxx,2008-01-27T02:13Z,try it again. It might be your PC thats too old or something. Since it has some high quality textures it needs a good PC to run. Also try setting ur pc to 16 bit high color mode. Hope it helps. ps- I don't speak Swedish

===============================================================================

Explanation of asteriks marked cars:				
Seperately added cars (F355, Diablo, Prowler) can't have their own handling,
they have to use handling of existing cars. But the new cars need their
own handling, so I found cars (Bellyup, Panlantic, Blista) that can use
some other's car handling and I used their rows in handling.cfg for the added
cars' handling! So, watch out for default.ide, it's harder to modify it now!"

,xxXG-UnotXxx,2008-04-07T01:08Z,There is absolutely no viruses in here it is just a your antivirus making false accusations. GTA3 is weird about running on some PCs try upgrading your video card drivers.  YEs extract the RAR and double-click on gta3.exe to start.  And this is the original game same missions with REAL cars and some new textures and I think that it also has the Statue of Liberty

,daveyjones1111,2008-11-14T01:33Z,The only thing that turns me off from this release is the fact that all the trees have been turned into palm trees... what the hell.
,nait2k4,2008-11-28T04:27Z,"Just in the process of downloading this, quick question, is the MOD installed already? 
I have not played GTA3 since buying it on PS2 about 6 years ago, wanted to play through the original game before using the mod. 
If it is installed, am I able to uninstall it/install it at will? 
Or am I better off grabbing an ISO and the mod separately?

Cheers for the Upload, feedback seems damn positive. (Apart from the usual ""ew virus scream"" and ""i didnt read0r ur instructionz and nw gam3 w0nt runorzx!@@#&@!&&!&111"")"

Please reply, Thanks."

,diablo9333,2011-06-19T15:42Z,Im getting pretty fast speeds...I don't know why everyone is complaining. I have fast internet so I will seed. Im getting about 400kb/s not the usual speed I get(1.0 mb) but it will do. 
,diablo9333,2011-06-19T16:24Z,Anyone else have mouse issues or is it suppose to have terrible mouse controls? I can only turn part-way using mouse and it kinda destroys gameplay. For example my guy runs kinda sideways because I cannot move the mouse any further. Is that meant to happen? Classic controls work fine it is Standard that has the problem. I don't like Classic imo. 
,CopiusPNG,2011-10-12T21:03Z,How can i get hold of full radio and music installs?
