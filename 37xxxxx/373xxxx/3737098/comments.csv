,LiverpoolTilliDie,2007-07-10T13:06Z,Is this the game or the upgrade... i need both
,LiverpoolTilliDie,2007-07-10T13:08Z,i think its the upgrade because its only 52.17 MB ;) but do you now where i can find the game too download?
,trajjob,2007-07-10T15:11Z,"This is simply a no-cd patch, not an installation nor an upgrade."
,lessthantag,2007-07-19T08:03Z,doesn't seem to be working for me? ?
,trajjob,2007-07-20T18:09Z,"well, you are the first one who has experienced that. have you done as i described above? do you have Full install of expansion? when you've installed it once, you need to press something like ""more options"" underneath the ""play diablo 2 expansion"" link. in there you will have an option to upgrade and you will need the lod disc.

describe your problem if this isn't helping"
,kyp0001,2007-07-20T23:55Z,thx for the file :]
,Deamandread,2007-07-24T12:56Z,"Keep getting this when i start the game:

""We got a big error :(""


is this some kind of joke?"
,trajjob,2007-07-28T11:53Z,"it says so when it cannot start or when you get an error... you probably don't have the ""upgraded installation"""
,metal_gudinna,2007-08-15T01:48Z,I have the upgraded installation of lord of destruction and I still get the very annoying error message. i've done exactly what you've written here and it just wont work
,masterj1337,2007-08-26T05:17Z,"umm it doesnt work i dont see anything called more options i upgraded form multi to full and..well it says please enter the disc labeld expansion and retry

,zarlok,2007-09-02T03:50Z,"Why the fuck does this say ""tsiuay university"" for company or whatever the fuck it says? This smells like trojan/virus."
,amalbis2k,2007-09-17T18:34Z,ive also followed ur instructions and upgraded from multi to full but it keeps on displaying the fucking message. THIS DOESN'T WORK...DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS BULLSHIT!!! PUTANGINA MO!!!!

,okqueen,2008-07-07T21:38Z,"This torrent is the D2xMusic.MPQ file, which is what you need in yuor Diablo II folder in order to run the game without the CD. This only works if you have a full install, and if you've already upgraded to 1.11 or 1.12. The patch can be found on the battle.net website. "
,cool1cole,2008-07-20T05:45Z,"U torrent isnt working for me, it keeps on stopping all the LOD torrents. I have tried many different but it just wont work"
,xahelus,2009-01-23T06:49Z,"When it says the ""We got  big problem here :("" thing, I downloaded this and it did not work, so I did some digging, and found out that you have to make sure that you have the correct patch 1.11b,  not 1.0, not 1.11, but specifically 1.11b, if you don't, this will not work.  It's not very specific when it says the 'big problem here' bit, but for me it meant the crack was for version 11.1b, and I had 1.08 (I think, i can't remember) so you need to either get a version for the patch you have, or update it to 1.11b

Hope this helps."
,penguinscock,2011-05-02T14:46Z,the music file is good but the diablo II.exe is the thing causing the error...
