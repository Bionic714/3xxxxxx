,ubercam,2007-07-25T04:22Z,"BEWARE!!!

This might have a virus. On a brand new XP install, the very first thing I ran was NOD32 install and I got a virus, so WATCH OUT. Don't say I didn't warn you.

The only reason I'm not 100% certain which torrent it was I downloaded is because it was yesterday on a different machine."
