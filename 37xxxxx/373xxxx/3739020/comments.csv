,jimmy154,2010-01-07T02:22Z,"Will this cracked version work with a Passat MK5 and an ""ebay"" cable?  The cable states it does not work with the Passat MK5, but I'm not sure if that is because the vag com software requires a licensed cable for this model car, which this crack is able to work around.  Does any one know if the cracked software lets me use an ""ebay"" cable on a car the ""ebay"" cable would otherwise not work on?"
