The most important city in Iraq is not Baghdad and you have probably never heard it mentioned on the 10 o'clock news. It is mentioned over 300 times in the Bible (and it is even mentioned three times in the family tree of our Lord Jesus Christ!) This is, of course, the fabled Babylon. It was founded by the first world dictator, Nimrod, and it may well be destined to be the capital of the final world dictator, commonly called the Antichrist! And this may all be emerging on our near horizon.
