,OttifantSir,2010-04-12T16:07Z,"deksar: What I believe flapdoos meant, and this is my position too, is that you should see this movie before agreeing to marry a muslim man to get the ugly side of Islam too. In theory, Islam is the most peaceful monotheistiv religion in the world. Problem is, history and recent event events show us that too many muslims don't really practice Islam the correct way, but are stuck in the old ways of the nomad tribes of the Arabic world. And then masquerading it as religion. For the nomads, this might have been necessary, but today it is an archaic practice and not compatible with the rest of the world, or even Islam.

No, I'm not a member of either Judaism, Christianity, Islam or any large religion. I'm agnostic and I have read the Tora, Talmud, Bible and Quran. And I can't see how the text in these books can be so interpreted as to mean that Jahve, God, Allah or anyone meant to give someone the power to restrict the rights and freedoms of others. What these books say is basically The Golden Rule: Do unto others as you want others to do unto you. And respect that there are something larger, more powerful than you in this world. Religion teaches that there are (a) God(s), others believe like me that religion has it wrong.

I do however respect other people's right to think for themselves and believe in one god or many or none. As long as they don't force their view of the world on me through legislation or hipocracy. Practice what you preach, and I'll respect you. If bin Laden had planned the 9/11 attacks AND participated in them, I'd respect his conviction in his view, if not the action. However, sending brainwashed people to do the job for you is just simply cowardice.

So, watch this movie and realise that not all muslim men are like the man in this movie, but also realise that this man isn't the absolute worst muslim man. You don't even have to be muslim to be as bad or worse than this man. Psychopaths like this man exist in every walk of life, so women should take this story to heart for every man they fall in love with."
,dashark889,2010-09-23T04:55Z,To Ottifant Sir:  I literally just made an account to comment on your comment and I just wanted to say well done.  That is probably one of the most well written respectable standpoints on religion I have ever read.

,newbrownshoe,2011-03-08T13:35Z,"otti - i look at 'comments' to see that the movie works, or programs have no viruses, not to hear your dribble....or to give thanks to the uploader. ""Thanks lordimotep"". Who cares what your views are. ""Not all muslim men are like this muslim man"" you say, but enough are. Just look at the Muslim world, and see how they treat their own. 'WE' may not be perfect, but shit, I'd prefer the western way anyday. Now go fuck a camel."
