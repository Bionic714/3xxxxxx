,jw2501,2007-09-29T01:00Z,"yeah, what do I put for machine number?!"
,jw2501,2007-09-29T06:58Z,"Never mind, I got it.  Once installed, click the about button on the Tracktion home screen.  The machine number is listed there for you to enter into keygen"

,garyprimer,2008-08-02T01:58Z,Avira identifies trojan in keygen.
,GunMetal125,2008-09-20T01:30Z,"Program installed fine. But when I try to run the keygen it come up with this error:

""Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item.""

I tried downloading from multiple sources and it all comes up with the same thing. I also made sure the keygen was made for the correct version of the software. Can anyone help?"
,Crazi.Amigo,2008-09-29T06:19Z,"@ gunmetal125,
it says that because the keygen is a trojan."
,kogoshiix,2009-07-27T17:39Z,"you morons, it looks like a trojan to most WEAK scanners because it's a KEYGEN but it's not a trojan, it gets mistaken because it generates code automatically to u, similar to a trojan except trojans generate code and info to the maker instead of just to you. LEARN HOW TO PROBABLY SCAN AND CHECK SHIT MORONS"
