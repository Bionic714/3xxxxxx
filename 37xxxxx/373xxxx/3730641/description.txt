Buzz Ballads is a compilation album of alternative rock ballads. It was released in 2006 by Razor & Tie. Fans of 1990s and early-2000s alternative rock will immediately recognize many of the songs on this 2006 collection. From Live's highly emotive "Lightning Crashes" to Bush's melancholy "Glycerine" to Hole's sullen "Doll Parts," BUZZ BALLADS offers up one gloriously angst-ridden, down-tempo song after another, making it the perfect compilation to accompany a bad mood.
