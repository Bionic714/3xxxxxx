,prod,2007-09-17T14:04Z,"Hey, can we all seed a bit more after getting this! Great torrent, nice to see someone go to the effort of collating and uploading nearly 60 GIGS to get the whole series together.

I'll seed until January, please help others get this by seeding after you've finished :) thanks"
,smidio,2007-09-21T15:43Z,"help me help me

I cant open these movies 
what program or codec do i need??"
,prod,2007-09-23T14:53Z,@smidio: Use VLC media player. It's free - google it.
,e_WRX,2007-09-26T02:41Z,Thanks to those that are seeding esp. prod!
,smidio,2007-09-27T16:25Z,"Thanks for seeding everybode keep seeding
I still have trouble opening these movies
the first episode(arrival of radditz) works fine with vlc-player but all the other movies only work for 9 seconds and then it gets all weard!! Is it maybe because the download is at 42%? or are the files maybe corrupt or something like that. Who can help me!! "
,reeged,2007-09-30T04:22Z,smidio...if you havent finished downloading the files you obviously cant watch everything. Fuckin hell use your brain man!!
,smidio,2007-09-30T13:46Z,those episodes that are already finisched downloading they don't work either smartass
,DevonHartigan,2007-10-02T18:21Z,"Smidio, as Reeged said, use your fucking brain instead of spamming with stupid questions. Bittorrent programs don't download the separate files progressively, completely. Sometimes you can watch most of the files in the beginning of the torrent without major problems, as a major part of these tend to get downloaded first, but this doesn't mean that they are complete. Have some freaking patience and wait till it's god damn finished.
They are not finished just because you can start them in your media player!"
,smidio,2007-10-02T19:32Z,"quess i'l have to wait then 
Thanks for the info DevonH"
,DevonHartigan,2007-10-05T22:26Z,No problem.

,Slayer1040,2007-10-26T00:19Z,wow who is stupid enough to upload a 60 gig torrent... what a fucking idiot
,DevonHartigan,2007-10-28T13:04Z,"STFU Slayer! Just because your connection speed is as puny as your dick, it doesn't mean that others with connection speeds as huge as their gargantuan cocks don't appreciate the hard work it takes to make such a great torrent available.

Mike18xx you rock!"
,mike18xx,2007-11-07T08:12Z,"60gb is too small, so I've decided to also upload a 127gb 30-DVDfull torrent as well."

,jasonbir,2007-11-30T07:46Z,"Not going to d/l this torrent, not a fan, but just would like to thank you on behalf of the downloaders, who just seem to bitch and moan about things they don't understand. I gotta remember the ""do the human genome a favor"" one :D"
,DaMadBoy,2007-12-04T15:53Z,"For all people experiencing slow downloads. Did you know that torrents have a system that if you upload a small amount or nothing at all you download speed will be very slow but if we all set our upload speed to at least 25Kbps we will all get a good download speed. So if you want to spend weeks downloading this file then please continue leeching but if you want it fast put your upload speed up. If you don't, don't bother complaining on here about you getting a slow download speed because it's your own fault."
,Shaflugi,2007-12-05T00:46Z,"Can anybody tell me what format this is in? I'm hoping I can stream this to my 360, and unfortunately "".avi"" doesn't say much :).

No; ""stupid"" is someone who'd rather download 30gb of shit quality instead of 60gb of excellent quality.

Dumbass iPod motherfuckahs...."
,spud1984,2007-12-28T15:07Z,mike18xx the up load you have done is grate if people upload more the size would't be a problem the peek download speed is bout 70kb/s and when its like that it would only take 3weeks but most of the time it downloads at 3kb/s no one is sharing so the download time is aprox 2.4years people are moning to about the size of the file when they should mone to the people that are downloading and not uploading there the ones that are make his brill download take so long thanks alot torrent users for making this a slow and painfull download

Again, many thanks for this :D"
,Rob93,2008-01-03T01:39Z,"mike18xx-

Thanks man. I don't upload torrents myself, as I have nothing that wouldn't be a repeat. What I do though, is after I download something, I make sure to seed until I've shared at least 3-4X the torrents total size. 

Assuming this is all good, I'll seed this one until I die!

,walkwithbeast,2008-01-29T07:39Z,"i think its wastage of time to download 59 gb rather u can get these only in 9 gb.

every episode is in real media format (not more than 40 mb per episode) n quality is quite good.

1. website for episodes link http://www.satancity.net/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=2459

2. register

3. links will be enabled to megaupload but it has limitation to remove it.. download megaupload toolbar

4. you can download simply by browser else there is usdownloader application which supports more than 100 of share download sites. link to usd http://www.wincert.net/forum/index.php?s=2bf51773f7d06e0465176242dc88aa4a&showtopic=1065

enjoy!!!!!!!

please post comments."
,XxAuthorityCorruptsxX,2008-01-30T02:41Z,"just so you guys know...a faster way to download this, is to skip all but a few,,,then after their done, watch them!!! and download a few more (by left clicking where it says skip, under the priority column) ,,,,this way you can watch some of them...its also faster, it focuses on the 'high' instead of the 'skip' ones..., also instead of trying to download all of them at the same time...much faster believe me"

I see other peers downloading at 150-200kbs and up... with less uploaded?.. and my upload speed is at 40kbs and up half the time. When I lowered my Upload rate my download rate dropped even lower all the way to 10kbs... That's unfair.

,KingVegeta,2008-03-27T22:24Z,78.7% Done. What I don't understand is what made them come up with dragonball GT... It had nothing to do with the orignal story line and it sucked big time. The only people that like GT is those who know nothing about DB / Z Until GT aired / meaning those who know nothing about Dragonball up until now..I feel they screwed over the true fans of db/z
,KJFS,2008-03-29T01:10Z,I thought GT was really boring as well. All the flying around in space with both Goku and Pan always whining and shouting. The only good part was the battle against the last dragon. And when Goku and Vegeta got to Super Saiyan 4. And then FUSION!! Really great:)
,KJFS,2008-03-29T01:12Z,"This torrent is, by the way, of really great quality both sound and picture, worth the waiting.
Tip: Dont download all at once, just pick out 20 or 30 episodes each time, so u can watch the first ones while u wait for the others."

,headshot1982,2008-06-11T11:20Z,"Well after getting to about episode 54, I noticed the dubbing group/voice actors must have been switched, as well as MOST of the audio. Guess the first 53 or so was the ocean group dub? Pitty, after listening to a bit of both groups, I'm rather sorry to see that ocean  group got replaced. In my opinion much better cast, and the voices didn't sound so faked. 

I hope I'm not the only one who thinks the funimation dub sounds horrible in comparison to the ocean dub. I mean the only character who's voice improved if you ask me is goku. Hell I even liked the narrator more from the ocean dub.

Anyways, disapointment aside (mostly with how bad funimation is), great torrent. About 44% done... but thats in like 2 months of downloading.... and yet I see people here finish in 1-2 weeks..."
,headshot1982,2008-06-11T11:21Z,"Forgot to mention that the music got switched around too with the changing of the dub groups. If you ask me, the funimation stuff just doesn't make the situation tense like the ocean group tracks did. Anyway, thats my 2 cents in the matter."

,Lloyd1337,2008-07-05T23:02Z,"I will agree that the funimation dub is pretty bad in that both the quality of the voice acting sounds bad, and the overall sound quality is worse as well (sounds like it was recorded with cheap microphones in someone's house instead of an actual studio).

However, I like the later episodes better for two reasons:
1. They don't use silly euphemisms for death such as ""another dimension."" In the first 53 episodes, they don't talk about death at all. It's lame and childish.
2. Is it just me, or did anyone laugh out loud when Vegeta proclaimed that he was a ""friggen genius""? At least the funimation dubs are more humorous.

Also, I have a question for people: does anyone know of a free media player that can play these files at an increased playback speed (say, 1.5x) without the audio pitch being increased?
The pacing for this show is terrible (Vegeta said Goku would take an hour to recover after fighting Ginyu, but apparently 1 hour = 13 episodes), and I honestly don't have time to watch all 291 epsiodes when it takes them 4 episodes to charge a friggen attack. I wanna be able to fast forward through all of the filler without missing anything.
I've been using MPlayer to watch them at 1.5x speed, but the pitch is increased, so it sounds funny and some of the speech is incomprehensible. I've also tried VLC Player and Media Player Classic, but they don't seem to support this feature either. I basically want something with the same capabilities as the playback speed slider in Windows Media Player, but that works with these AVI files.

Other than that, this is a great torrent, mike18xx. Very nostalgic. I will seed for as long as I can when done, although I'm only at 41.5% now (I'm downloading sequentially so I can watch episodes while it downloads)."

i noticed that this torrent went really fast during the peak hours of the day. keep in mind that the more you're uploading the faster you download. You're essentially helping yourself by uploading to your peers/client because in turn it raises the availability level of the file...i didn't leave my computer on for a week straight though... as i'm typing this im at 98.7 % going at about 180kb/s at 1:44pm with an ETA of 2hrs.

thanks for this torrent...i've been reading some of the comments ppl have left...i feel sorry for some of these computer illiterate dumbasses who constantly leave complaints on here about how its taken them a year to download and how the file is too big ..wah wah learn to use the program you d/l torrents with then come talk to me...otherwise don't bad-mouth this torrent because you'll only look like a retard.

If I control my upload speed and bring it down, somtimes, my download speed will reach as far as 1.3MB.S, NO BULL...

So stop telling others that the upload speed and control has absolutly no effect on the download speed because your WRONG... Dead WRONG...

There are two versions. The Funi versions does have the first season of Ocean in it though. The Ocean Group dub was distributed to Canada, UK and Australia. Funi is the American only version.

I live in Canada so I grew up with the Ocean dub. I can't stand the funi dub. Half way through the frieza saga, Vegeta's voice gets all crappy. Funi dub overall just has bad voice acting compared to the Ocean dub."

And I also noticed that there arent many torrents out there for the DBGT series any leads?

,richsar,2009-04-02T16:04Z,"theCalmKingdomofAudacity when you download the torrent file and b4 you open it up in your torrent client ( I use Utorrent ) you should be able to select the files...either that or once you have started your download go through the files and ""right click"" on the ones you don't want and select ""don't download""...I think that should be what your after :P"

,Verkew,2009-05-26T05:51Z,"I remember downloading this torrent over a year ago. Just stopping by to say thanks again and I hope it doesn't die, the seed/leech ratio is still bad as ever. Totally worth the download though, having all the DBZ episodes on your computer in good quality is nice."
,Roky12345,2009-05-31T21:07Z,"iSanzee: XD Nice comment, I agree with you.

I've seeded more then 500GB+, now let me tell you:
Roky12345's Guide To Downloading This Really Faster For Dummies ^^

DON'T Download this WHOLE thing at once(like iSanzee said).
An even better way is this: Downloading smaller doses at a time, NOT like iSanzee said, cause U're still downloading from the same torrent witch has 100 seeders and 3000+ leechers (cause it's a BIG A** torrent). BUT raither download 2gb archives at a time, witch have A LOT more seeders.

Once again: 
-60gb archives= a tiny spec of seeders
-2gb archives= a lot MORE seeders & ofc better ratio

So download every episode from 001 to 122 from these torrent, and from there on download all the others from hare using iSanzee GREAT tutorial:

,BigBasstud,2012-01-20T09:26Z,"Is this the 16:9 remastered version by FUN?
