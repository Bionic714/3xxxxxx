Seeding ~400kb/s at the moment. Enjoy :)"
,tripper511,2009-07-18T17:41Z,the movie is titled as episode 23.5 but its actually 22.5 since the bounty hunter show still exists in the movie.
,owns_1,2009-08-10T09:56Z,"@tripper511

Dude, shut the fuck up.  When you encode a ton of vids, create a torrent and seed it long enough to get it going, then you have the right to nitpick everything for the slightest error.  Grow up."
,nymersic,2010-02-09T08:03Z,"@owns1
The poor tripper guy just stated a fucking fact.  Jesus Christ.  Perhaps there's some idiot out there who finds it important to fix the ""error"" for himself.  Who the hell knows?  Let people point out discrepancies.  It's not that big of a fuckin' deal.  I'm sure he appreciates mike's work. 
Man, some people..."
,mike18xx,2010-02-21T13:54Z,"Well, I'm not about to re-upload 9 gigs just to fix a single alphanumeric character -- that's for sure.

....I actually thing the series ""views better"" in the order I have listed, however. ""Brain Scratch"" is just kinda dull and depressing...arguably most fans' least favorite episode of the series, and the movie serves as a good break point before ""Hard Luck Woman"" (one of the best eps), and the slam-bang two-part finale."
,lazytubs,2010-07-12T01:32Z,what are these ripped from? the remixed dvds?
,Jon55,2010-08-19T21:41Z,"Yikes, video quality is terrible. Looks like it was ripped from a VHS recording, and on top of that everything is way too dark. The audio quality is great, but in no way makes up for this shitty video quality."
