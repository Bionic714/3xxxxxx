Windows TinyXP Rev06

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for trying TinyXP Rev06.

To install TinyXP from this CD, set your PC in
the BIOS to boot from your CD-ROM drive.

Only install this operating system onto a freshly formatted
partition or hard disk. There is no upgrade option available,
because the option is removed. You do not need any product
key in this release - the installation of TinyXP is unattended,
apart from in the very beginning where you choose which
drive or partition to install to.

All installations are set to US English.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you boot from this CD you have seven options:

1 - TinyXP With IE/OE/MSN/WMP (With Drivers)
2 - TinyXP With IE/OE/MSN/WMP (Without Drivers)
3 - TinyXP Without IE/OE/MSN/WMP (With Drivers)
4 - TinyXP Without IE/OE/MSN/WMP (Without Drivers)
5 - Boot Into Acronis Backup + Restore
6 - Boot Into Hirens Boot CD
7 - Boot Into Damn Small Linux

Abbreviations from above:

IE -----> Internet Explorer 7 Web Browser
OE -----> Outlook Express Email Client
MSN ----> Windows Live Messenger 8
WMP ----> Windows Media Player 11

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All four installations of TinyXP include the following items,
these are all automatically installed along with Windows:

Service Pack 2
119 Hotfixes Up To 16.02.2007
DirectX DLL Libraries (24 to 31)
Segoe UI Vista Font
Flash Player v9.0.28.0
Royale Theme

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a breakdown of the seven options:

[For Microsoft fans]
The first two options include Internet Explorer 7 Web Browser, Outlook
Express Email Client, Windows Live Messenger 8 and Windows Media
Player 11 so Windows XP is completely up to date and as Bill Gates
intended.

[For people who don\'t like Microsoft programs]
The second two options do not include any of those items. In the second
two options where IE/OE/MSN/WMP are removed, Mozilla Firefox v2.0.0.1
is included to replace Internet Explorer. There are no replacements to the
other programs (OE/MSN/WMP) but you can just use your own programs
like Mozilla Thunderbird, Trillian, Winamp and so on.

[Automatic Driver Installation]
Options one and three both include drivers to cover the following:
Chipset, CPU, Ethernet LAN Cards, Graphics (ATI and NVIDIA),
SATA (Mass Storage), Sound Cards and Wireless Ethernet.

[No Drivers Included]
Options two and four do not contain those drivers - this is in case
you have SATA problems with the first or third options, or if you
just want to install your own drivers.

[Acronis Backup + Restore]
Option five allows you to backup your existing partition(s) before
installing Windows, or you can quickly restore a backup made
previously with Acronis.

[Hirens Boot CD v8.8]
Option six allows you to boot into Hirens Boot CD version 8.8. This is
a massive collection of more then 200 tools! Including Partition Tools,
Disk Clone Tools, Antivirus Tools, Recovery Tools, Testing Tools, RAM
(Memory) Testing Tools, Hard Disk Tools, System Information Tools, MBR
(Master Boot Record) Tools, BIOS / CMOS Tools, MultiMedia Tools, Password
Tools, NTFS Ext2FS, Ext3FS (FileSystems) Tools, Dos File Managers, Dos
Tools and Windows Tools. You can boot into Hiren\'s and have access to Norton
Partition Magic, Paragon Partition Manager, EasyRecovery... please see the
Hirens text file that is in the DOCS folder on the CD for the full list of tools
included in the Hirens Boot CD.

[Damn Small Linux v3.2]
This has to be one of the best things ever created in the world of computing!
Option seven is a 50Mb live Linux environment with the ability to connect to
the internet from within the Linux environment. Includes Mozilla Firefox web
browser and many other tools. What would you do if you totally lost your
Windows install and had to get online to troubleshoot the problem? This is
where Damn Small Linux comes in. NOTE: You might get an SCSI problem when
booting into this Damn Small Linux, if this happens, just reboot your PC
and press 7 to boot into Damn Small Linux, then type: dsl noscsi.

eXPerience folder (Desktop)

Desktop Icon Layout
Hardcore Ad-Blocker
Keyboard Settings
Save System RAM Memory

The last option here \"Save System RAM Memory\" can fine tune your system
by simply asking you a series of questions. If you say no to all the questions,
it is possible to have Windows TinyXP running on just four services, eleven
processes and using only 34.7Mb RAM - this would be an extremely reduced
functionality configuration but depending on your system you might be able
to run Windows on just four services! Most programs will still work but if you
say no to all questions it might affect internet connectivity - make sure to read
the questions... all you would have to do to get all your functionality back is
run the \"Save System RAM Memory\" and simply answer yes to each question.
