I tried all 4 options. [The release has the drivers but somehow can't find them when it comes time to copy files over to the harddrive]

=Please let me know if there is a quick fix...=

The description is misleading - using option 2 and 4 will not allow you to press F6 and put in your own driver. Using your own drivers is not allowed in unattended mode!

check this article if you want to look into fixing the release to include your raid drivers - http://www.pcstats.com/articleview.cfm?articleid=1703&page=5

I had to do a regular attended install to get the F6 to work since I was unsure how to integrate the raid driver in the release as the winnt.sif does not make use of OemPnpDriversPath "

,ChazzMatt,2007-08-13T23:53Z,"Finally found a computer to install this on. Older Windows 98 era computer that was upgraded to Windows 2000 a couple of years ago so the owner could run her DSL. Now been upgraded to TinyXP Rev06!


500Mhz Pentium III
40GB hard drive
187MB RAM (with 8MB integrated SiS 620 chip -- had to use Windows 2000 drivers on that, they didn't make XP drivers.)
Sony 40X CD burner
52x CD-ROM
old barrel style keyboard plug  with PS/2 adapter for modern keyboards
old serial port mouse plug -- but with PS/2 mouse port add-in card & 2 USB ports
PCI ethernet jack plug-in card

So, over the years the hardware had been upgraded some, but was now at the limit. The case, motherbaord and power supply are almost 10 years old! The major restriction was the 187MB RAM. Couldn't add anymore without spending more than the computer was worth! (plus I'm not sure they made larger RAM strips for that type RAM -- I think it was PC100).

With Windows 2000, it used 197MB RAM on bootup -- even though it only had 187MB physical RAM! Wow, the magic of virtual RAM.

With TinyXP rev 6 it now uses 124MB RAM -- less RAM than stock Windows 2000! Now has Windows XP PRO and all updates. I installed Office 2000 Pro instead of newer Office to keep the load as light as possible. 

When I was installing everything I saw it ran faster without ANY anti-virus, but this computer will be hooked to DSL so it's gotta have some protection and NOD32 is the best and the lightest. I gave it NOD32, but had to forgo any 3rd party firewall. (Even Comodo made it run very SLOW.) So, I just enabled the Windows XP firewall and hope that NOD32 will get rid of the nasties for them. I loaded on Ad-Aware Pro and Spybot, but took off the Ad-Aware as that app was using 18MB RAM even in the background. I set Spybot to scan every day, auto update, auto immunize, auto fix, auto close. (yes you can do that). 

Besides the WMP11 that came with TinyXP, I also installed Media Player Classic so they would have a choice.

I set virtual RAM for a range of 1024 - 2048 MB, so it can run other stuff over the physical RAM limit -- but at least it boots up to the desktop and functions with less RAM than it has onboard. 

Bottom line is this computer will never be a gaming machine.  But it will do simple word processing, e-mail & web surfing. Better if you do one task at a time, however... 

But TinyXP rev06 installed great and ran fine. If it ran on this machine, it will work wonders with newer ones."

There you will find a string named ""1"" with the digits ""00000409"", you will need to change the three last digits to your desired layout, a list can be found in ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layouts"".

NO, it doesn't -- if you have installed it right and burned it right.  When you unRAR the parts it's an ISO file.  

Do NOT try to extract anything from ISO.

Burn the untouched ISO slowly with Nero or ImgBurn -- 4x or slower.

Yeah the regular way of changing the desktop backround with the Display console doesn't work.  Very minor issue considering the great benefits of this modified OS.  

Here's a workaround:

Open any JPG you want with IE, Windows Picture & Fax Viewer, or Office 2003 Picture Manager.

Once the picture is open, RIGHT CLICK on the picture and choose ""Set as Desktop Background"".

If the same CD installs fine on your other computer, then sound like your CD drive is bad on your slower computer.  It doesn't seem to be reading the CD good.  Try a slower burn, as slow as possible, and see if the old CD drive can read that.  

If that doesn't work, open up the case and temporarily hook up the other CD drive to the old computer.  Then use that to install the OS."
