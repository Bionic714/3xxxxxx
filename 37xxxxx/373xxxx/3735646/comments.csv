,ahoy there ,2007-08-20T10:11Z,"Thanks so much for this Westward (I've checked a couple off of Phantoms and they work)

The Fixx were the first group I ever went to see in concert in Camden in the late eighties. Great music and, easy sound but deep lyrics if you really lsiten. I own most of these CD anyway, but it is great to have them all together in one place.

Thanks again!"
,Puunene,2007-10-31T18:33Z,Great download.  Would it be possible to put it back out at 192 or higher (currently 128)?  
,westward,2007-11-02T03:44Z,"Sorry, I don't have access to the original CD's at the moment. I ripped then down at 128 so they would fit one 1 CD for my car MP3 player."

,westward,2008-02-16T04:32Z,"The original torrent had some errors with the files and it did get uploaded to quite a few people before the problem was found, maybe there are copies of this torrent still around.
I know that some of the ID3 tags are incorrect for some of the songs, I used an automatic ripping programme that looked up CD data on the web and it screwed up some of the tags.
I am in the process of remaking the torrent as individual albums complete with lyrics and correct tags."
,goomba6666,2008-07-20T02:01Z,"Wow, I hope I never run into the waterhead that ripped this stuff. All tags are seriously screwed and the audio quality is crap. Why did you waste your time to only waste our time? DO NOT DOWNLOAD, COMPLETE JUNK!!!!!!!!"
,westward,2008-07-23T21:17Z,"Then go out and buy them all you fucking goomba!
Didn't you read the comments before you d/l it then?"
