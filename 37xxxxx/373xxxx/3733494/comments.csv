,4X-AXG,2007-07-06T13:39Z,"nooo don't fuck Bill Gates, that'll make him lose his virginity!"
,777-200LR,2007-07-08T20:58Z,The loader doesn't work :( The CS757 installer just asks for the verification code and the install doesn't continue. I did as was told in the readme. Any idea how to bypass the verification code ?
