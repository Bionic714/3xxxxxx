Sandokan is an animated adventure loosely based on Sandokan: The Pirate of Malaysia, by Emilio Salgari.
Sandokan is a deposed prince attempting to regain his throne from the British invaders. Along the way, he plunders, protects, and manages to fall in love with the daughter of his enemy.
This version of the classic tale replaces Sandokan and his crew with various animated animals, ala Animalympics. Sandokan is a tiger, of course.
A decently animated furry tale, this release contains all 9 episodes currently released on DVD.
PAL video, XVID/AC3, English spoken, no subtitles. This release replaces the previous single episode release from a month ago.
