,teomondo,2007-07-13T19:55Z,"I tred this crack on the italian trial version... it doesnt work!!!
Need help to make it work.
Im sure there are some files from US version to copy into my Photoshop CS3 folder to let the crack work.
I hope to find some help here... tried to look on the net for 2 days... nothing fond."
,kikoku,2007-07-17T06:51Z,"Per TEOMONDO (e tutti gli italiani!): stesso problema.
Poi ho letto meglio la nota che accompagna il torrent: il crack è applicabile solo alla versione 10.0x20070321, mentre il trial ITA che ho scaricato da Adobe.com è 10.0x20070420 (v. Info Photoshop CS3).
"
,Punks_4_Live,2007-07-19T20:47Z,"remember that this crack just works on build version 10.0x20070321 of the creative suite 3  design premium.

I tried it with an older version, but it didn't work. Now, with this version, it worked perfectly.

Thanks mowtown_philippe!"
,abatesunrise,2007-07-19T22:15Z,"I got this when I tried to open the crack:

The operation could not be completed. An unexpected error occurred (error code -10810)

Is there anything I can do or should I just try again? Or download the whole CS3 instead just for the codes?

I know for sure the version I have of Adobe CS3 Design Premium is 20070321. Also I've already separately gotten Photoshop and Acrobat to work, so I only need something for the others."
,shaft8869,2007-07-20T05:51Z,Can someone please seed this for me?
,pixappeal,2007-07-29T18:28Z,"Great job, mowtown! Would someone be kind enough to send me an invite to Demonoid? I would be forever grateful!!

Thanks  "
,Casemander,2007-08-01T02:21Z,"so this means if you download the software, the trial for example, that this will get rid of the trial period? what does ""just the cracks"" mean?"
,user1984,2007-08-01T18:07Z,I have PS CS3 build 10.0x20070403 - has anyone a hack for this?
,eide89,2007-08-04T13:22Z,"I have the exact same problem as ""abatesunrise"" here..

I´ve got the right version and everything, but i keep getting a error-message that says: ""An unexpected error occurred (error code -10810)""

Does enyone know how to solve this, or where to find another working patch for version 20070321?

,triphase,2007-08-30T11:30Z,"I clicked ""update"" by mistake and while some of the CS3 softwares couldn't update, Fireworks did. However, it became build 9.0.1.1213 and turned into a 30 day trial. The crack can't handle it.

So.. anyone with a working serial?"
