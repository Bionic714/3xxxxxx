         Ã?  The Claustrophobic EZX marks a new step for Toontrack  Ã?
         Ã?  in driving the development of percussive samples. The  Ã?
         Ã?  audio   team   at  Toontrack  has  utilized  drumhead  Ã?
         Ã?  selection, room and microphone configurations to fuse  Ã?
         Ã?  the  qualities  of  a high end drum recording and the  Ã?
         Ã?  cutting edge of the radical beats of today's top RnB,  Ã?
         Ã?  Hip Hop and Pop producers.                             Ã?
         Ã?  Add  to  that  samples  run through the best outboard  Ã?
         Ã?  effects  and  made accessible in the EZmixer to build  Ã?
         Ã?  your  own  mixer  presets for on the fly sound design  Ã?
         Ã?  and  youâ??ve got all the ingredients to produce, write  Ã?
         Ã?  and play music that takes you and your beats one step  Ã?
         Ã?  further,  C  for  Cutting edge, C for Contemporary, C  Ã?
         Ã?  for Claustrophobic.                                    Ã?
         Ã?                                                         Ã?
         Ã?  Oh,  and  did  we mention that the Claustrophobic EZX  Ã?
         Ã?  was recorded in a very small room?                     Ã?
         Ã?                                                         Ã?
         Ã?  The  Claustrophobic  EZX was sampled through the very  Ã?
         Ã?  best of outboard with distortion, reverb, compression  Ã?
         Ã?  and  attack  effects  included in the internal mixer.  Ã?
         Ã?  This  enables  you  to access a large number of mixer  Ã?
         Ã?  presets  by STS 9, Richard Devine, DJ Amplive, sub-ID  Ã?
         Ã?  and  Count  Bass  D. And you can save your own custom  Ã?
         Ã?  mixer presets (with EZdrummer 1.1).                    Ã?
