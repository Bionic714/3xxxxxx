,jicklet,2007-08-05T07:54Z,"There were multiple errors with this torrent. For instance, it took me about 20 tries on the first level to even make it to the bridge, due to the assault rifle firing rocket launcher ammo. The Pistol was shooting fully charged plasma pistol ammo. On the 3rd level I continually got an error that closed the game."
,DigitalCyberwave,2007-08-19T21:31Z,"Yea, I keep getting the same errors. The first level (2nd too maybe) the assault/machine gun fired rocket launcher ammo, the 3rd level WHICH I'M STILL STUCK ON DUE TO THE ""EXCEPTION!"" ERROR- the machine gun fires a charged blue plasma shot and then. The exception error is really annoying. I'm snipeing and then it closes.

Can you like, tell us whats wrong or reupload it or something?"
,bublet,2007-08-21T03:50Z,HAHAHA HE has mods for the game... deleting them MIGHT make the errors go away. I dont know how to delete the mods. But im sure there are ppl reading this who do.
