,eragonsucks,2007-07-03T14:40Z,Quality is poor. Hardsubed. Taken from the side of the theater. Imaged is not level. A significant portion of the screen was cropped. Sample doesn't represent real quality.
,meridius,2007-07-04T01:58Z,worst quality I've ever seen. Agree with the previous writer
,PirateOf_TheBay,2007-07-04T02:12Z,"Too bad u guys can't read then. It's a TS, and yes, it's not the best quality ever, so why don't release a better one urselves?? And quality is kinda good once u get past the first scenes because it's so dark.  And YES the sample is from the actual movie."
