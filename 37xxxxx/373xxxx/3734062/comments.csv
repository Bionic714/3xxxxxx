,FieroGT42,2007-12-09T22:53Z,"People, chill out.  Look at the size of the torrent... 4.23 GB.  The disc may just need to be rebuilt in order for it to play.  In fact, burnt games almost all play better after rebuidling.

I just got copied another game to keep my original safe, over 8GB ISO, then I rebuilt it and trimmed it down to 3GB by removing the non-file garbage that resides between the files for copy protection reasons.  This is exactly why most games SHOULD be rebuilt even if they run ""well enough"" otherwise!

I'm going to d/l this, rebuild, and post back my results if I remember."
,FieroGT42,2007-12-17T23:47Z,"Confirmed working!  Extract ISO file layout with IsoBuster (Even the demo version will do this), rebuild with Sony CD/DVD-ROM Generator 2.0 adding files in order of LBA ascending.

You people are having problems because you don't rebuild your PS2 games!  It will drop the size of this game from by 2GB of garbage data that resides between files.

Then you will not have any problems if you burn to GOOD QUALITY DVD media at native read speed of your PS2 to account for any disc eccentricity.  This means nothing from a retail store!! Search AfterDawn for trusted sources of Taiyo Yuden DVD-R media.  You can get them for < $0.34 each, after shipping."
,FieroGT42,2007-12-17T23:52Z,"Oh, and by the way, terrier.... please properly rebuild any other games you up in the future to prevent this again.  It will save everyone else the trouble, and it would have cut the download size to < 50%"
,Molngrabb,2008-01-21T12:39Z,Isn't this a game for PS3???
,WillyWonkaDoopidyDo,2008-02-18T15:20Z,Works perfectly with swap magic
,xstony69,2008-04-14T06:37Z,"I had the same problem with game getting stuck during the loading part. Rebuild the ISO file.  It comes down to 2.19 GB after rebuilding. Now works fine.

Thanks to FieroGT42 for the comments.
