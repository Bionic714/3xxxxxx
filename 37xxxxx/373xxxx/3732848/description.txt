Yodelling Mad! - The Best Of Country Yodel, Volume 1	
Catalogue: JASMCD 3552
Release Date: Feb 02

The artists selected for this brief trawl through the recorded history of 
Country yodelling go back to the days before the word ?Country? had been 
accepted as a description of the music. If it had a name, it was described 
as rural, folk or old-time music - the sophisticates of New York and other 
large conurbations dismissed it as ?hill-billy?. Whatever the appellation, 
its appeal was widespread, and not just across the vast heartland of America - 
it was the music of the people, from the people, something that the mass of 
ordinary people could directly relate to in its sincerity, social comment or humour.
