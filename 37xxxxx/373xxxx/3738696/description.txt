Aerosoft Monastir 2005 (RIP)

Well known to millions of European sunseekers, the airport of Monastir has been missing from FS2004 until now. But now you 

got one more destination for your medium range flights starting in Western Europe. You will find Monastir H. Bourguiba 

Airport high in detail and pretty lively. There are no gates, so you will have to use the platform parkings, a nice change 

from the larger airports!
