Harvey Danger is a rock band that formed in Seattle, Washington in 1992, and rose to prominence in 1998 with the single "Flagpole Sitta". The band released a new album in 2005, Little by Little..., after the five-year hiatus that followed the release of their second album, King James Version.

Where Have All The Merrymakers Gone?, released by Arena Rock Recording Co. in 1997 and Slash in 1998, was Harvey Danger's first full album. The second song on the album, "Flagpole Sitta", received lots of airplay nationwide and resulted in the first real fame that the band ever knew.
