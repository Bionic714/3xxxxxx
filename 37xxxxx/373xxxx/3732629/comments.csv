,Mikeybikey_lol,2007-07-07T00:23Z,Hi! Just got the new BMW 5 Series Touring (E61) with Navi Pro. How is this different from 2007-1 German version also on this site besides the speed cam in UK? Does this feature work for Sweden too? Are the maps updated? This is Pan-Europe right?
,kopite4eva,2007-07-08T14:24Z,"Maps are updated. 2007 ver 2 instead of Ver 1. Should work for Sweden.  has maps for all over europe not just germany

,shin0r,2007-07-10T10:49Z,"Thanks uploader - will seed this for a long time!

To answer the questions which will inevitably be asked:

a: This is the Professional version - if you don't have Professional Nav, it won't work. Read your car's manual to see if you have Professional or Business Nav.

b: This will work on all ""new model"" BMWs; e60/61, e90, new x3, new x5, new 6 series and new 7 series. It will not work on the old e39 5 series, e46 3 series or old X5.

c: burn the ISO file to DVD with Nero or tool of choice. You can use DVD-R or DVD+R, a safe speed to burn at is 4X.

d: The ""language"" of the DVD is irrelevant, as the DVD contains maps and locales for all of Europe.

e: To install the DVD, simply place it in the DVD slot of your car, and follow the instructions on-screen - it takes about 10 minutes.

,320dat,2007-07-28T17:50Z,"I used Nero and opened the imagefile and burned it directly. Actually much easier than the 2007-1.

Good luck"

,kzkzkzkz,2007-09-02T20:02Z,The same like Deadmarsh's. How to shut down the system?
,wombleskin,2007-09-09T01:17Z,"can anyone clarify what it means by shutting down the system? 

i am stuck on this also

thanks"
,schtaaf,2007-09-10T15:23Z,In this case I found that 'shutting' down the system is simply to turn off the ignition for the requested 5 minutes.  Works perfectly in my E61 2006.
,Brother DT,2007-09-12T00:30Z,"This does NOT work in 2004 E65
