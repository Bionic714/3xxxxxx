BMW 2007-2 Sat Nav DVD

Updated with June UK Speed Camera database.

This is for the new Series BMW, I am using it in My E90  Navigation Professional 2006 reg

To get the speed cameras

Select any destination and then select info about destination

Scroll to CAR / Travel  and then you will find Speed Cameras

Select any.

Then when using perspective view they will appear as points of interests.

Includes the mobile cameras too.

Enjoy.
