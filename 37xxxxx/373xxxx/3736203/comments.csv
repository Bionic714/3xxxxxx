,Chasym,2007-07-10T07:23Z,"lol, yet your site isnt even up. and at this rate, while i wait. will keep going down. you can say all we have is ebooks all you want. so you could only get ahold of some ebook torrents and hardly anything else, shows how good your lolhacking skills are. im not sweatin it, its not my site gettin pwnd."
,Chasym,2007-07-10T07:29Z,"also lets do some math, you have about 1000 torrents. 800 or so i have here.
250 ebooks.
aom has 2000 torrents and growing everyday, 450 are ebooks in your case. ill just say we have 500 ebooks to even it out and please you a little bit.
that leave us 1500 non ebooks.

and leaves you with 750 non ebooks?

yet you have more? so lets do some more math

Add psycho stalker with an obsessive hidden in the closest obsession with another man, and a guy not so good at math with his statements and we got...Cheeky. congratulations. 
"
,cheekychap,2007-07-10T16:01Z,ALSO ANTHER THING HALF THESE TORRENTS HAVE PASSWORDS
,Chasym,2007-07-10T19:35Z,"dont cry because you dont have the password now, your a real good hacker remember. you can get them!....lmao. sorry i couldnt help but laugh there."
,cheekychap,2007-07-11T03:43Z,"WHY DO I NEED THE PASSES WEN I OWN THE TORRENNTS FOOL, IM WARNING OTHERS WHO DOWNLOAD, AS THERE GONNA BE DISAPOINTED THREW U :)
BUT THATS WOT YOUR SITES ALL ABOUT, THE WHOLE CONTENT OF YOUR SITE IS 1 BIG LET DOWN :)"
,Chasym,2007-07-11T07:37Z,"lol, boast all you want. you have a big ego only backed by your own lies and obsessions. why are your members wanting in aom so bad now? must be because your so much better. gotta be!
and dont listen to cheeky, his files work fine. just trying to persuade you to not download them because he cant do anything else about it.

and come on man, hurry up! get the site back up, and yeah fix that security thing! i need a little more challenge than last time! gotta bring the ""Endgame""! 
i think its about time you accepted theres no way you can win. shoulda accepted peace.
but oh well, stubborn is the downfall of many :)"
,stadig,2007-07-11T10:55Z,how can i become a member of AOM?
,Chasym,2007-07-18T02:47Z,"so cheeky. are we willing to call a truce here and end this lame war and l iive peacefully as two good seperate magic communities that exist for the sole purpose of what we were meant to do, magic?
or will this war continue. as much as i love hacking, i love magic more and would rather not be fighting with fellow magicians and just stick to our own.
its up to you. if so, ill take this down. wanna talk it out? let me know, ill come to your chat.
this is my final kind offer in this, im extending the offer with AOM backing it.
up to you."
,stadig,2007-07-21T23:59Z,"thats the spirit......cmon make it

what we the people want is torrents,  NOT 
hacking non working magic sites

we just want the good stuff u know"
,stadig,2007-07-22T00:00Z,chasym how do i become a member of AOM
,bunglex,2007-08-01T11:48Z,To become a member of aom you have to be invited by someone. Its not easy because all invites go through admin and they judge whether to accept you or not. So if you want to join go to magic forums etc and try to become friend with a member
,Chasym,2007-08-07T04:27Z,"""WE ARE NOT BEING ATTACKED!""
lmao! good one, you had your members believing you!
thats nothing new with how much you lie and mislead them.
its cool your changing locations...but wait, why are you hosting the site on the SAME server location as the current site, the only difference is you have a .com address to mask your IP. im afraid that just wont help you. I offered peace, a truce. with only 2 small requests, a name change and peace between the sites.
you ignored me, im sure your members would have welcomed such a deal with open arms.
now i have only just begun."
,Chasym,2007-08-07T05:06Z,cant even talk it out cheeky? well i guess your site has to stay down then.
,danfog,2008-02-27T22:27Z,Can someone please seed the torrents inside the file you get with this. This torrent downloaded really quickly but there are no seeders for the torrents inside it :(
,henkka1,2008-04-11T15:30Z,"reseed
"
,ArkaosMGC,2009-07-18T04:22Z,hello Chasym!! i would like to ask you something about AOM...!! do u have a blog or something to talk to you?? 
,LokiTheCoyote,2009-11-18T07:00Z,ummm.. wtf is this?.. there's no files
