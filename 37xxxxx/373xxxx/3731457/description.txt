Stealing America - Vote By Vote
-------------------------------


A new Feature-length Documentary by EMMY-winning, OSCAR-nominated filmmaker Dorothy Fadiman

STEALING AMERICA: Vote by Vote documents significant irregularities in the Presidential election of 2004 while underscoring the fact that election fraud and reform are not partisan issues. The film weaves together dramatic behind-the-scenes experiences of poll workers, computer security experts, journalists, politicians, activists and voters of all ages. We hear from those who feel their communities were targeted for intimidation during the election, side by side with  descriptions of irregular machine tallies, in which the number of votes tallied don't equal the number of votes cast.

The Presidential election of 2004 ignited both personal, as well as political passions for millions of people. For many, their involvement did not end when the election was over.

We need to be careful and aware and not take anything at face value. We have to pay attention or we could be tricked. My film does not solve anything, but encourages responsibility. We need to help close that gaping wound for those who are disenfranchised socially and return the idea that voting is easy, comfortable and safe. Dorothy Fadiman
