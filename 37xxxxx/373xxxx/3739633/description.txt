Hi everyone, here's another Edguy torrent for you to enjoy. In this torrent, there are 4 studio albums and 1 EP, all listed below:

Studio Albums:
Vain Glory Opera
Theater of Salvation
Mandrake
Rocket Ride

EP: Superheroes

These are all ripped directly from the CD at the highest quality possible for mp3 - 320kbps at a 44KHz sampling rate. As such, the files are quite large, so probably not the best if you have an mp3 player with less space.

For those who are looking for the entire Edguy Discography, you can check out my other torrent at this location:

The discography has much more of their music, but it is not of the same quality (192kbps VBR).

I will seed whenever I can, so downloads may be slow to begin with but will hopefully pick up once other people have completed the download and started seeding. Please seed once you have finished so you at least have a ratio of 1.000, preferably more. Help share this awesome music!

Enjoy
