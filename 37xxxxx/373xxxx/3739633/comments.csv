,brutalspoon,2008-03-05T01:06Z,"Sorry everyone, it seems that I can't get it working - As I said before, I've made a new torrent which contains all of the listed albums (as well as some of the lower quality albums which I can't remove for some strange reason) which can be found here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4063096

Again, sorry for all the hassle!"
