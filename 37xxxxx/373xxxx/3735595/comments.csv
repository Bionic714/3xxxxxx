but nah you had to go all ego trip on the claim of being the one to do it you screwed up the file
if you had done a direct rip one wouldnt even need damian tools or a no cd patch you fuckin dolt

when i do rips of game disc they come out after you burn the image to a disc of being a PERFECT working copy of the game no patches or bullshit needed....d00d how hard can it be to make a clone of a $10.00 walmart discount bin game you fuckin n00b
