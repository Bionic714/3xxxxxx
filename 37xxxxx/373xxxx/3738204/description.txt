SSH is the industry standard for remote access to Linux, Mac OS X, and UNIX computers because it's safe, secure, and just works from anywhere on the Internet. SSH servers like OpenSSH and VShell also have a powerful system called SFTP already installed. Unrelated to the archaic FTP protocol, SFTP is a modern, secure system that gives you the power to treat your network files as if they were right on your desktop. Stream movies and music. Run programs. Load and save any file from any application. Best of all, your SSH server is ready to go.

If you can SSH to your server, you can map it as an SFTP drive. Every network equation has two sides, the server and the client. Your SSH server is already setup and so is your client. Just launch SftpDrive and mount your SSH server. All you need to know is your login and password.
