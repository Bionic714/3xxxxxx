One of Walerian Borowczyk's best late-period films. A twisted take on Stevenson's original story. Filled with erotic imagery, violence and nightmarish, dream-like scenes, this one will burn itself into your subconscience. Wonderful trippy soundtrack by Bernard Parmegiani.

This is a rip from the original uncut Dutch video. It's the only way to see this film for now. The quality is quite decent considering the situation.

Enjoy. More Borowczyk on the way!
