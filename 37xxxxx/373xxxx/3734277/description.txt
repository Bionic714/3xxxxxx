Freshly ripped from Audio CD at 64kbps.
I have downloaded some that were from audio cassettes and they were noisy and had skips in them. Points go out to the dudes who took the time to do it with the cassettes. I have not been able to find any audio cds for the earliest novels of  the series. The earliest novel on audio CD I have been able to find is The Fires of Heaven. I will upload that in the next week or two.
