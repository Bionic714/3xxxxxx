,albguy,2007-08-19T06:47Z,No seeder... stuck at 67% for over a week now. 
,rossp,2007-10-28T22:44Z,Yeah I gave up on this one too. Why can't people seed?
,binstar,2007-11-11T01:29Z,"Let's hope the seeding issues have been worked out since I just started this.

I think part of the problem is when collections are compressed into an archive. Then, not only can people not just get teh files that they need, but also, once downloaded, in order to keep seeding you essentially need to take double the space to keep seeding.

Thanks to the original poster."
,binstar,2007-11-12T21:06Z,Well now I'm stuck at 68.7. Fantastic.
,blg23torrent,2007-12-22T16:21Z,"Hi, Please can someone seed this. I am also stuck at 68.7%.

Once this has been downloaded I will then also become a seeder.

Thanks"
