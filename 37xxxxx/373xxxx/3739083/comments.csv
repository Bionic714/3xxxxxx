Installing Mac OSX Tiger without a Dual Layer DVD

PREP
Have TWO blank partitions ready. One will be for the installer and the other will be where you install OSX Tiger.

LET?S GO

* With your disc image mounted, open the Disk Utility application (Applications -> Utilities).
* Click the Restore tab (see it near the top of the Disk Utility window? Just after First Aid, Erase and RAID?)
* Drag your DMG file from the list on the left of your Disk Utility window to the ?Source? field.
* Then, drag the icon of the partition you want to put the installer on to the ?Destination? field. Again, do this from the left pane of your Disk Utility window. If you try to do this from the desktop (as I kept trying to do) you?re going to drive yourself bonkers.
* Click the ?Erase Destination? check box so that it shows a check.
* I also skipped the Checksum. You might or might not want to do the same. Your call.
* Click Restore.
* Wait until done.

Once the above is complete you now have a bootable OSX Tiger Install partition."

,diablogate,2008-12-14T23:38Z,"Worked like a charm on a (2006) MacBook Intel Core Duo.

Tips: There are 7 installation steps. On the fourth step ""Installation Type"" click ""Customize"" and uncheck everything you can.  The ""Essentials"" is all you need and you can't uncheck it anyway.  Install is complete in under 20 minutes and then you can update from ""Software Updates"" in the apple menu.

A++ upload, SkinnyNGO."
,diablogate,2008-12-14T23:46Z,"Oh and another thing, don't let it ""verify your installation DVD"" it may want you to ""insert disk 2"" which means you're pooched and have to start over."
