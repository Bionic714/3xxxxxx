,Refia,2007-09-11T02:24Z,Comment II is just as useless as comment I. This is obviously not an ISO because there's no .iso extension on the downloaded file. It works if you spend any marginal amount of time to actually unpack it. Retard.

,lemmeseed,2011-11-10T08:40Z,"Hey, sorry to bother, but could someone please seed?

I'm at 0.2% ;_;"
,lemmeseed,2011-11-11T21:52Z,"Seems like there's no seeds so I may never complete this... :(

Can someone upload the script file?

Been searching for so long for the Chinese version of PM4 and I can't even download it."
