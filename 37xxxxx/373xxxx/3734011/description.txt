Princess maker is a series where you are a father raising up a ten year-old daughter to the age of eighteen. You determine her schedule, where she works, what clothes she wears, what she eats, what education she will get, and her overall status as a townsperson. This is the fourth game in the series in Chinese.

NOTE: This is part two, only uploaded for those people whose winRAR asks them for it, but you can download it anyway if you want or whatever. I don't know. :/

Enjoy! :)
