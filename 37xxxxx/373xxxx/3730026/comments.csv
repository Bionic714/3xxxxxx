when I play the iso i made of it, i can only chose language in first menu and then vlc shuts off. and vlc usualy handles dvd's best among my players, totem, mplayer, vlc.

disc2 with extras do work, but the problem there is that the only language options are france and spanish. in disc1 they are only english and spanish."
