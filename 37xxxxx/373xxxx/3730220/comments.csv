,cpuwhiz1028,2007-07-03T22:21Z,"Ok, so I uninstalled the game I had, and reinstalled it using the .ccd image that I uploaded.  The installation went well and I was able to play without any problems.  I used Daemon Tools to mount the image.  What did you use?"

,iTarik,2010-10-14T00:32Z,"The game is running great, but it's missing Duke's voice and sound of my weapons when I'm shooting... :)"
,TriberFranckRJ,2010-10-28T01:57Z,is this working??
,Joeisapirate,2011-01-24T06:38Z,"Great up, odd sound issues though. It's just crunchy overall, but still playable. And the HD Textures look great! Thanks."
,stalker59,2011-03-15T07:24Z,"Everything works for me, I don't need crack, sound is OK, but if you have sound issues, try this: In Quick Setup window click on Advanced, and untick everything, mainly Disable Hardware 3D Sound"
,zxkb4s29,2011-06-06T22:09Z,"this game is only 181 MB (169 MiB) without cd error-correction data (circ), the maxpayne demo, maxpayne video and the directx installers, and compressed with 7z.
that's 78% SMALLER"
