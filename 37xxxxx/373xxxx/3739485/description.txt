Old BBC TV film now impossible to find and never shown on TV for reasons of political correctness (Holly Aird is caned thrice).

Although I ripped this from a dvd , the dvd itself is obviously a copy of a VHS and the quality is not what I normally submit. The colors are as you would expect, the background music \'stretches\' and the edges of the frame a little ragged. However as it is so rare and as it is still very watchable(despite the Hebrew subs that can\'t be removed) I am uploading it.. just don\'t expect aXXO quality.Plays fine on VLC
