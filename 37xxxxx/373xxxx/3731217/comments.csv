Minimum Requirement :
-600 Mhz Processor ;
-256 MB RAM ( it will run excellent on 512 ) ;
-5 GB free HDD space ;
-32 MB video card (for some visual effects, you will need a 64 MB one ) ;

Installation :
-Burn the ISO, after extraction(needs WinRAR or 7-Zip), on a DVD. Then, it's up to you which installation method you like to use.
-Installation is Fully Automated. You don't have to enter any stuff, like cd-key or regional settings ;
-No activation is required. This is build on Corporate Edition of Windows XP SP2 ;
-The installation supports both New installation and Upgrade methods. Use which you want !

Features :
-What you will see from the first login is the unique interface Vista-like.
-All common drivers included ( CPU, Chipset, Graphics, LAN, Sound, WLAN, MassStorage, Modem, Monitor, TV-Tuner, Scanner, Broadband, USB, Webcam, Additions, Input, Misc, Virtual). You will need to install only Printer drivers, if you have one ;
-All Post-SP2 Updates included until the release date ;
-New right-click options (for end-users especially) ;

-Control Panel extensions for common daily activities ;
-A collection of applications, which covers needs for all types of users ;

-Some extra, rarely and cool used fonts.

Known Issues :
-RyanVM's .Net Framework AIO will take some time to install (don't be affraid, the setup doesn't freeze) ;
-Movie Maker crashes due to some system file patches. If you need it, just reinstall it, else, you can let it just so ;
-To have all Visual Effects running, run Vista Inspirat 2 Config from desktop, set all stuff On and click Update BricoPack button ;
-You have to register some applications by yourself ( see Registration(Installation) Keys.txt file ).Also, you must apply some keys/cracks by yourself.

Attention ! -This Windows has been tested on a Virtual Machine, not on a real PC. Some things can run differently !
-I will be not responsible for any damage it can make to your computer ! Use it on your own risk !

If you have any other questions, post them here, i am open to answer them."
