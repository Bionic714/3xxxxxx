,Aerowixx,2009-02-15T00:50Z,"If it wont work on your Vista, it may work when ran with the program DosBox. Some older games, like ""Capture the Flag"" is tested on a x64 operating system and working good in DosBox."

,ugex,2012-04-19T10:30Z,"there is a suspicious file, detected as trojan in autorun.exe and regtro.exe (or similar name).

that you dont need those files exactly to play the game. so just delete them with antivirus and run SETUP.exe from extracted folder."
