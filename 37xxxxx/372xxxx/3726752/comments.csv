,techmannie,2007-06-30T00:00Z,"All versions Shadowrun XP will cause ctd's in some systems in relation  to o/s settings, something we XP users simply can't skate around...Unfortunatley this was programmed for Vista even more so then Halo 2...

,420dopeman,2007-06-30T00:27Z,"This is true,,, nothing can be done until a better standard DX10 can be duplicated in XP, its development actually seems to be getting pretty close to a final, if not already, I will surely help bring it to all XP users attention when I use and test it."

,Dcav,2007-07-04T23:27Z,The game does work just fine it just seriousily blows.  You need to get to the main menu and ignore the signing in portion by hitting the x in the corner.

,beedatopytia,2007-07-16T10:07Z,"This game is really, really fun. For all the XP users: Vista will run this game much more smoothly - providing that your computer could run it in the first place.

If you don't have Vista, and don't have a problem with installing another Operating System and dual booting (or just installing over XP altogether), download a 32-bit version of Vista here:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3729175/Windows.Vista.Ultimate.Preactivated-Pirattracker

I'm running that version right now, and no problems thus far."
,beedatopytia,2007-07-16T10:15Z,"One more thing - I did actually have one problem. I was missing two files: d3dx9_31.dll and xinput1_3.dll. 

I thought that first file had something to do with Directx 9 or something so I updated on my computer... nothing happened. 

Since I had installed on XP I figured I already had those files. I did, and I put them in the Windows folder in Vista and it worked."
,sidorenkoPL,2007-08-01T06:14Z,"Everything's cool but if I can make a suggestion... It would have been very nice if ,in the game info on this site or in the game file , you could put the amount of space needed after unzipping/raring  because somtimes you don't expect that the game will take lots of it.

Anyway like always good releasse :)"
,sidorenkoPL,2007-08-01T06:18Z,"This is a message to Whelsh and all ppl with D3dx9_31.dll file problem... The reason is quite simple, as you can imagine dx9 means directx 9 so I'd recommend to download the LATEST ( always search for the latest one) DirectX 9.0c install and play... :)"

,Volvagia_00,2008-07-02T04:22Z,Preciate the torrent Dopeman I'll come back to you anytime. Also if you are looking for a Product key. Try using one for other games for windows products. My halo 2 vista key worked for shadowrun. Go figure.
,niklashbg,2008-08-18T18:14Z,"Thx Dopeman! Love your releases :D

BUT!
I can't get this game to run because it ""Encounters a problem and needs to close"" 2 seconds after I start it. I can't seem to figure out exactly where the problem is, since I've tried to reinstall both Visual C++ 2005 and LIVE Runtime, like twice... It doesn't give me any clue wether it's a missing file or program that's causing the problem...

Thanks"

I'm loving this torrent, when it works. Shadowrun is by far my favorite game. I am having problems with it after a few launches.

""Unable to initialize Live for Windows components"".

I've searched high and low, to find a fix, and i'm stuck. Is this a torrent based problem? Also, is there a way to fix this?"
