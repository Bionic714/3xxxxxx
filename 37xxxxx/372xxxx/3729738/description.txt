About Failed Utopia
.. Failed Utopia is a body of work comprising distorted beats, ambient textures.. It's always changing, evolving, devolving into something or nothing eventually.
Originally the project had several rotating members, this isn't really happening anymore.

Currently, I am working on a new release that is a bit different from anti, but still keeps the pummeling flow going. Less straight ahead 4 to the floor, more break oriented with a bit more texture work.
The "new clip" up there is pretty much me working with that sound, it's a little rough, but it's to give you an idea of the direction.
