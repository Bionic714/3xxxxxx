I am sick and tired of sites like blackcats and demonoid being the only ones with NTSC games that people want. They almost never open registration and people are left begging for invites. So here it is free for everyone not just members of those sites. This is for PS2. If you are looking for any other games for PS2, PS3 or Xbox360 that you have been unable to get, post it here and I should be able to upload it within 24 hours. I will also be posting online working versions of games soon as well. The DNAS files will already be corrected. I will be seeding this for atleast two weeks 24/7. Enjoy
