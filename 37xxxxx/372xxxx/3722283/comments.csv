,recon6913,2007-06-24T02:05Z,what format do I have to burn it in for the PS2? CD or DVD? thanx for the download.
,trackhead25,2007-06-24T02:09Z,You have to burn it to DVD
,trackhead25,2007-06-24T03:08Z,"My apologies to all those who first started downloading, I didnt realize my global upload speed was capped. I set it to unlimited so the speed should be way faster than it was originally. Happy downloading and don't forget to seed when your download is finished, thats all the thanks I need. For anyone interested I'll be uploading Mortal Kombat Armageddon NTSC later tonight. It will be online capable."
