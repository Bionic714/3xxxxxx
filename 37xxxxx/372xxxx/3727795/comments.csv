Could you actually seed this. There are about 53 people all at 67,8% with no seeders."

,cardio181,2007-07-01T20:10Z,"There is a readme that explains about the interface in

SchoolMate_English-Interface-V0.8f.7z

It's a simple patch. In that 7z file there are two replacements:

sm00_00.pp
smp00_00.pp

Copy them into your data folder"
,mjormana,2007-07-01T21:12Z,How do i get it to work in vista?
,Rikker51,2007-07-01T21:22Z,Regtool won't work error message This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect
,Pjukka,2007-07-01T21:56Z,How are you suppose to get english interface? I start the game from English exe but it just gives me  japanese settings?
,Pjukka,2007-07-01T22:17Z,"Got the exe working. Unless you speak japanese this game is pretty useless, only the menus are translated to english."
,Inzejn,2007-07-01T22:22Z,The regtool doesn't work for me and neither does the English exe....why not????
,Inzejn,2007-07-01T22:37Z,"Has anyone gotten this thing to work? WITH the english interface too????

If yes, say how, cause it isn't as easy as cardio181 is saying. A more specific instruction is needed!!"
,cardio181,2007-07-01T23:15Z,"Inzejn: What is your problem? You're not being specific at all. The installation is simple. If you want to use the English interface patch, read the instructions in it! All you have to do is copy the two .pp files into the ""data"" folder.

Rikker51: You are probably missing msvcr80.dll msvcm80.dll on your Windows install

Pjukka: People don't play this to read the text. When someone does a full story translation, you can install it.

mjormana: ? How does it not work in Vista?"
,Inzejn,2007-07-01T23:35Z,"cardio181: The regtool doesn't work, and there aren't any .pp files to copy, only the ""English interface beta 0.8f"" which i have tried to copy over, but i guess since the regtool doesn't work i can't really find out if the english interface works.

Neither of the exe.files work either, but that is also connected to the regtool i guess...i think i might have the same problem as Rikker51"
,zomgkittylazerz,2007-07-02T00:32Z,"Installed it twice now, keeps saying that there's no archive found when trying to open the winrar file."
,Pjukka,2007-07-02T10:22Z,"SchoolMate_English-Interface-V0.8f.7z is a packed file like rar or zip. Unpack it (with winrar for example) and you find necessary files and instructions there. cardio181, got your point. And found out that you can get to ""action"" by just clicking few minutes."
,cardio181,2007-07-02T11:15Z,"Inzejn: Yeah, what do you mean it doesn't work?

,DjNilo,2007-07-04T00:22Z,"Ett gott råd till alla som laddar ner denna.
Det funkar inte med allt som Cardio förklarade, Pullshit, Efter man han spelat i ungefär 4-7 miinuter så kommer det skicka felrapport & spelet stängs ned.
Andra felet med denna spel är språket.
Man får bara engelska i startmeny inte i resten av spelet. Det är japanska hela meny.
Värdelös inget att ha om man inte kan japanska eller chineska eller vadfan nu det är för språk.

 cardio181: You can suck your dick .
This game dont works."
,cardio181,2007-07-04T01:43Z,"DjNilo: hvorfor fanden tror du der er den der fucking engelsk interface patch? Prøv at læse lidt din forpulet nar. og spillet fungr fint.. flere hundre har downloaded. Hold så din kæft!

A word of advice to you: shut up if you can't understand simple instructions. You complain about the language? Try writing in English, asshole. People can understand you either way."
,Deznaj,2007-07-05T00:14Z,"Hey cardio181, don't blame others for your crappy work OK?

They say the game doesn't work, it doesn't work. That's reason enough for me to pass on it."
,cardio181,2007-07-06T01:37Z,"Deznaj: Hey, I don't care if you pass on it. If you want to listen to unfounded complaints, that's your choice. I've played the game and know it works. And I'll respect people if they respond without immature, stupid insults, too.

It's been downloaded tons of times on the other servers. Unfortunately, people here seem to only post their bad comments. Someone like Pjukka responded too quickly before he got into the game (being in Japanese), but he was cool and posted to say that he figured it out. But people mostly just post to complain.

Remember, this game company DOES NOT publish games in English. Everything that is a patch is done by users and a lot of it is in beta stages. It's really annoying to download something with a crap patch already installed. So this version gives you the original game (Yes, in Japanese) without the hassles that were involved with the original installer and that process to convert it to the English installer.

I put this together because of that. If you don't want it, that's fine. However, it's not fine to make ignorant posts and insult people for no reason.

I put this here to share and I'm happy to try and help, but people should read instructions and know what they are downloading before they complain."

,forsaken1111,2007-07-24T05:50Z,"The problem was that the ""smp00_00.pp"" file was named incorrectly. You have to change it to ""smm00_00.pp"" and then replace the file of the same name in the data folder."
,forsaken1111,2007-07-24T05:54Z,Okay I have installed it and replaced all files included. The menus are all in english but the game text is not. What have I missed?
,cardio181,2007-07-25T01:18Z,forsaken1111: you just missed paying attention. This game has no official English version. There is the English interface fan translation and there will likely be a fan translation of the game text at some point.

,cardio181,2007-07-29T16:17Z,"Morad: The english interface patch should cover that? Check to make sure you replaced the right files.

,Drmann,2007-09-13T07:16Z,"Hello,
I almost always screw these things up, and I am hoping someone will help with some Dummies type questions lol.  Ok, I got the game torrent, opened it with WinRar.  Winrar now has a window with these files:

data                       
SchoolMate.exe
regtool.exe
license.txt

next to this it says ""unpack to any directory and run regtool"".

my dummies questions so far heheh are, Which do I double click next, and what directory do I unpack everything too.  Sorry if these seem a bit novice, but so far sexy beach 3 is the only illusion game I have been able to get to work right from torrents.  Not the sharpest tool in the shed here lol.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks and have fun"

,nutmilk,2007-12-13T06:13Z,"i agree though with slaven, all the issues i encountered were resolved by his comments sections (thanks, guys!) 

HOWEVER, I have to ask, is it worth it? After downloading, it took me two hours to install it and get it working properly. 

But once I got it working properly, I sat through about 30 minutes of Japanese text before I found a part of the game that was playable. 

And then once I started playing, I played for a half hour and quit. Game has glaring 3D errors, and is generally repetitive and boring. Plus all that Japanese screeching gets on your nerves.

So if your having a lot of trouble getting this to work, don't sweat it too much.
