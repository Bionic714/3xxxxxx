,Huntarr,2007-06-24T22:40Z,"thanks

Anyone have the newer personal edition?"
,daraptor0,2007-06-26T01:43Z,lol you mean the $150 pro version they use in the millitary?
,Huntarr,2007-06-26T02:22Z,"lol, hell yeah it looks good. just phishing ;)    

Thanks again for the gold ed."
,screecwe,2007-07-02T22:14Z,Hell yah I've been lookin for months for the PE edition. If anyone can find it we'd appreciate if you could post it. I used to drive tanks myself (M1A1's) and this sim is actually good training. The most realistic ive found.
,daraptor0,2007-07-24T16:12Z,"You can't pirate PE, when you buy the $120 simulator, it comes with a piece of hardware that is required for the game to run. So, it's not possible to pirate it, it says right on the site the hardware piece is for antipiracy. You'll just have to buy it if you want it. Tank driver eh? that sounds cool. The game was developed by ex tank crews."
,vazel,2007-09-10T09:50Z,Just wait until Steel Beasts II comes out that one is going to be based on PE. Until then regular Steel Beasts is fine  thanks for uploading this I couldn't find it anywhere else.

Sure you could pirate it, it uses a usb dongle just as Cubase. And that one has been cracked...

Oh but its a big hassle and i doubt anyone will ever go thru cracking it for a game :)"
,daycab,2008-03-11T08:05Z,Does anyone have Steel Beasts Pro!
,legionlleh,2008-03-11T20:26Z,i extract it but for some reason it doesnt work just the vid 
,Bugfur,2008-06-04T23:20Z,"I have a Steel Beasts Pro PE ISO, but there's no point in uploading because of Codemeter.

If it gets cracked, I'll upload it. Until then, it's not worth the heat."
,Bugfur,2008-06-12T11:44Z,"If someone could upload the old tank sim ""Spearhead"" it would be appreciated!

Even better would be the professional military version. Good luck finding that though...

:)"
,rasmusx15,2008-07-18T20:10Z," i have a problem... when the game starts, everything is fine... until i start a mission or a tutorial, the tank is there but the map is black, the sight is black, and when i look around in the periscope, everything is black... is it just me who are having this problem???"
,thepikaxe,2008-08-02T20:31Z,its great game and one of a hell fantastic simulator in the army i was a loader in a israeli merkava 2

,Badashell,2008-10-16T21:27Z,Should be intresting to try this game.. Loaded the IKV91 during my service 
,sweetpea912,2009-06-26T18:10Z,"Yeah i am having same problem with the black screen, game loads fine  and fast but something wrong. Please help because i love this game. I have original disc but it has errors on it when i load."
,ZERO_BS,2009-07-16T13:31Z,"Anyone have a copy of Spearhead? Imagic made it.

It's the only tank sim I don't have... and one of only 4 worth having."
,moron13,2009-11-12T06:22Z,"interesting to play this game, i used to be a gunner in the M1A2 "
,Rayvyn007,2011-01-18T23:52Z,Steel Beasts Pro PE can be caracked and probably would be except for one thing. Hardly anyone wants to play that game because it's a hardcore simulation. Not many people want to deal with the steep learning curve.
,alcluizPT,2011-09-22T19:40Z,This game can't be played on Win 7 x64
