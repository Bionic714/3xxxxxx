,Duane420,2011-02-18T19:30Z,"Does ANYBODY have any Big Mama Thorton? I would LOVE to have some other than just ""Hound Dog"" I can find THAT anywhere. I would also LOVE some Esqurita and some of the more rare Screamin' Jay Hawkins. I seed as long as I can, but I can never find stuff I REALLY need, so if any of you people sitting on some rare stuff help an old audiophile put and I'll seed for at least two weeks what you send for me."
