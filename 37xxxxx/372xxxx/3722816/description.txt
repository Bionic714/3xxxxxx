The Lost Watch Screensaver is probably the most unusual 3D screensaver in the entire Internet. Timepieces are favorites of screensaver artists. But... you've never seen a pocket watch like this. It's an exact replica of 18th century Abraham-Louis Breguet's timepiece, made by a man who is often called the greatest genius of watchmaking that ever lived. And the best part - that's not the point.



An absent-minded traveler dropped his golden pocket watch while crossing a river. A few coins fell out as well. Years went by, but the timepiece is still working just fine even though there is no one to wind it up. So here it lies on the bottom of the river, with sun bleaks playing with clocks hands. 



This is exactly the picture I saw during my California vacation in the Sierra Mountains near Auburn last spring. I was so stunned by how beautiful it was I decided to create a screensaver about it. So now you can see it too.
