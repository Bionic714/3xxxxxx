According to Bob Colacello, the idea for KISS - close-ups of couples kissing each other for three minutes each - came from the old Hayes Office regulation forbidding actors in movies from touching lips for more than three seconds.

While the final version of Kiss runs some fifty minutes (and depicts a variety of couples engaged in the romantic act), it was originally shown as an avant-garde "serial"?with each "episode" focusing on one pair of lovers and lasting only four minutes. It is the calculated "primitivism" of this work that looks back toward the 1890s and the films of such French documentarists as Auguste and Louis Lumiere. In the United States, Thomas Alva Edison?s company also produced short, non-fiction subjects.
