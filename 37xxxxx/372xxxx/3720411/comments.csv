,jennysalala,2007-06-24T00:02Z,"I posted how to activate the game in XP.

Copy the mf.dll provided by the Loader.exe into your WINDOWS/system32 folder (e.g. C:\WINDOWS\system32).

Then copy the mf.dll provided by Razor1911 into your Halo 2 folder and play. Halo 2 is now activated like in Vista!"
,jennysalala,2007-06-24T00:06Z,"@azamba89: I found a work around. It's just a bug with XP.

I had this problem, your maps now have odd file extensions so Halo 2 sits there doing nothing like a lemon because it can't find the files it is supposed to read, possibly a bug, go to your maps folder and change all the file extensions of the maps to "".map"" instead of "".maptmp""

If it says ""please insert disk"" after you have done that, you will need to completely nuke halo 2 vista from your system (all reg entries, hidden folders .ect.) then reinstall it, that method worked for me., if you do not completely nuke it, the install will complain about it still being on your computer and telling you to click play)

something that makes nuking it harder is the fact that halo 2 will not uninstall on XP so you need to manually track down all of it's files and reg entries then delete them.

I recommend CCleaner, that will kill some things, but you will need to find the rest yourself."
,Jerico,2007-06-24T02:02Z,"Is there away to change to default install directory, since my c: drive doesn't have the space Halo 2 needs....when I click change directory and select one of my larger partitions, it just tells me there isn't enough space even thou there is."

,jennysalala,2007-06-24T03:16Z,"Also there's another entry in registry you have to delete.

Tried all that, still says that the game's already installed.  Guess there's something somewhere else - at this point it's looking like a reformat/reinstall is the only option - and that's kinda overkill for one game.

Ah well - anyone know when Overlord'll be available on TPB? :)"
,draco7891,2007-06-24T09:58Z,"Works until ""Gravemind"" level. Then I get an ""Insert Original Disc"" error. Seems they added some level-side protection, as all levels previous to that worked flawlessly.

For those with installation troubles: think harder about the options given to you. Installing the game is like a tiny puzzle unto itself, but anyone can do it. Just think beyond trying to find a direct install link. Remember that Microsoft's idea of ""repair"" is ""copy all the original files again"", and that trying to click things that say ""customize installation options"" is generally a good start. ;)"

To activate in XP 

1.copy the MF.DLL from the Loader.exe package (WoWLoader0.2) into your WINDOWS\system32 folder (C:\WINDOWS\system32\)

then extract them using unGZIP (its only a very simple programm) and there is no progress bar, so be sure that it is finished

then you have the maps and they are named like this

01a_tutorial.map_ungziped.dtz

then change the ending to .map 

01a_tutorial.map

,hiker13526,2007-06-28T18:53Z,"Rusher18: My solution solves that problem. The problem is that Halo has these temp files, which are meant to be placeholders for the real map files which will be streamed to the disk while you play. When you go to load the first level, Halo only has temp files to load, and thus just sits there. Simply renaming these temp files will cause the 1/3 Halo loading problem, since when it tries to load the placeholder (it's just a blank file) it fails and says you need to insert your halo 2 disc. All these problems are solved by doing the custom full install."

,hiker13526,2007-07-01T03:24Z,Can anyone run a crc check on their highcharity/gravemind extracted level? I'm still having problems with it. The crc I'm getting for 07a_highcharity.map is b56dde0e.
,hiker13526,2007-07-01T04:45Z,"I figured out the gravemind problem!!!

I believe it is Razor's fault. All the other maps work fine, except gravemind. For those stuck on gravemind using razor's release, it just plain won't work. What you can do, however, is skip gravemind.

1) Move all your maps from C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Halo 2\maps to a different folder. Leave the fonts folder where it is.
2) Move mainmenu.map, single_player_share.map, shared.map, 07b_forerunnership.map, 08a_deltacliffs.map, and 08b_deltacontrol.map back into the program files map folder. Basically, you moved every map to a different folder, and now you are moving back the maps you need.
3) Rename the following:
07b_forerunnership.map -> 00a_introduction.map
08a_deltacliffs.map -> 01a_tutorial.map
08b_deltacontrol.map -> 01b_spacestation.map
3) Start the game, and when it asks if you want to resume the campaign, hit Star New Level, and start from the beginning. Alternatively, you can Start a new profile and have it start from the beginning, which will actually start from after gravemind.

So, gravemind isn't actually fixed, but you can still finish the game."

,pete1505,2007-07-01T22:47Z,"Another way to get past the gravemind problem is get the ""halo 2 vista patch"" off mininova. You just run the last batch file (highest numbered) and it resets the levels so that you get the last three levels when you click on the first three levels. You dont get to play gravemind, but oh, well. It works to bypass activation, too, but you have to use all the batch files in order to do that. "

,Slimedude1,2007-07-11T02:28Z,"I found this on Usenet a few days ago, and damned if it didn't work.
:)
-----------------------------------------

I found a workaround for the gravemind level in Halo 2 on XP, by accident, and it works for me.

Most, if not all folks running Halo 2 on XP are running the XP loader authored by abcba (it can be found here on usenet and on the torrents in one form or another) but cannot get past the Gravemind level (level 12).
People have tried renaming and reordering the map files to no avail and even folks running Vista have had problems at this level.

	I was running a program called File Monitor, (available here http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/FileAndDisk/Filemon.mspx)
while loading the level to see what files were being accessed (maybe something was missing I thought)  and partway through loading the level, I got a ""insufficient resources"" tag returned while accessing the High charity map.  for yucks and grins, I downloaded the process monitor from the same site (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/FileAndDisk/processmonitor.mspx) and ran it while the level loaded to see what might be wrong.  To my surprise, it loaded! It takes a few minutes for it to happen, but the level does load!

I don't have a clue as to why this works, but it did :)


here's the procedure.

install Halo 2 using the abcba loader and get it configured and running on XP (there's plenty of info on this on the net, use google)

download and install Process Monitor (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/FileAndDisk/processmonitor.mspx)

play the game until you get to the gravemind level, as the level tries to load you will get the message ""Sorry, insert you original Halo 2 disk""
(inserting either the original or any other disk does nothing since the drive is never accessed).

close and restart the game and let it get to the main menu screen.

hit the windows key on the keyboard to minimize the game and open process monitor, let it run and monitor processes (the list wil fill rapidly).

Click on the Halo 2 icon in the taskbar to re-maximize the game.

click on ""Campaign"".   Do not resume, select new and then select the gravemind level. 

Let it load (It will take awile because process monitor is slowing it down).  Don't wory about missing the intro Video, once the level loads, it can be restarted from within the level.

Once it loads and starts, (wait for the intro to finish) minimize with the windows key again and close the Process monitor.

Re-maximize the level, hit the escape key and select restart the level (if you want to see the intro again).  The level can be reloaded from checkpoints as long as you are within the level, if you quit the level for any reason, you will have to run the Process Monitor again while the level loads.
You can load a saved checkpoint in this manner, so you don't have to complete the level at one sitting.

I am using this torrent and it worked fine for the first three levels when you were out in space but, before Outskirts starts, it gives me that error.
