,zronnyz,2008-10-23T20:53Z,"tzongue: thank you for this and all of your other torrents. after downloading this and a few other afx i was missing from you, i realized i loved every single one your torrents so i downloaded them all. you made me fall in love with Fridge. amazing stuff. you haven't uploaded anything since 2007. please change this. thanks."
,tzongue,2008-10-24T08:28Z,"zronnyz: wow, fancy that I check my upload comments 1 day after you leave a message.  I never use PB anymore, since joining a private torrent community.  You've inspired me to change my ways, though, and I want to spread the musical love.  I left a longer message on your Theramin upload... but yeah, if you have any specific requests, leave it here.  the gak message board.  I'll start by uploading the rest of the fridge albums, as soon as they finish downloading.  Unfortunately I just lost about 250Gb of music, partially, when my hard drive started going bad... fortunately the torrent protocol is smart enough to piece the files back together.  and thanks for your uploads, esp. the theramin in lossless!  I'm going to upload it to Waffles.fm, get some ratio credit. cheers."
