,zeiderguy,2007-06-25T20:39Z,"lol dimmu got owned!!!
but you should upload at least the 96' version of Stormblast. That scream in the beginning of Alt Lys Er Svunnet Hen is undeniably one of the best ever. Good upload thx."
,sp3tt,2007-06-26T00:15Z,Note: please seed.
,bruderlein,2007-06-26T00:36Z,"Hehehe, tack sp3tt. "
,AngelDuzt,2007-06-29T20:03Z,Just wanna say Thnx  :)
,Chimairo,2007-07-01T01:34Z,"Dimmu Borgir are not included. This is a black metal torrent.)	

well... that is a load of crap!
Dimmu borgir is black metal!

and you're calling Satyricon black... the early stuff maybe, but now.. NO. ...anyhoo..."
,corbou,2007-07-02T12:40Z,Eh!
,OliverKjaerulff,2007-07-04T12:05Z,"Dimmu Borgir is more black, than Ulver and Limbonic Art."
,Krisiun,2007-07-10T02:07Z,"First of all great torrent, thx for the upload! (allthough I already have all the CDs ; )

As for the essential part, many newer CDs can´t really be considered ""essential""? No one in their right mind can think that highly of e.g. Mayhem´s ""Grand Declaration of War"" or Darkthone´s ""Plaguewielder""....?

I´d rather include some Dimmu Borgir. Yes the old stuff are black metal and essential too! As are other mid 90´s releases from bands like Ancient, Gehenna, Kvist,...hell, even Borknagar and Enslaved. Perhaps some Khold, Furze,...

But instead of whining like a bitch I´ll put some up later and urge others to do the same!

Thx again, sp3tt!

,half evil333,2007-07-24T23:50Z,"when i see this then i know its only norwegian pepole that know what black metal is!


you wannabes"

,Taugina,2007-07-25T08:58Z,Awsome :) Keep it up.
,limbride,2007-07-28T07:21Z,"Ulver > Dimmu Crapnir.
"
,zeiderguy,2007-07-29T05:07Z,"""Ulver > Dimmu Crapnir""

of course Ulver is > Dimmu

but to say that Dimmu is not black metal, sure, they sold out a bit, but their old stuff is black, blacker than the blackest black x INFINITY!!!

(dont forget about industrial/electronic shit Ulver was pumping out a few years back)"
,Delerium777,2007-08-06T18:13Z,great scene releases
,Depressure,2007-08-13T16:29Z,anybody got all the files and wanna seed??
,EspenExcluzive,2007-08-15T20:19Z,Why isn't Dimmu Borgir here?? Rediculous. Gives a big minus to the torrent.
,sp3tt,2007-08-16T03:35Z,As was said in the infobox: because it's a black metal torrent.
,PerfectTool,2007-08-19T02:53Z,get a life you fucking lame prick. everybody that make a search for dimmu will get this torent listed. just to be confronted with the arrogance of a no lifer. fuck you!
,Splittongue,2007-09-15T03:48Z,"Nice fucking torrent! I figured since everyone was arguing about what's what I would take this chance to point you guys to http://www.einsatzkommando.org/ for some good black metal. Not to mention the demo section. Anyways, this torrent was a great find. It's so hard to find any music worth listening to anymore....trend driven shit is all I see anymore."
,CarrionShine666,2007-09-27T21:13Z,"Come on, anyone who thinks Dimmu Borgir is truly Black Metal is retarded. Im not saying theyre bad, just that Dimmu is satanic death metal. They dont stay with the basics of black metal. They use alot of synth and keys in their music. I am a big fan of DB but if you want them to be in a torrent like this try to find one titled ""Essential Norweigan DEATH Metal"" im sure youll find it in there."
,mariustrh,2007-10-19T00:24Z,"Dimmu is great, and show is all those bands. Show thank U Sp3tt :o) No I'm gonna get Dimmu as well :o)

  Thanx "
,Kvnt,2007-10-29T16:33Z,"All this sucks, except from Burzum, and early Darkthrone, don't like them though.
It's all commercial shit, and I'm surprised you didn't put Demon Burger with it.


Especially Immortal, Satyricon and Mayhem are horrible.

But I think I'll do as Krisiun,
quit my whining, and upload some trve BM instead."
,Kvnt,2007-10-29T16:34Z,"Good .torrent though, at least it's better than what most other call BM here."
,Kvnt,2007-10-29T16:37Z,"And to Zeiderguy;

Ulver is shit too."
,sjørøver-ole,2007-11-29T18:15Z,"Just stop whining... download what you want, and leave the rest and shut up... easier.

But its weird that Dimmu Borgir is not included when Satyricon with Volcano -AND- ""Now, Diabolical"" is in this torrent:P Anyway, I give a damn, I download only what I dont have allready:P"
,A.O.T,2007-12-02T23:12Z,"I get a good laugh over the whining about how Dimmu is not included, the reason is pretty simple too: This is not a symphonic black metal album. I do feel like ""For All Tid"" should be included, but as I legally own that album I don't give a crap. Also please stop creating new genres CarrionShine666, most black metal is satanic. Except a few, but the ones I can think of right now revolves around Norse mythology, so from a Christian point of view they are still blasphemic.

This torrent is pretty well composed, I would like to see some less familiar bands but then again I fear for some to become ""cool black metal"" that people listen to just to listen to. 4/5 stars from me!"
,theSquiggly,2007-12-06T20:53Z,"Hehehe... I get a good laugh from all that bickering about ""Black"" or ""Death"" or ""Teutonic mesh"" or ""whatschamakallit""...
It's a great release with a great many classic albums (no matter what genre) and I'm DL'ing the ones I want...
And just for the hell of it: 
Ulver's electronic ""ambient""-album is both interesting, well composed and atmospheric, and if you lot (the lot that right about now are foaming at the mouth) can't hear that then you've got about as open a mind as the Guardians of Christian Fate (the ones you so despise) have! 
:'P 
Bah!
Thanx alot for the torrent, sp3tt!!"
,jonathanblackvarg,2007-12-10T13:37Z,Wow! Gonna download this in some days
,Viriatus,2007-12-11T17:53Z,"1349 should be removed and Enslaved included. Enslaved is essential, 1349 is just the same formula developed a few years ago."
,jonathanblackvarg,2007-12-13T15:08Z,"Just one thing: why is Immortal ""Sons of northern darkness"" in the torrent? That one is too new to be a classic. But so what if it is some idiotic albums here? Its lots of good albums too! (Dimmu Borgir should have been here)."
,jonathanblackvarg,2007-12-13T15:09Z,"You're right, Viriatus. Remove 1349 and include Enslaved."
,jonathanblackvarg,2007-12-13T15:10Z,"You're right, Viritaus. 1349 should've been removed and Enslaved included."
,jonathanblackvarg,2007-12-13T15:12Z,"But that's not a problem: I searched now, and it is some Enslaved torrents on this site."
,jonathanblackvarg,2007-12-14T16:00Z,Hi sp3tt. I start to download some of your blackmetal albums now. It's very slow. Can somebody seed? Would be great

,corpser,2008-01-02T21:28Z,real blackmetal guys dont steal music
,Eilertso,2008-01-19T09:38Z,I was really hoping you would include Kvist here
,Igrenn,2008-01-27T19:56Z,"pfft, only Burzum and Gorgoroth should be here^^ lol
"" noo it is blackened hippie thrash metal over black through Death..."" 
CarrionShine666, i Get goosebumps when I read your comment... Btw the reason why I am writing is cuz of I wanted to ask if any1 could put up Dimension F3h album? thx"
,Igrenn,2008-01-27T19:59Z,"Oops gorg was included.... rofl well well, and corpser... we are not all rich, Why don't you buy the albums for us then?"
,finsterkoenigstan,2008-01-30T07:42Z,"Oh, for fuck's sake, quit bitching and download Dimmu and/or Enslaved/Khold/whoever you feel was slighted by not being included. Or, *gasp*, make your own torrent and include your favorite albums. I love black metal, but black metallers who act like their opinion is the ""gospel truth"" make me want to go listen to techno out of spite. "
,david1,2008-03-08T20:28Z,"Awesome!  I already have most of these, but some I haven't heard before (shame on me).   I'm thinking about making my own torrent with black metal stuff I like, but then idiots will complain and I will cry. Keep rocking in the free world all losers out there"

,Gargoth666,2008-06-11T20:08Z,"symphonic or not, its still black metal anyway."
,motorhead1,2008-06-15T15:30Z,*sniff*. DAMN. had this on my list of seeding whne i accidently deleted it and all of its contents. have to download again now.
,ScreenSuch,2008-07-02T23:41Z,Are you INSANE?! 1349 excluded? They're like  the hardest black metal there is. 2nd. wave! You can't exclude that! It's true black metal.
,MisplacedFate1313,2008-07-10T17:59Z,Good torrent. Dimmu should've been on it.
,bubbared,2008-07-31T19:45Z,"Awesome torrent, thanks tons.  I'll seed this for a long ass time. *devil horns*"
,Mysticum81,2008-08-28T15:57Z,"Haha, I love how trendy it is to hate Dimmu Borgir. Of course they should be included. The original Stormblåst is one of the finest black metal albums ever recorded. Idiot."
,Master-0f-God,2008-09-13T12:00Z,"Jesus fuckin Christ, so much whining here. Great torrent, an ill bet there wouldnt have been any of this ""Wheres Dimmu Borgir?"" if it hadnt said ""no Dimmu Borgir""."
,Maanegahl,2008-10-01T08:44Z,"Let me see. . .
No Dimmu Borgir, cuz they are not black metal you say? Well, what's more black metal; old Dimmu Borgir or the newer Satyricon?

Dimmu Borgir has allways been, and will most likely allways be a black metal band. There is a difference between old school black metal and symphonic black metal. Cunt. . ."
,unreal,2008-10-08T22:34Z,"Haha I have got to laugh. The old ""I know best what black metal is"" discussion. The only thing I have to say is: BM or not BM has to do with more than music. It´s as much about attitude Personally I think Fenriz definition is very close to my own. Today the best (old school) BM is found outside of Scandinavia anyway. Vargsang - Werewolf Of Wysteria is a good example of one of those excellent albums. Go get it!"
,haggisthescot,2008-10-11T19:03Z,"""Haha, I love how trendy it is to hate Dimmu Borgir.""
This. Well put Mysticum81.

You don't see me running around yelling I HATE SLAYER even though I reckon they went a bit shit after about 1993, you don't see me running around yelling I HATE METALLICA even though I reckon they went a bit shit after the 1980s, what the fuck makes DB so different? 

So their last few releases have been so highly polished and wanky that they barely sound like metal anymore, but I'll be fucked if I'm gonna throw out Stormblast, Godless Savage Garden or Enthrone Darkness Triumphant just cos a bunch of elitist scene kids think its uncool to like a band just because they've become popular. Fuck off."
[T],doktor_zook,2009-01-04T10:13Z,Lot's of fun comments.
,YEZZUUH,2009-02-04T20:40Z,"uhm, dude, Dimmu Borgir IS Black metal!!"
,Devestator,2009-02-15T12:38Z,A black metal torrent including mayhem with their drummer who got married in a christian church - how very fucking true to the ideas of black metal!!
,gaddegutt,2009-04-07T01:31Z,"NO! Dimmu Borgir is not true Black Metal!! Dimmu Borgir is a symphonic heavy metal band. The only common thing they have with black metal is their belifes. They admitt themself that they dont preform black metal! So listen you retared mainstream musican and do some reasearch. 
The media call them black metal preformers but the media dont know shit! Ask the true norwegian bm artist. 


Dimmu Borgir is a more a band who focuses on the audience and not the message, atmosphere and feeling.

This is a exellent collection of TRUE Norwegian Black Metal. "
,gaddegutt,2009-04-07T01:33Z,"But Satyricon's newest albumst have nothing to do here. They are following Dimmus style and creates more kind and easy music. thats not bm

"
,gaddegutt,2009-04-07T01:36Z,"If you read this whole commet listing you guys will see how stupid and out of sense som of these ""wannabe black metal's"" who thinks Dimmu Borgir is TNBM. 
you behave like 12year old kids."

,SamFisher440,2009-05-08T08:13Z,"Thanks for the up!

And one thing I would like to ask is...

Where's ABSU?

I wonder sometimes how many people actually know of this very great band. I never here people talking about them, but...there music is the best I've ever heard.

Main fav songs are, Morbid Scream, Highland Tyrant Attack, Pillars of Mercy, The Winter Zephyr has a kick ass drum beat and nearly their entire albums. 

I'll admit, some albums are more death, some are more thrash, but they are still a fucking awesome black metal band.

But...this is still a great up. So thanks again.
"
,SamFisher440,2009-05-08T08:26Z,"Oh and about Dimmu Borgir, they sold out. They've made it mainstream, which isn't what black metal is about. It's not meant to be for everyone, or near everyone. They've added a more hardcore sound to it. And I'm anti-hardcore

Even Mayhem has started to spread from their roots. Music evolves, we can't do anything to change that. And we all remember where Black Metal started right? Venom started black metal. 


"
,ricky4502,2009-05-12T20:34Z,ok it's bad enough there's no dimmu but no cradle of filth either? wtf?
,ricky4502,2009-05-12T20:36Z,"it's bad enough dimmu isn't on here, they're symphonic black metal which whether you like it or not is still a subgenre of black metal

great torrent though"
,unidiot2002,2009-06-21T21:17Z,"@ricky5402 and slytanicus: You fucking dildos, Cradle of Filth is neither Norwegian nor black metal. You'll notice that the torrent is for NORWEGIAN BLACK METAL.

,dead2you,2009-07-31T00:50Z,"Dimmu has done alot for black metal, good and bad. Yes now they are symphonic black metal, that we all can agree on. I do think there early stuff should have been included in this torrent though. Now about Cradle of Filth, there early work is true old school black metal wheather you like it or not. But as far as the torrent goes they are from England, and not of Norwegian decent. All and all great torrent for some classic black metal. thanks for the upload!!!!"
