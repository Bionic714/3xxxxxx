,Brian1454,2009-09-27T20:36Z,"noob cracker or total retard, read the following .txt document what was in the map:
well this is NO VIRUS or TROJAN... believe it or not, THIS IS NEEDED to

get copied games work correctly... therefor if you(or your virus tool) has deleted

this install.exe (toed.exe) file. then you dont have this game running 100% ....

btw. often it happens these toed.exe files are important to get a serial key

or any other kind of > install instructions < about the release can be read there.

therefor you can believe me  , when iam saying THIS aint be malware or

what-so-ever.... iam a programming freak, and do really hate those things as

you might never will. ... iam a bit pissed about all these attacks lately... 

virus/trojans etc. ppl should get a life, instead complaining all day long...

atleast they could say Thanks for the up, or what-fukken-soever they can do.

thank you for reading this, and the excuse for my bad english writings are written

often enuff.... so lets take things a bit easier nowadays... its ALL FOR FREE you 

should always remind!



in short: this is a virus"
