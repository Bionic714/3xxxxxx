,the-dude82,2009-11-27T23:35Z,"no seeding?!
i realy wanna watch it :)
as for haters suck it,i dont give a fuck what he did to his  personal life,i'll remember his as a wrestler,a wrestling machine  "
,lizzi6692,2010-01-02T06:36Z,"for all people that feel the need to badmouth benoit STFU.  It was proven that because of all the concussions he had sustained from entertaining the fans, INCLUDING YOU, that he could not be held responsible for his actions.  He had the brain functionality of an 80 year old man with dementia, he had no idea what he was doing.  He should be remembered for being the best technical wrestler in the business, not for a crime he didn't realize he was committing."
,guarino2002,2010-03-19T05:52Z,"Even though his brain was pretty much destroyed mostly from the all the chair shots and his finishing move the diving head butt (im sure that really didnt help lol). Everyone around him said he was coherent and even made his dr appointment. Hell if he would have made the ppv that sunday of the weekend he died, he would have won the belt. He knew dam well what he was doing. And he also had a history of spousal abuse well before that happened. So kinda screw chris. He was one of the best wrestlers though, but so was steve austin and in my eyes thats just another pos wife beater that should disappear. "
,the-dude82,2010-03-19T14:28Z,"guarino2002 why dont you eat shit & shut the fuck.
wtf is this wife beater shit has to do with that??!!
grow some brain you fucking hater i wish you disappear retard ;)"
,the-dude82,2010-03-19T14:31Z,"& why the fuck is no seeding,i'm trying to download it again this time :(
i wanna see it for god sake please seed you noobs."
,Therrito,2011-01-01T21:15Z,guarino2002 is correct. It was all of the flying head butts and chair shots that messed up his brain. Have you forgotten when Chris Benoit won the World Heavyweight Title in Wrestlemania XX? the-dude82 is the one that needs to stfu
,nesperi,2011-12-21T19:21Z,Thank you
,MrToplad,2012-06-13T12:21Z,"Muppet's like you megatonse, forget about what he did in the ring. Only see him as a family killer.

I have 1 word for you.... CLOWN"
