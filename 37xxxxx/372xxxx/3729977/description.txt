Our country was torn in half. God-fearing Generals led their men by the thousands
into ferocious battles.  In Gods and Generals the game, you are on the front line.  
As a Company Captain you lead your men in recreations of battle scenes from the 
movie. 

For you the pressure is even more intense.  Because of the confidence your Generals 
have in you, they rely on you to execute special missions that will shorten each battle
and reduce casualties. Fortunately, they also make sure you have the latest in advanced 
weaponry and the best troops in your Company.  Unfortunately, you may encounter your 
best friend across the battlefield.
