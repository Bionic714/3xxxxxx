We had a system problem which will force us to restore everything from backup.
The disks are pretty much empty right now and until we are able to upload the backup and set up everything up, we have to close down.

We.ll be back as soon as possible. Sorry for the inconvenience.

We were planning on returning online in the next few hours - probably tomorrow afternoon. But due some recent events, and following the advice of a lot of you, we will make a few more changes that might take a few days longer. As always, thanks for you continued support and patience. For the ones wondering, the timing of the downtime was coincidental.

Edit: We are currently performing some changes to the servers. Complete blackouts are to be expected.

July 1

There was a delay with our new hardware that pushes the site return for Wednesday.
The Forums are now back online though."

,Pantz0r,2009-06-03T02:01Z,"This game is indeed very bad but my friend bought it for ÂŁ0.07 as a joke and we found that it was one of the best drinking games we'd come across.

Basic Drinking Game Rules:
Kill an enemy = 1 finger for all
Kill an enemy with a headshot = 3 fingers for all
Completed level = Everyone but the player downs their drink.
Enemy kills you = Player downs his drink and a new player is selected.

Please seed as I've been trying to get hold of it for ages, am stuck on 39.9%."
