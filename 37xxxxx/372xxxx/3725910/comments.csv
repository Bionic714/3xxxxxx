[V],Kuthumi,2007-06-28T08:36Z,"RubberTow, you have uploaded 12 films in 48 hours and not seeded any of them. This one you have uploaded once before. Do you understand how this system works?  "
,RubberTow,2007-07-26T04:43Z,"Kuthumi, I was learning. And I was at that time seeding all of them, still am in fact. If I successfully uploaded it, then I was seeding it, but it took awhile. Admittedly There are a few broken ones that I was trying to do in groups and then decided not to because I didn't realize how it worked and what I was doing until I got booted off Mini Nova for it. The movies from the files, however, are still being seeded. It is a slow process until it starts getting uploaded from peers. nothing is uploaded from me faster than 1 kbps. that's because I keep my overall upload speed down to 30. and that is because if I go above 30, it severly slows down my downloading for some reason.

,riotpirat,2008-06-24T04:45Z,if this is the original i love you
,moreisless,2009-08-20T03:22Z,Yes! I love you too. The remake is total crap but this is amazing. I have it on VHS but it's just gathering dust; better to share such a work of complete genius. Always always; if it has not many seeds it will always be superior. some tips on uploading would be welcome; I'm new to all this.
