
Outrageous Fortune (2005-)



Outrageous Fortune is one of New Zealand's top dramas. The Wests are a one-family crime wave with a proud tradition in thievery, larceny and petty crime, until now. When patriarch Wolfgang West is sentenced to four years in jail, his wife Cheryl decides enough is enough; the family are cleaning up their act and going straight. Can the Wests live up to Cheryl's resolve and stay out of crime? It's not easy to be a saint when you have the DNA of a sinner.

Outrageous Fortune follows one cheerfully trashy crime family's attempts to stay out of trouble: matriarch Cheryl, determined to save her brood from following in their father's footsteps, eldest son Jethro, an ambitious lawyer-to-be with a few secrets, Jethro's twin Van (identical except in the brains department) who only wants to be like his dad, 18-year-old Pascalle, who wants to be Rachel Hunter, 15-year-old movie buff Loretta, who is blackmailing her teacher, and Grandpa Ted, who may have Alzheimer's - unless he's just playing it up to annoy people.

Then there's Detective Sergeant Wayne Judd, the West family nemesis; the Hongs, a wealthy Asian family who may or may not have Triad connections, Caroline Darling, Loretta's deputy principal, who has been having an affair with Jethro since he was a 15-year-old student, Munter, Van's best mate and partner in crime, and Wolf himself, who does not intend to take his wife's sudden wave of righteousness lying down.

Outrageous Fortune is a family comedy-drama about the wrong sort of people trying to do the right thing when the rewards for going straight are neither immediate nor bountiful. Outrageous Fortune is a bold, fresh comedy-drama which is by turns bawdy, action-packed, satirical and trashy - but only ever a heartbeat away from reality.

Seeders notes and request for help with Season 2;

big thanks to the original ripper/s, and diwana.org andfor bt releasing and to those people that have been seeding keeping them alive.

Season 3 is in production and dvd's are available for season 1 and 2 but I couldn't find them already in fileshareland. If anyone can find or rip those it would be much better to share than these tv captures.
Although they are ok quality and definately watchable but season 1 has edited audio to remove the swearing for tv. .... stink one!!

I will start with bringing season 1 public, I made one torrent for the full series but you can still download them as single eps if you prefer by adjusting the settings in your client.
I am currently still getting season 2 but they are divx rips on the tracker at diwana that are a little bit glitchy in parts and not as good as the xvid captures, .. and they are missing a couple of episodes :(
Season 2 xvid rips were posted to usenet but dated 67 days ago so no longer available on my isp's usenet provider. If anyone with a proper account can get the xvid rips before they get pushed off the usenet servers that would be fantastic. Giganews claims to now have 120 days retention for the binary groups, 101 days with usenetserver, other servers with approx 70 days; newshosting, usenet-news,newsfusion
You can find nzb's for easy downloading from the newsgroups if you do a search at at nzb-chat or binsearch.info

I will help out if you want a hand releasing them on p2p, please contact me if needed, or I won't say no to anyone that wants to donate or share a usenet account with me - anything from a one off block account to unlimited access will be happily accepted and then I will share on the p2p networks. TIA.
