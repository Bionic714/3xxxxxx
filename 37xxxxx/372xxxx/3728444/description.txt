Historical Documents of the United States

Included are the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the remaining amendments to the Constitution.  In both high-resolution images and textual form.

I am creating this torrent for the purpose of reminding the United States and hopefully the world of the freedoms we've lost, and the values our founding fathers actually had.  Most people have never even read these documents, much less understood what they represent.  It's about time that changed.

Spread the freedom virus!
