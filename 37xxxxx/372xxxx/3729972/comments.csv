,drew1982,2007-07-02T19:31Z,I'm liking what I hear so far.  I was doubting this album after hearing Tarantula but I'm really enjoying it so far.  Thanks!
,Wezzor,2007-07-03T13:17Z,Indeed. Corgan really did put his heart and soul into this one..again thanx
,got_me_our_urs,2007-07-03T23:53Z,"great quality. pretty good album, i dont think it stands up very tall to the other albums, but still good. a tad dissapointed"
,got_me_our_urs,2007-07-03T23:55Z,"when someone gets it, release this with the ""bonus tracks"". there will be diff versions of the cd when its realised that have different songs"
,Beeeye,2007-07-04T14:09Z,Being a 12 year pumpkins fan........... disappointed. Most of it is better than Tarantula. Billy Corgan really has to stop producing their albums. Thanks for sharing
,mokie,2007-07-06T16:24Z,This album sucks!! But ty anyway
,joshua_85,2007-07-09T14:33Z,"Beeeye, Corgan didn't produce this album. It is produced by Terry Date and Roy Thomas Baker, who is known for producing Queen."
