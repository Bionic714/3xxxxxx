http://wow.dethpod.com 

or at 

http://wow.dethpod.com/guide.php 

Download the game faster directy from blizzard and then you know theres no keyloggers/virus crap, patch it to current version using the launcher.exe change the realmlist.wtf file to read ""set realmlist wow.dethpod.com"" (without quotes) and your done. This server is Free, with a great bunch of people.

============================

This server really sucks.
Tons of bugged talents/spells/quests.
Uptime is an absolute joke.  Crashes constantly.
Don't be lazy and join this server, look for a good one.
