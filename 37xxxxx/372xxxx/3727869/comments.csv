,420dopeman,2007-06-29T18:34Z,**ammended notes above**
,cliffne,2007-06-30T09:38Z,Don't work for me and my system specs easily match what it needs.  After unzipping the file with Winrar i double clicked on the setup icon to install the reg files.  Then when i try to run the game from double clicking on the DiRT.exe file i always get the message saying DiRT has encountered a problem and needs to close.  Anybody have any ideas?
,420dopeman,2007-06-30T12:51Z,"**same link as the ammended notes above, always read carfully the descriptioon. **

This is for you, if you have same problem as I had :

At the beginning i had first one problem : I had 2 missing files (.dll files) . Then i downloaded the files on www.dll-files.com . Then i had the game working, but it was the huge lag, because my computer did not match with the speeccs needed . Then The_Sauce_22 came with an idea, to make it work nice . I followed that advice, to put the game on an harddisk alone.

 Greetings fellow pirates.

 There is indeed a new enemy amongst torrents and they are trying to control
 all good gaming torrents everywhere. Leeching and dumping data, not sharing
 a bit of data, which is making it near impossible to download many torrents.

 I have included a dopeman_blocklist.txt file. YOU MUST load this file to
 Peerguardian as an addtional blocklist -or- load the file to whatever means
 of IP blocking you have available to your BT Client.

 If you do not, you will simply be sharing data to these cowards and not other
 legit torrent users trying to download. 

 Please try to understand the importance of this. It must be used to begin
 saving game torrents everywhere. This is a new enemy. We must do our best 
 to fight back to preserve our freedom of sharing. 

 Please use the blocklist and share it anyway you can.

I'm using Vista Ultimate 32Bit, E6750 C2D @ 3.2Ghz, 4G DDR2 1066Mhz, 3.2GB listed, Gigabyte P35-DS3R, BFG 8800 GTS 640 GTS. 

I've tried using the No intro fix thingy, doesn't work. "
,Lasher,2008-01-19T20:19Z,"Got it working, I guess i never applied the no intro fix properly before. 

runs fine for me, a little bit of slowdown with multiple cars, but it's ok.

as for the 8600, it's not as bad as the first dude was saying but it is pretty shit, the last series X600 card was good, this generation is shit compaired to the 88s, but i imagine the 9600 will be a great card.

as for playing crysis on high with a 8600, you must get quite a bit of slowdown on some levels, but generally it should play fine. 

for me crysis runs flawlessly with half the settings on v-high, and the other half on high. full object motion blur is a bit too much for my card to handle, especially with very high shaders enabled. "

for all who didn't get this to  work, because the screen just turns black and game exits

and to DOPEMAN and other people who have nVidia 8600 it works perfectly, dopeman just forgot to put the 8600gt there

hope it helped you who have problems running it!

Or if you have a 64 bit system;
c:\windows\SysWOW64\adi_oal.dll

to use the included 100% savegame & to be able to change options I had to change PATH_APPLICATION & SAVEGAMEDIR in setup.reg/the registry to my install dir.

also patching to v1.22 works (no crack/nocd needed afterwards!)

& most important the No-Intro-Fix #2 (GENiEBEN) from GCW (cmr_intro.bik & cmr_intro_us.bik in video folder) to fix the crash when launching the app. (binkw32.dll error)

after some effort I even configured my Logitech Rublepad 2 for playing (& for the Menu Navigation via Logitech Profiler)

so, thx for sharing!"

on a personal Sidenote -- Deleted 10 minutes after installing --  if you are a true fan of ""DIRT TRACK racing"" then this might be for you,  Your vehichle is 100% completely customizable for every track from the suspension to the tires toe angle to ground cleareance .. think EA's Nascar 2004/2005 where you can adjust the angle of the drivers teeth down to the 1/4 inch to make the car go faster or hold better in the corner --- were talking ""IN-DEPTH"". 

If this is the type of thing that appeals to you then this is the Game for you if you simply want to hop into a car and drive fast trying to learn a course without worrying if your car might not be setup right --  go with CodeMasters  GRID  ---  I DL'd torrent for Grid and promptly went and bought the game  -- I ALMOST paid for dirt as well without downloading because codemasters has my vote I am glad I didn't

,major9211,2009-12-08T20:12Z,"SAVE GAME CORRUPT PROBLEM SOLVED:

i am writing this step by step as the first comment was not understood by many.

situation:ur save game got corrupt.

1.open the folder where dirt is installed.
2.in that dirt folder open (save) folder.
3.in (save) folder open (savegame) folder.
4.now u can see folders as autosave0,autosave1...etc.
5.copy all autosave folders to desktop.
6.now if the real autosaves were (autosave0),(autosave1),u rename them to (autosave2),and (autosave3).
7.copy them back to the dirt save game folder.

note:initially u were having only (autosave0) and (autosave1),now u r having autosave0,autosave1,autosave2,and autosave3.

now,they r the same saves copied by the diffrent name.

9.start the game( if )ur profile is not auto loaded or it asks to creat a new profile creat a new profile. 

10.go to options and try to change profiles,u will see that now u have 2 profiles with the same names but diffrent numbers...one of them i think with the higher number will work,it will have the same achivments as ur corrupt profile.

note...note...note

I wrote the situation as it was in my pc,i was having 2 profiles,situation can be diffrent with u.
means if u r having only one profile,then u will have only (autosave0),which u will copy to desktop and rename it to (autosave1),and then copy it back to the folder savegame.
(dont be stupid...improvise). 

if u still dont get it then write me again and i will help u out for sure.

if ur problem is solved thank me at,and correct me so i can write a better help.
