Soundtrack to Russ Meyer's "Faster, Pusscyat! Kill! Kill!" Three sassy gogo dancers murder a car club square, kidnap his girlfriend, and search for a rumored fortune hidden in secluded ranch by a vengeful, misogynistic cripple.  Brash and brassy music score with some dialogue and sound effects mixed into it, including the opening voice-over monologue ode to violence and women.
