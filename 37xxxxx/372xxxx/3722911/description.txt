Earthed 4 - Death or Glory - reeks of the same handpicked juju juice-berries of previous Rankin releases, only it's even more focused. Featuring every World Cup round from 2006, from the sunny beaches of Brazil and Spain, to the drenched mountain-tops of Scotland and Quebec, the fine line between Death or Glory is so close you can taste it.
Having witnessed one of the most competitive years ever in the world of DH racing, to find those extra 100th seconds is harder than ever before, this film documents the speed and skill that the top pro riders have to find to stay on top of their game, and in some cases staying alive.
There are a host of other incredible highlights including Akrigg in Japan, DH in Innerleithen and the Isle of Skye, Hardtails and Short-travel bikes ruling at the Charge Jam, Welsh trail centres and Glentress. Plus for the first time ever, a section for ladies that will put most of the lads to shame - so be prepared. Death or Glory takes it right back to the roots of DH, with sessions in New Zealand, not to mention a classic World Champs event from the MTB mecca.

Enjoy and seed!
