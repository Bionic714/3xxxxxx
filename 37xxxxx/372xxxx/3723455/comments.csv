,Jibrilski,2007-08-05T14:29Z,Just so everyone knows this uses an older version of Rosetta Stone and doesnt work with V. 2... on top of that it didnt work for me it kept giving me a macromedia projector error. Kinda dissapointing but i cannot complain much since i got it fo free yadadamean?! :) There is plenty to choose from so I am going to try a different torrent.
