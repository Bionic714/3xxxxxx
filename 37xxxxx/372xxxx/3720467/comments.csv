,Dereke89,2007-06-24T11:18Z,What the fuck is wrong with the install? Why doesn't I get further than the fucking revolving shit!!
[V],Subzero!,2007-06-25T01:26Z,well then you didnt read everything...
,furyfreak96,2007-06-25T06:46Z,i am a super noob to downloading how do you un rar and also were is the directory someone please help
,furyfreak96,2007-06-25T07:23Z,"ok i think i figured part out but cant get to install
justshows brought by one eyed dude"
[V],Subzero!,2007-06-25T08:35Z,"the intro can be exit with esc spacebar or left mousebutton, then install should continue after!... be patience and wait....  when this is done
 make sure to copy crack/rtc3.exe to rollercoastertycoon3 main folder.... when asks for overwriting answer YES, and thats it, start game with rct3.exe"
,furyfreak96,2007-06-26T07:14Z,sorry to continue noob question but i have waited throught the whole thing and it said it was complete i cant start game it says no disc i could not figure out were or how to copy crack/rtc3.exe in main folder of game if anyone has patience for a novice download please help i am listening
[V],Subzero!,2007-06-27T22:03Z,"well... the folder called crack/ is in the same folder were the other extracted files are, go to this folder (crack)  right mousebutton on rct3.exe and choose copy....

then go back to the game folder (mainfolder) and paste this rct3.exe to it, there must be already the old original rct3.exe (the one saying insĂŠrt cd) when it asks for overwriting answer YES... and that it, alternativly use your windows search option (startmenu) and search for ""crack/rct3"" and copy / paste to gamefolder...."
,furyfreak96,2007-06-29T06:45Z,thank you subzero works great thank you for helping a noob one more question if its not too much of a bother. What is seeding and how can i do it i hear people speak of it like it helps leechers is this good or bad  i asume good once again thank you
[V],Subzero!,2007-06-30T15:57Z,"well seeding is when you have finished downloading to continue SEED for the other downloaders, when everbody would do this , we all could download much faster.... simply when you finished downloading , keep the torrent(connection) running for a few hours or a day...  upload rate set to the highest (use utorrent!)... thats all, and if you think now they have enuff downloaded, you stop the simple  stop the TORRENT , and disconnect... thats it... always share!... thats the way it should be! 

note to all the others....

dont dare to share!"

[V],Subzero!,2007-09-05T14:33Z,"@b0dyrem0ver

yo man, you must be real stupid if you think TOED.EXE and the other EXEs are Viruses!.

why dont you double click toed.exe ONCE!, THEN I Bet you  wont delete them anymore, Iam the programmer of them, and believe me iam not spreading or coding Viruses!...

and the other thing you should now is, that IF YOU DELETED the ToeD.exe , then IAM SURE, the game wont run fine to the end!... ya IT WONT be working 100% ! , be sure about!...

TOED.EXE warning is almost certainly a false positive alert from overly protective heuristics
you can read more about in your VirusTool-Manual or VirusTools-WebSite!.

,TurtleVVisperer,2007-12-16T18:09Z,"Works perfectly.  If you're having any problems, just read the instructions and any comments already on here and you'll figure it out.  Thanks for a great rip."
,TurtleVVisperer,2007-12-18T05:13Z,"After playing this for two days, I've decided the only flaw in the rip (but maybe it is just the original game's fault) is that the sounds don't always play.  This has been mentioned in another person's post I think.  It is the sounds for the rides, and the sounds of the people that don't play.  Other sounds, like when you click a button, build/demolish, and everything else plays though."
,jhonnyboy,2007-12-22T21:18Z,ok i ran the game-install.bat for about 15 mins and all i c is made by The one eyed dude for your pleasure for hours. Exactly how long are we suppose to wait? How do i install the game? Thanks in advance
,jhonnyboy,2007-12-22T22:23Z,"ok i noticed once you launch the program game install all the files in the rct3 folder appears. I have the rct3.exe it says insert disk, so i replaced it with the cracked one, but it says it has encountered an error. Please help. THanks sub!"
