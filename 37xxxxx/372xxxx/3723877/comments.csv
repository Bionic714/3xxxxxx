,TuplaKatt,2007-06-28T22:52Z,"I can't play any longer than Library. The Game says ""Sorry. Please insert your original Halo2 Disc."" Can anyone help me?"
,TheBabeLover,2007-06-29T20:35Z,"I had the problem with the gravemind level (wouldn´t load)

I unziped the mapfiles from the dvd and put them in the halo2\maps folder (used a program called UnGZIP, found it on the filefront forum)

http://files.filefront.com/UnGZIPexe/;7895795;;/fileinfo.html"
,TuplaKatt,2007-06-30T00:26Z,what do you mean? Could you please tell me how to do it. I've downloaded the unzipper.
,TheBabeLover,2007-06-30T01:13Z,"you need to copy them from dvd to the hdd (in another folder)

then extract them using unGZIP, there is no progress bar, so be sure that it is finished.

then you have the maps and they are named like f.ex.

01a_tutorial.map_ungziped.dtz

then change the ending to .map

01a_tutorial.map

and then copy them into halo2\maps

Find the map you want and unzip!"
,TuplaKatt,2007-06-30T15:30Z,"Still same problem. ""Insert original disc."" Is it cuz I have xp?"
,TuplaKatt,2007-06-30T15:33Z,Which one is the Gravedigger file?
,TheBabeLover,2007-06-30T19:23Z,"It's not because you have XP. I run it on XP and it runs fine. Copy all the map files (DVD), extract them, rename and copy them in the halo 2/map folder."
,Gonzalesss,2007-06-30T19:34Z,"Man , this is so fucked up ... I kept tring to make this shit happen'but no luck.

,PerfectSin,2007-07-01T01:47Z,"Hey guys, I forged a guide for installing Halo 2 on XP and used various comments on the web to try and create a troubleshooting section.

Visit the guide: http://ps3forums.com/showthread.php?t=81123

And tell me what you all think."
,TheBabeLover,2007-07-01T11:47Z,"Why do you need all that shit? It's so much more advanced. Use my help file, it's easy as DELL!"
,PerfectSin,2007-07-01T18:52Z,"Because some people need someone to hold their hand through the whole process. If you write down every little detail and can answer questions, troubleshooting, whatever, then there's less likely a chance that they will screw up. Thus being able to play Halo 2 quicker and easier.

I'm not insulting your release at all, it actually looks really good, just saying, my guide is out there, if anyone needs it...no matter how complex it may look."
,TheBabeLover,2007-07-01T20:12Z,You got a point there. Sorry.
,sLaY3D,2007-07-02T07:29Z,"Attention to anyone looking at this torrent:



THIS WORKS!

HALO 2 works on XP!

No viruses, or anything. TheBabeLover has uploaded a perfectly working pack.

However, I recommend people who are new to this follow PerfectSin's guide (http://ps3forums.com/showthread.php?t=81123) and also go to http://halo2xp.tk/ for help.

If you are doubting this, don't! I believe this was the first uploaded, and it works!

Go with this one, Razors has the level problem with the Gravemind. "
,TheBabeLover,2007-07-03T00:31Z,"If you want me to upload something, just tell me:)"
,slahser,2007-07-03T16:38Z,"cant install vcredist.msi, it just shuts down."
,PerfectSin,2007-07-03T20:15Z,"TBL, I don't suppose there's a way to edit the Halo 2 game code, or the Gravemind map itself, so that Halo 2 doesn't check for the disk?"
,TheBabeLover,2007-07-04T01:22Z,Can't you just extract the map? It's easy.
,PerfectSin,2007-07-04T06:28Z,"I tell people to do so, however, some people to that and still receive the Disk Check error.

People who actually buy Halo 2 for Vista, play on Vista, complain that they have that problem when playing Gravemind as well.

So it seems to be something wrong with the game itself..."
,TheBabeLover,2007-07-04T14:44Z,"Are you sure they did it right, because it worked on ""almost"" everyone that extracted the maps."
,PerfectSin,2007-07-04T22:29Z,"Dunno, they say the game works right up until the Gravemind level before they get the Disk Check error. I gave them pretty specific directions regarding UnGZIP and extracting/replacing the maps and they say it still doesn't fix it.

But if a lot of people you know say replacing the map works, then they must be doing something wrong...hmm, thanks."
,TheBabeLover,2007-07-06T13:53Z,"I don't know, haven't tried yet."
,PerfectSin,2007-07-06T23:51Z,"No, LAN requires a valid product key. Even if you have one, you may need a Silver or Gold Xbox Live account.

If that's the case, you will not be able to play LAN or Multiplayer on XP because the game requires a patch that installs on Vista only."
,TheBabeLover,2007-07-14T15:56Z,"Fr3ak0ut are you stupid? The game directory is where you installed the game, so yeah, in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Halo 2 if that's where you installed it."

,markxing,2008-01-14T01:27Z,"RENAMING FILES WILL NOT, I REPEAT, WILL NOT WORK for the Gravemind level.  The problem occurs because there is a memory allocation cap for Windows XP.  In Gravemind, the biggest level, Windows XP has to break the files apart to 64MB (what WinXP supports) , so Halo 2 reads that fragment as a corrupted map file, thus asking for the original disk.  There is a program for WinXP to support bigger filereads, but i forgot what it was.  I think it was WowMon.dll or something of the sort.  Happy hunting!"

When that level is loading, the screen changes to all-black and the hard disk heads park. No further activity occurs. The system (Windows Vista Home Premium) then freezes and must be manually powered off.

Once, and only once, was I able to get the level intro video to play (where the Arbiter gets his armor). After the video finishes, the same black screen and freezing described above occurs.

Further attempts to load the level have resulted in only the black screen -- the video has not played since it showed that one time.

like i said its just a bit tricky at the start to find the right menue which is not the LIVE login menue.
maybe someone else can clarify specific for u if u ask nicely which exact buttons to press cause my friend got lucky trying. "

as i see it probably the choices are:
1- either deleting manually(drawback u might still retain some registry info from the software installed)
2- or use the uninstaller (drawback might b if ur not carefull u may screw up ur os)
3- leave it installed for ever till u throw away ur pc (lol)

,JAR_1,2009-05-11T13:10Z,"TheBabeLover,

First of all, you're a great uploader and a great asset to the TPB community.

Obviously you've made a good work since many people got Halo 2 running successfully on XP. But many other people didn't, and I am one of them.

I followed your instructions to the letter. I installed successfully, later installed the redist.msi files and copy the .dll's (it was not clear which mf.dll should copy in the game directory since the one from the WowLoader-0.2 dir is different from the one in TheBabeLover directory, but I tried both anyway)

I couldn't figure out which one was the ""game shortcut"" So I created one shortcut with exactly the same properties ('Target' & 'Start in') as the one you showed in the ""After Install"" picture, and when click on it, a small DOS windows flickers and the nice first ""Halo 2"" blue letters over black screen starts (w/ sound) and...

Nothing more. Black disappears, I am back to Desktop and just plain frustration. Many people leave comments having the same problem and I am running XP sp3 w/ all drivers up to date, AMD 2.01GHz, 1.93GB.

After all my research and video tutorials everywhere, and the links posted here along 8 pages of comments, I 've got nowhere (most of those links are dead).

Again; You sure deserve all credit for ur hard work and I really thank you in advance for any help, but can you give some input on this? I am sure I am almost there, since I got this far. "

2. Tell them that you bought the game and have a CD-Key... but when you use it, it tells you that someone is already using it.

3. Wait for the stupidity of Bill Gates when he generates you a new CD-Key.

4. Use the CD-Key on the game and enjoy the wonderfull-ness that is Multiplayer!!!!"

For everyone else trying to make this work on XP. When this torrent downloads, the files need to be extracted THEN mounted as an .iso. Stick your .iso in your drive and look for the wowloader.rar file and extract the loader.exe. Go to your C: drive and make a new directory containing the loader.exe and name it wata, as to avoid confusion. Open DOS and follow the instructions as listed on the description. 

I'm still installing... I'll get back to ya'll with an update. 

Babe... I'm not a noob, but shit, if your file is for help, you should name it HELP.  By the way, your help file still did not help."
