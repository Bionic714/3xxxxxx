Aerosoft loves danger, as long as it is realistic and Aspen Colorado has an airport that ranks high as one of the most dangerous airports in the USA. Get ready for the Aspen-Pitkin County / Sardy Field! 

With one on runway direction usable because of high terrain North, East AND South of the airport, an back course localizer specially for the missed approach and located at nearly 8000 feet you just know you have to study your aircraft performance charts and the approach and departure documents (included of course). Of course the weather this high in the Colorado mountains will also play havoc with your flight schedules. Please note that the airport is NOT used at night hours because of the dangerous surrounding. 

The extended manual (also available as a free download from this page) will teach you a lot about the dangers of high altitude and high density altitude operations while you enjoy the Colorado mountain scenery. 

Features:

Highly detailed scenery of the airport and its surroundings
High detail mesh
Full photographic coverage of the airport and surroundings
Extensive Autogen used to build the town
Full navigation beacons (do try that missed approach using the back course localizer!)
Complete winter textures included
Extensive manual and charts
