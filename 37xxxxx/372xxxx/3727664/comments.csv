,mitch420,2009-05-10T20:17Z,"If this game (or any other burnt game) freezes @ the loading screen, (I know cod3 and fable do) you need to clear your cache.  Navigate to E:\Cache on your xbox and delete everything in there (not the folder of course) I don't even know how much media I went through thinking that was the prob. Deleted cache and everything started working!"
