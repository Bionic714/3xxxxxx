,mroblivious1bmf,2007-07-03T20:04Z,"i'm sure this is all crap.

ALSO that link does not describe at all what files are in the archive. 

people are asking for certain 'underground' bbs softwares that are pretty easy to find and someone refers them to efnet.


if anything, it's probably just a bunch of files that people already have.

i ask for a detailed list of all files.
