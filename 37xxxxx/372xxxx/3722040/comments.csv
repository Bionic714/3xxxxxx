,Boonaki,2007-06-23T18:51Z,"I was wondering why my torrents were only downloading
at 30-40k a sec when they had 2000+ seeds, after a few
hours of research and playing with peer guardian 2, I
found 100's of connections per seconds comming from
two sources. media defender and some other (forget).

I added this to my firewall ACL.

Deny All Protocol ANY 216.73.85.0-216.73.88.255 ANY Any
Deny All Protocol ANY 209.62.175.0-209.62.177.255 ANY Any
Deny All Protocol ANY 38.99.252.0-38.99.253.255 ANY Any
Deny All Protocol ANY 64.93.88.0-64.93.93.255 ANY Any
Deny All Protocol ANY 38.102.233.0-38.102.233.255 ANY Any
Deny All Protocol ANY 64.93.0.0-64.93.255.255 ANY Any

Boom, 400k a sec downloads once again.

As soon as I started peer guardian I noticed the
download speed going up, but it topped out when I
added those to the ACL. 

Beware mediadefender.com"
