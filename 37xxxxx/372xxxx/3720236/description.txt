Show Info.........: Boy Meets Boy

Plot: This 2004 reality show starred human resources benefits manager James Getzlaff. 
James, an attractive gay man, was presented with 15 potential "mates," from whom he
was supposed to find a love connection, with the help of his best friend, Andra Stasko. 
Unbeknownst to him (and not revealed to him until episode 5), some of the suitors were
straight. If he picked a gay "mate," James would win $25,000, and he and his "mate" 
would win a trip to New Zealand. If he picked a straight "mate," he would win nothing, 
and the straight guy would get the $25,000.
