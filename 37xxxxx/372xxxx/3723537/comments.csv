,Squikers81,2007-07-25T17:57Z,Can this be burned down to a dvd?
,jthunders75,2007-08-02T07:01Z,"Thanks a lot, Pulseczar.  You used a fucked codec like fmp4, like the ex-cop amateur you are.  All I wanted to do was to come home, get drunk, smoke some hash, and watch the Trailer Boys, but no...you gotta fuck it up with your bullshit.
Fuck you, Leahy
Fuck you, Randy
And especially fuck you, Pulseczar!"
,secretagentlady,2007-08-30T22:14Z,lol!!!
,grizling,2007-10-05T00:59Z,"This good weed is easy to burn to dvd - for instance  with DvdFab Platinum.
Thanx a lot Pulse - this is muthafuckin' awesome shit. The more you see, the higher you get......"
,McGlobulon,2007-11-06T06:53Z,how the fuck do you get this to work
,nunofyurbiz,2007-11-22T04:58Z,"I'm with jthunders75.
How the F%#K do I play this? I live in the states and can't watch it any other way.

Any help out there? 
Divx - no, WMPlayer - no, WinAmp - no
what works?????"
,Pulseczar,2007-11-30T23:01Z,Use VLC or Media player classic to play 'em. Also make sure you got the K-Lite codec pack installed. Just google it if you don't.

,krakt,2009-07-04T18:39Z,"tgo0 is absolutely right.  If you don't like it, f*ck off.  It plays just fine on my Xbox"
,hobotr0n,2009-07-11T17:53Z,thanks broe
,coldz,2009-10-20T04:07Z,"To jthunders75, Shut your fucking mouth...download VLC media player and get over it...They are great quality if you just use a REAL media player...douchebag"
,Saabatron,2009-11-21T02:53Z,well said coldz :P
,Saabatron,2009-11-24T13:43Z,"well... i just seen some of the episodes and realized that the quality is pretty bad for the size of each episode being around 500 - 600 MBs each for a play time of just over 20 minutes...  so i used AutoGK (google how to use it) and brought each of the files down to around 300 Mbs with no loss of quality from what i seen. but still, it's season 7 :P"
,herb0i0,2010-09-01T21:05Z,Does this have the special Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys on it?
,hughdillon,2011-02-17T06:32Z,thanx man. this is the shit
