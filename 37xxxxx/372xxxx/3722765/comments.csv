its a shit load faster. and you dont have to torrent it. I did that work for you guys. your welcome."
,fungusboy,2009-02-14T02:38Z,"^^^^^^^^you may notice on the link that the file is a bit smaller than this torrent, its because i converted the ISO to a UIF. it works the same way as an ISO, but its better compressed is all. and its in a .rar as well. just mount the UIF like a ISO and your ready to go.
