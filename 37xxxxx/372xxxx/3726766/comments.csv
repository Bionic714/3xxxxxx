Anyways, the image and sound is very nice, very watchable :)"

,gasman364,2007-06-29T08:06Z,"Uh, don't bother downloading this one.  There's no sound.  K-lite, VLC, Classic Media Player, full codec installed . . .nothing.

This is why it's only been downloaded 20 times. Can't believe I'm the first one to identify this as a total piece of shit."

Also quality is really good for such an early release, the contrast is bad and it's somewhat blurred, but it's barely noticeable. It's not worth waiting for better release if you want to watch it now."
