Alice in Chains is a popular and influential rock band that formed in Seattle, Washington in 1987. They were one of the most commercially successful bands from the Seattle grunge music scene, selling over 15 million albums worldwide. Unlike many of their peers, Alice in Chains owed more to heavy metal than to punk rock or classic rock, but the group became closely associated with grunge due to their Seattle roots, their image, and their introspective and sometimes morbid lyrics.
