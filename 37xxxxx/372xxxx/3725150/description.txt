Cybervenus FeiFei - Virtually Real - Escapi

This was made in Japan at the early 2k, when computer technology was about to explode to every household worldwide. This DVD is a showcase of what computer gfx was about at those days. It turned out to be so popular that it started a phenomenon of "virtual megastars". This one is the 3rd release from Escapi.
