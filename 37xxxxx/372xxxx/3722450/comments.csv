,xucphra,2007-07-01T23:56Z,"July First - I am taking a break from seeding....don't lose faith!!! I am seeding off my iPod because my computer is out of space, and i need my iPod, but I will be back in a couple hours...about 7:30 (New York Time)"
,cnab,2007-07-02T15:39Z,thanks so mutch for this do the dl is a bit slow :)
,xucphra,2007-07-04T12:25Z,"yeah...no seeding on the fourth of july...sorry for the slow dl, but i have been going through remodeling, so i have been getting rid of a bunch of  stuff...and so i have been seeding a bit inconsistantly....i specifically tried to not put it in a zip or rar so that you could prioritize them and get them faster....one at a time...anyways....enjoy them...although it might take a while for you guys to get it...some people are already at 50% though"
,mountndo,2007-07-14T10:40Z,"xucphra, could you seed more often so we can hit 100%? Im sure there are enough peers here to continue to seed it once we've hit a 100%.  Then it should fly without you needing to seed.  Thnx cant wait to see the whole thing. "
,makingcookies,2007-07-14T13:58Z,"how long is ""a break""? i would like to have this done before the summer's out.."
,makingcookies,2007-07-14T16:22Z,this is only going to take 389 days and 22 hours...

,xucphra,2007-07-16T18:20Z,"whoa! hold on...when i say ONE break..i mean about three hours....i am seeding 24/7...seriously...if it's going slow, thats not my fault, because i have been seeding CONSTANTLY!!
yea its seeding off my iPod, and my connection isnt very fast. anyhow, everyone is in the 90's so dont worry...just help me seed when you finish"
,xucphra,2007-07-16T18:33Z,"by the way, next torrent is the All Excess DVD of A7X and all the Simpsons and Futurama episodes, though that should take a bit longer, because there have been many more of  those. btw, my AIM is xucphra7"
,Mod1Fy,2007-07-21T03:06Z,"Any word on that ""All Excess"" Torrent???"
,xucphra,2007-07-21T03:25Z,yep its gonna be up in a couple hours...it took me forever to find the actual DVD though...because i live in the middle of nowhere.
,xucphra,2007-07-21T04:22Z,maybe a bit later...this is taking a while to rip...for info...goto my AIM

,xucphra,2007-10-27T21:19Z,"well if you are having trouble watching it, I would suggest using VLC Media Player which u can get at http://www.videolan.org/vlc/

About the speed, sorry, nothing I can do right this second, because my primary hard-drive crashed, and I'm waiting for it to be repaired. When it is, I'll be back to seeding"
,xucphra,2007-10-27T21:20Z,"Speaking of which, my next torrent is the Avenged Sevenfold self titled album along with the MVI that contains 3 hours of unseen Avenged Sevenfold footage. Just letting you know. =]"
,heartbraden,2007-11-06T04:16Z,This isn't organized very well at all... And some are tagged wrong.  Thanks for putting it up there... but next time make sure it's a quality release.
,SMBB,2007-11-18T23:02Z,"Hi, xucphra.

I am downloading this torrent- using 'Utorrent', however it has got to 61.8% and has halted.

It is reporting as inactive, and the DHT status is 'inactive.'

The availability is red and blue.

I have tried to test by dowloading one of your other files, and they download fine. What is the issue, have you deleted family guy or something?

Thanks
"
,xucphra,2007-11-19T17:03Z,"it seems nobody is seeding, ill keep on seeding in a few days, so that you get it in no time."

,xucphra,2008-07-02T18:00Z,@SMBB; just wait for the second release. It'll be out once I get back from vacations which is in a couple weeks.
