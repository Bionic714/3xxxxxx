,Scorpion-King,2007-06-25T16:39Z,in with order shall I install them??
,emtt,2007-06-25T18:14Z,"The installer program should install each of the selected games sequentially, so you might just check all of the 'games' (core and expansion/stuff packs, though they're selected by default) and install to some directory.
Depending on how many of them you select for installation at once, it should take a while as it extracts all the files to the selected directory. There is no progress indication however.

The only requirement, that I know of, is that you have to have the core game installed to play anything else."
,Zumbar,2007-06-28T23:11Z,"Thank you, will check it out and tell if its working!"
,steff_ice,2007-06-29T04:57Z,Multi languages?
,Zumbar,2007-06-29T13:14Z,"OK, I've runned the installer and I wonder how to start the game?!
What expansion should I start and what cd should I mount?`
It always says there is no cd..."
,Zumbar,2007-06-29T13:21Z,When I run for example NightLife I get the error that sims 2 has to be intalled first!
,emtt,2007-06-29T21:24Z,"It seems an anti-blacklist program (e.g. YASU) is needed for the exes to recognise the CD image. I tested this torrent's files on just one winxp machine I had access to. It worked for what I tested, but the installer probably doesn't take into account enough things to work properly in some situations. I cannot spare any more time to this however, so I won't be improving the installer or finding out why the game doesn't work. I hope someone else will though.

One thing I noticed a moment ago though, is that the installer's file dialog gives only relative paths for the registry entries, which might cause The Sims 2 to not run properly. Typing the full path (e.g. ""C:\The Sims 2 base dir"" to the edit box might help)."
,MariaKE,2007-07-03T15:23Z,I hope any one of you +170 who are dl this now works out how/what to mount and tells me about it. Geez....

,madmouse1,2007-07-11T17:27Z,when i try to launch the sims 2 it alwyas says there is no cd. why???
,peterge,2007-07-15T02:14Z,"Mount the disk for your latest expansion or stuff pack with DAEMON Tools V3.47 as only this version is not blacklisted.

,smiffo99,2007-08-11T11:54Z,"why are you people so damn thick? to get any game to work without cd you have to replace the original exe file with a cracked one! then also  create a short cut on ur desktop with ur new exe. if u have no idea what u are doing, then why try it in the first place!  most of u guys kno how to turn ur pcs on, thats all!"

A window opens, I?m stuck. Please help me. Treat me like a moron and step by step instructions would be appreciated!!!"
,IceSycle14,2008-01-22T00:33Z,I'm pretty sure you need the actual Sims 2 (from what it sounds like) to play these expansions and i don't think it's included.
