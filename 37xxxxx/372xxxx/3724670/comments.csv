,k0nsl,2007-06-26T21:34Z,"In short and simple terms; it transforms the target computer into a socks5 server which can be used by you or whoever you decide should use it - just enter the IP number and port in a application which supports the socks5 protocol and voilรก you've got yourself a working socks5 server shielding your ip adress. Good for, example, IRC and MSN and a host of other applications."
