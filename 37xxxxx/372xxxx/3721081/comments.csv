,joannellis,2007-07-03T04:52Z,"Definitely a fantastic album, bangin' good prog.  
Do you have a favorite track?  

I guess here's my opinion on the 3 originals:

1. Close to the Edge: intricate, kick-ass, challenging, evocative
2. And You & I: soaring, emotional, sweeping, moving, yearning, satisfying

3. Siberian Khatru: kick-ass cool...but historically-speaking I'd never consider it as much of a fav as the other two...
