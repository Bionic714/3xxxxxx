1) First, they take notice, and they remember it. Whatever they know about the issue, and even if they hope I DO get thrown in jail, they remember that someone is openly DARING the feds to prosecute him.

2) They quickly see that this isn't someone just hiding, and trying to get away with not paying what he owes. They see there is much more to it, and that the purpose is to battle an alleged fraud, not just to get one person out of not paying his ""fair share.""

3) They see that it's not a complaint about the law. While they only get a brief little taste of the actual issue, it's enough to show them that it's not just someone whining that his taxes are too high. Again, whether they BELIEVE it or not doesn't even matter when they first see it.

4) They see where they can go to see for themselves what it's all about, rather than just believing some lazy ""reporter"" whose in-depth research consists of quoting some bureaucrat saying ""its frivolous.""

5) They see that, at least for now, someone openly resisting the IRS is not in jail. Whether they expect or even want me to be prosecuted, it gets their attention that someone would do such a thing, and that he hasn't yet been prosecuted for doing it. (Remember, that is one of the essential ingredients to the preservation of the extortion racket: the public believing that ""resistance is futile,"" and anyone who doesn't pay ends up in the slammer.)

6) The message of Operation ""Glove in Face,"" and the message of the ""Theft By Deception"" video, when it finally sinks in for John Doe, has a very different result from anything else I've seen. While all the theories and arguments look (to the public) like someone trying to get out of paying ""his taxes,"" the message should be that YOU (John Doe) have been DEFRAUDED. It's not that there's some loophole, or some way to get out of paying ""your taxes."" It's that you were intentionally deceived by lawyers and politicians who wanted your money. It's nothing more than an illegal swindle... just a really BIG one. When people finally see for themselves that they have been robbed, they get angry, and they get on board the cause. I've seen it over and over again.

For the zillionth time, this fraud WILL fall. If you want to make it happen faster, I invite anyone to distribute this far and wide, as a flier, as a newspaper ad, etc.

I have seen it over and over again. It is what WORKS. It is what will get the attention, and then the support, of the general public. Don't just have good intentions; have good RESULTS. Let's take down this monster before it chews up any more innocent victims.

Sincerely,

Larken Rose
