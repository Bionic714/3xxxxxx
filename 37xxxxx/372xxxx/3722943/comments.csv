Linux is open source."
,earthdragon921,2008-12-20T07:10Z,I don't see the point of putting pics in a rar or anyother kind of archive. If the pics are JPEG compressed then it is almost impossible to compress them even another kilobyte with most standard compression algorithms (including rar and lzma). BItTorrent handles multiple files just fine.
