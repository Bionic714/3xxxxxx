,RobinHenricsson,2007-07-02T18:55Z,"I usually don't watch CZW, but I might give it a try now. Thanks for the recommendation!"
,UCW_RaZoR,2007-07-13T22:47Z,fuck you..CZW sucks...if u know anything about wrestling u should not look at that crap
,RobinHenricsson,2007-07-20T22:04Z,"Easy with the attitude there mate. CZW probably isn't for me either, though. I'm not into the hardcore stuff."
,deadpool1205,2007-12-21T08:04Z,"Hey Robin, Would you happen to have any of the ROH matches of CM Punk, Samoa Joe, and Colt Cabana?

I would love to see these, as I've only seen highlight videos, but I've heard they had some amazing matches.

Just wondering if you had any and if so, if you could maybe upload them sometime"
,RobinHenricsson,2007-12-26T22:36Z,"Yeah, sure thing. I'll upload some stuff right away! Just let me know if you want some more stuff. :)"

,Raep-FIN,2008-08-04T13:59Z,"Whoa, almost missed this one, the matchlist seems to be pretty interesting. Big cheers, dude."
