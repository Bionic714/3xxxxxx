I decided to convince my friends how totally awesome professional wrestling is, so I put together some of my favourite matches to show them. Most of them are from Ring of Honor, but there are matches from WWE, TNA, WCW etc. in there as well.

For all the haters out there, take a look at this and you might change your minds.

There are a total of 13 matches included.
