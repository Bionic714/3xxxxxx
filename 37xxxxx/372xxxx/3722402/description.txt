Thomas Toivonen's Dead Society cuts straight 
to the heart of the situation we?re in right 
now. The conclusion? We're fucked! The mass 
technological culture is killing the planet 
and if we are to survive, we have to take a 
look at the roots of the problem. But also 
avoid false solutions like alternative or 
?green? technology. 

The movie centers around an interview 
with John Zerzan, anarcho-primitivist 
philosopher and author who give his 
view on the problem with civilization 
and what can be done about it. 
According to him it?s the reality and 
not ideas that will give way for a 
paradigm shift. That is, if people are 
provided with an alternative...  

In total the film in its 55 minutes 
is a very welcomed addition to the not 
so large collection of green anarchist films. 
I think as many people as possible should see 
it, especially those who are hypnotized by 
living in the mad machinery of civilization. 
It's a slap in the face, an eye opener, a shock; 
but also inspiring.

Favorite scenes: riots, making fire with bow-drill, 
animals jumping...
