,jizac2,2007-06-29T07:10Z,"Hi, I've a comment

I didn't read anywhere where it says ""boot install only""

but I cannot run setup from the desktop.
(like after it is done burning and the autorun starts after opening and closing the cd tray door)

Used nero to burn @8x

Seems to be an autorun error here is the exact error :

""the file autorun.dll could not be loaded or is corrupt Setup cannot continue error code is (0x7E)""

Anyone else who has downloaded SpeedyVista CD Version 1 XPeriencing this behavior?

on a side note downloaded, burned, & ran the setup without a hitch >>>""Windows Vista Ultimate Ultra Lite 32 Bit"""
,superleeds28,2007-06-29T09:10Z,"Yer, you carnt upgrade from previous versions.

Boot from cd only job"
,rgunter,2007-06-29T13:03Z,"Super....what do I do after I have burned the image and booted with the cd....it takes me to DOS and from there, I don't know what to do.  It just tells me at the prompt that the program cannot from DOS mode.  Have I done something wrong?  Thanks...Ron"
,superleeds28,2007-06-29T13:32Z,"Yeh you have.
