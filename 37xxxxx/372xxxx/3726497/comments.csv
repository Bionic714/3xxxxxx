,oggeman_jr,2007-07-11T14:27Z,"hey  guys, for u who tries to play on the computer,illegally!... use no$gba, it works as a ds emulator as well"
,karl johan,2007-07-11T14:41Z,Tack för förklaringen!Men när jag nu spelar och stänger spelet måste jag starta om från början.Någon som kan hjälpa en nybörjare med detta
,punto,2007-07-23T03:37Z,"this is useless, you removed the rom number from the filenames. now you won't know which ones you already have when the next pack is released, and if you burn them to a bunch of DVDs you won't be able to know which one has which game. good job"

,rodan_424,2007-08-26T20:14Z,If somemore seed a bit all could get it home faster...
,WormSlayer,2007-09-10T03:21Z,"rodan_424: Maybe the Harry Potter game doesn't run on your particular cartridge?

Sadly not many people seed this torrent after completing it, but I'll leave it going as long as there's people downloading.

To date, I've uploaded 84.7GB of this torrent, and about 57GB of my other NDS ROM torrents - which are also still seeded :)

(Which can be found here"
,WormSlayer,2007-09-10T03:23Z,Hmm broken link... just click on my name :)
,Ran4,2007-09-19T21:21Z,"Yeah, don't download this crap... You'll miss some really good jap games."
,WormSlayer,2007-09-19T23:47Z,"The only Jap ROM anyone has ever requested is Sim City, but an English version came out shortly after anyway, which seems to be what happens.

If you would care to suggest some must-have Japanese ROMs, I would be happy to seed them."
,MrV,2007-11-03T09:13Z,"Digistar how the hell can u say that the game doesn't work cause it's a RAR-file??!

PS. Does anyone know a torrent site for ages 18+?"
,DownloaderDawg,2007-12-18T16:14Z,PLEASE SEED!!!!! CHEERS!!!
,megane836,2007-12-20T00:31Z,"Hi, just bought an R4 and many of the games you have my 7yr old son really wants for xmas, can you tell an ageing parent in idiot form, how to download these to a newly puchased R4. I would really appreciate your help. Many thanks."
,Royvedas,2008-01-12T23:57Z,Good thing to get that jap shit outta here. Who understands jap anyway (besides japs). All good jap games (Mario and stuff) are translated - everyone should be satisfied.
,nasTdude,2008-01-17T01:26Z,"Damn it why does it say there is like 137 seeders, but i am only connected to a few and i am only downloading at a 0.2kb\s  what the COME oN Guys SEED!!!!

,seanv,2008-01-19T23:35Z,winrar says the rar for Kakuromaniacs is corrupted.  The other games I've downloaded work fine though.

,ben6ft1,2008-03-25T16:30Z,Good thing to get that jap shit outta here. Who understands jap anyway (besides japs). All good jap games (Mario and stuff) are translated - everyone should be satisfied. Well said!!!
,masterKurdi,2008-04-30T11:28Z,"DANM!!! None and i mean NONE of those games work!!!!! For Example the game Pheonix wright is playable BUT u cant save...as soon as u save it says ""save failed"" and some games are just as Rodan_424 said. when u start the game it says ""the data could not be written turn power off and remove and reinsert the DS card"". I use No$Gba and when u press F3 u can see a errir stats on the game...and in one place it says ""Multiboot Support -- Unsupported (file too large)""...any idea?"
,mikezombie,2008-06-29T10:05Z,all of these games work on the DS. all the emulators available are terrible try some different ones which may work for different games.
,philsella,2008-07-07T01:32Z,Took me 30 hours to download this and all i got was 12 games out of it...i tried to unpack the euro files with winrar and it gave me errors on all but 12 games..Can you help please? are the files broken?
,cxwxb777,2008-07-07T12:58Z,philsella 
,cxwxb777,2008-07-07T13:14Z,philsella Just tell Winrar to repair the rar file it should fix it
,WormSlayer,2008-08-21T05:13Z,It's possible your using an old version of winrar? The rar format changed in the not too distant past and older versions of WinRAR cant open newer .rar files.
,g8crapachino,2008-12-04T07:03Z,I downloaded and tested several games. All games tested so far work with my R4 and M3 Real cards.  If you are stupid enough to download this without even knowing how to load and play the games (or even how to unpack a RAR) then that's your own damn fault.
,jackson5more,2009-03-25T10:31Z,some nds files are coming up as corrupted archives - tried deleting/redownloading them; repairing archive; updated Winrar to latest and repeating - no fix. eg. Avatar - otherwise most seem ok - thanks
