,Morit,2007-10-12T22:47Z,Im my opinion if a program is sharewere then it would be nice to have crack that makes it into full version... And it is.

,Gerry_A,2008-05-03T06:57Z,Haven't checked it but AVG is really bad for giving false positives. I've stopped using it for checking these kind of downloads and usually turn it off when I'm using any keygens.
,Gerry_A,2008-05-03T07:01Z,Also Version 8 on this web site (maybe all)doesn't use serial numbers or need cracks. Version 9 needs a serial number.
