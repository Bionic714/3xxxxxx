        AKA :: Bruce Campbell vs The Army Of Darkness

This is the official mgm Japanese Release that was extended from 86 mins to 93 mins. This is not a bootleg job made from some
poor vhs copy. This is a good quality conversion by the studio using the original footage. It also features the origina "cave" ending
favoured by director Sam Raimi and actor Bruce Campbell.

Sympnosis :: Bound in human flesh, inked in blood and amazingly hard to pronounce, the ancient Necronomicon, or Book of the
 Dead, unleashes unspeakable evil upon mankind in director Sam Raimi's outrageously historical sword and sorcery epic. Back to
 do battle with the hideous Deadites, Bruce Campbell reprises his role from The Evil Dead series as Ash, the handsome 
shotgun-toting, chainsaw-armed department store clerk from S-Mart's housewares division. Demonic forces time-warp him - and
 his '73 Oldsmobile - back to England's Dark Ages, where he romances a beauty (Embeth Davidtz) and faces legions of undead
 beasts, including a ghastly army of skeletons. Can Ash save the living from the evil dead, rescue his girlfriend and get back to his 
own time? Overflowing with spectacular special effects, Army of Darkness will make you scream with fear and laughter?
