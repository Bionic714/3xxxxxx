Great music!
TY"
,themonkthatiscool,2008-01-04T18:50Z,"Contrary to my previous post (after listening to the song properly) - The songs seem to be poor recordings compared to a few I have from a CD. Not only is the quality worse (tinny?) but it seems they are different versions (different lengths and they all sing at different points and stuff...)

I am going to check out the albums from other torrents..."
,suburbann,2008-01-18T03:04Z,"ummm, a lot of these songs; 1. sound tinny, 2. vocals are off, 3. song lengths dont match CD's

is this live or a coverband or something?"
,suburbann,2008-01-19T17:29Z,"actually it's just valley of the damned which sounds like crap, the other 2 are nice"
,jasonbir,2008-01-21T07:35Z,"OMG wow i heard through the fire and flames for the first time, and i am hooked. amazing music, actually I'm into hip hop and rap, but this ""power metal"" is un fucking believable. Especially when you're baked."

,master of jackson kelly,2008-01-30T13:32Z,"The name of the songs aren't the same as the real name of the songs! (fields of despair, soldier of the wasteland, cry of the brave, once in a lifetime,etc..) you need to check it before you upload it on the pirate bay"
