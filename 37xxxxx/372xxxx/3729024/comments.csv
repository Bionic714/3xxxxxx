Its almost certainly a false positive alert from overly protective heuristics, in other words...

IAM NOT UPLOADING TROJANS all day long...

this is a compressed exe your virus tools doesnt know about, and be sure its no Trojan, iam the programmer of this, and i should (and do) know that!... believe or not, just thought to let ya know!... read more about in your virustool manual (overly protective heuristics)

thanks for reading!....

Forgive me if you have run into this request a few times - just spreading out the alert.  30 folks are stuck at 28.4%.  It's been about 5 weeks, maybe more and patiently we are all hoping for a hero to jump in and save the day.  Anyone and Everyone that hears and helps - Thanks 10,000 times.  PB Seeders are AWEsome.  BEV was requested and less than 1 Day (!) later PB came forward and seeded.  Thnx!"

Wazzzabi, Dawg?? :)

Hey - As is typical w/ ur offerings, this one works great - (well, 'cept that I can't seem to  toggle 'ON' that 'Petit  Mode' tingy).  No big, tho - still cool since everything else seems to be working fine in it.

But, bro...  PLEASE!!!! Can you try to get the full F/V of this R/C sim called 'ClearView'???  Uh, MAN - it's the SHIZZ!!

Thanks In Advance! :)
NeT..

,sentientphil,2010-03-28T00:20Z,"Fantastic! very fast download! i have no sound whatsoever within the game, but doesnt matter... 

i would have seeded indefinitely, but as soon as i extracted the files, my new torrent client (Vuze) stopped seeding! i havent a clue how to rectify this, so sincerest apologies to everyone...."

,CainUAC23,2011-07-15T02:02Z,"dude your programming is shit, locked up my system, and changed the graphix settings to minimal, youre programming is NOT compatible with Win7 64bit, the game was fun (kinda) but the uber lag and virus from your programing crap was not acceptable, idk how you managed to get a green skull with this crap."
,CainUAC23,2011-07-15T02:04Z,maybe you should have left it alone and fixed the uninstaller so that people of new Windows versions can uninstall through the file and not by deleting the folder and then having to clean the registry.
