Synopsis: As a boy, orphan and dropout Rick Martin finds his only outlet in music. Through chance-met black jazzman Art Hazzard, he develops into a great trumpeter...too great for jazz-hating Jack Chandler, leader of the dance band he joins. But before long he's in a better big band, thanks to the interest of sweet singer Jo Jordan, who alas introduces him to her slinky, rich, highly neurotic friend Amy North. Amy's inconsistent ways soon make Rick a virtual basket case. Is he washed up, or will he find that elusive high note his trumpet won't play? Allegedly based on the life of jazz great Bix Beiderbecke.
