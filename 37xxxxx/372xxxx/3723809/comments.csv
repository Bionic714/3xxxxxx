A big thanks! :-)"
,Aga1980,2007-06-26T11:21Z,Thanks for this classic!
,Evil Jesus,2007-12-02T23:08Z,"Warning: This title has only one seeder and the video only downloads to 99.9%. The one seeder is only on sporadically and not for long enough to bring anyone to 100%. I have left it running for a solid week and the last .1% is impossible to get. Will the seeder please stay on at least long enough to allow some people to get to 100 and become full seeders themselves? Also, as soon as I get the full movie I can convert to DivX and seed that too."

,mpoit957,2008-02-29T04:09Z,"Hi, can you seed for a few more days please, I'm stuck at 95%.

I will keep it open for two weeks after DL.

Thanks!"
,muzikphan,2008-03-06T06:20Z,"Please let us finish this.
I'm stuck at 95.77% too for a few weeks already.
Please, please, please seed it.
Peace."
,muzikphan,2008-03-14T14:03Z,"Thanks a lot.
I've finally finished it.
What a great movie for us Jazz lovers!
Will be seeding to a ratio of 2.0 in gratitude and to keep this one alive for some more time. 
I hope someone else will keep it after that.
Great up!"

Thanks."
