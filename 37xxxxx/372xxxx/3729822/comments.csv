,xushi,2008-09-12T21:08Z,"This software isn't the best out there...

It doesn't support converting from mkv

When you drag and drop more than one video, it doesnt queue them in order

You can't move videos up or down the queue to arrange them

You can't add or delete individual videos from the queue once it starts encoding. you must stop it first

CPU/Process management is horrible. When it's running, the whole system is sluggish and slow

It's as if it's poorly designed and developed...

You can;t tell when a new version comes out, because their website doesnt tell you anywhere, and when asking them for support, they have some of the dumbest most useless support i've ever seen.. It's been 1.5 years now i'm sending the same question and i only get a ""sorry, we dont know"" reply from them.

the videos i encode as ipod profile ALWAYS get out of sync around halfway through the episode... tried it on 2 different ipods with the same problem.

the list goes on and on....

As an alternative, i recommend iSquint."
,Josh84G,2009-02-11T21:37Z,Serial worked great. No one to seed to but i will keep it goin for sure.
,meTalgirth,2009-04-05T09:47Z,"This is the same d!ckless xilisoft video conversion software plastered all over TPB and it sux. I have a pretty simple conversion problem- mp4 video with the dimensions 851x420 to mp4 video 320x240 and it can't even do that.  The only software for mac that's worked for me is the ""TOP Video converter"".  And by the way this package is not the same as the package pictured @ the provided url"
,danionow,2010-06-14T03:29Z,"Any way you could upload or send FSDreamteam KJFK scenery? I had it before, worked perfectly but I've lost it and ones i download dont work :'(       Thanks"
,ravinderS,2011-02-05T07:21Z,"Although the crack didn't work for me either but the serial did, i entered the serial with little snitch running in the dock.

Thanks linemasterjorbob for the serial and komunitta for the upload."
