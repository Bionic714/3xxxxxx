Yes I know there is an audio sync problem.  I just figured it
out that it's a problem with the transcoder programme I'm
using.  I'll switch to mencoder for my next cap instead.  This
is still very much a work-in-progress and it will
take me a few tries to get everything right.  Please have patience with me as I learn the nuances of HDTV Firewire capping.
