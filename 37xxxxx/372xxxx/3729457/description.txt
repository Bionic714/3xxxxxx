Release-Notes:
==============


Many professionals are familiar with the problem; quality loss caused by digital image
magnification. In many cases a great deal of time is spent on achieving only a fairly
acceptable enlargement result, however there are familiar side effects including
out-of-focus images and serrated edges which is illustrative for the lack of
professional magnification software.

PhotoZoom Pro 2 is based on S-Spline XL: a renewed and improved version of our patented,
self-adjusting, many times awarded S-Spline interpolation technology. As we did with
S-Spline, our S-Spline XL technology again introduces a revolutionary breakthrough in
digital image enlargement. It is able to render sharp and crisp clear image magnifications,
perfectly focused, yet without the jagged edges, loss of detail or lack of photorealism
that normally come with enlarging images.
