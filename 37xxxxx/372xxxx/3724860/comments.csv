,pirateradiorocks,2011-04-29T04:25Z,"Okay, first off a big THANK YOU for the upload. Now, went to wikipedia and followed a lotta links in it reading reports, etc.... It is a decent movie, but is biased against the Weavers. Gotta think the only reason it got made was to try to paint the Weavers as the bad guys and the govt. as inept as they are. Gone to a lotta gun shows and it is always the govt. snitches that suggest doing something illegal. Change out a sear pin, find a sawed off shotgun, make a sale w/o ID, etc... When you hear talk like that at a gun show, you contact the County Sheriff and the next thing you know there are feds everywhere trying to cover their arses. Been to more than one where the Feds were ordered to leave by the County Sheriff after everyone was ordered to produce ID. Most of those fed snitches look like the idiot in the leather jacket-too Hollywood. Simple rule, don't make a weapon sale to somebody you wouldn't trust in your home with a loaded weapon! It's not racism, it's a survival instinct. Anyway-off the soapbox and thanks again for the upload. Randy is a great guy, he'd stop to help you change a tire in the rain when everybody else has driven by even today.
