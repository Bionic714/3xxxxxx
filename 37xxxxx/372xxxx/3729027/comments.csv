Dont do as the help file tells you, just start the NL.exe

Nice game
Thx!"
,Tilleros,2007-08-16T09:11Z,Help!!  I can't start it..
[V],Subzero!,2007-08-21T03:40Z,"@ejldk 

It's almost certainly a false positive from overly protective heuristics... what your virustool alerts about. but nevermind, the game surely doesnt work to the end by you , because allowing your virustool to delete this, makes it IMPOSSIBLE to play this to the end!, take this as kind of personal protection from toed!, for all the nonbelievers!... ITS NO TROJAN, and dont follow other install descriptions . others than then one coming with the release!"

,kekko13,2007-10-28T19:18Z,"Listen this

I can start game normally and screen shows up, its all ok but it says i need 3d hardware acceleration. When i start simulation it says 0 fps, and its all very slow...

It wont be funny if i have some trash comp but i have core 2 duo 1,86 MHz, 2 gb ram, nvidia geforce 7600 gt with 256 mb (i think it is pretty nice comp)

Also i have vista (maybe thats the problem)"
,kekko13,2007-10-29T10:02Z,Never mind. I solve da problem.
,kekko13,2007-12-18T14:54Z,It HAS GOT a trojan i now get it with the AVG. But it didn't bother the computer
,FabianWasHere,2008-06-03T20:50Z,"If it works, I may seed."
,irockubite335,2008-06-24T01:30Z,"Okay i have a question. Ive downloaded it and i have the desktop icons but when i click it, it says its just a trial version and i have to buy the full version... it says i need a user name and register key... help?"
,Fishy4Life,2009-01-18T14:49Z,"@kekko13
           Hey, I have the same exact problem and I cannot run it well, I have a decent computer that has vista and specifications way passed recommended. Now my question is...Did you solve the problem? "
,spamuel25,2009-08-06T00:54Z,What is the key code for the game
,bychance,2010-06-15T02:46Z,"Downloaded fast. Unrared and installed fine. Copied and pasted name and E-mail address from
document. Done the same with serial #. Perfect.
Thanks a lot Subzero!."
