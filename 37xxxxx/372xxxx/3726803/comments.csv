,apple][guy,2007-06-29T19:49Z,Updated 10.4.10 Nvidia kexts MAY not work on some AMD systems.
,antt,2007-06-29T20:28Z,do you guys know if there is a 10.4.10 release for sse2? 
,cbmaster,2007-06-29T22:08Z,"There is no SSE2 release yet. This update was just released and it's best to start off with SSE3.

When you install automatically, your extensions are backed up at /10410backup in your OSX partition. If you fail to load after reboot because the Nvidia kexts did not work on your discount AMD system, boot with -f (safemode) and recover the kexts."

,cvdgenugten,2007-08-12T14:55Z,"Updating now.. using easy install on my GX620 Dell computer from 10.4.9 (Jas Update) from 10.4.8.. Pressing restart now.. Please keep your fingers crossed, will post result in 10 minutes.. "
,cvdgenugten,2007-08-12T15:08Z,"ok, works.. phew.. I updated with the easy install, but now my monitor (1908FP Dell) is not recognized, so I get a 1024x768 resolution. 
Now doing a custom installation, checked the graphics kexts 10.4.10 and hoping for the best. 
Otherwise, no performance increase, xbench still clocks me at around 80.0, which is good. No less, no more, I only installed the update to run iwork 08 and ilife 08 ;-)"
,cvdgenugten,2007-08-12T15:20Z,"hmm.. resolution change didn't work, checking into other settings. just chnged the com.apple.boot.plist file to include the 1280x1024x32 entry.. that does work, but I would like to be able to change resolutions from the system preferences gui.. oh well. In any case, it all works like a charm now :D"

,sfxc13,2007-11-08T22:42Z,please reseed! There are no seeders online!
,andsteele,2008-01-24T19:12Z,"I just installed this on my osx86 (10.4.8) After I installed, it wouldn't boot up. Just had to reinstall it. Did I do something wrong?"
