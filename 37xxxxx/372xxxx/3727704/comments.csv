great game , but too less compatiblity... my opinion... atleast an congig tool would have done it, where some options could be set off ... to may play then....."

,420dopeman,2007-06-29T18:10Z,"Yep, this one is total bullshit, codemasters contracted to many different PC hardware manufacturers for lots of money. They knew it would be largely pirated, so they made up for it by producing a game only those with an EXTREMLeY high-end PC could run. The money is surely pouring in to the harware manufacturers just from those upgrading to play this game, hence, codemasters is also pouring in the spiff money.
They didnt need to make this game so high-end, at all..

greeetz sub."
,AsssKisser666,2007-07-01T22:02Z,"Actually 420dopeman, youre wrong about one thing. This game doesnt even run well on high-end machines. I have one, it runs crap on it too. So this is just poor coding from ""codemasters"". Actually it runs well on my 360 as long as I only drive rally, but not the others where you have some live competition. This game is great, but very very poor executed code wise."
,hobblesp,2007-07-12T00:54Z,"I beg to differ, this runs fine with all settings maxed, bar resolution (1280x1024) and no vsync. I only have an 8800gts and 1 gig of ram and an AMD 5000+. Not the best machine on earth, but it handled everything this game threw at it at 30fps+.


p.s. I am using a cut down version of windows xp. not vista."
,BobCFC,2007-07-21T05:46Z,"Thanks for the NO INTRO fix that got it working on 64bit for me!

Graphics are gorgeous with the detail maxed out

(1680x1050 on 8800GTS 320mb/E6600)"

,UglyPilot,2008-04-25T00:39Z,"FOR ANYONE HAVING ISSUES WITH BLACK SCREEN UPON START FOR S.T.A.L.K.E.R AND COLIN MCRAE DIRT: HERE'S MY SOLUTION:

There is a file called adi_oal.dll in directory; c:\windows\system32\adi_oal.dll

Or if you have a 64 bit system;
c:\windows\SysWOW64\adi_oal.dll

DELETE OR RENAME THIS FILE!

I had installed colin mcrae dirt for over 4 months and luckily I found this solution on codemasters forum. And I can play both stalker and colin. Before this, I couldnt play both.

And I didn't need to use no-intro fix. Hope this helps with anyone."

,Kolya-ru,2011-11-14T20:18Z," DiRT NO INTRO helped me to launch the game, but i can't adjust screen resolution - it's remain 800x600 and 4:3 after game restart."
,Kolya-ru,2011-11-15T00:48Z,"Ok, do not install reg file."
