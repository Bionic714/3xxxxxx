This patch is now extremely hard to find outside of paying fileplanet/gamespy/3dgamers or other such sites to download it. Frankly considering one might only ever use their site that one time for that one file, I fail to see it being worth the 5 dollars. That money would be better off donated to Demonoid here. But I digress...

This file will patch I76 of any version, though it was initially for the gold edition/arsenal. Many people have said it is a necessary patch in the process of getting Interstate 76 to run stable under windows XP. I figured people might appreciate this considering how many have been getting I76 lately.
