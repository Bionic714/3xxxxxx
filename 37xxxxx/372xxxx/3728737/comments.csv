everytime a new movie is released, then people uploads the same version a million times.
why upload cam version at all? itÂ´s useless.
wait for a proper version. "

,Windsong1,2007-07-04T04:32Z,"I can see that you did put alot of work into this torrent. I have been trying to find a good copy of the file since it came out. Two fakes  and Five tries later  I HAVE hit pay dirt, your torrent.....

Finally I can see all the credits without the bottom of the Film missing. Praise the Torrent Gods

There is no choppy frame rate the film runs quite smoothly. 

the image is quite clear and the colors bright.

The sound is good, if it is out of sync, it was very little. For the most part I could not tell.

Thank you for this Torrent Uploader. The torrent is well seeded and had a fast download time. Well worth the time. I may use this ont to boost my share ratio , it's worth the time...."
,dread-pirate,2007-07-08T05:18Z,hey ppl im pretty new here. i spent several hours d/l rise of silver surfer only to find out i cant burn it to dvd coz its a bunch of rar files or something. im not too familiar with how those work other than i can watch it on my comp. am i wrong or can these kind of files not be burnd to dvd? if not can someone point me in the direction to a copy of this movie that i can burn that looks just as good as this one. much appreciation. thanx.
,aclabombard13,2007-07-09T16:35Z,you can burn rar files to dvd. Yuou have to download winrar and extract the files. once you do that... they can be watched and burned. RAR's are great. They allow faster download times because they are smaller files!!!
