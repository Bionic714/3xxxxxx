INSTAL POWER ISO...EVEN A SHAREWARE VERSION. MOUNT IMAGE, UNPACK THE FILES FROM IMAGE TO YOUR HDD. INSTALL GAME AND COPY THE CRACK FROM ""POSTMORTEM"" FOLDER TO WHERE THE GAME IS INSTALLED. 
YOU CAN UNMOUNT THE IMAGE AND EVEN DELETE THE POWER ISO AND THE IMAGE IF YA WANT TO, YOU DONT NEED IT TO THIS GAME ANYMORE. PLAY!!!"
[T],PirateBoy,2011-02-23T18:14Z,What's new in this gold edition? Whats the difference between this and the normal Moto Racer 3? Plz reply...so that i can dwnld this!!! :)
,chmarley,2011-09-11T01:01Z,"In order to mount the image in DAEMON Tools you need to rename ""Moto Racer 3 Gold Edition.bin"" to ""pm-motog.bin"". 

The reason is that the first line of the cue file list that as the filename of the image

FILE ""pm-motog.bin"" BINARY
TRACK 01 MODE1/2352
INDEX 01 00:00:00"
