,Interpolice,2007-06-24T06:43Z,Does this differ from the previous CS3 torrents only in the promised elegance of the cracks?
,JeanCrack,2007-06-24T11:32Z,"It is only US or multilaguages ? thank you !
Sorry for my bad english :-)"
,zigman53,2007-06-25T04:50Z,Has anyone tried this yet. It downloaded fast. I'll continue to seed until . . . . .
,Nightwatch,2007-06-26T08:06Z,"It's the complete English Suite (so not multilingual) with working cracks for ALL included programs, just as the intro stated."
,popfactor,2007-06-26T18:59Z,"I downloaded, unpacked, opened the setup & authenticated, then the setup acted like it was loading, the progress bar shows it had completed loading, but then it does nothing. 

Am I doing something wrong or does it just not work properly?"
,wright0768,2007-06-26T20:45Z,I am having the same problem.  The set-up does nothing when it finishes/
,bigginger,2007-06-26T22:12Z,Worked fine here - and thank you :D
,Nightwatch,2007-06-26T22:21Z,You're welcome :-)
,Nightwatch,2007-06-26T22:23Z,"Setup takes a while, just let it do its work... First install, after that, drage the seperate apps onto the designated crack icons and use the suite without any trouble :-)"
,Vega2.5,2007-06-27T08:02Z,"I must be retarded....
Cant find the crack icon....:-(

Hilfe!"
,eyesaiditwouldberight,2007-06-27T14:16Z,i can´t open the filfe !!
,susanq,2007-06-27T20:32Z,"It wont open, please please help!!!"
,susanq,2007-06-27T20:34Z,"I dont see a crack icon! Where would that be, I've already downloaded and opened- only the ""downloaded from demonoid "" and the CS3.sitx is there. I click on the CS3. sitx and it asks me what program to open it up with."
,Nightwatch,2007-06-27T23:09Z,"Since this is an Apple OSX download, sitx can standard be opened on a Mac, using StuffIt Expander. When expanded, you'll find 2 .dmg files. The 1st contains all adobe software and the 2nd contains the cracks. You'll have to double-click on the dmg's, though (for dummies)"
,Nightwatch,2007-06-27T23:14Z,"If you have trouble opening the sitx, please download the most recent version of StuffIt Expander (version 11) from http://www.stuffit.com"
,andlabs,2007-06-28T14:01Z,I have the latest version of StuffIt Expander (11.0.2) and the .sitx file is hanging at the end. I have to force quit (not cancel) in order to stop.
,toestream,2007-06-28T16:16Z,"Everything works as advertised. BUT: After having k'd the apps, it's not possible to apply ANY of Adobe's own updates. Anyway around that? "
,andlabs,2007-06-28T18:28Z,"OK, it finally finished unextracting itself . going to test!"
,andlabs,2007-06-28T18:51Z,"OK, I'm confirming the problem that the setup program stops as sson as the Initializing window closes."
,andlabs,2007-06-28T19:55Z,"Found the problem: 5 MB is invalid, according to Transmission. Redownloading."
,andlabs,2007-06-28T19:55Z,"Never mind, I think it's a bug - I have the same problem with another torrent that actually works"
,Nightwatch,2007-06-28T22:04Z,"@toestream:

That's normal with cracked apps. Once the crack is applied, the app is ""as is"". If you want to udate to a newer version, you'll have to wait until this is published, including updated cracks."
,andlabs,2007-06-29T00:08Z,"OK, after removing everything Adobe from my system it finally worked! But I will use a serial number instead of a crack."
,andlabs,2007-06-29T00:38Z,Does anyone have a serial?
,wright0768,2007-07-02T17:35Z,that was happening to me but i just let it go and it eventually finished.  I also redownloaded this on my laptop and the setup opened no problem.  So either the first time i downloaded it something went wrong or it might be cause i have cs2 products where i dl the first time.  
,Nightwatch,2007-07-03T22:06Z,"Reloading is not necessary. Just drop the torrent in Azureus and let it check. If some parts are missing, Azureus will re-download the missing or failing parts. This will take less time than completely reloading the torrent."
,Nightwatch,2007-07-03T22:09Z,"I also tried it on another machine, also with CS2 installed, without any problem."
,atlantisflight,2007-07-04T01:19Z,"WARNING to people downloading this: This torrent contains the pre-release version of CS3, 20070222. The cracks work, but then you can't update any of the software w/ Adobe Updates. And a couple minor programs crash, e.g. VersionCue.  To get the release version (20070321), try this: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3672354/Adobe_CS3_Design_Premium_OSX 

To find out which version you have, go to Photoshop (after its installed), do a 'Get Info' and look at the Version string."
,Nightwatch,2007-07-08T11:03Z,"Duhhh, no cracked software can be updated."
,mac1guy11,2007-07-09T08:19Z,ok did the whole thing and installed just fine but the patches don't work only for adobe acrobat . everything else says that the file is not patchable.
,antonnio_mariaci,2007-07-31T20:47Z,"hi, i've got a problem! I installed abobe CS3 but when i want to use the crack (drop it in the drop zone) but then i get a signal that said "" you can't apply the patch on this file"", can you help me?"
,SikeNike,2007-09-02T23:28Z,"Does anyone have the serial number? in that case culd you caomment it in this ""blog"" please! 
thx
Sike"
,Aluvair,2007-09-21T16:50Z,I'm having the same problem that others are having. I open it with the stuffit expander and the loading bar will go all the way to the end as if it is finished but it just sits there. I left it open for like an hour. Can anyone help?
,Aluvair,2007-09-21T18:14Z,"Ok, it took about two hours but it finally ' expanded '. But now i'm having the setup problem. After clicking the setup icon, the window opens with the loading bar and after it's finished loading the window vanishes but nothing happens. I've tried like ten times. :/ "
,Permitivity,2007-09-23T06:31Z,"Please help - I patched the files just as instructed and the green ""successfully patched"" appears but when I go to open the programs that I just patched it still asks for the serial numbers and I can't find them. Thought if I just patch then I don't need the serials.. where are the serials in the file? would there be some reason why I can't just start up the programs after patching?"
,GULBLA(swe),2007-09-28T11:26Z,Does any one know where to find the Adobe CS3 Design Premium Suite in SWEDISH?
,mountain8,2007-11-10T17:14Z,"I am having the same problem...

For Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Illustrator etc. it says...

""you can't apply the patch on this file"" 

...only the Acrobat crack works!!!

Help !!!!

Thanks in advance"
,cangoalie,2007-12-08T20:52Z,"So I downloaded a bunch of trial CS3 apps onto my computer, do I have to get rid of them before running this?
If so, how? The uninstall isn't working. Can I just delete the folders in my Applications folder on the HD? 
Thanks,
sorry if this is a n00b question...."
,cangoalie,2007-12-09T18:54Z,"It worked! It worked!
For the other n00bs out there, this is what I did: I ran the ""Setup"" program, opened InDesign, entered serial no. 1326-0110-5569-6121-4741-2255 
Then it asked me to buy an e-Licence. I quit and downloaded this: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3656499/Adobe_Creative_Suite_CS3_Premium_Crack
Then I simply dragged the applications into the drop zone in this file and it worked perfectly!
THANK YOU SOOO MUCH TO THE UPLOADERS OF BOTH FILES!!!!"
,Got-it,2008-01-12T01:12Z,"The reason why expanding is keeping you hanging up at the end is because you need to update Stuff-it Expander to  version 12 (the latest version). If you get info about the file that is expanding you will see the size of the file going up while it is expanding. If the size info is not going up, It's not working... don't waste your time close it and try the new version of stuff it expander, try again. It takes a long time to expand so be sure the file size is going up. Trial and error, that's what it's all about with computer/software problems. Took me all day to figure it out :( but happy I did :). Enjoy!"

,Caiaphas,2008-02-20T13:43Z,A sitx file? Ar eyou kidding? use zip or make it an ISO so we don't have to download stuffit expander or the like.

,nextuser,2008-03-24T23:44Z,"sorry if i sound nooby, but is this torrent still alive? i can't seem to download even though it has seeders and leechers. i was downloading from home where torrents work. i even asked my friend to do it for me on his comp, but it didn't work either. no connections being made. as far as i know it can't be my firewall or his because we've successfully downloaded torrents in the past.
it would be great if someone could pm me the info... but i think that's wishful thinking. haha"
,davidov69,2008-04-10T20:56Z,Blackoutmemoria ... did you ever find Photoshop?  Same-thing happened here ... 
,ifinza,2008-04-28T22:06Z,i have cs3 installed and cracked. will i be able to update normally in the future with out a new crack?

,libdemguy,2008-05-19T18:14Z,"hi, im sort of new to torrents and i have the same problem as many people: everytime that I open up the setup folder, it initializes the setup and then just quits. people seem to have figured out how to fix it and can someone write the solution up please! thank you!"
,minicrazy592,2008-06-27T01:52Z,Can you possibly post the cracks separate or know where I can get them?
,dann_e,2008-09-05T07:55Z,Kan någon seeda ut den här i ett par timmar... / Can someone please seed this one for  atleast a couple of hours??
