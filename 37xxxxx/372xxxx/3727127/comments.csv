,cyberdjay,2007-06-29T10:50Z,"Seriously.  If any of you ever have any distrust in the powers that be, you really need to see this.  There needs to be change!  Watch this movie any way you can and share it with all the ones you care for.  Trust me."
,TrinitronX,2007-06-29T12:33Z,"This is definitely a powerful movie. No matter what opinion you hold beforehand, you will come out seeing reality differently.

This movie is simply amazing. No matter what opinion you have on any of the parts of this film.... WATCH THEM!!! Start opening your mind and ask questions, digg deeper ;), THINK, comment, discuss, spread it. There's no denying that some of the topics addressed in this film are incendiary. Step aside Micheal Moore...

,redox1,2007-07-09T12:16Z,Is not playing. I think I've got my codecs covered. Haven't had any other problems. Any details on encoding?
,rawwwe,2007-07-10T01:21Z,"For redox1.
BSPlayer and Windows Media players didn't play it. But Media Player Classic did."
,redox1,2007-07-10T09:33Z,"Thanks rawwwe. For anyone else who needs it http://www.free-codecs.com/Media_Player_Classic_download.htm . I was surpised winamp wouldn't play it :/
 I've just watched part one - very impressive. Having studied the area extensively in the past I can verify that most of what it says is true. I'll be hittin the books to check the few areas i've missed but on the whole, these guys have done their homework.
 Highly recommended"
