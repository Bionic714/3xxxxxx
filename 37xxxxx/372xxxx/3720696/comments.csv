,Asymov,2008-05-31T02:26Z,"I want to first thank you for providing excellent, hard to find movies. I'm interested in knowing what I have to do in order to view movies with subtitles (but not in VLC). Is there a way to use the subtitle files in Winblows Media Player 11, or other media player? (I'm not particularly interested in using VLC, given that I would like to use a media player with the codec pack I've already installed in my XPSP2 OS.) Please advise."

,zarniwooproosta,2009-05-28T09:00Z,"to get subtitles to work the .srt file and the .avi file have to be named the exact same

the .avi file has typo ""os"" instead of ""or""....change that and it should work automatically.

seed and help keep classic art films alive!"
