You don't know a shit about it :-D"
,Interrobang,2007-07-23T00:34Z,And it's not even the entire album to begin with - it's three versions (radio edit + 2 remixes) of the 'Tour de France' tune.
,folderol,2007-11-29T00:55Z,"Yeah, what they said.  AND, it's not the ""Tour de France"", it's the Tour of France.  My spellchecker says so!  And Kraftwork weren't from the eighties, they were from the 70's thru till now!  And you speeled Kraftwork wrong.  Its C-R-A-F-T-W-O-R-K.  Jeez!!  Why'd you even bother posting anything for us?  You are just too stupid to give anything for free for us to download.  You lose!!  Game over!!  Good day to you sir.
(Notice to anyone that reads this post and thinks I'm serious.  I'm not.  I'm pointing out that anyone that complains about free stuff is an ASSHAT!!!!  The above post is complete sarcasm)"
,folderol,2007-11-29T00:59Z,"Oh yeah, thanks for the upload.  I had never heard of this group 'till I read about them in a online story.  Just thought I'd see what it was about, and yours was the smallest up here.  Preciated!!!"
