,chaliceofweewee,2007-06-29T21:52Z,"Glad to see it. The guy's been ignored for too long. Got a lot of misc. stuff I'll have to put up. He's like gold-dust on the interweb. Got the 8 track Demo by Lucy Wainwright Roche which I must say, is excellent!! Let me know if you want it. Throwing out a request for Therapy (I miss that album)."

,AllenKey,2008-03-16T21:59Z,"Yeah, that's great stuff, from old Album II isn't it? Thanks for all your fun Loudon uploads chalice! Today I  remembered ""Tomorrow was St Patricks Day"" since that's the case today :-) A friend used to have those first albums on LP and we'd play them all the time, but now my friend is  gone... so if anyone has them early albums I would reeally appreciate a torrent, and I promise to seed :-)"
