,weeballuk1,2007-07-12T18:56Z,"How embarrassing, its a real fake that mike and kevin have recorded themselves...pretty funny actually.  I looked on the site and they only want $2.99 (ÂŁ1.50 ish) for each rifftrax and it made me think that it better to just buy them.  At least that way they will do more in the future"
