,oldfield1,2007-06-26T04:15Z,"are you expecting audiophile recordings? even if i have decent high-end:ish audio system, i wouldnt notice difference easy to my original sources in most cases if listening with normal volume.
maybe you dont have any glue how much that all would take in flac format...i have mede these for easy listening and my personal mo live database purposes in first place."
,beenbee,2007-06-26T17:44Z,"Thanks again!
Keep them coming!
I have a lot of them in Flac format and I have to agree that in most cases you can hardly hear the difference usually because of the master recording quality.
