Eat Me, Drink Me is Marilyn Manson\'s sixth studio album, released worldwide on June 5, 2007. Eat Me, Drink Me was recorded in a rented home-recording studio in Hollywood, California by lead vocalist Marilyn Manson and guitarist and bassist Tim Sköld. A press-conference with Manson in April 2007 revealed that the album itself was a collaboration strictly between himself and Tim Sköld, causing speculation as to who performed the apparent drum and keyboard duties. It was produced by Marilyn Manson and Tim Sköld, and mixed by Sean Beavan.[2] It has been stated that there were originally around 20 embryonic songs, all written by Sköld, 2 of which (that didn\'t make the album) Manson considered complete with lyrics and vocals. Manson stated that he had a difficult time cutting some of them, but felt he had to in order to prevent the album from being \"diluted\".[3] It was released in two versions: a standard and a special collector\'s edition on June 5, 2007.
