,schmocker,2007-08-03T07:19Z,"I downloaded the file which unfortunately took about six days to complete at an average 12 Kb/s and when I tried to unzip using WinRAR I got an error: ""Either multi-part or corrupt ZIP archive"" and the zip file just won't extract?!?  Any cures anyone?  Am I the only one this happened to?  I am continuing to seed it, regardless...
Thanks, J."
,gibson1960,2007-08-05T03:02Z,Can you plzz seed! Im begging on my ass here!
,osbjoerlo,2007-08-05T12:51Z,seed pls
,schmocker,2007-08-05T20:02Z,"Gibson1960 & osbjoerlo,

  I am seeding with upload limit set to ""Unlimited"" and ""Allocation"" set to high?  Speed doesn't seem to be going any higher than 6 or 7 kB/s though.  
  Hopefully you will have better luck than I did regarding my last post... The file appears to be corrupt.  Let me know if you get it working cuz I'd really like to watch these movies."
,refhl,2007-08-27T18:12Z,dont't download this shit! the .zip-file doesn't work!

,warcorpse,2008-02-17T15:51Z,"The zip file seems corrupt and wont work with most of the unzip tools.
After some tryouts i managed it with the newest version of Quickzip (freeware ofc)"
,Acker,2008-02-21T16:58Z,"Worked just fine here with me, used 42hrs and 21mins downloading.

No problem with extraction or anything else, I just opened the file directly in WinRAR.

And at last, thank you for not subbing this, many of those Swedish morons destroy all the good movies with their STUPID subtitles."
,vhin_nivram,2008-02-28T01:03Z,"the zip file is corrupted..i can't extract anything.
just a waste of time and bandwith..."
,slickrick668,2008-03-23T19:55Z,"Using Bitlord and cant seem to get this one to start, though it is reading 65 seeds and 192 leechers. No tracker error reported."
,evelorc,2008-03-23T21:06Z,"Great, works fantastic! Thanks man!
Just took me 4 h to download.

For those who dont get it to work use 7zip, it worked for me."
,Tobbe750,2008-03-25T21:05Z,N책gon som vet om det finns svensk text till filmerna?
,ezboard,2008-03-30T21:25Z,"Look, open the goddamn ZIP file with windows explorer like a normal folder (windows XP and above). If you can't do this, get a newer computer and quit your bitching!! 
Though this SHOULD NOT BE ONE HUGE FUCKING ZIP FILE, what about those of us who only want to download a certain movie and not the others?!?!"
,black_drakma,2008-04-03T19:17Z,"ok guys im gonna say this once
to get this running download the free ver of winrar and open the zip file with it
drag and drop the movies to wherever you want
its that simple"
,frontier-lol,2008-04-23T16:46Z,"the zip file is sort off corrupted, the first zip program i used failed to even open it. however with a program falled 7zip i was able to get all the file out problem free. all is as promised, dvd rips.
dl 7zip here : http://www.7-zip.org/"
,zadig1,2008-04-30T18:42Z,"Good upload,thanks!"
,RebelBlacksheep,2008-05-09T05:25Z,"Hey you leechy motherfuckers.
I've downloaded 1.89Gb, and uploaded 2.91Gb.
Either someone starts settiing their upload limits higher or I'll drop mine down from 500Kb to 1, and you douchebags will take even longer to download. And someone needs to fucking seed this ._."
,anver,2008-05-14T18:33Z,The quickzip didn't work for me but the 7-zip did!
,PAWZ76,2008-05-15T14:13Z,"Small size vids for the size of the file, but ok quality. Thanks.
