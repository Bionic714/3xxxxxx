,Hojew,2009-11-15T07:20Z,Ha!  Ratio padding!  On the Pirate Bay!  HAHAHAHAHA!

,QuaintBelial,2012-05-10T03:06Z,"Tracks 08, 14, 19, 25, 28 will not play in anything I've tried. They aren't recognized as MP3s at all and VLC tells me I don't have a proper codec or something to play MP3s which is untrue. MPC just errors and doesn't try at all.  I've redownloaded them off the linked site in the description with the same problem. "
