Marvel Zombies is a comic book miniseries, published by Marvel Comics. The series 
is set in an alternate version of the Marvel Universe (Earth-2149)[1] where almost 
all superheroes and super villains have become flesh-eating zombies. The series was 
written by Robert Kirkman and illustrated by Sean Phillips, with painted covers by 
Arthur Suydam; it ties in with an Ultimate Fantastic Four story and has proved a 
breakout hit with a prequel one-shot & crossover miniseries and appearances by its 
characters in other Marvel titles.

The zombie universe resembles a classic incarnation of the Marvel Universe (several 
characters like Luke Cage wear their seventies costumes), with slight differences 
such as Captain America being Colonel America.  The Army of Darkness crossover expands 
this by showing zombie versions of Howard the Duck and Runaways, as well as an appearance 
by Nextwave.
