,diet_theory,2008-05-09T01:51Z,"To read .cbr-files, use CDisplay"
,Maou,2008-05-11T07:44Z,Great stuff. I'd like to see Black Panther #29-31 though.
,LadyAmbar,2008-05-28T13:48Z,Freaking sweet!
,klark4204,2008-07-15T16:52Z,"CDisplay is the best way to look at .cbr files. I've tried a few and CD works the smoothest. One other thing, why don't people try googling their questions and finding the answers themselves, it can give you a great sense of accomplishment to know that you found an answer without asking."
