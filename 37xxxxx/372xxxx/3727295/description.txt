'Everything Is Average Nowadays' is the second single
lifted from Kaiser Chief's recent longplayer, 'Yours
Truly, Angry Mob'. Arriving on the back of the Number One
single 'Ruby', 'Everything Is Average Nowadays' finds the
band spitting with faux vitriol, and is the thread linking
'Yours Truly...' with their debut album 'Employment'.
