,motherloader,2007-06-25T04:40Z,dont do it....    
,unrar,2007-06-25T05:40Z,don't do what?
,unrar,2007-06-25T08:38Z,there are a lot of people downloading but no comments. show some love! this was hard to get.
,jgabriel,2007-06-25T09:04Z,"Maybe there are no comments because nobody's completed the download successfully yet. At least that's what the statistics above indicate.

Then there's the issue that it's in the .dat format. Which could be an image file of some kind ... or could be anything, including a virus or trojan.

And, of course, there's no sample for verification.

Nor are there any other torrents listed under your handle.

*Sigh*

Finally, you say: ""i have searched extensively for this on torrent sites, but haven't found it on here.""

But there's already a torrent of this movie available here:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3718865/Aqua.Teen.Hunger.Force.2007.DVDRip.XviD-M337W4D

So... I suspect a lot of people are waiting to finish downloading the torrent, and to see if it's
A) real, and 
B) of acceptable quality.
before ""showing the love"".

Alternately, any future people wanting to d/l this film might want to check out the link listed above, which already shows several hundred successful downloads -- without any posted complaints.

,unrar,2007-06-26T00:36Z,this torrent is dead. sorry. i thought there were no copies on here. download the other one. sorry guys.
