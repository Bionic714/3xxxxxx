,greenfrog,2007-06-24T23:05Z,"I though global warming was too much hype.  Then I saw Al Gore's movie and was shocked to think that it might not be hype after all.  But once I saw this, it showed Al Gore to be partially responsible for the hype and his facts to be partially erroneous as well.
Basically C02 never changed the climate.  Meaning we can drive huge SUV's forever and it wont change the temperature.
Its the SUN that caused the temperature to go up, which caused forests and then animals to prospers, which in turn causes c02 to go up.
The NY Times article (3/13/2007), said, ""scientists argue that some of Mr. Gore?s central points are exaggerated and erroneous""
because he fails to point out that his C02 vs Temp chart not only shows Temp coming before C02 (not the other way around that he portrays), but most importantly, that the gap is 820 years!
If any change could be made to the planet, which man-made c02 cannot, the resulting change show fruit until the year 2800."

This ""Climate Swindle"" debate is a selfish and highly egoistic LIE which could (and maybe WILL) harm humanity as a whole; and it will much more harm the following generations which did not participate in inducing Global Warming. WE are responsible for THEM, and I do not want my children to suffer for what I could not stop.

,russell1nash,2007-06-25T01:47Z,"well, it would be just great if people will comment on teh quality of this post, and only after that state their opinions! since this is a conversion, i assume no subs, no xtras, but at least the video/audio specs would be nice!
Thanx!"
,El Jafar,2007-06-25T01:48Z,"Zukure: Have you ever thought of that the current CO2 in athmosphere is 0.05%? Man & nature has raised it by 0.02% last 100 years. At the same time temperature has raised 0.5C. Looking back last half million year, the temp max-min differs 10C and CO2 0.02%.

Before cyanobacterias started to convert CO2 to O2, the CO2 level should have been about 20% as it is 21% O2 today. That is a raise 400 times greater! How did the oceans form in that hellish temperature? Remember that water vapor is also climate driving.

Another one; If earth were an apple, the skin represent what we know of the planet, i.e. the surface, oceans and athmospere. The sun is 333.000 times bigger and all is burning with millions C in the middle and ""only"" 6000C on surface. Even on our distance the heat radiation warming our planet 300C. And you think that a change of CO2 of 0.0002 in that tiny skin layer of one apple is causing 10C heat difference in past (and 0.5C now)?!?

Hey, don't cry. You are not alone to be fooled. There were a time when everybody just knew that earth were flat and the centre of universe. Saying otherwise and the church executed you.

,kovesp,2007-06-25T02:44Z,"The Romans had a principle that they applied when trying to decide what evidence could be trusted in a (admittedly, usually legal) case.  They asked: ""Cui bono?"" --- who does it benefit?

Now it is clear to me that adopting stringent emissions controls is not to the benefit the large manufacturing corporations, however I do not see how it benefits the advocates of such controls.

The global warming debate has been around for at least 30 years. At first there were a few scientist (designated cranks) talking about it with mass rejection by the mainstream  scientific community as a whole.

By today this has turned around. Now it is the few odd cranks and hacks who still insist that climate change is a myth. It is not that they don't believe in what they say, but I am sure that the fat checks they get for their pseudo-scientific nonsense in support of the ""No Warming"" agenda serves as good reinforcement."
,El Jafar,2007-06-25T12:45Z,"kovesp: You forgot something, political idealism! It is an even better driving force than money. There are a bunch of environmentalists who don't want you to drive any car at all, even that they don't gain any money from it. Compare them to islamic fundamentalists and you might understand them better. Or try figure out who gained money on the fact that earth once was flat?

UN's climat experts, IPCC, was originally created by Magret Thatcher to help her motivate more nuclear power plants after Harrisburg. She had problem with sheiks (who stopped pumping oil when it pleased them) and english cole miners who were on strike all the time. IPCC only gave funding to all scientific research saying bad things about coal and oil.

A question to you kovesp. Have you looked at the evidence for and against CO2? I have! I found that there are no evidence for! Yes, you read it correct. I couldnĂ¤t find any evidence for. They drilled into the ice of Greenland end 1980, beginning 1990. Conclusion: CO2 followstemperature with a delay of 800 years and not the other way around. An evidence against CO2. That was bad so they drilled in the ice in Antartica. Same results! You look at temperature last 100 years. Once again, it doesn't look the way it should have done if CO2 were the cause of temperature. The sun activity does on the other hand compare quite good to the temperature last 500 years. An evidence for sun activity theory."
,ZombieBunny,2007-06-25T12:48Z,Does it really matter if global warming exists and/or is man made? The fact is the polar ice is melting at an alarming rate and youd have to be an utter retard not to realize the effects on the worlds population when the glass overfills.
,ZombieBunny,2007-06-25T12:52Z,furthermore: http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/03/swindled-carl-wunsch-responds/ that says it all.
,El Jafar,2007-06-25T14:36Z,"Zombiebunner: Climate changes all the time. Where I sit right now, there were 3km of ice about 10.000 years ago.

A retard like me thinks (unlike you) that stopping manmade CO2 means that global dimming gets less, which means we probably get an even higher temperature. ItÂ´s better to put money on what to do instead of feeding those environment fundamentalists with campain money for their holy crusade against modern way of living. The danish guys working on the solar activity theory have (after the film were made) made a successful experiment were they prooved cosmic radiation is neccessary to form clouds. http://www.spacecenter.dk/research/sun-climate/other/global-warming-and-cosmic-radiation If we give such serious science money, that might end up in for example a machine that can create clouds to cool down earth.

Yeah, the link tells you how journalists work, not that he said any lies. Do you think the CO2-propaganda work indifferent?"

,mac.the.ripper,2007-06-26T01:05Z,"Please....

The average temerature in Antarctica is - 37C.
What the fuck is melting?

The icecap in Arctic is a layer of floating ice in the sea. The ice on the north pole is just as thick as a sub easily can brake through it.  Well, what the fuck is Archimedes principle of boyancy?

The actual rise in temperatures will eventually melt all the ice on Greenland. It will take 25.000 years to free the iceland from the ice. Correct me if IÂ´m wrong, but it is less than 2000 years since good old Jesus left the planet earth.

The neofascist apostels of Al Gore and the IPPC tells us that sealevels will raise 64 metres in the next 50 years. Sieg heil to the new reign of fear!

Cui bono?

Haha...seriously...cui bono? The Media, the media, the media and the coward politicians who knows that the day will come when they have to explain to their voters why the chineese econemy is dominating the world and why the western world, as we know it, lay in ruins....

Nice upload, Greenfrog. "
,greenfrog,2007-06-26T03:02Z,"Your welcome people.  If you could, please post about the quality as people have been asking for a 3rd party opinion.  Pal to Ntsc pulldown and sync doesnt always come out correctly."
,ya2sin,2007-06-26T14:08Z,"""The fact remains that in a sample of 928 peer-reviewed scientific papers published between 1993-2003 not one disagreed with the consensus position that human activity is causing climate change.""

""Moreover, while the programme-makers labelled the source of their world temperature data as 'NASA', the Independent found no such graph existed.""

(We feel swindled. Indeed we are not the only ones: Carl Wunsch (who was a surprise addition to the cast) was apparently misled into thinking this was going to be a balanced look at the issues (the producers have a history of doing this), but who found himself put into a very different context indeed.)

Prof Wunsch's complaint is that the documentary is no more than propaganda. ""I was misled as to what it was going to be about,"" he now says. ""I was told about six months ago that this was to be a programme about how complicated it is to understand what is going on. If they had told me even the title of the programme, I would have absolutely refused to be on it.""

""In October 1998 a television producer named Martin Durkin took a proposal to the BBC?s science series, Horizon. Silicone breast implants, he claimed, far from harming women, were in fact beneficial, reducing the risk of breast cancer. Horizon commissioned a researcher to find out whether or not his assertion was true. After a thorough review, the researcher reported that Mr Durkin had ignored a powerful body of evidence contradicting his claims. Martin Durkin withdrew his proposal. Instead of dropping it, however, he took it to Channel 4 and, astonishingly, sold it to their science series, Equinox.""

""Mr Durkin has often been accused of taking liberties with the facts. In 1997 he made a series for Channel 4 called ?Against Nature?, which compared environmentalists with Nazis, conspiring against the world?s poor. No one would suggest that green claims should not be subjected to critical examination, but the people he interviewed were lied to about the contents of the programmes and given no chance to respond to the accusations the series made.""

,El Jafar,2007-06-26T22:46Z,"ya2sin: Always the same story from the CO2-guys. ""There are this many scientists (read fundamentalists) saying that CO2 is the answer."" Complete lack of evidence for CO2 is always totally uninteresting.

I checked the first link, which contained a lot of text. Same shit here. About half of the story were about the danish scientists and there solar activity. He claims the program to faked the data completely and show a measure of solar activity from NASA. It took me 3 minutes to find the source on internet. It was in the danish scientists report (suprised?) and did not show solar activity, but the time between two solar activity minimums. Why they looked at the length was out of his understanding as he didn't read their reports. Rest of his conclusion in that matter is hence rubbish! He even added a link to a site telling that 11 scientists (read fundamentalists) examined the danish report closely and said they used 40 million year old metors as data for todays sun radiation. The report says they used solar spot observation. In other words, they havn't even read the report and yet they claim to have closely examined it!

1. CO2-models does not fit into long term history. Neither ice ages, nor 4 billion years ago.
2. CO2-models does not fit in short term (last 150 years).
3. A change of CO2 in atmosphere of 0.0002 gives 10C historical does not trig any warning signs at all. Specially not when earth had CO2 over 1% back into time.
4. You drill into Greenlands ice cap. Find out proof against CO2.
5. You drill into Antarctic ice cap. Same results.
6. Some scientists find another theori that matches temperature curves. You start to say their science is falsified.
7. They successfully made a practical experiment that is partly proof of their theory.

What is the matter with you CO2-fanatics?!? Next time people talking about how it is possible to brainwash muslim fundamentalists so they see nothing but a narrow corridore of the world, I'll give you as an outstanding example of today."
,greenfrog,2007-06-27T09:19Z,"There is an American program called The Climate of Fear by Glenn Beck from CNN also debunking GW.  You can find the whole thing on youtube.com.  But the best thing in it was the explanation of why the US doesnt support Kyoto.  The reason is because 'developing' countries are completely excluded, including China which will be producing more co2 than the US by next friday!  The funny thing is however, that the US 'stance' was developed in 1990 and Clinton and Bush just maintain this everytime it comes up.  Guess who made this decision for the US in 1990...??  yup, Al Gore!"
,ottoniemi,2007-06-30T23:38Z,"You people that do no believe in the Green House effect, ask for example the Greeks. A couple days ago the temperature in Greece was up to a record 47 Celsius. That coupled with brown-outs because more and more people install air-conditioning in homes and businesses cause shortages to electricity. I heard from friends that it was quite unbearable.

I moved to the city I now live in, 20 years ago. When I first moved here, the air was the best quality, top of the scale. Now it is almost all year around just inside the safety limits of the scale. I too like my car and all the other goodies, but how long can it go like this.

The businesses? Quartal-mentality at the moment does not encourage them to do long time research, just take the money the easiest possible and fastest way and run, as the saying goes.

In my opinion, what governments around the world at least should do, is introduce bills that demand for example that cars should in five years time run on less fuel, or that electric appliances run with half the electricity, and in ten years time consume even less energy, and so on. That would force the manufactures to do more research if they want to stay in business. Even if the future products cost at the beginning a little more money, so what, people will pay. I remember for example that I paid for my first computer, a 486 25 Mhz SX, almost 2000 euros and I didn?t grumble.

So what I?m saying is, there are things that can be done, but unfortunately they have to be imposed from above. Because no matter what the Americans are saying, that private sector will solve the problems voluntary, I personally don?t see it happening."
,El Jafar,2007-07-08T00:48Z,"Well, in Sweden (where both pirate bay and I live) the goverment is hiding. They don't want to decide what the cars will use for energy source, but say that the industry must take that decision. You are not allowed to build more hydro plants or neclear plants in this f*cking country. So, how can we get all the energy needed to replace oil?!? We can't! Hence the industry can't solve it either.

Today there is only one single source that can give us replacement energy for oil and that is nuclear. Lucky enough we got plenty of uranium. Unlucky some leaders in the world are not technicans and can calculate themselves to that conclusion."
,xohp,2007-07-11T23:43Z,"I'm not convinced that the global warming is human created myself, I do find that the phenomenon is being abused, for a good cause though. We should strive to be innovative and cause minimal stress to the environment we live in, it's just sad to see how only panic can really motivate people to do so..."
,greenfrog,2007-08-14T07:16Z,"Common misconception to think combating 'global warming' has no dire consequences.  In fact, its quite the contrary.  For example, the Enviromentalists are forcing developing countries not to produce the cheap economical power plants that we in the developed world have.  This leads to hundreds of thousands of deaths since no electricity means medicine is virtually non-existant ( no refrigeration), rampant respiratory disease (indoor fires to cook).
The reason why modern society lives healthier and longer lives is primarily because of electricity.  But Al Gore says no to that for all the developing country's."
,oldngrey,2007-10-17T21:20Z,"The Big Myth! Global warming.
The film ""An Incovenient Truth"" would make a great presentation if it would tell you the truth about global warming , it's quick flashing scenes and ill begotten music gave me a sense of forbodding and doesn't not help to convey a sense of workable energy alternatives, this film made me feel helpless and depressed. Much of the film is with Al Gore without anyone really backing up his views , it is like a big ego trip.My conclusion is if you want a pure disaster horror film then this is the one for you, but if you want a unbiased view of global temperature change then look to the bbc horizion documentary about global climate change. the nobel prize has lost all of its meaning and prestige since Al Gore got his. If anyone believes that humans causes global warming is either ignorant or having an agenda. Al Gore does have an agenda, look at his new company which buys and sells carbon credits, instant money for nothing.The ""Greener"" religion just doesn't standup to Scientific facts. Al Gore would sell his mother for a little feel good publicity. Alfred Nobel is probably rolling in his grave over what the Nobel prize become. The Nobel Peace Prize had lost it prestige long ago when it was given to Arafat, the father of modern terrorism.

The nine alleged errors in the film
# Mr Gore claims that a sea-level rise of up to 20 feet would be caused by melting of either West Antarctica or Greenland ""in the near future"". The judge said: ""This is distinctly alarmist and part of Mr Gore's ""wake-up call"". He agreed that if Greenland melted it would release this amount of water - ""but only after, and over, millennia"".""The Armageddon scenario he predicts, insofar as it suggests that sea level rises of seven metres might occur in the immediate future, is not in line with the scientific consensus.""

# The film claims that low-lying inhabited Pacific atolls ""are being inundated because of anthropogenic global warming"" but the judge ruled there was no evidence of any evacuation having yet happened.

# The documentary speaks of global warming ""shutting down the Ocean Conveyor"" - the process by which the Gulf Stream is carried over the North Atlantic to western Europe. Citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the judge said that it was ""very unlikely"" that the Ocean Conveyor, also known as the Meridional Overturning Circulation, would shut down in the future, though it might slow down.

# Mr Gore claims that two graphs, one plotting a rise in C02 and the other the rise in temperature over a period of 650,000 years, showed ""an exact fit"". The judge said that, although there was general scientific agreement that there was a connection, ""the two graphs do not establish what Mr Gore asserts"".

# Mr Gore says the disappearance of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro was directly attributable to global warming, but the judge ruled that it scientists have not established that the recession of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro is primarily attributable to human-induced climate change.

# The film contends that the drying up of Lake Chad is a prime example of a catastrophic result of global warming but the judge said there was insufficient evidence, and that ""it is apparently considered to be far more likely to result from other factors, such as population increase and over-grazing, and regional climate variability.""

# Mr Gore blames Hurricane Katrina and the consequent devastation in New Orleans on global warming, but the judge ruled there was ""insufficient evidence to show that"".

# Mr Gore cites a scientific study that shows, for the first time, that polar bears were being found after drowning from ""swimming long distances - up to 60 miles - to find the ice"" The judge said: ""The only scientific study that either side before me can find is one which indicates that four polar bears have recently been found drowned because of a storm.""That was not to say there might not in future be drowning-related deaths of bears if the trend of regression of pack ice continued - ""but it plainly does not su"
