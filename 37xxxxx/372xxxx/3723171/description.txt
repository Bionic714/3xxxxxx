A debunking of the current global warming fraternity:

\"Campaigners say the time for debate is over.  Any criticism, no matter how scientifically rigorous, is illegitimate.  Even worse, dangerous.
But in this film, it will be shown that the earth\'s climate is always changing.  That there is nothing unusual about the current temperature, and the scientific evidence does not support the notion that climate is driven by carbon dioxide(c02), man-made or otherwise.
Everywhere you are being told that man-made climate change is proved beyond doubt. But you are being told, lies.\" 


Quotes:
 
\"There is no direct evidence which links 20th century global warming to anthroprogenic [man-made] greenhouse gasses.\"

\"We can\'t say that C02 will drive climate, it certainly never did in the past.\"

\"The global warming alarm is dressed up as science.  But its not science, its propaganda.\"

\"[we are being told that]If the C02 increases in the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas, then the temperature will go up.  But the ice-core records shows exactly the opposite.  So the fundamental assumption, the most fundamental assumption, the assumption of the whole theory of climate change due to humans is shown to be wrong.\"
