,MrGrimReaper,2010-03-21T20:04Z,"I checked the MD5 hash of this file and it checks out as an accurate BIOS file (given the hash I checked against was right).

Thank you for the upload. ^.^"
,CodaBrink,2010-08-21T19:29Z,"Wow, downloaded instantly. Only 16KB tho. :P"
,zzk2001,2010-10-22T01:49Z,"For bios to work on No$GBA you must re-name to 

GBA.ROM

If you don't re-name it then the emulator will just Freeze. "
,elcapizzo,2011-04-06T08:09Z,"Thought I needed this for Tiger GBA EMU for Android, however it wasn't. You need to install the required BIOS ROM through the EMU app and then it works."
,deathking16132,2011-06-14T12:05Z,Hell ya props man worked great. Will seed for a week.
,contown,2011-06-18T00:43Z,"Can someone help me out? I downloaded the bios from an emulator app because of what elcapizzo said, but it still says I need the bios files.

Help please?"
