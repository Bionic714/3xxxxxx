  Risen from the ashes of thrash metal act Denata, Tomas
  Andersson and Roger Blomberg teams up with Mique Flesh
  (ex. Witchery/Seance) and invokes new musical spirits
  summoned in hell?s fire. The idea and hunger for a new
  project soon formed into what now has been unleashed as
  Freevil. The idea was to create something diverging from
  their natural influences and create something new and
  unexpected. Just going with riffs that felt good ? not
  caring to much where on the metal brutality Richter scale
  they fitted ? as long as they ROCKED in the widest but
  still deepest sense of the word.

  After some intense rehearsal sessions of blood, sweat and
  fears ? ten songs were formed and recorded in the cultural
  asylum known as Studio HellSmell, where Mique entered the
  throne as studio engineer. With a hellish troika of Tomas
  (guitar/addition vocals), Mique (drums and vocals) and
  Roger (bass armageddon) their first opus was
  eternalized/infernalized in 2006/2007. And a fourth
  character was also brought in to do some additional synths
  and FX; the spirit of composer Phanatos was also added to
  heat things up even more - in this tasteful witches brew
  of raw yet sophisticated timeless metal bearing the sign
  of Freevil.

  After completion of the recording sessions, and detailed
  mixing early 2007, the material was mastered by Peter In
  de Betou (Dimmu Borgir, Marduk, Dark Funeral etc) and the
  material was brought up the last notch of hell?s circles,
  to be unleashed in this demented world known as Earth.

  So prepare yourself for some straightjacket fun, some
  mindblowing sophisticated yet raw ? raw yet sophisticated
  in your face metal that will charm or haunt you?or maybe
  both!

  Soon Freevil shall unleash these eternal infernal flames
  entitled Freevil Burning!!

  Enjoy!

  Our philosophy is quality music and we don\'t care for the
  dupechecks.
  If we like the album and it\'s hard to find maybe we choose
  to release it.

  We will never release any crap only to \"win the race\".

  Our releases are made for sharing, not to sitting by
  ourselves jerking off to...
