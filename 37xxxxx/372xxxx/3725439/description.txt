Album notes 
Otto Von Schirach: Mr. Pineapple, Yarlen, Vieja Gladys (vocals); Nick Reyes (guitar); Seth Vanhorn, Kosmik Neil Trigger.
Combine an artist with a fascination for all things pervy and scatological, an unbridled musical imagination, and a tricked-out laptop computer, and you get the electronica-meets-porn-metal of Otto Von Schirach. MAXIPAD DETENTION is a compendium of grinding industrial beats, sounds that appear to issue from the bowels of particularly unsanitary robots, and a kind of futuristic synthetic rap that will shock those of a delicate disposition while being catnip to fans of electronic excess.
