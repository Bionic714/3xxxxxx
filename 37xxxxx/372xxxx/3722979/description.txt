\"America\'s youth is bored....numb to the kidneys by MTV, malls and the deathly roar of Thrash and Grunge....................

They seek out wilderness. They hunger isolation. They crave mortification. So they take to the air in B.A.S.E. jumps, pass high over the earth at 90mph astride a dirtbike, searching for mere seconds of Nirvana. Others skate to die, surf angry or pierce their flesh and hang out on the portch where grandpa once sat in his rocking chair.
Physical Graffiti treads the road to glory with America\'s leading and finest.\"
