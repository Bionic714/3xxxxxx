,zander666,2008-10-11T22:37Z,"When is this going to be seeded again? I noticed noone has it fully downloaded but only most the way. I would be willling to trade by the way i have most of 2000,2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006 Pretty much all of em up to 2006 then i have most of that year. I want these torrents badly to complete my discography of radio 1. Maybe a trade off. email me Zandermanretuurns@gmail.com
I want 94,95,96,97,98,99 "
,DR_ZAXXON,2008-10-30T14:46Z,"Hello, Sorry for the long delay I am seeding all my sets again , however I will need some good dedicated seeders to help push the songs around.  I have seen some comments / questions regarding the sets.  I would like to re-irradiate that this is my collection I have toted with me and picked up many songs from different sources.  I personally recorded a few but mostly are not my recording.  I have noticed there are a couple of songs duplicated in some of the years.  I guess they re played them at a later date to fill air time.  I do not have a good depth of knowledge regarding to the history and set up and such.  Im just a fan who enjoys the different mixes. (In fact there are many I have not even listened to yet).  So please enjoy and seed.  I m looking for all of 2008 and 2006.  ICQ @ 2144080 if you can help!"
