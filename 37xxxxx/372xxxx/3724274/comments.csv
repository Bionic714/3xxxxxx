,nightsongz2,2007-06-26T07:53Z,The screenshots in the link above show it stretched out to widescreen...it's not...it's 4:3. Just letting people know. ;-)
,tsw_gnaget,2007-06-26T10:32Z,"thx!
Why doesn't ABC show this in widescreen(16:9) anymore?"
,Hybrid_Pirate,2007-06-26T13:08Z,"Here the thing about Kyle XY. It airs first at Mondays with ""bad"" or low resolution on ABC Family, and later on it will show in HD.
But that happens every Friday or Thursday (can't remember which day, but it is around the end of the week).

Anyway... I was hoping someone post up S02E02 for me in HD, but not a HR version?
Like the BlueTV did on episode S02E01. Please?"
