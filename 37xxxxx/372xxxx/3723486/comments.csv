,Byrner8,2008-03-02T13:30Z,"I had the same problems but just do theses steps and it works:
1:Download game
2:Unrar using winrar
3:Install the game by mounting the ISO with daemons tools 
4:go here:http://m0004.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_rock_manager.shtml
Download the crack and unrar
5:Replace the RockManager.exe with the new one
6:Play and think of me XD"
,Byrner8,2008-03-03T13:40Z,"Also if you still think it has a virus just after you unrar the files delete everything except the RockMan.iso and you wont get virus warnings like i did,When i kept getting warnings i just turned off AVG.
The game is very good its a bit short though i completed in about 4 hour but its still good fun."
,ShadeXo,2008-03-26T12:25Z,I can't find the iso to mount....help please

,ilovemyanniepie_tom,2009-06-20T20:33Z,"For the record, there are at least two trojans in this. I know because avast spazzed out and cried a bit as soon as it finished downloading.

From what I can tell, it's nothing too terrible. 
Nice try, though."
,ilovemyanniepie_tom,2009-06-20T21:59Z,"... Okay, I'm an idiot. I read closely, and laughed."
