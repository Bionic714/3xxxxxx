:. about .:

Rock Manager from DreamCatcher Interactive is actually a surprisingly clever
and enjoyable little game.

Rock Manager is a simple strategy game in which you manage different rock 
groups in nine different missions. 

You?ll have to assemble a band, get a contract, license an album, sell lots of 
copies, get good press reviews, and go on world tour. 

it comes up with good music and spirited voice acting that give the game a lot 
of personality.

Much of the game?s voice work is delivered by British actors (some of whom try
to sound like Americans), and it?s mostly very convincing, very enthusiastic, and
very profane. Your smiling, gumby-esque musicians will curse profusely when 
they?re upset at a bad gig, use expletives to describe how pleased they are about 
their album?s success, and swear casually, even when they?re just making 
conversation.Rock Manager?s voice acting may surprise you the first time around,
though you?ll probably find it suits the game quite well. The game actually has at
least a few different voice samples for each character in each situation?which,
along with the voice work?s generally high quality, makes sure that these samples 
don?t get repetitive, at least for a while.
