Please reply "
,Mr.kc3000,2007-07-23T01:08Z,get divx codecs or vlc player
,goblind69,2007-07-24T02:11Z,for those that are new to this game...download the program called convertxtodvd...this program will convert the movie file into a file format you can burn to dvd...the program also gives you a choice to burn with this program or save it to burn with another...i use convertxtodvd for both converting and for burning...note this process takes about 3.5 hours though so be patient
,Fedjeviking,2007-07-30T21:20Z,"Great torrent! Good advice for noobs on the convertxtodvd, thanks--got it the first time!"
