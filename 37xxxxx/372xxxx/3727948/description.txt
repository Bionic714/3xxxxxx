John Harrison's score to the 1985 film "Day of the Dead," the third of George Romero's zombie films.  Finally released on CD in a limited edition run of 3000. 

The first track is probably the best - a twenty minute selection of music from the entire film, entitled "The Dead Suite," which includes the entire underscoring of the movie's opening sequence.  Tracks 7 through 11 are essentially a rehashing of the earlier tracks, but with added sound effects of shuffling footsteps, zombies groaning, bones breaking, and flesh tearing.  And tracks 5 and 6 are good for a laugh, too - typical 1980's pop movie songs with heavy handed lyrics and lots of electric guitar.
