Go ahead and laugh at the title of this book, but admit it--do you know what a cytomegalovirus is, or how to get rid of one? (It's a little-known sexually-transmitted disease, and there's no known cure.) Dr. Ruth Westheimer has written a valuable reference for those who think they know it all--and for those who admit they know nothing. Westheimer covers male and female anatomy, masturbation, birth control, and the ups and downs of orgasms, along with many other very sensitive subjects--such as how to come out when you're married and have children. For parents who are having trouble talking with their teens about sex, this book could break the ice. It's especially worthy reading--for young and old alike--for Westheimer's candid discussions of the often-ignored emotional and psychological aspects of sexuality, from the effects of losing one's virginity to having cybersex to handling premature ejaculation and other sexual problems.
