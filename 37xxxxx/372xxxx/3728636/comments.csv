,lilwoodenboy,2007-07-01T01:36Z,"NICE.  just checked it at 84% on VLC and this is FOR REAL.  its not DVD at all.. yet its very watchable! English Audio. 

THANKS are in order!"
,~,2007-07-01T07:15Z,Very nice!  Thx!!! 
,bigburkett,2007-07-01T21:35Z,"I don't ussually comment on the poor quality because its free, but this is really shitty quality. I appreciate the download and all, but atleast tell people that they should expect a ""book on tape"" experience when its this bad. You can hear it, but you just can't watch it. Again, I appreciate the effort. If you have to see this right now, then this is the download for you. If you can wait for a better rip, I would.
Here is an honest rating.
Video 3/10
sound 7/10"
,flashmomentum,2007-07-01T23:15Z,"bigburkett this is not a DVD rip.  The DVD is not out yet.

This is a cam.  As far as cams go it is not bad.  But compared to a DVD rip it is not nearly as good."
,ecRUDEpunk,2007-07-02T03:22Z,"jesus...I would it kill you to at least add a little ""thank you for uploading"" to your complaints? I mean...wutever"
,lilwoodenboy,2007-07-02T18:50Z,Ill repeat.. this CAM is totally watchable .. if some dork cant see it properly .. ADJUST YOUR monitor/OVERLAY profiles. JEESH! cams always require a different profile to look better!
