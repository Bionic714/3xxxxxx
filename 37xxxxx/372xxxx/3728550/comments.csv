I'll be back at the end of July and will start seeding everything again then - and of course will have a new mixtape ready too. 

Happy listening."
,Merdre,2007-06-30T13:07Z,Always a pleasure to find a new mixtape from you! Thanks!
,thespecialone,2007-06-30T16:29Z,"Merdre - you are quick! Do you live on Pirate Bay :)

,Keaneolle,2007-07-01T20:48Z,"Thx Shankly for this mix, I wish you a nice holiday and welcome back soon for an chart of July music. 

Kind Regards Keaneolle"
,klant_apa,2007-07-01T21:44Z,"Ah! Thanks for this, as always an interesting mix. But I think you have missed the number one song in June, Moneybrother with ""Just Another Summer"". ..

Anyway, keep up the good work!
Cheers!"
[T],Shanklys Love Child,2007-07-02T03:15Z,"Thanks for all the comments. Good to know you are still listening :)

Haven't heard the Moneybrother track and will check it out!"
,arthurofboro,2007-07-04T10:56Z,"Thanks again Shankly. Thats the first half of the year done so will try to get some art done soon.

klant_apa I hope you were joking about that Moneybrother with ""Just Another Summer. If thats the best we have had a bad June and I dont just mean the weather."

,arthurofboro,2007-07-05T10:08Z,"Can any one post here and tell me how to send a Private message on TPB. You used to be able to do it but now I can't find where it is.

Any help appreciated."
,freshearth,2007-07-07T19:09Z,"Just started listening to this and loving it, esp the Melt Banana, Shellac, Crimea tracks. This is my introduction to your mix tapes, def gonna check out the others as well. Thanks Shankly! "
,Iddiz,2007-07-09T18:26Z,"I started listening to your mixtapes, and i'm just amazed and hooked on it ;D... great music indeed .. keep brining 'em... =) GJ!"
,rahiim,2007-08-01T21:44Z,"Are these compiled by ""Shanklys Love Child"", or someone called Shankly? Is there a web site? Where can I find out more? "
,rahiim,2007-08-01T22:13Z,"I love this. Wish he would adhere to the Musicbrainz tag guidelines, though. 
Easy retagging with Amarok: Drag 01xx tracks into playlist, select all, edit tags, set album number to 1, save. Edit tags again, File name schemes, set scheme to 01%track, alt-f and alt-n until all tracks are tagged. Repeat whole procedure for disc 2 and 3. 
Oh, and I also tagged the whole thing's album name as ""Shankly's best of June 2007"". Yes, quite pedantic, but I care :)
Now, if someone would make a cover for the mix album... :)"

I made it for those so far this year and all of last years but last years is dead now.
Called Shankly's Mix Tapes as thats how they were originally named on last years collection when I first discovered them Kinda like that title anyway"
[T],Shanklys Love Child,2007-08-02T15:15Z,"Am back off holiday and will get a July mixtape up soon. 

Thanks for all the comments and feedback - and to Arthur for the excellent artwork (again)!!!"
