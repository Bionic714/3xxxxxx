,dingbatty,2007-06-27T05:15Z,Pornography doesn't belong in this section.
,drayke,2007-06-27T05:37Z,It's not pornography.  Manga does not = hentai. 
,dingbatty,2007-06-28T09:43Z,No duh.  But a lot of horror or scat manga (ero guro) are also pornographic in nature.
,drayke,2007-06-28T16:33Z,A quick browse through the other files in this section seems to imply that as long as it's a comic it belongs in this section.  And the closest to pornography in any of this is tit shots in Tomie and there's few to none of them.

Although that's mostly overflow of the Ito Junji love."
