,medusa1147,2007-07-03T14:08Z,"Excellent!  I was going to make the DVD but it would take quite a while on this MacBook using iDVD.  I'm planning to distribute as many copies as I can burn, and I suggest everyone else do the same!!"
,stardude,2007-07-04T00:25Z,"probably one of the most important documentaries EVER.

thnx kongdv."
,Da Blues Mon,2007-07-06T02:50Z,Good video & audio.  EVERYONE should see this one! ...  at least once.
,drerock,2007-07-14T21:52Z,"Great torrent kong.

I am trying to burn this to a dvd so it will play in any normal dvd player. I have tried burning the files straight to a disc, after reading that a dvd with the correct folder structure should work; but it didn't. Could you or anyone reading this give me information on burning this to a dvd?

Just burn the VIDEO_TS folder with contents to disc. The DVD player looks in the VIDEO_TS folder, that's where all the video files should be."
,Osaka,2007-07-23T11:33Z,"Here's the real original DVD http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3750008/

The difference is that torrent is not a converted .avi file downloaded off Google Video -- it's the actual original DVD.

I've just begun to download it right now..."
,PerfectTool,2007-08-19T00:59Z,"quite honestly.. this is old news if you have been paying attention. but on the other hand, it's great for everybody that the truth comes out in a more commercial scale. please make an effort to distibute this movie."
,retkikunta,2007-09-11T12:30Z,"i just found out about this shit. I wathced the DVDrip and it turned my stomach out. For the most fearing part of all this is that there is a reference in a bible to all this too (Verichip and where it is taking us), in the apocalypse.

Please, remember people that the bible might not be the conspiracy on it's own. It could be just us, people in the power who uses it for their own cruel interests. The teachings in all our religions is still good, i think. What difference it makes are they only stories of a story.

At least i'm convinced of the truthfull of this movie. Watch it, judge after that. And use your own head. For now on, i will do my best to spread the word.

Evil must not prevail, for all our sakes."
,Sneuf,2007-11-10T05:52Z,I just started downloading and i  plan to seed for 100GB when i've finished so all those who download please do so also.  this is a movie everone should see and spread.

,YonderAnt,2008-02-10T19:28Z,does it include an english subtitle? thanks.
,shellnet,2008-03-09T01:06Z,I paused all other torrents for the time being.  I will seed this with no upload limit until I'm at 10.0
,shellnet,2008-03-11T00:17Z,"Wow, what a difference a T-1 makes.  Averaging 85KB on the upload and hit 120.something earlier.  You actually CAN get what you pay for, in business at least :(  

Fuck Comcast!"
,Claus-,2008-03-26T07:01Z,"Great film.
Would be nice to see some intelligent criticism about these kinds of movies that try to show us how narrow view of things the mass media offers and that we don't think for ourselves nearly enough..
""This film doesn't give you the absolute truth about things so it is all *curses*"". That kind of ""logic"" is all too common with people critisizing these kinds of movies. 
I understand why it must feel awful for some media workers, these kinds of movies do their real job. They try to fix the lack of important ideas and information what the mass media should'v published a long time ago.
Of course we should debate about things, but we should also get the chance to do so. We need to hear more information about important things, from different points of view, but the general public is being denied from that opportunity."
,firstsoundent,2008-05-28T00:18Z,Thanks for the Up. The world should see this right after watching the left behind series ;-)
,rajivuncoiling,2008-06-28T10:24Z,"one of the best researched documentary even produced. i personally think that part I was not required its useless to hurt anybody's religious sentiments regardless to his/her caste color and creed. even if what they say in part I is 100%, which i doubt, what matters in religion is faith not history. rest of the movie is no doubt an eye opener for all people those who think they are rewarded for their hard work and honesty, in fact there are criminal and swindlers with trillion of dollars to swindle any single penny they can get from you. MUST WATCH AND DISTRIBUTE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ALL. may god bless you all, regardless to your caste, color and creed."
