Description:
Description: From Yesasia :
The supporting cast of Kung Fu Hustle returns in Kung Fu Fighter, in which Vanness Wu of JVKV (formerly known as F4) demonstrates some hardboiled action scenes. Lam Chi Chung, Tin Kai Man, Chan Kwok Kwan, and Bruce Leung, Stephen Chow's collaborators in Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle, join forces with famous action star Terry Fan Siu Wong and singer/actress Emme Wong, who recently appeared in Confession of Pain. While a sequel to the Kung Fu Hustle is yet to be produced, fans of the action comedy genre may wish to watch King Fu Fighter, which has a similar setting and just-as-stunning action sequences!

Ma (Vanness Wu) is a young man searching for his kung fu expert father in 1930s Shanghai. Inheriting his father's super strength, he secures a job at a martial arts house and befriends Fat (Lam Chi Chung). The two fall into a trap and the Shanghai triads want to hunt them down. Meanwhile, Ma also has a crush on singer Lung (Emme Wong), but will the love between them blossom? With so many different parties plotting against each other, will Ma survive all the conspiracies?
