THE STORY:

Hulk is coming and no power on Earth can stop him from getting revenge on the
Illuminati! What events have led up to the super-human battle-to-end-all-battles?
As Hulk's great stone ship approaches the planet, he prepares for the war on the
horizon by reliving past conflicts with Iron Man, The Fantastic Four, Doctor Strange
and the Inhumans. This is the perfect jumping-on point for this summer's super
hero-smashing, city-leveling, bone-crushing, Marvel history-making event!
