
This is my 4th Trance Classic megamix. As the rest of the critics, the critic is at most very good. And I'ts really nice to get feedback of the work. So as I said in all other of my NFO's I DONT CARE IF YOU DONT LIKE THIS. 
If you like it however, im glad. 
Been trying to cencentrate to keep the quality up both regarding the music and the source quality. So in stead of filling the mix over one hour long, I've "filtered" the best material out for this mix. Hope you like it.
