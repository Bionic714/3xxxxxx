Ok, as you all know I'm a very patient Demonoid uploader. I vowed to only upload to Demonoid, but because I'm so patient, 2 days after I realized the site is down I've had a complete mental breakdown and am breaking my vow to Demonoid, and shall now release to many other sites. So yeah, here's Moral Orel Season 1. For those of you who don't know me, these are iPod Videos, the highest quality possible. They look beautiful on my iPod, 20" iMac, and Plasma HDTV.

The resolution differs on some files but most are 640x480. I will upload Season 2 when the last 3 episodes air. Go to IMDB to find out what the show is about, and I do recommend this show as it's one of the funniest shows EVER.

So yeah, that's pretty much it. Remember, if you don't seed God will kill you. Seeding makes the world go round.


Oh yeah, one more thing. If you want to request something, email me at heymbit@gmail.com, my account Heymbit (at both demonoid and darkside) or PM me at Heymbit (AIM)

If you try to make a request anywhere else, including comments in my own torrents, I will ignore them and add you to my meany list.
