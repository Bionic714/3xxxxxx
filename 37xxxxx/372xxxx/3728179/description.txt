West Virginia Greg - DVD!!!



WV Greg is a back-yard spoof of "Indiana Jones" and was shot in 1993 with no budget, 

no talent, no skill... It's 25 minutes of ridiculous banter and ignorance, including

ninjas, sumos, cowboys, and of course...The Ark of The Covenant.



Just burn the VOB files onto a standard DVD and enjoy... or not.



Congratulations, rhubarb!
