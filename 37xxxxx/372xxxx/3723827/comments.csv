Because he wanted to BREAK ON THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE!"

,iain88,2008-04-21T16:24Z,somebody please confirm the presence or lack of viruses! If Sandmanto's security is picking up trojan horses then we need to warn people
,iain88,2008-04-22T14:57Z,Ok i scanned with a current version of AVG free. No viruses. :) Could a norton user post too just to be sure? We don't want people to be discouraged from downloading this superb album.

,alias_decker,2008-05-16T23:47Z,"some antivirus programs apparentlt reacted to the .info file. a little tip for the azureus users: to open a .torrent file, don't just double click it. instead go to file > open> torrent file. that way you can see what you will get, and since the avarage virus/trojan doesn't hide in an .mp3 file, its ok to download them. for example i never want the album cover, so i simply unckeck that file.  BTW ALL UTORRENT/BITTORRENT/BITCOMET USERS, I HIGHLY RECOMMENS AZUREUS CINCE IT IS FASTER, EASIER TO SET UP AND SAFER!!!  ow and limewire is really out of question."
