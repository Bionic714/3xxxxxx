The Doors were an American rock band formed in 1965 in Los Angeles by keyboardist Ray Manzarek, vocalist Jim Morrison, drummer John Densmore, and guitarist Robby Krieger. They were one of the most controversial bands of their time, due mostly to Morrison's cryptic lyrics and unpredictable stage persona. Since the band's dissolution in the early 1970s - and especially since Morrison's death in 1971 - interest in the Doors' music has remained high, at times even surpassing that which the band enjoyed during its own lifetime.[citation needed] The Doors have sold over 50 million albums worldwide.
