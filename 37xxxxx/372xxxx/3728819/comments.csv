,HoogeveenseRAT,2007-10-26T20:29Z,"Thanks for sharing mate :). But it doesn't work for me? These are the things I did:

1 - I did a complete uninstall of Studio 11
2 - I rebooted my PC
3 - I downloaded and installed de Pinnacle Registry Remover
4 - I ran the Registry Remover, but it didn't help.
5 - I rebooted my PC
6 - I want to install the software again, but at the point where it asks for the serial number during the installation, the entries for the serial number are already filled. :( what did I wrong?

Thanks in advance :)"
