,blkwlf,2007-07-09T06:00Z,anyone have his first book this one is good
,dirtydata,2008-01-12T19:10Z,"Simply put, every American should read this book even if they don't support Obama."
,jasonbir,2008-01-14T07:53Z,"yeah im canadian but i still had to listen to this audiobook, really hope that a *relatively* young, black man gets elected president, somebody that i can relate to more than old white people."
,sanniefight,2008-02-11T17:19Z,"Love this book thanks!

,Mellow26,2008-02-17T18:17Z,"shoeshoe, come back in a few years when you have grown up.  I'm so sick of having to read crap here from a-holes like you!"
,shoeshoe,2008-02-18T00:16Z,"Mellow26, stop being mean! I was asking a simple question!"
,leonard_caulings,2008-02-20T09:19Z,"No, shoeshoe.  You were just looking for attention.

We all know what crap smells like.  That's exactly why Barack Obama is gaining momentum and interest.  We're all looking for some fresh air in a polluted political wasteland."
,nyptv,2008-02-21T08:17Z,"This is why i love the bay. no censorship. even when the majority agrees that shoeshoe should be censored.

Obama has given me hope. Thats more than I have gotten from bush, and more than mccain could ever hope to deliver, and whatever her name is does not matter. She can't answer a straight question, and it's painful to hear her speak. Just another WASHING MACHINE."
,rumplestilts,2008-02-22T05:42Z,"Thanks for the e-book (a-book? :D ).

Go Obama!"
,leonard_caulings,2008-02-23T06:08Z,"""Obama is just another corporate whore funded by the dollars of the people who will benefit from him being in power.""

Care to back up your statement with at least one fact, shoeshoe?  I, and the rest of the nation, would love to be properly informed.  I bet you could even help the Clinton campaign significantly by producing such evidence since Obama claims to have not taken a penny from any corporate lobbyist.  Please, enlighten us.

Or, perhaps you are just another nasty little pessimist sucking off of the teat of society's woes.  Let's find out, shall we?"
,fred426,2008-02-23T19:19Z,I hear Obama is better at sucking dick . There is news out Michelle Obama and Bill O'Reilly where seen going into a motel together followed by Chris Matthews and Barrack was there to take pictures and he was quoted as saying it all about change. He then yelled switch and him and Chris Matthews 69nd each other. 
,zitroz,2008-03-20T23:58Z,This the most important book I have listen to in a long time.

,daoistic,2008-04-08T04:24Z,That website is a total frame job only idiots actually accept.  It says various corporations do immoral things and then attempts to mildly connect obama. It is like saying I am responsible for the actions of the people of the apartment building I live in. 
,davesys,2008-04-14T20:31Z,"you know. america is a sick country right now. you americans will have to face the fact. people really do not like your country. although there are very nice people in that country. but your leadership is wrong about they way it handles things in the world. the palestinian isreali issue, iraq, double standards and all. obama seems like he truly understand the problem and is willing to do something about it. in africa here, america is not popular at all with the youth. i think if you are strong and you are trying to bully everyone, you are weak.. and that's what america seems to be doing now. i think you guys should hold your leaders accountable. vote obama. in my opinion, he is the best of the three."
,East Lansing,2008-06-27T18:54Z,"I love Barack, but this book is soooo boring I couldn't stand to listen to the whole thing.  Torrent sound quality is fine though."
,dustypie,2008-06-29T17:35Z,"hate to get in on this but honestly!  Calling someone a communist because they don't agree with you is absurd.  I am supporting Ralph Nader 100%.  I know that he won't win but I would rather support someone that is intelligent provides something more than ""hope.""  He provides answers and his record shows it."
,darabon,2008-07-13T07:54Z,"derrida, I just listening to the book and you are missing two chapters from the book:

Chapter 8: The World Beyond Our Borders

Epilogue 

Can you upload those two chapters?

I would really appreciate it.

Thanks "
,mirage2007,2008-08-04T21:02Z,"Obama's grotesque Uriah Heap routine in front of AIPAC would indicate that Shoeshoe is right. He debased himself for mpney and ruined his credibility, as well as his political options. What a shame!"
,Reservoir69,2008-08-05T14:37Z,"Since the comments on this board have all turned political, I will jump in.  This week the DEMOCRATIC congress is taking a 5 week vacation while the country is in a BIG fuel problem.  Obama has just flip flopped his oil drilling policies, and he has just played the race card.  Where is the landslide lead Obama should have in this political race?  There isn't one because smart people are starting to understand fixing this country is going to take more than a flip-flopping, loud mouth ""rock star"". "
,texasrangers,2008-08-28T18:10Z,"to whoever is calling obama a communist and objects to him, i don't care who you are, you are ALL communist for torrenting."
,Reservoir69,2008-08-30T06:02Z,"The only CHANGE you will see is higher taxes.  Communism is when the government owns everything like health care, what Barrack proposes to do (big mistake, think of HMOs only 100 times worse).  

Torrenting is sharing information and ideas, just the opposite of communism.  Texasranger, keep your 10 year old wisdom to yourself."
,AAngelraf,2008-09-15T03:03Z,"
i find it funny that people try to express political views here.

this is a backroom shithole in the dive-bar that is the internet. 

no one's opinions here matter.

 no one who matters will ever read anything that is written here.'


 this is a place for pirates, pervert, thieves and dirtbags.

I am proudly all of the above.

why, in gods name, would these reprobates think that this is the place to make a political stand.

,Polysaturatedfat,2008-09-17T21:25Z,"Does anyone know where I can get a PDF of this?

Or PDF's of other books for that matter? All I ever find are text books or technical books in PDF form."
,lancedass,2008-11-16T00:39Z,"to leonard_caulings and all the other obamatologists:

not only is obama a whore (see the brilliant analysis of paul street for more details or just check opensecrets.org for l. ron obama's top donors), but this book is basically his version of standing on the corner of wall street offering the ruling class a cleveland steamer. too bad those of us outside the top 1% are the ones getting shit on. 

just because you refuse to look for information doesn't mean it's nonexistent, so quit acting like the neocons that bashed F9/11 without even watching it. "
,vulcanpirate,2008-11-28T09:57Z,"please guys dont fight.... it just makes us look like stupid americans.... noone has seen a succesful example of communism... and no i dont think that obama can or plans to do that... but he has inspired america's people to think beyond their four walls, inspiring those who can to help those who cant... now download this and a beyonce album and cheer the fuck up!!!"
[T],CaptOmerta,2008-11-28T11:13Z,"AAngelraf has a great comment.

Everything Obama says he will do the opposite, just like all the latest ones do. 
No new taxes..
I didn't Inhale...
I'm not a Crook....
I didn't have sexual relations with that girl...
We know he is hiding weapons of MD....

Who actually listens to these puppets anyway?"
,mcbozburger,2009-01-04T03:44Z,"Nice work commenting on the torrent guys. Real nice work.

Noone on this site gives a shit about your political beliefs, or views, so if your not gonna commment on the torrent, don't comment atall.

There's a -4 rating because of people who won't ever give President Obama a chance at anything. 

For those willing to listen, this is an excellent introduction to him, his thoughts and views--all developed from that very foundation that makes progress possible: common sense."
