Barack Obama's first book, Dreams from My Father, was a              
compelling and moving memoir focusing on personal issues of          
race, identity, and community. With his second book The              
Audacity of Hope, Obama engages themes raised in his keynote         
speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, shares            
personal views on faith and values and offers a vision of            
the future that involves repairing a "political process that         
is broken" and restoring a government that has fallen out of         
touch with the people. We had the opportunity to ask Senator         
Obama a few questions about writing, reading, and politics
