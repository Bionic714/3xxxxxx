fast downlading so far"
,evilg0d,2012-04-13T17:23Z,I loved this game the first time I played it years ago but it refuses to install on Window 7 x64. Setup.exe does nothing and using compatibility mode appears to change nothing. If anybody has any ideas they would be appreciated. I'll check back later. Thanks in advance.
,evilg0d,2012-04-15T17:26Z,Please ignore my previous comment as I have since downloaded it again from a different source and I still have the same issue so it must just be my PC. Sorry torrentscwb.
