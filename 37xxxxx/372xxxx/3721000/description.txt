         ?  of extra drums and cymbals. The samples include every  ?
         ?  nuance  from  the  softest  to the hardest hits, many  ?
         ?  stroke variations (hihat has 12 variations, snare has  ?
         ?  6  for example) Alternating samples through-out bring  ?
         ?  unparalleled realism.                                  ?

         ?  All  sampled  drum/cymbal  sounds are recorded with a  ?
         ?  multi  channel  mic setup, just as you would record a  ?
         ?  real drum kit.                                         ?
