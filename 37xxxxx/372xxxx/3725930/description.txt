So you all know the story about that guy and his talking car.. and you all probably have seen Mr. Hairy chest running down the beach so many times, and blah blah we all know someone?s been looking for freedom. SO WHAT?S NEW?! We are! We are HASSELHOFF; a next generation fuelled by all the great sounds of the 80?s and the finest of now! Let The Hoff please your ears with some ?cock rockin? Nu Wave! For all of you who wet themselves with tunes from Duran Duran, Infadels, King, Miami Vice, Depeche Mode, Soulwax, Softcell, Don Johnson, Modern Talking, Blur, The Cult and so many more; this is the new swing, a brrrand new hype.. you?ve gotta kick this, before it get?s too hot!
