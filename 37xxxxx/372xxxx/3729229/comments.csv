,awiggin,2007-07-01T01:58Z,Just noticed that it isn't showing me as a seeder. How does the site figure this out anyway? Did I use the wrong addy for the tracker? I just copied the tracker info from my log file from another file I got from here. Maybe someone should put together a section to tell us what info to use when we create these torrents so that everything will work properly. Just a suggestion to help those of us who are using doing this for the first time ever.

This is just a portal for torrents.  If a few people read this you will be lucky.  I've got lots of great music, don't get me wrong.  Maybe ananomity is highest priority."
