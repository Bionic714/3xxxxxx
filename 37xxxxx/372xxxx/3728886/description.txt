The Ramones were an American band often regarded as the first punk rock group. After forming in Forest Hills, Queens, New York in 1974, they performed 2,263 concerts, touring virtually nonstop for 22 years.[4] In 1996, after a tour with the Lollapalooza music festival, the band went on a brief nightclub tour and then disbanded. Three of the band's four founding members?Joey Ramone, Johnny Ramone and Dee Dee Ramone?died within eight years after the breakup.

The Ramones never achieved much commercial success during their years of recording and performing. Their only album to reach certified gold status in the U.S. was their compilation album Ramones Mania.  Appreciation of the band has grown since the 1980s, and they now regularly appear on "all-time greatest" lists, such as Rolling Stone?s list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock and Mojo's 100 Greatest Albums. In 2002, the Ramones were voted the second greatest rock and roll band ever in Spin Magazine, trailing only The Beatles.[9] On March 2, 2002, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Formed in Forest Hills, NY, in 1974, this quartet of quintessential punk forefathers blitzkrieged out of NYC?s legendary CBGB scene and into world fame with three loud, lean, hard, and fast albums before the Sex Pistols even took their first shot. Besides basically inventing punk rock, Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee, and Tommy outlasted almost every one of their legions of followers, delivering their signature pop and garage-flavored chainsaw sound for over 20 years, through a string of infamous albums and 2,263 concerts together.

Spanning 1976-1995, this new collection features 20 classic tracks, including "Sheena Is A Punk Rocker," "Rockaway Beach," "Rock ?N? Roll High School," "I Wanna Be Sedated," "Pet Sematary," and "Blitzkrieg Bop."
