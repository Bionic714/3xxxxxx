,newsmaker,2007-06-27T03:47Z,"To falseprofit & killamuslim4fun... you guys obviously didn't even take the itme to watch the video becuase if you did you would see it is just archive news footage and expert analysis from physics professors, engineers & architects, as well as victims who share their stories of what they experienced.

Seems to me like you have no life and stay on here commenting on videos you haven't even watched."

Demonvoid, I believe that the person calling himself ""killamuslim4fun"" is now put on the TPB watchlist after his comments.

Something tells me that ""Muzlumkillah"" is on it too ;)"
,stardude,2007-06-27T20:30Z,"Demonvoid, sorry, he's calling himself ""killamuslim4funagain"" now after his ""killamuslim4fun"" TPB-account was cancelled by the admins."
,djob1,2008-03-13T07:48Z,Great video. Probably most down to earth and backed up video on how planes/fires couldn't have possibly brought down the three world trade center buildings. I lived in Manhattan at that time and remember still how all the news reports changed dramatically from the second day onwards.
