,twiddlebug,2009-12-20T23:45Z,"I have been able to play this with the DTS and without any problems under either of the following 2 conditions:

1. Using Spdifer (found on AC3Filter website) and letting surround sound be handled by my 5.1 receiver, OR

2. I re-authored the DVD using DVD Shrink, and merged all the VOBs into 1 File (I went a step further and made a VOB for Part I and a VOB for Part  II). Then instead of opening the DVD with the IFO file, I open the VOB instead in my media player and the DTS plays just fine.

For whatever reason, things go bad if you try to run it the 'normal' way or when opening the IFO. But I have confirmed the DTS plays fine under the two conditions above.

Hope this helps."
