,hetahumlan,2007-07-09T00:11Z,"Tack/Thx! Poor quality but really good for being a handheld movie, wait for the real one if your interested in the movie. Jag kommer ändå att vänta med att se filmen tills den kommer ut i dvd-kvalitet, denna är bra för att vara ""handhållen"" om man nu bara skall kolla för att ha sett den. "
