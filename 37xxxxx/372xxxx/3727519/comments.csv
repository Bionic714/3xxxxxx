If you took all of this stuff to heart you'd go crazy; so much underhanded crap going on. Some buziness & government officials do nothing else but figure out ways to be understanded. Come to thing of it, a lot of people, whether they're bums or have some high-level position anywhere doing anything spend a lot of mental energy formulating corrugated subterfuges with no other purpose but to mess with people, then they take a good amount of other energy justifying it, or paying someone else to figure a way of justifying it for them.
Maybe insects are truly a higher-order of consciousness. It's that we just don't know how to read them so we think they haven't one in the first instance. That works."
