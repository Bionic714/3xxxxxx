,Divowashere,2007-07-03T17:45Z,"Just don't remove the torrent from the list of downloaded ones, and it will say seeding.

Thanks a lot also to the one person who decided to seed lol.

I was sitting at 11% for a good day or two."
,inethero,2007-07-04T13:19Z,"For the love of God, can you dudes seed?
I am stuck at 88,2%!"
,PeaceyP,2007-07-04T23:36Z,"Ohman, I'm stuck on 82.8%, could someone please seed, I'm dying to try this shit out, it looks dope."
,Divowashere,2007-07-05T02:56Z,"If you're that far along, check your files and see if any of them are complete...

I've got the hardstyle completed, and I can use most of it in the plugin. Just make sure you're at version 1.3.0 at least or you'll be mildly annoyed when it doesn't work."
,xanxion,2007-07-05T07:20Z,"Im seeding now. With 15mbit upload connection.

Just remember seeding stuff. Dont just close after download finish, seed a little first.

Ciao! :)"
,Sexperimental,2007-07-05T14:20Z,Iam stuck at 82%. Wtf is this? SEED!
,Divowashere,2007-07-06T19:22Z,"Well, I think we're just tied to 82.8%"
,Divowashere,2007-07-06T23:27Z,"Whoa,

I just realized, we're all at 88.2% if I'm not mistaken, but you can still load the xpacks the only thing is a couple of the plugins won't work yet.

You can still use a good portion of them.

Just import them now, then when they're finished downloading, import them again."
,Stephano,2007-07-08T18:51Z,"When I've got this I'm gonna seed this for at least a week. But ""Divowashere"" have right...you can use alot of the sounds anyway. 
The dance drums expansion is a real kickass expansion pack. Damn it's good. Thanks"
,PeaceyP,2007-07-09T00:31Z,"Well, it's flying along now. (I love you seeders!!)

But my version of Nexus is at v1.0.9, from the Dynamics torrent I downloaded, how do I go about upgrading so that the expansions will work?

Do I just install the service packs from the reFX website?"
,djtippler,2007-07-09T23:36Z,"SEED PLEASE! WE'RE ALL STUCK ON 93,2%!"
,lignum_vitae,2007-07-09T23:45Z,"If you put on 1.0.9, I think that file comes with 1.1.0 as well, but if not, there is a torrent on here for the 1.1.0 patch.. then there is another torrent on here for 1.2.0 and 1.2.1 (nexus update pack) and then another torrent for 1.3.0 update."
,lignum_vitae,2007-07-10T06:29Z,"I installed 1.0.9, 1.1.0, 1.2.0, 1.2.1, and 1.3.0.. at 1.0.9 I didnt have a problem with the license, but after installing all these, now I have license issues.  Someone on the 1.3 torrent page said to add a line to a host file and delete the livecache dir, did that, still getting the license issue.. tried offline, still getting license issue.  I need for this to work so I can install them expansion packs and enjoy the product.  Also.. 11 downloads and 2 seeders... those other 9 suck.  and thanks a lot to the second seeder, 'cause now I'm at like 96% after sitting at 93.2 forever."
,johan_musik,2007-07-12T22:04Z,"tackar för denna har väntat på en reup på dessa... men nu har kommit nya expansion packs som jag väntar att få sätta tänderna i:D vore tacksam om nån kunde fixa upp dem med.

,artytorrent,2007-10-04T10:50Z,"To get the latest packs working once you've downloaded this, you need version 1.3 of the dll. Get it from http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3717762/ReFX.Nexus.v1.3.VSTi-AMPLiFY.rar

Remember that you can't run the program normally (without a few geeky tweaks) unless you are disconnected from the net."

,GodiaN,2008-01-02T06:24Z,"Ok I have a serious question, HOW IN THE HELL DO YOU INSTALL NEXUS INTO FL STUDIO? How do you open it up in FL STUDIO please help I'd love ya!"
,artytorrent,2008-01-12T21:19Z,"@Godian: Have you got the VSTi dll I linked to in a previous comment? It should install fine by extracting the RAR file and moving the dll into your usual VST folder. Nexus should then show up as an instrument in FL Studio if you refresh your list of plug-ins from that program. If you don't know how to install a plug-in or run a soft synth, then you really need to read the FL Studio help files.

,bryanacross,2008-02-04T09:23Z,"Why isn't anyone listing the new expansion packs? I've found stratosphere, it installs succesfully but shuts down whatever host program i'm using when I try to load a sound."

I've tried what it says but it keeps doing it. Some instruments work some don't, anyone know why?? 

Also when I first start nexus up from cubase it throws up this error message ""Couldn't find the content. Please locate the file '0TestTone.nxs' manually""

,DJMar,2008-10-09T11:16Z,"Why cant you guys just read the previous posts? All your questions are answered there. I cant get the hardstyle xp working either, too bad its corrupt. Becasue I create Hardstyel =)

To install the xp: Open up the plugin, there are som buttons you can press on Nexus: Here are the following buttons:

Library                freq
Mod                    mfx
Arp                     live 
TG                      SYS

See now? Easy as frikkin hell =) Press sys, imorpt XP and then you are done. Dont forget to follow the updates."
,ColdFission,2008-10-16T18:47Z,"Yeah, all the expansion packs work fine thanks to the DYNAMiCS unlock software to the presets going. But the hardstyle does not work; I am currently using 1.4.0 version of Nexus.

Anyway, nice upload you got here."
,driver76,2008-10-19T14:52Z,"ATT FOR ANYONE HAVING ISSUES. THERES A LOT OF CRAP ON THE MESSAGE BOARD HERE ABOUT THIS PLUGIN. READ THIS< AND YOU WILL HAVE A FULLY WORKING NEXUS..

The most important files you will need for a successfull install is the '0TestTone'. This file is crucial for operation because its the file that all patches reference to. Without it you will still get Nexus to work but it will give constant errors loading sounds and will constantly remind you it cannot find the testtone file.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS GO HERE

http://refx.com/?lang=en&page=products/nexus/downloads


Download the NEXUS CONTENT ONLY (which is actually pretty good) The '0TestTone' file is in there. WHne you have downloaded the 1.4gig of content just place it in your documents and settings folder, or where ever else you like. THEN download the 1.4 crack of Nexus from here and install. Launch your DAW/Sequencer and load nexus. At this point it will ask you where the '0TestTone' files is. It will be wherever you copied the 1.4 gig of content you downloaded and should be here inside the following folders>>>>

Presets - Nexus content -Samples - Rom - '0TestTone.nxs' CLICK THE FILE AND NEXUS SHOULDNT EVER ASK FOR THE FILES AGAIN UNLESS YOU DO A NEW INSTALL OR CHANGE THE LOCATION OF YOUR SAMPLES.


DO THAT, and I guarantee it will work.

EXPANSION PACKS: Just about all the ones here are corrupt but for the most part you will be able to use about 80% of all samples. I couldnt get the Piano and Hard style expansions to work regardless of what I did. Sample files can easily be corrupted so if you cant get some sounds or one or two expansion packs to work dont sweat it.

I must also say this is an excellent ROM sample player. Its rather inspiration and lets you get on with creating music rather than tweaking endless knobs.

I like this plugin so much that I will probably buy it when I can afford it. I actually do buy software I like so this is looking like a contender for a purchase. It may not seem it but I do support the software industry, I just do it on my terms.

Good Luck"
,coolflip,2008-10-31T17:17Z,"Uhh im not shure if it was this download or the 1.3 patch that i got, but one of them has a messed up virus where it deletes your windows login profile icon (to login), but you can still get in with ctrl+alt+delete"

OH MY GOD YOU GUYS!!!!!!!!
FKN READ THE POSTS FOR SOMEONES SAKES!!!!
ok? 


IF YOUR HAVING ALL THESE ERRORS, DO WHAT DRIVER76 SAID!
lol. 
The not enough space error will happen till you download the Nexus Demo Content from ReFX's site. 
Same with the whole locate 0testtone.nxs
Downloading the 0testtone.nxs torrent from here that I've seen mentioned WILL NOT help you. You must have all the content.

ALL THE HARDSTYLE HARD TRANCE PACKS IVE FOUND ON THE WEB WERE CORRUPT BECAUSE THEY ONLY WORK WITH THE OLD OLD NEXUS!

I finally found a working copy of it on some obscure torrent site. I have uploaded it, along with the 11 best Nexus expansions in my possession. If you want it, heres the link to my upload:
