                                 - RELEASE NOTES - 

     true next gen 
     
     NEXUS is a next generation rom synthesizer of highest quality that
     will make your dreams come true. Forget about the usual bread & butter
     ROM synthesizers whose sounds are boring, stale and lacking punch.
     
     NEXUS explores new territory and delivers complex, ultra-fat and
     up-to-date soundstorms that could not sound any better from the most
     expensive and best hardware - all at the tip of your fingers.
     
     NEXUS provides you with everything you need to create the new hit. Do
     you need the most powerful dance leadsounds to become famous in your
     club or a Gregorian choir to create the atmosphere of the next trance
     hit? Whatever you need, NEXUS will supply you with what you have
     always been longing for.
     
     Features like the freely programable arpeggiator, the versatile
     trancegate or the factory-library optimized for the most popular
     genres make this the best ROM synthesizer on the market.
     
     Even though the sound is first rate, your CPU is spared. You can
     expand NEXUS with new sounds by installing genre-specific expansion
     packs or customize the look of the GUI with our themed skins.
     
     Are you ready? You better be.

     * Over 4 gigabyte of previously unreleased sample material
