,punken_herzen,2007-09-04T19:13Z,I promise I'll seed for life. I wanna play tennis...
,johnnyjur,2007-09-19T23:33Z,Why won't this work? it goes out of the game when trying to play a match
,boagdon,2007-12-18T18:01Z,"IT DOESN'T WORK!
If I try to run the original VT3.exe - it tells me to insert the right CD. If I replace it with the VT3.exe crack, it gives me an error and doesn't start. The only thing that works is the VT3 configuration. Any idea how to make it work anyone?
Thanks"
,wolfhowler1,2008-04-19T16:00Z,"@boagdon
you have to put the crack in the game directory not use it as a shortcut"

If it does not help, check drivers for video card and DirectX version ...
Also check your computer configuration min.
My is:
Windows 7 Ultimate
AMD dual core 2.8MHz,
Nvidia PX9600GT 512 MB 256 bit
4MB RAM"
,the1mm,2010-03-27T14:45Z,"It doesn't work.

I copied the crack to the game dir and ran the game.

It shows a don't send error.

Please Help"
,the1mm,2010-03-27T16:07Z,"Sorry guys! The ""dont send"" error was because of low system 

requirements. For those who get a dont send error, just download

Swiftshader 2.01 from one of the following links and paste the included files

(Swiftshader.ini, d3d8.dll, d3d9.dll) into the game directory and play 

the game normally.

If you guys got any problem regarding Swiftshader just comment here."
