,sex_is_a_sport,2007-06-29T05:01Z,"Sorry dude.  I've been wantin' to post this for days now.  I've just been busy with work and all.  Thank God work doesn't affect Seeding 'eh (only as a saying, not religiously).  Anyway, i'll get the stats.  But yeah dude.......for future reference, if you're lookin' up what movies are posted under my name, they're all NTSC & whatever ur askin' about Audio & stuff like that............dude...........even I have no idea what ur ""technically"" lookin' for with that.  Are you talkin' like ur askin' if it's 5.1 Surround or somethin' like that?"

Alright, Soooooooo.....

STATS:  Spoken - English, French & Spanish
        Catptioned - English (For The Hearing Impaired)

p.s. - I just quoted that little hearing impaired thing cause it's what it's showing in the DVD Options when ya look in the Setup\Captions menu.

Cheers"
