[V],Subzero!,2007-06-29T17:38Z,lemmingNoids all over...
,Verwandlung-,2007-06-30T09:54Z,"thanks, does this work well in xp?"
,Verwandlung-,2007-06-30T09:55Z,"Nevermind, i found out it does!"
[V],Subzero!,2007-06-30T15:51Z,"hehe, well nice to see, verwandlung? aint that german language?
"
[V],Subzero!,2007-07-01T18:53Z,"nope, as long as you didnt have renamed the folder s , the methode you tried should work, you can go into the folder aswell clicking on ""LemmingsRevolution.exe"" , check that out!
"
[V],Subzero!,2007-07-02T01:25Z,"what sys specs do you have?...  probably there are not the correct avi codecs... because thats the he is starting, go to the folder and see if you can play the avi files, if they play, then it wont be codec related... anyways, iam outta ideas unless you post me what sys you have...."
[V],Subzero!,2007-07-03T03:27Z,"iam not sure, but it might be the dual core ,  as  i have exactly the same specs, just my computer is from packard bell and has amd 3200*64bit.... all the other specs are the same...!!!, well it might be Â´because the game doesnt work on dual core machine... ANY HELP FROM ANY OTHER LEECHER WOULD BE APPRECIATED!... lets wait a day or 2 may someone will help us here.... "
[V],Subzero!,2007-07-03T03:30Z,"other idea i got, is to change the compatibly mode when you press rightclick on the lemmings.exe file... try this and change to windows2000 compatible settings, this could help, i  hope so...."
[V],Subzero!,2007-07-04T03:13Z,"no problem, for you always you were friendly, and not like most others, btw. in case you solved this sooner or later, it would be nice to know how you did, a short mail on any of the latest torrents would be too nice, this information may can help me for sooner releases... thanks in advance, and happy gameing with the latest from me....!!! you ENJOY"
,BIade,2007-07-31T21:15Z,"I am having the same problem. But this time its on a real dual core machine, not HT lol.
Specs 
E6600 Core 2 Duo 2.4GHZ
GPU: EVGA Nvidia 8800GTS 320mb
Ram : 2gb G.SKILL DDR2 800 PC 6400 

When the game starts it quickly minimizes. If someone has found a solution for this please let me know."
[V],Subzero!,2007-08-03T19:53Z,"dont think this one is compatible with duocore system, think if yer system  has too much power the older games wont work, dunno, just an idea..."
,MP3-mans,2007-09-22T00:08Z,download over 870 times.... can anybody tell if this torrent actually works??  All I see are complaints...  thnks!
[V],Subzero!,2007-09-28T02:33Z,"it works, i have amd 3200+ 1,5 gigs ram, ati x600... hmmm.. just worked fine, i think the problem is that you freaks are havinh so called high end computers, were the older games are having problems... there are many old good games which wont run anymore on newer systems, weird , but reality!"
,painatal,2007-10-20T21:54Z,"I was having the same problem but after copying the directory to C:\Lemmings Revolution 3D\ it worked fine!

hope it works for you!"
,Doctec,2007-11-01T05:06Z,"to tell the truth ive never ever had a problem with ToeD's software and Dopemans!!!!!!!they are both awesome ppl for doin all this, you noobs just need to learn how to maintain ur PC's,install stuff and follow instructions properly, maybe click the reg file to add it....I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH ANY GAME from these guys and dont expect anything wrong with this game, maybe except the audio on vice city.........nevertheless.......thanks for doing such a great job!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,Doctec,2007-11-01T05:08Z,"oh and the trojan notification is because it thinks toed.exe is a virus for some stupid reason.thats because the one eyed dude has done ripping and scripting etc.......if you are too dumb to get it to work, go back to the library or go buy the game......."
,dastmo,2007-12-27T21:50Z,"Hey I don't know what you folks are thinking. But the fact if you have a dual core processer or your other specifics doesn't mean a damn thing... with xp just do as ""painatal"" wrote and it will work. Enjoy"
,aldrich86,2008-03-02T01:28Z,"Hi everyone!

I've downloaded this game and I had the same problem as nthorup...... But I figured out some way, heres how:

1. Unrar the archive
2. ""Right Click TOED.exe""
3. Run as ""administrator""

that's it!

just run the ""Lemmings Evolution.exe"" as an admin......

Hope it works to all....

By the way thank you so muxh TOED! all your uploads are great! Can I request a ripped game from you? That would be ""Microsoft Flight Simulator Deluxe""...

Thanks in advance..."
,the__end,2008-08-11T15:38Z,I have tried every thing. Play it on one core or 2 cores an older com with the exact rec for the game and I dont get it to work I have tried every thing its just going black and then it says that lemmings stoped working. and i have never had any problems with ToeD releaser exept for this one. but I will look some more for an working release.
,the__end,2008-08-11T16:43Z,"Im sry for my last comment. I love ToeD and I got it to work and on vista you need to extract it to C:\Lemmings Revolution 3D -(direct.play)- and right click and properties and click the scuare ""run as adminitrator"" on the .exe files then it works realy fine with the instructions Subzero! did put in the info on top. thx so mutch m8 I love ToeD  "
,LezDawson,2008-10-05T15:51Z,"Folks, this game works absolutely fine on a modern dual-core machine.

I found that in order to make it work I had to put the containing folder ANYWHERE on my main drive (in my case D-drive, but to most of you it will be C-drive).  It didn't work for me if I left it on my external hard drive.

Hope this helps!
:)"
,LezDawson,2008-10-05T15:54Z,"Last comment continued:

Oh yeah, and I don't have to 'run as administrator' or anything like that.  I just double-click the .dat file and it runs just fine.

:)"
,pukkalover,2009-01-16T15:50Z,"The game works doulble clicking the .bat file, but for me it has no sound?( also played second time round using the lemmings.exe)   The only sound I get is when i finish a level and the little movie plays.  tried all the compat options still no sound??  Also when the game loads, the menu wont display properly? I cant see the options its just black, I can click on them and the game starts. ???  Almost a goodie.... thanks anyway...oh im using vista home basic on an Acer amd sempron 2ghz 3500+  512mb"
,soadstas,2009-05-01T12:25Z,"""painatal"" you did the trick!!!!!!!"
,pu407nk,2009-09-06T06:24Z,"I had the problem too. I put it straight onto my main HD and it worked for me. 

Ex. C:\Lemmings Revolution 3D -(direct.play)-

Hope this helps."
,sconz33,2010-06-14T17:08Z,Great game but FUCK the mouse is super sensitive and there is no way to change it. Makes playing the game a pain in the ass. 
,mikinho8,2011-03-07T17:58Z,not work on my win 7 64 bit... :\
