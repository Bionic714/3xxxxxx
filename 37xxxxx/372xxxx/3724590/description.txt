Turning Thirty [Audiobook] 
by Mike Gayle Narrated by Jonathan Kerigan
Mike Gayle's previous novels My Legendary Girlfriend and
 Mr Commitment have already wittily chronicled living and loving 
among the twentysomethings at the end of the 20th century. As time
 marches on, Gayle's latest novel Turning Thirty deals with what 
happens when his characters reach that most dreaded of 
moments--the big three-o. Matt Beckford is reaching that
 time of life. At the age of 29 he thinks he has answered 
those two crucial questions you ask yourself as a teenager:
 "What am I going to do with my life?" and "Will I ever
 get a girlfriend?" Living as a computer expert in New
 York with the lovely Elaine, Matt thinks he's cracked
 life. But then both he and Elaine suddenly realise that 
their relationship isn't working. They split up amicably, 
realising that "biology is telling us there's no point in crying over 
spilt milk", and Matt heads back to his friends and parents in 
Birmingham. As his 30th birthday looms, Matt meets Ginny
 Pascoe, an old flame, or more accurately "a girl who was
 also a friend who I sometimes snogged", and things get more
 complicated as he realises that he's falling for Ginny--again.
 The transatlantic love triangle that develops between Matt, Ginny
 and Elaine is funny and refreshing, and lacks the usual angst you
 would expect from such a situation.
