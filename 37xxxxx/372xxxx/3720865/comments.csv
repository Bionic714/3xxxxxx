Umm, don't wanna complain really, but Mikey and Nicky -- while being a *great* film -- isn't by Cassavetes, he's just one of the stars. It's directed by Elaine May.

Anyway, these are all great movies, thanks for the upload. If you can edit the description, you might want to add a tag for FreakyFlicks (do a Pirate Bay search, you'll see what I mean). The people who look for the freakyflicks tag would really go for this torrent.

Yeah, I know about May but I never said she didn't direct. I think it's such an important film since it has John and Peter Falk and it has a JC feel about it.

I can't change the title AFAIK but since you mentioned Freak Flicks (just did it myself!) this'll appear in searches.

I'll add this link to those other Cassavetes too."

,actorsspace,2007-10-23T04:19Z,"I'm surprised about the comment about Love Streams, which is by far the better of these three. Mickey and Nicky is on DVD-- I got it from Netflix, if I remember correctly.

It should also be noted that the sync for Minnie and Moskowitz is way off between about half an hour in until at least where I am now, about an hour into it. The sound is at least a full second behind the correlating picture, which should be fixed if it can be done.

Otherwise, thanks so much for these! Awesome!"
,blrock69,2008-06-24T23:09Z,Thank you for these great films!
,derive,2008-09-09T14:26Z,terrific! (as cassavetes would say) true genius at work here. thank you very much.
