[V],Kuthumi,2007-06-27T19:24Z,"RubberTow uploaded the same film almost 20 hrs ago, then it was 1.15 Gigabytes, but he has not provided for any seeders yet. He has also uploaded qute a few other torrents since yesterday. Would be nice, though, to have a good copy of this original 1967 movie, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061391/"
,fedgeztan,2007-07-08T20:46Z,HEY upload a DVDR of this... 
,fedgeztan,2007-07-09T21:38Z,OK please upload the DVDR or DVD9... i would actually donate cash for that...
,fedgeztan,2007-07-18T05:08Z,anyone that uploads the dvdr will get 10.00usd from me.. pm to fedgeztan@hotmail.com
,RubberTow,2007-07-26T04:33Z,"I can do that. I'll upload the DVD soon:fedgeztan
And you can pay me $10 to rawise2@cfl.rr.com via Paypal. So you know that this is RUBrTOE, the r in my email stands for my first name: Robert. It's a play on the Spanish pronunciation: Roberto=Rubbertoe. I was born in Puerto Rico and my 10 year old aunt thought she heard the Spanish maid calling me Rubbertoe and the nickname stuck. The DVD I have is not original, it is ripped with DVD Shrink-is that good enough? "
,RubberTow,2007-07-26T04:36Z,And to the first commenter: I still have it on the hard drive seeding so what the F? You expect to get it from me alone in 20hrs? I got so many people uplading from me that none run at over 2 kbps so you'll just have to get the bulk of it from the swarm and get the missing pieces from me. That goes for any of the ones I rip and upload.
,fedgeztan,2007-08-20T18:05Z,upload dvd???
,RubberTow,2008-03-08T22:43Z,Why upload the dvd when this is just as good quality. get a divx player.
,RubberTow,2008-05-04T20:46Z,Torrent now available from RUBrTOE by request: Bluebeard on DVD 5 in ISO
,burningrabbit,2009-05-28T15:03Z,"Hey, cuz, can you upload ""Candy, the movie?"" It seems to conform to your tastes, and it is one good panty flick. Thanks for your attention to the details of the sex drive. burningrabbit."
