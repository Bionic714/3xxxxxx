,3bord3,2008-03-18T02:08Z,nordgrimm VLC is one of the most used players for videofiles on the net today. This is mostely becouse it dont need codecs and play allmost every video file out there.
,ANewDay2008,2008-04-20T04:46Z,"If this is an AVI, you can go to http://www.solveigmm.com/?Products&id=AVITrimmer and download their AVI Trimmer to remove the Spanish audio track.  It's freeware too!"
