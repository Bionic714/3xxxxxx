"
,GoggelTT,2007-07-16T15:28Z,There is no installation needed for new maps. Just copy the file to your SYSTEM\APPS\ROUTE66\MAPS folder.
,filipposd,2007-07-18T15:27Z,I have the Athens map but still do not start
,GoggelTT,2007-07-19T09:19Z,"Maybe the map is from an older version. I've downloades this torrent
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3497214/S60_Route_66_Mobile_7.0.989_Program___10_bonus_maps

I'm actually using the DACH map."
,grefven,2007-08-15T17:14Z,Doesn't work on Nokia 3250 :/ Crashes after start. Probably to little memory in this one.
,GoggelTT,2007-08-17T15:32Z,I'm using a Nokia 3250 too and it works correct.
,jaskaxx,2007-08-18T11:09Z,"do you need to copy ""system"" folder to memorycard? if you only install ""mobile7"" it will not work? there is already ""system"" folder in my memorycard, should I replace it? if I do, will it do some harm?"
,GoggelTT,2007-08-18T17:40Z,"First you have to copy the ""system"" folder to your memorycard. This folder is always on it. When you press ""replace"" only the content from the new folder will be replaced. You could also just copy the ""apps"" folder to your ""memorycard/system"" folder. Now you can install the ""mobile7.sis"". Have fun."
