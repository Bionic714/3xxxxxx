,Traxx2333,2008-04-16T14:03Z,Thanks Motstand90 Everything works perfectly. Even Played Multiplayer which is good. I had bought  my two disks in 2003 and had lost the 2nd disk do to because my Brother sat on it so now I am using the second disk. I had trouble all the time just using the 1st disk. It was very laggy just starting the game all the time. So when I installed the 2nd disk u offer it worked real good. I think it had to do with the extra graphics .exe that is on the disk. So thanks again. And to the rest of you. IF you follow the instructions on how to install this game then everything works. 5 Thumbs up from me.

My question is, it sounded like you were running this in linux from your comment.  What version/distro are you runnng and how did you get it to run.  I am running Ubuntu Intrepid and have read around for some ways to get it to run.  Wondering if this will run out of the box or if you need to do all that extra stuff?"

,Wolvie501,2011-05-02T19:04Z,"For people who dont know this is the original unreal tournament: It is, but its the GOTY edition. It has some extras and afaik is inmediatly patched up to 436 no delta. For those who want a no cd crack, there is non needed. But fi you do get that problem, here's a legit patch released by epic games them selfs that allows for play without the need for a CD: http://downloads.unrealadmin.org/UnrealTournament/Patches/Windows/utpatch436nodelta.exe

Great torrent, Old game, Clanned from 1999-03 winning cups on CB :3"
