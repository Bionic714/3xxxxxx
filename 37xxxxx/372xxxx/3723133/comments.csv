,bluegender,2007-06-25T03:35Z,"been waiting to get 1.4 so i could start a new game TY, great job as always"
,Deznaj,2007-06-25T18:35Z,"Dopeman, it's is fantastic to see you commitment. You stick with us through the dark times (getting Two Worlds to work is a dark time), by releasing the newest hacked patch.

I understand you went almost crazy due to the technical problems of this game (which are 100% the developers fault) and the people asking questions about it. Yet still you stay on the game. Respect to you Dopeman, and that is not something I easily give..."
,Ghyll,2007-06-25T18:51Z,"Question:  Why do we need a ""cracked"" patch for this game?  I downloaded a copy of it, applied the official patches, used the keygen, and it works fine.  What does this do?  More importantly, is there any way of opening up a pirated copy for online play?"
,420dopeman,2007-06-25T22:54Z,"Deznaj , thank you much. Spoken quite well and all very true at that, thanks...

Ghyll , the hacked pacthes are mostly for my 'english only' release of two-worlds, the users need the hacked patches to install for that version.. So that's what these are for.
Nothing in sight as far as cracked online play as of yet..."
[V],Subzero!,2007-06-27T00:51Z,"We had a system problem which will force us to restore everything from backup.
The disks are pretty much empty right now and until we are able to upload the backup and set up everything up, we have to close down.

We'll be back as soon as possible. Sorry for the inconvenience. lamenoid.cum"
,MK2K,2007-07-09T03:51Z,"Help!
I was playing nicely with the 1.1 version that do not need a genkey from a pirated cd that I bought. After upgrading to 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4, I started the game and was asked to enter serial number. Where do I get the serial number from? I search for setup.reg or regsetup.exe but none was found. If I need a keygen where can I download it? It isn't in the cd.

Thanks for the help."
,zakmaniac,2007-07-14T14:02Z,"BIG thx dopeman!
My hat is off to you! You not only delivered this great game but keep hacking its patches as well. Respect! "
,zacyoda,2007-07-19T23:44Z,"Does anyone know where you can get a trainer that works for the cracked game. None of the trainers I try work. Thanks for any help.

,Sneerk,2007-08-21T12:40Z,"Well the 1.5 Service Release is out, any chance we'll be seing it here soon?"
,kostolomach,2007-08-22T18:38Z,"great releases dopeman, thank you very much. but there is a problem... this patch 1.4 gives option to choose the graphic card you posses for better experience. i presume that you chose nvidia and now ati users have problems. can we somehow alter that option to suit us?"
,avp55,2007-08-23T21:38Z,is there any chance u are coing to release 1.5 patch soon??

,Necro-File,2009-08-27T04:43Z,"Why does the site say 9 seeds, when there's only 2 and neither of them are actively uploading (connected to 2 seeds, and 4 peers, but it's not downloading)?"
,Dezzo90p,2010-03-25T07:08Z,"If someone is able to seed for a little while, that would be great. Only need this Patch then i've got all of the ones required. Will of course seed some myself afterwards. Thanks."

,habashny,2012-01-29T20:40Z,"Please seed this, even if it's just for a short time. If I can't download this, I won't otherwise know how to get patches 1.4-1.6 properly since I've just been using dopeman's torrent and patches since the beginning. Thanks!!"
