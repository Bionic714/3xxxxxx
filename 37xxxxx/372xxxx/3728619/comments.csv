,Riverburn,2007-06-30T15:05Z,"thanks man, i already have point break synced...but i didn't like how it turned out so i haven't uploaded it, unfortunately i've deleted the movie and now i have to find it again. i'm not too interested in point break but i'll do it as a favour to you because of the glitter riff :)
Many thanks"
