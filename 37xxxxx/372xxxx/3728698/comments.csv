Seriously? Strange format? Have you ever looked at a DvD (Right clicked it, when it's in your drive, and then chosen open?)? It's just a simple DvD/movie structure, and many dvd creator/burner programs offer ""Burn DvD with Video Files"" - DvD Video Files are .ifo, .bup and .vob

(Please correct me if wrong :o)"
