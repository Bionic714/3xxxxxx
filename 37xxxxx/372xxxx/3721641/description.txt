  GAME NOTES:
  ~~~~~~~~~~	
  Leaner. Meaner. Greener. Well, maybe not leaner.
  
  Go beyond the film as you guide Shrek and all his pals on a thrilling,
  squad-based action-adventure. Voyage through familiar haunts like Shrek's
  swamp. Explore all-new areas like Far Far Away and even locations not seen
  in the film, like Billy Goat's Gruff Bridge, the Spooky Forest, and the
  Dwarven Mines.
  
  Get 3 of your friends together and watch the mayhem multiply. Choose 4
  characters from a list of 10, including Shrek and Princess Fiona, Donkey,
  Puss in Boots and Lil' Red, and everybody plays at once. Tag-team baddies
  and use each character's special abilities to solve puzzles and accomplish
  mission objectives. Switch among characters in the heat of battle. Laugh out
  loud as you and your pals are treated to hours of comic dialogue and sight
  gags.
  
  Experience Hero Time. Master each character's unique special moves in
  single-player segments and mini-quests that feature one character at a time.
  Then show off the skills you've perfected in the main game and start
  cleaning swamp!

  The adventure continues in Shrek 2.
