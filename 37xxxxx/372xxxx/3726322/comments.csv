But Jesus was a prophet that spread ""the word of God"" (lol) :D

BUT he did NOT do any wonders, DID NOT walk on water etc. etc. 
Lol :D"

(BTW: what is anarchy? xD)"
,chytraeus,2007-06-28T13:40Z,thank you for this. never mind what others say.
,renassault,2007-06-30T02:21Z,"Anarchy, when you study a little history offer a comment that is worth something. The fact that this religion existed within the generation of Jesus' death means that He existed."
