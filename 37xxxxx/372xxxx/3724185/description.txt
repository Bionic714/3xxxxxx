Main features

Oscillators

    * 3 x three stage- morphing main oscillators (main/slave, additional) per voice.
    * 1 extra sub oscillator.
    * Conventional analog waves + 64 additive waveforms.
    * Additive wave generator for user generated waveforms.
    * Frequency modulation, pulse width modulation, oscillator synchronization with all waveforms (all at same time possible).
    * Ring modulator and noise generator with adjustable noise color and amount.
    * Twice unison mode without reducing the polyphony.
    * Several poly, mono, legato and combination key modes.

Filters

    * 2(3) serial/parallel/split real time morphing analog modeling filters.
    * 4/3/2 pole low pass, high pass, band pass, band stop filters in any combination and relationship.
    * Filter resonance up to self oscillation.
    * Embedded polyphonic saturation and effect unit between filters with 8 different algorithms.

LFOs/Envelopes

    * 3 advanced shape morphing low frequency oscillators with tempo sync.
    * Each of the additive wave forms usable for LFOs.
    * 2 assignable envelopes with additional sustain rise/fall time feature.
    * Multiple assignable to the many modulation destinations.

Modulation Matrix

    * Advanced 9 stage modulation matrix with more than hundred assignable sources and destinations.
    * Each conceivable combination, cross wire and multiple assignment possible.
    * XGenerator for owner draw able modulation curves (only version 2).

Effects
