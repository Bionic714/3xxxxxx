the program can't start as it doesn't find something called ""fmodex.dll""?"
,dzconstantine,2007-09-12T13:41Z,"@ Shampiz

Theme hospital where released in 1997 I think :)"

Thanks!
for those you have problems just go to Hatred_Crack folder, copy the .exe file with the nice icon and paste it to C:/Program Files/Codemasters/Hospital Tycoon or whatever your install directory is..."
