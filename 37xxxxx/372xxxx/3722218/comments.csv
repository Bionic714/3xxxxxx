,sex_is_a_sport,2007-06-24T20:28Z,"It's NTSC.  With some of the programs ya burn the VOB files with, it wouldn't matter though.  Some of 'em will convert it over to whatever format ya want it in.

And yeah, the Subs, (from what's posted on the back of my DVD Case) are only available in Spanish for some reason."
