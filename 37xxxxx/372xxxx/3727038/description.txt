Laurence Rosenthal's score to the Greek mythology epic "Clash of the Titans."  Much beloved by fantasy film enthusiasts and admirers of Ray Harryhausen, this film has been considered the swan song of stop-motion animation.  Previously available only on vinyl or cassette during its initial run, and finally released on CD in the late 1990's.

Two different CD releases were made within the same year, and given identical catalog numbers; the second and later release featured three additional tracks not included in the first printing.  (One of these tracks, "Argos Destroyed," is music that isn't even used in the final cut of the movie.)  The track order is a bit confused, with music occuring later in the movie placed in the middle of the entire album.  This torrent contains the longer, 17-track release; both CD versions are now out of print.
