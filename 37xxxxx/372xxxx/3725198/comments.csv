,OzPhi,2008-06-02T09:27Z,"I downloaded a couple weeks ago with no problems, however I have been unable to install.  What file is needed to open this?  Any assistance greatly appreciated."
,Plisky,2008-07-09T11:54Z,"I had the same issue, i download and I am asked for a serial number. So I went to my Add/Remove programs and removed all previous MS office programs. I had a trail thing, and a Standard 2003 version. Once I removed both, all programs opened without any serial prompt. Hope that helps a few that are a little confused with this one. But yea, excellent torrent, easiest I've ever had."
