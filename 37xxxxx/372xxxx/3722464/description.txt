some consumers review :

This is the dress rehearsal for the Aloha From Hawaii televison special. Some people prefer it to the \"official\" Aloha concert, but the concerts aren\'t actually all that different from each other. Elvis seems slightly more relaxed here, maybe too relaxed, he forgets some of the verses of \"Burning Love\" and \"Steamroller Blues\". The main difference is that this concert has two less songs than the other one. This CD includes three of the five special \"insert\" songs recorded for the American broadcast (the remastered Aloha From Hawaii CD includes all five of them). The \"insert\" songs include false starts and between song conversations, where the director gives Elvis instructions and Elvis expresses his annoyance at having to record these songs at 3:00 in the morning. This is a nice CD to have, but the remastered Aloha from Hawaii CD has better sound quality. Of course, \"real\" Elvis fans will want to have both concerts.

Elvis Presley, 1973 Aloha From Hawaii television broadcastAloha from Hawaii is an Elvis Presley music concert broadcast live via satellite around the world on January 14, 1973.

The first-ever such performance to be broadcast live via satellite, Presley taped a January 12 rehearsal concert as a fail-safe in case anything went wrong with the satellite broadcast. For both shows, Presley was dressed in a white \"American Eagle\" jumpsuit designed by Gene Doucette.

Presley performed a vast array of old and recent hits like \"Steamroller Blues\", \"CC Rider\", \"Early Morning Rain\", \"Burning Love\", \"Blue Suede Shoes\", \"A Big Hunk o\' Love\", \"Suspicious Minds\", \"Can\'t Help Falling in Love.\" He showed his vocal range and strength with ballads like the Beatle\'s \"Something\", \"I\'m So Lonesome I Could Cry\", \"It\'s Over\", \"Welcome to my World\", \"I\'ll Remember You\" and \"What Now My Love\". The show is probably most remembered for his performance of the \"An American Trilogy\".

Directed by Marty Pasetta, the broadcast was a huge success: it was rumored to have reached an audience of more than one billion. In top vocal form, Presley was accompanied by:

James Burton (lead guitar) 
Glen Hardin (piano) 
Ronnie Tutt (drums) 
John Wilkinson (rhythm guitar) 
Jerry Scheff (bass) 
J.D. Sumner & the Stamps Quartet (backup vocals) 
Kathy Westmoreland (backup vocals) 
Charlie Hodge (harmony) 
Sweet Inspirations (backup vocals) 
Joe Guercio & his Orchestra
