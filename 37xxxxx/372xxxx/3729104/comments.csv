,prkchpsndwiches,2007-07-10T04:07Z,"WORKS ON WINDOWS MOBILE 2003 Version 4! Virus Free (Checked with AVG), Serials work so far."
,prkchpsndwiches,2007-07-10T04:19Z,EDIT Sbp Diary Works. Shell does not on WM4.  It will say something about an error with Windows CE but programs load and works on Axim x30.
,saiuk,2007-07-12T17:59Z,YES GUYS THE SERIALS ARE IN THE FOLDERS .. IV JUS INSTALLED IT TO MY SPV M700 WORKS FINE 
,foxmajik,2007-08-01T04:29Z,Packaging all of the files into a rar archive defeats the feature of bittorrent that allows you to choose which files you want to download.  Please package each application in a separate rar file for future releases.
