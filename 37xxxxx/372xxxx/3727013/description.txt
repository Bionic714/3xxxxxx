Soundtrack to the 1990 Barry Levinson movie "Avalon," music composed by Randy Newman.  Nominated for an Academy Award, Golden Globe, and Grammy - a delicate, beautiful score, featuring Newman at solo at the piano several times.

CD is stupidly out of print, but available at a decent price from some second-hand vendors.
