** THIS IS THE NTSC VERSION **
Make sure you have the right version for where you live!
   NTSC - North America
   PAL - (Most of) the rest of the world
** IF YOU GET THE WRONG VERSION, YOU WON\'T BE ABLE TO WATCH IT **


First of all, many thanks to UMe2 for the wonderful Mystery Science Theatre 3000 compilations in AVI format.

I don\'t like watching video on the computer screen, so I am transferring them to ordinary DVDs that can be played on an ordinary DVD player. The result was so nice I thought I\'d share.

This is Series 1, Episodes 1-3:
   1 - The Crawling Eye
   2 - The Robot vs the Aztec Mummy
   3 - Mad Monster

Yes, three full-length films on one ordinary DVD. With a front-end menu.

The picture quality has suffered a little after being converted to AVI and back again, but it is very watchable. This is an NTSC conversion of the PAL version which works fine. I have no way of testing the NTSC version, so let me know if it works!

I will seed for as long as I can, but I have limited hard drive space and can\'t always be online. So if you like it, please pick it up and seed it.

I am continuing to create these for my own use and will continue uploading them here if people want them.

HOW TO (for beginners):
1 - Use WinRAR to unzip the file. Inside will be two folders, AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS.
2 - Use the freeware program ImgBurn to \"build\" these folders into a DVD disk image.
3 - Use ImgBurn or your favourite burning program to burn onto a blank DVD.
