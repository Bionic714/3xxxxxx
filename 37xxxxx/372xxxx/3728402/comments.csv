The only thing  it's good for is as a classical example of one type of disinformation. If you really want to learn something about JFK assassination you need to download ""JFK II"""
,FinnOzy70,2007-08-03T11:36Z,Sorry. Perhaps I need to make myself more clear. It's disinformation because it's intended to confuse people.
,pops87pl,2007-08-26T19:01Z,"Yep it's shit... as FinnOzy70 said... watch ""JFK II"""
