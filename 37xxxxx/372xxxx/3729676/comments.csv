,kunghenke,2007-08-17T16:18Z,"These files do not seem to work, but maybe I am doing something wrong. 

Trying to mount the .ISO files with daemon tools, but it says that it cant open the files in kernel mode.

Also MagicISO is unable to open the .ISO files... 

Can anyone confirm that these files are ok?"

,d4zlia,2008-03-01T17:23Z,"Guys heres how to solve the whole ""how do i burn this"" and ""i cant play this once its burnt"" issue.

Firstly, open up each of the 2 ISO files using MagicISO and extract each fileinto a new folder so you end up with 2 folders........one for each iso.

Then (heres the important bit) just burn the contents (not the folders themselves) onto a CD using Nero.

YOU MUST CALL EACH DISK AS FOLLOWS OR IT WONT WORK

disk 1 = 3ds9_Ess_1
disk 2 = 3ds9_Ess_2

If you dont call them by those names it wont work becuase the projector (created using macromedia director) looks for the files on the CD and check the names :)

Problem solved.

I've waste 5 cd's to come to this conclusion so a thank you would be nice :) enjoy !"
