,GoldPirate,2007-12-23T03:41Z,please upload them classics
,Spurty,2008-03-21T20:20Z,Thanks. Cool cult classic. The quality of the encoding isn't great however. Aliasing is noticeable around edges. Anyone know what techniques to use to get the best ripping results?
,foziebear,2008-09-09T23:02Z,love the classics keep them coming
