,dorobou,2007-06-30T18:45Z,"I bought this game just because it was so rare. Im going to seed it practically forever, but i can't ensure you that my computer will be on all the time so please help me with the seeding. :P"
,Acid_drop,2007-09-04T08:25Z,"Thank you, but no audio, I searched around for a solution to no avail, can anyone here offer any insight?"
,Flanker15,2007-11-01T10:49Z,Will seed when finished!!
,Flanker15,2007-11-02T09:58Z,"Ok I got it in and will start the seed.
The basic game works flawlessly for me on XP but the addon seems to lack an installation program (it does have an autorun but without a setup it's no good) and just has a bunch of data files.  Putting these in the main games folder doesn't work so I don't know what to do with them."
,AhseZ,2007-12-31T17:46Z,"Got both DBTS and DBTS LFL original disk, wanted the game on my laptop (which lacks of a cdrom) , great game. I'll seed it for like forever too ;>"
,koppoken,2008-01-31T00:01Z,The installation just won't work for me. Seems like it won't work with XP after all
,fokzhound,2008-03-11T03:48Z,"thanks to all who are seeding, its downloading at a good rate. i'll seed for life when i get it cause its so rare. everyone should seed this because of its rarity. this is the only one i could find."
,XoOl,2008-07-08T02:33Z,"Has anyone gotten Limb from Limb to run?  It installs, the menu screen loads but when I load up a game I get a screen with a big shiny disk below ""Press alt-F4 to Quit"".  Cant find a fixed exe for it.  Any suggestions?"
,XoOl,2008-07-08T03:23Z,"Ok, nevermind that last comment, it works.... With the expansion.  Just did a reinstall.  Looks great with dgvoodoo at 1280x1024."
,Killmaim,2008-08-01T12:41Z,"once you have the dl, how do you install it?

help appreciated^^"
,b0b3r,2008-09-30T22:12Z,I'll seed this one :)
,elanesse,2008-10-25T14:06Z,"thnx.. super rare game... was good playing it again.. works almost perfectly... have some problems with menus, but that can just be me...

too all who has a problem installing: use Daemon tools.. worked perfectly for me."
,olle.bolle,2009-01-27T14:46Z,"i am happy that i finally found this nice game; i have been remembering it now and then for several years; i successfully installed it by sequentially mounting each .nrg image with Daemon tools, then opened the image disk drive to explore and navigate into Data folder where i launched setup.exe; the expansion pack did finish the install with error on it's exit but nevermind; then i copied the patch files from patch disk image to appropriate folder named ""data"", where the game installs; i must admit my expectations of memories were too high and i found the game itself dated alot; but i love to play odd and extremely old computer games from time to time; even ASCII rpg's ^p; so it's have some fun for me; good luck alles!"
,JimmyGonzo,2009-09-21T20:16Z,Mounted and installed the whole thing + patches. Everytime i try to run it it says that Windie.exe has stopped working. I've looked over the internet and i can't seem to find any solutions. Any help?
,PhoebosLC,2009-11-15T15:07Z,"Do not let this wither away. This is an unique game, which have not been successfully recreated to the present game. It's a great example of an action game done RIGHT, and I recommend it to everyone who want to play a good slash'em."
,Twistling,2010-01-22T19:49Z,"Anyone had problems with the color? Im using Windows 7, i'm guessing that's why the color is messed up. Please help or give tips of how to fix it.

,Gamejunkiez,2010-09-16T14:47Z,"- Install Die by the Sword.

- Install the addon Limb from Limb.

- Apply the DX9 patch by overwriting the files in the install dir.

- Mount Die by the Sword disk and launch: ""xLauncher.exe""
(It is NOT recommended to launch DbtS Xtended by starting ""xwindie.exe"" directly.)
(xLauncher does some additional things that may be required for full functionality.)

Enjoy. :)

Needed also is: Microsoft .Net Framework 2.0 installed on your machine

Extra info: If you face any problems with missing files copy any files inside the folder data of the ISO.
To your install dir\data\

You MUST mount the DBTS ISO to play.

,Gamejunkiez,2010-09-16T14:50Z,"- If you face trouble with mixed up colors in ANY game do the following:

- CTRL+SHIFT+ESCAPE.

- Kill: Explorer.exe

- File ---> New Task.

- Now enter the full path to game you wish to run.
(Example: E:\Games\Fallout2\fallout2.exe)

It seems somehow explorer.exe mixes up colors in many games in Vista and 7.

Enjoy. :)"
,Gamejunkiez,2010-09-16T14:52Z,"Forget to note to get your explorer back:

- File ---> New Task.

- Type: Explorer.exe

Enjoy. :)"
,Batus500,2011-09-05T08:48Z,"I cant get it to work it says
