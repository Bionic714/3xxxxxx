,majalogan,2008-03-05T03:26Z,"Dude, while I appreciate your effort, don't pollute the internet by putting up something called ""Bob Marley discography"" when it clearly isn't - there are many, many songs and albums missing. To make matters worse, there are already several equally misleadingly named torrents out there. 

Can someone please put out a REAL Bob Marley discography torrent ? Official album releases starting with Catch A Fire, and deluxe edition cd re-releases when available, would certainly make my day ... this should be easy to find online but it's not, because of shit like this torrent!"

[T],maherie,2008-03-08T10:20Z,"@majalogan

It's funny..... people like you winge when you get things for free, ask people to put up torrents and do the hard work... all so you can shoot them down because you're too lazy to upload and find albums. 

If you think one album is hard to find, try to find some of the ones I found or ripped myself.... I'm not polluting anything... I'm giving to a community that YOU take so much from...

Not even one upload....

Fuck you, and your bullshit non constructive comment.
"
,majalogan,2008-03-09T11:58Z,"Well, sensitive little maherie, I think its great you upload stuff .... I simply asked you to stop polluting and misleading people by giving it a wrong name ... a simple ""Bob Marley XX albums"" would be appropriate, but I shudder to think at all the people who will download this shit, think it really is a BM discography and then decide that Marley is not for them ... they lose out greatly, and its your fault!"
[T],maherie,2008-03-09T13:50Z,"With over 300+ songs no one is going to download this to see if they like bob marley... so silly comment from yourself there.

I stand by my original comment...you try uploading a whole discography of someone people want to listen to, with as hard to find stuff as this.... then you can throw the first stone for sure! Untill then, don't leave comments about quality."
,Swedengaming,2008-03-15T10:12Z,Love Bob marley =) He is the best reggae artist the world ever had!
