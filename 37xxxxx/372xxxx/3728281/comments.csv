,Ultron,2007-07-01T11:23Z,WTF!! this is just build 42...
,FAnTAsYmIND,2007-07-01T14:46Z,"Ah another unmistakeably retarded person.

The patch is for 42 and over. Get a clue -.-"
,Ultron,2007-07-02T01:14Z,"Do you even look at the contents of the file before you upload? After installing trillian and running the patch it still says ""build 47 is still available"""
,FAnTAsYmIND,2007-07-02T02:53Z,"It said it on every build I've used since 42. It's just what it does.

Are you really that daft? Have you checked the About in the program?

I'm not sure if that message is on for alpha testers or because the exe has been changed slightly due to the crack, but it IS 47. Wanna know how I know it is changing? Before build 46 passwords wouldn't save unless you did a certain trick. Now they do.

Are you so n誰eve to think that I didn't check?

What I say to people like you is ""I don't care what you think. You can believe whatever the toss you like""."
