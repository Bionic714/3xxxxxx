Final Battlefield 2 Highway Tampa Released

Following a successful beta, the final version of Highway Tampa for Battlefield 2 is now ready to roll out. DICE, along with our update partner Intel, created this new map focused on tank battles that echo those of Battlefield 1942. Exploding shells ring out across the desert as tank columns meet in furious battle amidst the swirling sands.

Tweaks since the beta version include more infantry cover to help them hold onto flags, improved jeep spawning to better prevent stranded infantry and a number of glitch fixes. We wish to thank the Battlefield community for all the time they put in playing the map and posting feedback to the forums. We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re sure you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll enjoy the epic vehicular warfare in this new map.
