,XxOralSuicidexX,2007-06-30T18:55Z,"But those this work??
will it not fuck up my comp??
what rev is it?
"
,travisnj,2007-06-30T19:16Z,"This is verified to work; infact this torrent is being seeded from this distro.

What was removed? Printer Drivers and Xcode..

So, use Disk Utility and restore this image to your DVD-R... 

Upon installation make sure you customize and uncheck printer drivers.

There are no other alterations to this distro from the WWDC.

What Rev is this? It is in the title of the torrent..

Seeding is not going well, I have seeded 560MB so far and the largest peer out there right now only has 55MB.. I have seen others DL and leave.

I will ONLY seed until 3.22GB is UL'd"

,risko88,2007-07-01T00:15Z,"Hi,
Thanks for the upload!, cant wait untill im done!

I had a question about instalation!
Im downloading on a pc, and ill put it on a mac via a harddisc or my ipod!
then i will unpack the zip file, and then burn the dmg on a disk ? Then install leopard?
Is that the way 2 install?
Can you please help me travisnj!

Thanks a lot!"
,travisnj,2007-07-01T00:26Z,"I will write this step by step to help those that may have tried and failed:

1. Download Zip file (this torrent)
2. You MUST unzip on a Mac
3. Goto Applications>Utility>Disk Utility
4. insert a DVD-R into your burner
5. You will see in Disk Utility the Image of ""Lepoard Boot.sparseimage""
6. You will see the DVD-R as well
7. Click on the DVD-R
8. In the center of the right side of Disk Utility you will see tabs, click on ""RESTORE""
9. You will then see two text boxes, one says source and one says destination
10. Drag N Drop the DVD-R into Destination
11. Drag N Drop the ""Lepoard Boot.sparseimage"" into Source
12. Click ""RESTORE""

Wait for it to be finished; reboot your Mac, when you hear the first ""TONE"" press and hold your ""C"" key; hold the ""C"" until the spiral starts and you can let go of the ""C"" key.

Wait for about 5 mins or longer for you to see the installation screen...

You will press, next a few times and pay attention to the button on the left side bottom that says ""CUSTOMIZE""; click on this and then uncheck PRINTERS; Click install....

That is it... Your done and have installed Lepoard....

BTW, I have tested on Imac G4, PowerBook G4, MacBook Pro and Mac Mini and all work perfect, with one exception...

MacBook Pro looses the Bluetooth; it is not recognized; DO NOT INSTALL IF YOU NEED YOUR BLUETOOTH ON A MACBOOK PRO..."
,cyantist,2007-07-01T00:30Z,"Thanks for the upload.. I DL'd the earlier 6+GB version and couldn't get it to work at all..

I tried with the BOMarchivehelper 
and get it unzipped,
but when i try 2 restore it via disk utility it doesnt work!

I can drag n drop the image, 
and also drag n drop the disk,

but i cant click restore button,
i think it might be a prob with the dvd+r, i also tried dvd+rw.

Can i also try with external HD?

maybe someone can help me!"

performance after install is equal to or better than tiger....

,travisnj,2007-07-02T00:30Z,"For the ones trying an Ext. HDD... I have tried and to no success whatsoever; the only success with the image is to follow the steps; step for step and 1.2.3 in that order..

I can guarantee you that if you follow these steps outlined; you will have an install; and most of all just WAIT FOR IT TO LOAD..

You will boot and will hear your ROM go nuts for a long while.. G4 takes a L O N G time; Intel's take a little bit...

Just W---A-----I-----T"
,Dragon.76,2007-07-02T03:27Z,"Re-burning a startup disc is a BAD idea.  Apple uses some mojo to order the files on the disc so it loads quickly.  BTW, I downloaded, burned, waited the eternity for it to load (on a 2.16GHz CD) and it failed on install saying it couldn't verify the Essentials package.  So much for that."
,cyantist,2007-07-02T03:29Z,"OK, downloaded and installed.. I'm using it now..

Anyways, here's what I did:

First of all, I made a DVD using Disk Utility.. Worked fine.. 

Unzipped .sparseimage, double-click to mount image, run Disk Utility, burn disk image to DVD-R, reboot, hold down 'C', and wait 20+ mins.. (I've been hearing different results for the wait time, but I timed it to 25 mins on my MBP 2.33ghz C2D.. I haven't tried on my PB G4 yet)..

Next, I got to the installer, deselected Printers under the 'Customization' dialog, started installing and ran into some random permissions error about half way thru..

Sooo, I had an idea since I didn't want to wait thru the slowww boot process again.. I repartitioned my ext fw800 hdd into 2 partitions.. Made one partition as small as possible and called it Leopard Install, made the bigger one Leopard, restored the .sparseimage to Leopard Install, choosing 'Erase Destination' and waited about 2 mins.. Reboot holding down 'Option' key and pick Leopard Boot 1 from the list of bootable drives.. 

I'm happy to say that it booted up in about 1 min (instead of 25 mins from the DVD) and was installing in no time!! Deselected everything but X11 in the 'Customization' dialog and it installed perfectly.. No errors this time..

I think it would work either way, but to save a LOT of time, install it from an external drive..

Good luck..
"
,travisnj,2007-07-02T04:12Z,"I always ""skipped"" verification.

Sorry to not mention that... I do like the Ext. HDD but never got it to work.. I would use this image and an EXT HDD like Cyantist did!"

,EyeOfBeauty,2007-07-06T10:18Z,"You must extract on MAC.

Also you must burn with Disctools - else it won't boot.

Open Disctools and select the file on your desktop and choose Burn (do not mount it).

It will take aprox. 1 hour.

When burned put it back in the drive and choose Startupdisk, and choose Boot from OSX Leopard.

Start again and then you have to WAIT - after aprox. 25 minutes things began to happen.

I have put in a new disc (40 GB, formattet it MAC OSX extended) and I installed it here so my old OSX 10.4.10 still works.

Deselect printerdrivers in the Special install menu - they are not on the DVD!!! This will cause erros if you don't deselect.

Continue install - and aprox. 45 minutes later you have a new OSX.

No problems at all when I installed it.

Don't prepare it on your PC - IT WILL NOT WORK!

Enjoy.

3) After it is done converting, use this command:
hdiutil convert /path/to/filename.dmg -format UDTO -o /path/to/savefile.iso


Replace /path/to/filename.dmg with the path and name of the existing .DMG file, and replace /path/to/savefile.iso with the desired path and name for the converted image.

To have Tiger and Leopard on the same hard drive whenthe tiger partition already take  all space. Just disable journaling: do this in terminal: 

# diskutil disableJournal /Volumes/(TigerVolumeName)

After you can use a linux live cd like Ubuntu ( powerpc version exist search on google ) and resize the tiger partition with gparted. After that you can install both, and you can too reenable journaling in tiger and leopard."
