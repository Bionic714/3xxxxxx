Think there are more than me with the same problem......"
,Metalnight,2007-07-21T07:26Z,"For all of you that´s stuck on 99,8%....
Jump over the files that aren´t completed.
And then download the first torrernt from ""odoman"" with Jimi Hendrix. This one is a re-seed as you all know. Just download the songs your missing and then you get a complete download in the end. Worked for me."
