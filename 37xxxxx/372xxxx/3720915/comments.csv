Here are two good tutorials if you are having trouble:

http://www.afterdawn.com/faq/general_playback/how_do_i_play_bin_and_cue_files.cfm

If you are burning to a cd (yes, it fits), you do have to open the cue file and edit the bin file name to match the actual file.
   Mac OS X users:
After download, right click on the cue file, select ""Open With"" - ""Other"", and select Textedit.app. Edit the cue file to match the actual bin file name (at very top). Click save and quit Textedit. If you have Toast, right click on the cue file and select ""Toast It"". Insert a blank CD when prompted and burn. Worked perfect with Toast Titanium 7.1.2 on OS X 10.4.8."
