[V],kopimi,2007-06-28T01:31Z,but it's bluray! it's great ;)
,oswald1234,2007-07-01T11:44Z,Big black bars(flaps) on this ho. Looks O.K on 50+ inch DLP screens.
,devil_66,2007-07-17T02:14Z,i can hardly wait to watch this on my hdtv... :D
,dddddd,2007-07-23T21:53Z,"Great picture, but DTS track heavily distorted when running passthrough to amplifier using Mplayer."
,piloteer,2007-12-30T03:57Z,Works great for me with Windows XP codec pack BUT Is there any way to turn the subs off? 
,Digital_Exc,2008-02-04T03:04Z,"Oswald.. the original dvd has black bars too!!.. You hardly see 16:9 movies.. Most main stream movies are 2.35:1 or even 1.78.1 hence the black bars..

Thanks for uploading this one, a bit large, but i just want the quality and i will not complain :-)"
,scottm86,2008-02-12T18:55Z,"will this work on a bluray player, or just on the computer?"
,mjaniszewski2,2008-03-30T20:42Z,"Digital_Exc, funny you say so, as 1.78:1 is exactly 16:9.
anyone could post mediainfo output of this file?"
,mjaniszewski2,2008-03-30T20:47Z,"piloteer, as for turning subs off you should have dvobsub icon in tray (little green arrow) or haali media splitter (same icon as default of matroska container), right click on it and the option to turn off the subs should be there."
,Ausnen,2008-07-13T22:17Z,"Its says blueray but the source is HDDVD? nice..

A notices that many HD movies is sharp but still have bad quality, clean rips. 
I have this movie in 720p at around 2.5GB but with much noice and pixelated squares in the background, hope this doesn't have it.."

,nightlite,2010-06-10T18:19Z,"Hey guys, all ppl should have higher upload speeds. Im seeding at 2 mb per second. So just think that someone's uploading what you're downloading. Give and take. The data doesn't come out of thin air."
,nightlite,2010-06-10T18:20Z,"""Hey guys, all ppl should have higher upload speed""


What I meant was that people shouldn't have limit like 1kb/s upload on their torrent clients. everyone should share."
,nightlite,2010-06-10T21:07Z,seeding at 5mb/s and will continue seeding for some time....
