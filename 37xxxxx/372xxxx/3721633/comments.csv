,gutterball213,2007-08-26T06:08Z,"Worked like a charm. Set firewall to block, and it's all good. Thx Zoracic."
,Zoracic,2007-08-27T10:31Z,"If you don't want programs connecting to the Internet without your permission use the FREE firewall called ZoneAlarm http://www.zonealarm.com (direct link http://www.zonealarm.com/store/content/catalog/products/sku_list_za.jsp?dc=56pus&ctry=GB〈=en (may work only for a short time if they update the URL)). Remember, pick the free version.

It will ask you everytime something tries to connect."
,Zoracic,2007-08-31T09:39Z,"Meant to say, you can stop ConvertXToDVD connecting to the Internet by clicking on SETTINGS in the program."
,Comegowithme,2007-09-27T14:18Z,"-Works great.  Simple to use and effective.
Did not allow internet connection!

,derfyderfyderfy,2008-01-24T13:48Z,program works fine.  simple to use.  thanks.
,mazzer123,2008-01-26T08:58Z,"great app! to add subs you need to open root directory for film (hit '+'), then highlight the line '0 Subtitle Stream....' given, before hitting 'add subtitle channel' under 'File' tab. Insert, say, SRT file. Then if you want other than latin adjust 'code page' in '...' menu. "
