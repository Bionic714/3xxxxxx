USAF Instruction movie about the Hellcat.

After the experience in the early part of the war with F4F Wildcats, Grumman consulted with Allied Air Forces to 
develop a successor to the F4F. This new aircraft was to be called the F6F Hellcat. The prototype, XF6F-1, first 
flew on June 26, 1942. The first production model was the F6F-3 which first flew in October 1942. Grumman then 
produced an improved Hellcat designated the F6F-5. This Hellcat first flew on April 4, 1944. This new model 
quickly replaced the F6F-3 models. Production lasted until November 1945, when the F8F replaced the F6F. 
Hellcats are credited with the destruction of 4,947 aircraft up to V-J Day. The Hellcat was the first aircraft 
the Navy had for its Blue Angels demonstration team.
