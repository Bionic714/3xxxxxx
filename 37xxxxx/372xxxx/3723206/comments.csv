Also, quality work from Dopeman, as always."
,alkador,2010-07-14T21:37Z,"Okay for those who still want to upgrade the Dopeman version of this game with these patches but you can\\\'t download them from here -> Workaround:nnThe main problem is that the patch installer does not \\\'see\\\' that you installed the game, the way the Dopeman hacked patches work is by just copying the actual --content-- of the .exe patch installers, then activating via keygen. Hence: Hacked patches. nnWay I fixed it is by doing what Dopeman did, extracting the contents of the patch file. Here is how: nn1 - Download the official patches. (Remember : 1.6 and 1.7 are Multiplayer Fixes only. If you don\\\'t play MP then there is no reason to Download!)nn2 - Download (free) program \\\'Universal Extractor\\\' (google it or summin\\\')nn3 - Install Extractor program. (Won\\\'t lead u through this, use common sense, e.g. click next- next - next.)nn4 - Fire up the extractor - point it to the patch file (e.g. \\\'2w_upgrade_12_to_13\\\') - use the option \\\'Wise Installer /x Switch\\\'.nn5 - Let it do its thing, press \\\'ok\\\' when a window comes up, etc. (remember, the default spot for extracted data is in the same folder as the patch file, in a folder named after the patch file. So if the patch file is on your desktop, there should be a new folder named e.g. \\\'2w_upgrade_12_to_13\\\' )nn6 - Done. U should have the contents of the patch file, which is basically what is in this torrent! nn7 - Buy the original and be sure to buy part 2 which should be coming out soon.nnNow this game better be good, haven\\\'t even played it for more than 5 min\\\'s but wantin\\\' to play it all patched up, see if its any good ;)"
