,fejop,2008-09-10T07:36Z,"I guess this SHOULD work, but it doesn't. The HEX codes doesn't get replaced as the Text does. Any idea why?"
,Mentalbox,2009-08-19T10:05Z,"I believe the hex-codes mentioned in this tutorial is constantly updated as the tibiabot versions are updated. There's a new hex-code required for each new tibiabot-installation you're trying to install. So this only works for a specific tibiabot, probably 8.1 or similar.."
