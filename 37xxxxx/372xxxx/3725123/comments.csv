,funkygek29,2008-05-26T18:55Z,"Nothing is free.  As you study these incredible guitar lessons you?ll understand the price that you paid for stealing this material.  While you?re gaining incredible insight on how to master the guitar, your subconscious will gain insight into your lack of personal integrity, and dishonesty. Every time you practice these exercises you?ll dwell on the fact that you stole this program.  

Can you imagine? Even twenty years from now as you pick up the guitar to work on these techniques, both your subconcious and concious minds will be dwelling on your dishonesty and lack of integrity.  You helped destroy the business that created these lessons.  Truth is, you?ll lose interest in playing guitar for this reason.  You?ll see.

I?m one of Michael Angelo Batio?s students (Michael is the creator of Speed Kills).  You?re stealing directly from him, the instructor.  He creates these lessons and sells them to his students directly.  This is how he makes a living.  You?re not stealing from some huge corporation.  You?re stealing from a guy making an honest living putting together lessons that have helped thousands of guitarists reach their potential.  

These DVDs sell for $19.95 each.  That?s a small price to pay to not feel like a thief for the rest of your life.  Trust me on that one. Plus, for $19.95 you get a high quality DVD not these blurry, compressed video files.  You get a manual so you can actually learn this stuff.  You get chapters to easily navigate the program.  You get a goal list, a chapter list, and animated tab to play along with these exercises.  And you get to not feel like a lowlife scumbag for the rest of your life.  Maybe that?s why most people are honest ? it feels good.  It feels like you?re doing the right thing.  Wouldn?t you like to feel good about yourself?  http://www.metalmethod.com/lead-guitar-lesson-speed-kills.htm

,ViciousOne,2008-06-10T08:30Z,"funkygek29, since you?re a student, would you happen to have any idea to whom you?re talking to?  And yet you are amongst us... this is not called ""The Pirate Bay"" for nothing..... and as for loosing sleep... get real... when I am on stage using a new riff or technique I just learned form these lessons... I will be thinking about the chick?s that think I rock and the piece of A** I am getting once I leave the stage not about this crap.

I download a lot of things from here and I don't get that feeling because I don't give a fuck."

If you're trying to make us feel so bad about downloading this film..

Why the hell are do you have a registered account on this website? 

tl;dr - Dude you're a douche"
,redlikewater,2008-10-27T19:46Z,"the funky geek 29 has lost his god damn mind!  This is the Pirate Bay you silly tool.  We come here to steal shit and evade U.S. Copyright bullshit.
In 20 years from now my sacks will be shriveled from all the hot ass I got because I mastered this ""stolen"" material.  THAT is what I'll be thinking about..."
,lwpjb,2008-11-29T17:37Z,"Hey funkygek29,

I haven't downloaded this torrent, so I don't know if your former teacher is any good or not. What I do know is that STEALING is STEALING.. be it from a Corporation or a small business. YOU have an account and handle name here... which tells me that like US ALL... you have downloaded at least SOMETHING from here. Your prior post is self-righteous and hypocritical if you really think about it. Why is it ok for you to rip (possibly countless) CDs, DVDs, and bits of software from a Corporation, yet unethical to take an (apparently) out-of-sync video guitar lesson from Michael Angelo Batio? 

Stealing is indeed stealing.. and whether you have taken files from a big company or a one man business... you are indeed STEALING. I don't think a judge would discern a difference between you and anyone taking your teacher's video lesson. 

I have a friend that works for a DVD authoring company. They get contracted by big film companies all the time. He gets a small chunk of every unit sold.... just like Michael does for his video.. When you, me, or anyone downloads a DVD rip from anything he worked on, he is losing a royalty payment too. This shit is what it is. If you are so ""honorable"" and full of integrity.. then delete this and any other torrenting account you may have and stop this shit altogether. Otherwise, you are a piece of shit like the rest of us and WORSE, ... you are  a fucking hypocrite. "
,alansh1,2009-07-07T04:49Z,"funkygek29 as you review your own amateurish use of psuedo-hypnosis and really really begin to understand at the deepest level the total void your life has become when you entire focus has become worry that some underappreciated metal guitarist didn't make his dime from a dvd sale you may just notice all the failures in your own life.  And as you reflect on those failures, so many things that have brought you to this point, you may notice they plague you.  They keep popping up in your mind.  Like a little mosquito, just before you go to bed, when you wake up, as you step in the shower, they keep coming to mind, only stonger and stonger each and every time they re-occur often to the point where, in the end, you completely understand what you have to do.  Isn't it obvious?  If life has only brought you this far, after all, what's the use - what can a mere few more years do for you anyway.  Listen to what your mind instructs you to do, take the easy way out, isn't it?  Best of luck."
