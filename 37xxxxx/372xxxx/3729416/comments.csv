Listen to the tracks and buy the album afterwards  - they deserve it!"

Sweet thank you SO much for uploading this. This new record label isn't going to like Tom uploading their songs to PirateBay before release date anymore than their last label did, so, I hope ppl do still go and buy it or go see them.
