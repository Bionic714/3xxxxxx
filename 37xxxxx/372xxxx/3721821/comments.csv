Does life end in death? Or does the soul wander from body to body? Are there such things as demons, ghosts or the devil? Following circumstantial research and in cooperation with top-calibre scholars, this series sheds light upon, unmasks and takes the magic from centuries-old superstition and also reports on breathtaking, super sensory experiences. It also shows if, and where, things that cannot be explained really do exist?The journey in search of the Supernatural leads to all six continents, to such fascinating spots as the holy Tibetan city, Lhasa and to the great universities of the world; to the secret archives of the CIA and the KGB, the Vatican, and to the most modern centres of nuclear research in the world. The result is a thrilling combination of contemporary history, scientific background reporting, and a touch of the pleasant shiver within the dark side of parapsychology.

,Catee,2008-03-13T22:43Z,"Not a bad series of six 50 min. eps.  I do wish they were compressed down a bit more, they're a little large.

Each ep focuses on a ""supernatural"" topic - exorcism, ghosts, mind over matter, near death experiences, reincarnation and telepathy.  Scientists, skeptics and believers alike are interviewed and, when possible, scientific explanations are presented.  At the end of each ep they leave you with the unanswered questions.

The final ep, telepathy, is quite interesting as they present skeptics and scientists who in the other eps really scoffed but on the issue of telepathy they conceded that something worth studying is certainly going on that science can't yet explain.  This ep also talks about the Psy department created by the US government in 1975 and their use of telepathic ""remote viewers"" to see what is happening in hidden areas of enemy territory.  This program is still operational with great success, though no one seems to know why it is successful.

Worth a download and viewing....  Thanks Meki!
