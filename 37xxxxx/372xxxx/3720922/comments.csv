What should I do in such a case? Thanks in advance!"

,SirMelbator,2007-07-17T13:21Z,No sweat! I solved the problem successfully and everything is all right now. But sometimes my pc freezes while playing. Don't you know what causes this? My pc suit the requirements.

,SirMelbator,2007-07-20T15:47Z,"It's unbelievable. Every second game freezes. So the game can stop any time, whether I expect it or not. Does it not bother any one else? Don't you know if the manufacturers released patch files to the game? Because it will be more and more unenjoyable if everything remains unchanged. "
