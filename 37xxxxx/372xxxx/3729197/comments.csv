,420dopeman,2007-07-01T15:47Z,The same fix above should work to activate for vista also...

,420dopeman,2007-07-01T17:09Z,"Most def. another problem. Check system requirements first. Then install or re-install the DX9 mentioned above, (I mention re-install because DX9 files often become corrupt or misplaced throughout your system), DX9 auotsearches and updates what's needed when you re-install. Last , be sure all your vid and sound drivers are up to date. g-luck"
,TeRmS,2007-07-01T17:14Z,"Everything is up to date when it comes to drivers.
But, when i started halo 2 i created a new online account, thats what we are suppose to do right?=)"
,420dopeman,2007-07-01T17:27Z,"Yes, but you need to be sure windows or any other firewall is not conflicting with the game. And most definatly need to configure your firewall to block all connections of this game to the internet, which sound as if that's exactly whats happening."

In terms of graphics all that really sucks is the facial animations.  When you turn up the graphic options the graphics are quite beautiful.  However you need a fast rig to play that way.  And If you read a little...not too much or your heads might explode...youll find that you need to download the activation fix for this game.  If you cannot figure out how to get it than you shouldnt be installing ripped games such as these to your machine.  I gave you a hint on how to find it earlier in the post.....oh I forgot....you cant read.

 Greetings fellow pirates.

 There is indeed a new enemy amongst torrents and they are trying to control
 all good gaming torrents everywhere. Leeching and dumping data, not sharing
 a bit of data, which is making it near impossible to download many torrents.

 I have included a dopeman_blocklist.txt file. YOU MUST load this file to
 Peerguardian as an addtional blocklist -or- load the file to whatever means
 of IP blocking you have available to your BT Client.

 If you do not, you will simply be sharing data to these cowards and not other
 legit torrent users trying to download. 

 Please try to understand the importance of this. It must be used to begin
 saving game torrents everywhere. This is a new enemy. We must do our best 
 to fight back to preserve our freedom of sharing. 

 Please use the blocklist and share it anyway you can.

,lalala1,2007-07-22T06:36Z,"This does work, if you have the correct directx per instructions.  In addition, if you are having problems with level 12 asking for the DVD, download and run microsofts Process Monitor while the level is loading. Somehow this causes the level to load correctly on most machines--perhaps due to the overhead lagging the DVD check until it times out.

,Arrowstream,2007-09-03T07:49Z,A huge load of thanks dopeman.
,Arrowstream,2007-09-04T22:20Z,"Here is one for all of those who seem to know half of nothing.
If you are missing the d3dx9_31. something file, reinstall DX9 until you get it.
After playing the first level(you can do it before as well) download dopeman's PERMANENT ACTIVATION FIX and follow the EASY instructions. You're good to go. Once you reach lvl 12 (Gravemind) do as lalala1 suggests and get Process Monitor from the link provided by lalala1 on the fifth page of comments. 
Install ProcessMon and run it. Then enter Halo 2, go Campaing, select level and select Gravemind.
If you have process monitor running now it WILL WORK. Just did ot myself. However, expect a VERY long loading time. And by VERY LONG I mean like ten minutes(that what it was for me. Centrion Duo 1.8GHz, 1GB RAM, 256 MB graphics)
After the level has loaded, if you want to see the intro before it, just enter the menu by pressing 'Esc' and click 'restart level'. Don't worry, you will start at the beginning of the movie at will not have to reload the whole thing. 
Enjoy Gravemind, IMO the best level on the whole game.
After completeing it, re-enter Windows and shut down ProcessMon, since it takes un necessary space. Once you have, the thirteenth level should load like usual. After that you're good to go."

Ok guys look when you are installing Dirext x sometimes it doesnt update the file d3dx9_31.dll. Now in order to solve this either reinstall till u get it or google the file name go to a link where u can download the dll and after u do extcract it at the following location. C:\windows\system 32 after u do so u should be able by going to this file to find the file allong with the d3dx9_29.dll and d3dx9_32.dll 9 ( they arent placed in a folder ). After this u might have problem with the Winxput1_dll or something like that file do the same actions that u did for d3dx9_31.dll.

After following the installation instructions I can launch the game, create a player, go through the heretic cut scene, and then the initial scene of the armory stage when the guy complains about you beating up the armor.

When it fades to white where the actual game is supposed to start (and you adjust targeting) my screen just stays white, never moves on.  I have reinstalled many times, tried the directX from april and from June 07 and even the automated installer someone else posted, always the same.  I have a decent computer, AMD 64 3200, 1 gig ram, 6800GT Ultra which was playable with Oblivion.

Forcing VSYNC caps your fps at yor refresh rate level. Windowed mode is displayed in sync with the refresh rate by default."

My halo 2 works, but very badly. I've seen this in a few comments but it has not been fully answered.
I am running it on XP with a ATI Radeon x1950 PRO 3.2 GHZ 2 Gig ram and i feel like the frame rate is like 5-10 at the best of times.
It is SO Choppy. . I've changed the mouse sensitivity to 10 (INSANE) just to be able to move a bit to shoot someone. I have halo 1 downloaded on my computer, and even that looks atleast 100 times better.
I'm not sure if it's an obvious reason for the lack of windows vista.

,Chaos_Seer,2007-09-29T02:22Z,"Hey guys,

I've installed the XP fix that's advertised here (and correctly).

Here's the thing:
I've got the option to connect to Live
I've got the option to play on the Network.

The problem is when I get to The Gravemind level, I'm told to put in the Halo 2 CD (which I obviously don't have :P)

If I have the correct file in the System32 folder, but not in the Halo 2 folder, I can't play at all because it asks for the CD and doesn't allow Live/Network options. If I do it vice-verca, I get an illegal error. This basically means that the fix isn't working right.

Anyone have this problem?"

For those that keep complaining about the cd key message or activation READ THE PREVIOUS POSTS! get the activation files.

The game downloads, installs, and boots up just fine. But after that, it's almost as if there's a memory leak. It maxes out my processor resources and has horrible frame rate, even when there's no action on screen. Even during the opening scenes it was jerky, as was the dialogue, making it nearly impossible to understand what was going on. It's weird, because it was alright for the first minute or two before that started.

,meganoggin,2007-11-21T00:17Z,"ok, i have had the same problem with the .bat file not working
I found the XP activation fix (the one designed for people who bought the game and have XP) and compared that to what the .bat file said.
Seeing that they were exactly the same (but with different directions of course), i did the following:
Using 'cmd.exe' (the command window) i navigated to the directory where ""loader.exe"" was.
Then i typed in ""loader.exe halo2.exe"", which is what the .bat does anyway
but.......it ran for like 1 millionth of a second and then said ""access denied""
WTF!!!!! what the hell does that mean and how does that make sense at all?!?!?!


..any help would be appreciated"

I'm a Vista 32 bit guy as well.  Vista 32 recommends that you run the op. sys. with at least 2gb of ram.  My computer came with 2gb and I went and bought and installed another 2gb of ram ($84 on sale), which the op. sys. can utilize 3.5gb total - you can never have too much ram.  Think about buying and installing more; it's easy.  However, 1gb is sufficient for this game (check out http://www.systemrequirementslab.com).  It could be your graphics card or something else - that website will find what you need.  Whenever I have problems I read the prior comments (all of them) for insight - they usually heip.  Reextracting and reinstalling often works too.  I'm only 2 weeks old to the torrent, Azureus, etc. world and equally as new to gaming, but I hope this helps.

Nice name by the way.

I'll be of greater help once I get it download.

Speaking of that - - - there's 250 possible seeds and none, zero, zip are connected!!  C'mon guys pay it forward - help out the bro's.  SEED!!!!"

,kudosa,2008-03-12T00:26Z,"For those who dont know: Dopeman torrents >

You dont need to ""install"" just run from the game folder.
You cant patch unless there is a specific dopeman patch.
You cant play online unless you use a private server.
You will need to install directx and /or ageis phsyx which will be included.
Files sizes are smaller because the game has been specially hacked to reduce size. (movies etc re-encoded)
Doctors dont use leeches anymore, Seed your torrents.
Respect to Dopeman/Fairlight/Crystal"

  I had to download another fix to get gravemind to load. But this version works perfectly after you install both fixes.

  I'm really busy right now but later I will post a links to both fixes and a thorough step-by-step walkthrough for how to install this game, install both fixes, and configure this game to work almost perfectly on xp.

  Fair warning to anyone who has played either the xbox or Vista version of H2, the XP version has no bloom lighting for some reason."

,duncanbmcg,2008-03-13T18:25Z,I've gone through all the comments.. I have XP.  I load the XP PLAY HALO 2.bat file and the cmd comes up for a split second and then closes.  I have the latest DirectX.. Someone please answer this question.. hundreds of people are asking it. What's the problem.
,ben_high,2008-03-13T20:05Z,"

  Alright, here's how to get this version working 100% on windowsXP without activation problems or problems with the gravemind level loading. Any DirectX problems you have are between you and your DirectX, you'll have to fix that yourself.



  DOWNLOAD #1
  Download this copy of Halo2 of course.

  Step 1.) No need to install dopemans games. Just Create a folder named Halo 2 anywhere you want the game then use winrar to unrar the Halo 2 file to that folder.

  Step 2.) Go to the folder that you unrared the Halo 2 file to and find the folder that says ""INSTALL THESE FIRST"". Install XLiveRedist1.0.6027.msi, then vcredist.msi.

  Step 3.) Dopemans readme says to use ""XP PLAY HALO.bat to start Halo 2. Don't use it. If you use his you wont be able to get past gravemind. We will make a replacement with download #3


  DOWNLOAD #2
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3728782/[PC]_Halo_2_XP_ACTIVATION_FIX_[crejbi]_[dopeman]

  Step 1.) Inside of this download are 2 folders, Halo 2 and System 32, open System 32 first and minimize the folder.

  Step 2.) Navigate to and open your sytem 32 folder in your windows directory. Drag and drop the file from activation fix system 32 folder into your windows system 32 folder.

  Step 3.) Do the same with the file in the activation fix Halo 2 folder. Drag and drop the file into your Halo 2 folder. 



  DOWNLOAD #3
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3749054/Halo_2_XP_Gravemind_Level_Fix

  Step 1.) Unrar the downloaded file and move both the loaderplus.exe and WowMon.Dll files to your Halo 2 folder.

  Step 2.) Open a new text file in Notepad. Copy this into it.

@echo off
cls
title HALO 2
cls
Loaderplus.exe halo2.exe
cls
echo 

  Step 3.) Close and save the text file. Now rename it Halo 2.bat  This is the file you double-click to start Halo 2 now, so go ahead and ""send to desktop"" (create a desktop shortcut) if you want.

  Game should now work perfectly when launched from Halo 2.bat  

  Step 4 is skippable. just a heads up for those that don't know.

  Step 4.) If you dont like that ugly batch file icon on your desktop then you can replace it. Right-click on your desktop icon then click on properties. Click on ""choose icon"". It will give you some message about not having an icon but just click ok. Click on browse and navigate to your Halo 2 folder and use either the startup.exe or the halo2.exe icons. Doesnt matter which as they are both identical. 


  I re-read this post 3 times and I don't see where I missed any steps so outside of DirectX problems this game should work perfectly for all Windows XP users."
,Nord92,2008-03-13T20:37Z,Working fine and i have vista and 
,Diffitz,2008-03-15T23:10Z,search for your missing dll file on google and download it
,Neoncillo,2008-03-17T20:24Z,"Well... I've the (stupid) Windows Vista, first I'd errors with two .dll archives, I replaced it then the game open correcly, but now it say there is a problem with the MFPlat.dll"
,ben_high,2008-03-17T23:20Z,"

  Did you read dopemans read-me that came with this download Neoncillo? The readme says Vista users only need to remove 1 file from the Halo 2 folder then start with halo2.exe instead of a .bat file. I don't have the readme on hand but i think that's what it says.


  Also if anyone has followed my instructions for installing on XP and it worked for you please speak up. Also let me know if any steps were difficult to follow so I know what to fix so I can repost it on the next page."
,Neoncillo,2008-03-18T09:18Z,"I remove the .dll that is in the info of dopeman, but then it had a error of one .dll (Was for didn have directX 9). Now it work fine, thanks to dopeman."

does anyone noe if this works well?"
,k5josh,2008-06-18T03:55Z,"To all who have problems (copied from ben_high's post):

Alright, here's how to get this version working 100% on windowsXP without activation problems or problems with the gravemind level loading. Any DirectX problems you have are between you and your DirectX, you'll have to fix that yourself.



DOWNLOAD #1
Download this copy of Halo2 of course.

Step 1.) No need to install dopemans games. Just Create a folder named Halo 2 anywhere you want the game then use winrar to unrar the Halo 2 file to that folder.

Step 2.) Go to the folder that you unrared the Halo 2 file to and find the folder that says ""INSTALL THESE FIRST"". Install XLiveRedist1.0.6027.msi, then vcredist.msi.

Step 3.) Dopemans readme says to use ""XP PLAY HALO.bat to start Halo 2. Don't use it. If you use his you wont be able to get past gravemind. We will make a replacement with download #3


DOWNLOAD #2
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3728782/[PC]_Halo_2_XP_ACTIVATION_FIX_[crejbi]_[dopeman]

Step 1.) Inside of this download are 2 folders, Halo 2 and System 32, open System 32 first and minimize the folder.

Step 2.) Navigate to and open your sytem 32 folder in your windows directory. Drag and drop the file from activation fix system 32 folder into your windows system 32 folder.

Step 3.) Do the same with the file in the activation fix Halo 2 folder. Drag and drop the file into your Halo 2 folder.



DOWNLOAD #3
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3749054/Halo_2_XP_Gravemind_Level_Fix

Step 1.) Unrar the downloaded file and move both the loaderplus.exe and WowMon.Dll files to your Halo 2 folder.

Step 2.) Open a new text file in Notepad. Copy this into it.

@echo off
cls
title HALO 2
cls
Loaderplus.exe halo2.exe
cls
echo

Step 3.) Close and save the text file. Now rename it Halo 2.bat This is the file you double-click to start Halo 2 now, so go ahead and ""send to desktop"" (create a desktop shortcut) if you want.

Game should now work perfectly when launched from Halo 2.bat

Step 4 is skippable. just a heads up for those that don't know.

Step 4.) If you dont like that ugly batch file icon on your desktop then you can replace it. Right-click on your desktop icon then click on properties. Click on ""choose icon"". It will give you some message about not having an icon but just click ok. Click on browse and navigate to your Halo 2 folder and use either the startup.exe or the halo2.exe icons. Doesnt matter which as they are both identical.

After a while of minimal tampering, I was able to boot into LIVE and see my acc preferences and other stuff. In other words, I logged online in Halo 2 on XP! 

There is major issue though. You can't play online! When I entered the server browser, the servers came up but I was unable to join. The error message ""You are unable to join. Please try again in a few moments"". Though you still can't join after a ""few moments"". I'm pretty sure that single player achievements work though.

Everything SEEMS to work fine, and my machine has XP, but when I run Halo 2 for it using the .bat, it STARTS the game, and I see the initial load screen and Gregorian chanting, but then it flashes, turns black, music stops, and the game quits (While making my resolution the SMALLEST it will go.) 

I also put in the Permanent Activation Fix, but that did nothing (not that I expected it to.)

Possible problems?
   -My machine fits all the requirements EXCEPT that it requires 1gb RAM and I have 960gb RAM- But I figured since the ""Minimum Requirements"" are also the ""Recommended Requirements"" according to windows, the accepted range kind of fits into my range. Would the game really end itself if I'm short just a few MB? "

Extract.  Play.

for the activation crap...  
move the mf.dll in this to windows\system
and get the razor cracked mf.dll and put that into the game folder.

all works good.

Kind of lame game tho.  if you dual wield a weapon you can no longer swap weapons.

the control setup is real sad.

and the storyline is kind of empty this time around."

(http://www.blogsdna.com/2159/how-to-take-ownership-grant-permissions-to-access-files-folder-in-windows-7.htm)

then u Copy mf.dll file from SYSMTE32 folder and paste in ur windows system32 folder.
Again copy mf.dll from FOR HALO 2 FOLDER and paste that in your halo 2 installation folder.
and then u remove the MFPlat.dll file from the main directory called Halo 2 but this is for win 7 and vista only

          have fun win 7 and vista users
If it worked PLz thank me. ;)"
,superman101,2010-02-19T19:42Z,"UPDATE FROM PREVIOUS POST
----------------------------------------

The very first comment for this torrent links you to a permanent fix for the activation error. I downloaded it and that solved my problem...XP users should do the same. It might not work for Vista and Win 7 users but it's still worth a shot.

@GodIsTheWay2012

You're right, and although I knew that before your statement I'll thank you anyway. Thanks."
,superman101,2010-02-20T07:43Z,"READ THIS IS YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE!!!!

Along with my first two comments, I found a solution for all XP users. If you're having the activation error, get the permanent fix via the first comment for this torrent. If you're having issues with the game asking you for the disk, check this out:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3749054/Halo_2_XP_Gravemind_Level_Fix

This will fix that problem but you'll need to make a batch file for it to work. Follow markxing and his instructions in the comment section after following the instructions in the torrent. That will solve the 'insert disk' problem.

I can't thank dopeman and everyone else enough for making this game possible on XP. It's a headache every now n then but in my opinion it's worth it. THANKS!!!"

I suggest u don't use the provided xliveredist
and download latest ""games for windows live""
from microsoft. install it after installing halo

Then run halo, sign out if u have an existing account(profile). then create a new profile
but this time just scroll below of the documentation it shows u and there should be a ""Create local profile""(written in BLUE). just click on that, enter your name ,click ok

ur offline account shud be done . you can now save games, it wont ask for key.

But after 3rd level it will ask for activation
.then u shud use the crack this torrent provides
and then u can play all the levels."

Suggestions?"

Thanks to ben_high for finding this, and to dopeman for uploading. Yes, i know this is fix for xp but i'm running windows 7 and it fixed the request for activation after the 3rd level and probably the rest of the game.

To fix, it says you have to copy two .dll files to Halo 2 install directory and to System 32. However, Windows 7 did not let me replace the .dll in system 32, only keep both files and have one with (2) in front. I ran Halo2.exe as administrator. for the first time it did the Bungie intro animation and let me advance past the 3rd level perfectly.

works for xp and vista also
just make sure you take ownershop of the mf.dll file in system32 and remember to set it so you have full control over the file :)

also want to mention that the file is needed for windows media player, so if you use that program or use the firefox plugin for it, you might want to make sure you back up that file beforehand :)"

,torrentreview,2011-09-05T14:59Z,"I'm here to try out torrents and feedback on them.

For me & from some that commented, the first stage could only be completed & the activation nag would come in.

You can try http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3728782/[PC]_Halo_2_XP_ACTIVATION_FIX_[crejbi]_[dopeman], it would be more direct, but won't work for some, as Vista & 7 would not allow the file to be overwritten.

You can then try http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3729916/[PC]_Halo_2_XP_ACTIVATION_WORKAROUND_[dopeman], it would be more complicated, but should be able to work.

This is a good torrent, thanks dopeman for making the effort."
,TyMod,2011-09-10T19:32Z,Download my version.  No it will not work on XP.  Why? Because this one will.  But it works great on Windows 7.  Please read the comments though if you have a 32 bit computer.  It will save you and me ALOT of time.
,finisher489,2011-09-11T19:40Z,Does this work with Windows 7???? Plz answer I don't want to waste hours downloading it then finding out that it doesn't work!!! Give me an honest answer.

,Tecness2,2011-10-28T18:21Z,"For all of you who complain about it not working on windows 7. IT SAYS IT WORKS ON WINDOWS XP AND WINDOWS VISTA. In that list, I do NOT see windows 7. So I doubt it will work on windows 7, unless you aren't a total noob (which most of you are) and can actually modify a few things to get it to work on windows 7. Thank you and have a nice day."

,yonigga123,2011-11-05T13:02Z,"PLS SEE THIS halo 2 should work on xp FULLY

1)Download this torrent.If Halo 2 works till the level ""Quarantine Zone"",skip step 2.

2)Go to the following site and follow instructions.Halo 2 SHOULD work till the level ""Quarantine Zone"".

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3728782/

3)1st and foremost, I want to say that follow MY instructions in this step.DO NOT FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN ON THE SITE AS DOPEMAN'S TORRENT IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. :

1)Go to the following site and download torrent.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4039787/Halo.2.XP.Gravemind.Fix-TheBabeLover

2)copy WowMon.dll and Loaderplus.exe into your Halo 2 directory (same place
     as wow.dll and loader.exe)

3)Right click ""XP PLAY HALO 2"" and click ""Edit"".You should see notepad in which things like ""echo off"" are written.

4)In the notepad,replace the words ""Loader.exe"" with the words ""loaderplus.exe"".

AFTER THIS ENTIRE HALO 2 SHOULD WORK. IF IT DOESNT UR PC IS HOPELESS."
