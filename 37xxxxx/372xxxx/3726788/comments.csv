Enjoy the advantage and benefits of having a Basic Learning Artificial Intelligence program running from your flashdrive or harddrive (RAM). Including:

?	Portable on demand information.
?	Ask the AI a question and access either its own rich database of information, teach or use the Web Search function.
?	Teach the AI to remember complex tasks that you may only do once in a while.
?	Use Reminder to set AI to tell you of events.
?	Allow the AI to help keep personal contact detail?s for example ?Gary?s telephone number is 01208 77000?.
?	Attach file?s (programs or documents) links to answers and question?s. Example Document-?Where is Gary Smith?s CV?? or Batch-?Show me open tcp and udp connections to my computer?
?	Great for telephone help desks or other company?s using networking to build and hold information on procedures or objection answers for quick access by employee?s.
?	And did I mention you can use this on a flashdrive and take it from computer to computer.
