This rip is from the 2-disc Special Edition PAL PAL of Gi√π La Testa / A Fistful Of Dynamite / Duck You Sucker / Once Upon A Time... The Revolution directed by Sergio Leone. It contains the movie, an audio commentary track by Sir Christopher Frayling and the extras from Disc 2 (Trailers, info about the restoration and the different version of the original movie and more). Total about 3h37min and all encoded in XviD/MP3 so that it will fit nicely on two CDs (Thanks to the movie being very easy to encode with lots of quite static scenes). The movie is resized to 540x272 and is relatively sharp, and has very little blocking.

If you want more perfect quality, then buy the DVD.
