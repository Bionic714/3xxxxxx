DAEMON Tools is an application for multiprotection emulation. It is further development of Generic Safedisc emulator and incorporates all its features. This program allows running backup copies of SafeDisc, Securom, or Laserlock protected games. Also included is a Virtual DVDROM drive enabling you to use your CD images as if they were already burned to CD. It works with all types of CD/DVDROM drives and supports nearly any CD protection.

Latest changes:

    * This new version supports silent setup now.
