,jurek123,2007-06-22T11:31Z,"4X-AXG - Thx, but it still is bad :("
,4X-AXG,2007-06-22T11:33Z,hmm okay..so the problem is the autogen houses not being textured?
,charonB,2007-06-22T11:43Z,"Hey 4X-AXG: Where are your files from? (Two have the same name, but are different, the others are not found in my installation?

PS: Won't be home over the weekend. :/"
,4X-AXG,2007-06-22T11:43Z,"see this is what you get when rips are not made properly..argh..okay, try this..if this doesn't solve the problem, count me out..we'll have to wait on a new rip then"
,tomtom94,2007-06-22T11:44Z,I stay this now

,4X-AXG,2007-06-22T11:47Z,"just test this and let me know if it solves the problem ;-) if it doesn't, make a new decent rip lol"
,charonB,2007-06-22T12:19Z,"@4X: I did my best. It was my first rip. The files, you sent, simply don't exist on my harddisk (p.e. agn_riv_tui.bmp). If you have another installer, that generates these files, than put it on RS so I can compare the two ones. 

Once again: All files, with ""riv"", that were in my main/Texture-Folder, are in the patch. Were are your extra-files from, 4X-AXG?"
,tomtom94,2007-06-22T14:03Z,"now it's ok,
just with the patch of charonB, it's work perfectly now for me

thanks;)"
,charonB,2007-06-22T14:30Z,"Superb, now I can go offline for the weekend with a happy face! :D

Have fun and au revoir,
charonB

(Thanks again, tomtom and 4X for your help!)"
,jurek123,2007-06-22T14:57Z,"4X-AXG - my problem is: houses from FlightRiviera AutogenPack they only flash on white and when I approach to them, they diesapper. Trees are OK. Write, how many files you have in : FlightRivieraBP \ Scenery and FlightRivieraBP \ Texture. Thx."
,borak stiller,2007-06-22T18:02Z,"19544 files in the texture folder before using the patch, which differs from the 11, 224 you mentioned.   Sounds like some of us don't need the patch and personally I haven't installed it because I don't recall any problems.  That's going by memory, haven't flown the area for some time"
,4X-AXG,2007-06-22T20:30Z,"houses that disappear? that's very weird, should not be a texture problem

anyway I do not have the original installer for this one..and I thank you (charon) for your efforts..next time when making a rip, select an empty folder to be sure you get every file that the installer installs..not your regular FS folder!

I understand this pack is now working properly so..thanks and till next time ;-)"

,FSHeaven,2007-07-09T18:58Z,"Hi CharonB. Have you got some Aerosoft AES 1.10 serials? For AESHELP 1.80.. haven't found any working here atm, only for older versions. Please help :/"

,charonB,2007-08-17T02:42Z,"Greetz, BritneysOrifice and all you others!

I dunno. Have no time to fly or experiment around these days. :/

A question:

Does the new version refuse to take older serials that are definitely blacklisted, or does it accept them (seemingly) in this new version, just to activate the blockage later on?

Maybe some of you could make some more tests like:"
,charonB,2007-08-17T02:45Z,"- Lobotomizing
- Reinstall of the original v1.90 (let's call it ""v1.900"", ok?)
- Adding only one serial at a time

... and report to me? 

@BritneysOrifice: I'll send you a serial, that was never posted anywhere, so you can work with it as a 100 percent-clean probe! :)

Greetz,
charonB

PS: ""New AESHelp with minor fixes"" Hehe, I love his humor... :D"
,charonB,2007-08-17T02:46Z,PPS: AES v1.900 can be found here: www.m3g4upl0ad.com/?d=LK3TWC58

OK, friends...
It's up to you from now on! ;)

Visit this thread from time to time and send the message, I sent you, out to those, who ask for it.

But please, don't seed it as a torrent or publish it publicly, 'cause that would break the neck for AES v2.0! :/
