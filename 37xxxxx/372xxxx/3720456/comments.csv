,mixfreakmark,2007-12-19T22:08Z,"I love your mix but ....
I'm not keeping it because it's saved in seperate mp3 files and I hate listening to a smooth mix like this one with ""plops"" between the tracks.
Is there any chance on getting a ""one file"" one perhaps with a cue file ?
Sorry for beeing so greedy ;-)
Anyway, great mix !"

It's worth the download just for how jrb has mixed the first four tracks together to become pretty much one extraordinary 18 minute industrial psytrance goa transcedent experience.
