,spacecoyote,2008-01-31T22:54Z,there are a little under 400 episodes of this hilarious show. does anyone know were to get them all.
,Harry Q Hammer,2008-03-23T18:42Z,"Yes, there are almost 400 Shin-Chan episodes but they are all in Japanese so they aren't much use to us English speakers, are they?

There are currently (March 2008) around 25 or so English dubbed episodes available, with more slated for broadcast on Adult Swim over the next several months.

People with access to Adult Swim (not me, sob) should keep an eye out for new episodes in the AS program schedule.

,dark_justice1986,2008-04-26T15:43Z,well I have adult swim and shin chan isn't aired anymore unfortunately.
,tweakn,2008-05-03T15:20Z,"Adult Swim rotates its lineup of shows about 4 times a year (about once a quarter), maybe more for x-mas specials and other holiday things. i saw shin-chan on just last week (on a weekend) so they are definitely still airing with recent themes and talk of clinton and obama etc. ^_^"
,professorgenius,2008-05-05T18:16Z,You can watch the new episodes online at adultswim.com. They often premiere new eps. Fridays at 6 pm eastern time. Anyone know where I can get downloads of the new season 2 material?
