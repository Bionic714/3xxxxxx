Barenaked Ladies (often abbreviated BNL or occasionally BnL) is a Canadian alternative rock band currently composed of Jim Creeggan, Kevin Hearn, Steven Page, Ed Robertson, Tyler Stewart, and formerly Andy Creeggan. They formed in 1988 in Scarborough, Ontario, at the time a suburb of Toronto. They are best known for their hit singles, "One Week", "Pinch Me", "If I Had $1000000", and "Brian Wilson", and for their light-hearted, comedic performance style. The band's trademark at live shows is humorous banter between songs, and improvised raps/songs, both of which are staples at virtually every concert.

Disc One is the seventh full-length album by Barenaked Ladies. It is a "greatest hits" compilation spanning BNL's first decade, featuring a version of almost every single they had released to that point. The album also featured two new tracks: "It's Only Me (The Wizard of Magicland)" and "Thanks That Was Fun", which was released as a single. It was released in November of 2001 to a warm commercial reaction (yet another US gold record). The title itself is a tongue-in-cheek reference to a line from the song "Box Set" off the album Gordon.
