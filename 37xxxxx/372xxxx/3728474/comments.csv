,Adarious,2007-06-30T21:27Z,"I forgot to include in the desc some instructions.  When you install, make sure to install the hardware version.  I also suggest installing the d3d patch afterward as well.  On xp systems, as win2k systems are incompatible, make sure you run dxdiag and disable all hardware sound acceleration prior to launching the game...or it will lock at main menu.  Set all executables to win95 compatibility.

Also ... if you intend to game to be playable on modern computers, you will need a slowdown program such as WinThrottle (free ..google it) ...and will want to reduce cpu speed down to around 1.5 to 1.8 ghz.  Use fraps to see your frame rate in game.  Your target is between 40 to 60 (max)."

,sHawTY83,2008-03-18T17:00Z,"Believe it or not, i'm playing this game on Vista Ultimate. XD

However there is one problem though.
The graphic. ZZZZZZZ. Because the graphic doesn't come out right.

It's like it doesn't go well with the graphic card.
Yes i've installed the 3D Patch, but it just doesn't work.

If only i could show to the uploader on what i'm talking about, maybe he could help me.

,PB_2006,2009-04-19T11:08Z,THANK YOU!!!!!!! I love Interstate '76 and I never played this expansion pack!!!!!!!
,bocmaxima,2011-11-03T07:13Z,"Thanks so much. I never played the pack, waiting for the entire game to download first. I am running W7 here, should be no problem, over the years I got proficient at running old games."
