This is the 3.5 to 1.5 downgrader that works with the lumines exploit. Includes step by step, easy to follow instructions that even the noobiest of noobs can understand. This package contains:

STEP 1: 3.5 UPDATE (with instructions for dummies)
STEP 2: 3.5 to 1.5 Lumines Downgrader (pre-configured with easy instructions)
STEP 3: 1.5 to 3.30 OE flasher (pre-configured flash-n-go with instructions)

I know that there is newer hacks than 3.30 oe, but I personally find 3.30 to be the most stable at the moment. If you disagree, you are more than welcome to install any other hack that you wish! Enjoy!
