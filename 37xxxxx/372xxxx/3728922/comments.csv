,Kvante,2007-07-02T22:23Z,When I have upgraded the firmware with the oe 3.30 - can I then anytime go back to std. 1.5 firmware and use DevHook?
,kurtandersson,2007-07-08T20:04Z,"Anyone tried this package, who can confirm that it works? /Kurt"
,Kvante,2007-07-09T10:35Z,"Kurt -> Yes, it works just fine. Playing Hot Wheels with no problems. Better than DevHook - I think. I hope I can downgrade it to 1.5 again if possible - no one answered so I took the chance.."
