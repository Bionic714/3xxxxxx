This is the volumen 1 of the my Cisco IOS collection.

The directories and files are:

* md5sums.md5: MD5Sum of all files.

* IOS: This directory contains the IOS downloaded directly
    of the Cisco web site. In the MD5 files are the
    description and properties of every IOS.

* Pix: This directory contains the IOS for Cisco Pix
    Firewall, v6.35 and v7.22. Also includes the
    documentation in PDF format and the Pix Device
    Manager. The file serials-pix.txt contains
    serials numbers of Cisco PIX 525 for PixEmu.

* Others: This directory contains the IOS collected
    from BitTorrent and Donkey networks.

Enjoy!!
