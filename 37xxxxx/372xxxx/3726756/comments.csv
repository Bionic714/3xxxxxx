,n1nj4Lo,2007-12-30T10:24Z,"rcs2003: WTF Are ya talking about it being in the zip file, There is no zip file... You and the uploader both are acting rather suspicious, Jesus if this were demonoid all the dumbasses who upload viruses would've been banned already and this stupid lil problem would've been weeded out...

Can anyone confrim that this is in fake a virus or not? Instead of jus rambling on like a moron about ""plz no virus plz no virus plz no virus"" that doesn't help answer the question at all, Only makes me further question it.... 

All in all once this is done I am gonna scan with ZoneAlarm and then Uncompress everything with 7-zip, And double check the uploaders other torrents to see if he has any other infected uploads.."

,ezboard,2008-03-04T00:28Z,Hmm I find it odd this is an EXE and not an ISO image...
,ezboard,2008-03-04T00:41Z,"#1 it's genuine
#2 why the fuck did I have to scan it? who the HELL would take the time making a 402 megabyte torrent to infect people?! 
#3: only retards spread viruses through unnecessarily large files, well only the super retards do, I mean all people who spread viruses are retards so I shouldn't insult retards by comparing them with what is basically a super retard."
,ezboard,2008-03-04T16:31Z,"PS: to uploader, NEXT TIME JUST PUT THE FUCKING ISO UP FOR TORRENT, instead of a winzip EXE file, people are suspicous of EXEs"
,liv242,2009-05-25T09:52Z,"ALL the torrents of the uploader are suspected!
 somebody clean this pest !"
