,vaughanman,2007-07-24T16:18Z,"i don't understand either how to use the .iso files because i am new to this and never come across this file extension before, could anyone help."
,AMD freak,2007-07-26T20:04Z,"Thanx again himod for this fine upload.

For all you n00bs...

Why use nero?
I used ImgBurn v2.32 to burn the .bin files dloaded from this torrent with no problems (works 100%).
I use NTI CD/DVD maker Platinum for most all of my burning needs. NTI is da shit fellas.... I don't use ANYTHING else unless I have to! I been using it for years and very rarely get a coaster to place my wet cans on like most of you fellas (from reading ur posts) who are using nero=shit, roxio=worthless shit etc...
I also use IsoBusterPro, ImgBurn and Alcohol 120% to view, read, or mount all .iso .bin etc... file formats. I use DVD Decriptor and CloneDVD2 for all my movie ripping/burning needs. I don't ever mess with daemon tools don't need it nor want it on my system.

Hopefully this will help you n00bs and peeps who don't know shit about PC, software, cracking, burning, or how to read and follow directions! lol

The freak has spoken"
,chris8186,2007-08-01T06:10Z,hey guys im not sure exactly how to get this software to work but do i extract all the .bin files first o burn them as is?
,Sillylarry,2007-08-03T20:28Z,i burned it to a dvd and nothing happens? what am i doing wrong? plz help
,jessohor,2007-08-24T20:39Z,"Please, some of those 984 who have downloaded it, add them to upload... I have been trying to download it for 3 or 4 days. Thanks for seeding!"
,jessohor,2007-08-26T18:53Z,"1) It apparently copies a lot files and the program intself, but the installation aborts, saying:

Setup.exe:
""A fatal error occurred during setup""

Then it stops. I can run the program, but it won't find a lot of things. This happens right after it says that it is installing the AVControlSDK (or something similar).

I recreated a CD, but even with the 2nd CD, it still generates the same problem.

2) The fonts problem is really sad. It does not produce the proper characters when creating titles."
,jessohor,2007-08-26T19:48Z,"I tried not making the CD, but installing with the Daemon tools and I got the same problem:

---------------------------
Setup
---------------------------
A fatal error has occurred while installing
---------------------------
Accept   
---------------------------

Of course, the program runs, but it can't capture (I suppose part of the installation, having to do with registry and finding the devices did not complete).

A workaround?"
,KopaKura,2007-11-05T13:56Z,"I'm so confused, I don't actually see any .iso files... So how do I mount it to Daemon tools?"
