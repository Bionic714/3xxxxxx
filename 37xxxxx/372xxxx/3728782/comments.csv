,mikemn,2007-06-30T23:56Z,thank you crejbi for stepping up to the plate for dopeman. This xp activation is a huge step for mankind.

,seanoxide3,2007-07-01T02:01Z,"hey dopeman, great release and I really enjoyed not having to buy vista.  I've played through most of the levels using the renaming work-around and found this fix and was very excited.  However, when i replaced the mf.dll in the halo 2 folder and put the other one in the windows/system32 folder, nothing changed.  I still get the ""please activate your product to continue playing"" message.  Any wise words of advice or should I continue renaming? :D"
,420dopeman,2007-07-01T02:10Z,"I'd have to say yes, although the renamer patch is not the most friendly way to play, It will certainly give you the same results in the long run. I for one never had a nag, so it's very hard for me to troubleshoot. (this is actually why I asked for someone else to shoot the nag) thanks again crejbi,... 
Perhaps try some shooting of your own, if your able to come with why, it may help others also.

greetz mate."
,seanoxide3,2007-07-01T02:30Z,"thanks for the rapid response,
i understand that you can't really troubleshoot, having not created this fix, but thanks for clearing it up for me :D

reading over your comment you make it sound like there's an actual patch that'll rename the maps, but apparently that isn't so (oh well, as it becomes difficult quickly to rename the maps and keep track which was originally which and what it should be)

cheers, Ian"
,seanoxide3,2007-07-01T02:31Z,"and now of course, I have to figure out why you didn't have the nag in the first place :)"
,420dopeman,2007-07-01T02:35Z,"oh there is a patch, its a series of .bat files that rename 3 maps at a time for you. Go to mininova and search this: 

Halo 2 Vista Single Player Patch

I've used them on XP and they work great. Just download and follow the instructions. I cant provide a direct link because tpb wont allow it.

,Fragmaster158,2007-07-21T21:50Z,"
 Greetings fellow pirates.

 There is indeed a new enemy amongst torrents and they are trying to control
 all good gaming torrents everywhere. Leeching and dumping data, not sharing
 a bit of data, which is making it near impossible to download many torrents.

 I have included a dopeman_blocklist.txt file. YOU MUST load this file to
 Peerguardian as an addtional blocklist -or- load the file to whatever means
 of IP blocking you have available to your BT Client.

 If you do not, you will simply be sharing data to these cowards and not other
 legit torrent users trying to download. 

 Please try to understand the importance of this. It must be used to begin
 saving game torrents everywhere. This is a new enemy. We must do our best 
 to fight back to preserve our freedom of sharing. 

 Please use the blocklist and share it anyway you can.

- First and for most this is for XP ONLY, it says it in the frickin' title!! Vista users I'm sorry, this won't work for you!

- Unrar the file

- Two folders are spawned: HALO2, SYSTEM32

- Copy the mf.dll that's in the SYSTEM32 folder and navigate to C://WINDOWS/SYSTEM32 on your system

- Paste mf.dll within the SYSTEM32 folder on your system

- Copy the mf.dll within the folder HALO2

- Paste the mf.dll file in the Halo 2 folder (where your game is installed from dopeman)

- It'll ask you to overwrite; accept it

- Relaunch the game

Notes: The game was laggy as hell when I restarted it despite being smoother than a babies ass just a few minutes previous. After a couple minutes, depending your system, it should return to normal framerate. 

Also you must have downloaded the dopeman torrent for Halo 2, else this won't work for you! My hat goes off to all who made this possible on XP!"
