,parzifal,2007-07-01T21:08Z,Why is this torrent so slow?  I'm getting like 50kBps for some reason but plenty of peers. 
,parzifal,2007-07-10T05:03Z,"I can't get this to work, with VLC, media player 11, mplayer, powerDVD, hdtv2mpeg, tsconverter - nothing seems to work.  The files are valid but the video just doesn't decode.  Any ideas?"
,parzifal,2007-07-10T05:51Z,KMPlayer seems to do it.  Good luck guys.
,oswald1234,2007-07-13T07:41Z,"dOWNLOAD THE kmPLAYER,,,USE THE older halli media splitter(if on windows XP) TAKES A BIG TITTED RIG....enjoy"
,scorchiooo,2007-07-17T01:56Z,If more people could play these torrents there would be more seeders. Sort it out HDTV China and learn how to encode.
,hurrafor,2007-07-21T19:26Z,"ABSOLUTELY works....you just have to do a little digging:

First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.

Install those and report back!"

Why is the sound of their voices so low?  PS: I have stereo sound. Do I need 5.1 to hear voices properly?"
,bebebebe01,2007-10-07T06:59Z,"FOllow hurrafor steps and you will hear it  and see it perfectly
After followinf hurrafor steps you can also use zoomplayer to watch this movie, KM player is also cool becuase you can play the complete movie , but the post -procesing and refresh frame rate is better with the zoomplayer!
Anyway both players work!
