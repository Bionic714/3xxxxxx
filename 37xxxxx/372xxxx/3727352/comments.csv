Great time to join this raging torrent, it's reached 82% !"
,divingfinatic,2007-07-04T01:57Z,Does anyone want the second DVD of this set?
,Interpolice,2007-07-04T04:50Z,"Yes!!!

Wait one more day for more people to finish this one, then announce.

Thanks for this, and all the bandwidth effort involved."
,Interpolice,2007-07-04T06:45Z,"Ugh, playback is screwed.

It played messed up (fragments, no sound, hard to get the menu to function) in a Pioneer DVD player.

On the Mac, DVD Player refused to play it because it didn't recognize the copy protection.

On the PeeCee, PowerDVD would not play it. I tried to pass it through Nero Recode, and it complained about copy protection too.

Any ideas here?

Does it work for anyone else? What are you using?"
,divingfinatic,2007-07-05T02:39Z,"Probably my fault: when i explored this DVD right after purchase, it ~APPEARED~ to be unencrypted VOB, BUF and IFO files.  So, I uploaded them without running them thru DVD Decrypter.
Now that INTERPOLICE says it isn't working, I apologize to those who wasted their time, and I'm uploading the second DVD of this package AFTER decrypting it with DVD Decrypter.
The second DVD is merely Candid Camera's first-ever broadcast in 1949; it's not a large file. Feedback, please, on how the second file plays for you people.
~IF~ the second one is playable, I will decode the main DVD and upload it.
Sorry again, for the pain in the ass."
,Interpolice,2007-07-05T04:50Z,"I tried to register INTERPOL, but it was taken. ;-)

I still think there was encryption, but I'm less sure.

Suddenly my burner is acting up. It's less than a year old, but I've burnt a lot of discs.

My system has started to slow to a crawl while burning, and a recent disc failed to verify.

Another one did burn and verify despite the slowdown. ""slowdown"" == it took 45 minutes to burn a regular DVD at 8x and 35 minutes for it to verify.

But the Candid disc did verify, and did not involve a slow system. Unfortunately I've deleted the disk files for it.

However, when I tried PowerDVD and Nero Recode, that was off of the hard disk files, which is why I still think there's an encryption problem.

It would be nice if other torrent users would report in, and I guess divingfinatic can burn a DVD himself and give it a try."
