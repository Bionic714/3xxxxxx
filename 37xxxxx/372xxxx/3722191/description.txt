The Royal Air Force at War: The Unseen Films 1940
Six original B&W films dating from 1940, probably the most important year in the RAF?s long and distinguished history. They cover warnings against stealing parts from downed aircraft, a look at RAF command structure and discipline, how downed airmen should deal with enemy interrogation, a really rare cartoon demonstrating the effects of oxygen deprivation on bomber crews and two exceptionally detailed films on gun turret drill for the Wellington Fraser Nash turret and the Boulton Paul Defiant turret.
