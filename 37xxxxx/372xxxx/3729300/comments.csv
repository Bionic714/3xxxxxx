,bbford,2007-07-01T20:52Z,"Verified app and keygen work, just follow the supplied instructions. I even registered it without any problems."
,Pauper,2007-07-02T22:18Z,"NO, the crack and keygen DO NOT WORK !!!!!"
,thekidgrif,2007-07-02T23:13Z,"Key gen is not a trojan!~ scaned it before i loaded it. Yes it works just fine  , some ppl just can't follow directions."
,LESTIME,2007-07-06T06:22Z,do u have to get rid of the other one before u install this one???
,dested,2007-07-14T08:03Z,This thing was easier to install than beating a dead baby to death. Very pleasant experience.
,gotme,2007-07-16T01:46Z,"dude, this thing works BEAUTIFULLY!  My virus scanner did keep going off but I ignored it... I already had the trial version installed so I just downloaded the keygen and the instructions, it was easy all I did was use the keygen and it works perfectly."
,desired18,2007-07-17T10:13Z,"oh my gosh i cant believe that the keygen actually worked and wasn't a virus!!!! i nearly cried with joy when i cracked it cause i've been trying forever to do that....so anyone in doubt dont worry the files are safe....

thanks so much i cant express my gratitude:)"
,ZOPP1699,2007-07-20T02:56Z,"Great download man, but I cant activate? Im using the Keygen but when I use the serial numbers an try to activate over the phone it says its not successful every time?"
,hppro,2007-07-22T22:04Z,there is a backdoor trojan in the keygen!!!!!!
,Pwnisher72,2007-07-23T22:14Z,"Sorry guys, but this definately has a trojan in it... but if you have norton or something else it is definately worth the risk."
,gaifboy,2007-08-06T01:47Z,Dammit! Is it just me who has the problem that you can't get throught the Setup? Nomatter what Adobe CS3 program I try to install I always stuck in the installation. 100% cpu?! Anyone has a similar problem or a solution?? 
,ViRtUaLvIrUs101,2007-08-07T22:39Z,OMFG!! Every time i try to download anything these fucking bitches always drop out and now there are no hosts! I was going at about 70 kb/s and the host left! Will someone please host this crap and stop being such a dick!
,Superjamppa,2007-08-11T22:41Z,"Keygen is very bad. it has somekinda Shark Torjan virus. I think its takes screenshots on your screen and send them... If somebody has been deleted it without format c: , tell it here."
,jakisbak,2007-08-26T17:53Z,"If you have Norton you can still use the keygen.
It just blocks the trogan and you can use the key normally.

It works fine if you can read!!!"
,samuscart,2007-10-03T23:42Z,this key gen does have a troj but just about any uptodate antivirus can delete it
,FlurreH,2007-10-09T15:26Z,6.2 kb/s lol....
