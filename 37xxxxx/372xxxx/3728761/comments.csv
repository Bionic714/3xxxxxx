BECAUSE there is sniffer malware detected by ZoneAlarm and many apps which doesnt let it come to your computer. If you have already downloaded 100% please check it with anti-virus or spyware app."
,vandelbuster,2007-12-16T11:15Z,"Hy odyn1982, I'm brazilian, so let us see if you can understand me:

I want so much Diskeeper 2008, Alcohol, Babylon (brazilian version with Dicionรกrio Michaellis) and Paint.net (installing in brazilian language). Would you please help me? I've tried to find these everywhere, but I couldn't, specially because they're shareware.
Almost forgeting, what about Nero Multilanguage? I've tried to make an adoon for Nero Lite 8.1.1.4 but I couldn't, btw it hangs when I try to add MP4 AAC + V2 (HE+PS) files to Music CD Creation. So I want so much something to teach me how to make personalized addon with the softwares I want (I like Recode). Thanks in advance!"
