,sometimese01,2007-07-26T06:44Z,"I tried installing this file and now it's saying that there is no license available for SPSS.  When I try to go on the Authorization Wizard the lock code now begins with a '4' instead of the '10' needed for the keygen. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times, but it sticks to the same lock code.   How can I get around this issue and make SPSS work again?  Someone... help, please!"
