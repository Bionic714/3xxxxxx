,Red42a,2011-12-15T19:34Z,"It would appear that there is only one seed for this torrent and that seed has a corrupt file.  Smith's Circle has one piece that's been unavailable for well over a year, even though scrape data shows a seed out there.  If that seed is the original, then this torrent will never complete.  We can only hope that it is not the original and that the original will eventually return."
