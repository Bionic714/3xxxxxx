Let see how it work."
,FadeToBlack,2007-06-24T10:11Z,"I was just wondering if anyone is interested in me uploading fsglobal 2008 for fs2004?
I don't know if anyone uploaded it before, but it's over 12gb (3dvds) so it will take some time to download for you guys."
,LeCl,2007-06-24T10:53Z,"Thanks FadeToBlack,
but I'm only interested of the FSX version
Do you have it?"
,goro_999,2007-06-24T12:44Z,"@FadetoBlack:

I would really be interested in that.

Any chance of splitting it up into several files (e.g. by continents) for those who don't want to download it all at once?"
,moomin71,2007-06-24T12:49Z,"FadeToBlack

,UndergrounD1337,2008-11-04T18:12Z,Hi anyone knows how to get this gauge work in PMDG 747 as well???
,phaezshre,2008-11-22T03:05Z,"Hey there, grfam.

I was wondering how you managed to configure your PMDG 737 to work with the Weather Radar. Now wait, don't get me wrong. I used your instructions to get it setup, and it works just fine. I'm trying to figure out how you knew what entries to make in the panel.cfg file and with what values so I can do the same with my PMDG 747.

Thanks again."
,dwlpl23,2009-03-17T09:18Z,"Hey good stuff but it doesn't work for me, i get a runtime error one of the .ocx files is missing/damaged/corrupt?  Just after ive click purchase, I agree and yes.  Any suggestions?"
,RID2,2010-02-23T07:45Z,"Word of warning to users of fs panel studio. There is a new gauge installed called NDWX.gau If you happen to try and load this gauge in fs panel studio, it will crash. so rename the gauge so that the gau isn't there until you done editing. "
