=============================================================================
This is the only torrent like it on the internet.

Instructions:
If you don't know what an ISO image is, google it. Then,
Burn to DVD and install, or mount the image with Daemon Tools or similar and install.
You'll need about 3.5 GB free hard drive for a complete install.

The FS:SDOE game is based on an open source engine that has seen continual additions and improvements from an enthusiastic community. This continuing development has truly allowed the game to achieve its full potential.

But, until now, installing this game with all the latest patches and new content required a great degree of expertise, if you could even FIND all the content and the proper instructions.

Contents:
This DVD ISO contains a special Custom Installer that will install the game
WITH NEARLY 10 YEARS OF MODS AND UPDATES INCLUDED.

Completely patched---install and play with full confidence.
Completely updated---tons of new high resolution content, missions and more.

This DVD also contains a WWI stand alone mod. With WWI & WWII versions installed, the player will have nearly 300 aircraft and vehicles to enjoy, with maps spanning all theaters of the Great War and World War Two.

Benefits:
This installer installs the whole thing, ready to play.
No need to run the game once before updating.
No need for the patch dance.
No need to install everything separately.
Five mouse clicks and you're done.
The installer even sets the Windows 98 compatibility mode for you!
