[T],Huggybaby,2007-06-28T01:52Z,"This torrent is the same as the other ones out there with the longer name ""Fighter Squadron SDOE Flight Simulator Combat Game for PC"". The title was truncated when I uploaded it here, maybe my mistake I don't know. This torrent also only has one tracker, if you want the multitracker version you can find it at one of the other sites like Meganova."

[T],Huggybaby,2007-10-14T06:56Z,"Most flight simulator games require a joystick, and it's recommended for this game.

You could probably fly with the keyboard or a mouse, ask the friendly folks at http://www.fightersquadron.com/"

,farmnut,2008-01-15T05:00Z,I downloaded the file. Did the unrar thing and burn the image to dvd.  When i click on install Fighter Squadron SDOE or WW1  I get a picture but it just sits there and does nothing. Can you tell me what I may have done wrong?
[T],Huggybaby,2008-02-03T08:46Z,"It sounds like things are almost working.
Are you using XP or Vista?"
,hyattandy,2008-10-06T16:43Z,I use a program called Daemon tools lite to mount the ISO image to a virtual disk... this then installs the package as it would if it was on a normal CD rom.
,telesien,2009-03-22T19:27Z,i also have the same problem. the installation alway freezes on 0% when installing boeing.htm. i have win xp and tried also changed compatibility settings. do you know what can possibly be wrong?
[T],Huggybaby,2009-05-05T22:03Z,"No, sorry. I'd ask hip63 at http://www.fightersquadron.com/."
