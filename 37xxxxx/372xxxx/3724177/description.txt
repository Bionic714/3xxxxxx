Google Spider Goats is an interactive, informative documentary/compilation that goes from the fraud that is known as the Federal Reserve to World Trade Center 7 in less than 50 minutes.A great film for waking up new audiences to how the United States of America's citizens are being subjected to massive deception. The film has been made for both new naive audiences with small attention spans, and truth deniers.

The film stars truth superstars Aaron Russo, Alex Jones, Steven E. Jones and Luke Rudowski. An abundance of important issues are touched on with the encouragement for the viewer to Google the subjects and read for themselves. The film has nothing to do with Spider Goats. It is titled Google Spider Goats to showcase just how many disturbing things are going on in America, unnoticed by the mass television-consuming public (i.e. crossing spiders with goats to create bullet-proof vests).

This is a VCD .nrg image file for burning CDs to play in a DVD player (VCD, video CD, is like DVD except it uses CD discs and so has lower quality) -- but the file can also be viewed directly on the computer by mounting it on a virtual drive. (Use this free software: http://www.magicdisc.net/)

A caveat: there are some images that I personally find disturbing, especially one picture of a baby (don't know the story about that baby although I have unfortunately seen the picture before so maybe the story is known to "everyone else")
