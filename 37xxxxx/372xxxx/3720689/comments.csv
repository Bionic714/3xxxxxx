can't wait to get this album from sotre but unfortunately seems it'll take some time till it arives here so would be really really happy if you could do it :)"
,Mervik,2007-08-26T12:04Z,What's wrong with 128 kbps? It sounds good to me. Even 320 kbps sounds the same to me or do you really see some kind of difference?
,bionic00,2007-10-23T19:26Z,tankx!!
,Dador,2008-08-27T17:18Z,awesome torrent. thanks 
,zingerdei,2008-09-18T21:55Z,"The difference is that 320 takes up 10 fucking times as much space. 128's fine. Damn, you're getting something for free, you shouldn't be complaining."
,Kassoriou,2008-10-13T03:43Z,Seed please!
,nibaini,2008-12-08T13:51Z,"Thanks for the upload, I prefer this size better since i have so much crap on my drives I dont need anything else huge."
,MASK.13,2009-01-13T04:23Z,"Yes, it's free. STOP BITCHING!"
[T],PeteSapai,2009-06-21T12:38Z,"First: 320/128 = 2.5 (not 10)
Second: He's not bitching. 128k sounds like crap to some people (like me). And just because it's free doesn't mean it can sound like crap. (Would you eat free food that _tastes_ like crap?)"
,DEC_42,2009-09-04T01:33Z,"What PeteSapai said, seriously. Just because your sound equipment is crap, and you can't hear the canyon of difference that 320kbit/s music makes, compared to 128kbit/s.

I'd rather take 224 or 192kbit/s than 128kbit/s as it distorts immensely when played loudly (as a ton of people, including myself, do). If you're using stock Apple earbuds or cheapo Coby headphones, then you have no right to say that 128kbit/s music sounds the same as 320kbit/s,

FLAC and every other lossless format, however, is useless, unless you're playing your music over rock concert grade speakers... (PA systems)"
