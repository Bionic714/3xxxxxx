A famous left-wing satirical comedy about two ex-convicts, one of whom works his way up from salesman to factory owner, where he oversees a highly mechanised operation where the workers are reduced to mere automatons. Blackmailed over his past, he joins up with his old cellmate, and the pair take to the road as tramps. It is frequently acknowledged as the inspiration for Chaplin's 'Modern Times.
