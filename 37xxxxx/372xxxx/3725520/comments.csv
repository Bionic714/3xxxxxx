kerouac_rj,

First, thanks for torrent. Been looking for this movie, which is supposed to be great. I look forward to watching it.

Second, please *turn off superseeding*.

This is how superseeding (or initial seeding) works: The seeder chokes all requests for a non-unique file piece.

In practice, this means the seeder does not repond to any requests until *all* leechers have *all* the available pieces. That is, a leecher with 80% of the file can't get another piece until *everyone* has 80%.

It works ok for a small number of leechers, under 5, maybe up to 10 if you have a really fast seeder and 1 or 2 fast leechers.

Otherwise, for larger numbers of downloaders, it slows the network down considerably.

yes, please check off the 'initial seeding' box. the hole thing will be faster then. i promise, that i will seed the movie afterwards for some days...
thanks

again, kerouac, do you believe that anybody will seed this file after waiting 4 days to download it? is it your comprehension of democracy, that we all can't go forward with downloading, before everybody else has the same procentual stage? Is it not an absurd wasting of electricity when 22 Leechers have to put on their machines for so long?

please answer this questions.

thanks."
,sonne210,2007-06-29T22:21Z,"now, i finished the download, and i will NOT seed.
because of your restrictions."
