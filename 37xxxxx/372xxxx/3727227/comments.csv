Regards."

I am seeding it!"
,throwing_wheel,2010-02-02T08:58Z,"Thanks for keeping the seeding alive, although barely.  Two seeders are up but between them I am getting 7 kb/sec.  Come on, guys, open it up.  I've got 25% more to download.  Give it an unlimited upload and I can be done overnight."
,sebblewich,2011-07-10T19:08Z,Would a few kind souls please increase their upload speed? I'm dying here.
,Pandaneitor,2012-06-13T08:24Z,Can somebody please seed? I'm stuck at 0.7%  =/
