Notes:

This is one of the Dead\'s best live releases in recent years, iffering a great cross section of their material form the previous years. The band is in great form, the set offers more than 3 hours of music and the sound quality is second to none.
After hearing this, you should go out and buy it, ut us a stellar release from the pioneers of the jam band!
ENJOY!
