,BimBom,2007-07-11T19:44Z,"Actually, it says the fucker is damaged

Hannibal.Rising.NORDIC.PAL.DVDR-GENESIDE\geneside-hr.r01: The archive is either in unknown format or damaged


Who ever likes to pack the shit in RAR files, i could dig his eyes out and feed them to my pet pigs.

Just kidding :P I would eat them myslef :D

 What good is rar files for anyway? It doesnt make the download smaller OR faster so much that it would make any difference. ... plus, my seeding ends when i have to unpack the files cause im not keeping 4,3Gb files in double on my hard drive.

Upload ISO images, ready for buring!!!
