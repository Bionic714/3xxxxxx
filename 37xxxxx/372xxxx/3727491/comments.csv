,snoopyhead101,2009-04-13T18:55Z,There is a lot of static in the beginning and the sound is way off from the actual speaking.
,Neverb0rn,2009-04-15T07:02Z,I didn't notice any static or whatnot in the begining or anywhere in the movie. I'm using VLC and the movie is perfect A10V10. Thanks for the great UL!

,TheQw,2010-01-29T10:32Z,"Use VLC for better audio incorporation. Sound lagging behind actual speaking is usually due to an overloaded memory - stop some programs or buy a better PC.
