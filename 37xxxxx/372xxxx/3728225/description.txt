--- Description --------------------------------------------------------

A stripped down and tweaked version of Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow, 

only containing the Versus mode and english translation. Great for LAN-

parties!




--- Instructions -------------------------------------------------------

To play, run Systemshadowstrike_static_retail.exe.




--- Tip ----------------------------------------------------------------

For a totally different experience, try setting the "MinDesiredFrameRate" 

in the SystemDefault.ini file to 60 (default is 35). This gives the game 

a whole new dimension, but it has a downside. The "sidestep speed" will 

still be moving at a 35 fps rate, meaning it will feel like you're 

walking against an invisible wall when sidestepping. I reccomend you test 

it anyway.
