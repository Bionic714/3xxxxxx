,Metal2Liquid,2008-01-09T12:45Z,"I've tried too get splinter cell mutliplayer for EVER!

i first tried too get double agent, i downloaded it, it took 4 days. And when it was done it turns out that the PC version is messed up and cant be played.

I figured id try Chaos theory, later i figured out that if i download chaos theory from anywhere ill get a specific virus

now im trying Pandora tomorrow and i havent found any problems with that game! SO PLZ F*CKING SEED! UR MY LAST HOPE OF GETTING TOO PLAY SPLINTER CELL!!!"
,Metal2Liquid,2008-01-09T13:05Z,"thanks for seeding.

but i got 1 question: why does it take 6 days for a torrent at the size of 75 MiB?!"
,HackerBuB!,2008-01-22T18:10Z,Becouse i was the only one seeding and i didnÂ´t have this one so high on the priority list =)
