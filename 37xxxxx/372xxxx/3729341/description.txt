===Notes===
I'll encode the ads and credits at a lower bitrate in my next release.

Don't bitch about the ads. They're there for a reason.

I think this is categorized as PDTV because of the source chain. Please tell me if it is not.

If you have any idea how to improve this encode, please tell me how to fix it. (esp the darkness issue)

Don't expect this program regularly as I'm just doing test encodes. My encoding time on this thing was 6 hours so there is no way I could get this out daily in a timely fashion.

Support your local PBS Station by making a contribution or by purchasing their DVDs. To help speed up future releases, please try to seed this torrent as much as possible. Thanks.
