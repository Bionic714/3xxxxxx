In the Year 2889 (1967)

    * Shot in 16mm and color and used to pad out one of American International's television syndication packages.

    * AIP gave director Larry Buchanan the script for _Day the World Ended (1956)_ to use for this film. The result is an almost line-for-line remake.

    * This film is not set in the year 2889; it is not futuristic in any way. There is a Jules Verne short story called ""In the Year 2889"", and presumably this film was named after the short story.

    * After the success of their earlier motion picture Master of the World (1961), American International Pictures had planned to make another film based on a Jules Verne story, ""In the Year 2889"", however this project was later shelved. A few years later, when Larry Buchanan was given the script of AIP's earlier film Day the World Ended (1955) to remake, a new title was needed. Since AIP had already registered the ""In the Year 2889"" title, it was tacked onto the Buchanan film."""
