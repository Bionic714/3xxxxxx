http://tovid.sourceforge.net
One bug: if using english you need to start tovidgui from command line with:
LC_ALL=en_US.UTF.8 tovidgui
as knoppix sets LC_ALL=""C"" which doesn't work.
New version will be uploaded shortly
with updated man page for todisc as well.

,grepero,2007-06-30T21:49Z,"Heh, can't edit your own comments it seems.  I meant to say a new version is on its way, so i've removed this one for now.  ( after waiting for someone to finish downloading the whole thing at 2 KB/PS :P
