The Who is an English rock band that first formed in 1964 and grew to be considered one of the greatest and most influential bands in the world. They have been described, moreover, as "possibly the greatest live band ever." The primary lineup consisted of Pete Townshend, Roger Daltrey, John Entwistle and Keith Moon.

The Who rose to fame in the United Kingdom with a series of top ten hit singles (including the celebrated "My Generation") and top five albums, beginning in 1965 with "I Can't Explain". They first hit the top ten in the USA in 1967 with "I Can See For Miles". The 1969 release of Tommy was the first in a series of top five albums for the group in the USA.

Keith Moon died in 1978, after which the band released two more studio albums, Face Dances and It's Hard, with drummer Kenney Jones, before officially disbanding in 1983. They reformed on several occasions during the 1980s and 1990s to perform at special events such as Live Aid and for tours such as the tour celebrating their 25th anniversary and the 20th anniversary of Tommy. The band focused on live performance during this period. In 2000, the three surviving members began to discuss the possibility of recording an album of new material, but Entwistle died in 2002, which delayed recording. The two remaining members, Townshend and Daltrey, continue to perform as The Who. Their most recent studio album, Endless Wire, was released in 2006.
