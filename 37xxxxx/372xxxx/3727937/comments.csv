,FTW2000,2007-08-28T22:37Z,Another bypass from that MF stephen MF king??!! In my youth I sworn two things. Never read tabloit papers and second not see or read nothing wich is based or written of that SOB (the shining was nice though. the movie. the book sucked coloureds males organs in kubic inches). Let me guess. The frigging hotel is built on indian sacret church yard and the visitors get hauntings and evil spirits again?  
,rudiwibble,2007-08-28T23:06Z,"actually FTW2000, you're wrong. It was actually an Indian sacrifical chambers site where they used to sacrifice goats."
,FTW2000,2007-08-29T03:28Z,"Button line: is it any god or is it all about kitchen utilities possest of indian evil spirits or what ever again? Trucks??!! A evil pressmachine??? Evil toasters(they havent manage to make a movie of that novell yet eller för den svenska publiken: Stig MF Helmer möter Stephen MF king. Eller hans kneg på brödrostfabriken möter helt nya dimensioner eftersom dom bygde fabriken på helig indian mark. !""#""###!!!#!""#!!! eller anfäckt a och annama era sjölhalade vårtsvin! "

,Philcore_The_Loud,2007-09-10T23:45Z,"Holy shit, really nice ghost movie. Awesome acting, great effects, and the quality is definitely acceptable: video and sound 8-9 out of 10. Worth the download anytime. Thanks a lot for the up Ltt_Fr1! Awesome work."
,rspoppi,2007-09-12T17:04Z,"Right, mates, thanx for ur comments. Really appreciated.
Ltt_fr1, cheers for the UL.
Take care u all."
,rspoppi,2007-09-13T19:29Z,"so. my feedback: quality is scheiße, blured n inconsistent. How can some guys give it 8, 9 or 10? It's close to Mr Magoo or Pink Panther in the early 80's. A VCR's better.
I'd say 5v und 6a. Nevertheless, thanx 4d effort."
,substeve,2007-09-14T02:11Z,"Great movie, really liked the sample file you included as I could see what I was getting before dl the whole movie.
