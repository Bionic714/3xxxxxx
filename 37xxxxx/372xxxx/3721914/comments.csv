,charnaal,2007-06-24T04:41Z,"Zamorak1:
XP patch works as far as im aware,
and yes, you can use bots in a lan game.

thimiesama:
this isnt the game, its only the crack, but yes, it works fine, im playing it with friends over the net using hamachi."
,silvertearx,2007-06-24T05:39Z,"before people start asking if they can play 
with people online NO
but you can play with friends on lan
use hamachi
just like charnaal said.
use goole to find it & how to use it
thx for the upload"
,silvertearx,2007-06-24T18:52Z,"also note that you need  
256 MB NVIDIA 6800 / ATI Radeon X800  ( min )
to play. anything lower will cause the screen to go
pink & orange just a heads up."
,Jibbergibber,2007-06-24T19:30Z,"This is the Shadowrun game that recetly came out for vista and xbox 360? Ive been looking for a crack for this game and keep finding files for a shadow run game for the snes.

If this is the sadowrun game for vista/xbox360, can somebody please tell me how to get this crack to wrok please."
,charnaal,2007-06-25T12:04Z,"Jibbergibber:
Yes this is the crack for the shadowrun game recently released on windows, all the instructions you need are contained in the file (you just copy the files from the rar into your shadowrun directory and delete one file)"
,adonais420,2007-06-25T15:22Z,please mann seed please!!!

I bought the shadowrun CD from a shop, however, for some reason my pc cannot read the cd. So what i did was create a virtual copy of my CD using magiciso.

I installed shadowrun, I then went to C/..../shadowrun, i deleted the 1 file it told me to and copied the other two crack files into the folder.  But wheh I tried to play shadowrun without the CD it wont let me. Is there anything i need to do? Do i need to install the crack files somehow. 

IF someone gold give me a more in-depth explanation of what to do id greatly appreciate it (im not very good with computers.)"
,charnaal,2007-06-25T20:09Z,"Jibbergibber:

Thats very strange, I installed the game from an ISO image, deleted the 1 file and copied across the 2 files it tells you to and it worked fine for me.

Are you playing under XP or Vista?
and are you copying the 2 dll files directly into your shadowrun install dir?"
,EternalDecay,2007-06-25T22:15Z,is there a keygen or something cause it keeps asking for cd key
,charnaal,2007-06-26T00:37Z,"EternalDecay:
If you have installed the crack the correct way
(like it says in the nfo) the game will not ask you for a cd-key."
,EternalDecay,2007-06-26T02:41Z,"""If you have installed the crack the correct way
(like it says in the nfo) the game will not ask you for a cd-key. ""

I have installed the crack following the directions in both xp and vista, still asks for cd key...  I even tried uninstalling/reinstalling in both just to make sure."
,charnaal,2007-06-26T10:30Z,"EternalDecay:
Thats really strange, I dont really know what to say as the crack worked fine for me the first time.

Go into your installation folder and delete the srsw_shadowrun.dll.
Copy srs_shadowrun.dll and srsx_shadowrun.dll to your installation folder.

This is what I did and the game worked fine."
,Haggis1,2007-07-01T16:10Z,"Does this prevent the game from crashing? I have already got the game to work in XP, but it allways crasher after a few minute:("
,lqd886,2007-07-01T19:01Z,"The instructions say to install then go to installation folder.  I'm running xp and it wont let me install it.  I created an iso image deleted the 1 file copied over the 2 dll files and the xp files and it still says cant install cause of os.  And it wont let me run the game.

I'm so frustrated, what am I doing wrong?"
,Sawsitjez,2007-07-03T07:31Z,"I copied the folder from the DVD (X:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Shadowrun) and installed the crack according to the instructions, but it is saying that the ""application is incorrectly configured, please reinstall"".  Anyone know how to fix this?"
,charnaal,2007-07-05T04:13Z,"lqd886:
If you want to run it from XP, you dont install it at all,
go to your DVD-Drive:\program files\Microsoft Games\

on the install DVD, and copy the Shadowrun directory to the folder you want to put it in,
like c:\games\shadowrun, then you copy over the xp files."
,livewire86,2007-07-09T00:02Z,"charnaal:

You said you are playing it w/ friends via hamachi.. how'd you get this to work? 
I've tried with every person I've come in contact w/ over the Hamachi shadowrun networks, and so far, it hasn't worked for any of us. None of us can see each other's games.
I've search countless times on google and made several recommended (but unsuccessful) changes to my settings, and had the people I was trying it with duplicate them.
Did you have to set any special settings to get it to work?"

yep, the same thing is happening for me. Has anyone found a fix for this?"

Thanks to Razor1911 and the Seeder"
,Scinerd,2007-10-07T19:34Z,"Here's a question:

I bought this when I had Vista so O have a valid CD Key.  I loathe Vista so installed XP instead.  Will this let me play using my valid CD Key and my valid Live account? 

Anyone?  Bueller?"
,Szimen,2007-11-24T20:39Z,"When you aply the crack for XP, it says copy the xp folder to the install directory. That means do not copy the folder itself so you get shadowrun\xp\crack.file(s), but shadowrun\crack.file(s)"

,Spectre4802,2008-09-29T11:47Z,"i forgot to mention, im running XP and have deleted the files and replaced it with the other two and the other three files that the game whined about needing. i have also met system requirements for the game. i have not created an ISO image. hope this helps a bit more.

many thanks in advanced."

This iso should provide the crack even though its latest version [http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3732741/ShadowRun___XP_Crack]"
