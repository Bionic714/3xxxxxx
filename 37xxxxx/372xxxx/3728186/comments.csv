,manfaceguyman,2008-05-31T16:41Z,"Thanks for uploading, but utorrent refuses to download and claims ""invalid torrent file"". What the hell? "
,Pike84,2008-06-12T22:29Z,"Sheesh.. I'm shocked, that this stuff isn't more popular! ""In Sides"" is a classic, and it'd deserve a couple of dozen seeders all by itself.. and these are some ancient downloads from Napster?? (who the hell even remembers that...).

Put a comment here, and I can share it myself, if you're interested (and others too, since I have them all original). Anyone should hear this music :)."
