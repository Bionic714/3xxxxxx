http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mGZLUMiuTs

My goal is to get the teaser viewed by as many as possible so that I can convince a couple of sponsors so that I get to do 14 episodes later this year and then release them, for free, all over the world, once a month.

My main goal to do that is to get it up on the front page of You Tube.

If you liked what you saw and want to see more there is actually something you can do to make that come true.

Log-in to your You Tube account and send a mail to the http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=YouTube user and tell them that you think that they should put up the teaser on the front page.

That's it.

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!"

,hedetoft,2007-07-30T14:55Z,"Just wanted to let you know about the premiere of Save AndrĂŠ Hedetoft - Production Diaries!
From now on there will be a new production diary every/every other week during the 
wild quest to realize my dreams of becoming the obvious geek movie director 
by making a low budget independent superhero-Internet-series!

It will not be the usuall behind the scenes pr bullshit. 
It won't even look that good. 
Instead I will bring you the brutal truth. 
The things you usually don't ever get to see. 
It will be funny, tragic, ordinary and wildly inspiring.

Watch the first episode over at:
