I /will/ keep seeding... Once we have at least another seeder, speeds should improve in leaps and bounds!"

,Arnald,2007-10-22T20:13Z,"hi, im new at this stuff, wat is lossless?"
,Mdj71,2007-10-27T09:29Z,"Lossless is when you Rip a CD without the loss of soundquality that happens when you rip to MP3 for example.

FLAC takes the data from the CD bit by bit whereas MP3 (especially low bitrates - 128+ Kbps) compresses the data."
