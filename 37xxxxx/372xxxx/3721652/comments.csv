I'm currently seeding the dubbed series, because I like it soo much, but I'd really like to stop reading subtitles for once. I can't believe how much japenese I've learned from watching them. It'd really be appreatiated if someone would up the series in english. I'd rip the 1st volume when I go out to buy it, but I need to know a better ripping process than the one I currently use. Mine turnout to have too much resolution and therefore file space."
