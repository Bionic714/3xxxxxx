This another great sounding show i recently dug out and played again after a long time its partly soundboard
the odd thing seems to that the last 2 tracks on discs one and the last 2 on disc 2 seem to be identical
but the artwork which is included has them both listed.
I have left them as is you can decide if you want the tracks twice!

Anyways disc1 track 1-11 are digital aud
disc 1 tracks 12-14 and disc 2 tracks 1-13 are soundboard

This is great sounding show none the less

disc 1
farther on
i'm alive
intro
your bright baby blues
under the falling sky
for a dancer
jamaica say you will
something fine
barracades of heaven
i'm the cat -encore-
the times you've come
for everyman

disc 2
world in motion
lives in the balance
the reel jesus
too many angels
late for the sky
light & virtues
black & white
i am a patriot
redemption song
sleeps dark and silent gate
the pretender
the times you've come
for everyman
