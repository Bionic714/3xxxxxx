[V],Subzero!,2007-07-12T22:29Z,"why?.... because the music is 4 times bigger as the complete game, just btw. music has nothing got to do in race games(my opinion) car sounds are enuff, music in games like mario karts is ok (my opinion).... "

Special Info Note:

Some virus-scanner recognize the header of a packed exe (start-game.exe)

as a lame virus, (coz it's thebyte by byte check error of 'em!.) 

Its almost certainly a false positive alert from overly protective heuristics

you can read more about in your VirusTool-Manual or VirusTools-WebSite!.

(heuristics). thank you for reading!."
,hellom8,2008-03-13T19:17Z,"Problem..when i start the game it stops at ""Loading"""
,kelsonphilo,2008-07-17T06:47Z,"So, I'm loving this so far, even without the music, but I'm only getting Tezla's cube track!  It all goes black when I try League mode.  Any idears?  Thanks for your time."
,gegueure,2008-10-27T23:43Z,"i also hang on a flashing loading screen, i tried compatibility modes but it wasn't better.
i don't even reach the main menu or anything, just that flashing loading screen.
Do you know a sloution?"
,theonlyangel,2009-06-12T08:13Z,"it's just a waste of time, it goes black after some challenges or when trying to play league mode so i guess it's incomplete

@ subzero, 
don't you have the complete ISO file? "
,killerinstinc01,2010-07-01T03:27Z,dude upload some good torrentz  your games are no seeders and just full of shit
