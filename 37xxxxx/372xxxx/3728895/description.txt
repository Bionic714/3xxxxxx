CMT Crossroads brings together two of the most powerful voices in all of music with the pairing of rocker Pat Benatar and country star Martina McBride.

With seven platinum records, three gold records, four Grammy Awards, two American Music Awards and millions of fans worldwide, Benatar has established herself as one of rock's enduring legends. Along with her husband, guitarist Neil Giraldo, Benatar's smash hits include "Hit Me With Your Best Shot," "Promises in the Dark," "We Belong" and "Heart Breaker." Benatar also made television history in 1981 when her first video, "You Better Run," was the first video by a female and the second ever to run on the groundbreaking cable upstart MTV.

For the last decade, McBride has won over legions of fans with her powerful voice and moving lyrics. With six No.1 hits, the platinum-selling McBride has made her mark with songs like "Wild Angels," "Valentine," "Independence Day" and "Blessed." McBride has received three CMA female vocalist awards, a Grammy and two CMT Flameworthy Video Music awards. Her 2003 album, Martina, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard country album chart.
