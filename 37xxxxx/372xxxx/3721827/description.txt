
Mistaken Identity Audio Book

Lisa Scottoline (Author), Haydn Gwynne (Narrator)
With her sequence of novels about the Philadelphia law firm
 headed by defence lawyer Bennie Rosato, Lisa Scottoline has 
distinguished herself with suspenseful, violent action and sharp, 
intelligent courtroom scenes. Mistaken Idenitity sets the seal
 on that reputation. Bennie has always known that there was
 some mystery about her father--of whom she knows nothing 
but his name--and her dying mother is unable to tell her anything. 
That is until she takes the case of her life. 
...Summoned to prison by a woman on a capital 
charge of murder, Bennie shockingly discovers that she has
 a twin sister, Alice Connolly. But Bennie isn't entirely 
convinced that she's her sister or that she's innocent of 
murder...Scottoline evokes the moral dilemmas of the 
defence lawyer, the hothouse violence of a women's 
prison and the intellectual excitement of putting together 
a defence from scratch.
