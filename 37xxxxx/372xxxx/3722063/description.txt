[Release Notes]

In a series that can truly be labelled golden, and which even has it's
own world renowned abbreviation ITWT, a new volume is being heralded:
In Trance We Trust volume 12
With Volume 12 Gielen proves that compiling and mixing an album such as
this, is more than just superficially fusing mainstream trance-hits
Leave it to Johan Gielen to leave his mark fully and clearly on this volume
He again shows himself as a master in both selecting as well as mixing
Not many deejays can deliver a compilation and still leave their mark but
Johan Gielen does just that
In doing so, Volume 12 has become a blend of full fledged trance
productions and living proof that - if done the right way - a compilation
can be a lot more than the sum of tracks
To celebrate the release of this In Trance We Trust CD, Johan Gielen will
play on June 15 at Patronaat, Haarlem and on June 16 at El Sombrero, Reusel
He will be accompagnied by Phynn, who mixed the previous edition

Enjoy!
