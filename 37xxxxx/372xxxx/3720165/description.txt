This site contains images of this really cool airport.

3 airports: St. Maarten (TNCM), St. Barts (TFFJ), Saba (SABA/TNCS) 
3 Islands covered with Photoscenery, custom Autogen and Mesh 
Animated AI-Ships ranging from Windsurfers to Cruiseliners. 
Animated car traffic. 
Numerous details on Maho beach / St. Maarten approach

Make sure that your scenery complexity and autogen sliders are on very dense to experience the airport in all its glory. I use World of AI for airline traffic. I have found that American Airlines frequently flies in and out of that airport. Have traffic sliders set to 100% and its all good.

Have a good day.
