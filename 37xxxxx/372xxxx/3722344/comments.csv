,Wonderstuff,2007-06-24T17:18Z,"fredster: well, you seem to be fucked already. Well and done. That's probably why you let your asshole speak when you write, I presume you're writing with your colon. Must be a sticky keyboard."
,Wonderstuff,2007-06-24T17:20Z,"And, just to underline how braindead you are, when you write about IP-addresses being tracked: they can do that already. And here's a thought fredster fuckface: what if they track you? Oh my God, didn't think of that, did you? Well, just follow the sawdustremains from what little brain/asshole you have left, it's a pretty obvious trail."

,aba79,2007-06-27T12:37Z,"Dude, if it says 'TS' somewhere, it means telesync and that it is copied from a screen (cinema). To be crystal clear; Unless you're not a retard, TS is not something you wanna download.."
