,blaffe,2007-07-02T00:45Z,ive heard some rumors that the PC version of Halo 2 is pretty bad? is it true`? or will it be worth the while to download it.... of course to save time.. download Dopeman release;) but... is the game any good?
,420dopeman,2007-07-02T00:54Z,"I aint gonna bullshit ya mate, I can't stand the game myself, but like most, I just had to check it out, especially on XP.

Maybe you will like though, I'm just not in to sci-fi myself. 

cheers mate."
,techmannie,2007-07-02T01:27Z,THESE ARE GREAT!!! It s like cheating. I love to cheat. You can play any map ANTIME. NiCe maTe.
,blaffe,2007-07-02T04:58Z,ive never really played a sci-fi game.. guess this one is not a good start...  who knows what will happen.. i maybe love the genre o probaly not ...
,blaffe,2007-07-02T04:59Z,gosh.. need to check my spelling :(
,MrStabby,2007-07-02T21:42Z,"I found out a better solution,

1. Place the 32kb XP patch/Wow loader MF.dll in C:\Windows\System32 
2. Replace the MF.dll in your Halo2 folder with the 4kb Razor1911 crack.
3. Win.

The combo works wonders for me :)"
,420dopeman,2007-07-02T22:25Z,"Just to make it even easier that's the same as the below, I believe:

,sadrax,2007-07-03T14:24Z,"Hey guys i dont get it! if i want to play lvl 13 then i must start lvl 10?
but before i must start the batch file and when im in the select for level menu i must push ""ENTER"" on the batch file or what`???
or i just have to start batch file then select lvl 10 and i will play autom. lvl 13`?
THNX"
,crebban,2007-07-03T20:44Z,great fix. but how the h*ll are u supposed to know what number the level your on has? They just have names ^^ Pls help? ;D
,420dopeman,2007-07-03T21:48Z,"Ok, to the best of by knowledge the levels go just as numbered on the .bat files. 
SO, if you want to play levels 13,14,15. Just double click on the corresponding .bat file while its in the maps folder. Then , leave the dos box up, and start the game. Then choose to 'select level' from the in game menu. Choose 'heretic' from the menu and 'heretic' will actually load as level 13. 
You then can play 13,14,15 all in sequence just from running that one file. 

greeetz mates."
,crebban,2007-07-03T22:32Z,"yeah, i get that part. BUT how do i know WHAT level ""level 13"" is? Like the name of it."
,sadrax,2007-07-04T20:25Z,you should really count it from first level to 12(the max of permanent fix)
,sadrax,2007-07-04T20:27Z,WHY DIDNT U SAY THAT EARLYER??????????????????? I THINK I love u! (not in a gay way lol)
,sadrax,2007-07-04T21:21Z,"jup jup 
Now i have a problem that has made me think o do something wrong :

I load the 13-14-15 batch file then i load the in game the Heretic map and it like loads but then it ends throws me out like finito to the desktop and nothing no new map.
Ive tryed the thing with the 4-5-6 batch and nothing happens .. why is that? 
Ps im an XP user"
,sadrax,2007-07-04T21:24Z,Another thing i thought i screwd something up but then i RE- extracted it cause it urs RIP version and tryed to do the same thing (Installed the permanent fix and intalled the batch files) and loaded the batch  13-14-15 and then in game the heretic map and Still nothing happens .... what do i do wrong?

,lalala1,2007-07-22T06:39Z,"Alternatively, if you are just having problems with level 12 asking for the DVD (or want to go back and play it, download and run microsofts Process Monitor while the level is loading. Somehow this causes the level to load correctly on most machines (alright my sample is 2...mine and the poster on some forum)--perhaps due to the overhead lagging the DVD check until it times out.

And don't forget to download the other fix for the activation nag (if u have it)."
,jygi-.-,2007-08-07T01:34Z,"PLS DOPEMAN, COULD YOU TELL ME HOW CAN I PLAY THE LEVEL 12,13,14,15 ETC. I DONT GET THE .BAT FILE THINGY :( please help"

,chimpakawanzelu,2007-12-02T07:04Z,"Dopeman: you rule!! - thank you
""Someone"": thank you as well - you f'n rule too.

Vista users: this works great on Vista 32bit.  Be sure to download the HALO 2 ACTIVATION WORKAROUND.  Don't mess with the ACTIVATION FIX - didn't work for me.  Also be sure to disable your firewall and user account control before unraring the ACT WORKAROUND.  Those two things are usually the problem in Vista op.systems.  Cheers!!"

Ive done exactly, word for word and then some for getting it work, followed to directions completely. there is something missing here, because others have had it work.

,TayZZ,2009-10-19T22:56Z,"I used this fix and it kinda worked... I am using Vista 64-bit. I ran the first batch file (play 4, 5, and 6). Then I started the game, then I minimized the game and pressed enter on the batch file. Then i opened Halo 2 back up. I click to play Heretic like the description says and it puts me on the 'Oracle' mission to escape the infested labs!! WTF, how do I just get to the outskirts mission?"
,icmruggs,2009-10-23T01:07Z,"Thanks!  This torrent worked as described. ( Winxp with SVC pk2 on a newer mid-high end computer).  I tried your other ""fix"" but had no luck.  I am grateful for you getting this workaround uploaded.  I would have bought this game if it didn't require an OS 'upgrade'...Thanks again!"
