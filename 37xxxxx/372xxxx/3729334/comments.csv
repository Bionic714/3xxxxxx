,Networx,2007-07-01T07:24Z,I still don't understand why British TV can only do 13 episodes per season when North American shows have between 22-24 episodes a season.  It just seems like you're getting into a British series and the season's over.  Can anyone explain that to me?
,ze-,2007-07-01T15:48Z,"i don't know why, but its not just british shows... there are north american ones doing it as well."
,Time-Machine,2007-07-02T03:53Z,"Is anyone else having trouble connecting to the tracker? I was going along fin but then within the past few hours, no matter what I try, I can't connect. I keep getting the dreaded ""urlopen"" error. Is this happening for everyone?"
,raindog469,2007-07-02T16:41Z,"Well, the tracker seems to be back up, but 0 seeds, 0 completions, no one seems to have more than 48%.... I think someone's taking the piss."
,Lamiakusinagi,2007-07-03T09:36Z,PLEASE SEED
,PaulW21781,2007-07-03T15:35Z,"I have 61.7% of this so far, and availability in Azureus is 0.617 so I guess I have most...

There was a seed yesterday with completion of 1, but everytime a connection was made, they would close the connection...

If need be, I'll download the separate episodes and just update this torrent with the complete files and seed until my ration is 2.0."
,raindog469,2007-07-05T20:21Z,"I've obtained all the episodes from other sources, and am seeding all of them except episode 11 (which had a different hash and could not be added.)  I'm at 95.7%.  Someone please add a good Episode 11 so that we can have some 100% seeders."
,PaulW21781,2007-07-05T21:49Z,"There are 2 versions of Ep11 out there...  Mines stuck at 38.2% for it...

I have the following complete...

Christmas Special, 2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 12, 13"
,srangara,2007-07-07T18:33Z,"Networx:  You do realize the BBC is Public television, right?  No advertising?

You're complaining about programming that they are literally producing and giving away for free.  Hopefully, that makes you feel a little better about what you're doing here..."
,PaulW21781,2007-07-08T04:21Z,"BBC programme's aren't free though, it's paid for via the ÂŁ131 per-year TV license fee..."

I am english and don't understand why UK series' are so short either.

Doctor Who actually has a long season for a UK show - many are just 8 episodes long.

I am guessing that part of the reason is a different production culture; many UK shows are the baby of just one writer, and one writer just can't produce as much work in a given time as a team of writers (which is the more usual approach in the US). That's not really the case with Doctor Who, though - they use a team of writers. Maybe that's why we get a whopping 13 episodes. Woo hoo!

For Doctor Who I suspect that the curtailing factor is money. The show does look as if they spend some money on it (unlike the old Doctor Who shows). I do know that the BBC replied to a query as to why the show wasn't in high definition by saying that it is much more expensive to go HD, and if they did they could only afford to produce one series every eighteen months instead of one each year.

That, plus the fact that the BBC probably think that the UK public can't sustain interest in a show for a six month run. We just lose concentration so easily; our minds start to wander so quickly and we get distract... Hey, is that a sparrow outside my window?

Of course, short seasons might also be the reason why some UK shows run for (literally) decade after decade.

Always leave them wanting more..."
,yboc2000,2007-08-31T22:21Z,"we need more seeders, im new at this but i know what seeders are, im only downloading at 8kb/s and yeah i can download a lot more faster, but this is a good file it has really good quality i give it 10/10, looks like a dvd rip"
,porterism,2007-11-13T03:57Z,"I for one would prefer 13 episodes that are consistently high quality and well written than 22-24 episodes that are hit and miss.  I don't know, but I like the fact that British TV kinda leaves you wanting more..."
,KuroiYami,2007-11-28T03:20Z,"Could someone seed this please? I think thats the problem anyway...The site says there are 5 seeders, but my bit torrent is showing absolutely nothing."
,PresidentBaltar,2008-03-02T01:12Z,"I just want two episodes please

,Pelipper929,2008-04-16T16:27Z,"OMG! Thank you!

Thank you sooooooooo much!"
,varilthes,2009-07-03T20:12Z,"The reason British networks make shorter season is just the reason you stated Networx. You are just getting into a show and they cut it short as to not tire the viewers. Remember you can have to much of a good thing. Keep it short, keep the fans wanting more. Applaud the BBC for continuely putting shows on they know their fans love and want to see. Ie:Robin hood comming back for the 3rd season. "
,Deatheriin,2010-01-20T19:47Z,"FIY Networx and imprator, it has nothing to do with British series or where ever they are form, it's the length of the episodes. If you watch The Big Bang Theory for example, there are many episodes, but they are also only 20 ish minutes long, meanwhile this series is about 40-50 minutes long. Hope that enlightens you somewhat.

While I'm on it, I might as well thank the uploader for this torrent. Thanks. =)"
,kaoten,2010-04-04T14:36Z,"Deatheriin you don't know what you're talking about.

The US has industry standards. England (and most other countries) are still formulating theirs. There's also an enormous difference in scale between the US and everywhere else.

If you want an in-depth explanation, Google it. It's not like it's some well-hidden secret or anything."
,silentbob515,2010-06-10T17:35Z,"Just wondering what is behind slowness of this torrent,180 seeds/189leechers and average speed is 18kb/s.Even slower then season 2.Also again there is shitload of ppls with 100% and none of them seed.Same story like season 2,download first 2 episodes in same time seed out 5gb and huraaa to rapid for rest."
,silentbob515,2010-06-10T18:22Z,Anyway i believe this was great torrent in better times.Thx
