,D3LinQuENT,2008-11-17T16:46Z,"Width 448
Height 192

I was not planing to watch this on my mobile! The quality sucks poor video and audio.

Quality freaks: Like me. Dont get this. Save your time and  bandwidth"
,michaelrwatson,2009-02-08T00:36Z,"Appears to have subs for the non-English parts (it does take place in Mexico!). 

To all you wannabe rippers out there: 512 is about the minimum resolution for good Q, e.g. 512x224.... and it also happens to be exactly half of standard screen resolution. This is 448 which is a bit low. You do NOT save anything at a given bitrate by lowering resolution.
"
,michaelrwatson,2009-02-08T01:48Z,"The subtitles move around a lot on the bottom of the screen. Might just be how they did them on the DVD.  Altogether a decent rip--sharp, good audio."
,Specter,2009-05-03T15:24Z,Love it.:>
,Jimer64,2009-07-05T00:47Z,"Thank you, I appreciate the gesture.
