,Persian-Tribe,2007-09-25T21:42Z,this game is bullshit i just downloaded it and i was extracting it and i picked up a virus obfustat.pwp GG the uploader is a NOOB dont download
,banbanki,2007-09-26T03:27Z,"ok finally installed the game. But when i try to launch the game, it asked me for the CD...whats that about???"
,banbanki,2007-09-26T03:28Z,how to launch this game...it keeps asking me for the CD but all the files needed are already installed on the pc.
,Tolle44,2007-09-26T11:56Z,"HOW TO INSTALL THE GAME:

Different from other BIN files, this is one of the kind where you can't just use Daemon Tool.. You'll have to use a BiN extractor and place the files in a folder.       Then after this run the exe. file. After the installation is complete, you'll have to run the NoCD crack. This file should also be an exe. though I'm not sure since I'm not actually done with the download yet. This is just how it works with more than one Bin's.

Flaming not needed nor wanted. This is help, not a guide."
,Tolle44,2007-09-26T12:01Z,"ADDITION:

If your virus scanner proclaims theirs a virus in the directory, it could very likely be the crack. Rome Total War crack for version 1.0 is an old school crack with editing in the script, as well as with viruses, therefore it reacts on the ""Obfustat"" virus."
,banbanki,2007-09-27T01:26Z,"Tolle44.  Thank you for the info but the problem is that the errors are beyond our control. We have no way of fixing the error since they come directly from the files themselves. 

Is anyone able to install and play this game successfully? Please help!!"
,banbanki,2007-09-27T03:52Z,"Finally its working fine :-). Guys this game does work but the steps are a little tricky. 

INSTRUCTION

1. Burn all the files to 3 separate CDs using iso tools. Make sure no files go missing during the burning process. If files go missing you must burn the files again. 

2. Install the game using the CDs. don't just install it using the extract files in your pc memory, that won't work. 

3. launch the game using the Crack. The crack looks the same as your desktop icon for the game. You can not lauch the game using the desktop icon, that won't work. 

Have fun. "
,Waztamann,2007-09-28T07:37Z,I've got 1 damn question.. why is the damn crack writing protected... and copy the damn thing..!! how stupid can you be to do that..?
,Bobamelius,2007-09-29T18:56Z,"Guys, when it says such and such file is missing or whatever that means it's time to load the next CD. You can do this fine in DaemonTools or whatever virtual drive program you use, it just doesn't give a CD-switching prompt for some reason. So switch the CD and hit Retry, it should continue.

And it if tells you at the beginning that you need to insert disc one, just wait a minute and the installation screen will come up anyway."

,Argus117,2007-10-15T17:53Z,Wich Broadband has everybody? I like download in 100:S
,RawMeat3000,2007-10-15T20:03Z,"Awesome torrent, works perfectly. Anyone whose still having problems, use MagicISO to extract the contents of all three .bin files to a folder. I'm not sure if you need the .cue files but I included them in the same place to be safe. Then run the setup.exe and go kill barbarians!

Which version is this (v1.1, v1.2, etc.)? 
"
,RawMeat3000,2007-10-15T20:06Z,"Oh, right and before you run the game, run the crack located wherever you installed the game. In a folder named ""Crack"" oddly enough (that sarcasm is directed at you Mcpwnster.)"
,RawMeat3000,2007-10-15T20:19Z,"You do NOT need to burn three CD's if you don't want to, it is compatible with Vista (I have it), and anyone with a problem installing Rome is doing something wrong. 
"
,avastyescurvydogs,2007-10-23T01:54Z,"@RawMeat3000

I extract all three .bin files to a folder. Could you be more specific? Do I combine every single file in one place, or combine the second and third ones into the first, or something different? I don't want to use CDs, and I tried this same thing before with a different website, but when I ""extracted all three .bin files to a folder"", and clicked on Crack, it said to insert the RTW CD, which, obviously, is a problem."
,avastyescurvydogs,2007-10-23T01:55Z,I have Vista by the way.
,avastyescurvydogs,2007-10-23T02:41Z,"Oh I downloaded it, and now during install it says it couldn't find sky.cab, even though I have it in B folder. Plus, I once got past the install before, but it was the same problem: insert fucking CD."
,avastyescurvydogs,2007-10-23T03:28Z,"Now, I am operating under the assumption that all the correct files needed to play RTW are in this download, and I am not missing anything. Therefore I just need to find the right configuration of files (which file goes where, that sort of thing) in order to play the game. WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE FUCKING TELL ME THEIR CONFIGURATION SO I CAN PLAY THE GODDAMN GAME!"
,avastyescurvydogs,2007-10-23T05:13Z,Hmmm... do you think downloading the no cd crack would work? I'll try it.
,avastyescurvydogs,2007-10-23T06:45Z,Nope didn't work. Am I talking to myself here?
,jaycsmff,2007-10-28T15:09Z,"Thanx for the upload works perfectly
Here is the way to install with out any error its a bit complicated for amatears but should work for most people

After download you will have 3 .bin files and 3 .cue files. 
1.first you will have to mount the first 
.cue file with daemon tools this will start the installation process 

2.after awhile it should ask you to insert the second cd now you will have to unmount the first .cue file and mount the second .cue file and press ok or retry 

3.after a while it will ask you to do the same insert cd three so unmount the second .cue file and mount the third .cue file and press ok or retry 

4.then again it will ask you to insert cd one so unmount the third .cue file and mount the first .cue file again and press ok or retry

5. after the installation dont bother with any crack or patches for the game download the (ROME_TW_CD1.MDS CD-Image) from http://www.gamecopyworld.com in gamecopyworld search for rome total war then click on it after you should find the(ROME_TW_CD1.MDS CD-Image) under  
(Rome: Total War [ENGLISH/GERMAN] No-CD/Fixed Image) download it and extract the archive and mount the .mds file with daemon tools and play the game 
Note: do not convert the bin or cue files to any other format and when installing each time it asks you to insert a new cd it may be hard to mount the .cue files as the installation window does not go away you can press ctrl+alt+delete to get the task manager up then you should be able to mount the .cue files each time it asks for a new cd "
,bhamm_1,2007-10-30T14:43Z,"I am having some serious troubles with this program.   I have tried installing using daemon to mount the .cue files and it installs fine. I replace the crack RomeTW and when I run the program my monitor goes black and the power light begins to flicker.  I have tried every patch with itsa corresponding crack.....same thing. I have also extracted all the files from the 3 .bin files and installed repeating all steps to no avail.  What is causing this black screen?
Please help"
,zilken1398,2007-10-31T12:01Z,"Helo here come some easier instruction from jaycsmmf: follow the instruction 1-4, then go into
http://www.gamecopyworld.com and search for rome total war as he told, then click on the first link of rome: total war (rome total war barbarin invasion) or somthing. Then  you will se under 
Rome: Total War [ENGLISH/GERMAN] No-CD/Fixed Image  THIS FILES:
ROME_TW_CD1.MDS CD-Image (there is v.1.0 or v.1.1) to see your version of rome total war just hold your mouse in the icon of rome total war! plz comment if you understand! . Well download the version  you got and extract it at your rome: total war folder (Winrar needed) when you extract it press: ""yes to all"" or ""Yes""
to start the game. (DAEMON tools needed) go into daemon tools and open the ""rld-rtwa.cue"" 
THEN PLAY !!!"
,bhamm_1,2007-10-31T12:30Z,"for some reason i am still getting the black screen.....regardless of how i go about this
Hmmmmmm perhaps my problem is not in the game itself.

It isn't going to matter i am running daemon v4.1 is it?"
,zilken1398,2007-10-31T14:32Z,"i think so... but download the latest version of Daeomon tools. google it, and perheps there are some problems with your graphic card. BUT THE IMPORTANT. when you open rome: total war CD1 and press ""play rom: total war"" the game will not start. You have to go to your Rome -  total war folder  and open the game therefrom. and it is important that you download the rome_TW_cdc1 or what the shit is for your correct version of rome. Thank you!"
,bhamm_1,2007-11-01T04:12Z,"Yeah, it was a graphics card driver issue.  For some reason ATI CCC was causing an issue.  For anyone else having this problem I found www.omegadrivers.com seems to have just about everything you may need for driver issues. REal Easy!

It says: ""Please insert the correct CD-ROM, select OK and restart application""

How do I fix this? >."

thank you in advance... ;)"
,JumperJack,2007-11-04T15:19Z,"oh, sorry for the double post, but i found a solution to solve the wrong CD-ROM error.

No need to download any shit or update anything... 


 jaycsmff at 2007-10-28 15:09 CET:
Thanx for the upload works perfectly
Here is the way to install with out any error its a bit complicated for amatears but should work for most people

After download you will have 3 .bin files and 3 .cue files.
1.first you will have to mount the first
.cue file with daemon tools this will start the installation process

2.after awhile it should ask you to insert the second cd now you will have to unmount the first .cue file and mount the second .cue file and press ok or retry

3.after a while it will ask you to do the same insert cd three so unmount the second .cue file and mount the third .cue file and press ok or retry

4.then again it will ask you to insert cd one so unmount the third .cue file and mount the first .cue file again and press ok or retry

5. after the installation dont bother with any crack or patches for the game download the (ROME_TW_CD1.MDS CD-Image) from http://www.gamecopyworld.com in gamecopyworld search for rome total war then click on it after you should find the(ROME_TW_CD1.MDS CD-Image) under
(Rome: Total War [ENGLISH/GERMAN] No-CD/Fixed Image) download it and extract the archive and mount the .mds file with daemon tools and play the game
Note: do not convert the bin or cue files to any other format and when installing each time it asks you to insert a new cd it may be hard to mount the .cue files as the installation window does not go away you can press ctrl+alt+delete to get the task manager up then you should be able to mount the .cue files each time it asks for a new cd


*heil!!*"
,mikeyboy94,2007-12-04T17:39Z,"I don't understand this part:

to mount an image right click on the thunder icon in your system tray>virtual CD/CDROM>F:> mount image

,MHN,2008-01-27T04:34Z,"i got problems.... please someone help me, when i open the file, it just shows me some files which i can't open, also what crack do i need"
,TheAmazingRando,2008-02-01T20:46Z,"Ok, wow.
I have it running on Vista (albeit a little slowly; Medieval 2 runs better on Vista), and it wasn't difficult at all.

Here's exactly what I did:
1. Mount the CUE file for the first disk using Daemon Tools.  If you can't tell which is disc one, they're sorted alphabetically; disc one ends with an ""a"", etc...
2. When the disc menu opens, select ""Install"".
3. When prompted for disc 2, unmount disc 1 and mount disc 2 in its place.  Repeat when it asks for disc 3 and then disc 1 again.
NOTE: At first I tried mounting all 3 discs at once so I wouldn't have to touch Daemon again, but I got missing file errors during installation.  If you had this problem, try doing the discs one at a time.
4. Apply the crack.  There is one in there; it's in disc one in a folder called ""Crack"" (use PowerIso or MagicIso to get to it if you want), but it didn't immediately work for me and I wasn't interesting in farting around with it.
Instead, you can go here:
http://m0001.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_rome_total_war.shtml#Rome:%20Total%20War%20[ENGLISH/GERMAN]%20No-CD/Fixed%20Image
- and download the file called ""Rome Total War [ENGLISH/GERMAN] blah blah blah...""
5. Use Winrar to unpack the file you just downloaded, unmount anything still on Daemon, and mount the new MDS file.
6. The desktop shortcut to R:TW should now work quite dandily.

You could probably also extract the BINs to disc and install directly, but I didn't do it that way and I'm not going to bother trying.

Also, if you don't understand any of the terms I used, DON'T FUCKING POST TO ASK ABOUT IT.  Quit being an idiot and learn how to use Google/Wikipedia."

,punkstereo,2008-04-05T21:26Z,"woot, i got this game working just fine.  here's what i did.

1) using alcohol 120% i mounted the first .cue image onto a virtual drive and started the installation

2 when it asks for the 2nd disc, unmount the first .cue image and mount the second .cue image.  click ok to continue.

3) when it asks for the third disc, unmount the second .cue image and mount the third .cue image.  press ok to continue.

4) when it asks for the first cd again, unmount the third .cue image and mount the first one again.  click ok to continue.

5) once installation has completed, google for the patches 1.3 and 1.5 (you'll need 1.3 first before you can install the 1.5 patch) and install the patches in the right order

6) google rome total war crack and it should be the first link.  make sure you download the 1.5 no-cd crack.

7) replace the game icon in your games folder with the one in the crack (make a shortcut to desktop if you want) and double click and it should work.

that's what i did anyway.  would have been nice if the uploader of this torrent posted instructions on how to download but i guess it was already nice enough that he/she uploaded the files for us in the first place anyway."

Once you copy over the crack, just use that to launch the game. For example, go into your Activision folder and click on Rome Total War and then on the crack exe that you copied over.

-""You do NOT need to burn three CD's if you don't want to, it is compatible with Vista.
-Use MagicISO or PowerISO to extract the contents of all 3 *.bin files to a folder. 
(Just bypass any extraction of duplicate file names, no matter what the size.)
-Then run the ""setup.exe"" and go kill barbarians!
-Before you run the game, copy the file ""RomeTW.exe"" from the Crack folder to 
the location where you installed the game. Just run ""RomeTW.exe"".
-NO SERIAL needed for when I run it off-line.

P.S.-If you have a problem with the game screen appearing way-too-large, see below:
-It's a nVidia problem. 
-I rolled back the driver to version ""81.95"" and 
now the game works perfectly. 
-When you run the install of v81.95, you might need to reboot twice;
-once for removal of your current version, -once for the 81.95 install.
Look for the small nVidia install window on the 2nd reboot.
-It's the 91.+ version that screws up Rome Total War.

there is no way in fucking hell that this is real. I bought the game legit and it comes on 2 DVDs  which means that actual size of the game would be 2-4 the size of the file that you are downloading in this torrent.

The file you are downloading is most likely a stripped down ISO with many of its dependencies missing so the game will not install properly.

All you need to do (vista users) is mount the first bin file to start installing.
Then just mount the second and third when it prompts you,
and when its all done, copy the crack file into your RTW program file (there will be something there that looks exactly like it)

,jerry219,2008-06-25T19:14Z,"The game works perfectly. Cue-bin files are simply disc images, so you have 3 discs ending a, b, c instead of 1, 2, 3. Simplest way to install:
1. If you have Alcohol 120%- drag all 3 .cue files into Alcohol and mount rld-rtwa into your virtual drive. If don't have Alcohol mount this file with Daemon Tools.
2. Run Autorun as it comes up on your screen.
3. When Install program asks for Disc 2, mount rld-rtwb in Alcohol. Use ALT-TAB to switch between Alcohol and Install program. Don't run Autorun when it pops up, just press OK in Install. Do the same with Disc 3 (rld-rtwc), and then again with Disc 1 (rld-rtwa). 
4. Instal DirectX if you need it, don't instal Arcade, this version doesn't allow playing online.
5. Finish instalation process - don't try to play the game, just quit.
6. Now open your virtual drive, and Crack folder on it, copy RomeTW file and paste it to C:\Program Files\Activision\Rome - Total War folder (overwrite when you are asked).
7. Use your Rome - Total War icon on your desktop and enjoy.
If this game install and works perfectly on my Vista, it has to work on XP as well."

,pfk-,2008-08-02T08:49Z,"It's a great torrent download. Worked perfectly for me. I use Vista for those wondering if it works with vista.

I had trouble at first also but I solved my problems by looking through the comments. 

It really helps if you have daemon tools. You can download it here:
http://www.filehippo.com/download_daemon_tools/

I suggest reading page 3 of the comments. I had to download an extra patch for the game to make it work. 

Hint for the first time daemon tool users (like me :P):
To mount up the CUE file, go to the shortcut icon in the taskbar and right click it > Virtual CD/DVD-ROM > Device [G:] Empty > Mount image > search for the CUE files for Rome Total war.
During the installation process, you'll encounter a message saying ""please insert cd2"", ""please insert cd3"" and then ""please insert cd1"" again. In order to do that, get back to the desktop (I just press the Windows Start menu shortcut button on the keyboard for that), and right click the daemon tools shortcut button on the taskbar again > Device [G:]... > Unmount Image. Then mount up the necessary CUE file just like you did with the first CUE file.

Hope this helps."

Error 1309: Error reading from file: K:\Setup\Data\Data\editor\brush_01.tga  Retry?  Ignore?

(where K: is my virtual CD drive)

'Retrying' doesn't help.  'Ignoring' just immediately finds an error with the next tga file and so on.  I had to abort installation.  Oh well, thanks anyway."
,LezDawson,2008-08-17T12:06Z,"Sorry guys, my bad, ignore my comment above.  I ran a registry fix, and then it installed fine.

HOWEVER!

It still won't run.  There is a misleading comment earlier about running the crack exe in a folder called 'crack' that appears where the program is installed.  But as some people have pointed out - there is no crack folder there.

HOWEVER (again)!

If you mount CD1 again, and just go to My Computer and 'Explore' the CD, you will see the Crack folder there, and inside is RomeTW.exe, which is obviously the crack.

HOWEVER (yet again)!

I double-clicked this, and just got an error message:

This application has failed to start because mss32.dll was not found.  Re-installing the application may fix this problem.

Sigh.  I'll try re-installing.  I'm not going to start downloading 'NoCD' cracks or anything just yet - chris1960 surely would have said so in his description if this was necessary.  I'll try re-installing now."
,LezDawson,2008-08-17T14:03Z,"Bah.  It's no good.  I'm just getting the original error (see last-but-one comment), and it won't install at all.
Must be my system. I give up."
,LezDawson,2008-08-17T14:50Z,"Yeay!  I got it to work.  OK, I found out the hard way, but here goes:

Mount disc 1 (bin or cue, no matter which).  When prompted to insert disc 2, make sure you UNmount disc 1 before continuing to mount disc 2!  This is where I had gone wrong before.

Do the same at the next prompt: unmount disc 2, then mount disc 3.

And again when prompted, unmount disc 3, and mount disc 1 again, to complete the installation, including directX9 if required.

Finally, when the screen comes up with the option to 'Play the Game' (amongst other options) select 'QUIT'.

Go to 'My Computer'
Explore your Rome - Total war CD
Click into the Crack Folder
Right-click/copy the RomeTW.exe file
Paste it in place of the other RomeTW.exe file that was created where the program was installed.
You now have a fully working crack.

I'm still downloading it, but if it's like most other torrents, this is how:

1. Locate the crack folder on the mounted ISO.
(Or CD... It's usually named Crack)
2. Inside there you'll find an EXE file; copy it.
3. Go to the games directory.
4. Paste the Crack there, it will ask you something; choose copy and replace.

I cannot save the game when I'm in Prologue...

Any help would be appreciated.

Please and Thank you."
,Hells_Mishap,2008-11-21T03:24Z,"HOW TO INSTALL:

After the download you will have 3 .bin files and 3 .cue files.

1) First you will have to mount the first
.cue file with Daemon Tools. ( They are in order) This will start the installation process.

2) After awhile, it should ask you to insert the second CD now. You will have to UNMOUNT the first .cue file and mount the second .cue file then click ""OK"" or ""Retry"". ( If you cannot see the ""Start"" menu, press the Window - it looks like a flag -  button on the keyboard. This will allow you to access Daemon Tools as the window screen will be fully black while installing)

3) After awhile, it will ask you to insert the third CD now. You will have to UNMOUNT the second .cue file and mount the third .cue file then click  ""OK"" or ""Retry"".

4) Then again, it will ask you to insert the first CD. Now, UNMOUNT the third .cue file and mount the first .cue file again then click ""OK"" or ""Retry"". ( Also, when asked, install DirectX9)

5) When the screen comes up with the option to 'Play the Game' (amongst other options) select 'QUIT'.

6) Now, UNMOUNT everything then mount the first .cue file using Daemon Tools again. (When the ""Rome Total War"" screen comes up, click ""QUIT"".

7) Click ""Start"" and go to ""My Computer"". Then, right click the ""Rome_TW_CD1"" and click ""Explore"". Open the ""Crack"" folder then right click on ""RomeTW"" and click ""Copy"". Now, go to C:\Program Files\Activision and paste. When prompted, click ""Yes"" or ""Yes to All"".

You now have a fully working crack.

No need to download anything else. 

From now on, the Rome Total War desktop icon should now work properly."

Had no trouble installing, just mount the files one at a time with daemon tools and install as normal. Download the patches from fileshack or wherever then the latest version crack from gamecopyworld.

Anyone having problems with the game crashing all the time (like I did) should read this:

http://erado.totalwar.org/survival/index.htm

I followed that guide carefully and now it runs fine where before it was resetting my PC, crashing to windows or BSOD every 5 minutes."

___________________

I'll be using PowerISO but your program's settings may be similar.

1. Go to Options --> Configuration.

2. Under ""File Associations,"" select .bin.

3. Your rld-rtwa.bin file in your downloaded folder should now have the PowerISO icon on it. 
Double click the file. PowerISO should open up.

4. The first folder listed is ""Crack"". Open it.

5. Drag RomeTW.exe to your Rome - Total War folder. Ie, C:/Program Files/Activision/Rome - Total War.

Replace the other file.

They seposed to be in cd-1 setup/data/data/editor but they are in cd-3 setup/data/data/editor and when installation cannot find it in cd-1 the setup will not complete.

,HugeMullet,2009-04-12T14:46Z,"Thanks chris1960, excellent torrent!

For anyone who might be a newbe (like myself), these are the steps that I took.

1) If you don't have it already download Daemon tools. This bit of software will allow your computer to create virtual drives, saving you the hassle of burning multiple CD's.

2) Go to the 'add images...' in the file menu of Daemon tools and select the 'rld-rtwa' file. 

3) Once you have done this the file will appear on the right hand side of the program.  Double click this and it will mount the image (as if the CD had been placed into the drive of a computer). Select run Autorun.exe and this will then take you though the installation procedure.

4) After a while it should ask you to insert CD 2, so you will have to load the image of CD 2 to the same virtual drive. To do this press the windows button on your keyboard to take you back to Daemon tools. Then right click over the image file and select remove. Then mount the 'rld-rtwb' file. You have now essentially loaded to 2nd CD so you can go back to the instillation program and notify it of this fact.

5) Take the same steps as shown above when you are asked  insert CD 3 ('rld-rtwc)' and CD 1 (again). 

6) Once the program is installed you need to replace the RomeTM file with the crack version. You will find the crack version within 'rld-rtwa', so you will have to explore this virtual CD. To do this go back to Daemon tools and if 'rld-rtwa' isn't already mounted, mount it. After double clicking the image this time select 'Open Folders To View Files', then open up the crack file and copy and paste the RomeTM to  C:/Program Files/Activision/Rome - Total War (or the equivalent path) to replace the original.

7) All done, it should work perfectly. "
,HugeMullet,2009-04-12T21:12Z,"One more point, you will need to load the game up from the cracked RomeTM file. If you try to load the game up from the start menu you computer will not be able to trace the file (since the file was essentially deleted the file in step 6). So its probably best to either create a shortcut of the cracked RomeTM file for you desktop or the start menu."
,Nikias44,2009-04-13T14:14Z,"hi im new at this, im downloading this torrent and iv got daemon tools lite,can anyone tell me what to do after the dowload finishes????

and what is seeding??    thanks!!!"
,LittleNooblet,2009-04-17T08:08Z,"@Nikias44
Firstly, seeding is uploading the file/files that you have(google). Personally I dont use deamon tools, Ill just burn the files onto a dvd using nero(burn as iso image) 
hope that helps if not just google the rest happy pirating m8 :) "

7) All done, it should work perfectly. 

^^ I made it all the way up to this step, and got lost. Daemon Tools wont let me double click open the rld.rtwa image, i dont understand what im supposed to do to open the virtual disk, i have daemon tools lite (4.30.1). Could it be a different version of daemon tools im supposed to be using to find the crack in the rtwa image? Help me, im completely lost at this step."
,HugeMullet,2009-04-21T15:49Z,"@peteypablo4747 ,

Once a image is mounted you essentially have a virtual drive with a CD loaded. So just...

1) right click on the start button and go to explore.

2) If you look at your drives you should see another drive the letter varies from computer to computer (depending on how many physical drives you already have); mine appears as 'drive (E:) Rome_T_W_CD1' (Note: Make sure that you have mounted 'rld-rtwa').

3) Then just click on this drive and you will see the crack folder.

Good luck "
,peteypablo4747,2009-04-25T23:10Z,"na dude, its because i dont have Daemon tools Pro on my computer.

,HaNor,2009-06-26T18:05Z,"Very Good Torrent, Excellent game

Few notes of interest

if your using daemon tools to mount disc images, note that, daemon tools does not recognize .bin disc images, but does in fact support them

when mounting your images, make sure to select ""all files"" instead of ""all supported images"" otherwise you will not find the appropiate image"
,HaNor,2009-06-26T18:12Z,"@ack 4

in order to install this game, you need the ability to mount disc images

http://www.disc-tools.com/download/daemon
download that

install it

then install rome total war, (mount rtwa.bin then auto run, then mount rtwb.bin, when prompted for second disc, continue, then rtwc.bin, continue, then rtwa.bin again, when finished, go to computer, the drive rtwa.bin is in, copy the file from the folder labeled crack, and paste in c:/activison/rometotalwar"

,critchy,2009-07-10T02:10Z,"Thanks mate Works great.
After download you will have 3 .bin files and 3 .cue files.
1.first you will have to mount the first
.cue file with daemon tools this will start the installation process

2.after awhile it should ask you to insert the second cd now you will have to unmount the first .cue file and mount the second .cue file and press ok or retry

3.after a while it will ask you to do the same insert cd three so unmount the second .cue file and mount the third .cue file and press ok or retry

4.then again it will ask you to insert cd one so unmount the third .cue file and mount the first .cue file again and press ok or retry. when done quit game.

5.search on my computer for virtual disc with Rome Total War on and explore it. go to crack folder and copy rometw.exe file and overwrite the romwtw.exe file in game folder.

hope this works for you like it did for me. "

,jlw08,2009-12-16T06:01Z,"ATTENTION::: Here is important installation information for this torrent.... I found some of the most informative comments here and compiled them into this:

 Tolle44 at 2007-09-26 11:56 CET:
HOW TO INSTALL THE GAME:

Different from other BIN files, this is one of the kind where you can't just use Daemon Tool.. You'll have to use a BiN extractor and place the files in a folder. Then after this run the exe. file. After the installation is complete, you'll have to run the NoCD crack. This file should also be an exe. though I'm not sure since I'm not actually done with the download yet. This is just how it works with more than one Bin's.

Flaming not needed nor wanted. This is help, not a guide.

ADDITION:

If your virus scanner proclaims theirs a virus in the directory, it could very likely be the crack. Rome Total War crack for version 1.0 is an old school crack with editing in the script, as well as with viruses, therefore it reacts on the ""Obfustat"" virus. 

 banbanki at 2007-09-27 03:52 CET:
Finally its working fine :-). Guys this game does work but the steps are a little tricky.

INSTRUCTION

1. Burn all the files to 3 separate CDs using iso tools. Make sure no files go missing during the burning process. If files go missing you must burn the files again. (EDIT: ALSO U CAN MOUNT THEM ONTO SEPERATE VIRTUAL DRIVES WITH DAEMON TOOLS!!)

2. Install the game using the CDs. don't just install it using the extract files in your pc memory, that won't work.

3. launch the game using the Crack. The crack looks the same as your desktop icon for the game. You can not lauch the game using the desktop icon, that won't work.

Have fun. 

 Bobamelius at 2007-09-29 18:56 CET:
Guys, when it says such and such file is missing or whatever that means it's time to load the next CD. You can do this fine in DaemonTools or whatever virtual drive program you use, it just doesn't give a CD-switching prompt for some reason. So switch the CD and hit Retry, it should continue.

And it if tells you at the beginning that you need to insert disc one, just wait a minute and the installation screen will come up anyway.

jaycsmff at 2007-10-28 15:09 CET:
Thanx for the upload works perfectly
Here is the way to install with out any error its a bit complicated for amatears but should work for most people

After download you will have 3 .bin files and 3 .cue files.
1.first you will have to mount the first
.cue file with daemon tools this will start the installation process

2.after awhile it should ask you to insert the second cd now you will have to unmount the first .cue file and mount the second .cue file and press ok or retry

3.after a while it will ask you to do the same insert cd three so unmount the second .cue file and mount the third .cue file and press ok or retry

4.then again it will ask you to insert cd one so unmount the third .cue file and mount the first .cue file again and press ok or retry

5. after the installation dont bother with any crack or patches for the game download the (ROME_TW_CD1.MDS CD-Image) from http://www.gamecopyworld.com in gamecopyworld search for rome total war then click on it after you should find the(ROME_TW_CD1.MDS CD-Image) under
(Rome: Total War [ENGLISH/GERMAN] No-CD/Fixed Image) download it and extract the archive and mount the .mds file with daemon tools and play the game
Note: do not convert the bin or cue files to any other format and when installing each time it asks you to insert a new cd it may be hard to mount the .cue files as the installation window does not go away you can press ctrl+alt+delete to get the task manager up then you should be able to mount the .cue files each time it asks for a new cd"
,Joshscho,2009-12-18T03:25Z,I seem to be having real trouble with this downloaded OK but now i have the files on there it will not open i am using the cracked copy supplied every time i try to load it keeps saying encountered pruble any ideas? PLZ HELP
,tribalnem,2009-12-20T04:57Z,"ok so this is how to install rome

2. USE POWERISO (poweriso.com) FOR SURE or else this wont work
3. go to folder u downloaded rtw in
4. open the first folder and press Launch.exe.
5. press install and it will ask for cd 2
6. have daemon tools on cpu
7. mount disc 2 or the 3rd folder u see in the rtw folder
8. ask for cd 3 repeat steps before it will ask for cd 1 again so mount the first file
9. once u have shortcut copy crack from first file into program files/activision/rometotalwar"
,tribalnem,2009-12-22T21:16Z,srry for step 4 u should mount the 1st file(if ur not sure check inside it should say Launch.exe.) and press install

Dont remember if the tw:rome ask for net access back on vista. -_-

Gary, download 'daemon tools

use that program to create a virtual drive (basicly tricks your computer in making another disk drive) when you have done this 'mount' the download file rld-rtwa to the drive (basicly means upload the file u have downloaded to the new disk drive) your computer will think you have a disk of this game when you dont. 
if you get this far just follow markbtje's instructions in the previous comment.

,inoksvere,2010-04-22T11:03Z,"So I installed the game and everything, including extracting the mss32.dll file into my system32 directory.

I'm going to uninstall the game and reinstall it. Does anyone know how to successfully download patches? Any hints would help, thanks."
,ghostlyshadow,2010-06-04T22:19Z,"ok so i had problems but i finally was able to get this game to work so for those who are still having problems i will explain again and hopefully it helps.

I mounted the BIN files using Daemon Tools.

1. Mount disc 1 and use the auto run to start the install. Part way through the install it has an error for a missing file. For some reason it doesnt just tell you that you need disc 2 sooo..

2. Unmount disc 1 and mount disc 2 then click retry on the missing file screen. For me it went fine all the way to a point where it asked for disc 3 sooo.

3. Unmount disc 2 and mount disc 3 and click the continue button. For me the install continued to the very end where one last time it asked for disc 1 soooo.

4. Unmount disc 3 and remount disc 1 in its place and click continue. After this point the install finishes.

5. The crack is located on disc 1 so open my computer, right click disc 1 and open and there will be a folder labeled crack. Open the crack folder and there will be a RTW icon there.

6. Copy and paste this crack where your games files are located. Make sure to copy and replace the old files. Enjoy and play the game :) hope this helps.

Also for me I was not able to located the game files the normal way i do through my c drive and program files so what i did was. Click start/ all programs went all the way down to rome total war folder, right clicked the application and clicked open file location and that is where you paste your crack file."

,donttryifyoucantdoit,2010-11-22T23:56Z,"jeez reading through these comments amazes me.  why do you idiots say this torrent is bad :S by the looks of it its good, iam in the process of downloading right now and heres a few things that will hopefully sink in your head, because its not the downloads fault, its your fault for doing something you dont have half a damn clue on how to do!

1.  Bin files - THEY CAN STILL BE USED WITH DAIMON TOOLS/ ""Power Iso""

2.  use daimon tools light, much easier then power iso and the more pro versions of daimon tools and will hopefully make you a bit less confused.

3.  ALWAYS MOUNT THE DAMN FILES WITH THE SAME DAMN VIRTUAL DRIVE! JEEZ USE YOUR HEAD!

4.  dont get mad if you cant play it -.- 85% of the time its cause either there is no crack, or the crack that came with the torrent is garbage.

anything i forgot? o.o,  make sure you check my computer after mounting,  dont expect the game to start by itself, you still have to setup/install.  install it then switch the .exe (EXECUTABLE) file with the crack. the .exe if the file with a picture on it you click to start the game up,  no its not the short cut so dont be a idiot and switch the crack with the shortcut or you will be more lost then ever :) byebye"
,marky2012,2010-11-28T01:56Z,"WoW... 120kb/s!!!!
pretty fast.
i hope it works. =]"
,Merlihc68,2010-12-01T10:22Z,"Right, For lots of you that are having problems this is what you have to do

1. download the torrent

2. Extract ALL files into ONE folder (DO NOT sub folder)

3. Install game (if you did above steps corectly then you shouldn't get the "".source"" problem.

4. Go to the crack folder in the folder you extracted all the .BIN files and place the .exe into the Rome total war folder where you just installed the game

5. click on the .exe in the folder and run the game (plus you may want to make a shortcut because the file on your desktop will now no longer work)

6. have fun"
,dartweider22,2010-12-02T00:17Z,it wont work cuse u need to put the crack!!!!!!1........ copy the crack file and replace it with the original one on ur game directory
,Armando09,2010-12-16T03:11Z,"I had problems figuring this one out and I had the whole ""Please insert correct CD rom"" bs myself. Just figured it out and thought I'd lend a hand.

First I used Utorrent to download the file: Rome Total War. The folder had 6 files in it. 3 where BIN type and 3 where CUE type. I guess the 3 BIN types are the ""CD-1"" ""CD-2"" and ""CD-3"" files.

Second I used MagicISO to install the game. I opened Magic ISO and selected the ""Tools"" tab and selected the ""Virtual CD/DVD ROM"" button, then ""F: C:\ Documents and...War\rld-rtwc.bin"" button, then the ""MOUNT..."" button. Then a new window opens showing the ""Rome Total War"" folder that I already downloaded from Pirate Bay containing the 3 CUE and 3 BIN files. I clicked the first BIN file which I'm assuming was ""CD-1"" and then it started extracting files and installing. Whenever the installation paused and it asked for a new CD I just used MagicISO again and clicked the second and third Bin files in the ""Rome Total War"" folder. Then to finish installation it asked for CD-1 again and I just clicked the first BIN file and it finished installation. It kept asking if I wanted to install separate programs like DirectX and Media 9 but I already had that stuff so I clicked ""No Thanks"".
Then my installation was completed and it made it's own Activision folder in my program files.

Then in ""C:\Program Files\Activision\Rome - Total War 
Then I was all jazzed to play but when I clicked the RomeTW.exe file it said "" Please Insert Correct CD ROM drive"" or some crap like that.  So I thought to myself maybe I should find me the crack so I went to http://dl.gamecopyworld.com/?d=2004&f=rld-rtw!rar  and found the link for Rome Total War Version 1 (cause that what this one is) and downloaded the CRACK. 

It's in RAR type so I used WinRAR to extract it to my desktop. Then I deleted the old desktop shortcut and the RomeTW.exe in my program files and put the new one/crack in it's place. Now it works like a dream and I'm killing everything I see. 

Programs used: Utorrent, MagicISO, and WinRAR. 

As far a Viruses I haven't noticed anything weird so far. Good luck to all and thank you chris1960 guy."
,djrivers,2010-12-21T20:35Z,download the game works with windows 7 to perfection and to install daemon tools you need to use a very effective program easy and fast thanks for the game. but I have a small problem before asking you to play the disc number 1 after installing all three. and then asks for cracks cost me a little work to find them and a copy is damaged.

,Jaskbi,2011-05-03T15:47Z,"Work Perfectly Fine, The problem peopel may have is making more than 1 virtual drive for each Cue file, use Demon Tools light, Make a virtual drive, add file to it, open the Total Rome folder through Light, Click on the 1st Cue file as there in order, Mount then go to my Computer run it, once it does it will ask for disk 2 go back to Demon Tool from the same Virtual Drive add the second Cue and press ok to the game which is asking for Disk 2 and do the same for the Cue file.

Once done go and download the 1.0 Cd crack open it with winra and copy that file to the Total Rome folder which will be in Activison in program files and run"

1. Read earlier comments.
2. Learn basic computer-usage!"
,capdude4,2011-05-22T07:47Z,"TUTORIAL! 
~All The Other Peoples Ones Suck~
1.Download Daemon Tools Lite ONLY DAEMON TOOLS WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2.Go to your folder in which youve download the files into. THere should be 3 .cue And 3 .Bins and 1 iso.
2. Once daemon tools is installed (YOu must reboot computer to work) drag the iso into the daemon tools window. then click it and click the play button (Mount It) 

3.then drag rld-rtwa.cue into the window and mount that, it should say mounting image. There now a window should pop up? and click launch.exe and there ..

When it asks you to insert disc 2 just mount 
rld-rtwb.cue.. and so on"

,mbartelsm,2011-06-08T19:54Z,"Okamizen, CUE files can be mounted or burned just like ISO files, but they need their respective BIN files in order to work, DAEMON TOOLS can mount both BIN and CUE files"
,mbartelsm,2011-06-08T20:08Z,"FILE MISSING ERROR SOLUTION:

After you download the game you will have 3 BIN files and 3 CUE files

Mount rld-rtwa.CUE with daemon tools DO NOT MOUNT THE OTHER CDs

Install the game, when it asks you for the CD 2 press alt-tab and unmount the rld-rtwa.CUE file, then mount rld-rtwb.CUE, do the same with the third CD but with rld-rtwc.CUE

After that, crack the game and enjoy!"
,andylaw1997,2011-06-09T19:02Z,"This works for me. Worked perfectly and well. For the people who it didn't work for, all you have to do is:

Stuff needed:
1. Daemon tools.
2. P2P tool to download this
3. Patience
4. A Brain

Procedure:
1. Download this
2. You'll see 6 files. 3 Bin and 3 Cue
3. Create a folder called, ""Rome Total War"" on the desktop and extract the 6 files into it.
4.Make sure no weird message's come up like, ""some files couldn't be found"" or whatever.
5. Open up Daemon Tools and add the .cue files to mount
6.Mount the first file (rld-r-twa.cue) and run the autorun. A autorun will appear and say Install. Click on that
7. Wait for it to install.
8. While it's installing, it will ask you to insert disk 2, then 3 and finally 1 again. How to do so: When it asks to insert, go back to daemon tools. Add the 2nd cue (rld-r-twb.cue) and mount it, then click on OK in the installer. Afterwards it will ask to insert disk 3, again go back to daemon tools, add the 3rd cue (rld-r-twc.cue) and mount it, then go back to the installer and click OK and run it. Later it's going to ask for Disk one to complete the installation, back to daemon tools, scroll down bottom and you'll see rld-r-twa, (Disk 1) which you already added, just click on it and click mount, go back to the installer and click OK. 
9. after it's Done, in the end, it will ask you to install some important microsoft thing which will help play the game properly, so you will have to install that.
10. After the microsoft thing, it will ask you to install directX 9.0. Just install it, its no harm anyway and it will take 1 second to do so.
11. Click finish
12. Hold on, now you'll get the error ""Please insert the correct disk"" when you try to play.
13. Mount Disk one again, (rld-r-twa.cue) and instead of clicking autorun, click on open files and folders. Inside there, you'll see a folder called, Crack. Open the folder, copy the application (RomeTW.exe) and paste it into your Game folder (Rome total war, the one you just installed.)
14. Now start the game.
15. Have fun

Note: This is the easiest guide I could make. If you still don't understand this then no one can help you. If you have questions just ask. I'll keep checking everyday.

Problems which can occur while this:
1. Sometimes when you try play the game, It will say, missing files, and the game crashes.
Solution: Re-download this file and reinstall the game
2. In the beginning when you open the setup, ""Runtime error, installer aborted""
Solution: Re-extract the game and try again
3.When trying to extract, ""corrupted files""
Solution: Re-download the game.
4.Game dosen't even start saying ""Rome total war has stopped working""
Solution: Upgrade you're graphics card.

Good luck people!"

1. Download  poweriso

2.open power iso and then mount the rld-rtwA.BIN, this will be the first installation disk then you just need to wait while it installs then it should ask for the second disk, you need to go to poweriso and mount the rld-rtwaB.Bin( note: you need to mount then click ok on the pop up) do the same for the rld-rtwaC.Bin

3. once it installs go to poweriso again and at the top click on open and go to the folder where the Bin & Cue files are and open the rld-rtwA.CUE and then it will show the contents inside and at the top should be the CRACK folder.

4. open up my computer and go to where you intalled the game and there should be the RomeTW.exe delete that and then open the Crack folder and move the RomeTW.exe in there to where the previous one was in the install folder.

5. now click on the .exe and have fun. "

1. Once you have downloaded it, mount rld-rtwa on a drive, can use either images (.bin or .cue).
2. Run the drive and it will prompt the setup.
3. Follow along the setup and when it asks you to insert disk 2; hit the flag key on the bottom left of your keyboard and find the folder with the images and mount rld-rtwb. Don't worry about disk 1.
4. Again, repeat step 3, but mount disk 3 (rld-rtwc).
5. You can't run the game without the NOCD Crack. Where is it? Go in rld_rtwa (disk 1) and find the folder Crack. Get the RomeTW file and extract it to: Computer/C:/Program Files (x86)/Activision/Rome - Total War replacing the current RomeTW. There's the mss32.dll that you seem to not find. Now run that new RomeTW and it should work!

Use the trial version of Deamon Tools to create a virtual drive then mount the first ISO file to the drive and run DISC1. When you get the first missing file message, hit the START button to leave the instalation screen and mount the second ISO file to the same virtual drive. Repeat with DISC3.

,Captin_Gray,2012-07-03T15:42Z,"As of now, the game has worked beautifully. Amazing download. I have yet yo try to load a save file, I've heard there might be some problems there."
,kronos88,2012-07-04T02:01Z,"Works fine, though I haven't attempted an update yet.

1. Mount the first .bin file (most imaging software will not recognize it as an image file, so you'll have to manually search and mount the file). This is the first 'disk'.

2. When prompted, manually find the second .bin file and mount. This is the second 'disk'.

3. Repeat step two when prompted, except this time find the final .bin file and mount. This is the final 'disk'.

4. When prompted, re-mount the first image file.

5. Upon completion, say no to creating a desktop icon and yes to installing DirectX and the Media one where it says you need it to play the game. Optional, but I'd say no to GameSpy Arcade as well.

6. In Windows Explorer, expand the first disk. There is a folder called 'Crack'. Copy the file inside and paste it inside your installation directory, which by default is C:/Activision/Rome Total War.

7. Say yes to replace the file

8. Launch the game!

As long as you meet the requirements for the game, and follow the steps in order, it should work fine. Any issues you encounter are not with the torrent or the uploader, it's most likely with your system or the operator or a combination of both. When in doubt, start from scratch and try again."

I have tried running in compatibility mode for Windows XP sp3, and in admin mode but it still gives me the error. Any clues on how to fix this? "
