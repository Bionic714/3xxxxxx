Spring folders is a simple, and effective program to give the winodws user a feel of srping loaded folders on MAC OSX. This application was made back in the days and is now discontinued.. i had searched for it for about 1-2 years, and never found the damn thing, but last night, i had luck. I want to share it so people don't waste time on trying to find.

the file is around 65 Kb.

have fun!
