,Rock-a-bob,2007-06-27T19:51Z,please help me seed these rare and rockin tunes for at least 24 hours after you have downloaded
,alcocops,2007-06-28T04:17Z,"Will be happy to oblige if the download ever completes, Bob. Currently stuck at 43.7% along with many other leechers. Are you seeding 24/7?"
,Rock-a-bob,2007-06-28T09:57Z,"changed speed on bit torrent. all should seed better now, sorry for the wait"
,alcocops,2007-06-28T23:41Z,"No, it's still s-l-o-w. Have only progressed to 50.3%. Are you running too many torrents at once, Bob? Might be best to wait until others are seeding this before uploading any more.
Would appreciate some Percy Mayfield in future if you're still taking requests."
,alcocops,2007-06-29T17:43Z,"OK, it's all complete now. Have already seeded around 250% but I'll keep it going a while longer as requested. Thanks for this one, Bob."
