Delete older keyfile?"
,Pictureman2,2007-06-26T10:08Z,"THANKS RSiP !!! It now works with the keygenerator...it is so nice to see its own name in the program :o)
Had to delete the entire installation and remove the .ini-file. Install it again and then use your keygeneratior....and now it works great ! Thanks for your job"
