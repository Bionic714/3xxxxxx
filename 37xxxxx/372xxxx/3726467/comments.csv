,Avenget,2007-06-28T04:18Z,"Thanks, but I meant more like a soundfont sequencer, or synthprogram that handles soundfonts, Windows-compatible..."
,donpedro,2008-01-13T15:35Z,"Dual or live boot something GNU'ish, try software like Rosegarden, QSynth, Ardour and about 10+ really good tools for synthesizing and sequencing, all interconnected with Jack. It's all free and all good.
Might be some of these things are ported to Windows too, I dunno..."

Yes, FL Studio can open the .sf2 files. Just copy them to the Soundfonts folder in your program directory. You will have to unpack the .sfpack files with a Soundfont unpacker. Search on Google and you'll find many utilities which can do that.

Many thanks to Avenget for uploading this excellent collection."

,Avenget,2008-08-04T07:51Z,The soundfonts called Acoustic Piano and Acoustic Guitarr are from magix music maker 2005 btw...
,manicruse,2008-08-16T02:42Z,"Does this package include any electric bass or piano soundfonts (other than the aforementioned magix acoustic)? I already have some really nice ones, like Splendid 72 MB and was just wondering.

Thanks"
,Avenget,2008-10-04T21:30Z,"Yes, the 105 mg real soundfont (Or what's it called) has some nice ebass, one called natural finger bass and one called Ibanez Picked Bass (very nice) and the acoustic piano also has a great, very soft piano sound, almost dreamish. For other very nice piano, search for the M-Audio Key Rig VSTi (a VST/Standalone synth with a normal GM module, top quality piano module with a number of patches, and a Drawbar Organ module which very accurately emulates a real organ."
,swaggger,2008-10-05T11:43Z,how do you unpacked this and put it into fruity loops 8 can someone please tell and break it down step by step pleeeaassse
,LoonyJ,2009-05-08T09:22Z,"@ swaggger:

All you have to do is import the files to 
C:\Program Files\Image-Line\FL Studio 8\Data\Patches\Packs\""your sub-folder(s)""
It's that simple. Happy beat making.
