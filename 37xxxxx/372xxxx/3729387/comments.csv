,Uncle_Ian,2007-10-23T22:40Z,"What a frustrating download.  The two ""seeders"" have themselves so throttled that I've been stuck at 99.9% for hours now. 

Rest assured that if I *ever* get to 100% that I AM THE ONE sharing this video.  Everyone else who gets 100% as a result has a moral obligation to continue my good work!!!!!"
,Uncle_Ian,2007-10-23T23:07Z,"My download is complete and I am seeding.  The vid looks very good- Eddie & The Cruisers, the first movie, not the sequel. 

I'll seed this for a while, courtesy of my high bandwidth, but the rest of you MUST continue sharing it after that. 

Like our parents taught us early on, it's nice to share."
,Uncle_Ian,2007-10-25T03:11Z,"Almost 24 hours later I continue to seed, and while I note that some have finished their download and then disconnected, others continue to seed.  Good for you! 

This file looks and sounds great- it's well worth downloading and well worth sharing."
,Roach Brothers,2008-01-26T12:51Z,Thanks for the up ....  Do You have EDDIE LIVES ....Eddie And The Cruisers 2 ????  I've seen it but would like to add it to my collection
,intoxicatedemon,2008-07-26T08:36Z,"I will keep seeding this for a few days. It's now 2008, so if anyone is paying attention, I'll be seeding."
,intoxicatedemon,2008-07-26T08:38Z,"Maybe I will seed. Now that I hit the download link, there are no people on here seeding it. So, unless I get a chance to DL it, I will not be seeding. "
