"THE PIANO TUNER OF EARTHQUAKES is the breathtakingly beautiful and long-awaited second feature from the Quay Brothers. On the eve of her wedding, the beautiful opera singer Malvina is mysteriously killed and abducted by a malevolent Dr. Droz. Felisberto, an innocent piano tuner, is summoned to Droz?s secluded villa to service his strange musical automatons. Little by little Felisberto learns of the doctor?s plans to stage a ?diabolical opera? and of Malvina?s fate. He secretly conspires to rescue her, only to become trapped himself in the web of Droz?s perverse universe...

Starring Amira Casar (Catherine Breillat?s ANATOMY OF HELL), Assumpta Serna (Pedro Almodovar?s MATADOR), Cesar Sarachu (INSTITUTE BENJAMENTA) and Gottfried John (Fassbinder?s MARRIAGE OF MARIA BRAUN)."
