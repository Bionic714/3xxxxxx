All the extras were stripped (only director's commentary left, if one can count it as extra). I suspect there were also Portuguese menu which was stripped (When first play you have a language option choice, and there is Portuguese. Apart from English and Spanish). Same applies to Portugues subtitles for main feature - probably stripped. So why to leave Portuguese sub for director's commentary is beyond my comprehension.
In spite of all these critical remarks, the movie is nicely ripped, no problems with video, audio or subs"
