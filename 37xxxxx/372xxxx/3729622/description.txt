Synopsis
Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell star as Ray Tango and Gabe Cash, rival LA policemen with one thing in common: each thinks hes the best. Together theyre like oil and vinegar... but frame them for murder and they explode into action like a match and kerosene! The two deliver sweaty excitement, double sex-appeal and outrageous laughs, in a daring prison break-out with a breathless rush of weapons and wise-cracks. Jack Palance plays it with relish as the shadowy crimelord who set them up.
