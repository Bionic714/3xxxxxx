College has always been a time for experimentation, sexual, cultural and otherwise. Toback's "Black and White" gave us the freshest recent perspective on hip college life and how kids deal with identity in today's rapid paced, morally ambiguous, sexually charged, multi-cultural society. "Harvard Man" is also played out against a background of love, sex, basketball, crime and experimentation. It is an ambitious work of action, philosophy and cinematic content that explores what today's young people go through on their quest to discover their true identity.

Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a Holy Cross cheerleader named Cindy who is dating the point guard for the Harvard basketball team. Her father is a mob boss, and she gets her boyfriend Alan (played by Adrian Grenier) mixed up in sports betting. Joey Lauren Adams plays Alan's philosophy professor with whom Alan's got something going on the side. Eric Stoltz is an undercover FBI agent infiltrating Cindy's father's mafia operations. Rebecca Gayheart plays Stoltz' co-FBI agent/girlfriend, and Ray Allen plays Grenier's Harvard teammate.
