,DoctorMe,2007-12-29T08:50Z,"Downloaded it. It works perfectly, it's the full registered version."
,eusuntsiva,2008-01-08T16:46Z,I hope it dose note sounds stupid but it has al so games (rooms) in it?
,the1silverwolf,2008-01-20T00:44Z,This is the engine only.  It does not include any roms.  But a google search for tg16 or pc-engine roms will point you to a ton of roms.
,sctirvn687,2008-04-06T11:32Z,lying bastards! This is the demo version!
,sctirvn687,2008-04-07T08:01Z,Disregard my last comment. I apologize. I tried it again and it is the full version. I deleted the reg file by mistake and that made it work as demo only. Thanks for the torrent!
,_AKUMA_,2008-04-17T20:57Z,"bah torrents for this sort of thing are dumb.  In 45 seconds you too can have this emulator without needing a torrent:

megaupload dot com/?d=Q2WGIK7U

no pass, and it's full;)

change ""dot"" to a real dot.  fucking shit cant post links yet i seen other people do it here.  all i get is ""Database error"" every time."
,_AKUMA_,2008-04-17T21:01Z,"oh btw, for all the roms you need go to ""planetemu dot net"";)"

That's a very closed minded and simplistic way of looking at things.  You are assuming that the pirate bay community ads nothing, when in fact the comments for any torrent are extremely valuable.  They give people an opportunity to discuss the validity of any download, report any threats, and share information.

Furthermore, File Download services like Mega upload delete files when they haven't been downloaded in a short time, they also might decide to take it offline for any reason at all, legal threats, etc....

Posting a torrent on Pirate Bay ensures the survival of this download, as long as the community wants to keep it going it keeps going.

The fact that this torrent is nearly 2 years old now and there are still seeders, is a perfect example of this.

If you'd rather trust some random sudo-anonymous company with your precious data then go right ahead, but don't you dare criticize those of us that know better.

B.T.W. STOP SWEARING IN A PUBLIC FORUM! THIS DOWNLOAD IS LIKELY TO BE READ BY YOUNGER PEOPLE AND OR CHILDREN SINCE IT IS ABOUT GAMES OR A GAMING PLATFORM.  PLUS, IT JUST MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE THE RETARDED COUNTRY YOKEL THAT YOU PROBABLY ARE."
,Mousse420,2009-10-18T10:42Z,"when i go to regedit and try to import that reg file, it says its going to replace ""my computer"" and delete anything under it, which is everything. What is going on here? is it going to destroy my computer? You all sound like you've done it but even so its scary since it reallly looks like that's what it will do"
,SS4Moku,2010-10-04T04:06Z,Does it come with the file needed to play CD-rom games?
,sugarfree1223,2012-05-10T01:04Z,Works great!!! Thanks for the up!
,Dabeavis,2012-06-21T05:23Z,"Could somebody make a torrent for one that is already cracked, for whatever reason my computer does not recognize PCE.reg as a Registry file, so I can't use that to crack it."
,Dabeavis,2012-06-21T05:49Z,"Nevermind my last comment, I just didn't understand how .KEY files work until now."
