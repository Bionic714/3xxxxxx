,eloman101,2009-03-01T09:46Z,"Thanx man. And for the dudes who don't know how to install the refill, here is what you have to do:
1. Unrar the files
2. just copy the refill and paste it in the reason  folder which is found in the program files/propellerhead/reason directory in your hard disk.
reason then automatically recognizes the refill and you're good to go. enjoy! "
