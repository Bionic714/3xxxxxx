~ System33r Stealth Downloader ~

Thanks alot to my friend r3l4x for the base source



* What This Is... *

In simple terms: It is a Web Downloader. It can be used to download any file you wish from any 
website and then either execute it hidden, normal or just download the file without any execution.

It has the ability to temporarily disable more than 800 Firewalls and
Anti-Virus programs/services (They are all encrypted...)

Server can, if defined, delete itself after execution. You also have the ability to pack it
with either fsg or upx. The Server Builder has a sleek interface and is easy to use.

* Extension Hint *

Since these days its getting more and more difficult to find webservers who allow hosting of
Win32 PE (EXE) files, so heres a little trick to bypass that:
Just change the extension of your exe file to something else for instance system33r.jpg and
upload it to your webhost. And in SSD when you add a new URL/Download just specify 
http://you.yourhost.com/system33r.jpg and most importantly the local filename would be
something like system33r.exe, don't forget that. SSD will download the system33r.jpg file and
execute it as an Win32 PE (executable) File - Just don't forget to save the local filename to
system33r.exe, for instance =)

something added which isn't already.

* AV-issues: *

None, I hope. It will of course be detected once the spies has gotten their hands on it, though


* Compability Issues: *

Hopefully none. I've implemented much error handling, which increased the size somewhat more
