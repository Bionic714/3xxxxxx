So much for that!"
,k0nsl,2007-06-27T15:41Z,"Perhaps because I made this tool/application in 2004? Yes, that might be why. I don't have time to recompile undetected copies at this time."
,cfghyt,2007-06-27T15:42Z,"Well then there is no point downloading it, no-use!

,k0nsl,2007-06-27T15:47Z,"It isn't difficult to make undetected if you have just one iota of intelligence. Of course, you don't have to download it, for the reason that you probably have no idea of what it can be used for and you probably have no knowledge of how one make it undetected either."

i'am not that dumb, but in your release it says:

Undetected from ALL anti-virus software! (I hope), maybe update it one bit, encrypt & scrable it, & release it over again!"

W0W. You are so l33t and as you said, we are all so ignorant.

But if you ARe so l33t, then why is it you don't also know that since this proggie is of NO value to practically everyone @ TPB, then it was a waste of your l33t time to upload it!!!

,k0nsl,2007-06-27T15:59Z,"cfghyt: You must be American. The readme was written in 2004. What part of that do you not understand? I should not have to speak in such simple terms, as if I was adressing a native from Uganda, should I? antamony: There is nothing 'leet' with this application and nothing of such nature has been claimed. I uploaded it for purely nostalgic reasons and because someone may find it useful. I don't care about your opinion or your retarded companions - two simpletons who can't grasp even the most basic facts. Sometimes I wonder what is wrong with Americans."
,cfghyt,2007-06-27T16:33Z,"ehh. i am not an american ^^, lame conflict!"
,k0nsl,2007-06-27T18:13Z,That's even worse then...(ha ha ha).
,cfghyt,2007-06-27T19:25Z,"haha, really funny *sarcasm*, *rasist*"
,k0nsl,2007-06-28T14:29Z,"Hoho so funny, so funny *antisemite*..."
