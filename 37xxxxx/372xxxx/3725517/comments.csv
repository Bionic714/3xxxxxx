,wankan,2007-07-01T23:09Z,"Um , it does seem a little daft? to utilise a high-speed-distribution model such as bittorrent and then spend (so far) 5 days to up the file . I take it the file is total crap and a MPAA dummy ?
No ?"
,wankan,2007-07-05T18:29Z,"Good film , it is The Gauntlet .
Thanks ."
,RubberTow,2007-08-19T07:34Z,"It ain't a dummy and it's a good rip or I wouldn't upload it. The Gauntlet and Outlaw Jose Wales are my favorite Eastwood flicks and the best of the 70s. TheGauntlet is underrated and not even carried by most disk rental companies. I was lucky to get it. Besides, the MPAA isn't going to dummy a 30-year-old movie. that trick is reserved for new releases like Million-Dollar Baby and the oceans tirlogy and Madona albums."
,holyghost1,2007-11-24T20:24Z,one more mirror movie put hell of this people how just destory.. it not imposible to track you RubberTow .....
,RubberTow,2007-12-01T06:40Z,"I can't beleive the stupid assholes that leave comments here expecting, just because they have high speed cable, to download a movie in a frigging half hour or some stupid shit, like all I got to do with my bandwidth is feed one stupid assed idiot one movie. It takes me days and weeks to download every movie I get except for ones ripped by AXXo and using BearShare that I can get over night because there is always 75-500 people sharing the file. Earth to fucking idiots: If I'm the only seed, then you can't get it at 200 mp per frigging hour and your stupid asses are just going to have to wait for it!"
[V],sailo,2008-03-25T08:37Z,"WELL SAID, RubberTow , thanks, hope this stay alive forever."
,rubrtoe,2008-11-24T23:45Z,"To wwwired : How about you paying my fucking cable bill and my Netflix rental and get me t1 cable while you are at it, dipshit. i got more things to do with my bandwidth than feed your sorry ass. I give the highest priority to my ups, so fuck the fuck off, fuck."
