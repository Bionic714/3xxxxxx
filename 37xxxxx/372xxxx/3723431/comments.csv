,carnage69,2007-11-07T03:25Z,"i downloaded this before, same ISO and burned it directly onto a dvd9 and it doesn't play the majority of the episodes. any other recommendations or has anyone else had this same problem?  i'm trying it again and going to load it onto a virtual drive and play the iso first so see if it works even on that first."
,mage711,2007-11-17T03:37Z,"For some reason. This torrent kept on stopping for no reason. It might have been because I wasn't uploading, but I just started the download. After 5 mb's we downloaded, it just stopped. I had to restart the torrent 3 times. >."
,Aaronb1215,2007-12-06T13:37Z,"Is this worth bothering with?

Has anyone downloaded it and had it work out just fine?"
,red8,2007-12-29T13:34Z,"This torrent is alright. Except episodes 2-8, and 47 are really low quality. It's probably better to watch them on youtube."
,Twiggy-Ramerez,2008-01-05T06:02Z,SOME ONE PLZ SEED THIS!
,only-one-jack,2008-02-05T00:50Z,well im downloadin it ill replace the bad quality ones and start a new torent but i doubt it will do any good. . .
,only-one-jack,2008-02-06T03:04Z,"well guys 2-8 and 47 arnt to bad of quality they are a kinda rare form of .avi though. If it looks bad to u download the k-lite codec pack and that should take care of it. its a free download jest search it on google, and even if u didnt have a problem with these vids i'd recomend downloading k-like its a great codec pack. ill leave this thing seeding for a while enjoy guys :) its a great seres "

,gahwesik,2008-03-28T07:47Z,"theres 51 episodes not 50 episodes of eureka seven. the 51st episode is pretty much the same as episode 50, but follows the views and dialogs of other people in the series."
,coldkeyes,2008-05-25T04:17Z,"I have downloaded this before its clean of viruses, spyware, worms, trojans, and other internet threats."
