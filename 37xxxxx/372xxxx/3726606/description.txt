FSfreeware Las Vegas Photorealistic - Repack & Re-release By 108

Since I've never seen this posted anywhere, I assume this is fairly a hard-to-find scenery. I've thoroughly enjoyed it over the years, and thought I'd share it with you. It's not perfect, but it's the only KLAS photoscenery I've ever seen.

I use it in conjunction with some photoscenery extentions i've been developing, which cover areas south, from Boulder City to Jean, Sandy Valley to the southwest, & the Spring Mountains to the west, including Mt. Charleston. I hope to release these soon, as they really add an amazing level of realism to the area, but for now you've got some photoreal Las Vegas airspace to fly around in. :-)

Enjoy!
