,chaliceofweewee,2007-06-29T19:40Z,My pleasure. You're probably aware but there's a great Loudon documentary on YouTube at the minute. It's a Dutch documentary but it's all in english and probably the most indepth I've seen over the years.

,chaliceofweewee,2007-06-29T21:04Z,I do indeed!! I'll get that on asap. Cheers.
