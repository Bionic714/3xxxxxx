Well, I already put up part one and three so here is the missing part 2 :P

Guess I'll take a break from uploading now. 



For patches made by a fan go here: http://vogons.zetafleet.com/gkpatches/

(These patches let u install the game on any windows machine, removes the annoying interlace when the movies are shown in GK2, Lets u burn t┬┤GK2 on one DVD instead of the 6 CD's and fixes some bugs.)
