,rjrichar40,2008-02-23T21:43Z,"I'm newbie enough and can't figure this out.  I can load/play 1 disc and play the first part, but then it asks me to insert disc 2.

I have all the disc images downloaded, but maybe I am not loading/installing them correctly. 

I have enough HD space.  So, more direction would really help.

Any ideas?  I would be most thankful.  I played this game when it came out and I really enjoyed it...  Would love to see it again."
,ursak,2008-04-28T23:04Z,"Seriously, guess... U change cd to cd 2 of course."
