Many people pass it off as noise and it is if you dont understand it, which took me alot of time and effort, especially with todays MP3's instead of analog Vinyls which affect the body in a fantastic way. =)

I read that this show according to one guy contains the best Hey Joe that Hendrix ever performed, I cant wait to hear it. I will listen to the album from beginning to end and probably cry like a bitch at some point =D

Anyway, know what this is, appreciate it and enjoy it =D"
