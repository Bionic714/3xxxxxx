The third part of the Gabriel Knight series. 

I still haven't found part 2 anywhere so if anyone 
is sitting on a copy, please let me know!




Storyline:

"Welcome to the remote French village of Rennes-Le-Chateau. Gabriel and Grace arrive in this small village in pursuit of a kidnapped child, but a deeper, far more frightening story begins to unfold. Whispers of a sacred bloodline, vampires and a boundless treasure set the shadow hunter and his companion on an inescapable path. Their ultimate destiny is to solve a dark mystery held secret for thousands years."
