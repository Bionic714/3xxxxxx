This is an edit of Reservoir Dogs, its intent is to keep to film on track with no down time.

Short form: I cut most/all character development from film and rearranged the scenes into chronological order.

Long Form: Cut - 1. Flashback to Mr. White character development.
2. Flashback to Mr. Blonde talkin to Joe and Eddie.
3. Flashback to Mr. Orange and all his undercover cop
scenes.
4. The scene where Mr. White and Mr. Orange are
scoping out the place they're gonna rob.

All Scenes placed into chronological order the best way i
thought they fit together.

The whole process took one week since i am fairly new to editing video.

The end product turned out just as i envisioned it. maintaining full dvd quality.
