Remembering Makaveli 3

This may be not the original RM3 but a bootleg of a bootleg. The videos are the same though, it has animated menu. I'm not sure which version is this but probably the NTSC vers.

I got to thank all the guys who support my blog, especially for Legendz662 who helps me seeding this.

I ask all of you to seed this as long as possible.
