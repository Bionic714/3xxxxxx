Breed... Aliens - get lost!  
This is your one and only thought upon your return to Earth in the year 2610. 
Commanding humankind's lone surviving battleship, you are forced to realize that 
the devastating war the BREED waged in the distant Besalius system was nothing 
other than a diversion. 

While the battle was raging far away, the aggressive aliens took over Earth.
Now is the time to come to the aid of your home planet. 

Enter the world of CDV's first-person shooter and search for survivors to organize
resistance. Discover your oppressors' weaknesses and strike at them without mercy. 

Your suicide squad has only one goal: to annihilate the BREED!

Breed is a cutting-edge science-fiction shoot-em up,
which skilfully blends addictive, accessible, free-roaming
gameplay with cutting-edge, state-of-the-art technology to

take control of a variety of units and vehicles ? from standard

Halt the invasion of The Breed and stop the destruction of mankind.
