,JAR_1,2009-04-12T01:41Z,"I used to love this game, and I wouldn't mind play it once in a while, but it comes (originally) with a StarForce copy protection engine which runs a stealth driver installation that takes over your CD rom and makes it sort of run the equivalent of driving a car in first gear ALL THE TIME. Eventually, your CD ROM dies, apparently for no reason. It ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO ME TWICE.

So, my question is:

Does this torrent have the StarForce engine removed?"
