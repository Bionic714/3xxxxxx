,dwatch,2007-06-24T17:55Z,"Yea, Die Hard 3 was released 12 years ago, see the IMDB link. Die Hard 1 was set in the skyscraper in LA, Die Hard 2 was set in the Airport near Washington D.C., Die Hard 3 was set all over New York City. Overall, Die Hard 3 was better than DH 2, but not as good as DH 1.

Can't wait for DH 4 to hit theaters in a few days!"
