,Feanoir,2007-07-03T01:13Z,"Sounds like a wrong version or the missing of your Bink drivers, try downloading their latest version.

,Feanoir,2007-07-03T22:42Z,"I did a little research on some sites for the same problem and it came all down on the replacement of the Binkw32.dll file.
I made a little torrent and found a link (watch your clicks, they can spawn spam :).
You should replace (always back-up ;P) the binkw32.dll from the GAME directory with the one attached :)

That should work... *hope*

The Torrent:

Good luck!"

,shyster002420,2008-02-22T22:43Z,"The reason you can't run the game when you update it from the CIV website is that the updated application is looking for the original game CD, which of course you don't have :).... go to gamecopyworld.com, where you can find cracked application files, usually around 40 megs, to replace the exe that won't look for that CD"

,Kennes99,2008-08-18T08:32Z,"Ok finally got it working.  Here is what I did:

1. Mount Image and Install
2. Download 1.61 Patch and install
3. Go to Gamecopyworld and get the 1.61 nocd crack (pcg-ec61.rar), the old crack had a bug where the game would crash after 10 turns.
4. Play

Do NOT replace the binkw32.dll file. That whole avenue is a waste of time.  If you have replaced the file you need to uninstall before starting step 1 above."

I had the same problem as you at the beggining so I'll help you. Read the 2nd comment page, 2 people talk about the 1.61 patch, install that patch and look for another crack that isn't in the torrent, there's a link to the crack, on the website look for =
Civilization IV v1.61 [ENGLISH] No-DVD/Fixed EXE
click on the floppy disk pic (on the bottom of your browser you should see the file name wich is pcg-ec61...)
It works fine for me this way, but I don't plan to play online so I don't know if it works with this patch version. probably not.

people read the other comments, this may really help you."

i installed, mounted, patched and dled the other file, but i wasnt putting the 2nd file, the exe into the MAIN folder, which if found somewhere like program files/firaxis games/civ 4.

find that folder, cut and paste the exe thats already there to a safe place, then add the cracked exe in it's place.
