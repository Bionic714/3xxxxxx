[T],PeteSapai,2010-11-08T16:29Z,"Ok, first the negative (only positive critisism :)):
- Even 3 year old mp3s should not be 128k cbr :p
- track 2 has no tag and its title is wrong (Samas in stead of Samus)
- track 2 has a nasty glitch at 3s73
- 4: noRfair
Other than that, awesome game and music, good upload!"
