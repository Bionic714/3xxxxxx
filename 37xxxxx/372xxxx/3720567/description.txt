Here you go. One of the best adventure games ever created.

I released this on Pirate Bay a long time ago and now Im doing it again. 
Why? Because first of all, it's so great! Second, I inkluded an installer this time that lets you install the game on any windows system from 95-XP and at the same time fixes alot of bugs in the game.


Enjoy

THE PLOT

In Sins of the Fathers, the first game in the series, we meet Gabriel Knight, a charming and rakish writer from New Orleans, who manages to survive by running a rare book shop called St George's. His nights are tormented by a recurring nightmare depicting a mysterious tragedy set in the past, which ends with his death; in addition to this, his newest novel with a voodoo theme is not proceeding as he would like.

His situation changes radically when he follows the track of a series of brutal murders taking place in the city - murders which seem to be linked to the ancient New Orleans voodoo cult. Hoping to get some inspiration for his book, Gabriel starts investigating on his own and as the clues thicken, they seem to lead to Malia Gedde, an upper-class and inaccessible woman with whom Gabriel falls in love. But the clues also lead, surprisingly, to Gabriel himself. Is it coincidence or destiny?

A shadow lies on his family history, and the sins of the fathers will fall on their descendants. To save his life and those of his dear ones, Gabriel will have to confront his fate, and make the most difficult choice of his life.

"The game is addictive, highly playable, and downright creepy. Gabriel Knight is one of the few games that approaches the skill of the cinema in transporting you to another world." PC Zone (UK) Mar `94
