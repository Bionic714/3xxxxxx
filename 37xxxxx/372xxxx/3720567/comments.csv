I'm trying to install the game, but it says that can't find some .AVI files. actually, it can't find many files hehehehehehehehehe... when I ignore them, the game is installed, but doesn't play. can you give me a hand(is there such expression in US? I live in Brazil.)?"

Try downloading an DOS emulator like dosbox (just google for it :)) and I think it will work. 

This as most games I'v uploaded are tested and works on my old 486 PC. "
