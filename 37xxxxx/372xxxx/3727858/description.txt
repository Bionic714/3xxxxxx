When one of the players reaches $0 he has to take off one piece of clothing,
which gives him an additional $100. Each time your opponent does this you?re
rewarded with a new sequence of his stripping, which obviously gets better
the farther you get. 

This continues until, well, your opponent is naked.

Of course, since this is a game only you can basically just sit there for as long as you want, without taking off any clothes at all. ;-)

Also, if you only get lousy cards you can simply restart the match and get all your money back.

Isn?t life grand?
