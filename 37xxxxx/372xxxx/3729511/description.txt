Install and connect to WowScape Private Server.
(WowLegion Realm) BlizzLike


[First Step]
You WILL need to register an account on the WoWlegion Server to login and start playing.
To do this, please use this link (http://www.wowscape.net/?act=Register) 
All browsers work on our custom account registration system.

 - IT WILL TAKE UP TO 10 MINUTES FOR YOUR ACCOUNT TO BECOME CREATED ON THE SERVER!

[Second Step]
Install "The Burning Crysade" (Dont start game or any auto update from blizzard after install)

Now you need the patches..

As WoWscape is supported only on 2.1.1 World of Warcraft version.
You will need to make sure you have this version to play on WoWscape.

Go patch up to the patch called "2.1.1" !

I put all the patches in directory. Make sure to install them in the order they are listet (By number)

1: Wow 2.0.3.6299.
2: Wow 2.0.3 - 2.0.12.6546.
3: Wow 2.0.12 - 2.1.0.
4: Wow 2.1.0.6629 - 2.1.0.6739. 
(If you wanna use the Hacks this is were you stop patching. Dont install the next one cause the hacks only works on this. My advice is stop hacking! And play fair.
5: Wow 2.1.0.6729 - 2.1.1.6739.

- Done with that.
Just keep an eye on the WowScape forums for new updates and everything server related (http://forums.wowscape.net/)


[Third Step]
You're almost close to being connected to WoWscape now.
In this step, you will need to download the WoWscape Server Browser, which will automatically modify your files to run WoWscape.

You can download the WoWscape Server Browser by using this link (http://forums.wowscape.net/index.php?showtopic=8433)

If for some reason the official WoWscape Server Browser does not work for you, you may always manually modify your files to connect to WoWscape.
To do this, please follow the following steps:

1.) Go to your World of Warcraft directory. The default directory is (C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft), but you may have installed it in another directory depending on your preferences.

2.) Open up the file named "realmlist.wtf" with any default text editor (Notepad) and replace the entire data in there with the following data:

                      "    set realmlist 75.126.214.118    "


3.) Double click "WoW.exe" and start playing WoWscape!



Congratulations! You have now successfully edited your World of Warcraft to connect to WoWlegion.
If you have any questions / comments, please post them on the forums.
