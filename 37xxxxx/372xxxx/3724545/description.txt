Instructions are simple:

1.  Install the SUPERantispyware.exe in this main folder.

2.  Close the program if it's running.

3.  Open the crack folder, and copy the crack file to the install directory which is probably
	 
	c:/Program Files/SUPERAntiSpyware/

4.  Optionally, you can rename the original superantispyware.exe to superantispyware.old before pasting the new file.

5.  Paste the cracked file into that directory.

Now when you open the program, you should be able to activate real-time scanning, as well as other functions not normally available in the free version.

My personal experience is that more and more ppl are using SAS to monitor intrusive actions.  I used Ad-aware for years, but recently, SAS found additional problems after Ad-Aware said the computer was clean.  So I thought I'd share it.

Oh, and I don't take credit for anything except putting the two files together in one working package and sharing it.  

Enjoy.
