,henke_friend,2007-07-02T11:57Z,Hey when i start the game it says that the d3dx9_30.dll is missing  =/   is there anyone that know what i can do ?  
,henke_friend,2007-07-03T13:44Z,Ahh thank you very much ! =)
,Mulleboy,2007-07-04T00:12Z,Can anyone confirm that they see the cutscene videos in this release? I downloaded and have played this release by Dopeman but I dont see any cutscenes =(
,Mulleboy,2007-07-04T07:22Z,"Alright appearantly there are no cutscenes in this release of the game, which makes the entire story mode useless, seeing how the entire game is bound  by the cutscenes. They tell the story, you drive da car. Fancy lookin game tho, good job on rippin it Dopeman but make sure to keep us warned next time."
,Mulleboy,2007-07-06T18:25Z,"### BIG WARNING:
This rip is useless! The cutscenes are missing so the story mode is COMPLETELY fucked up. You dont know shit about anything, you're basically just ""driving around"" doing something you dont know anything about. Complete shit.

Sorry Dopeman, I know you're one of the best but this was just plain crap m8.."
,Mulleboy,2007-07-09T16:51Z,"lol, still 360+ people downloading this shit EVEN THO IT DOESNT HAVE ANY CUTSCENES.."
,limewireX2,2007-07-09T21:28Z,is this torrent the complete game or is it only crap as mulle says ?
,Mulleboy,2007-07-10T05:29Z,"@limewireX2

Yes, It's true what I say. I've reinstalled and doublechecked everything. There aren't even any cutscene files in the folders where the cutscenes should be. It's the complete game without any cutscenes, so Single-player (which is the only mode) is useless and nonunderstandable.

,Painkiller911,2007-07-10T12:46Z,"!Help me. I download this file and works. But when ýou go to the ""shooting training"" and you shoot the cars tyres, then the man says failed. What i need to do?"
,Mulleboy,2007-07-10T20:17Z,"@painkiller:
target the car first, then click ""free-aim"" button.
Then shoot the tyres."

 Greetings fellow pirates.

 There is indeed a new enemy amongst torrents and they are trying to control
 all good gaming torrents everywhere. Leeching and dumping data, not sharing
 a bit of data, which is making it near impossible to download many torrents.

 I have included a dopeman_blocklist.txt file. YOU MUST load this file to
 Peerguardian as an addtional blocklist -or- load the file to whatever means
 of IP blocking you have available to your BT Client.

 If you do not, you will simply be sharing data to these cowards and not other
 legit torrent users trying to download. 

 Please try to understand the importance of this. It must be used to begin
 saving game torrents everywhere. This is a new enemy. We must do our best 
 to fight back to preserve our freedom of sharing. 

 Please use the blocklist and share it anyway you can.

 dopeman"

Why dont you try any other .exe.There are rare cases in which it runs the game.
