Keep those prying eyes out of your communications and prevent unwanted people from reading your private files!



Invisible Secrets 4 not only encrypts your data and files for safe keeping or for secure transfer across the net, it also hides them in places that on the surface appear totally innocent, such as picture or sound files, or web pages. These types of files are a perfect disguise for sensitive information. Nobody, not even your wife, boss, or a hacker would realize that your important papers or letters are stored in your last holiday pictures, or that you use your personal web page to exchange messages or secret documents. With Invisible Secrets 4 you may encrypt and hide files directly from Windows Explorer, and then automatically transfer them by e-mail or via the Internet.



Invisible Secrets 4 features strong file encryption algorithms (including AES - Rijndael), a password management solution that stores all your passwords securely and helps you create secure passwords, a shredder that helps you destroy beyond recovery files, folders and internet traces, a locker that allows you to password protect certain applications, the ability to create self-decrypting packages and mail them to your friends or business partners, a tool that allows you to transfer a password securely over the internet, and a cryptboard to help you use the program from Windows Explorer. Invisible Secrets 4 is shell integrated and offers a wizard that guides you through all the necessary steps needed to protect your data.
