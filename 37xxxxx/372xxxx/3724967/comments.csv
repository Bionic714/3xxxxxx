,TunTuri,2007-12-10T09:35Z,"Too bad, I wished that this would have included the followin rare extol tracks: Vicious Intent, Christianity Misunderstood and Seek the Righteous ...They aren't available anywhere, not as files nor on any cd. I wish I lived in norway, I think those tracks would be available there in some music shop."

,xPANSYx,2008-03-16T22:22Z,"If you like christian metal like extol, you should check out Crimson Moonlight, The Agony Scene, Antestor, Demon Hunter, Drottnar and Pantokrator. They are really great."
