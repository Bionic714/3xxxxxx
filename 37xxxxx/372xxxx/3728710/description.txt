Yod'm 3D is a virtual desktop manager with the fashionable effect : the cube

Very similar to Compiz as seen on Linux.

This is freeware but the reason I put it here is because the download on the site often cuts out due to too many downloads.

Languages : English, French, German, Italian, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Danish, Japanese, Spanish, Czech, Portuguese, Dutch, Hungarian, Polish, Russian, Catalan, Korean, Slovak, Swedish, Turkish, Finnish
