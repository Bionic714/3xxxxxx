,claussanta7,2008-12-20T10:28Z,"English:
Great speed !! The only thing i want to know is if this game really works when its an .exe file? And can I choose Danish languages?

Dansk:
Super fart !! Det eneste jeg gerne vil vide er om dette spil virkelig virker når det er en .exe fil? Og kan jeg vælge dansk sprog?"
,claussanta7,2008-12-20T10:43Z,"English:
To mount meens to load your CD / DVD from your computer. When you got a mounting program you don't need a CD / DVD drive. You can load the games from your computer instead. A recommended mounting program is Daemon Tools. Get it here:
http://disc-tools.com/download/daemon/

Dansk:
At mounte betyder at kører dine CD / DVD fra din computer. Når du har et mounte program behøver du intet CD / DVD drev. Du kan køre fra din computer i stedet. Et anbefalet mounte program er Daemon tools. Få det her:

,Jay91,2009-06-08T20:55Z,"Ok, i registered myself to PB to tell how this torrent was and. IT WAS AWFUL! Why?
Cause:
- NO SOUND, JUST MUSIC.
- CONTROLS ARE FUCKED.
- RESOLUTION AT 800x400. "" We cannot change the graphic settings in the game ""

oh and to thoose who wonder, this EXE file is just a extractor which just unpacks the baddest files ever.

Thankyou but no thankyou for uploading this."
