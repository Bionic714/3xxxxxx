,stratusman,2009-04-14T19:29Z,thanks very much for seeding im at 99% and i will seed for very long time considering i found ppl still seeding such an old movie:)
,stratusman,2009-04-14T20:02Z,"OK works 100% no defects like alot of other copies have, PERFECT QUALITY for such an old movie couldnt ask for better, thanks alot m8:)...one more thing for some reason i could only get it to work on media player classic but then again i am not on my pc so codecs might have been the problem...either way it works and works great :):):)"
