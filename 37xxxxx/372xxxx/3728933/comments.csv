I tested a couple of my rips in my divx/dvd player, a Toshiba, which I bought last Xmas at BJ's Wholewale club last Christmas.  My rips play fine in my player, which I purchased long before this version of the Divx codec was released. Also, there is no software updating service available with my player.Therefore, all I can say to people who have Divx players that won't play this is: you bought the wrong brand."

I tend to rip them in larger resolutions, especially old movies,because when the video is expanded to fit the tv screen, it also enlarges any flaws in the video. So the bigger the original, the less it has to increase in size to fill the screen and the smaller the flaws stay."
