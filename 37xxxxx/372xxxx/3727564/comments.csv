Probably the finest song and video I have ever heard or seen in my life.  
To quote Little Richard ""Johnny Cash is Rock & Roll. Johnny is the Blues, Johnny is Country and Johnny is Soul.  Johnny Cash is all things to all men.""
I repeat this as as a die hard Rock fan, but Johnny Cash transcends all genres and tastes as The last Gunslinger The last Great American."
