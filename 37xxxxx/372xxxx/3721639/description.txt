No install necessary. Just click on the "Video Player" to start. Will play unRAR-ed archives (split or single) without joining ("File / Streaming from unrar" and then provide the password. If there is no password then leave the word PASS there). Opens cmd.exe in case you wonder what it's doing and it lists off everything about the file during playback. Close cmd.exe then the video stops obviously.

Works on everything I've tested so far. Interesting little app which is good for watching video (from lost split archives), secutiy testing and for having a quick look at a video file without running WinRAR.
