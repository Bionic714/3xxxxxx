2) If D3 is crashing on you, try using 16 bit instead of 32 bit, which is selected from the main screen > options > video page in D3... I just solved my crashing with D3 by doing this.  All other settings can be firewalled (set to max) ... I have an Athlon XP 3200+, 2GB RAM, BFG 6200 OC 256 AGP GFX card... so you should be able to set your settings to max as well, if you have anything near my system specs (heck, the game *is* 2000...)"
