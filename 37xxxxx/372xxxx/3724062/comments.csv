,Rixsta,2007-07-16T00:14Z,WTF is seeding? Help me...
,Fancyass,2007-07-27T15:30Z,Is there any Keylogger/Virus/Spywear or that sort of stuff in this torrent? Is the guide like Joanas Horde Guide or is it just a shity guide? And is it for Humans/Gnomes/Dwarfs/NE or Drienei? pls tell me!
,Djabber,2007-07-30T15:38Z,"This download contains a virus!!!!

DO NOT DOWNLOAD! "
,torbpet,2007-08-05T21:09Z,How can there be a virus in this dowload? It is a zip-file containing only htm-files and gif-images ...
,ulokye,2007-08-11T14:25Z,"Well I scanned the file and could not find a virus, but on the person that wondered ""how it could contain a virus because it was JUST html"" you need to read up on how computer work mate :)"
,killic,2007-09-22T09:45Z,yupp thats true
,Artaz,2007-10-10T22:02Z,"Just so that u know, the real Brians Guide is a .pdf file large about 40 MB or so, so this one can't exactly be the real thing."
,blitz1988,2007-11-02T13:35Z,"This is a ripped version in .html with .jpg pictures, therefore it takes up a lot less space...
I really don't understand people claiming that this ain't ""the real thing"" when they didn't even bother downloading it and seeing for themselves. It IS Brian's alliance leveling guide, and it has NO viruses/spyware/whatsoever in it."
,blitz1988,2007-11-02T13:39Z,"On a side note, if I wanted to spread viruses, why would I choose such an unpopular file which only WoW players know of?"
,oktan,2007-11-05T00:14Z,why wow? LOL . i guess wow dont have any players at all around the globe ey! 
,Drowuria,2008-01-12T02:08Z,"Well.. Sure.. Wow has about 9 million players or something, if I'm not misstaken. But it would be way smarter to spread a virus weaved into some porn tbh, since I assure you more than 9 million people watch porn :P blitz has a point. ty for sharing"
,BR41ND34D,2008-02-27T05:11Z,"@ twinsupra:
that must be the lamest way to get someones login/pw.
I didn't know Blizzard uses MS Live email accounts :/

@ ppl who doubt:
and btw this IS the real guide..."

,h412d,2008-03-27T04:36Z,"You dum shit, Djabber. Theres no Virus in a .html Doc, with Virus you at least need to see a exe. "
,Nohg,2008-07-28T21:43Z,""" thepirateway at 2008-04-03 21:35 CET:
there can be viruses embeded in html, why do you think they tell you to turn off html in email and not to click on links in emails?

Just sayin.""



Because you use Windoze. That's why."
