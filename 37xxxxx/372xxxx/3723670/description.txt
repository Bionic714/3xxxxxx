Well then, this is the final DVD I am uploading, due to the fact that the other series are far from worth it.. Fortunately, my upload limit increased with 200% lately, so it won't take as long as before.
I regret the fact S3D2 couldn't be uploaded by today so I hope to find one as soon as possible!

Thank you all for downloading all of these marvellous series, and for all your comments! My pleasure!

James Herriot
All Creatures Great & Small: The Complete Series 3, Disc 4 (DVD)

In 1937, a young, newly-qualified surgeon arrives in the picturesque village of Darrowby to take up his first job in the established veterinary practice of Siegfried and Tristan Farnon. But in rural Yorkshire, with few medicines available, the treatment of sick animals still seems to be rooted in the Dark Ages. This, together with the country-folk's inherent suspicion of strangers, poses problems for James Herriot in the early years of his career.
