INFO FROM WIKIPEDIA

The Dig is a graphical adventure game developed by LucasArts and released in 1995, and a novel based on the game written by Alan Dean Foster. It was the 11th game to use the SCUMM game engine, and is famous for its connection to Steven Spielberg, and notorious for its prolonged production, that had the game bordering on vaporware.

It is the most serious LucasArts adventure game, containing no slapstick, and relatively little subtle humor, an element found abundantly in all other LucasArts adventure titles. It is also the only one to perfectly fit into the science fiction genre.



Its great anyway, just search wikipedia for more info :)
