,Dragon.76,2007-07-01T02:42Z,So is this a ported version of Sheepshaver?
,alteregg,2007-07-02T09:59Z,"Thanks for great work, gwalkabout!!

A question:
What do you mean by ""Drag & Drop access to OSX"" ? (First I thought you could move FILES from OSX desktop to OS9 desktop...but that doesn't work for me)

What's the easiest way to move stuff between OS's ?

Once again, Thanks for a nice job!

thanks"
,SwBear,2008-04-21T11:56Z,"alteregg: open 'Preferences' in SS, choose a suitable folder in 'Unix Root'. This will become your shared folder between X and 9. DonÂ´t work with files in this folder under OS 9. Move them onto a 'Harddisk' before opening them.

rayboat: mount the Cd before starting SS, a bit awkward. If u need to change disks in SS, install 'Joliet Volume Access' in your emulated system. ItÂ´s an extension which supports other formats and some manipulation of diskmounting.

,killercatfish,2008-05-02T16:51Z,"Can anyone tell me how to get a game to work on this?  I desperately want to play that Pheta Spacestation game again!

When I get it into the applications folder it says could not find the program that created it!

Thanks!"
,Grom1,2008-07-27T06:23Z,"Hey. This little program is great. I'm running OS9 on my MacBook pro.
The only thing is I love Deus Ex and wanted to play it again...I can;t get it to run...it shuts down the entire OS9 window just before it starts...somethihng to do with the graphics I guess since the Sheepshaver OS9 doesn't recognize my graphics card as a 3D card.
Any suggestions ?"
,MrOmari,2008-12-28T06:10Z,Everything i was looking for was right here all along. Screw you gwalkabout for making me feel foolish
,killerzip,2008-12-29T22:40Z,Thanks! So much easier than Sheepshaver!
,ddrach,2009-01-13T10:41Z,"I'm also having trouble trying to play a game on here. I Installed HOMM 3, after toying around for awhile I figured out how to create a volume with about 800 MB's on it so I finally got the game installed. But when I go to run it I hear sound for like 2 seconds then get a blank screen. I don't know if I have it in the wrong spot or if something is config wrong"
