,r0b1nb4t3,2007-07-02T09:42Z,"If u can't wait, go to corel.com, download the trial and download the keygen from http://crackteam.ws/get.shtml?178006 - it's virus-free

,GN85,2007-09-06T23:33Z,"6) Enter the same key from the keygen and choose phone

Useless step, and in my case, doesn't even work."
,hammeredcats,2007-10-17T19:46Z,"This version does not work. It installs and activates per the instructions, but as soon as you turn your internet connection back on, it resets the activation and you're screwed. "
,Newb787,2008-02-15T02:35Z,That's too bad.  Looks like we're stuck with Version 12 for a while then.  It's only stupid Canadian companies and organizations who use Corel products anyways.

,greenbile,2008-03-27T04:50Z,"Works.  I followed instructions and after installing and uninstalling three times it worked and it was worth the hassle.  Here are instructions that worked for me.  I just downloaded corel x3 trial version from corel website and used this crack.  I did not download this application, just the crack. Before step one unplug internet connection because you want to tell corel you are activating by phone not by internet connection..

1. Start setup/install after unzipping the files
2. When the program asks for trial serial, start keygen and enter the serial under field ""already have trial serial""
3. DO NOT close or regenerate the serial in keygen.
4. Start program after installation
5. Click on ""Enter activation"" - do not click ""buy""
6. Click activate by phone.  When program asks for key, enter the serial earlier entered
7. In the keygen enter the number generated by Corel as installation code
8. Click Activate (DO NOT click generate)
9. Enter the activation code manually. Sounds goofy but wouldn't work by cut and paste.
10. Click on Continue and cross fingers.

If it doesn't work, uninstall and start over.  Good luck!"

,R.Rendall,2008-03-30T05:35Z,"The instructions by Greenbile do not work. If your internet is not available the software will not let you proceed from the page where you enter the serial (either trial or keygen).
At that point you're screwed."
,kornylak,2008-09-25T16:23Z,Serial number generator is good but can not activate.  I successfully used the serial to activate my OEM disk that had lost it's serial number and does not need activation.
