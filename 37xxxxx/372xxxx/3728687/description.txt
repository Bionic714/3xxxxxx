"Descent" complete soundtrack.

"The original soundtrack for Descent was written by several people at Interplay at times where Parallax Software did not yet have a composer. On the PC platform it is entirely in MIDI format. On the Macintosh, Interplay used digital music for the soundtrack: Professional Studio Mixes of the best of the PC soundtrack with guitars, drums, etc. . That soundtrack is a must-have for everybody who loves the Descent PC soundtrack." -- http://www.descent2.com/

Here is the CDA rip of the Mac release of the game. Enjoy!
