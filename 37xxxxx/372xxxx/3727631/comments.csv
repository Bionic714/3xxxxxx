,yandexx,2009-08-06T12:27Z,"You should NOT use this release, because:

1. This is free software and should be downloaded from the official website: http://foobar2000.org/
Also see http://www.foobar2000.org/?page=FAQ
2. This version is outdated (current is 0.9.6.8) and filled with outdated, likely unstable plugins.
3. This release violates foobar2000 license: a custom installer is used."
