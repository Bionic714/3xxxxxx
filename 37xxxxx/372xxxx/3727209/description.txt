Hey guys! Im uploading this torrent because i think there is not enough motocross and supercross torrents.. I mean someone has to start uploading it. if any of you has any motocross or supercross movies then upload it please..i will seed as much as i can. i have bar to bar supercross 2006,2005 and the national highlights of 2005 coming up for you if you upload any SX/MX torrents :D

Movie info : In the AMA Toyota National Motocross championship of 2006 we can see Ricky Carmichael and James Stewart battle it out on the rough tracks in the 250cc class, And Ryan Villopoto and Mike Alessi in the 125cc class. the files are at the size of aprox 7 gbs so you cant burn on a normal dvd disc (wich i think is pretty lame),so watch it on your computer.

This is my first torrent so im a noob in torrent uploading
