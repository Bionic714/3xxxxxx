In windows 98, 2000, ME, XP home, XP pro, XP media you put your files in this folder.
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\WorkshopData\48\

If your using windows vista you put them right in C:\

,Hacker-Man,2008-12-06T15:20Z,"Hi Guys.

I just made it work with Vista...

You install the program with the CD. 1-2-3.
the program will in the end of the installation come with an error.. Just Ignore that.
Next you 
unpack the Crack..
If you can see the files *.dll in the crack.rar file but when you unpack it, you canÂ´t see it.. 
Then you have to Close your Antivirus program.
Then you can see the *.dll file.

Then you take the Crack *.dll file and Copy it to your desktop.
Then you start The Vivid Workshopdata 
When the program starts it shows the program settings box.
Then Go to the Advanced part in the top.
Then in the Box Below under Library You select browse and then you find the *.dll file on your desktop and select it.
Now you program is Cracked...


Hope it Helps....


See Yahh"
