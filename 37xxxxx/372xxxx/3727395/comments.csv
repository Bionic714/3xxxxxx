,Reservoir69,2008-09-16T20:38Z,"Just a suggestion.  Don't rar all the files.  

1.  You can pick which files you want to download if they are separated.

2.  Easier to seed.  If you have to keep this huge rar file and use the files, it will double your hard drive space 8.44 gigs.

3  Everyone can see the files load before downloading.  Or you can list all of them but it will take a while to type.

Other than that....THANKS."

,phisig6057,2009-02-02T05:53Z,This looks like a great collection.  Thanks a lot I plan to seed this indefinitely once it downloads.
