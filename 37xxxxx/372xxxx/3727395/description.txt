In the spirit of the movie: "Pay It Forward" & 12-step programs such as: Alcoholics & Narcotics Anonymous, here's a collection of over 4gb of audio, video, & PDF files that I encourage you to "pay forward" by seeding at least 2 copies and/or burning 2 DVD's for anyone who would like help quitting smoking, drinking or drug use; would would like to look/feel great, lose weight, sleep better, etc. which is what?  Pretty much all of us? :)

Here's  a listing of just some of the files included:

AA Alcoholics Anonymous - various AA-related audio files such as "The Big Book"

Anthony "Tony" Robbins - Enhanced Life Quality, Unlimited Power, Personal Power 2, & Unleash the Power Within

Bill Phillips - Body For Life

Brain Sync - Stop Smoking & Total Relaxation

N.A. Speaker Tapes

Natural Cures & Lose 30 Pounds in 30 days by Kevin Trudeau

Paul Mckenna - Stop Smoking Audio CD

My Name is Bill W - video on the Beginnings of AA & the cofounders Bill W & Dr Bob


Again, I ask that you distribute/seed as many copies of this as you can & together we can help thousands of people worldwide with this information!

Thanks in Advance! :)
