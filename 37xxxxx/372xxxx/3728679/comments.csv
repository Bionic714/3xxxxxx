,kostas545,2007-06-30T16:42Z,o man this torrent is too big how many hours take to upload?
,Riverburn,2007-08-26T16:59Z,"you have my deepest thanks for including the japanese audio, the english one would have sucked so much that i think i would've deleted the whole thing"
,Kinokyo,2007-11-11T03:07Z,"how do you seed, i dont get that part yet, i wanna do it but i dont know how to do it? what do i need to do??"
,piook,2007-11-15T02:56Z,"Kinokyo,
You can seed simply by leaving your bit torrent client (uTorrent, Azerus, etc.) running after it completes a download. Once you have completed a download you are at that point seeding that torrent."
,pauldapigeon,2007-12-14T19:24Z,"yo!
i can't play the files. i have vlc player and it's supposed to play mkv files. do i need any codecs? "
,sknywhtboy88,2008-01-12T01:58Z,"you should put dragon ball Z up sometime in the same format. That would be awesome since this is such great quality. By the way to Pauldapigeon, if you havn't already found a suitable solution, I use BS player, it works well and it's free."
,gringr775,2008-01-28T07:32Z,"will seed infinitely, just like inuyasha"
,Johntheman,2008-02-03T00:18Z,"This is the best Dragon Ball torrent because you actually give the details. All the DBZ torrents make it impossible to find out if English or Jap, uncut or cut, Funimation or Ocean, and the quality. Thanks A Lot."
,umbbra,2008-02-05T17:55Z,"ppl please tell me where are the english subtitles(from description), I can`t find them. This pack has only the mkv files.
10x"
,umbbra,2008-02-06T10:07Z,...and the language is  only japanese
,lchupacabras,2008-02-29T03:49Z,"umbbra, it's an mkv file, there's more than one language encoded for it's use.

If you're using VLC (after installing all the needed codecs, I recommend the CCCP) just right click then click on ""audio"" or something along those lines to choose which audio stream to use. (Aka jap or eng)"
,Matiladir,2008-02-29T21:34Z,"These are MKV files. Theyre subtitled in English. Keep in mind theyre older subtitles..theyre not high quality. The grammar is 100x better then HK subs.

Please send! 3100% health and 0 KB?! CMON YALL! "
,Silas28,2008-04-04T17:38Z,please seed
,IceMaster,2008-04-24T01:38Z,"Episode #38 is damaged.  The audio is not in sync with the video.  I downloaded the file twice to make sure.

Also, there's a typo in the file name of #78."
,sb_k,2008-05-31T15:36Z,I dont get it my upload speed is 0 kbs if I try to download this file and my download speed is very low as well (sometimes 0 kbs as well) It is only with this torrent :(
,sb_k,2008-05-31T21:57Z,"nvm got it to work and its downloading right now :D

Ive seen a little bit but I have to say the quality is great :D thanks"

,skullsrs,2008-06-20T18:26Z,Thanks alot! the guality is great and the audio is also great. Thanks again
,Warganom,2008-07-14T19:21Z,"First, is there any way to remove a language? I wont watch it in english so it just takes place.

Second, is the subtitles translated japanese audio or is it a texted english audio?.. Hope you understood that. "
,Warganom,2008-07-15T14:45Z,"Hm?.. Are you sure there is subtitles to this?.. I use CCCP and it says I have subtitles activated, but there arn't any subtitles."
,Lan_57,2008-07-21T05:38Z,I cant open these files with VLC player anymore i was able up until episode 10 but now its not opening it any help plz
,kefiafusu,2008-09-06T06:54Z,"how long did it take to dl? i just started today, when am i expected to be done?"
,propalibasist,2008-10-10T17:39Z,"seeed please

,Frooogle,2008-12-23T19:22Z,come on guys........please seed......
,quazi87,2008-12-31T01:36Z,Anyone that knows why there are no subtitles even when you activate it from the toolbar?
,Frooogle,2009-01-02T00:07Z,try playing the vids using media plater classic from k-lite codec pack.it works just fine with subs without needing to activate them.but just one favor guys....please seed!!!!!!i'm downloading with just 5 kb/s the last 2 days!
,bonemeal,2009-02-01T19:08Z,"Episode 62 has wrong subs, and there are some episodes with bad sync in sound AND audio. Off by 1.3 sec or so, had to resync. Is there any better release or are there fixed episodes WITH seeds? :X"
,fl0ris,2009-03-30T19:18Z,please Seed
,unqjohnny,2009-12-28T11:32Z,"Thanks !
Very good quality !"
,Number1xer0,2010-02-15T14:37Z,yesyesyes your my hero im going to have a dragon marathon here real quick with this then dbz omg thanx
,scatteredblossom,2010-03-11T19:58Z,downloaded to Mac. Won't play with Quicktime even with Perian. won't play with VLC. copied 1st 2 episodes to memory stick and played 1st one okay on VLC on Windows but 2nd crashed after a few seconds. 153 episodes took an age to download. well pissed off. any ideas?
,Scarmiglione,2010-05-27T09:56Z,"@scatteredblossom  It's your own fault for using a mac.  People with macs *buy* stuff, piracy is for people with real computers.

Seriously, though, I doubt the codecs work on a mac,  these files probably aren't going to work for you."
,GDA9,2010-06-01T12:40Z,"Thanks for this!!!

SEED, SEED, SEED!"
,metalmallow,2010-06-12T23:01Z,"@Scarmiglione How stupid can you get? I bet you don't even own a Mac. I pirate loads of shit on my Mac.

@scatteredblossom Do a Google search for MPlayer OSX Extended. It should play these files just fine."
,chris[mufc]150,2010-06-14T16:00Z,The quality of this torrent is just perfect. Although it would be nice if it had more seeders. Thank you for the upload :D
,nevercominghome,2010-06-24T01:15Z,"Don't download. I download this whole torrent (took me 4 days, even with my laptop left on at night a few times), but anyway, some episodes are off sync (the first of which i found was episode 38), and you can find better quality on demonoid. Trust me.
This is okay quality if you're an average person, but if you're a dragonball fanatic like me then'll you'll go find a different torrent that also at least contains the intro too!"
,Flowzer,2010-06-29T12:15Z,"cmon guys, please seed :( can't even download one episode to check the quality"
,balkika,2010-11-10T20:38Z,"can any 1 tell me why i cant play this? i have ccp codec,  but it stop after few seconds. and start from the beginning"

,slitherhead,2011-01-18T12:08Z,Nice download. Watched the first 20 or so episode with subs and the next 20 with english audio. works just fine for me.
,b6f6Lb4u,2011-02-06T19:33Z,"Some videos have issues : 10,18,38,62,82,91,116,124,138,140,143. Get the fixed versions from the ""[A-Supreme] Dragon Ball (complete uncut version,mkv,h264)+FixEps"" torrent : http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5003725"

,DBZ-Fan,2011-04-02T14:11Z,plz seed we need it guys!! :(
,DBZ-Fan,2011-04-03T19:43Z,oh ok i thought it was in only japanese untill i was gonna delete it then i figured out that u can switch audio! ^_^
,Lascovich,2011-04-23T10:47Z,is this the very first dragon ball?
,ATP-Studios,2011-05-12T06:16Z,"This is the real review because people dont know what there talking about. I mean sure the quality is great, but compared to the other Dragonball Remastered set torrents this torrents quality is around a 7/10. But still great to have alternative torrents and rips thanks!"
,Shadow9002,2011-05-22T13:25Z,"Video and audio are nice!
V/A   = 10/9
Screen freeze one or two times at episode."

I can't get more than 20 kB/s !!!
Don't be stingy!!!"
,newonetime,2011-06-14T13:02Z,"I just took a look at the download speed, and it's very high, considering my connection speed, so I wanted to thank those seeding. It was a surprise, considering the ratio of seeders to leechers. There's some very good seeders here! I should have all 32 GiB in two days, on a not so great connection."
,newonetime,2011-06-15T17:41Z,"Took about a day for 32 GiB, damn... Thanks guys! I've got this, DBZ and DBGT, all great quality, and I'm in the process of demuxing, converting the audio, and muxing again, so it'll work on my PS3. I'd make a torrent, but some stupid kid will just download it, thinking he's a genius, and stick it on iOffer, or some other site, and try to make money off of the company's product, just like they're doing with these .mkv files. It annoys me so much...

It's one thing to download and enjoy it yourself, but trying to make money off of it, when you put no work into it? 

Sorry about ranting! Lol. Thanks again! I'll be watching these soon!"
,pandachino,2011-08-22T03:23Z,"@newonetime You're absolutely right! I know how you feel.

Well thanks for this great upload, the Quality is great, I just need to edit them to remove the english audio and some minor tweaks to the video color, so I need to re-encoded them, but I know I can make these episodes twice smaller with the same quality."
,bdreys07,2011-09-10T01:02Z,"I downloaded it. Now how do I watch it in English? Also, I am currently seeding it (it's has a .894 ratio right now)."
,Makkie1337,2011-09-25T03:22Z,"Nice torrent :)

i download it now and its litle slow but its ok.

Thanks mate"
,Nonfire,2011-10-01T20:44Z,is this dual audio if its english it would be suck to watch
,Fingman,2011-11-07T15:43Z,"Please seed guys, so keen for this, thanks to uploader too :)"
,nonukez,2011-11-24T22:41Z,"Perfectly fine torrent, but like others have said, some episodes are out of sync. My luck was worse than DBGT and I happened to download episode 62 as the first one, checked it out, and got pissed. But yeah, rest assured most of these episodes are perfectly fine.

And wtf is wrong with that guy in the comments who said that not having the opening is a BAD thing? Why the fuck would you want to see the opening every time?!"
,cohen14,2012-01-07T03:37Z,Please seed. 
,canesfan3301,2012-02-22T13:42Z,Is there anyway to get the subtitles and/or dubbing if I convert the files to MP4 so I can play it on my PSP?
,noeldiego,2012-02-26T14:18Z,"@canesfan3301 use handbrake

Hi, you saw this torrent? You like dragon ball? GREAT! Download this and KEEP THIS SEEDING, you didn't downloaded it from a server. Seeders are not here for your own pleasure of leeching and not seeding. We need your help to spread this torrent as much as we can.

The episodes are in great quality with an audio option and subs in english. So yeah, it's kinda great and you should show some respect to the uploader.

Download and keep it for at least 1.5 ratio, even if it's only one episode.

Thanks for reading"
,b6f6Lb4u,2012-03-03T15:17Z,"Beside all the corrupted videos I reported last time this torrent also misses the following files :
* [a-s]_dragon_ball_-_000_-_textless_opening__rs2_[bf0637a7].mkv
* [a-s]_dragon_ball_-_154_-_textless_ending__rs2_[435C144F].mkv

The opening is in the FixEps torrent but I only found the ending on eDonkey/Kad. Enjoy and thanks for sharing !"
,noeldiego,2012-03-18T05:51Z,"@b6f6Lb4u I don't have anything missing from my torrent here.

The only problems i got, so far - episode 143 by now, were: the episode 06 with subs out of sync and other episode - which i don't remember now -  with audio out of sync. All the others are perfect."

,imbatman452,2012-05-02T00:19Z,can enyone tell me why the only option is a magnet? id love to download 1 episode first just to check it's OK. the pirate bay is realy getting annoying.
,MinSin,2012-05-07T08:28Z,"Thanks for the download

And all shitheads with crappy internet, shut up, mine was done in 2-3 hours so u suck and stop nagging

@imbatman452
even if its magnet you can choose to downloas a episode as soon as your torrent client is done downloading the file lists, that shold be when you get decent speed

and thanks again ill seed to at least 1"
,Goku2505,2012-05-18T00:14Z,"First off, I can't believe I'm even doing this (actually leaving a comment on a page like this), but reading some of the comments I couldn't help myself... Hopefully, this'll help someone who actually HAS a brain...

As already stated by many others, video is perfect, it couldn't be any better...

As for audio - people don't listen to the fools boasting the english audio is crap and that they won't be watching it in english, they don't know what they're talking about...
The only people who could REALLY ENJOY this in japanese audio ARE japanese themselves (since most of us others don't understand a word). 
I've tried watching it BOTH in Japanese audio and with English subtitles (which are terrible) AND in English audio only and I laughed ten times harder when watching it in English - this is because the subtitles are (I'm guessing) poorly translated Japanese, and they correspond very poorly to the English audio and sometimes not at all, the text is so much richer in spoken English than in the subtitles... And the voices are also great and very, very funny!
I would love to watch this in japanese, but until I eventually learn a bit, this is not an option, since the subtitles are crap and not funny at all... I hope at least one person actually gets what I was trying to say...

For those of you not knowing how to disable/enable the subtitles or change the audio, you have to do it in the program you're watching it in itself (I highly recommend KMPlayer over any other - it's fully compatible with any video format, and easy to use)"
,MrEsteam,2012-06-13T22:58Z,^^^^^So you can't change the Audio permanently ?

,wolfgnag4,2012-08-20T18:10Z,"Thank you so much, best quality I found so far ! 
However episodes all seem to bug and skip the last minute or so (judging by the timeline)... I tried using several mkv players (MPlayer Extended, VLC...) without any change. Did anybody notice that problem ?"
,wolfgnag4,2012-08-20T20:00Z,"Forget what I just said, it's just something weird with the timecode, episodes are complete."
,peppermintpig,2012-08-29T21:17Z,"Great quality, thank you, and for including both audio tracks, legend. I'm having the same issue with the timecode as wolfgang here ... every episode stops with about one minute to go and VLC crashes. Any suggestions on how to fix this??"
