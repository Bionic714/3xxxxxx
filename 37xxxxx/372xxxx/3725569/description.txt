Demons & Wizards Discography
Style: Metal
Official site: www.demons-wizards.com


Demons & Wizards is a project featuring Jon Schaffer of Iced Earth and Hansi KÃ¼rsch of Blind Guardian. Combining the heavy crunch and dark melodies of Iced Earth with the powerful vocals and bombastic choirs of Blind Guardian, Demons & Wizards sounds just like a combination of those two excellent bands, and at the same time, creates something entirely unique.

Jon and Hansi have been both friends and fans of each other's work for many years, and have long wanted to create some music with each other. They've finally managed to squeeze some time out of their busy schedules with their own bands to create two albums together.
