                       Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Afghanistan's three-billion dollar a year opium industry makes it a drug-
dependent economy fueling Taliban warlords and government ministers alike.

But now, largely under the radar, the United States is in the first stages of 
exporting its patented 'war on drugs' strategy from Colombia to Afghanistan.

The new U.S. ambassador in Kabul is the former ambassador to Colombia. He'll 
be overseeing the building of an eight million dollar counter-narcotics 
headquarters. The U.S. has brought Colombian elite drug police to Afghanistan 
to supervise training.

The question is... what impact will the 'war on drugs' approach have in 
Afghanistan? The fate of many lives - Afghan, Canadian, and others - is at 
stake.

A report from Al-Jazeera taking you into the Colombian jungle for a behind the 
scenes look at a U.S. funded counter-narcotics training facility and a visit 
from some special guests.

Avi talks to Andre Hollis, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for 
counternarcotics. He's one of the author's of America's appoach in Colombia, 
and a player in the current plans for Afghanistan.
