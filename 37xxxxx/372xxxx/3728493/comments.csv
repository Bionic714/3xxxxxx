,thesquirrelkiller,2007-07-13T20:41Z,"you go into the folder MagicISO + Crack, then into Crack then double click on ""crack""
sounds good, don't it?

P.S: plz dont piss me off with stupid questions"
,gidgetsucks,2007-07-14T00:58Z,"They're not stupid questions when I did that exact same thing and it didn't work. So I guess the only the thing to do is say ""shit"" out loud."
,hablestop,2007-07-22T23:06Z,"God Damn :) its like the only active one, that won't take a day and a half ta download. TANKS"
,thesquirrelkiller,2007-09-28T17:46Z,"sorry for the delay in answering...
if you've figured out what to do just ignore this, otherwise open up wherever you have downloaded this, go into the folder named ""Crack"", and double-click on MagicISO.exe
you can also replace the original one with this so that you have the full version.

I love you guys! Keep up the good work!"
