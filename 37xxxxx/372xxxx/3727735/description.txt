Title: Tremulous 1.1.0
Description: Fan-made Q3A TC mod.
(That's Quake 3 Arena Total Conversion)


Basically, Alien Team vs. Human Team, each team has a base with structures that can be constructed / deconstructed.  The alien team can "evolve" into newer, more powerful forms.  The human team gets re-enforcements, and can purchase new weapons at their armory (however, sometimes, other incompatible weapons must be sold first.)  I have a good time with this one, as well as Urban Terror 4.0
