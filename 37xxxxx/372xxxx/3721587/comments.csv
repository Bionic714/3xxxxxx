,stevethetyke,2007-06-23T14:46Z,"thanks for trying Babylon. you will probably need to list the artist and song as people wont bother to DL the covers to find out whats o the files. But dont let comments from F--KING MORONS like has been posted previously put you off unfortunatly people like us are not born with the innate gift of computer smarts, we have to learn by our mistakes. dont give up'
Respect...stevethetyke"
