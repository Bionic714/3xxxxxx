:. about .:


The Shield  is a  3rd person  action videogame  capturing the look,
feel and authenticity of one  of the most talked about  programs on
television. Detective Vic Mackey and  the Strike Team define a  new
form of policing  on FX Network's  Emmy and Golden  Globe win- ning             
police  action-drama,  The  Shield.  Sammy  Studios  is  working in             
cooperation with the show's creators and talent to ensure that  the
game authentically recreates the same action and visceral emotional
impact as the show. Never-before-seen gameplay elements will create
a true-to-life police action video game, and moments taken directly
from the series will  immerse players in the  disturbing Farmington
underworld now recognized by millions as Vic's universe. Just  like
the series, players in the  game will delve into the  grayest areas
of the law, employing unconventional police tactics while  fighting
a war on crime where the lines are blurred on what ends can justify
the means.
