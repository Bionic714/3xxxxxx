,hackerxxx,2008-12-30T06:01Z,keygen infected with virus. be careful with it
,studman84,2009-01-07T00:45Z,"Couldn't it be that it's a virusscan ""error""?
Lately I've been downloading things and it said that the keygen was infected, but it was merely that a virusscanner always sees a keygen as an infection (at least that was the discussion that was going on with those files)... 
Did someone try to run this already and was it clean?"

,vikkg,2009-05-20T03:35Z,"ran this on virtual machine, the keygen works,
doesn't seem to be a trojan.
thanks"
