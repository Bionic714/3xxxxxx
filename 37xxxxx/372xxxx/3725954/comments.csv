From wikipedia:
N is an award-winning freeware Adobe Flash computer game developed by Metanet Software. It was inspired in part by Lode Runner, Soldat, and other side-scrolling games, and features a realistic physics engine. The name is derived from ""The Way of the Ninja,"" which is described in the background story. N features a ninja, who is the player-controlled character in the game.
