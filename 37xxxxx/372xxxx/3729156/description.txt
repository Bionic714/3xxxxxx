Collecting issues #1 and #2 of the sold-out slugfest by LOST co-creator Damon Lindelof 
and superstar artist Leinil Francis Yu, Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk Director's Cut has 
a hefty helping of DVD-style extras.

Bonus material includes script pages, sketches, uncolored pencil art, Lindelof's original 
series pitch and a Leinil Yu cover gallery.

Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk has proven to be a commercial and critical success, just like 
Lindelof's monster-hit TV show. The reviews are still rolling in, praising both Lindelof and Yu.

		
"5 out of 5" The pairing of Lindelof and Yu is much more than could be asked for, or expected, 
and Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk stands out. It is an excellent book that I highly recommend," 
says Stephanie Mangold of SilverBulletComics.com.

"Lindelof wowed me with his comic book debut. If his 'day job' ever falls through, he has 
found his calling right here. Artistically, this issue is a joy to behold from cover to cover," 
says ComicFanatic.com.
