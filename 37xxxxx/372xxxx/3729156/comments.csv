,c0ng0bong0,2007-12-27T09:49Z,"I would recommend CDisplay EX http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdisplayex

It's great, and it's free (as in beer) and open source.

It's a great tool, buy the comic, put it away somewhere nice and safe and then download  it and read it there. Keeps things in pristine condition, now if only I knew of some good database program to keep track of the physical collection."

They actually canceled this project due to scripting problems"

J/K...but now to my real question, are you going to put up the ROTF Adaptation comic? And if so, when? No pressure. I just saw it at the end of the Terminator Prequel comic and almost came in my pants!! Thanks HOMEBOY!!!!"
