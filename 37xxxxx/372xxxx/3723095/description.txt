Plot:	A year before Robert De Niro took the wheel, David Chiang cruised the mean streets as Chen Kuang, a taxi driver whose adventures reveal Hong Kong's verve with wit, compassion, and not a small amount of adventure.

Overview:	A year before Robert De Niro took the wheel, David Chiang cruised the mean streets as Chen Kuang, a taxi driver whose adventures reveal Hong Kong's verve with wit, compassion, and not a small amount of adventure (well choreographed by martial-arts great Liu Chia-yung). Variety noted, "The directing and photography show flair, and the script shows thought...The Shaw Brothers are keeping up standards with this humorous, socially aware local production."
