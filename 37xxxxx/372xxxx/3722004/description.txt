Way back in 72 I was in college in my dorm listening to Elton John's Honkey Chateau album when the gut across the hall storm in my room screaming "Get that faggot off your stereo.  Here's some REAL rock from my hometown of Detroit."  He gave me a Bob Seger album and I became an instant fan.

Today, I was cleaning up the iTunes library and thought "Shit.  I used to listen to Bob Seger all the time.  And what great songs they are so I thought I'd share the library in a Mega music torrent.

Included are some more obscure Seger tunes including the studio version of Turn The Page and some others from the rare album "Back In 72"

In the torrent you'll find a PDF with a detailed playlist and a folder of album art.

Enjoy!
