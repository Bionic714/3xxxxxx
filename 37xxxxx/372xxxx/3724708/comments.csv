can you tell me where i can get the english subs from.

thanks"
,newcpitate,2007-08-26T16:13Z,"I have found some english subs...but this movie seems to have an obscure codec?

Does anyone know what codec to get to play this movie? I only get sound,,,,

Thanks!

I'm still seeding this but seems a little pointless if it doesn't play"
,vidursingal,2007-08-26T20:28Z,"same here. i got found the subs aswell. but they are not showing. 
movie is of no use to me either without english subs
help pls !"
,newcpitate,2007-08-27T03:16Z,"hold on...where you able to play the movie? The movie is an avi file but I can't get it to play...only sound.

When searching for subtitles i found the 2cd eng subs pretty easy, but they are for the 2cd set. I eventually found a sing movie file. 

I will find the link.

If anyone knows what codec I need, please help! I installed a codec pack a few months ago and thought I had everything..."
,newcpitate,2007-08-27T03:19Z,"single cd eng subs can be found here:

This is the best possible version I can find. The syncing is off. So if you use VLC player, you can set the delay to -37 and it will sync perfectly. Have a good watch guys."
