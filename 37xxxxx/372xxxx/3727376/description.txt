Honkin' on Bobo is the fourteenth studio album by American hard rock band
Aerosmith, released in 2004 (see 2004 in music). The album includes eleven 
covers and one original track titled "The Grind". The sound reflects Aerosmith's
blues-based influences and showcases a rawer sound (reminiscent of their 1970s
heyday) compared to their recent commercial efforts.

Reaching # 5 on The Billboard 200, Honkin' on Bobo has sold 590,000 units in the
U.S. as of October 2006, having been certified gold.

In keeping with much of the sexual slang and innuendo Steven Tyler incorporates
into his lyrics, the idiom 'honking on bobo' is slang for felatio.
