...Private School (1983)

http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0086143/

Christine (Phoebe Cates), a student at an exclusive all-girls private school, is in love with Jim, who attends an academy for boys nearby. Christine's arch rival Jordan also has her eye on Jim, and she is willing to do whatever she can to steal him away. Jim's uber-slob buddy Bubba is going with Betsy, Christine's cynical friend, though he would probably be unfaithful if any other woman were willing to get near him. Bubba and his pals sneak into the girls' school dressed in drag in hopes of reaching the Promised Land (better known as the women's shower room), while Christine and Jim run away together for the weekend, though their escapade isn't as romantic as they had hoped.

,hyena79,2008-12-16T06:44Z,why would you say its not a fake if nobody has said that about it
,moreisless,2010-03-01T06:14Z,Had my hopes up that this would be 'English' English; made in England. Oh well. If you know of any movies revolving around private schooled English girls I'd be so happy. The movie can be about anything 'knitting' or boring rubbish about anything; just as long as the voices are private English schooled accents(even an audio file would be great); not trailer slut trash whining broad bubblegum US accents pretending to be educated. what is the point in paying for private education if your children come home with a shallow low class accents; what would you be paying for? Nothing. Any help and your expert opinion would be very welcome. So many times I got my hopes up and found cheap crappy yappy squeeky 'turn-off' accents. Thankyou for making this movie available
