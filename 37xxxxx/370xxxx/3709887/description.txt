A train crash. The strange kidnapping of Bill Drake, Father Gilbert?s best friend. Two unrelated events--but are they? In Secrets, the clues are scattered far and wide, over space and time, and putting them together seems impossible. The newly-captured kidnapper certainly isn?t going to admit to anything. And Bill Drake?s heart condition is like a ticking bomb--forcing Father Gilbert to choose between his ruthless instincts as a former detective and his calling as a compassionate priest. Time is running out.
