Could someone please seed some more?!"
,Ender_Swe,2007-06-09T09:52Z,"???

The speed is 500 b/s, all the time?

i´m stuck at 27.4%, But i´m connected to several who is at 90%, but i´m still only downloading at 500 b/s, not over 1 kb/s, it´s irretating.

Is there somethin wrong whit this torent?? or are people stupid and uses some ""uppload speed limeter""?"
,Lethal_Toxic,2007-06-10T15:06Z,"Could someone seed, please?!! I'm stuck at 27,9%! It would be a nice to get whole movie!!"
,FingerLing,2007-06-10T20:46Z,"well, I have not set anu upload limit so..  there must be someone else..."
,wildman69,2007-06-12T20:47Z,To all who download this torrent. You have to BAN all who have an Ip-number starting whit 38 or 208 or you will never get this film.
,sushukka,2007-06-13T07:59Z,SEEDDD!!!!!!!
,FingerLing,2007-06-14T17:02Z,And why should they ban just those people??
,wildman69,2007-06-14T18:08Z,The ip-number i posted belong to the American Antipirecy and they all download very agressiv and do not upload anything and when they have 100% they delete the torrent and start over again. This is wellknown all over the internet. You can use PeerGuardian to stop them you can download it here http://phoenixlabs.org/pg2/. They have killed a lot of torrent this way. I hope a lot of you downloading this read it and do something about it.
,wildman69,2007-06-14T18:12Z,And if you check it you can see that everybody that have over 40.7 % are people whit the ip number i posted. And that's over 100.
,pjornox,2007-06-15T07:27Z,"Seed please, i`m stuck at 42,5%..."
,FingerLing,2007-06-17T16:34Z,so you mean that I should ban them from downloading from me...?
,wildman69,2007-06-17T17:43Z,Yes FingerLing you have to do that. Trust me they only try to fuck it up for people who wants the movie. And everybody that reads this should Ban the Ip i posted in the program the use to download.
,wildman69,2007-06-17T17:48Z,And you can see that the all use Azureus 2.3.06. The use the same computers ( a couple) and create a lot of downloads whit diffrent Ip numbers starting whit 38 or 208
,FingerLing,2007-06-19T02:27Z,"I didn't find any :S 
and sorry I can't seed that much, I'm not sleeping home much at all så can't have the computer on all that time :("
,wildman69,2007-06-19T02:49Z,Strange you didn't find any i have found 123 and banned them. Only today i found 9 new one becouse the keep on creating new one. And the 38 time the film been downloaded i guess is by them.
,jbrad2,2007-06-20T05:38Z,OK. I'm stuck at 42.9 percent. What's up? I never had any seeds but until it stopped I was downloading at an incredible 500kb. I up for any offers of explanation.
,sushukka,2007-06-20T10:43Z,"FingerLing  ban all ip with start 38 an 208.or we aint get this film ever.....
""And you can see that the all use Azureus 2.3.06. The use the same computers ( a couple) and create a lot of downloads whit diffrent Ip numbers starting whit 38 or 208"" "
,wildman69,2007-06-20T16:03Z,I'm also at 42.9% and today i found 30 more with the ip number i posted and the had between 55% to 99%.And so far i banned 162 and if you don't do something about them we will never get the film. FingerLing you must check in your torrentprogram who is downloading and Ban the Ip-number i posted.
,Kjellemann1980,2007-06-21T13:53Z,"Someone please seed. I've been stuck at 42,9 for three days now."
,tiina37,2007-06-21T19:33Z,"Stuck Stuck at 42,9% ... PLEASE tell somebody what should we do to get this film 100% !!!"
,wildman69,2007-06-21T21:26Z,To all of you go back and read what i posted and do what i told you to do or you will never get the film.
,FingerLing,2007-06-23T00:58Z,"I'm not seedig that much 'cause I'm not home much at all. Sorry guys, but if all the lest 39 downloaders could seed it would be great..."
,FingerLing,2007-06-23T01:22Z,ANd How The Fuck are yiou banning people in uTorrent?? >.
,FingerLing,2007-06-23T01:48Z,Never mind the last one..  fuck uTorrent.. Azureus FTW
,wildman69,2007-06-23T01:52Z,I don't have Utorrent i use Azureus and in that program and Bitcomet you Rightclick on the Ip-Numbers and then you can Ban That Ip-Number. I'm going to install Utorrent and check it out.
,wildman69,2007-06-23T01:59Z,I'll be back soon
,FingerLing,2007-06-23T02:13Z,"well, as said.. Fuck uTorrent.. Good downloading speeding, but the rest sucks..  A program for amateurs >."
,wildman69,2007-06-23T02:37Z,Yes you are right you can't Ban Ip-Numbers in Utorrent But for some funny reason you can take away the Ban if you rightclick on the file you are downloading and go to advanced. I have used 5 different torrentprogram and i could Ban Ip-Numbers in all of them Right now i'm using Azureus 2.5.04 witch is a very good program. So if you can change program do that or use PeerGuardian to stop them you can download it here http://phoenixlabs.org/pg2/. But Azureus would be better you can Ban them Forever in that program. Some other program only Ban them for 24 Hour then the are back. But thanks for trying.
,wildman69,2007-06-23T02:59Z,But now it's 3 at night here in Sweden so i have to go to bed but i'll be back tomorrow
,sushukka,2007-06-27T09:12Z,how many time we need to say this......SEED!!!!
,FingerLing,2007-06-27T16:49Z,I have written that I can't seed that much 'cause I'm not at home much and can therefore not have the computer on.
,wildman69,2007-06-27T17:50Z,"Well i got it now i've uploaded 119 Gb so far and i'll seed the hell out of it for a couple of days and make sure only the right people get it from me. And again to all who download this film BAN everybody whit the Ip-number starting whit 38 and 208 it,s the American Antipirecy who is trying to stop you from getting it."
,FingerLing,2007-06-27T18:31Z,"great man.. Hope you are enjoying it.. It should be pretty good :)  
I hope you all seed after you, plz"
,wildman69,2007-06-27T19:51Z,I just checked it out the quality is very good so thank you. And now you can see when the real downloader get the film they seed it's 164 seeding right now.
,shimanski,2007-06-27T23:36Z,"thx.video quality OK, but audio only 2.0"
