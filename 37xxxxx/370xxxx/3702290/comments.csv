[T],exit-reality,2007-06-01T04:37Z,"Single Layer DVD's are 4.7 gigs. 

Dual Layer (double layer) DVD's are 8.5 or DVD-9

All DVD home videos over 60mins are on DVD-9 format.

You can burn this ISO to a DVD+R DL disk and play on any DVD or HD-DVD player. 

This is a full 720x480 resolution film mastered at a sample rate of 8000khz. This is proffessional DVD authoring, an exact replica of what you buy/rent."
