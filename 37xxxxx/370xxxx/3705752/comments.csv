,lazyink,2007-06-04T22:24Z,DementedApe: is this a cam or scr ?
,gomisensei,2007-06-05T01:04Z,"From Torrent Comment: This .avi file is from a pirated POTC 3 DVD.  Good Quality, enjoy!"
,pimpwiththis,2007-06-05T01:14Z,"This is fake,,, demented, go suck on your moms dick bitch!"

,pioneer1492,2007-06-05T17:50Z,gomisensei : This is not a pirated dvd. DVD usually means a good quality dvd rip. This a poor quality cam.
,DementedApe,2007-06-05T22:00Z,"pimp with this: GO FUCK YOURSELF.

pioneer 1492: OF COURSE IT'S NOT AMAZING QUALITY! THE FLIPPING FILM CAME OUT A FEW DAYS AGO, THIS IS A PIRATED DVD, A CAM JOB.  IF YOU WANT GOOD QUALITY, GO SEE IT IN THE CINEMA, THAT'S WHAT I DID, OR ARE YOU TOO POOR?

This is NOT a fake, I have the DVD at my house and the .avi file on my desktop."
,Dirty50ck5,2007-06-07T13:21Z,"gomisensei, while this was taken from something in DVD format, it's misleading to comment that something is from a ""DVD"", pirated or not, if it isn't of commercial DVD or DVD Screener quality."

,Tinkersparrow,2007-06-10T13:27Z,"great film, am l right in thinking it has Dutch subtitles?"
,Grim-Lock,2007-06-11T11:21Z,"Yeah, I saw that same one that had Dutch subs and I think it was actually a real screener, but who wants to watch one w/ subs? This one has Lemon subs. I'd see this in the theater but first, $20 is way too much $ for a single ticket. I'm poor and can't afford it, I think the actors already make way too much money anyway, while I'm working my a$$ of for $5 an hour at Taco Joint. Second, I'm mentally insane and tend to reenact violent parts of movies the moment after I see them. Third, I have a really bad bladder control problem, I once pissed my pants in a theater while watching Nemo."
,konglenard,2007-06-18T14:14Z,how many sub is it?? is it norwegian or swedish here?
