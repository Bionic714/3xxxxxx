do i have to use some kind of software or what LOL"
,Solid73,2010-01-04T20:23Z,"great game,works perfect on the HDD of the xbox. Thanks for your uploads Titi26"
,Varkrath0,2010-03-07T10:43Z,"to those who ask stupid questions on torrent comments in general; learn to use google

to those specifically who don't know anything about modding (aka, softmoding, custom firmware, exploits, etc); for any console including xbox and 360, you must have a modded dashboard/firmware to allow you to play ISOs OR burned games.  

Assuming you have a modded box; you must copy and/or burn the iso a curtain way.  i dont know, but... AGAIN learn to use google...

sorry for my rant"
,Varkrath0,2010-03-07T10:47Z,"you just need to make the iso a curtain way.
will test..."
,triplej057,2010-06-14T09:20Z,"This game works perfectly on my Soft-Modded USA NTSC Xbox.

OK, it isn't ""perfect"", because the game-play is a little choppy, but that has nothing to do with the ISO itself. I'm sure that it is the limitations of the original Xbox hardware (cpu, memory).

I burned the ISO with ease using ImgBurn, a really cool free burning program.

As for Xbox 360, I think that you have to have a hardware mod chip to play home-burned games.

Thanks Titi26!!!! U Da Man!!"
,triplej057,2010-06-14T09:24Z,"I'll add that you don't need to ""make the ISO a certain way"" with this download. It has already been made for you!!!

Just download, burn it, and play, IF you have a modded Xbox.

Also, I still have the stock HDD in my Xbox, so I play games from the DVD discs; maybe that is why it is a little choppy."
,djnaden,2011-01-02T17:37Z,Could you use cheat codes on this? 
,TommyGun123,2011-02-10T20:50Z,"Works perfectly, thanks."
