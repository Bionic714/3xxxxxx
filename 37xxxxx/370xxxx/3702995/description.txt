Dr. Bombay - Rise and curry album, a loved album by me thats like.. "OMFGLOL" at the first impression.. somehow i find it funny anyhow..
Dr. MacDoo - Under the Kilt, same guy, but with a Scottish style instead of the indish thingy...
rared coz its 2 folders and it will take less space
and a music vid to the "hit" "Dr. MacDoo - Macahula Dance" that came on the cd :P
just unrar one of the .rar files
