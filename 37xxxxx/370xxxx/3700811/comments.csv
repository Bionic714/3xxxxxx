Thanks for the great uploads by the way. Any help on this problem would be greatly appreciated."

encode for xbox you can use megui, but xbox it has limte bits. and you need long time to encode."

,sforester,2007-06-02T21:50Z,"Ok, I was mistaken, I can demux all of your ts files, except for Serenity. DGIndex tells me that it cannot find audio or video data, then tells me to check the PIDs. I can manually set the Audio PID, but when I try to set the Video PID it says that it does not contain a video header. The files play fine, both audio and video, I just cant demux them. Any ideas what the problem is?"
[T],HDTV CHINA,2007-06-03T00:50Z,DGIndex not support for vc-1 and dd+.
,sforester,2007-06-03T06:09Z,"Oh, well that makes me feel better. So what would be the best way to convert those files?"
[T],HDTV CHINA,2007-06-03T12:41Z,Use Canopus ProCoder 2.04.02 vc-1 to mpeg2
