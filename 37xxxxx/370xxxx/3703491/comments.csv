,lodger111,2008-01-06T15:53Z,"Bruno1979, what are you talking about, moron? Learn to speak English if you're going to try making a comment in it.

nunchakux2, great torrent.  Thank you."
,noiseboyblues,2008-02-03T16:05Z,"over 4 gig of orbital? woo i'm gonna go mad! thanks nunchakux2. hey, orbital did a 'back to mine' style album for 'mixmag' magazine (U.K.) a while back... anyone got that on a torrent? my copy is several thousand miles away..."
,zeinabqureshi,2008-03-16T20:14Z,"I'll say this is one of the best homage anyone could pay to a band (especially so since Oribtal never were very big--I'm not talking about the big fans). Their music is laid-back, not so flashy (eg, Prodigy), not formula music (Chemical Bros. - they made three or four genuinely good tracks and just rotted), it's something anyone could tuck into and enjoy... and stylish videos. 
This act wasn't just about the music, tho'

Only wish someone would do this kind of work on Leftfield... waiting, wishing... "
,stevieb,2008-05-12T11:54Z,"Nice upload !!

Thanx :D

Keep Lucky !!"
,d-pad,2008-07-25T16:05Z,"not the complete discography at all, missing numerous tracks and remixes (Chime JZJ mixes, alternate tracks from US cd release of first album and the bonus tracks from the vinyl and cassette releases of the first album, original version of PETROL from the playstation Wipeout game... to name but a few)
...but a great torrent none the less :)"
,kingteeb,2008-09-06T21:31Z,"Please seed if possible :) 

Thanks in advance."
,allsoppy5,2008-12-13T00:31Z,You say that Orbital will not make any more music... How do you explain the album coming out in 2009 then? haha thanks for torrent!
,bunzl72,2009-02-13T23:43Z,allsoppy look at the date the torrent was made before you make a comment like that!! orbital didnt announce they were making a new album in 2007 you fuckin dickweed!!! thanks for the upload nunchakux2 quality torrent!!!
,piratailin,2009-04-06T00:29Z,"This is a really exhaustive torrent and I appreciate the work that went into compiling it. That said, these mp3s are tagged very poorly. Nobody wants to spend a couple hours putting tags on this many mp3s. Thank you for putting this out there, but if you're going to bother making a torrent to share with everyone, go the extra step and make sure everything is tagged well."
,trippalhealicks,2009-10-17T03:52Z,"This is an amazing torrent for simply one of the greatest names in electronic music.  Very nice.  I had all but a few of these tracks already, but downloaded it again just to have it all in one spot.  I'll be seeding at a very fast upload rate for quite a few days."
,partchimp,2009-10-31T00:18Z,"Thank you nunchakux2, this will complete my collection nicely"

,babybluetits24,2012-01-08T03:37Z,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_discography so we still need orbital 20 album from 2009
,eterna111,2012-01-21T03:18Z,"Be warned - ALL of the albums and many of the singles are in 160 kbps, which means very poor quality. So if you care about audio quality, try to find these in vbr or 320, and don't download this torrent."
,john_doe123,2012-08-11T01:17Z,"thanks a bunch nunchakux2 and seeders, been looking all around for the octane soundtrack and here it is, awesome! 
therefore only downloaded this album but its in 192 kbps and Not in 160 kbps like mentioned above.
and thanks to babybluetits24 for the summary!"
