Evil Dead 1 & 2 Edited together in one, epic splatter film! Gone is the lame beginning of ED2 where Rami recaps the first film with newly shot footage that doesn\'t line the films up! Now The Evil Dead and Dead by Dawn are seemlessly combined into one endless nightmare.

Comming soon, the Evil Dead Trilogy in one 4hr epic (I\'m not kidding!)
