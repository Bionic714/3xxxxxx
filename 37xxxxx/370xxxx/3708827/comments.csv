,420dopeman,2007-06-09T19:38Z,"Softish, 
check mininova, I have an upped RIP of Toca 3. It's not my RIP however, its DOOM's RIP. OK RIP, but just beware the one thing they did, that's total cheese imo, is they ripped all the car sounds as one sound, in other words they all sound the same, other then that a good rip.
greeetz."
,blood_and_bones,2007-06-09T19:41Z,"Just a suggestion, could you upload Indigo Prophecy? "
,Softish__,2007-06-09T21:54Z,"That sux if all teh cars sound the same, the sound of a car is half the thing =( ... guess there willnÂ´t not be a dopeman rip of toca. but thanks anyway dopeman, ur uploads arer awesome ^^"
,PalleB,2007-06-09T22:03Z,"Thanks for sharing, this looks very interesting. Btw, OpenALwEAX.exe is a sound engine, not a physics engine."
,420dopeman,2007-06-09T22:56Z,"After typing 160+ nfo's, an engine an engine to me, no matter... Thanks for the not so important correction however."
,Softish__,2007-06-10T00:00Z,"dopeman, never mind i got reloaded version to work now ^^. for my that love cars and the sound from diffrent engines is a big diffrent... kepp up the good wrok dopeman !"

,420dopeman,2007-06-10T01:05Z,"Well I doubt my odds on finding this, but, If anyone know of a RUSSIAN translator to English, can you please point them my way, to this torrent, as I tend to only read comments of my latest torrents, I am in need of translator to English for an upcoming project.

,JudgeSed,2007-06-10T04:22Z,"@blood_and_bones:

Search for Farhenheit (sp?).  The console version was Indigo Prophecy (as well as the first PC release, I think), but the latest version of the game is Fahrenheit - Director's Cut.  I got it here a few months ago, should still be around and active.  I even think the dopester himself ul'd it."
,JudgeSed,2007-06-10T04:24Z,"nm, there isn't a dopeman version available, but there are several different copies active here on TPB.  Just search for it, you'll find it."
,Zachriel,2007-06-10T11:55Z,"Hey Dopeman when are you releasing Missing?
Really looking forward to it ^^"
,420dopeman,2007-06-10T15:37Z,"hey zachriel, I'm working out a few things, It's probably the most original game I have ever witnessed. It actually sends you on sort of an online eveidence hunt. It even involves your -email address and sends you clues and updates to your inbox.
Creepy and extremely cool, I'm just making sure there are no saftey issues as far using a pirated version to play. Won't be long, and when its here, man its totally nuts.
Never have I seen anything like it. You almost start to believe its real as it shows you actual video clips of screaming, missing peeps and plays the act of being entirely real the whole time. crazy stuff.. "
,kjas,2007-06-10T17:46Z,"""error creating sound system, game will run without sound""  any ideas on how to fix this???"
,420dopeman,2007-06-10T18:01Z,"You must install OpenALwEAX.exe

As stated in nfo."
,kjas,2007-06-11T02:26Z,"yea, I did that (althought it instantly stated ""Installation finished"" which may be irregular). But nonetheless, it doesnt work :("
,kjas,2007-06-11T02:26Z,the sound I mean

,kjas,2007-06-12T01:25Z,"i fixed my problem lol... I had to copy opengl32.dll to the main game folder. For some reason, my installation of opengl doesnt properly apply to my games? Now I'm having the same problem with You Are Empty except I cant fix it.."
,agge1977,2007-06-12T02:01Z,hmmm. you are empty! installed nicely on my pc! so u got problem with your OS. i think!
,kjas,2007-06-13T03:47Z,"this game is really quite awesome... I solved the crime as Bachelor, and went into the theatre but I dont know what to do from here.... and I really want to conclude the game so I can play as devotress, any suggestions?"

,AlexMalkavian,2008-05-04T11:00Z,Thank you. But... Does anyone have original (Russian) version of this game? (Pathologic[eng]=Mor: Utopia[RUS] aka  ???: ??????)
,thewatchmaker,2008-05-23T14:35Z,"hi dopeman, thanks for your torrents. I am having a prob with pathologic. I am getting message - error creating renderer - as mentioned earlier in the thread, any ideas on how to fix? Thanks and keep up the great work."
,seventeenapples,2008-08-08T16:18Z,"I, like many other people here, am having the ""error creating renderer"" problem. 

What sort of graphics cards does everyone on here with this problem have? I'm using a gma intel 945. If we all have the same card, atleast we know where the problem is coming from."
,seventeenapples,2008-08-08T17:40Z,"3d analyze, emulate HW tnl caps, solved my problem."
