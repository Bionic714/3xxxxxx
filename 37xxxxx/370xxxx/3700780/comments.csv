What processor does your laptop have?

If it has a Intel Core 1 or 2 or Pentium made after 2004, or a AMD Athlon/Turion 64 then yes you can run it.

The 64 refers to if you have a 32bit or 64bit cpu. All mainstream Intel and AMD CPUs are now 64bit. For AMD ever since the Athlon 64 3200, and for Intel since the Pentium 4's with EM64T."

,nicholsml,2007-08-17T06:02Z,"Top five reasons why you shouldn't be attempting a operating system installation

5-   you are asking what a .rar file is          


4-   When you insert the DVD into your drive and it doesn't work, you leave a message asking how to boot off of a disk


3-   you are trying to install a 64 bit OS onto a computer with a 32 bit CPU 


2-   You don't know what a device driver is


and the number reason why you shouldn't attempt to install this operating system?

Because you can barely write an excel spreadsheet but you seem to think you know everything about computers, but in reality you are asking some really fucking stupid questions that plainly indicate that you should get that friend of yours who knows a little about computers to do this for you and stop asking retarded questions, learn to walk before you run people!!

The main problem I have with alot of these people is this, some of them are actually extracting the damn ISO, copying it to a DVD, then complaining it won't boot. As if the damn boot sector would remain intact after such a thing, well... it's madness. And anyone that can't tell r43 is part of a .rar spanned archive is just sick... just cuz the damn icons might not be WinRAR's doesn't mean it's suddenly not a RAR file, come on ppl!"

I am so amused by the number of people that post to this site that have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA how torrents work and more importantly how the files that they download work... like simple ISOz and RAR files... !!

I would LOVE to help these people, but i have to say that if you are on sites like this SURELY you have read up on torrents and .rar archives, perhaps even .zip archivez!??! 

Damm... please people if you are wanna-be pirates, please do make sure you know what this is all about and familiarise yourselves with the terminology and commonly-used software before posting ""lame-ass"" comments. 

Believe me, i am the first to admit i was once a Neewb... but i used GOOGLE before posting what _could_ be called ""stupid"" comments on sites such as this. Nothing like a little self-education 
- ADMINS - i hope you realise there is NOTHING bad intended by these comments just a little REALISM!

Please do some research first. People are here to help, by ALL means... but life should NOT be handed to EVERYONE on a silver platter... certainly MY life has/will never be THAT simple!!!

If you need help with stuff, ask, but please don't make comments like you have been in IT for 20 years and don't know HOW the F the files you download work... 

dude, don't criticise the uploaderz because of lack of knowledge on your part!! Get UltraISO or MagicISO and then see if the file you have downloaded has a boot sector... which it probably does... 

Also, it doesn't matter WHAT speed you write the disc at, if it don't have a boot sector, it will NOT boot... quite logical really... which is kinda how most operating systems work eh?

sorri if i've hurt anyones feelings or made them feel somehow inadequate...nothing like that is intended, just a little serious research please people...it's REALLY not hard... GOOGLE!!

I live in the uk and i can assure you that i'm getting speeds of in excess of 150KB/sec for this torrent... perhaps you do not have your router configured for port-forwarding? please post details of how you connect to the internet, what bit torrent client you use, what the model is of your wireless/modem router is and perhaps one of us can help you with your speed problem... also it would be great to know what your ""rated"" speed is for your internet connection...?

I actually signed up ""just"" to tell zerawyob, that I agree with you 110%!

People should first LEARN about things instead of making shut types of comments. It's not difficult, everythnig is on the web, google it or go to Wikipedia for a more structured  info on things. 
For a guy that is working for 20 years in IT, he or she should have known that extracting an ISO with winrar is the same thing inserting a DVD on your drive copyng the contens to a folder on your hard drive and then burning the contents of that folder to a blank DVD. That will be unbootable.

Nobooter, please learn first how computers work, use your 20 year's knowledge to type www.google.com, on a browser, type a search string as ""how to boot from a dvd"". You'll find plenty of information on that

Guys what I mean on my first post is that when in doubt seek, for information, everything is on the web, before posting comments that are meaningful.

Just inform that I'm not downloading this torrent, but if you need help i'll be around.

Good seeding.

The ""new"" DVD needed a firmware upgrade to see this a as boot cd. Never seen that one before. An alternative method was to press pause on the BIOS post screen until the DVD stopped flashing (ie recognised this DVD) and then press enter to continue the bios post. The it would boot from it.

,deejayguy,2008-01-25T19:05Z,"natas77: I'm having the same issue as you, have had this copy installed for quite a while now, probably about 3 months... but just today got the error about the product key.  Seems like the only thing to do is format and start again, Vista's activation system doesn't recognize the product ID since it's OEM (I assume that's the reason), so you couldn't even pay to activate this version if you wanted to."
,kangaroo83,2008-01-26T16:01Z,Can I boot this up on start-up? I need to repair windows via recovery
,Clonx,2008-02-03T12:31Z,"This working anymore?

,UnScRuPuLoUsvAgAbOnD,2008-02-16T05:16Z,Still Working But WARNING :: Windows came out with a Update In Nov/Dec of 2007 that takes this out!
,UnScRuPuLoUsvAgAbOnD,2008-02-16T05:17Z,Make sure when you download updates that you not download security updates past 11/07 and set so not to automaticly update
,UnScRuPuLoUsvAgAbOnD,2008-02-16T05:26Z,"If you ever get the ""27 days to activate Windows"" due to an update or something you can simply insert this DVD again, browse to SOURCES\$OEM$\$$\SETUP\SCRIPTS\ and run the crack over again. It will fully activate Vista over again. I have been running this version for the last 6 months and I have had no problems. So go scam somewhere else..."

peace out"
,SubbeGubben,2008-10-07T19:59Z,"this works 100% i use it now and i have used this since. no errors ore problems whith drivers and sutsh, its 64bit... so all programs does not work perfekt, but 64bit also runs 32bits sofware perfektley and some xp software works. 
vista is better suported now then before the SP1 update. 

if u have 4gb Ram ore more, and u get a memory problem when u Install vista 64,  
U make it install when u place only 1-3gb ram on the motherbord.
u can put in the rest of your ram after u finish the install,
ore its a bios settings problem and u have to change from ""OS/2"" to ""OS2"" in bios.

I have the latest SP1 vista Update, and the WGA thing, does not work at all, and if ppl say crap like virus and new update takes oute the crack, its all false info. 
and yes its wroks perfekley after 30 days. I have used it allmost 2 years now, and it still good and fast as new."
