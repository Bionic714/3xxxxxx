:. about.:

In Lawnmower Racing Mania 2007, high-octane groundskeepers
face serious competition in lighthearted races. Aboard souped-up,
tricked-out, grass-cutting tractors, players compete on 18 themed
tracks against rival characters such as Angelina Mowlie, the Turfinator,
Mr. Mowjangles, and Geronimow. As it turns out, leaning one's body in
the proper way as the lawn tractor goes around corners is key to slicing 
seconds off a best time, but customizing the mower for top performance
is also crucial to continued victory. As odd as it may sound,
the game is based on real-life competitions and is licensed by
 the U.S. Lawn MowerRacing Association (USLMRA).
