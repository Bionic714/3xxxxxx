Synopsis 
This Eastern-Western set in modern-day New York tells of an Arizona sheriff who accompanies his extradited prisoner and then loses him in the concrete canyons of Manhattan. Coogans Bluff uses its structure both for humorous contrast and for developing a geneology of anti-social outcast from the clash between Clint Eastwoods enigmatic, dangerous Westerner and the pimps, crooks, hippies, and cops he meets in the big town. Not surprisingly, this is at once Don Siegels funniest and most violent work. A companion-piece to Madigan in its study of the effects of urbanism on individualism, Coogans Bluff is more relaxed than its predecessor, employing a wide and inventive variety of characters and locales.
