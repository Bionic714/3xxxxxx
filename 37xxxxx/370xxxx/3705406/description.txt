Repack of the first ten releases of the Complete rompack for the Nintendo DS, verified with clrmame using the release-list on: http://releases.pocketheaven.com/

This repack is for all of you folks who don't feel like repacking the roms from zip to 7z with proper naming for yourselves.

This release combined with http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3700715/NDS_verified_rompack_1001-1100_by_joda give you a total of 1100 roms available in my rompacks on TPB.

To those of you who think this release is to massive and ludicrisly big: 1) Download utorrent (www.utorrent.com), 2) Open this torrent with utorrent, 3) From the "Files" tab, select the roms you don't want and pick "Don't download" from the right click menu. Ta dah! Only the roms you want will hog your line and use up your precious bandwidth.

I've from time to time recieved questions in comments and PMs regarding how to get the roms up and running on the NDS. I've thus created a quick-start guide for those who need it on: http://joda.ordkunskap.se/nds.php

Puss och kram!
