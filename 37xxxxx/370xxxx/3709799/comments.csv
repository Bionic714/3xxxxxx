,barkerBrig12,2007-09-20T05:01Z,how do you woke the no-cd crack i put all files in one folder
,lil_Dice,2007-09-23T21:43Z,i though this game came with 3 discs so how can it be in 1 file and also shudnt it be more than 1.27GB ?
[T],ripthejacker420,2007-10-15T22:29Z,sorry it took me song long to answer but i lost my dsl connection and now have dial up. so everything is impossible on the internet. as far as your problems i cant really help you. i had no problems installing and playing except i know you cannot update the game. you must run on version 1.0
[T],ripthejacker420,2007-10-15T22:35Z,"lil dice,

it is 3 disc images. cd key generator. and no-cd crack.  but i uploaded it to you guys as a .rar file. so you must unrar it and then you will see all the other files.  so, mount the 1st image and install. when asked for the 2nd disc, you must mount it in place of the 1st image and click ok. repeat the step for disc 3.  this game works perfect for me."
[T],ripthejacker420,2007-10-15T22:37Z,"barkerBrig12,

in order 4 the crack 2 work you must copy the w40k.exe (located in the crack folder) into the directory in which u installed the game. it will ask you if you want 2 replace the w40k.exe file. click yes. then double click the new w40k.exe"
[T],ripthejacker420,2008-02-05T16:15Z,"everyone, all you need to run this game is included. i had no problems, as is.  i still play this game with no problem! :)"

[T],ripthejacker420,2009-07-22T09:32Z,"crazy_hobo,

there is a cd-key generator included in the download! therefore you have unlimited cd-keys!  guys, i am currently in the process of trying to reseed this torrent. i guess when i updated uTorrent i lost all the torrents i created. so unfortunately i can't even seed ANY of the torrents i uploaded. i really don't understand how this happened but i will try and reseed as many as possible.  the worst problem i have, however, is the 10GB/month bandwidth limit that my stupid ISP gives me. i have received several ""warnings"" from them saying i must reduce my bandwidth usage or upgrade my internet package. my current package is expensive as is and i cannot afford to pay more. this makes it VERY hard for me to seed very large files (such as the games and movies i have uploaded).  i will try and seed as much as i can but i must be cautious. therefore, i need u guys to seed as much as u can (unless of course u also have bandwidth restrictions like i do)   sorry i haven't responded in so long but i have been very busy and have been unable to check EVERY torrent i uploaded."
[T],ripthejacker420,2009-07-27T11:03Z,"guys,
i re-created this torrent but didn't zip it. therefore you can download each separate disc as needed. also i am no longer able to seed this torrent so download the new one since i am currently seeding that. (also there are many more seeders for the new torrent)"
