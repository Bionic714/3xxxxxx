,kelv1969,2008-05-22T01:00Z,who on earth is going to bother downloading 18Gb via bit torrent? isn't a remux just a video that has been re-processed? if so then all that's happened to this video is someone has processed the original dvd video (resolution 720x576) and stretched it to 1920x1080. Why???? the image won't look any crisper or nicer and all the person has achieved is to create a huge video file. Very strange behaviour.
,kelv1969,2008-05-22T01:01Z,look for a 700mb version of this. it will be quicker to download and I bet you won't see a difference in quality between it and this 18Gb version.
,jrc10000,2008-08-16T16:06Z,"Can someone please seed this?  And for the guy talking smack about the 18 gb dl, I dl'd the remux version of Cars at 26 gig, and it is absolutely spectacular.  Maybe you just need a better rig to appreciate hi res video."
,jrc10000,2008-08-19T01:01Z,OK so in 22 weeks I will have this downloaded.  WTF seeds at 1.4k/s? AAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
