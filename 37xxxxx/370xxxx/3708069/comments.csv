,--ninnu1--,2011-01-08T06:24Z,Is this the Finnish-Chinese??
,theftisproperty,2011-03-16T21:13Z,"That's the original dub with Finnish-and-Mandarin dialogue; included subtitles are in Vietnamese. You can find English subtitles from quite a few places; I watched the movie with subs from http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3267665/jade-warrior-en (you have to time-shift these about +6.5 seconds).

Currently there are only three rips of it on TPB (none of the alternate titles from http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416871/releaseinfo#akas return any hits); the other two have burned-in Swedish and Finnish subtitles, respectively."
