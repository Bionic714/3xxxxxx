2. Don't Need a Gun 
3. Flesh For Fantasy 
4. White Wedding 
5. Sweet 16

7. Rebel Yell 
8. Kiss Me Deadly 
9. Eyes Without a Face 
10. Dancing with Myself 
11. Untouchables 
12. Ready Steady Go 
13. Blue Highway 
14. Mony Mony 
15. LA Woman 

The band includes: 
Steve McGrath-bass 
Steve Stevens-guitar 
Greg Ellis-percussion 
Mark Schulman-drums 
Joseph Simon-keyboard 

This intimate performance takes place in a small NY club setting. In between songs, Idol drops details of how some of the songs came to be written, and Idol's charismatic personality comes through as he shares memories with his audience. He's obviously happy to be there and having a rapt audience boosts his performance even more. He's funny, he's entertaining, and his music has stood the test of time. 

This is an older Billy Idol, and some of that is reflected in his memories, but the performance is still an incredible event for fans. Idol alters the lyrics in some of the songs, and the audience loves it--singing, and clapping during old favourites such as White Wedding, Dancing With Myself, and Mony Mony. Idol also talks about his Generation X days and includes songs from that period of his career. For Idol fans, it's wonderful to hear these songs performed again without all the glitzy MTV trappings.
