,hereitcomes,2007-06-05T18:15Z,I am fairly new to this.  Question: I originally seeded with Bit Lord then removed and reseeded with another program.  It was my first time trying Bit Lord and I don't like it.  I assume it will not effect the seeding of the torrent since I used the same tracker.  Is this correct?
