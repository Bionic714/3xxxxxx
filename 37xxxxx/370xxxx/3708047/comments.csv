,MechwarriorPuppies,2008-11-23T11:11Z,This didn't work well for me. The VC was all messed up - gauges working but the panel was reflective and see-through. Other Carenado aircraft that I've downloaded from TPB have worked fine.
,marquesas,2010-02-09T14:41Z,thanks for the download spiders96...
,placemat1212121,2011-08-03T11:44Z,"I agree with MechwarriorPuppies, the panel is transparent and all messed up. Shame, but thanks for the effort."
