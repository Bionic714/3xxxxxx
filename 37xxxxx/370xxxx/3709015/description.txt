BlowUp offers the highest quality image resizing available, better than bicubic interpolation and any other third party solution. BlowUp makes advanced image scaling easy, preserves smooth, crisp edges and lines, and creates four times (1600% area) enlargements from any image without jagged artifacts or halos. In some cases, BlowUp can enlarge up to six times (3600% area) without obvious artifacts.

BlowUp includes advanced features such as photo grain controls, enlargement-specific sharpening, and support for most image modes, including CMYK. BlowUp also supports 16- and 32-bit images and is optimized for multi-core and multi-processor systems. These features make BlowUp perfect for a professional photographer creating gallery prints from digital photos, as well as an amateur photographer creating a poster from a favorite snapshot. Graphic designers can now easily scale Web graphics up to print resolution or rescale everyday images for large format printing and outdoor advertising.
