Really, enlighten us all, what exactly have you done to benefit the scene? I would honestly like to know."
,Churchills Dog,2007-05-30T03:51Z,"BTW, whats with you and this obsession with stuff needing to be non-ripped?

Here's an idea that may have escaped your brilliance.....taking a bloated game and reducing it to its essentials is a GOOD THING. "

,420dopeman,2007-06-02T07:53Z,"justpoo, unfortunatley, Vegas is one of very few games that requires pixel shader 3.0 support of you GFX card. Most likely , actually, I'm not sure any, laptops have vid cards that support this game. Check in to it, if you have shader 3.0 support, It may be an outdated drivers problem,  but most likely the PS 3.0 support problem, just let me know if I can assist to it any further mate after checking your system.

cheers..."
,420dopeman,2007-06-03T02:32Z,"That is strange, maybe try a re-install of DX also, I remember when I  actually ripped the game, my entire system crashing to blue screen upon testing, can't remember exactly to why, but I'm pretty sure it was DX related, even when Dx seems ok, its files can easily get screwed, especailly when you game often. I'm sure you'll figure it, must be a setting or a shuffled file somewhere, 
cheers matey."

,blemishednicely,2007-11-20T11:47Z,"Couple of interesting border skirmishes on the comments section at first, you'd think they'd have nothing left to actually PLAY the game... which looks fucking awesome! Sweet job, Dopeman, I gotta say, this is the first Dopeman game I've run, & it was even the easiest to install outta all my other picks on the Pirate Bay so far--seems 100% complete...funny 'cause in the full game Iron Wrath, they don't give audio briefings, but in Raven Shield (which I assume is expansion) every control member has voice! Bit   
funny, no? Also, I haven't followed the game for a while & some menu's different. Can you no longer change weap's/BDU's/kit's? Lastly anyone have ENGLISH version of Athena(Sword, I think),
it's another part to the game, & is even mentioned in there, but it's not incl.'d...not to criticize Dopeman it's still 100% Certified Cat's Ass, I'd just like to see the other part & Pirate bay seems to only have a Spanish version. No Habla, senor..."

,Gemoney,2008-09-22T00:45Z,"I had to come back and write you a short note DOPEMAN. You changed my way of download forever. I use to just leech, get what I want and go. After downloading a few games from you I realized how important it is to be a peer and seed. It's only fair to share things that was shared to you. To all the Pirate troops out there I do apologize. The shit thats floating around out there is pathetic. The last thing you ever have to worry about with DOPEMAN is downloading some corrupted shit thats a waste of time. So its nice to come to a place and download shit from a trusted name like DOPEMAN. I just signed up so previous thing that I've got from DOPEMAN don't show in my profile. I choose to only download from DOPEMAN. All his shit works. He explains how to run it, provides info and keys, gens, and all other kinds of things to assure your programs will run. 80 percent out of the times you don't even it. Thx Dopeman! Honestly, you taught me a lot. By explaining how to open an run your torrents has taught me quite a bit about dowloading. You the man. Thx again and keep up the great work."

,thesatanboy,2009-02-13T15:13Z,"I got a little problem, all of these expansions to Ravenshield include new weapons in the game. Iron Wrath has 6 new weapons and the graphics work fine with them, the only thing that doesnt work is the sound. Neither of them have soundfiles where they should be and when i made my own (just renamed old ones that i wanted) the game crashed because of the .UAX files i made.

Surely the real game has working sound on these guns?
The weapons are:
M7PDW
Model 17
Type89F
SR25
Mk3AutoSG
UM100

Can someone help me with this?!"

,ABC190,2009-08-22T20:01Z,"I decided to get this because Iron Wrath was released for free, but the .exe that you download from fileplanet ect. does not work in Vista 64bit. 

I legally bought Raven Shield Gold, so I really wanted to try this out since it was free.

The download went fine, and the game works.

But there is an issue as someone else posted.

The new sounds for Iron Wrath do not work. 

None of the new weapons have sounds. 

The characters in the briefings do not have audio either, like it does in my bought copies. 

I am guessing there will be other missing sounds in Iron Wrath as well. 

Would you mind uploading the missing sounds?

I really want to play Iron Wrath, but with much of the new content missing, it will kill the fun. "
