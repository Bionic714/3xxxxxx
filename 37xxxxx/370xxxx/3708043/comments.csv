you'll see me here at most 12 hours/day
so it might take u some time to DL this. 
However, it's worth the wait! 

SEED! :)"
,PungKotlett,2007-06-15T03:29Z,"Ok.. didn't try to install DVD2 until now.. 
I don't know if you other 1.1 users had any problems with it, but I sure had. 

Looked around a bit and found another soundupdater that's supposed to go w. this DVD
at the same place where this DVD comes from.

(Won't mention any site names since I wouldn't want to compete w. the ppl here @ piratebay.) 

Anyhow, I'll have the updater home in a few sec's, then I'll see how it goes.. 
If all goes well, It should be online here tomorrow. (if it works, I'll be writing some neato classicals first ;-)"
,PungKotlett,2007-06-15T03:39Z,"Ok yeah... that worked just great. 
It will be online this afternoon GMT"

,andolatut,2007-09-27T00:15Z,"Detta verkar ju va fantastiskt! Men...
Jag har laddat ner o installerat allt, men programmet hittar inte ljudfilerna. De kom ju som två stora ISO-filer. Ska man dela upp dem med nåt verktyg i småfiler? I så fall vilket verktyg? Hur gör man annars? Det funkar varken när jag kör det i Nuendo som vsti eller som stand alone. Snälla hjälp, jag vill så gärna att det ska funka."
,andolatut,2007-09-27T00:20Z,"This seems really great!!! But...
I´ve downloaded and installed everything, but the program doesn´t find the sound files. They came as two big ISO-files. Are you supposed to split them up into smalles files with some tool, and if that is the case, which tool? How do you do otherwise? It doesn´t work neither as a vsti in Nuendo nor as a stand alone. Please help, I really want this to work!!!"
