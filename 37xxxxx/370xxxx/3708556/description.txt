Dutchman Jan Mühren, former UN observer stationed at the Israeli border, 
describes how he witnessed Israel provoked it's neighbors in the run-up 
to the Six-Day War. Mühren says Israel was not the small innocent country 
under existential threat from it's neighbors, as has been written in our 
history books. 'It was the exact opposite.' He describes an incident that
Israel created on the Syrian border. More of these incidents would later
result into full scale war. Israeli war hero Moshe Dayan said in a 
conversation with a journalist Rami Tal, which only got published after
his death, 80% of incidents were provoked by Israel. Israeli historian
Michael Oren confirms Jordan posed no thread and was not looking for war.
