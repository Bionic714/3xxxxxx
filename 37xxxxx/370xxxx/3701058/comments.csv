I almost never buy games.  From those few times, I almost always regret the purchase.  HL2 is worth it.  Gmod is worth it.  These are probably the only two games that I am against pirating."
,Szimen,2007-06-08T21:59Z,".7z..... why can't you just be like normal ppl and use .rar or since it's just one file, .zip? ffs... And how is it possible to have it as a standalone? I wish you still could get GMod 9 for free atleast, sons of b*tches. So much trouble with these things, they don't sell this game in stores nearby, i'm not old enough to own a credit card, and my mom refuses to make online payments..."

,Aryonas,2007-11-04T01:28Z,How do you install this thing? And how do you add downloaded add-on's after it's installed?
,sion36,2007-11-18T02:31Z,I need a seeder...
,sion36,2007-11-18T18:50Z,"Really need a seed, at 96.6%"
,sion36,2007-11-18T19:47Z,"Yeah sorry for commenting 3 times, but its finished and I started installing it, how long does it usually take?"
,sion36,2007-11-18T21:52Z,"Alright yeah it finished and I have no Models, I can't see what I spawn, No guns show up, so what now??"
,Dizztah,2007-12-08T16:26Z,"This is Possible! It works fine, me and my friends played all night yesterday. You can only play with them who got this version and so on!"
,Hellomoto1,2007-12-24T00:52Z,k what programe do u need to run this after its done downloading
,Devils_Minion,2007-12-24T04:16Z,"I think that this is a good torrent because when my steam gets borked and can't play offline, i still can play GMod. Thanks, heres to hoping this works!"
,Devils_Minion,2007-12-24T04:17Z,"Hate to double comment, but the .7z is used because it has a really good compression ratio compared to .rar and .zip, and it's not a big deal anyway if you can handle .rar, because .7z opens in Winrar anyway."
,skettt,2011-05-16T20:27Z,"oh... so no seeders = no download o_O
plz seed, man"
,Peka5000,2012-07-15T12:33Z,I hope this works
