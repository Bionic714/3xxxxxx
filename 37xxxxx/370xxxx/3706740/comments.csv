,jackie6,2007-06-09T21:59Z,"Alltså, jag läser infon...o FATTAR inte!"
,jackie6,2007-06-09T22:00Z,Nån kanske kan göra en ny torrent med inkluderad sub? Jag skulle bli IMPAD! (o tacksam!)
,007craft,2007-06-09T23:32Z,I told you in my description that subs are in a seperate file.  You need to use a program to add those subs to the DVD.  Thats why you see no subs option on the dvd menu.
,solvi8,2007-06-11T16:31Z,Vilket program kan man använda då?
,007craft,2007-06-12T05:18Z,"ok.  A .sup subtitle file is like a bunch of pictures that contain the words.  You need to change that to .srt which is a subtitle file that is like a text document which contains the text and position.

First download this program: http://netti.nic.fi/~vpksoft1/SubToSrt_OCR.htm

This program will convert .Sup - .SRT.  REMEMBER: the subtitles are PAL @ 25 FPS, you need to make them NTSC @ 29.9 FPS.  You can probably do this in the program above be increasing the speed.  This may take some testing to get right.

Once subs are in .srt, you can use many programs to add subtitles to the DVD.  I prefer DVD-Lab-Pro.  Here is a guide on how to do it.  http://forum.videohelp.com/topic219535.html.  With DVD-Lab-Pro you can also adjust Subtitle speed, in case they are running too slow or too fast cause remember, you standard PAL movie is 25FPS while NTSC is 29.9FPS.

Sorry for not including the subs in the DVD already but I authored a long time ago before I knew how to do things properly and I ripped only to .sup which was wrong of me at the time.  And As I dont personally care about subtitles, I never spent the time to add them now that I know how.  If you check my other movie torrent which is PAL - NTSC, Timecop, here http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3709359/Timecop.WS.NTSC.1994 .  You can see I fully integrated the subs."
,solvi8,2007-06-12T11:31Z,Tack så jätte-mycket för hjälpen!!!
,007craft,2007-06-12T19:36Z,your welcome.
,Lissy81_,2007-07-03T14:18Z,"Jag håller med jackie6, kan inte någon lägga upp denna igen med subs inlagt. Min dator hänger sig hela tiden när jag försöker köra SupToSrt. Irriterande.

Would someone please upload the movie with subs included. "
