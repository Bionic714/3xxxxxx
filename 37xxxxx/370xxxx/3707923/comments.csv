Thanks mugwump770, at least you know there's one person that will enjoy this. Got any other jingles or radio stuff?

for a GREAT place to listen to radio air checks. Go to 'reelradio' dot com. for a small donation, $12 a year you can listen to air checks (1 to 1 1/2 hours long). from the 60s to the present. I like the 70s. Its like going back in time and well worth the donation, if you like top 40 radio."
