The Beastie  Boys have made quite a few instrumental albums over the years. My favorites are ""In Sound from Way Out!"" and the ""Root Down"" LP. 

Did you also know that they were once a punk band? Check out the album ""Pollywog Stew"", Kate Schellenbach of the band Luscious Jackson was their drummer back then. (http://www.beastiemania.com/whois/luscious_jackson/)

Check out the Beastie Boys' entry at Discogs: http://www.discogs.com/artist/Beastie+Boys

I'd invite you over to my house to check out my extensive Beastie vinyl (I buy everything on vinyl) collection but you might be a Fed. ;)"
