In Toonstruck, Drew Blanc is an animator and original creator of the Fluffy Fluffy Bun Bun Show, but in reality the many cute talking rabbits that star in the show sicken him. His self-revered creation, Flux Wildly, a wise-talking and sarcastic purple animal, has been denied the chance of starring in his own show. Drew's boss, Sam Schmaltz (played by Ben Stein), sets him the task of coming up with an idea of a new character to star in the Fluffy Fluffy Bun Bun Show by the next morning. The depressed animator nods off before coming up with this new character, suffering from an acute lack of inspiration. Waking up early in the morning by his television coming on, Drew is sucked into the television as it displays the Fluffy Fluffy Bun Bun Show, the cartoon world he created becoming his reality.
