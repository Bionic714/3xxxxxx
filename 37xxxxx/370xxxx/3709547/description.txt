Starsky & Hutch  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335438/


It's 1975, we witness the birth of the partnership of undercover cops Starsky and Hutch. One is uptight and by-the-book, the butt of hazing by other officers; he runs through a dozen partners in two years. The other steals from bookies and hangs out with low-lifes. Bad-guy Reese Feldman is importing an odorless, tasteless cocaine that fools drug-sniffing dogs. One of his murder victims washes up on shore about the time Hutch's informants tell him a big cocaine deal is going down. But, our fearless duo moves too quickly, and they are suspended from the force; the partnership founders amid bad feeling. Can they patch it up, don disguises, and ferret out where the murderer hid the coke?
