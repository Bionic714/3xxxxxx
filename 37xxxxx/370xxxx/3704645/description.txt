

SIRCLE OF SILENCE was fronted by former SACRED CHILD, ACCEPT and BANGALORE CHOIR vocalist David Reece. Guitarist Larry Farkas previously played with the Christian Thrash band VENGEANCE. 'Talk To Myself' and 'Words Get Lost' on the first album were originally songs co-written by HURRICANE's Jay Schellen for UNRULY CHILD's proposed second album. Ex-AUTOGRAPH singer Steve Plunkett features in the co-writing credits to eight of the album's twelve tracks.

During 1995 Reece would contribute guest lead vocals to two tracks on former DARK LORD guitarist ALEX DE ROSSO's eponymous debut album release. Schellen later performed on the 2000 AIR PAVILION album. The drummer hooked up with Prog-AOR veterans ASIA in August 2005.
