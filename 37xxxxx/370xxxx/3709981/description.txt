TRY THIS METHOD:

1 Disconnect internet phisically.
Be sure that HOSTS file in C:WINNTsystem32driversetc has no block to alcohol 
website,which is once a key for versions earlier than v4719.

2 Install RETAIL version.

3 Do not reboot your PC yet.

--------------------------------------------------
BE SURE TO NOT LET ALCOHOL CONNECT TO INTERNET!!!! 
If you miss this condition then it won't work!!!!
--------------------------------------------------

5 Replace file: star_syn_client.dll in alcohol folder 
(usually: C:Program FilesAlcohol SoftAlcohol 120) 
and then run Keymaker.exe

6. Paste serial: 

ALBMPH8MP8YDFB26BBBCDDDY4899QM37C7X4JXX92QR6KC3F6PQ6BM3T8G7T8BCVWY4W2T82R3HJKGHT8DF2GDDT8MP9FX36B6KBCBCBCBCBCBCRT6

or

ALBM3P4TVV96BM3T8M3T8BCDFDFPQXYC3YBV98YQRBBCDDD6B6B9QP4F6CDPQK2896KFGT82R9FBC6B342RDFT88967BC8P23MPJ9BCBCBCBCBCQR6

7. Click Register.

8. Click Activate. (Don`t touch .....- " Patch server check " cause keymaker is 
for v4719 and does not match the new dll size.

9. Block alcohol.exe or the IP address 195.137.236.101 with your firewall;
(in my case using VirusBuster2007 for TCP all ports to IP 195.137.236.101 
with Alcohol.exe)

10. Then you can reboot your PC and connect to internet freely.
