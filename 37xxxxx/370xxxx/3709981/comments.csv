I read something in the Alcohol forums today.  It said that it detects previous versions and can tell if you had a pirate copy.  There is even a warning in the readme file when it installs.

Also, you will have to reboot first if the SPTD installer needs to install.  Otherwise it won't install.  So that note needs to be inserted after item 2 in the installation instructions."
,Sliztzan,2007-06-13T06:55Z,"Well I was wrong.
Somehow it is still checking through the internet and found out my s/n was invalid.

Doesn't work guys! (well it works until it checks your license)"
