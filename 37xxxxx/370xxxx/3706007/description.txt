This torrent contains a bunch of audio recordings of MANU CHAO LIVE!

Manu Chao and Radio Bemba Sound System played a packed LA Sports Arena on June 2, 2007. The sound gets a bit muddy when they rock out but the reggae tunes sound good in the booming hall, and anyone who was there will definitely appreciate the memory. 

The bonus track is called Estos Califas, it's by LA punky reggae jungle crew Fosforo (www.fosforo.net). 

The video file is the trailer for the documentary compilation ¡Gigante: Despierta! / Giant: Awake!, a collective memory of the immigrant rights mobilizations that swept the USA during the spring of 2006. For more info on the film check out http://www.gigantedespierta.org


CAN'T PLAY THE FILES? GET VLC!


The audio tracks are encoded in the free open source codec called ogg vorbis. The video file is in the free open source codec ogg theora. 

If your media player can't play these files, just download the free open source media player VLC: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/

VLC is an amazing tool that will let you play dozens of file formats as well as transcode from one format to another, or even set up your own streams if you want, plus it works on Windows, Mac, and several flavors of Linux, it has a great user interface, and it's free/libre open source software. What more could you want?

Enjoy!
