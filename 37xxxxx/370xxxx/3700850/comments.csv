Seeda ordentligt i början, ni som laddar ner den först, så blir bättre."
,dibrivan,2007-05-30T18:00Z,tackar har du cover?
,Rajje,2007-06-01T01:14Z,"Nää vadå? Korrupt ska den inte vara. Det är den inte hos mig. 

Vad är det som händer när du försöker packa upp? Testat med ett annat program?"
,blojbaken,2007-06-01T08:55Z,"Jag kan inte heller packa upp, det slår stopp direkt. Synd."
,Rajje,2007-06-01T10:40Z,"Det kan inte ha att göra med filnamnet? Det är ett é. Eller med filstorleken? Skivformatet FAT32 klarar högst 4 GB stora filer.
Jag har bara packat filen som vanligt och hos mig går den som sagt utmärkt att öppna. Alla kan ju inte ha samma problem, för då betvivlar jag att 17 pers skulle ha lust att seeda?
Men OK, nästa gång jag laddar upp något så zippar jag inte ..."
,Helge F,2007-06-01T18:03Z,"Jag fick inte det heller att funka,tog sen bort Torskfile´n (för dyr mat för oss pirater)och då startade winraren! Tack för uploadet!"
,beriksso,2007-06-01T18:27Z,"Gjorde detsamma och spelar filmen nu. Tack för UL.
(verkar som om zip-pgm på MacOS lägger in saker som får Windoze motsvarighet att kräkas)"
,pverschu,2007-06-11T10:42Z,"Hello,

As I am a Belgian, I cannot make a lot of the Swedish comments but I see other people also have errors when trying to open the archive. I also think someone states that the FAT32 formatting might be a problem but I have downloaded onto an NTFS formatted disc and it doesn't work for me. Can anyone confirm this is a corrupted file and if so, Rajje can you fix this?

Regards,

Peter"
,Rajje,2007-06-11T18:23Z,"Appearantly, Windows can't handle the ""é"" in the filename. So if you use Windows, you'll have to remove that character to make it possible to open the ZIP-file."
,amytriptilin,2007-08-27T23:38Z,"I recently downloaded this one but the zip file is damaged. The error ia ""unexpected end of archive"". I have tried several zip recovery programs but without success; the file is unrecoverable. I suggest reuploading this as a new torrent containing an image file (ISO), not an archive.

,aodman,2007-09-28T09:03Z,"Tackar så mycket, såg precis ""Du levande"" igår, kan verkligen rekommendera den (även om jag tycker denna är stråt vassare)."
,nahoj09,2007-10-22T22:48Z,"Download fungerade perfekt, men vilket zip-program passar? Jag har försökt med winzip och 7-zip samt bytt namn på filen til sang.zip."
,captaincoffee,2007-10-30T10:46Z,"it was corrupt on my pc as well, i renamed the file to just ""S"" and tried to unpack it, i got the same ""unexpected end of archive"" but i clicked on anyway and it unpacked the entire file anyway despite the fact that you get a this file is corrupt message when you try to unpack, and after that the movie works totally fine with VLC player. it seems that the error message is just to be ignored...im watching the movie now it works fine.

  I don't understand how could it possibly work by ""clicking on anyway"" as I was doing this thing several times without any result and I was using more than 10 archiving apps. Anyway if it really worked for you, please just reupload this as an .iso (image) file."
,captaincoffee,2007-11-01T10:34Z,"here is what i mean with ""click on anyway"". 

when you open the zip file with winrar the file opens but a box also pops up saying ""unexpected end of archive"" you can close that box, by just clicking close. 

then just click extract files when you do that another one of those ""this file is corrupt"" pops up, just leave it, dont touch anything cause winrar will start to unpack the files anyway...thats what i ment with click on anyway...it worked for me. 

ive never uploaded a torrent so i dont know how to do it, but im gonna read a how to do file and upload it if it dosent work for you guys...

i just saw his second movie ""du levande"" last night, really funny...not as good as this one though..."
,amytriptilin,2007-11-01T21:00Z,"Well...Captain, thanks a lot! It worked! :)

I had to download the torrent again, but it doesn't matter anymore. However, there is something wrong with the archive and it's a shame that the single DVDR available is inside an erroneous archive.

Also thanks for the Du levande tip. Didn't know it was already available. Now I've found about the Arthouse release.

Thanks for everything."
,Dersanm,2008-01-10T13:58Z,"The thing is that you also have to have a new version of winrar, I had an old one which didn't work, but when I installed the latest version there was no problem at all! Havenät watched it yet though..."
,rwaters6,2009-01-11T00:26Z,"Takk for ul :)
Jeg fikk også feilmelding korrupte filer.
Trykket ""pakk opp likevel"", og filmen funker.
Bruker siste versjon winrar.
MEGET bra film!"
,cowond2,2010-05-28T22:18Z,Why zip in the first place?
,spinner962,2010-10-13T16:27Z,So fucking typical. Leave before 100% is uploaded. You should be banned! You´ve done this with 8 of your 15 torrents!
