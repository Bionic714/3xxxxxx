Cat Stevens, pop star from England, sent 7 albums in the 1970's to the top 10 with songs such as : "Peace Train", "Wild World", "Father and Son"...etc.

After selling 40 millions records he turned his back on stardom.

In a relentless quest for his true identity he went from christianity to budhism, hinduism,...zen,numerology...etc, to finally settle under the warm shade of Islam.

This is a documentary produced by a mainstream music TV channel about the journey of "Cat Stevens" that led him to become "Yusuf Islam".

"Yusuf Islam" made the headline news not long ago. Indeed, as he was heading with his daughter to Nashville (usa) for a recording session, the plane has been diverted to south asia because of him for "anti-terrorism reasons".
