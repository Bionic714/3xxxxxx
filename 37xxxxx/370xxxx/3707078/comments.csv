,mavman67,2007-06-16T01:40Z,"Anyone who seeks comfort may convert to islam or any other religion. Some people may need something to believie in. A higher power, to give them strenght to suffer the day. But if you've never been in dispair, you'll not know what I'm talking about. But maybe one day you will. If you have a true faith you don't fight at all wether you belive in islam or any other religion.
I'm an atheist but I have understanding for those who believe."

,charleybarley,2008-04-29T09:24Z,"Come now, nothing gets better in the world by calling other people ""evil"" in the most sweeping way. Having lived in a Muslim country for some time I have seen both good and bad sides to it - as with Christianity or any organized religion that has frozen into structures of power and control. Of course, in the best of worlds we sould all cherish reason above religious superstition but that seems a long ways away..."
,rockstar11998,2008-05-09T17:59Z,"bodthedog - aka Korihor, Laman, Lemuel - and charleybarley - I don't think you guys have a clue what you're talking about.  Religion is not a superstition nor has it anything to do with Ignorance, Greed, or Apathy (bodthedog likes to say all religious people have this in common FIGA - yes to the fear part).  Religion is based on historical fact and traditions that have existed since the first man.  If any religion seems corrupted it is either a religion of the Devil or a break off of the one true religion that certain greedy and power seeking men have set up.  God has proved himself over and over again but you are just blinded by your sin and pride.  There are indeed evil men and religions out there.  To say that there isn't denies the existence of good and evil.  Whenever there is good there will always be evil to oppose what is good.  If you take Satan out of the debate of Religion vs no religion then you'll probably lean to the atheist side of things.  People don't want to believe that killing in the name of some God is ever right.  In most cases in history these people indeed weren't killing in the name of God because that can only be done by a prophet of God.  Those crusades and the Spread of Islam were all done by religious leaders deceived by Satan thinking they were doing rightly.

Everyone needs to just ignore bodthedog.  He is some disgruntled old man that has nothing better to do than to upset everyone that has a faith and wants to lead everyone away from the truth - he is an Anti-Christ.  That is why I gave him the title Korihor. He never listens to anyone but thinks he knows everything from reading his anti-religious literature and conspiracy material.  He isn't out to help anyone but he wants everyone to be as miserable as himself.  He relies only hard facts and can't grasp anything spiritual.  Trying to get through to him is like using a toothpick to hammer through a 10 foot thick steel wall. 
I have a few video suggestions for those wanting to learn more of how bad Islam truly is.  Watch ""What the West Needs to Know"", ""Obsession"", ""Israel, Islam, and Armageddon"", ""Undercover Mosque"", ""Lions for Lambs"", ""BBC - Unholy War', and ""CNN - God's Muslim Warriors"".  If you don't get good seeds here try using mininova or emule."
