,ein.grosses.pils,2007-12-29T04:04Z,"It works great!  After downloading, I checked the file with Ad-Aware and AVG Virus checker, looks clean.

Note the file doesn't contain the driver for the CA-53, only for the DKU-5.  You can get it from the Nokia Web site.  Just make sure you install it after following the instructions to install Diego."

,linibean,2009-02-14T04:06Z,"@dusan93 & kmach 23

If you use Win Vista and are getting the the prompt: **failed to install iskernel files** you need to temporarily disable your UAC. Intructions on how to do that: http://www.petri.co.il/disable_uac_in_windows_vista.htm

Disable it, restart your computer, and Diego will install no problem."
