,DoaKao,2007-06-09T14:19Z,"Thanks for upping this one - Though tbh I think it sucks :p The soundeffects are pathetic and the graphics would have been modern for about 5 years ago.
Thanks anyway!"
,Silent1377,2007-06-09T16:02Z,"What the hell... Doesn't work for me, when i have un-rar it i press 'Play Men Of Valor.bat' it doesn't start, or it will, but it just blews up, lol? :D I mean i cannot start it, it wont go to main menu or enything else, maybe it's about my screen resolution? Enywayz, i'm a gonna try to fix it .. :F, enyway, nice torrent i guess?"

,rowborough,2007-06-15T17:45Z,The worst FPS war game ever produced the visuals are great if you like looking at  flora and forna but the character graphics and gamplay are crap  1/10 and thats being very generouse !!
,blueboyannehem,2007-06-16T11:49Z,not the best game ever made.. but worth downloading anyway pS. works great 4 me with Vista
,zomgkittylazerz,2007-06-19T00:10Z,"Surprisingly, this is a pretty good game. At first when I started playing I was thinking of deleting it, but as time went on, it started getting more fun. If you are a big fan on FPS, this is worth downloading. Some parts got EXTREMELY frustrating (note: I played on hard). Towards the end I had to cheat to win, because it got so hard.

Press TAB ingame to bring up the console and type these in:
dinkydau - God mode
madminute - 999 bullets"
,Chrispy2k,2007-06-19T07:23Z,I love you.
,SeaRescue,2007-06-19T13:27Z,"NEED HELP!!!!!!

,dsstress,2007-06-22T00:02Z,I have a saitek controller that this game wont recognize . Do you have to play it with the mouse and keyboard. If so that severely  sucks
,tambayaki,2007-06-22T06:44Z,really  starting to hate my vista os... ]>(
,Boonaki,2007-06-23T18:47Z,"I was wondering why my torrents were only downloading
at 30-40k a sec when they had 2000+ seeds, after a few
hours of research and playing with peer guardian 2, I
found 100's of connections per seconds comming from
two sources. media defender and some other (forget).

I added this to my firewall ACL.

Deny All Protocol ANY 216.73.85.0-216.73.88.255 ANY Any
Deny All Protocol ANY 209.62.175.0-209.62.177.255 ANY Any
Deny All Protocol ANY 38.99.252.0-38.99.253.255 ANY Any
Deny All Protocol ANY 64.93.88.0-64.93.93.255 ANY Any
Deny All Protocol ANY 38.102.233.0-38.102.233.255 ANY Any
Deny All Protocol ANY 64.93.0.0-64.93.255.255 ANY Any

Boom, 400k a sec downloads once again.

As soon as I started peer guardian I noticed the
download speed going up, but it topped out when I
added those to the ACL. 

Beware mediadefender.com"

those nasty vietcong can kill you with one shot, it's really annoying !! even on easy difficulty level.

i know what you will say ... ""you are not good at FPS"" but it's not about that, i find this game annoying.

peace !!"
,red4ever,2007-07-24T10:26Z,oh .. and it's one of the most successful Vietnam games i have ever played. but nevertheless they could have made it a little more easier
,rc71,2007-07-24T15:53Z,"FYI.  This game has some annoying problems.  (Design, not the rip)
It's the stick on the ground and you can't move forward crap.  It is a 3 year old game.  It's still a fun game."
