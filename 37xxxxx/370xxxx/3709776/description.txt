The latest (as of June 09, 2007) patches and associated cracks for FireFly Studio's Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader.

The patches are direct from FireFly, you shouldn't have any trouble installing them provided that you did not crack the games previously (i believe the installer checks the game .exe files)

The cracks are simple. Make a backup copy of "Stronghold.exe" or "Stronghold Crusader.exe" in the games directory, and replace the original from those provided in this torrent.

I have tested these cracks in single-player only, not sure if the GameSpy-enabled Multiplayer mode will function.
