\"Dirty pretty things\" (2002) by Stephen Frears focuses on the usually unseen world of the capital\'s illegal immigrants, the invisible people who keep its economy running smoothly. Chiwetel Ejiofor\'s Nigerian exile Okwe is one such person. By day he drives a minicab; at night he\'s a porter in a hotel that\'s home to some shady goings-on.
