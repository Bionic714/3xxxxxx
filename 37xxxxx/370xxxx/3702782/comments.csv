uhm sure. but I've known since i first started listening to them the R is indeed capped. Look at the album images..  rofl, don't talk unless you know what you're talking about.


To xstacey, Also check you audio drivers.


thanks for the upload. even though its still not downloading -.-."
,Crome8Balla,2008-08-16T10:11Z,"oh yea, don't forget their newest album release http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3776774/Korn_-_Untitled_%5B2007%5D%5BCD_SkidVid_Cov%5D192Kbps

,nemoman666,2008-08-19T05:24Z,"The ""R"" is capped in the name cause most people don't know how to type the ""?"" as seen oh their covers."
,nemoman666,2008-08-19T05:26Z,HAHAHA oh wow. this site deleted the reverse R symbol i typed. okay so maybe thats y everyone's just given up and used a reg cap. =P

,checkle1,2008-12-19T15:31Z,"i think the backwards R is not showing because you probably have your character map set to the wrong font, i cant tell the difference between any normal used fonts, example; times new roman.  there might not even be a backwards R in this font."
,sabretooth1,2009-01-03T01:42Z,"you the man!! uploader!!! thanks!!! BIG time!! 
:)"
,LatinMessiah,2009-01-26T00:36Z,This crap is ripped at 128kbps! YUK!!
,brunofin,2009-01-31T20:42Z,"Thanks! Korn is awesome! But it's missing ""Untitled""."
,DeathCab8,2009-02-08T04:13Z,Great work. D/L avg. 396kb/s. Awesome will seed for a few days.
,gopotato,2009-02-09T13:31Z,"the reason why people complain about the way korn is now is because head left the band a while back,  ever sence then their music hasnt been the same.   thats what happens when a metalhead wants to believe in god, their music goes to shit."
,lostboybinns,2009-02-11T21:04Z,what u on about.....head left the band so how can u blame him for their current sound!
,budman07,2009-02-20T02:55Z,"greatest hits, 2 fucking songs, fuck you and every one who likes you, why fuck up korn????? fuck you"
,eddievengeance,2009-03-18T08:41Z,"well , budman07

looks like someone could do with a bowl of CHILLTHEFUCKOUT"
,eveningsky339,2009-04-28T02:53Z,"will seed, nice fast download, thanks bro

sux that the head left the band tho. i know plenty of metalheads who believe in God. he shouldn't have left

just keep seedin' this shit my brothers"
,Krokodilliscious,2009-05-04T09:04Z,"1st to budman07... :
the reason for only including 2 songs on gr.hits is that the rest is on he different albums. helps d/l-time and required disc space

2ndly about the sound quality, this is their entire discography (-) on 480 Mb... C'mon!!!!, don't bother wasting space on complaining. My recommendation? Download this, super upload an d/l speed... Then Download those favorites in 256, 512 kbps or whatever... For those wondering that's an indicator from the ripping of the song, how much soundinfo per second they've bothered including. More = better and bigger files"
,zoli33,2009-11-05T17:39Z,Best Nu-Metal Band I love them ! Thx for share :)
