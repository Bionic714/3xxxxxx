- Ripped the DVD with MacTheRipper 2.6.6
- Extracted audio from .vob files to MPEG-4 Audio with iPod Video Converter 3.2.10
- Cut tracks with Quicktime 7.1.5 Pro.
- Converted tracks to AAC (.m4a) and added Artwork and info with iTunes 7.1.1
The San Francisco Night Live at the Independent tracks are part of a gapless album.

Enjoy!!"
