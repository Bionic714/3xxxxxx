Just because piratbay is mainly used to share ilegal software, movies and stuff doesn't mean it is ""only"" used for this. Everything that is being uploaded doesn't have to be cracked. It's a great way to get the public to notice some great free programs that exists out there.

If you don't like it, then just move on and find what u like. If we only allowed illegal stuff on pb and other torrentsites, then every goverment in the world would shut us down. Our only protection is that its not ""only"" used for spreading illegal software. Never forget that!"

Are you even aware of the meaning of the word ""pirate"", you dumb ass. And no, this is not why ""every government in the world"" didn't shut TPB down. Go read something before posting stupid comments like this."

torrents are also meant for sharing programs p2p, whether they are free or not.

So all the free linux distro's available here that are also available on their sites should be removed in your opinion ?
