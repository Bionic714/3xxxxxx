,Argent,2007-06-08T08:11Z,"... except for the fact that WWH #1 is *not* out yet. So this is either the preview issue or a lame fake - the size says the latter. Relax, people."
,mrdino2,2007-06-09T09:01Z,Fake. It's some kind of manga. The only Hulk thing in it is the first page (I guess to hide it from those who use a client showing the first picture in the file)
,dingbatty,2007-06-09T09:42Z,Fake.  You are a jackass.
,chavkiller,2007-06-10T12:34Z,"hey tosspot, next time you want to seed something, try taking your head out of your ass first.

total waste of %*&*ing time"
