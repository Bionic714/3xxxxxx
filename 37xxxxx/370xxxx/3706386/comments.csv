Xvid Avi is the way to go, screw the damn MKV container. 
i have an MKV converter and as soon as i get any MKVs i convert them and delete the mkv pieces of shit.
thanks for the download but i wont seed it sorry.
AVI&Xvid For the Win"
,Freaky_Freddy,2010-04-25T23:43Z,"lol, mkv is the future, you can either accept it for its greatness our go to the trouble of converting every mkv file that comes your way. 

Either way
no one is gonna listen to your whines, so instead of acting like a 12 year old, you should just help seed the torrent."
