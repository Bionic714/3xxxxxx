        ä Information

          Lacking the lasting fame and the cult status of
          their contemporaries Trõd, Grõs & Stenar, the
          mainly instrumental group Kebnekaise was just as
          important in creating Swedish folk-rock. In the
          Swedish progressive movement they stood somewhere
          in the middle, between the politically and the
          musically progressive branches, where the first
          mainly played message-based music and the second
          had more in common with international progressive
          rock scene. The band did not take a clear
          political stand, but being less experimental than
          Trõd, Grõs & Stenar and staying further away from
          fusion than Samla Mammas Manna, they reached a
          wide audience. At the end of the '70s, Kebnekaise
          started to play symphonic rock, and quickly lost
          much of their popularity.
          The driving force in Kebnekaise was guitarist
          Kenny HÕkansson. In the '60s, he and drummer Pelle
          Ekman played together in T-Bones and in a band
          that later changed its name to Baby Grand Mother.
          In 1969, HÕkansson, Ekman, and bassist Bengt
          Linnarsson were recruited as the new backing for
          Hammond player Mecki Mark, becoming his Mecki Mark
          Men. In 1971, after a chaotic U.S. tour together
          with Sly and the Family Stone, Mark left and
          guitarist Rolf Scherrer was recruited. The new
          band took the name Kebnekaise after the highest
          mountain in Sweden, and started out as a mainly
          instrumental rock band in the tradition of Hendrix
          and Cream, releasing the debut album Resa Mot
          Okõnt MÕl in 1971. For the second album they
          recruited six new musicians: guitarists GlenngÕrd
          and B÷ckler, percussionist Hassan, harmonica
          player Lindstr÷m, and drummer Netzler. Soon
          bassist G÷ran Lagerberg, who had played with Tages
          in the '60s, also joined the group. If the first
          album had been influenced by blues-rock, the
          harmonies had indeed lacked some blues. On the
          second, self-titled album, Kebnekaise followed
          this less-bluesy path into folk-rock, but very
          Scandinavian folk-rock: melodic and sentimental,
          mostly played in minor keys. And though Kebnekaise
          tried out a number of different styles, this was
          the style that would make them famous.

          In between long tours, the group released their
          third album, Kebnekaise III, showing more jazz
          influences than earlier albums but also more
          African influences, introduced by percussionist
          Bah, an immigrant from Guinea-Bissau. The entire
          fourth album was dedicated to African music, but
          at its release, half of the group had left,
          leaving Kebnekaise as a five-man band. The
          following years this disintegration continued,
          both crew-wise and musically. Elefanten was
          released in 1977, but despite the title pointing
          toward Africa, the album was mainly a jazz-rock
          affair, with clear fusion tendencies. And the folk
          music, both African and Swedish, was almost gone.
          After this, HÕkansson left the band to start a
          solo career, and with him most of the creativity
          seemed to have left as well. Together with drummer
          Pelle Holm and keyboard player Per Lejring, the
          remaining three members released Vi Drar Vidare in
          1978, a symphonic rock album that failed to make
          much impact. The members started to look for other
          jobs and some time around that year, Kebnekaise
          ceased to exist. GlenngÕrd released a few solo
          albums and worked as a session musician, with
          ABBA, for example. Bah formed the band the Happy
          Boys, also including Netzler, but soon moved to
          Finland. ù Lars LovÚn / AMG
