Storyline: In the near future, a revolutionary new psychotherapy treatment called PT has been 
invented. Through a device called the "DC Mini" it is able to act as a "dream detective" to enter into 
people's dreams and explore their unconscious thoughts. Before the government can pass a bill 
authorizing the use of such advanced psychiatric technology, one of the prototypes is stolen, sending 
the research facility into an uproar. In the wrong hands, the potential misuse of the device could be 
devastating, allowing the user to completely annihilate a dreamer's personality while they are asleep. 
Renowned scientist, Dr. Atsuko Chiba, enters the dream world under her exotic alter-ego, code 
name "PAPRIKA," in an attempt to discover who is behind the plot to undermine the new invention.
