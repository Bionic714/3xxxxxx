,wishero,2007-07-09T21:13Z,"I watched this move twice now and I must say its very good. While it have a few plot-holes its very captivating and well made. I don't believe I been so entertained by an anime since I saw Ghost In the Shell a couple years ago. 

This movie is highly recommended for both fans of Anime and people who don't usually watch these kind of movies because they look like ""kiddie stuff"". A hint: the story could very well work for a Hollywood adaptation.

As for the quality of this rip, it is excellent."
