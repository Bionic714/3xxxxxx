Alright, I can't run the patch. When I do, I get an error-message saying ""Old file not found, however...blablabla...""

help"
,wirthith,2007-06-11T20:12Z,"nice, 40 - 60 kb/s through the downloading, totally okej, its not very big anyway

and sam3000, very good job :) i agree to 100% that it is completely useless to have all three versions"
,sam3000,2007-06-12T15:20Z,"Hygmer, which file is it complaining that it can't find?  it's most likely one which should be in your original oblivion installation.  the suggested fix from various forums is to:
1) uninstall oblivion
2) reinstall oblivion
3) reinstall shivering isles
4) then patch.

I've had problems myself in the past and doing this has worked for me.  the problem is usually caused by a mod or patch which was applied to oblivion (before shivering isles install)."
,Benn289,2007-07-07T17:30Z,"so i reinstalled oblivion, and i was just wondering if you could give me more explanation on specificly how to get this to work you may email me at hautsurferx3@yahoo.com
or myspace email me at www.myspace.com/benntoxic [only if you got one.]"
,Benn289,2007-07-07T17:32Z,"is there any specific programs or procedures to get it to work i was getting the same problem hygmer had and i did reinstallit so im still confused, just a nice set of more detailed directions would be nice. :] if you may, plz."
,Benn289,2007-07-07T17:53Z,"alrighty, i uninstalled oblivion completely...then i reinstalled and followed your first direction and it still says    ""Old FileNot Found. No Update Since File Contents Do Not Match."""
,Benn289,2007-07-07T19:30Z,thats only for the patch but how do you get to the shivering isles? i gota test it to see if it worked..
,Henkect,2007-07-09T11:09Z,"Ok i got a question.

I have installed the game bla bla bla, and when i go inside on main Menu it dosnt say shivering isles. and i start in the jail when i start the game?

is it supposed to be so?"

> is it supposed to be so?

yes.  shivering isles is extra content within the same oblivion game (rather than a completely new game).  shortly after playing (you possibly have to leave the dungeon area first) you will get a message saying a mysterious portal has appeared and that you should go and investigate."
,sam3000,2007-07-09T11:37Z,"> alrighty, i uninstalled oblivion completely...then 
> i reinstalled and followed your first direction and it > still says ""Old FileNot Found. No Update Since 
> File Contents Do Not Match.""

you are running an english version of oblivion, aren't you?  if yes, I don't know what's wrong but it's not this torrent per se.  oblivion had more than one version of the english patch which created some problems but shivering isles only has one so as long as your oblivion is an english version, it should work.

I suggest looking at what file is not found (IIRC, you may have to scroll/slide something in the patcher window to reveal the filename) and googling."
,Henkect,2007-07-09T12:03Z,"aah big thanks dude. another question, i installed the knight of the nine, how do i know inside the game if i have it?"
,Henkect,2007-07-09T14:47Z,does someone know how to install Martigens Monster Mod also :P sry for asking so much but im a despret person
,allmightyoz,2007-07-10T08:15Z,"ok so i installed it and it worked, but when i get to the gateway to the shivering isles, theres just a bunch of exclamation marks. wtf? no landmass, just missing object exclamation marks. how do i fix this?"

,sam3000,2007-08-04T18:36Z,"hansen_2605, do you actually have a problem?  there's no issue with applying the patch to a downloaded version as long as you restore the original oblivion.exe if you replaced it with a cracked version."

,Poms,2007-08-17T15:13Z,"I have an 'unofficial' version of Oblivion. It doesn't let me update it. If i try it says first of all that my .ini file or my registry is missing or invalid. Then it says 'old file not found, however, a file of the same name was found. No update done since file contents do not match.' and it aborts. I tried messing around with only the shivering isles, but i cant get that to win either. ANyone have any tips?

Thanks in advance!"
,Poms,2007-08-17T15:21Z,"There is one weird thing though: there are differences in game if i start using the Oblivion.The.Shivering.Isles.v1.2.0416.NoDVD.exe or if i start using the standard oblivion.exe.
The grass in the shivering isles is bugged (though a friend with the same version does not have that problem, so maybe that's just a malfunctioning mod), and certain mods that dont work in the normal oblivion, DO work in this shivering isles. I'm open for suggestions, and would be very grateful :)"
,Poms,2007-08-17T15:43Z,"One more thing :) 
The setup in the DVD_English file prompts to reinstall my oblivion, since it can't find it, even if i place it in the same folder.
Since it's a downloaded version, reinstalling isn't really an option.
Is there maybe some kind of registry fixer for oblivion i'd be able to use?"
,Ieviathan,2007-08-18T05:03Z,You should burn your downloaded games onto a DVD for back up purposes...at least I always do.
,Poms,2007-08-18T21:51Z,"Usually i do, but i leeched this game from a friends pc, and he got it from someone else and so on. So no back-up :)"

,didgy,2007-09-16T21:02Z,whats happens in the knights of the nine?
,opopanax666,2007-10-13T14:09Z,"I noticed some people get confused with the installation, so here's my two cents:

1. You need Oblivion already installed;
2. a) If you didn't mod Oblivion, chances are you will be able to use your savegames after installing Shivering Isles (SI);
2. b) If you did mod Oblivion, chances are your savegames will not work (missing textures aka question marks, mods not compatible with SI, etc.).
3. Oblivion in itself is 'rather' buggy. Nothing extreme, but still... A lot has been done by the modders, so...
4. The modding community for Oblivion is vast! And I mean: VAST! So you'll want to mod your game from the start. It's a pretty steep learning curve getting used to the modding-system, but extremely rewarding. BUT, if you use the cracked .exe, you won't be able to use the OBSE modding-tool (which is quite important). Better would be to use Daemon-tools and the Oblivion mini-iso found on GCW. That way patching will never be a problem, and you can use all the mods available...

Hope this helps..."

,aj2292,2008-07-01T08:02Z,"Hey OblivionGamer49, to install this it would be best to burn the contents of the DVD_ENGLISH folder to a dvd; however if you don't want to do this I'm pretty sure you just need to go DVD_ENGLISH\ and run the setup.exe If I'm wrong about this please correct me, as I have not done this myself, but I believe it should work.

After you have installed, at the main folder you have downloaded to, there should be a file named ShiveringIsles_v1.2.0416English.exe, run this and it will patch your version of Shivering Isles.  

After the patch is complete, open up the Oblivion.The.Shivering.Isles.v1.2.0416.NoDVD.exe.zip and inside should be a .exe file.  Extract this to C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Oblivion.  Once there you will notice the NoDVD.exe as well as the Oblivion.exe.  You need to change the Oblivion.exe file to something like Oblivion_backup.exe, and change the NoDVD file to Oblivion.exe.

Have you went to the oblivion launcher and selected shivering isles in your Data files? You know the pre-launch screen? I forgot to do this as well and worked for me.
 For everyone else, this is how it works..install Shivering isles by selecting ""setup"" in the DVD ENGLISH folder. After installed, use the patch named ""ShiveringIsles_v1.2.0416English""
 Then unzip the crack and rename it to Oblivion and put it in the Oblivion program files to replace the other one."
