Its Ginger Lynn, Annette Haven and Traci Lords. Can't get much better than that, except Annette doesn't appear too much in the movie.

Shot on film, excellent quality"

,morian79,2007-11-06T18:08Z,"Thank you, this is a good movie. However, this version has the sound overdubbed in German. Does anyone by any chance have this with the original sound?"
