Blue Dragon (???????, Bur? Doragon?) is a console role-playing game for the Xbox 360 video game console. It was developed by Mistwalker and Artoon and published by Microsoft Game Studios, based on a design by Final Fantasy series originator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who also supervised development and wrote the scenario. Microsoft hopes this game\'s release will provide a great boost to Xbox 360 sales in Japan, as it will be one of the first traditional Japanese RPGs to come to the Xbox 360 system. They hope to sell over 200,000 copies,[1] breaking their record for sales of an Xbox 360 game in Japan to date. As of May 2007, while the game did not reach its initial sales goal (180,000 units) it is the highest selling Xbox 360 title in the territory.[2] The RPG genre is especially widespread in Japan, and the failure of Microsoft\'s first game console, the Xbox, in Japan is often partially attributed to the system\'s lack of Japanese console RPGs. Along with a quick video shown at E3 2006, Peter Moore promised the game would be out by the end of the year in Japan.[3]
