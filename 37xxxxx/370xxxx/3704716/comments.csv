,gvegas,2007-06-05T19:16Z,"Its not a screener...  Trust me on this one.  I would like to make the file smaller so it can be downloaded faster.

Does anyone have any suggestions?"

,Tinface,2007-06-27T08:01Z,Ya its good...You should have put this into H.265 or at WMV...
,YAZombie,2007-07-20T03:23Z,"WMV? Tinface, I hope you're joking?"
,elyk1212,2007-08-18T07:58Z,"""WMV? Tinface, I hope you're joking?""

Why, what's wrong with that?  He could WMV-HD, which is pretty good quality... and smaller than same resolution equivalents in HDDVD or Blue-Ray format.  You can mash 1080i resolution into quite a small data file.
