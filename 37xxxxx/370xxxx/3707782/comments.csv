,Pojen1,2007-09-17T20:43Z,"I tried 4 doses, none gave any effect :S"
,HooglyBoogly,2007-09-28T05:43Z,"Cool, thanks a bunch"
,aproductof1984,2007-10-23T08:10Z,"when you actually buy the doses from the site, they give you three. example: heroin 1, heroin2, heroin 3. This is because once you use one you can't use the file anymore (unless you're using a cracked version)."
,themostoriginal,2007-10-24T07:46Z,"""Component 'COMDLG32.ICX' or one of its dependencies not correctly registered: a file is missing or invalid""  Please help."

,DownloadMafia,2008-01-14T23:43Z,"Oh holy S***.. this is a amazing program.
I have tryed a lot of doses and all work..
but remember to use a earplugs. and turn of all things that make noices and just focus on the sound..

this is important if you wanna experiece a whole new world. 
and a another thing. Not everyone has the same effect!"
,killguta,2008-01-16T20:06Z,Here is the fix for the COMDLG32.OCX problem :D http://www.ascentive.com/support/new/support_dll.phtml?dllname=COMDLG32.OCX
,guitarist33,2008-02-12T01:09Z,"How many of you have actually been affected by this program? I just tried the cocaine sound and had a few ""dreams,"" but I don't know if that's just because I was tired. What ones do you guys like the most?"
,Pirate-Bean,2008-02-20T07:30Z,"Quote from I-Dosers FAQ site:

""How much can I use my doses after a purchase?""

""Each dose can be played on one computer as many times as you want if you have I-Doser v4.5. Additional computers will require a re-purchase of the dose. Simulation CDs are standard audio CDs, and thus are unlimited, as are the MP3 collections. ""

This means no limitations, and no need for a crack after version 4.5, as far as I read."
,Notcow,2008-02-24T05:24Z,"i love you,really i do.they work fine,but im just not feelin it :("

,alibasho,2008-03-25T13:40Z,"

downloaded from a lot of links including this one but still getting the weird unique (nobody has this problem i suppose)error: when i select any drg file from the folder inside it gives me the error; ""runtime error 13 : Type mismatch"" or 
"" runtime error 9 : subscript out of range""

or sometimes i get ""debug assertion failed!"" error... 

i tried ""associate"" drg files as shown on tutorial...
also tried without.... doesnt work

hmm... any ideas folks?"
,DbLoki,2008-05-16T08:25Z,"I just downloaded this program and gave it a try, unfortunately it didn't seem to have much effect on me.

I tried the marijuana, followed by the LSD, and then the Hand of God.  I figured after the first 2 failed, I would see what made Hand of God worth $200, and was quite disappointed that even it didn't affect me >.<

I'm not saying that it won't work for others, just that it might not work for everyone."
,makinmehot,2008-05-23T22:59Z,they don't work on every1
,jalf09,2008-05-31T16:12Z,"Ah SH!T. Headache... >_< I think, I should Stick with something SOFT.

HEAD ACHE!!! Anyway, thanks for the upload. By the way, the program totally works fine with me."
