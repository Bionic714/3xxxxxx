"
,d1mm1,2007-05-31T14:24Z,Wouldn't it be easier to tell the password to previous version?
,oasen211,2007-05-31T20:36Z,"Why should we download a new torrent?
Give us the password, please

,Stragd_gh2,2007-05-31T20:56Z,The original author must have messed up when he created the first RAR because the password he thought was correct didn't work for anyone.
,Stragd_gh2,2007-06-03T22:12Z,"For anyone thinking about getting this, it is coming down, just slowly since there's still only one seed who's not online 24/7.  But we're up to 91.6% now..."

,Bleed,2007-06-05T07:39Z,"The alternatives about keeping damaged files should be availible before unraring, otherwise update your winrar version, mine is in swedish and it says ""Behåll trasiga filer"" and the multi language version shuold have the same options... check http://codeccorner.com/usenethelp/WinRar.html"
