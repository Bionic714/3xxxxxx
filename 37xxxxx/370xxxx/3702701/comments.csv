p.s. any chance of reseeding the History of Rock & Roll for a bit, everyone's stuck at 97% and that is one really kewl torrent dude."
,mugwump770,2007-10-19T18:37Z,"You're welcome!   Let me know if HRR is still needed.  I think it's well-seeded,  though.

Being I'm on Comcast,  you MUST use Utorrent encryption to get this from me."

I'm trying to get my hands on The Easybeats - Definitive Anthology at a decent bit rate. Do you have this in your collection? They were one of the original proto-punk/pop bands from the '60s.
