,ahoy there ,2007-06-02T15:27Z,Only 2 seeds and every body else on 35%. Let's hope it is genuine.
,HomeUserPT,2007-06-03T15:58Z,"The 2 seeds connected, and uploading at 20k-25k (give or take). I don't see nobody stuck at 35%...in this moment there are already 10 users with 72% and counting... :)

Oh! I almost forgot.... IT IS GENUINE!!!

Keep sharing!!! Thx!"
,ahoy there ,2007-06-03T19:14Z,"Hi HomeUserPT

I'm up there with the rest at 75+%. Thnx

Any idea where the seeds have gone? It is still downloading fine but seems strange that current only 78.4% is available.....but I have noticed that this keeps rising even though there aren't any seeds.

oh yes....and thanks for uploading this. My son is a great fan of Little E's and keeps asking me if it has finished downlaoding yet."
,ahoy there ,2007-06-03T20:59Z,"another open question to anyone reading this torrent. I am using utorrent and lately have noticed that on some of the downloads I always appear to have the the most complete download. 

E.g. If there is a total of 82% available I might be on 80% complete whilst everyone else is on 79.5% or lower. Nevertheless as I continue to download the total available continues to rise despite there apparently being no seeds.

Any ideas any body?"
,HomeUserPT,2007-06-03T22:27Z,"Hi!

Don't worry about the seeds... ""i am both"" of them"" :D in different PC's :)

I've uploaded the torrent in Multitracker mode, so, perhaps that's because the information about the downloaded percentage isn't on time...

,ahoy there ,2007-06-04T06:54Z,"Hi

almost there with the download now. Did a bit of research a came up with the following. 

What is ""normal seeding mode"" and what is ""super-seeding mode""?
Seeding mode is the regular way a client seeds.  A peer who requests a piece from you will get that piece.  Super-seeding mode is slightly different.  In super-seed mode, you will transfer a single piece only once.  This means you will not transfer any piece more than once.  This speeds the   initial  distribution of the torrent, by ensuring that when you have uploaded 100% of your torrent, there will be one full distributed copy among all your peers.  However, please remember that super-seed mode is only useful for the initial distribution.  Afterwards, seeding will be quicker on normal mode. "
,HomeUserPT,2007-06-07T18:33Z,"Hi,

I was using the super-seeding mode (in Âľtorrent is Initial-seeding mode) precisely to all the parts became available in the peers without beeing dependent of the original seeder, so the distribuition between the peers is better.

Obs: There is a problem in the structure of the original DVD, but if you experience problems with the compression, i compressed and tested with clonedvd2 and also with dvd-rebuilder+cce 9 passes, and both worked fine!"
,ahoy there ,2007-06-07T21:05Z,"Hi again

It all worked fine for me striaght away.
thnx

I was a bit surprised though that there were only 3 episodes + game.
Keep up the good work"
,HomeUserPT,2007-06-07T23:41Z,"Hi,

I think, that, originally, was ment to have 5 episodes, because the structure of the DVD has leftovers of it... That's why, with some programs there's an error saying that a file is missing...
Anyway, the DVD was released to sale with only 3 episodes.
But don't worry, i'll share Disney's Little Einsteins: Team up for Adventure with 3 more episodes... :)"
,wilma84,2007-07-11T10:30Z,"Keep on seeding! 48 hours - 51,9% :("
,el.fuego.,2007-09-05T03:48Z,"I've been a torrent user for a while, but haven't run across these .vob files... what are they?  how do i open them?"
,HomeUserPT,2007-09-05T12:11Z,"Hi!
The VOB files are part of the structure of a DVD.
You may use CloneDVD2 (for example) to compress the size to 4.37GB and then burn to a DVD, or burn directly in a Double-Layer"
,Prempt,2008-01-17T09:47Z,"When using CloneDVD2, I am getting the error when trying to write existing data:

invalid BookPartVersion

Some help, please?"
,tuleele,2008-02-10T13:50Z,seed plz
