,lgarotinhol,2007-05-31T04:26Z,"Tips to complete IFR lesson of FS 2004. This lesson is a challenge for the pilots of simulator FS 2004 in the whole world. It is rare to find in forums persons that had completed this lesson. In part, it is because of the tolerances that the examiner imposes during the flight, which some are practically impossible to be fulfilled and consequentially you fail in the test. We relaxed a little some of these tolerances, mainly the ones that are related to the time for radiosÂ´ adjustments. With this changes, getting the certificate became a bit easier, but it is still a good challenge. In the annexed video you can observe in a simulation, the main changes we made and the tips that we are giving during the flight. If you would like to install the modified files, request it to us in the e-mail: garotinho.jfa@gmail.com 

I hope you all like it...
