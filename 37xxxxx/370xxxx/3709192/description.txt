Version 8 of my Animalympics capture, this is the official "Way too much time spent on this project" release. 

Animalympics is a silly animation parodying the 1980 olympic games, where all the participants are replaced with animal characters. This rip contains all the scenes, including the tame, but cut by some channels, club scene.

All the pictures used to make the menus. 
A schlocumentary about the making of the movie. 
An extra piece of furry animation.
