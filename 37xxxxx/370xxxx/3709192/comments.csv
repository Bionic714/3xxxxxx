,griffie,2007-06-28T23:22Z,Going to continue to seed this until late summer.
,Scinerd,2007-09-30T18:32Z,Anyone know how to burn this?
,griffie,2007-10-12T04:41Z,"Open your burning program.
Select a regular data DVD
Pick a label, if you want. ANIDVD or something.
Drag all (or at least the VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS) folders to the root of the new DVD
Burn it.
Play it.

Your burn program may complain about extra/incorrect files/won't meet the DVD standard. Ignore it. If you can't play this DVD because of the EXTRAS folder, you need a new DVD player."
,D2ARK,2007-11-22T01:17Z,"Can someone PLEASE reseed this? I am trying to see if I can get a cleaner version than the one I currently have, but this is stuck on 86%. I would be glad to keep this seeded for a while if someone would be so gracious as to let me finish it... This is one of my favorite movies from when I was a child! :)"
,griffie,2007-11-23T03:24Z,"I have been seeding this for some time now. Try re-downloading the torrent, I don't see anyone connected that has 86% completed."
,griffie,2007-11-23T03:30Z,"There are two versions of this torrent floating around. One has TPB and Demonoid, the other only has Demonoid as a tracker. Since that site is down, you may not be able to connect. Regardless of what is being reported, there are still seeds."
,addore_dds,2007-12-19T07:15Z,I too am stuck at 86.3%.  Is there any way you can please seed for a while?  Thank you very much in advance!
,jonteman12345,2008-01-30T02:00Z,"This was great.. nostalgia at its best

Will seed until no more leechers.. enjoy"
,Wolfshadow6,2008-02-14T08:48Z,"Thanks, but a very slow lone seed.. can you reseed??"
,Chiff,2008-05-09T08:10Z,Please seed! I've been trying to find one in decent quality for a long time!
,yambala,2008-08-15T17:28Z,"Anyone here who knows if this one is of better quality then the other torrent on the site?

If so, I would gladly get this torrent and seed it for a long time to come :)"
,DocNick,2008-08-17T06:18Z,Would LOVE it if someone would start seeding this again.
,yambala,2008-08-21T22:13Z,Seed please?
,Joker444,2008-08-30T02:49Z,Can someone seed this? A dozen or so stuck at 59% for the last week.
