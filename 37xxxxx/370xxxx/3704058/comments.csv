,warezddl.us,2007-06-04T16:41Z,"but if you're going to post something ..
shouldn't it be the latest version ?"
[T],nenoukos,2007-06-04T16:58Z,"I like to post something clean and working , even if this is not the latest version. I don't mean that your suggestion is false but everyone make it on his way . :)"
,shinjukublack,2007-07-19T21:36Z,"Sometimes the newest, shiniest version isn't the best version. In fact, sometimes the newer version of something is less stable than an older one. I'd rather have something that works than something brand new that doesn't."
