Well animated, HUGO THE HIPPO is a charming Hungarian children's film that tells the tale of a small hippo trying to escape death at the hands of angry Africans. The little hippo runs away from his captors after the Africans draft fellow hippos into service to scare off shark attacks. When the shark menace is past, the Africans have no use for the hippos, so they let them starve. Hugo flees and, with the aid of a young African boy, manages to call attention to the slaughter of his species.
