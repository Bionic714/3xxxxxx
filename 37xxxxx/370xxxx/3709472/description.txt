NOTE: After spending HOURS online looking for drivers for my 2 year old JVC GR-DX77U miniDV camcorder... I finally found the original disc.  

This is for everyone else, frustrated with finding JVC drivers out there.  

I am unsure if this will work with other models, but it would stand to reason that since there is NO MENTION of my exact model on the CD cover, it might just work for other cams.  

FEEDBACK PLEASE...
