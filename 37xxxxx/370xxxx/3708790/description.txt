Cronos was a United Kingdom-based thrash metal band, formed around 1988 by original bassist/vocalist Cronos (Conrad Lant) of Black Metal Gods Venom. Cronos quit Venom after disappointing sales of the Calm Before The Storm album, and he took with him Venom's two guitarists, Mike Hickey and James Clare. They operated somewhat sparsely until Venom's reunion in 1995, which naturally signaled the split of the band.

Cronos released two albums, Dancing In The Fire (1990) and Rock 'N' Roll Disease (1991). A third album entitled Triumvirate was planned to be released in 1996, but this was cancelled because of Venom's reunion. Instead, three tracks from this unreleased album was included in the Cronos complilation album Venom which came out in 1995. This complilation also included tracks from the two first albums + re-recorded versions of some classic Venom tracks.     

Musicwise, Cronos had a somewhat more straightahead metal sound when compared to Venom, and to a certain extent it was also a bit more melodic and "experimental". In addition to this, Cronos did actually sing on some of the tracks, and that with a great singing voice too.


Included here are the following three albums:

Dancing In The Fire (1990)  (MP3 192 kbps)
Rock 'N' Roll Disease (1991)  (MP3 128 kbps)
Venom (1995)  (MP3 128 kbps)

Enjoy!
