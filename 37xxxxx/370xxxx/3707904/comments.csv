,virtualanarchy,2012-05-24T18:57Z,"Read this review... ""Installing this ruined my night textures and it took me a day to restore the originals, and remove this from my system. Nowhere near as good as the textures I already have. Perhaps it would improve a low end system without any add-ons. But if you have Ultimate Terrain plus other scenery enhancement packs, you may be shooting youself in the foot adding this one."""
