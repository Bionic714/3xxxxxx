The Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments was a children\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s chemistry book written in the 1960s by Robert Brent and illustrated by Harry Lazarus. Many of the experiments contained in the book are now considered highly dangerous for unsupervised children, and would not appear in a modern children\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s chemistry book. OCLC lists only 126 copies of this book in libraries worldwide. It was said that the experiments and information contained herein were too dangerous for the general public[citation needed].

The book was a source of inspiration to David Hahn, nicknamed \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"the Radioactive Boy Scout\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" by the media, who tried to collect a sample of every chemical element and also tried to build a nuclear reactor, which lead to the involvement of the authorities
