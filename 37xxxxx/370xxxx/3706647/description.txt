This is a portable proxy that was created in china to bypass there blocking systems. I had found it awhile back and me and a lot of friends have found it really nice to use in school. Get on Myspace, FaceBook, Ebay, HERE... ahah 

All you do is put on flashdrive > put in computer run microsoft word.exe (haha) and then up pops a box and then you can minimize it to the system tray when it connects. It's really nice

The reason it is called Microsoftword.exe is because for awhile we left it as the default, come to find out our school used a process searcher to find the origonal name and suspended two girls for being on myspace and having a proxy...

Have fun and please seed o atleaste 2 ratios... this is a smalllll file haha
