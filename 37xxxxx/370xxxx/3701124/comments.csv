Description:
Put prestige, pink slips and cold hard cash on the line. The finish line! Just make sure you get there first. 

The night is yours, the streets are yours and that sucker's ride is going to be yours too, just as soon as the pedals drop and this show hits the road, literally. Just strap in, hold on and don't swallow your tongue, because there's no first and second place here, only winners and losers. Tracks on city streets are lit up with turns indicated by large glowing arrows. Avoid parked cars and other obstacles. Watch out, the hand brake is quite touchy and takes some getting used to, try using regular braking to slow your speed and avoid spinning out around corners. Good luck!"
