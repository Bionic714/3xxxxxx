Dear Friends,

the current upload contains several pages from the .html presentation of Pavel Tsvetkov's 'Desperate Love' book of poems, which can be read in full at www.paveltsvetkov.com

The texts are written in Cyrillic and unless one knows Bulgarian, it is unlikely that he/she will be able to understand the meaning of the words.


The current torrent contains v2.1 of the upload files.
