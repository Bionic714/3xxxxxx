Hope this helps u other guys looking for ArchiCad 11."
,alan_sharer,2007-10-27T14:40Z,"True; Norton 2007 reports a trojan (on setup.exe). But despite this, I installed AC11 with crack and it works fine. I've been designing with cracked AC10 for over a year, no probs."
,captainking,2008-01-09T10:14Z,"is there any way of removing trojan, how does this affect computer and all other stuff on it

many thanks"
,roblespar,2008-02-07T11:31Z,"I've downloaded it, created the CD IS0, Copied everything (except corrupted 'Setup.exe' in the top directory) into a temp folder on the hard drive. Install AC11 as commercial version, install WIBU, run the patch in the installed directory, then re-boot. Works without problems or watermark etc."
,mirius2001,2008-02-28T11:01Z,can't get this to work!help!..can sombody tell me step to step what to do?help!!
,kikkomana,2008-02-28T19:35Z,"Delete (don't download) the Setup.exe file in the top folder, contains trojan

1. Install Setup.exe (from the archicad 11 folder)
2. Choose ArchiCAD 11 Commercial license
3. Typical
4. No, I will restart my computer at a later time.
5. Install WIBUKEY
6. COPY the 2 files from Crack folder Archicad.v11.build.966_Crk.exe and ENGiNE.exe to the installation folder C:\Program Files\Graphisoft\ArchiCAD 11

RUN Archicad.v11.build.966_Crk.exe-> hit Patch

Restart-DONE

Worked for me."
,kikkomana,2008-02-29T20:56Z,"Found out that u don't need the WIBUKEY..

So do this:
Delete (don't download) the Setup.exe file in the top folder, contains trojan

1. Install Setup.exe (from the archicad 11 folder)

2. Choose ArchiCAD 11 Commercial license

3. Typical

4. No, I will restart my computer at a later time.

5. COPY the 2 files Archicad.v11.build.966_Crk.exe and ENGiNE.exe to the installation folder
EG: C:\Program Files\Graphisoft\ArchiCAD 11

6. RUN Archicad.v11.build.966_Crk.exe-> hit Patch"

,Vincku,2008-06-22T09:20Z,"Ok, i got the file.
I have extracted everything but the setup.exe.
I have found the second setup.exe in the archicad11 folder.
Chosed to go commercial.
Let the install finished.
Said no to reboot PC.
Copied the two specified files in the crack.
Then reboot.
Fingers crossed.
I'll come back to say if it worked. "
,Vincku,2008-06-22T09:52Z,"I rebooted, and ran the patch. It works fine so far. 
If the software is good, we'll purchase it. "
