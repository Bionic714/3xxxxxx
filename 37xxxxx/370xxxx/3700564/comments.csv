,llwayneio,2008-02-01T02:19Z,"sub-zero i am very sorry for my sudden doubt in your torrent, i was wrong, after downloading it again i can confirm this does indeed work, the problem was vista and a problem with my sound driver and enabling stereo mix in the control panel (is also a problem with cod4). I also did a scan of my computer with nod32 and it found no virus, so once again i do apologise hopefully you can see why i might have thought that there was, what with the FU sign and everything :p I still don't understand what that was for, care to elaborate?

I am just wondering though how long does the .bat take to install the files?

For those bitching about not being able to play mutiplayer as well piss off; the games bloody pirated so of course you can't play it online. I've never seen so many idiots who obviously know nothing about downloading PC games."
,Ride_The_Spiral,2009-05-17T22:54Z,"Subzero!, nice torrent first off, I can't wait to play it!

I'm having the same problem as Vinnie3(he wrote a comment on this page), when I get to the screen in single player before a level, I hit the attack button and it quits game and returns me back to my desktop.

I'm running Vista, and someone has commented that it works with their Vista, so I'm not thinking it's that. Also I tried running in compatibility mode(XP SPK2) same thing happens.

I've followed all your instructions, so it's gotta be something I'm doing, I'm thinking."

But anyway, i went to clear my tem files and noticed that the space is there(on my comp) that was there before i installed the bat file the first time

Could this be my problem when i get booted to desktop after install?

Like it's not ""really"" installing? 

Help with this would be awesome!!"
,Ride_The_Spiral,2009-06-04T18:39Z,"Damn, i was hoping one of you computer wiz kids might have help out by now, anyway.

I stumbled onto something I thought Id share, I guess this game has troubles with Dual Processors, it will lead to crashing problems before you enter a playable lvl. Thank fully Lucas Arts has a patch for this, but it takes a full install of the game, of course, I started downloading another torrent of SWB II. I've already got the patch, I will comment back atfer I have tryd this"
,regndoft,2009-06-04T20:31Z,"No sound at all?

I know music is ripped, but not even sound when firing? The game is totally mute for me. It didnt complain when injecting/installing. I try different settings in options->sound but nothing...

So, is the game suposed to be totally MUTE? Quite a bad rip of an actiongame in that case..."
