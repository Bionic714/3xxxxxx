1CLICK DVD COPY - PRO? is a fast, easy-to-use, full featured software for copying DVD movies onto DVD discs. The latest version now incorporates CPRx? technology to ensure the highest level of success copying the latest generation of DVD movies.
You now have complete control over the final copy. Use the Copy Presets? or the more advanced features to select what content will be copied and how much compression will be used. With 1CLICK DVD COPY - PRO, you can make a perfect copy with just one click.

CPRx is a unique and innovative solution to copy new DVD movies which contain bad sectors or bad DVD structure. Many popular DVD movies are now created in such a way as to make it difficult for backup software to copy them properly. This can result in errors during the copy process, or bad playback after the copy is completed.

In order to copy a DVD which has been authored using these new schemes, 1CLICK DVD COPY now utilizes state of the art CPRx technology to ensure the highest level of success when making an archival backup. Just as we've become accustomed to relying on anti-virus software to keep us protected against the latest viruses, we must also rely on new updates of CPRx to ensure we can copy the latest DVD releases. With 1CLICK's update notification feature, you can rest assured that you will be notified every time a new version of the software is available.

Changes in 1Click DVD Copy Pro 2.5.1.8 (May 28, 2007) :

Changes:
- Updated burn engine which improves finalization times on some problematic writers.
- Episode DVD detection has also been improved.
- Added license renewal reminder.
- Notification of disabled AutoPlay and ability to reset it from within the program.

Bug fixes:
- Movies like "Apocalypto", in which the main audio language is "unspecified" and is not automatically selected (ie. default language is - English will result in only English audio being selected). The software will now enable unspecified languages if they contain more channels than the default language.
