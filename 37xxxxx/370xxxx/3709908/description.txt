ON THE BLOG - BBC Radio 2


Thursdays, 2330-0000

Six parts (3 May-7 Jun)


Caroline Quentin, Andy Taylor and Simon Greenall star in Radio 2's new comedy series about how computers and the internet are gradually infiltrating every aspect of people's lives.


Both a sitcom and a wicked satire of the internet's many absurdities, On The Blog's 'hero' is Andrew Glasgow, the assiduous keeper of a 'blog'. Part confessional and part performance, blogging has been heralded as the biggest revolution in journalism since the invention of radio but, as Andrew demonstrates, it's really just a jamboree for the kind of people who write round-robins at Christmas and also a massive repository of staircase wit.


Andrew blogs obsessively about his life and loves. In his case, this is a collection of military war-gaming enthusiasts, some tiny painted pewter soldiers, his terrifying Czech mother and the mysterious Mr Demjanjuk.


Caroline Quentin (Men Behaving Badly) gives a virtuoso performance of all the female parts, Simon Greenall (I'm Alan Partridge) stars as supporting male characters, and Andy Taylor (Harry Enfield's Television Programme) plays Andrew Glasgow.


On The Blog was conceived and written by two of the most exciting young writers around ? Kris Dyer and Dave Marks ? otherwise known as double-act Nice Mum. They also make their radio debuts as performers (in the tiny parts no-one else wanted).
