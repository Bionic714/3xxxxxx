This is a personal collection of mine which includes all the various resources a designer or an artist would need varying from Maya 3D shaders to royalty free images.

I made them into seperate zip files so people can selectively download them, and also Zip files may have poor compression, they are the most widely supported of the archive types.

Contents: -

Archive.zip
some maya tutorials and textures
6 royalty free video loops (for use in DVD menus etc.)

Matte Painting
Various high quality (3008x2000) images of buildings and various places

Pose and anatomy
3 nude 360 degree rotatable quicktime files
2 collections of a nude kneeling female and a standing woman (from various perspectives, also high quality)

References
230+ images of various objects and places which can be used as references and/or textures (adequatly named, although poorly organized  :D )

royalty free pix
499 royalty free images neatly organized
plus ArcaMagica Templates which can be used as layouts for packaging designs

Textures
almost 200 images which can be used for texture creation purposes

P.S. Hope you guys enjoy using them and dont forget to seed when you finish downloading  ;)
