All credit goes to Sangeki who released this add-on, together with Graphics X, one day after it was released on usenet. He requested not to share the serials he provided anywhere else but usenet and WoZ. N537JB, or whatever his name is, already shared those serials here, claimed credit for the release, and announced he would post Active Sky X as well. So, here it is, giving ALL credit to Sangeki. Sangeki, if you read this, sorry to see your serials shared here against your will, but at least this way you\'ll get credit for your amazing releases!
