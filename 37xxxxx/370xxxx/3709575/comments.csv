,Frank Forthright,2007-06-09T21:58Z,"Umm, maybe it's just me, but I would think HiFiSim deserves some thanks for this ""release"" as well. lol....hmmmm"
,4X-AXG,2007-06-09T21:59Z,"correct, and this is actually one of the very few payware add-ons out there that is actually worth buying"
,allen_x,2007-06-09T22:02Z,does it work without x graphics ?
,allen_x,2007-06-09T22:05Z,"shame on me, forgot to say thanks, keep it up man."
,chlwotjd,2007-06-09T22:05Z,"Thank you sooo much!

any working on LDS 767 for FSX?

thanks in advance~~"
,4X-AXG,2007-06-09T22:05Z,"no problem, and yes I think so, Graphics X is something like Flight Environment, so they operate independently I believe"
,4X-AXG,2007-06-09T22:06Z,and I'm still working on the 767 ;)
,Sangeki,2007-06-09T22:06Z,"Hehe, no problem 4X.

At least we had it 10 days for us.
About time it hits mainstream. ;-)

@allen_x: Yes it works without X Graphics but I don't recommend not getting it as well!"
,Loc_rus,2007-06-09T22:07Z,"Thanks 4X-AXG, N537JB and Sangeki for uploading Active sky and graphics HERE..."
,Blade213,2007-06-09T22:09Z,"Holy shit, thanks. Ill seed :)
"
,chlwotjd,2007-06-09T22:10Z,"4X-AXG, Big thanks for the working on 767 :)"
,Crodge,2007-06-09T22:10Z,"Agreed, one of the best payware packages for the FS series. Up with Traffic 2005, Ultimate Terrain and FScene. You'd think MS would have learned ""weather simulation"" by now. Sadly not...

Time to install FSX I think. Fantastic release 4A-AXG."
,Frank Forthright,2007-06-09T22:10Z,"Please, N537JB is evil and shall not be mentioned here again."
,N537JB,2007-06-09T22:20Z,"4X, did you even check what serial I provided? I have the one that is on the 'server' (Sangeki and some of you others sure knows what I mean), and that is NOT the same as the one I shared.

But yea Frank, or w/e ur name is, I wont share here again for a long time, thanks all you great sharers here, and good bye for a long time.. People like you just keeps  "
,N537JB,2007-06-09T22:20Z,"complaining, complaining and complaining instead of thanking!"
,4X-AXG,2007-06-09T22:34Z,"I'm complaining instead of thanking? this entire share/post is dedicated to thanking Sangeki!

your shares here ARE appreciated; and sharing others peoples shares here is fine as well, we all share eachothers stuff, but actually saying YOU are the ripper and YOU are the supplier is plain bullshit and just getting credit for something Sangeki should get credit for"
,4X-AXG,2007-06-09T22:35Z,haha and no my name is not Frank :D
,Sangeki,2007-06-09T22:37Z,"He meant Frank Forthright, 5 posts up."
,N537JB,2007-06-09T22:38Z,"4X, I dont' own a usenet account, and neither am I a VIP donor @ WoS, so I could never have gotten it from there, you see, I have sources, which I doubt that you have, the only sources you have is usenet, and no your name is NOT Frank, your name is Ruud Pel."
,Frank Forthright,2007-06-09T22:40Z,"lol I think he's talking about me.
Hey, look, I'm just being Frank Forthright here, ok? I don't have anything against anybody here, especially not N90120JB or whatever his name is. I'm just sayin' is all."
,shmuckhead,2007-06-09T22:46Z,Another big fat thank you!
,4X-AXG,2007-06-09T22:47Z,"oh shit, you have sources! I'm screwed now..lol

oh and yes my name is indeed Ruud, that's no secret..nice to meet you"
,Frank Forthright,2007-06-09T22:50Z,STOP FUCKING FIGHTING!!! FUCK!
,N537JB,2007-06-09T22:53Z,"Oh, I forgot your second 'source' are also the ppl that gives the cops a huge chance of getting you, nice nice!

Nice to meet me? For you, yes."
,Blade213,2007-06-09T22:55Z,"lolz, stop teh fighting. What the fuck is WoS anyway?"
,4X-AXG,2007-06-09T22:56Z,haha die polizei!! sehr gut :D
,Sangeki,2007-06-09T22:58Z," ...nicht die auch noch.... ;-)

Are we done now everyone?
Was fun for 5 minutes though."
,Loc_rus,2007-06-09T22:58Z,4X-AXG will you upload 767 here? Or it will be avialable only on usenet??
,Sangeki,2007-06-09T23:00Z,Don't worry.. if he get's the 767 ready I'll steal his release and post it here.
,N537JB,2007-06-09T23:02Z,"Ja, ruud, GefĂ¤ngnis, sehr schĂśn!!!"
,4X-AXG,2007-06-09T23:13Z,"if I get it working, it will be availabe everywhere"
,4X-AXG,2007-06-09T23:32Z,"oh and before I forget, I agree that everybody should grab Graphics X as well..though they are seperate programs and work independently, they are designed to work together resulting in the best quality and performance"

,yeoldecaptain,2007-12-29T07:04Z,"Jedithief,

I learned much the same lesson myself.  Had cracked FS9 FSD products and then legally bought one.  The detected cracks had my windows so jacked up that I literally had to resort to a clean windows reinstall to start over.  I finally just trashed the cracked copies and decided FSD was one I'll never use a cracked copy from again.

Thank the Goddess for partitioning . . . at least that made the windows reinstall easier."
,gheeD,2008-01-20T14:37Z,"GREAT! I love you 4X-AXG! (Not in THAT way...) ByTheWay, i didn't found X Graphics to install/it didn't install it with ASX install. Where to get it?"
,TvrtkoThe1st,2008-03-26T15:24Z,"IT DOES NOT (N-O-T!) WORK IN FSX. 
TESTED ALL-AROUND. IT'S JUST FOR 2004, I GUESS. IT WILL GIVE YOU CRACY LOOKIN SKY.

unless you advise otherwise, but first I need a little seeding help from your loyal followers.

Thanks soo much for the great upload :)> 

BTW, can anyone suggest where I can purchase some used HW (peddles, etc..) to play these little gems more efficently?"
