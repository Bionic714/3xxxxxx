,stickshakerz,2007-06-09T16:27Z,"Hi,

I did try to upload the torrent of final cut studio 2 found on another website in here but there is a error msg telling that piratebay could not find their tracker into the torrent I did send a email to pirate bay to ask explaination but no reply !

so here you are the torrent for an external link ...if someone can post it on piratebay directly ....gogogo....

http://stickshakerz.googlepages.com/Apple_FinalCutStudio_2_COMPLETE.torrent


Think that it is 52 gb to download so it takes a while and the average speed increase with time as more and more people are downloading and share it ....

The more we will be on this torrent the faster it will be to download it.

For the time being the speed is 24 ko/s .....25 days remaining ....

I hope Final cut studio 3 will not be released before I have downloaded the version 2.0 ;)"
,arjanscholl,2007-06-09T19:43Z,Omg 52GB i have to download this to an external drive
,stickshakerz,2007-06-18T13:00Z,"12 gb ......still 40 Gb ....remaining .....    :/

sometimes goes to 40Kb/s

We are more and more to seed it  ;)"

,stickshakerz,2007-07-03T11:28Z,"Hi Lezbo 007,

You said I shuld select the content I want within the torrent.

I could find the content list

I am using transmission

The only option I get while selecting livetype media 1 (right click) is ""reveal in finder""

As you can see here

http://stickshakerz.googlepages.com/Image3.png


Do you think I should use anther bittorrent client that has the ability to select the file I want ?

If so ......Which one ?


Thanks a lot for your help"

,stickshakerz,2007-07-07T12:14Z,"Hi again lezbo007;


Like you, I m using my PC to download torrents too. 

Windows is good at least for One thing ;)

I was wondering if there is any chance to increase the ratio of bitlord ?

For the time being I do upload 10 Kb/s and I recieve 9Kb/s .....When I increas to 20kb/s I get around 19kb/s

Using transmission I could get sometimes 125-200 kb/s but unfortunatly transmission has not the feature I want (disable the download of dmg I have already)

Do you know how to increase the download speed ?


Thanks"
