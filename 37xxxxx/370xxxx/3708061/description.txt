Two CD releases of the original Broadway cast album for this title have caused much confusion among collectors, with the rarer Polydor release (which includes the different murderer and detective tracks) being sought after the most.  This Polydor recording was never made available on cassette or LP, unlike the Varese Sarabande release, which includes two songs not on the Polydor version (the "Moonfall Quartet" and "Ceylon").  "Ceylon" was dropped from the show during its run, and replaced with "A British Subject," which is only available on the Australian cast album.

This is a mix of the Poldyor and Varese Sarabande albums, both of which are out of print and only available (often at a high price) from secondhand vendors.  The track order of the Varese release is preserved, with the addition of the various detective and murderer solutions and a special dialogue track entitled "A Word From Your Chairman" regarding the various endings.
