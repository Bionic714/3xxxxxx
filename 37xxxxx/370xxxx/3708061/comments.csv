Somewhere over the years I lost my original complete CD that we all got as cast members. Yes, I was in the show on Broadway - till closing night! 
Thank you so much!
PS ""Ceylon"" was in the show the entire run on Broadway. The only thing that changed drastically was the Chairman's part after George Rose died (actually murdered). "
