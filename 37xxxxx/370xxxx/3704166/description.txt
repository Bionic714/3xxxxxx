clever hip hop mix from yoda including a diverse range of samples from classic 80\'s films (ferris beuller\'s day off and the goonies) t.v shows (Dallas, Knight Rider) computer games and commercials, as well as some great 80\'s rap and hip hop tracks. Great for when you\'re feeling nostalgic...made me laugh out loud.
