,hex1,2007-07-22T06:55Z,"It's a shame it's one archive, I already have some and have almost reached my limit, can't download this. Next time when releasing a collection please put them as different files."
,tazzy85,2007-07-31T16:00Z,why is it supposed to be 1.37GB yet i've now downloaded 1.38 and only 93.3%?
,strooxstroox,2008-02-06T03:19Z,"For those looking at this package, it is Jim Dale reading.  

Just finished listening to the second book.  Sound quality drops every now and then, but usually goes back to a decent quality by the next file of that book.  

Rarely, you will get long 10-20 second pauses at the end of or the beginning of a new mp3 file.  Only once or twice, a few seconds of text was missed because of a file starting in the middle of a sentence.  

At the third book, the quality gets really bad.  I am downloading the audiobook for HP&tPoA in another torrent, because the files in this package are not worth listening to.  Tried for the first 3 mp3 files to just deal with it, but ended up with sore ears from the strange distortion in background and the S sounds when I turned the volume to a point where I could hear Jim Dale's voice at a regular tone.  

Skipping ahead, the GoF sounds like it has the same distortion, but not as badly as the PoA.  OotF sounds a bit quieter, muffled, even when the volume is turned up, but seems alright.  

HBP sounds amazing.  The audio quality is really good and everything is crisp and loud.  

I guess that's what you get when someone throws together a collection of audiobooks, probably all ripped by different people, using different programs.  I'm still grateful to whoever make this torrent, but you may end up redownloading one or two of the books in here.  "
,rathgar2,2008-09-12T04:25Z,"strooxstroox gives a fair assessment here.  It is what I had and I wanted to share what I could.  Ejoy this one unless you can get it better elsewhere!
