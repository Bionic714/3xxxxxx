Strange and out of print CD soundtrack to "Orgy of the Dead," written and directed by Ed Wood.  The Prince and Princess of Darkness take two young lovers hostage and subject them to strange, exotic topless burlesque numbers before vanishing at the first light of dawn.  A combination of Z-grade horror movie and girlie tease/strip show flick, featuring such memorable bad dialogue as "no one wishes to see a man dance," "torture, torture, it pleasures me," and "a pussycat is born to be whipped."  May not make sense to those who haven't seen (or endured) the movie, but the purple and lurid intonations of Criswell and the pathetic comedy attempts of his underlings the Wolfman and the Mummy are good for a laugh.

This CD features nearly the entire soundtrack of the movie, complete with dialogue and sound effects.  A must have for Ed Wood fans, or people who love cheesy strip music...
