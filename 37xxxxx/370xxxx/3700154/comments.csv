I've only watched ""Bergmann och Fรฅrรถ"" as yet. I think probably a combination of his knowing this would be his last chance to set the record straight, and the fact that Nyrerรถd is rather charming, caused him to open up and tell it warts and all. That story about his baby sister was horrifyingly honest.

RIP, Mr. B. Maybe you should have tried the Sicilian Defence. But Death always seems to prevail in those long endgames."

Subtitles are in SWEDISH NOT ENGLISH :(

Anyone know where to get English subs from pls?"
,DuffPaddy,2008-07-07T23:29Z,"Yes, Chickpea, the *default* subtitles are indeed Swedish. But English (and other languages) are available. How to select them depends on what player you use (check the help), but they are there. I should know, because I've watched them and have virtually no Swedish myself."
