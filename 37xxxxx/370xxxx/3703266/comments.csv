,pimpwiththis,2007-06-02T06:22Z,Well said moracca.....

,purge98,2007-06-07T16:12Z,"You bastard (cabron)...why don't you seed?
I'm stuck on 60.9% and am getting fucking pissed off with your lack of seeding.
Like Toodeloo said. fuck off if you can't seed."
,Toodeloo,2007-06-07T17:52Z,"Hey purge!
Stuck on 60,9%??? U gotta be kidding!!!  Me to. When (if) I am finish downloading this, I will wrap my cock in it and ram it up someones ass!!!"
,purge98,2007-06-07T17:59Z,"Well said. I'll hold him down while you do it!

vmontesino you are biggest piece of shit on piratebay. What the fuck is wrong with you?

Seed or I'll send you the biggest fucking virus there is which will make your eyes explode you donkey cock sucker."
,Toodeloo,2007-06-07T22:37Z,"Looks like we got a deal!
Serious : Its a shame that so many people dont seed. If everyone had a share-ratio on minmum 1,1 everything would be OK. Why cant people understand that. Sometimes I wonder how the hell they manage to turn their computer on......"
