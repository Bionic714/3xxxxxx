An alternative to Regenzy's Spanish PDTV recording of the Eurovision 2007 final.


Advantages:

*Much better quality (recorded HDTV BBC broadcast, but has MPEG encoding I think)

*Includes voting

*Narration in English and less disruptive than the Spanish version


Disadvantages:

*4 times bigger file size (so for the ones who don't need the vid urgently)

*In DVD format of 4 parts (you'll probably need something like Cyberlink PowerDVD   or similar to play it, 'cause it's worse quality if played with Windows Media Player)

Total duration: 32:12:29
    Video size: 720 x 576


V. good recording    ;)
