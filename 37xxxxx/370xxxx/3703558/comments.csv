what swedish version r u reffering to? a swedish DTV rip? and who do u mean is annoying? the uploader? or the narrator at the eurovision? ...i dont get it, but i havent downloaded this yet so perhaps i will soon know what u mean"
,bren_pirate,2008-02-13T00:41Z,the narrator is the annoyance...he seems to find it imposable to simply shut the fuck up.... he makes it almost not worth watching
