,DocWallabee,2007-05-31T00:59Z,"Thanks for the upload! I have downloaded every pack you have put out there! GREAT WORK!!!  Everything works great!!  I recommend M3 DS Simply or Supercard DS1. Both are very easy to use, just un-rar the files and transfer the .nds file to the card!   again.........THANKS!!!!"
,kerasmus,2007-05-31T18:35Z,Hi I have some of your other packs. How can I change the .zip files to .7z? Do I need to upack them and then pack them again with .7z?. Thanks Keras
[T],magumagu,2007-06-01T16:36Z,"@kerasmus
Yes, you are correct; you basically need to unpack and repack every file. For myself, I use a batch-file script to do it for me.
Basically you get 7z.exe from the command-line version of 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org) and grep.exe and sed.exe from the unxutils package (http://unxutils.sourceforge.net). Put those in the root rom-folder of yours and create a batch-file (I named mine 7z-repack.bat). Edit the batch file and put the following in it (Copy/Paste is your friend).
-----------------8output.tmp
for /F ""delims=/"" %%a in (output.tmp) do 7z e ""%%a.zip"" && 7z a -t7z -m0=lzma -mx=9 -mfb=64 -md=32m -ms=on -bd ""%%a.7z"" ""*.nds"" && rm ""%%a.zip"" ""*.nds""
rm output.tmp
-----------------8"
[T],magumagu,2007-06-01T16:40Z,"Crap, the comment broke by using ""less-than"" signs in comment.

Well, the code's supposed be:
@echo off
dir /B /S *.zip |sed ""s/\.zip//"" |grep -v .tmp >output.tmp
for /F ""delims=/"" %%a in (output.tmp) do 7z e ""%%a.zip"" && 7z a -t7z -m0=lzma -mx=9 -mfb=64 -md=32m -ms=on -bd ""%%a.7z"" ""*.nds"" && rm ""%%a.zip"" ""*.nds""
rm output.tmp



Then run that batch file and it will:
1) Scan the sub-folder structure of the current directory for any zip-files.
2) Un-pack the zips, one at a time.
3) Repack the rom from step 2 using 7z, maximum compression.
4) Remove the original zip and the unpacked rom.
5) Repeat for all found rom-zips.

,bitslicker,2007-06-01T17:38Z,"its great to see that you got rid of the zip format and adopted the 7z format. this save a considerable amount of bandwidth for those with slower connections.

@kerasmus, you can convert to the rar format and save about the same about of space as 7z. winrar has a convert feature that integrated into the windows shell. just select all your files and right click and convert."
,whatstone98,2007-06-03T08:58Z,"Ok I'm a noob, but I have one question:

What does the letter in the end of the gamenames mean?
I understand that (J) means japan, but what does the other like (U) and (E) mean?
please give me a list. or a link. "
,dat12,2007-06-03T09:27Z,"whatstone98 

the (U) means US
the (E) means Europe"

,oblachubs,2007-09-01T05:14Z,Any chance someone can seed this?  Much appreciated. 
,zyxomaniac,2007-09-12T01:09Z,"Hepp!

Thanks for excellent uploads and thanks for the repack-script.

One note: remove the """" around ""*.nds"" or the rm won't work causing an increasingly large 7z to be created. At least if the zip-files are all in the same dir.

after editing the scipt should look like this:
@echo off
dir /B /S *.zip |sed ""s/\.zip//"" |grep -v .tmp >output.tmp
for /F ""delims=/"" %%a in (output.tmp) do 7z e ""%%a.zip"" && 7z a -t7z -m0=lzma -mx=9 -mfb=64 -md=32m -ms=on -bd ""%%a.7z"" ""*.nds"" && rm ""%%a.zip"" *.nds
rm output.tmp

peace."

,manjina,2007-11-19T16:06Z,"octo, you need to set the path to 7zip.exe:

@echo off
set sevenZ=""C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe""
dir /B /S *.zip |sed ""s/\.zip//"" |grep -v .tmp >output.tmp
for /F ""delims=/"" %%a in (output.tmp) do %SevenZ% e ""%%a.zip"" && %SevenZ% a -t7z -m0=lzma -mx=9 -mfb=64 -md=32m -ms=on -bd ""%%a.7z"" ""*.nds"" && rm ""%%a.zip"" *.nds
rm output.tmp"
