Latest release of the Complete rompack for the Nintendo DS, verified with clrmame using the release-list on: http://releases.pocketheaven.com/

With this release are a total of 1100 roms available in my rompacks on TPB.

New starting with this release is that the format of the roms is changed from ZIP to 7z. This gives an increase in compression by more than 10%. (Saved me 4GB on my entire nds-rom collection.) If your devkit doesn't support 7z natively use either WinRAR (http://www.rarsoft.com/) or 7z (http://www.7-zip.org/) to unpack. (Thanks to poke from bitslicker for inducing this change.)

I will keep using the release list from Pocket Heaven despite some others beeing updated more often. PH's list seldom include nukes and whatnot so it remains nice and clean.
