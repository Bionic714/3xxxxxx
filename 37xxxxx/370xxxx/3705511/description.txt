[quote]Apple has just released a new iPod advert, named ?Mi Swing Es Tropical?.  The new ad continues the silhouette dancer theme and features [b]Mi Swing Es Tropical[/b] by [i]Nickodemus & Quantic[/i] featuring [i]Tempo[/i][/quote]

I'm sure I'm not the only one who saw this ad and fell in love with the song and  the bright, vibrant colours and energy of the ad.  I tracked the song down and thought I would share it with others who might also be looking for it.  This is the full version of the song that plays in the ad.  It's a great ad and summer tune that both capture the vibrancy and joy for life that exudes from Latin American culture and music.    Enjoy.
