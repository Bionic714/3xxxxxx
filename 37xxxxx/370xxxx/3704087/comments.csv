Thanks ever so much nice one !made my day when I found this torrent . But I have downloaded the lot but am getting the error that the winzip archives are corrupted do you have any idea what i am doing wrong?"
,mikeofdoom,2008-05-28T21:21Z,Just...wow. There goes my bandwidth limit!
,Abstracta,2008-06-22T23:58Z,"I have many Bevis Frond albums, and it was nice to see this collection.

Unfortunately, it's in the VERY poor VCD format. VCD is hardly used anymore. DivX/Xvid gives a much better quality per MB. Or low compressed DVD (like 2-3 hours per disc). The latter takes much bigger space, but the quality is better.

I have downloaded it (all) just to have it. But I wish I could have a better version.

pschnob,
Could you please release a better version (if possible)?

But thanks for uploading this, Bevis Frond is great :)"

This collection was started back in the pre-DVDR days and VCD was the only real option (and the files weren't for torrenting, we were on dialup!, they were for burning/mailing/trading).  IMO VCD is equivalent to VHS quality-wise (but w/o the generational losses)...esp. when watched on a TV w/a proper home theater system (many of these recordings are from hifi stereo videotapes) that said I agree Divx would now be the better way to go but...sorry..no way i'm reripping all those videotapes!...it is what it is.  If you're looking for more recent Frond gig DVDs join the Yahoo group mentioned above.
