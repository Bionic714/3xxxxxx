,Olive74,2007-06-03T21:34Z,Is there a PPC version plz ?
,RomanSPQR,2007-06-04T00:21Z,"there is no ppc version.  x2 the threat is ppc though and you can probably find a torrent on de|V|onoid

If you do, please post the torrent on piratebay. thnx"
,RomanSPQR,2007-06-04T00:23Z,"update:  please increase your upload rate for this game either by increasing the number peers you upload to or your upload speed, it will pay off for you!"
,RomanSPQR,2007-06-04T00:35Z,update 2: I just found a way to *possibly* get better downloads:  change the tracker to http://inferno.demonid.com:3405/announce
,oligore,2007-06-15T16:05Z,This can't run on a macbook. Check specs b4 downloading
,Olive74,2007-06-16T00:22Z,Anybody hav The Movies (the game) on Mac in FR plz ? THX.
,RomanSPQR,2007-06-17T00:06Z,"its not a fake, it probably just doesn't work on your computer.

 read the specs!!!"
,RomanSPQR,2007-06-17T00:12Z,"***update***
if your game crashes when you're at a station and the computer is talking - turn off ""station announcements"" and you should be fine.

,toratai,2007-06-19T14:17Z,"Corrupt ZIP file!!! I have redownloaded this 2 times, now. I can't unzip the file. Something by the end of the archive is corrupt. I have tried with Stuffit Expander and Unarchiver. Anybody who has succeded? How to solve this?"
,RomanSPQR,2007-06-23T16:46Z,"That's weird that its not unzipping on your system, it worked fine on mine.  are you using the latest zip/unarchiver?"
,RomanSPQR,2007-06-23T16:47Z,"one way to solve the problem may be to free up disk space so that when it expands the file it can do it in one block, rather than in several places on your drive. (or defrag the disk)"
,toratai,2007-06-25T16:17Z,"Success! Here's how:
Stuffit doesn't work. Neither Unarchiver. BOMArchiveHelper (built into Mac OS X) opens this zip. Then I ran into the next problem. The OS doesn't mount the DMG, says it is an unknown format. So I tried to open it in Toast. Toast worked. I'm up and running! :-D Thanks RomanSPQR"
,RomanSPQR,2007-07-05T00:44Z,Glad you could get it working! Thanks for putting up the how2 toratai.
,k3vinjunk,2007-07-28T16:46Z,"First off the game installs just fine, this is not a fake.
Second, holy crap this game sucks! Basically a Homeworld 2 ripoff. For all of its hype as a beautiful and graphically intense game, it is full of bugs and tears really badly even on the best of systems. The game play is wonky and unintuitive. The audio and dialog is boring, unsynchronized and stupid. The story line is the same old bullshit ""find the religious duberhicky because if it falls into the wrong hands...blah blah blah."" I'm sure the game might get better if you have the patience to play through the first 3 hours of nonsense and boring missions and don't care about having crap ass graphic hickups. I am so glad I didn't buy this game. Deleting it now.  If you want to play a better version of this game download Homeworld 2."
,RomanSPQR,2007-08-25T20:02Z,"It actually resmbles EV:Nova more than Homeworld 2, but it shares some characteristics when you get to the station building aspects of the game.

There's a really long learning curve around 24gameplay hours. If you're into open ended games that involve rpg/rts/and civ like games than this is for you.

as far as bugs go, turn of station announcements and spend some time on the forums to make this game richer for you. its not a game for light playing."
,scrapetorrent,2007-08-27T23:07Z,"I don't get it, I just get asked for the product key when I click on start game, and I can't seem to find the product key anywhere.

Anyone?"
,RomanSPQR,2007-08-28T14:28Z,have you downloaded the crack in the other torrent?
,Argonex,2007-11-10T00:45Z,"Please can anyone put a product code here?  crack is crashing (Leopard)

Product Code is nowhere to find."
,RomanSPQR,2007-11-18T00:58Z,"argonex- It may be that the patch is not working in leopard - I'm still running 10.4.10.

Here's one work around: install x3 in an intel mac running pre-leopard then patch it.  copy the game to the computer running leopard. (and the associated saved games which will be somewhere in your home folder library).

it should work now.


this applies to Heroes V also."
,specmurt,2007-11-18T08:42Z,"Run crack using Rosetta. This will resolve Leopard issue. But anyway crack from other torrent doesn't work with this version of the game, it says cider executable has invalid SHA1 code."
,toplicius,2007-11-23T19:41Z,"Crack is not invalid, iPatcher 3.7 just don't work with Leopard. What I did is downloaded new iPatcher 3.7.1, created a dummy patch for some text files, then I've copied iPatcher executable from generated dummy from Contents/MacOS to the same folder on game patch, and woooohooooooo. 

Hope this helps..."
,specmurt,2007-11-24T12:11Z,"Mate, it worked like a charm. Thanks a lot!"
,theneptuneman12,2007-11-24T20:50Z,"I've been trying to get the crack for this game for days, could someone help me out - I've seeded the game itself 4 times, if someone would seed me the crack, or upload it for me, I'd happily seed that as well."
,aironfox,2007-12-19T19:49Z,plz somebody has the keygen???? help me plz!!!!
,Blackhawk1969,2008-01-29T03:25Z,"thanks for the warning kv3junk....and another good point... homeworld 2 runs on a macintosh ppc also..not just an Intellbox, cheaper processors for the same bullshit expensive price.. way to go apple.. gotta love that DRM"
,watertester,2008-02-15T15:52Z,seed please this looks awesome
,phanax,2008-03-31T20:05Z,"some more seeders please, it's going rather slow :o"
,phanax,2008-04-03T13:58Z,"I have a MacBook Pro from early-midsummer 2007, is it powerfull enough to play X3 well or will I experience a great ammount of lag?

Is this version already patched? I couldn't find any patches for the mac version on the official website.  Unless this is a cider I would understand such a thing, but wikipedia sais the game is ported for mac. A little confusing.

And I just got a few percentages left, so if someone aided me for just two or three hours now I'd be happy :) I got 6% left, if someone just put their upload to full I might have it in an hour :P"
,phanax,2008-04-04T06:04Z,"*nag nag nag* I need more seeders, stuck at 99.4% :P"
,phanax,2008-04-04T06:45Z,thanks everybody:D
,RomanSPQR,2008-05-07T19:26Z,"Phanax - your summer 2007 mbpro will run this.  I would not max out the graphics, this is a twitch based rpg and the high graphics will create lag.  Nevertheless, you can get some good graphics out of it before that happens.

the patch is out there for both leopard and 10.4 and earlier."
,Fallstaff,2008-05-11T07:30Z,"Oh, such an almost good game, just sooo very buggy. If I change views I can never get back to cockpit view (at least I can't figure out how).

I did manage to update and crack it by using the leopard crack on an updated version (this is the download version, not the box BTW) and then manually replacing the two files that the crack's log says are not updated from a copy of the cracked, but not updated copy. Clear as mud, no?

Thing is, after doing that my time compression dohicky (press 'j') stopped working on all versions of the game, my original, my updated, even a fresh install. Even if i delete the prefs.

Anyone have any ideas? 
I really want this thing to work. I'd be tempted to just send them the $45 if I didn't think it would be just as screwy.

Sigh."
,Fallstaff,2008-05-12T09:25Z,"Well I can now get it to activate the time compression sometimes. I had it working for hours last night and now it's failing again. I don't think it likes my old wingman...
Just frustrating. And it's a game that clearly is only worth playing if your want to invest hundreds of hours. 

Nice looking game, but I wouldn't recommend..."
,hagnag,2008-11-11T06:21Z,"works perfect, thanks"
,dr.M_A_V,2009-01-18T15:35Z,anybody seed please  
,dim0n_,2009-06-16T20:43Z,Please anybody seed this game!
,siba32,2009-08-30T09:24Z,Whats the product key????
,jayjonty,2010-03-21T12:24Z,"hey i put it on my mac but its still askin 4 a registration code.....
can u please help me with that......"
,RomanSPQR,2010-04-18T03:23Z,"update: If you have snow leopard this will almost certainly not play anymore without a legit code or a snow leopard crack.

also: the game is so cheap now that you really ought to buy it. its worth the money, i bought x3 reunion and terran conflict together for a reasonable price, check it out."
,skullhill,2010-04-22T12:26Z,"Ok guys this works well. You need to get the [Mac] X3: The Reunion No-SN fix (Leopard compatible) from DemonicznyKurczak also in the game disable station announcements, Its a bug in the game that causes crashes, Has nothing to do with this crack. I run this on my iMac that has 128 vid card at full specs and it works well."
