,ozzman1965,2011-04-27T09:32Z,This show is SO freakin funny!
[T],reactor90,2011-06-27T02:27Z,Pretty sad that the USA has to steal everything..
[V],maximersk,2011-06-28T23:00Z,"Sorry !
Is it version US ?"
,unpossible12,2011-06-29T01:32Z,Yeah that's it the USA stole it...the entire country stole it and now it's ours.
,theslywolf,2011-07-09T22:34Z,@reactor90 honestly you have a lot of nerve to assume your posting is anywhere close to being morally correct my friend. Belonging to TPB alone for even the slightest torrent makes your statement completely asinine and ignorant. That is all...
,Eivmriehfk,2011-07-09T23:41Z,Thanks for the upload. This is only the first of two seasons though.
,Wheezy,2011-07-12T11:07Z,"Honestly, I have to agree with reactor90, possibly not the statement itself, but the underlying point.
American's, from the eyes of an outsider, do terrible things to others idea's. I can quote a dozen TV series, movies and even books that needed to be either renamed, remade or even completely ripped off.
Kath and Kim, great aussie comedy, Americans (NBC) brought the rights and it completely bombed. Harry potter an the philosophers stone had to be renamed to Harry Potter and the  sorcerers stone, because Americans wouldn't get what a Philosopher meant. The Office, Awesome British comedy, the US version fucking sucks ass! It had to be remade just to suit an American audience, how arrogant can one nation be? ""oh we don't understand that, so instead of try to get the point of the series we will just remake it so we will get it.""
Skins, Life on Mars....i can go on, but i think the point is clear. Just count yourself lucky that Jason Gann is still Wilfred and still writes the US series."
,spifkitten99,2011-07-16T13:23Z,"reactor90, there are so many levels of stupidity in your comment.

Why can't you just appreciate that they thought the show was so good, that they wanted their own version?

They didn't steal it. They pay lots of money to the owners of the original show. They are the ones earning money on the US show.

Why should they not clone it? It's a good idea, a good show, a popular show. It would be stupid not to clone it.

Now don't try saying that the americans should watch the australian show instead. They aren't going to. So it makes perfect sense to produce an american version.

So lets' drop all the ridiculous fanboy bullshit about how the original of this and that should be the only one, whether it's australian, english, american or whatever.

Both shows are good. If you only like one of the, just only watch that one.

Again, just take it as a fucking compliment when a show from your country is cloned."
,spifkitten99,2011-07-16T13:30Z,"Wheezy, it's only your OPINION, that the US version of for example the office, sucks ass. It's nothing more than an OPINION.

I'm lucky enough to not live in neither US or UK, and thus I can enjoy both version.

Clearly YOU are the ignorant one, if you can't understand that another culture have a different kind of humor, and that it makes perfect sense to make a show based on their humor and culture.

But you are stupid enough to think that exactly your kind of humor is the correct kind of humor, and if people don't get it, they are stupid. Well guess what, you apparently don't get the humor of the american version, so maybe you are the stupid one.

Face it. It's just different, not necessarily worse."
,Smellyballz,2011-07-24T21:27Z,"@wheezy

You sound if the entire US of A steals everything from bull shit foreigners. I had no say in anything. Otherwise keep your opinions to yourself. Either rate or comment on this awesome show. Thanks Defiant777!!!!! Hail TPB"
,mizzllat,2011-07-27T03:59Z,"Both programs- the AU & the US versions- are written by basically the same team, with each run by the same basic production company.  This makes for some effing good programming, no matter how you want to look at it.

As for the US ""stealing"" all this programming, there sure is an awful lot of money going into the coffers of those being ripped off, don't you think, to make it theft, in any way you care to look at things.  Who cares who pays the writers, so long as they are getting a proper pay check, is the way I look at things.  Plus, it is awfully nice knowing that that vast, gaping maw known as ""cable TV"" is being kept fed (alive, if not perfectly well-nourished )by all these remakes, recasts, and first-American-run programs (BBC-America's lifeblood).  If it were not, we'd all be stuck (ALL of us, not just ""US"") watching endless reruns of- excellent, but horribly dated- programs such as ""Maude"" (known in the British remake as ""Nobody's Perfect""), ""The Golden Girls"" (aka ""The Brighton Girls"" in the UK's 1993 release), or even something a bit more edgy like ""Married... with Children"" (known as ""Married for Life"" when rewritten and cast for British airwaves).

While there might seem to be some truth to the notion that it is cheaper to simply pay to have a successful program retooled for a new market than it is to start from scratch, truth is, this simply is not so.  The real problem is, there is so very much airtime to fill, and not nearly enough good ideas with which to fill them, so you take what's out there and squeeze it until every drop of funny has been shed, or every noteworthy moment finally confessed.  Good ideas are rarely rejected, but they ARE few and far between, and much, much harder to come by than many people seem to understand.  That is why truly good writers make so much money are are so greatly and eagerly sought out.  Especially for rewrites, whether the idea is new or a rehash of an already circulated program."
,3nipples,2011-08-31T06:48Z,thanks 
,elessarGObonzo,2011-09-10T05:41Z,"hey, if we can steal our whole country, what's jus a lil tv show? ;}"
,elessarGObonzo,2011-09-12T01:58Z,"Molly Shannon was fucking funny, Kath & Kim was a good show!"
,anaddict,2011-09-15T15:40Z,There's no such thing as good humor. You must be full of yourself if you believe that one's country's humor is better than the others. How can you say America stole Wilfred when the owners sold it and the creators helped write the American version.
,terry_rist41,2011-12-07T11:37Z,"When they say stealing they don't mean it literally, i thought that may be obvious but clearly i was wrong... as to the people saying that americans are stupid, ignorant, under taught and stuff like that, i completely agree; in my personal experiences americans are stupid etc. but will you all please stop going on about stuff as little as this and move on?! go have a cry.  "
,s934523,2011-12-14T02:23Z,"It isn't arrogance.  As an American the international shows are great.  When they get ""Americanized"" it's a damn shame, but it's because our giant corporations think everything needs to be dumbed down to the lowest common denominator.

It's a corporate evil, some marketing geniuses opinion, and not an overall American evil.

You know the type, marketing majors?  We should just make fun of every one of their idea's the world over and the planet would be a much smarter, much better place."
