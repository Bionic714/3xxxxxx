DISK1\MAGNiTUDE\Program files and paste on it's places

DO NOT JUST copy and paste DISK1\MAGNiTUDE\Program files over

,nx5xn,2008-04-16T17:43Z,warning .. after 60 days files prt will unable to open
,CoupedUp,2008-04-16T18:36Z,"I am stuck...I have a few questions.

1) What do you mean Install UGS License Server? Install it a second time? Or something to do with the Licensing Tools???

2) Also in the .lic file, should it be:

""SERVER this_host ID=""PCName""
VENDOR ugslmd""

Nothing after the PCName right? Or should there be a number after such as ""28000""?

3) During install it asked for FlexLM Server(s). What should I put in there?

4)After 60 days prt files will be unable to open? Huh?

Thanks!"

,kriok67,2008-08-21T00:54Z,"Hi,
I,ve reintalled NX5 in my PC, and i can't open old files from nx5. My old files from nx3, from 2 year ago, I can. when I try, this message apears:
""Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library

I'm running cracked NX 5.0.2.2 on windows xp pro.

Any suggestions on what the problem might be?

,likeathiefinthenight,2008-09-04T23:31Z,Anyone know where I can find either NX 5 or NX 6 for linux?  Anyone seen it around.  Can't seem to find a real one anywhere.  DL'd one already but turned out to be mislabeled and was for windows.

,directprop,2008-11-11T05:43Z,"Does anyone know why I'm getting this error?

Cannot connect to license server system.
The server (lmgrd) has not been started yet, or the wrong port@host or license file is being used, or the TCP/IP port or host name in the license file has been changed"
,directprop,2008-11-11T16:16Z,"Continued....

1. When I launch License Options ther are no Bundle's shown to select.

2.  When I launch NX 5.0 I receive this error;

     Initialization error -
     NX License Error: The license server has not 
     been started yet, or UG_License_Server is 
     set to the wrong port@host. [-15 ]

3.  When I launch lmtools the server is running.

4.  I also verified with task manager that  ""ugslmd.exe"" & ""lmgrd.exe"" are running.

5.  I also verified that ""Sentinnel"" is running.

6.  I added all the cracked files of ""ugs_common.dll and replaced what was in all directories.

7. #10 on your ""Installation Notes"" I'm assuming is not correct.  You have to copy from cracked file ""Magnitude\ugs_common.dll"" which there is no .dll file there but there is one in cracked files \UGS\NX 5.0\NXPLOT which is the file I used to overwite this one.

8.  I think I covered all my bases here but I still can't see any license bundles to select.  I even went to the UG Licensing guide and verifed everything was correct.

If you could please respond with what I might be doing wrong it would be greatly appreciated.

,j33v3s,2009-01-05T18:08Z,"Right, after much searching on the internet I've got this working. I will now write how I did it in hopefully a simple to understand way, so anyone can install this brilliant program (and in my case, finally do my coursework :P)
As alot of the guides say it's important to install the license server first I shall follow that order to avoid confusion, but it doesn't actually matter since I installed NX5 first.

1) Run Launch to get the splash screen with four buttons
2) Click install UGS License Server
(alternatively, if you know what you're doing you can go directly into the license folder and run setup.exe)
3) Open the NX5.lic file with notepad (it is in the MAGNiTUDE folder)
4) Edit the first line so that it says
""SERVER this_host ID=""PCName""
VENDOR ugslmd"" 28000
where this_host is your PC name (can be found by going Control Panel>System>Computer Name)
5) Follow the instructions and when it asks for the location of the license file, locate it (doesn't matter where it is, I put it in C:/Program Files/UGS)

6) Go back to the launch splash screen you opened earlier
7) Click Install NX5
(alternatively, if you know what you're doing you can go directly into the NX5 folder and run setup.exe)
8) Select custom install and select all options
9) At some point during install it'll ask for the server hostname or something similar (basically a test box where you have to type something), it should already be computer_name@28000. If not, write your computer name then @28000.
10) Copy over the .dll files in the MAGNiTUDE folder into their correct places in the UGS/NX5 folder. Don't worry about NASTRAN if you haven't installed it.
11) Restart computer (not sure if this is necessary, but I did)
12) Start>All Programs>UGS NX 5.0>NX Licensing Tools>License Options
13) Select whatever bundles you want (don't know what they actually do, if someone can enlighten me please do)
14) Click ok, then run NX 5

Hope this helps people
Thanks to MAGNiTUDE for a great upload"
,Hamidku,2009-01-24T22:40Z,"when I open the nx5.lic I have this at the top: 

""SERVER this_host ID=20070424 28000
VENDOR ugslmd""

Should I change this to ""My computer name=20070424 28000 VENDOR ugslmd""???

thanks"
,Hamidku,2009-01-24T23:32Z,"by the way, will this work with vista???"
,geotech,2009-01-28T04:59Z,"J33v3s  is correct with his method I can confirm it. though part of his instructions were slightly wrong. 
In step 9 it says ""9) At some point during install it'll ask for the server hostname or something similar (basically a test box where you have to type something), it should already be computer_name@28000. If not, write your computer name then @28000.""  but that is wrong. It must be      28000@computer_name   then it will work. Small mistake everything else works ...Props to J33v3s"
,Darude90,2009-02-05T01:19Z,"can anyone please help me on how to install nx5? im lost here:

4) Edit the first line so that it says
""SERVER this_host ID=""PCName""
VENDOR ugslmd"" 28000

so lets say my pc name is Laptop then it should be like this?

""SERVER Laptop ID=""PCName""
VENDOR ugslmd"" 28000

or how?"
,idcool,2010-02-12T13:16Z,"right lets clear this up! 

because i was confused too.

this is what i did with the license file and it works...


what you do is find your pc name (which has already been explained on how to do that)

then where it says ""this_host"" replace it with your computer name

e.g. 

you start with:

SERVER this_host ID=20070424 28000
VENDOR ugslmd


if your computer name is    bob-5637

then it will goto:

SERVER bob-5637 ID=20070424 28000
VENDOR ugslmd


You can save this file anywhere when installing the license server.

BUT when you have installed the NX5 program itself make sure you save this modified file in this folder:

Program files\UGS\NX 5.0\UGFLEXLM\

i recommend a look at willzville's guide on page 1

hope that helps"
