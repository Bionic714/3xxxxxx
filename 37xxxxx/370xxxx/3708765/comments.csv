,kofmiester,2007-08-13T07:32Z,"Now all this is all well and good. But for the Mac users, what're they gonna do? cause even if they format the iPod on the windows machine to achieve this, after syncing a couple of times on their mac, the computer will not see the iPod and will have to restore. How will mac users achieve this? Is there anyway to achieve this hack? I mean, I will be able to get up to the invisible folders and probably copying files from the pc but what about the iPod Firmware? Windows computers cannot write to Mac formatted iPods...."

,Creator_of_torrent,2007-10-22T05:54Z,"If done, correctly, does work 95% of time. For example, some times games don't start properly. All you do is just restart the game. You can always reset your firmware if you have problems. "

,Toomuchmusic,2007-12-19T08:30Z,"This does work, i have over sixty gb of music and videos on my ipod, i was leary of trying this but IT WORKS!! I had to do it twice the first time because i had my itunes game tab set to import the game file and it erased it the first time, but the second time i did it took 2 minutes literally. I put this on my gf's ipod and my mom's ipod. NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER! Easy and awesome. Just make sure you check to see if you have the ""search"" option in your ipod before you start the process or it has to be stopped to checked and done again, also make sure you put the right firmware. 5.5 if you have search in your ipod and 5 if not. MANY THANKS!!!"

,Grayfox44,2008-01-22T00:35Z,"This worked 100%

has a good selection of games, although new ones have come out. i suggest you get the cracked firmware from this torrent, the newer version of iPodWizard from 

http://www.ipodwizard.net/cmps_index.php

and the games from a more updated torrent.

other than that its a great torrent!"

,Toomuchmusic,2008-04-28T06:27Z,"i did this to two 80gb ipods once twice because noone said if you accidentally update your ipod it takes away the games, lol o well, and also a 30 gb ipod and it worked fine. Takes only five minutes and it also didn't erase anything like almost every other one on here does. Great work."

Please note that if u have an older verson than the fifth, it will not work..

Besides that, it's a great torrent=)"

,Yurn,2009-06-09T09:53Z,No bitch this doesnt work for the 120gb ipod classic
,AngelosDracul,2009-09-16T23:05Z,"Ok, for the record, this ONLY WORKS on 5, and 5.5g version of the iPod Video Classic (big, bulky, hard drive version... comes in White and Black). You can find out which version you have by looking in your menu. If you do NOT have a search option, you have a 5g. If you DO have a search option, you have a 5.5g. Simple as that. And you can get a list of models, and what they look like on Apple's site, and on Wiki. As far as the iPod erasing after you flash? False. It will erase your music and videos if you do not EJECT the iPod before unplugging it. You can do this in iTunes, OR Explorer (right click on your ipod under ""drives"" and click ""eject"") Wait for the menu to pop up on your iPod, THEN unplug. This will happen even if you are on the NEWEST firmware. And has NOTHING to do with this hack."
