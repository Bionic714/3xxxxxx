,bigboss17,2007-06-01T20:08Z,"This is a slimmed down version of Windows XP. It is really fast because it doesn't have a lot of the crap that usually bogs down Windows like Internet Explorer. I really don't have that great of a description for this because this is not an official M*croso*t product. I tested this and it works really fast. It's not a good idea to install it alongside an official copy of Windows XP. No serial is required for the install and the OS doesn't need to be activated. Have fun with this and let me know how it goes.

Here is a little bit about it

Performance tweaks:
Usb Polling increased to 250.
Tcp Simaltanious Downloads increased to 100
File protection removed
Unsigned themes support added

Integrated Energy Bliss Deluxe, complete with Energy Bliss Scrn saver
and Vista Cursor pack. No wallpaper (takes up valuable graphics resources).

Ryans' Update Pack Aug 14 2006:
with hundreds of post sp2 critical updates.

No WGA required, bypasses right to updates.

Programs added to Desktop for optional install:
PGWARE.ALLProducts.v1.5.8.2006.WinALL.Cracked-ARN
PGWARE.GameBoost.v1.5.8.2006.WinALL.Cracked-ARN
PGWARE.GameGain.v2.5.8.2006.WinALL.Cracked-ARN
PGWARE.PCBoost.v3.5.8.2006.WinALL.Cracked-ARN
PGWARE.PCMedik.v6.5.8.2006.WinALL.Cracked-ARN
PGWARE.SuperRAM.v5.5.8.2006.WinALL.Cracked-ARN
PGWARE.Throttle.v6.5.8.2006.WinALL.Cracked-ARN
PGWARE.GameBoost.v1.5.8.2006.WinALL.Cracked-ARN"

,n1ghtsn1p3r,2007-07-04T20:53Z,"Nevermind, it is in English.

,rexster99,2007-07-19T00:28Z,"imho, any xp gamer iso should include emulators to play ps2/nds/psp/gb/etc.....

tnx!"
,Zellkyou,2007-07-31T22:34Z,"Im not sure about this but if i install this will i lose all my music, game shit, and videos, cuz that WOULD NOT be good, obiviously"
,007ace,2007-08-01T06:19Z,"what a joke, guy uploads an OS for us, says its for games and wont tell us exactally what he's changed. 
I dont know about anyone else, but that sounds like a bad idea to me. 
And i wouldnt trust a virus scan of the iso done b4 the install cause there are way more things that can screw over a system when installed from scratch

,vattenskalle89,2007-08-03T21:33Z,"i think you shuold write what stuff you've removed and what still is there dude,,,,,,,, skriv upp det du tagit bort/lagt till så blir det lite lättare att fatta vad man tankar ner.....   hade"
,Kleppemeister,2007-08-07T06:11Z,"If you read his post he hasent changed anything at all on this. But if this is the real thing. Gamer Edition, then its the guy that made Mindows that made this. And it is performing better then Mindows, most things are removed, I dont remember if he did add browser suport or not to Gamer Edition. But its perferct for gaming. Earlyer Gamer Edition XP's ive used is pretty good. Using Vista now, but need something for my gamer PC until I see a point in using DX10. "
,Kleppemeister,2007-08-08T01:53Z,"This is really slow when you get over 70%, I mean really slow, before 70% i downloaded with 20kb. Now its stuck from 0.5 to 2 kb.
