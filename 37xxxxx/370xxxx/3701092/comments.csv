,Kiweed,2011-01-11T19:05Z,"I have sorted the 0 seed/peer problem and am now downloading. Its not very fast but, its better than nothing ;) For some reason this torrent was made a private torrent and therefor there is no DHT, Local peer discovery or Local peer exchange allowed and none of the trackers that are associated with it work either!!! Thats why it is basically dead, as is... However, you can add trackers to torrents as you please, so all you got to do is add as many different trackers as possible... Some of them will work and some will not but, you should find some that work (as I have) and get some seeds and download speed :D Hope this helps others who have the same problem... Cheers ;)"

,SixLo,2011-09-14T04:44Z," Duh, oops. Forgot to thank all the kind souls   seeding too. Read all the comments. I LIKE this group.
 PS... I promise to to seed at least 5 times what I download unless my PC dies (or I do). My PC is slow (70 -80kB/s up :-( ), but it runs almost 24/7. Just had a thought. A good seeding goal might be about 4.20 to 1 ??? Find Peace!"
,98ujiko,2011-12-23T02:25Z,says 8 seeds but I've been trying to download this for like 20 hours now and still 0 and 0. If anyone can give me a hand I'd appreciate it. This is a collection I'd love to have. gullblast@gmail.com
