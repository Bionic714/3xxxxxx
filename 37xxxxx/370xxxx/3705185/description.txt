:. about .:

An innocent camping trip into the Nevada desert takes a deadly turn 
when military black operations test a new viral weapon codename 
Project G.I.Ants, designed to create battle field infantry by mutating 
commonly found insects and parasites. When this test run goes horribly 
wrong the lives of 8 friends and a desert community is altered irrevocably.

Waking up in a jail appearing to be in New York the player, an urban girl 
in her late teens, must remember what happened and set off to find her 
friends and save them from the madness. There is of course a couple of 
problems....

The presence of the virus >Triton-76" used by "Project G.I.Ants< in the 
surrounding air starts to trigger powerful and frightening mutations in the 
player and a standard order for the elimination of any witness.
