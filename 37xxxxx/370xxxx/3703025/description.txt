I got a woman/ amen
Love me
Tryin' to get to you
All shook up
Love me tender
you don't have to say you love me
Hound dog
Fever
Polk salad annie
Why me Lord
Suspicious minds
Band introductions
I can't stop loving you
Help me
Bridge over troubled water
Let me be there
Spanish eyes
Big boss man
Funny how time slips away
Can't help falling in love
(recorded live, May 24, 1974, midnight show, Lake Tahoe)
