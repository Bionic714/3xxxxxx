,Slimjim147,2008-08-06T12:38Z,do you need to burn this to a dvd?
,notabook,2008-09-04T01:27Z,"Video Quality:  6/10
Sound Quality:  7/10

Overall I'd recommend trying to get the dual audios that have higher quality, but since these are already ready to be burned to a DVD player, and 15 eps instead of 4 typically found the quality is expected to be lower anyways."
,Doomgaze_89,2008-10-31T11:54Z,"Seed plz :) Just love this anime :) 


and download VLC player if you are looking for something to play the files in!
It plays most files :) 
There is a great download here on piratebay. With 14 extra skins, working really good. "
