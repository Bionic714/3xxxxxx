Synopsis:   Steve McQueens last movie shows the dynamic talent of the late great actor in one of his most memorable roles: The true story of Ralph "Papa" Thorson, a modern day bounty hunter. Thorsons exploits are detailed as he pursues a number of fugitives who had skipped bail. The chase comes full circle when he becomes the quarry of a vengeful psychopath. McQueens multi-dimensional performance as Thorson, a man born in the wrong age, is counterpoint to the explosive action in The Hunter.
