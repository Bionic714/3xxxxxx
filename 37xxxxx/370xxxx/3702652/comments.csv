,duuhan,2008-10-12T05:41Z,"Just wondering, is there finnish subs?"
,CainUAC,2009-07-23T11:09Z,"oh thats great right there, 

Subtitles: English....... and then, English for deaf people

it takes great talent and special detail to make two separate english subtitles.  also, isn't Swedish close enough to Finnish? i mean crap man, there is even Norwegian, what more do you want??

by the way, didn't Stalone do a remake of this a while back?  like Judge Dredd or somethin?"
,CainUAC,2009-07-23T11:09Z,at least he didn't say English for Blind people.
