The DWL-G122 is a Wireless USB 2.0 adapter that installs quickly and easily into any desktop or laptop PC with an available USB port. You can simply plug in the DWL-G122 to enjoy the freedom of wireless networking. When used with other D-Link AirPlus G products in their default configuration, the DWL-G122 automatically discovers and connects to the wireless network.

Like all other D-Link wireless adapters, the DWL-G122 Wireless USB Adapter can be used in peer-to-peer mode (ad-hoc) to directly connect to other 802.11b/g wirelessly enabled computers for direct file sharing, or in client mode (infrastructure) to connect with wireless access points or routers.

* Maximum wireless signal rate derived from IEEE Standard 802.11g specifications. Actual data throughput will vary. Network conditions and environmental factors, including volume of network traffic, building materials and construction, and network overhead, lower actual data throughput rate. Environmental factors will adversely affect wireless signal range.
** Compatible with USB 1.1 port. If used with 1.1 port, throughput may be diminished.
