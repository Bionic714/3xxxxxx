This is to replace the corrupt torrent uploaded yesterday.  This one has been hash checked multiple times, and I'm sure it will work this time.  I also encoded at a lower (but still high quality) variable bitrate (around 192kbps) to decrease the size of the file.  I'm sorry for all the problems, but this has been frustrating for me as well.  I hope you Webb Wilder fans will understand and cut me a little slack on this one.  Thanks!

PS. Sorry, Part 2.  Broken scanner = No covers.
