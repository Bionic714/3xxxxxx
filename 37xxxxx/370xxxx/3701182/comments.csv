,wb_bb_617,2007-07-26T08:28Z,"@jroc
i havent downloaded this yet, but i presume its because the file size is still the same ~175meg, but the res is higher, thus lower overall quality video"

,Delanoxx99,2007-10-04T13:07Z,how do u get it to work because the file are atv and all it does is play the voice and no screen just sing
,Z3R0OneOneSe7en,2007-10-29T18:26Z,YEah the quality is all right for TV Rips some of them are DVD quailty. Get this if your worried about  space if you rather wait for a DVD rip..well keep waiting.
,m4x0rz,2007-11-29T13:04Z,I bet FOX is just trying to sabatoge things by leaving fake bad comments. =P
,Jovog,2007-12-27T01:04Z,why does everybody say that this is season 5 when it is season 6!!?!?! i found season 5 in the store and these wasn't the parts!!??!?! :@
,The Living Homer,2008-01-15T07:26Z,"Thanks, the quality looks good. But this is not standard DVD resolution. Standard DVD resolution is 720x480. That's what I upload my video(s) at. Anyways, thanks and will comment on the quality."
,compl3x,2008-02-03T06:41Z,ugh... This sucks. The volume is down low and is of poor quality. Steer clear.
,astro2,2008-02-24T13:41Z,"shut up ""KillCapitalism"" its the 21st century amazingly good quality is pretty much the standard these day

i.e with computer stuff getting faster and cheaper having a lame capture card is no excuse anymore

plus everything is HD aswell, pretty much all tv shows are beyond average

look up any tv show and I guarantee you its HD quality or close to dvdrip divx stuff.

if this torrent is what I think it is, then yes its true there's no blur and fuzziness, but its not rich in colour and its crap 

and dont' give me crap about its not on dvd

season 6 is already out so season 5 MUST be on dvd, and also in my collection some of it is proper divx rip with beautiful colours, whilst the rest is very light in colour and soft audio EXPLAIN THAT

i.e there's no excuse, different ripper means different quality...bad quality means tightass jerks who didn't fork money for a real card."

plus the quallity is enough and its lower memory =]"
,torrentlover83,2008-04-10T18:41Z,"This IS season 5.  There is a pretty exhaustive list of episodes for USA seaons on Wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Family_Guy_episodes ) and you can plainly see that season 5 is listed as such.  If in the UK or any country other than the USA, you will find that the seasons are different.  For instance, here in the UK there is a Season SIX DVD set that is in fact, Season FIVE as listed on this torrent.  This is because Season Three got split in two and mixed around."
,shazzaB,2008-04-23T01:25Z,ace torrent. turned out fine but here in europe it's season 6. class download
,kamoflauge,2008-05-29T05:33Z,"shut up ""astro2"" its the 21 century that means no one says lame anymore and no one calls a video card a capture card or double post. And i like what you said here ""bad quality means tightass jerks who didn't fork money for a real card"" whats that suppose to mean you got a lose asshole from getting all kinds of people and things stuck up there."

thanks bloodlogic"
,mufuti9,2008-07-06T21:54Z,"Well if this is anything like the season 4 LOL release I can understand completely why people bitch about the quality. LOL has disappointed me one too many times now. There are awesome releases out today, LOL is one of the fastest sure. But check out 2HD and the like. They are the new quality standard, same size just more work put into with a much better HD source and compression obviously(no, its no DVD)!

Also - I assume this is a bundle of FOX airings? Most episodes are CUT.

Only AdultSwim airs them uncut - and DVDrips of course.

Guess I have to continue my search :E"
