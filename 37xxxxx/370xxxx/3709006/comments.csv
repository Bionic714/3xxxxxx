,Demonix SD,2007-06-09T09:36Z,"Heya Mate,

I'm running Vista x64 Ultimate.

I've just tried installing Alcohol with BetaMaster's new patch, many, many times in a row, doing it loads of different ways.

It didn't work.

Basically, it seems to work, allows me to actually start Alcohol (main window, bypasses normal 'enter serial' box), but then asks for a serial (after it tries to apply a virtual drive).

I've also tried 'forcing' the serial into Alcohol using BetaMaster's older (v4719) patch, and then using the new patch too, but it doesn't work.

Maybe it's Just Vista...

(I DID everything right;
Disabled UAC.
Used Admin Rights.
Unplugged LAN.
Cleaned Registry Before (thoroughly).
Restarted @ every possible combination of times (I tried many different reinstalls hoping I could get it working).

Anyone who got BetaMaster's latest Patch working (especially in Vista) - please guide us on how u did it successfully!

Thanx. ^_^

(Thanx to BetaMaster!, and thanx zero-hour for posting here!)"

Is there a crack that works? I've been looking for days."

,zero_hour,2007-06-10T10:50Z,"Forget all other methods.

Please try this one. I have heard many ppl saying this works.

,Sliztzan,2007-06-12T22:58Z,"yep, thats the only one that worked for me.  Better instructions and has IP blocking instructions."
,setiguy2007,2007-06-19T19:48Z,"Don't waste your time.  Instead use BlindWrite v6.0.4.36, much easier to key gen or find working serials or crack and has all the features of Alcohol 120 except for the ""virtual drive"" function.  Smaller footprint too.
