,Cyberpro60,2007-08-12T07:08Z,"Thanks for a great torrent with really great recordings. My only complaint is that there is little useful information provided about the artists/orchestras involved. 

eg. Who is Uruvayev? What orchestra is playing?
There is not one single reference to Uruvayev on google so who knows if this is who is really playing!@ 

The label given is ""Infinity Digital"" but there are no Mozart titles listed under this label? Why has this person created fictitious artists/labels for his release?"

Sorry I took so long to reply. Piratebay doesn't notify me of comments.

I ran a google search on 'Uruvayev' and it retrieved 461 results, the entire first page of results referring to Sergei Uruvayev, the pianist in question.

I have tried to make sure that my files contain enough information such that if people want to know more about the performers or the performances, they can google it.

There are of course a few exceptions. Throughout my baroque ensemble collection, I might mention the conductor, or the name of the ensemble in the filename, which is usually enough to track down the original cd, but occasionally a conductor will have worked with one ensemble early in his/her career, then moved to another for a second recording of the same piece. 

The same problem would occur if Sergei Uruvayev recorded these same Mozart pieces again, but with a different orchestra.

A better way to categorise classical music would be to use Tags. I could then assign keywords to the files which give specific detail of their origin. Until such time as this technology is widespread however, I'm satisfied with my current format.
