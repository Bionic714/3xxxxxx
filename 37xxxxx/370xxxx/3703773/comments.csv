,sjørøver-ole,2007-06-24T13:09Z,Any possibilities to get this album in FLAC? MP3 (or any compressed audio formats) is horrible to use with black metal:p
,kjeld666,2007-06-27T14:24Z,"I don't put op music in Flac format sorry, flac files become far to big (500 mb, 1 album).
Besides MP3 was meant to be as a smaller format then .wav for example.
If you don't like mp3's and/or it's quality then i advise you to buy the album(s) original."
