,007craft,2007-06-09T23:30Z,it was not uploading for some reason despite being connected to 30 people.  It seems to be going at 80k upload now.
,H Moilanen,2007-06-15T18:05Z,Finnish subtitle doesn't work. Anyone else got the same problem?
,007craft,2007-06-18T07:04Z,"On my dvd player, english subs show up as a differnet language, yet when i play it on the computer, english subs work fine.  Looks like dvd lab pro has some authoring issues with subtitles.  OH well.  I included the .srt of the subs with the torrent so you can easily add them in with tons of different programs.  

Try pushing the subtitle button on your remote instead of selecting them from the menu, that might work."

,Greatest_Pirate_Hunter,2008-05-20T19:11Z,"Someone PLEASE SEED this!

I HATE pan & scan...& that's all that's available here in the USA (aside from an HD DVD).  :(

I even have a copy of the American fullscreen DVD right here on my lap.  I checked it out from the library, but would rather download this & watch it in its beautiful widescreen."
,Greatest_Pirate_Hunter,2008-06-13T08:32Z,"Can anyone seed, please?!

We're all stuck at 98.9%!!!  :'(

If you have this, please seed, it won't even take you very long...just a mere 1.1% until we all have it completed."
,falcon7,2008-06-21T01:36Z,Plez seed to 10 peers waiting at 98.9%!!!!!!!!!
,Greatest_Pirate_Hunter,2008-07-09T05:08Z,"All right.  I've been stuck at 98.9% for about a month now.  There are no seeds & I'm the only one with this much downloaded.  I'm going to have to delete this soon, because 4.33 GB is too much for me to hold onto, especially when it's unlikely we'll ever get any seeds.  Sorry.

If anyone can re-upload an ISO of the WS version of this movie though, please do so!  That would be really great if you did.  Thanks."
