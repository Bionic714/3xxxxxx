,HooglyBoogly,2007-06-02T14:00Z,How is it working for you?
,trev777,2007-06-02T16:21Z,burned to disc with poweriso but can't seem to find set up or install files
,HooglyBoogly,2007-06-02T17:44Z,hmm They should be in there. Is anybody else having any problems?
,mJohnsson,2007-06-03T13:42Z,"You gotta reboot the computer with the CD in the reader, that's all you gotta do. If it doesn't work, make sure the boot priority in BIOS is set to cd drive first (press F2 or somehting when your computer is starting up)

I installed it, like it a lot, but I can't get my sound card to work!! I've tried with THREE, aureal vortex, creative sound blaster and now aztech as well, anyone else has this problem? I gotta reinstall my windows to my old version again to make it work?"
,sikmajik,2007-06-08T03:52Z,I want this...just waiting to see if this sound card problem is a fluke or persistent. mJohnsson? Fixed or fuggedaboudit?
,mJohnsson,2007-06-10T23:52Z,"If you have an external PCI soundcard like me, I'd advise you not to download this. I had to reformat and reinstall with another version of windows xp, this one:

But on my little brothers computer (more modern) I think this performance edition worked fine, a tip is making sure you have or can find the drivers necessary to install windows, cos with this version you're probably gonna have to do it by yourself. Like with the older versions of windows, 95, 98 etc."
,HooglyBoogly,2007-06-11T04:38Z,"Thank you for the comments. I will amke sure not to give them to the original maker of this becasue I don't even know who made it.... lol. I dled it form btjunkie awhile ago and didn't see it on here, so I said to myself, ""wtf. It's worth a shot."" 

I digress...

Anwyays, thanks especially to mJohnnson on figuring out what the problem was and how to resolve it. :)"
,Deecid86,2007-10-25T13:07Z,"Thanks alot, this works like a Charm!.

,nmatasa,2008-06-17T22:00Z,"""All Languages and Keyboards are now supported"". "
,nmatasa,2008-06-17T22:02Z,It is not true that All Languages and Keyboards are now supported. Slovenian is not. And what's worse is I couldn't find a way to add it later. So I'm going with a different edition.
,HooglyBoogly,2008-06-21T20:09Z,I wish you lot would stop bitching at me about any problems you may have with this. I'm not the one that made it guys!
,tHe.WeBmInStEr,2008-07-05T13:47Z,"Works like a charm, tks to both the creator and the uploader. :)"
,bwahness,2008-12-11T02:11Z,"This worked great for dual-booting with Linux.  A big problem I'm having though is that I have no way of getting a wireless connection with it.  I don't even see anything having to do with wireless under Network Connections.  There also seems to be no sound, but once I get the internet going I think it'll be easier to update things like that."
,yt1DER,2008-12-13T21:02Z,can we please seed?
,theeye3,2008-12-16T12:23Z,"LOL
Automatic Updates REMOVED

much fun with this crap"
,delabrandoso,2008-12-24T07:34Z,"I was really excited about how well this was working... until I realized that the majority of the printers that I have rely on the generic printer drivers that come preloaded on XP to install correctly.  

They each request the XP install CD now, in order to acquire the driver info they need, but this iso of course will not work for that - there are literally no drivers present whatsoever for printers.  Good luck to anyone who needs to do a quick print on a new printer."
,patc92,2008-12-29T16:05Z,"I downloaded this, or a version similar to this, and iTunes will not work. Has anyone got any ideas?"
,LondonOntGuy,2009-01-17T06:51Z,"Just a warning for those that might not know. If you have any external drives, unplug them until you've completed the install. 

Because if you don't, it will assume you want to install to one of them instead of your C: drive and you'll end up formatting your external."
,wildnyc5,2009-10-07T20:07Z,"Hey-have installed Parallels 4 on my mac and need to bun this verson of windoes to a CD then install quickbooks..
