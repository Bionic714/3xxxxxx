,Pipett,2007-11-16T15:38Z,"Skiftande kvalitet, mest dålig. Ljudnivån är väldigt olika på låtarna. Rekommenderas ej."

,Maria0305,2008-09-21T21:47Z,STFU @danley. Jesus. How hard is it to just change the fucking titles of the songs?? 
,NaldoxC,2008-12-20T05:39Z,"My first and favorite torrent downloaded.  As someone else mentioned, some of the titles are of a little, but for 100 great songs, I wouldn't care if all of the names were wrong."

,ghytwembpang,2009-05-28T22:32Z,"haha, excellent, just what I was looking for... I'm gonna take all these songs and smash them all together, and make some totally terribly awesome remixes of them. Maybe I'll combine them all into one song. WHO KNOWS!?"

,SystemFolder,2009-07-30T03:51Z,"@p4r4m: Because Britney Spears is not '80s music, duh. Her first single, ...Baby One More Time, was released in 1998."
