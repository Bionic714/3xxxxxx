,RomanSPQR,2007-06-05T18:07Z,"this will crack the v2.0.02 of x3, but every now and then the game will realize its been cracked and quit on you.  so far it only has happened when you're leaving a station so if you keep the station autosave on you should be fine."
,k3vinjunk,2007-07-28T16:40Z,"Holy crap this game sucks! Basically a Homeworld 2 ripoff. For all of its hype as a beautiful and graphically intense game, it is full of bugs and tears really badly even on the best of systems. The game play is wonky and unintuitive. The audio and dialog is boring, unsynchronized and stupid. The story line is even boring. I'm sure the game gets better if you have the patience to play through the first 3 hours of nonsense and boring missions. I am so glad I didn't but this game. Deleting it now. But this crack does work for those interested in seeing how bad it really is. If you want to play a better version of this game download Homeworld 2."
,RomanSPQR,2007-08-18T17:42Z,"It actually resmbles EV:Nova more than Homeworld 2, but it shares some characteristics when you get to the station building aspects of the game.

There's a really long learning curve around 24gameplay hours.  If you're into open ended games that involve rpg/rts/and civ like games than this is for you.

as far as bugs go, turn of station announcements and spend some time on the forums to make this game richer for you.  its not a game for light playing."
,scrapetorrent,2007-08-27T23:11Z,"Please seed, no one is seeding at the moment :("
,RomanSPQR,2007-08-28T16:12Z,i'm seeding it again intermittently until others pick it up. 
,dexluce,2007-10-31T20:43Z,Please seed 21% -_-''
,Argonex,2007-11-10T00:44Z,"i""m looking for a Product Code...   Crack is crashing (under leopard)"
,kcammoun,2007-11-16T10:34Z,"hey RomanSPQR i need help for heroesV . I apply crack on app., says complete, I still get asked for registration code.."
,RomanSPQR,2007-11-18T00:54Z,"Argonex - many of the patches out for ciderized games are having trouble working leopard so I think you may need to find yourself another patch (and post it up here if you have)

Kcammoun - sorry for the delayed response to your queries.  I've put a note on the heroes board which may help (or not) but in any case - one thing that is popping up is that leopard + recent patches don't work so you may be facing that problem."
,specmurt,2007-11-18T08:46Z,"> this will crack the v2.0.02 of x3

What does it mean v2.0.02? The version of the game on d2m DVD is 1.0A and the official patches don't have versions like this. The are like x3_d2m_updater_280707..."
,RomanSPQR,2007-11-19T07:38Z,"specmurt- don't worry so much about it.  this patch will work with the x3 game that I put up on piratebay, so if you downloaded that, this will work with it.

don't update x3 from any other website and you should be fine with the program that's available from this site.

if you're running leopard you may have to find yourself a work around, such as installing + patching on the previous OS, then copying it to the new one. (one computer to another is the only current workaround)"
,specmurt,2007-11-19T21:49Z,Thanks mate. Will try it on Tiger. It looks like some libraries patch uses are screwed on Leopard even if you run it with Rosetta.
,toplicius,2007-11-23T19:42Z,"No need for Tiger, look for my post for game torrent..."
,theneptuneman12,2007-11-24T20:49Z,"I've been trying to download this for days, and I'm unable to get a single a seeder - still sitting at 0% - could someone seed, or even upload a leopard version here or somewhere else (it's a small file...)"
,RomanSPQR,2007-11-24T22:13Z,"I'm away from torrenting for a while, so please seed and pick up the slack if you've already downloaded this.

Thanks!"
,theneptuneman12,2007-11-24T22:21Z,"it's 304.4kbs people... I've probably uploaded the game itself to you... it'll take all of 5 minutes of your time people.

Sharing is what keeps these things alive, and sharing is how you got it yourself people."
,Thalantas,2007-11-27T19:08Z,"I'm waiting since a long time to have this file .. i've got x3 reunion on my mac but i need a product activation code, i can seed as much as you want but i need the file to do it!!

,Thalantas,2007-11-28T14:45Z,"I finally managed to download your file. I setuped X3 reunion...then i try to launch it but it asks me a first name, last name and a product code...si i cancel.
