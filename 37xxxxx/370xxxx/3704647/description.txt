:. about .:

Climb aboard an American RAH-66 Comanche, or the Russian KA-52 Hokum B, 
and prepare to experience low-level helicopter combat like never before! Sharpen
your "line of sight" tactics on over 30,000 kilometers of treacherous landscape!

War rages continuously on 3 diverse real world combat zones, where you engage
the enemy as both pilot and co-pilot/gunner. Not only do you feel the white knuckle 
tension of the realistic flight dynamics, the immersive voice control allows you to 
command your gunner and your wingman from a microphone connected to your PC.
To increase the realism, you may also play co-operatively or competitively with other
players, up to 16 on LAN or online Multiplayer.
