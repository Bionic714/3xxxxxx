,Bamimi,2007-06-04T03:36Z,is the series even over yet? golly didnt know that.
,Khono,2009-04-03T06:53Z,"The series is NOT over yet, as of my writing this.  Robert Jordan died last September (by coincidence, I happened to go to his wiki about 3 days after his death).  Some guy with a face that needs punching is finishing the last book.  "
,Khono,2009-04-03T21:07Z,"Torrent's fine.  Sucks that all the books are combined into one PDF, but the quality is decent, few errors.  It also includes the little icon pics for each chapter, though I haven't noticed any maps yet.  Those can be found on google images anyway.  "
,Khono,2009-04-03T23:33Z,Ahh; something I forgot to mention about this pdf.  It has an advertisement in it!  Ignore the first page; everyone; and don't click the spammy links!
,fatwalrus,2010-06-21T09:06Z,"Uhh 'some guy with a face that needs punching'?

Brandon Sanderson was asked to finish the series and I read his mistborn series.. he is a good writer.
Have a little faith in the guy."

Not sure how to recreate / contribute back to TPB or how to get in touch with the person that originally posted this."
,ChetanG,2011-02-06T15:16Z,"Only the first 9 books are in this torrent and you are greeting with SPAM ad links in the first page, which is easy to delete with acrobat pro.

It is hardly the complete series.

There are 13 books out now.

The format is also not the best for easy reading."
,wontpayforit,2011-04-09T00:47Z,"FYI...
I have read his books translated to Swedish.
They split the books in Sweden into two books per original because they rarely release books exceeding 800 pages here.

After hearing about ""Jordan's"" untimely passing I did some research into the facts about the ending of the series.

Jordan (is a Pseudonyme btw) dictated to his relatives and gave them the final drafts to the ending and it turned out to be so much material there will be two books to round it all of per his guidelines.

The man writing the ending is picked by Jordan and his relatives, and they intend to release one late 2010/2011 and another by 2013 to finalize Jordans massive efforts.

The book series will NOT be translated into Swedish as of book 22 (11 in the US) and the last two will also only be available in EBook form and not print copies if the information the publisher gave me still stands."
