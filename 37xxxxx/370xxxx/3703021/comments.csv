Thanks you Great Brit!"
,evilonod,2007-06-11T06:34Z,This is a really big torrent.   It will take more than a few seeders to keep it alive.  Seed for good while after you get it. 
,evilonod,2007-06-28T06:55Z,"If you do not intend to seed, then please don't download this.  Big torrents like this just don't work without seeders.   Be kind and continue to seed."

,Naivar,2008-05-17T23:43Z,"Great colllection with an extra :) The Wild South America series is not a Michael Palins' but is a beautiful series about the wildlife in South America, narrated by Fergal Keane. The opening titles show ""Andes to Amazon "" as the series title. Good one!"

,jsjoholm,2008-07-18T06:28Z,Great package of Michael Palin travel documentaries - but I do believe its worth pointing out that his latest 'New Europe' is NOT included. 
,bluefrog1979,2008-08-10T17:53Z,"i salute you evilonod...you're the sort of person who is that good, he wears his pants on the outside!

,carrot27,2008-08-21T11:16Z,"Hello, I started downloading and seeding this fantastic torrent. Have always been a fan of Palin at BBC. 
But I have one problem: I downloaded episode 1 of ""Pole to Pole"", after completing I tested if it was working, but can't play it. I already tried several mediaplayers, codecs, even converters, but nothing works! Although I'm not mr. Layman when it comes to digital video's, but this is a really hard one.
PLEASE HELP!"

That's fair is it not?

[T],kimeesteres,2010-08-27T11:02Z,"An outstanding torrent! Uploader evilonod did a splendid job organizing all the files, and it downloaded without a hitch. It took me 5 days to download all 31GiB, but it's worth it. I'll be seeded to 1.0 later today, which -every- downloader should do for -every- torrent.
Thank you to evilonod, wherever you are, from kimeesteres in the Netherlands."
,copylegal,2011-01-09T07:05Z,WOW......THIS IS WORTH MY UP LOAD POWER

Tanks to the uploader and all seeders."
