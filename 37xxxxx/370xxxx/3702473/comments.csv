,the_noc_list,2007-09-13T23:36Z,"I've seen it around, you might try torrent-fnder.com.  The problem is, this won't work anyway with the latest Intel mac update.  Pisses me off.  I was just getting into it..."

Which of the 3 tracker groups will connect me so I can get this?  A veteran of the first 4 Ultima games, I'm a fan of the old-school Ultima series going back to the 1980s, and I'd love to get this 2005 remake!  "
