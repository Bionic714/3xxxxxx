And if you have Connections3 I would be thrilled! ;)"
,stavih,2007-06-11T13:41Z,"I'm dumbfounded.  I've had the torrent queued as a seed for days, but it never went active.  So now I've force-queued it and you should be able to download.  Lemme check, I might have CONN1 available.  I didn't think CONN3 was as interesting so I didn't transcode it.  You REALLY want it?

I think James Burke's work is the most important (work) ever produced for television.  It's almost impossible to find and I feel very strongly that it be preserved and made available to the public.  It cannot be allowed to disappear from human knowledge simply because it disappears from dvd catalogs."

I really like this guy J Burke. "

Can somebody put up Conn1 please?
Thanks
