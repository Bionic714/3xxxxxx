,parca,2007-09-26T19:36Z,It doesn't join files with different kbps in audio. Anyone know of one that does? Example - try and join Live.Free.Or.Die.Hard.PROPER.R5.LINE.XViD-ViSUAL
,bwmcmaste,2008-01-05T05:56Z,"This program works perfectly, and it is probably the best video joining program I've used to date.

It's really simple (probably too simple for some of the ""pros"" out there), and it will merge three big porn -er... I mean ""video"" clips in less than a minute."
