,Xzyx987X,2008-06-17T21:14Z,"Hey, would you mind telling me where you got ahold of the japanese WMV9 raws? I don't care about english audio or subs, and I'd like to have a complete collection of the WMV9 files since they are higher quality."

,NipponJeikobu,2010-08-28T08:00Z,"Is the tracker down? I'm not able to download it and get a ""tracker returned a 4xx message"". Please fix it if you can so I can download."
,Epitaph44,2011-02-26T18:42Z,Not all of the episodes have eng subs. Only the first one and some after the 30th episode.
,NAME3456,2011-06-15T14:16Z,Nice torrent.  I was looking for good raws.  Subs don't matter to me since I know what's going on and I'd prefer it without them anyway.
