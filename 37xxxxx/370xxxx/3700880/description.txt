Series following Paul Merton as he travels through China. Paul arrives in Beijing, the start of his own oriental \'Grand Tour\'. He tastes local cuisine at a \'speciality\' restaurant, visits Tiananmen Square, and encounters a peasant who builds robots out of other people\'s scrap. Leaving the capital, he stops by an enormous replica of a French chateau, and takes a tour around one of China\'s last truly communist communes.
