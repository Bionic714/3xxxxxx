,cat_hat,2008-05-07T17:49Z,"Deadbolt Albums = Shrunken Head, Tiki Man, Tijauna Hit Squad, 
zulz Death Mask, Voodoo Trucker, Hobo Babylon, and Haight Street 
Hippie Massacre(Best Of)

There are some problems with some of the mp3's...
*on Srunken Head, track 03 is basically missing.
*on Tiki Man, the first five songs don't play properly. 
*on Voodoo Trucker, the first 3 tracks don't work properly.

BUT...there are repeats of some of those songs on the
(Best Of)Haight Street Hippie Massacre...

Anyhoo...these are very cool & rare albums. THANKS! Rock-a-bob....... >

,LeeEtta,2009-01-17T19:28Z,Thanks.  Some day I'll swing where the lil' birdies sing.
,NephilimNexus,2009-10-10T11:43Z,"Tried downloading twice and both time the entire ""Voodoo Trucker"" came out sounding like a skipping CD.  All other albums sound fine.  Anyone else run into this?"
,Tankfromdeadbolt,2011-04-14T07:48Z,Cool Yeah!
