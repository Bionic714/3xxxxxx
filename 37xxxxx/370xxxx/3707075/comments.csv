,The Living Homer,2008-02-03T04:15Z,Moving extremely slow for this many seeders.
,lichtensteiner,2008-02-07T21:40Z,"sorry but please explain: what does C4103 mean when he mentions that this torrent is flagged? what does this have to do with the fact that ""its too slow for so many seeders"" (the living homer)"
,TheSpaceGhost,2008-02-14T01:53Z,This torrent is flagged as in NBC's digital copyright infringement lawyers  (yes I know its aired on Fox) are cracking down on torrents right now.  I have received cease and desist orders from my ISP on seeding this and other torrents relating to House MD.  Users beware.
,Pappamicke,2008-03-24T10:49Z,"400 ner 800 upp.. sämst

vad betyder flaggad?? thx 4 ul"
,andyness,2008-03-24T12:15Z,"C4103 is just joking around, that son of a bitch.

Anyways, how to seed? You just leave your bittorrentclient on and you can see, after it has come to 100 %, it is still uploading. Then you are seeding.

But don't seed many files at once if you haven't got a hell of a broad broadband. Seed only about 1-2 torrents at one time. If one of them stop, which means 1) nobody is downloading 2) they are downloading from others. If thats the case, stop the torrent and start an other one. That way you are using your bandwidth ultimately.

And seed AT LEAST 1-2 ratio. I would suggest, if you have your computer on at night, around 5-10. That's what I do, and it's lovely to see like ""uploaded: 24 GB - downloaded: 699 MB"", isn't it?"
,antheasuicide,2008-04-07T17:05Z,Why wont my bittorrent find any seeders? Damnit! 
,Aryonas,2008-04-12T19:39Z,How fucked up is piratebay?? It says 291 seeders and 52 leechers. this should be flying. it's downloading for shit speeds like 19kb/s......ffs....utorrent says theres 2400 peers and 280 seeds.....how FUCKED UP can this site possibly be. I'm sick of the god damn cock sucking FUCKING seeders/leechers shit being so fucking messed up

,metallica4ever,2008-05-15T16:36Z,Thanks! Exelent torrent =)^^^^
,lhlavine,2008-06-01T04:30Z,PLEASE SEED
,cannabisleaf,2008-08-20T11:26Z,"to aryonus= the seed ratio is not really messed up. say if someone only downloads half the season and seeds what he has? hes labled as a leecher but is not downloading anything.
 beyond that this is a great show and good quality rips"

,fabk,2008-10-02T17:52Z,Could someone please fucking seed?!
,AbsolutZero,2008-10-21T02:18Z,"Aryonas you have to remember something man, you're getting a 50+ dollar product for FREE. You shouldn't be spamming comments with how the seeds and leeches are messed up. There's a lot of seeders and leechers here...you'll get it eventually. Relax"
,ScarySquirrel,2008-10-22T03:18Z,"I downloaded this season with the Transmission Bittorrent client.
It played well, but with some skipping on Ubuntu 7.10 Hardy with the xine codec set. It had no skipping on Windows.
Neither the premise or storyline require suspension of disbelief.  Still, it's interesting. "
,Googolplexian,2008-11-10T22:15Z,"Plz, seed. Everyone stuck at 87%.. "
,Googolplexian,2008-11-10T22:27Z,"Sorry, wrong torrent. no need to seed :)"
,webkilla,2010-02-24T20:51Z,"i am playing this on windows vista 64 - and its very choppy

i dont see anyone else complaining over this - so i'm at a loss over why i get it. its really bad, usually half the content of each episode seems to be corrupted, making the video players (i've tried windows media player, media player classic, zplayer... its all choppy and missing the same parts)

is the torrent bad or is it me?"
,dobrafaza,2010-03-21T09:16Z,"...but not for house s03, damn it!"
,oriange,2011-08-01T07:59Z,why is it so slow????? its been 24 hours and its still 11% on 8.2 gib.
