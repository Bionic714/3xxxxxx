"A Night Under the Dam is Green Carnation's second live DVD, released under the Sublife Productions label in 2007. This live recording was made several kilometers into the Norwegian mountains, under a 30-meter-tall dam built in 1939, hence the name. The band performed its entire "Acoustic Verses" album and other material in front of an audience of more than 500. Green Carnation was supported by several guests, including the Kristiansand String Quartet, female singer Anne Marie Almedal, former keyboard-player Bernt Moen and violinist Leif A. Wiese.
