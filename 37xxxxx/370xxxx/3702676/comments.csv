,Dodel,2007-07-10T21:08Z,"Kom på att dom som har Futaba, Hitec, Multiplex eller sanwa-radio kan köpa usb-interfacet separat från mft.nu för 90kr :) Om man har Jr eller Spektrum verkar det som man måste köpa hela kalaset för 1300kr"
,MoMoLand,2007-07-14T10:35Z,"Does this sim need a special ""USB-unlocking device"" or is it just a proper connector to the RC-transmitter??"
,oteacher,2007-09-13T18:51Z,"This is the real game, but doesnt work without the original USB Dongle.
No Dongle emulator availiable yet."

,Hugocraft,2009-12-15T05:01Z,"There has to be a way to use this program without the real USB adapter.  A dongle or something.  I remember that I got fsone to work just by chaning the name of my esky transmitter in ""regedit"" to same name of the real usb transmitter then it worked!!!  I have the esky one plugged in and it doesn't detect.  But I'm using the esky transmitter with a dongle.exe for realflight 4.5 and it works great."
,reggiereggie,2011-01-17T13:49Z,"I can now confirm that the emulator works, had to plug in an old joystick for it to work and fool phoenix, but plugged my futaba controller in aswell and I can use that :) Currently running version 3m, just downloading all the helicopters as i type.

,Xargon321,2011-02-01T11:38Z,I can Verify That Reggie is correct the Dongle emulator that he linked to works get the 0.3 ver its in English. and this works with the latest version of the program 3.0p
,jfchester69,2011-02-09T20:07Z,"Where can I get the latest version of the program Phoenix 3.0p???

By the way, emulator works great.  Just need to make sure you copy it in the same folder where the Phoenixrc.exe file is."
,Xargon321,2011-02-22T04:40Z,You go to the phoenix rc website and download the update for it. all the anti piracy stuff is in the cable so you dont need anything special to update the program
,Stompjrkz400,2011-02-23T04:11Z,"so is this emulator  for use with a universal usb doggle, or can i just use a mono  cord into my mic jack like i do with my other sims? anyone?"
,chrisschut,2011-02-24T15:22Z,can you only use the phoenix rc emulator software or do you actually need the dongle to use the software . 
,Xargon321,2011-03-16T04:37Z,i think as long as you use the emulator you can use any joystick attached to your computer.
,mar31416,2011-04-09T11:03Z,Does  this and the emulator work in Windows 7?
,MB300TD,2011-04-12T00:21Z,"I tried emulator listed, but did not work with my dummy-radio that came with real flight. Do i need to buy the USB RC 9in1 thing to get it work? I have tried several sollutions, but allways get message on screen telling me to connect my USB interface."
,kiwi_xboxer,2011-07-07T07:09Z,"Awesome.... this works great ... you can download the latest V3 Patch off the Pheonix Sim site.... the Emulator works Great .... and works with 2K, XP, VISTA, WIN 7 :)
Works online too!!!! have had many hours online hosting training and flying sessions!

You must load the sim emulator to the program directory and then run the emulator and select run Phoenix! But it does work ...."
,kiwi_xboxer,2011-07-07T09:46Z,OH ... One thing I did notice ..... only version EMU 0.3 works..... (with my Dynam Controller anyway). I have some challenges setting up this time .... (just rebuilt my PC last night and lost all data) .... but found deleting the joystick.txt file and then set up the emulator again ... it worked fine! - Persevere and you shall come out with the most awesome sim in the world .... especially when you upgrade to V3 through the main website! - SEEED peoples .... SEED!

,ubamba,2011-12-08T02:34Z,"Yes, this works on Windows 7 64 bit

Install & update instructions for Win7_64
1. Install Program
2. Load the emulator (i'm using v3 downloaded from that dudes skydrive...check earlier in the comments section) and .dll file into the Phoenix directory.  Use the launcher to launch Phoenix.
3. Don't set up controller until you have updated to latest version as the controller profile file changes format from v2 to v3 so it is not possible to import.  You will have to do the whole setup again after upgrading.

*Note on update problems
To install problem updates (sometimes the update program installer hangs/crashes) do the following:

1. Put Update files (.phx files) into ""C:\Users\[your_username]\Documents\PhoenixRC\Downloaded updates"".  Updates can be downloaded from http://www.phoenix-simv3.com/downloads.asp
2. Then execute the file phoenixupdateinstaller.exe in the Program directory
3. Select yes to install updates manually
4. Sometimes the installer crashes or hangs so you should then break the updates into smaller groups and do them one by one.  E.g. say you have 200 update files about 400mb in size.  Copy 50 files at a time to the ""C:\Users\[your_username]\Documents\PhoenixRC\Downloaded updates"" folder and run the manual update process.  Chances are one of the updates is causing it to hang, but if you try to install it a couple of times it should work...just crappy coding by Phoenix devs."

,pornznz,2012-04-29T10:44Z,"Ok got it working using esky 4 channel transmitter and dongle and spectrum dx6i 

1) mount phoenix.nrg with daemon tools or 120% acid and install to desired directory.
2)download the v3.0 update and install. (it will take some time) http://www.phoenix-sim-files.com/files/updates/phoenixRC_ANY_30m_update.exe
3)download this Emulator crack and extract all contents into the games directory (eg c:/program files/phoenixrc . http://cid-4c3ac33f59323146.office.live.com/browse.aspx/.Public then open folder ""Phoenix flight sim"" then click phoenixRC_emu_v0_3
4) run the launcher (emulator crack) and follow calibration instructions, once finished you shall be prompted with updates, install updates as they are downloaded, eventually it will install phoenix to v4. The Crack launcher will still work.

enjoy v4
