Since the beginning of the new millenium, "Mod Ros" 
has been creating the aggresive sounds of an energetic 
mixture of Riotcore and Mash Up remixes. 

Consisting of mostly Breakcore and elements of Jungle, 
the fast paste rhythms and distorted sounds and 
basslines makes up the music of Mod Ros. The Mash Up 
Remixes came from a wish to destroy the sounds of the
mindless POP music.

Made as themes to autonomous uprising and liberated 
moments from a world of control, the political edge is 
hard to miss.
