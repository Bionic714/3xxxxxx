,Incantos,2007-06-25T09:16Z,Is anyone out there still seeding this? Its the most recent season and didn't even end that long ago so I figured it would still have some seeders. I have been stuck at 99% for around 4 days now. If anyone has this completed please seed for me.
,whitetara,2007-06-29T03:17Z,if you have just episode 22 and 23 I would greatly appreciate it if you could download them...thanks

,Pheanix,2007-08-08T13:10Z,krankumar  this is not funny anymore. seed. still stuck at 99.9%. its not nice to upload something and not seed it.
,bjaerk,2007-08-16T23:03Z,"I'm also stuck at 99,9%... Should think that someone of the 9 seeders I have on my tracker could finalize the last ,1%!!!

I have a shitty out-speed from my ISP, but I'm willing to seed this so people can have this series."
,preacherraven,2007-08-21T03:15Z,Great to find whole season three... I'm gonna keep seedeing for a while after I get it down... :)
,Pheanix,2007-08-22T23:26Z,preacherraven thats nice. but i guess u will never get it down. i have been downloading this one for over 3 weeks now. and i have been stuck on 99.9% for over 2 weeks. it looks like no one will get all the 100% :(
,preacherraven,2007-08-23T15:10Z,*Pheanix* I'm thinkin' of dropping this torrent and download episode 8 & 10 by them selves. It seams kind a strange to upload a torrent and not lettin' anyone get more than 99.9%. And so far I've downloaded 8.68 gb of 8.53 gb. Is there someone of theese 1355 peps that downloaded this torrent that got the whole thing?
,Bo Bandy,2007-08-25T18:08Z,"i think I'm seeding the whole thing so if those at 99.9% finish up quickly, mention it so I know I did it right. :)"
,Bo Bandy,2007-08-25T18:24Z,...and if no one's getting it I could reseed the whole thing in a new torrent if there was interest.
,Bo Bandy,2007-08-25T18:37Z,"Okay, yeah, that ain't workin'.  I'll make a new torrent if someone says ""make a new torrent."""
,Iscariot1357,2007-08-27T19:17Z,"Someone please seed this torrent, it's so annoying being stuck on 99.9% like this!!! Pleeeeeeeeease, seeding the torrent on for 10 minutes would fix this entire problem"
,BimBom,2007-09-02T19:14Z,"What the hell is the matter with these videos? My computer freezes when i try to play them but GSpot says everything's are OK, so i have all the codecs. What could it be?"

,jekodama,2007-09-07T17:15Z,"I'm stuck at 99.9 since Saturday September 1st! Can anyone please seed? My status panes says that there are no seeds in the swarm! Please, help!"
,jekodama,2007-09-07T17:19Z,"I only need 8Mbs, specifically for chapter 8 and chapter 10. Is there a gracious soul that can help me with that?"
