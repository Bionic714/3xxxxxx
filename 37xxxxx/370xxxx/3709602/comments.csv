,dddddd,2007-07-15T19:21Z,"Anyone played this successfully with wther VLC or Mplayer ? My Mplayer claims it canÂ´t find either a video, nor audio stream. VLC manages to find the DTS audio track but no video.
Help would be appreciated."

First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.


Install those and report back!
