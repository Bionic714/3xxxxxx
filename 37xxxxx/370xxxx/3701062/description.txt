Formed in 1999 in the Geneva suburbs by Lead singer Seb and drummer Igor, the band will later find its final identity with the arrival of guitar palyers Gr3g and Matt, coming all the way from the nice french neighbourood... The band already have 2 EP and 1 LP released on independant swiss label such as Hannibal's Records. The latest one called "take a breath", released in january 2004 have led the band to tour all around Switzerland and France as well to promote and have lots of fun... The band has toured with many famous names of the international rock scene such as Bad Religion, Hot water Music, The Toy Dolls and other french acts like Dolly or Superbus... Hateful Monday's newest album "The last March of the Ignorant" is out now (GPS records->switzerland, france; Unnatractive records->Japan)!
