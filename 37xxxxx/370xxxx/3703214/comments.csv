Thanks for these rare files :-) 
PLEASE KEEP ON SEEDING.
Let this torrent live for a while - since the upload is slow one needs time to let it get finished."
,murphyXX,2007-08-02T23:28Z,"Please - i have waited for this since the days of Napster where there were just a few Pearls before Swines tunes.
This is very rare, -  Please seed - i hope this will work! "
,murphyXX,2007-08-12T21:10Z,Pretty useless - downloaded 80kb in 3 days.
,murphyXX,2007-12-09T14:27Z,"Correction to my older comment.
This torrent works - fair play to the uploader."
,unclefokka,2007-12-09T23:29Z,Superb! Thanks very much!
,bulbman,2008-05-07T00:20Z,But don't go to the URL that he posts for FTP connection info - it's a malware site.
,pschnob,2008-12-06T22:04Z,"it's not malware, the webpages use javascript so it takes a moment to load."
