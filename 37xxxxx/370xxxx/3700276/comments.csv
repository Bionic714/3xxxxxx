,dreamer63,2007-05-30T13:04Z,Works great! thx man
,johanpim,2007-05-30T21:20Z,"hello 
i cant get it work. i only see a picture of EA Games when i run the game. can someone help me please?"
,Phoenix.5052,2007-06-02T14:14Z,"Remove the game, 
reboot the system, 
reinstall the game and try again.
On some systems it wont run the first time, never could figure out why.
Must be one of those westwood bugs ;-)
Or could just be in the cracked exe :-(

Should also always run it in windows 98 mode;
goto properties of the game's shortcut and on compatibility tab you can select win98/me.

cheers."
,Phoenix.5052,2007-06-02T14:17Z,"ps.
There might be a problem with trying to run red alert (without yuris revenge)...
It worked just fine when this pack was created.
However on newer systems or with todays drivers or something it doesnt seem to work for most people.

Could also be a cracked exe problem,
but you will have to test that yourself since I never play without the yuri expansion."
,cosanostra_money,2007-06-03T15:45Z,when the lan game has loaded up it minimizes and come up with a message that thier has been an internal error and i should go to thier website waht should i do?
,Corpheus,2007-06-04T04:58Z,"I'm also having a problem. I try and run the thing first time, haven't even entered the code, and it says that it's 'encountered a problem and needs to close'. I've owned RA2 before and played it on XP, but since this appears to not be working, and suggestions?"
,Phoenix.5052,2007-06-04T20:42Z,"What do you mean, you havent even entered the code?!?!
After the setup wizard has completed installing the files, a popup will appear. This handy little tool will create a new key for you and adds it to the registry and woldata. So NO need to type anything! ;-)
If you did not press OK on this tool, the key does not exist and the game wont work i asume.

But again, if you get an internal error you need to reinstall the game.
I never could find out why in some rare cases this happens. Could be that something went wrong during installation.
But after reinstalling the game or even 2 or 3 times, it will work!"
,Biomega,2007-06-09T04:22Z,"Got it working in Vista, nice."
,wranzzon,2007-06-10T16:29Z,"i cant get it to work, when i shall start the game it says ""***FATAL***String manager failed to initilaized properly"" what does that mean, please help me"
,Not_1,2007-07-04T20:50Z,"Same problem as some others, once a map has loaded up the a little popup appears and says ""Red Alert 2 has encountered an internal error and has to be shut down, blah, blah, blah"". Any idea?"
,wongfuckinperson,2007-07-11T05:16Z,"Same problem as some others, once a map has loaded up the a little popup appears and says ""Red Alert 2 has encountered an internal error and has to be shut down, blah, blah, blah"". Any idea?

i get that same problem"
,Avegard,2007-07-13T22:24Z,"Ååh, jag trodde verkligen att den skulle fungera till slut... det blir till att köpa spelen på nytt igen =("
,moppers,2007-07-27T03:25Z,"Initially, I got the ""internal error"" thingy...uninstalled, rebooted 3 times and same thing.  Turned off anti-virus, anti spyware...basically  all non-critical processes and on the fourth try, presto!  works great.  Turned everything back on and it still works."
,Umbra366,2007-07-30T07:27Z,"For those experiencing the ""Internal Error"" problem, there is a solution.

What I did was uninstall the program and reinstall it, this time choosing the ""Custom"" installation option. Check the first two boxes, hit next and choose the 800x600 option. Then, choose the installation location to be ""C:\Westwood"" (without quotes). This doesn't effect the game play, but is recommend since that is the default installation for the legit version and all patches/files will, by default, link there.

If your game is running slow, try stopping your anti-virus program (activating it once you're done playing). You can also disable it while you're installing the program, like the above user said."
,makingcookies,2007-08-12T13:54Z,there is no videos and no music.
,Attif12,2007-08-12T15:47Z,"Hi! I would first like to thank you for a truley great torrent but I have a slight problem..

I run Windows XP Professional and I dont seem to have any IPX, so LAN-play is out of the question. How can this be fixed?"
,Fenrir[HuN],2007-08-14T10:55Z,I've downloaded the music of the game. Where should I put the folder and how to name it?
,Attif12,2007-08-16T02:03Z,"By the way, I found out how but sadly it did not work on Vista so my brother could not play it on lan..


The morale of this story is: VISTA SUCKS ASS. "
,Stader,2007-08-17T13:00Z,"Step 1: Find the RA2.exe/RA2MD.exe in the games' folders.

Step 2: Right click on either one, and select properties. Navigate to the security tab, and give ""Users"" full permission by clicking edit and then clicking the full control box under allow.

Step 3: Click the compatability tab, and click the box by ""Run this program as an administrator"" under the ""Privelege Level"" area.

Step 4: Run the game and enjoy! I hope this has helped you out somehow. "

All of a sudden during game play on the machine I installed it to, the sound crashed and had to un-install and Ive had no luck getting it to work again. Now I know why, becuase i tried to un-install for the 5th time and it complains about an iun6002.exe error and refuses to un-install!!! I do a google search and find that this is a virus/spyware. IUN6002.EXE is a desktop surveillance personal spyware!! Google it and you will see...shithead"

i got yuri's revenge to work but only theres no music and movies,but it doesnt give you any error messages

what I did is:

Step 1: download command & conquer - red alert 2 (full game).exe from isohunt.com and download this torrent aswell.

Step 2: install this torrent (Command & Conquer Red Alert 2, Yuri's Revenge {Proper Bundle,).

Step 3: Install the other torrent (command & conquer - red alert 2 (full game).exe),to the same directory as yuri's revenge.It should work but with no music and movies :(.

dont worry this torrent is cool!

,Phoenix.5052,2008-03-15T12:19Z,"Seems more people have problems running this then I even experienced.
I installed this game on multiple PCs on a LAN-party and had no problems what so ever.
Could be something with this torrent thing... dont know.

1. IF YOUR DOWNLOADS COMPLETES AND YOU CANT RUN IT:
RENAME THE FILE TO INCLUDE THE EXTENTION .EXE
IT IS SOMEHOW RENAMED SOMETIMES.

2. IF YOU CANT ENTER LAN...
INSTALL THE BLOODY IPX/SPX PROTOCOL ON YOUR NETWORK ADAPTER PROPERTIES.
IPX IS NOT SUPPORTED IN VISTA AND WILL PROBABLY NEVER BE EITHER!

3. GAME ERRORS ARE A MISTERY TO ME.
ALOT OF USERS NEVER HAVE ANY PROBLEMS.
USE THE CUSTOM INSTALL... IT MIGHT HELP.
OR REINSTALL THE GAME WITHOUT REMOVING IT FIRST... MIGHT HELP TOO.
I ALWAYS GET IT RUNNING AFTER AN HOUR OR SO ;)

4. PLEASE STOP POSTING ABOUT THE MUSIC, MOVIES OR MISSIONS.
THIS PACK WAS MADE FOR LAN PLAY ONLY (YURIS REVENGE).
IF YOU WANT THE MUSIC JUST OVERWRITE THE FILES FROM THE INSTALL WITH THE ORIGINAL FILES FROM THE CD.

5. NEVER HAD ANY SCANNER TELLING ME THERE IS A VIRUS OR TROJAN IN THIS...
SO SCREW THE PEOPLE WHO SAY OTHERWISE ;)

AND BEFORE YOU ASK OR COMPLAIN...
READ THE BLOODY TORRENT DESCRIPTION!
:P

-After you install it, restart the computer.
-Load the RA2MD.exe file, NOT the desktop one
-Disable anti-virus"

,mangunga,2008-07-14T16:02Z,Sorry for asking about the music and gameplay movies but is there any place where we can download those files? If anyone know plz tell me ..
,dpgbr,2008-07-17T00:37Z,"OK. I'VE FIGURE IT OUT!!!

For those of you that are having problem with the game crashing and asking to visit stupid web site, follow these instructions:

If the game is opening, go to Options screen and select a game screen resolution. That's it!!

If the game is not opening, edit the file RA2.INI (RA2MD.INI for Yuri's) on the game folder, search for the [Video] section and set the resolution. It should look like this:

[Video]
ScreenWidth=800
ScreenHeight=600
StretchMovies=no

Now, for the people complaining about not being able to enter the Network screen, just install the ""NWLink IPX"" protocol.

I suggest following Hamachi setup inscructions, as they show how to play the game using UDP instead of the sucky IPX protocol, works for Local Net or over the Internet.

http://logmeinwiki.com/wiki/Hamachi:Red_Alert_2

Hope I've helped, because this game might be old but still great game play!"

2) You can play LAN over internet using Hamachi (google it)
3) Use this patch: http://www.understorm.net/cnc/lan/ts_ra2.php for playing over network on vista
4) To play on vista, set the compatability of ra2.exe to 2000 or XP, and right click ra2.exe and click Run as Administrator"
