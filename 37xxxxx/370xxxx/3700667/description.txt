- Release Notes
* 592x336 vs 624x352 from analog or dsr source
really makes no difference.
* this is lossless motion, 29.97fps is lossy
motion when compared to the tv broadcast.
yes, DSR rips are a little better quality, but
a lot less motion since they are just deinterlaced
choice it yours.
* Suggested player: VLC videolan.org
WMP is junk and will probably go out of sync
* Enjoy
