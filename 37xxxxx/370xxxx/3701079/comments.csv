and you could probably put these on your gameboy if you had a spare cartridge and an EEPROM burner and some sort of burning software, but why bother?  Just play em on your computer."
,oPiN37,2008-05-06T15:59Z,"Thank you!! I´ve been looking for Golden Sun for about two years, and I couldn´t find it... I asked someone who worked at a gameshop, and he said that it´s impossible to get it - the only way is to order it from England, and that that would cost about 400-500 kr...! So thank you locohygynx! you´re a lifesavier!! =)"
,oPiN37,2008-05-10T02:10Z,"Okey, MAYOR PROBLEM!! First of all, I was playing Golden Sun I - the best game in that list - when all of a sudden, everything vanished! A couple of days ago, I was playing the game, I was at level 26, was on Crossbone Island and I  had allmost every djinni exept the one that´s down there, and trying to get some exp. points.. At this ponit, I had spent 15 hours, getting were I was. And out of the blue, PUFF!!! My saved game was gone! I was back at Atmiller Cave, 5 hours ago! 

So I have to ask all of you who´s donwloaded, and played these games - especuially Golden Sun I - and tell me if you´ve had any problem with the game... And by the way, yesterday something changed again... I don´t know what, but all of a sudden, my game speed was up at 200-370 %! I was lucky if I just a few days ago, got as high as 150 %! Help! I want to play these games, but I can´t, since it´s going to fast...!!!"

,Hprf,2008-11-17T01:13Z,"So, I mainly downloaded this torrent due to the Pokemon Chaos Black & Fire Red roms, but as I tried to save it, I got an error saying I needed to change the backup memory in order to save the game, .. If you know any way to loop around this matter or solve it, then please reply here or add my msn. - Runn250@hotmail.com

Thank you in advance."
