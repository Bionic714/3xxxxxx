[T],kimeesteres,2010-03-18T23:17Z,"I'm seeding from the Netherlands, but with an extremely slow download rate due to some kind of system problem. If you really want this, you'll have to be very patient...

The Nine Inch Nails - Purest Feeling  (Remastered) - 1988 Demo [FLAC] torrent is also running slow.

Seeders, please! :)"
[T],kimeesteres,2010-03-24T19:10Z,"F*ck it! I got tired of the drip-drip-drip speed of this torrent, so I created one of my own. Just click on my user name - kimeesteres - and that will take you to my list, where you can find the NEW and FAST torrent of PUREST FEELING (Remastered - FLAC).

Dank u uit Nederland, van kimeesteres!"
