,OggWorld,2007-11-13T22:41Z,Please reseed. :/
,gonXed,2008-02-03T13:32Z,Pfft... not even real lossless. That is unless they saved it as a lossy format back at the recordings :(
,sjørøver-ole,2008-10-27T07:53Z,"Well, late response: but: this is real lossless. Blame recording-studios for crappy sound-quality. Though the -vinyl- sounds perfect. Anyway, this album is just as good as the original CD."
,crazyjosyphillis,2008-12-13T11:43Z,did you just rip this off the CD???
,sjørøver-ole,2009-12-01T22:52Z,yes
