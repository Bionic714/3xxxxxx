This a rip of the DEVO: LIVE 1996 convert released in 2004.  The DVD contains 3 views in 4:3 format which I placed together in a 16:9 format.  I really like seeing all the views at once so I thought others would too.  I like it so much I wish all concerts would be released with such a combined view. Enjoy.

If you really like the concert please buy the DVD to support the artist.
