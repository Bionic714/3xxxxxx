:. About .:

The -Utopia-City- game will amaze your imagination and let
you feel that everything going on is absolutely real.
 
Don't miss it!!!

The game is set in the virtual city, Utopia. This is a fictional place,
but much of the information you explore is almost real and amazes
by its originality. Utopia-City is inhabited by human beings, for whom
this virtual world has become a drug, they cannot give up. 

They even do not understand that there is no way back for them. Humans
live in a virtual paradise and do not surmise the danger represented by this
unreal world to all of them. By the way, there are also security guards and 
destructors in Utopia-City. 

Their task is to defend UtopiaCity from external intrusion and support life in it.
Utopia seems to be an animate organism. At first it is quite loyal to a player
however, if he shows aggression Utopia does its best to try to defend its world.

A player gets into the City in order to rescue mankind captured by a Mastermind 
and lost in a digital world. 

The problem is that the Utopia-City inhabitants do not want to leave 
Utopia and soever try to hinder their own rescue.
