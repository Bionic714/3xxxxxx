,bdgr,2007-06-02T00:12Z,"Great one Shankly - I always wait for your monthly offerings and am never disappointed by them.

You rock!"
[T],Shanklys Love Child,2007-06-02T01:43Z,"Thanks for the appreciation :)

I've been listening to these all day myself and I think they're the best ones of the year so far :)"
,bluegamba,2007-06-02T04:06Z,"Perfect as always, Shankly. Recently my computer crashed and I lost 150 Gb of music. Lucky I had already burned  your ""Best"" on cd! Have I missed Andrew Bird and Jesse Malin in your lists or has my brain crashed as well? Anyway, thanks to you I am up to date again.

Best regards, Bluegamba"
,NocturnalMe,2007-06-04T06:09Z,"I've been picking these mixes up for some time now, and they're always really impressive. But curiousity has overwhelmed me: who is Shankly? 

Is he/she/it only a seeder with excellent taste? Or is Shankly someone I should have heard of from another context? 

I need to know."
,satch,2007-06-04T18:22Z,This is indeed a welcome discovery on the bay! I think I'll become a regular to this series... Thanks a lot!
[T],Shanklys Love Child,2007-06-06T10:31Z,"Satch - search for ""Shankly"" to find the other torrents. 

The ""mysterious"" one..."
