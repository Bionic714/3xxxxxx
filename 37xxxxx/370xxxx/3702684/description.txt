     Sweden's ALL ENDS, the band that was initially a
     project formed by IN FLAMES members Bjorn Gelotte
     and Jesper Stromblad, but since became the band
     featuring Gelotte's sister Emma (vocals), Tinna
     Karlsdotter (vocals), Fredrik Johansson (DIMENSION
     ZERO, In Flames - guitars), Peter Mårdklint
     (EMBRACED, TENEBRE - guitars) and Joseph Skansås
     (drums)

     ccording to the band's official bio, "ALL ENDS,
     founded in 2003 in Gothenburg, Sweden, feature a
     sound housing somewhere between rock and metal that
     lives first and foremost through the fascinating
     voices of the two front-ladies, Tinna Karlsdotter
     and Emma Gelotte. It is this two-pronged female
     approach that distinguishes these Swedes from the
     rest of the crowd and gives them their own unique
     sound. The debut EP 'Wasting Life' doesn?t sound
     like NIGHTWISH or WITHIN TEMPTATION or
     EVANESCENCE?on the contrary, it sounds like nothing
     other than ALL ENDS!

     "And if the name 'Gelotte' sounds familiar, then it
     should, because IN FLAMES guitarist Björn Gelotte
     is the brother of singer Emma. Björn and his
     bandmate Jesper Strömblad are highly creative
     songwriters with a huge musical spectrum, and the
     inspiration for ALL ENDS. Jesper and Björn's role
     with ALL ENDS is solely a creative involvement
     behind the scenes.

     "The fact that ALL ENDS is made up of five top
     musicians of their genre is evident in the
     magnificent 'Alone', which skillfully treads the
     line between metallic wrecking ball and pop anthem.
     And the title track, 'Wasting Life', is also
     equally characterized by the simultaneously
     powerfully and melodic guitar work that is simply
     irresistible in combination with the sleek grooves
     and whale-sized hooks."

     ALL ENDS will take part in the Eartshaker Roadshock
     Tour beginning late April. Also scheduled to appear
     on the bill are FINNTROLL, AFTER FOREVER, TAROT,
     DIE APOKALYPTISCHEN REITER and MACHINE MEN
