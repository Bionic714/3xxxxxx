My Secret Life was first published between 1888-1894 in 11 volumes in Amsterdam by the Belgian-born bookseller/publisher Auguste Brancart. For the next 100 years, it remained banned and considered obscene and pornographic.

The British Library has a set that it believes was published in about 1880, but "The imprint is probably false; printed in Belgium?".

No-one really knows the true identity of "Walter". But biographer Ian Gibson claims it is the pen name of one Henry Spencer Ashbee, pictured left.

Only 20-25 sets of My Secret Life were originally printed, and sold at Â£60 per set, an enormous sum for the times, equivalent to over Â£4000 ($6000) at today's prices.
