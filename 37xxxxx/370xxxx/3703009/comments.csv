,simps0n,2007-06-02T14:09Z,"Actually, Windows XP also needs to be activated."
,antimicrochip,2007-06-02T18:48Z,"If you enter a VLK key in Windows XP, you don't need to activate."
,simps0n,2007-06-02T19:49Z,"Ah well, this ain't XP, this is Vista. :P"
,pyroman131,2007-06-04T05:07Z,We really really need some people to seed this. I'm at 46% downloaded and I can't finish it unless we have seeders. Please seed!
,simps0n,2007-06-04T17:48Z,"I know, sorry for that, but my connection was cut off for 1 day, so im back to seed now. ;)"
,GEO16,2007-06-04T21:46Z,Is this the 64Bit Version?
,simps0n,2007-06-04T23:09Z,It's 32-bit.
,Ubehage,2007-06-04T23:31Z,"Windows XP also needs activation. But most versions has been cracked, so activation is not needed.

In Vista, activation has been built-in so tight into the system, that it is very difficult to crack..
But everything can be cracked, eventually :)


The good thing about Vista is, that WGA has been disabled...
""If not legal, then not activated. If not activated, you cannot update"", seems to be M$'s thoughts.. :)"
,pyroman131,2007-06-05T04:52Z,"Alright, I have one last comment/question and then I'm done:

Is this a 32-bit beta version of Windows Vista?"
,pyroman131,2007-06-05T05:11Z,"Woops, I forgot to add to my above comment:

If this is a beta version, are there any problems with using it as compared to the final version of windows vista? Is it missing stuff? etc."
,simps0n,2007-06-05T21:23Z,"It's 32-bit, and it's final, so no problems at all. ;)"
