Hello fellow pirates,

===================
WINDOWS VISTA ENG INSTALL / ACTIVATION CRACK / DUTCH LANGUAGE PACK
===================

Installation:

1. Burn the image to a DVD and install Vista WITHOUT entering a CD-Key.
2. When completed, open the activation crack and there you go; an activated version of Windows Vista.

3. (optional) Change the language by going to Control Centre -> Change display language, and install the language pack.


(it's recommended that you do not activate the Vista Updates, it may cause deletion of the activation crack)

===================

special thanks to ParadoX & ClonY for the crack
