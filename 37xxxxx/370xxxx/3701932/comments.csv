,StoffMisbrukerRobin,2007-09-23T23:38Z,"brad1669 is rigt, I got Firmware 3.71 and it does not work, I would say: dont bother download it"
,pspmovies,2007-10-01T13:10Z,"Just tested this on custom firmware 3.71 M33, works fine !!!  
Make sure you copy the whole VIDEO folder and all contained files to the ROOT of your memory card.
South park icon should appear in the Video menu, just click it to play.
Should play on standard official firmware.
No need to rename any files, new firmwares don't require names like M4V00002

To install custom firmware, to play downloaded game ISOs and homebrew, use the 3.03 downgrader or pandoras battery hack, goto  http://pspupdates.qj.net/ to find out how."

,.iso,2008-01-30T14:17Z,"it's working perfect on any psp light and slim.
with firmware 3.30+.
Just put the file under videos, unplug your psp and run the movie under the video tab in your psp. Have fun and dont forget to look at http://psp-movies.freehostia.com fore more gr8 qualety movies!"
