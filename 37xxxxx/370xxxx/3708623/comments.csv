,neogeovg,2007-09-22T04:25Z,You need to download the Real Player for play this kind of format. You can get it here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Video/Video-Players/RealPlayer.shtml

,Wild_Child84,2007-11-18T16:15Z,"if any of you happens to stop at 99,9 or something. do try like my friend did! actually I didnÂ´t think of it myself until he told me! but it works better for me by double clicking on the download file to stop it.. and then double click on it again! try it! 
It doesnÂ´t always work though, but the chance is pretty big.."

,Glitterspell,2008-05-22T11:08Z,Can someone upload this season in windows media player? Real player won't work on my computer for some reason and I really like this season it's my favorite I'd really appreciate it if someone could upload this season in avi a.k.a. windows media format...
,COM.UNIST,2008-07-04T04:11Z,"Hmm, quality is ok, some files have audio out of sync, but as a whole it's totally watchable and worth the download (unless you are a purist who just watches the ""best possible quality"")

A word though about the use of realPlayer, that has to be the most stupid mediaplayer there is, why not just use VLC. Usually works on anything, but not this, had to get the new RealPlayer. Waste of harddrive.

Still, im happy i could watch the season and got it quite fast. Thanks to the uploader."

,Al Capwn,2008-12-02T13:00Z,"Runner up for shittiest upload of 2008.  The Japanese subtitles take up 1/8th of the screen, it's in the most incompatible format available and the worst part is some of the episodes have video that is 2-3 seconds out of sync with the audio"
,Scary B,2009-04-19T22:52Z,"I have added a clean DVD rip of season 6 to PB in XviD format, it's bigger at 8GB but higher res and DD5.1 sound. I hope it is of use! And no burned in subtitles!

,MysMyers,2009-04-26T22:45Z,"This was a bull download. Seriously, the quality sucks and has subtitles. I could have watched this on project free tv if I wanted this shit. "
