plot:2001: men without jobs, in the port 
city of Vigo. Six men worked in a shipyard, 
now shuttered. They pass the time at La Naval, 
a bar opened by one of them after the yard 
closed. They face their futures in makeshift 
ways: Rico has his bar and a sharp 15-year-old 
daughter, Reina has become a watchman and a 
moralizer, Lino fills out job applications, 
Amador drinks heavily and talks of his wife's 
return; José is married to Ana, who works at 
a cannery and tires of being the breadwinner 
amidst José's emasculated moodiness; Santa, 
the group's conscience and troublemaker, 
occasionally fantasizes about Australia. 
In truth, all are joined like Siamese twins, 
adrift.
