ALL SONGS ARE mp3 FORMAT

Ive tryed to include most of floyd's early work (pre the wall).

sound quality is good, 

apart from piper at the gates of dawn   but it is easly enjoyable. (if anyone has a better quality, let me know)

ps.

upload speads are slow on this pc. so.... just wait. i wont download anything for a while.

gimmi some kind of feedback.. if this works, i have the entire collection of led zepplin.
