But it's more likely Acelick911 is a anti-pirate. Wants everything to be bought and legal. Problem is tho, I found thers more pirates than there is Anti-Pirates.
To the point where certain movie companies are actually pirates themselves.
Take for example the very first Cruel Intention,  The irony is that a developer of the final copy actually was one of the first to distribute it via the internet."
