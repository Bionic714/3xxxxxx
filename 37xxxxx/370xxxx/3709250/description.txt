Overview:	Michael, a Vietnam vet, pulls off a bank heist with his gang, which includes the bank's manager. To ensure the loyalty of everyone involved, a set of keys is made to the hiding place for the loot so it can only be opened if all the members are present.

His daughter gets hold of the key and runs for help to David, one of her father's old friends and also a Vietnam vet as well as a former comrade of Michael's.
