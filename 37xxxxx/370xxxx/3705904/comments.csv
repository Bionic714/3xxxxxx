Thanks for the constant (but slow) seed.
At this rate I will be done with this 1gb file
in 47 days.

Looking forward to commenting on it in 
October.  :-("

Ok.  I've had this completed for some time now and
seeded almost a 50:1 ratio and will not be giving my HD any more abuse. :-)

I'll leave this up for a bit more then have to let it go.   Hope you all have enjoyed it as much as I have enjoyed being a seeder.  :-)"
