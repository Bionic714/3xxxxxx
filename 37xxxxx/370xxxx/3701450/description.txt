Description: COI is a one-click installer that gives Mac Intel owners the ability to run pre- OS-X applications.  It provides a Macintosh OS-9 environment with networking, apps, and access from the OS-9 desktop to your boot volume. 

I?m assuming you have one last application on that old mac sitting on the corner that you just have to run? so here?s an easy way to run MacOS 9 on your shiny new intel mac. (of course you have licenses for all this because it?s sitting over in the corner, right?).

The installer should take care of everything so all you have to do is click Classic-On-Intel (in the OS9 folder the installer puts in your applications folder).  Tested on macbook, iMac, mac mini, and  macbook pro.
