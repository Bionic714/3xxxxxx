,gwalkabout,2007-05-31T06:59Z,"Hi, This is my first up here. Did the same routine as demonoid but am unsure if I did it right.  Can't find a how2 or nfo for the tracker (is it announce) any help if there are problems would be appreciated. (my originals are over at demonoid - if anyone wants to up here, is ok with me). "

,cultivator,2007-06-05T01:59Z,Does this really work?
,ballju,2007-06-05T06:14Z,"In saying what veloce88 said cultivator, yes it is it, its basically sheepshaver http://gwenole.beauchesne.info/projects/sheepshaver/ with a os9 rom file and os9 cd file in order to run it. It is awesome thanks gwalkabout! "
,inachu,2007-06-18T04:17Z,I just have a pc so it won't work so I won't try downloading it but there isa program out there that does run the OS9 rom on a regular intel or AMD pc.   forgot the name though.
,gwalkabout,2007-06-30T21:57Z,"Aloha,
I've put my most recent verson here at 
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3729050/
it's smaller, fixes a few internal os9 issues, zero-install, move anywhere, includes application to upgrader/change os, more (and bigger automount HDs). ... enjoy.
