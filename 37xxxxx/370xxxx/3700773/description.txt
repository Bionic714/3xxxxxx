From Kamikazerecords.de :
"Yeehaaaa! The new CD full packed with PopPunk nuggets. A must have! Earcatching bubblegum-pop-punk-rock from Germany. The Groovie Ghoulies, Queers, and The Travoltas meets The Beach Boys and the Ramones.A very weird but nevertheless well working blend.Great tunes, great lyrics, cool vocals and the icing on the cake is the madly pounding punk'n roll. The Hawaiians should be part of any good party DJ's repertoire. Their songs are forcefully driven into your auditory canal to stay. Dan Cooper (Kamikaze-labelhead) is already addicted to the Hawaiians. "A mean little rock'n roll virus turnung your musical tastes inside out" Brought to fame by supporting The Queers & raved about by the OX magazine even before their debut 'Teenagers Love' came out, these exeptional band is on their way to the punk rock charts." 

A really cool band from germany. For those who like The Beach Boys and The Ramones!
