,djangotor,2008-07-28T15:48Z,"correction, does not play on PC also."
,wuzzen,2009-01-28T06:56Z,Here's how I solved the problem: I extracted the ISO-file using winrar. Then I took dvd-files that was in the ISO-file and burned it on a dvd using nero. I think this should work. At least it works on my computer! :-)
