,icing53,2009-02-13T07:38Z,"Just finished downloading it, and I've already uploaded 42gb of this monster!!!
Works great, sound and video top notch, and I just play it in windows classic cinema.
If you're having trouble viewing this, download the K-Lite Codec pack, should work just fine. And you can also just burn this to a blue-ray disk and watch it in a blue ray player :D
Again, many great thanks to the uploader, this is a treasure to keep for sure."
