,jan-the-pirat,2007-07-15T19:00Z,"Lock My PC? is an easy in use and compact tool for quick computer locking when you leave it unattended. It shows a lock screen, disables Windows hot keys and mouse. You can lock your PC with a hotkey or from the system tray. To unlock the computer you must enter correct password only. Unlike another similar computer lock software that cannot lock Ctrl+Alt+Del on a computer running Windows XP, our Lock My PC runs own keyboard driver to block such key combinations."
,MPG187,2008-03-15T02:43Z,"Good software, I have Vista and when I unlock is switches back to Vista basic, then black screens and
then finally goes back to Vista Aero, so unlocking blinks the screen and goes to Vista basic then back, the reason why I lock my machine is to go back to my stuff fast! (And to keep torrens and processes going) I used to use another software but I had to always uninstall, reinstall and enter the key, I dont think it knew I was using a crack since I didnt have internet then (but I did have a network with the machines using the same key...)

Also back then (before Vista) I had 98 and couldnt lock, also it was better than XPs lock since I could black the screen and make it look like the PC was off! "
