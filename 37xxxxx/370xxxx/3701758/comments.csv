,Pyatin,2007-05-31T16:23Z,"I consider the quality 6.5, but many have stated it's closer to 7 or 7.5 in quality.  

Animated cartoon show based on the book by Canadian author Pierre Berton.  
Appeared on the 'Weekend Special' in the USA during the 80's in 3 parts.

This is the complete series joined into 1 movie. Original source was VHS cassette, possibly 2nd or 3rd generation.  Chapter & Root Menu's added.

Commercials removed."

,Pyatin,2007-06-08T00:00Z,"I'm going to limit the bandwidth on this torrent even though so few are seeding it.  If it takes you longer than normal to get it, I apologize.  However, I will not remove the torrent, so you will have the opportunity to get the whole file.  "
,Pyatin,2007-06-10T09:24Z,"I may be getting a significantly better quality version of this movie, possibly with subtitles too.  If the quality is at the level that is perceived, I will reseed the better version and delete this torrent."
,Pyatin,2007-06-15T22:19Z,I'm redoing some of my storage disks and adding another 2TB of space for upcoming uploading.  I apologize if you see holdups now and again.  Please be patient.  I have not stopped seeding.
,Pyatin,2007-06-26T17:16Z,"The release is now available for purchase in Canada.  However, it is in 3 sections with the intros and recaps instead of 1 solid show.  I will continue to seed this version, though the quality is not as good as the DVD release.  "
,EastCoastBoy,2007-07-02T17:08Z,I hope I can get this torrent entirely.  I don't mind the quality and I kinda like seeing it in this compiled fashion rather than what might be on the DVD release.
,EastCoastBoy,2007-07-04T22:08Z,"Somehow I can't seem to bet this to work now, it stop a shy 30% now, I'm hoping to get this finished before I lose interest in it altogether."
,Pyatin,2007-07-17T22:31Z,"It's still being seeded.  The connection might a bit low at times.  If there aren't many seeders, I actually reduce bandwidth a bit because that informs me that the interest is lower for this particular file."
,EastCoastBoy,2007-07-20T00:38Z,Sorry to hear you reduced the bandwidth.  Right now I'm at 64% and there doesn't seem to be any seeding activity for the moment.
,Pyatin,2007-08-01T04:04Z,"I don't like to reduce bandwidth, but I don't have any other way of keeping the movie going without others seeding.  It may be a bit slower, but you will get it.  If it shows that it's stopped for the moment, I have not stopped seeding it.  The bandwidth might be pushed temporarily to other seeds."
,bankone,2008-01-29T20:48Z,"currently d/l'ing
thanks for uploading this vid.
so long time ago, but I still remember it.
for some reason, I'm stuck at 98%
I know there's seeders...just wierd..would say failed hash check, keeps re-downloading the same thing"
,Pyatin,2009-02-14T08:58Z,"Not sure why.  It's still running.  Had more seeders, but they all hit & run.  Still available."
,madarab405,2009-05-06T00:49Z,if you would like a better copy http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4884433
,Pyatin,2009-07-11T07:42Z,"Due to the low seeders, and the fact that the DVD has been released and the avi file is quite decent, I will stop seeding this torrent July 31, 2009.  This will allow me to start seeding a few other rare movies. If anyone wants to continue seeding this, they may.  It's a rip from VHS and the movie is seamless.  I will say the DVD rip to avi is much better and suggest you DL, and seed that one.  It's been fun offering this.  Hope you all enjoyed."
