,YAZombie,2007-06-08T13:34Z,"Since you have a SN, how about going to the maker's website and download it from there?"
,bradfantin,2007-06-08T21:42Z,"i guess this suports 3d graphics, anyone try it out and know if its any good?"
,RunkNizze,2007-06-08T23:47Z,"shyny's serial number works OK.

If only flu33 could upload the serial number and a link to Parallels download, then he wouldn't have to seed ...

,gedm,2007-06-14T13:48Z,Don't worry about looking for a good key for XP pro.  Just use one of the dodgy ones and get all the updates from http://www.autopatcher.com/
