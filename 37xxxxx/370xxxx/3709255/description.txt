Overview:	Set in the 1930's, Magnificent Warriors stars Michelle Yeoh as Ming Ming, a whip-weilding biplane pilot in the Indiana Jones mold. She's called upon by the resistance to fly to the remote mountain city of Kaal, to pick up a spy named "Sky No. 1" (Derek Yee). He's got information, provided by the city's ruler, Youda, (Lowell Lo) on a Japanese poison gas plant in the works. However, things do not go smoothly: Ming Ming's plane is damaged in a dogfight with the Japanese, and then she mistakes a transient con-artist (Richard Ng) for her contact. Eventually, all the major characters come together to defend the city against the Japanese, who show up with tanks and mortars for a wildly destructive final battle.
