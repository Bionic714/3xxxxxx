- Release Notes
* 592x336 vs 624x352 from analog or dsr source
really makes no difference in quality.
* This is lossless motion, 29.97fps is half
motion when compared to the tv broadcast.
* yes, DSR rips are a little better quality, but
a lot less motion since they just use regular
deinterlaced to 29.97 so the choice it yours.
* Suggested player: VLC videolan.org
WMP is junk and will probably go out of sync
* Enjoy
