Hand picked by the man himself, the crew consists of a skeptical journalist, an ocean engineer, a scientist, and a psychic. With an attractive financial offer made to each of them, the crew will investigate the legendary, and very mysterious Bermuda Triangle to find answers. But as their findings deepen, the crew finds themselves surrounded by bizarre occurrences that only become all the more nightmarish. The offers made to them may have seem ideal at the time, but now they may have gotten in over their heads against something they may not understand.
