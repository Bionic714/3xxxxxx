,jebacmajki1977,2007-05-31T17:09Z,subs????
,xtomo1978x,2007-05-31T18:10Z,no
,jebacmajki1977,2007-05-31T19:07Z,"i'll never understand why people remove sub files from dvd, maybe because they are so biiig..."
,xtomo1978x,2007-05-31T19:41Z,becouse its a fanedit it means alot more work and some times in the deleted scenes have no subs and i think my self subs just spoil the film..
,nOmArch,2007-06-01T20:46Z,"yep, no subs for the deleted scenes so it would of been kinda pointless to include them in the movie and then have the most important scenes not subbed.

Does it also includes any subtitles?"
,NicoVO,2007-07-05T19:54Z,"Also, is this DVD-quality? (I really want good quality!)

Also answer my other question above, please."
,nOmArch,2007-07-22T16:35Z,not wanting to sound rude but why not just read the infomation for the torrent posted above?  it clearly states that this is in ENGLISH and that it is a DVD.  
,zardoc54,2008-02-11T10:41Z,"What quality are the ""added"" scenes?"
,soggyorigami,2008-04-23T16:53Z,Pal or NTSC?
,soggyorigami,2008-04-23T20:38Z,"Nevermind, its PAL."
