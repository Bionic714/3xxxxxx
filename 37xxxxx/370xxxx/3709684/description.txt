Made in 1973, Touki Bouki is an interesting example of the 'hybridization,' the mixing, of Western cinema and African story telling traditions. On the one hand, Mambety has been influenced by European film technique and technology. The 'continental non-linearity,' so to speak, and the stylistic self-consciousness of the film are reminiscent of 1960s European cinema. On the other, Mambety has transformed these into an African style and story. Some would argue he has been influenced as much by oral tradition as by cinematic conventions. He begins with Africa, then takes what he needs from Europe, and returns to Africa.
