,tjlmbklr1,2008-01-07T23:59Z,Glad to see I am not the only one looking for this movie. It was being seeded till i was a about 50% then stopped now i am just chipping away. at this rate I'll have it finished in 3-4 days.
,castrology,2008-06-21T02:52Z,"It'd be great if this could be seeded by someone who would actually like others to finish. If you're the sole seeder, the superseed it.  Right now 20 people have 81.7%, and we've managed less than 5% in 3 days.  I could likely re-shoot this film before the download finishes, as this rate."
