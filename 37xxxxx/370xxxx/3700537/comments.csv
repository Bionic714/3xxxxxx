,Shadowdragon5,2007-06-01T15:00Z,"Excellent download. Perfectly proportioned between DL size and quality - only slightly gritty on a 19"" screen, which isn't noticed at all 2 secs into the episodes, and would require several extra gigs to fix. Definately seeding this masterpiece. All Hail deathmule!!!"

im not shore about the VLC media player, i use InterVideo.WinDVD.Platinum to watch this files on my PC. yes, when you burn these files everything will work fine on your DVD player. let me know how it goes when you done burning it.

Put in a empty DVD and open Imgburn, when it
has found the DVD go to MODE and click at BUILD!

put all the file that your downloaded into the VIDEO TS folder then burn. no files go in the AUDIO TS folder.

its very easy look in the info box i have pic on how to burn with nero 

(how to burn) (this goes for all my releases)

first download nero (you can get nero from any torrent site) install and open nero. pick ""DVD-video"" then press ""NEW""

find the ""VIDEO_TS"" files and move them over to the left hand side 

http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v147/deathmule/19vb.jpg 


now just press burn and your done. now you can watch this on your stand-alone DVD player
