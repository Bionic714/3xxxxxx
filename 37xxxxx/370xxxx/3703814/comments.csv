no subs in mkv...waste of fucking time.

Man.. it is soooooo simple to add subs to the container.. do it yourself... don't complain about free stuff ;-)

If you can do this better, by all means post and upload mate, if not, shut up..

Uploader: many thanks for this one! :-D"

No mate, you need a h.264/VC-1 capable player that supports mkv like the one i have: Dvico TviX M4100SH http://www.tvix.co.kr/ENG/"
,rjames,2008-02-15T13:39Z,i am sharing the 1080p (30GB) at this moment. Took me 4 weeks. Anybody knows how to add subs to the original version? in this 720p release are the subs hardcoded?
