I've tried to make the filenames as useful as possible, numbering them sequentially so they will queue up correctly for playback.  However, I experienced a problem for some reason when I loaded them to my ipod.  The queued out of sequence.

The numbers, though physically present in the filename, did not appear on the ipod as part of the titles, so I had to manually edit the ID3 info for each entry to get them to play in the correct order.  Please note, I am using Winamp to manage and load my ipod files.  

Winamp doesn't support the audiobook function of the ipod so it was necessary to load the book as a collection of songs under the same album title as if it was one big music album with 107 songs in it.  I include this info in case anyone runs into the same problem.
