Release Notes:

Grammy-nominated rock powerhouse Stone Sour is set
to release a special, enhanced edition of their
Gold-Certified album Come What(ever) May on
Roadrunner Records on June 26. The special edition
is jam-packed with extensive bonus material. The
audio portion boasts six previously unreleased and
unavailable tracks, including an acoustic cover of
Chris Isaak's "Wicked Game," recorded live for a
Canadian radio performance earlier this year. The
bonus DVD features all four music videos from Come
What(ever) May: "30/30-150," "Through Glass,"
"sillyworld" and the band's latest "Made of Scars."
In addition, the DVD includes a never-before-seen
full concert performance. Filmed in October 2006 in
Moscow at the RAMP awards, the concert documents
Stone Sour's first and only visit to Russia, a
must-have for fans.

"Now before all of you fans get upset about a
re-release, (because I know how you are), let me
just say that I am an avid music fan and a record
collector. That's why, when the decision was made to
release a special edition, we knew that it had to be
just that: special," says guitarist Josh Rand. "We
added everything we could possibly get our hands on,
including an entire show from Russia, making it only
the greatest special edition ever! You guys are
gonna love it!"
