,smohanv,2007-05-31T21:39Z,"Hi,

Here is the step to have the mobile phone signed with IMEI.

As advised by gpsunderground, sign on to www.symbiansigned.com

go to this link https://www.symbiansigned.com/app/page/overview/latestProductUpdates
to donwload DevCertRequest and install it in your PC

Open the installed program ""Symbian Developer Certificate Request"" and follow steps and generate... select the required capabilities in step 4.

Once the *.csr is generated go to
https://www.symbiansigned.com/app/barclayhtml/devcert/requestupload.jsp

follow the steps..

wait for the page to load with your DevCert and download the same to your PC

Install it in your Nokia 95 and proceed installing the downloaded route66 application...

Hope it helps guys."

,kiptok,2007-06-12T20:30Z,"Hi all, the signing process works just fine by me. The install process too. But when I start the program, it opens for 0,5 seconds and me see something about productactivation and then closes again. I already tried it with maps of 2005 and 2006 and also the maps of route 66 v7. How do you guys get the program running?"
,kiptok,2007-06-12T21:45Z,"OK guys I finally found the solution: 
1) Format your sd micro (backup first) and reinstall the symbian so your telephone will be like new. 
2)Then install the program on (for example) your phone and add the maps on your sd micro! 
Now its working on mine! (btw: still have to test it outside but i will give an update then!"
