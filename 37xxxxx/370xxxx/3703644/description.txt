My Young Auntie aka Fangs of the Tigress (1980) - REMASTERED

HKFlix Says:  	3 Stars

For a film starring Lau Kar Leung, Hsiao Hou, Kara Hui Ying-Hung, Wang Lung Wei, and even Gordon Liu, there's surprisingly little action and a lot of nonsense. Nonetheless, their presence, and what little action there is, make the movie enjoyable.

Plot:	Director Lau Kar Leung's trademark emphasis on martial virtue is very evident in his kung fu comedy "My Young Auntie", which stars Kara Hui Ying Hung as a young heiress to an esteemed kung fu family embroiled in internal strife.

Overview:	Successful director Lau Kar Leung's (Liu Chia Liang) films usually had a strong traditional emphasis on martial virtue and the importance of family. This is very evident in his kung fu comedy "My Young Auntie", which stars Kara Hui Ying Hung as a young heiress to an esteemed kung fu family embroiled in internal strife. Her gutsy and dauntless performance opposite Lau's starring role as her calm to psychotic elderly nephew-by-marriage, earned Hui the Best Actress Award at the 1982 Hong Kong Film Awards.
