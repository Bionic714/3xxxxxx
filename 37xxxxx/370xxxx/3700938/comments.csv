,Jeff801,2007-06-06T13:55Z,indeed.... crack dont work for me either...
,papabob2,2007-06-10T13:03Z,Ok..The programme is fine and works well. Thanks to whoever...But if you find a folder marked:gifts!!! open at your peril...it is trogen or worm.
,papabob2,2007-06-10T13:55Z,It seems to me that most of the things we download contain viruses?Whatever?Don?t be complacent. Your MacAfee or Norton won?t pick em up!!! What you need is a dedicated Trojan searcher?Download the fully working 30 day trial app: Trojan hunter (find it yourself I can?t be bothered) it will find em for ya for free?nada?nufink?zilch?    
,bobpfam,2007-06-17T11:36Z,Crack doesn't appear to work - Help!
,mikkelbikkel,2007-06-22T16:50Z,Don't download this! it's a virus!
,lil_cutie_1269,2007-06-25T22:33Z,"there's no virus or folder called ""gift"" 
the crack works for me
i checked the files at virustotal.com
it's clean

heres how you get it to work
copy and paste the crack into the installation folder
then run the crack
don't delete the crack
leave the crack in there
as that is the exe for the program
that should do it

cheers"

,sargearoo,2007-06-25T23:41Z,"Call me a newbie, but the part about ""copy and paste the crack into the installation folder"" I am a little confused about.  Could someone please offer a little more detailed instructions on this step.  Thanks in advance."
,cricket4ever,2007-06-27T23:21Z,"no, the crack does not work. "

,obnoxiousacid,2007-08-28T15:48Z,worked for a few days then crashed. when reinstalled folder called gifts did appear but was just a list of ebooks or something. crack failed to work kept on asking me to buy
,IsItWorthIt,2007-09-01T10:36Z,"This works flawlessly for me! Superb, as it supports portable protection. You can protect your USB flash drive and it works on other computers. Crack worked like a charm. No virus. Thanks!"
,mrhahn530,2007-09-21T20:46Z,Anyone know how to get the password to work on AutoUnpack?  It won't prompt me for a password....I reall don't want to have to download winRAR...
,Midnitewolfy,2007-09-24T05:38Z,"LOL, some of you guys are retarded.

thats how cracks work, by performing an illegal action that makes the program full-version.

This copy is 100% successful. After its downloaded to prevent your antivirus from deleteing the crack, disable your antivirus, then unzip.  When you unzip the downloaded file, just run the setup and after its installed, go into the crack folder and copy that .exe

go to your C:program files/folder lock/

paste that exe right in there and then double click it.

then click ""patch"" and you're done."
,kingkhong82,2007-10-23T08:10Z,"Midnitewolfy is definitely correct. Understand that a ""crack"" is a means of bypassing the legallity of password to access the software. So it is a PIRATE means. Any antivirus program would usually (though not all > depends on how professional the code is written to confuse the antivirus program) recog crack as spyware/virus/trojan etc. DUN scan the crack files. Trust the crack as valid for the said software only. It shud be working > jus follow correctly the steps, as said by Midnitewolfy..... good luck"
,x86freak,2007-11-23T20:57Z,"Few words:
- The so called patch isn't a patch but a cheap-ass selfextracting archive with a GUI. A real/normal Patch modifies/changes the code of a target program. This one you can run anywhere and it'll spit out a prepatched(?) exe.

- Besides a cheap-ass 'patch', the program will expire after 36 locks and ask for registration.

So if you want to avoid more BS, try this download: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3827402/Folder_Lock_5.7.0_FULL_with_Registration_Info

I think it's better cuz:
a) Not an idiotic passworded archive
b) A simple Serial-to-Activate setup instead of fagy patch.

,Bruno000,2007-12-13T05:16Z,"thanks and regards, works great"
,GauravMitra,2008-06-24T16:30Z,I can't download softwares from this site.
,ledgend0123,2008-08-25T14:51Z,"TO NOOBS...

norton avg and other such antivirus tools almost always recognise cracked files as virus for the simple reason that these files are modified .exe's
next time you post comments saying the torrent has a virus make sure it isnt the crack retards

rare torrents have virus' in the crack now if your antivirus picks up sumthing other than the crack then tell us about it 

just dnt giv fucking false scares then ppl wont download this eg they wont seed it eg i wont get a fast download eg i will rape your mother.."
,tonyakajeff,2008-09-18T08:44Z,"ledgend0123 you are the tits its all true!!! cracks are found as a virus, but its NOT! well done for pointing that out to like the stupid people! A++++++++++++"
,2V3N0M0,2008-10-24T02:03Z,it seems AVG is fucking up and saying the crack is a virus or Trojan bullshit
,xrh74s,2008-11-26T16:15Z,"What's  the ""Trojan Horse Generic10.ARNW"" detected???"
