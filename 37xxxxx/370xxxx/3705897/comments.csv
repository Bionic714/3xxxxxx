,sing_sling,2008-01-04T15:59Z,Ditto on the subtitles . . . how can they be added?
,topio,2008-01-07T19:47Z,"The subtitles instructions are on a page somewhere that I can't remeber If Somebody does that would be great, this is a great movie thanks to elsebababe"
,markelos,2008-01-08T16:13Z,"To play the subs, place them in the same folder with the movie.They must both have the same name. If this doesn't work you probably lack some codec. I use media player classic which comes with k-lite mega codec pack."
