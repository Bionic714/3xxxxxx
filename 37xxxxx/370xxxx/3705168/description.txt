A small file with some original audio from the military takeover in Chile in 1973 which took place to prevent the downfall of the Chilean nation under the tyrrany of communism.

Listen to the beloved Junta generals like Augusto Pinochet and Admiral Jos√© Toribio Merino Castro swearing in as members of the government or the radial bands explaining the necessity of the takeover to the people. This file also includes some patriotic songs.


Enjoy !
And remember... Junta is good for the people ;)
