Badi Assad (bah-JEE ah-SAHJ) - Chameleon (1998)


``Badi transcends traditional styles of her native Brazilian music with an exotic mixture of ethnic sounds from around the world. As a result the extraordinary singer; guitarist, and percussionist is successfully forging an exhilarating genre of music that quite literally defies categorization.┬┤┬┤
