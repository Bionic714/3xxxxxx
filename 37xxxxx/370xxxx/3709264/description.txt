An excellent "train hard and get revenge" flick from Shaw Brothers Studios, this film features plenty of grueling training sequences and an incredibly satisfying finale.

Plot:	Fu Sheng plays Fong Sai-yuk. Some guys train to beat a murderous master, but they don't train enough and are killed half-way through the film, leaving the battle to men like Fu Sheng.

Overview:	The evil Manchu clan is determined to rid China of all kung fu rivals--only the ancient Shaolin school remains defiant. Their finest warriors murdered by two of the Manchu's ruthless hired assassins, the Shaolin turn in desperation to old masters in order to learn the ultimate secret martial arts disciplines--the only styles and tactics which might defeat their monstrous enemy. After months of agonizing training, the deadly Tiger and Crane combat styles are matched against the Manchu's lethal Steel Skin technique in a bloody battle to the death.
