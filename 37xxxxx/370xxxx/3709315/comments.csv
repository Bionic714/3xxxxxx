""Yes, the avi has a little problem, but there's a really simple solution. Install VirtualDub (download it at http://virtualdub.sourceforge.net/) After installing, start up the programme, open the avi, set the video and audio to 'direct stream copy' and save the file under a new name. The saving takes about 3 minutes, so you'll be able to watch the film on short notice after all :D"""
