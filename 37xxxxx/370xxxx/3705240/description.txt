First night with new 4 hour old panasonic DVD camera. I had just enough time to charge the battery and run out the door to the dirt track. My first video ever so I apologize for running out on the DVD with two laps to go. But the finish order didnt change anyway. I couldn't be happier with the camera and the quality of the video. It records in stereo so put on the headphones and crank it up!!! Enjoy.
