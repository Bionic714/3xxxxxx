,evilgrill,2008-04-29T18:57Z,please seed.
,clif1982,2008-05-12T17:34Z,"Thank you for the upload. I've run into a couple problems.

The main one, is it says the spoken language is english, spanish and the texted language is spanish.

I downloaded it just fine.
On some of these when it gets to 96 or 97 percent, they are finished, even though its not necessarily 100.   My problem is How do I play it?
I down loaded it but I have to click on the individual parts to play and then its in spanish. 
WIll one of you nice people tell me what to do with it, once its downloaded? I started to seed it when I finished, but then discovered  I couldnot understand what they said (I am american).

will you help me out here?  Please?  Thanks again. Picture quality is perfect. Just can't get it to play full length or in english.        sincerely, clif"

get vlc and choose ""open directory"" or burn the directory to dvd and play in dvd-player."
,MisterHeavy,2008-07-31T17:25Z,"I have an ETA of 96 days on this, after sitting on azureus all day - and that's based on the seed being available 24 hrs/day.

Would there be any chance of upping all - or some - of this onto Rapidshare, please?
Even better, on usenet? I'm intending to re-distribute this if I ever get hold of it (usenet again) and will advise via this page when I am able to do so.

I WAS going to buy this at Amazon, till I checked availability. 1 copy left. Go look at the price.

btw. On usenet I can usually d/l 1 or 2 dvd images a day. On a torrent I'm lucky to get it inside a week. 96 days is  going to drive me totally hey diddle diddle, the corpse playing fiddle, the zombie jumped over the loon....


Thanks - grateful thanks - for any help here.

be Good!"
,MisterHeavy,2008-08-01T10:48Z,"now coming down at a fair lick - eta before end of weeekend, I hope. Thanks for sitting on the seed. Watch this space."
,MisterHeavy,2008-08-06T23:02Z,"so much for optimism.

Now Wednesday, with an eta of 375 days

Even with 3 seeders sometimes available, best d/l speed is a few bytes under 1 kb.
Ports forwarded correctly, green smiley in Azureus etc etc. Firewall passing through correctly configured ports...

Inescapable conclusion is, unfortunately, that the whole torrent paradigm sucks."

I Discovered that series ""mystery science theater"". I had not paid it much attention but then I realized it had old movies in it.  There  are about 36 sets with 4 or 5 movies each.  Now, heres where it might be important and cool:
this sounds like the real thing. I'm downloading that set right now. It is slow as hell but steady (using dsl)    8 kbs and I'm at 9% with  3-15 seeds and  5-38 peers
