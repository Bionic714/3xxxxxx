In Healing, unexplainable phenomena are coming out of a new ministry at St. Anselm?s church. But after moving into the cult?s country manor to investigate, Father Gilbert suddenly finds himself not so much a house guest as a captive audience. Witnessing what appears to be a number of bona fide miracles, Gilbert has to wonder how they?re being done--and by whom.

His investigation takes him further into the troubled lives of the cult members. Some may be truly gifted, others may be counterfeits. But finding the truth requires a dangerous confrontation that could take more than one life.
