Gene Simmons: Family Jewels is a fresh, entertaining, and enjoyable show.

Unlike the Osbournes, Gene\'s children - Nick and Sophie - have obvious respect for their parents and are amazing at improv. This show has non-stop laughs that aren\'t cheap, and leave you thinking about them for a while. The episodes are watchable over and over, and never seem to get old.
