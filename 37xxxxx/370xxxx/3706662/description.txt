This is a "boxed set" of all three Riddick films;
Pitch Black
Dark Fury
Chronicles of Riddick

Note that both movies have been kept above 60% quality and the animated "dark fury" was well above 70%

I included images of the cover and both discs (Boxed set, it should at least come with 2 discs right?). All of which I scanned at 700 DPI, so they are quite good quality.

Nothing was removed from the DVDs. The two live action are still in Anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) and the Animated is just widescreen (1.85:1)

All three are in their unrated directors cut editions.

I believe that covers it. any questions just post.
