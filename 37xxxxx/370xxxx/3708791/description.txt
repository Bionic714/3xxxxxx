I, Videogame Episode 4

Ever since the invention of the computer, man has feared ?the machine? and its ability to think. 
But a computer?s unique computational power has also led to the development of games that are unpredictable, intelligent and malleable. 
?God games? like SimCity and Civilization simulate entire worlds and let players experiment with cause and effect. 
As the 1990s dawned, global turmoil forced gamers to find solace in the world of videogames ? a virtual world that offered control at a time when the real world seemed dangerously out of control. 
Now, videogames have become tools for learning and creative expression. 
Players use games like Halo and Unreal Tournament 3 to tell their own stories via Machinima or through custom content that is shared with others over the internet. 
The line between producer and customer has forever blurred ? further proof that videogames are destined to become the dominant form of entertainment. 
This episode features Will Wright (creator of SimCity, The Sims and Spore), Sid Meier (developed the game series Civilization) and John Brennan (voice actor from the Jerky Boys and Family Guy).
