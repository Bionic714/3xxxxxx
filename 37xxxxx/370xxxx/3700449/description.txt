Brilliant Comic Strip Done By Tim Buckley. 

Just thought someone else might like a complete archive of them from the first (20021023) up to (20070528) yesterday a total of 971 Comics that dealing with broad spectrum of subjects, almost all of them cracked me up ;)
 
http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com/comic.php will take you to his latest strip in the series. There is a new one every 2-3 days. I will also seed a add on update every month.
