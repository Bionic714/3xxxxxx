,=michael=,2007-06-05T18:37Z,"nina19820000
Utorrent does have a torrent maker!
very easy
Go here on the site to upload a torrent
There you will find a tracker past the track in your torrent maker
go and look for the file or folder you want to upload and thats all

You will find with google a lot of instructions of how to make a torrent!

good luck!"

,3CPTV,2008-09-16T07:39Z,=Michael= I think this needs  to be re-seeded 
,dopitak,2008-10-22T00:19Z,"Stuck on 74%, but week or two ago there were several seeders. Common lads,  help us to download it, please!"
,dopitak,2008-11-22T11:18Z,"Stuck on 96,6%. Common fellas."
