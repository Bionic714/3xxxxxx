Synopsis
A way out, uncivilized comedy about two Stone-Age Romeos who battle to win the affection of the voluptuous Barbara Bach. Shelley Long, Ringo Starr and Dennis Quaid also star.
Atouk is a bullied and scrawny caveman living in "One Zillion BC". He lusts after the beautiful but shallow Lana, who is the mate of Tonda, their tribe's physically imposing leader. After being banished along with his friend Lar, Atouk falls in with a band of assorted misfits, among them the comely Tala and the elderly blind man Gog. The group has assorted encounters with hungry dinosaurs, and rescues Lar from a "nearby ice age", where they encounter an abominable snowman. In the course of these adventures they discover drugs, fire, fried chicken, music, and learn how to walk upright. Atouk uses these advancements to lead an attack on Tonda, overthrowing him and becoming the tribe's new leader. He discards Lana and takes Tala as his mate, and they live happily ever after.
