,utr07,2007-06-05T21:45Z,"Is this the ""official release"" as the previous torrent wasn't ?
Is everything working ? Cause in the other one ENCORE was not working properly (couldn't start)

I really hope so because I didn't start to use ""Premiere"" before I was sure that I was able to export it to DVD"
,MrMansson,2007-06-05T23:59Z,"This can't be the final version since it's not done yet- many bugs are still being ironed out with the help of beta testers.
This is most likely a home made bundle with the public betas of Premiere and After Effects.

Too bad that MAGNITUDE is putting their name on this."
,zarakll,2007-06-06T00:03Z,is this only english or multilanguage????
,enyceexdanny,2007-06-06T02:49Z,"Just because it's not out doesn't mean it's not done.

As I've mentioned on the other torrent, this isn't a home made compilation with the betas mixed in.

,o.owner,2007-06-07T14:28Z,Norman V5.9 found a TROJAN in this download! 
,MrMansson,2007-06-07T22:07Z,"enyceexdanny: you are right in principle about being done and being out.

But I visit the After Effects and Premiere forums daily and they are still fixing bugs and taking reports. So I don't think it's done yet.

Of course- I'm sure the testers have access to a complete bundle like the final product and that that bundle gets upgraded to newer and newer versions.
This torrent may be one of those bundles. 

But another reason that I don't think that this is retail is the size. The CS2 Production Studio alone was 16 GB (and that's fewer programs than the Master's). 
I guess this might be a late Masters bundle with the core applications but without all the goodies (presets, sound loops and other extras).

In that case I'd upgrade this to 'a nice release' but I'd still wait for retail as I will download that anyway.

Thanks for the heads up to those that report back."

,desertwalker,2007-06-28T07:30Z,"G'day people,

Before you apply any .dll to any file. Run the first disk install. Foolow the appropriate cues. 

When you get to the serial page. That is when you apply the .dll. Copy it to C:/program files/common files/adobe/installers/ and a folder that will have a long name. The rest of the files in that folder will be .cab files, so you will know where to copy it too.

Ovberwrite, close up the folders, and then type any serial you want.

When all the set up is complete, and it does take a while. Before you start any of the programs, just cut and paste all the crack files into the appropriate folder, and all will work well. Any problems, ask again"
,demonoidfreak666,2007-06-28T10:04Z,"ok i put the .dll file in and every thing installs but when i try to start the program it tells me that there is something wrong with the serial #. in the text it says to put the .dll file in when promted to put in the key did that, but after that in the text it says ---Overwrite cracked files after installed.--- what do i do at this step?   "
,desertwalker,2007-06-28T12:42Z,"where did you install the .dll

Do exactly what it says. You should have a folder that is labelled Magnitude. In here are all the cracked files. You have to place them in the appropriate folders. You have to let me know excatly what you are doing. Will check this post within next 24hrs"
,demonoidfreak666,2007-06-28T20:55Z,"i took the asneu.dll file and put it in the program files/common files/Adobe/installers/some long dirname folder. put in some #'s for the key .

in the text file what does it mean, Overwrite cracked files after installed.  it says this after  

""when installing when asking install serial, overwrite asneu.dll to program files/common files/Adobe/installers/some long dirname. Then enter any serial u want!""

,badgercat,2007-06-28T23:08Z,"Ok! You have to copy individual .dll files from the corresponding programme folders in the magnitude folder. Open for example the soundbooth folder, you will find a file called appmodule.dll. Go to the real soundbooth file on your local disc and replace that file. Repeat for all the other programmes. They open straight away. Where .dll files don't exist simply replace the .exe files instead"

How do I unmount a disk?"
,potterrulez,2007-07-06T23:34Z,"After looking into MagicISO a bit I can see where you're having the problems in that it simply extracts the files from the ISO file.  

I would suggest downloading Daemon Tools (just search on Google) which will create a virtual CD/DVD drive onto which ISO and other image files can be mounted.

You can then mount disc 1, when asked for disc 2 - unmount disc 1 and mount disc 2."
,demonoidfreak666,2007-07-07T00:13Z,"You need to mount the disc # to the same drive that you used for disc 1. 

You should be able to right click on the ISO file and chose the virtual drive you want to mount it to.

For so many weeks i have been listening craps about how this is some lame fake release with mix of half tested betas and no working retails, how this is just another fake signed by magnitude signature...and so on ,and so on...

Crap.THIS IS TRUE WORKING MAGNiTUDE ISO RELEASE and all of you making this respected group look foulish  should at first look at some things and facts.

This release contains 4 ISO DVDs and there are not any complications if you just follow the procedure.If you are having trouble  mounting the discs just simply BURN them with Alcohol 120% and follow standard installation procedure!!!

There can be some problems with insatllation if you have relics of old CS1 or CS2 programs so first uninsatl any previous versions and then install this one...

Conserning ENCORE it works perfectly if you have enabled VersionCue CS3.Now in previous versions like CS1 and CS2 VersionCue was automaticly enabled as background service but not this time.SO just go to control panel and enable VersionCue CS3 and everything works perfectly!!!!!!!

For all those saying some apps are missing in the release they should read some stuff more carefully.

ADOBE ONLOCATION and ADOBE ULTRA are special services and technologies incorporated in MAster suite !

ADOBE ONLOCATION  is NOT standalone application but is integral part of ADOBE PREMIERE!!!

Thus this release shurely has some bugs but it is true and it is MAGNiTUDE


big THX to MAGNiTUDE

you done it again"
,VforVendetta,2007-07-13T20:17Z,"@savage2004

yes i am talking about regular XP control panel(START/Control Panel) and after you gain access of it you should be see green/blue square icon named Adobe Version Cue CS3 like in all other previous versions.If you installed succesfully all Master Suite it should be defenetly  there.Its not even necessary to permanently activate it , just start it once and Encore will work right away..."

------------------------------------------
On a separate note:

Adobe will be releasing their premium video package and master collection as a FULLY FUNCTIONAL trial version, BUT ONLY as a DVD set. They will NOT be available for download (big files). This trial will be upgradable to full product with a serial number.
This release will be in the next 6 weeks or so.

At the latest when this trial hits the streets, we can expect a true master collection torrent with working keygen- just the way we are used to."
,VforVendetta,2007-07-15T19:48Z,"Think we just have to wait for the proper keygen which will be able to unlock all the extras from this release...

I really doubt that MAGNiTUDE would release some fake release ...just think for a second...Adobe Creative Suite Design Premium was a proper ISO,Adobe Creative Suite Web Premium was a proper ISO...all released by the same team...so i am pretty sure that this is it

just have to wait for a litle bit"
,MrMansson,2007-07-16T11:59Z,"The other releases from Magnitude, i.e Design Premium and Web premium are of the highest quality. No debate there.

The thing with this release is that it is not final. The installer is legit and it's possible that the code is final in the included apps, but I think that this might be the last internal test version of the Master Collection from Adobe.
Ultra CS3 should be included here, but isn't. It's quite possible that Adobe did some separate testing on this and that it got finished last.

Nonetheless... This release should make it possible for most to run the main apps, including the video suite, possibly without the option to update them online since there is no working keygen. But by the time there are important updates the 'real' final collection should be conveniently available.

I'm installing now on a secondary platfrom and I might report back what works and what doesn't."
,VforVendetta,2007-07-16T12:34Z,"I think Adobe Ultra CS3 could be coming on separate DVD as an addon to this release like some major MAGNiTUDE update.Yet I really doubt that any group is going to release in near future Master Collection as an ISO and MAGNiTUDE is surely not going to discredit themselves by releasing some form of final ISo.That just isnt the way the scene functions.There are only few other groups that are able to make proper releases from Adobe but a very few of them ever made ISOs.We could espect that from AGAiN yet more likely is working keygen for this release even tho they released really quality releases with Adobe GoLive and Adobe Acrobat 3D which are not integral parts of Master Collection.SSG group would be my other guess yet their ISOs can late for a year or even more.All others like X-Force,Paradox ...are doing only lame rips so wouldnt be counting on them.

Again I really belive this is final ISO and dont think other will come soon.

Proper keygen will do the job...regarding that try this new Premiere keygen and no error will encounter"
,MrMansson,2007-07-16T12:41Z,"Vfor...

I appreciate you thoughts even though we clearly differ on some points.

I am simply referring to the fact that Adobe will soon ship the FULL MC on DVD as a trial. When that happens we may or may not see a new release from *someone* with a working keygen. That would- on my part- be much prefered to applying cracked files on each app.

Apart from that- you mention a keygen for Premiere. Would you mind linking directly to it, or state the complete name? 

(in the mean time I'll go looking)"

,MrMansson,2007-07-16T13:20Z,"UPDATE:

I added to my already installed Web- and Premium install with this installer (e.g. not a clean install).

Everything went smoothly.

All the apps start and closes without hickups. Did some basic image import in PPRO and AE and saved projects before closing.

Bridge starts and ads extensions for new apps (PPRO, AE, SB, CONT).

Uploader starts and updates all apps including itself.

FW and CONT got updated and start normally.

All seems ok wich is.... NICE.

Can you confirm that when you install this release as per the readme (install crack- any old serial), that it is THEN possible to activate the individual apps without applying any further cracks to them, i.e. in the application folders?

I installed without crack with the MC keygen (no support for activation), but this calls for activation with MC serials ONLY. And until there is a proper MC keygen there's no solution.

What could be the reason that a MC keygen is lacking? It can't be more difficult to make one for the MC than for the other suites and the others were released quickly."

Thanks!"
,MrMansson,2007-07-20T11:11Z,"DJH345:

The problem you are describing is related to your computer setup and how you have installed your mounting software. There is nothing in the ISOs that point to a certain drive.

Try to add more virtual drives to your mounting software. Then mount on a letter you've never used before (no auto mount or auto play).
Check in 'My Computer' to see if the disc gets mounted.
Then 'explore' the disc and click the autostart.exe

Other than that. Clean your system from old installs of Adobe apps or suites. Adobe offers a cleaup script.

Or better yet: offer Adobe SOME money by ordering the full MC trial on DVD, including Ultra and OnLocation.
For the price of a couple of pizza slices you get retail discs. The keygen with activation is bound to be released soon.

The DVDs is what I recommend everyone to do. I mean, come on... $24!?!?!"
,VforVendetta,2007-07-20T11:20Z,"Do you really belive that this trial MC DVD will be so easily activated by some keygen.Be serious man, you really think that Adobe will actualy throw couple of thousands worth colllection of apps so that someone can just download a simple keygen from any place on the net and transform a 20$ in 2000$ or more???So far Adobe trials could never be made into full softwares and i really doubt that this will be possible this time either.Considering ISOs I think/correct me if I m wrong/that MAGNiTUDE release is still only on the scene so..."
,MrMansson,2007-07-20T13:04Z,"Yes, I do think that.

For years it has been possible to download trial software that unlocks to full potential through a keygen. Macromedia products come to mind, as well as stand alone Adobe products.

Recent examples are the keygens for Design and Web premium. They don't require 'cracked' torrent releases to unlock. You may as well order directly from Adobe.

Does this really surprise you?

Although I suspect the age difference between us to be a good 10 years, the torrent scene is clearly dominated by younger individuals.

Abobe is actively combating piracy on a professional level, and officially on all levels. To label a ""college aged man illegally unlocking a  $2500 software suite"" as a $2500 loss of income is a laughable attempt at sqewing the figures.

Even though they would never confirm it, my estimate is that Adobe looks the other way, full well knowing that they are broadening their user base. When the young man grows up, earning real money, he will still want to use the products he knows so well.

Computer business is all about maket domination.

Piracy is no real loss if the individual would never buy the software anyway. 

I am self learning these products now without the risk of investing. Once my business have black numbers I'll hold valid licenses for sure.

So, yes. I think there will be a keygen. Just like a 1000 times before.

Read up on Adobe. Prior trial versions were striped. With CS3 they've made a strategic decision not to strip them. When the keygens out they will have made $25 from me that they wouldn't have other wise. Smart.

And I doubt that I'm alone in ordering the DVDs..."

I fully respect your opinion although I doubt there is so much of age difference between two of us.We are just coming from different backrounds/social,political and undoubtedly geographical/ so we may have certain different points of view.I am coming from a southeast Europe were a precentage of illegalIpirated software on the market is hardly belivable 70%!!!A couple of years ago it was almost 90%.We hardly have a laws against piracy and belive me we are far from some undeveloped country.My point is , here in this region people are never going to buy softwares nomatter how much money they earn.

You are right about some Macromedia products, but that definetly does not stand for Adobe.

Will be there a keygen, maybe no, more likely yes, but that does not change the meaning of true ISO release.

In the end , it is all about market but remember software market is far away from just US market.There are other countries and regions in this world beside USA!!!"
,yingjai,2007-07-20T15:48Z,"The so called VforVendetta guy is just trying to spread doubt. If you follow the instructions, this release works fine (I'm on Vista). Just don't try to update it."
,MrMansson,2007-07-20T16:35Z,"Yingjai:

VforVendetta sticks to his believes, but I don't think he's trying to stir people up.

This release is 85-90% working.

If you follow directions you get a cracked Master Collection without OnLocation CS3 and Ultra CS3.

The cracks used causes some problems with the titler in Premiere Pro, but that is fixable.

What's more serious is that since there is no serial activation in this crack, you don't get dynamic link. The D.L. feature is a suite feature that needs either a Production Premium or Master Collection serial.

VforVendetta claims to have it cracked with D.L. working and I suspect he used the install crack, but then activated Premiere Pro with a keygen (available), but he hasn't confirmed this. Maybe he will when he reads this, or explain his procedure.

Personally, I want Ultra CS3, so I ordered the trial DVDs and I'm hoping for a quick MC keygen release."
,NoRefund17,2007-07-20T18:59Z,MrMansson where is the working keygen that doesnt support activation that you talked about?  If used with certain other cracks that could come in handy for some i think :). If you could post a link woudl be apreciated

--------------------------------------

Karevilija posted this:

Here you go, an easy to follow guide - hope it helps

1) Use Serial Key 1325-1241-2418-5943-6555-6281 - Full Installation
2) Go To C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Contribute CS3\ and make a back up of AdobeLM_libFNP.dll (cut and paste it to a totally different folder)
3) Copy AdobeLM_libFNP.dll (from Crack Directory) to C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Contribute CS3\
4) Open Up Adobe Contribute (must be adobe contribute) and when prompeted select other activation options > activate by phone
5) In the Authorization Box, Put in any of these keys followed by the last 4 digits of your activation number

5019-5019-6451-5015-5174
5148-5343-5134-5214-5062
5019-5019-6451-5431-5430
5341-6403-5519-5062-5062
5341-6403-3019-5062-5062
5341-6403-3024-5062-5062
5341-6403-3056-5062-5062
5341-6403-5554-5062-5062
3019-6403-6403-5062-5062
3019-3019-6403-5062-5062
3019-3019-6451-5062-5062
5019-5019-6451-5062-5062
5019-5019-6451-5431-5430

So if your Activation number is 4769-6917-0089-5090-7412-5478-4895
Your authorization number becomes 5019-5019-6451-5015-5174-4895
6) You may have to press the activate button several times for it to activate, and also start adobe contribute and follow the steps a few times for this to work.
7) Copy the original AdobeLM_libFNP.dll back to C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Contribute CS3

---------------------------------------
The thing is that it appears to not work. When you click telephone activation and put in the code it first says that the code is invalid. You must then quit the process and restart Contribure as if nothing happened. 
Do the exact same thing once more. Do not auddenly change to another serial or number. Use the same one that didn't work. 
If you still get denied do it once more, same numbers. 
For some reason (some file might get updated during the process) it suddenly works. It is VERY counter intuitive.
BUT: when you notice that it accepts the activation number DO NOT immediately close Contribute. Let the screen ""please register contribute"" show up. You don't have to register.
After that you are home free.

I KNOW that it works and I don't care why."

,29THCIRCUSFREAK,2007-07-30T23:37Z,"foakaces in order to unrar you need to get winrar! download it!!! Then you need to extract the files using the Winrar program, once you have the files extracted you need to burn the images using a burning program like nero or roxio (I am guessing, I don't know what program to use I am still on the dl status!!) once this is done you load each of the disk on to the computer using the steps provided by V

I got the warning, ""You cannot use this product at this time. You must repair the problem by unistalling then reinstalling or contact your it admin or adobe for technical support"" too because I was lazy and just dragged all the files into the Adobe folder. :) The separate crack files in the Magnitude folder have to go into the various identical folders in the Adobe Programs folder. Also, the dll's can be dragged but the .exe's need to be copied and pasted into the folders. After I did that, everything worked fine excepts Encore.

I got it to work GREAT, for one DAYYY! HA.  But now when I try to open up any of the programs I get     ""PRODUCT LICENSE EXPIRED"" and the program closes.

I dont know if this matters, but I didn't use the crack, I used a separate Keygen.

ANY IDEAS???"

,Mamikins,2007-09-04T06:49Z,"The reason why we are all getting the ""Product Expired"" message is because Adobe has been sending patches through AdobeUpdator to stop us from using Pirated version of their software.  To work around this, there are two options: 1. reinstall the windows, install CS3 without being connected to the net at all, use the keygen, stop Adobe Updator, or find another keygen... run WinCS3Cleaner; wipe the old serial, then when asked, put a new serial created by the new keygen."
,Darknessmdk,2007-09-04T14:34Z,"I'm not reinstalling windows... I just set my time back a month and  the whole collection works again. Its a temp work around but it will do for now. 

What other keygens work? the ones I found have virus"
,Mamikins,2007-09-05T14:19Z,"Darkness, 

Another temporary solution to this is to set your PC's clock Before August 31st.  The patch adobe sent through AutoUpdator was to excecute on August 31st... so you need to set the clock before that date.  Then your CS3 will again start to work. Obviously it is not the best solution, but maybe okie till we find another keygen.

Make sure your AdobeUpdator is blocked in your firewall, and also stop Updator to automatically download and install update.  You can do so from Help menu of CS3 software.  You first make it update check for updates.  It will show you how many updates are available (do not download and install anything at this point).  You should see ""Preference"" at the bottom of that box; click on it and disable automaticupdate.  Then block Updator in your firewall setting.  Hope this helps."
