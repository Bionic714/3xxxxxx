CPRx is a unique and innovative solution to copy new DVD movies which contain bad sectors or bad DVD structure. Many popular DVD movies are now created in such a way as to make it difficult for backup software to copy them properly. This can result in errors during the copy process, or bad playback after the copy is completed.

In order to copy a DVD which has been authored using these new schemes, 1CLICK DVD COPY now utilizes state of the art CPRx technology to ensure the highest level of success when making an archival backup. Just as we've become accustomed to relying on anti-virus software to keep us protected against the latest viruses, we must also rely on new updates of CPRx to ensure we can copy the latest DVD releases. With 1CLICK's update notification feature, you can rest assured that you will be notified every time a new version of the software is available.

Changes in 1CLICK DVD Copy 5.2.2.1 (May 29, 2007):
- Fix for movies like "Apocalypto", in which the main audio language is "unspecified" and is not automatically selected (ie. default language is English will result in only English audio being selected). The software will now enable unspecified languages when including extras or if they contain more channels than the default language in movie only mode.
