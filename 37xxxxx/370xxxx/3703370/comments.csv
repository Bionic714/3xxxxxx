Installed it, appears to be working as ordered.  Thanks boorstar!"
,greybigtop,2007-06-02T13:32Z,"Does not work, - patch probably outdated.
When attempting to patch it says ""file not found""!"
,unloosed,2007-06-02T20:39Z,"greybigtop: is your main drive, where Windows is installed, the C drive?  I'm assuming it only looks in one location.

Trying placing the patch in the same directory the AnyDVD application and then patch again."
,greybigtop,2007-06-02T21:38Z,"I have done that allready, but I get the same result on 4 different PCÂ´s.
FILE NOT FOUND!


PS:

I see some new files added to the ANYDVD folder, but the trial period remains."
,ehvwheelboy,2007-06-03T17:03Z,works very good no problems here thanks
,TommyKat,2007-06-03T19:52Z,"This is a  TEAM RESURRECTiON patch and they have an excellent reputation for putting good cracks and patches however, this one does not work w/ ver 6.1.6.0"
,TommyKat,2007-06-03T20:55Z,"Okay, I rescind my last comment. Apparently the patch does work, but TEAM RESURRECTiON created the patch to only work if AnyDVD is installed on drive C: Path = C:\Program Files\SlySoft\AnyDVD"
