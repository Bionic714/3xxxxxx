Does anyone have the proper reg. code?  Otherwise this would be a most awesome torrent - you could test out a $650 program to see if you can use it, before losing that much money, if you can't.  PLZ - can anyone help the installer and reg. code/serial?

,maffew,2011-01-02T15:23Z,"Hi, this is a great find, thank you!

To everyone - this is the LIBRARY, without the installer software.  For all of you that can't figure out how to install correctly, download this torrent, and then follow my directions.

1. To download the INSTALLER (because this torrent is only the library), use this link: http://home.no/thepretender/colossus_setup_no_libary.rar (previously given by morott). 
*PLEASE NOTE* there IS a working keygen in this download, so disable your antivirus software for a short amount of time.

2. Unrar the file, colusses_setup_no_library > EastWest > colossus > run 'Colossus Setup'. Go through steps until you reach the name & serial number information.

3. Open keygen, found in the same folder as the Installer. On keygen, go to the Serial tab, and click ""Generate"". Once having the key, enter it into the Serial Number portion in the installer window. (Use your name or any name you'd like for the name portion)

4. Click next on the installer, DONT CLOSE THE KEYGEN. Choose which options you want, personally I left everything as-is.

5. Let Installer install Colossus onto your computer.

6. Once installed, UNcheck ""Show the ""readme"""" & ""Start East West Colossus now"". Click Finish, this will bring you to the registration tool.

7. In registration tool, the top big number is your system ID, and beside it is a ""copy"" button. Click Copy and then in the already-open keygen, click the actual Keygen tab, delete all the words inside the box, and paste the System ID. Once the ID is in the box, click Generate. Go back to Registration Tool, skip step #1, and in step #2, click ""Paste from Clipboard"", and it will copy & paste the number given from the keygen. Click ""comeplete"" at the bottom of the registration, then ""exit"". Colossus is now registered, you can close your keygen, and turn on your anti-virus.

8. Once and ONLY if this torrent is 100% finished downloading (it took me 2 weeks), find the location you installed everything to ( C:/East West/Colossus - unless you changed it) and copy the WHOLE COLOSSUS LIBRARY FOLDER into this location.

9. You now have a registered, full version of East West Colossus.

For all those still having problems after using my instructions, post a comment on here, or send me an email to maffewwww@gmail.com"

,SCOREGOD,2011-11-25T06:27Z,"Confirmed as working fine with Windows 7 64bit

This is the Libary and you have to download the installer with the keygenerator. Its done quickly and easy.

The download of this libary takes some time because there are not many seeder. Took about a week for me :)
