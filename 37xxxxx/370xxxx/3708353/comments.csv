,Khala,2007-12-16T08:15Z,"Of course antivirus programs say that there are trogans on this.
Cracks sends data in the directory to window archives to ""activate"" the program.
This is against ToS of Windows and illegals.
Of course, there is always some f***** who loads some of his/her own trojans, viruses, malware, etc. into the files.
But that is the risk you are taking to get your windows copy for free."
