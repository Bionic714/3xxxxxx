,Pyatin,2007-06-15T22:20Z,I'm redoing some of my storage disks and adding another 2TB of space for upcoming uploading.  I apologize if you see holdups now and again.  Please be patient.  I have not stopped seeding.
,no-logic,2007-10-24T18:30Z,"Great, I've been looking for this movie forever! Keep seeding, I know I will :D"
,moxieman1,2008-04-30T02:16Z,Any chance this could still be seeded?
,Pyatin,2008-05-11T01:31Z,Still seeding.
,farookjr,2008-06-10T01:11Z,"I have been looking for this movie since I can remember...

I hope you are still seeding it... I am only seeing 1 Seeder... I plan to seed afterwards.."
,teacherdan,2008-12-08T02:55Z,Thanks...I'll seed this until it's at a ratio of 10.

I plan to seed to 2:1

Thanks SO MUCH!"
