Synopsis: ?Im not living with you?, Maggie snaps at Brick. ?We occupy the same cage, thats all?. The raw emotions and crackling dialogue of Tennessee Williams 1955 Pulitzer Prize-winning play rumble like a thunderstorm in this film version whose fiery performances and grown-up theme made it a box-office hit.
Paul Newman earned his first Oscar nomination for his nuanced portrayal of troubled former sports hero Brick. Capturing her second, Elizabeth Taylor makes Maggie the Cat, digging her claws in and holding on to life not as it is, but as she hopes it someday will be, a vivid portrait of passionate loyalty.
