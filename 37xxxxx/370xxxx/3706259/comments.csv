,WoAnerges,2009-04-23T14:39Z,bitrate plz!!!
,Phreak-Wen-C,2009-05-30T03:15Z,"...the file size says it all.
it looks 192kb/s max or variable bitrate in that region."
,Phreak-Wen-C,2009-05-30T03:28Z,"So... for anyone who might givafuk - There is a torrent on Mininova called ""The Chemical Brothers Discografia 2007 [www torrentspain com]"" - it has less file compression and includes all the major albums.
This torrent is still good for all the extra goodies.

Peace with a phatty bassline."
