,john111111111111111111111,2008-02-02T08:59Z,not a ****ing rar file  - I only want about 10 of the songs :-(
,DarkCrow,2008-02-04T14:33Z,"Hey mattack!

Nice upload, thanks"
,-Sacred-,2008-02-25T07:05Z,idiot!!!!!!!!!!!!!! why fucking one rar file! we have most of those
,phoenix_red1988,2008-03-17T22:21Z,Why don't you shut up and be greatful that you could even get this for free. If you guys only want a few songs or don't like the torrent formate then use limewire or find another Madonna Discography torrent.
,deen66,2008-03-22T10:56Z,"nice, thanx"
,jasperpie,2008-03-24T11:59Z,thats alot of maddonna - much appreciated.  
,phoenix_red1988,2008-03-29T00:59Z,"This torrent is a horrible!! Stupid idiot hispanics can't do anything correctly. First off, this is AMERICA - speak and type english. Also, the damn songs which I upload into iTunes are screwed up. Why the hell do you idiots have all the covers into one folder - it's suppose to be in the original folders. Lazy bastards - I hate being the only smart spick in this damn world. Oh and by the way, if you don't know all album years - then don't bother to put them up as the name of the folders. If you're really smart you'd actually google it and get your lazy asses to do something instead of being such a bloody fucking couch potato! >_"
,WonderSlug,2008-03-30T00:44Z,Is the Erotica album in this collection the Explicit version or the Clean version?
,phoenix_red1988,2008-03-31T13:07Z,"Okay, I did some fixes on this torrent! Check it out!

,amberdelica,2008-04-06T07:48Z,"phoenix, why are you such a dick?"
,GN85,2008-04-09T23:48Z,amberdelica shut the fuck up.
,westernicelander,2008-06-07T22:02Z,thanks for the torrent. some of the comments were uncalled for. 
,lightsinthebay,2008-06-10T11:04Z,"""First off, this is AMERICA - speak and type english.""

- Actually this is the internet, which I think you will find is worldwide (think www), and this site in particular is from Europe, Sweden to be precise."
,mariotje,2008-06-10T15:22Z,Thank you verry nice..............!!!!
,ting,2008-06-18T21:23Z,Try to avoid .RAR in torrents. Torrents are a genius thing because you can collect what you want/need and leave the rest ... And if not rar'ed people could seed while listening. I doubt people would like to have the same file twice on the drive.
,faithie270,2008-06-19T15:40Z,"Thanks mattack. We really need more devoted people like you on TPB. ^^ Will be seeding as long as I live! or at least as long as my computer doesn't get reformatted. :) 

External hard drives are really cheap nowadays, get one and store all your torrents there, you people. Erm not insulting or anything. Just that so many people complain whenever they see something that they don't like. Remember that this is for FREE and you were supposed to pay for it. If you want to complain, why don't you buy the music yourself. 

Oh and once again, thank you so much for the torrent. Or else I would have to spend months collecting the songs, gathering from all over the internet."

,Summersky,2008-09-01T16:57Z,"Look, you can't blame the Americans for forgetting that they aren't the only ones on the internet. Even their own regulatory governing bodies restrict content from American sites from being accessed from outside the United States. Just another prime example of how more and more, the Americans alienate themselves from the rest of the universe. If you want the perks and benefits of living in North America and to experience what ?real? freedom is about, then move to Canada. Otherwise, staying in Europe would be the best option.
Anyways, enough of the geopolitical bullshit, how about more reviews on this torrent?"
,trevfz666,2009-01-02T00:57Z,"@ PHOENIXRED_1988...
You are the reason that I, as an American, put a Canadian maple leaf on my bags when I travel.
You are such an ignorant fool!"
,wontgetfooledagain1,2009-01-23T16:04Z,"Um, can we stop dwelling on that Phoenix guy and comment on the QUALITY, people??"
,gladriel69,2009-06-08T20:31Z,"I note the Evita Soundtrack is not the double album version, tut tut tut, call yourself a Madonna fan? For shame, for shame."
,gladriel69,2009-06-08T20:33Z,"On a positive note however this is the only torrent I can find with the complete Who's That Girl Soundtrack, so thank you very much!"
,tooma2,2009-06-30T10:12Z,dude. rar file? are you serious?
,TorrentAffair,2012-06-19T02:25Z,"phoenix_red1988's awful spelling and grammar show he is clearly unable to make intelligent comments, so please don't let him speak for or represent all Americans in your minds. We are not all hateful ignorant racist tools. Unbelievable. "
