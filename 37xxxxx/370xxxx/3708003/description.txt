\\\"It\\\'s better to burn out than to fade away.\\\"

There are times when it\\\'s right and proper to simply bury the dead. This is not one of those times...Gram Parsons was one of the most influential musicians of his time; a bitter, brilliant, genius who knew Elvis, tripped with the Stones and fatally overdosed on morphine and tequila in 1973. And from his dying came a story. A story from deep within folklore; a story of friendship, honour and adventure; a story so extraordinary that if it didn\\\'t really happen, no one would believe it. Two men, a hearse, a dead rock star, five gallons of petrol, and a promise. And the most extraordinary chase of modern times.

Grand Theft Parsons is a 2003 movie based on the true story of the legendary country musician Gram Parsons, who died of an overdose in 1973. Parsons and his road manager, Phil Kaufman (played by Johnny Knoxville) made a pact in life that whoever died first would be cremated by the other in the Joshua Tree National Park, an area of desert they both loved and cherished.

Parsons\\\' death prompts Kaufman to fulfill his promise and a subtle black comedy unwinds, with Kaufman bribing mortuary personnel, renting a psychedelic hearse and trekking across the US, pursued all the while by Parsons\\\' ex-girlfriend (Christina Applegate) and his father.

Produced by Frank Mannion, directed by David Caffrey and written by Jeremy Drysdale, Grand Theft Parsons was shown at the London Film Festival in November 2003 and also appeared at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2004.
