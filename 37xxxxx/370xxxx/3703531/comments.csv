,reaper2040,2007-06-14T01:15Z,"I've the same problem here as with the others: I can't copy or run the crack, says I don't have permission, disk may be write protected, etc."

,cw3le,2007-07-21T22:01Z,THIS TORRENT IS INFECTED WITH VIRUS!! AVG REPORTS THAT CRACK FILE IS POTENTIAL HACK TOOL OR SOMETHING!!! DON'T DOWNLOAD!!!
,larsjf,2008-01-06T19:23Z,"I got the same message when trying to patch it:
""can not access the file. maybe it's in use""

Anyone know what to do with this? Is there a problem with using it with Vista?"
,djfg,2008-05-17T10:06Z,"The most likely cause of the problem y'all are running into ('can not access the file. maybe it's in use') is that your AV software is blocking access to (or the execution of) the crack file because it is infected.
