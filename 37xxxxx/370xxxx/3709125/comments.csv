,4X-AXG,2007-06-09T21:28Z,"ripper: N537JB?
supplier: N537JB?

bullshit. Sangeki is the ripper and supplier of this add-on. taking credit for another guy's release..wow..that's just pathetic..posting his share here is one thing, but actually saying you're the ripper and supplier is just pathetic"
,Sangeki,2007-06-09T21:54Z,"lol, yeah it's a bit weird.

The serial is only one character different then the one I posted on usenet and N537JB doesn't actually run fsx last thing I heard but who knows..."
,chlwotjd,2007-06-09T22:03Z,"any working on LDS 767 for FSX????

Thanks !!"
,Frank Forthright,2007-06-09T22:07Z,"Oh C'mon now children, let's not fight over piracy rights. Isn't it funny how everyone who uploads here is so quick to point a vericose veined finger at copyright holders, saying ""Copyright BAD!"", but then those same people turn right around and get angry when another pirate pirates an item first pirated by someone else. haha  I love it."
,Sangeki,2007-06-09T22:09Z,"huh?

This here is about claiming a release for yourself instead of saying that you got it from somewhere else if that's the case here."
,Blade213,2007-06-09T22:11Z,Much appericated. Will Seed
,N537JB,2007-06-09T22:30Z,"So, 4X, and Sangeki, from where should I have gotten these things? I'm not a VIP @ WoS, and I do not own a usenet account, so please, please my friends, tell me ;)"
,Sangeki,2007-06-09T22:34Z,I didn't say that what 4X is saying is actually the case so that's between you two. ;-)
,Sangeki,2007-06-09T22:53Z,"Muzlumkillah, some people have that problem on the official forum as well... I haven't seen a real solution but your best chances are over there."
,N537JB,2007-06-09T22:55Z,"You both said that I wasn't the releaser/supplier, which I was, but ye ye, complain how much u want, I know what I released, and that's it!"

,pilatuspilot,2007-07-04T05:15Z,"Some of these comments are just amazingly childish and nonsensical.
""There's no honor amongst thieves."" So I don't expect many of the people downloading and sharing to be on the highest level of civility. But some discussions and comments on this site have gone the way of pure idiocy.
It's like a pirate ship where all the pirates are fighting amongst themselves the ship becomes coral bound.
What a funny funny funny place, if it wasn't so pathetic.
Thanks for the sharing N537HB, and to whomever got all of this together for us, thank you."
,str1ker-,2007-09-19T16:36Z,"thanks for uploading, but there is one problem:  there r 5 peers right now, all at 100%, but i aint getting anything.  im still on 0Bytes..."
