,odinrlives,2011-05-20T09:44Z,"Advanced PDF Password Remover is a small and easy-to-use tool to decrypt protected Adobe Acrobat PDF files, which have ""owner"" password set, preventing the file from editing, changing, printing, selecting text and graphics and copying them into the Clipboard, or adding/changing annotations and form fields.  Also It can remove the user/open password which protects the PDF files from opening if you know the password. Decryption is being done instantly. Decrypted files can be opened in any PDF viewer without any restrictions. All versions of Adobe Acrobat (including 9.x, which features 128-bit encryption) are supported.

,dark8218,2011-10-27T03:31Z,"I wrote a batch file to make it easier to run. Copy the information as noted below, using the first line just above it as a file name (which tells you what it does). The .bat is important! DO NOT LEAVE IT OUT. As long as it's in the same directory as the program and PDF, it should work fine.

That line should read as below.
