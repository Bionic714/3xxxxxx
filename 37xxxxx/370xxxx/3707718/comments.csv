,jersson,2007-06-10T21:08Z,"Thanks Christley, you seem to be a swell guy.

However I downloaded Your vers of Your Uninstaller vers 3.0.0.358 and the serial is to short. There are 4 digits missing on the serial attached so I have a trial vers right now.
Will you see to that and extend the serial so it does work.

Thanks in advance
