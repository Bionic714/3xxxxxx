,rperron,2007-06-16T13:29Z,"How do I get TT6 to recognize a new map?  I have TT6 installed on my Palm 700wx and it is running great.  But I can only see the map it came with.  I have loaded the folder of the new maps I would like to use to the root directory of the SD card, but TT won't recognize the new map.  Any ideas? Thanks"
