FLAC is a lossless codec used for making perfect 1:1 copies of audio CDs.
Lossless means an exact copy of the original CD without any loss of quality.
Unlike MP3, which is lossy and destroys the audio data to make the files smaller.

FLAC compresses the size, but it does NOT destroy any of the audio data or quality.
It works like a .RAR archive, which you can extract back to .WAV if you want to.

To extract it back to .wav, use the FLAC Frontend program and press decode.

You can play them directly in Winamp, Foobar2000 and even VLC.
