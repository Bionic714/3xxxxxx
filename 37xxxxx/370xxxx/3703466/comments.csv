Also check out ""Rise of the Police State"" (made in 2005) and ""The Road to Tyranny""(made in 2002).

Very good films, highly recommended.

Here's an awesome radio program http://www.nfowars.net:443/stream1.pls

Opens in Winamps and streams automatically! :)"

thnx. :o"

If TPB is right, I'm the only one left seeding this.

I'll keep it going as long as humanly possible, but people need to seed these themselves after they have it."

But TPB isn't always right."
