TESTED AND WORKS .

CURRENTLY THE EXT ROM IS FOR 6340....
THE IT.IMG CONTAIN THE STUFF (header) TO BE CHANGED
IN ORDER TO GET OTHER 6300 SERIES TO WORK...

MAIL NAMOFU@HOTMAIL.COM FOR A NEW IT.IMG 
if using other versions

currently on a hard reset.. the ext rom is not really anywere to be found
in the explorer..... im using resco with registry editor to UNHIDE the ext rom..
it takes knowhow
OR IF YOU FOR SOME REASON IS DUMB AND NOT USING THE SAME TOOL AS ME :-) RESCO EXPLORER
THEN IV INCLUDED A FILE CALLED REGEDIT.EXE WITCH CAN EDIT THE 
REGISTRY TO UNHIDE THE EXT ROM...copy the regedit.exe file to your device 
and edit the key below yes u do that your self :-)
My Device
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/sYSTEM/STORAGEMANAGER/PROFILES/TRUEFFS_DOC1
delete MOUNTFLAGS  ... yes go ahead .

if not so handy with registry editing then install resco explorer and reg plugin
iv included the reg file called unhide.reg copy it to your ppc and klik on it
then reset

the ext rom can not be edit with the ppc dont ask WHY
this is why we have to make the rom os self
this is howto do it all.

first all files have to be on c:\\ghost 
iv included 3 bat 

1. bat install the shit ! remember to reboot after this first bat!

2. bat file mount a drive on your computer called Z: 4 mb..
this is the rom we make before we put it inside the device

3. bat file unmount the Z: drive and make the ghostit.nbf ext rom file

4. it a modifyed hp rom update tool to update your rom finally

ps iPAQ File Store is not deleted/edited after the ext rom update
only a new modded ext rom on 4 mb has been unhidden 
but a hard reset WILL happend when updating

iv cooked this shit in a easy to use pack 
dont mail me with stupid questions about howto .. its rigth here
only the header questions and it.img

tips
making a folder in the root of the rom called Config , 
can be used to auto intall cab files ... 
just input the cabs in this folder and they will install 
them self on a hard reset

tips
editing the splash screen fucks the picture up good :-)
delete it instead :-o yes nothing bad happends

tips
editing the hard reset RES dir gif file is ok !
