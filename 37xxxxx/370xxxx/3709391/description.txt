There is a notorious forest adjacent to Mt. Fuji that attracts many young people to commit suicide every year. According to one local report, most of their bodies had never been found. The story begins in this mysterious forest where a criminal has abducted the Prime Minister's daughter. He took the girl to the forest, where he raped and murdered her. After a dedicated investigation, a suspect, ERIC, was soon arrested. However, the prosecution has been unable to prove his guilt, due to insufficient forensic evidence. No DNA proof can be obtained since a condom was used during the intercourse.
