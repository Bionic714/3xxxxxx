,Dagor_88,2007-09-15T03:43Z,This looks like an excellent compilation and I would greatly appreciate it if you could seed this! :)
,TYHThanatos,2007-12-01T18:23Z,Wow...I am really impressed with the seeders for this download... I just opened it a few seconds ago and I am already at 1%
,Seladora,2007-12-26T12:59Z,"Where are the rest?  This torrent is missing Unplugged in New York (1994) and Nivana (2002) as well as all of the singles packages.  You can't call it a ""Complete"" discography unless you have ALL of the albums released."
,superhenk,2008-03-04T17:56Z,"u guys, u shouldt care about how long it takes, it will be good in the end anyway"
,anyanita,2008-06-13T13:01Z,SEED PLEASE!!!!!!
,xXjl23Xx,2008-10-21T22:41Z,Seed please? :)
,spankyblu,2008-11-08T10:17Z,please keep seeding
,rocketjump,2009-03-16T14:14Z,Don't write complete if it isn't complete..
,mookitty92,2009-06-10T17:16Z,This does have Unplugged.  It also doesn't matter if it has the 2002 album because it's just all older songs.  There's only 1 new song and you can easily get it from Limewire (like I did) or whatever else you people may use.
,ChickenEater,2009-12-17T22:03Z,And that one new song is in this pack anyway.
