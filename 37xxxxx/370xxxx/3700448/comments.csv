,ETB_of_the_INS,2009-02-02T00:38Z,"Be forewarned that this download includes both Evanescence songs AND songs from Scorn's album entitled ""Evanescence."" The fact that Scorn has an album called ""Evanescence"" has been the cause of some confusion, and bootlegged versions of Ev's ""Origin"" album, for instance, sometimes include some of the Scorn tunes. 

In any case, the only Ev song from this download that I was glad to have is ""Surrender,"" which I had never found on any other download. It's not a great song, but worth having for Ev completests. (FYI, the other demos and such in this ""Evanescence by blondu4all"" download are available in better-compiled downloads. See, for instance, the self-titled Evanescence EP, which contains most of the Ev songs in the blondu4all download.)
