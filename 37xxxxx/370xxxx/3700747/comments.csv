,fog80,2007-07-08T18:30Z,"It works great...except for the text to speech. I got the mp3 and picture capability on my tomtom 700 but I cant get the text to speech to work. I've tried a lot of different voices (standard english) and it doesnt work.

The install was easy however, all I had to do was unzip the contents into the tomtom hard drive."
