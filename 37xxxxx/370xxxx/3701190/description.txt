Posada Carriles terrorism Made in USA


This Documentary Series reveals the "other story" of the relations of the US governments with Latin America. It is not the "official" Washington story, nor is it a "convenient" story for many governments of the hemisphere. It is the story that the Latin American peoples have been writing to this date, in their struggle for sovereignty. The Series is a tool for that struggle, and it is also a homage to those who have fallen.
