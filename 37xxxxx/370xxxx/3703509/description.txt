Some of the best freeware games that are published out there.

Torrent includes :

Chicken VS. Road : Very funny. You try to pass a road as a chicken.

The Blob : Nice 3D RPG game.

GameBiz Tycoon 2 : Good Stategy-kind game. You run a game publishing and creating company.


Cholo : Futuristic 3D Rpg game. Graphics are not that good but it\'s worth downloading.

McDonald\'s : Yes, that\'s right, it\'s the known flash game with McDonald\'s, but in a .exe format. For anyone that doesn\'t know the game, it is actually a parody of McDonalds (or not) in which you try to run McDonald\'s tourself. Very funny, though 2D, game.

Ray Hound (RayHound) 0.80 : It is NOT a BETA version. You control a spacecraft which has a strong magnetic field and you try to reverse the other spacecrafts firearms. Very realistic and worth-playing game.

P.S. : Freeware games are not illegal and I know that there are alternative sources for them all over the internet, but please don\'t post these alternatives if you know any. Ohh, and also, THIS IS NOT A VIRUS!
