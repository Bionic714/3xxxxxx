,muzza168,2007-10-10T07:05Z,"if i play this in winamp i get sound and no video
and in Zoom i get video and no sound...

can anyone suggest a player for pc that can play .mp4 ?"
,Sseverus,2007-10-10T21:10Z,"Muzza168, I suggest Quicktime player,It's great for all those mp4 movies that you can have on your Ipod. The sound works and the video as well. 

I will also suggest VLC player for those who just have Windows media player. (this has nothing to do with the mp4 question you had :P ) Before VLC I played all my movies on Windows Media Player. Half of the movies sounds didn't work so I thought there were something wrong with the movie but it was WMP. "
,muzza168,2007-10-11T01:16Z,"it appears i'm missing the audio codec ""mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC""

Tried to find a copy but seems like you have to buy it. anyone know where i could get it? Oh, the video works on VLC player, half way there :)"
,muzza168,2007-10-11T01:36Z,"actually all working. Helps to plug your speakers in :P
VLC player did the job. Thanks"
