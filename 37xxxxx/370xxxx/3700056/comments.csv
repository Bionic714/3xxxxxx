,atomicrabbit,2007-06-29T17:46Z,"just to let everyone know, symantec antivirus ce is reporting the following as viruses. I assume because they are uses to get passwords from the operating system, but I'm not sure...

setup.exe from Proactive.Password.Auditor.v1.61.incl.crack
setup.exe from Proactive.System.Password.Recovery.v4.1"

This torrent looks very similar to another one posted by the same guy and that one has a bunch of problems.  A bunch of trials and some have serials, but not all."
,jewishman,2009-02-19T00:15Z,Works fine all serials included and no trials
,Pirumyan,2009-07-27T14:06Z,Does it work on vista?
,dlmax63,2010-06-01T17:16Z,"Thanks for the up and seeds.

Works fine on Windows (x64) but NIS Sonar picks up a ""tool"" for removal. I ignored and have had no problems.

Very useful tools...I'll definitely keep in my archives for future use!"
