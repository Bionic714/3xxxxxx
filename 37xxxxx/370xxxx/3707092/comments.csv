,madv1lla1n,2007-09-06T00:52Z,"wampa_one, you must be like one of those racist deep south boys who happen to also like watching interacial porn...perhaps its the big black dicks you like so much!"
,madv1lla1n,2007-09-06T00:59Z,"SandAlaphon, not that I've seen this particular video, but Daft Punk's videos paid particular homage to the Battle of the Planets type animation of the 80's rather that the Akira generation of the 90's. I'm not going to subject you to any(more) geek jizz, but check out some of this earlier stuff, it's pretty cool if somewhat kitsch."
