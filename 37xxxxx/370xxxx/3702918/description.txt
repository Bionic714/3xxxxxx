Tracklist:

We Were Dancing - In A Simulated Sense Of Loss [hwemnet001]


Quote:
Inspired by everyday situations and faded memories of total happiness, We Were Dancing uses distorted sounds, noise and lo-fi field recordings to create rare little soundscapes. Music for 06 and beyond!

Kaburu  - If He Is; We Are Not [hwemnet002]


Quote:
After releasing hours of free music on the internet and playing several shows at venues ranging from art museums to punk clubs it is now time for their first official release. With this 30-minute free-form piece entitled \"If he is; We are not\" they are playing with conventional conceptions of art, human nature and the world.

Militant Fields / We Were Dancing / Dead Letters Spell Out Dead Words  - 80.39 [hwemnet004]


Quote:
Hwem is re-releasing Militant Fields 80.39 EP together with remixes from Dead Letters Spell Out Dead Words, We Were Dancing and Militant Fields himself. 80.39 has been described as a hiccup of the Eraserhead soundtrack. Slow panning soundscapes inhales and exhales. Rumbling noise tells stories of unhappy times.

We Were Dancing  - Mixtape Vol. 1 - We Won\'t Get Old [hwemnet005]


Quote:
On \"Mixtape vol.1 - we won┬┤t get old\", We Were Dancing continues to explore soundscapes built of distorted sounds and lo-fi field sessions. This release should really be listened to in the crappiest little boomblaster you can find. Hi-Fi is for the bourgeois!

Martin Herterich - Recordings 070401-070521


Quote:
\"On this record, I wanted to explore the possibilities of the grand piano as a droning instrument. By pitching, timestretching and processing piano samples, I sometimes try to make the piano sound more like a bowed string instrument. But the record is also supposed to be a snapshot, taken a cloudy day somewhere near a harbour.\" - Martin Herterich

2 Slow Dance (4:41)
