fao: mrb117; so far, of the dubbing I have seen across europe, only the french bother to actually have the dubbers shared the same voice as the original; all the other I heard, even the locals told me they use the same dubbers for most films; but yes, dubbing is a disgrace; comedy, drama, action, no matter the genre, idiomatic language can't have local correspondence all the time.
E.g., The Mask, how do you translate ""freeze""?; officers in denmark, poland, portugal, don't say freeze; so, I wonder how they got away with The Mask going ice frozen"
