,bwpow,2008-04-05T05:11Z,"Ok, so this torrent is dual audio (japanese + english) and has english soft subs. Description should be corrected."
,Turnoz,2008-04-09T05:13Z,If you could tell me how to edit i would be glad to. Idk why it says spanish.
,Thalinor,2008-12-06T17:27Z,"Thank you for the upload.  Is this using the shitty vorbis OOG for audio?  

Why?  I am tired of not being able to rip these fucking mkv's into DVD's because of the vorbis bullshit codec.  All other mkv's are np, just the ones that use vorbis audio. FUCK VORBIS OOG's!"
