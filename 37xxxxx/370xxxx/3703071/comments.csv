,CyborgSuperman,2008-05-09T03:14Z,"3astUpRoaR is wrong but it's cool. The title of the first album is 'House of Pain'. It 'IS' the first release. I own ALL their music, the albums and the remixes too. 'House of Pain' is the debut album from House of Pain, Released: July 21, 1992. The logo on the cover, which reads ""Fine Malt Lyrics"", is often referred to as the name of the album but is IS NOT. The 'Fine Malt Lyrics' is part of the House of Pain logo. It's on ALL their gear from back in the day."
