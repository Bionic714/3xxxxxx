,AMD freak,2007-07-12T09:27Z,"How did you get this to work? Some more info would be appreciated.
Do I use .reg patch 1st before I install WMP11?
I have tried lot's of this crap and mostly bugz or don't work at all. sad but true....
Thanx"
,AMD freak,2007-07-12T09:39Z,"dload this torrent
double click on .reg file
Install WMP11
100% working :)
Thanx fella"
,#1miglet#1,2007-07-13T11:59Z,Sorry for not giving more info but you got it anyway. First reg then WMP11
,AMD freak,2007-07-14T18:21Z,"Check this out peeps ....

After I  ran .reg patch & installed WMP11 I was finally able to Install IE7 :)
This .reg file must have helped because I tried a few other ways to install IE7 but it still didn't pass WGA validation.
It's installed and everything works 100%

Thanx again"

,hsm01,2007-08-24T22:41Z,Very good. Works perfect. Even after downloading from Windows site and validation from windows. Windows first denied and after the reg key it was OK. Thanks
,maxbrutal,2007-10-02T11:20Z,I can´t get it to work. I´ve opened the .reg file and then ran the installation but it says it´s not valid. Any ideas?
