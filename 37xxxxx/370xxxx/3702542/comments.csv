,xiIix,2008-08-13T00:06Z,"This game is fucking horrible dude. These ""extreme trux"" hardly break 25mph, and that's with a 100% savegame with all trucks and cups too. Who could play this game and actually have fun? I guess this is one of those ones you have to play when it came out in order to get nostalgia out of it because I can't find any joy in this at all."
