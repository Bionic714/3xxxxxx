,Ianpbx,2008-03-26T18:35Z,"Ok I've figured out what's wrong with this. It plays ok on PC but goes completely wrong on DVD player. The files on here have been messed about with. Consequently, when I remove the piracy trailer, the opening movie menu skips past and subtitles are not available. This needs to be submitted again with no editing."
