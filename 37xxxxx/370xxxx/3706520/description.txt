The original DVD contains 4 audio tracks.  2 stereo and 2 in 5.1 Dolby.  There are two of each because the audio includes the original mix by Bob Casale plus an alternate mix by Big Round Sound Productions.  I have included the 2 stereo sound tracks.  If you like the concert or you want the 5.1 Dolby sound tracks please buy the DVD.
   
Audio track 1 is the mix by Bob Casale
Audio track 2 is the mix by Big Round Sound Productions
