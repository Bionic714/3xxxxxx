INFO : 
[***] FAELIVRIN - 2007 [***][An ambiental soundscape...a tribute] My first album i want to dedicate to Faelivirn the one and the only, an elven girl who died forgotten by elves and mortal alike, the girl that has casted on me her spell. A girl that is very special for me from several different reasons. Just listen maybe You will find deep within the music the reasons why i adore her so much or just listen to the story about her tragedy forgotten so long ago...
