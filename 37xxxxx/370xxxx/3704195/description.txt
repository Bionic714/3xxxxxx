In short these are 2 hidden gems. Even after 20 years, these movies kept their humour.
Torrent of one of these was active (and still is) for over two years, shows how popular it is.



1 - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080801/ - The Gods Must Be Crazy (1980)

A Sho in the Kalahari desert encounters technology for the first time--in the shape of a Coke bottle. He takes it back to his people, and they use it for many tasks. The people start to fight over it, so he decides to return it to the God--where he thinks it came from. Meanwhile, we are introduced to a school teacher assigned to a small village, a despotic revolutionary, and a clumsy biologist.



2 - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097443/ - The Gods Must Be Crazy II (1989)

Xixo is back again. This time, his children accidentally stow away on a fast-moving poachers' truck, unable to get off, and Xixo sets out to rescue them. Along the way, he encounters a couple of soldiers trying to capture each other and a pilot and passenger of a small plane, who are each having a few problems of their own.
