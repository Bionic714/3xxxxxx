,muzikphan,2008-03-30T09:31Z,Many thanks.
,fluffyundertaker,2009-07-17T18:50Z,I downloaded it but I can't figure out how to get the subtitles and the English version working.
,stenare,2010-04-09T09:29Z,"Fear not, I'll seed this for quite some time once it's done downloading! I'm currently at 99,8% and I have seeded about 10 times the size of the Torrent already.

The main problem with these Torrents are that they're very popular for some time, then some ppl. starts to DL them using some slow (Think syrup) connection, and all the others finish except the sluggish dudes, and newcomers have to DL from the slugs. That's why there's so many peers and so very few seeds!

And that's also why I'll be kind enough to seed this so that other might be able to download this in reasonable time.

I'm counting that it'll be done today or tomorrow (ninth or tenth of April 2010)

Also, for you others out there; This does have over 100 peers, not 7 (Says so right now)!"

I't impossible to shut off the fucking subtitles, of which there's only one that, apparently, works which is annoying fucking retarded fucking spanish-fuck-language!!!

You can't just simply start the fucking movie, but you'll have to enter the menu and choose FUCKING ENGLISH in order to fucking hear it since it's not fucking available in the fucking subtitle-menu!!!

Fuck a fucking fucked fucking duck-fuck what a fucking retard-fucker that fucking made this fucking DVD-fuck!!!!"
,barton101,2012-08-04T00:57Z,"Next time, please include English subtitles for the hearing impaired. They are also good for people who don't have English as their first language. Subtitles take up hardly any extra space and they make for more seeders because the torrent is useful to more people."
