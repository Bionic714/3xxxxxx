,daggitenator,2007-09-29T02:01Z,"wishmaster, this movie was NOT advertised as ""I Am Legend"", dumbass.

This movie is pretty damned good for it's age.. also, if you're looking for ""I Am Legend"" stop being so fucking stupid, and wait until the thing comes out in theaters first, D'OH!
(which isn't until mid-December, a full 6 months after you made your post. haha, you fucking idiot.)

another remake of this movie, as credington advertised, is The Omega Man"
,massdestruction,2007-11-06T17:37Z,"does any one read books?!?
this movie is based upon a cult book writen 53 years ago by Richard Matheson and of course it is b/w!
PLEASE DON'T BE STUPID!!!

,AudibleSilence,2007-11-12T06:29Z,Honestly...some of you are uneducated at best and fucking retarded at worst.

,rajaoui,2007-11-26T18:09Z,what kind of quality is it
,metal1633,2007-11-26T20:11Z,"It looks and sounds like an old movie. Not just an old movie, but  an aging movie. It has not been ""Digitally Enhanced"" or ""Re-Mastered"". It has pops and scratches and such.

,fanzy,2007-11-27T23:29Z,hi hi 
,metal1633,2007-11-28T01:27Z,"matrix-191. Though you have the right to your opinion and no one will try to force you to like the movie, it is, nonetheless a subjective opinion. The objective reality is that this movie is a seminal masterpiece and was the inspiration behind ""Night of the Living Dead"" and thus Every Single brain eating zombie movie made since.

God Bless Roger Corman. I think I am going to start work on ""Attack of the Giant Leeches"".(If I can get it). It may take a few weeks."

,commenthatersblowme,2007-12-03T16:54Z,"thanks for the great upload metal1633! i sure hope ""i am legend"" can live up to the other two greats.

here's my impression of every other comment...
""wa wa wa wa i am an idiot. wa wa wa""

pretty good. i know. =)"
,xiIix,2007-12-08T11:54Z,Comments shouldn't even be allowed on here anymore. You're all fucking stupid ass-hat retards with an IQ lower than room temperature. This movie is a classic and Vincent Price is the shit.
,Jalockin,2007-12-09T00:56Z,"to SHKAN..... those people you talk about should have the ability to survive if such an event, like in the film, occurs - as zombies only eat brain ;D"
,bahamutnyne,2007-12-09T02:08Z,"b/w movies r lame any of thema nd tha actors theyre all underskilled compared to most ""good"" actors. the good actors from back then cant be compared to now a days actors im not sure why im stating this i just dont like old black and white movies even the remakes r 10 times better than the originals and this is no exception so far the trailers alone for i am legend make it look like it and golden compass r gonna be tha best of tha year which might i add that was a very dirty move waiting til the end of the year"
,freddym3rc,2007-12-09T19:47Z,"I searched for this specific movie and see a bunch of kids slamming it because it's B&W or mono sound or whatever. (Citizen Kane, Thing from Another Planet, Casablanca, etc. would suck by those metrics)

This one is a classic and well worth getting. 

PROTIP: CGI does not a good movie make. Look at all the ""modern"" remakes that suck bag. 

Enjoy being retarded, not knowing how to read, and going through life with a 30 second attention span."
,metal1633,2007-12-12T01:04Z,"Despite all the complaints (thank you for taking time to post BTW) this is the most popular torrent I have uploaded. For a movie this old to continue to cause so many strong feelings is proof in itself. This movie is classic.  I am still seeding. 6 months and counting. Feel free to make copies and give it to friends as a Christmas present. It is, after all, in the public domain. No MPAA to worry about. (rat bastards)"
,OdysseusPrime,2007-12-15T17:42Z,"Looking forward to screening this. Thanks much. 

Also, does anyone know/HAVE the torrent for ""The Landlord"" directed by Hal Ashby 1970???

I can't seem to find this anywhere. 

Appreciate."
,minm33,2007-12-16T03:09Z,thanks i been looking for this for awhile!
,Cazdoc,2007-12-18T02:14Z,"oh my god haha, i came on here to have a little look at the posts ABOUT THIS movie n got some kids arguing over a torrent comment page. well... i was going to download it"
,xalabam,2007-12-19T16:05Z,"it is not the wrong movie mate, dont be silly."
,arseface,2007-12-24T20:29Z,Thanks for this.
,Xarathos,2007-12-31T20:46Z,Thanks for this classic.
,Chickpea,2008-03-30T08:19Z,Made over 40 years ago in B/W and still FAR SUPERIOR to the crappy Will Smith rubbish film.
,bloominidiot,2008-04-14T21:11Z,"Thank you, metal1633"
,Wapoochee,2008-04-30T19:14Z,"Nice film but as metal mentioned the quality is pretty bad. I have this DVD and the quality is much better than this. 

Maybe there is a DVD rip somewhere..."
,metal1633,2008-05-19T05:24Z,Wow. People are still downloading this and seeding. Very cool. Guess I Picked a good one to upload. As to the quality. It is not a dvd rip (obviously) I did not encode it either. It is a in the public domain and I found a copy in an online archive. It appears to have been converted from a copy made for television and has been run through a deinterlacing filter which made it blurry.  I have never uploaded one of my own rips (pristine quality if I say so myself) because every dvd I have is already here. What would be the point really..
,Schnabel81,2008-06-20T13:40Z,Great upload metal. Thanks! :)
,CosmicKeys,2009-11-27T09:04Z,"My god some of the people posting on this torrent are a disgrace, those worms don't deserve the privilege of a VP film. 

To metal1633, cheers bro great upload."
,the_dv_guy,2010-03-08T17:01Z,"WT? ... metal1633 thanks for the upload. I haven't even finished downloading this torrent yet but had to take the time to comment on the ridiculous nature of the kiddy posters in the top of the thread.

They don't realize that lots of the older classics are either locked up and decaying in some vault or even totally lost. If it weren't for torrents like these we wouldn't even get a chance to see the this good classic with its purportedly ""terrible"" picture quality. As far as I am concerned it is what it is and better than nothing. If you have a better quality copy then stop whining and post it otherwise shut the H??? up and move on.

metal1633 ... Ignore those fools ... keep torrenting these classics. Their turn will come when their kids will be telling them Britney Spears et al are all crap (and they would be right)  but then suggesting their own lame replacements of the day.

The cycle is viscous so no need to get all upset over it, so let me calm myself back down and enjoy this classic when the download is over.

Cheers."
,Sven the swede,2010-03-11T22:54Z,"This looks like the video was recorded with a camera on a cinema! I'm not kidding, quality is that bad. "
,infogo,2010-09-20T12:45Z,"I see this was uploaded three years ago, nice that its still seeded.

Alternative download from archive.org: archive.org/details/the-last-man-on-earth

Thanks metal1633 for this classic.
