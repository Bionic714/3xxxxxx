Some people who live inside the US wish to speak anonmously, and since we don't quite have 100% free speech, TPB can provide that.  This is a human rights issue having to do with child torture, and a corrupt advocate who, in this letter, is proved to refer (by proxy) to what basically account to concentration camps.

,spy2k6,2007-06-07T10:28Z,"Michelle died on day 7 of what was to be a 63-day program.  Michelle collapsed and died of dehydration due to exposure to the elements on a dirt road in Arizona.  Our daughter laid on the dirt for 22 hours as the surviving kids lit three fires to summon help.  A sightseeing aircraft spotted the survivors and called for help.  After Michelle died, we traveled to the place where she died.  As I walked the dirt trail leading to the place Michelle died, I could feel the gentle wind blowing in my face and sucking the moisture right out of my body. I got thirsty just walking about a hundred yards.  I can only imagine what my child suffered as she hiked up and over MT. Dellumbaugh that day.  Michelle?s best friend in High School was Andrea Dawes.  Andrea was in the Summit Quest Program along with Michelle.  Andrea stuck up for Michelle as the female counselor kept saying Michelle?s symptoms were all in her head.  This female counselor treated Michelle badly.  Andrea tried to convince the counselors that Michelle was not faking.  On the day Michelle died, the group had run out of water.  Michelle was begging for water.  She was having a lot of trouble with the hike up and over MT. Dellumbaugh.  Andrea took the risk of having her own water poured out, or taken away, as she slipped capfuls of water to her dying friend Michelle.  The program had a rule about sharing water.  The kids could not share!  The Summit Quest Program Director, Gayle Palmer, later claimed on national TV that this rule was for HEALTH REASONS!  Andrea is married now and has children of her own.  She named her first little girl after Michelle.Michelle died on day 7 of what was to be a 63-day program.
