,ThaiWhip,2007-06-03T20:49Z,"Sorry, disregard my last comment.. wrong torrent.. :/"
,Suzy.hansen,2007-06-04T22:29Z,Easy now - it will come - just give me some time.
,BOMM2,2007-06-05T14:06Z,"Der er noget galt.
Er der åbnet for indgående forbindelser i firewallen på den port Azureus bruger? - Eller hvis du sidder bag en router, er den port Azureus bruger forwardet til den computer hvor Azureus kører på?
Hvis du seeder en masse data til en eller to, så dræb dem - resten af sværmen sidder med 0,6% efter 36 timer..."
,gave1,2007-06-10T14:16Z,Seeding needed; this torrent is not happening at the moment.
,wisii,2007-06-21T13:06Z,"Er du stoppet med at seede ? Har hængt på i 18 dage, og står på 71,7 &"
,wisii,2007-06-28T07:29Z,"Nu er den på 93,8 %, er den stoppet ?"
,gave1,2007-06-29T15:44Z,"Unable to expand. Corrupt rar-files.

Disappointing."
,tequila68,2007-06-29T15:57Z,I got corrupt files also. The .iso will not open
,tor2,2007-06-29T17:31Z,"Det samme her,får ikke åpnet filen."
,Suzy.hansen,2007-06-29T20:06Z,":-((

,gave1,2007-06-29T20:27Z,Why don't you just upload the video.ts folder from the dvd?
,gave1,2007-06-29T20:28Z,"And, of course, your efforts are greatly appreciated!"
,Suzy.hansen,2007-06-29T22:33Z,"Hey Gave1

Because I want you to make at DVD with the original Name on it.

Is it better with ONE file (The ISO)?

BTW: Thanks. :-)"
,gave1,2007-06-30T08:09Z,"Hi,
I guess it would be an idea to consult any of the torrent uploading guides on the net.
Good luck!"
,Suzy.hansen,2007-06-30T21:26Z,"Hey Gave1.

Come again!!!

YOU better tell me what you're unsatisfied with.
.
.
.

Do you have any links to a guide?"
,tor2,2007-07-01T07:20Z,Noen som har klart å åpne ???
,gave1,2007-07-01T08:52Z,"I just commented that the rar-files that you uploaded for this torrent were corrupted, and that it might be a good idea to upload it differently. How to do this is described in many guides on the net. I don't have any particular links, but it shouldn't be hard to find."
,Suzy.hansen,2007-07-02T00:18Z,"Hey Tor2

Nope... the RAR files IS corrupt.

I'm gonna make a new torrent soon.

For all your others - don't bother downloading.
