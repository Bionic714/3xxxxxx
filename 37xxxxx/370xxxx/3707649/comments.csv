Go download porn, watch wrestling and drink budweiser. 

And don't forget to wave the flag to try to forget that your grand-parents came from europe where they were cold, hungry and eating rats during WWII. 

Most importantly, do not download any of my files that you can easily recognize by the labelling that is bothering you.

The more stupid you remain, the happier I will be.  

Truth has spoken, so it shall be done."

Never judge a book by it's cover.
Download it, check it out quickly and if you don't like it, throw it :)

This era IS the info tech one, ain'it?

Respect! downloader77"
