there are a couple of things you should keep in mind:
1- this torrent is more or less for ETS users only, therefore the password makes sense.
2- to open .7z files you need any modern file archieve software. winrar or winzip should do, i believe.

no need to seed really (only if you feel like it).
unrar and enjoy.
