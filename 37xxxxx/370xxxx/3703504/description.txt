Trojan Remover 6.6.0Publisher's Description:
Trojan Remover was written to aid in the removal of Trojan Horses when standard anti-virus software has either failed to detect the Trojan Horse or is unable to effectively eliminate it. The majority of Virus and Trojan Scanners are well able to detect malicious Trojan Horses but are not always very efficient in removing them once they have been triggered.
