,tigerfish54,2007-06-28T16:04Z,Yes there`s a virus in the .exe file that installs mirc on your computer but it`s fake! You will get a question if you want Spoolsv to access to internet if youre using a firewall (Not windows build-in). It will replace the original Spoolsv.exe and it will slow down your computer cuse the process will use 100% of your CPU. I had to re-form my hardrive.
