The Episode:

""New Zealand - New Zealand's Maori gang culture.""

Was censored in New Zealand by the government.... Some thing they don't want us to see? Thanks for seeding!"
,lister_of_smeg,2008-10-04T18:21Z,does any one know what happened to the episode that was meant to be in Liverpool? it was on the adverts but doesn't look like its happened. 
,ilsardu,2008-11-11T15:35Z,"Excellent series but a warning on the South Africa episode: the last 5 minutes which is a 1on1 interview with the head of the numbers gang, is a very GRAPHIC and DISTURBING discussion on prison rape. I really wish I hadn't seen it. Keep this in mind when you watch it."
