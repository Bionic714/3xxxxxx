,sagartian,2010-02-04T16:14Z,"Thank you  very much for the great upload. I was looking for this movie for a long time... The quality is excellent (both V & A=10 assuming the small file size) , the movie itself consists of surprising chain of events; a good choice for syfy lovers especially people looking for robot based movies."
,almostfreebird,2010-04-26T16:41Z,"Very good quality!
I don't know much about technical thing but why 700MB 
can be so good. 
I thought huge Bytes is always better but it doesn't seem right.
Can somebody explain why?"
