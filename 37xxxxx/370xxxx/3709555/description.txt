Hi guys!

After the fact that FM 2007 have been released, there was a lot of files which were published by CFF and and other sites from rest of the world. Sometimes because of formatting our computer, we reload all of the files again and again, got tired, got bored and sometimes we reload them erroneously so that we lose our whole game. Events like them would happen. So, we have produced this superb work ,which contains the finest packs of the World, that will help you for your games. 

You should download this pack pals! This file that includes themes, facepacks, logo packs, utilities, trainings, tactics and kinds of stuff like these is sized 1.12 GB 

After downloading this file, there is no such a worry like downloading, setting up them step by step! One click, one solution! ( I\\\'ve felt like an ad producer  )

We send our thanks to our friends who has files in this perfect pack and who have helped us to produce this pack from entire World. Here are our friends:
