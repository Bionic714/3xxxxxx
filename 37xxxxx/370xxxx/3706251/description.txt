Plot Outline:
One of the most brutal killing sprees in the annals of American history becomes the feature film that's sure to keep viewers sleeping with the lights on as director Ed Gein: The Butcher of Plainfield Michael Feifer recounts the horrific atrocities committed by the notorious Richard Speck. It was the crime that shocked a nation; nine selfless Chicago nurses brutalized, raped, and murdered without mercy or remorse. The man responsible for the crimes - a lifelong criminal and high-school dropout whose petty early crimes would become increasingly ominous as the years went by. Parker Lewis Can't Lose and Stargate SG-1 star Corin Nemec portrays the notorious serial killer in a relentless account of real life events co-starring horror icons Andrew Divoff, Tony Todd, and Debbie Rochon. ~ Jason Buchanan,
