,xxxFRIARxxx,2007-06-07T21:07Z,"I hate how the top 100 is filled with this garbage.  There should be a TOP 100 ELECTRONICA if there are going to be this many fucking ""VA"" releases of some stupid shit that overseas motherfuckers like.  This webpage is mainly visited by USA residents.  USA residents don't like your shit.  We like FULL CD RELEASES, dumbass."
,James2k7,2007-06-07T22:14Z,"dude..  your saying no one likes it.. why is it so popular then?  im from UK and download many of these, like the other guy said, grow up ged a life and most of all dont complain, fag."
,uk_house,2007-06-07T23:06Z,What all this stuff bout  ELECTRONICA - this is a standard release of a CD?  We need far more of these
,James2k7,2007-06-08T14:17Z,"frair:  if the whole of the piratebay evolved around what you want, it would suck.. grow up n get a life..     if you looked at all the music this guy has put on here, you would think differently..  this guy rok, i will allways download dance/house releases from him..  he also does pop r & b and many more.. stop been lame and posting shit on all his torrents, grow up u faggot!"

,happygilmore_uk,2007-06-08T15:24Z,"I downloaded this by accident while looking for ministry of sound clubbers guide summer 2007, but i have to say, it is amazin! im not hugely into dance music but this stuff is class! Its Clubbers Guide to St Petersburg, I had problems with the tracks not playing and they aint named, couldnt get a list either, but there were 3 full album tracks on, so I just listen the whole way through the albums. As for the guys from the US if you dont like this then why click it, fuck off and go back to listenin to the beach boys!"
,happygilmore_uk,2007-06-08T15:25Z,"my bad, didnt look at the full name, this seems to be the cd i was originally looking for, downloaded one with a very similar name that is pretty good, so look out for it too, do the tracks on this one work?"
,James2k7,2007-06-08T19:45Z,"all the ones on this work, :)

lol @ beach boys"
,Zlap,2007-06-08T20:12Z,"xxxFRIARxxx I don't know but u guys in US still listen to your rock shit? What do they play at the clubs?

Dance 4 life!"
,ag3ntugly,2007-06-09T01:27Z,"xxxFRIARxxx: whatever genre of music it is you listen to is pebble laying next to the mountain that is ""electronica"", just because you and your in-bred backwoods snaggle toothed  boyfriend dont wanna hear anything without a fiddle or overly distorted guitar, doesn't mean I dont :-P"

There alot of artists in this album so it makes sence to put VA"
,xxxFRIARxxx,2007-06-11T17:57Z,"This is still garbage.

Get off the drugs.

I'm not snaggle-toothed (although your reply was awesome.  I'll give you credit for that).

I used to listen to some electronica...but then I got off the drugs.

I seed everything I get for twice the time it took me to download it.

So STFU and listen to something with substance, instead of ""boom, boom, boom, boom, boom""  (I'm dancing in a club and it' like a heartbeat!  I GET IT NOW!  WOW, I LOVE THIS STUFF!)"
,James2k7,2007-06-11T21:59Z,GO AWAY  lol.. no one gives a shit qwt u like or want.. look for wat u want.. iuits ovyius thatpeople like this stuff due to the amount of seeders/leechers... +  im not on drugs u fuckwit
,wfgovie,2007-06-12T19:58Z,"Friar Fuck is what you call the semi intelligent hick that thinks his community college ""edumacation"" makes his opinion worth while. If you don't like it why don't you upload something, or I know how about stop bitching about this torrent when it takes you 3 seconds to click away from it. And another thing if you don't like/didn't download this, then how come you posted on it so many times..  Get a life toolbag and don't forget to pull out of your sister... don't need any ignorant assholes like you running around the TPB. Choke on it bitch...  .:.XD.:."
,xxxFRIARxxx,2007-06-14T21:41Z,"My ""community college"" 'edumacation', as you so well put it, is apparently teaching me enough to stay in a thread and defend my opinions.  The ONLY reason I'm still posting on this is because I've pissed so many people off that they HAVE to write something back to me.  If you weren't replying, neither would I.  Your high school education definitely does NOT make your opinion valid either, ESPECIALLY if you think that:

A:  I'm a hick (I live above the Mason-Dixon, dickhole, and hate everything country)
B:  I'm a ""toolbag"" (I carry tools?  I know what you mean, but if you want to argue semantics...)
or 
C:  I fuck my ""sister""; of which I have none.

Maybe you need to go to a community college.  (I go to a REAL college, by the way.  None of that technical bullshit that you'll be enthralled in.  I like WHITE COLLAR work, not BLUE like your bum-ass)

The reason I came in here INSTEAD of ""not clicking on it"", is because I HATE THE WASTED SPACE of TPB that this bullshit-excuse for music takes up.

Eat a cock."

,td866,2007-06-15T14:32Z,friar is  STUPID american! the only reason this site exists is because its NOT american! the swedes started asshole and theh amaricans tried to shut it down. be grateful it's here! maybe only posts in swedish should be allowed on here to screen out most of the assholes.
,rajisuju,2007-06-16T18:33Z,"I have to add a comment here, cause I'm so embarrassed by this american brother of mine 'friar'.  He is the type of kid that makes americans look bad in the world.  His attitude is lame, and he doesn't have a right to start such negative comments which fueled the anger in this thread.  

Please know people that most american do love the genre: electronica (I personally love the subgenre: Progressive, House, Tribal, a little Trance, Breaks, DeepHouse, Ambient, and hate techno and minimal, but thats me and my taste and others can love it ... all is good to the one who loves what they like.)  I grew up on Pink Floyd ( the master beginners of Progressive imo, and LedZepplin, as well as the many ameican classic rockers, and I still love them by the way.)  So I say all this to hopefully to make a point to so many here who may judge my country by the ignorance of one loud mouth punk who only lives to stir up peoples emotions.  

He probably masturbates reading your comments and dreaming about how angry he has made all of you."

,HighSlayer,2007-10-05T02:12Z,"Friar - get back to your bedroom and carry on jacking off into a sock, instead of jacking off on this site.

There are thousands of torrents to suit all tastes. Choose the ones, you want, leave the ones you dont, and STFU

Comments should be about quality, seeds or problems not an opinion of the subject material.

As we say in England - Wanker!"
