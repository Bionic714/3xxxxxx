Lots of groove & really nice sounds here. Such a sweet finding!

Eclectic dark sinths, virtuosistic pianos, melodic vocal and bombastic guitars. I highly recomment it to any electronica & alternative rock fan. You wont be disappointed. A great album from a little known artist and a gem in is own!
