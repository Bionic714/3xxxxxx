There should be a TOP 100 ELECTRONICA if there are going to be this many fucking ""VA"" releases of some stupid shit that overseas motherfuckers like. This webpage is mainly visited by USA residents. USA residents don't like your shit. We like FULL CD RELEASES, dumbass."
,uk_house,2007-06-07T23:08Z,Again - this is a FULL CD release....
,B_Nazty,2007-06-09T13:37Z,"xxxFRIARxxx >> You dumb fuck, keep in mind that this is a s.w.e.d.i.s.h. tracker. If you google a bit, you might find some Garth Brooks-trackers in USA?"
,xxxFRIARxxx,2007-06-11T17:53Z,"I do NOT like Garth Brooks.  He is a tool.

Just like all of you who listen to this electronica garbage.

I don't give a fuck about what tracker it is.  Maybe you Sweeds should get your OWN webpage.  TPB is mainly used by USA citizens.  Go to www.sweedensucks.com or something."
,Maracuja,2007-06-12T13:56Z,"xxxFRIARxxx - If you don't like swedes why are you on a swedish website made by swedish people and run by swedish people?

Own webpage? Do you think USA citizens in some way have a bigger right to be here than anyone else?

Just because 99% of the population is USA don't have a clue about anything doesn't mean you have to prove it. We already know it.

I don't give a shit about this music thou, it's probarbly shit :)."
