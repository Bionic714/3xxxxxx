Hollywood bought up the official BitTorrent client and destroyed it.

Later, BitTorrent bought up uTorrent.

They're planning to implement DRM and all sorts of crap in all of the major torrent clients, including uTorrent and Azureus...

The last good (and safe) client to use is uTorrent 1600 (1.600) which was released before they sold out to hollywood and BitTorrent... but it's getting harder and harder to find it, so here's a torrent containing the 1600 setup.

Enjoy!

NEVER update!
