LOOOL!!!

Good one... Geez, what's wrong with you FAKE?

I've been using this exact version of uTorrent since it came out and (obviously) i never updated... and i've never ANY problems WHATSOEVER with it.

Good to see it on TPB btw. Suppose you could go to oldversion.com as well though, but, 'tis still a mighty nice torrent.

Maybe the ""new"" versions of the prog ""work"", but, why sleep with a pack of lions and hope they don't bite?? seems retarded, especially when you have the choice to be on the safe side instead..

Yeah, i would rather have good 'ole reliable 1.6.0.0"

,DarthBubba,2007-06-08T22:34Z,"The level of misinformation around here is proof that computers are just too easy to operate these days.  For those of you unwilling, or unable, to read the relevant news reports linked above:  There are measures being taken by the MPAA/RIAA to get DRM enforcement by having torrent clients refuse to distribute DRMmed files.  Much like recent versions of WMP won't play ""pirated"" music and/or movies.  If the torrent client sees the DRM flag set, it won't transfer the file.  An obvious defense against that approach is to use older torrent clients written before they were bought up by companies who will obey the DRM distribution directives of the MPAA/RIAA.

As to security exploits:  Don't any of you use firewalls (hardware or software based), anti-malware sniffers, or appropriate OS patches?

Better a tin-hat than a tall pointy hat with ""Dunce"" written on it."
,DarthBubba,2007-06-08T22:58Z,"For those of you that can actually understand:  From the actual code posted on milw0rm.com

This exploit hits XP SP1 (and earlier, I assume) and Windows 2000 SP1-SP4 via uTorrent.  XP SP2 is safe.  I still use XP SP1 and have used the ""compromised"" version of uTorrent since it came out, and have never seen this exploit used.  A Demo posted on milw0rm is not the same as an ongoing threat."
,EAGLE_HAWK,2007-06-09T03:00Z,"Bravo Dark-Alex You One in 100,000,000!!!

Is it possible that a lot of users aren't smart!?
DRM just started and will be problem for next generation. If you experience stoped or discreased download speed, or warning that ""windows failure to do delayed writing of that file and that data will be lost"", or percentage of downloading file is showing less that you know that realy is-THATS IT!!! So, say thanks to Dark-Alex and hurry to download this torrent while existing. It seems to be repeated story like Adaptec EZ CD Pro 2.1 a time ago, and you can't find it anymore on the internet. Please revew the DRM seriously! DRM=Digital Rights(Restriction) Management."
,DarthBubba,2007-06-09T04:24Z,"Good God this is getting tedious...

Bottom line: People who want to continue trading files/movies/songs need to continue using DRMless torrent clients.

Creating a DRM-aware torrent client is a marketing and distibution technique.  DRM-aware torrent clients will be used for buying DRM-impaired products from licensed distributors.  Your DRM-aware torrent client will allow you to receive whatever protected software from the swarm of people who are buying and downloading the same thing - thus speeding up distibution and taking some of the load off the distributor's servers.  Your copy will likely be watermarked to play only for your computer.  None of this is for your benefit; only the distributors are for this.

Sending DRM-impaired software to someone else, by whatever means, will be pointless - they won't be able to use/play it.  It is unlikely that DRM-aware clients will exchange anything with DRMless clients.  That defeats the intentions of the DRM-protected-software sellers.  The DRM-aware client may even report you to the MPAA/RIAA for using a DRMless client in an attempt to connect to a DRM-aware client for illicit purposes.  DRM-aware clients may also report you for trying to use them with a torrent obtained from Pirate Bay and other DRMless trackers.  Anyone remember Microsoft's WGA phone-home spyware when you installed SP2?  Anyone realize that XP installs an Alexa-type tracker to your system from the original CD?

This stuff is neither horses**t, nor tinfoil-hat thinking.  It's how the media business is changing to catch up with the internet.  The RIAA companies can no longer depend on places like Tower Records (now gone out of business) to distribute their products.  They probably don't like licensing Apple to distibute their products - Apple takes a cut of each sale.  I suspect that movies will go the same route sometime in the future.  The RIAA/MPAA companies want to control the whole chain, from manufacture to distribution to playback.  I can't wait to see them try to force us to pay for each playback/use of their product (Think about web-based applications).

WRT DRM-aware players:  How soon until WMP won't play anything that doesn't have YOUR DRM license number stamped on it?  This would negate grabbing a DRMmed movie and stripping off the protection then putting it out on PB.  I still use WMP9 - it doesn't seem to care what I play on it, as long as the right CoDec is loaded up.

Just a little plug:  Some of the Linux distributions are getting REALLY EASY to use.  I like Kubuntu the best right now, but am still testing other distros.  BTW, uTorrent works fine in Wine or Cedega under Linux.  Who cares about the security hole now?"

,Laej,2007-06-09T09:20Z,OK. Exactly HOW is the DRM-clients worse than the non-DRM clients? Do they steal bandwidth?

It's not very intelligent to assume that the new version is evil and out to get you, without any evidence."
