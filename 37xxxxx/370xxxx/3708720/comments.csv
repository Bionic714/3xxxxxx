Judging by the description, this is not it."
,ricardo000,2009-10-06T21:19Z,Could someone please seed?
,turdcrow,2010-05-01T21:26Z,"Sorry 9c7b5a, I know it' frustrating. I'll seed it for awhile if you'll seed it one more time. Sorry some people are such party poopers....."

Original length is 188, not 172 min. Wrong aspect ratio + letterbox. Subtitles menu doesn't work in some DVD-players."
