Pexet 07
Good quality DVD-rip

Includes:

* The performance "Peace, Love & Understanding"
* The movie "Crossroads 3"
* Extras

There are some problems with this release:

* There's no subtitles in the movie.
* There's no intro song i the performance.
* Micke did another clumsy mistake, in the final scene it goes repeat from about the middle of the performance.

To watch:

* Download.
* Unrar
* Mount on a virtual disk with Daemon Tools/Magic Disk.
* Enjoy the awesome Pex!
