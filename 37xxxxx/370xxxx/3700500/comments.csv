,isaha,2007-10-17T12:40Z,Could someone please seed?! I'm stuck at 93% ((( I promise to seed for at least one month!
,Zipang,2008-01-18T02:33Z,"i see people r mentioning somth. about the second disk, is this just a part of the film or...?"
,lumen66,2008-02-16T20:25Z,"thanks, suuuperb - my vote too for disc 2 if there is one :)"
[T],Artleo,2008-02-17T12:33Z,"The second disc is a DVD9 containing only copious extra material. As my bandwidth is quite poor, I think that choice between uploading a disc with extras or a disc with some new movie is obvious."
[T],minOdroL,2008-03-28T16:40Z,Thanks a lot for the upload!
,ArghMatey2006,2008-07-18T22:22Z,Thanks for this.  More people should release stuff like this! Especially for overpriced Criterions.  If only dual layer DVDs were not so expensive.
,neanderwill,2008-12-20T05:37Z,ntsc or pal?
,Damienom,2011-10-15T16:06Z,Can someone please reseed this?! I'm a Bowie Fan and I need to see this movie! I promise to keep this torrent alive when it is finally downloaded.
