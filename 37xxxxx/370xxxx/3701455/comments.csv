,peterinas,2007-05-31T17:09Z,pratar dom finska ?? vem har orkat göra om den då?. måste varit lättare med finsk text
,The_Avatar,2007-06-01T05:52Z,"The language is english, there are not anything finnish in this movie not even subtitles.

The quality is poor however. the picture is a bit unclear, it looks like the quality you would expect if the file was half the sice of this torrent. Also there are a lot of blurred out spots in the picture that are very anoying.

All in all it's better than an TS but far away from a proper DVD rip."
