IVM Voicemail Software
Complete voice mail solution for Windows
IVM is voicemail software for Windows PCs. This program can be used to create an effective voice mail solution from a single line after hours answering machine to a 64 line corporate system with thousands of voicemail boxes whether you have standard telephone lines or VoIP services.

Setting up a PC Voice mail system is easy. Download the software and install it on any Windows PC. For professional or multiline installations we recommend a telephony board to connect to the phone line(s). For home single line use a voice modem in the PC may be sufficient. VoIP services can be used to receive calls directly via the Internet or from a VoIP PBX without any special hardware.

The list of features follows but a quick way to see how IVM PC Voicemail system works is to download and install now. You don't need to purchase to download and it only takes a couple of minutes to complete the process (click here to install). After you have tested IVM and found it to be suitable, you can purchase a location license (click here to purchase).
