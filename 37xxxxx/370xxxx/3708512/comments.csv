,emb110,2007-06-10T00:57Z,"Same here, many of the text are missing help!!!"
,base2048,2007-06-10T06:17Z,May be the fonts are missing
,finnor69,2007-06-10T08:09Z,"The FMS uses 'Courier New'.

The MFD uses 'HW Arial', that's a custom font we created to look like the fonts used by Honeywell, the Installer puts it in your windows/font folder.

The rest of the fonts used are 'Arial'

XP SP2 doesn't have it, And looking for  'HW Arial'  font."
,base2048,2007-06-10T17:34Z,Is it possible to make rename a font to HW Arial? We'll have to know the file name of HW Arial. 
,macman4,2007-06-18T19:41Z,"flyboi708, any chance you  have the HW arial font. I need this font to be able to see text in the MFD.
Please Email it to me if you have it.
