Enrique Iglesias is gearing up for the June 12 release of
"Insomniac," his first album in three years.

Iglesias wrote all the songs on the bilingual album, which
includes collaborations with Sean Garret, Max Martin, John
Shanks among others.

The first single, "Do You Know? (The Ping Pong Song)" in
English and "Dimelo" in Spanish will be released to radio
next week and will be followed by a video to be filmed in
Los Angeles. As the name implies, the song starts out with
the rhythm of a ping pong ball hitting a table.

The album also includes the song "Push" featuring rapper
Lil' Wayne's first time collaborating on a pop track.
Iglesias' promotional blitz includes an appearance on "Two
and a Half Men" on May 7, "Dancing with the Stars" on May
15, the "Today Show" summer concert series on June 15, and
"Jimmy Kimmel Live" on a date to be announced.

The Grammy winner will also perform at the "Live Earth"
concert on July 7.

Iglesias has sold over 40 million albums worldwide. His
last album, "7" sold 394,000 copies in the U.S. according
to Billboard/Nielsen SoundScan.
