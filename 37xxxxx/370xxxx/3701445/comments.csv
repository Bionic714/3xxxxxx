maybe with your next torrent you give some more details about the program. "
,jimjabbo,2007-05-31T08:08Z,well I thought at 2 megs in size it wasnt going to be a sophisticated program and the first 5 or 6 attempts to create a torrent were unsuccessful so when it actually worked I was getting tired of doing it...oh well..next time...mumble...:)
