This utility is a replacement for the spyware-infested WinZix program.

Should you have been unfortunate enough to have downloaded a ZIX archive, this app helps you extract the contents.

Check the readme file and the FAQ first, okay?

News (version 0.0.7)
=====================
* Rewritten to handle multi-gigabyte ZIX archives.
* Almost certainly will not get confused by unknown metainformation
* Issues warnings about common hoaxes and virus-infected files
* Performs a basic check on AVI files in the archive, and reports if
  they are garbage (so you don't have to extract it).

Oh, and two things:

*   Please seed this for a while if you find it useful.

*   Don't keep seeding downloads which contain ZIX archives. Others who
    aren't as smart as you will be tricked into installing spyware.
    Better they shold be annoyed about dead torrents than be tormented
    by viruses and/or spyware. Show some cybermercy, would you?

Cheers!
