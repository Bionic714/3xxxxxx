Ninja - The Violent Sorcerer (Angela Mao, 1982)

Stephen Baker/Barker/Parker (the name is pronounced distinctly all three different ways) is aided by the magic of Taoist Collins, an expert in keung si, to cheat his way into becoming the Gambling King. He challenges Myer, a gambling master to a dice match with their lives as the stakes, and wins via cheating. Even though Stephen cheated, Myer keeps his word and shoots himself, much to the consternation of his son, Leslie. Rose Myer, the ghost of his wife, individually comes to her brothers-in-law, Roger (a ninja in white), and Ken (a nerdy ninja in green, who also disguises himself as a keung si and a Taoist priest at various points) and wants her husband's death avenged. Collins sends his keung si after the two of them, while Leslie Myer and his father's best friend seek out the help of James Webber, a master gambler who became an alcoholic after losing one time. After Leslie calls him a coward along with some unprintable words, Webber agrees to help, but not alone. H recruits his friend Anna, whom we find participating in a bar fight, and his friends Ricky and Lily, working as a stuntman and a purotechnician on a movie, respectively. These three combine their fighting and gambling prowess to send dice flying into walls and so forth. Meanwhile, Roger and Ken recruit Taoist West in helping them defeat the keung si, bringing along a grenade so they can deal with Mr. B or P, who is obviously in a different film from what they are in.
