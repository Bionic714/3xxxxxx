Do you have a Disc 2?"
,tygerbug,2007-06-06T09:21Z,"Yes, there is a disc 2. I'll post it shortly.

There are also a couple of PAL discs of the same material, but I won't be posting those.

If you want copies of any of these or other discs, email me at tygerbug at yahoo."
,Tattybogle,2007-06-10T18:29Z,"Just want to say this is a real labour of love and very much appreciated.

Do you have ""Sir Henry..."". I loaded down a svcd copy some time ago but the quality is mucho naffo.
Also want to say that there are a couple of ""Do Not adjust your set..."" compilations around on here for as wants em!
Thanks again."
,tygerbug,2007-06-10T21:07Z,"The Sir Henry film, which is terrible, was recently rereleased in a very crisp special edition DVD transfer, and can be bought. I do have it and short selections from it appear on disc 2 of this compilation.

10 episodes of Do Not Adjust Your Set are available on DVD and can be bought - I have two other episodes which are not available on DVD and you can see the Bonzo performances from them on this first disc.

   In both cases you might as well buy the commercially available discs.

   Again you can email me if you have any questions. tygerbug at yahoo.com.

   Paul has written in asking how you're supposed to burn this disc, since it's nearly 5GB big. Well, the disc is actually about 4.1 GB large and will easily fit on a standard DVD-R. The extra space is just taken up by a bunch of MP3s and other goodies - just don't burn those to DVD. Only burn the VIDEO_TS folder (and AUDIO_TS I suppose) and you'll be golden."
,Gloria,2007-07-24T21:12Z,"Your Disc 2 defenitely don't work.
There is fawlty files within the VIDEO_TS folder.
Roxio do nor recognize this folder.
I have to post this here since nobody is reacting on Disc 2 torrent."
,pelle1953,2007-08-16T06:11Z,"Why do you not fix disk 2,
so we can download it?"
,prawnshocker,2007-08-29T23:20Z,Absolutely the bee's knees! Truly superb compilation. Thanks so much.
,tygerbug,2007-09-11T19:43Z,"A lot of people have downloaded Disc 2 without trouble. Try it yourself.

The ONLY problematic file would be a text document that is not needed to play the DVD. You'll get to 99.99999% and the DVD will play fine."
,nancyrowina,2007-11-10T16:00Z,Any chance of some seeds for this? :)
,nancyrowina,2007-11-11T14:09Z,No seeds for this again :(
,qualman,2008-06-05T12:37Z,There appear to be a whole bunch of us at 99.9% - can anyone provide the missing 0.1% please?
,zibizebe,2008-08-11T00:16Z,"Hey Mr. Tygerbug
why won't you seed?
one day will do us fine
do it so then please.
Hey Mr. Tygerbug
do us favour please.
The time has come to
seed again I know you 
won't fail.
la la la laa la la
la la la la la.

There is a 0,1 % missing
in the video file whitch matters.
This is not a piece of cover.

You have the missing chunk, share
it with us - so it all makes sense."
