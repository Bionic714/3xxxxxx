linkin park in copenhagen (audio)

Ripped by Tripkore (another of his lies) and like all his other bootlegs, it is unfortunately rather lame quality....sorry... Like all the others he just extracted sounds from recordings other people made, and apparently that's what he calls "ripping" eventhough "rip-off" would be way more accurate...what an attention seeking lame ass!

Funny how he accuses ME of stealing credit (never did, simply uploaded a torrent here and GAVE him credit!) and then he releases THIS bootleg which I provided him with all the material for. Nice work, you double standard noob!

Well, anyway....
