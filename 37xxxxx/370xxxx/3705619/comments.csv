,agony1,2007-06-04T22:49Z,any one tested? thanks
,helmsman,2007-06-05T09:40Z,Trojan horse according to AVG
,Typooni,2007-06-05T18:54Z,"detected: Trojan program Backdoor.Win32.Rbot.cnp	File: H:\Vista.Activation.Crack.V2.By.Vistatalk.on.EFnet-ViSTATALK.rar/vistatalk.exe//data0000.cab/RxBot.exe//Armadillo

Yeah, this is Kaspersky Internet Security latest virus definitions and latest build.

So definitely trojan infected file."
,Typooni,2007-06-06T00:47Z,Dont download this shit
,XweAponX,2007-06-07T19:41Z,"Dear Assholes:

A) Open the ARCHIVE with WinRAR
A.1) Open the vistatalk.exe file with WINRAR
A.2) DELETE the fuckin file
B) The remaining file is what it is, that is to say, it is the latest Vistatalk ""Permanent-30-Day"" Vista activation.

It is an 8/10 Krak. meaning it is OK, but there is a 10/10 crack out there, the look for

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3678412/Vista_Activator_100__Working___(Safe_Download).rar

That one give you a permanent, VALID install of Vista.

That takes care of THAT.

NOW HEAR THIS!

1) AVG is the worst virus program ever- as in what does the word WORTHLESS mean to you?

2) KASPERSKY is the worst virus program ever- as in what does the word WORTHLESS mean to you?

3) MCAFEE is the worst virus program ever- as in what does the word WORTHLESS mean to you? (Also, what does the word BLOATWARE mean to you?)

4) NORTON is the worst virus program ever- as in what does the word WORTHLESS/BLOATWARE mean to you?

5) Spybot Search-And-Delete Important PROGRAM files and Spy-Delete-Non-Spyware Doctor are the worst programs ever. Might as well have ""Spyfalcon"" for all the good they do, they detect valid and important system files as spyware. They delete arbitrarily on strength of the name of the file extension and not by any scanning of the files themselves. WORSE then worthless, DANGEROUS.

NEVER ever ever fuckin depend ONLY on what some cocksucking lamer program like AVG says a file is: Always look at it by breaking it up.

Viruses are EASY to spot.

And, if they somehow managed to alter the Vista talk crack in here, well, sometimes it is worth infecting VISTA (Vista is an infection all of its own) just to see the nature of the virus.

DELETE the RXBOT.exe file out of the archive.

The actual Vista CRACK is the ""vistatalk.exe"" file which has a little red devil icon. If you right klik on it and get the file summaries, you can see it is the real thing."
,Typooni,2007-06-07T22:33Z,"Yeah yeah, dont be so agressive... :P

Also FortiClient found this:

action=quarantined file=""h:\vista.activation.crack.v2.by.vistatalk.on.efnet-vistatalk.rar"" virus=""W32/RBot.CNP!tr.bdr"" msg=""AntiVirus realtime protection found virus""

But hey, its like you said, every one can find, identify and delete that virus file if they want to support virus release and so on... Better get all clean release from some clean place..."
,XweAponX,2007-06-10T22:26Z,"Yah, sorry for being too aggressive ahaha. I aggressively hate Vista so it comes out in my posts.

The reason NOD32 does not find this as a virus and do anything with it, is because it is like a spore, in a dormant state. Won't so anything unless you run it, and then it is an arse pain to get rid of. Actually I'm gonna run the virus just so I can find out what it TRIES to do. I'll just shove it into Ollydebug and attach it, see what it calls up.

Just for safety I scan Everything I get from these sources. Most of the time, they are clean and just mis-reported, AVG and Spybot S&D do that alot. Norton, Norton is worthless, even if it does find a valid virus, it will not do anything about it unless you tell it to, and that's why I like NOD32, cos you can tell it what to do beforehand and then run the scan and not worry about it.

This type of KrAk is practically obsolete anyway. But I DID download this, and, after deeleeting the fyukkin virus, I used the Vistatalk crack to remove the timerstop device.

Then I re-installed this one:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3678412/Vista_Activator_100__Working___(Safe_Download).rar

And by golly and gosh, I now have to perfectly genuine, activated and update-downloading installations of Vista.

So, this vistatalk version is really good- And has several options one of which totally removes the timerstop.sys.

Now, I know that it is probably more reasonable to just download a non-infected torrent, but instead of searching through here, Demonoid, BTmon, and everywhere else, I just used this one seeing as it really was the actual crack when it came right down to it.
