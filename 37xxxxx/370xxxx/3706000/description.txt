Hoodwinked was a musical album released in December 2005, before the film of the same name was released. It features a score by John Mark Painter, and songs performed by various artists, including Todd Edwards, Cory Edwards, Anne Hathaway, Ben Folds, Pupil and more.

The soundtrack is no longer available in stores; the writer/director Corey Edwards cites disagreements between the record label, Ryko, and the executive producer (investor) as a reason.

I spent the afternoon tracking these files down today and all the existing torrents seem to be nuked.
