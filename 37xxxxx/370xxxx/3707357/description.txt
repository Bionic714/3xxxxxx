=====================

Complete rewrite of the AVI demuxer, for improvement such as:
* accurate determination of audio start time, working with CBR/VBR audio (fixes most audio out of sync issues)

* lightning fast preview scroller, will give 99% of the time a perfect image
* files with 'rec ' chunks are handled
* accurate duration determination (fixes bogus or truncated AVI that used to need a parsing to obtain their accurate duration)
