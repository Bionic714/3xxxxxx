My parents taped this back in 1988 roughly, and I've been watching it my entire life, its what made me hooked on Ghostbusters. So naturally when I got a standalone DVD recorder my first order of business was to preserve this on DVD. Naturally the video/audio is not great and if you just want to watch the movie, then download a DVD Rip. I just thought I'd offer it to anyone who wanted to jump back in time to see the movie as it was shown in 1988 complete with commercials and everything. If anyone knows of similar torrents available (Movies/shows with commercials) I'd love to download them. Enjoy!

P.S - Excuse the menus, they suck, they're just the ones that my DVD recorder automatically creates.
