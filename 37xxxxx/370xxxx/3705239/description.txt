In this compilation you have two RAR files each with their own set of savegames from every 10 years... NOTHING has been changed on any of the teams. I started a new game, created a manager (unemployed) and put him on holidays. Then I saved every 10 years... 


There are two (maximum compression) RAR files... use WinRAR (available at www.rarsoft.com) to decompress.

One has:

All england leagues
All french leagues
All italian leagues
All spain leagues
MLS

The other has:

All england leagues
All german leagues
All italian leagues
All spain leagues
MLS

Please enjoy! :D
