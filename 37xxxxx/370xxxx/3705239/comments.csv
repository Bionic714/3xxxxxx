,Haueri,2007-06-04T16:22Z,Why not just start a game with random players? :P
,TheCracka,2007-06-04T17:19Z,Because that's not the same thing at all and is just renamed players? :P

*sigh*

Think, Haweri, think. There'll be different teams at the top of each division. Different financial situations due to buyouts etc. Different expectations from the board because each team will be in different situations than in a brand new game, etc etc.

Get it now?"

For clarification when I say NOTHING has been changed on any of the teams I mean this:

I started a game choosing the leagues I wanted

I made an unemployed manager

I put him on holidays"
