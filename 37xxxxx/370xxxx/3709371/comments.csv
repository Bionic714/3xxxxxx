,GNRobiN,2007-06-11T14:37Z,How do I get the right names on the songs? What do I do with the songs.dtb file?
,IamLemmy,2007-06-11T18:42Z,"Forget tha songs.dtb. It is old and have a problem. 

To edit the musics and groups names, use the GH2DTBedit. Search it in the scorehero forum.

Good Luck!
"
,IamLemmy,2007-06-11T18:48Z,"You need just to burn de ISO and enjoy!

Forget that songs.dtb inside the rar file.

In this version, the songs and groups names are the same that GH2 original. Then, print this song list e follow it. If you want to change the songs and groups name, in scorehero forum you will find informations to make this.

Enjoy!"

,YellowVestedZmbe,2007-08-24T09:40Z,sum1 should just make 1 that is just gh2 for the 360. this is pretty cool though if it works.
