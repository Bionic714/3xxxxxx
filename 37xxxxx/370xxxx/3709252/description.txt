Quran Viewer - version 2.9 (Islam)

"Quran Viewer" is a nice-looking and stable windows freeware that offers its user access to *The Holy Quran* in 27 different languages (other than arabic).

It has been developed by *Jamal al-Nasir*.

The languages for which there are more than 1 translation are : English (9) , German (2) , Spanish (2) , Urdu (2).

The languages for which there is 1 translation are : 

Alabanian, Azerbaijani, Bosnian, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, Finnish, French, Hausa, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Malayalam, Maranao, Portuguese, Russian, Somali, Swahili, Tamil, Thai, Turkish.

As I understand, "Multilingual Quran Viewer" is no longer being supported or developed since *Jamal al-Nasir* had to step down for personal reasons....So, cyber-dwellers : get it while you can !.
