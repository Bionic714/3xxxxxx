Great game, enjoy it.

greeetz."
,Ace Busby,2007-06-05T04:24Z,Thanks Dope. Does the game work better than the demo did?
,420dopeman,2007-06-05T04:54Z,"Actually yes, It's quite immpressive in most areas. Read up on the user comments on gamespot for more detailed info. 
A definate winner here mate.
cheers ace."
,chris32,2007-06-05T06:05Z,"As always, thank you dopeman. :))"
,420dopeman,2007-06-05T13:25Z,"I'm sure this may work on p.o.s Vista, but just to save the questions from you Vista whores, the following is directly from the games readme file.

'Supported OS: Windows 2000/XP'

happy gaming XP goers."
,420dopeman,2007-06-05T14:13Z,"that's quite an excellent o/s compared to Vista. No matter what ya do, just dont buy in to microshafts prison of an o/s vista. XP will be supported for many, many, more years to come, just as you can stiil use 2000, 7 years later. The shaft is in beg of wanting users to swich to Vista, and this is due only to the fact that they have you by the balls when you do run that p.o.s. o/s.

Any 'Vista only' game produced will eventually be run on XP, and if you notice no major scene group is even attempting to touch these games. This is the sole fact that they to know, Vista blows, and they want nothing to do with it, quite wisely I must say.
greets."
,Churchills Dog,2007-06-05T15:12Z,"Thanks DM


BTW, anyone know if the new english version of Parkan II (not the english language mod) is getting ripped at any point?"
,420dopeman,2007-06-05T15:44Z,"yep ,yep, very true, I'm gonna wait until the good modded, ripped down, pirate versions come out myself, 
like you said though at least 3-4 years.

Here's words to live by on that o/s for now.

You DO NOT own Vista, Vista OWNS YOU-and your PC.

No pun towards its users of course, I'd imagine most purchased their PC that way. I hope..."
,Chiva$,2007-06-05T19:25Z,"Ok just a question that might sound stupid,it's just that i've never experienced any similar trouble up to now,that's why i wanted to ask.
When you say: ""**64 bit O/S users, pass, unless you are skilled to manually enter the 
registry settings which contain the almighty serial# needed for play.**"" you mean that i for example that have a AMD Athlon 64 procesor will have problems playing the game,and if yes,is there any guide wich shows you how to manually enter the registry settings you mention.
Thnx in advance,and dopeman you're doing a great job,keep it up;)"
,420dopeman,2007-06-05T19:36Z,"No no, you most certainly can play the game, I too have amd64, great choice btw, I simply meant the latter. Yes there is a guide, and most can perform the manual entry, I've just learned from past experience its easier for me to 'ward off' those using 64 or they simply blame their mishaps on I. 
So you can just open the setup.reg with notepad to view the entries which must be entered, and enjoy a fine game.
cheers mate."
,gtr2,2007-06-05T20:05Z,"Dont know how ya do it dope, but this shit is dope, great game, smooth running and superb graphics, story looks most interesting as well. Looking forward to gettin in to this one. Thanks again."
,Lostiniraq,2007-06-05T20:30Z,"Zomg, I liek h8 vista n shizzle. 

Wake up and smell the coffee, AMDboi; XP will be dead within two years tops
"
,Chiva$,2007-06-05T20:33Z,"Heh i understand,i saw some of the ""strange"" comments on some other torrents...There will always be people that strangely can't run a game although much others strangely again can!
Well maybe some more attention to the note files coming with the torrent would be suggested,anyway thnx again for clearing 64 bit question.

good gaming;)"
,420dopeman,2007-06-05T20:45Z,"lol, Lostiniraq, so you one of the vista whores. And xp will be dead just as win98 is, NOT.

Get a clue dude."
,420dopeman,2007-06-05T20:56Z,"BTW, some statistical facts. Not sure where you're from, but where I'm from there's still thousands upon thousands of corporations still running win2000 and winME on their multi-network setups, i.e. millions of PC's , do you think mr. gates is gonna foot the bill to upgrade these millions of PC's . I dont think so, and where I'm from, these corporations set the standard with there lobbyist dinero, not individuals.
XP will never go away."
,Chiva$,2007-06-05T23:16Z,"hm....vista,vista maybe after the second or third service pack,just like XP a long time ago..."

The guys never gonna fix the damn cable and we all know it.

right click the CoJ.exe and select properties
go to the compatibility tab
check the combatibility mode - 'run this program in compatibility mode for: ' and select windows 95

After that, you'll be confronted with the missing d3dx9_29.dll message. google it and download it, then put it in your windows/system folder.

The first time i started the game after that, I got a black screen, but at the second try it worked perfectly.

Good Luck!

,deivido2,2009-12-23T10:38Z,"This is no Garbage Givijoarna.
when running trough Reg/Data Decompressing, makes the game faster because of the huge data file ammount lowering.
All who have Problems with the CD-Key change the line in the reg file.

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Techland\CallOfJuarez]
""SerialNumber""=""RKYRT-9FACF-YE9AA-E9XCF-ECF9Y""
This is the Cd key Change it to What you like but it must be correct to the game.

,EljefeS,2010-07-23T12:20Z,How i edit the registry?
,ThePhuckwit,2010-09-06T16:50Z,"This torrent sucks ass. Why? No install so you need a supercomputer to run it seamlessly. The intro to the game would show a new frame every 2 seconds or so and I couldn't even click on play once the laggy ass intro was finally over.

 I'm staying the hell away from ""no install"" torrents from now on, every single one I've tried lags like crazy or doesn't work.

My computer exceeds min requirements and COJ2 doesn't lag anywhere near this bad so this is a phucked torrent. GL to those with 4GHz you might actually be able to run it properly."

FOUND THE PROBLEM FOR ALL 64 BIT OS USERS!!!! this version is for 32 bit SO you need to edit the setup.reg file (rightclick - edit) and change the line:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Techland\CallOfJuarez]

to

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Techland\CallOfJuarez]

aas the registries for this game need to be within the wow6432 node. :D""

yup it worked just change the line, save and open again with regedit and play!"
