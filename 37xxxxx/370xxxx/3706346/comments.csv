,user1238,2010-02-14T23:43Z,"For those who played Hitman 2 Silent assasin i strongly don't recommend this game. I've played the full retail version and there is no new entertainment to be had. part 2 was pretty much the tops of the series. hitman 3 was developed for monkeyboxes and as such has simplistic controls, a lot of automation, and is very dumbed-down. the last level is not even passable unless u can find v.1.0 and use the cheat codes. boycott IO Interactive for releasing this sh!t. I've wasted 6$ on it but a 5$ pizza pie would have been more enjoyable. "
,....StEO....,2010-02-24T16:28Z,DONT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT its to slow to be truth
