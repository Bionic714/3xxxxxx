,420dopeman,2007-06-06T04:49Z,"btw, apprecite a little feedback on gameplay for this one, I have not had the chance to play, only test, you need about 1.3 gigs free HD space, and game is not loaded with pointless vids/credits/etc...

May just be one fine game here. I'll let you all decide.
cheers. "
,420dopeman,2007-06-06T05:01Z,"ahh, yes indeed. I noticed its been scored a 7.8 so far also, not to shabby. Fuck it, I'm off to play this bitch now. Cheers guys. 

happy gaming."
,Zachriel,2007-06-06T10:23Z,"Death to the vista fuckin clan members (Hi mom)

But guess what.. -.-
Those Vista whores stole it from me..

,Zachriel,2007-06-06T10:32Z,"And if anybody know a good ""forensic evidense"" game please tell me..
My favorit part of condemned was always the begining when you had to collect evidense..
Thanks.."
,taffyjac,2007-06-06T11:41Z,"The obvious one's would be CSI i think theres about 4 of em, other than that there's Still Life also, hope thats a few good evidence collecting idea's. "
,forgetit,2007-06-06T12:08Z,"Sorry to disappoint you guys, but this is one seriously shitty game. Screens look nice enough. But the gameplay is very simple and repetitive, and enemy ai non-existant."
,420dopeman,2007-06-06T12:39Z,"hey zachriel, there's a game similair to what you look for, it's called 'missing' ...released back in 05 I believe. It's on my list of games to be upped, so you'll prolly see it soon.

cheers."
,Riril,2007-06-06T12:54Z,"I have this one, I'll help with the seeding. Maximum up speed for me is aroun 140kb/s, not that good, but.. You know...

I really recommend this game, good fun!
Have a nice day!"
,Zachriel,2007-06-06T13:19Z,"Thanks for the tips guys..
This is one great community :) 
(exept for some people -.-)
And special thanks to you Dopeman , for all your hard work to bring us great games and making this site better and better everyday 
Cheers mate."
,blue32,2007-06-07T22:54Z,"""SCRATCHES"" Is another good ""mystery/evidence"" type game.(tough to finish)"
,420dopeman,2007-06-08T04:23Z,"lol, surely didnt think anyone would catch that..

your good dude, very nice, and an excellent statement at that."
[V],Subzero!,2007-06-08T13:18Z,"Seeders:
    156
Leechers:
    242

iam still dreaming of... gotta go stop releasing ,since not many ppl care about seeding...pah!"
,espen1812,2007-06-08T14:57Z,I liked the game very much! i won't download this version because i have downloaded the demo and that was enough for me;)
,Dupont60,2007-06-08T17:27Z,"Hey, dopeman!
You are the best.
Just curious; since you have so many games, do ave any games with a more ""adult"" touch to it?"
,Jovog,2007-06-08T23:51Z,the game crashes just when i am finished with the 2:nd mission anyone with the same problem?! :s
,xpcrkr,2007-06-09T01:43Z,"http://www.city-interactive.com/files/thiv/en_patch_1.1.exe

may help with crash and missing textures but i would check with dopeman if it would be cool to patch or not"
,420dopeman,2007-06-09T20:28Z,"sorry guys, it actually already contains that 1.1 patch, pre-applied of course, I know it crashes in Vista, that has been confirmed, can anyone confirm a crash in XP."
,420dopeman,2007-06-09T20:34Z,"I really cant say this enough, If you guys are serious about gaming, you REALLY NEED TO LOSE VISTA. I know its pretty and stuff, but that o/s is simply not ready for gamers, also that o/s is already being called the new WINME 2. The biggest flop of an o/s ever made. The rumors are that vista may now do the same, and not even be around for too much longer, I spend tons of time following these issues,  Its real easy to format your harddrives and install a fresh pirate copy of XP. TRUST ME, ITS WORTH IT>
I just don't get anyone using Vista, not yet anyway."
,thedirtyplant,2007-06-09T21:42Z,"THIS GAME IS GREAT. RUNS PERFECT, DOPEMAN OWNS."
,Metacom,2007-06-09T21:48Z,"THIV.exe isnt working for me, report keeps saying something about chromengine2.dll.

I tired the other 1.1 .dlls from gamecopyworld but still same error, damn thing wont even launch!

Love how I always have problems with these""rips"" when standard installations never give me problems.

And apperantly this game is also known as ""terrorist take down in colombia"" ugh..."
,420dopeman,2007-06-09T21:55Z,"dude , why not do yourself a favor and stay away form n00b proof rips.

Then you have nothing to whine about,

cheers."
,420dopeman,2007-06-09T22:01Z,"read the comments on mininova, another noob had the same problem as you. And he was even able to solve the problem, which he created himself, by himself. Some of you are really something speciaL.

There should be a handicapped section of downloads for people just like you. Have you noticed your the only one to report such a problem? I would feel like and IDIOT if I was you."
,katziewolf41,2007-06-10T05:35Z,lol
,DoaKao,2007-06-10T19:52Z,"dopeman, you really have to be nicer to newbies..."
,lukinba,2007-06-11T20:09Z,After the first mission the game freezes....anyone had the same problem?
,griseknoen,2007-06-12T00:48Z,"yes,you can use a screwdriver and a hammer to pick the ice away,or ( works for me ) put the computer close to the fireplace or owen,if you use the owen be sure never to go over 200 degrees/10 minutes.. do this and everything gonna be fine.."
,griseknoen,2007-06-12T00:49Z,"sorry, everythingÂ´s."
,killa4eva,2007-06-12T06:18Z,i say leave the nubbies alone they gotta learn sooner or later...that said...game blows......=)
,NukeBrother,2007-06-12T19:11Z,"Vista aint pretty! -.-
Vista is a Mac Wannabe!!"
,ford360,2007-06-12T21:57Z,"And mac is a windows wanna be as well since there switch to intel & Amd chips.Macs OS X is nice but its picky as hell during setup it recognized my G5 mouse but not after loading to desktop.

Mac OS X: To Picky.
Vista: Not enough Driver or game support.
XP:Works why mess with it."
,Bardal,2007-06-17T01:17Z,"I got Windows Vista Home Premium.
I dont got a single game that doesnt work on Vista that works on XP.
(This one worked as well).
With better performance than on XP :)
thanks for the game!
and btw.
if you got hardware that isnt ooold, Vista is the way to go! :)"
,Born Again,2007-06-19T22:37Z,can someone pls tell me why when playing the game the ground is yellow?
,Bardal,2007-06-20T16:48Z,"and by the way.
Ofcourse XP works NOW.
After how many years? 3-4?
I still remember how messy XP was when it was released.
It is exactly the same as with Vista.
It was a bit messy at the beginning due to drivers and game support.
but now (20\06\2007)
I cant find a single thing that doesnt work on Vista.
(Programs that doesnt work on Vista got an Vista version as well)
And it got driver support.
Just not if you have a crappy computer.
Then it will be best to stick with XP.
I dont use Vista for the visuals, but for the performance (and the Vista only games)

Shadowrun "
,ford360,2007-06-26T16:23Z,"supreme commander on Vista the game has serious frame rate issues, I have a good computer unless a vista rating of 4.3 is bad anyway on LOWEST!! settings the framerate is 10 and drops to 3 most of the time 

 I ran it on xp with a e6400,nvidia geforce 8500 GT 256MB DDR2 and 2gigs of ddr2 800, at almost maximun setting without frame rate issues."
,ford360,2007-06-26T16:52Z,"I almost forgot the biggest problems were on 
my brothers computer,Ati Catalyst control center
wouldn't work for shit on vista And major video problems with a HIS Radeon X1950XT ICEQ 3
couldn't overclock it fluctuating colors random 
black outs.

But the biggest suprise came when i put vista
on a Dell Dimension 4550
2Ghz Pentium 4 Northwood Socket 478
865pe chipset
1 gig of ddr333
sound Blaster Audigy card
the only upgrade is this EVGA GeForce 7800 GS 256MB GDDR3 Agp 8X limited to 4X, the rest is from dell
And it runs better under vista than xp
vista rating of 3.0
And takes every thing i throw at it thats supposed
to work with the processor anyway.
it works better on a pc thats always been a piece of crap,than one i just built specified in the last comment."
,juzzi90,2007-07-08T00:30Z,"yeah, this game really freezes after first mission (some error), but just close the game and run it again and its working. but nice release, i like your game rips dopeman :)"
,rc71,2007-07-19T17:55Z,I know there are a lot of complainers out there so thanks for your work.  I know it takes time to do these and to answer the same lame questions.  Thanks!
,noorizer,2007-07-23T18:31Z,"Thanks 420Dopeman.. This game works perfectly!.

,ErlandioZ,2007-08-15T21:17Z,"Workt perfectly! Never had any problems with your games. Keep it up, Dopeman"
,FRaGGLE-13,2007-09-08T03:48Z,Actually windows stole from apple i am a microsoft fanboi yes but microsoft did steal from apple
,Accuum,2007-10-13T10:58Z,"Dopeman, I agree totaly on the Vista thing, been working as a computer Tech (hardware not software) for 20 years, I'm now 60 and I can say that VISTA sucks big time. It's all the DRM and Slug-ware they put in it. Thanks a ton Dopeman, your releases are always good...."
,Accuum,2007-10-13T11:01Z,"Fraggie-13, 
did you also know that Microsoft owns a part of Apple, so I dont think they stole from them, if Microsoft hadn't of bailed them out when they did with a ton of cash, they would have went under, check it out....."
,hamis2,2007-10-26T19:45Z,"""the game crashes just when i am finished with the 2:nd mission anyone with the same problem?! ""

Yes,exactly same,i have Win 2000 pro."
,kusipuikko,2008-10-20T00:26Z,"nice rip, works fine (as always) but the game sucks ass. Don't waste your time on this game. Go out and get laid instead of playing this crap."
,Rommel5055,2008-11-05T02:30Z,how do i install it?? [im almost new on this ok??] there are 30 parts here
,Rommel5055,2008-12-09T22:52Z,"I have a problem... when I try to play it, only the sound works... my screen is black...What do I have to do?????????????? CAN ANYONE HELP????"
