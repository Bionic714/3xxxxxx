,chungwa,2010-05-04T08:23Z,"Looks like a nice app. Sadly I don't know how to 'associate files' with the cracked app. Also, the help files don't work in Win7 32 because of differences in directory structure. Any workarounds for this?"
,peter1279,2010-05-21T00:28Z,"1st)copy the crack file to  :C:\Program Files\SnowieGroup\Snowie4  (and  then ,make  a shortcut to desktop), i have windows 7 ,it runs ok,2nd)  for the help file ,just make the updates.  help-- >  update snowie online"
