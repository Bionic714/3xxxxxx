,toofan,2007-05-29T13:31Z,Thanks for this man.
,dimsan,2007-05-29T13:40Z,"Propaganda...please man...read a book...it was maybe a little ""overdone"" in the movie but the battle took place wether you like it or not...otherwise most of the world would today be persians...peace"
,toofan,2007-05-29T15:16Z,"dimsan. what the fuck are you talking about? 300 was in no way realistic or had any sense of historic content!

like you said yourself, read a god damn book!"
,werminard999,2007-05-29T20:54Z,"Dimsan, actually the Greeks panicked because Thermopylae fell much quicker than they thought it would... It was the Athenian navy that won the war in the end. Still, the Greeks themselves made this battle a legend. It's true that the Spartans did have balls, though."

And in this case,Hollywood should be spelled with a capital,not propaganda.
Back to school,first English,then gramma and finally history.

,dimsan,2007-05-31T20:10Z,"Let me guess toofan...Persian? You really should read...all I know are that Persians were faggots then...and are still faggots today...And werminard, I know that the Athenian navy stopped them and only stopped the Persian empire but with the resourses they had the world must see the Greek fight as a victory:)"
