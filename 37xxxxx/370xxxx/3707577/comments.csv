,xianr,2007-08-04T14:12Z,VTS02_ OVOB doesnÂ´t exist !!
,LbL,2008-04-04T10:54Z,"xianr:

If VTS_02_0.VOB doesn't exist, then just copy VTS_02_0.BUP and rename it VTS_02_0.VOB, since BUP files are BackUps for VOB files!

,Haldor_D,2008-06-19T14:21Z,"Well, looking at the files present in this torrent and the sizes of them, i'd say they're possibly backup files of the IFO-files"
,Haldor_D,2008-06-19T14:23Z,"Yes, as they say at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BUP

""The BUP file is a backup of the IFO file on a DVD, which contains the information about the organization of tracks, menus, chapters, subtitles on the disc. The BUP files are used in the event that the corresponding IFO file is unreadable, perhaps due to a scratch on the surface of the disc."""
