  Eye Candy┬« 5: Textures is a collection of ten seamless texture generators.
  The first of three upgrades to Eye Candy 4000, Textures produces a wide
  variety of texture effects, including snake and lizard skin, fur, brick,
  stone and wood. Graphic designers, Web developers and 3D artists can quickly
  create backgrounds, skins, seamless tiles and more.

  Relying on the contents of a stock texture library limits creativity.
  Textures creates a limitless variety of photo-realistic surfaces for $99,
  the cost of a stock CD. And, because every filter has a seamless tile
  option, tiling is quick and easy.

  Textures includes settings for over 200 frequently used effects. A new
  settings system makes it easy to explore these effects. The ability to save
  and export makes sharing settings a snap.

  Textures works with 16-bit images and does not compromise expanded color
  depth. Color transitions are smoother and print documents reproduce colors
  more accurately.
