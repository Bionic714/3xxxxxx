He wasn't the most accomplished member of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young--or even of Crosby, Stills &Nash, for that matter. But his songs are certainly in a league with those of the other members, and it's chiefly on his solo albums that Stills's own personality comes through. Buffalo Springfield's "For What It's Worth" belongs to Stills, which shows where his influences lie. The hits "Love the One You're With" and "Sit Yourself Down," both of which live here, show how they developed. Sensitive? Lyrical? Not exactly.
