,bellis,2007-06-09T16:50Z,from what I can see there is no keygenerator in this pack .
,von-acid,2007-06-09T17:22Z,Är kanske en självuppackaden exe-fil.. döp om till typ .rar eller nått och öppna med winrar.. så kanske ni hittar nått
,Pictureman2,2007-06-09T19:29Z,"to Yrrgh and bellis:
In fact there is a keygenerator..as von-acid says, you can rename the .exe file to for example .zip and you will find a working keygenerator. Just put your name in it and a key is generated as wincmd.key. Put it in the installed directory of total commander and all is working. If you don´t want to do this there is a working TC from Nowarez here:

No keygen, just the ordinary installation files .. "
,bellis,2007-06-09T19:39Z,Just to add to the confusion .. Inside the .cab file there si a keygen .. Thats odd you should never change in a .cab file .. well well you always seeing something new every day ..  hehe 
,RSiP,2007-06-11T09:26Z,"For all my releases of total Commander:
The keygen is in the install.exe (install.cab)
After installation the keygen is in the TC folder.
Run keygen to create a keyfile... enjoy"
