,dead_valentine,2012-03-21T09:30Z,"if you go into the program install directory and look for the folder called ""Drivers Win98-ME-2K-XP"" copy the ""dpu2k.dll"" file into the folder with the programs EXE file in and it works fine.. 

Did any of you actually bother to search your system for a file called ""dpu2k.dll"" ?

If brains were gunpowder, you wouldn't have enough to blow your nose! lol"
