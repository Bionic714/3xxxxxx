,shade42,2007-08-09T04:23Z,"I needed an XP Pro disc to reinstall Windows on a broken PC which didn't come with a CD. This would have been just the thing. Unfortunately it's not downloading. I started it 2 weeks ago. It must have been stuck on around 75% for about a week. Time to bail out.

The user has uploaded 2 torrents of this (why?!). As far as I can see from the stats neither is working."
