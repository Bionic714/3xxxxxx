You'll notice I also shot the Beastie Boys at Sasquatch too."
,pmsbull,2007-06-15T10:56Z,"Nice job MAGMAZING. The video could have been better, but you really get a feal for what it was like to actuelly be there, and the sound is great. Well done mate, got any more? PM me and let me know what you've posted. Cheers."
,xjb119,2007-06-17T18:25Z,Needing one more to seed. I'm stuck at 97.1% right now.
,rod3nt,2007-06-18T17:46Z,seed ffs!
,Sigurdurg,2007-06-26T10:29Z,"I can´t get this thing to work, corrupt files?"
,magmazing,2007-06-27T10:59Z,"There is nothing wrong the files. The DVD was put together in Adobe Encore, I burned a test copy in Nero and everything's fine. 

If you're burning the files as just a data dvd, it obviously won't play in a video dvd player"
,Sigurdurg,2007-06-27T21:42Z,I´m opening the files directly from the hard drive with PowerDVD like I always do and it doesn´t work. VLC doesn´t play the files either.
,pmsbull,2007-06-30T23:34Z,"@SIGURDURG
Hello mate, I got this working no prob, just convert via win avi to dvd.
Check out the Battle of Mexice City and Live Grand Olympic Auditorium...AWESOME !"
,SalvaVeritate,2007-08-19T17:58Z,"There's one damn seeder right now. This is bullshit, why doesn't anybody seed? At this rate it's gonna take 4 more days and I've already been downloading for 24 hours+ while a 4.3 GB torrent at dimeadozen finished in about 15 hours, because people there actually seed when they finish downloading a torrent. Someone upload it there instead, this is ridiculous."
,saisumimen,2007-08-23T01:42Z,"To all the people talking about having their files corrupted: Listen up.

This torrent looks like it's being poisoned. The offending hosts come up as:

so block them if your torrent client supports IP blocking."
,SalvaVeritate,2007-08-29T04:52Z,I've been at 99.9% for 2 days....I've blocked the IPs and everything. Seed damn it!

If you're a member at that site, the download will be much faster and you won't find the same problems that I did (6 GB ""thrown away"")"
