DVD of Rage Against the Machine\\\'s performance at the Coachella Music Festival, April 29, 2007.

The video was shot by me with a canon camcorder and a mini monopod I snuck into the concert venue and I created a dvd of the footage with Adobe Encore. So burn the Video_TS folder in Nero or whatever DVD burning software you use and enjoy.

Hopefully this torrent actually works, if it doesn\\\'t I apologize. This is my first torrent at the Pirate Bay. Trying to figure things out.
