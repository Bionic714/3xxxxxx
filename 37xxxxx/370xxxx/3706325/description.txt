For all those new to the Pirate Bay, WELCOME!!!

For all those who hate the extracting, unzipping, unraring, etc, you're WELCOME!!!

Here is the movie you all have been eagerly anticipating, "Mr. Bean's Holiday".

No, this is not my work; I downloaded the movie from another website, the difference is that I've done all the work for you. All you need to do is just DOWNLOAD, WATCH, and ENJOY. There are only two files you have to deal with, the sample clip. and the movie itself which is in widescreen at an aspect ratio of 16:9 with domiensions of 672x352.

The video itself is DVD-Rip quality if not better. The sound is rather hollow at 129 kbps, but the quality of the picture more than makes up for the shallow sound.

Nevertheless, you WILL laugh your head off watching this; just please seed after you finish the download. Thank you.
