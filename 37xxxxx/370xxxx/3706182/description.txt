Wassup everybody... Was browsing the usual music blogs yesterday, and some of them posted a link to a YouTube-video featuring images from the Daft Punk office. It was quickly removed from the blogs as well as YouTube. Don't know why, probably because Daft Punk found it. But yeah I got pretty lucky cause (I'm a big fan!) the first thing I did was save it off YouTube using keepvid.com. And since I think it's a pretty interesting thing that should be released to the public no matter what Daft says, here it is.
