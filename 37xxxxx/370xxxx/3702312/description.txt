Oprah and David Hawkins talk in this beautiful interview. As Oprah has read Power vs. Force by David Hawkins they go much more into depth and communicate on a personal basis that can bring tears to your eyes.

David Hawkins has been one of my personal teachers and I can say all that what he stands for has been subjectively verified through me and has worked wonders in my life. May I share this blessing with you.
