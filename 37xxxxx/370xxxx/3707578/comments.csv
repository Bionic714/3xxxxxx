,vadaerdethaer,2008-02-21T08:43Z,please seed. Tried to get a hold of this for months.
,GKraften,2008-03-04T02:30Z,"First of all, thanks for the upload, I've been looking for this ever since I saw it on TV.

Second, how the hell do you get it to play? I can't seem to mount or play anything in the DL... Do you absolutely, positively have to burn it on a DVD for it to work properly?"
,GKraften,2008-03-04T03:27Z,"Ahh... Finally got it... Sorry for being a n00b.

For anyone else with a similar problem, you can use a program like AVS Video Converter to make it onto a format usable straight off your comp. A (presently) good torrent is http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4049138/AVS_Video_Tools_v5.1.1.20_FULL"
,GKraften,2008-03-04T03:45Z,"(Sorry for the incessant posting)

...and if you follow those steps, you will probably discover (much as I did) that, apparently, the ONLY spoken language is Spanish.

So unless you happen to be from Spain/Mexico/etc., have a babel fish stuck in your ear, or somehow have some strange and unspeakable fetish for Spanish audio tracks, I don't recommend downloading this.

Or, possibly, I recommend being smarter than me instead. That might also work."
,sildurin,2008-08-27T07:01Z,"Sorry, GKraften, but you are wrong. This DVD contains english and spanish audio tracks. I verified that."
,GKraften,2008-10-04T22:14Z,"Thanks for the correction. I still can't get it to play in english, though... But I guess that it's probably just me having a blond moment then :3"
,ezboard,2008-11-15T11:31Z,"of course you can't, duh, you have to look for language selection screen "
,ezboard,2008-12-04T20:52Z,"does anybody have an ENGLISH dvrip of this with NO subtitles? or know where I can find it?

nobody fucking likes DVDs "
[V],maestral,2008-12-11T15:31Z,"I have problem with this DVD to play. I burned is the same as other 2 parts, and they work fine, except this one. all i can get is to replay that sequence before main menu all over again. Cant get it to start or get to manu at all.

Any sugestions?"
[V],maestral,2008-12-12T23:30Z,This download is full of errors. Can't get it to play. I even try to extract only the movie with DVD shrink and still I get some retarded movie with mixed timestamps and cant get it to play from the beggining to the end. it starts at 8-10 min and ends before normal time and stuff like that. Somebody screwed something with this video totaly
[V],maestral,2008-12-13T13:49Z,"If anyone have these problems with this DVD I manage to make it work. First of all i downloaded it through only demonoid servers, as it was originated from there, so I deleted all other servers when i opened this torrent in utorrent. After that I burned it normaly with nero and it works perfectly. I assumed that someone from some other server had bad sector or something and its uploaded damaged so its healthy through demonoid."
,12chamberedheart,2009-06-17T05:14Z,"is this all three discs?
its fucking massive.

seed please :D"
,qcx,2010-01-07T22:09Z,"Here's a hint that worked for me for all of you who don't want that f***ing language in audio or subtitles screwing on your screen:

Get ""The KMPlayer"" (it's freeware).
Drag the folder from explorer into KMP.
Click the right button on the circle menu in the right bottom corner.
Chose ""Audio Castanella"" and ""Sin Subtitulos"".
When the intro plays, click right -> DVD Controls -> Audio -> English.
You're done. Have fun.

The data in my torrent is absolutely correct and contains the first DVD."
,GKraften,2010-04-23T03:30Z,"Just thought I'd mention it - I finally got it to play in English. Don't remember what I really did, though (just had to do a reinstall), but I know this works.

So you can DL this even if you don't have a fetish for Spanish audio :P"
