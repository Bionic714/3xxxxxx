This amazing UFO documentary film was produced in 1977.  It was way ahead of its time.  Sadly, the master copies of this film and the two which followed it have been lost to the ravages of time.  Only one VHS copy of it survived; so Channel 9 gave us permission to convert it to digital video in an effort to preserve it as an archive for the use of posterity.

This film inspired Stan Deyo to write \"The Cosmic Conspiracy\" book which is the sequel to the shows.  The man-made, flying saucer programs are exposed in the book and the film.

The Cosmic Conspiracy - Millenium Edition

Recruited by the Illuminati, Stan Deyo was taken secretly to Australia in 1971 to design \"flying saucer\" propulsion systems with them. Deyo reveals years later why \"they\" keep the alien/UFO agenda from the public. Many have investigated this huge conspiracy from the outside looking in - BUT, only one has come forward from an insider\'s perspective. Stan Deyo\'s The Cosmic Conspiracy is his testimony to you who would know the truth....
