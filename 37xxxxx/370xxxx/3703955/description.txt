Another release in the Black metal classic series:

Here by i present to you: Enslaved

Enslaved was along with bands like darkthrone, mayhem, emperor & burzum one of the first pioneers in the Norwegian Black metal scene.

However...

Where most bands took satanism and occultism as their trademarks in their lyrics, Enslaved found it's lyrical inspiration in the Viking heritage.
This album is their first album and it has a very unique cold atmosphere, a classic must-have for anyone who calls himself a fan of the genre!

File is packed as a .Rar file, enjoy!

Horns up!
