In the beginning of 2000, Victor Smolski composed and produced his first solo CD, which was recorded in co-operation with the Belarusian Orchestra and his colleagues from Rage. This Symphony, entitled The Heretic deals with the time of burning witches. The Heretic was released on the 19th of June 2000. Noticed by the international press, parts of this exceptional "Metal meets Classic" album The Heretic were presented live during a few concerts together with the Belarusian Orchestra in the same year.
