,CyborgSuperman,2008-05-09T03:29Z,"The first title is wrong but it's cool. The title of the first album is 'House of Pain'. It 'IS' the first release. I own ALL their music, the albums and the remixes too. The logo on the cover, which reads ""Fine Malt Lyrics"", is often referred to as the name of the album but is IS NOT. The 'Fine Malt Lyrics' is part of the House of Pain logo. It's on ALL their gear from back in the day. 'House of Pain' is the debut album from House of Pain, released: July 21, 1992. 'Same as It Ever Was' is the second album from House of Pain, released June 28, 1994. Truth Crushed to Earth Shall Rise Again is the third (and last) album, released October 10, 1996. The album was called 'Truth Crushed To Earth Shall Rise Again', but the cover of the CD says 'Truth Crushed To Earth Will Rise Again'."
