Joe Jackson (born August 11, 1954 in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, as David Ian Jackson) is an English musician and singer/songwriter probably best-known for the 1979 hit song "Is She Really Going Out With Him?", which still gets extensive FM radio airplay, and for his 1982 hit, "Steppin' Out".

He was a part of the trio of British-based artists that challenged the punk scene and brought a New Wave sound to the United States in the late 1970s, along with Elvis Costello and Graham Parker. He was popular for his power-pop and New Wave sound early on before moving to more eclectic, though less commercially successful, pop/jazz/classical musical pieces.
