Plot:	It?s Meng Yuan-Wen vs. Kuan Feng in this wild and wacky wushu saga of a priceless pole with a spectacular secret.

Overview:	It?s Meng Yuan-wen (star of The Master Strikes) versus Kuan Feng in this wild and wacky wushu saga of a priceless pole with a spectacular secret. A master martial artist?s silly disciple struggles to save it from an evil white slaver, the slaver?s duplicitous wife, and even his own bone-headed, but greedy, companion. Hsu Hsia choreographs the abundant action, as he had for both Five Superfighters and Drunken Master. The result is both sublime (for its kung-fu) and engagingly ridiculous.
