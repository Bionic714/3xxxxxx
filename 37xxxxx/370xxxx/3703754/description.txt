I decided to upload a series of classic BM genre releases.
This because most of these releases are not to be found on TPB.
Foremost these bands could be considered very original for their time being, in fact they set the sound for what is considered normal in BM these days.

so....
This is the first 1994 release by Gorgoroth, one of the early pioneers in black metal  and this album is a classic must-have. It's sound is harsh, grim and the atmosphere is cold and hatefull.

Packed as a .Rar enjoy!

Horns up!
