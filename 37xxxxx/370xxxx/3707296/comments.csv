Great!!! Thanks again!
And do not forget to seed. No seeders for some time now.

All the best  "
,tygerbug,2007-06-08T23:36Z,"I am seeding all the time, except when I'm sleeping (US Pacific time, about 3AM to noon last night).

This one seems to be uploading much slower than the first disc, but it'll get there.

I have also created two PAL discs which I won't post here - they contain some (not nearly all) of the same material in its original PAL format. I've filled up the second disc with some additional surprises.

Won't post that here, as it's just duplicating material, but email me at tygerbug at yahoo.com anyone who's interested in further Bonzoness."
,poopiehead,2007-06-12T12:25Z,"For people downloadin this torrent, if you do not complete it 100%, it's because the uploader accidentally changed the tiny text file.

He is seeding it so you should probably be able to finish the whole thing except for that one text file, which is probably just the same as the description."
,tygerbug,2007-07-16T23:35Z,"If you're stuck at 99%, and have been for some time, you have the entire disc, really. Burn it and be happy."
,Gloria,2007-07-24T21:14Z,"Why has this torent never been downloaded?
It's not complete and it is not recognized as a VIDEO_TS file!
Or am I totally wrong?
How do I burn it.
I can see that it has never been snatched..."
,stanbrook,2007-09-06T08:47Z,"TYGERBUG PLEASE HELP US!

I'm stuck at 99.9%. I don't mind losing a text file but VTS_09_1.VOB is only 99.7% which means the DVD is incomplete."
,tygerbug,2007-09-11T19:46Z,"Seriously, you should be fine. A tiny amount of data missing at the end of the disc isn't going to kill the disc."
,stanbrook,2007-09-20T08:48Z,Yeah! I still can still watch MOST of it.
,baragon63,2007-10-13T07:41Z,"Simply amazing stuff here, I've been a Bonzos fan since the early 70s and had never seen any of this material before. Really nice work mastering the disc as well, good menus and transitions between scenes.

Regardless of the VTS_09_1.VOB file showing only 99.7%, the disc burns flawlessly with Roxio Toast, and plays fine as well. The BONZOS2VIV.layout file does not appear to be necessary when burning the disc, as both copies I've burned do fine without it, but perhaps tygerbug had a reason for including it.

As the only file missing is the .txt file, you should have no trouble downloading, burning and enjoying this treasure. Also, despite TPB showing 0 Seeders or Leechers, there are plenty of people sharing this.

Nice one! ;-)"
,nancyrowina,2007-11-10T16:00Z,Any chance of some seeders for this? :)
,LbL,2008-03-28T18:39Z,"

Those 8 people standing at 99.9% must have been there for 9 months now, and they'll never ever gonna get the missing 0.01% ...

And they don't need it, it's only the TEXTfile that is missing, EVEN though the VTS_09_1.VOB shows is only at 99.7%, but it really isn't (an dyou can alsways use FIXVTS to correct it), so burn on, and enjoy instead of wasting your expensive bandwidth waiting for something that is never gonna come to you ... !

,unholm,2008-04-10T05:22Z,"I know & love the Bonzo's plus all their Solo-Stuff for almost 40 years now. 
Though I collect their material for a long time, I still found lots of sequences on this 2 DVD's i havn't seen before.
A SPECIAL SURPRISE were the 8 CD's attached to the first DVD !! The VIVIAN STANSHALL Radio Shows are ...UNBELIVABLE !! I find no words for it, maybe just, that my belly & face muscles were hurting from laughing ...
THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH!!!
And again, the 99,9% of DVD 2 are ABSOLUTLY NO PROBLEM!!
NOTHING is missing whatsoever.
Best wishes to you,
So long,
Hans-Helmut (unholm)
I'll keep on seeding on, as long as there is need for it. So, don't worry friends!!
