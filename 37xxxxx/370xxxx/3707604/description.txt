Synopsis: Survivors of a sea battle, an American Navy pilot (Lee Marvin) and a Japanese Navy Captain Kuroda (Toshiro Mifune) find themselves alone and almost weaponless, facing each other on a pretty but harsh Pacific isle with no fresh water. Their duel to the death fades as neither has the desire to kill the other, and after a period of hostility they begin to work as a survival team. The language barrier leads to a lot of shouting and crossed signals, but eventually they start construction of a seaworthy bamboo raft.
