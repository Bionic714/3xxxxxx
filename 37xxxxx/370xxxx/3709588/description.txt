An Interview with Alexander Sokurov (49 min)

Moloch - "Working on the Film"

Official Selection Cannes 1999

Russian filmmaker Alexander Sokurov lives in a world as far removed 
from commercial cinema as it is possible to get.
Using modest means, he produces uncompromising works that address the 
most profound quandaries of human existence, giving form to spiritual 
concerns.
His works are deeply serious, and challenge his viewers to approach 
them with utter seriousness.
