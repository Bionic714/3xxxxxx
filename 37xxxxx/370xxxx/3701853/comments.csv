Thus, 3 stars."

,PTSpawn,2009-06-06T19:08Z,"I didn't run into any trojans, however I had problems with the install process. Clicked on install.bat, and it opens a command window where some stuff happens (unpacking data files and such) then prompts to press any key. Once I press a key, it crashes my laptop (BSOD!). I restart the laptop and then the directories seem to be in the spot where things were unpacked, and when I start Kart.exe it seems to run, however I am running into some issues with running.  Some of the race events don't seem to be there, or at least the video isn't. I tried running through a career at the 100cc, and when I got to the New England short race, I was able to train/practice, but when I selected the qualification round, the screen just goes black, and I only hear the sounds.  I'm not sure if this has something to do with the install or not, but it is very frustrating.  I'm hoping that someone may have an idea on how to resolve this, as the game itself is fairly enjoyable!"
