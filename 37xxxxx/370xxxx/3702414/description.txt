(Incase you want to know that for whatever strange reason,
Not like anyone cares about those warnings)

Umm...Burn the contents of the folder, don't just burn the big main folder onto a disc, take it out of the big folder called BLACK, i only put it in that folder for neatness.

Before you complain it doesnt work, did you burn it to a DVD disc or a CD disc?
