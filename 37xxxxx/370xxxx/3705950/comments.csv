,IzzaTeza,2008-05-19T01:10Z,"Thank you so much for this! I've seen the show in London and loved it and now I can watch it whenever I want :) That still won't stop me from going to see it live again. The audio was great for a camvid, it's amazing you managed to hold the camera for so long! I loved the speech ""Glinda"" gave to the ones leaving the cast. Who played her, Fiyero, Boq and Mdm Morrible? "
,conscientous_pirate,2008-08-18T01:00Z,"Well, it was a good effort. The audio is pretty poor for a cam, you can understand what they are saying fine but the music is really rough. 

Video is pretty poor also, I guess not bad for an amateur cam. Seat is in the balcony so at least you can see everything despite it's blurriness.

Also zooms at times meaning you can't see other parts of the stage (not too big a deal since it only focuses on the main action anyway.)

Thanks anyway, the other commenter was right about one thing, if you were holding the cam, pretty good filming. Hope this is helpful to others."
,Breyvan,2009-07-31T02:00Z,"i agree with IzzaTeza, the audio is good and i like how it zooms in on the characters cause you get to see their expressions as well. all in all, its a good version to have :)"

,pumperz,2010-05-03T07:01Z,"Is there a way to contact the person who put this here? I want to thank them, but am clueless as to how all this works - thanks"
,groverjones,2010-05-05T16:55Z,"Thanks DarthEG.
I've not had a chance to see this before (it's playing on the wrong side of Australia), but this made me feel like I was there.
I don't care about the quality of the cam, it's the fact that someone has made the effort to record /and share/ it.  
Thanks!!!!"

,stewie2007,2011-07-10T01:27Z,"thanks for the torrent! watched this in London with idina menzel years ago, and i must say for any fellow UK downloaders, this is not half as good as the UK performance by idina. good torrent though if you have already seen it, but prepare to be slightly disapointed by the american version!"
,CoCountryBoy,2012-01-31T14:06Z,"The video quality is decent the zoom on the characters prevents you from seeing part of the stage. It is especially bad when Galinda is doing the ""make over"" as you can only see her most of the time, the audio when speaking is wonderful. When it comes down to the audio with music its hard to understand whats being said at some points. Though considering the length of the musical itself holding a camera that long and the location of the seats does make it hard to actually keep steady. Overall I would give it a 6/10 for this particular torrent. I am currently seeding this one and one other version of the musical"
,WhiskeyKid,2012-06-15T04:58Z,"Sound is horrible, shots are frequently blocked, video quality is grossly pixilated and is just no good.  Honestly there is no need to download this torrent as it has nothing to offer but disappointment.  Thank you for the up, DarthEG, but...
A: 2/10
V: 2/10"
