,pelle1953,2007-07-28T04:10Z,"Mr xh1r0
I have the same problem.
If you can find a working decoder 
somewhere on the net please tell us."
,IronBars,2007-08-10T19:55Z,anyone that got it working ?

,kelv1969,2008-04-20T14:42Z,I CAN'T BELIEVE ANY OF YOU ACTUALLY BOTHERED DOWNLOADING SUCH A HUGE VIDEO FILE!! ESPECIALLY AS THE ORIGINAL SOURCE FILE WAS PROBABLY JUST AN AVERAGE 720X576 DVD. WHY DID THE UPLOADER BOTHER 'REMUXING' THIS INTO A LARGE 'HD' FILE ANYWAY??? THEIR BLURAY MACHINE WOULD STRETCH THE PICTURE OUT TO FIT 'ON THE FLY'.  THE 700MB DVDRIPS OF THIS FILM ARE PROBABLY JUST AS GOOD. YOU WOULDN'T NOTICE A DIFFERENCE IN PICTURE QUALITY AND IT WOULDN'T TAKE YOU LONG TO DOWNLOAD. 30 TIMES LESS!!!!  
,Andrull,2008-06-12T02:47Z,"kelv1969, Why do you think its just an DVD-rip? Hellboy have been produced in Blu-Ray, and its not ann DVD-rip. 

Sorry to say it, but if you can't tell det difference on a 1080p Blu-Ray movie, and a 700-1GB sample, i would advice you to check the nearest doctor. Or you have to throw out that 15"" Travel-TV of yours. 
(maby both)
to scale dow HD to ""CD Quality"", is like having a nice, juicy steak and then tucking it up your ass before serving it. 

Caps-Lock idiot. "
,meat_mits,2008-06-14T07:40Z,"Exactly my thoughts Andrull.  If can't notice the difference between a HD movie and the regular version, you are either:
1) Watching it on a standard def TV

2) In denial that there is a difference between the two

3) Incapable of detecting the difference, which means you have to be close to being declared legally blind.

So kelv1969, which one are you?"
,cornerback1,2008-06-30T00:24Z,"can somebody please inform me as to how you can play this file on a Mac?

please and thank you  :)"
,Jeice,2008-08-13T17:42Z,"Kelv1969 is a fool! A fool I say!

Hard drive space isn't a big a deal right now. 1TB HD are actually close to dropping below $200. Hell, I got two hard drives, a 320g and a 500g right now and they cost me about $150 since I was able to get them on sale. 30g for a movie is nothing."
,maradnus,2008-11-02T03:24Z,"Well I got 1580GB here and I sitll wouldent download this as the film isnt even so good. I woud be happy to download it if the film was worth HD.

Lol"
