,lagerstarfish,2007-06-04T20:25Z,could you please seed again? we are all stuck on 48.2%. thanks.
,raidsiren,2007-11-22T21:32Z, lol weird its down after only being a up a few months ago. Any chance we can get a reseed of this?
,Labryn,2008-04-13T22:56Z,"Can anyone please seed just for a little while?  I am at 98.4% and even desperately added around 10 extra trackers just to see if that would find one...  but alas... no luck!   

If someone can help me get from 98.4%  to  100%

Then I will stay and seed for the next few days at least to help out the other 37 peers that are in the same boat as I am!

Thanks!
