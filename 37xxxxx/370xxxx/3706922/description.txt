Seeing as too many ripped versions available around on other p2p networks I decided to go with full CD version (CloneCD) with speech and audio tracks (brilliant music, those MIDIs from floppy/rips version aren't anywhere close to it). It's a DOS game so you can either try playing though DOSBox (will require tweaking configuration file) or you can play via LBAwin (included).
