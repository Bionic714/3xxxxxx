The client can be downloaded, precompiled and ready to run. DC++ runs best on Windows NT based operating systems. If you run Windows 95, 98, or ME, your experience may not be the same. If you have experience in C++ programming, the source code for DC++ is also available. Although DC++ is free, the tools for compiling it are not. You will need to purchase Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 in order to compile it. DC++ is distributed in English, but it comes with the ability to download a language file that translates DC++ into their own language. The "language file" link below hosts many such translations. Once the language file is downloaded, DC++ must be configured to use it though Settings ? Appearance ? Language File.
