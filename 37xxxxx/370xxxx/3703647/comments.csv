How can words describe it? Not very well, but we'll give it a try.
Probably the best way is to tell you what it means to us. For us it's all about emotion, power, meaning and about the transmission of these.
It's an explosion of feelings, and our aim is to share this experience with you. That's what it's all about.

vocals No bullshit here, it's all real. It's all about finding yourself, pain
and the problems we face every day making it easy to connect quickly. guitars Powerful, straight riffs with complex timing paired wih the pounding bass
form an incredible wall of sound pushing forward. It won't let you stand still. bass Perfectly complementing the guitar, ounding and stomping like a Chevy V8. Exactly the way it's meant to be. drums Speed, power, brilliant timing, incredible breaks & fast footwork. Combined with a groove of it's own, the drumming will leave you stunned.
