Like the cheeky director, Petr Lutsik, this film has some wonderfully bizarre moments, (I think you may be able to label it as surreal). Four farm men hit the road on a journey to the big smoky city and fight the powers that be. A wicked tale about an insane country going through some heavy changes.
