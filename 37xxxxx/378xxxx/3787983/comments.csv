,mrpijey,2007-08-29T18:38Z,It's just the beta drivers from ATI and nvidia to fix some issues with Bioshock. These are avaliable on their websites as well.
,barabusignasius,2007-08-29T19:14Z,you dont need these.  I tried playing with the old drivers and theres no difference. 
,barabusignasius,2007-08-29T19:15Z,and they caused instability in my system.  They are beta drivers after all.

The ATI hotfix drivers can be treated as Catalyst 7.9 betas - as that's what AMD's employee calls them."
