,ratty2e,2007-08-21T20:44Z,"Thanks Nesleman BUT er
 I didn't up that one!
think the thnxs belong to blankbox for that

thnxs Karj, hope it does as required 4 you. I'm waiting to build a PC that'll run FSX well...
Any VFR for that version would be gratefully received I'm sure.
Can you pls give feedback on this and if it works OK (IT SHOULD!) pls seed to release me to upload the rest....

Cheers

,neslesman,2007-08-22T03:41Z,"Yes, thanks for the correction and my apologies to blankbox.  And tanks again for this one ratty."
,rrodger99,2007-08-22T04:21Z,"So ratty,....you building youself a Cray Super Computer?

I thought I built a pretty decent system...8800GTS 2gb ram...hdds on a raid 0 & it still ran like crap.

Haven't tried it with the SP1 so maybe that will help."
,ratty2e,2007-08-22T09:22Z,"LOL rrodger99
I suspect FSX is just a series of screenshots with a glossy interface, the real program comes out with sp1!

AMD are releasing an 8Ghz sextuplet core CPU with 1Gig L2 cache specially for the game in 2018..... You heard it here first ;-)

I'm ready to up Vol 4 Northern England but want to confirm the first one was ok.......

,blankbox,2007-08-22T22:37Z,"...Thanx ratt2ye...looks good ...DAEMON knows what to do..looking forward to the North..

I've got the Horizon VFR Terrain...if anybody wants..think it works with these JF sets.."
,ratty2e,2007-08-23T11:54Z,"Thnxs for the feedback blankbox

It's curious that so many have downloaded (at least 20 by now) and your the only one to comment on install. Personally I would wait for confirmation from others b4 d\loading a large file like this.
Anyway I'll presume the lack of news is good news!
Here's the next:-

,ratty2e,2007-08-26T22:29Z,"Hope your all finding these usefull. Thanks to all you seeders.

I'm gonna give my hard drive a rest for a few days. Please check back here start of next month....."
,eliminators,2007-08-27T00:09Z,Installed just fine. As did Vol 4 North. Many thanks. 
,ratty2e,2007-09-04T22:40Z,"For those interested Vol 3 SW & Wales:-

,jabbaru,2007-09-07T00:14Z,funny this is supposed to be for FS2004 but it asked for FS2002...
,ratty2e,2007-09-07T02:10Z,"Jabbanu
Read my description  at the top!
It states:-
""It's actually the FS2002 version but is the same as FS2004 I believe.
You'll need to run the FS2002_is_here.exe to install to FS2004 versions, this is in a folder on the 3rd disc with other useful utilities ;)""

Read the instructions then run the FS2002_is_here exe before trying to install the VFR discs. The exe sets an entry in the registry so the FS2002 installer is fooled into using the FS2004 directory. This isn't some pirate hack it's an official workround provided by Just Flight, I've included it to make the install easy....
Run the FS2004_is_here once everything is installed to set the registry pointer back

Sound of the patient sigh of a father for his eager but foolish child......"
,SteveAndrew123,2007-09-07T04:00Z,"Installed fine for me, using FS2004, Many thanks Ratty. Looking forward to central and southern UK to complete the set :)"
,bruggemann,2007-09-16T16:55Z,"hi ratty2e,

winrar canÂ´t open disk2.iso ( unknown format or damaged , it says ) any advice here ? thanks"
,neslesman,2007-09-17T21:56Z,The install works great 
,ratty2e,2007-09-18T15:55Z,"Hi Bruggermann
Others here as you can read have installed OK so it's your own rar thats corrupt by the looks of things. Don't know what to suggest at this stage, as you can't open it you can't use powerISO to inspect the 3 files it contains...
Have you tried the winrar repair tool?"
,bruggemann,2007-10-03T01:05Z,"hi ratty2e,

Ive reinstalled Winrar, Ive installed Powerarchiver, Ive downloaded VFR vol1 , 3 times but still wont work 
VFRDISK2.ISO seems to be the problem, winrar analyses it  as only 96% complete. 
For your info, the size of the VFRDISK2.ISO I have is 579MB or 607.305.216 bytes.

cheers
bruggermann"
,ratty2e,2007-10-04T20:14Z,"Hi Bruggermann

as your so polite I'll upload the disc 2 iso to TPB this friday 5 -10 - 07. I'll leave it running for a week for you, please confirm when you've downloaded it so I can remove it Unless of course any one else is having the same problem...

I ran out of disc space last month which is why the final vol hasn't been upped!
I now have a Terabyte Raid server setup so thats resolved my storage issues.
Will up the  final volume (Central England) of this series over the weekend.
Cheers All"
,ratty2e,2007-10-04T20:34Z,"Bruggermann
I've checked and the byte count of 607.305.216 bytes is correct
 Install PowerISO (available on TPB) and confirm the 3 files are:-
autorun.inf     1KB
data3.cab      516000KB
Start.ico        13KB
See if it allows you to mount or burn, if it does you can run an install and it may let us know what is missing if anything
That would save having to up the full 500MB!

Cheers 
ratty2e
See if PowerISO opens the cab"
,Goulash,2007-10-10T09:36Z,"Actually its irrelevant when you install whether you have FS2002 or FS2004, just point your browser to your FS folder and it picks up on the location of the exe file. For those that don't know or don't pay attention, there's a 2002exe file already included in your main FS folder when you install flightsim. 

On another note, these iso files all work fine, no problems with the other scenery versions either. Any chance of Volume 2 to complete the set?"
,ratty2e,2007-10-18T21:45Z,"Hi Goulash

Thanks for comment, Vol2 is now up here:-

,pauljohnriley,2008-01-21T18:28Z,ive done everything as asked but wen go to start set up the main page comes up and starts to install but at the end it says  failed to load dll fstype and terminates  can anyone help plz  i have vista premium and fs9
,ratty2e,2008-01-28T11:56Z,"Hi JohnPaul
I have only tested these VFR series  on XP but they all install fine.
I don't use vista so can only give you rough guidance here. First off, have you sucessfully installed any of the others?
Vista is very keen on security, you are definitely admin rights during install?
Read through the  comments given for all four of my uploads, and  try the fs2000_is_here fix (in spite of Goulash's comments!!)
If all else fails you can manually add the scenery and mesh files (do a google on it for description) tiresome I know but it does work...

Let me know how it goes, any vista users out there able to shed light?

,Petrovsky19,2008-05-16T06:26Z,Could anyone pls tell me how to add it manually Im not able to install it automatically. I've search on google but i found no info about how to install manually. thx sooo much
