FS2004 VFR Photographic Scenery Vol1 E & SE



Inspired by the herioc failure of flightcrazy here is Vol 1 East and SouthEast England

rar with 3 discs of ISO's built using alcohol 120%

It's actually the FS2002 version but is the same as FS2004 I believe.
You'll need to run the FS2002_is_here.exe to install to FS2004 versions, this is in a folder on the 3rd disc with other useful utilities ;)

As soon as it has 2 other seeders I'll up each succesive vol in turn (have all 4)

Thoroughly tested, burn to cd with Nero & go or just mount using Daemon Tools 

Please can early adopters  give feedback!

And Purleese seed, I have about 45K up max...

Will start seeding as soon as a request comes in
