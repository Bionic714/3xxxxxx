,vhg,2007-08-25T11:11Z,"Technical details please.. like Video, Audio, subtitles, features etc"
,manborn,2007-08-25T15:19Z,"ya, what ^he said"
,russell1nash,2007-08-25T16:00Z,"u MUST be joking, putting this up here without any tech specs... "
,gcq,2007-08-25T19:38Z,"Yawn.  No I'm not joking and last night could not be bothered with posting the specs.  Normally I would have provided the details but a friend dropped this off last night and I wanted to share it.  Besides I think it's funny that 99% of the comments complaining about specs and such are always from leeches who don't bother to post a damn thing and expect the rest of the world to provide for their enjoyment.    

Maybe if the comments came from actual seeders I would take them seriously, but from a bunch of leeches, all I can say is thanks for the laugh!  

For the rest, no Subtitles. NTSC. mpegv/a52. 2:03:17"
,grothras,2007-09-07T15:33Z,OMG! so bad. Decode to fit all screens! It sucks bigtime to have only a quarter of the screen filled with the picture. this movie can only be seen correctly on 4:3 screens.
