,uau5,2008-03-23T06:13Z,File does not open. bs.
,uau5,2008-03-23T06:23Z,"both quicktime and divx player did not recognize this file as a video format (no matter what extension I put on it). but for some reason toast was able to recognize it then convert it to divx... 

worked fine after that."
,ethan420,2008-03-29T15:55Z,"uau5: it worked fine before that, you probably did not have the proper codecs, do a fucking google search before u call something ""bs"""
,optein,2008-06-23T18:48Z,"I also had trouble opening the file up in quicktime and with WMV with the proper codec. VLC worked great tho, as always."
,optein,2008-06-23T18:49Z,"I also really like this movie, thanks for uploading. Shows the positive as well as negative aspects of deadhead culture. "
