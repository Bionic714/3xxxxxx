Embedded computing Design is your resource for the latest news, engineering methods, products, and tools necessary for design of small embedded modules to your distributed, large-scale embedded systems geared to such applications as:

* Industrial automation and control
* Networking and storage
* Security
* Military and aerospace
* Wireless communications/telecommunications
* Internet
* Medical
* Mobile
* Test and measurement

Included in these types of embedded applications are components such as RTOSes, Linux, FPGAs, fabrics, WAN/LAN, boards, blades, servers, high availability, and DSP chips, all of which we will cover in the magazine articles and product guides.

Along with our industry news and Linux news columns, we will feature columns that promote open systems standards, covering the efforts of consortiums and working groups such as the Open Source Development Lab (OSDL) and the Carrier Grade Linux working group. We will feature a new Embedded Microsoft column as well.

-LEGAL TORRENTS

Purpose:

create a balance, share the already free stuff,
public domain works, freeware, free music,
free ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.

show the copyright owners that torrent
websites shouldn't bear the responsibility
of what their users upload, torrent websites
are very much similar to google..

users upload what they want to upload,
download what they want to download,
and search for what they want to search..

by creating this balance and sharing the already free
stuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..
