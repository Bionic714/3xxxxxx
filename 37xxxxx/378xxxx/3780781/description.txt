A Tale of Winter is the second installment in Eric Rohmer's Tales of the Four Seasons. FÃ©licie (Charlotte VÃ©ry) and Charles (FrÃ©dÃ©ric Van Den Driessche) had a brief affair during a seaside vacation. Then Charles went abroad on business, and FÃ©licie gave him her address so they could stay in touch; however, she made an unexplainable mistake in the address and has lost all trace of her lover. Five years later, she is still single and raising a daughter by Charles. Though she is courted both by her no-nonsense boss, Maxence (Michel Voletti), and her highbrow friend Loic (HervÃ© Furic), she is still in love with Charles and hopes to meet him again.
