,Digital_G0ddess,2008-10-17T08:31Z,"I ""got it"" that you are supposed to move the .exe file into the Decoz folder... it cracks the features, but then stops working after a day or so.
Nice try. Wish there was a crack that works."

This is a good good stuff just it reset the settings after few time which can be recovered in few clicks only. I'm using it from 5-7 days and nothing went wrong except setting.
Just check the settings and preference before generating the report"
