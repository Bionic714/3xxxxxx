Zeke is a hardcore punk band from Tacoma, Washington USA. They are known for their extremely high-powered, driving guitar sound, mixed with blues-rock influences and are therefore sometimes compared to MotÃ?Â¶rhead.[1][2] Zeke released their first single, West Seattle Acid Party, in 1993; after several album releases on indie label Scooch Pooch Records, they signed with Epitaph in 1998 which led to nationwide fame in punk rock circles. They are currently signed to Relapse Records.

The song \"Death Alley\" was on Tony Hawk\'s Pro Skater 4, the song \"Long Train Runnin\'\" appeared on Tony Hawk\'s Underground 2, and \"Kill the King\" recently appeared on Tony Hawk\'s Project 8.
