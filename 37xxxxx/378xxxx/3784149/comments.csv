,slayerp,2008-08-18T20:56Z,"What codec do you use to play these? I have tried the following codec packs, and every single one skips and jumps every other minute on every single episode!!!

Codec Pack (Supports DivX 5.0.5 Pro, XviD, 3ivx, MPEG2, OGG, MP3, AC3 & More) by PappNase.exe

ffdshow_rev1579_20071026_xxl.exe

GordianKnot.Codec.Pack.1.9.Setup.exe

K-LiteCodec204.exe

W.E.C.P.Codec.Package.Setup.exe

XP Codec Pack 1.1.0.exe

XviD-1.1.3-28062007.exe

I have had no problems playing any other downloaded videos, ever!"
,Keyholder,2008-08-19T04:00Z,"@ SLAYERP

Dude, snds like u need to format ur pc, as it runs fine even on the standard K lite codec package, & xp codec pack.

as for it skipping every other min, its probs something to do with ur pc trying to read ahead etc.

Theres nothing wrong with any of them for me even before they were all completed, they played fine :-) and quality is great "
,slayerp,2008-09-16T13:41Z,"Junk, every file skips and hiccups, terrible encode. Tried 4 different portable and VCR hardware DVD players, they all do the same thing."
,waelabdo,2008-09-26T08:02Z,"hey Nite,

Its me snake_eyes :)

it has been a long time man

i have just found your amazing torrent and the quality is superb as usual 

thanks man "
,LOKI_LOKI,2008-10-03T17:20Z,Thanks for posting this.  Each episode so far plays great.  For those of you saying that the video is choppy or jumps / skips around try turning off your torrent downloads while you are watching the videos.  If you're sharing this at the same time as you're trying to watch it there's a good chance it'll interfere with the quality of your video playback.  Just make sure to begin seeding again when you're not watching the episodes ;-)
,waelabdo,2008-10-15T11:24Z,"to get the seasons extras :

,LOKI_LOKI,2008-10-16T04:30Z,"Another suggestion to help with this.  If you're like me and you want to watch these as they come down.  You can set the torrent program not to download some of the episodes and only download what you want to watch thus forcing it to say download season 1 or whatever order you want to watch it in.  Then copy those episodes that you will watch to another hard drive that is not the one where your torrents are being downloaded to.  Then go back to the torrent program and select more episodes for it to download.  This way you get the opportunity to watch them while the rest of the torrent is downloading.  I've opened my bandwidth up all the way for this seeding close to 180kbs at times.  I've also successfully downloaded the first 5 seasons and I'm working on 6 & 7 now.  I've already watched seasons 1, 2 & half of 3.  I love this, thanks again NiteShdw!!"
,sterreappeltje,2008-10-21T10:51Z,"I don't know whats wrong with these AVI files but I still get the message  Cannot render the file at music player classic, even after the downloading the newest codec from K-lite... Help me please!"

I will reseed /upload @ 50 - 60kbs between 10pm - 8am. London  / Uk time. 

When i have uploaded yet another 30GB then i will stop seeding again !

Seems as if there are so many leechers about today :( 

Seeders are what keep places like the Pirate bay OPEN !!!

Keyholder :)"
,Craskill,2009-02-21T05:26Z,"Will seed as long as I can. Please seed, need faster downloads."
,aduderface,2009-06-01T10:17Z,"20 seeders and 120 leechers..... this shit was the same with other star trek series torrents- huge huge difference in the number of seeders vs leechers.  these torrents have been around for a long time too, over a year...

only brings me to one conclusion:

star trek fans = greedy fuckers.  who knew?"
,primalclaws1974,2009-06-04T09:21Z,What's this bs that each season can fit on a DVD? This is about half what other complete Voyager series run. Is this poor quality or made for a phone or Ipod?
,reggiesboy,2009-06-10T13:31Z,please seed..will oblige and re-seed :) 
,GungaDan,2009-11-24T15:58Z,"Please seed, and once I have it, I will do the same. Thanks."
,perki_,2010-03-12T17:52Z,"Please seeeeeeed, im downloading for 2.5 days , 1 more day to go ...... once I have it, I will do the same.  
Thanks."
,Slyde83,2010-03-23T01:47Z,Please if you have this file I need seeders. 
,Stevena21,2010-05-01T02:42Z,"Thanks for this torrent but a few more seeders would be appreciated, only getting 30KB/s download when i know i can get 850KB/s down, if you can increase your speed on this old torrent please do so. And i am a member of seed to stay sites so i will continue to seed up to 200% after download is completed, i know how this shit works for us public guys, if anyone can help to increase thanks in advance :)"
,Stevena21,2010-05-01T03:35Z,"Thanks for the extra speed whoever is doing it, even if you don't know you are i wanna thank you, i'm only up to 100KB/s but every little bit of extra speed is worth it and even though i can only offer a max of 40KB/s i will keep seeding at that speed cos i know that every little bit makes it better for other people, and if you don't want to give other people the same happiness you get then there aint no point doing it is there."
,DoC_WeBNet,2010-07-02T05:47Z,"For you Lame Blokes out there, these are in AVI format not in DvD9 mode so yes you can fit them on one disk per season. Furthermore i am re-downloading it again for archival purposes and i am getting nice speeds off and on. Great job guys keep it up :)"
,jakewvulaw,2010-08-13T03:34Z,"Thanks NiteShdw, all 7 seasons, outstanding!"
