Movie description
In 2002, rock icon Peter Gabriel went on tour to promote his critically acclaimed album UP. Dubbed the "Growing Up Live" tour, the name proved to be prophetic, as Gabriel's 28-year-old daughter Anna tagged along with camera in hand to document her father's personal life on the road. The resulting documentary, GROWING UP ON TOUR: A FAMILY PORTRAIT, offers an intimate snapshot of Gabriel's struggle to balance the demands of touring with his familial obligations to his two grown-up daughters and new wife and baby, all of whom joined him on the road. Interspersing live performance footage and candid interviews with the Gabriel clan, Anna's film offers a unique perspective on the modern-day tug-of-war between career and family.
