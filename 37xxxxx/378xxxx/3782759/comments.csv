,deamonseed,2007-08-24T20:47Z,"Small rewrite of your instructions

3. Copy files from crack to adobe/acrobat 8.0/acrobat

Also, make sure it copies over the existing files. For some reason when I did a drag and drop it did not prompt me to copy over them. Not sure if it is something with XP or my computer was just acting weird, but I thought I would throw that out.

I know it is stupid and small, but I am an idiot proofer at work. I write instruction manuals for a living."
,deamonseed,2007-08-24T20:48Z,"Forgot to say thanks by the way, so THANKS!"
,patnemsam,2007-08-27T14:43Z,"Tried this with acrobat 8 Pro from Adobe Design Premium but no luck. Got the message ...... er...wow just went to read the message again, and Acrobat now seems to be working just fine. Thank you very much! "
,patnemsam,2007-08-27T14:55Z,"Oh dear, I need to retract my last comment! the dialog box telling me to open another one of creative suite's main apps has returned and rendered Acrobat useless again. Any Ideas anyone?"
,avp55,2007-08-27T17:09Z,"nope no ideas in my little brain.

,coriolanos,2007-09-03T23:16Z,"Keygen works fine, but the version may be a bit unstable: In two days I had 6 error, either from ""drs832.dll"" or from ""acrobat.dll""."
,myster_zav,2007-09-15T07:42Z,"Thanks for the app, it seems to be working fine. I downloaded Acrob 8 pro from someone else, together with a keygen, but the one they were giving didn't work, or at least I couldn't use it.
I installed the software and got the evaluation registration, and today I tried this crack.
I didn't get the '30 days remaining' message when I ran Acrob, I didn't complete the registration form, nevertheless I had Adobe Updater up and running.

I'll let you know next month if it is still operating.

Chers,
