Dying to Have Known

Filmmaker, Stephen Kroschel, sets out to find hard evidence of the effectiveness of the Gerson Therapy, a long-suppressed natual cancer treatment. His travels take him across both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, from upstate New York to San Diego to Alaska, from Japan to Holland and Mexico. In the end, he presents the testimony of patients, scientists, surgeons and nutritionists, who testify to the effectiveness of the Gerson Therapy and shows the hard scientific evidence to back up their claims.

The question that remains is, Why is this powerful curative therapy still suppressed, more than 75 years after it was clearly proven to cure degenerative disease?

If this documentary is not immediately suppressed, millions of chronically-ill people will get well. - Andrew Saul, Asst. Editor, Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine


It's just exquisite! Deft to the point of sublime. A major step forward.
- John Robbins, Author, Diet for a New America, Reclaiming Our Health
