[V],Subzero!,2007-08-22T03:46Z,"Special Info Note:

Some virus-scanner recognize the header of packed exe's (bob1 + bob2.exe)

as a lame virus, (coz it's the mostly byte by byte check error of 'em!.)

This is truly a false information!,  a so called false positive, you can read

more about in your VirusTool-Manual or WebSite!.

,Divelucaya,2007-10-09T20:05Z,"Both bob1.exe and bob2.exe produce the following error: ""Unable to load movie playlist. Does the .INI file exist?  It must contain a section '[Movies]' with an entry 'Movie01=Pathname.dir'."" There was no .INI file included.  However, when I ran Movies.exe, several files were added to the folder, one being GroovePlayer.ini but it did not have a [Movies] section.

Anyone else have luck running either program?"

All it does it shows some stupid screen from the guy that created it and never loads the game.
Waste of time as mentioned."

Waste of time as mentioned. You have to use Control Alt Delete to get out of the stupid screen that it shows which I think is an installer screen that just hangs."
