,TheFirstMan,2007-10-25T16:29Z,"deathmetalmp3s: Well, it's cool that you share this movie with us, BUT: why the heck did you change the AVI-filename? Is the real filename just ""Der.Todesking.1990.DVDRip.XviD.DualMP3.INC.EXTRAS-KamuiX.avi""? Just so I can change it back. I prefer releases unaltered :)

And also, the NFO says there are lots of extras included, like a ""Making of""-featurette. Where are they?? Why didn't you include them? I'd love to see them!!

So my question is: is there ANY chance that you re-upload this release with all the original bonus material, with the original filenames of everything? That would be fantastic.

BTW: I'm also a Jรถrg Buttgereit fan :)"
