Hi,

This is a DVD rip of The War Tapes brougd out in 2006. This movie is a real documentery about the US soldiers of the National Guard who are being send out in Iraq. In Iraq they film a year long where they go throug. They let you see anything. Battle's, wounded soldiers and even dead people. Also you their families during the soldiers stay in Iraq.

There are no subtitles included and i can't give you any specific information about the vid, i only can say that you can trust me that the quality of sound and video is great. It's a DVD-rip and it's just exelent!

I've got respect for the man and women servering for not only the US army but every army which is currently involved in Iraq. They do a hell of a job. I'm proud there are people like this walking around there. I think it's very important that everybody should see this documentery, that's the reason i uploaded a torrent. You can buy it and support but also download if you don't have the money.

Kind Regards,
