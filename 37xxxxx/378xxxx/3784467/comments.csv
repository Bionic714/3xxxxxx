,gracey,2007-08-26T10:32Z,quality anyone
,RainbowDL,2007-08-26T13:03Z,Quality is great (sound and picture) - DVD rip as reported
,sallamator,2007-08-27T03:38Z,"Quality is very good. Audio, video both fine. Thanks  for upload, i will seed."
,Christley,2007-08-27T18:12Z,"i'm very suspicious about the sound... 191kb/s vbr. a new dvd always has ac3, 5.1. this one don't got it. i think this is a r5 since this don't have gotten to stores. not even china or USA"
,ylzik,2007-08-28T11:54Z,"why is this only 119 minutes long? have some scenes been cut or is the imdb profile just erroneous? just really curious since i havent seen this at the cinema. by the way, quality is great.
thanks uploader!"
,ruprechtus,2007-08-28T12:00Z,V9/A9 very good copy! Thank you!
,nft,2007-08-28T12:32Z,Does anyone know where to find subs?
,mixim,2007-08-28T15:10Z,"Okey, let me lay this down: The Videoquality is definetly at DVD-Rip quality... But the sound is from a screener /R5 or whatever... it's at high bitrate but sound-source is very weak... watchable thanks to the good video quality!"
,mixim,2007-08-28T16:47Z,The movie has chopped of scenes! You can spot it at least 2 times.
,Djfuckface,2007-08-28T21:42Z,"Picture's ok, but the sound's terrible ... not at all better than the R5 release. I'll wait for a proper dvdrip.
Video 7/10
Audio 5/10"
,Danstah8,2007-08-29T15:07Z,Anyone has subs for this movie in english or danish?
,bakeme,2007-08-30T02:36Z,this isn't knocked up. I got a mobie called Fracture and it can only be played in 3wplayer wtf?
,Bastich,2007-08-30T18:20Z,"Check out the busted McD commercial! We love to kill!!!!

Excellent work by robotron.vid!"
,randomguy12,2007-08-30T23:29Z,someone please post the link from rlslog or a site like that so we can have info on this release
,Jesupojk,2007-08-31T09:00Z,"Pro-life shit, but still ok. Dont watch it with your girlfriend. Dont let your girlfriend watch it. Keep it away from your GF, ok? What i mean is that girls shouldnt be allowed to see this. "
,randomguy12,2007-09-01T05:04Z,"good audio, video somewhat blurry compared to a true dvdrip, very slightly out of sync at times

definitely watchable and a good overall copy"
,Flarie,2007-09-02T18:10Z,"In the scene with the McDonalds ""We Love To Kill"" TV ad, on the wall behind the bearded guy, there is a black banner that seems superimposed.

Both the TV ad and this banner do not belong in the movie right?

I wonder what is playing in the TV instead."
,NFN_NLN,2007-09-03T00:58Z,Thanks for the informative review mixim.  I will wait for a true DVDRip.
,puggy,2007-09-03T01:56Z,To those saying the audio is 10/10--clean your fucking ears. De-grease those funky eardrums of yours. The shit crackles and pops on medium volume and the bitrate is way too low.
,badalhoca,2007-09-04T02:29Z,"VERY NICE movie!
VERY interesting.

Great quality also.

Nice torrent"
,Painter21,2007-09-04T04:57Z,what is R5?
,jakuriaev,2007-09-04T17:05Z,"Thank you for perfect quality, very nice rip and great movie.

@for idiots here - write comment after you see movie, not before..."
,piratepay,2007-09-04T18:07Z,"woot, this movie is about me! Bongs up!"
,axwell 23,2007-09-04T20:38Z,"highly recommended upload... picture 10/10 sound 10/10.. might not be a dvd rip but its as good as.. thanks uploader.
Good work."
,drewgarrett,2007-09-05T04:57Z,Video 7/10. Audio 4/10.  There's NO reason to shrink audio- especially if you aren't going to make it less than 700mb. I'll wait for -aXXo rip.
,5cardstud,2007-09-06T05:39Z,"Excellent audio and video throughout! Seems like a great DVDRip to me. Fix your codecs, people!
