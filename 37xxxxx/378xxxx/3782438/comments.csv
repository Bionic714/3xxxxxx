It had a hateful, one-sided message that the Jews are the only aggressors and the Palestinians have no blame for the lack of peace in Israel, that any terrorist action is just a result of the so called ?occupation.? The fact is the movie was littered with anti-Semitism and omissions of dire truths about U.S. foreign aid to Israel and aggression pursued by the Palestinians onto the Israelis.""

,bigfhead,2008-02-25T04:00Z,"Actually, if you watched the whole movie tomtomx, you would see that it definitely wasn't hateful and it was in fact very informative of the lifestyle of the average palestinian. In addition, many of the interviews were with non-palestinian, non-muslim congressmen, congresswomen and highly regarded individuals working with Amnesty International. Who do I believe? You... or them? Hmmm"
,bigfhead,2008-02-25T04:28Z,"By the way tomtomx, why would you quote a first year political science major? I've seen some of your posts... you don't seem too bright."
