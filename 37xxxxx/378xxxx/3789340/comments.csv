,jasonp22,2007-09-01T11:26Z,if you had any common sence its obviously not windows xp the full installation lol it would take about 20minutes to boot up if it was also yes it is like a offline webpage  but has many features that is a must to try and also if you dont like the torrent then go elsewhere stop bitching
,DJControllic,2007-09-01T15:22Z,"Confirmed to be NOT a Virus

If u dont now something sure dont say it"
,jasonp22,2007-09-01T20:50Z,thanks DJControllic For clarifying that the upload has no virus :D
,twinpeak,2007-09-23T12:22Z,"I tend to agree with johnbrad1968

A virus is something else than it appears to be..

Stupid title .. Windows Xp For PSP"

You don't know what a virus is!! So stop bitching.

A virus is a program whit dangerous code implemented in the software. And has nothing to do whit this! "
,c0ng0bong0,2007-10-19T14:27Z,"You would have to be crazy to download this. First ask yourself how did they get access to Microsoft's source code? Second, how could they take massively bloated software and get it to run on a little PSP in 1MB? That ability alone would be worth a fortune. Third... how did they get port a x86 CPU OS to a MIPS CPU? These guys would have to be the greatest coders of all time."

there offline webpages that emulate windows xp.....god all of you are fucking dumbasses. why did you have make it rocket science......its exactly what the title says...(although i thought the file was like...15Mb) anyways, do some research before you make your self look like a total cock ass"
,Ultima3000,2007-11-23T02:32Z,"I can confirm that this is NOT any virus or a trojan as 1 person put. This is like a web page with features which emulate Windows XP. As someone said about getting source code they obviously don't know what they are talking about. There is no need for source code... It isn't an operating system as such. And it is so small because it is only an offline web page with direct links to features. I really hate it when people come across minor errors and automatically presume it must be a virus. I scaned this using AVG, Norton and AD Aware SE. It is not a virus and contains no spyware or adware."
,Andreaz,2007-12-14T00:47Z,"the webpage psxexplosion dont work is the page down or is there some other problem, would be nice to see som screenies of this thing"
,robbindahood,2007-12-16T10:42Z,Next time please put in that it's a portal cause thats how you call these off-line pages
,joel8520,2008-02-08T02:14Z,Even if it were like 500 freaking megabytes do you actually think a PSP could run it??? Retards. It's obviously offline pages
,Heromist,2011-10-05T05:54Z,wtf people?! i need seeders!!
