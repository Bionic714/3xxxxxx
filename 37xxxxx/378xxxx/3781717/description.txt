\"In the early 70\'s Pete Bardens and Andy Latimer forged a music style that would break ground and influence generations until this very day. Supported by a strong keyboard foundation, the guitar has a prominent whole in the music. The drumming style of Andy Ward gives the final signature to their music, not to mention the beautiful voice of Latimer, and his sweet flute as well. Influences from Jazz to Pop/Rock are found on this massive melodical and symphonic universe that is CAMEL\'s music.\" (From www.progarchives.com)
