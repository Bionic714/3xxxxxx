,bigbob7,2008-05-05T21:44Z,Excellent download...did you take this course?
,TimeStopper,2008-06-05T18:28Z,This is good stuff. But how does the program work?
,blumppin12,2008-07-18T11:55Z,"Remember guys,
 This  torrent is worth $297 and I recommend you buy this from the website www.pmemory.com because you get support from the indivudials who are using this course.Also the money is worth it considering the benefit it gives...if you download this from here,then you have to use these all by yourself without anybody's help and you cannot ask any questions the arises during the study of this course."
,vrydetta,2008-08-19T15:06Z,"I'm actually a little guilty for downloading this. But it's just that i don't have enough money to buy this but i badly need it to proceed to law school and bring up my poor family. I won't fail to give the credits anyway. I owe you this, tliachento"
,TimeStopper,2008-08-31T22:35Z,"vrydetta, I hope you have more success than I did with this. It's too time consuming.

I really do want a great memory, I just can't put in the time."
,TimeStopper,2008-09-01T02:38Z,"Secondly, according to the guy who runs the ""School of Phenomenal Memory"" the Course 1.0 (this one) is supposed to be used with support (forums)."

,Salibin,2009-05-20T18:33Z,"Hey all!

I didnt read this book, if it tells ya how to memorize using imagery system >>>ITS WORTH IT! I didnt read any books before trying to use images as a base for material which must be memorized. Images make me better and faster. Its just a magic. Instead writing or reading 10000000000k times just try to image and keep it in your memory. Image will never betray you, Just try,

i think this book must be interesting."
,blumppin12,2009-06-07T07:23Z,"Another thing that I must say about this course is that this course takes a hell a lot of time....!

 This course is not for those who just give up after some series of challenging exercises( at some point in the course, you have to memorize information at about 100 images in a given amount of time...)

So download this torrent if you want to really improve your memory.... "
,blumppin12,2009-06-07T07:26Z,By the way the person named fainaent who gave a comment on this torrent is an instructor of this updated course which is available now from www.pmemory.com
,dinamy,2010-01-01T10:59Z,"Could someone share the new 2.0 version of this course? Or there is no big difference?

Also, what are these Pseudo technical Exercises?
Could it be reuplodaed to somewhere?

Thank you very much!"
,slashelias,2010-02-23T20:01Z,"Thanks for the download. I can not afford to pay for the program through the school. I'm and unemployed father of 4. I'm on lesson 15 and the program is nothing short of amazing.

Does anyone have a copy of the figurative codes reference book for 3 digits?

Thanks in advance!"
