,Tripps77,2007-08-22T07:33Z,"Btw, it should say that Siddhartha was from India, not Nepal.  I didn't write the description, but I suppose I should've proofread the whole thing."

Buddha actually *was* born in Lumbini, located in what today is Nepal.

,sexprospector,2007-12-11T05:46Z,I love this movie! I'm so glad I've found it here :) it is hard to find.
,wolvy23,2008-06-14T19:43Z,"This is the most positive, spiritual movies I've ever seen.  It changed my life.  This one and The Fisher King.  
Oddly though, try watching this movie, and then The Devil's Advocate back to back.  Its amazing the similarities you'll spot.  Then Neo in the Matrix.  Keanu Reeves definitly has a pattern for Buddhist movies."
,ilovenepal,2009-09-19T18:25Z,"Of Course, Lord Buddha was born in Nepal. But I don't know these ....... indians comment that he was born in India. I think they don't know the history like the film maker of CC2C. "

,fleetkid,2009-11-25T17:13Z,Naive people. When Buddha was born there was no Nepal or India... Just the Indian Subcontinent... Scholars are still trying to pinpoint His birth place...

,partycrasher131,2010-03-02T18:22Z,hey This topic about where buddha was born is debatable...so....
,partycrasher131,2010-03-02T18:24Z,But i really think we should be talkin bout the present context and not the old one.....so if this movie shows that he was born in india then i totally disagree with it...
,om.mani,2010-03-04T19:18Z,Thanks a lot!
,markysre,2011-01-03T21:02Z,Thanks Sir
