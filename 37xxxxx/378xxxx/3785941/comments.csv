,SDnikko,2008-01-07T18:34Z,"The end of the 7th symphony and all of the 8th symphony seem to be missing.  The file is small for that CD.  Any ideas?

Anyway,  most of it is intact and the recordings are outstanding.  Thank you darkriser."
,SDnikko,2008-01-07T18:43Z,Re;  FLAC files.  These can be converted to mp3 and other formats using the Xilisoft Audio Converter 2.1.68.1229 which is seeding on Pirate Bay.
,SDnikko,2008-01-07T20:50Z,I reloaded the torrent from scratch and it picked up the missing pieces.  Thanks again.
,dimmer1,2008-03-03T19:07Z,"Can those cd's be copied to normal cd's - as they are SACD..?
Thanks for upload!"
,frankBIG,2008-04-12T19:35Z,"Thank You !! Thank You !! Thank You !!
Thanks for sharing such great music !!"
,pappe,2008-04-14T20:47Z,"44.100 Hz 16 bit stereo.
So, not SACD."
,cometaz,2008-05-22T21:09Z,Very good sound! Thank you very much!
,777shanktime777,2008-05-28T12:56Z,too bad you ripped the complete cd as a single flac file instead of track by track.
,dmoss74,2008-08-18T23:21Z,"these are ripped sequentially, not as the collection was actually presented. I have re-ripped them in their proper order, so i could burn the CDs with the proper IDs.  If you want to do so, you will need a decent wav editor. i used wavelab.

thanks though, these were timeless performances. "
[T],exit-reality,2009-05-04T00:55Z,It be nice if it was 24 bit and 96 or 192khz so it would actually sound close to the actuall sacd. My CD's sound better than this.
,carblueberry,2012-01-02T05:10Z,"Good quality. Thank You.

BUT.........

These don't seem to be real SACD. OR it has been reduced down to the quality of a normal CD.

All files are 16bit 44.1KHz. 

Normally SACD will be 24bit and 96KHz (sometimes even 196KHz). This makes a big difference to the audio."
