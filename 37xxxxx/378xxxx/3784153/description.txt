A Powerful Documentary, 17 August 2007


Author: JoeTorn_starr51 from United States 

Following the lives of three drug addicts in 90's Lowell, director Richard Farrell takes the viewer on a gritty uncut look at the declining life of three people. 

A powerful anti-drug film that could be a companion piece to Requiem for a Dream, it is a MUST SEE for all documentary filmmakers. 

A film based on the life of one of the addicts, boxer Micky Ward, is soon to begin filming with Mark Wahlberg as Micky and Matt Damon as his brother Dick Eklund. 

As an alum of Farrell's film class in Andover, Maâ?¦I wish him good luck on his future projects.
