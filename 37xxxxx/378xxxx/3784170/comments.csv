There seem to be a problem with the flightplanning and human factors books, or is it my computer? It says unable to read file, with acrobat 7.0.

Does someone have the complete file?"

Those two files are damaged! I managed to to recover one of them using the program ""Advanced PDF repair"", but Human Performance has a real problem! It says that it is not a PDF!!!
So I would like to ask ""tomcom2k"" just to check the file and if it is possible to seed it again! Once you renew it please let us know!!!"
,jimbob292,2007-09-08T20:21Z,"tomcom2k Thanks very much for uploading these files!!!!!

I will seed as long as possible.

Could you please check files JAA ATPL BOOK 7- Oxford Aviation Jeppesen-- Flight Planning And Monitoring & Jaa Atpl Book 8 - Oxford Aviation Jeppesen - Human Performance.

As I cannot open them, tried to use PDF recovery but I wasn?t able to save the documents, any help would be great.

Cheers

,Kax2,2007-09-16T21:42Z,Amazing! And here I was just sitting scanning Human Performances... :-) Seems I can hold on that for a while until I see if all books really can be opened. Thaks for the share man.
,Kax2,2007-09-20T19:53Z,"Some info about the books:

These are all the books in the Oxford/Jeppesen series. 

They are from the time when Oxford and Jeppesen still had not went separate ways. There are 14 books all in all*, plus one presentation. 

These books were originally printed in 2001 but here we have the second edition from 2002. 

All books but Communication seem to have been scanned in color.

*In the new Oxford series there is also a 15:th book but that is just reference material anyway.

-------------------------------
About the original books:
This series of books is unfortunately far from perfect, with typos, editorial mistakes as well as poor English, but they fill their purpose anyway. (The real disgrace is that they are probably the best course material for there is) "
,Kax2,2007-09-20T19:55Z,"Two pdf's are faulty, Flight Planning and Human Performance

Unfortunately, tomtom2k seems to have lost interest in this torrent so there is no fix for this. I will try to recover the files and if I make it I will post them on TPB. "
,apix,2007-09-25T23:10Z,"Thanks for these books, just completing the ATPL and this is a perfect ref. for on the road. ;-)

""These books were originally printed in 2001 but here we have the second edition from 2002.""

Not entirely true, books 6 and 8-12 in this torrent are 1st editions. It seems that 2nd editions of some of these books are available in eDonkey:

6 - Mass & Balance And Performance:

I already managed to download these four books, total 315.60MB. There were plenty of sources so they should not be impossible to get if anyone else wants them too.

However, it seems that the 2nd editions of books 8, 9, 10 and 14 are not available anywhere. Has anyone located them?"

I have the nordian ATPL theory e-book and want to upload it but I have never done these kinds of stuff so if anyone can help me I would be greatful.

I hate that everything costs when you want to get into flying and hence I want to upload the e-book so it gets some dollars cheaper :)
