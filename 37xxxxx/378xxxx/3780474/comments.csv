,KEOPI,2007-09-10T00:29Z,"Wait this is the game ff9 with files in flac format right, does those files work alright with game ?"
,Osaka,2007-09-10T04:54Z,"Huh?? What are you talking about?

This is the FF9 OST.

Did you even read the description...?"
,eahn,2007-10-30T18:59Z,"Hey, thanks for a great soundtrack! I've been looking for several Final Fantasy soundtracks in lossless format. You don't happen to have more?"
,Osaka,2007-11-07T03:53Z,"For Final Fantasy 1-6 in lossless... 

...you can go to OCRemix.org and search for ""Final Fantasy IV"" for example, 
then go to ""Chiptunes"" and you will be able to download the original songs.

From OCRemix: 

""Chiptunes, as well as sample-based formats like RSN/SPC for the SNES, 
allow you to replay the original soundtracks to many of your favorite games.""

Since it uses the same format as the songs use when they 
are stored on the original cartridges, it's pretty much lossless.

It's sort of pointless to have FF1 to FF6 in FLAC... the space is just not worth it.

I personally own the following FF soundtracks:

Final Fantasy VI Original Sound Version
Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale
Final Fantasy VII Original Sound Track
Final Fantasy VIII Original Soundtrack
Final Fantasy IX Original Soundtrack Plus
Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack
Final Fantasy S Generation

I only uploaded FFX in FLAC because it was a special request AND I traded it for something else...

The FF9 soundtrack I uploaded because it's terribly hard to find it, at all, so after I found it on eMule I 
thought it would be nice to make a torrent of it because no doubt other people are also looking for it.

I don't feel like uploading the other soundtracks because there's no point really.

I've got better things to use by bandwidth for.

And I made the FF6, FF6 GF, FF7, FF8, FF10 OSTs available as high bitrate MPC files...

Which SOUNDS like lossless 99% of the time, but it's much smaller.

And due to the simple nature of the music in FF6, compressing the audio doesn't destroy the quality.
At least not noticeably. In FF7, the audio was done in a more advanced and better way, but it's still 
pretty simple and not so complex. FF8 is much better but it still isn't terribly complex.

The FF10 audio is harder to compress... but the actual OST itself was very poorly mastered.

I mean, when they recorded it, they messed up on the sound quality. The audio is too loud.

The Advent Children OST is a another good example. It sounds horrible, quality-wise.

Sooo, yeah... If you absolutely must have some FF soundtrack in lossless, just try eMule.

You'll probably find it there, whatever it may be...

Try searching for example:

Final Fantasy APE
Final Fantasy FLAC
Final Fantasy Wavpack
Final Fantasy Lossless

...and make sure you search for ""Archives"" only.

Use your imagination..."
,dubconqueso,2007-11-08T07:20Z,"Thank You!!!! lol i wanted 1 song out of this whole soundtrack but hadn't been able to find it anywhere.  Amazing quality as well :P  ty very much, if not for this i would of had to drive miles to my friends house and search though his collection just to get the cd so i could get the song."
,t3hc411,2007-11-27T03:32Z,"As wonderful and awesome as lossless quality would be, I don't have room for 1.42 Gibs on anywhere, nor the means to convert it, as I have Linux. Would you mind uploading a high-end mp3 copy of the OST?"
,Osaka,2007-12-01T16:46Z,"@ t3hc411 ...

No, I won't. 

At least not MP3... maybe in MPC, but.. I don't think so.

You should be able to convert it by yourself pretty easy though.

Here's MPC for Linux: http://musepack.net/index.php?pg=lin

And FLAC is available for Linux too: http://flac.sourceforge.net/download.html

If you manage to decode the FLAC files to WAV (which shouldn't be hard), then you can then convert those to MPC.

Or MP3... or OGG, or AAC.

But I don't see why anyone would want to use those formats.

At high bitrates (128 and above), the quality rank goes pretty much like this - from best to worst:

1# Lossless

2# MPC
3# AAC
4# Ogg
5# MP3

AAC and Ogg Vorbis compresses much better than MPC at lower bitrates though (like 48, 64, 80, for example...)

But at such low bitrates it aint gonna sound so good anyway.

But AAC is perfect for movies... Goes very well with H.264 encoded video.

For music though, you'd normally want high bitrate VBR... in the 160-320 kbps range."
