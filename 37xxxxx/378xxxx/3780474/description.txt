After searching for the FF9 soundtrack for several years,
I finally found it in lossless on eMule, in APE format.

I decoded the .APE image back to .WAV, splitted it, and encoded to FLAC.

I don't know if it was ripped with Exact Audio Copy or not, it didn't say,
but the job seemed pretty professionally done, so EAC _was_ probably used.

There is no proof of that though.

But I've listened to it and it sounds perfect...

What is FLAC? What is Lossless?
-------------------------------

FLAC is a lossless codec.

There are several lossless codecs; FLAC, APE and Wavpack are three of them.

Lossless means an exact 1:1 copy of the original CD, with PERFECT quality.

MP3, for example, compresses the audio to make smaller files... 
but when that is done, the quality suffers a lot in the process.

FLAC does make the size smaller, but it does not destroy any audio data.

It's a lot like a .RAR archive, but much better.

How do I listen to it? What can I do with FLAC files?
-----------------------------------------------------

You can play FLAC in Winamp or Foobar2000.
It works in a lot of other players as well.

If you want to, you can decode the files back to .WAV.

To do this, simply download the FLAC Frontend: 
http://flac.sourceforge.net/download.html

Simply drag the FLACs into the program and press DECODE.

Then, if you want to, you can convert the .WAVs to a lossy format.
