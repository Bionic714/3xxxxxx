HIStory was the first album where Jackson showcased his instrumental abilities, playing keyboard and synthesizer, guitar, drums and percussion on the album, as well as lead and backing vocals. He was also more involved in the production of this album, collaborating with producers Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Dallas Austin, Bill Bottrell and R. Kelly.

Sony Music backed the album's promotion with a 30 million dollar promotion and marketing campaign, the largest budget set for an album at that time. The campaign included a full set of singles and music videos, television and radio advertising, an 82 concert world tour, and eventually a remix album. Reviews were mixed and Jackson was ridiculed in the press for his promotional campaign of erecting statues of himself around Europe and floating himself down the River Thames.

For the first time in his career, Jackson significantly utilizes coarse language on this album, the majority of which are still not allowed on network television in the United States. Michael also experimented with more genres on HIStory than on any other album, ranging from orchestral to adult contemporary rhythm and blues to "Gothic pop".
