,azuziel,2011-10-22T18:18Z,"@MMcCallum


Realize comment is 2 years old. But seeding does NOT clog up your connection. Downloading is just that, downloading, seeding uses your upload speed. Your connection will be rated up/down. You use the down, seeding uses up. The two are seperate, so seeding, or seeding without capping will NOT effect yoru download speed in any way, shape, form, or fashion. There is no reason, to NOT seed. Other then not wanting to distribute copyrighted material."
,1g2t3x,2011-10-30T09:29Z,"awesome!

,IamHangman,2012-01-15T18:55Z,Could someone that has 100% please seed their is at least 7 people at 99.1%?
,Gerellirra,2012-04-07T14:34Z,"If you are torrenting, please make sure you seed at LEAST until you reach a 1.0 ratio, failing to do so makes the system fail and the networking of all of this beautiful work people have taken the time to put up here for us wither. I will seed everything I torrent until 1.5 ratio. - Thank you Worelon"
