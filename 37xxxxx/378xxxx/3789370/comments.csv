Crack Install Instructions:

1) Put ""paul.dll"" & ""Boishock.exe"" in your install folder (backup the originals incase)

2) Run secu.eg.reg (importing it into the registry)

3) Play Bioshock

4) Visit stansdad.com for free South Park episodes!


Another crack that you can try. I still don't have the game to try it, but sooner or later there will be a working crack. Until then try this, hopefully it works!

	I swear i have seen lots of people say it is working on Vista but not so many on xp and there is no way i change to that piece of crap vista just to play this.

	I just need to get one last thing clarified from people who have successfully installed & ran the game.When it's mentioned to copy the crack files into the respective Bioshock release directory should we replace it over the existing files like "
,fatboy187,2007-09-01T17:24Z,This Works...Very easy to install if you just read and follow directions...Everything works including saves..100% CRACKED...Now what ! :P
