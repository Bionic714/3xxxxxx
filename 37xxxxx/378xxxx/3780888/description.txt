Plot: From Brian Yuzna, producer of Re-Animator and From Beyond comes this rather disturbing 1980s look at the horrors of the upper class.Bill is worried that he is 'different' to his sister and parents. They mix with other 'upper class' people while Bill is more down to earth. Even his girlfriend seems a bit odd. All is revealed when Bill returns home to find a party in full swing. Not for the weak of stomach. An interesting and overlooked horror entry with horrifying and memorable makeup effects
