,trakko_man,2007-09-26T20:06Z,U need another PSP but not custom firmaware on it
,jook11,2007-10-01T22:53Z,"That's a negative, trakko_man. This does require a working PSP with either a custom firmware, or original version 1.5 to set it up. It also has some steps to be done on the PC."
,MediaManiac,2007-10-10T08:14Z,"Some unsung geniuses has come up with a work around. It now does not require a working psp. Just one battery, ""the files"" however it involves sodering which isnt for everyone, as well a memory stick reader(in which you can copy files to it). I can guarentee its 100% working!!!!

I was back up in no time and stoked playing my games and watching my tv shows and my dvds again this is some sweet reverse engineering!

,deanocunniffe,2008-04-02T20:15Z,"sweet-leaf update ur firmware to any that is higher than 3.80 then do the network update on the psp itself this will automatically give u the newest software all games will work if ever u have trouble again just do the network update again 

dark alex rules i love the fact that he has made it possible to do a normal network update as if its not hacked and it will install the latest cfw"
