,Laustis,2009-12-14T18:58Z,"Now i am wondering, WHAT THE HELL is a M3U-file?? There is one of those in this torrent, and it is very nice, and very very bugged at the same time.. it is the entire album in a 298 kb format.. But with no matters of stopping it playing the album , aftering starting it.. It simple Doesn't have a player, so you have to shut down the com to stop it."

M3U is a computer file format that stores multimedia playlists. It was originally implemented in Winamp, although it is now supported by many applications.

An M3U file is a plain text file that contains the locations of one or more media files that the media player should play. Each location is placed on a new line. The locations can be either absolute or relative local pathnames (e.g., ""C:\My Music\Heavysets.mp3"" or ""Heavysets.mp3"") or they can be URLs. The file can also include comments, prefaced by the ""#"" character. In extended M3U, ""#"" also introduces extended M3U directives.

One common use of the M3U file format is creating a playlist file that contains a single entry pointing to a stream on the Internet. The created file provides easy access to that stream and can be used for things like downloading from a website or for emailing, or for Internet radio listening.

The file is saved with the ""M3U"" or ""m3u"" filename extension, and - if edited in a text editor - must be encoded in the ANSI (Windows-1252) format in order to be understood by media players.

""m3u"" files properly use the Latin-1 charset. The unicode version of ""m3u"" is ""m3u8"", which uses UTF-8 unicode characters."
