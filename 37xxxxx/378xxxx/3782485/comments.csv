,distantknight,2009-07-27T10:42Z,"   My many thanks to u griffie for having such an old classic still available for us.  Once I have this D/L-ed I will keep it up for a week or so as a seed.

   I am curious as to what "" S T F U "" might mean?,
and am I correct in thinking it is not such a nice thing ?"

This is truly a magnificent share! Cant thank you enough Griffie !!"
