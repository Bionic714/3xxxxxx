,vnmp1984,2008-03-18T04:34Z,When I downloaded the game it also said insert cd.  Then I burned it with Power ISO and it worked fine.
,Dontdothisathome,2008-09-15T19:19Z,Try burn it with Nero?
,ElPirataVE,2008-11-30T23:51Z,"I downloaded the iso file, burned it to a CD-R CD using Nero and it worked fine!. It DOES however require the CD to be into the drive in order to play. Good game, my daughter loved it. Thx for sharing. 
As usual, if you like the downloaded material, support the vendor by buying from them! I do!"
