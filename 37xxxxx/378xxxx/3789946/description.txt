This is one of the best hardcore 7 inches ever to come out from Sweden. Feuturing Jonsson from Anti cimex on bass. This was only released in 500 copies in 1982 so it is kind of a rare record. Saw this going on ebay for about $200 a while ago. I have recorded it with a technics player through an old H/K amp so I think its ok sound. This aint no pretentious shit hardcore. Simple, raw and they way it was meant to be. Just listen to the solo of Warsystem!
