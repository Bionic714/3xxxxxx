Planet Parent Special:  Aspergers Syndrome

Every school has a few: the kids on the fringes. They have obsessive interests and play alone. These kids just don't fit it, and it's painful for them and their families who often aren't sure how to help.


We are now learning that this kind of behavior could be a sign of Asperger 
syndrome. Asperger is a high-functioning kind of autism that results in kids who are sometimes called "little professors." It's tough to diagnose and wasn't even identified until the mid 1990s. Thousands of adults may have grown up with Asperger without knowing it.


This special program demystifies Asperger and examines its impact on several families. The program also offers a platform of researchers and other experts to discuss the origin of this mysterious disorder and the hunt for a cure.
