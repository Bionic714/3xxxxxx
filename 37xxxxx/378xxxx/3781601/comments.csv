I'll never buy a Creative product again though I love my Vision W. Fact that they dont just share this at their site and fact that they NEVER improve the firmware ticks me off. Its like the Vision W is a failed product to them... Never- fucking -mind the people who actually bought the machine."

Is there any chance you could seed this torrent again?
I need the install cd and this seems the only place i can get it!

Thanks in advance!!"
