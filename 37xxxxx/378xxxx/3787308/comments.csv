,Dairetsu,2008-11-17T23:07Z,Could someone seed this?
,Eaten_d,2008-11-25T20:39Z,"Thank you.. At last I found this. Very nice..

How many seasons exist of this anime?"
,garadark,2009-10-12T05:07Z,"Two Seasons of this anime exist along with a ""3rd season"" that is an incomplete OVA.
The first season is called:
""Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni"" and is referred to as the ""Question Arcs"".
The Second Season is called:
""Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni Kai"" and is referred to as the ""Answer Arcs"".
The Third Season is called:
""Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni Rei"" and is not referred to by any special title.
The Third Season, as stated before, is an OVA. Original Video Art and has no official connection to the previous two Seasons. However, OVA's are some times made by the creators and thus act as an unofficial ""follow up"" on the series.
i do not know if that is the case here.
i hope this information was helpful."

""Higurashi no naku koro ni rei"" is also called the Conclusion arc, pls be complete..."
,Vexizan,2010-05-16T10:45Z,Is this the censored version?
,rippinblaise,2010-06-22T00:08Z,"@Vexizan
Watching it, they don't show a whole lot, so I believe so
but i could be wrong, i've never seen any other version to compare to
does anyone have an official answer?"
,rippinblaise,2010-06-22T02:54Z,"@Vexizan
I have confirmed that this is the censored version"
,em0rox,2010-06-30T12:03Z,"far as I can tell it's the censored version, I watched the entire season from this torrent. I have not seen the ""uncensored"" or know if it even exists but according to any video I can find online of ""uncensored clips"" they are the same that happen in this torrent."
,Sleppmegin,2011-01-17T18:52Z,"Sucks if its censored, then I'm uninterested, also this is mislabeled as a movie ..."
,Sleppmegin,2011-01-17T19:01Z,"Then skrew this, no way i want a censored version of anything X]"
,Pwnzorz,2011-01-21T02:58Z,"Woah. Nice speeds. After I'm done, I'll be seeding good stuff like this forever."
,blazewave222,2011-05-01T06:30Z,"This anime makes no sense. sorry to say but just watching chapter 1 and 2 makes the anime so confusing.  How the fuck does someone die and then pop up randomly in the next chapter, but with a different kill scene? Ill keep on watching this anime, but right now in my opinion this is one of the most fucked up anime shows ive ever watched. If you guys wanna watch an awesome blood romance kinda thing, then go watch elfen lied. P.S. ill seed"
,Jackass Jimm,2011-06-04T05:25Z,"darn.  Didn't know that there was a first season.  should have researched more.  I just finished watching season 2.  :/  

I thought it looked cool and all the fighting and alternate worlds...but I always kept thinking that ""it'd be cool if they actually devoted time to those flashbacks"".  Turns out that they DID...in season 1.  

I'll download this one and try to watch it, but having watched season 2, I don't know how entertaining season 1 will be, considering that I know what all of the mysteries are."
,BuzzGamer,2011-07-31T10:30Z,HELL YEAH LET'S HAVE THE CHILL OF HORROR IN THE BLOOD VEIN!!!!!!!!
,Earl96,2012-05-31T06:40Z,"Censored? From what I've seen of this, it wouldn't be much of a show censored. But this is the only torrent with any seeds so I guess I'll check it out."
