,ascheundstoub,2008-04-07T08:02Z,"feel free to call me a n00b... but how the hell do i install this? i've got power iso but this isn't in an .iso form... someone please lend me a hand
ascheundstoub@yahoo.com"
,CarnageHeart,2008-04-08T10:54Z,"Ok... gonna try to cover everyone's fuck ups here.

1. In regards to wamber's .BC! file extension problem... that's because you're using either BitComet or BitLord (Which BTW you shouldn't use BitLord for the simple fact that they're just stealing BitComet's work). And that the file IS NOT FINSHED DOWNLOADING YET! So of course the damned thing won't work!

2. In regard to Drive Emulators. DaemonTools is all you really need to mount the majority of Disc Images available, but if you prefer PowerISO thats fine (for the love of God and all that is Holy just don't use DiscJuggler)

3. Serial number issues make sure you don't get youre 1's i's L's o's 0's B's and 8's confused. If it still doesn't work search for a Keygen or something.

4. Which is really specifically for ascheundstoub - just cause it's not a .ISO file, doesn't mean it won't work with PowerISO.

5. If you're having install issues from the autoload screen (screen that pops up when disc is ""inserted"") do this.

Open ""My Computer"", right click on the disc drive and select ""Open"", you'll see all the files on the disk. Now find the Setup/Install.exe (thats not the name of it, my download is currently going so I don't know the file name yet but it shouldn't be that hard to find) that starts the actual installation.

Aaaaand I think that about covers it for now... I'm sure there will be more bad questions/stupidity... just gotta wait for it."
,ascheundstoub,2008-04-09T01:36Z,"my issue is that there is no .iso or .bin, just a folder with what looks like an explored view of a disc, not a damned thing which power iso recognizes as mountable...

while i appreciate the help that you've offered to everyone here, consider for a quick second that most of these people, including myself, are running into a problem they've never dealt with before, and have to ASK in order to LEARN how to fix it, and that you yourself once must've gone through the exact same process."
,ascheundstoub,2008-04-09T01:38Z,"to elaborate a bit more, if i even OPEN the folder created by this torrent, my computer restarts immediately, the only way i can even get through the folders inside is browsing through power iso.

again... not trying to be an unappreciative ass, i've simply never used power iso before."
,sgtstandby,2008-04-12T21:49Z,"ok 
i have the game down loaded
and i have it installed the Serial
worked
and when i go to play it 
wrong disk is inserted...
any help?"
,corruptcompassion,2008-04-25T17:44Z,"a similar problem popped up with Balder's Gate 2. For that one, I had to completely unmount a disk before I mounted another one in order to play/install. I hope this works."
,brondwin,2008-05-09T14:28Z,ummm ive managed to download and install the game but when it loads up the game just keeps loading the expansions and the game stops responding any help please??????
,lifeonholidae,2008-06-15T05:08Z,"Hello all.  I have been attempting to successfully install and play this game for the past 2 days, after having spent 3 days dling.  To briefly elaborate on my particular situation: 

I mounted it with Daemon Tools. 
Installed it using the key provide by the image.
Proceed to click on the exe file within the image and always get ""insert DVD.""  

I probably sound like an incompetent ass but I need your help!  You're my only hope.  Its that or I actually pay for it.  "
,loxxikus,2008-07-08T12:36Z,Can someone please help with the problem the last guy stated?  I've installed the game.  Then I start the game and click play.  Before it loads I get a pop-up saying to insert the correct DVD-ROM.  Help?
,RedMage8BT,2008-07-11T00:10Z,"Okay, I downloaded it, and all I have is a DAA file along with the EXE files (cracks and original files). I tried mounting it with Daemon Tools. Windows won't recognize it. I tried opening it with PowerIso. PowerIso doesn't recognize any files in it. I even tried extracting it with Winrar, but Winrar doesn't recognize it either.

Can anyone help?"

,miyeko,2008-09-10T06:33Z,"Also, CarnageHeart, it doesnt seem like you actually helped anyone.  Alot of people still cant play the game.  Some of the same people you were a jerk too."

,punkrain,2010-02-08T04:35Z,"HI ppl,
My installation and download went completely smoothly, I just mounted them into DAEMON tools and burned them onto discs from there.
However, when I go to play the game, it gives me an error saying that it ""Cannot Find the CD-ROM"" and to ""Eject the disk, then click Okay and restart Application""

... any tips??????????
Need halp, nao. xD"
,Mr.PENUT,2010-06-28T19:38Z,"Daemon doesn't require any reboot. I USED to use it, but I think VirtualCloneDrive is better.
You can right click a drive then select mount. Load file and TaDa!
I can't wait for this since meh siblings killed my original sims. :p"
,Mr.PENUT,2010-06-28T19:40Z,"Sorry for double comment but oh yeah Wex28.
Like there is going to be a screen that wants a serial of all the Sims games ever made lol."
,Mr.PENUT,2010-06-28T19:42Z,"Really? A triple post?
I forgot to mention VirtualCloneDrive and Daemon can open more than you think. They said VCD couldn't mount .MDFs but I manually selected it and it worked. Try doing that with diffrent mounting files. Just a tip."
