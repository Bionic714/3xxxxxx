,MrFingers,2007-08-31T05:06Z,"those of you having problems, I found the following worked for me;

1) burn a CD of the warchief image you've downloaded here

2) reinstall AOE3, version 1.0, NOT cracked

Everything seems to have functioned as expected from that point onwards."

,ferjam,2007-09-03T14:24Z,"guys i still can't get it to run at all, i have finally managed to install it but it just asks for the original game CD constantly- is there a crack to have no CD or should you burn the original game onto a disc?"
,MrFingers,2007-09-03T19:12Z,"ferjam, I detailed for you how to get it working only 3 comments before yours.  Please learn to read."
,shimapel,2007-09-03T21:00Z,"I tried the steps you posted.

I just downloaded AOE 3 from here and installed it.

then i just installed the warchiefs expansion.

i put the burnt warchiefs dvd in my cd drive, but after that it still tells me to put the original disk in."
,MrFingers,2007-09-04T00:06Z,"ok, warchiefs expansion is a CD, not a DVD.  was that a typo or was that the problem?"
,shimapel,2007-09-04T01:39Z,"oh the expansion is a cd?!

i burnt it on a dvd, lemme try to burn it on a cd."
,bennycutts,2007-09-10T02:08Z,"Well, I've done everything to the t.
Toasted a CD (not a DVD) of WarChiefs, reinstalled Age 3 1.0, installed warchiefs, left the CD in the drive and tried opening warchiefs and it still asks for the original CD. Is there some minor point I have missed. At the end of the WarChiefs installation there is an installer script that runs that makes me a little suspicious... it runs for over a minute. Is it looking for something? I've read through all of the comments to no avail. We need a nocd crack for this. Anyone write one yet?"
,bennycutts,2007-09-10T02:40Z,"one more thing... the application asks for ""age 3 - The WarChiefs""  and not the burned CD ""Age of Empires III - The WarChiefs"" which is what comes in the torrent.... this seems to be part of the problem.... any ideas?"
,Edzard,2007-09-12T22:43Z,"When I tried burning it, it gave an error. Also when trying to open it with Diskimagemounter it says ""this item appears to be damaged, do you want to open it anyway?"""
,serious-hod,2007-09-25T15:50Z,where i can download ty update Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties for macosx?
,DragonWizard,2007-09-26T09:35Z,OK guys.. I tried 10 times and made 10 coasters till I tried it as Image File in toast and NOT as a DATA FILE but instead use COPY and Image File.. I thought Oh Boy another coaster but NOPE it worked this time and started right up.. AND YES you must have Age of Empires 3 version 1+ already ON your Hard Drive...
,3uropa,2007-09-27T16:41Z,can we locate the origin of the problem here. first about the last comment: if you choose open with after a right click on the downloaded file it will open anyway (if you have toast) in the image file section. but it doesn't make it work. my version of age of empires is 1.02 version not   cracked. so (irony!) i've decided to follow the advice of mr fingers and uploading the torrent version of age of empires 3. i will not crack it and tell you in my next post if it works for me.
,DragonWizard,2007-09-28T02:00Z,"Hey I Got mine to work.. so I really don't need a lesson on how it works.. I thought maybe someone else could use the info..What you actually have a problem with is not so evident to me.. Are you saying I shouldn't have done it the way I did??  Well, guy, at least IT WORKED...Why you are trying to tell people it doesn't work is beyond me.. Well, you just do what you think you should but DON'T try to say that doesn't work cause that is BULL.. get a clue guy.. and to everyone else.. try it for yourself and SEE if it works.. don't just try to be a B*TT and say it doesn't when I know it does.. thank you for your time  JEEZ!!"
,DragonWizard,2007-09-28T02:08Z,"By the way, what I said to do is exactly the same thing MrFingers said except I was just more clear about making sure you used the right Toast setting.. That is all.. He and I are BOTH right as we are saying the exact same thing.. But if you really need a MrFinger then I guess I got one of those for you as well.."
,3uropa,2007-09-28T20:14Z,"butt, finger, nothing more? i didn't insult you. i was trying to say that many people claimed that the file isn't working but without saying if they burnt the cd with toast or/and with version of AE3 (cracked, 1.0 not cracked, 1.02 not cracked) that's all. 

so then i installed 1.0 not cracked, intsalled warchief from the disc image and burnt it via toast (image/copy) and it stille claimed for the original cd. 

so i'm in the myst. nothing so far has worked for me.

and dragonwizard, you should consult for your mental problem. it's quite easy to insult people on internet. what about face to face. i live in iceland. airplanes tickets are cheap. i would be glad to see if you speak the same language in front of me."
,iraqijew,2007-10-07T23:17Z,"Well anyway, burning as an image file in Toast worked for me. The only problem now is, it freezes at the loading screen. :-("
,stan65,2007-10-12T11:42Z,I have the same problem. It freezes. 
,stan65,2007-10-13T04:16Z,"I found how to fix the problem.
I'm using Japanese as the priority language. 
You need to change your language to English from the ""International"" in the system preferences to make it work.
If irawjew is using another language, try changing to English. "
,dapork,2007-11-04T20:35Z,"Hey so what's the way to actually get this to work? I've had the image on my computer, burnt it twice to CDs but it keeps asking for the original CD. I've also tried naming my hard drive Age 3 - The Warchiefs but then it just says the game cannot be played from my drive and it asks for me to drag it onto my hard disk again..."

,decked,2008-01-04T17:30Z,"Okay well this torrent is shit for me, i burned it onto a disk with toast as an image file, then i inserted it, tryed to install.. and it asked for the original disk. What's up with this? "
,israelvalenciac,2008-01-05T21:06Z,"Hi! I'm on Leopard and it did worked for me
first of all you must follow these instructions(thank you to Jpjones for posting this on the civ 4 torrent)

To get the cracks/patches working on leopard (same procedure on both patches):

Copy the patch from the .dmg to your harddrive so they can be modified

Download the latest iPatch (3.7.1) from ipatch.org

Rightclick on patch, choose ""Show package contents"", locate the file ""Contents/MacOS/iPatcher"" (208 K)

Mount iPatch dmg, rightclick iPatch app, choose ""Show package contents""

Locate ""Contents/Resources/iPatcher"" (448 K), rightclick it and choose ""Show package contents""

Locate ""Contents/MacOS/iPatcher"" (212 K)

Replace the file ""iPatcher"" (208 K) in the patch with ""iPatcher"" (212 K).

then you just need to open it the crack with rosetta"
,chimpy72,2008-02-22T13:12Z,"Right. This is for a the n00bs that can't figure it out.

*Lock* the bloody image (Get Info --> tick 'Lock') before you do anything else. Don't mount it before you lock it!

After locking it, control/right click the image and go down to 'More', then click 'Mount It' (you must have installed Toast for this, and made sure it has installed contextual menus).

Finally, install your Warchiefs! You must have the original AoE3 (i.e. not cracked). Select it, and click Install.

After it has reached 100% it will say 'Running Installer Script'. This will take some time. Don't quit the installer!

Finally, mount (with More --> Mount It) your *LOCKED* ""Age 3 - The WarChiefs.toast""

Double click the Warchiefs game (your original AoE 3 game will have been updated automatically and obligatorily to version 1.0.2 and will require cracking again).

Ta Da!

Ta Da!"
,chimpy72,2008-02-22T13:14Z,"BTW:

""Age 3 - The WarChiefs.toast"" is the name of my disk image crack.

Yours may differ. However, it still must be locked before mounting with More --> Mount It."

,stomper09,2008-10-19T05:02Z,"here is the trick folks...
1. Open ""Age 3 - The WarChiefs.toast"" and mount it with Toast. 
2. Follow the instructions and install it. DONÂ´T PLAY THE GAME YET.
3. after the install ends, In Toast, click on the option ""copy disc""
3. Save as a disc image (here is the trick) When the dialog box appear to the location for save the file, click on ""compress"" and then ""ok""
4. This make the file convert from .toast to .dmg
5. Unmount ""Age 3 - The WarChiefs.toast"" and mount the new file you save ""Age 3 - The WarChiefs.dmg""
6.Now you can play the game. Always you want to play the game, mount the .dmg file.
Enjoy bros.

,C2H6O,2008-10-26T02:19Z,"The only problem with that method is that most people's errors are with the actual installation part. It gives an error of ""bad media"""

sucks pretty much. maybe youve done somethin while uploading the torrent........
can u upload it again??
would be great..."
,nosretep3,2008-12-09T00:27Z,"This torrent appears to have become corrupt. The media error that some of us are getting happens whether mounted in toast, mounted as a dmg, burned on cd, and even when the installer is copied to disk. 

Can someone that has a working copy please start a new torrent. I'm willing to seed for an extended period of time.

Preferably a .dmg this time. Not sure the reasoning behind it being a toast file. The other expansion and the original game install fine from dmgs. And this way no one will need toast to get this running.

Thanks"
,Enemy04,2009-05-27T03:38Z,"If you get an error while installing download the torrent again, it's corrupted... :( 
Then follow these instructions: 

1. Lock the image, don?t touch it while you download or even mount it when done. Copy the image -just incase you make a mistake-

2. Mount it with Toast, right clicking and putting  "" More"" and ""Mount it"" You will see a CD in finder 

3. Install the Warchiefs game locating the original ""Age of Empires III.app"" 
***Age of Empires 3 can't be cracked,so install the game again if you cracked it, you can always mount the dmg, but if you downloaded the game with "".toast"" at the end you gotta...

-Mount the "".toast"" image of Age of Empires 3, if you downloaded it that way and drag the CD to Toast and then go to file, ""save as disc image"", check ""compressed"" save it, and then unmount the "".toast"" image and mount "".dmg"" image of AOE 3 and then you can open the game without a crack!!! :)
-If you downloaded Age of Empires 3 with a dmg, then you just mount the dmg and you can open it, now worries. 

4. When done installing Warchiefs, drag the CD on the desktop to Toast in the copy section. Go to file and to ""Save as disc image"" and while you save CHECK ""compressed"" just like the other one. 

5. When it?s done unmount the CD and mount the dmg you just saved of Warchiefs

6. OPEN warchiefs and PLAY....SEED GUYS!!! and ENJOY!!!! 

REMEMBER YOU MUST ALWAYS MOUNT THE DMMGS TO PLAY!!!!!!"
,Enemy04,2009-05-27T04:55Z,"So on INSTRUCTION 3 if you cracked you Age of Empires III convert the "".toast"" to "".dmg"". If you can open the game without a crack simply skip that tiny part and go to STEP 4. "

This wouldn't be an issue, except I can't find Age of Empires III on my hard drive. I'm running 10.4.11, is this why I can't locate it, or am I just too big of a nublet?"
,AOE3BESTEVER,2009-12-16T04:35Z,"
** ATTENTION ** ! ! !

NO MORE CRACK NEEDED !!!!

Step 1: Install AOE3 and/or Expansions

Step 2: Update AOE3 to the latest patch (1.05) and then update the expansions to the latest patch. heres a link to all the patches
http://destineergames.com/support/?page_id=88

Its that easy!

Now Age of Empire 3 should even work online, no crack needed because the latest updates remove the cd check, just download Gameranger create a free account and your good to go.

Hope this helps. If you still cant get Age of Empires III to work then its because you failed to follow my simple steps.

See you on the battlefield! xD"

,sonofwill,2010-05-20T13:02Z,"Mount with Toast? You DO realize that Toast is software that costs $80.00... right?

Thanks for nothing. If you had the ability to upload the .dmg, and didn't, then this is just a slap in the face, and a waste of everyone's time who doesn't have it."
,sonofwill,2010-05-21T00:17Z,"okay, got a version of Toast, and the Warchiefs installer gets almost completely finished, then encounters an error and shuts down.

Apparently some people here have gotten this to work? PLEASE EXPLAIN how, if the installer is corrupted, you managed to install it? Am I really to believe that 90% of the people here simply downloaded it wrong? Impossible."
,paulomatiz1,2010-07-08T04:06Z,"Help!!!!! im so confused on what to do.. ok so i download the torrent and pass it through transmission ( same as utorrent or vuze ) then what do i do, ive read comments and i dont want to fall into a problem ill regret later please HELP!"

,pushpop84,2010-12-20T17:55Z,@Enemy04: So what should I do if I cracked the Age of Empires 3 because I downloaded it seperately earlier? 
,mehmet93pirate_bay,2011-01-26T22:51Z,so how the fuck are we gonna install it 
,mandorst5,2011-07-28T23:52Z,"if someone still cares:
this is how I got it to work:
1) download torrent (duh)
2) open with toast
3) mount it
4) drag installer file to desktop
5) install it
6) if it freezes near the end, it will still work, close it with cmd-alt-esc
7) download patches on http://destineergames.com/support/?page_id=88
(newest versions for age of empires & for warchiefs)
8) play (and seed) "
