,sgthawk,2007-09-26T04:57Z,"While not the most current it still an all in one package and software like hand break are free to be downloaded at the official website....don't knock it if you don't need it, just keep moving"
,Nycteris,2008-01-20T17:08Z,would be useful if you could tell us what these apps actually do. (please)
,ContentRatedX,2008-03-19T03:03Z,"Here is some of them do. I own most of these:
 DVD2OneX&MacTheRipper - Rip DVD's onto Computer,
 DVDRemaster - Helps you with Converting/Reformatting DVD's
 Handbrake - Ripping DVD's/Videos into iPod/Mp3 Compat. Files.
 iSerial Reader&KCNScrew - Program containing various serials/patches
 Roxio Popcorn - Movie Burning tools
 Toast Titanium - DVD/CD Burning/Ripping Application. Runs great on Leopard.
 VLX - Multi-Media Player, requiring next-to-no plugins, can play .avi, .flv, .wmv, and various other Media files, kind of like a more powerful Quicktime with a less ""glam"" interface.

NOTE: I only gave the functions of the programs which I know/use/own. I am not too familiar with the others."
