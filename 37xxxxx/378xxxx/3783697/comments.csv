[T],kef71,2007-08-26T10:59Z,"Thank you, whoever you are, for helping me seed this torrent!"
,i.r.pierat,2007-08-29T17:12Z,"Thanks for the upload!  I have yet to find a ripped release that I am satisfied with, so I am going to try converting these into similar-quality MP4-format episodes myself.  If all goes well, I will follow suit when you upload Season 2. :)"
,alenkr,2007-08-29T18:20Z,"Thanks!!! my upload is only 84 kb/s but when I download 100% I'll stay and upload for a few days.

,raggaman-pirat,2007-09-05T01:19Z,"Hello kef71 and everybody !!

Thank you kef71 for upload, i like Star Trek !!

And thank you for all seeders !!!"
,jnd,2007-09-11T02:27Z,"Agreed with i.r.pierat, some ""modern"" encoding of these in h.264 or Xvid rather than the DivX 3 rips encoded in something like 2002 that I've seen would be wonderful. ;)

As for these, well it doesn't get any better than this! Thanks, and I hope to see forthcoming seasons!"
,i.r.pierat,2007-09-11T04:42Z,"I'm on it, but it's taking quite a while to download these DVDs... My share ratio is already at 1:1, and I'm not even in seeding mode yet.  Will post all of ST:TNG - Season 1 in MP4[H.264/AAC] format when it's done."
,raggaman-pirat,2007-09-15T13:36Z,"Thanks for all seeders to stay seed ! Thanks ! 
;-)"
,i.r.pierat,2007-09-21T12:13Z,"@kef71

Do all of the seasons have black bars and artifacts at the sides, or just some of them?

I assume this is due to the fact that not long ago CRT based TVs typically didn't display the outer edges of the video feed, and so when production companies would edit video destined for television distribution they would often just ignore any artifacts at the outer edges.  I know video editors changed their habits years ago, so I'm just curious if it was before or after the end of this series.

Anyways, I'm trying to work out my cropping and resizing numbers, before I begin re-encoding these, so that I can maintain consistency across all of the seasons.

Thanks again!"
,2RAGNAR,2007-09-23T08:38Z,"you have GREAT uploads! (planet earth, etc.) thank you  VERY much!!

,banisters,2007-10-04T16:37Z,"Awesome! Ive now completed the download of this 50gb biatch,it took me 20days with my cpu running 24/7.
When are you about to upload the other seasons? Do you have any approx. schedule for that?
Thnx again kef71,and looking forward to them other seasons. Keep up your excellent work!"
[T],kef71,2007-11-02T13:02Z,"everyone: I'll upload season 2 & 3 very soon. I'm busy seeding STV at the moment but I expect to start seeding TNG within a week or so.

kabster: Yes, all the next seasons will be multisubs, dutch included."

,berthiau,2008-08-27T05:55Z,"please seed, seed!

ty"
,Hiacepoika,2009-01-24T13:51Z,"Great job!

But I have to ask: Why there is not Finnish subs? Are they not included original DVD or are they left out on purpose? Even Norwegian subs are included, I'm not jealous but still..."
,Kamui_84,2009-09-22T20:26Z,"Big thanks to kef71!
I currently leech all TNG seasons and seed them with several MiB/s.
Once I have them all completed I plan to create one BIG torrent with all of them (about 400 GB).
The HDDs are big enough these days.

Thanks again."
,mrFriske,2009-10-01T05:23Z,how the fuck is it 50 bigabytes?!
,Kamui_84,2009-10-23T21:37Z,"I've created one BIG torrent of all seven seasons.
