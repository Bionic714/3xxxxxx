,picky_micke,2007-09-09T19:53Z,"rayjay! glad you liked it! apparently there were quite a few songs in the film that were left out on the soundtrack. trying to track those down and will upload them once they're complete.

meanwhile, you seem like a collector of disco music. you wouldn't know where to find Gary Byrd and the GB Experience - The Crown?
