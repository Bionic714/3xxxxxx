,xdeathwishx,2009-01-15T10:24Z,"This is bugged.  I have tried Stata/MP 64 bit and Stata/SE 32 bit.  Upon saving one of my datasets it deletes one of the variables at random.  I have run the same program in legit copies of this with no error.

Don't DL this one.  It installs fine but it will mess up your analysis."

Nikolaus Rentrop  is concerned
that Stata may be dropping variables unexpectedly:

Nikolaus should contact Stata Technical Services at
tech-support@stata.com and include as much information about his
installation as possible (including the output of the -about- command)
so that they can help him resolve it.  We have not seen such a problem
in an official Stata installation.  The only time we have ever seen a
problem like this has been with certain corrupt or modified
executables or licenses which are sometimes available from unofficial
sources on the internet.  A good first step at resolving the issue
would be to make sure to uninstall whatever has been installed and
then to perform a fresh install from an official Stata CD and license
to make sure everything is in a clean initial state.

,ccvd,2009-04-12T05:35Z,"Disappearing variables problem will occur if you install as SE or MP. You need to in fact install as IC. If you register the IC version using the keygen then you will not lose your variables. So here's how to fix:

1. Uninstall Stata 10.0 SE or MP
2. Delete folder from Program Files
3. Reinstall, making sure to choose IC
4. Extra step for Vista users: Go to the program folder, right click on the executable, go to the Compatibility tab and check ""Run as Administrator""
5. Start the program. Register using the keygen. If your antivirus program deleted the keygen or blocked you from using it, then use the following info to register:

SN: 198086420
Code: t3898771sbwfwdq384s6mw6irybg
Auth: 21sa

6. Enjoy!

Now I know you'll all start complaining that you want SE or MP. But remember, IC gives you a maximum of 2047 variables, 798 right hand side variables, unlimited observations, and a max matrix size of 800. For the majority of you this will be more than enough. The only downside is that you won't get the multi processor support. Not good enough for you? Go buy it."
,morglum82,2009-05-07T21:02Z,still drops variables for me
,pepe3535,2009-08-10T10:58Z,"this version of stata is OK (like official). But unofficial serials don't work anyway -as Alan  says there are no problems with official serial-.
Morever, stata will mess up your data analysis , drop variables (one by one), and results change everytime you do the job."
,JPeterson,2009-11-17T03:45Z,Anyone have Stata 11?
,JPeterson,2009-12-09T08:13Z,The anti-piracy random-dropped-variables problem seems to have been implemented in a version after this version. When I use the original wmpstata.exe modified June 12 2007 I don't get the problem. If you need the updated ado files try to run only 'update ado' instead of 'update all' which also updates the exe.
,SD2,2010-05-21T13:59Z,"
Is there a torrent online for the latest version of Stata (11)? I'm unable to find it anywhere on the internet (although its been shipping for a while now, spoiled I know :P)."
,SloveniaX,2010-06-20T22:41Z,Stata 11 now shipping on TPB too! :)
