Tail of the Sun (Japan: ?????? / Taiyou no Shippo: Wild, Pure, Simple Life) is a 3D hunting/gathering simulation game in which your ultimate objective is to build a tower of mammoth tusks that reaches the sun. To this end, you must gather enough food for your tribe to thrive and multiply, while exploring a large map full of various creatures and oddities. When you begin, the game drops you off at your home village with no goals, objectives, or guidance. You are free, from the outset, to go nearly anywhere and do basically what you like. While not a new concept in gaming, it was nevertheless, at the time of the game's release, a fairly radical one. The landscape your character inhabits is not only shared by a variety of polygonal fauna, but by flora rendered in the form of Mochi of various shapes and colors, which have varying effects on your health. While exploring the fairly vast landscape, your character will need to sleep, and will often choose to do so while in the middle of hunting or swimming. Upon its release, the game drew critical comparison to Artdink's earlier 'non-game' Aquanaut's Holiday. While Tail of the Sun did not ever see widepsread commercial success in either the US or Japan, it remains a unique exploration of what a videogame can be.
