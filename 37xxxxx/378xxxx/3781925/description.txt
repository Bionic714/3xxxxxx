FS2004 VFR Photographic Scenery Vol4 North

Inspired by the herioc failure of flightcrazy here is Vol 4 Oop Nerth..
(Coz I'm good to you all)

Yes I know it's out of sequence with my other upload but this ones rare, I don't think it's produced anymore so I expect it'll be in demand.

Same lark as my Vol1

rar with 3 discs of ISO's built using alcohol 120%

It's actually the FS2002 version but is the same as FS2004 I believe.
You MAY need need to run the FS2002_is_here.exe to install to FS2004 versions, this is in a folder on the 3rd disc with other useful utilities ;)


Bin Tested, burn to cd with Nero & go or just mount using Daemon Tools 

Please can early adopters  give feedback!

And Purleese seed, I have about 45K up max...

Plse note seeding may be a bit sporadic first days, be patient!

Apply the FSGlobal terrain mesh with this one and enjoy glorious sunrises over the Lake District...
