,gizmo24,2008-12-02T21:14Z,"Hey there ... thanks very much ratty but im having some trouble with installation :(

Ive downloaded applications before succesfuly so i hav e a rough idea what im doing but this time when i mounted the first disk with deamon tool i got an error message saying the disc was unreadble by windows"" if you could tell me why that is it would be a help.

however i got another emulation program called magic disc and then this seemed to work up to the point where i selected my language for instalation and a new message has come up saying insert the correct cd-rom .... it says that the error is witht the file fstpe.dll 

do you have any suggestions or can you give me any instrustions step by step onhow to install :)

thnaks"
