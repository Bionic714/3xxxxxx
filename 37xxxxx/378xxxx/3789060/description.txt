Hello,

Hey I am I uploading this because TGC's little members over there really piss me off. 

They have these kindergarten attitudes and have almost no comprehension. Moderators 

are starting to get on my nerves as well. 

I uploaded this to let everyone know that I don't care anymore about trying to help 

people on the forums. All of the little kiddies there can go <locedit> themselves.

Inspire, Underside, and lastly, AaronG, that includes you.
