The author of 6 Gold Medallion Award-winning books challenges Christians to become living answers to a world that desperately wants to know, what's so amazing about grace? Philip Yancey gives the listener a probing and impassioned look at grace: what it looks like - but more importantly, what it doesn't look like. Yancey contends that grace is a concept at the heart of God's plan for salvation, and that it is the responsibility of every Christian to reveal the grace the world is searching for.
