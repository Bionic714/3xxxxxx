,Amerialb,2007-08-30T23:51Z,Does ne1 know the secret to installing the Dreamfleet Bonanza A36 without it crashing FS9 due to the 500_a36.gau file crashing the program?
,TD0607,2007-11-19T18:35Z,"If anyone has this for FSX, I'm VERY interested!  Or maybe there's some trick to make this work with FSX?"
,Oliwa,2008-03-28T15:36Z,Can't get it to work... After the flight loades up the screen goes black and after a while FS9 CTD. Anyone can help me out?
,Kiwi66,2008-04-19T09:50Z,"Try This -
If you have a crash to the desktop when you load the A-10.
Go into the Panel folder which is inside the Aerosoft A-10 aircraft folder and delete the -
Aerosoft A-10 threat warning GAU File.
I had the same problem until i deleted this file, do we need it, who cares, it works, you gets what you pay for......"
,JoeGoFishFSX,2008-06-09T22:41Z,"It will work for FSX


Just put everything into your FSX Folder


gauges etc and effects and all


And then most likely youll get a black bar at the bottom of your screen


So look into its panel cfg file and find this:

[Default View]
X=0
Y=0
SIZE_X=8191
SIZE_Y=XXXX "
