Well, if AJ didn't like it I just HAVE to see it. And probably seed it forever! Thanks fsck!"
,Bennu3924,2007-08-30T05:10Z,"tomtom likes his horse blinders. because using the scientific method is tooo difficult for tomtom. attempt to diprove that which you intend to prove. Through the use of this method the 911 lies fall to pieces at the almighty use of the laws of physics.. buildings cant fall at the speed of 10 floors a second = to a bowling ball falling through air...wow physics what a concept   Alex jones pointed out this was a hit piece long before it was aired. get your facts straight idiot im only downloading this to find provable propaganda through the attempt to prove the absence there of...this does entail work but when 85% of the media is owned by 5 companies you have to work to find the truth now & no your power button is not research. check out 911 a press for truth & begin to realize the majority of truth movements were founded by widows & the majority of hit pieces are supported by those who have financial ties to the lies.. Ps Alex Jones has gone into debt attempting to bring you all the truth, least you can do is attempt to disprove him instead of spitting your unfounded filth. Thank you for seeding."
,please-die-CTers,2007-09-04T01:47Z,"He's gone bankrupt because he is an idiot.  I really wish he would have gone bankrupt sooner.  And isnt this documentary an attempt to disprove the Conspiracy theory hype?  But it's got gov officials in it so of course its propaganda.  Anything that you don't agree with is propaganda .  Please guys help seed this torrent it's time real truth movement formed against the conspiracy theorists.  I like how you pull the old this defies law of physics line, when the scientists and engineers on this show have a better understanding of these laws then you will ever have.
It's a real shame people are using the names of 9-11 victims to push their liberal agenda on gullible Americans.  It's time to fight these nuts, and let the 9-11 conspiracy theories go down the same path as pearl harbor/jfk theories, TO THE GARBAGE."
,tomtomx,2007-09-04T17:05Z,"Intersting how quiet Bennu3924 had been since he actually watched this film...

,duhprane,2007-09-17T13:13Z,"Please download and watch this piece of shit. The target audience for this loser is the 40+ years olds who's maximum extent of research on the ""internets"" goes about as deep as historychannel.com.  Please watch, and you'll know the govt story is horse shit, and you'll know history channel is  just another arm of the Hearst Publishing yellow journalism whore house.

Watch This."
,tomtomx,2007-09-27T21:10Z,Actually the target audience is people who managed to graduate from school and aren't lithium dependant...
,duhprane,2007-10-06T07:00Z,"tomtomx, please that is the lamest shit ever.... I encourage people to watch this, because its soooo fucking weak."
,tomtomx,2007-10-07T14:54Z,Here's another one: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3785698/Inside_9_11__War_on_America
,roscopp,2007-10-25T17:13Z,wow what a load of crap
,theqool,2008-04-26T15:13Z,"Ahh yes, the world is indeed full of nutjobs. Too bad there aren't enough strait jackets to keep up. It is amazing how mindlessly people accept this garbage. Use your brain. The government can't keep anything secret, not wiretapping, nor toture, not anything. How would such a grand conspiracy involving thousands of people ever be kept hidden for more than a week or two before it was leaked to the New York Times?

If you decide to watch this ""fakeumentary the please do your self a favour and check out the links below and read some of the rebuttals to it to make sure you get to hear both sides to the arguments. And to find out how much the makers of this film got right (sadly, pretty much nothing other than the date the attacks occured), how much is unsubstantied rumors and hearsay (quite a bit) and how much is outright lies (all the rest).

A really funny one is
BBC vs. Loose Change ""Truther"" idiots...
http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=24500_Video-_BBC_Truther_Investigation&only

I guess the is okay for a laugh, but there are much better comedies out there.

Did you know that it was actually Bigfoot behind the grassy knoll? He was being telepathically controlled by aliens who were hiding behind a cloud when he bit off Kennedy's head and planted the gun on Oswald."
,luvingfreeedom,2008-10-24T11:57Z,"thegool - Wow... you are an idiot... this ""documentary"" is not endorsing 9/11 conspiracy theories, it is ""DEBUNKING"" them. All of the bullsh it links you provide are along the same lines as this film... 

But thanks for uploading, fsck101. This and the BBC documentary do a great job of showing how the official story has nothing to stand on. "
