This is version 7K:AA from one of Czech(you know, the small country in heart of Europe) game magazine called Level. So some old demos and very good 20 minutes long czechmade film with german subtitles called ""I was teenage intelectual"" with a lot of jokes on philosophers and globalization mainstream culture.

One 7K fan created forum for 7K community. So join here 7k.drupalcafe.com"
,spuriad,2008-08-05T19:25Z,"I managed to install the game using the ISOBuster tool. Everything seemed OK - but when I tried to play, I didn't get the Single Player option to work. It was disabled. I tried several times, using different files... nothing worked.
Help, please...!"
,Colombo_cz,2008-08-05T20:35Z,It is because system dont see CD rom of 7K in your mechanic. Try different virtual drive or different program.
,spuriad,2008-08-05T22:48Z,What if I burn it on a CD and then use it?
,Colombo_cz,2008-08-06T11:15Z,It should be OK
