I am z247 and I made this torrent. The upload will last for a while and I apologise that I cannot speed it up. My ADSL is not the fastest. Sorry.

I have some films that are IMHO worth sharing but I am not sure if there will be anyone who will want to watch them. The problemis that they represent European or Asian cinematography and I do not have any possibility to attach English subs (or hardsubs). The films are like German ""Das Boot"", Italian ""Cinema Paradiso"" or Japanese ""Dolls"" to name few. What do you think, should I seed them? In case of ""Das Boot"" (The Boat) I have choice (German/English). The rest must be coded in their original languages (or Polish...:-)). Personally I prefer to watch foreign language movies in the original language with English subtitles, but I have no idea if the subs are within the reach. What do you think? Should I seed the films? I do not wanna spend quite a lot of time for compressing and seeding movies that no one wants to watch. I have some American and British movies.

And some remarks about the technical side of the movie.
The video codec is Divx 6.6. I found it the best in scenes with smoke, steam and rain. I was surprised that Ateme's H.264 (Nero Recode AVC) and XviD 1.13 performed so bad - I experienced blockiness and strange luma deviations, esp. in dark scenes, even if the settings were set to the max. Moreover, I prefer a MPEG-4 ASP codecs like Divx or XviD because MPEG-4 AVC codecs (like H.264,x.264, etc.) need much stronger (approximately 4 times) machine to play film. I can play them, but the users of weaker machines do not.
The audio codec is Ogg Vorbis. Very good sound quality and relatively small size. I also tried HE-AAC (poor high tones) amd mp3 produced by LAME 3.98 beta 5 (very crippled stereo effects, damn joint stereo!).
The container is Matroska (mkv). It is the consequence of the sound codec - AVIs cannot utilise Ogg Vorbis. I could use OGM, but OGM has larger container overhead.

I know that decent players like The KMPlayer or GOM Player should have no problem with playing the video. I prefer The KMPlayer, but it depends on personal taste - some prefer VLC, etc. Use any you like."
