Freedom: What *is* Fedora?
An operating system, a set of projects, and a mindset. 

What is Fedora? The Fedora Project is a collection of projects sponsored by Red Hat (http://redhat.com) and developed as a partnership between the open source community and Red Hat engineers. The goal of Fedora is the rapid progress of free and open source software and content. Public forums. Open processes. Rapid innovation. Meritocracy and transparency. All in pursuit of the best operating system and platform that free software (http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-sw.html) can provide. 

The operating system is Fedora. It comes out twice a year or so. It's completely Free, and we're committed to keeping it that way. It's the best combination of robust and latest software that exists in the Free software world. 

The mindset is Doing the Right Thing. To us, that means providing Free and open source software, at no cost, freely usable, modifiable, redistributable, and unencumbered by software patents.
