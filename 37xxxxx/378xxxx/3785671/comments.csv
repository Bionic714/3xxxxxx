This is THE ORIGINAL recording from the London production in 1985, the Broadway version - and other versions -  is crap in comparison, they even left out a few songs, and cut others short..
Thanks, will seed this one!"

,theTribble,2008-06-02T21:23Z,"Thanks guys, I've been looking all over for this one, too. This the the best English version of Les Mis there is."
,diplodink,2008-07-02T07:23Z,"Okay I like worship Les Miserables. I saw it twice in London within the last 10 years, twice in Chicago with the touring cast, and at least 3 times in New York, never heard the original cast, but I heard the closing Broadway cast.

I have to agree that the Broadway cast blows the pants off London.

And actually in general, my experience with British theatre is that the acting in London tends to be way better than in New York, but you just can't beat Broadway for musicals.

Thanks for uploading and seeding! Must've bought and lost\scratched this cd a dozen times..."

,glynnsea,2012-06-04T02:21Z,"@rambam1776 Eponine is played by the same person in both the original broadway cast and the original london cast, Frances Ruffelle."
,Coffee42,2012-06-20T08:13Z,Awesome!
