Genus Issues 1 to 76.  Genus is Anthromorphic porn in nature. (Animals in human type form - think Micky Mouse for example)

The files are archived in individual issues.

The format is CBR - Its actually a RAR, but extension changed to CBR.

Reason for this is to use the CBR reader (included in torrent) which makes it easier to view the issues.

If you don\'t want to use reader, then change extension to RAR and un-rar as normal.  Or associate CBR to your RAR program.  :)
