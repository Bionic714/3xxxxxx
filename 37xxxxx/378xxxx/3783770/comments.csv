Yes, you can use these ROMs with your PSP. You need to download PSP GBA emulator which you can download here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3538248/[PSP]GPSP_Game_Boy_advance_Emulator_08__with_gba_bios_included"

,sakuke,2008-11-01T16:55Z,"@STAT2008
what PSP version/firmware is required for this and do we need other emulators to run GPSP bios. I downloaded the one referred by ditthuong but has no idea how to put it into the PSP.. help, pls..anyone.?"
,zappo23,2008-11-02T15:21Z,"if you want a good gba emulator for psp, look up gpsp kai v3.2.  you can put it in your ms0:/psp/game/ folder and it has its own folder to dump the roms into.  in order for it to work, you must download gba_bios.bin and put that in the same folder, otherwise it WILL NOT LOAD."
,nethjay27,2008-12-27T16:57Z,pls seed...

,Infares,2010-02-15T17:38Z,"Generally, if you're seeding that means you're helping other people download it.  I'd watch the Ratio between upload and download and after you're done downloading, leave it up until you've uploaded as much as you've downloaded (1.000 ratio or higher) before you remove the Torrent from your list.  This way you've given back as much as you've taken."
,iTristan,2010-02-19T12:26Z,"Awesome torrent thanks, great speed and great roms.. Thanks for the Dragon Ball Z - Legacy of Goku =)!!!!!!!!! I love that game."
,Cgoff87,2010-03-02T08:32Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! Under your computer registry this will install a program called Dominator Mail 2.0 Which enables a key that will copy and send your Hotmail or Yahoo password to an e-mail called Whoto@hotmail.com. If you did download this go to Run then type regedit, then under hotkey_Current_User/Software/VB and VBA Program settings, right click and delete Dominator Mail 2.0 Inside that folder I found registries of my Hotmail password and e-mail. Kinda shitty Ay? Luckily I dnt use my e-mail but damn!!!"
