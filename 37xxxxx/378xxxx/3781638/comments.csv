,LeBigJuan,2007-08-30T21:55Z,How do you attach the ICU to the 1Click program??
,atis013,2007-08-31T15:24Z,"Before registering, run the program so it bring up the registration window,
remove anything that may be in the registration area, click activate offline, 
then next window that pops up, click activate, it should say something about 
88 characters missing, click ok to exit. Copy the ICU patch to installation 
directory and apply and you'll have a full working version."
