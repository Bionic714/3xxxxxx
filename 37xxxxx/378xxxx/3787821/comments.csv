peace"
,anarchivist,2007-08-29T03:42Z,"oh yea, and thanks for the upload. i am sure Ian (aesop rock) would appreciate you giving his material away that he is already having hard enough time selling the crap. no wonder his stuff has fallen off, kids like you force everything he does to be FREEstyle! some things should remain sacred, and independant hip hop is definately one of them. especially rare breeds like aesop rock.
still peace"

Since you mention money, we should all invest in what drives us, and we'll only know what that is if we're able to find it.  Tell that to the man with all of the money and therefore media control.  Truth.

My man, John Darnielle, has the last word here.  Be well."
,stiyjle,2007-08-29T11:44Z,"Thanx for the upload, the album hasn't been released here yet :/"
,ayalael,2007-09-07T02:44Z,"while these guys are saying that they do not support the downloading music for free scene, ironically they're found on pirate bay, a giant website for searching torrents of free music."
,80hd,2010-06-27T07:16Z,"WHY do people insist on zipping mp3's?

What if I only want one song? is it worth the 3% compression to force me to download a whole album for one song, then have the archive stored on my computer in addition to the extracted copy I listen to, so I can seed the whole thing, again wasting bandwidth, because I wanted one song?

Please don't zip/rar/7zip unless it's something that is actually compressible and most users are likely to only want the full contents."

That's what Limewire is for. "
,FRDS,2010-12-25T05:43Z,Charlie0117: Shutdown. And limewire quality was crap while it lasted.

You are a major tool. For two reasons. First, it's painfully obvious that you're bashing None Shall Pass because it's gotten the most mainstream attention of Aesop Rock's work. Trying to play it off as ""thesaurus scanning"" is complete bullshit. Have you even LISTENED to Catacomb Kids?

Second, you whined about the artist, then came back to make an additional comment dissing the torrent's uploader, insinuating its existence is somehow in bad taste, yet you couldn't have gotten here, let alone this website without the intention of stealing other's intellectual property.

You have a fucking ACCOUNT here, for christsake. 

Tool.

Aesop Rock is a fucking prophet, thanks for the up, jgkilby."
