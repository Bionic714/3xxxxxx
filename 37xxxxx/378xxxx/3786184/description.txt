Well I?m pretty sure Limewire needs no explanation, but the star in the title? Maybe it does. Well in this post I am listing the four different versions that have been released, for most platforms.

LimeWire is a software package which enables individuals to search for and share computer files with anyone on the internet. LimeWire is compatible with the Gnutella file-sharing protocol and can connect with anyone else running Gnutella-compatible software. At startup, the LimeWire program will connect, via the internet, to the LimeWire Gateway, a specialized intelligent Gnutella router, at startup to maximize the user?s viewable network space.LimeWire is a tool that allows you to share files over the internet. Further, the most recent version of Lime Wire enables Group functionality, so that users can connect to other people interested in sharing the same kinds of files that they are.
