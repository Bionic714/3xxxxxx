,markkens,2007-09-02T07:23Z,"How to install it?
Instructions reference a rar that's not in 'crack' folder..."
,Zoracic,2007-09-02T07:50Z,"Just copy and paste the 2 files (not the READ ME) into the install directory.

For XP that would be something like C:\Program Files\NewTek\LightWave 3D 9.3\Programs

Make sure the app isn't running when you do that."
,markkens,2007-09-03T04:51Z,"Nope.  Did, that, still opens in 'exploration'  mode.
License file won't import into registry...tried that just in case.
"
,markkens,2007-09-03T04:56Z,"Thanks!!!  I was cracking in the root, not 'programs' folder like you said...'programs' works!"
,Zoracic,2007-09-03T17:46Z,"Yeah, sorry for the confusion. When I got it was the usual messy RARred, zipped and all sorts of other rubbish you had to do to get to a couple of tiny files.

I'll make sure it's fixed for the next update :-)


---------------------------------------------------
1. Install LightWave3D version 9.3

2. RIGHT CLICK COPY AND PASTE (no need to move them just keep them where they are) THE FILES IN THE CRACK FOLDER INTO INSTALL DIRECTORY = C:\Program Files\NewTek\LightWave 3D 9.3\Programs\**IN HERE***

That install directory is for XP so it'll be different in Vista.



Install instructions again:"
,barnettbeans,2007-09-13T17:41Z,how do i install with vista?? thanks for the upload :D

,tarmik,2007-09-16T01:48Z,dose anyone know where can I find lightwave 9.3 crack for mac?
,imapirate24,2007-10-09T06:23Z,"Hey dude I'm having trouble saving backgrounds, is it an error or theres something wrong with the torrent?"
,TruLife,2007-10-27T00:14Z,"Great upload works perfectly running Vista
For vista its the same thing as whAt to do for xp

great PROGRAM, people in my graphics class will be so jealous"
,tophatfield,2007-11-18T19:03Z,"Go to explore and  expand the program files. Open NewTech- open the Lightwave 3D 9.3 folder. Open the Program folder[ this is the folder that people confuse with the program file that is found in explore or the root] Once opened, paste the two files found in the crack folder- excluding the read me- and reboot. Should be good to go"
,crixeh,2008-01-22T19:13Z,"Anyone know if the crack for the 64-bit version works?

I can't get it to work for me.. it keeps starting up in discovery mode only..."
,yeoldecaptain,2008-01-31T04:39Z,I'd love to download and seed this . . . but . . . . they use Lightwave at the college i atend for graphic arts and it requires a hardware device to work . . . . so how the hell are you guys getting it to work without the hardware USB device?  Just curious.  Is that part of the crack that's bypassing the hardware?
,noekk,2008-03-11T10:38Z,"This is an excellent release.

I installed it with no problems and it works fine on Vista.

When I installed I used 'Custom' and deselected that hardware dongle driver checkbox, I didn't want that shit on my system.

Thanks for the upload Zoracic."
,kipale,2008-03-29T15:35Z,"Huh, the only way I got it to work in Vista is that I made my firewall let every connection through and then when I launch it I first have to elevate hub.exe (run it as administrator) and then run layout/modeler. I bet the crack is fine, but Vista security really gets in it's way.

If you are having problems then just try to disable all your security and then enable them one by one to see what is it. Also don't install the dongle driver, it's unnecessary."
,AnimationGeek,2008-05-11T09:13Z,Does anyone have the intel osx version??
,linkofzelda77,2008-06-03T04:15Z,Could someone help my modeller prog that is with this flashes up then goes off again but the main prog works great help please
,mwebster,2009-03-30T01:01Z,"great, it works! thank you!"
,ginajet,2009-04-19T20:26Z,"This is impossible to install!! I'm not very experienced therefore cannot locate the files advised in previous comments. Can someone help?  Can't find ""crack folder"" or install directory. Sorry, but I need some help."
,gh83fj9,2009-05-23T21:13Z,does anybody have newtek Speededit?
,Anoussa,2010-05-11T14:36Z,"This works 
Thnx for upload 
And good seed (downloaded at 12 minutes)"
,ucalien,2010-06-17T22:35Z,"Dude, the crack you provided DOES NOT WORKS!!!! It's useless to paste the files in the program directory of the Lightwave, 'cause it's still running in limited mode. The advanced functions are BLOCKED, unless we can input the serial code. Your crack doesn't crack anything.

Does anyone here have the serial to this program, please."
,15feb,2010-07-30T21:44Z,"hey guys..at first when i tried to do as readme.txt file says ,,i did everything but it wont worked.Then i remebered how i cracked fl studios!! i just copied the crack named lwtools9.dll from the folder crack-lw96-32bit-SSE2 which came along with the downloaded file and pasted it in the  ""Program"" folder 
see i went like this
opened C drive then went to the program files then newtek >LightWave 3D 9>Programs(here i pasted it)


and then it worked without dumb message sayin this is 30 day trial version :D"
,ItachiNai,2010-07-31T22:42Z,"Good grief what a bunch of helpless newbs.  Seriously, just install the thing, then copy the files in the Crack directory to the installed program directory.
If you're having a difficult time with the easiest crack method ever, maybe you don't want to be trying to mess around with a high-end program like this.
I'd suggest developing those reasoning and logic skills a little bit first, because if you can't follow the simple instructions in the README.txt file in the Crack folder, then you certainly aren't going to be getting anywhere with LightWave any time soon."
,Ayeg3nt,2010-11-06T23:03Z,Works like a charm. Cheers.
,osirisgothra,2011-01-05T07:25Z,"As much as I try to keep cool and not respond to thousands of idiot posts, I just couldn't this time: What the hell is going on in here? Just about everyone posting comments has writing schools worse than a 3rd grader's. No wonder you can't get it to work.. and for those who ""finally"" got it to work, don't act like you know it all--newbies should keep their useless whines and gloats to themselves. I remember back when the only ones online were truly interested in computers themselves... it is sad to see people who can't even find their power button or use the CD tray as a drink holder... someone please start a torrents for dummies site so we don't have to listen to this crap anymore (yeah right...)."
,osirisgothra,2011-01-05T07:27Z,"Those damn auto spell checking features.. skills not schools, by the way."
,stonelesscutter,2011-01-15T17:26Z,Hehehehehhehehe
,stonelesscutter,2011-01-16T19:23Z,"It works just fine.
Easy as pie.
To install that is, not to work with. ;)"
,Cvhtheking,2011-04-30T06:10Z,LOL this is taking forever. . peeps please seed.
,TheGuardian2012,2012-08-20T10:38Z,"@osirisgothra Can you call yourself any different? People have a right to ask questions, but don't have the right to be a hypocrite. People listen too people who are willing to learn, not too people who already claim to know everything, don't let your own arrogance be your downfall. Your grammar is not perfect, nor is anyone's. The English language may be universal, but it is FAR from effective.

         You forget your capitals almost every sentence, which is uh...... First grade stuff, you're complaining about people. who complain and you discriminate and judge others without any true point of evidence, you may say otherwise, you may BELIEVE otherwise, for I will not and cannot stop you. But the truth remains, you and you alone are the partial cause of the slightly unintelligent people because you lack the simplicity to teach others. 

         Also the internet is not a place were smart people go to talk over the ideologies of themselves and the world, it is a tool of globalization, bringing the world much closer together than ever. Because of this you MUST (as you simply do not have a choice) get used to more ignorant people, or simply leave. It's a harsh truth but one non the less. Please try to have a good day and I hope I didn't spoil it, you're better off not responding, you'll be wasting your time. ^_^"
