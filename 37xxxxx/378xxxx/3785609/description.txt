Introduction

Welcome to JustLooking, an image viewing program for Mac OS X. JustLooking is intended to be used as an image viewer instead of the Preview application on your computer for browsing images. In particular, it has the following differences:

    * It focuses on files and directories instead of lists of files. Thus, once you load a file, you can easily navigate through all other files in the same directory.
    * It displays images at their native resolution instead of interpreting DPI information stored in the image meta-data. While images are printed at the maximum resolution possible, on screen they are displayed pixel-by-pixel.
    * Being designed more for viewing of Images, it properly shows animated GIF files.
    * The entire program can easily be manipulated and powered by simple keystrokes for a quick and pleasant viewing experience.
    * JustLooking also supports such basic features as printing and rotating and will hopefully prove to be sufficiently functional for most users? needs.

It should be noted that the application is not designed to completely replace Preview, as there are a number of features in the latter that JustLooking simply does not have, such as selecting and copying regions, saving images in various formats, and viewing of Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) files.
