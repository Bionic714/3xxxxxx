[T],Shanklys Love Child,2007-09-06T14:11Z,"Thanks Bluegamba. I'm enjoying your mixtapes too and there's always stuff on them hat I haven't come across. Looking forward to the Mavis Staples, Robbers On High Street, and Marike Jager - all new to me. I gave the Coral album one listen and wasn't too struck by it, so will have to go back and give it another listen. Cheers!"
