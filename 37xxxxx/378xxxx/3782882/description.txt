The albums of Okkervil River and The Coral are, of course. recommended. Nice are the ones by White Rabbits and Eisley. Caribou is great, but "The Milk Of Human Kindness" was better. Rilo Kiley is not what you expected. I found it an album full of lyrics with sexual undercurrents: masochism, sex with minors, masturbation, whoring, blowjobs and one-night stands. It's all there and not just my wishful thinking, thank you. All this to shameless '70's popmusic. Hmmm. Twisted Abba and Fleetwood Mac by Rilo Kiley. 
But listen to the song by Marike Jager. Great keyboards, great song.
