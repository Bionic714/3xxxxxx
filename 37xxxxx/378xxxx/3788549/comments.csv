You've got some great stuff up here, too bad it's ALL IN MP3.

MP3 is a ""lossy"" compression method, that means during compression data is lost. That means MP3 is unsuitable for critical listening. Try using FLAC instead, a lossless compression format.

peace!"
,hazmat2,2008-11-22T20:40Z,FLAC isn't lossless
,chughtai,2009-05-17T01:09Z,"FLAC ""IS"" lossless."
,kleftisaa,2010-08-16T02:55Z,"Talk about a fast d/load!
Thanks for the torrent."
,Snakepit_,2010-10-28T05:10Z,FLAC is lossless. 'FLAC' stands for 'free lossless audio codec'.
,drone108,2011-01-09T19:22Z,"ALL digital music has data lost.
Go listen to Jaco on LP for a pure experience."
,RC_Ebooks,2011-10-07T09:42Z,"Hey steveWHINE,
You've got some nerve up here, too bad it's ALL unfounded.

FLAC is a ""spacy"" compression method, that means during compression disk space is lost. That means MP3 is suitable for preserving it. Try using BUYING instead, a a thief is one thing but a WHINING thief with NO DICK is worse!
Get a piece! "
,UhOk,2012-05-12T10:15Z,"I'm sure that all of us who love music would use FLAC if we could. The fact of the matter is that many people use Apple products to listen to their music when they're out, and unfortunately iTunes and Apple devices don't play FLAC.

And, in any case, FLAC files are as big of a waste of space as ripping all of your albums as .WAV files. Unless you're playing this through a hi-fi stereo system that cost more than most people's cars, you won't be able to tell the difference between an mp3 ripped at >192kbps and a FLAC file, and this rip's 250kbps VBR bitrate more than satisfies that requirement.

So, thanks for the album, and go and buy the vinyl if you're really a stickler for sound quality."
