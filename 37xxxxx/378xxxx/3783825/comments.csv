Why do they still keep making theese ""point and click""-rpg's?? It´s 2007 ffs! Not 1997....
To bad... except for the controls I think this could have been a quite nice game.
I personally don´t like this untasteful mixes of genres. Let rpg´s be rpg's, look at the greatest of the last 10 years, oblivion, zelda64, FFVII, to name same.... they all follow the same control-schematic. No gottdamn top-down view where you can zoom out and see beyond 5 hills and plan the attack-bullshit.
Leave simulation-crap to ppl who enjoy command and conquer-games.

Too bad, and I feel bad for the developers, they COULD have made a big buck on this one. Now they will probably have to shut down. Cause this way...It stinks!"

Either this game is really buggy or the crack is really messed up. Just a heads up here, I really like the game its more or less another Diablo clone IMHO. Any ideas or help would be greatly appreciated."
