New film from award-winning documentary maker John Pilger which suggests that, far from bringing 
democracy to the world as it claims, the US is doing its best to stifle its progress. 

Talking exclusively to American government officials, including agents who reveal for the first 
time on film how the CIA ran its war in Latin America in the 80s, Pilger argues that true popular 
democracy is more likely to be found among the poorest in Latin America, whose movements are often 
ignored in the West.
