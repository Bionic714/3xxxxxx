,Deathofrats,2007-08-29T11:14Z,"Nevermind, I'm regular seeding this.  Super Seeding doesn't work how I thought it did."
,Deathofrats,2007-09-04T04:40Z,"There really isn't any proper order.  Some of the tracks have an order in game, but most of them you play using jukeboxes.  "
,Verwandlung-,2007-09-08T14:14Z,I salute you.
,duzmi,2007-09-10T10:58Z,Thank you for the 21 tracks. Shame there seems to be 2 missing. Managed to track down 'Liza-Django Reinhardt' but having no luck so far finding  'It had to be you-Danny Thomas'
,kyrkbymannen,2007-09-11T21:51Z,Cruel!!! Thanks!

,freddieshell15,2008-01-01T14:59Z,Like to say that there is Quite a fair bit of spelling mistakes in and out of this torrent..........though im not the one to complain ;)
,MyOthrRide,2008-01-13T11:57Z,Been looking for this. Thank you.
,fullautosniper,2008-03-11T21:08Z,I'm definitely not removing this from my seeding list for a while. this is awesome
,nutgraph,2008-04-17T10:59Z,Gravy_t is correct about the 9 songs that are missing (you can view the list for yourself at http://majornelson.com/archive/2007/10/11/bioshock-music-list.aspx ).  But having these 21 songs already gathered together makes this little project MUCH easier to finish.  Gotta show Deathofrats the man-love for this upload.
,anarchistruler,2008-06-29T23:13Z,SEED! for the love of god seed. Must...fuel...bioshock...obsession.
,rainbowfied,2008-09-14T20:09Z,"What's that guys?
