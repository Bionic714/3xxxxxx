,key-,2007-10-13T09:12Z,Please seed.
,doedensbanan,2007-12-07T16:16Z,"How do I install this game? There is no setup file... And how do I use the update patch? When I open it, it just says ""No installation of Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom found on this computer. You cannot install this update."""
,rose684,2008-04-25T12:10Z,Just Extract The Files With Winrar 
,falcis,2008-09-01T22:17Z,"a good game, please seed it"
,stoffe1100,2008-09-15T16:14Z,How do i install update? it just says: no installation of emperor found
,paschalx,2008-09-21T14:50Z,Hi. Where's the CD keys? I can't find it.
,flowingsolder,2009-04-03T03:57Z,wow nice speed for 4 seeders
,pooh_200591,2009-06-05T21:41Z,why doesn't this torrent work after I downloaded from the below link? 
,italian3034,2009-06-21T05:39Z,Nice Game Add More Soon!!!!
,LeaT,2009-07-18T13:02Z,"Gosh. A lot of people don't know the basics.

1) Download the torrent
2) Extract the .rar file with either Winzip or Winrar or any other program that can open and extract .rar files
3) Download Daemon Tools, Alcohol 120% or similar program
4) Mount images with said program
5) Install the game when the autorun pops up
6) Investigate the mounted file with the OS's search engine for any folder called Crack or similar, that hints it contains the crack files + CD key or program that generates it for you
6) Install the patch
7) Crack the game
8) PLAY!

Not harder than that. If the patch doesn't work, it means you cracked the game before you patched it, which is the wrong order of doing it. Reinstall the game, reapply the patch and then crack it."
,LeaT,2009-07-18T13:06Z,"Additionally, the description above applies to 99% of all game torrents."
,LeaT,2009-07-18T14:10Z,"I have now downloaded this torrent so I can now say for 100% what is wrong: and that is that this torrent is a COPY of a cracked version of the game after it was installed on someone else's computer, instead of coming with the original CD. It seems to be a good crack, but the reasons you cannot patch the game is because it's cracked (and I believe the game is already patched as well). 

A very weird torrent, I must say, considering it is not a copy of the original CD but rather the installation itself. 

Anyway, it seems to work fine, but you do need to unrar all the files into a folder or your computer will be forced to unrar the files all the time everytime you wish to play the game. At least that does save some hassle. 

So this torrent certainly is considered to be one of those rare 1% that is not installed the way I described previously."
[V],azizex666,2010-04-27T21:03Z,"Thanks for the upload!
and Thanks to all the seeders for keeping it going!"
,light24bulbs,2010-07-21T07:05Z,"great speed for so few seeders.  i have loved this game since it came out, and still wish to play it. i own a few copies but want to play on my netbook which doesnt have a cd drive.  this is the cloud solution to my desktop not working.  Anyone else who still plays this is solid."
,Alexandru_I,2011-01-28T19:07Z,"Yes, it's a good game with nice graphics. It's old, but fun to play. I have the original, but i thought i'd post a comment."
,1shidiwen1,2011-03-13T19:24Z,the awesomest thing is that people are asking how to set it up and you only have to run the exe file and it starts without needing to install
,blycan,2011-03-20T06:52Z,"since its cracked and u dont need to install it, does the multiplayer still work on it?"
,mihaihen,2011-04-25T12:14Z,"Easy, just extract and play. Thank's, i had the original cd of this game, but it stopped working, i think it is damaged(on acount of how old it is), i got it back when the game went out :-s"
,Geek307,2011-06-23T15:21Z,"It's not hard to install... It's already patched and cracked... all that's needed is to unrar, open up the file then double click the emperor logo... which is found next to dragon... your game will then start up. Tada!  "
,Tony_-,2011-06-29T03:48Z,I wouldnt suggest to download. Nothing wrong with the torrent it works perfect. Its just not patched.. Monuments missing along with some other features. If you consider that its not important to patch then this will do.
,Twauk,2011-08-30T01:12Z,"Hey guys this is a great game, and I just found out you can still play online if you go into the readme.exe and delete something, so if anybody wants to play online Email me at ThatDudeAaron@gmail.com. See you guys online!"
,thunderlungz425,2012-05-13T06:13Z,"You people are dumb as shit. You don't even have to install this morons, just double click on the Emperor.exe file. If you dumbasses can't find it, it's the application right underneath the Dragon icon. Of caurse you have to unrar it first in case your all that stupid. GET OFF THE PIRATE BAY IF YOU CAN'T FIGURE SOMETHING THIS EASY OUT."
,thunderlungz425,2012-05-13T06:19Z,"I didn't realize so many other people explained it until now, I only read as far as Light24bulbs's comment. if i would have read 2 more comments I wouldn't have added mine"
