,FaeG,2007-12-18T12:33Z,I don't think those are the right names... Where's Dirty Acres? I thought they've only produced 3 albums...
,tmace_6,2008-01-31T06:14Z,"they've got 4 albums out: Southernunderground, Will Rap 4 Food, A Piece of Strange and Dirty Acres. 
The rest of the albums you see are either mixtapes or compilations they appear on. "
,tmace_6,2008-01-31T22:56Z,"I downloaded this torrent. It includes: will rap for food, southernunderground, a piece of strange, sloppy seconds 1 & 2. does not include dirty acres-must download seperately"
