New single from One Republic.  It appeared on Timbaland's album [i]Shock Value[/i], but is now being released as the first single from One Republic's new album.

This song was heard on Season 3 of Fox's [i]So You Think You Can Dance[/i] as well as the first episode on Season 3 of MTV's [i]The Hills[/i].

This version has a guest verse from Former Fat Boys ([url=http://www.myspace.com/formerfatboys]http://www.myspace.com/formerfatboys[/url]) rapper $ucksex.  Its my favorite version.
