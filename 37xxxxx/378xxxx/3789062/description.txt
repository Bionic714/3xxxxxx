Profile:


Hybrid is Mike Truman and Chris Healings from Swansea, South Wales. They are the accomplished architects of house and progressive breakbeat who ventured further beyond the ecstatic knee-jerk response of the dancefloor by fusing their beats with powerful orchestral and cinematic soundscapes.

After DJing separately at Welsh clubs throught the late 80's and early 90's, Hybrid formed back in 1993 after bonding over Truman's remix of Pink Floyd's 'Another Brick In The Wallâ??. Their 1999 debut LP (with former member Lee Mullin) 'Wide Angle' sold a total of 100,000 copies world wide. "We like making music that will last," explains Healings. "Music that isn't disposable. We want people to listen to it over and over again in the future." "Music you can play before you go out and listen to when you chillout," continues Truman.

Hybrid have collaborated with artists such as New Order's Peter Hook, The Pretender's Chrissie Hynde, Kirsty Hawkshaw, Julee Cruise and the 90-piece Russian Federal Orchestra.

Hybrid has also remixed over 40 artists including Radiohead, 2 Bad Mice, Alanis Morissette, Carl Cox, BT, The Future Sound Of London and Moby.
