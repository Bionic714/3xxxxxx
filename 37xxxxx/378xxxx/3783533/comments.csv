,Shwaffle,2007-09-28T10:09Z,When it asks for CD2 you need to mount The second CD Image to Daemon tools.
,Shwaffle,2007-09-28T10:30Z,"Ha. Well for those that have yet to download this. The crack is IN THE SECOND CD! 

When the image is mounted, open up the ""Drive"" and there's a folder called ""Crack"" Simply drag the HipHop6 there to the folder in which you installed Hip Hop 6 and it will overwrite it.

Tested and works :)"

,diudhan,2010-02-01T15:34Z,how to install?
,ixiunidotixi,2010-02-06T08:07Z,"Okay people theres a few ways to do this.
1) you can burn both cds...install...copy the crack into the original install folder from cd 2

2) you can mount the image(Hip-Hop Ejay6 CD1.bin for you noobs) with you favorite program (power iso, alcohol 120%, ect.) then it will ask for the next disc. unmount the image (Hip-Hop Ejay6 CD1.bin) and mount (Hip-Hop Ejay6 CD2.bin), after that is done copy the crack into the original install folder off the second image.

3)you can extract both Hip-Hop Ejay6 CD1.bin and Hip-Hop Ejay6 CD2.bin into a folder of your choice install it and copy the crack into the original install folder"
