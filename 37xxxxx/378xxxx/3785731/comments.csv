Are you having some kind of technical difficulties? Or is this a big joke on RPG-loving leechers? There's no point to uploading torrents that you can't seed to completion."

,SwedishElk,2008-03-25T00:39Z,Is there any seeder on this one? According to BT there are 0(0) and 36 leechers. I will gladly seed it if I get to 100%.
,Urr.4,2008-12-16T23:15Z,"Yeah, i would also be very glad if there would be any seeder. i too will seed"
,Nachtholm,2009-02-03T07:13Z,No kidding. This is the best WOD set I've found so far. Too bad I'm stuck at 66%...
,FalconW,2009-07-11T05:49Z,I'm stuck at 32.6% can anybody tell me where I could finish a download? Trying to startup a decent campaign.
