Today I came across a film made in 2005 which stars Pavel Barshak who was immense in Progulka / The Stroll , but has only appeared in a few films since then.   The cast list is hugely impressive, and kind of reads like this:

Andrei Merzlikin - Bimmer , Okhota na Piranyu , Obratnyy otschet 
Andrei Krasko -Odna lyubov na million , Piter Fm , Svolochi , Zhmurki , Turetskiy gambit / Turkish Gambit 
Viktor Sukhorukov - Ostrov / The Island , Zhmurki , Ne hlebom edinym / Not by Bread Alone , Brat 1 , Brat 2 , Antikiller
Vyacheslav Razbegayev - Zhest , Antikiller , Lichnny Nomer 
Mariya Shalayeva - Bimmer

The film opened in Russia in early 2005 raking up close to $3million at the Russian box office, the film looks and sounds fun, not much information can be found on it sadly, there are no english reviews to be found.  

A synopsis I found reads like this

'A clerk ends up with blood on his hands, the boss' wife on his lap, and the police drawing closer

A student has found a perfect way to increase both his reading progress and his income. Working as a night time clerk he's planning to spend the night reading and resting. However, the night doesn?t quite proceed as intended, and the clerk ends up with blood on his hands, the boss' wife on his lap, and an investigator at the door, searching for a serial killer.

GRAVEYARD SHIFT is a grotesque comedy where one mistake leads to another. The poor student spins himself into a web he seemingly can?t escape from'
