,Muffin_75,2007-11-12T09:00Z,"Sorry I am stuck! What shall I do with the rarfile?
How do I install? plz help me!"
,Unfathomable,2008-01-05T08:27Z,"Download Winrar to uncompress a rar file, then you can see the files inside and instal from there."
,ofbk1,2008-01-09T19:54Z,"Hey
Download and unpack with rar, but now I got to bin-files. What shall I do with these?? Please help !"
,ofbk1,2008-01-09T19:55Z,"Soory I ment two binfiles, and nothing else - no exefile or instalfile"
,SnuffBot,2008-02-02T05:32Z,"Yeah im having the same problem, every other time ive used winrar ive had an instal file"
,corthew,2008-02-16T04:59Z,bin files are image files. you open them with a program that recognizes bin/cue files. usually their is a .cue file with the .bin file but the .cue file is not needed in most cases. You cannot just copy the file to a cd. you have to use a program designed for that like nero. Magic iso may handle bins. alchohol120% maybe. try searching for bin in applications and see if it finds a mounting program.
,BlowBye,2008-03-08T18:26Z,Excellent! Many thanks for this one.
,mrfz,2008-03-26T21:58Z,"thanks, but why not share these in some sensible manner, like .iso or at least include cue files?"
,naderraslan,2008-04-25T16:28Z,seed me please
,U_Rebel_Scum,2008-09-15T01:12Z,"For those of you confused by the ""bin"" files...

I used WinRar to ""un-rar"" the rar files then used MagicIso 5.3 to burn the CDs from the bin files.

CD 1 is the Band in a Box program, CD 2 is the ""real Drums"" expansion.

The real drums sound awesome!

Easy install, no serial number.  Everything works!!

Great up load.

I'll seed at night when not using the computer."

,xho,2009-04-14T01:15Z,Works fine! Thanks!
,iray8t,2010-01-31T15:06Z,Once I figured out how to use the 2 bin files to burn the 2 disks (I used Toast on my Mac since my numerous attempts under Windoz proved fruitless!) the whole thing installed flawlessly and works just great! Thanks!
