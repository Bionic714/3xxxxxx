,simkusdavid,2009-07-22T19:35Z,"This one is great, Thank you so much. Im seeding. The only little problem I have is the video shows a little weird motion lines, but it really isn't too bad. For those of you who are having sound or video problems just try downloading an updated Vista or XP codec pack. I have a Vista pack and this video plays great. IT would also be great if it was in 16:9 for my monitor. :P Anyways thanx guys. Now please upload ""Girls of Mischief"""

Personally, i found it unenjoyable due to that fact."
