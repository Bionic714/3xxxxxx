Bachman-Turner Overdrive (BTO)	Head On	[1975], 192 kbps

I have been searching or ages for this album. Other BTO albums are pretty easy to come by but i never saw a live torrent that included this album (yet), even though it's one of their better works and the last album with Randy Bachman, who shortly after left the band.

Find Out About Love	
It\'s Over	
Average Man	
Woncha Take Me For A While
