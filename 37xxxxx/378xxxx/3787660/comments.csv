,abuAmar,2007-08-28T23:44Z,thanks for the up of this fine movie.  are there english subs embedded in the file??
[T],z247,2007-08-29T08:14Z,"Unfortunately the subtitles are not embedded:-(. This film was released in Poland, so I could embed only Polish or Italian (I think) subtitles. So I decided to make the film ""saute"".

BTW, something is wrong with the PB - I have problems with seeding the torrent. I had similar one some days ago, when I seeded Apocalypse Now Redux (actually I am still seeding the movie, I always seed 24 hours longer than first users have full copies of the file). Peers are appearing and disappearing. According to the PB statistics six people downloaded the torrent metafile, but I see only one peer (a Comcast user, I think from Washington). Is it you? Do not worry, I will seed the film, but some breaks may occur.   

PS I also published this torrent in MiniNova.com, just in case if this tracker dies.

BTW, I also asked users if seeding films whichare not spokeninEnglish is a good idea. I have some good films like ""Das Boot"", ""Stalingrad"", ""Dolls"", ""Run Lola run"" or some others, but without English subs (only the Polish ones, sorry but many films are published like that in Poland). Do you think I should seed them?"

I asked my friends for ""Cinema Paradiso"" with subtitles. I have good and bad news.

Good news: one of my friend has the Italian edition of the film. It is much longer than the international edition - almost 3 hours and contains English subs!

Bad news: unfortunately, the audio is stereo only and the DVD is single layer (the Polish one is double layer with both DD and DTS) and I will be able to borrow the DVD on Monday or Tuesday. My machine is rather strong so coding it should take approximately 4-5 hours. No problem.

So let's do like that: I will rerelease this film next week. I see that there are two peers on Sumotracker.com, so I will finish seeding this torrent anyway. 

I promise I will seed the film in the version you request next week. "
