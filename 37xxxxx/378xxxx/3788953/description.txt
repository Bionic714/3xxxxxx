=====================================================================

A father says goodbye to his young daughter and leaves. As the wide Dutch landscapes live through their seasons so the girl lives through hers. She becomes a young woman, has a family and in time she becomes old, yet within her there is always a deep longing for her father.

Father and Daughter is a film about longing, the kind of longing which quietly, yet totally, affects our lives
