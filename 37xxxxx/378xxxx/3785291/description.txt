In 1984 Atlanta released the MCA Album titled simply Atlanta which contained the single releases "Sweet Eyed Georgia Girl" and "Can't Ya Hear That Whistle Blow". This album also was certified RIAA gold for sales of over 500,000 copies, in spite of what critics called a 'softening' of their musical style, much due to the changes in the production team, and the use of Nashville studio musicians in addition to the band members.
