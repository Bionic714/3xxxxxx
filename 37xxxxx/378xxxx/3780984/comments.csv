[V],lord_terabyte,2007-08-22T11:57Z,how can this movie be downloaded 6 times 20 minutes after I first upload the torrent???
,rogard,2007-08-22T14:41Z,"@lord_terabyte:

""downloaded"" means how many people DL'ed the torrent info, not the torrent itself.


Cool Movie, BTW. Slow, with some quirks, but you can see where Scott will be going from there. Sadly, this kind of film are no longer made, everything is so fast nowadays.

If you're a cinema fan, this is a must have!"

,mick-146,2008-07-31T17:08Z,"I have the same question - does anybody know if it is possible to remove the commentary from the main-movie avi file? Or indeed, how can one get in touch with the uploader (lord_terabyte) to request that he lindly uploads a non commentary version?

Thanks."

Hope that helps."

,scottielass,2010-01-23T15:46Z,"A million thanks for making this terrific movie available. I saw it when it was originally released and always wanted to see it again. It's a must-see, with a great cast.

Re. the director's comments -- I didn't download all the available files and had no comments. You can just download the avi file for the movie and nothing else, unless you want the subtitles, or delete the other files after downloading."
