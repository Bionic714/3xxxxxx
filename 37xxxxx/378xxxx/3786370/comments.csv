,captainleg,2007-08-28T21:13Z,I can't for some reason... could you just post a serial and registration on here?
,efowotg,2007-09-02T16:40Z,set .nfo standard opening program to notepad or something similar
,natanistof,2007-10-09T13:34Z,"hi,
can someone help me i do not know what to do with the 38 files

can someone plx help me because i realy want this software

thx"
,artytorrent,2007-10-11T22:32Z,"Somewhat annoyingly, you have to UnRAR 37 compressed files into one folder, even though the 37 files contain more RAR files, labelled part 1-39
Once you've got them, run Setup.exe in the first one and the installation routine should start. It's relatively painless from then on. The NFO contains a list of serial numbers and registration codes. You need to enter one for each ""Studio Instrument"" when you load it in your sequencer.
I copied and pasted and got an ""incorrect code"", but the programme worked fine.

This VSTi (and standalone synth) is basically a ROMpler. It contains some built-in patterns (a bit like those on a casio keyboard) which serve as demos, but what you really need to know is the quality of the samples. Well, the strings are pretty good, as are the bass guitars. The electric piano is a fairly average version of a Fender Rhodes. The drumkit is a basic ""acoustic kit"", but you can fine tune each instrument.
The odd thing is that the installation program copies over a bunch of WAVs and SFZ files, but the samples are encrypted, so you can't dispense with the user interface and just play the sounds with your normal sampler or SFZ VSTi.
Fortunately, the graphical display of the instruments is quite pretty, and the CPU load isn't too heavy. If you've already got good multisamples of the included instruments, then you don't need this, but if you want to see a virtual bass being strummed, or a cello being bowed, give this a try.

Thanks for uploading."
,artytorrent,2007-10-11T22:35Z,There is a duplicate of this at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3787801/Cakewalk.Studio.Instruments.VSTi.v1.0-BEAT which includes the full NFO with serial/registration info.
,mvpguerra,2007-10-15T01:14Z,"This is an excelent piece of software. Thanks a lot! But somehow I can't manage to enter the reg code. I entered the last serial on the info, but the corresponding registration code doesn't seem to work... (all done by copy/paste).
Can anyone help me please? Thanks."

,captainferret,2008-01-27T05:23Z,"Don't let all the zip files get you down. I found a program called UNZIPLIFY. All you have to do is right click on the file containing all the zip files, does not matter how many of them there are. The program will unzip all zipped files, place them all inside another folder minus repeated files. That's it! If unziplify does nothing but unzip a bunch of other zips, keep doing the same thing, eventually you'll get the original files. It's great and I do believe still freeware. Just google it."
,arverevdal,2008-03-05T14:41Z,"I don't understand how to do anything, cause everytime i try to open te winrar file i get an error. It always says that i have to get the next part before the one i'm opening at the moment. What am I doing wrong?"
