,killa klown,2007-08-28T06:38Z,is this the rob zombie remake? what's the quality?
,Xeyel,2007-08-28T06:47Z,"It's a work-release...Missing some final editing touches and doesn't include final reshoots.  Will be slightly different from the Theatrical release.  This is still very watchable though.

,pirategurl,2007-09-07T17:05Z,Am I the only one who sees Property of Dimention Films written on the top screen? 
,DeltaPan,2007-09-08T22:53Z,"Your point being pirategurl???

A lot of the screener versions are tagged like that."
,toxicnat,2007-09-09T05:55Z,"Cams are better dude. When I see a nice cam by a HD camera on my widescreen.... Pumping out Dolby, its crazy! make sure they are quality cams, not shitty Theatrical BULL!"
,DeltaPan,2007-09-09T18:20Z,"I liked this.

However i am not fussy about quality etc.

Whoever tooled this needs lessons in re-encoding etc.

Whilst it is a very good film, be aware that the quality is pretty dire, sound out of sync and vid quality leaves a lot to be desired.

If you just want to see the film and are not fussy, go with this.

If quality is an issue with you, don't download it, wait for a decent TS Cam version to hit the networks.

Note to releaser and uploader, i am not complaining.
Thanks for this, i enjoyed it, just a heads up for the fussy people!"
