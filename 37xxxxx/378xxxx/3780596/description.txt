FalterCon 2007, an impromptu gathering of Haiku users, developers and supporters initiated spontaneously by the community in response to the last minute cancellation of the WalterCon 2007 conference by the Haiku project. FalterCon 2007 took place on August 11, as part of the Linux 16th Anniversary Picnic held at the Sunnyvale Baylands Park.
