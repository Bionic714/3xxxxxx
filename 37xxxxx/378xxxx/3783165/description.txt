Synopsis
ItÂ´s the legendary James Stewart at his leading-man finest in this timeless western that set the standard for all that followed. Frontiersman Lin McAdam (Stewart) is attempting to track down both his fatherÂ´s murderer and his one-of-a-kind rifle, the Winchester Â´73, as it passes among a diverse group of desperate characters, including a crazed highwayman (Dan Duryea), an immoral gunrunner (John McIntire), a savage young Indian chief (Rock Hudson) and McAdamÂ´s own murderous brother (Stephen McNally). Featuring Shelley Winters as the rifleÂ´s only rival for McAdamÂ´s interest and Tony Curtis in one of his first screen performances, the gripping tale of the men (and gun) who won the West is one of StewartÂ´s most memorable films and one of the genreÂ´s most enduring classics.
