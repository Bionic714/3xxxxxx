,revroach,2008-08-27T06:59Z,"Hint on how to burn.
Not all versions of Nero will burn KVCD.
It seems to want standered vcd setting wich is not a KVCD.
The simple way is to get VCDEasy, it will still tell you there is a problem as its checking the file but I've never had one not come out.
If you know how to use any burning software you can use VCDEasy"
