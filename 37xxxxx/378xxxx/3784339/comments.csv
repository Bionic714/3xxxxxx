,SiCkByDeFiniTiOn,2007-09-17T11:17Z,"Come on people it really doesn't hurt to seed, don't move the file after you dload it and while you watch an episode let others download off you. I mean all you do is not click stop after its finished dloading ok? thanks."
,SiCkByDeFiniTiOn,2007-09-17T11:19Z,"The more you seed, the faster others go up, even if you have a cap conenction the more people i am dloading off the faster...i have 5 people i am dloading off 4 below 1kb/s and 1 of them 5kb/s ...if you guys help out and seed it won't take a week :( thanks."

,chookymeister,2009-12-13T13:52Z,"pro tip for ppl who dont seed:

use something like utorrent that allows you to choose where to download the files to and which files, and download the torrent DIRECTLY to the right spot on your hard drive
(eg i always download office episodes into .../TV Shows/The Office (US)/...)

then you DONT have to move to remove the torrent and you can be like me and seed torrents nonstop"
