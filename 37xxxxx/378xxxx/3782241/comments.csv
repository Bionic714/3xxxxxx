now there is one other way, and that is for the palestinians to get housebroken and stop peeing
on the floor carpet, go to work and build up their country, so they can say""look here"" this we have done, now recognize us as a sovereign state.
stop all the monkeybusiness and grow up."
,xenomech,2007-08-24T00:46Z,"I'm guessing this movie doesn't show how these ""war crimes"" were just more lies made up by the Arab Israelis (aka Palestinians)?

""The events were initially referred to as the ""Jenin massacre"", due to widely reported allegations ? raised by Palestinian officials ? that the IDF killed hundreds of civilians in the camp. This allegation was later proven wrong, and the death toll was lowered to 23 Israeli soldiers and 52 Palestinians, 22 of whom were unarmed civilians. According to pro-Israel online sources, families of some of the 23 Israeli soldiers killed brought a lawsuit against the Israeli Defense Forces and the Government of Israel contending that the IDF erred on the side of protecting Palestinians in the conflict area.""

,jikbag,2007-08-24T21:27Z,"Even the IDF put the number of Palestinian dead in the hundreds.  The Israelis kept out international observers for several days.  It was only after Israel had time to clean up that the number of dead dropped into the 50s.

""The International Committee of the Red Cross yesterday accused Israel of breaching the Geneva conventions by recklessly endangering civilian lives and property during its assault on the Jenin refugee camp, and by refusing the injured access to medical personnel for six days.""

,tomtomx,2007-08-26T23:31Z,"Shit! Are there still people that actually believe in this propaganda film!!? Even after it came out that the numbers of dead etc were largely overrated (First claimed by the palestinian authorities to be hundreds and later after international help workers arrived, quickly revised the number of dead to 56. (56 palestinian fighters, 20 something israeli. Not much of a massacre... )
The palestinian filmmakers staged lots of scenes to make this film in best Pallywood style. Watch the movie Pallywood to get a grip http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_B1H-1opys

,tomtomx,2007-08-26T23:55Z,"Could someone please upload the movie ""Road to Jenin"". I don't have it anymore, but it sure exposes every little lie of Jenin, Jenin... If I don't remember it wrong it amongst other things show that hilarious scene were a group of mourning palestinians carry a stretcher with a ""victim"" in front of a TV camera. One of the mourners trip, the corps falls of the stretcher, gets on his feet and quickly climbs up on the stretcher again, so the parade can continue mourning his death..."
