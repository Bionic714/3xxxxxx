,hablestop,2007-08-29T04:01Z,i hope this works!!
,BlackDahlia,2007-09-10T00:52Z,"Worked like a charm! The one thing that I did find out is that it does NOT like it if you use the hub USB ports (the auxilliary ones on the front of the PC). It failed time after time on the front ports but worked wonderfully on the dedicated ports on the back of the PC. Thanks. 

I have a unit that converts VHS to DVD (DVDXpress DX2) that is the same way.

Now I know that it works and is worth the $35 to buy I will order a copy. Always nice to try software before committing to buy it."
