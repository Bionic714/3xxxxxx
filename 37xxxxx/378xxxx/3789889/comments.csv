If the purpose is to inspire people to have a more critical perspective, why is it presented with an obvious agenda of its own?

That said, I very much appreciate the publisher's statement that people should not just believe the material presented, but should discover and think for themselves."

Would be nice to see some intelligent criticism about these kinds of movies that try to show us how narrow view of things the mass media offers and that we don't think for ourselves nearly enough..
""This film doesn't give you the absolute truth about things so it is all *curses*"". That kind of ""logic"" is all too common with people critisizing these kinds of movies. 
I understand why it must feel awful for some media workers, these kinds of movies do their real job. They try to fix the lack of important ideas and information what the mass media should'v published a long time ago.
Of course we should debate about things, but we should also get the chance to do so. We need to hear more information about important things, from different points of view, but the general public is being denied from that opportunity."

MUST WATCH AND DISTRIBUTE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ALL. may god bless you all, regardless to your caste, color and creed."
