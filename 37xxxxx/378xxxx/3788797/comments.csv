I am seeding, just not 24/7. As of 19th September, several peers are at 98% and rising but no-one has quite got to 100% as yet (maybe later tonight, maybe tomorrow, maybe later). 
Incidentally, the DVD is PAL format which will work on pretty much any PC but stand-alone DVD players in NTSC countries such as North America or Japan won't play it unless they're PAL compatible.

Good enough to watch, but not worth burning to a disc (though, to be fair, many thanks to that uploader as well!).

Really appreciate both the upload and your seeding, perhaps re-muxing the stereo sound from the little .avi version with yours might improve things a bit somewhere down the road, it's not a big deal in the greater scheme of things, is it?

You've done all of us Viv and Bonzos fans a *huge* favor sharing your rip of this, so thanks a million!"
