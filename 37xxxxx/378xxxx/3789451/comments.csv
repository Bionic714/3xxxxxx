,dainvada,2007-09-04T00:58Z,Yeah i had computer problems so instead of seeding it was downloading them all still sorting it out
,pepsimax66,2007-09-06T19:38Z,"come on, please keep seeding. I've been downloading this for almost a week now!"
,pepsimax66,2007-09-07T19:19Z,Anyone else nearly finished with this one? Im at 99%
,banisters,2007-09-26T11:14Z,"Has anyone managed to dl ANY of this guys torrents completely? I've tried to dl R.K.Nightmares Season 1-3 without any sucess. The first season stops at 99,9% and them others at something similar. Is this one worth trying,or does it have the same problem?"
,MM2007,2007-11-08T00:50Z,"I've been able to download all three of his torrents.  Some within 24 hours.  You may want to upgrade to the latest version of BitTorrent.  The latest version seems to manage the files much better.

Yes, I'm seeding seasons 2 and 3 (lost the seed for 1 when I upgraded)

/Cheers!"
