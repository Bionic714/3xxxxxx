,HUGODK,2007-08-24T10:05Z,Hi What is this a game or a weather program?
,Codee91691,2007-08-26T01:46Z,"This is a Program for FSX, it provides EXCELLENT weather and the most acurate for FSX. For Example, Hurricane Dean. It would look exactly like it would in Mexico or something. you can also create you're own weather to import into FSX if you feel like flying through snow or something. it also gives you a map of the world with the weather on it...like a Weathermans Map. You Also get ASG which is Active Sky Graphics, it makes you're Sunset, Sunrise, Rain, Snow, Ice, Clouds, and even you're Airports runways and taxiways look 100% better. does a few more things but thats the basic stuff it does for you right there. EXCELLENT PROGRAM!! I Suggest you Download It. "

,eNuffSaid,2007-08-27T13:41Z,"Great uploads, Codee. Thank you very much for you lovely contributions for us flight simmers.

I salute you.
'nuff"
,Pochoclo,2007-08-27T13:46Z,"Great!!!

REQ: FS Repaint V2
        AFX v1.01
        Instant Scenery V1.02"
,UpandDown,2007-08-27T16:00Z,"Thanks for the upload Codee.
What is the difference between this upload and the upload from 9/6-2007 on TPB? Anything new?

The remark about 1 GB is not right on my PC, I only have 1 GB ram and Core 2 Duo processor+7800 GTX graphiccard with 512 Mb, and no difference in FPS with or without ASX activated. "
,mtjoeng,2007-08-28T19:47Z,"same idea here / doesnt really matter if you've got 1GB, textures get replaced, not added / and with same or better size.
clouds might be more complex, but thats where ASG value comes in = pretty and fast"
,mtjoeng,2007-08-28T19:48Z,btw which 'build' is this one?
,rfi999,2007-09-01T07:22Z,"Would you folks that downloaded this be kind to seed, please?"
,eNuffSaid,2007-09-14T09:55Z,"I'd like a seeder on this, too. Thanks very much."
,str1ker-,2007-09-19T15:53Z,"Yo, seriously, this is one of the best payware addons for FSX, and a whole load of people are stuck at 35-37%.

Please dude, re-seed, anything!

How do you contact this guy?"
,eNuffSaid,2007-09-24T12:11Z,"It's been downloaded 102 times. I guess we're just too late. :(

Not sure how to contact the original uploader. I still have this in my torrent client. Hopefully somebody will help out.

TIA."
,Irimi-Ai,2007-10-12T15:54Z,Will someone please seed this?  It was apparently only available for a very short time.
,sheeny,2007-10-24T09:04Z,"Hi Codec91691, I can only echo what the last person said, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE SEED. If you or anyone can take a look at the amount of Leechers this torrent has its unbelievable!. Were all sitting on 36% and all waiting for someone to seed this torrent.

Many thanks in advance"
,JackAss5,2007-11-15T11:20Z,Seed PLEASEEE!!! THX
,Poonta,2007-11-24T16:11Z,Please seed!
,slasherblazer,2007-12-07T12:05Z,Stuck at 36.3% please seed thanks!
,fantasma11123,2007-12-24T18:31Z,"Hi,  could somebody please seed this file?

53 peers 0 seeds"
,yeoldecaptain,2007-12-29T06:45Z,17 (21) Peers and no seeds and as with the users above -- halted at 36.2%  Surely someone out there can seed this so we can start the chain of sharing.
,davidlos,2007-12-31T19:43Z,Everyone stuck at 36.3% please seed thanks!
,gheeD,2008-01-20T12:54Z,"Ill suggest that you guys too download this torrent! http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3709575/FSX_-_HiFi_Flightware_-_Active_Sky_X It's same ASX but from better uploader, and many seeders! "
