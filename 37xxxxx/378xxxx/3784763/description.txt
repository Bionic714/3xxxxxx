During World War II, German intelligence spread its tentacles across the globe, operating throughout occupied and neutral Europe, and even as far afield as the United States. We'll see how German intelligence proved a formidable foe, and how in the end it was totally compromised from its center.  

This program provides an overview of German espionage from 1870 to 1945. The origins and development of the secret 'services' which Germany used to collect intelligence and to counter the activities of other countries are discussed. There are famous spies and unknown operatives involved in the dangerous and mundane activities of the professional "spy". A useful contrast to the fabulous world of Hollywood spies and secret agents, this documentary explores the unglamorous but nonetheless dangerous world of the espionage agent.
