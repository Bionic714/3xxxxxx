The Spiritworld DVD is no where else to find.
Anyway, may the Lord Y'HW'H bless you too."

In the 1980s, radio station KABC carried the ground-breaking radio program ""OPEN MIND"" with host Bill Jenkins.   The subject matter covered included UFOs, alternative energy, spirituality, ancient religions, and more.   Bill Jenkins later went on to host the classic film ""THE NAKED TRUTH"" with Jordan Maxwell, upon which the current internet hit ""ZEITGEIST"" is based.

The ""Open Mind"" radio programs have not been heard in many years ... until now.   We recently came into possession of a large collection of cassette tape recordings which had been made by a loyal listener, and had them digitized into MP3s.  This is a priceless collection of otherwise unattainable radio programs.   It is being freely shared here in an effort to make sure it is not lost to  history.

Though, it is nice that we have finally come to an age where people have the balls to discuss this stuff.  I don't recommend this to any member of organized religion because the lesson will not make sense to you. However, if you choose to watch these take it for what it is, a glimpse through a different window. You can always turn around and look through the one your used to if this one doesn't suit you. Thanks for the putting up the torrent!"
