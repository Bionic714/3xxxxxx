Brakuje tylko jednej czÃ?ï¿½Ã?ï¿½ci, aby dokoÃ?ï¿½czyÃ?ï¿½ nagranie - zabÃ?Â³jstwa. Jack i Atticus niechÃ?ï¿½tnie decydujÃ?ï¿½ siÃ?ï¿½ wkroczyÃ?ï¿½ na teren prywatny, gdzie, caÃ?ï¿½kiem moÃ?Â¼liwe, znajduje siÃ?ï¿½ ich przyszÃ?ï¿½a ofiara. BÃ?ï¿½dÃ?ï¿½c w Ã?ï¿½rodku cudzego terenu, stajÃ?ï¿½ siÃ?ï¿½ sami ofiarami. Tylko jeden z nich przeÃ?Â¼yÃ?ï¿½ i przeÃ?Â¼yÃ?ï¿½y taÃ?ï¿½my, bÃ?ï¿½dÃ?ï¿½ce dowodem tego, co przeszli.
