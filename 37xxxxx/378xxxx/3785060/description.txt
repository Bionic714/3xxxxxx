Here is the original uncompressed WAV file from the July 2007 DVD mixed by 01glitch.  This is audio only, captured at CD quality (16 bit / 44,100Hz).  

The DVD video ISO is still found at:  http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3761237/._._MINIMAL_TECHNO_GLITCH_DVD_VIDEO______VOL._I_._.


This mix will also be featured in the glitchpodcast002 on iTunes for September as an mp4 video for iPod.  That link is: http://www.itunes.com/podcast?id=262174635
(you may need to launch iTunes before using the link above)


Enjoy!
