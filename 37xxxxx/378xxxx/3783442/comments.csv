Thanks for this upload but when i unrar the archive it asks for the file xffm302.r00. I can not find this file anywhere in the torrent. What is going on?"
,wgb14,2007-08-25T02:52Z,The crack is not working. If i don't delete the licence file from the fluid directory it says that the trial has expired. If I will delete the licence file it says Licensing failure. Vertus Fluid Mask 3 has not been set up on your system please install fluid mask 3 using the set up program. Any help will be appreciated

,wgb14,2007-08-25T11:40Z,I got this part. The only problem is that the crack is not working... Any ideas?
,pipex_cop,2007-08-25T19:06Z,"CRACK:
It will work if you set the computer date back 2006 before starting the program.

You can then put the correct date back as you only need to do this the first time."
,pipex_cop,2007-08-25T22:35Z,"Actually, you have to set the date to 2006 before you do the install.

If you've already installed it, without setting the date back...just uninstall it (make sure the program folder is deleted because it contains the outdated serial), reboot...set the date to 2006, run the installation again, and follow the crack directions.

Then just to be safe, run the program once (inside of Photoshop etc), close it, and change the date back to normal, and it works fine."
,mohen,2007-08-28T11:28Z,"I get a strange problem, when I open from inside Photoshop it tell me my trial period is out, but when I open direct from programs it tell me I have an OK licens."
,Irida,2007-08-30T22:58Z,"Please please help! I can't unrar file, message coming up : "" you need to have following volume to continuous extraction.""
 What should I do?"
,Irida,2007-08-31T15:14Z,"I have same problem as WGB14, asking for xffm302.r00 volume. Please help I need this program badly.
Thanks"
,ailsa1208,2007-10-01T19:11Z,"Try NOT to remove ""fm3lic.txt"", keep it first and set your computer date back to 2006 then run the program.

I remove this file like the instruction tells me to ('cause I've installed a trial version before this) but I'll get this error message when I run the program: You didn't install fluid mask, please use the setup file to install it.

Then I put the txt file back, everything worked out perfectly."
,granny52,2007-10-28T05:31Z,"Finally, after trying everything I have got this working for CS3.
1. Install the program into Photoshop CS3>plugins>Adobe Photoshop Only folder.
2.Then copy the new exe file & lictxt file to that directory.
3.Also copy the lictxt file to C:\Windows directory.
4.Important...copy the new 8bf file to the plugins>filters directory NOT the ""plugins"" directory

I didn't need to change my date back to 2006 at all, doing it this way."
