Kung Pow
Spoof on Kung fu movies. Made with an original Kung-Fu movie, blue-screens and conspicuously terrible voice-overs. Look out for 'the chosen one' fighting with a cow & asking advice from the CNN Lion. (watch for things that do not belong in the movie like whales, titanic, aliens etc. - You might have to watch several times). Hilarious!
