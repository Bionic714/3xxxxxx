,Stader,2007-08-27T22:17Z,"the crack is in zip ""bs-ohw.r.18"""
,Zarni_,2007-08-27T22:22Z,Why would you want to DL 100mb rar when you can get the crack from the separate torrent i posted?
,slick7,2007-08-29T01:36Z,All I want to know is is this the real deal game....and when the crack is out could I use it
,CPH3r,2007-08-30T11:01Z,"Ok so I've lost it. At the end of the installation, BioShock wants to download the patch from the internet, but since it's not original it fails to do so. Which means I have to cancel the installation.

What do I have to do? Need some help :p"
,mijod,2007-08-30T16:24Z,Buy the f_cking game u loosers instead of complaining!
,Demios101,2007-09-03T19:49Z,the rar file contains a *.zix file which requires winzix to extract. winzix is spyware city. This torrent is hosed unless someone knows of another way to open *.zix files
