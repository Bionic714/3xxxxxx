#         BioShock lets you do the impossible as                        #
#         you explore a mysterious underwater city.                     #
#         When your plane crashes, you discover                         #
#         Rapture - an underwater Utopia torn apart                     #
#         by civil war. Caught between powerful                         #
#         forces and hunted down by genetically                         #
#         modified "splicers" and deadly security                       #
#         systems, you have to come to grips with                       #
#         a deadly, mysterious world filled with                        #
#         powerful technology and fascinating characters.               #
#         As little girls loot the dead, and                            #
#         biologically mutated citizens ambush you                      #
#         at every turn. Now you're trapped, caught                     #
#         in the middle of a genetic war that will                      #
#         challenge both your capacity to survive and                   #
#         your moral allegiance to your own humanity.                   #
#         Make meaningful and mature decisions that                     #
#         culminate in the grand question -                             #
#         do you exploit the innocent survivors                         #
#         of Rapture to save yourself - or risk                         #
#         all to become their savior?                                   #
