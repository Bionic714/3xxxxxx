,HeavensWrath,2007-09-08T03:28Z,"Thanks for the upload.

What do you use to convert your files?  I have a few movies I would like to convert to iPod format, but in long movies the sound is off.  (As in the sound is very late.)"
[T],crane_man,2007-09-14T04:09Z,"I use a program called easy avi to convert my movies to dvd format and then I use Nero the new Nero to convert to Ipod  but   Nero will really do all the work for you in one step but if you have a problem sanking your video and audio use easy avi first  and make a dvd then use Nero software to convert it to Ipod
I hope this helps"
[T],crane_man,2007-09-14T04:13Z,I have nero  in my torrents if you want it   and easy avi   came from a torrent also     just click on my user name and look for nero    but easy avi you will have to find out somewhere on pirate bay      good luck
,Ran4,2007-09-23T00:22Z,"Hah, so basically you transcode an AVI to DVD format, then you transcode it to mp4 format... Iee, the quality is crap, especially considering the file size.

Obviously crane man is a retard. Do not download this release, it's low quality."
,him187,2007-10-19T18:48Z,so is quality any good
[T],crane_man,2007-11-24T17:58Z,"the quality is the best you can make it  any more quality and it want work on the Ipod   so yes this is excellent

,Voo_Doo,2007-12-10T23:36Z,"Ran4 you have totally missed the point of the upload. It's meant to be put on an ipod, of coarse it'll be less than perfect on a pc screen. You call crane_man a retard? Be greatful that he's even doing all this work for little bitches like yourself to sit on your computer all day and all night to download for free"
