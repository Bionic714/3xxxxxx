,Caine.,2010-04-27T00:20Z,"Extract the rar archives on both CDs, it will show up an .bin and .cue, use daemon tools to emule them and install normally, around half of it, it will ask for CD2, emule it and then just let it complete the install, when It ask for a CD-Key, use
WEW6-LYJ6-CAZ4-XYG7-6255
PES8-GAX5-ZAS4-WUL4-3322
JYR3-BER8-LYM6-JED5-5662
Then, go to gamecopyworld.com and download the Caesar IV NoCd/Fixed Exe, go to Caesar IV installation directory, change the CaesarIV.exe file name and put the downloaded crack in the directory, then just play normally.And yes, it works 100%."
