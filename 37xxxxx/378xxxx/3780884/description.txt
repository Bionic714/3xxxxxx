Eleven year old David Wiseman is mad about cricket but no good at it. He has all the kit but none of the skill, and he's a laughing stock at school. So when a Jamaican family move in next door and build a cricket net in the back garden, David is in seventh heaven. But this is 1960's England, and when the neighbours start to make life difficult for the new arrivals, David's family are caught in the middle, and he has to choose between fitting in and standing up for the new friends who have turned his world upside down.
