It was very sad to read that the show was canceled after only one season. I cant help to wonder if the christian right and almost ultra conservative political climat are surpressing the intellectual and liberal democtaic parts of the American population even in the cultural arena."

He continues to annoy the conservative right by touching controversial issues. Keep up the good work! "

,illocon,2008-03-05T00:29Z,"This is a great quality set of vids, though as was stated earlier, the audio is out of sync by a second or two in episode 20.

apart from #20, the sound and video quality are clearly 10/10."
,ThePorpoise,2009-12-10T22:58Z,"If you download VLC media player, you can correct the audio syncing problem in episode 20 by pressing 
""j"" to delay the audio negatively and 
""k"" to delay the audio positvely. 

It works for all video as well! "

,zhool,2010-11-16T10:38Z,"v/fine dtv 
a/not normalized, some a little quiet so far

this is a slightly disparate collection.. 
thanx n gj to the uploader, but if any1 can rip the whole shabang with 100% rec vol and post a link here, that'd be swell :)"
,zhool,2010-11-16T11:25Z,* .. the whole shabang with 100% rec vol as avis@350-500mb ea ..
,zhool,2010-11-18T16:40Z,"- the audio kinda levels out but it doesnt go above 7.5 or 8/10 - 

as for the show - 

the first epsiode references the '76 film Network, clearly (to anyone who has seen the whole season) as both a renunciation and a warning.

My recommendation - unless you can't be kept from anything with a whiff of westwing (allison janney fans - ep17, wherein every gag from the previous 16 episodes is recompiled into the 30 sec before the title), or you thought 30rock could have used a further 20 minutes of long-winded 'i love you even though you believe in angels &/or are carrying some other guy's baby or whatever' speeches, give this one a miss. 

(in other words scratch that hi-qual rerip request)

,ecliptica83,2011-08-22T20:25Z,"Unfortunately episodes 3, 4, 5 and 6 won't play. I get the message: ""Cannot render the file"". Is there something I can do? The rest of the episodes although with some interruptions they play."
,olibritt,2012-04-27T12:09Z,"Thank you!! Great show!!
I've just download it and all episodes seem to work OK, but the small problem of ep20 (out of sinc).
Seeding now."
