  Â² Episode 3                                                         Â²
      Â° The seven remaining students compete in a challenge where they    Â°
        must entertain pre-school girls with their own rendition of
        Goldilocks and the Three Bears. The winner gets a private lesson
        with Mystery where they learn a top-secret attraction gambit.
        Mystery gives the students a lesson in how to build attraction
        with women by demonstrating higher value. The students learn
        that high value can be conveyed to women by telling interesting
        stories and by "negging" or playfully insulting the desired
        target. The guys go out to a bar to pick up girls in an
        elimination field test.
