War Made Easy reaches into the Orwellian memory hole to 
expose a 50-year pattern of government deception and 
media spin that has dragged the United States into one 
war after another from Vietnam to Iraq. Narrated by actor 
and activist Sean Penn, the film exhumes remarkable 
archival footage of official distortion and exaggeration 
from LBJ to George W. Bush, revealing in stunning detail 
how the American news media have uncritically disseminated 
the pro-war messages of successive presidential 
administrations.

War Made Easy gives special attention to parallels between 
the Vietnam war and the war in Iraq. Guided by media critic 
Norman SolomonÆs meticulous research and tough-minded 
analysis, the film presents disturbing examples of 
propaganda and media complicity from the present 
alongside rare footage of political leaders and leading 
journalists from the past, including Lyndon Johnson, 
Richard Nixon, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, dissident 
Senator Wayne Morse, and news correspondents Walter Cronkite 
and Morley Safer.

Norman SolomonÆs work has been praised by the Los Angeles 
Times as brutally persuasive and essential for those who 
would like greater context with their bitter morning coffee. 
This film now offers a chance to see that context on the 
screen.
