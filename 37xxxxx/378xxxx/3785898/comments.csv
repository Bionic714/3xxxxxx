,nheeeca,2009-01-05T19:33Z,look when I run the mojopac it asks me the name of the administrator and password. What do I do?
,eyeman53,2009-04-08T17:56Z,"Nice Up...However I have the same problem with the administrator and password. I can launch it without it,"
,johnnyfg,2009-04-21T01:27Z,"you need administrator rights to run the software. Therefore is not working so well on some public computers like in the library. But to bring your own winxp-user with you to your friends winxp-computer, this software is great! Feel free to add some portableapps to this, it will not hurt."
