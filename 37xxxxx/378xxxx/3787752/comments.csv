,greengorilla,2009-09-10T02:19Z,"this movie is terrible if you've read the book
but i cant complain about the quality or anything"
,jemoederkijktmee,2009-11-14T13:47Z,I don't want to read that stupid book soo i can watch the movie. Thanks! gmt.
,FuzzDog,2010-02-20T11:57Z,"The quality is fine but I don't like the movie, having already read the book. This movie is an alright suplement to the book but not a replacement. 

If you're studying this text for school READ THE BOOK. The movie is different in lots of ways and the book is better."
,texi400,2011-04-19T14:28Z,"This is the American adapted remake version by Harry Hook. If you've been lucky enough to see the original 1963 B&W version directed by Peter Brook, it's like comparing stale burnt popcorn with Foie Gras on fresh Baguette ('63 one being the pate). The greatest noticable difference is that the 1990 cast try far too hard to act the parts, whereas the young actors in the original film ARE the parts and express themselves naturally. The original is raw and honest. The newer version - plastic, contrived and controlling."

,devtrell,2012-03-01T03:38Z,"yeah great torrent, but it does not do the book justice at all, but if you havnt read the book, i guess its halfway decent, better movies out there."
