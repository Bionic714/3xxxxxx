,shannock,2008-01-08T22:45Z,"Apart from the sub-titles being permanently displayed ( a minor factor), well done. However, I have noticed that on this episode alone, when I try to convert the avi file to dvd, it crashes any conversion programme I have been using. Any thoughts?"
,RaTTyRaTT,2008-03-22T11:09Z,"3/4 the way through, there is a corrupted point, which stuffs the AVI from that point onwards.  I have tried to recover it using some video recover tools, but they all just truncate the file.   (SPOILER)  It's right after they remove the bullet from Sharpe's belly.
Didn't take much notice other than that, but i would guess that is why you are having failures to convert to DVD.  Either re-download another version or Lindoff41 will have to re-up it after doing the transcoding again."

,NoOneHuman,2008-10-30T13:18Z,"I have the same problem, it only convert about 55% and then it stop and shuts down the converter. I am swedish and like that there are english subtitles, and can't find anyone else who has it.

Please Lindoff41, are you able to fix this? I have all the others and I have Sharpes sword without sub, but I would like to have the on with subtitles."
