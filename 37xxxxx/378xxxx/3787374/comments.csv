,melfice26,2007-08-29T23:31Z,"a ""thank you"" would be nice..."
,melfice26,2007-08-29T23:36Z,"It's a custom dvd... so there is no IMDB link for this, but if you find one... please don't hesitate to post it yourself!
And all the other links you're nagging about...
They're my other uploads, and I'm proud of them, and if they bother you...just scroll down!"
