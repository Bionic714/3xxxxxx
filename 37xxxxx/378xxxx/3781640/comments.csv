I'm thinking I might come up with a new updated version in December with more songs, if you guys have comments, suggestions, requests for songs for me to find, please comment, thanks ;)"

I also have tricky disco - discotronic and probably some of the others if you want me to email them to you or something...  let me know."
,qwertyo,2007-09-10T22:02Z,"yeah, mindhacker, if you have any songs that I don't have on the list, it would be great if you can email/torrent it to me. Oh, and btw, I have Raver's Fantasy in the torrent, just download it first or something if you need it now. I'll be sure to look around for the songs you requested"
,mindhacker,2007-09-13T02:46Z,"You know... turns out I did download Ravers Fantasy early on. Well then. Thanks.

Heres about a dozen that I have / found. Keep up the good work!
