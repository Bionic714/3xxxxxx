,el_segundo,2007-08-22T19:12Z,DVD conversion from the best AVI file so far found. No subs at all despite what it says above (sorry misleading info). Very good picture & sound quality. Not a cam. Please seed when complete as I can't leave this running for too long. Once a good couple of dozen have downloaded it'll be up to you guys to keep this thing alive.
