I got this from youtube and reencoded it (with little to no quality loss) so the quality isn't a dvd-rip. Its VERY watchable though. Standalone DivX player compatible.  I can't find much about it online.

I'm a skeptic towards certain things, but do you ever notice that some of these skeptics, when they can't explain something, just resort to just calling someone a downright liar?  Then there are people that are the "professional skeptics".  I don't need to have a plaque to show that I don't believe a damn thing and come up with the stupidest explanations for things because I don't want to believe the truth because I don't understand it.

Then you have the psycho story tellers....
