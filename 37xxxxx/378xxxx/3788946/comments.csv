,TheProfet,2007-08-31T09:56Z,"This was uploaded yesterday & 170 people or computers or aliens have downloaded this file but there are only 1 comment to this. So it has to mean that this is a good copy hence the watermark & time that ektacrome is talking about.
Where are the seeders & leechers. Do u all just disconnect after ur download is complete?
U have been in the position of waiting ages for a download & just want somebody with good connection to join that can seed u the app or movie but u dont do it urself. Shame on U.

Now. Can someone please rejoin & seed this torrent. Cause the Piratebay info on Seeders & Leechers have always been a lie.. 432 Seeders & 648 Leechers..eum, but where are they???!!!!"

,alarik_2,2007-09-01T14:58Z,"I wouldn't call it a ""good copy"" when it has  watermark & time line.

When you ad so much info about the film ""malkaviano007"" don't you think you could tell people openly that the movie is marked and spare people some grief? ;-)"
,john111111111111111111111,2007-09-01T15:22Z,"this is a good quality upload. the word universal is written at the top and there is a stopwatch thing along the bottom, but it doesn't detract from the movie at all. 

However i dont understand how if bourne is the no1 most wanted criminal he can just fly in and out of countries (esp USA) with noone noticing and no disguise. Also whenever he is blown up or has a high impact car crash he just gets up and brushes himself down and walks away. This gives the movie a cartoon like character like Tom and Jerry."
,jonasbaud,2007-09-04T23:17Z,"malkaviano007 started his comments with:

The Bourne Ultimatum 2007 DVDScreener Proper

Screener means time line and watermark is added (you all know that), so why flame malkaviano007?

Don't know about quality and stuff of this copy. I used http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3791820/The.Bourne.Ultimatum.AC3.Dolby_5.1(6chnls).DivX-LTT
That one has got no watermarks or time lines or whatsoever. Enjoy"
