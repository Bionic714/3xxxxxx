,Shinstro,2007-08-28T19:13Z,Can you turn the subs off?
,jgabriel,2007-08-31T13:42Z,"No, if the subs are hardcoded in an avi file, they can't be turned off. 

Bolinat would have been wiser to either pack the subs as a separate .srt file, or package the film in a .mkv (matroska) container, where the subs can be made optional.

The only I can think of to hardcode subs in an avi file is because some commercial DivX players don't accept external subs. Perhaps Bolinat made this file with that audience mind.
