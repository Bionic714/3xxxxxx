Wow! I loved the homeworld pc games and hard sci fi so this is a dream come true... did you know they re released the books last year?"
,dogturd,2007-08-29T20:20Z,"They released some kind of sequel book, I have it, it's called ""Spacecraft 2100 to 2200 ad""and I I was not impressed at all, it was just the old book done in computer graphics (looks like armature 3dsmax) with a few new ships added."
,dogturd,2007-08-29T22:25Z,"yeah I am going to start scanning in the other books, thanks"

Holy shit!!

I read these books in my local library almost thirty years ago. Since someone stole them, I've been looking for them from online and antiquaries all around the country. Every time I saw them online, someone had already bought them.

You truly are an internet Superhero!"
