He changed his name after he was deported from the U.S., but his 'teachings' are the same - dangerous and insane."

This one called HeyNonny... writes as if they are certain about these events, but perhaps only demonstrate a closed mind. or perhaps they really do know, & these things did happen.  I don't think it matters, & won't give much energy to such drama.  I'm only interested in the techniques / experiments of personal growth, suggested by Osho in his rambling stream-of-consiousness writings. bless it all."
