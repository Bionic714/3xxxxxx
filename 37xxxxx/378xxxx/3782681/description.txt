into the night. A doctor who is devoured by demons wearing New Orleans PD badges. 
Demons who work for someone--or something--that?s descended on the Big Easy 
and doesn't give a damn who Hellstorm or his father is. Something that's 
harvesting body parts in a furious race toward unspeakable purposes. This is
