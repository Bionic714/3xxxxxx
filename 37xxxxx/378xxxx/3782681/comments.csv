,zelenka,2007-10-23T08:01Z,"Ey Lee man! Shut YOUR Gobb!!! It clearly say that there has recently been added a HALO related Grafic Novel. And Tin man, good question. Why would you only post a quarter of a book?! And WHY do I have to download close to 2 gigg. of other material if I only want the HALO related stuff???!!! Anywho, I would appreciate if someone would post the full Grafic Novel on this site."
