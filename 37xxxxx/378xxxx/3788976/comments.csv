God it's annoying.

Even with help from Cruz9131 (thanks dude) I still cant make it work completely.

GOD - don't create a torrent with this quality.
Fix it before upload..."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_Queen:_A_Tribute_to_Queen

that will bring you to a page that correctly lists the songs on the album and the artist who preformed it. The torrent is complete but everything is mixed up and some songs dont have the artist name, or only include part of it"
