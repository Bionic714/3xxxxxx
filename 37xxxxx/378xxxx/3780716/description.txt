Review		Mature, powerful drama about a feisty, self-destructive 
                screenwriter (Bogart) who has an affair with starlet Grahame while 
                trying to clear himself of a murder rap. Excellent performances in 
                this study of two turbulent characters set against realistic and 
                cynical Hollywood backdrop. Written by Andrew Solt. (Review from 
                'Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide')

		Although not as well known as his other work, Bogart's performance 
                in this film is considered by many critics to be among his finest 
                and the film's reputation itself has grown over time along with 
                Ray's. The film is now considered a classic film noir, as evidenced 
                by its inclusion on the Time Magazine All-Time 	100 List. (From 
                'Wikipedia')
