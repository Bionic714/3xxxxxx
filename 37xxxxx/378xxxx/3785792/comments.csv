,Zoracic,2007-09-13T09:43Z,"And? Which version are you using? Have you tried the older version with the old serial? http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3664558

Both work fine for me."

,fabribek,2008-01-31T23:31Z,"Thanks for the registry information Zoracic!

I installed the 2.5.4.544 version and my registry looks different from what you have listed.

If anyone is going to install VideoRedo for the first time, I would suggest you use the Trial-Reset utility Zoracic referred to in his post above, to take a before picture of the Armadillo entries in your registry. This way you have something to compare to *IF* you run into any trouble further down the road.

One thing I did notice though is that certain registry keys had a date next to them in the Trial-Reset utility. I am assuming that is the date of install. That may be another pointer to which keys need to be looked at closely.

PS>Zoracic, how do you include a link in the comments? Last time I tried I got ""database error""...

Peace!"
