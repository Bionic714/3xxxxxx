,mnemesis,2007-12-20T02:13Z,Wtf r u talking damn retard !!!! This IS Norton Ghost  !!!!
,Jeronimoo,2008-02-10T22:06Z,"Why would you use this instead of Norton Ghost 12? 

Not saying Norton Ghost 2003 is inferior per se, but it is older... "
,mnemesis,2008-02-15T10:25Z,Ya it is old. But for me it is simplest and fastest ghost. Btw it eat much less memory than new ghosts.
,konstnaki,2008-04-02T00:20Z,I think you need Norton Ghost 2003 build 775
[T],trackers,2008-06-26T12:43Z,This is Norton.Ghost.2003.793
,the_epoch,2008-11-30T06:50Z,"This is NOT Norton Ghost 2003.
This is Adobe Reader 5.0.5.

Try Symantec_Norton_Ghost_2003_by_Tygroso instead:

,Focus88,2009-03-08T13:07Z,"Thank you very much for sharing this one! Norton Ghost 14.0 is worse: I tried to create recovery disk with it and it did not work. I even printed out the freakig manual to understad it. Oh, well. Now I got the 2003! Me very happy!"
,griffinmills,2009-09-14T11:18Z,Not Acrobat 5.5 at all.  Works just fine.
,Umpie,2011-03-23T14:51Z,"Stop nagging.
THIS IS NORTON GHOST 2003
It is the complete Nero-Disk image of the CD,
and that CD contains also Actrobat reader 5.

Don't download the torrent from Tygroso, that is an older incomplete version. "
,ezone36,2011-06-08T23:34Z,"Damn but I hate being BOTH inexperienced and dumb, but that seems to be the way it is. I just downloaded this Norton Ghost 2003 IMAGE, and now I don't know what to do with it.

Could someone help this poor old soul with some information as to how I get from this image file to an executable file or program? Thanks.
EZONE36"
,shabes,2011-08-10T14:44Z,MOTHERFUCKER! its not ghost peace of shit uploader
,SnowmanDK,2012-02-02T12:35Z,"HEY KIDS!!!
Before complaining, how about using the file in a correct manner?
It IS Norton Ghost on a Nero Image file packed into a rar archive.
Burn it or mount it with DaemonTools..."
