Description
================
There is something palpable about the excitement of hearing for the first time 
a milestone piece of music, even over twenty years after it was first recorded. 
As I understand it, "Thoughts of War" is the first official release by Mark 
Shreeve. That alone would make it worth coveting for his fans, but beyond that 
it is a damn fine album. Try as current artists may, including Shreeve himself, 
to duplicate the analog synthesizer sound of the 1970s, there is a spirit to 
the original recordings from that era that cannot be copied. This is the genuine 
article, and it is a wonderful treasure.
The album is divided into four long electronic excursions. 
"Thoughts of War - Part One" is a full-blown sequencer attack that impresses as 
much today as it must have then. There are two distinct movements within the 15-
minute song, titled "Escalation" and "Cold Emotion." The latter takes the same 
sequencer pattern, strips away the surrounding electronics, and adds some heavy 
modulation to make the music sound colder to fit the mood. This is a great 
thematic work, incredible storytelling without words. "Nightmare of Reality" 
should appeal greatly to fans of early 1970s Klaus Schulze. "Dream Sequence" is 
fascinating to listen to as it unfolds. Largely a mood piece, it takes a 
surprising, more upbeat turn toward the end. It's clear that Shreeve was painting a picture with this music, the soundtrack to a movie of his imagination. It is energetic but moody, with a sense of foreboding.
"Thoughts of War" has all the right elements in the right combinations - great sounds, great emotion, thoughtful compositions, all arranged in a way that is familiar yet thoroughly original. Surprisingly, it is currently only available as a limited edition of 300 copies. If they sell out, hopefully plans will be made for a second reissue of more copies to follow.
