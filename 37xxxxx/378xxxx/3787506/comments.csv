I have a PS1 emulator (and all the bios) but it doesn't seem to work, can anyone help?"
,Eddyeleven,2007-10-04T23:36Z,this is a computer game and if you still want to play it read the txt document
,Amyfers,2007-10-15T21:15Z,"Hmm I have no rewritable disks....

,hara18,2007-10-17T17:42Z,"Hey EddyEleven.
Thanks for uploading this :)
Uhm. i got a question tho.
 Im used to people calling me a geek, but when it comes to DAEMON TOOLS, im a little off.. and the link you put in the ""Read me first"" -file, is invalid.. so, are there any way you might be able to assist me step-by-step after the DEAMON-part of the installation? :) ..or anyone else, for the matter >_> Thanks."
,Eddyeleven,2007-11-18T18:16Z,"to hara18:
you could try using PowerISO a nifty program you can get by using the Trial version at: http://www.poweriso.com/download.htm or get the full installation off here at PirateBay. what you do after you have installed the program is open power iso, open the .daa file and on the toolbar you'll see mount. click on it and scroll down to set number of drives (click 1 drive). what this does is make a seperate digital drive on your computer using the hard drive but it will act like a cd drive. now click mount again and you'll see a ""Drive F"" or some other drive letter, go to it and then you'll see mount image. do that. now. go to ""My Computer"" and click on the drive (it will say the file name beside it). Presto, you'll enter the setup. do the same after you have installed the game to play it. you might worry about taking the drive off but all you have to do is unmount the image file and then set number of drives to Zero.

,brent_reddish,2008-12-30T03:13Z,Screw Power Iso. You should use Alcohol 120% Works Much Better.
,brent_reddish,2008-12-30T03:15Z,I really wish that there were more seeds.
,simpson_d,2009-02-18T05:34Z,THIS IS CRAP!!! IT DOESN'T WORK!!!
,Starlitice,2009-03-25T18:12Z,"Hi!
I can't make it work, I don't know what I'm doing wrong but it keeps asking me to insert the CD even if i mounted the gae on Power Iso (and I bet I'm doing it wrong :P)
Can anybody help me, please?"
,RaySoul,2011-04-27T00:03Z,"Hey guys, use PowerIso like Eddy said and it should work, it did for me.

Just a prob, some of the balls aren't colored right. The elemental transparent ones are all black and really hard to tell one from the other.

The rest of the colors of eveything else is fine so, what's wrong?  Is this fixed if I put it in windowed mode or so?  If so, how do I do that  :x

Thanks in advance"
,RaySoul,2011-04-27T00:50Z,"For those with probs with ball colors, press F5 during game and choose the middle option that doesnt say ""HighColor"" something like that.

Thanks a lot for this upload Eddy"
,petran79,2012-04-13T18:39Z,"hallo, I have Windows XP. When I click on setup.exe it gives me an error that file can not be found. Probably because it is 16-bit installer.

I tried compatibility settings but it makes no difference."
