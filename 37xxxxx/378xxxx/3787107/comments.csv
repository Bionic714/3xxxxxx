And btw: BitComet, BitLord and that gang of torrent clients suck! They leech so bad I put users I spot with those clients in my IP ban list."
,bobsnot,2007-09-04T04:48Z,cn i format to dvd to burn to watch on 52 inch
,StikkyB,2007-09-04T11:39Z,"bobsnot : Yes you can. I put all the movies i download onto DVD and watch them on t.v.
I think the only ones you cant convert back to DVD are those which you need to download that 3w player to watch on ur p.c.

,DudeRisk,2007-09-06T15:03Z,Stop doing the idiot chain letter SPAMMING like on YouTube. Thanks Stikky =]
,DudeRisk,2007-09-06T17:44Z,"I had some problems with the audio too.. You just need to download some codec  called ""AC3 Filter""

Here is the link: http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?groupname=ac3filter&filename=ac3filter_1_46.exe&use_mirror=belnet

No spyware, adware, virus or any kind of dangerous EXE.

If you don't trust me.. Just have no audio."
