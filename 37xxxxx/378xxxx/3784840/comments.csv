Hell, I just needed something to say, and it's not like I can take credit for anything in this file.  I didn't make the crack, didn't make the patch, and I certainly didn't make the game.  Maybe the image, but not the game.  All I'm responsible for is bringing this pack together."
,samoerai3000,2007-08-27T00:14Z,"hear hear mate, good upload"
,dmneoblade,2007-09-08T06:43Z,"U bought this game for USD $5. Convinced another friend to grab it as well.
This game is deceptively good. I love playing it."
,serodon,2007-09-28T20:14Z,seed please.
,sayres,2007-11-14T07:00Z,Back seeding after a couple of months without net.  It's interesting seeing this thing take a life of it's own.  Currently seeing 5 others who are seeding.
,DSLLL,2007-11-15T17:05Z,"Thank you Sayres.

I actually do buy most of the things I KEEP.   For whatever little that is worth.

When I dled this, and tried alcohol, I got a ""not recognized format"" error.

I will try it again.

,sayres,2007-12-19T05:27Z,"Agreed.  It seems to be the way I try out most of my games nowadays.  Download something from here, then try it out.  If it's good, I seed and buy my own copy.   I hate to say it, but most demos I can find don't give me a good enough look at the game for me to see if I'd be willing to shell out my own cash for it.

Speaking of which, I retried installing my copy and it worked just fine using Alcohol 120.  Might want to try getting BitTorrent 6.0  I love the error checking of this one as it will kill corrupted pieces during the download."
,nacho666,2008-03-20T11:04Z,Downloading... 197days and 17hours... can't wait. (Lol!)
,gianijoker007,2008-05-10T02:00Z,"i didnt think someone would seed this but guess what?im downloading:)

tnx uploader:)"
,Tehmulletman,2008-09-25T10:03Z,downloading now i'll seed it if its worth it =)
,jokke149,2009-01-04T06:14Z,"dude, i bought this game a while ago... but  my cd is fucked so now i gotta dl it :P"
,Hustaryin,2009-02-06T02:31Z,"Got the demo along with Stronghold Crusader, played it more that Crusader.  Dling this now, I will post back soon."
,Hustaryin,2009-02-09T18:02Z,"Ok took awhile to dl but here it is:
1: Download (duh) might take a while do to little seeders(SEED!!)
2: Open with WinRAR(or like program) and extract to desktop
3: Run Demon Tools(or like program) and mount the MDS file.
If you did the above steps right you should have the install screen up now.  If not repeat or Start-Run-___(whatever drive you have the MDS file mounted on)
4: After the install is finished you can play it or continue and patch it.
5: to patch just open the 'patch' file with WinRAR and run the EXE.
6: Then crack it by placing the cracked EXE(in the 'crack' WinRAR file over the EXE that the game already has.

If you have done the above steps right, well then good luck and happy alien hunting.  If not, then try it differently it might work.
NOTE!!!: if you do try things on your own make sure to make a backup file just in case you screw up you original file!!"
,xxxstefnexxx,2009-03-23T00:44Z,Needs more seeders.
