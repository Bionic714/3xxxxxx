Came across this file on another tracker. (respect! to the orig. uploader)
It, supposedly, shows how you can convert your car engine to run on water instead of gasoline.

This document claims that:

- Run your car entirely on normal water
- Drive up to 100km on one litre of water
- More horse powers from your engine on water than from conventional gasoline
- Exhausts only water vapour and oxygen


I have no mechanical skills whatsoever to attempt this myself. But someone else might have. Would sure like to know if anyone succeeds in this.


The reason why I think this document could be credible is because they are not trying to sell you anything. They are even putting out the tech anonymously. 
I can't see what they would have to gain from this, other than their grandchildren being able to breathe the air in Earth's atmosphere when they grow up...
