Future rips will be lower in quality, unfortunately. I got DirecTV, no more HD-DVR with firewire output. The best I can do next is s-video quality until further exploits are found on my HR20-700. I will concentrate on PSU games for fans out here. Possibly some NFL games also. I have lots of friends overseas who are dying to see some American Football action! Stay tune for my releases!

WE ARE ... PENN STATE!

cheers,
