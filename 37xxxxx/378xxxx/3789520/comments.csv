,mycarrion2,2007-08-31T07:39Z,"""Kanye you done it again!!""

I don't think he'll see this.  In case he does...

You're a fucking useless, gay, sweater-wearing, gerbil-faced assmonkey twat that has single-handedly killed hip hop.  Great job.  Smoke me."
,harbones,2007-08-31T15:54Z,please buy this album.. if kanye sells more albums than 50. then 50 will quit:D that is presumably not going to happend but i have hope...

,Makkaranaama,2007-09-01T14:00Z,"Crappy torrent. Bad naming and the ""clean"" version sucks.

No offense but this sucks. And why is it zip!? What's the point in that!? Reducing the sound quality?

Phaah.. I don't recommend."
,pitamacpro,2007-09-01T15:46Z,Great album!
,Piraten.mosh,2007-09-01T19:47Z,"don't be so cheap and skip seed after download!

,ville866,2007-09-03T16:07Z,Please buy this album!
,TSOAJC,2007-09-05T22:56Z,"Hi,

50 Cent has cashed in JT's fame in the single released and it's so poor anyway.  Kanye will sell more albums 50 will quit hopefully and Hip Hop is saved. Whooo Go Kanye !"
,TSOAJC,2007-09-05T23:02Z,"P.S.

mycarrion2. sounds to me like you are part of the reason it died.  Kanye is innovative 50 is derivative, another gansta who fell off after the first album."
