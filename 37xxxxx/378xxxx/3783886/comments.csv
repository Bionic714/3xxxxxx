I can't speek english very well, so I can't explain you how to mount the file. but I have here some images that explain how to find the image file:

when you do this you should found the image file. so, duble click on it and it will apear on the list of images. you just need to mount it on the drives that apears on the bottom of the screen.

I can't explain better. if you want more explains just wait for another user....."

Connection refused, please check your internet connection and any firewall software you may have.

Do you know how to solve the problem and doing the registration.

Thanks"
