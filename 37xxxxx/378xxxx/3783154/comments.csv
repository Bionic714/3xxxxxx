,frenchie,2009-03-09T20:59Z,"The install and program works just fine!

Remeber, this is the DOS-version of TP. Unpack the rar in your dedicated install directory. Run the INSTALL.EXE and select which drive to install on (read how to alter values at the bottom of the screen).

Once installed, start the enviroment in a DOS-window by running \TP\BIN\TURBO-shortcut. Since this is a DOS-shortcut you can also adjust the shortcut itself to run as a window or full-screen session.

Please mind your language!

I've installed this package first under dosemu on Ubuntu and then under Win7.

Both installations worked perfectly well, so obviously you've missed something. Maybe you should forget programming with TP all together?

Thanks myszozord for this important contribution to computer history. Trying to download this package the ""legal"" way is nothing but a PITA. The TPB way is, as always, the easiest way to go."
