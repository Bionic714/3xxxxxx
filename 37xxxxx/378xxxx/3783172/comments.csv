[V],Subzero!,2007-09-08T22:22Z,"run GPxPatch.exe and de-activate some options and try again, or may another NO.CD.exe file will help you guys, i really dont know what i can do for you people... it works fine overhere . a friend of mine said aswell it crash sometimes, and sometimes not, really a weird thing!"
[V],Subzero!,2007-09-08T22:23Z,"
From PC lock-ups to illegal operations, Internet Explorer crashes,
slow-downs, and other frustrations, many problems purely and
simply come down to what is running in the background on your
PC and currently demanding attention by the computer.

The trick to having a PC that runs smoothly is to know which background
tasks are essential, which are not, and which only need to run sometimes.
By managing these processes more intelligently your system can free up
more memory, run more reliably and avoid crashes and lock ups."
