,uberliege,2008-01-16T22:50Z,Avoid this unless you need the rarities. 128k bitrate  MP3 within.
,mac_ftw,2008-02-23T04:00Z,fucking brilliant! thank you! oh my gawd! thank you!
,Sprit_Shaman,2008-02-28T17:02Z,"I don't mind 128 bitrates, as a casual listener of music it really doesn't matter.

Smaller bitrates result in smaller d/l for people with lesser connections. I Cut them all down to 40 bitrate mp3pro to shave size anyway, and I honestly enjoy the music as much as well as stick 14000+ songs on my mp3 player.

Thanx for the torrent, been looking for a collection like this for a friend. I reallt appreciate everything everyone does for this site...."
