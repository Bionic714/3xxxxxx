,findermix,2007-09-02T16:35Z,"Not tested in CS3, work in CS2(8)"
,badasskker,2008-04-09T19:28Z,"It works on Mac Intel with CS3 also. You need to find the Photoshop CS3 application file on your hard drive and do a Get Info on it. Once the Get Info window appears, you'll see a checkbox that reads, ""Open using Rosetta."" Check that checkbox and close the window. Run CS3 and it'll be running in Rosetta. Please know that applications running in the Rosetta Emulation mode are noticably slower than those same applications running natively in Universal mode. But the application suxs, I deleted in instantly."
