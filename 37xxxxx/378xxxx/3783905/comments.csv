Q:* BUT SHE'S HALF-BERSERK. OR MORE THAN HALF.

A:* No. Nothing. She was needed at that time. Hasya or anybody else would not have tackled the problems that she managed to tackle. She was continuously in the courts, continuously fighting with the politicians, continuously fighting with the Oregonians, continuously facing all the hostility -- and she managed it perfectly well.

Q:* BUT SHE PROVOKED A LOT OF IT TO.

A:* It is not really the case -- provocation came from the other side. No minority ever provokes, but every minority is always condemned. Such a small minority of five thousand people -- do you think any logic in it to provoke hostility? We wanted all friendship, but it was natural on the part of Oregonians to be hostile. Everybody is hostile to the newcomers, to the strangers -- and we are certainly very much strangers.
And somebody like Sheela was absolutely needed. So I did not stop her; I let her do till I saw that the commune is established -- now there is no need for anybody to fight. I have changed the whole group. I have put all the Americans in all the higher posts, while with Sheela there were all non-Americans on the higher posts. Now this is a second phase for the commune, because four years is enough -- Oregonians have understood one thing, that we are going to be here.
In the beginning they were hoping that they will throw us out; at that time Sheela was absolutely essential and she did well, and the commune will always be grateful for it. And everything illegal that she did, Oregon state government, Wasco county, attorney general -- everybody provoked her, because they were doing illegal acts against us.
It is a very natural thing: you cannot fight when people are doing who have power and who have majority, and they are doing illegal acts against you.... And they have courts in their hands. Then she started being illegal. That's how she turned more and more into a politician. That was a natural course. It was to happen.
If you deal with politicians you cannot remain non-political. You have to learn in the same ways same language, same strategies -- and she learned and she did exactly what they were doing.

Q:* SOMETIMES SHE DID A BIT MORE THAN WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

A:* Perhaps. It will be revealed soon, when Sheela is exposed with her, all the politicians and all the people who provoked her will also be exposed. That is my fear, that politicians, the police, FBI, CBI, they may like to make a deal with Sheela that, ""We will protect you and we give you immunity. And you just dump all the crimes on innocent sannyasins."" So they can destroy the commune.
For four times they had appointments with me and for four times they canceled. In fact they should have asked for an appointment with me, in the very beginning -- that was the first thing to do, because I have announced all the crimes against Sheela.
But they did not want to face me. And four times they accepted and they went on, at the last moment they will cancel. Then I told them, ""Then I am going to call a press conference and make it clear that you cannot make a deal with the criminals.""
The reason is that these are the peoples who did provoke Sheela to do things, because they were doing the same things, our phones were tapped by INS -- Sheela learned the same strategy from them: she started tapping the phones here. So when Sheela is exposed, INS is going to be exposed with her. From where she learned and why? -- it was just a self-defense measure.
In Antelope we had the majority; still we were not interested in making the government. We have no interest in politics, but for small permits they will not give. Knowing perfectly well that you are a minority and you are refusing legal permits which are absolutely justified, to the majority, you are provoking the majority."
