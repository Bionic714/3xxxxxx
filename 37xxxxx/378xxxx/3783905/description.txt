Q:*... IS WHY YOU DIDN'T ACT WITH SHEELA. WHY YOU LET HER BECOME YOUR SECRETARY? -- SOMEBODY WITH VERY OBVIOUS LIMITATIONS AS WELL AS STRENGTHS.

A:* It is my own insight that is decisive. It is not a question of thinking pros and cons. It is my insight and Sheela served her purpose perfectly well. Now she was going beyond it.

Q:* WHY NOT STOP HER BEFORE SHE GOES BEYOND IT?

A:* I stopped it. I stopped her in the right time.
