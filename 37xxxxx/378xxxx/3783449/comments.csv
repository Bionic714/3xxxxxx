,aussiehero81,2007-08-26T14:25Z,"Great that you guys seed - thanks - I'll try to stay on line myself too:)

Hehe - this album is a digital release only, so it is actually bought from iTunes, recorded with audacity and converted to mp3 - I thought it was too bad that this album was not available ANYWHERE in mp3 format;)

Enjoy!"
