,spidermancmh,2007-09-30T02:03Z,"Question: I tried burning this disc multiple times, several different ways but I always get the same problem.  It takes forever to load in all dvd players, and it just randomly skips sometimes and never in the same place twice.  I'll be 15 mins. into episode four and it will zap me back to the first 30 seconds of episode 2.  Any ideas?"
,swullholm,2007-12-02T00:18Z,"I have kind of the same problem, I tried ectract one of the rar files and then mount it with deamon tools (this way worked with the other two dics by the same uploader) but when I start a episode thereÂ´s a warning sign saying that thereÂ´s a problem and the ""cd"" may be scratched. Is there someone that has made it work, and how?
