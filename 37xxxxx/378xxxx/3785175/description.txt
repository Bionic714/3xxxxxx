To whomever caps the HDTV version, 350megs is an acceptable size for 720x400 and the length. Unless you're overly concerned about preserving quality then ignore my pleas. You can go with a lower bitrate and also if you have the computing power you can get rid of uppin the strength of the deinterlacing or get rid of jaggies by doing something like .lanczosresize(1480,800).sangnom().turnright().sangnom().turnleft().lanczosresize(720,400)

Dunno ignore me or give it a try, thanks anyway ^_^
