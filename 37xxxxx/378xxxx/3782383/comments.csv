,TheWixster,2008-03-11T09:38Z,"Indeed, where be this authorization?"
,myfriendgoo,2008-04-12T05:57Z,Don't download this. All locked up.
,lukasty,2008-12-06T06:51Z,"Seriously, it is an audible.com purchase and requires password to authorize the comp on itunes. Anyone know how to work around this?"
,jabrwky,2009-02-10T16:23Z,"For Krissakes people, please SEEED these .aa files.  The freakin' things are all dead.  I'll convert 'em an re-up IF I can only get 'em.
They're highly compressed, but there are work-arounds for username, password."
,Newuser80,2009-12-26T23:54Z,"These files are .m4b files that require authorization from itunes due to DRM protection.  It is near impossible to rip these files and play them without having the authorization password, which isn't available.  I tried all sorts of illegal software and couldn't strip the DRM from the files.  I gave up and will wait for another torrent with a format you can listen to."
