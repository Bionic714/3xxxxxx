for details check file list.

I really love to share my stuff with you, especially Hanns Eisler, who was so much more than a leading composer of the 20eth century alone.

BUT PLEASE TAKE CARE THAT AT LEAST 1 SEEDER REMAINS WHEN YOU STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I don't have very much time and it takes a few hours to make the torrent with scanning the booklets.
And after a while I have to stop seeding by myself, because I need the internet connection and my disc space.
Most of my torrents are for a smaller audience, but there is always someone who wants it, so please don't let it die too soon.
