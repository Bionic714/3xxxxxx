,DarthBubba,2007-08-30T14:26Z,This is NOT an .AVI file.  It is an .mp4 file!  Make sure you have the right CoDec or player available.
,godarium,2007-08-30T15:25Z,you can read it with windows media and  nero show time
,DarthBubba,2007-08-31T07:55Z,"WMP can't read it without the proper CoDec.
Nero Showtime is obviously a proper player.
Had you labeled the movie properly, I wouldn't have wasted two days downloading it for the second time.  I was hoping that this "".AVI"" file was a better copy than what I already had: an .mp4 version."
