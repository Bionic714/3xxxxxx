If you want to try something keep a notepad w/ your cigs and jot the time 4 each cig. It helps a lot by exercising your will power and helps u bcome aware. I noticed that alone I decreased my smoking rate. I went from 1 cig every half hr to almost 1 every 2 hrs in first month and it really didn't bother me. A great tool and its free.
