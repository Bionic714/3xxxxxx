Ok, here it is. I am to understand this is not the 100% original release. This was done as a screener for people to watch and offer up thoughts. This is a full complete movie. I guess times have changed since the original and people are far to impatient for character development because this is the wham bam thank you mame version of Halloween much like the Dawn Of The Dead remake. I have watched it one time, and plan on seeing in the theater opening day. I like a lot about it but at the same time, Michael loses a lot of what made him scary. As an old fan I am of course gonna have my own opinion but to someone new to the Halloween series I think this will gain some new fans and bring back some old ones. Ok ROB... props... You had a hard talk ahead of you when you did this and you should get credit for doing a good job.
