,findermix,2007-08-24T19:42Z,"Download yet, now yes"
,gapen,2007-08-29T12:26Z,Am i stupid or what? How does the crack work?
,webfilippos,2008-02-25T22:19Z,"Obviously the directory inside the torrent is backwards. U have to go inside the folder and set up the softare. Then the typical copy-paste of the .exe to the Programs Directory.
WIth the crack u get the right to do long searches. Love this software, u can actually install it on an external drive + it found 80% of my deleted files in 20sec!"
,grami75,2009-04-09T19:52Z,"This program is a must, I accidently cleared my 550 gig external hdd when i tried to partition one half to mac os x. I lost 150 gig of music, movies and tv shows, this little program got me about 90% of it back, in the folders it used to be in. Nothing short of amazing. Cheers dubago771 u are my hero."
