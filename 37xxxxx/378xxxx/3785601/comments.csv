,rapthor666,2007-08-27T04:44Z,Thnxs m8 for all the hard work on this and the other albums
,Tech-Noir,2007-08-27T06:33Z,"No problem. ;)

Let me know how you like it if you want. :)"
,guscadle,2007-09-04T23:49Z,What program do I open to enjoy this? What do I download?
,Tech-Noir,2007-09-05T15:57Z,"Haven't done Kill 'Em All. Tried but it is hard to improve without remixing etc.


To ""use"" the files, you need to use a program that can read the .flac files. Newer versions of Winamp has a .flac decoder/reader built in, or you can download a flac plugin from winamp for older winamp versions. Windows Media Player I am not sure supports it. If you have a mp3 etc converter program, it might be able to convert the .flac files to .wav to get the raw .wav files out (which WMP can play)."
,JoshM22,2008-01-21T01:29Z,Someone please seed. I will re-seed when my download is finished.
,JoshM22,2008-01-21T02:28Z,All I can say is wow. This remaster is good enough to get an official release. The acoustic guitar in Fade to Black just shines like a diamond. Good work. Thank you
,Tech-Noir,2008-01-23T18:49Z,Well thanks mate. :)
,phound,2008-01-27T05:43Z,"great work...thanks for sharing all your talented efforts.

have you ever thought of doing a remaster of magical mystery tour (beatles)?  that would be an interesting project.

what other releases would you like to remaster?  you should submit a request page and we'll feed you the flacs, then you play with them and rerelease them!  :)"
,Tech-Noir,2008-01-28T03:40Z,"Thanks Phound. :)


I'm not sure what other things I would like to try. ROck and older songs aren't my main genre when listening to music, so my exposure to potentially ""bad"" quality material is quite limited. Most current releases are either very good quality because of advanced recording methods, or are so clipped and limited you can't really do anything to them.

Also there can only be certain things ""wrong"" with a song or such for me to be able to actually work on it. Clipping is impossible to recover from. Poorly balanced and EQd instruments in a song can also not be easily corrected in most cases. If I had multitrack mixes, now that would be sweet. But as far as I know there aren't any multitrack mixes to get ahold of easily. 5.1 mixes, where potential could be, aren't mixed (at all to my knowledge) with instruments on discreet channels.


But if you have examples of albums you think might be potential, do let me know. Also real trainwrecks can be fun to try, since they might be hard to make worse so to speak.


As for ""submitting a request page"", how do you suggest going about that? My idea would be adding a false torrent and then using that page for that, but not sure that would be appreciated by the founders and most of the users of this website. ""Spam"" comes to mind. :)



Again, thanks for the kind comments."
,phound,2008-01-28T08:46Z,"tech-noir:

yeah, you should probably skip the idea of spamming pb with a fake torrent page...never a good idea to piss off these vikings!  ;)

a better idea might be to have people submit their ideas here: http://pastebin.ca/875694

it's easily updated and never expires...the problem is that after each edit, a new url is generated, so the url needs to be reposted each time for people to see the changes...maybe not the best solution, after all.

another idea (which i'm kinda surprised pb hasn't done it yet) is to have content request pages...there should certainly be many pages for this, not one 'masterlist', since it would quickly get out of hand considering the volume of torrents on pb.  but i thought i'd create a prototype domain: piratebay.pastebin.ca

with a specific request here: http://piratebay.pastebin.ca/875712

hopefully, someone smarter than me can revise and improve upon this idea or come up with better ones.

cheers"
,Tech-Noir,2008-01-28T16:29Z,"Don't worry, I am from Sweden. ;)


As for the system that could be used, I think it might be better to perhaps use the comments page we are using now on TPB. Using that probably won't constitute spam.

Right now I have some time on my hands for a while, so I could take some suggestions. :)

I'll take a look at ""Cure - Disintegration"", might be a flac or wav up somewhere.


Also I've been looking some time for a flac of Killswitch Engage - Alive or Just Breathing, which could be tweaked a bit in my humble opinion. I find that on speakers most things can sound quite acceptable because of the very nature of speakers (the distance to the ears, the fact that you have ambience from the surroundings to help open up the sound and give space and ""air"" to any sound, etc), but I also use closed headphones and some things just need tweaking to sound good and not fatiguing on those types of situations.

I'm not looking to make an industry of this hehe, but if anyone has one of those albums that you just love, but always end up trying to equalize with the stereo or such whenever you listen to it to make it less harsh or whatever, it could be a good opportunity. :)"
,polishgirlzrock,2008-04-04T01:41Z,There was nothing wrong with it the way it was. Do you think Steve Hoffman doesnt know how to use the techniq
,Tech-Noir,2008-04-04T09:24Z,"Hey. :)

Well, this one wasn't as bad as Master Of Puppets, and this one is the one I probably didn't need to change all that much.

BUT, the approach Hoffman took on his Metallica masters was one of purity and keeping the recordings sounding the same. He didn't do much corrections in frequency bands and such. There are different approaches to what you can do when working on music, so you can do things differently without being inherently ""wrong""."
,roryrattlehead,2008-04-04T13:55Z,"anyone having anytrouble converting the FLAC file this site helped me out http://www.simplehelp.net/2006/08/14/how-to-convert-flac-files-to-mp3-using-windows/ it will show you how to convert the flac files to wav useing winamp,from there you can conver the wav files to mp3 with another program,i used magic video convertor,the albums work a treat now :)"
,Tech-Noir,2008-05-22T17:21Z,"Hehe. ;)
Ya, it's still a trainwreck. I never listen to it myself. :)"
,Focus88,2008-06-29T23:59Z,Thanks! =)

"
,fuckingmetallica,2008-07-09T03:19Z,"damn it , it wouldnt take the link so here ya go , fuck it . it's on youtube just search , Invisible Kid - St. Anger (Murphy's Remix)

,jaymzofmetallica,2008-08-19T07:56Z,"Tech-Noir, I was just thinking maybe you could remaster my band's demo cd? :D "
,jaymzofmetallica,2008-08-19T08:01Z,"Liked what you did with the remasters :D

What's your email address so I can send it to you directly... make the bass drum's double peds clearer and more solid....also the guitars try making them sound like metallica's sound :D hell yeah!!! "
,jaymzofmetallica,2008-08-19T08:04Z,You can try listening to our music at myspace or soundclick and search for fade of black or fadeofblack.... pls.....can you remaster our demo? :D
,Tech-Noir,2008-08-19T12:59Z,"jaymzofmetallica: Hey mate. :)

Well, I suppose I could take a listen. If I work only with the stereo master files, so to speak, I am very limited with what I can actually do. I only optimize and fix up songs and albums I know actually has potential to be fixed up with the limited methods I have available.
The recording is really the most important. If a bass drum is splashy and undefined when you record it, no amount of post-processing will make it great. It could be improved for sure if I had it isolated in an audio file separate from the rest of the drums. But only working on the stereo master files, that's a tough job. ;)

But if you want to send something be my guest, I'll take a listen and see what I can do, if anything, unless you could somehow get me separate files for the instruments etc (probably not likely but... ;) ).

,jaymzofmetallica,2008-08-20T14:33Z,"Tnx man!!! That would be great!!! I'll be sending them now to your email. I hope you could do something about those songs....

If not, still thanks for trying and giving it a shot :D 

Hell Yeah!!!"
,magemasher13,2008-10-07T08:41Z,"I gotta say man, you are incredible. I never really listened to Metallica until someone recommended one of their albums to me and I stumbled upon your torrent of ""Master of Puppets"" on Demonoid. I downloaded an MP3 of the same album to compare and the difference is really night and day. I went and got the rest of your Metallica work right after that and it was all awesome. I have to say, though, that this one was my least favorite of the bunch, but solely because the echo on the vocals seems ridiculously overdone, but that's not your fault."
,Tech-Noir,2008-10-12T02:45Z,"Yeah, it is really limiting working with stereo mixes.

What's cool is that Individual instrument tracks from Metallica's ""Death Magnetic"" have been uploaded on TPB. Sadly, the quality on the tracks are consistently poor despite being isolated. Vocals and drums are on the same track which sucks since those are the 2 parts of the songs that really need special individual attention since they are ""real"" sounds. An overdriven guitar can be EQed in alot of ways and still sounds great, same with bass. So I probably won't be able to do any mixes based on those individual tracks.

Thanks for the encouragement though. I know these aren't really great or even good in most cases, but in some cases you can make a trainwreck slightly more listenable. :)"
,rypro527,2008-11-21T01:23Z,"Hey tech noir, great job.  i was wondering if you could do a remaster of Led Zeppelin II, as the current 94 remaster sounds terrible in places (mainly the crash symbal.  It be awseome if you could get that to  sound good.  Also, maybe st anger too."
,Nolaquen,2009-03-17T04:46Z,"rypro527:

I have a torrent of *a* remaster of St. Anger.  I don't know how Teck-Noir's version would sound (if he did it) in comparison, but here's the link:

,Nolaquen,2009-03-17T04:48Z,"Tech-Noir, your Justice ""remaster"" was great!  Hah, you did a much better job than I could've ever done.  I use Cubase, but I'm waaaaay amateur.  You said you didn't like your remaster of Justice, but I liked it.  Good job."
,ChillyCrossFoot,2010-01-01T15:36Z,"Can someone PLEASE SEED THIS? Been stuck at ""0"" for the last few days! Thanks Tech-Noir :)"
,Tech-Noir,2010-01-19T22:32Z,"Hey, sorry for the 19 day delay... :/

Looks like a seeder is present now, hopefully that is enough. My poor ADSL is quite strained as it is.

Should you need to, just comment again and I'll come back and seed. :)"
,chunky70,2010-04-30T11:21Z,could someone reseed this please!stuck on 95%! Great remasters!
