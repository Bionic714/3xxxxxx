OMG - I loved the winter of 2005 when I was in Pattaya Thailand.  Then reality hit (ran out of $$)  But what the hey - after 3 months even I ran out.

This Cd that I scooped from one of the DJ's at Tony's Disco really brings back memories for me.  Many nights, not much sleep.............

Sorry but I don't remember all the names in the titles.  I'm not trying to be rude or anything but I thought some of you might enjoy the music even if it is getting like really ancient.

If you know any of the titles then please correct - thanks guys :)
