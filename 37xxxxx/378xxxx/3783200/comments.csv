,kupetzky,2007-12-30T02:59Z,how can you call 720x264 high definition?
,arakiri,2007-12-30T19:27Z,"@kupetzky: it's not 720x264... ""720p x264"" stands for ""1280x720 using the x264 codec""."
,NeverEnuf80,2008-04-26T05:30Z,"wow thas guy is stupid
lol..720px264...what kind of widescreen would that have been...like BenHur? lol
