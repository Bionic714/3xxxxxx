,Fproffs,2007-10-17T22:18Z,Many seeders but really slow (5 kB/s)!
,UserEcho,2007-10-20T02:10Z,"Excellent! thank you soooo much, downloading this torrent just showed me how many features itunes and ipod has that i never knew about. 
Zune software can play it but it doesnt show you the cool images and the chapters that you put in. And as crazy as it sounds, i just bought two of the 5th generation ipod classics partly because of this torrent. Thanks again!"

PLEASE SEED THESE!!!!!"
,FollunSeagil,2007-11-26T21:57Z,"Does anyone know if there is a 1-7 read by Stephen Fry. This one is Jim Dale, and though it works perfectly, Jim Dale SUCKS at reading these books. Please help."

,FaloopaJones,2007-12-04T17:02Z,"When I imported these files into iTunes, I did NOT get chapters - I only got 8+ hour long single tracks.  The only artwork is the book cover for each file: not the chapter art. 

Anyone know why this didn't separate for me? I'm running Leopard and iTunes 7.9

It's nice to have the books, but I'm not going to listen to eight hours of audio in one sitting!"
,kornchild2002,2007-12-11T07:04Z,"I just have to say thanks for this.  The audio quality is great as audio books don't need 190kbps VBR encoding.  64kbps is more that suitable especially with the mpeg-4 AAC audio format.  I also appreciate the addition of chapters as all the audio books I have previously downloaded had each chapter in its own mp3 file and I had to make playlists.

I have all of the books on hardback but it is nice having a audio book for long trips.  I plan on seeding this for quite a bit of time as I know many people are having download speed issues.  I am currently downloading it at 2kB/s even though I have other downloads going at 300kB/s.  Oh well, except a long seeding time from me at speeds of around 200kB/s."
,bigsanfrey,2007-12-15T10:40Z,"I love this torrent!! When I get towards the end of the month I will download the rest! I have got the first book so far and it is good, the reader says some words a bit weird but its alright! Worked fine on my iPod classic 6th gen (80gb model)"

,Alex460,2007-12-28T05:18Z,"The description states that each file is subdivided into chapters.
How exactly does that work? 
Do I hit next while listening and it jumps to the next chapter? Or are they managed as separate files within iTunes? 
And how does the art display while listening on an iPod? Does it switch when you go into the next chapter, or perhaps it doesn't display correctly?"
,Alex460,2007-12-28T05:19Z,"@kr0401: Look back in the comments - a commenter stated they're performed by Dale, and that they didn't like his performance.  I can't comment, as I'm not downloading these for myself."
,Oo la la,2008-01-01T16:56Z,"i have to say, you put a lot of work into this, and thats pretty cool."
,tbharker,2008-01-02T21:36Z,Jim Dale is my favorite reader of ALL TIME.  He rules!  Anyone that disagrees is a freak.
,SMDoles,2008-01-02T22:40Z,"Thanks alot for this man.

The quality is great and having it broken down into chapters is awesome. Also having the pictures from the book for each chapter is a nice touch. ;-)

I have it on my new 3g Nano I got for Christmas and couldn't be more pleased! 

Thanks again! Cheers!"
,bigsanfrey,2008-01-06T12:29Z,"""The description states that each file is subdivided into chapters.
How exactly does that work?""
The book is one file but the chapters are like a normal book...

Do I hit next while listening and it jumps to the next chapter?
Yes, and if you hit back it goes back a chapter :)

Or are they managed as separate files within iTunes?
Nope, they are all one file

And how does the art display while listening on an iPod?
Like an album art work i guess

Does it switch when you go into the next chapter, or perhaps it doesn't display correctly? 
It switches with each new chapter."

,omega1147,2008-03-16T23:56Z,Use any sound editor that displays audio wave form large spikes can bee seen where the pops are not to mention they do not match the rest of the wave form near the spike or pop visually. if anyone knows what a sine wave even a stepped sine wave looks like. it is possible this could be dependent on where you are in the world and who you download from. there is no telling i guess i am just telling everyone what i personally found thats it and thats all.

It is bad enough that it will repeat its self a fraction of a second either this torrent has been corrupted or bfett9 does not know what a ripping error is no offense intended.

,mbrguy,2008-04-01T09:19Z,"I've downloaded this and tried it out.  It works fine for me.  I see that Omega1147 has had problems with the audio.  I've tried it out and haven't found the problems he has had.  I did hear one twitch, but nothing much.  The audio sounds good, and It loaded fine on my ipod and plays good also.  On itunes, there is no chapters or chapter artwork, but there is artwork and chapters on the ipod.

A big thanks to bfett9 for uploading this great torrent.

Even though the format is m4b, I had no problem playing them.  I was never asked for a username or password.  I just imported it into itunes, and clicked on Audiobooks, and there they were.

,mbrguy,2008-04-07T08:39Z,"I've had more of a chance now to listen to these books, and I'm extremely glad I got these.  I've only had a few glitches where when I unpaused it after a class or work, it started over and I had to find my place again, but nothing more than that, and I can't really complain, can I?  It is free!!  Much thanks goes out to bfett9.  "
,smartarse93,2008-04-08T06:31Z,"M4B can be imported to iTunes and converted easily VIA the Advanced Menu on Macs and PC's.  I have created AudioBooks myself and to make it bookmarkable I have changed the Extension to M4B.  There is NO DRM in these files, I have them now on my old Creative Zen listening to them, I also have them on my iPod Touch and they work flawlessly also.   This uploader took his own time to make these so all you people who say this is worthless are worthless as they didnt think outside the square and probably didnt even download them.

Give the Upper a litlle credit jeez people.

,Duncan33,2008-04-09T05:21Z,"Great torrent. Only problem with it is in one of The Order of the Phoenix chapters. In ""The Woes of Mrs. Weasley"" a section of the chapter about 10 to 15 minutes is missing from the chapter. That part when Mrs. Weasly was facing the boggart and Lupin stepped in. There's supposed to be more to it but it cuts straight into the next chapter. Hopefully you could find time to fix that."

BitTorrent is a file sharing protocol. You download a tiny .torrent file which you feed into a BitTorrent client application and it'll let you download the file from many different people at once. As for M4B files, you'll probably need iTunes to listen to them after you download them from the swarm. Swarm is shorthand for the group of people you connect to to download a particular torrent."

,ayush27,2012-01-28T12:09Z,"If people are saying that this is great........they probably have NOT read the books properly.......
I am a hardcore Harry Potter fan.....and due to these 4 mistakes which i found on GotF and OotP audiobooks, i think it ruins the entire collection.

1. In OotP, Ch9, When Lupin says ""Riddikulus"", the chapter ends and almost 2 pages of text is missing!!!!

AND in GotF, the remaining 3 mistakes were found:

2&3. Chapter Name of Priori Incantatem and Veritaserum has a Spelling Mistake.

3. When the Chapter ""The Dream"" is played, Jim Dale speaks: Chapter 29, .....eam""

I mean to say, he doesn't say ""The Dr"" at all....so unless the uploader fixes these errors, these audiobooks are useless to me!!!!!!!!! PLZZ FIX THIS"
