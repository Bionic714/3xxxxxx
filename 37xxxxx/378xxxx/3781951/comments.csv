,mrq2,2007-08-25T20:49Z,"I didn't expect it to work , but it did, like a charm. Installed on an Athlon64 3200+ with Asus A8N-E motherboard(note: not a Dell computer).

,smithster,2007-09-10T19:14Z,"@kiahq83

hey mate, once this torrent is downloaded there will be 4 MWVU files (part1, part2, part3 and part4).
there will also be the Winrar installation file.

Firstly install Winrar as normal.
Then the 4 MWVU part files will change icon and become assosiated with Winrar.

Right click on the first part file, which should be named
""MWVU.part1.rar""
Click on Extract Here
and let Winrar do its job!

After that the Vista Ultimate ISO file should be in the same folder.

Simply burn this to a DVD+R or DVD-R disc at the lowest possible speed using your favourite dvd burning program and BINGO. Vista DVD :-)

Enjoy!"
,kiahq83,2007-09-10T21:22Z,"thanks alot smithster, but i do have 1 question though. if i only need to burn part 1 on the dvd then what is the point of downloading the other 3 parts."
,lsme420,2007-09-11T07:03Z,Srry about last post I dont know what went wrong.Works now 100% Great torrent.
,smithster,2007-09-11T22:33Z,"@kiahq83

Winrar split the big GB file into small chunks which improves download speeds when torrenting.

When you right click on part1 and click Extract Here, it firstly extracts part 1, then part 2, and part 3 and finally part 4. If you watch the files its extracting whilst its extracting you will see it change to part 2, 3, 4 after a while.

Technically you could click on any file and it would simply extract the entire 4 parts into one.

Don't ask me how it does it though! It just does :-) Its pretty ace.

Hope its ok"

,DolphWulff,2007-11-17T15:12Z,"JUST TO CLARIFY: THIS IS NOT LIKE THE XP DELL OEM CDs THAT NEVER WANTED TO BE ACTIVATED REGARDLESS OF THE HARDWARE THEY WERE INSTALLED ON. THIS OEM DVD WILL ONLY BE AUTO-ACTIVATED IF YOUR BIOS HAS A DELL OEM CODE IN THE SLIC TABLE OF YOUR BIOS.

If you're feeling adventurous, you can patch a BIOS image yourself. There are tools for AMI bioses (like most ASUS motherboards use, for example), and Award BIOSes, probably more. For AMI, you need the AMIOEMSLIC program. There's a small howto here, with links:

http://stevejobs.blogs.keznews.com/2007/05/24/ami-bios-tool-by-gkend/

The howto is not entirely complete though, I'll write one at the bottom of this message.

A lot of people put out patched BIOSes for different motherboards. Try doing a Google search for ""vista slic bios "" and see if something doesn't show up.

Anyway, here's a more accurate howto on the AMIOEMSLIC procedure. Please note that the ""original BIOS .ROM"" file I'm talking about should be downloaded from the website of your motherboard manufacturer, look under downloads or updates or something like that. Okay, here's my modified howto:

======

Make sure the original BIOS .ROM file is not writeprotected, and back it up or work on a copy.

Then open MMTOOL, click ""Load ROM"", select the .ROM BIOS file, in the list at the bottom select the line with ID ""1B"", click the ""Extract"" tab, click ""Browse"", choose the name ""1B.rom"" for the file, then click ""Extract"".

Close the program and open up AMIOEMSLIC, for ""1B????"" browse and select the 1B.rom file you just extracted, for ""SLIC????"" browse and select the SLIC you want from the ones that are included in the AMIOEMSLIC package (they're inside the SLIC subfolder), for ""??BIOS??"" browse and select the original BIOS .ROM file we extracted the 1B.rom from, then click ""??1B??"", click ""OK"", then click ""???BIOS"", click ""Yes"".

Close the program and open up the MMTOOL program once more, click ""Load ROM"", select the original .ROM BIOS file, again in the list at the bottom select the line with ID ""1B"", click the ""Replace"" tab, click ""Browse"", choose the name ""1B.rom"" file that is now patched, then click ""Replace"". Finally click ""Save ROM"", and the BIOS should be patched with the SLIC of your choice. Check the ""Date Modified"" of the .ROM file in Explorer to confirm that it has indeed been modified.

Install Vista."
,DolphWulff,2007-11-17T15:14Z,"Of course, you have to actually flash your motherboard's BIOS with the new ROM before installing Vista. Consult your manual or motherboard manufacturer's website on how to do that. ;)"
,Hieroma,2007-11-18T13:27Z,Multi ?
,DolphWulff,2007-11-19T16:36Z,"no, this is only 32-bit ultimate"
,ben boyd,2008-01-29T06:15Z,"thanks, worked a treat on my Dell GX280.


though I think I'll be going back to XPpro, Vista's just too bloated."
,anujpathania,2008-03-01T06:06Z,"Great Torrent!!!

Works on non - dell PC's Too perfectly."
,turn2dust,2008-03-03T22:56Z,can anyone verify this is an original dell image and not one of these hacked copys with bootloader?
,MISTA_VISTA,2008-04-30T11:00Z,"oh dear oh dear , another Dell Vista Ultimate thats a "" Dead "" download , why put it up, if your not gonna seed it..Lmfao"
,mister2008,2008-05-12T00:06Z,So does this work after you INSTALL the SP1 and other updates because AFTER you install you SP1 Vista asks for your product key for re activation purposes. So is there any way we can obtain the ORIGINAL product key because eventhough I am installing this torrent on a DELL XPS400 im pretty sure it will ask me for the product key after updating windows.
