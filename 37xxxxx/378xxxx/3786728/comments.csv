,Remaeus,2007-08-28T16:56Z,I think MekTek has done very well at keeping the MechWarrior game alive.

,Phatt,2008-09-05T07:10Z,"Hi guys, Mechwarrior rules.

I have original versions of all the MW series, and am looking to get back into playing in the MW Mercs leagues again. Unfortunately the links to the patches at MekTek do not work for me.

Remaeus Would it be possible to upload a file that just contains the patch files; mercpr1.exe, mekpak302a(pr1).wnp, mekpak302b(302a).exe the two .reg files for the game trackers please.

I need these files to play in the MWMercs league.

PS. Just for all you diehard fans like me, Makemesoft sold all the Mechwarrior licences back to the original owners and they say there will be a new version of Mechwarrior in the near future.
