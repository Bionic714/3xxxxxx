,Minarelli,2007-08-27T08:22Z,Must be the slowest seeder thinkable. Closed at night though a great numer of leechers hanging around. Don't put up uploads if you're not prepared to seed at least as long as it takes a few leachers to become seeders!
,66dino66,2007-08-27T14:24Z,"No, when computer breaks down, its hard to seed anything. But thanx for your sarcastic comment, as I'm sure you are the greatest seeder on the planet. Don't open your mouth unless you know the situation. Thank you for your patience....."
,Minarelli,2007-08-27T19:22Z,"You want me to apologize? Well, well, well - computer all broken down... Shit like that happens, and then it exclude you from my wining. That is - in a way - my way to say sorry! :-)))))"
