,ddelta,2007-12-23T07:58Z,"I have 3.71 M33-4 keeps on crashing before start screen...

Anyone able to get it working? I put it in this folder
--PSP
-----GAME
---------GBA%
---------GBA

I even unrar the roms but it keeps on detecting corrupted data.

I even took the contents out of the games folders .ie adventure & RPG and put all files in the GBA% folder and still keeps crashing with an 8xxxxx code"
,deamon2000,2008-01-28T05:15Z,put gba and gba% in the game150 folder if u dont have one use windows to creat the folder and name it game150
