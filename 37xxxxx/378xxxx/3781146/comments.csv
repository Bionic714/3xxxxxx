It had a hateful, one-sided message that the Jews are the only aggressors and the Palestinians have no blame for the lack of peace in Israel, that any terrorist action is just a result of the so called ?occupation.? The fact is the movie was littered with anti-Semitism and omissions of dire truths about U.S. foreign aid to Israel and aggression pursued by the Palestinians onto the Israelis.""

In addition, many of the interviews were with non-palestinian, non-muslim congressmen, congresswomen and highly regarded individuals working with Amnesty International. Who do I believe? You... or them? Hmmm"
