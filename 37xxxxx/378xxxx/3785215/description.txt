The last of the '70's Bon Scott albums, "Highway to Hell" is arguably the best AC/DC CD, save for "Back in Black". What Bon had that his successor does not is an authentic bluesy swagger, and wolf- like howl. When Bon sang it, you believed it. This is real bar brawl music and requires a swig of whiskey and some Camels to thoroughly enjoy. These songs rock from start to finish, and with no dogs, this is just about as good as AC/DC gets. Highly recommended, especially "Night Prowler", one of the best ending songs ever recorded.
