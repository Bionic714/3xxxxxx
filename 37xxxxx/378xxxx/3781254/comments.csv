,luke321321,2007-08-22T20:54Z,"This is working, tested on my vista ultimate x86, this works where other cracks haven't worked"
,GhostEntity,2007-08-24T02:58Z,This works because after 8 years now i think Paradox is still kicking ass these guys are the best.
,Fosho2inc,2007-08-25T02:57Z,is bill gates banned from tpb yet or does he still dl osx from here well just in case he isint banned yet i wouldent know if this works cause i bought vista at bestbuy and i did not activate it this way but it works but i used my key i bought (at bestbuy)
,gr8erthan_u,2007-08-29T02:12Z,Glad I didn't go out and waste $200+ on vista Ultimate freakin LOOOOOOSERS! Thank you PIRATEBAY!!
,icingD,2007-08-29T22:45Z,I got an issue with royal.sys giving me a blue screen on one machine (but on another it worked great). Any help would be greatly appreciated... 
,Ercenberht,2007-09-02T16:23Z,it works
,titanium8,2007-09-26T16:17Z,"Used it 3 times on Vista Ultimate, worked every time. Thanks"
,IchigoKurosaki,2007-09-28T03:18Z,"Fellow Pirates, I regret to inform you I have some very disappointing news. Today I just downloaded Windows Vista Ultimate Slip-Streamed SP1 Beta and when I used this Crack (seeing that I lost my Free Ultimate Key) it stated in the System properties that it needed to be activated and when I clicked on it, It gave me the option to Purchase Windows Vista Key, Type a different Product Key or Contact Microsoft. My only guess is that when you install SP1 once it's released you will be faced with the same problem...  "

,MaDxCrEaM,2007-11-26T20:22Z,Is there a OEM BIOS Emulator for x64 version of Vista? Or will this work for it? This just states x86 though. Thanks for any help.
,D3ception,2007-12-31T00:48Z,"As a warning just as IchigoKurosaki said this crack does NOT work with SP1. 

again: DOES NOT WORK WITH SP1!

so don't update until someone gives a working patch/crack fro sp1."
,theman2000,2008-01-28T02:56Z,"hey sorry but i got confused with step 5, what do i do with step 5 thanks"
,tnyngboi,2008-03-07T07:01Z,"It's hard to find the Paradox x64 version of this activator.  Sadly, the Cloney ones always get in the way when I search for it."
,Nike72man,2008-03-17T07:53Z,Tested on HP OEM VISTA x86.....I had only 3days left. This one fixed it. Thanxxxxx.
,abibias,2008-03-31T04:45Z,"thanks for this shit, but i still get a problem, i get ""blue screen"" wtf why? anyone knows why?"
,QBMan,2008-04-11T13:18Z,"I have used this on Vista Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate, no problems with ANY of them. I have installed all updates and SP1 with no problems reported.

Only one that didn't work was Home Premium Retail, seemed ok at first but then had problems when using updates. This seems to require nothing more than an OEM set-up. I'm sure Paradox with develope a keygen for retail versions like they did with XP professional :-)"
,Ianp,2008-05-13T09:08Z,"I used this method with Vista HP and it worked fine! That is until I updated SP1. A new update sees SL*** and the reverts me back to ""15 days to activate"" :(   I think if everybody checks for new updates, this now fails.  Hope Paradox has a new one soon."
,tonytgman,2008-06-18T01:15Z,I tried this about 4 times to get it to work but no go! I then found an activation tool that was easier to use and worked the first time. You'll find it by typing; (vista activation W/ serial keys) in the pirate search. Thanks again censorme for that dl.....
,peterur,2008-07-14T15:26Z,tusen tack hoppas det funkar
,QBMan,2008-11-13T00:38Z,"In an experiment I did this. Made 'Clone' of the BIOS ACPI_SLIC from my laptop. Saved to Memory stick :-) Using the free OEM disk I had with the laptop loaded that on to my Desktop PC. 
Used OEMTools to load 'clone' to Desktop.. This activated Vista.. Did all updates, then SP1, Back to 15 day activation. Went to Control panel selected System and pressed 'Change Product Key'. Disconnected from Internet then typed in the product key from my laptop.. Windows Vista SP1 activated... Removed the OMEtools emulator.. Ok so I only have home basic at the moment but more experimenting to... But hope this helps.."
,siggomar,2008-12-06T16:26Z,Worked fine for me on an Acer Aspire X3200
