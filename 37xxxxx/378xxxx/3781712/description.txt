? 	Gigolo con-man Latigo Smith (Garner) needs to get something 
off his chest - the tattooed name of his most recent ex-fiance. But while 
he's waiting for the local doctor to sober up and perform the operation, 
Smith overhears that local mining baron Taylor Baton (Harry Morgan) 
is looking to shut down his mining competition by hiring the notorious 
gunman, Swifty Morgan. Seizing the opportunity for an easy con, Smith 
passes off a reprobate cow-hand (Jack Elam) as the dreaded Swifty, 
and pockets the cash. Bankroll in hand, he plans to head for the hills?
until he falls for Barton's pistol-packin' daughter, Patience 
(Suzanne Pleshette). But when the real Swifty shows up looking for blood, 
Smith comes up with an outrageous scheme to save his hide, stop the 
mining feud and win over Patience -- and it might just work?if it doesn't 
blow up the entire town!
