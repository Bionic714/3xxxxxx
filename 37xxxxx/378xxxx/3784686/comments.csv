,theRealKarmine,2008-06-08T03:38Z,"someone also put this movie on mini, but its 700mb with claims it has great vid/audio. considering this is a 3 hour movie that doesnt make sense.  this release makes more sense....2gb with great vid/audio quality despite it being a 70's flick.

all hail the headless cat."
