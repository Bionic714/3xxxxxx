Dr Steven Jones speaks at Project for the New American Citizen about his latest
findings regarding the physics of the WTC collapses that happened on September 11 2001.

"Steven Earl Jones is an American physicist. For most of his career, Jones was 
known mainly for his work on muon-catalyzed cold fusion. In the fall of 2006, amid controversy surrounding his work on the collapse of the World Trade Center, he was relieved of his teaching duties and placed on paid leave from Brigham Young University. On October 20, 2006, he announced his retirement. His hypothesis is that the World Trade Center was destroyed by controlled demolition during the September 11 attacks, not the impact of the airplanes that hit them or the fires that followed. Jones' theory about the September 11 attacks is part of many 9/11 conspiracy theories."
