A nice, little radio talkshow, hosted by an ex-cop out of Arizona. 

The show is very akin to Coast to Coast AM. Same sort of topics etc. But I always end up feeling as if I have received more information from Kevin's 2-hour show, than what I'm getting from Coast's 4-hour show.

If you like Coast To Coast AM, chances are that you will like this show, as well.
