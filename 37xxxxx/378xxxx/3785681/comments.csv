,satanmr,2007-08-27T06:40Z,i see what you mean about the voice.
,SK234269,2007-08-27T07:37Z,"LOL! - irritated or enchanted?  Either way, she's very nice to look at . . ."
,SK234269,2007-08-27T08:24Z,"Ah, here we go -- seeding slowly but surely.  Ignore the above warning for now ;)"
,brettman,2007-08-27T14:36Z,I'm not 100% sure this works but I download pretty damn fast. I have comcast but i use Bitcomet an older version and change the torrent port. It's in the preferences somewhere. You can't miss it. The I opened the port I had opened on my firewall and router and I get great speed. Over 400 kb/s on some torrents. Now my trick may do nothing but I read it on a site and it did increase my speeds. Try it if you want. Seemed to work to me.
,theman007,2007-10-26T22:32Z,how do i get this shit to download?
,cplbeaudoin,2007-11-10T18:01Z,Thanks for posting.  Do you have Kennedy?
,PeterAichinger,2007-11-26T06:00Z,"Maybe protocol encryption would fool your provider. I don't know about your client but uTorrent offers this possibility exactly for that reason.

Thx for uploading this girl, it is one of my favorites from nubiles.net. (Great pics there btw, even better maybe than Karups.) I hope I can get her soon, at the moment dl is very slow.

Do you have Samantha too? (I generally prefer blondes.)"
,PeterAichinger,2007-12-09T17:18Z,Finished downloading her movies and I think the voice is not squeeky at all. It is just a normal voice.
,SK234269,2008-02-17T08:54Z,No Samantha :(
,tak3r187,2008-02-23T13:27Z,"thanks for this. downloading at the moment but this will take time because i donÂ´t have so fast i-net -.-

Do you have Tosha and/or Katrina too?"
,TheDarkyLord,2010-07-31T21:31Z,Please seed! :) I know this is an old torrent but I want it! :)
