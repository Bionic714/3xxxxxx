,jljl999,2010-01-31T19:12Z,Thanks for this upload. I used to own the original vinyls of the 1968 version but it's long since disappeared. I have fond memories of the Toronto Stage Performance. Brel's songs are just magical. I wouldn't mind hearing the original Mort Shuman version too.... Thanks again
