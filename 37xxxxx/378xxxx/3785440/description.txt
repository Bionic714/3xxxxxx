Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris [1994 London Revival Cast] mp3

This is the 1994 London Revival Cast recording of Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris.  This version features Michael Cahill, Alison Egan, Liz Greenaway, and Stuart Pendred.  It is NOT the Mort Schuman/Eric Blau version.  If there is sufficient interest, I may post that recording later.

This version is a two-CD set; the torrent contains each track as an mp3 plus my shitty digital camera photos of the cover art.  I will try to seed this as long as there is interest in it; however, I might need to restart my computer occasionally.   So, don't worry if I disappear for a few minutes.

Enjoy!
