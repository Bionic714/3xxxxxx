? 	Academy Award-nominee Majid Majidi explores the world 
of a gifted blind boy at the mercy of his father's crippling sense of 
shame in The Color Of Paradise.

Mohammad joyfully returns to his tiny village on summer vacation 
from the Institute for the Blind, unaware of his widowed father's 
intentions to disown him in order to win the hand -- and dowry -- of 
a local woman. With the wedding swiftly approaching, Mohammad's 
future hangs precariously in the balance as his father struggles against 
his destiny, unable to see the wonder of life and love that's so clear 
to his son.
