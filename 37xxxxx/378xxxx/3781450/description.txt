Plot: Meet the Laemies - and taste the terror in this black comedy. Dad's (RANDY QUAID) got a great job, Mom (MARY BETH HURT) has all the modern conveniences a happy homemaker could ask for, and ten-year-old Michael (BRIAN MADORSKY) has neat new friends and two parents that kill him with kindness. They're the all-American family of 1954...with one small exception.
