,HarkenWulfgar,2007-08-28T15:29Z,"although as long as it's a ok copy of the game you could download it now and wait for the crack to save you downloading crack + game later...

unless I'm missing something?"

,pipoxyz,2007-08-29T11:12Z,"I really hope 2k really feels the pain of their protection that has so obviously crossed the border of what ppl wanna pay for.
As for protection, i found that you can torrent anonimously now..really cool stuff: www.i2p.net/ "

Crack Install Instructions:

1) Put ""paul.dll"" & ""Boishock.exe"" in your install folder (backup the originals incase)

2) Run secu.eg.reg (importing it into the registry)

3) Play Bioshock

4) Visit stansdad.com for free South Park episodes!


Another crack that you can try. I still don't have the game to try it, but sooner or later there will be a working crack. Until then try this, hopefully it works!

	I swear i have seen lots of people say it is working on Vista but not so many on xp and there is no way i change to that piece of crap vista just to play this.

	I just need to get one last thing clarified from people who have successfully installed & ran the game.When it's mentioned to copy the crack files into the respective Bioshock release directory should we replace it over the existing files like "
,slick7,2007-09-03T04:07Z,When installing the game it says insert the real disc when i get to the updating part then press ok.....When i press ok the intallation exits
,xxxmando69,2007-09-10T00:07Z,"I'm having the same issues as slick7.

Any ideas?"
,Jonnysg,2007-09-11T23:55Z,"It's easy, when the installation ask you for insert the real disk, just kill the process. After, unzip the crack in the release folder of the game and run the .reg.

Done! Have fun!"
