Ehm i guess you didnt pay attention in you history class at school. 
Germany had paratroopers in small scale in Poland, large scale in Netherlands, again smallscale in Norway (six companies taking Oslo) and yes there where shootings, large scale in Crete (Aegean campaign), some action in North Africa, there where even fallshirmjägers supporting germanys sixth army in southern russia.

Not to mention the rescue of Mussolini in Italy

,Budge4,2007-08-24T00:01Z,Not too sure why it says windows 64 bit not supported either because just finished playing demo on win xp 64 bit and it ran without any problems at all (was'nt in xp compatible mode either)
,Budge4,2007-08-24T00:13Z,"Demo is very good, mission against Italian Blackshirts in Operation Husky. Release date is shown as 4th Sept in demo, know some shops in uk have it as a 7th Sept release. Another place to get demo is   http//:www.gamershell.com   Was downloading at about 300k/sec when i got it earlier.   "

,kaptenmange,2007-08-28T09:57Z,"Knaster eny one can say that is is propaganda for the natzi army. Right in the begining they say ""The german army is on its way to Victory. Join the battel aginst all enemys of the empire. Join the airborn"""
[T],Knaster,2007-08-28T17:13Z,"So? Is that so strange, the first one is a journal about the Fallshirmjägers! That doesnt mean it never happened. Everything filmed in action during ww2 was used as propaganda  for its own people no matter if they were american, british, german etc.  The point is its not propaganda anymore it's a historic document. And dont come say they are false cause i have a phd in history"
,MBenjo,2007-08-29T15:55Z,LOLZORZ Historic discussion xD
[T],Knaster,2007-08-29T21:13Z,"kaptenmange and btw there were no ""nazi army"" it was the German wehrmacht although some Heer korps were Waffen SS  (separate from wehrmacht with it's own officers ranks) subordinate to Heinrich Himmler sometimes operating separate and in conjunction with OKW or the operational General i command of the district in question.
