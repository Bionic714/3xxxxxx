,Ginge007,2008-10-02T17:43Z,"I'm having a problem with file size. it says ""Torrent Error
File: Overlord.iso
File exceeds file system size limit""
is there a way that I can up the limit or do I need to wait until I'm done with some other torrents in order to proceed?"
,big-oinker,2009-10-22T15:25Z,its your hard drive file system thats the problem ... fat32 have a 1 gb file size limit ... either format the drive with ntfs or save the file to a ntfs formatted hard drive (it can be done in the download options for the file)
