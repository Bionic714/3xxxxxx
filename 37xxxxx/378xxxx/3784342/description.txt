Controlling a mysterious figure that has inherited the legacy of the evil, long-dead Overlord, the player emerges, near death, from the ruins of the old Overlords Dark Tower. Only the players actions will determine if they will rise to become the new all-powerful Overlord; its all down to how much of a bad ass they want to be in order to succeed evil or really evil! Played out with plenty of black humour and dark irony, the game will immerse players in twisted parodies of classic fantasy scenarios and characters.
