,superj358,2007-08-27T20:50Z,tell me how the fuck you fit XP into a 500MB file?????
,Gerry_A,2007-08-28T06:21Z,What's the difference between this Xp and the 200 others (other than being stripped down)?
,mu57i11,2007-08-29T15:05Z,"If you actually looked at the sizes of normal xp torrents on here (Those that have nothing intergreated) you would no that this is the right size for a normal xp cd.
Am i to assume that when you said that you thought 500 mb was to small for xp that you thought that the size of the downloaded .iso should match the size of the os once its installed?
Now from what I can remember a normal xp installs to about 2 gb. Based on your ^, Anyone with some computer knolige would no that 2 gb would not fit onto a cd. Taking this into account, could you explain why xp comes on cd's and not dvd's?

In other words your retarded, and this isn't stripped in any way."
