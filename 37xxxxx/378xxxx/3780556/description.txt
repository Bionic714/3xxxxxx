Voice buddy is an amazing program, it works GREAT with FS2004 and FSX, for those who dont have a joystick with a whole lot of buttons and want to keep up with friends, this is the answer. just say something like \"Retract Gear\" and BOOM you\'re gear is up. 

This works for all games! not just MSFS, which is what i only use it for. There are tons of pre made ones so that you dont have to set all the voice commands up and stuff, but there are gonna be some missing games in there so you will have to start from scratch once and a while, FSX is not in there though, but i just use the FS2004 pre made one to play with FSX, almost all commands are same but if they dont have a command like lets say...Fuel Dump then just add it real quick.
