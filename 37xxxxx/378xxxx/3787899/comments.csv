,potman83,2007-08-29T18:53Z,"""xeyel"" u stupid fucking cunt u must be blind, how can u call this a good quality, u fúcking a hole. suck my ass"
,b17tony,2007-08-29T19:45Z,"whoa hey potman83, if it's good quality to them, then let them think that. everyone is entitled to their own opinions and what they think is good quality might be crap to us. we're just used to top-quality aXXo releases. so don't shit on someone when they are just giving their own fucking opinion, asshole. and loudgeorgeod, thanks for the upload. good job m8!"

,xXxakajt,2007-08-30T00:04Z,"Same Quality as the CAM version.. actually, it IS the CAM-version.

rather go for the http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3784502/Superbad.TS.INTERNAL.XViD-mVs

Still CAM, but sound is Much better, and the audience laughing is gone. 
Picture is roughly 4/10, so  its watchable, but its still a cam. sound is 7/10

,fudo_85,2007-08-30T13:33Z,jebem vas u dupe
,ektakrome,2007-08-31T07:06Z,i really don't think that you have any say in anything unless you contribute instead of simply leeching what everyone else spends their time to upload to everyone.
,potman83,2007-08-31T18:04Z,ok sorry xeyel......NOT.
,cyks,2007-09-05T06:45Z,Any known versions that actually include the hilarious credit sequence?

,burnit999,2007-09-08T03:19Z,"Thanks for the upload this was a good quality cam version.  The sound was just fine for me so I'm not sure what the complaining was about.  I guess some people expect dvd quality from a cam or something lol. 

This gets 6/10 for your average yet still good cam version."
,catchow58,2007-09-08T21:15Z,"I liked this cam version. It feels like going out to the movies on a Friday night.   You hear the whole audience laughing instead of one guy sitting behind the the camera, and you get to see the audience file out in sihouette against  those awesome closing credits.  It adds to the fun."
,104443,2007-09-09T02:07Z,"when I open this in quicktime, all it is is green screen for 12 seconds, how do I get it to work?"
,aldicko,2007-09-09T20:51Z,"why dont you all shut the fuck up and let people make there own minds up. if they want to try it they will, if they dont they wont. chill."
,KayeBeast,2007-09-10T22:49Z,"104443, don't use quicktime as its a big old pile of dirty man poo. you should use VLC PLAYER instead. http://www.videolan.org/"
,naduli,2007-09-12T21:15Z,Please seed :-)
,sy_lennox,2007-09-14T20:36Z,"i don't see the point in moaning about something some1 says, yeah it's great then you DL and turns out to be rubbish, if it was hard work to DL or cost you money i'd see you point, just be thankful it doesn't cost anything"
,kushman,2007-09-15T04:32Z,"Thanks for the upload, this movie is one of the funniest I've seen in years.

And fuck all of you ingrateful pieces of shit who whine about quality.  What do you expect from a CAM?  Why don't you spring the money to go see it in the theater instead of complain about someone who is nice enough to spend thier time putting this up for you to download?  You didn't pay for this, so you have no right to complain.  You are the like a bum who curses somebody  who gives them $1 because they didn't get $5.  Don't look a gifthorse in the mouth assholes."
,SHITHAED87,2007-09-16T22:24Z,this is bullshit 
,panicpling,2007-09-17T13:01Z,"oh my god, det här var den sämsta kvaliten på länge! jag tror jag väntar med den här filmen tills någon kommer med en bättre release..."

,Rudster65,2007-09-17T22:50Z,"Thanks for the Download, But The quality is horrible"
,Gorikkie,2007-09-17T23:13Z,"Omfg this is the worst version of a movie i have ever seen, there is actually a audience laughing every time something funny happens."
,FTW2000,2007-09-18T20:46Z,:kushman: Well spoken!
,plastikmen,2007-09-21T10:00Z,"quality sucks, quality sucks why dont you get your asses up and get better copy. "

,Candy1690,2007-10-17T02:20Z,"thanks for the upload, great movie"
,LostDude,2007-10-18T14:48Z,"You know,

There IS a way to avoid all this nonsense between uploaders (or should I say n00b uploaders), whingers and n00b uploader's defense attorneys.

IF ALL uploaders stuck to protocol and named their files correctly, the entire world would be a better place.  

Using the correct tags in the name will divert any potential whingers avoiding the need for the n00b uploader's defense attorneys to rebut or refut any complaints. This in turn phases out rubbish releases in favor to quality rips, ultimately resulting in a much much healthier Internet infrustructure.

All in ALL, if ALL uploaders properly named their torrents... EVERYONE will be better off."
,hemmawiberg,2007-10-20T19:12Z,"this one is just crap, do not dowload - not worth it."
,Zeroes,2007-11-05T19:18Z,"You flaming comment trolls are annoying as hell, of course anyone with half a mind will know that Super Bad will be a video camera version, the fact that these people took their time to do this is outstanding. There is not ""dvd-rip"" because no person is lame enough to go and steal the dvd's from the theater."
,durriken,2007-11-08T20:12Z,if you want DVD then just wait a bit - on the other hand people would do well to simply label their seeds correctly. thanks and good day
,engconboy,2007-11-11T12:42Z,"i must disagree, i have a friend that works at a theater, and he takes his laptop, and rips the theaters dvds "
,fartoeasy,2007-11-16T11:23Z,why even put this on the web?? give me a axxo rip!!
,reneerom,2007-12-18T03:16Z,huergyu
[T],nigeldpablo,2008-03-26T12:53Z,"thanks for trying , forget about all the nay sayers , 99% of them have never taking the time to give back , most of them just leech you till you are dry "
