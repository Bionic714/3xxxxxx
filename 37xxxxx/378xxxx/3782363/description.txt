But for all the blood evidence left at the scene, nothing points to the identity of the killer. Everyone is a suspect, and someone is getting away with murder. At a dead end, police fly psychic Phil Jordan down to Georgia to see if he can shed some light on the case. As Jordan gets into the car with the detectives, he senses he's being pulled and begins giving directions. Winding through the streets of an area he's never been to before, Jordan directs them straight to a small brown house and proclaims that ?┬¼someone here knows what happened to Tom.' Detectives are blown away ' they're well aware of who lives there. TV-PGV

Originally aired 8/1/07

The Fresno Police Department receives a frantic call from a 
woman saying her stepson, Steven Brown, has disappeared 
from a crowded store. Police quickly scour the immediate 
area but find no trace of the boy. Fearing the worst, a frightened 
community joins in the search. Friends and neighbors plaster 
the area with missing person posters and police officers comb 
surrounding fields, ponds, rivers, and abandoned houses. 
Running out of time and with no leads, police turn to psychic 
Kay Rhea for help. Rhea hears a high pitched whistle, running 
water and believes Steven is dead. If her disturbing visions are 
correct, police should actually be looking for a killer.
