,phatman808,2008-05-07T16:43Z,"This torrent is fuckin' sweet! Thanks Worelon and to anyone else involved in ripping the tracks to mp3.

As for the people who are bitching about seeders, your connection sucks! My download took about 20 minutes. There are plenty of seeders.

Listening to this music is part of sticking it to the Man. Next is taking action on the ideas presented in the music."
,Sebihoorens,2008-05-12T21:47Z,Nice...

,SnipinTerminator,2008-06-09T23:45Z,"Saw them live on Pinkpop Festival 2008!! Maybe not their best performance ever, but the crowd just went crazy, everyone pushing eachother, jumping, crowdsurfing etc. All in all one of the best shows of the festivals, and that's why I really recommend everone who doesn't know this band: Check it out and don't miss theit next live performance!

(ow, yeah, watch the quality of this torrent, rock music doesn't sound good (read: awfull) when compressed. Don't believe me? Test it out :). Or try to hear the difference between the clips http://mp3ornot.com (not rock so harder to hear the difference))"
,Biowolfer,2008-06-22T08:35Z,Thanks!!!!

[T],HackShackJack,2008-07-22T14:51Z,"Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine semi combined to form AudioSlave, don't miss then either....  We should come out with a group and call it FUCK THE SYSTEM!"
,omahamusic,2008-08-02T00:08Z,"if you like rage against the machine, you should check out ""one day as a lion"". it is a group featuring zack de la rocha (ratm's vocalist) and the drummer from the mars volta."
,paranjk,2008-08-02T17:09Z,"hats off to u man

Now someone get Tom Morello to rape a guitar with a razor dildo and we got ourselves a new Rage single."
,shadymilkman,2008-09-04T05:05Z,"LightTheRebellion, you are obviously an ignorant piece of shit. Go listen to some emo music, you dumb bitch."
,65chvlrydr,2008-09-08T18:17Z,"Hey all you ""stick it to the man"" diarrhea mouths-- talk is cheaper than your mamas ass.. Get up, contact your reps and sens, vote for change...PS, You RATM gives a shit about healthcare reform or you???"
,TheMasquedDeath,2008-09-12T09:50Z,"You know what RATM once said? Lemme quote:

""They're not afraid of four musicians from Los Angeles who speak their minds, oh no....they're afraid of you.""

So, shut it up with your ""Think they worry about healthcare?""

Yeah, they do. Hell they do. Any reasonable dude would. RATM just gives us a voice. And you bet I'd support that."
,conxvi,2008-09-17T00:52Z,taking forever to download - cant wait though it looks awesome!
,StarofTroy,2008-09-26T22:06Z,Rage abandon us during the hardest of the Bush years. I hope this One Day as Lions thing goes somewhere.
,Lovalin,2008-09-27T08:19Z,"@HackShackJack:
There was a band called Fuck the System. They failed horribly. 'Cause they sucked."

,Corpse742,2008-11-20T16:18Z,You Know some Of You Fucking People Are So Dumb.....If You care about the sound quality so much just download one of the many programs that make the quality better....If your downloading the music free you cant complain....PLus you can get the software free from this same site....
,fuzzyballs84,2008-11-20T16:44Z,You know I was thinking about something. Everyone that says we're dumb for caring about quality.... All you have to do is push the rip button. The computer does the rest. So long story short.... quit being lazy and up some good quality. You have to push the mouse a couple of times but after that workout you should be ok. lol
,xplicit___0ne,2008-11-23T00:14Z,RATM rules! thanks a lot!
,ebolateralus,2008-12-18T14:58Z,"just to put this out there for folks like 65chvlrydr

,MASK.13,2008-12-29T15:03Z,"Wow. @LightTheRebellion and 65chvlydr, GO FUCK YOURSELVES! @All the cool people around here, good torrent, don't be too picky about the quality and your fine. I think I'll go check out this ""One Day As A Lion"" I've heard about on here, and while your reading this, check out System of a Down too, very kickass group, just a shame they broke up..."
,Fyerfox,2009-01-14T04:35Z,"Great torrent, you might want to think about ripping music is 320 kb/ps, but still. Fast dl, great music, thanks alot Worelon."
,SquirlMan,2009-02-01T03:26Z,"Mehhh. Poor bitrate averaging 177kbps over the entire collection.  Inconsistent and occasionally incorrect metadata. 

All that aside I am glad to have the music. 

Also the Iron Maiden cover ""The Troopers""  is done by the German metal band Rage not Rage Against the Machine, just thought I would point that out.
"
,Hobosogo,2009-02-09T05:53Z,"thanks for the upload, and light the rebellion is a douche... but that was pretty funny."
,Hobosogo,2009-02-09T05:55Z,"also listening to rage doesn't make you a good person, the music should inspire you to make a difference."
,Spiderwebber,2009-02-10T21:55Z,RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE KICKS FUCKING ASS! and if you dont think so get the fuck away from this torrent
,RawSnake,2009-03-19T21:45Z,"Thanks for this1 Worelon and those seeding, 1 mb/sec constant."

,rohagymeg,2009-07-10T06:20Z,"Hello all and thanks for the torrent Worelon! Just wanted to say that there are a lot of bad peers on this torrent in other words right holder suckers, so they want to kill the swarm. Please use ipfilter.dat, so you will only seed this for REAL peers and not for bots. And also set ban threshold to 1 from 3 so your bandwidth will not be wasting on the peers sending bad data."

,raefaybro,2010-05-22T23:01Z,hey this torrent downloaded slow even with the 300+ seeders and now its saying that the torrent downloaded was missing files and so it stopped at 90.1%... so far its been a major pain in the ass. if any1 can tell if I was the 1 that screwed up the download id like it
,ReallyNotReallyHere,2010-10-12T11:55Z,"LOL rage fans glorify the band's ability to speak their minds and opinions freely through their music, yet they give lighttherebelion shit for speaking his own opinion. that being said though: a comment like that on a pro RATM page is just asking for it."
,leslieianramos,2010-10-12T12:22Z,thanks dude! 2 thumbs up!
,AIDS69,2010-10-28T10:31Z,Nice upload man.... Thanks a million
,FRDS,2010-11-14T04:32Z,"Well someone fucked up the torrent.


Been sitting between 92 and 99% for the past 10 minutes. Gotten at least 300 hash check fails."
,Counselor1130,2010-12-23T02:24Z,"Torrent is a little disorganized, but I'm sure Zach would approve of that. D'ld at nearly 3 MB/s the whole time/

@ReallyNotReallyHere People have the right to say whatever they want, but it's disrespectful and deliberate to do that shit here on a Rage DOWNLOAD comment area.

If you hate Rage go find an ""I hate RATM"" forum, have a discussion with your fellow corporatist freedom haters, and then sodomize yourself to death."

,SrMLove,2012-06-12T04:31Z,@StarofTroy: Zach left for his own personal reasons. rage didnt do anything to you nor did it have anything to do with bush. do your research dipshit.  
,SrMLove,2012-06-12T04:37Z,"@omahamusic: good look man... zach is one of best musicians/vocalist out there. and the drummer from the mars volta was the youngest one ever to graduate from the music college that he attended. RATM and the mars volta are extremely good artists. if you like mars volta some of their members use to be in ""at the drive in"" ... they are more punk than the mars volta sound."
,Harakiri_,2012-08-03T01:33Z,Awesome stuff
