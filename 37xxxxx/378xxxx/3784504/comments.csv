Thanks anyway."
,MrSvisse,2007-08-26T08:44Z,Can you upload the dvdcovers?
,ekansehtekaj,2007-08-26T10:17Z,"UnchosenOne:

I quite agree. Normally when DVDs are released on the Nordic market English subtexts are kept and the Nordic ones just added. I somehow suspect that there weren't any English subs even on the BBC original release - it's a pity - for non-English, like me, Eng subs are a good help when you're learning the language.
If you still want English subs and don't mind working a bit for them, maybe rebuilding the DVDs, you can get them from, for instance , http://www.podnapisi.net/

MrSvisse:

Good question. I'll try scanning the box I have (no individual DVD covers though) and maybe even scan the discs."
