,sunshine__,2007-08-26T12:41Z,It gave me VIRUS! :@
,Chill001,2007-08-26T18:38Z,Yepp... F-secure says it's virus. Do not download!
,rokushadows,2007-09-01T20:14Z,"There is a setup installer which contains a trojan. The RSE packs are clean so feel free to download it without risk. Just don't intall the one with the name like ""setup""."
,Fruside,2007-09-04T20:21Z,I Foud a virus to with my anti-spyware 
,bourretapipe,2007-09-14T10:41Z,"Extracting Setup.exe gives 2 files : setup.exe + cpk.exe (aspacked).
cpk.exe ?"
,bourretapipe,2007-09-14T12:08Z,"Tested ;-)

cpk.exe install the ""comsysapp"" process and create a .bat to delete itself.
XP boot normally but with the 15 meg ""commsysapp.pif"" process loaded.
Vista failed to load with a message like ""defining parameters for comsysapp.pif"".

Avast doesn't detect anything :( 
Vista does ;-)

So it's not a bad download IF you :
 - Extract Setup.exe
 - Delete cpk.exe
 - Use the extracted setup.exe. This one is safe. Delete the old one."
