You kill Ryan midway through the game, only to find out Atlas/Fontaine manipulated you to do it.
Your player's past is a fake memory, you were made in a lab to do everything said to you when added ""...would you kindly...""
That's why you kill Ryan.
Oh, and at the end, you get to be a big daddy.

The two endings are; you raise all the little sisters into adulthood, or you kill em all for the Adam."

,The_Techno_Lover,2007-08-27T22:28Z,"ey watch the mouth, it's not fake... it just nuked... 'cuz you need the avtivation key, fint that and play the game and tell us"
,Lardzor,2007-08-27T22:59Z,"My understanding is that a key is generated using information about your computer. This includes information like hardware serial numbers if I'm not mistaken.  So even cookie cutter computers from Dell, or some other place will require diffent codes if they have any hardware that reports it's serial number. 
It sends the key to the 2K servers wher an activation code is calculated for your specific computer.  Since the cracking groups can not directly examine how the codes are calculated, they will have to compile a database of working keys and codes to reverse enginere a keygen.

More likely, some group will just figure out how to exclude the activation checks from a post installed verion and produce a crack or possibly a complete 6GB release with a custom installer.
 Just my two cents."
,Melldorwin,2007-08-28T13:13Z,"ive just completed the whole game.. worth bying if you ask me.. i did.. :) .. nice metal casing and everything.. worth the buy!!! play it in vista (DX10) whole new experience with the graphics.
