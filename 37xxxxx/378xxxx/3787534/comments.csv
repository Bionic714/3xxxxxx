,CujoDeSoque,2008-11-09T16:45Z,I'm at 99.4. This is a shame. It's only a couple of MB. any chance someone could open this up for a half hour or so?
,Bjellesau,2009-05-13T21:05Z,"Thanks to the reseeder for completing this torrent, and to the original uploader (double thanks)"
,lowephato,2010-06-07T06:05Z,"I'm sorry that I didn't thank you until now, but I hate joining these things just to say, ""thank you.""  I wish that they just had a ""thank you"" button like some of them have.  Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that this is the most professional torrent I have ever downloaded.  I didn't have to do anything but add the files to iTunes.  The covers were close to perfection; the tracks were labelled correctly, as far as I can tell; and the scans were perfectly level.  Great job and thank you again."
