
Yet another interesting history tv show based upon Hitler. This one is to document his escapes from assassination and eventually his suicide. The show starts off with a history lesson on how the political parties were forming in the late 1930s and what certain factors and events led to the rise of the fascist dictatorship where all opposers were eliminated. It then goes on to document the assassination attempts on Hitler?s life.
