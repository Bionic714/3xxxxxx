This is the finale show... all 82 minutes of it ... very glad we don't have comercials or it would have been 120 minutes 
This is for all who have become hooked on the show but can no longer view it thanks to CBS 
Now we'll see if Jay can really rule the ship or does Christa really "have the boys by the balls"... or perhaps Ben will surprise us with something to win this thing... finally we see who is the "pirate master" 
Again it is in four segments as this is how it was directly downloaded from CBS and in the interest of speed (getting it to you quickly) and preserving the very good video quality of the files - I didn't join them... mainly because I haven't had time to figure out how to yet 
Anyway... Enjoy all!! 

 Please remember to seed for others to enjoy
