,gremlin1812,2008-08-21T05:53Z,"Hi nightmoods, got your thomas rolling stock for msts and they are great although have not tried them all. My 5yo boy loves it but he keers asking where is sodor and have been searching for a sodor route with no success. you say you have a route for thomas would it be possible to get it as it would make the boys day or even year for that matter.
hoping you can help out here, thanks."

,UPSTATENY,2010-02-15T22:41Z,"This is a pretty stupid question - and I'm pretty sure I know the answer - but will this work on a Mac? My son would love something like this and whenever I do come across a game that seems interesting, rarely will it work for Macs.  And I'm not about to buy that Parallel program just so I can run Windows as well.

Oh, and I is it just me or what?  I get all this ""Thomas"" junk for my son, of course, but the main reason is so I don't go insane.  I can only take so much of this Thomas stuff!"
