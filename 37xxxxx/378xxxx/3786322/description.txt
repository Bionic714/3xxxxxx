Though her finger as never been on the trigger, there are those who believe Liberty Wallace is guilty of murder. An international arms dealer, she sells to anyone who's got the connections and the cash...no questions asked.
En route to a secret rendezvous to meet her lover, Liberty answers her mobile phone. The caller tells Liberty he has her in his sights and unless she does exactly as she's told, she'll die in a hail of bullets.
Not only that. If her line goes dead, she'll detonate a bomb killing her and blowing a whole city block sky high. Powerless to stop time running out on her phone, the passing of each second takes her and countless innocent victums one step closer to oblivion.
