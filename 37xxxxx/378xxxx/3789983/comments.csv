You don't need to burn, just read the installation instructions."

,BD1965,2007-10-21T22:40Z,"nospam9:

i tested with norton 2007 with latest definitions, no report of anything at all, whatever scaner you are using it's wrong, what you got is a false warning."

,BD1965,2008-04-27T14:43Z,"Jesperos:

You don't need to mount anything,
just run NCDSTART.exe. Good luck."
,mosmooth,2011-08-28T22:59Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD! DANGER!!!!!!

The zip file is infected with Infostealer.Gampass virus. I checked the zip files with Norton Systemworks Premier 2007 AV scanner-and it resolved the threat by removing all the files."
,mosmooth,2011-08-28T23:42Z,I have a clean copy of this and will upload the torrent asap.
,mosmooth,2011-08-31T01:58Z,"CORRECTION-Norton anti virus detected the Keygen.exe as Infostealer Gampass-but it also did it to Edge's Keygen.exe too-a copy I know is perfectly clean: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4942971/Norton_SystemWorks_Premier_2008_v11.0.0.67_[EDGE]-[RH] 

The Keygen is seen as a virus by Norton (a false positive report.) APOLOGIES FOR MY ERROR. THIS COPY IS LIKELY FINE TOO.

Again, apologies to the uploader BD1965."
