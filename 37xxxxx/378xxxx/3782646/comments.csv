,semperaude,2007-08-24T09:27Z,"No, its a leaked version of the cheat happens one:
http://www.cheathappens.com/lockedcontent.asp?date=Sep%2018,%202007&chtid=23078
Tho you have to pay $15 to sign up to get access to it.

Works fine on mine."
,semperaude,2007-08-24T09:30Z,"And also I've just sent it to Gameburnworld, Megagames and put it on a few other torrent sites.
Gameburnworld has the ""promo"" version of this trailer (Unlimited reload ammo only). This one's the full version of it."

,bmxjuh,2010-03-27T06:56Z,"this is for the first Bioshock game, version v1.0.0.0

you have to first start Bioshock the game, then after the game is loaded (when your character is inside the game), THEN press Alt+Tab to return to windows and start this trainer.

after you start the trainer, return back to game, and press the numbers on the numpad accordingly, make sure the Num-Lock is on.

READ the txt file.

it works fine for me, thank you for sharing."
