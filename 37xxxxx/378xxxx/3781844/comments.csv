,zig,2007-08-23T09:47Z,Does it work with WiiKey?
,Stephoon,2007-08-24T09:06Z,It's only one who I could see that has 100% of the game downloaded (probably dmwzd). Sins the speed is really slow and many are stucked -> Please reduce the slots for upload clients (Max 4 slots for uploaders) if you have low band width and these who are connected will help seeding as well. It will be faster over all.
,Stephoon,2007-08-25T21:50Z,To dmwzd. Thanks for this nice upload. But could you reduce your seed slots to 3 or max 4 so the upload to these persons connected will be faster. These people will then help distributing to others and download will be much faster.
