He is from south africa what do you expect?  THEY are all like that... ya you know what I am talking about marktman1.  Just look in a mirror.  Trying to make money off people for stolen software is WORSE then the jerks who are asking too much for it in the first place.  Its too bad AIDS didn't finish off you people.

If you plan on paying for unlock codes buy them from garmin, if not there are plenty of free keygens out there, use one of those.  Don't pay this pile of shit a dime."
