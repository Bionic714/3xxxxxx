Electronica for Sociopaths

Artist: Hopeful Machines
Album: Doom
Release: December 2005

A collection of demos written for a unused modification for Doom 3.

These were written very quickly and are somewhat rough around the edges. They are fun, and over the top, which is why they are included here.
