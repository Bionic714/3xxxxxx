Not a dead ringer for the cd's, I apologize, but it is an audio book, not a listening cd... i hope you enjoy and please leave some feedback!"

,senshisteph,2008-08-26T21:26Z,"Thanks ever so much for this, I've been smoking since I was 19 (am 32 now) and it's high time I quit. I work with kids and don't want to be a bad example to them - plus I want to keep on being able to race round the playground and not have the multiple colds I get from the little buggers every year turn into bronchitis by the end of the winter! Nicotine replacement does nothing for me, and I've heard lots of good things about this book. Thanks again!"
