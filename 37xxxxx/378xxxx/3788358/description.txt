From the Editorial description at Amazon.com:

A new edition of the revolutionary bestseller, with four million copies in print. Allen CarrÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s innovative Easyway methodÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½which he discovered after his own 100-cigarette-a-day habit nearly drove him to despairÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½has helped millions kick smoking without feeling anxious and deprived. ThatÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s because he helps smokers discover the psychological reasons behind their dependency, explains in detail how to handle the withdrawal symptoms, shows them how to avoid situations when temptation might become too strong, and enables them to stay smoke-free. Carr discusses such issues as nicotine addiction; the social Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½brainwashingÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ that encourages smoking; the false belief that a cigarette relieves stress; the role boredom plays in sabotaging efforts to stop; and the main reasons for failure. With this proven program, smokers will be throwing away their packs for good.


This is the audio program that I used to quit smoking. Carr does not belittle you, smash you over the head with information you already know, or tell you to cut back while doing the program. Instead he uses the most powerful weapon of all: your own mind. With it he reminds us of the greatness of being a non-smoker. I hope that you find it as useful as I did and please *gently* recommend it to your smoking friends.
