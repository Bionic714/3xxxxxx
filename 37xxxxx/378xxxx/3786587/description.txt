Plot: the story is settled in the English country in 1694. Lady Herbert  asks  Mr. Neville to execute 12 drawings of the estate (Compton House). They are supposed to be a present for the husband when he will be back, on the purpose of making peace with him. The artist asks to be rewarded with sexual services from the lady and the details are written in a proper contract. He starts working and imposes severe limitations to the activities that can be performed in the estate when he is at work. But, in spite of  this, , the locations he is reproducing change mysteriously, things appear in the wrong places at the wrong moments and nothing seems to be as it would. He makes a point of registering things without adjustments and, so proceeding, he includes in his drawings details that could be red as clues for the discovery of embarrassing secrets, maybe even a murder. A body is actually found. Miss Herbert\'s daughter, married to a spiteful, sexually impaired and far from attractive German gentleman, has meanwhile stipulated herself a contract with Mr. Neville at conditions not very different than her mother\'s ones. The artist appears to master everything with his intelligence and rationality but things are working in different unpredictable ways and everybody around him maybe has his own planes.   

  This is an intriguing, deliberately not realistic movie, with beautiful scenery, sophisticated and amusing dialogs and bizarre inventions. It displays oddly an intricate net of symbols; nevertheless their correct interpretation is not a condition for enjoying it. Sometimes all the symbolic, allegoric equipment is maybe more deceiving than explicative and in certain moments appears a bit redundant. But it is nice to orientate ourselves or to get lost among the fragments of this puzzle, explore, successfully or not, all the possible meanings and the reasons why those strange things happen, as it was a thriller. Though this is a work very carefully and thoughtfully conceived, where very little is casual, our mind is free to follow its own paths and develop at leisure the provocative material that this movie provides. Or just enjoy the intelligent, original and entertaining show as well as Nyman music, especially the false-baroque leading theme. Great performance of Anthony Higgins. Excuse me for my English, which maybe is far more bizarre than this movie, I am Italian. This is my first upload,  I hope that everything will go well and that you will like this torrent.
