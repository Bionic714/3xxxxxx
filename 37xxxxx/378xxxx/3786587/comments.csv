Compressing a movie into .RAR files, .IMG files, etc etc, as so many uploaders seem to like is such a waste of time.  Absolutely nothing can be gained by compressing a movie that is already compressed using the highly efficient MPEG4 compression utilized by DVD movies.   Again - thanks."

,sarrip,2007-08-28T15:29Z,"Thank you so much for the comments and for inserting the imbd (though it reports, strangely, that it is a Swedish and not British movie). I have ""Drowning by numbers (""Giochi sull'acqua"" for my cowntrymen), but I did not check so far if the fulldvd version is already available in this site. If it may be usefull I'll upoload it, but give me some time. (No compressing is good and it is an act of respect for good cinema, but it implies that you have to seed for a lot of time and sacrifice most of your bradband which is needed for other purposes, too.)"
,Karl Mundt,2007-08-29T15:40Z,Thanks a lot for this upload. Any Greenaway film is very welcomed.
,ranapuree,2008-02-01T14:04Z,Please please please! If you have 'Drowning by Numbers' it is my favourite movie ever. I've been looking everywhere for it !! 
,madhatter106,2008-03-19T18:53Z,"Oh, do post a torrent for ""Drowning by Numbers,"" it's a favorite movie of mine and stupidly is not availabe on DVD in the US...I'd greatly appreciate it!"
,sarrip,2008-03-24T00:26Z,"O.K., look for it in ten /fifteeen days by now, some triubles at present."
,sarrip,2008-03-24T00:27Z,"Triubles= troubles, alas!"
,Musicatore,2009-11-08T17:06Z,"this torrent this must be some kind of a joke

the video quality of this shitty release makes my eyes hurt"
,IanW,2011-06-09T03:25Z,"Musicatore is a clueless troll.  This was originally filmed on 16mm and transferred to 35mm for release.  It was subsequently converted for dvd by the BFI.

The quality is a good as it gets.  Thanks to the uploader.

Just need to find a copy of the 4 hour version now."
