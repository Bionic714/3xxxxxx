,blueluck,2007-09-02T20:31Z,"I love old school punk, the kind that came with an attitude you couldn't find anywhere else except a vacant lot.  But now ""punk"" is a genre of music labeled and sold by music companies just like any other.  Before punk, rock was outlaw; before rock, jazz was outlaw; before jazz, waltz was outlaw - it's an old old story that genres either get adopted by the mainstream or die out, and that the early adopters look down on the next generation.  The fact that you're offended by the new use of the word ""punk"" just means that you're getting old. (like me)"
,DistructOMan,2007-09-11T23:55Z,"most these bands arent even punk, but you pricks saying pop-punk isnt punk are stupid.

pop-""PUNK"""

,keisa,2007-12-09T07:32Z,"yeah I see a few bands here that i wouldn't personally consider punk. but some where in their list if shit they did something that made someone consider them punk and book 'em with punk act. after all. labels don't book us when were playing backyards.

to paraphrase cock sparrer.  what do we have to fight against in the music industry. punks got what they wanted. they even said they liked greenday. so srsly who gives a fuck about these old punk elitist.  

i stress ""old"" punk. time brings change.

get bent. dl & seed. or toss off"

,becknasty,2008-11-03T22:12Z,I agree with burftoo. This music is shit. Not punk at all.
,Stumpeone,2009-08-09T07:56Z,"Some of it is punk, some of it is punk-ish, and some is not punk at all. If you can honestly say pennywise isn't punk, than you don't think bad religion is punk because that is who they think they are. If you dont think bad religion is punk than you're just an idiot."
,xxxddd,2009-09-10T17:19Z,"HAHAH xD Punkrock?? U gotta be kidding.....
