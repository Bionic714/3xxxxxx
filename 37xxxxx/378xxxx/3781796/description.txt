Opposites attract with irresistible force in this fresh, funny, feel-good comedy about two mismatched teens who scheme to make their ex's jealous. Melissa Joan Hart (TV's Sabrina the Teenage Witch) is "picture perfect" (CBS-TV, FORT WORTH) as a peppy preppy who performs the ultimate makeover on her scruffy next-door neighbor (Adrian Grenier) and discovers this former "frog" was really a prince all along! With a screenplay by Rob Thomas (Dawson's Creek) a cast featuring today's hottest young stars, plus the hit singles "Crazy" (Britney Spears), and "I Want It That Way" (Backstreet Boys), Drive Me Crazy is "worth celebrating!"
