,tyler91690,2007-08-28T00:35Z,"Sup dopeman, I know you probly have a shit load of requests as it is but you seem to know your stuff about coding and everything >< why not give this bioshock CRACK  a try, not the whole game just the crack. Your a god among torrent uploaders lol keep going !!"
,n10city,2007-08-28T06:19Z,I commented on your complete game download but my comment didn't show up so hopefully it'll work here. I just want to know if I can just download the most recent update once I get the game or do I have to install all the updates in succession?
,kostolomach,2007-08-28T14:15Z,"thx for this dopeman. i see you put radeon launcher in too, excellent. thx again =D"
,Gyakuto,2007-08-29T19:34Z,"Does anyone have a link to Razor Keygen?
Cause I can find only one, wich sadly contains a virus...
Or can someone just post a serial with the accescode that belongs to it?"
,n10city,2007-08-29T23:43Z,"so um... is anyone getting this error when trying to run the .exe after setting up the registry: ""This application has failed to start because X3DAudio1_1.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem."" I have been reading about people having sound issues, but I haven't even been able to get into the game, this just pops up."
,n10city,2007-08-29T23:46Z,"um yeah cancel what I just wrote, I read over some comments and saw what I was looking for thanks."
,Nomadski,2007-08-31T11:06Z,GJ Dopeman. Appreciated.

,xShadyImagex,2007-09-02T22:09Z,"**QUESTION 2 Anyone who knows the answer**

Okay.. I'm usually good at installing games.. cracks.. warez.. ect. but I just DONT get this... I have followed all of Dopeman's instructions... I've installed the game, copied and pasted the updates in the game folder and all that.. installed VC++, PhysX.... It took me a while to get PhysX installed but I finally did.. I'm using Windows Vista Ultimate (if it matters). Anyways, So I finally do all of this, and then I get an error saying ""Game isnt properly installed. Please reinstall program."" I'm not complaining because all of this is free, but it's just it's really frustrating and it's been a couple days... I really wanna play this game. Thanks for takin the time reading this. Hope someone knows what I need to do.. Thanks.."
,xShadyImagex,2007-09-02T23:46Z,lol dang... noone knows?? That's disappointing..
,siebe05,2007-09-03T18:36Z,Why do you have to have all the other patches?
,death77777,2007-09-06T03:47Z,"ok guys i was having the same problem so here goes

1. intall VC++
2. PhysX
3. make sure u hav windows media player  
    update 11 will do to make sure u hav sound and  video check the video file and try and run it if it runs good without and glitches then u r good to go
4. get the crack 1.2 hacked patch and unzip or winrar which ever u want to use make sure u place it in side the same folder where all your 2 worlds r don't make any new folders for just use the same folder
5. run the regsetup and place it in the same 2 worlds folder and don't make any new 1 to place it in (i think that is why most people get the blank screen) then run the 2 worlds exe and u should see the logo pops up 
6. this is the most important part is too just have patience it takes a couple of minutes to load up 
7. that should do it  hope that helps all of you gys out that where having trouble with the game 
8. enjoy and good luck
5. "
,death77777,2007-09-06T03:49Z,sry gys forgot to tell u to install or run the WM9 it will tell this is not compatible but don't worry like i said just try and run the video file and see if that works
,rambakjamba,2007-09-07T16:37Z,"can any1 help me?  my computer can run this game and all, but when i start the game, i only get the Two Worlds  logo and it stops there?

anything i have missed or done wrong?"
,kragus7,2007-09-08T04:49Z,"Hope this helps someone, I was getting a black screen which would never load. I am using Vista Ultimate. After a few trials this is what worked for me on Windows Vista.

1. Install latest DirectX 9.0c (I am using August 2007)
2. Unrar Two Worlds
3. run setup.reg
4. run regsetup.exe
5. Only install PhysX driver of the optional extras.
#(not Visual C++, as I think Vista already has this to run the sidebar) & 
##(not WM9, as on Vista you can't, because it is only for earlier windows and Vista uses WM11)
*Just uninstall Visual C++ if you have, I did in the middle of trying.
6. Unrar Updates in order.
7. I then uninstalled Two Worlds (regsetup.exe -using Control Panel Add Remove)
8. run setup.reg again
9. run regsetup.exe again
*Those last three steps may be unnecessary but this worked for me.

Load the Game and use keygen.
**Also - game still took about a full minuite to load."
,kragus7,2007-09-08T05:01Z,"One more thing - I also had Ageia PhysX running in the system tray by running the link from the Start menu - before I loaded the game

*Note for XP users: when I ran this on XP earlier this year I had to install All of the optional extras."
,xeroy,2007-09-10T03:56Z,THANK U SO MUCH DEATH7777 UR AWESOME... yay thanks alot man.. i really appreciate it.
,Slixor,2007-09-11T21:43Z,"NO IN GAME SOUND   RESOLVED!!

upon patching many people complain there is no sound in game .....

go to your install directory and check ""two worlds\XACT\WIN"" .....  notice you only have a single eax file and a folder???

go to your orignal zip file of the game and extract the contents of ""two worlds\XACT\WIN"" into the ""two worlds\XACT\WIN"" folder of your install directory    DONT OVERWRITE THE EAX FILE"
,Zoltar26,2007-09-13T21:45Z,"Hi 
Well, ladies and gentlemen, here is how to enter
the serial with the keygen after realizing the little
catch (ohhh those developers had definitely used
a smart technic to trick everyone's mind):
1) Install the game.
2) Apply the 1.5 patch (You don't have to patch
    the earlier ones).
3) Open Razor's keygen (there's already a serial
    key in it but you may generate a new one).
4) Make sure your ""Caps Lock"" key is off.
5) Launch the game, and you will be presented
    to enter the serial.
6) Click on ""Alt"" + ""Tab"" keys to switch off the
    game and look on the first 4 serial characters
    in the keygen.
7) Get into the game again and type them in the
    first frame. now listen to me very carefully:
    When you try to do the same with the next
    4 serial characters the cursor inside the next 
    frame will try sometimes to deceive you and
    won't let you type the next 4 characters in one 
    single frame, the cursor will actually jump to 
    the next frame (this is a developers trick to 
    let you think the serial you are entering is 
    wrong). in this situation go back to the frame
    from which the cursor jumped off and try to 
    move the keyboard cursor to the most left 
    side of the frame and retype again the 
    remaining serial characters or try to type
    some ""blabla"" in the next frame and go back 
    to the previous frame (where the cursor 
    jumped off) and again move the cursor to the 
    most left side of the frame and retype the 
    next serial characters in order. just play with 
    the keyboard cursor inside the serial frames
    in the game in order to type it correctly.
8) After that you will get the activation code
    which you have to type inside the keygen
    in order to get the access serial and that's all.
9) Have fun."

,krille__1986,2007-10-15T03:49Z,"can't get it to work wrong code, wrong code...damn, tired of playing the xbox 360 version."
,corgae,2007-10-16T15:59Z,Oh rly? This Release is kinda of undated. This crap dosen't work with a pirate copy of this game. This really sucks. So Dopeman remove this crap. The Razor keygen doesen't work longer. And after all this game is the buggiest ive played after big rigs ;)
,Kaaane,2007-12-30T01:52Z,"Hey / tjenare. I have this problem, which might be quite a nooby one. When i extract the patchfiles to the folder, it says it cant overwrite. Im using Vista home edition, how can I do to overwrite the files anyway? "

,Olly9000,2009-09-06T16:24Z,"I had no in game sound as well, I figured out how to fix it though, the patch wont help at all, you need to download a different version of direct x probably the latest one although on xp lots of people reckon the april version worked but im on Vista and it worked me"
