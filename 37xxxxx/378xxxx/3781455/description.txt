Plot: Director Bob Fosse's dramatic biopic chronicling the short life and career of controversial stand-up comedian Lenny Bruce (Dustin Hoffman) was nominated for seven Academy Awards. Capturing Bruce's complex character, the film traces the comedian from his beginnings as a Catskills comic to his rising popularity, his courting of Honey Bruce (Valerie Perrine), his anti-establishment politics and the humor that put him at odds with obscenity laws.
