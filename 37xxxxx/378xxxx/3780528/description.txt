Sublime was an American band that originated in Long Beach, California. Sublime consisted of three members: Brad Nowell (vocals and guitar), Bud Gaugh (drums), and Eric Wilson (bass guitar). The band achieved major mainstream success with their self-titled third album; however, Nowell died of a heroin overdose shortly before it was released, and the band ceased to exist. The band is still considered quite influential today. Worldwide, Sublime has sold 17 million albums.

Greatest Hits is the first of Sublime's compilation albums released after frontman Bradley Nowell's death. It was released in 1999.
