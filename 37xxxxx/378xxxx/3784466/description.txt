The complete discography of Hopeful Machines, who makes
Electronica for Sociopaths to download for free. Their 
web site is a bit slow to download from, so here's a nice
torrent of everything.

From hopefulmachines.net:

---------------------------------------------------------
My name is Steven, Hopeful Machines is my audio sandbox.
It exists for developing ideas, learning production 
techniques, and my own amusement.

The albums are free, take them.
If you would like to support the cause,
my email is on the contact page, I take paypal.

After your done poking around here,
please check out my other project Ego Likeness.
Its dark, its got guitar, and a seriously hot chick singer.
