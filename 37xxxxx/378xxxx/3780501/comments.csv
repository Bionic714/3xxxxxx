,rhmelis,2007-11-20T21:17Z,Thanks for compiling and posting!!
,Poke,2008-01-01T18:08Z,Great but not complete missing a few pieces here and there.
,CaptainBeefheart314,2008-01-19T23:10Z,"Great??? Allow me to correct your enthusiasm! First of all: missing a few pieces here and there, is the most ridiculous understatement of the new Age... An enormous amount of incomplete albums, and of course every time the ones I really wanted to be complete. And what to think of a seeder who plant 4Gigs of music without even trying to edit the ID3 tags??? I spent more then a day correcting all of them, and finally erased the incomplete albums too: My 4 gigs is now down to slightly over half that, SHAME ON YOU!!! Wanna be a seeder? LEAVE OUT THE BULLSHIT, AND SEED QUALITY FOR ONCE!"

Well, then perhaps you should go out and BUY THE ALBUMS YOU WANT, you cheap ungrateful bastard!  The Residents could use your support.  I would suggest to anyone who enjoys this music, go to The Residents' online store RalphAmerica.com and purchase a disc or two!  They have given us an incredible amount of music and art over the past 35+ years, so why not thank them by dropping $15 or $20 on their latest release?"
,Merkaba7,2008-02-07T19:45Z,Agree 100% with bobert-bobert. If you can support the band buying his albums (=
,DARK X,2008-03-25T02:47Z,"Merkaba7, thanks a lot on this one. I'm really grateful.
CaptainBeefheart314, you slimy piece of spearm... This torrent wasn't rar or zip filed, you could have chosen which songs you wanted to download and which not. You didn't have to download all 4 GIB... Ohhh, you stupid, stupid fuckface dick... May you spend eternity rotting in huge horse shit."
,p3on,2009-03-04T07:34Z,"im gonna agree with beefheart, if youre gonna make a torrent at least put some effort into it"
,ClTIZEN,2010-01-27T10:00Z,"beefheart, you cheap fuck, go out and buy the albums if you don't like what is on here, someone spent a long time compiling this and is sharing it with us for free, if you don't like it, you have NO RIGHT to whine like a little bitch, may you be eternally doomed to the darkest depths of deepest hell, you piece of slime"
,hlopchikk,2010-02-02T12:45Z,"Im love this music !!!
Its  different world"
,gropecunt,2010-02-16T16:53Z,"I really appreciate this, it's a huge collection, probably 60% of what The Residents have produced. It even includes The Warner Bros Album. Thanks for this Merkaba. That said, I really wish people would learn to tag their files properly. I've been working all day trying to get the tags straight and I've still got a lot of work ahead of me. And to those saying just go out and buy it: Some of this stuff isn't for sale, e.g. The Warner Bros Album. Also, I'm dirt poor, I don't buy CDs because I can't afford to."

this made me laugh soooo hard! but seriously, i totally agree with this and with what ClTIZEN said. you wanna know the best way to get things done your way? DO IT YOUR OWN DAMN SELF! im sure Merkaba7 spent a shitton of time finding all this music."
,Sov42,2010-06-09T20:01Z,Troll much?
,pumiceee,2010-06-14T20:01Z,"hey! amazing stuff!
thank you very much!"
,Tibbleton,2010-08-11T21:56Z,"This is a really wonderful upload. I've been a big fan of The Residents for years. Thank you for this addition and thank you too, seeders! "
,dudemanbro2011,2011-07-07T09:28Z,"It took both torrents & a month of searching, but I had maybe 95% & alot of bootlegs.
I owned at least half of the collection on CD.

I had to sell my CD collection to pay the bills.
And now my HD that had it all. died.

So does anyone have the files from that other ""lesser quality"" torrent? The one where not one of the track files were labeled? The combination of that & this torrent was alot closer to 100%
I agree with gropecunt, this is maybe 60%.

Or if you are on soulseek, i'm under dudemanbro33"
,libertinagrim,2011-09-22T14:25Z,seed please.
,Liliedugg,2011-11-24T16:17Z,"Thank you so much, Merkaba7 !!"
,wyattdd,2012-05-06T04:18Z,mental! thanks so much
