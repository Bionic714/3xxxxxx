,credington,2007-08-21T13:10Z,Because I've got limited bandwidth I've stopped uploading Dragons Lair 1 but there should be plenty of seeders for that - so if you are a seeder of it and you have the capacity please keep it alive. Thanks.
,Cain303,2007-08-21T17:54Z,Thanks!
,Kingcheeze,2007-09-08T06:13Z,Thanks a lot for the upload! This brings me back to the old arcade days. I pumped many a quarter trying to beat the first one. I got that one from you as well. Thanks for the memories!
,Kingcheeze,2007-09-10T22:29Z,I'm also stuck at 98%. A couple more seeders would be nice. I'll seed once It's done. I Can't wait to play this!
,credington,2007-09-11T22:32Z,I'm seeding but only in evenings and weekends GMT. You'll get there. When you get it YOU need to keep seeding too!
,spystyle,2008-02-18T18:17Z,Is it possible to use this with Daphne emulator?
,skywalka,2008-05-26T09:28Z,I loaned the box set to someone & never saw them again.  Thanx 4 these credington.  Still chasing Space Ace though.
,metalic37,2008-07-06T21:27Z,"ok first of all the game downloaded fine and i burned it as a iso file fine BUT when i played it on my dvd player and xbox it said regonial code errer, so my question is why is it a regon code dvd for and how do i fix this thank -you so much peace."
,ChuckemuHaven,2008-11-11T15:05Z,"This DVD version of Timewarp is awesome, however I must warn the rest of you that this DVD version is not coded regional for the USA. Its designed to be played in Europe, Africa and some other country. So If your trying to play this on your normal DVD player, it wont work unless you have a multi-regional DVD player you dont know about. Playing it on your computer will not work unless you download the proper regional codecs, which is what my Computer did when I tried to play it on my PC using PowerDVD, and it works great using the enter button and the up and down arrows.

Other then that, its a great game and hard as hell!"
,Mondoman22,2009-04-26T08:44Z,"Hey Guys,

,superloadedcat,2010-08-26T08:09Z,"dvd REGION NOT USA? HERES how to fix:

1. Burn DVD
2. Download & Install ANYDVD
3. Run ANYDVD; stick in burnt DVD into drive
4. Use ANYDVD to change the REGION to 1 USA
5. NOW COPY/IMAGE your fake region 1 DVD
6. The NEW copy will be REGION 1 USA, because anydvd faked it to be region 1, and you copied it.

7. Now the DVD will play in your region 1 USA dvd player, playstation, pc dvd drive, etc.....

,Tweaner,2010-12-20T20:50Z,"You don't need to burn a disc to use with Daphne. Just mount as a virtual DVD ROM with daemon tools and Daphne will use it to decode the automatic file download. BTW, Dapne uses a built-in bittorrent client for this, so you need to exit your regular client until it's finished."
,SABERWOLF357,2011-09-18T09:23Z,"Don't listen to ""superloadedcat"", ""Tweaner"" had the right idea.

This is a more simpler way to make these games playable your PC without burning them to a disc.

Step #1 ) First, after you finish downloading, weather it be Space Ace, Dragon's Lair or Dragon's Lair II, make a disc image ( ISO.image ) of the specified named game ( Dragon's Lair, Space Ace, Dragon's Lair II ) folder which you have downloaded from this torrent, make a image file by using a program called ""Img Burn"" or what ever disc imaging software you use, so...... if you wanted to play all three games you would have to make 3 separate disc images. 

In my case I only want to play ""Dragon's Lair"" because I had the other games already :)

Step #2 ) Next, download a program called ""Daphne"" from this site below.

http://www.daphne-emu.com/site3/index_hi.php

Select which Operating System you are using an download the file.

The program will be downloaded as a zip file, create a folder on your desktop an unzip the contents of the zip file into it, now name the newly created folder ""Daphne"", open that it an ""Click"" on the ""DaphneLoader"" located in said folder.

Step #3 ) When you ""Click"" on the ""DaphneLoader"" it will prompt you to update the program ( You must accept the program update or your game will not work properly!!!!! ). 

Step #4 ) Once updated look for the game you want to play on the list, click on it an hit the ""Start"" button, now a separate window will appear displaying a ""Warning"" message, ignore it an click ""OK"".

Step #5 ) After the above step another Window will appear saying: ""Daphne will now try to get more Video/Audio required files from the internet""
----------------------------------------------------
Please Note: You must be connected to the internet for the above step!!!!
It may take awhile to download depending on your connection.
----------------------------------------------------

Click ""OK"" an proceed!!!!

Step #6 ) Now the program will download a few additional folders, a ( vldp_dl, roms folder, etc..... ) too that ""Daphne"" folder, once it's finished downloading the necessary components which will be located in that ""vldp_dl"" folder which will total 3.26GB in size after it's finished downloading.

Step #7 )After the download has completed a window will pop up telling you to insert a disc, you can either do that if you have burnt these game files to DVD disc already or you can mount the image file for which ever game you have created one for into your image mounting program, these
programs are actually called ""Virtual Drive"" programs, there are many programs out there ( PowerISO, Daemon Tools, etc... ) I personally use magic disc for mounting. 

Step #8 ) Once you have mounted or inserted your disc, the Daphne program will start verifying an authenticating the cd so it's playable in your region (NTSC/PAL), when it's done another window will open displaying a update after which you will be able to play the game afterwards.

Starte the game of your choice, game will open up in the Daphne emulator program once you have completed all the steps above. :)

Now play the game the way it was meant to be played. :)

Arcade Style!!!!!!!!! :)"
