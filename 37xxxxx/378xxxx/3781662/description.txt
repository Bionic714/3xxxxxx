since the launch of suprnova yesterday august 21, 2007, there have been many questions surrounding the workings of the site and how the idea for a relaunch came about.  in this interview, both sloncek and brokep convene to answer user submitted questions.  while the quality of the audio isnt great, the answers are very informative.  btw, the windows sounds are not my fault, they came from whoever ripped this live, which wasnt me.
