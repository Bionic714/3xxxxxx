Song I made using Magix Music Maker Deluxe.

Techno/Trance song about the city of the school I worked at in Japan.  All voice is my own remixed.

The song is 100% from scratch and my 1st totally 100% original.

Let me know what you think!

(the names I used were 3 co-workers I worked with at the time ;)
