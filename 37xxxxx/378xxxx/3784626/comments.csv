capable of being in dialogue with
any other religion - or anyone 
who think other than islam - for that
matter......"

I know nothing about the author of this text but apparently you don't either. The beginning of dialogue is to listen to the other side. 

I'm not muslim, or christian (thank God I'm an atheist) but I know enough of both sorts to know that there is not ONE Christianity nor ONE Islam.  Every person must be met with respect form what he really is himself, not being quickly and biasedly judged. You don't have to agree, on the contrary. But you must know what you oppose."
