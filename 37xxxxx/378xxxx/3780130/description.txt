This 1971 album from Coventry's very own Indian Summer is an absolute neglected classic of the era.
Bob Jackson's passionate yet subtle vocals and authentic trademark keyboards are standouts of this 'progressive', if you have to call it that, album. Loud and 'heavy' at times, yet eerie and sensitive at other points.

Wonderful album that has it all.
