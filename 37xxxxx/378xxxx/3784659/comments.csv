,DJPubRock,2007-08-30T10:58Z,The girl in this film has a very nice body but a face like a pig. I love jap gals but japs make rotten pronos - wots with all the soft focus bollox and the little girl acting. and why do jap gals ALWAYS act like they are being violated/forced/raped etc. Not worth the download imho. The best pronos are the classic xxx films. Modern porn sucks donkey balls.
,Cameigons,2007-09-26T18:53Z,"Indeed, that way of japaneses doing porn sux. This sadomasochistic stuff seems to be what turns on the jap boys... =/"
,luckyethel,2007-12-17T12:11Z,"gotta agree with DJPubRock--  Japanese have some wierd perceptions of what sex is about .Maybe all the violent sex comics, and the rampant sales of worn schoolgirl pants they like to sniff (available in coin-op machines, for gods' sake! - plastic  wrapped for freshness and with photo,so you can experience the latest comic vicariously and later smell it )
  Their porn is odd to western eyes, their mindset even stranger, oddly unlike western porn they presumably think this is better


maybe"
,roxor2,2008-02-01T06:36Z,it was the A-Bomb.
,AartSnikkelbaard,2008-02-20T22:30Z,"Like the majority of contemporary western pron is that good... Fake tits, lips and w/e and those awful plateau heels all over. I'm with DJPubRock. Generally the classics are the best."
,Numskull808,2009-02-15T00:19Z,"Jap porn vs. American or European porn!?   Hell yeah there is a lot of weird Japanese porn but have you ever thought about how incredibly gay american ""straight"" porn the only reason women are in most NA films is so all the cock obsessed men out there can still say they are straight.   It's all sausage.  4 guys one girl.  Yikes.  Classics are the best at least when they had multiple people involved there were more women than men.  "
