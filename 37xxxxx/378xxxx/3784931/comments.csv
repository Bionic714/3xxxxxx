Read the .nfo on how to crack the game, its not a simple crack where you just copy the .exe!"
,RIPEnet,2007-08-26T13:05Z,"Does this work? I've read elsewhere that it has been nuked, however it is possible that it has been fixed. Can anyone confirm it?"
[M],Q91,2007-08-26T13:12Z,"You need the real key to get it working, so if you've bought it, and dont want to sue the DVD, it should work"
,Robinhero,2007-08-26T13:33Z,"Can anyone PLEASE upload just the ""Crack from OHW-Folder""??"
,Robinhero,2007-08-26T14:59Z,bs-ohw.rar in the archive is only the first of all rar-files. I havent found the crack only anywhere. If you have a direct link please post

Crack Install Instructions:

1) Put ""paul.dll"" & ""Boishock.exe"" in your install folder (backup the originals incase)

2) Run secu.eg.reg (importing it into the registry)

3) Play Bioshock

4) Visit stansdad.com for free South Park episodes!


Another crack that you can try. I still don't have the game to try it, but sooner or later there will be a working crack. Until then try this, hopefully it works!

	I swear i have seen lots of people say it is working on Vista but not so many on xp and there is no way i change to that piece of crap vista just to play this.

	I just need to get one last thing clarified from people who have successfully installed & ran the game.When it's mentioned to copy the crack files into the respective Bioshock release directory should we replace it over the existing files like "
,JeZuZ909,2007-09-04T16:46Z,"Im at 100% Down, But it stals at about 0.1kb/s.
above 150 seeders but none available?"
,ZERO_BS,2007-09-06T11:13Z,"100% working method of installation for this torrent can be found here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3797154/BioShock_WORKING_crack_NO_BS

EVERYTHING is included... Even for you people who experience the ""This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect"" message."
,ZERO_BS,2007-09-06T11:41Z,Sorry... Typo. Make that: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3797162/BioShock_CRACK_ZERO_BS
,pedro.m.m.silva,2007-09-10T20:22Z,"It's WORKING on my computer, using the Bioshock Crack-ScenePwned [Razor73]. follow the steps and it will not asking for any key, but you'll have an error message when you try to play it for the first time, but you just need to start it again.

This seems to be a very good game....."
,maigiri,2008-08-28T07:23Z,espero que funcione y que no tenga virus
