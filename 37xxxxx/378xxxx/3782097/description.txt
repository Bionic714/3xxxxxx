Synopsis




When he loses a highly publicized virtual boxing match to ex-champ ROCKY BALBOA (Sylvester Stallone), reigning heavyweight titleholder Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver) retaliates by challenging the Italian Stallion to a nationally televised, 10-round exhibition bout. To the surprise of his son (Milo Ventimiglia, TVâ??s â??Heroesâ??) and friends, Rocky agrees to come out of retirement and face an opponent whoâ??s faster, stronger and thirty years his junior. With the odds stacked firmly against him, Rocky takes on Dixon in what will become the greatest fight in boxing history, a hard-hitting, action-packed battle of the ages!..
