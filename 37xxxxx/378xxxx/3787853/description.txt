This is a .txt file from notepad with a link to a forum. Its not a fucking virus whoever removed it. This website has over 29000 members. I putting this here because everytime you upload a runescape cheat someone accuses it of being a virus. This is a fucking text file with a link you can copy and paste into google if you like to see if this site is real (which it is)

This way people can go there and get the cheats for themselves and not have to worry about getting corrupt files off of here.

This site has macros for runescape which are practically undetecable.And if anyone posts this fucking 25 byte text file is a virus I swear I will post every damn file you have is a virus as well. Dont pull this shit with me. Its too easy to verify this site.
