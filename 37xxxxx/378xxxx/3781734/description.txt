? 	Before nerds, geeks and cyberpunks, there was regular-guy 
Medfield College student Dexter Riley (Kurt Russell), who accidentally 
turns into a human computer through a shocking lab mishap. As the 
hype over his instant genius threatens to swell his head, he becomes the 
center of a winner-take-all tug-of-war between greedy college deans and 
dangerous gamblers, which lands him in big trouble. The "genius" Dexter 
then learns a valuable lesson when the same friends he had earlier turned 
his back on now rush to bail him out.
