,JimmyTheGent,2007-10-29T09:17Z,Great upload! Thanks for this one amico.
,damunzy,2007-11-21T04:10Z,"Funny, I was about to suggest that you get it directly from the author but his website points to this torrent to download. :)
Saved myself from a foot (keyboard) in the mouth moment."
,CCCloud,2007-11-26T17:50Z,"You know, this thing messed up my internet connection ;).
The program works fine and everthing but me sure that you are sure that you know what you're doing, like I wasn't sure :D."
,lahna1,2007-11-30T20:59Z,"Yeah right.. Fucking viruses all you stupid idiots!
scanned em with Kaspersky and including dangerous viruses that makes effect on your computer parts so i recommend to scan your computer or the files including on this torrent because Vidiii sure is a fucking virus sender asshole!"
,infin8888,2007-12-08T20:40Z,"I used dragonscanner and found virus definitions in these files, BEWARE!"
,mrbeers2232,2007-12-22T23:26Z,"Some people really are dumb arent they? The whole point of downloading this is BECAUSE OF THE VIRUSES!!!! But your computer is NOT infected with it, U INFECT OTHER COMPUTERS. What do U think the Port scanner, the mass ping, the Ip scanner, the file injector, and the email bomber do? They will show up as a virus in ANY virus scanner. "
,omgcrk,2008-01-01T11:19Z,"this fucked up my computer pretty badly at least i'm pretty sure it was this because this was the only thing I have downloaded today. 

time to go find a decent anti-virus program so this bullshit won't happen again, don't download this"
,mlavxela,2008-01-07T03:19Z,Thanks:)
,creative1seed,2008-01-08T21:33Z,"hmm, leave the suiteish comments, thus die!"
,Zirak_90,2008-01-16T03:40Z,"Net Tools, more like Hacker tools :P"
,AnGrY_BaStArD,2008-01-16T19:23Z,"to the people who think this messes up their connection - your an idiot and definately shouldnt be playing with professional networking tools
to the people who think its all viruses - your an idiot and shouldnt be going anywhere near these tools or youll be like the above

baby virus checkers like yours will always throw a warning over decent network tools - these tools, when you know what their doing are essential for various network diagnostics including checking your servers security settings

please idiots, stick to limewire cause your just wasting space on a very valuable resource - ie this server

note:iso's, rar's, zip's etc need other software to decompress/open and daa's are excellent for downloads as the compression is huge!"
,malcp,2008-01-25T16:18Z,"I dont know if this is virus or not, and its just done downloaded. The one who created those programs etc should have a reward. GOOD JOB FFS i LOVE u, man now i can revenge on the fucking bitch in my fucking class whose so fucking cocky. sorry but i HATE her and seriously, if killing would be legal she would've been dead!"
,HyperPete,2008-01-27T04:26Z,"If it's not a trojan / Virus, then explain the file 
oqbqpu.DRV
which appeared immediately after installation and contains all system passwords, all YIM logs, passwords and account names and much more???

And no, this was not a virus scan that found it...  ASSHOLE!  "
,Flow_Jay,2008-03-05T00:34Z,just remember after u ping an IP and get in a server there is a backlash that traces u so make sure u delete ur log files.  this way u dont end up in jail

,inAcrysis,2008-03-13T03:00Z,"ps

,stassano,2008-03-17T03:52Z,"inAcrysis spying like this on your kids will make them distrust you also. I bet you are a worried mother but trust me on this, you will do more damage than good if you do this *speaking out of experience.

Thanks for your upload Vidiii, now I am off to catch that bastard who has been on our company network."
,metal_head81,2008-03-26T03:28Z,yeah i dont think i trust this shit man.you say it picks it up as a virus cuz it scans your computer for info.but i use cain and able and that doesnt show up a virus and it also has a few sniffers and other useful tools.so i dont know dude
,twesterhold,2008-04-05T08:59Z,"Net Tools is freeware.  It is possible that this DL has bad stuff in it, but if you think you can trust the maker, just down load it from him http://users.pandora.be/ahmadi/nettools.htm The site is kind of shaddy, so I'm not sure... I'll try it on virtual machine first, which is always a good practice for all of you geniuses out there."
,gerijani,2008-04-11T14:04Z,"Anyone know a password generator,which can generate password with the given parameters so, that it could be saved into a txt file? But there is a trick! Which is, I need all combination. Just like ""John the ripper"" makes it, but backward. So I need the passwords in a list. Idea?"
,gogu68,2008-04-15T18:10Z,very nice upload! tnks man!(as someone says...let's go to jail!)

no viruses, it's clean. everything that you do in this program, can be done without using the program. this program just makes it a hell lot more painless. good luck ""hacking"" (god that word is used WAY to much.) using this program."
,christian350z_dude,2008-05-13T00:50Z,everything clean!  I scanned it with NOD32.  THANKS A LOT!!
,cyberax2650,2008-06-02T11:21Z,Is it Vista compatible?
,apimpnamedslickback,2008-07-11T23:19Z,Has a trojan *backdoor* but only after you install be careful

,H00AH,2008-10-29T00:35Z,HOW did u get this shit to work? I just a plane trial shit going on here!!!
,doubledge,2008-10-29T08:36Z,"YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THIS DIRECTLY FROM MABSOFT.COM HERE:
http://users.telenet.be/ahmadi/nettools.htm
This Website will also point right back here if you want to download using torrents.

HOWEVER - if you search for ""NetTools"" using Yahoo!'s search engine, it will report:
""Warning: Dangerous Downloads"", which is provided by McAfee.
If you follow the ""More Details"" link, you'll find the following:

(WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU UZIP THE MAIN PROGRAM)
Net Tools (NetTools5.0.70.zip)

McAfee?s REPORT:
In our tests, this download was free of adware, spyware and other potentially unwanted programs.
Read and confirm HERE:
http://www.siteadvisor.com/sites/mabsoft.com/downloads/15763227/

POTENTIALLY UN-SAFE or DANGEROUS ZIP FILES WITHIN NetTools:
(These programs will be installed by unzipping ""emailbomber.zip"" and ""exejoiner.zip"")

Mail Bomber 1.2.d 3.1.0 (emailbomber.zip)

McAfee reports finding - ""Generic FDoS.b Trojan""
Further investigation of this ""Trojan"" will reveal that it is NOT A THREAT - rather an ATTACK TOOL.
Read about it HERE:
http://vil.nai.com/vil/content/v_103054.htm

EXE Joiner (exejoiner.zip)
McAfee reports finding: ""Generic Dropper Trojan"" and  MultiDropper-CY Trojan.

The details on these 2 are lacking any real specifics. Although they are not listed as a ""Tool"", it would appear that ""Droppers"" are incorporated into many Viruses, Trojans, Spyware, etc.
Check out some of the ""DAT Readme"" info found at McAfee's ""Threat Center"" HERE:
http://vil.nai.com/vil/datreadme.aspx?seldatfiles=5206

MY CONCLUSION:
Looks like this stuff is on the level. It contains ""Tools"" that can be used for all kinds of NASTY PURPOSES, and it would appear that most Anti-Virus programs are NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT!

IF YOU'RE STILL INTERESTED, BUT WANT TO PLAY IT SAFE:
Download the main program and unzip it.
DELETE THE SUSPECTED FILES ""Mail Bomber 1.2.d 3.1.0 (emailbomber.zip)"" AND ""EXE Joiner (exejoiner.zip)""

HOPE YOU ALL APPRECIATE THE TIME I SPENT CHECKING THIS ONE OUT!
PEACE,
