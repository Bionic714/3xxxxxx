Inside 9/11: War on America

First two hours of National Geographic\'s 4 hour 9/11 documentary.

Originally aired 8 November 2005, this is from the 26 August 2007 airing on the National Geographic channel. There is supposedly some new footage and information, but I don\'t have the original to compare.

Captured via DirecTV standard-def National Geographic Channel, encoded to XVID.
