After Dark_Alex retired from the PSP homebrew scene, many people thought it was the end of the custom firmwares released by him. But it was not so, a few days later a Russian hacker team called M33 debuted their own custom firmware, which has now superseded Dark _Alex's OE firmwares as number one. They work very hard on this firmware, and they make no profit from it. So I highly suggest that you visit their page, and make a donation so the M33 team can continue hacking the PSP.
