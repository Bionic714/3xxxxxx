,aspireone,2009-03-11T18:23Z,"FYI: the french subtitle is just an optional .srt included in the download, the subtitles are not ""burned"" into the movie."
,browser9,2009-04-22T22:12Z,"Thank you! Very good video quality. English language with a French subtitle file, which can be ignored or deleted, i.e. this is a perfectly normal, subtitle-free English language movie. This version is by far the best available here. The ""English"" language versions are poor quality and in some cases cropped."

Reading some of the comments here I thought this was a quality encode. Well, it isn't. On to looking for a better one. I guess some of the commenters never saw a quality encode before."
