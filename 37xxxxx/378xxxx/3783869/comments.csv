forgot the tracklist:

Almost a whisper
The rain must fall
Swept away
Nostalgia
Felitsa
One mans dream
Quiet man
Until the last moment
Secret vows
The mermaid"
,grrahul,2007-09-03T20:21Z,ur description makes it sound like some guy made his own version of yanni's music and played it on the streets and u got his cd. Why would yanni need to play his music on the streets when the guy earns in millions? It's all of Yanni's original music. What a waste of download (not Yanni's music...that will forever stay great!)
