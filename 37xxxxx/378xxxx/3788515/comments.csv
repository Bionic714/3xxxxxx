,assassinmonk,2007-09-01T16:34Z,This is the real thing.  But there's a small blurred rectangle near the top of the screen.
,dizmarel,2007-09-01T21:28Z,"ok.. my buddy saw the movie this weekend and compared it to his copy and there were changes in the middle and the end of the movie, so i dont know if this is the final cut or unrated or a different version of the movie...and yes this copy is real"

,LinksHere,2007-09-03T01:51Z,"lots of people are flaming the movie, but to be honest i liked it. I always wanted to know how he was raised and how he acted ""before: he turned into a murderer and zombie really delivered on that, and i understand everyone has different taste but dont complain when you get to see the movie for free ;)"
,The.Norse.Crown,2007-09-03T06:44Z,"Really fucking real and Bloody brilliant! DVD quality with a little timecode blur at the top, but other than that 10/10 "

,Snusum,2007-09-03T18:35Z,"No, fucktard, he is MISTAKENLY RELEASED! God dammit.."
,roberco,2007-09-03T23:02Z,Aside from the small blur watermark at the top.. this is a very very nice release.. and to be honest.. if you have not seen it in theatres yet.. DONT.. SEE THIS VERSION... BECAUSE THE THEATRICAL VERSION HAS CUT OUT ALL THE GREAT SCENES THAT ARE STILL IN THIS VERSION OF THE MOVIE... I hope this release is the unrated dvd.. because this version blows the theatrical away and it makes me very upset that this version was not released.. because i believe people would have taken a different opinion towards it.. great great great version... man
,plinny,2007-09-04T16:04Z,"nice one uploader, im from the uk so this wont be out over here in the cinema for a while yet. an almost perfect release apart from the blurred out timecode at the top. not quite DVDrip quality but as close to DVDrip as you can get.
Video - 9/10
Audio - 9/10"

,lovehorror676,2007-09-05T21:38Z,Very good quality except... one MAJOR thing... I saw the movie in theaters before downloading this... and this one is missing a HUGE chunk in it and has a totally different ending than the one in theaters. It sorta pissed me off. The part missing is very important and the ending in the one in theaters is MUCH better than this one. 
,oldfaithful,2007-09-06T01:52Z,"What's the deal? Roberco and lovehorror676.One of you is saying this version is great and the theatrical one is shite,and other one saying the complete opposite. What gives?"
,rockyrockstar,2007-09-06T02:42Z,"To Snusum:

,Weedthrasher,2007-09-06T03:43Z,"it is a workprint. a leaked early version of the film edited totally differently, different ending, etc."

,Tolle44,2007-10-22T22:38Z,"To Stacey123

That's due to you not having the right codec. Codecs are ""AddOns"" (yes, i play WoW), that lets you see videos, which you wouldn't normally be able to see."
,ET3rNITy,2007-11-01T13:14Z,This movie its ok. No codec need it- Quality its good -Sound is perfect. Thanks. 
,moviemessenger,2007-11-03T02:24Z,"just downloaded this, blurry bit at top doesn't bother me as movie is good quality, and its free, it suits me fine as I'll never see it in the cinema anyway, as I live 30 miles from my nearest cinema. Thanks scttmwill "
