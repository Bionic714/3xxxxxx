Although, the program is very mediocre and lacks many of the usual tools when converting audio formats such as Bit Rate, Volume adjust, tuning etc. Also, the program is particularly slow at converting. It is free though so I guess if you can't possibly find anything else, this is your program.

Note: I mean no disrespect toward LegalTorrents I am providing information based upon what I have seen."
