ok brave fencer does not work on psp i found out AFTER i started seeding as such i am no longer seeding it

Chrono trigger and cross do work on psp m33 -2 if the firmware version is 2.50+ i think i may be off on the version but they work for me al
3
Granstream saga works but videos have no sound as the sound for the video is redbook and requires the cd idk how to fix this 
4 
yes i forgot to upload FF9 sorry that one is all  my fault 
5
Death Trap Doungon  has no sound on most firmware versions"
