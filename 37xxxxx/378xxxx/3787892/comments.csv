,anark2,2007-09-11T01:52Z,Thanks Worm Slayer! I have all your packets! Keep up the good work
,xartle,2007-09-25T06:04Z,Thanks for the great torrent!  I've been waiting for Dynasty Warriors. :)  Anyone have the password for Madden 08?  All the other files seem to be pw free...
,Burning_Elmo,2007-09-27T15:12Z,"Yeah, how can put these in mein ds?"
,xartle,2007-09-30T20:31Z,"Elmo:  You need to get a flash cart for your DS.  The main ones out right now that I know of are the M3, R4 and DSone.  Google will show you the way..."
,WormSlayer,2007-10-20T07:52Z,"I just had a look at Madden '08 and it isnt passworded, but is apparently corrupt :(

I'll include a good copy of it in the next rom pack!

Also I should pimp the DS-X cart, mine has been good as gold :)"
