,iayestaran,2007-09-14T14:01Z,"pardon my stupidity, but how does one know which specific files are the language tracks?"

Use DVD Shrink http://www.dvdshrink.org/what.html

To all,
The movie quality will always be much worse than the original when the stupid releaser save all audio tracks. Look for a release with one 5.1 audio track or at most two 5.1 audio tracks (not good but at least better than this one)."
