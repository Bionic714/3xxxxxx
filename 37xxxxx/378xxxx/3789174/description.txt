SYNOPSIS: n the year 2057, our Sun begins to die and mankind faces the unthinkable: extinction. Earth?s last hope lies with the Icarus II, a spacecraft manned with eight men and women led by Captain Kaneda. Their mission -- to deliver a nuclear device designed to reignite the Sun. Deep into their voyage, far out of radio contact with Earth, the lonely, restless crew hears a distress beacon from the Icarus I, the ship which disappeared without a trace on the same mission seven years earlier. 

But when an attempt at rescue throws the Icarus II into jeopardy, the increasingly desperate crew soon find themselves literally gripped in the shadow of the Sun, fighting for their lives, their sanity, and the future of us all...
