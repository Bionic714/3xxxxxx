I've found some Total Annihilation image files on some torrent sites and a few of them included some MP3s of the music so you could burn them on a seperate CD and play it while playing the game. They said they couldn't make an image file or ISO with the music for some reason. I found that to be ridiculous, went into Nero, started a new Mixed-Mode CD, added the files from the image file I downloaded, added my own CD-quality MP3s in the audio portion, and burned a CD to an image file. This NRG file (burnable using Nero) is of the complete Skirmish CD, including the CD audio files.

Just burn a CD using this image file and you will be able to hear the music from it in the game as well. No need for seperate MP3s or burning a seperate disc. This image file includes the CD audio in it.
