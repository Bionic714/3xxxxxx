,keegan123,2007-08-30T04:27Z,Download the torrent. The text file tells where to get it.
,bobtentpeg,2007-08-30T04:44Z,"I know I;m going to sound like a moron.

but how do i download stuff from usenet with a mac"
,keegan123,2007-08-30T05:38Z,"You need an account and a client, or a web-based access. Try googling."
,Sieber,2007-08-30T15:06Z,"We need the last 2 parts at usenet ;)


Thanks so far...


P.s. Panic is a good usenet app."

Thanks so far..."
,lillegubben,2007-08-30T18:28Z,"I did visit the mac.cd.images but could only find the last part, where are the previous ones?"
,Sieber,2007-08-31T01:44Z,"They r all up there but they are broken so you need the Par files up there as well, it a MOST complicated affair, but I finally managed to get it all working ;)"
,tenchimuy,2007-08-31T03:45Z,I would do usenet but comcast only gives 2 GB a month so I wouldn't even be able to finish it by the time leopard goes gold... or I could buy a usenet account somewhere else but I am hoping one of these kind usenet users will upload it to pirate bay eventually =)
,lillegubben,2007-08-31T11:05Z,I couldn't see the .rar maybe it's because my provider only allows me to see the messages not older than 10days on usenet. I'm downloading this buid from another torrent site. Thanx anyway.
,apriliars,2007-08-31T13:19Z,"@lillegubben:

which torrent are you downloading? its seems they're all dead or fake..."
,lillegubben,2007-08-31T13:45Z,"a new one on daemon oid. It was visible only an half hour. There are three seeders, hope this one is the real 9A527. I'm gonna post the link after, but before i want to be sure it's not a fake."
,Macsolo,2007-08-31T15:12Z,"May I ask, is it only working with your image??"
,xenakis,2007-09-05T15:22Z,"watch out -
