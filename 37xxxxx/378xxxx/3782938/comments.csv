,prasnto,2010-01-29T00:38Z,"So I was lookin' at the peerlist of the swarm and saw someone from this address in it:

noname.gryphonentertainment.com.au (59.167.194.192)

Going to their site - http://gryphonentertainment.com.au/ - they describe themselves as 'Australia's Leading Independent Film Distributor'.

But the funny thing is that this film doesn't appear to be listed in their catalogue: http://gryphonentertainment.com.au/catalogue/?alpha=W

The question then becomes why is someone from Gryphon Entertainment leeching this torrent? Are they attempting to police the content, or is it just some guy at work over there...it is a mystery :P."
