,mokie,2007-08-25T22:32Z,why 7.64 GiB? is it 2 dvd?
,guillerma,2007-08-28T23:08Z,"excellent!
is that a signed copy of the DVD?
thanks for sharing this!"
,crizpiz,2007-09-01T08:39Z,"Op Here: Yeah, its a signed copy of the dvd, pics and everything. Its a huge torrent, sorry  in hindsight I should have shrunk it.. would have nerfed the quality tho.. Anyway Ill be seeding this for months so be sure to get your ratios up and Pirate on!"
,Kee123,2007-09-01T14:59Z,Are you sure you're seeding? I was getting great speeds earlier but now I've came to a sudden halt with no speeds. Stuck at 11%
,tylerdm,2007-09-03T16:23Z,Has anyone gotten more than 11%?
,guillerma,2007-09-04T04:36Z,"I guess the counter is wrong, nobody is over 12%.

Hey ""crizpiz"" are you gonna keeps seeding? Cause it is going reaaaally slow."
,crizpiz,2007-09-06T06:18Z,"OP here, sorry the speed has sucked i have a comcast connection and as you all know they have been throttling torrent traffic. ive been looking into the matter, and Ive found a solution, speeds should be good from now on. "
,franty,2007-09-09T01:33Z,"i've been leeching it for 7 days, got as far as 17.2%, but this is going way too slow... hows everyone else doing?

well, i'll keep this torrent for as long as possible (for months if necessary).

thanks for the uploader, it's impossible to get this dvd on my country (i've tried several stores and sites), and i'm a really big fan of the lips.

i've seen them live in 2005, greatest concert of my life!

please crizpiz, keep seeding!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,Kee123,2007-09-09T22:33Z,"In the same situation as you franty, I'm at 17.9%

I get the odd moments of very high speeds, not last very long at all and then going back down to 0.

I really, really, really want this DVD :( And once I get it, I'll seed for everyone else"
,boliva,2007-09-10T05:59Z,"thnx for the torrent, been trying to find out this one since long with no luck - there seems that the lips aren't known in this country at all. 

I've been dl'ing from the torrent since the same day you ul'd it and it's way too slow, now that I read your comments I know it's because of the comcast traffic shaping. I'm now stuck at 18%, try to reseed it from somewhere else, I'd really appreciate what you're doing for us lips fans."
,franty,2007-09-10T19:19Z,"i'm at 18.5% now.

i'm not giving up!!!! >:D"
,ChocolateJedi,2007-09-11T02:01Z,"Does this setting do anything? 
Utorrent>pref>bittorrent
Protocol Ecryption outgoing (enabled) ??

Thanks for uploading, Im patient.
We are almost 1/5 done."
,franty,2007-09-11T17:51Z,20.2%
,ChocolateJedi,2007-09-15T01:46Z,"Thanks for keeping it up Crizpiz.

I see your seeding, however you show 0% complete.  Im trying to guess why.

I see that you use a different port each time Utorrent starts.  You may want to pick a port and configure your firewall to forward that port.
"
,Fa11z,2007-09-15T20:33Z,"Crizpiz if you can finish seeding to us, I'll seed for a couple of days. Don't have a huge out, but its better than 0 seeds."
,crizpiz,2007-09-16T06:51Z,"crizpiz here (OP) Ill be seeding this for months, as I said My upload speed is rather shitty (thanks COMCAST ), but Ill try to make up for it by seeding it forever. :P"
,franty,2007-09-17T18:43Z,still here... only 23.4% :(
,Kee123,2007-09-20T22:39Z,23.82%....
,ChocolateJedi,2007-10-01T18:45Z,"just over 30% :) thanks Crizpiz

Crizpiz, I have Comcast and upload at 44k all day.  I cant ping you and you apear with 0%.  Im thinking you may have a router and or firewall? They both need to foward 61515.
I read on Utorrent site, UPnP port mapping sometimes causes problems uploading.

I hope this helps.  I had to do all that to make uTorrent work with Comcast around here."
,boliva,2007-10-03T01:44Z,"30.8% @Â 30 kb/s, I think I've never got that speed from this torrent. Please keep it like that crizpiz, and a big THANK YOU"
,franty,2007-10-03T08:18Z,"same here, just over 30%..."
,crizpiz,2007-10-07T20:42Z,"Crizpiz here, Heheh, your quite welcome, i tried that port forwarding thing mentioned by an earlier poster, and MAN DID IT HELP. Ill be seeding this forever pretty much, so I hope you all get a chance to download the full thing. ENJOY!"
,franty,2007-10-16T22:14Z,"i'm at 40% still slow... i never see you crizpiz (well, i never see a 100% peer)."
,mokie,2007-11-02T23:47Z,"okey, Im gonna order the DVD now. will tell you when i get it  =)"
,arto124,2007-11-04T15:07Z,stuck at 52%.. any seeds? it says there should be about 20.......
,mokie,2007-11-05T18:56Z,GOT IT!! Have fun downloading =)
,ChocolateJedi,2007-11-14T04:43Z,"I was able to buy the DVD, its worth it."
,kamonn,2008-01-02T00:16Z,"SEED PLEASE, there are 13 peers stuck at 60,2% of this huge 7gb torrent."
