,km1,2008-12-16T00:53Z,"While I thank you for your exceptionally high quality upload I must express a bit of disappointment. First I download a Dali torrent with no 'Persistence of Memory' and now a Picasso torrent with no 'Guernica'. Oh well, I guess I shouldn't complain, it was free, and I don't upload anything myself. The images are of a first rate quality though, thanks again."
