,scorpio_india69,2008-04-29T12:56Z,"Hello Neuczarny,

This is very useful upload and a must for English user. While installing the setup file, the user should install sounds to have a idea of correct pronunciation of the words. Thanks to you again ! "
,Adil_Jamal,2008-05-09T10:53Z,"This is a WinXP aware dictionary, unlike v10. The Unabridged Addon is actually standalone Merriam-Webster's Unabridged Dictionary--a Win2000 aware only, but runs also on WinXP.

Thanks to you all the nice guys!"
,scorpio_india69,2008-05-23T09:27Z,"A Very Good Upload who does not have Britannica Encyclopedia on their PCs.

If you have Britannica 2008 on your machine, then it comes with newer version of this dictionary built in.

Anyway, thanx neuczarny !!!!!  "

,lovelyandkind,2009-04-05T13:36Z,"To all those who are so selfish and self-centred, I beg you to seed, it is immoral to download a program from a torrent site and not seed, remember that it was someone who uploaded the program and seeded it for you to be able to download it.
Also as you seed, at the same time upload, by doing so other peers would be able to download, when you upload, it helps the torrent manager to download fast.
Please be kind enough to seed and upload."
,speedypear,2009-05-22T09:20Z,Works and installs like a dream. Thank you neuczarny for sharing!
,dreamjockey,2009-06-02T20:55Z,"the torrent stops at 701.1 MB. no need to panic... thats the real size of the torrent. so once it's reached 701.1 MB u can stop the torrent, use it to install the dictionary and seed once u r done with installation.
Tested on Kubuntu using Wine.

Thanks neuczarny!! Its a great resource for GRE prep :)"
,boonp,2009-07-11T18:12Z,"Does it need any registration info ?

,miakolee,2010-01-23T00:12Z,works fine
,gahaj123,2010-03-23T21:18Z,"Lol it's immoral to download this already... with few exceptions of course....
Just to let some people know, incase this happens to you, when you mount the image and your unable to start application, you have to explore the mounted drive and manually start the setup...just saying"
,StanOntario,2010-07-07T00:45Z,"This is the absolutely best computer dictionary I've seen over the years. My old American Heritage doesn't run under Win 7-64, but this one (2003) works great!! 

Unlike the Oxford stuff: Lots and lots of detail! Although the unabridged version is included, I don't believe audio pronunciation works with other than the 11th Collegiate option.

Really great program though; and probably the best out there!"
,scottsasse,2010-11-19T04:30Z,"Oh me so happy, me thank you long time!!! :)  THANKS for this & THANKS to all those who seed it!!"
,Setton,2011-03-24T09:24Z,Thank you for the great torrent! :D
,MoneyRulez,2011-12-19T04:53Z,"please anyone can get me out? I installed it buy couldn't get pronunciation work, it doesn't pronounce words for me, during the installation I marked Audio package as well It done installation but when I'm searching a word there is no button or anything to click and listen to pronunciation, any ideas? thanks I'm still seeding"
,evilperro,2012-03-02T21:57Z,"If anyone get stuck at 90% when running setup try checking sound files in the very beginning. 

I got this running windows 7 (windows xp SP3 compatability and run as admin) when they were unchecked. "
