Plot: Put together a gloomy New England house, a dark night and four of America's legendary leading men and you have all the ingredients for a classic 'Ghost Story'. The spine tingling motion picture stars Fred Astaire, Melvyn Douglas, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and John Houseman as members of The Chowder Society, a group of hale and hearty fellows who get together each week to share incredible tales of horror. 

However, real fear and terror begin to stalk the foursome when they discover that one of their most fightening stories is actually coming to life due to a horrible secret they all share. One by one the membership of The Chowder Society begin to die mysteriously and the past begins to reveal itself in a manner far more deadly and chilling than any ghost story ever spun by the group.
