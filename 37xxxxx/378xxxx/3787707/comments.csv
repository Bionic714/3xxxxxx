How do I save in this game? (Not talking about being able to save at the end of each mission.) My entire saved account is gone as well as mission progress.

I get prompted asking for my ""new name"". :(
plz help"

,ogodefacto,2009-07-05T10:10Z,"im running asus n10j netbook with vista.  this was not working for me at first (spitting me back out to desktop right away).  i opened error.log in alien shooter folder which said prob was it was set to run at 1024x768 which netbooks do not support (unless you managed to get compressed 1024x768 working which looks weird and which still most netbooks dont have). 
 I opened regedit and went to:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SigmaTeam\Alien2\
Changed ScreenX and ScreenY to 1024x600.
works good now.  thx."
,eurosonly,2009-09-10T04:05Z,i double click on game icon. i get a black screen. game exits.the end what now?
,SK3TCH78,2009-10-17T10:56Z,"Holy shit I thought with all the IFFY responses to the game that it would suck or not work or both. But seriously DOPEMAN YOU FUCKIN ROCK!!!!
I have been playing this game for two days now on XP with absolutely no problems and it is soooo fun! I love the fact that you can play almost the whole game with your mouse alone. I only Download games from you dude because 9 out of 10 times they work perfectly.

,DarkOrbitDeathPilot,2010-01-20T03:17Z,I love the zombie/alien shooter games. Simple but definitely a classic. Think Ill stop playing my other games for a lil bit and go back to a time when things were much simpler (by shooting some zombies in the face)  :p     Thx 4 the u/l
