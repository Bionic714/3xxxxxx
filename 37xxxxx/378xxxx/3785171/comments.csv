,PilotBob,2008-04-20T12:04Z,"Thanks for the upload TzzMeister, very helpful indeed.

Isn't it amusing how people frightened of new technology or change are always the ones with little or no command of their mother tongue and have to resort to basic moronic language to try and make what they and they alone think is a valid point!"
,gmailcesar,2008-06-05T03:52Z,people always want to criticize what they dont understand new and better hardware is being built and so is software that uses those tools phxanarchy wants to play assassins creed on a nintendo 64
,gmailcesar,2008-06-05T03:54Z,yeah buddy phxanarchy you want to run vista on pentium 1 computer and then wonder why its so slow
,Thee-Wuggles,2008-08-07T03:37Z,"Vista IS NOT bad at all, I was quite a pissed off customer when I was told their computers only had Vista, but after a while you get used to it, and find awesome tweaks, themes, optimizers, etc.. and will run as fast or faster than XP.
I can Run Adobe Flash,Photoshop, and Dreamweaver while playing music on my 1GB Vista, where as 1GB XP It lagged.. Soo..

We use Vista because we own our computers, what are you gonna do when your school switches to Vista to? LOL. Guess you'll be a slave to."
