SYNOPSIS/PLOT: Tom Hanks stars as Chuck Noland, a FedEx executive who flies around the world solving problems for his shipping company. A taskmaster and devotee of time management, he squeezes in a rushed Christmas Eve dinner with his fiancÃ©e (Helen Hunt), before he is called away to a company crisis in the South Pacific. Before boarding his flight, he gives her a surprise gift that appears to be an engagement ring, and he promises to return for New Year's.
Noland's flight suffers a catastrophic explosion over the Pacific and crashes into the sea. He emerges as the sole survivor and begins a remarkable, modern-day Robinson Crusoe existence on an uninhabited island where time â?? which he valued so highly â?? is now meaningless. Faced with absolute isolation, he must quickly learn survival skills to save both his live and his sanity.
