I'll download it and scan it (Your Anti-virus will usually detect another installed anti-virus as a trojan, because it scans your files. In those cases, it's usually a false positive."

These updates installed flawlessly... But they're out of date as of 8/31/2007 - Not LegalTorrent's fault - But mine, for not paying attention. There is no virus, or malicious software in this, it looks like it came straight from Kaspersky's update labs. Whether they did or not, I'm not sure - Maybe Legaltorrents customized them to make them better, or something, but I doubt it.. They're completely harmless.

Vermony, there is no 'MSO' file. I think you may have typoed for 'MSI', but there's no MSI file either.. Maybe you have the wrong torrent? :p

(I scanned with BitDefender, so... It could be wrong, but my computer hasn't exploded and my hard drive hasn't failed.. so I assume that it's clean. I formatted recently, so I have to re-download all of the anti-virus, anti-spyware, and firewall(s) I was using, because like a stupid person, I forgot to back them up :p


Thanks for the updates Legal."
