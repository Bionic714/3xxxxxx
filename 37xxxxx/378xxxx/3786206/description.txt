This torrent represents a work of LOVE. All texts so far gathered, as well as all future gatherings aim at exposing interested students to occult information.

This mega-torrent emphasizes practical study of occult sciences. This version primarily focuses on the Western Hermetic Tradition, but a respectable amount of Eastern esoterica has also been included. Future versions of the torrent will include submissions from other interested students.

For some of us, the time has come to mobilize. If you have an interest in assisting in this process - we all have strengths to bring to the table - please email occult.digital.mobilization AT gmail.com.

Complacency serves the old gods.

Torrent contains:

Phil Hine - Techniques of Modern Shamanism vols. 1-3
