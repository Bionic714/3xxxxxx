This great old pool, billiards game Maximumpool still got Online rooms and players in them. This version is fixed and patched so your game will hook up with the new room servers, that appeared after Sierras server shutdown on 16th of august 2007.

With all the great games of CoolPool, 8 and 9 ball, rotation etc, this Maxpool game also include the great games of carom and snooker. It also has great multiplayer action with up to 4 players at the table at the same time.

This is a small zipped version of the game (41MB) with no sound but im sure that once you're in the rooms people will help you find the full version of max pool too.

How to get started:
Un-zip the files to a folder. Run the RegSetup.exe. Then start pool.exe and press F5 if u get a blank list in the Online room list.


Enjoy and please seed to keep this great game online
