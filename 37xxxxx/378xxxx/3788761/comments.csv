,Kronon,2007-09-25T19:56Z,"Nice torrent, I was looking for more music from Delerium"
,langrisser,2007-10-01T05:02Z,"For some reason this torrent only has 3 tracks from Chimera 2 from the album cd and 1 from the bonus cd 

look for the other torrent of Chimera with the full 13 tracks from the album cd and 3 from the bonus cd"
,langrisser,2007-10-01T05:08Z,Also noticed the torrent is missing 2 full albums Poem and Poem II and it has Karma dated as released in 1994 instead of 1997 when it was.
