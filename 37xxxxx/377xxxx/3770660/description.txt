2007 Wimbledon Finals

Roger Federer vs. Rafael Nadal

Downloaded from Wimbledon.org, so there\'s no announcers (but there are slo-mo replays and stats)

384 x 288

Stripped the DRM and edited out inconsequential points.

I left in both tiebreakers and the 5th set (where they really picked up their games) in their entirety.

My upstream is a little meager at about 50kB/s, but stick with it and we\\\'ll get it out there.
