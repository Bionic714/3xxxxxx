,Chigwells,2012-06-04T16:06Z,"Downloaded this despite warning.
Had no problem at all, scanned with (paid for) AVG 2012 and (paid for) Emsisoft Anti-Malware and nothing found. Played all tracks in Sandboxie and again, nothing flagged up.
However, in the folder as well as the 20 mp3 tracks, are 18 'padding file' files, _____padding_file_0_if you see this file, please update to BitComet 0.85 or above____, _____padding_file_1_if you see this file, please update to BitComet 0.85 or above____, etc. Have seen such before and don't know what they are but erased them from folder copied over to my music collection."

""Due to a new feature recently introduced into Bitcomet’s torrent maker, people who do not use BitComet (the majority) are sometimes forced to download so called “padding files” which is — for them — a waste of time and bandwidth.""

Seem harmless enough, I'd say the torrent is OK, but you'll want to test it yourself as well :)"
