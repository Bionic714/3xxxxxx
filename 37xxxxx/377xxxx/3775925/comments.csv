,4X-AXG,2007-08-17T13:06Z,"btw, I just donated! to AVSIM :D"
,Panodilo,2007-08-17T13:30Z,"JB, I also gave back to the community. I donated semen in your mom's name at my local sperm bank."
,zippee,2007-08-17T13:35Z,Many thanks 4X :)
,4X-AXG,2007-08-17T13:54Z,"I don't think JB minds swallowing cum, as long as it's not Jew's cum hahaha"

,4X-AXG,2007-08-17T14:24Z,"happy flyer, Brussels was uploaded here long long time ago.."
,Panodilo,2007-08-17T15:53Z,"lol - that's great stuff, bobdaslob rofl"
,neslesman,2007-08-17T17:15Z,"Thanks 4X and I wish some people would grow up and get over this Wingz thing.  It's so childish and boring to everyone that couldn't care less ...which is 99% of us.
It really looks like N53 doesn't want to see 4X share on here.  All those in favour of 4X sharing whatever he damn well pleases say aye.

Aye."
,BritneysOrifice,2007-08-17T18:06Z,"N53 is just hyper-sensitive to criticism. Apparently he (or one of his friends) was criticized -- very likely legitimately -- by 4X at some point, and from then on, he's been on a crusade with a couple of other folks to throw mud at 4X. Lemming-like behavior clearly indicative of sucking on Momma's booby too long.

I'll say it here and I'll say it anywhere. I love WoS, the community there is cool, and special VIP stuff is respected by 4X and others and is rarely released to the warez public. But once that stuff is made non-VIP, then it pretty much becomes open season for sharing it. I think the WoS management knows this, understands the concept, and is comfortable with it.

The thing that various lemmings tend to forget is the time and effort it takes to share. I mean... 4X's dick doesn't grow an inch every time he shares. As a point of fact, any time one of us shares anything -- anywhere -- it takes time to upload/seed, etc. and that's time we could have easily been doing something else. It's a sacrifice of time and bandwidth... not much, but over time, it's quite a sum of energy.

I'd love to hear someone explain why some folks need to complain about those who share stuff with the community and who gain absolutely NOTHING in doing so. I mean... talk about bad manners. Sheez."
,The_Hangar_18,2007-08-17T18:25Z,Ja Mann ^^
,neslesman,2007-08-17T19:24Z,"Here here
You said it better than I could Brit.  "
,N537JB,2007-08-17T21:56Z,"BritO, Yea I'm to 110% with you, but this thing started when  he  thought that I had take the ASX stuffs from SANGEKi.. If you look in all my other sharing stuff, you will see creds for those that has credits. So... 'If you start a play, you have to play with me' :) Aiight? Now (this is for you 4x-axg) shut the fuck up if someone 'takes someone elses' release, cuz, u aint no better, you are the so called STEALER.

Capish."
,BritneysOrifice,2007-08-17T23:07Z,"N53:

Well, you really can't be with me 110%, because if you were, you wouldn't continue to rant on. Most importantly, the story has a bit more to it than you're letting on anyway; and even if your skewed story was accurate, it's still not justification to display vapid anti-Semitism in a public forum (or anywhere for that matter).

You probably have no idea how much you'd gain if you just kept your trap shut because -- when all is said and done -- no one gives a shit about the complainer, only the sharer. You honestly don't think someone leeching here is going to say: ""Oh, no! So-and-so didn't give the correct credits! I'm not going to download this! It wouldn't be right, no siree...""

Get real.

Drop all this bad-mouthing and you'll gain stature.  There's really no point to continuing it because you're the only loser, for shit's sake.

And, btw.. it's [i]capisce[/i].
And, yeah.... Capisco, camerata."
,Panodilo,2007-08-18T08:43Z,Getting all hard over here when you guys tell each other off in such a gentlle well worded manner. There something arousing about it. It's like doing long strokes on my cock in the eye of a storm.
,Baster23,2007-10-22T00:41Z,seed please ;o)
,Ugly Bob,2010-01-06T09:38Z,"Found it on my HDD, I'll seed as long as I can. :)"
