The lead track to the summer blockbuster Transformers
movie, Bleed It Out is the second single to be taken
from Linkin Parks chart-topping third album Minutes To
Midnight. Like the rest of the Minutes To Midnight set,
Bleed It Out was co-produced by Mike Shinoda and Rick
Rubin (U2, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Run DMC) and recorded at
the infamous Mansion at Laurel Canyon. Fiercely caustic
yet still immediately accessible, Bleed It Out
represents Linkin Park at the height of their powers.
