Plus, my dude that played Black Whirlwind was funny as hell... "" What i'm going to do play with myself"". 

Did you notice when Young Dragons' around  theres a little sound that goes ... Chicca-Chicca Cha!

Classic, off da chain Shaw Brothers Shith!"

,shinobiung,2009-02-27T23:15Z,"this is the chinese version, which sucks, not the Jap version which is style. but thanks JamesKees, I do appreciate it."

This is THE run run shaw epic WU XIA flic!

Chow Pai (Heavenly King) was assassinated, and his band of bandits, the ""Honorable 108"" avenge him.

Black Whirlwind's cool line, ""I promised Heavenly King I'd pull your heart out!""

Serious butt-kickery!!!!

Definately the Mandarin Chinese inspiration for Keenan Ivory Wayans to write ""I'm Gonna Git Ya Sucka"", the ""Death Wish Series"", Sonny Chiba's revenge flicks, especially ""Street Fighter"".

If you aren't into Kung Fu (aka Wu XIA) as a genre, this film will convert you into a fan.

It is also a great tale from Chinese culture, about 108 warlords, banished by the Dao master, who; upon paying proper penance, return to this world as a poor group of bandits, who pledge to defend innocent people from corrupt officials and bullies.

""All Men Are Brothers"" and ""108 Stars of Destiny"" are your sources for this.

If someone has the original 16:9 SHAWVISION of this in 70mm reel, the WU XIA croud would definately have a feast in your honor!

(Some might even let you play the role of the stewart of their house, and fuck their wife while they enjoy the film!)  ...just kidding honey!"

,ashpool1,2011-08-27T17:31Z,There is a third one.  All men are brothers-Blood of the leopard.  Asian torrents has all 3 in good condition.
