Overview:	The Chang Cheh-directed "The Water Margin": the martial arts epic of epics. Based on the true legend of how 108 rebel heroes living in the mountain were able to repeatedly defeat invading Sung armies, the film starred just about anyone who was a name at Shaw Brothers at the time, like David Chiang, Chen Kuan-Tai, and Ti Lung. The primitive battles ultimately end in sharp, visually effective images of death and defeat. This is a must-see for any movie fan.
