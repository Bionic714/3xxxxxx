More than 30 billion kilowatt-hours of energy is wasted because many of us simply forget to shut down our computers when we√¢??re not using them. If we could just improve the efficiency of how we use our PCs, the savings in energy costs would be over $3 billion dollars! The CO2 emissions from just 15 computers are equivalent in energy terms to the gas consumption used by one car.
