Jagdish Sheth In writing his book, Self-Destructive Habits of Good Companiesâ?¦and How to Break Them, Sheth found seven reasons behind why successful companies have such a short life span. After publishing, he felt that companies often committed yet another 8th offense: not enabling their people to rise to the top level of their talent. Instead, either companies employ too many people and donâ??t have challenging work for all of them, or these companies bring in outsiders who fail to connect with the existing culture such as Fiorina and Fisher and Nardelli.

-LEGAL TORRENTS

Purpose:

create a balance, share the already free stuff,
public domain works, freeware, free music,
free ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.

show the copyright owners that torrent
websites shouldn't bear the responsibility
of what their users upload, torrent websites
are very much similar to google..

users upload what they want to upload,
download what they want to download,
and search for what they want to search..

by creating this balance and sharing the already free
stuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..
