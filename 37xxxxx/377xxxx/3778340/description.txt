SYNOPSIS: Craven's final installment of his highly-successful SCREAM trilogy concludes with a fun, fast, and furious romp that cuts through B-movie cliches as readily as it does the warm flesh of its hip young cast. Sidney Prescott (Campbell) and friends Gale Weathers and Dwight Dewey Riley (Cox and Arquette) once again find themselves face to face with a masked psychopath, who's making deadly edits to the cast of STAB 3, the schlocky slasher film based upon Sidney's own real-life horrors. Fueled by Kruger's (ARLINGTON ROAD) snappy script, the third chapter packs a punch with a plenty of turn-on-a-dime plot twists and a high laugh-to-shriek ratio.
