Question 1
BELOVED OSHO,
A MAN LIKE YOU COMES ALONG ONCE IN ETERNITY. WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING AND SAYING IS UNIQUE. I\\\\\\\'M INDEED FORTUNATE TO BE HERE AND I MAY NEVER HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY AGAIN. YET EVERY MORNING I COME TO DISCOURSE, I FALL ASLEEP. AM I MISSING? SHOULD I ALSO GO AND JUMP IN KRISHNAMURTI LAKE?

It is just great -- have a good sleep! Sleep is not contradictory to enlightenment. You will make history by becoming enlightened in your sleep. And there is no need to go to Krishnamurti Lake. I am here -- your Krishnamurti Lake
But don\\\\\\\'t say that what I am saying is unique. It is simply the truth.\\\\\\\"
