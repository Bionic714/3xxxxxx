Undefeatable (Cynthia Rothrock, 1993)

Cynthia Rothrock plays a waitress, who moonlights as a gangfighter to earn money to put her sister through college. When her sister is one of the victims of a martial artist who is killing every woman who reminds him of his ex-wife, she goes looking for revenge.

Its not the deepest plot, but has a few nice moments (and bad puns). Basically the film exists as an excuse to string the fight scenes together and give the fighters a reason for combat. That's about it.
