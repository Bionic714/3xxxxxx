Plot: In 1989, Michael Moore, winner of 2002's Best Documentary Feature Academy AwardÂ« and Cannes Film Festival Special Jury Prize for 'Bowling for Columbine', triumphantly burst upon the American moviemaking scene with 'Roger & Me', a hilarious, penetrating forerunner of the independent film movement. 

Moore doggedly and hilariously tried to do what every working stiff dreams of; talk to the man at the top. His efforts to meet General Motors Chairman Roger Smith and persuade him to visit Flint, Michigan, frame a film that uses humor to devastating effect. 'Roger & Me' champions people over profits and slyly lampoons corporate America as it shows how the Flint folks cope with economic setbacks. As 'The Village Voice's' J. Hoberman wrote, the result is "gutsy, populist, outraged and outrageous."
