,R2d6.51,2011-07-02T05:14Z,"Hey Z3 this is one of the  best military history documentary sets on the market.

I can say that because I have just about every documentary ever produced on the subject because I've been collecting them ever since Television first came out when Victory @ Sea appeared along with Crusade in the Pacific in the early to mid 1950's.

I have thousands of programs on VHS & now DVD having converted many of them & bought a ton when they came out on DVD.

I'm new at this but I am gonna learn how to upload & make what I have in my own archive available here...so Kudos for sharing such a super set of valuable information because history is important."
,slmndow,2012-06-09T21:20Z,Thank you very much mr z3 and i am those who like battlefield all over the world...i will enjoy this i think.
