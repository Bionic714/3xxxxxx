About the series:
For more than ten years, "Battlefield" has led the way in World War Two documentaries. Often imitated but never surpassed, the series has become an almost permanent fiture in the schedules of broadcasters all over the world and has established itself as a firm favourite amongst generations of viewers new and old. "Battlefield" has also been on top of the list for military enthousiasts everywhere - an essential addition to any military collection. The Battlefield series is authoritative and entertaining, with equal appeal for military enthousiasts and casual viewers. Available now for the first time on DVD, this series features fascinating archive footage from all over the world, programmes include a review of the political and military situation before the battle, portraits of leaders and commanders, an explanation of weapons and tactics and the story of the battle itself. Vivid graphics place the battle into the context of the war as a whole.
