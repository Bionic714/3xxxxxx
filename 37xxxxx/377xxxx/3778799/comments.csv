,kmfdmk,2007-08-21T10:48Z,BTW.  In case it's not absolutely clear the Thumbdrive Utilities Suite that I have here can be loaded by clicking on the AutoPlay.exe  file.  If you burn the Utilities to a CD then the Utilities will AutoPlay upon CD Insertion into the computer.  Unfortunately a registry hack/modification is required to get AutoPlay to work with removable media such as Flash Drives.

AVG Anti-Spyware 7.5 w/ updates from 8-23-07 reports 3 issues with my Utilities:

Adware.Hotbar - HotbarUninst.exe - This is LEGIT as it's the Hotbar UNinstaller
Adware.PurityScan - oi_uninstaller.exe - This is LEGIT as it's the Outer Info spyware UNinstaller
Not-A-Virus.PSWTool.Win32.NetScaPass.a - netscapass.exe - This is LEGIT as it's a Netscape Password Recovery tool"

,kmfdmk,2007-08-27T23:04Z,"## Known bug ##
If you try to run CCleaner from the USB/CD it will give you an ""Error 0"" message.

Next revision will fully implement the portable version of CCleaner.

How can we update the antivirus defintions outselves?"
,kmfdmk,2009-08-24T06:15Z,"You can update the definitions yourselves by browsing the directories that are inside the image.  Simply remove the old updates and download the newer ones into their places.

Also you can update the program versions, however without re-coding your local version, you would have to ensure that you kept the EXACT SAME filenames as the originals.

That would mean changing new version of Firefox 3.5.2, to actaully say 3.0 or whatever it is.

The program I used to make this is technically not supposed to be re-distributed, (Violating the EULA), however it was a simple CD Executable.  You can search for CD Auto-Runs.

Also, on computers with AutoRun disabled (a lot nowadays) you'll have to manually run this (if from a CD).  

With the advent of Flash Drives getting more and more popular (and larger) it's a lot easier to just keep this and update it on a Flash Drive."
