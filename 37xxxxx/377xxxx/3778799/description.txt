Rusty's Utilz v2.2 rel. 08/19/2007

A GUI for a compilation of utilities that I used to use on a daily basis when I did PC repair.  I still use it on a regular basis to bail out friends PC's.

297MB ISO image file.  150MB of that is from now including three different Anti-Virus programs, 4 different Firewall programs and the added Internet & System programs.Burn to CD or use Daemon Tools or IsoBuster to extract the files from the image and place on your thumbdrive.  

The kmfdmk.ico icon file can be replaced with the icon file of your choice however you'll have to either rename your icon file to kmfdmk.ico or edit the autorun.inf file to reflect the new name.

**NOTE**

Some of these utilities are considered suspect by anti-virus programs, especially the password recovery ones.  Usually if you're looking you'll see them come up as Hacktool.Passreminders.  They're NOT viruses, or malicious.  You might want to keep the ISO backed up in case your AV programs delete some of the necessary files/programs.

Look for more updates in the future.  I hope to keep this updated monthly.
