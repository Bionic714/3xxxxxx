TE have released the new version of Ashampoo?s WinOptimizer. This is a utility that, well at least I think, is quite self explanatory. It is used for tweaking, and modifying Windows. So for you people that want an alternative to something like System Mechanic, then this should be your first stop!

Ashampoo WinOptimizer is an easy-to-use suite of tools for maintaining and optimizing your Microsoft Windows┬« computer. It keeps your Windows┬« installation free of unnecessary garbage and running smoothly while other computers just get slower and slower.

Program Features:

    * Compatible with Windows Vista? 32 and 64
    * Three new modules
    * New Windows Vista?-compatible disk defragmenter
    * Many new tweaking tools
    * Enhanced user interface
    * New Windows Vista? skins
    * Plus more!
