,garb77,2007-08-16T12:16Z,You mean that i have to download this torrent to play Bioshock. What is wrong with the old one.
,KingKobra78,2007-08-16T13:01Z,"No,you don't.

Just put this file in your already downloaded BioShock-XBOX360-USA-DAGGER folder and overwrite and than unrar like you usually do."
,KingKobra78,2007-08-16T13:05Z,I mean yes download this torrent but there's nothing wrong with your old one.Just one part of your older download is corrupted.Download this and copy/paste/overwrite in that folder.
,blue_tomato,2007-08-16T14:41Z,"strange, the original extracted fine for me..."
,dradius,2007-08-17T02:22Z,Has anyone gotten this game to work on a hitachi drive? thanks
,AsssKisser666,2007-08-17T15:53Z,"The original unpacked fine for me aswell, do you mean that even if it unpacked fine I need to replace this rar file?? The game is working fine on my 47 hitachi drive!?"
,banhammer,2007-08-17T22:45Z,"A lot of people are saying the other one worked fine, I'd be cautious of this."
,Vader-,2007-08-18T16:34Z,you don't need this....update your pc!!!!!
,khyew,2007-08-19T23:18Z,"I performed a MD5 hash and my original b-dgr.059 is identical to this ""fixed"" b-dgr.059. Either the Bioshock torrent with the broken b-dgr.059 has already been taken down and replaced with one containing this fixed file, or the author received a number of (erroneous) complaints about the original file and uploaded this fix to quit them"
,khyew,2007-08-19T23:21Z,"If your b-dgr.059 MD5 hashes to d8cb641519e5b22ca8dab5fe34e61768, you don't need to download this fix."
,Something12,2007-08-22T13:10Z,"I've got a corrupted file on 40, and can't extract it beyond 55 %
I've downloaded it several times, but the same problem arises each time.
Can anyone help me ? "
,FuckCopyrights,2007-08-26T17:06Z,"Atlas is Fontaine.
You kill Ryan midway through the game, only to find out Atlas/Fontaine manipulated you to do it.
Your player's past is a fake memory, you were made in a lab to do everything said to you when added ""...would you kindly...""
That's why you kill Ryan.
Oh, and at the end, you get to be a big daddy.

The two endings are; you raise all the little sisters into adulthood, or you kill em all for the Adam."
,evr,2007-08-29T01:24Z,FuckCopyrights: You're such an asshole. Don't spoil the story for people. I sure hope nobody reads your comment. I'm just lucky I've already played most of the game so the lines I read didn't spoil anything for me.
