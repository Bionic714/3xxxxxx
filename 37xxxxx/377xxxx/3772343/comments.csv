but...
tried to download this with uTorrent, and got connected to over 20 people with almost the same ip-adress, and all of them used Azureus 2.3.0.6, and none of them was a seeder
strange thing is, they all gave false peices, with hash-errors.
luckily i got connected to a seeder who could help me out with the correct peices, and so i got i down
then if i try to seed this torrent in azureus, and not in uTorrent, i'm not connected to any of them...."
