PART 2: HIJACKERS & PLANES (To come) A 757 dives into the Pentagon, penetrating to its core. Invisible Arabs hijack airplanes, passengers make history and untraceable phone calls. "Elementary, my dear Watson. Let's Roll."

PART 3: WHO BENEFITS (To come) Stock trades and civil rights go haywire. An empire is born as citizens enjoy the perfect Big Sleep. Bogart did say, "all you owe the public is a good performance" But who's backstage?

"Excellent -- the best of the 9/11 movies." --David Ray Griffin

"WOW! is my reaction to this movie. With graphics and interviews, it provides great insight into demolitions and what really happened on 9/11/01." --Professor Steven Jones

"An outstanding contribution to understanding 9/11 -- simply superb." --James Fetzer

90 minutes of pure demolition evidence and analysis, laced with staggering witness testimonials. Moving from "the myth" through "the analysis" and into "the players," careful deconstruction of the official story set right alongside clean, clear science. The 9/11 picture is not one of politics or nationalism or loyalty, but one of strict and simple physics. How do you get a 10-second 110-story pancake collapse?  Â«
