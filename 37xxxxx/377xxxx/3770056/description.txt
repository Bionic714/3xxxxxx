Director Spike Jonze delivers a stunningly original comedy that seamlessly blends fictional characters and situations with the lives of real people: obsessive orchid hunter John Laroche, New Yorker journalist Susan Orlean, Hollywood screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, and his twin brother Donald. As Charlie struggles to adapt to Orlean's best-selling book "The Orchid Thief", he writes himself into his own movie. The various stories crash into one another exploding into a wildly imaginative film. ADAPTATION, the year's most talked about movie, is at once a hilarious drama and moving comedy.
