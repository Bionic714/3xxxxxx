After decades of counseling, Johann Christoph Arnold still marvels at our capacity to make life miserable for ourselves and one another. This book, his tenth, points to a sure way out of life's hells.

Using real-life stories, Arnold exposes the common seeds of loneliness, frustration, alienation, and despair, and gives you the tools to uproot them from your life. In contrast to the makeovers and quick fixes hawked by popular culture, Escape Routes offers a tougher prescription. The choices he presents are clear: "to be selfish or selfless; to forgive or to hate; to burn with lust or with love; to defend your personal power, or dismantle it."

Why stake your hopes on some eternal hereafter, when you can taste heaven right here and now? No matter your problems, or who you are, this book will help you on your way, provided you're ready to take its medicine.

-LEGAL TORRENTS

Purpose:

create a balance, share the already free stuff,
public domain works, freeware, free music,
free ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.

show the copyright owners that torrent
websites shouldn't bear the responsibility
of what their users upload, torrent websites
are very much similar to google..

users upload what they want to upload,
download what they want to download,
and search for what they want to search..

by creating this balance and sharing the already free
stuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..
