,student123,2008-05-30T22:06Z,use avri trimmer to remove extra sound track and recompress using virtual dub + gspot to get the correct timing. Thats if u r using this avi to play on dvd player that reads avi s... now if you want to wacht on the pc there are a bunch of viewers that can mute audio tracks... just not windows media player ...
