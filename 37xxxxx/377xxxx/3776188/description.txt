Legend Of Twins Dragon aka Shuang Long Ji (Yuen Biao, 2007)

July 2007: Xi-an Evening News

Shuang Long Ji/Legend of Twin Dragons (tentative) originally planned for release this summer, has been barred from theatrical screenings in Mainland on the grounds of its violence. The director does not wish to alter the film as it would affect the plot and continuity. It's possible that it will go straight to video instead. On the hand, Universe Films is trying to sort things out with the Mainland censors.

Legend of Twins Dragon is about Leung Bik, the wayward son of Wing Chun master Leung Jaan, who runs away from home in order to learn martial arts and surpass his father. Leung Jaan has refused to teach Leung Bik Wing Chun due to his improper behaviour, despite his natural talent for martial arts. Legend of Twins Dragon is produced by Billy Chan and directed by Sing Chi Chao and Fung Yuen Man, with Tung Wai and Ling Zhi Hua behind the action scenes. Stars Nicholas Tse, Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung, Rain Li, Sammy Hung, Ji Chun Hua, Xu Xiang Dong.
