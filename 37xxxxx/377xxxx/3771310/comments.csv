Do you have any fixes?

Starting with h-pstsX.r00 does not help either. I tried starting from each rar file and result is the same

I had the same problem. I found out that rar nr49 was corrupted. Dont know about your case.. but anyway. Just download that file again. Copy it with the others, and ofcourse delete the old one. And u should be fine:D"
,ManMachine,2007-09-05T00:10Z,You have to mount the ISO with the latest version of ie. PowerISO og Daemon Tools. Otherwise you'll get a 'file corrupted' message.

You need to have the NTSF (XP) discsystem and not the old FAT32 (Win 98/ME). FAT32 cant handle files bigger than 4Gb.

Its possible to convert a FAT32 to NTFS without loss of data....just google how to do it! :D"

well, you'll need one of the newest version of you're ISO program like ISO buster or power ISO.
and winrar
1: download :P
2: unzip it with winrar 
3: extract with your ISO program.
4: if you didn't have any problems with the upper steps you'll see 2 files: 2 maps and one, start here file.
you put them all in the same map and you give it a name, like photoshop dvd 1 (doesn't really matter)
than you start your firefox or internet explorer and you go to file, open file, and than you go to your map and choose: start here.
and voila, 
good luck everybody, hope this will help"

,Simpler4all,2010-05-15T23:07Z,"If you have problems trying to mount it with daemon tool here another way to mount it.

1. Unrar with winrar or whatever you have. (h-psts.part001) Unrar that file. doesn't matter.

2. When fnish unrar, you should see a disc (photoshop topsecret.) GRAB and DRAG the disc file onto your desktop.

3. check desktop to see if file is there. Than mount image with daemon tool by going to desktop and you should see the file.

4.After mounting you should see a yellow file saying open folder to view file. click on it.

5. you see ""start here"" along with ""data"" and ""project file"" Click on ""start here"" than it should work when it opens with firefox or internet explorer."
