,pubis,2007-08-20T21:12Z,I got such a headache after listening to like 3 tracks on this one.. :/ Good upload though! 
,hotwheels47125,2007-08-27T23:01Z,This album is great! Thanks a ton cholo!
,mycarrion2,2007-08-29T03:54Z,"This album doesn't suck for a moment and if it gives you a headache you're too old.  ;)

Mango Pickle(check the kids!), World Town(the correct name for track 8), XR2 and Paper Planes are stellar.  Come Around is absolutely classic.  I dare you to try to get it out of your head once you've heard it.

M.I.A. is changing the game.  Again."
,SuperioR12,2007-09-07T21:56Z,"Shit for sure! Download and be disgusted
Maybe good music for braindeads, wtf..."
,mycarrion2,2007-09-30T20:40Z,"""...braindeads...""

Pitchfork 8.9/10
Rolling Stone 4.5/5
Associated Content 4.2/5
Prefix 9/10

But feel free to your own thinking and searching.  Don't listen to the musically inept few who don't get it.  These recordings are masterful (though perhaps a bit too deep for cave dwellers)."
,goliathnz,2007-10-08T23:27Z,"OMG, it's like midget jungle jigaboos got a hold of a power cord for their bamboo drums....have to hear to believe though!"
,StomiHans,2007-10-29T01:10Z,"Off course you think its sucks, its kind of progressive. Be more open minded you mainstream rats!"
,coollalala,2007-10-29T09:06Z,"wow, some people are morons! this album rocks. well I guess yall are probaly listening to fucking fall out boy and bullshit like that"
,stealnwhine,2007-11-01T07:25Z,"Maya's tour is sold out, worldwide.  All without the ""aid"" of mainstream radio.  If you don't get it, you're a fucking dolt.

On the bright side, the Spice Girls and Britney are back for the simple minded, brainwashed folk.  Yay!"
,josefibbla,2007-12-06T11:51Z,Thanks for a nice & quick upload. Works great!
,mulukku1,2007-12-12T10:06Z,"this is the shittiest album i ever heard it sucks dicks, cocks & penises"
,stealnwhine,2007-12-12T16:56Z,"""...sucks dicks, cocks & penises""

That would be you and your mom.  Go back to our James Blunt cd and suck another.  Moron"
,auntiecoagulant,2007-12-13T22:59Z,"I was turned on to this album by NPR's All Songs Considered from their Best of 2007 show. I'm ""old"" (38) and this album is to me is brilliant! If you're looking for mainstream radio bullshit this album is not for you. If you want some creative pop/dub/hip hop music with excellent use of sound and sampling (and you'll HAVE to be ""old"" to appreciate some of the samples she digs up) then by all means download and enjoy!  "
,beelover9481,2007-12-31T08:21Z,THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM EVER!!! BEST SONG ON THERE IS....ALL OF THEM!!
,Christoffer.B,2008-02-23T21:08Z,"A few good, but the rest suxx :("
,thedriftaway,2008-02-23T22:53Z,"M.I.A. is brilliant. if this is the first time you've ever heard her, be open minded and ready to get down (even in your seat) and definitly read the lyrics to get the full effect of where she is coming from, I suggest reading them on songmeanings.net in case some of the lyrics don't make sense to you, maybe someone has explained them a little. also visit her website. This is the second breakthrough album from this talented artist, and deserves much play and respect. Please take the time to seed it. but most of all ENJOY it. It is a special gift to the ears and hips."
,brendan680,2008-03-02T03:23Z,"I am a 50 year old Irishman and I tell you this is a great sound, she has a great vibe and it is all good so download and enjoy."
,elementnat,2008-03-05T07:41Z,I like to consider myself pretty open minded when it comes to music.  But this album sucks balls.  Great upload.  Bad Album BLAH!!!
,yodayodayodayoda,2008-04-08T22:09Z,"download it and judge for yourself.  it is only 65MB and it is a fast download.  personally, i like it, especially for the gym doing cardio.  it has some really interesting sounds and great beats, without the egos, profanity and other bullshit of american hip hop.  for the record, i am american."
,Smekofc,2008-05-29T20:46Z,getting high to paper planes is the shiznich! ;)

,Daft_Zomb,2010-06-23T23:20Z,"A lot of people are mislead by Paper Planes. If you're into mainstream shit, you'll most likely hate this album. That's fine, just don't bitch about it here, we don't care."
,worldtown,2011-08-22T20:35Z,"Amazing album, her work is phenomenal.  Buy the album."
