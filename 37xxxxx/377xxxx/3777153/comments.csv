,dasxax,2008-02-05T19:26Z,"jancuksd I hope you get to read this.

Thanks for the fix to the ""valve complete pack updated"" BUT there's a mistake in this fix:
we need a good version of
""ep1\half-life 2 episode one.7z.002   64.7 MiB"" 

AND NOT ""episode 1 shared.7z.002  100 MiB"" (which is ok in torrent 3768549)"
,spydogg21,2009-07-28T06:55Z,think some one could seed this please i really need the files
