,edinman,2007-08-16T10:10Z,"I'm having problems loading this game. I get asked to insert disc 2 that has data3.cab file. When I mount CD2 it can't find the required file. I have browsed the image and datra3.cab is there but is a winzip file. I am unable to extract it.

Any ideas/guidance??"
,Elevato,2007-08-18T12:27Z,from which year is this game?
,gladiusarcanis,2007-08-21T04:58Z,"files downloaded perfect, rar'd all, install/setup perfect - using daemon tools to mount cd1 iso...
games loads ship screen and then comes up with error screen with binary and ""cubes"" error window then crashes...   any ideas??  the game even let me fully update everything to newest version but just wont run - weird.  thanks beforehand"
,gladiusarcanis,2007-08-21T05:01Z,"EDINMAN - you need winrar to recognize files,  dont mount cd2 to get data from it, simply browse to folder and select swkotor cd2 iso and ok when installation prompts for it- the data file inside is what the prog wants, not the actual cd.  it works great,  i just cant get the game to start.  hope this helps"
,Rithual-RSG,2007-08-25T14:03Z,"Can't get this started.. I've got the Kotor 2 of yours (raven) to work, but at this it's like this-

,spectermonkey,2007-09-11T03:56Z,"I have the exact same problem!

,carrotcrunch,2008-01-29T00:11Z,"This is the first torrent I've ever downloaded, so for other noobs - a guide in laymans terms.

1) Download the torrent (I used utorrent)

2) Unpack the rar files (I used winrar
-you only need to select extract on the first 'pile of books' and it will create a new folder containing 4 iso files)

3) Burn the iso files (I used nero 7 essentials/smartstart essentials/data/make data cd/hit back button/select 'image,project,copy' icon/disc image or saved project icon/select an iso file from the folder containing isos/burn)

4) Install game from discs following usual on screen prompts.

5) Run the swupdate.exe program from install folder to patch it to current 1.03.

6)This is where it got messy for me - I copied over the replacement exe from the Razor1911 folder on disc 4 to the installed game folder.
It didn't work and windows kept stopping the game as soon as the spaceship appeared.
After 3 uninstalls / reinstalls I Googled 'knights of the old republic no cd crack' and up came a big list.
Fist on the page was a friendly seeming society so I downloaded the 1.03 crack unzipped it and copied it in - hey presto I have a fully working game.

Very pleased"

,goldstorm,2008-03-15T01:22Z,"For Vista, all searches I've done indicated that KOTR II is compatible with 32-bit.  I guess that means this doesn't work on any Vista version."
,stinger839,2008-03-16T12:29Z,"to those having INSTALLATION problems, not in-game or crack issues, I went through this:
Using winrar & Daemon Tools, mounted all the images, but InstallShield would not launch, just show the ""ship screen"" and then demand that I ""Insert Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic - 'Disc 1 - Play Disc' "". I renamed the first ISO thusly, remounted it but was still having the same issue. So I unmounted Disc 2 (disks 1,3,4 are still mounted), ran the renamed version of Disc 1, and that got me to the install screen. When it needed Disc 2, I just mounted it then and everything works fine. 

So if you can't even get to the install screen, try fiddling with what CDs you are mounting or rename the iso if it demands it; I have no idea why it helped (or if it did) but the game runs now. 

some more n00b suggestions:

People having in-game problems: You probably need to install the new patches for KotOR or upgrade your video card driver. Otherwise, running a windowed version of the game, as others have suggested, will help this as well.

People having patch problems: you will probably have to run a manual patch, since this is a crack. So you just need to download patches from the LucasArts site and run them locally.

People having crack problems: google ""hacks"" ""cracks"" etc and after some link clicking, you should have no trouble finding a crack database with the KotOR crack you need."

Just replace the Mss32.dll with a copy from the lucasforums by typing in ""SWKotoR Vista fix"" in yahoo and bring up the right page. cant download directly using firefox, instead save to desktop and rename blah.zip or something like that. this is a sound file which should fix your problems.

Not sure if everything is needed but anyway its how i did it.

1. Unrar. Mount .isos or burn on cd-s.
2. Under CD 1 run setup.exe with xp service pack 2 comp mode + as admin (probably its not nessessary).
3. When asked install directX8b. Restart
4. Update KOTOR with official update
5. Search google for Mss32.dll fix. Download and copy that to your game folder
6. Download 1.3 No-DVD .exe from gamecopyworld.com. Unrar and copy that to your game folder.
7. Open kotor.exe properties and set as run as admin + in xp spack 2 comp mode.
8. Start KOTOR and enjoy. If this fails you can try updating/different versions of video card drivers for any case or find an alternate solution."

,M3rr,2008-09-19T21:55Z,"Well! 

It seems people are driving the ""bitter bus"" at top speed in this topic

Well , let's cover some basics here

1 ) Chances are this torrent works dandy. 
     Not everyone is intellectually well enough endowed to properly double click. However! We shall not hold this against them. 

2 ) Now , referring to us poor cursed Vista users. 
Sure Vista , ... well it's annoying but interestingly enough that Ebon Hawk error is an XP related error.... Go Figure.. It's a problem with the XP File system. Though Vista uses the XP system , it uses an updated version of it that doesn't have something called ""Dynamic Cache Handling"". 

3 ) More interestingly - If your using Vista32 all you have to do (if your really having issues) tell the game to run in XP compatibility mode. 

You can do this by

Right Clicking on the EXE file > Properties > Compatibility > Click the Check box ""Run this in compatibility mode for: "" > Choose XP SP2 from List

The Vista64 fix works if you apply it properly. Using Ultimate my self.
(Actually I'm using Linux / Ultimate / Home / XP Pro SP2) 

Now back to how to easily resolve the Ebon Hawk Error. 

Lower Your Graphics 
if they're at the lowest get the latest patch manually. 

If that doesn't work , Downgrade to the Prior Patch then Manually install the latest. 

Tada - Resolved.

If those don't resolve the issue , your not nVidia.

4 ) The Most Important

It's a Game - Enjoy it! Nothing More , Nothing Less. "

But I have a problem. I've installed the game properly. Using winrar,iso and the no cd crack.

I installed the game crack and last night I was playing it. I started the game up and quickly made a character to see if it was working and it was. Awesome!

So today I start it up and when i press 'game' the message 'Star Wars: knights of the old republic has stopped working'. The ebon hawk shows up briefly and then the screen goes blank and the game is closed.

Im running vista and im running the game in XP sp2 compatibility mode.

Any ideas? help!"
,narmour,2009-01-02T17:12Z,"Okay my problem ^ oif anyone has had similar problems here's the solution.

Control panel > System > Advanced System Settings > Performance > Settings > Data Execution Prevention.

Change to 'Turn on DEP for all programs except the one's I choose :'

Click 'Add'

Go into 'Program Files' Search for lucasarts > SwKotor. When you have opened the Star Wars Kotor folder look for 'swkotor' application file and add it to the list aswel as 'launcher'.

Start game and it should get past the instant crash when loading game. Note: This is for Vista users only.

1. Update drivers
2. Run as administrator on Vista.
3. Your PC may be WAAY to new. Vista/Windows 7.
4. (Vista) Run compability mode as Windows XP or lower. It works on most old games like for example, Diablo 2, Warcraf III etc..
5. Reinstall the game and make sure you didnt do anything wrong. Update the game, get a suitable crack. Download a new torrent aswell perhaps.

Its just one of the things that can help."

,SILENTrampancy,2009-07-11T18:19Z,"Oh, hey, for those of you guys having problems running this game on windows XP, such as frequent and random crashing, i found a really simple solution that so far has had me playing for 3 hours straight.

Simply open the SWkotor.ini in notepad and paste the following under [Graphics Options]:

Disable Vertex Buffer Objects=1


Apparently with graphics hardware of the time when this game was develope ran smoother and faster with this setting activated, so it is by default set to =0, which is enabled. Current graphics hardware, meaning most cards from 2006 on will run into this random crash problem. From what i read on the Bioware site, this problem occurs on many different OS's and the solutions are may be varied. 

For XP user's, this solution has been proven in at least 4 cases. As i said, i ran the game with screen resolution of 1400 x 1050, max AA and AF, and i have yet to have a crash.

I really hope this helps all of you having the crash problem, and i apologize if this solution has been previously stated or if it doesn't work.

"
,SILENTrampancy,2009-07-11T18:22Z,"Sorry for the double post, but i just noticed slkjao's comment.
