,Angertek,2012-08-17T17:08Z,I haven't seen the film but if you say that it is about  programming young American minds to accept communist ideas. Then it must suck because communist ideas in the field of education are much better than any other ever known. Sorry your comment is unclear and it just made me not download this.
