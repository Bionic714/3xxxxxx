[T],insinuendo,2009-07-04T00:24Z,you can get a seeded version on demonoid!
[T],insinuendo,2009-07-04T17:35Z,but the demonoid version pops quite a bit!
[T],insinuendo,2009-07-04T22:18Z,"if this version is clean, i'll post it on demonoid and seed like a mad mofo!

thanks to uploader as well as seeders!"
[T],insinuendo,2009-07-05T00:11Z,"unless i'm crazy, this version is as shitty as the one posted on the demonoid site. 

worth getting to get an idea of what the album sounds like, but frustrating sound quality.

just listen to ""omie wise"" on a good sound system or with earphones and you'll hear what i'm talking about "
