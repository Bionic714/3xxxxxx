Serial key is working but once you start any office application it will then ask you to register/activate your office with a confirmation code. If you do it using internet option it fails saying ""specified product key has been activiated the maximum number of times"".  Has anyone had any luck retrieving a confirmation code? SOME PLEASE OFFER A SOLUTION FOR CONFIRMATION CODE!"
,supsnap,2008-02-04T21:04Z,"Do this it Works with ur 60 days trial MS ofice 2007

First of all make sure that u install Office 2007 without any Serial Number? If u have already installed it with a serial number then follow these instructions?.. 

1. Close all Microsoft Office applications. 

2. Click Start, click Run, type regedit in the Open box, and then click OK. 

3. Locate the following registry subkey:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Registration 

Note You may also find another subkey that resembles the following subkey: 

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Registration\{91120000-0011-0000-0000-0000000FF1CE} 

4. If you find additional subkeys that reference Microsoft 12.0 registration, open each subkey, and then identify the product by the ProductName entry.
For example: ProductName=Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2007 

5. When you find the subkey for the product from which you want to remove the existing product license key, delete the following entries:
* DigitalProductID
* ProductID 

6. Exit Registry Editor. 

After u are finished with this? 

1. Go to start and Click Run? 

2. In the run box type? ?C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\OFFICE12\Office Setup Controller\Proof.en? 

3. You should now see a file named Proof.XML 

4. Right click the file and select open with notepad. 

5. After opening the file with notepad scroll down to the the bottom. 

6. You should see lines like this? 

7.  



8. Just change the line AlwaysInstalled with neverInstalled retaining the quotes? 

9. Save the file and u are ready to go? 

10. Now just open Word and it should not ask you for any activation? 

11. Make sure you do not do any kind of update?"

,camo12345,2008-04-25T20:34Z,"supsnap, i had microsoft office 2007 home and student, i followed what you said, one tiny problem:
when i tried to save the 'neverInstalled' bit it wouldnt let me, i figured a way to do it if anyone else gets stuck like that.
transfer the whole document of 'Proof.en' (the XML file) and put it on the desktop or somewhere else, you should be allowed to do this. Then open it with Notepad, and then you should be able to save it now, then simply transfer the new document (with 'neverInstalled' saved on it) and place it back into the Proof.en folder. Now you can open it as an XML document again and it will say 'neverInstalled'

Also, if anyone has the 60 day trial then that method works perfectly, and usually when your Word opens it says at the top: Free 60 day Trial
Now it will just say Microsoft Word document

I love it, thanks for this site, i only had a week left"

,XOIIO,2011-01-04T15:17Z,"Shit... First serial and it worked! I thoght it would be more complicated, like doing something with the registry so that it would accept. Thanks a million!"
,Silencieux,2011-03-22T02:16Z,"i used one key in the middle, but before trying to find an activation key on the internet i already had one on my cd.

People who find the key dont work; just try this :

1. get a good firewall
2. forbid internet access to microsoft office and help
3. insert the key
4. enjoy :p

So simple to forget that such software really dont have to access internet ^^"
