,RayNHN,2008-02-01T15:54Z,"Hi there, I'm new here and Yesterday i downloaded this movie. The video quality is good, also the sounds. 

Does anyone knows if there is a compatible dutch sub for this movie? The one i got isn't.

-------------------------------------------------

Hallo, ik ben nieuw hier en heb gisteren deze gedownload. Nu ben ik nog op zoek naar de juiste ondertitels, die ik heb gedownload matchen niet met de film. Weet iemand of ze bestaan?

Gr. Ray"
,DARK X,2008-02-13T06:04Z,"RayNHM, don't be a stupid fuckface and learn to use the fucking subtitle workshop program to make the subtitles compatible. It is such a cute and easy program. Don't be a stupid and ugly looking moron and do something for yourself. Trust me, you'll be happy once you learn to use it and you'll lick my sexy ass for the rast of your life, just from gratitude.. Anyway, don't get upset 'cause of the way I'm talking to you. I have exams at my university for the last ten days. Didn't seep for a long time. Just feel like biting everything and everyone. Regards"

,Kiinape,2008-06-15T14:52Z,"I'v download this already two times and this was my 3rd time downloading this movie but still the same proplem appears to me: no sound. It's very annoying when you have the freaking movie whitout any sound, and have waste three days downloading it again and again. Can some1 help me out of this proplem =S ? i would be very thankfull."
,VAD3R,2008-06-25T18:39Z,"Kiinape just download VLC Player, I personally use Nero ShowTime, if you're too spasticated to find out how to use them then you can download Audio Codecs. Tsk. Did you even TRY consulting google? Aka typing in ""no sound in movies"" It's a missing codec you need.

PS. Great movie, never seen it before well I always had the VHS tape but I never got to watch it. Thanks. "
,VAD3R,2008-06-25T18:40Z,PS: The film is 3 Hours long don't complain about the 1.34GB file

,rynem,2009-06-24T08:31Z,"I know I may be late, but what kind of faggot named DARK X talks shit to someone who's just asking a question? You sound like an ignorant moron. You can go F*CK your exams and your teacher. You fucking punk ass bastard. Your name is so cheesy ""DARK X"" supposing you go to University. LMFAO you sound like one of those grade 4 yugioh fans."
,docmatrix,2009-10-26T16:06Z,"@ramprat: Download a BitTorrent client (like utorrent @ www.utorrent.com), download the .torrent file (click ""DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT"") and open the file with utorrent. Tell utorrent where to download the files. When the torrent is completed, utorrent will notify you and voila! You have successfully downloaded a torrent! Now on to audio/video codecs..."
,joka2385,2010-04-23T19:25Z,Downloaded once before and there was no sound. Going to try it again. Video wasn't bad though
,Jblevins90,2010-05-14T07:36Z,"andyell1. i normally dont like to stoop as low as others and tlk shit, but you are wrong to say the film is better. the book uncovers and reveals many secrets and events that dont occur in the book. for those of us who are stephen king fans we know that his boks are better. if you ad actually read the book and earned your own opinion you wld know this. congrats your a douche bag."
,Jblevins90,2010-05-14T07:36Z,"""that dont occur in the film"". my bad i ant type"
,Jblevins90,2010-05-14T07:37Z,"""that dont occur in the MOVIE"". my ba i cant type"
,Deception45,2010-07-26T07:49Z,"Dark X - Go fuck yourself

Kiinape and Tontsa and anyone else with audio or visual issues - Depending on what software your using to play it, you may need to get a different codec for certain movies.  Try downloading and using VLC, it's free and works every time for me.  Hope that helps.

3oh3 - why is there always that one guy on a torrent site that says fuck torrents?  Get off this site you retard

besty7-11 thanks a bunch for the upload, been looking for this movie forever.

For anyone arguing about books and movies - it's a matter of opinion and it will always be a matter of opinion.  So stop arguing about something that isn't entirely based on facts."
,effthesun,2011-01-05T19:10Z,sound problem
,LadyBlackArachnia,2011-06-15T18:02Z,"Hey Dark X, learn to spell. It's rest not rast. If you going to insult someone please learn to spell. I am not genius speller but if your going to be a jerk then at least sound smart! XD It's so sad when people have nothing else to do but insult someone. The only dumb question is an unasked one. You learn by asking so called ""dumb"" questions. Anyway thanks uploader for the upload."
