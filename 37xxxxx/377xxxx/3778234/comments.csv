,Bo Rock,2007-08-20T10:00Z,"use Azureus with the plugin: SAFEPEER

(It is the list from peerguardian)

Much easier"
,Daemon85,2007-08-20T17:57Z,"i would you Azureus too if it wasnt like it sucks all power from your computer, also sucks that you need java crap"
,Uncle_Fucker,2007-08-22T05:15Z,"A ""new"" version of PeerGuardian might be nice if the fuckers at Blocklist.org ever updated their lists. They haven't updated since the end of 2006 as far as I know. Safepeer uses the same list, so it's just as outdated.

Oh, and Azureus only ""sucks power"" from wimpy computers. I use it and don't have any problems at all with multitasking or whatever I choose to do while it's running. Highly recommended in my opinion, if you want total control over everything."
,CRAZYGUY_1001,2008-02-05T17:39Z,"i think this is the version which also works on vista there are bugs but hey it works :D
all u have to do is set pg to log all connections and show them and update the list, you should see the updates logged if not close pg and try again.
azaurus safepeer plug in takes too long to set up utorrent is much better and the ipfilter.dat is much easier to use "
