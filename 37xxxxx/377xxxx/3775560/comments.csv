,oblachubs,2007-08-17T06:11Z,400MB DVD screener?  Sorry even 7-zip wouldn't even be able to compress a good quality movie that much.  This is guaranteed bad quality just because of it's file size...
,rolyandcaroline,2007-08-17T13:17Z,Can someone who has downloaded pass comment on quality b4 I download another unwatchable version!
,thetheory,2007-08-17T13:35Z,"ran it on WMP, Divx Player and VLC. Timecode has been removed, but quality is shit. Download the one with the timecode instead - this one just isn't worth it."
,chips2u,2007-08-17T14:24Z,"the real version is 4.3gb

Files: 	 91
Total Size: 	4,300.34 MB"
,rolyandcaroline,2007-08-17T20:11Z,fuzzy picture but at least the irritating time code has been removed - the picture quality is definitely better in some of the other versions as long as you don't mind a clock running across the screen - least annoying of the 3 downloads I have tried so far
