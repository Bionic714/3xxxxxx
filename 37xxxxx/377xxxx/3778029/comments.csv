,Pyatin,2007-10-09T08:13Z,"This is the same as the others.  Lightly chopped off the beginning, cam covered a few times losing critical plot points, but audio wasn't too bad until you year the jacket or cover over the camera when it is blocked (probably because of an usher passing by). 

Crap that originated from moviex, as usual.  Better versions come from people who rent a private viewing or have a ""theater friend""."
