A must have.

Hajime Kudo is a painfully average nice guy.  He's just graduated

from an average university and is about to enter an average corporate

job.  Fortunately, Hajime has a month and a half off to make this big

transition.  He's miserable, though; he doesn't want to begin his new

life alone.  However, he has no idea where to look for a girlfriend.

All that changes, however, when he sees an add for the May Club dating

service.  At that moment, Hajime resolves to use his vacation to find

the girl of his dreams at the May Club!



May Club isn't just a regular dating service, though, it's a

~virtual~ dating service.  That's right, cutting edge virtual reality

technology is being used to create the perfect dating environment.  As

Hajime, you will enter this virtual world and seek your ideal mate.

Remeber, though, that things may not always be as they seem in virtual

reality; you never know what surprises may pop up.



Controlling Hajime is easy.  You'll decide when he visits May Club and

where he goes once there.  If he runs into any eligible women, you'll

occaisionally have to decide what to say to them.  Make the right

moves and you could end up with the girl for life, or just for the

night.  Happy hunting!
