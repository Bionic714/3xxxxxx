Hunky Dory (Alternative version)
Trade cdr>eac>flac 8>utorrent>MWP

A curio that will be of interest I'm sure. The whole of the Hunky Dory album as alternative versions and outtakes.

Some of you may have some of these already but it's nice to have it all in one place.

Not sure at all where each track is taken from but perhaps some clever so and so could enlighten us.

The quality of the tracks are VG.(imoho)

01 Changes
02 Oh! You Pretty Things
03 Eight Line Poem
04 Life on Mars
05 Kooks
06 Quicksand
07 Fill Your Heart
08 Andy Warhol
09 Song For Bob Dylan 
10 Queen Bitch
11 The Bewley Brothers

To the best of my knowledge:
Life On Mars is from the Hunky Dory CD, Quicksand and Bewlay Brothers are Ryko bonus-tracks, and the rest are from BBC sessions.
