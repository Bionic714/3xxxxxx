I think with this release we have to look at their patcher, has some nice little image on it. If someone can explain what they mean, it would be nice? ;) Anyway nice to see another new group active in the scene!

PHOTORECOVERY┬« was developed as an easy to use application that was designed to recover images, movies, and sound files from all types of Digital Media. It was designed to be compatible with Memory Sticks, SmartMedia, CompactFlash I & II, Micro Drives, SD/XD Cards, Multimedia Chips, Floppy Disks and most other forms of Digital Film. Simply insert your Digital Film into the reader, and run PHOTORECOVERY┬« on the media, and then save the pictures off to another location. There was no easier way to salvage those once in a lifetime moments you thought were lost forever!
