,felch,2007-10-17T19:16Z,fucking rar files - what format are these ebooks in?  PDF?
,TheKingofOblivion,2007-10-18T12:37Z,".pdf, .rtf, and some .txt files, most of the books are in more than one format.

My one minor gripe (the William Gibson section is missing 'Neuromancer') is more than outweighed by the massive selection of other classics and rare gems.  Check out 'The Demolished Man' by Alfred Bester, it's everything a sci-fi story ought to be!"
,xxacidcorexx,2007-10-25T17:16Z,"Best torrent I've downloaded...ever. Such great books in there like R.A Salvatore's Icewind Dale series and Demon Wars series.

,xxek,2008-01-01T21:02Z,"Yes, they are really rar files. Just look (in your torrent-client) WHICH of them are REALLY downloaded in full. It may be also that your version of winrar is too ancient.."
,Tall-Farang,2008-01-04T06:48Z,"Thank You' dtc136. 
If I can get this downloaded, I'll seed it.  I have had my computer on all of the time for about 10 months.  I think that I downloaded every sci-fi and fantay book that I could find on Demonoid.

,tokm-nikita,2008-05-03T21:51Z,"A few small comments on the files about Catherine Asaro:
The file Irresistible Forces is a Collection of six stories edited by Catherine Asaro and including her story Stained Glass Heart. This same story is already included as a separate file.
Echea is a story by Kristine Kathryn Rush, not Catherine Asaro.
Fortune and Misfortune is a story by Lisa Goldstein, not Catherine Asaro.
Izzy and the Father of Terror is a story by Eliot Fintushel, not Catherine Asaro."
,tokm-nikita,2008-05-14T19:46Z,"A few small comments on the files about Jack Vance:

The text in the file ?The languages of Pao? isn?t complete, rendering the present file useless.
(So if anybody has a better version, please post it, and let me know here.)
The files ?Planet of adventure 1-4? and ?Tschai 1-4? are completely identical in content.
The file ?The dying earth? almost the same as the file ?Dying earth 1 ? the dying earth?, but with some small omissions at the beginning and a less appealing layout."
,tokm-nikita,2008-05-14T21:01Z,"A few small comments on the files about Isaac Asimov:

The story ?Fortune and Misfortune? is written by Lisa Goldstein, not Isaac Asimov.
The story ?Winter fire? is written by Geoffrey A. Landis, not Isaac Asimov.
The poem ?Just make then up, see!? is actually called ?I Just make them up, see!?.
The story ?The strikebreaker? is actually call just ?Strikebreaker?.
The polemic ?On the marching morons is included twice in the general Asimov folder. Once with both Asimov and Niven as authors, the second time with only Asimov?s name.
The story ?Hallucination? is included twice. Once in the ?Short Stories? folder and once in the ?Gold? folder, where it belongs logically.
The stories ?Breeds there a man?, ?The feeling of power? and ?All the troubles of the world? are included twice. Once in the general Asimov folder and once in the ?Short Stories? folder.
The collection ?Complete stories? in the general Asimov folder (which actually should be called ?The complete stories?) is the same as the collection ?The complete stories? from the ?Short Stories? folder.
The stories ?The brazen locked room?, ?Potential?, ?My son the physicist? and ?Eyes do more than see? are actually short stories, and should be in the appropriate folder in stead of in the general Asimov folder.
The story ?Gimmicks Three? in the ?Short Stories? folder is actually the same as the story ?The brazen locked room? in the general Asimov folder.
The file ?Asimov?s Choice & De Camp L. Sprague ? The queen of Zamba? has really nothing to do with Asimov."

,mctwitty,2008-08-16T21:35Z,"go here and click on the blue download button

http://www.win-rar.com/download.html

version 3.71 not the 3.8 beta

install, choose a rar archive and double click to open. Use the wizard if you want to extract the file's(ebooks). Just choose the first rar archive and it will find the rest automatically if they are in the same folder   i.e.  choose anthony.rar.1 and it will find anthony.rar.2 anthony.rar.3 etc.....  and unstuff and open them and put the pieces together.

you will need a reader for each type of ebook file.

googlesearch for the extesion...   I.E.  '.lit ebook reader download' or '.pdf reader download'

if you run into problems like this, just type into google your question....    what is the recipe for toll house cookies, or how  do I open rar files .rar files, and you will get a list of answers ranked from most probable/chosen/highest rated.  to the least"

Worth noting: there are misspellings in the list of stories though I have yet to download the individual authors and cannot comment on how they read.  But to put together such a compilation is incomprehensible and I bow to you HOWEVER you may have accomplished this feat!!!!!
Re: wanker and his malware claim- I cannot tell you.  So far the listing (located in the middle of authors files-SEPARATE DL) is fine.  If I were to find something I would let you know specifics.
I will also be downloading in sections but intend to grab the whole bunch and will certainly seed as I go as this collection has some rather rare finds and MY GOD...  I will now have a copy of Heinlein's ""And He Built A Crooked House"".  This story showed me to my favourite love of all time- Robert Anson Heinlein  :-))))))))))))))))))))"
,swamiolsson,2008-11-30T12:05Z,"Just finished DL. There is a problem with unrar-ing some of the files (from Adams to Anthony) - I'll try to download them again. Also, can anyone tell me which program is needed for reading the .lit files? 
Apart from these small problems I'm absolutely astonished abaout this upload. I'm an old danish SF fan with 10 meters of SF on the shelves, but this is much bigger and contains things which is not available anywhere.
dtc136, I love You, and I cannot comprehend how all this was aquired, digitalized and organized, certainly not the work of only One person. And here it is for the taking ... I'll seed five x 5,83 GB.
Thanx thanx thanx thanx ......"

All in all, not a bad collection. Hope to find the stragglers soon. "
,jonte18,2009-02-27T02:28Z,Can you guys please say some really good books in here that are more for adults? Thx
,KingofOblivion,2009-03-12T23:05Z,"jonte18 - depends entirely on where your tastes lie.  Off the top of my head, glancing at the authors:

Horror: Clive Barker 'The Books of Blood', Dan Simmons 'Carrion Comfort', Michael Crichton 'The Andromeda Strain', H.P. Lovecraft 'The Call of Cthulhu'

Pure Sci-Fi: Vernor Vinge 'The Peace War', Hal Clement 'Needle', Philip K. Dick 'Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch', William Gibson 'Neuromancer', Philip Jose Farmer 'To Your Scattered Bodies Go'

""Fantasy"" (no faeries or unicorns) - Tim Powers 'Last Call', Michael Moorcock 'Elric of Melnibone'

Stone Cold Classics - Alfred Bester's 'The Stars My Destination' and Jack Vance's 5-book series 'The Demon Princes' are two of the greatest science fiction revenge stories ever told, and should be read by anyone not already familiar with them.

Just a few suggestions to start your reading.  Enjoy!"

For instance, and I'm *almost* ashamed to admit this, but the last Harry Potter book is not right. The book listed as ""Deathly Hallows"" in the torrent is actually the fake fanfic leak which released prior to the real book's release.

I don't want to seem ungrateful, but after I find even just *one* book I can confirm as fake, it weakens my trust of the torrent as a whole. How many more? How many of these novels will I read and find later I read some incomplete or fake work?"
