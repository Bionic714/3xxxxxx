,huntersthompson,2007-08-15T04:32Z,people who like the fact that most newer dvd players support vcd playback now and you can burn it to a cd-r in less than 10 minutes compared to 2-3 hours to a dvd. not to mention the fact that you can get 50 cd-r's for around $15 were as 10 dvd's cost that much..... 
,0p,2007-08-15T18:00Z,"The xvid format is alot better than old standard mpg-1. And it can be used on cd-r alswell. If your dvdplayer cant play xvid , maybe its time to upgrade to a new one."
,huntersthompson,2007-08-15T19:50Z,id be happy to give you my address if you would like to buy me and everyone else on here who doesnt have an Xvid compatible player...find the format you need and download it simple as that. why worry or complain about a format you arent even interested in?
