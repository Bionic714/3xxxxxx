I ripped this myself. First time. Not sure if it could be better or not. I used Xilisoft DVD Ripper Platinum. Didn't change any parameters or anything. It's good quality I guess, but if you have any suggestions about how to rip stuff the best possible way, let me know right here. Thanks!

Anyway, this is a great show and taken from the brand new Kissology vol.2 which is out now in a store or - internet store - near you. :) Lots of cool stuff on that one.
