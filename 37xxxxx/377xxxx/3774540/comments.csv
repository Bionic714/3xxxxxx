,just_wanna,2007-08-16T13:35Z,Thanks a lot! :D can you ripp more from the new kissology vol.2? I want it so much! :D
,Raul_Anakin,2007-08-16T18:19Z,"Yeah, I'll put out one more thing from it. A couple of songs from the first show ever without make-up. October 1983 in Portugal. I'll do that when I get home from eating crawfish at this crawfish party in town. =)"
,just_wanna,2007-08-16T19:13Z,"okeey, sounds great :P I have lots of Kiss concerts but i don´t know how to upload and make torrents..:S"
,Raul_Anakin,2007-08-17T00:08Z,"I'll tell u how. First, download a program called Maketorrent. You'll find it here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/File-Sharing/MakeTorrent.shtml It's freeware. Then u install it. Open it. Choose the file u wanna upload and where it says ""tracker""; copy and paste this adress: http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce and then press Create Torrent.

Now, make sure u have the torrent and file in the same folder. Easiest is to have em in the folder where u download stuff from Pirate Bay.

Go to piratebay.org and press the link in the bottom that says ""upload torrent"". Follow the instructions there. It's easy. Browse for the torrent on your computer, choose name, category and info etc.

Now, and this is important. Double-click your own torrent u made (the one we put in your piratebay-download-folder). It will open in your torrent-download-program and immediatelly go to 100% and start seeding to your fellow kiss-friends. =)"

,Raul_Anakin,2007-08-17T21:48Z,"No, sorry. But I think a friend of mine has it. I'll ask him if I can borrow it. In that case I'll put it up here. :)"

,Raul_Anakin,2007-08-18T01:46Z,"I have Kissology 1 & 2. I have Kiss Rock the Nation (reunion-tour) and then I have Kiss Animalize tour which was released on VHS back in the days but never (i think) been officially released on DVD. But I have it. That's it, really. :/"
