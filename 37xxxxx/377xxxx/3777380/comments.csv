your fucked you cant use homebrewed on any thing higher than 3.52 so unless u get a pandora battery and install m33 3.52 -4 or 3.40 OE-A 
custom firmwares (not the risk of bricking is  mainly if u dont know what the hell your doing ) 

but no U will not be able to use them"

,Resistance156,2008-04-02T22:23Z,"Thanks whoever seeded, my download finished. I'll seed a while at 10kb/sec (my total upload bandwidth is pretty slow, so I can't afford more than that). I'll check back here periodically if someone needs a seed for this."
