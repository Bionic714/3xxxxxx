,monkiesatemybaby,2007-10-25T02:09Z,"I'll seed for a couple weeks once it's done. Nice upload, I'm looking forward to it."
,rerunnurer,2007-11-01T20:53Z,"Sorry.  I am new to some of this all.  I know I can't fit this ISO onto a regular CD.  That is obvious.  And I know that Gothic II has 3 cd's for installation, originally.  How do I get this single ISO to fit on 3 cd's and have those 3 cd's contain, each, the content that they originally were supposed to contain.  Or, can I burn this image to a DVD and install it and run it?  "
,HomerSp,2007-11-03T21:03Z,"If you have an iso editor you can extract Gothic2-Setup.W02 and Gothic2-Setup.W03 and burn them to two cd's and the rest of the files to another.
You should be able to burn it to a DVD aswell, however if you don't want to waste any DVD's/CD's I'd suggest you use DAEMON Tools which lets you emulate an iso as if it was infact a burned CD. Check their site for more info."
,serpents_of_astaroth,2007-11-08T06:24Z,We need more seeders! Gothic is a great game and i have yet to play the second. Will definitely seed for a long time once its finished.
,serpents_of_astaroth,2007-11-10T18:56Z,"Thanks a lot for this one HomerSp, Absolutely problem free as far as the first game goes (im sure the same goes for the 2nd but i was just in a rush to      play the game again) I will continue to seed until my ISP shuts me down :) by the way this game is the GREATEST action/rpg EVER made in the history of the world."
,HomerSp,2007-11-12T19:55Z,"I totally agree, I'll even dare to say that it's the best game ever made (which might give you an understanding of what types of games I like :P)

I am currently playing the 2nd and I haven't discovered any major bugs/errors so far. So it should work just fine ;)"

,frostburnt,2008-01-28T19:24Z,"Errrm folks I've downloaded just the second game but when i try to run the crack it says SHW32.dll is missing so i can't run the game...Does it have anything to do with not downloading the first game?
Well gothic is like my favourite rpg I have the one and the night of the raven and the third part already installed in here i just need the original 2 to complete the collection so plz help me out"
,HomerSp,2008-01-29T03:51Z,"You don't have SHW32.DLL? If I'm not mistaken that's a windows system file.
You should be able to just download it and put it in your system32 folder (usually C:\WINDOWS\system32)."
,frostburnt,2008-01-29T13:47Z,Thx for that;) Works fine now;) HomerSp dude I can't express my gratitude:P I mean gothic is like on of the best rpgs ever made:P I wanted to play the original II again soooooooo bad!! Thanks again dude.I'll seed for a lifetime:P

,HomerSp,2008-02-06T16:25Z,"It may be outdated, try finding a newer one."

,Circle_Jerk_For_Jesus,2009-08-14T10:47Z,"Zero seeds, but only six leechers . xD . Horrible people, but awesome games none the less. I will seed for awhile but if I am the only one then I'm gonna bail out on this."
,Weralxet,2009-08-16T23:35Z,"back to seeding. sry, was deep in 1st game ^_^"
,Evarda,2010-07-30T12:27Z,"i have a problem with the first game, when i start playing it , after a while my character stops moving and i can't use a button anymore in the game. Any idea how i can fix this?"
,Reno_T,2010-09-06T06:00Z,"So I have Gothic 1 and 3 on my system, I was checking into this SHW32.DLL file, turns out both the games have those files in it's directories but the Windows folder doesn't. I'll install the game and if it asks for the file it's possible to get it working with copying one of those DLLs into Gothic 2 main directory."
