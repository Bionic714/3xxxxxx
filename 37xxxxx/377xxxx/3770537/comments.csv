,TimBioSS,2007-08-13T03:27Z,Does it work on a G5 ?
,jumpingtomato,2007-08-13T08:43Z,"I think you have to download and install the whole iLife 08 before you can go ahead and use this, right?

@TimBioSS see link for iLife '08 http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3766670/iLife__08"
,flamesong,2007-08-13T12:38Z,"Thanks but just to save anybody downloading this unnecessarily, it will not work on my dual 1.42Ghz G4. That might give some kind of benchmark for others."

,snizenja,2007-12-01T11:02Z,Works on my g4 1.33. Thanks.
,Herrin,2007-12-21T14:38Z,Does this work in Leopard? Have had trouble with the old version of g4 cracked that did work on tiger. Hmmm. I like most people did buy I life but had to seek out a crack. Why oh why if someone can make a hack that works didn't apple make one???

,DinosaurKnight,2008-03-16T21:38Z,"This is a LIFESAVER!  I paid cash money for iLife 08, only to get it home and find that iMovie (the ONLY app that I really NEEDED; I'm sure I'll use the rest, but I could live without them) wouldn't install on my G4.  I'm not in a financial position to buy a new computer at the moment, so I was pretty frustrated about it until I found this."
,Chace90,2008-03-19T17:47Z,Does anyone know if this application version is updatable?
,q8pride77,2008-03-21T16:09Z,"this doesn't work on G4 machines with Leopard installed.. just bounces a lot and then quits.

but thanks anyway."
,ibimba,2008-03-31T18:19Z,"how about a new crack for G4 machines running leopard? will save me having to buy a new computer!
Thanks"
,diceofthemoon,2008-06-28T07:52Z,"I love eveything I've heard about this software. But, when I try uploading it on my desktop it doesn't work. I tried Stuffit expander, but, it doesn't recognize the file. Can anyone help me fill in the gaps?
