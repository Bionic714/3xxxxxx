Celtic Offspring is a Canadian outfit who's Miss Gnomer features the tackiest leprechaun ever to grace a CD cover. Thankfully that's the most tasteless part of the project as the rest is highly ingenious and promising. The band is a quartet based in Ontario playing Irish and Scots instrumental tunes and their own vocal and tune material. They are quick on pace changes within a set from reel to jig and back again as in 'Hag at the Churn', displaying an ability to reroute before returning to main theme something akin to The Tannahill Weavers. However this Canadian outfit's musical strains are less obviously boisterous and subtler with clever balance of pipes, fiddle and stringed instruments. There is a good proportion of original songs with five songs written by Ed Nicol with strong vocal harmonies and sounding not unlike Spirit of the West.
