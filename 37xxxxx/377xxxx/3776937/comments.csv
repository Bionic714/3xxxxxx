I got this message as well, but one thing I noticed when using the included [k] to patch After Effects (which seems to have worked fine so far, btw) is that it renamed the application so that its extension was "".ap"", instead of the proper "".app"". I changed it back in the Get Info window, and opened After Effects again, and it started cleanly without any error messages. Hope this helps for you as well!"

,platypusplatypus,2008-03-10T00:43Z,"OK.

This is the Pre-Release Beta Version of Adobe After Effects CS3. It does not come with half of the new plugins that now ship with CS3. MAINLY Keylight, which is a high end plugin from the Production company The Foundry. 

This works fine for the most part, it can be a little cranky when you start it up and it notifies that the application has been moved and would you like to repair it. YOu can say ""Yes"" or ""Cancel"" and it still starts up.

However, this application is useless if your after the new features in CS3. Your better off getting a full version of AE 7 working with all the plugins (*INCLUDING KEYLIGHT*).

'phiebs' did a great job as this is the only torrent out there for AE CS3. HOWEVER, THIS IS A PRE-RELEASE BETA VERSION THAT IS A LITTLE QUIRKY.

1. Mount and Install the ""After Effects CS3.dmg"" file just like you would normally install any Adobe Product.
2. Once the AE is installed, DO NOT RUN OR ENTER ANY SERIALS. Make sure the program is completely closed.

Phiebs, thank you for this torrent.

If you have this error:

you must change the permission of ""AfterFX"" (read and write for everyone)

Phiebs, thank you for this torrent.

If you have this error:

Vous devez changer les permissions du fichier en question

1- ouvrez le paquet de l'application After Effects CS3 puis allez dans Contents/Frameworks/AfterFX.framework/Versions/A/

2-Selectionner ""AfterFX"" puis Fichier>Lire les information (pomme+I)

3-changer les permissions en mettant Lecture&ecriture pour tout le monde.

Voilà le probleme est réglé, vous n'avez plus qu'à appliquez le patch"

so you go to ..
After Fx - right click -> show package contents
contents -> Frameworks -> AfterFX.framework -> Versions -> A -> and then you right click the gray square that says ""AfterFX"" and change the permissions on THAT (not the actual application)

to everyone who has permission errors with leopard (OS 10.5) and the new leopard crack ofcourse

go to the ""error"" directory (open package content etc.)

/Applications/Adobe After Effects CS3/Adobe After Effects CS3.app/Contents/Frameworks/AfterFX.framework/Versions/A/AfterFX

--> get info
--> look at sharing and permissions
--> unlock
--> change admin Rean only into Read&Write

PROBLEM SOLVED!

good luck all!!!

,tukka74,2010-02-27T01:38Z,"I have just downloaded and installed this on a PPC Mac OS X 10.4.11

This is how.

1.. Mount aftereffects_cs3_p1_041607.dmg.

2.. Install program. (It asked me to insert CS4 Disc. I have got CS4 master collection so i inserted this and installation completed)  

3.. Open Adobe Affter Effects 8.0.0 (247) [k] (Universal). And double click on AE icon.

4.. Drag installed version of AE into drop zone. (A warning comes up about permissions need to be changed. I just clicked OK Fix Permissions) 

5.. The App is now cracked but it has a file extension .ap  This causes a warning to come up when you launch AfterEffects. The warning says something like ""Application has been moved"" To fix this you need to change the file extension to .app

All done."

Also the patch will patch all but 1 file, the one pertaining to framework a, then when I open AE it says my serials are no good and inserts the  old ones for me already. I am new to mac is there a place like a registry I can delete something. Also do you think this what is causing my problems? I am running os 10.5.8.

,Derf_Man,2010-09-06T02:12Z,"For those of you still trying to use this old file, realize that CS3 has been replaced with CS4. However I can't find AfterEffects CS4, so this seems like the only option.

If you are having trouble, perhaps these notes will help.

Download the torrent, you'll get two files: one is the aftereffects_cs3...dmg to install, the other is Adobe After Effects...zip to crack the program so you don't need a serial.

Install the program with the dmg file. Unzip the zip file - you'll get a file ""Adobe Affter Effects 8.0.0 (247) [k] (Universal)"". Double click it and drag the AE icon off to a folder/desktop. You will now have a file ""Affter Effects 8.0.0 (247) [k].""
(Alternatively you can choose to 'view contents' and browse to MacOS and remove the file there.)

This is the patcher file, it patches the Adobe program file, HOWEVER, it was built using ipatch 3.7, which is NOT Leopard (or Snow Leopard) compatible. 

If you are still running Tiger (which was what was out in 2007 when this torrent was made) you can just double click the patcher file, and a window will pop up with a ""drop zone"", then browse to /Applications/Adobe After Effects CS3/, and drag the ""Adobe After Effects"" icon (498.1 MB) onto the drop zone. It may complain about needing to change permissions, say yes, enter your password, and the file will patch.

If you are running Leopard, you need to update your patcher with a new (3.7.1 version) of ipatch. 

Step 1: make a duplicate of your patcher file - I called it ""junk"". This is a junk file.
Step 2: Go to ipatch.org and get version 3.7.1 (compatible with leopard). mount the .dmg file you downloaded (double click it) and double click on on the utility iPatch.
Step 3: under 'original' choose the original AE patcher file. Under 'modified' choose the junk file. Create the patch - save it as something else, like 'Use me'.
Step 4: now you need to steal the ipatcher file from this newly created patch, so choose 'show package contents' for the file 'Use me', go to Contents/MacOS and you'll see ipatcher.
Step 5: Now, go to the window that has your AE patcher, and click show contents. Navigate to Contents/MacOS and replace the ipatcher file here (3.7) with the ipatch file in the new 'Use me' patcher that you just went to above.

You can now run the patcher and drag the After Effects App onto the drop zone. You'll see a message in green saying it successfully patched your program."
