,Serrated,2007-09-04T11:11Z,"The firmware and the update installed no problems for me!  

It's developed by a Russian team called ""M33.""  I heard Dark Alex supports them.  

Other than the fact that for newer games we will be needing 3.52 sooner or later I think the only advantages are better ""no UMD"" capabilities, as well as some other stuff.
