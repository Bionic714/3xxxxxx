EditPad Lite is a convenient, carefully designed text editor and Notepad replacement.

It has all the features a solid text editor needs without any bloat.You can open as many files at a time as you want, with no arbitrary file size limit and no arbitrary line length limit. You change between the open files by clicking on their tabs. No hassle with heaps of overlapping windows.

If you want, EditPad Lite limits itself to one instance, saving you a lot of task switching, and keep an icon visible in the system tray, for quick access.Save time with the Search and replace that can work across all open files. Reduce frustration with the unlimited undo and redo, which can undo changes even after saving them.
EditPad Lite is fully globalized. You can convert between ANSI, ASCII and Unicode (UCS-2 and UTF-8), and work with Unix and Mac files. Create text files in any language you like, whether that┬┤s English, French, Russian or Chinese). EditPad Lite itself has also been translated into many languages, including all documentation.

-LEGAL TORRENTS

Purpose:

create a balance, share the already free stuff,
public domain works, freeware, free music,
free ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.

show the copyright owners that torrent
websites shouldn't bear the responsibility
of what their users upload, torrent websites
are very much similar to google..

users upload what they want to upload,
download what they want to download,
and search for what they want to search..

by creating this balance and sharing the already free
stuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..
