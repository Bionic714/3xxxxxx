This is an Excellent movie showing how AA started and how it works. It Shows non AA people how the program works. The two actors who played Bill and Bob are very believable as recovering alcoholics too. I wish everyone would watch this movie so they could see how the program works and so they would understand why people want to go to meetings the rest of their lives.
