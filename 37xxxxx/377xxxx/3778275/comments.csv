,salpern,2008-01-08T03:29Z,"This isn't working and I'm not sure if the 268.34 MiB is full length and of equal quality.  Please advise.  I've got the tape but prefer DVD quality, ideally a rip of the original dvd files.  To the newcomer, most of the libraries I've checked have copies of this movie - it's a great movie, too. (I'll be 21 years clean & sober 1/1/0/2008 - welcome to the ""club."" As has been said, ""It works, it really does."")"
,Dig62,2008-01-09T04:44Z,"This is a good quality dvd rip and downloaded very fast for me.  Many thanks to the OP.  Well worth watching.  Salpern, the full download is 700mb so I think yours got corrupted somewhere along the way.  I'll seed this for as long as I can.

,mc5,2009-07-31T00:58Z,"Don't be sad if this dowesn't work, that is the whole point, concerning AA and other 12 step trash. 

They just wanna transform you into zombies without any own thought. ""Just do what we say, and everything will be ok"" Hahahahahaha

Bill W was a loser then and is a loser now.

To follow a man like Frans Buchman (the constructor of the Oxford Movement), who gave Hitler credits for the ""morality cleaning up"" he did, is just way to much.

How can anyone beleive this crap?

And, tuberok - i don't complain on you, just the crap you uploaded"
,alyciadad,2009-08-25T19:44Z,"Quote from MC5 - ""And, tuberok - i don't complain on you, just the crap you uploaded""

I don't see how you can complain about anything, YOU HAVEN'T UPLOADED A SINGLE TORRENT!!! and yet here you are ragging on someone who takes the time to share. 

YOU ARE A LOSER! Go crawl back in your hole and quit trying to bring good people down!"
,mc5,2009-09-05T09:32Z,"alyciadad - you must be drunk.

and i have uploaded films here, but you are to drunk to find it.

bill w - the man that recommended LSD to cure alcoholism.

bill w - the man who said that it takes at least 7 years to sober up from alcoholism. and the same man wrote that shitty big book, after 2 years of recovery. bill w and his brain damaging sect is just a bunch of dinosaurs"
,Vulcan262,2009-10-08T20:28Z,"@mc5.
The system does work, it depends on the person, you can either be a zombie as you put it or you can live, it is your choice, but the program does work if you work it. But the program isn't for all. You have to choose if it is right for you. Not saying you personally, but to all in general, who has the problem. Not every program works for everyone, each person is different. Have tolerance to that, and not belittle anyone, doing that shows you have the small mind. If you want to help someone, be positive, at least tuberok is trying to be just that, a positive person, and trying to get a movement going along that, appreciate that and not tear someone down because of YOUR shortcomings.

,mc5,2010-07-21T18:46Z,12step is a religious cult
,12stappen,2010-11-15T07:34Z,"@mc5

I think you're a frustrated addict, for whom the program didn't work.

But you keep coming back, and that is a good sign! :p"
,seroazar,2011-03-05T20:40Z,"tottally Agreed 100% with Vulcan.
Mc5, u better dont play with the 12steps.
But maybe when you just say a negative thinks, i dont see it like a program o such as a real positive comment, anyway, you are tottally welcomed to be honestly, and work! with YOU, not with the steps !!"
,seroazar,2011-03-05T20:42Z,PD: i must be forgotten to say  thanks tuberok thanks !
,tobalo,2012-08-13T07:49Z,Thank you for sharing this beautiful movie. One day at a time!
