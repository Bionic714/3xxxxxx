for more info...

this is missing the bonus section about the \"RAVE\" act ...
Reducing Americans Vulnerabilty to Ecstasy...

Donnie was indicted on Federal charges by the United States Government for promoting music and he beat the charges...

Even William F. Buckley uber conservative republican asshole was on the side of Donnie and against United States Attorney Eddie Jordan who
made the UNCONSTITUTIONAL indictment(now he is district attorney of New Orleans)...

A MUST HAVE FOR ANY ELECTRONIC MUSIC FAN!!!!!!!

I will but the bonus feature about the criminal stuff up soon...

This movie is from the year 2000 so its old news but definitely a historical document for any fan of the scene....
