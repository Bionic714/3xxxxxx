,Minerva.TheGift,2008-04-08T19:15Z,"Thanks for the torrent! I have looked through this and compared it with a print copy of the core rulebook, and it matches (in other words, this is the real deal.)  Check out http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4095862/Starships_of_the_Galaxy_(Saga_Edition).pdf for the Starships of the Galaxy companion book.  I've seeded to a ratio of about 2.25 and I'll keep on seeding for a while.  Thanks again!"
