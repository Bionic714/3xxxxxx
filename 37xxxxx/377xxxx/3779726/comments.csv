,jessepsv,2009-01-11T20:11Z,"dzombie shut up.. you're just a dumbass.. this is way better than split tracks btw, but there is a cue file for those who are whining about the one hour track.. 
So if you download medieval cue splitter you can have your splitted tracks..

So stop complaining about quality if you don't know what you're talkin about please.."
