[T],Pongydog,2008-04-27T19:53Z,"I don't think most people would call ""being in widescreen"" a problem. Who in this day an age still wants a crappy pan-and-scan transfer? Give me widescreen anyday.

I'm still pissed off that I spent all day yesturday downloading a version of First Blood II, to find out in was fullscreen. :( (at least I manged to find a widescreen version at another website)."
