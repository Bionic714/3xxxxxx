,Thugangeldk,2007-08-17T15:15Z,"Hello! When I try to unrar these files it gives me the following error. This problem is present on all versions except DVD1!

What to do?

Do you have any fixes?

Don't tell me I downloaded 20GB of nothing? :-( Disk 1 is great though :-)!

PHOTOSHOP.TOP.SECRET.DVD.3-HELL\h-psts3.r01: You need to start extraction from a previous volume to unpack pstsc.iso

PHOTOSHOP.TOP.SECRET.DVD.X-HELL\h-pstsX.r01: No files to extract

Starting with h-pstsX.r00 does not help either. I tried starting from each rar file and result is the same


Note: X stands for the disk number, for example: PHOTOSHOP.TOP.SECRET.DVD.X-HELL is PHOTOSHOP.TOP.SECRET.DVD.1-HELL"
,hansdegebruiker,2007-08-17T15:19Z,"dvd 2, 3 and 4 are nuked broken not working.
I treid everything but there seems to be a RAR part missing and it will not extract.
I also tried to load the dvd's in winmount but that didn't work either.
We have to wait on another release :(((("

,Kalima9,2007-08-17T16:26Z,Start Extraction from .Rar to get past errors.
,Thugangeldk,2007-08-17T19:59Z,"Kalima9, you are my hero! Thanks!

All other people, this is the solution:

Extract the file with RAR extension! Then it should work!!"
,hansdegebruiker,2007-08-17T20:39Z,tried to start from every file now but nothing happens :(

When you have trouble unraring the PHOTOSHOP.TOP.SECRET.DVD.X-HELL\h-pstsX.r01 files 
Just copy the bat file into folder where the .r01 files are and double click.
Then unrar and enjoy."
,ManMachine,2007-08-27T03:37Z,"The XTRA dvd worked fine, but so far both #1 and #3 fucks up.

,racsam,2007-09-19T21:35Z,"I got 1 and 4 to work, but 2 and 3 still don't work even with .bat file to rename the rars.
WTH?"
,cybertrollet,2007-10-30T22:49Z,"All the Top Secret DVD`s are working.

First. Make sure you got the new .BAT file, its a file worth perhaps 20kb, 
you need this in the folder in every DVD.

Its make PS believe that u already have installed the CD1... Think this is the most of the problem for you all. 



The BAT file is called ; hell dvd 2 to 4 fix




Unrar the last file in the folder that is .RAR

Use Magic Iso to excract it again. 

After that, delete downloaded files, open the ""xplorer/firefox file :-) 

Do not touch the large file there :-)
