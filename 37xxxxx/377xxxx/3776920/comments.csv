1. Transfer the .jad and .jar files to the 'Other Files' folder on the phone.

You can transfer the files from Samsung PC Studio's 'Phone Explorer', Windows Bluetooth File Transfer or just transfer it straight to the memory card and move it over to 'Other Files' from the phone's menu.

Create the .jad file with 'Jad Maker' program included.

2. Exit all menus and type in this code: *#9998*4678255#. (*#JAVA*INSTALL#)
You should now get an 'Activated' message. Java install is enabled.

3. Go to the 'Other Files' folder and select the .jad file (should be 1kb).
Press 'Options' (left touch key) and you should get a 'Do you want to install' question.
Press 'Yes' to install.

4. To deactivate the Java install, simply type the same code again.
You should now get a 'Deactivated' message.

Apparently the E900 is similar except the code to install is *#9998*5282# -> install MIDlet password: 235282

plenty of more comprehensive install guides on the net.

,robbo_nz,2007-08-18T09:23Z,"EDIT:
On my D840 it was *#9998*52824678255#.
(*#9998*JAVAINSTALL#)
and the U600 it was *#9998*4678255#
(*#9998*INSTALL#)

,robbo_nz,2007-08-18T15:28Z,"I have a D600 too and some will work but not all. Check H0CKEYS list on here for some D600 games. I have a good pack with some new games for the D600 I may upload later. Also see Flobots (google) for a good Bluetooth guide to install and some other games to DL.

thanx in advance"
,jsc248,2008-05-13T15:10Z,"For the E900
First use the JAD maker in this folder to create jad files for the games you want. Use drag and drop, simply drag the jar. game file onto the JAD maker box. Then bluetooth the jar. and jad. file for each game to your ""other folders"" on the handset. 
Type *#9998*5282#
Install Midlet
Password 235282
Then click on start and enjoy!"

,dahti00,2008-09-04T09:49Z,"Well i have F489 Touchwiz.
Basically no jouystick so most games suck on it. If anyone have troubles with unlocking their phones. Do what I did, upload the games on a server connect to it with your phone, and install the games from WAP. Sure it costs about 1/2 euro in data traffic cost but much easier."
