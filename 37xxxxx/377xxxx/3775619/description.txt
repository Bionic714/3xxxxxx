SYNOPSIS:	"For what I am about to receive, may I make myself truly thankful"
Based on the play by Peter Barnes (also wrote the screenplay).  Pillar of the English establishment, Ralph Gurney, 13th Earl of Gurney, meets his end in a rather embarrassing accident.  His title and estate fall to his sole surviving son, Jack Gurney.  The only problem is that Jack has been as mad as the proverbial hatter for the last eight years, and fancies himself to be Jesus Christ.  As various members of his circle scheme both for and and against him, Jack comes to a crisis of faith (in himself, of course).  Crisis over, Jack seems to be returned to his former sane, but still eccentric, self.  Or is he?
