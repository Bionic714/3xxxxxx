,makka76,2008-03-03T04:20Z,Thankyou for upping this great but hard to find film:)
,khoward1,2008-08-24T16:46Z,"Yes agreed - great film.

But the last 5-10minutes is missing from this avi!

I was in a state of shock after sitting through 2 hours of such a great film with friends whom I have told what a fantastic film it is to be cut off at the knees!"

,sciubba,2009-03-22T04:41Z,"Please seed this. Thanks, great film."
,moreisless,2009-08-20T03:16Z,Excellent! over 2.30 hours. I had to remove it because of low disc space but I intend to return it to seed soon. I just need some tips on how to upload; I'm new to this.. fantastic performances. Thanks so much
,CaptButler,2009-08-23T18:54Z,"moreisless:  Thanks for your interest and thanks in advance for seeding.  All you need to do is copy the file and the torrent back on your hard drive once you have cleared enough space, then load the torrent (right click on ""Open"") back in your client (uTorrent, Azureus, etc.).  After a check, the torrent should start seeding."

....be my guest for further on comments..."
,CaptButler,2010-07-17T16:32Z,"CODYBOSS1969:nDon\'t know why I didn\'t notice your comment before (sorry).  I\'ve never been that concerned with credit personally, although I can understand why others would be.  This file would not exist if it had not been for the effort of another filesharer who upped the full ISO of the DVD from which I made the AVI file.  There were a couple of other AVI torrents out there at the time, but both were for smaller size files (and likely inferior quality), and were leeched out anyway.  These three torrents have long since disappeared.nnI\'m just glad mine is still around and doing well.  If others want to steal the file and the credit, let them.  I\'m just glad they thought it worth stealing.  ;)"
,scottielass,2011-02-09T15:42Z,So thrilled to see this here - I saw it when it was originally shown in theatres and have wanted to see it again. I remember so vividly O'Toole's brilliant performance. Thank you very much.
,frogshare,2011-06-08T11:39Z,A must see.
