,Dj_supream,2008-04-25T19:49Z,"the reason why you cannot write you playlist is that it has NOT been cracked correctly, will on some installs let you write a few disc,s but then stops, it,s the same with ALL the Mixmeister progs , only way round it it export your playlist and copy files as well to folder and use nero to burn it ,dont forget to tick NO GAPS, hope that helps"
