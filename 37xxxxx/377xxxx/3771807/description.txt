Well known group CORE have released MixMiester Fusion + Video. I think this program looks the goods for any wannabe DJ out there! It?s not too big either, weighing in at roughly 78mb.

MixMeister Fusion + Video is the ultimate audio and video mixing system for live DJ performances. Built on top of our groundbreaking MixMeister Fusion software, this add-on module lets you mix full-motion, beat-matched videos right alongside your audio mix.

Play hands-on or hands-off. Fusion + Video lets you control exact video sequences and transitions, or you can use the montage builder to automatically create video mixes in perfect sync with the beat. This feature is perfect for displaying lots of short ambient or psychadelic clips in sync with a song.

Program Features:
# Display your video show on a primary or secondary display.
# Control type & timing of video transitions (cuts, wipes, fades, dissolves, etc.).
# Use live, on-the-fly looping controls, or cut, copy and paste video.
# Display promotional text on the fly.
# Display photos
