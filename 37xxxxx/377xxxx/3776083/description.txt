Plot: In a criminal justice system where criminals go free, lawyers and judges make deals as a matter of routine, and the innocent sometimes go unprotected, young lawyer Arthur Kirkland begins to wonder where the justice has gone. Arthur (Al Pacino, in a brilliant 1979 Best Actor OscarÂ«-nominated role) is an honest, idealistic lawyer who is suddenly under pressure to defend a distinguished judge (John Forsythe) accused of raping and battering a young girl - and whom Arthur knows is guilty. Jack Warden co-stars as an eccentric, cheerfully suicidal judge who thinks Arthur should play the game. When it comes down to the trial, Arthur must choose between the security of his career and his personal integrity. The final, explosive courtroom scene is unforgettable!
