Much appreciated. If you have access to Lynda.com please keep the Adobe CS3 tutorials coming..."
,sam.doran,2007-09-13T06:22Z,"I just put up this training with the all the exercise files extracted and with the GUI files. It's all one zip file; no zipped exercise files inside a RAR file. Simple. I hope that makes it better for you.

ANy chance you can make just the GUI file available to complement this download..."
,aviator_dude,2007-11-02T03:03Z,"Thank You very much for this!
Great lessons.  I seem to have all of the videos.
What I did was just Right Click and Extract the ISO file.

Cheers"
,sknevne,2008-01-17T05:43Z,"tutorials are great, fast-paced with no babystepping/handholding.

no complaints about accessing these movies. if it's really that much of a hassle to open each file, go pay for a sub to lynda.com and stfu."
