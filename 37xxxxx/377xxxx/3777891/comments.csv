,Sieber,2007-08-19T21:01Z,I am seeding with a constant 60-80 K ;)
,Isiklik,2007-08-19T22:55Z,"Hei.

I got the file with no extension.
In what format it is?
Installer, or package, or ... ?

Tnx"
,Sieber,2007-08-20T00:16Z,Installer
,TorrentLover1983,2007-08-20T07:39Z,"Thanks for the upload... I added the .pkg exstention, but when I open it with the installer app nothing happens...
What am I doing wrong?
Thanks!"
,kevinm1,2007-08-20T08:52Z,"Again, how do u install this? I don't know what extension is an installer file."
,ituner,2007-08-20T21:55Z,seems to be some kind of carbon-based installer program for powerpc. but i think bittorrent killed the resource fork...
,kevinm1,2007-08-21T00:56Z,Yeah looks like the file got messed up. 
,TorrentLover1983,2007-08-21T03:20Z,"Sieber, can you either fix this torrent, or can the rest of us just stop seeding this? If it doesn't work, it's just a waste of bandwidth... Too bad though, I wanted to see this."
,dgghostkilla,2007-08-21T04:22Z,"got a question.
so what about all the updates. ilife 08, aperture update 1.5.4 
iweb update 2.0.1,
front row update 1.3.1, iphoto update 7.01
i this are new updates but i dont know if i should update since i donwloaded ilife 08 and got the aperture s/n here on the site.
if i do will it not work anymore?

,xxMicroxx,2007-09-27T00:27Z,"Nothing worth seeing. I extracted the images with FileJuicer and the sounds too... just a bunch of sounds of chicks moaning....

The DVD icon says ""Sex with Grandma""
and the Pictures icon shows a pic of a chick in a thong witht he caption ""Your Mom (i did her last summer)

This is a cheaply made offense in the form of something promising. Nothing to see."
