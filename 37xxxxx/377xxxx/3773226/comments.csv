,hansdegebruiker,2007-08-16T19:38Z,"Can somebody help me please.
When I want to unrar these files I get this message

PHOTOSHOP.TOP.SECRET.DVD.4-HELL\h-psts4.r01: You need to start extraction from a previous volume to unpack pstsd.iso
PHOTOSHOP.TOP.SECRET.DVD.4-HELL\h-psts4.r01: No files to extract

Are the files corrupt or do I need a other compressiontool to extract?

I downloaded dvd1 from torrentsworld

And this one works fine."
,softsofty,2007-08-17T11:54Z,Start with h-psts4.r00
,Thugangeldk,2007-08-17T15:18Z,"Hello! When I try to unrar these files it gives me the following error. This problem is present on all versions except DVD1!

What to do?

Do you have any fixes?

Don't tell me I downloaded 20GB of nothing? :-( Disk 1 is great though :-)!

PHOTOSHOP.TOP.SECRET.DVD.X-HELL\h-pstsX.r01: You need to start extraction from a previous volume to unpack pstsc.iso

PHOTOSHOP.TOP.SECRET.DVD.X-HELL\h-pstsX.r01: No files to extract

Starting with h-pstsX.r00 does not help either. I tried starting from each rar file and result is the same


Note: X stands for the disk number, for example: PHOTOSHOP.TOP.SECRET.DVD.X-HELL is PHOTOSHOP.TOP.SECRET.DVD.1-HELL"
,hansdegebruiker,2007-08-17T15:21Z,"dvd 2, 3 and 4 are nuked broken not working.
I treid everything but there seems to be a RAR part missing and it will not extract.
I also tried to load the dvd's in winmount but that didn't work either.
We have to wait on another release :(((("
,ProperX,2007-08-17T15:42Z,"There is a fix, check forums. can't post linkie here for some reason.."
,Kalima9,2007-08-17T16:27Z,Start Extraction from .Rar to get past errors.
,Thugangeldk,2007-08-17T19:58Z,"Kalima9, you are my hero! Thanks!

All other people, this is the solution:

Extract the file with RAR extension! Then it should work!!"
,hansdegebruiker,2007-08-17T20:41Z,give a litlle hint please for that forum 
,ProperX,2007-08-17T21:48Z,"at the bottom right there's a link for the forum :)
its at suprbay org.

what you need to do if you can't solve the problem is to rename all the files.
do this:
rename h-psts1.rar -> h-psts1.part001.rar
rename h-psts1.r00 -> h-psts1.part002.rar
rename h-psts1.r01 -> h-psts1.part003.rar

etc
extracting it should be fine for any users then :)

This is a big manual job, but if you know a little excel and command line you can make a bat file..

I have made bat files for all the renaming, and there's a link on the forum for it with a readme file which explains what you need to do :)"
,hansdegebruiker,2007-08-18T00:52Z,OEh aaaaahhhh found that forum folowed that link found that fix it worked yes thanks to the man/woman that fixed may you get all the luck of the world you are great.
,hansdegebruiker,2007-08-18T01:08Z,ProperX you are the best. May you get a lot of luck and happines in your life. thanks a lot
,ProperX,2007-08-18T02:44Z,"well, if I first mess something up I'd like to clean it up too :)
please spread the word so most people won't be disappointed when downloading this!"
,Pictureman2,2007-08-18T12:04Z,This is really GREAT....works perfect!! Thanks to elsebasbe!! Very nice lessons in working with photos and what you can do with your fantasy.
,duhprane,2007-08-18T17:50Z,"DVD 2 3 and 4 are all fucked up. Ive downloaded all dvds twice, #1 is corrupt iso but fixable, dvd 2 3 and 4 are just garbage rar files are corrupt and assembled like a retard would do, where you have to have all rars from dvd 2 3 and 4 to extract, this is crap"
,duhprane,2007-08-18T20:24Z,"WELL, I renamed all the rars in the suggested manner graciously posted above, and it now asks for the 5th series of rars, so I guess I have to give up on these for now...

any super genius want to let me in on how they made dvd 2 3 and 4 work?

suprbay is very nice, but I didnt see the solution mentioned here up there, would love to know how dumb I am, plz let me know where I strayed from the path........."
,ProperX,2007-08-19T14:08Z,"duphrane, did you try upgrading you winrar version?"
,BearCat,2007-08-19T15:06Z,Will the BonusDisc be posted ?
,Dentrosch,2007-08-19T15:53Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3778206

When you have trouble unraring the PHOTOSHOP.TOP.SECRET.DVD.X-HELL\h-pstsX.r01 files 
Just copy the bat file into folder where the .r01 files are and double click.
Then unrar and enjoy."
,softsofty,2007-08-19T16:21Z,"Like Kalima9 said, just start from the h-psts4.rar file..."
,duhprane,2007-08-19T21:17Z,"New winrar seems to have the same results....

thanks for the kind info, got the fix bat, looks like what I did manually, gonna re-download the files again and see how it goes.

Thanks for the helping hands"
,duhprane,2007-08-22T02:16Z,"Well fuck me, It works great....

Thanks all who helps tards....

,Tangenbordet,2007-08-28T23:01Z,Tack fรถr alla delar i denna serie!!
,Bongster,2007-09-03T07:39Z,Can some one please explain how to open this up. I have 1-3 but the fourth I cant get to extract the files. Noob. I cant find the place in the forums where they give the fix was wondering if it was different. I have opened 2 + 3 with the fix listed in a torrent elswhere but it doesnt work on the 4th cd for me. Thanks.
,wirthith,2007-09-12T20:35Z,"i need some help here, i cant do anything with the extracted ISOfile! if i burn, nothing on the tv, if i mount, i can chose to play up a photoplay! isnt this a video file? and i cant play the isofile in mediaplayer or vlc... anyone the same problem"
,alvindim,2007-10-13T03:22Z,this is not the kind of video that you can play on a regular DVD player connected to your TV. This is a DVD ROM Video. Mount the Image ISO file using Daemon Tools. It will open the folders and file of the ISO Image  and find the HTML file that says START HERE. It will bring you to the Tutorial Screen.
,jahkarma,2007-12-13T22:01Z,thanks this works like a charm
,tomatosupe,2008-01-20T06:51Z,"it seems the projects files are not properly arranged  according to the dvds. e.g. dvd 2 has vector art, stylized character. can someone pls tell me those who have this, what project files are located on this dvd?"
,brndn,2008-03-13T22:32Z,"Hey, new to the whole ISO mounting thing...
Do i need to have DVD-Rs for this to work?
Also, is every file on in the torrent a separate disk?"
,Addicted2,2008-03-15T14:20Z,Thanks... works great
