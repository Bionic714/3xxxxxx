my name is Irene and I saw your comment on a ""King's Quest 7 iso"" file thing here at thepiratebay. I was wondering if you could help me out? I'm new to this. I downloaded the game, but how do I start it? In which program can I open it? etc. I just have no idea what to do.
Add my msn; fairyrock.x@hotmail.com and talk to me there.
