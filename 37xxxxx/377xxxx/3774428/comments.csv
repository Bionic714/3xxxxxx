,tomtomx,2007-08-16T11:57Z,"""This is a strange little book about the Arab-Israeli conflict from a major public figure. It is premised on the notion that Americans too often get only one side of the story, one uncritically sympathetic to Israel, so someone with authority and knowledge needs to offer a fuller picture. Fine idea. The problem is that in this book Jimmy Carter does not do so. Instead, he simply offers a narrative that is largely unsympathetic to Israel. Israeli bad faith fills the pages. Hollow statements by Israel's enemies are presented without comment. Broader regional developments go largely unexamined. In other words, whether or not Carter is right that most Americans have a distorted view of the conflict, his contribution is to offer a distortion of his own.""

,bigfhead,2008-02-25T04:30Z,"I'm not palestinian or israeli or muslim or jewish or christian. I'm plain old agnostic american. But I'd have to be completely blind or sympathetic to israel to not admit to the hell that is the life of a palestinian. Unfortunately, most Americans are as ignorant as Sargent_D and claim to understand when they really don't have a clue. Palestinians aren't terrorists. They are only defending their land that was given to Zionists by the British. To say that they ""made their bed, let em lie in it"" doesn't even make any sense. That comment makes me believe that somehow people believe the so called ""terrorists"" defending palestine are the same people that blew up the world trade center... this is not the case. Although, the United States' constant defense and financial support of israel IS sure to cause further hatred of the US and apartheid between us and the eastern countries."
,Banned4Life,2008-10-05T00:01Z,"Carter did more for Israel than all of your rabbis put together. What he did at Camp David was a biblical achievement. And he is pointing out the human rights issue. Why is that anyone disagreeing with Israeli govt is anti-semite? Mind you, he won Nobel prize with Begin and Sadat."
,tomtomx,2008-12-27T02:22Z,"Bishop Tutu and ?Israeli Apartheid?

Late last month, I went to hear Bishop Desmond Tutu speak at Boston?s Old South Church at a conference on ?Israel Apartheid.?

Tutu is a well respected man of G-d. He brought reconciliation between blacks and whites in South Africa. That he would lead a conference that damns the Jewish State is very disturbing to me.

The State of Israel is not an apartheid state. I know because I write this from Jerusalem where I have seen Arab mothers peacefully strolling with their families ? even though I also drove on Israeli roads protected by walls and fences from Arab bullets and stones. I know Arabs go to Israeli schools, and get the best medical care in the world. I know they vote and have elected representatives to the Israeli Parliament. I see street signs in Arabic, an official language here.

None of this was true for blacks under Apartheid in Tutu?s South Africa. I also know countries that do deserve the apartheid label: My country, Sudan, is on the top of the list, but so are Iran, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. What has happened to my people in Sudan is a thousand times worse than Apartheid in South Africa. And no matter how the Palestinians suffer, they suffer nothing compared to my people. Nothing. And most of the suffering is the fault of their leaders.

Bishop Tutu, I see black Jews walking down the street here in Jerusalem. Black like us, free and proud.

Tutu said Israeli checkpoints are a nightmare. But checkpoints are there because Palestinians are sent into Israel to blow up and kill innocent women and children.

Tutu wants checkpoints removed. Do you not have doors in your home, Bishop? Does that make your house an apartheid house? If someone, Heaven forbid, tried to enter with a bomb, we would want you to have security people ?humiliating? your guests with searches, and we would not call you racist for doing so. We all go through checkpoints at every airport. Are the airlines being racist? No.

Yes, the Palestinians are inconvenienced at checkpoints. But why, Bishop Tutu, do you care more about that inconvenience than about Jewish lives?

Bishop, when you used to dance for Mandela?s freedom, we Africans ? all over Africa ? joined in. Our support was key in your freedom. But when children in Burundi and Kinshasa, all the way to Liberia and Sierra Leone, and in particular in Sudan, cried and called for rescue, you heard but chose to be silent.

Today, black children are enslaved in Sudan, the last place in the continent of Africa where humans are owned by other humans ? I was part of the movement to stop slavery in Mauritania, which just now abolished the practice. But you were not with us, Bishop Tutu.

So where is Desmond Tutu when my people call out for freedom? Slaughter and genocide and slavery are lashing Africans right now. Where are you for Sudan, Bishop Tutu? You are busy attacking the Jewish State.

Why?

Simon Deng is a refugee from Southern Sudan, now an American citizen."

,nirvana232,2012-03-06T21:25Z,"I can only laugh at tomtomx and I_QBot. The NYtimes presents well-reasoned synopsis'? Please. They are a Jewish Zionist newspaper. 

Just as I've noticed them and the Washington Post do to all anti-Zionist works, they build them up and then knock them down to give the impression it's not worth any attention. 

I can almost assure you this 'review' is more critical than the book than the book is of Israel. The book may not appear balanced at first view, but that's because this whole conflict, is not balanced. There is no justification for the treatment of Palestinians. Many Rabbis agree with this sentiment.

tomtomx, you are delusional. Israel is by definition an apartheid state. It is much worse than what South Africa was. The Israelis just don't like the word 'apartheid', but that doesn't change the truth of what it is."
,nirvana232,2012-03-06T21:26Z,more critical of the book than the book is of Israel*
