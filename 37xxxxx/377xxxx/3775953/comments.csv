,jeromedevine,2007-09-04T03:13Z,"Oh NO!!! It doesn't work on Windows 98?! Let us all convert to OSX or Linux then. Come on, Let's right now, this very instant. Come on people don't be ridiculous. Use Windows XP and nothing else. Windows XP just works and lets you do whatever you want. All the others being OSX, Vista, Linux, whatever simply are not up to standard. XP Forever! MUhaa haha haha haha!"

,appatight,2007-11-07T19:24Z,"ok everyone this does work.  for those of you who receives the demo version that comes up...the problem is this reg edit was derived from a full registered version which expired around september 2005 or 2006.  since it is a reg edit this key checks for the current date of the system.  If it is beyond the expiration date then a script within fruity loop forces it to come up as a demo and send you to a site to obtain your new updated registration.  well the way that you can trick it is since it reads the date of the system, set the date back on your system before the date of expiration and apply the settings...vahla your version in now full again.  I'm current working on a new reg key for the updated date so you won't have to set back the date everytime.  I think the expiration of this crack is september 2006...so set the date back before then.  if it still doesn't work just keep setting the date back a year and reopen fruity until it comes up as a full version.

OS X is a fantastic operating system, Linux has everything Windows has (I play Halflife 2 on my Linux distro) using wine, and it's a hell of a lot more stable. Unless you really can't live without DirectX 10, you shouldn't be using Windows, especially since it's one of the hardest systems to successfully defend against malware etc."
