Josh Kamler & Axel Albin Albin and Kamler create some of the freshest material found on the Internet. This letter to bosses says what we can?t all say: we leave our jobs because you, dear boss, have not lived up to our standards, so how about a little effort from your end and we?ll give a little more from ours. This is a great cathartic read, with some colorfully emotive language, that just may get you thinking about how you can make a change in your workplace to promote creativity whether you are boss or employee.

-LEGAL TORRENTS

Purpose:

create a balance, share the already free stuff,
public domain works, freeware, free music,
free ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.

show the copyright owners that torrent
websites shouldn't bear the responsibility
of what their users upload, torrent websites
are very much similar to google..

users upload what they want to upload,
download what they want to download,
and search for what they want to search..

by creating this balance and sharing the already free
stuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..
