,british.gaijin,2007-09-15T22:09Z,"I'll be sure to let you know what I think when it finishes. I love the Doom games and constantly question why they never *officially* ported it to PSP. 
What I don't really hesitate to say is that all official Doom ports are bad. OK, I do apologise somewhat for the PSX and Xbox Doom 3's versions of Doom. But just look at the 360 version, it can barely stand up on it's own two legs!
Anyway, I enjoyed playing Doom 2 on the PSP Doom port before, so it will be nice to have all these WADs avaliable also. Thank you very much ~_^"
