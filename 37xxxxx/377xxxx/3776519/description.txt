Release Notes:

Robyn is the pint-sized atom bomb dosed on electric
and dispensing wisdom in three-minute modernist pop
bulletins on the post-adolescent condition. Her
newest album, 'Robyn' is a collection of
ultra-concise pop moments  that rarest of things, a
classic pop album. It's a sad-eyed, super-strong
battery of nuclear-powered pop and it's the best
weapon she's got.

The UK release of 'Robyn' also features re-recorded,
jumped up versions of 'Bum Like You' and 'Robotboy'.
The boisterous Cobrastyle (which was previously
released on last years 'Rakamonie EP') and the heart
achingly beautiful 'With Every Heartbeat' has also
been added.
