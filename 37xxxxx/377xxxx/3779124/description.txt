There are analyzers for signal and modulation analysis such as a high resolution FFT, modulation speed, signal phase analyzers as well as bit domain analyzers. In addition there are several generic (universal) decoders (FSK, MFSK, MPSK, MSK, PAM and PSK) which are used to decode known/unknown transmissions.
