,dstructor,2008-04-08T09:54Z,"ATTENTION !!!

If you want to get over the Mission 4 ""Think Like A Gun"" crash...

Go to www.gamecopyworld.com, Search ""Kill.Switch"" and download the save game with all the missions

Then, choose load it, open mission select & choose the one after ""Middle East"""

,FireZen,2008-08-26T15:58Z,"Got issue, getting stuck everytime there is supposed to be a cut-scene. Tried the mission selecter from gameburn, it works sometimes but there are many levels i can't play. This release is shit if you ask me, not seeding this crap."
,Crazedkid,2008-10-27T12:34Z,"Hopefully this game will fucking rock,oh and work or not ill seed unlike alot of  these leaching bastards^_^"
,pietastesgood,2009-02-21T20:30Z,"I'm having a problem. It's not just with your version toed, it's with the whole game. My system specs are above the minimum but i still have issues. When I launch the game the screen starts flickering and when the game starts it ends up having 4 mini-Kill switches on my monitor. my monitor's at 800x600. i played at 640x400, 800x600, and 1024x768 and still no luck. Any ideas?"
