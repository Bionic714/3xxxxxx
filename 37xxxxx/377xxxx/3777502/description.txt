Special Info Note:

Some virus-scanner recognize the header of packed exe's (switchkill.exe)

as a lame virus, (coz it's the mostly byte by byte check error of 'em!.)

This is truly a false information!,  a so called false positive, you can read 

more about in your VirusTool-Manual or WebSite!.
