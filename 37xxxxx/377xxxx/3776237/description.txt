This release has been made mostly for Russian Internet community in general and for our friends at DisneyJazz.net in particular. However, since my rips also features original English audio tracks, and video quality surpasses most rips on the Internet, i decided to release it worldwide. Be sure to know how to switch audio streams, else this release won't do you any good ;). To see subtitles correctly, set DirectVodSub (or similar filter) to plaintext mode, because position info from subtitles track is wrong. This is well-known bug of my ttxt-ripping implementation, but i don't have time to fix it or fix resulting subtitles.
