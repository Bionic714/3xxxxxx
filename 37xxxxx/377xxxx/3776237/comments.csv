,Anticia,2007-09-15T23:17Z,"Hi there! ^^
I'm pretty glad you uplaoded this season since I couldn""'t find it anywhere! :D

But I have a little problem...It doesn't work...I guess it's the codec... I already have ACE megapack...Do you think I can solve with it or I have to delete it and get K-lite to make it work...?

Thank you very much! :)"
,LRN,2007-09-16T18:39Z,"You need:
MediaPlayer Classic (it has a few embedded filters, namely - MP4 splitter)
DirectVobSub
ffdshow or CoreAVC (for H.264 decoding)
ffdshow or Core (for AAC decoding)
You could download MPC anywhere (just google for it)
MPC - http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=82303&package_id=84358
DirectVobSub - http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=82303&package_id=84359
ffdshow - http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=173941
If you want CoreAAC or CoreAVC, just google for them.

Or you could really just uninstall ACE megapack and install K-lite Mega Pack."
,LRN,2007-11-02T00:03Z,I am looking for someone to seed this torrent permanently instead of me. If you're up to that - post a comment here. I am planning to stop seeding in a week or two.
,SlayersBoxer,2007-12-28T15:43Z,"Hi! Thanks for the torrent. But which of the dowloads should I choose from media player classic - zip file(s) or the ""other"" file(s)??
Please reply...
Thanks"

,Nikeela,2008-03-17T20:38Z,"episodes 2, 11 and 22 are not working (can't play them or even change the name of the file) because the names are TOO LONG or that is what my PC is telling me... if someone has those three episodes that work and have smaller names then please add them somewhere where they can be found, please."
,LRN,2008-03-20T18:12Z,"You could try alternative file manager (not the windows explorer). Sorry, if long names are uncomfortable to you.
P.S. You could try to rename files during download via your bittorrent client, AFAIK Azureus could do that."
,monicapews91,2008-12-12T23:20Z,"seed please, i will reseed it after i finish d/load"
,xenoFLASH,2011-10-06T01:08Z,Why are the names so long? Is it really necessary?
,LRN,2011-11-26T19:57Z,"About long filenames: it's a habit i've developed from my ed2k days, when filename was the only thing you could search for, so people tended to put as much info into it as possible.
Also applies to DirectConnect, which i've used a lot at some point (and shared these files there as well).
But you've got a point - it has to stop somewhere, so if i ever do more releases, i'll keep that in mind."
