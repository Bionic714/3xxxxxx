,Neighbor,2010-01-08T02:44Z,"Although this movie does have multiple audio tracks, constantly switching from channel 1-3 for each audio clip is annoying... does anyone have a suggestion on how to set VLC player to default audio track 3 (english) for those clips only? Not sure it is possible for those clips only but that is why I'm asking. Also the 4th clip (I think, can't remember) needs audio track 2 to play in english. Thanks in advance for any suggestions."
