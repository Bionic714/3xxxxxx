,Lucian_,2009-02-03T03:19Z,"Doesn't work for me (""Unknown Error""), I'm guessing it's a vista thing."
,schlafrig,2009-07-24T10:17Z,"Hey thanks for uploading this buddy.
This game is actually really hard to come by these days, as it's developer 'Nival' dropped it a while back."
,Saneth,2010-02-08T02:14Z,I've got the 'Unknown Error' as well on vista. Does anyone know a solution for that ?
,Bialgesuard,2011-01-12T15:53Z,"About the 'unknown error' people get: there is a problem with the Silent Storm engine and newer gfx cards. You can fix it by limiting the amount of RAM your system has to 3GB or lower (I put in 2GB to be safe).

Easiest way to do this is go to Start Menu>Run and type in msconfig, then enter. Then go to Boot>Advanced options then check the 'Maximum Memory' box and type 3072 (again I use 2048 to be on the safe side) and press ok. The system will then ask you to restart, do so.

Bear in mind that it will limit the amount of RAM your system has until you undo the change (i.e. uncheck the 'Maximum Memory' box in msconfig and reboot again.

Hope this helps and thanks for the torrent."

Help!"
,valedor_one,2011-11-26T11:43Z,"The game works BUT it crashes to desktop if I change graphics quality or if I change resolution.
Does anyone know a fix for this or where the settings file is located?"
