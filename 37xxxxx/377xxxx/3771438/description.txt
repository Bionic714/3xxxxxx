What the heck, here's Hellzapoppin'!  

"A compendium of chaos; a potpourri of pottiness; a veritable vestibule of...well anyway, you get the picture. It's a comedy classic in which Johnson and Olsen preside over the gags, wisecracks and mayhem. A projectionist (Howard) tries to run a film while arguing with his girlfriend, only to have the stars step out and remonstrate with him; a woman with a pot plant wanders in and out of scenes and there is some very odd business with a private eye. It's been called Pythonesque, and perhaps that's the closest you'll get to an apt enough description. Inspired lunacy." - Channel 4/FilmFour
