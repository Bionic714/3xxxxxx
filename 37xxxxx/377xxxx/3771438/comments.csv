,ultrascichick,2008-06-03T23:01Z,Audio/Video sync is off. Can anyone fix and repost? Let us know. Thanks!
,OrpheusDude,2009-07-10T06:34Z,"The audio is definitely out of synch with the video throughout this entire download - just by a second or less, but enough to make it annoying.  There appears to be a corrected version available on The Pirate Bay and is labeled as such.  I haven't had a chance to download it yet, but I suggest that you look for that version and skip this one.  And if the alternate version is, indeed, correctly synchronized, this download should be removed."
,OrpheusDude,2009-07-11T12:59Z,"OK: I have now downloaded and tested the corrected version, and the audio and video are in perfect sync.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE MOVIE FROM THIS PAGE!  You need to get it from

Clownmonkey: You need to DELETE your version in which the audio and video are out of sync."
