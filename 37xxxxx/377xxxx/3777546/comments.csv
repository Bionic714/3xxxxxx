It may say pro but try and export high res images or video , what a surprise you cant.
Don't waste your time you might as well download the free version from Google, it would be a great deal quicker."
,rowborough,2007-08-20T22:07Z,"And another thing rafaelss ive looked at you uploads, youve just ripped off other peoples (crap) stuff and reposted, why ? does it get you all hard to think you have posted on the Bay?.

But yor probably about 7 like most arsholes posting pointless torrents, get a life prick."

,TRMC,2007-08-23T22:44Z,"rowborough: have you ever tried a GOOD cracked Pro version and do you know how GE works ??? I doubt it...

I use a Pro 4.1 version (not the one in this torrent wich is an ""old"" 4.0) and ALL is functionnal including high def image printing and saving and video export...

BTW, I do agree with you : repacking stuff that someone else uploaded is bad ;)"
,TRMC,2007-08-25T01:41Z,"BTW, the 4.1 Pro version I have is this one :
""Google.Earth.Pro.v4.1.7087.WinAll.Incl.Patch-DEC0DE - vLcB""

And I checked all Pro functions and they are OK :D

So sometimes ""monkeys"" are more clever than some wich call themselves ""humans"" :P

I'll upload the version I have if someone ask :D"
