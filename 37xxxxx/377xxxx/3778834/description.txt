Featuring a variety of instruments (Highland pipes, fiddles, guitars, tin whistles, bouzouki, bodhran, mandolin, Shuttle pipes) and brilliant vocal harmonies, Celtic Offspring produced some of the best traditional music to come out of southwestern Ontario, Canada from 1993-2003.

Having been compared to Scotland's Tannahill Weavers and the Battlefield Band, Celtic Offspring's show featured powerful, original songs and instrumentals, in addition to traditional, Celtic based tunes. Featuring the song writing talents of Ed Nicol and the quartet's dynamic arrangements, each show is punctuated by their traditional, acoustic, energetic trademark!
