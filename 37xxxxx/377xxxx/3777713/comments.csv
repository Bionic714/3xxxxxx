,ressasaur,2008-01-24T20:55Z,"Hey Tamp, Any chance of getting a quick reseed on this classic? At least 8 leechers are stuck at 89.5%. Once I get it, I'll reseed to 200% plus. And thanks for the up on this!"
,tamp,2008-02-01T22:40Z,I will seed this again for a few days.
,ressasaur,2008-02-12T00:25Z,"Thanks Tamp!
For re-seeding this. And I kept my word. I have re-upped this 500% already but unfortunately people keep insisting on H&Ring on this great Up of yours. So I'll seed another 5-10Gbs and then that's it for me. If these leechers want to ruin it for the next guy, that is really too bad.
Thank again, Tamp, for all your efforts on this great movie. I for one really appreciate it."

,Ma From Oz,2008-12-12T08:56Z,"Hi TAMP, I seem to have arrived at this torrent a little late. I?m the only one left and I?m missing 88mb of the main title. I would much appreciate it if you or someone else could upload the missing pieces. 
I think you are doing a great service especially to us in the southern hemisphere where less known titles such as this are not available. Thank you."
,tamp,2008-12-12T18:07Z,Hello Ma From Oz. I will seed so you can get 100% right now. Have a great weekend!
,Ma From Oz,2008-12-12T21:07Z,"Big thanks TAMP, I'm at 100%. It looks like it will be a good weekend even though it?s pouring outside and we expect rain for the next couple of days. A good opportunity, to catch-up on some old movies. Thanks again.
This torrent seems to have and endless life. Yesterday I was the only one on, and now I see six people. I only have the main feature but I'll keep uploading for a few days. "

,Nash-LR,2010-06-26T23:26Z,"So, a bunch of us are on 99+ percent and the only seeder left is giving us all of 2 kb/s, so this is taking forever. Why is that? Why do people do that? This is why I hate torrents and switched to Usenet years ago. The one exception a year that I can't find what I'm after on Usenet and have to come look here, I remember why I made the switch. If I get to finish this torrent, I will seed it 2x at maximum speeds. If by that time I'm the only one left of the present bunch (which I'm likely to be, another reason I hate torrents: all seem to hit and run nowadays), tough! "
,mrcyber,2011-05-16T21:54Z,Many Many Thanks tamp for uploading been looking for this movie will be seeding fo a long time
