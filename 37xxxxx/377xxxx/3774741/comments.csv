,HP77,2007-09-12T02:51Z,"For those who remember playing Pirates! GOLD, This is great! And (so far) it was easy to make it work! You unrar both files in the same directory.  Use KEYGen, write down the KEYGen-code, and type it when asked (After running Setup- file).  Run Setup-file (from the directory you have Unrared it to.), and install it! Runs without CD-ROM! "
