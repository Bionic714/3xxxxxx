,Zombietits,2008-04-20T21:21Z,"Yes this torrent works.
when you download the .rar file, extract it with winzip. start the no$gba program load the .nds file. its that easy kids.

Problems:
game freezes at the end of battles,
at first I had the emulator settings on 
Emu. speed: unlimited MHz Disaster 100%
sound output: none
when the game froze I switched the sound to Digital Stereo and it unfroze.

-you might also want to look in to updating the Emulator at http://nocash.emubase.de/gba.htm (and donate to them so they can keep updating it!) updating always helps problems-

Saving:
the BATTERY file contains saved games, you can only have one at a time in this pokemon game so you will have to erase the current one to save your own. and save your game just like you would on a gameboy.
I can not get my saved game to load as of right now but I will keep working on it.
hope this helped kids. "
