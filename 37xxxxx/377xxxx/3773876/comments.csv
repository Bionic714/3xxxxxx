The uploader has today also presented a 1.3 Giga version of Paul Walker's http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0397313/
but this could also be the older Japanese version
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085991/
Who wants to download 7 Gigas to find out?"
[V],Kuthumi,2007-08-15T19:36Z,"If it is the older Japanese film from 1983, you should read the user comments on imdb. Example: 
I accidently stumbled upon this movie and was immediately ensconced in its story line, scenery and cast of characters (primarily the dogs). The subtitles did not distract from the films Japanese dialogue. This semi-documentary style added authenticity to the fact based plot. The human actors may have been the catalyst for this poignant retelling, but the dogs were indeed the glue that held this film together. Given the fact that most of the sets were filmed on location, the dogs performed exceptionally well and held this viewer fast.

The misadventures that the dogs endured during their separation from their owners were deeply touching and powerful. One would have to have ice water flowing through one's veins to be unmoved from this film. Although hard to find, I heartily recommend the movie for age groups of 12 or older. The violence is implied rather than portrayed but none-the-less quite intense. "

[V],Kuthumi,2007-08-17T16:05Z,"The ""Downloaded 16 times"" was there already when the torrent was posted, I think it happens when someone transfer it from another site."
