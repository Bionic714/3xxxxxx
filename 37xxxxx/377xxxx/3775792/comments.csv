,LawrenceX,2007-12-30T06:44Z,Come on! This kid was just asking a question and you guys just have to answer it nicely. That simple.
,Bigsister,2008-01-05T03:55Z,"I thank anyone who makes torrents to help others. I appreciate this package very much. I wish I had the knowledge to make and share things like this. But I am still learning.

I do feel that name calling and otherwise childish behavior is uncalled for. On both parts :(

As for someone asking what an ICON is... I usually go to google, wiki, or a online dictionary to ask questions like that. 

Everyone is not a computer engineer there are newbies coming online every day. I was a newbie once and folks can be very cruel online for no good reason.

When you are using a computer you are using icons  all the time.
Check out the link below for information:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon_(computing)"
,mcmurray,2008-02-05T22:27Z,Thank You for your work and your upload. Much appreciated.
,JimmyTheGent,2008-02-07T14:02Z,"Thanks sbm, I will be sure to seed"
,MogensOG,2008-03-21T01:01Z,"djtdon.... i've reached to this conclusion: You just got OWNED ( just wanted to mention it :P) 

Nice torrent btw"
,keyguy13,2008-04-25T17:15Z,"Look, there are silly questions and then there are ridiculously retarded questions.

You can pretty much assume that the more harsh the answer, the more stupid the question. 

Yes, we were all newbies once, and we all went through our initiation of being called fucking morons every time we asked a stupid question. Get over it. If you have such thin skin, computers and forums and online chat is not for you...

Move on..."
,morpheus63,2008-10-07T13:16Z,This might sound stupid but how do you UNRAR this? when ever I download something like this I fuck it up.
,ololizoz,2008-11-26T08:01Z,seed plz!
,ololizoz,2008-11-26T14:34Z,how do i apply them?
,xcrimsonprophecyx,2008-12-07T01:27Z,Get winrar downloaded and then double click the winrar file icon to unpack it. Go through the process and chose a destination for the files to be stored on the hard drice and hten open them up and use them. =]
