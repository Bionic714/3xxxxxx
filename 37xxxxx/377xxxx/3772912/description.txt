Photorecording serves as not only a live studio album recorded directly after their last performance, but also as a never before seen DVD documentary of their last tour. The 2 disc set compiles the aforementioned recording and documentary as well as bonus footage of live shows during the last two years of ELLIOTT's existence. Anyone who is familiar with the band will tell you that the live show is the true beauty behind ELLIOTT, garnering them a spot amongst the most revered live acts of this generation. The shows not only complemented their prolific recordings, but also enriched the experience for even the most casual fans of ELLIOTT to miss their live show would be considered a crime.
