,TallusX,2008-01-28T17:04Z,Is ther any payment for playing the game or can we play it for free if we have the key? 
,Tilran,2008-02-08T03:38Z,"I doubt this is even real.  The actual client is 8gigs, and this is 4.22
"
,CompleteGibberish,2008-05-06T15:13Z,"The game, packed, is 12 gigs....not 4 gigs :p I find it funny that the ULers name is Warsuxx...Warhammer onlines full name is
Warhammer Age or Reckoning---WAR--Warsuxx

Just do the math and avoid the torrent"
