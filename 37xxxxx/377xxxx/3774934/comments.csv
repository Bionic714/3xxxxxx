Still, the selections are fairly good, since it is meant to be a cursory glance at these masterpieces, and he does explain the key elements, parts, and concepts of these select works. It's still best to read a book after this, but as a first step, it is okay."

Very true, but keep in mind that ALL of the TTC courses are really nothing more than 101 courses. Fine introductions, no more - but they don't pretend to be anything else. Consider for a moment just how complex TRULY in-depth history really is. One of my profs in college began with a BA in History, an MA in medieval studies and the german language, and finally wrote her disseratation for her PHD on the communiques between two Bavarian trading cities during the 30 years war. The TTC is a great way to get started."
