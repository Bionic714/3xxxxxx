,Espionage724,2007-08-17T11:51Z,Serious? Last time i played this game it was a demo. The crack didn't do anything to my computer. I never tried playing this version without the crack though so idk.
,Espionage724,2007-08-17T11:55Z,Also i played this game in maybe 2002 so its been a long time.
,Enthol,2007-08-18T13:53Z,"I doubt Crimsonland is freeware, last time I played it. Around 2005 you could get the demo for free and then pay for premium (more weapons and perks etc) The crack is probably to get the full version.

I have not tested this release though. Witch game version is it?"
,Espionage724,2007-08-19T01:18Z,1.98 or something like that
,Espionage724,2007-09-02T02:23Z,Yes You Need To Apply The Crack. I Tried Playing Without Crack And It Told Me I Had To Purchase The Full Version.
,cire14000,2007-09-06T22:06Z,it won't work for me whenever i try to run it (and this is after i applied the crack) it says that a fatal error has occur with reflexive arcade. could it have something to do with my applying the crack after it is installed?
,Espionage724,2007-09-10T23:33Z,"Hmm...what I did was:

1. Install Game
2. Do Not Start Game
3. Put The Crack In 
C:\Program Files\Crimsonland
C:\Program Files x86\Crimsonland (For Vista 64)
4. Run The Crack And Find Grim.dll
5. If It Says Successful Then It Should Work.
6. If It Didn't, Uninstall Game
7. Redownload This Torrent Also And Repeat 1-5

Tested On 
Windows XP Home SP2 32-Bit
Windows Vista Ultimate 32-Bit"

,ClaymanAlex,2008-07-06T18:56Z,it worked perfect! i did precisly what Mr. Espionage724  said!
,Necro-File,2008-08-28T05:31Z,Forgetit: You're an idiot. Please shut up. Crimsonland is not a free game. There is a time and feature limited DEMO that is free; the crack for this removes the time-limit and restricts the full-version's features.
,Necro-File,2008-08-28T05:31Z,correction: UNrestricts.
,sarge112,2008-09-16T20:51Z,"I downloaded this in under a minute. Whoever is seeding this, thanks!"
,tomduhbomb4,2008-09-26T03:37Z,great torrent espionage works great
,Espionage724,2009-01-04T08:31Z,There is an updated version of Crimsonland floating around on it's main website somewhere. This crack does not work with it.
,sexy_bitch7412,2009-08-13T18:18Z,which version is this?
,smdvostok,2010-11-27T00:35Z,^ Maybe you should look at the comments? It's 1.9.8 if you use the patcher
