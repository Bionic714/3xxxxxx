,WonderSlug,2008-03-04T09:49Z,"The MathID that pops up in the KeyGen is different than the one that Mathematica 6.0 comes up with, hence Mathematica says that the KeyGen's password is invalid.

How do I fix this?"
,kodenho,2008-03-22T12:28Z,"thanks, downloading and seeding! :D"
[T],rage!,2008-09-11T02:07Z,"Alright since am here Ill help some people here. BTW I didnt download is one due to its lack of seeders. 

First off, nearly every Keygen will come up as a Virus or Trojan. This was uploaded last year so am betting this is clean.

To get this to work you need to:
-Put in a BS name. (forget about the Organization Name, you dotn need it.
-Copy/paste the number in the lower left of the keygen. This is the license number.
-The MathID isnt the one you need. Delete the MathID given in the Keygen. Copy/paste the one from the mathematica prompt.
-Click Generate
-Copy/paste the new password to mathematica prompt.

Click OK"
,spykoni,2008-11-09T19:49Z,"Hello. I have a problem with installation. I
run the setup.exe but it does not open me the window to register. When I open the mathematica file, there appears the following pop up.
""MathLink linkname missing or malformed""
If anyone can help, please do."
