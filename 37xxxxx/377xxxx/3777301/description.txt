 Rapaille reveals the unconscious motivators behind how we act and what we buy by unearthing the unique culture codes found within each of us.

Dr. Clotaire Rapaille is the chairman of Archetype Discoveries Worldwide. He is the personal adviser to ten high-ranking CEOs and is kept on retainer by fifty Fortune 100 companies. Dr. Rapaille√¢??s unique approach to marketing combines a psychiatrist's depth of analysis with a businessman's attention to practical concerns. His technique for market research has grown out of his work in the areas of psychiatry, psychology, and cultural anthropology. Dr. Rapaille's psychiatric work and research with autistic children led him to develop a new process for understanding how children are imprinted for the first time. He has been profiled in many national media outlets, including 60 Minutes II and on the front page of the New York Times Sunday Styles section.

-LEGAL TORRENTS

Purpose:

create a balance, share the already free stuff,
public domain works, freeware, free music,
free ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.

show the copyright owners that torrent
websites shouldn't bear the responsibility
of what their users upload, torrent websites
are very much similar to google..

users upload what they want to upload,
download what they want to download,
and search for what they want to search..

by creating this balance and sharing the already free
stuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..
