,Beeeye,2007-08-21T01:12Z,I don't seem to have any virtual cockpit after install.... did I miss something or are other people experiencing this?
,skyhawkau,2007-08-21T02:13Z,"TO see VC you need to enable it by pressing the silver button near the EFIS screens on the main panel, theres a photo on CLS forum if you need it,

The sound for me doesn't work well, inside cockpit is okay but there is very little sound exterior view."

,Whalebone,2007-08-23T05:12Z,"VC still appears broken after turning it on as stated above. The auto-pilot area is blacked out.

Also was not able to get rid of the crazy high pitch engine screeching sound after takeoff? attempted twice."
,Whalebone,2007-08-23T05:16Z,...and not to bitch as this is prolly a CLS mistake but package is to model A330-200/300 and A340-200/300 but I noticed on the FMC when trying the A340-200 that the FMC said aircraft type was CLS-A340-600 ??
,Beeeye,2007-08-24T00:05Z,My VC works after pressing the button in the 2d panel now. I'll have a look for that FMC problem...

My first REQUEST on TPB: any Boeing CHINHOOK, the old Vietnam Heavy Lifter, i really want one badly! for FSX, but FS9 is still ok."
,dnoncent,2007-12-11T16:22Z,How do you install this add-on? There's no installation file. Only an uninstall exe file.
,Husky42,2007-12-27T11:12Z,"BE AWARE:

What 4X-AXG does is like Fairlight stealing something from Razor or Deviance.

This would not happen within groups, it is about competition. All 4X-AXG has managed to do was alienate himself as a non team player and thief.

This would not have been accepted years ago. A child to the game 4X-AXG will continue to steal. But be aware, he has never released a file that was not released elsewhere first.

He has never purchased and sold, or donated to help a cause. He is the lowest of the lowest when it comes to file sharers and in no way deserves any form of respect. He does not even know how to give appropriate credit.

4X-AXG you are nothing more then a pathetic fucking thief."
