This is cool stuff. First official kiss concert without make-up. It took place in Lisbon Portugal in October 1983. The promotors must've been stupid cause they put out posters with kiss IN make-up so when the show was on the fans was shocked. They were like; Who the hell are these guys?

Gene and Paul said in an interwiev they were very nervous and when the announcer yelled the classic YOU WANTED THE BEST... and the bombs went off, they didn't know how to behave. It was very awkward for them at first. But soon they got into it.

Unfortunately only two songs are recorded. Well, atleast that's what we get on Kissology vol.2.

It's the opening songs Creatures of the Night and Detroit Rock City.

Also, I must say it's great to see Vinnie Vincent live without make-up. I had never done that before.

Enjoy!
