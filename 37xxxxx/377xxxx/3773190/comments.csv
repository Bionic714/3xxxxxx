,mndgme,2007-08-17T18:44Z,"Great collection. I have all the volumes that you have out. And i must say...that they are wonderful. Lots of stuff you normally dont hear. Vol. 7 seems more on the R&B side though. But don't get me wrong, its great. Thanks for sharing. Keep it up! "
,lespen,2007-08-22T16:36Z,"Great collection, I've been listening a lot to it! 
This is not a complain, more like a question: Can you add more hip-hop songs in Black Party Traxxx vol. 8? More ""gangster"" songs if you know what I mean, instead of more calm songs like vol. 7 seems to have more of.
Anyway, no matter what songs you chose, I'm sure that vol 8 will be GREAT, just like the other 7 albums!"
