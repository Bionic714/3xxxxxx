,crying_WOS_member,2007-08-17T06:52Z,"WOS Rules!!!!
Go to:
http://fs2004.info/forum/
(thats where we share stolen software and make people pay money to have access to the files. We don't bother renewing links for the JEWS on the public section that don't pay us money.)
Thats the way us WOS members roll.

But you better not share it anywhere else because that would mean that people wouldn't pay money for a VIP section to get these files that we stole.

Hey N537JB, our SS uniforms came in the mail today.
Check it out brother:
