,jeffersonpark,2007-10-09T09:05Z,Love to have this if someone can re-seed.. PLease!
,jeffersonpark,2007-10-10T04:37Z,FYI - The bitrates are all over the place on these..
,blots,2007-12-21T05:57Z,"This torrent is horrible. The bit rate varies all over the place in half the albums, some bit rates are below 50. A couple of albums are here twice, or have a few bonus versions of certain tracks (none of which add up to a cohesive bitrate). One album is in WMA. I don't mean to be picky...though."
,Crabstix,2008-08-02T18:41Z,Seriously... rar? For why? I only want a couple of the albums.
