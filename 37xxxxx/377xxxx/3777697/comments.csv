BIG Thanks"
,eb#1,2007-08-19T20:44Z,Great! Many thanks! :-)
[T],wormman,2007-08-20T22:44Z,"Thanks for a very nice upload ""kef71"" I hope that you have time for the rest of the seasons."
[T],kef71,2007-08-21T08:00Z,"worman: I will seed them all on a weekly basis. 

Side-note: My upload ratio is now 88%, but the availability is 98%. Something fishy is  going on. How the hell can there be a bigger availability than I have uploaded???"
,eb#1,2007-08-21T08:27Z,"Sounds like a bug, I have 99% now so that's what you must have uploaded."
[T],kef71,2007-08-21T08:42Z,"I don't think it is a bug, I remember someone having 52% availability when everyone else was around 7-9%. I think someone tried to help seed. So far I've uploaded 37.1 GB out of 41.2, that 90% and exactly what my client reports to me now..."
[T],kef71,2007-08-26T11:04Z,benny_hill: Great thanks! I'll use DVD decrypter next time. I see you're helping with TNG as well. I really really apprichiate it.

[T],kef71,2007-10-12T08:35Z,"Rekot: There where only 16 episodes in the first season so Paramount ""filled"" disc 6 with episodes from TOS."

godaremat say: ""A little curious, how come disc 5 is smaller then the rest? This one fits on a regular DVD while the others require double-layer discs...""
Disc 5 contain ""Special Features"" only, not any episodes. And yes it fits on a regular DVD5 disc. For more details refer http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/series/VOY/dvd/set/5914.html
Disc 6: I don't understand 多? Contain two chapters of de Star Trek The Original Series (""Arena"" and ""The City On The Edge Of Forever"") and two DVD Trailers (""Deep Space Nine"" and The Next Generation"")"

,zeeowl,2009-01-23T22:39Z,"Thanks for this great upload kef71.  I've been looking for the series with French audio also, and this is perfect.

About discs 5 & 6: yes, they are ""bonus material"".  If you only want the episodes, they're on discs 1 to 4.

Just finished yesterday.  I'll be seeding on and off for a while.  Maybe ""forever"" once I fix my server. :)

Now on the season 2..."

I keep my torrent client running all the time - I'm constantly seeding torrents I've already downloaded, so once I have it you'll have one more seeder :)"
,markus2022,2010-03-02T06:07Z,At the risk of sounding like an Idiot. how do you watch the episodes? do I have to burn them to a disc? I unzipped them but its not all coming together right.
