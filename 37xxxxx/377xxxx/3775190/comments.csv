Also, once the files are available again, please be generous in your seeding--the fan base for this show is very small, and some fan-commitment will be necessary to keep these files available."
,throgbolt,2007-10-14T01:05Z,"13 Oct 2007 - Note On ""Schickele Mix"" Torrents:

I'm not the original seeder of these torrents, but I have a strong suspicion (and it's *only* a suspicion) that the orginator (""Roderick Spode"") is delaying seeding parts 2-5 until there is a sufficiently large  base of seeders for the existing torrents to insure that they won't rapidly die.  

Remember, P2P is the ONLY way ""Schickele Mix"" is now available. If you don't do your part seeding these files, other fans WILL NOT be able to listen to them --as we all know, there are no commercially available CDs that can be ripped and re-posted."
,rwk,2007-10-27T19:24Z,"dear Throgbolt and DoubleAught,

Sorry it took a while to respond to your messages..

The bottom line is that there is someone who has all these episodes and , for whatever the reason might be, unable or unwilling to share them with the rest of the world.

I am interested in contacting RoderickSpode somehow and ask he/she to reseed the episode 2-5.. I have even contacted someone who has Roderick Spode as a username on E bay thinking this might the one.. (it wasn't..)

Any idea how we can locate/contact the original seeder and convince him/her to upload the torrents again..? It is quite possible that the original seeder might not be aware of that the episodes 2-4 torrents are efeectively dead torrents.."

It seems very odd that there are NO seeders for parts 2-5. I suspect that the originator put the torrent files up with intent to seed them later, but still hasn't done so.

Like you, I did some fairly intensive Google searching for RoderickSpode, but no leads turned up. Roderick, if you're out there--please re-seed the files, or at least let us know what's up."
