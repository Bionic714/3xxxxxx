I guess he IS giving us an amiga emulator, though....

Oh, and as for idiots who don't know why anyone would want to 'dumb down' their pc, you never will know. We who used to own Amiga 500's, etc have memories that we might occasionally want to relive. Memories like Xevious, or Wardner, or Perihellion. 

Sure, they aren't as good as todays modern games, but only so far as graphics go. Back then, game comany's had to make games with durable game-play. Games that were worth playing. And amiga graphics shat on anything else at the time, too, anyway. So, we who want to live in the past for while, here and there. salute you Seeders.

May the Extra-Memory be with you."
,shinobiung,2010-02-04T18:40Z,"are we supposed to install all 4 applications here? because af2006plus.exe is a later make of amigaforever.iso. and win1430 installS a completely separate edition of winUAE.

at least give a partial explanation.

this edition doesnt seem to let you use additional amiga files"
