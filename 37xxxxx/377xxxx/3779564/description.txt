Lightspeed Champion - I Wrote And Recorded This Album In Less Than Five Hours
=============================================================================

Taking influences from such bands as Fleetwood Mac and The Smashing Pumpkins, through to Hall & Oates and Nirvana, Devonte Hynes (of Test Icicles fame) returns with new band Lightspeed Champion.

Today (Mon 20th Aug 2007) he, as the title suggests, wrote and recorded this album in less than five hours - making it available as a free download on the world wide web.

Dev says:

"Hope you like it remember.. I just did this for fun, and i felt like sharing it with you, so before the intense harsh criticisms and what not, and this is in no way an inclination into what my ACTUAL record will sound like .. I have to say this because people don't seem to understand alot of the time..hense the overly obvious title of the record haha... anyway here it is, enjoy....i had fun making it. so see it as fun!!"
