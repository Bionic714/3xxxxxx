Plot: In the heartland of Iowa, five grad school liberals (Cameron Diaz, Ron Eldard, Annabeth Gish, Jonathan Penner, and Courtney B. Vance) share a house, a left-wing outlook, and Sunday suppers filled with conversation and social criticism. But when a redneck trucker threatens one of their own, he inadvertently puts them on the radical road to serial murder. From soup to nuts, THE LAST SUPPER is "fiendishly funny." (Peter Travers, Rolling Stone).
