,jack_black,2007-08-18T04:27Z," - DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS! -
It's exactly the same as the Prevail release.
You won't get better quality by downloading this instead of http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3773941/High.School.Musical.2.STV.FS.SCR.XVID-PreVail

To say its DVD quality is wrong, cause this has the same framerate issue as Prevails release.
Just so you know!"
