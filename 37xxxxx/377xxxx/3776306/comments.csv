,bublet,2007-08-21T03:32Z,how do you install this?
,the-uploader-boy,2007-08-21T14:55Z,"read the readme.txt document..

Copy the ""Shell"" file and the luna.msstyles into your theme folder, for example: c:\windows\resources\themes
and double click the luna.msstyles and the change theme window will pop up and just choose the ""Royal Noir"" theme and it done!"
