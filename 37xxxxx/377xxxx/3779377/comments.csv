,greyhawk3,2007-08-23T19:45Z,"Frankly, I don't understand the question., but I won't be offended if you extract Slax from HawkPE and leave out the stuf I added to /modules.  But the point of adding those modules, is to provide users w/ a leg up, so they don't have to learn about making/downloading modules in order to use it (Slax.)

I think if you were really familiar w/ Slax, familiar enough to be discriminating, you'd already have downloaded the stock Slax CD on your own.  IAC, be my guest:  --  The Hawk  --"

,preludexl,2008-02-04T19:30Z,"Hawk or eXperience, how do you update the antivirus and spyware definitions onto the CD and make a new build?"
,greyhawk3,2008-02-14T17:58Z,"preludexl:  I will review the remastering instructions in the README, as they may not be clear, but that's where you'd go to update your disc.

Having said that, I have a working #40 build and will post it in the next seven days.  Later:  --  The Hawk  --"
