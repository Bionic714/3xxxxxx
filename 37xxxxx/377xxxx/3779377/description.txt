A fully-functional BartPE/WinPE (Windows XP SP2) + Linux (Slax-6-RC6)
live CD ISO.  Comes w/ Windows Explorer, AdAware SE + McAfee AV +
ClamAV + SpywareDoctor updated as of 20-Aug, SmartDriverBackup),
PCITREE, FoxIt PDF Reader, FileZilla FTP Client, Ghost 8, UltraVNC,
Partition Magic 8, CHNTPW (now Vista-compatible), WIPECMOS, MEMTEST,
the IBM/Seagate/WD hdrive diagnostics, etc.  Boots to BartPE by
default.  Download README-HAWKPE.TXT or HAWKPE-CHANGES.TXT in advance,
for details about the package.  *SIGNIFICANTLY* improved over previous
torrents.

Slax is an excellent example of a portable Linux, which comes w/
Firefox-2+Flash-9, KDE's KOffice suite, multimedia goodies, and the
latest K3B CD/DVD burning application.  So with a USB thumb drive and
your HAWKPE CD/DVD, you can carry a multimedia-enabled computer
system, with you at all times.  Enjoy....

Just fixed an annoying problem w/ initial video resolution that caused
BartPE to crash, on a handful of PCs.  If you've tried earlier
versions of HAWKPE, but had problems w/ the Linux part, Slax-6 plus
the changes to the main menu means that virtually everyone will be
able to use all of HAWKPE successfully.  Slax-6 also supports all new
motherboards, so that (in particular) SATA users will be able to enjoy
HAWKPE this time around.
