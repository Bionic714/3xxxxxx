? 	As Magdalena's (Emily Rios) 15th birthday approaches, her 
working class family prepares for the all-important Quinceanera - a lavish 
coming-of-age celebration. To help with expenses, Magdalena is forced 
to wear a hand-me-down party dress and abandon her dream of arriving 
in a Hummer limousine. But when her father discovers she's pregnant 
and refuses to believe the incredible truth - she's actually still a virgin - 
Magdalena moves in with her elderly Uncle Tomas (Chalo Gonz?lez) 
and black sheep cousin Carlos (Jesse Garcia). Her newfound family 
is soon put to the test, however, when an unexpected crisis threatens 
to tear them apart, and Magdalena learns what it truly means to come of age.
