But you people SEED !!! Thanks!"
,ZeNiTH_NL,2007-08-12T13:47Z,"Just another note: The sound of ""the Gods Must Be Crazy I"", appears to be out a of sync sometimes, but all the other versions of The Gods Must Be Crazy I on the internet have that same problem. It looks like the voices are put in the movie after it was finished or so. The source is probably crappy :) 

It doesnÂ´t really matter, because most voices are ""clicks"" or voices of the storyteller, who does not appear in the movie"".

Enjoy this movie! ItÂ´s a really good one."
,ZeNiTH_NL,2007-08-12T18:12Z,"Ah, I found it out. There is nothing wrong with the movie. The movie is indeed ""voice over"" (the original!)

So all three are okay! :)"

,sparky65,2010-06-06T08:54Z,"To answer Totto1969, according to Wikipedia, The Gods Must Be Crazy IV is the International English title. Crazy Hong Kong is the English title used in Hong Kong (and presumably adopted by other markets). Hope this helps."
