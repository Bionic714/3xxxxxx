This Ass Wipe keeps uploading the shit with multiable names... Go fuck your self with this shit, think you would at least add or delete something to make the file size different from all the others you uploaded..."

,Shnoky,2007-10-08T03:57Z,trojan my ass!! its not trojan. its part of the patch to make it work. geez you people are dumb. Thanks to the uploader. dont mind the people who says its got  a trojan. they dont know the beauty of your work and just kept on complaining. 
,Shnoky,2007-10-08T03:59Z,"and of course Antivirus branded it as a trojan, so that you cant use it. stupid! dont always believe what your antivirus tells you. it might be a false positive. "
,Shnoky,2007-10-10T02:06Z,"Scanned it with Kaspersky, NOD32 and Norton No virus or trojan. The stupid AVG is the only one detecting this as Trojan. Clearly its a false positive. "
,_AKUMA_,2007-10-19T04:45Z,"I had Norton scan a file I knew for sure was a trojan (ali.exe) and guess what?  It said that there was no threat detected, so even that last theory doesn't completely hold water.  You know why people upload crap with trojans in it?  So stupid fuckin n00bs like you people will download it.  Anyone who knows anything about the scene barely pisses with this lamer p2p crap.  This is the bottom of the ""food chain"" for piracy.  By the time the n00bs get it, anyone who really matters has played with it for days already.  www.aboutthescene.org   and wise up f00lz.;)"
,nevets0ryu0,2007-12-21T11:42Z,"y dont you newbies get a clue avg is shit i mean its Free and shit
