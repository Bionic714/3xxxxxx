Avg. Rating:  	
  4.2 / 5 (based on 13 ratings).

Plot:	Cynthia Khan reprises her role as Inspector Yeung as she teams up with Donnie Yen and Michael Wong in a case that initially is to track down some drug dealers in Seattle but widens into a much larger net that implicates the US government in wrong doing.

Overview:	When an immigrant Chinese dockworker comes into brief contact with secret evidence implicating American intelligence operatives and the Green Dragon Crime Syndicate in a major drug trafficking operation, he is marked for death. Now on the run and running out of time, his only hope for survival is two cops with nothing to hide and nothing to lose!

In a number of incredible action-set-pieces, leading man Donnie Yen shows off his fluid high-speed kicking and punching with an eclectic fighting style, which clearly owes much to the influences of Bruce Lee and legendary boxing champion Sugar Ray Leonard.

Cast: 	Cynthia Khan (Yeung Lai-Ching)  ||  Donnie Yen Ji-Dan  ||  Michael Woods  ||  Michael Wong Mun-Tak  ||  Yuen Yat-Choh
