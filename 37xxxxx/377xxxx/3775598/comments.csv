That's for some glass skins. I'm a fan of Unusual.

Thanks for the torrent Espionage."
,Espionage724,2007-09-10T23:34Z,"Hmm..don't know if the link to the Glass skin still works. On the WinAMP page I just did a search for ""Glass"" and it came up."
,L4rk3m0n,2007-09-11T04:19Z,"Thankyou for this great torrent Espionage. Also thanks to adeimantus for the link to some great skins, i love the longhorn themes n1 dude!"
,longxiahuang,2007-09-11T04:37Z,"Wicked. Cheers mate. From thinking 'this 2x burn speed is pissing me off' to finding the crack, to listening to my freshly burnt CD all in about 5min.

,Sejtan666,2007-09-11T15:09Z,thanks! Works perfect!!!
,Espionage724,2007-09-23T19:01Z,The glass skin from the WinAMP page is gone
,Espionage724,2007-09-23T19:03Z,"It keeps saying ""Database error"" when i try to put another link for it up lol. Its on WinCustomize though."
,Bubble_Tree,2007-09-30T17:26Z,"Keeps saying invalid key,am I doing something wrong? I tried with the - and with out and with 5.0 and 5.0 + key?"
,fajarrr,2007-10-01T22:37Z,its work thanks
,Bubble_Tree,2007-10-02T01:24Z,I keep getting invalid key with the keygen
,Espionage724,2007-10-03T06:16Z,"Hmmm...for the name space in the keygen, type any username you want (ex. Espionage724) and the key will appear. I press generate a few extra times also. Then copy and paste the username and password from the keygen into the winamp box."
,Bubble_Tree,2007-10-04T02:24Z,Thats what it was lol I wasn't changing the name in the keygen. Sorry about that thanks alot!!!
,NuclearZombie,2008-07-16T03:29Z,"So, is the only difference between regular Winamp and Pro the faster CD ripping times? 'Cause I hardly ever listen to CDs anyways so to me it would just be a waste of bandwidth if thats the only extra feature."
,linus817,2008-12-11T17:29Z,please seed
,nk22,2009-03-27T19:31Z,doesn't work for me. can't even open it just gives me an error :(
,YoyoChild,2010-11-11T02:28Z,Aesome torrent. Thanks. ^^
,Ramzes_,2011-01-15T20:59Z,Keylogger found.. Probably just the keygen or something.
,_Divinity,2011-03-28T00:08Z,"Keygen works like a charm for the newest version. Although all Winamp pro does is unlock the fastest rip and burn speeds, it's nice to have premium software. Thanks. :) "
,gr33nday,2011-10-02T12:22Z,"Thanks a lot! You need not even install it. Just put this to go pro:
