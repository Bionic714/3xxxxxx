? 	Supplies are dwindling. Troops are hopelessly outnumbered. 
But even in defeat there is victory. The defenders of the Philippines - 
including PT-boat skippers John Brickley (Robert Montgomery) and 
Rusty Ryan (John Wayne) - will give the U.S. war effort time to 
regroup after the devastation of Pearl Harbor.

Director John Ford's World War II tale knows its battle-scarred 
topic firsthand. Montgomery was himself a Pacific PT-boat commander 
and a valorous Bronze Star recipient. Ford filmed the Academy 
Award┬½-winning documentary Battle of Midway. And Wayne creates 
a portrait of patriotic resolve as only he can. They Were Expendable 
salutes all who expended themselves during some of the war's bleakest hours.
