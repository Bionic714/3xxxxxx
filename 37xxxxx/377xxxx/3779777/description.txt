â?¢ 	Set in 1897, Print Ritter (Duvall) and his estranged nephew 
Tom Harte (Hayden Church) become the reluctant guardians of five 
abused and abandoned Chinese girls. Ritter and Harte's attempts to 
care for the girls are complicated by their responsibility to deliver a 
herd of horses while avoiding a group of bitter rivals, intent on 
kidnapping the girls for their own purposes. Classic Western action!
