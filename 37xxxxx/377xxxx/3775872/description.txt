Plot: Michael Crichton, who wrote the screenplay, directs this near-future sci-fi/crime thriller that explores the classic theme of machines gone bad. Sgt. Jack Ramsey (Tom Selleck) is the police robotics expert on the case when evil genius Dr. Charles Luthor (Gene Simmons) unleashes his reprogrammed androids. Runaway also stars Cynthia Rhoades (Dirty Dancing) and Kirstie Alley ("Cheers").
