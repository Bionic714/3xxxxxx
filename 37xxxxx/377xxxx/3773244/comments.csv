,rjohnson1990,2010-02-28T08:54Z,"There's a nice little way to get away with this and make it more believeable too. All you do is get a screenshot of the address bar with the Habbo link in it and put the image in the top of the client page. There is one thing though. When someone clicks the link, you need to make sure it opens a window without navigation. If it doesn't, they will see the real address bar and the image right below it. Hope this helps out some."
