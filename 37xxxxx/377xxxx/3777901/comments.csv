,disir,2007-11-04T02:18Z,and the keygens dont work on vista i think
,freshbread,2007-12-19T14:39Z,"While I was installing it, avast! caught this

""Win32:Keygen-B [Trj]"" has been found in ""C:\Program Files\Game House\PopCap Mega Pack\Collapse Crunch\CollapseCrunchkeygen.exe"" file."
,sliced68,2008-02-12T05:57Z,"A quantity of the keygen executables (via my Vista laptop covered by comcast virus checkers) were found to have trojans and the like; suggest do not use less you are protected. Seems some work w/vista, some do not; no serious show stoppers."
,xcrimsonprophecyx,2008-06-01T22:53Z,"My BitDefender caught and deleted 5 ""Backdoor.VB.BAX"" Files. Whatever those are. This was about 11% through the installation. Don't waste your time with this download."
,xcrimsonprophecyx,2008-06-01T22:58Z,Oh and get this then the program crashed and it tried to send out an error report for me. Im using vista and that has never happened to me when a program crashes. Unless Bit D just caught only this one. EVERYONE stay away from this dl.
