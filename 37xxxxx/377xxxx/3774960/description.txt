 BHT In a Nut Shell  { Written by Jim}	
People often ask me, What is BHT? I usually end up giving a lengthy description, with the person no longer interested.

BHT is a compilation of Freeware applications, as well as some shareware and trial software. It was designed to help a computer technician with Spyware removal.

It is now a collection of tools, which are all hand-picked for specific uses. BHT is still focused to provide adequet spyware and virus removal tools, as well as a few accessories, such as a small codec pack, data backup tools, recovery tools, and many other useful utilities.

BHT has grown from a discontinued project, known as Bootzilla, to the well-organized, EULA-abiding package that it is today.
