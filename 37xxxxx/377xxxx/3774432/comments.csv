A .rar file is like a .zip file. You need to unzip the files, and then the movie will be in one complete, playable, file.
Use a program called WinRar (it's free) to open the files. Just click the first one, extract, and it'll open all 30+ files on it's own (you don't have to do it for each one). Then you're ready to watch."
