,SlimT,2008-03-27T11:05Z,"K, To all (Noobs) who dont get it working:

First off you need a mount program, if you have a program, and then mount and it says something with wrong disc, download this program instead:

poweriso guide
-----------------------------------------------------------
http://www.poweriso.com/
when you install poweriso make shure you mark every file type.
When you got poweriso restart youre computer
then start poweriso click mount, then set units or something, press 1
then you will see : unit [letter] klick on it then mount image go to youre directory you have downloaded the game then cd 1, and the .bin file
then the installation will start up

enof of poweriso guide
-----------------------------------------
when it asks for next cd, take up poweriso/youre  program and mount cd 2(.bin file)
when the insallation is done go to This Computer/KOTOR2_1 (Letter:)/crack
then copy the file: swkotor2(.exe)
to the directory where the game is, the defualt is: C:/Program/lucasarts/SWKotOR2
and overwhright, then launch the game with the file launcher(.exe) or swkotor2(.exe)
NOW PLAY!!!!"

Once you get past the trojan that comes with it.  Simple virus scan will pick it up (my picked up with AVG).  Click ""Heal"" won't fix it, you'll have to run a scan after installing.

Mount disc one, install, mount disc 2 when asked, continue, mount disc 3 when asked, continue, mount disc one and finish.

Update the game completely then apply the latest crack. [gamecopyworld.com]

,budgallant,2008-05-05T19:57Z,"cupofblue you are my savior, bro.

IMPORTANT:

The crack exe does work.  You don't need anything else...  I've been working on this for an hour, trying nearly everything. I installed, ran the updates (from game), and after copying over the .exe it gave an error.  This may be a VISTA issue.

Anyway, sure enough, just like cupofblue said, it suddenly worked with sound disabled from the config.  Since he was the only person here to mention this problem and a solution, I went ahead and go that new dll file and copied that over the old one.  Sure enough, it now works with sound...

cupofblue you are a genius. Thanks so much... I'll finally be able to play this now. I have no idea where you found that .dll, but it worked.

Note of caution: That GameCopyWorld version of the crack comes with a trojan, so I'd avoid that.  If you guys are having this problem (under Vista?), just go ahead and disable sound from config and see if it runs, and if it does, get the .dll, and it'll work with sound!"

Just mount disc 1, install, mount each disc when prompted and continue, finish installation,

update kotor with the launcher, then paste the crack into the installation directory and launch.

Should work fine, if it is lagging change your gfx settings, or force lower pixel shader, 2.0, 1.4, 1.1 or ff

Follow the first two points mentioned above by persiansoul.

If you find that the game immediately crashes on startup, download this file - 

http://files.filefront.com/Mss32dll/;6695046;;/fileinfo.html

Replace the mss32dll file in you directory with this downloaded one and everything should be fine.

,xxxmeatloafxxx,2008-06-20T21:12Z,"first of all, if it asks you to report that error to microsoft, dont do it, you're gonna broadcast that the version you have is an illegal version.

Anyway, just use deamon tools lite to ""mount"" (essentially the same as putting a CD into a CD drive) the .cue file.  if you use Daemon tools to ""mount"" everything, you wont need a crack or anything, you just will need more space.
First just get rid of all the data and start over and then procede to mount the .cue files when they ask for them (each .cue represents a disc and it will say which disc they represent in the file name).

btw the website to get Daemon Tools lite is 
http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=5

its the official website for daemon tools so there wont be any viruses packaged with the setup file"

Well, you installed the game right? after u install the game run the Patch that is in the folder ""Star.Wars.KotoR.2.UPDATE.v1.02b.CRACKED"" after you do that, mount the CD1 with daemon tools, open the CD and you will see the Crack folder open it, copy the rack the .exe not the folder and paste it in the directory where your kotor!!! when u paste it it will ask you if you are sure you wanna replace it, you say yes, after that u run the game perfectly :P i hope i could help!"
,berg555,2008-06-23T02:28Z,what is the director?
,Einsel,2008-06-23T07:07Z,"@berg555
The directory is wherever you see computer folders and files. In this case, you're looking for Lucas Arts somewhere in C Drive's Program Files."
,berg555,2008-06-23T17:55Z,"it still isnt working. Whenever I try and run the thing inside of the cracked folder the screen goes dark and then the message shows up saying it ran into a problem

,metodex,2008-06-24T09:45Z,hey people can you please seed this file? its going quite slow!!! im dying to play this game!!!

,matriexs,2008-06-26T14:02Z,"here is an intresting issue i have installed  the game 4 different times and every time after i finsih installing it  that it was not installed properly and i can not figgure out a solution i have been trying to solve it for last 2 days and when i try to update it tells me 

 The game is not installed. You must install the game.
Unable to read language setting from talk table.
Your game version is: 2.00.424 

i have also put the patch on and that at least let the game pop up to the title screen but then it has the title screen and the character standing their but no words so basicly im out of ideas"
,paralyzedmime,2008-06-27T11:37Z,"ok, howabout this one?

i already know how to do everything.. i use DaemonTools Lite..

so.. i mounted disc 1.. it asked for disc 2.. and i unmounted disc 1 and mounted disc 2.. and so on and so forth all the way through disc four.. 

but after disc four.. it asks me to put the ""star wars knights of the old republic II GAME DISC"" in.. there isn't a game disc folder..

i haven't done anything yet.. i was thinking i'd try to cancel [assuming that the ""game disc"" would be just to pull up the main menu, and not to actually install more files]

so.. i'm going to mess around with it a bit.. but.. if someone realizes how stupid i am and what i'm missing.. tell me, please :)"
,paralyzedmime,2008-06-27T11:48Z,"ok, nevermind, apparently i just needed to mount disc 1 again.. "
,gopher663,2008-06-29T01:11Z,seed plz. at least at 30kb/s per seeder. that would make all the diff in the world.
,wir2ox,2008-06-29T12:11Z,"OK.
This torrent is great and game and image files works perfectly, so do not complain about it.

Now, OK again.
To all who didn't STILL get this working:
Make sure you have finished downloading,
ok, check on that,
now make sure you have some program downloaded and installed to open image files like Daemon Tools or something like that,
now you should see small icon(s) down on your screen, right there where clock is, 
find there Daemon Tools icon or whatever you are using(Some programs might not have this small icon) so right click on it,
Virtual Cd/Dvd rom or something,
Device 0/1 or something,
Mount image,
now go to your downloads folder, 
It's usually ""My Documents\Downloads\"",
if you don't know where the hell it is(Even I don't know sometimes so don't worry about it),
open your torrent software e.g µTorrent, 
now if you haven't already deleted this torrent from your download list then you improvise... but if you haven't deleted it,
right click on 'Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II The Sith Lords' on your download list,
you should see there something like this ""Open containing folder"" or something like that, click on it there should be now new windows explorer(folder) opening,
and now you should know where your download folder is,
so go back to daemon tools and browse on your download folder when you have clicked on Mount Image stuff and etc etc.
Now when you have FINALLY found your ""Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II The Sith Lords"" folder that you have just about 27 hours ago downloaded,
open CD1 folder,
and now there should be some weird file, 
open it with Daemon Fucking Tools and then start fucking installing...
Now when installer says some shit Put in some fucking disc which contains some crap on it,
just mount next CD,
when it first time says some shit,
mount CD2!!!
When next time... CD3
and so on!
And when you have installed all 4 cds and it still says some shit,
just mount CD1 again..
So easy..
Now when you have installed whole fucking game on your computer,
DO NOT FUCKING REPLACE ORIGINAL swkotor2.exe with cracked swkotor2.exe,
because otherwise you will need to do this all again or download manual patch and install it
(Don't know if manual patch will work after all this, because I didn't have ANY troubles installing or playing game).
So now when you have finally fucking downloaded,
cryed,
mounted,
cryed again,
installed,
cryed again,
updated,
and NOW you cry again because you don't know what the hell am I suppose to do?!?!11
Well let me tell you wth you are supposed to do?!?!11
GO TO YOUR DOWNLOADS FOLDER and open up ""Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II The Sith Lords"" folder,
open ""Star.Wars.KotoR.2.UPDATE.v1.02b.CRACKED"" folder, now you will see cracked swkotor2.exe,
copy it and paste it on your ""SWKotOR2"" folder,
it will ask you ""Do you want to replace and etc etc"" Click YES and you'r ready to play.
Btw... if you don't know where your ""SWKotOR2"" folder is,
let me give you a tip,
mine is ""D:\Program Files\LucasArts\SWKotOR2""
And I'm sorry for my lang,
but I'm drunk.
Hope this comment helped you in any way."

,SemiAutoRob,2008-09-04T04:08Z,"HERE IS A STEP BY STEP GUIDE ON HOW TO GET THIS TO WORK. I AM RUNNING VISTA.

STEP1: Mount Disk1 with demon toolz
STEP2: When it asks for disk 2, mount it and press ok.
STEP3:Repeat for disks 3 and 4.
STEP4:Update the game by running it and clicking update.
If it has an error just follow the given instructions on how to manually patch the game.
STEP5: Copy the crack (Located in the torrent you downloaded, right under the disk 4 file.)and paste it into the KotOR file in your hard drive.
STEP6: Run KotOR and enjoy!

Also, if your game crashes just download Mss32.dll (google it) and replace the one in the KotOR file in your hard drive.

Have fun script kiddies!"
,cgilmore93,2008-09-04T15:27Z,how do u seed
,solknald,2008-09-05T02:56Z,"If you have installed the game correctly, patched it and put the crack in the correct place tried the mss32.dll fix and it still doesnt run then try this.

The game seems to have problems with a lot of soundcards, some say replace mss32.dll or turn sound off. 

I did something similar, the mss32.dll didnt work on it's own. i mean i could get into the game but only by turning off the sound, but who wants to play without sound ???
from previous experience i guessed the problem might be in the \Miles directory.

i happened to have KotoR installed, so i went to the \miles directory there...and curiously it had 3 m3d files less and the mss32.dll was directly in that folder..

So i decided to remove files from the miles folder in the KotoR II installation that wasnt in KotR..and add the mss32.dll to the folder(you shouldn't delete the mss32.dll from its original location just copy it to the \miles folder)

the 3 files i deleted was :

Mssa3d.m3d
mssdx7.m3d
mssrsx.m3d

Now normally if i ran the game with sound, nothing would happen, it would just snag 11.4 mb of memory and not do anything. After removing the aboved mentioned 3 files everything was working as intended and i was a happy camper....

If you have similar problems i hope the above fix works for you too"

if anybody has had the same problem please fill me in on how to fix it."
,ChewyTaco,2008-09-10T19:43Z,"Sorry but this does not work. Waste your time downloading the game, install the game, because if you patch it from the LucasArts site, then use the crack that was included in this torrent, the game works half ass.

There's a major drawback. After you create a new character and go to play the game, the game only works to the Star Wars opening credits movie, then it goes to a loading screen, then it goes to a black screen. Then... the program locks up, you can't alt+tab out of it or ctrl+alt+delete out of it. You'll have to hard reset your computer.

This is a big disappointment. I'm rating the torrent down because the game is broken.

I tried everything. I played KotOR 1 with no problems and no lag and I'm running it with a great computer. I copied the mss32.dll file from the miles folder of my KotOR 1 to the KotOR 2 miles folder and got rid of the other three files and to my amazement, there was still no success.

I blame Obsidian, honestly, Bioware should have made this game. It would have not been such a fuck up disaster.

THIS DOES NOT WORK. Install works, patch works, crack works, the game will run, however, the game will crash after you begin a new game."
,ChewyTaco,2008-09-10T19:53Z,"After having hunted for a solution I found that a lot of black screen problems in this game happen with LAPTOP USERS... and people with ATI Graphics cards.

,perrinbobby,2008-09-29T21:21Z,"If you've tried everything.... read solknald's comment on page 13........

This DOES work for vista

FINAL GUIDE TO INSTALLATION (STEPS MUST BE DONE IN ORDER)

1.Mount disc 1 using daemon/ Alcohol110

2.Run disc 1 and then mount discs 2,3, and 4 when prompted. 
[Initial setup should now be complete]

3.Update by downloading and running patch from http://www.lucasarts.com/support/update/kotor2.html
(update interface in game menu does not work)

4.Replace file ""swkotor2"" in C:/Program Files/LucasArts/Swkotor...with ""swkotor2"" from dowload.

5. Replace file ""Mss32.dll"" in C:/Program Files/LucasArts/Swkotor... with ""Mss32.dll"" file downloaded from here: http://files.filefront.com/Mss32dll/;6695046;/fileinfo.html

6. Copy the new ""Mss32.dll"" into C:/Program Files/LucasArts/Swkotor/Miles...

7.Delete files ""Mssa3d.m3d"", ""mssdx7.m3d"" and ""mssrsx.m3d"" from C:/Program Files/LucasArts/Swkotor/Miles

8. Run game. 

If that doesn't work buy it secondhand for your Xbox."
,fariq69,2008-09-30T09:57Z,can someone help with my problem?
,mds84,2008-10-01T04:26Z,"yea so i know this thread probably hasn't been visited in a while, but i seriously need help, lol. i'm pretty experienced in how to do this, and it seems fairly easy for vista users like myself. Yet daemon tools refuses to read the image. 

Let me specify: i've mounted disc 1 using both daemon tools and PowerIso, yet everytime i click on ""autorun"" or ""swkotor"" my computer doesn't do anything. It's like i never clicked on it--my computer refuses to even get to the autorun menu because it won't load...i don't know why, i'm going to have to contact daemon tools, but that could take days for me to receive a reply...i know it could be worse, but i was really psyched to play this tonight.

so, is anybody else having trouble loading up the installation files? like, the disc is showing up under My Computer, and i can explore it and everything, but any time i try to do the autoron.exe or swkotor.exe, nothing happens. anybody?

thanks!"

,random_apple,2008-10-08T22:29Z,"IT DOES WORK ON VISTA
 trust me,i have a laptop with vista home premium,is what i did was mount images with daemon tool lite 1,2,3 4 and then one again when it asks,then i went to where the file installed copyed and pasted the crack swkotor2.exe and replaced the other thing that was there,then it only worked with the sound off so i followed that other guys instructions and went to where it was installed and went into the miles folder then deleted took out the files Mssa3d.m3d

 in there and then copyed the crack into there but not taking it away from the origanal folder,sorry about da way i wrote dis,might be confusing for some people,thanks raven :)"

Thx raven!"
,TehChsn1,2008-10-13T22:14Z,Well this was a very good Torrent. For one it actually worked on my computer. I was reading every comment before I decided to download it and take the chance. Took a bit less than 10 hours to download but it worked fine ^_^
,TehChsn1,2008-10-13T22:31Z,"Here's a little step by step process of what I did to run it on XP:

Step 1 - Download DAEMON Tools Lite (4.30.1), found here [http://www.soft82.com/download/Windows/Daemon_Tools]

Step 2 - Download the Torrent, obviously.

Step 3 - Left click the DAEMON icon at the bottom right hand corner of your screen, which appears there after you download it, and click on Virtual CD/DVD-ROM then hover the mouse over Device and mount the image necessary. Mount and Unmount the images that you are prompted to for CD's 1-4.

Step 4 - Remount CD 1 when asked after the instillation has completed and proceed to update. If you cannot update it from the menu, then proceed to manually update it. You can download the manual patch here [http://www.lucasarts.com/support/update/kotor2.html]

Step 5 - After update is complete, look for the folder called ""Star.Wars.KotoR.2.UPDATE.v1.02b.CRACKED"" which should be located in the ""Saved"" folder of whatever Torrent downloader you used to download this torrent with.

Step 6 - Copy the file in that folder to you Kotor 2 directory, mine was located here (C:\Program Files\LucasArts\SWKotOR2), and paste directly in there, clicking yes to overwrite.

Step 7 - Make sure that CD 1 is mounted on DAEMON Tools Lite, then double click the icon that was pasted into the Kotor 2 directory and play.

Note: On the Menu that pops up upon launch of Kotor 2, where it says configure. My settings are at the lowest settings possible. My computer isn't good so it had to be that way for me. And on the graphics settings for the game I took off the grass and shadow effects. Not sure if this helps it run better, but I haven't had a problem since the download."
,TehChsn1,2008-10-13T22:33Z,"Sorry for the long comment, but I hope that helps some people :D"
,N3lc120,2008-10-17T09:04Z,does this game support any other patches out there?
,truthy,2008-10-22T00:35Z,"besides kotor 1 this is one of my most favourite games. this is how i got it to work (using XP sp3 and a nvidia card - can't say anything using vista or ati cards)

1. mount the cds 1-4 and 1 at the end and install the game
2. install the correct 1.0b patch for the US-Version, can be found here (becaus it's NOT already patched!): http://knightsoftheoldrepublic.filefront.com/file/TSL_Patch_US_Version;41126
3. use the 1.0b crack from GCW

by now it should already work.
there is also a official 'patch' for better ingame movies and music - here: http://www.nzone.com/object/nzone_kotor2_downloads.html"
,truthy,2008-10-22T00:35Z,"and there ary MANY mods arround for some very nice changes and improvements - I personally use these:
- All Classes are Skill Classes Mod
- Handmaiden Mod
- Slender Body for Females Mod
- Ultimate Saber Mod
they can be found here: http://knightsoftheoldrepublic.filefront.com/files/Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_II/Mods;5555

and like kotor 1 it also can be altered to use Widescreen Resolutions (with a few quirks)
you'll find instructions at WSGF - in my opinion the game still looks awesome with 16AF & 8AA @ 1680x1050"

I'm a noob when it comes to this torrent buisness, but I'm not retarded. I can read, and understand 17 pages of posts explaining their successes, and I can usually apply enough guess work to fix problems like this. But NOTHING is working. Same Problem;

After creating a character, and watching (or skipping) the beginning cut scene it closes down with the windows error ""Program has stopped Running, Windows is looking for a Solution"" (Which is never does lol).

I've already:
- Tried several different Installation sequences
- Just adding Crack without Patching
- Playing without Sound
- Replacing Mss32.dll file with the filefront one.
- Changing the Compatibility of several files to XP Service Pack 2.

Does any software genius have a light bulb on this one?

Think about it, if you use the cheat to get you 50,000 credits, what good is 2,000?  if you use god mode, then this game is basically a point-and-click dialogue game for you.

Anyway for all the vista users, look on page 13 about patching it up from the LucasArts site first and then replacing it with the swkotor2.exe.  Surprisingly, I didn't have to replace the original swkotor2.ini file with the provided duplicate file and it still worked fine.

Those users running vista the game often crashes. Whilst i was playing around with my settings this mourning I figured out why it continues to crash. Here is the problem I had before:
Every time I tried to run the game It would crash as soon as I clicked on the .exe ""this game has encountered an error"" it would bitch about. What I have done is changed all of the graphics settings, resolution, framerate to their minimum using the swconfig.exe. There is no problem with my pc not being able to handel it (8800GT, Quadcore Intel Q9300) but I have heard it is one of vistas many flaws. Also insted of using a crack for the game, because many i discovered didnt work i just used the old fashion method.

Mount the first disc in daemon tools and I used YASU to cloak it. (Not sure weather YASU is needed but w/e) and then run the game FROM THE DISC!. Have fun...

Also my game is not patched it is at Version 1.0(says notepad) or 2.0(says game)

the problem is inevitable for LAPTOP users which have the Intel graphic chipset. even when you run hardware test it says that the graphic card doesn't meet the recommended specs, even if the card is better than the listed crap. however, even with this problem, on the official support website you can learn that updates fix issues with intel chipset 915 (unfortunately i have 945).

1. Mount the CD's one by one in Daemon tools.
2. Once it's installed, go to the crack folder, take the .exe file in there, and replace it with the identical .exe file in the folder you installed the game to. 
3. Go to this site and download the mss32.dll file: http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?mss32
4. Copy the ORIGINAL mss32.dll file in your INSTALL folder and move it to a temporary place (a folder, your desktop, doesn't matter. Just DON'T delete it!)
5. Take the mss32.dll that you JUST DOWNLOADED and place it in the install folder. It will replace the original, but you still have that backup! After this, if you try and launch the game, you'll get an error message at startup.
6. To fix that, delete the new mss32.dll file out of your install folder. Take the original one that you copied and placed elsewhere and place it BACK in the install folder.

,recon_666,2010-11-18T00:55Z,"HOW TO INSTALL:

1. Download Daemon tools or Magic ISO, you can google the program names in order to get a download link.

2. In your system tray, simply rightclick on the icon (silver circle with a blue zap) and select mount image. 

3. Browse the downloaded KoToR2 folder and mount the imagine in CD1

4. Start the installation and when asked to insert the next CD simply click on your deamon tools icon again, select mount image, browse the CD2 folder and select. Etc etc with CD3+4

5. Update the game, you want the latest patch, also check out http://knightsoftheoldrepublic.filefront.com/files/Knights_of_the_Old_Republic;67index for restored content and incredibly perfect and updated addons and hidden game content.

6. Copy the crack from the download folder into your SWkotor2 directory and play the game. If the crack doesn't work, you can get another one from gamecopyworld.com

PS: GAME CRASH FIX

This is a very unstable game, and just like SWkotor1 it is full og bugs and errors. Newer graphic hardware AND software is not compatible with these old games and user may experience a lot of trouble while attempting to play or boot the game.

Solution: Latest software and hardware forces games to run with new programming, however it is possible to disable. 

---- In ur kotor folder, you have to find the SWkotor file, not the exe but the .ini 
It is a 3kb file which you can open with Notepad

When you open it, scroll down to [Graphic Options] and after the command lines under this section add the following line: 
Disable Vertex Buffer Objects=1

This fix works for Windows XP 32-64 as well as Vista.

(Vista may need a additional crack and dos file in order to run the game, but such can be downloaded and found on google as well)

Hope this helps :)"
,scootertroy,2010-12-29T04:38Z,"I followed all directions , worked perfectly great older game, its also very worth patching the game with the updated high quaility soundtrack, and movie videos.

THANKS"
,Slinky_Boy,2011-01-15T05:40Z,"I've tried everything and my game still crashes after the cut scene after character customization. 

I Have put the crack in the folder, I have the vista crack (even though I'm running it on Windows 7, the vista crack should still work.), I've changed the SWkotor.ini file and I've changed the compatibility settings for the shortcut.

What do I need to do to make it work?"

Right after the ebon hawk movie finishes it stops and says kotor 2 has stopped working and windows says close the program. I have an emachines e525 (I know that is a shitty comp) and I have kotor I on it (which works perfectly on the highest graphics).

listen i just made an account for the soul purpose of telling you people to download the 1.0b update (should sort its self out for you) and to use both the Mss.dll and the cracked application you find in the last set of folders (replace the original in program files)"
,Logico91,2012-01-15T21:45Z,followed all the advice on here and got it working thanks guys. Make sure you run the game from the launcher.exe and not the main exe file btw if anyones having issues with it crashing on startup

,CtpButyok,2012-02-25T10:17Z,"Allright brothers. 

The torrent itself is fine, I guess but the game itself is buttfucked beyond all repair. The Windows 7 users who managed to play this game have my outmost respect.

-I've installed the game
-updated the latest patch
-downloaded the crack file corresponding to latest patch
-set the compatibility mode
-changed the mss32.dll
-disabled sound
-ran it as moderator
-added ""Disable Vertex Buffer Objects=1"" to graphic options
-tried everything

This shit still crashes right after character creation. Nothing I can do, after 2 days of sucking dick  and countless re-installs, I give up. 

Obsidian Entertainment can go and fuck itself in the arse. I won't install a goddamn Windows XP op system just so I can run this motherfucking game. 

Windows 7 users beware, getting it to work is virtually impossible, I wish all of you the best of luck and patience."
,charlo718,2012-03-26T07:17Z,"hey everyone, im installing the game now, i did all the mounting, and when it asked for the 2nd disc, i mounted that, but it seems the installer is stuck on ""credits.bik""...how exactly would i go about fixing this issue?

After downloading the game, updating and applying the crack I start the game like normal. At the home screen I click new game and create my ""Exile"" and start! After the opening cinematic is the tutorial with T3 (God I miss this game so much) if you all remember, but before I even see any gameplay starwars crashes and gives me the old ""The program has stoped working"". Im running on Windows 7 64 bit and have tried getting this game to work for nearly a month now. ANYTHING that you may know that would help me get this game to run would be very helpful. Thanks! :D"
