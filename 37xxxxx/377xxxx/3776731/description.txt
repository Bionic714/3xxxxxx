Harriet Rubin What do Warren Buffett and Rupert Murdock have in common with Titian and Bach? Just as artistic skill is honed over years of hard work and many a masterpiece was created late in an artist창??s life, these Late-Style leaders are rejuvenating leadership instead of handing off their power.

About the author:
I have studied leadership development for the last twenty five years. In the 1980s, I published the first business bestseller in 30 years, a book describing a brand new business method: Theory Z, the clarion call on the power of Japanese management and how Toyota and others were about to eat Detroit창??s lunch. In the 90s, I started the first business book division, Currency, devoted to the changes a new cadre of workers창??Baby Boomers창??were making in organizations. After leaving Currency, I wrote books as well as for Fast Company and Inc., and more recently The Wall Street Journal. This May, Warner published The Mona Lisa Stratagem: The Art of Women, Age and Power, which is the basis of the ideas in this manifesto.

-LEGAL TORRENTS

Purpose:

create a balance, share the already free stuff,
public domain works, freeware, free music,
free ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.

show the copyright owners that torrent
websites shouldn't bear the responsibility
of what their users upload, torrent websites
are very much similar to google..

users upload what they want to upload,
download what they want to download,
and search for what they want to search..

by creating this balance and sharing the already free
stuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..
