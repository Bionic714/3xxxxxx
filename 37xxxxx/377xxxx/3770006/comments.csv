Thank you for this!!!"
,farlight2007,2007-08-13T19:16Z,This Torrent is stalled there's another one running
,badlands,2007-08-15T21:00Z,"Brilliant torrent, especially when the uploader never are logged on to share. Leechers only reach a few percent of this torrent, seems like you have to wait forever. Nah, fuck it, I'll find this stuff on Soulseek instead - having waited a week for merely 7,1% is just a bad uploader getting people pissed. "
,badlands,2007-08-15T21:01Z,"PLEASE don't insult our intelligence by telling us that this torrent has stalled and there's another running, since that torrent is just as stalled as this one. Why put out stuff when you don't have the equipment - brain or technique - to share?"
,Shadowmaker,2007-08-17T18:04Z,"Man, this must be the worst uploader ever! Having great albums like this - or is it just a big fake - and cannot download to people. Amateur or just asshole? With this rate it should be finished by October 2009. I'll find my stuff elsewhere and upload those albums at a decent DL-speed for everyone. This just sucks bigtime."
