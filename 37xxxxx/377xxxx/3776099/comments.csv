How come I never even heard of this film I wonder...
Looks interesting!
Cheers."
,@dog,2009-04-15T12:30Z,"Would someone possibly have the HBO movie ""Grey Gardens"", starring Drew Barrymore and Jessica Lange? It airs on Sunday but I'm sure it's circulating already."
,votsko,2009-04-21T02:13Z,This is **not** the 2009 version found on HBO. This movie is from 1975
,Mike727,2009-04-29T08:15Z,"I just saw the HBO film. It was incredible, and I went into it expecting it to be awful and knowing nothing of the original film. Now I can't wait to watch the original. Thanks for seeding!"
