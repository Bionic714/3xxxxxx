Plot: Meet Big and Little Edie Beale?high-society dropouts, mother and daughter, reclusive cousins of Jackie O.?thriving together amid the decay and disorder of their ramshackle East Hampton mansion. An impossibly intimate portrait and an eerie echo of the Kennedy Camelot, Albert and David Maysles?s 1976 Grey Gardens quickly became a cult classic and established Little Edie as a fashion icon and philosopher queen.
