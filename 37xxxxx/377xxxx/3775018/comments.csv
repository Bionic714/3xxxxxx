Would advise people to run tracks through MusicBrainz before adding to their collection, though."
,zzPenciLiClickzz,2008-02-12T03:15Z,"getting the files right now, what does MusicBrainz do?"
,VeritasInfinite,2008-03-06T01:05Z,"If you have ears that can tell the difference between a 160 and a 192 bitrate, then you are some kind of sorceror, my friend."
,daebat,2008-04-20T17:39Z,since when did incubus have anything to do with A Perfect Circles - 3 Libra's?  and since when is 2004 bonus even a cd?  Somebody is giving me the ID-10T error.
,core_82,2008-04-29T16:22Z,"The Make yourself CD is ripped from a scratched CD, really annoying. There is a difference in clarity on 160 and 192 bitrate for sure, i guess only some people can hear it."
