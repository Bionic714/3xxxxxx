,Staple,2007-08-18T18:17Z,"What are the formats ? Last time I saw Gearge Carlin complete here on P.B, there was something fishy about it. I'm not sure what it was, but either some strange format that was impossible to play and/or you had to get some stupid password from some shifty porn site. Are these torrent straight ? Do you have to get password from another site... etc. I love George Carlin but if it's a scam...... then...(it's not like George Carlin).... funny."
,Lazer23,2007-08-19T02:45Z,"There are various formats... most of the are in mp3, videos are in .avi or something like that. Trust me dude, this is not a rip off. I have no access to viruses or porno passwords, I'm just a 14 year old kid with a lot of time on his hands."
,rpatyk,2007-08-20T09:57Z,PLEASE SEED  IM STUCK AT 98 PERCENT
,Lazer23,2007-08-23T07:13Z,"No way dude!

I could have sworn I seeded this all the way. I let it sit there all night.... "
,Masklinn,2007-09-16T16:02Z,Would it be possible that someone seeds? There currently are more than half a dozen person waiting at 98.2% of the file and at least as many under that who'll get stuck sooner or later.
,WIFI84,2007-09-16T17:08Z,"Hi Lazer23, if possible then please (re)seed this post as many people are stuck at 98.2 (98.3)..."
,999999jase,2007-11-26T22:25Z,"please seed someone, been stuck at 92% for ages"
,999999jase,2007-11-26T22:25Z,i mean 98%

,Joe_purdy,2008-03-21T12:00Z,if someone seeds till i get a 100% i will seed out 30 copies.
,lordspamelot,2008-04-08T23:50Z,I'm not seeing any seeds in Azureus... Lazer are you sure you're seeding it? If anyone gets a full copy seed it please : \
,yurt101,2008-10-03T21:05Z,anyone wanna seed it shows 0 seeds and this is the only complete collection i know of.. of George Carlin... 
,GamesoulMaster,2009-03-20T10:20Z,"And yet... we really have no idea if this is even a full collection or not. Because the uploader decided it'd be a wonderful idea to zip all these, despite the fact that compressing lower quality MP3's and AVI's is nearly worthless. And of course, nobody can see what's actually in here without getting it. Naturally, there are *0* seeds for this right now too, further compounding the issue.

If you want audio files, your best shot is to check out this torrent, which doesn't seem to be 100%, but is at least a relatively full (and easily accessible) torrent of his audio works. At least, nobody seems to have complained yet...:

If you're looking for great quality videos of his works, the following torrent seems to be the good one (plenty of seeds, and it's actual ISO's instead of crappy quality AVI's):
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4623709/George_Carlin_-_All_My_Stuff

If you don't have the bandwidth or disc space for those better quality videos... well, there's plenty of great low quality collections around his of his video stuff.

Otherwise... I'm pulling together as full a collection of his audio works as possible (all 128 kbps MP3 or better), and I will upload that just as soon as it's complete (or as complete as possible).

You will not be forgotten George Carlin."
