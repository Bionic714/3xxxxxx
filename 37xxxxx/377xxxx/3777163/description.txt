rG have released Music Collection 2, Music Collection 2 is apparently a good program for archiving your MP3 collections. To me this just looks like another music catalogue being released, but feel free to prove me wrong.

?Music Collection? is software for managing your audio files on hard drive or CDs. It offers many features to easy cataloging, exporting and listening your favorite songs. Cover pictures downloading used in CoverMe! software was implemented, so program can now find and search cover arts of your albums and download them to computer. New version was announced as 1.05 but this feature is so important that we decided not to mark this only as new release but complete new version 2.

    * Songs sorted by artists
    * Songs sorted by artist with specified letter
    * Artists with album selection
    * Files as they are saved on disk (in directory tree structure)
