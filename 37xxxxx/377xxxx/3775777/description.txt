Plot: Melvin Van Peebles\' comedy-drama centers on white-bread racist Jeff Gerber (Godfrey Cambridge), who seems to have it all -- a house, a loving wife and two kids. In fact, he\'s doing just fine as long as the blacks don\'t move in and ruin his neighborhood. But Jeff\'s bigoted world is rocked when his skin unexplainably turns dark overnight. Now shunned by white people, Jeff begins to see the light with help from some new black friends.
