,SJC2TK,2007-08-15T20:49Z,i have had no problems with any spyware or virus's .... i even uninstalled and reinstalled all programme's and had no problems...... i viruis scanned before i upped 
,kernel_klink,2007-08-17T02:37Z,"For crying out loud you idiots !!!!   Think about this for a minute.  Damn near every single password recovery program, and every installation key recovery program will show up as a hacker tool / virus / Trojan on just about every scanner.

Don't believe me?  Go to www.snapfiles.com, download Magic Jelly Bean key finder.  It's virus free, but every virus and spyware scanner calls it a trojan or hacking tool and deletes or quarantines it.

Grow up.  Grow a brain.  Then use it.  At least once."
,etrini,2007-10-14T01:11Z,Wait this is only shareware why the hell upload?
,cxwxb777,2008-02-12T12:12Z,You guys do know that if every one would set there Net.max_halfopen to 40 we would all be downloading at 700k?
,Dalej,2008-03-07T14:03Z,"It's a bunch of trojans, dont install it. 
You won't find any trojans untill it starts to unpack/install AIO_PassRecover.exe

Don't listen to kernel_klink, he's an idiot, or one of the hackers.

Sorry."
,djpruce,2008-03-18T19:25Z,"Yeah, don't go for this one.  I""ve had the elcomsoft apps before without getting a virus warning and this package blew a virus before I was even able to install it.  If you need password recovery, just search for elcomsoft."
,AMD freak,2008-03-22T10:25Z,"Here is some good advice for the noobs and all the miss-informed out there in torrent land.....lol

The halfopen limit only affects the connection attempts you can make at once. It does NOT affect how many fully established connections you can have at once. The limit does not apply to incoming connections.

Reduce the net.max_halfopen value if you find you're having connection trouble. Set the net.max_halfopen back to the default of 8. There's no reason to have it higher!

*** There is no need to patch tcpip.sys if you adjust your halfopen connection attempts properly! ***"
,popeye1988,2008-04-02T20:55Z,"okay, since everyone -mostly- talks like they know their stuff tell me this; how can i register macromedia director when i got it from here? i need the program asap but i dont want it just for 30 days, know what i mean? so, who can answer that?"
,devanz2008,2008-04-27T01:58Z,"Depends what version you have but

,roblespar,2009-01-20T18:27Z,I have to agree with common sense. If a anti-virus program recognises trojans and viruses then it's time to remove the uploaded torrent. Symantec AV picked up 3 infections.
,Butterzroxxx,2009-01-30T02:44Z,i know you said since its a password program or whatever itll show up as a trojan or what not. well it is. i cant even log into my other computer now. so thanks a lot SJC2TK
,t34mod85,2009-03-17T13:08Z,"kernel_klink 
Typical users, don't even try to think in that direction... They will NEVER grow a brain... 

-_-"
,jimolina,2009-04-15T01:01Z,"so, SJC2TK, is it or is it not?"
,diddyman4real,2009-11-26T02:07Z,"at that kernel_klink dude.

If you knew ANYTHING about DL'ing shit you'd know that astalavistatorrent.com is one of the worst places to get quality torrents. This one has the potential to fuck up the day of an advanced pc user, like myself, and/or destroy the pc of your everyday joe of the web. Shove this torrent up the ass of the uploader plz!"
