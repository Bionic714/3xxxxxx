The place, Rio de Janeiro.

This airport needs no presentations. That's the huge gateway to Rio: Antonio Carlos Jobim International Airport, Worldly known as Gale√£o Int'l / SBGL.

We don't have much more to say about it. We just ask you to see the screenshots bellow. Take a look at the level of details, the quality of the textures, the care taken to build this gorgeous airport.

This is our new quality standard, low frame rate impact as it has always been, amazing 3D objetcs as ever, and customized textures carefully made in a way to give you all the real airport atmosphere you need to fly the way you like and need to Rio.

There are two independent installers: one for FS9 and another to FSX. You may choose each one to use, or have both if you preffer and use both sims. No problem on that, you order just one airport and receive two.

That's all. Enjoy the screens and prepare your flight plans.

Go to Rio!!!
