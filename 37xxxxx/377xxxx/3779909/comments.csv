No, it is very big the files, I rared it simply for the sake of a faster download. For people, get winrar at rarlabs.com download and install, then right click the rar files, and click extract files, and a big rar DOES not denote a virus.

But thanks for the seeding, downloading and enjoying =]"

That's because the songs are contained in a rar file. Use WinRar or 7zip to extract."
