,adam1976,2007-08-28T22:47Z,Excellent piece of freeware. Easily converted an OGM format file to AVI just in a few clicks. Highly recommended
,Bullybeef,2008-01-11T19:11Z,"I have previously downloaded this direct from the website, a great bit of kit. But they forget to tell you its a demo"
,Undead505,2008-02-02T00:20Z,i know it is so stupied
,arata75,2008-03-23T00:26Z,yea i dl'd it from the site too. they didnt say anything about it being a demo. but now wen i want to convert this movie i just dl'd they start with the billing. bullshit. i came on tpb to find a free version but all i got was this shit. why dl a torrent wen u can dl it from the website way faster AND for free?
,Newb787,2008-08-20T08:33Z,"No crack or serial for this one?  Certainly makes it convenient to convert to your iPhone, as long as you buy it as it's not freeware. "
,imeem,2008-09-22T02:12Z,this is the full version right?
,skyriderdk,2008-09-22T22:44Z,"they start to remove few features in the new versions,like convert to mkv....but still great tool.."
,imeem,2008-10-03T02:48Z,This is still the Demo!!!!!!!
,gringo0103,2008-11-07T22:47Z,"If anybody could find a kgen...meanwhile, there is this freeware that works pretty well : ""Free video converter""."
,FSimmer,2008-12-13T01:48Z,Hey everyone its not a permanent  solution but to get the full version set you computer time back to the date before you downloaded it. i know its not much but at least you get the full thing 
,modropplop,2009-04-03T03:19Z,"If you know your regedit feel free to do what I did, go to:
Current User->Software->NCH Software->Prism->Registration
Then I changed the Value of RD to its reverse (i.e. 1234 is changed to 4321) not sure if it will continue to work for free and not sure if it will work for you but sometimes you need to try for yourself."
,TorrentfilerAB,2010-03-07T11:36Z,This only works on Windows Vista!! I have Windows 7!!!
[T],bill_214,2010-04-04T06:47Z,"Thanks modropplop,

Your Regedit trick worked for me with both videopad and prism.

I don't know if it's a permanent fix or not but it works for now.


Just like the others, I downloaded this with the understanding it's freeware and because that's what the bastards said it was and if you do a search all the download locations still say it's free and nothing about it being a tral."
