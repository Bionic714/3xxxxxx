Webcam Surveyor is complete webcam software that combines video surveillance and video capture tools. With this software you can record all video activity, work as a motion detector, program alerts to be trigged by events (send a e-mail, upload images to FTP site, capture all motion activity in AVI video format). This makes it possible for you to observe remotely whatever activity your camera captures.

Program Features:

* Capture Video/Audio - Using sophisticated algorithms of video compression Webcam Surveyor can record videos with sound for a few hours. At the same time saving space on your hard drive.

* Capture Image Sequence - capture sequence of images with an interval of time of a second to 59 hours.

* Motion capture - you can record all motion activity in one AVI file. Instead of continuous record 24 hours per day, 7 days in week, the image can be recorded only when motion detected. This preserves disk space and excludes the expenditures of time for the survey of unnecessary images.

* Motion Detection - alert you immediately when activity is detected.
