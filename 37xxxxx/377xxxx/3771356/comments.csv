,Marckiepine,2012-02-27T20:12Z,"Bah, theres trojans and then theres Trojans, almost every keygen, cracked exe-files or custom ""credits""-files are detected as viruses by most antivirus software; But most of them are in fact quite harmless! I'd rather have 100 ""trojans"" in the form of keygens or whatever (less than 1mb a piece) than a ""real"" virus any day!"
