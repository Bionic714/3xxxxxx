,Kaleidoskopet,2007-08-12T23:45Z,"ignore my comment... everything is good..

PLZ SEED WHEN FINISHED!"
,Kaleidoskopet,2007-08-13T20:40Z,PLZ SEED! Dont be an ago! Share this fantastic music of trance!
,Kaleidoskopet,2007-08-26T11:22Z,"I'm sorry that I didnt know all the names.. I wasnt shure about them all so I just named them like I did :(

Yeah this is real stuff comparing to those crapy ""techno top"" some guys seeds :P"
,Ch!l!f00d,2007-08-26T12:42Z,"ur mainjack i dont consider this as ""good"" music is to classic .. top 100 ftw!"
,Kaleidoskopet,2007-08-30T15:54Z,This is real trance. Not some kind of music with a plingplong beat and a tiny girl voice singing some bad vocals.
,Sigh1,2007-09-02T10:24Z,Nice seeding goes freaking fast now.
,Kaleidoskopet,2007-09-04T22:22Z,"Vol. 2 Is on its way!  There are so many of these trance tracks that I want to put into this volume so its hard to choose out some of them...

Well I just hope you enjoy Vol.1 and also will enjoy Vol.2 ! :)

Vol.2 will have both old trance tracks and some really new... I actually put together the tracks as I listen to them so dont blame me for missing a classic trance track or something like that.. You can always write a comment on what track you would like to see in Best of Trance! :)"
,diepzeesnorkel,2007-09-26T11:17Z,"This is coming in the right direction but just too simple anyway's. Good work anythanks. I will seed always a week long with a 12-18 hour casual. 
Any has his own taste about music , you can respect their choice (then ur cool) or you can yell to them.
Then ur a selfish m*therF*UCKER... Each torrent is cool!! Altough i don't like any Trance/Techno/House, (whatever u wanne 
call it) what today is hot.
Does anyone has Trance from the year '1988 - '1995 ??
That would be great.
And if ya wanne yell...Go to prison and yell to the animals there :)

Be great and have fun in torrentworld!;)"

,diepzeesnorkel,2007-10-02T08:43Z,"Thanks but not what i'm looking for. Songs are ok but it has to be rave actually from early in the 90's But i did found what i lookin for only i have just the bad luck there are just one or two seeders wich aren't online so far. Well it would be great if i can seed it soon too.
