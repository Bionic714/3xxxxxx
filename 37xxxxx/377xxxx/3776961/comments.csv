,death734,2007-08-18T09:28Z,"any reason it says s03e00 instead of s03e01 this time if this one is a ""proper""?"
,sunnyphilly,2007-08-18T09:32Z,"It's ""Proper"" cause the first time I uploaded it, I fucked it up. Sorry.

As for the 3x00...it's cause this isn't 3x01 (check IMDB) and since I don't know which episode it is, I labeled it as 3x00...this way people won't confuse it once actual episodes (with ep numbers) once they come out."
,yourpcguy73,2007-09-02T23:38Z,ya this is a web rip
,irPuMa,2008-10-26T21:48Z,"Yea they aired this before season three started like you said.. during s3 though they ended up airing this episode as s03e10 ""Mac Is a Serial Killer"" on October 18, 2007, production number 1P03003.. just fyi."
