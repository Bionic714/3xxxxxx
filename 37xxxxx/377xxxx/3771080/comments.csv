Thanks once again.  "

,shadark,2008-02-12T15:35Z,"Hows the quality of the episodes?
I've downloaded all 7 seasons before, but a lot of the episodes are really crap quality.

Just wondering if the quality is better in this download, or if I shouldn't even bother?"
,soulredeemer,2008-02-19T13:56Z,thanks a lottttttt man
,LostBoyNZ,2008-02-21T10:38Z,"About 150mb per episode, hmm quality could go either way I guess. I've had the same problems with some episodes in the past. I'll try a few first and post back with the results."
,LostBoyNZ,2008-02-21T10:51Z,"Actually looking at the exact file sizes, these are the same as I already have. So seasons 1, 6 and 7 are great. Season 5 is pretty good. But 2, 3, 4 range from great to unwatchable. To give you some idea, some episodes are just 40mb !!!

Sadly I've had a really good look around online and it seems every torrent uses the same original files. Even the so called ""HDTVRip"" seasons here on Pirate Bay."
,BaaGGeeN,2008-03-01T14:49Z,eyy..can someone please seed :( ?..iw been stuck on 24.5 for weeks now..

,0scarf,2008-03-25T23:25Z,"thanks to who are already seeding but if you have it completed plleeasseeee seed, its too big for only a few to seed, torrents only work if every1 helps each other"
[V],cezen,2008-04-09T15:53Z,"I was going to download this torrent because after having talked to fox studios after prompting by netflix, it doesn't look like the other seasons are coming anytime soon.. their marketing strategy is to wait until the kids who were hooked on this show are old enough and making enough money to spent 60 bucks a season for it... so these torrents here are our only choice for a while... I have no doubt that someone somewhere has been patiently recording the episodes in REAL HDTV to upload for a torrent... So while I am thankful for the person who took the time to complie every episode of every season, I will wait.  I will wait the years that it seems I will have to wait to get ALL my years in high quality... that being said... if someone IS working on a REAL HDTV project for MITM all seasons... write me at yakimajoe@yahoo.com and I will be happy to send you some DVDS to record an exact copy and help seed or to offer emotional support...... thank you!"

,mollien,2008-07-17T03:54Z,"To add swesub in vlc you first click on open file and then you browse and fint the episode or movie you wanna watch, then you click on ""use subtitles file"" and then browse the subtitle file =)"
,cherryrosa,2008-07-21T13:40Z,"thanks cezan for the info. i'd also like to thank DeliXiosO for this great torrent and compiling all the episodes. out of the poorer quality episodes there really is only one that is totally unwatchable, that being 'flashback' in season 2 because the sound is out of sync with the video. there isn't any variation of the files on here, but if anyone does find all the episodes in HD or just in high quality then please post here and let the rest of us know... i think the days of file-sharing are coming to a close and it won't be long before we all start getting letters from our internet providers, so let's enjoy the last few months and share as much info as possible with each other."

,k9krunchees,2009-06-17T09:13Z,"Great to see the whole show compiled. This is the only compilation I could find on the internet. But you should know, the entire middle of the series is just awful quality, not even playable by most players. Frankly though, I watched through the pain because quality or not, it's all here, and it's still an excellent show. Nice work.

I will continue to seed this. And you should too. It took me several weeks to download this torrent."

,theluckynumber,2009-12-13T19:13Z,"instead of loading through a torrent, I just stream the episodes on Ninjavideo.net and save the divx files after they are done streaming. Quality is much better than most of the files in this torrent and it takes about 5 minutes for one episode. just my suggestion. I'm at the end of season 7 now and almost sad that it's over"

,zekeisaszekedoes,2011-06-23T23:18Z,"FOX are dicks.  This show has six of seven seasons not on DVD, and the one season that is on DVD is fucking non-widescreen when almost everyone now owns a widescreen CRT at least.

Just because the music rights are slightly too expensive the master reels sit gathering dust in a store room somewhere rather than generating profit for the network and making the fans happy.

It's not bad enough that FOX cancelled Firefly, Futurama (brought back, sucks now), Family Guy (bought back, dire from season 7 onwards), Drive and a bunch of other quality shows but they also engage in this kind of asshattery.

On the plus side, thanks to the upload and everyone seeding.  It's nice to see these episodes I enjoyed years ago again in some form."
