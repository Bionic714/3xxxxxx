Malcom in the Middle is a five-time Emmy, Grammy-winning and three time-nominated Golden Globe American situation comedy created by Linwood Boomer for the Fox Network.
The show starred Frankie Muniz as Malcolm, the third-oldest of four, later five, children in the family. The oldest child, Francis, was shipped off to military school, leaving the three boys: Reese, Malcolm, and Dewey living at home, Malcolm being the second oldest of the three (hence the title of the show). The situation centered on Malcolm and his dysfunctional family's life.
