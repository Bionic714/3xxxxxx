In a small village in Colombia, the pregnant seventeen years old Maria (Catalina Sandino Moreno)
supports her family with her salary working in a floriculture. She is fired and with a total lack
of perspective of finding a new job, she decides to accept the offer to work as a drug mule,
flying to USA with sixty-two pellets of cocaine in her stomach. Once in New York, things do not 
happen as planned.
