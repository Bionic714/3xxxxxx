,BrenJames,2007-08-15T01:48Z,"This is a great film, how can u upload it and make it a prob for d/l you prick"
,huntersthompson,2007-08-15T16:05Z,lmao @ prick..im a prick because you dont know how to use nero and burn the image file? or maybe open it with vlc player..you fucking moronic bastard   
,huntersthompson,2007-08-15T16:16Z,you burn this type of file to cd-r's not dvd's. i use nero 7. first i open nero express..then i go down to disk image or saved project option..i open up the folder that has the file in it i click it and it takes me to the burn process..thats it. use an 80 min. cd-r and set it to 84 min over burn. takes about 10 min if you use 8x speed. and will play in any dvd player that supports vcd format
,BrenJames,2007-08-15T16:59Z,"I apologise for my rude comments. Of course it is easy to burn when you know how!!
Thanks for the help."
,huntersthompson,2007-08-15T17:31Z,"no problem man just ask next time..oh and you can 
use isobuster to extract the mpegav file to a folder and you can burn it to dvd or watch it on media player but the picture isnt as clear..its intended for cd-r's.."
