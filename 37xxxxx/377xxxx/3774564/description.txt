This is the KCNcrew Pack August 15 issue 2007.  It\\\'s like Serial Box, which has SN\\\'s, cracks and patches.  It would be best to have both of these collections, as this Pack often has serials you cannot find in the SBox.
Unlike SBox, no readers are required.  Just open the dmg file, drag and drop the app where you like.
However, there is no way to view what serials, cracks and patches are new in this issue as compared to the previous.

Requirements:
G3, G4, G5 or Intel
OS X 10.3.9 or newer
