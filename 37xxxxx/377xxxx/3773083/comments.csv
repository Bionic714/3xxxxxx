,hansdegebruiker,2007-08-17T15:19Z,"dvd 2, 3 and 4 are nuked broken not working.
I treid everything but there seems to be a RAR part missing and it will not extract.
I also tried to load the dvd's in winmount but that didn't work either.
We have to wait on another release :(((("
,Thugangeldk,2007-08-17T15:20Z,"Hello! When I try to unrar these files it gives me the following error. This problem is present on all versions except DVD1!

What to do?

Do you have any fixes?

Don't tell me I downloaded 20GB of nothing? :-( Disk 1 is great though :-)!

PHOTOSHOP.TOP.SECRET.DVD.X-HELL\h-pstsX.r01: You need to start extraction from a previous volume to unpack pstsc.iso

PHOTOSHOP.TOP.SECRET.DVD.X-HELL\h-pstsX.r01: No files to extract

Starting with h-pstsX.r00 does not help either. I tried starting from each rar file and result is the same


Note: X stands for the disk number, for example: PHOTOSHOP.TOP.SECRET.DVD.X-HELL is PHOTOSHOP.TOP.SECRET.DVD.1-HELL"

,Kalima9,2007-08-17T16:26Z,Start Extraction from .Rar to get past errors.
,Thugangeldk,2007-08-17T19:59Z,"Kalima9, you are my hero! Thanks!

All other people, this is the solution:

Extract the file with RAR extension! Then it should work!!"
,hansdegebruiker,2007-08-17T20:38Z,tried to start from every file now but nothing happens :(

,_-P5YCH0-_,2007-08-19T09:36Z,"Heres the fix, ladies. (Works like a charm.)"
,_-P5YCH0-_,2007-08-19T09:38Z,"Having trouble linking the file from rapidshare. But heres an excerpt from the readme, most of you can figure it out from there I hope:


If you are having trouble extracting the files, then copy each of these batch files into their respective folders
h-psts2.bat -> DVD2
h-psts3.bat -> DVD3
h-psts4.bat -> DVD4

Then run the batch files.

The batch files include this command only: ren

it renames the files from 
h-psts#.rar -> h-psts#.part001.rar
h-psts#.r00 -> h-psts#.part002.rar
h-psts#.r01 -> h-psts#.part003.rar
(# = 2, 3, and 4 for DVD2, DVD3 and DVD4) 
Etc."

,Dentrosch,2007-08-19T15:51Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3778206

When you have trouble unraring the PHOTOSHOP.TOP.SECRET.DVD.X-HELL\h-pstsX.r01 files 
Just copy the bat file into folder where the .r01 files are and double click.
Then unrar and enjoy."
,Jewel1,2007-08-23T17:30Z,Hi I use a Mac and it expanded fine with stuffit expander. Unrar wouldn't work for me no matter what I tried.
,o Lucifer o,2007-08-28T14:34Z,"Someone told me to copy the bat-file, I cant find it :S"
,ManMachine,2007-08-28T16:23Z,"Lucifer:
