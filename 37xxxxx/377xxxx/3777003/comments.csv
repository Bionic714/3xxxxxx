,RocketSauce83,2007-10-04T01:57Z,"ok I got it here is how it works. IMPORTANT READ THIS WHOLE FAQ BEFORE ATTEMPTING!!!!

download this torrent then download ""powerISOV3.8 with keygen"" once you have gotten power ISO to work open the call of duty torrent into the power ISO program(by going to open, then go to the folder you downloaded this torrent into)once you open the ISO you will see a lot of folders and some other stuff just click on setup.exe and make sure to click on""extract files into temporary folder""(after extraction is complete) this will bring up the setup call of duty screen the first thing it will want is the CD key hold alt and hit tab to minimize installation screen then open up the deviance folder and go to the""key-gen"" folder and double click the .exe provided, this cleaver lil program will pop a box  up with a CD key on the bottom. copy this into the boxes on the install screen once key is in say ok, let game install up untill it needs second CD then hit cancel and say ""NO"" to deleting the half installed program (if you say yes you will have to start all over again). now go back to power ISO and open the deviance/crack folder the program we need in here is called codsp.exe drag and drop this into C:\programfiles\callofduty and this will replace the CODsP ""single player"" icon. ok one step left then your done now go back to your powerISO software and open cod CD 2 once open go to the setup/main/data folder and copy all the ""pak"" files into c:\programfiles\call of duty/main ok so now with all this done click on the CODsP icon located in c:\programfiles\call of duty and ta-da this should work if not sorry your hopeless cause this was quite a work around i to figure out"
,Azathoth23,2007-10-05T20:27Z,"I downloaded this earlier this week and it installs and runs perfectly.

It's a standard install for nearly all ISO's out there.

First of all dowload Daemon tools (it's free).

Start Daemon tools and mount the 1'st cd ISO.
If it starts to install press cancel then explore the CD and find the crack folder, run the keygen and write it down then go back and start the installation entering the key when asked, let it continue installing and when asked for cd2 simply unmount cd1 in Daemon tools and mount cd2 then press ok in the installation program then vice versa when asked again for cd1 (Rocketsauce's copying of files isn't necessary).

Finaly, once again explore cd1 go to the crack folder and copy the Cod.exe (or whatever it's called), go to where you've installed the game, which will be C:\Program Files\Call of Duty unless you chose to put it elsewhere, then paste the copied .exe letting it replace the .exe already there.

I couldn't really explain that any more simply and hope it helps anyone having trouble."
,-MurdeR-,2007-10-06T05:08Z,"can someone help me, i have the game installed and everything but when i try to join a game it says ""CD KEY ALREADY IN USE"" .. wtf plz help i wanna play"
,RocketSauce83,2007-10-06T06:27Z,there is no help for that you can either re-install the game under new CD keys till you find one that works or buy the game out right from the company but most of these key are generated of preexsisting ones these will allow you to play Single player but not multi sorry Charlie.
,RocketSauce83,2007-10-06T06:28Z,oh and plus you need to update to version 1.5 to play this online and you cant update a pirated video game unless you have a cracked 1.5 patch good luck
,RocketSauce83,2007-10-06T06:29Z,get steam at steampowered.com the game cost like 9.95 on there for 10 bucks cmon you can afford that

Cd-key in use.. As usual. What can i do? I want play online....."
,subytrek,2007-10-15T08:41Z,"Alright, I've finally gotten Single Player to work by a different method that doesn't require powerISO & Daemon Tools (although you should have it). You do the usual, burn the game onto your CD, etc. But when you finish that, you have to 

1. open a file (Start --> Run) around the lines of ""C:\Program Files/Call of Duty""
2. Now go to My Computer, right click on CoD, and click Explore. There should be several files and whatnot. Click Deviance, and then click Crack. There should be a file that says codsp.
3. Drag/copy codsp into the first folder I told you to open, and paste/drop it anywhere there.

Now the Single Player should work. If it still doesn't work, post a comment briefing me about your problem. I hope that helped you guys out!

,shawniboy69,2008-02-16T04:10Z,"Ok for all you noobs. This is the easiest game to install, compared to games like oblivion and diablo 2, all u do is download poweriso (u need that for pretty much every game u download) then run the poweriso virtual drive manger. Then at the bottom right (beside the msn icon ad ur clock) there should be a yellow disk there, right click the disk and go up to drive (whatever drive it is) and then click on mount. go to the folder where u downloaded call of duty (mine is in documents and downloads) and run disk 1. enter the cd key given (no u can not go online unless u have ur own unqiue cd key as only 1 key at a time can be online) then install when it ask for disk 2 go to the yellow disk again and unmount disk 1 then mount disk 2 and finish the install. Now when u start the game it says please insert disk 1, to fix this is by going to my computer c: program files and call of duty and delete CODSP.exe and go to the folder where u downloaded the game and put the crack provided that should be CODSP.exe in the call of duty folder in program files

,reefacheefa,2008-04-25T07:54Z,"heres how to play online multiplayer for free noobs
first, update ure game with the latest patches. then download a server browser program  called the all seeing eye.. get it here

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3614534/The.All.Seeing.Eye.v2.6.0.WinALL.Cracked-EMPORiO

next ure gonna need to import the call of duty cracked server list to the all seeing eye, heres the link for that

http://www.epcgaming.com/epcgaming_v2/servers.php?gameid=1

but youll need to register for a free acount at epcgaming.com to get that cracked server list imported into the all seeing eye. more detailed info on this final step is at the link.

,bojan13,2009-07-30T11:21Z,"Learn how to crack games plz i am tired of the same questions over and over again.In most torrents with game you get crack(the same icon as game .exe icon) just copy that to game .exe dir. and that is it.
Or for easier
1.find crack 
2.copy crack
3.with your right click on game shortcut and
go to properties
4.click find target...
5.paste crack
6.then on question ""do you want to overwtite ..."" click yes.
Game is now cracked.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

,static4real,2010-02-27T06:25Z,"NEVER MIND. I FIGURED IT OUT. great job xmen. to those wondering why single player isnt working. open up the downloads where u downloaded these iso's to ( most likely my documents/downloads ) and after u install the game, go to the downloads, open the cod 1 cd in 7zip or whatever you use to open archives. double click the "" deviance "" folder. double click the ""crack "" folder. drag that crack to your desktop. now right click and copy the one on your desktop. now go to my computer. go to the c\: drive. double click program file, double click call of duty, now right click somewhere in a blank area and right click. now click paste. for vista users, select copy and replace. for xp just select yes to replace it. works great thanks. hope this helped. took me a bit to figure out"
,advarcher,2010-03-13T08:14Z,"yeah...so I followed Rocketsauce's instructions on how to start the game up. Everything went ok until i tried to start a new game. I click it, then it asks me the difficulty. I click normal then the box closes and nothing happens...
Anyone know the problem?

I checked the console and it said it was missing map training.bsp
Is it because it was on a seperate disk or something?

Boy, you haven't been using torrent's very long have you?. Because of the way a keygen/crack work's, most, if not ALL, anti virus program's MISTAKE it as a trojan. As for the guy below that comment, if you getting pop up's, it's because of YOUR lack of caution while online.

Now Add file and double click the CD2, mount it like you mounted the CD1. Now when it says the ''Run .exe'' etc, just exit it, don't press any of those buttons. Go back to the installation and continue installing. When it's done installing it will ask you to insert CD1 again, do the same but this time mount CD1 again and go back to installation and continue."
