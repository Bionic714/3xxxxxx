,RottenIntelligence,2008-01-03T19:07Z,"It took me like a week and a half to get this due to the low seeds but it works perfectly, and I've NEVER seen Tomba anywhere else. I'm going to continue to seed this for everyone. I can't leave it on all the time due to the fact it slows down my connection so I can't play wow. However if you are downloading it and need more seeders, please just send a message my way and I'll get it up. This really is a great package, easy no hassle. It needs some massive seeds it's great :)"
