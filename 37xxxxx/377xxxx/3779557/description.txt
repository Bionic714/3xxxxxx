Grand Prix is a band that only managed to release three albums. They released their first homonymous album in 1980. Then after two years they released Ã?Â¢??There For None To SeeÃ?Â¢?? and in 1983 was their time with Ã?Â¢??SamuraiÃ?Â¢??. Ã?Â¢??SamuraiÃ?Â¢?? is the best work of the band, although after that album they split up. 

Grand Prix, for those who might not know them, are playing melodic rock/AOR music with some hard rock elements from song to song. And believe me that they know not only what they play but they also know how to play it!

Ã?Â¢??SamuraiÃ?Â¢?? damned to be the last and the best album of the band. In this album they chime in the best elements from the AOR genre and also their best ideas with their good way of playing. The songs are not as heavy as you might think but they all have beautiful choruses and strong vocal melodies. Moreover thatÃ?Â¢??s the thing that made Ã?Â¢??SamuraiÃ?Â¢?? a very good melodic album. Just listen to songs like Ã?Â¢??50-50Ã?Â¢??, Ã?Â¢??Here We Go AgainÃ?Â¢??, Ã?Â¢??Freedom You CryÃ?Â¢??, Ã?Â¢??Somewhere TonightÃ?Â¢??, Ã?Â¢??High TimeÃ?Â¢??, and the lyrical Ã?Â¢??SamuraiÃ?Â¢?? to Ã?Â¢??seeÃ?Â¢?? how good Grand Prix was. Also the production is good for the period that the album was released.

Grand Prix, although they were a good band they disappeared from the music scene. But Ã?Â¢??SamuraiÃ?Â¢?? is still there and it continues to remind us of a band that sunk in the music industryÃ?Â¢??s bullshits!
