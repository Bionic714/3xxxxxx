,fakterr,2009-02-20T05:19Z,"Hey man thanks for the upload! works great! 100% clean of virus's

for the people who cant install, go into razor 1911 and open the keygen, enter your name and the keygen into the setup. once setup is complete move the 2 given warcraft exe (play one, and map editor) into the warcraft programme folder in your hard drive. then you can play."
