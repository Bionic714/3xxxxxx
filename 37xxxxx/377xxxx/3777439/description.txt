Since the release of the Doom source code for the computer games, programmers have created feature-enhanced versions of the computer Doom game in their own source ports. Several fans of Doom 64 decided to work to convert the game's exclusive content to the computer using jDoom, generally considered the most advanced of the source ports in graphics. The add-on, titled "Doom 64: Absolution" is available for download and features the new graphics and maps of the Nintendo 64 game. It is a near-perfect re-creation of Doom 64, with new, original content, and an incomplete, discontinued expansion, "The Outcast Levels". Not everything is the same, however. For example, the Unmaker fires, in the PC version, little orange pulses. In the Nintendo 64 original, it fires actual red laserbeams that can pierce enemies. This mod appeals to many fans as a way to enjoy Doom 64 without emulation.
