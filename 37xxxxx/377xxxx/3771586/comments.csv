,Baloo2,2007-08-13T13:04Z,"I have some problems with my internet connection, so I will not be able to seed with more than a few kb/s the first couple of days. I still wanted to upload this so I don't forget about it...  :)

And even then I still only have a lousy ADSL connection, so it'll probably take a week or so for the first ones to complete the D/L, so please guys, keep seeding after you've got it! At least to a ratio of 1.0.

,Joey-girl,2007-08-21T21:54Z,"Hi Baloo2
This is my first time trying to download stuf like this and I'am having trouble watching it... Could you maybe guide me through how to make it work on my computer (have a Gibbs-like temper so not much patience:-). Hope you might be able to help me...
Big hug from Joey-girl"
,Baloo2,2007-08-21T22:38Z,"OK guys, I've now uploaded more than 1.0 of this one, and still nobody is closer to a full download than just over 50%.

Now's the time for extreme measures, this is when I kick and ban all those clients that do not understand the basics of the bittorrent idea.

From now on, until this torrent has completed, I will Kick & Ban every other client than those that follow the protocol all the way.

I have only something like 25kB/s upload to offer, I cannot waste that bandwidth on brain-dead clients that do not follow the protocol.

"
,Baloo2,2007-08-22T19:37Z,"Joey-girl, have you completed any of the files yet? If so, you should be able to just double click on the AVI file. Almost all modern OS:s are set up to automatically show AVI files with the proper program.

If that doesn't work for you, you must supply me with more information. Better yet, read the FAQ that should be around here somewhere."
,Joey-girl,2007-09-04T16:14Z,"Hi again.
Okay I got it to work and am now enjoying watching the NCIS-team at work. 
Hugs, Joey"
,angelustatoo,2007-09-08T16:49Z,"Hi All.. How soon can someone here tell me something.. All these torrents say ""with English subtitles"".. Doeas that mean the spoken language is Not English. Please state the original recorded Language. Is it Enlglish.. If so then its a bit confusing.."

,angelustatoo,2007-09-11T13:53Z,"Thanks c-file.. Glad to know that.. Been downloading with computer on 24-7 and was afraid the end result would be Swedish. LOL... Another question and I'm sorry but torrents are new to me.. A lot of the other season downloads are just the avi files.. this download has  alot of other files attached. To what purpose are they there? And how will these file work.. I seen many times from this torrent that someone is asking...""how do I watch these "" No one is answering.. Basically I 'Author' DVD's for a living and would only need Avi's so what is the rest for .. Please excuse my ignorance.. Also.. torents are sharing.. I seen a lot of people downloading then soon as they hav 100% they disappear.. CDomeon ppl .. keep seeding!!!! :-D"
,Vagemark,2007-09-13T00:13Z,"he baloo, i could help out... have a T3 connection & really want NCIS, so U all give it 2 me, and I'll seed   (I don't normally do that) my 100Mbit upload 4 a week..."

,LovelyLorry,2007-10-13T19:17Z,Really looking forward to this...:) Thanks
,darkvineyard,2007-11-15T23:16Z,"I'm going to download this as soon as I finish downloading the other seasons, but if someone can tell me how to share this file, so I don't leech it, I would love to know."
,Splitz3,2007-12-24T15:52Z,"Could someone please seed?
Acceptable speed now (200kbit/s) but I need it very fast.

Love NCIS!"

,RickyTheFish,2009-12-02T23:57Z,"The video quality is definitely good, but I recommend anyone who downloads to skip the English subs. The subtitles for the episode I have watched (Episode 12, ""Suspicion"") were 90% incomplete, and the subtitles that did exist were poorly spelled and had many, many errors.

Just get the videos and skip the subtitles, as they do nothing other than hinder the quality of the files."
