Super Taboo is a popular and sexually explicit Japanese manga about incest fantasy, by Wolf Ogami (OGAMI Oukami "Worshipping Wolf").

The manga is about a high school student Yuu who, raised separately, is reunited with his mother, Misako, and his sister, Eri, who both become infatuated with him. When Yuu becomes sexually aroused his inner demons take over and he is unable to control his actions, and the women in his family, his English teacher from America, and a female neighbor (who is later revealed to be the boy's aunt), are quick to take advantage of this.
