Shame on you for uploading such a pile of unviewable crap. Whoever it was that gave this the 2 plusses for quality either didnt watch it or has no idea of what quality is"

,fckityfck,2010-07-11T08:17Z,Thank you. A4/V3. Audio and video are fuzzy more often than not. Looks like a poorly put together fan made gag reel. Possibly tolerable for personal viewing for others. 11 July 2010.
