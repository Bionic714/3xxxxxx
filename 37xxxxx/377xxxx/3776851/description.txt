Ali G is the leader of Da West Staines Massiv, a fictional gang composed of a group of wannabe gangstas from Staines (a small, affluent, suburban town to the west of London); their chief rivals are Da East Staines Massiv. After he goes on a hunger strike and is spotted chained to some railings by the nefarious Deputy Prime minister David Carlton (played by Charles Dance), he is drawn into a world of seedy political intrigue, as the Chancellor tries to use Ali as a tool to destroy the Prime Minister's credibility.
