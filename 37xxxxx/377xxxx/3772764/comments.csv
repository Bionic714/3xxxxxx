,SmoothDrRod,2007-12-29T01:29Z,"Fuckin' A.  Works great.  If you ever come u'stateside let me know and I'll buy.  

This program is the newest in a good line of easy to use, easier to tweak rippers.  I bought version 3 legit but since my hardware upgrade it no longer seems to want to open more than once per installation.  

This particular package works and you can't really beat it.  Be responsible and once you have the money, spring for the code you use.  No one will continue devolpment unless you support ....  that goes for most things on thepb.  Download everything of interest.  Weed out the ignoble crap.  Ultimately support your artist (code monkey or otherwise)"
