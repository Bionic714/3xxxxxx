,STBtorrent,2007-10-13T23:14Z,"64k is good enough. The quality of the sound is limited by the original, tape. A voice (not music) can be reduced to 48k or even 34k with almost no noticable distortion. "
,etd,2007-11-20T07:33Z,First mp3 of book 4 is consistently corrupt for me. Downloaded 3 or 4 times. All others fine.

bad files -- repaired with MP3RepairTool.exe and now they work fine."
,notrelevant,2008-01-04T08:38Z,"One problem, Book 4 (Foundations Edge), Chapter 15 and 16 are identical. I have listened to them and chapter 16 is a copy of chapter 15, while the real chapter 16 is missing. Otherwise everything is fine and THANKS VERY MUCH for the upload."

,Infinity666,2008-03-24T12:58Z,"Thanx for this! I love it!
But...
Book 6 - Prelude to Foundation lacks the last part"
,ghstrdr03,2008-05-09T04:22Z,Agree with Infinity Prelude is missing some audio to finish the book.  Anyone have an idea to a complete Prelude file?  Other than that great files.  Another note these books are not the complete foundation line of stories.  Check this Wiki article  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series and scroll to list of books.
,Mesoscope,2008-05-16T14:20Z,The last part of Prelude To Foundation is indeed missing. I didn't find it on TPB so I opened an extra torrent for it: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4190828
,Mesoscope,2008-05-20T17:55Z,"Since the 16th part of ""Foundation's Edge"" is just a copy of the 15th part, i seeded the real one as well, enjoy! :
