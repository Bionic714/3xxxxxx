Overview:	Jet Li returns to his most famous role - and reunites with director Tsui Hark - as the legendary Wong Fei Hung in Once Upon a Time in China and America, the sixth installment in the OUATIC series. This adventure begins in the old west, with Fei Hung, along with his fiancee Aunt Yee (Rosamund Kwan) and his student Seven (Hung Yan Yan) travelling by stagecoach to visit his former disciples Po Chi Lam and Bucktooth Sol, who have set up a medical practice in America. They are attacked by Indians, and in the ensuing melee Fei Hung falls into a river. He loses his memory, and is adopted by the Indian tribe, who give him the name "Yellow." Meanwhile, the racist mayor of the local town hires a gang of vicious bandits to rob the town's bank so that he can pay off his loans. When Yee finally finds Fei Hung, it's up to Seven to restore his memory, which he does by re-staging Wong's greatest battles from the previous OUATIC films. Even then, their troubles are not over, for Fei Hung is framed by the mayor for the bank robbery, forcing him to bring the real villains to justice.
