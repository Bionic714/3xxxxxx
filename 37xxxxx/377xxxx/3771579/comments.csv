but my question is even if you install it you have to activate it and there is no keygen is there?

so if you cant activate it u can only use it for a limited amout of time untill you cant log on anymore...

,Jeordie,2007-09-16T08:37Z,"This is a good download, but I don't think this is right for you guys who posted. Sorry, you just seem too incapable managing simple things. Look for something called antiwpa to activate this. 
http://maghia.free.fr/Board/ that might give you a start.

Secondly, media center is fully capable of running all programs, don't for applications that mention it. Thats just idiotic. Media Center has the same kernel and is almost identical to windows xp pro, but just with added features of well media center. It kind of became the new xp pro for desktops, as it was just an interim release till vista was released."
,TKM625,2007-10-05T18:17Z,"Jeordie, I think they're trying to say that this isn't actually Media Center Edition, it's Professional Edition, which leaves out a lot of the features that Media Center came with. Other than that, you're right, they're nearly identical."

.... o...k..... i havent downloaded this but thats besides the point... so u never heard of a rar file... ok, u r retarded??? or just a n00b... search TPB for ""WINRAR"" a tool for creating and extracting the rar file extention, a VERY COMMON FILE COMPRESSION FILE EXTENTION... i mean like half the files on TPB are rar files..... is that is one of the most stupidest questions i have heard here at TPB... 

then again there have been worst questions... like those who dont know how the **** to download the files on TPB cause they dont know wtf a torrent is....


anyhow... to install this u would have to get winrar, extract this file and (assuming that the extracted file is a disk image) burn the image to a CD or DVD depending on how big the image is supposed to be... then start the computer with it or something like that..... since i havent downloaded this i dont realy know what is in the rar file, nor how to install it.... so......
