,NeverTheSame,2007-08-24T00:30Z,"Awesome dude! Glad it made you happy. Apparently they're gonna be releasing a 5 CD box set in the next month or two of the Complete Recording sessions that led to this record.

This is, hands down, my favorite Miles record from the Fusion era, possibly my favorite of all."

,ceddieboy,2007-12-15T18:44Z,"First, Awesome torrent!  Love the CD and info!

But why the hating on joint stereo? It has no barring on the sound its just a more smarter compression scheme. I always use JS with VBR set to min and max when I am doing lossy compression.

If you really wish to impress try offering a lossless encode, preferably FLAC, next time!

,NeverTheSame,2008-02-28T01:44Z,"Summarized from Wikipedia: 

""There are two kinds of joint stereo:

Intensity stereo coding uses a technique known as joint frequency encoding, which functions on the principle of sound localization. Human hearing is predominantly less acute at perceiving the direction of certain audio frequencies. By exploiting this 'limitation', intensity stereo coding can reduce the data rate of an audio stream with little or no perceived change in apparent quality.

M/S stereo coding transforms the left and right channels into a mid channel and a side channel, hence the name. The mid channel is the sum of the left and right channels, or L + R. The side channel is the difference of the left and right channels, i.e., L ? R.""

In both cases, it is modifying the original stereo image to something new. I prefer to hear the record the way the artists/producers intended."
