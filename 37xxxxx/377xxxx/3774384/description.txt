After the disappointing sales of Twenty 1, keyboardist Robert Lamm indicated that the band felt it would be best to succeed or fail on its own merits. Produced by Peter Wolf (keyboardist to Zappa's Mothers) and set for release in March of 1994, Stone was to mark the return to the adventurous and experimental sound the band had established in their glory years of the early 1970s, with a modern refurbishing. 

It was meant to be a drastic departure from the familiar power-ballad mode the group had become locked into.

Warner Bros. Records, Chicago's record company at the time, was displeased with the album, and thus dismissed Sisyphus as being "unreleasable." This led to an acrimonious split with the band. Tracks from the unreleased album have surfaced on bootleg recordings, and even through the Internet. The band seems to have done nothing to stop this, and many of the songs have since appeared on legitimate compilations as well.

Enjoy.
