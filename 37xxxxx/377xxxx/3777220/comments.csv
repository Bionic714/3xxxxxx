,kyllopardiun,2011-04-13T23:16Z,"To anyone who get the sound problem on 7/vista:

This is what you should do->
Download the plugins at
http://www.esnips.com/web/mugensoundfix

and the config part2

1. you just have to move the plugins to the folder plugin in the mugen directory

then you must replace the mugen.cfg text in the torrent between 

; Sound configuration (Windows)
...
;-------------------------------------------------------
[Misc]
for the one in the cfg from the file you dowloaded...

enjoy!"

,jlemieuxjr,2012-07-03T17:33Z,"no sound and tails and raiden and a bunch of chars dont work. Otherwise works fine lol. I went to the site that guy gave to fix the sound and its just a bunch of bullshit , no direct download link, and tried to make you download something in order to download the file. BULLSHIT PUT THE SOUND FIX ON TPB"
,NTA-Pro,2012-07-06T16:16Z,"I successfully got it working on windows 7. I have no idea hoq but I was able to get the files from esnips. In the first download, you put the files from the zip file into the plugin folder. For the cfg file, you copy the text starting at ; Sound configuration (Windows) all the way to the ;-------------------------------------------------------
[Misc]

and then you replace that same part in cfg file from your mugen. I could make a video if anyone needs some help."
