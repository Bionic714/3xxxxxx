         PhotoWatermark Professional is the most powerful digital photo
         watermarking tool that combines simplicity and efficiency and
          simplifies the process of creating and applying watermark to
         multiple files. It uses a mixture of text, graphic and drawing
          watermark of any complexity. Various fill styles alow you to
       create good looking text and shape objects. The automatic objects
        can extract various EXIF data from your images. The multi-level
          transparency settings allow you to choose how your watermark
        objects will affect your pictures. It supports JPEG, TIFF (inc.
           multi-image TIFF), BMP, GIF (inc. animated gif), PNG, and
       JPEG2000. The built-in watermark manager helps you manage multiple
         watermark files and easily switch. Its batch features include
         combinations of watermarking, converting, resizing, renaming,
          cropping, rotating, fine-tuning and printing. A built-in FTP
        client lets you upload and download your photos directly to and
       from your server. A 4-step watermark wizard will help your start.
