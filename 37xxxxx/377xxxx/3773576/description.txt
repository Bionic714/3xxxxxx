[GENERAL]
Tougeki - Super Battle Opera (?? Tougeki?, lit. fighting play), also known as 
Arcadia Cup, is an annual Japanese fighting video game tournament hosted by the

[NOTES]
Most breaks/intermissions are cut down to relevant stuff like interviews.
30 minutes in thirdstrike-final-division-32-to-8 got lost due to connetion 
problems resulting in a currupted stream. Everything else is complete as far 
as i can remember. 


Have fun. subarashii
