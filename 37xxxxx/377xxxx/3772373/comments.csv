HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE then press on the + by SOFTWARE then press on the + by Argonaut Software. Then you see croc.. click on this.

Now look at Directory.. If this is diffrent then were you have installed croc.. then change..

if thats done it should work.

!! if you can't see this.. then use this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4339964"

Yes there is music, But you will need to convert the DAA to a less propriety format and burn the image file to a disc with imgburn or something."
