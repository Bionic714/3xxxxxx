,gompedyre,2007-09-05T17:59Z,"I reckon it's RCT 1 you mean. What do you mean complete?

Is it with both expansions? Are they separate, or have you made one big unattended install? The patch, is it a working drexler patch or something else?"
,screagles,2007-09-06T19:32Z,"ok, the first ISO is the original roller coaster tycoon. no expansions. the second iso is the corkscrew follies and loopy landscapes expansion. the patch was downloaded off of fileplanet, and it is a offical RCT release patch."

,screagles,2008-04-12T17:14Z,"im not sure how everyone is having issues, but it has worked for me and my other comps so idk. "
,didomusicuk,2008-08-16T17:06Z,Roller Coaster Tycoon (the original) does not work fully on Windows Vista due to the ramped-up security. Anyone who says otherwise is a fucking tool.
,Rathyas,2009-07-11T02:04Z,"Oh, wow.
Nice Torrent.
Thanks a lot, screagles.
