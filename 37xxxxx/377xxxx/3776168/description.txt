Overview:	Jet Li stars in Once Upon A Time In China (OUATIC) as Chinese folk hero Wong Fei Hung in a modern, politically-oriented retelling of the legend. Set in the 19th century, China is in the process of being overrun and divided up by foreign colonial powers. Western ideas and influences are slowly infiltrating the East, while many of the Chinese flock to the west in pursuit of gold. Wong Fei Hung, a doctor, herbalist, and kung-fu master tries to mediate between the various factions. This earns him the emnity of various forces, including foreign imperialists, collaborating Chinese authorities, extortionist thugs, and a rival martial arts master. This eventually leads to a gravity-defying showdown in a ladder factory that has gone down as one of Jet Li's greatest fights ever.
