,hopplapony,2007-08-17T14:43Z,Great art-film from the seventies!
,KingJoeHouses,2008-02-06T00:01Z,"Lord_Terabyte, you have the best stuff uploaded. You're like the one guy at the video store whose ""employee's picks"" are consistently good."
,asdasd123123,2008-03-22T00:19Z,"This guy is by far the sickest dude ever. -_-
No other gore or thriller has anything on this movie."
,raheesen,2008-09-02T20:05Z,good quality...interesting movie...thanks...
,Heresiarch,2008-12-04T22:01Z,"the sound lags like shit with VLC, any tips?"
,DroppinLoads,2009-01-05T16:14Z,"If the sound is off, the latest version of VLC lets you adjust the sound forward or back. Click ""show extended settings"" then the synchro tab."
,bullthorn,2009-01-12T01:01Z,"""Thank you"", to the uploader.  The movie's sound is problematic in VLC, but the file plays flawlessly in WMP.  A worthwhile torrent."
[V],rambam1776,2009-07-15T03:52Z,"I hope all will pardon me (I do not ordinarily do this) but this film is part of a documentary on cult classics and midnight movies, and I have linked to this torrent in my description. I figured if anyone enjoyed THIS film, they might want to try the documentary.

,oblipet,2010-01-08T17:29Z,"WHY THE HELL ARE THERE SO MANY SEEDERS IF THE AUDIO IS FUCKED ???

I DLED IT TOO AND I CONFIRM: AUDIO IS FUCKED.

,harigata,2010-02-06T10:06Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT!!!!
Sound is totally fucked up!

Download this instead:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4408197/Eraserhead.RevisitedCollection_-_AliaIactaEst

I see that 5 people have given this movie a ""+"".
Who are those fucking morons?
fleetkid - you must be one of them.

Have all of you just neglected to notice that the sound is totally fucked in this rip? That giving the sound 0/10 would be too much?

A: Totally fucked/10
V: 8/10
Movie: definitely a must-watch"
[T],Arrrrrrrrrr,2010-02-20T07:38Z,Sound indeed fucked. Latest VLC.
,drjones_,2010-06-01T06:24Z,When I download I get a red downloading icon rather than a blue one.  I can't find what the red icon means -- does anyone know?
,jrallah,2010-06-05T14:04Z,"Yeah, noble effort, dude.  But the audio does really  seem to be fucked on this upload...

...at least for me in VLC."
,BoxMac,2010-07-02T14:52Z,"I'm with oblipet ....
Why so many seeders WITH NO SOUND ?!?
And this ISN'T a flame or whatever ....

I was sooooo  happy 'cause the download's quick -- like 5 minutes!  lol

Then I play it & all I get is silence.
I think: ""Oh, I guess I must've hit mute or something by mistake.""
So I check but everything's on.
STILL NO SOUND.

Then I try 2 other players -- which I shouldn't hafta do.
STILL NO SOUND.

The video?
10/10.
But THERE IS NO SOUND.

Avoid this torrent like an AIDS needle & try another one.

Booooooooo! Lord TeraByte !!

,Kiweed,2010-10-26T00:48Z,"All you people saying bitch bitch bitch about the sound, if you read the comments you would see that people say it has bad sound in vlc, but someone says it works in wmp so try that instead of bitching so much! BTW being abusive is just showing everyone how big an ignoranus YOU are so keep it to yourself ffs! cheers 4 da upload :)"
[V],protoyu,2011-02-19T18:46Z,The dickshittin' idiots who are complaining about the sound just start Virtual Dub Mod Go to streams>stream list>select full processing mode>compression>MPEG layer 3>128kbps.Then save AVI file in direct stream mode.THEN ENJOY THE MASTERPIECE OR FUCK OFF SKULLFUCKERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,alzi,2011-03-09T10:12Z,"In case someone's still wondering about the audio-problems.  The current version of VLC (1.17) has no problems whatsoever. 
Thanks for this piece of movie history."
,HalfaGuju,2011-05-21T01:40Z,"sound is fucked up in vlc 1.1.9 and wmp, works fine in media player classic. "
,MoviesR101,2012-01-25T09:28Z,"Thanks!

,tumbarrancho,2012-02-16T03:49Z,"Thank you Lord. I didn't know this movie, I'm gonna have a ball."
