,oobum,2008-05-31T17:36Z,Irritating with incorrect naming of the files.
,torrentsarelove,2008-06-22T02:18Z,Awesome
,Mysticum81,2008-08-07T21:02Z,It only has the worthless rerecording of Stormbl책st. Pity. The original is one of the best albums ever. The new version is run-of-the-mill shit.
,Mysticum81,2008-08-28T15:55Z,"Why would you call this a discography when their best album, Stormbl책st, is missing? All you've included is the shitty re-recording."
,XxDeucexX,2008-12-17T21:33Z,"I usually listen to rap music, lol.  I love these guys though! they actually mix melody with the sound of death and It is awesome!!!

Rock on!  \m/"
