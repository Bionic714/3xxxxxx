User Rating: 6.4/10


Henry (Harrison Ford) is a wealthy and successful lawyer whose life with his 
wife (Annette Bening) and daughter seem perfect, but in reality, Henry is 
cold-hearted and bitter. But all that changes when he's shot in the head during 
a robbery and must endure a slow and grueling recovery. As he relearns even the 
most basic of tasks such as walking and tying his shoes, a loving, caring man 
appears, much to the shock of his family and friends.
