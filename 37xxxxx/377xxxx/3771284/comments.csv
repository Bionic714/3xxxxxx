,Xcenius_1337,2007-09-02T21:55Z,thx u!! u are the best!! i love Star Wars
,Gastromix,2007-09-08T13:50Z,Or you could just chose to download the movie you want you can probably chose in your torrent program when you start the download.
,bama19642,2007-09-24T10:52Z," Download uTorrent, its much faster than Opera. I dont know how to prevent Opera from trying to dl the torrents automatically, but if you right-click the ""dl this torrent"" then choose copy link addy you can then click on the earth icon in the upper left corner of uTorrent and choose ok to add the file addy, then check the box next to the particular files you want. Anything is fater than Opera in my experience, and uTorrent uses fewer resources than most, if not all, clients."
,jeiroq,2007-10-03T19:05Z,"To get Opera to not DL automatically (it's stubborn), you have to go to Tools>Preferences>Advanced Tab

Then on the left click on Downloads and uncheck the mark up at the top that says ""Hide file types opened by Opera"" and scroll down to .torrent files. Then click ""Edit"" and select ""Open with default program"". 

Took me a while to figure it out on my own and I was tired of using Firefox for Torrents and Opera for everything else. "

,Supreme.Laks,2007-11-21T23:52Z,"My experience is also that the Opera BitTorrent Client is reeeaaaaally slow.
To prevent Opera from opening torrent files automatically, do the following:
Tools > Preferences... > Advanced tab > Downloads > Quick find: torrent (and be sure, that the ""Hide file types opened with Opera""-checkbox is not checked!) > select ""application/x-bittorrent"" > Edit... > And then change it to what you want.
May the force be with you. :-)"
