,ranodmgc,2007-10-02T00:08Z,When I try to install it still wants a serial. I extracted the disc image and burned it to a DVD. I don't know what to do with the rest of the files. Is there someone willing to help with this one?
,DonMaJic,2008-01-26T14:30Z,"Works like a charm, thanks for sharing!"
,DonMaJic,2008-01-26T14:35Z,"mat7 - open r00 with Extractnow or similar program that can unpack rar's, the rest will unpack automatically. 

punkstar69 - Sounds like you might not have a 64 bit computer, find out!

ranodmgc - I have no idea why its asking for a serial, maybe the image is corrupt or something, but I can't say for sure."
