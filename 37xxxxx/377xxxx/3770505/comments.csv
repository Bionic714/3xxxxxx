,Wai,2007-08-15T23:25Z,"Yes, fifth torrent of this game and still no result..
Last one I tried froze to 64%
This one hasn't even started, and I'm already frustrated. Uploaders don't care if leechers get nothing?
Nah, just whining.. Keep this up more than 3 days, eh?

,didgy,2007-11-26T14:54Z,if the file is damegd it means that you have to download it again like what happened to me when i downloaded warcraft III and you just have to extract one of the isos cuz theyre all tyhe same and then you need to open it with winrar or mount it with daemon toolz but if u opened it with the winrar then you gotta find a crack. srry for my bad eng.

,monkiesatemybaby,2007-12-27T01:13Z,"It was my fault... The first time I extracted it, something must have gone wrong. I deleted the damaged iso and re-extracted it and it works perfectly now. Great release, great game!"
,Brootje,2007-12-28T23:37Z,"I've succesfully downloaded the game, seeding as I type, and thus far It's working fine, I'm installing it right now, Crack is included. Also, this is not an .ISO File, but if you try to extract it and then install it will ask for a CD. So ill try to put it on a CD and ill tell u more.


Oh btw, DONT try to register with EA... If you hadn't figured that out yet, just DONT. I didn't try but im sure you'd get banned."
,Brootje,2007-12-29T09:54Z,"Ok, everyone, it works perfectly, when you have the file extract it, then install it. When installed with the keygen (in the 'Crack' folder) you must put the game.dat file from the Crack folder into the map where you installed LOTR BFME II. :) Have fun"

READ:

http://forums.ea.com/mboards/thread.jspa?threadID=275358&tstart=0

It works for the first battle of middle earth, the Second and third. 
When you make the file, be first to load the game you wanna play, and if fails, then do it, cause then the folder will pop up in Application Data called, My Lord of the RIngs Battle for Middle Earth File, and then you put it in.  you gotta do this for the battle for middle earth II and expansion, start the game first, get the error, and you can find that file.
