To commemorate the 30th anniversary of her father\'s death, Lisa Marie Presley not only decided to sing, but to sing with him. \"I wanted to use this for something good,\" she tells Spinner of her posthumous \'In the Ghetto\' duet with Elvis Presley. \"All fingers pointed towards New Orleans.\" She filmed the video in the hurricane-ravaged city, and all proceeds from the video and single will benefit a new Presley Place transitional housing campus there.
