,cormaczoso,2012-08-19T07:13Z,"anyone have the trekkies documentary from public television in the mid 1980s? it profiled four or five trekkies ... it wasn't the fawning bs of this one (no offense to the upper of course, just stating that's what this documentary is) ... i watched it and a documentary on some equally obsessed elvis fans ... two of the scariest documentaries i've ever seen ... if anyone has them or can steer me toward them would appreciate it :)"
