:. About .:

If you've never played any Ratbag games and 
are looking for a solid racer with an unusual subject, 
Dirt Track Racing 2 is well worth trying out.

In Dirt Track Racing 2, you'll find something like a cross between 
rally racing and NASCAR racing. Like in NASCAR races, you'll race 
on closed, purpose-built tracks. Here, most of the 14 tracks are oval 
variants with a few particularly dangerous figure-eight tracks thrown 
in for good measure. True to the game's name, you'll be racing across
bumpy dirt surfaces, often wet ones, regularly sliding through the corners
like a seasoned rally racer.
