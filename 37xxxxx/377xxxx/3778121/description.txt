     Mike Oldfield - 10th Anniversary of Tubular Bells 1983
---------------------------------------------------------------------

General Info.........: Recorded live on July 22nd 1983 at Wembley Arena, London.

"The set opened with Woodhenge going into a medley starting with Incantations part 3 opening, faithful version of Tubular Bells, and Crises (the enormous tower lighting up, the laser flashing all over the arena from the top and the HUGE moon rising over the tower during the drum build up to the climax!) in second half, Mount Teide, Moonlight Shadow and Shadow on the Wall. Footage was shot but was not deemed good enough for commercial release. There were four gigantic speaker towers in each corner. One reviewer, Mark Steels, said, "As a spectacle .. only marginally more exciting than watching a bus queue .. but this quite anonymous performer let the music do the talking for him instilling .. impressive freshness."  - www.Mikeoldfield.org
