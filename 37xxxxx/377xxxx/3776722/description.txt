And we think that cell phones and email and the Internet will help us find the key to that fairy-tale myth of happily-ever-after that sustains our culture. Instead, we lose authentic connection. Elizabeth Johnson shows you just how essential authentic relationships are to your quality of life and the steps you should take to reconnect.

-LEGAL TORRENTS

Purpose:

create a balance, share the already free stuff,
public domain works, freeware, free music,
free ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.

show the copyright owners that torrent
websites shouldn't bear the responsibility
of what their users upload, torrent websites
are very much similar to google..

users upload what they want to upload,
download what they want to download,
and search for what they want to search..

by creating this balance and sharing the already free
stuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..
