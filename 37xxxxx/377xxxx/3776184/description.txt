Plot:	When terrorists take over a luxury hotel, an ex-cop-turned-stuntman-and-bodyguard must protect a cowardly, prima-donna action star and rescue the hostages from a criminal mastermind who caused the death of his family years before.

Overview:	High Risk stars Jet Li as Kit (a.k.a. "Bold"), an army officer who fails to save his wife and child from being blown up by the criminal blackmailer "Doctor." He now works as the bodyguard and secret stunt double for Frankie (Jacky Cheung), a Hong Kong superstar known for his martial arts and daring stuntwork. In truth, he's a lecher and a drunk with deteriorating kung fu skills. An investigative reporter (Chingmy Yau) is onto him, so she finagles some tickets to a gala showing of the Russian Tsar's crown jewels at a luxury high-rise in order to get the scoop on Frankie, who has also been invited. Also attending are a gang of proffesional bad guys, led by the nefarious Doctor, who are out to steal the jewels for themselves. As it happens, one of the villains, a long-haired killer named Bond, is obsessed with killing Frankie in combat. It's up to Kit to beat the bad guys and rescue the hostages, and Frankie to live up to his image.
