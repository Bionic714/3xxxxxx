,shaboinker12,2008-07-03T07:16Z,Download speed was amazing but when i hit setup on Warcraft 1 the cmd.exe flashes up but nothing happens. When i hit setup on Warcraft II a cmd.exe flashes up but then the screen goes black for a few seconds then comes back. What the heck is happening?
,Teh_Goose,2008-07-04T17:34Z,"@Shhako (and maybe others)

It will ask you for the CD if you try to run war2.exe or mount the Warcraft 2 directory as part of the dosbox command. Instead, make a new file called war2.bat:-

mount D C:\ (or wherever your warcraft 2 directory is)
D:
cd WARCRA~1 (or it might be WARCRA~2 or WARCRA~3 if you've unpacked Warcraft 1 to the same place or have Warcraft 3 installed or whatever)
war2.exe

Then run dosbox war2.BAT, rather than war2.exe and it shouldn't ask you for the CD when you try to play single-player."

,RO71,2008-08-21T07:32Z,"does anyone know how to slow down the scroll speed cuz it cant be slowed down by using the in game menu,it kinda kills the game."
