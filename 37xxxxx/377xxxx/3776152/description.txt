Avg. Rating:  	
  3.8 / 5 (based on 18 ratings).

Plot:	Part three of the famous four-part epic.

Overview:	Renowned film director Chang Cheh returns for a third time with Ti Lung, Alexander Fu Sheng and a stellar supporting cast in The Brave Archer 3 to create a far-out martial arts spectacle that rivals its two predecessors, a rarity in any film industry. Chang's heroes live for death while encapsulating themselves within their own world, but at the right time, will altruistically explode. That's what makes this film a blast.
