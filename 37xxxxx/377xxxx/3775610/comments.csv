,cacollun,2008-09-07T06:14Z,"well i installed this game, everything worked fine till i started playing it. the problem is - when the real gameplay starts i can't see anything, the whole screen goes haywire. i can hear sound and all but screen is not clear. i read your instructions and put the resolution to 800*600 through game options, then i could see a little of the game but still the screen is not clear. 
please help, btw thanks, keep up the good work."
