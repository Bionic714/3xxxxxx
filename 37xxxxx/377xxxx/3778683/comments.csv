,420dopeman,2007-08-23T17:08Z,"There's a rather large 'text box' in the center of all my descriptions and nfo's.  
If you read the text, it will tell you what has been done to each and every game I rip.

This one has the only 'credits' ripped (removed).

greeetz.

,igetmyshitforfree,2009-04-05T02:16Z,I remember cold fear :S CREEPY game:P
,Haeres,2009-04-06T03:35Z,"Its weird. As soon as I had downloaded it, I tried it. Worked like a charm. I even botherred starting the first level, see that it actually WORKS in gameplay.
It does.

Days later, I've finished another torrented game (I played CF before on xBox, but the crap 360 won't handle it now).
The day after, first thing I wanted to do is now try CF. And somehow, after a few seconds I keep getting the ""Cold Fear has stopped working..."" bullshit.
The screen didn't even change.

Its so friggin' weird. First time it ran like a charm, and now it won't!
I can't remember any changes I've done to my graphic card or something that MIGHT screw it up. But if anyone has any idea's, they're more then welcome.
CF is a great game, even though some claim its an attempt to beat other creepy games, but it was surely worth the money I payed for it few years ago (the old xBox one)."

,Just2commentz,2012-06-23T08:00Z,"ATTENTION RETARDS:

If you cannot figure out how to get this game or any of dopeman's uploads working then you really should stop downloading torrents and buy the game since your too stupid to actually pirate them."
