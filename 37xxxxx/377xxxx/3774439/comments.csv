,dnitemare,2008-04-24T00:58Z,"this is a ripped version of the game meaning the music and or voices have been taken out..... the best way is to turn off all sound to play this game, but some sounds may work. it's been a long time since i've played it... but you had to turn off two of the three sounds atleast if i recall right.... still it's a great game.... the removal of the wav files was for a smaller download a long time ago when people still hosted the game on websites.... but anyways.....

point: to play this game, turn off the sound in the options. enjoy.... it's one of the best games to this day :) it's a clasic."
