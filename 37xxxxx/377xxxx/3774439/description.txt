Life has been rough for Ranmaru Hibikiya.  Bedridden as a child with a
mysterious illness, he's had to spend most of his time alone, drugged,
wondering if he would live to adulthood.  Now, however, things are getting
better for him.  His health has improved; he only experiences the occasional
seizure.  Also, he's been enrolled in his uncle's distinguished institution,
the Asao Private School.

Of course, this fortuitous turn isn't without a catch.  His uncle, a rather
mysterious man, installed Ranmaru at Asao to serve as his spy.  Ranmaru
begins an innocuous investigation, not really expecting to find anything
important.  Soon, however, he finds himself immersed in horrifying,
supernatural events that could claim his life at any moment.

Divi-Dead is a menu-driven adventure game.  You control Ranmaru's
movements as he investigates the campus of the school.  The places you

directly affect Ranmaru's fate.  Pay attention!  Every detail is
important in piecing together this mysterious tale.
