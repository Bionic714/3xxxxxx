,Sarge_TJ,2007-09-21T07:30Z,This is in Norweigan... You should mention that in the heading.
,aamot_seff,2007-10-01T23:44Z,"ops, sorry Sarge_TJ, i forgot :P. And izldizl, i`m gonna try to find my cd key witch came with the Office pack 2000, when i do that, you can go to www.serials.ws and try to find itj there, let me know if none of them work so i can give you all the correct cd key.

Edit: Maybe someone of this works: B8B2G-3J4GP-R27RB-8Y848-QYGYM OR BHJ2Y-8G4FJ-T8BFK-2YMCQ-P84HC OR GC422-KV8HQ-QPKYT-9Q2XW-TPK98 OR s/n:CHDYV-GH8RC-PC9Q4-7V3M2-QDMK6 OR serial: DT3FT-BFH4M-GYYH8-PG9C3-8K2FJ, i havent had the time to check them, but i think it should work :D

Enjoy!
