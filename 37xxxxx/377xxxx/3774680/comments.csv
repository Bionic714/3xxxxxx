,1sh1g4mi,2009-02-17T23:48Z,"Thanks for the CD version. This version can be updated easily from the homepage which is a great advantage over the web installer.

I have a small bug but I am sure that one is due to my fucked up FSX installation as it occurs with any of the web installer as well. 
The cockpit windows of the exterior model are painted over in either blue or black instead of being clear. Anyone may have a lead how to solve this?"
