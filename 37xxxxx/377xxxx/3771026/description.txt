Battle for the Holy Land: Love Thy Neighbour


Forty years after the Israeli capture of Jerusalem during the Six-Day War,
journalist Rod Liddle takes a journey through the West Bank and considers
whether Israel should still be considered a part of the western club of
democratic nations. A long time supporter of Israel, he visits families
in both the Palestinian and Jewish settlements surrounding Bethlehem and
then meets with Israeli Deputy Defence Minister Ephraim Sneh to discuss
his observations.
