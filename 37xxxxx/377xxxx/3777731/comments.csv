http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?d3dx9_26

Just copy the DLL file into the pSX folder and it should run smoothly.

The game is located in the cdimages folder and you simply need to use the insert CD image under the file menu to start the game. A memory card file has been premade for you. 

Enjoy."
