Every   NTSC   Wii   CD   Size   Cover   Thru 08/14/07

This my collection of CD size Wii covers I made.
Included is every NTSC Wii cover that I photo shopped to fit a standard CD size wallet or CD jewel case.

Included is also a template I created with Excel to print 2 CD size covers at a time.

I made these covers for one purpose.  I was looking for a way to save space and make my CD wallet look great.  I do not condone pirating games or any other media.
