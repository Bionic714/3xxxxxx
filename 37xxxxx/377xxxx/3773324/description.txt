        How does this work ?                                                
                                                                            
        Internet Cyclone is designed to automatically change many           
        registry settings in Windows such as:                               
        Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU), Maximum Segment Size (MSS), Time   
        To Live (TTL), TCP Receive Window (Rwin), Cache Size (NDI), PMTU    
        Black Hole Detect, PMTU Auto Discovery (PAD), Session Keep Alive    
        (SKA) and some Windows Extra settings like: Selective               
        Acknowledgement (SACK), Maximum Duplicate Acknowledge (Max          
        DupAcks), Large Window Scaling, Ports COM, VCache value,            
        Combuffer value, Internet Explorer settings, Maximum connection     
        per server.                                                         
                                                                            
        If these settings are not correctly optimized then you will not     
        get the best performance of your Internet Connection. Internet      
        Cyclone is a proof method to change these settings easily and       
        quickly.  If you are an experienced user, then with this Internet   
        optimizer you can set these values manually and speed up Internet   
        at maximum.                                                         
                                                                            
                                                                            
        How much speed can you gain with Internet Cyclone ?                 
                                                                            
        It will not make your 56k dial-up modem connection to 100k. If      
        you have the Internet connection speed at 56k, it provides you to   
        use it with the best performance. For example we were informed by   
        other people that this Internet optimizer helped them to boost      
        their high speed Internet connections up to 120kb/s (this means a   
        boost of 400%). Microsoft publishes Windows operating systems       
        with default settings (the most compatible settings with all        
        systems). But you cannot get the best performance with this         
        default values. At that moment, you need Internet Cyclone to        
        change those values for you.                                        
                                                                            
        In the UNREGISTERED version of Internet Cyclone there are           
        disabled the extra settings in Windows registry such as: SlowNet    
        Option, SACK Option, Max DupAcks, Large Window Scaling, Maxim       
        Connection per Server, VCache value, Combuffer value, the speed     
        of Com ports, Maximum Sockets Value and Maximum Connection Value    
        which will improve even more your Internet connection speed.
