,RubberFist,2008-04-17T21:23Z,"OH FFS! The keygen works fine, the user is the damn issue. Click Already Paid->Not connect to internet...It gives you the product code, paste it into keygen to get unlock code."
,stic68,2008-04-17T22:19Z,Keygen worked on 3rd try after I used Johanna89's product code.  Games works great otherwise.
,kratos24,2008-04-29T02:03Z,thanx works fine. nice upload
,boardkitty,2008-05-14T22:04Z,"what you need to do is run the setup, then do the setup wizard, and on the registration area where it says trial or more games or buy it or pay for it, and they ask for the activation code, you don't use that at all.  below in black letters you will see a not connected to the internet option and you click that, which i think is what rubberfist was trying to say, only you don't click already paid. anyway, when u hit the not connected button, it brings up some code.  copy and paste it into the keygen, the top bar, hit generate, the unlock code is what you copy and paste back into the setup area, and then it's yours!!  it felt nice when i figured out what rubberfist was talking about.  thanks for the game by the way, i love it!!"
,icer18sea,2008-07-13T09:24Z,"I had this game and i spent 3 hours looking for my back up or a copy of it but for the life of me i can't find it anywhere.
