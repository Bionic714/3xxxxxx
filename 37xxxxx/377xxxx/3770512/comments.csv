please seed, I promise to seed it afterwards for at least a day.
Thanks"
,davidpe,2009-06-01T22:42Z,"Please seed as long as possible, I've noticed many users d/l the torrent and then doing a hit&run.

I've uploaded 2x the size of the torrent =, but still am struggling to get past the 65% mark.

There is only 1 major seeder on this torrent, and given that only true fans would be d/l this, share a thought for the other fans out there and please share. :-)"
