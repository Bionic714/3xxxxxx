,bushucks,2007-12-14T18:38Z,What do people know about this torrent.  I really wanna download it but have no feed back
,PathDaemon,2008-01-26T06:47Z,"bushucks et al:
It's 588x240, DivX 5.0 and MP3 audio encapsulated in AVI, bitrate about 709Kb/s... there are two or three pixels of black on the right side of the frame, but otherwise quality is exactly what you'd expect from a DVDRip.

Would recommend.

P.S. first comment! Been lurking TPB for a while, just got an account."

SEED PLEASE!!"
,jonsmithgreen,2008-04-21T21:46Z,"Troy, I've come across this problem before, I think you need to get a life. Try this-
1) Pull yourself away from the computer for an hour or two. Perhaps even venture into the garden.  
2) Consider an alternate hobby to juggle with being on the computer (does not include wanking). 
3) Stop squeeling like a trapped pig when you can't get things to work. It makes you sound about 10. How old are you anyway? 
Hope this helps
Jon"

,SilentEyes,2008-10-13T01:23Z,"@ jonsmithgreen, dechy, waxbar1, jaurice

This Conversation is making me laugh. Non of you had to say anything at all about it. 
obviously he figured out what his problem was when he stated:

""sorry it my computer""

doesn't seem to me like he needs much more help then some more RAM, a new processor, a graphics card, and maybe the correct drivers to run it all. -_-


BUT, on another note, Thanks HOLLA2007 for the nice upload. Keep the good work up, hope to see more uploads from you like this in the near future.

5* for you ^_^"
,SilentEyes,2008-10-13T01:25Z,"EDIT:

@guzzar
