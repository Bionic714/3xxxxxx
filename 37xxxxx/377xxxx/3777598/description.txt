Airport Facilitator X - Control, Modify, and Create New Destinations 

Modify Existing Airports Or Create New Ones!

AFX is a powerful airport editor for FS2004 and FSX for both novice and expert Flight Simulator users. You can easily modify any of Flight Simulator airports, convert your favorite AFCADs to FSX and enhace them with FSX-specific features, or even design a new airport from scratch.

AFX allows you to add, modify, or remove runways, taxiways, and paths, taxiway signs, aprons, start location, navaids, parking spots and many more airport features. 

For FSX airports, it can add fences, moving jetways, vehicle links and parking spots. The utility also gives you access to FSX-specific runway markings and other attributes.
