,Oggeman,2007-08-18T22:19Z,Great man! I have been looking for this one :)
,slave179,2007-08-18T22:47Z,"Great Upload!
Thanks!"
,N537JB,2007-08-18T23:01Z,"Cool, ruud. Finally u get ur own releases! :) Sounds nice."
,N537JB,2007-08-18T23:02Z,forgot to say the headword: Thanks :)
,N537JB,2007-08-18T23:25Z,Huh? is this another WoZ release? wtf 
,Beeeye,2007-08-18T23:54Z,yeah i'll give ya credit for being a douchebag..... YOU just dont get it. nobody cares where anything comes from already. 
,rossirep,2007-08-19T00:00Z,Trojan detected by kasperky... hmmm 
,4X-AXG,2007-08-19T00:06Z,why not just fucking give in? because it's way too much fun seeing you guys go ballistic :D
,neslesman,2007-08-19T01:36Z,"Petty nonsense abounds.  You would think 4X had been caught sleeping with somebody's wife rather than posting a legitimate torrent.  90% of what has come out of Wingz came from here in the first place, not the new stuff but the majority overall.
Methinks some people have waaaayyyyy too much time on their hands.
Thanks 4X."
,eNuffSaid,2007-08-19T02:15Z,"Again thanks very much, 4X. Keep 'em coming. "
,neslesman,2007-08-19T02:40Z,"LOL
Thank you calinorg."

,iflyc77,2007-08-21T11:31Z,"Thanks!!!

But at the same time, this is only version 1.0 :[
A few days after its relese, Version 1.01 came out, that has a ""back ground: image feature...

So I guess...

REQ = AFX v1.01! lol"
,4X-AXG,2007-08-21T20:32Z,"lol yes of course, there is probably a HUGE difference between v1.0 and v1.01!"
,iflyc77,2007-08-22T02:48Z,"actually there is!

v1.01 has a feature so that you can import a background image to make your layouts more realistic.

You can see all the extra feautres in the v1.01 demo they have"
,duder1,2007-08-23T05:00Z,"If anyone could help seed on http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3526572/FS2004_-_FS_Global_2005_North_America_[Install_Rip]

,crabdavid,2007-09-09T14:25Z,"Hey 4X-AXG

Nice upload. Please write how to install. It never recognizes itself and gives WARNINGS and/or FAULTS.
Please write 'HOW TO INSTALL'

Thx"
,Raptor05121,2007-09-13T04:13Z,"HERE IS HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN AFX:

1.) Run the Installer.

2.) Run the crack. You should get an error message saying to search for it. Click ""okay"" and go to: ""C:\Program Files\FLIGHT1\AFX"" and select the .exe

3.) Click patch once, then to make sure you got it, click again. Close patch.

4.) DELETE the icon on your desktop. Then browse to: ""C:\Program Files\FLIGHT1\AFX"" and right click on ""AFX.exe"" and select ""Send to: Desktop""

5.) Run the .exe.  Enjoy!

6.) Note: When selecting FS9 or FSX for the first time, it will take about 3-5 mins for it to completely load. Once it has done this, future loads wont take as long. Please be patient!


Working method found by your truly!"
