I'm helping put together a 70's themed birthday party.  There will be no shortage of music to move to.  Thanks again."

,g8aso,2008-03-16T16:14Z,"Thanks, but the sound is severely compromised firstly, by using VBR - very little disk space saved versus loss of quality.............but more seriously by the use of Joint stereo rather than proper stereo, all the high frequencies lost and much of the stereo separation.

But thanks for the effort anyway!"

,wrocnrob,2008-06-06T09:11Z,"Pay no attention to g8aso, the mp3's are Lame 3.97 VBR, and they are good.  I use --preset extreme, but I still can't ABX the difference between the flac files.

Disco is a little before my time, but this funky 70's stuff is alright--nice beat.  That's probably why people were dancing to it back then.  Thanks BSW."
