,xaleel,2009-04-10T07:21Z,it says abort retry ignore while install goes
,Tintin_26,2009-06-30T06:22Z,"Okay, so I got the stupid CRC error while trying to install this game after mounting the .nrg filw with Daemon Tools. I tried for a work-around and finally was able to run the game. 

Here's how:

When you get than error you will have 3 options to click on: Cancel, Ignore, Retry. Simply click  the IGNORE option to ignore these errors while installing and the entire installation will complete. Then just hit the desktop shortcut and the game will start!"

,vissh,2011-04-21T05:22Z,"Thanks for upload :D 
Mounted the .nrg file with POWER ISO and setup started.
Got 4-5 CRC errors But Pressing Ignore worked and game installed :D
Kept the .nrg mounted by Power iso and Played 4 areas and it is working fine (^.^)
Lets see if it works for full game or not :)"

,deep_enjoy,2011-09-24T23:23Z,"I had this game previously and it was around 600 MB, this one is 300, so I guess that is why a few levels might not work."
