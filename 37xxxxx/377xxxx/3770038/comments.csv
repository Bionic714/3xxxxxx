Little comment though... the Genesis-part of the collection is a bit messy! :) The ""Genesis - Platinum Collection"" contains Phil Collins' Platinum collection instead, so this part is missing. Otherwise great work!"

,graplegromet,2008-10-24T02:51Z,"Nice download. Ummm, not that I am ungrateful but, it would be nice to mention that most of this music is sampled at 192kbs. If you have a decent sound system, anything less than either 320kbs or vbr sounds flat. Thanks anyway but I'll be tossing this..."
