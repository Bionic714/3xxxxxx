Next Generation Media: The Global Shift, A Report of the Forum on Communications and Society, by Richard P. Adler, Rapporteur, The Aspen Institute, 2007.

Next-Generation Media: The Global Shift examines the growth of the Internet and its effect on a rapidly changing topic: the impact of new media on politics, business, society, culture, and governments the world over. The report also sheds light on how traditional media will need to adapt to face the competition of the next generation media.

In the sessions on ?Next Generation Media: The Global Shift? the group explored two major shifts brought about by the new media: user-generated content and the emergence in online communities of interest in both creating and sharing information. Participants explored how the blogosphere creates transparency and trust, as well as polarization and disinformation, all of which has a tremendous impact on the delivery of news, the growth of brands, and virtually every other aspect of life today.

In the session on the impact of media on global issues, the participants were critical of governmental approaches to public diplomacy over the years, particularly since 9/11, and concluded that it might be more effective for US citizens and businesses to reach out to the international community themselves to counter the negative image of America -- a "citizens' diplomacy." Others suggested that the country look at the issue as "brand management," with similar approaches of researching and listening to the international community.

After exploring in a simulation the prospects for direct digital democracy (much skepticism), the group concluded with a session on how new media can have a positive impact on leadership on a global level through the free flow of information and open democracy. The roundtable co-chair Marc Nathanson proposed adding ?Access to Appropriate New Technology? to the existing 8 Millenium goals of the United Nations. Funmi Iyanda stated that the meeting had inspired her to reach out to the youth in Nigeria via her television show to encourage them to innovative and become leaders, using the new technologies in doing so.

-LEGAL TORRENTS

Purpose:

create a balance, share the already free stuff,
public domain works, freeware, free music,
free ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.

show the copyright owners that torrent
websites shouldn't bear the responsibility
of what their users upload, torrent websites
are very much similar to google..

users upload what they want to upload,
download what they want to download,
and search for what they want to search..

by creating this balance and sharing the already free
stuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..
