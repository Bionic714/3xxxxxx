,crowaura,2007-11-25T21:42Z,Help please. My download does not connect. I am using Transmission Torrent Client. I don't know why some torrents connect and some do not. Any help is appreciated to explain this. Fluid is awesome and I sure could use it. Thx many!
,crowaura,2007-11-25T21:55Z,"Well?  got I Tomato client and it took five minutes but  did connect and is downloading, Why is Transmission client banned freakquently? Is that why I cant get connections? Tomato is getting this download now. Thx"
,crowaura,2007-11-25T22:03Z,"jeez: Tranmission now is trying. I got short peep of a connection. And I will see what happens with this. It took a long time to start and ain't much for speed. 
I was using Bit Torrent, teh original when the rest the world was sleeping. It was much faster in the beginning days four years ago. I wonder why speed declined and why things are no better today. I don't know the technical reasons. But I am ever grateful for peer to peer transmissions."
,crowaura,2007-11-26T00:54Z,"The krack's part wasnt successful. I need a serial.
Does anyone have for this version? It's not found in teh usual places yet"
,crowaura,2007-11-27T03:40Z,"Serial needed for plugin 
Stand alone is kracked but not plugin

Serial needed THX"
,ContentRatedX,2008-03-02T07:11Z,"Guys, I use Azureus, and it works great. Its so fast it even scares me a little. So give it a try. It MAY be alittle CPU consuming, but just shut off un-needed apps, or leave it on while you sleep. It's good, fast and reliable."
,ViDER,2008-03-05T02:01Z,"What are the requirements for this?
Would it work on a G3?

Thanks!"

,dchiou,2008-10-09T06:28Z,"meaculpah, this is a mac version of fluid mask.
"
,dataflows,2008-12-08T07:26Z,"On installation I get ""there were errors installing the software"" please try installing again. Anyone any idea what's going on? Tried it after removing the Fluid Mask 2 folder from the plugins folder, tried it with the folder there (since it was), tried installing it standalone.... all the same message at the same point in installation process: writing files. Que pasa?"
,CoffeeStained,2009-08-17T01:32Z,"It works, the plugin was successfully installed as described in the comments... but the app itself is no Mask Pro 4. Anyone got that?"
,deadmike06,2010-09-04T00:15Z,PLEASE SEED!!! I AM STUCK AT 60%!!!
