The Ister is a 3000km journey to the heart of Europe, from the mouth of the Danube river on the Black Sea, to its source in the German Black Forest. Hailed by Scott Foundas of Variety as \"a philosophical feastÃ¢??at which it is possible to gorge oneself yet leave feeling elated,Ã¢?? the film is based on the work of the most influential and controversial philosopher of the 20th century, Martin Heidegger, who in 1933 swore allegiance to the National Socialists. By joining a vast philosophical narrative with an epic voyage along EuropeÃ¢??s greatest waterway, The Ister invites you to unravel the extraordinary past and future of Ã¢??the West.Ã¢??

Awarded the National Research Cinemas Association (GNCR) Prize at the Marseille International Documentary Festival in 2004, and the Quebec Film CriticÃ¢??s Association Documentary Prize at the Festival du Nouveau CinÃ?Â©ma MontrÃ?Â©al, 2004.

IMDB Review:

Warning: this is not a popcorn movie! A lot of people like to talk about how The Matrix is about philosophical ideas. It is, but of the \"beginners\" variety. If you want more depth and breadth to your ideas, you must see this film. It does take a while to get going and there is no way to understand the whole thing in one viewing (over three hours long!). For some this will be a liability, but if you like films that reveal their pleasures over multiple viewings then this is one for you. There is a lot going on; a trip up the Danube river, interviews with archeologists, engineers and ecologists along the river, festivals, ruins, marches, and that\'s just the simple stuff. A narration sits on top of all of this, provided by three philosophers and a white-haired German filmmaker I had not heard of at the end. They discuss technology, politics and ethics, and it\'s all woven together in a way that means that you always feel like you are heading somewhere important. Where you end up, well, I found it quite moving. There a lot of layers to this film and if you make an effort to dig you\'ll be rewarded. NB I saw this at the ICA Cinemas in London last year.
