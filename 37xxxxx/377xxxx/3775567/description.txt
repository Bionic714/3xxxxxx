There is a place on our planet which is stranger than any other - the least known and most mysterious. It is a juncture not unlike outer space, where conventional notions of time and distance evaporate. It is a magical and dangerous place to which the human body, as well as the human spirit, must adapt. It is the only place where a man named Jacques Mayol truly feels at home. It is the sea - "The Big Blue."
