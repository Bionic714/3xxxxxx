,Jimston,2009-04-06T11:17Z,"I am seeding the other version, and will for quite a long time. But my max upload is only 150kb/s

It's as fast as it gets for me."
,Jimston,2009-04-09T05:27Z,"Just a note, the other smaller version works 100%

Every chapter and file is perfect with 10/10 for audio quality.

Not sure of this one though, also not sure as to why it's twice the size, but none the less thanks for this upload as well."
