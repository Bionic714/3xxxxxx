Preamble: This package includes the aged Meridian 59 game, up to the Renaissance expansion, it does not include any of the fandangled graphical "improvements" that were introduced a couple years ago when NDS (near death studios) bought the rights, still a fantastic game in its own regards. Google the game to check out some screenies and info before playing the game, just so you will know what to expect :D
