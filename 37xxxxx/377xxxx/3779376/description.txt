Based on Mario Puzo's best selling novel, The Sicilian tells the real life story of Salvatore Giuliano, hero of the Sicilian people, an outlaw who could obey no rule and a man not afraid to die for his people. Known as the Lord Of The Mountains, he chose to defy the Church, the State and the Mafia underworld in an attempt to liberate Sicily from Italian rule and score its independence. In a land that knew only oppression and death he offered the dream of freedom and from his mountain stronghold rode along into legend. However, legendary status comes with a price as Guiliano's arrogance prompts a Judas-like betrayal from his backer, Mafia Don Masino Croce.
