,gavader,2010-02-01T23:23Z,hmm i can't get the audio to work. any ideas?
[V],lord_terabyte,2011-01-29T13:38Z,Anyone having audio problems should just try a different player that lets them select the correct audio stream. I use VLC.

I bought the DVD but it's another region and I can't be bothered getting out the old multi region DVD player to watch it. Stupid country and it's lack of access to anything (and they blame piracy... aaaanyway)"
