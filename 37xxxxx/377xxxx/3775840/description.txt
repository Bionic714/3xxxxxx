Plot: As the new kid at a strict Catholic boys' school, Jerry Renault (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) longs to be part of the notorious gang of thugs known as "the Vigils" (headed by Wally Ward). But when the school's ambitious headmaster (John Glover) enlists the Vigils to help him "persuade" everyone to participate in a fund-raising drive to sell chocolate bars, Jerry discovers that membership comes at a dear price. Based on the book by Robert Cormier.
