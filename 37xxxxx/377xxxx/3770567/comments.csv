,edmlds,2007-08-16T04:39Z,Downloaded 299 times and only one comment about the quality?  WTFIGO?  Also I am seeing one seeder and 143 leechers.  Those numbers don't add up to me.  But thanks to the uploader for the effort.  I am sure he is the only one seeding.
,montyrob,2007-08-17T13:00Z,I have been stuck at 59% or 3 days now. WTF ???????
,razberry,2007-08-17T18:58Z,benjirman.. is there something wrong with this?? maybe you should re-up it
,razberry,2007-08-18T16:01Z,has anyone actually successfully grabbed this torrent? seems like the stats are fucked.. so can someone comment please?

,Khorzoo,2007-09-05T21:22Z,"the quality is really good and watchable but I'm sure that I've seen a version with better quality, a few days ago I've seen a cam version that really amazed me because at first I thought its the DVD version but then i realized by audio that its a cam version, I'm searching everywhere for it and when i find it i will surly upload it so keep an eye on my posts, by the way I'm really sorry for the idiot who wrote above comment"
,Khorzoo,2007-09-05T22:36Z,"here are two video samples and a few picture samples, I've tried to put these links in my comment but no matter how hard I tried i always got database error when trying to write the comment so here is the torrent for it:
