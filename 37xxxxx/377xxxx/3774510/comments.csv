,sylverwytche,2009-02-12T13:40Z,Scratch tht i can comment DO NOT DOWNLOAD! I unpacked it went through all the normal routines with such software then restarted my comp windows didnt load properly so the repair tool did then i restarted and all looked ok until nortons went nutty and said definitions were out of date turned off everything etc Ive had to go through several different methods to put this right and im still trying to find out what exactly caused this i.e what trojan/virus/malware was in this package! People who create this shit should be shot!
