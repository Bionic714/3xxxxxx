Plot: Animator Ralph Bakshi conjures up a violent universe populated by hustlers and punks, sad-eyed prostitutes and sullen gangsters. Coonskin looks at the bleak life and rude energy of the American inner city. "A shattering, successful effort, it's a work of brilliance and innovation" ( New York Times ). One of the most controversial films ever made, Coonskin is an angry, violent portrayal of Harlem street life and the black condition of the 1970s. Live action and animation, starring Barry White, Scatman Crothers and Philip Michael Thomas.
