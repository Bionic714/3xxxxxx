,greenthumbz2,2007-08-15T22:31Z,SORRY YES THE TIMER STAYS AND FORGOT TO SAY THERE IS A SAMPLE TO ENJOY ALL GREAT MOVIE GT
,streetho,2007-08-15T22:35Z,"this should have been labeled a WORKPRINT rather than a screener. 

i had this already before i came here, it has a watermark across the top and a large counter across the bottom through out the movie.

 watch for it to be nuked over calling it a screener.

also i would say it's a VHS rip rather than a DVD-rip. 

download it it's alright but see if i haven't told you correctly."
,greenthumbz2,2007-08-15T23:04Z,WELL ID SAY WHAT THEY NUKEIN FOR IF WORKPRINT OR SCREENER THE QUALITY IS THERE FUCK THE WATERMARKS AND TIMER IT DIDNT BOTHER ME FOR FREE !
,karlsson_patriot,2007-08-15T23:24Z,"nice, great quality :D"
,pimpwiththis,2007-08-16T00:20Z,Thanks bro. the water-Mark also does not bother me!  Great job....
,warpengi,2007-08-16T02:09Z,"Streetho you tool.  There's no scene designation workprint.  So if it's a DVD rip and not from a retail DVD the closest you can get to naming it is DVDScreener.  

Nuked my ass.  Not for the designation.  Maybe it should be for only rebranding the iMBT rip though."
,streetho,2007-08-16T05:54Z,it has been nuked . and it was because it was a workprint rather than a screener. also the group iMBT made post as there's when it was a p2p release . so warpengi you are the tool. if you have never heard of a workprint you must be a newbe . 
,streetho,2007-08-16T05:55Z,greenthumbz2 i have a bag of shit for FREE!
,carolinawolf,2007-08-16T06:13Z,"in streetho's defense all i seen was a true statement made about the release being a workprint and being nuked as it has been at vcdquality 

all streetho did was tell the truth and you guys jumped his or her shit. "
,warpengi,2007-08-16T17:56Z,"Where was it nuked?  Not on any of the sites I've seen it on.  Also, show me a movie on pirate bay designated as workprint.  You don't know the fuckin scene.

That is further proven by accusing this release of being a VHS rip.  That's just plain stupid.  Not the greatest quality but not much below average for a 700mb rip.

Looks like you got company on the short bus with Carolinawolf.  Maybe a budding romance?"
