A modern day look at America\'s war on drugs told through four separate stories that are connected in one way or another. A conservative politician who\'s just been appointed as the US drug czar learns that his daughter is a drug addict. A trophy wife struggles to save her husband\'s drug business, while two DEA agents protect a witness with inside knowledge of the spouse\'s business. In Mexico, a corrupt, yet dedicated cop struggles with his conscience when he learns that his new boss may not be the anti-drug official he made himself out to be.
