Plot: This Oscar-nominated adaptation of Peter Shaffer's Tony Award-winning play erupts on the screen with the same power and passion as the stage original. Richard Burton gives "one of his best performances ever" ('Boxoffice') in this "elegant and provocative" ('Newsweek') take of myth and madness. 

What would drive Alan Strang (Peter Firth), a troubled adolescent stable boy, to blind six horses with a metal spike? Psychiatrist Martin Dysart (Burton) investigates these unspeakable acts and delves deep into Alan's psyche, confronting the mysteries of sexual passion and madness - as well as the dark demons buried within his own soul.
