V=7
A=Didn't paid attention, but seems good.

And I don't know why people still use the Divx codec. H.264 has much better quality for size. Download movies from NewArtRiot or nHaNc3 and you'll see what I'm talking about.

Anyway, thanks for sharing."
,nerys,2008-04-25T19:08Z,Thats Easy. H264 Sucks. How many Set Top boxes play H264? How many Portable Media Players worth having (IE not ipod) Play H264? How many Pre Existing players play Divx? considering a good encode to 700mb looks just like DVD on a 40+ inch screen why in the world would you BOTHER with H264 and all the associated hassles.? For Now at least H264 sucks. Pretty Much everything plays DIVX and the quality is more than good enough. They you have more problem. Harder to compress harder to play harder to convert to something else. Also H264 temps people to USE the advanced compression so you end up with a great looking video AS LONG as you do not convert it to anything else. When torrents start coming in H264 is when I stop downloading them. Just not worth it as I would get better quality and need less advil if I just rented/bought the DVD myself.

,ilcapoditutticapi,2008-09-24T16:15Z,"If you are a newbee in this world, just as I was a month ago, you may be helped to know some ways to get a nice DVD.

1. Superb
An ISO file. This is an exact bit by bit copy of the original DVD (an it has the same size, so a lot of downloading).
The handling is very simple: use Nero, backup's, burn an image (that's the ISO file) to disc. Done? Then you have a DVD with all menus, subtitles and spoken languages.

2. Very good
Not so difficult at all, you have just to know. Make a directory (like MOVIE-XXX) with two subdirectories: one AUDIO_TS (leave it complete empty) and one VIDEO_TS (put all te files in it). Usually VOB (Video OBject ? the movie itself), IFO (InFOrmation like audio & subtitle info) BUP (BackUP ? reserve IFO). Remark: names of subdirectories must be in CAPITALS. Run DVD Shrink, point to the directory MOVIE-XXX), select backup and you have the complete DVD with all adds.

3. Good
Often you get DIVX files. The size about 800 Mb gives an idea of low resolution. Nope, it means very good compression. Import in in Nero and it explodes to 4.5 Gb of good quality. However after a succesfull burning session: no subtitles. Play it at your PC, no subtitles. Often you get a small file with a RAR extension. First find the WINRAR software. Not at a commercial site (only 30 day usage or so), just with ThePiratebay or Isohunt. WINRAR is like ZIP, a packing/compressing program. Unpacking gives you two files, one .sub and one .idx. Both must have the same name as the video file an must be in the same directory. So Movie.avi, Movie.sub and Movie.idx in one dir. Now you have subtitles when playing the movie at your PC. Still not on DVD. If your lucky, the seeder gave you a .srt
Must be in the same dir as the avi (give it the same name as the .avi, just to be sure). Don't use Nero, however ConvertXtoDVD. First download this from Piratbay/Isohunt (else you get an nice logo ""buy this software"" in your movie). Point ConvertXtoDVD to the appropriate directory and burn. You get a kind of menu when playing the DVD at your TV to make choices for spoken and subtitle languages.
Waouw, mustn't get worse! 
If didn't get a .srt file, you may find it at opensubtitles. Be aware: sometimes it is not sunchronized with your movie. The more the file name looks like your avi filename, the bigger the chance it is in sync.

4. Improve your knowledge of the spoken English

5. Forget all other types of files, takes a lot of time, offers only a bad mood.

Tip: buy an rewritable DVD, experiment, if the result is satisfying, make a diskcopy with Nero.

Software
Nero - use version 7, performs everthing, not heavely protected like version 8.
RAR - kind of packing software like ZIP
Vobsub - display subtitles when playing at your PC (run it once, kind of codex add-on to your mediaplayer)
DVD Shrink
ConvertXtoDVD - very usefull tool to get subtitles into your movie

Sites
www.thepiratebay.com torrents, movies, software
www.isohunt.com like the pirate bay
www.afterdawn.org loads of information how to burn, convert, and so on
www.opensubtitles.org to get subtitles in case the seeder did not enclosed it

Not wanting to complain, I also felt it was a shame that the sound was a bit too low for some dialogues but - hey - if I wanted perfect sound, perfect image (looks fine on my 17"" screen) and perfect everything, I should be buying the trilogy or wait, wait, wait and wait to download the 23.75 GiB trilogy with 31 seeders, instead of the 2.18 GiB torrent with 381 seeders...

,desquishybanana,2008-12-07T10:10Z,"oh and 7zip is not good for anything, it is limited to what it can read and it compresses most files at the same ratio as other compressors. 7zip is only good for archiving files that are already compressed, so have both winrar and 7zip, use winrar for extracting and fast compress, use 7zip for archiving. winrar can read almost every compress file types.

For today's standard, the quality is shit. It looks like a VHS tape. It's grainy, pixelated and it hurts my eyes. The resolution is very low (512x272) and the image quality is JPEG-like. I'm not sure why everyone is saying it's good quality, when it's not. Next time I'm not going to trust the comments so much.

Still, it's my fault. I could've taken attention to the filesize (2 hours in 700mb), but couldn't you have at least provided some technical details in the description?

I'm going to download SecretMyth's H.264/MP4 release instead. It's time to move on to newer and better technology."

,winterstellar,2011-05-15T08:29Z,"slightly better quality videos at the expense of another gigabyte or two of space taken up.... not worth it, to me.. AVI is the best imo.. i will download better quality videos when they start selling 5 TB hard drives for 300 bucks"
,winterstellar,2011-05-15T08:35Z,"do ppl seriously cry about a movie being in AVI format? i heard some psycho claim omg it hurts his eyes......... a slightly better picture at the expense of hard drive space is not worth it.. don't buy into the hype.. AVI is nice enough.. only retards buy new expensive stuff that's only slightly better than the cheap stuff.. blah blah blue ray w/e.. w/e.. ill be using blue ray in a few years when its dirt cheap while u are blowing 2 thousand bucks on the next big thing that isnt really big at all.. once again, ull be only slightly ahead of me.. and ull spend a fortune to get that inch"

""BUT what the darn do you mean by ""foreign"" seeders, you bloody qnt? i would prefer you'ld refer to us foreigners as the honourable people of a non-english speaking realm.

thank you in advance (you prick). ""

How's this: shut the fuck up because to someone living in America, someone living outside America is called a ""foreigner.""  A foreigner is someone who is not from your country, smart one. When you cry and complain and piss yourself to your foreigner friends over what Americans say, you can call us foreigners too, OK?? Hell, call us ""damn foreigners."""
,e-kill,2011-07-16T20:32Z,"AVI is good enough for a saturday! Anyone saying something else either has a big @ss screen or is dillusional ;-)

@ Zookab

PB is swedish, hence: Welcome to Sweden. When in Sweden, everyone besides swedes are foreigners, and since you have no fragging clue of who is what, you shut your piehole. God i hate ignorant foreigners..."

Lol @ everyone telling benderman there ARE sequels to the matrix. Ur all so naive.. What he meant was that the first movie was awesome and the rest sucked and that they are not worthy being called ""The matrix""..."

,ProphetZarquon,2011-12-01T03:23Z,"I agree with Benderman and XKCD.com:

http://m.xkcd.com/566/

The Matrix was a great movie.  ""Too bad they never made any sequels."" 'True.'

Anyway, yes the file size is too small.  The Matrix had great effects and action sequences.  Thanks for the upload but a higher bitrate really is necessary this time.  900mb would be preferred, but I'll go with a BluRay rip since that's what's fast and ready.

Yes, I do use a huge screen.  I like having a huge screen.  Sure, lots of my movies are low quality.  One is even on Laserdisc.  But I'm not going to download something new at that res...  Avoid!"

,zenithlol,2012-01-10T23:32Z,"why didn't you upload animatrix?
it contains key information as to how the matrix happened.
fucking retard.
probably didn't even understand what you were watching."
,XXD1XX,2012-02-11T18:28Z,"Thanks for uploading this!

I do disagree with your statement ""Not Animatrix, it sux"" though, some of the stories might have been a bit ""weird"" but they provide key background for The Matrix as a whole that shouldn't be discredited just because you didn't like something about it. It's kind of what Christian's do with the Bible, they pick and choose what they like and ignore the rest..."
,unusingur,2012-03-15T22:24Z,"people complaining about quality, instead ofcomplaining or ""going for etc"" why don't you just go for buying the damn thing?"

,JKapps,2012-05-28T06:05Z,"The Anti-matrix was alright, and necessary for the ""How it all came to be"" portion of the series, but due to the lack of funds, or dying interests (not sure which) they went cheap and did an animated short film. If they would have made it into a live action, full length video, it would be worth watching, however, it isn't and therefore has no replay value. I've seen it once, and it did clue in on some valuable info, but nothing you couldn't generalize on your own from the other films.

all in all, these are great movies! Thanks alot prepp_01 you helped complete my virtual video library!"
