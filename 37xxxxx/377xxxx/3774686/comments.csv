,Jaxxor5225,2008-12-01T04:58Z,"The lack of a season 6 has nothing to do with The New Tomorrow. The series was cancelled becaue of growing concern about the increasingly adult themes of the show (addiction, teen pregnancy, murder, etc.)

Which is hilarious considering there have been pregnant teenagers on the show since the pilot.

Easily the worst television show ever made. Thank you so much for sharing this truly awful spectacle with the world...THE DREAM MUST STAY ALIVE!"
,Sonic96,2009-04-29T07:06Z,upload season 6 plzzz
,BloodRaven666,2009-11-26T22:17Z,"@Jaxxor5225

False.

The show was canceled because the cast was getting too old and there was bigger competition out there. Another relatively big reason was that Dwayne Cameron(Bray) had a fight with Cloud 9,and he was one of the main characters.

I don't know where did you get that info,which is utterly stupid. The show always included things such as: rape,teenage pregnancy and murder. It was all there in the first season which was brilliant and deep. And they were planning to make season 6(the script exists) so...


Worst television show ever made? Are you being sarcastic? The show was not that good from season 4 on,mainly because of technos tribe,because they went from post - apocalyptic to futuristic.

Otherwise it was great,the acting,story(well,most of it),actors and the characters are so brilliant this became my favorite show of all time. And before downloading Season 1 from Dgrobyc,i never watched anything past season 4...soo..."
,ThroneZwei,2010-02-21T12:26Z,"not to whine or anything since these are the DVD rips i kinda want the scripts for season 6 that were included anyone got them x,x"
