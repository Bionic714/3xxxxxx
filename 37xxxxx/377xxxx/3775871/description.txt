SwiftSwitch 2.46 by Strider3282

Latest version aug-07

I wanted SwiftSwitch to be avilable as a torrent too, because of faster and better downloads, more trustworthy (virus and trojan protection) and cheaper for us in Zybez ;)

This version includes some major changes like:
 
*faster searches on stat look-up and price look-up
*lag reduction tool
*links to all databases, quest help and calculators
*upgraded screen shot tool (can host pictures more easily, including video capturing/hosting on youtube.com etc.)
*other bug fixes

(for complete list, see news page after downloading)

Please help SEEDING so we don't have to use our bandwidth (that's why we use the torrent service to save bandwidth, so lag reduction will be more effective)

Happy RuneScaping :) ...and SEED!
