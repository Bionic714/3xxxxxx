,craigeth,2008-04-28T19:32Z,"whats the deal. the first .rar folder contains a movie but none of the other folders do. i was using stuffitexpander to unzip the folders but that didnt work except on the first.

i tried using RAR expander but that told me the .rar file might be broken.

im on a mac by the way..."
