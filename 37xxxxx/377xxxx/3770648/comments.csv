Nah, fuck it, I'll find this stuff on Soulseek instead - having waited a week for merely 7,1% is just a bad uploader getting people pissed."
,badlands,2007-08-15T21:01Z,"PLEASE don't insult our intelligence by telling us that this torrent has stalled and there's another running, since that torrent is just as stalled as this one. Why put out stuff when you don't have the equipment - brain or technique - to share?"
,Yrgal,2007-08-17T14:34Z,"Hey buckethead badlands, no need to insult the uploader because he has a crappy line. A week you say? Then I've got news for you - in the rest of the world the week has 7 days, not 3.

Some of these albums are impossible to find and believe me, I've been looking for many years. Tonight this torrent will be 6 days old and I have 20% as I write this and I don't mind if it takes a month."
,Shadowmaker,2007-08-17T18:02Z,"WHat a badassuploader and what a waste to try and get this torrent DL! Man, this must be one of the most awesome torrents and WORST uploaders ever. Been DLing this since day one and I've got 12%. Brilliant! Fairlight2007, you are either the world's biggest amateur or asshole."
,Shadowmaker,2007-08-17T18:03Z,"Well, be sure it'll take at least a month. My guess is a year or more."
,Yrgal,2007-08-28T20:47Z,"2 weeks two days - almost done! (96%) Shadowmaker, don't make bets!"
,farlight2007,2007-08-29T02:02Z,That's finish Yrgal thank you for your kinds words to Mr badland and Mr Shadowmaker that they only have one neuron in his brains with diarrhea and his shit come out by the ears hasta otra quillo
,dochep,2007-08-29T03:52Z,"I haven't given up, but after 2+ weeks I'm still at 19%."
,Yrgal,2007-08-29T16:37Z,"No sweat, fairlight2007! You haven't by any chance anything with Jonathan Edwards?"
,dochep,2007-08-31T01:52Z,switched to Azureus from Transmission and had the whole thing in 4 hours!
