,strawberryhelmet,2008-05-18T02:56Z,Thanks a bunch..
,staern,2008-07-12T16:52Z,"Thanks, great record and great sound quality! Just one question: What's the meaning of putting all the songs together in one long ""suite"" with no ""silence"" between them?"
,hrnzt,2008-10-16T18:33Z,"great, much better than the so-called deluxe edition, which lacks water and i don't even know myself.

btw, what are you talking about staern? these songs are not ""together"" can't you see there are 16 files one for each song?"
,twkeru,2012-03-14T20:39Z,thank you!
