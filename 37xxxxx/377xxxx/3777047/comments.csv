,TUF,2007-08-18T21:45Z,699usd for an UPGRADE from previous versions is what it says on apple.com/logic.
,bladerunner,2007-08-20T06:32Z,"TUF: Well, thatÂ´s for Logic before version 7. This upgrade was available for $49 and isnÂ´t so anymore. Hopefully that means that a new version of Logic arrives then."
,the_gibson,2007-08-24T03:26Z,Nice one! I actually called Apple this week trying to buy this DVD. I even tried my local Apple store. It is definitely hard to come by. Lame move on Apple's part.
