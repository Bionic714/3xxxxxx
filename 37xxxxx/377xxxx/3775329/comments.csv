,Dientologo,2007-08-25T14:13Z,"Wow... just one comment?
Any of these work?"
,Paxthis,2007-09-07T15:03Z,Casse Nice choice :) just got mine aswell.. im trying downloading this and see if it works.
,cajunflavoredbob,2007-12-12T20:27Z,"Duck Hunt, Space Invaders, Bowling Master, Galaxian, Mappy, Rats & Spears, and Click Ball all work fine. They are for the PPC with the 240x320 resolution. Most of you with they WM5 240x240 won't be able to exit a couple of apps without a reset. The only one I could get to work properly on my WM5 device was the Snow Rally Canada. unfortunately, though, it's very awkward to steer as it requires you to use the selection stick on the keyboard for the gas, brakes, and steering. I couldn't figure out if there was a way to change it or not. I also could not seem to get COD 2 to work. It installed properly, but I cannot open the program. It tells me ""No Owner Information."" I'm not sure where to put in my info from the included keygen. 

Overall this is a great torrent for ppc users with the 240x320 resolution screens. Anyone using the square 240x240 res should still get it for COD 2 if you can get it to work."

Only thing it could use is a mouse and keyboard input ;)"
,mattelk,2008-01-17T04:41Z,Yea i get the No Ownership Info what sould we do
,mattelk,2008-01-17T04:50Z,"Got it. Copy the Dll file in the keygen and copy it to the Program Files folder in the COD2 folder

Thats it."
,drlovable,2008-06-24T04:06Z,"Well call me stupid, but  what ""Program Files folder in the COD2 folder???""

What am I supposed to do with the cab file? The keygen seems to work, but the cab file just contains a bunch of .00x files and an xml file. what am I missing?"
