Snooker - 2007 Shanghai Masters (Every match)

This is a complete pack of (just about) every match shown on Shanghai TV, 37 hours of live recordings in total. 

Every single commercial is cut out (that was a sheer drudgery I can tell you!).

Picture and sound quality is surprisingly good.

Enjoy! :)
