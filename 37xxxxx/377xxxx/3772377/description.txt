Test Drive is the name of one of the longest-running racing game franchises ever. Originally published by Accolade, which was later bought by Infogrames, the first title saw the light of day in 1987 and has since been followed by a stream of sequels. The Test Drive games are now published by Atari, the name which Infogrames renamed itself in 2003.
