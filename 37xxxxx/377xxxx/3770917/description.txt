BSW Presents - The Disco Collection Part 9 (FLAC-EAC)







The Disco Collection is a collection of classic and influential disco tracks that were recorded from the mid 1970's to the mid 1980's
featuring tracks from artists Chic, Sister Sledge, Earth Wind and Fire, Imagination, The Bee Gees, Boney M, Kool and the Gang,
KC and the Sunshine Band, Donna Summer, Heatwave, The Gap Band, and many, many more ..........................







Compilation Track Information







All tracks within this collection have been obtained from sources inside and outside of the internet (i cannot specify which individual tracks as that would take too long).
I mention this because i cannot guarantee 100% that all of the tracks in this collection have been ripped from an original Compact Disc source (i.e. "transcoded") but
to the best of my knowledge these tracks are of the best lossless quality i could find !!!!!!!!!
