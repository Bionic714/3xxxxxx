Looking for Andy Sidaris' early films, STACEY and SEVEN (aka SEVANO'S SEVEN). The only place online to get them is Cinemageddon, but when I try to register there, they don't send me a confirmation email. If anyone out there has these movies, or is a Cinemageddon members and can get them, please upload them to Pirate Bay! I'll be eternally grateful, and I'll seed indefinitely!

Please help! Thanks!"
