,mikecappa2,2010-12-02T15:36Z,"I made an account to ask this specific question becuase it's been bugging me now for a while. Do the people you ask to SEED SEED SEED come back to this page to read your comments? i really don't think so, and the fact that on most torrents there are about 500 people saying the exact same thing and nothing ever improves. so maybe a word of advice? have a brain (step one), and don't repeat something that was WRITTEN DOWN, it's not like you have to yell as if you were talking to people in the real world that may not hear you. so keep that in mind future visitors to this torrent. but like i said, i doubt i'm ever coming back to this page to read any replies to this..
