Having already proven his acting chops and box office draw with the blockbusters Initial D and Curse of the Golden Flower, Taiwanese singer Jay Chou makes his directorial debut in 2007 with the romantic drama Secret. Jay stars as a high school student who has just transferred to a new school known for its music program. He meets and falls in love with a cute and mysterious classmate (Guey Lun Mei, Blue Gate Crossing), but she has a secret that can tear them apart. A gentle mix of music and puppy love, this sweet and subtle film adds another notch to Jay\\\\\\\'s long list of accomplishments.

Other than starring, directing, and creating the story for the film, Jay also took care of the music, which plays a key role in Secret. The soundtrack comes with the film\\\\\\\'s score and four theme songs, including title theme Secret, a soft British-style rock number with moving melody and lyrics.
