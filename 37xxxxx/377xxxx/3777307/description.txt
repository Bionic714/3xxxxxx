 In this hard-charging manifesto, Tom Ehrenfeld directs our attention to Bill Swanson's act of plagiarism and asserts that by letting Swanson get by with a slap on the wrist is like letting the Enron folks off with a small fine and a few hours of community service.

-LEGAL TORRENTS

Purpose:

create a balance, share the already free stuff,
public domain works, freeware, free music,
free ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.

show the copyright owners that torrent
websites shouldn't bear the responsibility
of what their users upload, torrent websites
are very much similar to google..

users upload what they want to upload,
download what they want to download,
and search for what they want to search..

by creating this balance and sharing the already free
stuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..
