thanx"
,darksidzz,2007-09-22T12:08Z,I somehow doubt this is real :S
,Renegade1973,2007-09-23T11:39Z,"It is real (2nd film in trilogy), however I was trying for Extinction. Sadly i've tried a ton of fakes - is there a real one anywhere?"
,Tooshyguy454,2007-09-23T20:53Z,Can  anyone confirm if this is real or not?  This has been in theatres for days now and haven't found 1 real one yet!
,William Keller II,2007-09-25T02:56Z,I dont think the've released DVD yet.however you might try loder.
,LocoXXL,2007-09-25T15:25Z,"(@ Tooshyguy454 & William Keller II) This is NOT the third Resident Evil release, it is the SECOND. It came out three years ago and is not likely to be found in any movie theaters, save for the occasional one-screen small-town dollar-a-viewing cinema. In other words: yes, its a 'real' DVD rip, but not of the most recent release you're thinking of."
,William Keller II,2007-09-26T03:05Z,"The third one can be found at http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/3817104/Resident.Evil.Extinction.CAM.XViD-mVs.3817104.TPB.torrent
I DLed it already "

Great DVD Rip

For some unknown reason JetAudio didn't play this. But Windows Media Player, VLC player, DivX player played this.

Got nice speed
