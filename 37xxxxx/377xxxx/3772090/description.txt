This is an NES emulator + ~125 games. Works great I've been using this for years and decided I should share it. 

Only 15 megs!

As soon as you unzip it, just open nester.exe and go to FILE and OPEN ROM. Navigate over to the newly opened folder, click one of the .rom files and voila. Controls are under options/controllers.

Have fun! :)
