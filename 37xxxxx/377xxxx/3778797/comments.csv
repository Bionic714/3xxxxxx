Could it be the video drivers?

but for people interested in buying a new cheap video card look into getting a 8600 gt or gts..typically go for under $150 DX10 card that should be able to play this on low high settings...like no sorta high resolution and high/mid settings mostly high since an 8800 can play this max the next card up from the 8600. The card comes in XXX editions which are OC'd by the factory and the fatality edition card...supposed to equal a 8800 i hear..but not sure. 

i hope to be playing this demo tonight. dling it right now. "
,123yas,2007-08-20T23:36Z,so i have to dissapoint u coz 8600 is far far away behind 8800 ever OC and if u are gonna buy new card spend some extra pounds and buy 8800 gts even 320 mb in some cases 8600 is outperformed by 7900 :) in mid-edge cards nvidia and ati dont have nothining good in their offerts and dx10 in this case doesnt have nothing to do if u will have to lower ur resoluction to 640x480 i doubt that anyone would see difference in this resolution between dx9 and dx10 :) dont be fooled :)by the way if u read some forumes u can read that so far people havent seen anything impresive in dx10 (i hope crysis will change it) so far look like another trick from microsoft along with 'games for windows' :)
,saskuatch,2007-08-21T00:21Z,"^^^doesn't realize the dx10 is totally different then dx9 and that the mid range 8600 and 2600 were designed for dx10 not really with dx9 performance in mind, so naturally 7900's will beat them for now when there are no real dx10 based games out yet.....I think this is gonna change with bioshock"

""YOU MUST BE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET IN ORDER TO INSTALL THE GAME....Some internet security software may detect this download as a Trojan or other compromisation of internet security. ""
Anyway, I tried to run the setup and I got ""Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file name. You may not have the permissions to access this file"". I tried changing the permissions on it but it still doesn't work. Any  idea why?"
,AnthonyP2003,2007-08-22T13:41Z,"I downloaded this from FileFront also and it has the same trojan.  I'm curious if the demo released by the publisher was infected since I actually bought the real game and was unable to find this ""virus"" anywhere on the game disc or on my system after a full scan after installation.

@tumander - My system was not previously infected; I scan every single morning and had no infections until I installed this demo."
,CaptMidnight,2007-08-22T13:44Z,"i learned 5 things from this torrent.

1. the demo kicks ass
2. ppl are capping their upload speed
3. some people mistake the torrent for a trojan
4. theres some http mirrors with the demo
5. going to start calling people drones at work, ""no you fucking drone!"" lol"

Google for biochock demo avg Generic.um6 and you will see that many people have found that *the most recent update* to AVG (in the last week or so) false-positives many installation programs, this demo's setup.exe included. It's been reported to Grisoft."

The Generic6.ums ""virus"" detected by AVG yesterday was a definitely a false positive, caused by yesterday's update to virus definitions.  

AVG have since updated their definitions, and with today's ""priority update"" the setup.exe should no longer be detected as a trojan."

,trichome,2007-08-26T23:34Z,"yeah guys AVG is the AV for people who dont do shit like DL torrents and warez. Get a few different scanners and report all of the findings, not just one freebie scanner (which u should get Avast if all u want is free protection). Look around on here, I want to see a NOD32 scan, Kaspersky etc. Otherwise STFU with this virus bullshit. I run this demo on High (the slider to the right at high) at 800x600 and it stays right around 45fps even raping mofos with Plasmids. Rig. Ath. 64 3700, ATI x1600pro 256mb AGP, 2gb DC DDR400 on an ASROCK 939 Dual VSTA and a  SAT3 HD. Games spectacular. Seems they did optimize this for use on mid-range systems.
