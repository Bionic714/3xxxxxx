The audio completely cuts out midway through the first file, and the video is very choppy. I tried watching in GOM, WMP, Winamp, all had the same problem. I tried to import to Vegas and Sequoia to extract the audio stream. In both cases, the audio stream was considerably shorter than the video stream. This torrent should really just be deleted."
