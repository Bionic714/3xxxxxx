,Sunduc,2007-09-05T23:44Z,Any chance of making it a high-quality AVI?

,Chimairo,2007-10-04T04:06Z,"thx 
im huge fan of Hayao Miyazaki."
,technimac,2007-11-15T01:25Z,"Thanks for this great upload!
Every version that has Japanese and English audio always has French too, so is there any chance that this one also has the French audio track?  
The reason I ask is because Jean Reno voices Porco and Miyazaki is reported to have said that this was his favorite version of the film."
,PaulBunyan,2007-11-21T20:11Z,I'll definetely put this to my other computer on 10/10M line and keep seeding this.
,azitromax,2007-11-24T07:44Z,How do i convert this into an iso file? Ideas anyone?
,azitromax,2007-11-27T21:25Z,ok.. no ideas?
,Egal,2007-11-30T09:53Z,"Nope, I tried it myself a bunch of times but didn't succeed... so I figured, better put it here as an NRG than not do it at all, and perhaps somebody else would do it if they found it necessary."
,guillito,2008-08-27T17:03Z,YEAHHHHH!! ''Any chance of making it a high-quality AVI? '' PLEASE !!
,LezDawson,2008-11-16T18:33Z,"Many thanks Egal, the NRG file was perfect for me.  I'm not sure why you found it so hard to convert to ISO, since Nero can save images in ISO format, but hey, no problemo!
I took your DVD rip and I made a quality AVI rip, with Japanese and English audio, and English soft subs.  Get it here:

Thanks again to Egal :)"
,Uroojinator,2010-03-14T00:43Z,"Hey, does anyone know of any other .avi uploads for this? The link Lez gave does not exist."
,NuNu12,2012-02-26T06:41Z,"Thank you so much! The spoken and texted language is as described; I'm glad to have a copy of this film with BOTH English and Japanese audio and text!

,asleep42,2012-04-09T18:58Z,"Wish that link was still active LezDawson, I'd really love both the English and Japanese audio and subs, but .nrg files are such a faff. Shame this isn't available in .avi or something VLC can play."
