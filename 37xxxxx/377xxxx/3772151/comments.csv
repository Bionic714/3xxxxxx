Great site for subs! All languages!"
,naggi69,2007-08-14T02:17Z,"You might have to wait a while for subs to Die Hard 4.0 , but its only a matter of time until someone makes them in your language."

,bullvard,2007-08-30T08:02Z,"Nice torrent just what I need, But can you give me the original name of these .avi files so I know what subs I am gonna download"
,naggi69,2007-08-30T22:29Z,"bullvard, im not quite sure i remember, but when i downloaded them they had the subtitles included in english, and the torrent name at the time was ""die hard rips"" and I dont think i renamed the .avi:s but as i said im not sure.. of course you can try and download the subtitles to different rips and see wich one fits, and then post here wich one is the correct 

as for the die hard 4.0 it was named:

Live.Free.Or.Die.Hard.4.(2007).DVDRip.XviD-SoLAR.avi  

I know how annoying it is to download loads of wrong subtitles, i know, i spent last weekend trying to find correct subs to a movie.

But the good thing about Die Hard series is that you really dont need to know what say :D its the action that counts :D"

After you download the subtitles you unrar the package, and in there is a file witch ends in .srt

So when you open the video in VLC player, you just drag and drop the .srt file into the VLC window."
