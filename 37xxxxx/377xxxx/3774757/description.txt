-------------------------------Beginners Hacking Tools-----------------------------

*Contains everything* From remote admin tools (Trojans/RAT\\\'s), to port scanners, annominus surfers, etc...

I will not be held responsible for what ever actions you do with this software, i am seeding this for EDUCATIONAL purposes.

I recommend to use Poison Ivy, because it is still not detected by alot of the other Anti virus company\\\'s. 

***Please note***, depending on your anti virus, you might get false virus alerts, because these ARE hacking tools, no other reason, i seed CLEAN files.
