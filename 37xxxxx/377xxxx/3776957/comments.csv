,tomtomx,2007-08-18T21:59Z,That description of judaism's goals is about as relevant as the one you'd get about christianity if you interviewed a redneck christian TV-preacher...

,tomtomx,2007-08-19T22:06Z,So? A rabbi isn't anything like a pope or a bishop. A rabbi doesn't dictate or write laws. He's just another person.
,tomtomx,2007-08-20T20:23Z,"WTF! Downloaded this. Has nothing to do with the description. It's just a collection af lots of anti-semitic audiofiles and a compilation of anti-semitic videos. (You know, the kind that claims that jews eat small children etc.)
Pure neonazi nonsense!"
,tomtomx,2007-08-20T22:19Z,"BTW ""The American Board of Rabbis"" isn't what it sounds like. It's a small organisation of about 100 jewish fundamentalists. The jewish equivalence to redneck christan white supremacist KKK priests. (And about as relevant to traditional judaism as the others are to christianity. )"
,angryheathen,2008-11-16T01:05Z,"Sayanim is like most muslims.
He is a Jew hating racist.
Islam is a racist ideology and the muslims are the new Nazi's of today.
If you give them the opportunity they will finish what Hitler started. They are already trying with their suicide attacks in Israel."
