Are the files corrupt? What did the rest of you use to unzip?"
[T],Malekay,2007-08-15T03:15Z,"AndyRattlehead: google "".rar"". 
Download and install the software. 
Press ONE of the .RAR file and follow instructions."
,AndyRattlehead,2007-08-15T08:35Z,"Thanx - but it is not for lack of trying -  I have tried both Winzip and Winrar (v 3.7).

""The archive is either in unknown form or damaged"". 

Since this was the case with every single Friday the 13th-movie I downloaded I guess I thought that perhaps anyone else got the same problem. 

Have you downloaded and unziped without problems?"
,AndyRattlehead,2007-08-15T10:41Z,"I FIXED IT :)

For some reason bitcomet said the downloads were 100% but I restarted and found that they were between 94%-99%. I have now finished it and unziped properly. 

Thanx for the help though! :)"
