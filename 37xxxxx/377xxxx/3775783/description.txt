Plot: Directed by Richard Benjamin and inspired by incidents from comedy legend Mel Brooks' early career, 'My Favorite Year' is a Golden Age revisited, a zany, misty-eyed tribute to TV's early days. Academy Award┬½ nominee Peter O'Toole plays Swann. Once a swashbuckling movie idol whose face was plastered on fan magazines, Swann is now mostly plastered. And it falls to 'Cavalcade's' rookie writer (Mark Linn-Baker) to keep him on the sober and narrow. Don't touch that dial.
