(lol, still wondering where those Global X and UT EU X came from.. maybe WoZ?.. Did you donate finally? Oh no I forgot you're a truly pirate.. you steal stuff, yep that's right, steal, from WoZ.. LMAO @ u)

And 4X, because you are such a 'pirate', how come you spent money on newsgroups? THAT IS what I call 'Donate'... What a pirate you are ;-) *cough* 

Anyhow, thanks for the upload Hangar, and if you are smart enough, you'll hopefully find a way to contact me or get those things ;)"
,Sangeki,2007-08-15T23:06Z,Thank you!
,spiders96,2007-08-16T00:29Z,"What is up with all the sensitivity around WoZ?  What is wrong with taking files from one site and putting them on another site so that more people will get the copies?  Isn't that the way piracy works?  I've posted several files here, and a few on Demonoid, and I wouldn't be bothered at all if someone posted those files elsewhere.  Who cares, and what's the big deal?

Just curious why some people here get their ass bent out of shape for proliferating the piracy."
,flyboi708,2007-08-16T05:02Z,"@ spiders,
thas wat im sayin.

anyway, thanx fo the upload && the Ifly is out for FSX finally. anyone know where to get navdata for it tho?"
,The_Hangar_18,2007-08-16T08:02Z,"hmm,

global x i bought on release - and sold it on ebay ;)

and i donate ... nobody?

well, i have a externel hard drive with really all addons for fs9 and all you can get from the net for fsx.  hey, the reason why i share some stuff is, to do my little part to give a litte bit back into the web.

oh and buying some retail stuff, share it and sell it on ebay is not hard @ all lamers ;)

well, i want to share the airbus now..."
,Dr. Frikadel,2007-08-16T12:22Z,"The_Hangar_18.. What's wrong with you, didn't get laid recently?  Stop whining about 4X. He's not really different from you and me. Just as greedy..

Thanks for the upload!"
,4X-AXG,2007-08-16T16:32Z,"N37839290289JB,

who the fuck ever said I am paying for usenet access? in my country, the ISPs all have free newsserver access
and even if I was paying for the access, that would be totally different from donating to some old can't-get-my-dick-hard fart called Fergie, who proudly displays 'purchased by' and then neglects to tell he purchased a certain addon with others people money.

anyway..I have Dillingham and Phoenix as well..I guess there are some VIP members at WoShit who aren't as loyal as they seem to be hahaha"
,4X-AXG,2007-08-16T17:00Z,"oh and hangar, here's Brussels..it's for FS2004 though, no FSX version available yet

,goro_999,2007-08-17T19:00Z,"Is this only for the FSX version? 

I tried to install it for my FS2004 version, but it says that in can'T find a properly installed FSX version.

Thanks in advance."
