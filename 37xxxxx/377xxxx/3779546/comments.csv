,herne_hunter666,2007-08-27T19:59Z,"It's OS X 10.4.1

There is a much newer torrent here on the Pirate Bay, 10.4.7 -- you're better off using that one. And, for the poster who asked, yes you can just load the vmware image without installing OS X itself. "
,herne_hunter666,2007-08-27T20:00Z,"The link to the other torrent, 10.4.7 is as follows:

,d06omtas,2007-10-24T16:42Z,"It can't be 10.4.1, as it was posted quite recently, and there is no intel version of 10.4.1, only 10.4.6 or above. "

When I try load this in VMWare 6, it just goies into a loop from the boot screen to a quick flash of what appears to be some sort of Apple.  Anyone else having this problem, or can someone offer me some ideas? 
Thanks...."
,aeroseth,2007-11-11T14:57Z,"Unless your CPU supports SSE2 or SSE3 don't count on this running, Even in VMWare, even with Pear, or any emulator. This means unless you have a Pentium4 or Athlon 64 you are SOL."
,jont51,2007-11-11T20:50Z,"Thx for the reply.
Based on CPUZ, I have;
Instruction sets	MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, EM64T....
If anyone else has this problem and somehow gets around it, could you please let me know?
I am thinking of buying a Mac Mini anyway, but would like to play around with this 1st to see if it's worth the $$$$. (I know it won't be 'exactly' the same, but I'll get the idea)...
Thanks......"
,CptFastbreak,2007-11-29T17:47Z,"2herne & tippy:
I think that other torrent you are referring to works only for Intel CPUs. I have an Athlon64, and this image works fine, while the other one did not boot properly."
,Markstar.PB,2007-12-19T13:46Z,"@CptFastbreak: Yep, I have the same problem. This one works (and it is 10.4.1) while the other one doesn't. :("

,bb_slayer,2008-09-20T18:29Z,Do not waste your time downloading it. As someone stated before this restarts the VMM in a loop once the apple bootloader kicks in. I do have a C2D with SSE2/SS3.

You did a perfect job.
