,pongfaen,2007-09-29T01:14Z,"rascelon: that is because ripping dvd's are forbiden in many countries therfore many sites does not want to have the download. And furthermore; DVD Shrink can copy any DVD, and all of you that does not get it to work, you are a bunch of stupid noobs, that shoud get some of your mates (if you have aone) do download and burn for you! So don't complain about this app, and burn in hell!"
,purplepants35,2007-12-30T18:26Z,dvd shrink will back up any dvd that is cracked by anydvd just download a working cracked version of anydvd and no problem and dvd fag sucks big time when it shrinks a dvd-9 to fit on a dvd-5 the resulting video quality is the worst ive seen in any program i recomend staying away from dvd fag i use anydvd to crack the protection and either dvd shrink nero or clonedvd to shrink and to burn i use clonedvd or nero dvd shrink creates the best quality or so it apears that way for me
