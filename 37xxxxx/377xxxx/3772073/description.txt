==My Message==
Part of living life to the full is getting the most out of your time... This audio book is the perfect way to learn a language without using up any time. Put this on your mp3 player and listen to it when you're cleaning, using transport, exercising... anything that doesn't require any thought. You're meant to say the French out loud but it also works pretty well saying it in your head (but you can't just listen!)

Don't stop there... there's 1000s of useful audio books- I can get them for free because I work in a library. I'm going to make as many as possible into torrents. I'll try to add one every week.

another good thing about this course is that it?s split into short lessons of 5-10 minutes. What I do is listen to a playlist that alternates between chilled out music and learning French. That way I don't work my brain too hard.

==Live longer==
I used to sleep for 8.25 hours per night... thats pretty average. Then I read that its recommended that we sleep 6-8 hours, so i thought why not sleep for 6? That way i can spend more time awake. I gain 2.25 hours per day... thats 17.75 hours in a week, which is exactly the same amount of time i used to spend awake when i slept for 8.25 hours a night. Its like having an extra day a week for the rest of your life!

it takes a couple of days to get used to, but after it does it you feel more alert. You get lucid dreams as well! If you find it hard to get up, try getting in the habit of going for a 10 minute jog as soon as you awake. It wakes you up and sets you up for the morning!

==One Last thing==
I can't seed this torrent forever... please don't destroy my torrent by taking without seeding.


peace and love guys and girls, keep it real
