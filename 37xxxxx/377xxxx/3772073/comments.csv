,Hal440,2007-08-13T23:45Z,"heh- i copied the book description straight from someones ""learn spanish with michael thomas"" torrent... so where it says 'spanish' it should say 'french'

Just to confirm- this is for learning french."
,saunapirat,2007-08-14T00:39Z,"I have this one and itÂ´s great!

Michel is a very special man and itÂ´s a very special course and his pronounciation is not the best. 

But he WILL teach you french faster than ever.

I promise!

Looking forward to see what will come next :)

Merci beaucoup!

,yournudeteens,2007-11-16T23:10Z,I will seed this on my dedicated server so we will all get faster downloads. I hope this is as good as you say it is :)
,mosstrooperuk,2008-03-21T10:20Z,This is an excellent product. They have now produced an updated version which has a revision disk in it that excludes the students efforts (who can be irritating when you listen to the course more than twice). Does any one have the revision disk? Will you please seed it if you have? Many thanks.

,callmecandy,2008-07-01T18:33Z,this is not a good way to learn french. the guy hasn't even got a good accent. take a class instead.

,ewokmuff,2009-05-11T17:27Z,"Great seeding, people. Cheers for the download Hal440!"
,freeway89,2011-04-18T20:56Z,"This is imo really bad, the guy his voice is very annoying to listen to. i'd let this one slide"
,keesssie,2011-05-04T13:32Z,"This guy's voice is really annoying.
and for people who are bit more advanced he is not french and has an accent.
And besides that, the guy takes an half an hour to explain that it is his job to teach and some other crab before he begins with the lesson, (who suck anyway!! sorry) "
,no-name09,2011-06-19T16:17Z,"thanks,i have learn english with Michel Thomas "
,MAGIC_HATE_BALL,2011-09-21T07:42Z,"I just finished this and I can't believe how fast I'm picking up & speaking French.  I hope Hal and other people put out more of Michel Thomas teachings.   This is far & away the easiest way to learn a language.  

Well done Hal!"
