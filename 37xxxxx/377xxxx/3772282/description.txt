F4CG overnight, released WinMount 2.0.3, which comes with a patch to patch the program. This program claims to be revolutionary in the way it handles ZIP and RAR archives. Rather then decompressing them, it mounts them onto a virtual drive to allow you to view them. (Is it just me, or does mounting them to a drive sound like a lot of hassle, and wouldn?t it be the same as decompressing them?). Anyway give this one a try if your looking for an alternative to DAEMONS TOOLS, or Alcohol 120%.

WinMount is a powerful windows utility which is dedicated to managing compressed archives and image files impressively and conveniently. It can be used to mount ZIP, RAR, ISO, etc. archives very fast, which enables you to use the files inside directly without needing extract beforehand. Such convenience, therefore, saves you time and disk space dramatically. In addition, WinMount, serving as a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM emulator, supports almost all image file formats, which includes, but not limited to, ISO, CUE/BIN, CCD,BWT, MDS, CDI, NRG, PDI B5T and ISZ.
