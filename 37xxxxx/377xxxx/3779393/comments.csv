,DEC_42,2008-04-04T20:37Z,"Well, after about an hour, I sat down to watch what was supposed to be a hilarious movie. I was deeply disappointed as I found that the video and audio was out of sync any time the video held up and then sped up. Don't waste your time with this.

Movie: 4/5
Video: 3/5 (I'd rate lower, but this was from '74)
Audio: 1/5

Overall Torrent Rating: 2/5



(Note, rating of the movie itself doesn't affect overall rating. Overall rating not necessarily an average of Video and Audio)"
