,coiken,2007-08-15T11:51Z,"djees, damn all you hit and runners!

Only one seeder, nobody else finished downloading it or did they all run away?
speed is terrible atm 0.1kb/s

Thanks for the upload!"
,ParagonFV,2007-08-15T17:57Z,Is this the preload from fileplanet?
,absence2,2007-08-16T06:27Z,"this is ridiculous. it's been days and not one person has fully downloaded this file and the full game now has a torrent with over a dozen seeders already. 

let this be a warning to anyone who tried to upload a file of >1GB when their naff ISP won't let them upload more than 50kbps."
