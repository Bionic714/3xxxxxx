,Six_66,2011-11-25T20:27Z,"Doesn't work for me. Splash screen loads and then it crashes to desktop. Log file says it can't find 'base:UI/Game' files. So I copied those files to the root directory. Still crashes to desktop after the intro video. 

Is there a fix for this?"
,Six_66,2011-11-25T22:40Z,"Correction: It does work. My issue was that I had k-lite codecs. XP  users, look in your Start Menu under All Programs for a K-Lite category. Uninstall it. 
FIXED!"
