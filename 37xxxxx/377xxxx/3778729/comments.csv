End of suburbia is NOT about conspiracies, it is about PEAK OIL. 
For once take some time and educate yourself. 

If you understand PeakOil, you will however also understand why the war on terror (started with 911) is most likely a grab for oil (and control of territory where there is oil) and the importance of this for USA.

Although I believe you are too much of an crack pot to take the effort to DL the movie and watch it (while not being high)."

This is NOT a 911 conspiracy, it has nothing to do with idiots like alex jones, the world is probably faceing nuclear war within 50 years, and thats generous."

How can you claim to have an understanding of this when you are still ignorant of cannabis? Go research weed instead of making naive comments like ""stop smoking so much pot."""
