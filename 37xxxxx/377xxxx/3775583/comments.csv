,NO_BS,2007-09-14T08:00Z,"I just ran out of weed... Fuck...

I'm not a dope fiend, but I really want to be high right now. I have to resort to alcohol instead, and that sucks. I'm not a big drinker anymore.

I quit smoking, too, so weed was really the only thing I had to satisfy my desire to smoke something... 

Just had to complain for a bit. That is all."

,fizzbanthemagician,2009-01-03T13:18Z,"To fix the crash on startup I did the following:

1) disabled all extra screens
2) set the resolution of the main screen to 1024x768
3) started fsw2
4) set the video options and exit
5) put everything back the way it was.
6) fsw2 now starts properly with some extra resolutions on higher res screens.
