,chimneypot,2007-10-09T18:22Z,"Thanks, Man, I'm there.  I snagged the decoding over at digitaldistractions a while back.  Thanks for the heads up for btjunkie."
,chimneypot,2007-10-11T04:22Z,"yeah, I snagged it but can't get it to mount on my mac 10.3.9.  F**K...I gotta fool with some alt expanders for rar.  Maybe I'll try expanding & burning on windows then play on mac.  I'm stoked to actually have it though."
