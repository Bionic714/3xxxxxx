Music : Soul : MP3/192Kbps
Way back in the 70's. we had Earth, Wind & Fire - War - Santana, And then we had MANDRILL! This group of Soul & Latino brothers, made music just as good as any others. I still listen to them today. Here is my collection of Mandrill's music. It took a while to find them all, but other than thier recenty Cd's, this collection I'm proud to say is complete. If you're into 70's funk, then check out Mandrill. They are best know for "Symphonic Revolution & Central Park" One of my favorite is " I Refuse To Smile" from Mandrill Is. Let me know if you dig. Peace
