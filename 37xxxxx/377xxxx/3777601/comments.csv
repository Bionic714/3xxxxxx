,picky_micke,2007-09-10T19:31Z,"rayjay! glad you liked it! apparently there were quite a few songs in the film that were left out on the soundtrack. trying to track those down and will upload them once they're complete.

meanwhile, you seem like a collector of disco music. you wouldn't know where to find Gary Byrd and the GB Experience - The Crown?

I love that song so much, as it is a piece of who I was growing up! And it brought back sooo many memories. Again thank you so much, NO ONE has this music it seems but us now, LOL."

Mandrill was truly one of the best...Recently, I googled mandrill and found some old Soul Train and In Concert videos on Youtube. If you haven't already, check them out. It's awe inspiring They were such an extraordinary live performance band. Again, thanks! "
