     Release Notes:



     At Superbad's infancy the combination of 60's-70's

     Funk, R&B, and even Blaxploitation, had already been

     established for the film's musical makeup as written

     by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. The producer and

     director, Judd Apatow and Greg Motolla loved the

     juxtaposition of these two white high school kids and

     this funky music; it just worked on a myriad of

     levels. The composer, Lyle Workman and music

     supervisor, Jonathan Karp agreed that the original

     music be as authentic as possible in order to sound as

     soulful and greasy as the songs and score music that

     had been temped in as inspiration. This path toward

     authenticity dictated that the musicians were the

     originators and innovators -- the most influential

     names synonymous with Funk. With sights set on soul

     royalty, the team set out going after the alumni of

     James Brown's band. Bootsy Collins, Mr. Brown's

     groundbreaking bassist before joining George Clinton

     and Parliament Funkadelic, was the first on board.

     Nabbed next was the funkiest of funky drummers, Clyde

     Stubblefield and John "Jab'o" Starks, both heard on

     Mr. Brown's most popular songs. Adding Phelps

     "Catfish" Collins on guitar and keyboard genius Bernie

     Worrell, the dream band had been assembled. Because

     they had not seen each other in years, the spirit in

     the studio was very much a family reunion and

     something to behold. In the end, what was achieved

     from this joyous congregation far exceeded the

     expectations.
