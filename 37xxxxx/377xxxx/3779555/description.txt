       DESCRIPTION 
       ~~~~~~~~~~~ 
       Like previous Ricochet games, Ricochet Infinity has been created with 
       community in mind, enabling gamers to create and share levels with 
       other players all over the world. Unlike previous Ricochet games, 
       players can now download, rate and tag new levels without ever 
       leaving the game. Unique to Ricochet Infinity, this new ability to 
       directly download levels from within the game makes it easier than 
       ever before for players to trade levels. Players will be able to watch 
       and see the levels they create climb through the ranks of the most 
       downloaded levels, and perhaps become the next online sensation.
