Synopsis	A woman mysteriously disappears on an uninhabited island after 
                arguing with her boyfriend, impelling him and her friend to look 
                for her. Subtle, incisive allegory of spiritual and moral decay 
                makes for demanding viewing. Antonioni's first international 
                success was also the first of a trilogy (followed by "La Notte" and 
                "L'Eclisse"). From Leonard Maltion's Movie Guide.
