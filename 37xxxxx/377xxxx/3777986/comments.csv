,wilbymilstone,2007-08-19T09:37Z,I am writing my own comment. This torrent is all in pdf format and complete. It even has a D&D soundtrack for role playing. Amazing collection. Plus I seeded for all.
,wilbymilstone,2007-08-19T09:55Z,"An addition to previous comment, Credit to Akronsire for his hard work in compiling the original torrent. I added about 60 files to the original. Everyone enjoy!!"

,Rolandthegreat,2007-09-10T03:19Z,All of the files seem to be corrupted. If anyone could help me I'd appreciate it.
,wilbymilstone,2007-09-12T00:10Z,"ronaldthegreat, you can only open the files that are completed. Until then, the computer will say that they are corrupt. Finish the download then open the files."
,ashleyspop,2007-09-12T04:06Z,THX very much it looks awsome
,netfoo,2008-03-31T02:51Z,Could you please post what files are included in this torrent?
,F4R207,2008-04-11T00:39Z,"Excellent! But.. Ehm.. If any one has any of the 
Paizo (Pathfinder, Runelords, Gamemastry and 
so on) D20, D&D, stuff to post/seed? Please do.

The little of it I have read it looks like they write
 some great stuff and for me, most of all, has some
 great inspirational art. :)

Thanks!

,TAAH,2008-12-30T18:01Z,Is everyone seeding this on a dialup or something? 4KB down but over 100KB up for 2 weeks. WTF? Take the upload limit off.
,outcast58,2009-01-03T20:19Z,"Don't know if anybody is still replying to posts, but these .pdf files are very small in comparison to others (Beasiary of Krynn, for example, is 40-ish mb on other torrents, but only 6.4 mb on this torrent.)  Any particular reason why?"
,Athaniel,2009-03-26T18:16Z,"If some more seeders hop on that would be greaaat.

:P

I will seed this for a week when I get it."
,Reegdor,2009-05-31T12:11Z,"     Amazing, two thumbs way up, at first I was having a problem where all the files were corrupt... until I read Rolandthegreat's and Wilbymilstone's comments. xD. Thanks a whole lot, no viruses, nothing but pure, hardcore DnD! (The ""Book of Erotic Fantasy"" is a nice addition!!)
     This is a must have for any DnD'er, I will for sure be seeding this for a long time, my thanks to you, Wilbymilstone, and to the aforementioned Akronshire!"
,Wookieboy,2009-07-09T10:09Z,2 seeders.. awsome! it will only take a week and a half to dl.. lol. 
,Lig3ia,2010-01-18T08:08Z,"please please please seed

so please please please seed"
,SLVBros,2010-04-15T10:08Z,Once it finishes I'll seed when possible
,Draden,2010-11-27T08:34Z,Is this the content for 4th edition or earlier? I don't really want to download such a large file to find out it's become obsolete.
,mtvgnoll2,2010-12-20T11:40Z,"This is a huge and cool stuff, since i loath and despise 4e. Thanx an awful lot.  I don't think i will be able to seed it all but ill try. My pc is on a wireless public network. Id like some gurps and d&d 1st and 2nd ed books, so if you know a torrent please let me know."
