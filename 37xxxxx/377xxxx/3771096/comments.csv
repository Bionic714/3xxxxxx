,Panodilo,2007-08-12T21:46Z,Loved the old one. Will give this one a look see. Thanks
,Kronocide,2007-10-13T11:12Z,"OMG, this is one of my favorite movies of all time. Easily the best adaption of Stevenson, and the best pirate movie. I only own it on an NTSC-tape that I can't play anymore, and I've been waiting for ages for it to show up here. I really hope you seed it until I have all of it, then I promise to seed it forever. :-)"

,HimThatWierdGuy,2010-11-05T03:36Z,"Better pirate acting you will never stumble upon.
GIV' ME MOAR ROM!"
,scalpar,2011-04-23T13:35Z,"quality is quite bad.
v-4, a-6"
,michaelrwatson,2012-01-08T00:01Z,"Weellll....quite bad is an exaggeration. It ain't a DVDrip, but is more like a TVrip or a laserdisc rip. Video res is 560x416 (4:3 A/R). The audio is essentially perfect but with slight scratchiness here and there, like an old record. Thanks!

,Kasterbater,2012-04-02T03:00Z,"Why are pirates so mean?

...they just ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRE!!!"
,1220,2012-08-15T22:44Z,"Compared to the totally ruined 2012 version... THIS. IS. AWESOME.

The new one sucks big time; poor camera work and acting, terrible choice of actors, changed plot, etc."
