Please help me seed if you snag it.  Thanks!"
,jtegnell,2007-10-20T06:39Z,"Nobody is seeding this unfortunately...

Please oh please oh please oh please put up some full episodes of the TV show! This was truly the best show on the tube while it was running!

I will gladly help seed them!"
,KaitlynDancer,2007-11-12T01:52Z,"I don't have a very reliable internet connection and I usually turn off the computer when I go to bed, otherwise though, I am seeding this whenever I can so just leave it open and you should be able to download it!

A number of people have grabbed this, which is good, but I would appreciate it if some other people would seed it please.  If you download, please seed it for awhile.  It is a low traffic torrent so if you leave it open for a while you shouldn't notice it eating up much bandwidth.  Thanks.

I did a VHS rip of all the shows, I have been waiting to order the DVD versions (they made DVDs with 88 of the 91 original episodes) but haven't yet.  If there is a particular episode you want, let me know and I will put it up!  All of them together are too much (12GB) for just a VHS rip.  "
,jtegnell,2007-12-08T08:51Z,"Wow! I'd love it if you could put any episode up. I promise to seed it as long as I can! 

Whatever your favorite episode(s) is/are would be great.

The ones I fondly remember are the waterbug one and the big wet rodent one. But they're all great, and there are certainly quite a few I haven't seen.

Anything at all you put up is appreciated."
,jtegnell,2008-01-31T13:31Z,"Please, Kaitlyn, please!

Please post some episodes!

Pretty please? With sugar on top?"
,Trueill,2008-12-12T15:24Z,Please Seed it
,jtegnell,2009-01-26T12:34Z,"Kaaaaaaaaaaaaitlyn!

What happened to this?

You know, you'd make my day big time if you put some episodes up."
