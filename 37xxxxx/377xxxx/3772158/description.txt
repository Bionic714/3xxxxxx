These are the Music Videos from the "John Acorn The Nature Nut" TV series.  This
is all 91 of the original videos ripped from the VHS tapes.  I apologize for the
occasional low quality due to the source.

The Nature Nut series is simply the best nature show in the world.  John Acorn
uses his intelligence, passion, and humour to explore nature in a way that is 
delightful and captivating.  Great for kids, university students, and adults, he opens
the world of nature to us.  Each episode of the TV series contained a music video,
written and performed by John Acorn and his team, which are at once beautiful,
hilarious, campy, cute, and ingenious.  Don't miss this.

These are the Music Videos only, not the full episodes.  I am also releasing
the complete episodes as well so keep your eyes open. 

If you have never seen The Nature Nut, I recommend "Flies of Every Kind", "Wasps, 
Ants, and Society in General", "Butterfiles and Flutterbys", or "Exploring 
Monster Legends".
