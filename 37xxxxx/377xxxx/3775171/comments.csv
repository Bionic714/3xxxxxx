,Gaeia,2011-05-28T00:32Z,"For everyone waiting for seeds: You are not alone, I know how it feels. I promise, of all my heart, to seed AS LONG AS I CAN when this is done! As long as my router still stands, I'll seed. Shame on those who don't! Support the torrents you really enjoy, don't just do a ""hit n' run"". Despicable.

(ALSO, I will probably seed alot on different torrents on seasons up to Shippuden.)"
