,Monkeyduff,2007-08-21T00:28Z,"I just stopped the original and started this torrent.

Looks like its down in a couple of minutes :D"
,KaWum,2007-08-21T00:46Z,"I got it, thanks anyway :-)"
[T],Lizav,2007-08-21T03:11Z,"Re-Check
is a context menu >> Re-Check hash .torrent "
,zip1920,2007-08-21T03:21Z,"Why not download.?? Of course we can download this torrent. Only the guys who was downloading the other corrupted torrent needs to do the recheck option.

If you are downloading this for the first time, just get this one. There is no reason to start downloading the corrupted hash torrent. This torrent have a nice number of leechers and seeders.

Who downloaded this, please, write a comment for those who are interested about this torrent. Is it good? Is it a hot stuff? Is it THE torrent?"

,frost4242,2007-08-23T02:55Z,why won't it let me download it. try to download with azureus?
,viewsonic9,2007-08-23T02:56Z,HeatMiseR25 you have downloaded the corrupt torrent. Keep the files and click on download this torrent. It will pick up from 94% and finish it.
,frost4242,2007-08-23T03:07Z,When i click on download it tells me it can not find server. Or in Azureus it can not find file. someone please help.
,viewsonic9,2007-08-23T16:51Z,frost4242 is it doing the same with other torrents as well? The first thing I would suggest is uninstall Azureus then reinstall it and try again..

,JewishDan18,2007-08-28T20:34Z,"it all works great, except the onLocation.  It gave me a trial version, and theres no way to validate it (as far as I can tell).  Any ideas?"
,tmadman,2007-08-29T01:10Z,"Works great. thnx for the up

I have only one question, does anyone know how to get the missing content (for example the objects in Encore) that adobe removed from the trial?"
,mrtjompa,2007-08-30T09:24Z,Can someone verify that this one works?
,viewsonic9,2007-08-31T03:05Z,"@ tmadman. Open a program, go into 'help' and then 'updates'. If you didnt have the Encore extras I imagine they will download in that. Having said that I thought the version of Encore on this was complete.

@ mrtjompa. Yes it does.
"
,firsttimers,2007-09-01T01:14Z,I finished downloading. It says 100% complete. But on the status bar its says can't move. Can someone help with that?  I've been looking everywhere but no answers yet....
,viewsonic9,2007-09-01T22:13Z,@ firsttimers. Go into options and find out where on your PC the file is downloading to. The torrent will be in there. 
,revered0ne,2007-09-02T04:17Z,firsttimers..I'm assuming you're trying to 'move' the file to a different dir....if you're bit torrent client is still open chances are you're now SEEDING this torrent....which is much appreciated....but if you must move the file you have to close your torrent client first so nothing is accessing the file. Also chances are the file is located in the mydocuments/downloads folder...

,viewsonic9,2007-09-04T00:41Z,@ Heyward. Have you actually tried uninstalling and then reinstalling?
,mrtjompa,2007-09-05T13:34Z,"Hi,

I have downloaded this one to a friend. Now she asks me how to install/crack It. Could someone explain in some short sentence. Can´t find any .nfo-file either...

Please.

(I´m an Mac user myself)"
,mrtjompa,2007-09-06T00:17Z,Anyone?
,stagehand86,2007-09-07T00:07Z,Absolutely fantastic! Works like a charm. Thanks for sharing!
,viewsonic9,2007-09-07T01:22Z,"@ mrtjompa.

When you open a program after installation it will ask you to activate online. Choose the option to activate another way and choose to do it by phone (you are not going to do this however). 

You will then be presented a number to give to the person over the phone and asked for the activation number they will give back to you.

Open the keygen again and copy the number you are given into it and press generate. It will then give you the activation number to input.

I believe it will then ask you if you now want to register online. Tell it to never do that. I don't know if doing so will fuck it up but you never know. 

This all worked for me and I have also been able to download all of the updates with no ill effects."
,viewsonic9,2007-09-07T01:27Z,"@ mrtjompa again.

Sorry I should have pointed out that to install it in the first place you simply follow all the on screen instructions and when it asks you for the serial number just open the keygen and click generate to produce one.

You also have to mount the file in a virtual drive using a program like Daemon tools in order for the PC to think it is a real disk."
,viewsonic9,2007-09-07T01:32Z,"@ Heyward

There is actually a solution to this problem posted by Adobe themselves on their site (how nice of them lol)

""If you did not receive any errors during installation, then perform these steps in the order given. 

1. For an incomplete installation, follow the steps in knowledgebase document kb401401 (Windows) or kb402151 (Mac OS).
If you received errors during installation, and you've never been able to open your CS3 application, then the installation is incomplete. Please follow the steps in Technote kb401401 (Windows) or Technote kb402151 (Mac OS).

2. Move or delete the cache.db file.
Move the cache.db file from the follwing locations, onto the desktop or another folder. You can delete this file, but if you do, you'll need to enter your serial number the next time you open your application. 

On Windows XP and Windows Vista, the cache.db file is located in Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe PCD\cache 
On Mac OS X, the cache.db file is located in Library/Application Support/Adobe/Adobe PCD/cache 
Try to open your Adobe application.

3. Move the Trusted Storage File (TSF) out of the FLEXnet folder.
Move the adobe_0080000.tsf.data file onto the desktop or to another safe location from the Documents and Settings/All Users/Application Data/FLEXnet folder (Windows XP), ProgramData\FLEXnet folder (Windows Vista), or the Library/Preferences/FLEXnet Publisher/FLEXnet folder (Mac OS). 

Important: Do not delete this file. 

Try opening your Creative Suite 3 application. If you still cannot open the application, then continue to the next step.

4. Rename the FLEXnet folder, under the appropriate folder.
Rename the Documents and Settings/All Users/Application Data/FLEXnet folder (Windows XP), the ProgramData\FLEXnet folder (Windows Vista), or the Library/Preferences/FLEXnet Publisher/FLEXnet folder (Mac OS), to \oldFLEXnet."""
,Lightning_Rider,2007-09-07T04:29Z,"viewsonic9, I did what you posted but it still doesn't work. After activating using the phone method, a message box comes up and says ""Licence has expired""

It appears it's the keygen that no longer works. Are there any other working keygens out there yet?"
,rottpung,2007-09-07T15:06Z,"try this keygen. Worked for me when installing this one:

Thanks! I´ll send your guide further... Creds."
,revered0ne,2007-09-08T04:21Z,HAS ANYONE gotten OnLocation to work as a full version as opposed to a 30day trial???
,revered0ne,2007-09-10T02:06Z,Well...i figured it out actually....this version of OnLocation is JUST the TRIAL...if you want to have it in full with its OWN KEYGEN...look for the Production Premium torrent....and just D/L the OnLocation iso....than you can activate it with the supplied keygen!!!
,revered0ne,2007-09-10T02:09Z,BTW....You can take care of any Encore issues you may have by D/L'n the Full Torrent..and installing Encore with their release....it also includes the Extra content (Encore CS3 library and Soundbooth Scores!!!)
,deathangel598,2007-10-26T04:19Z,"Can I get some more seeders on this, otherwise I'm going to be waiting for weeks, thanks a bunch."
,Techloid,2007-11-08T17:22Z,Does this version of master collection include the Encore library??? The master collection I downloaded did not include the library files.

,CaptainBeefheart314,2008-07-11T08:20Z,"There's a Trojan inside this .Torrent file, lucky for me I've still got AVG 8 to protect me => moved to the vault, no harm done. To everyone:

,El-Faggio,2011-04-06T22:11Z,"@CaptainBeefheart314

The reason it's telling you there is a trojan, is because you are using AVG. AVG is a terrible anti-virus and will tell you that anything which interacts with a couple of .dll files or modifies the running habits of a program is a virus. It will also tell you that a keygen is a virus because it thinks that just because something has a small database of code and a random generator, it too, is a virus. Get Norton 2011 Pro. I've only ever gotten a couple of false alarms, and those have good reason to be suspicious files..."

Norton is a PIECE OF SHIT that MISSES MANY REAL THREATS !!!"
,Pauper01,2012-04-04T09:33Z,"Also ... AVG is NOT a terrible Anti-virus prog ... Read the reviews of KNOWLEDGEABLE sites (cnet, Techweb, etc.) and you will find that AVG is one of THE BEST at catching and cleaning many types malicious threats.
El-Faggio is a moron, DON'T LISTEN TO HIM !!!"
