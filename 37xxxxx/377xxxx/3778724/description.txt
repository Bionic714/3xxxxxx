Here is, what looks to me, a very useful tool called Driver Magician. For the people that have never heard of it, Driver Magician can grab all your system drivers, and back them up where ever you like, so that when you format/lose everything, you can just restore your back up and not have to install all you drivers as well. Yay! You can also compare your drivers with their â??databaseâ?? to see if you have the latest versions of your drivers, but I think that feature may be open to abuseâ?¦ Anyway another fine release by CORE (As they sayâ?¦ ;) ) so check this one out!

Driver Magician offers a professional solution for device drivers backup, restoration, update and removal in Windows operating system. It identifies all the hardware in the system, extracts their associated drivers from the hard disk and backs them up to a location of your choice. Then when you format and reinstall/upgrade your operating system, you can restore all the â??savedâ?? drivers just as if you had the original driver diskettes in your hands. After one system reboot, your PC will be loaded and running with the required hardware drivers.

Program Features:

    * Back up device drivers of your computer in four modes.
    * Restore device drivers from backup in one mouse click.
    * Update device drivers of your PC to improve system performance and stability.
