London, Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels.  A European city bustles?it?s a hub of commerce and the arts, energy, surprise, and international flavor.  Where do you start if you have just 24-hours?  Here, we highlight some best choices of the urban culture in four great cities.  London calls for high tea at the Athenaeum and modern art at the New Tate.  Paris treats us to impressive dining, the Musee D?Orsay and the Pompidou.  Rembrandt?s The Night Watch and traditional rijsttafel dinner are mandatory in Amsterdam, and in 1000 year-old-Brussels, we land in what some call ?the most beautiful town square in Europe.?   Europe?s great cities stay with you.
