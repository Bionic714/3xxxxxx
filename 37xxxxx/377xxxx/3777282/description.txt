 Here, June Casagrande (so not your ninth grade English teacher) will reassure you that itÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s okay not to care about grammar. Just what you wanted to hear! But with humor and enthusiasm, she will show you how grammar can be fun and worth a little bit of your time. So, uncover your eyes and learn her lesson. This wonÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t hurt a bit

About the author:
June Casagrande was born in March and lives in a small house. She worked as an editor and community news reporter before launching the self-syndicated weekly grammar column, Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½A Word Please,Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ which appears in community newspapers in Southern California, Florida and Texas. She has written articles for a number of regional and national publications including the Los Angeles Times. June attended the University of South Florida, where she earned her bachelorÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s degree. She attended the improv comedy school at the renowned Groundlings Theatre, where she flunked out (much tougher program). June lives in Pasadena, Calif., with an embarrassing number of cats (four) and a just-right number of men (one). \"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies\" is her first book. She\'s currently working on her second Penguin grammar book, a look at the 101 most-criticized usage choices; the working title is \"Mortal Syntax.\"

-LEGAL TORRENTS

Purpose:

create a balance, share the already free stuff,
public domain works, freeware, free music,
free ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.

show the copyright owners that torrent
websites shouldn\'t bear the responsibility
of what their users upload, torrent websites
are very much similar to google..

users upload what they want to upload,
download what they want to download,
and search for what they want to search..

by creating this balance and sharing the already free
stuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..
