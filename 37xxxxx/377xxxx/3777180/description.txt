Language English
Notes

Educational leaders are seeing with increasing clearness the necessity of teaching students not only the subject-matter of study but also methods of study. The recognition of this condition is taking the form of the movement toward ''supervised study,'' which attempts to acquaint the student with principles of economy and directness in using his mind. It is generally agreed that there are certain ''tricks'' which make for mental efficiency, consisting of methods of apperceiving facts, methods of review, devices for arranging work. Some are the fruits of psychological experimentation; others are derived from experience. Many of them can be imparted by instruction, and it is for the purpose of systematizing these and making them available for students that this book is prepared.

Purpose:

create a balance, share the already free stuff,
public domain works, freeware, free music,
free ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.

show the copyright owners that torrent
websites shouldn't bear the responsibility
of what their users upload, torrent websites
are very much similar to google..

users upload what they want to upload,
download what they want to download,
and search for what they want to search..

by creating this balance and sharing the already free
stuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..
