One of the best manuals ever, It introduces the student to the Golden Dawn system of Magic (if not completely its mostly the Golden Dawn's). Very similar to Modern Magick, I don't know wich manual inspired wich, but they're almost identic. Some topics: QBL, Banishing Rituals, Meditations, Making of Talismans, among other things.

Hope it helps you
