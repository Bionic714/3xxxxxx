The contents of the LOTRO dvd disk but into iso format. It is the European Version. Can be used for anyone who has a buddy/friend key & requires to d/l the game or for anyone who lost their disks. 
Will not work for the American version.

Should work alright, I've not managed to install from it since I already have it installed but the thing mounts alright & launches.

Just use daemon or alcohol 120 to mount it.
