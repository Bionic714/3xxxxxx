From one classical nut to another...

This was originally a 35mm magnetic tape transfer to SACD using sonys fancy DSD technology. I used my new Oppo SACD player to dub it into a 24/96 (DVD-Audio) lossless FLAC file for everyone to enjoy! You will need the right hardware to play it, so if your soundcard isnt an Audigy or M-Audio or something else capable of playing a 96khz 24bit file, then sorry. But if it is, use Foobar2000 with the FLAC codec plugin (off their mainpage) to hear this in all of its Hi-Fidelity Glory! 

The 2nd movement is an all time favorite of mine!
