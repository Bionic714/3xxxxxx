,Rhum_Keeper,2007-12-06T12:55Z,"I Have an OPPO 981 HD. If I transfer the FLAC Files from other torrents and burn them to a DATA DVD the OPPO refuses it with ""Unknown disk"" message..
My question is . Do you know a way to burn a DVD (Data or Video)  or does it play only on the computer?. 
I have a program called Softie Audio converter that converts FLAC to Wave, amongst many other formats.

By the way I cannot see how you made a DVD-AUdio with the OPPO. Is it not an LPCM 24/96...?"
,Rhum_Keeper,2007-12-07T16:19Z,"Please do not bother to answer. It would probably be ""out of scope"". I ordered  the genuine article from Amazon in Europe, where I live.

I only use this site to obtain items not available in general trade at decent prices. This , fortunately is not the case..."

Before anything, Mr Dormir (in Spanish it means Sleep) the LSO is conducted by Stanislaw Skrowaczewsi. 
This applies to the Schumann and Lallo . Only the Saint-Sains Concerto is directed by Antal Dorati.
Next time, please pay attention.... I once heard and met Dorati personally in Brusssels 1980...

There is no point is discussing SACD, DVD-AUDIO, or the multitute of Codecs available on the Web..

The best sound I get from this this disc comes from the CD Layer from an Arcam DV79, analoque outputs.

I have a decent sound setup. The Amplifier is an Arcam FMJ A22, the speakers TANNOY GLENAIR, by-wired.

I recently bought the OPPO, for its DVD upsampling, using the Faroudja chip. I am very pleased with it, for such function...

As for audio, one cannot say is it bad, far from it. 
It is just not is the same league as an ARCAM.

As for listenning to classical music in a computer or an MP3 device, I would recommend it only to  poor people. It is better than no music at all, but beware. If you listen for that for over a year, you adapt your ears to bad quality.

I do not speak, without basis, I almost did that in 1975. My source was then a SONY Cassette deck. Bought my first vinyl in 1977... Still buy vinyl and it is the best music carrier..."

And can you tell what ADC you used for that conversion? I mean it was a PC sound card or standalone ADC?"
,pappe,2008-04-15T09:01Z,This DVD-A FLAC file plays fine with foobar2000 on my dirt cheap c-media sound card. What would it take to play an SACD FLAC file?
,kingpfa,2009-01-01T14:28Z,"Thanks a lot!!
Happy New Year~~"
