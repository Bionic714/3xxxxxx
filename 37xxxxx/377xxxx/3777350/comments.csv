,wankan,2007-08-24T13:12Z,"...  and here were are , 6 days later , with only 65.5% completed .
I always thought bittorrent was designed to be a speedy way to distribute data . 
I guess by adding 8 films on 18/08/07 and being unable to seed them all , was a mistake ."
,wankan,2007-08-28T12:46Z,"10 days later , 91.4% downloaded and 34 of us stuck . 
I don't know how 29 managed to download as I haven't caught sight of a seeder at all . 
Any help aappreciated ."
