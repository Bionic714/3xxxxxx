1. Uninstall any previous version of AnyDVD
Also remove previous registration information

2. Run the Leftover Killer

3. Install AnyDVD 6.1.7.0
At the last step before you hit finish,
double click Key.AnyDVD

4. Hit Finish.
The program will start and it will be registered.

5. Disable the Automatic Updates

As always, with all those new keys,
you will not be able to use the Blu-Ray and HD-DVD functions.
But it works perfect for good old DVDs. :)
