,nasr,2008-05-25T22:45Z,"I've had these peculiar tracks from Neverhood stuck in my head for over 10 years, but I never even knew the OST existed. Played through the game recently, and it still amazes me, despite the technical limitations of the mid-90s. Thank you so much for sharing! Will seed this forever :-)"
,nasr,2008-05-27T20:32Z,"For Mac users i recommend the free converter Max.
http://sbooth.org/Max/
Tinker with the preferences for your desired ouput format and optional iTunes import.
File > Open... - select the cue sheets - Convert!"
,nasr,2008-05-28T21:19Z,"One last thing: the .cue file for the 2nd CD isn't recognized properly in my audio converter and maybe others. All songs after track 6 are seen as one big udentifiable track. The problem seems to be caused by undefined behaviour of nested single (') and double ("") quotes.

Fix: open the .cue file in any text text editor. 
Change the line
    TITLE ""Sno, Yell '""Oh!'""""
to
    TITLE ""Sno, Yell Oh!""
Proceed as usual."

,Zpik3,2008-11-05T23:16Z,"Hi,
umm.. how do I listen to this? I can't seem to mount the files, and no program that I have recognizes the filetype.. What should I do?

I'm running XP."
,pimpedtuber,2009-03-16T20:58Z,"You should use Exact Audio Copy (EAC) software to burn it.
Those Cue and Bin files are not regular disk images."
