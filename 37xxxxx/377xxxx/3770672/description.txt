Captive Minds : Beyond Hypnosis.

"Groups which have all powerful leaders who control the environment, control all information and eventually control the way their followers think, have one basic thing in common : They have found people who are willing to take that essential first step of surrendering to an authority figure they hope has all the answers.

Throughout history, many people have taken that first step. Sometimes joining a small group, sometimes a large group. And sometimes, a group that engulfs an entire nation."

That powerful statement above, concludes this very well naratted documentary that focuses on three case studies to reveal the striking similarities in the indoctrination methods each uses to achieve long-term effects.
 
It is a film that serves as a reminder that we are all vulnerable to persuasion and long-term conditioning, and one that provokes serious consideration of the far-reaching implications of any form of psychological manipulation.
