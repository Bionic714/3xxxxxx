,phunkey,2007-08-23T20:18Z,Anyone get this to work? It still day countdown even if I do exactly as it says by replacing those files. Where should I put this ActivationServices.dll? Among those other installed files?
,Dayrider,2007-08-23T21:22Z,"ActivationServices.dll should be placed in the 
Common Files folder in the folder where DxO is installed, default being:

C: > Program Files > DxO Labs > Common Files
"
,phunkey,2007-08-25T14:36Z,"Thx, but is there supposed to be a folder named 'Common Files'? I don't have any. Now when I have uninstall it and reinstalled. Same problem, day counting and no Common Files dir. WTF?"
,phunkey,2007-08-25T14:58Z,Problem solved... nvm! Thx for the help.
,code_xlab,2007-10-27T12:25Z,"Big thanks for that! :)

,zlonaopako,2008-01-06T19:35Z,"Where canI get lens modules. If I go Help -> DxO Modules -> Install new or updated modules it says that downloader.exe is not available. I don't think it's recommended to DL it from them, or is it? what to do?"
,WedMar,2008-02-17T16:46Z,"Yeah, I've been using this for a while now. Rocks. But get me v5 now :)"
,QuickMik99,2008-04-15T10:50Z,any Â´ve this for appleÂ´s os x ?
,photodoug,2008-05-14T05:04Z,works okay but why is highlight recovery disabled?  That sucks because that's what I wanted it for. 
,Dayrider,2008-05-26T21:20Z,Highlight recovery is only possibel on RAW files.
,jeffmerlin,2008-05-26T21:33Z,"Right Dayrider! DxO is not clairvoyant althought it's close.  :-)  Heck! What is it to recover from 24 bits JPEG anyway... ? All in all it's a matter of interpolation in color depth and that will never be a true highlight recover. :-(

BTW: Guys, what happened to v5 ? I got it from TPB, but now it's gone. Was it virus? Fraud? I can not imagine it just died... Oh, I got it all right, but never tried it (yet). Maybe I should before whining about it here...  :-S

Geometry tool which is disabled? I am in Enhance mode. I cannot check/use the Volume Anamorphosis Correction. Kyestoning is working though.

Thank you for any advise. "
,spiker1,2008-11-05T01:23Z,"Hey, has anybody tried downloading DxO 5.X and copying the files from DxO 4.X to crack it?"
,webmiser,2010-08-22T02:54Z,"I followed the instructions and it starts, but crashes every time.
