LIONHEART - OPERATION VALKYRIE "
,4X-AXG,2007-08-16T19:52Z,nope I'm afraid not..maybe somebody can donate me money so I can buy those LOL :D
,N537JB,2007-08-16T20:39Z,"Well ruud, instead of donating to the newsgroups, buy the addons! ;)"
,4X-AXG,2007-08-16T21:11Z,"boy boy..again and again..I don't pay a penny for usenet access..again and again..my ISP has a free newsserver. and yes, I do buy add-ons if you must know"
,N537JB,2007-08-16T22:02Z,"but ruud if you are such a truly pirate, why do you DONATE to the developers? =)

Damn you're funny... You don't donate 5 $ to WoZ but you do buy addons for around 20$ minimum.. lol.. ur logic.. lmao"
,4X-AXG,2007-08-16T22:16Z,"ehmmm even I would want to donate to WoS, I couldn't, since Fergie blocked me ;-)

I don't mind 'donating' to developers; I only mind donating to pirates"
,Panodilo,2007-08-17T09:20Z,"lool - love the last bit about ""pleasant price"". It sure is."
,4X-AXG,2007-08-17T17:24Z,"haha yeah and the best part is..me and Wildmans have put that Aerosoft crack out there..without me and him, all the Aerosoft add-ons out there in the public, wouldn't be there..but I guess the WoShitters have forgotten about that"
,4X-AXG,2007-08-19T22:28Z,read kid read..I never said I created that crack..I only said me and Wildmans have put it out there
,shmuckhead,2007-08-20T12:27Z,"Dear Mr. 4X-AXG-FAG,

You mentioned that our goodend Mr. 4X-AXG is a ""Jew Fucker"". I am unclear whether this is a slight against our Hebrew members or a tip of the hat to Mr. 4X-AXG for sharing his passions with the Semitc ladies.

I opt for the latter as it is a more postive note on 4X-XG's comportment and is well in keeping with our motto; all you need is love la-la-la-la-la-la"

,yeoldecaptain,2008-01-20T05:30Z,"Per the instructions in the readme:

1. go to C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Local Settings\Temp

That's an XP value.  In Vista, I have traced it as far as /users/username . . . . the only folder in my username is called ""appdata"".  Can this addon even be installed in Vista?  If so may I have the correct path please?"
