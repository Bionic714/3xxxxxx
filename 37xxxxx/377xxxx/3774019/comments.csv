Cars : Mercedes, ferrari, mercedes-benz, nissan, audi,. ford, shelby, lambourghini, auston martin, lotus, maserati, jaguar, mclaren, spyker, koeningsegg, pagani, caddilac and some more.

NOT ALL CARS FUCKING FUCK.

And for a real kick you better BUY the game because then you can play online, and thats mutch more fun than singleplayer ;)

Bikes: Ducati, kawasaki, mv agusta, triumph."

,Brig22,2008-05-11T15:25Z,"There's nothing wrong with the upload. I appreciate the time and effort the uploader and the seeders have spared to make it available.

That aside, this is one miserable little dog of a game. To suffer it for only a short time and stumble over such a plethora of bugs and silly performance issues! The graphics are not that great to justify the skippy stuff..

Furthermore, the controls are fucking outrageous; by the end of your first rent-a-ride, you should be referring to this game as ""Slippy Wheels: Limitless"".

And don't expect that merely tweaking the steering sensitivity will save you, either. 

Woe betide any of you poor sods that won't heed my words."

These things with the spinning camera, and no racing events working, they all occur when you are missing some crack files, you DO NOT only need the cracked exe in some BIN folder i don't remember it at all but you need 2 have ONE folder FULL OF CRACK FILES to make the racing events and model events all work, i will update my comment asap (when i downloaded it installed again and did all the stuff to make it work)"

,h709055,2012-07-26T11:14Z,"READ THIS!

REPAIR YOUR GAME!

THIS VERSION IS CORRUPTED, BUT YOU CAN EASILY MAKE IT WORK!
You can't participate in any challenge, because some of the files are missing. You must download a folder ""Euro/Bnk/Ige"" and put it in your game directory.

To fix the problems, follow these advices:
1. Mount and install the game. Don't crack it yet. Don't run it. Don't run YASU (in fact, you can delete YASU).
1. Install a 1.66a patch (the newest one), it will fix some bugs. You can download it here: http://www.gamefront.com/files/Test+Drive+Unlimited+v1.66A+Patch+%28Download%29/;8070497;/fileinfo.html
2. Download and install a crack called ""Test Drive Unlimited 1.66a Crack - HATRED"". It's all over Google. I've played TDU for many hours now and this crack works perfectly fine for me.
3. Look for a file called ""vty-tdu.rar"". It contains the folder ""Euro/Bnk/Ige"". Extract it to your game folder.
4. Run the game and play! You don't need YASU."
