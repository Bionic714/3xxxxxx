,Maxx0r,2007-09-13T19:06Z,"I agree with alien.
Does this work?What's the whole situation with this one?"
,Logan78,2007-09-30T02:50Z,NO YOU CANNOT play online with this you need a legit serial from a bought game if you bought the game and cd got scratched then you can dl this and play but you still need to buy the game to play online
,cheshster,2007-11-15T16:03Z,Any chance of a reseed on this? I had to reformat and can't find any other torrent of this :(

go ther eto look for private servers, they tend to be glitchy but they are free. "
,zeta2099,2009-03-29T00:48Z,Alenzerox this only works if you have an account already for FFXI; this means play for free? not in a million years... this type of download is only for ppl that misplaced or lost the discs of the game...
