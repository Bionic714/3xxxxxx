Thunder Live at the Planet Rock Xmas Party in the Carling Academy, Islington on Thursday December 19th 2006!

I was lucky enough to be at this gig last December. The Islington Academy was surprisingly only about a sixth of the size of the Glasgow Academy and only holds about 600. Good to see the band in such a small venue again. Enjoy!
