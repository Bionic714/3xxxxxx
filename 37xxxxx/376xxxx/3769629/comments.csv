,misfisk,2010-08-09T23:40Z,"Thanks mate, I've been looking forward to playing this and seeing what all the fuzz is about.

And to the people who don't yet get torrent technology: The download speed is dependant on the seeders and their upload speeds. The download in an of it self cannot be fast. It doesn't make sense.

And @goldenswordsman: Heh, you suck :)"

Are you kidding right?? ""Sacrifice is the pioneer of the mouse-gesture control system, which was praised as revolutionary in Peter Molyneux's later game Black & White"" Sacrifice 2000, B&W 2001 Â¬Â¬
Oh and ""Sacrifice was the first commercial video game to make full use of video graphics cards that can process transform, clipping, and lighting instructions""
@Javabean I played this game when it was first released, thx for uploading! Been searching for a while"

,zdMomo,2011-11-15T19:56Z,"win7 x64-bit, VGA: ATI RADEON HD3800:

The game itself is excellent, I found myself attracted to the game story, graphic is what it is. (you can get used to it)"

,Billy210,2012-01-29T19:12Z,"WINDOWS 7 X64 / NVIDIA CARD - GRAPHICS PROBLEMS

For anyone having issues with Sacrifice using the above hardware/software combo, try the following fix (originally from sacrificeplanet.net):

*** Install Sacrifice Patch #3 (google it) ***

**Download Latest Nvidia Drivers** http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us

1) Download Nvidia Inspector. http://downloads.guru3d.com/NVIDIA-Inspector-1.94-download-2612.html

2) Open it and under driver version select profile settings (located in the middle of the program).

3) Then have the ""_GLOBAL_DRIVER_PROFILE (Base Profile)"" selected or you can make another one specialized for Sacrifice. (located at the top of the window you opened). Then click ""add application current profile"" and add the original sacrifice.exe.

4) Click ""Scan Nvidia Predefined Profiles..."" (located to the upper right hand side of the window)
*Please Note*: If you can't do this then you must first click ""Create a desktop shortcut to run profile settings"" (located to the upper right hand side of the window) and run the shortcut then scan ""Scan Nvidia Predefined Profiles...""

5) After you finish scanning, scroll down to the Unknown Section and look for the Setting ID ""PRE_D3D9_COMPATIBILITY_BITS"" and set the Value to ""0x00000040 (King's Bounty, X2: Wolverine's Revenge, Independence War 2 - Edge of Chaos, Falcon 4.0 Allied Force, MS Flight Simulator X, Links 2003, Gothic 2, Gothic 1)""

6) Hit apply settings (located to the upper right hand side of the window) and run Sacrifice. 

It worked like a charm for me!"
