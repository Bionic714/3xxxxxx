Any ideas?"
,lamuella,2008-08-10T07:48Z,I love this game.  Thanks.
,xheffalump,2008-11-29T09:51Z,"Thanks so much for this! I've played this game since I was a kid, but recently I found out that my CDs were damaged so the game froze at a certain point.

I hate to be a pain, but I need a little pointer ... the game installed just fine (I did the full installation so I wouldn't need to keep swapping CDs), yet when I try to run the game, the first screen comes up and then it just closes itself down.

I've tried changing the compatability, mounting all of the CDs and nothing works. I don't think it's Vista because it ran just fine on my other PC.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, please comment back or e-mail me at : chemicalxterror@hotmail.co.uk"
,Carpe_Mofo,2009-04-21T20:53Z,"Apparently a codec that starship titanic uses was updated in windows service pack 2 causing problems in the game try downloading ftp://ftp.probo.com/pub/cinepak/cvid32.zip (official codec from the people who invented it) and then putting the two files there your program folder for Starship Titanic, the game should work. If your leery of downloading a file, you can go to the starship titanic website and they link to the codec."

I've got Windows 7 x64, and I use both of the below files, run as an administrator, and in Windows Vista (Service Pack 1) compatibility mode.
