Thanks u r providing an invaluable service to willing  self initiates and researchers alike. I for example uploaded the  A .'. A .'. System that u have included in a  other release by yourselves. It took a while to compile but i thought something like it should be made available. Personally i like to have a digital copy for quick reference but find it a must to have the actual physical book in my personal library when possible.

Love is the law, love under will
