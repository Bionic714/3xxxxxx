,iloveyourmom1368,2007-08-09T06:26Z,"""Christianity is stupid. Give up.""

I find that very offensive sir!

I'm a stupid person and I don't appreciate you associating my actions with christianity.. Being a stupid person like myself one of the few things I can sit down and say to myself at the end of the day is, ""Hey, I may be dumb, but at least I'm not a fucking christian!""

lol..."

,Helmer2,2007-11-27T23:24Z,"Well, you don´t have to look any further than to Paul to find the real antichrist. You could actually say that the christian religion we have today was created by the antichrist himself.

The only person who comes close to being the historical Jesus, Judas from Galilée, was probably the real founder of what later was to become the pagan christianity we have today.

Judas/Jesus was a jewish anarchist and a first century revolutionary."
