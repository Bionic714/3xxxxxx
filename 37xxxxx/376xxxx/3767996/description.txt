- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

   In a time where countless bands rely on the tried and true right hand path of
   conventionality, convenience and commercially viable song structure, along
   comes South Carolina?s THROUGH THE EYES OF THE DEAD to breathe some
   (arguably) much needed life into modern metal. Malice, the band?s latest
   effort, shows THROUGH THE EYES OF THE DEAD showcasing a more brutal, violent
   and focused aural attack than many listeners may have expected.

   With new frontman Nate Johnson (ex-Premonitions of War) firmly in tow,
   THROUGH THE EYES OF THE DEAD have constructed a brutally heavy record, worthy
   of Johnson?s guttural and deep growling onslaught and already established
   extreme credentials. Pairing a more death metal sound, thanks to mature
   riffing and frantic drumming, along with Johnson?s vocal repertoire has given
   the band new life; where many bands opt for a more ?mature? or melodic sound
   as time passes them by, THROUGH THE EYES OF THE DEAD has done the complete
   opposite. Heavier, faster and more extreme are the new dictators here.

   And why not? Considering the band enlisted the skills of Erik Rutan
   (ex-Morbid Angel, Hate Eternal) to record Malice, THROUGH THE EYES OF THE
   DEAD?s progression into the territory of unabashed death metal with hints of
   guitar-driven melody and plenty of double bass, one could say the move was an
   aptly-timed shift into heavier waters. The follow-up to 2005?s Bloodlust,
   Malice builds upon the solid - and dedicated - fan base the band established
   while headlining small venues, hitting the road with the likes of Children of
   Bodom, God Forbid and Sounds of the Underground 2006, as well as ultimately
   concluding the record?s cycle with a vastly successful headlining tour in the
   winter of 2006, now is the time that THROUGH THE EYES OF THE DEAD establishes
   itself as a band that will be around for awhile; not just another flavor of
   the week.
