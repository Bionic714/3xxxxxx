- Ben Rich, former head of Lockheed Skunkworks, said at a UCLA Alumni Speech in 1993, ""We already have the means to travel among the stars, but these technologies are locked up in black projects and it would take an Act of God to ever get them out to benefit humanity...Anything you can imagine, we already know how to do.""

- Boyd Bushman, a Lockheed Martin Senior Research Scientist, testifies about Anti Gravity, UFOs, Roswell, Wright Patterson AFB, UFOs and more, and demonstrates anti-gravity in the film.

- Professor David Phillips (Santa Monica College) gives us an emergency plan to save us from global warming, and talks about his UFO experiences.

- Professor Roger Weir shows us the ancient connection to Pythagoras and interstellar beings that may be here, in our skies, and among us today.

- Professor Robert Thurman tells us the ancient Buddhist secrets of UFOs and invisible dimensions, cities and the legendary Shambhala!

- The UFO Briefing Scene includes a round table debate with experts over the issue of extraterrestrials fighting over who gets earth next if we destroy it. Is our planet so valuable that a war may begin over its future?

- The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster: what was really behind it? Did ETs shoot down the Columbia?

- How can we engineer our own spacecraft and conquer the universe?
Will we be able to do it before our destruction?

- What happens to 6.5 billion souls if we lose planet earth?"

Good Work.

Keep it up.

Best Regards."
,journeyer,2007-08-12T12:24Z,"It's a horrible concoction of misunderstood science and physics. When David Seredna in a state of slight panic whilst reading that scientists have been unable to find other Earth like planets in our galaxy proclaimes that we have nowhere to go. And so forth.
What, of course, Mr. Seredna doesn't realize is that while we haven't found any planets yet that can sustain human life, the reason is we are not yet able to look close enough.

If Mr. Seredna knew anything about physics and space exploration he would know that today we have no means of actually seeing planets in other solar systems. The only way we can today prove that alien solar systems have planets is by these planets' gravitational influence over their own star - causing a slight ""wobble"" in the stars orbit. However, the planets we can spot using this method are required to be quite massive. As such most of the planets we have found outside our own solar system are jovian gas giants. Obviously we cannot live on these. 

Earth planets need to be smaller and less massive in order to support liquid water and a comfortable gravity for human life. 

Also pointing to a deadline of 5 to 10 years before disaster following global warming sets in is also way beyond even the most pessimistiv predictions by climatologists today. "
,tommyjw,2007-08-22T03:24Z,"This guy doesn't understand much.  I spent 1 1/2 hours looking at his 4 hours worth of crap and couldn't handle any more.  he is totally out of his field.  yes, I do believe in anti-gravity propulsion but this guy doesn't have a clue.  The effect demonstrated about the energized coil from house current over conductive material is used by maglev trains.  it's nothing new.  he make rediculous conclusions.  DON""T WASTE YOUR TIME IF YOU ARE IN SERIOUS STUDY OF THIS TECHNOLOGY.  Looked more like he was preparing a movie for interview with Steven Spielburg.  He's got good movie making ability!"
,kukenifitta,2007-08-25T07:13Z,LOL...such fools. WouldnÂ´t spend a nano-second on this crap...
,pilatuspilot,2007-08-31T16:24Z,"Thanks for this.
With over 50 years studying science, philosophy, spirituality (mediterranean-based & asia-oriented) I've observed that not every theory is going to be to my liking, for whatever reason or emotion.
It is amazing, however, how folk who pride themselves on being so rational and science-oriented (empirical, let's say) let their emotions get the best of it when someone's views go against their own. I actually think it is bad upbringing, community-wise. They must have learned their theories and performed their experiments (if they did any) in a closed society where all the 'scientists' and 'thinkers' either lock-stepped with one another or they were banished from the community.
The history of scientific mindsets and the history of philosophy are speckled with these types of communities. Those who hated & banished the likes of Plato, Galileo, DaVinci, Ficino, Bohr, Oppenheimer are just a few that come to my mind this very moment.
If one's views don't agree with yours just move on. After all, does one go ballistic at a smorgasbord because the table is set no only with fish and vegetables and poultry, but also with that cow liver you can't quite stomach?
The dangerous mind is one who thinks and feels that because one doesn't like a view every else must hold fast to their opinion. That is nothing but false pride based on an arrogant myopia.

Thanks for the share. I'll give it a good go. I might agree with 10% or 99%, but at least I'll give it a go. There's always a seed in every thought; the genius sees what it is dormant or dead therein. The fool tosses it to the wind because he is blind to what to do with a seed."
,pilatuspilot,2007-08-31T16:45Z,"Hey ""kukenifitta"", your comment took much more than that nano-second you so proudly boasted you wouldn't spend on the subject. Who is the proven fool, mate? You are. Your statement proves it. You might wish you are capable of under-standing out-of-current concepts but your brief silly statement proves you are the same pedestrian mindset of the townfolk who worried Edison was the devil's child.
People like you are a danger to any advancement of thought. You are a scientific & philosophical Nazi. Period.
If you would like to discuss this 1-on-1 give me you email addie so we can go at it."
,malvin,2008-01-06T20:03Z,"Thanks alot for the upload.. but the video quality appears awful, considering its 720x404, it's REALLY pixellated, is it like that on the originals? "
,malvin,2008-01-07T23:52Z,"Oop's, disregard my last comment.. Seems fine now. My PC!!"
,Smoke.Lord,2008-01-09T03:57Z,If we got this exelent technology why does the seed technology so fuckin bad? Just kiddin love conspirsy theory's and my speed is good :D Peace !
,nuboo,2008-03-12T01:11Z,"Yes, please every body, this is the reason to why you download before you decide to buy,
so you don't waste your money!
Although ufos and free energy is real, this guys is fucking dramaticing the whole thing and trying to make him and his girlfrind look like moviestars............. this is no documentry"
,blubbare,2008-03-15T12:50Z,"You know..i dont think we will have to go any where..i think the truth about were we are NOW is so much simplier. Its all beautiful and we can stay here and continue our inner travel!

Dont make dramatisations about stuff, just breath and take it easy! So even if its gets a bit hotter or milder on some parts of the world, who says thats wrong? Well, the mental, not very vivid, fearful mind tells us its wrong! Dont trust that, it is as its best and we are safe no matter what, after all!! Listen to the heart and try not be so mental...in that we dont have to fear anymore! "
,the-chojin,2008-11-06T13:06Z,"i did a lot of this stuff in uni from anti grav to solor sails most of it is possable but you canot do suspended animation without tissue degenaration.
the only way would be to send dna with robots to grow us."
,fw2011,2011-01-07T04:31Z,Anyone in my eyes that blames the human race for the destruction of our planet is a shill or deeply deceived. Engines that run off of water in the 70's. diesel engines run on mixed vegetable oil. the electric car invented in the early 1900's. Technology is suppressed and were basically forced to use oil because of money mongers. To me this is propaganda and misinformation.
,morepunk,2011-08-21T03:17Z,whats the point of seeding if your only uploading 10kb p/s? cockwads
,morepunk,2011-08-21T09:44Z,"fuck you fucks. this is on youtube. (tpb wont let me post the link)  part 13 0:28 with boyd bushman, the lockeed martin senior research scientist, imo the only reason to watch this film"
