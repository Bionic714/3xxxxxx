I didnt make this but thx PiratesInc for creating this torrent.
 
test installed this to a Windows XP Pro SP2 2 gig P4 with 512mb ram.
I first installed after burning the images to cd with Nero.
Entered the serial, installed, ran the 9.1 update, started the program, did a quick training session, and was up and running.

I then uninstalled, mounted the images with DaemonTools, and again had a successful install.

scanned for viruses and theres none.
