,AURAMAXIMUS,2007-08-17T16:59Z,Hey picard! I want to thank you for your commitment to this torrent!!! I started dl this torrent sometime ago but on my old sluggish pc and well I stopped at 70% cause my wireless just kept on droping on me...that said...is it possible to transfer the torrent folder to the directory on my new pc...i tried copying it but for some reason after it finished transfer it just disapeared?
,picard77,2007-08-18T18:42Z,"Im not sure if it works... My first thought is that is should be possible, but there might be differences between clients too I guess."
,picard77,2007-09-17T19:50Z,"Listen guys and girls, I have now seeded this 5.0+ and keep seeing people getting 100% and just end their seeding.

I will seed this a day ore so more, then its up to you."
