SUMMARY

Beowulf. [Translated by Francis Barton Gummere]. This is a short but
beautiful book, and the Gummere translation really captures the feel
of the Old English. Beowulf tells the story of a mysterious young
warrior who saves the Spear-Danes from the terrible monster Grendel
and his venomous mother. Long a mainstay of English Literature 101
courses at universities around the world, it is not only one of the
oldest, but one of the most exciting English folktales ever
invented. Summary by Caeristhiona
