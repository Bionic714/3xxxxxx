Thank you much for this post, LoRd_tErabYte."

I really admire your taste in films, especially Japanese fare. This is an existential fable, a fact that is revealed by repeated viewings. By the way, do you know the out of the way film Shonen (Boy) by Nagisa Oshima? Also looking for Passage du Rhin (Tomorrow Is My Turn), Le (1960) with Charles Aznavour, Hobson's Choice with John Mills, a good copy of Resurrection with Ellen Burstyn, and, I Heard the Owl Call My Name with Tom Courtney. Probably an odd collection, but each is especially engaging and memorable and not available.

,LezDawson,2009-01-03T04:37Z,What's with the low-res rip?  512 x 384?  For a 2-CD / 1.26GB rip you could easily go to at least 640 x 480. 
,erPlay,2012-03-29T09:13Z,2 CD???
,erPlay,2012-03-29T09:14Z,why
