""As a scientist,"" Richard Dawkins writes, ""I am hostile to fundamentalist religion because it actively debauches the scientific enterprise. It teaches us not to change our minds, and not to want to know exciting things that are available to be known. It subverts science and saps the intellect"" (p. 284). In other words, the greatest crime of fundamental Christianity is to think without asking scientific questions. For those readers already familiar with Dawkins' work, it will come as no surprise that this book is nothing less than brilliant. Pity those readers, however, who either won't read this book (they should) or who will find nothing positive to say about it, because this is the work of one the greatest thinkers of our time. 

In THE GOD DELUSION, Dawkins, the celebrated evolutionary biologist, Oxford Professor, and author (The Selfish Gene: 30th Anniversary Edition--with a new Introduction by the Author, The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design, A Devil's Chaplain: Reflections on Hope, Lies, Science, and Love, The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution), gives us a carefully-reasoned yet entertaining treatise on atheism that is equally eloquent and provocative. His basic argument is that the collective irrational belief in ""The God Hypothesis"" is not only wrong (""intellectual high treason""), but pernicious in its resulting intolerance, oppression, bigotry, arrogance, child abuse, homophobia, abortion-clinic bombings, cruelties to women, war, suicide bombers, and educational systems that teach ignorance when it comes to math and science. Sure to provoke his adversaries, Dawkins not only portrays the ""psychotic"" God of the Old Testament as ""arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully"" (p. 31), but also challenges, quite convincingly, every major argument for God's existence, and shows that the Founding Fathers considered religion to be a threat to democracy. Thomas Jefferson, for instance, claimed ""Christianity is the most perverted system that ever shone on man"" (p. 43). Benjamin Franklin said ""Lighthouses are more useful than churches"" (p. 43). A 1796 treaty signed by John Adams declares, ""the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion"" (p. 40). Adams also said, ""this would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were no religion in it"" (p. 43). Even conservative icon, Barry Goldwater, threatened to fight fundamentalists ""every step of the way if they try to dictate their moral convictions to all Americans"" (p. 39). 

While Dawkins is clearly out to change minds here, unfortunately, for most of his readers, he is only preaching to the choir. Nevertheless, for its erudite advocacy of science and rationalism at odds with the divisive, oppressive, injurious, and deadly forces of religion, THE GOD DELUSION is highly recommended. Further reading in this area includes Daniel Dennett's, Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon (2006) and Sam Harris's, Letter to a Christian Nation (2006) and Christopher Hitchins' recent God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything.

,prugio,2009-12-16T14:58Z,What an excellent collection. Thanks!
,templar42,2010-01-16T22:00Z,"I wouldn't contribute a penny to that theologically unsophisticated philistine's royalties, but I need to have read these books to teach my students. Thank goodness for peer to peer filesharing!"
,ukBikerman,2011-09-03T23:00Z,"LOL...Theology isn't an academic subject. It is an attempt to justify the unjustifiable by referencing an iron-age book and using tautology, supposition and invention."
,Epigene,2012-05-25T19:45Z,"I've read only The Selfish Gene so far and it was absolutely brilliant, even almost 40 years after its publication as relevant and fresh as ever. I have no doubt that the rest of the books are as great."
