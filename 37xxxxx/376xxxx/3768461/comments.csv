See here http://www.bucknercomputer.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=97 , but you have to choice ""Apply existing license key"", you tape ""Next"" and then you choice ""kav By YES-NO(1-4-2008).key"", that's it all.
(Sorry for my english)

I have always Kaspersky 6, but anyway thanks to ""YES-NO"" for this upload."

,kiahq83,2007-09-26T03:13Z,"hey man, the key just got blacklisted, is thr a way to get a new key. pls let me knw thnks."
,TheBlackPearl,2007-09-26T04:03Z,"BLACKLISTED, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME DOWNLOADING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,ZonzoMaster,2007-09-26T06:02Z,"Ok, i double-checked, it's the update, the key will work if you rollback the update, they won't let anyone use a pirate product, or at least let it update. I tried many keys, don't bother.

I'll give time to the community to ""fix"" the issue, but i installed and reinstalled and checked, it's that. Use the trial mode while they ""fix it"", now, how about telling me if nod32 is good to use in the mean time?"
,tonyk123,2007-09-26T08:06Z,"it work very well & then, the message, ""your key has been blacklisted!"""
,Necro-File,2007-09-29T01:09Z,It seems that all the keys on most torrent sites have been black listed. Kaspersky is kaput! At least if you pirated it.
,azoapes,2007-10-07T09:12Z,"I don't know shit about cracking, but it should be possible to force Kaspersky to retrieve its updates from the trial server and block Kaspersky's attempts to blacklist the current key, shouldn't it?"
