,spawn4ever,2007-08-09T16:25Z,"Does this keygen only work with the Adobe Master Production CS3 Encore version?

I just tried it with Adobe Encore CS3 stand alone and no go.

I'll try it with the Master Production CS3 and will let you guys know."

,apeiron69,2007-09-03T17:30Z,"The keygen doesn't work for serials but the serial inside the .txt file works. But now from sept 1st they fired that serial ( if I put it I have license expired), now I cleaned up the cache but WHERE IS ANOTHER WORKING SERIAL ? Around they made serials for everything (PS, PREMIERE; FIREWORKS) but noone that creates a new serial (or keygen) for encore ? Please guys..."
,DeathGrind,2008-02-05T09:10Z,This works with the stand alone Encore CS3.  I just changed the last four digits in the activation number to the last four number's from the request code.  Worked for me.  Thanks
,jgy786,2008-03-08T14:26Z,"1) First off, delete C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe PCD\cache\cache.db

2) Then run any of the CS3 (Encore in your case) programs. Click Accept to continue, 
then enter your serial that used to work. BEFORE clicking next, you'll notice that 
you have a NEW cache.db file in C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe PCD\cache

3) Right click the file, go to properties and make it READ ONLY, and then click 
next on CS3 after entering your key.

4) Next, after you get to the register software screen.

Click ""Register Later""

5) Now it should be working, technically speaking that is, but you're not done yet.

The register screen should have popped up again. This time, remove the check for 
""Read Only"" from that new cache.db file and select ""Do Not Register"" from the the 
top of the register software menu.

6) Now, as soon as you click continue, make the cache.db file read only again, 
and LEAVE IT THAT WAY to prevent a possible reoccurrence or Adobe trying to send 
the patch through again disguised as an ""update"".

Remember that if you need to reinstall the serials of any CS3 product which was 
working prior to the creation since you have created a new cache.db file you must 
temporarily uncheck the ?read only? properties box for the cache.db. 

Then after inserting the serials and reactivating them close the program and then 
recheck the box.

Hope this works as it certainly did for me."
,sebleb,2008-03-26T12:46Z,"Thanks jgy786, your method worked for me. I've downloaded this torrent, Adobe Encore CS3 retail serial[www pirateuropa com], use this Activation method (Adobe Encore CS3 Activation), but when started encore I got a msg saying license has expired. So I then followed method from jgy786 and it works great. "
,Flat|iner,2008-05-20T21:14Z,Anybody been able to run the .exe in Windows Vista? Doesn't work for me.
,issox,2008-10-02T18:08Z,"Jgy - you are a genius.

This does work on Vista, but I did have some initial confusion.

You must first install 'Adobe Encore CS3 Retail [RH]' from pirate's bay - going through all the stages until the 30 day trial is working.

Then use the 'EncoreCS3 Activation' above. 

Once you used the keygen you should then get the 'expired' message. It is ONLY at this stage that jgy's advice works.

I had tried applying it while installing the [RH] version - which didnt work. 

All installed perfectly - even on Vista.

,issox,2008-10-04T03:31Z,"Just wondering,

The app is running fine, but menus ive created are not recognized in standard dvd players.

Is this a problem with the app, or am I just doing something wrong ? "
,seriespro,2008-11-09T07:40Z,"Worked for me.  Followed the instructions and the program activated fine.  Just because you have it, you still have to know how to use it."
