,zorans,2008-01-27T18:10Z,For those who travels light and fast. Nero 8 is too fat and full of crap. Downloaded and installed in 2 mins. Works fine. Thanks to UltraDragonwolf.
,Spyke88,2008-02-07T18:02Z,"I prefer Nero v6 over v8, so much more userfriendly.

Thanks for the upload!

,Aurand,2008-02-13T01:03Z,The keygen tests positive for a trojan.
,pheonicks,2008-03-26T04:10Z,Thanks it works great!
,Jesto_III,2008-04-25T15:06Z,There is a trojan on this torrent...
,g21sf45,2008-05-27T22:49Z,"You dumbasses who say that this torrent has a trojan... get a clue! You should know by now that many, if not all, keygen programs will generate a ""false-positive"" alert when running an anti-virus scan. This is common, and no cause for panic! And if you can't understand that, then don't download anything... you morons."
,asser1,2008-06-01T12:21Z,"Thx , I do really need this program . becouse my DVD decrypter couldn't find my Disk drive . "
,FiN_Dogii,2008-07-17T16:01Z,Lmao this took only 20 sec to load ^^ thnx!

,linkinpark187,2008-09-06T10:03Z,"many thanks to UltraDragonwolf for this torrent.  within a matter of a few minutes, it was downloaded and ready to go.  i'm not quite sure how most others are coming up with a virus, because avast! never came up with anything for me.  i'll be seeding this.  thanks again!"
,raisak,2008-09-27T11:31Z,"1A23-0609-9130-2414-1564-7334

So now you dont have to use the keygen :P"
,ironroses,2008-10-05T00:38Z,"The last version before they decided it'd be a great idea to include a pile of added crap.

At the end of the day Nero shoudl've stayed like this but with minor improvement, such as firmware updates and added support for new media such as blu-ray but no, they had to add shit such as ""nero vision""

Thanks for this. Work great!"
,maxkill,2008-10-05T23:30Z,I agree who needs a 300 mb burning program if ure not into HD material or some other fancy shit ... thanks!

,hugo1965,2010-01-12T14:13Z,Thanx...
,michaelrwatson,2010-03-09T23:27Z,"BEST VERSION OF NERO EVER!!!!  No crack needed--this uses a SERIAL. 

Only 32MB and does everything those bloated 172MB and 643MB versions do. Wtf?? I have a copy of this one on all my drives--works on campus, at home, no problemo. THANKS."
,michaelrwatson,2010-03-09T23:48Z,"Btw, meant to add, all you dipshits who are getting false positive for the keygen, Symantec 2010 finds NO virus, and I've been using this version for years without a single problem. (Btw, Nero7 sucks gigantic cock just like v8) "
,diglipaf,2010-09-08T13:55Z,my nod 32 found virussssss
,Miki71,2012-03-16T15:28Z,AVG find VIRUS !!!
