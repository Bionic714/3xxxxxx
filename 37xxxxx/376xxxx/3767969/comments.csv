,lee369,2007-12-30T22:10Z,"Thank you for this program. I am looking forward to using it. 

Please can you help speed this up. I have been downloading for about 3 weeks 24/7 and only have 5 gbs. so anthing that will help would be appreciated.  

also, I have downloaded the install part and took a look at it. It said to be sure to download 'word builder' to go along with this. Any idea of what word builder is? 

one other question- after this is downloaded can it be stored on dvd? or will I need another external hard drive just for it.


I am looking forward to finally being able to use this it should be great fun.

Thank you again, and again for going to the trouble of trying to download such a file. "

I am currently at 95% for the library. I have been waiting a very long time for this. If there are any seeders out there that wish to help me (and possibly others) get this to 100% by seeding at full blast, I would so very much appreciate it. 

I will seed the shit out of this even after it is 100%. There's nothing like sharing and honor among men!! AND women!

,pugsly708,2008-09-02T11:11Z,"So I got the program runningon FL STUDIO XXL8 an the voices among the library are working fine.  My question is:
How do I get Word Builder work with Symponic Choirs in FL STUDIO?"
,pugsly708,2008-09-02T11:14Z,The program runs fine... The only issue I have is trying to make the choirs sing whatever I type in word builder... I can't seem to figure out.  I'm sure it's such an obvious solution that someone will eventually point out.
,pugsly708,2008-09-05T22:20Z,"Ok so I've gotten a little bit further.  My problem now is when I try and open Word Builder under FL STUDIO as a VST Plugin, I get a message that says ""This plugin doesn't seem to be valid""  

Any suggestions? Anyone?"
,azvareth,2008-09-08T08:37Z,"Tja!

I have no suggestion for you (yet) as I am struggeling with the DL, I only have ~50kB/s down, but are giving away 300-400 (sometimes 500) kB/s (pls don't limit UL speed for others if u can afford it).

Anyhow :P I will come back with a review in the end of this week (have 17h left to DL with this speed).


RWU (Read/Write yoU)"
,azvareth,2008-09-08T10:38Z,"Im kind of pissed right now.

You who DL and get 100% Dont stop UL when your done, not even if your ratio exceeds 1.0, why ? because the speed for us other will not increase and what if the 4 other who has been on 100% stops the UL (I guess they have way over 100% in share ratio) then there will be no more torrent.

OK! so you dont give a shit, you got the thing - but what about us other? sharing is caring, leaching is hmmm Svenska: Jävla egoistiskt! -far o flyg era djävlar.

//ME"
,azvareth,2008-09-09T06:46Z,"Ok!

It's down, and I tried the Choir thing, Obviously my memory Is to small, the thing wan't load completely (should figured that out with 1.44 GB samplebanks) I can't use it. however the parts that did load sounds OK.

So if you got lots of mem (and I am talking LOT now) then I am sure this is a good instrument.

Anyhow I am UL this with ~1.5 MB/s for a while so that those who have the mem can get it faster.

And Danell, Thanks for the share.

,inqognito,2008-09-09T22:56Z,Nu börjar jag bli riktigt jävla irriterad... Ingenting funkar som det ska och programmet lägger av såfort jag öppnat det. Jag har följt dina anvisningar till 100%..Vad fan gör jag för jävla fel???Kan du hjälpa mig här eller??
,inqognito,2008-09-09T23:11Z,vill be om ursäkt för mitt grova språk men jag var bara irriterad för stunden och inte på dig jag ver mer frustrerad över vad jag gjorde för fel...kan det hjälpa om jag säger att jag använder vista?? jag kan inte ens registrera produkten heller..Mvh
,azvareth,2008-09-09T23:29Z,"Hmmm! det låter som om du tror det är jag som initialt tankat upp skiten, det har jag inte, jag ville bara testa och se om den här körgrejen är realistisk.

Nåväl: jag själv kör XP, efter vad jag förstår med Vista så måste du i princip ange adminbehörighet varje gång du ska göra något ""tungt"" och ""viktigt"" (en slutsats dragen efter att ha läst många inlägg om just Vista). När det gäller XP så fick jag göra på följande sätt:

Jag har parallelt med dessa samplefiler laddat ner själva motorn (instrumentet/installern) och den sk ""wordbuildern"" med installern följer en keygen vilkas resultat som ska appliceras på rätt ställen. därefter ska du kopiera hela sample mappen (denna torrents DL) till installation mappen eller nånstans (du får en förfrågan om att ange korrekt sökväg till dessa filer om instrumentet inte kan hitta dessa).

Sedan använder du instrumentet i din VSTi/DXi SEQ, och i ditt instrument får du sedan ladda in den eller de röster du vill använda...

tja! jag fick det till att funka på första försöket iallafall även om jag inte kunde ladda in hela samplen... (1.44GB) så kunde jag höra nåt jävla ahhh åhhh ohhh kör.

//HA DE"
,inqognito,2008-09-10T15:32Z,"hhm det står såhär när jag försöker öppna programmet som en vst eller dxi: 

Error D:\CVS\ni\1.3.4\gp\src\Common/Init_GP.cpp:51

Och då stängs hela programmet ner

Eller så brukar det stå såhär: 

""Access violation at adress 77C77DD2 in module 'ntdll.dll'. Write of address 00000024"" The plugin cant be loaded

vad kan det vara för fel ?"

"
,HKt0p5,2008-10-14T02:17Z,"*squeeeeeeeee*!!!
A MUST-HAVE FOR ANY SUSUMU HIRASAWA FAN!

...okay.. problem No.1..
I don't have a HDD section on my PC THIS BIG!.. but I figured this out. I can download the soundbanks one by one on an external and transfer them around to use! And know what I found out? - when I first started the DL directly on the external, it said it'll take 3 YEARS AND 2 DAYS to download - and then I tried the single file thing, and there - my advice is,
if you try to download all the soundbanks at once, it gets the slow speed, but if you have the option to open the .torrent file and pick files from it to dl, to get it faster, do this, fisrt, download everything except the soundbanks files at once, and then reload the torrent every time and download one by one the rest - it's a LOT faster.

As a side note.. I'm amazed this program works on a AMD 1.04GHz with 384 RAM... with TONS of errors and without the possibility of ever loading more than 4 of the files in the library... but still, it's working. O_o"

,Daylife33,2009-02-07T22:31Z,"The download is missing one thing... The actual instructions to make the choirs sing what you type in..  Here is what you do:

1. Open WordBuilder
2. A voice configuration screen should appear (if it doesn't, choose File->New Voice)
3. In the Voice Type dropdown, choose Tenors (Just for this example)
4. In the MIDI In section, for MIDI Port, choose your keyboard's MIDI port
5. Leave the channel setting at 1
6. In the MIDI Out section, for MIDI Port, choose Virtual WordBuilder 1 (Mac)/Midi Yoke 1(PC)
7. Leave the channel setting at 1
8. Click OK
9. Type some words into WordBuilder
10. Open Symphonic Choirs
11. In the Symphonic Choirs player, click on the drop-down arrow next to 'NEW MULTI'
12. Choose a WB Multi. For the sake of this example, choose Full->F Tenors->F TENR WB NV
13. In the Symphonic Choirs menu, click on File->Setup
14. Click on MIDI
15. For input interface turn everything off, but turn Virtual WordBuilder 1 (Mac)/MIDI Yoke 1 (PC) on
16. For output interface, turn everything off
17. Click OK
18. Play!

,sweet_x_lady,2010-07-31T11:32Z,"Wow... people wait 2 months for this download??? LOL Mine was finished in 2 days with Bittorrent :O
Real fast and good torrent! Thanks a billion Danell! I'm now downloading your Colossus :) Do you have more? Do you have Goliath? I can't find that one nowhere :("
,paidpirate,2010-08-28T23:50Z,Is it possible to seed or download just part of this library? I don't need  ( or want to wait for) the entire 40GB library . help
,wakeupscreaming,2010-10-07T23:22Z,"My torrent is stuck at 98.09% after more than a month of downloading. It says ""Tracker returned a 4xx message"". Is the torrent now moot? I would not recommend downloading this torrent if so. 40GB's of data isn't worth the small detail of a singing choir, when you can simply use a generic choir at maybe 1MB, and have the same effect. For something I wanted to play around with, 40GB's of your harddrive can be used for thousands, if not millions of other samples. Forget it people -- don't bother with this torrent."
,duel,2010-10-27T00:58Z,"""This is the library, DON'T FORGET TO DOWNLOAD THE INSTAL!!!!""

So where's the fucking install?"
,The_Q-Stylerzz,2010-11-05T19:22Z,"It works, but I need the Authorization Key for the Registration Tool.
And I have no sound, someone can help me ???"
,Gidell,2010-11-23T16:35Z,Can someone please seed this torrent more? Thankyou!!
,elusive2,2010-12-19T00:10Z,"I've downloaded the install for Mac.  I have a systemID and I've used it to generate a serial number with the keygen on a windows machine. When I use the generated serial to get an activation code using service center I get an error ""unknown serial"".   Do they track the serials now??  Can someone tell me how to get an activation code so it will install on my machine? "
,nahoowey,2011-01-23T03:43Z,"Thanks Danell!
@Daylife33 for mentioning Midi Yoke.
In order for this program to run on the PC, you have to download a MIDI Loopback Connector. Here is a list:
loopMIDI
Maple Virtual Midi Cable
MIDI Yoke
LoopBe1 ($)
Hubi's Loopback MIDI Driver ($)

Again, Thanks to all for this cool program!"
