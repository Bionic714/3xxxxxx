,Jackass Jimm,2008-05-22T02:54Z,"Anyone else on this CD?  Don't feel like downloading it without knowing if it is good.  I'm a big fan and loved the 1st album.  The 2nd album was acceptable and good but not near the 1st albums level.  Planets, the 3rd album, was ok but I hated that Chavez wasn't the singer anymore (I believe the Singer is the most important aspect of a band and you shouldn't keep on with the same name if the lead singer isn't there).  None the less, I liked Planets.  

So, how is this album?"
,iloveTSA,2008-08-18T11:21Z,"Jackass Jimm, you've got it all wrong. See downloading music for free on the internet as a free sample, if you like it go buy it and support the artist. That's the whole idea behind it. 

So why don't you check it out yourself?

Thanks for upload, cheers."
