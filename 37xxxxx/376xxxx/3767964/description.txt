|  There?s a glitch on track 2 at 0:10, unfortunately it's like that on the  |
|  cd.                                                                       |
|                                                                            |
|  Adema formed in the California Central Valley that spawned Korn and       |
|  Videodrone. The melodic hard rock band consists of guitarist Mike         |
|  Ransom, guitarist Tim Fluckey, bassist Dave DeRoo, drummer Kris Kohls,    |
|  and singer Mark Chavez, the younger half-brother of Korn's Jonathan       |
|  Davis. Adema consists of former members of Bakersfield bands Juice and    |
|  SexArt, which included Davis and Ryan Shuck of Orgy. The lineup had been  |
|  together for a year before ever performing live. The demos they wrote in  |
|  that time secured them a deal with Arista after a major-label bidding     |
|  war, created undoubtedly because of Chavez's family lineage. Their debut  |
|  self-titled album was written in a northern California cabin where tight  |
|  quarters and a little cabin fever resulted in productive (and slightly    |
|  aggressive) sessions. Adema recorded the album in Los Angeles with        |
|  producers Bill Appleberry (7th House) and Tobias Miller (Wallflowers      |
|  guitarist). Adema was released in August 2001 and was considered by the   |
|  music industry to be a test of hitmaker and new Arista president Antonio  |
|  Reid's ability to succeed outside of the R&B genre. That success led to   |
|  a coveted main stage spot on the Ozzfest tour and certified gold record   |
|  the following year. Adema released a six-song EP, Insomniac's Dream,      |
|  before unleashing their full-length follow-up, the Howard Benson-         |
|  produced Unstable in 2003. The album was a success, but the collapse of   |
|  Arista left the group without a home, a problem soon remedied by the      |
|  indie label Earache. Besides losing support from a major, the band also   |
|  lost guitarist Mike Ransom and lead singer Mark Chavez, who left the      |
|  band to pursue other interests. After sifting through numerous other      |
|  aspiring crooners, the group settled on fellow Southern Californian Luke  |
|  Caraccioli and headed back into the studio, and the resulting Planets     |
|  was released in April 2005. This particular lineup didn't last long,      |
|  however. Caraccioli quit the band soon after the album came out, though   |
|  he was replaced the following year by Bobby Reeves, who had previously    |
|  sung in the L.A. band LEVEL, bringing along with him guitarist Ed Faris.  |
|  Signed to Immortal Records, Adema issued Kill the Headlights in summer    |
|  2007.                                                                     |
|                                                                            |
