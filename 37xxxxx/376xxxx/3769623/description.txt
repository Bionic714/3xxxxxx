The video is pretty good quality, despite the 20-25 year old nature of any VHS copies floating around. IMO, the quality is better than VHS, but not DVD Quality.

"Years after the war between the Children of Water and the Children of Fire, Oceanus, a god of the sea, presents Prince Sirius with the eye of Algarock, thereby putting him in charge of those that dwell under the waves. But when Sirius encounters a beautiful Fire Child named Malta (the daughter of the Queen of Fire), he is lost in love and defies the law that states that Children of Water and Children of Fire must forever remain separate to prevent war from breaking out once more. Sirius and Malta struggle to be together while running into obstacles. But in the end, are the echoes of history too loud to overcome or can the two lovers be united and bring peace to the land?"
