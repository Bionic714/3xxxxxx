,moreisless,2009-08-26T00:20Z,"hi. I understand how DVD players offer a choice of audio but, can divx also do this? I have this movie but the American accents make it painful listening. It is thoughtful that the original emotional tone can be enjoyed, even though I need the English subs. The audio is more important to me, so I never have any complaints about the visual side. Thanks for sharing, hope I figure it out.  "
