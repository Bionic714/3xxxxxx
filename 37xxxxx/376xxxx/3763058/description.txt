Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme is an album by Simon and Garfunkel released October 10, 1966. Its name comes from the second line of the album's first track, "Scarborough Fair/Canticle", an English folk song from the 1500s. It peaked on the U.S. charts at #4. Produced by Bob Johnston. Columbia Records LP CL 2563 (mono); CS 9363 (stereo); CD CK 9363; Remastered CD CK 66001.

The album can be seen as having a protest element in it: the closing song, "7 O'Clock News/Silent Night", contained clips of a news broadcast about the Vietnam War. Based on the fact that the broadcast carries the news of the death of comedian Lenny Bruce that day, it can be dated from 3 August 1966.

In 2003, the album was ranked number 201 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. [1]
