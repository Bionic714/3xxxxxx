,TheIdiotThatIsMe,2007-08-21T08:08Z,"To Furik:

Thanks for the comment! Dont forget to look for Release Three towards the end of August or beginning of September. I'll be including Declaration (The live part of the double album edition of Affirmation), Signal One (interview with Darren Hayes about Tension and The Spark), along with his new album in full!

Thanks for the comment, glad to know someone likes it!"

,b33znutz,2008-05-10T13:43Z,i forgot to mention that the 1st release is now dead thanks to the 2nd release (which is missing tracks) and that is the reason for my comments.
,b33znutz,2008-05-10T13:44Z,"or better yet, how about that 3rd release you promised???????"
,TheIdiotThatIsMe,2008-08-10T15:21Z,"b33znutz:
