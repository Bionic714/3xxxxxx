On Aug. 20th, 2007 Darren Hayes will be releasing his new album "This Delicate Thing We've Made"! In celebration, and to keep us busy until then, I have decided to re-release the Savage Garden and Darren Hayes Collection, with plenty of updates. 

First thing is all previously OGG files have been re-ripped to MP3 to better coincide with some of the extras, along without limiting media players on Windows. Approximately half of the music could not go OGG without transcoding the files from MP3, and to save quality decided against it.

Also (thanks to other bittorrent patrons, such as Luna and the original contributer of The Singles, Part One and Two) CD Singles are also included. Just dont forget, singes include remixes and rare songs on them as well as the album and/or radio version of the song.
