This is my attempt to create a new high quality version of Grandizer in Arabic. Grandizer is something I grew up with when I was young and I loved every minute of it. I have been searching high and wide for high quality versions of this anime in Arabic but couldnt find them anywhere online. There were a couple of so called Muslim resalers online who claimed they were doing it for no profit at about $9 a tape or DVD but they are of course lying not to mention that they arent giving anything back to the creators and pocketing every illegal penny. They also went and edited the originals to take out anything they thought was offensive which makes no sense whatsoever since they are still supporting the anime despite their objections to it. So anyway I took it on myself to get a good version out to all the Arabs out there who want to see Grandizer again in High Quality without paying some hypocrite a large sum of money only to get something that has been bastardized to one or two peoples tastes.

I am using the video from the French DVD\'s and audio from the Arabic version to make these new videos. This is just the opening so people can see what they will look like. It takes about 2-3 hours to edit each video since the audio is completely out of sync with the video rips. Hopefully I will have ep1 ready to go soon but till then this is the quality you can expect.
