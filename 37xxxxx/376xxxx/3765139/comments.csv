Step 1.-Download
Step 2.-Get a Virtual CD Tool (Like Alchohol, Daemon Tools, or Famatom DVD)
Step 3.-Mount Fable and Install (CD Key can be found in the folder labeled 'Crack')
Step 4.-When installing you get asked to switch disks just unmount the previous CD and mount the next one.

-Congrats in about 5 min you have just installed Fable!"

 will seed..

Azom game ;D"
,IllegalDownloader123,2008-10-02T15:48Z,"Thanks it works! Just finished the game yesterday :D. Will seed

For thos who don't know how to download and install here are the steps:
1. Get a torrent downloader such as:
Bit Torrent, U Torrent or Azerus.
2. Download the Torrent (should just be a few kb)
3. Double click the torrent and your torrent downloader should be downloading the file.
4. Once its down you should see the ff:
Fable Disk 1
Fable Disk 2
Fable Disk 3
Fable Disk 4

Download Daemon-Tools or Alchohol 120% (Instructions on how to use them are in their respective websites.)
5. Mount the Image (on this case Fable Disk 1) The installation should be starting as if you have the CD. When it calls for Disk 2-4 just mount them with Daemon-Tools /Alchohol.
6. Play!!!

Notes:
For the CD key go to www.serials.ws you can search serials for it there.
This is NOT crack included so you'll have to search for the crack around the web. If you don't want to download a crack (for fear of viruses, trojans etc.) Just mount Fable Disk 1 then double click the Fable The Lost Chapters Icon should work fine.

Hope this helps."

If it still doesnt work get another crack (theres on in the downoad just noticed it a week ago). If problems persist  check if your rig can run Fable.  Or maybe you did something wrong in the installation, did you by any chance move the Fable file around your drives after installation?

,Manster42002,2008-12-25T13:05Z,"The game works just fine -- As it was said previously, using Daemon Tools seems to be the easiest route to get it installed -- 
Download .iso files (obviously)
In Daemon Tools, mount disk 1 and run installation program -- 
To get the product key (there may be other ways) I simply extracted the contents of disk 1 into an empty folder -- Its in the ""crack"" folder
Once the installation program asks for disk 2, dismount the disk 1 iso and mount disk 2 and continue the same steps for disks 3 and 4 
If the game ask for disk 1 again when starting up the game, I simply just re-mounted it and hit ""Play""

Like I said, it works -- If you're still having issues, I'd suspect other PC issues being the problem -- Good luck "

,Vyrage,2010-06-15T22:35Z,"This turned out perfect. For anyone feeling a bit newbish to all this, here's what I did for a smooth result.

Your torrent's downloaded, you open it to find four rar files, disc1 through to disc 4. Highlight these four files, right click and extract them all to that same folder. Click accept to all/copy and replace all if it pops up. You've finished extracting them to your folder, now double click the setup application beneath Pigden.dll and Readme. Install everything as reccommended and then enter your CD key, which is QCK9C-BM382-KCTPH-KJCRD-PYFYY. You've finished installing so now all you need to do is mount the Fable Disk 1 file. I use PowerISO to deal with mounting, I've never had a reason to try anything else with the free unregistered version :]. Now click on autorun and enjoy! I didn't touch the Crack folder, left it where it was and I'm running Vista Home Premium. Thanks for reading the insanely newbie guide ^^."

I have used a torrent besides this one, and it installed a few times, then my comp would force-restart when I tried to switch from disc 4 to disc 1. Same thing with this torrent. Any ideas?

,omgwtfnoob,2012-05-03T11:26Z,"thanks :) this is awesome, never played the lost chapters, only the original on xbox.

anyone having trouble playing, dont unzip the iso's, just download some virtual drive software (recommend Virtual CloneDrive) - create 4 virtual drives and mount each disc, then run the first cd like a normal disc, and you wont need to change discs during the game. just remount before playing each time, not a big deal.

plays fine for me, awesome game, just how i remember it :) thanks again"
,ik0x,2012-05-15T19:34Z,"I keep getting an error while after clicking the setup application. After i enter the serial number it continues to install.

,claiho,2012-07-06T01:00Z,"DON'T UNZIP THESE! ISO are DC/DVD image files, not archives! Sure, they may be seen as archives by 7zip and similar programs but they are NOT archives. If you have 7zip or similar program associated with ISO files, remove the association.

Use CD/DVD emulator like Daemon Tools or Virtual CloneDrive and mount these."

I used magicISO to mount on windows vista.
mount disc 1, then go to examine disc contents and run AutoRun.exe"
,NoGoodGamers,2012-08-03T08:20Z,"okay, I have use daemon tools to mount all 4 disks ( in sequence, when prompted in the installation ), and now it created a desktop icon and then I restarted my computer ( needed for installation ). So I went into the games folder that I created for all my games, double clicked, and I waited for like 5 minutes and it didn't open! I am still waiting really, now it's been about 10, 15... So I was wondering if I installed it wrong or if I didn't do something right. some help would be nice, tahnks"
