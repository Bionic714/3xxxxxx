Shaolin Dolemite (1999)

Plot:	Rudy Ray Moore, of "Dolemite" fame, took this insane old kung fu film ("Ninja: The Final Duel") and spliced himself in and re-dubbed the entire thing. Total insanity!

Overview:	The Godfather Of Rap and original Blaxploitation superstar Rudy Ray Moore (Dolemite) locks fists with master kung fu director Robert Tai ("Five Deadly Venoms") in the very first martial arts blaxploitation comedy ever made.

Monk Ru-Dee of the Dolemite Clan goes on an action-filled odyssey into deepest China in search of Twopac, the Westside Monk, to bring him to justice. Deadly obstacles stand in Ru-Dee's way: the Vampire Bronzemen, the topless Ninja Ho, and the dreaded Ninja Clan of Japan. Ru-Dee must consult the wisdom of Abbot White (Robert Tai) and commences to hilariously kick ass with the help of the Clan of the Wu Tang and the Shabazz Tribe (The East Side Monks).

Extraordinary dubbing, complete irreverence, and some of the most brilliant fight choreography ever shot make "Shaolin Dolemite" an outstanding introduction to the new millennium's most original entertainment form: the marriage of Hong Kong action and the brilliance of the blaxploitation genre.
