,Truble_T,2007-08-09T00:10Z,"hey malomeat. could you upload the select file that you used in the screenshots? the one that you included does not have all the characters in the screens, i know that you can edit the file yourself, but if you could upload yours that would be easier than manually entering all the characters. thanks.

,StolenSoulz,2007-09-01T03:08Z,"Downloaded today, nothing but errors when trying to unpack the rar.....any ideas?"
,onemicmike,2007-09-07T10:21Z,"The 516stars screenpack seemed to work the best for me. (open mugen omega and select 516 stars under the dropdown file)

-To put the characters in, go under ""characters"" file and open the readme. There's a bunch of characters names with order's already typed. 

-Open the ""data"" file then ""516stars."" Then right click ""select.def"" and click edit. Then maximize that notepad window. Scroll down to where it says ""-------1danme-----------"" and under that there will be a bunch of ""random select.""

-Copy and paste names from the characters reame over the ""random selects."" and that'll put in a bunch of characters. don't forget to save the select.def or the characters will not show up in 516stars. To enter the rest of the chars, you'll need to look under ""characters"" (there's a ton here) and look at the names of the ones you want (like the nude ones and whatnot). just type the name of the character exactly as it appears over those ""randomselect"" mentioned before and put , , (comma space comma) and an order=(whatever number 1-10). Should look something like this ""AngelRyu, ,order=2"" (no quotes). After that Angel Ryu will be selectable after you hit save on the select.def and open 516stars. 

All this took me forever to figure out, but it works. If there's an easier way someone knows, feel free to tell me!"
,NeoEspiritus,2007-11-03T19:30Z,Anyone know why i get dr. watson error message when i press start at loading screen?
,NeoEspiritus,2007-11-03T20:42Z,Hm. Apparently the character BMG was causing mine to crash. Took that one out and works fine. :D
,joemofo619,2007-12-20T04:03Z,"will i have to download the mugen thing or is already in here, cuz i want it ready to go"
,HylianTX,2008-01-04T10:34Z,"Ok, How about making it work now PLZ/ Thanks


It jsut crashes after the loading screen, and all the others won't load the characters. the only one that did was the 516Stars thing, and the images were all over the place and i couldn't make them out for shit. PLease make this work "
,CrackelNL,2008-01-24T21:19Z,Seed (A) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,SirReno7,2008-03-12T05:37Z,"At FIRST I agreed with HylianTX.  I couldn't get past the loading screen, without: the exe ""has encountered a problem and needs to close""

...But THEN, I tried doing what NeoEspiritus said.  I went into the data folder, opened ""select.def"" and deleted ""bmg""

Now everything works FINE.

To make the graphics smoother, I recommend opening ""mugen.cfg"" and changing

DoubleRes =4

to

DoubleRes =2

Also, by default, the game seemed a bit too fast for me, so I went into options & changed the speed from fast9 to fast4 (but that's just a matter of PERSONAL preference).  From there, I simply reconfigured my controller, and was all set.  (I use the Gravis Gamepad Pro -- a PSX style controller, which I configure like Street Fighter 2 on the good old SNES controller, back when Fierce punch was the ""L"" button, etc...)  ...again, a simple matter of preference.

Thanks very much for this excellent mugen pack.  I originally downloaded it just so I could incorporate some of its characters & stages into my OWN mugen (not for release or anything...  i simply mean my own, customized winmugen, which I've been tinkering with (mixing different screenpacks, with other life bars, and custom ""fight.snd,"" and ""system.snd,"" etc., exclusively for my own entertainment)...  But this pack is so good, that I might just end up changing that plan to:
Incorporating MY characters & stages into THIS pack, and calling it a day :)"
,CtaiXtine,2008-05-07T17:48Z,Could anyone please explain how to load characters  into the game
,Pirate_Kings_Cometh,2008-05-18T19:53Z,"I think this could be the one Mugen needed to complete my collection, will seed as long as some helps me download right now"
,ShutUpFoo,2008-08-21T20:29Z,She's a sloooow one!
,Baconator,2008-09-17T01:01Z,"Not worth the DL, Just a bunch of unbalanced characters and kanye west music. I mean seriously why do you need 10 Goku's."
,malomeat,2008-09-24T03:45Z,Would you really download it without looking at what was in it first?
,Chronoblimp,2008-10-19T10:39Z,"If your having problems getting the game to load (crashes after the press enter screen) you need to 

1. open the select.dff file in the data directory
2. find bmg by a text search or by scrolling down to the entry in the file
3. delete the bmg entry

This is because this character causes the game to crash in this version.. everything should work fine after this (it did for me)"
