E slovenac,


Can somebody make one DVD-R outta two torrents, please?



Download menu, extras and subtitles from this torrent:
http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/3606080/Romancing_the_Stone_(Robert_Zemeckis__1988)_[eng-ger-esp].3606080.TPB.torrent


Then download only the movie form this one:
http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/3763207/Romancing_the_Stone_(1984).3763207.TPB.torrent



Use this two torrents to rebuild the DVD and make ONE, perfect, full DVD of this great movie!
Then upload it here...  :)

I would be very thankful if someone could assist me in accomplishing this."
