This California-based guitarist was actually born in Germany. His inspiration and style are similar to that of another German immigrant, Deuter, who co-produced and performed on Govi's debut album Sky High. Like Deuter, Govi spent a number of years living and studying in India, where he added sitar to his vocabulary of acoustic and electric guitars, mandola, and cello.Govi's music gained in popularity in the 1990s, with the expansion of peoples awareness of world music and a renewed passion for flamenco, spawning new age hit albums like Andalusian Nights and Passion and Grace. His music is a gentle, melodious combination of influences from around the world.
