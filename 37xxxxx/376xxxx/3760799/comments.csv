,valerieG,2009-06-19T11:46Z,Thanks! Good quality for the ones I have watched so far. I seed this torrent when online.
,valerieG,2009-06-19T11:49Z,"And Zibby, you complain about a 11.7GB torrent taking 2 days?! Wow, it took me a few weeks to get this one. The other torrent with all the episodes has been active for 8 months, and is still at only 10.5%! I am giving up on that one even though it has many more seeders than this one for some reason."
,illenium123,2010-05-10T01:18Z,plz seed!
,theRealKarmine,2011-06-23T01:37Z,consider you got 11gb of video in 2 days instead of taking 2 hours to download 30mb on a 56k.  quit yer bitchin and prioritize the files so you can watch them one at a time.
