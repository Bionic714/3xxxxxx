The Conflict2142 Mod is a simple to use executable file (.exe)

*Please note to remember where you downloaded the file

*Quick Tip : Making an Intstaller Folder
â?¢ Make a new folder on your desktop, name it "Installers"
â?¢ Anytime you download an Installer, Executable, or any other file that will place a program into you computer - download it here and you will always know where to find it again in case you have to un-install the program for any reason.

Now open the folder where the CF2142 v1.04.exe is located and double-click it to execute/run.

Follow the prompts and leave the directory where it would like to install it alone.

*For advanced users who have intalled your BF2142 into another drive : E, F, G, etc. then please change the directory listed as needed for correct install.

Now after it installs there will be two shortcuts on your desktop :
â?¢ CF2142 CD --> This is if you have the Disk Version
â?¢ CF2142 DL --> This is if you have the EA Downloader Version

Delete the one you do not need!

If your shortcuts do not work for some reason:

Right-click and select properties

Now for each shortcut it is different so here you are:

CF2142 CD
Target: = "C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Battlefield 2142\BF2142.exe" +menu 1 +fullscreen 1 +modPath mods/CF2142
Start In: = "C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Battlefield 2142"

CF2142 DL 
Target: = "C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Battlefield 2142\BF2142Launcher.exe" +menu 1 +fullscreen 1 +modPath mods/CF2142
Start In: = "C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Battlefield 2142"

Now Shortcuts should work!

Map Install Instructions below!

Also all your new Custom Maps need to go into this folder now
--> C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Battlefield 2142\mods\CF2142\Levels

Custom Maps Install instructions :

C: Drive (Or the folder you installed 2142 into)
Program Files
Electronic Arts folder
Battlefield 2142 folder
mods folder
CF2142 folder
Levels folder

Which reads --> C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Battlefield 2142\mods\CF2142\Levels

Unzip/Extract the map and drop into the levels folder. Close everything back up and your done.

It is your responsibility to have the Maps downloaded before Practice and Battles, they are located in the announcements thread and titled Battle # ; # = Current Battle Number. New versions may be released throughout the day on some occasions so your best option is to be on a few minutes early depending on your Internet Connection speed to have the new map version downloaded and ready for WAR!
