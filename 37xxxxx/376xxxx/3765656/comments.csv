,Sleighand,2007-08-09T18:23Z,"I'm not sure if there's a virus/adware in this or not but after installing only ANYDVD HD I keep getting two spoolsv.exe processes running under Windows Task Manager. One of them displays as ""unresponsive"" under the Applications tab. Even after uninstalling it the problem didn't go away. Now I'm trying to figure out how to remove that extra spoolsv.exe.
