,Reck One,2008-09-13T23:30Z,"how do people today not believe what the freedom of information act confirms under the title MK ULTRA, and abc reported back in 1979?

why are so many people so ready to comdemn something before investigating it?

why is your conception of this world, so fragile, that you would deny the existence of something, because it's not a part of what you encounter on a daily basis. 

the bible has a good term that applies to people of this nature, and that is willingfully ignorant.

you are now free to go back to your football game, video game, sitcom, movie, or whatever it is that you do to entertain yourself all the while telling yourself that we're all crazy, just do the rest of us a favor, before you open your mouth, have something intelligent to say other than your uninformed opinion.

The U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a law ensuring public access to U.S. government records. FOIA carries a presumption of disclosure; the burden is on the government - not the public - to substantiate why information may not be released. Upon written request, agencies of the United States government are required to disclose those records, unless they can be lawfully withheld from disclosure under one of nine specific exemptions in the FOIA. This right of access is ultimately enforceable in federal court.
