,seagle88,2009-03-22T09:34Z,Firesign Theater is not a well known comedy group. They did produce a number of pieces but We're all bozos it the best known. I owned the original LP of childs garden of grass and their name was not mentioned. It was touted as a prelegalization album in the mid 70's so they may not have wanted criminal reprecussions. I'm not clean and sober 20 years and it is still a kick!!!!!!
