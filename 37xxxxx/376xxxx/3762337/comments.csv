,guitarsNthings,2010-11-29T09:00Z,"The songs on Nimrod are largely out of order. I had to change the names for at least four of the songs. Please check to make sure they're right. The most obvious ones were the songs labeled Jinx, Last Ride In and Walking Alone."
,guitarsNthings,2010-11-29T09:05Z,"To append my last comment, the tracks should be (in order):

1) Nice Guys Finish Last
2) Hitchin' a Ride
3) The Grouch   
4) Redundant
5) Scattered   
6) All The Time   
7) Worry Rock   
8) Platypus (I Hate You)   
9) Uptight
10) Last Ride In*
11) Jinx*
12) Haushinka*   
13) Walking Alone*   
14) Reject*
15) Take Back   
16) King for a Day   
17) Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)
18) Prosthetic Head

The starred tracks are the ones I noticed were out of order and mis-titled."
