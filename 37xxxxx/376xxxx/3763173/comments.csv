,Playbum,2008-04-21T12:11Z,"Seeding is done simply by leaving the file in the folder you downloaded it to, and the program you used (utorrent/opera/?) running."
,altss,2008-10-29T22:13Z,"no to seed (at least in bitlord), you have to keep the file in operational mode. it will seed and show you your upload speed until you push the stop button, at which point you are no longer seeding. you can seed files you have already downloaded by pushing the 'play' button (in bitlord)"
,majorhavoc20,2009-01-03T05:16Z,Roxasftw you forgot to mention seeders are known to jam transmissions.
