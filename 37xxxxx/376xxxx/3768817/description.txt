* These games, unlike those you find on shadyroms, will save.

Shadyroms requires Mozilla FireFox to use. So if you donâ??t like Mozilla, use this instead.
Any requests will be put in a separate torrent. Some of these are kids games or have stupid controls or gfx, but at the time I was just downloading random English games. If you donâ??t like â??em, just go ahead and donâ??t use and/or delete them. There are plenty of good GBA games there.

Also Check out the Visualboy advance rars, unrar them to be able to play the games. There are two versions though that I have. They are able to use different gameshark codes, so whichever gameshark codes, or whatever kind of codes you use, you may have to use a different VBA for them.

Also, NO$GBA.rar contains all you need to start playing Pokemon Diamond and Pearl, plus two or three other working games. These included games work PERFECTLY, if slow at times.

Vbalink.rar allows you to connect your VBAs together. Which will be useful for pokemon. Or you could use codes to get all the pokemon. Thatâ??s possible too.
