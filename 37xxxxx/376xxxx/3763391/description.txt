This is every file I could find to make Speech Recognition work in Windows games.

These files aren't for talking to other people, they're for talking back and forth to your computer (text to speech and speech recognition).

There's a good chance you'll need to run one of the SDK 5.1 files from MS Speech Enablers to make anything work at all, and it shouldn't hurt to run the VB 6 runtime either.

The Voice Command part of the Plus Pack should work in place of SDK 5.1. Or, MS Office if you have it enables speech as well. Hopefully by then your favorite Voice Recognition software will work fine.

Don't ask me how to make all these work, I haven't had time to play much. : (

!!! Game Commander has a weird custom installer, I think it's OK but I haven't tested this stuff. !!!

If you like any of the software pay for it, and please seed this torrent if you liked it !

Put a thumbs up wherever you found this torrent, and support your favorite site!

Seed me long time!

Most especially, enjoy the heck out of talking to and listening to your favorite games!
