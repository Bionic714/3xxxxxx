,H-Cyber,2009-03-14T02:58Z,"Well, I'll be damned... I was just checking whether someone uploaded Game Commander 3, and I found this torrent; then I read the description.

Nooo way! Game Commander with weird custom installer?

[frantic clicking and one minute later]

I'll be damn. It's mine! :D

Story? Once upon a time, some 4-6 years ago, there was this very swell place called niteshdw.com, a place for all torrents Sci-Fi. Star Trek & Star Wars, Doctor Who & the original BSG, Blake's 7 - this site had it all. Someone then mentioned ""Star Trek: Bridge Commander"" which resulted with the inevitable mention of Game Commander as the most advanced and immersive way of control. So, I made a torrent. My first torrent. My baby. :D
My ""online persona"" in those days gone by was ""The Borg Collective"", thus all the plural and characteristic phrases; after all, I was catering to a very specific and familiar public :). Ah, good ol' days.
Soon after MPAA closed the site; the only thing left were forums, then reappropriated as a general Sci-Fi community forum. Now, even that is gone. Niteshdw now only lives in a memory of us few... Good old days indeed.

... 

Anyways:
I here by can guarantee that the custom installer for Game Commander 2.0.0.14 included in this torrent is completely safe for use; it uses a custom-built AutoItScript-based launcher that displays a message urging the then-members of the NiteShdw to seed, a big problem then (ain't it ever?), but not before asking you whether you read the ""Assimilate This!.txt"" file [Borg version of ""ReadMe.txt""]. Then it proceeds with installation: runs setup, you choose where to install it, registers the program; then runs update to v2.2... and that's about it.

Now, I'm running a somewhat problematic install of Windows Server 2003, so setup process is just sitting there and going nowhere. It might be error on my part, might be my current OS installation, or the even-originally problematic and slooooow-to-start setup of GC2. Under Vista, I know my AutoIt Container will run as usual, but I'm not so sure about the original GC2 setup.
Anyways, all of this is explained in the ""Assimilate First!"" file. It ain't exactly your everyday release ReadMe file... :)

There's one thing that could be rated ""dangerous""...
Just make sure you comply with Uncle Sam's request:
first, he'll ask you to seed. If you click ""no"", he'll urge you to reconsider; if you AGAIN refuse to cooperate (come on, it's a goddamn dialog box!) there's gonna be a consequence: you refused to seed, and he'll - as a result - delete the GC2 installation file, forcing you to download it again.
If you - however - respond to his plea, the installation will be executed and will proceed as planned.
It's a funny thing, really - make a copy of the folder after you extract it and try it; if you don't trust me, do in inside a Virtual machine or Quarantined zone. What can I say - I couldn't resist making it back then, and again testing it right now. The original scripts and files are still lurking in the deep confines of my HDDs. :)

So, that's it. I really must say it's quite a thrill to find out that something you made so long ago is still alive and well. :)"
,H-Cyber,2009-03-14T03:07Z,"And yeah, I forgot this one:

Do a search on TPB for ""niteshdw"", you'll still see a few remnant torrents, now running over TPB. :)"
[T],Huggybaby,2009-03-14T19:36Z,"Awesome, thank you for the history H-Cyber!

I'm glad I could keep your installer alive. This torrent is getting old now but it keeps on going.

You know, it was hard as hell finding your torrent when I was compiling this one. :)"
,H-Cyber,2009-03-17T10:35Z,Really? So where did ya found it in the end?
[T],Huggybaby,2009-03-20T15:36Z,"I don't remember, that was some time ago. :)"
