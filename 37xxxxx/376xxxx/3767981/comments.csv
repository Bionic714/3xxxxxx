Any suggestions? Anyone? "

Actually to make the choir sing the written thing (I wirte in VOTOX btw) do you need actually a keyboard plugged in? Because mine's broken and I can't use it so.. is there another way to input the notes?"

You need to use MFXshell to let FL understand Wordbuilder. Worked fine for me.

,HKt0p5,2008-10-25T17:01Z,"Too bad, stuartyeadon, thanks for your help, but after I did the combination you posted, my computer totally crashed.

Guess I'll use only the Symphonic Choirs and edit manually."
