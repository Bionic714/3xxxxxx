,pip1,2007-08-07T14:26Z,"Eydan 
can you set your client to super seeding and drop your connected peers to 6 or less to get the first 100% out here as quick as possible so others can help feed the compleate data?.

there seems to be only one seed , i assume it you, and it looks like your spread to thin to get the 100% finished.

the sweedish guys can feed a lot very fast so connect to them ove other peers would eb best."
,pip1,2007-08-07T15:26Z,"who's the guy on 91.2% 
193.108.234.101 thats giving up a crappy 260B/s after a whole 30 minutes connected, come on play the game mate, everyone else is on 3.2% cut your peers to say  6 and upload to them as quick as you can, then everyone might get some to share.

the single 100% is connected but doesnt seem to be giving out any data at on one on 3.2 has changed % in over 12 minutes.

is there something wrong with your setting and its not uploading?....just sat there?."

,Namibio,2009-12-11T02:23Z,"I can't be more happy with this torrent. At last, someone is seeding knowledge instead of crap (i.e. Porn, bad movies, MJ's ep's, etc).

I can't thank you enough, Eydan for your contribution to spread knowledge worldwide.

As always, seed people. It didn't cost you a dime, it won't cost you another dime to share."
