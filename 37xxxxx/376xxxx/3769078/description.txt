? 	Bill Tyler (Charlton Heston) and Henry Frapp (Brian Keith) 
are The Mountain Men, the roughest, toughest pair of fur trappers who 
ever trekked across the North American wilderness. But while masters 
in the fields of shooting, drinking and cussing, their greatest talents lie 
in outrunning hostile Indians- an activity that takes up most of their time. 
So when they learn that their latest traveling companion, Running Moon 
(Victoria Racimo), is really a chief's runaway squaw, Bill and Henry must 
decide what's more important: the girl or their scalps. The Mountain Men 
soon agree on the only honorable course of action- to put as much 
distance between Running Moon and themselves as possible.
