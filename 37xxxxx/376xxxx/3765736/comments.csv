Still. This is not how animals are handled everywhere. But guess that would kinda ruin the whole guilttrip. =P"
,grinreaper_CCE,2007-08-08T01:16Z,Naah... not if hopefully most people realize that supermarket meat usually originates in industrial farming... and go from there. The money hoarders behind the food industry cannot afford maintaining both mainstream consumer prices and well kept after animals at the same time.
