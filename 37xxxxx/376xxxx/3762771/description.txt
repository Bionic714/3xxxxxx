Comedian, writer and politically incorrect HBO talk-show host Bill Maher takes time off from his regular hosting duties to perform a hilariously scathing stand-up set in this comedy special. Airing live from the Berklee Performance Center in Boston, this one-hour special features Maher's acerbic takes on a wide range of social and political issues, including the follies and foibles perpetrated on America by President George W. Bush. (TVMA) (AC,AL)
