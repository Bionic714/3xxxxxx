Lego Racers 2 ""Not enough memory"" error FIX!!!

For XP: I got this error because I have 3gb of memory which is more than this ""install"" memory test was programmed for. You can physically remove some memory sticks or virtually do it with msconfig, install the game, & enjoy! My 8 years old loves it!

Run msconfig > General tab > select: Selective Startup & ""Use Modified BOOT.INI"" > BOOT.INI tab > Advanced Options > select /MAXMEM= 2048, reboot, install game: mount Lego_Racers_2.img file with DAEMON Tool (""all files"" to see it), play! Don't forget the undo the /MAXMEM= 2048, Selective Startup and reboot so your pc goes back to using it's max memory settings.

Once installed with the /MAXMEM= 2048 workaround, it will play fine when going back to your full memory. I guess it's a similar fix with Vista or Win 7 if ran under ""XP compatibility"" & 2048 max memory limit.

Search the web for ""Lego Racers 2: Secrets FAQ"" for great tips about the game.

It's a really fun game for kids (older ones too), well worth the trouble for installing it. :-)

P.S. I tried tuttefia13 's suggestion  it did not work for me."

,VampGod,2011-11-02T10:21Z,"DUDE!!! Doesnt even fucking work, i burned it to a CD and it still doesnt work... SAME FUCKING FILE!!!"
,lionbums,2011-12-25T03:07Z,"I can't seem to fix the ""Not Enough Memory"" problem. I tried tuttefia13's method but I could not find Windows XP in the drop down menu, then I tried pxpx's method but I could not select ""Modified BOOT.INI"". 

Also for all the people who can't seem to make it work: you don't burn it to a disc. You get a program called PowerIso (Which you can get free from thepiratebay) and mount the image to a drive, then you can run the installation. On PowerIso there is a button that says ""Mount"", you just press that and select the Lego Racers.img and it opens a folder, which contains the installation. Good luck and please help me with the Not Enough Memory thing!"
,lionbums,2011-12-25T03:08Z,"@VampGod

You don't burn this to a disc. It will just burn the .img file onto the disc. You need a program to open the .img file (read my first post!). "
,lionbums,2011-12-25T03:10Z,"If you get ""No CD Inserted"" or can't find a crack, then you are doing something wrong. Daemon Tools seems to not work for this file, which is why I use PowerIso. It worked for all my .iso or .img files. You don't need a crack or CD. Good luck"
,lionbums,2011-12-25T05:20Z,I can play until I select my first vehicle and it starts loading the first map. It finishes loading then crashes to the desktop. Any fixes to that?
,alphageddert,2012-01-27T04:19Z,"i had the asking for a cd problem and i figured out the solution. i had made the mistake of installing the game from a file. here is the step by step of how i made it work
1. open power iso and click mount and select a drive.
2. go to start menu, computer, and select the drive that says lego racers 2 make sure you select the one on the righthand side of your screen.
3. all the files inside the img file will no be visible. click the install folder and then click setup. make sure that you install the program from here.
once it is setup click the file that says browse and you are gooood to goooooo"
,alphageddert,2012-01-27T04:29Z,"as for the not enough memory... shut off your laptop take out the battery, remove one of your ram cards, turn your computer back on, install the game, put the ram card back and it will be installed and work fine"

THERE IS NO IMG IN THIS FILE THAT IS MOUNTABLE WITH DAEMON OR ANY OTHER MOUNTING PROGRAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HELP?!?!?!"
,daardevil,2012-03-11T11:04Z,"HOW TO INSTALL IT ON WINDOWS 7 / ""Not enough memory FIX""!!!!(tested on 64bit version):
1. Mount .img file with daemon tools
2. Open mounted image folder.
4. use right mouse button on ""browse"" file then ""properties"" then ""compatibility"" then select ""run this program in compatibility mode for: windows xp(service pack 3) also check the ""disable visual themes"", ""disable desktop composition"" and ""run this program as and administrator"" boxes.
5. Click apply, then okey.
6. Do the same for ""setup"" and ""lego racers 2"" file in the ""install"" folder
7. Now, run ""browse"" file, select language and install game.
8. Have a FUN :)"
,Kingkillern,2012-04-05T12:05Z,for people having problems with the IMG mounting. you got to go into deamon tools and mount it that way not by mounting it via launching the file

,Magic_friendly,2012-07-26T00:43Z,"Follow Daredevil's steps one by one. I have Windows Vista 32-Bit and it kept saying the same ""Not enough RAM"" thing on me as well. 

1. Mount the game with an ISO program (DAEMON Tools, Alcohol, etc.) You can find full versions of this here at The Pirate Bay! I use DAEMON Tools Pro, it works best for me.

2. Go into the Install folder.

3. Right-clicking the setup file and go into properties.

4. Go to compatibility tab and click on ""Compatibility Mode"", choosing Windows XP (I have Service Pack 2 and he had 3, I guess they both work alright)

5. Then click on setup, install it.

6. After installing, NEVER run the game or create a desktop shortcut, UNLESS the game doesn't need a crack.

7. Go un-mount the image and find the game in your C: Drive, testing it to make sure it works without being mounted, as some games actually must stay MOUNTED to run! I have to do this for Dino Crisis 2 and Diablo 2's Expansion.

8. If it loads up fine, then have fun! =) Thanks a lot! Game works great man!

P.S. Idk if it's just for me, but the game image DOES need to stay mounted to play.

Looks like I haven't learned my lesson yet, now I have to re-download it again! 
In this case, (seeing how I am using Vuze) Go to your Vuze program and right-click the finished file, Force Re-Check it and it will instantly re-download again. 

Just a tip for all the bitches who complain like whiny ass pussies and can't figure shit out on their own, and the people who actually know jack shit about computer. =)
