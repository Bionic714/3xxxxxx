,fireheart99,2009-01-08T06:54Z,"Unfortunately this is not the full version.  The full version was aired only in Canada and is 45mn long without commercials (so it aired for an hour).  It has some real gems... like the ""headtripper"" sketch where he makes fun of how people act when they get high... and also a great part where he pretends to have a nervous breakdown in front of the audience.  Also... there are some clips of him doing odd things outside of the show, and a very short cartoon toward the end.  I have the full show, converted to DVD from a copy of the show that a friend in Canada sent me ten years ago.  If anyone wants a copy, all I ask for is enough to cover the disc and shipping.  Feel free to contact me at donnasbox @ hotmail dot com."
