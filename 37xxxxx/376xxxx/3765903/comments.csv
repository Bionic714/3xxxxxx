,OZZ1E,2008-05-11T16:11Z,Queen - Under Pressure.mp3 >> WITH DAVID BOWIE .. that fucker should die .. CANT find the fucking original song :@
,slappypyne,2008-05-22T19:42Z,I'm not sure there is a version without Bowie. I remember 20 years ago two friends of mine getting into an argument because one was convinced that the song was a Queen song and the other was sure it was a Bowie song. It's a chocolate/peanut butter situation.

,MossadUK,2008-05-30T11:37Z,In reference to the David Bowie comment.  Queen collaborated with Bowie in 1981 the track Under Pressure.
