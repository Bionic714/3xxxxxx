Imagine my surprise when I was expecting the swedish techno-metal-industrial-something-other guy Pain and gets some lame ass semi-retarded pop guy singing crappy music with crappy lyrics..  

Heh, I guess I should have looked into what the hell this discopgraphy really included before DL'ing it.. "

,th3t1nm4n,2007-12-14T02:34Z,"Awesome band, I first heard of them on Springman Records' ""Punk Rock Strike"" compilation album series. To clarify, this is Pain the American ska/ska-punk band. Their song ""Jabberjaw"" was in a music video on Cartoon Network a while back and they're damn good.

Thanks for throwing this torrent together, these albums are hard to find."
,reptoid,2008-02-05T03:10Z,Uh...Galactic FAIL
,Scyron,2008-04-24T22:31Z,"Get over it, idiots. You expected the name ""Pain"" to be exactly what you are looking for?

And thank you, theemotron, I've been looking for a torrent of this for some time. I'll try to contribute to seeding it."
,vileeighty,2008-08-08T06:12Z,"The latest comments about some strange Swedish band has been bothering me, so I looked them up and they're some ""dark"" semi-spiritual-afterwordly-industrial-metal-type band. So, seriously, do you think a band like that would make an album called ""Midgets With Guns""? 

Proof that swedish metal makes you stupid."
,africansk8er,2008-10-26T21:11Z,"Thank you for this, it's freaking impossible to find this. THANKS!!!1!"
,HippieJoe,2009-07-19T18:49Z,Please seed. I'm almost done. 
,wheelers,2009-09-18T00:12Z,Please seed!
,Ruscal,2010-01-29T16:24Z,"I used to see these guys play in Pensacola when I was younger. I lost all their stuff over the years, great to see someone else didn't."
,Metal4ever88,2011-06-16T05:40Z,"vileeighty: ""Proof that swedish metal makes you stupid.""  That has to be one of the most idiotic things I have seen anybody say.  Yeah, the people that were expecting this to be the Swedish metal band are stupid (you don't hear about many metal bands using album titles such as Wonderful Beef),  I'll grant you that.  But don't insult us metalheads for listening to Swedish metal.  A lot of my favorite bands are Swedish & I'm pretty damn positive my IQ has not dropped at all since I started listening to them."
