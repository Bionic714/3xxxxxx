Dude[?], you got lucky that time, unraring is not the way to deal with ISO files, you either have to mount them with Deamon Tools or something like that, or burn them to a disc with Nero or Alcohool.

Plus that unraring never works with copy-protected disc images =P"

I don't even know if .pak files are supposed to be mountable files or not?  Cause I think they're just data files?  Do you or do you NOT need to mount any images?  Should I re-install?

For all of you whose games will not save I found the solution.
Download the original The Sims, the very first one without the expansions from somewhere else, and install it.
There must have just been some basic files missing or something. Works fine after that!

PS I am running a laptop with no issues at all, the download took about 1 day and the install took me no more than 1 hour. So don't be afraid to put it on your lappy.

,xXGavUkXx,2009-03-19T16:13Z,"Really bad game to play, bad graphics (I do have a good graphics card) and also the game fails to save when you want it to. Installs fine tho but still i would'nt recommend downloading it waste of time."
,superstar69,2009-03-30T01:45Z,how do i seed?
,atlantisisdead,2009-07-15T22:56Z,"Well, I don't get this thing about long long installations. Are you sure you aren't referring to download time? That can take a while with torrents, especially big ones. Downloading is not installing. But if there is something about this torrent which requires an installation process which so many of you are saying takes hours, I don't want it."
,OopaLoopa,2009-11-01T21:09Z,"I'm too thankfull for this torrent but I do understand why 99% of the people who download this don't seed afterwards! The ""good guy"" buys his stuff and the ""bad guy"" steals it! And we aren't paying so we must be the bad guys. haha"
,OopaLoopa,2009-11-01T21:11Z,"But on the other hand bad guys don't download ""the sims"" haha!"
,MissMurder92,2010-03-05T06:27Z,"TheGoose31:

i'm not too familiar with how to necessarily work this ISO stuff and what does mounting mean? I don't have this Daemon Tools program but I have a windows vista with DivX player or NTI CD Maker so could you explain to me how i would get this game to work? I already downloaded the torrent aswell."
,MissMurder92,2010-03-05T09:27Z,i just downloaded daemon tools lite would that be satisfactory?
,Father_Time,2010-04-07T00:48Z,"Something wrong with the file.  Cannot save games or houses, my sims don't even show up on the screen, the game does not allow me to evict or bulldoze houses.  Has anyone else had these problems, and if so are they something I can fix?"
,kingkukel21,2010-09-13T13:35Z,"can i use all expansion pack all together ????

reply plss"
,tlbvsdf,2010-11-17T03:05Z,"To everyone with TROUBLE SAVING:
The game doesn't work right with Windows 7 and probably not vista.  To fix, right click the .exe, click Properties, and under the Compatibility tab, check the box next to ""Run this program in compatibility mode for:"" and choose ""Windows XP (Service Pack 2).  Then click OK and the game should run fine.

My game was a complete failure, deleting homes and families after creating them, unable to save anything.  This fixed it and I just played for like 8 hours, everything working fine."
,andyjungle,2011-01-04T23:33Z,yeah getting that same problem asking me to put in the first disc of making magic... sucks...

,MIMAGIC69,2011-12-17T21:15Z,"Amazing! works perfectly. Had been looking for this for awhile... I have sims 2 and have sims 3 on my BB, but nothing beats the original. thanks, great upload! "
,jlp1824,2012-03-19T17:02Z,i downloaded and mounted. everything works great but it wont let me play in live mode. it works great in build and buy mode but wont even let me click on live mode..?
,seanscott01,2012-04-16T17:02Z,"I can't move in a family and play in live mode. The family disappears in the actual game, I can build and buy items and everything except that I can't click Live Mode. Anyone had encountered and solved this? I will really appreciate help! Good upload anyways."
,bosslaydee,2012-04-17T21:05Z,uhm.. how the fuck do i play it? theres nothing in the 8-in-1 folder..
,Frozenfucker,2012-04-30T01:16Z,"I have some problems, and it seems that only one other person here has the same one as me. I've installed it but when I try to start the game it just says ""To continue with the installation, please insert Disk 1 och The Sims Makin' Magic into the CD-ROM drive and click OK."" Anyone know what I did wrong? Cause this has never happened to me before."
,prentsel_101,2012-04-30T12:32Z,"Hey! awesome torrent! Works perfectly well on my pc.
But could you do a sims 2 or 3 just like this one as well? i can't even buy them in my city and i really wanna try them out.. i'll seed for MONTHS is you could do that.
all the other torrents are either too big or too complicated for near noobs like me. :'("
,JMDOV27,2012-07-17T16:42Z,"I'm another person who can't get into live mode. Build and buy work perfectly, but it won't let me move in a family or go to live mode. Any ideas?"
,arjuna25,2012-07-22T05:21Z,pls help me!!!! keeps crashing to desktop. windows 7.
,shereva,2012-07-31T17:01Z,"For those of you who cannot use live mode/can't save your game/can't move in a family, I had the same problem. I'm running Windows 7. I'm not sure which of the two things I did fixed it, but I did these things:

1) Right click on the Sims.exe in the Maxis folder, put it in Windows 2000 compatibility mode. Experiment a little, your computer might use a different OS.
2) Check the box ""run as administrator"" and allow it when you boot up the .exe to change the system. I think not allowing that was a problem since it wouldn't allow me to change data or save if I wasn't running as an admin.

Now my game is working perfectly. Thanks for the torrent! Good luck everyone!"
,stixr,2012-08-12T14:35Z,"Hello!

when im starting the game it's supposed to launch a ""starting"" screen where i can adjust the resolution but it wont show. and i can't seem to adjust it in game. help anyone?"
,jonc45,2012-08-14T01:31Z,"@Lollisch, go to control panel and go to Add or Remove Programs (XP) or Programs and Features (vista/7) and find the sims games on the list."
