[T],bathurst_guy,2007-08-16T09:59Z,There's enough description in the name of the iso - after all that is the name of the CD - you just need to do some research and know whats what.

You have the serial key?
this office is REALLY hard to find
and is the only that works in Mac os 10.0 through 10.2, beacuase OpenOffice o NeOffice don't work in these earlys versions of OS X"
