it is full of errors and dubious facts.

they dont even begin to cover using a straight razor, and saying things like it is difficult and dangerous to use and therefor almost no one used/use tem, that is totaly wrong.
the ""being dangerous"" is from the massive gilette campaign to get people to use his safety razor.

and for it to be dificult to use , well it is in the beginning but so is almost everything that is worth doing.

so throw away your plastic ""8 blades,sponge,cream and aftershave in one"" razor and try using a straight razor instead"

So instead its easier to make the show, into the commercial it self. But anyway, alot of the shows on National Geographic and Discovery Channel is hidden commercials. Just look at how its made on discovery, they are sending hidden company logos in the show."

Do you know about some other shaving videos? Preferably some good documentary about straights."
