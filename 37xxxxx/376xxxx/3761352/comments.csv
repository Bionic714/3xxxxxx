Here Are The Steps u gotta Follow...
1.As the Download completes u'll see a folder ""HYSYS v3.2""

2.There U'll find Setup.exe, Open it And Install Hysys..

3.After installation Click on finish..

4. Then Copy the Crack Contents as follows..

""1. Copy dll's(Both Isapiw32.dll and strgxi2.dll) to '\Program Files\Common Files\Hyprotech\Shared' folder
2. Copy lservrc to '\Program Files\Hyprotech\HYSYS 3.2' folder""

5.Then the Most Important part is to change ur system date to 2005..Otherwise The ""No Net"" error will appear.
And i knw its pretty old but its the only version available for pirates.. ;) "
