Aca les dejo la ultima version del Alcohol con el Key.
 
 
 
Alcohol 120%, is a powerful Windows application that makes it easy to create backups of DVDs and CDs. In addition, the program lets you store your most used CDs as images on your computer, so you can call them up at the click of a button. Home users make backup copies of their game CDs and movie DVDs, allowing the kids to treat multimedia disks roughly, without destroying their value. Librarians and school administrators use Alcohol 120% to archive their institutions' collections of recordable media, protecting themselves against the daily wear and tear that damages discs. Business users use Alcohol 120% to make duplicate backup copies of software titles, ensuring that they will continue to have access to their licensed software, even if their physical CDs become damaged and unusable. With Alcohol 120%, you no longer have to worry about CDs or DVDs getting lost, stolen, or damaged. Duplicate discs work just like the originals, and your entire collection can be archived safely.
