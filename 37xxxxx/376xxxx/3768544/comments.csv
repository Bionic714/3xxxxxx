,themanalaa,2007-08-11T00:37Z,"thanks for this...i just love Hayao Miyazaki films ,, but do you have ather subtiteles like swedish or arabic for this movie or other movies ,,, thanks again"
,Egal,2007-08-15T17:21Z,"Uhm... nope. This is a DVD release. Everything is either already in there, or not. I don't know if there is any way to add subtitles afterwards. Hope somebody else will be able to help you!"

,technimac,2007-11-15T01:32Z,"Thanks for this Miyazaki upload!
You can use ConvertXtoDVD to add subtitles to an AVI file (convert the the NRG to AVI first, I think), then add an SRT or SUB file to that.
It's worth a try if you can find the subs.
Good luck!"

thanks !"
,The_Flying_Welshman,2008-08-06T03:16Z,"Have you tried MagicISO? The program allows you the ability to convert formats to .iso, .uif, .nrg, bin... etc.  There's a torrent for it somewhere."

,mpilting,2009-12-07T23:44Z,"I'm not sure why, but my computer was unable to read the last three vob files. No one else seems to be having an issue though, so maybe my download got corrupt somehow."
,bakadesuka,2010-01-03T08:47Z,"Hey there, thx for the upload! I mounted the image with daemon and played it with media player classic, but can't seem to get the subtitles (English or Japanese) working. Anyone has the same problem? "
,Curtis99,2010-12-15T21:16Z,Can I burn this to a DVD-R and play it in a dvd player?
