,Rannek,2007-08-25T15:40Z,"Thats not an answer, (it doesnt realy matter if its a movie or serie)"
,melfice26,2007-08-26T12:29Z,"Well, if you would start by asking a proper question, you can expect a proper answer..."

,Redoctober59,2009-02-14T07:22Z,"Two things:

#1:Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you!!!!!!!

#2:Is this edited or uncut?"
,eruiluvatar,2009-04-20T19:49Z,"First off, I want to thank those individuals who upload the torrents. Great job and I appreciate your work. Now the rant:

Ok. Seriously. Since no one can fucking figure stuff out, I will explain everything.
Original Japanese DBZ - 291 episodes
Ocean Group English Dub cut first 67 japanese episodes into 53 English dub episodes.
Then Funimation continued on from where Ocean Group left off (epi 53) and continued until the end.
That is why the English dubs have 276 instead of the original 293.

IF A TORRENT SAYS 276 DBZ EPISODES THEN IT HAS THE CUT OCEAN GROUP DUBS IN IT.

Wow, that wasn't hard to figure out.
BUT, the rights owned by Ocean Group to the first 67 jap episodes expired and Funimation grabbed them.
Funimation has now remastered and redubbed all of the original 293 japanese episodes into english (uncut) and released them in boxed DVD sets. You can see them here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=dragon+ball+z&tag=funimation-20&index=dvd

THOSE are what I would really like to find, but unfortunately, all I have found so far is ocean group dubs and the funimation tv dubs. haven't found the uncut remastered english versions yet. "
,eruiluvatar,2009-04-20T19:50Z,"replase 293 with 291 above, my bad"
,majingoku,2009-06-25T09:57Z,whats with the anime HQ thing at the top
,ghostrider222,2011-05-18T09:38Z,"Please SEED!!
Down. speed 2.0KB/s"
,The.Real.Zer0,2011-10-10T12:43Z,"SHAME ON ALL OF YOU FOR NOT SEEDING!!!  This appears to be a GREAT upload but unfortunately I'll never know!  If the uploader, melfice26 if still around could I beg you to please seed a little?  I'll seed 10x if you would oblige!"
