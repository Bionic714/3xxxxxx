,magellan667,2007-08-13T07:23Z,The full X-plane version is about 7 DVDs... it might be faster to buy it rather than DLing...

,cicerosa,2008-02-28T19:57Z,"Hi people, first comment here and... And yes, waste your time installing this fake DVD to enjoy X-plane, it's easy, easy:

1) Just download demo version 8.64 (that's a full version too) and install it. 
2) Then launch dmg before X-plane, mantaining it opened, X-plane will recognize it as legal DVD. 

That's all folks."
