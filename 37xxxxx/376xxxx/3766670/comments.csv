,gators-fan,2007-08-09T15:00Z,"Thnx, troels999... got it. Bradfantin, you're confusing iLIFE 08 with iWORK 08, the latter of which requires a password (provided in these Comments). iLIFE 08 doesn't; just install and run. Once you enter the S/N, iWORK 08 works just fine. There is one little wrinkle with iWORK 08, however: to register it ---which isn't necessary--- you need to provide Apple with an ""Mxxxx-xxx"" sort of number, which is nominally found on the box. No biggie, since it doesn't interfere with the functionality of the program. Just chill, and, please, remember to seed after you d/l iLIFE 08."

Is there by chance anyone who can say if this just might work? is there anyone who knows anyone with a 1.67 Ghz G4 processor or equivalent powerbook that got this running?

Maybe because your ports arent open... I think because Azerues Uses Upnp to get around firewalls. But it will be alot faster with ports open. go to portforwad.com for the guides. I used to have windows so use a patch called tcip or something just google tcip patch.

,emacuser,2008-07-03T13:23Z,seed plz 1 person is seeding out of 103 connected and he is limited to 15 kb/s

,roketjack,2008-07-21T12:54Z,"Is this file like a CD rom or DVD, like an iso?"
,JPSSPJ,2008-08-03T16:18Z,"I'm currently leeching at 700kbps, so the problem must be your end."
,aflac1992,2008-08-06T03:31Z,"I'm getting 4kb/s and only 2 of 5 peers, am I doing something wrong?"
,ebeyer,2008-08-09T02:15Z,"Okay, so it downloaded and installed no problem, but when i launch imovie it just refuses to run it says it quit unexpectedly, and keeps happening. Im running a dual core intel mac with all my specs surpassing what i need.. running leopard.. something i can do? i have tried re-installing already"
,HattonMacn,2008-08-10T21:14Z,Very nice!!! Installed perfectly and works great. My computer crashed on me and I didn't have any Time Machine backups. This completed my list of applications that I had prior to crashing. Thanks! Only downfall is more people need to seed. I have a 6mb/sec dl speed and it took a week to complete! If you download anything then common courtesy is to seed afterwards. Thanks.
,select12,2008-08-10T22:13Z,"how do you seed?
"
,android987,2008-08-17T19:52Z,"this does not work properly. there are errors with imovie (does not open) and idvd (cant see any of the screen options, eg dvd main menu). i think it may be down to my mac running on leopard. "
,budask8,2008-08-23T03:10Z,"SEEEDDDD PLZZ!!! DOWNLOAD STOPED ON 87%, I ALREADY SEEDED 10GB!!!!"

,spary3001,2008-08-27T00:59Z,Come on people if your downloading please seed :-)
,SloYerRoll,2008-09-10T01:47Z,"17kb sec...

People, PLEASE LISTEN!!!

This isn't some magical portal where software just is delivered to your computer. It takes people to seed. 
So PLEASE seed files for AT LEAST as long as it took to download them. Stop being so damn greedy. It's not like your web connection is crippled because your seeding. It's barely even noticeable. "
,gags,2008-09-16T23:32Z,"hi,

,UmTH,2008-12-20T22:05Z,"after downlading and updating I launched iMovie and it tried to connect to ""private.no-ip.org"" UDP something - what's up with that??"
,tzongue,2008-12-28T11:51Z,I just installed this on my Hackintosh (iAtkos 10.5.5) & it appears to work perfectly.  No serial code was needed.  Thanks uploader!
,redcherry,2008-12-29T10:56Z,"Just want to say:THANK YOU!!!!!

Installed perfectly (no probs with iMovie which some others have reported).

This version of iMovie is crap, compared to the previous one, luckily though it didn't overwrite the old version I had - iMovie HD - so you can use whichever one you want.

No probs with the torrent though! xx"
,ajhp,2008-12-30T22:17Z,"if you have finished downloading, PLEASE keep seeding downloaded great till about 80% now 0-4 kbs. don't let this die!"

,VHALT,2009-01-11T03:53Z,"So why the hell did it get slower with the more seeds I connected to???  I reached like 600 kb/s when I first started downloading it, then it went all the way down to .3 kb/s and now it's ranging from 10 kb/s to 20 kb/s.  Very confusing.  "
,andy72184,2009-01-12T16:35Z,"Why are people getting this when 09 is out?  Well not here but its out on other torrent sites, this is taking forever to show up.  Hurry up!"
,Rob.Brooks,2009-01-15T01:54Z,"I downloaded this over the summer of 2008, and just wanted to thank 'bugsmenot'.  It did take a while, but it was well worth it.  Everything worked perfectly.  Thanks!"
,killerener999,2009-01-15T11:14Z,where is ilife 09?
,Troels999,2009-01-15T14:32Z,Could we get iLife '09?

,5uperdude111,2009-06-23T08:29Z,wtfomfgbbq! PLEASE SEEEEDD!!!!! stuck on 35.8%!!! only getting 0-20kb/s!!!!!!!!!!
,dlarrym,2009-08-05T20:00Z,"Well ""andy72184"" this is to your stupid comment... iLife09 will not run on OS 10.4.11 (Tiger) and not everyone has Leopard (OS 10.5) or the just released Snow Leopard (10.6) so that is the OBVIOUS reason.... If you don't want it, don't download it... It is very easy to understand...by by Why is everyone so angry with there comments..Like any negitive comment is really going to do anything to anyone..."
,xcoreychaoticx,2009-08-14T18:24Z,"Hey everyone, im trying to seed as fast as i can... its currently 215 kb/s but its been as fast as 545 kb/s yesterday. so go ahead and download. for all you powermac's imovie wont work but everything else will, no serial. I have a Powermac G4 Mirrored with 2GB Ram And Dual 867 Processors, and it works only with intel macs. but garageband, idvd, iphoto, etc WILL work on AMD's or anything else."
,GenoOrlando13,2010-04-29T04:04Z,"Will This Work On Mac os x Leopard 10.5.8?

And Btw Thanks For The Upload Download Speed Is Coming At 1012kb/s thanks keep seeding seeders"
,superbrady,2011-04-25T00:32Z,"@GenoOrlando13, yes it will. Thats what version of OS X I am currently using. iLife '08 is waayyyy faster than '09.  I like it better for my hackintosh, much like I like iWork '08 better than '09."
,candyb32,2011-08-30T01:06Z,"I thought I was downloading for the last 2-3 days, but my transmission window says: 3.8 GB, uploaded 5.06 GB (Ratio 1.33)
Then under the green bar it says Seeding to 3 of 4 peers - UL 27.6 KB/s
So what am I actually doing? I don't mind seeding, since people need seeding (I don't know what that is, but I can keep doing it) but I also want to download iLife08! Did I click the wrong button? Please help this non computer whiz..."
