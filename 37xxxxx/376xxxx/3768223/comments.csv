,kingten,2007-08-10T02:00Z,cheers man also uploaded london-brighton express for the train sim
,laurie0236,2007-08-10T19:39Z,"Thanks for the torrent. I am now stuck on 8.9% and no one seeding.
I thought this was going to be seeded for a month 24/7."
,kingten,2007-08-10T21:47Z,it is ive being seeding since i uploaded the torrent and i still am as i type this
,laurie0236,2007-08-10T23:50Z,"Hello Kington
With great respect I do not have any seeders on the download and considering that the torrent has been downloaded 28 times none of the 28 are seeding this torrent. Plenty of leechers, and all at just 8.8%. It has not moved from that % for the last 10 hours. I did download the Brighton torrent very quickly because there were lots of seeders, and I seeded it until my upload ratio reached nearly 3.00.

Regards
Laurie"
,kingten,2007-08-11T05:58Z,"hello laurie 
                    ive got my upload rate to the maximum settings on the bit torrent client at the moment it says
1. it was downloaded 30 times
2. there is one seeder which i presume its me
3. and there is nine leechers
and im up loaded to 13 peers as i write this 

so if im uploading to 13 peers where does the nine leechers come in to it?


and if it was downloaded 30 times shoudnt that be 30 seeders??????
"
,laurie0236,2007-08-11T12:15Z,"Hi kingten
The download is now working OK with just 1 seeding, which I presume is you plus 26 peers. There must have been a problem last night with utorrent that stopped me getting your site.

I find it hard to believe that 30 people downloaded the route and are very bad mannered not to stay and seed until they have uploaded as much as they have downloaded. Its a pity there is no way of preventing them using the completed torrent until they had uploaded what they downloaded.

Keep up the good work.

,blankbox,2007-08-11T18:55Z,...click your name...that'll show you the real numbers...Downloaded count here is FUBAR...think it's a new Swedish numbering system..hehe..
,icypixel,2007-08-13T13:56Z,"Hey, I too am having trouble with seeds. But I'f anyone wants L&SE give me a shout and I will upload..."
,laurie0236,2007-08-13T15:01Z,"icypixal

Thanks for the offer of L & SE. I already have it.
I am stuck at 37.7% and there are no seeders. Where are all the 32 who have downloaded the route.

,kingten,2007-08-13T16:25Z,as i said people im seeding 24hrs non-stop at max upload settings and i need help to seed it so call ln ur fellow pirate bay leechers to help u there
,icypixel,2007-08-13T18:59Z,"When I get this done, I will seed for a bit =]"
,icypixel,2007-08-13T19:13Z,"laurie0236

The downloaded counter is all the times people have clicked the link, not people who have got 100% of the file. Hope that clears a few things up =]"
,icypixel,2007-08-14T00:22Z,3 seeders yet I cant download?
,laurie0236,2007-08-14T11:15Z,"icypixal

,icypixel,2007-08-18T14:21Z,Is it just me or is the .rar corrupt?
