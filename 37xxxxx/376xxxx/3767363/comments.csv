,dim555,2008-03-31T21:42Z,"Thank you, Reg Code worked perfectly well for me."
,Tamarind777,2008-05-03T05:22Z,"I don't know if I did something wrong, but I installed the software and used it to clean the free space on my HD and it messed up my OS. I had to redo my entire HD. I used the feature that says, ""safe restart"" and I guess it wiped what it shouldn't have. Anyone knows why this happened? I really like the previous versions of this software and have good past experiences with them.

Thanks for any advice."
,marcusgc3,2008-09-14T05:17Z,"This Serial/Registration (""techboy"") worked great for me a couple months ago... 
Now Evidence Elimiator has gotten wise to this serial: Upon entering this User & Reg Key, it warns you abut piracy & even f*cking removes the 30-day trial, so the program cant even be used once. ):
I cant even use my Reg Key for EE v5.0. 
Even without an internet connection, as soon as you are connected it recognizes it as a bad serial & makes EE unusable.

Im gonna play with Resource Hacker and a Hex Editor to see if i can do something to stop this.

*Does ANYONE know of a working Registration Key or Patch/Crack for EE v6.01 (or even for EE v5.0)??? -Thanks"
,j3101s,2008-10-21T12:21Z,"This app corrupted my registry. I now have to do a complete reinstall. Please use caution. This is the first bad torrent I have downloaded from here. I always scan and rescan everything I DL. Am now wishing that I created a restore point before using this app.

To anyone considering this: Back up your system first. I am not accusing the uploader of any wrongdoing, just stating the facts..."
,oneballn,2009-01-28T04:19Z,Just as an update. As of Jan 2009 I used this program with included name and registration perfectly with no problems. I've used this before on different machines great program and never had registry issues. Maybe just scare tactics.
,Ouzotime,2009-02-26T04:27Z,eset smart security found trojan on this and deleted it i hope its just me ...and im not a spamer
,wushuq92,2009-03-25T03:05Z,How can i modify this to work on windows 7?
,Manhax,2009-04-11T17:30Z,"It's right what Ouzotime says. This shit is a big fucking trojan and the link given in the text file is just a ass raping link to the demo version, which is crap. This sucks."
,gr3g0s,2009-06-03T00:36Z,"um yes my Avira antivirus detects bifrose backdoor in these EE files, but the ""trojan"" is also in these files that i d/l directly of the EE site, so its as clean as possible i guess???"
,DarkStormz999,2009-06-30T20:21Z,"WHAT THE HELL. No one click that link that they say, ""Can also be downloaded here:""

I clicked it and the website said something about they logged my IP and it's under investigation?

Can someone please calm my fears and tell me it's a prank scare?"
,papparazi07,2011-10-02T20:55Z,its works on windows 7?
