,nikolaz,2008-06-23T20:35Z,"I am not sure, seeing how I just started downloading, but, just an idea, to those of you who are having the insert disc 1 problem, ummm, have you tried cracking the game?"
,nikolaz,2008-06-24T21:29Z,"Ok, I've downloaded the game, installed it, cracked it, and it works just fine for me. No problems at all, so again, a suggestion to those of you having the insert disc 1 problem, if you haven't put in the crack, then do so and see if that fixes the problem. If it doesn't, then I'm lost for what to do. I hope I was able to help someone here."
,Arandie,2008-06-26T20:04Z,"Also, most cracks are made to work with the 1.3 update and not 1.3.1 - make sure you did not accidentally update past what your fix will support. "
