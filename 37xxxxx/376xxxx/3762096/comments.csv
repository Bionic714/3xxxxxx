,vanglak,2009-07-13T16:57Z,"I do not recommend this movie. it works with real player but you have to really work HARD for the subtitles, which is ridiculous. RMVB format is good for anime, not real action- which is why this movie is such in a poor quality. 

There is no separated srt file, which is a bitch to do without. You said there's a seperate subtitles file. There is none. Most viewers do not have DirectVobSub, which usually you cannot assemble with another program except virtualDub. I do, and it is not even in the realplayer's menu to load subtitles like you mentioned. You make it sound like I have to install 3-4  programs for this one. VirtualDub, DirectVobSub, Realtime player, maybe a converter. Just.. No.

 I don't even have the file to start with to ""paste"" captions. ""Auto-loading version"" that name you just made up is simply DirectVobSub. I have the full version.  (i have ffshow, vsfilter, etc... so I was expecting this movie to be enjoyable. rmvb requires a new converter to any file format. not only that, srt file will be missing.

I think you ought to take this down because you're just wasting people's time. Just my honest opinion. "
