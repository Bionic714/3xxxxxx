Overview:	Scientists' experiments on the Power Glove are on the verge of success. The Power Glove is designed to activate the unknown powers of the human brain to unlock the full potential of the human body. Special Agents Dark, Thunder, and War 21 (Fight 21) are the only survivors of the experiment. Ambitious War 21 turns to the dark side when he kidnaps Thunder with a Power Glove and disappears. Dark searches for him for 20 years. When Thunder returns two decades later, he has a very brainwashed Thunder, and an underground army, in tow. Their goal is nothing less than world domination. While Dark is continually unable to eliminate them all, he realizes that a potential ally may await him in Thunder's son, whose similar DNA may be the key to unlocking his powers and using them to fight for justice.
