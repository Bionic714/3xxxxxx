,skweeble,2007-08-05T17:58Z,"Can someone comment on Quality?? Is the sound better on this one then the other LTT version, where the first 3rd is crap??"
,starscream_88,2007-08-06T03:27Z,"Yer, can anyone say whether the sound on this is better than the other copy?"
,starscream_88,2007-08-06T21:07Z,"*sigh* It's the same damn copy, why can'y anyone have the decency to upload a copy with half decent sound THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE FUCKING MOVIE!? I've wasted too many DVDs finding out if different copies will play the 1st 30 mins of sound... and they've all been the same. Wank."
,Spegma,2007-08-13T23:49Z,"Yeah, can anyone have the decency to stop bitching about what is given to them?  Seriously though, if you honestly think you can do a better job, then do it.  Otherwise take what you can and shut the fuck up, or get the fuck out!!!!  Thanks Ltt_Fr1 for your efforts on this upload."
,midnightextreme,2007-08-24T05:05Z,"good upload,thanks"
,ginormus,2007-08-26T20:47Z,"i'm sick of people bitching about people bitching about the quality of a download. Yes, it's free, but so many people *LIE* about the quality of a torrent that these questions need to be asked, and people need to be told when an uploader is talking shit. So can it. If the quality is crap, I want to know so i canmake a descision on wether or not to download."
