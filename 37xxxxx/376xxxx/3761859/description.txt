Image Eye is a quite specialized image viewer - specialized i.e. for the sole purpose of viewing images as quickly and as practically as possible - and nothing else! You don't get any menus, tool bars or other fancy - but sometimes very anoying - things cluttering up the window where you want to see a picture an nothing else! In fact, if you want you can even have the window title bar dissapear when you don't need it, leaving just the image itself! And there are many handy and practical user interface 'tricks'; e.g. hitting Ctrl-Alt-X to close all image windows - just to mention one!
