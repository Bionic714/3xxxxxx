,captainkhaos1,2007-08-08T20:20Z,If anyone has earlier sets please share. I have some and some of those are not complete. I will try to post some of those asap
,captainkhaos1,2007-08-08T21:17Z,I also have Virginia sets 16-42 posted but it doesn't show on the main page. If you will type in Virginia in the pirate search and click the other box it will take you to where it is. Don't know why it didn't show on the main page 
,captainkhaos1,2007-08-08T21:53Z,"ok, just wondering what I did to it. Trying to post some more stuff but it keeps telling me wrong code.  Maybe I will figure this out one of these years."
,Salty2,2007-08-08T22:17Z,Thanks for filling in those blank spots my friend...Salty
,captainkhaos1,2007-08-08T22:19Z,your welcome salty. If I can figure out how to upload and seed better I will post more. I get lucky sometimes and it works but most of the time it won't upload. I don't want you all to think I am just a leecher. Have alot of stuff I can post if I can figure it out
,leetsomfer,2007-08-10T17:35Z,Stuck at 79%. If anyone has 100% please seed so that others can help.  Currently I am seeding all that I have.
,LittleCentaurette,2007-08-12T00:01Z,Stuck at 78.9% for 2 days now ... Seeder anywhere PLZ ?
,leetsomfer,2007-08-12T21:35Z,"It looks like captainkaos1 is the only one with 100%, and apparently does not wish to seed long enough for others to reach that mark.  As I indicated previously, I can only seed what I have which is not very helpful considering I do not have the full download.  This looks to be a waste of time for everyone if nobody is ever going to get this full download."
,SweetRikku,2007-08-14T13:17Z,"Hey captainkhaos1, do you even care to SEED? Come on man! You UP it , you SEED it ! We can't do it without YOU !!!"
,SweetRikku,2007-08-14T13:18Z,That download 203 times is BS ... NO ONE has 100% but captainkaos1 (as of this comment)
,vyse_sky_pirate,2007-08-15T18:15Z,5 days and still no extra seeders?  It is only 185 MB.  Sheesh.
,SweetRikku,2007-08-17T02:25Z,captainkhaos1 is sewing Chaos instead of seeding ... come on man!!!!!!!
