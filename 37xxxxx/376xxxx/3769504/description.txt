CHERRY POPTART STORY BY NEIL GAIMAN!

The main character Cherry Poptart, is a young woman who is described by the comic's publishers as "blonde, cute, sexy, fun, friendly & smart." Her character is bisexual and eternally horny, as are most females who appear in the comic. 

First published in 1982, the comic series was originally called Cherry Poptart, but was changed to simply Cherry as of 1986 and through every following issue. This was done in order to avoid a lawsuit from Kellogg's over the Pop-Tarts trademark.

The publisher of the comic is Last Gasp and later Cherry Comics. Though the comic is largely known as an erotic or pornographic book, it does garner critical merit for occasional political commentary. The Cherry character has also appeared in several free speech/censorship awareness campaigns.

Welz draws the comic in a simple style reminiscent of the Archie comic book series, though he does experiment with different drawing styles, including a 3D edition.
