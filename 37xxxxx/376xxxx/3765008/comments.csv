They are not the dvd rips but some rip off trailer or something. You are saked to download the 3W palyer from a site called iwant.play3w.com if you download this free media player you also download Malware with it too these are some real fucko bad viruses and once in your pc it is hard to get rid of it. Dont Take The Chance!!!

,davi367,2007-08-07T23:41Z,this feckin file asks you to download a certain 3w media player which contains a virus. what idont understand is why do people continue to seed it and is there no moderators to remove these files as it gives the site a bad reputation. davi367
