This Torrent contains everything you need to have to be able to play on the FWOW server
as well as other private servers.


Alot of things have happen since last, we\'ve changed name to Fourworlds, Burning Crusade have been released, 
and the private servers has been revamped and more up to date since before. 
This is the continuing of one of the most succesfull servers of 2005!
Want to join the adventure?

Connecting to a private server
1. Right click the WoW.exe file in your WoW folder and check what version you got, you got to have the 2.1.3 version.
2. In your WoW folder you should have a file called \"realmlist.wtf\" open it with notepad and delete everything in it and
type \"set realmlist fourworlds.zapto.org \"(without the \") 
3. Now you need an account. Create an account at this site: http://fourworlds.zapto.org/index.php
4.Now your ready to play on the Server. Start WoW and put in your acc and pass in the fields and log in. 

Do not start WoW with the Launcher, Start through WoW.exe the reason to do so is that the realmlist.wtf will change back and
you can\'t connect and you must edit it again.
