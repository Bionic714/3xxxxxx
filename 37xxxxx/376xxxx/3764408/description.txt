Stan Deyo ( http://www.standeyo.com/ ) has held Above Top Secret Security Clearance and worked undercover for the FBI. He was part of an exclusive "black 

project", headed by Dr. Edward Teller specializing in the development of "flying saucer technology". Stan trained in computer programming at IBM. Stan's main 

love is still advanced propulsion and "free" energy research which took him to Australia in '71 to work on these systems. Currently Stan is working on a 

Tesla-based energy system, several propulsion projects and is a public lecturer on world events, including: 

-The coming global economic collapse 
-Developing solar-related crises in the Earth's climate 
-The "UFO Deception and its real intent / Suppression of badly needed technologies 
-The coming destruction of America by civil war followed by foreign invasion 
-High voltage physics of cheaper energy 
-The New World Order from the perspective of a former FBI 'spy."

Included in this discussion from 2005 is the history of alternative energy breathroughs, Edward Teller's covert technological development program, the 

mathematical equations used in the advanced physics as well as in-depth information and slides demonstrating 'anti-gravity', the effort used in the 50s to 

try to get scientists to think outside the box, as well as the multinationalist's "N.W.O." agenda utilizing "U.F.O." technology and their reasons for doing 

so.
