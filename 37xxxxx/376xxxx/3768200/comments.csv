,jumajuma,2010-03-07T07:41Z,can you please tell me how to use the corrected english subtitles with this movie. thanks. great print but can't understand how to activate the subtitles that came as separate download here.
,jumajuma,2010-03-07T13:10Z,"ok, the answer to my question is you must install the plugin VobSub (a free download) and then be sure that the .srt file has exactly the same file name as the .avi video file name apart from the file extensions, and that both files are in the same directory folder. then subtitles will automatically play when you open the video file in windows media and other apps"
