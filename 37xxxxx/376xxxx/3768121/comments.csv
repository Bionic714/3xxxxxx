For regenerating bad sectors, Saving disc, Saving data, Viruses and lots of stuff but you need to know to operate with this program (this is a collection of more boot programs) if you don't better do nothing.

Note: Burn image on CD, insert CD on startup (make sure that it in BIOS is set up to look CD before HDD) and than you use tools i sad about..."
