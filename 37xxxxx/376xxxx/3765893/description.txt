     A bickering young couple must join as one to escape from a deranged maniac 
with twisted intentions after checking into a motel of snuffer. It has been a 
long day for Amy and David Fox. Amid the usual arguments and bust ups, the 
couple are horrified when their car suddenly plunges out of form leaving them 
stranded on a lonely highway. However things are about to get a whole lot worse 
for the pair, and soon they are about to become the main attraction in their own 
fates as victims of a twisted plot which sees them pit against a jittery camera 
left to record their every move as they are chased through the darkened hallways 
of a creepy motel. You can check in, but you can't check out!!!
