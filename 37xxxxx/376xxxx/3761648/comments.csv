,GareyP,2008-03-04T02:08Z,"I agree don't rar and we can pick individual files not everything. if there is a mistake with the one rar file then everything is lost, but jpg files if you loose 10 out of 100 you still have 90 good files. RAR files suck"
,miek334,2008-04-08T16:14Z,"grr.. I hate it. How am i supposed to know what im downloading?? how do i filter out the stuff i dont want? quick preview?

Thanks for the rar... i think i'll pass."
,mad_swan,2008-04-15T15:37Z,"I think it is not much trouble the rars. You can add to them a recovery registry so it can be repaired. Anyway, I agree it is not much useful all in ony one rar."
