In this first episode of the series, Peter goes out to a friend's bachelor party, but first promises Lois that he won't get drunk. He does, of course, and the resulting hangover causes him to lose his job the next day. After several unsuccessful attempts to get a new job, Peter applies for welfare, only to discover that a clerical error has now made the family rich. Things spin further out of Peter's control, while Lois is still unaware that her husband has been fired.
