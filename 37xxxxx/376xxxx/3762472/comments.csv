Dave House and Boom in the Diamond Industry."
,bluegamba,2007-08-04T19:00Z,"Thanx again Shankly. Good to have you back. Might I suggest a couple of Bluegamba's Choices? Just click my name. I think they make a nice complement to your excellent Children of Love.
Best Regards."

Keep the recommendations coming!"

Hope you've had a nice vacation. As usual the mix looks really nice, a really good way to find new music.

Noticed that you missed out on testa rosa's self titled debut. I'd reccomend that you give them a listen!

,ralasdair,2007-08-06T20:25Z,"Nice work as usual Shankly!

Any chance you could add some id3 tagging that makes it easy to group your stuff in iTunes?

'Shankly's Best of [month] [year]' in the 'Grouping' field, maybe?"
