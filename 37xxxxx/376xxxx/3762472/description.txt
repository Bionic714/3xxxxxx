Only got back a few days ago to sort out Shankly's Best from July but found enough for three cracking CDs worth of stuff. Highlights include breaking bands, Lodger, Sleeping States, Get Him Eat HIm and Brinkman; old favourites, Gary Numan, the Fiery Furnaces, Super Furry Animals and the Happy Mondays; new remixes of Bloc Party (again) and BRMC; and live tracks from Emma Pollock, Low and a couple from Glastonbury - not to mention a 15 minute track from Gorky's man Euros Childs. All in all, it should keep you busy through August. TGIS.
