Just delete 'Est.-.dvd-ed2k_' from any vob files to strip.

Only 18mb missing from main movie, overall in 5 places. You won't notice any difference."

Uncompressed =

DVD Fab to strip extras & alternate ending.

DVD Shrink to replace all foreign menu's with 'still picture' (Black Wallpaper)

Full quality achieved!"
