,Ace Busby,2007-08-06T01:45Z,those pics don't look so hot.
,saveO,2007-08-06T06:59Z,"Well, just try it out for a day/night cycle in different areas, many people have been surprised of the atmosphere it brings, after all this mod is only shooting for atmosphere in gameplay, not vibrant environments.

If you just are going to say that it's bad then either you can stay away from that commentbutton or at least give some feedback why you think its bad."
