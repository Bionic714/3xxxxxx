Okay kiddies, this here is the oft-mentioned but rarely heard first draft of Brad Neely's Wizard People: Dear Readers. Wizard People, for those unfortunate enough not to have heard of it, is a re-dubbing of the first Harry Potter movie as we all wish it would have been. If you've seen this before, it was most likely the revised version. You can download it for free from Illegal Art at:

The version I've posted is no longer available anywhere I've seen in several years. Most people who've heard the two, consider this version to be the best, as the timing of the jokes is more spot on, and the numerous screw-ups Neely makes in the reading add to the humor. If you're not sure which version you've heard, I'll make it easy. If Neely starts laughing in the middle of the sorting hat scene, you've got the first draft.

This is an Xvid rip of the DVD which I've added the Wizard People audio on a separate AC3 channel. And I must surely be a Badass New God with the way I've masterfully wielded my media editor to bring you absolutely perfect synchronization. You are not likely to ever get it synched better than this.

With that said, enjoy!
