[T],kirklestat,2007-12-19T02:36Z,"this has a very good audio and video quality for a 700mb two-hour movie. i have been looking for a 1-cd rip of this movie and all i can find is the 2-cd rip by a well-known scene group. i'm wondering why you're rips does not have many seeders and considering that the quality is very good.

zookeeper525, you are a very good ripper, you need a group to make seeding faster, but that does not mean you do it. i'm just giving you an idea as i consider you a very good ripper. thanks for this but i'm still leeching at 78%."
