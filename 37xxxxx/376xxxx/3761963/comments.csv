I can't wait to try it out. And will our drivers for 10.4 x86 work on leopard????????"
,riws,2007-08-04T10:18Z,The patched DVD wont install a working osx
,ticklemonster,2007-08-04T13:56Z,r u retarded...it works...if you need help go to osx86scene.com
,riws,2007-08-04T14:29Z,"ticklemonster, are some idiot??? Can't read???
He said it does not work (after install). And so it is.
9a499 is more limited ( incompatible ), then 9a466.
And the Kernel for 9a499 is a shitty one, no 64bit

OM617
Replace Kernel and Kext on osx from the patch. (repari perm.)"
,ticklemonster,2007-08-04T14:44Z,"I can't read???
""IT DOES NOT WORK'' 
that's all he said

but it works fine on 9a466

and you apparently can't write

""are some idiot???"""
,riws,2007-08-04T15:04Z,9a466 is for noobs like you
,antamony,2007-08-04T16:12Z,"""The patched DVD wont install a working osx""
""9a466 is for noobs like you""


Uh-huh - I think we all know who the n00bs are - the whinies who claim the DVD ""won't install""(waaaaa-waaa mommy!)

,ticklemonster,2007-08-04T17:47Z,well said anatomy
,riws,2007-08-04T18:21Z,"antamony, read again ""The patched DVD wont install a working osx"", so what it says?"
,ticklemonster,2007-08-04T19:09Z,"yes it does can you not understand English..is it that hard..this patch allows you to run leopard on your PC but you need Tiger already installed...ok

go download something you know how to use

""so what it says?""
and where r u from anyway"
,Maxxuss1,2007-08-04T19:10Z,"LOL What you people dont realize, is if you are getting it to install... IT IS WORKING.  When you patch the DVD, it uncompresses a UNMODIFIED installation to your hard disk.  You then have to patch what was installed.  Which usually means coping over a new kernel and kexts, and repairing their permissions.  I downloaded this and have gotten both 9a499 and 9a466 working.  But if you can make the DVD get to the installer, you're half way there!  Now you just have to fix what was installed."
,ticklemonster,2007-08-04T19:15Z,well said maxxuss1: who do u think might have uploaded this file ;D
,riws,2007-08-04T19:19Z,"ticklemonster, so it installs a working Leo?
No it does NOT like Maxxuss1 said.
You have to patch the installed Leo.

,ticklemonster,2007-08-04T20:31Z,"Ur a fuckin retard

,ticklemonster,2007-08-04T20:32Z,did u get someone to proof your english this time or wat??
,riws,2007-08-04T20:39Z,"ticklemonster, retarded? Who has 9a499 up and running? I know that's NOT YOU. You can't even patch the damn DVD image."
,antamony,2007-08-04T22:09Z,"@ ""riws""

We have been having so much fun with you, that we ran out of spoons.

Please come back when we get more spoons. It will make feeding you soooooo much easier.

Either that, or POLITELY ask if there are forums where you could post a request for installation help. 

Have a nice day!"
,ticklemonster,2007-08-04T22:13Z,"i have patched it now im burning it on my ipod to boot with

,riws,2007-08-04T22:30Z,I have 9a499 running for ~2 weeks now on my pc. So I guess I don't need help with it. And  osx86scene.com? Full of noobs.
,ticklemonster,2007-08-04T22:34Z,"of course that's why you said this patch didn't work

,Maxxuss1,2007-08-05T03:52Z,it's funny listening to guys say it doesn't work.  Do you think that it might be that it does work... but you just don't know HOW to make it work?  Just a thought...
,riws,2007-08-05T09:08Z,"antamony, world isn't the same for everyone"
,ticklemonster,2007-08-05T14:26Z,"rlws shutup enough...this patch does work but its not easy to get it working PERIOD..if you think you are inteligent enough to use it download it...it definitely work...iv seen about 10 people who have gotten this to work.
