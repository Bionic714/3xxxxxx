I'm going to load and watch it, but thank God the internet allows people to see the direct relationship between solar activity and so-called global warming.

The graphs of solar activity and global temperatures match almost perfectly. Go ahead, research it! You will probably be shocked. Got balls? Then DO IT!"
,mike123,2007-08-14T12:11Z,"But you make one very flawed assumption. You assume that the majority of scientists subscribe to the Global Warming malarky.

Such an assumption is utterly absurd. In fact, scientists wishing to have their names removed from UN documents which claim they support the GW theories have even threatened legal action against the UN for having misused their names!

In fact many scientists are finally realizing the UN cannot be trusted (and is full of shit)."
,atom224,2007-08-20T22:51Z,"even if you don't believe in global warming, why would you want to be dependent on people that hate us?  jeez,  talk about stupid.  Or why would you want your constitution shredded along with your civil liberties.  If our resources were spent on domestic security, and not a war for oil (I mean liberation) - we would never have been in this situation.  Everyday life is starting to suck for a lot of people and all I hear are people that are too damn dumb to realize what is going on."
,oldngrey,2007-10-17T21:15Z,"The Big Myth! Global warming.
The film ""An Incovenient Truth"" would make a great presentation if it would tell you the truth about global warming , it's quick flashing scenes and ill begotten music gave me a sense of forbodding and doesn't not help to convey a sense of workable energy alternatives, this film made me feel helpless and depressed. Much of the film is with Al Gore without anyone really backing up his views , it is like a big ego trip.My conclusion is if you want a pure disaster horror film then this is the one for you, but if you want a unbiased view of global temperature change then look to the bbc horizion documentary about global climate change. the nobel prize has lost all of its meaning and prestige since Al Gore got his. If anyone believes that humans causes global warming is either ignorant or having an agenda. Al Gore does have an agenda, look at his new company which buys and sells carbon credits, instant money for nothing.The ""Greener"" religion just doesn't standup to Scientific facts. Al Gore would sell his mother for a little feel good publicity. Alfred Nobel is probably rolling in his grave over what the Nobel prize become. The Nobel Peace Prize had lost it prestige long ago when it was given to Arafat, the father of modern terrorism.

The nine alleged errors in the film
# Mr Gore claims that a sea-level rise of up to 20 feet would be caused by melting of either West Antarctica or Greenland ""in the near future"". The judge said: ""This is distinctly alarmist and part of Mr Gore's ""wake-up call"". He agreed that if Greenland melted it would release this amount of water - ""but only after, and over, millennia"".""The Armageddon scenario he predicts, insofar as it suggests that sea level rises of seven metres might occur in the immediate future, is not in line with the scientific consensus.""

# The film claims that low-lying inhabited Pacific atolls ""are being inundated because of anthropogenic global warming"" but the judge ruled there was no evidence of any evacuation having yet happened.

# The documentary speaks of global warming ""shutting down the Ocean Conveyor"" - the process by which the Gulf Stream is carried over the North Atlantic to western Europe. Citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the judge said that it was ""very unlikely"" that the Ocean Conveyor, also known as the Meridional Overturning Circulation, would shut down in the future, though it might slow down.

# Mr Gore claims that two graphs, one plotting a rise in C02 and the other the rise in temperature over a period of 650,000 years, showed ""an exact fit"". The judge said that, although there was general scientific agreement that there was a connection, ""the two graphs do not establish what Mr Gore asserts"".

# Mr Gore says the disappearance of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro was directly attributable to global warming, but the judge ruled that it scientists have not established that the recession of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro is primarily attributable to human-induced climate change.

# The film contends that the drying up of Lake Chad is a prime example of a catastrophic result of global warming but the judge said there was insufficient evidence, and that ""it is apparently considered to be far more likely to result from other factors, such as population increase and over-grazing, and regional climate variability.""

# Mr Gore blames Hurricane Katrina and the consequent devastation in New Orleans on global warming, but the judge ruled there was ""insufficient evidence to show that"".

# Mr Gore cites a scientific study that shows, for the first time, that polar bears were being found after drowning from ""swimming long distances - up to 60 miles - to find the ice"" The judge said: ""The only scientific study that either side before me can find is one which indicates that four polar bears have recently been found drowned because of a storm.""That was not to say there might not in future be drowning-related deaths of bears if the trend of regression of pack ice continued - ""but it plainly does not su"

Weather Channel Founder: Global Warming 'Greatest Scam in History' 
Intro by Joe D'Aleo, Icecap, CCM 
I was privileged to work with John Coleman, the founder of The Weather Channel in the year before it became a reality and then for the first of the 6 years I was fortunate to be the Director of Meteorology. No one worked harder than John to make The Weather Channel a reality and to make sure the staffing, the information and technology was the very best possible at that time.  John currently works with KUSI in San Diego. He posts regularly. I am very pleased to present his latest insightful post. 
By John Coleman 
It is the greatest scam in history. I am amazed, appalled and highly offended by it. Global Warming; It is a SCAM. Some dastardly scientists with environmental and political motives manipulated long term scientific data to create an allusion of rapid global warming. Other scientists of the same environmental whacko type jumped into the circle to support and broaden the ""research"" to further enhance the totally slanted, bogus global warming claims. Their friends in government steered huge research grants their way to keep the movement going. Soon they claimed to be a consensus. 
Environmental extremists, notable politicians among them, then teamed up with movie, media and other liberal, environmentalist journalists to create this wild ""scientific"" scenario of the civilization threatening environmental consequences from Global Warming unless we adhere to their radical agenda. Now their ridiculous manipulated science has been accepted as fact and become a cornerstone issue for CNN, CBS, NBC, the Democratic Political Party, the Governor of California, school teachers and, in many cases, well informed but very gullible environmentally conscientious citizens. Only one reporter at ABC has been allowed to counter the Global Warming frenzy with one 15 minute documentary segment. 
I do not oppose environmentalism. I do not oppose the political positions of either party. However, Global Warming, i.e. Climate Change, is not about environmentalism or politics. It is not a religion. It is not something you ""believe in."" It is science; the science of meteorology. This is my field of life-long expertise. And I am telling you Global Warming is a non-event, a manufactured crisis and a total scam. I say this knowing you probably won't believe a me, a mere TV weatherman, challenging a Nobel Prize, Academy Award and Emmy Award winning former Vice President of United States. So be it. 
I have read dozens of scientific papers. I have talked with numerous scientists. I have studied. I have thought about it. I know I am correct. There is no run away climate change. The impact of humans on climate is not catastrophic. Our planet is not in peril. I am incensed by the incredible media glamour, the politically correct silliness and rude dismissal of counter arguments by the high priest of Global Warming. 
In time, a decade or two, the outrageous scam will be obvious. As the temperature rises, polar ice cap melting, coastal flooding and super storm pattern all fail to occur as predicted everyone will come to realize we have been duped. The sky is not falling. And, natural cycles and drifts in climate are as much if not more responsible for any climate changes underway. I strongly believe that the next twenty years are equally as likely to see a cooling trend as they are to see a warming trend.  See John's full blog story here. "

,spacey1,2008-03-24T07:16Z,"the gist is that even if global warming isn't valid, then ""climate change"" is!  look at europe's weather last year - wet where usually dry, and dry where usually wet.  ice storm in N. america that took out electricity for hundreds of thousands for weeks just 3 months ago, and the eye of a hurricane that passed through oklahoma, usa. 

it's pollution and the use of oil that's causing all of this.  the right wingers and oil companies will deny this despite any evidence."

,koskovs,2010-01-19T01:24Z,"Fun thing this comments are written 2 years ago. I agree with Mike123 :)

Global warming is bogus, just an excuse for more tax on the people and more power to the government to ""deal"" with the problem, but things ARE indeed changing. 

Peak oil is real, after 2000 hours of research i am convinced this will be a major task and most likely people will die, but it will also bring us together as never before. 

Money is paper and everybody ever said ""save money in the bank and they will multiply was WRONG!"" Honest money = GOLD and things will change because it will remove power from those who do not deserve it. Government collect tax and distribute around, people have less and less control of the spending. Gold will stop the printing press to central banks and exponential growth built upon nothing in the financial world will collapse (and it should)

Richard Heinberg is a good speaker on the peak oil issue, but Alex Jones says there's evidence of an artificial scarcity being produced. Even if there is some of that going on there's still a finite quantity of good quality oil in my opinion."

This is a big story. It's an attempt by the Illuminati, working through their number one propaganda production factory, the Tavistock Institute in the City of London, to create the illusion that the world is rapidly running out of oil and within a few short years, we will experience unemployemnt, wars, famine, and all manner of horrendous strife as a result of the fallout from the now ""rapdily vanishing"" oil supplies. It's a scam from top to bottom. If you've noticed that gasoline prices are beginning to rise at gas pumps across America, you can thank this deception for that jump in gas prices and you can also expect those gasoline prices to continue to rise over time and possibly remain at unprecedented high levels from here on out, UNLESS enough Americans wake up to this deceit and demand an end to it.

There are large numbers of people out there trying to promote this scam through books, articles, lectures, films, television and talk radio. In America, Michael Ruppert of From the Wilderness is apparently the lead disinformation meister of this flimflam. Amy Goodman of Democracy Now is a Ford Foundation & Rockefeller Foundation funded Left Gatekeeper who, with her brother, have joined with Ruppert to not only promote the Peak Oil scam, but is a regular propagandist for the Global Warming hoax fronted by Illuminatus Al Gore.

KPFK radio, a 100,000 kilowatt FM radio station out of Los Angeles, is one of the five national radio outlets owned by the Pacifica Foundation and has been unrelentingly hammering out the Peak Oil and Global Warming propagnada mantras since Ruppert kicked off this Tavistock-hatched disinformation campaing in 2004.

The only two people, that I am aware of, with any sizeable readership who have been trying to expose these outrageous lies and monstrous distortions of the facts are Dave McGowan through his newsletters and Joe Vialls in articles published at this web site. I'll use this page to post articles from writers and researchers who are trying to expose this pretense, starting with Dave McGowan and Joe Vialls. (Update: Jan 21, 2004. Found a good article exposing Ruppert from Patrick Mooney of www.unlearning.org).
