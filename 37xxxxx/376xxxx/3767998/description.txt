     Orchestral instruments come alive with rich ambient piano and
     stereo sampled string sounds in the new Edirol HQ-OR Software
     Synthesizer. The premium sounds in this synth are perfectly
     combined for lush soundtracks and beautiful classical
     arrangements. And its multiple output compatible with DXi 2.0
     and VST 2.0 means you can enjoy your arrangements through
     several audio devices...simultaneously!

     The Orchestral Plug-In Software Synthesizer Orchestral provides

     spiccato, pizzicato, and tremolo. Using ample wave memory,
     Strings/Brass winds tones are selectable from solo, part section,
     and full section, making this ideal for the composition of
     contemporary music, sound tracks, and marching bands. The premium
     sounds in this synthesizer are perfectly combined for lush
