Plot: You've visited lands where a Cyclops roams ('The 7th Voyage of Sinbad'), skeletons duel ('Jason and the Argonauts') and cowboys lasso dinosaurs ('The Valley of Gwangi'). They are the worlds of Ray Harryhausen, the stop motion effects master who creates another dazzling realm in 'Clash of the Titans'.

Olympian gods, mythological monsters and heroic mortals populate this imaginative spectacle. Harry Hamlin is Perseus, mortal son of Zeus (Laurence Olivier) and champion of captive Andromeda (Judi Bowker). From that storyline, Harryhausen unleashes sea creature Kraken, snake haired Medusa, swamp denizen Calibos, flying horse Pegasus, two headed dog Dioskilos, giant scorpions and all manner of eye popping adventure. Let the clash begin!
