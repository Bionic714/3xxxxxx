Episode 5
Liquid Courage

It?s Homecoming Weekend, and Casey?s excited. Evan?s parents are visiting and she is determined to wow them. But, sadly, her expectations far outweigh the outcome. Evan?s parents can barely hide their boredom when they meet Casey over lunch. The only time they perk up is when Rebecca shows up uninvited?they are very impressed with the senator?s daughter! So impressed in fact, they take back an invitation to Casey to join them at a VIP dinner. The lucky winner of Casey?s invite? Why Rebecca, of course.

Rusty is having better luck?sort of. In honor of homecoming, Kappa Tau is throwing its biggest bash of the year, the Mt. Vesuvius Party, complete with exploding volcano. When a test run of the volcano shows it?s a dud, Rusty offers to fix it?but he can?t.

Desperate, he decides to steal the university?s Atmospheric Destabalizer Module?an armament relic from the 1980s that?s never been fired and is slated to be destroyed. His partners in crime? Zeta Beta Zeta?s Jen Z. and a very reluctant Dale.

Casey decides to crash the VIP dinner and show Evan?s parents what she?s made of. They are less than impressed.

Back at Kappa Tau, Rusty and Dale hook up the Module and the result is even better than Rusty hoped for. The volcano explodes, beer rains down, and Jen Z. tells Rusty she likes him. By the end of Homecoming Weekend, both sister and brother have had their worlds rocked?one by good, one by bad.
