,stupidreg1s73r,2008-05-04T10:08Z,"I now have 87.4% of the file without ever having a ""seed"" show up. Various peers have come along with ""pieces"" I don't have yet. Even if they only had 10% of the file they still had something I didn't. If this keeps up, I may have 100% someday, then everyone will be able to download from a full seed. 

If anyone can help get me the rest it would be appreciated. Then I can figure out how to convert realmedia to a useful file and finally find out just what the heck this will be in the first place."
,stupidreg1s73r,2008-05-20T18:28Z,"Ok, I?m getting desperate. It takes several weeks to get to 88% before a seed finally shows up. I cheer a scream. Then, for some reason, the seed leaves when I get to 94.7%. Now a bunch of peers show up and get that 94.7 in a matter of hours. I have a 4.1 ratio people! Appreciate the ?work? I have done to get that for you. I know you?re out there seed, I?ll be begging for your return until one day, yes one day, I will be the mighty seed! Then I will leave promptly (just kidding)."
