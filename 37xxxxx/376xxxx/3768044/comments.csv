Is there a Mac installer too?"

,bardtdz,2008-10-19T08:41Z,"There can I get the installer or something like this for my Mac? It might be for PC and Mac too, but in the torrent there are just .exe files. Sorry for my english)"
,kfgvdrse,2008-10-22T17:50Z,"I followed the instructions and this dl worked great.  And what a sound!  A very satisfying grand piano sound.  Note, though, that you're going to need lots of memory in your PC to take advantage of the fancier samples (at least 1 Gig)."
