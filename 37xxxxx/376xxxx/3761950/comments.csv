Upon restart I get a blue screen telling me that there was an error and that to save my computer it is performing a cache dump. I would strongly recommend NOT downloading. I have some choice words but I will save them until further analysis."

Windows Vista does not support DAEMON Tools 3.47 and 4.0

This version of DAEMON Tools 3.47 and 4.0 is not compatible with Windows Vista.

Recommendation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Microsoft recommends that you do not use DAEMON Tools 3.47 and 4.0 with Windows Vista at this time and that you remove DAEMON Tools 3.47 and 4.0. If this is not possible, please contact DAEMON Tools for support information for running DAEMON Tools 3.47 and 4.0 on Windows Vista.

,sk8puss,2007-09-05T02:58Z,"RE: Blue Screen Error: Ya, been there. Do you have RealPlayer? And/or ""Adaptec ASPI"" driver(s)? There's a conflict with that and XP, and is easily triggered with Alcohol/Daemon Tools/Nero ImageDrive. Search for ""aspi32.sys"". If you have it, Adaptec has a fix at their Web-site. Or, remove/disable the ASPI driver (uninstall RealPlayer, re-install, but DON'T take the driver update, eg.) Mine is okay now. Don't know if the issue is the same for Vista.
Hope it helps ^_^"
