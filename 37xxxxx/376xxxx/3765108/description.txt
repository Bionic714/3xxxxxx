This is a Danish subtitle to the movie The Simpsons Movie.

This is not the movie. That you will have to
download beside.

The way you get the subtitle on the movie is to use 
the program GOM Player ore VLC. If you use GOM player 
all you have to do is to take the file and track it on 
to the screen where the movie is playing. If you use
VLC you shall mount the file when you open the movie.

This subtitle dont fit on every The Simpsons Movie movie, but
it fits to The.Simpsons.Movie.PROPER.TELESYNC.XViD-PUKKA 

If there is a movie that you want danish subtitles 
to just ask and i will see if i can make them.
