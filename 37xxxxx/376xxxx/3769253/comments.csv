,DizConnected,2007-08-11T06:59Z,"DOPEMAN love all your games, ever one of them has worked on Vista 32bit without any troubles.  Unrar and play just like you say.  I am worried about this one because you say you ripped the cutscenes.  I'm sure the game works fine but don't we need the cutscenes for the storyline of the game?

Please don't take me wrong, I love your work and hope you keep up all the great releases."

,DizConnected,2007-08-12T09:11Z,"Great game but I have a problem.  I'm flying in a chopper kind of thing chasing another one.  I shoot all the people with the rocket launchers, and all the gunships, etc.  I get to a point where there is a big gun the chopper I'm in won't go past until I take it out on foot.  When the chopper lands, and lets me out the screen goes white and one of my ""buddies"" says Rouge didn't make it.  I have full health but it seems I am dead.  Anyone else have this same problem?  I am already downloading the full version of this game to get the cutscenes so once its done I will install it in a different location and see if it does the same."
