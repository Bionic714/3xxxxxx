But you see, the few porn torrents I have uploaded so far, are only the tip of the iceberg, I still have a LOT of porn waiting to be uploaded. I could of course just slapped everything into one huge torrent, but I prefer to do things properly where things are sorted, in other words I want my torrents to have a certain degree of quality. "

VIRUS OR SPYWARE I CAN NO DELETE THE FOLDER IN ANY WAY 

NO JOKE"
,ElgerHz,2007-08-14T01:42Z,"To Kallaway: Thanks for the kind words mate :-)

To pedur: This torrent consists of a zip file with only pictures and a text file wihin it, so there can't be any virus or spyware included - it is just impossible! But sure, there's always the JPEG exploit ""virus"", but I have scanned all pictures for this exploit, and no files are infected!

The reason why you can't delete the folder is most likely because an application you have used on the pictures have stored the folder path in it's MRUD list. Just wait a day or two and you will be able to delete the folder.  "
