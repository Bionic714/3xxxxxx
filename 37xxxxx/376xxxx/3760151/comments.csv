,ricemar4,2007-12-23T04:11Z,"I unpacked the files and clicked on Install.exe but it says ""the system does not suppor full screen mode.""  Does anyone know what this means and how I can install the games?"
,joeynarcotic,2008-02-28T06:58Z,"I guess it means you're running Vista. Find a copy of Dosbox, you should be able to run it through that."

,AFXFAN,2008-10-18T20:13Z,"thanx these games are GREAT!!!
good UL"
,quiet_ame,2009-03-26T17:15Z,"You are missing the .BAT file for Leisure Suit Larry 3.... there should be a batch file called LSL3 in order to run the game...without that file, it won't run"
,halofubar,2009-07-10T16:30Z,"@quiet_ame: If LSL3 is installed in \SIERRA\LSL3, and assuming DOSBOX is also installed, create a batch file in your SIERRA directory like this:

\sierra\(dosbox_directory)\dosbox.exe \sierra\lsl3\sierra.com
