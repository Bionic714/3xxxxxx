,retardedgirl,2010-05-12T21:38Z,"I LOVE this movie! Thank you for uploading it!
Only problem is I can't view it in Quicktime (VLC works fantastic). Also I can't find the right quicktime codec for this .avi so I can burn it in Toast and watch it in my DVD-player. Help please.


By the way, this movie is dubbed because the sound was lost and refound first after Basquiat's death. All the other actors have their own voices though so it's no biggie."
