Never heard of this one. Seems to have good rating on IMDB.  Is it as freaky as IMDB claimed?"

,finerthingsrfree,2008-03-12T06:02Z,"Thanx soooo much!  I wish they would bring this show back with new episodes.
One of the few ""good"", well produced shows ever made for television. Most of the others tv programs {especially now on tv} are forgettable."

,sabekasamaru,2009-07-29T18:30Z,"we could really use more seeders cause i been getting fast downloads then they slow down then they speed up, and so on. The only problem they slow down to like 1-10 kb/s and i am very impatient, i mean i know that this might take a while but seriously need more seeds"

,defiance_sg,2011-10-29T04:23Z,"What's with the quality? After I finished downloading this and tried to watch an episode, I thought I'd downloaded the wrong show by mistake. My first impression was that I was looking at a TV show filmed in the seventies; the picture is grainy and hard to make out, and the sound is horrendous. Appreciate the upload, but I'll try to find a better torrent for this show. "

,cdiscord,2012-08-12T07:28Z,"Thanks, isock86! This show was a huge part of my childhood, I love it

fireflame65, you are a fucking idiot
The show aired from like 1997-2001. Of COURSE it's a TVrip. You're getting something for free anyway, what the hell did you expect? "
