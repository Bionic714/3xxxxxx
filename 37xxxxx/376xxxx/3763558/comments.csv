,totalni.blazen,2007-08-05T13:40Z,This is best version what i found on the net. Enjoy it!
,ihatempaa,2007-08-05T13:52Z,"This was uploaded 9 mins ago and already has 1400+ seeders and 1123+ leechers. This smells of a fake torrent by the mpaa with false tracker info. I am sorry if i am mistaken, but I have seen many of these in my time."
,ParasiteGod,2007-08-05T14:06Z,"I agree to ihatempaa, it looks a littlebit wierd"
,nygrenbjorn,2007-08-05T14:16Z,"Thats what I would think too, fakingfakinghell"
,planteneter,2007-08-05T15:50Z,"And the current uploader didnt post a single movie before, fishy!"
,planteneter,2007-08-05T15:54Z,Make sure you install a good IP filter for your torrentdownloader like peerguardian http://phoenixlabs.org/pg2/

,macchiato,2007-08-05T16:52Z,"Picture quality is totally OK, but the sound is low quality, and please don't argue."
,fottotopa,2007-08-06T14:44Z,Super quality! THANKS MOLOTOV! v9/a8!
,inkh,2007-08-06T17:59Z,"Some stupid ass have added ""Meat is murder"" stills and destroyed the movie at 1:40. "
,XeenoMorph,2007-08-06T18:58Z,"Damn ! Won't fit on a 700mb CD !!  How can I shrink this about 5% ??  Plays great on Media Player, but I want it on my TV, and I don't have a DVD burner !?!?!
Xeeno..."
,murmelfried,2007-08-07T00:08Z,"cool, great quality, thanks!"
,zigzag644,2007-08-07T16:01Z,"This is an excellent quality video, but inkh is right. This movie has been poisoned with a ""meat is murder"" video that fades in and out at 1:45, showing pigs getting slaughtered for about 15 seconds. This ""net graffiti"" is just another lame asshole desperately grasping for popularity by defacing something popular. It's sad to see this garbage, but don?t be surprised if more of this starts to appear in our videos."

Does anyone want a steak? Perhaps some bacon? I love seeing me some soon to be dead animal. Thank you for that. I am going to go and knowingly and satisfyingly kill me some animals now, so that I may eat me a big mac. "
,soren_lp,2007-08-08T11:45Z,"Fuck i hate all these fake dvdrip uploads. why cant people just use the original name from the relase gruop.
there have not been made any dvdrips yet. so this one i probably only a R5.."
,Davidjensen,2007-08-09T16:00Z,"Maybe someone can help me? Torrents is a bit new to me.! It seems to be missing a codec when i try to play the movie in media player? 
Where can i get that codec?"
,amilli,2007-08-10T00:13Z,You don't need codecs just download VLC Media Player at www.videolan.org
,_zartok_,2007-08-11T02:54Z,"Hey all that chatt about ""fake torrent"" and stuff.. cut ot out.. the one uploaded this hase probalby downloaded this torrent from a other site.. and the tracker has ben runing for a longer time but not on tpb's site.
gett it?"
,rodan_424,2007-08-12T01:06Z,Is it really a fake?? it should be downloaded from an other site... something like that i'll give it a try
,Salkkumies,2007-08-12T11:50Z,GOOD MOVIE! It come so fast.. Id like it very much.
,Salkkumies,2007-08-12T11:51Z,"Its not fake, It played very well^^"

,Genius2006,2007-08-14T19:10Z,"hi there,
coolio quality, I'm keep up seeding until I upload at least the full size of the movie. One more thing in the movie you can see 10second of shit at 1.45. Anyway it's a nice movie, worth to download"
,rodan_424,2007-08-15T17:01Z,"I give it a try cuse it's more seeders now...

,DJScribe,2007-08-19T08:08Z,"Meat is Murder @ 1:45, all else is fine. Thanks Blaze.."
,DJScribe,2007-08-19T08:09Z,Meat's no good for ya anyway.
,mateomiguel,2007-08-19T14:28Z,"At about 1:45 during some news update scene in the movie artificial static shows up and some video-only 'graffiti' comes up saying meat is murder with pictures of pigs getting electrocuted.  Its signed by LEN M. and has the links www.netgraffiti.tk and myspace.com/netgraffiti on it.  It doesn't interfere with the movie, cuz who cares about fake movie news anchors?  Pretty cool i'd say."
,Phillipez,2007-08-19T16:30Z,"not rip but okay quality.. v&aq-3,5/5"
,Herje666,2007-08-21T04:59Z,"Just because of the meat is murder thingy in the middle of this movie, i'm going to eat meet for a month straight!"
