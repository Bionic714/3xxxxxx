,ILKnight,2009-12-21T13:48Z,Is garbage. It can not open MIDI files. Although the sound is good
,Arecibo,2010-02-26T06:11Z,"ILKnight,

Why the hell would you want a standalone program to play MIDI files? Do it from your host, where normal people do."
,generation91,2010-09-07T16:31Z,"This torrent is a god! Unless you want to sound like 90% of those folks out there using Native Instruments Akoustik which is okay I guess. 

Well in any case, if you want to be unique, then this is the piano vst for you. It has a subtle feel and wonderful dynamics. 

If you love game music then I can tell you several composers who've went for titles such a Final Fantasy or Xenosaga, used the Bosendorfer as a standard."
