Days before Christmas, Sarah goes to visit her Aunt Lavinia's house in the village of Moreton Harwood, where Sarah is planning to stay, having decided to write a book and rest from her worldwide reportership. But Aunt Lavinia has mysteriously vanished, and nobody in the village knows what has happened to her. Sarah finds The Doctor has left her a special gift, a mobile computer named K-9 Mark 3. With help from K-9, Sarah sets out to discover Aunt Lavinia's fate, only to learn that her aunt has become the victim of a pagan cult that worships the ancient goddess Hecate, and is responsible for a number of killings. Can Sarah and K-9 save the day and solve the mystery?
