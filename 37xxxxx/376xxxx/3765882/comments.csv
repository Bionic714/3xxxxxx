,b4de4nden,2007-08-07T23:29Z,"Att. BELFONG

Seach google for answer, however u can try to run dxdiag from your start menu > run program and turn off all sound acceleration under the dxdiag sound flag. Try that, it should work, otherwise download and install the update to version 1.01 and recopy your crack file to the folder and play :D :D

Works, but u can read much more about it on the forums on the net... this is a known issue"
