A fair copy of the 'Then Came Bronson' movie (series pilot), made in 1969.  Taped from TV, edited out commercials and then put on DVD.  If you are a collector this is not for you.  If you want to watch the movie, this may be the right one.

NTSC-English only.

This is a re-upload of the original that was at: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3431514/Then_Came_Bronson.  I deleted the original torrent file so I can't re-seed (or figure out how to).  Smooth huh?

I'm going to super-seed this for a few days only on request and then it's up to you guys to keep it going.
