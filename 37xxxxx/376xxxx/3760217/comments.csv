,dennybKL,2007-08-03T14:51Z,Just saw your new uload. Thank You for putting back up.  I'd be glad to D/L and seed
,dennybKL,2007-08-03T19:13Z,"Well.  Have been trying to download this for last 4 hrs. it's not connecting yet for some reason. 

Any input or help?"
,dennybKL,2007-08-05T15:02Z,"Well Peer's are finaly able to connect to each other via tracker as of today....
NO Seed seen yet via Tracker."
,StryderKC,2007-08-05T23:35Z,My machine tanked ... it's back up.
,dennybKL,2007-08-13T14:13Z,"Peers are still talking and downloading. Most are currently limited / stuck at 93- 95%..  No complete copies yet

Seed has not been available for several days. We're very thankful file was reseeded at all on request.  Need just a little more DL time maybe from seed to git it all."
,dennybKL,2007-08-18T21:03Z,"Seems there are 5 of us topped out a 97.3% and can't finish the file. 

We are sill shareing for those that started late, and want the parts of the file we do have.

Primary seeder has not been available for more than a week or perhaps is it two now. Would be nice to finish and have more than one copy out there......    PLEASE "
,dennybKL,2007-08-21T15:13Z,"Man, it sure would be nice to finish this. 97.3% for a week or more."
,dennybKL,2007-09-14T23:36Z,"Man, it sure would be nice to finish this. 97.3% for 3 weeks or more now. Downloading this may have been a waste of time for the 2nd time (2 diff torrents) in a row !"
,dieselfaccio,2007-10-02T02:42Z,"i hear you, i'm @97.3 and was at around the same the last time this was seeded. when you put it up at least seed the full copy, PLEASE!"
,dieselfaccio,2007-10-05T03:33Z,"effing damnit, what a waste of time, again...OK paying $20 via PayPal for a DVD copy of this. email me at newtube at gmail dot com"
,StryderKC,2007-10-06T00:01Z,"Sorry guys ... all that talk about ""I'll seed forever"" must have been BS.  I'm not planning on seeding this anymore so if you can get a copy sent to you, please do so."
,StryderKC,2007-10-06T00:03Z,"Damnit, submitted too quickly.

Anyway, the torrent is gone, I waited till two people completed download before stopping it and moving everything to a new computer (and deleting the torrent files)."
,dennybKL,2007-10-21T00:35Z,"What a sorry shit.  

Why bother StryderKC if your not better commited to sharing the file to more than 2 people. I'd guess your calculation that you shared long enough is way F ing off.

As to ""I waited till two people completed download before stopping it and moving everything to a new computer (and deleting the torrent files). "" 

We some how Find that hard to beleave ! 

DON""T  DOWNLOAD FROM  STRYDERKC  !!  Waste of time !!!!!"
