This was originally aired on NBC in the 1990's.  I have transfered it from VHS to DVD to XviD. Ancient Prophecies deals with endtime scenarios, prophecies, predictions, and of course Visions of the Future.  I think John Hogue is a guest on this one too.  If anyone has Ancient Prophecies I, let me know of post it.

Enjoy...
