,Wiz2k,2007-08-02T22:36Z,DVD Shrink crack sounds useful considering that DVD Shrink is freeware and doesn't need a crack.
,rlruss,2007-08-03T01:52Z,No Kidding.  But maybe the uploader figures any one dumb enough to download a crack for DVD Shirink would be dumb enough to be running without Virus protection.

BUT try and download dvd shrink 2007 or 2008.
which is at www.dvdshrink.org
the newer versions are not freeware"
,Onkel_Razz,2008-02-29T17:44Z,"DVD Shrink will always be free, according to this link: http://dvdshrink.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=2307

If someone is asking for money for a version of DVD Shrink, you are being fooled."
