So this should be some extreme training I guess :D"
,lilwoodenboy,2007-08-07T22:39Z,yes this really is over-dubbed in Russian!   english version I found on mininova..
,1mh4rd,2008-06-13T01:41Z,"WELL SHIT ON ME, downloaded this only to find out somewon took a shit on the film with a dub.
no subs, and 2 languages at the same time, one over the other.
~SOUNDS LIKE A CRAPPY DUB."
,bolddog,2008-11-25T18:42Z,"it is a bad dub. you can feel the walls of the recording studio every time one of the mediocre russian voice actors ""delivers"" a line. terrible. there should be a law against dubbing. penalty: surgical removal of the voice box"
