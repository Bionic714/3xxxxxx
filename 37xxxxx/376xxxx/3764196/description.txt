Spriggan is an anim?ction film of extreme proportion. With production supervised by Katsuhiro Ãƒ?tomo (director of Akira), this is not surprising. Our main character is Yu Ominae, a 17 year old special operative, code named Spriggan. The story is one of warring covert government factions as they race to take possession of "Noah's Ark", an ancient artifact with immense power.
