[V],Kuthumi,2007-08-05T07:36Z,I don't think this uploader understands how the system works. He posted the same torrent on July 24 and completely failed to seed it. Now he has posted another 4 GiB film and one 700 Mb in 24 hours. Must have some upload speed!

And i donÂ´t understand what the problem is if i posted another video the same day???"
[V],Kuthumi,2007-08-07T09:04Z,"The problem is your limited upload speed, most uploaders post one at a time until some downloaders have reached 100% and can take over the seeding. So far, you have only seeded this torrent a little on and off so that no downloader has reached more than 27% at the moment."
