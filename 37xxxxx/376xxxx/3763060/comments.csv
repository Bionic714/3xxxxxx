,bdowns87,2010-02-24T22:06Z,"i think the organization thing is based on your pc and what ur using for downloading and storage and so on. i use utorrent and vlc media player and it all came up in good order, each album has its own folder which is good cus i hate organzing music myself lol, especially when u got alot of music lol. but the download works great man, thanks a bunch."
