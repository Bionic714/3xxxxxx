,Toyfreek,2007-10-06T11:15Z,will this work for all g3 based apple products or only imac's?
,pushf12,2008-03-17T02:33Z,"I tried this on a Power Mac G4, and it booted, but it refused to install.  I'm pretty sure that this image is only for Apple iMac G3 computers.

Good torrent."

,celebi23,2008-07-21T08:13Z,PLEASE SEEED.  I'm stuck at 95.9%
,solonoid,2008-08-04T21:26Z,Sorry all of the seeders left.  I got it six months ago and it was just what I needed.
,solonoid,2008-08-25T21:23Z,"Okay, I finally found where I left it.  It was on a disconnected drive in one of my unused machines.  So now I'm seeding once again."
,Xsniper,2009-12-01T21:03Z,"Please seed. I am trying to configure an old Mac G4, which has been stripped to it's bare bones. Any suggestions, that don't cost? Thanks."
,nitrous9200,2009-12-09T02:41Z,"Stuck at 76.6%!!! I need this badly, if you have the original file, PLEASE SEED! I will seed forever if I finish, I've got a 20mbit connection. I'm desperate for OS9 so I can update my firmware! :D"
,nitrous9200,2009-12-12T00:58Z,"Finally got it downloaded! Thanks all. I first made a couple of coasters on one of my desktops which annoyed me a bit, but then I switched to another PC and burned the image at slowest speed with the PowerISO trial. i then loaded my iMac G3 (DV SE, 500Mhz) into Open Firmware, loaded the disc and typed ""boot cd:,\\:tbxi"" and pressed enter. Bingo! Boots right up, clicked the Install Mac OS icon, followed the prompt and it's installing! THANK YOU AGAIN SO MUCH! Amazing torrent.
ps - this disc is from UK/Australia, as during the install prompt it asks you to choose between either of those two or any other country."
