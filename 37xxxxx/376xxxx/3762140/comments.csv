,Ultragod,2012-06-11T22:46Z,"I was SHOCKED how cool this is!  =:-o  WoW!  Very organic & quasi-Gothy thing with the ambience 2 the songs. I'm @ about 5GB so far.  Please people seed this & I will add my own seeding 4 this as it's exactly the sort of HUGE & unusual hard-2-find non-commercial type of kaleidoscope of flavors I am into seeding, like Medieval & world & really obscure stuff."
,Ultragod,2012-06-11T22:47Z,"Yeah 1 of the things I seed @ 100% 4 instance is 'One In The Jungle' compilation of radio  mixes that took me several YEARS 2 download, because everybody was like '98%' LoL"
,Ultragod,2012-06-28T22:27Z,"I've been sitting @ 99.2% for a while. I will be converting these to MP3 B 4 re-seeding, so the file size is about 10X smaller  =)  128Kbps sounds about identical 2 CD.  Please some1 come up here & give me the last 0.8%, thanx  =8^D"
