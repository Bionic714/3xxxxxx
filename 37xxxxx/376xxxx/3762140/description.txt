This is a large amount of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs shows out there. This is nearly 13gb. The idea is I'd share everything I have and you can use your bt client to decide which shows you want. I'm only gonna list the dates of the shows and you can check sets here. http://db.etree.org/bs_d.php?year=2002&artist_key=5595 If you grabbed any of these shows from Dime they should match these files so you can just help seed if you want. I have no idea if this uber-torrent will work or if there is enough interest for it but im giving it a shot.

If there are any questions or anything just ask and ill try to help out. I understand that is a massive torrent but I'll stick around until we get at least one seeder, that's if anyone is brave enough to try and download this whole thing.

Also if you have a show not listed in lossless let me know.


Since I'm sure 99% of these torrents have it I'll include it here:

Do not convert then trade mp3(lossy) format.
