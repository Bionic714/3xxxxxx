***** This torrent was made for people who like NS Music. *****
***** People who dosnt got anything to do, dont say anything*****
***** If you dont like NS music dont even bother post a comment since noone in here gives a damn about what you are saying *****

For those who didnt knew it allready;
Pluton Svea/Pro Patria aint live and kicking anymore, Jocke Karlsson has left the White Power movment(as far as I know) and is now playing in a Swedish band called 'VÃ¶lund Smed', and that band has nothing to do with White Power what so ever, its a gr8 band so dont think that VÃ¶lund Smed is a "Nazi Band" just becouse of this since they aint!

Got Request? If so, post it here!
