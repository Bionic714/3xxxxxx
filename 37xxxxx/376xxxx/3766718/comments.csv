I hate those people who just ignore the btmusic rules..."
,Terratari,2007-09-24T08:38Z,"I am looking for  Al Stewards ""Year of the Cat"" MFSL / Flac
and for Alan Parsons ""Tales of Mystery and Imagination"" MFSL / Flac
Can someone upload them pleeze ?!"
,fendermental,2008-01-13T19:20Z,"This an excellent recording, but there is no sound for the last 2 minutes of ""Money"". Don't remember this on the LP 30 years ago. Anyone else have the same problem?"
,stupidcorn,2008-02-11T19:03Z,"According to Wikipedia, ""[t]he only time there is a gap of silence on the whole album is between ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" and ""Money"", where there is a side change on the LP"".

So there you go. I suppose if it bothers you you could edit it out. I believe this release also require preemphasis, but I could be mistaken in that."

All is fine!"
,FatFreddy247,2008-10-12T12:35Z,Can one of you experts tell me why this version is so special and is it better than the recently remastered SACD 'purple' edition?
,traxtenberg,2008-12-07T11:26Z,"There is clear difference between Shine On Boxset and SACD version, but I cant' say which is better.
SACD has a little more midbass, but is still sounds fine. Downloading this for comparison"
,phrocket,2009-07-12T08:44Z,"Audiochecker tells me it looks MPEG with 92%  probability for some tracks while ""Could not qualify the source of this track"" for others.

Some help mates?"
