,mgscrk,2009-01-13T14:50Z,"The quality is quite bad indeed.
If you are after a better quality, download this one:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3857172/Metallica_Live_Tushino_Airfield__Moscow_1991_-_GOOD_QUALITY
or
http://isohunt.com/torrent_details/45449440
which is even better quality, at a 800 MB smaller size.
Also all versions of this show available on torrent sites are VHS rips so don't expect DVD quality."
