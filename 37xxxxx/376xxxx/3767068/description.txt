â?¢ 	David Lynch delivers a "stunning piece of work" 
(Chicago Tribune) with this "flamboyantly violent and erotic" 
(The Village Voice) tale of love on the run. Winner of the prestigious 
Palme d'Or at the Cannes International Film Festival, Wild At Heart 
is a twisted "rollercoaster ride to redemption through an American 
gothic heart of darkness" (Variety). If Lula (Laura Dern) knows one 
thing in this world, it's that she's destined to be with her ex-con 
boyfriend Sailor (Nicolas Cage) - no matter how many times her mama 
(Diane Ladd) tries to kill him. But when she and Sailor finally hit the 
road in a desperate bid to find happiness, their journey plunges them 
into a disturbing underworld filled with sexual secrets and dangerous 
desires that form a terrifying "tapestry of human extremity" (Variety).
