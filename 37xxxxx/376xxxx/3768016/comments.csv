,captdoy,2007-08-24T23:54Z,"Finally! Finished seeding. Now you guys take it to end, ok? I have piled up a great deal of torrents that need my tender loving care. xD

Peace, out."
,Sossekongen,2007-09-09T18:25Z,Seed please im stuck on 86.4%
,captdoy,2007-09-26T15:47Z,"Sossenkongen,

50 seeders, and I personally am seeding this right now. I hope that's enough seeding for you."
,andhelg,2007-12-03T21:40Z,"Having some trouble watching the episodes. It jumps from one scene to another. Could this be because it hasn`t downloaded 100%, just a few episodes? Is this a common problem?"
,amikron,2007-12-23T01:07Z,"A LOT of LEECHERS, barely any good bandwith out of the seeders. But thats been that way recently with ALL TORRENTS.

Can we get some seeding love up in this mofo?"
,captdoy,2007-12-23T15:04Z,"@andhelg
You need to finish the ENTIRE torrent before you try watching it. BT works by downloading pieces by popularity and not sequentially, so yes it would jump from scene to scene if you use a video player that plays incomplete video files.

@amikron
I'll try reseeding this now. Sorry for the speeds."
