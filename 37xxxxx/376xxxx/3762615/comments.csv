,ajones1,2008-08-01T03:01Z,"To start with, redfoxhound, one word- 'shut-up'. You're a moron. Why do you have the right to shout abuse at Dayton, because YOU downloaded something YOU didn't like? If you don't like him, putting his time and effort uploading this, for YOU, then go out, and BUY the legal version. (Link is videocopilot.net, btw). So take your abuse, and shove it up your arse. Sincerely, shut-up."
