2x 256 up (Shared)
1x 512 up (Dedicated)"
,mu57i11,2007-08-04T19:13Z,"Sorry about the shit seeding, i was expecting to have at least the full 2.5 gb to be uploaded by now.
Will try and sort something out."
,mu57i11,2007-08-12T16:45Z,"Could we have some returning seeds?
Its just that the tracker says 1 seed and 14 leechers and that one seed is me. Trying to give a 2.5 gb file to 14 people is somewhat hard when you are also trying to use the internet."
,Shortcutss,2007-08-21T15:09Z,Hey; would you make a try more? I could be very interested both leech and seed
,mu57i11,2007-08-24T01:14Z,Sorry shortcuts i don't get you? Are you asking for more seeds?
,alynndan,2007-08-28T04:27Z,I would DIE for this collection. I'd lock myself in my room for days. Unfortunately it will take me 9 days to download it.
,mu57i11,2007-08-28T11:53Z,"Yeah 9 days is somewhat ott. I wouldn't mind if this was just starting off, but really 53 downloads and only 2 seeds, bit shitty really.
Sorry about the slow dl times."
,TPB_hunter,2008-02-10T21:54Z,Do you have to completely download all the files to open just one .zip? Thanks! Will be seeding as soon as done downloading.
,TPB_hunter,2008-02-20T00:23Z,Finished. Seeding now. Does this contain a clarinet?
,TPB_hunter,2008-02-20T01:20Z,WHAT!!!! 002+ Are not working!!!! WHY!!! It downloaded all the way. ????????
,mu57i11,2008-03-21T02:59Z,"if anyone is still wanting this and is having troubles with bad data I shal put another 10 gigs or so badck into this.
I'll probably be re upping this at some point as my collection has grown some what since this posting."
,mu57i11,2008-03-21T03:00Z,"and sorry tpb_hunter for things beeing corrupt - I can only assume that its only you as noone else has posted about it beeing a fake or anything.
Try using 7zip or if that fails stop seeding and do a force recheck in utorrent."
,TPB_hunter,2008-03-26T21:45Z,Thank you very much. 7zip is my new .zip extractor! Awesome torrent!
,Patinela,2008-09-19T04:57Z,"@mu57i11 .... only for 9 days.... i stood by the pc for Komplete reaktor 5  3 weeks .... the download had never gone over 200k for a torrent as big as 32,6 G.... "
