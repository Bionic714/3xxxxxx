I no it would have been better if I had not compressed this so you could pick and choose what you wanted, but having to upload 4.31 gb despite having 3 machines each on different connections would take some time.
This has been compressed into 1x 7.60 mb (7969814 bytes) and 54x 47.6mb (50000000 bytes) rar files.

Remember to seed this for other musicians like us and enjoy!
