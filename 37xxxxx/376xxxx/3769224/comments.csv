,WampireH,2007-08-20T17:24Z,someone seeding?
,Sachaztan,2007-08-31T17:47Z,"What the hell?? The tracker says 20 ppl are seeding, but in Bitlord it says theres not a single seeder???"
,MGhannu,2007-09-10T19:17Z,Dont work al files are .bc ends :(
,Nargathos,2007-09-13T21:13Z,"@MGhannu: that probably something your torrent program did for. Ive choosed that my Âľtorrent renames files to .!ut aslong as the files arent 100% done, in your case perhaps it failed to remove the .bc when done. try rename them yourself manually"
,sunny30,2007-09-26T21:12Z,Please please seed...
,Footee,2007-10-11T16:03Z,"Someone seed please! I need only S01E14-S01E20.

,goalerexpert,2007-11-28T02:14Z,Man...how do you play these files... I downloaded a VCL player and still nothing.  I can play the sample and thats it.  
,Lussan,2008-01-13T23:33Z,"Epesiode 7 is fake ore broken. I added the whole season and when the e10 was showing ""previously"" I didnÂ´t recognised it. t turns out that it was e07 that was wrong.... =/"
,clanord,2008-01-21T17:48Z,"I really would like to get my hand on this...
...and i hope someone is seeding!?"
,Jeshua,2008-02-05T16:09Z,"Hey.. No one is seeding this anymore!!!!

That`s a little lame :(

Well.. Carry on, men!"
,kjelli92,2008-02-27T19:16Z,crap !!
,wolvy23,2008-03-06T03:54Z,"If you just use Utorrent, you can select which files in the torrent you want and ignore the rest. So thats how you get just the files you want without dl'ing the whole season."
,goltian,2008-03-18T22:20Z,"Please Seed.... 

P.S i let always my ratio be over 4 then i delete if are many seeds if not i stay seeding."
,zaza1851983,2008-03-28T00:50Z,Thank you very much man
,mikeyc420,2008-04-21T00:36Z,"Hey everyone, I'm new to this site and i had a quick question about this torrent...I use Azureus and right now im d-loading this torrent. The icon is ""green"" and telling me everything is ""ok"" but i'm only connected to 5 people out of 150 seeders. Other torrents dont do this to me and i usually download 2 gigs in 30 minutes..any suggestions? Is it because im new? "
,zploek,2008-05-18T23:46Z,"mikeyc420
yes its because you're new, and because hardly you don't seed anything yourself. saying nice things about  the seeders and uploaders helps a lot, they will give you more bandwidth then.
seed more and little sucking up is good."

,dutto111,2008-06-01T13:43Z,Thanks for the Up

,virgoeyes,2008-06-01T16:02Z,"This is taking so much time...It says I got 5 days to wait untill completed, and I have been loading it for about 3 days now..."
,loringamadeus,2008-07-12T04:15Z,I was watching this season the other night and had my computer completely crash. It started with a corrupted c: drive then it deleted my mbr etc. etc. I was watching episode 10 I believe when this happened has anyone else experienced anything of this nature with this torrent?
,jbert,2009-01-08T19:10Z,It keeps telling me piece 166 failed hash check.  But at least it's still going.
