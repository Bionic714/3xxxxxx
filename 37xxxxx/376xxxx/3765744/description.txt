Synopsis: Winnie the Pooh, Tigger and the whole Hundred Acre Wood crew come together to help youngsters learn the benefits of respect, consideration, good behavior and imagination through a series four entertaining animated adventures. There's nothing like sharing those special "growing up moments" with good friends, and when Tigger's birthday celebrations go bad, the gang soon learns that the benefits of good behavior can make all the difference when trying to have a good time. A "Cheer Up Eeyore Game" offers youngsters a chance to recognize and relate to the feelings of others, and a Winnie the Pooh sing-along aims to get the little ones excited about behaving their best. ~ Jason Buchanan, All Movie Guide
