,eXXis,2007-08-06T13:00Z,How's the picture and audio? please answer I really need this shit!
,w01f,2007-08-06T13:08Z,"damn you guys are lame 300+ people want it but none says thanks. well i do...

THANK YOU Rupert77!!!"
,Evil__Homer,2007-08-07T08:10Z,"Audio = 7/10
Video = 4/10

Seeing as none of the 300 people who have downloaded this have posted any comments on the quality, I thought I'd give my opinion on it....

Now, this is only my opinion , but it looks very much like a TS to me, the picture shakes and moves and there's those black explosions you get on the screen in a cinema.  You know... those real quick fades/blurs.  Also the contrast is pretty bad, the characters are not the sharp yellow they should be but quite washed out.  My Denon amp picks the audio up as Dolby Pro Logic, which is different to the Dolby Digital 5.1 that it is listed as, even if it is upmixed from 2.0  Despite this, it is certainly not unwatchable.  If you can't wait for a DVD proper then this should satisfy your Simpsons urges for the time being.  These are only my opinions however, so go ahead and see for yourselves....

Many thanks to the uploader for his time and effort... always appreciated."

,menvafanda,2007-08-12T22:22Z,"rupert77 u think u can uppload this torrent again ? the first 3 vss-vibe files wont finish for me, it says that the first vss-vibe file is damaged."
,andyfox01,2007-08-16T09:56Z,"Cheers Rupert77
top notch quality definetley not a cam job.

Bonii and Remitec download WinRar then right click ""tss-vibe.part01""(other files will auto open) and click Extract here and a IMG file appears(as a Cd icon) and if you have Nero then if you double click the IMG then it will auto burn the movie for you."
,yoyo007,2007-08-17T01:56Z,R5 means good quality !!!! m8 i love R5
,Monkiii,2007-08-18T11:14Z,"Plz, seed !"
,yoyo007,2007-08-20T10:47Z,"stop at 99,8% for a week now :/"
,darkmdbeener,2007-08-21T06:20Z,will some one elaborate the meaning of r5
,darkmdbeener,2007-08-21T06:31Z,and this is some advice to the ones who dont understand the meaning of the multiple .rar files they're there to pack the program more eficiently. all you have to do is open winrar and highlight all the .rar's in this torent. they will unpack into the same file complileing the whole movie
,worriahbach,2007-08-26T13:18Z,Evil__Homer thanks for ur opinion !
,jameshall,2007-09-01T00:11Z,The rar-files Nos 02 & 03 won't finish for me. Anyone who can tell what is the problem here? It's been downloading for days but the files never get bigger than 93 and 90 % resp.
,Interceptor90,2007-09-03T18:05Z,"I usually donÂ´t  write comments but right now i feel like i have to. Just to thank you for the effort you put in to this. Know that it is appreciated.
Keep up the good work!

,Platinum66,2007-09-06T12:49Z,"Please seed! I'm stuck on 99,7%."
,john11smith,2007-10-18T21:36Z,"R5 means: Region 5 - Russia
R1- US
R2 - West Europe"
,barton101,2012-07-30T13:40Z,"Next time, please include English subtitles for the hearing impaired. They are also good for people who don't have English as their first language. Subtitles take up hardly any extra space and they make for more seeders because the torrent is useful to more people."
