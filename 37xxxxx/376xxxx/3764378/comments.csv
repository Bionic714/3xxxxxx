,dan1960,2007-08-09T05:06Z,Whats wrong with http://free.grisoft.com ? Why do we need Pro when they are giving us a free version that works great and has for years?
,bushisdead,2007-08-09T21:41Z,"dan1960: you can`t use free version for local networks, e.g. back-up drives etc"

Hmmmmmmmmmmm.... local networks.. hmmmmmm............
U can use free version as much as u can use pro..
Just that free version doesnt include all options, like anti spyware & firewall.
So if you use free version, u need to get other program protecting from spyware, acg free doesnt do shit to most spywares."

,HDMI_GUY,2010-02-18T05:12Z,"Simple solution: 
Use the AVG 9 pro with serial gen. It works great. I hope this is the same keygen version I got (good for updates) when I downloaded and license is good tp 2018.

,HDMI_GUY,2010-02-18T14:39Z,"NK just the serials?

When downloading the torrent un-check all the big stuff and only download the txt file that contains the serial no (or whatever part of the download you require e.g. .srt file). On an opposite note sometimes I will find a torrent dead at 99 percent. Sometimes your download is actually complete as people are excluding files such as my_site_nfo.txt. The actual exe or video is complete. Don't stop the download just try the file you need and see if it is complete."
