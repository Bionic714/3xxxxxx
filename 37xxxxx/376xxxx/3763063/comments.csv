,..JWilson..,2007-08-07T00:37Z,"Recently Scanned With updated Mcafee Virus Scan, and found nothing, Don't have a clue where all that came from. I've also had others download it without any Virus's found. If you Don't want to download it then don't, But I'm sure there is nothing wrong with the file. Enjoy the game all"
,ystokes,2007-08-13T09:13Z,I have no idea where you got it but I copied the disc to my external hard drive in it's own folder then zipped that folder. Nor do I find any of those files you mention anywhere on my computer.
,polter,2007-09-06T09:15Z,"Quit complaining, you losers. this file is free. and if u detected viruses, just clean them."
,polter,2007-09-06T09:15Z,but how come there's 8 seeders listed and I got only 1 in my download? Is this file bogus?
,marcusn,2007-10-14T22:03Z,"it's probably the SP2 Service Pack for Windows XP that makes it difficult to install it, i've heard. I have downloaded 7 different releases / rips and no one is working. After SP 2 i can't get it to work..."
,erikdrol,2008-02-03T11:20Z,"Does it work on Vista?
