,gotr00t,2007-08-09T14:28Z,"would have been nice to leave the extras in.

as the UK version of weeds season 2 dvd dosnt have ""the tools of the trade"" included in because the bbfc decided it would incourage people to grow there own.

so if any one can supply an un edited verson of disk one and 2 that would be great thanks. "
,SetherCraze,2007-09-17T04:59Z,why can i not view any of these files. There is one file for the first disk and i burned it as an ISO image to a disk bu there are 95 for this one. Any chance someone can upload a single file for disk 2 or tell me how to burn these 95 files to a disk using NERO
,mattbuzbee,2008-03-29T21:44Z,Would be better if it wasn't zipped
,tangoandcache,2009-09-05T08:53Z,how the hell do you burn this? why didnt you just rip it as a video ts folder.
