IMDB Rating: 3.0/10"
,TedRosevelt,2007-08-02T17:02Z,Tits!
,carv,2007-08-09T22:33Z,ffs RubberTow! Quit upping new stuff until somebody is able to download a complete copy of any of your previous material. It will take months to get any of this stuff at your current seeding rate!
,bob62235,2007-08-25T05:14Z,"Thankyou so much for ripping and sharing the Andy Sidaris collection of great TNA vids. I've been looking for these videos in good quality for a long time. You provided more than I could imagine. Thankyou Thankyou Thankyou.
BTW YOU ROCK and I will seed for as long as possible to celebrate your great deed."

,yolt13,2008-09-17T00:31Z,"NEED HELP WITH SIDARIS FILMS! 

Looking for Andy Sidaris' early films, STACEY and SEVEN (aka SEVANO'S SEVEN). The only place online to get them is Cinemageddon, but when I try to register there, they don't send me a confirmation email. If anyone out there has these movies, or is a Cinemageddon members and can get them, please upload them to Pirate Bay! I'll be eternally grateful, and I'll seed indefinitely!

Please help! Thanks!"
,maajed,2009-06-03T07:43Z,that's a nice upload dude. Keep it up! For all those who want to see a trailer first: it's on youtube. Cheers.
