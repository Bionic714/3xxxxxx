Some days there's a mission.  This one was to remove the DRM from a protected video (Wimbledon Finals [Federer is fricken God] d/l from Wimbledon.org).

Read through some forums, sometimes noticing I'd be reading a thread from 2003.  Finally decided to check the torrents.

Find the FairPlay stuff (v1.3 apparently the lates), but I always got errors when hitting 'Start'.  Knowing it's complicated and not wanting to get all into it (I forgot to mention I rolled back WMP 11 to 9 on XP), I was about to call it a day when I saw this torrent (Mirakagi's).

In short, it worked.  With the protected match playing, I ran the mirakagi.exe, and it appeared to say it found something.

Then I ran the included FairUse exe, and bam -- converted.

So... hopefully it'll work for you too.   :)"

Anyone know what causes this? 

I'm thinking it'd be cus I put pro in this pc recently, and fucked it up. What does Anon think?"
