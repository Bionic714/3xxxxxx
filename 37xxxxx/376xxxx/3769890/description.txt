Series 3 follows the same format as series 2, with the following differences:

Ramsay is raising lambs in his garden, which are set to be slaughtered near the end of the series. They are named Charlotte and Gavin, after Charlotte Church and Gavin Henson. The lambs are a Charollais-Welsh cross.[2] Charlotte has been killed by an unknown animal, possibly a big cat.[3] Gavin escaped slaughter because he was treated with antibiotics. 
Fast food is the target of the underlying campaign, proving that fast food doesn't have to come out of a microwave. 
The amateur brigades are competing to cook in Gordon's restaurant at Claridge's. The brigade with the most amount of paying customers at the end of the series, will win. 
The series is running a competition to find a new "Fanny Cradock", and the winner will get a regular slot on the show.
