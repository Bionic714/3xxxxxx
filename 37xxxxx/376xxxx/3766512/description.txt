 	Three stories adapted from the work of Edgar Allen Poe:
1. Morella
2. The Black Cat
3. Mr. Valdemar
-
This triple treat of terror is a three-episode "blood-dripping package 
that includes murder, necrophilia, dementia, live burials, open tombs, 
exhumation, resurrection, zombies and feline vengeance," resulting in 
nothing less than "juicy entertainment" and "spine-chilling cinema". 
Mix in three of horrordom's greatest villains, Vincent Price, Peter 
Lorre and Basil Rathbone, and you've got a shocker you dare 
not to watch alone!
Price stars in all three episodes, including Morella, in which a man is 
haunted after blaming his young daughter for the death of his wife. 
In The Black Cat, a pair of illicit lovers are buried alive by a jealous 
husband, and in The Case Of M. Valdemar, a sorcerer's spell 
backfires when he sentences an innocent man to living hell.
