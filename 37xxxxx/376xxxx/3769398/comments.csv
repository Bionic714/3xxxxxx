,Risket,2009-04-09T20:08Z,"The only one that works for me is Royal Noir. The others open my Appearance window but do not show the actual theme. Royal Noir doesn't get added to the ""Windows and Buttons"" drop-down menu either. The only way I can use it is by double-clicking on the "".msstyles"" file."
