,warez_R_us,2007-12-02T09:24Z,"I think I have the same problem as Audio pirate. Serial worked during install, and after that working as the full version. Next time I try to use it ask for a update email with the serial. My guess is that g-force autoupdated to the latest version in which this serial is not valid. Anybody know how to solve this? Like how to turn off autoupdate (if that is the prob like i assume) "
,warez_R_us,2007-12-02T09:26Z,"...and when submitting the same serial again I get ""error reverting to trial version"" "
,warez_R_us,2007-12-03T21:01Z,"Same prob. with the 3.7.3 build release... Installed with serial and work as full version, but if I restart my mediaplayer, it ask for a serial, and it's not the same coz I get ""error revert to trial. 

I have Vista 64 if that have anything to do with it. Anybody???"
,paskeharen,2007-12-06T21:02Z,"Same problem here, i have vista 32, I have tried 2 newer versons and one some older, only the old one works, but it sucks!..."
,UtopianWave,2007-12-08T00:05Z,"Whats the new code for platinum? I cant seem to get the stupid trial bar to leave now!!! I love the visuals but daM*, Ive loaded everything according to setup, is there some other code I don't seem to get ?"
,UtopianWave,2007-12-08T00:08Z,"It's NOT an O.S. problem, Sound Spectrum has seem to have found the glicthe` and sent a code out to all registered users. Now there seems to be another code to crack the trial with 3.7.1 but WHAt is the key question..."
,iam1ofu,2007-12-21T09:21Z,yip same prob here...gone back to trial version...anyone got the solution to this prob? plz help out
,Draecoda,2007-12-21T10:09Z,"From what I understand, this release is defunct so don't bother downloading it...  I currently am working on this here:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3559588/G-Force_3.00_Platinum__amp__Screensaver__amp__Standalone

If this does not work, you will here form me.. If it works, assume I will seed it with the few others...

Enjoy and Merry Christmas"
,MehdiSara,2007-12-21T13:06Z,Tanx so match! I'm very happy.
,DamnBush,2008-01-04T14:17Z,"i tried the code about 20 times, doesnt work for some reason."
,g25racer,2008-02-02T02:52Z,Workds great except fraps wont work with it. Darn. This also has a nice pic taking button. 
,iam2b,2008-03-08T16:22Z,works in platinum mode if you completely disallow internet access through your security software...then pull up standalone version and enter the serial given above...also do not allow active-x controls if you get any url link...windows xp
,iam2b,2008-03-08T16:25Z,would also mention a public share program that generates fractal art continuously as screensaver at: http://www.electricsheep.org/index.cgi?&menu=download
,Azagedon,2008-06-18T10:54Z,"1. Disable your internet (right click on the computer icon in the tray and disable)

2. Install and paste key in as normal

3. open music player and wait for the Gforce toolbar to pop up, go into settings and untick ""check for updates (weekly)""

4. Job done :D"
,robin9080,2010-09-25T14:22Z,thank you !!! it worked ;p

,LordNitro2008,2011-06-25T02:41Z,"The code dont work for me. This is 6/24/2011. It saying there is a License Error Reverting back to Trial Version.

This same code the guy says above my post DOES NOT WORK ANY MORE!! If you get it to work then let us know. Maybe the program is messed up when i downloaded it."
,melybo,2012-06-03T20:10Z,"Today is 6/13/12. It works perfectly.
1. Install using NEZCC-14VFD-XQH67-4YUR8-KK1XW-2MMB4-FMLVL-7Z 
2. Uncheck the 2 autoupdate after installation is completed. DO NOT START IT YET!
3. Disconnect internet. (Network and Internet>change adapter settings>right click>disable. 
4. Start G-force.
5. In the G-force toolbar turn off ""check for updates"" which is located in ""toolbar preferences""
6. Now block the program in windows firewall. >Control Panel>System + Security>Allow a program or feature thru windows firewall. 
7. Soundspectrum G-Force will be on this list. Highlight it and click ""remove"".
8. Turn internet back on.
9. Turn on music
10. Smoke and enjoy!"
,melybo,2012-06-03T20:21Z,"If you already tried to install and failed soundspectrum leaves behind folders to permanently disable. You have to delete these 2 folders. 

1.) Go to Computer\C:\Progam Files\SoundSpectrum and delete the SoundSpectrum folder there manually.

2.)Next go to ""Computer\C:\Users\*your user name here folder*\AppData\Roaming- And Delete the SoundSpectrum Folder located there manually."
,Guidan01,2012-08-08T11:20Z,Ive been using G-Force for years and it always works perfectly in windows media player. Every time i install Winamp though it reverts to the trial version. It would be great if someone could figure out how to get it to work with Winamp.
