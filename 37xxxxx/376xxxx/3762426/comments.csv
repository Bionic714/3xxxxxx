,jdoubles,2007-08-04T10:45Z,"NTSC or PAL, thanx?"
,BlackBird1010111,2007-08-04T18:49Z,"NTSC, but ripped to be region 0, so it should play in any player."
,chikitychinaguy,2007-08-14T00:35Z,is there any way we can get some seeders??
,BlackBird1010111,2007-08-14T21:33Z,"Seeding, but bandwidth is low. I'll have more up for this one fairly soon."
,BlackBird1010111,2007-08-24T09:21Z,"Read the comments, PLEASE ..............

Requesting a seed isn't going to make it go any faster. 40 gigs is a lot to initial seed."
,BlackBird1010111,2007-09-08T22:43Z,"Hey guys, sorry this one still isn't done. =/

Trying to seed when I'm out at other access points to help out, but everything's been really low lately. Just hang in there, keep what's out there seeded, and I'll get it done as soon as I can."
,Elrond023,2007-09-19T19:24Z,"Hey BlackBird!!  First off thanks for one of the upload I've been waiting for for a long while now.  Not trying to bug you, but just wanting to know when you think the remaing 30% will be uploaded?

Thanks again!!"
,zorrua,2007-09-19T23:08Z,"Are subtitles for spanish???

Thanks for all!"
,BlackBird1010111,2007-09-21T08:49Z,"Subtitles should be as listed -- English, French, and Spanish.
It's moving along...slowly. I'll try to get the remainder pushed out within a few days, but it's really up to you guys to continue seeding. It looks like most of you are helping, so keep it up and it'll all be over soon. =)"
,zorrua,2007-09-21T22:56Z,"Thank you very much! We will start seeding soon.

Someone know if is there is other file with spanisk language in AUDIO?"
,BlackBird1010111,2007-09-29T06:19Z,"I'm assuming that the disappearing clients that were at 99.9% means it is finishing...congrats, and sorry it took so damn long.

Keep it seeded; share the love."
,schmolch,2007-11-28T07:58Z,"Great Up, thx a'lot!

Btw. there is also a well-seeded HDTV-rip (1280x720) on mvgroup."
,turok2005,2007-12-28T03:39Z,"It took me from 21 Nov 2007 to finally get this down and was completely, i mean completely excited. But now i'm all frustrated as i have no clue how to put this on a DVD as it keeps telling me it's too big.

Any help, thanks for the up as i'm seeding right now"
,JLiu,2008-01-05T05:13Z,"I'm a bit confused - even if DVD's are about 4.5GB, shouldn't 5 discs only be about 22GB? Why is this torrent 36.5 GB?"
,BlackBird1010111,2008-01-17T00:31Z,"Sorry, haven't checked into this one for a while. I'll start seeding again if others haven't kept it going.

As far as the DVD size goes, the series comes on dual-layer discs. You can use various programs to drop the size to DVD5 (DVDFab and DVD Shrink can do that), but to burn the ISO files here you'll need dual-layer dvd discs (8.5GB) and a capable burner."
,lalojamesliz,2008-01-26T17:07Z,is this in 1080p?
,BlackBird1010111,2008-01-28T21:08Z,"No, it's not 1080p. This is the DVD format, not HD-DVD or Blu-ray."
,khoi16,2008-01-29T04:43Z,"Hii i know my question may be out of the main subject but i'm hesitating to download this torrent. Because 36G is a big deal..

My problem is : i'm already downloading this torrent (actually at 67%) from Enigma907 http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3812144/Planet.Earth.2007.5DiSC.NORDiC.PAL.DVD9-SuomiPoika

but since 3 persons said that the video quality was really bad... i just wanted to know if someone found the same observations too.. and
if so i'll download this torrent..
Thx alot!"
,BlackBird1010111,2008-02-01T04:50Z,"khoi16 -
Well, I can't vouch for the quality in this download, as I didn't download it but created it originally, and persuading you to download this doesn't really benefit me in any way, but....

After downloading and unraring, you should get a bit-for-bit image of the original DVDs, the same you would get off the shelf (minus any region/copy protection of course). If you don't want to get it all at once, just download one of the five files. It's split into five different .rar files, each with one disc inside. Do the same with the other download. If one sucks, go with the other."
,the_torrent_seeder,2008-04-06T23:45Z,OMFG!!!!!   if i download this then my hard-drive will be full
,Wyldskut,2009-01-30T09:10Z,"Please seed i'am stuck on 99,9% :-(  "
,rumsfeld69,2009-02-06T03:41Z,"THANK YOU.

Untouched NTSC SD DVDs of this series are very hard to find."
,pandaemonium9,2010-09-20T07:11Z,"hey, I really liked the first two dvd's from this upload. However, I am stuck at 99,7% and cannot view the other 3 dvds and would like to know if you can re-seed this torrent. Thanks"
,orbe_alio,2011-01-04T03:33Z,"Yeah I'm stuck at 99.7 percent as well. Got the first two discs but the last three are still incomplete.
Could someone please seed. Just for a bit. I can seed when I'm done. Thanks.

Great upload by the way."
,gondorsp,2012-01-11T11:37Z,"Please seed this torrent, stopped at 80%.
thanks"
