,dotcomvictom,2008-06-01T20:35Z,"Thanks 4X-AXG, U R THE MAN!!! I just discovered your treasure chest of FS. I will gladly seed your stuff until I drop 

unless you advise otherwise, but first I need a little seeding help from your loyal followers.

Thanks soo much for the great upload :)> 

BTW, can anyone suggest where I can purchase some used HW (peddles, etc..) to play these little gems more efficently?"
