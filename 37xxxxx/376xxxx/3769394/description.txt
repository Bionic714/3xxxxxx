Brendon Connelly Slackers are opportunists. They're very good at seeking out and doing what they enjoy. Problem is, the current culture tends to view slackers as do-nothing layabouts. In truth, when you let a slacker do something they enjoy--and pay them for it--you've got the worlds best employee on your hands. This manifesto is for the slackers who work for a living.

Including: Knowing that you're a slacker and coming to grips with it; understanding the difference between being an effective slacker @ work, and being lazy; understanding why you work; the Four Hour Rule and other tricks of the trade; locating influential champions who will spread the good news about you within the workplace...and more!

-LEGAL TORRENTS

Purpose:

create a balance, share the already free stuff,
public domain works, freeware, free music,
free ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.

show the copyright owners that torrent
websites shouldn't bear the responsibility
of what their users upload, torrent websites
are very much similar to google..

users upload what they want to upload,
download what they want to download,
and search for what they want to search..

by creating this balance and sharing the already free
stuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..
