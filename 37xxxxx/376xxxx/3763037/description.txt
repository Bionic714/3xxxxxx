This was created from the torrent located at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3759846/Top_100_Hot-Pop_Billboard_08-04-07_Charts

But with all the bullshit removed.  Some fucker thought it would be cute to put a shitload of characters and tags after every fucking filename, making the path so incredibly long that it has truoble extracting under a Windows system.

I've renamed all the songs to just the standard Artist - Song.mp3 format.  Also, the original torrent was a .ZIP file containing all the songs.  Seems the original poster doesn't understand the concept of torrents.  And why zip up mp3s?  They're already heavily compressed....

Dumb fucks.
