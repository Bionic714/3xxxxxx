Looking for Andy Sidaris' early films, STACEY and SEVEN (aka SEVANO'S SEVEN). The only place online to get them is Cinemageddon, but when I try to register there, they don't send me a confirmation email. If anyone out there has these movies, or is a Cinemageddon members and can get them, please upload them to Pirate Bay! I'll be eternally grateful, and I'll seed indefinitely!

Please help! Thanks!"
,sniper43,2008-09-19T23:44Z,another great download. from some of the comments that people give you. they must not know what seeds are. you are the one that posts the movie and also seed it. for download to go fast the people that get movie from you must seed it (that means leave it in there list) when a movie in there list says upload in progress they are helping so next person that downloads it will get it faster the more seeds the faster it goes
,fhilbert,2009-04-21T21:41Z,thx i'll seed for a while
