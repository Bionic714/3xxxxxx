Edge of Darkness was a landmark mini-series from the BBC. A classic suspense thriller set in contemporary Thatcherite Britain, the series captured accurately the paranoia of an age where Trident missiles shared headlines with anti-nuclear protestors.

The programme bears all the hallmarks of a classic, from the quality writing and subtle acting to the score, which is by turns mournful and suspenseful. The drama made stars of Peck and Whalley, and was rated by the British Film Institute as the 15th all-time best British television programme.
