,lukelomond,2008-02-13T19:13Z,"remember, when you get to 100% . SEED !!!!"
,23h,2008-04-10T16:02Z,3 days and still only 1.9% Someone seed please!
,23h,2008-04-14T03:58Z,"Still only 1.9%. I really would like to see this gritty drama again.

My last comment said I've been DL for 3 days, that was what Azureus tells me but when I check the torrent, it was first applied on March 25.

Some 19 days for 1.9%

So could someone please seed."
,23h,2008-04-19T08:07Z,"26 days for 4.3% at this rate I should be able to see it sometime in 2010.

Come on someone seed this torrent"
,bobchpth,2008-07-05T12:56Z,"WOW ! I am SO glad to find this one. Thank you so much for sharing.
:O)"
,bobchpth,2008-07-05T12:57Z,"Would be even better if there were some seeds

,bernanke,2008-08-04T22:26Z,is there something wrong with this torrent? it seeds incredible slowly and i have been allocating al my bandwith for seeding this but i still cant get any decent speed up or down. I will try to seed it for a long time once i have gotten it down so please please seed for now! thanks!
,bernanke,2008-08-04T22:35Z,
,bernanke,2008-08-04T22:37Z,"there is another torrent with divx ultra format for this series. search at torrentz com, the size is 3.9GB approx. "
,bernanke,2008-08-04T22:39Z,it is supposed to have subtitles but i cannot get them to work. also all episodes are in the same file. if u know how to watch that version with subtitles pls let me know. this torrent is taking forever...
,bernanke,2008-08-05T18:41Z,ok the tracker is broken. dont really know what that means except it takes forever to download this torrent!!! 
,bernanke,2008-08-05T20:40Z,ok i am almost finished with this torrent. i am allocating all my bandwith to this one so download now if you want to have it somewhat fast. pls can someone upload a proper torrent for this one (i dont know how to do it). it takes forever to download this one and it is a shame for it is a good serie. thanks for uploading this in the first place but would be great if someone could fix it! 
,bernanke,2008-08-07T00:17Z,WARNING THIS IS A REAL CRAP SERIES! Saw it a long time ago and liked it but seeing it again I can only say that it has not stood the test of time and it just seems silly and banal. I was really surprised to see that it was on the IMDB list for top mini series. Just my own opinion. 
,bernanke,2008-08-07T00:18Z,thanks for the upload anyway. it is nice to be able to see this older shows!
,Van_harpen,2009-09-14T22:13Z,"Crap my bared arse. This is one of the greatest, if not the greatest british Tele Drama's there is out there. Joe Don Baker made his euro bones in this movie and Zoe Wannamaker is Sterling. This is being remade by Mel Gibson for a 2010 movie release. Check wiki. "
,stillgame,2010-02-04T13:37Z,"@bernanke
This is still one of the best award winning TV dramas the BBC ever made. It is shame that some of  todays generation has the attention span of a retarded mayfly. 
I fear the Gibson remake is of the same subtlty, integrity and high standard as the Stalone remake of Get Carter"
,asha23,2010-02-15T17:12Z,Why does nobody ever seed on this pathetic fucking site. Just a bunch of fucking leeching scumbags. Thats why I normally use my private trackers. Every time I come here it's full of retards. Bitching at each other.... I hope they shut this fuck of a site down. It's worthless
,asha23,2010-02-15T17:13Z,SEED YOU DUMBASS NOOB FUCKS
,agrouse,2010-03-22T11:55Z,"@bernanke - A really stupid remark criticising one of the most influential and well regarded television drama series ever made.  

Don't let anyone else be put off by that ""crap"" remark, this series is very well worth viewing."
