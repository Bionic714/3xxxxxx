              Episode Notes:

          
          On 11 August 1980, cosmetics magnate and millionaire Dean Milo 
          was found dead in his mansion in an affluent suburb of gritty, 
          graceless Akron, Ohio. The murder shocked the boulevard of 
          billion-dollar corporations that help make Akron the Rubber 
          Capital of the World. And the subsequent investigation 
          unearthed an endless list of possible conspirators, almost all 
          of them Dean's relatives and all of them members of the Akron 
          community.
