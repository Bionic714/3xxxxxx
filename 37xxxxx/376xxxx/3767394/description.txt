Sleep-deprived individuals appear to have decreased psychological
and physical capabilities. Studies have shown how major
psychological aspects, such as alertness, complex mental
performance, and memory, are strongly affected by sleep deprivation.
Military use of psycbostimulants dates back many
years, especially in units that operate over long hours and
deprive soldiers of sleep. During prolonged military operations,
pilots are regulariy kept awake for hours and days without
fulfilling their biological sleep requirements. This consequently
affects their natural circadian rhythm. This article
deals with both the benefits and the side effects of two kinds
of psychostimulants. namely, dextroamphetamine. which is
more popular and is most widely used, and modafinil. which is
a relatively newer type. There is growing evidence that modafinil
has fewer side effects, in comparison with its predecessor
dextroamphetamine. while still maintaining all of the latter's
beneficiai characteristics.
