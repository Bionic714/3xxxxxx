,66dino66,2007-08-05T12:35Z,"New to torrents, how do I speed up the upload 
speed to get files to u guys faster?"
,wankan,2007-08-09T12:36Z,"Best way is to stop any torrent downloading you are doing , just do one upload at a time , and adjust your upload speed eg if you have 256kbps max up speed adjust your up speed to 25K (which will leave you 5k for browsing etc) ."
