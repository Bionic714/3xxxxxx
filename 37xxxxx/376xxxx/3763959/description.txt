ok this is an old game, talking about win 95 win 98 so try it out a few ways.it has a readme in there that might help out a little. this was working on vista x84 so it will work. there is a crack to do different things and i guess you are trying to get to a 3 way. don't post any questions because not sure it will work on different machines, all i know is i've had this game for quite a while and always worked. if you are having a problem, before you double click on the exe file, right click on it and go to compadability tab and tell it win95 or win98. if you want to play it i am sure you will figure it out, have fun
