Janet Street-Porter is this series' field correspondent. There were other changes from the format in Series 1:

The time slot of the show was pushed back to post-watershed to incorporate Ramsey's colourful language, this has remained the case into series 3. 
The restaurant seated 50 paying guests. If diners found any of their food unsatisfactory, they could choose not to pay for that item. 
A different amateur brigade worked in the F-Word kitchen each week. 
Instead of turkeys, this series featured Ramsay raising pigs in his garden, which he named Trinny and Susannah. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall returned to offer tips on raising the pigs. 
The celebrity pudding challenge was changed to a general cooking challenge. For example, the series premiere featured a lasagne cook-off between Gordon and Angela Griffin. 
This series emphasized the importance of Sunday lunch, with Ramsay teaching families how to prepare this meal on a regular basis. 
Giles Coren only appeared in the series in a limited capacity; he reported on the Pimp That Snack phenomenon and even baked a "pimped" Jaffa Cake for submission on the website.
