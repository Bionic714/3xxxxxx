i'm not sure if it's wont work.
Flightcrazy would you please mount your image to a virtual drive and start the installation to see it works???? you need to get through the advertise windows and let the installshield wizard starting the install  because the old upload was stopped there.when it begins to install then we have the hope.
thank you"
