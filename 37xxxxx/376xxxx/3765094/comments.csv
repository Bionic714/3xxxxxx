,fightingscott,2007-08-17T05:40Z,"i downloaded this same chicncream hacked river past software from a different uploader and every rar was filled with trojans.  i did open the rars unfortunately ...i didnt even install the programs but i guess it doesnt matter.  it took my many hours to set everything straight but permanent damage was done. i nearly lost my OS over this crap.  i'll probably end up reinstalling cause its still sluggish.  my registry, system32 dlls along with OS programs like rundll32 and services.exe were affected. CAUTION "
,fightingscott,2007-08-17T06:11Z,screw it..my OS is already f***ed from the other one.  i might as well sacrifice whats left of my OS to make sure this one is safe.  someone seed it and i'll test it out.
