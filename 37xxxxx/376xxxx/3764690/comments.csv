and its somewhat up to date, i dont know if they've got a new one out since i uploaded it."
,setasai,2008-04-27T09:45Z,i dont suppose you could upload them in FLAC could you? That'd be awesome.

,bambamm89,2008-10-11T09:05Z,It says mp3 or m4a  . . . which one is it?  I'd prefer mp3 if possible
,survivalist,2008-10-12T19:39Z,"Their both, some I had the cd's for and the others i ripped off my ipod"
