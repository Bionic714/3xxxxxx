This is a collection of 19 consol-emulators that I have downloaded.

Some of them I have personally never heard of, but I guess some of you geeky pirates have. Anywho, here is the emulators, no ROMs included, they can be downloaded from various places, I suggest http://romhustler.net for roms for the weird consols that noone knows. :)



Thanks for your attention, if you want a list of what emulators it contains, please just click "file list" and then use your brainpower.
