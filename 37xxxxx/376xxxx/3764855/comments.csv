Dude don't just download and play. At least seed while it installs and play some single player for a while. At least seed for a while"
,mc_maukka,2007-08-13T18:25Z,NO1 seeding atm omfg

,xLooky,2007-08-17T20:14Z,"I also finished, I'm now seeding =D. Alright question...after I installed the game and I open multiplayer, it won't let me make a profile?? =\ (Watch it be some stupid mistake... -_-) If anyone can help? THANKS!"
,devilred101,2007-08-18T21:30Z,"Ok, I've never gone wrong with following instructions before, but these instructions are very odd and in very bad english...

And yes I also got the problem where I can't make a profile and if I try to play single player I get an error saying error version mismatch or something"
,xLooky,2007-08-19T16:59Z,Yeah. It won't let me play single player either....I did get the multiplayer working by just dling  another torrent lol. Now it just sucks that I can't play single player -_-
,xLooky,2007-08-19T17:12Z,"Okay, I had to crack the single player .exe I got it from http://gamecopyworld.com/ [Search Call of Duty 2] and download v1.3 crack. Enjoy!! =)"
,JonoUK666,2007-08-19T18:00Z,Theres no install key with this
,xLooky,2007-08-21T04:11Z,"There is an install key, you have to open up the disc. Then click Crack, Crack again and Keygen folder.

You don't have to pay to play online, but you do need a valid CD-Key to play online, unless you join a server that doesn't use punkbuster. Then you're good to go."
,xLooky,2007-08-23T00:55Z,"Well, you one of the easiest way to get a valid cd-key is by buying the game. Most people don't want to buy, cause it's much more simpler to just download...

Anyway, you can buy. You can try forums, exchanging one cd-key for another (Ravenshield CD-Key for a Call of Duty 2 cd-key) or if you know someone who has the game ask them for the key."
,AdminVista,2007-08-23T17:42Z,Great !! Thx! 
,Arkchangel,2007-08-25T01:04Z,im having a problem in the single player it says failed to initialize renderer: version mismatch.  Any help appreciated
,xLooky,2007-08-25T03:39Z,Hello. You have to crack the single player. Go to http://gamecopyworld.com/ [Search Call of Duty 2] and download v1.3 Single Player crack. Enjoy!! =)
,Arkchangel,2007-08-25T07:18Z,TYVM it works now hehe so the patches is just for mp? (yeah im a noob ;p)
,xLooky,2007-08-26T02:10Z,"Yeah, the patch seems to be only for MP, and I guess the single player patch works too except it's probably version 1.2 or something. :)"

If you're having problems with single player: You have to crack the single player. Go to http://gamecopyworld.com/ [Search Call of Duty 2] and download v1.3 Single Player crack. 

If you're having trouble with Multiplayer, then open you CD/DVD drive and get the MP crack from the crack folder. Enjoy!! =)"
,dahruma,2007-08-30T23:53Z,"yea,so I can't freakin make a profile for multi. it lets me put in a name but never lets me save it. retarded. what gives?"
,dahruma,2007-08-31T02:23Z,"nvm, I got the sp crack and created my profile there. gah,but now I get ""cd key is allready in use"""
,dahruma,2007-08-31T05:44Z,"15-20 keys later and still no go, cracked servers work though..."
,xLooky,2007-08-31T19:17Z,"Yeah, you're going to need a key that no one is using for when you play on non-cracked servers...(original bought key is more accurate)."
,Rastoks,2007-09-01T12:39Z,I Hope it works :D
,hatemf90,2007-09-06T12:03Z,"Thanks for all the help looky :-)

Il download and see how far I go.."
,rtsisthebest,2007-09-12T22:41Z,"I am the only one seeding this and if i get a working cd-key ill seed at 300kb/sec

So fuck! get me one"
,hatemf90,2007-09-13T00:31Z,is the key required for both single and multiplayer?
,xLooky,2007-09-13T19:59Z,Um..I think so. You can play Single Player with any key. Now if you want to play Multiplayer you're going to need a valid online-working key (one that nobody is using).
,rtsisthebest,2007-09-13T21:12Z,"Do you think that buying the game, taking its cd-key and then returning it would work?"
,rtsisthebest,2007-09-13T21:14Z,OR could you at least give me the names of cracked servers?
,xLooky,2007-09-14T02:34Z,"Hahaha....HA. Um, I don't know the names of cracked servers. What you can do is, once you go into multi player, filter the servers. So that when it asks you if you want to show the servers with PunkBuster it doesn't. 
Once PunkBuster is off, the cd-key shouldn't matter. Cause PB is the one that bans CD-Keys when they're being used many times. Enjoy, Mr. Sarcasm =P."
,vampwolf10,2007-09-14T07:41Z,"Wow game is Amazing works great execept that the multiplayer says
??server=mismatch??

how do u fix that??"
,xLooky,2007-09-14T18:09Z,"Look in the CD, there will be a crack for the Multi Player. Copy that into the Activision folder, and then it should work. If it doesn't...I'll try and help you out. Enjoy!"
,rtsisthebest,2007-09-14T22:21Z,"haha noobs it worked...
 bought the game and returned it"

,kimcheeshop,2007-09-21T07:38Z,"Does this game work with Vista Home Premium? I'm having a hard time with it. It's giving me a Direct X Problem. Can anybody help me?

It says:

DirectX Error

DirectX(R) encountered an unrecoverable error. 

Check the DirectX(R) FAQ for possible solutions.


Things that I've done:

1. I've installed the 1.3 patch.

2. I've applied the 1.3 crack from gamecopyworld.

3. I've tried running the program as administrator.

4. I've tried setting the computability as xp service pack 2 and running as administrator.

Any help would be appreciated!!

Please post or just email me at adamdavidkim@gmail.com. 

Thanks guys."

What do you mean - ""What should I do to v1.3 single player crack""?? If you download the patch from gamecopyworld it should've patched up to 1.3...Sorry, I don't get what you mean =\. Do you mean v1.3 the multiplayer? If so, the crack for multiplayer is in the DVD drive"

,Bllacky,2009-10-18T14:23Z,"I saw a lot of DirectX problems... 

Call of Duty 2 requires DirectX 9.0c, and the problem is that Intel grafic card's doesn't support directX 9.0c. 

I had the same problem on one of the computers in my home LAN, and there is no solution for this problem. 

@psprapper
You probably have AVG, and AVG report's all keygens as Trojan.generic, what thay actually are..."
