Godard and J.P. Gorin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s hourlong essay on the star of their previous movie--a reflection on a photograph of Jane Fonda among the North Vietnamese. If I recall correctly, Pauline Kael found this movie aestheticized and repugnant; I find it aestheticized and beautiful. Godard\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Marxist period now does feel dilettantish, chosen (to quote John Gielgud in a bad spy movie) as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"an aesthetic decision more than anything else.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" But his dilettanterie feels like a grasp through the veil of form--which Godard, in rending it, mastered utterly--toward some fundamental truth about being human. He ultimately found it in the transcendental-poetic, Wallace Stevensish cosmos of his difficult \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"late\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" films; but am I the only person who finds this \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"didactic,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"agitprop\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" period of Godard among his most beautiful work?
