,crb123456,2007-08-06T17:35Z,why???
,Assassin-00,2007-08-06T21:09Z,"Hey guys, just wanted to clarify:
it's not a keygen. its a patcher."
,DakotaDC3,2007-08-16T04:37Z,"You guys say ""be careful"" and ""don't download"". What about telling us why?"
,raadden,2007-09-03T01:35Z,"ehm that risk is for EVERYTHING you download, and besides many antivirus programs and such find the patch as a malware because they are PAID todo so. Ofc there is a risk when you download a security related software that isnt legal.. but then you cant download SHIT!"
,StingZ,2007-09-10T22:02Z,"raaden, Shut the fuck up. You don't know what you're talking about. Anti-spyware program vendors don't put a program in the DB just because it's a crack. If it contains a spyware infection, it notifies you. They're not paid to do anything about cracks, and although i'm sure they'd like to stop piracy, they can't do anything about it, until we're in a year like Minority Report and they've got precrime going.. which is never."
,GoodolWhatshisface,2007-11-01T10:28Z,"O.K.Yes,antivirus programs are designed to find these things.But,only because they change your registry.So if you clean your registry often,you will save yourself a lot of confusion staying away from patches.

On the other hand,programs like AOL and Kaspersky act like viruses and people contaminate their machines with them willingly.So what the hell?You learn alot about computers by fucking them up,and FIXING them  constantly.Enjoy!"
,ilag2much,2011-01-06T02:37Z,"Sorry StingZ, but your dead wrong. Antivirus companies are PAID to add these keygens to detection lists, raadden is correct.

""You don't know what you're talking about. Anti-spyware program vendors don't put a program in the DB just because it's a crack.""

Eat those words they do, Malwarebytes, MSE, AVG, Mcafee, Avast, Avira, and Vipre all do. "
