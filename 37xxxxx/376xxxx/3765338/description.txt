Plot Outline: Based on a concept album project written by Andrew Lloyd Webber
and Tim Rice, and the subsequent long-running Broadway performance, this film
tells the story of the final 6 days in the life of Jesus Christ through the
troubled eyes of Judas Iscariot. Too often mis-labeled a musical, this film is
a \"rock opera.\" There are no spoken lines, everything is sung.
