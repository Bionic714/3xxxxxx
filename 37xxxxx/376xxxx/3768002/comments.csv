,obscuredlorelei,2008-03-10T22:52Z,"It's kinda hard to figure this out...like nothing really makes sense to me right now.
is there a tutorial site or something?

,RadioGnome77,2008-06-12T15:25Z,"just a warning to everyone who downloads this, my computer detected a Trojan in one of the files, so i would not recommend downloading this torrent"
,Anbumedic,2008-07-28T17:37Z,"You have any proof of the virus? and if there is one, why are there 20 seeders?

show proof before accusing someone."
,RadioGnome77,2008-08-15T14:36Z,"^

downloaded again, and AVG detected the treat again it was in : Vocaloid\Miriam\ Vocaloid.MIRIAM.v1.0.5.KeyGen-SPiRiT\keygen.exe
Trojan Horse Geneic10.ABSB, i'm not sure what that is, it could be nothing, just use at your own risk, also in another Vocaloid torrent  (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4111199/Vocaloid_Pack)  a few other people make mention of this threat.  "
,gtrbasse,2008-09-12T16:08Z,"Is there anybody who could generate something with the keygen for me, since my won't work, and then disappears...
AVG trouble
"
,lozlink,2008-10-26T07:40Z,"AVG Detected a general Trojan Horse while downloading this torrent (not after and when running, during the download) the location was c:/programfiles/bitlord/downloads/vocaloid and the rest of it was cut off (it wouldn't expand the file name) so just a warning. I am no longer downloading this file. 

As for why there are still seeders: if you question this, also think that those seeders may not have anti-virus and wouldn't know about the threat. Since they don't see a threat they seed, use logic people."
,Linkerzz,2008-12-02T05:19Z,Finally someone understands. THANK YOU LAWNOME!!!!!!!!
,Bealzabuth,2008-12-16T06:32Z,"Aww... 21 seeders and I'm only getting to use a few... D:

If you people hadn't already realized, keygens, patches, and hacks usually qualify as ""trojans"" because it is a fluke in the system, but it's a positive one! I didn't exactly understand at first either, but it doesn't take a stretch of the imagination to realize why anti-virus programs are bringing the ban-hammer down on stuff like this!"
,Bealzabuth,2008-12-17T05:52Z,"I got it to work (Not really sure how XD) but I don't understand how you get it to sing words, it just comes up with ""Ooh""."
,AiSarin,2009-02-05T19:31Z,"What lawnome said. ^^
Downloading this... I won't have any probs with installation and cracking, I'm sure... but eh... Hopefully I can make [SOME] sense of the program itself. :D"
,beyondinfinityy,2009-02-08T01:27Z,can somebody use the key generator and copy and paste some onto here please? my avg keeps deleting it and i have no other way to activate the vocaloid. thanks in advance.
,AndyParka,2009-04-08T15:03Z,"hey beyondinfinityy, ever think to maybe uninstall avg then run the keygens instead of spamming every vocaloid torrent with your crap."
,Criminet,2009-04-12T03:19Z,or just disable the virus proggy while u run the keygen ... Doh!!!
,hq9000,2009-05-08T22:11Z,"Hi all,

Just want to announce the first experiment of mine with vocaloid.

Check it out at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4884491/Song_made_with_Vocaloid_Miriam_as_a_lead_voice

do not forget to leave comments!"
,Tigaron,2009-06-15T16:20Z,"Excuse me...

I've downloaded this torrent, installed it, and found the keygen..

But when I attempt to use the keygen, it gives me an error message saying: 

Bad Mac Address

Could someone please tell me what that is and what I could do to fix it?

Sorry for the trouble."
,Equinox117,2009-06-18T18:48Z,"All these people sayin AVG picks up a trojan.... AVG picks up nearly every keygen or crack as a trojan.... ive been on a page hosted by google before and avg picked up viruses.... mates, you're on a torrent site... download another antivirus instead of using a free 1 like avg..... i have no problem with free antivirus programs but AVG is so crap its unbelievable... its good for finding viruses but when it says it has got rid of the virus it is usually still there! Scrap avg, use something else and you should have no problems with this torrent what so ever :)"
,xenthos88,2009-09-30T14:38Z,"Sweet song hq9000 pure profesisonalism!!, really like it, one of he best demos with miriam i ever heard so far! can wait till its installed :D"
,oddjobforlife,2009-12-01T04:56Z,"Why not sandbox the keygen so it doesn't harm your computer?

,Aquillium,2010-01-02T04:20Z,"Im so sick of reading peoples comments about keygens being virused because they use AVG. You have no idea how stupid you look to the rest of us, i actually singed up to pirate bay just to post this.

Do some googling for christs sake and you'll realise that your first biggest problem is that your using AVG.
