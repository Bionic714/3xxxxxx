,Skooog,2008-03-01T23:18Z,ever get the feeling that nobody's listening...?
,3261dan,2008-10-28T16:32Z,What is the deal with this ECM thing?  It doesnt save any space and is blatantly a malware app right?
,3261dan,2008-10-28T16:37Z,"Btw Maierm, like I said that ECM thing is pointless. Get urself 7zip, it can compress even ISOs to about 30% of original."

N00b! The reson it was ""ecm""-ed was becasue RAW images of CDs (1:1) copies also reads sunchannel data as compared to ISO images. Ecm allows for the compression of subchannel data, effectevily reducing download time and size...Also it takes kilobytes to include the un-ecm commandline tool, therefore sparing users the need for additional extraction tools! It also takes significantly less time and processor to extract than does 7z..Therfore making it an accpetable format for wider variety of users!

Fucking learn to keep shut Assfuck-tard, especially if you have nothing important to say!

Btw thanks to TEamRPG for a brilliant release again! Brialliant game, and awesome CD-Image! Thanks to maierm for the upload! 

Cheers!!!"

@maierm: Thanks for the torrent!

Unfortunately this is the Windows version of the game. I'm looking for the MS-DOS version... :-("
,dido1983,2011-04-07T07:11Z,"@Woof_Wuf PRO!

Anyway, as brilliant as this release may be, it did nothing for me to install the game. I started unecm.exe, it opened and immediately closed an ms-dos prompt window, the ecm-ed image remained ecm-ed, and whenever I try to mount any of those two files (the cue or the ecm-ed bin), Daemon tools says ""Unable to mount, file inaccessible"".

So, I guess what's more suitable for me, is some other, less brilliant release."
