In 1968, twelve years after they had first met backstage at the Grand Ole Opry, Johnny proposed to June during a live performance at the London Gardens, in London, Ontario, Canada. Their marriage spanned 35 years until June's death in May 2003. Rosanne Cash, June's stepdaughter, once stated that "if being a wife were a corporation, June would have been a CEO. It was her most treasured role." Roseanne also remembers that June loved flowers and often wore flowered things, and kept them all around her house.

June and Johnny had one child, John Carter Cash, who was born in 1970.

In 1967, she and Cash won a Grammy Award in the Best Country & Western Performance, Duet, Trio Or Group (vocal or instrumental) category for the song "Jackson." In 1970, they won again in the Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal category for the song, "If I Were a Carpenter."
