,TTheInfamous1,2008-11-20T16:10Z,"I've been trying to down load this torrent for 3 days now hoping that someone would be decent enough to help seed what they have downloaded. Come on people, stop with the hit and runs! It doesn't take much... Just let it run on your Computer. You dont even have to sit there and watch it!

Really though.... Does anyone ever help seed and share after they've downloaded what they need? I mean, isn't that how people in the bit-torrent community help each other out? All I see on here are people who use BT to get what they want and then never help seed or share. All those people do is ""HIT & RUN"" and its really annoying! That's what give the BT community such a bad name. All you selfish and greedy people that won't help others who may really need something. Is it too much to ask for you Hit and Runners to help a bit and seed what you just took? Get with the rest of us in this small yet hated by the mainstream community. Share a little. Its not too much to ask to seed for a few hours. The more people who seed and help out the faster things go, and with ease.

Sorry for the long rant. Im just getting annoyed with those few people that use BT and think its all just take what you want and they dont even have to share with anyone because no one else is going to be downloading that same torrent ever after you... What are the odds of that happening right???? LOL!

GET WITH IT PEOPLE AND SHARE YOUR TAKE!! There are others looking to use the same torrents."
,rittha,2008-12-25T04:39Z,"ok you might think im dub, but how do you seed?
I have been wanting to seed, but i dont know how.
So if someone know how, plz explain because not everyone know how to seed. "

,toph101,2009-02-06T20:53Z,"Is someone gonna seed this torrent? I have 1.6gb downloaded and although my download speed has dropped to zero for the last few days I am still seeding!
