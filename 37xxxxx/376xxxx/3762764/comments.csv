,Siffus,2007-08-16T09:19Z,"Hej kumarr, i?ll try, but i?m danish, so its difficult. My english is bad so you may be dont understand.

First you place your music, movie, prg,? in a map in documents. 
It can be the same where you have your downoads, or make a new map for oploads.

Then you make a torrent in your Torrents Client, that program you use for downloading, my is Azureus
In the menu, go to /files/make a torrent - a window comes op.
Chose the ?ekstern tracker? (it's danish)
Now you have to cut this URL in,  http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce
Then follow the different windows and it will end with you have a torrent for your music, movie, prg,?.

Now you go to Pirat Bays site, and make the opload
Down in the bottom of the side you find this  ?Upload torrent?. Open it and follow the windows. 

At last, and this is very, very important, you have to kickstart the torrent, by starting a download for yourself. It will tell you, that you allready have it, but it?s ok, it will start it."

First after you have done that, it will start"
