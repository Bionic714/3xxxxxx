,zombie_bomb,2007-08-10T02:37Z,"Also, I suggest The F-Ups cover of Mott the Hoople's ""All the Young Dudes"", it's one of those perfectly done covers where it fits its genre but stays true to the original song"

03 - Tesla - Beer Drinkers And Hell Raisers (ZZ Top).mp3 is on their 2nd disc (only released at their shows) of their latest CD. Yet I can't find this disc anywhere. Anyone know where I can find it at? Thanks."
