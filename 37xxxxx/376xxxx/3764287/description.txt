Hi everybody!

Here are some tools that i have been using get access to remote connections :14ph34r:

sharK_2.2 (Hard to find)

ProRAT2.0SE

Bifrost 2.2

Poison Ivy 2.3.0 (latest version)

If you dont know what they are, let me try to explain. You send somebody the server, and you connect to their PC.

I suggest using use sharK, cause its not detected by alot of the major antivirus, the other 3 will bring up alerts more then likely :( 

I also included; hacking ebooks,  port scanners, IP scanners, MAC address changer etc... very useful for finding open ports and such.


Here are some features of Shark-RAT (The best RAT):
Shark is an advanced remote administration tool written in VB6. With shark you will be able to administrate every PC in the world (using Windows OS) remotely. Here are some facts:

* Shark uses DS2 to encrypt the traffic 
* Shark is able to resume downloads and uploads when the server disconnects on the next connect 
* Compressed Transfers 
* Thumbnail Previews of Pictures 
* Key logger works with Keyboard hooking 
* You have a real DOS-Shell instead of dos-output like in the most rats 
* Interactive Process Blacklist 
* Virtual-Machine detection 
* Double-Compression in Screen cap & Web cam-Capture and much more. Shark is designed for professional remote administration, so you donÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t have colourful buttons etc and can enjoy lotÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s of right click-menus and hotkeys and stuff like histograms
