A re-uploaded torrent that was stuck in the 20% range with no seeder. I got the same ISO elsewhere and replaced it in place of the unfinished one. Then, did a force recheck in utorrent and I started initial seeding it to all until there was 2 complete copies. Alas, the torrent was deleted by the uploader or the site.

Screenshot of me bringing the torrent back from the dead :D
