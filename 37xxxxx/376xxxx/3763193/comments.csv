,Anarchist_UK,2007-08-09T22:34Z,"i open the setup but ""install windows xp"" is greyed out :|

and i don't know how to change BIOS and all that could somebody help please?

and does this mean i'll have to always boot from the disk?"
,NoaHime,2007-08-12T07:30Z,this didn't work for me at all.  Setup claims there are installer files missing off the disk.
,NoaHime,2007-08-12T23:19Z,"Ok... so I've tried a couple of Windows XP torrents here, and I keep getting an error during the installation saying some file is missing.

Any suggestions?"
,robert266,2007-08-12T23:23Z,"I have downloaded it :D
installed in virtual pc
works great :D even activated with another download here
but..
scan it when you have installed
9 trojan horses in it (C:/windows/system32)

scanned with AVG and NORTON 360
trojan.backdoor etc..

so you can use it,
but remove those stupid horses"

Enjoy!"
,Justinthenerd,2008-06-23T04:41Z,"So I've never downloaded any programs or OS's before so I'm basically a noob at this. I understand that I need to get a product key and what not, but how do I run it? Once I finish downloading it will it become a runnable file type or will I have to get some kind of program to open and run it. I can either partition my hard drive or do a full install, which ever I can get help on."
,_Nix0,2008-07-25T11:12Z,"Hey, it doesn't work to me. When I boot this image it only shows it's loading drivers (SCSI, GC ...etc...) But when it should start installing windows it only restarts my computer !!!"
,XweAponX,2008-08-13T23:10Z,"""But when it should start installing windows it only restarts my computer !!!""

-THAT's cos it is giving you the BLUE SCREEN OF DETH, and you have the system set to AUTOMATICALLY REBOOT instead of actually SHOWING you the info on the BSOD.
