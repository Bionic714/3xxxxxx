The Fresh Mixtape Vol. 1 is a collection of 4 mixes of banging club hip-hop, r&b and dancehall tracks. The mixes have been put together by the DJ-residents of â??The Freshâ?? club in Warsaw, Poland, which is THE place for hottest urban parties in Central Europe. This mixtape was given away during the first birthday bash of The Fresh at the beginning of 2007 in a very limited number of copies and instantly became a collectible item.
