SUMMARY

The classic vampire story by Bram Stoker revolves around a struggle
between good and evil, tradition and modernity, and lust versus
chastity. The author didn?t invent vampires, but his novel has so
captured the public?s imagination that he is rightly considered their
popularizer. Listen and you will meet not only the Count himself, but
heroes Jonathan Harker and Abraham Van Helsing, plus an array of
madmen, psychiatrists, and fair maidens who cross paths with the
fanged menace. (Summary by Paula)
