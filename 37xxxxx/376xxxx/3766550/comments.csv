,pilferlooter,2008-10-08T22:56Z,"Why is this not working for me? Does anyone has some experience with it? The only thing that i can do is to open the authorization manager. that's it. there isn't anything else I can do. I'm not even capable to go into the ""trial""version.

Ther is no ""cracked version"" and there is a empty texteditor file in the dmg, but apart from that there's only the pkg file

Is this about emptying my prefs? Cause the only pref i got was in my preference panes.

Can anyone give me some help on how to operate this.

It's not that this is the first cracked app i open.

thanx a lot"
