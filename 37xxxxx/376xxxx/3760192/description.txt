Tohuvabohu is industrial rock group KMFDM's upcoming sixteenth studio album, which is to be released on August 21, 2007, on the band's record label KMFDM Records and Metropolis Records. 
The word "tohuvabohu" is derived from the biblical Hebrew phrase "tohu va bohu", meaning "without form and void" or "chaos and utter confusion", which was used to describe the state of the earth before creation. The band describes their usage of the term as meaning "wild and chaotic". 
According to KMFDM Records' press release for Tohuvabohu, the album will feature a variety of sounds, including dance (â??Looking For Strangeâ??), metal (â??Saft und Kraftâ??), industrial (â??Spit or Swallowâ??), darkwave (â??Tohuvabohuâ??), epic (â??Bumayeâ??), and pop/rock (â??Fait Accompliâ??). The band also revealed the album will include songs featuring several languages previously unexplored by the group, including Latin, Hebrew, Lingala, and Spanish.
