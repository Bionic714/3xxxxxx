,atanasbg,2007-08-04T05:07Z,"Avast detect ""worm: Niklas-Q""  in Adobe PageMaker7.0.exe"
,orionstar007,2007-08-04T09:41Z,"Kaspersky and NOD32 don't find any virus here!!
I guess you have wrong alert from your antivirus."
,atanasbg,2007-08-05T05:20Z,only Adobe PageMaker7.0.exe is a threat. Others are fine
,babbletech,2007-08-06T06:13Z,"Can somebody test this for functionality and malware.

So many of these are either fake, don't work, or have more viruses than Britney Spears.
"
,babbletech,2007-08-06T06:49Z,"Ok, i've tried a few things and one thing that doesn't work for sure is the ZWT Master Collection keygen. In fact that does nothing - nothing opens when I double click it. 

I'm still checking out the rest."
,babbletech,2007-08-06T07:25Z,"Ok, the 'AGAiN"" Master Collection keygen is good - it works.

Choose telephone activation when doing this."
,orionstar007,2007-08-06T12:33Z,"""babbletech"" I know that ZWT Master Collection keygen.exe and Adobe Production Premium Keygen.exe don't start with some old win xp update. I don't know exactly the source of this bug. Maybe a windows update can fix this"
,Arnbjorn,2007-08-23T23:53Z,"IÂ´m new at this, how do I use the Keygen?
Pleas"
,orionstar007,2007-08-26T15:13Z,"Generate first a serial number and put it when is requested.
After that select phone activation and copy the activation code from app and paste in keygen to get requested activation code.
Copy this code and that it all!

Good Luck"
