,osc1882,2007-08-11T06:55Z,"For the 36 people who have downloaded this torrent, I can't seem to connect to the piratebay's tracker. Doing some searching around they say, that's just how the pirate bay is some time and to wait it out. So... here's for waiting."

,osc1882,2008-05-05T10:01Z,"Hey everyone, the poster of this torrent here. I'm sorry you were all stuck at the same time. :(  My hard drive crashed and I lost all of this. Thankfully I was able to get it back when demoind came back up ( I made a torrent there too ). I know how much this is a holy grail for me and many other people so enjoy."
,Hebbers,2008-05-11T14:09Z,Someone really needs to seed this file. What's the point in wasting all that bandwidth on cam's of Iron Man and retarded shit like that when the true potential of file sharing is making lost treasures like this available to the public?
,Silverswift,2008-05-17T11:57Z,GREAT TORRENT! You are right osc1882. They don't make 'em like they used to. I only wish there were more torrents like these. I've been searching for the Animaniacs for years. But this wil do in the meantime!!!
