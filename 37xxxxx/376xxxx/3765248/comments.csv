,ChronicKiller,2007-08-08T19:14Z,Someone please seed that has more than 4.2% done
,mktux,2007-08-10T13:56Z,please seed ! We all need this real music !
,mktux,2007-08-11T00:31Z,"Come on guys, Im already at 50% just let me finish and i will seed for a month, i dont have anything else ready to upload !"
,karlsbad,2007-08-11T01:15Z,"People have downloaded but aren't seeding!  Ive been the only person seeding since I uploaded it, but ill continue to do so until people start to seed for a faster download. C'mon people, it's torrent karma!!"
,mktux,2007-08-11T21:17Z,"Thx you for still seeding, im seeding the first 48% and i already got 2.134 ratio ! but until you dont seed enough for me to finish, i cant give the full discography to everyone."
,Seedamaniaq,2007-08-13T14:22Z,"Please help! - Allmost 100 Leechers (at 93.7%) are waiting with great interest for the seed....

What's wrong with people when breaking the seedings?  8(  No one should ever do that in order to keep this going. It's all about mutal satesfaction. The main problem of keeping the transfer going is the lack of graditude and responsability of balancing the seeding/leeching ratio. That's so much not ok....

Come on! - Please Seed or re-seed this great Torrent !!! Only 6.3% are missing now....
I do realy-realy like this great music! But it would be 100% nice to have it all right.

Hmmm I got an idea  8) 
- If I knew how to make my first torrent I would share the very file of this torrent ""Slightly_Stoopid_-_Chronchitis.3762820.TPB.torrent"" telling about this hopeless situation - Then we got the best chace of a re-seed - Sure many more will join us for a fast and easy 95%... But we all will get it done...
Let's experience the final satesfaction of a torrent chain-reaction... 8)"
,Seedamaniaq,2007-08-14T13:31Z,"Come a little bit closer to the sun...

""Slightly_Stoopid-Closer_To_The_Sun-2005-KG.3538967.TPB.torrent""
This torrent completes what's missing in this one ATM - It just got re-seeded in a nice 320KBps version.... BTW - This album realy swings....

Please rember to balance your seedings and never draw back the last ones! - that's what shareing's all about.... 8)"
,karlsbad,2007-08-15T00:16Z,What are you talking about?? This torrent includes a direct cd rip of Closer to the Sun Disk 1 and disk 2 which includes bonus tracks. Nothing is missing. People just need to seed.  This torrent also contains the rare EP - Slightly Not Stoned Enough To Eat Breakfast Yet Stoopid.  This is a perfect torrent!

Slightly Stoopid is an American band based in Ocean Beach, California,
who describe their music as ""a fusion of acoustic rock and blues with
reggae, hip-hop, and punk"". As a band, they have released seven albums
(2 live) with their fifth studio album, entitled ""Chronchitis"", 
released on August 7, 2007, not counting other bootleg albums created
by dedicated fans. The band was originally signed by Bradley
Nowell from the band Sublime to his label Skunk Records. Sublime was
obviously a great influence to the band, along with roots reggae bands
from Jamaica such as the Melodians, The Upsetters, Sugar Minott, and
Junior Murvin, just to name a few. Other non-reggae influences are Dr.
Dre, Sublime, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Police, & Miles Davis, along
with other genres such as rock, reggae, blues, roots, hip hop, metal, 
dub, and punk.

,pokinsmot,2008-07-12T08:27Z,"whats so ""bonus"" about disc 2 of Closer To The Sun?"
,karlsbad,2008-08-22T07:10Z,"Nothing that 'bonus' about it except for the fact that it comes on a seperate disk than the full closer to the sun album.  Kind of a 'B side' to the album I guess.  Enjoy!
