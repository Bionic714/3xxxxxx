What Veda wants, her mother-Mildred Pierce-provides. 
Even if Mildred must end her middle-class marriage, climb atop the 
male-dominated business world and marry a wealthy man she doesn't 
love. "I'll do anything." Mildred says in explaining her love for her 
daughter. But does anything include murder? 

From a novel by James M. Cain, Mildred Pierce is a classy murder 
mystery, a stylish film noir told from a woman's point of view. 
Joan Crawford's Mildred ended a two-year career slump, earned 
her a Best Actress Academy Award and revitalized her career. 
Just when you think you got this nominee for five other Oscars 
including Best Picture figured out, along comes a shocking twist ending!
