ok first off YES the size is right . HOW CAN SUCH A COOL GAME BE SO SMALL? will the models are probleey 10-50 k each and only about 100-800 models  and unpacked its size is only 30.1 MB (31,625,216 bytes)

YES this is the one that was never released in the usa and uk .

NO i do not know were to get the FULL english translated pack .but if ANY ONE DOES PLEASE LEAVE A COMMENT OF THE download address of the  * WORKING * 100% translated patch for english id be one happy S.O.B .

NO its not a demo 

yes its PROBLEy in the wrong category but i thought well its not for ps2 so other is closer than ps2 would be 

ok first off if ur a fan of king field like i and have only played the usa 1,2,3 then that would make this version 0 

the truth is usa's #1 kings field was number 2 and so on 

yes it works in Epsxe 


to get it to work first dl the epsxe pack off here not gonna find it its just too easy to find make sure u get the one with the bios file scph-1001 or something like that ..youll know it if u see it then use run iso with epsxe after u configure ..id use pete's open gl 2 if u got a good pc and me i use the super joy box psx game pad to pc with usb .i had to by it for like 20 its a good investment if i say so my self :) but i would recommend useing a gamepad that has same buttons as the psx game pad!
