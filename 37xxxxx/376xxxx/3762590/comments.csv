Only watchable if your player can force aspect to 16:9 and adjust contrast. Not recommended."
,jesuscodeine,2007-12-06T18:45Z,"I rate this very poor due to the fact you have to force aspect ratio. I have DivX player with Creative Mediasource. Now I get the pleasurable task of researching whether I can force ratio, or can stand to watch vertically stretched film. Nice!"
,jesuscodeine,2007-12-06T19:10Z,"OK OK. If you play it with DivX (mine is v6.6), you can force aspect ratio by right-clicking on screen. I never had to do that before. Lame. Thanks anyway for the movie."
,jesuscodeine,2008-01-03T15:44Z,"Has anyone burnt this to DVD? I can force ratio when I watch it, but can I force ratio when I burn this? Nero doesn't seem to have an option for this."
,jesuscodeine,2008-01-03T17:02Z,"I have spent hours now trying to force aspect ratio so I can burn it. I can force ratio when I watch it, just not burn it. Anyone have any ideas? I have Nero7 premium and DivX 6.8.

Whoever ripped this is an idiot, big time."
