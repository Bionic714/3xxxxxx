If you've ever wondered what men get upto when they are out on the town, look no further. Spend a painfully funny night on the tiles with Mike, Trent and friends as the 'Swingers' hit the clubs and bars looking for love, or even a little eye contact. When they're not trying to chat up women, they are talking about women and consoling each other about lost loves.

Starring:
Vince Vaughn, Jon Favreau and Heather Graham.

Enjoy!
