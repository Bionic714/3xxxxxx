I searched for this fabulous cartoon tv serie and never found it anywhere so I decided to release it. 

The source is very very bad, I tried to find a vhs copy of this on ebay or others places without success. But a month ago this guy on youtube posted them so I decided to make it easier for peoples to watch them. 

I have taken the 40 parts reassembled them and reencoded them in divx with some vhs quality enhancer filter and croped the annoying corruption on top and bottom of each of the 13 episodes. 

Its pretty rare and I hope someone somewhere release them with a proper source and I do this release only to make people interrested in the show.
