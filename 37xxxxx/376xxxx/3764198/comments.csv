,boomba,2007-08-22T14:43Z,"Installerade denna igår och den funkar prima. Installationen går snabbt och smärtfritt. Är inte alls så speciellt krävande. Tar ungefär 100mb mer ram än eXPerience Tiny XP version, plus att de är såå mycke snyggare:P Har inte hittat något som inte fungerat än. Vissa spel (tex. company of heroes) startas i ett fönster och är bara svart, men om högerklickar på genvägen och kryssar i ""run this program in compatility mode for:"" Och väljer windows XP så funkar de fint. Kan hända att de startar i window mode men då är de bara att trycka alt+enter så får du fullskärm. Så skulle ett spel inte funka så testa först och främst att göra så. Tack för UL! PS. Glöm inte ladda ner VISTA 32-bit drivrutiner till din hårdvara."

,jet_kakashi,2008-03-06T20:28Z,"So what you're saying is that when all of the RAR's get done downloading, uncompress them and burn them to a CD?  I hope that's correct."

,metavoid,2008-04-09T10:25Z,"Respect!
Very nice Vista.
Running fine on older PC with 256 ram.
Microsoft should hire ""eXperience""..
Both his TinyXP and this tinyVista gives me a far better felling out of the box than MS ever did...."
,fuctup.rm,2008-04-24T05:58Z,"I too had the problem where my installation would freeze at ""Expanding Files"" with error 0x8007001B. I tried over and over again, running through the installation procedure, then suddenly (magically), it worked on my fifth try. I am now happily running Vista on a Socket 478 P4 2.26Ghz system with 384MB of RAM. 

Thanks for the valuable upload!"
