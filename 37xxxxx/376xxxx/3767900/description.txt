This movie hasn't been cropped properly, you can see a white bar at the bottom. We included a screenshot in the torrent for you to check if you wanna download that Movie that way or not. If you wanna play this file without seeing that bar in MPC you can do so by doing this: CTRL+2 will move the picture down, then pressing the 8 key will glue the picture to the top and bottom.

 Enjoy another LaR release. Quality for the people.
