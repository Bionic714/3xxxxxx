,420dopeman,2007-08-11T23:02Z,"Sub. Its your cracktro that thows off some peeps virus scanners. The algorithm of the code contained in most cracktros almost always throw off scanners. Especially avg and other overzealous type scanners.

Just read under skidrows release of GRAW 2. There's tons of newbies that think that skidrow.exe is a virus. Its actually quite humorous. Check demonoid especially. They swear skidrow put a virus in their crack folder. (like a scene release would contain a virus, especially named after the release group. lol) check it out for a good laugh my virus free buddy."
