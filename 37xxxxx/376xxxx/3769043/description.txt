Man Bites Dog is a satirical, Belgian, black comedy mockumentary starring Benoît Poelvoorde. Released in 1992, its original French language title is C'est arrivé près de chez vous (It Happened Close to Your House), which derives from the former title of the local daily news report in Belgian newspaper Le Soir.[citation needed] In the film, a crew of filmmakers follow a serial killer, recording his crimes and grotesquely candid commentary for a documentary they are producing. At first dispassionate observers, they find themselves caught up in the increasingly chaotic violence. The film is shot in black and white and was produced on a shoe-string budget by four student filmmakers, led by director Rémy Belvaux. The genesis of the idea came from shooting a documentary without any money. As the filming went on, the students were able to garner more support and ultimately find a distributor. [wikipedia]
