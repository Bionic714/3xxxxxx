Erika Andersen We?ve all seen it: a successful employee promoted to manager is given no training and essentially pushed into the deep end and told to swim? According to Andersen, this approach to creating new managers is epidemic. Using an accessible gardening metaphor, Andersen, founder of Proteus International, contends that new managers must have a support system available to train them, while on the job, to become successful managers.

-LEGAL TORRENTS

Purpose:

create a balance, share the already free stuff,
public domain works, freeware, free music,
free ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.

show the copyright owners that torrent
websites shouldn't bear the responsibility
of what their users upload, torrent websites
are very much similar to google..

users upload what they want to upload,
download what they want to download,
and search for what they want to search..

by creating this balance and sharing the already free
stuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..
