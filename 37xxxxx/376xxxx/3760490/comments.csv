,cobol99,2007-08-31T18:50Z,Dont download this junk. The CRACK replaces DAP.EXE with trojan BLOODHOUND.OVERPACKED. I got warning from Norton antivirus.
,GuepardoMX,2007-09-04T08:42Z,"Ja! Norton is worse Antivirus of the market. You must use NOD32 or Kaspersky. This it is a false positive that very few antivirus detects. I have installed this version of DAP 7,2 + Patch and I do not have any problem. Greetings to all!"
