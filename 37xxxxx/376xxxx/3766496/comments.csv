,bonfrago,2009-05-31T23:01Z,I've DL'ed this twice and the voice/dialogue track does not play using VLC or Quicktime. The soundtrack plays correctly but no voices. Even the subtitles work... This is the first time this has happened to me. I'd appreciate any help... I love this film and would very much like to see it again. Thanks
,bonfrago,2009-05-31T23:11Z,"Tried the reverse stereo under audio channels and found the voice track, but about 3x slower than the film speed, when I increase the playback the vocals become more or less clear... any suggestions?"

This is my all-time favorite movie. Please someone fix this problem. :-("

voice + background audio is normal and in sync.
I use kmplayer for windows, it is better than vlc."
