Plot: 'The Razor's Edge' Bill Murray ('Groundhog Day') makes an unforgettable dramatic debut as Larry Darrell, the free-spirited seeker, in this gripping adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's classic novel. When Larry returns from World War I disillusioned with Jazz Age values, he undertakes a quest which leads him to reject his rich fiancee (Catherine Hicks, TV's '7th Heaven') and his superficial lifestyle to go search for truth in the Himalayas. But Larry learns that the path to enlightenment is as difficult as treading "the sharp edge of a razor" and returns to civilization, where he tastes life's dark side when he tries to save a hometown girl turned prostitute (Theresa Russell, 'Wild Things').
