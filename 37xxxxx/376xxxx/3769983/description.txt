    I used DVD-Decrypter 3.5.4.0 to make an iso file with MDS.


    The MDS is required if doing a DVD9 to DVD9 copy using DVD+R DL media,

    as it stores the layer break data needed for burning the new copy.

    Select the MDS-file when burning to a DVD9 disc.

    I recommend to use DVD Decrypter with slow burning speed.  



    I have turned on super-seeding.  So if you do not share, the download
         
    Will be very slow.  Please help your pirate friends.



    I only have 1 Mbit/s up so please help me seed this big baby
