,Captain_Janeway,2007-08-18T22:10Z,He will. :)
,eb#1,2007-08-21T08:20Z,"Ok, I have finished my 20x ratio now and will quit seeding this. Seems like everyone did that long ago, most people probably with a 0,000020 ratio :-/

But it was great to get these, thanks again wormman! :-)"

[T],wormman,2007-09-25T23:14Z,There is no season 4.
,amss1976,2007-09-29T12:48Z,Sorry for that silly mistake. Will you be posting in DVD9 The Next Generation?
,amss1976,2007-09-29T12:50Z,"I ask this because your post was the only one that had Portuguese subtitles, and it is only in those that I can find them because eveybody takes Portuguese subtitles away... :(

Tyvm again..."
,vkp1970,2007-10-08T09:35Z,"Hi wormman! Thanks for all the good you have uploaded and it's much appreciated! :-)

But I'm here to make a small plea... I see you were 'qassa' earlier. If you still have the movie 'Fort Apache' would you consider seeding it some again? We're some who has been stuck at 94,1% for some weeks now...

Thanks in advance! :-)"
[T],wormman,2007-10-09T17:08Z,Sorry  i don't have fort apachw any more.
