Synd att du inte har några justa seedare. 25 st som bara chappat - dåligt!! (om nu det ovan stämmer...)"
,barreman,2007-08-03T13:58Z,"I'll seed until there is enough other seeders, don't worry :)"

,dibrivan,2007-08-07T10:31Z,tackar vet någon var man kan få tag i covers till denna film?
,barreman,2007-08-07T22:31Z,Is there no seeder(s) at the point of 10th august i'll stop seed completely and the torrent dies. Why even bother putting up something for a community who only takes and does not share jack squat?

,barreman,2007-08-29T19:20Z,"It's a pretty good DVD, dunno the votes @ imdb (3,7), many seem not to like this ""movie"". But after watching this with my kid I thought it was good, not bad at all. :) Trying to give something back to the community, feels better for myself than just taking :)"
,Mouchi,2007-09-05T17:17Z,"Just one simple question.
I've downloaded this movie during the weekend, and then I tried to burn it with Nero. But than it says on my dvd-player that this type of film can't be played..?

I guess it has something to do with the .iso file, any idea how you could burn it so it works on the dvd player? All other file works. :s"
,barreman,2007-09-07T18:51Z,"its a direct copy of the DVD so.. should work, or i know it works. Burn it with Alcohol or some other program if its causing problems."
,biffen669,2008-03-22T00:16Z,Biffen669- Thanx man! But I have the same problem. It doesn´t work at my dvd. layer usually play everything (almost). But the movie work perfectly with my pc and IVIVO-media player. Kind of strange huh?
