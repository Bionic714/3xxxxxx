I concur! There is no such thing as a 'law' of attraction. It is a theory until proven otherwise.

""The evidence provided is usually anecdotal and, because of the self-selecting nature of positive reports, as well as the subjective nature of any results, highly susceptible to misinterpretations like confirmation bias and selection bias.[8] References to modern scientific theory are also criticized. While brainwaves do have an electrical signal, quantum physic principles do not act in the way proponents of the Law of Attraction have described them.[5]""
