,r.oui,2007-08-06T03:19Z,It isn't my rip but i downloaded yesterday and quality is really good. 
,cragllo,2007-08-06T04:16Z,"Judging by all the other 'supposed' DVDRips this is probably the same as the Ch4OTIC torrent...
just an R5 release badly re-encoded."
,djbigjohn,2007-08-06T05:04Z,"Yes it may look good but dose the sound have BASS???? - Turn it up, if if it sounds thin it's no good to me."
,fottotopa,2007-08-06T14:42Z,"EXCELENT! Very good rip, thank u! V9.5 / A9"
,guljfesk,2007-08-06T15:41Z,"People just, wont get it..

ooohh.. the Picture is good.. its a DVDrip.
but, what about the sound..  a right. dosnt mather they use headphones, what about us who cares about the movie?

sounds is like 70% of the life in a movie. good sound efects are beather then a great movie with no sound!"
,kongdvd,2007-08-06T17:42Z,"This may be good to watch on your laptop with tiny speakers or headphones, but try using a 100 inch projector and a real sound system - this quality just does not cut it. Compared to a real DVDrip (where V=10 and A=10) this is like V=7 and A=5. Absolutely lousy tiny screaming audio. Like guljfesk says, people just don't get it. "
[M],Lollash,2007-08-07T00:25Z,"there is a dvd-screener release, uploaded by a TPB admin.  and yes, its dvd Quality and not a fucking cam.
