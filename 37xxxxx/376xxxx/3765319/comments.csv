,jellyjensen,2007-08-22T11:00Z,"Doesn't this product have an activation step? Without completing the activation, I believe you can only run the program 5 times before it refuses to start up. Has anyone tried it long enough to be sure this doesn't happen with this torrent?"

I was wondering if you could help me? I downloaded this program and followed the instructions and after I entered the serial and it installed for a minute than it reports that there is a missing file, is there a solution?

Thanks"
,Destruckdoz,2007-09-22T02:58Z,"Well, if anybody else had the same problem, this is what I did which worked: I downloaded the french naturallyspeaking here on piratebay and just added in the missing files that the install will prompt you to and it will go through smoothly. 

Hope that helps."

i get passed everything, adding the key, and it goes to the installation process, but after, when it's copying the files, it asks me to add in Disc #2.. i opened the .daa file with the Disc 2 on it and burned it on a different dvd and put it in, but it doesnt want to see it :(

,noobpro,2007-12-03T22:44Z,"Alexander, 

I burned disc 1, disconnected from internet, ran DNS9Sp1.exe, but the message ""this utility cannot find a naturallyspeaking product to patch."" Do you know how I can fix this? What does mounting mean? Perhaps I could try that method   "
,noobpro,2007-12-03T22:55Z,"to be more specific, I burned disc 1, selected it, but the message ""an install-on-demand component is required for this operation. do you want to continue with this operation?"" I clicked ""install"" (other option was cancel), but it took me to the same burning program that I used to burn the disc...the disc file is ISO if that helps...thanks"
,noobpro,2007-12-04T17:42Z,"UPDATE: now I'm having the same problem that Destruckdoz had. I did what they did and downloaded the french version to add in missing winrar files. So close, but I'm still missing a cconly folder (eng>lm>dns>general>cconly) contained in ENGGen~1.cab file. could someone please send this missing file to my email terrytran_3@hotmail.com or provide a link? thanks"
,ilive4harleys,2007-12-07T19:38Z,"I just started the download and so far I am getting good speeds. i do not know how much it will complete or if the speed will stay fast or whatever but for all you children, stop flaming the OP. I do not see you posting anything. He did not have to post this. It was very kind of him to do so in the first place. If you are having trouble, post the problem and I am sure someone can help you. This is why so many refuse to upload. Because they take the time and bandwidth, and not all are as lucky as I and others and have unlimited up and/or down bandwidth, and post apps or videos or music or whatever and their thanx are assholes like you calling them names and insulting them. Keep your comments to yourself and if you do not like it then just do not download it. Go out and buy the app instead of downloading it and saving over $100+.
Thank you for the upload Alexander15. Do NOT listen to these putz' and just remember there are many of us who are adult and very appreciative. Email at iliveforharleys@yahoo.com. Feel free to email me Alex anytime so I can thank you personally."

,alexander15,2007-12-27T06:28Z,wow ilive4harleys that was the best comment ever thx
,Karnith,2008-01-04T03:22Z,"try this

If you want all languages you will have to use CD2 also.
CD2 ONLY contains the language .CAB files.

If US English is the only language you want, just
choose ""Custom Install"" and then de-select the
languages you do not want on HDD.
That way you will not be prompted for missing files or to use CD2."

,Jonbenet,2008-08-09T19:06Z,"Thanks for the up alexander15, but the product only works 5 times unless you're able to complete activation.  As others have stated, Nuance has already iced that serial number so unless there's some way around the activation, I think the rest of us are screwed.

This damn product also installs that most hated piece of crapware ever invented: The Installshield Program Updater!  If you have a program updates icon in your control panel, have fun getting rid of it.  Not impossible, and NOT alexander's fault, just a pain."
,strobowash,2008-08-20T17:46Z,Does other language available in the second CD? (I need italian)
,willywoo2,2008-08-24T02:01Z, Thanx
,walled,2008-08-27T01:16Z,"This works perfectly. I did exactly what the uploader had in the ""read me"" file and a few minutes later I had this program up and running flawlessly. I just have to get used to it now, but it is a bit inefficient at typing up something for me. For now, it's faster if I just type a doc manually than use this because it's quick to error, but it'll learn and I will too.

Thanks for sharing a great program."
,orlandomek,2008-08-29T23:42Z,"after downloading dragon naturally speaking I've tryed to install it wth the installshield wizard and after preparing for the setup it forces you to check on update, after a wile  I got the msg ""this tool didn't find no dragon naturally speaking product to update""
please guys some body giveme a hint,  is the second time a downlod the program from alexander15 tnks."
,jalukasim,2008-09-01T21:18Z,"Thanks alexander15 this program works just fine .For those people having trouble installing this do a custom install in which case you only need cd1, Another way (but I have not tried it yet) is to extract all the files to one folder and install from there"
,casius88,2008-09-11T09:46Z,"For those who get get the ""this utility cannot find a naturallyspeaking product to patch."" error, you need to mount the files first or burn them to a cd.  If you don't know how to mount then check out this link: http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/620/xp_small_free_way_to_use_and_mount_images_iso_files_without_burning_them

My problem is after I've installed the program it say I can only use it 5 times before I need to activate it.  After opening and closing it 5 times the program won't load until you click the activate button at which point it requires a new product key.  Anybody find a way around this?"
,hapozamani,2008-12-20T16:32Z,"major props to alexander15. this program works awesome!
to those having difficulty. make sure you know how to mount iso files. easy to find info on the net.

,superhero7,2009-04-10T17:39Z,"Hey guys the dowload took me awhile but it finally arrived.  I should have read the comments though because now I see that this is only compatible with Windows XP, or 2003 server.  It is not I repeat IS NOT compatible with Windows Vista.  Unless some genius knows how to use it on Vista (Which of course I would be greatly appreciative if you could show me how by emailing me) and or convert it somehow I'll just have to wait until the version 10 download gets finished.  I also heard Vers. 9 is better somehow than Vers. 10 any comments email me @ gonetodocs@gmail.com

Thanks Alex for an awesome upload!  It looks really clean and I am not considered a newbie.  You might want to mention in the description text that it is not compatible with Windows Vista.  

As well if anyone could let me know if version 10 has that issue with the Installshield Wizard update and any way to get around it I would appreciate that in advance as well.   

BTW Alex, These guys dissin you are only pissed off @ themselves because they just haven't taken the time to fully research the downloads and follow the directions.  If I read you correclty this was your first upload and I would be proud of this work.  

Have a great day and keep uploading good clean quality stuff.  Thanks again and much appreciated."
