,curiousman2050,2007-08-10T23:41Z,"would be nice if someone would seed this, its stuck at 45% it says that there is one seeder yet the file is not moving"
,MystikIncarnate,2007-08-12T22:32Z,why is this an MPG file?
,ljpedaah,2007-08-13T08:50Z,"As everyone prior to me have said. Please, please seed. Been stuck on 44,9% for ages, and I would really like to see this movie. And also like MystikIncarnate said: Why is this a Mpg file????"
,MystikIncarnate,2007-08-16T03:18Z,"considering it downloads to a folder called ""torrent"" and it's a ""dvdrip"" in MPG format, i'm somehow thinking that the poster is a bit of a noob."
,RacerDemon,2007-08-27T10:24Z,"i dont know what happened, i was uploading, went to bed, woke up, and the file is gone, and it's gone from my hard drive..."
