Plot: Perhaps the most compelling picture ever made about the shattering aftermath of the Vietnam War, 'Coming Home' earned eight Academy Award┬« nominations and three Oscars┬«: Best Actress (Jane Fonda), Best Actor (Jon Voight) and Best Screenplay. Hailed by critics as "dazzling" (Rex Reed), "gripping" (Leonard Martin) and "unforgettable" (Judith Crist), it is a heart- rending examination of a critical period in our nation's history and "an uncompromising, extraordinarily moving film" (Roger Ebert)

When Marine Captain Bob Hyde (Bruce Dern) leaves for Vietnam, his wife Sally (Fonda) volunteers at a local hospital. There she meets Luke Martin (Voight), a former sergeant whose war injury has left him a paraplegic. Embittered with rage and filled with frustration, Luke finds new hope and confidence through his growing intimacy with Sally. The relationship transforms Sally's feeling about life, love and the horrors of war. And when, wounded and disillusioned, Sally's husband returns home, all three must grapple with the full impact of a brutal , distant war that has changed their lives forever.
