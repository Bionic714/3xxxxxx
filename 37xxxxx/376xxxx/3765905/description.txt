Young flatmates Chrissy and Jo find a stranger called Robin asleep in their bath after a party. He moves in permanently on a platonic basis. Robin is a student chef who spends much of the time trying to seduce Chrissy and flirting with Jo. Although the women have no romantic interest and spurn his mild advances, they quickly adapt to his presence in the flat, although they only got permission from the landlord when they told him Robin was gay. The last words in the first episode (spoken by Chrissy) were "We told him you were a poof."

The landlord, in truth a sub-letting landlord placed by the council, is George Roper, a bumbling, accident-prone and gullible man under the thumb of his domineering and sexually frustrated wife Mildred, whose way of making up for her husband's inadequacy as landlord and lover is to make suggestive remarks to Robin and frequently side with her tenants against George. That said, for all their battles, the Ropers are a devoted couple. After the first series Robin's friend Larry, a lovable rogue, moves into the loft apartment and is a frequent source of trouble. Another occasional cast member is dodgy builder and schemer Jerry.
