And the fact that this is your first and only release dont make me doubt any less. :)"
,fordred,2007-08-07T15:38Z,This is the same as the R5 that was released earlier
,hungaryboy,2007-08-07T16:17Z,Thank you very much. This rip is perfect. Video is really very clean and nice and sound stereo brilliant. My rate is v9.5/a9.5
,blomman333,2007-08-07T16:35Z,how lovely! now i will download it and perhaps my rate will be 9.7 or even 9.8 wich then would be a new worldrecord! last year a kid in uganda rated pearl harbor dvdrip 9.7 and an old man in russia rated alien ressurection 9.7!
