DEAR MUSIC LOVERS,

This mixed music cd is one of my MIXAMIX series.
This cds are made mainly as road music but some of them can be easily used for parties.
I make this cds to accompany me and my friends at car or excursions.

The motive for making these cds was the fact that I could not find a radio station 
playing the music I like without interuptions. So I started making my 1hour and a half music experience.
I like various kinds of music and like to hear them intermixed. That is a risk no radio station takes and also not many djs in the world. 
Till now only Paul Oakenfold , Daniel Davoli and a few more 
have managed to marry many kinds and ages of music together.

Anyways, hope you enjoy this mixed disks as much as I do.
Remember that I am not professional, I do this as a hobby.
The date after MIXAMIX is the date I have started creating each of this cds. 
The creation may take from just one day to many months.

A few words about MIXAMIX 20070727

	Dear friends. At last it's time for my summer vacations! I am leaving for
	the beautiful Chalkidiki in Greek Macedonia to spend some days as close by the sea as possible.
	The journey takes more than 6 hours so I sould create something new for accompany these long hours on the wheel.
	Also my friens also were waiting for something new to hear from me so they gave me a great motive!
	So here it is my new mix. New not only as a collection but as a technic since I am using new soft
	with lots of Console FXse! You will hear lots of songs intermixing giving to them a brand new sound.
	Many new deliveries in this mix including Wolfsheim, Mikro, Chicane, Tiga , Mylo , Armin and more great summer hits!
	
	I hope you will enjoy it as much as all my other mixes! Have some great summer vacations! 
	See you on September with new mix with fresh ideas.
	 Till then,
	Keep sharing music and have fun!
