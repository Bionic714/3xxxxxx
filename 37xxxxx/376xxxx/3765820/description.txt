Once there, Homer heads downtown to get the car while the others check out the sites. Homer finds that his car has been fitted with a boot by the police, who have also papered his windshield with piles of parking tickets. Enraged when he misses his chance to talk with the cop responsible for the boot, Homer drives off with the thing still stuck on his car, tearing up the pavement all along Broadway. Homer uses a pile driver to break the boot, but winds up breaking much of his car in the process.

It turns out that the Skinner who\'s lived in Springfield all these years is really named Armin Tamzarian, and met the real Seymour Skinner in Vietnam. The real Skinner was a highly decorated Sergeant, while Tamzarian was a fifties-style greaser and juvenile delinquent. The real Skinner was captured by the enemy, held in a POW camp for five years and then sold to China as a slave forced to make sneakers in Wuhan. Tamzarian stole his name and identity, moved to Springfield and took over Skinner\'s former life, even claiming the man\'s mother, Agnes, to be his own. With the real Skinner back, the fake Skinner quits his job at the school, moves out of his mother\'s house and starts a new life as a loser in Capital City. Meanwhile, the real Skinner takes over at Springfield Elementary School and proves to be much less bearable than the old Skinner. In desperation, Agnes Skinner, Mrs. Krabappel and the Simpsons travel to Capital City to beg Tamzarian to come back.

Three new yucky Halloween yarns from your favorite yellow family. First, Homer seems to be the only survivor of a nuclear explosion. As the last living person on earth--literally, the Homega Man--Homer is free to do whatever he wants, specifically steal cars and crash them and dance naked in the Springfield Community Church. But Homer\'s revelry is cut short by a band of angry, flesh-eating mutants who survived the blast and are now hungry for Homer. Speeding in a car to Evergreen Terrace, Homer hides in his old home and discovers that his family has also survived the blast, protected by the layers and layers of lead paint in the house. Marge and kids are elated to see Homer and it\'s their pleasure to use their shotguns to blast holes in the mutants. In the second story, Homer buys a matter-transporting machine from Professor Frink\'s yard sale. He uses it to grab beers from the fridge without getting up from the couch and to quickly go to the bathroom while watching TV. When Bart goes inside the machine with a fly, his DNA is scrambled with the insect\'s and two new creatures emerge: A tiny fly with Bart\'s head, and Bart\'s body with a disgusting fly\'s head. The family accepts the new bugged-out Bart, but when the tiny Bart tires of being a fly, it\'s up to Lisa to trick the big Bart back into the machine so each pest\'s DNA can be put back in the correct place. The final sequence is the story of a coven of Springfield witches from 1649. As played by Marge and her sisters Patty and Selma, the witches are kindly old souls who occasionally enjoy eating children from the town. To stop the witches from eating their kids, the townspeople offer them candy and treats instead, thus initating the tradition of Halloween.

Homer steals the angel and sells tickets for people to visit it in his garage while Lisa chips off a tiny piece of bone and brings it to Harvard Professor Stephen Jay Gould for examination. The tests are inconclusive, but Lisa is still convinced that the skeleton is not an angel\'s. When the angel disappears from Homer\'s garage and reappears on a hill over Springfield with the words \"The End Will Come at Sundown\" chiseled into its base, everyone is convinced that it\'s a sign from God. The entire town gathers on the hill to witness \"the end,\" but Lisa remains skeptical. When the angel begins to speak, everyone--including Lisa--shudders in awe. That awe soon disappears when it is revealed that the \"angel\" is merely a promotional stunt for the Heavenly Hills Mall, a new shopping center.

==========================

how to burn with imgburn

Yes! You can use ImgBurn to burn this too!
Put in a empty DVD and open Imgburn, when it
has found the DVD go to MODE and click at BUILD!
Then browse at the folder where the files are, that\'s all to it! I use it for all VIDEO_TS and Image files!
