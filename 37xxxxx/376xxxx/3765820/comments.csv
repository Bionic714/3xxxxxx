its a pain in the ass to extract the chapters... why dont you just upload em in avi? ""

this is a DVD, for DVD players. why would i upload avi into the DVD section? and why are you extract anything, just burn it to a DVD. this is why i upload all my DVDs to ""Movies DVDR"" section and not the ""TV SHOW"" section, because i would get endless questions about why this is not in avi format. if you are looking for avi this is not for you."
,newt78,2007-08-28T10:18Z,"deathmule, your tv shows, do they have a menu on them? and will you be making available season 3 of prison break? thanks. Newt78"

,newt78,2007-08-28T18:03Z,"might i make a request if possible, i know you do individual episodes might it possible for you to upload one that has 4 episodes at a time i.e 1-4, 5-8, 9-12 etc? or is that too much? i would be extremely grateful if you could or am i asking to much. i will be downloading all 3 of them shows you mentioned. another you might consider is the 4400. thats very good also. many thanks.

like i said, this is not for you, if you wanted avi. would you go into one of the movies in the ""Movies DVDR"" section, and say ""why didnt you make this avi?"" no you wouldnt, so why would you do it here? i thought i made this clear when i posted it in the Movie DVDR section."
,ylastoftw,2007-09-09T10:30Z,"Thank you very much Deathmule, Though the menu is made up, you include ALL The Episodes from season 9

Thank you :)"
,Dagor_88,2007-09-23T18:32Z,So how's the quality? I guess I'll just find out...
,harlay,2007-09-27T13:50Z,Ahhh simpsons
,tavisjohn,2007-09-28T05:07Z,"If this is a DVD, then why is it in the TVSHOW section?  DVD's go in the DVD section.

I hate ""Whole Season"" DVD's!  They have crappy video quality!  I prever XVID or DIVX AVI files.  A whole season fit's onto 1 or 2 4.5 gig DVD's.  And you get EXELENT video quality!

With soo many DVD players supporting XVID and DIVX there is no reason to super compress these into a 4.5gig video DVD."
[T],deathmule,2007-10-01T20:20Z,"""If this is a DVD, then why is it in the TVSHOW section? DVD's go in the DVD section.""

dont ask me why this is in the TVshows section. i uploaded this (and all my DVDs) to DVD movie section, because this is a DVD. i gest someone at thepiratebay moved them here. so i gest i will be uploading them here for now on

your right alot of DVD players support XVID and DIVX, but they dont have menus and if the name of the DIVX is long it wont show what episode your on. DVD players that support DIVX XVID skip alot (witch you wont get with DVD format)  as for quality this is a cartoon, quality souldnt be that big of a deal (quality is good for 20 something episodes). i wouldnt make a lost DVD like this, just the simpsons (cartoon)
