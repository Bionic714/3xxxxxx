,the_haole,2008-05-13T15:32Z,Whoever SCOTCH is they should learn how to .rar.& .zip files correclty and include all the files before creating torrents. None of SCOTCH programs work. Simply useless!!!
,the_haole,2008-05-13T18:49Z,I stand corrected about SCOTCH. It appears SCOTCH is not the problem but the jerk-off repacking the original torrent files without knowing what the hell their doing.
,Kagan1,2008-09-25T05:26Z,I have downloaded this 5 different times and each time the only one that works is number 1.   I get a corrupted file message for the rest.   Anyone have a working copy of all five.   Thanks for the first one btw!
,Acciel,2008-10-10T14:11Z,This is the second onOne Photoframe 3 I have downloaded here and evidently none of them actually come with the frames. Is there some reason why you would torrent software for frames and then not include them?
