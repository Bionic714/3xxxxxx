,oldpatriot,2008-06-22T14:19Z,How do I get that other language off of the movie?  Every time I run it I get this bleeding over - voice-over sound file.  It sucks!!!
,Joe6pack,2008-10-08T18:24Z,Don't bother!! You are forced to listen to directors commentary. I wouldn't mind if you had a choice.
,Numskull808,2009-01-12T03:16Z,you can choose your audio tracks.

,PenniesOS,2009-08-07T08:50Z,"@ anyone trying to play this without the commentry

What I would suggest doing is Googling for a program called VirtualDub and then reading up on how to make a direct-stream copy of the film using only one audio track.

I've had several films that I got from Russian torrent trackers that had dual-audio and with which I was able to remove via VirtualDub. 

Thanks for the share Terabye! Bloody great little film."
