This is a soundboard bootleg I found on archive.org. I split the tracks up in audacity and tagged them appropriately.

There are a few glitches (which occurred with the source), but the set is DEFINITELY worth listening to.

The live versions of 'Sister', 'Chicago' and 'Super Sexy Woman' are EPIC.

Includes stories & dialog by Sufjan between songs.
