About the author:
For nine years I worked at Microsoft in various different roles: primarily as a program manager for Internet Explorer (v1 -> v5.0). I also had long stints as a usability engineer, lead program manager, and for a time, UI design evangelist. September 12th, 2003 was my last day at MSFT ? I now work full time writing, teaching and consulting. Contact me if you want to hire to me to speak at an event, consult with your organization, or teach your team something. Or just say ?Hi, I like your stuff; ? keep it up.?

-LEGAL TORRENTS

Purpose:

create a balance, share the already free stuff,
public domain works, freeware, free music,
free ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.

show the copyright owners that torrent
websites shouldn't bear the responsibility
of what their users upload, torrent websites
are very much similar to google..

users upload what they want to upload,
download what they want to download,
and search for what they want to search..

by creating this balance and sharing the already free
stuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..
