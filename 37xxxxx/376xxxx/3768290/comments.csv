,netbanking,2007-08-11T18:17Z,"Hello everybody! I am a bit worried about using public serial for Apple softwares. Can anynone tell me whether there are risks or not? I mean: through the update-process,for instance; is there any risks that Apple forces me to buy the software or sue me?
Thanks anyway"
,sdotbailey,2007-08-12T06:38Z,"well, I did it with iWork 06 last year when I got my mac and never had any problems with it. I don't know that you'd need to be worried so go ahead and use it man. OM617 in his own way told you that basically, you're good to go. Enjoy, it works."
,sdotbailey,2007-08-12T06:38Z,"oh, and thanks a whole hell of a lot to the person that provided it. "

,tkel8,2008-10-07T22:32Z,"hi everyone, i registered the program to apple by mistake. could someone pleeease tell me if this is a big no no??

thanks"
,eddst0ne,2008-10-18T22:40Z,"just so you all know;
YES. apple DOES know what serial key you use.
the most sensible thing to do is use a FAKE NAME and EMAIL ADDRESS, this minimizes the possibility of them contacting you.

HOWEVER; if they really want to contact you they more than definitely are getting sent some extra information along with the names and emails you provide, so i'm sure it's easy enough for them to contact you if they need to.

(note: this is probably through the registration info when you first got the mac, and the workstation id sent with the data when you register iWork)

hope i've kinda, helped. :)"
