,pootman,2008-02-28T11:45Z,"This torrent appears to be a broken version of the torrent here:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3771154/Chris_Moyles_Parodies
The files are almost identical(99.8%), but there are no seeds on this one. I have copied the files across to seed the 99.8 that's available - the only incomplete files are 'Baked Beans.mp3' (3.17 available of 3.28MB) and 'AntEater.mp3' (2.86 available of 3.00MB).
If you stop this torrent, but keep the folder and files. Then start the other torrent, but point the download directory to the folder from this torrent, and you'll be able to complete the last two files.

ps Many thanks SamMckey. My wife will love this. "
