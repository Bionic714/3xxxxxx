Movie Details

Nora Wilder is a thirty-something Manhattanite who is cynical about love and relationships. Nora plugs away at her job in a posh downtown hotel and can't help but wonder what it is she has to do to find a relationship as ideal as her friend Audrey's "perfect marriage." It doesn√¢??t help that her overbearing mother takes every opportunity to remind Nora that she's still unattached. After a series of disastrous first dates, she meets Julien, a seemingly devil-may-care Frenchman with a passion for living. Expecting another disastrous ending, Nora tries to avoid making the same mistakes. She finds herself in Paris looking to break old patterns. Inevitably, Nora has to look inward before she can find a new outlook on life and most importantly, love.
