Rocco DiSpirito is a douche. Oh yes it's true. He sucks so bad he can't even judge food in a quickfire or a real competition. They gave him frozen food for crying out loud.

And yes this is listed as episode 7, as it's the 7th episode to air on Bravo, with the 6th being the Watch What Happens special that was almost like a reunion but featured all three seasons.
