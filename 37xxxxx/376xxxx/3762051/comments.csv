,jabijabo,2009-05-05T03:11Z,"It is a Real Video 4. VLC plays it. (MPC probably could with a few tweaks). Who's the ass who encoded this?!? By the way, mkv is not a format but a container that can encapsualte video files + sound files + subtitles files and more in just one file. So there is NO codec for mkv but codecs for the video file inside. And here it is a real video 4. Laetitia was a big French amateur producer in the 80s. What happened to her?"
