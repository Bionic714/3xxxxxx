You can't be serious; if he doesn't seed this and inform more people more people will die when the world ends; they would not be informed on how to deal with thiis."

These happen to be the same corporations that work so hard to misinform people about peak oil, sprawl, and all the other crucial issues in your films.

You guys aren't a big rich corporation, but since you're movie makers, I want to ask that you  please do what you can to support (and take advantage of) alternative models of cultural production and distribution. It is the wrong direction to tell people who share movies that they do not care about independent filmmakers."
