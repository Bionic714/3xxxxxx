Visual Task Tips is a small program which replaces what you see when you put your mouse over a program in the taskbar. Instead of seeing text, you'll see a thumbnail picture of the program, even before you do anything! This does not hog up cpu or ram like the one vista has. Available for xp and Vista home Basic (Since home basic vista doesn't have this feature) 

Just unzip and install. 

Please enjoy and comment! :)
