Film adaptation of George Orwell's novel, an allegory of Russian Communism. The animal inhibitants of an English farm, spurred on by dreams of dominating the earth and ruling together and equally, take over, and at first all is well. But then Napolean the pig decides he wants a little more power. He ousts his opponent, Snowball, and turns the farm into a corrupt society, assuring the animals that everything is fine, when in fact that is most certainly not true.
