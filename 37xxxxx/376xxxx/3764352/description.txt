I don't have a scanner, so this was all done manually and with some time. Most of everything in the booklet is transcribed here (Libretto, credits, cast, synopsis - no pictures). I'll apologize in advance if anyone discovers errors in it (though I honestly tried to correct the errors that were found in the CD booklet - of course, there's a lot of stuff to rifle through and I could have missed some things).


This booklet is included with this 3 CD set:

You can also use it with the OBC recording (it's interesting to see what parts were cut and how much of the story is lost); which can be found here:

Enjoy!
