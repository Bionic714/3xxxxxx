,far_isle,2008-04-30T02:49Z,"This queue gen flashes and Stopzilla deletes it as a Zxxx adware. 

No one seems to have a real number or keygen anywhere - Danell - can you help?  It would be great to test this program to see if it is not too tough to use - before paying $650! and discovering you can't use it."
,far_isle,2008-04-30T17:06Z,"should have typed KEY gen, sorry.  Guess I have that 32GB queue/dl on my mind.

Tried to search for a new reg. code, serial, key gen or crack - nothing so far.  HELP!

:)"
,Danell,2008-07-20T16:54Z,"far_isle: what the hell is Stopzilla o.O
There are NOTHING wrong with the keygen. I have used it a lot of times like thousen of other from the tracker where i got all this shit xD"
,useruser0101,2008-08-16T19:07Z,hey when I go to register it says the hardware fingerprint has changed since I sent system ID... anyone else had this problem or have suggestions of how to resolve? cheers and will be seeding for long time!
,far_isle1,2008-08-17T18:13Z,"OK - followed the install - the keygen doesn't provide a serial number and doesn't unlock the program for me.  I have tried to install multiple times, clicked the Keygen - it flashes, vanishes, and nothing changes except AVG and my Malware Proggie detect Zxxx and wish to remove it.  I shut them off, try the process again - the Keygen blinks for 1/2 a second, vanishes - no serial code.  Can someone please just post a working serial number so we don't have to go through this - for those of us that can't register the program? Appreciate all the hard word you are doing but without the serial (and the keygen not working for me) I am quite stuck.  Thnx for your patience and all help."
,far_isle1,2008-08-17T18:27Z,"Success!  I just clicked the Keygen about 8 times until it held on my screen.  Typed in the code - generated a system ID - copied it - generated an Authorization Key and clicked Complete.  Wow - longer process - did work, just was unable to see the Keygen Code long enough to grab it, but it is done - yes it works.  Thanks so much, and sorry for the messages.  I can see now why it is not easy to copy the serial."
,Sessilenomad,2009-01-28T02:51Z,seed this when done ppl please
,jonenant,2009-02-16T17:02Z,"ERROR ID 5: HARDWEAR FINGERPRINT

When I try to register whit keygen. Does someone hav any solution for this problem?"
,tggrng123,2009-07-08T05:54Z,"Seed please. :) 
Thanks for the upload!"
,jd800,2009-07-12T19:20Z,thanks its perfect
,tggrng123,2009-07-15T16:41Z,THANK YOU!!!!! definitely sedding this!
,stemfromseeds,2009-11-02T01:58Z,"My virus protection deletes the keygen But I disabled my protection until installation was 100%complete.Sucsess.
As soon as I enabled my protection it deletes the keygen even if stored on external hard disc..That maybe the reason for the lack of seeders. 
My problem is that colossus can not locate the samples from the library on my external hard drive..So it does not work for me yet..Any advice on proper placement of nks files and etc will be greatly appreciated.obviously The read me txt is not clear enough for me to follow through with.Thanks"
,anonymousbosh,2009-11-15T18:19Z,"is anyone naive enough to believe that what antivirus software detects as threats in these keygens is a ""false-positive""? really?

's'kinda very unlikely, isn't it, given the great demand for expensive software made free, and the money that can be made stealing system resources? so, do you really think those devoting their skills toward cracking this shit do it out of the good of their heart?"
,bladblah1,2010-07-03T06:37Z,hey danell-- awesome seed. but your install keygen is infected with a trojan virus....anyone reseed a non-infected keygen??
