,StingZ,2007-08-31T19:02Z,"This one looks a bit screwy too. An update viewer? What the hell? Every NOD32 AV I've come across looks like a virus. (I've downloaded one and it was a virus- You know who you are.) This one is significantly bigger in size (8MB bigger) than the one I downloaded.. But then again - It contains four files... when you only need two - The crack, and the installer file.. Oh well, fuck NOD32, People in NZ use it alot - Which makes me wonder about the people that upload these with viruses in them - Are they NZers and just pissed because we aren't a third world country? :\"
