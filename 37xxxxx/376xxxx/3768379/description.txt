Compilation Track Information







All tracks within this collection have been obtained from sources inside and outside of the internet (i cannot specify which individual tracks as that would take too long).
I mention this because i cannot guarantee 100% that all of the tracks in this collection have been ripped from an original Compact Disc source (i.e. "transcoded") but
to the best of my knowledge these tracks are of the best lossless quality i could find !!!!!!!!!
