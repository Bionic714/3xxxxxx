Plot: Written by Alan Bennett from his stage play and featuring "a towering performance by Nigel Hawthorne, and a stunning screen directorial debut" ('Variety') by Tony Award winner Nicholas Hytner, this Academy Award┬½-winning masterpiece of royal intrigue is "potent, engrossing and thrilling" ('Los Angeles Times').

Just five years after losing the "rebellious colonies," it appears that England's King George III (Hawthorne) is now losing his mind! Suddenly, the stately monarch is hallucinating, shouting obscenities, behaving lewdly towards the Queen's (Helen Mirren) comely lady-in-waiting (Amanda Donohoe), and generally becoming a candidate for the lunatic asylum. The palace doctors are baffled, but the Prince of Wales (Rupert Everett), tired of playing the waiting game conspires to take advantage of the situation. Will the King's supporters be able to restore their monarch's wits before he's stripped of his throne?
