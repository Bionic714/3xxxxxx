,bethmattsix33,2007-08-15T18:06Z,"This is the book that opens up the doors to understanding the Golden Dawn,Crowley, Kabbalah,and so much more. I recommend it to anyone who is just starting and really wants to make a go of it. It will save you a lot of time and energy and will help steer you in the right direction.Which is to say it will steer you away from the wrong direction. This is for the serious student not a greeting card style spell book. It has theory and practice. Great upload its a magickal act that this book is available. Good job I appreciate your efforts scanning and uploading a great book. I get something new out of it each time I read it. Thank you. Thank you. I hope you do Modern Sex Magick too. 93 ;)"
,tomtomx,2007-08-15T22:59Z,"Anybody who uses the words Golden Dawn, Crowley, magic, old gods in the same sentences as Kabbalah clearly never understod what kabbalah is about... (No sarcasm or hostility intended, just a hint.)
Read more at www.kabbalah.info."
[T],occultmobilization,2007-08-19T08:32Z,"Actually, tomtomx, that totally depends on whether you study Jewish or Hermetic Kabbalah.  In the case of Hermetic Kabbalah, yes, it makes perfect sense to speak of the Golden Dawn, Crowley, magic and the old gods.

Namaste.
F.P.S.K."
