Kallas Ã¤ven Shadow of Memories.



The main story revolves around a 24 year-old man named Eike Kusch who dies in the beginning of the game in the year 2001 in fictional German town named Lebensbaum, from being stabbed to the back sfter leaving a small diner. However, he wakes up in a dark, strange place, where a mysterious voice offers to send him back in time to prevent his death. In this game, death is only the beginning.

Given the magical ability to travel through time, Eike has to visit four eras - the present day (2001), 1980, 1902 and 1580 - in which he will meet people that are all somehow connected to his life and destiny.

The game explores the deep question of who we really are and asks many philosophical questions. Some of the questions in the game stay unanswered - much like real life. Interestingly, the nature of the game is that Eike's time-travelling adventures can result in drastically different games. Sometimes, the actions of a character in one play-through can be completely different in another, revealing different origins, and wholly different lives depending on Eike's actions (similar to Westwood's Blade Runner or Quantic Dream's Fahrenheit). There is an overall set of actions that can be inferred from the different endings, but there are also conflicting results that cannot possibly co-exist. It is up to the player to find out what is truly happening in the game.
