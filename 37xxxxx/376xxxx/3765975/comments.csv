,ninjar123,2009-06-29T20:34Z,I can't find a crack for this ANYWHERE. Gamecopyworld does not work.
,gurudev1000,2009-07-20T20:35Z,"Hey Ninjar, I don't know why you mentioned that you can't find the crack. Gamecopworld works. All you have to do is click on the list of alphabetically arranged games on the right of the site and click on Shadow... when it shows in the list. there is the link to the no CD patch. I have finished d/ling it however still downloading the game. Hope I am not wrong here.."
