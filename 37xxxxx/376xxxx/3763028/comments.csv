This is the by far best quality rip I've yet come across, despite the low resolution. Also, the full version I mentioned above is cropped to 4:3, while this shows much more of the original image (with black bars on top and bottom). And yes, it does indeed contain the very end of the movie - however, approx 12 minutes are edited out - see http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066826/board/nest/31740011 for some details regarding the 2 versions.

Just 1 thing: The aspect ratio is wrong, resulting in a too wide image - change it to 4:3 (easily done in VLC) and it's just about right."
