,nightsongz2,2007-08-08T04:04Z,"It's real...just released today. Here is a review of this file from http://www.rlslog.net :

Here?s a new release from fairly well known group ViSUAL this time being an R5 of Oceans 13. Quality of this release is as you?d expect from an R5 having close to DVD quality. Audio of this release is also great being nice and clear since I don?t think that the audio is from a TS or anything like that. If you still haven?t seen this movie I recommend you download this release since there won?t be a better releas until a DVDRip is released. Download and Enjoy "
