,PyroSC,2007-08-07T08:29Z,"Only the original uploader is seeding is why it's going so slow. I've never connected to them yet, plus they might have a slow connection."

,maierm,2007-08-09T09:12Z,"Ubertino - 
To install
1. Unrar ECM'd image
2. Mount mds file with daemon tools (I use v4.08)
3. install use key gen provided
4. Patch

I did this just now to test it and it works fine. Good luck and have fun."
,maierm,2007-08-09T09:18Z,of course unecm. you can later delete to ecm'd image (not the actual image)
,PyroSC,2007-08-09T09:20Z,"Drag cims-ltr3.mdf.ecm onto unemc.ece

Mount the image using Alcohol 52% or 110%.

I had no problems loading it with 52%."
,maierm,2007-08-09T16:43Z,"Dont mount the mdf image file its got some problems with it. if you read the help file profided by Teamrpg its says so. Mount the mds file with daemon. the mds file give daemon the info on the image, like where it starts and ends. just unecm the image keep the two files together the from the image selection window on daemon select 'sow all files' and mount 'cims-ltr3.mds'"
