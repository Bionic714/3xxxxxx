What the fuck, man?"
,Duccio,2008-07-28T18:52Z,"Why, can't you use a program to see subtitles like everyone else?
Even your player can do that."
,ahuizi,2008-08-20T01:48Z,"Costello, if you're gonna fool around with torrents as a hobby.... get into it... and learn.
ConvertXtoDVD will bring in the .srt subs and they'll behave just as any other subs... i.e. you can enable them or not .. as you wish... much better than hard coded...."
,MR_SHYBOY,2008-09-24T04:28Z,"A personal favorite, but it is just stupid for people to upload it without checking if the freakin subtitles are working! >:("
,igorstravin,2009-01-20T21:31Z,Don't you people even speak Italian? How ignorant
,camj,2009-09-06T14:22Z,"hard coding subs is bad, be considerate of non english speakers who want to watch it with subs in their language"
,asulik,2011-05-25T11:55Z,details?
,Ypthor,2011-08-08T02:48Z,Is he actually complaining about the subtitles NOT being hard-coded? I can't stop thinking I'm reading it wrong :)
,anti-climacus,2011-08-22T06:18Z,At least this one isn't ENGLISH dubbed like that other moron's upload!
,cdromke,2012-01-25T21:21Z,"Costello is a little baby, he can cry and be ignored...
