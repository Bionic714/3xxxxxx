,bokiboy,2007-08-04T04:36Z,"Hey Smolder,  I will be glad to seed, if you explain me how.. I post it on the pirate bay, and now I am not sure if I have to turn on Azureus or just pirate bay does it by itself. If it's done by Azureus, how??

I didn't upload a lot of stuff that's why I don't know. Please tell me and I'll seed.
Thanx,
Boki 

It seems that my Farinelli upload has one seed, but Gladiator and Troy none.. :-("
