You get larger viewing window, text over video etc but you still show up as a NON pro user and cannot view more than one video window at a time. Still useful but it DOES NOT activate full Camfrog Pro."

,anytimej,2008-02-03T12:36Z,"spyfrog, you are an asshole"
,captainkremmen,2008-02-03T20:53Z,"agreed, spyfrog is a twat. Actually, serial numbers are shared on Camfrog all the time, I know, I have several serial numbers myself :-).

They are easy to find, especially on emule, if you get one and it keeps knocking you off, just keep logging back on. It means someone else also has it but most people will eventually give up because you keep knocking them off. Just be persistant and you'll eventually have the number all to yourself. Worked for me and several of my friends."
,captainkremmen,2008-03-09T22:06Z,"In that case spyfrog why have you uploaded other cracked programs without the authors permission?. That's just stealing you know. So it is OK for you to rip off someone else's work but it isn't OK for someone to do it to some camsite where you probably spend half your time wanking over 15 years olds?.

You are a hypocrit"

,didool30,2008-03-31T14:08Z,"You are using an old version of Camfrog.
You may download the newest version of Camfrog at http://download.camfrog.com."
,vixen-of-alcatraz,2008-05-06T17:53Z,"Wot is spyfrog doing on PirateBay if he is such an angel when it comes to software usage?
Spyfrog... you are correct when you say that life is expensive. This is why people use torrents... TO SAVE CASH!
Please don't preach, i'm sure you have the odd pirated album or piece of software at home."
,vixen-of-alcatraz,2008-05-06T18:08Z,"JUST TRIED TO RUN THIS & AVG PICKED UP THE CRACK AS A VIRUS.
I don't know if AVG is just having a fit, but I don't really want to try!
Does anyone know any decent video chat software?"
[T],Perlite,2008-09-03T10:21Z,spyfrog: Get the fuck off this site.
,Parallax_Coordinates,2008-09-07T19:06Z,"Vixen of Alcatraz, AVG gives a lot of false-positives, meaning that it identifies a lot of benign files as malicious code or viruses. Which is why I stopped using it (After AVG 8.0) and switched to NOD32 Business Edition. It is much better. "
,neuwelt,2008-10-05T10:10Z,spyfrog. You can't do anything better than masturbating with your genuine camfrog!
,CyrusJux,2008-10-28T23:39Z,NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM CAMFROG. Never support a company that uploads virus torrents to public torrent sites. We should go to war with this company.

,SSerpentineSS,2011-10-18T16:39Z,"It dosent matter, you are missing nothing, camfrog is a video chat program that is filled with pricks and idiots on a power trip"
,blitzmichael2,2012-02-20T18:44Z,IDIOTS they are false positives. those trojan signitures alter the codes of the program to enable some features. ASSHOLES. NOOBS who rely to much on their FAILURE of an anti virus.
