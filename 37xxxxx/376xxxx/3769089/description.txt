? It's 1864, and the First Michigan Cavalry is stranded in a Virginia forest, 
choking with smoldering fires and smoke and chilled by the distant cries 
of falling men. Among those stranded in this hell: the weary Sergeant 
Longacre (Steve Bacic, Out Of Order); Covington (Darcy Belsher, Legalise), 
an illustrator enlisted to capture the Civil War in unerring detail; and 
trooper Jim Rabb (Ryan Merriman, Taken), who counts his brother 
among the casualties, yet still rides his beloved mare Jen with a true 
soldier's indomitable will to survive. Then one morning Jim discovers 
that Jen has given birth and by her side is a newborn colt, shaking and 
afraid, born to chaos, and clinging to his mother for life. Longacre 
orders Jim to shoot the foal, lest it prove a hindrance. but Jim-seeing 
the colt as a consolation and a reminder of the beauty of life-refuses. 

An omen of good fortune, Jen and her nursing foal join the team 
of men marching toward unknown horizons. However, the camp is 
suddenly taken by Confederates, Jen and the colt are stolen, and 
Jim spurs a horse in a long, winding chase and shoots the fleeing 
soldier to retrieve the mother and baby. The incident has left him in 
darkness, afraid, lost, and separated from his bivouacked brigade, 
with a dying enemy on his hands. But honoring the Confederate 
Reb's last wish sparks in Jim a journey of remarkable honor and 
duty toward enlightenment and untold danger-one that will test 
the spirit and courage of a country at war and pay heartrending 
tribute to those of God's creatures who are blessedly innocent 
to the careless ways of man.
