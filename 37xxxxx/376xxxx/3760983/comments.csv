RubberTow, how hard is it to put the *full* link in the IMDB Info field?

It doesn't work if you only put in the database number.

I've only dl'd 2.2% since the minute it went up...

probably an indication i shouldn't be grabbing such a stupid looking movie..
Thanks.

,RubberTow,2007-08-19T07:51Z,"Its been dowenloaded 78 times and only has 7 seeds here. I've done my Job-RUBrTOE.
and for the IMDB number, I read on this site that I am supposed to put in just the number. So blame the idiots that run this site, not me. And for the stupid looking movie comment: there are only two things that make a movie worth downloading: T&A or P,D,C, W&A (plot, directing writing&acting) and this movie has one of those (Some of the hottest naturally endowed Playmates ever) , plus it was ripped by RUBrTOE, which guarantees that it is as clear and sharp as the original DVD it came on."
