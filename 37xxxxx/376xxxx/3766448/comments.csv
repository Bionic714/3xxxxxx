,coffeebaby,2007-09-09T02:57Z,searching for a expired license fix for encore cs3. ran out sept 1. CS3PPK keygen by X-Force does not work for encore standalone program
,R.T.2,2007-09-15T00:02Z,"Hi Coffeebaby;

I had the same problem with my standalone copy of Encore CS3 after Sep. 1 when Adobe secretly sent that patch down to disable all pirated copies of CS3 related products. 

However after Googling around for a while on it I found this simple method which managed to get my Encore as well as all other Adobe CS3 programs which suffered from the ?Expired License? error message back up again without needing to bother with the clock. 

If you still have a record of your old serial which worked before  Sep. 1. Try this?

1) First off, delete C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe PCD\cache\cache.db

2) Then run any of the CS3 (Encore in your case) programs. Click Accept to continue, then enter your serial that used to work. BEFORE clicking next, you'll notice that you have a NEW cache.db file in C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe PCD\cache

3) Right click the file, go to properties and make it READ ONLY, and then click next on CS3 after entering your key.

4) Next, after you get to the register software screen.

Click ""Register Later""

5) Now it should be working, technically speaking that is, but you're not done yet.

The register screen should have popped up again. This time, remove the check for ""Read Only"" from that new cache.db file and select ""Do Not Register"" from the the top of the register software menu.

6) Now, as soon as you click continue, make the cache.db file read only again, and LEAVE IT THAT WAY to prevent a possible reoccurrence or Adobe trying to send the patch through again disguised as an ""update"".

Remember that if you need to reinstall the serials of any CS3 product which was working prior to the creation since you have created a new cache.db file you must temporarily uncheck the ?read only? properties box for the cache.db. 

Then after inserting the serials and reactivating them close the program and then recheck the box.

Hope this works as it certainly did for me.

Good luck;

R.T.2

,R.T.2,2007-09-19T23:38Z,"First of all Silkfire, while I feel I can hold my own for the most part in dealing with computer related problems, I lay no claims to ""brilliance."" Also had you read my post carefully you can plainly see that I said ""after Googling around for a while on it I found this simple method."" Not that I ""made it up"" as you assert. 

Now not that I owe you any further explanations, but for the sake of others interested I actually found the original method on the ""Canon Digital Photography"" forum here at:

http://photography-on-the.net/forum/showthread.php?t=329050 

under a poster named ""Jasco."" Though he was replying to a different ""Expired License"" issue regarding the CS3 beta version to which I logically extrapolated over to this problem since they seemed similar, which happened to work. 

So if you want to accuse someone of plagiarism of your invention Silkfire, then please take it up with him. I was simply trying to help Coffeebaby and others here out, and not seeking any personal glory for myself.

When I get to step 3, after having made cache.db READ ONLY, I click on next (where I had entered a new working serial)... then I get greeted with the same ""product license expired"" message! It seems that Adobe staff also read your comment! Hell, if their software wasn't so expensive, I'd buy it! After all, I had purchased Macromedia Studio... but they've become excessively greedy now and they're seriously pestering us and wasting our time now. It took me more than 24 hours to fully uninstall Adobe CS3 and another 4 hours to reinstall the whole thing! By the way, I also used WinCS3Clean (dl from Adobe's web site), but after all this trouble I m still getting the ""Product expired"" message. Seems like one has to completely re-install Windows to get rid of it!

I hope some smart hacker finds a way to remove thae nasty piece of shitware that was installed by Adobe's updater. Bastards!

I think I'm going to give up on anything Adobe! including Flash! I'm going to switch to Silverlight instead. Besides, I was only using Photoshop(Pretty dumb of me, huh!) and Flash today is most used for annoying flashing Flash banner ads that try to attract your attention while you're concentraing to read!

That is not true MrMansson, at least not for everyone. I was well aware of Silkfire?s procedure on page three having first heard about it on demoniod.com (unfortunately I can?t post the specific link as TPB web-site rejects it with a ""database error."") 

However in the case of Coffebaby, I and other's CS3 programs this method of merely deleting the cache.db file, then proceeding to activate with your former key, even using a new one from ""x-force"" key generator he suggest wouldn?t work. 

For after you inserted it, even though you may receive the ""green"" check mark of acceptance, after hitting ""continue"" the dreaded ""License Expired"" message would still immediately appear. 

The method I posted allows you to use the old key which functioned prior to Sep. 1st and by using the check/uncheck ""read only"" box method, which silkfire did not mention, allows you to get past the ""License Expired"" message.

,mark17022,2007-11-27T11:49Z,"I managed to install this and ALL the UPDATES current at 25th Nov in Vista x64 (I'm guessing it would work in all versions of Windows) and have ALL PROGRAMS WORKING. I have tried heaps of different ways to install this before and always end up with different results, but mostly the ""license expired"" messages in Encore. This is how i got it to work.
* I uninstalled ALL Adobe products with standard Windows uninstaller
* Then ran ?Your Uninstaller! PRO 2006? which only found one thing to delete and is probably not necessary because of the next step to run, but I ran it anyway ?
* I then ran the Adobe CS3Clean Script tool (Google it to download from adobe). I actually have 2 versions of this tool. One I got a while back and it shows 4 levels of cleaning and the newer one that adobe lists now had 2 levels of cleaning. I ran both on the highest level, but I probably only needed to run the latest one which is V1.0.4. (The older ran ok in XP but not so well in Vista). The newer one also required me to install The Microsoft Windows Installer CleanUp Utility which I got from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301 .
* Restarted the PC
* I set the date back to August 1 2007
* Installed everything from the Production Pro CS3 Suite using the serial in the Readme.txt file in Keygens folder
* Activated it with the method in the same Readme.txt
* Every step after this point i created Restore Points so i could go back and try something different if it didn't work. (This worked very well once before when i tried updating a working copy of Premiere Pro from the Master Collection and the expired message appeared. A quick System Restore reverted it and it worked fine!) I also made a few images of my C: drive along the way with Acronis Trueimage in case system restore didn?t work but luckily everything worked first time! (and its probably overkill!)
* I went into Windows Firewall (use whatever firewall program you use to do this) and added all the exe files for everything i installed like AfterFX.exe, Adobe Premiere Pro.exe, Photoshop.exe  etc  AND the AdobeUpdater.exe  (in this dir C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\Updater5).  I then used the Change Scope button to only allow access to My Network (Subnet only) which blocks those exes from the internet.
* I ran all the installed programs to check that they worked and they did.
* I then installed all the patches that the Automatic Updater had downloaded for my previous Master Collection install (which are the same for this version). The default download directories are;

The updater deletes these files after it installs them, so to avoid downloading them all the time, you should copy them to another directory after they are downloaded and BEFORE the install finishes. Maybe I should make a torrent with the patches in it and these notes to make it easier!
* I then ran all the installed programs again to check that they still worked and all was good.
* Now here is where I hope it works the same for everyone. I set the date back to the current one and ran Encore, which was usually the only program that wouldn?t work with other attempted installs (although none would work if I tried to patch them) and the stupid License Expired message came up. After crapping myself I deleted the cache.db file under C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe PCD\cache and ran Encore again. When it asked me for a new serial I used the X-Force keygen this time (http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3791992/Adobe.Production.Premium.Suite.CS3.Keygen) and activated it with it and it ALL WORKS!
Now I'm sure some of these steps could be skipped or done different but I thought I would at least show you how it worked for me. Please let us all know this works for you so we can have some sort of definitive guide to all this chaos surrounding these CS3 installs!"

,edsu,2008-02-26T07:49Z,"After installing the first disk, the installer asks for disk 2.  When I use daemon tools to open the disk 2 iso, some files are extracted, but it doesn't install, and the installer still asks for disk 2 to be inserted.  I tried burning a disk of disk2, but it didn't make any difference.  I tried opening the AdobeAfterEffects8ProtectedAll file which was extracted, but it says to use setup.exe, and there is no setup.exe in the extracted disk 2 files.  
Disks 1, 5 and 6 will install, but disks 2,3 and 4 don't seem to.  
Does anyone know how to get round this?
Thanks"

,nnylive,2008-03-22T21:34Z,"Back in my 07, adobe sent me CS3 Production Premium CD 30 day trial package. Nat, it triggers licence expired after 30 days. To cirumvent, I did a major vista system re-install then ran cd's again and all works again for another 30 days. This is a pain! Question... is there a keygen torent that will activate this trial version? This would make things so much simple as I have actual adobe cd package."
,nnylive,2008-03-22T22:34Z,"Update:
The only part of this software package that I wanted was Ultra but you had to get the full production premium package to get it. The software was originaly written by Serious Magic, which, abobe bought out and added to their cs3 package.
Well, I just got it working again without having to set this vista puter back to orig config and having to re-install all of my other programs and software again. Now I'm not going to know if this will stop the 30 day trigger, but if it doesn't, it's real easy to start it over again.
NOTE: I installed the original 30 day trial version using the CD I received from Adobe included in the Production Premier package. With this in mind, here's how to restart Ultra CS3 after it hits the 30 day timer.
1) Uninstall the software using windows.
2) After uninstalled, download and run Adobe CS3 Clean (see Mark17022 post on 11-27-07).
3) Next deleat any files related to Ultra that you'll find in user/documents. This is where video info and settings are saved to when you use ultra.
4) Reboot your system
5) Disconnect your online access. DSL/Cable etc.
6) Re-install the software from the Trial CD.
7) Go to programs and start the software, accept the agreement etc.
8) Now find the cache.db file and set it Read Only.

Now the program is working again. I won't know if it will shut down again for 30 days though but I'll post results here. Worst case would be to repeat the process once a month. If this is needed, I would just move ultra files in user/documents/ultra to another folder then move back after new reinstall.

,kellyrae83,2008-04-11T18:09Z,I keep getting an error that says the license is expired.  Any thoughts?  Your help would be GREATLY appreciated.  Thanks.
,KMarch,2008-04-16T15:42Z,"For those who have Licence expired I have of two fixes that can fix your adode without unistalling or adding patches

SERIOUSLY NO UN-INSTALLED NEEDED! NO CRACKS NEEDED! READ CAREFULLY!!! andenjoy!! because I am so great!

FIRST FIX!! (TRY THIS FIRST)

(Tested on XP - Vista should be same!!)

Run Control panel
Run Administation Tools
Run Services

CLICK - FLEXnet Licencing Service

NOW! - set to MANUAL and click START!!!


Your adobe is now FIXED!

If not! dont worry heres the second fix!!!


FIX NUMBER TWO!!!

If your product took a bad key and you need to enter a NEW Key then you MUST delete every key (sorry but it the only way)

Click Start and RUN!

Type this

C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe PCD\cache\


DELETE! cache.db or back it up (no good if its expired your products)

Start photoshop or any adobe product 

TA-DA enter your key again (This time a better one) 

If you got lots of adobe products and a key works back upup your cache.db in case you enter bad one



ENJOY!!!!!!!!"
,mbrguy,2008-04-17T18:18Z,"God I hope this works.  This torrent took me 3 weeks to download.  I haven't tried it yet, but if it doesn't work, I'll be pissed."
,mbrguy,2008-04-18T07:45Z,"Thank God.  I installed it and it works perfectly.  I was very anxious because of all of the problems that others had.  I installed it and tried all of the programs including Encore, and every program pops right up and works.  

I didn't mount with daemeon or anything, I just burned the files to discs and installed.  Now, I did use the X-Force keygen because I've heard that the included keygens are infected, but I don't know if they are or aren't.  So far, everything works, and I am crossing my fingers that there isn't some sort of time limit like 30 days and it won't work anymore.  But after instillation and activation by phone, it took the activation code and booted right up.  I did go to my firewall and blocked all of the exe aplications for adobe so it won't update and stop working.  

Phew, it works!"
,FreekyMonkey,2008-04-22T21:06Z,Thanks for a nice torrent! Anyone got a working keygen or som serials that works?
,omkleem,2008-05-06T08:34Z,"You can change instalation language in file ""Main.ini""
in folder Autoplay on Disc 1
In Line 57 replace
""DEFAULT_LANG_CODE=JPN""
with
""DEFAULT_LANG_CODE=USE""

Activation works great with keygen


BUT!!!!
On the end, after installation, you will stil get some japanese squared shit.

How can I change it to english version"

,stycxxx,2008-06-09T15:32Z,"Hey guys. Just to let you know. I have done a lot of experiment to make the Encore work.

What I did to have Encore work perfectly was I installed the Adobe Master Collection Corporate Edition first. Just follow the instructions that comes with the download.

Then I run this installation (the Adobe CS3 Production Premium) and this time, it will prompt you the components that is not installed yet. You can use the keygen that comes with this package and after installing it, you will have a perfectly working Encore. The key generated by the key generator will work just fine."
