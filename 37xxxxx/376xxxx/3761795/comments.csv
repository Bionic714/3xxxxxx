email: dbprof0123@gmail.com
order key: d97de6be5f318315ec7991cf1775e7280bdf815d34e5a50c3f651fd1e2d298eee06e96f6f86bf98aab551aff5daea036b53cf9e2a2fdb19309998887d3a4e15a

Here's the way it can be done by you, the leecher:

1. leech the torrent containing the iso.
2. mount and install it using daemon tools.
3. create an email account on gmail or use your own if you wish.
4. open your folder where dark basic professional is installed and browse to the compiler folder. You'll see a file called ""TGCVerifier.exe"", click to run it.
5. Fill in the email you wish to use and make sure you have the iso mounted in daemon tools so it will check it for validity.
6. BINGO! You'll receive a nice email with your real unlock key. All too simple."
