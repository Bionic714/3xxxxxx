Please don't use h.264 profiles higher than 4.1 (4.0 is the standard for consumer media, ie BluRay/HDDVD) and never use more than 4 reframes for full 1080p video (9 is OK for 720p).   This video use profile 5.1 with 11 (!) reframes, making it not even close to playable by consumer hardware players (Popcorn Hour etc)."
