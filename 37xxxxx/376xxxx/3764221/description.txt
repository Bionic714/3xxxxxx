-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Mr. Bean enters a church raffle and wins a vacation trip to France as well 
as a camcorder. After boarding a Eurostar train and arriving in Paris, the 
French language proves a barrier for Bean, as he struggles to get across the 
city to catch a train to the south of France from the Gare de Lyon. Taking time 
to order a meal, he finds the consumption of a seafood platter to be a 
challenge. Just before catching his train, he asks Emil, a Russian film director 
on his way to be a judge at the Cannes Film festival to use his camcorder to 
record his boarding, but accidentally causes Emil being left behind at the 
station. Bean attempts to cheer up the director's son Stepan as the train 
continues south but matters are made more hectic by the fact that Emil has 
reported his son to have been kidnapped and Bean losing his wallet and essential 
travel documents at a pay phone where he and Stepan attempt to contact Emil. 
Heading in the direction of Cannes, Bean finds himself in the cast and 
disrupting the flow of a commercial being shot by the egotistical director 
Carson Clay. He and Stepan finally hitch a ride with the young and vivacious 
actress Sabine who is heading to Cannes to attend the premiere of Clay's film, 
in which she appears. After Bean sneaks into the showing, his camcorder images 
are destined to enliven the proceedings.
