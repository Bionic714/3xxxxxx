After several years of working on his sitcom, comedian George Lopez was finally allowed to return to his stand-up roots with his first HBO Special, GEORGE LOPEZ: AMERICA'S Mexican. Lopez also sticks close to his own roots here, never allowing the live audience he's playing to or us to forget his heritage. Admittedly, there was a portion of things he says in this special in Spanish that I didn't understand, but when he's speaking English, Lopez is hysterically funny. I loved his piece about how kids today couldn't have survived the way he grew up. It's so easy to forget how spoiled kids today are but Lopez reminds us in a most hysterical way. Lopez also offers on target jabs at Arnold Schwarzenegger, elder care,and of course President Bush. I love when he talks about post Katrina clean up in New Orleans and says that it was handled by FEMA, which means "Find Every Mexican Available". A laugh-out loud comedy special guaranteed to tickle the funny bone.
