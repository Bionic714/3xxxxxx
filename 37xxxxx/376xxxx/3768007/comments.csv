,Tech-Noir,2007-11-29T13:43Z,"I'm on 1.5 ratio thus far. Don't worry, I intend to seed this for a long time. Might not be particularly fast with this many leechers, but I won't abandon it just yet.

Still, people seem to be bailing left and right. If others seed for you to download 32 GBs, it's only fair you help out yourself, eh? :)"

I would love to test this program out, to see if I am able to use it and understand it all, before shelling out $650, only to learn it is beyond my abilities.  Please help with a reg code for the Install.  THNX"

,far_isle1,2008-08-17T17:50Z,OK Danell - I think it worked.  I just had to rename the Keygen to something else - and AVG (I know it is a mess) and Stopzilla (a malware proggie) sidestepped it.  Thanks for the answer - when the 32GB Library is  done and I can install and run it.  Thanx
,Jaffamarken,2008-08-21T17:32Z,"Hi, hi! Nice work with the colossus!

But I have one question in mind. I wonder if I need something more than just the install and the library folder? I use Cubase SX 3, do I need something more...except for a big harddrive ;)
