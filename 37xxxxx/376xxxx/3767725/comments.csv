Bye the way - thank You compare!"
,gs_11_49,2007-10-12T21:07Z,"I can't get this torrent to start. All the others in this series work just fine, but utorrent says this file is not a valid torrent. 

Any suggestions?"
,gs_11_49,2007-10-12T21:15Z,"And then after about 8 or 10 attempts, it finally worked. I have no idea what the problem was."
,jmg999,2009-02-04T08:41Z,There's no clear indication on how to play the English audio. When you play the DVD the menu gives you a choice of either Castellano or Portuguese. Please explain how to play this DVD in English. Thank you.
,torgman1,2009-02-17T04:43Z,"jmg999: select any language. For Castellano (aka, Spanish), pick ""seleccion de audio y subtitulos"" then pick ""ingles."" For Portuguese, pick ""configuacao"", then pick ""ingles."" If you play this in WMP, right click on the movie while it plays and you can select a language there.

Now, can someone tell me how to get this to fit on a whole DVD-R or how to get it so it will play on another computer and my DVD player? My Nero won't let me do it. "
,jmg999,2009-02-20T11:58Z,"torgman1, thanks very much for the instruction on how to play these DVDs in English.  As for your question, it appears that you'll need to burn these to a dual-layer DVD, which will require a dual-layer DVD burner, if you don't have one.  Good luck!"
