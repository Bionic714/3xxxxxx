,Lydrahim,2007-08-03T04:07Z,"I don't know much about torrents and stuff....but either this one is poorly seeded......or it's a fake.

So if it's possible....please seed so we may enjoy this movie....."
,carv,2007-08-09T22:33Z,ffs RubberTow! Quit upping new stuff until somebody is able to download a complete copy of any of your previous material. It will take months to get any of this stuff at your current seeding rate!
,RubberTow,2007-10-07T17:46Z,"It's not a fake. It was seeded. Now it is practically unseeded again because nobody keeps it on their hard drive. Get a clue fercripes sakes - RUBrTOE. also, try other torrent sites, there are more seeds fdor my files elsewhere"
,yolt13,2008-09-17T00:31Z,"NEED HELP WITH SIDARIS FILMS! 

Looking for Andy Sidaris' early films, STACEY and SEVEN (aka SEVANO'S SEVEN). The only place online to get them is Cinemageddon, but when I try to register there, they don't send me a confirmation email. If anyone out there has these movies, or is a Cinemageddon members and can get them, please upload them to Pirate Bay! I'll be eternally grateful, and I'll seed indefinitely!

Please help! Thanks!"
