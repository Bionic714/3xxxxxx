,Djsanz,2008-07-24T11:51Z,"The video quality falls out of sink with the audio stream from time to time. Could be that it wants converting back to it's original format ripped from disc as you get two cd files. I've played around with it and cant watch it without getting agitated; i won't download anything at less than dvd quality mostly, though i think this is from a dvd and needs tweaking once downloaded. hope this helps people and if anyone else sorts it out please get back with more comments"

,Djsanz,2008-07-24T12:00Z,"I think i've sorted it, i've converted back to mpeg ntsc dvd file and seems to have worked although i havent watched all of it yet. Doing this or simply converting to a dvd disc will automatically sort this problem. "
,Djsanz,2008-07-24T12:12Z,"Yep, done cd2 and the quality is a lot better now, you have to remember that this was VHS format before it was out on dvd; it's that old. So, you have to convert back to original format."
