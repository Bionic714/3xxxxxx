,phreaks2007,2007-08-14T13:34Z,"aztekrille : Watch your language, dude : aren't you proud of your mother tongue, so you stand up for english? Anyway, I understand a swedish NEEDS to learn a foreign language : were the hell is swedish spoken outside of your country? 
Not like French, former international language, and widely spoken. + for a French, speaking english is like betraying his origins :-))
And, by the way, yes, it's a french who wrote this in... english. Not bad uh?? (I could give you a few lessons if only you could pay in ?, sorry I don't accept shitty currencies like crowns or bananas)
Et aussi je suis d'accord, un zip pour une vidéo, ça pue l'arnaque!"
,phreaks2007,2007-08-14T13:37Z,"Assembly : I agree with you, buddy! Just add Volvo to the list, the worst shit I ever had!!!"
,aztekkrille,2007-08-17T22:05Z,"Well this is a SWEDISH SITE!!!!
SO WHY DON´T YOU KEEP YOUR FRENCH TO A FRENCH SITE??

SWEDISH IS NOT SPOKEN OUTSIDE SWEDEN CAUSE WE LEARN ENGLISH IN SCHOOL LIKE MOST COUNTIES IN THE WORLD, BUT FRENCH....NO...LETS KEEP TO FRENCH......WHY..CAUSE THEY DONT KNOW BETTER!"

,heldon,2007-11-13T02:15Z,"Hello,

For all, from all countries, is it so important to speak english or not ? Or to speak French or not ?

Many Swedish speak English. OK, fine.
Some French speak English. OK, fine.

And what's the matter ? 

Some German speak Italien. Some Spanish
speak Indian ....

We found Swedish torrent, Spanish torrent, and German and so on. Why not in French ? Why not in Chinese ?

If everybody find what he wants : it's  the most important.

Bye.
