? 	It's the late '60s and the British Invasion has conquered the 
world! The Liverpool Sound tops the charts in every country, except 
in Ireland, where traditional Irish music still reigns supreme! But could 
the unthinkable happen? Could an upstart Irish band from Liverpool 
win the All Irish Music Championship for the first time in history? 
Transplanted Irishman Jimmy McMahon (Colm Meany) and his 
motley English crew have their hearts set on it. Meanwhile, back in 
County Clare, Ireland, Jimmy's stalwart older brother, John Joe 
(Bernard Hill) and his feisty local band are determined to win the 
trophy for the third year in a row. Meanwhile, Clare's star fiddler, 
Anne (the radiant music icon Andrea Corr of The Corrs family band), 
chafes under her mother's rules against dating - especially when her 
eye lands on Teddy (Shaun Evans), Liverpool's star flute player. 
They are Ireland's answer to Romeo and Juliet.

The film weaves these timeless themes of discord - star-crossed 
lovers, feuding brothers, narrow-minded parents and rebellious 
children - with the passion all the characters share for the music 
they play. And, against a backdrop of amber-lit pubs, narrow streets 
and sandy shores, the visuals keep pace with toe-tapping soundtrack 
and reflect the honor and traditions at stake in the competition.
