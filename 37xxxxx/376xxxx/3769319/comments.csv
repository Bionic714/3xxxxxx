,surfkw,2008-01-31T10:35Z,I only see one user with 100% of the file in my connected users.  That means people are finishing downloading and not seeding.  It would help the rest of us if you seed for awhile after finishing your file!
,naelq,2008-01-31T17:08Z,"sorry guys, but i canceled my download! just found it on another ""private tracker"" where they DO respect each other!!

[T],TaurusKJ,2008-02-03T19:08Z,"these are avi files. Although the video is high quality, whenever I burn them to DVD, the audio loses sync.  Any suggestions on how to fix or what to burn with to avoid the problem would be appreciated!  Thanks in advance."
[T],TaurusKJ,2008-02-03T19:12Z,"By the way, I probably should mention that i've been using Nero 7, because I can create a menu."

,eyelines,2008-03-23T21:23Z,"Please seed this. I can keep this seeding for weeks, but I feel sorry for the 1 seeder who's having to seed to 117 of us peers! At 17 kB/s, that's going to take 414 hrs to download. If I continue seeding, it'll take almost the same amount of time to seed it so that at least one other person has 100% -- not a very sustainable torrent, is it?"

,ShieAyla,2009-02-05T02:52Z,"Seed please. Right now it says it will take aprox 2 weeks, give or take. I would really appreciate someone seeding at a little bit higher rate. In return I will seed at 50kb/s until I have the whole file and promise to seed at unlimited for one week after that. Fair? I'm willing to contribute, will you do the same? Please?"
,ShieAyla,2009-02-05T16:11Z,Thank You to whoever is seeing his half loaded file at 200 Kb/s ..... in good faith I've upped my UL speed to 100 (Only because I only have 15% of the file). My DL says only one day with everyone helping out. THANKS!
,ShieAyla,2009-02-07T18:46Z,"Ya know, people are so stingy. Now since I have like 73% of the file everyone with 100 is seeding at .9 Kb/s. SO it is going to take me the same length of time to DL the last 25-30% as it did the first 73%. Lucky you that I am still a person of my word and promise to Seed at unlimited for a whole week once I have the whole file. Right now the highest person I'm receiving off of is at 12% ..... nice."
,ShieAyla,2009-02-07T18:59Z,I meant 12 Kb/s
,paradox1212,2009-02-08T01:18Z,"seed please, around 3k/s a second. when i get up to 50% i will boost my max upload to 50 or higher, depending how long it takes. then i will stay d/ling and uploading while i sleep please just seed =("
,paradox1212,2009-02-08T02:23Z,"ill make a deal with everyone here, whatever my d/l speed is my upload speed shall be higher. so if i d/l at 2.5 kb/s (my avg) i shall upload @ 5 or 10 and if its over 60 i will go unlimited speed"
,ShieAyla,2009-02-08T08:54Z,My problem is I have the highest % seeding right now and so I can't get the rest of the file in a decent time ... AND good luck finding someone who already HAS this file who reads this page anymore. I increased my uploading to 100 Kb/s so I hope that helps everyone else. When I get the WHOLE file I'll seed at unlimited ..... not that anyone had the courtesy to do the same for me.

,.hotzenplotz,2009-04-06T23:57Z,"xyphur is right, in Season 1 it is episode ""19 - Deus ex machina"" which has a few black screens and strange screen flickering during the last minutes. All the seasons before that were very good in quality though."
,.hotzenplotz,2009-04-09T23:07Z,and the above comments about the steep incline between upload and download speed are true. I have uploaded at 70kb/s a whole day and have an average speed of 30kb/s.

,ludedude,2009-04-17T11:03Z,"To all you people begging others to SEED...get a clue. O.K. - you learned how to download torrents now you need to learn how to open ports 6881-6889. Instead of bitching about d/l speeds. This torrent came in at over 500kBps for me - consistently. Well seeded torrents always do; if you have your router/firewall configured properly. Try googling ""port forwarding"" along with your router model."
,ludedude,2009-04-17T11:29Z,also...Season 2 Episode 21 - Question Mark - has bad audio. You can hear the music and such but no dialogue.

,.hotzenplotz,2009-04-29T02:14Z,"@ludedude:
I am using Transmission (a mac torrent client) with which you can only specifiy one open Port, but this one is definitely open and correctly forwarded to my Router. 

I do not know how you got your dl speeds, maybe you got a very fast DSL line with huge upload bandwidth to receive the DL speed you posted. The fastest I got out of this torrent was 200 kB/sec DLspeed once, but the average lurches at 20 kB/sec. 

Thus you may shove your snotty comment up your a**. Got me?!"
,.hotzenplotz,2009-04-30T20:21Z,"I boosted my upload rate, but the dl rate has not increased remarkably. This has nothing to do with opening ports (at least in my case), but with the 	pusillanimousness of leechers who seed at low rates. "

Will seed all files completely :)"
,sonamm20,2009-08-07T11:07Z,"Awsome torrent!

I'm getting like 100kb+ all the time with just 2 seeds.

Hope they're good quality."
,08millerj,2009-08-18T02:31Z,can someone explain why there are 3 seeds with (230) beside the 3? does this mean that i can only use the 3 seeds instead of using all 230? i been leeching for over 1 weeks without shutdown and am finally at 97%
,gramsp,2009-12-11T17:37Z,"wow, 50 seeders to 441 leechers. this is what's wrong with public trackers. i really wish that people understood that, if you don't seed, then BitTorrent just won't work. i mainly use a private tracker (to get amazing speeds--- sometimes 900kb/s on one torrent!) 

i always seed torrents on public trackers to a ratio of 3.0. i feel that putting that out for someone will come back to me in some form, eventually. 
it's like smoking people out: you might not get smoked out immediately,  but it ALWAYS comes back. 

please, for the greater good, SEEEEEEED !

,airmj,2010-04-27T00:00Z,"OpusAtrum: Good point, but i would like to enhance it. I search torrents always at Torrentz com which searches a few torrent sites, including ThePirateBay. When you click a torrent there you can see list of all trackers brought together from all the sites like BtMon and ThePirateBay, and you can download this list in a uTorrent format. I always do that."
,Thetruesong,2010-04-29T06:44Z,"It puts me off seeding when theres a million douchebags constantly telling me to seed. I will seed the program if i like the content. Same for everyone else, SO FUCK OFF AND STOP ASKING EVERYONE TO SEED"
,JRLS,2010-06-18T20:32Z,"this is nice! thanks for the upload!

one problem, i want subs, but all the files are renamed, so I cannot see anymore what the original filename was!
e.g. Lost.S02E19.HDTV.Xvid.XOR.avi, or
Lost.S02E19.HDTV.Xvid.PROPER.2HD.avi, etc, etc.

Now, i dont know now what release it is, so i dont know which sub to download! 

Does anyone has a list, or a proper file list?
thanks :)"
