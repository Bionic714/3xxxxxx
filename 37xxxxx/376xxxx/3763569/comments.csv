Real and good quality. I don't go with others on bitchin about quality anyway. THESE are FREE. Like others say go buy it if you want HD quality. At least torrents let u see what u'd be buying before u do.

I ALWAYS seed AT LEAST a 1.0 and sometimes just leave them running for a 10-20 ratio. That helps downloads faster.

Thanks again Ltt"
