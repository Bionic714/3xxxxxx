SUPER"
,you_a_bitch_nigga,2007-08-12T02:27Z,"whats up man, this has two missing games ive been looking for. as for the person who said ""do i have a 5g or 5.5g."" from what i was told if you have a search option ( on the main menu music>search) on your ipod menu screen you have a 5.5 generation. if you do not see a search option in the menu you have a 5th generation. i never seen the 5th generation first hand, i only own and seen 5.5 generations."
,[Maga]Zine,2007-08-13T04:50Z,no prob. Yea I only upped the 5.5gen I guess cuz I have a 5.5gen. For those of u that dont kno the difference 5Gen has Bono on the cover you got the iPod in and 5.5gen has johny depp as the pirate of caribean
,kofmiester,2007-08-13T07:31Z,"Now all this is all well and good. But for the Mac users, what're they gonna do? cause even if they format the iPod on the windows machine to achieve this, after syncing a couple of times on their mac, the computer will not see the iPod and will have to restore. How will mac users achieve this? Is there anyway to achieve this hack? I mean, I will be able to get up to the invisible folders and probably copying files from the pc but what about the iPod Firmware? Windows computers cannot write to Mac formatted iPods...."
,[Maga]Zine,2007-08-14T02:18Z,"I dunno kofmiester that sucks for u guys... just dont auto-sync?????? lol I manuell sync all my songs, videos, sorrry... I have no sollution"
,kongnavn,2007-08-14T19:45Z,"Apen Hans... I'm guessing you couldn't use the 5.5 version games on the 5 gen version, or did you not try it?  Let us know, bc I really want these games and have a 5 gen and'll try it, but if you had a terrible experience (like everything died and you had to send it to apple for three months to get fixed) i won't bother. Maga, do you think it'll work?"

,kofmiester,2007-08-20T20:32Z,"Is there a way for Mac users to write the firmware to their iPods? Cause Windows machines cyar write to iPods formatted by Mac OS.
Any Mac users found a way for this procedure to work? Or was there another way that Mac OS X users got to successfully put the games on the iPod and be able to play them after?"

'I don't get it', I never installed games before... it came with it from the box... the four ones I have. does that mean I already have the firmware somewhere in the hidden files or need to download it again to get the super suped ones?"

BUT i got a problem, i recently updated my ipod, and now the games no longer work..i just get the ""this game cannot be played"" screen

anybody hav any ideas to fix this?"
,eovnu87435ds,2007-12-07T01:25Z,there is a much easer and non-destructive way to do this. all you need is winRAR. click on the game you wish to have in winRAR(make sure you havnt imported it into iTunes yet.) and navigate to iTunesMetaData or iPodMetaData. there will only be 1 there. right click it and click extract to folder. extract it to a folder and then navigate to it with windows. open it up with notepad. it may be easier if word wrapping is turned on. find the email address in there and change it to the one that you use for your iTunes account. save and close notepad. drag and drop the file in winRAR(make sure that you are still in the game you want) and click OK to copy and replace the old file. enjoy! just open it in iTunes  and it will ask for the password for the account of the email address you typed in! thats it!

,Toomuchmusic,2008-04-28T06:37Z,"great job here, thanks for the share. I have all these games already so I will not download. I can't believe how dumb people are asking you all these questions that you already answered in the description. The first sentence says for ""ipod video games for 5.5gen firmware"" a reminder for the idiots that read comments instead of description. Thanks for your time to do descriptions, even though dumbasses don't read it. lol thanks for sharing "
,[Maga]Zine,2008-05-01T06:42Z,"kaka_22: try reinstalling the cracked firmware pretty sure that will do it...If not sorry I can't help

Toomuchmusic: yea man.. I've had to answer the same questions a billion times ahah"
,ohnoitskimmy,2008-05-30T05:12Z,"ok... so. i'm stuck on Step 8.
""Step 8: Click ""Open Firmware"" and choose either ""5g Firmware.bin"" or ""5.5g Firmware.bin"" based on weather you have a 5g or a 5.5g iPod.  If you choose the wrong one, you will have to boot into disk mode and restore your iPod.""

i have Ipodwizard and i know how to do everything past this step.. i just don't know where to find ""5g Firmware.bin"" or ""5.5g Firmware.bin""
i read some comments and found the torrent that another person made that i guess was those firmwares but when i tried to open them with Ipodwizard, they weren't .bin
they were rar..


help please please?
thank youu"

,paulg08,2008-08-18T16:42Z,please seed!!!!!!!!
,mcbuttons,2008-08-28T21:16Z,"Maga, you seem to have been made very miserable by having uploaded these files. . . that's too bad.  You seem to be rather new at this, however.  I've got some advice to help you avoid frustration in the future: 
1) don't list the 5gen/5.5gen distinction by the pictures on the box of your ipod purchases. . . lol.
2) do some research on the ipod generations before pulling out your hair when ppl respond to with detailed questions (the 3gen ipod nano is either a 5gen or a 6gen device I think).
3) You don't have to have all the answers, so, you can say ""I don't know.""
4) Try always to avoid treating others as your parents treated you (they clearly weren't good to you)."
,tjgamer32,2008-09-26T06:05Z,Is there a way to have the game and your music at the same time?? like combine the firmware file to let the games play and your music??
,[Maga]Zine,2008-10-18T21:56Z,"mcbuttons:

1.)most dumb as people are not smart enough to physically decrypt the serial to know the gen. or follow when new ipods come out.
2.)you obviously have no fucking idea what you are talking about the generations of ipods.
3.)every question I have been asked, I have known.
4.)fuck you, you don't know me.
5.)torrents are for dumb asses that don't know how to get into the scene releases.
6.)I uploaded this for people.
7.)I programed this shit myself.
8.)fuck you.
9.)fuck you
10.)fuck you"
