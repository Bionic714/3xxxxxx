Rape Of The Red Temple aka Burning Paradise (1994)

HKFlix Says:  	3 Stars

Ancient costume kung fu meets "The Temple Of Doom". Clearly inspired by that Harrison Ford film, "Burning Paradise" adds lot of innovative wire-fu with creative choreography and plenty of weirdness. Unfortunately, it seemed to drag at times.

Overview:	During the Ching dynasty the Shaolin monks tried to oppose the Machu government and so they were hunted like dogs and punished for their beliefs. The story picks up as young Fong Sai Yuk (Willie Chi) and his master are riding horseback trying to flee the Manchus. Whilst taking shelter they encounter a young girl by the name of Tau Tau (Carman Lee) who is a prostitute trying to escape her past. When the soldiers catch up with them Fong's master is killed and they are captured and taken to the temple of the Red Lotus sect.

Inside is a torturous world where monks are made to denounce their faith and thrown to rot if they are crippled or unable to be put to work. On Sai Yuk's arrival he forces a duel with Bak, the right hand woman of psychopathic Sun (who is the master of the temple). When he defeats her he is on the verge of killing Sun when he is stopped by his Shaolin brother and old friend Hung Hei Kwan (Sheng Yang). It would appear that Hung has betrayed his humble beginnings and become a Shaolin dog.

Fong is wounded in the battle and thrown into the corpse pit. Sun has taken a shine to Tau Tau and grants her any wish so she asks to have Sai Yuk healed. Once he is free, Sai Yuk starts making plans to destroy the temple and free his brothers for the sake of all Shaolin kind.
