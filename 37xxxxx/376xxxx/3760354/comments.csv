,Schopenhauer,2007-08-02T16:19Z,"Message to all you 29 leechers:
It is tated here that there are 1 seeder, but its untrue there are 0. So we are like 20 peoplw that got 55% or so. I have found this movie on another tracker, the exact same rip. Im downloading it now, and when it finishes i will put it in this torrents folder, recheck it, and all you people here will be able to get the rest of the 45% missing. Thanx alot to tpb and bergmanbits.com for your efforts, and remember that this world will only truly be better  if people help ech other out. That is a truth not only related to downloads.

,sourman,2007-08-22T04:24Z,"Thanks for this great movie. Seen it a long time ago and it left a good memory.

Rajande, 1 seeder out of 10 downloads thats the norm. I figure all that sharing is due to 10% of the sharers...90 % are assholes. I seed, I have unlimited bandwidth, so why not give back ? But I have friends (!) that have the same promo and stop as soon has there finish. 

They act greedy with somthing they don't even pay for ! That's how selfish poeple are. Hope you could get a copy."

,korpen,2012-03-24T06:26Z,"NOTE: The audio is out of sync! How come noone has noticed in almost 5 years, is it because Swedish isn't your native language?"
,korpen,2012-03-24T07:13Z,>> set audio to -0.2secs and the movie becomes watchable
