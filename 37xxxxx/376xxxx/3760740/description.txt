*The Medical Aspects of Nuclear Radiation

Attempt to argue away the dangers of nuclear radiation, with some excellent animation.

Have no fear Nuclear Radiation can't be that bad, You are better off with mutated kids anyways!

Pretty amusing and alarming detailing of what puportedly Radiation can and cannot do to you. You see, It's not the radiation that will kill you, it's the blast! So stop worrying about it, go outside 3 minutes after the blast and eat all you want! Don't read those (great) newspaper ads warning about radiation! Don't listen to the radio! And don't worry about your hair, it'll grow back, and besides, you can always wear a toupee! Pretty amazing.

The naration is alternately patronizing and clueless, making this a highly amusing example of 50s cold war propaganda.


*Aspects of Nuclear Radiation (1950's propaganda)

This film tries to dispell fear of nuclear radiation by such tactics as portraying the human body as a factory run by pixies, telling you you can always get a toupee if your hair falls out, and informing you that you'll be dead before getting a high enough dose of radiation to make you sterile. The naration is alternately patronizing and clueless, making this a highly amusing example of 50s cold war propaganda.
