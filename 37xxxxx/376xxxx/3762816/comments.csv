,zerounu,2007-08-07T11:48Z,Hello guys..i am trying to make a bootable dvd but after i burn the image the dvd dont boot from startup...and is this un OS or just a Microsoft Application?
,s1ay,2007-08-07T14:25Z,This isn't an OS.  It's an addon for Microsoft Office that has extra recorses for school and other things.  Look at the URL in the details.

[T],sotis,2007-08-20T21:51Z,I can't understand why you have problems finding enough seeders on this one. You must have som bad settings in your bittorrent-client.

""A file that is required cannot be installed because the cabinet file X:\FINDSTE.CAB has an invalid digital signature. This may indicate that the cabinet file is corrupt.""

Any tips would be appreciated. Thanks!"
,goudacheese,2007-12-06T12:31Z,"I was able to make it work. I'm not sure though which one solved it. It was either applying this:

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918781
(just regsvr32 softpub.dll)

or copying the content to the hard disk before doing the install.

Thanks NoPE!

Works perfect on Windows Vista Ultimate!"
