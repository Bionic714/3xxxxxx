,aunwit,2007-08-27T14:59Z,...hows the quality of this? can anyone provide a screenshot?
,Fat_D,2007-09-25T10:42Z,"The cover says Japanese with German subtitles. However, I do not have the ISO yet. Now what is it? Guess I'll have to find out."
,melfice26,2007-09-27T07:22Z,Read info...
,blaauwe,2007-10-03T18:17Z,"Dudes, please seed! Stuck at 90 frikin' %!"
,Vilicus,2007-12-24T21:41Z,"FatD, I'm wondering the same thing.  Hopefully it will be Eng dubbed like the info says.  43%."
,Bannana.swe,2007-12-29T15:56Z,thnx
,bidpheonix,2008-01-03T04:09Z,im downloading now hope to fack its english i love elfen lied :) meow!
,Demosthenes928,2008-01-11T22:53Z,"Now this is really strange, I'm trying to download this, but it won't let me. It has an error message that says, ""There is not enough space on the disk."" And that's weird because I have about 140 GB of memory left on my hard drive, and I'm using uTorrent, which I've not had a problem with before. Anyone else have this problem?"
,melfice26,2008-01-16T19:34Z,"Is your hard drive formatted as FAT32 or NTFS.
A Fat32 drive won't let you save a file bigger than 4 Gigs, so if tis is the case, format the drive to NTFS."
,melfice26,2008-01-16T19:34Z,"And yes it's in ENGLISH.
Greetz"
,BigDragonCool,2008-01-18T22:22Z,is this in NTSC.........is any of your uploads in NTSC? 
,Demosthenes928,2008-01-31T07:28Z,"melfice26: Thanks for the info, but I'd rather not format it since I'd lose all my data. Plus I don't feel like backing up 300 GBs worth of data."
,sg7346435,2008-02-13T21:58Z,No seeda ? 
,Necro-File,2008-03-02T23:49Z,"Even though I have over 200GB free, this particular torrent keeps telling me there's not enough space on the disc I am saving it to. What in the fucking hell?"
,melfice26,2008-03-29T07:25Z,"gain the same story as mentioned above.
Reformat your drive from FAT32 to NTFS.
When you do this, you DO NOT lOSE data.
Google is your friend."
