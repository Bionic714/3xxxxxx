,borak stiller,2007-08-09T21:44Z,"OK blankbox and folks, I can't believe it.  From the moment I reluctantly decided to install this I had a clean install in about 4 minutes.  Just as smooth as silk, no fuss, no muss, no smell.
I made some notes for you others.  Firstly the ZIP Scan extract for the part 3 sceneries from the PREVIOUS project made wales and the water look like an ugly bed spread.  Something wrong there so I deleted it all.

Now to this project.  It's Central and Southern England and install 4 parts 2-1,2-2,2-3 and even a mesh file.  Oddly it installed it in a new scenedb folder in the MainFS9 folder and even added it to the top of the Scenery Library.  That location might need some adjustment.

I've been flying out of farnborough and it looks just fine so far.  So that means we have part 2 of the 3 or 4 part set.  I don't think this Just Flight version has a 4 th part for the North like the visual flight version does.  It's not on the JF web site anyway.
There was also an extra file included for fooling the installer into thinking this is FS2002.  That was not requited but from reading up I think it is required for the Wales and SW England part so hang on to it.
Oh yes, I mounted disk 1 with daemon tools and when it asked for disk two all I had to do was point it to the file on my desktop, which, oddly, isn't even an image file, just a CAB.  Oddly it didn't ask for disk 3 so I don't know if it even used that file.  It totals about 1.8 Gb installed.
Cheers to blankbox, now we only need 2 or three more parts.
I think there are a few updates at Just Flight to check out and download freely."
