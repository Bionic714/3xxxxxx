[V],Subzero!,2007-08-04T13:56Z,"indeed, but be warned, if you are having a fast pc nowadays, its a bit tricky to have that one running on the right frame rate, everything goes a bit faaaaaaaast like menu changing and things like this!...."
,micarone,2007-12-16T06:39Z,"Thanks for uploader! I hope this one works.
I downloaded some other torrent/version of this game some time ago but it didn't work. It crashed every time when driving should've been started. :(
No matter what patches I installed.
I thought that it had something to do with my PC but when I downloaded a demo of this game and tried, it worked out just perfectly."
