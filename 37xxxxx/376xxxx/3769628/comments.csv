,jennysalala,2007-08-11T12:31Z,There's a PPC64 build in process or at least I heard there was. In other words it will allow to run Ubuntu on your PS3 in 64bit for faster loading. I saw somewhere someone put Fedora 5 PPC64 on the PS3.

,gegueure,2008-12-17T08:16Z,"Sorry, i have the cd but not the iso.
the iso i have is Xubuntu for PS3 wich is pretty much the same but ""family-friendly"" edition.
i'll create a torrent of it."
