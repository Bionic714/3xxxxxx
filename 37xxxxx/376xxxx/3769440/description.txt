"Medieval glam rock with hard Balkan beats" ? now, that description could imply a LOT, for good or for bad.
However, Patrask ? five guys from the small Swedish town of Falun ? is _musically_ probably much more medieval than they are rock, as they after all play medieval (and folk) music on medieval instruments like bagpipes and shalms. But their attitude is far from the more academic interpretations of medieval music. "ÖS", the Swedish word which has given this album its title, is hard to translate to English, but it's about something rather heavy, sweaty and ... Dionysian.

This one is a must both for fans of "real" early music, as well as for people who dig Balkan brass bands (or, well, glam rock...).
