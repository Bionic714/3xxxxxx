This unique film propels the viewer into the biggest water rides in the world. Allowing the viewer to enter the living bodies of others, it reveals how a drop of sweat becomes a river, a flash flood or a hurricane, and explains what makes water so special. Water makes up two-thirds of the human body and makes incredible journeys, from floating among the clouds to sinking to the bottom of the ocean, all the time. Parts of the body have been to unimaginable places - places too dangerous to visit, too small to see or too distant to reach. Now this film can take the viewer back to experience these places.
