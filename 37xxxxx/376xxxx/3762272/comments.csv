,gatsu3,2009-09-04T08:17Z,"well, it seems most of these ppl are foreign, and the ones asking questions in english seem half-retarded.

let me ask you this question:
is this english dubbed? [meaning: do they speak english? or is this dubbed in another language?]

it would be even better if u were to put an emphasized DESCRIPTION on what this download includes
-language [dubbed]
-language [subtitles]
-how many episodes

just tryin to help out cuz no one wants to d/l 2.5gigs of something they don't understand."

,murtaza786,2012-05-13T15:09Z,"thanks anonymous
the torrent is real and not fake at all
audio is good and video is okay but for that size, the video is good
FGS read the description, the guy/girl did mention that he/she mistakenly wrote that subtitles are there
Whereas spoken language is ENGLISH as mentioned by the uploader
could u please do this for other seasons also
Thanks"
