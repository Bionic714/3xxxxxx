,TheThiird7,2007-08-30T03:42Z,does anyone know the password for the game?
,Smy..,2007-08-31T00:10Z,"All lot people about talk keygens, serials or patches... the true is, its a online mmporg.. and all key´s are server given. Before your acount is active you MUST give a legal payment method. 
By the way..City of Villains is not integrated.. 
Its only city of Heroes..."
,bengaliboy,2007-12-22T02:01Z,so that means i cant play it even if i downloaded it illegaly?
,mekke92,2008-03-05T14:24Z,"... R-tards.. There is multiple ways to play several MMORPG's for free on private hosted servers. Just search google for example ""city of heroes private"" and you will get for example ""www.topgamesites.net"" where you can find about 100 free private servers to the latest MMORPG's. So YES you can play City of Heroes for free if you download it but NOT on the retail servers."
,Mugenkun,2008-03-17T01:23Z,"@Smy..
City of Villains IS integrated when you have valid key for CoH only."
,dark_justice1986,2008-04-01T05:14Z,I am downloading it now. I am hoping to play for free on a private server.
,gameric3,2008-04-08T00:25Z,"I can't find a working server, someone link it."
,nyahnyah,2008-04-14T18:17Z,Thanks so much :D I'm at 71.8 % I'll be sure to seed. oh and thanks mekke for explaining how to play illegally
,Thrifty94,2008-05-04T22:53Z,"indeed, any way i can use this with xfire? just like cod 4... muahahahha!!! but seriously, xfire compatible?"
,Jsramer,2008-05-05T04:04Z,"mekke92=r-tard
Actually check the damn website to see if there are any private servers before you say something like that."
,GaMe_HaCeR,2008-05-12T17:53Z,Seriously dudes.... i cant find an proper Priv server... i just come to some fucking chinese and arabian sites  and shit like that? anyone got a Pirvate server they can post link to?
,lumbix,2008-05-12T19:23Z,seeders? freakin slow...
,Captain_Snowman,2008-05-21T20:33Z,"There are no private servers for City of Heroes/Villains. There is no point to this torrent because the only way to play it is to pay, and when you pay for it, you can download it from  their site anyway."
,flygon90,2008-05-31T22:46Z,This torrent is useless. just go to the site (http://www.cityofheroes.com/trial/index.html) and it will let you play for 14 days and this download + city of villians. There are NO freeservers...believe me...i've looked.
,MrFlawa,2008-06-01T21:09Z,can anyone link a private server becuse i cant find one 
,tIVO,2008-11-21T19:31Z,If any one knows what MMO stands for. thousands of players in one game world. have not seen one free server that remotley can handle thousands of players in one world. moste i have seen before it gets laggy is a few hundreds. a normal MMO have atleast e few thousands of players. and if we look at the game that handles moste players in one game world (EVE-online) we talk about 40.000 players in the world at the same time. if you want to play a MMO and get some out of it pay for it or play the trial that moste MMOs got. i do download mmo´s here from now and then why? i have lost my cd´s or thay got broken. or i have lost the digital download of the game. and one last thing to free servers aint the same game/rules as in the real game. its just aprox of how the servers works. Just my cent...
,magedogtag,2009-04-11T23:48Z,"mbeau, no kidding.  it's not a crack for an online game?  really?  oh my god!!

moron."
,Torrent_Assassin,2009-05-01T05:36Z,the download from the site takes way too long so im just going to get it here. So do I just use MagicISO to burn it onto a disc?
,trophy_monster,2009-06-30T19:50Z,plz can you seed this HS and that r tard is a code for a priv server
,priyatham,2009-07-13T15:47Z,does this game have carrer without online
,Novatoons,2010-05-22T03:35Z,"Ehh I've had a private WoW server before and played with some friends so why should this be more of a problem?
and though MMO stands for Massively Multiplayer Online instead of ""thousands of players in one game world.""(I know it's the same freakin thing just being a prick here xD),
you can still try to make your own server without the thousands of players and remotely handle them all and overload your server.

Don't know if the server setup is the same idea as the WoW server setup but should be the same more or less?"
,Kabishen,2010-06-27T02:19Z,"Is this a real server, or not? http://cityofheroes1.home.ro/index.php"
,Kabishen,2010-06-27T02:22Z,"Never mind, should have looked at it more thoroughly first. "
,Kabishen,2010-06-27T02:22Z,Nvm
,asqalette,2010-09-27T13:45Z,"Thank you!! Now I can download it without using their STUPID, slow client. The only fast client I've ever used is Blizzard's, but that's only because they have an entire server dedicated to downloading the game and patches.
Anyway, thanks so much, downloading now."

16Mb of RDRAM
LOL"
,avelwc,2011-03-22T03:01Z,"Ok. What the guy is providing here is a fast distribution of the game code. The company tacitly encourages you to copy the CD and pass it on to your friends. They make most of their money from hosting the game not distributing the software. The ""Free trial"" is for playing the game. Not for what they let you download. They DO (or least they used to) charge for the CD keys. They actually have a piece of software (or they did) that generates multiple keys for their different games. They do sell that.
Distribution of this games code is completely legal. They save money by getting other people to deal with the cost of distribution and saves them server bandwidth
Hell,  the original seeder could even be a company employee. :)"
,jm1001,2012-03-28T11:28Z,"COH/COV  Is a Free mmorpg  you no longer have to pay for it anymore. your a basic member and have limited access to things such as  you cant broadcast messages or talk to one player directly  and certain out fits and special clothing,weapons abilities and things are only given to  VIP. but you can still exp. 90% of the game free and unlike WoW and Rift  there are no more  10,20,or 30 day trials and they dont cut you off after you reached a certain LVL  i have a lvl 39 tank on the gardian server named black templar knight  also  some things that are blocked to you if your not a vip you can run missions and get like extra costumes,capes, and auras. plus if you do pay for it and you  stop paying for it you can still play  you will then be ranked from a vip to a premium player   and have access to more things then a free player but not everything like a VIP  but you keep everything you bought as a VIP  so every thing you got a s a vip you keep   u just aren't a vip  anymore  get the game its worth playing    and yes im a free player  and i still enjoy the game very much  as a free player. also  city of villians is now city of heroes  in the you have 2 points in the game where you can choose what side you want to play  in tutorial mode at the beginning  it tells you  to save the hero and stay  on the hero side or still his powers and you go to the villians side. later on in the game you can run a mission after you reach a certain lvl  were you can choose to stay hero or go villain or rouge "
