-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The last time we saw Danny Ocean's crew, they were paying back ruthless 
casino mogul Terry Benedict after stealing millions from him. However, it's been 
a while since they've come back together, which is all about to change. When one 
of their own, Reuben Tishkoff builds a hotel with known casino owner Willy 
Banks, the last thing he ever wanted was to get cut out of the deal personally 
by the loathsome Banks. Banks' attitude even goes so far as to finding the 
amusement in Tishkoff's misfortune when the double crossing lands Reuben in the 
hospital because of a heart attack. However, Danny and his crew won't stand for 
Banks and what he's done to a friend. Uniting with their old enemy Benedict, who 
himself has a vendetta against Banks, the crew is out to pull off a major plan. 
One that will unfold on the night Banks' newest hot spot opens up, when the crew 
is out to bankrupt one of the city's most despised businessmen. But they're not 

in this for the money, but for the revenge.
