,Dr. Frikadel,2007-08-06T21:52Z,What's this?
,blankbox,2007-08-06T21:53Z,"doc..u seeing this torrent?
really acting strange this end.."
,borak stiller,2007-08-06T22:34Z,"It's a copy of ZipScan for unzipping CAB files which were in the original not working versions of the VFR England and Wales files.

It downloaded fine the first time, nothing funny at this end.
BTW how did you delete your original torrent?  is there and edit function somewhere or do you just go through the admin.

Notice there is a forum here now with a PM function.  That should be excellent for sorting out some stuff and coordinating stuff."
,blankbox,2007-08-07T01:07Z,...you will see a little red X at the top of any torrent YOU make....thats your clue..saw the forum thanx..but so far a bit lacking.....so flying around Wales and enjoying yet???
,borak stiller,2007-08-07T03:55Z,"Thanks for the tip blankbox.

No Wales yet, still some hangups there and like a fool I deleted my installable image for disk 1 that I already had in the first place from your repair.  That was a mistake and a real dumb one."
,blankbox,2007-08-07T04:26Z,"aaiiiiyaaaa!!...told you guys in the original torrents don't delete...everything you needed was there..!!
Just need the cabs...everything else is just JF fluff.."
,blankbox,2007-08-07T16:17Z,"This method works with...

British Airports - E & SE England (Vols.1 & 2)
British Airports - Central & SW Eng (Vols.3 & 4)
British Airports - Wales & West Midlands (Vol.5)
British Airports Northern England Part 1 (Vol.6)
Roads & Rivers of Europe
VFR Photographic Scenery - Central & S England
VFR Photographic Scenery - E & SE Eng
VFR Photographic Scenery - Wales & SW Eng

...all you need is the cab files"
,borak stiller,2007-08-07T19:27Z,The trouble is that the new downlaod has a CRC error in CAB1 so it can't be extracted.  I'm going to try to download the olderCAB1 and see if we I can get things sorted that way.
,borak stiller,2007-08-08T04:06Z,"Finally flying in England after re downloading the old file and using your instructions and Extractor.
Thanks blankbox."
