Tammi Faye, you were weird as hell, but that's no sin (lucky for me), and in a world of phony TV Christians and right wing power brokers,  you seemed sincere and kind to me, and above all, you had a sense of humor.  Hope heaven is everything you ever wanted it to be.  Jesus is going to want to keep you close by for when He needs a reason to smile.

Like I said, I haven't seen this yet, but I bet it would make a great double feature with ""New York Doll"", an awesome documentary about Dolls bassist  Arthur ""Killer"" Kane.  "
