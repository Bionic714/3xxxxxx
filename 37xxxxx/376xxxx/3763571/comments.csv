,Amelie3,2007-08-05T14:29Z,hello to everyone! this is my first upload and I'm afraid that i'm not seeding very fast. can you tell me how to do it faster. i'm using utorrent. thanx
,wankan,2007-08-05T15:28Z,"Turn off any downloads you may be making (as upload bandwidth will be used by these) .
Then Right click the Utorrent icon near the clock , Left click ""Upload limit"" and left click whatever speed you think your connection may be able to handle . If you have a 1mb down , 256kb up connection for example , then I'd suggest an up speed of 25kbps ."
,Amelie3,2007-08-05T16:04Z,"thanx,its going faster now. how long do i have to seed? i dont mind seeding but i'm downloading something that i'm anxious to see,so when can i start dwnling it again? thanx for help i'm rather new in all this"

,wankan,2007-08-05T19:32Z,"How long to seed ? Good philosophical question .
It depends on the popularity of the media really . If it's popular others will continue to propagate via seeds and mutiple peers ie an aXXo torrent . If it's a rare , slightly unknown torrent , I'd be enclinded to allow it out into the wild , stop seeding once maybe 3 seeders are seen , then move on .  Then restart the seed 3-5 days later to see what's happening and help late-comers from other torrent sites out . Depends how into the seed you are really ."

,zploek,2008-05-17T02:26Z,"Wankan is talking bull shit!!
downloads don't affect upload speeds. they are on separate channels."
