I have yet to find a collection of Swedish music (outside of the Swedish folk musik community), so I made one. There are so many groups and tunes, so I picked the ones I listen the most to for the moment, and those that I think might appeal most to a broader audience, without leavin the genuine swedish folk music field. Thus the collection consists mainly of intresting high energy, up tempo tunes!

This is a collection of the new and exiting traditional swedish folk music that I listen to and play, and that I would want all of you to experience.
