SUMMARY

A Tale of Two Cities (1859) is a historical novel by Charles Dickens;
it is moreover a moral novel strongly concerned with themes of guilt,
shame, redemption and patriotism.

The plot centers on the years leading up to French Revolution and
culminates in the Jacobin Reign of Terror. It tells the story of two
men, Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton, who look very alike but are
entirely different in character. (Summary from wikipedia)
