So First the  set up (and read the readme.txt) and then the oga check"

,EagleTechy,2007-08-12T11:17Z,Has anyone tried the updates? Will it pass Office Update Validation and Windows Update?
,jjohanp,2007-08-13T10:57Z,I've installd everything after the read me but it says that I should enter the product key when I start Word. What should I do?
,blindseyed,2007-08-15T18:25Z,"Sorry, it's like the other 07 Office products. Even with the crack, it stops working after about 25 uses, all features get locked."
,nickofcourse,2007-08-16T05:33Z,"guys i got it installed, but i cant validate it. i guess it has something to do with the install.bat that i run, then it says the system cant find the files specified.

guys when giving me help responding to my username, thanks people!!! "
,nickofcourse,2007-08-16T05:33Z,"update, i also have the oga check in my windows/system32/ogacheck... in there. so idk"
,Apla,2007-08-24T20:41Z,"Hello people,

I've downloaded and installed this torrent.
The validating works fine and the Program starts fast.
If you have a really slow computer then you should not download this one.

Good luck."
,jmar,2007-08-28T01:20Z,Accounting Express 2007 is not included

,wiggy2k7,2007-09-01T14:52Z,This did not work for me. Keeps asking for serial and to activate the product even after using the crack. Im using Vista Ultimate 64bit.
,Bruincdc,2007-09-01T19:48Z,NO Business Conatact Manager or Accounting Express......This is basically Enterprise....
,Maplestone,2007-09-03T03:51Z,Is this the full version?  It's not a trial is it?

,master_69,2007-09-18T07:05Z,more seeders please
,pacmansex,2007-09-20T22:52Z,"Mine's not even validating.
Is the order in which you do the steps crucial? I mean I installed the .bat file earlier than i was supposed to is that gonna make a difference?"
,superstar85ca,2007-10-06T18:16Z,"This is my first software download.  When I run ""instal.bat"", I get the windows system32 folder but I can't copy the OGACheckControl.dll into it.  This is not working for me, I need help!!"
,skunkworks2000,2007-10-18T03:01Z,Hey. This one turns out to be a trial. 2 months in and locked. anyone got a key??
