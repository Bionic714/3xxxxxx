Remember the good old days, when one could follow the internet traffic real easy, and still have a perfectly good way to control it with one little piece of software ? ;) Well, then you have to remember / NeoWatch /-And-/ NeoTrace / Two perfectly good, and stable programs, that had to go down when they so tragedly where sold to McAfee :/ Sad times.... But here you have them, if you would like to try them out .. :) 

Enjoy.
