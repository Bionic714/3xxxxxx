,NrKNrK,2007-08-11T01:29Z,thank-you for this.
,Salustius,2007-08-15T15:34Z,"Another kind of inconverible crap from the UNIX world...

All you leechers, loading this masterpiece, ne warned that you cannot make a standard DVD out of it...

NERO Vision does not accept the file as Input, and so do other programs. 

Uoy are forced to purchase "" River Past Video Cleaner"" for USD 29.99. Tells you it takes 36 hours to acomplish the task. Never gets there, crashes before. No log, nothing.

It looks like the ""Lord-Terabyte"" is, after all not a Pirate, but a Robber Baron. Kind of ""Francis Drake"" reborn, and this is a compliment...."
[T],clownmonkey,2007-08-19T07:28Z,"@Salastius: wow, that's some nice complaining.  How you can accuse trafficking in intellectual property niceties ""robber barondom"" is beyond me, though I do admire the wit.  At any road, NEROVision and other DVD conversion progz would have a problem with this file because -- as the specs say right there -- there's two audio files thoughtfully provided here, the original PLUS the commentary.  All you need to do is use something like virtualdub to make a single-tracked avi, it's pretty simple.  @lord_terabyte: many thanks! keep up the great work!"
[T],clownmonkey,2007-08-20T04:29Z,p.s. The Film Machine handles multi-audio tracked OGM files.  And it's freeware!
[V],lord_terabyte,2007-09-06T21:12Z,"Although I do not knowingly share material of compromised quality, I make no representations as to what you will be able to do with the file once downloaded. I have not yet complained because something I got for free didn't do what I thought it should."
,bobbokrull2006,2007-09-16T21:04Z,A question: does this movie have english subtitles? Thanks.
,codmat,2008-01-20T01:17Z,"Thanks a lot lord terabyte.
I've been looking for this for a long time.
No need for someone to mouth off, just do a little research to find the solution to YOUR problem."
,codmat,2008-01-20T01:22Z,"I meant to ask anyone who has downloaded this if it has English subs embedded or selectable.
Thanks."
,vilis1,2008-06-15T00:34Z,"OK, Here is the scoop about the file.  The format is OGM (first time I have seen this).
It contains a commentary about the movie in english and also subtitles in english.  You can access both using VLC by toying with the settings a bit (not a lot of work).
I am trying to burn it to DVD using CONVERTXTODVD but it does not appear to recognize the subtitles.  I will update this comment when I am done.
In the meantime, thanks Lord Terabyte."
,vilis1,2008-06-15T02:23Z,"OK, the subtitles did not make it to the DVD.  Got to stick to VLC to watch the video with the subtitles."
,vilis1,2008-06-15T17:41Z,Version 3 of CONVERTXTODVD does recognize the subtitles.  Version 2.5 does not.
,raheesen,2008-07-28T23:14Z,thanks...great movie...good quality....interesting format(OGM)...
