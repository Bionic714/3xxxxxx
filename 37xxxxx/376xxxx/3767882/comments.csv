,carv,2007-08-09T22:30Z,ffs RubberTow! Quit upping new stuff until somebody is able to download a complete copy of any of your previous material.  It will take months to get any of this stuff at your current seeding rate!
,GaNjaMaaN,2007-08-10T02:26Z,Your IMDB links never works!!!
,vladic,2007-08-14T17:53Z,"thanks for all your rips of Sidaris movies, i love his work"
,RubberTow,2007-08-19T06:38Z,"My imdb never works because I followed somebodies instructions from one of these torrent sites that said to eliminate the letters before the numbers before posting the number. so that is what I did. All of the missing letters have been 'tt'. so, add tt and you should have it. Also, I keep the torrents uploading until the seeds are well into double digits, so kwitcherbitchin and if you don't like what I'm doing, then do it yourself, it is q"
,RubberTow,2007-08-19T06:39Z,"tp continue, kwitcherbitchin and do it yourself, it is quite easy."
,RubberTow,2007-08-19T07:43Z,"Oh well. Too damn bad. I've downloaded a title for a year before getting it. kwitcherbitchin. Rip your own if you don't like it. Mine are worth the wait. Every RUBrTOE rip is equal in quality to the DVD it came from. Besides, you can blame your leeching buddies, not me. they keep downloading it and then deleting the torrent, the movie and the torrent form their hard drives. It takes at least a week for me to seed it once becuase I got 60 or more leechers on my ass for one file. then it takes another week for it to really take hold and the seeding to multiply into double digits. But if all the yahoo leechers keep delting the  torrent, then it ain't my fault that they don't like the movie or are selfish.
Besides, where's the love? I'm giving the world the best rips possible at the lowest file size possible. How about a little praise for a change."

Good stuff, great quality...
I'll do my best to help with the seeding issue.
I just finished 3 of your torrents (after a week or so) so I will be sure to seed them."
