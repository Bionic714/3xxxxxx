,CleoDeMerode,2007-12-07T21:38Z,"I downloaded this because I was told that this would contain unseen footage of The Cockettes but I was bitterly disappointed. The vintage material has already been seen in the 2002 documentary.
It does however contain very short interviews from a few living Cockettes, that is Scrumbly, Pam, Fayette and Rumi. Also Bill Weber, the director of the Cockettes documentary offers a few words of insight.
This is basically a mash up of old archive footage from San Francisco at the height of the hippie cash in period, scattered with some fresh interviews and imagery from the 2007 Summer of Love celebration. The interviews are originally in english but they have been over dubbed in french.

If you are looking for something a bit deeper about the psychedelic scene in San Francisco, I recommend that you seek out the psychedelic rock episode of the series Dancing in the street (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375293/combined).

If you are looking for more information on The Cockettes, go to their official MySpace site or read Pam Tent's memoir ""Midnight at the Circus"". "
