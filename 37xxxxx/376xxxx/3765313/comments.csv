I'v Burned them with ""Alcohol 120%"" in 8X, it's not too much data.. then I used a Low Speed And Worked Good For Me ... Awnsers In Order
  1- Extract them using winrar, when Extracted You will find a .ISO File, then Burn OPENING the iso in ( alcohol 120%, Dvd Decrypter, Nero Burning Rom),
  2- This is a Ps2 Game no Psone ( Is a Ps2 CD native game ) and require a Modded Ps2 , I DON'T test on ""Hdloader, swap magic, or USB-advance"" if works I don't know... and there are many Ps2 Games Produced In cd by default ( ICO, Street Fighter Ex 3, Okage Shadow King and others I don't Remember )) ... 

Remember ... ""Don't Burn a data disk with the iso File in it... Open the file with a burning program !""
Try to use another version of HDL dumb, I Read in Forums, this game is full compartible with HDloader With No modes ... Sorry For Make You Wait ...."
