This is an excellent sounding show that was webcast a few weeks back. Anyone with more new Velvet Revolver concerts from 2007 please share with the rest of us. Looking for the New York show from this year as well as a non MP3 version of the Buenos Aires show from April 15, 2007. I know they are out there.
