,rh535,2007-08-09T15:59Z,What if you have file maker 8.5 installed. Can you download this and install over 8.5?
,Virtualfx2,2007-08-10T05:01Z,"Don't know if something happened durring download or not, but installation fails with 294 items left to be installed, with a message that the disk is bad. Just before that happened an error occured during the expansion of a pdf file, but the installation continued after that until the fatal error. Any body else have this problem, or should I just download it again?"
