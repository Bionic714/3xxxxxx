:. about .:

looks like a great beat em up game, due to lack of time i wasnt
able to test this at all... 

you can download the sceenshots (included) , to know exactly what
kind of game this is, 

just choose > screen1.jpg and screencover.jpg < and leech.

(using UTorrent, you can choose what files you wanna leech!.)


:. install .:

1.: Unrar with latest winrar and double click on Start-Game.exe
2.: Enjoy!. and happy weekend!




Special Info Note:

Some virus-scanner recognize the header of packed exe's (setup.exe)

as a lame virus, (coz it's the mostly byte by byte check error of 'em!.)

This is truly a false information!,  a so called false positive, you can read 

more about in your VirusTool-Manual or WebSite!.
