!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,kukacjani,2007-08-04T17:56Z,this application has failed to start because d3dx9_27.dll was not found. re-installing the application may fix the problem.
[V],Subzero!,2007-08-04T19:50Z,re-install latest direct x 9.0c... (april version) this should fix the problem!... i hope so....
,Rif,2007-08-04T22:17Z,"An error like that means reinstall DX as Sub mentioned or manually placing the file under SYSTEM.

Also, look for a FULL install of DX."
,Crillie,2007-08-05T00:56Z,It works.. But damn what a sucky game!
[V],Subzero!,2007-08-05T01:24Z,"indeed... but a nice try... there should be more games like this, just a hell of alot more quality would be nice, guess the companies wouldnt make so much money with as they make(?) with rpg or topselling games... and programmers wouldnt earn much bucks with... a dying genre...
