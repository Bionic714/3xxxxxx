Description

O.R.B is a visually stunning 3D Real-Time strategy game that pits the forces of two races against each other in a desperate struggle to control the resources they need to expand their empires. O.R.B stands for Off-World Resource Base and what happens in the Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½Off-WorldÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ is the stuff that dreams or nightmares are made of. Within the multiple systems are the precious resources that both planets desperately need to thrive. The stage has been set for a battle to control the solar system. While the two races play a deadly game of hide and seek in the asteroid belt, they are unaware of a predatory alien menace that threatens the entire solar system.
