,Reconcilliation,2007-08-17T09:34Z,"Haha, oh wow. This has got to be the shittiest engine I have ever seen in a game. I can run Quake Wars in 1024 x 768 with all settings set to max on my 7600 GS and get over 30fps. But O.R.B., a game made 5, FIVE years ago!!! And I can't get above 20fps even running in 640 x 480 with the lowest possible settings in everything.

It boggles the freaking mind."
,deamon2000,2007-08-18T00:31Z,"Reconcilliation
