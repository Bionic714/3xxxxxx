,redhammer,2007-10-10T04:20Z,"I cant get the subs working, no matter what i do, I click, play, then filters, and there is absolutely no such thing existing as directvob sub"
,redhammer,2007-10-10T04:35Z,"Helloooo???? are u there???? I downloaded directvobsub, i downloaded realplayer, i downloaded real alternative 1.51, exactly like in manual, but whenever i go to play, and then filter, directvobsub is simply not there!!!  are u there??? helloOO??"
,hot_soup,2007-10-26T23:34Z,"The subs (in English) worked fine for me so far (but the subs on the Azumi 1 were messed up and I had to edit the timing in Jubler) but the video is really dark and I can't see what's happening in the night scenes.  Otherwise the quality is excellent for such a small file!

If it's not working for you, get the latest K-lite mega codec pack, that's all I have installed right now and it works fine."
,raine777,2007-12-16T00:01Z,Despite what the read me file says this video is blurry and smears and I can't get english to come up on gom player.
,raine777,2007-12-16T00:26Z,nevermind the english is in a special file included in the folder
