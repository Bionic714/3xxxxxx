Avg. Rating:  	
  3.3 / 5 (based on 2 ratings).

Plot:	Taking place shortly after the end of the first film, "Azumi 2" features the same actress, Aya Ueto, in the title role, this time going up against a corrupt government official (Mikijiro Hira) and his team of trained ninja assassins.

Overview:	With Godzilla veteran Shusuke Kaneko taking the reins from Ryuhei Kitamura, Azumi 2 more than meets the expectations of legions of action aficionados in an impressive and entertaining follow up to the Yu Koyama manga favourite, Azumi.

Azumi 2 carries on where the original left off, with expert assassin Azumi (Aya Ueto) and her remaining surviving colleague Nagara (Yuma Ishigaki - Battle Royale II), still following their quest to rid Tokugawa |apan of its warlords and so bring peace to the country. The duo meet up with Lord Tenkai-sama, who recruits them to take out another trouble-rousing government official, the vengeful Masayuki Sanada. In order to protect himself, Sanada recruits a crack team of high tech assassins that Azumi must face in turn before taking on Sanada in a bruising final showdown.

Boasting extravagant set pieces, sublime choreography and ns whose powers verge on the superhero, the key to ni 2 is still the towering performance of Aya Ueto, the late female action hero.
