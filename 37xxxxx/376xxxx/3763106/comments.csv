One quick question though. Is this just your assembled collection or was it from a four disc set (as the track numbers would suggest)? Just wondering as I'm somewhat obsessive about tagging and album covers etcetera and I can't find an Amazon listing anything like it.
It's an excellent collection either way. Thanks a lot. It rocks."
