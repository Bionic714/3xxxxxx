counter strike source complete dedicated server installation

Getting tired of following tutorials that brings you nowhere? Sick of getting those errors when lauching your dedicated server?

Well with this you have a complete dedicated server.

it is cracked and mani admin plugin is included and installed.

some people managed to install the dedicated server using HldsUpdateTool but after that they gave up..... those people suck


details:
- the complete dedicated server folder with everything you need
- srcds is cracked so non-steam players have acces to your server
- mani admin plugin installed and works right away
- installer is around 550MB, when installed it is around 1GB


what else needs to be done?
Open ports so people can see/join the server. You must open alot of ports on your router/modem to let people join your server.

port 1200 UDP
port 27000 till 27014 UDP
port 27016 till 27039 TCP
port 27015 TCP and UDP

portforwarding
