,FernandesVincent,2007-12-28T16:36Z,"Bye, Zookeeper. First I wanna thank you for the great quality of the two Harry Potter's you've posted. I was just wondering if you are gonna post Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban too. It would be great if you did. Do you want to think of it?"
,BoingBoom,2008-04-02T03:07Z,"Not great quality: Very low bitrate audio, it's overall darker than other versions, and it's over-cropped and slightly squashed to a 2.57:1 aspect ratio when it should have been 2.35:1. The torrent's details BTW falsely claim a 1.78:1 AR (16:9)."
