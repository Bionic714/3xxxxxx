? 	"Two Thumbs Up." - Ebert & Roeper

Veering between days of relentless searching and nights of alcohol and 
drug induced extremes, William Keane (Damian Lewis, Band of Brothers) 
teeters on the edge of sanity. He is desperately searching for his 
6-year-old daughter, who has been missing for months. Then one day, 
he meets a financially strapped young woman, Lynn Bedik 
(Amy Ryan, The Wire), and her 7-year-old daughter, Kira 
(Abigail Breslin, Signs). As he becomes increasingly attached to the 
child, the story moves to a whole new level of poignancy and tension, 
especially as it emerges that Keane's daughter may never have existed 
at all. Director Lodge Kerrigan plunges us directly into Keane's profoundly 
unsettled universe, and Damian Lewis' devastating performance makes 
Keane a riveting, complex and deeply humane experience.
