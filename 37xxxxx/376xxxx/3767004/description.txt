A classic action-filled John Wayne western is set into motion 
with a spectacular robbery of a Union pay train by Confederate guerrillas. 
The train's colonel (Wayne) jails the enemy leaders but the three men 
later become friends when the war ends. Together they seek the Union 
traitors responsible for a string of Confederate train robberies, a mission 
that culminates in a rousing shoot-em up finale. 
Rio Lobo was the fifth collaboration over a 22-year period between 
John Wayne and the legendary director Howard Hawks.
