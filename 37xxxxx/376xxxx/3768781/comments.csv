But doesn't anybody have their albums IN BETTER QUALITY?

Very cool band! But hard to find. The next very-cool-and-hard-to-find band after GMM is Darling Cruel. Maybe you have their album ""Passion Crimes"" also? :-)"
,kvestantin,2008-11-15T19:21Z,"As I don't keep music in zip files on my hard drive, I uploaded a torrent with the same album, but track by track in wma.
Will seed it for a much longer period, I think.
