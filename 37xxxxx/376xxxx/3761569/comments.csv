,Spaceparanoid,2007-08-04T15:23Z,"I'm confused... I've been on this since it was uploaded and I haven't got past 7.1%. I see zero seeds and 56 peers in azureus yet TPB claims 1 seed and 24 leechers. Torrent seems to have been downloaded twice, yet no seeds out there.

I suppose what I am trying to say is - could someone please seed this!!"
,chattanooga,2007-08-04T20:27Z,"Seems like that bathurst_guy UL'ed 10 torrents and then just disappeared, 'cause the same goes for the Office package and the OS's.
You can't trust the figures in TPD. They are not in real-time. Probably punched in by some bored sysop to cheat on us honest DL's"
,Spaceparanoid,2007-08-05T00:53Z,"Well, I didn't want to diss the uploader but... This could have a bad smell about it. Let's just hope someone has made an honest mistake and forgot to seed. Feel free to laugh at me for being so trusting..."
,chattanooga,2007-08-05T12:26Z,"You're right. Could be a HW problem or anything....
I'm still at 7.1% with zero seeds and 53 leechers so I better be patient!"
,tannler,2007-08-06T17:43Z,"Incompetence? He might not have it in him to get stuff right. ""Would like to..."" and ""Can"" are paved rather far apart and a 99 per cent success doesn't hoist anyones credit in BabelHouse."
,chattanooga,2007-08-08T00:32Z,"This torrent stinks!
TPB figures: Seeders 1, Leechers 43, DLs 41
My figures: Seeders 0, Leechers 50 and 7.1 %
I've been hanging in for over 2 days. 41 DLs, my ass!
Over and out."
[T],bathurst_guy,2007-08-16T10:05Z,"It's back up and seeding - sorry for the downtime but minor internet issues here.

Oh and by the way --- your all so very welcome."
,Jedih,2007-08-23T10:38Z,"""It's back up and seeding""

Yeah...sure it is!

Could you try pushing the seed-button again?

Pretty please with sugar on top!"

,digi8boy,2007-09-02T06:17Z,"I've finally managed to download, but no serial included. I'll seed and hopefully someone can send me a serial?"

,lin2log,2007-09-24T15:50Z,"Man... what a load of MORONS. 

Gee, if you need it THAT bad that you have to collectively diss the poster, hmmm... try BUYING it?? As he said himself: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, so try getting of your high horses, seed it your OWN fukkin' selves next time or just STFU?"
