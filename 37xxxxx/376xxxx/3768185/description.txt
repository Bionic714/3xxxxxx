They double-crossed Walker, took his $93,000 cut of the heist and 
left him for dead, but they didn't finish the job. Big mistake. He - someday, 
somehow - is going to finish them. 

Lee Marvin is in full antihero mode as remorseless Walker, talking the 
talk and walking the walk in John Boorman's (Deliverance) edgy neo-noir 
classic filled with imaginative New Wave style, blunt dialogue and 
Walker's relentless quest that, one by one, smashes into the corporate 
pecking order of a crime group called the Organization. Angie Dickinson 
plays the accomplice who uses her seductive wiles to ensnare one of 
Walker's prey. "I want my 93 grand," Walker growls at him. Throughout, 
the payoff to that demand is action that "hits like a fat slug from the 
.38 Lee Marvin uses as an extension of his fist" .
