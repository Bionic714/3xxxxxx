How do I install the KFF Library?


To install the KFF from downloadable files:

1. On the Downloads page, click to download the most recent KFF Library File

2. Save the KFF install file to a temporary location on your drive.

3. Double-click  the install file and complete the installation wizard.

4. To use the KFF in FTK, click Tools, then Preferences.  Set a user defined and browse to ADKFFLibrary.hdb in the location you chose to install it.
I dont understand or what Â´s mean whitch ""temporary location on your drive"" can be a usb memory or another  Lokal disk like E or D.?"

After you download go here
http://www.accessdata.com/downloads/current_releases/kff/kff-kff_library_file-27_jun_2007.exe 
and download this. This is library you will need to run that tells the program what to look for (its a database).  
First install the Access Data you download from this torrent. Then run the exe you download from the link from above. Once this is completed take the ""crack"" file that is called ""FTK"" and place it in the C:\Program Files\AccessData\AccessData Forensic Toolkit\Program
Guessing this is where you installed it. 
Once this is complete you are good to go.
Have FUN!!! Forensics set us up the awesome!!111
