It's strange that I haven't had anyone mention this yet. I removed the ISO from my HD a few weeks ago.

I'm really surprised poweriso doesn't open it, that was the app I used to make the image. When it was on my drive, I had no issue using winrar (although for some reason I usually had to open in winrar's file menu or drag and drop rather than click on the file itself).

Has anyone else had issues with opening the ISO?"

,therutto,2008-03-13T09:14Z,This can be mounted with daemon tools even though it's not 100% complete... I guess we need to live with it unless a kind soul pops up.
