Lovingly assembled over the last 7 years, this is likely one of the largest collections of esoteric literature you'll be able to find. Whatever your level of interest in the mind and reality, you will find enough here to contemplate for decades!



INCLUDED IN VOLUME III


- Over 1,000 books/articles/websites/documents taking you down the rabbit hole, through the looking glass and into the Chapel Perilous of labyrinthine conspiracy theorism. Like the subject matter itself, these works are hard to classify and tie into multiple threads at once: UFO, Lizards, Underground Bases, Illuminazis, The New World Odor, Assassin Nations, Spooks, Mind Control, MK-Ultra, Revisionism, 9/11 & Terrorisn't. Included are many primary sources and legal documents regularly quoted by conspiracy authors and in many cases from which theories are devised.

By no means a definitive collection, although a thorough and comprehensive bedrock foundation of conspiratorial thinking.



- Also included are all software & fonts required for all files:
