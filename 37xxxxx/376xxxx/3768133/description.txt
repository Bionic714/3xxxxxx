The complete works of Barenaked Ladies\' Bathroom Sessions as seen on video sharing sites like Youtube and Revver. Each one was ripped from Youtube and encoded in h.264 encoding in an mp4 wrapper, it looks fantastic on an iPod Video or in a small window on a computer (in iTunes). All the audio is MP4 also, so if player can undertand mp4 it will just use the data inside (players like Amarok on Linux which don\\\\\\\'t support video directly). Here is the track list:
