Krusty was comedy rock band in New Zealand in the 90s (http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:kjfexqthldfe). Not sure of the release year of this album (I have the original CD but it has no date). None of Krusty's albums have been available for at least 7 years - if you have one please upload!

320Kbps LAME mp3

P.S. This is NOT the Krusty from last.fm, ignore the "detailed artist info" below
