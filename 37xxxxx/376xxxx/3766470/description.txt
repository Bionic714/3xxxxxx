Plot: Monologuist Spalding Gray spins his brilliant conversational web in this one-man reminiscence (based on his hit Broadway show) about his small role in the 1984 movie The Killing Fields. Gray's musings encompass such varied subjects as Southeast Asian politics and the availability of sex and drugs in the Third World, as well as a few pithy observations about New York City.
