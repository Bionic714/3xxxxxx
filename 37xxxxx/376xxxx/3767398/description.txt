? 	Michael Powell's controversial meditation on violence and 
voyeurism effectively destroyed his career when it was first released, 
but later generations have come to regard it as a masterpiece. Karl Heinz 
Boehm stars as Mark, the son of a psychologist who kept a video 
journal of the boy's upbringing for research purposes. The constant 
intrusions profoundly affected the boy, who grew up to be a photographer 
himself; but his principal subject matter consists of women whom he 
murders before the camera. He then runs the films of his victims in their 
final throes so that he can study their reactions to death--a perverse 
extension of his father's experiments, which tormented Mark to analyze 
his reactions to raw fear.
