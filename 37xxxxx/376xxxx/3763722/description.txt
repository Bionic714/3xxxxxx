Includes the Comic plus an mp3 of the cast reading the comic, and a 55 second promo trailer.

Four direct to dvd movies of Futurama are being made, the first coming out November 27, 2007

In 2008, the movies will air on Comedy Central as sixteen separate episodes. These are not new episodes, just parts 1-4 of each movie.

If dvd sales and comedy centrals ratings are good it is hoped/rumoured we will get even more Futurama
