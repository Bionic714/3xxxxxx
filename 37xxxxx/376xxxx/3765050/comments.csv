,dolphins_fanatic,2007-08-07T19:32Z,"Hey 4X-AXG,

I'm downloading them now. I looked yesterday using the search by typing in Sky Unlimited but they weren't showing. So I wasn't sure they were uploaded yet or not. But all is good now. Thanx! Do you have the others I'm requesting?

,4X-AXG,2007-08-08T01:12Z,"never search for a developers name, just search for 'FS2004' and 'FSX'

I don't have the pack for EAP, and I'll let somebody else upload the Meteor..that's ancient shit, I only upload new stu..eh..shit"
,dolphins_fanatic,2007-08-09T05:36Z,"Hey 4X-AXG,

Well I've always had better luck searching for stuff using the developers name. Seems to make hunting things down a lot easier. At least for me. 

Well if you come across the AGN Superpack for the E.A.P. let me know,or well,upload it! ;) Thanx dude!"
