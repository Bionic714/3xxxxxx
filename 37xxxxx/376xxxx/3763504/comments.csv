,playmobil76,2007-09-27T18:07Z,Problem is solved by turning anit-alising on in the video settings. Do that and it works. :) yuupiii

,gorres,2007-09-28T11:16Z,worked perfectly. thanks guys
,kratersak,2007-09-30T01:26Z,"I'm not sure what to think about Cider: on one hand it's great that games can be ported easily, on the other it means that games are NOT native, but semi-emulated, like WINE. Even though the claim is that frame rates will be maybe 15% less than native, the process of recoding directx to OpenGL isn't a huge thing- it would take maybe 2 months for any graphics programmer worth his/her salt. The big cost for any company that does multi-platform releases is the need for setting up a support apparatus for all platforms, and I suspect that would be true for Cider as well. So if you're releasing games anyway, why not do them native? The cost for a true native release is neglectable compared to support & QA."
,initin,2007-10-06T08:03Z,"Works fine for me.
I was expecting some crisp and shiny graphics but was disappointed. I have tried all options for video graphics in the game.... no change.
Speed is fine....just the basic graphic quality."
,dedser,2007-10-10T00:21Z,"What to do if the game shuts down immediately after i run it? When i run it, my screen just turns black for about 2 seconds and then the game shuts down."

,jakecool,2007-11-21T15:52Z,"no, i don't know...maybe we should wait for someone who is good with cider and remakes another dmg for us"
,jakecool,2007-11-21T15:54Z,"Or maybe you can use it on windows, under Parallels. It should work..Cider uses Wine or similar, so you can download a windows version and play it under win...when i finish my download i'll tell you how it goes."
