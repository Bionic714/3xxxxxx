But in eather case, episodes are missing! How can you then title something like that as ""Season 1-3 Complete"" when it's not? I guess you get what you pay for. And if you don't pay at all you get this kind of crap, so we better get used to it. I will buy the DVD release of this show when it is complete. Right now I'm just trying to catch on the whole story since I didn't discover it until recently.

There are 13 episodes of first Season, 24 of Season 2, 24 of Season 3 and currently 18 episodes of Season 4. I hope Season 4 is not the last season of this great show."
