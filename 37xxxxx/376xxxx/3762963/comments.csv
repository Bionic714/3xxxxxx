,CaptainDDL,2007-08-11T01:52Z,"I hope the main seeder doesn't leave...besides that, the highest percentage any of my peers have is 52.4%. Oh, and from what I've listened to, this is an awesome collection."
,mugwump770,2007-08-11T04:22Z,Doing my best!  Comcast is having one of its moods.  PLEASE seed it when you get it all.
,mugwump770,2007-08-13T15:28Z,"OK,  this has now been completely fed twice,  to 160 people,  and NO ONE is leaving it up.  That's enough.  Too much like Limewire and WinMX have become..."
,began,2007-08-18T12:49Z,"Seed please. 

Tnx."
,mesohony,2007-08-20T18:46Z,"DOWNLOADED 2454 TIMES AND 2 SEEDERS!!! WTF
I know TPB's stat's are not reliable...but comeon !!! peoples
thank you mugwump770 for this upload I've been downloading since the day you put it up and am now at 82.8 % I get about 5% a day now it seems...
Please don't stop now or it seems I won't get the final 17.2%..."
,Barefootplowboy,2007-08-26T02:17Z,Been on 90.8% for the last 3 days...
,svchost_dll,2007-08-26T22:03Z,more seeders plz 
,svchost_dll,2007-08-26T22:47Z,"come on , 2 days with 0kb/s"
,dizzydoc,2007-08-29T05:26Z,"I am downloading and will be leaving my pipe open 24-7 for more seeders... Please, do the same for me.

Cheers, Doc"
,dizzydoc,2007-08-30T01:16Z,"How do I get my upload rate to increase on this torrent? 

Thanks, Doc"
,dizzydoc,2007-08-30T21:44Z,Like others.. I am stuck at 95.2. Does anyone have all of this torrent?
,jonwayne,2007-08-31T03:44Z,"ok this is one of the coolest collections i have ever heard unfortunately it seems that I'm still missing pieces from certain tracks on disc's 20 thru 38, this is such a disappointment seeing how its half the collection corrupted. we just cant have this so please come and seed this fine piece of historical audio so we can all rejoice in the sound of rock' n roll and maybe learn something in the process."
,tokumaru,2007-09-03T04:55Z,"Please, please, please would someone with 100% be kind enough to seed this great torrent for a while? I see so many stuck at 97% and this is a really worthy torrent. 
Please help us old wrinkly farts that love this sort of stuff, and of course everyone else too!!
Many thanks - Toku"
,Barefootplowboy,2007-09-03T06:13Z,"C'mon...if people can seed for you, please return the favor. Don't just get your download and run. Leave it running for others to enjoy also. I need less than 100 Mb over the last 5 days, and have uploaded over 18Gb on this one torrent."
,mesohony,2007-09-03T18:08Z,Mugwump770 this totally ridiculous you put this up Aug the 8th!!! at least 60 people according to my client are stuck at 97.7% I was at 82% on the 20th...Please keep in mind that this is a 6GB file..if you've upload even 30GB only 5 people have would have it...however it doesn't work like that.. 50 people would only have 10% of it...I know you want to share because you put the file up for us...now do the right thing and seed the file so some of us can get 100% and help seed it so it doesn't take a  month to get...BTW that 4577 downloaded is not the # of times its been downloaded thats the # of times this link has been hit. again I thank you very much for making this file available to the community...
,tokumaru,2007-09-04T12:32Z,"Well, some kind soul with 100% dropped into the torrent for about half an hour a short time ago, but BitSpirit showed them as paused, not sure what to make of that. I currently see about 74 people all stuck at 98%, now that's only a few megs left to go. PLEASE someone, anyone, that has this SEED for a bit more than 30 minutes and let us get finished with this excellent torrent. 
If you have 100% of it, let us other 74 leechers have a chance to enjoy it too, seed for a while please.
I say 74, that's all I'm seeing atm, I am sure there's lots more just not connected right now.

Thanks, Toku"
,tokumaru,2007-09-04T13:33Z,"p.s. perhaps some kind person will explain to me the meaning of the paused thing that I see. Is the seeder at 100% actually uploading to anyone or just sitting there?
Sorry for my ignorance, just a question.

,TexasBoomer,2007-09-04T17:52Z,"I have worked in radio for 25 years.  I first heard ""The History of Rock and Roll"" 20 years ago, and have tried since then to get it on tape from the radio.  I've tried to buy it.  I've tried everything!  I did a Google search, and found this torrent.  I did not even know what a ""torrent"" was!  I got the software, started downloading, and was devastated to see it stop at 98%.

I've been trying so hard to get this special for 20 years now.  I am so close.  I really hope SOMEONE that has 100% of this will sign in, and let those remaining blocks get downloaded so we can get a complete file in the swarm.  I am amazed that so many other people want this radio special, and sit here day and night with their computers logged in, waiting for someone to help......

Mugwump, you are obviously an old radio person like me.  I've checked into your other downloads, and they are excellent.  I hope you will decide to help us out here.  Best of luck to all."
,tokumaru,2007-09-05T06:52Z,"Hey TexasBoomer

Good to see another self confessed ""old radio person"" !! I also worked radio, but only a short stint in the US back in '72 on WAMA down in Selma. I have been collecting a fair bit of ""nostalgia"" over the years and would enjoy swapping a few memories if you'd like to get in touch. let me know and we can work it out somehow.

BTW we all seem to be at 99% now, patience may yet have it's rewards. Please everyone keep seeding if and when you get this.

Toku"
,marre102,2007-09-05T17:50Z,seed
,mesohony,2007-09-05T19:27Z,29 days and counting...almost there...woohoo!!!
,TexasBoomer,2007-09-07T08:04Z,"Thank GOD!  It took forever, but we finally were able to get the full torrent!  Mugwump did an incredible job with these files, as they are stripped as MP3's at 320kbps.  They are pulled as separate sections, just as they aired on the radio.  The commercials would have played in between these individual cuts.  He has even included the album art as a jpg!  The cue sheets are even included to tell you what each of the cuts included!  Incredible.  As I stated earlier, I have been trying to get this radio program for 20 years.  Now, I have it, and it is perfect.  Thanks to all involved....Now, I am off to enjoy listening to 38 hours of the legendary Bill Drake!"
,TexasBoomer,2007-09-20T19:03Z,"You don't get the point, or know what this is then.  This is not supposed to be a ""collection of songs"".  This is a RADIO PROGRAM.  It was not recorded off the radio, it was stripped from the CDs that are sent to the radio station.  The radio program has the announcer telling you ""the history of rock and roll"", and playing the songs that he talks about.  If you are just wanting a collection of music to fill your ipod, then do not download this.  If you want to learn the history of rock and roll, including historical interviews of the artists, and lots of information, plus great music, then this is for you."
,Eric de Noorman,2007-10-23T19:29Z,"Hello all, - Nearly finished downloading after 1 week. Thanks to all seeders - taking a break now, but  I'll seed as much as I can !!! Take care ! EdN. "
,doubleclick98,2008-01-03T05:55Z,"I've been listening to this for a few days now, out of everything I've downloaded from P.B. this has got to be the best I've ever. Have a hard time stopping can't wait to continue listening to it.
The quality is phenominal well worth the time to download it.
Great job!!"

,bradshaw1,2008-03-13T14:39Z,thanx.
,Timeleft,2008-03-27T06:34Z,"Please, please, those of you that waited so long for this excellent torrent; don't let this die! Remember how badly you craved this and how long you waited, and how much others want for this.

I rarely seed because I simply can't spare the bandwidth, but I WILL seed this for as long as possible when I get it all."
,iados,2008-06-23T13:04Z,wow!!! Thanks for the upload and to all who continue to seed.
,615694,2008-09-01T05:42Z,"Without a doubt something to listen to when traveling and no stations come in except C&W.
I prefer R&R"
,eGorian,2009-02-02T02:27Z,"thanks a lot for this great release! it's sounds fantastic! i love this songs. i love that time! i love it!

,RickBob,2009-05-08T04:17Z,How do you seed?  I have no clue.
,chrisdiack,2009-06-15T02:06Z,"This is probably the greatest Rock and Roll history of all time.  Mugwump770... Thankyou for this amazing musical expose, and the extraordinary effort you have gone to, making this available.  I'm in the broadcast industry, and have a keen interest in this sort of material.  Is there anything else that comes close to this in production quality and effort... if so, love to hear about it.  Well done, Mugwump770!"
,kaneala,2009-11-24T12:31Z,"Disk space galore, bandwidth unlimited. I have many of these as individual pieces of Billboard years but not as a collection in one place.This one goes until nobody wants it any more ? and then a year or two longer. Thank you, very much."
,mdilley1,2010-07-21T03:52Z,"I am new to torrents and am unsure how to do this. I am interested in the History of Rock & Roll, both the KHJ version and the Bill Drake version. I heard them both years ago on radio and would like to download them but am not sure how to do it. Can someone help? thanks"
