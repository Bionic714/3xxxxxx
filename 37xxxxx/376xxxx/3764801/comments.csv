,fastbel,2011-09-17T20:53Z,"For splitting tracks I've used Nero but it is time comsuming and does NOT automatically split at 'track change' (maybe every 5mins/10mins or whatever you select???). I used Nero Express - add the track/album then go to Properties/Indexes, Limits, Splits/ then 'mark' where you want to split (put marker).... and basically there is where you can do what you want. It's been a while since I've used it but hope this helps. "
