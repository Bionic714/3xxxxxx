When young Alexis Love enters the Academy, she finds herself trapped 
in a silent institution of dark perversion, blossoming sexuality, 
unspeakable secrets and strange occupants. Will our heroine become 
their plaything? Bizzarre hardcore and twisted psycodrama mark this 
great Gazzman feature.
