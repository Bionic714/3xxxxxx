,DOIPhotos,2008-09-15T03:05Z,"Ummm...that's why it says ""spanish"" in the Spoken Language category lol. That and all the info is in spanish....yep....espanol!!!"
,teladoy,2009-08-26T18:20Z,"OK it does say Spanish but it should be more specific.
Their are great spanish movies in espa単ol.
Their are great foreign movies destroy by dub.
Their are american movies in spanish (doblada)
So it is confusing even for me that my primary lingua es espa単ol.
That why subtitles are so good because they don't destroy other peoples hard work."
