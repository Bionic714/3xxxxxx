,vivatpb5776,2011-03-27T05:06Z,"Wow, where to begin...

The video quality is fine. Definitely a quality DVDRip. There is no green image or division of images.

The audio is not out of SYNC (not sink for the illiterate noobs out there).

Overall quality is:

V- 8.5/10
A- 9/10
Movie- 7/10

Thank you uploader."
