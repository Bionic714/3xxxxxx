Nicholas Angel is the finest cop London has to offer, with an arrest record 400% higher than any other officer on the force. He\'s so good, he makes everyone else look bad. As a result, Angel\'s superiors send him to a place where his talents won\'t be quite so embarrassing - the sleepy and seemingly crime-free village of Sandford.

However, as a series of grisly accidents rocks the village, Angel is convinced that Sandford is not what it seems and as the intrigue deepens, Danny\'s dreams of explosive, high-octane, car-chasing, gunfighting, all-out action seem more and more like a reality. It\'s time for these small-town cops to break out some big-city justice.
