,TwistedInc,2007-08-22T06:14Z,"It's no problem. I watched it all the way through and there's only about 2-3 spots where it skips for about .05 of a second, so it's no big deal. Great quality. Unfortunately, I forgot to have my Azures open for the past 3 or so days, so I'm going to seed till the end of the month. Cheers."

,baswell,2008-01-31T23:08Z,"Not sure how people judge this ""great quality"". :(

Video is a tiny 594x244, audio is only 112KB/sec and the codec is XVID, not x264.

Why do people downscale from DVD resolution and use anything other than the original AC3 audio?

Nothing to see here, move along people..."
