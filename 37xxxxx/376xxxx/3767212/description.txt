A parody (made by a couple of my friends) of the hugely famous show Jackass. Or well, that\'s what they called it, anyway. The first couple of seconds contain a couple of lines in Swedish, but the rest is purely random things, as well as some jokes you might not get because you don\'t know us. 

On a final note, the clips were shot a couple of years back. And some parts of it are pretty lame... Anyway. If you\'re sitting there, having nothing better to do, just download it and watch it. It\'ll only kill some time, braincells and possibly your grandma, but hey, sacrifices must be made, right? :P

Enjoy. Or well... Watch.
