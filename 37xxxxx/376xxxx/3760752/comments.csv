But I fixed that by increasing MFT to a size-up 9.68 times larger by running Frag Shield."

,pilatuspilot,2007-08-31T16:34Z,"Thanks for sharing this. I've heard of this series and will likely share it at one of my Triple9 weekends this autumn.
By the way, it is amazing the number of idiots who go into a thread on a file they have little to no interest and note their objection to the contents. Why? Who gives a shit about if they don't want to download a file?
That only shows how immature they are. Nothing else. That behavior is very telling.
If I'm not interested in the subject of a downloadable file I wouldn't even bother to read about it, let alone take the energy to post a comment. If that were the case there's about 99.9% of the files on this site that would have a comment by in their thread.
When I see those comments I remember the poster's name and imagine that person with a dunce-cap as high as the apex of Mt Fuji.
This share is very much appreciated, ParCoord."
