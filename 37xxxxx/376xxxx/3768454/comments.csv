And please seed people !"
,jphn37,2007-11-08T11:15Z,"Sorry, I should've made a sample file. It's a TV rip, but of really good quality. The first episode has one blip near the beginning, but it isn't repeated again for the duration. Whoever this DaRmEtH guy is deserves a lot of credit. Compiled here in one torrent for your viewing and downloading pleasure."
,leapfrog,2007-12-11T10:31Z,The files are in AVI format & I'm unable to play them on my Windows media player.  Any idea what AVI codex is required to play these?
,leapfrog,2007-12-12T09:51Z,"Downloaded various codec packs & got it working OK, thank you."
,filifjonka,2007-12-29T00:42Z,"either try VLC or Gom Player, both work fine!"
,svikke94,2008-01-03T20:37Z,"Do anyone know where you can find swesub to this one?

Är det nån som vet var jag kan få tag på svensk text till denna?"
,roflontex,2008-01-11T16:41Z,"The sound and picture qualities are not good. I did not like this version at all, they just skipped the whole childhood in ten to fifteen minutes!

The book of Jane Eyre consists of three equally important parts, the time before serving mr Rochester (childhood), time serving mr Rochester as a home-school teacher and the time after Eyre left mr Rochesters service. As I have read the book several times I have to say this mini series is more than disappointing. 

It's funny how they always use same actors in British TV and movies. 

Torrent is realiable, no viruses and seeds well. I had no problems getting it working with BS player. "
,kasette,2008-05-26T12:38Z,"Please seed! I have to be able to entertain myself now that I'm sick. Please, please seed."
,sanjam,2009-05-30T17:35Z,"This is the most beautiful thing I saw in a long time, and who care if they skipped a peace of Jane's childhood. They had only 4 episodes to do, not ten! The actors are superb.
I loved it and watched it so many times. You will not regret it. Thank you so much for the download. Now seed people. "
