,hollylindin,2009-11-17T22:08Z,"Hey, is there any way you could put up the torrent for only episode 1.51 or just send it to me?  I have had to download the entire first season three times because I keep having nothing but problems with episode 51 - it keeps blacking out around 8.15 and shuts down VLC!  I thought I'd found a good copy and burned a DVD of it, but the audio and video stopped syncing on the DVD.

Would it be possible you could put this up, for little ol' me?  ;)  Any suggestions are welcome as well.

Thanks!"
