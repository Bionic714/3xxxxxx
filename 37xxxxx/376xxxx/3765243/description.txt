Exact duplicate of 2007 Bonus Disc, but with the video scaled and enhanced to 720x480 16:9 widescreen.

I would say that if the 2004 DVDs are 100% these DVDs are surely 97%.

There's a Huge improvement over the image quality of the original Bonus discs.

This might be the best version of 100% original footage we will ever get.
