,crankyslap,2007-08-02T23:10Z,"Yummm I still love this game :D

If you think the graphics are too crappy for you to enjoy it, take a look at our board to find out how to give the graphics a HUGE boost by Enhancing the OpenGL Renderer, downloading a High-Def Texture Pack and a LOT of other improvements using ''Shifter''"
,Tiggertea,2007-09-19T15:59Z,"first: how do i burn it to a disc?
second: does this work on Windows Vista?"
,vickei,2007-12-07T22:03Z,Real and working. Had a problem that it froze after install but other than that it's fine. Thank you!
,Diablojoe420,2008-03-09T18:01Z,"One of the best games ever made! I personally have no problem with the graphics, but where would someone find this ""boost"" or your ""board""?

I'd like to see this game remade with more detail one day. Not only does it combine so many great elements of gaming, it is a prediction of things to come! "
,Diablojoe420,2008-03-11T00:32Z,"Ok I just finished downloading this thing and it just doesn't want to work right.

I've installed it properly, I can -play- it.. but not without really sluggish controls and movement. Terrible visuals (discoloration of the walls, some objects aren't visible, people move extremely fast) A little help?"
,looking54,2008-03-21T12:32Z,"This game does work on windows vista , i have played and completed all endings , using a amd duo 1.7 with an nvida graphics card laptop , works well on high graphics , title screen is missing the bottom wording on a resolution of 1280x800 but still looks best at 800x600 . loading times is super fast and also saving times , didn't have to change compatility settings , some users using duo intel processors may need to use a image config program found at there website for it to work in multi-threading mode , also best used opengl selected from the settings program as i found it really speeds up the quality and motion of the graphics better then dx10 did . thanks for sharing "
,Artuir,2008-05-02T06:36Z,cd packed with spyware/adware bullshit. i wouldn't bother with this image.
,XenoSphere,2008-06-10T05:57Z,Works for me.
,justgoing,2008-06-12T12:54Z,"Thank for a great game!

great upload!"
,Carlevin,2008-11-04T00:52Z,"Having an issue with all versions I have downloaded, it freezes when it tries to decompress system files and the process System File.exe hangs while trying to extract the Effects data."
,Strwbrry,2008-11-28T22:34Z,Can someone confirm that this is clean?
,criteria192,2008-12-02T03:33Z,"Anyone having the problem where the game's install freezes at Uncompressing Data Files, You have to go into task manager and to your processes, and in order, end the processes SystemFiles.exe, TextureFiles.exe, MPMaps.exe.

This should let you continue through the installation and successfully complete it. Happy playing guys!"
,easye7,2008-12-04T06:36Z,"I received these error messages when I attempted to play.. the setup runs just fine, but I recieved this error message at the very end of the installation.. 

ZIP damaged: file C:\DeusEx\System\DeusExSounds.u: Bad CRC 36e72617 (should be 8e4afdd0). Possible cause: file transfer error. 

Then when I try to select the Play option, I get this..

Can't find file for package 'Engine'
History:UObject::SafeLoadError < - UObject::StaticLoadClass < - Init Engine


What am I doing wrong? I really want to get this working, I loved this game on PS2 but alas my PS2 is no more..thanks guys"
,easye7,2008-12-04T06:38Z,Scratch that..it's asking for a CD? Anyone got a good crack?
,addka45,2008-12-05T19:16Z,^-- try gamecopyworld.com for cracks
,jackjessejames,2008-12-18T03:07Z,clean works perfect mounted it with dameon tools
,Optoer2,2009-03-02T17:35Z,"@Tiggertea
First you need a good iso burning software like poweriso (google poweriso download it should be the first one) install it then open poweriso (restart if you want, you don't have to because we're not mounting the file) then press open and go to the folder you saved the iso in and it should come up. Dont click anything on the disk!. Insert a blank disc and select burn, select the writing speed (x4 is supported by most CDs) and click burn."
,Porgos,2009-03-13T01:30Z,"http://cwdohnal.home.mindspring.com/utglr/

That page contains much improved OpenGL renderers, the latest for Deus Ex is 1.9 (for game version 1112fm) Use the new renderers, you'll thank me later..."
,xplanet,2009-04-08T18:31Z,"You can find HD graphics upgrade for Deus ex on following sites:

,peteophile,2009-06-16T18:06Z,I'd much appreciate an upload of a version already given the graphics boost.
,Bambam12349,2009-06-22T09:41Z,"uhm... ok, I'm not good with this stuff it appears.

I got 

Deus Ex GOTY.mdf
Deus Ex GOTY.mds

and a file called ""visit yahha"" or whatever, but that doesn't seem to be part of the game itself obviously.

But what am I supposed to do with these files? How do I make them work?

Sorry for being a moron about this stuff"
