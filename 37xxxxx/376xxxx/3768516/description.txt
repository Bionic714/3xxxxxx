This is one of my favorite old games. It seems to scarcely exist anymore even on the internet so here it is in all it\'s glory. The company that made it seems to have vanished off the face of the planet.

Story
---------------------------------------
An extremely talented and ambitious physicist named Stephen Novotny, who previously worked for a top secret state program, now dreams of world supremacy. He launches a project of his own in the field of spatiotemporal transformations, based on the unofficial results of stolen governmental investigations. The climax of his project will be the creation of a miraculous Time Machine which will bring him absolute power.

The Machine is almost complete; it is already able to create chaotic shifts in time and space. Yet, to become fully functional it needs upgrades and adjustments. Stephen\'s budget has run dry, and he realizes that he cannot continue to work on the project alone. So, he decides to find a partner. He recalls T.J., his one-time pal with a rather dark past.


At the moment T.J. is serving a life sentence in prison for terrorist action. The scientist understands that a villain like this perfectly fits into his plans. Novotny uses a super-tank - one of his hi-tech creations - to rescue T.J. from prison. In return T.J. must become Novotny\'s right hand man and do all dirty work needed to upgrade the Machine to the best of its capabilities. In addition, T.J.\'s role is to terrify the world, bringing destruction to the most important life centres.
