,electroacoustic,2008-07-12T10:54Z,"mongeese, burn CD or mount in virtual CD/DVD or just unpack to HDD ;)"
,Gyroon,2008-07-26T18:24Z,"Very good torrent!
No virusses etc.
If you looking for the crack: you have to open the GPRun.exe file. There's a keygenerator in it ;)

I recommend this torrent to everybody who needs the latest guitar with rse, but without all the crap."
,hitiuga,2008-09-01T19:28Z,"Hey dude, this is actually my first torrent i've burned the onto a blank CD-R


Is it vista compatible? because when i click file to open my computer just freezes up."

,slashnpage,2008-09-18T11:36Z,"Sorry for my bad  english.
I just download a blank file and I need a program to read the file.
But I don't know witch program would be good."
,electroacoustic,2008-09-18T16:33Z,"slashnpage, mount in virtual drive (I recommend Daemon Tools) or burn on CD by Nero (or similar tool). If you want to extract files, you can use PowerISO or similar tool"
,slashnpage,2008-09-18T17:42Z,"It's still a blank document.
I'm used working with a apple macintosh, so this is new for me.
Downloaded the file (it was blank).
What should I do next?"
,electroacoustic,2008-09-19T17:58Z,"But this app is for Windows only, not for MacOS."

,bookie-92,2009-05-30T17:04Z,"Every time i try to install it i get an error that says it can't move the file (whichever files installing at that point). It says it's being used by another process. You can select Abort, Ignore, and Retry. When i used to click retry a few time it would work but happen again for another file a couple seconds later but now its not working at all. Can anyone help me?"
,electroacoustic,2009-06-03T19:35Z,"@bookie-92, which one file? Installer do nothing special - just unpacking files. Something may be wrong with your W$. Try unlock resources with Unlocker (install and then use on folder with problematic file)."
,aznfitor,2009-08-07T09:52Z,"hey i downloaded it and then burnt it on a disc.
Ive only half installed it. I can see the desktop icon but wen i try and open it it asks for a USER ID and KEY ID. wat is it?"
,electroacoustic,2009-08-23T12:26Z,"@aznfitor, just click licence generator button in launcher."
,TheMetalUpYourTrash,2010-01-18T05:29Z,"Hey, I just downloaded the torrent. Everything seems to work but where do I go to enter my username and key ?"
,Ronbert,2010-02-24T20:50Z,"Step by step for installing Anti-Virus software won't let you. Install the Guitar Pro 5 as is when you get to the final screen UNCHECK the run after closing installation.

Now navigate to the iso and open it with a program similar to Winrar and double click on the EULA file in there it is a generator. No matter what your virus software SAYS this file is 100% clean.

I've been using it for months so I know it's clean and safe. "
,Ronbert,2010-02-24T21:04Z,"Okay to fully clarify last post (sorry for shitty english wrote in a hurry.)

1. Mount ISO and instal
2. Uncheck the box that says ""Run after Instal""
3. Open the ISO with winrar or equivilant program
4. Double click ""Resorces"" folder and run ""gp5eula.exe""

Don't worry it isn't a virus it's 100% clean."
,trollking,2010-08-13T16:46Z,Thanks for the upload! Works great!
,vegathemega,2010-08-26T18:13Z,"great downloadspeed thanks! BUT i got a problem. There is no sound. I open the program and the usual annoying ""guitar solo"" plays, but when i play tabs or songs ive made myself its total silence. anyone got any tips for how i can solve this? thanks"
,youthanasian,2010-09-25T10:46Z,Nice seed. Good work!
,tayl0rbelle,2010-11-26T03:52Z,"@vegathemega I know that I have a problem with the sound not working sometimes because my sw synth auto-mutes. Right click on your volume control and make sure your ""SW Synth"" isn't muted or turned down all the way. That's all I've got."
,d3rrick95,2010-12-14T04:02Z,"Hi Im kinda confused with all of this, how do I download it? I get an ISO file and when I open it it sends me to Express Burn, so do I have to burn the file to a disc, or convert it? "
,sixxflesh,2010-12-14T23:52Z,Superb torrent. Safe and well seeded. Thanks a lot.
,killakulo08,2010-12-16T04:21Z,"Good torrent, but, RSE won't work for me. It's grayed out, as if it's not available, even though the RSE folder is present in the place where Guitar Pro was installed."
,welcmet,2011-01-01T12:03Z,"@killakulo08

Go to the RSE folder on the CD and run the files inside it to get the RSE. This installs them, and should then work."
