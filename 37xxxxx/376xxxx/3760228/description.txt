   * "Incredibly fun game! I can't stop playing it! I love the effects - especially when you complete a line, the line crumbles apart. I can hum along with the songs, and I love the new interesting shapes!" - Jenny Miller, Tetris 4000 player

In the classic Tetris game mode, there are several variants that make the game interesting but don't detract from the basic premise. If you get in trouble with your stack, press F8 and a large rubber bomb will knock out all the unneccessary pieces. Also, there are new random blocks that fall that will make your game very challenging. Occassionally a bomb will also drop to help clear away some of the clutter.
