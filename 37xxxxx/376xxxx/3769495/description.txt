Plot: Writer/director Brian De Palma "maintains a fever pitch from start to finish" (Leonard Maltin) with his "steamily libidinous and extremely bloody thriller" ('Newsweek')! Starring Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson and Nancy Allen (in a Golden Globe-nominated performance), this taut psycho-sexual chiller is razor-sharp tale of passion, madness and murder that's as "scary as the devil [with] suspense to spare" ('Playboy')!

Fashionable Manhattan therapist Dr. Robert Elliott (Caine) faces the most terrifying moment of his life, when a psychotic killer begins attacking the women in his life (Dickinson & Allen) - with a straight razor stolen from his office. Desperate to find the murderer before anyone else is hurt; Elliott is soon drawn into a dark and disturbing world of chilling desires. And as the doctor edges closer to the terrible truth, he finds himself lost in a provocative and deadly maze of obsession, deviance, and deceit - where the most harmless erotic fantasies... can become the most deadly sexual nightmares!
