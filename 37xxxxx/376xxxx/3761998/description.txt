German ratings board USKâ??which you may know better as the Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolleâ??has revealed the name of one of Blizzard's upcoming releases, World Of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King.

The expansion has been rumored to explore the frozen continent of Northrend for some time, with leaked documents lending more weight to that speculation appearing earlier this week.
