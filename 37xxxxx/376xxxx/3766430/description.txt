Plot: A stylish and faithful adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's classic short story. Narrated in first-person by James Mason, the main character calmly tells of an unnatural revulsion with his landlord's "strange" eye that leads him to murder the landlord and hide his dismembered body under the floorboards of a rooming house. Sticking closely to Poe's remarkable portrait of madness, the film makes extraordinary use of abstract design and (originally) stereoscopic 3-D depth to heighten the suspense and insight of the story.
