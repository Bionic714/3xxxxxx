,Dont_Taze_Me_Bro,2008-03-19T06:03Z,"It appears that the program is copy-protected. If you attempt to analyze any commands that contain the aisc code it refuses to create a design.

Any help with this?

Also, does anybody know where I could find Staad.etc 4.0 ?"
,rajugaadu12345,2008-05-30T22:12Z,"thank you very much for the civil engg software 
thankx alot im downloading now"
,pinecooler,2008-06-30T23:34Z,"Can anyone get this to perform an AISC code check?

I keep getting an error saying that the license doesn't support it"
,Blirr,2009-01-21T21:08Z,"The license problem is very easy to fix. Go to start/all programs/staad.pro 2007/select licence tool/Staad select xm licence configuration/ and open the program. Here you can pick and choose which codes that shall be used, then just click accept. At least it worked for me with the scandinavian codes.

But i have another problem. The program and crack works fine on my laptop, but i cant get the crack to work on my stationary. I guess the problem is that i have Vista x64 on my stationary. The crack is a registry edit, and to me it looks like everything is at the same plase in the registry. But i doesnt work... Any idea how to solve this???"
,korvakarva,2009-02-10T18:26Z,"Hiya pals,
Can you tell me how can I install this program. I've already installed the license tools and when i try to install the program it asks me the registration keys or something and wont let me install before they are correct. What should i do?"
,7up1974,2010-04-23T12:07Z,"Hi,

Why there are many zip folders containing same file. I used only one zip folder to install the software. Is it ok?

Also I was not able to work in Interactive Design modes. Kindly help."

,battuck27,2010-08-20T00:37Z,"thanks for the upload, but i can install it even though i follow all the instructions. i install the license tools but during installation it is looking for the bentley eig license services."
,omnarayan,2011-02-21T10:39Z,"Hi Blirr,

Were you able to keep this running on your x64 system? I'm having the same problem with activation. Despite the crack, it says I only have 15 days left for trial. Does the crack only work in x86? 

TIA!

,adamsawi,2011-03-09T10:05Z,how about staad tutorial
,amendaleerfef,2011-05-20T03:57Z,"for those on x64 systems you have to change the registry editor file. open it with notepad, do a search and replace.
search: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE
replace: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node"
,cindy2077,2011-11-09T02:08Z,"Ty amendaleerfef, worked perfectly! (W7 x64) 

I recommend that everyone with either Vista/W7 follow amendaleerfef's instructions. Lond live Team MAGNiTUDE/LND! (whoever you are, I love you)"
,cindy2077,2011-11-09T02:12Z,Also ALWAYS RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR (right click - run as admin) when following the instructions when using W7. Otherwise it won't work.

i realy need this program "
,Chidomex,2011-12-29T17:20Z,"OK People here are what i did to make it work at windows 7 64-bit...

1.- Mount *.bin or *.cue with deamon tools
2.- OPEN Bentley IEG License Service folder and run de setup, then open Data1.rar and run ""bappmon.exe"".
3.- Open MAGNiTUD folder and run spro2007 file with note pad then you have to replace all the ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE......"" for
""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node......""

Then run the fucking program...

If it does not work you may repeat step 1 and 2...

Hope it works for you...

,Darby31,2012-07-30T18:23Z,"I cant get it to install...
There are three things I cant work out using the tips of previous users:

1) There is no data1.rar file ...only a data1.cab file... ?

2)Bappmon.exe  does not seem to do any thing

3)When you open the spro2007 from the disk image, it is not possible to save it, so this has no effect??
Can anyone help?"
