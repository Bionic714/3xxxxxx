,Davidbeats23,2008-04-11T02:55Z,nothing special. dont download this.this is jerk.
,ojmccon,2008-05-08T01:25Z,"Well, she is a bit strange but extremely confident and not at all unintelligent. Sane and sensible just does not describe her at all IMHO. For that, try Nikki Fatale or Lady Julia. 
Be careful, however: MoH does try to put a financial squeeze on her listeners - or subjects, as she calls them. She styles herself Queen Kathleen sometimes. Folie de grandeur perhaps. Thanks for the upload, Bedrog."
,ojmccon,2008-05-08T01:29Z,I'm sure I have a little of this lady's video material. Can upload if there is any interest.
,darkness1234,2008-05-18T19:25Z,"Oh yes please do upload them OJ, that would be awesome!

And thanks for these bedrog!"
,kinkyinbots,2008-06-21T11:06Z,"For hypno fans I rather enjoy the material at Warp My Mind.  Can't remember the url off-hand.

And ojmccon - good reviews and thanks for the tips on money extraction!"
,chorus1468,2008-07-08T23:26Z,I have her whole catalogue how do would I go about sharing? 
,oralfixation,2008-08-08T08:01Z,"chorus, I really hope you can upload those. I love LOVE moh's work more than anything, but I am horribly crippled by poverty (can barly stay online). "
,oralfixation,2008-08-08T08:13Z,"i can only get this file to come up in a google search, not a search on here. I wonder how many other MOH files might be like this for me? or anyone else have this problem? "
,bobbknight,2008-12-17T06:08Z,Does anyone know anyone who can seed the 7.35 GB Hypnosis torrent?
