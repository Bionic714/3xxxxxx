Plot Outline:
Popcorn is a teen comedy about getting the girl, losing the plot and the problems you face when you turn to films for inspiration. Movies may influence life but, as Danny finds out to hilarious consequences, rarely in ways you could ever anticipate.*Starring Jack Ryder, who became an overnight household name and won himself a legion of young female fans by playing the part of Jamie in BBC1's `EastEnders'. Jack constantly topped the polls as the nation's favourite soap character.*The film also stars Jodi Albert, who is perhaps best known for playing Debbie Dean in teen soap `Hollyoaks', although is now enjoying a high profile as `Hayley' in controversial brothel-set sit-com `Respectable'.*As well as featuring the super model Sophie Anderson in her feature film debut.*Other cast members include Andrew Lee Potts (Primeval), Luke De Woolfson (Stoned), Kate Maberly (Finding Neverland), Laura Aikman (TV's Mysti), Ophelia Lovibond (Oliver Twist, Nathan Barley) and Lee Williams (Teachers).
