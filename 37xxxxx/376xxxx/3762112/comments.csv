,ysc1020,2007-08-05T08:17Z,"JamesKees, how can I reach you?  I have some questions about an old Kung Fu movie I want to find."
,valedor_one,2007-08-11T13:17Z,"Anyone else than me who can't get subs? I suspect that there are no subs unless they're inbedded/hardcoded and I can not find any indication for it.

James, your efforts in the kung-fu movie world are very much appreciated. Thank you."
