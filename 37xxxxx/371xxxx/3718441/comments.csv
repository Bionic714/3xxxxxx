,Yurn2,2010-02-07T12:22Z,"Thanks for this, this stuff would be very difficult to find these days and I doubt it'd make it to Bluray or even get remastered."
,Yurn2,2010-02-08T07:01Z,"To Watch use your average media player such as MPC-HC:

Open MPC-HC>File>Quick Open File>navigate to and open VIDEO_TS file... see what happens.

,Yurn2,2010-02-10T22:02Z,"This is likely to be a VHS or VCD sourced conversion to DVD. Poor quality, very similar to the quality of a modern-day Cam-in-the-Theater rip, lol.

You've got to think about it. These days people think the quality of Cams/TS's are pretty bad but it's as good as you'd get on retail VHS/BETA back in the 80-90's, hahaha. Back then you'd be happy with that quality too!"
,ScrubbyScott,2010-03-04T07:58Z,"haha Yum2 I've still got a BetaMAX Player, RCA Select-A-Disc CED Player, LaserDisc Player and Video8/Hi8 Player along with todays Common BluRay, HDDvd, DVD Players and VCR.. 

Wished I could find this in ISO format, when played in VLC and jetAudio there appears to be a DVD Menu... I passed this up at MovieStop cause I thought WTF Why not just download it and save some money and it was a DVD for those who were questioning the format and if it was a ""cam"" LoL @ CamRip's in 1987 wow Back To The Future anyone? "
,8ttavious,2011-08-09T05:28Z,"A very poor transfer.  I did not get all the parts, but I did watch one .VOB file that completed, and the quality looks like a VHS transfer at a low bit-rate and interlaced with choppiness.  

Was this a bootleg someone made of the VHS before the DVD came out?"
