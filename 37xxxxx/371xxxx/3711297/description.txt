Out of print soundtrack to the 2001 Bogdanovich film "The Cat's Meow," starring Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies, Eddie Izzard as Charlie Chaplin, and Edward Herrmann as William Randolph Hearst.  A mix of authentic 1920's period tracks (Al Jolson, Paul Whiteman's Charleston) and modern recordings of period songs.  A must have for 20's music enthusiasts.
