,nskrill,2007-06-21T14:14Z,"How to install Leopard with only single layer DVD media

OK, I have just created a bootable copy of the Leopard install DVD using the following method:

1. Open the Leopard installation DVD using Disk Utility.

2. Using the Disk Utility, create a new dual layer (8.5GB) sparse image called leopard (actual filename will be leopard.sparseimage) and mount it.

3. Restore the Leopard installation DVD to the mounted leopard.sparseimage (not the image file.)

4. Open the mounted leopard.sparseimage with Finder, and delete the XCodeTools directory.

5. Unmount the mounted leopard.sparseimage.

6. Using the Disk Utility, create a new single layer (4.4GB) spare image called boot (actual filename will be boot.sparseimage) and mount it.

7. Restore the leopard.sparseimage image file to the mounted boot.sparseimage (not the image file.)

8. Unmount the mounted boot.sparseimage.

9. Burn the boot.sparseimage to your single layer DVD media.

Booting from this DVD works, but takes a long time."
,drrules,2007-06-21T16:24Z,"joec411 you can install it onto any harddrive and then just select that drive as the bootdisk

Okay step by step

1. Download the dmg (I'm going to call it leopard.dmg)
2. Plug in your external harddrive (I'm going to call it newdrive)
3. Open up Disk Utility
4. Click on newdrive
5. You'll see ""First Aid, Erase, Partition, RAID, Restore
6. Click on restore
7. You'll see two fields Source: and Destination:
8. For Source: select leopard.dmg from wherever it is on your harddrive
9. For Destination: drag newdrive from the Disk Utility drive list
10. Click on restore (It might take a while if you're using USB... maybe a few hours, just let it go)
11. Leave this new harddrive with leopard attached to your computer
12. Open System Preferences
13. Click on Startup Disk
14. Select newdrive with the Leopard Install
15. Restart the computer
16. Leopard install begins
17. Install it where ever you want.

When I installed it I wiped my main harddrive because I wanted to have nothing on it to interfere.... this is a beta after all. I backed up all my stuff and I'd suggest you do the same.

If you're using 9A410 be warned that it is EXTREMELY buggy. I haven't used 9A466 yet still downloading it.

Goodluck and if you need anything else ask away :-)"

That might be fine, it should let you as long as you don't click on reformatting the drive as well. It's an OSX thing, it may and it may not. Logically it should, but since it would be installing on the same ""drive"" it might not. I can check for you within the next 24 hours and I'll tell you."

I have no idea what you mean by crack Disk Utility. This is a utility included in every version of Mac OS X. It is located in your Applications Folder then you go to your Utilities folder.

If this is not what you mean, please expand on your question.

rupal
I haven't finished downloading this myself, so I'm not sure if this is a valid copy of 9A466. It sounds like you're missing a bit of information though. Try keeping the file in your download folder and running your torrent program again it'll verify the file and if it accidentally said the file was completed when it wasn't it might rewrite what was missing

jaco3700
From what I can see it actually will NOT let you install onto the same harddrive even if it's a different partition. (But my USB drive is a little messed up, so you may want to try it anyhow)"
,sporkguy,2007-06-22T16:27Z,"I can confirm that this is the real deal, it works 100% on my Macbook Pro (fresh install) and my iMac G5 (upgrade from 10.4.10).

the way I did it was the same as I did with 9a410.
I repartitioned my external hdd with iPartition leaving me with two partitions... One being 10gb in size.
I then used disk utility to restore the leopard DMG to the blank 10gb partition.

then reboot and press and hold the option key, select the leopard install partiton on the external from the boot screen and there you go :)

good luck guys, it's pretty easy!"

,gou.dedalus,2007-06-24T19:16Z,"Experiences with this build (on a 17"" iMac C2D):

I didn' tried any trick mentioned earlier here, just wrote the image to a DL disc with Disc Utility. First, I tried to update my Tiger system, but after the installation, some elements were missing (Stacks, Quicklook button...). So you should definitelly make it as a fresh install.
After the system started, I tried to install the Additional Package (or what...) from the DVD, but it fucked the installer every time I selected X11 & additional fonts. Xcode installed fine, thou.
Finally, I installed some additional software: elements of iLife '06, Photoshop CS3 (starts a bit faster now), Flip4Mac, Skype etc. Everything's working. The iLife programs had their update atomatically. First start, the system is slow, as is with every new Mac that haven't been updated in the store. After a bit of use, everything fasten up.
This thing contains a new version of Frontrow, but I didn't really play with it. It has a new look, a bit simpler.
I couldn't try Time Machine, 'cause I don't have an external HD (for this).
A new stuff presented in the keynote work fine, althou there are some minor glitches, but nothing serious. All in all, the system feels stable, the performance is about the same as with Tiger. Coverflow & Quickllok is COOL for previewing docs, pictures and videos, as long as you only have MPGs and MOVs.
Worths a try. If nothing goes wrong, I'll use it as my main system until the final version comes out. But, if you want Mac OS experience of release quality ( :) ), stick with Tiger & wait for october."

* No optional ZFS :(

* Time Machine doesn't work, when I click backup now I see -- ""An error occurred while creating the backup directory."" (mind you I'm trying to backup to the same volume as installed on for versioning, maybe it works with external storage).

* Net Info manager is gone! -- Directory Utility has some of the functionality, rest you need to use the the terminal and the dscl command

* Can't get auto NFS share mounting to work with Directory Utility -- keeps saying ""The volume for ""data"" cannot be found. Insert the disk or connect to the server volume and wait for it to appear on the desktop, then try again.""

* Dock needs a bit of polish, sometimes animation not smooth and moving icons in the dock sometimes makes them vanish -- also dropping new icons on dock sometimes doesn't work.

* Hate the new Dock blue dots that show the application is running, difficult to see them.

* Expose not very smooth

* Bluetooth doesn't work -- I was not able to pair the mac with my phone failing at different stages  in 3 retries with 3 reboots.

* Can't use isync with phone because bluetooth doesn't work -- in previous beta ical isync didn't work -- seems to be getting worse and worse when it comes to PIM.

* Sometimes quicklook doesn't show preview of content and you need to switch view to make it work again.

* Fails to resume from suspend on a Macbook Pro Core Duo!"

 * Time Machine works like a charm once the initial backup succeeds. Seems to be making backups about once an hour, but I can only tell that by the timer in the sys prefs, it doesn't take lots of performance or anything.
 * Yes, all animations are dog-slow... Lots of debug code in there, I suppose.
 * Sleep/Wake works without a hitch on MBP rev1
 * Stacks are neat but need more work. Doesn't work as expected wrt drag&drop at times.

@23joecool:
Don't have CS3, but Photoshop CS works.

Application incompatibilities:
 * NewsFire is buggy. Prone to crash at launch because of a feed auth window that can't be interacted with properly. Doesn't work well with the Safari 3 engine, posts are sometimes completely un-styled.

2. I named one partition Mac OS X Install DVD and the other Macintosh HD 3 (The # of HD that it was), but you can name it whatever you want.
3. Do what some of the others have suggested, and as a source, select the image, and as the destination, one of the partitions on the HD that you made.
4. IMPORTANT: You MUST check mark the box that says erase destination or it WILL NOT WORK.
5. Restart your computer holding down the option key and select the partition of the HD with the copied image.
6. Go through the installation process and install on the other partition.
7. Reboot your machine and you should be good

10 Cliquez sur Restaurer (Celà risque de prendre beaucoup de temps si vous utilisez l'USB...peut etre quelques heures, laissez le juste faire)
11. Laissez ce nouveaux disque dur avec Leopard relier à votre ordinateur.
12. Ouvrez Préférences Système...
13. Choisissez Démarrage
14. Sélectionnez newdrive avec le logiciel d'intallation de Léopard
15. Redémarrez votre ordinateur
16. L'installation de léopard commence
17. Installelez-le où vous voullez.

Il dit que quand il a installé Léopard il a néttoyé son disque dur principal car il voulais que rien n'interfère...après tout c'est une BETA. Il a sauvergardé toutes ces données et il voudrait vous sugérer de faire la meme chose.

Si vous utilisez la version 9A410 faites attention car elle est EXTREMEMENT buggé. Il n'a pas encore utilisé 9A466, il est toujours en train de la télécharger (comme moi).

Bonne chance il propose son aide je fais la même la chose.

,the.truth_is_out_there,2007-06-29T18:49Z,Here is what I did to make this work. I first mounted the .dmg and ran it through disk utility and   verified the it passes. I then used disk utility to burn it the image to a DL-DVD. Make sure you let Disk Utilty verify the burn process worked. After that I was able run the installer and or boot from DVD suing the C key on start-up.

When i did it MAil 3.0 tells me that an ""importation"" folder was created but i see nothing.. and Mail 3.0 bugs so i need to force to quit... An other problem is the trash that seems never empty and when i click on ""empty"", the Finder bugs and relaunch... So my question is : does the DL version works better ? thx for your answers, and sorry for my bad english."
,courben,2007-07-08T16:58Z,"Hey It is me again,
Some quick tips:
Do not upgrade your old version of Mac OS X.
You would have to zero out your hard drive and then install it. That should make it work.
Mail has some minor bugs, nothing terrible.
Other than that I haven't seen any major problems.
if you have any questions I can answer I'll be glad to help"

,courben,2007-07-09T20:04Z,"Ok,
Did you restore your drive the way it is explained in the previous step. If you didn't do the whole thing (restore and all that).
Once this is done, restart your computer holding the option key pressed, it might take 30sec but do this and you should see two drives appearing on the screen your computer's and the external HD. Boot from the latter one. it should work perfectly.

To see if you mounted the image correctly on the HD, open the HD up and it should look exactly as if you had introduced the Apple CD's that came with your computer."

Working fine... but not what i expected!
I don' find all features that shown on their Website YET (well i believe that because of Beta!!!) and some iLife softwares as well! (i just realize it!)...

It took around 15-20min to boot from DVD (as mentioned in previous post how to Fit in Single Layer DVD!), but install only took around 10 min.

Applications crash often and... when i click on Date/Time it take some time to show the Drop-down options!

i recommend that, serious users should wait for final release... lucky i installed on External FW Disk!!!

anyway, in this release you wont find anything fancy or wont even feel the different! other than Keyboard shortcuts are changed! ...

thats all for now!
