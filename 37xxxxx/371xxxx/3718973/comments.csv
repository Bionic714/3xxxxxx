For Nintendo DS

PS This has problems with the DS-X Flashcart.

Love Auyx 8-)

Not the first-ever dual-screen Zelda game (that honor goes to the foldable Game & Watch Zelda system), nor the first action adventure in the series to use two screens (Four Swords used the Game Boy Advance to GameCube link cable to pull this trick), The Legend of Zelda DS is the franchise2s first outing on the Nintendo DS handheld.

The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass is designed in the style of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. The game features similar cel-shaded stylings for its 3D engine, with traditional top-down gameplay (using a hovering and semi-mobile camera in a locked perspective) and a map along the bottom screen.


Features:

- The stylus makes controlling link easier than ever. Tap on the screen to make link move or sweep the stylus around him to swing the sword. Players can even draw a path for his boomerang and send it flying into hard-to-reach targets

- Players can stash the map on the top screen for quick reference or drop it to the touch screen to make notes, study enemies or chart a path for their boat to follow while they man the cannons

- Compete with a friend over a local wireless connection: guide link through special dungeons to capture the triforce or command the forces that oppose him less"

,X-Fi6,2007-06-26T00:28Z,"There's a better one at IsoHunt. More descriptive, fixed, and in RAR format. I'm seeding it for you guys, too. The owner of the torrent is also using the Pirate Bay tracker. ;)

,Shaflugi,2007-07-03T02:04Z,Is there some way to run this game on a GBAMP?
,darien174,2007-07-03T05:32Z,"X-Fi6 your file doesn't work. it's either corrupt or in a different format my DS-x card won't read it and neither will my nds emulator which has played this from this torrent.
