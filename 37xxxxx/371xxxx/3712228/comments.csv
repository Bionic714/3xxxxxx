,Panodilo,2007-06-13T11:00Z,"The other day I was flying on Vatsim into Charles de Gaulle in a 767. I was having such a good time and my yoke kept rubbing against my member. Unfortunately that pleasure was brief. When I selected my assigned STAR the EFIS displayed, to my great dismay, a clutter of lines that looked like a fucking Jackson Pollock painting. I had the latest AIRAC for the Level-Dick 767 and the mess in the EFIS didn't match what I saw on my urine stained charts that I had printed at the copy shop down the street. The AIRACS, as I understand it, is more of an update for the airways and not the airports. No matter where I intend to fly, I find myself going through the AVSIM library for the correct SID/STARs. This deprives me of valuable time. Time that could have been spent enjoying the splendor of Thumbzilla's she-male galleries. But that is outside the scope of this torrent. This is a vital addon, and I thank you."
