Want to seriousl;y improve your fiddle playing in general? This is the tape. Whatever your level you'll benefit from 'A Fiddler's Guide.' I can't recommend it highly enough."" -- Paul Brown, Old-Time Herald

Student Review: 

I have looked at several fiddle instruction videos and I can honestly say that your video has taught me more and I have improved my playing faster then any of the others combined. Your relaxed and non-rushed way of instruction is just what I needed. You go over every song in detail but not in a complex or confusing way. Nor is it so slow and basic that it is boring. 

I especially appreciated the way you start each song note by note in a basic format then go on to make it sound beautiful with the fills and ornaments giving me something to strive for. I hope if given a chance you make a ?Waltzes, Airs and Haunting Melodies? Part 2? - Ron in WA State. "
