,Diverinblack,2007-07-14T14:27Z,I believe the same setup file does both PC & MAC versions
,LordSkyFlash,2007-08-02T16:10Z,Can the full torrent be seeded?  I'm also stuck at 75%.  THX
,sd2005,2008-03-05T06:09Z,"txs diverinblack, hope it still works! if it does I seed a bundle"
,bmnrocks,2008-04-24T00:37Z,Is this one the same as http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3698698/Padi_Rescue_Diver_DVD
,bmnrocks,2008-04-24T18:27Z,How about an XVID rip of this DVD to save a TON on bandwidth.
,ett2tre,2009-04-16T14:09Z,"bmnrocks: As far as I can tell, this one contains the ""Pro"" video as well as the ""Diver"" version. The other torrent seem to only contain the latter.

Anyway, thank you diverinblack for the upload! If we ever get the latest DVD where I work I promise to upload it :)."
