Series following Paul Merton as he travels through China. Paul heads to futuristic Shanghai, the commercial capital of China, where he plays golf, has a suit tailor-made and meets match-making parents. He experiences the city's nostalgic side at a 1930s dance hall and dines with a group of socialites, before rounding off his trip with a visit to a bizarre recreation of an English town - complete with empty houses, deserted streets and a fake Gothic cathedral.
