The season debut is a behind-the-scenes documentary about the filming of \"Medellin\" on location in Bogota, Colombia. On the set, Eric and Billy clash over keeping the film on schedule and Billy develops an infatuation with Vince\'s beautiful Colombian co-star that becomes increasingly disruptive to the production. Meanwhile, Drama tries to angle for a part in the film, and Ari provides color commentary from his LA 
office.
