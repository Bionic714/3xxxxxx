,Moze,2007-06-20T06:15Z,good quality sub? or just another fastsub with bad quality?
,Osaka,2007-06-20T07:10Z,"@ Moze

you can't think? or are you just too lazy to use your brain?

English subtitle file ( .ass )
by Fujin + Zols


for: [RAW] DEATH NOTE - 36 D-NTV (704x396 x264).avi		

Also, if you're refering the the quality of the translation, the file is 31.73 kb... if you can't get off your ass and download 31.73 kb and check for yourself, then HOW the HELL did you manage to write a comment? Must've been absolutely exhausting for you."
,Moze,2007-06-20T11:24Z,"now what the fuck is your problem?
i simply asked if it was a good sub or not, and since i dont have the raw yet, how the fuck can i check it in 5secs?

another note, cant seem to find the correct raw, you have a torrent/irc/dd link?"
,Osaka,2007-06-20T11:44Z,"Geez, try searching: torrentz (dot) com/search?x=0&y=0&q=death+note+36+NTV

You seem to be new to the internet. But that's ok I guess. Only reason I'm helping out is 'cause I'm bored right now."
,Osaka,2007-06-20T11:50Z,aapparently you need to add www in front of torrentz for it to work correctly..
,Moze,2007-06-20T12:35Z,"Thank you, beeing helpful wasnt to hard was it?"
,NGCaptainM,2008-02-05T07:52Z,lol @ Moze
