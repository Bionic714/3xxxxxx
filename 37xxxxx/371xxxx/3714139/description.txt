Here's the long awaited video of the world first downing of Illidan Stormrage by Nihilum, on the 5th June.

It contains the entire fight from start to finish from the points of view of Muqq, one of our shadow priests, and Clinkz, our warlock class leader.

The video is in the high resolution of 1680x1052 at a bitrate of 4mbps for the best possible viewing experience. Streams are streams, and won't give you the same level of appreciation of the fight that the full quality downloads will.

The video is encoded in the DivX codec, which can be found at www.divx.com. Further more, if you have problems playing the video back smoothly because of the high video quality, try closing all background processes to free up some of your system's resources (if you can run WoW anyway you should be perfectly fine).

Sit back and enjoy the fight!
