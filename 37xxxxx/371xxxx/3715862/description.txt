Overview: The lovely Michelle Mei Suet, star of "The 36 Crazy Fist" and "Ten Tigers Of Shaolin", plays a spoiled girl who ignores her true love to go off in search of a swordsman she idolizes. That sets the stage for one great action scene after another, until she's about to be sold into slavery. If you want to bet that her true love arrives in the nick of time, you'd be a winner...as is this amusing and entertaining variation on the standard kung-fu film.
