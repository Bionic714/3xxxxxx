Synopsis:
The Carters are an all-American family on their way to California when their car breaks down far from civilization in the remote southwestern desert. But they are not alone: Watching from the hills is a very different kind of clan, a family of marauding inbred cannibals with an unspeakable taste for human flesh and monstrous brutality. In the nightmare that follows, what depravities must this wholesome family endure to survive? And in a primal wasteland ruled by lust and rage, who will become the most shocking savages of all?
