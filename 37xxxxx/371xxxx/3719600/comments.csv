,JestaGeek,2007-06-21T01:17Z,"Thanks for sharing, but I think I'll wait till after it's been officially released for a while. The point-oh versions are headache enough that I've even stopped trying to get them early at all... I can only imagine pre-release headaches! ... But have fun, guyz! ;-)"
,Sergiobw,2007-06-21T01:23Z,"JestaGeek, you are talking about Mac but you are thinking to Win !

,platano21,2007-06-21T04:19Z,All DVD players can read a DL DVD. Most movies (if not all) are on DL DVDs. It is NOT POSSIBLE to get this onto a DVD. Its not a video that you can compress to make it fit. Its an operating system. Search on the internet and you'll find ways to install this bad boy without having to burn it (for those of you without a DL DVD burner).

Also, if you are going to mount this .dmg or are going to burn it.  Remember : DO NOT UNLOCK THE IMAGE.   Unlocking the image will render it prett much useless.

TPB designers -- would you consider putting a ""preview"" button (and perhaps an -edit- and -delete-) in the comments?"
,lenrique,2007-06-21T05:05Z,"INSTALATION:
1. Open the Leopard installation DVD using Disk Utility.
2. Using the Disk Utility, create a new dual layer (8.5GB) sparse image called leopard (actual filename will be leopard.sparseimage) and mount it.
3. Restore the Leopard installation DVD to the mounted leopard.sparseimage (not the image file.)
4. Open the mounted leopard.sparseimage with Finder, and delete the XCodeTools directory.
5. Unmount the mounted leopard.sparseimage.
6. Using the Disk Utility, create a new single layer (4.4GB) spare image called boot (actual filename will be boot.sparseimage) and mount it.
7. Restore the leopard.sparseimage image file to the mounted boot.sparseimage (not the image file.)
8. Unmount the mounted boot.sparseimage.
9. Burn the boot.sparseimage to your single layer DVD media.
Booting from this DVD works, but takes a long time.

Leopard WWDC07 Developer Preview Release Notes

System Requirements
To run Mac OS X Leopard, you must have a Macintosh computer with:
- An Intel processor or a PowerPC G4 (800 MHz or faster) or G5 processor
- A DVD drive
- Built-in FireWire
- At least 512 MB of RAM (additional RAM is recommended for
development purposes)
- A built-in display or a display connected to an Apple-supplied video
card supported by your computer
- At least 7 GB of disk space available, or 12 GB of disk space if you
install the developer tools

If you see a message in the Mac OS X Installer stating you do not have
enough disk space to install Mac OS X, you can deselect items to save
space. To deselect items, click Custom Install in the Easy Install
panel.

Known System Limitations:
- 15"" 1.5 Ghz PowerBooks and 17"" 1.67Ghz Powerbooks sometimes panic or
hang when waking from sleep. A fix is available for these two machines
via Software Update.
- Case sensitive HFS+ filesystems should not be used with this beta release.
- iCal alarms sometimes don't go off at the correct time.
- Safari crashes if you control-click on text in a PDF document rendered inline.
- Audio CD playback is not working in Front Row.
- If you are developing or testing resolution independence with a
non-1.0 user interface resolution factor some standard controls may
draw incorrectly. Some applications, such as Finder and System
Preferences, for example, exhibit this problem.
- Texturing in 64-bit applications, such as Chess, results in graphics
corruption with NVIDIA graphics cards.
- Pairing with a bluetooth device will hang System Preferences. If you
have the bluetooth menu extra on, all of your menu extras will also
hang.
- iChat video effects are not working on systems with integrated Intel
graphics, such as the MacBooks.
- If you experience problems launching Terminal after migrating your
user settings, try moving aside
~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist
- If your applications stop launching, you may be experiencing a known
issue. If this is the case there will be a crash log in
/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/, and you will have to restart to resolve
this problem.
- Setup Assistant shows an error dialog when connecting to wireless
networks even though it succeeded.
- If you create a peer-peer network in Leopard, then enable Internet
Sharing in the Sharing preference pane, you can't switch to another
wireless network until you disable Internet Sharing.
- If your applications stop launching you may have encountered a
system daemon crash which will be reported in
/Library/Logs/CrashReporter. Restart to workaround this.
- 12"" PowerBooks sometimes panic when waking from sleep. This is not
fixed by the Software Udpate that resolves panics/hangs on some 15""
and 17"" Powerbooks.

Known Application Limitations:
- Microsoft PowerPoint crashes viewing slide shows.
- Sign-in does not complete with MSN Messenger 6.
- Google Desktop installation fails.
- Adobe Photoshop can't open files managed by Version Cue.
- Adobe Reader 8 crashes in license agreement screen.
- Macromedia Studio 8 does not install.
- Matlab 7.4 crashes on launch.
- Mathematica 5.2 hangs and/or crashes on G5.
- Software Update may not present Aperture Updates.
- Undoing video effects in Final Cut Pro and switching sequence
settings can lead to graphics corruption on systems with ATI cards.
- Movies imported in 1080i with Motion 2.1.2 look corrupted in FCP.
- Motion Templates do not display images in FCP.
- Network Templates do not show up in the FCP's Master Template Browser.
- Exporting from Soundtrack Pro will fail.
- When using Retiming Controls in Compressor/Qmaster, only settings
with AIFF or MPEG for audio will be encoded.
- In Compressor/Qmaster, using Brightness And Contrast, BlackWhite
Restore and Gamma Correction filters will produce unexpected results."

,camelwalk,2007-06-23T20:49Z,"Thanks to jonahan for the upload!  Works great on my Macbook Pro!  The tracker is down and that is why it shows only a few seeders/leechers.  Truth is there are thousands of people seeding/leaching this torrent. What you need to do is d/l a BT client that uses DHT and enable it for this torrent.  I am using Utorrent version 1.4 and with DHT enabled I see all of you!  

I installed using an external Firewire HD- install was fast and flawless, no need to lock the .dmg.  Below is how I did it:

- Get a external firewire drive
- With Disk Utility format as MAC OS Journaled.
- Create two partitions (6GB in 1 and the rest in the second paritions).
MAKE SURE YOU CHOOSE OPTIONS WHEN PARTITIONING AND SELECT 'GUID PARTITION TABLE'
- You should now have 2 firewire drives on your desktop.
- Rename the smaller drive to 'Mac OS X Install DVD'
- In Disk Utility choose the Mac OS X Install DVD drive and click 'Restore'
- Drag the image from the torrent and place onto Source
- Drag the firewire mac os x install drive into the destination. Click restore.

Once finished goto Settings/Startup disk and choose the install dvd firewire drive.

Mac will restart and you will able to install Leopard onto the 2nd partition on your firewire drive.

HOPE THIS HELPS!!"
,camelwalk,2007-06-23T20:54Z,WHOOPS!  CORRECTION From my last post- When creating both partitions the 1st partition should be 8GB not 6GB.  sorry about that!
,balahir,2007-06-23T21:41Z,"Can confirm everything camelwalk noted, including no need to lock the image. Running perfectly on my MacBook Pro. So just take it easy folks and wait for the download to finish, then follow the instructions here, it's really easy. Installation took less than 20 min. It's a funny mix of English and in my case Swedish, about 80-90% is translated so far...

,Bradf0rd,2007-06-23T21:50Z,"Just stopped d/l with Azureus and resumed with uTorrent, d/l speed went from ~30KB/s to ~80.

Obviously the tracker is down(?) so we're relying on DHT. Unless I'm mistaken Azureus uses it's own proprietary DHT, where as other clients (eg, uTorrent) use the standard.
Using a client other than Azureus will hook you up with more peers at the moment."
,Asymov,2007-06-23T22:14Z,"For those wanting to download this--use uTorrent or if on a Mac/Hackintosh, use Tomato.  And, DO NOT turn your computer off (the tracker will go off and when you try to resume your download, you will have problems).  I used uTorrent (since BitTornado only offered me paltry download rates), and left my computer on for about 60 HRS before it completed the download.

Peace."
,Asymov,2007-06-23T22:22Z,"BTW, I've left my copy open via uTorrent.  However, I've placed some setting for port forwarding, but my upload rate doesn't go above 45kB/s.  (I'm using ZoneAlarm--since I refuse to turn off my Firewall.  Nevertheless, I've given uTorrent permission and have set a static IP address, to no avail.)

If anyone can point me to a guide or give me some directions (in plain english, that is), to do port forwarding properly, I'll be more than happy to comply.

I believe I have a bandwidth of at least 380kB/s just sitting here."

,danz013,2007-06-26T13:45Z,"I installed on an external hard drive... to do this, create two partitions on a disk using disk utility, one for the leopard installation stuff, on for the space u want to use the operating system on then use system prefs to make the startup disk the leopard installation part of the disk.

I also then used leopard as my primary IP for a day, this was really really buggy, but it was a really nice system anyway. If you do this make sure you back up your system first because you will want to revert back at some stage unless you can bear the bugs."
,mukamuka,2007-06-26T15:03Z,"PowerPC computers - booting from USB external disk 

1. follow camelwalk's method except when partitioning - indicate apple partition map 

2. reboot with your USB 2.0 disk ON (and with mac os x install dvd on the first partition of your usb disk) while holding OPTION

3. choose mac os x install

4. installation starts OK - but be careful because you won't be able to install it on the second partition of your usb disk. you can install/upgrade your internal disk though. I stopped at this point so feedback would be welcome if somebody has managed to go any further..??

Leopard Installation Method
Here is my method for installing Leopard Beta alongside Tiger on the same physical internal drive.?(this method works on intel based macs only)
1. Partition your hard drive with Bootcamp. (non-destructive partitioning)?[I gave about 30GB to Leopard and left the rest of my drive to Tiger.]
2. Reboot your system with the Tiger installation disk in your drive holding down the ""c"" key.?Use the Tiger installation disk to run ""Disk Utility"" instead of Leopard Beta Disk (more reliable utility)
3. After booting from DVD in Disk Utility select your newly created partition in the left colum?then goto the Erase Tab. Make sure Mac OS X Extended (Journaled) is selected for the new Partition format?and click the erase button in the lower left.?(Doing this erases the Windows formated Partition and creates a Mac OS formatted partition in it's place.)
4. Now reboot your Mac with the Lepoard WWDC 07 disk in and run a full installation on your newly created partition.
This dual boot method has worked flawless for me. ( you do not need it to licked )"

I don't want to be stuck at 91% for an hour.."
,Electric_Blue7331,2007-07-25T04:41Z,"After a bit of use, I can say that this OS seriously rocks and apart from a few minor crashes is fairly stable (I don't recommend trying to play and videos with codecs quicktime doesn't come with, nothing bad happens it just doesn't play and VLC or w/e crashes).  Contrary to some other people's experience Firefox works brilliantly as does Adium and pretty much everything except non-Apple video codecs (I'm sure once the VLC crew gets going all will be well in this respect again).
For video, my experience has been that if Quicktime will play it there's no problem if you need a different player all bets are off.

My installation was quite painless on a Core Duo ""BlackBook"".  

First, I prepared my external USB hard drive by making a 10GB partition  (the size is not important 10 is just a convenient number). I made sure to lock the partitions before reformatting, not sure how important that is but I had zero problems so I recommend it.
Second, I replaced my 15GB bootcamp partition with a blank Mac OS Extended(journaled) file system leaving Tiger intact.
Third, restore the Leopard dmg to the external 10GB partition.
Fourth, reboot and select the leopard install drive either by holding option while restarting or letting rEFIt simply detect your external drive then boot to it.
Fifth, follow the instructions of the installer. I opted not to install the printer drivers, or any additional languages mainly to save space.
Sixth, reboot when the install finishes and enjoy Leopard's goodness.

To go back to Tiger select your Startup disk from the System Preferences.  If you have rEFIt this will ""re-enable"". When Leopard is the start up disk it bypasses rEFIt. 


If the final product is this good I will definitely shell out my cash for it."

No, your CLIENT IS INCOMPATIBLE.  You're not banned.  You said what your problem was in your post.

If you're too stupid to figure out an obvious error message you have no right downloading torrents or installing operating system betas."
