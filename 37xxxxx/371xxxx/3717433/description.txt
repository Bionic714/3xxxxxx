You know you\\\\\\\'re in for something utterly revolting when Steve-O is on the case. As soon as he appeared on screen on any particular episode of Jackass, you knew you were about to see something nasty. Now this guy has his own little video and I have to say that it\\\\\\\'s been a long time since I\\\\\\\'ve let anything on a screen sicken me to the point where I actually retch. There\\\\\\\'s a point where he goes to some backwoods community type deal where it seems the locals favor the taste of rodents. I\\\\\\\'m talking squirrelkebabs, stewed possum and other sordid entrees. It\\\\\\\'s hilarious to see him actually eat these things with a perplexed look on his face. You can literally break the scene down into levels just by the expressions on his face. It\\\\\\\'s easy to tell just what he\\\\\\\'s thinking when he takes a bite of squirrel. It\\\\\\\'s a lesson in mind over matter where the mind wins by TKO. And then the vomiting begins, to the point where the possibility of an internal rupture is very real. The rest involves him doing equally stupid things such as jumping off the top of a speeding car over the side of a suspended freeway into the ocean, setting his head on fire, diving off of hotel roofs into swimming pools, driving a car with the backseat full of ignited fireworks, ice skating on some really thin ice wearing only a tutu and a g-string and much more craziness than you\\\\\\\'d probably care to see. And that\\\\\\\'s without having mentioned the other part of this video, \\\\\\\"The Career Ender\\\\\\\", which defies description. I don\\\\\\\'t recommend this to any kids because they\\\\\\\'re probably stupid enough to want to copy this guy. If you can watch something and suppress your urge to follow suit, then by all means go ahead and watch this. It\\\\\\\'s the perfect display of what certain individuals do when they have a little too much extra time on their hands. Nevertheless, it\\\\\\\'s never boring. Rating (based on shock value of course): **** out of *****. (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0312633/)
