,ilive4harleys,2007-10-12T07:39Z,Thank you. Anything with Tony Williams is great. He and Billy Cobham along with the great Ron Carter and Herbie Hancock are the greatest rhythm section of any band or solo now or ever. T W died way too early. He is sorely missed and as a drummer I can say he was and still is an inspration.
,summer1967love,2012-01-29T02:23Z,"I agree with the other commenter, that Tony Williams plays with utter command, precision, prodigious technical virtuosity. Billy commands the largest stage, but Tony sounds more fierce sometimes, like on the record....thanks, man."
,RedHotCoolJazz,2012-02-13T05:35Z,"I agree with the others about Tony. Seeing him play live was a revelation, either in jazz or fusion as in Lifetime. There are none better.
That said, this isn't one of my favorite albums. You can listen to some clips on amazon to hear before you d/l
