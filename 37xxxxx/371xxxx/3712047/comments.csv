,Seboz,2007-06-26T04:25Z,....just go here and get one of these E-SKY ...they work great and will give you almost as much control as you Futuba ...except on Helis.....or you can do a search on Ebay and get a cable to work with your RC .... I this link dos'nt work just do a search on Ebay for an E-SKY ...

,Seboz,2007-06-27T16:52Z,"The E-SKY works ""out of the box"" ....just need to configure it within G3 .... I was amazed just how well it worked....you can even trim each control ... only really has 4 main controls but thats all you need unless you want to fly helicopters ...but even they will fly as long as they only need 4 controls.....for around $20 plus postage its worth a go.....but I have had (G3) working with my Wingman but better than the wingman was the Sony controller with a PC adapter (from Ebay) but none are as goos as the E-SKY .... OK....a long way around to say....yea....""Out of the box"" .......!!!!!"

My controller will not be in until Monday and would like to tinker with it.
,Seboz,2007-08-02T23:07Z,@conexn .... ok .... I have had that same problem .... try making sure you are not connected to the net .... as it wants to update sometimes .... also keep trying it as it will work .... and yes you do need an esky controller or simular .... also you can try it on another system if you have one ... let me know how ya go .... good luck ...!

I searched the net and even posted this on knife edge forums! one of the forum moderators said it was a security thing and he suspected my copy wasn't legit!! help please this is driving me crazy, you have never seen someone so dedicated to getting this program!"
,fozjared,2007-08-23T04:23Z,"forget that last comment by me, i figured out that i was just being stupid.. but i do have a different question, can i run real flight without a controller, just off of the keyboard like i do in the real flight demo.. i ordered a cable for my futaba skysport 4vf but it wont be in for a few days and i would like to go ahead and get accustomed to the program before the cable comes in. let me know thanks!"

,Seboz,2007-08-30T03:30Z,Look ..... I have no idea what other cables work or not ..... all I do know is that like I have said b4 is that th ESKY from Ebay works great ..... so if you want to use this package then that is the best thing to do ..... buy one .... about $30 thats all ..... there are other cables that work but I hav'nt tried them .... I dont fly model planes just this sim ..... and the Esky works great .... some choppers dont work as they require more controls but all in all its great .... hipe this helps ......
,fozjared,2007-09-04T09:37Z,"finally got it working had to get some help from a computer tech friend of mine, turns out vista was moving the folder to a different partition when i launched it or something weird.. anyway it runs pretty great and looks nice, its just that everytime i crash any plane or helicopter it says an unexpected error has occured and the real flight shuts down and i have to get back to the emu and start it up, then i have to calibrate my controller all over again before i can start flying again! i have to recalibrate anytime real flight is closed.. i read in the read me to save the settings but i dont know how, i locked the calibration on the emu window but inside the game i dont know how to lock that calibration in.. it also always starts with the at-6 texan for some reason and i hardly ever fly it!

,heyra,2007-09-04T23:33Z,"fozjared did you get your own radio transmittor to work with this game or is it the esky you are talking about?

Thanks"
,Seboz,2007-09-05T12:21Z,@ fozjared .... yea .... strange one that.... it should save the joystick/esky config when you quit the game ...  also it should always go back to the last plane you had loaded .... mine does ... it does do some strange things though ... like sometimes wont start up and comes up with an error or 3 but I just quit it and start it again ....  I have installed this package on several pcs and always managed to get it working ... the esky thing can be a pain sometimes but you just have to keep doin the calibration again .... heres the no's I use ... they work for me but one guy says all he puts in was (1) in the first axis and thats all .....heres what I put in order and this is only for the Esky :(4) (2) (6) (8) (12) (48) (12) (50) (51) (52) ....hope this helps .... and btw ...i'm seeding again from 040907 .....!!!
,fozjared,2007-09-07T06:13Z,"i am using my own remote which is the new DX-7 from spectrum.. it works super! i had to recalibrate it everytime i fired it up for the first week but then something happened and it is saving my calibration for a change! so the radio works every time now! the only problem i am still having is that everytime i crash any plane an error message appears saying that an unexpected error has occured and it asks me if i want to send the error to knife edge.. i dont know why maybe a collision file is corrupt or something but whatever, it took me so long to get this game running, but now it is!! thanks so much for creating this SEBOZ!! you are awesome! btw how much time do you think you invested in creating this torrent?"
,Seboz,2007-09-07T06:33Z,@ fozjared .... seems that you have it all working good now a ..... well yea it can take a time to get it all workin and on differant pc's  but in the end it all comes together .... took a while just collecting all the addons and extras and then I coud'nt get it running ...only with a playstation converter at first .... but then I got the Esky and all was well ...when it was all workin well I thought I just had to share it ... !!
,craiger2007,2007-09-07T06:51Z,"Seboz.
Can you tell me if the expansion packs 1 and 2 have the serial number included as well in your collection?
And the Addon 1 thru 5 say G2 and not G3.
G2 is a different package.
I also use th eEsky..works very good.. its missing a couple switches I wish it had (like gear up and flaps)"
,Seboz,2007-09-07T15:08Z,@craiger2007 .... yes the serial numbers are included for all the addons ect .... may have to hunt around for them .... and the G2 addons all work on G3 and the 3.5 update ..... heres the Exp Pack 3   http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3788198/RealFlight_G3_Expansion_Pack_3

,Seboz,2007-09-07T17:17Z,@heyra .... well in can be a s.o.b to get going sometimes  ... all I can say is press 2 on the kb to bring up the controller in g3 and try and get the sticks in the centre ... also you must keep running the config calibration in realflight .... it does the same with me sometimes but I just keep at it and it works in the end .... but it seems that once you have it setup its ok .... lets know how ya go.....!!!
,heyra,2007-09-07T23:13Z,"seboz, the thing is that i dont understand this x1, x2 and so on. Am new to r/c flighing and i allready have the raptor 30 heli but i am missing some parts for it to make it complte. so i just want to learn how to fligh in simulation. Its really hard getting the esky to work."
,Seboz,2007-09-08T09:02Z,".....this is a pic of my Esky config for Realflight G3 .... it works fine for me .... but I must stress that it is very important to recalibrate each time you change a setting and you must bring up the rc (press kb 2) in G3 to make sure you have the sticks centered ...apart from that it should work but it can get tricky for some unknown reason ...just keep trying .... a lot of downloads on this so it will work .....!!!!

,fozjared,2007-09-10T19:24Z,"i bought a cable that interfaces my spektrum dx7 to my pc and all the helicopters work just fine, the only problem is that none of my radio switches work with the sim.. only the four channels of the sticks.. my gear nor my flaps nor my dual rate switches, anything.. and when i press ctrl+g for gear or ctrl+f for flaps the program halts and pops up and error message that says an unexpected error has occurred do you want to report to knife edge?  this is the same error message that i get when i crash any plane.. maybe i should re download one more time? but it does seem like the real radio works better in some respects than the interlink OR the esky!"
,craiger2007,2007-09-11T05:13Z,"I have the same problem to some extent. With my esky controller, on the first execution of the 2.07 emulator, the left side controls do not work and when I hit the flaps or gear the app closes instantly. No error message. I have since learnt to fix this, I start the emulator, check the ""override joystick controls"" launch the game, then exit the game right away, clear the override box then start the game again. Bit of a farce, but it works. "

,experimental_pilot,2007-09-30T01:30Z,"This didn't work for me.  I know what I'm doing when installing these things and I couldn't get it to recognize my Transmitter.  The problem is with the Dongle Emulator.

The program did run though and I wasn't impressed with the graphics anyway, so it's ok.

Aerofly Pro D,
Phoenix RC,
Reflex XTR,
and FS One are much better!

Although, I've only used Aerofly.

As far as the missing .dll file error, I got that as well on my first install. I read through the posts here and found the issue... You have to mount rfg_1 with daemon tools, or a similar program and install it that way. If you just double click the icon in your folder and install it like that, you will get the missing .dll error.

AFAIK there are no photofields in this release."

Dude, no offense intended, frustration abounds.  My trouble is, no matter how many times I try to launch the program, I get that message and loading is halted.  I can't even get to the point of using the torrent you recommended (I found that torrent last night and dl'd it to try to use it.)  I even opened the emulator and set it up like the screenshot, but still nothing.  One problem I think is I'm using Vista Home ed and can't rename my controller.  Not sure what else to try, other than re-un-installing and reinstalling again.... aarrrrghhh.  

again bro, no offense intended, just trying to get this figured out.  I can see by the number of d/l's that plenty of folks have had luck with it, I just wish I were among that group, and I'm fairly savvy with using daemon/ISO type files and such....   I've got to be missing something....  "
