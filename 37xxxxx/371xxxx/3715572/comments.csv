,Hartorr,2007-06-18T20:05Z,"@benny hill:  Yes I know how the the DVD set contains 4 DVDs, but on the actual DVDs, the first DVD is labeled ""disc 2"" and the last ""disc 5"" even though there are only 4 discs.  Hence the confusion if ""DVD 3"" means ""3 of the 4 in the set"" or ""disc 3 as labeled"" (meaning it would be ""disc 2 of the set)... Confused yet? ;)"
