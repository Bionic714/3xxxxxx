Loved it!
Great acting! Great dialogue! Great chemistry!
But what a horrible soundtrack! :) he he. That's about the only thing i didn't like about this movie. But, since it's from 1997 i can easily overlook that. It didn't ruin the story.

Surprising to see Scarlett Johansson in an early extras part. Wonder how much she was paid back then? :)

Thanks again for this movie-gift, it made my day!
