[1] Nonhuman creatures = sexless

This particular torrent is most likely reencoded and branded ""IJR"" from an AVI file (~700 M).

2'th that 1,
however as a matter of Fact, its fully possible to edit out that without _ANY_ quality-loss (yes, lossless movie compression does exist), but that would do a Much larger movie than the original. "
