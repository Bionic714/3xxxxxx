,rmcluesman,2009-06-08T01:20Z,is this the color version?
,nadrew,2011-08-16T02:28Z,@rmcluesman this is the b/w version. Color version seems to be here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5712821/Forbidden_Zone_(beginning_of_Oingo_Boingo_with_the_Mystic_Knight
,brutal_product,2012-04-15T07:01Z,original is B/W. altho the color version looks to be remastered with 5.1 dolby audio. best elfman score ever.
