Win32:Delf-IBJ [Trj]
Trojan Horse
080216-0, 16-02-2008

My copy of Lightshop came from another torrent, but if that has been repacked to this - then it's maybe still there.
Could be a false hit - but I don't take any chances. Please don't start on the ""U suxxes, n00b, teh cracked programs/keygens often give false hit. roflmao kopt3r neeb neeb something something"" - I'm fulle aware of such - but a trojan in a plugin (.8bf)? First one I've ever encountered...

ListBlack, do you have those WITHOUT the crap?"
,mybell12,2008-11-25T22:06Z,tnx for the warnings.
,west54,2010-08-11T09:30Z,Well Fuck this torrent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,PrvWrz,2010-10-13T08:45Z,"I'm sorry, but you guys should get a real AV, or uninstall that sh!t AV. AVG? Well, Avast, Avira, AVG.. All are in same way. Same sh!t. KeyGen with trojan? Since when the crack teams infect their own work? No dudes. That is a incorrect AV engine. Can you read it? If yes, read this: 
>>> Some antivirus and antispyware programs flag KeyGens/Patch as being infected/malware, although the applications are perfectly safe and does not pose a threat to your system. This is called a 'false positive'. The term false positive is used when antivirus software wrongly classifies an inoffensive (packed) file as a virus. The incorrect detection may be due to heuristics or to an incorrect virus signature in a database. Similar problems can occur with antitrojan or antispyware software. "
,PrvWrz,2010-10-13T08:47Z,"- Continued Texts..
If you (The reader) don't trust crackers works, please, go buy original, and stop crying.
Or make your own one in C++/C#. :-)"
,owenisred,2011-07-22T18:38Z,This is actually one of the better torrents. Agree with PrvWrz completely.
