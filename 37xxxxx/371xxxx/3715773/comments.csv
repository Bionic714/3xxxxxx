,coolndeep,2009-02-01T03:43Z,How could the run time (according to description) be only 95 mins? where as the imdb profile (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0223897/) says its 123 mins long. Is there 28 mins missing from this release? Please share...

,bakedbaker,2010-11-27T10:48Z,Best movie i've ever seen. thx so much man great fucking job
,gurpreet212004,2010-12-02T02:29Z,"Somebody please comment whether movie is complete or not...????????
        why 95 min instead of 123 minutes. 
also comment on quality. 75 seeders and nobody has commented...!!!!!!!! huh"
,vivatpb5776,2010-12-09T11:26Z,"gurpreet212004, I agree with you. People should stop complaining and at least comment on the quality. However, you are just as much at fault. It took me 35 minutes to download this movie. You posted your comment a week ago. If you downloaded the movie, you could have been the first to comment on the quality.

First off, the info in the torrent is wrong. It shows a running time of 95 minutes (1 hour 35 minutes); however, the file is actually 118 minutes (1 hour 58 minutes). Missing five minutes could be credits (opening credits seem truncated) or closing credits. The audio/video is on point with the majority of DVDRips out there.

Overall:
Audio: 9/10
Video: 9/10

Thank you uploader."

the point is, I have not downloaded this movie till now, and was waiting for somebody to comment on movie length. and mind it, everybody is not having same great download speeds as of yours. it took hours for me to download a movie. I always comment where there's a need. uploader CPtscene should have corrected it.
          Anyways thanx for ur comment. "
,bravos2u,2011-07-31T19:44Z,"ThankYou, ThankYou 4 including the subtitles !!!

Thanks Again CPtScene !!!"
,TacoMagoo819,2011-08-03T07:53Z,Thanks so much for the movie. I'm satisfied with the A/V. 
,TheHumanBot,2011-11-16T00:38Z,"This is legit, and for those asking about the duration: The video ends with the movie, i mean, it doesn't have credits.
Thanks for the spanish subtitles.
A/10
V/10"
