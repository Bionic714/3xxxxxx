So if you can't understand Italian or Spanish, too bad."

Anyone know if this version is edited or is the original complete 105 minute movie.

And yes I realize the description says 100 min , just wondering."

,neukdiegeiten,2008-06-04T20:00Z,"egroj: it should be the original, only played at 25fps (because it's a PAL DVD). The original film is shot at 24fps. 105/(25/24) = 100. "
