Space Jam came out in 1996. One of my very favorite movies. I like the way they mixed cartoon characters like Bugs Bunny with Michael Jordan. Movie is less than 700MB can easily fit in 1 CD. Quality is Xvid with optional English sub-titles. I am sure you will enjoy this movie and include it in your collection.
