Yes there are others fancying stuff like this :)"
,Gouldblum,2007-06-17T22:32Z,"NICE, thank you very much for this, been looking everywhere for it as well :D"
,The_Cube,2007-06-18T21:39Z,"Hey, if any of you guys can figure out how to get the multiplayer working online, let me know.  My friend and I got as far as ""I can see his game but can't join.""  I think we need to open ports but don't know which ones."
,Tyfon,2007-06-18T23:50Z,"The Cube uÂ´r my god :)

Been looking for it for years now. Ever since I remembered my old Deadloch game and looked around for a sequal."
,Gouldblum,2007-06-19T02:25Z,"Cube have you tried with Hamachi? what it does is basicially make a LAN over the internet, try to google it if you haven't teted, and let us know if you can get it to work :)"
,The_Cube,2007-06-19T09:52Z,"Actually, Hamachi was the only thing that got us that close.  Direct IP connection didn't do anything, but trying to connect to his Hamachi IP at least showed his game, but I couldn't join.  Tried Hamachi with the original Deadlock too, and it doesn't do anything at ALL, so I'm holding more hope for Deadlock 2."
,Lechka,2007-06-19T22:37Z,"Try using an older hamachi version, 1.0.2.2 seems to have some problems sometimes (for me atleast) Try 1.0.1.5"
,finchinator101,2007-07-15T02:36Z,Seed plz!! I need this game!! lol haven't played in so long.
,Desdinova04,2007-09-01T04:36Z,"It says I need to have the disc in the drive to play. That's why I downloaded it, I don't know where mine is. Any ways around this problem?"
,rascorrupt,2007-12-29T04:06Z,"If you have problems installing, just copy the folder INSTALL from the disc to where you want the game.
If it complains about not having the disc in, mount the disc with the latest version of Daemon Tools."
,SadBear,2008-03-30T20:56Z,Thx for the upload. Just remembered playing this game and got all nostalgic :)
,styret1,2008-07-17T22:34Z,Dont have any speech on the charracter al other sound works fine...anyone that can help with that?
,georgeous2,2008-09-02T23:56Z,"How on earth do you get this game to work???
There isn't an ISO file anywhere so you can't mount the image... It just asks for the CD.
How can i get around this?
It installed fine though, just can't play it!?!"

,kc1979,2009-07-20T00:35Z,"Thanks a lot for wasting two cds jerk!  I downloaded this piece of shit and I burned a disc.  It said, please insert original disc.  Then I downloaded daemon tools.  I burned another CD and it didn't work.  Thanks a shitload!!!!  Nothing more aggravating than someone who loads an unusable piece of shit program on here."
,Steelers39,2009-08-13T22:08Z,"@kc1979

Just because you don't know what your doing doesn't mean it doesn't work"
,Nautishko,2009-10-11T09:25Z,"I used to play the original back when the graphics were not laughable, haha.

Thank you for the upload."
,1nTh3fAc3,2010-08-21T15:38Z,"dude, thank you! i  had this game, but lost it in the move. been looking for this for a long time. so thank you again."
,contralegem,2010-10-02T22:40Z,"SEEEEEED please!!! I ve been looking for this game for so long and now having found it, the download speed is 0.5kb!!! Come on pirates!!!"
,contralegem,2010-10-02T23:06Z,sseeeeeeeeeeeed please!!!
,contralegem,2010-10-03T12:55Z,"HORROR! I ve downloaded, quickmounted, and when tried to install it, it give me this error: ""%srequires Microsoft DirectX drivers to be installed on your PC. However"" - and then i can't see the rest of the message!
GUYS, please help! I ve got windows 7 64, but this game used to work before on my friend's laptop. (He deleted it before i managed to copy it from him)
What can I do???"
,Toxpack,2011-06-01T22:48Z,NICE ! thx so much ! been playing the first game all my childhood :) so amazing ! bless ya ! 
,aaronvman,2012-02-28T01:32Z,Ok so its easy guys mount the iso and then copy the disc to a folder..... go to the 'install' folder and run the application.. easy peasy... now anyone have the patch they made that made the AI better?
,Virsteinn,2012-05-26T23:45Z,"When trying to get the first Deadlock game installed, I came across a virtual machine with a Windows 98 OS included. It allowed me to hear EVERYTHING; speech, music, ambiance, the works. I'll post another comment if Deadlock 2 works the same way."
,Virsteinn,2012-05-26T23:46Z,"Oh, and for those of you who know how tinies work (the shorter links), type ThisVirtualMachine at the end."
,Virsteinn,2012-05-26T23:49Z,"Also, I should mention, I'm running Windows 7 right now, so normally I wouldn't be able to run Deadlock. It's because of that virtual machine that I was able to play it with sound and all."
,Virsteinn,2012-05-27T00:38Z,"You know what, install the game on the virtual machine, share a folder on the physical machine (your computer) that isn't read-only, and copy and paste the game into that folder. I just did so, I got all the sound and music, even speech."
