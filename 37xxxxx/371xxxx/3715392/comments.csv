First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.


Install those and report back!

KMPlayer to play HD from HDTV CHINA

If you download those 3 and install them all downloads from HDTV CHINA will work Have downloaded 40 and all works"
