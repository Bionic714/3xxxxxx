modified grafix settings file for dirt, if u are having framerate problems playing the races against other cars
backup the system folder from dirt and unrar this to your dirt folder...it gave me an fps boost, from 10-15fps. to 45-75fps. with my ati radeon 1950 pro :)
and if u still are having problems try setting everything to low or off in dirt options 

have fun
