,muufasaurus,2009-06-29T18:01Z,@vahnx: The kid from the 1993 accusations confessed that he LIED about everything; his father was trying to get millons on dollars out of it.
,Specter,2009-06-30T05:01Z,"You people that are saying he's a child molester, you do know what 'aquitted of all charges' mean?
Too bad Martin Bashir had to twist the whole documentary into a media circus of lies and backstabbing, it really is a bullshit documentary.
Facts, i love them."

,Dragonite_9,2011-05-31T19:17Z,"Please read this before post comments saying he is a child molester!
(Except if you are one of those idiot ignorant persons who can not or will not see this for what it really is, and just made up your mind, from things you have heard from the MEDIA, in the NEWS (like they ALWAYS re so correct, or always tell the truth, or always never put an angle on the news in anyway they want it too be.... just saying people..)  
and never going to change your ignorant mind, for some reason that the world will never understand, mainly I believe it's because either you do not have one, or secretly are so damn jealous of him, his amazing voice and songs, etc, so that you can not stand he have (had) it and you don't, so you must trash talk his reputation as much as you can, because if you can't have it, he sure as hell should not be admired and worshiped and loved for it bye the rest of the world. So bye that standard you just write these comments that he is a child molester, just to fill your anger and jealousy with some form of ""thingy"" that makes it a bit easier for you to accept that you are a nobody  (in the meaning that you are not famous, loved by the whole world, or can sing as a god or creature from another world) and he was the King of Pop, and so so so so so much more talented, respectable, humble, and so kind and forgiving, even against people like you, he would forgive your ignorant comments, and that people is real incredible powers to have if you could do that to all those (well with some exceptions of the really really mean big fucking douschbags!) who so greatly offended you and hurt you. That is pure and incredible love and powers unimaginable for a human being to possess, even after what half the world done to him!
The is really really admirable and respectable that he is able to do, despite what all you idiots done to him..)

PLEASE START READ HERE IF YOU ARE NOT ONE OF THOSE:   

(Please feel free and I encourages you all to copy this comment and post it in all torrents of MJ you could find, or where ever you feel like there is a need to spread the word and once and for all put a stop to all these horrible, but again and again, posted ignorant posts saying he is a fucking child molester, etc. Enlighten these people by give them the possibility ti read this and try to change their narrow minded ways of seeing things, and probably the whole world and all in it for that mater! Please do so, thank you!)    

A lot people do say that he is innocent just because they adore and worship him yes FRivera.

However, a lot people are not idiots and can see both the facts and the outcome of the trials.

Yes he have done some pretty inappropriate things and statements, but that hardly makes him a child molester! ( It is more like, as we do for a fact know!, that he did not have a childhood, his devil to father made him work his ass off his hole youth, hence no childhood experinced, which absolutely would affect a lot of people in a bad way, so that it's hardly not understandable where this comes from, that he is as he was, lived in the childhood he never had, now when he was older. There bye some things he did that was not so appropriate, for a man his ""bodily"" age, but okej for his ""mental age"", which was so much still there in the childhood he never had, and tried to relive in a proper way, when he was older, both consciously and subconsciously. Resulting in some, for a man his age, inappropriate behavior, by our worlds standards. Although for him it never was anything more then just as kids his ""mentally age"" would be doing!
So he never saw it the way the rest of the world saw it, and when the accusations where made, these inappropriate things he where doing, although not at all any sexual, where the confirmation for big parts of the world that there must be more going on in there then just ""kids playing and having fun"", even though this never was the case, which EVEN the court decided and dropped all charges!
If you want to hear a song where he talks about (lyrics) the childhood he never had, listen to ""Have y"
