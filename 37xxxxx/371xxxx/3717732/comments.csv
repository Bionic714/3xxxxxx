I'd like to ask if you could head over to the mininova forum and then to the > Torrents chat > Games > Problems & Questions Section.

Theres a thread about your Two Worlds release.
People would like to know whether they should wait or not.
Just to straighten things out :)"

It's simple to find a keygen for the game, just google.

Anyway , thanks ... and if somebody ever needs the serials, just write me to the em@il above. "

 Greetings fellow pirates.

 There is indeed a new enemy amongst torrents and they are trying to control
 all good gaming torrents everywhere. Leeching and dumping data, not sharing
 a bit of data, which is making it near impossible to download many torrents.

 I have included a dopeman_blocklist.txt file. YOU MUST load this file to
 Peerguardian as an addtional blocklist -or- load the file to whatever means
 of IP blocking you have available to your BT Client.

 If you do not, you will simply be sharing data to these cowards and not other
 legit torrent users trying to download. 

 Please try to understand the importance of this. It must be used to begin
 saving game torrents everywhere. This is a new enemy. We must do our best 
 to fight back to preserve our freedom of sharing. 

 Please use the blocklist and share it anyway you can.

 dopeman"
,PoTski,2007-07-27T22:07Z,"TY man, for the release. Could you send me 4 reg files with different keys too? Awsome game play!"

,Ola435345345,2007-07-30T21:19Z,"Scurco you said ""this game isnt any fun if you cant play online"".. Maybe you have missed that among the playable scenarios theres a bunch of them called ""operation"".. Those are the ones you can play alone. ""Street justice"" and ""Shattered harbour"" for example. I have had problems connecting the game  via LAN but I have played It that way and Its just amazing.. Dont miss the new escalation pack. Give It a try! "
