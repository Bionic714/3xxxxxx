,JoeGoFishFSX,2008-05-03T00:55Z,"WOW! Thanks Man, Truly appreicate this for FSX. Fully working, EVERYTHING! Is working from panels to commands etc. So Fun to fly! 

And a NOTE to Boogie73, You have to look at the torrents files and should be two folders, FS9 and FSX, First go into FS9 and actually isntall the Legacy in there, once thats installed, go to the FSX Folder and install the patches, You cant just install patches and expect things to work, But There ya go Boogie, That should work fine

But Rilaohan Thanks Again! "

,the_wingman,2011-05-28T01:56Z,"It's a beautiful aircraft.
Only the FMS is not working. It keeps showing a black screen.
I tried every switch/knob to try it on. I tried it also to find it in the setup, but nothing.
Could someone help me?"
