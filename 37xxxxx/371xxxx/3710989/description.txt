This is a archive containing alot of acapella-vocals from the old motown records.

I found this on another site, and thought it should be published so the rest of the world can hear these old goodies. The vocals were extracted from a karokee cd. But it\\\'s the original productions and vocals. I will post the instrumentals as well as soon as I get the renamed.

Hope you all will enjoy.
