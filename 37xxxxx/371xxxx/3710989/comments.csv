,Andrewbsupafly,2007-06-19T09:56Z,This is the first comment Ive ever posted. This is one of the best torrents I've found along with the instrumentals. Great pack & uncommon. Cheers.
,miffospliffo,2007-06-22T00:31Z,"Andrew> Thanx, it's my first torrent. I just thought of making life a little bit easier for all those bedroom producers out there. I will defiently upload more acapellas torrents soon.  "
,Fox-1,2007-07-11T13:46Z,"Finally someone who uploads quality acapella's.  Got several collections from trackers all over the place and those are usually filled with all kind of LoFi and homemade crap.

These are good.  It's only 192kbps but the tracks are so old that it doesn't matter too much."
