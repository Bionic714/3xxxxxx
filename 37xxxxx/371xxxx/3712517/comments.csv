You just want to advertise Avast. Don't listen to this guy."
,Phaedrus_x,2007-06-25T02:02Z,"Trust me, I have no interest in promoting any anti-virus checker. But I've downloaded two different go games, and they both were flagged as containing a trojan virus. I'm not sure what to say; I'm just reporting what my AV program identified. If it's wrong, so be it. But I'm not willing to take a chance just because some anonymous person on the Internet tells me it's safe."
