,newbs4ever,2007-06-18T22:11Z,Hello It appears that your install file doesn't work but non the less u game does....just install from main download then unpack the 5 winrar files and then use the setup tool if needed but then u can use game.exe and it works.....I think u should change the instruction dude...but thx man i am enjoying it...awesome work...pitty the vids dont work in game.
,zaku89,2007-06-18T22:48Z,"hmm... installing this thing seems to be giving me some trouble.

The install.exe is inaccessible for some reason.

Could someone help?"
,newbs4ever,2007-06-18T23:24Z,ok use the install.exe file the first one which lets u install to ur desired location...then ignore subzero instructions. Once it is installed goto the dir were u installed it and unpack the file to that folder...once u have done all the unpacking u will see all the files in the current folder..( pls note the game now works when using game.exe) but not all the files will be associated with the game. (this is were u need to use setup.bat....but u will get broken videos i don't know how to make the videos work...but once u run  setup.bat (i got a dos box with loads of access is denied stuff) launch the game via game.exe and play...if u have a gamepad i recommend it otherwise the mose patch via piratebay works to but makes it to easy...any questions keep em coming
,newbs4ever,2007-06-18T23:24Z,i meant to say unpack the files

Have any idea what's wrong?

,Born Again,2007-06-24T11:19Z,NICE ONE!!!!!!  Easy to install Unrar those 5 files and play. don't forget to register it
[V],Subzero!,2007-06-24T18:58Z,"iceman dude step by step...

1st

left double click on ResEvil 4.part01.rar (window opens)

then you drag and drop the folder to any place you wish...

go to this folder... ResEvil4 

once you are there, double click on

Start_Game-Install.bat

the intro appears (exit with ESC key)

game starts installing , be patience takes awhile...

once its finished you can click on game.exe and play the game... with all textatures and musix, but without vids!.... 

all these steps ive done in the background (except installing to the end, did that already a few times i know it works!) therefor all you have to do unrar , go to folder ResEvil4 and double click on the > Start_Game-Install.bat < and wait... intro exit esc key and wait... game starts with game.exe....

dont listen to that instructions coming upon people who didnt followed the instructions!!!... my little sister is able to install this...

happy gaming....

outta here!

Special Info Note:

Some virus-scanner recognize the header of packed exe's (ToeD.exe)

as a lame virus, (coz it's the mostly byte by byte check error of 'em!.)

This is truly a false information!,  a so called false positive, you can read 

more about in your VirusTool-Manual or WebSite!.
