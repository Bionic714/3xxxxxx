Thanks"

...Sukiyaki was sung by Mr. Kyu Sakamoto.
Words by Mr. Rokusuke Ei, music by Mr. Hachidai Nakamura.

Thanks, reichert!
Don't like the later english versions though from ""4.P.M"" and ""a taste of  honey"". They tweak the beautiful original melody not to my likings.
I think the ""Sakamoto Kyu - Sukiyaki (English).mp3"" file is the version sung by ""a taste of honey"""

,Bambikilr,2012-05-17T13:14Z,"THANKS! Just remembered this sweet lil' classic when I was putting together music for a big Luau/Reggae/Surf-inspired BBQ-party. Sakamoto-San will be in good company of Elvis, The Ventures, The Beach Boys and a big bunch of Reggae and Dancehall :)

This is not a fake... Proper, crystal clear mp3 files. "
,Bambikilr,2012-05-17T13:32Z,"..oh... and btw, I'm far from being able to remember the rage of this tune... I'm turning 30 for the party, so indeed, this is an immortal classic :) I just reckon' good music is hard to come by nowadays :)

Hate the english title, but I guess it'd never gotten so famous with the original name. (I speak a bit of Japanese and find the original title beautiful and the English one rather insulting... Whether it's the most insulting towards the Japanese or the Yankees, however, I don't really know... lol)

I can't understand why a skulled member will put down the UL? (@Mbb15) 

As I said just now in the comment above; no viruses detected, a text document with the lyrics in Japanese and English, 
3 proper mp3's of three versions of the song (two of them by Sakamoto-San, and the last one of them by 4PM (not as wrongly stated - A taste of Honey, which was a discoballad by a girlgroup in the early 80's) a yucky wailing boybandsoul cover, and last, 
a proper functioning mpg with a Japanese recording from a top list show on tv, with a much older than he actually was, Sakamoto, performing the tune on stage in 1981.

I will seed this as long as I can :) I wish more people would UL stuff like this :) Rare and unforgettable oldies and little pearls :)"
