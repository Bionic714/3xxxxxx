Eclectic dark sinths, virtuosistic pianos, melodic vocal and bombastic guitars. I highly recomment it to any electronica & alternative rock fan. You wont be disappointed.

Creatica has won several important awards and toured all over the world. First class electronica from Europe. Their genre is Rock mixed wisely with Electronica. \\\\\\\"Sheer beauty like I never heard Before\\\\\\\" Thomas Mac Dowell (Rolling Stone Magazine), \\\\\\\"These sounds are driving me crazy for the first time in my life. Creatica owns a very original sound... and its cool \\\\\\\" Peter Ryan (Hard Rock Magazine)

Lots of groove & really nice sounds here. Such a sweet finding!. A great album from a little known artist and a gem in is own.

High quality bitrate in all songs. Enjoy.
