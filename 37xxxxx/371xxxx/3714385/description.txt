Ok, here\'s the Miroslav sound updater 1.1b
Tested w. Sound-DVD2 that\'s available here @ TPB, and it works great :D

With this you can update the 1.0 sounds from Sound-DVD2 to work with your 
1.1 miroslav system. 

Run this AFTER you\'ve installed the whole program, authorized it, 
installed & updated sound-DVD1 (with the 1.1A soundupdater) 
and installed Sound-DVD2.. so, in other words this is the last thing you do.. 


Hope u guys didn\'t spend as much time banging your heads against the wall as I did.. t
