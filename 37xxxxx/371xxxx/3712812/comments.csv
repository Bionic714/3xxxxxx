If you like em, at least buy an album or two before you steal em all."
,Posthumous,2008-02-13T20:58Z,Lebarf:  I think Lemmy would approve of downloading!
,LithGeezy,2008-04-18T22:42Z,"yeah. most bands would absolutely love it if people just downloaded everything they produced, rather than buy anything... makes sense... that must be how big bands get rich, posting everything on the internet..."
,mrkleen,2008-04-21T03:12Z,"Awsome, thanks!"
,bremingt,2008-06-01T23:30Z,I won't listen to metal if the band isn't either very rich or hasn't won a grammy.  Lemmy does really good work with his millions of dollars.  It's money well spent.  I certainly can't speak for the band but I imagine they prefer to play for thousands of douche bags at a time.  It gives them a chance to make new friends.
,sean_360,2008-06-08T21:56Z,"Thank you for this up ^ ^
Good album and good quality."

,Peregr1n,2008-08-31T16:26Z,"Lebarf: I'm downloading this album because I want to listen to it and decide whether it's worth buying. If I like it, I'll head to eyechoons. Motorhead will gain another fan, another sale, and be able to buy another yacht. Happy?"
,ownedproperty,2008-10-15T21:18Z,"Awesome upload man, fuckin awesome band, and as long as they earnin 100k a month or more, i really dont think they care. And if they do, tough shit!!"

to quote dave grohl from nirvana/foofighters...


""Fuck Keith Richards, fuck all those dudes who survived the sixties. Flying around in private jets, living up their gunslinger reputation as they fuck supermodels in the most expensive hotel in Paris. It's like: you know what Lemmy is doing? Lemmy is... probably drinking Jack'N'Cokes and writing another record!"""
