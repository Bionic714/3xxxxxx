,daclozerman,2007-08-09T05:44Z,"This thing works great!  Except, I have encountered two problems, but I don't think it has anything to do with MusicPiratex.  When I click the TV icon, nothing pops up.  Do I need like an atenna hooked up to it? etc.  And when I click the radio it says I don't have a radio tuner card, but when I click FM radio, it works fine! It's a lot better than Windows Media Center!"

My problem is that I cant install the Powercinema from the CD i got when I bought the card, so I'll try to downlaod it instead :("
