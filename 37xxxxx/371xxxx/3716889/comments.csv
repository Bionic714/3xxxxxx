,larrychodiechode,2008-04-18T22:38Z,I got the VLC player and the file works perfectly fine. I was just curious as to what I need to do to be able to burn the files to DVD using ConvertXtoDVD. Thanks in advance.
,Zykure,2008-06-23T18:08Z,"ConvertXtoDVD can be used to convert arbitrary movie files (AVI, MPG, ...) to DVD format.
Since you already got VOB-files (which are DVD format), you only need to put these files on a DVD. If you're using some good enough software (Nero, k3b etc.) it should provide a function for burning VOBs to DVD."
