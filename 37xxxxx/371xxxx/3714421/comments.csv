When finished PLEASE SEED."
,BalleKnalle,2007-06-16T01:40Z,Works this online?
[T],ripthejacker420,2007-06-16T21:45Z,only the single player works but it also crashes every time i try to load or  quickload during a game.
,rebellejen,2007-06-17T19:05Z,"try turning your graphics down -- game might be spazzing out because your system can't handle it. That fixed my problems with that. Also helps to shut off all background programmes, but I'm sure you knew that. "
,thefencemarv,2007-07-06T21:27Z,"Thanks for the detailed explanation on installing cracking and running the game. I am just learning how to do this stuff. I love the ""on your own"" comment. My friend tells me to google it when I ask him for help. "
,Bo Rock,2007-07-12T18:45Z,great job...thanks...
,Captain_Juno,2007-08-12T02:36Z,Why am I getting a blank screen when I try to play multiplayer?  I tried the hosts.sam thing but I only have a lmhosts.sam file and put the extra ip and information in there.
,bbeessii,2007-10-02T22:46Z,"I've donloaded the game and i have installed but i have a problem. When i play  the game the sound comes a little bit later i  mean when i fire with a gun the sound of the gun comes a little bit later.
Can somebody tell me how can i fix this bug."
,kcsx,2007-10-28T06:51Z,"Hey bbeessii, update your audio drivers n00b"
,Stevo24,2007-10-31T01:48Z,Hey can someone give me a valid CD Key so that I can play online? Thanks ^_^.
,Florentin91,2007-11-05T20:59Z,"great upload , thanx ^^"
,Masturbo,2007-12-19T15:54Z,There was no crack & keygen folder. Pity.
,Foma123,2008-01-03T16:11Z,Cant run sekond last one and the last one pacth so the multiplayer doesnt work
,HavokMalo113,2008-02-23T22:58Z,No keygen or crack included. So this is partial win - partial blow.
,ENERGIE_FIN,2008-03-14T23:34Z,"i can't install it!!!
please help!!!! it says the file is corrupt"
,redjokerblue,2008-03-26T03:33Z,"good seed! 
game works fine wihtout any errors. 
(install/play)
@ENERGIE_FIN: Who said it was corrupt? Poweriso?"
,eric2142,2008-04-02T22:54Z,"Thank you so much! Great game and it works perfect for me. Had no problems at all. I enjoyed the extras you added to the package and the updates that were included were very convenient. The Key Generator gave me a valid and completely working CD Key for the install. However... At first, I noticed I was not able to play in online (multiplayer) mode because it gave me an ""Invalid Key"" error when I tried to connect to servers. But, as a tip for any people here ready to download this... You can get your CD Key to become authentic and play online! Heres a simple easy step I ended up figuring out. In your main folder after you've downloaded the game, open CRACK & KEYGEN and then update + crack. Then open your RETURN.TO.CASTLE.WOLFENSTEIN folder and open the ""rtcw"" file, it's a Registry (.reg) file. If you get a Registry Editor alert asking you if you would like to continue, click yes to allow the entry to be added to your registry. That's it! You're all done, go enjoy a good online battle!
Oh and, this game is virus and threat free, nice and clean.



I would recommend using PowerISO to open your game folder like the publisher recommends. It's a really convenient program. It has cool features to easily allow you to extract the files to somewhere and to burn a copy of the game to a CD or DVD. You can even create a virtual drive and send the game to it like you have your game disc inserted and ready to install. You can download it at www.poweriso.com for FREE. With the free version, you get a 300 MB limitation though. Use this information to unlock the FULL version like I did. Username: Michael | Serial: H258V-QW4LN-RBFK2-X569E-PCJ8E



ENJOY!!!! =D

,warfeel,2008-04-27T13:25Z,"Yes the multiplayer works, but make sure you DONT patch up to 1.4b because you can only play on like 2 servers there. 

Only patch up to 1.1 then you can play on like half of the servers there. If you want hitsounds or configs, scripts and more visit www.etconfig.com "
,georgegeorgegeorge,2008-05-16T22:06Z,I don't know what these guys are smoking. Online does NOT work. Perhaps it does for v1.0 but not after it's updated.
,Arandie,2008-07-10T20:10Z,Thanks for the poweriso information eric2142!
,snake_is_solid,2008-07-13T06:29Z,Thanks singeplayer works perfect. I don't know about you but i got multiplayer to work. I just followed eric2142's instructions and it worked. I only updated to 1.1 so i don't know about the other updates. Got tons of servers but only managed to play for like 15 minutes since my internet connection ain't that good. Oh well good luck to other downloaders.
