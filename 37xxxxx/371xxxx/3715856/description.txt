The Rebel Intruders (1980)

Avg. Rating:  	
  4.2 / 5 (based on 11 ratings).

Plot:	Set in the early Republican years, some skilled refugees run afoul of a powerful traitor, and from then on it?s one amazing battle after another.

Overview:	China is ripped apart by a civil war, and thousands of displaced refugees swarm into towns not yet ravaged by war. Three such refugees (Phillip Kwok, Lo Meng, and Chiang Sheng) arrive in one town, only to get caught up in a web of intrigue, deception, and death. This is a truly brilliant film, with stunning acrobatic martial artistry, and an excellent story. Phillip Kwok is top notch as a top fighter forced to bend his own moral code, due to the circumstances he finds himself in. Awesome stuff.
