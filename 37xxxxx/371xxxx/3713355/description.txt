..:: Synopsis ::..

Near the end of World War II, Hitler gave his personal diary to an aid for safekeeping. Containing minutes from a secret meeting between emissaries of Hitler and Roosevelt, it outlined plans to join forces against the Soviet Union. Ironically, the American representative was a relative of Jake Cazalet, the current U.S. president. Now this diary has become a powerful weapon. It's up to Sean Dillon to secure the diary, but danger is closing in from all sides.

"Filled with hairpin twists and high-tension action, with characters as dark and surprising as any he has created, this is Higgins working at the peak of his power." -amazon.com
