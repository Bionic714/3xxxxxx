,hurrafor,2007-07-19T16:29Z,"ABSOLUTELY works....you just have to do a little digging:

First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

http://haali.cs.msu.ru/mkv/

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.


Install those and report back!

KMPlayer to play HD from HDTV CHINA

If you download those 3 and install them all downloads from HDTV CHINA will work Have downloaded 40 and all works"

is what im downloading but from what i understand this is the same thing, anyway this is my 3rd hd movie after 1st and 3rd part of the trilogy, and files dont seem to work

i can play 1st and 3rd part perfectly fine with 24 fps it gives me, but 2nd part Reloaded will not render file, ive played with many codecs and players, and right now using VistaCodecs_v450, on my 32bit vista buisness

is there anyone having problems just playing this movie? "
,Bugdoctor,2007-10-08T00:55Z,"I downloaded this release and all discs work 100% perfectly. 

I recommend using zoom player with haali media splitter installed. Windows media player 11 also plays this smoothly. KM player and VLC will not play the files properly.

The only problem I have is the occasional stutter in fast moving sequences, but this is down to my crappy graphics card that doesn't like VC-1 codec :("
,ThaBrad,2008-03-04T17:11Z,"Hey. Don't know how to play the movie!!!

Didn't worked with VLC, and MediaPLayerClassis only sound!

do I need the .part-Files for anything?


PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!!"
