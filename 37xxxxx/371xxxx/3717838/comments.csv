I loved Majesty, didn't know there was an expansion.."
[V],Subzero!,2007-06-20T00:19Z,"to Sture_Ture ... you enjoy !!!



and to mach789 (machtabbanix)

you might be a bit stupid i dont wanna explain this matter over and over again, fuck you all who think its a trojan, get a fukkin life!... and most important get a REAL VIRUS TOOL... 
why not rar the file and report it to your virustools website, they will tell you aswell as i do that this aint be a trojan!

there you go you moron! "
,Gouldblum,2007-06-20T14:10Z,"anyone who got this working on XP? I can start the original Majesty up, but as soon as its done loading a mission, Windows gives me a critical error and quits the game.... and can't even start the expansion......

Love this game btw, would really like some tips how to get it working"
[V],Subzero!,2007-06-20T18:48Z,"didnt had that prob overhere....
"
,Gouldblum,2007-06-20T20:38Z,Hmm ok :/
,Gouldblum,2007-06-20T22:06Z,"Must be a error with my specs or setup, just gotten hold of the full version of majesty gold, and it does the same thing, so this release should work fine for most ppl"
,Gouldblum,2007-06-20T22:52Z,"If anyone else have trouble, try disabling DirectDraw in your directX tool, it works for me :)

It will fuck up cutscenes, but since they are ripped from this release it doesn't matter much"
[V],Subzero!,2007-06-21T00:19Z,"finally you got it, happy gaming!"
,ralekk,2007-06-22T13:23Z,"Best game ever!

,Spartan25,2007-07-06T09:10Z,Can anyone tell me why I should run the exe when it pops up as a Trojan? Most other torrents get by fine with an .iso and a CD crack.
[V],Subzero!,2007-07-24T11:11Z,"this is a false positive, if you dont start this exe file , the game probably doesnt runs in later levels.... its a packed exe file your virus tool doesnt know about, thats why it claimed to found a trojan... but untrue, believe it or not I WOULD NEVER spread nor UPLOAD viruses, because i check my uploads before i upload all the time!....."
,Rexann89,2007-09-16T23:15Z,Why is the music gone? The game works great but there is no background music.
,druidravi,2007-10-06T20:20Z,"Please people keep sharing it , I want to download fast"
,druidravi,2007-10-07T20:25Z,Guys please continue seeding it ...I have to use a tunneling software to download torrents which makes it very slow 3/4 kbs ..downloaded about 120mb ...only around 70 mb remaining ...
,druidravi,2007-10-08T20:39Z,Please seed this for some time ..I have only 20mmb left to download and no active seeders..
,druidravi,2007-10-09T07:45Z,Guys please seed this..I have 10 mb left for dwnload and suddenly speed reduced to 300b/sec from 3mb/sec due to lack of seeds....
,druidravi,2007-10-09T22:05Z,Thanks for everyone who seeded it. I am unable to start any quests though . I can start free style game but in the map the quest areas are not clickable ........ anyone knows what to do...
,jslind,2007-11-10T21:57Z,"When I start either MajX.exe or Majesty.exe, it starts loading something, screen goes black - and then I get this Windows XP's error message, basically it CRASHES in the startup! :(

What to do??? I really want this working :("
,jslind,2007-11-10T22:04Z,"""If anyone else have trouble, try disabling DirectDraw in your directX tool, it works for me :)""

How do I do that?? Which dirextX tool? How to access it?"

,hunter3k,2007-12-19T18:44Z,"For those of you having problems with Majesty.  I have tried many different ways with Windows XP and still can't get it to work.  I'm pretty sure that the same problem applies in Vista.  My work around is installing Virtual PC 2007 from Microsoft and putting Windows 98 on that.  Granted, that's a bit extreme but if you want to play the game bad enough then it's worth a shot."
,Rattengift,2008-02-06T09:50Z,AAAAW! Several years since I played this. I love it! thanks!
,Metal_Monkey,2008-09-28T11:22Z,"hay love the game thanks for the upload, no music though any solution? also where is the expansion i seam to only have the original. 

THERE IS NO VIRUS ON THIS DOWNLOAD AND ENJOY IT "
,PancakeJC,2009-01-17T22:55Z,"For people having crashing problems:

I was as well, running majx.exe.

Using a solution from another site, I found that if you deleted binkw32.dll, and ran from majesty.exe, it will run fine.

Also, a problem people might be running into on newer displays/video cards is an insanely fast scroll. If you've run into that problem, try this:

1. Open ""run,"" type ""regedit,"" run.

2. Select HKEY_CURRENT_USER

3. Select Software

4. Select Cyberlore, click on the Majesty folder

5. Double click ""Scrollspeed,"" set value to something lower than 20 (6 works well) hexidecimal.

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the ""Majesty Expansion"" folder.


Hope that helps people. Thanks for the file."

,devicem,2009-04-10T09:51Z,Great torrent. Thanks
,pizzapub,2009-07-12T05:04Z,"installed alright, and went to menu, but menu was messed up and would not actually play, tried on windows vista"
,Kylezo,2009-07-12T23:25Z,"I open it using majestyx.exe, the screen goes black, flashes, and then goes back to normal...nothin opens. wtf."
,Joker49,2009-08-20T11:16Z,"Beware! I scanned this before installing and the installer was dirty with a ""Trojan Generic4 VVX"" that could not be fixed, so I deleted the thing and I will get it elsewhere, don't download this"
,gkup,2011-05-04T01:32Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! This torrent is infected with a trojan and needs to be removed from TPB.
,guserfks,2012-02-21T22:05Z,infected torrent.
