:. about .:
 
Majesty is a unique sim putting you in the crushed velvet hot seat of your
own kingdom. With an epic quest before you, you make the decisions of 
where to build your settlement's guilds and temples.

From these you recruit a varied cast of larger-than-life heroes. 

Each one has a mind of his own and must be enticed to meet your goals,
via rewards you offer and spells you cast. 

Meanwhile you must make sure that your treasury stays flush with cash to 
support these and other outlays necessary to maintain a thriving medieval town.
The fact that you are being barraged by attacks from mythical beasts and fantastic 
creatures doesn't make your job any easier.

Majesty The Northern Expansion is an expansion pack for the "kingdom simulator",
Majesty. It adds new features, levels, and more. -s-t-a-n-d-a-l-o-n-e-
