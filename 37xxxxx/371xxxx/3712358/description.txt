Bottom Live 4 finds Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson bravely and boldly poking their dirty bits
into the start of a new millenium. Armed only with an endless stream of knobgags, gallons of
banana and raisin ouzo and the funniest, most outrageous stage show ever invented!

Filmed during the sell-out 2001 tour we find Richie and Eddie where we left them - stuck on a
Pacific island and still the saddest pair of no-hope losers the world has ever known.Getting by
on bone-crunching nastiness and violently successful accidents the hapless duo encounter an
exploding parrot, experiemt with chainsaw pant removal and indulge in a bout of enthusiastic pig
worrying. It also looks lake they manage to escape the island only for everything to be truly unhinged!

Bottom Live 2001, is explosivley insane and unfettered by any morals whatsoever - disgusting, 
degrading vicious and so bloody funny you will laugh your bollocks off!! (Or tits if you┬┤re a girl)
