,Kamrat Johan,2008-10-02T17:05Z,"Should have read the book, wildcat. It's brilliant. "
,Dmaj87,2009-02-19T00:34Z,"I'm reading the book now. and I must say it's the most fantastic thing I ever laid my hands upon! anyone who is too lazy to not read the book first is missing out on something big!

I myself shall watch this film after finishing the book!

thank you, WinstonSmith6079 :)"

,Fuckault,2009-06-28T20:43Z,"Never knew they made a movie of this.  One of my favorite books ever.  Will probably be disappointed in the movie, as some things will just have to have been cut from the book.

BTW, thanks for the up.  Love your name too, from 1984 or the artist?"
,Fuckault,2009-06-28T20:46Z,"Also to the readers out there.  read ""Closing Time"", the sequel.  Not as funny, but still a good book."
,MisaxMisa,2009-07-20T08:43Z,"""Catch-22"" is certainly one of the funniest novels ever written. I've heard that the movie version leaves out a lot of important story arcs, so I hope that I'm not disappointed by it. It would be a shame to ruin such a fantastic novel."
,ODBC,2010-03-23T12:14Z,Thank you for sharing.
,ghytwembpang,2011-01-05T01:30Z,"I'm really lookign forwards to seeing this, I love the book to dead! Naturally they'd have to cut some stuff/rearrange some stuff but that's true of any book-to-film, and from what I've heard Heller was quite pleased with the way the film came out."
,AshTastic,2011-04-30T06:59Z,"I loved this book when I read it =)
I'm pretty excited for the movie, gonna reread this book too"
