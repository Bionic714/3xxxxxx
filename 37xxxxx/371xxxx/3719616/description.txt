This 1974 musical revolves around the antics of Mame Dennis (Lucille Ball), a fun-loving, wealthy eccentric with a flare for life and a razor sharp wit. Her life is suddenly changed when she becomes the guardian of her late brother's only child, Patrick Dennis. Her adventures take us from the speak-easies of the roaring 20's to the depression following the great Stock Market crash. She is rescued by a wealthy Southern plantation owner (Robert Preston), marries and is widowed suddenly, and through it all, manages to keep things under control. With some help from her dearest friend, Vera Charles (Bea Arthur), she helps keep things at 3 Beekman Place a rousing free-for-all. {Written by John Deming for the Internet Movie Database.}
