The text refers basically to the fact that you can get something like this on Amazon, but will cost you $10 bucks. But that only work on Win95 or Win98. So which stuff do you prefer?.

Everything works brilliantly in XP, haven't tested the modules in 3.0 that require 256 colors (only 10 of them do) and it tends to crash but still worth the nostalgia. Cheers again!"
