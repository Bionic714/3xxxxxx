I wanted to download Oceans Twelve and tried to find PAL - DVD -version.
Then i noticed that there is one that is uploaded today. Good luck, i suppose, and thanks."
,georrge,2007-06-30T03:41Z,"Nice!
I just watched 11 & 13 and they are soo good!
Good timing!"
,Kexbandit,2007-08-11T11:25Z,Great that you upload in one single IMG-file! =D Then I don't have to waste my time in extracting IMG-files. Thanks! =D
,BimBom,2007-10-29T21:48Z,"Like Kexbandit dude said: why uploading a 100 file rar crap when you can upload ONE file? I mean what's the use?
Thanks for the one file upload :D"

,Sleppmegin,2008-02-05T02:32Z,"I dont know why or what it means but i checked the md5sum and they do not match :\ ? But im a noob when it comes 2 that kind of stuff, i just checked for fun to test for the first time."
,Sleppmegin,2008-02-05T02:34Z,or maybe the md5sum value i checked against was actually the torrent file itself.
