,BlackEyedFish,2008-02-15T11:58Z,"If run on an x64 version of windows, it comes up with a dialog box saying, 

""This shareware build does not support windows x64 installations, but the enhanced version does. The install will now exit.""

Anyone know how to emulate 32 bit windows? I've tried running it as windows xp and 2k etc. but still get the error.

IconPackager 3.1 screwed up a load of my Vista icons otherwise I wouldn't be so bothered."
,tonicenergy,2008-02-16T05:01Z,"Ok. I just scanned all the files with AVG Antivirus with the latest antivirus definitions 2/15/08 and no viruses were detected. This file is safe to download. 

Feel free to scan for yourself, it's safe :D"
,t20t,2008-03-18T03:41Z,"Just to be on the same side, I downloaded the actual installation file from stardock and scanned the crack files.  All clean with NOD32, VirusTotal, and virusscan.jotti.org"
,DEC_42,2008-03-22T19:27Z,"Don't listen to that fool clairon, he's probably trying to get dirt on the uploader's name. The entire package is clean.

Scanned with:
ESET NOD32
AVG Antivirus
Spyware Terminator
Spybot S&D
and finally Ad-Aware."
