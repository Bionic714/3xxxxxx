,cainefan,2008-12-16T15:29Z,thx!!!
,jed2009ifpb,2009-01-07T23:45Z,Does anyone know of a ripped compressed version of this movie? I haven't got much of a connection.
,4core,2010-02-15T19:50Z,please seed people .... very low download speeds ..... this is one of the best movies ever made.
,Sunuvagun,2011-12-19T01:38Z,"Unless you speak Spanish, this copy is useless.  The description is NOT correct; there is NO english audio track.  After downloading, I checked it with VLC - it shows only ONE audio stream, and it's in Spanish.  Again, unless you're an hispanophone, save yourself the 2-3 days needed to download this old nag."
,zyzykwy,2012-06-01T03:11Z,"excelent movie.  To get the english soundtrack go to language selection and it is audio track 2, track 1 is the spanish dubbing.  It is seeding at a great rate, I hope I can seed it as fast when I have it all."
,zyzykwy,2012-06-01T07:03Z,I really really hope the seeds stay online until more of us get this.  all the peers left and now it's downloading at a much slower rate.  I've uncapped my upload rate so I can share what I've got but I'm only at 58% so I need the seeds to keep sharing.
