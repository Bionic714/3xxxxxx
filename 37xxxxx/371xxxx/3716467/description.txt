I started my collecting of old games back in -97 and one of the most┬┤difficult tiltles to find was this one. 

Sure, it's quite easy to find the rips, both disk and cd verions. But finding the cd image of this classic game was near impossible. 

Since I found it, I thought I'll let you people have it to. :)



Enjoy one of the best made adventures ever! 
(well, I do like the Monkey Island series more, but thats me :P)
