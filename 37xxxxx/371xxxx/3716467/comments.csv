,hizzern,2007-06-17T15:20Z,"Played this game last year.......one of my favourite games of all times....=) 
But I had a problem with the sound... so I had to play it without it ... =( And the dialog in this game is what makes it a great game ... Did u get the sound to work under XP with this version ?

Thanks anyway =) Great UL"
,hizzern,2007-06-17T15:22Z,Ehm....My trouble with the sound has nothing to do with this torrent.... I haven't played this yet...=)
,themole2,2007-06-17T20:33Z,"win xp has trouble to play the sound back.

,hizzern,2007-06-17T21:44Z,Tx.... I'll check into it when I get a chance

,deusmeister,2007-06-19T00:57Z,"Uhh, what's the difference between a cd image and a rip?"
,ursak,2007-06-19T21:17Z,A rip often only inkludes the gamefiles needed to run the game and many times dont have speech or musik/cutscenes. 
,the_crazy_swede,2007-09-12T17:45Z,is there speach in this one?
,the_crazy_swede,2007-09-12T17:46Z,ZOMG!!!!!!!! laddar ner med max hastighet?! lol BĂ&#x201E;STA TORRENTEN PĂ&#x2026; TPB! thanxsssssssssss
,ursak,2007-09-15T20:55Z,"Yes, it has speech, and music and everything else the cd-version of the game had when released. This is the ""full"" cd-rom game. :)

And thanks, try seeding as much as possible :)"
,ursak,2007-09-21T10:06Z,"Since my computer broke down, I'm not seeding anymore. :("
,nyxko,2007-09-23T11:13Z,use DosBox to play DotT with sound enabled. is a dos emulator used for playing old games under xp. free. http://dosbox.sourceforge.net
,shortstack,2007-10-04T13:02Z,"actually, I used to have the original cd-rom release of this game, and it had a bunch of demos on it to fill in extra space...the actual game took up very little room.  In fact, it was originally released on a handfull of floppy disks, so I KNOW it didn't take up as much as 282 mb.... I'd much rather just get just the game, in a much shorter period of time, then waste time downloading a 14 year old demo of Dark Forces.

Just sayin'."
,ursak,2007-10-29T01:21Z,"Well, ur welcome to find it elsewhere then. I kinda like the ""original"" releases. And btw, the disk-version was without speech. The CD version takes up more space than the disks did, but not a full CD, so ur right about the demos.

Good luck finding it btw, try the-underdogs.info :)"
,Spegma,2007-11-01T05:34Z,Thank you for this. Brings back memories. Works perfect on Windows Vista with the scummvm emulator. Excellent upload! Thanks again.
,Ocified,2008-04-25T19:42Z,"I DLLed this and I couldn't get it to run in Vista right.  I kept getting an error ""This program does not support fullscree.  Please click close to terminate the program.""

I read the thing about a scummvm emulator, but I don't know how to go about using this.  Any help would be greatly appreciated."
,Ocified,2008-04-25T22:06Z,NVM...I got it to work.  good stuff.  
,lucasius,2008-11-25T18:03Z,"Hey ursak,

Thanks for the quality upload, champion effort!

Thanks to all the seeders this download is going nice and fast.

Cheers"
,lucasius,2008-11-25T18:04Z,"All you dudes who have troubles running the game have obviously never used google and expect everything to be done for you.

Look up Scummvm on google.

Thanks again ursak."
,Ontolodox,2009-04-06T02:37Z,"OK, I'm having some issues here...I installed SCUMMVM, used MagicISO to extract the files into a folder, made sure I had the monster.sou, tentacle.000 and tentacle.001 files in said folder, then went to add the game, and SCUMMVM won't find it. I'm using Vista. Can anyone PLEASE help?"
,Ontolodox,2009-04-06T02:51Z,"OK...disregard that. It found the game, even though it wasn't actually appearing in the window. Whoops."
,grubsteak,2009-06-26T18:01Z,Booted it up and was not connecting to any seeds....seed please! really really want to play this and bring back epic nostalgia
,PandemoniumMaster,2009-10-04T14:38Z,"i tried to play this game on DOSBox and music was fine, but whatever i try, i cannot hear sounds and voices! if somebody can help me i would be very thankful! Pleeease HELP"
,wufta,2010-01-26T10:33Z,"worked fine in scummvm for me -- running with XP sp3.  however, i had to change the name of the folder ""DOTT"" to ""tentacle"".  but what is REBEL?  i can't get that to work with scummvm."
,kaimles,2010-04-06T01:49Z,"Well well, what do I find here? I remember I used to play this game on my very first pc. Thanks for sharing this man, you really made my day."
,Pap45murF,2010-04-28T01:06Z,"I used DOSbox and everything works perfectly, including audio and voices.  Just make sure you go into setup (mine ran automatically when I executed dott.exe) and select the soundblaster (or whatever) boxes.  I remember having trouble with the sound back in the day as well, but that was mostly due to the IBM computer I was using."
[T],InternetNinjacy,2010-05-26T19:13Z,"Awesome. Works almost perfectly the only issues are pretty much address in Ursak's post:
