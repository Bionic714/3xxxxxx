Infact when i used this 
the installation wouldn't start.
It would just dissappear.

NOw if i just used the default starter that was in the .iso file.
The installation worked.
Weird .. so i have no idea why this is needed.

If you have the same problem; game will not install, this small file will save you.

I guess there are other ways to fix it, but here is how I did it *lol*:

- mount the ISO file as normal
- open the ""dvd"" / explore
- copy ALL the files and put it in a folder of your choice
- copy this one into the same folder and replace the old Startup file
- then install the game as described in the ISO read me

Hope this could help ^^"
