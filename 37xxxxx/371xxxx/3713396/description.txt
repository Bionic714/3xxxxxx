This bootleg recording was made from 2 shows in Turku and Helsinki Finland on April 4 and 5, 1984. Johnny talks to the audience quite a bit and the band sounds good. However, the quality of the recording is poor. Most of the tracks are with the entire band but the last 9 tracks are Johnny solo on acoustic guitar.
