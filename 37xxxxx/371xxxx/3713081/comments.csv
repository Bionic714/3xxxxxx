,mrspock09,2007-06-13T18:36Z,seed plz. i will seed once i'm done for as long as i can. hope this one works
,Mr Blonde,2007-06-13T18:46Z,"im seeding relax, ive tested it any everything in the game works :D"
,mrspock09,2007-06-13T18:48Z,ok thanks. this should be a great game. cant wait to demolish my friends with songs they've never seen on gh before lol.
,Mr Blonde,2007-06-13T18:58Z,"actually i made a mistake, coop mode and faceoff mode might lock up the game."
,mrspock09,2007-06-13T19:12Z,"ok. with the ones that i've put on gh before, pro face off only worked if i put it on expert for both of us. but some may not work. thanks for letting me know before i try it lol."
,Mr Blonde,2007-06-13T19:26Z,"well yes proface off will work if you both use the difficulties allowed.

so paranoid only allows expert, so youll both need to play on expert

however hotel california allows you to play on m/h/x so you can play on hard mode and the other player can use medium

if you try to play november rain on a difficulty other than expert, it will lock up"
,mrspock09,2007-06-13T19:36Z,ok that clears things up. and then i shouldnt try co-op because you probably didnt make/download the extra part right?
,Mr Blonde,2007-06-13T21:12Z,"yeah dont try coop, i wasnt interested in it so im not sure which songs work and which dont :S"
,lbrunetto,2007-06-13T23:28Z,"NTCS or PAL ??

thanks man!"
,Mr Blonde,2007-06-14T00:08Z,ntsc version
,lbrunetto,2007-06-14T01:57Z,"thanks man, downloading now xD


Bajando!!!! gracias amigo!!"
,GunOfTheMartyr,2007-06-14T02:42Z,"It's Martyr from Blackcats. You own, man.

Quick question though, does hyper mode work?"
,Mr Blonde,2007-06-14T03:59Z,"hypermode should work, i dont see why it wouldnt"
,Saaaaaad,2007-06-14T14:03Z,"*Drools* Fuck yah, great job man. Appreciate it a lot."
,GunOfTheMartyr,2007-06-14T18:50Z,Plays like a dream man. Thanks a ton.
,meto_81,2007-06-14T22:00Z,"cheers mate, works perfectly!

Thanks you :)"
,mrspock09,2007-06-15T02:49Z,"ok i downloaded it and burned it, and it works fine. but pretty much all of the songs that werent in gh or gh2 are all off beat, such as stairway to heaven. but the origional songs seem to be all right, like bark at the moon. any way i can fix this?"
,GunOfTheMartyr,2007-06-15T05:42Z,Paranoid seems to freeze every time I play it.
,Mr Blonde,2007-06-16T04:49Z,"unforunately the paranoid notechart was messed up so it crashes everytime, sorry. all songs i tried so far have no syncing issues but when i play stairway ill be sure to let you know if its just a problem on your end or not."
,Saaaaaad,2007-06-17T05:13Z,"Yah, Godfather theme seems to lock up aswell towards the end. Paranoid locks up straight away. I tried stairway to heaven, timing was fine most of the time, just some of the time the notes were slightly off. The only thing was, the song volume was so low!!"
,Stragd_gh2,2007-06-17T23:02Z,"Hells yeah man, good job!"
,mrspock09,2007-06-18T04:26Z,"ok if its just me that has syncing issues, what burning program did u use to burn the .iso with? i used MediaNow, but i can also use alcohol 120%. "
,Saaaaaad,2007-06-18T09:57Z,"I used Dvd Decrypter, and burnt at lowest speed. Sometimes i do notice some keys are slightly out of sync, but 95% of the time, i find the notes are fine. It's not that noticable, just depends on the notecharts used, some are better than others. I think other than locking up of the 2 songs i mentioned above, everything else works great in this hack, I'm enjoying it a lot, just wish i was a better player...i failed thunderstruck on 1%...ahahaha"
,mrspock09,2007-06-18T16:27Z,ok thanks Saaaaaad. i'll burn it as soon as i can and test it.
,Mr Blonde,2007-06-18T19:05Z,ill be sure to keep all these bugs in mind to straighten them out in the next version :)
,Saaaaaad,2007-06-19T10:21Z,"Umm...one thing i found today, is that some notes don't appear properly. I was playing Tell Me Baby, and there was a part where there's meant to be a long note. It wasn't there, and i could just hear the music in the background. I thought the notechart just didn't have that note, but then the note just appeared out of nowhere, and canceled my multiplier, as if it had been there all along."
,ercoboy,2007-06-27T18:27Z,"Can I get pass ""Paranoid""? So I can continue my career. When the song start i finishes at 0 % (^^). And I can press continue and everything, but the next songs will not appeare. What shall I do? Thanks for all answers.  "
,GuitarHero86,2007-06-30T18:18Z,Can I add my own songs with GHEX?
,kissoh,2007-07-01T19:30Z,"This version truly sucked ass! The sync is totally off and if you would get it synced, it wouldn't matter scince the person that made it are musically impared. Try other hacks of this game instead of this shit."
,GuitarHero86,2007-07-01T21:09Z,kissoh. Please try if you can add own songs with Guitar Hero Explorer
,Metalnight,2007-07-05T00:03Z,"Is there something wrong when song starts without ""Tone Markers"" like Bryan Adams - Summer Of 69....Easy Mode.
Can see in the info that it is expert but why does it pop up in the easy parts?

Works ok other wise."

,Siggens,2007-08-05T19:26Z,"And.. no gunkrizz.. a PS2 game will never work on a 360.. unless you are a crazy coder and hack 360 to play homebrew... and then create a PS2 emulator for it.. Then, you might make it work.."
