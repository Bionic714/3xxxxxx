 :   ~ WELCOME TO HELL                                                           :
 :                                                                               :
 :   ~ During our training in Recondo, we were instructed  that  having  found   :
 :      ourselves at gun point, seemingly with  no  chances  of  survival,  we   :
 :      should smile at  our  foe.  Surprised  by  such  behaviour,  he  would   :
 :      hesitate for a fraction of a second. This  unbelievably  short  period   :
 :      of time meant the fine line between death and life. It  gave  way  for   :
 :      other arguments and we had full cartridges  of  them.  We  would  kill   :
 :      hundreds of enemies this way, leaving behind  dead  bodies,  with  the   :
 :      eyes telling the story of surprise and our smiling faces.                :
 :                                                                               :
 :   ~ By no means was it an ordinary war. Our foe  was  faceless,  bereft  of   :
 :      identity. The whole Vietnam was our enemy. Its climate, terrain,  mud,   :
 :      jungle, mosquitoes and short, weird inhabitants,  armed  with  Chinese   :
 :      weapons and unreal ideals.                                               :
 :                                                                               :
 :   ~ In terms  of  military  strength,  we  outpowered  the  enemy.  We  had   :
 :      state-of-the-art technology, napalm, helicopters,  artillery  support,   :
 :      communications, supplies of equipment. No way we could lost?  Way.  It   :
 :      is hard to imagine any army capable of defeating foe  who  is  nowhere   :
 :      and everywhere at the same time, foe who fights  on  his  own  ground,   :
 :      which for us was hostile, alien and hard to understand. With time,  we   :
 :      learnt some rules of that world,  we  grasped  the  gist  of  fighting   :
 :      there. However, it was primarily the fight for survival.                 :
 :                                                                               :
 :   ~ Ho Chi Minh, the leader of the communists in Vietnam,  once  said:  you   :
 :      can kill ten of my men with the loss of just  one  of  yours,  but you   :
 :      will still lose, and I shall prevail. At the early stages  of  war  in   :
 :      Vietnam, we treated those words as  a  madman's  babble.  Towards  the   :
 :      end, we had to acknowledge they were true.                               :
 :                                                                               :
 :   ~ In October 1967, having spent  some  time  training  at  a  school  for   :
 :      special forces in Nha Trang, I was transferred to a temporary military   :
 :      base in Don Dien, as the leader of a distant recon squad of four  men.   :
 :      We  all  had  been  in  service  for  long,   trained   in   sabotage,   :
 :      communication and intel. We were invisible  to  those  who  themselves   :
 :      tried to be invisible. We were the  assassins  of  killers.  Ready  to   :
 :      bite. Yet, the winter offensive of  North  Vietnam  army  smashed  our   :
 :      teeth.                                                                   :

 :   ~ In 1968, a base located on the hill outside Don Dien  found  itself  on   :
 :      the marching route of a regular  communist  army,  preparing  for  the   :
 :      strike on the ancient, imperial city  of  Hue  -  the Binh  Tri  Thien   :
 :      province capital.                                                        :

 :   ~ Al. Capone used to  say  that  you  can  win  more  if  you  supplement   :
 :      outspoken words with a gun. We were not trained to give  speeches.  As   :
 :      for the guns, we had plenty of them...                                   :
