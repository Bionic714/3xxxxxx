,Bjellesau,2007-06-21T16:18Z,"Thanks for this seed!

FYI:
From Blackomre's Night Official Web Page:
Blackmore's Kingdom - BEWARE, THIS CD IS A FAKE! THIS IS NOT BLACKMORE'S NIGHT!
Also note:
'Blackmore's Kingdom' is not affiliated with Ritchie Blackmore or Blackmore's Night."

,johnnybigoode,2008-04-07T17:28Z,GOD.I LOVE WHEN PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO TAG MP3S OR EVEN GET THE FILENAMES CORRECTLY!!!!!
,Ruinia,2008-07-15T08:08Z,"An extra copy of ""Sake of the Song"" seems to have been spliced onto the end of ""Again Someday"", starting at 1:59. Otherwise, excellent seed, and thank you."
