,Batukhan,2007-10-03T16:40Z,"This is the best game ever.
For those having trouble running it (either in OS X, or in Windows), there's a cross-platform emulator called ScummVM. It can run most of the old LucasArts adventure games."
,corey_6669,2007-10-08T14:29Z,how do you install the game?
,ursak,2007-11-07T02:04Z,"As Batukha said. Run it with scummVM. :) It can be found here: http://www.scummvm.org/ 

They also have a section that tells you how to get the game to run."
,catchaserguns,2007-11-28T11:28Z,The cue on this file is corrupt. Needs to be fixed.
