I mean on some screens the whole picture was only black and white....."
,saveO,2007-06-20T16:44Z,"Not all colors will be black and white, but mostly all of the textures will be shaded with black and white, and some objects will appear with a higher contrast, and some with full color (like blood and artifacts).

Nice to hear LusTnine, yeah it actually gets quite creepy from time to time now, especially at night if you use the r2-renderer (dynamic lighting).

Hope the rest of you enjoy it! And if you want to download it from a server instead of a torrentclient (a bit weird while you already are here, but anyhow) you can get it from http://stalker.filefront.com/file/NUCLEAR_SNOW;80146"
