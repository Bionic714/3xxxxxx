I need to convert a third party image (.sv2i file)
but can't because I don't have a license file.
Please help ???

Thanx charincol for this fine upload"

,Rider23,2007-08-07T19:44Z,Seems that VMWware offers the Starter Edition for free
,pipster2003,2007-10-10T16:06Z,The Simple and Enterprise are the same - its the license file you need

,nws6969,2008-04-07T01:37Z,Where is the license file for this? What good is it without the license file??
