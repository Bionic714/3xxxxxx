This is the full Enterprise ISO of VMWare Converter 3.0.1. You can use this to boot from and create a virtual machine from a real, installed Windows OS. It replaces P2V Assistant. Any questions, go to http://www.vmware.com/products/converter/ for more info.

THIS IS NOT THE STARTER VERSION, IT IS THE FULL BOOTABLE ENTERPRISE ONE.
