Not normally a Western fan, but this looks interesting. Directed by Howard Hawks, also known as the director of: the original version of Scarface (1932); Twentieth Century (1934); Bringing Up Baby (1938); His Girl Friday (1940); the original version of The Thing (1950); Gentlemen PRefer Blondes (1953); Rio Bravo (1959), and so on.

In other words, Hawks has directed a *lot* of great movies.
