,lubli,2007-11-28T23:41Z,"Try some divx, I have no idea about the codec used (I have infinite many on my computer). Or use some codec pack. Or rather use player 'MPlayer'."

,deethedog,2010-02-11T14:38Z,"Oh yeah and i meant to say this is the whole first season.  A/9 V/9.  So...

A story Short
Hans My Hedgehog
The Heartless Giant
The Soldier And Death
Fearnot
The Luck Child
The Three Ravens 
Sapsorrow
The True Bride

None of the super whack Greek myth ones. "
,DarkSorceror,2010-09-11T14:13Z,"deethedog, lubli has the Greek myths separately.

In clearing out my VHS tapes, I found the handful of Storyteller episodes I recorded off air in my childhood and practically put the tape in a vault! It's so precious to me ... at least until I can replace it with the complete collection.

The DVDs can be found literally NO WHERE for sale. Hoping this will be watchable quality :D"
,DarkSorceror,2010-09-14T06:53Z,Excellent quality rips!
