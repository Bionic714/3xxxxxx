Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library

Buffer overrun detected!

Program: ...]\TCSCDA\SCDA-Offline\system\SplinterCell4.exe

A buffer overrun has been detected wich has corrupted the program's internal state. The program cannot safely continue execution and must now be terminated.

,ulumutu,2007-06-19T18:03Z,"Hey Dopeman, enjoying your great work.

I'd like to ask if you could head over to the mininova forum and then to the > Torrents chat > Games > Problems & Questions Section.

Theres a thread about your Two Worlds release.
People would like to know whether they should wait or not.
Just to straighten things out :)"

 Greetings fellow pirates.

 There is indeed a new enemy amongst torrents and they are trying to control
 all good gaming torrents everywhere. Leeching and dumping data, not sharing
 a bit of data, which is making it near impossible to download many torrents.

 I have included a dopeman_blocklist.txt file. YOU MUST load this file to
 Peerguardian as an addtional blocklist -or- load the file to whatever means
 of IP blocking you have available to your BT Client.

 If you do not, you will simply be sharing data to these cowards and not other
 legit torrent users trying to download. 

 Please try to understand the importance of this. It must be used to begin
 saving game torrents everywhere. This is a new enemy. We must do our best 
 to fight back to preserve our freedom of sharing. 

 Please use the blocklist and share it anyway you can.

 dopeman"

,Diceman_,2010-02-27T12:51Z,"I finally got through the whole game and found a fix for the lack of projection shadow while setting up Pandora Tomorrow!.
You need to add a command line -shadowmode=projector into the shortcut on your desktop (same procedure as enabling cheat codes on some games)."

Works great on Windows 7 32-bit. I didn't encounter any problem whatsoever."

Rather good download speed."
,gofreemovies,2010-09-23T04:41Z,I'm not able to start the game. Do I need to unzip the files into the system folder and then run the EXE file to begin the application? Any help is much appreciated.
,MaxMouseG,2010-10-21T05:30Z,"dopeman sucks never believe nothing he says when he says nothing is ripped. I had problems with every single game I downloaded from him.. For example when downloading his games you will get missing textures, sounds, crashes,freezes, Character AI acting so stupid thats its impossible to continue in the game normally."
,MaxMouseG,2010-10-21T05:50Z,"And kottfers is a dumbass guys so ignore his comment about the System requirements. This game was made in 2002 and if anybody told you a game from 2002 requires 1gb of a ram is a fucking idiot and you should just ignore them before they spread more of their stupidity. This game requires only:

256 Ram

64MB video card so it supports really old graphics cards.

Graphics Cards Supported
Nvidia GeForce2 Ti/Ultra/Pro/GTS/MX400/MX
Nvidia GeForce3 family
Nvidia GeForce4 family
ATI Radeon 8500/9000/9500/9700
Matrox Parhelia"
,zippyderppyguy,2010-12-07T21:52Z,"MaxMouseG, That's odd. I never had an issue with the dopeman's rips. Maybe your system has to many software conflicts.... 

Computers are tricky, one prog in conflict can screw any chance of playing the simplest games. As for system needs, always take recommended and multiply that by a factor of two. It should run smooth if you beat the living shit out of their recommended requirements.

If you don't, expect hiccups and sofware instability... So a GIG!!! isn't really that far fetched for a game that only needs 256 MB of RAM... Especially on Vista of Win 7 ( both are such failure os's ).

P.S. Works well, thatnx dopeman :) "
