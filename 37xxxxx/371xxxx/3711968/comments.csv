,lezilver,2007-06-13T13:03Z,"VAR Kan man få tag på Povl Dissing ""Lys og Varme"" skriven av Aage Aleksandersen (Åge Aleksandersen?) 

Min far skulle bli så glad om jag kunde få fram den. Han satt och lyssnade på radio en morgon och då hörde han den låten. Sen dess har han pratat om den hela tiden.

Har kontaktat Sveriges Radio, de är dem som spelar låten på radio. Men de kan bara ge information om artisten och skivan, inte sälja vidare. Har sökt på cdon.com, Ginza, amazon men inget resultat....

Finns det nån nu nån som sitter och håller på låten ""Lys og varme"" och som framförs av Povl Dissing? Skulle vara evigt tacksam om nån la upp den här på TPB! =)"
,erectile,2007-06-13T18:13Z,"Lezilver > I cant find it on the net anywhere, but theres a link to where you can buy it here : http://www.last.fm/music/Various+Artists/Dejlig+dansk

its a whole CD with povl dissing and those dudes, including Povl Dissings version of the song you want :P"
,msevil,2007-06-13T19:29Z,"erectile

So, you know what...?

The link says ""buy this record"" and then they linked me to amazone.com. And amazone doesn't have it... aaaargh

Damn... So close. But thanx anyway, there's still hope :D

Where are you from btw? "
,erectile,2007-06-13T19:54Z,"oh damnit... sorry msevil and lezilver.. :S my bad xD


Ill try searching again :P


Im Danish, right next to you :)"
,erectile,2007-06-13T20:01Z,"ok riight, i found this swedish site here, I have NO IDEA what-so-ever what they are talking about, but it linked when i searched on ""povl dissing - Lys og Varme"".. http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p4/nyhetssidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=1027&Nyheter=&artikel=1361581


and then i found this site with the original one from Åge--something-- xO

,msevil,2007-06-13T20:14Z,"erectile

I'm so sorry, i forgot to tell you, it's still me, lezilver and msevil are the same person, or, no not really, but this is my own account :D

So, danish huh? Do you know why there's so hard to find the song? Did Povl just sang it once and never again, or what? hehe

I haven't heard this verson of Lys og varme 
by Povl myself, I've only heard the other versions, the one from Åke Aleksandersen, where he performed the song live,  and then, of course, I've heard ""Vikingarna"". I must say liked Åke's version more ;-)
"
,msevil,2007-06-13T20:22Z,"Nope, the song lys og varme isn't there eighter.. not performed by Povl anyway.

I'm telling you, there's no way we're gona find it on the net :(

Did i tell you, erectile, how thankfull I am? It's very kind you helping me out =)

Thank youuuuu! =)


"
,msevil,2007-06-13T20:40Z,"Btw, this link.....

http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p4/nyhetssidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=1027&Nyheter=&artikel=1361581


goes to Sveriges Radio, and they where the ones who played that stupid song... and now they're telling me that they can't help me find it. They have the song in their archive, but they can't sell it. And they have no clue where I can find it. 

There should be some law, telling the radio stations that they can't play music that the listeners can't buy on the net or in the store... so if i can't find the song in the stores, the radio station MUST sell it to me :D Or something..."
,erectile,2007-06-13T22:03Z,"I have the perfect plan xD this is what you do;


only works if that radio station has an online service XD

First; Download a radio-ripper thing, so when they play the song, you can click ""GIMME THAT SONG"" and then the ripper will take the song :D


perfect :P

and you might have to request it from them first, to play it :P"
,msevil,2007-06-14T11:50Z,"Youuu are SO smart!

I will steal it from them.. suckers! :D

Now I have to find that radio-ripper thing... hmm"
,erectile,2007-06-14T23:30Z,"Msevil > might i suggest http://www.stationripper.dk/modules/news/


;D I asume you could use that, even though thats a danish site, you will understand, since your swedish :D"
,erectile,2007-06-14T23:44Z,my bad... http://www.stationripper.com/ is the one you want
,erectile,2007-06-14T23:48Z,"and just in case of you being a internet-asshole, you can get a crack/keygen here http://www.keygen.ms/cracked_warez/s_10/


:D


happy stealing.. though if they play it online, it is actually not illegal to ""steal"" it :S"
,erectile,2007-06-15T10:11Z,"To everyone > I can no long be seeding this file, nor others i might have uploaded, the reason being is that my dad just twisted my nuts because i took up all the bandwith XD"
,msevil,2007-06-20T10:39Z,"erectile 

Hey you =)

That radio-ripper thing doesn't work for me :(

I don't know what to do now... Actually, I'm starting to think about dating some guy on Sveriges Radio. But then I came to think about it and I'm not THAT desperate :P

Sadly though, it seems to be the only way to get it....

Anyway, thanx for the help man!"
,erectile,2007-06-29T00:09Z,"Well then i cant help :/ And i cant use Torrents anymore.. lolZ XD only msn, so ill Rarely check here "
,jespek,2007-07-19T11:09Z,"seeda tak, jeg vil også lytte på Poul og Benny"

,Discographer,2008-10-30T13:29Z,"til Lezilver

Har du fundet Lys og Varme med Dissing og Brazz Brothers?

Det er en norsk udgivet CD-2, hvor en lang række kunstnere synger Åke Alexandersons sange. Povl Dissing synger kun det ene nr.

Jeg har en extra CD-2 til salg, hvis du stadig er interesseret.
