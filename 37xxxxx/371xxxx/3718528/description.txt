From a short story by Kurt Vonnegut. Christopher Walken is a shy hardware store employee. But whenever he takes a part in a local amateur theater production, he becomes the part completely--while on screen. Susan Sarandon is new in town, a lonely itenerant telephone company employee. On a whim, she auditions for and gets the part of Stella to Walken's Stanley when the theater group does A Streetcar Named Desire. Before anyone realizes the problem, she falls deeply in love with the sexy brute, not knowing what the real man is like.

just a heads up - there are occasional audio sync problems ( a couple secs here and there). this is not the avi file. the original dvd has these problems and are probably the result of the obviously low budget. for me, they do not distract from the enjoyability. read a review of the dvd (and its shortcomings) here:http://www.reel.com/movie.asp?MID=7217&buy=closed&PID=10123047&Tab=reviews&CID=18#tabs 

Enjoy and PLEASE seed
