,djnforce9,2008-05-16T03:56Z,"I'm surprised Discoland wasn't in this collection. That's as pure an old skool Happy Hardcore song as ""Foxx - Somebody Scream"". Anyhow, nice collection nevertheless. These are the kinds of HH music I like. I never liked the newer stuff at all (e.g. Happy 2b Hardcore)"

,stokeben,2011-05-15T13:10Z,"Hi thanks for taking the time to put these on here but there far from classic's. Each to there own n that but a hardcore remix of ""who the hell is Alice!!????"" I can't imagine people liking that or is it me?? Cheers anyway"
,bilbo_blaggins,2011-05-19T14:58Z,"you happy fans are going to hate me, but you guys ruined the scene for in the early 90s with your white gloves round glasses and bandana's sporting very pilled up contorted faces, theres was very few bangers from that genre and a hell of alot of cheese, big up the jungle tekno, jungle and d&b that emerged to take over                                "
,bilbo_blaggins,2011-05-19T14:59Z,"@ mashsta, your a bit clueless mate dingybat was being sarcastic"
