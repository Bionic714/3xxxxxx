,zorchon,2008-08-20T19:39Z,"Great torrent, There were 1 or 2 files I didn't have. But you've also missed a couple:
2002.07.15 from ""Duel""
2006.02.14 (Perhaps added later: a second cover page for Pibsummer night dream.)
2007.05.11 (Just a notice saying he's getting back to the story. But a good picture of Dru.)

I've got them all saved as .gif, and will be making a torrent from that. For those who don't wish to wait, gocomics(dot)com has done something foolish:
ALL their archives are retrievable!
go to your favorite comic, ""copy image location"" (which I can do with Right-Click of the mouse) and you'll then have something like:
picayune.uclick. com/ comics/pib/2002/pib020715. gif
I then made a html page for four months worth, and ""Saved the page to view offline.""

I don't suppose you have any sundays from 9CL? I missed a few over the summer. :-( "
