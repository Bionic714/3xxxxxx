,quezicotl,2008-07-02T00:13Z,"obviously fuckin'  fake, WAKE UP DUMBASSES. A game like this would take up atleast a gig, minimum. It's only 7.97 MEGABYTES, the average size of a very long song.  Jesus F'n Christ, to the person yelling ""Seed Plz"", sounding just like a fuckin hippie."

,Lobotomize,2008-08-12T05:28Z,"you dont open it in your desktop, you open it in your file directory. which is usually PRogram Files > Warcraft III

put the crack in there and then start it up, it should work"

,darknodar,2008-12-12T16:44Z,well ive installed the games and added the crack and the eeurobattle.net server but i cant connect to Battle.net.Is the fault that i have patch 1.21b?
,Katari475,2008-12-23T09:15Z,"The problem is you have to dl both the iso's of RoC and TFT in order to get the euroloader to work online for you. Hell, you might as well buy the game unless you can find a good torrent that still host WC3 iso.
I've had no luck"

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4469087/Warcraft_III_Reign_of_Chaos__The_Frozen_Throne___Update_Patch_Wa

started it on christmas eve night and it was done by the time I sat down christmas day night.  installs perfectly.

downloading this torrent now to see if the server hack works.  even if its not battle.net you play on, a private server is just as good, thats how I still play WoW, why pay blizzard when private servers can be just as fun."
