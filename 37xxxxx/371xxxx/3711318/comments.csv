However, the classic Terminator films are great, to us who grew up when they were released they might even be some of the best ever made. This film though, is only entertainment.
Peace out.."

This one sounds even better! So much thought and research went into it.

I have one gripe against fan editors - WHY DO YOU GUYS ALWAYS RELEASE 4 GB??? 

Honestly, we have divx and xvid. There is so much bandwidth wasted on these giant releases. 

Also, such a large release is never seeded long. I miss lots of fan releases because zero seeders - I suspect if the videos had been 700MB in size there would be seeders for a long time. 

I wonder if I will be able to watch this release? Will I be able to get all 4 GB ? We'll see.

700 MB would have come down so much faster."

A+

Please release this as a 700 MB Xvid, soon there will be no more seeders and no one will be able to see this excellent cut.

,download2029,2008-04-13T14:53Z,"Thanks for the nice comment spystyle. I know someone else has done a mp4 release (about 700 mb I thought) of my fanedit, I don't know if it's still seeded. I myself am not planning to a divx release, and currently I'm still seeding this DVD release.

However, with my upcoming Terminator 2 3D DVD set, I fear that I might not seed this anymore with as much speed as I can seed it now, because I will give my Terminator 2 3D more seeding priority. Hopefully other people who have downloaded this fanedit are nice enough to seed it in the future..."
,machine458,2008-06-15T00:24Z,"MAN! When i first saw this movie at the opening at the Cinema i was really disepointed it was so...for kids in a way sayd, you could see James Cameron was no where in this movie. Any terminator movie withowt James Cameron directing it is dogshit, Jonathan Mostow blew it up with T3, even so after this remake of the movie, it turned out to be a hell of a movie, thank you to all who re-made this movie and made it a pleasent viewing one. Thank you for the upload man, you RULE! 2 thumbs up for you :)"
