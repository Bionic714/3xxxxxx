:. about .:

In Sonic Riders, Dr. Eggman challenges Sonic and his friends to a 
Worldwide Grand Prix, and the prize for coming out on top is an 
ultra-rare Chaos Emerald! Gliding on air boards which are 
performance-oriented for each playable character - gamers will 
experience a heightened sense of sports-style racing tension as
Sonic and his pals perform tricks and stunts over treacherous 
wide-open terrain.Sonic and friends speed through tracks on air
boards, using individual special moves to strike down opponents. 
Air is a big element of Sonic Riders. Your board's "fuel" source is air. 
You can fill up your air at various points on the course, but to race well 
youll have to use another means of replenishment: performing tricks
with your board. You'll also want to make use of turbulence from racers
who are in front of you.
