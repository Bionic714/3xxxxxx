,amit_garg_ips_gandu,2008-08-03T19:49Z,"One tends to develop a short memory with regard to Muslim excesses, huh? Their conquest of India several centuries ago wasn't exactly with flowers, you know. Ooh, you Muslims! May our Monkey god pounce on your testicles and infect your groin with fleas while our snake god explores your colon for yesterday?s lunch! The desecration and destruction of our erotic Khajaraho Temples, the proud forerunners of contemporary porn, adorned with hand carved idols in every conceivable acrobatic pose depicting juicy coital abominations including manage Ă  trois, orgies, voyeurism, S&M, bestiality, and other really cool preoccupations. A sacred part of our culture made taboo with the pretext of propagating conservative ""morals"" as if we weren't otherwise worthy since we worship snakes, monkeys, elephants, cows, and Lingam and Yoni (affectionate terms of reference for penis and vagina). 

What about the mass voluntary conversions of us idol worshipping Hindus to monothesistic Islam? (All together, now! Can you say, ""BOORING""?). So now, it's Pay Back Time! As far as the US's post 9-11 anti-Muslim crusades into Bosnia, Iraq, Afghanistan, and soon Saudi Arabia, etc., we Hindus had nothing to do with appointing puppet Muslim leaders there or fueling the Sunni ? Shiah rift. Muslims will kill each other off anyway; the US is just helping them along. We Indian Hindus have our own nuisances here: The Christians, Muslims, Untouchables, Undesirables, etc. (methodically being classified as ""Terrorists""/Fair Game). Yep! Pencil-prick Modi is da Man wit da Plan: Da Dyke of The Reich for pogrom for da scum! No, not Eliot Ness?s Untouchables, Stupid! We?re talking about the Caste System here ? those on the Ground Zero level. Jai Bharat and the Privileged Elite!"
