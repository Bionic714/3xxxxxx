,nilpferdkoenig,2007-09-14T21:36Z,"Don't download this game if you don't have a gamepad or better yet, a joystick. The mouse controls really, really suck."
,nilpferdkoenig,2007-09-19T00:26Z,"Just right click on the Blazing Angels Folder and click on ""change name"" or whatever. Just Fill in BA instead of whatever is there. Worked for me and I'm running Vista."

,Nuliorel,2008-01-07T13:23Z,"Tricky copy protection needs a skilled user to beat it, lamers just suck :)"
,retawd,2008-01-29T23:57Z,"If you're having trouble installing on Vista, this worked for me.  Use SettingApplication.exe to set the game up the way you want it, but if you get ""cannot run Blazing Angels"" error go to the bin file and run MainR.exe instead.  The game will start and as you type a profile name there will be no sound, but once you actually get into the airfield and start the training mission the sound will be perfect and the game will run just as it should.   Thanks [dopeman] for the game."
,Busta-Rhymes,2008-01-30T17:09Z,"hi ive got i probleme im able to launch the game but when i want to start the training its load and load and when i chek the task manager its say the game not respond       it block when the 2 screen of aircraft about camera  appear

,domifanvcr,2008-03-24T04:49Z,CHeers for the download - actually for my Dad to enjoy more than me.  Only problem is I get it to run - create my profile and start the training and then all I get is screen of various shades of brown.....  I hear the commentary from Joe and I can shoot and start to fly but no graphics other than a brown screen and when I shoot only black - any thoughts?
,abyssmo,2008-04-06T13:52Z,"Hey dopeman i'm downloading your torrent now but i have a question

,rd31,2009-01-20T10:17Z,"game works fine, the installer doesn't work but all you have to do after extraction is double click on MainR inside the bin file to play "
,rd31,2009-01-22T17:57Z,but be warned...this game plays terribly with a mouse and keyboard and BA for the pc has known compatiblity issues

,JeffAndrey28,2009-12-12T15:49Z,"....mmmmm....,I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS:D!1.tHIS GAME IS FULL?
2.tHIS GAME WORKS?"
,termite43,2010-09-24T21:00Z,"Windows 7 x64, GeForce 9800 GTX+
The game only runs in a window - therefore I have no controls.  The game has no options to change resolutions.  It can't be played."
,Jeb180,2010-10-21T04:03Z,"Yes, thank you very much for this torrent. I do have a couple of questions though, and I don't expect to get an answer because this is an old game, but when I followed the instructions and copied the game to another folder, error screens for dll plugins show up. I have fixed the graphics dll error and the sound dll error, but when start the game, no music or sound is audible. Thank you for you consideration, and I would appreciate it if you could help me with my problem"
,zippyderppyguy,2010-11-21T06:41Z,"Course it's full and course it works, this is a dopeman torrent man, they always work and always full to the hilt!! 

P.S. Thanks again dopeman!"
,Frederick930,2010-12-15T15:54Z,"Guys, i got a REEEALY annoying problem. I saw people can choose their planes before mission on youtube, but i can't! Why is that? please! help me! i wanna use another ship but not allowed to!"
,Frederick930,2010-12-16T06:28Z,"Dopeman! i got another problem! on midway: opening moves! After i destroy the bomber, the game just stops.. i already tried to land, but there was no more objective, no cutscene, no nothing! just free fly, i can't end the mission!!!

And i still can't choose planes on Missions! please help me!"
,karasu24,2011-02-25T03:58Z,"Works great.  Was the music ripped as well?  Anyway, great torrent, great compression.  I'll probably be seeding forever.  Thanks!"
,OndrejB,2011-04-08T22:29Z,everything is working perfect but i have no voices in game...sound effect are working but no voices :/ wtf :D
,suko19833,2011-05-21T09:30Z,"the thing is that this game need the DirectX version that came in the real DVD, I don't know why, but you can still download the latest version of DirectX 9.0c (like I did) and the game has no sound when in the menu, but the sound when playing it works perfect. If you need another DLL just download it (Google) and put it in ""windows\system32"".
I'm still using Windows XP SP2, if this game worked for me it can also work for you. thanks Dopeman!"
,wildmint,2011-07-07T22:52Z,"Damn it! 
I place ""Blazing Angels Squadrons of WWII"" in other folder and it doesn't work! ;/"
,Millor1,2011-07-12T03:30Z,"Works great. Just download to 1 folder, then extract the .rar to a completely different folder... once its extracted go to the bin folder and the actual game is titled ""MainR"" and just click on that and the game will launcher so no need to mess with the installer... however in the main folder is the ""Settings Application"" and thats for setting the resolution and fullscreen and all that. I had trouble opening it the first time but eventually it popped up. As for the gameplay its definately better than heroes over europe if you've played that... With the right control scheme its definately playable and second nature with a mouse and keyboard."
,Millor1,2011-07-12T03:38Z,"Also if you put a check on the fullscreen box in the settings it actually turns off fullscreen apparently, also if it says the your drivers aren't up to date you can probably ignore that, I did and it works fine. Controlling  the plane pitch with the mouse alone and trying to dogfight with that is pretty hard without a trackball mouse, I like to use the mouse and have pitch up and down set to R and F so you can go sideways and do tighter turns to get behind the enemy."
,Lori123321,2011-08-01T18:13Z,"I unrared BASWW2.7z then I started SettingsApplication.exe just like you said I clicked play but I got black screen and immediately got a ''dont send'' error
What to do now ?????"
