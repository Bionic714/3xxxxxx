Creatica -The Early Years (with the London Symphony Orchestra)

I\'m grateful to introduce this group. A trully gem on its own.
Creatica is a talented music band influenced by Craig Amstrong, Massive Attack, Orbital, Wim Mertens and others composers from the modern era.

It\'s a fascinating mixture of rock-classical music-avantgarde electronica With the rich textures of the London Symphony Orchestra in many songs.

Very good. This collection includes a very rare videoclip from their first days called \"Massive Blood Loss\". The lead vocals are Marionna (ex singer of Weather report), beautiful singer born in Szentendre, a little town near the city of Budapest, and the well known among the Bristol underground movement: Andromeda Scar. The brain behind the compositions is Sir David Withe.

The songs of Nina Von Braun aren\'t on this compelling collection but You can find them on \"Creatica: the works\". Enjoy the experience.
The bitrate of the songs it\'s high quality. The songs deserves it.
