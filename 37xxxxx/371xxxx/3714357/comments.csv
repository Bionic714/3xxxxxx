IMDB says this is 99 minutes long. Why is your version only 51 minutes?

There are about a dozen differnent Wind in the Willows cartoon/movies out there.  The one you are referring to on IMDB is a made for TV version.  The actual run-time of this one is actually about 45 mins, the remaining 6 min is previews for other movies by Digi-View.  Here is a link to a picture of the DVD jacket:  http://www.whoishotnow.com/cgi-bin/amazon.cgi?input_item=B000FDSHB6&input_search_type=image"
