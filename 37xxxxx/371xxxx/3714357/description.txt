Runtime about 51 minutes.  The quality is ok, and sorry the sound isn't the greatest, but hey, that is what the original DVD is like!!  I ripped it myself and its just as good as the original DVD, same picture resolution and everything.  Some DVD rips give you just a tiny little picture... I hate that.
