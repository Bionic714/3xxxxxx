i make this 6kb torrent with flasget, then upload.
then donwload this torrent with flashget too, 
pause all except this download, but allways get 0kb/s download speed.
according to my ISP, my connection is ADSL with 384kbps down and 64kbps up. but actually i get max 35kbps download speed.
Running in my PC is WinXP from Indianhak, deactivate AVG firewall, deactivate SpywareTerminator.
What's wrong??

,wheellee,2007-06-17T04:22Z,"OK, HERE IT IS:
Installation:
-unrar 
-run setup.exe to install, C:\Program Files\DietMP3 recommended
-run run_to_reg.exe to patch (it will remove 15 times process limit)
-done

Description:
It's about qualilty and quantity.
Reduce MP3 file size up to 4 times from original CD Quality to Tape Quality,
but will loss the quality.
So dont delete original files before test the new one.
Suitable for recorded voice because quality is not really important, maybe.
For musics? it's about music collector, not music lover."
