Look for the rat turds at walter reed hospital if you want to know what a govt controlled health care nirvana would be like.....

Fuck Moore"
,Junx,2007-06-18T18:49Z,And look at the awful US system to see something *much* worse!
,timelord,2007-06-19T06:28Z,"duhprane: I know you're just a troll, and this is probably a waste of my time .... but still:

Having lived both in the US and Europe, I'm amazed at the attitude of some Americans towards government run health care. Health care in Europe is cheaper (for society as a whole, not just the individual), yet covers more people. Europeans live longer and are healthier. The same goes for Canada. 

The US is the only major wealthy country that does not have comprehensive health care for it's citizens. The US system is, however, great for doctors and insurance companies ... the bureaucracy at an american hospital is mind-boggling and at least 10x worse than what you get in Sweden, where hospitals are government-run.

As for Walter Reed: That's what happens if you let the _military_ run a hospital ... not exactly their area of expertise, now, is it?"
,freeYRmind,2007-06-19T14:02Z,"Being an American that recently moved to Europe I can tell you why we don't trust socialized medicine.  Because we have been brainwashed from the day we were born to believe we have the best government on the planet and that government is incompetent.  These two things seem to be contradictory, but most Americans don't think about that.  It allows people to be for and against a thing at the same time.  
But seriously, look at the syphilitic retard they have running the place now.  He told Americans government was bad, then he created the worst government since Pol Pot.  Would you trust that sadistic bastard with your health?  He can barely read My Pet Goat.
I agree with the French doctor in Sicko, the Americans can not institute a socialized system.  They will have to continue to waste trillions of dollars to get substandard care.  I guess 37th in the world and the lowest life expectancy among any western country is just fine by them."
,kongdvd,2007-06-19T19:26Z,"Michael Moore finally now says 9/11 Could Be Inside Job:

""bombs in WTC buildings... missing video of Pentagon attack...""

,freeYRmind,2007-06-20T20:11Z,"Can't compare the two since I didn't download the tarred version.  This is a clean version without skips.  If this was something like Star Wars, I would suggest going for highest quality.  There are amazing special effects or stunning panoramic views.  Just simple truth, and cleverly written prose. "
,Da Blues Mon,2007-06-29T19:15Z,"Terrific quality...  Thank You Michael... I'm an American who is painfully, beginning to see the light!"

,object16,2007-07-07T00:25Z,"I watched Sicko.   I am a Canadian, and I am outraged by what is happening in US.  That
country calls itself Christian??? They ignore
that Jesus was the founder of Christianity.
He said ""What you do for the least of these,
you do for me"".  They worship mammon and
claim they worship the Lord."

,johnnyfacker2,2007-07-11T02:26Z,"I live in Canada and our Healthcare System is substandard best of times.  People in hospitals don't care for patients needs or necessities because they're not being directly paid by the patient, and they feel like they have no one to answer to.  It's not all that simple."
,sh4d3z,2007-07-11T10:07Z,"alot more than just the health care needs to change in this country... and the world
fuck capitalism! marx had it right"
,o_motors,2007-07-14T05:44Z,"Communism, like it once was in Russia and the Eastern European Block was nothing else then international banker?s established, huge and badly run Corporation in which few members of the board of directors (read heads of party politbureau) had all control over national resources against which they borrowed money, while the workers, doctors, engineers and all other professional (fictitious shareholders) was placed in the same basket and received only what ?members of the board of directors? thought was enough for each of them. 

Imperfection in the society comes from people?s lack of will to grow and become responsible for all their do?s and does?. What the capitalism tends to do better then Communism is reward greater effort and private initiatives, but in a less permissive environment that is being created buy ever growing number of international mega conglomerates and corporations, this will become increasingly difficult, thus causing more and more people to embrace the corporate slavery, just as seen in the movie Matrix. If there is one viable alternative to this madness, it?s the Swedish type of social democracy, which exists on high taxation of these who got plenty of money. Now think for a moment, when would US wealthy agree to such of changes? I don?t see it coming any time soon. "
,Zensch,2007-07-15T15:48Z,"Nothing in this movie really surprised me, it just reminded me of how reality is. I'm not naive enough to not believe that most corporations (I know there are a few who actually take ethic and moral stands) do anything but attempt to maximize their profits regardless of what area they are working with.

With that being said, I think that Michael Moore as usual plays too much on emotion and sympathy rather than presenting the cold hard facts. It feels more like watching a soap opera than a documentary.

I don't mean to show any disrespect to those who are in situations like shown in the movie."

,sneeblewhopp,2007-08-06T01:27Z,"Personally, I relate with Moore's oppinions on healthcare here in America & applaud his unique insite & the way he's put his movie together for us all to help expose this human attrossity taking place here in the US everyday. I'm a strong grown man, yet I felt tears whell up & I got a lump in my throught when those 911 workers finally got someone to help them in of all places....CUBA....that's outragious!!! Pick which finger you can afford to keep???....sickening!!! It's a sad day when I don't wanna live here anymore. NM could give a rat's a**...along with America, if I live or die.....as long as they keep getting my taxes & Keep me in the dark while they spend my hard-earned money on $400.00 hammers & wars that nobody believes in, nor supports...& God only knows what else!"
,BloodyMess,2007-08-07T14:12Z,"I read in an article in a Norwegian news paper (E24.no) that he was so overwhelmed by the Norwegian health system that he decided to not show it in the movie because the Americans wouldn't believe it. ""If you have sirten deceases you get one week vacations south of Spain, all paid, once a year"" he said.
