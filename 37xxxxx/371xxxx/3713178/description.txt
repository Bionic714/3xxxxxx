Type: .mds

Size: 1.26 GIGS

Why? Ok I just downloaded Supreme Commander for my little brother... I was playing it and couldnt beleve it was made by the makers of Total Annihilation(1997). I used to love that game. I went looking for it online.. found no torrents... Found it in my bedroom and decided to rip it and post it up. turns out I got a crack for it off gameburnworld.com but you don't need it... If you mount it, it stil runs... But i put the crack in just in case... Also multiplayer works great... me and a couple friends i sent the .mds to play it regualary...
