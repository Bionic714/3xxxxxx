with the keymaker right??"
,magno23,2007-06-16T07:49Z,Says its not valid... it is a proper 114 key though... so i dunno... any other programs i could try?
,magno23,2007-06-16T21:18Z,OOOHH ok i got it... i think. Ok thanks a ton for the help bro.
,magno23,2007-06-16T21:38Z,Now i just need to figure out how to work this thing... Heh nothing i cant figure out.
,[Maga]Zine,2007-06-16T22:27Z,o its activated then?? just run alcohol 120% and drag and drop the mds files u got from me then mount to vertial drive.. that should do it.. haha got it???
,magno23,2007-06-18T08:00Z,Well yes it is activated...but i have to reinstall Alcohol 120% each time i wanna use it... other wise it'll take me right back to the page that asks for the Serial Number... So i dunno... kinda annoying.
,[Maga]Zine,2007-06-21T08:11Z,really that weird..????? no clue then man.. try daemon tools its free google.com
,black curtian,2007-08-26T11:59Z,"ok well TA was partially made by the same people as SupCom. by partially I mean Chris Taylor was the designer of both.
with TA he was the lead designer for Cavedog Entertainment. In 1998 Chris Taylor founded his own gaming company Gas Powered Games where he is the CEO and brain behind the titles of Dungeon Siege series and SupCom. "
