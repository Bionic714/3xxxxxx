,ursak,2007-08-19T15:05Z,"Have you tried running it in compabilty mode? What windows do you use? I've installed it on my WinXP Home Ed. without any problems and the game runs as it should. 

If the isnatll works without problems and the error shows when you try to launch the game. Try installing the update first. 

Instead of telling you too ""google"" the net for the update I'm such a friendly fella so I put it up for you here: http://www.ursak.se/filer/DeusExMPPatch1112fm.exe 

This update also adds multiplayer mode to the game so get some friends together :) Oh, I really hope this solves it for you. "

Please people, try searching for it atleast once before asking. Most dll's and stuff can be found on the net.

And besides. I dont know what uve done wrong, but this game works ""as-is"" on my PC with WinXP.

,quentin132003,2008-05-05T15:17Z,Ok to answer my own question and a few similar ones this game more than likely needs to be ran in compatibility mode.  To do this find the .exe file in the program files in the Deus Ex system folder and go through the properties.  I ran mine in compatibility mode for windows 95 and it now works perfectly.  This is a great torrent and after installing has worked almost flawlessly way better than the GOTY torrent.
