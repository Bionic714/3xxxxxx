,Haraldur93,2007-09-06T13:57Z,"You are easily amused, and its definetly not the best electro dance ive heard. 

Check out some of the Goa psy trance artists, and think again. 

*Justice is still a nice group, 3-4 good songs. nothing else."
,rjd22,2007-09-11T23:40Z,harald: trance sucks
,PPKLP,2007-11-21T12:43Z,"@rjd22
I agree, trance sux! But Haraldur is right. Goa (or psy-trance) isn't as lame as real trance... Go and check out some DJ's like 'Juno Reactor' or 'Infected Mushroom' You'll see their not boring..."
,marcusn,2007-11-21T21:47Z,"yeah i luuv electro and house music, but this album is not more than mediocre. 3 out of 5."
,nhL1991,2007-12-04T21:16Z,"I really like Justice, the song D.A.N.C.E is just great, and a nice looking vid as well. 
French people have really taken music to the next level, i expect french music will become bigger in the future."
