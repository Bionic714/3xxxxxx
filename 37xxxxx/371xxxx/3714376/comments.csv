,Razath,2009-01-06T22:28Z,"If this is of better quality than all the other ones out there (which have crappy, crappy, crappy video quality) I sure as hell don't mind spending time unpacking the files. Here's to hoping this won't be yet another disappointment."
,Razath,2009-01-08T15:35Z,"After DLing it and watching a few episodes, I can say this is of excellent quality. Thanks for saving me from watching this in low resolution, choppy video and out-of-synced sound.

This torrent is recommended."
