I don't have FSQuality's Japan, but if you use all the airports from Simmer's Sky together with this freeware Japan mesh on AVSIM:

japan1_srtm_mesh.zip
japan2_srtm_mesh.zip

you should get amazing results :)

now I thought you mentioned something about the Captain Sim 757 for FSX..they are all already out there, except for the freighters..I have the FS2004 installer with loader, and a loader for the FSX version..do you have the installer itself?"
,Mr Silver,2007-06-13T11:32Z,"Hi 4X-AXG, thanks for this up. Is it an installer pls?"
,4X-AXG,2007-06-13T17:28Z,click on the '3' where it says 'Files:' ;-)
,Mr Silver,2007-06-13T19:28Z,"Yeah, apologies 4x, senior moment (get a lot of those lately!). Thanks again."
,The_Hangar_18,2007-06-14T18:32Z,"4x, yes i have the 767-300 installer for fs9, but no loader."
,4X-AXG,2007-06-19T19:59Z,"do you mean the 757-300? they are already out there..only model missing is the 757 freighter for FSX..if you have that one, you're a hero"
