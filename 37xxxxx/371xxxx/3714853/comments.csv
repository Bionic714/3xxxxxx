Seeder, be responsible! You got a lot of people who need this Padi stuff. So SEED it! Stop fucking around! "
,Diverinblack,2007-06-25T09:03Z,I'm seeding from 9am UK Time till midnight every day with a 50k upload rate so you should have recieved it by now. But if it's so important you need it in a rush go and buy it
,andkhl,2007-06-26T18:36Z,"Rush??? Nooo! How dare I? No fricking rush! 
Today is June 26. You uploaded the torrent June 15. According to the statistics, your torrent has been downloaded ZERO times during these 11 days!!! What do you call this? ""Rush""??? Are you seeding a 50GB file, or just just under 5GB...

Also, don't tell me what to do, because it is not me to blame for your incapability of seeding for whatever reason!!! 

Hey, thank you anyway, for seeding."
,andkhl,2007-06-27T06:58Z,"Hey, on the second thought.... Keep doing what you doing! Thanks for sharing! One thing though: next time, please opt for a faster connection if you can, or seek somebody's help in seeding your files."
,Trivial10,2007-07-10T10:27Z,"Great uploads. Can you please put up the macintosh versions as well. It is the .dmg files on your cd or dvd. 

If you have more PADI stuff. This would meen a lot. Thanks again. 

Thank you"

Okay, so, it was in 'padding files' that accompany the actual DVD so I think you'd be able to download it just make sure you do not download the padding files when you do.  Norton Antivirus didn't catch this...neither did Spybot.  It was ""CounterSpy"" that finally found this little bug.  

Good luck, anyway."
