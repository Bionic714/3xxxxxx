,Hajime,2007-06-18T22:27Z,"Maybe for extras, IÂ´m not sure. I havenÂ´t watch this movie, but is supossed to be a mute documentary."
,Beaverlicker,2007-06-19T17:27Z,The original DVD has a few extras with interviews by Godfrey Reggio and Phillip Glass!
,titestef,2007-07-25T21:11Z,SUPERB!  A TRULY HIPNOTIC MASTERPIECE!!!

That's a dumb rhetorical question!

How about these...
1. You're deaf and you can't enjoy any movie in your own language unless it comes with what?

2. The audio is in English but you can't speak that language because you're french.

3. You want to see the movie but your only chance is before going to bed and your beloved one is already asleep. You can't turn the volume up but you still want to catch the actors whisperings.

Do you need more?

Hajime,
You're great!
Many thanks."
,tetra3,2008-05-04T20:10Z,"Dear Muzikphan, your would have been correct, BUT:
There is no single word spoken in this movie. Got it?"
,sutter_cane_66,2009-01-31T14:17Z,"...so the original language is none. :)

Thanks!"
