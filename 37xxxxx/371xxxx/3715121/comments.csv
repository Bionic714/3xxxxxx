But please, maybe somebody knows hot to repair the out of sync problem."
,bennyoneil,2008-05-19T22:13Z,"the best way to sort the sound and sync out is to sit closer to your pc,put your ear against the monitor,put usb up your arse and hey presto!might not work but at least you look like you're trying....:)"
,nenea_hartia,2008-06-23T20:04Z,"Thank you, bennyoneil, great answer for such a great guy. Or maybe it was your arse answering?"
,runcdfirst,2009-07-03T01:28Z,"Regarding the audio sync problems.. An adjustment of -3900ms seems to be fairly ok on the last 30 minutes. If you use mediaplayer classic you can find that in Options -> Internal Filters -> Audio Switcher -> Audio time shift

Anyhow, very nice documentary! Thx a lot to all the seeders and the original uploader"
,Klou,2009-10-25T12:29Z,Try this link instead http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3948826/Crossing_the_Line. No sync problems on that one. Thanks for posting anyhow!
,cymen,2012-01-08T16:55Z,i second it. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3948826/Crossing_the_Line is the correct link
,cin.swirl,2012-01-09T06:05Z,Easy fix for VLC users at that point in the film where the sound gets massively delayed is to press J and go up to -4250m/s.
