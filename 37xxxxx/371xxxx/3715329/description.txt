Every Wednesday at noon, the women who were forcibly taken by the Japanese government during World War 2 to serve as sex slaves for the Japanese army, and their supporters, gather to demand that the Japanese government issue a formal apology to the affected women and give them just compensation. These brave women who are in their golden years, have broken their silence, which they had kept thus far from a sense of shame, and are one by one coming forth with their stories.
Six women who were victimized during the atrocities are living in a house they call ?Nanum,? in Seoul. They aren?t bothered by the scorching summer heat or the freezing winters as they learn to read and write and paint. They are struggling to overcome the scars that have not healed in all the years that have passed.
