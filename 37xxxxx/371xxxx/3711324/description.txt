:. About .:

Starshatter extends the gameplay concepts of the classic sims 
by combining fighter and starship combat in a single game. 

Starshatter: The Gathering Storm, the "follow-up" to 2004's 
ambitious space combat sim. 
Starshatter remains something of an interesting throwback to
a time when space-combat sims like Wing Commander and X-Wing
were the first-person shooters of their day. But to its credit, Starshatter
does a lot more than simply mimic famed predecessors. In many ways,
Starshatter feels like a cross between Wing Commander and Falcon 4.0, 
combining the fast-paced action of the former with the depth of the latter
to create a dynamic space combat game.
