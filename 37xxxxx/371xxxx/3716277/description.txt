The HARLEM SESSIONS boasts some truly cinematic recordings from the 70?s Blaxploitation era, a time when Soul and Jazz artists embraced Funk as the main vehicle for their songs. The former leader of The Impressions, Curtis Mayfield sets the tone weighing in heavily whilst Gil Scott-Heron, Herbie Hancock, Pucho, Ester Phillips and William DeVaughn all match him pound for pound on the musical scales.
