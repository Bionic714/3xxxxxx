,Bandito77,2007-06-21T19:12Z,"Most of the Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer rips are not up to par... main problem was the sound was delayed by 2-3 seconds and the screen was fuzzy. This one is not... the sound is fixed and seems to be better quality than the other two that i downloaded
Quality - 7/10"
