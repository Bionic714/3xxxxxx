Hardsub Keroro 92.

It is subbed on a chinese episode of keroro 92, the english subtitles are slightly above the chinese ones. This is an UNOFFICIAL subbing of Keroro Gunsou 92. Wait for the one that [Keroro] Fansubs comes out with. I only did this because I was bored and there wasn't going to be any keroro until after the 13th of June. Please excuse the typos and bad timing. Note: Not all of the lines are timed according to the chinese subtitles, this was done on purpose as I released .ssa .ass files as well.

Credit for the chinese subtitles go to that fansub group (I'm not sure which it is, the file I had originally was not labeled with a fansub group name)

Happy Viewing~
