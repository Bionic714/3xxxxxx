Description
Album number six from the Detroit based garage rock duo is the follow up to 2005's Grammy Award winning 'Get Behind Me Satan.' Produced by Jack White himself and recorded over a period of three weeks in Nashville, 'Icky Thump' signals a welcome return to the band's trademark blues rock sound, yet with a few surprises thrown in. Flamenco rhythms, bagpipes and trumpets are just some of the unexpected elements that make an appearance over the course of the album, giving the band a new dimension whilst retaining their raw playing style and unquestionable songwriting skill. Includes the single 'Icky Thump.'
