Gale Riplinger's exhaustive six-year collation of new Bible versions, their underlying Greek manuscripts, editions, and editors is culminated by this video. It objectively and methodically documents the hidden alliance between new versions and the New Age Movement's One World Religion. The emerging new Christianity - with its substitution of riches for righteousness, a crown for a cross, and an imitation for a new creation - is shown to be a direct result of the wording in new versions. Gale exposes new version editors - in agreement with Luciferians, occultists, and New Age philosophy - in mental institutions, s√©ance parlors, prison cells, court rooms for heresy trials, and most shocking of all - denying that salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ. 2-1/2 hrs.
