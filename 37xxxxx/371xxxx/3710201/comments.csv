,zeshin,2009-03-07T23:40Z,Why the hell do you rar mp3s??!
,Axolotlkips,2009-04-19T03:27Z,"For one, it lets people pick just the albums they want to download (although folders would be a better solution).

Also, it prevents people from DL'ing only one song, which makes them useless as a seed. This isn't Lime/Frostwire, and people shouldn't use it as such.

But you're right, having to unrar the music was kind of an annoying extra step."
,sminmorph,2009-05-13T05:26Z,anyone know a mac app to open .RAR files?
