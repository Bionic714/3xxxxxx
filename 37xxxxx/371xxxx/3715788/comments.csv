,earjam818,2007-06-17T11:54Z,"I'm sure if the person watching this doesn't mind seeing people killed, they wouldn't mind seeing animals killed.  I remember renting this as an elementary (wtf?!?) school kid, don't really think I could stomach it now.  Thanks anyways."
,fasterthanhell,2007-06-17T12:50Z,a movie for psychopaths i guess¨'
,Ghostis,2007-06-24T09:03Z,Hope you seed it to the end soon!
,Redbuhl,2007-06-26T13:19Z,"Please read the description carefully!

This is a version of the original Faces of Death without cruelty. This means _all_ the cruel scenes of people and animals has been stripped (removed)

You should watch the original one! It's a classic cult movie! (:"
,mpasdos,2007-07-03T06:54Z,even if this was the original version it's not about being a psychopath. death is a natural and normal fascination for any humans. not just death but war and mutilation as well. it may be very frightening for a lot of people but that's totally normal. but why bother saying this? you're all obviously too stupid to understand if you're gonna say a cruelty free movie is for psychopaths.
,mpasdos,2007-07-03T06:55Z,"well, not all of you."
,Critic,2007-07-26T20:26Z,"I love Faces of Death and you just raped the fuck out of DEATH !!! Why ??? Hi hi it's important in this life to get used to death it's the meaning of life; TO DIE !!! Don't see this movie just look at the real thing. And see the beathy of DEATH.. 
Enjoy, ;)"
,Critic,2007-07-26T20:36Z,"I saw a kurd suicide clip just to let the people see how determent they are.. And I must say it was funny as hell, this guy jumped very elegantly from a montainclif a nice jump first I was thinking he jumped down to dive in the ocean but no this guy jumped face down on the ground just on the rocks... And then there was a real ""jury"" who gave him a rating for his jump !!!
HaHa Death is just another part of life people.... Enjoy your life and embrace death ;)"
,monstergrizen,2007-11-29T00:17Z,"Well... Stop crying and don´t dowload this, if you can´t deal with death!"
,Wopatoolie,2008-05-16T06:45Z,now what in the world is faces of death 'cruelty free' edition....the credits? ha
,prasnto,2009-07-28T22:13Z,"So to get this straight: what you've basically done is censored the original video, then added some totally superfluous filter effects so that you could pass this off under the benevolent guise of a 'fan edit' instead of a 'censored and redacted to fuck' edit. Nice, well played (not really). "
