Faces of Death: Cruelty Free Edition 

This is a fan edit of "Faces of Death". Gone is the horrible footage of animals being tortured and killed. Gone is the cheesy end credits and bad music! Experience "Faces of Death" on a whole new terrifying level! 

ORIGINAL RUN TIME: 105 MINUTES 
NEW RUN TIME: 63 MINUTES 

(This is a requested release of a film I did over a year ago. I was still VERY inexperienced and was using amateur software to do all of the editing. It's never been released previously...so enjoy!!!) 

About this edit: 

-Added Red Tone to Opening w/autopsies, Electrocution and dead bodies floating in water. 
-Added Sepia Tone to footage during Dr. Gross's story about death. 
-Added Threshold and film speed up to a couple scenes (I won't spoil which!) 
-Added mild dust and film grain to entire film, giving it a worn, battered look. 
-Added additional "old age" film grain to the scene with the assassin interview. 

-Deleted ALL animal footage except the faux news footage of an alligator, and a vet clinic tryingto revive a dog. 
-All other torture and death of animals has been removed. 
-Deleted end credits (corny music and a cheesy recap of scenes from before intercut with "birth", bleh!)

*DVD Includes an opening trailer for another unreleased edit I did for "Silent Night, Deadly Night 2" and an interactive menu which includes options to view the film and a trailer for the "FOD" edit.
