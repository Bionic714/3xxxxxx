,nonanonuser,2007-12-06T21:14Z,"all are instrumental versions, unbearable even for an elevator ride"
,RelaxedAtmosphere,2008-02-08T11:08Z,"hey genius.. these are KARAOKE files.. that's what the weird file is with it called ""CDG"" it's an acronym for ""Compact Disc with Graphics"". if you have a compatible player (there are hundreds on the internet) you can play the CDG file and it will play the music with lyrics on screen so YOU can sing them. 

Great Upload JDCROONER!! awesome songs!! Thanks for your time!! i plan to seed for a very long time."
