Familiar with period-piece costume comedy from his stint as Baldrick in Blackadder Tony Robinson took centre-stage here as the writer and one of the stars of this deservedly popular children's sitcom, which put a feminist spin on the Robin Hood legend. In Tony Robinson's show, Hood is an ineffectual wimp, whereas the formidable idealist Marian is the true leader of the resistance against the evil monarch King John. Marian terrorises the forest-dwelling peasants into following her commands as she plots to rob from the rich to feed the poor. But, courageous and capable though she is, her plans rarely turn out as she envisages, being derailed either by her naive idealism or the sheer incompetence of the mentally challenged nincompoops who comprise her Merry Men, including Rabies, Barrington (a Rastafarian) and the appropriately diminutive Little Ron.
