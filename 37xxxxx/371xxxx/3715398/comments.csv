,skrasis,2007-07-07T03:54Z,"The video and audio are both skipping, does it on multiple players, I have C2D with gig of memory so I do not think its my comp.  The link for the codec does not work has anyone else had this problem?"
,bagwani,2007-07-15T00:31Z,"Have the same problem as skrakis skipping, colors drifting and audio video out of sync. The same is also true for me with ""The curse of the Black Pearl"" 1080 of HDTV China. "
,hurrafor,2007-07-19T16:28Z,"ABSOLUTELY works....you just have to do a little digging:

First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.


Install those and report back!
