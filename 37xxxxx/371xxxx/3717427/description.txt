Remastered By Knobo, Recorded off dutch TV Program VARA Laat in 2004. I always found that the original sounded a bit dull and muted and i was lucky to record this live performance and remastered it to my own liking. The Aim of the Remaster was to simulate the recording enviroment acoustics from stereo.
Original Lossless Format.
