dont bother fake!!! password shit

How the hell do you password a .avi file? Just wondering, sure the ending .avi could be changed from some other format, but how come there is 221 seeders?

Anyways, mVs has proven to have the best quality TS' the lasting atleast 3-4 weeks imo. Same thing here, beats their ""opponent"" cam'ers by far..."
[T],strangolof,2007-06-19T18:49Z,"What the fuck's upp with you kniccas? There's no god damn password and what's with this punk moaning about ""CRC error""?! Nigga, if your file ends up corrupted the error is on your fucking end!"

And they all state that ""this is the real deal""..

Please, if you're a moron in handling a camera, tell us!
Who cares if the cam is bad; we just want to know before we waste our lifes downloading shit!!!"
,dj_kox,2007-06-26T14:07Z,"no password, ok cam hold, littel delay in sound
missing start and end text, but have the movie "
,The BLAIDD,2007-07-05T17:55Z,"Video quality is pretty good, as well as the audio.
about 15% of the lower edge is cut off due to bad positioning of the cam. To cheap to get one yourself, grab this one.

Thx mVs"
