Stanley Kubricks last film from 1999 has all the hallmarks of a Kubrick movie.
The icey cold feeling in the pictures and the slow, tensed dialogue.
The dialogue in this movie seems to be on the edge all the time.
For a Kubrick fan you can see in the camera work after just a few seconds that it is a Kubrick movie.
His wide-angle lens is a distinguished feature in all his films and contributes to the feeling of being an unwelcome observer, like you're seeing something you're not supposed to see, and it gives the pictures a "cold" feeling.
I've read that Kubrick himself concidered the movie to be a fiasco, but I certainly do not agree! This is in deed an odd thriller.
A peculiar detail is the christmas lights that are spread throughout the movie!
There are these colourful lights in almost half of the scenes, and I enjoyed trying to spot them. ;-)    /Georrge
