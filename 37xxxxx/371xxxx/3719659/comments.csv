,Mick Jagger,2007-06-21T02:29Z,Does this version have the full unedited sex scenes? Or is it the standard censored version?
,georrge,2007-06-21T03:04Z,"I don't know.
I didn't know there were differrent versions."
,Mick Jagger,2007-06-21T13:15Z,"Yeah, the original version, was digitally 'enhanced'. They added cloaked hooded figures to hide some of the sex scenes. Later I heard they released an un-cut version on DVD in Europe only. The un-cut version has never been released in the US. I'd love to see it."
