Release Notes: At long last they are back! Three years after their critically acclaimed "Thunderdome" album, Germany based hard rock heroes Pink Crean 69 deliver this eagerly awaited longplayer. For a number of reasons "In10sity" is a special album in the band's history. On the one hand it marks the band's debut for their new label, Frontiers Records. On the other it is the band's tenth regular studio effort and celebrates its 20th anniversary.

Enjoy!
