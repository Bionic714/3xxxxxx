[V],Subzero!,2007-06-17T14:23Z,"spadagoal_93

use another virustool, or try this rename any .txt file to .exe file and zack, your virustool claims to founded a virus, weird dont you think?.... 
btw: all my uploads are checked before i upload!..."
,spadagoal_93,2007-06-18T01:37Z,ok man i believe you cos ive downloaded other torrent by you and they've worked great :)
[V],Subzero!,2007-06-18T02:22Z,"yeah and i wouldnt make joke about this, just can only remember all the way long that i test for this stuff like viruses or trojon, with different tools, and when spybot search n destroy doesnt find anything , then tnere wont be anything!, thanks for reading and trusting, you have fun!.... enjoy the game!"
,spadagoal_93,2007-06-18T02:41Z,thx man i trust you and i did install the game and it works perfectly!!! You are a God!!! i am seeding now so others can download. 
[V],Subzero!,2007-06-18T02:57Z,"CoooooooooooL, that makes me as much as happy as you might be!, thanks for seeding!, seeds are always needed, could upload 3 times as much as now, but its like from 1000 leechers, are just a handful start to seed after!, there should be more like you!"
,mafiosogiacomo,2007-06-18T22:39Z,"Thanks Subzero! for the good upload.  You say that it includes music, but what happened to the radio stations!?!?  Are they included and I screwed something up??  Somebody let me know if they got the radio stations to work please =)"
,beierholm,2007-06-25T17:22Z,"When i try to open ""Install-Game.exe"" it says:
""Windows cannot acces the specified device, path of file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item"".
I doesn't help to try and open any of the other installation files or the ""Doesn't work try this"".
Does anyone have a suggest on what to do?"
[V],Subzero!,2007-06-28T00:50Z,"/Grand Theft Auto 3.rar can be used to unrar, install.exe normally aswell, it just makes it easier to extracting, choosing folder etc, double click one the 
/Grand Theft Auto 3.rar file and drag and drop folder to any place you wish , and then follow the simple install description above...."
,beierholm,2007-06-28T18:49Z,"Thanks for the help Subzero!
I can't change the resolution and as already mentioned the radio stations aren't working.
Otherwise it goes absolutely perfect, GREAT upload :)"

,Frozone,2007-07-30T17:51Z,"Ok, Subzero i didnt know what you did with the file, but im pissed off !!.

I did Exactly what you wrote, and played the game.
Then i closed it down properly and my screen was in resolution 800*600 and into 4 color bit !!
I couldn't change 

I don't know why it changed but i needed 2 reboot  
my pc, (back-upped everything). Cause the drivers both from cd and ASUS didn't work

I know my grammatical isn't  good, that cause im 13.

I would like 2 know how this happened cause your other torrents are the best.

,advil0,2007-10-03T06:42Z,"AVG found a trojan in a few .exe files, be careful."
,Mulleboy,2007-10-10T01:17Z,"Reason for radio not working:

IT IS RIPPED. Obviuosly the uploader lied in his brief description of this ancient great game.

It's nowhere near as fun if you don't have the radio :D Fuck you Subzero! for tricking me into downloadin' this :P"
,m7F4Y3,2007-10-13T01:38Z,"Thanks so much!! For the upload! I figured out a way to get music into the game! :) There are: CHAT.wav, HEAD.wav, MSX.wav and RISE.wav(in the folder called audio) those are only 3 seconds long and thats what the game is using, so you don't hear anything. Get an mp3 and convert it into .wav format and call it HEAD.wav or the other ones listed, replace the original and hear music in the game! :)"
,thegameisup208,2007-11-07T10:39Z,"Hi subzero, 
 Ive got a problem i hope you can help with. i try to install as previously mentioned and followed all the albeit simple steps but when i run the install it tells me it can't find the archive and that protection.exe isn't recognised as external or internal command, operable program or batch file...press any key..i do and it tells me it needs at least 16mb of video memory which is stupid...can you help please? thanks"
