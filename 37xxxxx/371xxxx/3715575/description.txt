This is volume two of Darkarbiter's mixes. 
This volume contains my mixes that have appeared on Example FM first. Previous volumes I have assumed outdated and will not appear on there. I hope you enjoy my mixes! For more info and FTP links for my mixes goto www.last.fm/user/darkarbiter and check my journal for info about me, my mixing and filefront links. 

This Is Psytrance at its best. I try to make dynamic mixes going from fast to trippy to melodic psy. I hope you guys enjoy this and I usually make a mix about once a week. When I have accumulated 3-5 mixes I will release a new torrent with the new ones in it. Enjoy!



With Overshadowed I tried to combine a lot of different elements of Psy while still maintaining an overall flow. I don't think my mixing is too great in this set and I've decided that in the future it's best not to have voice in the middle of sets (unless I find a good way to do it such as talking over)

Forever goa was actually made first out of these mixes. However I decided to extend it after Zebra into a full 2 hour piece. This mix is all about melody and emotion. If anyone wants me to upload any of the mixes into 2 (1 79 minute  and another the rest of the piece) files for burning onto cd just drop me a comment on my last fm page.
