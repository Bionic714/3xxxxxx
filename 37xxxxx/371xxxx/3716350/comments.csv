ConvertXToDVD is the most efficient program I've found, and I think I've tried them all.  Interface is very easy to figure out, the options are simple to configure, and it does a lot of the work for you.  "

You're most likely using a video player that doesn't support avi files. I would recommend DivX Player."

,chewythedog,2010-01-15T21:32Z,WTF?  How can it be a DVDrip if the A/V aren't both 10?  Is this the oldest cam copy out there or something?
,co2vsh2o,2010-02-17T23:44Z,thx i never watch it!
,DrDrizzy,2010-03-21T20:06Z,"CAM CAM CAM CAM CAM CAM CAM CAM CAM!!!

HORRIBLE!!!"
[V],phatwarez,2010-05-06T11:39Z,"The quality is fine it's just an old style rip. Probably was ripped 10 years ago. Video codec is divx5, which isn't as good as modern ffdshow/h264/xvid etc...

If you want quality download the blueray rip. If you want a movie downloaded in three minutes flat, get this one."
,Elgiard,2010-12-30T00:25Z,"I wish this would work.  It won't play in anything for me, including VLC.  Is there some weird codec I need or something?"
,lashedcrayon,2011-01-27T12:38Z,"this movie is great. seen it long ago. this movie is a have to.
v/10
a/10"
,pschlosser,2011-03-30T08:37Z,"The video quality is pretty poor, on this one.  It should come as no surprise, though.  This is 2.5 hours compressed to fit onto one 700MB CD."
,Topazskillmauler,2011-05-15T06:35Z,WTF are you retards talking about. It is not cam!

,503Alex,2011-06-15T09:55Z,"I don’t need you to tell me how fucking good my coffee is, okay? I’m the one who buys it. I know how good it is. When Bonnie goes shopping she buys SHIT. Me, I buy the gourmet expensive stuff because when I drink it I want to taste it. But you know what’s on my mind right now? It AIN’T the coffee in my kitchen, it’s the dead nigger in my garage."
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-07-03T07:40Z,"This is not a Cam!

V: 10
A: 10
M: 10

Weather it be an old rip or not it still hits the 10's across the board for me.
