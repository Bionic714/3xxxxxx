,lirio,2011-03-17T05:40Z,"appreciate the effort, but this is the 2005 version, not the 1984."
,laned130,2011-06-02T18:46Z,"My understanding is that there are 3 versions:
1984 original - Japanese only
1985 international version - English - cut by 25 mins - called ""Warriors of the Wind"" in the USA
2005 uncut version with new English voices added

I think this is 2005 release. Can anyone confirm/clarify this?"
