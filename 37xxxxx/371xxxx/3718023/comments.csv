,DrBraun,2007-06-19T22:32Z,I hope this isn't a fake like the others I've downloaded...
,PhantomW,2007-06-19T22:55Z,"Thank you, kind sir! :)"
,KazanKazani,2007-06-20T04:24Z,transcode. remove.
,doublebumfun,2007-06-20T05:23Z,"Hey KazanKazani, you're a fucking asshole you know that? Just be grateful that you get to listen to the album this early. It sounds perfectly find so take your audiophile bullshit and shove it up your ass. Fucking warez kiddies, expecting every single mp3 to be a 10gb file. Back in my day we were grateful to just be able to get one mp3 off of napster a night on a 56k modem. Fuck you."
,KazanKazani,2007-06-20T06:07Z,"I'm sorry, I don't know if I can respond seriously.  Maybe later."
,doublebumfun,2007-06-20T06:28Z,More like you don't have time to because your mom just told you that you have to goto bed now. lol.
,KazanKazani,2007-06-20T06:39Z,"wow I guess your right, that would explain me commenting now I guess.  Man, I can't wait to grow  up and be 70."
,KazanKazani,2007-06-20T06:40Z,"Even though I was being blunt in my post, your response was a bit over-reactive, especially considering how many dupes/fakes/transcodes of this album there is out there."
,padenj69420,2007-06-20T12:23Z,"THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!

GREAT QUALITY!!!!

I've been keeping my eyes peeled for this one.

YOU KICK SO MUCH ASS!!!!"
,KazanKazani,2007-06-20T13:19Z,"by the way, for those who are interested, a perfect 320 copy complete with scans & !MrQuestion.html file confirming it's real, which was generously supplied by me to a friend, is over at OiNK.  "
,patiesmiz,2007-06-20T14:38Z,"So go to fucking OINK to get the stuff and stop posting on here for a while, plz, just do it.
Btw, how many transcodes of this stuff have been upped to OINK and deleted?
You sure that 320 ripping is not another one?
I'm sure this torrent on Thepiratebay is good stuff, dunno wtf is happening with this album, I got it from Demonoid 3 days ago at 192, perfect stuff (was checking it out with nfo.Builder and EncSpot, and listening to it on Foobar, and it was perfect), but, for some weird reason, it has been removed from the tracker.
(And I got just curious and got the transcode one as rar file to compare)
Sorry for my English.

Tnx, doublebumfun, for sharing on a public tracker like Thepiratebay instead of posting it on fucking fascist-elitist OINK."
,KazanKazani,2007-06-20T14:40Z,my jesus can jump higher.
,patiesmiz,2007-06-20T14:43Z,It's always same story: those who are always complaining are those who never share.
,nasarius,2007-06-20T18:51Z,"He may be an asshole, but he's right. The quality is garbage. This is definitely not a 192 CBR rip from a CD."
,nasarius,2007-06-20T18:58Z,"BTW, if you need an example, try listening to ""Murder"". I confess to having pretty nice headphones (Sony MDR-7506, driven by an Audigy 4), but that track should sound awful to everyone."
,patiesmiz,2007-06-20T20:03Z,"Yes, all what I got were transcodes, cheched them out, except this one, which just got from STMusic, the secene one, checked it out:

Description	ARTIST: Bad Religion

GENRE: Punk Rock
BITRATE: 236kbps avg

Tis is the good one."
,JAGFin1,2007-06-21T17:44Z,"I'd personally say the copy is very good quality. Excellent for something so early on. Well done. Also, mentioning OiNK, if anyone has a free invite, i'd be very grateful."
