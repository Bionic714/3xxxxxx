:. About .:

The voracious Tasmanian Devil (or \\\"Taz\\\" for short), who\\\'s famous for his loud,
incoherent gibbering, his ability to turn into a hyperactive brown whirlwind,and
his love of eating pretty much anything, has been a member of Warner Bros.\\\' 
classic Looney Tunes cartoon cast for years. So it would make sense for him to 
eventually become the star of his own game. And Taz Wanted gets off to a good 
start.

The game features colorful,cartoon-style, flat-shaded graphics,a decent 
soundtrack,and voice acting ripped straight from the cartoons.
