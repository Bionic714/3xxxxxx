:. about .:

COLOBOT combines both a real time strategy game and an
initiation to programming. You are at the head of a space
expedition and you are only assisted by a few robots. Your
mission consists in successive attempts at the exploration
and colonization of various planets.

You will have to search raw materials and energy needed to
survive. As you progress, you will be able to build and
program new types of robots which will prove of an invaluable
help for the completion of your task. You may also want to
know that most of the planets you'll be visiting are crowded
with primitive and insect-like life-forms and that you may be
forced into fighting them if you want to stay alive.

..::> Dino and Aliens  3D (.direct.play.) <::..



:. about .:
 
In the country where Dino lived, the sun was shining all year round and 
pineapples grew so big and delicious that you could eat too much and burst
for want of habit. But such thing never happened; everybody lived happily 
and was never sick.

But once upon a time a flying saucer hid the sun. It landed rather obtrusively right
in the middle of the garden where Dino grew his fruits. Aliens started climbing out
of it, and there were many, so it was not clear how they could all have found room 
in the saucer. They did not look very awful from the first sight, but turned to be real 
rogues. They broke trees, trampled down the grass, shoot their pistols and laughed 
disgustingly. They also put laser plants and barrels with explosives everywhere, 
planning to explode everything and build here own colony on the ruins.

Dino was a cheerful dinosaur. He could make some magic. He could slow down the 
time and become invisible. Before he only used his magic for peaceful purposes. 
But seeing aliens' disgraceful behavior he had to get angry. And here started a battle, 
the battle which became a legend. And long time afterwards dino-mamas told this
storyto their dino-babies before going to bed, and dino-babies blinked and stayed 
awake.

The beginning of this glorious battle coincides with the beginning of our game.

Remember that the story we told you is based on the true facts and that the legend 
says that all ended well.
