,kajf9491,2008-03-06T01:02Z,Hey how do you get the green audio information out of the left hand corner of the screen?
,SentrySapper,2008-05-02T01:56Z,"acidgawd99, dvds hold over 4gb, how could something 1.5gb be too large."
,Candide78,2008-05-19T19:12Z,Hi. Why are there several different file sizes for this movie? Is the movie resolution better for the 1.47GB compared to the more common 700MB file size?
,nikromatt,2008-09-01T18:55Z,"Thanks for torrent! This one has everything from original poster to the soundtrack. A PDF UK version of the book which contains the full 21 chapters. The the US published version doesn't.

The video is also perfect in quality."
[T],insinuendo,2009-05-04T02:23Z,"A beautiful torrent! Perfect for anyone who is a fan of the Kubrick masterpiece! 

Video quality is perfect.
