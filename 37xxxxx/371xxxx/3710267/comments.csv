You asked for comments. Well, how about these?

Blanche - If We Can't Trust The Doctors
Dizzy Rascal - Showtime
Interpol - Antics
Willy Mason - Where The Humans Eat
Hanin Elias - Future Noir
Ron Sexsmith - Retriever
The Futureheads - The Futureheads
The Get Up Kids - The Guiltshow
Moving Units - Dangerous Dreams
Social Distortion - Sex, Love and Rock 'n Roll
Jim White - Drill A Hole In That Substrate And Tell Me What You See

Interpol + Futureheads + Jim White + Ron Sexsmith should not be missed especially.
But please understand that I really really really LOVE your work and have nothing but respect for the knowledge and time that you put into these lists.
But you DID ask for comments......
Very Best Regards,
Bluegamba"
[T],Shanklys Love Child,2007-08-02T15:23Z,"Thanks for the feedback Bluegamba - much appreciated.  I should have had some Willy Mason and I have just recently discovered Jim White (via Nina Nastasia) and dig his stuff. 

Wasn't as keen on Ron Sexsmith, but like some of the Futureheads stuff. 'Carnival Kids' will feature on my best of 2003 compilation should I ever get round to doing it - remember when I first heard it as a Peel session track and thought it was great. 

Will check out some of the other stuff you recommended that I haven't heard before. So thanks :)"
