---
As a young child, Lee Lung (Dragon Lee) watched as his parents were viciously murdered at the hands of the bandit lord Sek-King.  To make matters worse, Sek-King kidnapped Lee?s sister and brought her up as his own.  With his family gone, Lee was raised and trained in martial arts under the supervision of a drunken master.

Years later, after Lee has finally mastered his skills, he sets off to take vengeance for the loss of his family.  Accompanied by Siu-Ching, a neighbor girl who has fallen in love with him, Lee scours the countryside in pursuit of the bandits, destroying them one by one, and paving the way for the inevitable showdown with Sek-King.
