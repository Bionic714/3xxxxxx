1)   Hugh Grant - Pop! Goes My Heart Lyrics

I never thought that I could be so satisfied
Every time that I look in your angel eyes
A shock inside me that words just can t describe
And there s no explaining

Something in the way you move I can t deny
Every word from your lips is a lullaby
A twist of fate makes life worthwhile
You are gold and silver

I said I wasn t gonna lose my head
But then pop! Goes my heart
(Pop! Goes my heart)
I wasn t gonna fall in love again
But then pop! Goes my heart
(Pop! Goes my heart)
And I just can t let you go
I can t lose this feeling

These precious moments we have so few
Let s go far away where there s nothing to do but wait
You show to me that my destiny s with you
And there s no explaining

Let s fly so high
Will you come with me tonight?
In your dress I confess you re the sole sunlight
The way you shine in the starry skies
You are gold and silver

I said I wasn t gonna lose my head
But then pop! Goes my heart
(Pop! Goes my heart)
I wasn t gonna fall in love again
But then pop! Goes my heart
(Pop! Goes my heart)
And I just can t let you go
I can t lose this feeling

A twist of fate makes life worthwhile
You are gold and silver

I said I wasn t gonna lose my head
But then pop! Goes my heart
(Pop! Goes my heart)
I wasn t gonna fall in love again
But then pop! Goes my heart
(Pop! Goes my heart)

I said I wasn t gonna lose my head
But then pop! Goes my heart
(Pop! Goes my heart)
I wasn t gonna fall in love again
But then pop! Goes my heart
(Pop! Goes my heart)
And I just can t let you go

2)  Haley Bennett - Buddha's Delight Lyrics

I'm starting to believe, boy
That this was meant to be, boy
Cause I believe in karma
Boy, do you believe in karma?

So forget about your past life
Cause this could be our last life
We're gonna reach nirvana
Boy, we're gonna be reach nirvana

Chorus

Each time you put your lips to mine
Its like a taste of Buddha's delight
I see the gates of paradise
You're a taste of Buddha's delight
Tell me all your fantasies tonight
And I will make them happen
Cause I'm not satisfied if I don't get my Buddha's delight

Om Shanti Shanti(2X)

Like sitting meditation
You give me elevation
Can you take me higher?
I wonder, can you take me higher?
I want a revelation and sweet salvation
and the eternal fire
Show me the eternal fire

Chorus

I've got to have my Buddha's delight
Om Shanti Shanti
I've got to have my Buddha's delight
Om Shanti Shanti

Chorus

3)  Hugh Grant - Meaningless Kiss Lyrics

I saw you across the dancefloor
Out of the corner of my eye
I felt the connection
I don't know how, I don't know why
I shouldn't of stayed
When I saw you there with another man
But as we slipped away
I thought I heard you say
This wasn't part of the plan

CHORUS:
Just a meaningless kiss
It wasn't suppose to end up like this
Just a meaningless kiss
Ohh Ohh
Just a meaningless kiss
We knew it was wrong
But we couldn't resist
Just a meaningless kiss
Til I fell in love
With you

But you didn't want me to
Oh no

And here we are two years later
Too late to turn back now
We gotta finish what we shouldn't have started
We got to walk away somehow
But it's easier said than done
When two hearts beat as one
And three hearts are one too many
That's why we shouldn't have ever begun

CHORUS:
Just a meaningless kiss
It wasn't suppose to end up like this
Just a meaningless kiss
Oh oh
Just a meaningless kiss
We knew it was wrong but we couldn't resist
Just a meaningless kiss
Til I fell in love
With you

We can't go on like this forever
When we're not meant to be together
So leave me here on my own
From now on I guess I got to dance alone

CHORUS:
Just a meaningless kiss
It wasn't suppose to end up like this
Just a meaningless kiss
Oh oh
Just a meaningless kiss
We knew it was wrong but we couldn't resist
Just a meaningless kiss
But I'm still in love
With you

No matter what I do

7)  Hugh Grant - Dance With Me Tonight Lyrics

It s been so long
Since I ve known right from wrong
Got no job, sometimes I just sit down and sob
Wondering if anything will go right
Or will you dance with me tonight

When the sun departs
I feel a hole down in my heart
Put on some shoes
Come down here and listen to the blues
Wondering if anything will go right
Or will you dance with me tonight

I m looking at you
You re looking at me
We re the only two off the dance floor
Do you see what I see
Two broken lives working in harmony
Might make for a decent time
So get up and dance with me

I know that it seems that the grass will grow
Better on the other side of the barb wire fence
But that other side is not in sight
So I m fine with what I have now
If you ll dance with me tonight

What s the point of life
If risk is just a board game
You roll the dice
But you re just hoping that the rules change
What s the point if you can t bring yourself to say
Things you wanna say like
Dance with me tonight

Mama says I can't, Daddy says I can

9)  Hugh Grant - Don't Write Me Off Lyrics

It s never been easy for me
To find words to go along with a melody
But this time there s actually something, on my mind
So please forgive these few brief awkward lines

Since I met you, my whole life has changed
It s not just my furniture you ve rearranged
I was living in the past, but somehow you ve brought me back
And I haven t felt like this since before Frankie said relax

And while I know, based on my track record,
I might not seem like the safest bet
All I m asking you is don t write me off, just yet

For years I ve been telling myself the same old story
That I m happy to live off my so-called former glories
But you ve given me a reason to take another chance
Now I need you, despite the fact that you ve killed all my plants

And though I know, I ve already blown more chances
Than anyone should ever get
All I m asking you is don t write me off, just yet
Don t write me off just yet


10)  Hugh Grant & Drew Barrymore - Way Back Into Love Lyrics
(same as #5)



11)  Teddybears feat. Malte - Different Sound Lyrics

Said, ""Hey man, what's goin' on?""
'S about time I'm movin' on
You keep on, on, on, on and on
So you'll stay, move and sing a song

'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound

I've seen you and your friends around
Your feet never touched the ground
You can't tell in this part of town
But you're jacked up, so keep it down

'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound

?Get up movin'?, girls and boys
You know some people got no joys
So just go with your inner voice
You get down and I'll bring the noise

'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound

'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause yo"
