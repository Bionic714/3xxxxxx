,Zell77,2007-06-18T20:52Z,I have MioMap 3.2 on my C250. I have maps dated 2006.01 that works. But when I put your 2007.01 maps om my SD-card the C250 says that the maps are locked. Do you know how to get around that problem?
,Droidekas,2007-06-19T06:46Z,"On the PNA:s like the P350, replacing license.db in your MioMap-folder on your memorycard with the license.db in this release should do the trick.
It should work on the C250 too."
