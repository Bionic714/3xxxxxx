New Oldfield live is always welcome! :)
Been collecting his live performances for some time now, usually searching for higher quality but anyway it is great that you offer it in one shot :)
..regardless of your seeding speed...;)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
DVD #1 MO CONCERTS 1973-1981

Audio format is 128kbps MP3 almost all encoded  from higher quality source using LAME codec (some concerts been equalized before encoding)
(in some cases quality is 96kbps LAME because of dvd disc limit)

Video format is 400x300 XViD all encoded from higher quality source (best viewed with Windows Media Player 10/11 with full acceleration which remove compression blocks)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
...just to let others know before downloading ;)"
