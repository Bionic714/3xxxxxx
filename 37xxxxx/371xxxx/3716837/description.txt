We Jam Econo - The Story of the Minutemen, is a full-length documentary about the influential 1980's punk rock band Minutemen, created by director Tim Irwin and producer Keith Schieron in association with Rocket Fuel Films. The film premiered on Feb 25, 2005 at the historic Warner Grand Theatre in San Pedro, California, after two years in production.

Poignant recent interviews with the band's two surviving members Mike Watt and George Hurley, as well as first-person anecdotes from punk notables including Ian MacKaye, Flea, Henry Rollins and Thurston Moore, complement the archival concert and interview footage of the band, creating an informative and moving film for those interested in the band or punk rock in general.

The title comes from a comment made near the end of the film by Mike Watt, in a 1985 interview, when the band is asked if they have anything else to say. He answers for them: "We jam econo." Econo was local slang for economic and described the band's dedication to low-cost record production and touring.
