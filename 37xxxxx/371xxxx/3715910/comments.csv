,BlackBug,2007-06-17T11:02Z,"Not working in FS2004 ? Ouch, That hurts. But I am sure not for too long . . . ! ;)"
,Loc_rus,2007-06-17T11:14Z,"Thank you so much, 4X!"
,4X-AXG,2007-06-17T11:27Z,these do indeed not work in FS9 and sorry I don't have those installers..hopefully somebody else has them :)
,Cornshark,2007-06-17T12:06Z,"Thanks 4X. Hey, does anybody know what'z up with WickedFriends.org? Fuckerz ain't respondin man. I'm fuct, cuz I 4got my pwd and thier site ain't sendin out emailz liek it shudd."
,4X-AXG,2007-06-17T23:07Z,"WF went VIP only, forcing you to donate to access the downloads..guess they were inspired by WoS"
,Cornshark,2007-06-17T23:53Z,"Awww shiza!  That blows. Well, what's the word then... any other sitez been found?  This is SK, btw - I had a problem with my other login, so i finally just ditched it.

What uuuuup?"
,4X-AXG,2007-06-18T01:22Z,"I say fuck 'em
Palestinians are not killing Israelis but eachother  and so-called pirates are forcing other pirates to pay for add-ons..it's a crazy and ironic world ;-)"
,Panodilo,2007-06-18T10:35Z,"The palestinians aren't fighting the Israelis because of the new policy of ""Don't bring your fucking problems to work"". That's why they're kicking ass around the house, so they can report fresh and focused to the frontline. "
,Cornshark,2007-06-18T20:42Z,"Whaaa  ??   You just lost me there Pandilio.
4X, I couldn't agree more. But I still wanna know where the filez are! Can you post a link directly to an FS forum on WF so I can get in there again!  Thanks."
,Cornshark,2007-06-18T20:48Z,"oops, spoke too soon there Pand... I figurd it out. lol   I still think it would be best for all involved if they all just killed each other off completely over there, thereby simply ridding the rest of us from having to deal with thier primitive, barbaric existence. It would be such a better world. But alas, ""humanity"" will always win out over logic. :-p"
,Sataris,2007-06-19T06:18Z,"WF went pay before WoS even existed, get your facts straight please"
,4X-AXG,2007-06-19T19:57Z,"well you are right on one thing..I do have to get my facts straight..WF didn't go pay/donate/VIP/FTP at all..they moved their forum around and due to circumstances I understood that they went WoS style..but they didn't, they're still free :-)"
,Panodilo,2007-06-19T21:51Z,"Today my two year old niece grabbed onto my arm and asked me with the sweetest voice you could possible imagine. She said, ""Uncle Panodilo. What the fuck is WoS?""

I didn't know. It really sucked that I couldn't explain to the child what it meant. Can somebody please educate me?"
,4X-AXG,2007-06-20T00:10Z,"hahaha LOL

WoS is a World of Sons and bitches

in fact it's a website..Wings of Silence, or something like that..well it's anything BUT silence

anyway, it's kinda comparable with WF..forum with links to rapidshare and megaupload..only they make you donate to get to their VIP section, where the goodies are shared

so, you can tell your sweet little 2 year old niece:
- never get into cars with strangers
- always look both ways at least twice before crossing a street
- and last but not least..the soon to be famous 'FFP' code: Fuck Fake Pirates!"
[T],stevekasian,2007-06-20T02:57Z,"lol - funnierd'n shit man.

Ok, I got my login back! Much thanks to TPB crew 4 that.

So 4X... can u post a link to a good FS forum on WF... or a few even, if there's more than one?? I'm locked out. They make it reeeeeelie hard for those unfamiliar with it to get in. lol
Tnx!!
SK"
[T],stevekasian,2007-06-20T03:02Z,"(i guess ""locked out"" ain't the right term 4 it... more like, ""completely befuddled""!)"

,Sutpen,2007-06-21T03:27Z,"The reason Wos has a vip section is so people can feel more comfortable sharing things they don't want shared out in the open, like recent purchases, for instance. On the whole, shares in the vip section are supposed to be brought into the general forum after 30 days. It's just like wicked, you pay for greater access and hotter merchandise and to support server costs. Unfortunately, 4X, some fuckhead with vip access is posting shares (on usenet, I believe) that people expressly wanted not to be shared out in the open - for their own reasons that should be honored. So the things you have been posting here are compromising the whole point of the vip section, which actually is to promote greater sharing, even though non vips have to wait a bit. Waiting for something is better than not waiting for nothing. Anyway, I hope you can understand the frustration of some people, partisanship aside. You already have my respect for past deeds, and I just wanted to make something clear.    "
[T],stevekasian,2007-06-21T04:30Z,"Sutpen: No offense man, but the story you tell is complete hypocracy. If people don't want shit shared, they shouldn't share shit. I mean, holy hypocracy batman... While it's complely logical to *want* to share some stuff you've got with only a few select peeps on the internet, but to get angry and resentful - to somehow feel ""wronged"" - when those shares spread like wildfire all over the internet, is about the most inane, dumbass and crybaby thing I've ever heard of in my fucking life!
Again, no offense intended to you, Sutpen... it just sounds like your speaking for people whom you'd be best served not speaking for... for ""asthetic"" reasons, if you know what I mean.
But that's just my humble opinion. :-)
I know, you weren't talking to me - I'm just butting in, as usual."
,Sutpen,2007-06-21T05:10Z,"not wronged, but frustrated. take things that way and I think you'll understand I basically agree with you. in theory, the vip process is for everyone's benefit, since the shares are eventually released, and protects the sharer. it's kind of like washing money. but if it's an experiment (for lack of a better word) that will fail utterly, then so be it. Except for this one asshole posting a few things (the coincidence between releases on the site and releases on usenet is just too great) the vip section has proved pretty successful. It wasn't my idea so my pride's not being wounded, just to let you know.  "
[T],stevekasian,2007-06-21T11:37Z,"Well, whatever. It all just sounds waaaay too complicated to me, and I just don't get it. It's like, if peeps are looking 4 a higher level of comradery, there are so many other 'real world' ways to find that. Assembling virtual piracy empires online that are built on exclusive private memberships to web based forums, and then putting so much negative energy into being frustrated when human nature takes it's course is such an exercise in futility. These peeps sound like they take their computers far too seriously. But that's just me.
And now I'm shuttin the hell up about all this, cuz I've said my piece and nobody here could give two shits what my opinion is anyway. lol"
