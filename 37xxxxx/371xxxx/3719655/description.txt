Fleetwood Mac   Mega-Music Torrent

I was just cleaning up the iTunes library and got to listening to some great Fleetwood Mac and decided to share the collection.  Yes, there are FOUR versions of "So Afraid".  Three of them are live and all show that Lindsey Buckingham is one of the greatest rock guitarists.

The songs are high quality for the most part.  Cuts from "The Chain are at 192 kbps, and most others are at 320 kbps.  The Live Studio stuff is at 160 kbps.  I believe these cuts were NOT live in the recording studio but from a live radio broadcast in a small studio.

Duplicate songs include live or alternate versions.

The torrent includes a PDF with a song list and a file with album art.

Enjoy.
