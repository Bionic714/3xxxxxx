!   D:\[PC][RiP] Europa Universalis III [tlOd]\tlod-eu3.r05: Cannot set tlod-eu3.nrg security data

Someone please give me a hint how to fix this...

Even though the conclusion might be that i'm an idiot. (I use Vista by the way)"

[T],Vilaemail,2007-08-10T19:38Z,"I got 2 questions:

1.Is this demo version?
2.Is this rar file corrupted?"
,giliath,2007-08-22T18:05Z,"Thanks for this torrent, I love this game :D

But I got a problem, the game works fine but is there a way to install patches for this game. If I want to install patch v1.3 it says ""Europa Universalis III is not installed on your computer. Please install the game before installing the update. The installation will now exit!"" 

Is there a way to get around this, or a fix?"
,giliath,2007-08-22T18:07Z,"@vilaemail
1- Nope this is the full version
2- Nope"
,brad102,2007-09-25T21:58Z,"When I tried installing the game , my AVG Resident Shield said it found ""Worm/Generic.DNA"" care to explain?"
,Piddyx,2008-03-24T08:33Z,"giliath - Download the patch from a mirror, not the program."
