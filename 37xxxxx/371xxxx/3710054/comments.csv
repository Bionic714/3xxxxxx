,4X-AXG,2007-06-10T12:29Z,"wow..FDC and German Landmarks is already 'out there' but the Katana, FSC 8.1 and AES 1.7 are awesome!! can't wait for them

I have a serial for JA Vol. 5 but since PM-ing is not possible anymore here..argh..I also have all those Captain Sim planes you're requesting, unless you mean the FSX Freighter"
,Sangeki,2007-06-10T12:37Z,"The Katana is ""out there"" too... well not completely out out but... out.

But FSC 8.1... nice!"
,Sangeki,2007-06-10T13:16Z,"You do realize that you actually have to seed this right?

Just checking..."
,4X-AXG,2007-06-10T13:20Z,really? I haven't seen the Katana X yet
,Sangeki,2007-06-10T13:24Z,"Nevermind seeder is there... thank you!

4X, yes in the VIP Lounge of WoS.
There's quite a bit there."
,Sangeki,2007-06-10T13:25Z,It's a rip though... so this installer here is something new.
,4X-AXG,2007-06-10T13:27Z,ahh yes..I'm not a VIP there
,fox2,2007-06-10T13:45Z,Thank you very much friend!!!
,ldemetriou,2007-06-10T13:59Z,WoS?
,ldemetriou,2007-06-10T13:59Z,What's WoS?
,ldemetriou,2007-06-10T13:59Z,"Thanks for the upload.
What's WoS?"
,ldemetriou,2007-06-10T14:00Z,Sorry for the 3 posts! LOL
,Dr. Frikadel,2007-06-10T14:37Z,"Thanks, "
,Sangeki,2007-06-10T14:41Z,"lol, yeah but we all know that this wonderful free system of yours doesn't work.

Right now we have two sides.
The guys who actually buy their stuff and share it and then we got the way bigger group who are only after leeching and don't give a fuck about giving anything back.

I rather share with people that I know are willing to give back.
That's really all there's to it.

And I'm amazed that people here are even still sharing when in every second post I see name calling and other shit where I can only come to the conclusion that 90% of you are either 12 years old or complete idiots.

This is really more like an animal cage then a community."
,spiders96,2007-06-10T14:42Z,"I can't seem to find German Landmarks X.  Can anyone post the link?

Hey, thanks Hangar_18 for the uploads!"
,Dr. Frikadel,2007-06-10T14:43Z,"Muzlumkillah, you're a little critter lover aren't you? What did share at all? Nothing you little parasite whiner? 

Life is quite simple, share stuff yourself and than you might take some words in your little ausl채ndische Maul. 
If you don't intend to share than please stick to what you're good at. Making Shit Of Bread!

Danke,
Dr. Frikadel"
,Blade213,2007-06-10T17:10Z,Ill seed at 50% for about 1hr to boost seeders
,Boogie73,2007-06-10T17:30Z,"Hey, thanks for this.. Been waiting around for this one. I Bought the FS9 version and was gonna be damned to pay for the FSX version. Ive no idea why some of you are arguing. After weeks of nothing, like 10 quality planes or software for FSX. Why cant we all just get along and celebrate the fact that we all just saved a bunch of money on our FS shit by switching to TPB!!..."
,Blade213,2007-06-10T17:34Z,"Oh and BTW, thanks for this. I thought the FS2004 version was awsome

1 request throught : Maddog 2.1 FSX (WORKING)"

,DakotaDC3,2007-06-10T18:34Z,"I agree with muzlumkillah, fuck that Wos shit. And fuck you guys that post the serials and stuff there and ask for people not to publish them here. Why not give it to all the flightsim community? Stupid asses."
