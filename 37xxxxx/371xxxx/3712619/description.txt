WHAT CAN I DO WITH A MALE NUDE?

Starring: John Levitt; John Brown
Writer and Director: PECK, Ron

SYNOPSIS: 

A short comedy on a troublesome twentieth century taboo, What Can I Do with a Male Nude? has a photographer run through all the possible ways of photographing his semi-naked model. Prompted in part by one of the recent pieces of repressive British legislation, the film also satirizes the neuroses of the photographer and English society.

A male model strikes poses which illustrate a photographer's voice-over monologue on the historical difficulty of picturing the male nude. The film deals with censorship and obsenity, artistry and pornography.
