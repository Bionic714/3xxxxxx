That torrent,however, has an extra .NFO file located in it. That extra .NFO file causes errors when downloading. "
,donbskeerd,2007-07-04T08:16Z,"Finished downloading this and can confirm that it is XVID @ 640x320. I also downloaded the FMP4 version at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3711348/Sicko.2007.DVDrip and while they both look fine (I didn't any serious scrutinizing), this one gets my vote because: XVID is more widely supported; this one is a higher resolution; and lastly it's cropped correctly (there are no black bars at the bottom/top like in the FMP4 version).

Can't say I understand the obsession with dicks and multi-part RAR'ing everthing, but oh well..life's not perfect."
