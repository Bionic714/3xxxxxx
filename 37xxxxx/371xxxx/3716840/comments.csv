,tavisjohn,2007-06-18T05:30Z,"I have gotten soo mutch great stuff from here, that I wanted to give something back."
,Bulen.dk,2007-06-20T06:03Z,"Sweet thanks, unfortunately playback is a bit choppy when played in MediaPlayer or MPlayer Classic, but using VLC should smooth it out :)"
,tavisjohn,2007-06-21T00:17Z,"Sorry about it being choppy, I encoded it with Dr. Divx, and set the quality to high.  It played just fine on my laptop through WinAmp, and on my XBOX through XBMC.

However great tip for those that have issues, try VLC player!"
,kPod,2007-07-04T18:29Z,Or you could always downgrade the quality a little yourself through the DivX converter. :3
,tavisjohn,2007-07-05T20:17Z,"Feel free to re-encode it yourself and post it.

My main reason for this file was for my personal collection.  However I decided to share it.  I do not see the point of converting it another time sense VLC appears to work for others."
,Sheriff2Murder,2008-01-08T16:26Z,heh... i remember playing the game for ps based on this...
,tavisjohn,2008-06-17T06:00Z,"This is a TV Rip and not a DVD Rip...

As for the fudged aspect ratio... It looks just fine to me on Windows Media Classic, and WinAmp."
,tavisjohn,2008-06-19T04:27Z,"You can also try changing the extension from .DIVX to .AVI
That has solved some playback issues on some of my computers."
,Viper251,2008-07-18T16:55Z,I was looking for this everywhere. Thanks!
,GuyPeppercorn,2009-02-23T06:18Z,"Is the dubbed version using the original voice actors from the series? And how close is it to the english from SAC, or 2nd Gig?

Thanks!"
,tavisjohn,2009-03-01T02:06Z,The voices are the same as the TV Series.
