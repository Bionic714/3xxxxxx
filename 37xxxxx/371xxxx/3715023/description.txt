Hello everybody!

Finally I got it - the last piece of our little FranceVFR-Collection...! 
Because it must be installed with a personalized serial, I ripped it for you.

And now I proudly present:

====================================================
FS2004 - FranceVFR - FlightRiviera AutogenPack (Rip)
====================================================

Well you know, what to do:

1. Install "FlightRiviera BasePack" via its Installer (not included.)
2. A folder called "FlightRivieraBP" will be created in your "Addon Scenery"-Folder, containing 11224 Files in the "Texture"-Subfolder.
3. Overwrite this folder with the one provided in this package.
4. You will be asked, if you want to overwrite ten files. Confirm it.
5. Now you should have 19.544 Files in your "Texture"-Folder.
6. No point six - that's all, folks!

Enjoy,
charonB
