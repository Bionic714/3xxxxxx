HKFlix Says:  	5 Stars

Simply our favorite Jet Li film, featuring some of the best fight choreography, acting, and cinematography we've seen. The plot is easy to follow, and this film is always a joy to watch. If you only buy one martial arts DVD in your life, this is the one it should be.

Plot:	When Chen (Li) discovers that his beloved teacher and mentor has been murdered, he swears to avenge his death! Then, with an unwavering commitment to vengeance, Chen puts everything on the line to settle the score!

Overview:	Jet Li stars in this historical Hong Kong action film, as Chen Zhen, a Chinese student in Japan in the 1920s. When his master is killed during the Japanese occupation of China, he returns to avenge his teacher's death. Back in China, he finds himself caught in the escalating racial tensions between the Chinese and the Japanese. The martial arts sequences in this 1994 film are handled more seriously than flashy acrobatics of other kung fu epics of the time and are perhaps a better showcase for Li's awe-inspiring fighting abilities. This story is inspired heavily by Bruce Lee's classic Fists of Fury (AKA The Chinese Connection).
