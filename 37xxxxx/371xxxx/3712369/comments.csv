,badmotorfinger,2009-01-04T21:15Z,"Kind of sad. This film is made by old guys, sniper wannabes.. They wouldn't pass the physical requirements. They are all to much focused on the rifles and the equipment. Why can't they just focus on guns and sharpshooting and leave out the sniper element, that's probably the only thing they are good at. This guys can't run 10 km below 45 min. If it was a serious film they would have focused on physical capabilities before they even mention the guns and how to use them."
[T],x_DontTreadOnMe_x,2009-01-04T23:56Z,I think it is already expected you be in top shape when in a battlefield environment...which is why this video only talks about the tactical/marksmanship aspect of it.
,badmotorfinger,2009-01-05T01:20Z,"Well the title is ""The Ultimate Sniper"". The film shows us a 45-50'ish old guy crawling in a fake ghillie suit who likes to play with guns. I think they should have left those parts out and focused on the equipment and marksmanship and named the film differently. Sharpshooting is interesting and even the guns and technic they use, but why do they pretend to be something they're not and never will be. They're so not cool, pathetic is a better word."
,sp000n,2009-02-15T02:47Z,"This old, sniper 'wannabe' is one of the SOG members.  He was part of RT Illinois, if I remember correctly.  Pretty much the baddest of the breed.  One can learn a tremendous amount from the book.

Too bad no one is seeding the whole video!  Stuck at 85.9% for a few days now."
,themalloc,2011-05-29T05:05Z,"@batmotofinger - John Plaster is a retired US Special Forces and SOG who has over 20 years of Sniper experience. So I wouldnt exactly call him and his associates old sniper wannabe's. If you have read his book and even paid attention to this DVD you'd know that his wealth of information and detail in this subject shows him more than a wannabe. If you knew anything about a rifle, marksmanship and fieldcraft you would understand this. This is meant to be a complimentary DVD to go with his very detailed instructional training manual and not as a complete video guide. If you want to learn something about this subject I'd suggest purchasing the book. "
