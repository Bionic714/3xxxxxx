Hey Deathmule, any idea if I can get the ""John from Cincinnati"" episode already converted to dvd? I guess I am like you where I hate to watch shows on a computer monitor. 


do you want me to make a DVD for you or are you trying to make a DVD your self? not shore what your asking. 

p.s. i also dont like watching tv shows on the monitor :)"
,lousybutler,2007-06-18T02:27Z,"No. You don't have to make a dvd...unless you want to...:-]   But I was wondering if you knew of a torrent site that specialized or at least had more tv shows already converted. Personally, I just don't understand why it's not more popular. Transcoding is a pain the ass. Your Lost series was a blessing for me, btw."

I really hope you will be as your downloads are the best around! ;-)"
