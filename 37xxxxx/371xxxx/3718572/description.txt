The red carpet is missing the last 10 minutes due to reception problems. It is missing Avril and Nickelabck arriving.

The MuchMusic Video Awards (or the MMVAs, as they are also known) are annual awards presented by the Canadian music video channel MuchMusic to honour the year's best music videos.

In their modern form, the awards ceremony is not held in a conventional theatre, but instead as a giant street party incorporating the CHUM-City Building, its parking lot and parts of Queen Street West. There are no hosts or announcers in the traditional awards-show fashion; instead, the MuchMusic VJs are an integral part of the festivities, introducing (and interviewing) the awards' presenters and winners throughout the show.

Live on stage: Avril Lavigne, Fergie, Billy Talent, Hilary Duff, Alexisonfire, Maroon5, Belly, The Used, Finger Eleven for the first ever Roof Top Performance, Nickelback, Jay Manuel, Sean Avery, George, Tara Reid, Joss Stone, Sum 41, Chris Bosh, Marianas Trench, Amber Tamblyn, Hedley, Kardinal Offishall, Sam Roberts, Emilie de Ravin, Ray Emery...
