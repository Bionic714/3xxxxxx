Brings back memories. The bare essentials of an image viewer.
I will try and keep this going."
,zardoz7026,2007-06-28T15:42Z,I agree.  I too will keep this going. Thanks.
,elruffian,2007-10-22T23:26Z,the last good version of an awesome image viewer 
,seven0fnine,2008-05-20T15:05Z,"Perfect version. All versions since are gradually able to cope with various video formats, junk features, as well as photo manipulation. If I want to perform advanced tasks, I'll just use PhotoShop for that, thank you. 

I want my ACDSee to just open pictures really fast any have a few mouse functions. This is truly the last perfect version of ACDSee. 

I will join in on the seeding of this torrent.

Thanks to Mmx64 for this."
