Put simply, Ozone makes music sound better. As a plug-in, it adds warmth, bass, sparkle and an overall desirable sound to your MP3s. Unlike other "enhancers", it does so by modeling the analog characteristics of vintage audio equipment such as tube amplifiers and valve equalizers. So instead of sounding harsh and hollow, your music sounds deep and full.

The main benefit comes from the internal signal processing in Ozone that makes your music sound great. But Ozone goes far beyond other "enhancers" by giving you the power and control to completely customize the sound.
