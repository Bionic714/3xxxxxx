,madhatter106,2007-06-15T01:30Z,"You're welcome!  I had been searching for the music from this version for ages, and had found maybe half of the tracks before I obtained a copy of the soundtrack on LP.  A friend of mine had it transferred to CD as a gift, and I figured that more fans of this music should hear it.  

I particularly like this version of ""Love Is Good For Anything That Ails You"" and the full version of ""Let's Face The Music And Dance.""

Just be sure to keep seeding, so more can appreciate this unavailable album..."

,madhatter106,2007-10-04T18:28Z,"Aljosja1, did you ever get this?  I was away from seeding for a couple of months, but am trying to get back in the groove - I will make sure that this torrent is still open whenever I'm logged on and connected...hoping it doesn't die, it would be a shame since this music and movie are so good..."
