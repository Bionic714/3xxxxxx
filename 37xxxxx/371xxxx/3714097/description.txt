Soundtrack to the Peter Greenaway movie "Prospero's Books," the avant-garde retooling of Shakespeare's "The Tempest."  The plot and themes of the story are interwoven into the catalog of books kept by deposed ruler Prospero, the play is 'composed' and recorded via the exclusive narration of Sir John Gielgud.  Visually sumptuous and dense - it's a shame there has not been a region 1 DVD release of this.

Music composed and conducted by Michael Nyman, performed by the Michael Nyman band.  Sadly, Greenaway and Nyman had a falling out after this was finished; Nyman felt that the director had altered and subdued many of his musical passages throughout.

CD is now out of print, though used copies can be obtained through second-hand vendors.
