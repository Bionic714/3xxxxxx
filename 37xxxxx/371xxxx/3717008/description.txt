So.You.Think.You.Can.Dance.S03E06.HDTV.XviD-JWo.avi
This is the Top 20 performance show from 13 Jun 2007.

As far as I know, a proper scene of this ep was never released so I decided to make my own cap/encode from HDTV source using AutoGK.  Resulting file should be higher quality than the other TiVO encode (which was undersized and low res)

This is my first time seeding my own torrent so please post any comments you may have. Hope this is up to the "scene" requirements. Thanks guys!
