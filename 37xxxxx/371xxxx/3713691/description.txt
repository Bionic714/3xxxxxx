A sample of pages from the full version of Beyond Bedroom Guitar (which has over 200 pages packed with useful guitar playing stuff)

This sample contains some learning hints and a detailed set of hand warm up routines.

Using a variety of Psychology based techniques including Neuro Linguistic Programming and Design Human Engineering, Spencer Westwood has created a book that shows you how to:-

* Fix bad playing habits
* Accelerate your learning
* Release tension
* Improve your sightreading
* Play with finesse, fluidity and emotion like never before

According to the website, he\'s taken stuff from the work of Richard Bandler, Win Wenger, Tony Robbins, Timothy Galway and Joseph O\'Conner - stripped away all the self-help tricks and applied them to guitar playing and musicianship.

IMHO A cool book that every guitarist should read.
