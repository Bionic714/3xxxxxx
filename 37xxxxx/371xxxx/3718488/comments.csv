,madeofsteel,2007-06-22T06:46Z,"come on people, seed!!!

thanks for putting this all together!"
,urbanriot,2007-06-23T21:26Z,"I've already seeded 4x what I've downloaded, which isn't much at all... I've since lowered my upload rate until i can pull in more data. 

Ragnarxxx, have you tried tweaking your torrent software to prioritize users who are uploading more than leeching?"
,Ragnarxxx,2007-06-25T18:06Z,"i'm not entirely sure how to do that on Azureus to be honest. I just switched over from ABC because it  was making my computer unstable. I did however get fed up and just ran a really freaking long cable from my computer to the router. Its uploading at 130 KB/S now, and you'll all have your comics shorty!

again, really sorry for the hold up guys"

,urbanriot,2007-06-26T21:15Z,"It's not stuck - Since I've completed I've been hosting this torrent for a while.. I have been banning IP's that are using Bit Tyrant though, or those who are not uploading. "
,urbanriot,2007-06-26T23:42Z,9.cbr is missing!  What should it be?
,urbanriot,2007-06-28T03:48Z,"Ah, I found this torrent which has them in a slightly better order with a few of the ones missing here: http://isohunt.com/download/21746546/marvel+civil+war"
,trinitycross,2008-01-17T22:02Z,"Thank you for uploading! I just thought you should know, though-- Civil War #1 (as numbered 8th in your list) is only the Director's Cut and not the actual original issue."
,trinitycross,2008-01-18T14:19Z,"Captain America #25 is missing, as well."
