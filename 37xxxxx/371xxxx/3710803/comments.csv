sorry a bit late,

 you rename utup.bat to setup.bat

then you ONLY double click the install.bat 

thats all you have to do, ahhh forgot, really important while installin/injecting a rip is, 

not doing ANY background work! like, being online, or opening a window and doing anything there simple rename and double click install.bat (as far as i rember this was one folder back!...

After extracting i clicked install.exe, then a new folder popped up. Then i clicked etup.exe. I didn't have to rename it to make it work.

After a long ass wait when its finished. You take the folder. Gta.Sanandreas

The folder with all the game in it. Make sure its the last folder within the folders containing the game stuff. Bcuz after i was done i had like 3 gta folders within folders. 

Anyway. Just copy that Gta.Sanandreas folder into C:\program files

That solved the blank screen issue that pops up and goes back to desktop. Once i moved the folder into the correct directory it worked. But i still have no audio in cut scenes. if anyone has a solution for that speak up :D"

you have to UNRAR the game again into the same folder or any new one, and once you unrared you double click on ""etup.bat"" and you wait, (watch a movie) and dont do ANY background tasks , leave it alone while installing... that way you can be sure it will be a clear install!.... off here happy gaming

best thing would be to make this folder like above, THEN Unrar from downloaded files to this folder!.... ( dont move your old folder, were you already have tried install.) extract to ... and then double clicking ETUP.BAT should work aswell as renaming it to Setup.bat and starting with _install.bat.... good luck! and sorry for the inconvience..."

allowing your virustool deleting a false positive, no wonder why the shit doesnt work for you... ohwell over and over again

  the mostly byte by byte check error of 'em!.) This is truly a false information!.

  a so called false positive, you can read all about in your virustool manual or website!.

1) got and seeded torrent.
2) renamed etup.bat to Setup.bat
3) Clicked install
4) pressed any key like it said,
5) waited for it to finish,
6) made a folder called Rockstar Games in my program files.
7) copied all the installed data and stuff that was in the torrent, except the install file to the rockstar games folder
8) now it all works perfectly

För svenskar som inte kan engelska..

1) Ändra namn på Etup.bat till Setup.bat

2) Tryck på Install

3) Tryck bara på nån tangent

4) Vänta på att det ska installera klart

5) Gör en mapp i C:/Program som heter Rockstar Games

6) Kopiera alla saker i din torrent förutom Install Filen och klistra in i Rockstar Games mappen

7) Och nu ska det funka perfekt.."

,KillAWatt_1705,2007-10-03T18:32Z,"I've downloaded the game, it runs fine. I was fist confused wondering why there were so many parts to the folder, but I later figured they're all copies of the same file repeated 16 times. Why? I have no idea.

Its a real downfall that the torrent has no sound during cut scenes. If anyone does have a solution to the problem to the no sound in cut scenes issue I would greatly appreciate a solution. 

Subzero, this is a nice torrent, though it would have been far better if you had included ALL the components for the game - In this case,  the sound. And I would also recommend next time including more precise instructions and details, along with being more helpful when people ask you a question regarding installation issues or your mistakes, rather than throwing around the term ""idiots"" at everyone.
"
,Wasgood ,2007-10-04T11:45Z,I think there is a posibility that the sound bug actually CAME with the game not as a result from the rip.
,KillAWatt_1705,2007-10-04T15:52Z,"There's a high probability that it could just be a bug.   Though I'm sure it can be repaired by copying the  original components of the game and replacing them with ones supplied with the download.

If anyone has got the same game but different from this download, could they copy the sound related components and post it up for a download? Perhaps that'll fix these sound issues."
,4ndr3w,2007-10-05T12:30Z," Subzero! 
This is getting very confusing this..
I have NO idea whats happening..
When i change the ' etup.exe ' to ' setup.exe ' ..
and then i click on the icon ' gta_sa ' .. it loads so far, but as soon as the Grand Theft Auto screen shows after the 2 'adverts' - it close's and tells me: '''gta_sa.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close.  We are sorry for the inconvenience.'''
and when i click on the ' _install ' i get:

[V],Subzero!,2007-10-09T21:30Z,"A staggering 65% of problems which a PC encounters, whether in
business or at home, are not caused by hardware problems, they
are not caused by viruses, they are not caused by spam, but...

They are caused by background tasks belonging largely to
legitimate and well-known software you use every day.
and also to Pc users themself especially those who ignore
install-info-descriptions, or similiar instructions concerning a release.

From PC lock-ups to illegal operations, Internet Explorer crashes,
slow-downs, and other frustrations, many problems purely and
simply come down to what is running in the background on your
PC and currently demanding attention by the computer.

The trick to having a PC that runs smoothly is to know which background
tasks are essential, which are not, and which only need to run sometimes.
By managing these processes more intelligently your system can free up
more memory, run more reliably and avoid crashes and lock ups."

I had to adjust some of the settings to get the framerate correct but it's okay now.

I'm currently downloading a torrent from TPB called ""Grand Theft Auto San Andreas - The Complete Soundtrack"" which contains most of the sound files for the game, so after that's done i'll put them in the right place and tell you if it works :)"

,pintas_h,2009-05-19T21:45Z,"i have a question regarding the installation part.

""1.Download this torrent.
2.Go to where it downloaded and open the first .part01 file with WinRAR.
3.Extract the components in the file to a specific folder say ""My Documents"" for example only.
4.Go to My Documents and find the GTA.San.Andreas folder.
4a.Rename the file ""etup"" to ""setup"" without the quotes ("") 
4b.Go back to My Documents and double-click the file ""_install"".
5.Let it install and extract which will take a long time (about2-4hours, mine took about 4hrs no lie!). Do not do any background processes, so just install it whenever you have free time or not going on the computer.

7. It should start up, it might ask you about this file, just click use or don't use. Then your good to go! If it did not work, reinstall it. ""

So heres my questions:

1. Do i move all 12 or just the first part01? seems weird to only move that one and let the others be in the ""download"" map

2. Do i have to do the thing with the ""etup"" -> setup and then _install with all parts?

hope to get a nice answer, its not tricky questions!

thanks."

1. CREATE A FOLDER ""ROCKSTAR GAMES"" IN
    C:\PROGRAM FILES. Im sure you probably should be able to create the folder in the drive, folder you want to install the game but im not sure abt this.

2. OPEN YOUR DOWNLOAD FOLDER AND EXTRACT ONLY ""PC_GTA.SanAndreas -(rip)-(ToeD).part01"" TO C:\PROGRAM FILES\ROCKSTAR GAMES.

3. THEN RENAME etup.bat to Setup.bat.

4. GO BACK ONE FOLDER AND DOUBLE CLICK _install.bat .

5. HOORAY YOUR GAME SHOULD WORK. MINE DID STRAIGHT AWAY.

DO NOT DO ANY BACKGROUND TASKS AT ALL OR RUN ANYTHING ELSE. THE ONLY THING I HAD RUNNIN WAS NORTON.

THE TORRENT WAS VERY FAST AND THE INSTALL TOOK PROBS ABT AN HOUR BUT NO PROBLEMS.

PEOPLE THE INTRO, TRAILER, DIALOGUES AND RADIO STATIONS ARE NOT INCLUDED. I HAVENT FOUND A TORRENT BUT AS OTHERS ARE SAYING I GUESS THEY ARE TORRENTS FOR THAT.

yes, it is a .BAT file, it opens a command prompt to run. look it up.

this is a rip of a cd, ofcourse your antivirus will think its bad, it is modifying code so the game can run. that is the nature of cracking/ripping

if it crashes on bootup, that is not the fault of the torrent. that is something wrong with your computer, or you have hardware/software the game wont support.


if you have vista and it doesnt work, go FUCK yourself, thats not the torrents fualt that vista sucks.

if you have vista nad it works, dont bitch that its working fine for you and how you love vista, nobody cares.


you people need to do your fucking research before making stupid ass fucking remarks. gezuz christ you guys are dumb."

,5ive6ix7even8ight,2009-08-22T17:13Z,"I found a way to get the rest of the missing cutscene sounds and other hidden sounds, including the pedestrian voices. You have to download Subzero's ultimate version of the game. Then you replace the six main folders of this rip with the ones from the ultimate version, and there you go - you can now hear everything.

I downloaded the ultimate version especially for the rest of the sounds - for almost 19 hours at 60 kbps. The game didn't work for me though because of my system (definitely not because of the torrent itself, it's perfectly good!!), so I was quite pissed. I was reading the comments to see what others were saying, and somebody suggested to just replace all the main folders. Did that, and voila. Now all the sounds are there, and it hasn't crashed or anything either.

I'm just letting you all know this as a suggestion. If you really want the missing sounds from here and you wanna dl the ultimate version, go ahead. It takes a while though but it's worth it (for me, at least.)"

,kotuwa,2010-10-19T21:10Z,"For People who get Decompression Problems!!! 
============================== 

Run ""etup.bat"" manually. 
Do not run ""_install.bat"" 



I do not know what happened, the file that supposed to be ""setup.bat"" is ""etup.bat"" (s is missing) after i extracted. Strange... I think who all recently downloaded this face this problem.
But the comments show early downloaders had no problems with it!
We can not decompress the game by running ""_install.bat"" since that bat invoke ""setup.bat"".
But there is no ""setup.bat"" but ""etup.bat"". Running ""etup.bat"" works :)

This game works. But no audio in cutscenes and no radio audio.


But the audio directory is 3GB!.. What is the size of the Audio folder in FULL game? anyone know?)
Which files are missing in this release? Can we replace them?


(And that 3GB audio folder can be compressed into 300mb using WinRAR. While UHARC compress the game into 600mb, WinRar can compress it to 800mb. Saves the time!)



**
another problem. my machine is quite good. i can play CoD4. but i can't play San Andreas in 32bit colors. Lag, Delay, Slower gameplay and low FPS. But 16bit colors work well.
If you face the same problem, change your bit deapth to 16bit :)
