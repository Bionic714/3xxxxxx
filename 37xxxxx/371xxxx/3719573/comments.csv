,joannellis,2007-06-22T18:38Z,"Umm...if you mean that I uploaded this torrent before, then yes.  Somehow Bittorrent deleted them, and, well, long story short I recreated a few instead of just regenerating with the same name.  

I'm learning.  Can you handle that?  I hope so!"
,anssetfair,2007-12-31T02:25Z,"@all: this is ""joannellis"" - due to some strange login/profile issue, i will now be operating under this new username of ""anssetfair."" 

hope to get you some more good uploads soon!

peace,

,david252,2012-01-30T21:14Z,Can you clarify whether this is the original or re-mastered.  I have both - original is VMB but unfortunately mine is on vinyl & scratched to buggery.  Thanks.
,david252,2012-01-30T22:08Z,Just listened to it - it's original recording - perfect.  Thanks +++.
