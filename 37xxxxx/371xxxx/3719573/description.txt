The album that got me into the band, which was about 15 years ago, when I would hole up with some good classic rock and a sci-fi novel...ah, this brings back memories!

The prog pioneers at their finest released Tales in 1973, a double-album, a "concept album" as it were.  If stories hold true, I believe this album was the final straw for virtuoso keyboardist Rick Wakeman, who jumped ship shortly after (or was it during?) its release.  I suppose he and I differ in our opinion of the album...

I highly recommend their live show if you can get out to the next tour, and just about every studio album is exceptional.  Every dvd I've seen of theirs - professional, not bootleg - is riveting, kick-ass, and just plain ol' good rock!
