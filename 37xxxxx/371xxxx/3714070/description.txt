This has all the elements of a good bootleg recording - raunchy good show, Johnny insults the audience, wild party tunes, but also bad sound. One of the better ones. This has some of the best audience interaction ever caught on tape, if you've read 'In Cold Blood' you'll recognize them starting with track 01.
