,hra,2007-08-26T17:16Z,"Thanks, it works "
,dark_gable_64,2007-08-31T15:33Z,"This didn't work for me as it appeared to accept the registration info, only to advise me upon the next reload of the program that I have the unregistered/trial version with a 300Mb image limit; perhaps this name & serial combo has been over-utilized......dunno:

However, @PSXGAMEPRO has the best release of this app on the bay at the following link:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3782004

Create your own custom name and/or license number with this release.(No virues, no adware etc..,)


\\\\Big ups to @psxgamepro////"
,Nitride,2007-10-01T20:33Z,"Doesn't seem to work for me.
I put the Name + Reg code 9in, and the pop up box closes and nothing much happens.

Shame, but nice try :)"

,anonznet,2008-01-10T20:08Z,"Can u be more clear for which version of magic iso , i tried for my one it didnt work."
,SuperMarioLecter,2008-02-16T22:52Z,Didn't work at all..
,thebigguyconnor,2008-02-22T22:49Z,"Ya know, this ain't even really worth it's own torrent - One, because it doesn't work on the newest version... if you'd have specified the version this one's for then we'd be all off well, but since you didn't, we're all lost.  Two, because since it's only a txt, you could've posted it in the comments field: and I will, so people won't have to download it.

oh yeah, and I had to put breaks in that, so you may wanna backspace those breaks as you paste it into the MagicISO *insert version number here* Program."
,mmx9999,2008-03-09T23:37Z,"Doesn't work, no reaction, still unregistered version."
,afmelking,2008-03-25T21:55Z,"Which version is this for??? It only works for some versions, i had 5.4.251, it didn't work for that. If you have problems just uninstall and download this one: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3917782/Magic_ISO_Maker_5.4_with_serial
The serial thats included there works for that version."
