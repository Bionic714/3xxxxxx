However, it's absolutely pointless to dump the files into a single rar file.

Compressed audio files will not compress further to any appreciable degree, and a single rar provides no protection against data corruption - in fact, it makes it much worse, since without par files, one bad byte in the entire download will require re download of the entire file, instead of just the one bad chapter.

I know there is a horseshit ""scene"" practice of doing this, but it's just dumb, and the only reason people do it is because SomeoneElseSaidSo.

Try not to take offense at my rant - this is a pet peeve of mine and I get fed up enough to post about it once or twice a year.

It was just your turn."
