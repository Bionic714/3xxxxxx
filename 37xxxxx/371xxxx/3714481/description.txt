..:: Synopsis ::..

Maverick author Hunter S. Thompson introduced the world to "gonzo journalism" with this cult classic, which shot back up the best-sellers list after Thompson's suicide in 2005. No book ever written has more perfectly captured the spirit of the 1960's counterculture.

In Las Vegas to cover a motorcycle race, Raoul Duke (Thompson) and his attorney Dr. Gonzo (inspired by a real-life friend of Thompson) are quickly diverted to search for the American Dream. Their quest is fueled by nearly every drug imaginable and quickly becomes a surreal experience that blurs the line between reality and fantasy. Of course there is more to this hilarious tale than reckless behavior - for underneath the hallucinogenic facade is a stinging criticism of American greed and consumerism.

"A scorching epochal sensation!" -Tom Wolfe
