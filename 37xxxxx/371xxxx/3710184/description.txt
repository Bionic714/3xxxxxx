Martin Page's 'In the House of Stone & Light' is a true masterpiece. 
Released in '94 Martin's debut album/CD contains 10 of the most poetic, lyrical, heartmoving and infectious compositions you'll ever hear. 

In my opinion one of the best albums ever when it comes to this genre!

Hope you like it!
