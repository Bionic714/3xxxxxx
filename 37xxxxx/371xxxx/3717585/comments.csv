,esharh,2008-04-03T12:32Z,"please seed this!! been looking for it for a while...
thank u!!"
,dousch,2008-04-13T16:33Z,"Varför bränna när man bara kan köra alla avi filer i VLC och mysa framför datorn, om inte datorskärmen duger kan du ju skaffa en 19¨ som jag, dom är bra. ^^ Men annars är det bara att bränna i Nero, inte svårt. Kan ta några 10tal skivor att få ner alla dock."
,bobdel,2008-10-24T05:01Z,"Thanks for posting this one as I had already had finished a previous Season 1-4 full series which took a lot of waiting time.

I had 16.16 gigs downloaded an woul dhav been finished in a day but I couldn't find the torrent so I wa left to delete the series as it was an I'm now starting from the begining.

I was wondering is this the same one as the other torrent I was downloading  as this one like the other torrent had ""Torrent Downloaded From Demonoid"" 

Also why are some of the series got DIVx, while some have wmv files?"

,AB1993,2010-04-04T06:45Z,"This series has perhaps the hottest characters in a kids' cartoon ever! I found it when I was a teenager and tried to hide the fact that I'd watch it regularly only for that reason. The stroylines are embarrassingly stupid, but what do you expect from a kids' show? Shakespeare? 

Since then I wondered where it had gone. Thank you so much for posting these here. It will be fun watching them again; It's weird to think that I'm now the same age as the characters instead of some pis-ant 13 year old boy though. hahaha :)"
