This Week's Video Replay Review is a very impressive game between GermanSupreme and Nuvion on Angoville.  Both of them are in the clan Reborn and they certainly show their skills this match.  What makes this match interesting is that GermanSupreme is playing allies this time (all other times on ToH he was axis) and that we have a Defensive Doctrine vs. Infantry Company matchup.  You don't want to miss this one!
