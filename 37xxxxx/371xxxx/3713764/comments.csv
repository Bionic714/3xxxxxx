,DenAnden,2007-09-21T12:09Z,Hey Mlody.. thx for uploading all these soundtracks. but i was wondering if u got the soundtrack for smallville season 6?? 
,Ender2006,2008-07-21T01:15Z,"absolutely amazing uploads.  Greatly enjoyed the music from all of these five seasons you've provided.  As the previous commentator mentioned Season 6 & 7 would be equally appreciated.  Also, just as a recommendation,  a naming format that identified them by episode under grouping and labels them all as Smallville - Season 5 under album makes them much easier to import into something like iTunes.   "
