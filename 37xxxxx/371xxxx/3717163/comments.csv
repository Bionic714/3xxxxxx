,tlOd,2007-06-20T17:56Z,"Not Really, But It Can Pass."
,SoftSense,2007-06-21T08:04Z,"thx for UL and all that.
but wtf is up with the installer? thats the dumbest way to install a game ever... you have no controll over the install at all ... why?"
,tlOd,2007-06-21T12:35Z,"Can You Just Be Happy With The Game. And That Is Not The Dumbest Way To Install Game. You Have Control. Just Click On 'X' And You Will Quit The Setup. This Is The RiP, So That Means The Game Is Commpresed With One Very Good Program. If You Have More Questions.... I'm Here."

,testing2,2007-12-28T04:18Z,"also, for the record, yes, that was an absolutely retarded way to install a game.
You seriously need to learn better methods then outdated early 90's stuff.
But, just as well, my fault for not going with a proven uploader, and trying someone new like this tlod guy."
