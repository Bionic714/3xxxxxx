,soulcutter21,2007-09-19T06:38Z,"For the record, you can't just burn this and play it on the real thing.  You need to mod your PS1 or PS2 to be able to play burnt games."
,GoldenAlchemist,2008-03-29T14:01Z,I needs a password? What is the password then?
,uchiharjuna,2008-06-18T13:27Z,seed!seed!seed!I badly want to play this game again!T_T

,spyderbrd,2008-06-27T10:57Z,uchiharjuana its not the game there is a fps bug in your Psx emulator. you can fix it by changeing your video plugin and if that doesnt work then configure the video plugins fps until you get nthe right speed... your welcome in advance.

,edensg,2009-01-27T01:00Z,"I'm picking up I.P. addresses from the Marine corp in japan, as well as the Israel Local Authorities Data Processing Center Ltd...I don't know if its serious, but you may want to use caution if you get this."
,edensg,2009-01-27T01:21Z,"False alarm, I guess.  Might just be my proxy."
,edensg,2009-01-27T02:33Z,"I think the FMVs were cut out of this to save space.  And because of it, the game will freeze before the first boss fight starts about an hour into the game.  It worked perfectly while it lasted, but if you want to PLAY the game, I would look for a different torrent."
,karunama,2009-01-27T06:21Z,"2 things.  1st, Edensg, you need to update to to ePSXe 1.70.  The torrent is fine.  Secondly, if you want to play a burned copy of this on your Playstation, you need to mod it to run regular cds.  It isn't very hard, and you can google instructions for it too."
,pjanssen,2009-12-17T07:00Z,"This is a great download, great game also, my favorite>>>"
,Unirea,2009-12-31T23:00Z,"How do you put this on PlayStation? I tried with Alcohol 120 % but when I put CD in PlayStation there is no picture , only sound...Please help me out... "
,gravi_fan89,2010-05-14T08:28Z,"Do you need a password?  There's a comment about that on here, so I have to ask."
,aussie114,2011-01-29T13:55Z,"Thank you so much eahn, burnt this to CD and played it on a chiped playstation 1 console, works perfectly."
,guitargod01lovesBJJ,2011-04-18T09:57Z,"i unzipped it and got an iso file. i placed it in the iso folder of my psp but the psp says that the file is corrupted. could you please help me out?

,provalactic,2011-05-13T05:01Z,Hey Ive already started this game on PSX and like edensg said it does freeze up at the very first boss.  Plus i beat the first suikoden using PSX so i have the save file on that.  It may work perfectly fine on ePSXe but i dont have my save point nor my suikoden 1 save file it would just be a hassel pretty much...anyone know how to make it work on PSX before i go and do an hour or so of stuff over again?
,sublimemaco,2012-05-19T09:05Z,"can't play this on pcsxbox, turns black screen after first fight, any clues??"
