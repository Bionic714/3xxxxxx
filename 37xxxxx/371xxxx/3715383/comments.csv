,abbey4000,2007-06-16T15:19Z,"Is this a converted avi file, or is it the actual dvd screener?"
,Windsong1,2007-06-16T19:12Z,This is the dvd screener.sorry about the download rate I had to many peers. have it set right now swarm speed is running at any where from 20Kb to 50Kb now should have more seeds online sometime tonite :)
,torrentaddicts,2007-06-17T06:48Z,Still at 49%...
,Kugghjulspojken,2007-06-18T23:20Z,"This is the real deal. SuperB quality and nothing to complain to.

Thanx for the upload!"
,earjam818,2007-06-19T12:24Z,is this ntsc or Pal?
,darealdmt,2007-06-19T13:10Z,"lol, the title says Sicko-roger_moore.

as in Michael moore, the director of ""Roger and Me"" lol.

Roger Moore haha."
,sentone,2007-06-19T16:27Z,I DLd another NTSC converted copy and the video stutters and is more pixelated than the canal street release. Does the video run smoothly on this one?  
,kongdvd,2007-06-19T19:27Z,"Michael Moore finally now says 9/11 Could Be Inside Job:

""bombs in WTC buildings... missing video of Pentagon attack...""

Video of it all here:

,markerb,2007-06-20T18:22Z,"It has pretty low video quality, and the MP3 audio track doesn't work in my Yamaha S550 DVD hardware player, but does in my software players.  That's odd, because that Yamaha can play just about anything I throw into it."

Thanks a million!

Perhapes you should have your Yamaha S550 DVD hardware player repaired. Or Check the disk for abrasions before buring?

Or perhaps you two work for Michael Moore's producer the Weinstein Company? I hear that they are a little pissed about this film getting online.could it be they might have payed somebody to slow the flow.

On the other hand it could be the US gov.... there getting really embarrassed by this Documentary? hOMEie land Security tried to grab the film before it came out, but guess it's to late now... with it's global release on the internet.

On brighter side maybe this film will help get Hillary elected. Health care is really a big issue with her,

,mproleik,2007-06-20T23:10Z,"i'm gonna say it again since there seems to be unwarranted negative reviews of this torrent... the image burned fine and the audio and video could not be described as anything other than dvd quality.  in addition, my first download was the most popular xvid release on piratebay... it failed to work for me (said i was missing a video codec... which was unusual).  I've already seeded this to share ratio of 8 and will continue to because i believe it is the best or one of the best out there!   Appreciate the upload by Windsong1 and wish that the critics posting comments on here would just shut the hell up!"
,giuliana,2007-06-21T06:28Z,I am trying to burn this in Toast 8 but it is telling me there is no data in this iso file.  I've also tried to burn it via Video_TS folder but it says its empty as well.  Anyone else have this problem or am I doing something wrong?
,Bolerophon,2007-06-21T12:37Z,"This is normal .avi version upscaled to DVD.
avi quality, good sound and watchble. "
,mproleik,2007-06-21T21:48Z,"videoadvocate:  If i may correct you, i never bashed anyone elses torrents.  i simply stated my experience... thats what these comments are supposed to be about.  this torrent was a good experience for me.  the other one was not.  And, to answer a previous question you asked about the video quality... i did not see any ""interlacing artifacts"" as i watched this on my large tv.  so, maybe it isn't a conversion of an .avi.  Instead of speculating, why dont you download it for yourself and tell us what you think?  But before you do... please let me know your IP address so i dont ""waste my bandwidth"" on you"
,jdbidwell,2007-06-22T00:45Z,"Please seed.  Very slow. After viewing the xvid version, it's clear that the bootleg release is a black op by the subjects of the film to blunt the incredible impact that seeing it in a theater will have on society.  Keep that in mind when sharing.  Get ready for a disinformation campaign by the Right like nothing yet seen.  They can't afford to have people think."
,Windsong1,2007-06-22T04:27Z,"well if you dips took more that five mn to look at a film before you pass judgement you might have discovered that there is a reason the first few mins look like a home vid..... because Michael Moore did use a home vid at the start of the film lol... i am glad you figured that out, Now mabe you can watch the rest of the film and see the quality"
,billycrenshaw,2007-06-26T06:04Z,"this is a very poor quality rip, and a waste of 4.19 GB torrent.  The video quality is terrible.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!"
,Windsong1,2007-06-26T20:28Z,"Its been download 186 times, I dont see a single comment saying its fake?

I smell Torrent Box Faggots!!!!!!

Jelaous again I see.

wots the difference between torrentbox & a cow pat?


nothing, they are both full of shit!!"
,Uncle_Ian,2007-06-26T22:42Z,"Thanks for the upload, Windsong1. 

I finished downloading this torrent a couple of hours ago.  Since then, I've burned the iso to DVD-R and have watched the first 42 minutes of the film.  I reassure you all that this is indeed Michael Moore's ""Sicko,"" and that the video and audio are very good.  Why the uploader attached *Roger* Moore's name to the file is something perhaps left to James Bond to investigate. 

The video is not of commercial DVD quality, but rather more like VHS quality.  Whether this is what the original movie looks like I cannot say.  And there's a very brief glitch of artifacts just before the 37-minute mark.  But all that said, this is a very watchable version of ""Sicko."" 

So while it is a big download, you can all rest assured that this file is the real deal.  And thanks again for the upload, Windsong1.  This isn't an avi expanded to DVD format though, is it? "
,Uncle_Ian,2007-06-27T01:16Z,"I've just finished watching the entire movie, as provided by Windsong1.  Very good quality from start to finish.  Too bad it's such a large file, but it's very much worth seeing; Michael Moore's best so far in my opinion. 

I am currently seeding this torrent. "
[T],Roys,2007-07-02T00:35Z,"It is strange when not even a ""Holy Picture"" can make people seed properly!?!
I personally always let my computer seed when I go to bed.
And ofcourse I choose what files are worth seeding but then I seed these to the fullest!!!
Michael Moore is always worth seeing and always worth seeding (He has himself said that he don't have anything against filesharing)...

Worth seeing --- Worth seeding!"
,kongdvd,2007-07-04T08:50Z,"Sicko is a good and important doc. You are now ready for something even more important:

Who beats that?"
,Rykiddo,2007-07-24T10:39Z,"I would be very careful whenn downloading this film from any source.  I downloaded a copy from another torrent that has now vanished that was on The Pirate Bay and within a few hours I received an e-mail that was forwarded to me from my I.S.P about a copyright infringement violation threatening legal action if I didn't stop seeding the file immediately.  Anyway, you have been warned."

,Ubehage,2007-09-17T17:29Z,"wow... Sicko!!!

I am glad to be living in a country where we still know what democracy and healthcare means..."
,banman,2007-09-27T01:56Z,"Because of all of the strange comments. This is not dvdrip. The picture quality is like old vhs. No menu, no chapters or options.The 2.0 sound is good, probably untouched. It is more than watchable. Don`t need to be top picture quality when it`s a documentary?  Buy the way, are there any americans here? I almost don`t believe this film. That`s a tough society you have there. You should grant yourself a better health system. "
,Chimairo,2007-09-28T19:48Z,"Every american,  American Politician or goverment employee or whatever should really watch it and  learn something from this documentary, and get yourself a better healthcare system. yours is obvious not working at all. Youre only thinking about money, that's all... money money money.

I've always been thinking like; ""oh man how i like to live in the us"" ...but not anymore. I rather live in Canada. not only 'cause healthcare system ..in general i think canadians seems nicer."
,Agurk,2007-10-07T16:41Z,Nice!
