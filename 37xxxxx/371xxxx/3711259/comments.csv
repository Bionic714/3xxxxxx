Please forgive my little brothers IGNORANCE.

He has already Pissed a lot of the flight-sim community off. He suffers from a congenital defect commonly known as RUNNING OFF AT THE FUCKING MOUTH which unfortunately he inherited from our dear mother. He is classic example of a small child gone bad which I fear is the result of his direct involvement in the WOZ (WORLD OF ZEROS) Community, of which he is a member. 

They have a complete and utter dis-regard for TPB and the exceptional job that TPB has done over the years. They do not remember the time when TPB was the only REAL game in town and  now they have been CONNED into believing they have INVENTED something new. They are in fact just Pirates like everyone else but choose to Hide their little secret behind a Burqa. They are in fact just a bunch of LOSERS in the widest possible sense. 

Would you believe that 75% of THAT GREAT COMMUNITY has never made a Post? Yes that's right, NOT !! ONE !! FUCKING !! POST!!!. Check for yourself that is one big fucking achievement they should be mighty proud of. They are not only FACE-LESS but most unfortunately They are CLUE-LESS as well. So I will try my utmost to monitor his (and others) behaviors and correct them when I see the need.

?Cause I'm not into that credit stuff, that's what a .nfo file is for. Where was the credit given when someone took the two Zenertek products I purchased & posted it on TPB/UseNext/WF? Here's the answer; I got a letter from the Zenertek folks, saying they traced my serial & is now threatening to sue. Where was the credit given when someone took the JustFlight Schweizer 300CBi that I purchased & posted it on TPB/UseNext/WF!? I can go on & on, so to answer your question - I don't give a damn about bullshit credit(s)....The End!?

Sure teaching his Kiddies (and my brother) good manners. Shows how intelligent he is too sharing that kind of info in the wild REAL BRIGHT LIGHT.

,Sataris,2007-06-12T05:05Z,"Most people do remember when TPB was the only game in town,

Most people do remember when TPB wasn't full of fucktards

But i don't expect you or anyone else here (except 4X) to remember that

you can hate on WoS all you want

its no different to Usenet or WF

and i'm on all 4, so i can get whatever it is i wants

so continue hating, i'll be flying the LDS 767"
,FlightPirate,2007-06-12T07:39Z,was that a request for the levelD767?
,Sataris,2007-06-12T08:24Z,"yep, enjoy the hudson

,Sataris,2007-06-12T08:27Z,"btw, why the fuck do you care so much?

you've got TPB, if you want a little more you pay for 

Wicked Friends

if you want a little more than that you pay for

WoS

UseNet

,Panodilo,2007-06-12T18:07Z,"I've been just excellent, Sataris. And productive too! Yesterday I uploaded the Aerosoft Hannover scenery to Avsim and passed it of as my own original work. Now I'm sitting naked with my hairy ass in a black leather sofa waiting for the shit to hit the fan. I'm excited, and my neighbours won't need binoculars to see that."
,Sataris,2007-06-12T18:14Z,"ahh, brings back memories!
