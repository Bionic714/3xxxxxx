,gameric3,2007-06-13T05:14Z,Seed!
,zLaEroFmI,2007-06-16T05:59Z,Downloaded 127 times but only 6 seeders? This is why private trackers are better
,zLaEroFmI,2007-06-16T06:02Z,"But yeah, aside from the fact that it will never finish, amazing upload... thank you... the first season is the only one I've seen"
[T],Supafly2000,2007-06-22T01:29Z,"PEOPLE!!!

I assure you that there has only been one seeder until about 5 minutes ago. You would not have seen it, though, since it was using ""Initial Seeding"".

There has only been one other peer that fully downloaded the files and that was only five minutes ago.

The ""seeders"" and ""downloaded"" numbers on this site which show 11 and 245 respectively are wrong. It is only 2 and 1. There are fake clients out there that mess with these numbers.

Anyways... I am glad I helped keep Sopranos alive during the Season Six run when fakes were popping up everywhere.

Come back when the Season 6b DVDs are released for an updated download!

:-)"

dolby ac3acm.acm 

This is the answer - scared me for a while "
,Inspectah13,2008-10-17T08:02Z,"Been downloading for weeks and im only at 25%, please seed."
,sinsinnati,2008-11-16T16:52Z,"I might suggest that those downloading set the priority of the individual files accordingly. 

That's the only collaborative effort I can suggest since I've yet to see people here change their ratios/habits on request."
,RedMelon,2008-11-23T11:18Z,"I keep getting stuck. PLEASE SEED, already!

thank you!"
,Jorf,2008-12-31T12:17Z,"As BostonMike said, one season at a time is the way to go, at least if you're downloading a bit slow."
,caine3320,2009-01-04T04:45Z,"season by season is a much better way to go. i did that for mythbusters, bullshit, the west wing, and flying circus, and other than the initial block of episodes, i didn't have to wait to start watching. most of the time i was watching episodes from about a season or two behind what was finished downloading. worked great. 

i'll be sure to seed this for a while; a 1TB drive sure makes that easier than it used to be!"
,troy69,2009-02-06T11:49Z,"I really miss Tony and both of his familys, so this is just GREAT.

Thx"
,Luvs2drive,2009-04-06T07:36Z,"PLEASE SEED GUYS!!! ARGH. Getting a whopping 2.3kb/s and it's killing me! Got 160 on Saturday NZ time but shite since then.Please seed this, I will seed for months if I can get this whole series."
