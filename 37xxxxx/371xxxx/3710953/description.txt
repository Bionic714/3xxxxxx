The Sopranos - Full Series

No bullshit fakes!

Eighty-six down... zero to go!

Seasons 1 and 5 are ~700MB per episode. The rest are ~350MB per episode.

Seasons 1-6a are DVD rips while 6b is TV rips.

It's been fun this past season (6a and 6b) combating the rampant fakes that were going around and even more fun the past eight years watching this phenomenal show.

Have fun watching it all over again and again like I will.
