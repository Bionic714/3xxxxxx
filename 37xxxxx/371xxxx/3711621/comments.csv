,neocorpse,2008-02-17T01:27Z,"Keygen comes up as a trojan, but I'm willing to bet money it's just by nature of what it is. Avast picked it up so I doubt it's malicious."

,wizayne,2008-09-14T15:40Z,"PEOPLE:

i'm not going to rant about how keygens often show as virus/trojan infected 

you can avoid the ill effects by running them in a virtual space. the program is called Sandboxie and I've never feared running a keygen with it. 

Get it, got it, GOOD!

Thanks for the plugin suite, Issaquah"
,Gijoey,2009-04-05T05:22Z,Norton Antivirus 2009 had a hit on keygen.exe and classified as a backdoor trojan.  I've never had a false alarm on a keygen in over 3 years.  Weird
