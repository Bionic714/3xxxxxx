This is an old, good Skype client v 2.5.0.141

It is *much* faster and smaller than the current (v. > 3.0) versions. And so far it is still fully compatible with the Skype network (both Skype2Skype and SkypeOut). 
I put it here for those of you, who don\\\'t have too fast computers and still want to use Skype. 

Min. system requirements: pentium 300-400 MHz

Enjoy!
