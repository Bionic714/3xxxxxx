,eragonshadeslayer,2009-07-21T11:18Z,"You don't need the original Stormblast, fools! The new one is much better!"
,KK4P,2009-07-24T23:52Z,"This torrent is worthless. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! No original Stormblast (to the guy who said the new one is better anyways: I hope you're trolling, if not, please find a small dark place to starve). Most of the tracks just cut out 3/4 way through, track listings are completely out of order. So yeah, don't waste your time."
