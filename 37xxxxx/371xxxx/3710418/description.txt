Jumbotron
Richard Stanley
2007

This torrent contains Richard Stanley?s 2007 debut album ?Jumbotron?. It?s totally free, so you aren?t breaking any laws by downloading it via bit torrent, and you?re quite welcome (encouraged even!) to seed your copy for others to leech. 

The album is pretty different from anything else that?s likely to be released this year. Instead of drawing his inspiration from the usual sources e.g. love, heartache, etc, Richard has instead to sing about cows, steak, sandwiches and big hairy gorillas. Recorded at home with little more than an acoustic guitar and a rudimentary understanding of how to play it, Richard has created something original, interesting and, most importantly, free!

If this torrent has no seeders, you can also download the album from http://www.esnips.com/web/Jumbotron. You?ll need to take a couple of minutes to join eSnips (it?s free to do so) before you can actually download the files.
