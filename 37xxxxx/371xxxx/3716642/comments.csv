but fucking rapidshare sucks..

[T],ppsfilmi,2007-06-17T19:15Z,"okay, why it sucks? to slow ?
i downloaded 1.4gig from rapidshare in aproximatly 12 minutes (on 20 mbit line)

perhaps you didnt try which mirror works best for you? "
,death734,2007-06-17T20:24Z,"if you have an account (costs money) at rapid share then its great
other wise it would take all day (literally) to download something this big from there because of 2.5-3h wait times after starting each 100mb file"
,panchan1,2007-06-18T00:46Z,megaupload is a bit better. 500mb files.
