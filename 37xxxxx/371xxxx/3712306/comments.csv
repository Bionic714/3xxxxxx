,matriarchies,2011-09-16T06:43Z,"Downloaded series 1 and 2.  The reproduction quality of series 1 is pretty good, and looks like a DVD rip--I didn't notice any glitches, credits were intact (for as long as I watched them), no network TV overlays.  Series 2 is a little bit worse: it's a TV rip, with occasional glitches, and Channel 4 announcements during the end credits.  Otherwise pretty good."
,Johnpfw,2012-08-14T02:39Z,"Many thanks for uploading.
Have limited space on my seedbox but will seed to at least 10x. "
