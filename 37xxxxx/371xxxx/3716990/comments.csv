,lirarn__,2007-06-18T21:18Z,fake its virus on it
,Imperial,2007-06-20T23:49Z,"I apologize for your wait ,but I'm recently experiencing some hardware issues with my PC so haven't been able to seed.I assure you the file is not fake or a virus,but these are issues out of my control and very costly repairs.I'd advise trying to get the file elsewhere and again am sorry for your troubles. (At least I'm man enough to post the reason for not seeding instead of just leaving people hanging...Please flame someone else with your oh so witty comments.) It really pisses me off b/c this was aq very good version although I'd only rate the movie itself at a 4 out of 10..very disappointing compared to the first one."
