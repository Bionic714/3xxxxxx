The Elder Scrolls Part 2: Daggerfall

Well, what should I say?
This game is has the biggest gamingworld ever. Think it took 2 weeks to run from one end of the world to the other. (If I remember correct, some lame people really did it. :P)


Here you can download it with the last patch and all. This is a classic!


(If you google on daggerfall patches u'll even find installers making it possible to install it on newer windows versions, but I use my dear old IBM 486 to play it :))


Enjoy
