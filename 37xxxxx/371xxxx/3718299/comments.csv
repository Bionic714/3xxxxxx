,ursak,2007-06-19T18:31Z,"Since I'm still seeding all other torrents I've put up my speed may not be the quickest. Not my fault thought since it seems over 50 people have downloaded my other torrents, but only 3-5 are seeding them afterwards. SO PLEASE SEED AFTER DOWNLOAD IS FINISHED! Please! "
,svensk_huvudverk,2007-06-20T04:36Z,"weeeeee!!!! 10 beer to ursak,,,
thanks allot mate."
,ursak,2007-06-20T09:20Z,"Oh, Beer is always welcome! :)"
,ursak,2007-09-21T10:06Z,"Since my computer broke down, I'm not seeding anymore. :("
,Shadie_19,2007-10-03T22:59Z,"Well ursak im sorry to hear about ur pc, im new just got my account today(have been downloadin torrents here for a while tho). If there anyone who can seed this fopr me plz do so and when i have it ill seed it to.   thx"
,Shadie_19,2007-10-04T16:29Z,"So i left my downloader on all night and when i woke up i was at only 20%, after like 12 hours.im only downloading at 1 kb\s  and never any higher, i plan on seeding this file but i need someone to seed it for me.one other dude was downloading from me at 87 kb\s what is wrong is it cuase i dont use the program that pirates bay suggests, but then again i have never had a problem before."
,Shadie_19,2007-10-06T13:57Z,finally finished and have stared seeding    thx  alot  looks like a good game.
,MinikuiOni,2007-10-09T04:57Z,how do i get this game working? i can install it...but when i try to play the game it says something about that i have wrong disk? any ideas?
,psyconutheadkiller,2007-10-18T07:49Z,"man wtf is goin on here? it crashes as soon as i press ""install"" just a black screen comes up, it looks like its about to do something, but nothing happens, wen i bring up task manager it says that the daggerfall autorun is not respondin. anyone got any ideas?"
,ursak,2007-10-29T01:17Z,"This game is ooooold. There isnt much chance of making it work in winxp ""as-it-is"" and its 16-bit so vista is out of the question.

But... Get vdmsound (dos sound emulator) and DosBOX (Dos emulator) and run it thrue them and it will work.

WDMSOUND: http://sourceforge.net/projects/vdmsound/

DOSBOX: http://www.google.se/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdosbox.sourceforge.net%2F&ei=eSYlR5-qGYGYwwH4pZ2VAQ&usg=AFQjCNHFTxRHZkwESHdDlsIeYEnF8lvB0Q&sig2=txADnucmfRX9O5Ival6Rag"
,skynet1111,2007-11-24T03:16Z,Ill seed it for a while if anyone wants. I love this game and hope everyone can enjoy it (even with the bugs).
,ursak,2007-12-16T17:55Z,Not to many bugs after the updates :P
,oeolycus,2007-12-19T01:44Z,Anyone who can seed? I'm stuck at 82%.
,cthulhu221,2008-02-22T22:48Z,"I ran with ""nocd"" command and it told me ""illegal command"". Now what? I love this game and really want to play...."
,aDuLtsWiMbOi,2008-04-11T01:54Z,"anybody up for a challenge? i got one.  running daggerfall on my computer.  i have xp and i have downloaded the game but it wont install cuz of a ""invalid directory"" also i dont have the ""nocd"" file.  good luck trying to help me."
,cthulhu221,2008-04-13T02:41Z,"Sorry. I posted my previous question on the wrong link. It must be misleading. This link has the ""no-cd"" file. http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3529136/The_Elder_Scrolls_II__Daggerfall"
,cthulhu221,2008-04-13T02:46Z,"Also, some people are having compatibility issues with their video card. If this happens all I can suggest is updating yours. Good luck. Sorry, ursak, for pluging another torrent."
,SGT_Blades,2008-05-20T17:54Z,"Link to DOSBOX download page. (select win32 dl for XP and Vista)
http://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1
The DOSBOX emulator for Windows XP AND VISTA.
http://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Dosbox_and_Vista
Information about DOSBOX emulator for Vista.

I also recommend downloading WDMSOUND as ursak said 'cause newer pcs will most likely NOT support a lot of dosbox game sounds. "
,Mazzina,2008-10-19T13:11Z,"I've just started downloading, so should have it in about a month! (someone please seed!).  I've downloaded the DOSbox and WDMsound - is there anything else I need to know before I get too excited and frustrated after waiting for the game to download?  I love this game, haven't played it in years - my brother stole the disc! Git!"
,3261dan,2009-01-30T15:56Z,Thanks. Is working great.
