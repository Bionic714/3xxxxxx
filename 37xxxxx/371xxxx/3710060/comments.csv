Beware!"
,k0nsl,2007-06-10T14:18Z,"Frank Rennicke is an absolutely great folksinger - both Frank and his adoring wife Ute were sentenced to prison for the lyrics contained in the song ""Madagaskar"". Despite this, the Rennicke couple will continue to produce excellent songs which awaken the German 'Seele'. Infact, his music can of course be enjoyed by anyone despite being German or not. Enjoy!"

,universal208,2008-07-16T22:41Z,"Look no offence to the german people, which I personally respect, but this guy sounds like my dog after he pumped some weed up his brains. I mean, the songs, are ok, but the singer should seek another career preferably someplace where he has to keep quiet if you get my drift..."

,Pewpewlazers,2009-03-29T06:23Z,"Yes, this man is probably a 'nazi' but that doesn't stop him from producing great folk songs. I don't agree with a lot of his views but hearing him singing his heart out about ""deutchland"" is special. "
