,Lman_1,2007-06-10T16:31Z,"So Many THanksss....

,chlwotjd,2007-06-10T16:40Z,"it seems this doesn't work with cracked fsx SP1 version..

installation of FSC 8.0 and 8.1 update were successfully finished(dateabase import is also finished) but I get error message in Germany like ""Laufzeitfehler '62' : Einlesen hinter Dateiende""

And when i install FSUIPC 4 included, it says ""your FSX installation is not suitable for this verison of FSUIPC. You may need to install an update from Microsoft.. No changed have been made by this program""

Before i install the included FSUIPC 4, the latest version of FSUIPC 4 (v4.11) from dawson's website was installed already.  it's the same result after i remove exist v4.11 FSUIPC 

what's wrong? maybe due to the cracked dll's for SP1?  "
,chlwotjd,2007-06-10T16:49Z,"when i install the FSUIPC4 included in the tool folder, it says 

Installer for FSUIPC4.DLL version 4.06

Looking in registry for FSX install path:
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator\10.0
     Parameter""SetupPath""
SetupPath=""F:\FSX\""
Checking version of FSX.EXE:
... Version 10.0.61355.0  (Need 10.0.60905.0)


version mismatch? 

i have fresh installation of fsx and then SP1 with the cracked dll's for SP1

do you guys have no such a problem like me? "
,DakotaDC3,2007-06-10T17:56Z,"Hi, i just need the serial for this one because i already have the installer. Can anyone post the serial? Thanks."
,Proctologist,2007-06-10T18:00Z,"Have to agree with you on WOZ. Think the leeching is bad here well WOZ is no better. They got a hard core group of posters (maybe 15) and most of the rest are along for the ride. Their EAGLE420 is one super duper glory hound and ignorant as fuck too. Hang out for a while and the conversations in there get real tedious.You complain about kiddies here well that joint is full of them. I think the likes of Popart and Keyno when they park in that place must be thinking about retiring because that place is bringing nothing new to the table. Do not ask questions there because there will be no answer forthcoming.They are all too busy kissing the bosses collective asses to formulate an intelligent answer. They are great for hiding behind the V.I.P. shell and have conveniently FORGOTTEN that most have them in there were dependant on TPB for their existance. Shame on them and LON LIVE TPB.

,Proctologist,2007-06-10T22:24Z,"Well 4X looks like I stuck my finger up somebodys ass at WOZ real good! Been reading the shoutbox over there and seems THEY are listening in. You know, for an invite site they're really STUPID. Open the front door to everybody then bitch and whine when some one Scoops one of their precious Hush-hush ups. Not one fucking word said when they Borrow from Wickedfriends and repost. Yeah right thats okay because now its family. Kiddies over there are pulling their TPB posts but thats what could you expect from a bunch of losers anyway. About the finger thing. That's what us proctoligists do. Re-arrange somebody elses SHIT and they got a real big pile of that over there"
