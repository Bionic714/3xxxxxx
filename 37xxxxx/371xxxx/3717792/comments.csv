,fringe_lunatic,2008-07-19T02:01Z,Again we need a seeder for this one. There are now 4 of us at 91.8% Also could use (faster) seeders on 3 and 5. Please help if you can. 
,drronin112,2009-01-15T06:18Z,"Looks like Seasons 2 & 3 Have no Seeders anymore. Which is a Shame because I love the Season 4 with Menus I got from Blacknoon. 
I did get an average of 20 Some MB on the Season 2 and 3 Downloads From Blacknoon here (The ones that downloaded any at all), then they all just kinda stopped.  And I notice Season 2 disk 2 both have comments that their not being seeded anymore.  Makes me a Sad Panda, Blacknoon does great work."
