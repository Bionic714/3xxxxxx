- Release Notes
* Missed the airing so had to get the re-air 4H
later. but anyway, here is the 60fps rip.
* 592x336 vs 624x352 from analog or dsr source
really makes no difference in quality.
* This can be considered lossless motion.
29.97fps is half motion when compared to the 
tv broadcast.
* Suggested player: VLC videolan.org
WMP is junk and will probably go out of sync
* one more episode next week.
* Enjoy
