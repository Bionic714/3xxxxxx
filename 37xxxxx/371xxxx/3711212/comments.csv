,Dangerous_meatball,2007-06-16T11:37Z,In bitcomet it seeds automatictly after finnished and when you start it agin just click on the torrent and start. The most Bittorrent clients seeds automaticly. In some you need to set an option on like in azureus vuze you need have the advanced options on for seeding.
