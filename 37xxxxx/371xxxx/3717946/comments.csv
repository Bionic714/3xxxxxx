,brookvale,2007-08-17T02:31Z,Thanks - great video for us LR nuts - I'll seed. Anymore LR stuff?
,archstud,2007-08-27T09:43Z,"Have a few more things to share... it has been a while, but when I get a chance I will post them."
,queasyfish,2007-10-12T15:41Z,"Wow - thanks I've been looking for these for a while!  Watched it last night - super content.  Video was pretty pixelated at full screen, or anything close - but looked good small.  Please do post more as possible.  Please rip at higher quality if possible too.  I very much appreciate your efforts!"
,Roach131313,2007-10-22T02:28Z,"If I'm not mistaken, these clips were taken from the youtube release.  If anyone has the actual video released by Duke Video in the UK, could you rip a high quality copy and post that?
Thanks"
,archstud,2007-10-30T16:42Z,"Roach131313 is correct! These were taken from the Youtube postings. 

Quesyfish, I was lucky enough to find these, and yes they are pixelated at full screen, but this is better than nothing ;) I see someone has posted a higher resolution video from the 88-97 years. I grabbed it and it is also worth having, especially the bonus material!!!"
