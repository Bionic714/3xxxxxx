Out of print soundtrack for the Tim Burton bio-pic of schlock director Ed Wood, with music by Howard Shore.  Several tracks incorporate dialogue snippets from the movie, including the infamous "pull the strings!" line from "Glen or Glenda," as well as Lugosi's villanous monologue for world domination in "Bride of the Monster."  A must have for fans of this movie, as well as those of Ed Wood himself.
