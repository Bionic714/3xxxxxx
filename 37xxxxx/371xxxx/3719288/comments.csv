,Brandoncade,2007-08-20T03:30Z,"I have activated my norton product a couple of days ago for two years using the edge keygen here are some instructions on how to use it:

1.DISCONNECT FROM THE INTERNET! THIS IS IMPORTANT!
2.Run the installer, and run the keygen
3.Copy the Product Key from the keygen to the Norton Setup then press the I Agree button..
4.Complete installation and finally you will get to the activation, it's important that you are NOT connected to the Internet! Press the Next button.
5.A message box will come up telling you that you need Internet connectivity to continue, just press the OK Button, and then press the Next button.
6.You will get to a part where it's trying to connect to the Internet for online activation, after a while it will fail, this is fine, repeat this step again.
7.After attempting to do online activation two times, it will fail.
8.Select Phone Activation and press press the Next button.
9.Now copy the 36 digit Request Code into the Request Code field in the keygen, no dashes or spaces just one long 36 digit string. Select how many years you want to license the software for, and press the Generate button to get your Unlock Code.
10.Copy the generated Unlock Code to the Norton activation screen, then press the Next button.
11.Enjoy a fully unlocked copy, and naturally DO NOT register this software with Norton, you can now reconnect to the Internet.

If you have any other problems with any other products then please email me at Brandonlee_27@hotmail.com

,keepitlive,2008-04-29T08:27Z,"CanÂ´t comment on working or not LOL. As I have 2007 originally installed it actually blocks the keygen as a hacktool and only way to run this is obviously to disable any AV you might have running :) 

Anyway, just my 2 bits

/Keep"
,A-force,2008-07-17T19:43Z,"this the solution to norton products!!!!

1) install in trail version (15 days trail) NIS 2007 or other versions
2) when the install is done download the keygen EDGE and leave it in zip or rar IMPORTANT cuz symantec has keygens sorted as hacktools
3) disconnect the internet and set norton protect off!!!!! VERY IMPORTANT
4) unzip or unrar the EDGE keygen and put it wherever you want!!!
5) open EDGE and open norton protection center now go to norton internet security there is task and scans but just above that is ACTIVATE NOW click on that (STILL DISCONNECTED FROM THE INTERNET)
5) the phone option (everybody knows that one)
6) take EDGE product serial and past it in to the norton product serial
7) now you got a list of numbers in norton put those nr's in EDGE (optional years selection)
8) GENERATE put those nr's in norton and ACTIVE and your norton is active!!!!

X) dont do this in the old fasion way cuz it wont work this way it dose!!!
   Norton anti keygen will tell you its a HACKTOOL but its not turn off your AUTOPROTECTION and it works 
have fun with your norton now you hacked it your self for a little bit loooooooooooooool

greetzzzz A-force"
,jdmstar,2008-08-03T20:19Z,"This torrent doesnt work.

Even after downloading NIS 2007 and following both directions listed below, the activation would only work for 15 days and still wont let you go trhough live update and will keep on asking to activate.

EDGE KEYGEN NO WORK."
,kjackson,2008-10-16T03:54Z,"Worked for me.  Thanks!

I did a fresh install of NIS 2007 from a legit CD, entered the product key from my CD (although the one from the keygen should work fine), then used the keygen to generate an unlock code.  Activated for 10 years and ran LiveUpdate with no problem.

As others have noted, make sure you disable virus protection when running the keygen.  And make sure you're offline when attempting to activate - the option to activate by phone will appear after a couple failed attempts to find an internet connection."
,aborland,2008-10-22T23:13Z,"Ok guys, I had post this keygen for some time now that i even forgot...just came in to say that for those that were successful with this keygen well good for you and hey, i'm glad it worked out for you all.

For those of you who have had problems with it, hmmm, dunno what to say but sorry.  I guess the only thing that had left is for me to go install it myself for you.  I can only say good luck next time... as for me i am done with Norton for now.  I have found out that its not all that secure anymore as how i would want.  I use the simple AVG now and hey, been for over a year now without any viruses.

Thanks for the comment though."
