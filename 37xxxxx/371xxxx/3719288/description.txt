I had downloaded the NIS 2007 from herebut as u know it doesn't come with the keygen. Well i took time out to get it and now that i have it and most of u are requesting it here it is.  Problem is tho, that altho now i have both the NIS2007 Application and the Keygen, i still haven't been able to activate it. It doesn't pop up the phone activation option when offline like NAV2003-NA2007. For some reason it just wont. so maybe somebody might just be lucky enough to have it working.  So good luck and enjoy!
