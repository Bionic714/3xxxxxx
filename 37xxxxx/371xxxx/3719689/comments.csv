,rodgers82,2007-06-23T19:46Z,"Hi, 

This is a MMORPG BETA. It is free to play the beta (go to the official site to register), but I don't know if it is still going to be free or not when released. I personnaly Found this torrent dead at 5%.... but revived it with file I downloaded from official site because personnaly I prefer a torrent, and official site download speed isn't very good. 

I'll seed this file for 4 days. At the time of this post it is almost completely seeded once. Help me give that torrent some speed. 

Enjoy"
,MAZB,2007-06-23T23:45Z,"why the speed is so sloooooooooooooow, it is from 0.1 kb, to 8.8 kb, thats the max :("
,rodgers82,2007-06-25T19:32Z,"probably for one of the following reason

1. you are not connectable (you must configure router)
2. you do not send the file faster than you receive it
3. The maximum allowed connection is set real low

Using torrent, the download speed always match (or is beter) your upload speed if your settings are ok and if there is over 20 peers.  (unless you got a LOT of bandwidth"

,Orphaner,2009-11-14T06:52Z,"The actual client you can download from the links on the games websites are all corrupt, or something. I've gotten errors three times now, hoping this one will fix it. I'll seed it for awhile if anyone is still trying to get it. Only torrent I've seen with some seeders."
