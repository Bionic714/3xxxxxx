,darkgiant,2007-06-13T17:57Z,"you do realize the majority of this ""proper cookbook"" is made up bullshit that will most likely harm your self
and any and all hacking and phreaking techniques are outdated by a good 10-20 years? and no longer work"
,baker3video,2007-06-13T18:00Z,"yes i relize that, but hey i don't phreak so i dont care, ive done most of this stuff with the exception of phreaking"
,coolguy666,2007-06-13T18:01Z," I was wondering if the ""getting high"" recipes by using bananas and peanuts are real... :)"
,coolguy666,2007-06-13T18:02Z," Oh, what do you mean by ""proper"" btw? This book is available in many website, in several revisions. Are there proper and fake versions?"
,baker3video,2007-06-13T18:08Z,the proper version is what the file name said so i have no clue man i just downloaded it and it said proper
,baker3video,2007-06-13T18:09Z,and yes it will work
,Teh_Jawmht,2007-06-14T03:08Z,20Mb? it can be found anywhere else at about 3Mb!
,baker3video,2007-06-14T03:09Z,well hey get it somewhere else then at 3mb if you want but dont come crying to me that you want to save time and space by getting the 3 so shut up and download which one you want
,Evil_Communist,2007-09-07T22:34Z,"Thanks for the upload! I'll try to be a good boy, but it will be hard with this on my computer. "
,Jiisuki,2007-09-17T23:08Z,Proper is the name of a release group as far as I know.
,dudeinwonder,2008-01-21T20:53Z,"I've tried the peanut trick; I think it is like ecstasy (I had a strong urge to hug my brother), but I've never tried ecstasy. So yes, it works."
,Julian_Vamp,2008-04-28T01:39Z,"The banana peel one does not work, its been proven not to cause any form of effect. I don't know about the peanut one though O.o "
,lothainroxos,2008-08-20T07:03Z,"The ""Proper"" cookbook, is not on the internet, at least not the latest version due to unexpected problems."
,1337Gaara,2008-08-31T10:28Z,"Lol, if you want to get high Marijuana is MUCH easier and more effective (since the alternatives don't work). You can also eat Nutmug for a nice buzz (if you don't believe me google it or wiki Nutmeg). Mix some of that into a 7/11 Huge ICEE and it goes down easy. NOTE: If you use Nutmeg it takes about 6-7 hours to take effect... don't take too much or you will get pretty fucked up! On another note, a lot of these recipes are flawed; so use extreme caution to avoid blowing your hand off >.>..."
,Nicky.g.5864,2011-08-08T05:44Z,its called proper because there were fake anarchist cookbooks put out by the government in an attempt to stop or at least slow down anarchist activity. the instructions in the fake book will always fail. some just not working and others ending in total disaster.
