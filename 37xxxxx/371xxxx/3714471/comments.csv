,borov23,2009-01-15T00:32Z,I put up a bunch of Sole tracks on Demonoid. 42 tracks that are pretty hard to find from my own collection. Look it up in music as Sole (anticon). My user name there is also borov23.
,mister_yuck,2012-02-18T14:43Z,"oh yes. gooood music. and DO you have music for the advancement of hip hop? if you do i will make it worth your while to UL it if thats not an imposition. 

that cd, which at the time i had no idea was a sampler or w/e, was almost solely responsible for my getting into this - whatever you call it - underground hip hop i guess, and i held on to it for years and years but i've finally lost it after like 10-15 yrs of moving around. I guess it might be possible to track down the tracks individually but im hoping it doesnt come to that. anyhow i would greatly appreciate it.  thank you for this, and ostensibly, that."
