You should be thanked for this. Good work.

,Flanker15,2007-11-01T00:50Z,"Excellent collection hlt, only problem the game I want to play sooo bad (shattered steel) can't install properly or atleast I've forgotten how to do this right!  I can get some of the other games running but not that one."
,blemishednicely,2007-11-23T08:49Z,"is there any way you can put up Jagged Alliance: Deadly Games by itself? I'd really like it (I CRAVE IT),but mrtt's is the only standalone available, & I cannot coax it to run no matter what. To worsen, I only have a laptop & don't have room for a compilation/bundle (is there some way for me to take isolated parts of the bundle JUST for JA2?) Oh, and I'd like a cool mil., trophywife, car& beach-house if it's no bother, as well...."
,blemishednicely,2007-11-30T03:52Z,"Hmmm...either you're anti-social, no longer viewing this torrent, or that lame, shitty joke @ the end has kept you laughing so long you can't type an answer...which door will you choose?"

,Izule,2008-02-13T08:15Z,"Hey guys, umm I want to play the genewars game on this but I cant seem to get it to work any tips havent tried any of the other ones yet, so dont know if it is just it  not working or maybe me, I am using dosbox 0.72 and some old dos  games i dled worked on it but having trouble with this one"
,Izule,2008-02-13T16:39Z,"Well  tried another one umm Destruction derby and it worked fine so not to sure whats up, will try again later I guess"
,Blunted_Wizard_Asshole,2008-04-17T17:14Z,"u r the fuckin man
get bLuNtEd on me any place anytime"
,Duduzaum,2008-04-19T00:56Z,"Please, more Seeders and Leechers.
The download is stopped. Please let us help people.
Let's do ""The Pirate Bay"" but grow ever, and be the best of all. For that to happen, we must have good torrents to download and have good rates of Seeders / Leechers."
,blemishednicely,2008-08-14T08:58Z,"I got the entire set downloaded, but jagged alliance (which is the only one I've tried so far) seems to be a bugger to unpack-I've designated it to unpack to the C (letter) drive, but the unpack.exe, that weird msdos.exe & the dg.exe are all ther but just flash a quick black DOS screen & then shuts down auto. & does nothing...any ideas on how I can get it to run, or maybe a step-through? P.S. Gendre wars sounds kinda cool (if not suspect) & I'm totally trying that next. this collection looks dope."
,blemishednicely,2008-08-14T11:04Z,"I'm still stuck on running Jagged Alliance deadly games which really sucks as this seems to be the ONLY place I can find the damned thing. I manually unpacked EVERYTHING into my Cdrive/HDD, I even tried mounting it in ISOPro, and I also tried forcing it to run in the DOSbox, none of the DOS exe's seem to work except for the ""SOUNDSET.EXE"", all the others (including the UNPACK.EXE & the DG.EXE) just flash the DOSbox open and then it closes within seconds leaving absolutely no effect. On top of that these stupid titty-ads keep obscuring the advice you gave about the VM-ware and all that. How do you run this bitch? Not being rude, just really wanna play-still appreciate the collection...I'm currently trying to get I & II, so RSVP & rock it to the ground!!!"
,blemishednicely,2008-08-14T12:22Z,"I can't get these titty-ads out of the way to read what you are saying, AND I cannot seem to be able to run these...I've unpacked & played numerous game torrents before, but can't run this pack AT ALL-am I going senile? WTF? How do you get these fucking ads out of the way to read the damn advice? most of it gets cut off 3/4's of the way through...this sucks"
,blemishednicely,2008-08-16T07:44Z,"I managed to unpack Jagged Alliance, (had to MANUALLY pull each folder so I didn't get that ""needs volume RC_00"" to continue, etc.), and I even took a crash course in DOSBoxing & syntax, which was really fun (if you're an accountant), so now I REALLY wanna kill things and make 'em pay, but now every time I try to run the DG.EXE (in DOS), it tells me it can't open the file ""CD.ROM""...I changed it from ""CD.ROM"" to ""C"" (as ':' AND \ are not allowed in file names), but it refuses to run-am I completely not getting what you mean by ""Edit  CD.ROM so that the letter is your HDD""? I LOVE ALL the JA series (including Apeiron's ""New Jagged Union"", which caught a LOT of criticism-fuck those people), but have NEVER even played the original (as the Legendary ""Mike""), so I REALLY want to break this bitch open...What do I do about that Damn CD.ROM file? Please help, ANYONE!!! I MUST KILL AGAIN!!! Seriously, it'll keep me off the streets at night...so unsafe these days-"
,hlt,2008-11-05T17:07Z,"Seesh... to all you bitching mofo's:

[YELL]THESE ARE THE ORIGINAL FILES FROM BBS'S THAT DISTRIBUTED THE FILES BACK WHEN THEY WERE RELEASED.[/YELL]

Now, if you can not handle these old compression/split techniques that was used back then don't download. And, if there was a virus in the original release - there is a virus in this pack as well. Keeping the public with antivirus apps is not my responsibility.

Won't upload any more of these, problem solved."
