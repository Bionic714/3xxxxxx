,c0ldfusi0n,2007-07-05T00:31Z,I would watch out for this file. Not sure if it was just my area or ISP but i got a email letter about copyright infringement telling me to cease all sharing/uploading. It pointed out the tracker link from pirate bay. Just a heads up.

It's a great favour you are doing us. The things you have uploaded...I've never seen elsewhere. 
Great many thanks, and never mind the copyrights...! (The whole thing is illegal in a sense, but when governments kill and rob people it is legal).
Cheers."

Might have to re-listen at some stage as there's a lot I didn't retain due to doing activities while listening."

,Franoz,2008-10-19T08:31Z,"WAW, thank you for taking the time to upload & seed this. I just listened to the first 5 minutes and am already enjoying the first lecture very much. This is essential knowledge to share with every one. Thank you from France"
,IGotDMCA,2010-02-01T11:11Z,I strongly recommend people not share this. I got a DMCA letter from them. They will enforce protection of their copyrights. Their stuff is high quality but I chose to delete it all after I got the letter.
