This is a great local band out of Dickson TN. They have a kinda southern rock / country style. Check them out. It is only 17M and I am sure you will be glad you did. My two favorites are Southern Thing and All Hanked Up.

The newly revamped and rejuvenated Frank Pilgrim Band is Back In Business !!
A new web site is being constructed and will be up soon.
Frank took a year off and has found that special spark once again...better than ever and twice as hot!
Look out Nashville...the real deal is on the way.
