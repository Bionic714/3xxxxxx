,g8aso,2008-02-16T19:49Z,"24 comments and no hint as to encoding and bit rate?
The file sizes are so small it is almost certainly in 128 :-(. Not worth the bandwidth downloading it, what a shame."
,pirate_davy,2008-03-06T10:25Z,tnx much
,diamonddp,2008-03-12T05:02Z,"first off, awesome turrent, owe ya one hild, but seriously 3rd wave should be a 2nd torrent"
,dockular,2008-03-31T12:43Z,"1st and 2nd wave look great.  

Third wave is very unbalanced, with 8 tracks by commercial buck-o-nine and 1 skankin pickle track? 20 Bosstones tracks and no spring heeled jack, hippos, lets go bowling, pietasters?

11 Five Iron Frenzy (who I love) songs and no dropkick murpheys, slackers, blue meanies, mu330?

thanks for the work, though.  1st and 2nd wave really do look great. "
,dockular,2008-03-31T12:45Z,And no Voodoo Glow Skulls???
,zotrack,2008-05-01T20:54Z,...I agree that Voodoo Glow Skull and The Clash desserve a place... but I keep discovering a lot of great songs from the roots of the ska...  thanks for the torrent!

,3sheets,2008-11-20T07:36Z,"Nice find for this new Ska fan. I only checked the Ska Revival files so far, but they are mostly 128kbps, a few 192 and some 96kbps! Maybe due to source, I dunno.

Another clueless MF'er asking WTF are these 'padding"" files?  Been torrenting since the beginning and have never seen this!

Thanks for the up. Seeded to 145% back.
