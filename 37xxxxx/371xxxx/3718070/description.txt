Just a little EQ and volume boost and a cliiping fix during the explosion during Far Cry (which nearly scared me out of my skin!) ... no noise reduction.

Notes - This is my first Rush show taped... I think it turned out pretty darn good. Check it out! 

I started recording the intermission but decided not to complete it due to all of the talkers nearby and...nature was calling. I must remember NO BEER the next time I tape Rush (which will most likely be in Pittsburgh on June 25). Regretably, I turned my recorder off just seconds before the ending video. Otherwise this is the complete show and no breaks except for a fadeout/in after Dreamline and the 2nd video (the intermission I cut out).

PLEASE!!! Do NOT encode this to MP3 to share. It really cheapens all the hard work I put into this. 

I would like to thank Jack "Charley Brown" Walworth for assisting me with not getting caught by the gang at the SBD and as well as trying to keep some of the woo hoo'ers nearby a little quiet (as well as the clappers).
