,jgabriel,2007-06-11T17:34Z,"Never mind. Here's the info:

The Carry On's are quintessentially British in outlook and tone, with a reliance on bodily functions, female anatomy and double entendres that make the Farrelly Brothers 'comedies' look like models of restraint.

Looking back at the many ups and downs of the British Film Industry one clear period stands out as very firmly 'up'. This was during the reign of the 'Carry On' team at their peak. ... The team churned out a series of slickly produced genre parodies which, though often substituting authentic locations for a beach in Wales or a field in East Anglia, managed to upstage the Hollywood productions they were thumbing their noses at.

,billyboy1000,2007-07-14T20:18Z,"cheers uploader...

,monty64,2007-10-11T04:54Z,"Been looking for this for ages- cheers!
Seed!!!! (right now I'm the only one!)
Classic stuff- don't let this one die!"
,monty64,2007-10-14T04:45Z,"Been seeding solo for 3 days....
If you still want this, better start sharing kids...
I'm bailing... Upping 36 GB is enough...."
,hentooth,2007-11-10T21:14Z,"Kudos to U hazman, my kids wanted to see all the carry on films, and here they are.

Cheers mate :)

I will seed when done

18GB.. that could take a while to download, so if I get it all, I'll seed for ages, and my PC is on 24/7 so hopefully the torrent may just take hold"
[T],PracticingToublemaker,2007-11-21T19:52Z,I can't hear anything! Does anyone else have this problem?
,highlander777,2007-11-24T02:15Z,I have no audio either. I'm using VLC. Is there an audio codec I should use?
,freedumb2000,2007-12-05T15:12Z,Audio works fine here using VLC on the Mac. Only tried Carry on Camping.
,VillemoS,2007-12-20T21:47Z,"Been looking forever for this, downloaded for more than a week... and I can't seem to get it to work... please, please somebody help me!!
I've tried every Quicktime, VCL, DivX-player (I'm a Mac-user) and all I get is an errorcode that says the files are corrupt and can't be opened."
,hazman102,2007-12-27T00:46Z,"Hello the audio works fine even in windows media player but i recommend VLC i have never had a probem with audio before. I just opened the folder with them in and tried them and they seem to work fine with soud and everything!!!!!!!!
Not sure why they dont work run a hash check on the downloaded files to make sure they a fully complete or it may have troubles opening but see what happens sorry for your trouble!!!"
,VillemoS,2008-01-24T22:44Z,"i've got visual now... lower part very ""pixely"" but no sound except some ""screaky"" noises once in a while... 2nd download, ready to give up soon.
Any ideas?! Pretty Please! :)"
,hazman102,2008-01-29T19:55Z,Hey guys once again i read your no audio problems im sorry i really do not have  a clue it works fine for me all videos we need someone with so know how to enlighten us all!
,hazman102,2008-01-29T19:58Z,I just had a thought if you dont have divx codecs install them and if that doesnt work try getting an xvid codec
,markbloke,2008-02-16T11:58Z,"Seems to be a problem with the file index. Some players don't need the index, some do. The squeeking sound is actually racing ahead of vision because they're way out of sync. Repairing the index with Divfix makes it play ok on my XBMC but can't fast forward because the keyframes are missing. After fixing it throws up a certification error on Windows Media Player. I'll experiment with Virtual Dub and see if that helps. It'd be a shame if we couldn't fix this for everyone after hazman's hard work."
,nickfreestone1,2008-03-22T14:44Z,Worst download yet!  bits missing although showing complete! you need to re check the original! DO NOT DOWN LOAD waste of time!
,nickfreestone1,2008-03-22T14:58Z,hazman you need to force a re check from where you got your original download from. you had bits missing before you submitted your own upload! Force a recheck and re upload it! Good luck

,Xris22,2008-10-08T00:11Z,"All work fine for me.  Audio is good on all of them, though one or two have odd screen sizes.  They won't play in MPlayer but are okay in WMP.

,zoneone,2009-01-02T07:43Z,"I assume you still have exactly the same files that you put up here on TPB?
Then it's fairly simple, but it's done differently depending on what client you're using.

Basically:
1. Start downloading this torrent.
2. Stop the download.
3. Delete any files that have begun downloading.
4. Copy your own files into the same directory.*
5. Find the function in your client, to re-check your torrent (hash checksum).. and run it.
6. Wait for it to finish. (Will take some time with a torrent this big.)
7. If the check passes, start the torrent download again. Since you already have the files, it will just seed... just as you wanted.

* It might also be possible to change the download location to the directory where you already have your files... but since your torrent client might modify your files, it's of course safer to work with copies if you have room for them."
,shmollin,2009-01-19T10:19Z,"Wow what a great torrent, well done Hazman102 what we need is downloader?s to seed as soon as it has downloaded, and not disconnect as soon as they have it, that way more people will be able to get it. I will seed for as long as I can. Once again great up my friend   "

,traveling_east,2009-03-25T00:55Z,"The sound works great for some of the movies I watched. For some reason though, VLC media player will play the movies without sound. 
Use another player, I use KMPlayer. Thanks for the upload hazman."

YOU CAN ALSO TRY A PLAYER CALLED MPC STAR PLAYER. WHICH CAN BE DOWNLOADED FROM http://www.mpcstar.com/ FOR FREE. THIS COMES WITH ALL CODECS YOU NEED. SO THEN YOU WILL BE ABLE PLAY YOUR SUFF IN WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER (THE PPL WHO HAD TROUPLE PLAYING FILES IN WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER NO SOUND OR NO VIDEO ECT ECT) DOWNLOAD MPC STAR PLAYER THEN INSTALL IT

Then play file in windows media player

Hope this helps"
,mustafa-crap,2009-10-26T10:04Z,"Some of these files are corrupted. Repair them with

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3960617/Video_Fixer_3.23
