And why upload the same title twice; with different sizes ?"

,ripture,2007-06-14T06:58Z,Wow.  I was actually ready to give you the benefit of the doubt but I was mistaken.  You are a complete tool.  GTFO idiot.
,Robbycg,2007-06-17T05:29Z,"i zipped it because the rar process was taking forever and i was getting rushed.

I didn't upload the other one. somebody took this file and put it on other sites that I hadnt gotten around to uploading onto yet.

ripture - you're retarted"
,fire_breather,2007-12-04T22:21Z,The original question remains. Why zip an ISO file?
