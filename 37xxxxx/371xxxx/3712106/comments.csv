,malko050987,2007-06-12T17:18Z,"This is a piece of fanfiction written by Melindaleo, a popular Harry Potter fanfiction writer. You can find her on phoenixsong.net, where her other fics are stored as well. 

That said, you might as well read this. It's a very well written piece, especially for those that have enjoyed the romance in the Sixth Harry Potter book.

Compared to the other fakes floating around, this one is worth downloading. 

Don't know why the guy didn't just stick the pdf there, though. 

For those who have no idea what I'm talking about:

fanfiction = ?noun, Informal. fiction written by fans of a TV series, movie, etc., using existing characters and situations to develop new plots.

The page for the story that you can download above: http://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/story/3517/

It's called ""The Seventh Horcrux."" Enjoy :) And while you're at it, let the author know what you think of it. And read her other stories. "

,jedi007,2007-06-12T19:34Z,is this the real deal or not?
,malko050987,2007-06-13T11:04Z,"@jedi007:

Can't you read above? It's a fanfiction. It is VERY well written, though, so you won't lose anything by reading it. The real book won't be out for a few weeks yet. "
,Teh_Jawmht,2007-06-14T01:14Z,"@Canucks: No it would't you need to know your shit before you go around accusing people of uploading viruses. Assuming its uncompressed size is ~1.50Mb then there are 1,500,000 letters in it, lets say each word is 9 letters on average, there are 170000 word, if there are 250 words per page then there are 680 pages."
