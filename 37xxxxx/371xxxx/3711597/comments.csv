,HandyTricks,2007-06-17T19:19Z,"you can use your keyboard for these games! letters A, S, D. from what I no you can use any controller for the PC but must be programmed from the emulator."
,gamingmaniac,2007-06-18T21:00Z,"thanks for the download.
pls help me im a noob 
where do i get these games are they with the iso? i have nero so should i put the games with the iso where ever they are and then burn them with nero? 
I AM NOT SMART WITH GAME DOWNLOADS!!!! "
,HandyTricks,2007-06-18T22:27Z,"Use a program called 'ImgBurn' very easy to use, once installed you can right click the ISO File and 'Burn Using IMGBurn' this will open the program and just put a Blank CD in and BURN!!

download it here http://download.imgburn.com/SetupImgBurn_2.3.2.0.exe"

,mkrary,2008-05-16T08:31Z,"+1

you got everything under 1992(NO sega cd/saturn/dreamcast)

ends up to 32x

that explains how you manage to fix all this into 572.85 Mib

If you have played the MAME of altered beast, you be disappointed with genesis' version"
