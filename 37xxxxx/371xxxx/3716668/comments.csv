,npa2900,2007-06-18T01:20Z,Why is this password protected???And what is the fucking password????what is the point of putting password protection on the rar ?????
,npa2900,2007-06-18T01:33Z,"As far as i'm concerned if it's password protected then it's a fake as the uploader hasn't put the password out and the html link takes you to a site where it says....""to get password join here for free...blah,blah...bullshit etc..........."
,dangerdee,2007-06-18T10:00Z,password rar..hmmmm strange npa2900 click were you see Files:7(click 7)it will open the files do you see a rar or cant you read..pmsl
,Zerojohnnyx,2007-06-19T05:28Z,Well dangerdee at least we know that you are not a bot. You have defended your file several times. I'm going to download it myself & comment back again once I have looked through the file.
,VindictiveOne,2007-06-19T14:14Z,"don't ""bin"" file mean its only fit for a bin? forgive me if im being blonde here  just never found a bin file that will play.... will see in a few mins"
,dangerdee,2007-06-19T15:45Z,readthe NFo.open with note pad VindictiveOne shw you how 2 play and burn the bin and cue file
,Bandito77,2007-06-20T00:44Z,"VindictiveOne you probably just dont know how to run a .bin format file... there are plenty of ways including converting it to an iso and playing that way
just because its a .bin format doesnt me its not going to work... for this you could just use Daemon Tools and mount it to watch it (thats wut id do) especially because dangerdee says it has bin and cue format files
happy leaching"
,Zerojohnnyx,2007-06-20T04:19Z,Okay it's the full movie. The quality I would rate as a 7 out of ten. I'm sure one of a better quality might come in the future.
,dizsummergirl,2007-06-23T10:25Z,"I am dl this movie now. I have been checking

,anothergoofyone,2007-06-23T21:07Z,"ok, so the video plays fine using video lan, but when using Nero 7 to convert the file to dvd format there is a delay in the audio. This sucks, what the hell is the problem? Someone please respond."
,kudorgyozo,2007-06-24T18:20Z,"can someone seed this please...i only downloaded the sample so far and its good quality, so seed plz"
,kudorgyozo,2007-06-24T22:41Z,"i have some problems with this i cant mount it using daemon tools. it says ""unable to mount image invalid image file"" :( I had no problems with bin files before."
,kudorgyozo,2007-06-24T22:44Z,nevermind...i can open it with vlc player.
,kudorgyozo,2007-06-24T23:13Z,"now this is really weird...
