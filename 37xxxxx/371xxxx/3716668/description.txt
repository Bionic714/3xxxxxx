Plot Outline:
Everyone\'s favorite heroic foursome is back, but this time they\'re not the only super-powered beings on the block in director Tim Story\'s action-packed sequel to the 2005 hit Fantastic Four. The Silver Surfer has arrived on Earth to carry out his mission of destruction. When the havoc wrecked by the strange and shiny visitor catches the attention of four especially powerful Earth dwellers, the battle is on to save the planet from certain annihilation. Complicating matters, the group members suddenly begin exchanging superpowers after coming into contact with the mysterious surfer. Meanwhile, with his super-powered nemeses momentarily distracted, the nefarious Dr. Doom begins concocting a plan with the potential to overshadow even the Silver Surfer\'s destructive antics.
