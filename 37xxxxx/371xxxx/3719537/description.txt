Here's the full CD Image of the Just Flight/Aeroplane Heaven Spitfire.  It includes updates, upgrades, interactive manual, scenery, paint assistant and more.
Be sure to leave the CD mounted or loaded to install the extras and follow the read me in the extras file folder for details on installing.  There is a utility for the Duxford scenery for disabling as it may not be compatible with UK2000 Duxford airport.  It was incompatible for me so I just removed the scenery altogether as the  aircraft were 6 feet below grade and I use the better scenery from the Real Air Spitfire.
Put all 19 of the rar files in one folder and unRar to create the image file.
Thanks to B-52 as the source of this file. The download is approx. I Gb. 
Some aircraft are compatible with CFS2 and CFS3 and the installer will deal with that.

The most famous and charismatic fighter aircraft of all time takes command of the simulated skies in a definitive Spitfire expansion - Spitfire contains 39 aircraft that span 14 different marks of Supermarine?s legendary fighter. All models are FS2004/2002-compatible; five variants run with CFS3 and two with CFS2. Each variant has been thoroughly researched for authenticity and accuracy. Subtle differences between the various marks are modelled, including four separate styles of throttle quadrant, landing gear controls and other equipment. No two models are the same ? just like the real aircraft! This Spitfire package includes flight models, liveries, 2D cockpits, virtual cockpits, panels, sounds and instruments that are all reproduced to a phenomenal level of accuracy and authenticity. A bonus inclusion is period scenery of RAF Duxford.
