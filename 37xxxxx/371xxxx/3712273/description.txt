RedVex Diablo II Proxy
Version 2.5 by FooSoft
Update to 3 by Zoxc
----------------------

RedVex is a Diablo II proxy with plugin support. It supports plugins for all three
types of Diablo II servers (chat, realm, game). To add a plugin simply add it to 
the \"Plugins\" folder and it will be automatically loaded at application start. 
I have included all of the source code to RedVex and the plugins in the hope
that they will be useful to other developers.

Connecting to Battle.net through RedVex is easy:

	1) Select \"Edit | Options\" and pick the realm you wish to play on.
	2) Select \"Edit | Realms\" then add a new realm, I called mine RedVex (doesn\'t 
		matter though). Make sure it redirects to localhost. Pick the same
		value for offset as the realm you wish to play on.
	3) Select \"Proxy | Start\"
	4) Start Diablo II and pick the realm you added as the realm you wish to play on.
	5) You should now be able to connect and play using RedVex.
	
When using the plugin manager to unload/load plugins be carefull not doing that while Diablo II is running, it might lead to misfunctions and realm down. (Maybe even cd-key or account ban)

Optional command line arguments:
	-hide
		Doesn\'t show the main window when you start
	-run
		Autostart proxy upon launch
