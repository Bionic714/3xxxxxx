"The History Boys" - highly acclaimed movie adapted from the UK play of the same name. 

It's about a bunch of History students in an all-boys school under intensive training for Oxford or Cambridge. They're armed with a new "Originality over truth" History teacher and a General study teacher who likes to give them a motorcycle ride home and some touching in between. Need I say more ?  XD

My comment ? It's a great movie that'll leave your mind spinning for a while. And yes, underline "all boys". There are gay guys in the movie, a bit heterosexual relationship. No graphic though.

Oh and it's rated R in America and MA in Australia, but believe me, NOT because of the sex, 'coz there's none !! And no violence either  *snort*
