This collection has been put on the web for the sole purpose of distribution to the masses, what you currently find available is [the entheogen review] with compression as good as China is enviromentally friendly.

It's not the task of someone on a dialup modem to download a 500mb archive that when uncompressed is 3gig, especially if they only want a select issue, So the entire collection 1992-2007 is under 100mb, seperate files with a bonus acoustic guitar song that I'm sure you'll enjoy, and if you don't think you will, feel free to not download it.

The reason I say 1992-2007 is they're currently behind on publishing and these are the most up to date issues out so until next issue; enjoy !

The Entheogen Review is a quarterly publication that serves as a clearinghouse for current data about the use of visionary plants and drugs. All communications are kept in the strictest confidence--unless otherwise requested, published material is identified only by the author's initials and state of residence. The mailing list is not for sale, rent, or loan. Think of The Entheogen Review as a network newsletter; the voice of a community of subscribers seeking and sharing information on the cultivation, extraction, and ritual use of entheogens. Subjective results experienced by readers are published too. The Entheogen Review is dedicated to bringing you the latest, most accurate and novel data possible on these and related topics--information you cannot find anywhere else! Edited by David Aardvark and K. Trout.
