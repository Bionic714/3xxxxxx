This DVD was received from an anonymous fan without any info
about the lineage, but the quality of these rare TV archives
is superb! This is the very first time that the footage from
Samedi Et Compagnie and Forum Musiques surfaces, as well as
the 4th song the Floyd played at Bouton Rouge (Let There Be
More Light), making the Floyd performance from Bouton Rouge
available in its complete form, for the first time.

And even if the rest of the Bouton Rouge show, as well as
the live performances from Tous En Scene and Surprise Partie,
were available previously, they are presented here without
any logo, and with better video and audio quality than the
previous versions.

During the French spoken parts (band introductions and the
David Gilmour interview during Forum Musiques), English
sub-titles are available.

Last but not least, some extremely rare black & white promo
videos from that era are also included as bonus, even if
they are not mentioned in the artwork.


If your a pink floyd fan.................

Don't miss it, this is a MUST HAVE !
