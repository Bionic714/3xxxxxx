,chippxero,2007-06-22T17:43Z,"Boot to your recovery menu and make sure no-umd is disabled and put a UMD in your drive.

If it still doesn't work set your fake region to Japanese in the recovery menu.

please post once you have it working just so other people that might have the problem can see that it fixes it."
,jks10019,2007-06-22T18:30Z,"ok thx, going to try it out"
,jks10019,2007-06-22T18:43Z,"hehe, it didnt work, but thats just because of my UMD shuffle, its kinda broken xD"
