,dressmeups,2007-06-16T11:23Z,"Oh poor poor Portugese people, who cannot speak or understand English - they MUST have subs, since English is such a small and insignificant language, only spoken by a few people. The IQ-level of Portugal must be at the freezingpoint. ""Si, here is dis movi but I vill not download it since there is no Portugiiis subs"". Well, Hallefuckinglujah!"

,artaud2005,2008-10-17T03:24Z,"Does anyone know how many episodes are in this disc? It is one of six from the first season. If there are 22 episodes in a season, that must mean there are approximately three or four episodes. Yes?"
