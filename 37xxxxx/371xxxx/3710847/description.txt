Plot:
Glen Canyon, Arizona, the present day. Wayne, practising at night in the desert 
for his upcoming fireman's exam, witnesses the impact of a meteorite. The next 
day, biology teacher Dr. Ira Kane and geology teacher Harry Block from Glen 
Canyon Community College manage to get to the meteorite, which is stuck in the 
ground at the bottom of a cave. By taking a sample, they discover a slimy blue 
fluid coming out of the meteorite. A little later, Ira Kane finds out that 
myriads of single-celled life-forms dwell in the fluid, evolve at an incredible 
rate, even while he's watching. What first seems like a sure ticket to Sweden 
for the Nobel Prize soon develops into a nightmare: By evolving and adapting 
at that unbelievably fast rate, the Aliens start spreading out, and the 
Military comes in. Now it all comes down to what Darwin so rightfully stated: 
Survival of the fittest. And no good idea in sight...
