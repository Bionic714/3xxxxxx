Seeding 1 hour per day is a sign of lack of respect.. Also his Mainline tracker is a miserable piece of software.. Switch to something decent like Azureus.."

,dziban303,2007-06-29T06:07Z,83.3%. Argh. Seed immediately or a pox upon your family and damnation upon your soul.
,Salustius,2007-07-10T17:26Z,"This guy is probably an English guy living in Greece.

He seeds about half a hour per day. That makes him a sadistic bastard.

I'm afraid His skin is resistant to the pox. I recommend Scabies. Norwegian variety....

As for the soul he has none. He is now laughing at us and since most are at 99.2% and will probably will not seed the rest...."
