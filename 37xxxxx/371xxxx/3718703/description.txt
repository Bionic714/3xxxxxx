Brandy is all grown up and home from college.  Brandy's neighbor, Mr Thompson has a coming home surprise for her.  She can't wait.  Mr Thompson always made her feel special.  As a little girl  she affectionately called him uncle bill. She couldn't imagine what uncle Bills surprise could be.  She just couldn't wait.

Take care,
Enjoy,
