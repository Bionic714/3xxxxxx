The long awaited release of Katana's new album.

Imagine a rock band with one foot in the metal scene, one foot in the pop scene and two hands in the beloved hard rock scenes from the 70's, 80's and early 90's. Add to that a very heavy and modern sound image and what you will hear, see and feel is 100% KATANA.

This is their new album Heart of Tokyo.

01 - Heart of Tokyo
02 - When she calls my name
03 - Blindfolded
04 - Night avengers
