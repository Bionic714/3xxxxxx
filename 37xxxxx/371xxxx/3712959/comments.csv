Didn't Browse Language Packs though.."
,<<<[[[ --o-O-o-- ]]]>>>,2007-06-17T11:16Z,"Doesn´t seem to work:

""Setup cannot continue because a required file is either corrupted or not available. Run Setup again from the original source disc or download location""

Anyone had that aswell?"
,<<<[[[ --o-O-o-- ]]]>>>,2007-06-17T11:42Z,"Ok, here´s the deal.
If you run the image with daemon tools it works fine. Didn´t work when tried to install from burned CD. "
,wfgovie,2007-06-19T23:03Z,"No where does it say burn tested... I'm sure MagicISO or Alcohol 120 would help but why bother 
when it takes 2 seconds to mount install and store?"
,merdin,2007-07-10T11:58Z,does any one have communicator by itself? if so please upload and seed...
,jock,2007-08-28T21:23Z,"Can you browse the language pack, please?"
