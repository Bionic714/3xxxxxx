A small band that's located in Winnipeg Canada. It's a lot like Iron Maiden and has done some concerts with the Iron Maidens main singer. This discography has their two albums up to date: The Release and Centralia. Power Metal Christian. All the files are in mp3 format and are complete. Ripped and uploaded by Tsolless. Kudos.
