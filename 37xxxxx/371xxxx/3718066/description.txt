Absolute Non-mainstream #1

If you are like me, constantly looking for good music you never heard before, this torrent might be interresting to you.
Some of these tunes are really hard to find so I thought I'd share them, and if the demand exists I have material for more. As my sources vary so does the quality, but they are all atleast decent enough to listen to.

02. The Brooklyn Funk Essentials - I Got Cash
03. Joey DeLuxe - Itsy Bitsy
