I find this one difficult to describe, and to just copy and paste the Wikipedia entry would reveal the story to you. And that wouldn't be very nice.

It stars Thanos, and a much more complicated and emotional struggle between destroying the entire universe, and re-gifting the gift of life.

I'll soon upload Thanos's self-titled series.
You guessed it. It's called "THANOS."
