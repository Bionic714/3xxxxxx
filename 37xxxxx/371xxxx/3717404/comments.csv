,jilli_fixit,2008-05-07T05:49Z,Pls seed?  1st time doing this... I'm stuck at 96.6 %.  Any help is greatly appreciated!
,tjmicro,2009-02-25T19:50Z,"This movie was uploaded almost 2 years ago and there is no longer a seed available.  If you try to download it, you will notice that all the peers are stuck on 96.9%, forever.  It would be nice if someone reading this has the original seed to upload again."
,tjmicro,2009-03-16T03:34Z,"I've managed to get a full download of this movie from the ""Mrs. Miniver (W. Wyler, 1942) "" torrent.  It's the full English version with Spanish menus on the front of the movie, which you can strip off using ""Fab DVD"" before you burn to disk.  Another good Greer Garson (and Ronald Coleman) movie is ""Random Harvest"".  Can anyone suggest any other good old movies for me to download for my elderly parents to watch?"
