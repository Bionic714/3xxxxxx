Reading this on PDF is a pain in the ass.

Oh and thanks for the upload username, I just started buying the new ones, but I can't get myself to pay for the old ones."
,pwnguypwnguy,2007-06-29T03:01Z,Pleaaaaase seed people.
,INEEDASTUPIDUSERNAME,2007-06-30T14:36Z,"You're welcome W00DR0W.
Never heard of CDisplay.
I had a lot of the ""old"" ones 80's & early 90's but sold them when I was younger. I've started in the 80's again to refresh myself and am working my way up. I have the Ultimate X-Men and I'll see about uploading them this weekend."
,INEEDASTUPIDUSERNAME,2007-07-02T02:31Z,I just uploaded Ultimate.
,pwnguypwnguy,2007-07-02T21:23Z,Jesus fucking christ please seed.
,ws-rasmus,2007-07-19T13:50Z,"Really nice torrent, though I too prefer CDisplay to PDF. anyone know a torrent with X-men 200 (new) "
,businessman332211,2007-09-29T00:36Z,"Does this have ALL of them in read order.
Like all x-men comics even ultimate, new x-men, x-factor and everything.
Or is this mostly just the uncanny x-men run?"

,Wisuguysuya,2007-12-21T03:07Z,pdfs makes me sick...
,Capone421,2007-12-24T11:59Z,"Wow, truly amazing to read all the old comics i grew up with. Especially the 1978-1982 period. Great work making these pdf's, thanks"
,gagegecko,2008-03-08T04:57Z,You can convert the PDF's to CBZ's or CBR's pretty easily with Acrobat.
,CandiedHaggis,2008-04-14T10:59Z,"Thanks for your efforts, INEEDASTUPIDUSERNAME. I imagine it took you quite a while, good work.  That said, PDFs are a pain in the ass to read digital comics on.  If you have ever DLed a DCP or Minutemen pack, they are always in cbr or cbz format, read with cDisplay and some other programs (called sequential image viewers).
Those interested in converting, you can use the Pro version of Acrobat to export all the jpegs, zip or rar (archive) them and rename the extension to .cbz or .cbr respectively.  Also, theres an Open Source app called GhostScript which will also export jpegs from PDFs and a reader called ComicRack that will convert them, too.  That's a lot of work for 547 comics, though."
,Galactusface,2008-05-09T02:47Z,"Hey thanks for this!  I'm trying to export these to jpegs and it keeps asking for the ""file password"".  Can you help?"
,songsforbears,2008-05-26T23:26Z,"Thanks very much for this. For those of you saying ""Wow, great job compiling this,"" you should know that this is a title of software, not a user-complied collection. You can buy this at any software store."
,MFINN23,2009-04-05T07:12Z,"Holy crap man, thank you sooooo much for this you are a god!!"
,Zerojohnnyx,2009-09-15T04:44Z,"@ Galactusface. I've got the same problem. The files seem to be password encrypted. You can't alter them or try exporting them as jpegs ... aaannd no wonder why. songsforbears nailed it. Just realized , this is a software.

,phantocam,2011-09-19T05:55Z,"I just converted it to .cbrs, which are just rar-ed archives of jpegs.  Lots bigger, but no conversion to read on iPad.
