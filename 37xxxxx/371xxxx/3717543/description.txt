This is the leaked installation beta of Enemy Territory:Quake Wars Beta. But the beta hasnt gone live yet so you CANT play this yet, only install and launch the game and try the settings and such, you will need a BETA CD KEY once the beta goes live or maybe someone will figureout how to launch it.

Keep tracking nforce or theisonews forums or whatever.
