THE NO FLY LIST

As seen on '60 Minutes', aired June 10, 2007.



* Just how ironclad is the current 'No Fly List'? Are we more secure because of it? You may be startled to learn that this list is not as rugged as we've presumed. You may even find yourself muttering the words 'sloppy', or 'malarkey' while viewing this curious little nugget of 411. So sit back, top-up your mug of coffee, and have a subdued chuckle as these 20 minutes unravel the escalated frustrations of modern-day air-travel.

Enjoy, share!
