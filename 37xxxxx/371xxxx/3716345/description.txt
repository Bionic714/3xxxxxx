Beautiful artwork, wonderful voices for the animated characters by David Bowie, Madonna, Jimmy Fallon, Robert DeNiro, and Ron Crawford. Great to see an imaginative, kind child as hero, and see Mia Farrow act again. Arthur uses his love for his grandparents and his intelligence to persevere and save the day. (A treat for artists in the audience is grandpa's personal journal of watercolors and sketches at the beginning of the movie). The action really takes off once the movie transitions to animation, and perhaps moves too fast, although the children with me were able to follow it. The animated characters are adorable and even though they are very contemporary, and the movie takes place during the depression, kids will be able to relate to the animated fantasy characters - since they are fantasy characters, there is no reason they can't be contemporary. Overall a nice story for kids, with some good lessons for kids re: love, loyalty, perseverance, intelligence.
