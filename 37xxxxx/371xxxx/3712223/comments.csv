,*kris,2007-06-12T22:23Z,thanks for uploading some really interesting games.. appreciated!
,Chiva$,2007-06-12T22:46Z,"One of the best adventures i've ever played.
The game it's very unique, and i'm sure everyone will enjoy it.
Too pity it's not the ""Fahrenheit"" version (the EU) one that has some very interesting parts they censored on the american ""Indigo Prophecy"" version.
Still i recomend every gamer that hasn't tried thias yet to do so cause after all it's also a very good a small sized version by dopeman,you've done it again man;)"
,mikemn,2007-06-13T00:30Z,xp until i finish all these games i got which will be the rest of my life prolly. thank you dopeman
,m0ng00se,2007-06-13T00:54Z,"thanks again dopeman, love all your releases, just don't have enough time to play them all !

cheers"
,blood_and_bones,2007-06-13T22:15Z,"Cool, I saw the other torrents but they seemed to be the image of the game and seemed to have bad comments.  Would much rather download a dopeman RIP such as this one."
[T],Knaster,2007-06-13T22:21Z,Dopey is the man
,Zachriel,2007-06-14T11:04Z,"This game is great!

So the game actully feels like a movie ^^
Tnx again Dopeman, love ya"
,vamosamorir,2007-06-14T16:13Z,"Thanks dopeman, if god existed, he should be like you"
,Dupont60,2007-06-14T21:51Z,"This is great!
Thanks again Dopeman.

But I have a little problem with the game now.
I'm at chapter 3 or 4 and now te game crashes everytime I try to load it...
I get the ""loading""-page but nothing happens...
Anyone else having the same problem?
My computer is a brand new monster computer and I ran smoothly and excellent until now...

And, Dopeman, do you have any games with a more ""adult"" touch to it, if you know what I mean :o)

Peace and keep up the good work!"
,cbsius,2007-06-16T17:27Z,"Dupont60: Yeah, i have the same problem :'( Cant get past chapter 3 or 4, just gets stuck on loading screen, at the place the patch notes says. Almost made me cry lol, greatest game i've ever played, and cant even get near the end :/
The reason is known though, and there is a patch out there, but it doesnt seem to work with the pirate version... Perhaps we can persuade the dear dopeman to provide us with a patch that works with the pirate version? ;D Would save my day for sure :P"
,arowe17,2007-06-16T18:42Z,its a great game.. really intresting!!
,Zachriel,2007-06-16T18:53Z,"My computer is confusing me it can manage games as Rainbow six vegas and Medival 2 (which is great,GREAT games)
But this game totally laggs...
It bugs me but i have to live with it :D
Tnx Dopeman another great release.. Love ya"

[T],Knaster,2007-06-17T06:26Z,"one thing bugs me about thisone though, in the description it says ""uncensored version"" yet it is censored. The adult parts has been removed this i dont like!"
,antoni00,2007-06-17T15:09Z,game is good but when on a tyler mission in the beginning it just says loading and nothing happens :(
,vamosamorir,2007-06-17T16:34Z,"great game! i downloaded it without really knowing what i was downlading, and i had a surprise as i started playing the game,  loved it! Thanks again dopeman, you are the MAN"
,antoni00,2007-06-17T16:49Z,crap game that you cant complete!!!!! :@
,Samik,2007-06-17T20:47Z,"Dopeman, Please release a patch that works with this, I encountered a game crippling freeze that you cant get past and your version is unpatchable, thanks though."
,Samik,2007-06-17T20:50Z,"People, just a warning there are a couple of game freezes that stop your progress and cant be solved without patching and so far this version cannot be patched. I'd stay away for a bit. It annoyed the hell outta me."
,mattias_h91,2007-06-18T11:34Z,hope that you can upload a patch to this game as soon as possible.... 
[T],Knaster,2007-06-18T13:27Z,"Here is an uncensored european version which worked for me you can patch it too

,medieval_,2007-08-15T00:35Z,"This game is the american censcored version, and this version has a bug where you can't finish the game cause it lags a half of a second so you can't finish the level.. too bad"
,Soul_Traveller,2007-08-28T14:49Z,"Which level is it that has that glitch? I am stuck on the level with the cops and on the helicopter it keeps making me fall off, so I think that might be what you are talking about. I cannot apply any patches because the version I have is not the installable version :(

ANyone have a solution or know where I can download the installable version so I can apply the patch and finish the game?"
,kdm_montana,2007-09-07T11:15Z,"Dopeman u da best, i thought i had to search for this game, but i just came to TPB and it was there...GREAT!"

,Tr0llh4mm3r,2007-12-24T09:07Z,"Damn, just tonight I got to the helicopter part and it froze. Does anyone have a fix for it? I don't really want to download another release and have to beat the game all the way up to this point."
,gadgetdude,2008-01-01T03:03Z,This game is great but this version has some serious freeze problem. The patch1.1 solves the problems quite easily. I have found the patch that works this one from here http://files.filefront.com/Indigo+Prophecy+Patch+11rar/;8310339;;/fileinfo.html    and it works!! 
,MajorFluke,2008-01-22T17:46Z,"Everything worked great except the glitchy part when trying to hang on the helicopter, but I just downloaded a saved game to skip that part. Great download thanks dopeman!"

,kingbaldur,2008-03-03T22:55Z,"Can someone help me with this? I am extracting the file but it's just giving me a copy of the RAR file,no ISO,Please help.."
,Diceman_,2008-03-30T14:01Z,"I have bad freezing problems too, annoys me that the helicopter sequence is unpassable (despite playing around with all the settings on my computer I could think of) because of it.
Good game, good sized download for those with slower connections, wish Dopeman ripped the uncensored version instead. Reminds me of Japanese arcade games in the 80's and early 90's that had different graphics for the North American market, as if they're the most prudish region."
,Diceman_,2008-03-30T14:18Z,"Patch works great, thumbs down to Infogrames/Atari for releasing a game before they've got all the bugs sorted."
,cowcheese11,2008-04-17T04:36Z,"Hi, after I downloaded the torrent, I opened it and installed the exe. It made a desktop icon. The game played nicley but when I closed the game and tried opening it again, it says some error and says try to re-install it. How do I fix this problem? Thanks!"

,Geezguy,2008-06-22T16:00Z,"This game works. But how do I patch the game? When I try to install the patch it says that it's unable to located a certain file. I can find the file myself in the Indigo Prophecy folder, but the patch doesn't find it. What should I do?"
,Geezguy,2008-06-25T20:44Z,"never mind, fixed it :P"
,snake_is_solid,2008-07-13T06:32Z,Dopeman is the GOD of ripping! Good job man! Game works perfect though alot of the R-18 scenes are removed. Farenheit is still the better version. But hey who gives a crap good game and works perfect. It can even be patched. Recommended for download.

I really love the game and thnx for the upload, but i've come across a rather frustrating bug. I have come to the chapter when you run from the police in front of your appartment. I type all the keys in the correct order and my timing was perfect but when i have to hold on to the helicopter i have a small screen freeze and i drop no matter how fast i press A D (left and right arrows). And i can't pass this chapter cause of that, plz help me!"
,johnny_92,2009-06-16T12:58Z,"Nvm that, i found the solution (savegames lol)."
,camb31691,2009-06-23T07:53Z,"Wow thanks dopeman, works perfect. Though havent spent enough time for any game glitches yet.

If you like this game, make sure you look for Heavy, made by the same guys, and its the same style"

the patch that could solve the problem is now unavailable :( . it seems the new patch has been modified to break on pirated copies. 
can someone upload the old version of the patch ?"
,kutchbhi1,2009-07-14T21:19Z,"I figured it out! :) 

grab this and extract it in your indigo prophecy folder.

it will ask to replace 2 files . "
,Khunter12,2009-07-16T07:17Z,"@ baab32

I wasn't able to mop the floor in the beginning either, so I just skipped it. It doesn't make a difference though, the cops are still gonna come. Anyway, a pop-up said that the game stopped working when I was browsing the computer as Carla in her office. Now a few minutes in when I'm playing again, it does the same thing. Hopefully it works alright soon."
,Khunter12,2009-07-16T08:22Z,"Alright, seems to be in order so far."

,paladin181,2010-02-03T23:45Z,You can easily enable the adult/cut content by going into the game's ini and changing USmode from 1 to 0.

,ust2,2011-04-12T20:41Z," It works fine on Win7. 

 One down side is that this rip can't be patched, there is a v1.1 update that fixes a lot of freezing issues and some bugs, but oh well I havn't had any problems yet anyways.

 btw, you need a pretty good cpu still, every time a button secquence appears (which is alot, that is the core gameplay) it requires some hefty loading."
