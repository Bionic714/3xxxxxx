And concerning the size:  I don't know. I simply made my cd:s into iso-files. Perhaps others somehow reduce them, removing useless data. Srry, don't know.."

In the PAL regions (Europe, Australia and much of Africa), FF9 had copy protection and thus when you run it in an emulator, you will just get a black screen. There are two was to get this to work on an emulator. The first is to use Subchannel reading (which at the moment, for the life of me I can't get working), and the other is patching.
To use patching, first of all you need the PPF patch files. The ones for PAL/UK can be found here. Others can be found by searching google (the site which has them cannot be linked here for legal reasons). The PAL/UK patch covers all English language PAL versions.
All you need to do then is to extract the archive to the 'patches' subdirectory of ePSXe and enable 'Auto PPF-patching' within ePSXe  

Here's a direct link to the PAL/UK patch:

Thanks for the upload but seriously, if anyone could help seed this it would be great.  "
