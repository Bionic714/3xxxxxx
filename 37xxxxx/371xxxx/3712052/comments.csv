,v-max600,2008-02-11T01:58Z,When came goal 3?anyone who knows?
,WonderSlug,2008-02-22T01:10Z,"v-max, Goal III is still in post-production (final editing and such) and will be released later this year."
,WonderSlug,2008-02-22T01:12Z,"Bufu, these are VOB files.  That means to watch them, you'll do one of two things:

1.) Burn them straight to a DVD-R and play them as a normal DVD in any player.

2.) Use your PC's DVD player application (i.e. PowerDVD or WinDVD) and open them via that by way of changing the video ""source"" in those apps to point to the IFO file."
