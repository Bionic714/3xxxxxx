,Falleen_Fan_No_1,2008-03-04T17:18Z,"YES!  Zappa is amazing.  It should be noted however that this is mostly his rock stuff, and not his acid jazz.  Download Jazz from Hell for that."

,brutal_product,2011-07-12T09:42Z,Ekolb tyvm for your effort. But you all are cheating yourselves if you're listening to a 'best of' compilation of an artist that has literally 90% of 30+ years of live music recorded. torrent entire albums and listen in it's entirety! ..a little green rosetta...
,Relvin,2012-08-12T15:52Z,"I agree with brutal_product but, if you haven't heard Zappa before this is a good one to get introduced to him by. I recommend it and if you like it check some of the full albums out!"
