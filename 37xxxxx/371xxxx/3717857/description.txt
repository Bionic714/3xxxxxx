Although he was originally trained as a linguist, professor Noam Chomsky has become one of the country's most well-known academics for his harsh criticisms of American foreign policy. DISTORTED MORALITY - AMERICA'S WAR ON TERROR contains an unedited lecture delivered by Chomsky at Harvard University. Given in the period between the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the beginning of the Iraq War in March of 2003, the lecture focuses on the relationship between the United States and the Middle East, and Chomsky's controversial contention that America is the world's biggest endorser of state-sponsored terrorism. DISTORTED MORALITY presents Chomsky's views unedited, coming directly from the mouth of the famous intellectual.
