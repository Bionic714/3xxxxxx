First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.


Install those and report back!

KMPlayer to play HD from HDTV CHINA

If you download those 3 and install them all downloads from HDTV CHINA will work Have downloaded 40 and all works"

,gringr775,2008-02-10T15:53Z,how come EVERY one of hdtv china's releases stops at 99% or something? I'm getting sick of this site.
,DolphWulff,2008-04-16T21:21Z,"Hey you guys, just get CCCP (Combined Community Codec Pack), it's unintrusive and handles EVERY codec except RealMedia and QuickTime without hogging your computer with crap.

Anyways, that's not why I'm writing. First of all, thanks for this! Amazing! SUPERB QUALITY!

Second of all, have you guys noticed how the start of the movie has been changed? Originally, the movie was NOT called ""The Matrix"" as everyone called it anyways, it was simply called ""Matrix"". This always bugged me, when people added the ""The"" to the start of it. Check your old XviD or DivX version if you have one, and you'll notice the title scene does not have the ""The"" prepended. Guess they added it for some weird reason. Wonder why :)"
,aliasdavidoff,2008-06-11T23:19Z,"Sorry, but the title really is ""The Matrix"", not ""Matrix""..."
,stealthpancho,2008-07-31T20:16Z,"Can anybody post ""THE ANIMATRIX"" R1 NTSC DVD! PLEASE!!!!! I'm dieing here! PLEASE!!! THANK YOU!!!"

,Berserkr01,2009-12-10T13:20Z,Hello HDTV CHINA. I would be very grateful if you could upload the HD-DVD or the Blu-Ray of the 1966 movie Grand Prix (I live in Brazil and it's hard to find HD-DVD or BDs here). Thank you for your effort!
