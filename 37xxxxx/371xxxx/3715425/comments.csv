,Hanzodk,2007-06-16T10:36Z,"No need to scream. But I uploaded this, cause some guy asked for the mds file, and many people seem to have problem with this game. If I made a torrent  from a torrent file, it was  a mistake, cause the first torrent I made had the wrong tracker on it.

If you don't need or want this file, just don't snatch it and stop hating."

,Peracer,2007-06-16T20:00Z,Almost many has not updated to the 1.49 when I did it then the Dirt started running and ofcourde you need to have a good computer... as I had to get a new ATI Radeon to my Computer and else you need as the list above is made by Hanzok...
,Zmidponk,2007-06-17T01:59Z,"Thanks for that.

Had to actually go to the bother of obtaining Daemon Tools and installing it and using this in order to play my legally bought and paid for copy of this game, due to the fact Starfarce was telling me it had detected emulation software.

Slight case of irony there."
