Cut from the footage of over 100 media activists, This is What Democracy Looks Like
captures the 1999 WTO protests in Seattle.  The film marks a turning point in collaborative filmmaking and acheives a scope and vision possible only through the lenses of over 100 cameras.  With a driving soundtrack including Rage Against the Machine, DJ Shadow, and Anne Feeney, as well as narration by Susan Sarandon and Michael Franti, THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRACY LOOKS LIKE delivers an intensely political and emotional account of a week that changed the world.



At the WTO protests in Seattle, we had a collective vision.  We saw beyond the borders that divide us.  We saw people come together across every kind of political and cultural difference.  We saw peaceful protests shut down one of the most powerful institutions in the world.  We saw a system dazed and frightened by the sound of our voices.  "The documentary, like the protests, turns art into action"
~ Village Voice
