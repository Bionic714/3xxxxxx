Rik and Ade of course stars as the criminally insane no-hopers Richie and Eddie, 
who plan to save the world (and possibly destroy it trying) from a conflict much
bigger than a mere Gulf War; the fight between good and underpants. Edide has 
invented a time travelling toilet to help them alomg the way, but he is not feeling 
himself. If only he wouldnt get locked in it... He has all the weaponry, but is too 
stupid to use it, whilst Richie thinks its all a pleasant social event - hes quite
looking forward to feeling the sand between his toes. 

Rik says "You better bring some spare underwear! This time its death and destruction all the way. This is the big one."

Recorded at Southend┬┤s Cliffs Pavillion, Bottom: Weapons Grade Y-Fronts offers 
fans all the belching, vulgarities and knock-a-bout laughs they have come to expect
from these two psychopaths.
