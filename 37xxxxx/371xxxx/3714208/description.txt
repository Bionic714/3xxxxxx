Ryan Adams is one of my favorite contemporary songwriters, so it seemed only fair to post an album as soon as possible, for your listening pleasure.  He actually put out three - that's right, THREE - albums in 2005, I believe this one was the last.  It's actually pretty gross how prolific he is.  My songs usually gestate for a very long time before bubbling to the surface.

Hope you love him as much as I do!  Well, I love his music...we haven't actually met yet, but I'll let you know if things change.  Oh, and I also have a video of "Touch, Feel and Lose" as a favorite on YouTube, so if you hunt for my username there, you should find it no problem!

Peace,
