Name: Total Annihilation 3.1 Update, Extra Units, 5000 Unit Limit(used to be 200)

Ok so a couple days ago I uploaded Total Annihilation from my origonal game CDs...

 turns out some people want to download it... Its playable online multiplayer... so I found the latest 3.1 update put that in the file and some extra units.. along with the 5K Unit Limit... the game origonaly had like 200 limit which got boring REALLY REALLY fast...but yea not much.. Some of the extra Units include the Metroid guy ahha and Hello Kitty.. so fun.. to add them in the game just drag the files in the units folder into C:\Cavdog\Totalannihilation folder.. or where you have it downloaded to..

**NOTE**

Be carefull when updating and then patching over 5K crack... update to 3.1 first then do 5K patch.. that way you'll still be able to play online.. :0) have fun please leave comments and please seed 1/2 ratio so i don't black list ur ass!
