I think the tag line says it all: ""A prophetic video that explains why Israel is the key to world peace.""

In other words - religious propaganda for the weak of mind.

And now, in the blue corner, THE ISRRRRAAAEEEEL HATEEEERRRRSSS.
And in the red corner, THE PALEEEEEESTIIIINEEEE HATEEERRRRSSSS.

Let the comment bombing begin."

Video quality is excellent, with nice fotage of Israel.
NOTE - it may not play in WMP or RealPlayer, so you might need to revert to VLC Player!
Also, there is an 11 SECOND SYNC DELAY between visual and audio, but you can also fix this within VLC:
Go to TOOLS, THEN eXTENDED sETTINGS, THEN sync - AND CHANGE FROM 0s to 11000s (yes, 11 thousand!).
Enjoy the film"
