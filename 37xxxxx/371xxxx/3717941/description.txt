Syd / Pink Floyd OOPS (Out Of Phase Stereo) Mixes- These are fan-created remixes. These are NOT session outtakes. OOPS is a process by which a home user can remix a stereo track, thus revealing musical details that were less evident in the commercial mix. Depending on how the original track was put together, the differences may be subtle or dramatic, varying from song to song and in different parts of the song.

To better understand the OOPS effect, go here:

and then here:

This CD consists of nearly every available stereo Pink Floyd track Syd is either on or ever been rumored to be on. We left off "See Saw" and "Jugband Blues" because they wouldn't hold up to repeated listening. ("Jugband" whispers for most of the track, except for some of the Salvation Army band when the volume spikes. "See Saw" fades in and out with vocal and mellotron.)

This is the best of the Barrett solo material, as rendered into out-of-phase More tracks could be included, but the OOPS process didn't yield a particularly interesting mix, and considerations of space won out.

It goes without saying that acoustic songs could not be used. With nothing to work with beyond a guitar and a vocal, OOPS is beside the point. By necessity, this disc features Syd with a band, or at least some overdubs.

(CDs 9-10 feature a few single-channel mixes left over from CD8, noted as such. These are not OOPS mixes, but feature one channel of the original panned to stereo. A few of these tracks are good enough to stand alone as such, and so we present them this way.)

Every OOPS and mono track in HYGIY 8-10 has been rendered as a dual-signal expansion: one channel is a mirror image of the other. For the listener, this means a richer soundfield and a more natural ambience than could be expected from pure mono, yet without any obvious attempt at a stereo result from a mono source.
