,spadagoal_93,2007-06-18T05:48Z,yo subzero are there radiostations in this or have they been ripped out?
,MangeManneman,2007-06-18T08:27Z,"The Radiostations are there... located in the ""audio""-folder...  There are voices in the cutscenes and you can here when you change stations... but thatÂ´s as far as it goes.

Any ideas?"
,MangeManneman,2007-06-19T18:29Z,IÂ´ve got speech in the cutscenes... no radiostations however...

What's with the error?

NO AUDIOHARDWARE!"
,craigmc22,2007-11-10T03:55Z,"Its not a virus i think. It happened with me on San 
Andreas rip also. but i think its one of the ones u can ignore. still annoying though. Am i right at all?????"
,Traumzilla,2007-11-14T18:31Z,Can someone please seed this torrent? Im stuck below 1 kb/s constantly. This wont be done for days. No reason 249 mb should take this long. If it doesnt pick up soon Im just gonna cancel it. Please seed.
,Traumzilla,2007-11-14T22:26Z,"I was wondering if anyone had ever figured out the audio issue. I too am lacking the radio stations as well as speech during cut-scenes. Also, for anyone who isnt able to heal the trojan, you should type in AVG and download the free version. It detects and heals the trojan and now it is no longer a threat to my pc. I dont believe it was severely infectious anyway but for those of you who cant combat the trojan, you should use AVG. Let me know if anyone figures out the audio deal."
,TropicAkAmsRulez,2007-11-17T10:29Z,Seed ! 1kb/s !!!!

,Punkristo,2008-01-24T04:12Z,I installed it fine but I cant find the file to start the game ANYWHERE! i found where the sudio files are and all the folders but the EXE to start it isnt anywhere. PLEASE HELP!
[V],Subzero!,2008-01-30T02:41Z,"@all

Special Info Note:
###########

Some virus-scanner recognize the header of a 

packed .exe in this case my file called

 ""ToeD.exe"" as a lame virus, This happens 

because  its the byte by byte check error of 

em!,or in other words >your virustool is stupid< 

Its almost certainly a false positive alert from 

overly protective heuristics you can read more 

about in your VirusTool-Manual or

VirusTools-WebSite!.(category: heuristics).

>>>  thank you for reading.

,Diceman_,2008-04-16T13:24Z,"I get no audio on cutscenes, does anyone have a fix for this issue?"
,Diceman_,2008-04-16T14:12Z,"Looks like the cutscene audio was left out, I think this was a mistake as it adds a lot to the game. This version and the one by OdL_89 are suitable only for people who skip the cutscenes even if they have the full version, or the hearing impaired."
,dan3000,2008-04-30T17:32Z,anyone played this online?
,KakashiFNGRL,2008-05-01T14:22Z,"Again, i know i'm not the first person... but please!!! do something about the audio!!! it keeps nagging 'no audio hardware'... i realllllly like audio so please... edit the torrent somehow... or paste a torrent with just the working audio on here somewhere(?!)...

,xiIix,2008-10-19T04:16Z,I'm so sick of assholes saying that Toeds rips have viruses. They don't. It's a false positive due to over sensitive and paranoid heuristics. Toeds rips are CLEAN.

,NCPxdsw,2009-03-13T00:17Z,"I might just be a noob but none of the instructions you gave me worked at all and between that and AVG whineing about trojans every 3 seconds I just gave up. so if theres some magic step the you asume I know about, you should include it. like idk, what > game-install.bat < even means."
