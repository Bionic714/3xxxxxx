Description:
A Drum'n'Bass/IDM remix of The Line Begins to Blur, an idea that came to while listening to the original version while playing Wipeout Pure. Since the source sample have not been released by Trent (yet) the samples included are from the CD album release. All other sounds and manipluations are created by me (except the royalty-free percussion: kick, hi-hat, snare).

Songs that influenced this remix:

Aphex Twin - Vordhosbn and MtSaintMichelMix (and most other tracks from Druqks)
Fear Factory - Remanufacture (This remix was the sub-consious inspriation for the structure and sound of my mix)
Starseeds - Parallel Life (Aphrodite Mix) (example of a DnB remix that stays realatively true to the original)
Nine Inch Nails - All The Love in the World (awesome NIN song with a DnB feel)



For some reason, my piratebay account disappeared along with my torrents, so I'm resubmitting this one. Since teh FLAC version seemed to be more popular, I wont upload the MP3 version again, but it is still available at this page: http://www.jnftech.net/xai
