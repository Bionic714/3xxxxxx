or just type  slmgr.vbs -rearm  in the run field then you get 30 more days again, again and again :-)"

,Ravendownloader,2007-07-17T02:08Z,Ya I think you just burn the iso. What I will do is edit the iso so the crack is build into the iso and i'll make it so whenever you insert the disk it will activate windows. =)

,aljinn99,2007-07-24T04:13Z,"What are the steps in order to put it on a DVD, I mean do you copy the folder or the contents in it to the DVD?"
,Draconis.Pectus,2007-07-26T06:15Z,"Windows installs and works great, but I haven't gotten a crack to work yet. 

To aljinn99: 
Here's what I did: 
1) Extracted the files from the .iso file into a subdirectory.

2) Started MagicISO

3) Loaded boot image into MagicISO  (included in the torrent in [BOOT] subdirectory).

4) Loaded extracted files into MagicISO.

5) Created bootable .iso image.

6) Burned image to DVD.

MagicISO website has pretty good tutorials for doing the above steps.

Good luck!"

Can someone re-explain the steps for Magic ISO?"
,Amun83,2008-02-24T23:04Z,"To be more specific I get up to the point where windows starts to expand files and then it gives me an error message. Windows cannot install required files. The file may be corrupt or missing. Error code 0x80070017.

That was my third attempt to install it. My second attempt I got a random error code saying that it could not open the required files D:\sources\install.wim

I believe I got a different error the first time I tried to install windows vista ultimate."
