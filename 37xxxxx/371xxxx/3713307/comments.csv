,FSDude,2007-06-13T22:45Z,Excellent! Thank you!
,borak stiller,2007-06-14T01:08Z,"4X do you know if it contains SP1 which was an amazing 78Mb.?  As far as i can tell SP2 does not also include SP1.  SP1 was required for base files purchase befored Apr. 6 and my base file downloaded from here came sometime in March.  This statement from CLS regarding SP2.
""If you bought the product after 12 june 2007, you do not need to install SP1. It is included in the main installer. ""

Great uploadBTW and very kind of you to build in the update(s)."

,4X-AXG,2007-06-14T07:54Z,this rip was made from the latest installer which has both SPs implemented :)

,Panodilo,2007-06-14T15:43Z,Thanks for this! CLS are getting their shit together it seems. This is one of my favorite no-brainer addons.

Great, thank you."
,neslesman,2007-06-14T21:31Z,"HMMMMMM   40 downloads and no one has figured out that the textures are missing from the aircraft folders.

Could you post the texture files 4X?  Pretty please."
,FSDude,2007-06-14T22:41Z,That's probably because most of us have downloaded the liveries from the CLS website.
,neslesman,2007-06-14T23:33Z,"As Rosanna Rosanna Dana would say, ""Never Mind""
Sorry 4X I didn't look at the manual first so assumed the liveries were missing, as they are intended to be.  
But they can be downloaded from CLS"
