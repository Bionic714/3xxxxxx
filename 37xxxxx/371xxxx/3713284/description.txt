My first release is one of my favourite albums, () or "brackets" by Sigur Ros.
Ripped to musepack ~200 kbps.

arriving unnamed, icelandic group sigur ros's third album is instead represented by the graphic ( ). the latter's bracketed nothingness possibly implies a portal or an exit, which would make the entire record into a jumping off point for elsewhere. but gaze into it long enough, way beyond the initial snow blindness that sigur ros records always bring on, and it begins to assume the power of a scrying mirror in the mode of the obsidian oval owned by the elizabethan magus john dee. like dee's glass, you can lose yourself in ( ) for days soaking in the suggestive play of its shadows.
