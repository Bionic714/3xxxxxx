These are 2 DVDs containing about 40 mintues of live footage from Melt Banana's NYC Knitting Factory show that took place on June 10th 2007 as part of the Bambi's Dilemma tour.  

The video was taken close to the band from near the front of the stage so it can get really shaky (what do you expect from a video taken from inside a pit when Melt Banana is playing?), but the sound quality is quite decent and pretty consistent throughout.
