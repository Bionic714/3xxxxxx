Tänk på alla ""skräckisar"" som dom spyr ut nu förtiden-""Beverly Hills-90210 skräckisar"" kallar jag dom..shit vilket skräp!!
Ta o se denna i stället ungdomar!!!"

Maybe you mean. How much did you compress it?

It made the size 4500 mb and dvd shrink fixed the rest. 

Its really nice quality on the movie."
