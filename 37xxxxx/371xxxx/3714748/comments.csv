,funkfeelin,2008-03-28T08:46Z,None of these will open in CDisplay. It keeps saying archive broken.
,JessieEB79,2008-07-16T01:20Z,"Thanks!  I want to put up Nat Turner if I ever get a scanner.  It's too hard to find through comic book stores.  Besides, they messed that up and printed it on the wrong kind of paper.  Sounds weird, I know, unless you know the series."
,scratchbomber,2008-07-24T07:15Z,So.... is anybody gonna seed?  Purty pleaz?
,scratchbomber,2009-02-25T05:14Z,"hey hokierosa do you still have this?, i only need 5% .  i can seed it after that."
,hokierosa,2009-03-09T02:11Z,I don' t have it now. I wish I did. That computer bit the dust while seeding. 
,scratchbomber,2009-05-23T22:25Z,If anybody still has this could you seed it and help resurrect this torrent?
,hokierosa,2009-07-10T04:12Z,"There is another on the site now. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4949518/Kyle_Baker_Pack
