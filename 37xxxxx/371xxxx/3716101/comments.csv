,klemen912,2008-01-07T19:49Z,Thanks for the upload! This is one of the best games ever.

SimCity 4 was a terrible game.  just 'coz a game is old doesn't mean it's worse than a newer one."
,bigoltitties,2008-03-17T09:35Z,"Same problem as sepia678. Urban Renewal is all good, but it just quits out at the point where installation is required."
,bigoltitties,2008-03-17T09:36Z,"To clarify, the game itself quits out after the install prompt."

,prplxr,2012-05-22T17:34Z,@fernandopires: SimCity 2000 is by far the best of the games in the series. I don't care about graphics as long as the gameplay is this excellent!
