,BaMX,2008-04-06T04:34Z,How goods the quality on this movie
[T],wacko506,2008-04-07T18:20Z,it's prbably the best quality you can get without it being in HD
,Shadow_Jedi,2010-02-10T00:47Z,The quality is nice but the Swedish subs are 'HARD CODED.' I wish I would have known that prior to downloading. 
,Rakill,2011-01-24T21:24Z,"Yea, fuck, you should mention the swedish subs, I now see that you did in the 'texted languages' of your torrent but most people really just read the descriptions.

This is kindof a letdown because of the swedish subs, I won't be watching it so I won't be seeding it but thanks anyways."
,Teddikilla,2011-04-11T11:18Z,"Should have said that is was SweSub in the title. Then You would have saved people Alot of Grief. Thanks anyway, it would just help if you labeled shit correctly."
,EllipsisGH,2011-05-16T09:57Z,Almost every torrent of this movie has the stupid Swedish subs in it. Is everyone just passing around the same video and calling it their own or what?
,macsuper,2011-12-01T15:56Z,Almost only of the nordic people understand eachother. swedish language
