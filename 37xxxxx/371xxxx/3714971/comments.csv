,bob12357,2007-09-02T23:58Z,i downloaded this game but when i get to the comunication tower on the first disc in the exam after i leave the tower and run from that machine the screen just goes black and stays like that. Did i do something wrong?
,johnnyto13,2007-09-06T01:17Z,wat does .iso mean?
,bigjact,2007-09-16T07:31Z,.iso means that it is a CD image file. Using a program like Ultra Iso or Nero you'll burn a disc of the game. Or 4 discs in this case.

,meltlet,2008-01-24T01:10Z,Er....I downloaded it...and I extracted the files...but when I tried to extract CD 4 it didn't let me :S I actually own this game but it's on the other side of the world at the moment ^^;;
