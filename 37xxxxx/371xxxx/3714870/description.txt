Wow, some kinda of crazy stuff from Creatica first videoclip (1997).

A real and succesful clip well known among the artists of Bristol underground movement. With Adolf Hitler on voices. It includes the videoclip and the mp3 on high quality. Very rare.

Massive Blood Loss was awarded the Stardust Memories Palm to the best videoclip.
1 Award for performance excellence at the Advertising Cinema of Toronto (1998), also the European New Creatives Association prize and many, many others, besides making it on several tv ads and featured programs.

It also appeared on some independent movies like "Liquid Ice" and "Malevolenzza".
