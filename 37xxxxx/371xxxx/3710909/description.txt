In 1958, Cliff Richard burst on the British music scene as one of the U.K.'s first homegrown rock & roll singers. More than 30 years later, Richard was still one of England's best-loved pop stars, and in 1989 he sold out two concerts at London's Wembley Stadium -- the second show was added after the first sold out in less than three hours. 

'The Event' documents Cliff's triumphant headlining gig at Wembley Stadium in June 1989, which saw Cliff running through 31 tracks in front of an army of loyal fans (75,000 people each night).
