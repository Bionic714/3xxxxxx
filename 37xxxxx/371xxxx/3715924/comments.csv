If you call that ""educational"" then I truly feel sorry for you.

Ramtha is a 35000 year-old spirit-warrior who appeared in J.Z. Knight?s kitchen in Tacoma, Washington in 1977.

She used to sound like Apu from the Simpsons when she first started out. Once she found out that there are enough gullible people in this world that she can actually make a living off of this schtick, she changed the voice to the more refined version in this film.

Nice work if you can get it. LMAO!"
