:. about .:
 
Condor: The Competition Soaring Simulator is designed to recreate 
the ultimate experience of competition soaring on your PC. 

A lot of attention was put in to create an environment which would 
create an immersion of real competition flying. 

This means that the aerodynamics and weather physics were in focus 
of the development.

The result is amazingly real feel of flight in all flight regimes and weather
conditions which challenges a real soaring pilot on a competition day.
