,cicicoformaggio,2007-07-29T18:32Z,How this iso can be used?
,mrgoofy408,2007-08-21T06:24Z,I was able to download and burn the image using Nero.  I used a GQ 16x DVD-R media burning at 8x.  I got it to work on the third try when I inserted it in my Wii.  The only problem I have now is that the screen seems to get cut off at the top and bottom.  I have a widescreen plasma and I've changed the aspect ratio but it doesn't help.  Anyone else have this problem?  Anyone know how to fix it?
