,swtldee,2007-07-20T04:45Z,"It says this is english and spanish, nowhere in this could i find the english, for 4.2 gig and the slowest download in history, i'm not exactly happy"
,Dandelioness,2007-12-08T20:31Z,there is no Englise. do not download this unless you are spanish or speak the language!
,Ziiiiiiiiit,2007-12-09T09:27Z,so disappointing...I was looking forward watching this wonderful film but it's not that fun when the version you get is the spanish-speaking one!
,LadyLlama,2008-01-30T02:11Z,dammit i should have read the comments first before i wasted four days downloading it! the only english in this is the abba songs. was looking forward to watching this after many years since i last saw it. oh well. lets 
,razzma,2008-12-07T09:19Z,"There IS English. You have to select the English in your player or your remote, as it's not a choice on the menu."
,razzma,2008-12-07T09:22Z,"BTW, I specified it when I uploaded the torrent. 

Quote from the OP: (Subs can only be selected during reproduction with your DVD remote, not in the menu. Only Spanish subs are in the menu)."
,loosbroos,2009-01-02T21:15Z,"he's right !- it is in english - you just have to find it! ........select 'idiomas' in the main menu and then 'ingles (subtitulado)' and the movie will play in english (with castellano subtitles - just turn them off after the movie has started)
fantastic!"
,kdeub,2009-04-28T05:48Z,"perfect copy!!  again, will work in english, you just need to select it from the menu.  Thanks!!!"
,roborob3000,2009-07-30T12:55Z,Easiest thing to do is just strip the menu and foreign audio! Use clone dvd or dvd shrink (reauthor).
