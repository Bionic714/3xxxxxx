,AxelVanHorn,2008-07-23T21:22Z,"I have read a lot of stupid comment in my life,
Ianpb I give you the award of the PERSON with the LEAST MOVIE EDUCATION

STEVE MARTIN IS A GOD OF COMEDIE with only exception the Pink Panther he Wrote and Played wich was auful, just proved that Peter Selers was unique.

Anyway,
even great actors do mistakes (in this case he wrote it also)"
