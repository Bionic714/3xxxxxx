We just have some very disturbed youngsters who dosen't know whats yours or mine, and whos parrents need to kick thair fuckt up children in the head so that they will wake up and smell reallity! Maybe a haircut and a job would do it - or maybe just make it elligal to be a looser without a future and get paid to do drugs and burn down the nabourhood - cuz sadly thats a right we have in Denmark!"
,Raistlin (DK),2007-06-16T17:55Z,"Kill em all i say 

both our neonazi's and these youngsters :))"
,timov,2007-06-16T17:56Z,"wow! 500 sick bastards in one place , if i had a bomb! MOHAHAHA"
,cassebasse,2007-06-16T17:58Z,"I know, but not bad for one who hasn't been in class for 11 years, and dosn't use english everyday ;)"
,snikpeis,2007-06-16T18:02Z,"cessebasse talks about disturbed children, but sadly he cannot distinguish between ""disturbed"" and ""different from me"". you see, just because you don't have the capacity or the ability to see through your own (i'm taking a wild guess here:) self absorbing lifestyle, or whatever your problem might be, it doesn't mean that people with a different (and, i'm sure, very scary) way of life is disturbed. 
your ignorance saddens me. 
not all the user are violent, you know. most of them are just sick of modern societies lack of tolerance for alternative lifestyles, amongst other things. in many ways denmark has become more and more right-winged over the last few years, and you are pretty naive if you think that tearing down one of the strongest symbols of rebellious left-wing politics in all of scandinavia will pass without strong reactions and emotions.

,DirtyDawg,2007-06-16T18:15Z,"left and right extremist all suck ass
the riots call out the morons

come in to the 21 h century for fukk sake"
,cassebasse,2007-06-16T18:19Z,"snikpeis : First of all, my name is Cassebasse and not Cessebasse. Glad to see someone like you who is talking rather than troughing bricks! You are right about a lot of things, but when you on TV constantly is watching rock-throwing masked young people burning shit and cars in the street, you (that meens I) get just a little bit opsead! I don't know if you have children. I have and the oldest is turning 13 next time. I know my reaktion to theese 500 fuckheads maybe is a little hard, but the fear of my own chldren maybe shoosing that path is terrefying me, my family and even children (who has seen whats going on in TV) and therefore my armor and parades are up! And where is all this going when you also see the parrents of theese fuckups also are in the street DEFENDING their kids the right to throw rocks and desturb piece!"
,snikpeis,2007-06-16T18:21Z,"dirtydawg, and the 21st century is what, in your opinion? kind of sounds like you mean we should all just give up, follow orders and go with the flow, which again sound kind of dull."
,cassebasse,2007-06-16T18:45Z,DirtyDawg : YOU ARE SO RIGHT :) Maybee that snakepiss-gay shouldt learn a little from you. With that attitude we could end the middle-east conflict and bring Africa up to date. I'm with you.
,snikpeis,2007-06-16T18:46Z,"cassebasse, i obviously don't sympathize with people who would rather fight than straighten things out in a more constructive way. and i think i can understand your fear of having fighting and troublesome kids yourself. however, i don't think you should fear the ""organization"" itself, as most of the people are peaceful and harmless (although some look a bit weird). since i was never a regular user myself, i can not tell you what made people react the way they did, and all though i have no problem understanding their frustration, i don't think the violence made their case any stronger. the problem is very complex, and i don't think there is an easy solution to it."
,snikpeis,2007-06-16T18:50Z,"it is strange how a lot of right-winged people have such a simple answer to such complex problems. is that because of good thinking, or because of ignorance?"
,cassebasse,2007-06-16T19:01Z,"snikpeis: I'm just a ragular guy with an oppinion. I understand that you are 'colloured' by being one of the users of the late building (69 jagtvej) I'm sure you wasen't one of the riot-people, but I can no longer disguess this with you! You deserve to take this disguession with someone who matches you in the uppersid direction! I myself is right in the midle."
,cassebasse,2007-06-16T19:16Z,By the way. For all of you people out the who dosn't speek danish everyday :) The dirrect translated head title for this torrent is: 500 rockthrowing ultra-left-winged violentpsykos from hell.... (dokumentory-film about 500 Rockthrowing ultra-left-winged violentpsykos from hell)
,revoscout,2007-06-16T20:43Z,"to ratify a mistake this is not translated into ""500 rockthrowing ultra-left-winged violentpsykos from hell"" but to ""500 rock-throwing autonomous violence-psychopaths from hell"" referencing to a banner hanging from the house it self when it was sat to sale, it was done out of irony 'cause the place was called an eggshell for ""psychopaths"" who want another and more solidarity minded world. I my self am one of them, and I do not deny my share of militant actions, in my opinion it is not possible to use the parliament to get our ideas out. It happens on the street, on the internet, by mouth-to-mouth discussions (and not mouth-to-ass as it was with the politicians who where responsible for the eviction of the youthhouse)... The revolution happens from below and not on the shoulders of politicians but on the shoulders on us all!"
[T],Knaster,2007-06-16T23:34Z,Nästa gång något sånt här händer åker jag till Danmark för att knacka kommunistskallar!
,cassebasse,2007-06-17T00:15Z,"Knaster: Så meget svensk kan jeg dog til at smile :) Samtalen er længe nået under niveau, så bare ta broen over og flæk et pandeskaller på de satans røde svin ;)"
[T],Knaster,2007-06-17T06:48Z,japp någon måste ju göra det :)
,svineprygleren,2007-06-17T11:26Z,"Hold da kæft et forum. Cassebasse, knaster og den svans til Hunter, tag dog og opret et forum for jer selv og jeres slags. I kunne kalde det for ""ignorants.com"".
Vær dog for helvede lidt åbentsindede.
Peace"
,Raistlin (DK),2007-06-18T15:25Z,"DAMN didn't see all this motion coming just because of one small TV-program being uploaded :D

Well haven't got anymore 2 add, but muhahahah i actually find this debat funny :)"
,hc_junker,2007-07-21T19:05Z,kære revoscout har længe ledt efter denne film vil du gerne sende den tl mig bare skriv så sender jeg mailen du kan sende den til

,dedser,2008-03-10T12:33Z,"Cassebasee: ""We just have some very disturbed youngsters who dosen't know whats yours or mine, and whos parrents need to kick thair fuckt up children in the head so that they will wake up and smell reallity!"" Kinda funny considering you're stealing other peoples property yourself."
