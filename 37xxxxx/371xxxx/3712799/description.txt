The 2nd part of the freeware games collection. This time in this part:

Savage : Battle For Newerth + SFE Patch : One of the freeware games that make you wonder "Is This Really Freeware?????". This 3D Adventure online game is one of the best. It looks like something between Lineage II and FLYFF.

Pakoon : 3D driving simulation. You try to deliver pizzas with car or plane. Very funny ,though ,hard-to-control game.

LEGO Designer : Design a 3D Lego model and see how you can build it and how much it will cost.

The Universal : Another online multiplayer game. You travel in space but you can also land in planets that are owned by real players that build in them. Very realistic game. Has many extras (sucs as : LIVE radio, upgrades, chat etc.)

SNOK : The 3D version of the classical Snake game (Nokia cell phones have the classical 2D game).

And the best for the end :

Stunt Playground : 3D Stunt Driving simulator. Select the arena you want to play or make your own (!). Has many cars and many object to choose from.

Enjoy and don't forget to SEED. 

Thanks,
