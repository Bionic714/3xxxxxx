i'll seed for a while now too

but i have a problem, i unrared the archives and clicked on install.bat, once it finished installing it said press any key to exit so i did, and i clicked on pes.exe and it says i haven't installed it properly.
anysuggestions would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance"
,MrLavender,2009-06-16T01:01Z,"Thanks for the download, it works, but;

1. TR/IM.Agent.G.3 Trojan found in Incrediball The Seven Sapphires.rar (wasn't going to touch that crap anyway).

2. The _install.bat looks borked (setup.reg never gets run since it's mispelled as setup.req).

Manual setup:

a. Create a folder for the game, e.g. C:\Games\PES6\

b. Copy RFG_PES6.exe into that folder and run it to extract the game files (takes a while)

c. Open SETUP.REG in Notepad and change the line ""installdir""=""D:\\RFG_PES6\\"" to whatever folder you created in step a, e.g. ""installdir""=""C:\\Games\\PES6\\""

d. Save SETUP.REG, then double-click it to run it. Now the game is installed."
