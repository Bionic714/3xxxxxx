,orbitall,2008-04-20T10:22Z,"Yes, it doesn't work properly. Used 2 swf's for the test. The simpler one was converted to fla in a sec, another one, the bigger one, was paused during the processed and never finished. Do not rely on this decompiler.

BTW, there's an alternative solution if you desperately want to know what swf's contain on OSX:

Leech Parallels or VMWare Fusion, load up a virtual XP and then download SothinkSWF decompiler.
