TV COMMERCIAL POWER HOUR

A power hour made up of television commercials!  This includes many unintentionally hilarious local ads, some of the most famous commercials ever, foreign ads, and obscure old commercials.

This consists of sixty one-minute blocks of commercials (some are a little bit longer or shorter than a minute, but it all evens out in the end).  Sometimes I put two 30 second spots back-to-back, and there are also some 90 second, 45 second and 15 second commercials in the mix.

RULES: Every time you see the text come up on screen, drink a shot of beer!
