,skittleman12,2008-12-30T20:34Z,"When I try to open file is also says, FATAL ERROR: could not find The Sims data directory and also how do i replace original game?"
,swiftkick,2009-02-04T03:24Z,"OK so I haven't actually tried inputting the crack yet. But no virus' or anything of that sort. So everyone... my advice is get a better Anti-Virus program...

ANYWAYS...

To use the crack, you don't open the file...

Once downloaded, you go to the folder where the file was downloaded to... Got it?

THEN you COPY it from that folder & PASTE it into the folder that contains the Sims install files...

So if thats C:/Program Files/Maxis/TheSims, then you would PASTE it into C:/Program Files/Maxis/The Sims.

Not everyone's folder is the same, I'm just giving you a rough idea.

Good luck, I'm off to try the crack now."

xp antivirus 2008 is a virus lol.  It is one of those that pretends to be an antivirus and gives you tons of bogus reports. It infects your computer and then tries to get you to try to shell out real life money to get a better version to remove them.  Of course your just getting ripped off since it is all a virus and you risk your credit card info getting stolen. AVG on the other hand is a pretty well known anti-virus. While it could be false positive, I don't think I will take my chance with this one. "
