When I click Get Info on the .ico or .png file, it shows the Preview program icon instead of the actual icon. Therefore I cannot copy it and use it as Icon. Also if I open it in preview an then copy it, I lose the transparency. Do I need to convert them to another format? If yes with which program? Thanks"
,dr_kick,2007-07-16T03:12Z,Nevermind.... I used a program call Pic2Icon and it worked very well
