,golfpro,2007-06-21T21:50Z,Could the Uploader SEED their torrent please. I would imagine most people are stuck at 80%
,mundungous,2007-06-22T10:47Z,"Yup golfpro, I'm stuck at 81% too.
Seedy pleasy..."
,golfpro,2007-06-23T10:44Z,I've given up on this. Nones downloaded it in 2 days [its only 3MB for goodness sake] and the seeders obviously not seeding it. Well done Wwaalloo. Muppet. 
,benshi,2007-06-25T00:57Z,Downloaded fine for me. Just ignore the impatient youngsters . . .
,tannler,2007-08-06T17:37Z,Nema Problema - came down in a jiffy just seconds ago.
,Olive74,2007-08-13T02:37Z,"Why seed SN w/out DiskWarrior4 app ? I need both, only SN is useless 4 me. Moreover, I can find SN in SerialBox 4 free & instantaneously...
So could u seed the app plz ? THX ;)"
,ProjektEva,2007-11-01T01:05Z,"Works perfectly and really saved my behind as I had almost 490GB of data on an external hard drive that would have cost a fortune to replace. Serial number works just fine, and it works just like it should. Thanks!"
,toast100,2007-11-10T23:04Z,Cant seem to Boot from CD. Should i burn to a DVD or CD?
,swedishboy,2008-01-15T19:37Z,Obviously you can't boot of this one. This is for using on one mac fixing another mac using firewire target mode.
,graniteguy17,2008-05-28T05:40Z,"no, but you can definitely boot from an external hd to repair anything you want.  i just had it done at the apple store today.  great utility, great torrent - thank you."
,chuckcastle,2009-02-02T18:44Z,Works great.  Installed this app on one of my chop Macs and rebuilt client hard drives the same day!  Scanned with PAV 2009 on windows and found no infections.  Thanks Wwaalloo!
