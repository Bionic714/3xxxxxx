Well, this may not be such a known old adventure game, but I love it. Its dark, its sick and its well.. Just creepy hehe...

Ah, and this is an old DOS game, like everything else I've put up. :)


Next uploads will probably be Broken Sword 1 & 2, if not anyone here has a favorite old game they would like more...
