TRS-80 creates some of today's best electronic music. The Chicago trio (now based in Los Angeles) mixes up live drums, analog synths, and obscure and manipulated samples into a unique blend of electronic bliss. Demixes is comprised of remixed/demixed songs from their 2006 album Mystery Crash.

This release also employs the studio talents of electronic wiz kid John Talaga aka Fashion Flesh on tracks 5 - 9. Talaga is well known for building the electronic instruments he uses from scratch and has also created remixes for artists like Plaid, Cornelius, Momus, Of Montreal, and many others.
