,ArthurGoblin,2007-07-06T08:57Z,"PLEASE SEED THIS!

 ;)"
,ArthurGoblin,2007-07-07T12:39Z, If you are seeding this - please stay on until we complete the file! ;)
,jstranah,2007-07-07T23:42Z,"Don't worry -- I'm still seeding, albeit intermittantly, and will be doing so for a couple of weeks. Stick to yer guns, folks..."
,jstranah,2007-08-30T04:56Z,I'm not getting any help here. No one besides myself is seeding for more than a day or two. You guys need to get off your butts and start sharing. I'll stop seeding on the last day of August -- after that it's up to you.
,paraya,2007-11-21T00:23Z,I've downloaded 91.7%. But no one is seeding. I've been stuck for weeks. Help me out please
,VeritasReborn,2007-12-21T07:11Z,=I'll seed this when done (and I'm also seeding half Lustmord discog).
,Autobogg,2010-01-27T05:35Z,"Thanks again. Great music but it's not seeded enough to download completely. Those .wma files won't even play (and all incomplete music files can at least play what little is there as they are filling up). You should re-upload and seed. Why does the ""artist info"" have a link to some other ""Blue Thunder"" music? Not anything to do with the 1983 film. "
,Acisor,2011-05-25T08:31Z,Seed pleace :)!
