Although macs arent more expensive in comparison with not whitebox pcs. And you cant compare with whitebox pcs because the quality and technology. Is similar to compare the price of a laptop vs desktop.
I hope that some day we can find a mac original in a whitebox case but cant be in this time.
Although you can install osx in a normal pc machine.

(click on the left) http://www.osx86project.org/
to try... with 3d support games and compatibility although is faster and safe with a real experience.

You can find downloads about osx86 on this web"

LOL - just look at Apples Stock value and then maybe compare it a lil bit around ... maybe grow some balls and magically sprout a dick and perhaps you can start fucking your AMD machine :D Knock yourself out, dude lol"

,Sublime865,2009-11-26T07:18Z,"Macs suck, aside from being overpriced (you know how much that $300 ""upgrade"" on the cpu costs? part for part at retail, you went from a $119 chip to a $149 chip), they run no games and have no advantage over windows (graphic design? last I checked the CS4 our graphic design team uses runs Windows...). Reliability? Same parts as a beigebox. Why did everyone hate alienware? Because you pay for a logo. Atleast the logo worked, unlike another fruitcake called mac... I built my own for $1100, and its running two Radeon 4890s and a Phenom II X4 3.6GHz. How much for a crapple with that?"
