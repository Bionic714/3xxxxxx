Mac osx is not perfect but is nearer in comparison with windows.
Linux is cool but is more difficult to install new applications or find commercial applications. With vmware or parallels you can use those applications but with mac you can find tons of great commercial software even games. And now with the new Mac OSX Leopard is even better. You can find every reason to switch to mac, breaking the myths as that macs are incompatibles or that his cost is too much high or that they havent a lot of software and that is difficult to find through internet.
With all the new intel macs you can play in a windows xp virtual machine with quake4 in 1280x1024 very smooth. And natively can run windows vista 64 with directx10 and full 3d support as every normal pc. His OS is really solid as rock and his management is easiest of the market.
This video is funny too although is educative and have easy tutorials. Enjoy learning about macs.
