,peter7schmit,2008-01-22T17:16Z,"looks like you have to create the iso yourself. dont worry, its a peice-a-piss. ill let yous know about any virus'. thats if it downloads sometime this century."

,randomcakeman,2008-10-23T16:48Z,how to activate this every code says blah blah been used exceeded number of times being used.....  anyway round this or not?
,msd18,2008-11-04T22:33Z,yes there is a way around the code activation just call microsoft and say its the same computer ur reinstallin it on
,randomcakeman,2008-11-06T22:51Z,wont they know thats it a copy? though 
,rakzorzash,2009-01-14T06:56Z,"haha. Yeah, Microsoft is evil but they're not always stupid. They're going to get suspicious when a hundred people reinstall the same windows on the same box."
,eric1631000,2010-04-30T10:33Z,"seriously. The Product included isnt authorized. Also, the Product outside my computer activated and worked just fine. But One Question, Just like the Guy who Uploaded Call Of Duty 2 in .daa Format. Y dont you save us the Trouble and upload it in .iso Format. Plus i Tested This in Vmware Workstation to see if its activatedable. Its OPk but The cd-key is Rejected so Why go through the trouble of calling Microsoft to have them activated. The Product Key is Blacklisted. I checked when i signed in to Licence Labs. However I will Provide Keys That are a Gaurentee to work with Cracks or hassles. Just Let me Know. Finally This is The OEM version meaning the Product keys outside the System Unit Would Work If it Says Windows XP HOME Edition 1-2 CPU OEM. hahahahahahaha"
