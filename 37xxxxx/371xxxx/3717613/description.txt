Description:

"I wasn't sure about this going into it, or coming out of it for that matter, but this is watchable and is also rather creepy.

A legitimate sex change doctor, Leo Wollman, is our host and there's plenty of dialog and demonstrations and yes, even a bit of a real operation for your viewing unease, as a man becomes a woman.

There's lots of talk about the "third sex", people who are the opposite sex trapped in the body of their birth, and how unhappy they are/were, until they had this operation.

There are actually very few of these characters that look like what they're supposed to look like though. There's even some scenes of one "he-she" hooking in Central Park and bringing some guy home, even though apparently no "real" sex act was performed since the "john" may have noticed that this babe still had a penis. Probably every man's nightmare.

There's also a "re-enaction" of what happened when one man decided he couldn't take anymore, and needed the operation, but couldn't afford it, so decided to do it with a hammer and chisel, with, of course, predictable results, eyow.

This is not for the faint of heart or stomach, and is best viewed by those with a real appreciation for trash and the very strange. 10 out of 10, proceed with caution."

If that isn't an endorsement, I don't know what is...that and the fact that this is one of the few films that is BANNED in the UK, how can you NOT have it in your collection?!
