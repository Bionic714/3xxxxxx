- Release Notes
* Season Finale.
* 592x336 vs 624x352 from analog or dsr source
really makes no difference in quality.
* This can be considered lossless motion.
29.97fps is half motion when compared to the 
tv broadcast.
* Suggested player: VLC videolan.org
WMP is junk and will probably go out of sync
* Enjoy
