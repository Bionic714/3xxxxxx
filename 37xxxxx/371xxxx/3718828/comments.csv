All Kits can be cofigured with or w/out the close, overhead, and room mics.

Various combinations of kits , players, and effects are included.

If your computer has issues with playing some kits, load them in the MX configuration. This uses the least resources, but gives a bit less control."

,eloman101,2009-02-11T08:43Z,thank you so much. It is easier to use the 16-bit refill than the 24-bit refill. But i have one question. Is this reason drum kit refill 2.0 or the earlier version?
,Teh_Maestro,2009-08-11T23:27Z,"For some reason when I'm browsing this refill... every folder is empty besides the ""drum kit samples"" folder which has lots of samples but no organization... any ideas?"

Great up. Thanks."
