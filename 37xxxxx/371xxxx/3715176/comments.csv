,Dark-Core,2007-07-02T02:11Z,"Great Upload,  I Wanted To Watch Farscape When It Was On TV,  But Missed The First And Many Other Episodes And Probally Only Got To Watch About A Third Overall Spread Out Over The Four Seasons, Which Is A Shame Because From What I Saw Farscape Was A Really Original Exotic And Colourfull SciFi Story With Great Visuals So I'm Interested In This Download.

Just Curious Though,  What Kind Of Quality Are These?  As Filesize Seemingly Isn't Always A Good Indicator Of Actual Quality With People Encoding Shows With A MishMash Of Different Encoders And Encode Settings From Different Original Sources,  For Example I've Seen 40Min 700MBs's With Good Picture Quality But Drove Me Crazy Due To Bad Juddering/Missing Frames Despite Having A Good Machine Which Killed A Lot Of The Motion Quality And Gave Me A Bit Of A Headache Always Loosing Focus On Moving Objects Which Judder Across The Screen Rather Than Moving Smoothly.

And So Far I've Never Seen Any ""350MB Per Episode"" Or Even 700MB Per Ep Files That Equal The Image/Motion Quality I Get From The Basic Standard Definition Digital Broadcast Shown On A Decent Quality Midrange 42Inch TV Which I Find Really Strange.  

The TV Image May Not Be Really Sharp,  But It Isn't Bad For Standard Definition And Is Has No Noticeable Blocking Or Banding,  And Most Importantly The Motion Is Perfect,  Things Like Water Rippling Look Right And When The Camera View Moves Or Large Objects Move Across The Screen It Moves Fluidly Rather Than Jerkily So You Don't Loose Focus On Anything You're Looking At,  Even When Showing Non-Steady Cam Images Every Jerk And Wobble Is Shown Fluidly At I Guess About A Rock Steady 30ish Frames A Second.  

Almost Any Of The Above Motion Related Situations In Almost Any .Avi .Mkv ECT File I've Ever Played On Any Computer Seem To Suffer From Juddering And Jerkiness Or Blocking,  Are Most Non HD Computer Digital Video Files Generally Inferior To The Digital Video Files That Are Broadcast For SD Digital TV?  I Would Actually Love To Know What The Stream Resolution/FramesPerSecond/BitRate Is Of The Video That Is Broadcast On UK Digital TV,  Does Anyone Know?  If So Let Me Know Please ^_^

Anyway,  What Is The Quality Of These Farscape Episode Files In Image Quality And Motion Quality?  "

,seariverRJ,2007-12-24T13:46Z,I've been waiting a long time for the DVD-Rip of this great serie! Thanks a lot!
,monkist,2008-01-08T03:28Z,"damn leechers, your the reason why torrents dont download that fast, , take your heads outa your asses look at your computer and start seeding, 3kb's per second is garbage when i normaly download 200kb's"
,Cambranti,2008-03-09T14:23Z,Swesub included?
,katalyst01,2008-04-04T10:51Z,"Arg, don't bother downloading. It's only 512x384 res at 100%, full screen at 1200x800 you lose a lot of quality. THAT wouldn't be too bad if it didn't skip 30sec to 2min every 10min. I only got to the the 5th episode of the first season and I couldn't watch it anymore. You lose about 5-10min per episode and most of it is actual plot stuff. It's irritating. DON'T waste your time. Someone know of a rip or w/e that's actually worth downloading?"
,Zanzibarman,2008-10-17T07:45Z,"these files are 3 times the size of a Stargate Sg-1 torrent, and these videos are very good quality

so don't b!tch about them, if you want a good quality video, buy the DVDs"
,tp4000,2010-11-13T23:36Z,subs?
,ONeg,2011-02-16T19:06Z,"Garbage rip. First off was having to rename almost everything. Take a look at the file log. Completely unmanageable.

Where ever the 1st 3 season rips came from, they suck. I mean they look fine, but the codecs are screwy. You'll need VLC and they won't play on something like your Xbox 360.

Season 4 and Peacekeeper Wars are fine, decent quality and well labeled compared to the rest of the rips."
