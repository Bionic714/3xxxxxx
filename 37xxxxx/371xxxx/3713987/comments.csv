,death734,2007-06-14T20:46Z,is this the original mtv series from the 90's or the show he got after being canceled and replaced by andy dick for being way to stupid and going into a jewish temple as Hitler?
,Laseranders,2007-06-15T02:24Z,It's the one made in Canada before MTV picked it up. the New Tom Green Show sucked. This is awesome.
,Laseranders,2007-06-15T02:45Z,The jewish temple thing is a myth by the way. That never happened.
,agjdasgj,2007-06-28T18:28Z,Impossible to download when nobody seeds...
,Laseranders,2007-07-03T12:00Z,"jerekorva, yes, i think so.

agjdasg, i'm seeding as much as i can, I might turn off azureus from time to time though. Just wait and i'll seed again. I'm seeding at least til i have ratio of 50, probably more unless no one leeches so it feels pointless. I'd appreciate it if the rest of you try and seed as much as you can aswell."
,mysterie80,2007-09-22T21:17Z,"I was thinking of downloading this because I have never seen an entire episode of the canadian tom green show(I have seen clips here and there) but the seed to leech ratio is awful :(  also why is it that people are fans of the canadian show refer to the new tom green show as the mtv show, there was an mtv show before the new tom green show where they didn't try to make it a talk show that was actually funny."
