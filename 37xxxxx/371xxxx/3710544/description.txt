DEAR MUSIC LOVERS,

This mixed music cd is one of my MIXAMIX series.
This cds are made mainly as road music but some of them can be easily used for parties.
I make this cds to accompany me and my friends at car or excursions.

The motive for making these cds was the fact that I could not find a radio station 
playing the music I like without interuptions. So I started making my 1hour and a half music experience.
I like various kinds of music and like to hear them intermixed. That is a risk no radio station takes and also not many djs in the world. 
Till now only Paul Oakenfold , Daniel Davoli and a few more 
have managed to marry many kinds and ages of music together.

Anyways, hope you enjoy this mixed disks as much as I do.
Remember that I am not professional, I do this as a hobby.
The date after MIXAMIX is the date I have started creating each of this cds. 
The creation may take from just one day to many months.

A few words about MIXAMIX 20070512

	By the first moment I started making this mix I had this Summer in my mind.
Summer clubbing here in Greece means strong beats and balaeric sounds together.
Also year by year some tracks remain the same like they were writen for every Summer 
in our life.
So in this mix you will hear new tracks from Mika, Tiga, Global Deejays, Eric Prydz and more
mixed together with some all time classics and break beat sounds.
Also here u will hear some of the best remixes by Mikro.
Mikro is probably the most famous Elecro group in Greece. Have a look at the site: http://www.mikro.gr
and listen to their tracks. Keep an eye for their new album "Restart" coming out by the end of June.
For this mix I wont use the magic wand since there is no real remix to any track by me. However most tracks 
are intermixed in a way that gives a new sound to each of them. 

According to my friends this is one of my best mixes so I hope u will enjoy it also. 

You will need to overburn 1min and 3sec for this mix. 

	Keep sharing music and have fun!
