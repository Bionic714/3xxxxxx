,carbon787,2007-06-16T12:52Z,can i use this on a hdd
,Rayneman38,2007-06-17T05:35Z,Only you will know I have Swap Magic so I extracted and rebuilt it to suit Swap Magic usersotherwise it won't boot. This is as big as the game is the rest is garbage. The original image fills the entire disc like TMNT but it is only 1.26GB once rebuilt. My guess is yes it will boot on hdd....good luck!

,Sushini,2007-06-26T10:39Z,Hello. Great game. Do anybody know what to do when the message about the last licensedate has passed? Can I fix that? I'm halfway through the game. Pls help
,Rayneman38,2007-06-26T21:44Z,Is it something in the game because I haven't played it just tested it to see if it would work and it did. Are you referring to a glitch or are you just stuck and don't know what to do now. If that be the case you need to visit a game discussion forum or reburn this image at a slow speed. Good Luck! plz reply & explain.
,Rayneman38,2007-06-26T21:47Z,"Or you can reload from an earlier state in the game if you have more than one save, and what do you mean by license date passing?.....later"
,Sushini,2007-07-30T11:52Z,"no, I can't even start the game"
,quinie,2007-11-12T20:58Z,Where do I find a swap magic cd and dvd? It must be able to be downloaded from somewhere...??
