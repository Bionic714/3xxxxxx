:. about .:

The game's reception was less than overwhelming, but this isn't terribly
surprising. Rather than try to create a new game, Reality Bytes had 
pulled elements from several other titles (the real-time aspect of Ultima
Underworld, the theme of Doom, and so on) and blended them together 
with a few unique touches, such as the item finder that aided players in 
the discovery of(much-needed) powerups. 3 styles of combat  More than
30 weapons, including the vampire staff and the living flame More than 
30 enemies, including dark elves and undead knights Colored lighting 
Particle effects.
