It is strange that someone who is approaching a trial on
charges of child molestation should decide that an
appropriate title for their latest release is 'I'm A
Flirt', but R Kelly has never been one to go along with
the norm, rather choosing to subvert what is expected of
him through weird and wonderful behaviour such as his
extremely odd R'n'B 'opera', centring on cherry pie.

Peculiar? You got it in one. However, this is not to say
that R Kelly doesn't have talent - far from it, if it
wasn't for the rather more unsavoury aspects of his
character, he'd probably be doing really quite amazingly
well for himself.

'I'm A Flirt' is typical R Kelly, smooth and catchy, with
Kelly never slipping out of his swift, relaxed vocal into
anything more frantic. Everything is chilled out,
everything ever so measured. It's not quite the 'Ignition
Remix' but it's a funky enough song to catch onto the
imagination.
