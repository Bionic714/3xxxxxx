This is my first upload so bare with me.

Bad Boy Bubby is an uncompromising, Australian cult movie about the adventures of 'Bubby' a 35yr old man encountering the outside world for the first time after having spent his entire life locked up in a flat by his abusive mother. Bubby is a difficult film to describe being an erratic mixture of black comedy, tragedy and modern day adventure. Although hysterically funny in places the director likes to pull the rug from under your feet when its getting too much fun and let the mood of the film become much darker and more poignant. 

Memorable quotes:

-"Christ kid! Your a weirdo!"

-"Get off the road you fucking poofta bastard!"

-"Be still you little cunt or I'll beat you brainless!"

-"Hey son, you can call me Pop. I'm your Pop."
-"Hey Pop"
-"Hello son"
-"Hello Pop"
-Yeah, yeah, that'll do! Don't go making a big thing out of it. What's the matter with you son? Have you got a bit of a mental condition or something?"

This movie has no subtitles unfortunantly.
