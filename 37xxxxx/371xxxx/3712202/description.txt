This addon i have ready for sharing, too:

AES 1.7 with 26 working serials (over 200 credits)


I request:

A Better World for FSX
MegaSceneryX - Phoenix
Japan FS2004 (fsquality.com/Produkte/Japan.html)
Flight Deck 4 *working* for FSX

At least, a working serial for overland Japanese Airports Vol.5 (i have already a rip version, and a installer without key)

Note:
I will share the AES Keys, when someone other share:
A Better World, MegaSceneryX - Phoenix and Japan FS2004

The problem is:
The keys work since 1.6, 1.7 too, and when i share it the will be blacklistet next release. So i would like to have the addons, pls. Its retail stuff, with no copy protection. No problem to share!
