Bootleg CD of library music tracks and dialogue snippets from George A. Romero's classic original film "Night of the Living Dead."  Features an introduction and end commentary by horror movie maven John Carradine, as well as the audio from the original theatrical trailer.  

This CD was part of a limited bootleg release in the late 1990's, though the tracks seem to be identical to the Varese Sarabande release which is now out of print.
