,milo rambaldi,2007-06-16T16:09Z,"Extract the stuff. Run the file ""LiveXP.bat"" from the place where you extracted the files. Type in ""1"" and enter the path of the INSTALLDIR (eg. C:\Downloads\Windows.XP.USB.St... Press enter. Then type in 2, press enter, and then type the location of your USB Drive. Press enter and after a few minutes the installation is then finished. Now go to your BIOS screen by pressing Del when your computer starts and change the BOOT sequence. Removable Drive or something like that must be on the top of the list. Save Changes and Exit. Next time you boot your computer with the USB stick present in the USB port, you will be taken to the pen drive windows Vista edition"

,charliepan,2007-07-17T17:14Z,"I'm very curious... gonna try it.

,slidfis,2007-07-24T00:02Z,Seems like a classic trojan setup. Uploader and one a bit too helpful associate. 
,xaiprojectcstatic,2007-08-03T00:43Z,"""ericcarr that was the xp Edition. the is the vista Edition""

Yeah, because it's just the XP edition packed twice in one archive"
,eggysplat,2008-01-21T03:32Z,""" ""ericcarr that was the xp Edition. the is the vista Edition""

I thought this comment was a comical joke at first... just looked at the download and, indeed the archive contains 2 folders: 

Vista (usb)
Vista usb

Both of which have the identical BartPE XP USB Edition.

Waste of time!"

Your flash drive needs to be plugged in with the Vista OS running.
Go to the command prompt and type ""diskpart"".
Type ""list disk"" to find your flash drive.
select disk 1 (assuming disk 1 was listed as the jump drive.)
clean
create partition primary
select partition 1
active
format fs=fat32
assign
exit
