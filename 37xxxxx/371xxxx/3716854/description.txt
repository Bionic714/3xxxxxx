I, Videogame Episode 5

The advent of the internet has changed everything ? including videogames. 
When ARPNET, a military precursor to the internet, went live in 1969, gamers almost immediately began using this new technology for gaming. 
But what began as text-based adventure games called MUDs (multi-user dungeons) quickly evolved into graphic-based online adventure games called MMOs (massively multi-player online games). 
Millions worldwide have battled together and against one another in the latest genre of videogame. 
From Ultima Online to the most successful MMO of all time, World of Warcraft, gamers now are attracted to virtual second lives as they battle friends and foes across the globe from the safety of their home computers. 
In the virtual world, gamers have found they can be anyone or anything. 
The ability to reinvent oneself virtually has become an irresistible experience for many, and has some critics wondering whether the line between the real world and the virtual world has become dangerously blurred. 
Many gamers spend more time in the virtual world than the real world, but they argue that the virtual experiences of MMOs are still human experiences simply delivered via the latest wave of technology ? the videogame. 
This episode includes interviews with Cory Ondrejka (Chief Technology Officer at Linden Lab) and Richard Bartle (British writer and game researcher best known for being the co-author of MUD)
