In the window ""Setup needs the next disk"" during install, I am pointing to the ""sassetup1cd"" folder on my C: drive (where there is one file in the folder, the config xml file). Is this correct, or should I be pointing elsewhere? The install comes back to me with an invalid path msg.

I think we need to download another version of this."
,caffeine1,2007-10-12T06:28Z,"The sid.txt file that comes with this torrent appears to be invalid.

This download is useless without it.

I think future downloaders should STAY AWAY from this torrent.  You won't be able to install the software."
