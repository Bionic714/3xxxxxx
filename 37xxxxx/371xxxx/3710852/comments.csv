They don't make 'em like this anymore....thank God. Probably one of the DULLEST shooters I've played in recent memory. Nice Texture work but thats about the only upside to this piece of shit."

,denizen23,2007-07-31T17:15Z,"The game is far from being a piece of shit,  but it's obvious there are plenty of brutalized retards playing the game.  You're not having fun with this game because its artistic qualities completely elude you.   Unfortunately for you,  It takes a SOUL to enjoy a well rendered experience.   If yours is too vegetative to feel subtle things just STFU and go jerkoff 
playing some superficial console game."
