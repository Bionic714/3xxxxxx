,jake198456,2008-01-01T18:04Z,"Don't download this shit...if this guy's amazing attitude didn't tip you off, the very suspicious message you get when you run the program should give you a second clue: (it says something like: ""SiD installed, etc. etc. "")

Then there is a ton of little scene-proggies, one of which shows him flipping you off and saying how much he hates you.  At the end, all I had was a few directories with no files in them and almost nothing related to star wars battlefront at all. "

I love the compression on this damn thing 2gb down to 200mb

why doesn't every torrent use that :)

also Jesus h Christ i nearly shat myself when i ran the 2eyed.exe and it popped up

Anyway Instructions are simple
1: Run Star Wars Battlefront.part1
2: Run Star-Game
3: right click tecsetup.exe (Set to compatibility for windows 98)
4: Continue on with star-game
5: Open GameData
6: Play
