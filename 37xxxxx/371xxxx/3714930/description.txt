When Mutya Buena, the 22-year-old from Kingsbury, north-west London left the
Sugababes, she was leaving more than a Triple Platinum pop group with an
international fanbase and a healthy haul of awards. She was leaving a life she had
known, in one form or another, since she'd been eleven years old.
'Real Girl', the debut solo album from Mutya follows the single of the same name that
features a sample from Lenny Kravitz's global chart-topper 'It Ain't Over 'Til It's
Over'. The album also includes collaborations with timeless voice George Michael
(whose only previous female collaborators were Aretha Franklin and Mary J Blige, so
she's in good soul-girl company!), Brit Award winner Amy Winehouse on 'B-Boy Baby'
(which samples The Ronettes' 'Be My Baby') and Groove Armada- whose partnership on
'Song 4 Mutya (Out Of COntrol)' will be Mutya's second single and is already being
heralded as a monster hit by NME and Pop Justice.
