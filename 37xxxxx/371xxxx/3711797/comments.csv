,Raistlin (DK),2007-06-13T20:50Z,Well then just_another_fiddler what do i get if i really really want to download these PAR2 files?
,just_another_fiddler,2007-07-10T10:08Z,"PAR2 are parity files. You can fix a corrupt download with them. They're commonly used on Usenet when data is missing or corrupted on nntp servers. You can reconstruct a limited portion of the originals, or fix file corruption, with them. Usenet works like peer to peer, except with servers instead of clients. Servers with problems, such as a bad router, tend to corrupt posts as they pass them around the world but missing articles are the most common problem. If you take just the very smallest PAR2 file here you can use it to check the download, similar to SFV. But if the download is corrupt it will tell you how many PAR2 blocks you need to fix it, so you wouldn't necessarily need to get all of the PAR2 files.

Why I included them? Well, if no one is seeding the vid files, and say you're stuck at 90% but you can get the PAR2 files (I posted 10% PAR2), then you could take those and reconstruct the missing parts of the vid file no matter where in the vid file the data is incomplete. They're almost magic! With 10% of them you can reconstruct any 10% anywhere in a file! They're the best thing since sliced bread. If you got the vid complete then you don't need to download them but, like I said, if you just grab the real tiny PAR2 file you can check the download with it for piece of mind.

,just_another_fiddler,2007-07-10T10:12Z,"Well, that's what you get it you ""really want to download them"" but the reason I mentioned them in the first place was because I saw many IP's grabbing the PAR2 and not the actual vid file too. They'd have been really disappointed with the results so I wanted to warn folks in advance."
