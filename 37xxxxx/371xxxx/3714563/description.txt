Nite Versions by Soulwax.
Ripped to musepack, 200kbps.

Soulwax always seem to take two steps ahead on the music scene and their new album Nite Version is no exception to this statement. Nite Version contains some tracks that may sound familiar to clubbers. The Nite Version of "E-Talking" (one of the biggest club hits of 2004) and the kawasaki dub of "NY Lipps" stand among new tracks such as "Another Excuse" (A Collaboration with DFA) and their cover of Daft Punk?s "Teachers". From Electro to Techo, from bombastic rock to disco, this record guarantees to keep you moving. The Album is mixed by de Dewaele Brothers (Soulwax/2 many DJ's).
