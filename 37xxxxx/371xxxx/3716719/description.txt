:. about .:

The plot of the game unfolds during the period of July 1942 - January 1943
and tells the story of one of the most dramatic episodes of World War II. 

Featuring two detailed campaigns, the game will let the player take command 
over Wehrmacht and lead the German forces into the city, then switch to the
Red Army and liberate the Soviet stronghold from the occupants and obliterate
the 6th Army under the command of Gen. Paulus. 

In contrast to many other RTS games out there, each mission in Great Battles of 
World War II: Stalingrad is created with historical authenticity in mind and with
reference to the actual place and time to real events that took place during the war.
Besides, the missions are created in such a way that campaigns give an authentic 
picture of events at the theatre of war operations.
