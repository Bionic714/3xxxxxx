[T],despo1ler,2009-08-02T14:46Z,"I was looking forward to playing this after having the demo previously but I'm afraid I just can't trust it with my AV software telling me there are 4 different trojans in it, I'm used to keygens or cracks showing as a trojan but it is also the exe file and the installer in this 1 Maybe there is nothing wrong with it and it is just the way it has been repacked in a new installer  but I don't know enough about trojans to say they if they are harmless or not so I'm just gong to have to give this 1 a miss, any1 else who is worried by their AV results should probably do the same and try and find a different copy. Better to be safe than sorry, I've had to format my hard drives and completely reinstall windows before because I ignored a virus warning on an exe file so I'm not taking that chance again :("
