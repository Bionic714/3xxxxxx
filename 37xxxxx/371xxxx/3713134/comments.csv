If I were in their place I'd get out too while the idiots of my country have fun blowing themselves up and killing everyone that is apposed to their ideals.  The US isn't to blame for their towers being blown up, the Iraqi people aren't to be blamed for Saddam killing them because they are of a different party or have differing views of Islam.  Yes indeed we have WofMD.  They are used for defense.  Japan bombed us first remember - Pearl Harbor - enough was enough and boom the message was sent don't mess with our defense. I Totally support Israel having WMD's also because look how they are surrounded by millions of Jew  hating Muslims.  Go Isreal go.  Don't try to use the Bible as a defense to your words because it supports the cause of both the US and Israel as NATIONS.  You say that oh my the US is an occupying force why can't we blow them up?  Do you feel its ok to take out innocent children along the way?  In your statement you seemed to care so much about the women and children!!  Make up your mind suicide bomber. "
