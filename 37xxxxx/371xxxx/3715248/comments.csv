,ineffiable,2007-06-16T23:29Z,"Gamespot says this is an expansion to CFS3, but we don't need the original CFS3 to play this do we?"
,balkandain,2007-06-17T18:15Z,"""This version game contains of course the original CFS3 Battle for Europe,
But also integrated is the expansion pack 'FIREPOWER""

You guys should read more ;)"
,ulumutu,2007-06-19T18:03Z,"Hey Dopeman, enjoying your great work.

I'd like to ask if you could head over to the mininova forum and then to the > Torrents chat > Games > Problems & Questions Section.

Theres a thread about your Two Worlds release.
People would like to know whether they should wait or not.
Just to straighten things out :)"
,igortrx,2007-06-20T18:25Z,sorry dopeman but this game kinda sucks :/
,Zachriel,2007-07-11T09:46Z,"If you liked this im sure u gona like Aces High 2

Btw thx Dopeman great release..."
,opus12,2007-07-15T13:23Z,"Wow, I've been looking for this since the release, more or less.

Hated CFS3 but heard good things about this.

If u like ww2 sims and dont play IL-2 Sturmovik:1946, youre crazy btw. =)"
,pman2323,2007-07-21T00:52Z,"Ok, if any of you out there are using vista, you need to do this one extra step. After you extract the file with winrar, drag the extracted file to C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games. This should fix some problems you might have when you start the game up. Im using vista ultimate X86 Build 6000 on a 32 Bit processor. This game is pretty good, especially with the firepower add-on. Enjoy."

,anothergoofyone,2008-01-08T23:03Z,"hey dopeman, thanks for the file. I actually went into best buy and bought the game and remembered i used this site :) I see everyone having trouble starting this file as I was until I figured out what to do. This should solve all the starting issues. After downloading AND SEEDING.  Here is a Tip. USING WINDOWS XP  i rar'd the file using winRAR, then took the extracted folder called ""combat flight"" i moved the folder and all of its contents to my C drive and program files folder.  HERE ARE THE STEPS, EXTRACT THE FILE CALLED COMBAT FLIGHT 7 ZIP, THEN A FOLDER CALLED COMBAT FLIGHT APPEARS. MOVE THE FOLDER TO YOUR PROGRAM FILES FOLDER, THIS IS FOUND IN C DRIVE THEN IN PROGRAM FILES. ONCE THE FOLDER IS IN THE PROGRAM FILES FOLDER LOOK FOR THE THE ICON THAT IS CFS3CONFIG AND RUN IT. ONCE FINISHED RUN THE FILE THAT IS CFS3 LOGO USUALLY A START LOGO. RIGHT CLICK THE LOGO AND SEND IT TO THE DESK TOP USING A SHORT CUT.  ONCE THIS SHORTCUT IS THERE YOU CAN START THE GAME EASILY AND EFFORTLESSLY!  THANKS DOPEMAN YOUR THE BEST!!!"

2. Does this game support a mulitplayer network and if so does it work safely on this torrent?
Thanks all and especially to the uploader :)"

i downloaded this and got files containing disc 1 and disc 2 with .cue and .bin inside
i used damon to mount first one and it set up the game, disc 2 finished the setup
then i did the reg setup too
but when i try to run the exe, i says that it requires a disk, i try mounting each of the disc but it says they are wrong


help.... please?"
,swordofray,2008-10-18T16:58Z,"nvm about my previous comment by im really confused
are you supposed to mount it then set it up, or copy files to c drive?
and where am i supposed to find CFS3.7z???

please help, thanks!"
,Sk1ppr,2008-10-25T14:45Z,"@swordofray

I think you might be posting in the comments for the wrong torrent. There are no bi/cue files in this one, just a .7z file to unzip with latest WinRAR or 7-zip, the .nfo file and a URL shortcut. You don't install anything.. just unzip.. double-click the reg file and play.

I haven't been able to get this to run in Vista 64-bit, but noticed as I was uninstalling that not all the registry keys merged properly, (HKCU worked but HKLM was missing) so I'll have to try again later. If not can someone recommend something more recent?"
