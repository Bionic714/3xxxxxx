,beverlydt,2007-06-14T13:57Z,"Can someone plz reseed this with other shareware games, I'd hate to see this game fade away into the ages"
,Jfloeck3,2012-05-15T04:57Z,This game is a classic! I remember playing this as a kid... if you pay attention to the storyline it is probably one of the best stories i have ever read in a classic video game. Well hey if anyone wants this game just comment and I will try to seed as much as I can when I actually manage to download the game.
,Jfloeck3,2012-05-15T04:58Z,But yeah I can't actually dl it because there is not enough seeders.
