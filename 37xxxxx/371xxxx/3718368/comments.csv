,longlivetheking,2007-06-19T20:38Z,Imas li kojim slucajem nase titlove za ovo?
,vedran,2007-06-19T20:47Z,nope. =/
,Painanator,2007-06-25T07:45Z,plz seed
,vedran,2007-06-25T17:16Z,"did you think i would upload a torrent and not seed it to 2 availability? please avoid any further ""seed plz"" comments.. the torrent is huge, and my bandwidth is small, as is your patience.."
,urosbez,2007-07-11T09:12Z,"Great torrent. Vedran, when I get 100% I'll take over the seeding for a long time. Just be patient and seed until I get it all."
,Painanator,2007-07-17T15:17Z,"Well my patience is great trust me, and that comment made i when the download were at a stand still for 5 days. my intention wasnt to annoy you so for that i apologize."
,vedran,2007-07-17T21:26Z,"most of the people could get this at a rental shop and rip it, ridding themselves of this pain. that's the recommended solution, actually.
but for those that live far from ""developed"" (underdeveloped, as our descendants shall witness) countries, and really can't or those who are just not in the mood, there's the torrent.. regarding the speed, i'll do my best, which is not much, i admit... after all, it's not me who pays the internet bill. :/

Painanator, thanks for sincerity. all is well.. =)"
,urosbez,2007-07-29T09:32Z,"Look i'm stuck at 40% for 10 days now. So if you intend to seed it, let us know. If not, let us know just as well because in that case we're wasting time and energy. Thank you for your answer. Because unfortunately in many countries La Femme is not yet available in DVD-rentals."
,vedran,2007-08-02T13:08Z,"i was in the mountains for the past week, so that's it. i'm seeding it now.. sorry"
,karantanec,2007-08-02T14:48Z,No problem...just seed now please...i love u coz u UL that (:
,glr,2007-08-10T18:05Z,"After the first 40% (I got season 1 & 2 in almost 100%) it slows down, so everyone that has 3 and 4 please try to seed even if you normally wouldn't.

I got season 5 from a single torrent."
,rarashannon,2007-08-10T19:51Z,Forgive my lack of computer intelligence but I keep seeing messages everywhere about 'seeding'. I realize that the more 'seeders' the faster the download but my question is this;  How do you seed and what exactly is seeding? 
,glr,2007-08-11T21:25Z,"Seeding is basically uploading data.

You can seed while your downloading. If I give uTorrent my entire connection it will download at ~800 kB/s and upload at ~50 kB/s, meaning while I'm ""leeching"" I'm also ""seeding"" as much as I can.

Once you have all the files on your harddrive you can also start the torrent, then you won't be downloading anything merely uploading to others, thus not leeching, only seeding.

1 Seeder and 28 Leechers means there's 1 person who has all the files and is only uploading, the 28 are downloading and hopefully uploading at the same time."
,zvitig,2007-08-25T21:17Z,"Vedran,
If you intend to seed it, let us know. Just seed now please."
,karantanec,2007-09-02T11:31Z,can u seed please...im on 55%...when im on 100% i will take seeding...just seed till than...
,cristoslc,2007-09-17T21:50Z,can whoever is seeding please post what hours (GMT) they're usually on? I'm in GMT-5 and can't get past 57%
,vedran,2007-09-19T09:01Z,"i'm usually seeding anytime between 08:00 an 22:00 GMT..
that's ANYtime, not ALL the time..."
,hoycegracie2k,2007-10-05T21:38Z,Is someone seeding this still? Looks like there are 50 peers all of whom have no more than 65%.
,norm441,2007-10-23T23:57Z,"Last week I downloaded Season 5 from another source. When I determined that it was identical to the Season 5 in this torrent I renamed the files to match this torrent. I copied the files into the directory for Season 5, ran the torrent recheck in Azureus and when it passed I let it seed. That got us up to 68.4%.

Over the weekend I found Seasons 3 and 4 that are also identical. I did the same procedure as I did with Season 5 and now those files are seeding. I can only seed at 70KB so it will take about 45 hours to get to 99.9%.

Vedran: We still need the 3 sub-title blocks to reach 100%."
,karantanec,2007-10-24T17:28Z,tnx norm441 i love u :)
,karantanec,2007-10-27T17:44Z,"wel im on 92,8% ;D"
,karantanec,2007-10-29T22:28Z,vedran seed that we come on 100%!!
,glr,2007-10-30T00:04Z,"I did the same as norm did with Season 5 about a month ago, that got us over the 40% hill. Now I see a lot of people going to 99.9%, I dont think we will have 100% because Season 5 Ep 1 and Ep 8 are missing 2mb and ~0.5mb... but you can still watch em! Anyways, good work everyone gettin this torrent to stay alive! 195 peers at this moment!"
,vedran,2007-11-02T14:23Z,phew.
,karantanec,2007-11-02T21:10Z,""" vedran at 2007-11-02 14:23 CET:
phew.""
vedran u are fking noob! "
,vedran,2007-11-03T09:03Z,you're welcome! =)
,fa81,2007-11-03T18:37Z,"i've been looking for this a looong time
i just say... thnx a lot vedran :)

btw, does someone gets the message: ""connection closed by peer""?  I do from yesterday and my download speed has reduced to 10-20%  :'(

Is the tracker working right?"
,fa81,2007-11-04T21:40Z,"nvm, tracker is working fine today :D"
,redhammer,2007-11-13T14:36Z,"Before you even touch this, take a look at vedrans other releases, like Close Combat series.  Theres a ton of people having problems with that, and none of us can get 3 of the games in the series working and Vedran doesnt even answer how to get cc5 or cc1 competently working, to NEITHER of the people in those 2 pages of comments. ""Theres a short guide for XP compatibility for cc1 somewhere out there...  OK vedran,  where? LOL ive had cc1 for years and never gotten it working on XP no matter how much I troubleshoot online or by my own..  cis errors are irrelevant??  Not all of us wants to install Alcohol 120 just to get our computers ruined cuz of it..  Seriously Vedran, get ur other downloads WORKING first."
,baby1730,2007-11-13T21:51Z,*bangs head on computer* omfg this is taking forever to download.i have been at it for days.surely there is a way this can go faster.iam sure iam not the only one who is frustrated :(
,baby1730,2007-11-13T21:55Z,if i ever get all of this downloaded i will seed.i just wander if this guy knows what he is doing ffs.i have never had so much trouble downloading something :(
,fa81,2007-11-15T00:27Z,"*bangs head on computer* omfg this is taking forever to download.i have been at it for days.surely there is a way this can go faster.iam sure iam not the only one who is frustrated :( 

when i said ""thnx a lot"" a meant thnx for uploading this torrent. i've never seen all 5 seasons available anywhere else.  

But baby1730, you are right, totally right.  When everyone got 99.99% i was able to download at 90 kB/s (that's fine for my download speed (130kB/s max)).  But when everyone got 100% completed, my download speed was going at 5 or 10 kB/s.  2 days ago, it has been better, 20kb/s as mean :S  My PC is online 23 hours a day, I got 65.5% of files, and 2 weeks online.  OMG...

frustrated...

i just hope ppl here get a ratio of 1.000 at least.  After I get 100%, I will be seeding to get a radio of 1.5.  So, I leave 1 copy and a half for ppl.  Anyone who is reading this and agrees, DO THE SAME PLS.  For all of us.  We've been here for a long time, and more for those who needs this torrent.

Greetting!  And be generous as many here will be!"
,baby1730,2007-11-15T05:32Z,iam not trying to be bitchy iam just frustrated.i do appriciate people who take the time to upload videos.i always seed whatever i download.i love this show and i have been at it for a couple of weeks trying to download and it gets dishearting because it seems like it will never finish.but like i said if i ever get it all done LOL i will be seeding back.thanks to all the peeps who are giving back and not just taking :)
,kwikkwekkwak,2007-12-17T18:18Z,Thanx a lot! Will be seeding 1:1
,LuxZg,2007-12-18T15:17Z,"I've just finished downloading complete pack after less than 11 days. Since there isn't many seeders I'm glad it took only that long :)

It looks fine as much as I've tried watching, and I can only say THANKS both to vedran and to EVERYONE THAT'S SEEDING!

I'll leave it seeding for a while, didn't set a ratio limit, I'll just leave it untill I'll have something better to do with my connection :)"
,-fallen-one-,2008-01-19T13:48Z,"e hvala puno ... sad kad opet ide na TVu, ba? je odli?no to gledat ... :D 

yay! awesome! i'll seed!"
,u774,2008-04-05T07:11Z,"Thanks a bunch vedran.  I love this series and I don't know what everyone is bitching about.  All the episodes I have watched so far play just fine.  Some people are so ungrateful - they get a complete TV series for free and whine about having to wait for it to download.  One has to expect it will take a while for 32,000 MB to transfer...  I had my PC running 24/7 for about a week and it all came in.  I love you for this!"
,DoctorMe,2008-07-04T02:13Z,Holy shit this show is bad. It's bad even for the 90's. The script reads like a cheesy soap opera and you can see every plot twist comming a mile away. All the camera angles and screenplay are so unoriginal and boring that the only excuse I can think of for them is if they had to do each episode on a $20.00 budget! Literally the only draw for this series is how good looking Nikita and mr.-chisel-face are.  In episode one you get a bare hint of side boobie and that's it; so even the sex appeal doesn't make this worth watching. I deleted it after watching episodes one and two- don't waste your hard drive space or your bandwidth on this guys.
,tiffany22,2008-07-06T02:35Z,"Awesome upload and I'm sure a lot of work. Thanks.
(What kind of numnuts would download a 33 Gig file without knowing anything about it?)"

,some0therguy,2008-12-14T22:02Z,"DoctorMe

this is 1 if not the best tv shows ever aired.


way to leech and just delete everything because you're a pea brain.

,proplay141,2009-12-20T22:02Z,"to baby1730 , and  fa81  the problem here is that every one is uploading at the default settings of 74kbs ,u all need to set your upload at maximum so it can be shared between us all quicker remember u all if u want to get this file faster u need to change your upload to unlimited i have been uploading  at max for 3 months at  274kps u all need to thank me if u r getting this file at all but the other seders are stingy mother fuckers and limit thier upload to 5kps i will continue at  max until jan 30 enjoy everyone remember the faster the file is uploaded the faster we will all get it thanks you all  e mail me at proplay141@yahoo.com"

,WvBrsci,2010-09-11T04:04Z,"Thanks for the up, vedran! I can see from the comments that the downloading of this will be an adventure unto itself! Armed with patience, a never sleeping PC, and plentiful bandwidth, I shall prevail! Naturally, I'll share the benefits of my insomniac PC and obese bandwidth. I seed until I've seen, which, in this case, will take a while..."

,dan_p81,2012-01-18T06:56Z,"The speed on this started out real slow, but then shot of like a rocket, so a little patience can pay of.

But there's some pressure to download and not many seeders, so please keep seeding.
I'll leave this one running a bit longer."
