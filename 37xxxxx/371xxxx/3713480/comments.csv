THX, but:

Please consider getting the id3 tags consistant next time ;-)

On CD1 it is the name of the orchestra listed as Artist. On CD2 it is the composer...

ID3v2 can actually handle composer/performer information, so if you use lame to encode something along the lines of --id3v2-only will make the rest obvious ;-)

And remember, never trust CDDB info on classical music.. too many opinions how to subscribe the info..

Naturally i am not pointing all this out to be an arsehole, but rather to aid the quality of p2p releases :-)"
