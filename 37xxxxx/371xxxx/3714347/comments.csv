,Pirate 32,2007-11-05T18:22Z,"Video: 608x240 DivX 5.2.1 25fps 1047kbps

Audio: AC3(Dolby Digital) 384kbps 5.1 surround

Overall quality...  very crappy given it's large filesize.  It should have a higher resolution, doesn't seem like the ripper encoded this as a two-pass.

I would definently reccomend getting this:
http://www.torrentbox.com/torrent_details?id=110179

The resolution is 672x288 @ 25fps 

The BitRate is: 1057kbps"
,macsponge,2007-11-10T01:05Z,Pirate 32 it was ripped by me with gordon knot with 2 passes.this was my first time using gk and i liked so i upped it. the quality factor counts imo not the resolution. 
,dilbertgeg,2008-08-09T13:27Z,I know this 8 year old who wants this.  Hope he likes it. thanx
