Comments:

 Well this was my 2nd time out seein roger on his own, 

first was back in 99 in toronto,this measured up nicely.

I do agree with some of the comments on other darkside 

tour shows posted taht the leaving beirut bit is kinda 

overkil,still a very cool concept visually and a genuine

 cool true story behind the song itself. Setlist was great

, a few i hadn\'t heard live before and sheep baby sheep,

i love the animals album,i think he should go out and 

play that whole album live. seeing darkside in its entirity

was a true rock n\' roll experience and man the stage/light show

was phenomeanal,the radio controlled floating spaceman and pig

and the giant prism and visuals on the back screen , ohh man!!!

i\'d only had a few beers taht night and almost started trippin 

out on the visuals for darkside,very cool

overall great show,go see one this tour if ya can!!!!!

recording turned out decent,i\'m quite happy with these church 

audio mics, easy tapin job,no hassles,people in the smoking 

section on the 2000 level were smokin so much weed out there 

they sent in the cops and started searchin people left and right,

 i don\'t think anybody was charged or nuthin but they were confiscating

joints alot.



scooby says stay hip
