,ac0de,2007-08-13T20:25Z,how about making a torrent with the dvds instead of dvdrip? ;)
,T-1OOO,2007-08-13T20:30Z,"because there's people who doesn't have a DVD player that can handle burned DVD:s!
Anyway... I have not ripped this myself. No one is pushing you to download! If this torrent isn't good for you just wait for the full DVD torrent to come out or simply buy one copy!"
,filmster,2007-08-25T12:51Z,anyone prepared to upload the full DVD version of this ??
,sotiricon,2007-09-26T10:25Z,seed please.........

,Laughing Cadaver,2007-10-11T06:03Z,Thanks! Some of us prefer ripped format anyway! :)
,Manlamancha,2007-11-16T15:46Z,Thanks T-1000!
,numbty,2008-02-22T15:52Z,cheers mate. Love seinfeld
,AxBattler,2008-03-06T23:00Z,"Awsome T-1000!
I've also downloaded your seasons 1-7 DVDrips and they are absolutely great!
When will we see Season 9 DVDrips?

Thanks a lot for your efforts!"
,Zlimer,2008-03-14T21:49Z,"i just LOOOOVE seinfeld, thank youse very mucho"
,sasin9,2008-09-26T17:55Z,"Yes I enjoy when they are ripped so i dont have to download like 5 gigs for four episodes when they are in DVD format. If you absolutely need DVD format you are retarded, and should get a computer with HDMI or reg. AV out, or a PS3. Stop complaining, your way is stupid. Do you really need to waste time downloading the other audio tracks? And waste disks? Buy a ps3 I promise you will like it."
,paleolover,2009-01-02T10:03Z,"Thanks again T-1000.
I just finished and am sharing Seasons 1-7 (DVD) from your other torrent and just started on this one. Any chance you could put up Season in in DVD-rip?
Cheers"
,caserrr,2009-01-05T01:04Z,"does anyone know if this was ripped from a pal or ntsc dvd? not that its a huge deal, really. the slightly higher voices from a pal rip just bug me"
,bullthorn,2009-02-20T05:03Z,"Thanks for sharing this.  No complaints here,  I love the individual rips."
,W4R3,2009-02-25T18:50Z,"nice upload T-1000.  stop talking shit on him, especially when you haven't contributed fuck all of your own.  i dont see anywhere where subtitles were promised, and the quality is great.

again, nice upload, and thank you.

all you haters can eat a dick and die.

keep up the good work, matey."
,W4R3,2009-02-25T18:51Z,"caser, there is software to correct any problems you may have with the audio, albeit temporarily via preset or customizable equalizer-esque options.  check it out, if you hate the PAL audio that much.  good luck."
,drjft,2010-03-21T14:18Z,"Awesome torrent. Quality is perfect.

Will seed for quite a while :)"
[T],artpepper,2010-03-30T01:12Z,"God knows what some people are whining about. I downloaded 1-7 from you and they were perfect for watching on my 17"" laptop. 

You'll note that the worst whiners are people who never upload a thing. Fuck 'em.

 Thanks for your work and I look forward to watching this rip as well."
,justinjump,2010-05-13T01:30Z,"I am somewhat of a newbie (noob, I believe) with torrents. This downloaded well, I have all the files and they all play fine (magnificent picture quality!) but with no AUDIO! It's driving me crazy. Did I download it wrong? Is there something I'm missing? Should I just delete them all and download it again? Thanks for any help you guys can give. And thanks for ripping this season, it's incredible."
,steviekeyz,2010-09-17T16:21Z,"Thx, you and your quality rock. When will you do season 9? "
,Ap4che,2011-05-16T05:51Z,What a bunch of ball licking ass fucks on this web site! Thanks a million T-100 for your time spent in posting this torrent. All the haters can fill a bathtub up with water and go lay face down in it.
