,mtbmed,2007-11-17T05:13Z,"Thank you for upping in flac ... Hi quality music is the ONLY way to fly :-)

@blashe, flac takes up more room cuz it is typically used to compress (lossless) the original .wav files ripped at 1411 kbps rather than low quality mp3"
,q84_fH,2007-11-23T11:34Z,I agree! Thank you very much!
,centime,2008-04-23T09:51Z,"Thank you, bs-ogre, for this great download.  I downloaded another one, but the sound quality was so bad, I went looking for an alternative.  I should have stopped here first, but I didn't know about .flac vs .mp3...  Now I do :)

Thanks, mtbmed, for making it clear.  It is well worth the wait.

Nice one, bs-ogre"
,centime,2008-04-23T13:28Z,"Me again.  I had to come back, after I finished the download and listened to the music, to say that anyone who doesn't want to download this torrent because of the file sizes, think again.  The sound quality is SO MUCH BETTER than .mp3.

The one I dowloaded, with the .mp3 files (I won't say which one), was muffled, scratchy, with so much noise that I couldn't even listen to it.  So I came back and found this one.  Worth every minute of the wait.

Thanks again, bs-ogre :)"
