,rachmm,2007-06-23T02:38Z,"For those who have finished the dl and the uploader as well, please keep on seeding.  There are still people downloading after you. You have to consider that this is 3.78 Gb size, and this needs some more time to complete... Please don't be greedy......"
,a1961,2007-06-25T19:20Z,Thanks a lot vh14a.

,Perezp51,2007-07-07T09:03Z,"ok can you please tell me how to install it?

sorry but i am new to torrents"
,SuPrAZ,2007-07-16T01:39Z,"Anybody who downloaded can upload the activation keygen found in the cd1 to rapidshare or something, because i need it =/"
,SuPrAZ,2007-07-17T01:12Z,"Since none of you fags who downloaded this dvd are kind enough to provide the activation keygen, i took the liberty of dling the entire 1st DVD. Here's the file for the others who are seeking for it. 
P.S. you probably have to reinstall and do what the instructions tell you, atleast thats what i had to do in order for it to work

,rdm6265,2007-08-07T14:18Z,"""""aljecrack at 2007-07-29 18:11 CET:
Does this run on vista""""

In vista you can right click files/properties  and change/set run as  compatability to XP etc.
I think it would if it is ""2008"" type thing."
,dewy195,2007-08-12T04:04Z,"I've downloaded this and there is no setup file just an "".iso"" file along with other files. How do I get this to work?"

,PsychoH-j,2007-08-14T10:17Z,"Stucked on 99,8%!! Seed!! Don't do hit and run!! Seed after download!! I need this program!!"

,schumi1971,2007-08-30T23:41Z,THIS IS JUST SHIT
,BOMM2,2007-09-12T15:59Z,"Great stuff, vh14a - thank you for sharing!

Watch out for p2p corrupters in the swarm and let your BT software check the completed download before extracting and burning etc...

It runs in an August 30, 2007 updated Vista without tweaking anything. It is /unsupported/ in Vista but then again, if you want support you wouldn't get the software from here?"
,andreasXPS,2007-09-15T14:24Z,"Runns and works perfect!

Easy installing, really nice job vh14a ! :) 

Thanks!"
,Ya,2007-09-20T19:36Z,"Please help.

AutoCad 2008 IS running and on the license screen... Cant figure out whats wrong, so please help me"
,rocket100,2007-10-08T05:18Z,I would backup your registry and set a system restore.  Typical programmers. They NEVER clean up after an uninstall. Registry was littered with Autodesk leftovers.  Another software to NOT USE is Pinnacle. Same damn problem. Stupid programmers
,musicboyxiii,2007-10-21T09:39Z,"How do I have to install this?
I extracted the most of the rar-files, but
my computer couldn't read any extension!
please help me!"
,wulffman,2007-10-28T16:53Z,"Hi. Ive got same problems as ""YA"". ..Did you solve the problem ?.

Im not a pro on computers, doing what ""rocket100"" says (backup your registry and set a system restore). Is it easily done ?

,acatak,2009-08-07T17:48Z,"wtf do you do with all the files?

where do you extract them 2?"
,dontcomplain-its-all-free,2010-04-26T00:40Z,"Installation Erro: Can't ""write keys""... A fix for this (for me) was to change the ""rights"" on the those registry keys in the registry. Open regedit, go to the keys that are in the error message and right-click and choose PERMISSIONS. Now I cheated.. and was lazy and just set the group ""EVERYONE"" to FULL on the parent key that covered the handful of individual ones that the install complained about. Yes, XP security will be an issue. But Windows is one giant risk anyways?.. I wanted this to install without error to get rid of that lingering Q  ""what won't work?"". But after the regedit, not a single installation hiccup. note: You could go back and return the keys to what they were.. if you are concerned (if these are static keys)."
