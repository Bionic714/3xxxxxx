[b]SYNOPSIS[/b]:

The 17-year old singer/actress Isabella Leong has become many Hong Kong young boys' favorite, and Wilson Chan Bo-lin's charm continues from Bluegate Crossing, The Eye 10 to the present Bug Me Not!

Isabella is Moon, a girl who possesses the supernatural power to communicate with insects. She has a crush on the handsome boy Gao Yuan (Chan Bo-lin) who runs super fast but secludes himself from contacting anyone. A cute ladybug named Cootchie encourages Moon to confess her love to Gao Yuan, but that of course scares away Gao Yaun who freaks out when getting in touch with people...

The film features an all-star cast with Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung from Twins, and Kenny Kwan and Steven Cheung formerly or now Boyz members to play residents of a place called Psychic Park where every youngster possesses some supernatural power. Popular singer Candy Lo portrays Moon's mother who is addicted to Mahjong but has never won. Director Lo Chi Leung, starting as a script writer, shows great talent in narrating an urban fantasy, apart from exploring people's psyche as in Inner Senses and Coma. The CG technologies used to create Cootchie and its buddies are also something one must not miss.
