Rez. The psychedelic best game you've never played from the ps2's early days. Factory sealed versions of this are still going for $40+ on ebay. This amazing game is one that we can't afford to lose to drm and unsupported formats. Don't let the fact that its no longer in production stop your fun. Seed and Enjoy.
