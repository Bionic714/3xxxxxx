any known issues?"
,fury-wellfedded,2008-02-19T20:09Z,"Damn! You are right! This f***n image wont work! Even PS2 emulator Pcsx2 says that there is loopy sector read sequence (after sector 97530 it says ""uliop :IOP Reboot Success!!"" and loops at 16 48 32 16 38 42 etc). But disc structure seems to be correct. 
Wasted traffic."
,fury-wellfedded,2008-02-29T19:41Z,"I wrote it with sub-channels, there was no loopy sector reading. It works on PS2 emulator, but not on PS2 hardware. PS2 dont want to see files on burned disc but says that this is a PS2. "
,cptno,2008-03-06T01:10Z,tested and works with hdloader
,ph1nn,2008-11-27T00:44Z,could anyone seed this?
,ph1nn,2008-11-27T22:27Z,I burned this like I've always done with backups and it doesn't work on my DMS4 mod chipped PS2... The Dreamcast torrent works fine with an emulator however.  Any thoughts on getting this working?
