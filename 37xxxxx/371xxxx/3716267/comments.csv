,Promenius,2008-03-22T14:09Z,"Guys, to get this to work on the PC Emulator ePSXe, then you can do two things:

A: You can use the 1.5.2 version of ePSXe, works like a charm.

B: Make a shortcut to the 1.6.0 version, go to configurations on the shortcut, and add a ""-noauto"" line (just remove the "" "")"
