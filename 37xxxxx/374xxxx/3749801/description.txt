The album's 12 all-new songs are sometimes light, sometimes dark, lyrically thought provoking, and rhythmically compelling. While the Brigade regulars are consistent on much of the record (eenor, Skerik, and new percussionist Mike "Tree Frog" Dillon), many special guests grace the album as well. "D's Diner" features sitar player Gabby Lang in addition to the triple-bass onslaught of Claypool, Norwood Fisher (Fishbone) and Lonnie Marshall (Weapon of Choice). Warren Haynes (Allman Brothers, Gov??t Mule, Phil Lesh) handles guitar on the psychedelic hillbilly stomp of "Buzzards of Green Hill" and Fish Fisher (Fishbone drummer) guests on "Whamola," a live show staple named after the unique instrument Les employs -- a one-string bass played with a drumstick. Those in the know will recognize the references in "Barrington Hall," named after a Berkeley dorm and series of parties immortalized on Primus' "Frizzle Fry," which was reissued earlier this year. Original Frog drummer Jay Lane (Ratdog, Sausage) appears on four songs, while Bay Area monster Dean Johnson also makes an appearance.
