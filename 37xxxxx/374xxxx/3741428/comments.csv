,Nerd42,2007-09-20T16:21Z,"LOL u r missing Johnny Cash's ""Ring of Fire"" which was also in the film.

its a stupid film, which like most of hollywood's crap nowadays tries to make religious people of any kind look worse than any actual spiritual evil they're against."
,Nerd42,2007-09-20T16:21Z,oh and by the way i'm downloading this to get drum samples cause there were some cool drums in the movie in different parts. i hope they're in here
,Kaplan001,2007-10-02T17:22Z,"In the sake of argument, I'll say this.

Religious people can be evil. Don't forget that Jesus is the power that drives the KKK, the muslim terrorists are acting on behalf of their religion etc.

This is probably the first time someone has started a religious debate while commenting on a torrent. Let's not make piratebay into a chat. Please don't answer to my comment. Just wanted to mention this."

,Aikido4,2008-11-30T23:19Z,"@nerd42
Religion is wrong and an evil in it self. They are all cults, no matter what """"god"""" they say is good or bad....

  Good work on the OST here. But nerd42 was right about you missing one song. loL"

,Nymis,2011-01-10T00:02Z,"Ok, so, I never planned on making an account, but i'm sick of people(nerd42) for instance, saying ridiculously arrogant things about movies based on games.  Saying that it makes religious people look bad and blah blah blah suck it up ok? It's based off of a VIDEO GAME, hollywood didn't make it like this, it was like this in the 90's so obviously its going to be like this in the movie. Quit thinking you're making a point by pointing out the faults in a god damn movie adaptation of a video game.  If you really want to say things about religion, piratebay is not the place for you, please leave -_-"
,OSX-User,2012-07-20T09:33Z,"this is a place to comment on the quality of the torrent, not to discuss theologic principals. if you didnt like the damn movie, why the fuck are you even here for the soundtrack?"
