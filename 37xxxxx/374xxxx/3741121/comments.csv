,Mr.Salty,2007-07-30T05:45Z,"Great upload, but is it all episodes cuz on episode 12 and 13 is named the same thing is it the same episode because one is .avi and .mp4 so is it just like that or same episode"
,mikey2000,2007-09-05T22:51Z,Confirmed 12 & 13 are the same movie. (ep 12)
,EnD13,2007-09-07T18:03Z,"According to IMDB, it's 13 episodes (+ the E2.5), and  the episode missing seems to be E07 - The underdog. Am I wrong? Would be nice to have this confirmed.. And yes, E12 and 13 are the same. Thx for the upload anyhow!"
,humdidum,2007-09-26T02:41Z,The people that canceled it was obviously corporate whores that looked for ratings. A quick bullet to the head would solve the problem. Unfortunately that kind of brutality is only served to the poor.
,whoknew5776,2010-06-06T13:21Z,"To EnD13: According to Episode Guide, there are only 13 episodes, of which all are listed here. There is no episode entitled, ""The Underdog."" I am downloading this torrent now. I will give my feedback when complete."
