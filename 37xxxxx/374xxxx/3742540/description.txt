Years in development, unleashed just this morning, the Babylon Project version 3.4 Final build is out at last!

Built on a custom, upgraded, enhanced and tweaked version of the award winning Descent: Freespace 2 engine!

Free and Open Source, you can create your own missions with the included Mission Editor.

Included in this torrent:

The TBP 3.4 installer PLUS every other campaign and mission currently available for this excellent game. The Babylon Project takes FreeSpace 2 to another level and the screenshots don't do the gameplay justice.

Instructions:

UNINSTALL ANY PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THE BABYLON PROJECT.

Install.
You'll need 2.5 GB free on your hard drive.

Extract the extras.
Directly into your Babylon Project directory.

Play.
Look for the Launcher in your Start menu. Runs in OpenGL and might need OpenAL sound installed.

Keyboard map and manual are included, along with six training missions!


This game is complete and requires nothing else to run.

With Extras installed you will have 17 single missions, 2 multiplayer missions, and 8 campaigns to enjoy.

At the Main menu, select Campaign or Tech Data.
