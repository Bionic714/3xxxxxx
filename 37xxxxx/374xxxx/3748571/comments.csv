,cub91,2007-07-21T17:54Z,Thanks for these
,jmg999,2009-02-04T08:41Z,There's no clear indication on how to play the English audio.  When you play the DVD the menu gives you a choice of either Castellano or Portuguese.  Please explain how to play this DVD in English.  Thank you.  
,torgman1,2009-02-17T04:41Z,"jmg999: select any language. For Castellano (aka, Spanish), pick ""seleccion de audio y subtitulos"" then pick ""ingles."" For Portuguese, pick ""configuacao"", then pick ""ingles."" If you play this in WMP, right click on the movie while it plays and you can select a language there.

Now, can someone tell me how to get this to fit on a whole DVD-R or how to get it so it will play on another computer and my DVD player? My Nero won't let me do it. "
