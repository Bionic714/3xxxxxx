Features:

Covers the Greater Auckland area (7000 sq kms), from Whangaparoa Peninsula in the North to Pokeno in the South; from the Rangitira Beach in the West to the Firth of Thames in the East; 

Photoreal textures derived from top-quality 2.5m/pixel aerial photographs, meticulously adjusted to convert from New Zealand's non-standard mapping convention; 

Night textures to add life to the city after dark!; 

Accurately placed to match the newly-released Geographx 20 metre/40 metre/76 metre elevation mesh (includes 76 metre mesh as a 'sampler'); 

Also compatible with 76 metre SRTM elevaton meshes, but not the 'old' Geographx 40 or 150 metre meshes; 

Compatible with the up-coming high definition coastlines -- now for the first time in New Zealand, realistic photographic coastal features including cliffs! (within the limitations of the simulator.) 

Autogen -- 'automatically generated' vegetation and buildings to give a realistic low-level VFR flying experience; 
'Autogen Boats' -- a new feature to realistically define the City of Sails! 

Customised buildings -- custom-modelled Central Business District, hospitals; 

Other customised scenery, including a realistic waterfront; 
Customised Airport Facility files to match airports to the aerial imagery, and correct default elevations; 

Forms the basis on an ongoing project to develop accurate, custom-built, photo-realistic airports within the Auckland area (airports not included in initial 'base pack' release.)
