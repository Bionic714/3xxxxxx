,xkexkexke,2008-02-17T17:11Z,"Very nice movie with the superstar Jet Li. In this movie Jet Li 
impersonates Danny, who has been kept as a near-prisoner by Uncle Bart 
in a cage and trained to attack and if it is necessary to kill. Danny 
knows little of life, except the brutal existence that Bart has so 
cruelly and crudely fashioned for him. When Danny has a chance 
encounter with soft-spoken blind piano tuner Sam (Morgan Freeman), he 
senses true kindness and compassion for the first time and experiences 
the transforming power of music....For more information go to
