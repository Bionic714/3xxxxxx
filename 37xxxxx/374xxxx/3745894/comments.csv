,fubmonkey,2007-12-26T20:29Z,Is there a way to remove the subtitles? I dont see a subtitle file...
,ionut_a,2008-01-06T08:48Z,"i don't think you can remove these subtitles.. i think they're called hard top:-?

i wish they would just put a normale .srt file so someone who doesn't speak swedish doesn't have to view them"
,thepandoras,2008-03-12T02:26Z,"Good quality and everything, but the subtitles are programmed into the video, so you can't take them out. They're all on the bottom-left part of the video, and aren't annoying or anything."
