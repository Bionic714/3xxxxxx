,cabron2323,2007-07-24T08:17Z,"when the download is finished, use a program like alcohol 120% to burn the cd image to a DVD.
put the DVD into your disk drive and you can either upgrade your existing XP OS or reboot and reformat. (i recomend reformatting)
when you finish installing vista, open the disc in explorer and open the [+] folder, there are instructions on how to crack."

,cabron2323,2007-07-27T02:49Z,"read the instructions very carefully.
i had trouble the first time, it is quite difficult, but i assure you it does work.
(just before you install the crack set the system clock to 2099, apply the crack and reset the clock after intallation"

,peaceloveandgoo,2007-08-05T04:26Z,i dont have a dvd burner. Is it possible to put it on multiple cd's instead of 1 dvd? or can i just mount in with daemon tools or alcohol 120% and run the program?
,destructoPop,2007-08-13T08:12Z,"You don't need a burner, Peace Love and Goo. Just a DVD drive and a program for mounting discs. I love PowerISO. Anyhow, once you have a good program like PowerISO, right click the file and mount in drive. The go to My Computer and explore it like a normal disc. Helpful?"

,PacoGrande,2007-08-23T20:24Z,"You are seeding while you are downloading, and if you leave the torrent open in your download application (like azureus) after the download finished you are purely seeding (uploading).

By the way, Cabron, is al the Norton software pre-installed or do i have the option not to install it ? "

,punkmaniac93,2008-02-24T21:47Z,everyone should wait until Microsoft fixes all the bugs and compatibility issues in Vista before downloading it...and wait until they do...and hopefully someone on here will upload it
,SpartanAK47,2008-03-28T13:40Z,"hey UnrealG vista does not suck, u have da crappiest knowledge of pcs ever!! vista DOES play games u dumb big mouth retard, in fact, y do u think they built all these new graphics drivers which r designed 4 directx 10 which is vista compatible only. games i have 4 pc r Age of empires 1,2 & 3 & all expansions, halo 1 & 2, Call of duty 4, star wars battlefront 1 & 2 but got rid of crysis cos it was disappointing game"
