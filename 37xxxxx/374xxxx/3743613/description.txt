GHOST RECON ADVANCED WARFIGHTER 2 ENTRY LEVEL TRAINER
           *****************************************************

 An entry level trainer basically helps us get out a quick and small selection
of options so that you can start cheating immediately and we can also find any
bugs that you report back for us to fix, its very much a community thing and
we hope that everyone benefits from it, thanks.

OPTION USAGE AND NOTES
**********************


Y - INFINITE HEALTH
*******************

Just as the option says, this gives you infinite health once the option
is enabled, I tried my hardest to test with everything i can think of, so
far we have been blown up by C4, a tank, mortars, ran over by tanks and
even fell down a cliff and nothing managed to kill us so im pretty sure
this options is 100%.


************************************************

U - INFINITE AMMO
*****************

Same again, tap the key and get infinite ammo for ALL weapons.
This includes rocket launchers which this option actually makes
them into mini explosion machines as you dont have to go through
the boring RELOAD process.

************************************************

I - INFINITE GRENADES
*********************

Another simple option, though nothing in this game was truely 
simple. Hit the button for BIG BOOM BOOM!

************************************************

O - NO RECOIL
*************

Just as the option says, enable it and you will no longer have those
arm spasms when unloading a clip.

************************************************


P - SUPER SPEED
***************

Oh yes, ladies and gentlemen, gamehacking.co.uk bring you an exclusive
from the brainpan of APACHE himself, this super speed option will have
you flying around the place like a mental spongecake.. remember we 
bring you the best!!!


************************************************


T - ENEMY GUN JAMMER
********************

Again, another first for you, stick this little baby on and watch the idiot
enemy wonder why they are having to reload and unjam after every round..
