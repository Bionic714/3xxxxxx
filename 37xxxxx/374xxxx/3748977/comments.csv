,purplepants35,2007-11-20T23:05Z,"well maybe it will work for other people, it has worked for me for the longest time but today i go to run tuneup and it says my copy is not genuine so first thought i tried Name: BUBlic

Company: TSRh

Serial: KHH6A-8NKJE-9175Y-MS4LK-3TEPG-6SSXA
again to see if it will work this time maybe the key file was corrupt or something it accepts it and says needs to restart so i restart and get the same msg not genuine so for me it doesnt work so if anyone knows of a different serial to use please let me know thanks"
