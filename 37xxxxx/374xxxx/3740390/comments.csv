,Craftplayer,2007-07-13T07:29Z,why is that?
,Craftplayer,2007-07-13T07:58Z,"just to clarify portable programs for people that do not know then, this is a single .exe file that runs the whole program it is packaged using an enterprise software called Thinstall. Read up on Thinstall for more info but its a good enuff portable app creator to make microsoft office 2007 portable, I run it off my portable hard drive all the time. (which is the main point of a portable application to be able to be put on a usb drive and taken to any computer without needing to worry about installing or adjusting settings)"

,Craftplayer,2007-07-13T21:07Z,"no errors on any of the computers I have tried, make sure your system meets the requirements. Otherwise your file may just be corrupted you will have to get it again."
