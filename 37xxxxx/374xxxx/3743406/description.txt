God called Henry Gruver 40 years ago to walk and pray over cities. He has systematically walked over 500 cities, pulling down strongholds. He has had knives at his throat; had guns held to his head that have misfired; and gangs have approached him and given their hearts to Jesus. Hear how God called Henry to walk in the anointing of the Holy Spirit to pray over cities. Hear inspiring incidents of God protecting him. 2hrs 27min.
