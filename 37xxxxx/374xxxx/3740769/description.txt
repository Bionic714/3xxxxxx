I compiled some of the progs I use for making music. This pack includes Host software and VST plugins.

Includes:
Cubase SX1
Wavelab 5

Lots of VST instruments and effects from developers including:
Novation
Waves
Korg
Native Instruments
Waldorf
Steinberg
TC Works
Antares

This is more or less everything I use when making music. Everything works, cracks included where needed, and everything is highly useable!
