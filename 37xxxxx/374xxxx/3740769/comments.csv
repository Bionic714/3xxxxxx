,checkmate444,2007-07-15T04:59Z,"This is a great collection of music creation tools. 
Everything from putting together an orchestra to editing .wav samples or loops.
Well done!"
,barlon,2007-07-15T11:53Z,"Thanks checkmate :)
The idea was to put together someting that could be used for almost anything. Glad you like it!"

,Avenget,2007-08-07T21:58Z,"Hope it's better than Magix Music Maker 2005

BTW this version of cubase... is it possible to do these effects that my bass-teacher told me about, with ""send"" effects and ""insert"" effects?"
,Avenget,2007-08-07T22:01Z,"I tried Nero Soundtrax to distort a guittar line but I couldn't seal off the original sound, like I think you could in cubase, to make clean distortion and such without having the real guittar sound left in it."
,barlon,2007-08-08T23:54Z,"It's possible to use both inserts and sends in all versions of Cubase. Try putting a send effect in pre-mode by clicking the third button above the effect (the one to the right of the ""e"" button). Set the channel volume to 0 and use the effect only. Now you should have no sound except for that routed through the effect. "
,Panodilo,2007-08-09T23:48Z,lol  sx1 is shit from a performance perspective. The audio engine in sx1 was scrapped because it was slow and ineffeciant.
,triplexbeatz,2007-08-31T09:56Z,"Avenget ,

what you are describing it referred to as WET and DRY signal. The signal from your input (guitar in your case) is DRY and the effect applied to the input is considered WET.

Many effects plug-ins have the allow you to adjust the wet and dry signals independently. thus you could turn the dry completely down and leave the way all the way up to achieve your desired effect. It will take much experimenting to find the sounds your looking for, but in doing so you will discover much more.
try ""guitar rig 2"" a direct guitar PC plugin."
,Traumzilla,2007-09-15T00:56Z,"This download contains a virus threat embedded in one of the files. It cannot be healed. I would strongly advise determining where this threat is located in particular and having it removed. If any of you have opened this archive without scanning it, you now have a virus or had a virus. Im a little disappointed right now because I was very excited to gain some new tools for my fresh production PC. Trust this comment, the archive is corrupted."
,Traumzilla,2007-09-15T00:57Z,"In other words, you can download it. After its finished, scan it before you open it and you'll find it detects one infected file that cannot be healed."

,g047,2007-09-26T19:27Z,"Sadness :(

I only need VSTi's. Not that I wouldnt download it all and seed it, but I need the VST's now :(

God I hate RAR's :("
,cubbiechub,2007-09-27T22:38Z,"You do realise that most Antivirus software, be it free or payware include definition updates which define not only viruses, trojans, spyware, malware and worms but also KEYGENS, CRACKS, PATCHES and other software intended either as a way of circumventing, removing or reprogramming copy protected software, even if they are not infected.

These antivirus companies are paid off by the relevant software manufacturers to find these keygens etc. and report them as threats rather than telling you that they are copied software or tools to use such.

People stupid enough not to do their homework blindly delete the files that are put in 'quarantine' believing that they are somehow harmful to their computer.

I have scanned various keygens, cracks, patches and software that's had the copy protection removed and even though there are no viruses, my scanners have told me these files pose a significant threat threat. THEY LIE.

When Googling these threats with the obscure codename that the virus scanner gives them I find absolutely no evidence that these viruses exist, they are a red herring to make you BELIEVE that the files are virus ridden when in fact they are not.

It does it with Windows XP WGA permanent patcher, Splitcam (even though that is freeware it generates a false positive), many VST plugins for music software created by AIR and H2O and various other cracked, patched and otherwise compromised software.

Rule of thumb, DO YOUR HOMEWORK!"
,Tanka.,2007-10-15T21:11Z,Seed Please!
,elefantsnablar,2007-11-14T18:59Z,i'm sad so seed :)
,elefantsnablar,2007-11-15T17:17Z,How do you activate the instrument in cubase?
,cruzz1,2007-12-15T03:20Z,VIRUS FOUND WIN32 POLY CRYPT
,Avenget,2007-12-18T19:46Z,I have a question and I thought you ought to know the answer. How do I get the track control send/insert to work with my MIDI mixes? The chorder works just fine and the track fx too but not the control. The control has a distortion effect that would be fun to use but I cant get it to sound. do tou know how?
,Avenget,2007-12-18T19:58Z,"Elefantsnablar
Press F11, a window appears with scroll-downs saying ""no VST instrument"". click one of those and a list of all the installed VSTis will appear from which you can select your instrument. After doing that you must select a prefered MIDI track and look to the right. below the volume, pan and delay bars you see two roll-downs that says ""in"" and ""out"". press the out roll-down and select the VST. Now make some music!"
,bearcy,2008-01-13T21:23Z,"I'm still seeding VSTi collection! Have got it at a 100 %, and will continue seeding.

This file also contain Steinberg WaveLab 5.01b - cracked by H2O and working surprisingly well!

If you want WaveLab 5.01b with a crack that makes it work under Windows Vista, however, you may have to download this torrent as well:

,barlon,2008-01-25T02:06Z,"Lot of talk about viruses which i find a bit strange. When I compiled this pack I was running NAV and it didn't warn me of anything. 

Should there be a virus I apologize, but I sure didn't see anything when creating this. "

However, I'm wondering - does anyone have the MOTU ETHNO Virtual Instrument/Synthesizer cracked? I've been looking to try that piece out for a good time as it seems really well-done. :)"

Really nice of you to put a usable collection of apps and plugs together like this. Much appreciated.
