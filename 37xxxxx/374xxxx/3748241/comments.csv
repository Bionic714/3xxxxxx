,CoolDude3000,2008-08-13T19:49Z,"I've tried:
VirtualDub 1.3.0c,
VirtualDub 1.6.4,
VirtualDub-MPEG,
VirtualDubMod,
the Haali MatroskaSplitter DS Mux (gdsmux.exe), 
WMNicEnc,
GoldWave,
in combination CCCP and a whole bunch of other programs but I've had no success in muxing this .dts file with the SiLU .MKV video...

I've tried converting the .dts file to another format but none of my conversion programs understand it even though MPlayer Classic plays it fine. I even tried renaming it to .dts.wav but that didn't help...

Does anyone have any suggestions how I can go about muxing this audio with the original .mkv video?

Cheers,"
