,Hulex,2008-02-27T20:04Z,"What the hell, rar? Why not allow people to download individual files?"
,Hulex,2008-02-27T22:31Z,Also holy crap this skips like crazy
,Crovean,2008-02-29T21:01Z,"The reason I rar my mp3 files are quite simple... ;D Some guys hears one song on the radio and they want to download THAT song, but then they miss alot of others songs that are great on the same album...

simple"
,Ancient-X,2008-04-06T12:40Z,"Crovean, its not very good, cuz maybe i have all songs already but one is corrupted and i want to DL just it, but instead i have to DL the entire album... + RAR's have a habit of corrupting themselves.... And it takes 2 times more space on your HDD when you extract... if a guy has not much space of his HDD that is very inconvenient ;)"
