This is a direct copy of a promo DVD I recieved, no alterations other than being run through DVD Shrink to remove any region/macrovision protection, and mainly to rip the files to the HDD. 

I have added another directory named 'Xtra' so that the disc art & this txt file may be retained on the DVD. I've done this for years without any issues with any DVD players.

Enjoy :)
