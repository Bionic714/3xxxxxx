and turn the auto downloads off you should be able to use the full version until the next time you want to update and then manually update re enter the code and it should be all good again. I only update about once a month so its not too much trouble. If you leave auto update on it will update once a day which is excessive anyway"
,ad011i6510,2007-09-07T00:09Z,BUT IF YOU DONT UPDATE REGULAR YOU R NOT PROPERLY PROTECTED SO WHATS THE POINT.
,DudeRisk,2007-09-15T17:21Z,"Use manual update then, it isn't that hard.

First of all.. Most serials works but when the ""Update"" comes it doesn't work anymore & you need to use the same serial, over and over again, can be a pain in the arse. That's why.. You should just edit/crack the scripts in the AVG dir which would solve the problem."
