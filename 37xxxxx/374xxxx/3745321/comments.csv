 All you need to do is unpack the files. Use winrar and right click one any of the files to unpack all of them...Hope this helped"

CHRISTIAN PROPAGANDA? The evidence that GOD an all powerful wise being exists is all around you - you just have to look to see it. 
Then again, he made you - so maybe he was just fucking with us !

,madhouserevival,2007-08-19T09:35Z,"sound is not great (like 2 channels) and the video has 5 or 6 patches that are distorted and skip very moments of the film, but not enough to ruin it. It's fun to watch."
