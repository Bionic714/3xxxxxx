 Very good movie from Russia. If you like dark comedies you are going to really enjoy this one. Well filmed, brilliant photography, well acted.
Lyosha (A. Podolsky) is a spineless depressed overweight guy who lives with his grandmother, and works in a rather depressing toy assembly line. Then some guys approach him to undergo a biological experiment and make some money. The experiment has rather fargoing consequences on the life of our antihero.
