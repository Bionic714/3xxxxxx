The Stinson Model A Trimotor for FS9 and GW3 
 
Dubbed 창??Americas Fastest Tri-Motor창?? the Model A was the Stinson Aircraft Company창??s last tri-motor, designed, in 1933, as a low wing monoplane, eight seat feeder-liners for American Airways (now American Airlines). Featuring an unusual double-tapered wing that, combined with its tubby fuselage and forward-raked windscreen, gave it a markedly sinister appearance, it also boasted retractable landing gear that left the lower part of the wheels exposed below the engine nacelles while in the raised position, as many pilots forgot to lower the undercarriage on landing. Passengers were seated in two rows of three and a paired seat behind the enclosed cockpit, while fitted aft were a hold for 500 of luggage and freight, and that ultimate luxury for the time, an on-board lavatory.

A total of 30 Stinson Model As were built until production ceased in 1936. It was one of many promising designs whose commercial success was cut short by the introduction of the stressed-skin Boeing 247 and Douglas DC-2.
