,slavetoit,2007-10-26T20:56Z,Sweet I have bought a lot of these I can't wait to have them on mp3!!
,smartfast,2008-04-18T19:12Z,"is it just me .. or are all these MP3s missing internal segments?

I hear one section of the song then all of a sudden its another section .. skipping over parts. 

I have a brand new laptop with nothing else running .. its not my hardware. I've played it on 3 different media players .. its not my software. 

Why did it download like that??!!"
,smartfast,2008-04-18T19:15Z,"HAHA nevermind .. i figured it out.

Obviously, you can only listen to the pieces of each file that you have downloaded so far ....
