,BassMint,2007-08-24T12:55Z,"works perfect?   how the hell do you figure that?  you download this, then try to open the exe file and you get windows error and microsoft begging you to send them all your info in the failed report.

  real funny.   maybe it did work?  and some one jacked it up?  "
,papabob2,2007-08-26T10:54Z,If you install this program you will inherit a virus that will keep shutting down your computer. This virus is not picked up with my antivirus (avg)?however if you do decide to download despite my warning and fuck up: press f8 (dos) and chose the option to start windows in last know good configuration that worked?and good luck. May the filth that did to me rot in hell.
,danzig-7766,2007-08-28T14:37Z,"yer my experince is when they suck the prg off like sheiky boy did its usally fucked up, the company that makes the product will put these out to try and fuck you up so you say fuck it ill just buy it...but then WE say no fuck you we""ll just dl eleswhere hahaha fuckers \m/"
,SnowKid32,2007-09-11T05:56Z,Do you fuckers think it's funny to upload viruses to this shit? Stop being a fucking asshole man. JUST STOP.
,fredsboy,2007-09-11T20:28Z,"well I did not find a virus,works well only fault cannot find name to reg with,can someone help please,apart from that excelent upload"
,FuzzyBunny420,2007-09-23T01:47Z,DO NOT DOWNLOADE IF USING VISTA!
,Patch&Burn,2007-09-27T07:18Z,"Wow, for all you newcomers, look keygenerators always read as trojans!! OK I have a very good virus program that will quarrentee my key gen everytime I try to open it, I shut it off and make the key then I turn it back on. Stop crying already. If you cant deal with this shit then dont download FREE stuff from here. I am tired of people who dont know what the fuck they are talking about, bashing someone who took the time to put this software up for us. What have YOU put up? EVER?? So shut the fuck up!!   "
,papabob2,2007-10-04T20:41Z,keygen does not show as a trojan thats my point. anyway why do you isolate your keygen if it isnt a virus? to others who are not as clever and as tired as you...If you do download this program you will be in a world of shit. Your computer will switch itself off a few seconds after it starts windows. Every time? The remedy is to pull the power cord as windows starts and when you restart your computer you will be given the dos screen.. Choose start windows in safe mode then stop power iso on the start menu and delete it from program files.. not easy. be warned.
,bigreen,2007-10-05T02:42Z,"Installed and used keygen to register online. Once I begin to use a file, I get the message that the TRAIL VERSION will only work with files under 300mb. I thought registering would allow you to run all files?
I have downloaded this and two other torrents with keygen and get the same result. I have registered 4 times and it still will not run the file."
,forumsfeedback,2007-10-30T11:48Z,Works to some extent but does keep requiring reinstalling as it will work for a while and then claim you haven't registered it.
,Assproking,2008-02-06T19:36Z,Thanks I only have use the keygen! .. But alot of Thanks :P
