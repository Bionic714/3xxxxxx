Synopsis:

As the boundaries of the traditional enterprise continue to expand, demand for secure mobile workforce solutions is growing at a strong pace. This demand is being addressed with a multitude of solutions - those that deliver the highest levels of productivity, security and IT control will set the pace for the marketplace. Enterprises accomplish this kind of network growth in a cost efficient and reliable way through the introduction of Broadband Remote Access Services. Broadband Network Architectures succinctly describes B-RAS (Broadband Remote Access Server/Services) and its associated technologies (PPP, L2TP). Chapters are structured to provide enough information for people looking to learn and then being to implement. By including design architectures with the explanations, as well as covering the emerging and recent advancements of the technology, this title covers a relatively new concept. Yet the book covers it in such a way that it teaches not to current models but to strategies and practices that apply across any equipment, giving the book a longer term value to the reader. The book also approaches the topics with a vendor-neutrality , offering both Cisco and Juniper configurations and policies side-by-side as the reader progresses through the book.
