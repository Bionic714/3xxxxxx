We have regular releases on Demonoid. For information on other releases, send an email or look for us there.

Some uTorrent users may have problems with the A.'.A.'. directories. Some users have found that the most recent version of uTorrent responds better to files ending with .s, and others have had success with Azureus. If all else fails, you may select the A.'.A.'. directories as"do not download", and the remainder of the torrent should complete normally.


Re-post:

This torrent represents a work of LOVE. All texts so far gathered, as well as all future gatherings aim at exposing interested students to occult information.

This mega-torrent emphasizes practical study of occult sciences. This version primarily focuses on the Western Hermetic Tradition, but a respectable amount of Eastern esoterica has also been included. Future versions of the torrent will include submissions from other interested students.

For some of us, the time has come to mobilize. If you have an interest in assisting in this process - we all have strengths to bring to the table - please email occult.digital.mobilization@gmail.com.

Complacency serves the old gods.
