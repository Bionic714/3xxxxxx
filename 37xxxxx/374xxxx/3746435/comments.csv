,heloxenes,2007-07-25T13:06Z,Is there any possibility for You to rar the files so that it becomes easier to download. Thnx for a great upload.
,netwookie,2007-08-04T23:45Z,"dude thank you!!! you deserve a medal for uploading this piece of work right here. recommended reading to anyone and everyone!
and on a side note, the A.\\\ directory downloaded properly on mine and i use utorrent."
[T],occultmobilization,2007-08-05T22:30Z,"We've been told that the newest version of uTorrent will handle the A.'.A.'. directory.

HOWEVER, I must remind all torrent users that rumors have been circulating that the recent purchase of uTorrent has included cooperation with certain governmental agencies.

Use of uTorrent has become a great deal less safe, or so the rumor goes.

Take as you will, but a cursory search on the web of recent uTorrent-related traffic should prove illuminating.

We would also encourage enthusiastic students to contact us through the address provided, as we all have strengths to bring to the table, and much work remains.

Namaste.

,psykorg,2007-10-10T05:40Z,"This looks like an awesome torrent but my BitLord couldn't handle it either, even after I spent five minutes unselecting all the A A directories. Why didn't you just rename the directories to text only and make it easier on everyone? Oh well, I am compelled to buy hard copies of the Libri for serious study (funny because I generally NEVER buy anything I can find online!)"
,reisinger,2007-12-21T17:51Z,I cant download this at all. ERROR ERROR...

,CandiedHaggis,2008-01-07T20:08Z,Awesome up!!  Thanks for this huge collection of great wisdom!  The A.'.A.'. directory worked just fine for me - using uTorrent 1.7.5 - no problems.
