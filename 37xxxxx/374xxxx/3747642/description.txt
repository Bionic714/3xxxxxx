Hi everyone, this is my first upload to PB.  I had to do it, I really wanted to watch this film, but I could not find a copy anywhere with English subtitles!  I found a DVD rip on another site but this did not have English subtitles either. So I encoded my own version -- it was worth it, this film is terrific!  

Encoded to 1.38GB as two 700MB files (2 CD's), as an .MP4, using H.264 and 160kbit/s AAC Audio.  It looks fantastic!  Almost indistinguishable from the original DVD rip.

NOTE: Subtitles have been muxed inside the file; you will likely need VLC to see the subtitles.

Enjoy!
