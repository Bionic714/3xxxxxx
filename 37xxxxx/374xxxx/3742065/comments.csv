,Condawg,2007-09-09T05:45Z,"Thanks much for this, extremely awesome.
Just a request for next time -- please properly name all episodes with

""S0E - N""

S = Season
E = Episode #
N = Episode Name


It would be nice... I'm picky about stuff, so I had to go through and change all of them :P
But still, thank you very much for this great upload."

Can anyone else confirm this? I'm playing the files on two different computers and I'm getting the same outcome.

,Dex_Luther,2009-07-15T08:14Z,"@Condawg:

There's nothing wrong with the way the episodes are named. In fact it follows the standard of episode naming (well one of them anyways). If you prefer something else, then that's your problem/choice."
