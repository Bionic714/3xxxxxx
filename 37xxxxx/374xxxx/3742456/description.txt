My name is Thomas Veil, or at least it was. I'm a photographer. I had it all: a wife, Alyson,friends, a career. And in one moment it was all taken away, all because of a single photograph. I have it. They want it. And they will do anything to get the negative. I'm keeping this diary as proof that these events are real. I know they are. They have to be.
