,vickyk73,2007-07-24T05:01Z,Come on guys i have served over 20 gb and still i don't see no one seeding the movie. This really sucks.

What about the sound?

Thanks."
,KingStar,2007-09-22T20:33Z,"Since I've not got it downloaded I'll answer my own question:
It's in wide screen format with 5.1 surround sound and it's NTSC.

Thanks for the upload vickyk73. I noticed you've uploaded Aliens (I'm downloading and will seed for a while), will you upload Alien続 as well?

Thanks again."
