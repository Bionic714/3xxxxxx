Description:

NL2000 version 3.0 released!  July 09 2007  
 
We are proud to announce that version 3.0 of our NL2000 scenery has now been released!

We worked hard on this project, and we used old as well as new techniques to be able to combine the best of them both. We would like to take this opportunity to thank our users for their patience. "The Netherlands Scenery Design Team" hopes that everybody enjoys using this scenery.

Distribution will be a unique experience in the Flightsim world, as we will be using the peer to peer Bittorrent mechanism. This is necessary because the total download volume is approximately 21 gigabaytes. We sincerely hope that everybody keeps his bittorrent client on line as long as possible so that your peer users will be able to download it as swiftly as you do (it is possible to fly and keep the client on line at the same time).
