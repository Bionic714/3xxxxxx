Download, unzip, then burn both .iso files to discs. Go through the installation process on disc 1, then insert disc 2 when instructed to during the installation process.

After you've installed the game, go back to disc 1 and look for the ""Crack"" folder... it contains your serial key and the hacked ""Alice"" file. Copy  that ""Alice"" file to your computer where the game was installed (usually within your Program Files folder). This will overwrite the original ""Alice"" file with that hacked one.

Start your game with disc 1 in your drive and begin slashing your way through Wonderland. Enjoy!! :)"

,Tysonkaiexperiment,2010-10-29T12:50Z,Followed your orders and it works perfectly! Thank you so much!
,phantomaniperv,2010-12-09T17:20Z,"So I installed and tried to put the crack into the installation folder. The file name wasn't ""Alice"", it was ""America McGee's Alice"", so I changed the crack file name first, so it would automatically replace the file. When try to play it says I have the wrong disc inserted, why?"
