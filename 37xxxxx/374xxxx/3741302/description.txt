Some words about this great game: 
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_McGee's_Alice

"American McGee's Alice is a third-person shooter computer game released on October 6, 2000. It was developed by Rogue Entertainment and published, distributed and marketed by Electronic Arts. It was designed by American McGee, and featured music composed by former Nine Inch Nails drummer Chris Vrenna. The game is powered by the Quake III engine.

Set years after Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, Alice features an older, more cynical and macabre incarnation of Alice."
