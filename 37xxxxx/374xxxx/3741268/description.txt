Civilization III Manual.

I don't know if anyone's interested. You can also find it here:

When I needed a manual, my first idea was to look for it on bittorrent trackers, so perhaps others will do the same thing.

I won't seed while I'm sleeping, so if there's no seeders, please try again later. If no one wants to download it in the first few days, I'll kill the torrent.

Cheers!
