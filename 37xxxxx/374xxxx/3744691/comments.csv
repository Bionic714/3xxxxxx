,1nteresting,2008-08-29T21:11Z,"How come you say this is a complete season, but there is only 12 episodes? There is always 20 episodes per season."
,ibarrainc,2008-11-18T03:51Z,"First, there has never been 20 episodes in a season, there are 16 episodes.  However, season one is supposed to have 13 episode.  Though episodes 1-2 are the pilot episode so maybe they are one file in this download.  I haven't finished downloading so I don't know yet.
