David Allan Coe - NOTHING SACRED (1980)
The Original X-Rated album from DAC

This album, and the soonafter-released
UNDERGROUND are not for:
* The prudish
* Those easily offended
* The \"Politically Correct\"
* or, those expecting to find another
\"You Never Called Me By My Name\"
on the tracks within.

However, those in anticipation of
being serenaded with some of the most
\"gut-busting hillarious, filthy, odes
from out there on the fringe\", will
definitely not be disapointed!
