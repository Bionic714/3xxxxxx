Honestly, if the guy who made the torrent wrote the thing in English, or even Swedish or Norwegian or whatever, why would you comment in Hungarian?"

,awiggin,2007-10-08T15:59Z,"I notice a lot of folks screaming for seeds but how many bother to stick around and seed it themselves? Almost every file I have ever tried to get I see just about every peer drop out within a few minutes of becoming a seed. You can't get the file very fast at all if nobody is willing to seed once they get it, I'll be seeding this for a while if I can manage to get it myself so I hope that some of you other folks are willing to seed for a few days at least."
