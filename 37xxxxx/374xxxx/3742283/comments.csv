,skif dank,2007-09-24T03:31Z,"I see you're new to the interwebs. If you google ""rules of the internet"" you will be directed to one of millions of pages that will let you read over the rules, be sure to read and then re-read #64. It will ALWAYS be pirated, so stop wasting time trying to prevent it and get back to 
development. You need to package ecomstation on your servers, and whatever stand alone editions you sell to corporations is bonus money for you, the average home user of this has much respek for OS/2 or they wouldn't be using this. 

Go on now, you have things to do, read the rules of the internet and then get back to coding.

You should not bother to spend time nor money on 
""protection of software"" as it's just going to get pirated anyway,  development."
