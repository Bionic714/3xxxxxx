Zoologist Nigel Marven tracks down the biological roots of our sensory perception including smell, taste, hearing balance touch and vision in this BBC series first aired in Great Britain in 2003.

Born in 1960, Nigel Marven showed early promise as a budding naturalist. He was running a hamster colony at age eight and racing stick insects along his mother?s clothes line by the time he was nine. In his early teens, Nigel had graduated to larger creatures, keeping a caiman, magpie and boa constrictors in his parents? house. He even saved a freshwater eel from being jellied, housing it in the bathtub. When anyone needed a soak, the slippery creature was put in a bucket.

Family holidays in the Mediterranean became zoological expeditions, as young Nigel scampered over the countryside, pillowcase in hand, catching snakes and lizards for study and then release. Once his school studies were over, Nigel took a year-out travelling throughout America, where he met hellbenders and amphiumas in the wild (both are kinds of salamanders). Returning to the UK, he moved to Bristol to read Botany and Zoology at university. This would prove to be the ideal place for him, because firstly he could pursue his interest in the natural world at an academic level, and secondly, Bristol is the world capital of wildlife filmmaking.

He got his first job at the world-famous BBC Natural History Unit in Bristol, and stayed there for several years. It was there that he produced and directed episodes of major international projects such as The Life of Birds (with Sir David Attenborough), Realms of the Russian Bear, The Witness was a Fly and Magpie in the Dock. In 1998 he moved from the BBC to start work on an exciting new wildlife project for Granada Television; this time he would not only produce the films, but also be in front of the camera as a presenter.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 2:

Hearing
Always alert 
Our sense of hearing is the one sense that never sleeps. It evolved to protect us from ambush at night. At the Sleep Laboratory in Swansea, Dr Mark Blagrove plays sounds to sleeping volunteers. He finds that, although they can shut out sounds when asleep, their sense of hearing is constantly alert. Another sound we respond to strongly is the human voice. Dr Sarah Collins, a behavioural expert at Nottingham University, studies the effect sexy voices have on people. She explains why deep voices are so attractive to the opposite sex.

Music and emotions 
Nigel travels to Hawaii to meet an animal which might help unravel why music has such a powerful effect on us. Once a year, hundreds of humpback whales meet up to sing their hearts out. Nigel discovers that the mating male whales sing because it's the best way to convey simple emotions to other males like 'back off' or 'you're my friend'. For us, music is all about conveying emotions.

Back in England, Nigel watches enthusiastic Status Quo fans who are clearly entranced by the very loud music. He discovers why, according to research by Dr Neil Todd at Manchester University, it may be the volume of the of the music rather than the timeless Status Quo songs that really get the audience going. 

Monday 4 August 2003, 7-7.30pm, BBC One 
Balance is our true sixth sense - it enables us to sense how our bodies are moving around in the world and keep us upright. There are only two kinds of animal that spend their whole lives performing the tricky balancing act of walking on two legs ? humans and some flightless birds, like ostriches.

Balance
Help from the eyes 
Organs in our ears help us keep our balance but for really fine balance, we need our eyes. They help us to work out exactly what the body is doing relative to the outside world. A troupe of acrobats at the Circus School in San Francisco illustrate this when they perform a human tower in darkness.

Nigel reveals why spinning round in circles makes you dizzy. And, under the guidance of Dr Ros Davies from the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, he discovers why drinking alcohol makes it hard to walk in a straight line and can make your head spin.

Our sense of balance is so complex that even if all components are working fine ? the balance organs, the feedback from our limbs, and our eyes ? if there there's any disagreement about what's going on, the result can be unpleasant. Dr Frank Golden of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution explains that sea sickness is caused when the central nervous system receives conflicting messages from these three systems.
