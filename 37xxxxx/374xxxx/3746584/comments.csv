,blaster999,2008-03-23T23:01Z,"I managed to find the track names. Here they are:

Ascending the tower;
mutual longing;
song of the sweetcake vendor;
reunion at the river of heaven;
returning vessel;
dream images of life;
floating lotus;
universal celebrations;
the song of silk pounding;
lyric from ping's garden;

Hope someone will find that useful ;)"

Here is the best track listing I can find.

,illusivechime,2010-04-26T09:57Z,"After comparing these traditional songs to other in my Koto collection, I was able to confirm the track listing below.

This audio recording definitely comes from the 1973 Vinyl ""Popular Koto Melodies Of Japan""

I have no idea where the name ""Chinese Masterpieces for the Cheng"" came from. It is completely wrong since these are ancient Japanese songs... So it seems there was a mixup from the original uploader, whatever source they may be contacted at is lost at this point. Here is a link to the wrong track listing for reference.
