There is an install file but it only works to 99%. But i can still play it using the bat file. Wierd."
[V],Subzero!,2007-07-26T07:48Z,"well i could have removed the install file, its in no way neccessary btw. it cant work 100% cause the game is already 100% installed...direct play!... look into bin folder there are 2 exe files , 1 of them is the one youre looking for i guess..."
