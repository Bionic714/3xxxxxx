,ohshow,2007-08-23T10:49Z,What a load of propaqanda scare tactic bullshit.
,duhprane,2007-08-25T19:20Z,"Yeah, do lots of meth you fucking moron"
,damon_dusk,2007-08-29T18:06Z,"Ya, you're right you fuckin schmuck. It's all scare tactic propoganda.......meth is actually a great source of vitamins and minerals, provides a shinier coat and clearer sight for your pets and will boost your childrens' rate of growth by 12%!!! The YEARS I spent wishing for death with a needle hanging out of my arm, helpless and without hope were actually a coma induced illusion brought on by the overflow of amazingly high quality substances being introduced to my system. How could I not have seen it all before!?!?!"
,sikki_nixx,2008-02-06T20:36Z,wow thanx alot Majsmumien...
,black427991,2008-04-09T04:35Z,"EVERYTHING IN MODERATION , AND YOU WILL LIVE A LONG HEALTHY LIFE, THE 70's and 80's were good to me."
,El.ivano,2008-08-28T15:38Z,"As long as the product is ""clean"" the hazards of meth are actually low in number...
But the problem is that the ""cookers"" prefer to produce shit, so they can make a  quicker buck...
Not taking in concideration the amount of harmfull chemicals produced as a side product of their poor lab-skills...
Unfortunatly i have to dissapoint damon_dusk; you will need an Electron Microscope to detect any vitamines in a chemically engineered product like Meth!
u, sir, r full of ..it"
,El.ivano,2008-08-28T15:42Z,"As for your comment about growth in children...
no comment,
i just hope you never get kids!
But you don't need  to worry.. your spermcount drops like a brick in water after just months of intensive Meth use..."
,_]osh42O,2008-09-06T17:53Z,"In less than 3 months my friend went from being a stacked 235 pounds goliath to a scrawny 140 pound twig with his cheek bones sunken in.

This drug is horrible!"
,Forfai,2008-09-22T00:52Z,"El.ivano, damon_dusk was being ironic.. he doesn't believe meth has vitamins or increases childrens growth rate.
Well, I think no-one can deny meth is one of the worst things you can put inside your body... and this comes from someone who wants to experiment with every single drug before he dies.. but this is not a drug.. it's pure poison"
,darousi,2008-09-26T04:05Z,well said forfai
,Tropius_B,2009-05-10T04:43Z,"You know that old saying ""NEVER TRUST A JUNKIE"".

Never trust a junkie's opinion about a drug, either. 

Never means NEVER - not even if they stop using for years.

If you want an opinion you can trust, it'll probably have to come from someone who used it but who wasn't so mentally fucked up already that it seemed like a bright idea to abuse the shit out of it. 

Of course, generally those people keep their opinions to themselves, because of the obvious social stigma and possible legal consequences of their experimentation... "
,krazy77,2009-05-28T23:08Z,"i used to do and cook  meth in every way possible. but thank god  and weed that i quit  everyone says its near immpossible to quit  thats bullshit .im a prime example iused to cook it ,shoot it eat it smoke it sell it and snort tons  theres dealers within 2 - 3 blks of my house in all directions and i still quit cold turkey with the help of weed of course . anytime i got ten dollars or anything worth money i walked straight to a dealer and then ran home and did it all  i did this for about 5 yrs  and then one day i just thought i wanted more out of life than that and never did it again and never answered the door to anyone with it   it was easy  im not saying that i dont think about doing it (that never goes away) or look down on anyone who does  but if u want to youll quit u just have to want 2   and what a post above says meth made right is not very harmfull each deadly part of chemicals is cancelled out by each procees of cooking  but the crap on the streets is just poison"
,LetsRockit01234,2010-01-27T05:11Z,"Meth is great, but these are tales of people who used it to escape and thus became addictive to it. Too bad this is the only side of the drug they display. Meth is good for short term use only! Definitely not for escape purposes and abuse or to become rich. Anyway, it helpws me in my weight loss endeavors and in cram/study/test times. Just my 2 cents."
,LetsRockit01234,2010-01-27T05:13Z,"I agree the stuff on the streets is poison, They should let doctors prescribe it with less hassle..."
,radger,2010-06-29T11:11Z,"The effects of methamphetamine... sigh.. i've been using meth for 6 years now. in the beginning i didn't realize wtf i was doing to myself. I've used it to accomplish all kinds of things i would have never in my wildest dreams achieved. But at the expense of my body and social relationships? Now there's 2 sides of me. The sober me who is like ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO YOURSELF... GOD DAMNIT THIS IS SERIOUS YOUR KILLING YOURSELF"" to the ""sleep's for bitches"" personality.. sigh.. People who have never used before need to stfu and realize you cant articulate what it's like to go thru what a meth addict goes through. It looks hopeless from the outside. But I'm not giving up.. Anybody who says any different can redirect your replys to /dev/null."
,ipontus,2012-08-28T16:26Z,Can you imagine Ritalin and Desoxyn (fancy name for meth) forcibly prescribed to 6 year old children under the direction of the school to make then sit still in a boring classroom and not invent something more interesting to do and show the other kids? Children being told that there is something wrong their thinking and they have an abnormal condition called hyperactivity? Then when I decided to take the bottle with me to school and give some to my hyper friends so they could get better too I got expelled and locked in a psychiatric ward for a month. They never told me it was dangerous or that I would suffer withdrawal symptoms when I was only 16 years old. Later I found out it was speed and was illegal! What am I to think but that we live in a hypocritical society of dope dealing doctors and junk psychiatry!
