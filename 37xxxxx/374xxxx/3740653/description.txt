The date is August 28, 1995. Thomas Veil, a photojournalist, has his identity erased by a mysterious conspiracy. His wife doesn't recognize him, the key to his house doesn't work, and his ATM cards are useless. People are chasing him, but he doesn't know why, except that it has something to do with "Hidden Agenda", a picture of an execution he took a year earlier that's missing from his studio. He has the negative, "they" want it, and the hunt is on. Tom Veil is hunting for the truth, while "they" are hunting him for the negative. 
This is one of the greatest shows ever made.
