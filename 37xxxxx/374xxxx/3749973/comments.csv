Thanks."
,fido_glc,2007-07-23T04:35Z,"Very good work ! Thank you ! It is the best formatted book so far. The text is arranged good, the page numbers are good, every page has a title, just like in the books and the font is very good, looks like the one in the real book.
The only thing I can reproach is that the prologue page is missing. It's not in any release (the page with the 2 quotes, the page after the contents).
Other than that, the only thing that I can think of that would make it better are front and back covers.
I think that this 2 would make this, not only the most complete, but a nearly perfect release and by far the best."
,fido_glc,2007-07-23T04:37Z,Pls let me know if you'll add my 2 suggestions. I have the printer ready.
,gobb1es,2007-07-23T04:55Z,"Thanks for the comments and suggestions, fido_glc. I originally planned on making it an exact copy off the book, but decided to keep it on a 8.5 x 11 page to make it easier to print. I plan on doing a complete spellcheck/proofread once I actually get to reading the book, along with some more additions, like the cover and back."

,gobb1es,2007-07-23T05:10Z,"kingofnaruto,
You must extract the .pdf and .nfo from the .rar file using a RAR extraction program. Then, you must have a PDF reader to view the file."

,gobb1es,2007-07-23T05:21Z,"kingofnaruto,
If you have already downloaded the file, get a RAR extracter, like WinRAR(http://www.rarlab.com/). Next, extract the files from the .rar. If you don't have Acrobat reader, get it here: http://www.adobe.com/products/reader/.

That should be all you need to know. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."
