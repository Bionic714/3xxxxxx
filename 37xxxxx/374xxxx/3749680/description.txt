Black Dragon aka Mr Canton and Lady Rose (Jackie Chan, 1989)

Avg. Rating:  	
  4.4 / 5 (based on 4 ratings).

Plot:	Jackie is a country boy who rescues a gangland boss and finds himself thrust from poverty into the center of the wealthy crime world of 1930s Hong Kong! But does his sudden fortune have something to do with a lucky rose given to him?

Overview:	Many consider Miracles to be Jackie's best movie. Stunning in every department, Miracles established Chan as a great director in addition to his already proven acting and martial arts abilities.

In this film, Jackie Chan is a good-hearted, down-at-heel youngster who finds himself in the wrong place at the right time. Overnight, he finds himself heading one of the biggest Triads in Hong Kong. Chan's basic decency sees him put his new power to good use. This is one of the most elegantly executed Chan's films, which manages to combines superb comerawork with his trademark fast-paced action antics. There aren't as many action sequences in this film. In fact, Jackie originally didn't want fighting scenes. However, realizing his fans would expect action, Chan brilliantly intertwined three incredible action pieces, the best being the final at a rope factory.

Throughout the 1980s, Chan was blasted by critics as someone who's only talent was directing and starring in lighthearted action films with little plot and substance. Chan took this criticism personally, creating Miracles, which was based on Frank Capra's "Pocketful of Miracles."
