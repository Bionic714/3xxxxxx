,thecardman23,2007-11-06T17:40Z,"theres nothing wrong with the movies.. if you just want to watch them.  but the problem is if you want to transcode them into dvd format or any other avi/wmn/.mov format besides the one their in now, it dosent work. (no idea why) i tried every prog i know and it cant decode the files. anyhow... if you just wanna watch them on your comp, they play fine. i used vlc media player and it opened them perfectly. "
