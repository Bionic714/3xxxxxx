All in one avi file with one audio stream. Funny stuff, I love it. If you watch this and enjoy it, and you have a job and/or money, you would be doing yourself and the world at large a favor by going to www.rifftrax.com and purchasing the license for the commentary for a mere $2.99. If they sell well they will continue to be made.

There is no way to turn the commentary off and just watch the movie. I can\'t see why you would want to though. Any fan of Star Trek or Mystery Science Theater 3000 or both should give this a try.
