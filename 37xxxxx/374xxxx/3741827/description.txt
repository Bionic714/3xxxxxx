OmniPass Client Edition 
Version 5 (Master Password module included)  
 
Strong User Authentication, Identity Management for Mobile and Desktop PCs. 
 
 
OmniPass Client Edition is a PC client application that can be used by consumers and enterprises to securely login to websites and applications (SSO) as well as protect data on a PC. The OmniPass Client Edition can also be used to secure e-mail, VPN and certificate private key access. Used standalone or in conjunction with strong authentication devices such as fingerprint readers or smart cards, OmniPass allows users to conveniently and securely forget about passwords and protect their data.


OmniPass also scales easily to an enterprise class solution which is integrated with Active Directory when used with OmniPass Enterprise Edition (click here for more info).


OmniPass supports multiple authentication devices and can be configured for multifactor authentication using any combination of authentication devices connected to the PC. The architecture of the OmniPass client Edition consists of a scalable and flexible â??OmniPass Subsystemâ?, which allows for virtually any type or class of authentication or storage device to be supported by the enterprise via an â??OmniPass Plug-Inâ? component. The enterprise can implement a certain security strategy today, for example biometrics or smart cards, but as an enterprise grows and business requirements change, support for new devices, such as Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chips or custom tokens, can be easily added.
