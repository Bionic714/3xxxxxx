His version of the game is a hack job cut scenes do not work properly. You cant see any characters or breakables after 10 seconds of each scene. GL timing your dodges."
,reginato,2007-09-15T21:56Z,"you re so stupid welcometothesuck,  why dont you read some comments from other torrents and site before post shits...   the problem with cutscenes happens with all games, its because the patch 1.10 increase the video quality...   you should download the patch video upgrade to fix it."
