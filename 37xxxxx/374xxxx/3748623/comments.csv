,Mod1Fy,2007-07-23T20:38Z,Thanks for the torrent dude.  But are you continuosly seeding now? because it looks you keep jumping off you've got to have at least someone else seeding before you stop for 3 weeks or this torrent will die.
,Jonakin,2007-07-23T22:15Z,"Thanks so much i've been looking for this since the day it came out.
And it does have everything in it like the normal dvd does right?
Has anyone downloaded it yet and hows the quality"

,Jonakin,2007-07-27T15:29Z,Omg how can it be downloaded 28 times and no one ever seeded ffs i've been stuck on 86% for 2 days
,stetilley,2007-07-27T20:36Z,"*sigh*
30 downloads and still no seeders
i'm just sat at 86% uploading, and even that isn't going very fast because EVERYONE is stuck at 86%
i hate torrents like this, i always seed when i finish downloading, that other people don't have the courtesy to do the same sucks"
,mickel900,2007-07-28T06:05Z,"Downloaded: 34 times 
Seeders: 1 
Leechers: 219 

COME ON PEOPLE, please seed,

i mean i am just using torrents now, and i was hoping that it would have gone faster than other ways i download.. so please, SEED"
,stetilley,2007-07-28T12:00Z,"simply put, this is bullshit
the unwritten law of seeding when you've finished leeching is being flaunted by 34 little bitches with no respect
i hope the federales come to their houses and arrest their asses for their ill-gotten downloads, i only ever torrent to see if it's worth buying something
if there's any way you can specifically choose to be seeding to me, i swear on my ever-rockin' life that i will seed for as long as it takes for other people to start seeding too"
,blind_eye,2007-07-30T16:10Z,pleez seed people!!!!i will when aim redy!!!
,thefrai,2007-07-31T03:33Z,"This is awesome... i'm stuck in 86.1%

,piratelucas,2007-08-01T09:58Z,"this is deadly!

,piratelucas,2007-08-01T15:54Z,"fuck this...

,JonoUK666,2007-08-01T17:53Z,"piratelucas you legend! say here when you get it up, i know a lot of people will be eager to use your torrent"

,JonoUK666,2007-08-02T19:16Z,ive just ordered the DVD  so when it arrives i will do my best to crack it if Piratelucas isnt able to. But i will seed wichever one goes up for a few hours per day after the 12th.
,Jonakin,2007-08-02T22:00Z,I dont get how its downloaded 64 times and it showed like 60 a few hours ago but i havent even moved 1% yet
,JonoUK666,2007-08-03T00:31Z,is it possible that the seeders are hinding themselves so that only selected ppl can download?
,DownByLaw,2007-08-03T04:34Z,how the hell is this possible!?! is seems to me that this has been a highly accomplished practical joke.
,mickel900,2007-08-03T13:05Z,"Well im new to this... but cant you add peers.. kinda thing. in BitTorrent.. its got tis add thing where the peers are... maybe like that im not sure..
but fuck

,JonoUK666,2007-08-03T13:27Z,"I now a guy that modded the code for a torrent client ( cant remembe wich 1) that allowed him to select a peer and up load to them at over 100 kb/s, the seed could be doing somthing like that"

,M.Shadows,2007-08-08T07:46Z,78 downloads and not one of those bastards has the decency to let the others seed of them. That pisses me off.
,DownByLaw,2007-08-08T09:43Z,"mickel900: what BT client do you use? Sounds like it may be a possible problem with you router. some routers have probs with P2P apps.
Check this out see if it helps.

,DownByLaw,2007-08-08T09:44Z,"Basically if it is a problem with connections due to your firewall it will help you configure your ports so that it will allow incoming/outgoing connections, hope that helps."
,mickel900,2007-08-08T11:10Z,"haha, i am smart with ports and stuff and done everything that i no.. which is alot... and like i went out for a bit.. left Bittorremt on.. and now its working.. i got peers and uploading.. strange.. lol hmm... come on people seed.. i just need 0.7% lol"

,xucphra,2009-02-10T23:01Z,"No reason to upload the ISO. The rar is basically the ISO, in a different format. 
Just mount the RAR using your virtual disc program, or unrar everything into a folder, and have your disc program mount all the content in that folder."
