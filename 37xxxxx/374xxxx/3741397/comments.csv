Jag håller me' dig. Alla ska klaga å klaga men vill man ha bra saker är väl bara skaffa sig på annat tex gå på bio. "
,Dustinthebastard,2007-07-18T15:51Z,Cam version allright... not too bad quality..thnx anyway
,Lightglow,2007-07-18T22:14Z,"This version of the film Transformers is indeed the best quality available atm, it?s a cam recording, but it is one of the best cam recordings I have ever seen.

Video gets a 7/10
Sound gets a 6/10"
,caio.car,2007-07-19T18:02Z,"This is a Movie version like a DVD?
Or a record in Theather !?

Thanks!
Caio"
,sesapup,2007-07-21T02:10Z,"Okay, use a little gray matter here....if it's a FIRST RUN movie still in the theaters, then it's probably a cam. If it's within about two weeks of DVD release, then you can get a DVD quality download, maybe without some of the extra features, but, heck it fits in a DVD5, right?

Deal with it. If it's not a cam, then the poster SHOULD let you know one way or the other. Most quality guys give a ton of info. "
,pipoworldwide,2007-07-22T08:27Z,"Nice download. Video/audio quality is 9/10 and 10/10. No DVD menu and no subs.
This download is much better comparded to "" Transformers.TS.XViD-20th"" (7/10 and 9/10). Also take a look at torrent ""Transformers.TS.DVDR-SWiNE""."
,drmcstroks,2007-07-24T19:19Z,"Picture- 6/10
Sound- 5/10

sides cut off, fairly dark"
,forroSacana,2007-08-08T02:49Z,"This topic, have sub in PORTUGUESE?"
,WebRat1964,2007-08-17T03:52Z,"this movie has no sound, don't download it, its a waste of time"
,Lalleglad,2007-09-22T15:38Z,"This film is poor quality, picture is cam and sound is like in a tin can"
