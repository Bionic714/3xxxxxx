o.O"
,MAJAR,2007-08-16T08:45Z,"This copy of PFConfig will work if purchase a registration code for only 29,95 at www.portfoward.com becouse you cant update router "
,motoxrdr21,2007-08-31T15:48Z,"People if you would stop and THINK for just one second you would realize the way around it checking the registration, simply unplug the WAN cable from your router than you have access to the router but not to the internet."
,pegbundy,2007-08-31T22:55Z,Al does not make enough money selling shoes for me to spend $30 buying this thing at this time. Is there another program I can get for free? I have read about the registration code being a problem here.
,IHWHI,2007-09-07T03:28Z,lemme see if i can crack it..if soo ill upload it

,adventurejunky,2007-10-26T02:25Z,how do you know if this works or not?
,KayeBeast,2007-10-26T14:12Z,"i was having trouble forwarding my ports, utorrnet kept telling me 'error port not forwarded' and all my download speeds were slow like under 5.0kb/s tried this pfconfig but couldnt find serial or crack. i downloaded hirens instead, theres a program in hirens called currports http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/cports.html . it shows you a list of all your local ports, i found the one for utorrent (4095 for me), changed utorrent port to 4095 and now my downloads are maxing at about 200kb/s. yes i am a happy man now. hope this helps anyone"
,jdiamond59,2007-10-29T15:42Z,"Unfortunately, the serial crack contained here is blacklisted and so won't work, even for those of us with some ""brain matter."" Anyone have a working serial for this? Thanks."
,purplepants35,2007-11-06T04:23Z,unpluging doesnt work it still doesnt work ive looked everywhere for years now never had any luck finding a working serial good luck guys finding one i dont think one exists or else i would have found it by now
,Spherez,2007-11-25T02:14Z,"You spent YEARS looking for one?

You would rather look for YEARS than to spend $30?

Incredible..."
,fjuulb,2007-11-26T19:31Z,use www.serials.ws usually works
,GYMMY,2007-12-13T22:30Z,"Why don't all you dumbass whiners spend your time learning how to configure your router yourself, instead of searching for a program to do it for you? If you can use bittorrent, you should be able to configure your own router, NOOBS."
,OnyxgrinD,2008-01-03T21:06Z,"@GYMMY

Why dont you actually give helpful information instead of whining about people whining. Not everyone has time to sit and troubleshoot routers all day."
,DSMeTailer,2008-01-03T21:39Z,"Well GYMMY, what the fuck were you doing on this page if you are such a port-forwarding expert?  You must have come here for a reason..."
,jjsasha,2008-01-21T13:38Z,"gymmy the whinny fuck.  hey gymmy  go fuck yourself .  your a fuckin noob pal !!!!!!  I swear i hate fuckin bitches like you!!!!! why the fuck dont you buy all your media and software and stay the fuck off torrent sites.  and learn how to spell jimmy too!!!! you fuckin CHRIST KILLER. gymmy the fuckin JEW!!!! your people love to make trouble for good people and you all love to put your big hook noses where they dont belong. then you have to bring up money (quite typical) and tell us to buy your buggy jew software....  please gymmy go bug Mcdonalds and demand that they make a kosher happy meal for your little terrorist kids and then go stick your jew claws in a poor arabs back and leave us alone....... but remember ""Jesus loves you"", even though you killed him...."
,FUCK_OFF_WEASEL,2008-01-26T07:17Z,"Yep, it does not wor, although I did not try to port forward with the WAN cable unplugged. Obviously, you will need to have the LAN cable plugged in to communicate with the router.  I bought the software since my router is in the supported router list.My speeds are faster, but not screaming (upped from 12 KB/Sec to 87 KB/Sec) Can port forward multiple programs, so I forwarded Bit Tornado too. Sometimes, it is worth it to buy software, this is one of those times. Since port forwarding is a BIG security compromise, this software makes it fast and easy to turn off the port forwarding, or switch ports on occasion. Fuck yeah buddy, let the downloading begin!"
,1devs,2008-04-11T09:50Z,Hey guys/gals this works great--->http://barracudaserver.com/products/tools/upnp/
,Davidbeats23,2008-04-19T05:55Z,fuckin fagot if this does not work then just serial or crack it suckers!
,FaustLeland,2008-04-26T01:52Z,none of the programs listed here work!
,ImPrettyMuchSexy,2008-05-13T23:28Z,Haha.. just port forward yourself. It's not like it takes more than 5 minutes.. gosh
,Etherian,2008-05-19T04:50Z,"Honestly, I've spent more time trying to download and get this for free than I ever will forwarding ports."
,AC2SURF,2008-06-30T09:01Z,warning virus virus virus thanks 4 nothin ass wipe
,pruttrick,2008-08-31T19:08Z,"the serial/username doesn't work, just saying that I should by the program"
,OneEyedBill,2008-09-09T21:31Z,It dosen't work it will let you install it and update the router list but when you try to forward ports it tells you to buy the licence
,husskii,2008-12-04T04:27Z,thnx this is the first one that actually downloads but legts see if it will work
,husskii,2008-12-04T04:41Z,this has no virus but wen u think its working it tells u to purchase a copy for port forwarding to work. how shit thnx for nufn man
,raindr0ps,2009-01-13T01:52Z,"Does your router or gateway support ""UPnP"" If so there is a shortcut for mapping ports. Here's how I do it; adapt it for you situation.

1. Log on to Actiontec GT704WG. 
2. Go to ""Advanced Setup""
3. Scroll down to ""UPnP"" (universal plug and play)
4. Check ""on"" and ""apply""
5. When screen returns to ""UPnP"" close window

1. Open utorrent.
2. Go to ""Preferences>Connection""
3. Make sure ""Enable UPnP port mapping"" and
    ""Add Windows Firewall exception"" are checked.
    I believe this requires Windows XP SP2
4. Click on ""apply"" and ""ok""
5. Close utorrent. Now utorrent will open and close
   ports as needed. 

Please don't flame me if this doesn't work for you,
it did for me but every computer system is different. 
If this didn't work but helped you to a solution please
post what you did and help out the next person.
If nothing works, you may be a candidate for
port forwarding program. One I haven't tried but would
have if this had caused me too many headaches is at
portforward.com. The small price ain't worth the
headache."
,XweAponX,2009-02-05T22:37Z,This proggy needs a CRAK not a fooking POS serial number that is blocked.
,aditya_ramlochan,2009-02-24T19:02Z,"it appears to work for a while then ask to buy it.
this is about the 10th torrent i downloaded and the same error. i would buy it cause it cheap but i cant  buy it so can some1 buy it and upload me the working serial my email is adityaramlochan@hotmail.com"
,dj_klyde,2009-03-25T23:54Z,"If I'm getting an average download speed of 180 and sometimes as fast as 300 kbs ... is there any reason to forward my ports?

will it make it any faster than that?  "
,dj_klyde,2009-04-08T02:10Z,"to tell ya the truth,

port forwarding is a pain in the ass. And it never increased my speeds. All it did was screw my shit up so bad that I had to completely uninstall utorrent and start all over with defaults just like i had it before.

THE ONLY WAY TO INCREASE DOWNLOAD SPEEDS IS TO FUCKING PAY FOR IT!!!!!!!

you can't get free bandwidth on TPB  ;)"
,SokolHacker,2009-05-27T13:52Z,DONT WORK
,x2rob,2009-07-13T18:10Z,"

,tpb_mvp,2009-08-18T21:19Z,raindr0ps' advice works for me. although i use a d-link dsl-2640t router. basically u have to assign ur pc a static ip & enable upnp on ur router & utorrent (upnp port mapping) & u r good 2 go.. if u r lucky. :)
,Sean5861,2010-01-09T04:21Z,"Working serial as of Jan '10:

,Haxs4Nubs,2010-04-06T02:46Z,Haha they caught on and it tells you how torrent users know that this is the program to use blah blah 29.95
,TheRealScrewtape,2010-11-26T07:05Z,"Way out of date, but still relevant: all of you brave, vicious internet blowhards should take your own long walk off a short pier. Some people who come here are unable to afford all the software they want, and some are so new to computers that they don't know as much as you rocket scientists. So get a life, then wash your mouths out with soap."
