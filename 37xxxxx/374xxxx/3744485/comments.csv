,camisadelgolf,2007-07-17T07:26Z,This is the first torrent I've ever published.  I hope someone enjoys it.
,ShadowMosesSP,2007-09-24T00:09Z,"I would, could you seed please?"
,camisadelgolf,2007-09-26T22:45Z,"I'm seeding, but it looks like no one else is, so it'll probably take you a long while to download this.  You can reach me on AIM as 'Nice and Passive' if you want me to send the albums individually."
,ShadowMosesSP,2007-10-18T01:23Z,"Hey bro I don't know if you're still seeding but I'm not seeing any seeders.
Also I've been checking AIM on and off for a while now and haven't seen you on.
I'm not complaining I'm just glad you're willing to share but if you want to get on AIM or something that'd be great."
,ElevatorT.M.,2008-01-22T04:20Z,"Welp, seeds for this would be amazing."
,mentallycreative,2008-03-25T20:50Z,"I'm certain that, if seeded, I will most certainly enjoy these albums."
,gmergoddess,2008-06-29T17:50Z,"This band is amazing. I have seen them live 5 times. I grew up in the Dayton music scene. I spent every weekend at a show loving the local music scene. Brainiac had the most amazing live show. Timmy Taylor was insane on stage. His death was felt all over the Dayton music scene. 

Ive lost a lot music over the years. I'd love to have these albums back."

,bakayurei,2008-11-21T16:01Z,well this has been a disappointment..
,Karnkraftsakerhet,2008-12-02T03:12Z,Has anyone had any success finding him/her on AIM? Definitely trying to get this torrent!
,Duke Dandy,2009-03-07T11:37Z,I would really love it if there was someone who could seeeeed! Thanks.
