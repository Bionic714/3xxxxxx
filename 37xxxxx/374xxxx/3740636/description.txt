CRITICA:
Amazon.com
As this 1999 Paris performance shows, Celine Dion's 
following is both global and bilingual: fully half of the 
songs in the 90-minute concert are sung in French, and they 
receive as loud a roar from the audience as the QuÃ©becois 
chanteuse's smash hits like "My Heart Will Go On." Dion's 
voice is a formidable instrument; it's too bad she feels 
compelled to press it into overuse in song after song. Much 
of her material lends itself to bombastic vocal 
treatment--"The Power of Love" and the concert opener, 
"Let's Talk About Love," come immediately to mind--and Dion 
certainly obliges, to the crowd's approving roars. It's 
obvious that the singer has a genuine love of performing for
 her fans, and that is her saving grace, even if her choice 
of material is not everyone's cup of tea. --Kevin Filipski
