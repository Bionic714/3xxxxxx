This is the NO INSTALLER NEEDED VERSION. Just unrar the folder.

If you prefer you can get the installer version here:

This version of the torrent is for those who complained that the installer didn't work for them. One problem is that it takes so long to unpack some huge files, and the installer doesn't provide a progress indicator. So, here's the rar no installer version. It still takes almost 6 minutes to unpack on my 950 Mhz machine, and I used the fastest compression setting. At least you'll get a good progress meter and hopefully a more stable install if you're having trouble, or just don't like installers or msi files. Of course you get no uninstaller or Start menu entries, which many see as a plus!

Instructions
unrar the file and put the resulting 2.08 GB folder somewhere. Don't let the path get too long.
Run Launcher.exe and ignore the error message, it won't come back.
Any more instructions are in the torrent.

[b]Built on a custom, upgraded, enhanced and tweaked version of the award winning Descent: Freespace 2 engine![/b]

1) The brand new TBP 3.4 final installer PLUS --->

2) EVERY other campaign and mission currently available for this excellent game! Totaling  17 single missions (includes training tutorial), 2 multiplayer missions, and 8 campaigns

""The Babylon Project"" takes the FreeSpace 2 SCP engine to another level and the screenshots don't do the gameplay justice. It has added greatly fun semi-Newtonian flight controls not found in Freespace:

Shift-3 = Slide Right
Shift-1 = Slide Left
Shift-Pad + = Slide up
Shift-Pad Enter = Slide Down
Alt G = Toggle Gliding

==========================================================
The keyboard map and manual are included, along with six training missions!
