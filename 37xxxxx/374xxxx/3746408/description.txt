CNN: Larry King Live: UFO COVER-Up Look to the Skies.  This was recorded on VHS and transfered to DVD-R with a DVD/VCR Combo Set Top Box Unit.  It was aired in the Mid 90\'s ( sorry i can\'t give a better date, but i\'m sure if you look around you can figure it out)...  If this one does good, i will up the other 2 i have recorded.  Used DVD Decrypter to get the video_ts folder files ready.  

That\'s bout it.

Lets all make the N.W.O. squirm and quiver at our attempts to over throw their \"Evil Empire\"...
