,dainvada,2007-08-02T18:46Z,"I dont have to justify to you why i stop seeding. I just did, what ever reasons i have wont matter to you."
,tomgmag,2007-08-09T22:20Z,"Hey dainvada. Totally respects your right to stop seed if you want to, but I would die (almost) to get hold of this. S2 almost complete and S1 at 52%. I humbly beg you to re-seed and I will keep those seeded for 24h once completed. "

,NewportNews,2007-10-16T17:59Z,"Those of you stuck at 99.9%, what file or files are incomplete? Maybe we can fix this torrent somehow."
,sopor42,2007-11-01T12:41Z,"I'm at 99.9% overall, but I think it's done

It's Episode 2 and 4, both missing 1 piece, 99.8%. I've got 327MB of episode 2, and 342MB of episode 4, and episode 2 plays fine, as far as I can tell..."
,NewportNews,2007-11-06T06:50Z,"The Season 2 torrent @ http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3742483/Ramsay_s_Kitchen_Nightmares_Season_2 has all of the season 1 episodes re-aired as 'revisited', so essentially you get the season 1 episodes with an update. I think this torrent is hopelessly stalled."
,soundwv,2007-11-07T01:36Z,"NewportNews is bloody right, yeah?

This F**in S01 is included in the F**in S02 entirely.

Bloody Hell!!"
,sopor42,2007-11-07T12:54Z,"Thanks NewportNews.  Honestly, the files play just fine anyway. So I'm all good either way"
,dkclark,2007-11-22T13:58Z,"Please seed.  I'm stuck at 99.9%, I will seed once I get the full download."
,Paradoxmaker,2007-11-23T18:22Z,Stuck at 99.86% for 3 days....Seriously WTF????
,Pilie,2007-12-19T02:42Z,"""NewportNews is bloody right, yeah?

This F**in S01 is included in the F**in S02 entirely.

Bloody Hell!!""

No it's not. The last four episodes of season 2 are visits to the same restaurants as in season 1, but after some time has passed. That's why they're called ""Revisited"". Much of the material is the same, true, but there is quite a bit of follow-up stuff so it's not the same ep over again."
,Pilie,2007-12-19T23:55Z,"Oh - and could anyone please seed this even for a day or two? There are more than 60 of us stuck at 99.9%, waiting for that last 0.1% for a couple of weeks now.

Please seed!"
,Byronchenko,2007-12-21T11:35Z,"Hi,

I've got the same 99.9% problem, however, if you play the video files with VLC Media Player (google it? I'm not sure of a direct link) it'll play them anyway. No idea about dvd burning, but that works for me.."
,moshu,2007-12-30T05:30Z,99.9% for over 4 days now... 30th of december
,jiggasintown,2008-01-03T21:21Z,Please Please Seed For the last 0.1% and ill help continuing seeding. If not anyone know where i can get another version of series 1??? Thanks
