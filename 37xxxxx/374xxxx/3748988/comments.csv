,digitalwi,2008-05-10T01:25Z,"Excuse me, but how is this a ""paedo"" post? Ok:
1. The girl is 18+
2.  Even if she was under 18, doesnt make the poster a pedophile. Pedophile is an attraction to pre-pubescent girls or boys. You, Sir, are a troll. "
,red456,2008-07-13T00:28Z,"i didn't say ""pedo"", did I? I said ""paedo"".
go practice your latin"
,digitalwi,2008-09-02T20:58Z,"Im not the one that needs practice: 

Actually, pedo is a derivation of latin word ""paedo"", while means children. Therehence, a pedopobic person has a fear of children. More correctly, this is spelled and pronounced paedo, not pedo, which is a form of transport.
