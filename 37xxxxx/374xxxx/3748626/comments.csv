,puggdogg,2008-04-23T07:43Z,Sorry everyone. I forgot I was ever seeding this. I'm trying to start it up again but I'm not not sure if it'll work because I haven't had much experience with seeding my own files. I don't even know if I've done it correctly. :)
,puggdogg,2008-04-24T15:48Z,I DON'T KNOW HOW TO RE-SEED IT SO I'VE MADE A NEW TORRENT!
