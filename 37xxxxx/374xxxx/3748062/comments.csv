,RogueJuggalo,2007-07-22T00:16Z,Thanx. I have been trying to find these videos for awhile now.
,nordgrimm,2007-11-28T11:45Z,Can someone please seed. I promise I will have this gem on my seed list for a very long time if I can download it.
,herkamire,2007-12-04T21:09Z,I've heard that some bittorrent clients allow you to download only certain files. Perhaps BitLord?
,Poonberry,2008-01-08T12:57Z,please keep seeding !!
,freakindawg,2008-03-19T14:20Z,"I watched the first one and almost fell asleep. This guy is so uneloquent when he speaks, it takes a few rewinds to get his meaning. A good summary of the Power of Myth could be found in a much better format in the book ""King, Warrior, Magician, Lover"" by Robert Moore and Douglas Gillette. 

It's actually about redscovering the archetypes of the mature masculine but at least it isn't like listening to two guys on LSD discussing in psychobabble..

Thumbs down on this one. Waste of bandwidth."
,20thvole,2008-11-04T03:09Z,"This is possibly the greatest thing ever shown on  television. Watching Bill Moyers since the recording of this series you can see the profound effect Campbell had on him. In this interview/documentary Joseph Campbell really cuts through the bullshit dogma of traditional christian interpretation and helps us understand the way religious texts were meant to be read, as stories and poetry attempting to describe the indescribable, not as literal dictation.
enjoy this and follow your bliss and/or blisters  "
,eric235u,2008-12-02T03:35Z,many thanks for this most informative upload.  an example of how the bittorrent protocol and thepiratebay.org can enrich our lives.
,zackary87kr,2009-03-09T15:34Z,Thank you very much for this upload! I passionately enjoyed the book many years ago and have yet to watch the TV series!

^ Lol....Wow. Freakindawg, your genius is staggering!

But seriously...If you haven't seen this series - get it now. Without question, it's one of the most fascinating interviews ever broadcast. 

Thanks a lot for the upload, ionquest!"
,libertaswv,2009-07-06T03:29Z,"Sorry....I forgot to mock ""uneloquent ""....lol....i shake my head in disbelief.  Normally grammer/spelling mistakes should be ignored, imo, but under the circumstances....Geezus, freakindawg - are you freakinserious?? 

'Skip this series because the speaker is ""so uneloquent"" '

wow."
,Lovsong,2010-10-15T04:43Z,Thank you cosmos for making this series available here.  What a gem!  This series should be mandatory watching for students of all ages.
,crookedtree,2011-10-22T02:32Z,Hey ionquest123 thanks so much for this! I watched the entire series back when it first came out and I can honestly say that it changed my life.
