The Power Of Myth

The Power of Myth is a book and six part television documentary first broadcast on PBS in 1988 as Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth. The documentary comprises six one-hour conversations between mythologist Joseph Campbell and journalist Bill Moyers.

The interviews were filmed at George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch during the final two summers of Campbell's life (the series was broadcast on television a year after his death).
