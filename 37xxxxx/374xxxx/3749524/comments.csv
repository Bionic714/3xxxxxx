,dhawald3,2007-07-22T18:54Z,"The right way to go man!

Stephen Fry beats jim dale hands down.

Jim dale tries to act out the book, but Stephen Fry READS the book which is more important."
,Hjulben,2007-07-22T19:53Z,The biggest and fatest thanks of all!!!

,Exige001,2007-07-22T23:04Z,"I grabbed the Rapid Share Files.  I am currently seeding at 39.1% complete.

NOTE:  You can extract the files if you combine them together first then use WinACE or something similar to extract the files that aren't corrupted.

Would really appreciate more file from Rapid Share.  I will continue to seed."
