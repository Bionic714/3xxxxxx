,shikotee,2008-11-12T19:28Z,Am dl-ing all 5 discs. Any chance that S2 discs could be reseeded?
,drronin112,2009-01-15T06:19Z,"Looks like Seasons 2 & 3 Have no Seeders anymore. Which is a Shame because I love the Season 4 with Menus I got from Blacknoon. 
I did get an average of 20 Some MB on the Season 2 and 3 Downloads From Blacknoon here (The ones that downloaded any at all), then they all just kinda stopped.  And I notice Season 2 disk 2 both have comments that their not being seeded anymore.  Makes me a Sad Panda, Blacknoon does great work."
