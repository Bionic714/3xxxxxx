,idkwtftoput,2007-07-24T14:19Z,"I wanna know where the readme files are at, they ain't in the folders, and not in the .rar files.. so where are they?"
,Kexofil,2007-07-29T18:23Z,"This is a waste of time, the nfo says to unrar halflife 2 and css. Css, however, isn't included, wich causes the installer not to work since it needs the css gcf to work."
