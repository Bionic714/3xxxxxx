The real deal folks."
,Alexbungle,2007-07-13T02:13Z,"is it the same one has this one ?
Harry.Potter.2007.CAM.Xvid.INTERNAL-JJ02"
,tonisidana,2007-07-13T02:18Z,"Yes, this is real
Thanks."
,margatenj,2007-07-13T02:27Z,"This version of HP has no sample ... any cam w/o a sample is 99% of the time unwatchable.  I'd rather NOT watch a bad copy of a movie, it spoils it, what good is a movie filled with FX if you can not see/hear whats going on.  

Also if you only download the sample and it doesn't have and dark screens in the sample, don't bother. 

The film makers know to make a lot of dark screens because they're a bitch to capture with a camera... and all HP have a lot of dark screens."
,Alexbungle,2007-07-13T02:35Z,thank you for the moral lecture ... but I think the people here know what to expect 
,ScorpDan,2007-07-13T02:40Z,hopefully this one is better tha nthe JJ02 copy.  the JJ02 copy has 15% of the top screen missing.  badly cropped.. Here's Hoping this one is better.
,Alexbungle,2007-07-13T02:44Z,I think it is the exact same file but split in 2 cd....  correct me if I'm  wrong
,ErEf,2007-07-13T03:19Z,"yea, a group is dead for almost a year and releases harry potter, NO.
FAKE.
 the jj20 thingy was an internal since it misses most of the footage.
no ""real"" release yet"
,SOLARIES666,2007-07-13T04:06Z,"its not a fake but is pretty ugly sounding/looking
if your bent on watching a cam might wait a few more days.. IMHO  


I dont mind cams myself if there are no heads or hands in the frame :P"
,ScorpDan,2007-07-13T05:55Z,terrible copy of the movie.. don't waste your time. wait for a better release
,Gorey,2007-07-13T11:04Z,Seeda !!!
,Krille152,2007-07-13T12:36Z,"thx for the upload correeeectly...

,hpavc,2007-07-13T20:25Z,"lol, same screen shots for different copies."
,quasarcaraway,2007-07-14T03:35Z,"sorry i'm new, but how do you convert the files like cd1.r00 etc into a viewable format? i'm using a mac, if that helps."
,Effrem71,2007-07-14T10:37Z,"Mac users need RarX
Windoze users need winrar

This is in .rar format just google or versiontracker it"
,jakesnake100,2007-07-14T12:12Z,VERY VERY VERY BAD QUALITY  ALLMOST UNWATCHABLE
,Shareefa,2007-07-14T13:58Z,This sucks. Im not even going to watch it through
,snuskmumrik,2007-07-14T20:42Z,REAL CAM?? can it be a fake cam? a toy cam?  an imaginary cam? hohoho..
,jgabriel,2007-07-14T22:14Z,"quasarcaraway: ""sorry i'm new, but how do you convert the files like cd1.r00 etc into a viewable format?""

Google Rar or WinRar (MacRAR?), find a suitable Rar decompressor, download, install, and use it to decompress the file.

,Dragon.76,2007-07-14T22:17Z,"From the very start with tons of people talking over the movie this bites.  I watched 30 seconds.  aspect ratio is all off.  With all those people talking, see why it's not worth the money to pay to see it in a theatre?"
,hazman102,2007-07-14T22:34Z,"this is terrible has funny crosses in it and fades out every half an hour and says the end, but it gets worse its not even the whole film the ending is missing so if you dont want to spoil it DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT"
,jmmcriddick,2007-07-15T13:28Z,"fist 5 minutes the camera man is having the shacks then it goes blank for a minutes and the top of the film is missing 
do you you could it writhe some times or should we just wait until axxo puts them up ????????????????????????????????????????????????"
,lovellyvee,2007-07-15T23:06Z,"i think i found a better release on mininova
Harry Potter 2007-TS_U4E-pnworld.biz"
,skategirl,2007-07-17T12:49Z,"Where I would be able to download this film with a distinguished sound and in a good quality? 
Much torrentet tried, and his majority is shit."
,zomgkittylazerz,2007-07-17T23:22Z,"I can't believe thousands of people are wasting their first time watching such an incredibly bad quality cam. You only have one chance to really watch the movie, I'd rather work and go to the theater or AT LEAST wait for a non-cam release."
,bendowling,2007-07-19T19:43Z,"There are much better quality copies of this available. This one is BAD. Do a search on flixflux, quite a few copies out now."
