,Bananturbo!,2007-07-25T17:06Z,"Thanks :) Everything seem to work fine

@chricco
When you exec ""Winrar 3.70 and Key.exe"" just press install. Now it will have extracted two files in the same folder as you had ""Winrar 3.70 and Key.exe"" in.
Just install winrar with the exe and drop the key file wherever you installed winrar"
,dongstra,2007-07-26T08:23Z,Programma werkt prima. 
,cybertrollet,2007-07-27T23:59Z,"It works OK.

,Artymonn,2007-11-11T11:31Z,"Download this only to get the keygen.exe which is actually just registers the product. Trash the program itself !!!! Norton picks it up as a virus no matter what machine I try to run it from. Just search the Internet for the new Winrar 3.71 from rar.com I think and run the ""keygen"" once it is installed. After you do, your Winrar 3.71 will be registered and ready to go."
,sardwyn,2007-11-12T01:48Z,Excellent torrent. Thanks for this. Works as intended ppl. Just drop winreg.key into the winrar folder and its a free 15user license for yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeewz :p
