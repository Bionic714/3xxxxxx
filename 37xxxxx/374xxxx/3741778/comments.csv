If you want to stay loyal to the good ol' Pirate Bay then check out JF's upload, which is ~ 90M smaller but still reported to work just fine.  What the difference is, I have no clue.  I am downloading both regardless.

I am having trouble locating the license.dat file to delete and replace, I tried the above mentioned method with no results, any other suggestions? In the finder search textbox I typed the following and came up with 0 results is this right: Command + Shift + G /Library/Frameworks/Maple.framework/Versions/11/license/      .Anyone who got this to work your help would be much appreciated."
