,tespio,2007-07-20T13:16Z,You are free to NOT download. It is the real deal. If you do not have concrete informations do not throw the rock.
,tespio,2007-07-20T13:44Z,"For the record and for anyone else. I am currently uploading with over 1.3 Mb/s. There are several finished uploads. If some of those that got all the file can backup me and confirm the movie is an excellent quality i would apreciate. 

Best Regards"

,knvb1123,2007-07-23T07:00Z,"You guys. This works. I'm on a mac and with VLC player it works fine. The quality is good enough to watch on a 20"" screen. The sound quality is good enough to watch also. I mean the quality isn't like HDDVD but its good enough to watch. Definitely worth the download and I miraculously finished the download within 2 hours. Good seeding! Keep up the work."
