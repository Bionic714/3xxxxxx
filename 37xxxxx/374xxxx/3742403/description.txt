The other torrent for Gumiho is a rotten multi-file rar archive, worthless for previewing, and trying to save space by compressing already compressed data. This one's much better, and even comes with a nice script for running the movie. It was built as a labor of love from the other rotten torrent, so it's the identical movie. Just in a better format.
