,Jackass Jimm,2007-07-17T00:33Z,"the problem is that these files DO NOT NEED to be rar'ed (or zipped).  And if they are, then make one rar or zip file.  I, honestly, also hate the whole thing of having multiple .rar files for no apparent reason."
,farsyly,2008-05-18T00:55Z,"There may no longer be an apparent reason but in the past there has been. Prior to bittorrent when people still used FTP, Hotline, etc.. hash functions where not the norm, so having corrupted downloads was a big problem. RARing alleviated this problem. Instead of corrupting the entire download, only the single chunk would be corrupted, and in turn could be re-download. Instead of 700MB re-downloaded, it would be a 14MB chunk re-downloaded. See the rational?

The other reason to RAR would be if your a prick that tries to profiteer from people wanting a particular ware/movie/game, but compressing, requiring a password, and redirecting to a sign up website that makes them add revenue if you fill in vitals, fake or not.

It may be unnecessary with Bittorrent but often this files will spread to other networks that do still benefit from the practical fix to no real time hashing.

My advice? Deal with it. You get the stuff for free, and the people who do it are the old time ripping groups that know the above and more.
