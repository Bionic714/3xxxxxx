,Armstrong_,2007-07-18T02:22Z,Same as all the other picture versions but combined into a single pdf file.
,attanasi0,2007-07-18T02:24Z,"is it all the pictures in a pdf or is it the whole text retyped in .pdf ? 
Someone should really retype all the text in .pdf or .doc format so that people could send it to printers. "
,SisterRaysaid,2007-07-18T02:27Z,"This is the same thing as the other versions, just the photo's. Not easier to read at all. 

Doubting its a fake, book is 759 numbered pages, 15 various others seems likely. "
,attanasi0,2007-07-18T02:33Z,"you're right, just finished downloading it. Is there a text version somewhere because it isn't easy to read at all."
,kitfox69,2007-07-18T02:34Z,Learn to add that would be 25 more. Also page count means only numbered pages that contain story line... check amazon to confirm this for other potter books. Says paperback azkaban ends at 870 and sure enough last page of story is 870 then we get the rest of the authors pages on top of that.
,attanasi0,2007-07-18T02:36Z,"It's legit guys, why would someone take the the time to photoshop all that, now all we need is a text or printer-friendly version !"
,nasarius,2007-07-18T02:39Z,"Uh...are you seriously claiming that this is a fake just because the page count is slightly off? Someone would mean went through a *lot* of trouble to perfectly duplicate Scholastic's printing style, not to mention JKR's writing. ""Elaborate"" is a massive understatement."
,kitfox69,2007-07-18T02:50Z,Idiots. Do any of you own hardback first editions put out by scholastic??? The page edges are NEVER EVEN. That is what sets them apart from the reprints. And yes i do believe someone would go through all this trouble just to leak a fake... look at all the hype. Also why else would Scholastic be persuing the culprit on FRAUD charges rather than copyright infringement. Personnaly i think J. K. may have had a hand in this.
,clan_viking,2007-07-18T02:50Z,I doubt Rowling would go so much OOC so I would say Fake.

Kudos to the fakers, though, they're still way cooler people than me! I'll bet they really wrote, edited, printed and bound it. Beautiful!"""
,daniel9,2007-07-18T05:00Z,just becuz it is near the length the book is supposed to be doesnt mean its real! this has happened the last time a potter book came out. something leaking which was around the same amount of pages and it ended up being fake. and just becuz its pics taken of pages inside of a book doesnt mean a thing in this age of technology
,daniel9,2007-07-18T05:17Z,"actually companies have gone thru extraordinary measures to take down fake versions of things in the past. what scholastic and bloomsbury are doing is of no surprise and is something that should be expected. think about it from the corporate point of view. would u want someone getting a fake version. a fake version i might add which could possibly push ppl to cancel their orders or not buy the book at all. so from a monetary/corporate point of view. it is an expected move. now then another funny thing is rowling herself has yet to comment on this leak. but when other books have leaked before the rel date, the authors usually had comments. all we have seen so far is everyone but the author commenting. one can imagine what rowling is doing with so many ppl thinking this is the real thing. more than likely she is laughing. laughing loudly at the fans who cant recognize what is her work and what is fanfic."

""Auntie Muriel, who seemed to be enjoying herself *hugely*, snapped her fingers for more champagne.""

To my knowledge, the word 'hugely' does not exist. Surely, a book as anticipated as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows would have been edited multiple times, and this would have certainly been picked up.

Some obsessed fan has obviously tried to make this look as realistic as possible. Shame they forgot to fix that mistake."

Benzo, the English language is infinitely extensible through modifiers like ""re-"", ""pre-"", ""post-"", ""-ly"", ""-ic"", ""-ish"", etc.

They're all correct, though some forms are more acceptable than others, and those forms may vary depending on whether you're speaking English in, say, the US or England. And it doesn't matter whether they appear in the dictionary or not.

And really, you're gonna complain about 'hugely' while skipping 'disapparated' or 'commentated'? Or 'nargle'?

,ruffus161,2007-07-18T16:35Z,"this is not the real book
i read it all, and it really really seems legit, but there is one thing that it does not explain, namely this cover image:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_US_Full.jpg; 

also it seems to just cover all the theories too much, it tries to much to cover all the theories, and all the fan questions like the death of dumbledore, why did he have ames's cloack, it shows a somewhat odd story about why is snape good; harry is a horcrux... 
just doesn't seem legit after all of this; 
but maybe i am mistaken;
if any1 could figure out where that book cover is in the book, let me know , pls.
otherwise, it is a very good read, 
but dissappointing;
and i do hope this is not the real book, because it is too dissapoining to be it..."
,Eruvatar,2007-07-18T18:20Z,"Either Rowling has made a big mistake, or this is a clear fake.   Take a look at this paragrap: ""?The Trace, the Trace!? said Mad-Eye impatiently. ?The charm that detects magical activity around under-seventeens, the way the Ministry finds out about underage magic!""

The Half Blood Prince clearly states that the ministry can only trace magic performed at a spesific location, not by whom it is performed.  Or they would have known that Harry could not have performed the charm that cost him an official warning when Dobby went mental. 

Also, they would have proof that Harry was indeed innocent in conjuring the Dark Mark in GoF. 

The ""trace"" of wich Mood-Eye speeks in this ""leak"", does not exist and that means this release is fake.   A really, really, really good fake, but still a fake. "
,bdc52004,2007-07-18T18:31Z,"I have hard time believing this is real since Mesozder states that Dumbeldore is alive. JK has stated several times that is not alive and it is not a trick. He infact is dead.

This is from Muggelnet.com from an interview they did with JK-

 ""Dumbledore IS really dead. ""Everyone needs to move through the five stages of grief"" and get past his death. She also apologizes to DumbledoreIsNotDead.com for ruining the purpose of their site.""

So with saying he is alive would lead me to believe this is a good fake.

But also, the wikipedia article on this book (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows) has a list of things that Rowling herself has said would be in it, and as far as I can tell, they're not all in this version. For example, that a ""non-magical character will perform magic late in life under desperate circumstances."" Don't think I saw that (please correct me if I'm wrong). Or that the flying Ford Anglia would reappear (it was mentioned, but didn't actually reappear). Or that Ginny would prove to be extremely powerful. (She didn't do squat in this book.) Et cetera.

Anyway. It would be an enormous waste of time to create an entire huge fake book just to yank people's chains, but I'm still hoping for something different on Saturday..."

,bam_himself,2007-07-20T16:04Z,"One way to see if this is a fake or not is to see if it contains this:
