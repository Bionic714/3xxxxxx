,Blarghargh,2007-07-19T21:10Z,"For clarification purposes, the people who did the first 10 chapters [DSB] are not associated with those who did the currently standing 11-21 [GQCustoms], and thus their work should not be associated with each other in any way, nor should any one group be credited for this particular compilation."

,splice42,2007-07-19T22:23Z,"Don't bother with shadowpwner's link, it's the chapters 1-10 that have already been posted, and that are in fact contained in this very torrent.

Poor fucking effort."
,fido_glc,2007-07-19T22:50Z,Couldn't you have just formatted the text so that it all of it is the same ?
,Dan7712,2007-07-20T00:38Z,Yeah - If you changed both the text format to times new roman or arial it would have been a lot better!
,motoxrdr21,2007-07-20T15:37Z,this is the same exact content as the photo versions that everyone including myself is claiming as a fake!!

A fake photo version of a book?
It would be very difficult to publish a fake book just to take photos of it!"
,scrapsoflife,2007-08-25T05:26Z,I love it when the skeptics are proven wrong. It's just so satisfying... :D
