,Ã¤lskarsara,2007-07-18T07:11Z,it's just the first 10 chapters. you could at least have written that in the info
,Sharking,2007-07-18T07:19Z,"that is the file name, axlskarasehss.

This is a good one, but im not sure if its legit. Im downloading the other PDF version to make sure"
,curexcult,2007-07-18T07:24Z,has anyone seen this one before? if it is yet another fan fic or is this one new to everyone with the slim possibility of it being the real deal?
,vadche,2007-07-18T07:25Z,"This is legit

First 10 chapters only however"
,mcarb,2007-07-18T07:44Z,thanks

  ""Tusentals personer kommer att köa utanför bokaffärerna på lördag. Många av dem kommer omedelbart att bläddra till sista sidan för att kolla om den lilla trollkarlen överlevt J K Rowlings penna.
  Men internets trollkonstnärer hann före. I förrgår lades hela boken ut på flera piratsajter.
Men ingen vet om kopian är äkta. Den slutar nämligen inte med ordet ?scar? ? utan med ?lifetime? (livstid). Och i epilogen, om man vill se den som slutet, lyder sista meningen ?allt var bra?.""

finns ""hela ute""?"
,jgabriel,2007-07-18T09:03Z,"At first I didn't think this was real, because it was so small. 

Anyway, yes, it's real. It's typed up from the JPG's into text and converted to PDF.

As already noted, though, it's only the first 10 chapters. My guess is that they need more transcribers, and putting out the first ten chapters is a good way to show people what they're doing.

And it gives us something to read while waiting for the next 10 chapters, or the whole book, however they decide to put out the next release.

,jgabriel,2007-07-18T10:49Z,"Dude. You're joking, right?

They're transcribing this as fast as they can from the JPG's that were released earlier. 

So, you know, not all of the formatting niceties are going to be there. For instance, so far I've found about half a dozen typos -- things like 'displaces' for 'displeases' or 'one' for 'none'. Deal with it.

Or not. Your call, really.

But complaining about it, especially since they're doing this for free, is pretty fucking ingracious. If'n you ask me.

,Eruvatar,2007-07-18T18:24Z,"Either Rowling has made a big mistake, or this is a clear fake. Take a look at this paragrap: ""?The Trace, the Trace!? said Mad-Eye impatiently. ?The charm that detects magical activity around under-seventeens, the way the Ministry finds out about underage magic!""

The Half Blood Prince clearly states that the ministry can only trace magic performed at a spesific location, not by whom it is performed. Or they would have known that Harry could not have performed the charm that cost him an official warning when Dobby went mental.

Also, they would have proof that Harry was indeed innocent in conjuring the Dark Mark in GoF.

The ""trace"" of wich Mood-Eye speeks in this ""leak"", does not exist and that means this release is fake. A really, really, really good fake, but still a fake."
,Enpåtygga,2007-07-18T18:26Z,"how long till the rest is uploaded?
great work btw..."
,ridge87701,2007-07-18T19:04Z,"No it isn't a fake. There are a few more mistakes, which are either intentional or deliberate.
There are talks about the Mother's Protection on the House.
On the HOUSE? When did Lily Potter protect the house? Specially since it was protected only AFTER the Potters died. 
And as was clear in GOF, Mother's charm was broken after the resurrection of Darklord, involving HPs blood. Voldermort clearly said that the charm is broken and he even touched Harry to prove that.

So... Whats going on Ms. Rowling?

Mistakes aside, it is fortunately/unfortunaltely the real deal.
Check out any one of the 72MB torrent containing all pages pictured.
THAT would be a HUGE effort for someone to fake.
Why not simply put text or pdf like hundreds of other fakes/fan-fiction?

So Bowbow98 when are you coming up with the rest of the pages?"

suppose it is a hoax - then it is still some very interesting writing! it sure feels authentic, with its smart references to the previous books, consistent characters and fluent, straightforward style (try reading some of the best fan fiction and you'll see it doesn't compare with this text). 

the mistakes mentioned above need some careful studying - it seems there is space to interpret the mentioned passages in more than one way? i'd like to see the exact passages that contradict each other."
,ridge87701,2007-07-18T20:57Z,"True. You can get a Billion Dollar Security, but the fact remains that it's a book, which is about to be released in 2 days time, hence atleast a hundred million copies have already been printed.
That too in hundreds if not thousand parts of the world.
Its almost impossible to prevent a leak. Specially such a high profiled one.
You're from India, and you wonder about leak?
Just imagine, the book is also about to be launched in Bihar, so many copies are already shipped there. Is it so difficult to pull one out from Bihar ;-) Just an example, most people NOT from India might not grasp.

Anyway, yes, I agree with HP7reader, if its a fake, then the person who wrote this should start a series of his/her own.
Too many new names, new concepts and and old links, for it to be a fake.
Also the detailed info about Horcruxes etc. can only be given by the writer who originally thought of it. So probably it IS the real one."
,ridge87701,2007-07-18T21:07Z,"yeah man. Yorkshire, Colarado, Bihar, Lalukhet, Kabul, the list is literally endless.

Uh, actually, it's 12 million.

Not that it changes your argument. 12 Million is still a hell of a lot of books. Just wanted to make sure you had the right facts to support it.

Right. So I guess, what you're saying is, that J.K. was remaining politically correct when she replaced the word Christmas with...Christmas; or, is it possible that I misread Sirius as being Harry's Dogfather, instead of his Godfather? I mean, his nickname was Padfoot, so there's a good chance I might have misunderstood... Or, the more likely possibility, is that you've got no clue what you're talking about."
