,kitfox69,2007-07-18T02:29Z,This is an elaborate fake as it ends on page 759 and the US version has been confirmed at 784. Also this book is registered at the Library of Congress under Joanne Kathleen Rowling whereas all the other potter books are registered to J. K. Rowling.

Doesn't sounds like J.K."
,javabytes87,2007-07-18T06:35Z,"Got news for you. Not a fake. Count the pages, not just the numbered ones. Comes out to exactly 784 pages. This is the real deal."
,javabytes87,2007-07-18T06:37Z,"BBu, Rowling has written passages like that in the sixth book as well, dealing with Merope. If you're basing your claims of validity on your poor recognition and recollection of J.K. Rowling's writing style, nobody wants to hear it."
