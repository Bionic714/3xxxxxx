This is just a message to some Elvis fans, not the actual torrent file.

The full torrent can be found by typing in the search box "Elvis - A Profile- The King On Stage" without his last name  "Presley".    Many people type "elvis presley" in the search box,  but not "elvis".   By doing this,  they miss out on  some torrents that way.    Or click on my uploader id  "sek1835"  and the torrent will be in my list of uploads.  The one with 2.16 GB has the music and covers.

The reason for this message is that some of my friends told me they could not find this torrent.  They typed in Elvis Presley in search box, not Elvis.

If you do download the torrent,  please, please seed it.   2.16 GB is too much for my slow upload speed alone.
