,FrIeK,2007-07-28T23:45Z,I cannot agree more with clintox. this is a super great album. Cannot wait to buy it. Support KoRn by buying there cd's. So they can keep making the best music ever:-D
,Elegy,2007-07-30T04:38Z,"This is a horrible album! Can't believe that one of my former favourite bands has evolved into what I would call alternative pop. This album is just as bad as the new one from Linkin Park.

Stop calling these bands hard rock, its embarrasing. 

If you want good music listen to KoRns old stuff!"
