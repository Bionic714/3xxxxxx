,Backpacker216,2007-07-21T00:58Z,Thanks for the upload.  This is a great classic!
,jester45,2007-07-21T08:51Z,typo? or scam? 43 hours or 43 minutes ?
,Lorimar,2007-07-21T14:11Z,"Neither typo nor scam. 
It is a 43 hour reading of the unabridged version of the book. Audio books of this length are not common, but there are quite a few out there."
,Lorimar,2007-07-22T17:19Z,"The audio sounds clear. A slight quality difference is discernable between these and the original, but they still sound good. No worries.

Bitrate   : VBR (32-48 kbps)
Samplerate: 44100
Mode      : Stereo
Quality   : Voice

If I encode future releases in joint stereo will the output size be smaller?"
,Lorimar,2007-07-22T17:33Z,To answer my own queston . . . No.  :|
