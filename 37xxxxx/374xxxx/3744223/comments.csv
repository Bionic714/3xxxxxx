,bhere4u,2007-07-17T13:51Z,Any chance for you to start seeding?
,bhere4u,2007-07-23T23:15Z,"Hey macchiato!
After six and a half day, a bunch of +20 people have downloaded 55,6% of your torrent ""Dedales"". But now nothing more is happening. What's up man (or woman)?
If you write that we should see this version before the american version (""Labyrinth""), I'll hope you start seeding again!!! - A big, big ;-)"
,macchiato,2007-07-24T23:04Z,"Dunno why the speed is so slow. I have it on high-priority. Unfortunately I can't seed 24/7 and don't have the fastest connection but I'll make sure it is seeded fully. If you can't wait go rent it, it should only cost like 3?."
,bhere4u,2007-07-25T10:20Z,"Something must be wrong. Hope you fix it, or I try at the nearest videostore."
,macchiato,2007-07-29T02:14Z,It's been downloaded two times. Hit n' runners where are you?
