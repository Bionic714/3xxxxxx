,jellings,2007-07-22T01:17Z,"what's 'plc'?


& the other one by gnbtnt has the intro and music too.

is that the only difference or does the other one have more missing. i heard the first disc ends on chapter 2 and the 2nd disc skips to chapter 4 or something like that>"
,gnbtnt,2007-07-22T01:19Z,"hairypotter7:
i'm not sure whether this one is better, but mine has the intro music as well.

and mine's a bit smaller
(that's what she said?!)

,Junna2022,2007-07-22T10:07Z,"loisleeeeeee,

To download anything using the torrent (file-sharing) system, you need to install a program like BITLORD.

Once you have that installed, you just click on the 'Download this torrent' link and get started (it will open bitlord automatically)."
,gsquared,2007-07-22T16:22Z,how do i play this?
,nonantroll,2007-07-24T05:23Z,"These MP3 files seem to have been recorded in MP3-PRO format, rendering them incompatible with the majority of players and utilities, so if anyone's interested in joining the tracks together into complete chapters, please be very careful, as the time index settings are incorrect and will lead to the last 20 seconds or so of each file being truncated.

I had to first convert them (using Music Fan's Factory) before joining them with HiFi MP3 Joiner.  It took me almost 40 minutes to find out the files I was creating were damaged, and another 30 to figure out why!

Beware!

If anyone wants the set uploaded, repaired of course, PM me and I'll create the torrent for you guys.

Cheers!"
,jubazell,2007-07-24T14:10Z,"nonantroll:

please upload your version. would really appreciate it!

thanks!"
,wotthe7734,2007-07-31T19:51Z,"There's another torrent of this on TPB:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3748365/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_-_Audiobook
17 discs, 96 kb/s, 900+ seeders, only about 500 leechers as of today.

I'm going to try that one. Splitting files into chapters is a little annoying, but if you get proper non-mangled results, it's worth it. (Mac users - WE RULE! =grin= - get Audio Slicer. It's easy, works great, and it's free.)"
,ch1pz11,2007-08-16T01:23Z,nonantroll could you upload that torrent?  I would be be interested in downloading it as well.
,ajeetlvsu,2010-07-27T11:29Z,quality kaisa hai?
