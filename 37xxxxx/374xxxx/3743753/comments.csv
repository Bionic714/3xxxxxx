,scorchiooo,2007-07-17T01:48Z,"Think twice about downloading files from HDTV China. Many people have not been able to get these files to play, regardless of the player and codecs used. So unless you have a lot of time to waste trying to get these to work I would suggest downloading from a different ripper.

The logic of this guy eludes me. Why share files that very few people seem to be able to play.

I would advise downloading from a different ripper. It will save you a lot of bandwidth and a whole lot of hassle. Prolific he may be, but quantity is no substitute for quality."
,rickardkk,2007-07-17T10:56Z,"I use:
Haali Media Splitter

ffdshow (for audio codec, as PowerDVD Ultras audio codecs cannot be used inside of Vista Media Center)

PowerDVD Ultra 7.3 (for video codecs)

Vista Media Center frontend (Windows Media Player 11)

Perfect playback...Have downloaded 15 releases (blu-ray and hd-dvd) from HDTV CHINA.

PowerDVD Ultra gives me hardware decoding inside Vista Media Center (for nvidia 8500, 8600, ati 2400, ati 2600). If you own another card just use ffdshow for video decoding.

Download TSSplitter and you can join all files into one big .ts. I hope they keep releasing titles in this fashion."
,hurrafor,2007-07-19T16:17Z,"ABSOLUTELY works....you just have to do a little digging:

First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.


Install those and report back!

KMPlayer to play HD from HDTV CHINA

,BasseG,2007-07-26T05:24Z,"when will we be able to make blu rays work on blu ray player ie sony plastation 3. How do you burn functioning blu ray discs.
"
,machspeed5,2007-09-26T07:55Z,HDTV China you need better fucking encoding for your Blu-Ray rips! 40 GB pffffft. x264 that shit.
,sylla2,2007-12-30T19:52Z,"If you don't want to download 40 gigs of HD video, why are you even here?! Just shut up and find another torrent!"
,ApoX-207,2008-01-08T19:43Z,fuck off idiots who whine about it being to big!
,Neuromods,2008-02-23T14:03Z,"HDTV China's files work just fine if you know what you are doing. And I don't want his files to be DivX 4gb files. You loose the quality. Just check out Septics files, 4 to 6gb HD movies but you see distortion in them and not all that clear. I do wish though he would just rip the disc and leave them as is, not converting them to anything"
,microcefalus,2008-03-30T03:24Z,Someone please seed...! I have 60kb/s and this shit is on 40 GB!
,somoney,2008-04-08T16:48Z,"Better yet, some one pleas PROPER this release.  40g is just stupid for a 1080p rip with only 3 audio tracks."
,steveturner,2009-04-04T02:13Z,"Good shit, I'll seed as much as I can."
,kokousic,2009-08-03T14:00Z,Please seed.
