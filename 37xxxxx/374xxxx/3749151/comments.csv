,zeinabqureshi,2008-03-14T18:29Z,"nice one... Chris Marker has made documentaries on just about every good film director. This one's on Aleksandr Medvedkin ('Schastye'). It's a detailed documentary.
Subs...hardly seem to be complete. The French parts seem not to be complete. 
Thanks a lot for the share..."

This documentary is not only edifiying, but extremely moving. An excellent critical reflexion, a great source of images.
If you truly like cinema, and the way it's done - or can be done - don't miss this film where Chris Marker pays hommage to Russian filmmaker Aleksandr Ivanovitch Medvedkine."

This is already stated in the description, but i think some will miss this info. "
