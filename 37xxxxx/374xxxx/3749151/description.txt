Aleksandr Ivanovitch Medvedkine is a Russian film maker born in 1900.
Proud Fathers carve notches on the furniture to measure their childrenÃ¢??s growth, the century carved such notches on MedvedkineÃ¢??s life:
He was 5 and Lenin wrote what has to be done, 17 and he knew. 20 the civil war, 36 the Moscow trials. 41 world war two, 53 StalinÃ¢??s death. and when he himself dies in 1989 it is on the crest of Perestroika. 
In one of his last interviews he berated me as usual, Ã¢??you lazy bastard why donÃ¢??t you ever write... just a few lines... like this {       }Ã¢??

Dear Aleksandr Ivanovitch...

----

Chris Marker hangs his beautiful, often humorous, elegy to idealism, truth, brutality and realism upon the notches in Medvedkines life, the people whom he worked along side and the ultimate fate of that work. But whilst mourning the death, failure and corruption of the last centuries romantic optimism he also brings about the awareness of a new generation who may once again discover the innocence in those old ideals.
