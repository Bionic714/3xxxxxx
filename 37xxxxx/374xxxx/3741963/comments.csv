,Cain303,2007-07-21T02:33Z,"Works well, apart from the favorites tab being blank... Is this a bug or a config problem? I can't access the file browser now. :/"
,Cain303,2007-07-21T12:51Z,Update: Found that they had moved the file manager to the System/Memory screen in MC360.
,zombie73,2007-07-22T17:30Z,This is not better then PIMPVersion
,Fredrokk,2007-07-25T23:20Z,"Well I can play .rm and .rmvb with this one. Apple movie trailers works again, but the movie info option for individual files is gone... =/"
,Lennert,2007-08-05T17:08Z,"Hi GasGiver

The last version was much better..
I got problems when i streams from youtube. It dosent play the video in normal speed? :S

When do you release a new XBMC?

And why have you deleted all the shortcuts ind the video, music, pictures ..... menues?

It was much easyer before. Cant you just make it default and then can people delete them if the like?

the script button in the lower right corner shows a blank list... 

AMT seems to work so far... "
,0rr,2007-08-13T17:53Z,"and yes, could you please let the short cuts in?
it's a real pain to put them all again in every release."
