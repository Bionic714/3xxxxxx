I understand to have a copy at home and practice. I did myself also, but my company has 4 legal copies of this software and never made a
penny on this cracked stuff. I have experince with this software last 11 years and I mastered, but if your existence depends on aknowledge of this software and you use it to traine yourself, personaly, I think it's OK.
Looking for post processors is something ugly!
Intelectual property is worth to somebody as your
job or your machine with 3, 4, 5, or any axises.
Don't take me wrong, I am not trying to be a villain, but make money over somebody's work for free, at least it's not nice...

                                       Wish you the best!"
