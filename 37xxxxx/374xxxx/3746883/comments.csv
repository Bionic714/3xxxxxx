,chrysalis-tpb,2007-07-19T18:49Z,"Thanks a lot for the big effort you're going through with this.

If you have enough volunteers, I'd suggest a three-step procedure, with three teams: transcribe, correct possible mispells and edit&format."
,krazykayla,2007-07-19T18:53Z,Thanks so much!! I am willing to help if you need it.
,krazykarl312,2007-07-19T19:03Z,"What happened to chapters 2-10?  I stopped reading the picture version because of the poor quality and strain on my eyes to try to read it.  I really appreciate what you (or you guys) are doing, but I would like ch 2-10.  I know I probably won't be able to finish the whole book before the release even if it was available, but I would like to get a head start."

,stevenkleig,2007-07-19T19:50Z,"My type of connection doesn't allow me to connect to torrents even for a file so small :(

Could someone post a direct download link somewhere or email it to stevenkleig@gmail.com ?

I would love you forever!"
,stevenkleig,2007-07-19T20:01Z,"Got it. Thanks :)

Not sure this will last, but I suppose I'll do my part to help the few in my torrent-less situation.
