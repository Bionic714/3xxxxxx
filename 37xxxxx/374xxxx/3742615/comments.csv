This file is working 100% ; file OK ! 34 seeders have downloaded "
,d3synguy,2008-02-20T03:04Z,"Hi, I have tried many ACAD 2008 torrents and this was the first one I got to work. Of course, that was probably my own fault because I had to find a workaround for this one that may just as well have worked on others. I'm posting this in case anyone else has the same problems.

Problem: 

First of all, when I I used winrar to unpack the files, I kept getting error messages that several files could not be unpacked because the path was more than the 206 character limit.

Solution: 

1) Unpack the file in this manner and keep the error message open so that you can refer to it later. 

2) Open the ""Extraction path and Options"" dialog box. This dialog box will pop up if you choose ""extract files"" after right clicking on the .rar file, or if you open the winrar application, highlight the .rar file and click ""Extract To."" 

3) Once you have the dialog box open, click on the ""Advanced"" tab and under the ""File paths"" box, check the ""Do not extract paths"" box.

4) Go back to the ""General"" tab check the ""Skip existing files"" box.

5) Still on the ""General"" tab, click on ""Save Settings"" in the bottom left of the box.

6) Click OK to close ""Extraction path and options"" dialog box.

7) Referring to the list of files in the error message, browse to the folder (via winrar) containing each file. (The full path of each file is displayed in the error message.) Do not try to unpack the individual files. Extract the entire folder FROM THE .RAR FILE into the EXACT SAME FOLDER THAT YOU JUST EXTRACTED TO YOUR HARD DRIVE. It is very important that you make sure that the file structure in you extracted set exactly matches that in the compressed version.

You are now ready to install AutoCAD 2008. For some reason that this noob has yet to decipher, extracting the entire AutoCAD .rar file with ""Do not extract paths"" checked does not work. I tried it several time and most of the files were not extracted at all.

Thanks kungfuserge for this upload. I don't know why I ran into these problems, but obviously the torrent works. The keygen is good too. I recognized it, I've used it before. ;-)

Enjoy all."
,d3synguy,2008-02-20T03:04Z,"Oh, and I will continue to seed this one until no one wants it anymore."
,Hannibal011,2008-02-22T03:46Z,"The Serial number given does NOT work. Any advice?

Other than that no problem at all installing it. I must have done something wrong though..."
,d3synguy,2008-02-23T00:58Z,"Make sure you follow the instructions in the install.txt. 

Did you select ""Stand Alone License?""
Did you select ""Enter and Activation Code?""
Did you open the Key Generator AFTER performing these tasks and WHILE the license agreement was open?

I've used this same key generator on several Autodesk products and it has always worked perfectly for me."
,Hannibal011,2008-02-23T04:51Z,"Thanks ALOT mate! What happened is I was entering in the serial code and it kept saying it was invalid. Then I would close out of that and try loading the generator...I must have not had my coffe when doing it and was stupid. In anycase I got the damn thing working.

Now if someone tells me how to seed this thing I will DEFENITLY do it.

WORKS LIKE A CHARM!"
,piolinhead,2008-02-29T22:11Z,"I installed the program in my laptop which have Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2. In the moment that i try to generate the activation code using the serials included, one message appears:
""REQUEST CODE ERROR!"". I don't know what that means, somebody can help me"
,jimflood,2008-03-05T13:14Z,"Hi Guys
I've downloaded this program and it's working great - but when trying to load it on another PC it's asking for CD2 - which didn't happen before. Any ideas?"
,tswf666,2008-03-26T09:23Z,"Hey, when i run the setup.exe, i IMMEDIATLEY recieve this error:

Error 1606 : Could not Access network location Autodesk\AutoCAD2008\R17.1\enu\

Whudufux up? can someone help me out here?"
,Arkanis001,2008-05-22T01:05Z,Works great! Make sure to follow directions carefully - you have to READ them before you install!!  great torrent!
,cracker1,2008-06-08T09:01Z,"Perfect torrent, quick download and easy install"
,gomelendez,2008-06-10T02:53Z,"Great torrent, it works. Read the instructions carefully before installing. Congrats..."
,zackismet,2008-06-22T14:24Z,"i was able to open the rar file fine, but i have no idea how to install it. everyu other rar i've used has been far more straightforward. open. find ""instructions"" readme. follow instructions. use keygen. program works.

well i can't find any instructions readme. the completed unrar file also says it's only 699 MB, while the size here claims 762. why am i almost 100 short? it completed downloading and everything.

when i try to install it, nothing asks me for any information the keygen would provide, and just when it's almost complete it stops and says, ""internal error: 2356.data1.cab""

what the heck do i do?"
,outta.dis.world,2008-08-04T18:13Z,Does this work on Win XP x64?
