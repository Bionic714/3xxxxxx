,Element_alchemist,2008-09-27T23:02Z,"AMAZING SERIES!  THIS SEASON WAS THE BEST I loved it! i downloaded this torrent and watched every single episode.

The show it self:
 if you are interested in this kind of thing it is a really good show. And tho it may not seem like it, it is hardly as ""kiddy"" as you might think. Either way i think anyone should give it a chance.
The Torrent
Not very high quality the size of the individual files vary. the opening and ending are cut out of each make them generally around 20 minute episodes. This also a few seconds of commercial between breaks (5-8seconds). once i got to about the later episodes (330-340ish) the quality dipped a bit more.
     All and it all its a watchable torrent. a fair size for 51 episodes the quality didn't bother me much  and i am happy with my download. Tho if i wanted to archive them i would problem want a better copy. 
    Either way it is exactly what it says it is a tv rip and if your interested in it than downloaded it. I know i didn't wanna download a 20 gig file. so this one was right up my alley it was nice to be able to watch the episodes one after another especially during the climactic parts."

,TrueGlitch86,2012-02-15T14:34Z,whys the episodes marked as 301 - 351 i mean shouldn't it be like  105 - 155 because it only been 104 episodes because it is only season 3
,brucelipp,2012-02-17T15:24Z,"@TrueGlitch86  it's 301. The first digit, 3, Represents the season, then the two digits afterwards represents the episode. This is how almost all shows do it. So 301 is Season 3 Episode 1."
