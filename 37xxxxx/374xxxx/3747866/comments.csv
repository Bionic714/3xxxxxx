,ghsodt,2008-03-20T07:58Z,"Yes, this is a pretty standard codec ffmpeg (default for my rip software in fact) so I'm guessing you're on M$ Windows and maybe just trying to make the Windoze Media Player have the right codecs? That can be complicated since Microsoft likes to take away abilities rather than give them. So, use a different product. Try VLC. It's open source. Another good player is called mplayer but I think that is harder to download for M$. So try VLC first. Alternately you could try an ffmpeg codec pack. I can't say exactly how since i don't use windoze. But VLC is the easiest thing. It's called VideoLAN."
