This software is getting hard to find on the web now. Its great for changing your Nokia phones product code, then using the official Nokia Software Updater to get the official Nokia firmware instead of the one your network installed. It even works for the latest BB5 phones, becuase its NOT unlocking them, its just changing the software. You can also change IMEI (illegal in some countries, dont risk it!) and other important data, and flash parts of the phone (i think).
