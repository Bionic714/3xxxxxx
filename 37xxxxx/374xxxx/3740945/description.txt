release info

After releasing their debut album in 2005 and passing through a long    
musical and spiritual journey.                                          
                                                                         
Bubble (Guy Sarnat and Karen Bagdasarov) are back with their second     
album entitled Sound of Silence. A gained experience together with      
intense studio work generated that unique and advanced sound that has   
become Bubble's trademark.The new album features a wide variety of     
musical elements.                                                       
                                                                         
Skillful innovating production, Vocal and instrumental recordings and   
influences that are related to a wide range of musical fields, all of   
them combined, build a strong and powerful piece that radiant with     
emotion and energy. When ethnic vibes collides with state of the art    
music machinery and Indian sitar clashes rocking vocal roars, something 
erupts.                                                                 
                                                                         
All Mastered and cooked by the hands of this creative duo, surely, the 
result is worthy of its high attention.Bubble welcomes you to join them 
in their trip, so sweat it on the dance floor or let it vibrate your    
home. Experience music's diversity, and enjoy the loud Sound of Silence
