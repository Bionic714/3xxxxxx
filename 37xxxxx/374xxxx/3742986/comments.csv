,kamaxel,2007-07-22T23:34Z,Är det bara att installera eller är det nåt att tänka på
,mrleecorporation,2007-07-25T14:29Z,I'll seed
,MrJezzual,2007-08-04T14:31Z,"tyvm!! Downloaded very fast and i can finally get away from cruddy vista!

Seeding at this very second"
,MrJezzual,2007-08-04T16:37Z,I am write in thinking this is the full install isn't it? Not the upgrade
,penguincomrade,2007-08-14T00:16Z,hmm.. it didn't work out for me.. neither one of those serials.. even tried the serial that I have that usually works.. o_o wtf.. why doesn't it work for me..
,penguincomrade,2007-08-14T00:29Z,"Ah, never mind, I got it to work. I guess I can't use my own serial or else it'll continue to say invalid key."
,heemax3000,2007-08-16T06:08Z,"please use the serial typed on setup.  
this one doesnt need activation! 
i think this's OEM version and that's why these serials doesnt work.
"
,6-FigurePirate,2007-08-22T08:40Z,"umm...ok thats great, but i got 2 questions. 1: is it like the full intallable version or is it an upgrade version, and 2, can boot from it and install it afterward? cuz i use ubuntu, and it wont use the setup.exe, or whatever way it installs. RSVP, thank you!!!"
,bikeclips63,2007-08-30T19:58Z,"@ 6-FigurePirate,
You can download using Ubuntu.  When it's finished, open it and right-click the file "" X2PVOL EN.iso "".  Select ""write to disc"".  This burns the image to cd. 
It's not a ""live cd"" like many Linux distros. You have to install it to use it. "
[T],ripthejacker420,2008-07-31T02:37Z,hey all. here i am running this exact copy of win xp and it works great!! all u have 2 do is run the cd (must be in windows).  i found out the hard way that this is NOT a bootable disc and it requires u 2 have windows already.  thank u so so much heemax
,heemax3000,2008-09-27T20:04Z,"probably u did something wrong or your optical drive or media has some problem. 
if you open this ISO with some ISO editor like MagicISO u gonna see the boot sector of the CD: ""bootable"". 
Remember that ""copy and paste"" CD contents from ISO to a new image doesn't work, cause of boot sector of CD. u need to burn this ISO."
