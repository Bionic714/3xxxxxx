,(s.i.e),2008-09-13T19:13Z,"i'm searching for the OST from final fantasy tactics A2 grimoire of the rift (DS) are you able to rip it for me maybe as0k?

i noticed that on the speakers of the DS the sound is terrible due to the bad quality of a DS speaker but when i plug my headset in it i would swear it's a normal orchest so it might be something for you to work on."

some of my most cherished memories are of this game, it's great to find the soundtrack for it so readily available. too bad my game was sold along with the console a few years back--i dearly miss it. so thank you for helping me get back a bit of this happiness. "
