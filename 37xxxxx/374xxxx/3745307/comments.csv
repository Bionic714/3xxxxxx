,Waldobaby (where?),2007-07-18T03:23Z,"Actually, SILENT HILL is a gray, dreary ""Hell on Earth"" movie that relies heavily on boredom and wooden acting. Blame an inept director. This one is not in any way a keeper."
,ParasiteGod,2007-07-30T08:18Z,"I think it's cool, it's not often you see a blueray film here"
,NINgod,2008-04-08T01:46Z,this movie was good so die.
,dashNeo,2008-10-23T22:14Z,this is a good movie but takes weeks and weeks to download......it might be because there's 1 seeder and it's 37.86 GB..... 
,figment,2008-12-21T19:48Z,"Waldobaby, in my opinion I despise critics because all u do is sit around and critique everything as though ur gods gift on earth for films. Direct a movie u piece of shit if u think u can do better otherwise no one cares about ur worthless 2 cents fag"
,Silver-Rex,2009-01-23T23:57Z,I like the silent hill movie but why is this 37.86 GB? I know its blue-ray but im not going to download for a few graphics improvements I think this has silent hill games aswell or some thing.
