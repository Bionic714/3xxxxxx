,420dopeman,2007-07-15T12:50Z,"Since so many are having problems with the .iso version of this game, I will indeed look in to your language pack request. 
Although I can not share it until valid seeders are well in control of this swarm. The enemy will continue to try to take control of this torrent, please remember to seed this all, as best you can... And use my provided blocklist anyway possible.

,420dopeman,2007-07-16T10:53Z,"Yes mate, I choose to block ads, spyware, p2p, and government IP's.  The only one to not worry so much about is the educational IP blocking.

If you get stuck on mission 2, then download ""Unleashed mission Unlocker"", this will give you all missions. Check GameCopyWorld.

You also need administrator-rights in windows to install AGEIA PhysX."

Game works fine after update."

,Hunteren,2011-08-16T00:44Z,"I have a problem with this game, with both this version and and this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4642110/Ghost_Recon_advanced_warfighter_2_%5BPC-DVD%5D

I install / extract the game fine, but when I try to run it I it crashes, and my default debugger comes up and asks if I wanna debug it.

I've tried to update it to v1.5, but it still crashes. Just without my debugger even comming up.

It never shows any sign of starting the game or anything, it just opens the .exe for a short moment, and then it closes again.

Can anybody help?
Thanks.

I'm running XP SP3 and I have both Directx and PhysX completely updated.
My hardware are fine too, I should be able to run the game smoothly. If I just get it to boot. "
