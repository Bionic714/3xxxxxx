,bozemansapphire,2007-10-25T06:22Z,Will this go full screen?
,LancerMind,2007-11-03T19:46Z,good quality!
,mac-torrent,2007-11-24T10:25Z,Plays on my Mac with Quicktime.  Burned it and plays on my Plasma.  Picture quality is 10/10 and the audio is 9/10 because you have to raise the volume up a little bit more than you would usually do while watching other movie.  But overall.... it's all good.  Thanks spencer07

,harigata,2008-09-01T23:33Z,"Does anybody know how to play subtitles with divx?
There is no option to do so in the menu of divx. Neither is there such an option in FUCKING M$ Media FUCKING player..... I mean...... is this too much to ask? Dragging and dropping don't work either..... the subs file I have is an *.srt"
[V],godcanjudgeme,2008-09-15T08:11Z,"To all those with audio & no video, or video & no audio..
download FREE the xvid and or divx codecs.. 
10 seconds on google it's a great tool!!
Alternatively, download VLC media player which has too many codecs all installed and for free.
To play an .srt sub file, on most media players, download VOBSUB 2.23 (again google it). 
Then place the .srt file in exactly the same folder as the movie file is in and rename the .srt file to exactly the same as the movie file + .srt...
e.g.
movie file = the lion king
then the srt file must be titled = the lion king.srt
press play, have fun and pass on the knowledge."

,kithylin,2009-12-28T14:33Z,"I don't know how some of you can possibly think this is ""good quality"". Played it on a standard 1920x1080 hdtv and it's stretched out and pixelated, with ugly compression artifacts everywhere.

This might look good if you're still using a 800x600 CRT or something ancient."
,eriefayr,2010-01-07T03:23Z,it may go full screen if you ask nicely. XD
