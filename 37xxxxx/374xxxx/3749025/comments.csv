,ItsNotEasyBeingGreen,2007-07-22T12:33Z,"(spotting my own misunderstanding) THIS file of CD5 is correct, nothing missing, just a bit of extra silence. However, the old CD5 file sounds clipped at the end, yes."

Thank you for this torrent I listen it all, and the disk 10th and the 15th are like the 5th in the same place(at 2 or 3 minutes from the final). There are only small glitches, but how you said before, you are a perfectionist so could you re-rip the final track from these disks too? 

Anyway thank you veryyyyy much."
