,Dark^,2007-11-04T01:50Z,"The only dumb fucker here is the one calling other people names - rymdrattan.

So what if people want to ask others if they can seed? Sometimes people will just drop off once they hit a certain ratio, if they happen to come across this post in the future and see people asking for seeds it only takes 2 seconds to redownload the torrent file and re-seed.

STFU troll and crawl back under your rock where you belong."
,Dark^,2007-11-04T01:52Z,"oops, after all that forgot to thank you for uploading this, cheers dushy."

,darkvineyard,2007-12-11T14:29Z,"Thank you! ^^

Wow, 219 seeders, 99 leechers -- is that good?
I hope this downloads. I freaking love Scrubs! >< *laughs*

I'm new at this, so could someone tell me how to seed? *sheepish*"
,fetish.alias,2008-02-05T06:01Z,"Sound and video quality is spotty in places, with one episode where the sound fades in and out throughtout the whole ep. Some weird visual artifacts sometimes and lots of encoding choppiness. I'd have to give it a 6/10.

Still, very much appreciated, thanks for the upload."
,Markuslolcopter,2008-03-03T22:07Z,"Thanks for the upload :). 
I know it's a while ago this torrent was uploaded and that people might not be seeding it anymore, however, I would really appreciate if someone could seed this torrent for a while, until I get it, and after that, I'll be seeding for a couple of weeks. Cheers ;)"
,rymdrattan,2008-03-08T12:05Z,Dark^ - You have to be damn naive to believe in such a thing. Or perhaps be 15yrs old. The toothfairy isn't real numbnuts!
,ahrajojo,2008-03-13T21:41Z,"jajaja,,: torrent downloaded from demonoid.

demonoid was so great,,,,,,,  :`(,,,,

but, hey what a great torrent,,,

 thnx "
,ahrajojo,2008-03-13T21:45Z,"by the way, you wrote  : The Opening Theme Song:

""Superman"" performed by Lazlo Bane,,,,, but its not 

included on the torrent,,, or it is?"
,Josod052,2008-03-29T23:58Z,WOW! 20 peers and one seed^^
,antonskonto,2008-04-20T13:02Z,It is swe sub?
,Judaz81,2008-05-19T22:18Z,"The audio on this one is fucked up if anyone cares, as the show itself is great :) Thanks for the upload!
And as for the pleads for others to seed, I usually check the comments before I start downloading so that if there are a lot of requests for seeding, I turn to another torrent. 
So, the pleads serve a purpose here."
,Ryssen88,2008-07-09T13:15Z,"Please seed guys/gals , JD is the man :D"
