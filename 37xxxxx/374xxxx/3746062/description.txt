Hi, i want to share with you an archive with all strips of Megatokio:
  http://www.megatokyo.com/

Here you'll find all strips from the first one to 1025, and a well-commented, amateur bash script, that'll fetch strips for you, and maybe teach you basics of bash script programming ;)

hope you'll like it, and hope you'll help me seeding this.
