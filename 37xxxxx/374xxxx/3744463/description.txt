Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 is a tactical first-person shooter computer game developed by Tripwire Interactive. Set on the Eastern Front during World War II between 1941 and 1945, Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 depicts the struggle between Soviet and German forces. The game's creators, Tripwire Interactive, developed the game out of the previous Unreal Tournament 2004 mod, Red Orchestra: Combined Arms. While the game is a first-person shooter in the tradition of more familiar WWII-themed games, Red Orchestra is noted for its unusual emphasis on realism and authenticity.
