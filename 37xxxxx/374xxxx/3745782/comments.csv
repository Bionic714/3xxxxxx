,transcriptor66,2007-07-18T20:08Z,"Looks great but why didn't you use justification when formating the book?? It's really anoying to read a book with the current format. Take a look at the original pictures.
Hope you're going to change it for the real release!"
,Koerok,2007-07-18T22:34Z,Please continue from where we are: Chapter 11!
,Koerok,2007-07-18T22:44Z,"Look, I really appreciate that you are doing, but it will be all in vain if you do not finish before the release. Someone is gonna cut up a book than and scan the pages, it's as simple as that. So please, leave the first 10 chapters for now (the fans have read them by now) and focus on the next ten. "
