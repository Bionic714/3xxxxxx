I am still looking for the Stephen Fry edition. Harry Potter is just not the same without him.

Stephen you are in my dreams!!"

,paod82,2007-07-22T15:07Z,i agree stephen fry does do a better job
,antaries,2007-07-22T15:19Z,I'm guessing this is the US version. It is the same size and bitrate as the one I downloaded yesterday. 
,HellNesser,2007-07-23T22:20Z,I thought it was a guy called Jim Dale who did these books?? He holds the record for the biggest number of different voices. 134 different vioces in Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix!
