Btw wrong category."
[T],Mincan,2009-05-12T05:19Z,NTSC or PAL?
,LightTheRebellion,2010-09-05T08:28Z,"Says ""NTSC"" in tag, Mincan, but you can hack your DVD player to play any region."
,El_Hanko,2012-07-30T05:17Z,"No menus (or extras, of course), just the movie. No extra audio tracks or subtitles either, just english, as the uploader states.

Yes, it's NTSC. The region code and NTSC/PAL specification are two different things, to watch a PAL DVD you need a DVD player (and a TV) capable of handling PAL."
