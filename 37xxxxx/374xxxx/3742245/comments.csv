If you download a Movie like that (with a password) delete it from your HARD DRIVE and post a comment to warn others, and soon these people will geet the point. ANd if you post torrents in WinRaR format or any other zip format let us all know it is PASSWORD FREE. KEEP IT FREE AND EASY, OR KISS MY SHIEY WHITE ASS>"
