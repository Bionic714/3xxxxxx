,mosstrooperuk,2008-03-21T10:23Z,"This French version is an excellent product and I want to give this a go.
 They have now produced an updated version which has a revision disk in it that excludes the students efforts (who can be irritating when you listen to the course more than twice). 

Does any one have the revision disk? Will you please seed it if you have? Many thanks"
,BitMistress,2008-04-23T12:05Z,This course is by far the best I've tried.  Thanks for sharing.
