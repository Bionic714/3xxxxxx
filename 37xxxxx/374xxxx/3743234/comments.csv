,ThreeDee,2007-07-18T05:10Z,"hah, i know. prince gave his cds away for free or something coz he was annoyed with the record companies"
,freakfunk13,2007-08-12T14:35Z,"Prince talks shit so all his fans think he's a rebel, it made the paper have a higher circulation and earned him more money that releasing another CD through the paper, if he wanted to really give it away free he would have uploaded it here!"
[T],splattergod,2007-09-18T18:07Z,"Regardless whether it's free or you paid for it, one thing is certain....
This CD blows!
What the hell happened w/ Prince?
Guess he's run out of ideas...
Just tired, silly topics, with no real hooks....
This has to be Prince's ""St Anger"" or ""Chinese Democracy""...
He only gave it away to save the embarrassment of the cut out bins..."
