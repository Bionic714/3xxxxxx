So unless you have a lot of time to waste trying to get these to work I would suggest downloading from a different ripper.

The logic of this guy eludes me. Why share files that very few people seem to be able to play.

I would advise downloading from a different ripper. It will save you a lot of bandwidth and a whole lot of hassle. Prolific he may be, but quantity is no substitute for quality."

First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.


Install those and report back!

If you download those 3 and install them all downloads from HDTV CHINA will work Have downloaded 40 and all works"

,JumperPunk,2007-07-31T07:00Z,"as hurrafor said, use HDTVPump and Matroska Splitter and it works.  i ended up using Media Player Classic to play the files.  the only thing that didnt work for me was the surround sound (ended up listening in stereo), but ive not gotten anything to work in true 5.1 surround in x64 XP

this was my first attempt at HD, and it was mondo worth it.  finally able to play something in full screen on my 20"" widescreen that doesnt look like crap. ill always go for a HD download when i have the option from here on out."

,Dark_Dragon,2008-03-25T01:48Z,"Please, SEED! I really like to download this movie. Otherwise downloading speed is almost zero! Currently it is so low that estimated download time is ""unknown""...

And for people who currently downloading (or want to start download): don't limit upload speed so much! Remember, your download speed is proportional to your upload speed.

And again, please SEED this great torrent more! Thanks."
