First of all, download the torrent.

When it is finished downloading it, you need to mount the iso image with daemon tools. If you done have daemon tools, google it. Open Daemon tools. It will appear as a little Icon in the bottom right hand corner of your screen. click it and go to Device 1: (no media). After that find the iso image you just downloaded and click it. Daemon tools will now run it.

Click auto run and let it install. When it asks for the cd key, open the ""crack"" folder and run the keygen application. Then, type in the key that it gives you and hit continue. Let it install.

After it finishes it will ask you if you want to launch the game. Click no. 

Now, open the Harry Potter - Order of Pheonix folder and open the crack folder again. Then right click the game icon on your desktop, and go to ""Open file location"". Or, go to:

C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.
COPY, do not drag, the ""hp"" application from the crack folder into: C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. 

Click yes and replace when it asks you too.

You are done. The game should work."
,Mada666,2008-02-03T07:14Z,"I hope that helps. If anything is unclear, let me know. 

Also, people are screaming for seeders, so I will seed at 50ish Kbs/s for a while. During the day.

Oh, and another thing. Someone said that the cracks had a trojan in it. I scaned it all with AVG and it came up clean. 

The game works fine."

First of all, download the torrent.

When it is finished downloading it, you need to mount the iso image with daemon tools. If you done have daemon tools, google it. Open Daemon tools. It will appear as a little Icon in the bottom right hand corner of your screen. click it and go to Device 1: (no media). After that find the iso image you just downloaded and click it. Daemon tools will now run it.

Click auto run and let it install. When it asks for the cd key, open the ""crack"" folder and run the keygen application. Then, type in the key that it gives you and hit continue. Let it install.

After it finishes it will ask you if you want to launch the game. Click no.

Now, open the Harry Potter - Order of Pheonix folder and open the crack folder again. Then right click the game icon on your desktop, and go to ""Open file location"". Or, go to:

C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.
COPY, do not drag, the ""hp"" application from the crack folder into: C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.

Click yes and replace when it asks you too.

You are done. The game should work. "

Windows Vista 3GB RAM 3800 AMD Athlon 64 Bit Processor.
and thanks to Killer331 that key works great if you cannot get the game keygen working.
For those who have an issue with the installation saying you need Directx 9 or higher and you already have it, go to the drive you have it mounted on, right click, click explore. Find Autorun.exe and right click it, go to properties, compatibility and set it to run for windows xp service pack 2. That worked for me."

,sergiokun,2011-02-17T23:33Z,"Geez what a bunch of crying babies ! If you don't know how to mount a CD search on google damn it.
Here's all you have to do:
1- Mount the iso and launch autorun.exe
2- When it asks for a serial, just run keygen.exe and it writes a serial number automatically, then close keygen and proceed to the installation.
3- After the game is installed, open the Crack folder, copy hp.exe, then go to C:/Program Files/ Electronic Arts/ Harry potter order of phoenix/ AND THERE PASTE IT. You should see before pasting hp.exe, another hp.exe, so it will logically ask you to replace it, SAY YES.
There you go, now you just have to do a shortcut on your desktop of ""hp.exe"" and every time you have to play, just click ""hp.exe"" on your desktop.
I describes one by one every steps of the installation and next time you want to install a game, just do the same. If you still can't do it then you're an Epic Fail  ;)
Maybe it will help someone"
