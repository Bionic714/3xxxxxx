,bbblolol,2009-04-10T18:32Z,"Hey guys the whole point of torrent is that you download AND upload. The more you upload the faster you can download. Right now, only 100 people are uploading, and 2000 people are downloading. How is this possible? If everyone would download and upload we would all have extremely high download speeds... thats the magic behind bittorent... realize that you are only screwing yourself over by sabotaging the system!"

,greatwiz666,2010-04-05T21:25Z,"I'm fed up with this bullshit!

To ALL who who complains about DLspeed and too ""few"" seeders, listen up;

There are THREE possible reasons why those 63.31 GiBs aren't downloaded in a blink of an eye:

1. Your internet connection sucks.
2. Your settings aren't configured correctly
3. Your PC sucks too much to handle the speed you are looking for.

So now you know! Please shut your fucking mouths, and accept the fact that the world of filesharing requires both time and brains!"
,HerrHur,2010-04-13T16:46Z,"To those of you that think the torrent is too large or slow:

Set episode 1-50 to be downloaded with ""Highest priority"" in your bittorrent client. That way you can watch the first episodes while you are waiting for the others to download."
