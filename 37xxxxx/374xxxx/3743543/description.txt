THE MOVIE:

Cute Nina Jacobs is writing a book on the subject of online sex, sexual liaisons arranged online, but some of her lovely interviewees are turning up dead, strangled. Are they victims of foul play or erotic asphyxiation gone bad? While she assists the handsome police detective Max, Nina worries about a crime connection to her book. To add to her troubles, her relationship with her beau is becoming troubled.

The movie seeks to resolve these questions while presenting us with a smorgasbord of kinky sex. Several sexy actresses provide nice shows, and most of the acting is believable, even if the story is a little far-fetched. But again, it's all we need as an excuse for multiple sexual presentations in a typical Marc Greenberg production. We would not knock Mr. Greenberg's results, as he is generally successful delivering what the soft porn viewers want. The story fits, with reasonable transitions and without troubling discontinuities and plot lapses.

The actresses are generally fairly pretty and sexy, and the guys are handsome enough. I thought detective Max was a little heavy, almost comically serious, in his part, but his was still a reasonable character portrayal. Then while not a bombshell showstopper, Julian Wells, as protagonist Nina, seemed a capable actress herself, quite attractive and engaging in her own manner.
