I will have to wait till I seed to straighten it out. I think it would mix up the hash values for those 6 songs. Is this someones Jerky Version of Their Dream?

01 Rainy Season should be Cold Imagination
02 Cold Imagination should be Topless
03 Topless should be Rainy Season
06 Out of Shape With Me should be Some Will Pay
07 Some Will Pay should be Waiting for a Train
08 Waiting for a Train should be Out of Shape With Me"
