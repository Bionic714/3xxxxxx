,jueljuel,2007-07-21T22:13Z,"Thanks a lot. Looks to be a great addon. I havenÂ´t heard about it before, but it sure looks kinda handy, thank you  "
,flightcrazy,2007-07-21T22:31Z,"It is a great add-on, very usefull if your using a preset weather in FS, say you have fs set to a thunder storm, this will add what ever you have selected in the program and add it to the preset weather condition, intensifing it dramatically.

,FSSR.Keyno,2007-07-22T00:50Z,"hmmm try this then...

,flightcrazy,2007-07-22T01:17Z,"ive seen the site, but like i say, 50-50, see what comes across my path, but if anything new pops up and i can get my hands on it i will upload it for you all.

This community has given so much to me, it is now my time to give the community so much back (if that makes sense)

[T],stevekasian,2007-07-22T02:08Z,"That makes no sense at all, flightcrazy. TAKE TAKE TAKE!! J/K

Of course, it makes GREAT sense. Thanks so much for your contributions here. I, too have procured so many wonderful progies, thanks to the scene here... and I try to give back whenever I can.

Kenyo: aaah, the new link works. The first one was bad, but I didn't try just the domain itself before googling. And alas, it's a new company not yet indexed by google! Thanks for the new link ;-)
SK"
,flightcrazy,2007-07-22T03:11Z,"Well im going to be recieving Captain Sim C-130 Hercules in a few days time, Monday or Tuesday, so i'll upload that aswell, ive got plenty more add ons, just a case of finding them, i had a clear out other day and placed them in a box somewhere.

In any case look out for some new uploads in the next few weeks, becuase if i find that darn box there's gonna be tons :-)

[T],stevekasian,2007-07-22T07:58Z,"Hey, you know what would be really cool?

I am not really into payware aircraft cuz they're so unfriendly to framerates. Plus, I've found that freeware aircraft most times have more realistic textures and looks about them over all. But one thing that's hard to find, and is always really welcome IMO, is a jetliner that has lots of realistic mechanical mechanisms - moving parts - like all the different doors open/close, lighting that is actually realistic, like wing lights, tail lighting, runway illuminators, etc.  If you've got any not-too-CPU-hoggy aircraft that have those types of cool features, I'm real interested!

Let me know if you need something as well, cuz I'll UL it if I got it.

,BlackBug,2007-07-22T08:50Z,"Hey thanx man. Searched for this all over. If I am not mistaken Flight1 recommends this for use with GroundEnv Pro. Had given up the thought of adding this to my booty. 

There is God, after all. And he has a funny way of making himself felt. Thanx for the upload,again. Keep 'em coming. "
,flightcrazy,2007-07-22T09:45Z,"I have uploaded some aircraft along that line SK, there aint any VC but most have alot of mechanical parts, for example, the 777 (meljet) if you open all entrances, you will find that the cargo hatches on the sides open, the engines open to reveal the wiring inside, the passenger doors open, accurate lighting and a few other things, its in Jumbo's and embrears.

it comes with most of the beoing family, and there are 2 version of the embrear aswell.

They don't have a single impact on frames either, unless your running the oldest os to date and youre computer is about to die :-)"
[T],stevekasian,2007-07-22T10:15Z,"Cool - Tnx.
I've got both the MelJets already - I like them alot ;-) I sure wish he'd do some other models as well.

,flightcrazy,2007-07-22T21:27Z,"SK, what scenery packages do you have ? im interested lol"
[T],stevekasian,2007-07-22T23:06Z,"haha... We'll have to take another approach to this, flightcrazy: What sceneries are you looking for?"
,flightcrazy,2007-07-23T00:31Z,"lol okay, Im only looking for British Airports Wales and West Midlands.

If you do have it, it would be a much, much, much appreaciated upload :-)

Thanks

,flightcrazy,2007-07-23T13:15Z,"My mistake, there for fs2002 grr
