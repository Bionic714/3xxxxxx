My first upload so if i have f*cked up along the way somewhere, please tell me and just say where and how it can be avoided!

I bought this just after xmas, its served me well! You need netframework installed (it will say which version hilst installing) and you will also need FSUIPC installed.

The serial is included in notepad.txt format.

I HAVE NOT TESTED THIS ON VISTA!!!

I have some serials for some other FS2004 products including abacus A380 and Vickers VC10. PM me if you want them!

Enjoy!
