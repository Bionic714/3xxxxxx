-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The last time we saw Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), he was being tormented by 
rival Bruce Nolan onscreen, live from their Buffalo TV station. But as time 
passed and Evan has made up with Bruce, he's gone onto bigger and better things. 
Newly elected to Washington D.C. as a congressman, Evan has left Buffalo, New 
York in pursuit of a greater calling. But that calling isn't serving in the 
illustrious ranks of America's politics, but being summoned by the Almighty 
himself (Morgan Freeman), who has handed Evan the task of building a new ark, 
much as Noah did before. With time passing by and his family belittled by Evan's 
newfound realization, Evan will have to do the work that God has given him in 
what promises to be an unusual adventure for a man who just wanted to serve his 
country, might actually be serving humanity.
