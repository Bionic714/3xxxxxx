,Aggressor01,2007-07-22T17:34Z,"Warning!!! 

The patch actually makes the game preform worse. Many looses the 5.1 sound, the FPS drops and the glitches is still there. Atari made a big blunder! "
,mauke88,2007-07-22T20:47Z,well mine works atleast slightly better but i think the crack is fucked up i think(no suprise there..). all else works fine but it tries to connect to server if i try to enter a race even on offline mode(tried several different profiles too). i can only cruise around the island. hope the new yasu 1.3 can help when it comes...
