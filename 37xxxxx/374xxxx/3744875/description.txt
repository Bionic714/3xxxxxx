Synopsis: Luther Whitney (Eastwood) witnesses a murder while being in a place where he should have never been, watching what he should have never seen. Now, who would believe in his word? Who would trust in Luther Whitney if he declared that he had witnessed a terrific crime that involved directly the President of United States? This magnificent thriller starred and directed by Clint Eastwood is based on David Baldaccis best-selling novel. The stellar cast includes Gene Hackman and Ed Harris, who increase the suspense and action between Whitney, Presidents security men, the sergeant of local police and the highest levels of the White House. Clint Eastwood proves his mastery by raising the stakes on the thriller genre. In Absolute Power, he shows once more this mastery.
