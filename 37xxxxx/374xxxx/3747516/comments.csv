The avi is a 700mb version and it comes with a new beginning (which seems to be the official teaser), wherein the new title is (not too well) added. The end credits are also new and feature the teaser music as full version, combined with a self created slide-show, which is nice to watch, but could have been through the entire end credits. The second half is just black. But that is a very minor problem as the audience is supposed to listen to the music there anyway, I guess. It's been a while since I watched the original, but I am sure you changed more than your info says. I checked the beginning text and it is different inmy original.

The edit:
The image quality of the avi is a bit unsharp, mabye because you only chose 700mb and I think I saw a slight stutter in long camera drives, but that is not too annoying. Also some of the zooms you made, made the picture a bit blurry, but that is also not a major problem. Technically this was fantastic. No visual flaws. And I watched one of the scenes you deleted (shitman) on my original to compare and it is really incredible what you did there, to make the story flow and let him completely disappear.
the audio quality was almost perfect for stereo sound. The beginning seemed a bit too loud. Still: great
editing: 5 of 5
image quality: 4 of 5 (for an avi)
audio quality: 5 of 5 (for an avi)

Entertainment:
This is still no masterpiece, but it is VERY entertaining now. You really improved this movie about as much as possible and I love your version.
So, compared to the original
5 of 5

Extras:
It was an avi, but still you added a nice and informative info and a very cool cover art, which can also be used for a DVD.
No subtitles, no other audio.
4 of 5 (for an avi)

resulting in... and hold your breath guys, because I really rarely do this:
5 of 5 from me. "
