,Whodaimen,2007-07-20T01:54Z,"There is only x amount of pages because our format is different.


Its not going to be the same amount of pages as the book, because the font size has changed.


Get it?"
,thetyr,2007-07-20T01:54Z,"possibly because its size 12, single spaced on much larger pages than your normal book..."

,bigmaciraq,2007-07-20T03:31Z,"I don't believe that this is an actual transcription of the book.  The writing style, although MUCH better than the one from April, still differs from J.K. Rowling.  Also, I have already seen a few errors in the storyline.  I don't mind though.  I'll probably read the whole thing anyway"
,laddiebuck,2007-07-20T03:38Z,"If you think this is the real deal, you've been nicely duped. (But console yourself -- so has a lot of American press.) This should be evident to any careful observer who has read even one Harry Potter book.

Of course, it's possible that Rowling suffered a complete change of writing style and deserted her brains at the eleventh hour. But it's far more likely this is just a fake."
,Ff001ish,2007-07-20T03:41Z,"thanks for all your hard work dudes, and a good release time"
,[BLT]FQX,2007-07-20T03:55Z,Good job!
,phooey108,2007-07-20T04:20Z,"laddiebuck:
Piss off. The book reads like every other Potter book and the complexity of the developments are such that only JKR's clone could have written them."
,Propel_Is_Awesome,2007-07-20T04:46Z,"http://www.sendspace.com/file/ohxgdb

That's the .txt file. I take no credit, I just converted from .pdf to .txt."
,bigmaciraq,2007-07-20T04:51Z,"Laddybuck is absolutely correct.  Some small examples of errors that Rowling would certainly not have missed:  

In chapter two, we see Harry comment that he doesn't know spells to cure his cut finger.  However, in book 6, Harry learned the ""Episky"" spell from Tonks which is good enough to fix a broken nose.  Also, in Chapter 4 Hermione makes a comment that ""Goyle's potion tasted like bogies."" even though she had never tasted Goyles Polyjuice potion.  

Any real nerdy reader of the Harry Potter series can find dozens of these small errors.  The style is a decent imitation, but definitely not Rowling."
,javier.ardilas,2007-07-20T04:52Z,"This is the real book, not a fake, NYTimes Michiko Kakutani, reviewed this same book, he bought it ilegally

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/19/books/19potter.html?_r=1&oref=slogin"
,bigmaciraq,2007-07-20T05:00Z,"LOL!  First of all, why would a reviewer need to buy the book illegally?  Reviewers get free advance copies in hopes that they say a nice quote that they can stick in the dust cover of the release.  Second of all, why would the fact that someone reviewed the book be any proof that this one is a copy of his?

It's a decent fanfic, but I am positive that it is not Rowling."
,bigmaciraq,2007-07-20T05:06Z,"Sure, if you want to ignore the two glaring examples that I have already provided."
,wilfreda,2007-07-20T05:09Z,"I'm *hoping* it's a fake--I didn't think it was very good. It reads like somebody browsed through a fan forum, picked out all the favorite theories, and then cobbled them together into a lumpy kind of pastiche. There are some decent bits at the end, but I really don't want this to be the real book. I guess we'll all find out who's right in a couple days."
,Whodaimen,2007-07-20T05:18Z,"I can't speak for the potion, but Episky is a nose only spell.


It set the bone, not healed a cut.

If you could heal all cuts with a single spell, why would you need to be advanced in magic to become a Healer, and work at St Mungos?"
,Balnizar,2007-07-20T05:19Z,"Lol at every1 who thinks this is fake. This text matches exactly the pictures that were taken from the book....And theres no way these pictures are fakes, you can see the real book with the covers and all the proper layout for a harry potter book...Nobody would go that far for a simple fake. If you dont like the style or the story, well too bad for you...there wont be anything else lol. "
,bigmaciraq,2007-07-20T05:21Z,As YoungerWand said.  We'll see.
,Whodaimen,2007-07-20T05:24Z,"Look up the first paragraph of the first chapter that was accidentally shown on the news closeup footage.

Its the same text as our .pdf.


If that isn't conclusive proof, I'm not sure what is."
,titanicsink,2007-07-20T05:53Z,"I really hope this is a real copy. I've still got my copy reserved to be picked up, but i just don't feel like waiting. no offense to rowling, but those people who got their books early, badddddd publicity stunt for her"
,wilfreda,2007-07-20T05:53Z,"I don't think this is proof either way, but the first paragraph was leaked several days ago--I read it here: http://www.mugglenet.com/app/news/show/1092/page/33 (dated July 14). Admittedly it would be tricky to incorporate it into a complete fake book that came out just a couple days later, but the possibility is still there."
,titanicsink,2007-07-20T05:55Z,"nevermind, it is real. still buying the hardcopy though. You know, JK could have been really mean if she leaked only the first couple chapters and left out the juicy parts"
,everyday17,2007-07-20T06:03Z,"@bigmaciraq:

If you look at the page in the pictures where Hermione is talking about the polyjuice potion, she says ""Goyle's potion looked like bogies"" It's just a misprint in the pdf."
,hoan999999,2007-07-20T06:34Z,Hell yeah it's real.I've read the images.
,phooey108,2007-07-20T06:43Z,"Like I  said, the plot intricately connects with all six books.
Either a fanboy/girl/man/woman charted every single plot throughout each book,threaded every character's nuance into the dialogue,adapated JKR's writing style and published the book or this is the real deal.
Each character behaves in a manner that reflects the personalities that have been meticulously developed the 6 books prior;even the little subtleties are spot on.
If it is a fake (which it isn't) I'll be happy to experience another delight come Saturday."
,wilfreda,2007-07-20T06:45Z,"Okay, since I'm in the mood to quibble, here's something that bothered me: on page 211 of this PDF, Ron uses the word ""rook"" meaning a chess piece, then adds patronizingly for Hermione, ""A castle to you."" But in the other books, Rowling (and thus Ron) uses the word ""castle"" exclusively when referring to chess. It's little things like that that make me skeptical: would Rowling change the fundamental vocabulary of her characters just to make one not-very-funny joke? I really hope not."
,wilfreda,2007-07-20T07:08Z,"Here's another one: in Order of the Phoenix, Harry says that only Death Eaters call Voldemort ""the Dark Lord,"" but in this PDF, both Ollivander and McGonagall use that name. McGonagall a Death Eater? I don't think so.

Now I'm getting more excited about the possibility of finding an entirely different story when I open my book on Saturday..."
,phooey108,2007-07-20T07:33Z,"wilfreda:If anything, that's further evidence of the book's authenticity.
In sorcerer's stone, Harry took Bishop, Ron took Knight, Hermione took what Ron called  ""Castle""."
,woosaa,2007-07-20T07:33Z,"I've finished reading this through and it seems real to me.
With that said, I've seen it mentioned on several sites that the last word in the book is supposed to be ""scar"".  This does not happen in this version.
The writing style in the epilogue also seems different from the rest of the novel."
,wilfreda,2007-07-20T07:44Z,"phooey108, the thing is, he *doesn't* initially call it a ""castle"" here. He calls it a ""rook"" first, and then tells Hermione it's a castle *to her*, implying that that's what she calls it and he doesn't. But we've already seen in the other books that it's always been a castle to *him* as well. Why would he change now? It's not natural for him to call it a rook. I think this is a small but very telling slip."
,phooey108,2007-07-20T08:00Z,"But it was a deliberate set up so that he could be nasty to Hermione. She was being pretty rude to him.
Hermione's always the one in the know, always the one explaining....
Ron wanted to exercise his knowledge, he wanted to be the one explaining......and he did so, rather nastily."
,phooey108,2007-07-20T08:03Z,"Ron calling it a ""rook"" was just his way of announcing the fact that it was ""his"" discovery."
,wilfreda,2007-07-20T08:11Z,He deliberately wanted to be nasty to Hermione after a couple of pages of him slavishly agreeing with everything she said in order to get back in her good graces after running off? And to set her up he knew in advance she would be so stupid as not to know that a rook can be either a bird or a chess piece when the thing was right in front of her eyes? I'm not totally convinced that explains it.
,wilfreda,2007-07-20T08:13Z,"Sorry, I didn't see your 2nd comment before I posted my last. How does using the word ""rook"" imply ownership of the discovery? If that's what that's supposed to mean, it was way too subtle for me."
,poolboy8,2007-07-20T08:23Z,"I love the people who insist this is a fake.  I guess they think that someone took the first paragraph that is known to be real, wrote an entire book around it, with all the complexity of a HP book, mimicking JKR's style like no fan fic has been able to do.  Then had someone illustrate each chapter perfectly matching the style of the illustrator for all the other books.  Had that book typeset and printed to match the number of pages that we know the US edition to be.  Had it bound so that he could photograph each page.  That's a lot of work.

And then they'd have to ignore all the of news reports where the publisher requests subpoenas to find the identity of the person who leaked the book, the lawsuits against the retailer who sent the book out early, the reports of some people receiving their book as early as Tuesday, not to mention the review in the NYT despite no advanced copies being sent to reviewers, and that the reviewer admits to buying an illegal copy in Times Square.

And what's their reason for tossing all of this evidence to the wind?  Because they think that the style doesn't quite match up to JKR's, or because Ron says Rook instead of Castle.

I'm guessing that the same people that think this is a fake are the same type of conspiracy theorists that believe that the Royal Family are actually alien reptiles.  Not the type of people you can talk sense into."
,phooey108,2007-07-20T08:28Z,"because in the previous books he used the accessible word ""castle"" to include the other two in the conversation
using the word ""rook"" 
I just realized...
a ""rook"" doesn't look like a castle it looks like part of a castle. Calling it a ""giant castle"" wouldn't have been instinctive."
,m4dl33tskills,2007-07-20T08:35Z,"wilfreda:

Multiple people called Voldemort the Dark Lord in books prior to Order of the Phoenix.  Most notably, Trelawney referred to him that way when she made her prophecy about Wormtail returning to Voldemort in Prisoner of Azkaban."
,wilfreda,2007-07-20T08:47Z,"Heh, I honestly am not sure whether I truly believe this is a fake or not. Logically I know it's extremely implausible that it would be fake. But as I said before, I still hope it is. Because I don't think it's very well-written. If this is the real thing, then obviously I'll have to accept that, but I'll be sad, because I don't like it that much.

As ridiculous as this will sound, I like to imagine that this is part of a huge fraud invented by Rowling's people--they had millions of dollars for security, right? They hire somebody to write a passable fake and flood the internet with it a few days early, and anybody else out there who might already have the real book figures they don't have to bother to leak it themselves. I know, it's incredibly far-fetched, but...we all love fantastic stories, right? That's why we read Harry Potter.

I will stop arguing about it here now, I know it isn't useful. On Saturday everybody can come back here and triumphantly tell me ""I told you so!"" if this turns out to be the real deal."
,daniel9,2007-07-20T09:11Z,sorry to disappoint u guys but this is fake
,norenore,2007-07-20T09:11Z,"wilfreda, the rook comment makes perfect sense. Saying, ""It looks like a castle!"" and, ""It looks like a rook!"" both elicit very different images. Harping on a single word to eliminate the veracity of a proven copy is pedantic and illogical.

Besides, are you telling me that your personal vocabulary hasn't changed in the past year, let alone seven?

There is every reason to believe that this is an actual leak of the actual book."

And for those who think its fake
The US book publisher has issued a statement this morning which reveals where a leak of Deathly Hallows occurred:

We are taking immediate legal action against DeepDiscount.com and Levy Home Entertainment. The number of copies shipped is around one one-hundredth of one percent of the total U.S. copies to go on sale at 12:01 am on July 21st.

JK Rowling has made a small update to her official website asking everyone who ""calls themselves a Potter fan"" to help keep the plot of Deathly Hallows from being spoiled:

We are almost there! As launch night looms, let's all, please, ignore the misinformation popping up on the web and in the press on the plot of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. I'd like to ask everyone who calls themselves a Potter fan to help preserve the secrecy of the plot for all those who are looking forward to reading the book at the same time on publication day. In a very short time you will know EVERYTHING!

Actually, since Rowling has been doing the ""non-Harry"" first chapter since book 5, all they would have to do was write a first chapter based on what it known, not a whole book.

As for the rest of your comment, I've read plenty of fanfic that was similar.  This book does not seem to be as good as Rowling.  If it IS her, it is easily the worst of the seven books."
