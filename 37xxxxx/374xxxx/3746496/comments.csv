,tomtom0202,2007-07-19T20:26Z,ok yes this is real first of all and yes its a lil bit of a slow download but basically i took the pirated .avi transformers and edited it with Roxio and pu in a menu and evrything so if u mount this it will run like a dvd.
,tomtom0202,2007-07-19T20:27Z,"oh btw, seeding will be very much appreciated"
,tomtom0202,2007-07-19T20:30Z,"again all this is, is the pirated .avi video of transformers that u can get at this website too but i put in a menu thats looks tight plus, its in the from of an .iso so u can just burn it to a dvd and walla! u can now play it on any dvd player!"
,caio.car,2007-07-19T20:35Z,Thank you very much tomtom0202!!!
,corndog123,2007-07-19T21:29Z,"kickass film, try and see it in the cinema once unless you want to wait for the dvd and then you got to watch it on a big screen to appreciate the CG. Quality wise this is good for a preview but again, anything smaller than a 50inch screen and perfect picture just doesn't do this movie justice!!"
,tomtom0202,2007-07-20T01:27Z,again please seed. this will be very much appreciated! ty
