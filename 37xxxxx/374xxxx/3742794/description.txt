Guns N' Roses live in Chiba City, Tokyo, Japan (2007-07-14)! An amazing show where the band shows its very best side. At the end Axl Rose even adds the song "Don't Cry" to the setlist and do an emotional stripped down version of it. This song has not been played live since 1993 when Axl's dear friend and Blind Melon frontman Shannon Hoon passed away. (Shannon can be heard on the original version of "Don't Cry" on the GN'R album Use Your Illusion I.)
