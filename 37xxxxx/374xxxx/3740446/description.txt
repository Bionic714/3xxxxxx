word of advice...if you use a player such as mplayer you may not be able to choose your audio and subtitle format. in other words the show will be in english...but, if you use vlc, then you can chose between english and japanese audio, as well as add the english subtitles. these options can be found in the video and audio menus...to change the audio go to the audio menu of vlc, and go to the part where it says audio track....to add the subtitles go to the video menu then go to the part where it says subtitle track...to change the video device (so as to play on a projector or second monitor go to the video menu and then go to video device.
