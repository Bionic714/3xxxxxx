,m1k392,2008-05-20T04:52Z,Do these work on a Nokia 6288? I dont think they do cause i put it on my mob and tried 2 install but instead it said that it is corrupt. Any chance of a guide?
,awwgoddammit,2008-07-02T14:15Z,my experience with game collections like this is that you just have to try them out. I have a nokia 5310 xpress music and I find that about 20% of the games I dl from pb will work. I haven't tried this set yet though...
