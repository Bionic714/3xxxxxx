                 Save System RAM Memory
                 ----------------------

 If you want to fine tune your system to have the fastest
 possible boot times and to use the absolute minimum amount
 of RAM memory possible, run the file included here and
 answer the 25 quick questions about how you use your system
 and what you need to have functioning, like for instance a
 printer, or webcam.

 This file is simply for disabling or enabling services.

 You will need to reboot windows after you have answered all
 the questions and the box closes.

 No changes will occur if you answer "Y" (Yes) to every
 question. You should always just answer "Y" if you are
 not sure how to answer...

 Answering "Y" will leave the service enabled (default).
 Answering "N" will disable the service.

 If you answer "N" (No) to every question, you will be left
 with only four services running! Yes FOUR SERVICES!!!!!!!!
 You would only have 11 processes running and Windows using
 about 40Mb RAM.

 The four services left running if you say no to all are: 

 ---------------------
 Event Log
 Plug and Play
 Remote Procedure Call
 Windows Audio 
 ---------------------

 Event Log cannot be stopped.

 Plug and Play should never be stopped, because this makes sure
 your devices are detected. Basically, if you were to stop this,
 then your sound card and video cards would not even be present.

 Remote Procedure Call is without a doubt the most important service
 in Windows. Almost all other services in Windows depend on this.
 This service is pretty much the service that is the core of Windows
 itself - Windows cannot possibly run without it. You cannot stop this
 RPC service... even if you were stupid enough to want to!

 Windows Audio service could be stopped, but then you would not
 have any sound in Windows at all including from media players,
 in any of your games, or anything.

 ********************** IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT DHCP ***********************

                 (This is the question about Dynamic IP)

 Be very careful if you say no to the question about having a Dynamic IP
 address. If you do have an IP address that changes, then this service is
 almost certainly needed. If you say "N" (No) to this question and get a
 network tray icon that says "Aquiring IP address" and you cannot connect
 to the internet, then it is because of DHCP being disabled.

 This DHCP should never be disabled if you install Windows in VMware,
 regardless of whether your real machine has a dynamic IP or not does
 not matter. You cannot connect to the internet in VMware if you have
 DHCP disabled... it is as simple as that.

 However, some systems just don't need DHCP enabled. I personally
 have a broadband connection that is Dial-Up (2Mbit) and I do have
 a dynamic IP address too, and yet I can just disable DHCP with no
 loss of connectivity, so it is hit and miss really. The general rule
 is, if you have a dynamic (not static) IP address then you need this
 service to be enabled - but not in all cases!
