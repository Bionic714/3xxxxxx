Yeah, right..."
,florint,2007-07-21T09:03Z,What ?
,surfboi,2007-07-21T19:32Z,"Works fine on my system.
A hassle though, to start the game..."
,trogdor!,2007-08-11T20:46Z,wowloader stands for windows-on-windows. It lets you use Vista only dlls.
,Erikssonjocke,2007-08-27T13:58Z,It works on internet ??
,Fubar22,2008-05-21T12:06Z,"Ok, can someone give me a play by play on this one?
1. Extracted
2. Mounted the HALO 2 Image
3. The confusing part....I have the loader on my desktop.  What would the file path be to run the loader and the startup simultaneously?  

**The installation is the part I don't understand**"
,Fubar22,2008-05-22T02:41Z,"ok so the path to my game is 

C:\Loader.exe E:\Startup.exe

It's still shutting down the installer after I get to the option that says the Driver is out of date.  I hit run, it shuts down without installing.  WTF is wrong with it?"
,fabe96,2008-07-05T16:43Z,ok.fine.I play the game .I choose easy and press A and...nothing.the background remains the menu disappears.what do now?wait?
,Sykotisk,2009-06-08T17:18Z,"1) Mount (or burn) the ISO.
2) Copy the folder ""XP PATCH"" from the DVD to any place in your Hard Disk (Say D:)
3) Go to Start>Run. (or use Win key + R)
4) Type the following (assuming E: is your DVD drive and D: contains ""XP PATCH"" folder)

""D:\XP PATCH\Loader.exe"" ""E:\startup.exe""

As mentioned, here
D:\XP PATCH\Loader.exe: Path where the ""Loader.exe"" exists
E:\startup.exe : Path where the startup of the game exists

5) Install the game using the Custom Install option.
6) Install XLiveRedist1.0.6027.msi and vcredist.msi from the ""redist"" directory (located within the DVD)
7) Copy the files: dwmapi.dll, mf.dll, MFPlat.dll in the directory where you installed HALO 2, from the ""XP PATCH"" directory.
8) To play the game, go to Start>Run. (or use Win key + R) and type
(Assuming the default installation directory (i.e. C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Halo 2))

""D:\XP PATCH\Loader.exe"" ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Halo 2\halo2.exe""

As before,
""D:\XP PATCH\Loader.exe"" : Path where the ""Loader.exe"" exists
""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Halo 2\halo2.exe"" : Path where the ""halo2.exe"" exists"
