After its enourmous success on the market V-Ray has become the renderer of choice in big production studios accross the world. Feature film productions, multi-million dollar game productions, huge and small architectual visualizations have trusted their visuals to V-Ray. Wouldn't you too?
V-Ray has become a benchmark for speed used by many hardware vendors and other renderer developers to test against. Richest set of features, cost-effective and production-ready


I. Architecture
(*) Object-oriented API
(*) Fully multithreaded
(*) Unified quasi-Monte Carlo sampling system
(*) Distributed rendering
(*) Efficient shading system specifically optimized for ray-tracing 	II. Geometry
(*) Efficient geometry handling
(*) On-demand geometry creation
(*) On-demand geometry loading from disk files
(*) Displacement mapping
(*) Catmull-Clark and Loop subdivision surfaces
(*) Extensible with custom geometric primitives through the V-Ray SDK

III. Image sampling
(*) Different sampling methods.
(*) Full-scene antialiasing.
(*) Progressive path tracing.
(*) Support for additional render elements (diffuse, reflection, GI etc). 	IV. Illumination
(*) Physically accurate full global illumination solutions
(*) Different GI algorithms: path tracing, irradiance cache, photon maps, light cache.
(*) Reusable GI solutins for accelerated rendering of walk-through animations.
(*) Physically accurate area lights.
(*) Extensible with custom lights through the V-Ray SDK.

V. Shaders
(*) Advanced material
(*) Blurry reflections/refractions
(*) Accurate hilights
(*) Sub-surface scattering
(*) Extensible with custom shaders through the V-Ray SDK 	VI. Camera effects
(*) Depth-of-field with bokeh effects
(*) Accurate motion blur
(*) Extensible with custom cameras through the V-Ray SDK

VII. Extras
(*) Toon effect
(*) Fur generator
(*) Extended matte/shadow capabilities
(*) Support for Render-to-Texture mode of 3dsmax 	VIII. Frame buffer
(*) V-Ray specific frame buffer with integrated color corrections and display of multiple rendering elements.
(*) Direct rendering to disk for extremely large images. Rendered images can be converted to OpenEXR files or imported back into 3dsmax.
