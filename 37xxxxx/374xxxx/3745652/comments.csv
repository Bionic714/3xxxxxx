,Minerva.TheGift,2007-11-14T22:18Z,"Thanks for the torrent! The 6 .pdf documents each have a picture of the cover and then just text for the book (not photos of a book or anything like that) which accounts for their small file size.  A few of them, like book 1, have bookmarks set up for each chapter but other ones, like book 6, don't.  In any case, this seems to truly be book 1-6 (all but the most recent) of the HP series.  Thanks again!
