,8O1R64rr,2008-04-08T23:45Z,"Thank-you for the upload, but there seem to be a few problems with the discography. Apart from that its contents are different to what Wikipedia says is the correct track listing, some white noise starts part way through `Worth Dying For'. There were some tracks that I had not heard before, but I am now going to download a different torrent for a proper discography."
,JustInsideTheGates,2008-07-01T21:04Z,i already dled but noticed no seeders so i forced it and an invalid url is whats holding this up... and theres 104 peers waiting on it so rodrigo if u can check on it i'm sure they'll appreciate it

,Spyke88,2008-12-03T17:19Z,"Kick Ass! Thanks, dude!"
,symmetrydnb,2009-01-29T04:14Z,"This isn't the full Rise Against discography. It only contains:

Generation lost
Revolutions per minute
Siren song of the counter culture
Sufferer and the witness 
The Unraveling

It doesn't contain:
Appeal to reason "
,Pyth151,2009-02-02T07:29Z,Likely because the torrent was uploaded roughly 1.5 years ago.
,LGeezy,2009-03-06T17:00Z,hah... Jackass
,SomewhatTasteful,2009-04-02T17:06Z,"Ha, stupid symmetry."

,finalresistance,2009-09-08T15:47Z,"1.5 Mb/s DL, Thanks!"

,JackaMacka,2010-03-10T13:38Z,"Awesome torrent!
Great speed too, super fast.

For those who are wondering, the songs are ripped in 128kb/s."
,FudgeSociety,2010-03-28T20:31Z,"Amazing torrent, though a little organization would be nice. But what does that matter, It's free."
,sigmareborn,2010-05-18T22:26Z,@samo if you wanna whine and cry then go buy and rip yourself stop bitching because the illegal files you downloaded for free didnt fit what you wanted
,GlycerinZ,2010-06-28T01:05Z,"If you want to know the KPBS so bad, why don't you just download a song and look at the info on it? Damn, do something on your own for once."

,TURBOTAILZ,2011-03-07T05:19Z,Or how about someone actually be helpful for once in their fucking lives and let us know the bit rate!
,b.998,2011-03-16T17:04Z,good torrent. thanks.
,Obox2550,2011-05-09T23:56Z,how is this only 172 mb? unless the songs are really bad quality. but there is no way of fitting that many songs in a discography.
,damnlian,2011-07-27T12:22Z,"WORST DISCOGRAPHY EVER.
you only have 4 of the 7 albums (/EP/minialbums etc.)"
,Heromist,2011-08-19T04:35Z,why?! i want this seperated!! why did you make it this way?!
