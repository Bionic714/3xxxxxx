,dika,2007-07-23T16:29Z,"Hey, I've been waiting for a while for this torrent to download, then took a look what's inside. There is no reason to wait, v4.0 BETA can be downloaded from Pinnacle Forum (www.pinnaclegameprofiler.com, or search google),  NoLimit Date Faker can be downloaded almost everywhere. Hovewer there were some complaints that it might contain trojan (not tried myself, it's said that AVG detects it)."

,Kowalski1977,2008-05-23T11:57Z,"@ Qbenzie where do I input this information to to unlock the Pinnacle Profiler programme as I installed this months ago and have since remained on trial period from which I uninstalled today and re-installed the beta 4 provided with this torrent. The only option I see is to ""Buy Pinnacle Now"" which takes me to the pinnacle website to purchase by paypal and fuck I certainly ain't gonna do that. Is there anywhere in the programme you can add the details you provided (given if it is for real since nobody has commented that it works yet) to have total access of the full version."
,Kowalski1977,2008-05-23T12:11Z,"Sorry I found out how and it works, hit F4 when PGP is open to access registration screen"
,Nineven,2008-06-08T20:05Z,"Thx for this Qbenzie but the registration information doesn't work anymore.

Look like the admin ""cancelled"" it :("
,bahamutnyne,2008-06-10T16:24Z,LIES!!!@nineven Qbenzies info works perfect atleast it did for me (XP user) and u have 2 enter it exactly as he has it shown i entered the unlock key in all CAPS just liek he has it showna nd now it works just fine
,Nineven,2008-06-13T19:29Z,"It's not a lie.
For me it worked too some days, then it stop working and it tell me that the registration information is bad, i tryed to enter it again, didn't work...

If for you it still working then i will try to uninstall and install again."
,Nineven,2008-06-13T21:17Z,"Ok still not working -.-

,Nineven,2008-06-14T03:58Z,"oO thanks anonymouse50

I'm very suprise because the first time i registered it, i have put a space and it worked some days like this.

Strange."
,ll_TheAnswer_ll,2008-07-12T08:17Z,"Thanks very much for the key, worked perfectly."
,CyberCat,2008-09-18T20:10Z,"Hmm, the generic data faker patch doesn't seem to work with this program, Pinnacle gets an error saying it's ""being launched by an authorized source"". Also the serial provided by Qbenzie seems to work, however once you restart the program it reverts to trial status again (even though in the about it still says registered... and yes this is without the space in the name), it seems you can re-register as many times as you like with the serial, but it's pretty annoying to have to re-enter such a complicated serial every time you want to use the program. =/ I think I'll stick with xpadder (freeware alternative) until we can get a better solution here..."
,knok44,2008-10-14T02:19Z,"thanks a ton Qbenzie. now i can play Bia:HH the same way that i do on my desktop, and MOH:AA on my laptop. "
,TheColdTruth,2008-11-03T07:42Z,"This torrent's patch doesn't work at all, but the above registration info provided by Qbenzie works perfectly with the latest download from the pinnacle website.  "
,MCantis,2008-11-06T19:53Z,"Umm... Tried Qbenzie's info, it works but it comes with the 15-minute crap. How to fix it? No matter if I uninstall it, the info just stays. How the hell should I log out, or how to fix the registration?"
,MCantis,2008-11-16T20:19Z,"BLOODY HELL, HOW THE F CAN THIS CRAP WORK? THE BLOODY INFO JUST RUINS YOUR LIFE AND STAYS IN IT! How to remove it???"
,mariobeans,2008-11-22T07:49Z,IM GETTING THE SAME PROBLEM AS MCANTIS!! I ENTER IN THE REGISTRATION INFO AND IT ACCEPTS IT BUT STILL AFTER 15 MINUTES IT STOPS!!! AHHHH I WANNA PLAY THE OLD TOMB RAIDER WITHOUT THE KEYBOARD!!! THE CONSOLE CONTROLS ARE SHITTY ENOUGH!!
,Advize,2008-12-13T00:00Z,Install it and patch it. Then use the NoLimit 2.0 application to make pinnacle think the date is earlier than when the serial expired. Noobs.
,geneofargo,2009-01-07T21:52Z,"@ Jeff71

And the writer continues to make a living because of honest(ly retarded) people like you. I'd rather spend my money on food and rent."
,MCantis,2009-01-19T21:13Z,"@ Advize:

Bollocks, that NoLimit crap is from 1999! I'd try it again, but the bloody info just stays in my PC and it counts that the freakin program is already registered..."
,row123,2009-01-21T08:14Z,"still doesn't work, after 15 min, it stops no matter what.

this thing didnt even give me 30 days from the site either, just a couple of days max."
,foreverflash,2009-02-09T17:05Z,"Thank you very much steve136 and especially Qbenzie. Your registration information STILL works flawlessly. I entered it exactly as you showed in your post and restarted Pinnacle; now the trial meter is gone and it's fully registered!

To all who said it doesn't work: This post I'm making verifying the crack's authenticity is long after you made your posts claiming Qbenzie's crack doesn't work. "

,Shihuru,2009-08-01T08:34Z,"No registration info really matters. Just you  can't see the trial counter doesn't mean it isn't still a trial. I put in the registration info Qbenzie gave, and i still can only play a game for 15 minutes before i have to restart PGP..."
,Shihuru,2009-08-01T19:35Z,I can't believe no one has found or made a crack for this program!!!
,xxxdave666,2009-08-06T01:44Z,doesnt work trial is gone its registerd but it still stops after 15 minutes of play what a pain in the ass
,Hyperion888,2009-08-20T22:55Z,"Don?t download this shit. it corrupts game files and it is really nasty.

,T.T.C,2010-05-11T06:10Z,"DUDES~! I got it to work!

Follow these steps:

1: DO NOT USE NoLimits, IT DOES NOT WORK!!!
2: Install PGP.
3: Disconnect internet.
4: Enter registration info (It is the quintan corder thing, but DO NOT PUT A SPACE BETWEEN ""quintancorder""!!!)
5: After finished, exit PGP.
6. Open PGP, then after it boots, connect internet.
7. Go to regedit.exe, and search for PGP_DATA.
8. Change the date key (should be like this: 05/10/10) last two digits to 99.
9. Have FUN!!!

This works, I've been playing for two hours now!!! I'll post this on the other torrents too!!!

,andiste81,2010-12-18T15:59Z,"that code thing does work..u kno the quintcorder or whatever n the magic co,lour yellow n blablabla.....its cracked mine anyhoo....if it dont youras just uninstall it all then reinstall n do it"
,wilkshyre,2011-03-17T18:22Z,"Been fighting this pinnacle profiler for a couple weeks now and honestly there are two ways you can do this if you want to use a controller for free.

1. DO NOT enter in the quintan corder info, it DOES NOT work, pinnacle must have patched the game specifically for this user bc although it will appear that it worked, in actuality it doesn't, and after 30 days it will stop working, plus it will get lodged in your registry and you will have to do a deep scrub of it searching out every entry of Pinnacle, KalinkoSoft, and Power Up Gaming. Although this only took me 20 or so minutes to complete it is still a pain in the ass.

So if you want to use pinnacle DL the trial from their site and use it normally, when your thirty days is almost up use REGEDIT and search PGP_DATA, when it comes up select the first run entry and set it to a day or two before the actual date, i.e. if it is March 20th, set the first run to March 19, and so on. DO NOT CHANGE THE YEAR.

This will trick pinnacle into thinking there are X amount of days left on your trial. You will have to do this each time you want to use it and it is kinda a pain in the ass also, but it works and it is free.

Your other options are A. Buy it B. DL XPadder, it is free, not as intiuitive, but works just as well. It is kind of a bitch to set up but once i got it working everything was smooth as could be.

Not a spammer or some dickless lizard working for XPadder, just a fellow traveller who has grown sick of trying to make fucking pinnacle work.

Cheers All."
,mahnito69,2012-02-22T18:45Z,its simple .... run PGP ... press F4 ... and put all info .... from torrent
