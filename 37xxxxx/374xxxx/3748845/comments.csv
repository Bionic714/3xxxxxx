,jueljuel,2007-07-21T22:08Z,WOW thaks a lot!! I've been wanting that for a long time ;-)
,flightcrazy,2007-07-21T22:33Z,"I have some more scenery, VFR photographic scenery for wales and south-west england if you want me to upload it"
,flightcrazy,2007-07-21T22:56Z,"Okay guys, im uploading VFR photographic scenery mentioned below so watch out for it in the next 1-2 hours!

NJ"
,neslesman,2007-07-21T22:57Z,"Thanks you for the upload but I just can't imagine using it with UT, Photo Scenery and custom mesh.  There already are just too many things fighting with one another.
Here's some FAQs
hXXp://www.justflight.net/moreinfo.asp?pid=62"
,flightcrazy,2007-07-21T23:19Z,"This is compatible with any scenery upgrade etc that i know of, and it also puts the roads and coastlines abit closer to what they should be like in the VFR series.

NJ"
[T],stevekasian,2007-07-22T00:36Z,"neslesman: According to the link you posted, there should be no conflicts - things shouldn't be ""fighting with one another"".

Enhanced terrain mesh should be an asset to this package, and photomesh should nullify it where rendered.

,flightcrazy,2007-07-22T01:05Z,"SK, anything you want or need for FS9 at the moment?


I have some more ac and scenery if you want me to upload them for you?"
,neslesman,2007-07-22T02:22Z,Well in that case I guess guys I had better give it a try................thanks.
[T],stevekasian,2007-07-22T02:35Z,"flightcrazy: Thanks man, I think I've got just about everything I can think of :-) I'm sure there's lots I'm missing, but I have to see the titles B4 I recognise it as somethin I need.

I am a major photoscenery junkie, so anything you've got that's obscure & off the beaten path I'm down for. I just can't think of any I don't have. I gues that's one reason I make my own ;-) I'll upload some of them here once I finish them. Lots of work to make 'em presentable tho, as I'm a perfectionist."
[T],stevekasian,2007-07-22T02:36Z,One thing's for sure - they won't look anything like Tucson Photoreal. What a shitty job that guy did to get an AVSIM award. lol
,flightcrazy,2007-07-22T09:26Z,"You know iv'e remodelled my local airfield once (EGFE), added 2 helipads, and extra grass runway, proper parking, fuel station and a proper tower. 

Once i'd finished it i went to put it into the scenery in FS, so i did that, then the bloody thing wouldn't load :-(

That was a shitty job yeh, if you're going to do a flight, you would atleast like to see your house or town centre in good view and detail whilst 15,00ft or above .

And i do have some other scenery packs, 2 other VFR scenery packs, but i can't think where they've wondered off to."
,Panodilo,2007-07-22T15:59Z,"Last april, as a prank, I modelled a collossal cock in gMax and installed it on my brother's rig at an upcoming destination on our round the world flight. I also changed his keyboard setup, so when he hit the landing gear button he actually shut down all engines. It was amusing to watch my brother trying to focus while gliding with his 747, trying to dodge that enormous cock blocking most of Frankfurt. Good times, good times..."
,flightcrazy,2007-07-22T20:14Z,"HAHA good prank!

sorry bout this guys but due to complaints from other users on LAN, i won't be able to restart seeding untill 2100 tonight!"

,buffybill,2007-07-23T09:01Z,"If you or anyone has VFRVolume1 East & South East England to go along with this I would be eternally gratefull. I have nearly everything for fs9 EXCEPT these scenerys for the UK, and to be honest I never thought I'd see them up here again. "
,flightcrazy,2007-07-23T13:17Z,"I do have them....downstairs in a box, under more boxes with clothes in. But im searching it out today, so if i find it, i'll upload it
