Here's another "gem" from David Allen Coe, plus two other
singles that were on the jukeboxes in some of the ritzy 
establishments I hung out in back in the 80's, such as:
Kelley's in "beautiful downtown Penngrove", California,
"The Spa" in Petaluma, CA, and, The Wooden Horse 
"The world's worst bar", in Saratoga, CA

David Allen Coe - The Devil Went Down To Jamaica (2:42)
Gerry Lee and the Showdown - The Rodeo Song (1:57)
August and the Lost Horizons Band - The I-95 ("A$$hole") Song (3:07)

When SeedSpiller posts MP3's, instead of FLACs, LOOK OUT! :)
