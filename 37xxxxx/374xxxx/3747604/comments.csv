,joeslacker08,2007-07-26T16:42Z,need more seeders there is only one!
,gongfarmer,2007-07-29T00:43Z,"lets see.... no seeds, 80+ peers stuck at 78%.
If I try to download this I would be a cunt. Afterglow88 are you calling me a cunt? "
,gongfarmer,2007-07-29T20:44Z,"DON'T DOWNLOAD. It's an aborted torrent. both mininova and torrentz have a couple good ones that download in about 4 hrs. 

(and as usual the manga is way better than the anime IMHO.) "
,afterglow88,2007-07-30T02:20Z,"hello everybody, sorry i have not seeded for a couple of days.
I promise i will seed for many night now until the seed is good.

When it is i planning to seed the manga in PDF format, i think it's easier to read it in adobe acrobat, so if anyone is intrested i will seed the manga as PDF files."
,afterglow88,2007-07-30T02:22Z,by the way my internet connection is slow so it will take some time but please have patience.
,Rezagrats,2007-10-06T21:00Z,"hey, how about splitting the .rar so it's not just one massive file, and we could download select files instead of the whole thing, yeah?"
,plast2,2007-10-13T14:14Z,"This is an amazing peace of work. When thinking of all the work that went into this.... Thank you so much. I for one, am truly thankful :)"
,DannOrly,2007-11-02T02:50Z,"Rezagrats, you ungrateful POS, if you don't like it, download the whole file and then seed the directory in a separate torrent. 

afterglow88, thank you so much for the upload. I've enjoyed these so much, I'll continue to seed this as long as I can :) "
,afterglow88,2007-11-13T00:36Z,"Thanks, i was planning some time ago to seed this in PDF files for reading i acrobat reader, but just when i finished converting the files, my computer crashed:("
