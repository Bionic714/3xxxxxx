,mflp,2007-07-29T17:49Z,"***!!!FAKE!!!***
Most people have probably already guessed this, but this is a fake! Erection's been flowing around the net for a long time, and it's just another fake, just like Splitting The DNA, The Document and the Conspiracy Theory albums"
,matanpizda,2007-07-31T14:01Z,"what do you mean by fake?it's them singing.i have the fuckin album.it's not fake.i searched this on a couple of trackers and didn't find it.i don't like linkin park,so that is why i upload it,for you to see what crap they can make.and as i said it's NOT a new album,i have the album for about 2 or 3 years.i just didn't find it on trackers"
