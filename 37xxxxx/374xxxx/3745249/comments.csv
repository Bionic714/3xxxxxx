,rHBa,2007-07-18T00:34Z,"Judging by the file size I'd say this is exactly the same DL as the last three.

@Genius25
Next time I'd check what's already been UL'd before wasting a whole hour of your precious time..."
,Genius25,2007-07-18T00:43Z,"I did, and all the other ones were either .PDF's or where ""The Seventh Horcrux"".. this is neither. This is photos taken of the book!"
,Jakkimato,2007-07-18T00:57Z,"Just to remind, the publisher (Scholastic) of the book is gonna put a lot of effort to punish the guy who scanned the book or uploaded it in internet before the date of publication. Hope u are not gonna get in trouble, cos i'm just downloading this :D"
,tekmonkey,2007-07-18T01:00Z,I read through the first couple hundred pages. It's definitely not Rowling's writing.
,kitfox69,2007-07-18T02:27Z,This is an elaborate fake as this ends at page 759 and the US version is confirmed at 784 pages. Also this book is registered at the Library of Congress under Joanne Kathleen Rowling whereas all the other potter books are registered to J. K. Rowling.
,laddiebuck,2007-07-18T02:40Z,"If you look closely, there are only a handful of positions that the hand and book are in. One of the more blatant examples is pages 7 and 8, in which the pages and hand are in precisely the same position, but the text is different. A fairly elaborate hoax, but even if you only had the text, you would suspect this by the writing style.

(Not to mention it contradicts a bit of information previously revealed in interviews.)"
,laddiebuck,2007-07-18T02:43Z,"Although to debunk the previous post, the book is actually registered under ""J.K.Rowling"" not ""Joann Kathleen"", as claimed.

Of course, it'd be pretty silly if this turned out to be the real book after all. :)"
,kitfox69,2007-07-18T02:56Z,Wrong... look again. There is no Deathly Hallows under H. K. Rowling. The only Deathly Hallows shows up under the Joanne Kathleen Rowling application. Pay attention people... match up the numbers from the copyright pageto the 8th link on the Library of congress page. ( search for rowling under authors and creators)
,kitfox69,2007-07-18T02:57Z,Edit Meant J. K. Rowling.
,SyluxReaper,2007-07-18T09:08Z,"I've finished the book, and this is not fanfiction. Be kinda cool if it was, since the book seemed so real. Be like getting 2 book 7s. Although I do admit that the first few hundred pages don't seem very Rowling-y, you have to realize that the Harry Potter we're used to always is at Hogwarts, so it's natural that when he's not surrounded by that setting and people, it might seem a little off.

Damn I wish the book was out so I could talk to other people about it; it's very debatable. Yet I feel like I must keep a secret... =l"
,m.m.,2007-07-18T11:54Z,pls seed
,KingDukeman,2007-07-18T22:21Z,i cant figure out how to open the dumb file...please help
,zascherl,2007-07-20T03:06Z,"search for 7zip on google click on the first site download the app, then get in explore right click on the file and and there will be a 7zip box with an arrow click on extract files extract them, there might be a second file in side so you might have to extract that one as well"
,sinisterminister,2007-07-20T05:49Z,"if it isnt the real version, then why is scholastic so angry over this one, but not over any of the other fakes?"
,cdmartin,2007-07-20T20:48Z,I am new to this - can anyone explain to me how to download a file please?
