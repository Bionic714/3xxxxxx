,carv,2007-07-20T01:06Z,RubberTow why don't you wait for a torrent to be well seeded before uploading more... the speed you are delivering this stuff is terrible... it is going to take months to get a copy of any of these. 
,RubberTow,2007-07-26T04:56Z,"Because none of my torrents seed fast. And it is not the amount of torrents I upload that is the problem. The bandwidth problem is caused by my downloads which are all ready uploading as I download them. In order tfro me to seed better, I would have to shut them off and I can't, all I can do is slow them down slower than my seeding files, which I've down, but I am downloading so much that it still has no affect. All my uploads are slow. If you have any suggestions on how I should run Utorrent, you can email me at RAWise2@cfl.rr.com"

,RubberTow,2007-08-19T06:44Z,I can't find much of Sybils stuff either. I got a good copy of The Howling in a torrent though. I'm curious about your interest. It isn't her acting is it? I plan to do more of her stuff in which she has a prominent role sans clothing. Also I've compromised and have decreased my downloading to allow more bandwidth to uploading. I also remove torrents when the seeds get into double digits.

,yolt13,2008-09-17T00:32Z,"NEED HELP WITH SIDARIS FILMS! 

Looking for Andy Sidaris' early films, STACEY and SEVEN (aka SEVANO'S SEVEN). The only place online to get them is Cinemageddon, but when I try to register there, they don't send me a confirmation email. If anyone out there has these movies, or is a Cinemageddon members and can get them, please upload them to Pirate Bay! I'll be eternally grateful, and I'll seed indefinitely!

Please help! Thanks!"
