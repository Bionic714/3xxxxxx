Synopsis
Eddie Murphys got the bite in this movie mix of bone-chilling horror and chill-out comedy directed by Wes Craven (A Nightmare on Elm Street). As the vampire Maximillian, the popular star is the most diabolical, dashing and definitely undead dude in the hood. To add to the macabre fun, Murphy morphs into two other must-see characters: a paunchy preacher and a fast talking thug. Angela Basset (Waiting to Exhale, Whats Love Got To Do With It) plays the cop whose world is rocked by Maximillians attempts to make her his mate for eternity. And Kadeem Hardison (TVs A Different World) is the haplessly decaying vampires sidekick who (a hand here, and ear there) is forever losing things. Brooklyn may be home to the undead now that Max is around-but means its livelier than ever!
