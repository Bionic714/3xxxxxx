,bilditup1,2007-07-23T00:56Z,Thanks a lot for this; can't believe it came out so quickly actually.  I pulled an all-nighter last night finishing the book (took me total 14-15hrs to read) and lent it to my little brother to read. This way I can reread on my old Clie. I must confess the smaller page version is much better in terms of formatting than the other one...not that it's matter much to those still on Palm 4.0
