,melfice26,2007-08-03T10:02Z,I agree. haha.
,Bamimi,2007-08-18T00:36Z,"well just think in a few months the manga will be caught up to the end of the tv series, and you can read that. it was and is a great series, I really don't know why they don't have the foresight to continue the tv series of it. Then again you could learn to read japanease real quick and read all the way up to volume 51, or chapter 517. heh, go for it."
,Shedim,2007-08-28T16:34Z,"That was an annoying end to it all.. Why the heck didnt they complete it, like properly?"

,Riyse,2008-01-30T09:20Z,"This may sound dumb...But how do I take all the files on a volume and put them on a DVD so it shows the menu and the buttons work? I burnt it, and it plays everything out of order, and it doesn't have the menu working.
Any help is appreciated, thanks!"
