,sgt_solo,2007-07-22T13:22Z,lol seed its suddenly stopped at 59%
,black curtian,2007-07-27T08:37Z,"its not a shit program...it stopped because the uploader is a piece of shit and is not seeding it, probably only seeded it for a few days and expects downloaders to keep the seed going. if your gonna upload you should seed the file for at least a month.  as well the 23 who downloaded it are nothing but leechers...down it and forget it, sooner or later they will be banned from the tracker. trackers watch URL's that dont seed to a ratio of at least 1.0 (which means seeding the same amount of bytes that you downed)  when a tracker finds a url that constantly will not seed to the ratio it will ban the url and refuse to down to it.
