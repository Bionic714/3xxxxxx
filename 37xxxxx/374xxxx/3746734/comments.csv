,420dopeman,2007-07-21T03:57Z,"Dont worry it mate, imo the patch does nothing, I do not use it, and experience bug-free gaming.

In fact, I recommend only using it if experiencing a problem with version 1.0.

,DrStrix,2007-07-21T12:20Z,Runs fine without patch :)
,Fragmaster158,2007-07-21T21:44Z,"a very important note from Dopeman the king of P2P 


 Greetings fellow pirates.

 There is indeed a new enemy amongst torrents and they are trying to control
 all good gaming torrents everywhere. Leeching and dumping data, not sharing
 a bit of data, which is making it near impossible to download many torrents.

 I have included a dopeman_blocklist.txt file. YOU MUST load this file to
 Peerguardian as an addtional blocklist -or- load the file to whatever means
 of IP blocking you have available to your BT Client.

 If you do not, you will simply be sharing data to these cowards and not other
 legit torrent users trying to download. 

 Please try to understand the importance of this. It must be used to begin
 saving game torrents everywhere. This is a new enemy. We must do our best 
 to fight back to preserve our freedom of sharing. 

 Please use the blocklist and share it anyway you can.
