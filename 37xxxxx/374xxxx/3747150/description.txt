Finally the first proper release! A fork from the popular theopencd.org, this software is aimed directly at students aged 10-21+ giving the necessary tools to help them complete homework/coursework assignments and succeed in school without the need for rich/generous parents/guardians to buy them the tools they need, or having to resort to piracy.  This is the first proper release and most of the spelling, grammar, navigation and layout issues should have been fixed from the betas.  A lot of product pages have been updated with more kid friendly speech, some graphics have been revamped, and new versions of several applications are included (see changes below). Please help out by giving to friends, family, enemies and school teachers.  Help make education accessible for all.

Open Office

All software should be used in accordance with its own licence and we can take no responsibility for what this cd may do to your machines!  Though I doubt that a html cd can do very much.

Please feel free to distribute to friends, family, enemies and school teachers/technicians.

Everything here runs on the Windows operating system, each program has different specs, check them out their own websites.  Feedback to openeducationcd (atttter)  yahoo (dottter) com   Thanks!
