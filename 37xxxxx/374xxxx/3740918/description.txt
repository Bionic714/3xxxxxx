This book/DVD package, designed for beginning fiddle students, presents basic techniques in 36 lessons by applying them to fiddle tunes. Reading music is unnecessary, as the lessons are explained step by step, and fingerings are given for every note. Each version builds on the previous one and helps students to create their own arrangements. 

The DVD with this set is designed to complement the first 17 lessons of the You Can Teach Yourself Fiddling text. Covers tuning, holding the fiddle and bow, left-hand position, basic A, D, and G scales, shuffle bowing, slurs, double stops, and many tunes, including \"Liza Jane,\" \"Shortening Bread,\" \"Going to Boston,\" and \"Bile Them Cabbage Down.\"
