,NisseP,2008-01-07T07:01Z,Very smart to set up a stupid URL that doesn't work for everyone! ASSHOLE
,DrussRob,2008-02-04T06:28Z,"This is another ""download and follow these instructions, go to blah blah site and sign up"".

Well, I've done it three times and no password. Don't waste your time."
,matts8008,2008-02-29T15:09Z,"Password is ""you!"""
,wasp88,2008-04-01T06:11Z,"Cheers for the pw, matts8008!"
,tpg-chaos,2008-06-05T09:04Z,"I honestly have no idea why you guys are talkin about a password cos I never put one there in the first place.

If you have to 'sign-up' to some website, you shouldnt need to cos I have no idea how you got to it in the first place.

There is one file to download in this torrent and 147 files total once it is extracted. To install them, check out the description on this page.

I hope that clears up some issues people are having.. if you'd like a direct link mirror for the file, let me know and I'll sort that out. Cheers."
,snathi,2008-11-30T19:42Z,"I had no problem with this torrent.  The rar file had no password.

,G. Robert,2009-01-29T16:12Z,Thanx a lot!
,tototoo,2009-06-16T05:11Z,"Yup. There is NO password, URL or anything else. It is exactly as described by the original poster."
