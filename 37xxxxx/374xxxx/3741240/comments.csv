So unless you have a lot of time to waste trying to get these to work I would suggest downloading from a different ripper.

The logic of this guy eludes me. Why share files that very few people seem to be able to play.

I would advise downloading from a different ripper. It will save you a lot of bandwidth and a whole lot of hassle. Prolific he may be, but quantity is no substitute for quality."

Just use TSMuxer to demux the files and then MKVMergeGUI to make a MKV that will play in most players. In the process of demuxing and remuxing you can add or remove audio or subtitles to suit your needs.

With all that said, I would only get HDTV China's rips for videos I really enjoy. For so-so ones, a regular 4GB 720p or 8GB 1080p rip is fine."
