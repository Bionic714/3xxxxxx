,allthegoodnamesaretaken,2008-07-24T01:48Z,"awesome, thank you so much...downloading & seeding"
,xjupiterx,2008-09-03T20:54Z,"last man on earth is Loudon Wainwright, not Rufus. Also, it says 'first albium' which should be fixed or just changed to 'Rufus Wainwright' or 'Self-Titled'. Thanks for the torrent."
,BardoftheOzarks,2008-12-02T17:31Z,"I've heard of a few of this guy's songs in various movies, but I've just recently looked up more of his works.  He's almost a swoon singer, but at the same time, not really.  Thanks for the upload."
,mgmac,2009-09-27T23:08Z,"Rufus in high school prom terms is like not the hottest chick that showed up, but she's the one you're going to marry. He doesn't make you swoon all the way. No, he makes you swoon only 3/4 of the way, and he keeps the rest personal and real. A complete swoon would have entailed sociopathic behavior. 

And I have no idea why I said that. 

Thank you for this. "
,bralexa,2010-01-07T04:04Z,does anyone know where the hell to get his version of Hallelujah please tell me i love that song but cant find it anywhere
,scottyau,2010-01-30T08:51Z,Easiest way is to look for the Shrek soundtrack - it's on that.
