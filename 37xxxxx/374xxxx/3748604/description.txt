                [Release Notes]
        The album opens with the indisputable highlight of the 
        score: a four-minute-and-a-half exploration of the Silver 
        Surfer Theme. Warped and whispery synthesized sounds 
        establish the otherworldly origin of the silver entity, 
        while the theme itself, a constant unresolved pull 
        between the V and VI chords, is an at times noble, at times 
        menacing minor mode melody, often played by the strings 
        and trombones. As the piece progresses, so does the theme's 
        ominousness, with the fading out of the theme proper in 
        favor of towering hits by the orchestra and choir (and 
        sometimes electric guitars) on the alternating chords. This 
        triple-meter theme is a giant ticking clock, heralding the 
        coming of the Devourer of Worlds, a distant cousin to 
        Gustav Holst's "Saturn, the Bringer of Old Age". A 
        brilliant overture for the album and quite simply the best 
        musical representation of the Silver Surfer.
