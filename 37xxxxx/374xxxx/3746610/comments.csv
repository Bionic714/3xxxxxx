,Pirumyan,2008-10-30T09:18Z,"I bought the first 2 lessens, which cost me $191.00 and i wanted to get the 3rd one, so i downloaded this, thanks so much for the upload but i wish the 3rd lessen would be of a better quality. Well whatever, it's still the best way to learn a language. I Will try to upload the other 2 lessens which i have and are of a excellent quality."

,molva,2009-12-21T17:04Z,"Pimsleur's method is excellent; no deadweight chatter, just learning to talk, with a good balance between new stuff & reviewing. I much prefer it to Michael Thomas, but YMMV..."

,QWESTSUX,2012-05-17T23:33Z,"I love the way people caveat their downloading of an illegal file. I have this but...just wanted to try it out....I'm a fan now and am going to buy 100s of dollars of CDs now.

I just DLd http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7223146/The_Avengers_2012_CAM_V2_XViD-26K and this is one of the only files that I will not use until I see the 3D theatre version"
