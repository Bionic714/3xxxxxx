Is there a special way to burn the software on to a cd-r?  If not could someone that had succes possibly post me a copy of the software that you have already downloaded that works. I have been trying to get this software for months as the CNCD 20 witch i have is soo old and doesnt now any roads i seem to use lol. Thank you very much, regards "
,Doddrudi,2008-12-14T01:03Z,Is this working on a Pioneer Avic-x1bt???
,bjarkijod,2009-04-05T13:26Z,"If you guys burn it with Alcohol120% then it works perfectly. I tried first using Nero and MagicISO, they did not work, only Alcohol120%. 

There is nothing wrong with the download, it just matters what program you use!"
