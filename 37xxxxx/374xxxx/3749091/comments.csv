,dank_nug,2009-01-07T09:50Z,this game is so kick ass. i remember playing it years ago when i was a kid. thanks! thats badass that it doesnt need a serial or anything
,dank_nug,2009-01-08T02:55Z,so i just finished downloading and installed it...everything works just how i remember. just run the auto runfile in the setup folder.the only problem i had was that the graphics are all messed up on my skilldex numbers and it looked the same on this one cutscene. im trying to restart the game and see if it happens anymore..
,dank_nug,2009-01-08T03:08Z,actually all you have to do is switch your color settings from 32 bit to 16bit
