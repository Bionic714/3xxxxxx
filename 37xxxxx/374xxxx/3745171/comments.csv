,kgj6000,2007-07-17T23:11Z,"Freeze: Well, sometimes you should use a photo editing programm like gimp (more contrast, less brightness)..."
,red456,2007-07-17T23:18Z,this is a complete fake. don't waste your time. death to the fakers.
,AnSuFoX,2007-07-17T23:19Z,this one is the same as the other. A bit to bright but if you zoom in you can read it. Currently on page 36 and enjoying it :D cheers!

,homo_unge,2007-07-17T23:53Z,"This is the Real Shit, I've been looking forward for ages to read this book, thank you mate !

                             BUT
Like the other commentors have already said, the quality is bad (but not unreadable :D).

Cheers"

,the_larch,2007-07-18T00:12Z,Book starts from page 11 at Bayimg. Look for at quite red thumbnail.
,big_raji,2007-07-18T01:05Z,"UGH. I have a headache from trying to read this. I have 20/20 vision, and a large 22"" monitor, and it's still *BARELY* readable.

I gave up when I saw that page 30 was completely out of focus and absolutely unreadable. (IMG_3646.jpg)

Thanks for the effort, but I'll wait for something better..."
,Prometheusfire,2007-07-18T08:06Z,"Finely! This is the real deal fellow pirates! Quality is sorta iffy but if you turn your screen right its actually fairly easy to read. Here's to having it 4 days before the masses.
Thanks"
,jgabriel,2007-07-18T08:34Z,"Mesozder: ""Enjoy reading""

Thanks, Mesozder, I will. 

You see, I always read the last few pages, or the last chapter, first anway. 

It's a freaking book, you moron! Not a fucking movie. You read it for the words and the story. 

In my case, I always find that checking out the end is a great to judge whether the book is worth reading, and if so, let's me read it for its merit, rather than just the plot.

And the details you gave tell us nothing. Was Snape or Wormtail redeemed? Did Malfoy turn on Voldemort? How did the others die? What about Tonks & Lupin? 

Since I checked the end already, I know the answers to most of these questions.  I'm not gonna share, cause not everyone likes to know the end first the way I do. 

But if you were trying to ruin it for other people, I suspect you failed. After all, you didn't give us the how, or the why. You didn't give us the *story*.  And that's what we're reading for, man. Not the plot or the ending. 

The story.

And you can't ruin that, because the only way to get the story is to read it.

,mgcopenhotmail,2007-07-18T16:07Z,What do you guys open the .jpg files with.. for me they are completly empty.
,mgcopenhotmail,2007-07-18T16:17Z,Well it doesn't matter.. I am gona buy the book anyways.. So I just wait the 2 days.
,bdc52004,2007-07-18T18:49Z,"I have hard time believing this is real since Mesozder states that Dumbeldore is alive. JK has stated several times that is not alive and it is not a trick. He infact is dead.

This is from Muggelnet.com from an interview they did with JK-

""Dumbledore IS really dead. ""Everyone needs to move through the five stages of grief"" and get past his death. She also apologizes to DumbledoreIsNotDead.com for ruining the purpose of their site.""

So with saying he is alive would lead me to believe this is a good fake."
,lord_death,2007-07-18T19:02Z,readable?
,kgj6000,2007-07-18T20:59Z,Yes... it is readable. But you should edit it a bit with gimp (i use tghumb) for less brightness and more contrast.
,dethspunj,2007-07-19T01:40Z,"Dumbledore IS dead, voldermort takes the special super wand from his tomb to try nad take it's power, but the real owner is draco who had the wand taken by harr, who is the real master of the wand, so voldermort can't kill him with it. Haryy talks to dumbledors portrait and them re-buries wand with the old timer... after using it's great powers to mend his broken wand."
,pearljamaussie,2007-07-19T10:35Z,If you cant zoom and read that then ur eyes r fucked! nothing wrong with it ya fuckin whinging pussies.
,Tink9,2007-07-19T13:57Z,"This either has to be an elaborate hoax or the worst book Rowling has ever written. The most obvious reason is that the book contradicts itself.  In the beginning of the book, Hermonie explains how she used a memory charm to get her parents into hiding.  Several chapters later she says that she has never done a memory charm (in the cafe with the death eaters).  Rowling would not contradict herself like that.  It is, however, a very good looking hoax."
,Klacek,2007-07-19T16:42Z,"Fucking fake. They have already told us that only two (2) will die in this book. Also check the last word. I won't download this crap but please tell what the last word in the last chapter is. The absolutely last word in the story is going to be ""scar"". So please tell us what the last word is now!"
,herrgurka,2007-07-19T17:41Z,"The two last sentences is ""The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well."" :-D"
,thanu7,2007-07-19T21:20Z,Whi will die???
,ZeXoR,2007-07-19T23:29Z,"listen you stupid fucks. The last word aiin gonna be scar. That was what JK.R said in her last interviu (sry my bad english). It's gonna be something that is going to start with a D.

SO SCREW YOU MOTHAPHAKKAS THAT WANNA SPOIL IT FOR EVERYBODY BUT DOESN'T NOW YOU ARE COMPLETLY FUCKING WRONG.

The book will be realised in a few days, more exactly, in 36 h. 

And again, sry my bad english."
,5aber,2007-07-21T11:17Z,How did you open it. which software did you use?
,bemyhorny,2007-07-21T11:47Z,"It is the real deal!!

I have the original printed book and it is the same as this copy!

However it is easier to read the real book!!"
