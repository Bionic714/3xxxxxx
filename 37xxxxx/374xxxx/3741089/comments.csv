,Olive74,2007-07-24T13:47Z,Is there french version in ?
,badgerblitz,2007-07-29T16:43Z,"I don't know if there's a french version.  Actually I'm just glad this worked.  It's my first torrent, and after a couple weeks of no no activity I wasn't sure I had done this right; but apparently some of you downloaded it successfully.  The system works!"
,D_Macius,2007-08-06T11:53Z,Downloads fine but doesn't run on my MacBook Pro. Crashes every time I open. 
,Dientologo,2007-08-07T02:29Z,Does not work on my MacBook with Intel Core 2 Duo... :-(
,badgerblitz,2007-08-07T05:27Z,"Sorry 'D Macius' & 'Dientologo', I never worried about the specs because I never had problems. The attached ""read me"" only says you need Mac OS 10.1 (it's from June 2004). I'm running it on a PowerPC G5 with Mac OS 10.4, never crashes.  As I've said, I'm a newbie, and this is still my first torrent.  I wish I could help you with compatibility issues, but I'm not running Intel. Good luck to the rest of you!  Cheers!"

,Nabooly,2008-01-12T03:49Z,"Ive downloaded this but when i go to open Scrabble, it gives me a black screen then crashes. 

Running on a 2.16 ghz imac c2d. 10.4.11 "
,Mooney79,2008-01-27T06:24Z,"At first I couldnt get this to work on my PPC Powerbook G4. Copyed the app to the applications folder and mounted the disc. When i tried to run it, I got a black screen and it crashed like Nabooly's comment. I got it to work, so anyone who hasnt gotten it can try this. Make a folder in applications called ""scrabble"" copy entire .dmg contents to this folder. Make sure the disc is mounted when u run scrabble from the scrabble folder. Hope this helps."
