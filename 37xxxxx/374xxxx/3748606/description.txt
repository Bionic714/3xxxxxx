Bio:

Launched in 1984, the Transformers« toy line was promoted through
both a Marvel Comics comic book and an animated series. Although
the comic outlived the animated series by a number of years, it
was the animated series that truly captured the hearts and minds
of fans worldwide. In 1986, the series gave birth to a
feature-length animated film, The Transformers«: The Movie, which
featured the voices of Eric Idle, Leonard Nimoy and Orson Welles
among others. The 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION CD of the original
soundtrack from The Transformers«: The Movie features all of the
music from the original soundtrack album plus bonus material
provided by the composer and producer of the filmÆs score, Vince
DiCola.
