All CPS3 roms and a few other fighting game roms as well. If you downloaded the previous torrent and you are stuck at 99.9 that's OKAY. Just go ahead and run the torrent. You are stuck at 99.9 because I accidentally changed one of the config files so it no longer passes the hash check. In any case, the files you downloaded there should all work.
