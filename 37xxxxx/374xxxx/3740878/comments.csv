,betamaxDK,2008-01-15T16:30Z,Thanks a lot. The genre is way more popular now and i don't think it would be any trouble at all to find Bonde Do Role stuff anywhere.
,Pabs324,2008-01-30T00:20Z,i havent been able to find any bonde do role stuff anywhere. any suggestions?
,betamaxDK,2008-01-31T00:31Z,"Hmm, I thought the genre had sorta went mainstream but i suppose not... I recommend searching torrent sites for ""Baile Funk"". There's the M.I.A./Diplo thing http://isohunt.com/download/14673114/Baile+Funk
... and at least 1 bonde do role torrent on piratebay, but it's not much, i get it. If i stumble upon more i'll be sure to upload :-)"

We talk."
,betamaxDK,2008-10-18T13:13Z,"Haha, that's a cool comment Lepow. I guess people would probably appreciate more of this. Hope you're having a good time in Rio, even though you don't have dubstep in your clubs ;-)

Greetings from Denmark."
