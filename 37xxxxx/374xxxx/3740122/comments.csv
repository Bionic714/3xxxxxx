,_Wintermute_,2007-07-15T20:26Z,"Nice torrent, thanks. 

Request: a torrent with only the Tiga Mix of Shake The Disease would be highly appreciated."
,technics2000,2007-07-17T18:37Z,send me your email and i'll send it to you
,pelle9298,2007-07-19T11:13Z,"ItÂ´s hard to suggest som specific songs for the next mix, but everything with PSB, New Order (Electronic, Monaco, Revenge and The Other Two) is always good. To mention some tracks i suggets ""Some Distant Memory"" with Electronic and ""Fugitive"" with PSB.

Otherwise i think the mix of artists and songs you have is perfect so keep going. 

Thank you very much for asking me about some suggestions.
