Against Me! - Thrash Unreal (2007) 

Promo 7-inch

Side A - Thrash Unreal (Record Version)

Side B - You Must Be Willing (Ripped from 7inch)


Im usually just a leech but I figured since I got this promo from AM! I might as well share it because its not likely anyone else will..

The quality isnt the best because my setup here isnt ideal but I would say its satisfactory, after all it's not like you fuckers pay for it... =P

I was planning on scanning the album art and all but my scanner took a shit so sorry about that.. Anyways, hope you guys enjoy my first release (All two of you that will probably download it.) and if I get anything else thats not likely to get into circulation Ill make sure and up it. Sharing is Caring...
