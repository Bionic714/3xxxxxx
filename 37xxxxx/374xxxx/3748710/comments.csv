,acidzebra,2007-07-21T19:43Z,"or maybe there were 6 seeds. Anyway, if you like bad SF movies and dry humor watch this."
,keithdylan,2007-08-03T16:22Z,Anyone else having an issue with some of these not giving a picture just sound on dvd players that also play DIVX files?
,acidzebra,2007-08-04T19:11Z,"No, but then obviously some of the movies use a video codec not supported by your DVD. I've watched them all with xine on a linux box hooked up to the TV and they worked fine.

You'll either have to recode them or watch on your computer."
,keithdylan,2007-08-05T05:53Z,"Ya, I figured that codec situation out.  I figure future machines will play anything AVI.  
"
,keithdylan,2007-08-05T05:54Z,"Also, there is a torrent on demonoid that adds any special missing from this one."
,dTardis,2007-08-22T16:15Z,we need more seeders!
,scorchedurth,2007-09-11T02:12Z,"I was about to jump for joy when I saw this torrent up and running, but the file size exceeds my capacity at current! Will buy new HD and help out with this ASAHP!"
,machspeed5,2007-09-26T07:58Z,"size, rez, bitrate are missing from your fucking description on a 135GB torrent."
,machspeed5,2007-09-26T07:59Z,^ I saw we hang you. upside down. by toenails.
,bradfordx,2007-10-11T07:06Z,what the heck happened..im 35 gigs in (a month)..then im back to 0...something about a crawling eye episode....this one better take cause i cant spend another 3 months on this sweet sweet show......it's almost worth it....SEED U LEECHES!!!!
,thundrrd5,2007-11-06T08:25Z,"I just want to say to acidzebra thank you so much for creating this torrent.  At first I started to download the complete torrent - you did a great job of setting everything up - but after I got about 1.05 gb into the torrent, I stopped it and started to download one show at a time.  Then I can watch them as they finish downloading and I always have one show downloading.  Anyway, I am also seeding for anyone that wants to download.  Thanks again Acidzebra...I've always loved this show and already had about 30 tapes, but this gives me so many that I've never seen.  GREAT!!!"
,bradfordx,2007-11-07T19:30Z,"having serious problems..this is the second time i've tried to download this, and i was 93 gigs in and the error message reads: the file name, the directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect, initialization failed ( allocateFiles: MS3TK Season1\ MS3TK -0101 - 20021112 - The Crawling Eye.avi)....
i can't start it up again...can anyone help me?..i have spent over 3 months strait trying to download this...thanks"
,thundrrd5,2007-11-09T06:26Z,"Hey bradfordx:  I suggest you do what I've been doing.  I download one movie at a time. This way it downloads a movie and creates the file as a .avi file that I can watch while downloading the next movie.  I think it is too hard to try to figure out what is going wrong on your site, but if you do one at a time you don't have to worry about investing a lot of time into the download if you get another error."
,thundrrd5,2007-11-09T06:31Z,"bradfordx:  I noticed you said you can't start it up again.  I would delete everything that has downloaded (including the torrent file) and download the torrent file again.  Then when you go to select which files to download, only select one of the movies and let it download one movie at a time instead of all the movies at once.  As I mentioned, I've been downloading one movie at a time and not having any problems (the only problem was that I didn't have the divx codec and I had to download and install that to watch one of the movies).  Again, don't try to download all the movies at one time...that is nuts."
,thundrrd5,2007-11-09T06:54Z,"Hey bradfordx: I just wanted to point out that you've had this problem before and I'm suspecting that the Crawling Eye file got corrupted on your computer (probably while it was downloading information the first time you had this problem).  As you may - or may not - know, when your torrent software is downloading these files, it will create a file about the size that the file will be when it is completely downloaded.  The file contains a lot of markers that helps your torrent download software to keep track of where it is as it is downloading the file (then if it gets disconnected from the Internet it knows where to start downloading from when reconnected).  Since it has returned an error with the first movie from season one (the crawling eye) I am assuming that this file is corrupted; this is why I have suggested deleting all files (including the original torrent file) and starting again by then downloading a brand new torrent for these downloads. Still, it seems that you should have thought about this yourself, and really, to take a month downloading then get this error and just start again without thinking about what might have caused the problem.  And not think about downloading one movie at a time after that error...I'm sorry, but who really wants to waste all that time?  Just give me a $1000.00 and I'll create the dvd's for you.  Not trying to be mean, but it seems that sometimes people want to get this for free and have everyone figure out the problems for you too."
,bradfordx,2007-11-20T23:45Z,"well...thanks for the help thundrrd...i didn't know you could break it down into parts and download individual portions of it...if i had known that, your right, i would be stupid to try to download the whole thing...however, problems are solved by asking questions, and now that i have asked, there should be no more problem, no?..oh..and you can get the dvd's for 250........but thanks for the offer.."
,rob78901,2007-11-27T11:37Z,@thundrrd5 How did you divde the torrent up into individual episodes again?
,thundrrd5,2007-11-29T06:36Z,"I am using BitComet and if I right click on the Torent file for MST3K it brings up a menu.  I select Display Task List.  Then I click on the General tab.  It gives me a list of all the individual shows with a check box next to them.  I click on the one I want to download and make sure that the rest are unchecked and then start the download.  When it completes, I stop the download and uncheck the one that just finished and then check the next one I want to download...etc...  Hope that helps"
,thundrrd5,2007-11-29T06:37Z,"Sorry, the menu option is Display Task Link..."
,thundrrd5,2007-11-29T07:06Z,"Bradfordx: I was harsh...I appoligize...and you talked me into, I'll tape them for you for 250..."
,aussiedavid,2007-12-28T05:13Z,"I've reached my download limit, but I'm sure looking forward to checking this out! THANK YOU to all those precious seeders - esp fellow Demonoiders!"
,cApNhOwDy123,2008-01-12T19:38Z,"I finally finished downloading this.  Took me a couple of months, but I'm glad that I stuck with it.  I started out on Demonoid, but when those torrents died I was happy to see that there was an active Pirate Bay tracker.  I'll seed this for quite a while, thanks for the up!"
,greasetrap,2008-01-14T07:10Z,"Thanks for keeping this alive.  I plan on having them all someday after I grow up, get a job, and buy massive amounts of external hard drives. "
,Belerik,2008-02-02T09:21Z,MST3K is the absolute best. I will seed this as long as I possibly can after I finish downloading. This torrent can't die!
,audistarr,2008-02-29T21:04Z,"I will seed this all day and night, but i dont have all the episodes. ive seeded 40 gig already,"

,khameleon808,2008-08-15T15:27Z,Has anyone checked the quality of the eps are they good?   How are they compared to the  35 DVD eps?

,cmdrmonkey,2010-01-26T05:12Z,"Really poor video quality, and the audio is out of sync at times. Looks like the source was some old VCR tapes. 

Too bad really, since this was such a great show. "
,pimpampet123,2010-02-13T14:44Z,Quality varies but remember that most of these are VHS sourced and this is the only way to find them (apart from those on the official DVD volumes). They're all at least watchable but most of them are decent quality.
,SOLServo,2010-02-14T16:25Z,"Can't complain about the quality here, that's about as good as you will ever find for most of those episodes.  Strangely omitted from the Specials portion, though, is Poopie! Unless I just missed it.

Seeding this one constantly, 411 GB uploaded so far."
,EvilPeach,2010-04-10T13:32Z,I dont care if this takes two weeks to download. Im on it. Thanks sooo much Zebby
