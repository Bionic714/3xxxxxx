HAPPY DOWNLOADING"
,jellings,2007-07-22T23:19Z,"awesome, i'll seed this for ages once i get it.

do you recon this will run on a macbook (running vista)

(any idea of the system specs of this?)"
,cabron2323,2007-07-23T03:29Z,"Minimum system requirements:
OS: Windows Vista
Processor: 2GHz Pentium 4
RAM: 1GB
Hard Drive: 7GB
Graphics Card: At least nVidia 6000 or ATI x700

macbook should be fine as long as your graphics card is up to it"
,bradfantin,2007-07-25T22:02Z,"i know my imac core duo, scores a 4.5 windows vista system rating, and this game i think needs at least a 3, so mine should work right? "
,cabron2323,2007-07-26T04:12Z,"yeh deffinetly, mine scores a 3.2 and it works fine bro"
,Kurpitsa,2007-07-27T11:51Z,"*Sigh*

After downloading 4 different versions of this game, i still get a wtf-crash-to-desktop about 5 minutes into the game, including this version. Doesn't matter what the hell i do, it always crashes after 5 minutes. 

I have windows vista ultimate (although cracked), i installed the game through the custom install, when it was done i moved the crack from the folder on the .iso into the halo 2 directory and started up the game, followed by a crash after playing for roughly 5 minutes. I doubt that theres any problems with my rig since i can play the game just fine for at least a short amount of time.

So is there something i have missed? A file that i've forgot to transfer or some other simple screw-up?"
,cabron2323,2007-07-27T12:55Z,"the problem is possible caused by something in your system.
go to systemrequirementslab.com to find out if all of your driver are up to date and to ensure you can handle the game.
im 100% sure there is not a problem with this upload, i play it myself and i have heard no other complaints about this.
ill try and help as much as i can though."
,Kurpitsa,2007-07-27T13:00Z,"Thank you for the info cabron, but i've updated all my graphics drivers, i have a nvidia geforce 6800, plenty of ram, hard-drive space etc. so i REALLY doubt that the problem lies in the hardware.

,Ch!l!f00d,2007-07-31T21:15Z,WHERE THE FUCK CAN I GET THE FUCKING CD KEY!!! so i can play online and more then to 4th mission!!!!!!!
,cabron2323,2007-08-02T04:30Z,"no crack or product key in the world would let you play online, except a real one, and mine works fine, i can go past the 4 mission"
,akbarmashti,2007-08-10T22:39Z,"carbon man, 
I'm running this on vista, and in the installation process it asks me to ""Would you like to activate your copy of Halo 2 for windows vista now?"". 
And it also tells me that if i say activate later, then i will play a limited edition or a demo. 
Is there a activation or cd key that you can give me?"
,ivan_213,2007-08-13T05:39Z,"I had the same problem of crashing but this solved my problem:
1.For you people that keep getting a crash open the file with winrar then extract startup (double click)then the iinstallion window should appear and click custom install then install without playin!!! (last option)

2Download magicdisk and mount the winrar archive of halo 2 and the menu should pop out and click play halo. click activate later this will run the demo version until you get a key 
:(

If you got questions Ivan_213@sbcglobal.net"
,jumio,2007-08-20T19:21Z,"Guys, this is a good copy of halo 2 vista. Search online for a product key that works. I found mine and I was able to play.

,Wreckaleck,2007-09-16T17:55Z,u don't have to trust me but u wont be able to play the torrent without it...it's a very trust-worthy torrent
,Maxx0r,2007-09-16T18:24Z,I'm just being cautious...I know people like to false advertise and lead people to trojans and the like.And I don't really have the time for that.But...I'll give it a look anyway.Curiosity just might kill this cat.
,ivan_213,2007-09-19T05:41Z,"DON'T DOWNLOAD WreckalecK kEy Gen

,XJC,2007-09-28T12:32Z,"Wreckaleck is lying.
I downloaded and checked out the keygen he mentioned and it IS a virus.

Do not download it or run it."
,DeMandolorian,2007-10-01T03:08Z,Has anyone got the no CD fix yet?
,kajlin,2007-10-03T10:00Z,"ivan
any keygen will come up as a virus in almost all AV"
,<JesC>,2007-11-16T21:53Z,"Euhm... anyone else got the same problem as me? I mean the game works fine for 5-10 mins, but then it just crashes and says that Halo 2 has faced an error (or summin that way). I have windows vista & I copied the crack file thingy. what am i (or this pc) doing wrong??? sum1 plx helpppp 
T.I.A"
,torashin,2007-11-21T17:58Z,"To all u people with vista. If you don't have any way of finding a product key, there is no point in downloading halo 2. It only lets you play 1 lvl then says u need to register to play any further. That 1 wreckaleck said about doesn't work, but it is not a virus. Any bright ideas? Cos I wana play this game."
,<JesC>,2007-11-23T14:25Z,mmh works fine for me but wont get too far in it.... still the crashing and error messages ... anyone got this working without problems????

,garcsera82,2008-07-14T01:07Z,Is it possible to seed using Limewire? This is the software i am using. Should i be using a different software?
,j4y1981,2008-07-18T21:33Z,heres a easy fix for those people like me who live in the UK go to your nearest shop that sells halo 2. look inside the case and boom theres ya serial ive done it for gears and halo now. Bumb that they leave it in there but hey.

it does work, and the game to."
,albin_pc,2008-12-22T10:57Z,NOOOOOOO FUCKING CD-KEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,uzalu,2010-03-12T16:36Z,"in regards to the virus thing... why dont people understand that there is such a thing as false positive? sure, it might be a virus, but equally its almost MORE LIKELY to just be something that looks like a virus... after all, some legit installers get called viruses alot. dont trust either way 100% !"
,uzalu,2010-03-12T16:38Z,"oh good.. thats on a new page... i better clarify for people looking at this torrent that the virus thing doesnt refer to THIS torrent.

it refers to an offiste crack for it.

this torrent has not been called a virus yet i don't think, just uncracked."
