:. About.:

    Again another older game. just for all race addicted peeps.
    A frantic pulse, intense concentration, the smell of petrol and exhaust,
    assaulting your senses. The lights turn to green and you are thrown back
    into your seats. A rush of adrenaline and full acceleration out of the
    straight and you're into the right-hander. The front of your car lifts as
    you power over the crest and under the Dunlop Bridge.
   
    Hit the brakes hard as you approach the left-right combination, then fire
    it up as you burn into HunaudiSres. Foot to the floor, open it up and let
    it loose. There's six kilometres of tarmac, waiting to be devoured.
    A gentle right-hander is the only rest you get before the track turns wild
    again. Power over the hill and slam on the brakes.
   
    Drop down into a hard right at 90kph. Twist into the 'S' bend at Arnage.
    Now grapple with the steering wheel, the G-force causing your head to be
    thrown from side to side. You burst into the stands. Over 185,000 people.
    Back onto the straight and past the pit lane. Lap time 3:49:221. 
    The crowd explodes into a frenzy of cheers and applause.
