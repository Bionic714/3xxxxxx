,Tydues,2007-07-21T12:10Z,Thank you for seeding this one :)
,lostfanatic815,2007-07-21T12:20Z,"Thank you! I bought my book at midnight, and I'm at chapter 14 now... But I'm off driving for a couple of hours, and it will be great having the book then too! Thanks!"
,c.kotecky,2007-07-21T12:24Z,"Thanks so much for uploading so early!!!!! And don't worry, I will buy all seven together when they're available."
,Gunmann,2007-07-21T12:40Z,Please upload then one with Stephen Fry as well!
,Damirus,2007-07-21T12:57Z,Thank you for this! been waiting for it for a long time! :D
,Pumpkin Escobar,2007-07-21T13:02Z,"If you are going to limit your U/L to 40 kbps (Why?), how about super seeding so that we can at least get the first files first and begin listening before the entire file is complete?  Otherwise, many of us will jump to faster torrents when they become available.

Thanks for and consideration.
"
,Larsone,2007-07-21T13:13Z,"Yes please super-seed at least for an hour our so, then some of us can SS and you can take yours back down to 40. I don't mind when I get the whole thing opening mine up to max, that'll be about 2MBs but I need to get it first to be able to do that..."
,mannpowerdk,2007-07-21T13:14Z,"Greatings from Denmark
Tanks man :)
Keep seeding please!"
,jellings,2007-07-21T13:24Z,"Awesome, i'll keep this seeding for ages once i get it.

Does anyone know when the stephen fry version will be out on the internet?"
,sterling47,2007-07-21T13:28Z,"I am not seeing any seeds... I leave my system running at all times, seeing from my machine is assured for quite some time."
,White-Rabbit,2007-07-21T13:29Z,"I see loads of ppl stuck at 10,7% and downloading 0kb/s. Nice seeding."
,jellings,2007-07-21T13:31Z,"gnbtnt:

if you're using a torrent client that supports giving priority to certain files within the torrent, would there be any chance of giving the first disc high priority? that way we'd all be able to listen to the first disc while we wait for the rest. would be awesome."
,jellings,2007-07-21T13:37Z,"White-Rabbit:

This torrent's only been up for 50minutes, and he's already said he can only seed at 40kb/s & the file is 891MB. I'm terrible at maths but i recon it'd take about 6 hours before anyone gets to 100%.

But as soon as people get to 100% and are seeding everyone else's download speed will go up dramatically."
,Tara,2007-07-21T13:40Z,"It would be really great if I could at least the first couple of cds before I go to work in an hour. 

I am seeding and seeding (1,2 MB/s) but there doesen't seem to be anyone with the whole file seeding? And, as someone mentioned before, you get cd10 before you get cd1 so you can't start listening.

I don't want to seem ungrateful - so thank you very much for sharing this!!!"
,sterling47,2007-07-21T13:50Z,"Jellings: Thank you for refreshing my memory on the 40k seed speed and reality. I guess I am just being flat out too impatient.

gnbtnt: Thank you so very much for getting this seeded for us. For the record, I did buy the book tonight in the big event. "
,Pumpkin Escobar,2007-07-21T14:15Z,"Since super-seeding seems to be out of the question, you might try using a High Priority setting   for the track you want first.  That may help you to receive the CD 01 in a timely fashion before CD 10."
,jellings,2007-07-21T14:23Z,"Putting CD1 on high priority would only really work if you were downloading from someone who had downloaded CD1 100%.

Although if enough people have CD1 on high priority it probably will make a difference. 
(I've downloaded CD1 to 36% while all the other CDs i've downloaded to 10-20%)
So i guess it's definitely worth trying"
,Pumpkin Escobar,2007-07-21T14:32Z,"Correct, but at the same time, emphasis is placed on that file so it should D/L first upon availability.
"
,goodguydoll84,2007-07-21T14:33Z,I already bought 2 copies of the book i just don't want to wait for the mail.
,b_42,2007-07-21T15:33Z,"big thanks for this!! btw is the Stephen Fry's version out yet? i've heard, that it's way better than the Jim Dale's"
,jackie6,2007-07-21T15:36Z,"Well...Nice to see so many well behaving people..
Haven´t anyono of you understand how seed works?!
Let it bee, just wait, it´ll come!
gnbtnt: I think you did it great!"
,DragonSlayerâ?¢,2007-07-21T15:40Z,"So ...
A real awaitet treasure, for us ""Potter-fans"",
but with no seeder at 100% there will be a lot more waiting I guess.
Would be VERY nice if anyone who has the complete torrent to seed for a day or two ...
Please seed."
,wizeguy1,2007-07-21T15:46Z,im downloading this but i cant find a seeder. im at 13.5% and the highest right now is 30.2% completed. i just hope you guys finish before i do so it will speed up so we can keep seeding is like crazy. im also finding 50(2500)+ peers so this should speed up soon. 
,Sigun,2007-07-21T16:01Z,"Nice.. 2750 peers and rising :) , CD 1 almost finished dowloading just a few more bits left"
,wizeguy1,2007-07-21T16:04Z,you have the first cd? im stuck at 84.5% for cd1
,milken84,2007-07-21T16:19Z,Är detta den vuxna versionen / Is this the adualt version?
,Pumpkin Escobar,2007-07-21T16:22Z,"As far as I know the only difference between the versions is the cover.  Now, there may be some differences between the U.K. version and the U.S. version."
,MrMojo1,2007-07-21T16:25Z,"Someone has posted a torrent for the Stephen Fry version at isohunt. Don't know if it's authentic or not! Download at your own risk!

I appreciate those that made this HP audiobook available for the rest of us, regardless of the narrator!

As the poster stated, ""if you enjoy it, please buy it!""

For those that have downloaded the audiobook, please SEED!

Thank you for the post!"
,mad0nnarob,2007-07-21T16:28Z,Hi! It seems we have to seeders now! Where are the other people? Please seed!
,Pumpkin Escobar,2007-07-21T16:37Z,"Keep your pants on.  The file has not completed, thus only one seeder so far."
,Nirvane,2007-07-21T16:40Z,"Thanks for this torrent :D

CD1 just finished for me so everyone should be able to get it quicker now.

Now disc 2 :D"
,James_013,2007-07-21T16:44Z,"Such a great torrent :D

CD1 Has jus completed for me aswell

Thanks Again :)"
,jellings,2007-07-21T16:45Z,"""Seeders 2, Downloaded 0 times""
I don't get that but utorrent says that there's only 1 seed.

& awesome disc 1 has fully downloaded, so i have something to listen to until the rest are finished =]"
,jellings,2007-07-21T16:47Z,BTW i think the reason it says there are 4 seeders is because some people set their torrent software to only download CD1 - so once it had finished the software repoted them as seeders even though they had not completed the entire audiobook.
,marreroj,2007-07-21T16:49Z,is this jim dales version?
,billsaw,2007-07-21T16:50Z,"jackie6:
i do undedstand how to seed new stuff but it is not clear to me how to add a ADDTTIONAL seeding to a exsitinng torrent.
I use BitComet could someone elaborate?? their help does not make this clear at all"
,daniel9,2007-07-21T16:55Z,"here is the version by fry. this isnt verified yet but perhaps someone can check and post it up unrared

http://isohunt.com/release/98888/potter"
,goodguydoll84,2007-07-21T17:07Z,The reason the seeders are going up is because were sharing faster than we're downloading mine is currently 352mb down/ 430mb up
,Pirateatheart,2007-07-21T17:15Z,"Utorrent as of 7/21
11:14 am est does not show any active seeds and most people are stuck at 40% or so.

but i have the 1st few cd's and its the real deal!"
,jellings,2007-07-21T17:17Z,"I don't think the Stephen Fry version on isohunt is real, utorrent says that there are no seeds on it and all the peers i connected to are at 0%."
,jackie6,2007-07-21T17:34Z,"Seed works that way that when you upload a torrent you are the only on who have 100%, when there is many people who download at the same time (as in this case) you all have to share that ONE 100%!!!! It´ll take time!!! Then, when we are more who got 100% it will be faster, DO NOT COMPLAIN, you can bye it in the store!!!"
,lostfanatic815,2007-07-21T17:37Z,"According to my calculations: 6.5 hours to go until we have all downloaded it all. Phew. A lot of hours. But no worries. We still owe gnbtnt a lot for uploading this.

Oh, and when it comes to which version is best, Jim Dale's or Stephen Fry's... I think they're equally good. I'm more used to listening to Jim Dale's versions, though, and I feel comfortable with his voice and I recognize all his character voices... So, I'm happy that this is ""his"" version."
,tonez123,2007-07-21T17:37Z,"when is stephen fry one is going to come out, i hate jim dale, he sounds like a retart. probably its his accent."
,jellings,2007-07-21T17:51Z,"I don't usually listen to Jim Dale's versions of the audiobooks, but listening to chapter 1 of this it sounds alright.
I do prefer Fry's though so i'll probably switch to that when it comes out on the internet."
,lpr,2007-07-21T18:17Z,Tanks Disk 1 works fine.
,Alexbungle,2007-07-21T18:20Z,"are you all stuck at 51,3 %"
,Tai_Kyoku,2007-07-21T18:22Z,"51.4% here :P But i have disc 1...and 75% on disc 2, i'm trying to get disc2 before i start listening..."
,gumamela,2007-07-21T18:27Z,i think the fry version at isohunt is real. i somehow know that guy jay2. hes a co-member in a p2p site. and in that site it is not likely to release things that arent good . he's just offline right now thats why there's no seeder...
,mannpowerdk,2007-07-21T18:40Z,"any one have a scan of the audiobook cover and index???
Keep seeding :)"

,puffsnurran,2007-07-21T18:51Z,"Kan någon översätta för mej?

Varför posta en torrent som många vill ha om man själv inte vill dela med sej maximalt?

Själv kommer jag att dela med mej drygt ett dygn efter att jag fått hala audioboken (och jag ska höpa boken i två upplagor=på engelska och svenska) pluss audioboken."
,marreroj,2007-07-21T19:06Z,i dont think i have listened to frys only jim dales and his are very good.
,lostfanatic815,2007-07-21T19:10Z,"puffsnurran: Du får nog vänligt vänta till den svenska versionen kommer om du vill ha den översatt ;) Och jag tror den ska släppas i november eller nåt.

Det kan ju vara så att gnbtnts uppladdningshastighet inte är snabbare än 40 kb/s (=0,4 MBit), och att han/hon inte KAN seeda snabbare än så. Det rinner ju på, men i ganska långsam hastighet. Men om runt midnatt bör vi vara många som seedar, och då ska det säkert gå undan ska du se."
,puffsnurran,2007-07-21T19:17Z,"Det var inte boken jag ville ha översatt.

TRANSLATION of what PUFFSNURRAN wrote in Swedish (at his request):

""Can someone translate for me?

Why post a torrent that many people want if you don't feel like sharing as much as possible?

I, myself, will share over 24 hours after I have downloaded the entire audio book (and I will buy two editions of the book = in English and in Swedish plus the audio book)."""
,Pirateatheart,2007-07-21T19:40Z,"well again its been a while, im at 64% and still no seeders im going to seed for a good long while after d/l so if you would be so kind to seed so that others can do it too.  yay for saving 80$"

,puffsnurran,2007-07-21T20:00Z,"Thanks Lost....vad fan du nu hette.

Just about the point of what I wrote (but In Svengelska)"
,Pumpkin Escobar,2007-07-21T20:03Z,"gnbtnt - Any chance of super seeding?  Also, why the 1MB files if you are capping your U/L at only 40 kbps?  Smaller might have been quicker."
,gnbtnt,2007-07-21T20:06Z,"Pumpkin Escobar:
Well, my connection is 500 kb/s down and only 40 kb/s up, so it is physically impossible to upload more than I am. 

And I let uTorrent pick the piece size automatically, please excuse this lack of efficiency. "
,Pumpkin Escobar,2007-07-21T20:09Z,"gnbtnt - Thanks for the response.  BTW, uTorrent does allow for the use of Super Seeding."

got Disk 1&2 now next disk 3 
Thanks again"
,Pumpkin Escobar,2007-07-21T20:18Z,"gnbtnt - Simple:

1.  Double click on the file in the uTorrent file window and a new window will open.

2.  At the bottom left corner, click the 'Initial Seeding' box, then click 'OK.'

This should dramatically increase the efficiency of you upload, and make a lot of people happy.

Thanks again for you time and trouble.

,Pumpkin Escobar,2007-07-21T20:23Z,"It should as it will make the distribution quicker as you only have to send each file out once, instead of to multiple peers.  What might happen, though, is that folks might not receive the files in chronological order.  Still quicker, though."
,RobiiNDownloadeR,2007-07-21T20:25Z,suddenly the speed began to rise. At 200 kbit now!!

,Pumpkin Escobar,2007-07-21T20:58Z,"If you had seeded each file once already, that would be true, but you were seeding inefficiently before.  Hopefully we've remedied that."
,gnbtnt,2007-07-21T20:58Z,"good idea, hairypotter7, when you finish then there will be two sources that you can get this from, everyone. 
"
,gnbtnt,2007-07-21T21:00Z,"Uzd4ce:

they are mp3's and .cue's

,lostfanatic815,2007-07-21T21:24Z,"96 kBit/s is totally okay. I don't know if it's mono or stereo, but 96 kBit mono (why need stereo when it's mainly spoken anyway?) equals the quality of 192 kBit stereo. And once again - it's spoken word we're talking about, not music."
,jellings,2007-07-21T21:26Z,"96kits is actually really high for an audiobook. it doesn't need to be that high since it's just a guy talking and doesn't need to have as much depth as a song (which would have vocals & many instruments etc.)

,jellings,2007-07-21T21:52Z,"Why would you need stereo in an audiobook?

The narrator would have been reading into a single microphone in the original recording so the original recording would most likely have been mono.

Also if the audiobook is encoded in mono the bitrate can be higher (as there only needs to be information for one audio stream) so you can get twice the quality in the same filesize.

With music stereo is important as some instruments or parts of the vocals were originally meant to be heard from different speakers. But with audiobooks this is not needed.

As someone said earlier 96kbits mono is equal to 192kbits stereo.

It's not that it's been made into mono because someone doesn't want it such a big size - simply that 96kbits mono is the highest quality an audiobook needs to be. If you haven't already download a part of this audiobook and see for yourself - it sounds very good. The only way you'd be able to notice a ""lack of quality"" compared to the original audiobook would be if you were to play it through big speakers, but who listens to an audiobook through big speakers anyway?

thank you so much for this upload, what i've heard so far is awesome! remember to use Initial Seeding next time though as that really helps when uploading =]"
,gnbtnt,2007-07-21T21:55Z,"will do.

thanks everyone for your support and dedication."
,living420,2007-07-21T21:57Z,"if you like 64kbps audiobooks than you mean you like two 32kbps mono tracks. I'm saying get rid of one of the tracks and cut the filesize in half or double the audio quality in the same amount of space.

jellings gets it."
,Pumpkin Escobar,2007-07-21T22:02Z,I get it as I've listened to many different audiobooks and I prefer 96k in Stereo.  I can tell the difference.

You've done a good job."
,gnbtnt,2007-07-28T08:13Z,"_Calle__92:

The .cue's tell your computer where the individual tracks are inside the cd rips. They are useful of you want to re-burn them to cd's and don't want just an hour or more of audio without breaks so you don't know where you are. You need a program that can integrate them into the burning process, however. If you have a PC, just right click on one of the .cue's and select ""Open With"" and select ""Notepad"", it should show you what I mean. "

,gnbtnt,2007-08-01T07:27Z,"@Hutlernn 
Honestly I did not want to go through the trouble and compress them all...I like my torrents simply and clean, and there are still people out there who can't handle the ""difficult"" nature of .rar's.

Also, if someone wants just one cd of this, to perhaps try it out or whatnot, they can not download just one cd if it is in a divided .rar file. 

And the .cue's help the person who wants to burn them to cd's have a complete CD experience and not one hour and seventeen minute long track. 

Any more questions/comments Hutlernn?

,gnbtnt,2007-08-03T19:37Z,"@rodan_424
yeah. its the real book; but it is the American version so it is a bit different (most likely) from the British one. "
,Sanicle,2007-08-06T21:54Z,"Also, in the lead up to the book's release there were MANY torrents claiming to be it, although the vast majority were fan fictions, albeit long and well written in some cases. If the plot is entirely different it is likely you have been taken in by one of the fan fictions. If it's just words here and there that are different, this is common amongst audio book adaptations, and as has been stated the American version has minor differences."
