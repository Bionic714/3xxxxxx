,kemenyadi,2008-11-05T16:06Z,hi! are these music videos or live performances? thanks :)
,DooMDrat,2008-12-03T15:52Z,"Uhh, stupid question, but how do I go about burning these off? I downloaded a separate torrent of the first disc that was a standard size ISO. Why is this version ~50% larger?"
,Cheech469,2008-12-05T21:39Z,I am curious too about that. 6GB is way over the 4.7GB limit of DVDs. There must be some reasonable solution. :)
,Cheech469,2008-12-09T20:39Z,Anyone interested you can burn them on Dual layer DVDs. Now to change these to NTSC.
