,brad102,2007-07-23T04:09Z,"I downloaded and installed it, but when I try to use it with 3dsMax a box pops up and it tell me to register my product. So could you please crack it or send me the instructions to register it?"
,brad102,2007-07-23T04:15Z,"Ok I started looking everywhere in the file, and I finally found how to crack it, it wasnt obvious you should probably make a readme file. Anyways.. So far everything is working great, thanks for uploading this awesome plugin!!! :D and sry for the other comment on accusing you of not having included a crack "
,tpg-chaos,2007-07-23T07:22Z,"FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE UNSURE:

""FumeFX10_ACAP8.EXE"" is for max 7 & 8
""FumeFX10_R9_32.EXE"" is for max 9 - 32 bit
""FumeFX10_R9_64.EXE"" is for max 9 - 64 bit

and the 3 provided .zip files are all cracks, one for each of these versions - they are all named accordingly so have a look towards the end of the filename where it will say whether it is the 3dsmax 7&8, 3dsmax 9(32 bit), or 3dsmax  9(64 bit) crack :)"
,nash,2007-08-23T18:02Z,"Simply cant get it to work... Installing, copying dcpflics.dlu to ...3dsMax8\plugins\Afterworks\Common and copying TSregisternow.dll to the max8 root. All i get is a registration prompt or a ""failed to load plugins"" either way sucks...

Im probably doin some obvious dumbass mistake... So anyone got a clue?"
,nash,2007-08-23T18:54Z,"Sometimes i find that demon i catched as a young man quite amusing. 
Two minutes after my recent post, it was fixed... Dont bloody ask me how, i did the same damn procedure as last time(James)... and Plopp... Tada!!"
,paradice_UK,2007-10-29T01:50Z,"For max 8 crack
If you open/extract the file
Sitni.Sati.FumeFX.v1.0.for.3DS.Max.7.and.8-BB3D.zip

Then double clik the extracted folder 
Sitni.Sati.FumeFX.v1.0.for.3DS.Max.7.and.8-BB3D

Double clik  bb3d.nfo
You get the following info at bottom of page...

-------------------------------------------------

Install/Crack Notes:


1. extract
2. install
3. Place DCPFLICS.dlu in ...\Autodesk\3dsMax8\plugins\Afterworks\Common 
4. Place TSRegisterNow.dll in ...\Autodesk\3dsMax8

Step 4 is only needed if you skip installation
of DCPFLICS from the plugin installer.
NOTE: DCPFLICS crack is also working for other DCPFLICS protected plugins
