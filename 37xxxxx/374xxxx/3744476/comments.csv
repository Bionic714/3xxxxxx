However, I think you did something wrong when ripping, since the audio didn't come along, and there's no AUDIO_TS folder in the DVD image root. Also, the video seems to be playing with some little gaps, I don't know if they were caused by my own computer or the image itself.

So, do this one more favor to the community and check the audio thing. This is the first serious copy of Speed Lives and I'm seriously grateful by it."

,funkygek29,2008-05-26T23:57Z,"Nothing is free.  As you study these incredible guitar lessons you'll understand the price that you paid for stealing this material.  While you're gaining incredible insight on how to master the guitar, your subconscious will gain insight into your lack of personal integrity, and dishonesty. Every time you practice these exercises you'll dwell on the fact that you stole this program.  

Can you imagine? Even twenty years from now as you pick up the guitar to work on these techniques, both your subconscious and conscious minds will be dwelling on your dishonesty and lack of integrity.  You helped destroy the business that created these lessons.  Truth is, you'll lose interest in playing guitar for this reason.  You'll see.

I'm one of Michael Angelo Batio's students (Michael is the creator of Speed Lives).  You're stealing directly from him, the instructor.  He creates these lessons and sells them to his students directly.  This is how he makes a living.  You're not stealing from some huge corporation.  You're stealing from a guy making an honest living putting together lessons that have helped thousands of guitarists reach their potential.  

These DVDs sell for $19.95 each.  That's a small price to pay to not feel like a thief for the rest of your life.  Trust me on that one. Plus, for $19.95 you get a high quality DVD not these blurry, compressed video files.  You get a manual so you can actually learn this stuff.  You get chapters to easily navigate the program.  You get a goal list, a chapter list, and animated tab to play along with these exercises.  And you get to not feel like a lowlife scumbag for the rest of your life.  Maybe that's why most people are honest ? it feels good.  It feels like you're doing the right thing.  Wouldn't you like to feel good about yourself?  http://www.metalmethod.com/lead-guitar-lesson-speed-kills.htm"
