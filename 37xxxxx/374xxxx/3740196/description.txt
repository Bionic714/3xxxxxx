release info

Welcome to The Freak Showa fresh addition to the ever growing family of BNE\\\'s artists.

Meet freak no.1 - Itay Avraham (25) and freak no.2 - Itay Dangur (28). The Freak Show are based at a secret studio in Holon, Israel, 500 meters from BNE\\\'s headquarters.

The freaks have been eating, sleeping & breathing music throughout their entire life, deriving most of their early inspiration from R & B and Hip Hop, and recent years from electro & trance, all triumphally celabrated in their upcoming tunes.

The Freak Show can best be described as a dynamic & powerfull Psytrance outfit, bringing a whole new range of of madness to the masses. As you can hear in their music, their goal is one- to rock the dance floors!

Working within the comfort of their own studio in the past two years gave rise to amazing, top notch produced music, filled with monstrous bass lines & massive drum sets that scored them a sure winner!

Some of their music has already seen light on various compilations in the past year, as can be heard on their wild & energetic live show, peformed in Israeli and abroad, and receiving raving compliments from the crowd, on the internet & by all promoters involved, that The Freak Show did excactly that- freaked everyone out!

With additional shows scheduled for the upcoming spring & summer, and now backed with this intense dance floor album, you can rest assure that The Freak Show is an act to watch out for in 2007.

Let the FREAKS come out
