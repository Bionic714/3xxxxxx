Deep Purple: Ian Gillan, David Coverdale (vocals); Ritchie Blackmore (guitar); Jon Lord (keyboards); Roger Glover, Glenn Hughes (bass); Ian Paice (drums).

Whereas the 1978 Deep Purple best-of collection, WHEN WE ROCK, WE ROCK & WHEN WE ROLL, WE ROLL, leaves out a few fan favorites, DEEPEST PURPLE: THE VERY BEST OF DEEP PURPLE (released two years later) includes nearly all of the missing gems. By not containing any selections recorded with the band's original '60s lineup with vocalist Rod Evans ("Hush," "Kentucky Woman," etc.), and focusing only on the Ian Gillan and David Coverdale eras, Purple's heaviest compositions are spotlighted.

Throughout DEEPEST PURPLE, guitarist Ritchie Blackmore shows why many six-string enthusiasts consider him to be one of the kings of classic riffs, especially with his work on Purple's two biggest hits, "Smoke on the Water," and "Black Night." Although the ferocious "Speed King" was from the early '70s, it easily holds its own against '80s/'90s thrash and speed metal. The extended compositions "Strange Kind of Woman," "Highway Star," "Child in Time," and "Woman from Tokyo" include improvised sections. Also featured are the more succinct "Burn," "Stormbringer," and "Fireball," plus the heavy metal road anthem "Space Truckin'." At over an hour in length, DEEPEST PURPLE: THE VERY BEST OF DEEP PURPLE is the best single disc collection of Deep Purple hits you can find.
