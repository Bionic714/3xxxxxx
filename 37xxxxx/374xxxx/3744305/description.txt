Our Hospitality (1923)

Directed by Buster Keaton & Jack Blystone

Starring Buster Keaton, Natalie Talmadge

From Leonard Maltin Movie Guide:

Buster goes to the South to claim a family inheritance, and falls in love with the daughter of a longtime rival clan. Sublime silent comedy, one of Buster's best, with a genuinely hair-raising finale. Incidentally, Buster married his leading lady in real life.

Maltin includes it in his 100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century List, along with Keaton's 'The General' (1927).

Notes from Wikipedia:

Keaton set the film in the 1830s so he could indulge his passion for trains by creating a working model of Stephenson's Rocket, the first locomotive.

The Canfield-McKay feud is an obvious satire of the real-life Hatfield-McCoy feud.
