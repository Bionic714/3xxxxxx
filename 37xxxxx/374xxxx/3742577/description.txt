The complete collection of South Park episodes as of now (summer 2007).

All files in this torrent where originally downloaded from the South Park-exclusive tracker atwhich is a really great source for everything South Park. If you're looking to download just one or a few episodes, you're probably better off going there. This is intended for those of you who want to get hold of all or most of the episodes at once.

Here's some info about the files included.

Includes all episodes from season 1-10 and the first half of season 11 (the second half hasn't been aired yet as this is being posted).

All episodes are encoded with high quality DivX video and MP3 audio. All episodes from seasons 1 through 8 are ripped from official DVDs, as well as some season 9 episodes. The rest of the episodes are very high quality TV-rips.

Resolution varies between 464 x 352 pixels to 576 x 432 pixels. Most of the early episodes have lower resolutions, while most of the more recent ones have higher.

I will seed this as much as possible until I have a share ratio of at least 5.0, but I'll probably keep seeding more even after that, still as always, help seeding as much as you can when you're done downloading and everyone will benefit. You all know the routine.
