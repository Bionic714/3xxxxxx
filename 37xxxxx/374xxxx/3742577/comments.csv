,FotherMucker,2007-09-27T09:29Z,"kanin1337, you fucking MORON!

You've got 1337 in ur name yet u know jack shit about d/l'ing torrents. Every wimp with the least bit of knowledge about it out there knows that you can set priority to seperate files, do that and they'll download first so u can watch em while the other prioritised ones can proceed to download. Now don't forget it u nub! >_<

Oh and: wmp will do just fine but vlc will do better :)"
