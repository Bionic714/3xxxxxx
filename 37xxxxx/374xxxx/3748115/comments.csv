i loved the books(22 years ago),and the movie was ok.
but a tv  show would bring out the depth and
give a larger insight(as the books did).

thanx a lot Shirotora."

,shirotora,2007-07-27T01:59Z,"Only a pilot episode. The movie was supposed to be a series, and when that flopped, they decided to try to make a TV series, which also flopped. Most people do not understand the humor especially from  Chiun, in the middle of all the action and violence."
