,gamehammer,2007-08-23T20:33Z,"I have a emu and a japanese bios. I am able to run the iso.bin if i have it mounted. When i do run it i am stuck in this level. it is sort of a sonic purgatory.  He can only catch about 50 coins or so and he can only run on a rectangular patch of green  hills, a river. The boarders are very restrictive. One would assume there is more to this sonic xtreme download. Is there?  "
