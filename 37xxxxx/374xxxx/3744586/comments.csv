,nalex133,2007-07-18T01:34Z,"Sorry, unreliable connection. Hope you all got what you need."
,nalex133,2007-07-18T01:37Z,"Why is it, the people, who mown the most never upload anything."
,g_ij_s,2007-07-18T18:47Z,Does not work again. Still waiting for someone to get a correct working version voor de x64 version. 
,shinjukublack,2007-07-19T22:02Z,Does it work for Vista x64 or not?
,nalex133,2007-07-22T21:03Z,"Yes it dose, rad the crack before you do anything. Make the directory first than install. If you are using a 64bit processor with Vista (32 or 64 versions) it will work sorry I can't hold your hand any more. Now go make then drive faster and nice looking."
,g_ij_s,2007-07-25T10:37Z,"Sorry your claim that it works with x64 is just plain wrong. The crack will replace some dll files. If it goes right diskeeper crashes, if it goes wrong the program is still not activated.

The DLL files are for the x32 version of Windows Vista.

So AGAIN: I'm waiting for someone with a crack for the x64 version. THIS IS NOT A x64 CRACK!!!

I could however push the activationdate back by another 30 days."

The activation process involves, in part, Diskeeper identifying your PC as unique. To do this it uses various combinations of your computers hardware. They are (in part); your motherboard, your hard drive, and your BIOS. It is possible (though very rare), where that data is insufficient to uniquely ID the computer, that other hardware must be considered. What is used, and in what combination, varies from computer to computer. As stated in the FAQs, no software data or personal data (to identify you) is ever collected form your PC(s). Apart from the obvious and valid privacy considerations, there simply is no technically legitimate reason to do this as it doesn't make ""activation"" any more secure or reliable. For anyone interested, the FAQ pages provide more data on the entire process. 

So, if you change out the hard drive (where your operating system drive is located) you will very likely need to re-activate. If you change the BIOS or the motherboard, you may also have to re-activate. It depends on the number of metrics used and if the hardware replacement is determined to constitute enough of a change that the computer ID needs to be re-figured. This is, again, very similar to Window's design."
