But a great copy. It's the closest you can get to the real book at this moment."
,eskhyo,2007-07-20T15:19Z,This is the real deal. First perfect eBOOK-copy I've seen.
,KunaL6,2007-07-20T16:06Z,"Bestobal > This is the real, Aftonbladet says that the last word is ""scar"", but Rowling herself inidcates that it is not. 

""During a July 2007 interview broadcast on the BBC One's Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, Rowling announced that ""scar"" was no longer the last word in the book. Although long reported and confirmed by Rowling to be the final word of book 7, Rowling went on record as saying that ""Scar is quite near the end, but it's not the last word."" She refused to say what the last word was.[55]""

God, I love the Internet. I'd have sex with it if it let me. Thanks much for the upload, Mackez! You, sir/madam, are a master."
,Bakvis,2007-07-20T16:49Z,"Yeah, it's real. Identical to the photo version.

SPOILER! SPOILER!

The last line is:
""The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well."""
,Orph85,2007-07-20T16:56Z,"That was unnecessary... Please give a little better warning next time, cause that was a big time spoiler."

No offence mate but when reading the comments on a torrent of an illegal copy of a book that hasn't been released yet you aren't really in any position to bitch about spoilers"
