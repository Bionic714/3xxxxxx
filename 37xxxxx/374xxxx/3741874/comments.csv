,4X-AXG,2007-07-15T00:15Z,"haha nah a request once in a while is no problem at all..some guys just really push it, those are the ones that piss me off..if you have a specific request, do not hesitate to ask it once or twice..I do not promise anything (I hate uploading old stuff or stuff that has already been shared) but maybe you will get lucky :)"

Queen Charlotte Islands - Sandspit Airport?

Would be a nice refueling stop on the way to Alaska ;)"
