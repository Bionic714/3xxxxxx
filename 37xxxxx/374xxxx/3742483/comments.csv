,dainvada,2007-07-15T17:10Z,"ok as i said before first time doing this so leave me the F alone, cause im happy keeping the videos to myself"
,FreddeKruger,2007-07-16T01:43Z,"It's working, seeding :) Great thanks! How about the other 2?"
,Quasimiyao,2007-07-20T03:20Z,"Awesome! Thanks alot:) Love this show. 
Will help seed:)"
,Quasimiyao,2007-07-20T12:26Z,"It seems like a lot of us are stuck at 71,7%. You still seeding this one?"
,styx32,2007-07-21T02:43Z,hmm been stuck for a week now will someone seed this plz!
,obeah13,2007-07-21T05:11Z,have never seen anybody seed this...still Im up 70%???
,Quasimiyao,2007-07-21T12:32Z,"Well, I got a few of the episodes of another site, and I replaced the ones in this torrent with those so all episodes, except nr 1 and 3, so you should be able to complete those."
,Tchanchet,2007-07-28T15:31Z,"Stuck at 95.2% too.
At least I'm seeding for some folks ...

I'm very disappointed because I'm a big Ramsay fan and we can't see the BBC channels here. Kitchen Nightmares are supposed to be shown this year's fall (A US version) and I wanted to have an impression on the original serie first."
,dealerovska,2007-08-09T19:17Z,"fcuk! the best episode is uncomplete, the uploader must  have a huge asshole!"
,starfish5,2007-08-13T21:17Z,"Please Dainvada, would you consider  to seed just to get us completed?"
,Tchanchet,2007-08-14T15:56Z,"Yeah, please seed for a little while.
I'm stuck at 98.3 % 
Thanks in advance"
,rafaelparaujo,2007-08-14T23:25Z,Can someone seed please?? stuck at 98.3% also for about 4 days thanks
,MazeMan74,2007-08-16T01:10Z,"As the rest im stuck at 98.3% and im not very happy about it. Why dont you just seed it and get some of us completed and the problem will be off your back. Please, pretty please with sugar on top..."
,boxingchief,2007-08-29T14:19Z,No seeding???? This FUCKIN SUCKS!!!
,dainvada,2007-08-30T05:51Z,Hey sorry bout the long time no seeding i am working on seeding them just give me a day or two to redo the torrent.
,Gubscal,2007-09-08T11:47Z,"98,3 % :("
,knattus,2008-02-21T22:54Z,"Something worth to note:
It is: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409608/ (UK 2005)
Not the real American version (Which is about 100 times better and only have 1 season). But hey, it's still Gordon!"
,muumoo,2008-03-28T01:02Z,Thank you!
[T],paulyearwig,2008-10-30T06:58Z,"""the real american version""?

this is the original version, the american show is a remake you dumb yankee.

no wonder everyone hates you"
,TMA2,2009-03-19T07:25Z,"knattus, the american version is a bunch of overdramatized, over-produced horseshit. the original BBC series is way more interesting."
,spamslayer,2010-01-16T18:36Z,The BBC version shows a much more realistic version of Gordon Ramsey.  The USA version shown on FOX is overedited to look like all he does is yell at people.  Just a dumb Yankee's opinion.  Sorry you hate us.
,varilthes,2010-07-27T14:34Z,!Do Not Download! This is not a proper season 2- Episodes 1-4 is correct but the Revisited episodes are just copy and pasted original episodes not the actual Revisited Episode.
,darthtard,2010-09-23T06:46Z,"The ""Revisited"" episodes are definitely not copy/pastes.  If you care to check the content you can see very slight differences.  Though, it seems most of the content is the same.  I haven't seen the legit copies of this season so I don't know what's up.  I speculate that the producers got lazy and just filled in these revisited episodes with most of the original content.  If anyone has actually seen the legit eps I'd love if you can comment on whether this assumption is correct.  I compared the first two revisited episodes and here are my notes:

--Compared 11:30 same as 11:07; Intros are slighty different: ""...but the glass house is in deep trouble (00:17)""""...but when I first visited the glass house it was in deep trouble (00:16) --

S01E02 - the glass house - 48:06
S02E05 - the glass house revisited - 49:28

--Compared 32:30 same as 33:40; Intros are slighty different: ""The walnut tree inn is in trouble (00:00) ""When I first arrived, the walnut tree was in trouble (00:00)--

S01E03 - walnut tree - 47:59
S02E06 - walnut tree inn revisited - 48:54"
