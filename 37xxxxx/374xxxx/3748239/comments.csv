,CoolDude3000,2007-08-25T14:44Z,"Ok so what kind of system do I need for this one? I'de like to use it on my 1.8ghz single core 64bit Turion AMD laptop with 128mb ATI mobility radeon x700 and 1gb of ram... Anychance it'll work correctly?

I could use my duel core 2.93ghz amd with 512mb x1950 ati and 2GB OCZ 2800MB/s ram but thats water cooled, weighs a tonne and not easy to drag around with my projector... :p

So any chance my laptop can play this? its a Ferrari if that helps :p he he"

I tried VLC and mplayer, but neither one will play it.
MacOSX, by the while.

Thanks,
