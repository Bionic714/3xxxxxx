,sergeant-waffels,2007-07-23T21:44Z,"thnx, works great, but what is the other application that needs a key rather than the converter"
,Takster,2007-07-24T07:16Z,"@sergeant-waffels

The Pro Codec
The plug-ins

You have to register these products also remember, not just the converter (which uses the Pro Codec)"

,marcusgc3,2008-09-09T07:17Z,"thanks Takster! Does anyone know where I can find serials/keygen to get my ""DivX Author"" registered?"
,issokay,2008-11-14T09:25Z,"Why can't someone just simply comment with a keygen code? that's all I need. I don't need to be downloading this questionable application when I already have it, just need the serial number!"
