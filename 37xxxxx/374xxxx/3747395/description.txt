Here is the full Astro Boy series form the 80s

All of the files are english audio only with no subtitles except 2.

The dvd's had the first two episodes of the japanese series included. They are japanese audio with eng subtitles. You should watch these if you are a fan as it explains alot about how atlas came to be and you get an idea of how much more....evil the series was in japanese before they butchered it for english tv. This whole substory has been removed from the english series....

Pity it's only the first two eps, would love to get the whole series.

Anyways these are dvdrips...get the other encodes that are uploaded, he-man, voltron,ulysses 31.....enjoy

DVDRIPS good quality.
