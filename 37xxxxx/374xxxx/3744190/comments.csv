(BTW - Thanks To those that are continuing to assist in seeding)"
,c0mplex,2007-08-03T15:01Z,"I feel your pain, I hate when its says its been downloaded 9000 times and there is 3 seeders! I already have the DVD versions of this, I was looking for Ultimatum, but I will DL and seed for you."
,fafner_HK,2007-08-05T07:39Z,Any technical details on quality? It stutters somewhat when I play it.
,EvanStz,2007-09-01T21:08Z,"Quality is OK, though I would have preferred an aXXo release.
8/10 for both movies.
I am seeding now."
,robinhood12345,2007-10-19T21:28Z,is there anyone out there who want to seed this for me?
