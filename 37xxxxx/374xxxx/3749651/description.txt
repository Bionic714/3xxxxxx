Overview:	A year before he was to direct "King Boxer"--the first Hong Kong kung-fu film ever to break into the international market--Cheng Chang-Ho both wrote and directed this powerful martial arts movie. Ling Yun, of "Gun Brothers" and "Hellgate" (among many others), ably plays a magician-warrior who initially protects the villain from an ambush by the title heroes. But after his wife's and friend's deaths, he must fight to set things right.
