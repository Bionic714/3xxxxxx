,hgomez,2007-07-15T16:09Z,"Sorry, my upload isn't that great. I'm trying to track some people down that can help me seed this one..."
,daphne0,2007-08-23T07:49Z,"The tracker has been down for days, but what I got before that was great.  Excellent quality.  I used VLC to switch the audio to the commentary.  Good stuff!  (I hope the tracker comes back soon...)"
,MalcolmReynolds,2007-08-29T09:27Z,"Dude, I'll love you forever. The quality seems to be sound (Have downloaded episode 1 and 2 now and saw them, still downloading the rest). But not only that, you even included subtitles for every one of them, which is for me far more important!
I wish more people would include subtitles (hard of hearing and deaf people will love you forever!)"
,ste09048,2007-11-07T22:45Z,"just downloaded will seed 4 ages

,NeitherSparky,2007-12-16T04:59Z,"*starts dl'ing*

Keep this seeded please guys. ;) I also promise to help seed this after I get it, I have a computer for which seeding is one of its few purposes. Thanks! :)"
,NeitherSparky,2007-12-27T06:54Z,"This is a *great* torrent, I spent today watching season one. :) Thanks for mentioning VLC player, I wasn't bright enough to figure out how to play it without subtitles and without the commentary. ;)"
,Darkstorm1o1,2008-01-21T09:29Z,"I just started downloading this, and I will seed this for as long as my computer lives. Great show."
,ai45,2008-01-27T18:04Z,Please seed!
,Slakpad,2008-02-21T20:18Z,"great up, just got it. To few seeders looking at the amount of leechers, so i'll be seeding at about 2000 kB/s the comming few days. I do expect everyone to do his bit when done, since it's quite a big file.

These series are great, everyone should see them! "
,dartb,2008-02-22T04:18Z,"Dear god, this torrent is made of win.  Nobody is seeding though... FOR THE LOVE OF CHRIST SEED THE 17GB TORRENT!"
,viper62,2008-02-23T06:32Z,seed please I need some reality
,lostboybinns,2008-03-03T02:51Z,So has anyone tried stand alone players with these files? hhmm I wonder if theres an option to turn the commentary off on divx files on players?
,azerbaijani,2008-03-20T12:27Z,"please seed, im stuck at like 20kb/s, taking forever :("
,Lew08,2008-03-20T17:25Z,"Does anyone know how to turn the voices/commentary in the background off? I've tried many times, but with no luck :("
,azerbaijani,2008-03-21T02:52Z,"cmon seed people, at this rate its gonna take me 3weeks!! :@"
,herndon39,2008-03-25T21:26Z,perhaps i a bit too new but does anyone know how to turn off the commentary.  does it disappear when burned to dvd?
,leftboy,2008-04-02T06:42Z,Herndon39 - read the comments. They use VLC media player and change the audio track. Simple!
,ausgarth,2008-04-16T16:33Z,"I know there are some issues with the sound, is it possible to burn it to DVD and watch it on the telly with out any commentary?"
,23h,2008-04-17T16:48Z,"Just wanted to say thanks to those currently seeding. Tried another Red Dwarf torrent before and never got beyond 5% and took a week or more to get that far.

This one currently one of the highest speed downloads I've had.

Please keep it up as I only have 4% but that has all come down today.

A double Rimmer to you all."
,viper62,2008-04-18T06:10Z,18 days later still at 74%

Just 18 Hours to go, and i'll continue seeding :)"
,mrDesman,2008-05-11T10:07Z,"Man, that's awesome! Was looking for the complete series for ages!"
,hgomez,2008-05-25T23:49Z,"All, 

as I've mentioned in the comments, if you use VLC there is absolutely NO problem switching between the audio tracks. Using mplayer, it plays the first audio track as well and there's a command line option to turn it off. As XBMC uses mplayer, it too plays the videos just fine and even detects the second audio stream. 

As far as disabling one of the tracks to burn to a DVD goes, my suggestion is to do this: open it in VirtualDubMod, go under ""Streams -> Stream List,"" then disable the ones you don't want to hear in your new file, ""Video -> Direct Stream Copy,"" and then save as a new file. 

Glad to see that so many people are still enjoying the torrent!

""Stoke me a clipper - I'll be back for Christmas"""
,hgomez,2008-05-26T00:11Z,"And if you are on a Linux distro, then I recommend using the cross platform program AVIDemux.

and correction from above: ""mplayer "" will play the video with the 1st audio track active. The option to change the audio track from the command line is ""-aid n"" where n is the track number, starting with 1 and increasing."
,TranceMan007,2008-08-01T10:45Z,"To hgomez - don't know how bad the sound is on the shows you're watching, but the line is ""Smoke me a Kipper - etc etc"" (as Ace Rimmer uses this a couple of times)...."
,unpocoloco,2008-11-22T09:37Z,"Red Dwarf A Anniversary Edition - All the Shows, have just been released on DVD PAL only £33.98 for 10 DVDs on Amazon.UK. 
Vilket blir ca 450:- för oss svenskar, snuskigt billigt får man nog allt säga.. 


"
,narmour,2009-05-28T01:24Z,"To all people who have watched a lot of the episodes =

Are these FULL episodes? Or the cheap Japanese 25 Minute cut episodes?
Episodes should range from 25-30 minutes if you're unsure.
Will keep on seed list if torrent contains full episodes. Cheers."
,DigChrono,2009-08-18T23:24Z,"my up speed is 30 kpbs
