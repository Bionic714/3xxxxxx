,CMANHG,2007-07-19T17:25Z,"An additional quote from a review for this concert:

""[This] was Giordano's orchestral debut - and what a debut... ...Giordano carries us through the story with exquisite sensitivity... ...carefully interpreted... ...the phrases flow effortlessly from the piano... deeply engaged in the music... ...very promising for the future.""

M책ns Nilsson, Norrl채ndska Socialdemokraten, Sweden, October 29, 2001."
,CMANHG,2007-07-21T19:58Z,"Seeding is highly appreciated.

At times, nine people have been trying to download this torrent simultaneously when I apparently was the only one seeding. This results in so low download rates that people give up and stop downloading.

If you enjoyed the music, you may regard seeding it for a few days to other listeners as a suitable form of compensation."
,CMANHG,2007-07-30T21:07Z,"Three people are currently seeding, beyond myself. Thank you very much for this kindess. :-)"

Again - should no one be seeding, just send a mail to the MySpace or YouTube accounts given below:

http://www.myspace.com/manliogiordano

and

Do not give up if noone is seeding when you add the torrent - seeding will generally occur within a few days, at the most, if this computer has been shut off for some reason.

Of course seeding by others is always appreciated."
