,rma_burp,2007-07-22T14:04Z,"compared to the jpg leaks tagged as genuine by nytimes, yeah i think this is the real thing. oh, did I mention this is in .pdb format? I converted this for my old palm v using isilo app. "
,lizbetann,2007-07-22T21:21Z,Palm Reader couldn't open this file. :(
,goyena,2007-07-23T00:10Z,"Great work! I got the nice similar ISilo version from a Yahoo group. (links, images, etc.) One favor: can you repost this file, using ""ignore all colors"" and ""ignore text colors""? I use the prog ""Colorize"" to read at night (red text, black background), but your version has the colors locked in. "
