ORIGIN: Sweden FORMED IN: 2004 LABEL: Fold4 Records ALBUM: Bring on the heartache 

On a Gothenburg Tram in 2004, Pen Expers was formed. As a direct result of a Tindersticks concert, two close friends Alexander Arvman and Mikael Romanenko founded Pen Expers. However, the quintet as it stands today, took time to take shape. In fact it was not until the autumn of 2005 that the current line up was fully established. 

Since then, Pen Expers have earned themselves a great reputation on the live scene in Sweden, with their excellent mixture of influences from Joy Division, Interpol to Crime & The City Solution they?re serving up a set of short, sharp and punchy alternative modern rock tracks with an addictive and catchy pop element thrown in! Pen Expers have recently enjoyed successful appearances at the Hultsfred Rookie Festival and packed support slots with bands such as Convoj, as well as teaming up with new National signing Miss Li. 

The debut album Bring on the heartache is due for release through Fold4 Records in February 2007. The distorted, jangling guitar riffs combine with Arvman?s distinctive vocal presence to give a sound that viciously tears through the airwaves.
