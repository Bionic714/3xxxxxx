So unless you have a lot of time to waste trying to get these to work I would suggest downloading from a different ripper.

The logic of this guy eludes me. Why share files that very few people seem to be able to play.

I would advise downloading from a different ripper. It will save you a lot of bandwidth and a whole lot of hassle. Prolific he may be, but quantity is no substitute for quality."

,NeverEnuf80,2008-04-12T03:13Z,"Any of these bullsh!t codecs are scams. Clearly its a way to get some kind of harmful software on your computer! There is NO REASON besides malware to use a codec other than H264 for HD material. For standard def, H264 is still superior, but some seem to like xvid, for whatever reason. Why would any LEGITIMATE ripper use anything else?
You're being scammed here, beware!"
