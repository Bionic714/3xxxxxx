So unless you have a lot of time to waste trying to get these to work I would suggest downloading from a different ripper.

The logic of this guy eludes me. Why share files that very few people seem to be able to play.

I would advise downloading from a different ripper. It will save you a lot of bandwidth and a whole lot of hassle. Prolific he may be, but quantity is no substitute for quality."
