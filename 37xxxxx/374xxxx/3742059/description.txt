SYNOPSIS: When an earthquake triggers a giant burst of lava from the La Brea Tar Pits, sending great spews of lava all over various Los Angeles neighborhoods and causing all manner of flaming magma mayhem, dedicated Emergency Management director Mike Roark rushes to the rescue, with help from a plucky seismologist. A no-holds-barred cataclysmic extravaganza, replete with "lava bombs" bursting in air, a toned-down flirtatiousness between the city's saviors, and the straight-faced "how-will-we-stop-it?" suspense factor of the classic Hollywood disaster epics...
