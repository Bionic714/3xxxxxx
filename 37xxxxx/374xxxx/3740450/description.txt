Tremendous performance and a great job done with this release utilizing the good audience source and the available exc. 
SB as well for Stairway through Moby Dick. It's especially nice to hear a clean SB recording of Moby from '71. 
Bonzo plays what has to be the longest triplet finale of his solo ever. 
It's almost comical how long it goes on but it's absolutely killin' !! Reminds me of his wild ending solo on Whole Lotta Love from the last night at the Garden '73.
