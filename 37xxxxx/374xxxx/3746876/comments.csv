,deep_stroker,2007-07-19T18:05Z,"Hey..

I assume that this is the mp3 version?

-ssbmbj"
,Tech-Noir,2007-07-19T18:05Z,"Title Cutoff; This is MP3 VBR format. Takes less space than FLAC, but MP3 throws away data for smaller files."
,Tech-Noir,2007-07-19T18:06Z,"Deep_Stroker: Very correct, I don't upload alot of torrents so I didn't anticipate the title being cutoff. :)"
,Tech-Noir,2007-07-19T18:07Z,"Also, any criticism and comments are very welcome."
,FitMic,2007-07-22T08:35Z,"I will download this.

Any chance you will ""re-master"" ...And Justice For All album?
IMHO the best Metallica album, but is so horribly mixed."
,Tech-Noir,2007-07-23T00:03Z,"FitMic: Hey and thanks for the support. :)

Actually, another gentlemen in the FLAC version of this torrent also mentioned ""...And justice for all"". I am very positive. He said he had the original remaster and offered to upload some FLACs of it. I'll see what happens with that, but if I can get a hold of FLACs of that (I am assuming the remaster has the best mix of the bunch) I will certainly do my very best. I enjoy playing with audio. :)

So right now it looks liek I might do ""Justice"" next. It is always the most fun to work on poorly mixed or equalized albums where there is potential for huge improvements, and since you say it is poor quality-wise, it will probably be interesting. :)"
,Crovean,2007-07-23T05:36Z,"Want something interesting? :) Remaster Kill 'Em All... that album needs some thickness!

Great upload btw!"
,FitMic,2007-07-23T10:00Z,"How the h3ll do I send you a PM?
Would you like me to upload the ...And Justice For All album in FLAC?"
,Tech-Noir,2007-07-23T15:00Z,"Crovean: I might get to that one in the future. ;)


FitMic: I've no idea. For a good while I have not seen the ""Private Messages"" part in my user preferences. I'm thinking they have disabled PMs at the moment.

As for ""...And Justice For All"", do you know if it is the Remastered version? Or can you say anything about the audio quality compared to other releases of it?

If it isn't alot of troubles, do upload it and let me know. I'll download it and then perhaps compare it to the Remastered if that get's uploaded aswell. I have a 320K MP3 of some release, but not sure which one it is, doesn't say anything about it.

But like I said, only if it's not any trouble. ;)"
,FitMic,2007-07-23T15:39Z,"To be honest, I am not sure if there really was a remaster of ...And Justice For All
"
,FitMic,2007-07-23T15:43Z,"...And Justice For All was released as a remaster in 1995. 

My bad!"
,FitMic,2007-07-23T15:47Z,"I found this torrent, it might perhaps be useful for you:

,Tech-Noir,2007-07-23T16:17Z,"Hehe, I only knew because someone said they owned a Remaster. ;)

As for the torrent, I'll wait just a bit before I download it. It is a mighty size and it doesn't really say which version it is. But thanks for letting me know of it. ;)"
,FitMic,2007-07-24T18:47Z,"Here's ...And Justice For All (FLAC-version)

,nylunel,2007-08-06T11:11Z,"Master of puppets have never sounded better! 
So why not do the same with Ride the lightning? You probably know that both these records have been remastered on gold discs. I have listened to them, but was not so impressed. the general feeling is that they were to cautious. I would have wanted it to sound more like your version, thatÂ´s why I was so impressed when I listened to it.  // Niklas"
,konkelpatte,2007-08-11T15:48Z,"seed, please"
,sataan_666,2007-08-22T15:20Z,seed plz
,FitMic,2007-08-23T13:47Z,"Tech-Noir>>

,Tech-Noir,2007-08-27T03:48Z,I uploaded a few more. Check em out. :)

,JoshM22,2008-01-21T01:54Z,Thanks so much for this. I will be listening to this version from now on. Not so harsh on the ears at high volumes. Once again Thank you very much.
,Dumbass21,2008-02-05T00:00Z,Thanks man.. Seems like u put alot of effort into this so I taught id let ya no I appreciate it..
,Tech-Noir,2008-02-12T00:07Z,Cheers all. :)
,FatFreddy247,2008-02-16T00:24Z,"great effort, how many hours to get it like this?"
,Tech-Noir,2008-02-16T13:21Z,"Cheers mate. :)

Well, it took maybe 2 days. I could have done it faster, but I like to take my time and try lots of different things."
,lemson,2008-03-05T17:52Z,"I just want to thank you for this great sound you give to the best metal album ever!!!
You lifted it to a new level,much better than original.
God bless you my son.
Keep on with other metal albums that suffer from bad production.
CHEERS!!!"
,Tech-Noir,2008-03-05T18:45Z,"Thanks mate, very glad you found some use out of it. :)"
,drammen08,2008-03-22T03:55Z,"thanx a lot man! c ya all in slaski, poland on may 28! :)"
,midwestern72,2008-03-29T23:36Z,Thank you! Now how about a re-master of ...And Justice For All??
,Askolin,2008-03-30T00:51Z,"Thx for the dl, and a good job! u can really hear the noise difference on the quiet parts and an overall sound improvemant, u can hear the instruments more individually. thx"
,roryrattlehead,2008-04-04T13:48Z,"i got all 3 of your remastered albums,ride sounds way better,master quite good,but i think you made the guitars on justice a little bit to flat,still good job man :) what program did you use by the way?"
,bHabicht,2008-08-24T19:47Z,"Man, I hope I'm not disappointed by this. I absolutely love Master of Puppets, and the original sound of the album is part of the reason. It's a classic..it's supposed to sound like a classic. And amateur remastering very rarely ever turns out well..especially on such a great, popular classic such as MoP. I gurantee it'll ruin the entire feel of the album. It'd be like independent film-makers trying to redo ""Gone With The Wind""..you just can't pull it off without the proper experience."
,bHabicht,2008-08-24T22:57Z,"As I assumed, this is total shit. There is NO bass in any of these songs anymore. You can hear the bass lines, but there's no actual bass to it. And there's absolutely no bass to the music overall. It's just guitars and drumming. The guitar sounds great..that's the only positive on this. The drumming sounds flat, no bass, and the vocals still have the classic echo sound to them, which is great, but sounds way out of place with what's been done here. All together, it really makes this album sound horrid. You should be ashamed.

You even mentioned you'd never even heard Master of Puppets before..and that you're into trance and electronica music? So apparently you're not mcuh a Metallica listener..SO DON'T FUCK WITH IT.

Fucking faggot."
,Tech-Noir,2008-08-25T11:36Z,"Don't worry, I rarely take things personally. ;)

The original is still in existence, obviously. You are completely free to decide to listen to whatever you want, and not listen to whatever you want.

I do find your ""Gone with the wind"" analogy sort of misplaced. If this had been a cover of reproduction of Master Of Puppets, then it would be appropriate.
What I've done would be more along the lines of color correction and similar processes.

As for the bass issue you mention, there is basically no bass in the original either. The bassguitar is undermixed, and it hasn't got an emphasis on it's lower frequencies, meaning it works more like a 3rd guitar than adding a solid foundation.

Also you mention the vocals having the classic echo to them. Again I'm not sure what you were expecting. Working with stereo audio mixdowns, there is very little changing you can do. Changing the properties of one instrument without affecting others is basically impossible unless the instruments are clearly confined to their own frequency ranges. Things like reverb and ambience are part of the sound, nestled into the frequency spectrum. I could for example mono the sound, which would remoe the illusion of stereo space. But the vocals would still have a characteristic roomy feel to them, akin to listening to someone sing through a narrow gap in a door. Not enveloping ambience, but a voice colored by lots of room sound. Also monoing the sound would obviously affect any instruments that had any sort of stereo data to them.


Thanks for your input though, very appreciated. Though I probably would have respected your opinions even more with a slightly less hostile tone. Not saying you aren't entitled to voice your opinion (it's the internets after all...), but less profanity generally makes people more susceptible and accepting of input, criticism and suggestions. :)"
,mrjonez,2008-10-11T11:13Z,Great job! Enjoy your versions. Waiting for more to come...
,Tech-Noir,2008-10-19T18:46Z,Thanks. :)
,randypagan,2008-11-14T00:39Z,"This sounds amazing!! thank you so much!! I was afraid metallica would try to remaster this album and fuck it up.

 Is there any chance of you taking a crack at meatloaf ""Bat out of hell""? Personally, I think it is the worst sounding cd I have ever heard. it actually sounds worse than the vinyl lp."
,goochwrott,2008-12-15T00:18Z,"thx 4 all ur hard work.

im trying 2 burn them (AJFA & MOP) using Nero but it wont let me. i cant even add them 2 my burn list. it says i need a plug in. can u help? 
plz email me if u can.........gooch.wrott@live.com

thx again"
,goochwrott,2008-12-15T00:22Z,"oops.

,Audio-Phile907,2008-12-20T16:51Z,"damn, whats up with all the hate? If you dont like it, dont listen to it. It is pretty fucking hard making something that had a shitty source into something better sounding for sure.
BTW, it sounds damn good in my truck! i have my subwoofer playing the kick 60hz and below, midbass drivers crossed @ 60hz-200hz and that picked up a decent sounding bassline, and i like the vocals in this too, no audible clipping, and IT SOUNDS AWESOME!!!!! All my friends liked it too GOOD JOB"
,Tech-Noir,2009-01-17T09:58Z,"Thanks for the comments, glad that some found it useful and/or more listenable. :)"
,Travis001,2010-05-11T08:41Z,"Hey man. I'm trying to download a few of your remastered torrents, but I'm having little to no luck seeing as nobody is seeding them. So, is there any chance you could e-mail me a few songs? I'll keep the torrent going of course, but at this rate, god knows when they'll be done haha."
