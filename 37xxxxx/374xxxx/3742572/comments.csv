,coditza,2007-09-10T11:03Z,"It seems that there are a couple of discrepancies between this movie and the wikipedia article related to this battle (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Najaf_%282004%29):

armored vehicles got damaged (in the wiki);
the coalition troops rebuilt the area (movie);
the dates: wiki sais the battle ended on 27 August, movie has a footage that shows the battle ended on 15 august (or the guys camera had a wrong date)

Anyone has other sources of info about this battle?"
