King Eagle (1970) - REMASTERED

Avg. Rating:  	
  4 / 5 (based on 2 ratings).

Plot:	The cool thing about King Eagle is that we can marvel at greatness during its humble beginnings. Ti Lung's future, lone, wandering, swordsman characters can be traced to this Chang Cheh directed film. We also witness a breakout action role for Li Ching.
