,Diript,2011-04-24T23:40Z,How do I record this to play in my ps2? I've cd boot.
,Jinx_Dojo,2012-07-24T16:30Z,"This worked fine on my fat NTSC console. I used Free McBoot with ESR ( http://freemcboot.info ).

For those that don't know, Free McBoot is an exploit you can place on your memory card to get the PS2 to launch homebrew. ESR is a particular piece of homebrew that allows playing burned games. However, one must ""patch"" the game using the ESR Patching tool for PC.

I followed the installation guide here:
http://freemcboot.info/ps2%20ohje/indexe.html

However, more experienced users could follow this installation guide:
http://freemcboot.info/swap.html

Once you activate the exploit (i.e. can run homebrew), go here to update your Free McBoot installation:

Also, look for ""ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a.rar"" at the bottom of this forum post:

I hope this helps!"
