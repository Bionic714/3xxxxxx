The problem is that you are using a crap
program. Try windows media player,
maybe also get a k-lite codec pack as well"
,yzefan,2007-07-21T08:31Z,"Good cam version. Sound and picture are good

Keep in mind its not going to be as good as the theater but what do you expect for free..

,rperron,2007-08-01T06:05Z,Either I have a problem with the first 1/3 audio or what he means by crappy audio for the first 1/3 of the movie is that it is completely uncomprehendable.  The 2nd 2/3s is fine but you can't understand anything on the first 1/3.  Can anyone suggest a solution?  Or is this version just crap.
,starscream_88,2007-08-01T10:50Z,"Picture is great, sound not so much. Why is it that almost every copy of this I download has shitty sound for the first 30mins? Can anyone direct me to a copy that has decent sound all the way through!?"

Just be sure to use VLC and change the audio setting to mono."

uninstall the codec you installed, then

download VLC it will play avi for you & its free

sinopse
Durante séculos, duas raças de alienígenas robóticos - os Autobots e os Decepticons - travaram uma guerra, com o destino do universo em jogo. Quando a batalha chega à Terra, tudo o que separa os terríveis Decepticons do poder supremo é uma pista na posse do jovem Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf). Um adolescente normal, Sam é consumido com preocupações diárias sobre a escola, amigos, carros e raparigas. Sem saber que ele é a última hipótese de sobrevivência da humanidade, Sam e a sua amiga Mikaela (Megan Fox) encontram-se no meio de uma guerra entre os Autobots e os Decepticons. Com o destino do mundo por um fio, Sam compreende o verdadeiro significado do mote da família Witwicky: ""Sem sacrifício não há vitória!""."

I asked how to download.
It's easy, just get a program like azureus(I'm useing that one :P)
then you just download that file and opens it with your downloading program, quite easy maybe bad exponeytion(sorry bad spelling XD)


Good luck!"
