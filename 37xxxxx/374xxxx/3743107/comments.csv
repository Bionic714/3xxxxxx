,Dizzious,2010-03-09T16:00Z,"Anyone who wants this program, but is having problems getting it via Torrent, can download it right from the author's website - it's FREEWARE meaning there is no reason to ""pirate"" it.

Download the contents of both of the links in the ""English"" section and stick them into the same folder. No crack or anything needed - like I said, this is FREEWARE. "
