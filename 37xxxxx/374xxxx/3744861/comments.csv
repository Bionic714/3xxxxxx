0.6kB/s ain't cool."
,edragn,2007-08-11T17:42Z,I would seed if I could get the whole file: but like you state it is stuck on 79.1 % and no seeders!
,semprini,2007-08-22T06:36Z,"Damn, you guys are impatient.  It's a big file, and my internet connection drops occasionally.  I'm seeding and will continue to do so for a long time yet.  Please be patient!

,Trtie45ie,2008-05-28T02:44Z,Where in hell are all the fucking seeders that show on here.  All I got up to is 15.4%.  All the other peers on there have the same thing.  Why post something if you are not going to have at least on seeder that has 100%
