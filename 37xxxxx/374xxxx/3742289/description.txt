      Â² This one-hour special takes a thrilling look back at the first    Â²
      Â° four Harry Potter books and movies, and looks ahead to Harry's    Â°
        new film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, that's
        based on the fifth book in author J.K. Rowling's series. We'll
        search for clues in the previous episodes that might tip us off
        to what's coming up. We'll look at Voldemort's growing influence
        , the new Death-Eaters by his side, and the unsettling new turn
        by Cornelius Fudge and his minions. Includes interviews from the
        young stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson,
        along with their veteran counterparts including Gary Oldman
        (Sirius Black), Ralph Fiennes (Voldemort) and many of the other
        returning cast members. We'll also some of the newest cast
        members, including Imelda Staunton as the formidable Dolores
        Umbridge, and Helena Bonham Carter as the evil Bellatrix
        LeStrange. All in all, this program's a delectable treat for
        Harry's legions of fans, young and old.
