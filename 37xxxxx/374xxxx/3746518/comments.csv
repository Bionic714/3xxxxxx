,PikKirby,2008-06-03T07:51Z,"nice torrent, but i dont use daemon so a iso file could've been more convenient.. seeding :P


Help for noobs.

.cue files are shortcuts. (useless junk, dont bother downloading)
.bin files are almost same as .iso's

Alcohol cant read .bin's. only .iso.'s

If you have Daemon just mount the .bin's..easy.

If you have Alcohol download MagicISO and convert the .bin into a .iso "

,redwall,2009-02-09T22:59Z,"@PikKirby

before you go saying .cue files are usless junk then you should try using them... Alcohol reads .cue files to mount .bin files (.cue files are easily created with notepad so even if u dont wanna download a less then 1MB file then u can create after you d/l


Context of most .cue files(opened in notepad):

FILE ""file.bin"" BINARY
  TRACK 01 MODE1
    INDEX 01 00:00:00


and thats all a .cue file is for.... just replace 'file.bin with the actual filename and save it as a .cue file and alcohol will pick it and and run the cd like normal

if you have any issues then check spelling and make sure ur .cue file matches ur .bin file

if they the same then resort to ur local search engine(yahoo, google, ask)"

THIS GAME WORKS!
extract everything via PowerISO, put EVERY file in cd1 map, then install. At the end of the installation it says to insert cd1-just press cancel copy the crack over the executable en IT WORKS!!! 



ps gaiodiaz you are an idiot never heard of powerISO?"

,Naruto_TB,2010-01-30T22:33Z,"Hey,I got the game to install--Took me about 15mins to figure it out but--here are the steps how i installed the game with Poweriso.

1)Make sure you have your power iso set to read "".bin"" files
-Open Power Iso
-At the top click ""Options""
-Configuration
-Check mark bin(i have them all checked now,but neways)

2)CD 1 Should now be in the form of a gold disc.
-Right Click the larger file(the one thats obviously not 1kb)
-Poweriso-->Mount image
-A new window should pop up/assuming you have your virtual drive setup
-click on the Setup.exe

3)Game should now install

Continue the same process when it ask for dis 2,3,4.Hope this helps.Hope i dont get ragged on for missing a step,TO be onest what i did was created 4 virtual cd drives-mounted all disc--and then in stalled,unmounted all disc afterwards except for when i play of course.This is the long way of doing things but this should be good for most new ppl at mounting etc..If it doesnt work,lve comment,will get back to you.

THanks Ipoppedherintheeye

,Lewis269,2010-06-23T06:15Z,"just download the files, and when it asks you to install it, simply mount each file with daemon when prompted,  easy as that, then copy the crack over and play. 

only use the powerISO method if you want to have all the files in one directory and don't want the fuss of mounting each disc separately "

,sfaddic182,2010-08-24T00:10Z,"NOOBS! first download magicstick,daemon or poweriso(it has mount already) first list the number of drivers do like 4 drives on all drives mount the 4 cd in that drives (large files) then it should automatically open but if it does not go to my computer then open the E: (if your using power iso) then open the file called setup then your done just install it"
,sfaddic182,2010-08-26T05:02Z,"Question!
I installed the game! 
using mounting the four cd's but when i look at my microsoft games it is only 500+mb so! do i need to delete the iso files because its not-important/so i only need to get the crack OR! do not delete the files because those .iso files have the other files of the game"
,ticius,2010-09-01T10:37Z,about d3dx9_27.dll. go to directory C:\WINDOWS\system32 and find d3dx9_ files. then make copy d3dx9_28.dll or d3dx9_26.dll in the same directory. after that rename this copy to d3dx9_27.dll. enjoy the game 
,shuriken_619,2010-10-02T05:48Z,"Lol there is a huge fuss about installing the game (especially helvete20 lol).Its Simple.
1.If u cant see the .bin files while trying to mount with Daemon Tools,just make the files of type to All Files.
2.Make 4 virtual drives for 4 of the data.
3.Open the Cd1 and run the setup and follow the instructions afterwards.
As i said its simple.:)"

,Amnestic,2012-02-21T16:52Z,"For anyone having issues with the quick battle not working. It's likely that at the end of the install, when it asks you to insert disc one again, you've remounted the first disc and ran the game. What you need to do is cancel when it asks for that, and then copy across the crack in the first .bin file. Hopefully that should sort any issues with certain parts of the game not working."
