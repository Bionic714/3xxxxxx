,thespidey,2007-07-15T13:36Z,lol....I love it when console owners think that the console version is better than a PC version. 9 times outta ten the PC version will win. In this instance check the comparison chart from ubisoft website to see all the missing features in the 360 version compared to PC http://ghostrecon.uk.ubi.com/graw2/_img/graw2xbx_graw2pc.jpg
