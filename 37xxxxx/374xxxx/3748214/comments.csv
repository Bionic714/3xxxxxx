,supergrease,2007-12-02T19:01Z,"im a big fan of slipknot-but i say this album sugs....it sounds like jazz and little hip hop and rock , not that metal like the other slipknot albums..."
,Jason_sthlm90,2007-12-30T16:45Z,"Think this ablum is the one with Anders who later quit, he was a fag anyways and yea, the album sucks."
[T],killerdemon,2008-01-21T04:43Z,"I liked Anders more then Corey, Anders wrote the lyrics in a much more filosophical way imho."
,Alice_In_Chains,2008-03-21T06:13Z,"Yeah, MFKR isn't as good.. but you gotta understand.  This was back when they first started out, and they had a different singer, with different style of vocals, different style drums, guitar, etc. 

It's just different.  

I like it."
,Katmannsson,2008-06-23T21:05Z,"I'm going to be honest
Corey Sucks
Post-Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. Sucks
The Remake of Gently Sucks
Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.=Best Damn Slipknot album
My Opinion don't Flame me for it please
Some newer stuff (Mostly Self-Titled Digi-pack) was good and Some of the stuff off of Vol. 3 was good especially Scream, I liked Anders, I liked 1996 Slipknot if anyone has This on actual CD and they Don't want it Tell me I will try to work something out, My Favorite Slipknot Album ever"
,killgrinddevour,2008-08-11T09:15Z,"both corey & anders sucks!
slipknot is a fag!
try to listen to some more brutal shit like
Anal Cunt, Impending Doom or Pig Destroyer.


peace man."
,killgrinddevour,2008-08-11T09:15Z,"Both Anders & Corey sucks!

Grindcore rules"
,Joeggernaut,2008-08-17T23:00Z,"The best they done so far - raw and uncompromising metal. The first CD is the worst, there you have something that sucks - and vol3. Iowa and the first ""demo"" is best :) Cause this is originally a demo."
,Joeggernaut,2008-08-17T23:05Z,"Killinggrinddevouer>>>
Allow me to laugh at your pathetic face!
You talk about grind, and don't namedropp Carcass or Nasum...but Anal Cunt... You are just born in the wrong fucking century. Or not born human at all..."
,JamesBlond007,2008-08-25T12:59Z,"According to several people on the scene shortly after the attack, the boy arrived at school with at least three swords and several masks identical to those worn by heavy metal band Slipknot.  South Africa http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-08-18-swordwielding-schoolboy-kills-fellow-pupil"
,Dadutta,2009-01-22T18:21Z,this version of Gently is magnificent - especially with the acousitcs :))))))
,DIVON777,2009-03-14T15:39Z,"""killers are quiet"" was inspired by Craig....
i love Craig"
,Vapre,2009-07-10T07:17Z,"Dudes.. This was the begining of slipknot. No shit it sucks. It was where the pile of shit that is now known as slipknot sat and festered. It started to grow, and simmer in a pool of weird ass fucking noises. Where else would you think a band such as them would come from? Something good? A bunch of crazy ass fucks in a basement making music..
Need I say more?

stay sic."
,stypex,2009-09-27T02:25Z,"what people cant seem to grasp is that this shit is raw, creepy, straight up underground. there was no mimicking of anyone else's style becuase they defined their own. and seriously if you hate slipknot that much, then why are you on here bashing them, go download your own stuff and leave us maggots alone. but i will agree that anything after released after Iowa does indeed suck, becuase thats where they decided to start conforming to industry standards. i miss the creepiness...

and P.S. Andres was the shit, after he left Slipknot he was in a band called Painface that never got big was incredibly (sic) all the same."
,stypex,2009-09-27T02:26Z,and yes i know i have typos everywhere in my last comment.
,DeepHole,2011-04-27T19:47Z,Big thanks to you killerdemon!
,theforgoten,2011-09-26T06:05Z,what you talking about killgrinddevour Coreys awsome slipknots not a smoke and Anal Cunt is wierd as fuck 
,infyrno676767,2011-12-21T17:33Z,"Man, anal cunt isn't worthy of even being a band. Noise is shit. Music is inspirational. Hence: Stone Sour. Fucking amazing band. Slipknot is alright, but nothing super special. Some songs are wonderful. Other aren't. But between good and bad bands, I'd put my money on Slipknot any day. But its whatever. What's worse than Anal Cunt on the other hand is Mushroomhead. No good songs. At all. Great sound. Great masks. Shitfuck lyrics. I'm off of here though and back to Zelda for the SNES with ramen noodles and Stone Sour Come What(ever) May. Later y'all."
,JoabW,2012-03-12T21:41Z,"I fucking love this. I've been listening to Slipknot for the last 6 years and only discovered this album the other day.
Got to say that this and Crowz album are awesome

Confessions, Killers Are Quiet, Coleslaw and Carve are some of the best 'Knot songs."
