The prototype of the girl next door is often invoked in American contexts to indicate wholesome, unassuming, or "average" femininity; this is contrasted with other stereotypes such as tomboy, valley girl, and slut. She is the female counterpart to the "boy next door." To fall in love with the "girl next door" is an archetype of romantic fiction and a key plot element. Unlike the femme fatale, the girl next door does not have hidden plans of her own, partly because her character is open and straightforward, and also partly because her intentions would not need to be concealed. Unlike the princess lointaine, she is seldom much richer or of much higher social status than the protagonist. The girl next door is most likely someone the protagonist has known for most of his (or her) life, but in the past could not appreciate the depth of her feelings because of his age.

The girl next door is always physically in close range, yet at the same time detached from the male protagonist (she does not necessarily have to live next door). She is the sweet girl he sees every day, a really great friend, or the perfect girl to bring home to his parents. She is often a virgin. Due to her innocent manner, many erotic fantasies portray the "girl next door" image as a pretense behind which a real woman is secretly very sexual. This friction in the archetype is a key element in the 2004 film The Girl Next Door.
