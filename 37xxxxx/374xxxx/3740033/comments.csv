,izprince,2007-08-10T23:31Z,"This is infected with a virus, it loads JKE.exe as a Windows system service, and uses a modified copy of MIRC to log you onto an IRC server, once there your computer is a zombie and can be used for whatever purpose the person who posted this file wants it to do, most likely a spam relay."
,heemax3000,2007-08-11T21:09Z,"I dont wanna spend my time hacking personal computers! before i've uploaded this torrent, i have used a antivirus. 
i think u got this JKE.exe after using sh1777 of internet explorer. use firefox!
Please if you have found some virus in this ISO image comment here and i remove this torrent!
"
,jovanka,2007-08-22T02:49Z,"So, virus inside or not?"
,jdoubles,2007-08-24T16:43Z,"How did you determine there was a virus? 

I installed it in vmWare and scanned it with 3 on-line scanners and found nothing.

Also searched for jke.exe"
,bikeclips63,2007-08-30T00:05Z,"I just installed this to my old pc. Runs real quick. No problems  so far.

Have scanned it with AVG anti-virus and Spybot. No problems found.

No unusual internet traffic shows up on my ZoneAlarm firewall either.

I always use Firefox or Opera web browsers.

Thanks  heemax3000."

""...i think u got this JKE.exe after using sh1777 of internet explorer. use firefox!...""


lol... fire fox sucks.... i used that SH*T and i almost had to reinstall windows xp..... and that was right after i heard that FIREFOX HAS SOME SORT OF BACK DOOR FOR SHIT LIKE THAT TO GET IN!!!!!!! DONT USE FIREFOX!!!! USE OPERA!!!! or if you realy want to use IE7...."
,wtcamer,2007-11-29T17:24Z,"lol stargate... nearly every program has security issues... Firefox has less than a 1/10 of what IE7 has. Opera i would say is safer on the web, but 90% of the good programs don't work properly w/ opera b/c it has bad support. Fastest browser ever... but bad support. Don't kick firefox cause u went to some g@y poRn site."

,wolverine5,2008-01-12T00:02Z,"DONT DOWNLOAD THIS SHIT!!!!
It containts DELTTSUL.EXE virus.

This dropper malware arrives from a remote system using the filename DELTTSUL.EXE.
Will keep conecting with remote Ip's
Antivirus program doesnt see any problems but firewall confirms that."
,tetsuo89,2008-02-05T20:49Z,"Thankyou Heemax3000!! I hosed my win2000 setup a week ago and couldn't find my cd anywhere.  It has been difficult finding a version on the web that actually works. Didn't find any viruses and have confirmed that with Norton and AVG, plus I used some tools from Sysinternals to verify there were no viruses accessing the internet. I also used a few rootkit detectors and have found nothing. Thank you for a clean release :) "
,Artuir,2008-03-25T04:05Z,"Guys, this IS windows 2000. It is extremely vulnerable to viruses out in the wild. Some don't even need you to install or run anything to get in. If you're putting 2000 on your boxes do not connect it to the internet until you've put an antivirus program on it, at the very least! It's an exploit using IIS 5.0 which comes preinstalled in Win2k and XP. Research W32/Welchia on google."
,heemax3000,2008-04-01T17:33Z,"hey i have checked everything before upload it. these people are complaining about viruses perhaps they are installing something and then responsable for the viruses AFTER WIN2k Installation!

Win2000 have many vulnerabilities even it has SP4 integrated. So i dont have fault if these people use Explorer(the main source of plagues) and navigate on P0rn or some sh17s on the net!

Protect themselves with a good antivirus and firewall!!

,HorsePleasure,2008-04-03T05:43Z,"I have installed this on a pair of Thinkpads a couple of months ago, and it has worked great.

The only issues were a screen res. driver on one and sound driver on the other. Choosing a different driver fixed the sound (on the T23) and downloading a driver fixed the video (on the A21E)

delttsul.exe is a Text To Speech Engine, assuming the file is genuine MS.

This is easily removed if desired. 

Oh, and install Firefox for your browser.

Thanks for this Win2000 download. "
,Pegleggedous,2008-05-09T23:59Z,"I think all of you people complaining about viruses in this release are unaware that you need to run a firewall with win2k. If you don't you WILL get viruses, regardless of who released the ISO.

Run a firewall, period."
,labsONE,2008-07-23T06:03Z,"I have to say, for months I've downloaded and re-downloaded this torrent and used it probably more than a Thai hooker.

I would like to stop and say thanks for uploading it. It's helped me recover more than a few PCs.
