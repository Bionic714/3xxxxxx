Intro-Following in the tradition of the original Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal 2000 delivers enough 
shock value to give it the same cult status. Viewers who enjoyed the original, will no doubt 
also be thrilled with this sequel. I liked many aspects of this film, and will look forward 
to seeing more and more adult oriented American animation. My guess, is that Columbia chose 
to release this film straight to DVD because of it?s limited target audience. I would have 
liked to see this movie make it to my local cinema, but it was probably not a profitable 
choice to market and distribute Heavy Metal 2000 to theaters. Fans of hard rock music and violent 
cartoons will be drawn to this film.

Story-When lowly space pirate Tyler finds the key to the chamber of immortality, it turns him into
 a maniacal killer bent on mayhem and destruction. FAKK2, a woman of the planet Eden, takes it upon 
herself to kill Tyler when he devastates her home world. Assisted by various forms of aliens and monsters 
along the way, FAKK2 and Tyler?s destiny?s become intertwined. She must race to find Tyler before he 
reaches the chamber of immortality, and becomes unstoppable. FAKK2 is not looking to save the world,
she just wants revenge.

Heavy Metal 2000 features the voice talents of Micheal Ironside as Tyler, B-movie actress Julie Strain
 as FAKK2, and Billy Idol in a toned down performance as the priest Odin.

This film is rated R for some extremely mature animated scenes. Like the original, sex is used extensively,
 and the violence is gore-filled and bloody. Profanities are used a bit much in my opinion, but that
 is what you get from a movie that is trying to break rules.
