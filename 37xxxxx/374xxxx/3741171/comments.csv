It was nice to have the tracks separately too, cos I like to be able to put them on a CDr and to be able to jump straight to a favorite track. There is too much here for one CDr, so that's another reason why it's handy to have the individual tracks. I downloaded another set where the tracks were not separated and it was hard to chop it up."
