For some reason I am the only one at the moment seeding this dvd. I already have a ratio of 2:1. I will keep seeding until more of you have it. But: I am looking for a few friendly people who want to help me out with: DVD 5 and DVD 7. Those are going SO incredibly slow. If anyone can help, please, I would appreciate it.
