Professional Punter's Form Analysis (PPFA) provides an in depth analysis tool for Bet Selector users that will save invaluable time when assesing form and assist all Bet Selector users in all aspects of using the program. As most Bet Selector users are aware, several manual adjustments need to be made to update the data to take into consideration wet tracks, jockeys, past form, distance, barrier position and track capability for each runner. This is a time consuming exercise and accuracy can be compromised in an attempt to save time. After many years of manually making these adjustments, a fully automated program has now been completed that will reduce many hours of analysis down to minutes with uncanny accuracy.

PPFA Quaddie Buster has been created to assist Punters in placing Quaddie & Treble bets with Australian TAB's. You may use traditional ALL-WAYS betting or Quaddie Buster's unique system which reduces the overall investment dollars. Using the Quaddie Buster System, as long as one TOP RATER wins one leg, then any winning selection from the other legs will result in a winning ticket.

PPFA Quaddie Buster allows you to select a Percenatge to bet for Flexi betting in NSW & Victoria, or multiples of Half Units for other States. PPFA Quaddie Buster will then produce the Ticket Text required to place the bet. This is simply copied to the On-Line TAB you are using.

Quaddie Buster may be suitable for Pick4 in other countrys.
