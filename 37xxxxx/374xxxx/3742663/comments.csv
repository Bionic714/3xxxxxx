,dellboys,2008-03-18T17:22Z,"Would there be any chance of just getting DVD 4.
My download is limited to just 10gig a month. and have used 8gig. "
,dellboys,2008-03-22T22:29Z,"Why are there only a few comments and seeders. This DVD set should have 1.000s of downloaders. There is no comment about the quailty of this download. and why is it such a big down load. as there is more than one dvd' why not put them out one by one. its a bit risky downloading such a big file just to find it wont play.
So come on, lets have some more info please."
