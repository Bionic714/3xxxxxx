This is a higher quality format of the show that has been catching on elsewhere for doctor who 2005. the good thing about it is that its normally the same 350mb file size as the xvids but much higher quality.

[b]Ep Desc:[/b] Rose and the newly-regenerated Doctor continue their adventures together in this Christmas Special episode. Christmas becomes a time of terror for Planet Earth, as the whole of mankind falls under the shadow of the alien Sycorax. Rose needs the Doctor's help, but can she trust a man with a new face? 

here is a rip of the doctor who xmas 2005 special for those that want a smaller file size than 1100mb. even though this is half the file size now, its still a little higher video bitrate than the other 42-45min 350mb x264 files (which are 950-1030 on avg and this is 1163kbps). encoded with AutoMKV with x264 insane quality like all the others from Alma99er and MM. it took a little longer then i wanted to do this because i had to find out how to get automkv to re-encode a .mkv file with out crashing. 
cheers to Alma99er/MM for Doctor who 2005 "HQ Edition" rips.
