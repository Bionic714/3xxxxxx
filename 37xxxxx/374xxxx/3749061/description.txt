I bought this about a year ago, so it is fairly old, but great fun to fly with.

Included in this are aircraft in BRITISH AIRWAYS, EASYJET, RYANAIR and BMI liveries.

These are complete installers for the aircraft.

These aircraft do not have a VC but some have cabin views with moving doors etc...

I use these to get from one place to another if it is of a distance of 200Miles or less.

Download, see what you think of them, and if you dont like them just uninstall using the unistaller provided.

If you do get rid of them just remember to seed what you have downloaded!

Enjoy!
