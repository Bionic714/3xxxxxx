Alright. Let's have some Q and A:

Q: Section 8, why are your mp4 releases so large?

A: I can spell it out real simply. They are of very high quality. They have not been resized and shrunk to a horizontal resolution of 640 like many releases. They retain their original horizontal resolution of 720. If you compare these releases to the original DVD material I think you will be hard pressed to notice a difference. The difference is transparent to the human eye. I encode my movies to be the same quality as the original material when viewed on my 92 inch HD screen.
