This is a collection of Articles, Books, and Text from The Troth (An Ã?satrÃº Orginization located here in The United States).

These various Articles and Texts were once availible to all who visited their website http://www.TheTroth.org many years ago and before then under their older name: The Kindred Spirits Hearth at http://w3.one.net/~dls/kspirits (site not exist anymore).

Unfortunately as the years past, these Articles and Text went missing with time (removed) and free online access to Their Book "Our Troth (first edition)" was made unavailable ever since the 2nd edition was published back in 2002.

Anyways, this is the complete collection of Asatru Articles, Text, and Resources saved from the original Troth orginization websites that were available to the public in their original html and pdf formats.
