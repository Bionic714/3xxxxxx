,bjoernhund,2009-03-22T08:10Z,"Relax people, it has TWO audio tracks. 
Use a player on your pc that has the possiblity of chosing audio tracks (like VLC player) 
or like I'm doing, ripping it to data disc as avi, playing it on my cheap stand-alone divX dvd-player 
where I can enjoy it on the telly and also chose which audio track I want. 
(Of course the English one, dumkopf! :-) )

Thanx for the upload! ;-9"

Great video and audio quality.
Thank you!"
