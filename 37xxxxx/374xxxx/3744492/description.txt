MRS. DALLOWAY is a romantic drama with deep psychological insight into the world of urban English society in the summer of 1923, five years after the end of World War I. During the course of a single June day, Clarissa Dalloway (Redgrave), a fashionable "perfect hostess" in her early fifties, confronts the decisions she made as a vibrant young woman thirty years before. She wonders if she was right to have chosen a safe, comfortable marriage to successful politician Richard Dalloway over the more romantic and adventurous life she could have had with her other suitor, Peter Walsh, who unexpectedly returns from India on this day of all days.
