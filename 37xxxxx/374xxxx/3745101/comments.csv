I have active@ISO burner and it just says error opening image.
Do I have to wait until all the remaining isos are downloaded or can any one recommend other software.
Cheers"

,gemineye674,2010-02-11T20:17Z,This torrent is BULLSHIT!  It took fukin 6 days to download and right at 99.9% it got an error.  When I went to refresh it started it back at 0%!  Waste of fukin time people and waste of bandwidth!
