,QsD1,2007-07-23T12:05Z,How come this is so large? Xp normally fits on a CD. Are additional progs included? I assume RAID SATA drives do not add up to 1.5 GB extra

No Product Key or Activation needed on a clean install.
CD-Key (if needed): JD3T2-QH36R-X7W2W-7R3XT-DVRPQ

You also have the choice of booting these following options once you insert the DVD:

  Install Windows XP 
  ERD Commander 2005
  Partition Magic 8.05
  Ghost 2003
  Windows 98 SE Boot Floppy (with NTFS Support)

Pressing the Space bar at this menu will isntall Windows, otherwise it will just boot
back to your first HDD. Selecting numbers 1-4 will boot the other progams listed.

* This disc does support on RAID / SATA installations automatically, if for some reason 
the DVD does not detect your RAID or SATA, proceed to use the floppy disk provided with 
your Hard Drive.

* After your PC has installed the first set of files and rebooted, there is a delay in 
the time where it takes to show the XP Installation screen (where is asks for your Name 
and other information). This is due to the DriverPacks that are included, and may take 
some time on a slower machine to complete (as it even takes a faster computer a little 
while do get past this stage).

* After Windows (and the additional programs) are installed, a good idea is to use a
program like TweakUI for example to disable the auto-logon of the Administrator account
(that's if you wish to do that ofcourse), then reboot. After you've logged in to your
Administrator account, feel free to change the password and account name to something else,
it's a good idea not to leave your Admin account called Administrator for security.
