SINOPSIS:
Based on the book by C.S. Lewis, this is a family-friendly movie. During World War II, four British kids discover that a wardrobe in the house where they're staying is a portal to an alternate world called Narnia. That world, which is ruled by the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton), is inhabited by fantastic creatures. The kids have marvelous adventures in Narnia and try to set things right there with the help of a lion named Aslan (voice of Liam Neeson), who sacrifices himself and is resurrected.
