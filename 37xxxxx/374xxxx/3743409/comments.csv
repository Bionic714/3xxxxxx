The burn both the VIDEO_TS and the empty AUDIO_TS on to a dvd using whatever program you like. enjoy film. Sorry this is my first torrent upload and I couldn't figure out how to upload an empty folder or i would have done it for you."

burn with Nero by creating a new DVD-Video. Place all the files in the video_ts of the empty disc and burn. It's the easiest way to burn vob files."
,Nez_Who,2007-07-16T23:55Z,sorry no subs. didn't even think of it. I'll remember those w/my next download.
,Mattias1977,2007-07-18T15:14Z,"could you re-up this with subs? English is fine with me. Swedish also, but not a must =)"
,Nez_Who,2007-07-21T02:23Z,wish i could but i don't have the source disk anymore. sorry
