,Muzz_666,2007-07-18T08:51Z,Seed Please! I'm up and waiting
,Muzz_666,2007-07-18T19:42Z,Since i'm the only one downloading can you turn off super seeder?
,sonihei,2007-07-19T04:03Z,"sorry but im new to uploading torrents, how do i turn off the super seeder?"
,sonihei,2007-07-19T04:36Z,"i think my torrent is too large, do you want me to repeat it and slice it by 10s? what do you think guys?"
,Muzz_666,2007-07-19T06:27Z,"It is very large but atleast you made it so we can select the files (AVI's) that we want, Thanks.

As for the super seeding - check the help on section of your Torrent, BitComet right? I'm not too familuare with it to tell you how but it should be in the help section under options.


Thanks again. i'll leave this Downloading for the next week or so. 
I'm re-seeding as well."
,sonihei,2007-07-19T08:06Z,"i think i'll just delete this torrent, maybe tomorrow, bec i'll be creating just groups of 10s, in this way you can also choose the episodes you just want to download, and there should be more seeders, right? again for those who started downloading, i'm very sorry,

hoping for your understanding and consideration
thank you"
,Muzz_666,2007-07-20T00:51Z,We'll be waiting. Thanks

,holydave,2007-08-27T23:46Z,"If the host of this can seed I'd be much obliged.  I'm stuck at 58.5%, not able to dowload and only upload what I have.  If not, please inform me if you put up different blocks involving 51+ so I can help seed and downlaod those.  If it's not by Sunday the 2nd I probably won't be able to get it.  Thanks."
,KidSnipe,2007-09-02T05:30Z,It'd be cool if you could split this into individual episodes.  19.32 gigabytes is wwwaaaaayyyyy too big.  No one is going to seed and few people are going to spend days downloading.
,evanstapler,2007-10-01T02:09Z,This has 100 unnecessary files thanks to BitComet; awesome.

,softan,2011-11-22T08:26Z,Well I got my hand on most of the files that wasn't completed fully and added them to the torrent folder but when I rehashe the folder it refuses to hashe the files I added. So it seems I can't upload em to you :(
