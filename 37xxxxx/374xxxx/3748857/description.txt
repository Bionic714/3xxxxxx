This is race number two from the imfamous Bayliss vs. Edwards final championship battle of 2002 World Superbike series.  

This is considered by many to be one of the best superbike races in recent history along with one of the best years of WSBK roadracing overall.

Pardon the cheesy menu for this, what do you expect?  I was just fooling around recording races off the tv via camcorder.

Enjoy!


Race 1 will be uploading in a bit. Stay tuned.
