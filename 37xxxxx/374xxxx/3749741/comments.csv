,Sterling16,2007-07-30T07:02Z,"Wow. I have to say it didn't take the media long to start advertising availability of these pilots, makes me wonder if they were purposely leaked."
,toymangenie,2007-08-21T01:57Z,"Looks like this could be a good series.
The physics is right unlike Terminator 3"
,dukedoit,2007-09-11T09:12Z,A lot of the pilots have been released on DVDs that you can rent at Blockbuster or something.  My sister was talking about it.
,flantastic,2007-09-29T18:15Z,"I love all the terminator movies. This is a welcome addition long overdue. Kudos to the producers and to everyone who worked hard on making this a reality. Good luck with the rest of the series, we look forward to many more awesome episodes.

Every geek ever"
