,assem88,2007-08-05T13:37Z,"tomtomx, lol, that just shows how ignorant u are, if u bothered reading through the rest of the Quran instead of extracting random sentences out of context you would know that Islam has been revealed as a confirmation of what had been revealed to Moses and JEsus (peace be upon them). The people of those two PROPHETS were jews but not jews as we see them today who have rewritten and completely changed the religion to their own benifit just as the people of Jesus Christ (peace be upon him) who call themselves  Christians had! 

Do some research and you will see the perfection of the Quran and Islam :D and Allah willingly you might just accept the truth about reality."
,tomtomx,2007-08-08T00:52Z,Assem88: Actually archelogical findings confirm that the jewish bible hasn't been changed by a single letter for more that 2000 years. Long before mohammed was even born (peace be upon his mullah's victims). Which of course doesn't stop it from containing a lot of outdated nonsense. Just like the quran.

What you state about the Torah may be correct. However, the ""book"" that has superseded the Torah or the Laws of Moses, since the 3rd century A.D. has been the Babylonian Talmud. It was much debated and thoroughly modified by the ""sages"" before it was finally codified. The Talmud is a despicably racist and supremest document. Perhaps you might do a bit of research regarding the Talmud and its importance to Judaism. Then try to defend modern day Zionism which is a direct outgrowth of the sick Talmudic doctrine."
