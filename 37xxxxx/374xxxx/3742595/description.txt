Synopsis: Known mainly as one of Steve McQueens first pictures, the merits of The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery (1959) as a film are rarely mentioned. Like other caper pictures (the Killing and Five Against The House, to name just two), St. Louis traces a crime from its conception to execution. Here, its an actual bank robbery. Real locations are used, and the St. Louis traces a crime from its conception to execution. Here, its an actual bank robbery. Real locations are used, and the St. Louis Police officers that handled the case appear as themselves, creating a tough documentary feel. This was Steve McQueens first real lead, and the mannerisms and coolness we would all come to know can already be seen. Soon, hed move on to Wanted Dead Or Alive. And superstardom.
