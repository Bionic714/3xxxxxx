An Arabian sailor named Sinbad is on a quest to find the legendary Book of Peace, a mysterious artifact that Eris, the Greek goddess of chaos, has framed him for stealing. If he fails on this quest, his childhood friend Prince Proteus of Syracuse will take Sindbad's death penalty. He is accompanied by a motley crew and by the Lady Marina of Thrace, a noble born (also Proteus's fiancee) who becomes very attached to Sinbad. This story takes the name Sinbad, the presence of a Roc, as well as the incident wherein Sinbad and Company encounter an island that turns out to be the back of some great sea-beast from the Arabian Nights; however, much of the setting is derived from Greek mythology, which includes a trip to Tartarus to recover the book and an encounter with the Sirens. The plot of Proteus taking Sinbad's place is similar to the legend of Damon and Pythias.
