From chapter four:

""Harry picked up Hedwig's cage, his Firebolt, and his rucksack, gave his unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look, and then made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall, where he deposited cage, broomstick, and bag near the foot of the stairs.""

Do you guys really think J.K. would write such a complete run-on sentence? This may be an elaborate hoax. You heard it here first."

,dare99,2007-07-21T03:45Z,"Defintly fake if that chapter 4 is anything to go by. The real chapter 4, from the book I've just queued for ages in ASDA for starts, ""Harry ran back upstairs to his bedroom"""
,potter123,2007-07-21T14:59Z,"I just bought the real book and every page i checked was exactly the same as in the book, so this is real"
,dare99,2007-07-21T15:03Z,Liar.
,potter123,2007-07-21T16:42Z,"@dare99: read a few lines past the first ones from chapter four, it really says there: 
""Harry picked up Hedwig's cage, his Firebolt, and his rucksack, gave his unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look, and then made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall, where he deposited cage, broomstick, and bag near the foot of the stairs."""
,dare99,2007-07-21T17:01Z,"Actually downloaded it and had a look. I stand corrected, it looks legit.

Sorry."
,Sly_G,2007-07-21T17:05Z,It's REAL.
,bmswlfc90,2007-07-21T18:32Z,"yer its real, ive checked the first few lines and the last few lines and its all good but buy it if u want it, its lyk 6 quid lol!"
,govnuk,2007-07-26T18:57Z,"(Not a spoiler)

?I?m sorry, I?m sorry!? Hermione cried as Harry wrenched the book from Ron?s leg and retied it _shit._

Sixth chapter. Now, would they(Warners, or whatever) really release the bock with such an obvious misstake in it? Or was the error done uring the transformation actual book>doc.?"
,piratedawg,2007-08-01T05:54Z,Yeah..I find this version is corrupted starting in Chapter 13. It is the real thing though.
