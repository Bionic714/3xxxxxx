,patankumar,2007-09-29T08:19Z,"I do also have the same problem.  
I am able to load the setup menu.  But after I click Install, nothing happens.  

What is this?  Any help guys.  "
,blackcurtain,2007-09-29T10:20Z,"try this,
works for XP with other iso's and security software that stops burning.

1.get/update daemon tools to v4.10
2. while at daemon website go to link ""3rd party add ons for v4-series""  and down YASU v1.2(cloaks(hides) the mounted image from secuROM 7.x and safedisc 4.x this way the security thinks it's actually a real disc not an image)
3. install deamon, mount image
4. run YASU (each windows session, must rerun after reboot)
5. install/play game

haven't tried this with vista yet so not sure if it will work but Daemon v4.10 supports vista and this process works great for other games that are protected with securom or safedisc. 

I will be trying it myself as soon as torrent is done and will check back to say weather it works.

,darkness666777,2007-10-20T07:28Z,i think ive seen a patch for halo 2 to use it on xp by razor..there are also some videos on youtube just search halo2 on xp and a lot of people post videos..btw does this file^ really work...i got vista but i mean is it the full game?
,Sketchbag,2007-10-20T08:48Z,I would like to know if this is actually going to allow me to play the full game on vista ..or will it just mess up after the first lvl like so many people say
,Sketchbag,2007-10-20T08:52Z,If you have it on Xbox Try XBC Just search Xbconnect on google It allows you to connect to your computer using the systemlink option in the game and then connects you to other people across the world ...in other words free xbox live but better

,xxshady,2008-01-27T05:21Z,Does multiplayer work in this torrent? Because I want to play this game online (since i have a gold account)
,pwn247,2008-02-01T22:39Z,"Guys, this is obviously a busted torrent, and not worth the download at the moment. Please stop posting comments like ""plz help!"" because no one has helped anyone yet- and the chances that you personally are going to get help are slim to none. And posting ""email help to ____"" is an epic fail in itself. 

Just avoid this torrent for now."
,matthijs57,2008-03-31T21:25Z,"don't bother to download, the game quality is bad. and you only can play the first lvl."
,chikit134,2008-04-04T15:31Z,sure you can just play 1 level but there is another carck for it that activates the whole game
,koora888,2008-04-16T05:12Z,"do i have to install it in the default location ?

,aswqaasxza001,2008-07-06T23:12Z,"The setup and crack are fine.
The only thing wrong is startup.exe.
Heres the link to a fixed one (1.6mb only)

just copy setup files on pc replace the existing startup.exe with the one above.
