,zeddy911,2007-07-22T13:05Z,"Fake... Nobody have managed to make a stable DX10 for XP, and prolly wont... DX10 is spesially made for Vista.."
,Angelico_Payne,2007-07-24T09:01Z,Tanx for warning
,HIS_X,2007-08-02T10:21Z,"1). Nobody have managed to make a stable DX10 for XP? Use Google and search for Alky Project...dumbass (Try to do more Research next time) -

2). It stays on 99.9, Well maby cuz there was bad seeding!? Becuz i have downloaded it and tried it and it works... -

3). You dumbshit, You cant download DX10 for XP from MS homepage stuped? MS is only gonna release DX10 on Vista, And Xp computers can't install the Vista version... "
,darkmdbeener,2007-08-29T06:58Z,it works worth the download lot faster then that fuckin microshit download
,KillAWatt_1705,2007-10-10T22:53Z,"The download doesn't seem to be working for me. I try to switch to the DirectX 10 feature in Bioshock though the option is blanked out completely.

Can someone please elaborate? I'm perpexed at how this is supposed to work."
,AMIRZ,2007-11-01T19:26Z,hey it just a fucking dx 9 redistributable pack comes with useless crack. even  i have newer dx 9.0c. don't download or u waste your time and bandwidth. i agree with opinion about wait for official dx 10 patch for xp from alky project (falling leaf). alky patches almost all vista app running in xp like games n sidebar.alpha library for xp has been released and it's worked. keep on watching for future update.  or anybody has another information?pardon my bad english
,omghaxzs,2007-11-27T02:00Z,"The alky project is just some guys project for reverse engineering DX10. He's not even using DX API, he's using OpenGL"
,gamer4ever,2007-12-05T22:55Z,"doesnt work, i recommend partitioning ur drive and allocating like 25-50 gigs to install vista lite, i recommend the amit talkin release. then just install the REAL directx 10 and use vista to run games.
i know vista sucks but if u want to play ur games its easiest to do this.... *_*"

,aerostar757,2008-03-26T01:21Z,"You've got to be kidding, the only way to have DX10 is with Vista. XP is so different from Vista, that making it compatible with DX10 would be a waste of time and money for Microsoft when they should be working on Os's that aren't 7 years old. Before you call microsoft money hungry, remember that office 07, IE7 were originally slated to be Vista only, and that they were going to charge you$$$ for XP SP2. They have to draw the line somewhere..."
,ImPrettyMuchSexy,2008-05-01T19:45Z,Works
,feedbacker,2008-05-30T09:09Z,"This is fake, it does install something and our comp slows down.

,TranceDude,2008-09-19T14:20Z,"The cracked Direct X 10 (for Win XP) works perfectly! Yes Microsoft only made it for Vista, but be glad theres some good cracker's? out there:)"
,Vorperblad,2008-11-17T14:32Z,"Ok Well I don't know about the comments I read, they can be detracting sometimes.

My Toshiba Sat-pro. has a GMA x3100 graphics chipset. Although the update seemed to be Directx9c, I CAN now see Binoculars on the Silent Hunter 3 crew. The vertex shaders are WORKING.
I Update the latest Mobile Intel(R) GM965 Express Chipset, and with the DirectX10 (for XP) IT WORKED!!!

MicroSux doesn't care nor do they officially support XP anymore, but Clubpulse does, as do many modders and programmers out there. Thanx to them. Good support. If it don't work for U, don't whine about it. Be thankful that at least someone TRIED to help. 
;)"
,BoobyFace,2008-11-21T07:21Z,"Ok, here's the final word

There are enough seeders to get 100% of this file with no difficulties at all.

This file works perfectly for my XP system.

There is nothing at all wrong with this file!!!!!!"
,Scott_T,2008-12-30T03:36Z,I was just at the alky project webpage and they were closing it up cause they couldnt get it to work
,jaju123,2009-04-16T17:39Z,"Ok, you still have to have a DirectX 10 graphics card for it to work.

,bridog80,2010-03-26T20:14Z,"@Unknown1110111: LOL! Direct X10 is built into Windows 7. Dude what does the title for this torrent say? Read it a couple times out load.

,Nemo837,2010-11-24T22:22Z,Very very fast download and it works :D
,SJCarline,2011-01-31T05:02Z,I havn't tried any games to see if it actually worked but i did install it then ran dxdiag to check version and it was still version 9.0c. I would seriously get down on my knees for the man who did get dx10 on xp to work tho....it was worth a try
,Daikataro,2011-07-13T18:07Z,"FAKE FAKE FAKE

Before installing my dxdiag tool showed my current DX version as 9.0c

After installing my dxdiag tool STILL shows my current version as 9.0c

""Can you run it?"" site diagnosis tool also shows my version as 9.0c

This one's a total FAKE, i don't dobt there's a good encoder out there who's working on a DX10 version for windows XP, but this one is NOT it, WASTED BANDWIDTH"
,begwande,2012-01-11T15:57Z,"This is a real deal guys.
Thanks uploader."
,nemephis,2012-01-12T20:21Z,"FAKE

,ashishrane,2012-03-12T07:57Z,"Total Fake, plz dont dowload by mistake also.  After installing this and rebooting pc still shows 9.0c directx.  Total waste of bandwith.:("
,ashishrane,2012-03-12T08:04Z,use this one instead http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4509187/Direct_X_10_For_Win_XP. It shows dx10 in dxdiag. It is dx10 cracked by russians.  I tried it myself. U can check by typing dxdiag.  Hope it helps.
