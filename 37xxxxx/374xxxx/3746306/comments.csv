Anyways guys, I tried burning this with Nero, under the DVD video option, tried to burn -  Nero says something about invalid  video files... So I click burn anyway, and it says that my DVD+R is not big enough. So I quit out of that and went to  Nero Recode > ""Recode and entire DVD to DVD"". I go through the wizard and choose the VIDEO_TS dir, everything looks good, so I choose burn. It takes a hour to burn instead of 20mins., but at least it burns with Nero that way. I'm thinking the other torrents are probably that way too... But I haven't DLed them yet...

P.S. Even though the torrent title seems to be in Spanish, these are the English release (You can set the audio to Spanish). "
