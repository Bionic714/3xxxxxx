1. Image resulution is not HDTV, it looks rather like PAL upsampled to HDTV resolution. It might still be a little bit better than DVD, but not too much;
2. If you haven't got this from the description (I haven't :), the movie is in Japanese with no subtitles."

Unfortunately the image quality on the DVD is, in fact, worse than in this HD. But the DVD has subtitles. Alas, can't have it all :)"
