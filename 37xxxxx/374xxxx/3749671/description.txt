Drunken Swordsman aka The Idiot Swordsman (1979)

Reviewer: Andrew Saroch

The heroic 'Drunken Knight' was once famed for his chivalry and interest in those seeking justice, but suddenly he disappears from the martial world without leaving any clues as to his identity. Years later, a cocky oaf blunders his way to victory against a team of local bandits and is suddenly championed by villagers as the much-missed 'Drunken Knight'. Despite being hopelessly out of his depth and in no way capable of living up to the name, he is secretly aided by a talented swordswoman who has a crush on him and dispatches the foes expertly enough for the pretence to continue. The so-called 'Drunken Knight' is also followed by an adoring student who seems to be hiding his own interesting identity and the team now venture out into the wilderness to take on fearsome warlords.
