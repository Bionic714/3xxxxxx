To the best of my knowledge, there has been no Wing Commander 4 soundtrack CD released, and I could not find these files anywhere online, so I ripped all the relevant in-game music (and the intro music) from the game TRE files.

I will probably get the music from Wing Commander Prophecy up here in future.

Please enjoy the music from this classic game!
