Overview:	The Shaolin temple is being slaughtered by a ruthless lord. Around the continent a series of martial artists trained in Shaolin await their chance meetings to help re-build the Shaolin temple and overthrow the lord. One loyal student sets out, meets up with another, and so on.. Eventually the team sets out to help a scholar (portrayed by Woo) with a special map get to shelter. This is a period kung fu movie with not much of a plot. The fighting is good and there's lots of it.
