Pack 03- 40 .MIS .JPG for your Movies(better than .NFO)

This a collection of 40 .MIS and .JPG(poster) for movies

I will keep packs short: No 250 movies like Pack 01

95% of the time, I create a .MIS for a movie in 2 clicks
within Windows Explorer. I get the information and the 
movie poster. IMDB.COM might not have a picture/description
and I need to "hunt" one down. Most of the time, I go to 
Amazon, DVDEmpire or official movie site.

Note:
I often removed the group name.(I won't for future pack)
I will use the folder name and not the short name in the RAR.
I add the year unlike certain group :(

1-i2mwordremove.txt rename it to i2mwordremove.txt. It's 
was to make it simpler to select with your torrent client.


Also, select 1-readme.txt for more information(2 CD, 
short name)

******************************************************
MIS Info Video is free (parental control, resume
playback, chapters...). Perfect if you want to block 
access to a 6 year to your movies(horror, action, pr0n).

It's a front end/player. but If you don't like the 
internal player, you can configure your own player.

Info2MIS is free. It's the app's that I used to create 
the .MIS. It can also extract information from imdb.com
(with picture), tv.com, amazon.com(with picture), 
dvdempire.com (with picture) ....

Took me a few seconds with an episode on tv.com(find page)
and only 2 clicks for a movie from imdb.com(with picture)

Major update: 2007-05-01 (work with Info2MIS v2.0.0b12+) 
"Building Torrent Descriptions Made Easy with bbcode.txt":
I have made a tutorial for a private site. With this, you
can create a proper description that the admins will like.
They hate, and users too, when the description is frankly 
too small. I have seen just the file name in a NFO with
no codec info or plot... Use this instead. :D 
You can copy it to other forum but [code] may not be 
supported.
