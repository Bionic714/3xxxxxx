,Painter21,2007-07-17T03:10Z,"Boy, that sucks!"
,AutumnDreamer,2007-07-18T11:04Z,I couldn't get this to work as anything but a free version.  
,Syph1x,2007-07-24T20:37Z,"nborlum, Ad-Aware Free and Pro share the same install file, so I think you gotta install it as free first, and then drag the cracks into the installation dir. Atleast I think so. Anyway, good upload."
,Thunderace,2007-07-26T19:49Z,To get PRO. Do what jonte_mayer say and also rember to uncheck the install folder in the custom scan settings. Otherwise it will remove the crack file an make it just free

It is the pro version.To run Ad Watch just copie the crack ( Ad Watch given in the torrent ) and replace it with the old one and open it."
,slaskkonto,2007-07-27T15:56Z,last version is 7.0.1.6
,HeloMaXX_8,2007-07-31T04:52Z,"Worked perfect - dragged the cracked files over to the install folder. Renamed the files that were in there, just added old.exe to the end. Opened it up and selected custom scan and checked all and then uncheck the lavasoft folder. Worked for me, I hope that it works for you. "
,joonaukkonen,2007-07-31T09:47Z,"works great!
after installation just copy-paste the cracks included in the torrent and overwrite the old exe-files in the installation directory. now you have the pro version and everything - including ad-watch - works.
theres only one problem. when you have the cracked files in the directory the programs telling you theyre the old version and asks you whether youd like to update them. answer no. if you try to update the software it overwrites the cracks and you end up with the free version.
you can however update the definition file which is key to ad-awares functionality and your safety.
i only hope someone cracks the possible upcoming sofware updates."
,kazooz,2007-08-05T18:51Z,Tested with Vista. And scanned by NOD32. The crack fully working and its virus free. Remember to DONT use update when you use this crack.
,slippiefist,2007-09-11T01:23Z,@psxgamepro: Maybe you should just buy the damn program.
,ascari_nations,2008-10-18T18:39Z,golan u liar. Its the free version and i found a genesisA virus
