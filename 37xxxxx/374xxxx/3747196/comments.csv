Use Foobar2000 /www.foobar2000.org/ if you experience any problems playing the .CUE files.
IT's FREE and OPEN SOURCE! /Hooray/

If you want to see the tracks as listed above, you must enique the .CUE files instead of the .MP3 files.

Every single album is ONE .MP3 file with all tracks in it."

But how to convert from 1 big MP3 to 1 MP3 per song? 

Thanks"
,DAITHEFLU,2007-09-22T07:52Z,"Use Foobar to reencode the tracks. 
This will split them to single files.

Or you can google for some app. for this stuff. 
There are tons, but i don't use them..
CuZ FOOBAR is all you need :)

Cheers."
