Credits to FEFE2003 for the source mp3s.


I found Thunderdome 2007 on TPB but regretfully with no .CUE files (this is for proper titles in foobar2000 and mp3cue in WinAmp.

And ofcourse, this will not do for such a pedantic little asshole like me, so I am now reseeding with my selfwritten cuefiles. The artists and titles are 100% accurate. However...

Remember that the timeline isnt millisecond accurate since I had to use my head to calculate each tracks position in the mp3 using only tracklength information gathered from http://www.discogs.com/release/982065

This is better than nothing at all, right? ;D

Oh, and also, for those of you that have allready downloaded FEFE2003's torrent, you can select only the cuefiles and save them in the same directory as the mp3s.

REMEMBER TO OPEN THE CUEFILES IN NOTEPAD AND CHECK TO SEE THAT IT HAS THE CORRECT MP3 FILENAMES! If you have in anyway altered the filename of your Thunderdome 2007 mp3s then you must alter the cuefiles to match these accordingly.

Now no more whining, Bakkerszoon... =)

Enjoy.
