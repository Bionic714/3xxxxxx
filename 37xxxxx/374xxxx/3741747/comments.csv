So unless you have a lot of time to waste trying to get these to work I would suggest downloading from a different ripper.

The logic of this guy eludes me. Why share files that very few people seem to be able to play.

I would advise downloading from a different ripper. It will save you a lot of bandwidth and a whole lot of hassle. Prolific he may be, but quantity is no substitute for quality."

Haali Media Splitter

ffdshow (for audio codec, as PowerDVD Ultras audio codecs cannot be used inside of Vista Media Center)

PowerDVD Ultra 7.3 (for video codecs)

Vista Media Center frontend (Windows Media Player 11)

Perfect playback...Have downloaded 15 releases (blu-ray and hd-dvd) from HDTV CHINA.

PowerDVD Ultra gives me hardware decoding inside Vista Media Center (for nvidia 8500, 8600, ati 2400, ati 2600). If you own another card just use ffdshow for video decoding.

Download TSSplitter and you can join all files into one big .ts. I hope they keep releasing titles in this fashion."

First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.


Install those and report back!
