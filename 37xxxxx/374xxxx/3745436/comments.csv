,DiAKRiTiKOS,2007-07-21T02:40Z,"Thanks for this, but Not in english and no subs, least with MPC"
,HMarsden,2007-07-25T18:39Z,"Excellent quality, full screen theater style DVD. And if you paid attention to the dvd then you would have noticed that it is in english, simply go to audio setup and select english. Would like to see this person doing more flicks. Best quality yet. And the movie and story where very accurate and well acted."
,HMarsden,2007-07-25T18:41Z,"Recommend using Nero showtime, it allows you to change you audio and also turn on english or spanish subtitles. Nez nice Job."
