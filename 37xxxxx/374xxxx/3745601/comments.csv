,hurrafor,2007-07-19T16:15Z,"ABSOLUTELY works....you just have to do a little digging:

First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.


Install those and report back!

KMPlayer to play HD from HDTV CHINA

If you download those 3 and install them all downloads from HDTV CHINA will work Have downloaded 40 and all works"

tv for free?"
,DolphWulff,2008-06-21T01:18Z,"WTF... This definitely doesn't look like HDDVD... Is this mislabelled? First of all, the picture is extremely grainy, second of all this is 16:9 aspect ratio, the film is 2.35:1. So this has been cropped. I don't think they'd do that on an HDDVD?"
,S.T.A.L.L.K.E.R.,2008-08-23T19:22Z,I wonder where is the Seed .........!?!
,S.T.A.L.L.K.E.R.,2008-08-24T11:02Z,"And the fact that the picture is rash, that's OK......?"
,weezl,2009-02-13T12:51Z,"to play:
good enough comp
uninstall all crap codecs
install cccp

however, i'm very much questioning the quality of this...
the bottom ~8 pixel rows are distorted and frequently show artifacts
picture is oversharpened
framerate is 30, not 24
stream info says interlaced (though i don't notice any line artifacts)

the opening scenes are also supposed to be insultingly inaccurate"
