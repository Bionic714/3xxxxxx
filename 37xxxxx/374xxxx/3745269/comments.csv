The bits with 'de' cutting himself into the film eighteen years later is a real treat. If I ever get to 100% I will be quite happy to seed this -- and any another de Antonio films anyone might be able to upload. Loved Point of Order and In the Year of the Pig, am *dying* to see Rush to Judgement, Millhouse, Underground, Mr. Hoover and I...anything by de Antonio! Thanks."
