Thanks for your help."
,3aMoN,2008-05-30T16:47Z,".nrg files are nero's disc image format, but you can use any virtual drive such as daemon tools.
just mount and play, you can also mount both cds at once so you dont need to change discs:D"

,sic_bish,2010-03-12T13:24Z,"has anyone run on win7? i just tried but it seems to run super fast, i tried reducing the fps but it just makes it glitchy and fast :P and suggestions???  "
,motley666,2010-06-21T21:00Z,"Thanks for this, it works fine. If it runs superfast to some of you, do the following: ctrl+alt+del while in the menu, go to indy.exe in the task manager and right click, then set affinity, disable the one processor if you have two, or the three if you have four and press ok. Return to the game and it runs in a normal speed."
