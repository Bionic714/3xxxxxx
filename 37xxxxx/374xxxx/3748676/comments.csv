,loymo,2007-10-30T22:57Z,this should work using dosbox
,loymo,2007-10-30T22:58Z,ima gonna give it a go ill let u know
,loymo,2007-10-31T04:01Z,ok heres what i did i got iso tools and daemon tools then i downloaded the game for some reason the only place i could see the game once complete was in iso tools itself i the mounted it throuh deamon tools and it works fine. the only problem is it quits after every mission but at least it saves your game.   this is a classic game and well worth it cheers soviet
,SovietGenius,2008-03-31T04:19Z,"You shouldn't need DosBox to run the game because it was made for Win 9x. The game works in XP, but it does crash after every mission. Try setting it to Windows 95 or 98 compatibility mode to see if that fixes it (sorry I can't test it right now, don't have the game installed)"

You should have the one from MarcACE; He hexed de exe-file, so it works in XP without the ending."
