,PeakOil,2007-07-17T11:24Z,"This is in my opinion the best Peak Oil documentary. 
Peak Oil will be THE topic in the near future. 
US oil production peaked as predicted early 70s.
Nort Sea has peaked and production rates are declining. 
Cantarell (Mexico) peaked and is in rapid decline. 
Saudi production is down 8% the last year. 
With continued increasing demand and flat to falling supply (and expected rapid fall in a couple of years), this spells BIG TROUBLE. 
Watch the show and see what the oil geologists and other oil industry insiders have to say. 

Is Peak Oil a possible reason for 911 (justification for war on terror) and invasion of Iraq and next possibly Iran ???
I bet it is. This is US last chance to secure energy supplies for the coming decade."
,moreinfo,2007-07-18T22:09Z,Are we really running low on oil reserves ? I dont know. But if you take the time to read this document written around 1905 some of these films might fall into place like the pieces of a 2500 year old puzzle. I found it very entertaining to say the least. http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/illuminatiprotocols.htm

,Warsie,2008-03-11T04:40Z,"um..the protocols of the Elders of Zion was proven to be fake though. Not saying Zionists ""are the best people out there"" though.

But yeah the Oil Peak is happening and we're fucked!"
