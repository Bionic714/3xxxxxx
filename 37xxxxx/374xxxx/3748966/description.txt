Date Published: 2004

Synopsys:

This book is about BGP, from the basics of the BGP protocol itself to information on deploying BGP in networks stretching from small and simple to very large and extremely complex. The authors begin with an overview of the BGP protocol itself in Chapter 1. Then move into various deployment situations, starting with small enterprise networks using BGP internally and to connect to the Internet. From there, they continue to move through ever-larger scale deployments of BGP, discussing how BGP and its extensive policy mechanisms fit into network architectures. The authors continue by providing details about finely tuning BGP to perform optimally and scale effectively in an array of deployment scenarios. The book finishes with in-depth discussions on debugging and troubleshooting various problems within the protocol and BGP networks. ***This is the only book designed to show how to deploy BGP in a wide variety of networks. Every other book discusses how BGP operates, but not how to use it in a real-world network, with all the tradeoffs and capabilities discussed.
