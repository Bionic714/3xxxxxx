,ifihadtime,2007-07-20T10:12Z,"could'nt change the skins, any idea's, appart from that all working 100%"
,sorceror,2007-07-20T18:50Z,"@ifihadtime

Skins should Change automatically on install, (there is an option to get it done that way) if not make sure that you install the skin to the proper directory and use the following;

Right click on the player >Dialogs > Skin Selector > choose the relevant skin for the relevant mode > apply

Hope this helps......Keep me updated"
,BanjoHacket,2007-07-25T20:41Z,"Hey! thanks for upload. this is a very good player for almost everything, but i really miss support for DVD. someone know if there is a way to put in a codec for mpeg4???"
,BanjoHacket,2007-07-25T21:42Z,I assume this is the trial version?
,sorceror,2007-07-26T04:02Z,"@benjohacket

No its not the trial version, why assume things when its said in plain english that its Zoomplayer WMV professional (CRACKED), and since you say this is a good player and all Iam happy yet its kinda better if you actually knew what you were talking about since this is a Multimedia player that has a seperate MODE FOR DVD......and i aint bothered to include a user manual for the dumb dweebs who cant get a media player to work and since the question is there as to whether you can install a Mpeg codec....i suppose you thought that the K-lite mega codec pack was a internet games pack or something, that i inlcluded for fun.....geez what a lamer

,xiIix,2007-12-29T06:33Z,"I've been using this player for years and years now. It's the only player I'll use. I've tried others, and for a time, VLC was better for playing all types of video without fail (as a last resort type of thing), but now Zoomplayer has a built in updater that fires up right at installation, which is awesome. This will play ANYTHING, and play it well. FFDshow is the shit, you can tweak the way your movies look till the cows come home. I've tried other players and I always, always end up going back to Zoomplayer. It's just the best damn player there is for Windows. 

If you don't have the updater you can download the trial from the site and then use the updater from that."

,RenayT,2009-07-25T00:44Z,"ZP installed clean; everything worked. I didn't use the codec pack (just let ZP's install center do its thing) or the skins - I've stuck with ultra-minimalist by Blight for years.
Thanks."
