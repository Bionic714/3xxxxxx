PHP, Apache, and MySQL are all part of the open source group of software programs. The open source
movement is a collaboration of some of the finest minds in computer programming. By allowing the
open exchange of information, programmers from all over the world contribute to make a truly powerful
and efficient piece of software available to everyone. Through the contributions of many people to
the publicly available source code, bugs get fixed, improvements are made, and a good software program
becomes a great one over time.
