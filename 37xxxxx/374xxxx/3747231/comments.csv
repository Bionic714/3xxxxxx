This is an album by Nobuo Uematsu, the same guy who composed the music for the Final Fantasy games. It's just a solo album of his, but from what I hear it's just as good as any of his other work.
Thanks again, I'd really like to hear it before I pay $50 (shipping not included) at Amazon.com for the real thing. Why isn't all of Uematsu's work on the top lists at any local record store? >_>"
