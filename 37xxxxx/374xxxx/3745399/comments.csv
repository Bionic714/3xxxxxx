,Zooperman,2008-05-25T04:29Z,"Pro: Thank you for the upload, it's people like you that keep music like this alive and well.

Con: 1st 2 songs to me sounded over produced, and the bass muffled much of the instrumentation. as if in conversion, the bass setting was a tad too high.  Just my opinion (see pro above before flaming)

Bitrate is adequate, and beyond the 1st two songs, album is quite enjoyable, and brings back memories of the late 70's (smooooooke on the water!)

Thanks again."
,css.cheater,2008-07-24T01:50Z,"This torrent has been kept alive for more than a year now. Thanks to all the seeders.

BTW, there is no sound tempering in the conversion as Zooperman might have thought. I have the original CD and had the original double EP. Beleave me, this is the way it's supposed to sound. It's supposed to get your furniture moving, if you listen to it the wright way."
,crlcan81,2008-10-02T14:58Z,"I downloaded this so called soundtrack. Who do you think you're fooling? I'm running ubuntu, loaded the first song, and it actually SKIPPED the first 5 6 seconds of the song. This has NEVER happened on any songs I've done myself. How dare you place such a horrible copy of such a fine piece of music as this."
,css.cheater,2008-10-11T00:01Z,"I guess you're the only one I'm fooling, as you say. Don't take it personal, but I made sure you couldn't get the same copy as everybody else. It's not that I don't like you but... Oh! Wait! Yes! It is because I don't like you!

You should try to download it again or try another OS. Use your brains a little... ;)"
,xendependant,2008-11-24T00:34Z,Kenny's trip to track 6 is absolutely classic
