Uh, let's see, you would have to:

A) write the fake book, including table of contents, endpages, copyright notice, etc.;
B) have it formatted and art designed to match the series;
C) Have it printed;
D) Have it bound; and,
E) Have someone digitally photograph every damn page.

It's too much damn work for a fake. Someone photographing a pre-release copy makes *much* more sense.

,tyrerbanks,2007-07-19T08:27Z,"SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT

quick, possibly very important question here.

in chapter sixteen, harry sees the tombstones of his parents and it seems to say that they died in 1981.  this would put james at 21 years old (it says he was born in 1960) and lilly at 18 (1963) at the time of their deaths, which is certainly a lot younger than i thought they were supposed to be.

at first, i thought that since each book is about one year and it takes about 1.5-2 to put each one out, that the dates just seemed wrong because harry isn't in the year 2007 - but then i remembered that harry had never been ""older"" than me, especially not by 5-6 years. (edit: i guess he ""is"", now that i check wikipedia.  oops.)

so....despite truly believing this is the real thing - have we found ourselves a flub?"

That link is FAKE. This was originally stemmed from a post by a GameFAQS troll; I know because I was there to watch the hilarity ensue. He got the chapter titles right but he's still posting the false information about the deaths-- this page was put up shortly after he was banned.

To all the noobs: 'scar' is not the last word. This was announced a while back. Get with teh program.

Lastly, YES, this book is the real deal. I read the first couple chapters, the epilogue (which was leaked much earlier) and a few sections pertaining to my favorite character. 

Be resourcfeul and google a few keywords if you want to know who actually dies: there are plenty of reliable sources confirming what's said in this book. Otherwise, wait a few minutes for the download though I'll be waiting for the 21st to read the whole thing rather than straining to see a lot of this text.

ok, so in chapter 16, there is a part that shows the dates of harry's parents births and deaths - but it's not right.  it says that harry's father was 21 (1960-19810 and mother was 18 (1963-1981) when they DIED, meaning they were about 20 and 17 when he was BORN - which is just completely not correct.  i may not be as into harry potter as many, but i'm pretty sure they were supposed to have been the same grade - since they fell in love in their 7th year - and that they were much older than 20/17 when harry was born.

so, my question is, how did this get messed up?  they didn't really print this flub, did they?  i had been 100% sure this was the real thing before i saw this...now i'm only 99% sure haha.

Thanks for the upload! I am downloading it now, the book should come to me in a day but nothing wrong with reading it twice."

,Minerva.TheGift,2007-11-14T22:10Z,"Thanks for the Torrent! This one is a .pdf of a bunch of pictures taken of the book, hence the fairly large file size.  It's a bit tricky to read in some spots, but it truly is the 7th HP book.
