So unless you have a lot of time to waste trying to get these to work I would suggest downloading from a different ripper.

The logic of this guy eludes me. Why share files that very few people seem to be able to play.

I would advise downloading from a different ripper. It will save you a lot of bandwidth and a whole lot of hassle. Prolific he may be, but quantity is no substitute for quality."

H264/VC-1 in mpeg2 transport streams? i think its not so nice as matroska, but it DOES work.

i also find that its abit ugly how he includes multiple audio tracks..

but questioning if the files work? stupid, they do.

I think you need to look at the typically stupid winblows user to find whats wrong."

,kokousic,2008-08-22T19:50Z,ZOOM PLAYER can handle VC-1 easily.
,onislayer1,2009-01-22T18:28Z,I have yet to have issues playing this guys or anyone's VC1 files. The quality is also superior to just about naything else. Anyways I am at 95% need a seeeeedddddd.
,onislayer1,2009-01-31T22:24Z,"china, finish this seed please and then i will continue seeding. stuck at 94.5%. please anyone."
,weezl,2009-02-08T23:50Z,"NOTHING wrong with this upload, worked perfectly when i watched it!
