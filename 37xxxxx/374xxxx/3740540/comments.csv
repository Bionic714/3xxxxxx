Two quick things: 
you can't say it is ""better"". The release you recommend /seems/ to be a RIP, whereas mine is *not*.

Secondly, if by ""better"" you mean faster, then worry not potential leechers out there for there are over 20 copies available in my swarm (over 19 seeders, 104 leechers and growing!) Trouble is TPB's tracker doesn't account for other external tracker's statistics, which means my torrent's main tracker's stats are left out, hence the low seeders & leechers..."

What won't?"
,0v3rloader,2007-07-15T11:58Z,"To everybody:

There seems to be a trojan in files ""Install.exe"" and ""KaSTro5.exe""! Do not run these executables under any circumstances and rather unpack the game and run file ""~UnPack~.bat"" to install the game."
,Smot_Poker,2007-07-23T21:51Z,blacllists version doesn't work on my comp. the game just crashes to desktop and i can't patch it to the newest version.  Hoping I can patch this version Anybody know? dont want to download the whole thing again for nothing... especialy considering my virus checker is crapping up my download and making it take forever
,Smot_Poker,2007-07-25T04:50Z,poo :(
,dtcmusic,2007-08-02T15:27Z,Avg found trojan so i just deleted it all
,_-jansson-_,2007-08-15T18:46Z,wery god download inspite of the trojan
,monstermig,2007-09-08T00:06Z,An easy way to avoid the trojan is by using the Âľtorrent then you can download it without those trojan infected files
,SDThielking,2007-10-14T21:30Z,"AOP-CT.r24 is corrupted and unreadable.
That means the whole download is worthless, yes?"
,SDThielking,2007-10-15T14:54Z,"All right, re-downloaded .r24, wrestled Vista for a bit to get it to insert it in proper order, and found ANOTHER corrupted file - .r44

Must have just been a bad day for bittorrent, I guess. Going through and repairing files one by one, if I get it running I'll put it up."
,SDThielking,2007-10-15T15:16Z,"Nope, .r44 is still corrupt after three downloads. Look like this torrent's useless."
,Elpunto,2008-10-20T14:39Z,"Hello, i ran the unpack file so i guess the game installed automaticly. 

but i have a problem when i press engine to play the game i only get as far as the loading screen before the game suddenly stops and an microsoft message comes up and closes the game.

What should i do?"
[V],gansuk,2009-04-09T23:12Z,can anybody reseed this? i dont have any kaos rips this early on.
