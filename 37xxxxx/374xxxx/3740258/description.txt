Plot Summary

The wonders of computer animation bring Barbie to life as she takes on the role of Clara in Tchaikovsky's "The Nutcracker," only the plot manages to take on a strange life of its own, deviating heavily from the ballet. Clara visits relatives for Christmas and is presented with a gift of a nutcracker, which her young cousin manages to break. After the family heads off to bed, with Clara taking the sofa for the night, things get out of hand. The Mouse King, voiced by Tim Curry (Clue, The Rocky Horror Picture Show), invades the home and tries to take the Nutcracker into captivity. A fight ensues and Clara is shrunk to mouse size. Once the invading mice are thwarted, Clara learns that only the Sugarplum Princess can revert her to her natural size, and she and Nutcracker set off on a grand adventure to find the fabled princess.

Releasers Notes
