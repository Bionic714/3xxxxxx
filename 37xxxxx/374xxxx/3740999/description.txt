See file-list for details. 

The name Savak refers to the secret police in Iran during the regime of the (American sponsored) Shah (until 1979). The title ┬┤Four Hundred Forty Four Days┬┤ refers to the number of days the heroic muhajedin kept the infidel Americans hostage at their embassy in Tehran. This CD is based on a/m concept.

More on Savak to be found on MySpace under Savak.

Download, listen, seed and, if you like it, consider purchasing the original. It is worth it (IMHO).

Enjoy!
