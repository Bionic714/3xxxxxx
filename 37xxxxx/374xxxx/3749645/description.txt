Rendez-vous with Death (1980) - REMASTERED

Avg. Rating:  	
  3.8 / 5 (based on 3 ratings).

Plot:	This soulful, powerful, intelligent, and beautifully-made martial arts epic about a master swordsman protecting a treasure chest on a dangerous journey stands beside "The Deadly Breaking Sword" and "The Kung Fu Instructor" as one of the director's best.

Overview:	Sun Chung had been recognized as an expert comedy and crime thriller director, but he was to gain even greater acclaim for his soulful, powerful, intelligent, and beautifully-made martial arts epics. This stands alongside "The Deadly Breaking Sword" and "The Kung Fu Instructor" as one of his very best. It's not so much the plot--a master swordsman protects a treasure chest on a dangerous journey--that makes this great, but what Sun does with it, inspiring the cast and crew to some of their finest work.
