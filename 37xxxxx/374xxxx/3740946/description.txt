Imprisoning a group of people in a living hell of darkness and death the Puppetmaster controls the fate of each one. One by one, the captives awake in agonizing pain - some are slightly injured, others are fatally wounded. The survivors are also mentally tortured by the unseen villain, who demands that there can be only one winner at this game

Drawn in by curiosity, the unfortunate souls who fall into the Puppetmaster's diabolical trap of perpetual darkness.
