,sub5,2007-07-25T12:50Z,"hey wcao thanks for the up, but the audio file seems to be protected and wont play or burn, any ideas to help me out, cheers in advance"
,upl8tr,2007-07-26T02:32Z,"Finally got it downloaded;-) 

Thanks  wcao, however, sub5 is right about the music cd's.

It seems that when you ripped them you had the protection switched on,

 (according to the M$ site that you are automatically connected to as soon as you try to play the files) in order to download the media usage rights! 

See below-
**************************************
 A license is required to play this file
The file you are trying to play was ripped (copied) from an audio CD.

During the ripping process, the file was ""protected."" 

This limits the number of computers on which the file can be played.

To play the file on this computer, you must download a license (a process known as ""license migration""). A license acts an electronic key that allows you to ""unlock"" a protected file and play it.

To download a license for this file, click Download License.
Notes:
Microsoft keeps track of the number of license migrations that have been performed for this content. Microsoft does not collect any contact information (such as your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address) to perform the migration. For more information about the information that is sent to Microsoft, see the Privacy Statement.
For more information about protected files and license migration, see the Windows Media Player FAQ page.

I've been to the site and had a read, basically if you have the time/inclination, all you have to do is rip both of the cd's again with the protection off and upload just those disks, - Sorted!!

Good work with the rest of the upload tho, really good prog and the manual prints off just fine:-)"
,wCao,2007-07-27T22:08Z,"thing is i don't have the licenses either, since this isn't originally mine but rather a friend's. i'll see to getting the riped cd's as fast as i can though. sorry."
,upl8tr,2007-07-29T20:15Z,"Hi wcao, 

Cheers mate, that'll be great if you can, and by the way, there's absolutely no need to apologise!

You can only do your best and I(we all), appreciate it!

Okay-Dokay :-)

,sub5,2007-07-30T11:07Z,yeah i second upl8tr!! cheers mate
,upl8tr,2007-09-01T18:07Z,"Hi wCa0, 

any joy with the disks yet, I?ve tried everywhere on the net looking for another source for these disks and cannot find them anywhere else. 

I thought maybe if I could find them I could upload them and point to your torrent for the program, but no-one else seems to have them.

I?ve asked everyone I know and tried loads of forums on the web and everyone agrees that it is impossible to remove the media usage right from the copy you uploaded so unfortunately they are useless.

I?ll keep checking back and see if you have managed to get an unprotected copy of them from your friend, hopefully you will, as the program looks very good.

Regs, upl8tr.

(Anybody out there with any info, unprotected disks? brilliant ideas?get on board and help out!)
