The first time I listened to the songs, I was totally dazzled by the density of the songs; the music is composed like a collage of many little sound-fragments from classical music and distorted guitars to hiphop drum-samples and different noises. what makes the music interesting is that it constantly changes, there are hardly any repetitive parts, it's just an organic flow. From that viewpoint, it somehow reminded me of impressionalist compositions like Debussy and ultimatively, it sounds like a score for an old b/w movie. I prefer both ""the alleys of newtopia"" and ""yellow"". The former is probably most representative one of their style on the album. And in the meantime it is quite haunting because of the morbid string- and guitar-sounds. The latter is the most upbeat one of the tracks and shows just how straight to the point the beats are arranged while the track is accompanied by a lot of turntablism, weird synths and finally by rap. I am truly amazed!"

 I also like the many different little details which make your songs almost unbearably complex. Your songs do not get boring if you listen to them ten times in a row, but you finally are able to distinguish all the details. And every time you will find another detail that will attract your attention. 

 If I had to compare your music with the work of other artists, Amon Tobin would come to my mind. Especially his new album. And some of your melodies remind me of Massive Attack.

 The song which I probably like most is 'yellow', closely followed by 'deathless princess'. I think that 'yellow' is the most elaborate song of your album. And as far as 'deathless princess' is concerned; I just really like the melody and the way in which the song is set up.


 I take a bow."
