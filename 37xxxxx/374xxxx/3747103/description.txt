John Winston Ono Lennon, MBE (9 October 1940 ? 8 December 1980), was an Academy Award and Grammy Award-winning English songwriter, singer, musician, graphic artist, author and political activist who gained worldwide fame as one of the founders of The Beatles. Lennon and Paul McCartney formed a critically acclaimed and commercially successful partnership writing songs for The Beatles and other artists.[1] Lennon, with his cynical edge and knack for introspection, and McCartney, with his storytelling optimism and gift for melody, complemented one another uniquely.[2] In his solo career, Lennon wrote and recorded songs such as "Imagine" and "Give Peace a Chance".

Lennon revealed his rebellious nature and irreverent wit on television, in films such as A Hard Day's Night (1964), in books such as In His Own Write, and in press conferences and interviews. He channelled his fame and penchant for controversy into his work as a peace activist, artist, and author.

He had two sons, Julian, with his first wife Cynthia, and Sean, with his second wife, avant-garde artist Yoko Ono. Lennon was murdered by a deranged fan, Mark David Chapman, in New York City on 8 December 1980 after he and Ono returned home from a recording session.

In 2002, respondents to a BBC poll on the 100 Greatest Britons voted Lennon into eighth place. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked Lennon number 38 on their list of "The Immortals: The Fifty Greatest Artists of All Time"[3][4] and ranked The Beatles at number 1.

Lennon Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon is the third official compilation album of John Lennon's solo career, coming after 1975's Shaved Fish and 1982's The John Lennon Collection. Because neither collection spanned Lennon's releases up to and including 1984's Milk And Honey, Lennon Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon - considered the definitive Lennon retrospective - was compiled to rectify the situation. It was released in the UK in 1997 and early 1998 in the United States.

Lennon Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon reached #3 in the UK and #65 in the U.S. where it went gold. The album re-entered the UK Chart on 18th June 2007, almost 10 years after its release, at #30.

Lennon Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon was also released on DVD in 2003 as a series of remastered, remixed & new music videos with Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound audio mixes (See Lennon Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon DVD).
