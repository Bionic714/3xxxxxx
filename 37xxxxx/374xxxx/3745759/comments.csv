,MrKassner,2011-02-16T17:22Z,"Just so everyone knows, files are 128KBps wma, but they are tagged properly and sound great (not like the videos on YouTube of the vinyl rips).

To the uploader just some tips please next time only use mp3 or flac files and do not compress (rar) them as compression does nothing for music files, but either way thank you!"
,theroyalist,2011-02-23T12:32Z,Thanks for uploading this great album! One problem: how do you play .rar files??
,neznase,2011-05-27T19:49Z,You unrar them :))
,theroyalist,2011-05-30T12:13Z,"More constructively... You just need to download converting software - eg from winrar.com. It's a little messy, but I'm listening to Tone now, so can't be that complicated!

Molusken, thanks for this 80s classic! ""88's great, but 89's mine""..."
