..:: Search and Rescue 4 - Coastal Heros (.full\'n\'rare.) ::..


:. About.:

players assuming the role of a Coast Guard helicopter 
pilot and features no less than 100 new missions.

Rescue missions in the game will include airplanes crashed at sea,
leaking oil tankers, stranded hikers, lost children, and even a chemical 
factory explosion. Search and Rescue 4 will feature the most realistic 
physics in the series to date, and with helicopters responding to even 
the slightest joystick movement, gust of wind, or change of weather, 
just flying in a straight line or hovering in the air promises to be a challenge
 in itself. The three helicopters that players will get to fly in the game are the
 HH-5A Dauphin, the Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King, and the BK-117 C-1.

In Search and Rescue 4, players will be required to participate in the planning 
of each rescue mission, as well as in the actual flying. Factors that will need to 
be considered when planning a rescue operation will include weight problems,
fuel capacity, rescue procedures, weather, injury assessment, and much more.
