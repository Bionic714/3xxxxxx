[V],Subzero!,2007-07-17T14:58Z,"just check AGAIN by me, works fine, dont let your virustool delete the ""so called"" trojan, this is a false positive (read more about in your virustool document) if you have let the virus tool delete the file, thats the possible reason for this.... "
,Harvesterz,2007-08-28T13:56Z,"Thanks for the game SubZero!

[V],Subzero!,2008-03-28T01:23Z,"listen little noob... read the following...


Trojan/Virus is a bold word to use without proof, you should NEVER 
throw that word around public forums without some back.think twice 
about... before you make yourself look like a 12yrs old wanna be!.

guess you just celebrate your 11th birthday , do you?,..."

,Tuna_of_the_Gir,2009-01-31T22:17Z,"Hey guys.  I'm kinda new in this site, but not at torrents.  How ever when I try installing this game I get 1607:Installshield Scripting Runtime.  I turned off my Norton and my S&D, so is the problem my Daemon tool thats not working? "
,Qjoe,2009-07-10T17:56Z,if the intro does not play then simply rename the video file in the root dir . it will be skipped and the game will carry on loading. also try running the program in xp mode (click properties on the exe file)
