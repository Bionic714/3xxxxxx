Situated just below the North Pole, Iceland and Greenland in the North Atlantic are the lands where the Inuit people of the west first met the Norse people from the east. The harsh Arctic climate and the high cost of living means few visitors come here, but those who do discover lands of some of the most breathtaking and undisturbed snow and ice encrusted scenery in the world.

Iceland is the land that the Vikings tried to claim, with natural extremities of molten lava, boiling water, ice rain and snow. It claims some of the world's biggest waterfalls and glaciers, as well as panoramic countryside and serenity. Iceland is truly home to the great outdoors with hiking, horse riding, fishing, kayaking, whale watching and sea trips all on offer.
Greenland is the largest island in the world. It has been home to the Inuit people, but North of the Arctic Circle icebergs rule the sea, millions of years old and some the size of small islands.
