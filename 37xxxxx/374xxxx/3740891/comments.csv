,dynasoar,2007-07-13T21:47Z,"I respectfully suggest doing ISO images rather than NRG. Not everyone uses Nero, and there are far more programs that can handle ISO. It's still an exact copy."
,DOS622,2007-07-14T09:26Z,"I agree. Unfortunately, Nero (at least my version) doesn't offer the option to save the image from audio cd's as an ISO file."
,bradwjensen,2007-09-26T07:28Z,TIP - Just search got 'nrg to iso' in yahoo search and you'll find a simple converter right away.
,bradwjensen,2007-09-26T07:28Z,got = for.. lol
,this_is_not_me,2010-05-12T02:51Z,FYI - Audio disks can not be encoded to ISO format it is NOT supported that is why NRG or Bin Cue
