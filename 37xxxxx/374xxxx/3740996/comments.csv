,Cross_the_border731,2008-08-23T06:26Z,"to play on psp,
extract the iso/cso.
copy the file to the ""\ISO\"" folder on the root of the psp.

now, hold the ""R"" button (right rear button) and turn on the PSP.
a screen should come up with the title ""M33 Recovery Menu"".
go to ""Configuration"", and change the setting ""UMD Mode"" to ""M33 driver -NO UMD-"" with the ""X"" button.
select ""back"", then ""exit"".

Go to the memory stick under ""Game"".
The game should now come up."
,Cross_the_border731,2008-08-23T06:31Z,"hey pinche punetero tyrelleze,
