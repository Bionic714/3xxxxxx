    Â²Â³   Shock Stars began as an experimental electronic rock project for prominent        Â³Â±
    Â²Â³   Chicago musicians Stubhy (vocals/guitar/producer), Steve Smooth                   Â³Â±
    Â²Â³   (DJ/programmer/producer) and JJ Flores (keyboards/producer). As the project       Â³Â±
    Â²Â³   grew more serious, the three decided to put a full band together and added Brian  Â³Â±
    Â²Â³   Lee (guitars/vocals), Brian Sherman (guitars/vocals) and Joel Maske (drums).      Â³Â±
    Â²Â³                                                                                     Â³Â±
    Â²Â³   The band has enjoyed an early level of success due to the networking possibilites Â³Â±
    Â²Â³   of MySpace as well as old-fashioned word of mouth. Shock Stars sold out their     Â³Â±
    Â²Â³   first public performance headlining the legendary Double Door in Chicago. More    Â³Â±
    Â²Â³   recent performances include a headlining gig at the Metro in Chicago during the   Â³Â±
    Â²Â³   industry event MOBfest and an appearance at Milwaukee's Summerfest opening for    Â³Â±
    Â²Â³   AFI.                                                                              Â³Â±

    Â²Â³   Along with success on the live circuit, Shock Stars have had their songs played   Â³Â±
    Â²Â³   regularly on Chicago's alternative radio station Q101 during a segment called     Â³Â±
    Â²Â³   Crash Test Radio. They have also received critical praise on the industry         Â³Â±
    Â²Â³   website Kings of A&R (www.kingsofar.com) and are still a featured artist on the   Â³Â±
    Â²Â³   main page. Shock Stars also has been featured as a Pure Pick on the website       Â³Â±
