   Instructions
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
   Update your copy of 'James Bond 007: Nightfire' to version 1.1 using the 
   included update, then copy the cracked 'Bond.exe' over.
   
   Patch Changes
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
   Changes made for version 1.1:
   
   - Fixed AI bug where view height would be sometimes be at crouch level   
     when animation was standing.
   - Game would crash if Q-Specs were on between mission transitions, and   
     some level transitions.
   - Starting a multiplayer game after quitting a single player game with the
     Q-Specs on would carry over some of the vision mode.
   - Created bond_ded.exe, which is a dedicated server only .exe with no CD
     check.
   - The 18th server in a list of internet game servers couldn't be seen or
     scrolled to.
   - Ammo count limited in US build (was fixed already for European builds).
   - Exiting rocket mode before the rocket detonated would alter players view
     if they had been wearing the Q-Specs before firing the rocket.
   - Made it easier to take photos of the girls in Austria party room.
   - Fixed the jumping animation for players in multiplayer games.
   - Removed "say" and "say_team" commands from single player game.
   - Took explosion physics off subdued enemies at rest.
   - Added the multiplayer Combat Training map Istanbul and CTF map Space
     Station.
   
   Updated issues in the game:
   
   The current Radeon 9000 drivers (4.14.0001.9076) cause various graphical 
   issues such as: Players, weapons, and other objects are not visible. Sky 
   textures are not displayed and tracer effects appear.
   
                                "Hola!"
