,credington,2007-07-18T21:07Z,"No problem. I've found out this DVD is region free. I've now also got Dragon's Lair II and III, Mad Dog MCcree, Space Pirates, Bounty Hunter and Thayer's Quest.

What do people want me to upload first?"
,pfbi98,2007-07-18T21:23Z,I would love to have all of them. Thanks for offering them

,coffeeblack,2007-07-30T17:47Z,hey thanks for the upload m8;) how do i copy it though?
,credington,2007-07-30T23:05Z,To burn it to DVD use a burning tool like Nero or MagicISO. Good luck.
,coffeeblack,2007-08-01T06:43Z,thanks credington m8 its me thats confused lol do i need xbox or ps to place this or can i use my pc thx in advance:)
,credington,2007-08-01T11:57Z,It's a region free DVD so works in any DVD player. Use the remote control to steer Dirk. Have fun.

,NordicWolf,2007-12-08T21:09Z,"First of all thanks for this stroll down memory lane.
I have a problem though. The game continues (moves on to the next scene) regardless of whether I press the right button or die. I've tried both on a stand-alone DVD and my computer. Anyone else have this problem?"
,credington,2007-12-17T19:06Z,No-one else reports this. Try burning at lower speed? Different media?
,Gaggarin,2008-03-10T11:50Z,what keys do you use when you play it in media player?
,Gaggarin,2008-03-10T11:52Z,also.. Are you gonna upload dragons lair 3? Thx for these gems-.

,mythbuster420,2008-04-16T13:38Z,I dl'ed the others ( maddog macree-MACH3 etc )and they would not run.. Does this game run like it should?
,mythbuster420,2008-04-16T14:28Z,btw- im seeding at unlimited up speed. even though im only getting about 2 kb down.. i always seed at unlimited up..
,mythbuster420,2008-04-16T16:25Z,doesnt work.. not region free.. doesnt work in wmp. dont bother
,mjstriker5,2008-04-28T23:17Z,can anyone confirm if I burn this iso that it will work with daphne loader to play game on daphne? The programs says it needs the dvd to play but I was wondering if a burned dvd worked. thanks
[T],Huggybaby,2008-05-02T00:59Z,You can mount the image with Daemon tools and it will work with Daphne.
,Suspekt31,2008-05-21T22:56Z,"Just in case anyone still hitting this game. I was able to turn this into Region One by using Macthe Ripper.  I am sure there is an equivalent for the PC.  Maybe DVD Santa?  I tested it, and it works perfectly.  Now all I need to know is what the fucking controls are.

,skywalka,2008-05-26T09:30Z,I loaned the box set to someone & never saw them again.  Thanx 4 these credington.  Still chasing Space Ace though.
,coffeeblack,2008-06-08T13:36Z,hey suspect31 or anyone does anyone know the controls on the computer keyboard for this?
,credington,2008-07-06T09:39Z,Use the cursor keys!
,anon1978,2008-10-08T08:54Z,Thank you very much for the Dragons Lair post.  I just got done beating it with my DVD player.  It was lots of fun!  The Dragons Lair (end level) took me about 15 tries to beat though :)  The knight with the electricity was my biggest problem.  I never came close in the arcade since I was poor (and still am).  I appreciate you giving me the chance to play through this game.
,superloadedcat,2010-06-25T19:54Z,"to change to region 1

burn this image
dl and install Anydvd
open burnt dvd with anydvd
change to region one with anydvd
now you can read/play it
now use nero or whatever to make a region one image from whats open in anydvd (because anydvd make it look like a region 1, the resulting image will be region 1.)
now burn your new region 1 image and it will play in your usa r1 dvd player or drive"
,Tweaner,2010-12-20T20:52Z,"You don't need to burn a disc to use with Daphne. Just mount as a virtual DVD ROM with daemon tools and Daphne will use it to decode the automatic file download. BTW, Daphne uses a built-in bittorrent client for this, so you need to exit your regular client until it's finished."
,masterp90,2011-02-17T23:48Z,whats the button for sword attack?
,SABERWOLF357,2011-09-11T14:05Z,"Thanx :) This takes me back to the days when I was a kid :)

Keep seeding ;)"
