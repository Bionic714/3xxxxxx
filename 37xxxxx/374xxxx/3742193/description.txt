This is a DVD of the arcade game Dragons Lair. You can play it using the keys of your remote control. It's xbox compatible using the DVD remote. It's digitaly remastered.

Also contains rare footage/video clips of the makers and how they made it.

Includes previews of their other games, such as Space Ace, Dragons Lair 2, Mad Dog Mcree and loads of others.

Plays just like the arcade.

Upload will be slow (evenings GMT and weekends) so please be patient.

Also help me seed at all times!

Thanks goes out to the makers of this revolutionary game!
