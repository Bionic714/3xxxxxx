A few days ago, I posted "LockerRoom Rumble 2," with Brett Akers featured on the cover.  This is one incredibly hot-looking dude, and some of the shoutbox comments I got seemed to agree!  

From his homepage at http://hometown.aol.com/ruffnruggd/, seems like a really nice guy!

This 2003 clip from ButchBear showcases Brett in an outside session with Lee McDermott.  You'll see Brett's hot body, his wonderful facial expressions, and his versatility!  At 136 MB, it should be a quick download.  The quality is excellent, and Brett fans will definitely rejoice!
