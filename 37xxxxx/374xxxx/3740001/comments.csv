,Ganesh420,2007-08-08T00:06Z,"CaptCapitalism blows giant cocked midgets!  Do you REALLY stop to comment on every torrent you don't like?  THAT'S what's gross.  I bet it'd only take a sixpack to make you my butt bitch ;)

Anyway, thanks for the DL!"

All surprised and everything!!

This is what was going on. 
CaptCapitalism (I'll just call him Priscilla from now on), .... Priscilla was sitting one day feelin all horny. It's just that lately he's noticed an itch he doesn't quite know how to scratch. Str8 porn is good n all but... there is just something missing and Priscilla can't put his finger on what it is. Maybe it's that recently he's looking more at the cock goin in and out of the pussy more than the actual pussy itself. He's pondering why he can't find that one cum-worthy scene in any of the porn he downloads. 

Then he realizes.

""WHAT!!?? There is actually gay porn here?? Wtf.. gross"" (I gotta know ....exactly how gross it is tho) ***clicks ""download this torrent""***

,Ashuram,2007-12-30T20:55Z,"Ok about the actual video.

This was a SHOWCASE vid.
It's a 15min clip of two bears outside. Some fondling cock grabbing and nipple pinching a few seconds of pre penetration teasing and NO cumshot. NO SOUND, only cheesy porno music.

IMO, like watching paint dry.
Sounds boring to you? Then don't waste time downloading this."
