,Zapem,2007-07-22T10:07Z,"Dash 8

The Dash 8 was originally developed for FS2002, and freely patched for FS9 (FS2004). It will not be updated to FSX"
,eNuffSaid,2007-07-22T11:22Z,Lovely stuff. Thank you.
,packo88,2007-07-22T13:38Z,Well Zapem...... I've done it... FSX ready
,shmuckhead,2007-07-22T13:52Z,Great package! Fast DL. Easy exe. install. Really nice plane. Thanks! Much appreciated. Will seed.

,henrythedog,2007-07-24T00:28Z,"thanks just what i was after, glass cockpit version doesn't seem to work though"
,yago2000,2007-09-04T21:39Z,"Thanks very much for such a nice work. But still its having few problems with gauges. For example when you load FS flight plan in FMS the Sim crashes. Glass cockpit doesnt work. One main problem when u start engine manually and u press start button on ovehead panel, NH1 gauge sticks around 7 or 8. In actual it should go to 12 then u open fuel supply to start engine. There r some minor problems with it. If you solve these problems then I think it gonna be the best Fsx dash 8 ever available. Hope you will make it better. Wait for the new update. Best regards. Yago "
,MBroony,2007-11-25T20:59Z,can someone plz seed thanks
,kondu,2008-01-24T10:44Z,"Thanks. There is one problem! I have Vista and the plane and VC views are just plain white, only the 2D cockpit shows in details. Can somebody help me with this problem?"
,littlep2000,2008-03-01T00:07Z,Is anyone else having the steering fail after making a landing? It works great pre takeoff but once in the sky (or maybe once it is up) the turn wheel no longer works.
,Andper92,2008-03-21T17:45Z,all white plane? :S
,leobarrichello,2008-03-24T00:09Z,"Hello People at TPB

I've installed the Dash 8 for FSX in Vista.
The planes and VC panel are all white of texture.
Anyone a solution

regards,

Leobarrichello"
,leobarrichello,2008-03-25T15:50Z,"The problem with white textures and VC is because I'm using Vista with Direct X 10 in FSX.
You'll need to uncheck this in FSX and start up FSX again. Problem solved"
