In the French countryside an elegant woman pays a nostalgic visit to her adolescent girl?s school, where she passionately remembers her first fiery and forbidden romance...the story of Therese and Isabelle. The tenderness of these two lonely girls' erotic awakenings sensuously blossoms amidst the hothouse atmosphere of their repressive environment. Having both experienced the clumsy and cruel lovemaking attempts of the local lothario, Therese and Isabelle grow closer and closer to each other - until that fateful moment when they become lovers.
