2pac and Growing up in the ghetto...., 15 November 2003
10/10
Author: ice_man_39 from Canada

This documentary shows everything about 2pac's life, you can really dive into his character and see how complex he is. His accomplishments during a period of 6 years (pretty much) is really inspirational. He isn't a hero, or he at least didnt have enough time to transform into one, but I think the message was quite clear: Give (black) people a chance and they can do great things. That's pretty much what this movie is about and it can be enjoyed on many levels by different races simply because of - struggle. "
