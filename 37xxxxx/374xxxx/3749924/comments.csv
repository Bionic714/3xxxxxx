Contains the Trojan Horse Virus called Downloader.

Still some viruses in keygens aint harming your computer. Just wanted everyone to know."
,TaiTheGuy,2011-06-01T12:45Z,"OK, I did not download this... YET.
Just wanted to point out that keygens ARE viruses. They are GOOD viruses that hack into the program that you would otherwise need a ""KEY"" for. KEY-GEN (Key Generator), (Norton knows this but it's too dumb to tell the difference).

So, in closing, keygen = virus = possibly bad/but almost always GOOD."
,Jaudrop,2011-06-03T11:48Z,"TaiTheGuy, you are dumb. You are really dumb, for real. Just because your nub Norton a/v gives you a bit of info that doesn't make it true. By your logic your anti-virus is a virus because it can read and write over crucial system files that keep your computer running. Please refrain from spreading ignorance. "
