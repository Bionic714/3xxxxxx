                       Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Zoologist Nigel Marven tracks down the biological roots of our sensory perception including smell, taste, hearing balance touch and vision in this BBC series first aired in Great Britain in 2003.

                       Author/Presenter - Nigel Marven

Born in 1960, Nigel Marven showed early promise as a budding naturalist. He was running a hamster colony at age eight and racing stick insects along his mother?s clothes line by the time he was nine. In his early teens, Nigel had graduated to larger creatures, keeping a caiman, magpie and boa constrictors in his parents? house. He even saved a freshwater eel from being jellied, housing it in the bathtub. When anyone needed a soak, the slippery creature was put in a bucket.

Family holidays in the Mediterranean became zoological expeditions, as young Nigel scampered over the countryside, pillowcase in hand, catching snakes and lizards for study and then release. Once his school studies were over, Nigel took a year-out travelling throughout America, where he met hellbenders and amphiumas in the wild (both are kinds of salamanders). Returning to the UK, he moved to Bristol to read Botany and Zoology at university. This would prove to be the ideal place for him, because firstly he could pursue his interest in the natural world at an academic level, and secondly, Bristol is the world capital of wildlife filmmaking.

He got his first job at the world-famous BBC Natural History Unit in Bristol, and stayed there for several years. It was there that he produced and directed episodes of major international projects such as The Life of Birds (with Sir David Attenborough), Realms of the Russian Bear, The Witness was a Fly and Magpie in the Dock. In 1998 he moved from the BBC to start work on an exciting new wildlife project for Granada Television; this time he would not only produce the films, but also be in front of the camera as a presenter.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 1:

Smell
In the first programme of the series Nigel Marven goes in search of the most disgusting and the most attractive smells. Nigel visits Albuquerque to test out what is regarded as one of nature's worst smells ? skunk odour. He volunteers to get 'skunked' and hidden cameras observe the effect this skunk smell has on people in a crowded shopping mall. Not everyone is disgusted by the skunk odour - some people seem unaffected. Our sense of smell has evolved to warn us off eating bacteria-infested meat like this, which would almost certainly kill us.

The world's worst smell 
At the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia scientists have been developing the world's first universally repellent smell, so utterly disgusting it could be used for crowd control. In the course of their research at Monell, scientists tested naturally occurring smells that people found offensive. They discovered big differences in how people react to these smells. Our reactions are partly innate, but heavily shaped by our own personal experiences. For the grand finale, Nigel volunteers to try out the ?stench soup? developed by the team. He takes a tiny sniff of the weapons grade stink and is convulsed with disgust.

Taste
Nigel Marven sets out to discover the biological reasons why humans eat such a diverse range of foods, from rotten raw ducks eggs to a sweaty blue cheese. At a chilli eating contest, he pushes his taste buds to the limit.

Try anything once 
Compared to many animals, humans have a 'try anything once' attitude to food. This has allowed us to populate every corner of the planet, while many other animals depend totally on one food source for their energy. This limited diet restricts where they can live to locations that provide the type of food they need. Our taste buds allow us to enjoy or reject foods that are good or bad for us, but how do we end up with extraordinary tastes that vary across different cultures? Nigel persuades a group of people raised on Chinese food to try out a ripe stilton cheese, while a group of gourmet cheese lovers try a Chinese delicacy known as a 'Thousand Year Old Egg' - a preserved fermented raw duck egg. Both groups, trying these tastes for the first time, find them revolting. But as a species, we have a remarkable ability to learn to love the taste of almost anything, however strange it tastes, as long as it doesn't make us sick.

Pleasure from chillis 
More than a quarter of the world's population eat chillies at least once a day. Nigel meets Professor Paul Rozin from the University of Pennsylvania who has studied why we come back for the big burn time and time again. He believes they give the same pleasure that people get from a roller-coaster ride. It's all about pushing your taste buds to the limit. Eating the hottest chilli you can bear can be exhilarating - as long as you know it's not doing any lasting damage.
