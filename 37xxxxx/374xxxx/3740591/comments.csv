,gpf_drizit,2008-01-02T08:04Z,how about a seed here?
,fredrikmo,2008-03-23T23:26Z,Seed plz
,vejviseren,2008-10-19T23:43Z,OMFG get some seeding on this file
,CaptainMidnight,2008-11-03T04:18Z,"Low resolution, low quality video, only 352x272, lots of noise, probably VHS rip. If you want episodes to keep, look elsewhere."
,Scorpwanna,2008-12-31T07:42Z,CaptainMidnight is lying. I had it seeded forever. I can't seed it by myself
,Scorpwanna,2008-12-31T07:50Z,"These were originally in a private tracker, once I had them downloaded, I created a public version. The rips were by Demension each in their own folder packed as rar files. DVDRIPS too high quality. But it's been over a year since I uploaded this so. It's just died down to something better."
,mparouta,2009-01-29T20:40Z,I can seed all the Wolf's episodes as soon as i would download them. But if there's sb to seed this it would be good. After that i could seed it continously!
,littleohah,2009-03-16T01:36Z,any one know where to get the complete show from  
,littleohah,2009-03-29T03:50Z,or torrents with complete seasons with seeds
