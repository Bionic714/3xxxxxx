Monster Hunter Portable 2nd is the sequel to one of the most popular PSP? games released in 2006. The sequel is themed after the PlayStation2? version, including winter and desert landscapes amongst its many hunting grounds.

Tremendous vistas range out for miles, with animated waterfalls and forests full of trees. Witness monsters several times larger than your own hero, using every bit of the PSP's wide-angle screen to display their majestic animation and razor-sharp texture work in full glory. The framerate is buttery-smooth, and character detail is again ridiculously sharp for this game's complex and ever-changing character models.

Wireless gameplay has been included for four adventurers.

I have pre-patched this ISO with the latest translation files made by Zeal. (Which was quite annoying to do, might I add...)
I have been playing for 4 hours, and it is definitely 100% playable.

Quest objectives are in English, so are item names, menus, and a bunch of other stuff.
Some menus aren't in English, but as soon as you enter them, it quickly becomes clear what they are.

Hope this is appreciated, and new translation files don't come out any time soon...D:
