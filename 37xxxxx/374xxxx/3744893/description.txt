Tom Mabe Revenge on the Telemarketers (Comedy mp3)
Tomâ??s fist CD
All of Tomâ??s fame and fortune grew out of his annoyance with telemarketers calling the jingle composer at home "When youâ??re self-employed, you jump when the phone rings hoping itâ??s a client," Tom says. "The last thing you want is a telemarketer trying to sell you something."
It wasnâ??t long before Tom was inundated with phone solicitations. "More and more of the calls I got werenâ??t clients offering work," Tom recalls. "They were these annoying people offering me long distance service or credit cards or some dumb time-share in Florida."
Frustrated, Tom decided to strike back at the intrusive callers, complicating their sales presentations by using a myriad of disguised voices and putting them in compromising situations; all the while recording the calls on his home answering machine in Louisville, KY. Tomâ??s impromptu creation of off-the-wall characters in unorthodox situations leaves those salespeople unfortunate enough to dial his number shaking in their swivel chairs.
