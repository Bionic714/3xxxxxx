X-Ray Dog - "Gothic Power"

X-Ray Dog primarily produces high-end orchestral and choral music for movie and TV trailers. Their music is generally not available to consumers, as they market directly to movie studios.

One of the most popular cues is "Gothic Power" which has been used in many film advertising campaigns including "The Lord Of The Rings" (2001). There are different versions of this title that obviously was inspired by Carl Orff's "O Fortuna".
