So unless you have a lot of time to waste trying to get these to work I would suggest downloading from a different ripper.

The logic of this guy eludes me. Why share files that very few people seem to be able to play.

I would advise downloading from a different ripper. It will save you a lot of bandwidth and a whole lot of hassle. Prolific he may be, but quantity is no substitute for quality."

First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.


Install those and report back!

If you download those 3 and install them all downloads from HDTV CHINA will work Have downloaded 40 and all works"

,LAMBORGHINI38,2010-03-16T09:12Z,where are the seeders and subs info?
,mlauzon76,2012-05-26T09:31Z,"I've never had any problems with HDChina releases ever, however, I won't be trying to download this until there are a lot more seeders or it -- or another release group's remux -- shows up on one of the private trackers I am on."
,mlauzon76,2012-05-26T09:33Z,"Ack, ignore my previous post -- although like I said, never a problem with a HDChina release -- just noticed this was the first movie, which I saw in the theatre, I'm waiting for the second one to show up as a remux."
