,hasslo,2007-07-22T07:06Z,yes but this is  a preair
,bittrucker,2007-07-22T12:42Z,Quality could have been a lot better.. Still worth getting if you cant wait til August 13.
,chalkitdown,2007-07-22T15:33Z,^^The quality seemed exactly the same as every episode of season 1 & 2 that I've downloaded. There was nothing wrong with it.
,ivar____,2007-07-22T16:43Z,thx
,bittrucker,2007-07-22T16:48Z,"chalkitdown: Then I suggest you go get your eyes checked, or, download better quality caps of S1&2 :)
This one is definitely more blurry and has quite a bit of compression artifacts. Still not a bad release compared with some, but could be better."
,Softwarezer,2007-07-22T23:23Z,Awesome.
,gettab,2007-08-15T10:56Z,does anyone know the songs on this episode/season?
,Bonfan,2007-08-15T16:10Z, this is ep. of seson 2... not tre... :(
,JBQ23,2007-08-22T17:27Z,"Bittruker is talking shit. The quality is absolutely fine. Perhaps, if you're gonna watch it on a huge widescreen tv it wont be crystal clear but on my laptops widescreen monitor its just fine. 
If you want HD tv quality you're gonna have to download something bigger than 233mb! 

Thankyou hasslo :)"
