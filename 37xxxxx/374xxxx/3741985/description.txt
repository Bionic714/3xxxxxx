Tagline:The criminal mind is a terrible thing to waste 

Plot Outline:
A clueless, aspiring criminal named John â??Ruggedâ?? Rudgate spends
his days forging rebate coupons and selling speakers out the back of
his van. One day, Rugged runs into an old acquaintance, the dim-
witted Jeff Lagrand, who recently returned home to help his cynical
sister run the storage facility that they inherited from their father.
When Rugged tries to force his way into the Lagrand family
business, things go terribly wrong--and the situation gets even
more complicated when an emotionally unstable cop
begins investigating.
