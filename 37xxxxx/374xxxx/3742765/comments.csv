,Panodilo,2007-07-15T16:33Z,"Fan-fucking-tastic! Thanks for this. Quite a stash of FSX warez already. Just sold the missus's left kidney and a couple of pints of my mother's blood and bought an IntelCore2Duo E6600 and some other tasty shit. From what I hear that ain't shit, that FSX will eat my ass for lunch and spit me into a commode."
,troppo1,2007-07-15T18:06Z,"thanks here also mate, now that I have learnt how to seed I will be leaving my pc on for while to help out. xxxx(4orex) was a good QLD Australian beer, so you got a good name."

,eNuffSaid,2007-07-15T22:28Z,"Thank you 4X. Love the scenery addons. Keep 'em coming.

Cheers,
'nuff"
,OldViking,2007-07-15T22:46Z,"4X-AXG, you da man!!  Sincerest thanks mate.

DERECTIV, awesome call for the terrain config update.

Copy/paste those lines with Notepad to the ""terrain"" config file in your main FSX folder. 

Scroll down and add it to the list below the Vector Textures defintions. You'll see where it goes if you look.

Next, add the correct numbers in place of the ""xxx"", numbering up from your last entry in the stock file. My final number was [Texture.421].

Now go up and under the [General] list, change the DefaultTextureCount= to your total count. Mine was 421, thus I changed it to that.

Go fly!

,yeoldecaptain,2008-01-01T22:20Z,"Note that i installed this and followed directions in the notepad file to the tee.  I now have land and grass where ocean should be, so now I have AI Cruise liners and yachts chasing Legolas thru the woods.

Anyone know how to fix this?

On the commentsd above about ""copying lines from the notepad file to the TERRAIN.CFG file, uhm . . .  I must be missing that notepad file, mates, because after this downloaded I could find no such notepad file with any terrain cfg lines to enter into the file.  I searched my etrrain.cfg file for this ""DEFAULTTERRAIN="" line and it doesn't exist there.  Sorry **shrug**"
,whiskey_bandit,2008-02-28T19:00Z,hmmm seems the post containing the valuable terrain info is missing.  It used to be posted but now it's gone.  This software will not work without the required cfg info.  Does someone have it??
,southsky,2008-08-17T22:43Z,"try this one it works fine:

No trees in the see (Seaplane friendly)"
,tbart,2009-04-04T00:39Z,"Do a GOOGLE search for terrain.cfg fix. There are downloadable terrain.cfg files that will fix the problems people are having. The problem is a well documented bug that's related to changes made to the terrain.cfg file after SP2 or Accelleration Expansion Pack are installed.
Happy Happy
