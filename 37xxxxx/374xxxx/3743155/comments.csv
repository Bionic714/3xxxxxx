members ???"
,ChatteSophia,2007-08-05T14:57Z,Grattis. du har lyckats fixa ena skivan med svensk text men inte disc 2. bravo!
,Tobbe_316,2008-01-04T00:58Z,"Hur kan disc 2 vara utan svensk text? Dom borde ""hĂ¤nga ihop"" med varandra... Ge oss klarhet i detta, tack."
,MajorIce,2008-04-17T17:48Z,Ă&#x201E;r texten fixad och reseedad nu?
,subaiku,2008-08-12T04:03Z,erm... just finished downloaded this... this isn't actually the 2 disc set... it's actually the movie split into two discs?... why?... :p
,banisters,2008-08-27T07:07Z,"@subaiku

it never said it was the two disc version.. its actually a dvd9 split into two parts,so it will fit on two regular (dvd5) dvdr instead of the more expensive dvd9 dvdr. all this to keep the bitrate,as it is untouched (not downsampled)."
,mr_gennaro,2009-03-25T21:22Z,So is there a way to change the subtitles on disc 2?
