,h1n1,2007-07-15T09:36Z,questions. im curious if this works without a mod chip? i know that the actual product does but i doubtful that a burnt disc will work. also anybody know if this will work with a ppc mac?
,FatJoe junior,2007-07-15T12:37Z,You can get this to work with an exploit.. Not sure about mac...
,FatJoe junior,2007-07-16T11:40Z,"Where did you download this?? It would be nice to see their website and read their information about this... But I will give a try for this today...
And NO you cant use this in unmodded ps2 without exploit or boot disk..."
