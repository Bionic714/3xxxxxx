It's finally here!

The new Version of the best USB Utility for PS2!

I Proudly present the new version of USBAdvance!

As already uploaded by someone else I made a new FAULT-LESS File from it, it's a .rar archive.

Needed for this program to work:

A working PS2

A USB HDD that is not over 250 GB

A PC with windows 2000 or over.

...And this software.

Burn this program to a CD-R disc and plug in the USB HDD into your computer.

Take the .iso or .mds games that you downloaded and put them into the USB HDD.

Plug it out.

Put it into your PS2's USB input.

Put in the Disc.

Press the power button, and you're good to go.

Enjoy this software!
