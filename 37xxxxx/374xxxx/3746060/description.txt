Juiced is a racing simulation that totally immerses players in the 
lifestyle, community and risk-taking of the real-life street modding
scene in a unique and compelling way. Juiced doesn't pay lip-service to 
the modding scene, it takes players there and immerses them in the 
culture - racing for pink slips, creating crews and providing the complete 
freedom to customize cars - from the dashboard to the drivetrain. 

Featuring over 50 licensed cars, 200 official aftermarket parts, 
and incredible online head-to-head play for up to 6 players and 
team-based racing; Juiced is one of this year's most anticipated 
racing titles.
