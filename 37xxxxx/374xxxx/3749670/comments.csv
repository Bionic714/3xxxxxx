,darh templar,2007-07-25T21:08Z,"I get an error...

""A debugger has been detected

has anyone had the same error?...
What is it talking about?..."
,BlackStormBSS,2007-07-30T01:46Z,"Can someone type up some instructions on how you use this? I read both the readme and the pdf and they are kind of confusing to me. I understand to copy the game/program folder from a windows machine to the mac and put it IN the app package. I kind of understand about the editing the .plist file. And I don't know about where they tell me to rename it the same as my game. =/ do I name it as the folder name I copied in there or the name of the .exe file that is running?

Also, if everything I did was right, it starts to open itself and then just closes. I get no errors or anything. Is there a way to debug it or something so I can try to figure out the problem? Thanks!

,stupidcorn,2008-04-04T19:32Z,Can this be used for apps other than games? I've got this crazy idea to use it to make EAC work in MacOS X...
,Dobik2000,2008-06-05T00:16Z,"I also had that problem, where once you did what the instructions told the application launches and quits instantly.
As for getting it to work for other kinds of applications, I have no idea. I guess the basic ""porting"" would be the same, but I don't know if it contains the appropriate frameworks and libraries. If you do manage (on a game or not), please post how you did it..."
,Dobik2000,2008-06-06T19:24Z,"Hey, stupidcorn, I did some reading and apparently you can't use this for other applications cause it can't render WinBlows windows, so unless you find a full screen version of that ""EAC"" app you want, it won't work..."
