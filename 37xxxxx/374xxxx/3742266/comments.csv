,IM_SO_LOL,2007-10-30T11:48Z,"This torrent is just a major ass-crack, it's crack doesn't work and... and ARGH! It doesn't work."
,Tomatsoppa,2007-11-26T11:19Z,"The crack works for me perfect, have used it in several months now without any problems. There's an txt file with instructions how to crack it.

1. copy the crack to the psp installed dir. usually C:\Program Files\Jasc Software Inc\Paint Shop Pro 8
2. once there locate the sub-dir. named as : Commands & look there for the file: JascCmdNonGraphic.dll right click with your mouse and check its properties. make sure is not in read only mode
3. now you're ready to apply the crack               
4. Enjoy!"

,mudkip,2008-02-02T15:03Z,okej im stupid just so you know.. were do i put the crack? or you know.. what file should i crack?  everything else i understod. sorry. my first..
,Tomatsoppa,2008-02-02T23:41Z,mudkip: Copy the crack to where you installed the program but don't run it yet. Go to the sub-directory Commands and look for the file JascCmdNonGraphic.dll and right click it and select properties. Take away the read only properties. After that you can run the crack that you copied before.

,mastergkilla,2008-08-27T17:48Z,"nice download speed, after reading the text file, looked for the nongraphic.ddl file, found it and took out the read only, after that i copy the crack to the installation directory, and aply the crack, but it dont work for me, instead of a full version i get the anouncement the specified file is not supported, ofcourse not its a crack, but after that the program stops, so tell me how to crack it, i dont do this for the first time, but it seems not to working except for everybody else who took it.

Im waiting for response
mastergkilla"
,Tomatsoppa,2008-09-05T20:06Z,"mastergkilla: I don't know why it's not working for you, I haven't created the crack-program for it. You're trying to use it on Win XP or Win Vista or something else? I have XP and works for me."
,mastergkilla,2008-09-08T13:40Z,"First thanks tomatsoppa for your quick reaction, i really want this program and not the new versions because they're to big, but i will try it again, to see if maybe i've done something wrong. Thanks anyway, also a note for those people who dont know how to work with cracks patches keygens torrents in general, please ask for guidance a not just diss everything if it dont work, there is no computer the same so keep in mind that you use and download cracked stuff, where people that are good put in time for crack things for free so people like me have not to buy stuff. So even if it didnt work for me, thanks anyway

,seripley,2008-09-17T16:50Z,"I can't get the crack to download and I'm not quite sure why. First timer, here, sorry lol. "
,Rasham,2008-09-27T04:32Z,If your running Windows Vista in order for the crack to work follow the instructions Tomatsoppa gave but run the crack as administrator.
,ginotheman,2008-10-22T21:50Z,"snälla seed...... har fastnat vid 88,2% så plzzzzz seed"

,Tomatsoppa,2008-10-27T15:25Z,"Jag seedar då och då, men det finns andra seeders också (ska finnas iaf....)"
[T],LucasJackson37,2008-11-04T06:01Z,Crack doesn't seem to work. It does nothing.
,raptozilla,2009-10-03T18:29Z,"Works perfectly. You have to put the crack in the installation folder where the C:\\Jasc Software Inc.\Paint Shop Pro 8 folder where the Paint Shop Pro 8.exe file is then go to the Commands folder to uncheck the ""read only"" attribute in the dll file. Run the crack as instructed from the folder you installed it in, and the crack will work. To check it, start the Paint Shop Pro program, go to the Help menu, to About Paint Shop Pro. If the crack didn't work, it will say that it's the trial version, and if it did work, it will not say that. However, after applying the crack, you may have to start and close the program two or three times before the crack will remove the trial version message there, so don't automatically assume the crack didn't work; start and close the program several times first to give the crack a chance to take effect and then check the About Paint Shop Pro"
,raptozilla,2009-10-08T19:21Z,"This is an excellent download. Many thanks to the uploader. I tried version 12, but it was too expansive which made it very unstable, so I tried version 9; that too was unstable. I recently downloaded and installed this version, and it works perfectly; not too big and not at all unstable. It has many of the features of the newer versions with the stability of the earlier versions. Thanks again, Tomatsoppa"
,macrinius,2010-05-10T22:57Z,"
I did struggle for a while, trying to use the crack, but managed it eventually.
Thanks very much for it."
,s3wind,2011-03-27T05:09Z,"I'm about ready to give up, but I'm willing to bet I've done something really wrong.
While downloading, my Norton identified a trojan and apparently stopped it. 
I clicked properties of the crack, unchecked ""Read Only"" then ""apply"" and ""okay"" so it should have stayed unchecked, right? But when I hit properties again, ""Read Only"" was again selected.  
So, I'm assuming that the crack would run, if my computer wasn't making it ""Read Only"" even after I unchecked ""read only""?
I have never attempted to install or run a crack, so this is very VERY new to me.  I understand the previously mentioned instructions, but something tells me that when I open the ""crack"" folder, it shouldn't just be blank every time.  Am I right?"
