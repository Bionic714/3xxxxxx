Installed using  YZM4Y-VKKBB-7MDZ4-FFDZZ-DVVDY

You need to update to v1.3, by using the v1.0-v1.3 patch in the download section at the ShipSim website, to get multiplayer and mission editor.

Re-enter the same serial when prompted during the update.

,thomas930,2009-01-30T17:08Z,"Have problems with New Horizons add-on after installing ATI Catalyst9.1

Hi, I am using Windows Vista with ATI Radeon 2900 display card and having problems with New Horizons add-on after installing ATI Catalyst9.1 which is released on 1/29/2009.

After I had installed ATI Catalyst? 9.1 Display Driver for Windows Vista (32 bit), I opened shipsim.exe and error occured with APPCRASH by atiumdag.dll.

I have tried re-install the ship simulator, its no problem if i just install the ship simulator 2008 basic pack. The problem is occured after I install the ship simulator 2008 basic pack with New Horizons add-on (not Collector's Edition).

I think the problem is coming from ATI Catalyst? 9.1 Display Driver since everything comes normal after I rolling back to the Catalyst? 8.12 Display Driver for Windows Vista (32 bit) . Hope that the offical developers can solve the problems....."

Thirt; On this page; http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4175407/Ship_Simulator_2008_New_Horizons_[English][PCDVD]. 
Will you find 'New Horizons' Its a add-on for Ship Simulator 2008(I STRONGLY recommed this add-on; It contains 20 new missions and around 15 new Boats; and better graphics.). I will not work with the serial code in the Readme. First install this Ship Simulator with the serial in the Readme(MFKMY-DDDZV-TBZ7V-FAFTZ-AT4MZ). Than when you will instal the Add-on use first(They will ask 2 Serial codes.) MFKMY-DDDLV-TBV7V-FAFTLAT4ML. Second use this Serial; FMTTV-6V4DV-AA4MZ-CCB64 VFDKZ.

This will work fine, You only can't play online.

#
A Channel or DLL error after an update is caused by the Windows Vista Virtual Store repository. Please try to run the program unregister.exe from the installation folder of Ship Simulator 2008 (default location C:\Program Files\Vstep\Ship Simulator2008\). This cleans the ""Virtual store"". If you are running Windows Vista and you are familiar with computers you can fix this by emptying the Virtual Store manually. To do so open your windows explorer window and proceed to the following folder: ?C:\Users\  \AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files\?. Delete any file or folder inside the VSTEP folder. If this folder does not exist, your Virtual Store is already empty. Please note that you need to have the ""Show hidden files and folder"" option on, otherwise you will not see these folders."

,powergear,2011-07-16T04:46Z,"This app worked on my Win7 64-bit using the included serial.

To update the program to v1.4.2 go to http://www.shipsim.com/downloads/updates and download it from the site's Ship Simulator 2008-Updates tab.
Install the update and run using the following key:  dtzev-zdzzv-hvt72-4cftz-496ay (typed in lower case)

I never used any backups as mentioned above posts.  It worked for me. Enjoy!"
,decter9,2011-08-04T16:42Z,"@powergear thanks for that worked fine for me. everything works perfect on windows 7 64bit with latest version, exepct multiplayer but is that because it's cracked?
