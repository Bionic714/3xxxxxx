Wu Xia Qi Gong Zhu aka Holy Weapon (1993)

Premise: Sporadic conflict between Japanese invaders and Chinese during the Ming Dynasty plays out in the martial world as China's hero Mo Kake (Damian Lau) meets the challenge of Japan's evil 'Super Sword' (Simon Yam), with the aid of seven virgin maidens.

Plot:	The convoluted tale about seven female fighters who team up to battle evil. Wong Jing has assembled an all-star cast here, but did he actually have a script for them when they all showed up for work?
