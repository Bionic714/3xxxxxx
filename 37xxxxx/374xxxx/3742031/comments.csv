,ithiz,2007-07-16T01:40Z,i wonder one thing.. how do i burn it with no break/pause with wmp or nero. It get fuckd up everytime i try. Ty :-)
,ToiletPaper!  =),2007-07-16T22:47Z,"Well, Im not quite sure about this, but I think there's a simple solution to this problem:
1:Start Nero StartSmart and choose ""MAKE AUDIO CD"", with NERO EXPRESS.
2:Add all the songs from one of the cd's.
3:Choose the option ""No pause between tracks""
4:Click next. Now, at ""Final Burn Settings"", click at the ""MORE"" button and make sure that the Write Method is ""Disc-at-once"".
5:Burn! :D

Hope this work for you, if not, I have no idea what to do but read forums! ;]"
,Bonex,2007-07-18T22:45Z,"Ska bara säga dig att det är bra att du (eller någon) har delat skivorna. Men du kan absolut inte fixa dem efter. Stavningen är helt kass och varför vill man att det står Pulsedriver och Rave Allstar framför alla? Du verkar inte veta ett dugg om taggar inom winamp eller vad du nu använt.

Torrent ; 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5
