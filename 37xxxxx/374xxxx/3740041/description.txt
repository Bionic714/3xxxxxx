The documentary, called Animal Camera, makes use of innovative camera, sound, tracking and surveillance technology.
Series highlights include footage from tiny miniature cameras strapped to birds and a sequence that solves the mystery of what baboons do at night.
The series has been made by the BBC's Natural History Unit in Bristol.
In DVD2 scientists tracked a bumblebee using a tiny radar transponder on the insect, to find out how they navigate.
