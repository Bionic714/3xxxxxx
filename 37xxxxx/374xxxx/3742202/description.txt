Could it be that Beavis and Butt-head are super-powered athletes? 
Nah. These two clowns couldn't putt a ball into the broad side of a barn, 
and their general ineptitude and lack of concentration is going 
to make things very difficult on you. 
Play 18 holes of miniature golf each inspired by the 
much-loved MTV cartoon series in this hilarious challenge.
Watch out for nacho cheese volcanoes, haunted tombstones, 
flying buzz saws, and much more as you try to lower your 
handicap and get Beavis and Butt-head out of harm's way.
