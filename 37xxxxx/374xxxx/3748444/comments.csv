,nygrenbjorn,2007-07-21T23:34Z,Why use DivX when there's two better formats: XviD and x264
,SoundWall,2007-07-22T01:05Z,"nygrenbjorn,
Xvid and DivX are the same thing. Xvid is basically an open-source version of DivX. Also, just because something is encoded in a better format doesn't mean that the source is of better quality.

I'm guessing this one is fake as well, since I haven't seen any other DVD rips of SM3 up yet.
Though I'd be real interested to hear from those of you who dl this if it's the real deal or not."
,nygrenbjorn,2007-07-22T20:23Z,"I know they are similar but XviD is still better, and what do you mean by source is of better quality, what has that anything to do with formats :S"
