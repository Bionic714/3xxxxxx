If I don't get the Autogen Pack I'll light my hair on fire.

I downloaded this one yesterday from another source but haven't loaded it yet.  Has anyone loaded it and how does she look?

Of course we will have to wait for the updates.  France VFR do some good work but they should spend more time in Beta IMO."
,SimDude423,2007-07-15T10:16Z,"MOTHERFUCKER 4X!
You mother fucker 4X,show some respect to your fellow FS pirates and give some credit. It fuckin pisses us people,who actually buy the addons,share it. We dont' care that it's on TPB or fuckin WF,we fuckin hate it when you go sharing our shit without giving some credit to the original purchaser. Is it that fuckin hard to do. You're like a fuckin leechmasturbater,SHIT!You could at least give some credit,is that too much to ask?and if it is,quit leeching,and ACTUALLY help out the fs community and shut the fuck up,and go hide in your damn iraqi mom's fat fuckin stomach,where you came from...every fuckin day i see your fuckin posts,and it frustrates us damnit.SO QUIT BEING A FUCKIN RETARDED FUCKTARD,AND GIVE CREDIT!

Sincerely,

SimDude;-)

Have a bitchin day"

thanks 4X ;);)"
,4X-AXG,2007-07-15T12:16Z,"haha SimDude you are one funny son of a bitch, the more it frustrates you the better :D"
,4X-AXG,2007-07-15T12:20Z,"but let me explain something to you SimDude and your fellow Wings of Shit assholes. You guys blocked me from WoS without any reason. You are the ones that pissed me off. And that is fine, I do not need you. But you pissed me off and I will do anything to piss you off. You started this, not me.

oh and by the way..who says I got this from Wings of Shit? I am blocked there remember? how can I download shit from there when I am blocked? now go back to your Wings of Shit and kiss the boss his ass, cuz that is all what you guys seem to do lately"
,Baster23,2007-07-15T13:03Z,"THX 4X !!

but what is Wings of Shit ??"
,eNuffSaid,2007-07-15T13:49Z,"Wings of Shit = Wings of Silence @ www.fs2004.info

Don't want to meddle in this discussion. All I want to add is that 4X is a fantastic supplier of MS FS addons. I am very appreciative of that.

This planet is full of thieves. Thieves at all levels. George Bush is a thief and we are thieves. If we steal we can expect to be stolen from us.

It's okay to steal from a software company, but meddle with a pirates credentials and the world comes to a fiery end...

huh?

,rocketbaby1,2007-07-15T14:29Z,"Hey Guys,

what´s wrong with you. I am only want  to ask, if someone could share my requested add-ons. 
I can not understand why someone getting agitate?!? ;-((
I am new here, you know"
,Panodilo,2007-07-15T15:29Z,"rocketbaby1, when you're new you have to go through the hierarchy the way everybody before you have. Right now you're 4X-AXG's bitch. If he commands, you must choke on his shaft. When you make a request, the potential uploader must be able to discern a highly obvious cum breath. It will let that person know that you're a team player, that you are ready to swallow one for the team. I have two wicker ware boxes full of DVDs, each crammed with addons for FS. It doesn't take Alan Greenspan or Stephen Hawking to figure out that I must have swallowed the pride of every sailor in the Nato alliance to acquire them."
,4X-AXG,2007-07-15T15:53Z,"hahahaha holy christ and that was just another legendary answer from the legendary Panodilo

but okay rocketbaby, since you are new, I will try to explain

newbees do not get to request shit
leechers only do not get to request shit

you provide us with some good add-ons and then you might try to request some stuff. nothing worse than a leecher or a newbee (let alone a leecher AND a newbee) requesting shit.

so, basically, there are, at least for me, two rules:

1.  you thank people for their uploads before you request stuff
2. you upload your own shit before you request stuff

after a while, when you made a name for yourself, like Panodilo, PopArt, B744, Keyno, etc etc, THEN you get to request shit

hope this clarifies this a little bit

happy flyin'
4X"
,rocketbaby1,2007-07-15T21:53Z,"Hi A4-AXG,
