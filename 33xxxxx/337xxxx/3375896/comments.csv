,jaygriffen06,2007-02-11T08:06Z,"I rented reno 911 season 1 its 14 gigs total, you must not have everything or a dam good compressor, im uploading the real thing"
,Kev4000,2008-01-22T21:28Z,"jaygriffen, you must mean the DVD version. These are probably DivX and thus 1.96GBs makes sense."

,oohGOD,2008-05-29T22:53Z,"nice collection 
wish you could do the rest of it
ends at episode 11 like tcip wrote
still thanks for this

hope to see season 3,4,5 sets soon "
,djTeka,2008-06-07T08:07Z,"Well, since this is the only Reno911 download marked Season 1, I'm going to get it. 
If you have the rest of the episodes, then put it up in a complete torrent, and put it up here.
I might just buy the DVD, but then there isn't the ""What did they just say?"" bleeping, which I think adds more comedy to it.
Like in a scary movie, sometimes the things you can't see are scarier compared to the things you can see."
,djTeka,2008-06-07T08:10Z,"Still waiting on ""jaygriffen06"" to upload the real thing. 
Like they said they would. 
More than 2 years ago.
