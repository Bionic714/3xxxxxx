,ReVIsed,2005-08-16T01:23Z,I see you already did. Too stupid to die eh?
,Stitchz,2005-08-17T05:55Z,"I know a man who beat terminal cancer with 'quackery'.  A string of doctors basically told him to get his affairs in order and make his peace with God.  He fell back on a combination of homeopathic remedies, diet, and exercise.  His doctors said he'd just make it worse and if he wasn't going to accept it he'd be hurting his family with false hope.  A year and a half later his cancer was in full remission and today over a decade later he's had no signs of having had any type of cancer.  It's things like this and my own experiences with mainstream medical care that make me open to at least the suggestion of alternative practices."
,Profi007,2005-08-17T23:13Z,"This was interesting to watch, but unfortunately just a lot of -------- propaganda.

When was this made anyway? Sometime in the 1970's I guess.

Laetrile aka amygdalin is a hoaks. Read this if in doubt:

Even placebo works better than this!

Watch some Penn & Teller shows. There's a lot of bullshit floating around ;-)"
,neonreach,2006-07-13T11:47Z,"Don't dismiss B17 to easily.

My wife was diagnosed with non-hodgkins lymphoma three years ago...major surgery for confirming biopsy.

Included B17 in a nutritional approach including all 'essential nutrients' and is now symptom free and all investigations are clear.

Quackwatch is not right about everything!"

,theblackbay,2006-07-29T17:09Z,"I can confirm all the major points of this documentary, and independent  analysis of the same basic methods and principals of the natural process was conducted by a UK team of physicians and the result was confirm , it works. further funding is pending.

To anyone calling this documentary ?bullshit? or ?tripe? maybe you?re a prime candidate for a control in any further experiments.

You can be active in trying to gain cancer  I recommend three diet cokes a day, and as much toothpaste or any other form of saccharin and aspartame as possible.

,theblackbay,2006-07-29T17:09Z,"You may as well die  you serve no useful purpose on earth if you are so ignorant as to actively write a comment blanket calling scientific analysis ?tripe? with no further evidence to the contrary.

= you are stupid you will die - - then - - more educated people will live.

The universal balance"
,freshn81,2008-08-02T16:42Z,"this was interesting, but Laetrile is banned for a reason: it's fatal in high doses. I don't think it has much real benefit. Regardless, thanks for the upload and discussion!"
,fan666inhell,2009-11-13T05:33Z,"thanx! 

you should check out what some say about the effects of thc and vitamin d on cancer."
,capturetwist,2011-02-14T16:35Z,"Thank you for your torrent which it is still alive.  Kindly ask the promoters of quackwatch to stop their ignorant crusade on natural therapies.
I am one survivor of  traditional therapy thanks to alternative therapy, I am well and alive. They are not only wrong, but ignorant sheep followers.  Their curse it is to die at the expense of government therapies.  We who think for ourselves will live. Please follow your instinct it is never wrong."
,WilhelmTHE3rd,2012-07-23T14:29Z,"Might I ask capture, who diagnosed you? Did you seek traditional treatment alongside alternative treatment?

If you're presenting yourself as proof of cure, it's only fair to offer a little more evidence to evaluate your claim.  Even if your an honest person, certainly not everyone is."
,WilhelmTHE3rd,2012-07-23T14:37Z,"Take the case of someone with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, which covers a lot of different types of cancer but is often very treatable although no doctor would be optomistic until a biopsy is performed.

Many patients with that diagnosis will be essentially cured by a lumpectomy, wherein most of the tumor tissue is removed.  In many cases this will be performed at the same time as the biopsy to avoid two surgeries. 

In this example, someone may then seek alternative treatments and become convinced that cured them when the surgery is almost certainly what saved their lives. "
