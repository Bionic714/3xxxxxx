,daweinst,2006-02-16T02:04Z,Don't bother downloading this ISO. It simply doesn't work. shady78 needs to check his stuff before uploading.

,parlancex,2006-03-31T02:02Z,"daweinst doesn't know what he's talking about because he's an idiot. It's an xbox iso, not a standard ISO, and isn't extractable using standard ISO tools. A little brains will help you find the correct xbox-specific iso tool to help you extract it."
,death9095,2011-05-13T03:56Z,@parlancex do you know anything or anyway to use the iso like specific programs that will run it? I really want this game I played it when I was younger and just want to play it again and have not been able to find it in any stores please some one tell me what will make it so I can play its. Please be specific I am not the sharpest tool in the shed :D
