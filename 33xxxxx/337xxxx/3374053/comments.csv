,idvi,2010-11-11T20:49Z,"'sound decompression not installed properly' or words to that effect. cant get it working on Windows 7 at all. Have tried both the official patch and compatibility modes (95/98/XP SP2)

Will have to keep this and try it on an xp machine soon. Will let everyone know what happens."
