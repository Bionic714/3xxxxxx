Thurston Moore - Psychic Hearts [1995/MP3/192]

Review by Heather Phares [AMG]

Moore's solo album is full of surprisingly straightforward and catchy (though definitely off-kilter) pop songs. The title track, "Queen Bee and Her Pals," "Patti Smith Math Scratch," and "Ono Soul" are hip, knowing tunes that capture the essence of Moore's songwriting. "Elegy for All the Dead Rock Stars" is a mesmerizing, epic guitar piece that closes the album on a beautiful and poignant note.
