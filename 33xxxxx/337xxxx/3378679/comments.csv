,Magic_shrOOm,2008-03-04T18:30Z,Is this working properly?
,Zinedin,2008-03-10T19:05Z,"526 MB? Are you crazy? This can't be it! I visited ReBirth Museum site (http://www.rebirthmuseum.com/) and as most of us know it by now, the latest version of ReBirth, the version 2.0.1 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReBirth) can be downloaded for free from ReBirth museum since Propellerhead has ceased developing the program in January 1999 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReBirth).

I first thought of downloading this torrent, since I would have to create a new account (which is free) at the Propellerhead website in order to download the ReBirth image file (ISO). But then again I thought perhaps it's faster or even safer to get it from ReBirth museum. So I signed up for a new account there. When I logged on to it and chose to download ReBirth image from the Download section I realised that the download there is distributed through Torrent as well. So I downloaded that torrent and added it to my uTorrent client. And guess what, it has already completed downloading while I speak. While this stupid torrent is still downloading and is at about 3.5% right now. So, which one is faster? It's just bull shit that it takes more time to download ReBirth from ReBirth museum.

WARNING! Oh, and by the way, the actual image file (ISO) is not over 500MB like this one. It's just over 200 MB (with mods, example songs and so on included). So I believe this crappy 500 MB file contains a lots of shit, perhaps even viruses and shit. Download it on your own risc. For riscfree download, download from the source! From Propellerhead website ReBirth Museum that is!

For those of you who don't feel like you want to create a new account at ReBirth Museum in order to download ReBirth 2.0.1 here is the direct link for the REAL ReBirth 2.0.1 image file:

http://81.92.66.41/torrents/rebirth_iso_installation.zip.torrent

And as you see, yes, it's an torrent file. So if you feel like you want to spread the word, download it and upload a new torrent for it here at Piratebay. I would do it myself right now but I'm not so familiar with how to create and upload a new torrent.

Peace out!"

,kidknapp,2009-01-01T16:37Z,"I have posted a new and legit copy of the .iso bundled with a pattern editor, the midi yoke, and all available mods and songs in one convenient torrent that will be continuously seeded by at least my two machines.

,PsiloKybel,2009-05-07T10:54Z,"@Zinedin: thanks for the good info's. :D 

I downed the ""iso_installation.zip"" (214mb), 
and it came at about 700kB/s on a 8/1 line.
(my former RB-338 II ""uncracked"" itself 
somehow and started asking for the CD) :)"
