This long-awaited, two video set was in the planning for 11 years!   On May 1 and May 2, 1996, Mike Caro -- one of the world's foremost authorities on poker strategy, psychology, and statistics -- and 63 poker notables, partipated in an historic, unpublicized, multiple-camera filming.  The result is this powerful full-color, scientific course that demonstrates how you can use your opponent's gestures, words, and body language to win all their money.  (1996) Editor note:  This is one of the most powerful and interesting poker videos that I have ever viewed.
