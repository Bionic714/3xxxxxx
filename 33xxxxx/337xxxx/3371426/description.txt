Sadly overlooked masterpiece from former Alice In Chains guitarist/singer. This is the FULL album (two CD:s) as was Jerry's wish, but record company "politics" prevented him from releasing it as a double CD the first time around. Anyway, eventually he got his will and the album was released as was intended.

I have included the video (.mpg) for Anger Rising which is on CD1 of the retail CD, as well as some artwork (unfortunately my scanner is getting mighty old so the quality might not be the best).

If you don't get this, chances are you probably just shouldn't be arsed by listening to music in the first place. Why not take up knitting, mountainbiking or aerobics?

For Layne Staley... see you when I get there, I hope you found peace.

Enjoy
