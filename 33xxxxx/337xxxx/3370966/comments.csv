,Ubbelover,2008-05-21T13:12Z,"Can somebody please explain to me how to burn these files to a DVD? :D

I've tried to convert the BIN-files into image-files using CD Burner XP Pro, and burning them with both that program and ImageBurn, but that didn't work... 

Thanks!!!"

,bongowolf,2009-09-28T23:57Z,"Hi, first I want to THANK YOU! for seeding this show - I just finished downloading it 100%. Again, many thanks!

Second - I have a big question: These download as BIN files.  I have no experience with this type of file.  Could you please tell me what program will open / convert this show to a video file?  (.avi, mpeg?)

As of right now - I AM TOTALLY LOST ON WHAT TO DO.  PLEASE POST SOME COMMENTS TELLING US WHAT TO DO / WHAT SOFTWARE TO USE TO CONVERT THIS BIN FILE TO A WATCHABLE VIDEO FILE.

You're terrific for posting this program - now, IF I COULD ONLY SEE IT!   :)"
,bongowolf,2009-09-29T01:32Z,"To Everybody!  

This file downloads as 2 separate BIN files (I know, I just did it).  You will need to convert these to a video file format to watch them.  

The Best Way:  Get the ""WinAVI Video Converter 8"".  You can find a lot of people offering this software here - it's a fast, 10 minute download (make sure you get it with a registration name & serial #).  Add the software to your PC or Mac.... then do the conversion from BIN format to DVD format.  That's all it takes.  The image is beautiful - Neilka - you did a GREAT job - many thanks!  

This is a wonderful show - show it to your friends but don't tell them ANYTHING about it.... and then watch how they get scared out of their wits!  A great Halloween show!"
,bongowolf,2009-09-29T05:52Z,"Whoops!  Sorry - one more comment needed.

The soundtrack is out of synch with the picture. If you download this, you'll get a great image & a fine audio . . . but you better be good with sound editing software, because you'll need to re-synch the audio to the actors talking.  Words are said a second before you see the actors actual say the words on film.  "
,ADaemonIsBorn,2012-02-12T14:04Z,"This file as well as the other ""Ghostwatch"" torrents on PB are either unseeded or out of sync. I've found a working avi file on Kickass Torrents:
