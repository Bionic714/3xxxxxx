This is probably the best sound quality in a live show I remember seeing, ever.  I almost think some of the guitars must have been overdubbed because sometimes it sounds a little "too good" to be live.  Priest plays all their early hits.  If you haven't seen them, or are going to this summer, check this out!  They're on tour now, with the original lineup seen in this video!  These guys showed in 1986 what a metal show was all about, and they're still going nearly 20 years later!  Enjoy!

My first DVD rip to XviD and I'm very surprised at the quality.  Looks and sounds great!  The video is from 1986, so it wasn't high-def or anything.  The DVD didn;t look much better to begin with.
