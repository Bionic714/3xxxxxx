"I found these extracts on an old cassette while searching for something else. The first clip is a brief, truncated recording of the bulletin broadcast after the second plane hit. The second clip is the Radio Four News at Six for the day, in full. This recording reflects the practical and emotional impact upon those tasked with providing coverage in the aftermath of the day's events."
