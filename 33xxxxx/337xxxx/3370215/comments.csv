,Catee,2008-04-04T07:21Z,"To answer ep question:

There are *two* shows called ""Conspiracies"", this one on Discovery & BBC & one on UK's Sky Channel that is hosted by Danny Wallace.  According to my info this one ran one season only in 2001 with 13 episodes.  Those eps are as follows:

1. The New World Order
2. Aliens
3. The Spying Game
4. Government Cover-Ups
5. Satanic Panic
6. Iconic Death
7. Hidden Places
8. Big Brother
9. American Presidents
10. Body Panic
11. Outer Space Hoax
12. Green Science
13. Rock 'n' Roll Deaths

If anyone has any updated info or corrections please add!

Cheers!"
