For its first time at the starting line, developer Codemasters is proving it deserves its name with TOCA Race Driver 2 on the PlayStation Portable. Due out in Europe for the European PSP launch (along with its dirty buddy, Colin McRae Rally 2005) on September 1st, the PSP version of the racing game will feature wireless gameplay for up to 12 racers, as well as a unique custom soundtrack feature.



At 12 players wirelessly connected (via ad-hoc, no online unfortunately), TOCA Race Driver 2 features the highest multiplayer cap so far on the system. The PSP is capable of up to 16 player connectivity, but technical and design choices have so far left developers maxed at eight players. A total of 21 racecars will be on the track at once, so this comes just short of maximizing the PSP's wireless abilities in filling the field of racers, but is another step up towards maxing the system's technical abilities.



In addition to the multiplayer abilities, Codemasters also announced that it is utilizing the ability to read music from the PSP's Memory Stick for custom soundtrack playback in TOCA 2. The feature does not seem to be able to play just any tune that you have saved (likely because of memory constraints or other technical reasons), but a free converter called Exact Audio Copy utility will be made available sometime before September 1st to change your songs into a compatible audio format. The game will allow you to make your own playlist from the compatible music files to listen to a whole range of songs while playing the game.



Codemasters has curiously not announced the release of either TOCA Race Driver 2 or Colin McRae Rally 2005 in North America, and representatives for the company were unsure last time we talked with them whether the games would be released here at all. Import buyers and Euro gamers can get their hands on these PSP games when they release in Europe on September 1st.
