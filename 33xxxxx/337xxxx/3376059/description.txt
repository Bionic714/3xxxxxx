 |    Just to give you an idea..this is an Arcade   |
 |    Type Shooter, FPS Genre, You can play this    |
 |    game with your mouse to aim & shoot but       |

 |    more realistic i guess..although still fun    |
 |    to play just by using a mouse..so don't let   |
 |    that put you off..even if the blood thursty   |
 |    drulling zombies do..prepare to be scared!..  |
