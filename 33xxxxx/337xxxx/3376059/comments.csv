,Zatur,2006-02-27T14:32Z,Thank you!!
,Zatur,2006-02-28T20:16Z,"This isnt the game im looking for, though it looks much like it.
The game i wanted was ""Typing of the Dead"" a game for typing training in a funny way.
If you want to get faster writing on your keyboard, Typing of the Dead is the right way to go."
