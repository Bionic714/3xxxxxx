PLEASE SEED"
,braysen,2009-07-25T19:04Z,"I've been DLing this for over a month, and I'm at 99.8%. PLEASE SEED!! You can't get this in stores in the US, so this is the only way to get it. Please don't make us miss out!

From what I've seen: quality is 10/10. Great job! :)"
,braysen,2009-07-28T00:24Z,"Correction: a few stores have it (must've just put it out), but why bother, right? lol

DL finished. Seeding now. If you get it, please seed it!"
