Episode 3 CHURCHILL v STALIN

Churchill v Stalin examines the duel between the British and Russian leaders over what kind of Europe would emerge at the end of the war; a duel during which Roosevelt secretly intervened behind Churchill's back to decide the outcome.

Warlords is a major four-part history series which reveals an epic untold story of the Second World War: the inside story of the private psychological war waged by the four great 20th century warlords: Churchill, Hitler, Roosevelt and Stalin; told through their own contemporaneous words and the words of those who observed them at the time. While their nations fought a war of weapons, the warlords fought a psychological war of the mind in which they lied, schemed, charmed, flattered and cheated to win. These psychological duels decided the strategy for the greatest battles in history. They were also the epicentre of a seismic shift in world power, from the age of European empires to the age of two ideologically opposed superpowers, with devastating consequences for hundreds of millions of people.
