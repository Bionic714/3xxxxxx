P.S: As i've just recently aquired UT2004 (dvd verson) and realized just how many of you are leechin' a copy for yourselfs. I thought i'd do you all a favor in return for giving me a copy! As some of you will already know, you won't be able to play UT2004 online, this is because either the serial key you enterd is already being used or the master server cannot be contacted.

This RAR pack contains not only the files you need for getting the game to work online, but also, every new map thats in circulation at the moment and a few extra's to help speed things up! 
(e.g: Bored of waiting at the start of a new onslaught, Deathmatch, Domonation, ....game? Then DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT!!)"

,Tom2MB,2005-08-16T18:16Z,"ALL the content (and the actual RAR itself) have been thoroughly checked for virus's and spyware. Everything in this pack has and is in use by not only myself, but by many of my clan mates (since they got it from me)

If you expirence any difficultys in trying to install, or have anyother comments/suggestions. Please don't hesitate to ask, either by this comments page, or by personal message to myself. Thankyou
