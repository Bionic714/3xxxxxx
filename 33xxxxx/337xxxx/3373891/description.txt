Mind blowing Middle Eastern psych from Turkey (1974) laced with exotic instruments electric and acoustic. Long tracks with exotic Arabic flavoured stylings recorded in superb stereo. Check out 'Korkulu Ruya' with it's freaked out backwards psychedelic guitars, Hammond keybords and treated vocals. A gem of an album.
