TTC - Rome and the Barbarians (new seed)

For those of you stuck at 87.4% or 87.5% in the other similar torrent download you can fix your current download by following the steps below:

1. Download this torrent file and start the download. Be sure to save this new download to a new folder and not the old "Rome and the Barbarians" folder that is stuck. 

2. Let the new torrent download run for a few seconds. Then stop the download.

3. Remove the torrent from the active download list. DO NOT DELETE the torrent or the data files.

4. Open your old "Rome and the Barbarians" folder, and COPY just the following type files:

    MP3
    JPG
    PDF

5.  Paste the copied files from the old folder with the stuck torrent to the new torrent "TTC - Rome and the Barbarians" folder. Overwrite the files in the new folder.

6. Reload the new "TTC - Rome and the Barbarians" torrent file to your bit torrent client program. The client program should now check all the copied files and will be ready to download when you connect.

NOTE: Because the files stored in your old download cache won't be copied you'll lose about 10% of the download of the stuck torrent. You should start without problems at about 75% complete. 

I followed these steps and managed to complete the stuck download after waiting a week for someone to start seeding again. I managed to find a new active torrent of the same files (except for the text files). Not wanting to start all over I came up with the above proceedure and it worked for me.
