,LimeJet,2008-07-21T02:54Z,Are the menus still there?
,SebZ-MBN,2008-09-22T11:29Z,"TokiWartooth - The quality is actually very good!
The videos averages out at about 752.01kbps (or at least that's what quicktime tells me) but the audio is 121.78kbps.
I would have preferred it to be encoded in x264 but it's still good!

LimeJet - Huh?"

,occollegeboi420,2009-04-12T00:51Z,The subtitles for this suck more dick than I would even if I were surrounded by 100 naked men.  I have a friend who is deaf and so u should have made the subtitles way better.  A lot of the script of the movie is not even included in the subs. video quality is good though.
