WELL YOU'RE NEARLY THERE, THE FINAL TWO EPISODES OF SEASON ONE....
I'D LIKE TO SAY A SPECIAL THANKS TO ALL THOSE WHO HAVE HELPED TO SEED THESE OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS, I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU.
AND A SPECIAL MESSAGE TO EVERYONE ELSE WHO DOESN'T SHARE, YOU ARSEHOLES MAKE ME SICK, AND I'VE GOT NO DOUBT THAT SOON ENOUGH THERE WILL BE A BIT TORRENT PROGRAM OR WHEN BIT TORRENT DIES SOME OTHER SORT OF PROGRAM TO STOP WANKERS LIKE YOU FROM BEING ABLE TO DOWNLOAD WITHOUT SHARING, THAT WILL AUTOMATICALLY DETECT YOUR CONNECTION SPEED AND IF YOU DON'T SHARE ENOUGH WILL STOP YOU FROM COMPLETING THE FILE, THEN YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND MAKE HUGE AMOUNTS OF PROFIT SELLING OTHER PEOPLES HARD WORK AND EFFORT, WITH OUT GIVING SOMETHING BACK TO THE TORRENTING COMMUNITY, UNTIL THAT DAY I HOPE YOU ALL DIE A SLOW AND PAINFUL DEATH, SO THAT THE ONES WHO DO UPLOAD, SEED AND SHARE FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES AND NOT JUST PROFIT PURPOSES CAN ENJOY GOOD SPEEDS AND GOOD ENVIRONMENTS, 
A ANOTHER SPECIAL MESSAGE FOR YOU CORPORATIONS OUT THERE
SONY
MGM
UNIVERSAL STUDIOS
ETC ETC.

IF YOU DIDN'T CHARGE £17.00 FOR A BLOODY DVD WHICH PROBABLY COSTS LESS THAN £0.20P TO MASS PRODUCE INCLUDING CASE AND ARTWORK THEN HARDWORKING PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS. ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING HALF THE FILMS YOU CHURN OUT ARE A LOAD OF SHITE. YOU WANT TO CUT PIRACY THEN TRY CHARGING £5.00 PER FILM, YOU ARE FIGHTING A LOSING BATTLE AND LONG MAY PIRATEBAY LIVE. 

ANOTHER MESSAGE TO TORRENT USERS IN GENERAL, BE CAREFUL WHICH TORRENT SITE YOU USE AS THE MPAA, RIA ETC ARE FORCING SITES TO GIVE UP EVERYONES IP ADDRESS, PIRATEBAY DOES NOT BREAK ANY LAWS SO CAN'T BE FORCED TO GIVE OUT IP ADRRESSES, USING PEER GUARDIAN ONLY HIDES AND STOPS THEM CONNECTING DIRECTLY TO YOU IT DOES NOT STOP OR HIDE IT FROM THE TORRENT SITE SO THEY WILL GET YOUR RECORDS IF YOU ARE NOT CAREFUL.

THAT SAID I MIGHT TRY MY HAND AT A MOVIE NEXT BUT NOT SURE WHAT PEOPLE PREFER 
MOVIE ONLY IN .AVI FORMAT (JUST LIKE THEY USED TO BE)
MOVIE ONLY IN DVD FORMAT
MOVIE AND EXTRAS IN DVD FORMAT

SUGGESTIONS AND COMMENTS WELCOME.
