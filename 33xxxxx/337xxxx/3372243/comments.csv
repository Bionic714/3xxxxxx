,zombiebloodfeast,2006-07-13T04:20Z,"More like the epitomy of what destroyed what the punk scene once was. Fuck the Ramones indeed, but I wouldnt boast this as being REAL punk. More like a half retarded bastard child.
I thouroughly enjoy the other 99% of what you release, so I guess I'll just shut my mouth"
,Bside_rarity,2007-01-31T09:16Z,"I'm in a GG phase...and no, he didn't ""help destroy"" punk rock.  He just wiped a little poo on it and rocked till he died.  Anyhow, nice ul."
