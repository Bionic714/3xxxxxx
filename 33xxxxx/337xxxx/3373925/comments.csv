,mashed,2006-04-03T20:44Z,"Gorbah:
The control scheme of the game isn't anywhere near as conveniant as their later games. You have to use a combination of keyboard and mouse in a somewhat awkward way (standard keys have you moving backwards and forwards with the mouse buttons, as well as a few other strange touches). As far as I know, you can't play with a gamepad, save if you play it on the XBox."

I think any problems you may have will be in your system itself or virtual drive operation setup etc.  Burning the cd i dont know i dont have a burner but can have 99 virtual drives act as any type of cd-dvd player, recorder, virtual burner!

And if programs dont work! its the uploaders fault as like the Fall-out 3! Download two types & both errors in the pre-hack..So bad job Fucks on that game..

This is how I did.

1. Use ISO to mount the file STAR_PotC_cd, and run the setup. By using ISO you don't have to Unrar the Winrar file to any Directory and save you some space and time.

2. During the installation it will ask you for the Cd 2. Use ISO to mount the STAR_PotC_cd2

3. When the installation is finished you go to the XTRAS Mapp that is in the Download map (Pirates of the Carribbean PC Eng) Open the XTRAS Mapp and then to the ""NOCD"" mapp.

Pirates of the Carribbean PC Eng - XTRAS - NOCD

The NOCD contains the crack files so you can later onmount the WinRar Archives files and then delete it (Saving space)

4.Now copy the files in the ""NOCD"" mapp and overwrite the XINTERFACE.dl where you can find in the installation files on one of your disk with the title ""BETHESDA SOFTWORKS"" -> POTC -> Then on to the MOUDLES. At the bottom of the mapp you will find the XINTERFACE.dl. (overwrite it)

That should do!

can anyone help please?"
,Torrentz4U,2011-12-10T04:43Z,"Right I have a solution to the engine.exe problem. do as ZumiRicsi said and go to http://www.fixya.com/support/t5751969-pirates_caribbean_engine_exe and download and install the program. Then when you have followed the instructions on the webpage, go to your installation directory for Pirates of the Caribbean, on mine its (C:/Programx86/bethesda softworks/Pirates of the Caribbean) and then click on configure. My screen resolution was set to 800x600-32bit and my computers a 64bit operating system so i changed it to 800x600-18bit and it worked. Hope this helped!!!!"
,maroonylife,2012-01-28T16:44Z,"WORKS on Win7 x64. Don't listen to other people telling you it doesn't work; either it's a driver issue or they don't know to do the crack properly. (You have to do the crack into the ""Moudles"" folder)

Thanks a lot for the great torrent, AWESOME GAME!"

 1-find game location mine is ""c:Program Files(x86)Bethesda SoftworksPirates of the Caribbean""
2-go to MODULES folder
3-copy XINTERFACE.dll from the torrent folder ""XTRASNOCD"" folder into the MODULES folder
