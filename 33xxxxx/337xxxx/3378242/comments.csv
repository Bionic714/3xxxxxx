,Drosselschlichte,2007-03-11T14:40Z,"Excellent image. Except that it is ripped from original 1993 USA/Canada release - it misses #9, ""Everybody Laughed But You"". Something goes wrong in those heads in A&M so they removed this track from US/Canada version without even asking the Sting himself.

It was restored in 1998 re-release but with different lyrics - the details are, as always, in Wikipedia.

(P.S. It does not affect the technical quality of the image in any way, but those in UK/Europe who dl'ed this may wonder, ""wth""...)"
