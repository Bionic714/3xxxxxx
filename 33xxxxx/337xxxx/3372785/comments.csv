LMAO!

One person was a relative to some illuminati people but that is the ONLY connection, and it was over 100 years ago.

Jehovas witnesses are not part of any political movement."
,pmsbull,2006-12-05T10:22Z,I know lots of Jehovah Witnesses and they freely share their beliefs with anyone who is interested. Its absurd to suggest that they are part of this stuff when they reject any political involvement and their Watchtower magazine printed articles based on bible prophecy that warns the rise of the Illuminati and false religions.
,Vietman,2007-07-08T17:24Z,This is not ridiculous...the heads of most major world religions are led by Illuminati moles. JW's are just another religion/cult. Why should they be immune to the Illuminati's infiltration?
,Markarian,2007-09-22T22:59Z,"JW zionist! ROFLMAO! They are hated by the Jews in Israel and in other country because they think they are anti-semitic, claiming that Jews no longer are Gods people! "
,sarabloom,2008-01-27T01:56Z,"Go read the ""New World Translation"" bible and repent!"
,NeoPirateX,2008-06-21T09:48Z,"If JW's reject all political envolvent, id like to hear you explain why they are an NGO with united nations ""the beast""...

good luck explaining that!!!!"
