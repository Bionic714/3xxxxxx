While little known and relatively unheralded during its brief existence, 
the Krautrock duo Neu! cast a large shadow over later generations of
musicians and served as a major influence on artists as diverse as 
David Bowie, Sonic Youth, Pere Ubu, Julian Cope, and Stereolab. 
Neu! formed in Düsseldorf, Germany, in 1971 after multi-instrumentalists 
Michael Rother and Klaus Dinger both split from Kraftwerk.

About "Neu! 75":
"This is music not only for traveling, from one place to the next, but also for disappearance 
into the ether at a steady pace." allmusic.com
