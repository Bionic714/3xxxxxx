Most excellent Krautrock from 1971. IF the band hadnt broken up after their first and only release they would no doubt have gone far. Andreas Scholz went on to play in the heavy progressive band Blackwater Park in 1971. Wolf-Rudiger Uhlig guested on Frumpy's third album, "By The Way" in 1972.

Named after a pipe tobacco (more surprisingly theres also a brand of coffee called Murphys blend ^_^), the Berlin group Murphy Blend were always quite a mystery. They were also a rarity in early German rock, as they combined the psychedelic Krautrock sound with heavy rock, blues and classical musics. 

Their music had hints of early Jane and Pell Mell, but apart from that they had a unique style, with a strongly accented vocalist, topical lyrics and heady instrumentals, heavily featuring chunky Hammond organ. Murphy Blend revealed a fine blend in which Uhlig utilised his keyboards to incorporate classical  themes into their heavy progressive music. He had studied classical music for three years in Berlin. The songs were melodic, textured by heavy guitar and organ riffs. The album contained six proper tracks (mostly written by Uhlig) and the shortest German song of all time: the 3/10 of a second long "Happiness"! .

Similar bands that I know of would be Tetragon, Blackwater Park, Virus, Gift, Birth Control & Lucifer's Friend etc.
