Classic CD (in my opinion) from Ian Thornley and co.
Very Soundgarden and Led Zeppelin influenced, with great slide guitar
and a certain commercial accessibility.
They released two CDs, then Ian moved on to form "Thornley".
I saw them open for Gov. Mule on this tour and they were incredible, 
they should have made it bigger than they did.
