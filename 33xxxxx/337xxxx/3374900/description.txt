Hawkwind album from 1978. Not their best known work, but not at all a bad album. Hawkwind had to change their name to Hawklords for legal reasons, maybe because Dave Brock was the only original member. 

After a brief respite, he and Calvert regrouped with a new rhythm section (Harvey Bainbridge on bass, Martin Griffin on drums), and a new name: The Sonic Assassins. Steve Swindells (ex-Pilot... "Oh ho ho it's magic, y'know, never believe it's not so.") then joined on keyboards and the name transmogrified yet again to: Hawklords. 

The 'lords recorded 25 YEARS ON with King and House fluttering about in the periphery contributing the odd bit here and the nice bit there. This is a challenging album -- the songwriting is strong and you have to commend Brock and Calvert for trying to move in a new direction, picking up some of the power pop/punk/new wave aura of the day.

Now if someone would upload pinkwind, Xhawkwind or the hawkestra bootleg it would really make my day :D
