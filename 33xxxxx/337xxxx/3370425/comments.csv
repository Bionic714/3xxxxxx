,bitye,2005-08-17T13:01Z,This is SuperPack? I think this is normal Plus! for XP!
,Weeze,2005-08-17T13:24Z,i think it's the superpack why you think it isn't?
,bitye,2005-08-18T01:49Z,Where is Digital MEdia Edition's options? Media Player PArty Mode and some?
,billymos,2006-01-03T14:31Z,"Is this in english, too?"
,Antrov,2006-03-13T19:34Z,"Yes, this is the normal Plus! version, NOT the Superpack (The official readme rtf file says so, and this has no Digital Media options, like dancers and partymode for example)."
,Antrov,2006-03-13T19:34Z,This download really SUCKS! I can't believe I've downloaded this crap! Download this if you're interested in pathetic games(the bowling one is a challenge for retarded) and a slower machine.. I'll uninstall this quickly..
,markxing,2007-01-23T02:06Z,Is this in English?
,salahzos,2007-02-02T12:24Z,It's not English. It's the Swahili version.. Enjoy
,iOSXPC,2011-08-26T15:06Z,"Very Good Work... This is english version.. All negative comments about this torrent are bullshit! This is the real deal... Thank You xfabrici0, for the wonderful torrent"
