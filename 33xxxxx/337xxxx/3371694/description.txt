What a weird cover coming from WarCry! It's like if we were brutally taken out a dream to face the real world. Have they decided to drop all signs of fantasy off their music?

Yes, this album is a bit different from the previous ones, and the greatest change is that it?s more heavy metal than power metal. There are almost no fast drumming passages in this album! But don't worry, it sounds 100% WarCry, and also 100% Víctor García. You'll find choruses to sing within every song, some very good riffs (the introduction of ?El Anticristo?) and a ballad, ?El Amor De Una Madre.? One of my favorite songs on this album is ?Tu Ausencia,? a cool heavy ballad with some jazzy and percussive background parts in a verse.

A quite catchy album I must say, though I've never really been a fan of WarCry because of two things: I find it not original enough and lacking conviction. This album is no exception. If you?re searching for something new I guess there are better albums to discover, but don?t be fooled by the name of the band: WarCry doesn?t play the kind of power metal you could expect from such a name. Of course if you like the band?s previous works then you'll love this ?¿ Dónde Está La Luz ??

Note that there?s a limited edition on sale, with a bonus DVD containing interviews and some shots from the recording sessions.
