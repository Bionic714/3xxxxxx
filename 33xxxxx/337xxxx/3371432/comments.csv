,sagiman69,2006-03-01T03:01Z,can't due to some signature problem help me please!!
,kurruption,2006-05-11T03:31Z,"im having a little problem with this, everytime i go to play the game i get one of those windows error reports. I've reinstalled this like 3 times already but with no luck at all. I use the No_CD crack and whatnot but still nothing. Any ideas on whats the problem and how i can fix it?"
,AKLightskull,2006-05-17T20:05Z,"Spent all night downloading this thing, thinking I was about to get an awesome game that I'd been anticipating for a while now. Problem is, the crack for it doesn't appear to be an actual crack, more like it's just something that translates the game to english. I couldn't even get the japanese version to run."
,TitanXs,2006-09-12T18:23Z,"I got it working easy, but just how do you get it to translate?"
,Laces13,2007-01-24T19:04Z,hey just finish downloading this game and unzipped it but it doesn't work.....can anyone help me?
,WolfEssence185,2007-02-06T19:19Z,I'm lost on how to play this game any help would be great.
,kPod,2007-06-08T11:47Z,"The translator is only the initial executable, allowing you to change detail levels, resolutions etc.

For those of you that are having a few problems, run it in a Window rather than Fullscreen. I had the same problem, and running it in a window solved it. Although, if you do that, you can't use anything behind the window. You have to quit the game to use anything else BUT the game (so no ALT+TABing will work.)"
,AlfyMasamune,2007-11-19T02:30Z,If your taking requests can you please get Bazooka Cafe.
,libra_in_red,2007-12-14T23:13Z,I downloaded this game and scanned it with anti-virus software and found a trojan embedded in the files! I would recommend anyone scanning this first before you try to install it!
,SmoothRKJ,2007-12-18T18:11Z,Well it might not work on XP if you don't install support for japanese in Control panel\Regional and Language Options. AND YOU NEED THE XP-CD TO BE ABLE TO INSTALL THE SUPPORT. If you don't have the CD you can probably find one here at TPB.
,GrotesqueArachnid,2008-01-27T00:09Z,"I'm having a slight problem with this game... After applying the crack (The translation), only like 5-8% of the game is translated, I can't understand any dialogue or choice I make in the game... Please help? :)

Jag har ett mindre problem här (Egentligen större)...
Efter ha lagt till cracket (Översättningen), bara ca 5-8% av spelet blir översatt, jag fattar inte ett jävla skit av dialogerna eller valen jag gör i spelet... Hjälp tack? :)"
,Rokua,2008-09-04T07:17Z,How do you apply the crack? I am using RecordNow! and it keeps pulling up the Program to burn the disc.
,Saidor,2008-11-30T00:49Z,You will include distribution please
,gravi_fan89,2009-03-20T22:14Z,"Hey, I've been trying to find a game for over a year now, and I've had little luck.  The copies I can find don't work, or are corrupted, or something, so I'm starting to get desparate.  The game is called ""The Maid's Story,"" it's for the PC, and (here's the kicker) it's a DOS game.  Please, if anyone has any information on this game, please let me know."
