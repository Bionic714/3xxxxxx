Yes it is, though the video quality is a bit lower then what I am used to, it is a VERY good DVD to test you 5.1 system with, it ranges from just talking, to being blasted away by your sub from explosions :)"
,Newbee01,2007-06-15T15:30Z,"Absolute Amazing DVD.  Get past the bunch of movie clips, or hit the DVD menu button on your remote and there is a bunch of DTS, Dolby Digital, and THX tracks.  I will definitely bring this DVD when ever I hook up anyones surround system!   THANKS YUSRIE great compilation! 

Great Download! Will seed for as long as I can! "
