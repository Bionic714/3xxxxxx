I have unpacked them but  how do i then watch them!??"
,JudoFreek,2006-08-06T03:05Z,Download AutoGK and then select the .IFO files as the input file and then select were you want the movie to go. Seeing as it seems high quality select 3CDs and use Xvid and make it an AVI format then click add job and then click start.
,JudoFreek,2006-08-06T03:06Z,Or just download VLC player and you can watch it.
