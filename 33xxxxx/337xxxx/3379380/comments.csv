,bauxiet,2008-08-01T12:27Z,Dank voor de muziek. Van het genre van throat singing ken ik wel de Tuva Rock van Yat-Kha. Misschien een tip voor geinteresseerden die zich breed interesseren voor het throat singing.

Learn why in Kyzyl they still call Paul ""The Thunderbolt."" And check out the music of his chief disciple, throatsinging bluesman Sean Augustus."
