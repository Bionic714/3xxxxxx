Shu De - Voices from the distant Steppe

Since the beginning of the 1990s, throat singing has been attracting the attention of a growing number of music lovers from all over the world, and in particular groups from the republic of Tuva, situated northwest of Mongolia. Shu-De is a group who presents this amazing music, alongside such groups as Huun-Huur-Tu and Chirgilchin. Throat singing is a technique that has been apparently developed in Mongolia which allows a singer to sing two or three notes at the same times. The people of Tuvan were able to develop five different ways of producing this particular type of singing.

Mikhail Alperin writes about this recording:
The story of this project has its own tiny prelude, to my mind a rather mysterious one, which I would like to share: Some time (Roughly?) about a year ago, I developed some kind of vision of a family where the father would be from Tuva, the mother Bulgarian, the daughter a Russian, and the son Jewish. The very idea might have been nothing more than a funny whim, but then, all of a sudden, I pictured this family as a musical one, not consisting of professional musicians, but a family where ... Then I didn't get any further with my vison. Instead, I startet collecting musical material and writing scores for some non-existing future project. These, then, would be the ingredients of the salad to come: The Bulgarian Women's Choir - "the mother", overtone singers from Tuva - "the father", The Moscow Art Trio, with the Russian soul of Sergei Starostin and my own Jewish melancholy, plus a blues singer of some category or other - the children of the peoples of the world. Luckily, at the time I wasn't about to think of it as a concrete, pre-programmed plan. I was just playing with the idea. That family, however, started to live its own more specific life, even if only on paper. Having spent a week writing out some of the compositions I realized that all of this was just a dream and as dreams have a tendency to dissolve and create disillution I figured I would have to come to terms with that. In my embittered mind, dream and reality seemed to collide head on, until one day the producer, Uli Balss, of JARO, Germany, phoned me unexpectedly to suggest that we work on two disks with my Moscow Art Trio and subsequently the "Bulgarian-Tuvan project" of which we had been dreaming, not he, strange as it may seem. Needless to say, I immediatly hurled myself at the task. Some dreams do come true. But in any family problems arose, and some specific ones did show up in "mine". During recording sessions for my disk, Prayer (with members of a Russian folklore choir - JARO 4193-2) one of the Russian female singers suddenly stopped singing and left the studio as a sign of protest against what she held to be a too radical treatment of folkloristic material. Thus, I knew from that experience that the Bulgarian-Tuvan project would require lengthy and emotionally demanding explanations on the phone of concepts unfamiliar to the various participants. And even when the choir finally got their scores, work wasn't necessarily made easier. Unexplored musical ideas kept knocking especially forcefully on the door of the "mothers", who generally tend to prefer what is familiar. The "fathers" in far-away Tuva smoked their tobacco and sipped their vodka, shaking their heads in astonished patience, whereas their Russian "son", following his people's tradition, preferred not to brood too much about the future. Now, a few words about the project itself - about the music you'll hear on this disk. For a long time I had been studying the common denominator of meditative structures in various folkloristic forms of expression, for instance the Russian tradition of lengthy songs with their characteristically brooding melancholy. Actually, a similar mood might be found in Tuvan songs of the steppe, and is also reflected in the the musical landscape of folk songs from the Radopi region in Bulgaria, as well as in many Jewish songs, filled as they are with that very same stillness and affection. That's why, in the beginning, I named the project "Meditation" as a working title - in an attempt to stay away from any "modernization" of folk song themes, but instead unite different folkloristic sources in the vision of a bird's flight. 

Should I try to capture in words the essence of what I have tried to do here, I would do so in terms of a small scene that got stuck in my mind: I remember en elderly couple dressed in black on a small island in Greece. They were looking out across the sea, into the distance, motionless, and time stood still. I liked the way our experiment ended. During rehearsals, singers who had never seen each other before and were at first glance utterly remote from each other as far as cultural roots are concerned, began suddenly and spontaneously to perform their forefathers' songs for their "alien" colleages, as though discovering this possibility for themselves right then and there. Each began to pick up intonations, modes, and moods of songs stemming from seemingly infinitely distant areas. The family were coming together, getting to know each other as though after centuries of separation. That in itself was enough for me to be satisfied with the final product.

Tuvan throat singing might well be the next craze in world music: exotic enough to interest, yet still accessible to western ears. Huun-Huur-Tu have a style that's less westernized than others (like Ondar) performing in this tradition today. The best tracks on "Where Young Grass Grows" are the more authentic ones, even including two performed on horesback! The pentatonic melody lines, pipes, and strings should appeal to fans of Celtic music.

They're not likely to be found singing "Tumbling Tumbleweeds," even 
though that plant hails from their country, but the Tuvans are having 
an impact on the rest of the world when it comes to their music. 
Tuvan throat-singing, a fascinating style in which a single vocalist 
can produce a haunting four-part harmony, has turned up on Ry Cooder's 
film soundtracks and as part of the style of bluesman Paul "Earthquake" 
Pena, while concerts by groups such as Huun-Huur-Tu continue to be 
extremely popular. This compilation, produced and annotated by Ralph 
Leighton, brings together traditional and contemporary Tuvan music, 
opening with a demonstrative medley from Kongar-Ool Ondar and closing 
with a duet between Ondar and Pena. The text, meanwhile, provides a 
glimpse into the history and culture of Tannu Tuva, with translations 
of Tuvan stories and poetry as an added bonus. To cap things off, 
this is all presented as a miniature hardcover book with attractive 
coffee-table design ? a typically excellent Ellipsis Arts presentation.

Sainkho Namchylak is one of the more important singers to come from the former Soviet sphere. Born and raised in Tuva, trained in music but denied credentials, she eventually went to Moscow to seek out the modern world. She studied modern composition, ancient folk traditions, and the art of multi-tonal "throat singing." As a member of the infamous avant garde ensemble Tri-O, she broke most of the rules and started to make a name for herself in the world of "new" music. Naked Spirit is her most complete work yet, as she explores jazz, classicism, shamanistic depth, and completely unfettered experiments--always centered around the voice, often layers and layers of her own voice. This is accompanied sparingly; a solo piano, a wailing dudek, a throbbing mouth harp, and a single drum are used to add color or texture to the vocal music. While Sainkho is often relegated to the "world music" bins usually reserved for folk and pop fusions of folk, she really belongs in the section devoted to free jazz and experimentations by artists like Meredith Monk or Rinde Eckert. This music is defiantly unclassifiable and all the more important for that defiance. --Louis Gibson

A mainstay of the NY Downtown scene, Rothernberg's multi-instrumentalism has ben honed in collaboration with Zorn, Braxton, Sharp, and Frith. Sainkho Namchylak's careers has been equally illustrious: a singer with a 7-octave range, she has established herself globally equally as a composer and performer of avante garde and traditional Tuvan singing. Together they form an electrifying duo with incredible range and musicianship.

This CD is the soundtrack to Nina Danino's movie Temenos, an impressionistic documentary on the Virgin Mary's alleged apparitions in Medjugorje (Bosnia). It features vocal performances by avant-garde improvisers Sainkho Namchylak and Shelley Hirsch and soprano Catherine Bott, with Danino narrating, Pavlo Beznosiuk on occasional hurdy-gurdy, and in situ recordings (birds, dogs, wind, children, pilgrims' testimonies). Each performer was recorded separately improvising solos and Danino later combined and arranged the tracks into the soundtrack presented here. The whole thing translates into an extended piece of audio art, a captivating blend of environmental sounds and vocal experimentations with narration, radio, and treated sounds adding colors here and there. Temenos is mainly a showcase for Sainkho Namchylak's incredible vocal capabilities, and the listener constantly comes back to the detailed program notes to check if the sounds are really derived from a human voice or if they are something else. The soundtrack stands nicely on its own and gains from being listened to with headphones in order to catch the quieter passages (the volume range is huge). Namchylak laughs, cries, moans, and drones in ways impossible to describe. The work is split into 22 tracks, but none of them could be taken out of its context; this is the kind of CD one must listen to in one sitting, attentively, with as little distraction and ambient noise as possible in order to be literally engulfed by the sonic tapestry. Then, and only then, will Temenos reveal its hidden beauty. For the most adventurous listeners only or those fascinated by the human voice.

Bob Tarte, All Music Guide
With their extraordinary harmonic-whistle vocal techniques, Tuvans could well be the next sampling craze. From the Central Asian country reputedly settled by the descendants of Genghis Khan, folk group Shu-de accompany songs derived from shamanistic rituals with instruments whose sounds are as irreproducible as the vocals, including two-stringed igil fiddle and doshpuluur lute, a particularly articulate khomus jaw's harp, and a variety of drums and rattles. The wildness of these songs evokes centuries of accommodation to a demanding landscape, but tongue-twister "Durgen Chugaa" goes even further to verify prehistoric associations with a Popeye the Sailor cult.
