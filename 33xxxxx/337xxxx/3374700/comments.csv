,huggums537,2009-11-22T04:19Z,"Does this include all of the same comics that are available on the website?

Also, does it include the 3 comics that were only released with the book and not on the website?"

but the files are not well organized, and its not the complete book set
JUST FOR THE RECORD"
,huggums537,2011-11-04T10:37Z,It totally sucks! I agree with lordmajd because the set is incomplete and not organized in order at all.
,huggums537,2011-11-05T10:57Z,You can get a fully complete and organized collection set here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6796806/The_Matrix_Comics
