For all those who've watched the anime Wind - A Breath of Heart in English fansub know this: There is no English fansubs of these four very important episodes. Without these four the anime is okay-goodish. With these four the anime is, IMHO, goodish-godly. If you need a number scale for that, it's 7 before and 9 after.

Here it is: episodes 9.5, 10.4, 10.8, and 12.4. There's a .avi file using direct sub, which might turn out to be raw after you downloaded it. Because of that I also include the 4 episode again in .rmvb file. Both subs are in CHINESE (that's the only kind of sub for these 4 episodes I can get on eMule  ). But you still must have them. Also, after you've got them, please tell some anime fansubbers to sub them. Just turn off the direct sub and it becomes raw, or you might have downloaded it as raw iunno.
