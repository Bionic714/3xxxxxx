ZOombug"
,PrEzEs3,2006-04-26T13:07Z,"Burn this image file with a burning program like Nero or Alcohol, or mount as virtual drive with f.e. Daemon Tools or Alcohol"
,ktrasler,2006-11-20T22:36Z,"I have alcohol but can't seem to install this game.

The torrent downloaded and I have 4 files

vp3p3099 - Application
VPOOL3.ccd
VPOOL3.img
VPOOL3.sub

When in alcohol I select Image Burning Wizard, the only file that appears is the .ccd file, and when I click next it says

Unrecognized file format for recording.
Please insert a recognized file format for recording.

What am I doing wrong.

Cheers

Kev."
