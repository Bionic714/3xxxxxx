Will convert rmvb and the others, but only to VCD, DVD, SVCD, Mpeg1 or Mpeg2.
ie: - don't expect control over video or audio that WinMPG Video Convert can do. Still, WinMPG stuffs up sound coordination with rmvb files."
,hellonewman,2006-06-30T10:25Z,"Further to above, my 123 meg rmvb was blown out to a 1.2 gig file. More importantly, the audio was out of sync. Seems Real Media are again at it trying to be the dominant force with their spy/ad/mal ware infested software. 

Back to looking for an updated version of WinMPG Video Convert."
