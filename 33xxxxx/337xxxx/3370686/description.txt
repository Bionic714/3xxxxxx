It's packed with 7-zip sfx if you don't use windows, http://www.7-zip.org/

PS. This is the same as Bonnis, http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3368884
But it was done wrong way, with over 1100 files unpacked, making sometimes problems with downloading (in my case under linux in azureus). Thats why i made this one, packed with 7-Zip, about 6 MB smaller, better for downloading and seeding.
Enjoy ^_^
