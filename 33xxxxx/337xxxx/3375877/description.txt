This is the featurette accompanying the film Lianna, a forthcoming upload here at Pirate Bay. Director John Sayles and producer Maggie Renzi speak of their film and short shots from the film are included.

I know a lot of people want full dvds in one torrent but, really, this featurette would add another 500 MB to an already large torrent, why I have decided to upload the featurette separately as a good quality 75 MB DivX/avi file. This way, you can have it all. Also, this featurette can serve as a preview for those of you not sure if you'll want the film.

You can, of course, convert it to dvd files using a program like WinAVI Converter and compile it with the main feature. But the film will be one of my largest files so far (6500 MB); so combining them will reduce image quality further, in the case you will want to burn Lianna onto a single 4.7 GB dvdr. 

Running time: 9 minutes.
Format: Home Theatre-certified DivX avi.
