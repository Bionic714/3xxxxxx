Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition provides automated virus and spyware protection for workstations and network servers to maximize enterprise-wide system uptime. Centralized configuration, deployment, alerting, and logging enables administrators to manage the network to determine which nodes are vulnerable to virus attacks. Integrated response content from the leader in information security helps organizations maximize uptime, reduce cost of ownership, and ensure the integrity of their data. 

Real-time protection reduces the risk of spyware and adware reaching the system, while automatic removal enables easy disposal of security risks. Side-effect repair automatically cleans up registry entries, files, and load points after hard-to-find spyware infections. Administrators have the flexibility to set their own security spyware and adware policies on an application-by-application basis, and gain maximum control over protection settings via the existing Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition management interface. Enhanced tamper protection guards all processes and registry entries from unauthorized access and attacks. 

Potential virus threats are automatically submitted for analysis to Symantec Security Response, which provides repair and response content. A forensic tracing feature helps administrators determine the source of blended threats that spread through open file shares. Advanced behavior blocking prevents client systems from being used for malicious outbound activities, such as sending worms via email. LiveUpdate(TM) technology provides a single update to protect the enterprise from viruses, malware, and spyware. Client compliancy technology allows the administrator to ensure that mobile and remote systems connecting to corporate resources via VPN are compliant with security policies. Purchases must be for 10 or more to be elligible for volume licensing.
