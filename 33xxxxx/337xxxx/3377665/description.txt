Hi! This is tha PAL version of the great platformer Ape escape 2. Now listen up: Do NOT whine about seeding. I seed for about a week, then it's up to you. I don't seed at night either, but i'll dedicate the line for this and my videos, ok? But seed at least 2.0 or this torrent will die quickly. I pulled this one straight from my retail original. Nothing ripped. I've tested burning the iso(nero) and it works. Hi-quality covers included.
Have fun, it really is a kick-ass game.

Me out.
