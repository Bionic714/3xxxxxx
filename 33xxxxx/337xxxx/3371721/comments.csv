,englen,2006-03-01T17:13Z,"It's just plain old Quake1
Including GLQuake and Quakeworld i think, im no expert in Quake 1...

Absolutely no reason whatsoever that this release should be placed in the porn section... nothing even remotely sexy about it."
,sk4b,2006-04-25T05:01Z,"A. its in the Games section, it comes up in the searchs because i used naked as the description for quake, i should have named it bare bones, quake, but then people would have asked if it was just skeleton models."
