  Customization is key in Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2. In this release,

  players can create their own riders (or ride as BMX champ Dave Mirra,

  Ryan Nyquist, and others in an impressive posse of BMX pros), choose

  their own sponsors, and even design their own parks in which to

  complete a variety of challenges. As players progress through the

  game, they'll earn the respect of fellow riders. The ultimate,

  though, is to unseat Mirra himself as king of the BMX hill.



  * The only game that features 10 time world champion and 11 time

    X-Games champion, Dave Mirra. 



  * State of the art Park Editor lets you create your own BMX

    experience. 



  * A roster of 14 BMX pros exclusively including Dave Mirra, Ryan

    Nyquist, and Rick Moliterno. 



  * 8 massive levels, 4x bigger than before, for the very best in vert,

    dirt, street and park riding and all of Camp Woodward. 



  * Innovative S.I.K. trick system with the new grind, wall ride, manual

    and lip trick modifiers, lets you pull over 1500+ tricks. 



  * 10 super-competitive multiplayer games. 



  * Compete to earn more than 40 real-life BMX sponsors during your

    ProQuest experience. 



  * Killer soundtrack featuring: Ozzy Osbourne, The Cult, Methods of

    Mayhem and Godsmack 





  We tested this game on a developer XBOX, and it works.  Since there is

  no mod chip yet, we have no idea if this release will work on retail

  XBOXes when/if a mod comes out.  However, now that there is a release,

  a modchip developer will be inclined to get our releases to work, so

  we think a future mod will work with this release.



  If a game is small enough to be burned to a CD, you can burn it to 

  either a CD or DVD, at your option, using the same ISO file.  

  The Xbox does not use media checks like the PS2. 



  When burning to a CD, if your CD burning program has an option, 

  choose "MODE1/2048", exactly as if you were burning a PC CD-ROM.

  We recommend PrimoDVD for burning Xbox for both CD and DVD, but 

  all CD writing software besides Clone CD should work fine.



  From our experience, the retail Xbox can only read DVD-RW's

  and CD-RW's, so if you want to be sure that these will work

  with a future mod, we recommend burning them to Rewritable

  discs. We have heard reports of the retail Xbox reading some

  types of DVD-R discs, but we have been unable to verify this.
