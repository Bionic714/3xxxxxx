"Err, thanks John. Saturday Night after hours on Radio One. Hi, it's Pete Tong here with a red hot Essential Mix tonight, well they all are, but this is truly red hot! On our humble turn-tables over the next two hours is quite simply one of the World's greatest music producers. He was brought to the Worlds attention over ten years ago by an emerging record label called 'Mowax' and his first release, and epic called 'Influx', changed dance music forever. Since then he's been responsible for some of the greatest moments in electronic music, both under his own guise and as 'Uncle' with James Lavelle. His discography reads like a role of honour, some of the vast arrays of works include 'Introducing', 'What does your Sole look like?", "Science Fiction" and hi latest album, "The Private Press". He is DJ Shadow of course, and this is his headline Essential Mix."
