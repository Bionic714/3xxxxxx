,Jedemdo,2006-01-08T20:30Z,"I have problems to start this game.

I had downloaded it competely and extracted it with winrar.

Then I wanted to convert this xiso with Xfer to my xbox.
But i cannot start it... Xfer shows me that the xiso isn´t bigger then 180mbyte, but the extracted file is 5gig huge...

Anyone has got an idea or an alternativ program to extract xiso´s to xbox?

Thx"
