Catherine Deneuve is very, very good as eternal blood drinker MiriamBlaylock. Although it has never been acknowledged (as far as I know), thelook and behavior of her screen character is a "re-imagining" of DelphineSeyrig's peerless vampire Countess Bathory from Harry Kummel's 1971 classicDAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS.

David Bowie is superb as Deneve's not-so-immortal beloved and convinces usto emphasize with his condition (he is aging rapidly)
