Unlucky in love, beautiful Charlotte ?Charlie? Cantilini (Jennifer Lopez) has finally met the man of her dreams, Dr. Kevin Fields (Michael Vartan). There?s just one problem - his mother! Overbearing and controlling, not to mention volatile, Viola Fields (Jane Fonda) has recently been canned from her job as a star news anchor. Fearing she will lose her son?s affections as she has her career, Viola decides to break up the happy couple by becoming the world?s worst mother-in-law. Helping her with her crazy schemes is Viola?s long-time assistant, Ruby (Wanda Sykes). The gloves come off when Charlie finally decides to fight back and it looks like Viola has finally met her match. Scheduled for a mid-summer 2005 release, Monster-in-Law is directed by Legally Blonde?s Robert Luketic and marks Fonda?s return to the big screen after a 14-year absence.
