Planetary status report. 

The ship of fools we call Earth is losing the battle that mankind is fighting against it. Every second, of our every waking moment, everythings around us is being violently reorganised. The current system we are living in is heading for a collapse, due to our sick need to control every single aspect of the wild and free nature that surrounds us.
