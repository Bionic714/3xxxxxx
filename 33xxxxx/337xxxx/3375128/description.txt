Cheryl a young black woman working in a video store, is making a documentary about an obscure black actress from the 1930's. When she discovers that the actress (known as "The Watermelon Woman") had a white lesbian lover, Cheryl just happens to fall in love with a very cute white women herself!

Attacked by conservative Congressmen, winner of multiple audience awards in major film festivals, and lavishly praised by audiences for being charming and courageous, this startingly fresh debut is "a wonderfully inventive journey through the annals of film history, African American culture, dyke attitudes, race relations, and the mysteries of lesbian attraction. Did I mention this is a comedy, too?"

Ripped with DVD-Decrypter, didn't need to be shrunk.

Enjoy!
