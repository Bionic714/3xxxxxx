hmm?"
,Catalyst666,2006-01-26T10:00Z,"if you haven't figued out by now, this tracker is EXTREMELY over populated. don't expect to connect to the tracker on the first try, or even the 20th try."
,R4ym0nD,2006-01-26T21:53Z,Please seed :)
,chaostoy,2006-02-05T02:18Z,"I had not much of a problem getting this one, but I am kinda new at this and don't have all the tools ppl speak about. (yet) :) It seems it will work with the ""alochol 120%"" program though. Thanks simen_90! :D Now I just have to figure out how to create my own torrents to share with everyone!"
,jani_sweden,2006-02-07T18:06Z,please seed !!
[T],Distrance,2006-03-04T22:05Z,"Please,someone help me. I just downloaded this and used Alcohol to play it form the image.The installer appeared and said: 
THERE WAS AN ERROR STARTING THE WORMS ARMAGEDDON INSTALLER.
PLEASE CHECK THE CD
what now?"
[V],Davidow,2006-03-07T19:53Z,"Distrance, try using daemon instead."
,kakama5,2006-03-14T00:33Z,"I tried Daemon and Alcohal 120%- none work.  It shows the ""Preparing to Instal"" screen, then goes back to the desktop.  ???"
,Ecclesiarch,2006-03-17T22:25Z,??? den hittar inte exe filen?!
,Ecclesiarch,2006-03-18T10:29Z,wich file am i suposed to open with daemon tools?
,simen_90,2006-04-04T13:51Z,The ISO file of course =p
,TrustNobody,2006-04-04T16:23Z,How do you start the game in XP after the install?
,simen_90,2006-04-17T12:32Z,You find the place where worms were installed and click the worms icon... You must of course have the ISO mounted all the time since that works as you have a cd in one of you drives =)
,TrustNobody,2006-04-18T14:12Z,"Hmm, i can't see a worms icon in the install directory neither. Strange. I only see a ""Landgen"" icon and a ""HSBRCiv"" icon."
,MarchForward,2006-04-19T16:01Z,"I had the ""Installing Worms... and then returning to the desktop problem"" as well. I found that if you mount the ISO image in DaemonTools, explore the CD, right-click on setup.exe and set compatibility-mode to ""Windows 2000"" the installation works correctly."
,MarchForward,2006-04-19T16:02Z,Once the installation has completed don't forget to download and install the latest Team17 patch as I believe this fixes some XP compatibility issues
,Sentienel,2006-04-23T21:00Z,"I have an error when I start the install in daemon tools, C:WINDOWSSYSTEM32AUTOEXEC.NT"
,bakuryu_66,2006-05-16T08:19Z,can i burn this .iso with nero? or do i have to download daemon tools?

,Isomikko,2006-11-30T19:14Z,"I had too this ""returning to the desktop problem"" while trying to install worms. I turn off my firewall program (kerio) and then worms installed my computer. No problem..."
,Kebab_rullen,2007-01-18T00:22Z,Ive tried all of your tips but still i can't install i just return to deskop.. plz help?

,Z4rg0n,2007-03-19T15:38Z,Seeda snälla! går så otroligt segt :'(
,Raynmakr,2007-06-18T14:47Z,"Sorry to sound dumb, but isn't the ISO the contents of the RAR file?

I tried burning the files to a CD and I get the insert the cd error, so should I set the compatibility and try it again?"
,Raynmakr,2007-06-27T12:22Z,"Using PowerISO, that you can find a torrent for, works great."
,Ruben01,2007-10-19T16:04Z,Does Someone has a Crack for this game? I can't find in anywhere!
,Rsteed320,2008-10-08T07:52Z,"i've mounted the iso file in both daemon tools and alcohol 120% and both times ive changed the compatability to windows 2000, but it still just returns to the desktop....any ideas?"
,SorrowedAngel89,2008-12-01T01:41Z,"Come on people, seed! I'm stuck at 99.6% right now and I only have 1MB to go!"
,Marenghi,2009-05-07T20:20Z,Works perfectly and online with update. Anyone with any computer knowledge can get this working. Don't worry.
,cmxiGT2,2009-11-14T07:46Z,"got it; opened with winrar, installed it; when i try to open  it says it can't find the ""wa.exe"" file, can anyone help?, what next?"
,cmxiGT2,2009-11-14T08:25Z,"LISTEN, IT DOESN'T WORK AFTER 4 INSTALLS. IT ALWAYS SAYS, CAN'T FIND WA.EXE, FIRST I THOUGHT IT'S BECAUSE I DIDN'T INSTALL THE DIRECT X6, AFTER DONE THAT,  IT CANT FIND SOME DX DLL FILE, FUCK THIS.... GET IT FROM ANOTHER TORRENT"
,LukeManuel23,2010-02-15T18:13Z,"All you have to do is goto file hippo type in daemon tools and download latest version install it restart your computer 

Now run daemon tools it should show in the tool bar (windows xp) right click on the icon in toolbar click on virtual drive and then click on E: drive then clcik mount image goto the location where you downloaded worms and click/mount it 

Then simply run the setup and foolw the steps."
,LukeManuel23,2010-02-15T18:14Z,i do not have windows 7 or vista or any other SORRY!!!
,TimArmstrong123,2010-07-30T22:26Z,"Finally I got it to work.

This is what I did:

Download the torrent, than with daemon tools mount the image, the setup screen wil appear.
instal the game, then reboot you pc.
Now again mount the image, but now don`t choose setup.exe but look in the folder.
Here you see the file: setup.exe. copy paste this file in the map where you installed worms armageddon. your pc will ask to replace the existing file, choose YES.

now go to the map where you downloaded it, and open the folder patch and updates.
Run WA-update 3.6.28 and 3.6.29.

After that just go to programs, team 17 and click worms armageddon and it should work...."
,mcreed24,2010-12-25T03:18Z,Sorry but wtf...its says its an .ISO but its a RAR? So I extracted it after trying to mount it in Daemon Tools Lite and now it wont install grrrr.
,mickeypopa,2011-12-27T12:58Z,"Works fine, just download the latest patch and crack and you're good to go. Thanks for the upload simen_90. ;)
P.S. I tried joining the online lobby and it worked. It may not allow me to play, but so far looks good. Haven't had the time to test it out yet, but if there's any problems I'll post them here."
