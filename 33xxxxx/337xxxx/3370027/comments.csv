,beerandcheesecake,2005-08-15T20:55Z,"I'm a little skeptical of this torrent.  It says that it has 10 seeds, but nobody has seen it yet...

Can someone please comment on the quality of this torrent???"
,rainmaker2k,2005-08-15T21:59Z,The quality of this release is OK. But there are people walking in front of the screen once in a while.

,bmk1879,2005-08-16T02:37Z,"You're right Cleb, I got it working :D My problem was that I used WinISO to extract the files and it didn't work for some reason but when I used daemon tools to load the image and copy it to my PC it worked. Thx n(4)20 !"

,simps0n,2005-08-16T13:53Z,"no problems with extracting here, works fine, quality is pretty watchable for cam/ts. but in a little part of the movie you can here the sound of when a mobile phone is connecting/calling... that stuttering sound, anyway, nice release"

,ariapro141,2005-08-16T18:37Z,"downloaded fine, but I dont understand how to get this to work...could someone please give me some useful info?"
,maddcamel,2005-08-16T22:02Z,"Ok, to get this to work man first you need to go to http://www.isobuster.com/ and download IsoBuster 1.8 or whatever the new version is.  So once you install IsoBuster 1.8 and you got it working.  Then go to http://www.videohelp.com/forum/userguides/141726.php At this site it will show you step by step on how to use IsoBuster to extract the .mpg from that bin file that you have downloaded.  And if you have any other problems just drop me a line.  But that's the way I do it, hope it helps man!"
,maddcamel,2005-08-16T22:04Z,"Oh yeah, thanks n20 might not have been the best cam, but I saved some money on my going to the movies to watch that crap.  Thanks man, good looking out!"

,snipahx,2005-08-17T06:05Z,"well its downloading now, i usually FTp movies to my xbox and watch them from there. But this time i want to burn it to a DVD, i recently bought a dvd burner and some blank dvds. So can anyone tell me how to burn this..I heard you need a Video_TS and a Audio_TS folder..oir something. so if you could explain or get me a good tutorial thanks!"
,compiled,2005-08-17T09:23Z,Cue problems can be fixed. The location of the bin file that was entered in the cue file is wrong (atleast in the release I got). Just simply edit the cue file with notepad and change the first line to the correct name for the bin file.
