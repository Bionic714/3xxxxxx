'Gia', starring Angelina Jolie, is probably as interesting to heterosexuals as it is to homosexuals, which may set it apart from most of my uploads here at Pirate Bay. While this drama based on the life of supermodel Gia Curangi tells us that the greatest love of Gia's life was a woman, she also had heterosexual relationships, and she also experimented with less benevolent things available in abundance to celebrities (and perhaps to many others?).

It seems to me that HBO pictures to a greater degree than most drama and documentary film companies, keeps a high quality profile. This one certainly is a strong drama and I think Jolie does better here than in any other film in which I've seen her. But judge for yourselves.
