
I prefer this Scrabble game over "Scrabble Interactive 2005" which is also here on Pirate Bay. Ubisoft always manages to fuck up the interface, this game has a much better one. Though its AI is a couple of notches poorer (it really sucks at tactics), I think it's a more fitting choice for anyone who isn't an advanced tournament player. It gives better info and "analysis" and the mini-games are very useful for the novice/average player.
