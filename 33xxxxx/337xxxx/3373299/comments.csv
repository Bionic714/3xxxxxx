,hoofd,2006-05-27T12:20Z,"Mugison is very good, I just saw the film Little Trip To Heaven, where Mugison does the soundtrack (and does an excellent job). But could there be a possibility that this torrent can be seeded again? Thanx!"
,hatertot,2006-07-15T14:01Z,"Thank you very much to whoever decided to seed this..  Been trying to find this stuff for a LONG time..  Can't get this anywhere but again, my deepest thanks.

I'll continue to seed this for some time after I have completed the download."
,hatertot,2006-07-16T13:24Z,"err.. I kinda take back what I said because there's NO ONE seeding this..  I have almost all of it.. if anyone could PLEASE seed it that would be amazing.

Thanks."

,afturaftur,2007-12-12T01:18Z,"Nice to see someone ULed this. I'm DLing it even though I have all the albums, and will seed for quite some time if I'm able to get it all.

This guy is worth it. Being that he's not rich (and just had a kid this year) I'd ask you to go and support him buy buying his album(s) or seeing him at a paying concert near you; or otherwise support him as you see fit.

If you decide to buy one of his albums, please make sure to check by the RIAA Radar (google it) to make sure you don't buy one of the albums published by a RIAA affiliated company, as it will mean you are giving money to the people who want to shut down sites like TPB!

Share and enjoy!
