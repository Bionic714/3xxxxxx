It may be old news now, but I will keep seeding this for as long as I can to help spread the word.

Fuck."

Make no mistake - George Bush is another Hitler. 

Why the fuck is it America assasinates its good presidents and allows the horrible ones rise to power? "
,bualls macgee,2006-10-04T06:58Z,"While I understand and agree with the outrage over such an event, to blame the president is nothing short of being a simpleton. 

Do you people understand how government works at all?

Police abuses like this have been going on since long before Bush was in office, and have nothing to do with the office of president. If anything, you need to hold your state senators and representatives accountable.

Jesus, get your heads out of your asses and quit making yourselves sound like ignorant parrots. Learn how the system works, instead of automatcally blaming the figurehead of the national government. "
