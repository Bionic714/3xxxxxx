Ipswitch WS_FTP Server is an RFC 959/1123 compliant FTP server for
                       Windows NT/2000/XP that provides: 

       - Virtual host support (multiple logical hosts on a single 
         physical system). 
       - Ability to use users from a Windows NT/2000/XP or IMail Server
         (Ipswitch's mail server) user database.
       - Quota support per user.
       - Mapped shared directories (virtual folders) with permission 
         support.
       - Group support, add users to groups and set folder permissions
         by group.

       Ipswitch WS_FTP Server can be installed wherever needed, does not
           require expensive, dedicated hardware, and can run in the
       background on your PC. WS_FTP Server works with any 32-bit TCP/IP
         stack, such as those bundled with Windows NT/2000/XP. You can
          configure WS_FTP Server and start distributing files on your
                     network without any special training.
