,jcd281,2006-03-23T01:14Z,Please reseed.  I will keep it going!
,--Logan--,2006-03-30T16:16Z,So is this good quality then?
,Malebogia,2006-09-16T13:50Z,"What's with the audio problem? i can hear this loud buzzing sound, tried other players, got the codec buy nothing helps... :("
,violets,2006-09-19T03:22Z,"This video badly pixelates for me every few frames, and the sound warps a little bit, too.  I have the Ogg codecs, so I don't know what the problem is...  If anyone could help me out, I'd be eternally grateful!  It took forever for me just to get this downloaded."
