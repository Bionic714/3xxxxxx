Comments on recording

This one was hard work and it cost me some nerves... I have never been so close to the Vertigo stage (far right side) which was great but there were lots of security people all around me,
one right behind me (you can even hear him on the tape ;-) Especially during the first half of the show when it was not dark yet I had to change my postion a bit sometimes or even bend down in order not to be seen....

General comments

Screamers, karaokers and excessive clappers suck... just like ebay sellers.
