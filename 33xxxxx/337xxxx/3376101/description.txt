Tool drummer Danny Carey was in this band before Tool took off and got famous.  He still records and tours with them when he has time.  The live show may be required to appreciate them, but they put out solid hard rock/metal you can tell was honed in the 80's oldskool tradition.

I put this up for April Wine, LA Metal Chick!  Enjoy!
