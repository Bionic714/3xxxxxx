(UNTIL they are CRACKED)they bug your pc with worms and trojans- i hate you Steve Small!!! but i still can get your overpriced-software --;-)"
,Freightdog,2006-04-11T10:13Z,"Thanks for the PC-6 , it's great.

Can anyone help me get my paid for FSD C337 flying again. Apparently by installing a few ""free"" FSD aircraft from here it's disabled my licenced copy of the 337. Really appreciate any help, Thanks."
,yuca,2007-12-31T05:24Z,"I'm in the same situation as Freightdog.
I have a couple of FSD aircraft that I can't install because I downloaded the free 337 a while back and I never installed it. But for some reason the ""legal"" ones won't install now."
