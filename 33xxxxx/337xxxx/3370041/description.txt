This is the soundtrack from the 1975 Ken Russel movie. Its a sort of reworked version of the original Tommy album, with mixed results and critics and fans alike have generally given this the thumbs down. There are a couple of tunes here that you wont find anywhere else and you got a few stars contributing to various tracks; TIna Turner, Eric Clapton, Elton John, Jack Nicholson, Ann-Margret and Oliver Reed to name a few.  Now if only someone would have smacked Pete Townsend over the head until he decided to drop the synth on every god damn song this album would have been _a_lot_better_. 

Required listening if you want to call yourself a Who fan.
