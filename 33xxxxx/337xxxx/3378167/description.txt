READ THIS PLEASE

If you downloaded http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3251798 to 93,4% (or whatever % it stopped @...) You can resume it on this i belive IF YOU DO the following! (I think it works for all the clients)

Delete the files that didnt get to 100% 
Auoustic disc:
Cluds Rolling By
Old People
Smiling For
Street Prade
Summer Rain

Electric Disc:
How Do You Do
Long Distance Man
Better Than Before
Girl In Oslo



After this you can open the torrent (This torrent)
And point the DL to the bigbang folder like you did with the other torrent.

It should now download the last files (the files that wasnt completed)



The files are WMA since that's the format i had them in, and i didnt bother hasseling with them.. it's 192kbps like the Mp3s.

AND YOU BETTER SEED THE FILE AFTER YOU'VE DOWNLOADED IT, MY CONNECTION SUCKS ASS.

PIMP :P
