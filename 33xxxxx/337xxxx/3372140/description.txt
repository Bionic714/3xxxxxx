OK here's a nice Distillers post to help you get over the break up rumours, its one file i joined all together and includes the tracks listed below. I got this a long time ago on Suprnova and it was badly out of sync, so i fixed all that joined it and here it is, enjoy!

Distillers - Live On TV 2003 SVCD 37m

The Distillers - 6 Tracks Live Slims San Francisco 20th December 2003 SVCD 
The Distillers - 2 Tracks Live On Later With Jools Holland BBC TV SVCD
The Distillers - The Hunger Promo Video

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. This will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install. http://www.videolan.org/
