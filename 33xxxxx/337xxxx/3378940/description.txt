Resizer for borders of print for Canon Pixma 3000 and 4000 (maybe more) so that it gets possible to use ALL the surface of a printable CD / DVD when printing on the disk. The original program dosn't allow a centerprint closer than app. 33 mm. This one allows it just as you want. You only need to use it when you want to change print-area outside (118 to 15 mm) that allowed form normal area (118 to 33 mm). Great little extra program to make your CD/DVD's perfect.
