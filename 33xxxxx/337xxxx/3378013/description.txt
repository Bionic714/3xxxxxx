Plot : In this little Provencal village, a new baker, Aimable, settles down. His wife Aurelie is much younger than him, and beautiful. She departs with a shepherd the night after Aimable produced his first breads. Aimable is so afflicted he can not work anymore. Therefore, the villagers, who initially laughed at his cuckoldry, take the matter very seriously (they want the bread) and organize to find Aurelie and bring her back to the bakery.
