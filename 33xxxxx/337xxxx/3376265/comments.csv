[T],FatFreddy475,2006-04-07T12:06Z,Enig der. Seed please :/
,Vinterpelsen,2006-12-05T14:11Z,"i've started reseeding now and will do so for a while. you should have no problems with the albums and singles, but i have a problem with this torrent. For some strange reason i seem to have one broken file, so the torrent isn't complete. If you check your torrent details and choose never to download ""/Seigmen - live at roskilde 98/01 - Opelwerk.mp3"", the rest of the torrent should be ok. I can upload a torrent with only this song later if anyone wants me to."
,Vinterpelsen,2006-12-07T23:35Z,i know the counter says there's noone seeding. that's because i'm not seeding the whole thing. (see above)
