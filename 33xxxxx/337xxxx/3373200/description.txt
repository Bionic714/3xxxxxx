This was Alexandro Jodorowsky's first feature film. It premiered at the Acapulco film festival in 1968, where the audience rioted and Jodorowsky had to flee for his life. It is a strange tale of a disabled women named Lis, and a man named Fando, who wander around a barren landscape trying to find the mystical city of Tar. On the way they meet some bizarre people, who try to abuse them.
