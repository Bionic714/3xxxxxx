,mrschillingjr,2007-02-27T04:06Z,Best virus protection is Kapersky.
,makenschi,2007-12-26T00:51Z,"""I know, I have the best ani-virus in the world""....
Oh, damn how many times have we not seen that?
How do anyone even know that?
Nod32
Panda Antivirus
F-Secure
This ""Kapersky"" some people mention...
Zonealarm
Norton
And so on....

According to the companies who sells the software, EVERYONE has the best!

Just a thought: How do you know which on is the best? A poll on a homepage with 10'000 answers? It can hardly prove it is the best. And you can't trust the propaganda from the company.

Anyone here who can tell me how you know which is the best anivirus. Please send me a message
aeon_eternity@hotmail.com
with a link to a homepage. Only the best is good for me, and I want to know, so I can change on my computer."

,johnkravin,2008-07-31T04:58Z,"this is how you tell if you have the best anti-virus 
1 do you have a virus 
if no then you have the best
and every one else can bite the fan belt"
