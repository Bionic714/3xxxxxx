,systemsmoke,2011-02-13T03:04Z,"I know this is an old torrent but just incase anyone can't get this running.
I got it working perfect in windows 7 64 bit.
Van_Gogh actually said how to get it working just install the game add the crack nosebleed patch wont work in 64 bit so go get the max_pack V1.14f patch here http://www.gamefront.com/files/6225634/TDR2000-MAX-Pack-v1.14f/ 
Use the max pack to start the game, also i have it running with hi-res pack with max all setting in advanced tab and it looks sweet for such an old game.
hope this helps anyone."
,stationmiek,2011-09-10T17:00Z,"It's like they took Carmageddon, improved the graphics, and then took all the gameplay out!

You have to race against the clock like Outrun, it's no fun."
