,itBme,2006-11-19T05:44Z,"This torrent has lasted a long time.  ;-)
Anyway, I wish some of the seeders would stick around when they finish.  It appears that there is an entire copy of this around but it is spread around many leachers.  I've been seeding this off and on for the last couple of months but I need the disk space.  I already burned it to DVD so I'll give it about a week or two until I delete it.  :(  Sorry guys."
