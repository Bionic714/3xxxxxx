I had a hard time searching for a good rip of this 4gb movie. Pirate Bay is the only place offering this good rip and from what I read all other rips were pretty cheap in quality."
,rrex,2006-08-17T06:12Z,"Sorry, maybe I have the wrong player, but how do I play the movie on a WinXP system?"
,Dave2887,2006-10-13T11:41Z,Its compressed using WinRAR
,ilchymis,2006-12-01T05:33Z,"Thanks! The quality's great. Unfortunately it's encapsulated with WinRAR (I won't say ""compressed"", because RARing an Xvid movie isn't going to make it any smaller). As I don't have the disk space to keep around both the extracted movie and the RAR files from the torrent, I won't be seeding this at all."
,Rickslick,2008-10-27T19:43Z,Thanx =)

,LunarHigh,2009-03-06T10:40Z,Wow. Never knew Steve Jobs was such an asshole. It's good to see he's mellowed out quite a bit.
,mmxbass,2009-03-17T01:23Z,Uhhh. No. Jobs is still a sociopathic asshole.
,elachim,2009-03-17T11:28Z,"thanks for up.

,edplane,2009-12-20T21:51Z,"Un-rar the .rar file, and it will make all the files into just 1 video file. You need StuffIt Expander or something to do that"

,RedReved,2011-04-05T16:56Z,"Thanks for the great movie! 
For all of you having trouble getting the files open, download WinRar if you don't have it, its free and extremely quick. Here's a virus free link you guys can try:
http://download.cnet.com/3001-2250_4-10007677.html?spi=6e0fba0930394c978ef490ba016ff8a6

if you have a 64 bit OS, then cancel download, and select 'WinRAR (64-bit)' in the additional download options.
Once downloaded, select the .rar file in the folder (ignore all the other files ending in .r##) and extract. Your file will then pop out at the bottom as an .avi file. All you have to do from there is seed and enjoy!"
