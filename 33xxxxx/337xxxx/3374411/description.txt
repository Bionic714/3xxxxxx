
Check out what I said about Scrabble Complete at http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3373890

The same goes for this version: it is newer, updated, and better. (It's by the same publisher, Infogrames changed its name to Atari.)

I have only tested the single player stuff though; the "online" part may or may not suck, but even without it, it's a great game with a very nice UI.

I'll stop seeding the other game and seed this one instead.
