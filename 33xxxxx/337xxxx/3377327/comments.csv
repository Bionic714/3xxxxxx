please help me "
,d.a.r.k.b.o.i,2007-12-29T02:44Z,"You can find seasons 1-3 on eMule in dual Spanish+English audio, but the queues suck.

I'd happily seed them if it wasn't for my connection. Seriously, on 256k up, it's quicker to get them off eMule.

And the Spanish audio track can be removed without transcoding using Avimux GUI.

As for seasons 4+5, there's torrents of them."
