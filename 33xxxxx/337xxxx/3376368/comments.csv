,jayblue,2006-01-04T16:12Z,"Hi, can't figure out how to use the patch. Anyone know how?"
[V],Erfa,2006-01-05T23:52Z,"The software works great, just read install.nfo if you have any problems. Just a question here. Anywhere to get swedish spell checking? I see they sell it on the web site, so I hope it's availible for download somewhere..."
,attackinghampster,2006-04-02T09:48Z,install.nfo does not work.  Crack does not work.  Cannot use program.  Be prepared to provide better help or don't post.
,willythekid,2006-05-05T18:59Z,"just tested the file, it works. Open install.nfo with Notepad instead of double-clicking it, and it will work. Then, just foll0ow the instructions."
,dbmata,2006-05-23T20:14Z,"pretty weak, hampster boy."
,notharry,2006-06-28T09:01Z,Works fine.  Thank you!!
,modpoetgod,2006-07-30T01:57Z,"followed instructions, but the response code given (in order to activate) is not working...can anyone help?  thx!"
,Milky Roxie,2006-09-02T16:41Z,"Hi ! Well, yeah, the response code is not available ?? What can I do ??? Please help !"
,JayPirat,2006-12-14T00:01Z,I have the same problem: the response code is not valid. Any advice?
,jerichowall,2007-01-09T05:13Z,The patch worked for me on the third or fourth try. Experiment with variations in the order of instructions in the install.nfo file.
,mrcrowley1999,2007-04-18T03:49Z,you need to have the final draft website open in explorer when you enter the final code. thats what did it for me.
,hdecker85,2007-04-26T08:46Z,Can anyone tell me what to use for the customer number required when opening the program for the first time?
,hdecker85,2007-04-26T09:10Z,"Ok, correction, what i need is to know how to activate it.  The response code given on the notepad is invalid.  What am i doing wrong?"
,angrymonkeydotnet,2007-05-04T02:24Z,The first time you run the program tell it you wish to activate later instead of manual activation. Then you will need to run the patch on the .exe. Restart Final draft and now the activation code should work for you. 
,cottar1,2007-07-09T15:03Z,does this work on mac?? thanx... 
,lathepoet,2007-07-29T02:32Z,"No, this won't work for mac.  And I'm in the same boat as everyone else.  The response code is a failure."
,lathepoet,2007-07-29T02:36Z,"When I try to run the patch, it says: ""File not exist or write protected.  Search file?""  When I press ""yes"" it repeats the message."
,gitasha11,2007-09-19T09:44Z,"I tried everything w/in the nfo file and in the order which Jannuss posted.  I got as far as it letting me know that I have 15 days to activate.  Current code won't go through.

Thanks for posting and hopefully, I can get it to work."
,gitasha11,2007-09-19T09:55Z,"After trying and trying and trying one more time what mrcrowley1999 suggested I *finally* got it to activate!!!!!!

Note: I followed ALL of the steps within the nfo file (opened in notepad)

I went back and did everything ALL over again.

Ran the patch AGAIN and then ran the Final draft.exe file.

FINALLY, the program was activated!

It seems to just take multiple tries as I did everything in the same order.

Thanks again!"
,offthejump,2007-09-20T23:39Z,"Holy shit, it works!  Thanks Dayton!!!!"
,steezy,2007-10-01T11:43Z,got it to work great torrent. i just got confused with the patch part but it was just a dumb mistake on my part.
,AlocParc,2007-10-11T06:19Z,Got it to work thanks to you guys!
,Cole Sprouse,2007-10-28T21:38Z,"Works like a charm! I had none of the problems several others have reported. Registered right on the first try.

Thanks!"
,g-nom,2007-10-31T14:28Z,"I'm probably retarded, but when it says copy the patch to your installed directory and run it from there, what does that mean?  What is the installed directory?  That's probably what I'm doing wrong.  I'm trying to run it from the original folder it came in and I keep getting the file not exist or write protected error."
,g-nom,2007-10-31T15:07Z,"Disregard my last comment, I got it to activate.  But the program seems all screwed up.  The ruler at the top only shows 1-4 instead of 1-7 or 8 like it should and the font seems huge.  It shouldn't take 2 lines to write ""INT. BOB'S OFFICE - DAY""  The screenshots in the manual look like a normal word processor type program, but mine only looks like it's the left half of the page.  I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling it but same thing.  This happen to anyone else?"
,michyme216,2007-11-23T02:45Z,"okay so i tried to do the activation but i cant get it to work an di have no idea what the ""installed directory"" is, ive asked like 10 people and they dont know either. can someone please explain to me what i have to do with the patch and what the installed directory is? thanks"
,Skala4,2007-11-27T18:06Z,"Wow, bunch of n00bs... you guys scared me i thought it would be impossible to run FGI!!!!!!  


The app works great!

Thank you!"
,Skala4,2007-11-27T19:15Z,Now if we can get someone to get us movie magic budgeting and scheduling we'll be set!!!
,michyme216,2007-11-28T03:33Z,can someone please help me?
,delia_35,2007-12-01T22:31Z,"mich, the install directory is the directory it was installed in. ^_^ As in: 
C:\Program Files\Final Draft 7\

Copy the patch into there and run it. Continue as the install.nfo file says. 

Thanks, Dayton! Works great."
,michyme216,2007-12-04T02:47Z,"wow embarassingg lol
Thank you so much!! i really appreciate it!"
,DeMontana,2007-12-17T14:47Z,"Is there any foreign language spell checkers and thesauri out there?
I would like to have these in Swedish.
Anyone?"
,us3r_unkn0wn,2008-01-01T03:44Z,I was able to get Final Draft working but Final Draft Tagger is still asking for activation. Is this normal? Are there currently any work arounds?
,kuerten23,2008-01-06T07:54Z,"Does anybody have a problem with text getting jumbled when you scroll through the file ?
It becomes normal when I save but after I type for  a while it gets jumbled again.
Please help me.It's important."
,singer928,2008-01-22T23:55Z,"OK, so I have tried to get this beggar to run. I copied the patch to the directory, I double clicked it, it says: Final Draft exe, filesize ok, crc32 check skipped, byte not found, file already patched. So then I run the program and enter # in msinfo, but it doesn't say continue, only demo is an option. I am new to all of this, but usually I can get stuff to work... help?"
,tlc024,2008-02-06T06:24Z,Works Perfectly....thanks a million guy.....now if I could just write...lol!!!
,IceHawk6,2008-02-11T03:01Z,i know it says its for windows but final draft is for mac to.. does this patch work for mac?
,number89,2008-04-20T03:12Z,this is great. the crack worked the first time i used it. thanks a bunch!
,TW0STROKE,2008-05-21T03:12Z,"It is working fine but the response code is still not working....I don't remember copying patch.exe to install directory, do I still need to? If I do, how to you copy to install directory?"
,neonjunkie,2008-06-04T17:11Z,"THANK YOU!  This is an amazing program... I feel inspired.  I got this to work after about three days.  I don't know what exactly I did differently, I was just sort of experimenting with it, and it suddenly worked.  w00t!  "
,dr_horse,2008-08-14T17:44Z,"Great ul guys. Is anyone else having trouble downloading? eset nod32 flagged the text to pdf.exe as a variant of adware.antivirus2008. I've set it to dl without that file, see how it goes..."
,TEDLAZARX58,2008-08-30T02:11Z,could somebody please help!! i have no idea how to actually copy the patch to the install directory and what is the final draft exe or what ever. i read the info file and it says run final draft7.1.1.19 and when i do it goes into an installation and tells me it fails. im lost and some real detail would help thanks guys
,filibusterer,2008-09-01T23:59Z,"Program installs fine, but in the final step I get an error message saying ""The response code you have typed in invalid."" I'm using clu072005, like it says in the .nfo - what am I doing wrong?"
,Jakk-the-Rippa,2008-09-09T17:57Z,"I seem to be having a similar problem to filibusterer except the activation code worked for me first time, however I keep getting notices that I only have the program on trial for 15 days and when I try 'activate now' with that code, it says its invalid. Anyone have a salution? I need this program pretty badly. "
,Jakk-the-Rippa,2008-09-14T13:17Z,"RESPONSE CODE NO LONGER WORKS. I cant even open final draft now due to the response code being 'invalid' every time I go to use it. It worked when I first installed final draft but after that, it kept telling me that I was in a 15 day trial and after the 15 days if i didnt provide a valid response code, the program wouldn't open, which it isnt now."
,Jakk-the-Rippa,2008-09-14T15:39Z,"Filibusterer I think i know your problem. I had the same thing with the response code but its all because of the patch. I read to copy the patch into the final draft folder, which i did, but forgot to activate it by double clicking it and running it etc. I know it sounds really obvious but it doesnt mention it in the nfo file. Should work fine with the same code if you just run the patch first."
,An4h0ny,2008-09-20T17:00Z,thx. followed the install instructions step by step and had no problem.  was up and running in about three minutes.  kudos.
,MamaPeach57,2008-09-20T21:24Z,"Hi, I'm having the same problem as singer928. For some reason, whenever I put in the registration number given, the only available option is the demo. I ran the patch correctly (or so I assume) but for some reason, it still doesn't seem to be working for me!"
,MurdocksGirl,2008-10-12T21:06Z,"I had the same problems as everyone else on the first page.
Here's how I got it to work.

1) download the torrent. 
2) install final draft BUT DO NOT RUN THE THE PROGRAM!!!
3)Open your browser and go to final draft.com and sit on their home page.
4) Copy the patch into your C:Programs/Final draft folder.
5)Run the patch.
6) NOW OPEN FINAL DRAFT
follow the rest of the instructions per the NFO file (which, if you are running with vista will need to opened with notepad).

The codes will work if you do it in this order above.

Can anyone make a torrent of EP Budget and Scheduling? IF you do, you will be forever my favorite person for the rest of my life."
,panuru,2008-10-22T02:35Z,Worked absolutely fine for me simply by following the instructions file included in the torrent.
,lwpjb,2008-10-24T08:45Z,"Someone must have corrupted this torrent. There are no opening instructions and no serial included in the bundle I downloaded. :(
"
,Meko_,2008-10-25T17:02Z,I just downloaded it and it all looks like it's there. I will try to install and let you know what happens. Check your firewall...!!!
,Meko_,2008-10-25T17:17Z,"This works GREAT!!!

All i did was follow these instructions posted from Jannuss at 2007-09-07 16:53 CET:


Run Final Final Draft v7.1.1.19.EXE and follow instructions.

Copy Patch.EXE to your installed directory and run it from there.

Follow these steps to register/activate.

Enter this Customer Number: 7FD-246-594-826-987

When asked to Activate go to Activate Now -> Manual Activation.

Enter this Response Code: clu072005

When asked if you would like to register, click Register Later. "
,Maleshevich,2008-11-07T18:31Z,"watching all these ""i-can't-do-a-thing"" comments made me wonder should i download it at all.

Fortunately, i did. AND IT WORKS!!!!!
i had no web connection, and no web site in the browser or anything. JUST FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!!!!
period"
,jpspencer79,2008-11-20T23:30Z,"Followed the directions in the comments, runs like a charm.  I'll seed for about 10 days."
,bobblehat86,2008-12-09T16:31Z,"Worked perfectly Thanks! make sure you follow the instructions to the letter and remember not to open Final draft before you run the patch.

Ps. is it possible to upgrade it with the demo? or will that invalidate it?"
,thesmilingbandit,2008-12-30T14:05Z,Thank you very much for Sharing!
,ldo,2009-01-02T00:08Z,Works like a charm.
,Allan Ong,2009-01-09T00:50Z,becareful to immediately burn your downloads to a disk as my antivirus detected the patch as a trojan backdoor and deleted it. it may be the reason why some of you cannot make your final draft work
,thevaultkeeper,2009-01-19T14:53Z,"Top job Dayton, installed, patched, activated, denied registration and all went flawlessly. Can't see where others are having problems !?!

,safsurferbay,2009-03-12T16:29Z,worked like a charm. follow .nfo instructions and will work fine. using on vista ultimate 64bit quad processor. I do have question...is it ok to do the 'program updates' from the help pulldown menu to get v7.1.3???
,charvin,2009-03-17T04:13Z,"EVERYONE. I'm using vista, and followed the instructions, but when I got to the register page and put in the code, it didn't work. BUT, i found if you erase the last digit, and then write it in again, it'll recognize it (the copy/paste didn't work completely right.)  From there click register later, then follow the rest of instructions. "

,blindedraven,2009-04-20T06:17Z,Works perfectly! Thanks!
,Gonga8,2009-12-26T07:44Z,MurdocksGirl at 2008-10-12 left the clear explanation of how to make it work. Thanks for this its realy great!
