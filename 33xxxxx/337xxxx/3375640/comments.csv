,gmenright,2008-05-17T05:14Z,"haven't finished the DL yet, but I'd bet A LOT that the 'blood rave' track is the music from the rave scene at the beginning of the film 'Blade'.

FYI everyone, that song was made by New Order like 5 years before the film. It's called ""Confusion - Pump Panel Mix""."

Btw, some of the files in the mixed folder are not labeled properly thought I?d help future downloaders out.
Blast - The Crystal Method from Hardhop + Trypno album
(Can't You) Trip Like I Do - The Crystal Method feat. Filter from Spawn OST
Blood Rave is actually Confusion by New Order
Caterpillar ? KĂŤoki (dunno what version of the song, I don?t think it?s the crystal remix
I Think I?m Crystalized ? Garbage (It?s the Crystal Method remix of I Think I?m Paranoid)
Magic Carpet Ride is actually a remix of the Steppenwolf song by Fatboy Slim, not Crystal Method.
Nitrous Oxide 7 is actually called Busy Child (Ă&#x153;berzone Mix)
Nitrous Oxide 8 is Now Is The Time (Industrial Cloud Mix)
Smartbomb is actually by BT, not the Crystal Method
Dunno about Sidewinder, More, or Caterpillar
I uploaded The Crystal Method: London OST: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5334832 for all you hardcore fans."
