Series 2(?) of Absolute Power as broadcast by the BBC on Thursday evenings.  DVB dumps, no re-encoding or re-compression.  Comedy starring Stephen Fry and John Bird.
I wouldn't really bother putting these large format videos online, but I have been practising making menus.
Also look out for Extras DVD
See you all later for Dr Who :-)
