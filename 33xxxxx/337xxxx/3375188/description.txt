Here are the first four seasons of the Bravo TV show, Celebrity Poker Showdown.  For those of you not familiar with the format, it works like this: each "season"/tournament is 6 games long (5 qualifying games, 1 championship).  Each of the 5 qualifying games is between 5 celebrities, with the winner moving on to the championship.

The show is hosted by Kevin Pollack & Phil Gordon to start, and Dave Foley & Phil Gordon in later seasons.  All of the celebrities are playing for charity, with the prize pool donated by whoever happens to be sponsoring the season.

This show airs regularly on Bravo in the US (season 6 should be coming up soon).  This is a complete collection of the first four seasons.  I only have one or two episodes available from season 5, so if anyone has those, please let me know and/or torrent them.

For those of you that may have a favourite celebrity you want to see, a complete list of all the players follows below (note that I havn't listed who plays in the championships, so as not to ruin any surprises).
