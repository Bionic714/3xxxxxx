After an accident in space, a team of scientists find that their DNA has been forever altered. The result? Superpowers, of course. Lead geek Reed Richards (Gruffudd) transforms into Mr. Fantastic, a man who can stretch his body. Susan Storm (Alba) becomes the Invisible Woman, while her brother, Johnny Storm (Evans), finds that as the Human Torch, he can set himself ablaze. Finally, Ben Grimm (Chiklis) turns into the Thing, a creature made of rocks. Together, dubbed the Fantastic Four, they take on the evil Dr. Doom.
