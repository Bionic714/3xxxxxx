,spankbot,2007-04-05T08:45Z,"For those stuck at 99.9%.  You are probably experiencing a client error.  Try restarting your client software.  Consider using a good client like Azureus - I've never had this problem and I use Azureus on Mac, Linux, and even sometimes Windows when I feel like hurting myself."

,LmEnt,2010-01-01T00:48Z,"Well, After 15days, it finally finished.. Now It Has 93 RAR files and when extracted, most of them are corrupt. Then to top it off, it is in .img format. Which means that you have to search for a converter and waste 8 hrs and all processors on a quad core machine..... Then when it is burnt the audio is 2.5 out of 10..... THe best way to watch it is to burn with DvDFab 6 and turn the volume up all the way......

I just wish people that take the taime to share their stuff (THANKS TO ALL) would tag the info properly, that way newbies can do it too... 

All in all no worth the download/Band width... I will NOT SEED SHIT TORRENTS...EVER.."
