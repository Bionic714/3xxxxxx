This is a video of when B&S took their popular live TV Show "Unplanned" to London's West End over 54 individual shows; and the video gives us the highlights over 1 weekend at the height of its run. I have followed Baddiel and Skinner from the Fantasy Football shows and the banter between the two is still alive and well. In fact, it's better. I watched this and could not stop laughing out loud as it's packed full of rude, clever and down right silly jokes and comments. I would be so surprised if someone managed to sit all the way through it without laughing! Just hope the TV series comes back on soon.
