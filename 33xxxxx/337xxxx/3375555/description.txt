Fireman is a single intelligent game. The player should rescue the person and animals stranded upstairs because of fire. The method is dotting the building under their feet with the same color and a story will disappear (there need to be two pieces with the same colors at least). The stranded people and animals also have their own fleeing abilities for their lives, and they can self-flee differently on the 5-1 story. The player should manage to let the people who have the least fleeing ability flee first, so that, when you rescue all of the people, you also need to clear up the left buildings with the same color until there are no combining same color buildings. If there are no combing same color buildings and there are still someone who is not rescued, then it is announced that GAME OVER. It is noticed that the elders need to be treated first, because they can't insist too much time in fire.
