Earth 2150: Lost Souls

The last of the Earth 2150 chapters, has all the units upgrades, etc. from teh original and the Moon Project, but only has the Lost Souls campaing(s) (for the other campaings you need to find the others).

I personally like this game very much, tho it may be very, very confusing at first, but you'll get used to it.

For more info read the info in the package. ;)



PS. I will be seeding for a while (at least 'til few others get it), but it won't be pretty, cause of my small 50Kb up.
