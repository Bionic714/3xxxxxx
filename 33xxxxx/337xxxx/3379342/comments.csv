,Apolloncho,2006-04-25T09:46Z,"First, sorry for the off-topic, but I'm desperate. 

Does someone of you know when Desperados 2: Cooper's Revenge will be on the net, since different sources provide different information, and I don't know what to expect?"
,firefox009,2006-04-26T01:59Z,"@ Apolloncho:
Desperados 2 is not really out in most countries. Its out in australia or something I think. You're gonna have to wait at least a week before you would even be able to buy it."
,Apolloncho,2006-04-28T14:11Z,"@firefox009

On the contrary, it is already out in my country. I am still waiting for someone to crack it, though. That's why I wanted to see if any of you knew something about the cracking part. Anyway, I'll probably have to buy it."
,Apolloncho,2006-05-05T14:57Z,"Yes, the demo is pretty good. But the whole game is still nowhere to be found for download."
,SnippeX,2006-05-29T00:54Z,"When i open the read me file, my IE starts, but no text or information are posted, can someone who see this part post it? "
,SnippeX,2006-05-29T22:34Z,"Nothing works for me! When i tried to unpack the winrar archive, an error message told me that the archive is corupt or damage, I have tried to repair it, but with no sucess. Is it just me?"
