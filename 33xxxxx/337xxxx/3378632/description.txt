  In 1994 West Chester, PA, friends Deron Miller and Jess     
  Margera formed a band under the name Foreign Objects.  In   
  1995 they released a 5-track EP on Distant Recordings called
  The Undiscovered Numbers & Colors, which was described by   
  some as "Earth Crisis meets Rush."                          
  In 1996, they decided to start another band called Oil.     
  After some confusion with a New York band also named Oil,   
  Deron changed the name to Camp Kill Yourself. In 1998,      
  Jess's brother Bam, a pro skateboarder, was featured on Toy 
  Machine's video "Jump Off A Building," so during "Bam's Park
  Footy," they played the band's song "Genesis 12a."  In the  
  credits there was contact info on how to get more CKY       
  recordings. Bam's antics in "Jump Off A Building" were loved
  by viewers, so he released a full-length video of them      
  through Landspeed Wheels called "Landspeed: cKy" in March   
  1999. He needed a soundtrack, so he gathered up all the     
  songs CKY had and used them in the video, and they recorded 
  a few extra songs just for the video.  Deron and Jess added 
  Ryan Bruni to the band on bass because Deron worked with him
  at UPS.  When they went to Groundhog studios to record the  
  album, they recruited Chad Ginsburg from the band Rudy &    
  Blitz on guitars.  Chad was producing the album and joined  
  the band at their request.  They released "Camp Kill        
  Yourself: Volume 1" on Teil Martin International, and "Camp 
  Kill Yourself: Volume 2," which was prank calls and songs   
  that were on the video but didn't make it onto Volume 1,    
  plus some extras. They both sold out quickly. The band went 
  on the 1999 Warped Tour and played for Volcom, but were     
  kicked off after a protest in St. Louis over the prices the 
  tour's vendors were charging. By this time, they had become 
  superstars in the skateboarding world. In late summer, they 
  were signed to the Volcom Entertainment record label, and   
  released a re-mastered Volume 1 in December.                
  In February 2000, Ryan Bruni was out of the band. According 
  to some, he left because he didn't get along with Jess, and 
  others say he was kicked out because he didn't really       
  contribute to the band (Deron played most of the bass on    
  Volume 1). Then Volcom's lawyers were afraid of some people 
  being offended by the band's name, as well as the album     
  cover (a drawing of Bud Dywer, a politician who killed      
  himself on live TV in the 1980s).  So Volcom changed the    
  band's name to Camp and changed the album's artwork and on  
  04.01.00 released "CAMP: cKy" but no one liked the new name.
  So after some pushing, the band was able to get its name    
  changed to simply CKY. In May, Volcom rereleased the album  
  AGAIN with the same art as CAMP: cKy, but on the tray they  
  changed it to say cKy: CAMP. After the video CKY2K had come 
  out, CKY had been exposed to people across the world. Even  
  Limp Bizkit, Green Day, and Blink-182 became fans. CKY      
  played the Warped Tour again that summer, but didn't get to 
  play the West Coast. They released a limited edition EP,    
  "Disengage The Simulator," for the Warped Tour. It sold out 
  after 2 months. Without a bassist, Chad had been forced to  
  play bass all through the Warped Tour until July, when they 
  found bass player Vern Zaborowski and recruited him into the
  band. In October 2000, Bam became part of the hit MTV show  
  "Jackass," and some of the band's music was played, such as 
  "96 Quite Bitter Beings," "Genesis 12a," and "Shippensburg."
  CKY was reaching out to even more people, and so Volcom     
  released what would be the FINAL incarnation of the album:  
  "cKy: Camp Volume 1." With CKY's music taking over MTV on   
  "Jackass," it was time for them to hit the big time: to hit 
  TRL. Many people were saying it would be a bad thing and    
  that MTV sucks, but it was decided that the reason the fans 
  don't like MTV is because MTV doesn't play the kind of music
  they like, and if CKY started putting their videos on MTV,  
  it would make it better. On December, MTV played the "96    
  Quite Bitter Beings" video on a show called "HotZone," and  
  it was filled with footage from "Jackass."  Fans were       
  disappointed, but the band told them that the video didn't  
  matter, the important thing was the music.

  In 1994 West Chester, PA, friends Deron Miller and Jess     
  Margera formed a band under the name Foreign Objects.  In   
  1995 they released a 5-track EP on Distant Recordings called
  The Undiscovered Numbers & Colors, which was described by   
  some as "Earth Crisis meets Rush."                          
  In 1996, they decided to start another band called Oil.     
  After some confusion with a New York band also named Oil,   
  Deron changed the name to Camp Kill Yourself. In 1998,      
  Jess's brother Bam, a pro skateboarder, was featured on Toy 
  Machine's video "Jump Off A Building," so during "Bam's Park
  Footy," they played the band's song "Genesis 12a."  In the  
  credits there was contact info on how to get more CKY       
  recordings. Bam's antics in "Jump Off A Building" were loved
  by viewers, so he released a full-length video of them      
  through Landspeed Wheels called "Landspeed: cKy" in March   
  1999. He needed a soundtrack, so he gathered up all the     
  songs CKY had and used them in the video, and they recorded 
  a few extra songs just for the video.  Deron and Jess added 
  Ryan Bruni to the band on bass because Deron worked with him
  at UPS.  When they went to Groundhog studios to record the  
  album, they recruited Chad Ginsburg from the band Rudy &    
  Blitz on guitars.  Chad was producing the album and joined

  Yourself: Volume 1" on Teil Martin International, and "Camp 
  Kill Yourself: Volume 2," which was prank calls and songs   
  that were on the video but didn't make it onto Volume 1,    
  plus some extras. They both sold out quickly. The band went 
  on the 1999 Warped Tour and played for Volcom, but were     
  kicked off after a protest in St. Louis over the prices the 
  tour's vendors were charging. By this time, they had become 
  superstars in the skateboarding world. In late summer, they 
  were signed to the Volcom Entertainment record label, and   
  released a re-mastered Volume 1 in December.                
  In February 2000, Ryan Bruni was out of the band. According 
  to some, he left because he didn't get along with Jess, and 
  others say he was kicked out because he didn't really       
  contribute to the band (Deron played most of the bass on    
  Volume 1). Then Volcom's lawyers were afraid of some people 
  being offended by the band's name, as well as the album     
  cover (a drawing of Bud Dywer, a politician who killed      
  himself on live TV in the 1980s).  So Volcom changed the    
  band's name to Camp and changed the album's artwork and on  
  04.01.00 released "CAMP: cKy" but no one liked the new name.
  So after some pushing, the band was able to get its name    
  changed to simply CKY. In May, Volcom rereleased the album  
  AGAIN with the same art as CAMP: cKy, but on the tray they  
  changed it to say cKy: CAMP. After the video CKY2K had come 
  out, CKY had been exposed to people across the world. Even  
  Limp Bizkit, Green Day, and Blink-182 became fans. CKY      
  played the Warped Tour again that summer, but didn't get to 
  play the West Coast. They released a limited edition EP,    
  "Disengage The Simulator," for the Warped Tour. It sold out 
  after 2 months. Without a bassist, Chad had been forced to  
  play bass all through the Warped Tour until July, when they 
  found bass player Vern Zaborowski and recruited him into the
  band. In October 2000, Bam became part of the hit MTV show  
  "Jackass," and some of the band's music was played, such as 
  "96 Quite Bitter Beings," "Genesis 12a," and "Shippensburg."
  CKY was reaching out to even more people, and so Volcom     
  released what would be the FINAL incarnation of the album:  
  "cKy: Camp Volume 1." With CKY's music taking over MTV on   
  "Jackass," it was time for them to hit the big time: to hit 
  TRL. Many people were saying it would be a bad thing and    
  that MTV sucks, but it was decided that the reason the fans 
  don't like MTV is because MTV doesn't play the kind of music
  they like, and if CKY started putting their videos on MTV,  
  it would make it better. On December, MTV played the "96    
  Quite Bitter Beings" video on a show called "HotZone," and  
  it was filled with footage from "Jackass."  Fans were       
  disappointed, but the band told the
