:: NOTES :: 

Back in 2002 during the North American Fragility 2.0 tour, NIN
recorded seven tracks at the Chicago Recording Company. 
Seated in front of a handful of lucky fans, they performed an 
unplugged acoustic set, with Reznor showing the true beauty 
of his work.  

For unknown reasons, these tracks were never officially released 
but eventually sifted onto the Internet to the joy of many fans.
Sadly, some greedy individuals have been selling copies of the 
performance on eBay. However, if you look hard enough you can 
find them floating around on the Internet ;)

The quality of the CRC recording is flawless, leaving one with the only 
assumption that it is straight off the soundboard, and is debatably better 
than And All That Could Have Been (2002). Some tracks are very similar 
to Still (2002), yet they have more soul behind them, most likely due to 
the audience's presence. Each and every track is a polished piece of work 
that if they were to have replaced the original album versions no one 
would have know. The CRC Sessions is a unique live recording that until 
And All That Could Have Been (2002) was released was by far the highest 
quality recording of live Nine Inch Nails, and still could be, you decide.
