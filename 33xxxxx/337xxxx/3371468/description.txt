DJ Shadow, cutting things up in front of his amazing visuals.

The visuals were amazing - the opening zooming shot from outer space down, down, down until you're in the grooves of a 12", and the concise history of Nottingham.

What you might not hear on air was the man playing the visuals himself - "Taking it to the next level" as he said himself. Playing what was like a drum pad he beat out video samples from cheesy American 'Teach yourself to play the drums' videos. Though rough round the edges during it's debut performance, it had everyone captivated - even the security guards at the front of the stage turned round and were nodding heads, joining the huge cheers from the crowd at the end!

Being allowed an encore of 15 minutes (but actually taking 25), we got some "greatest hits" which brought the crowd that had started to filter off home back to dancefloor to the sound of "You Can't Go Home Again".

Mind blowing.
