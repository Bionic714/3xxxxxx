,deaddeaddead,2005-08-17T14:10Z,"missing some pages, at least in issue 9, and one of the covers.. recoverable or we need to try and find them from another source?"
,bopgun23,2005-08-18T03:16Z,issue 9 is fine from my end. it must've gone back somewhere along the way. send a message to bopgun23@gmail.com and i'll send whoever any corrupted issues via email.
,Thom-Thom,2010-08-24T12:53Z,Issue #29 doesn't load. Issue #32 (LAST issue) is missing. Some minor errors - otherwise a brilliant comic - thanks bopgun.
