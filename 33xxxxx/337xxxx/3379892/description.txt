The default security settings in Internet Explorer are more
restrictive in the Windows Server 2003 family than in earlier versions
of Windows. When you upgrade, any settings that do not match the new
default settings are overwritten. These changes decrease the exposure
of your servers to attacks that are launched through Web content.
However, users will not be able to view many Web pages correctly when
using the default security settings. To allow users to see these Web
pages correctly, you must explicitly grant access. In addition, users
will not be able to run executable files from Universal Naming
Convention (UNC) shared folders until you or the users have added the
shared computer to the Local intranet security zone in Internet
Explorer. 

For more information about security settings and how to change them,
see relnotes.htm in the Docs folder on the operating system disc.
