About 20 years old, Elina is a brave and intelligent young activist studying history and political science at the university. Elina and Tuomas have had a happy relationship for over a year and are planning to get married.

A chain reaction of events starts after Niko forges a 500 euro note. In the film´s other plot, the attack planned by Tuomas and Elina on an information network has grave consequences.
