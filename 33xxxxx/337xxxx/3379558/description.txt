Game story:

Based on the plot of the action film Tom Yum Goong, this 3-dimensional videogame will 
allow players to assume the protagonist role and use Muay Thai skills to defeat members 
of an international mafia gang and rescue the prized elephant. 

The game was modeled after the film's main star, Panom Yeerum (Tony Jaa). Programmers 
captured Jaa's movements by recording his real actions in video format before meticulously
created realistic 3-dimensional animations for the game's characters. 
The videogame will allow players to execute 30 different Muay Thai movements.


Note: Tom Yum Goong
