,ibjorn,2006-01-09T22:17Z,"In OS X you can just rename the .mdf file as .iso. Then, either mount it or burn with disc utility as normally. "
[V],holyfc,2006-01-16T00:33Z,"Now, I am a PC man myself. I just decided to upgrade my iMac for the fun of it. The following helped me with regards to making the CD1 bootable. I just burnt the image after converting to ISO using MagicISO/UltraISO. Then after putting the CD in my Mac, I went to the controlpanel - chose ""Startupdisk"", chose the CD - and restarted. It worked great!"
,dancingelmo,2006-01-18T21:18Z,"Hmmm...I can burn discs 2-4 using Disk Utility in Panther.  However, when attempting to burn disk 1, it tells me that there's not enough room on the CD.  The image size for disc one as an ISO is 737.1MB.  The image also will not mount within Panther, saying an HFS filesystem cannot be found in the image.  I followed ibjorn's advice in changing the file extension from MDF to ISO and then attempting to burn.  Any advice?"
,dancingelmo,2006-01-20T23:49Z,"Went ahead and just downloaded disc 1 from another source.  Now is it okay to do a Software Update, or will the FBI come storming down my door?"
,samhain959,2006-01-24T05:11Z,yeah I'd like to know that too.  Can we use Software Update once we've installed?
,junkyboy,2006-01-29T12:07Z,"This worked like a charm.

with disc 2, 3 and 4, I opened the ISO file in UltraISO then hit File/Properties and changed the CD file system to HFS+ then burnt the disc from there... works a treat

I didn't try the Nero way, but this way definitely works.

,JasonJ05,2007-01-31T23:32Z,"Hello everyone,

Important information:

I'm like a lot of you. I am using a WINDOWS computer to burn programs for my MAC.

CD1 was easy to burn onto a CD. Use Alcohol 120%.

However, CD2, CD3, CD4 gave me a heart attack. Nero, UltraISO or Alcohol 120% will not burn CD2, CD3 and CD4 properly. I wasted 10 discs on those 3 files. Burning the three ISO's with a WINDOWS computer is difficult. 

Anyways,

If you want to burn CD2, CD3 and CD4, you must use a MAC computer. That's right. 

Now if you already installed CD1 to your MAC. You're pretty much stuck to asking a friend if you could use his/her MAC to properly burn CD 2-CD 4 because you can't cancel the installation process after CD1 is installled. 

Basically my instructions are

-burn the ISOs (on your WINDOWS computer) to a DVD.
-find a mac
-insert the DVD into the mac
-drag the ISO's out of the CD and into the DESKTOP or whatever (a folder...doesn't matter)
-go to the MAC HD
-applications, disk utilities
-drag CD2 iso to the disc utilities menu
-insert CD-R
-Burn
-repeat steps for CD3, and CD4.

-Insert the newly burnt CDs into YOUR mac.

Congratulations! Your MAC is no longer brick'd.



Your friend,
JasonJ05 from Vancouver Canada"
,JasonJ05,2007-01-31T23:50Z,"BlueDingo asked, ""how do i make a iso out of the many rar files?""

Download winrar
Double click on one of the winrar folders.
Drag the iso to your desktop
Then read the post above and follow the steps

Sincerly,

,Dust_X,2007-02-26T15:08Z,Is it okay to burn the images to DVDs???
,Philosogogue,2007-04-21T02:25Z,"Anything that you might want changed into (or from) a DMG or BIN can be changed into an ISO and Burned through the Disk Utility.  Yes, it is already in your Mac.

	1.	Insert blank disc.
	2.	Open Disk Utility.
	3.	From File menu, choose Open Disk Image, selecting the ISO to burn.
	4.	From the list of volumes click the ISO file image.
	5.	Click ""Burn"" then follow the instructions.

Instead of burn click ?Append? and you can add in multiple session or rewrite the disk.  Only The ""Burn"" makes it permanent.

,Hobbs3000,2008-06-22T02:50Z,"
Ok people who are using windows to get this to work. Here's how I've just managed to 

get it to work. Apparently if you're working with a Mac of some description, then 

it's slightly different method used (I'm using Xp home). I tried following Kustavs 

comment, but using windows to make isos via windows programs didn't work for me 

(plus a lot of google research). And also 2 different tiger cd torrent downloads, 

lots of down time and about a dozen cd-r's later, I've sussed it. 
I've just put it on a G3 imac, and it's working.

No booting from an ipod, or external hard drive needed.

The torrent does work (with some implementation)

First download torrent, and scroll/read Kustavs comment.
2. Click the link there for the 1st tiger cd and download that. It's already been 

iso'd, so just needs to be burned to cd. This can be burned via a windows program 

though. I used Active Iso Burner. And it's free. Read the install there and it says 

that while it works (the first cd), it fails the disc check at the end of 

installation. That's fine, but i'll get to that in a bit.

3. Ok with the 1st cd burnded from Kustavs link, you're ready for the next stage. 

Which is burning the other 3 cds to disc. You can't use a normal windows iso burner 

to do this. This is because the files are mac files ending in .dmg. And a normal 

windows iso burner does not do the job here. (trust me, cost me about 8 cds of 

trying different strokes). So after a lot of research, what you need is TRANSMAC. 

This is not free, but it's here on this site, with nessary bonuses (which works). 

Here below is the url for you to take a look and make your own mind up.

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4217944/Acute.Systems.TransMac.8.1.Cracked-RAZUM.7z

So download this, read it (a bit confusing). Once Transmac is working, basically 

click on tools tab and choose burn cd. Locate the 2nd tiger mac file ending .dmg and 

just click to burn. It doesn't need to be burned at all into an Iso. Your mac 

computer should automatically just read the cd when placed (researched it on net).
Repeat these steps for .dmg file 3 and 4.

Make sure you burn with low speed. (don't take much longer)

4. Once you have all 4 cds, you're ready. So power the mac up, get the first disc 

and restart. Pressing key C for me to boot the cd. Like Kustav link states ""the disc 

fails the disc check at the end"". Don' t panic, just click Ignor/carry on, or 

whatever the tab states. And when prompted, insert disc 2/3/and 4.

And that's it people. I've bothered to add this comment as there's too many 

conflicting advise and bad torrents. I'm no expert here, so if it doesn't work for 

you, it's not my fault. But what i've listed has just worked on an old iMac G3. And 

as the torrent lists that it's the retail version (and not specifically for a 

macbook or power mac or whatever) then you should be in luck.

Thanks to all those who provide great torrents (and there bonuses), and remember 

people KEEP SEEDING.

Seed this torrent as there's not many of these Tiger mothers about anymore.

Good luck

Hobbs"
,Hobbs3000,2008-06-22T02:57Z,"Ok people. After all that typing, i've posted my previous comment on the wrong torrent. So the torrent I'm refering to is below. Link should take you there.

,cactusleaf,2008-09-18T03:19Z,"CodeFuture, man, thank you for this wonderful torrent. i just finished a successful install and it went off without a hitch. all i did was this: 

a. followed your instructions exactly on my PC, using Alcohol 120% and Nero

b. booted my mac mini from CD1 by pressing ""option"" during startup to select the disk

c. followed the prompts on the installer.. fed it disk 2, 3, and 4 with no issues and it finished strong

that's it. easy as pie. now i'm running OS X 10.4 according to my machine.. for free! i'll be seeding. thanks again."
,blakeyo23,2009-01-10T14:49Z,"Hey there!! Ive been having problems too, like most on this torrent. The trick is, the first CD, which ive been having trouble making bootable, once you unpack all the files in the CD1 folder, you need both the files you extracted. 

i thought because it was a tiny 10kb or less file, it wasn't needed. Boy was i wrong!! everytime i tried to load it into Alcohol 120% without the small file, it said it wasnt a valid image file.

with that tiny file it worked perfectly!! the rest of the discs i burned on my mac as they can only be burned on a pc with a special program. i hope my limited knowledge helps.

The real heroes of this torrent are of course CodeFuture, Jason J05, and Kustav. your tips have been invaluable to me. This torrent is the best and it installs great on my iMac G3 400MHz!! 

Thanks guys!!:)"
