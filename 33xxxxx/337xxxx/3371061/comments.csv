,DonYugo,2007-07-10T18:56Z,"@chrdak 
well it depends where you live, if you live in North-America, South-America or Japan you will need NTSC, if you live in Europe, Australia or New Zealand, you will need PAL. But the real difference isn't that easy to explain and also not very necessary.
And it also depends if you use dvd-r or +r, I use dvd-r  and live in Europe, don't know if it's of any importance but it might be."
