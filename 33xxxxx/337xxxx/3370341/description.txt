Plot: 
Stewie, the maniacal baby genius, is distracted from 
his plans for world domination when he sees a man 
who looks just like him on television. Convinced that 
this man must be his real father (after all, how could 
he possibly share genetic material with the dimwitted Peter?), 
Stewie sets off on a cross-country road trip to find him. 
But his incredible journey leads him to discoveries far 
more vile and shocking than anything found in his diaper.
