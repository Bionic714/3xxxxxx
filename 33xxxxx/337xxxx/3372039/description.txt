Another album from the best unknown band ever around. 
Del Amitri ? Some Other Suckers Parade. Their best album if you ask me.
It came out in 1997 and contains the following songs.

1   Not Where It`s At
2   Some Other Sucker`s Parade
3   Won`t Make It Better
4   What I Think She Sees
5   Medecine
6   High Times
7   Mother Nature`s Writing
8   No Family Man
9   Cruel Light Of Day
10  Funny Way To Win
11  Through All That Nothing
12  Life Is Full
13  Lucky Guy
14  Make It Always Be Too Late

As always, buy the record if you like it. Justin Currie is well worth supporting.
