Release Notes:

Iron Maiden have confirmed they are to release a Double DVD and Live 
Album titled ?DEATH ON THE ROAD? through EMI Records on August 29th 
2005. 

The show was filmed at the Westfalenhalle Arena, Dortmund, Germany 
during the Dance of Death European Tour in December 2003 and fully 
captures the magnificent stage production and electricity of the band?s 
performance. Steve Harris once again took weeks personally editing the 
footage and like Rock in Rio this means thousands of cuts right into the 
heart of the action.
