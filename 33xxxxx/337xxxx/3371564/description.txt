Published by Regnery Publishing, 2005. 
Scanned to PDF and distributed as Torrent on 18th of August 2005. 

Originally 270 pages, this PDF is only 231 pages - Notes and appendix are not included.

The Author is the main drive behind www.jihadwatch.org and has written numerous books on the dangers of Islam. 

I ripped this book because it's important that the dangers of Islam is revealed to the world - and i apologize to the Author for stealing his intellectual property and the proceedings thereof.
