Whenever I see All Over Me I feel like picking up my Daisy Rock (I'm not just the classical buff!) so why don't you also rock a bit with the Sichel sisters who made this film.

Described on the cover as sweet lesbo drama, I guess it is but it's more than that. I find it really scary; a violent New York is portrayed, with drugs, murders, and, apart from a few nice guys, dangerous boys (no, dangerous guys are not sexy at all), and old men taking any chance hitting on you whether you're 15 or 50, etc. Take care, girls!
