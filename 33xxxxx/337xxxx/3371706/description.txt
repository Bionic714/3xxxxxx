This is the original SSE3 capable CoreGraphics file.

It needs to go in:

/System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/CoreGraphics.framework/Versions/A

Although thats just a Symlink. You can find out whre that points to using the os.

Make sure you note the original owner and access rights for the file (Do this by typing ls -l at the command prompt).

I did this using single user mode (boot using the -s action).
