A long time ago, in the beginning of 2000 Linus Lindh (Machinegun Gooch) and Linus Boman (Maniac Bo) met in the alley och Campino. Machinegun Gooch and Maniac Bo didn´t know that they were about to change rockhistory forever and ever. They started the best of all the tributebands in the whole wide world.

Centuries later they are considered to be THE hardest rocking, best looking, mother f***ers in the univers. And the name you ask? take a good guess asshole. The name of the best rockband ever is....
TENACIOUS B.

If you´ve seen your mom with a goldenrabbit in her bronzecave you know what the hell we´re made of. So if you got the power, oh yes the power to move, put your fucking hands together and sing along with the best of the best (no, not the marines of the US). THe BIG BO´s.
