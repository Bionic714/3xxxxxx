,drdos,2007-02-18T18:25Z,anyone know where i might get my hands on an keyfile?!
,bnjiman,2007-02-23T03:56Z,"yes, the installer creates a file Tracktion.Key in your c:\program files\Tracktion2 directory (or wherever you install it). Go unlock with keyfile from within Tracktion. Also check the PDF reference guide. It's a point-and-click through system so you won't see lists of commands from the top level (e.g. File, Edit, View). Great program once you've figured it though."
