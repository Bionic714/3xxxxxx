Not really an e-book, per se... A 1280x960 picture was taken of each double page. It is thus readable on the computer, but it's not easily printable.

Now, if you're wondering what the hell it is, you probably do not need to download it. (Because if you were a regular book reader of any repute, you should know about it already, seeing as it was received with great critical acclaim a few years ago.) Anyway, it is a novel, a story told from the POV by a 15yo kid with Asperger's who likes dogs and beats me at Minesweeper. Sounds fun, right? Right! I took the pictures for an internet friend who just would not fork the cash to buy a copy.

It's a good book, I promise.

Here it is on Amazon: (a different edition)
