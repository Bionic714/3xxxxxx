The so-called "Powers that Be" have quite often maintained a stranglehold on information which they do not believe should be available to the general public. These corporate, religious, or governmental organizations have their own best interests in mind, and use their considerable power to maintain the status quo. This series of investigations reveals some of the hidden secrets. "Monopoly Men" - The Federal Reserve, or the Fed as it is lovingly called, may be one of the most mysterious entities in modern American government.

Who keeps the interest? Good question. Find out as the connective tissue between this and other top-secret international organizations is explored and exposed. Hosted by Dean Stockwell.
