This is a collection of 31 old Infocom-games, ie. text-adventures. That's almost ALL of them, it's only missing four games, (Arthur, A Mind Forever Voyaging, James Clavell's Shogun and Journey, please feel free to complete the collection!)
Included are also manuals, maps and hints. But no interpreter. To play these games you need to download WinFrotz or equivalent program.

These games are eternal classics, giving you incredible experiences you can only dream of playing those modern FPS-games...
