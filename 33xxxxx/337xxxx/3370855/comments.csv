,Deftone30,2006-04-16T21:37Z,O.k. I have found that this program does not support Xvid movies. Which really blows considering 90% of the movies found here are encoded in Xvid!! If anyone has found a fix for this or a codec that resolves this problem please let me know! I haven't been able to find one as of yet. Thanks!

,jediknight36,2009-03-19T22:24Z,"When I try to install, it says I am missing the DVDit.msi files. The only thing it installs is the labeler. "
,drcheney,2009-05-11T07:29Z,"I extracted this file and my Norton Antivirus said I had a ""backdoor.graywale"" threat to my computer, but nothing happened.  Looking at these other comments, I'm sure that this is a problem that only I have had.  But hey, I never have problems like this, so I would think that there is at least a chance that this program either:

1) contains a virus
2) contains something that Norton Antivirus thinks is a virus
3) is nothing, and it's just my computer, although this is a brand new computer so I doubt it"
