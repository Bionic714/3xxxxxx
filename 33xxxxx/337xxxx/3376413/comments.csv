,ChobThomas,2008-03-06T18:05Z,"What gives? The ONE song I wanted, the one I specifically had in mind when I searched for this torrent, is the ONE song that isn't here! Song #10 - Dangerous on C'est Cheese."
,chemicallunacy,2009-01-27T19:52Z,"If you can find their live, Semi-Conducted, album there's a live version of Dangerous on it.

I'm glad that I found this.. I've been to many of their concerts and have bought every one of their cds (and their dvd), however I lost them all when I moved. Thanks for this :)"
