At the present time the PSP scene is growing stronger
and stronger everyday although, until the xecuter 
memory board mod is released, there is still the pressing
issue of storage for games etc.

I've found that the best way to overcome this is to create
a DVD to carry around with your PSP, this might sound lame
but because of the PSPs true plug and play USB interface 
its quick and easy to swap games aslong as you can access 
a PC with a DVD drive and a spare USB point.

I have created this DVD image because i thought it would be 
useful for others.

I apoligise to the respective 'owners' of these releases as
i am, in a way, re-releasing your work but ive found this 
quite useful and i thought i'd release the image i use for 
other PSP owners.

This is disk v0.7 because there is more on the way and 
ill update the disk when newer software versions etc are 
released.
