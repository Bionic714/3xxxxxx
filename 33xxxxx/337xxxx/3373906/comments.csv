I have ben wanting a snes emulator and a bunch of games for a while....This just made it easy..  Thank you again.. however the file in here named sex pics{witch has absolutely nothing to do with nes roms} inside the folder with all the snes roms contains a trojan.   There is one in this file and one in a game that starts with a A.  It was a football game.. However i forgot the name..   People look at the file types before opening them...  Scan everything... Other then that  it works great... Just like you said ...Working emulator and games all in one folder.. and grat choice  of games as well...Lacks a lil bit on the rpg side though...Thanks again.

,RobiiNDownloadeR,2007-08-23T08:32Z,"Hi!
Just downloaded it, and deleted the sexy files... The trojan ones I mean.
Well, I can't get any game to work :S It just doesn't work. I doesnt work draging and dropping a game onto the emu, and Load game from the emu doesn't weork. Itdoesn't find any games? :S"
,RobiiNDownloadeR,2007-08-23T08:39Z,"No problem ;). I just cut n paste the folder into antoher HD. 

Well, is there any way to see the control setup? I just found out c is some button and enter is start xD"
,ihitterdal,2007-09-11T03:56Z,Can it hurt a Linux computer or can it only harm a Win?
,rikol,2008-03-02T19:24Z,tnx!!!
,blu35cr33n,2008-03-21T08:46Z,"Ran a scan on this with both AVG and Avira Antivir.
Nothing found, and the two HK files do run fine. Tested them on snes9x for psp, after adding the .smc extension. It just a series of pictures that you can cycle through. Pretty decent though, and not a bad collection of roms."
,Raethe,2008-04-08T10:47Z,"Ahh.....the system of my youth.   Let us all sit and pray, to the God's of Chrono, Lufia, Link, Megaman,  Ness, Terra, Bowser (hell, even Toad in Mario Kart...), Ryu, Leonardo, Higgins, Dogi, Ray....


Ok I'm going to stop now.  My list will ALWAYS go on for SNES....such a kick ass lineup of games, so many awesome characters.  Fuck the 360 and PS3.....SNES fucking owned."
,vidofnir13,2008-07-11T10:21Z,yeah theres no viruses... i scanned them too
,SoLiDMoNg00se,2009-03-20T10:27Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
Some people say Trojan, but that's not the point.
NONE of the files are named .smc, so zSnes does not pick them up.
If you use zSnes don't download this torrent unless you plan on adding .smc 750 times.

There's a torrent that houses 950 SNES roms. 
Download that one instead."
,patrickaghadjani,2009-06-28T03:22Z,"SoLiDMoNg00se your a fucking moron. 

Just because its not in .smc format that doesn't mean they don't work.

Use SNES and everything works fine. 

THANKS fggfgfgf!"
,LeDrewxcore,2009-07-03T01:35Z,"1) Download torrent.

2) Unzip the contents.

3) Delete all files that start with ""Anime,"" ""sex pics,"" and both files ""sexy HK girls.""

3) Download:
http://www.brothersoft.com/extension-renamer-download-41537.html

4) Install and put .smc in the ext section. Hit the GO button.

5) Done."
,scott_ehm,2009-12-05T22:21Z,Sweet emuator!
,NIGHT_TERR0R,2010-01-31T04:08Z,And also SoLiDMoNg00se i looked up your so called 950 roms and they are all .iso format one is also a cd creator....lol so unless you can show a link of where this 950 rom torrent is shut your mouth i cant see this one being that bad seeing at it has 107 seeders
,RIggsta,2010-04-29T06:44Z,"lame torrent...renaming doesnt work for all files, your left STLL with just a ""file"" a lot wont load"
,SatansCradle,2010-05-08T03:10Z,"Wow, I don't mean to sound like a dick, but people need to fucking experiment with options that are right in front of them instead of relying on others. In ZSNES check the box that says ""SHOW ALL EXTENSIONS"" before you load the game. It's that simple."
,boniac,2010-07-01T00:57Z,"Downloaded these for my PSP, they didnt work. Looks like the full set of roms but the extensions are messed up and dont load in Snesx9Euphoria"
,fozoid,2010-07-19T06:54Z,"i didn't use the emulator included because i've always used zsnes, anyways stop saying they don't work, you just don't know how to use them obviously. there is no renaming or adding extensions or downloading some stupid program to make these run on an emulator, since i always use zsnes here's how to play them.

Download the torrent

unzip it

copy the folder with all the roms in it and place it in your emulator folder (i use zsnes: http://www.zsnes.com/ )

with zsnes, open the emulator, Game > Load > in the Load Game screen at the bottom check the option that says ""show all extensions"" browse to the folder with the roms in it through the emulator, click the game you want to play...

Every emulator should have a similar option, just look for it, but zsnes is as good as any so i recommend downloading that one."
,GlycerinZ,2010-08-17T03:18Z,@Garfunker you are a retard
,GlycerinZ,2010-08-17T03:40Z,"Have some of you never heard of DOS? go into dos, get to the folder containing the roms, type

REN *.  *.SMC

DONE"
,.Angelus.,2010-08-20T05:31Z,"to play games on a emulator with a controller, use a regular corded x-box controller with the x-padder software. "
,ozmarch11,2010-10-16T15:58Z,what are those two viruses hopely not troijans if im not download
,Nexxion,2010-11-23T03:41Z,"Works great - Here's what you do need to do to clean it.

1) Download / Seed

2) Download a more up-to-date emulator. Vimm and Zophar's Domain are great places that hold these.

3) Open up the archive and copy the contents of ""Super Nintendo Roms"" to your ROM folder.

4) Open up your DOS prompt (you can just hit the start menu and run ""cmd.exe"")

5) Direct the command prompt to your ROM directory (for example ""cd\Program Files\Snes9x\ROMS\"")

6) Rename all files without an extension to .smc (""REN *. *.smc"") - Don't forget the space between the *. and the *.smc!

7) Open up your ROM folder and sort by size. Delete anything under 33KB. Files that small are demos or possibly worse. 

8) Search for the directory for anything that includes the words ""sex"", ""porn"", or ""rape"". Feel free to keep them if you wish to try them out and you're into that sort of thing. I personally find it safer to just delete the files and search for sex, porn, and rape on my own time.

9) There will be about 14 files that didn't get changed because they stupidly have periods in their name. (eg: Ms. Pac-Man) Simply rename these manually. 

10) Load the games up in your favorite emulator and enjoy! Almost every common game you can think of is here, though I've found that there are a couple more obscure ones such as ""The Magical Quest starring Mickey Mouse"" (Awesome game) are missing, but those are again easy to find online. This should be fine to get your collection most of the way there."
,gunmaker,2010-12-05T15:52Z,"new notice for distributers and to ALL TORRENT USERS

anti p2p organizations are now ddosing users and sending invalidated data OR VIRUSES into our torrents!!

this chocking of our extending seeding is halt !! -able!

download 

http://sourceforge.net/projects/peerblock/files/PeerBlock-Setup_v1.1_r518.exe/download

and prevent most of them from choking you, and rapidsearch for a non viral loic.exe so u can legally retaliate against them!
(ps if u do get a viraled loic.exe u can simply prune the viruses before u reboot, they sit in the main program files menu and a funny looking icon in there as well as your temp folders. simply delete them before rebooting.

THIS IS THE FUCKING PIRATE BAY! WE DONT TAKE CRAP FROM SCALLYWAGS! YARrRrR!"

,TheMightyTHOR,2011-04-24T23:49Z,just opened snes9x ant hit load rom and clicked the rom i wanted and it worked didnt have to change any names or anything. But i was wondering if it was possible to win the first fight that you are supposed to lose in breath of fire 2? because mine keeps giving me unlimited health which wouldnt be so bad after that fight
,TheMightyTHOR,2011-04-25T00:12Z,nvm its impossible but everytime i click no cheats it uses them anyway n im too lazy to figure out a way to fix it
