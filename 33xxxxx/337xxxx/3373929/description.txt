?Misty Fjords, Alaska? is much more than the scenery everybody has gotten used to these days. The unique combination of many features makes this the largest scenery project of its kind in the FS industry. It has many new features not seen before and is created by a team of more than 10 people !

?Misty Fjords? is so good that it could easily be used to show tourists around the famous Alaskan fjords region and the Inside Passage. In fact, that is what FSAddon is doing?. show you, the flightsimmer, what that part of Alaska looks like, in all its glory with life-like mountains, correctly placed and formed rivers, coastlines, lakes and roads, with hunters cabins strewn all over the fjords, harbors where they really are, life-like landclass, adjusted textures. Even the glaciers have their correct form.

Some special features include a custom made airstrip by Bill Womack (the Antelope Trail Ranch), custom made and moving cruise ships, the ability to ?freeze? lakes and streams and LAND on them, buoys with lights to enhance your VFR experience, custom made cabins by Mark Smith, custom seasonal textures (with support from FScene) and much, much more!!

This package is not only transforming the area in an Eldorado for bush pilots (which it does), but also provides a level of immersion for all other simpilots as well, even the Alaskan Air 737 flyer will want to have this one ! On top of it all Doug Linn has opened a dedicated website with (already !!) free add-ons to the Misty Fjords, flying guides for you to follow and more information to digest.

We think Misty Fjords will be the beginning of a whole new ?movement? in flightsimming, taking reality and immersion to yet another height and provding a base for many add-ons and activities !

Here are some of the features you will find in this package:

Base Landscape Features

    * accurate ocean and fjord shorelines, based on 1:63,360 (AK) and 1:50,000 (BC) hydrographic data, with custom seasonal shoreline textures.
    * accurate position of all lakes greater ~65ft/20m in diameter; all lakes have flat water surfaces; larger lakes have custom seasonal shoreline textures with wake action.
    * All ocean and lake islands greater ~65ft/20m in diameter.
    * all major rivers depicted as FS water (mesh-clinging).
    * small rivers and streams are placed to best fit the terrain mesh; very steep stream sections have a special "whitewater" texture.
    * LOD10 (38-m) base mesh (compatible with other LOD10 USGS NED add-on mesh), plus LOD8 buffer mesh to prevent "texture tearing" in the mid to far distance.
    * all major and minor settlements, with boundaries according to 1:63,360 (AK) and 1:50,000 (BC) topographic maps.
    * complete road network, except in places (e.g., settlements) where a dense road network would eliminate too many autogen buildings.
    * accurate position of forestry operations (clearcut logging and roads), based on satellite imagery and topographic maps.
    * best possible landclass file (i.e., land use types), hand-made based on Landsat 7 satellite imagery. All classes utilize custom seasonal textures, some of which are FScene textures used with permission from Ruud Faber.
    * custom waterclass file (i.e., water color), hand-made based on Landsat 7 satellite imagery. All classes utilize custom water colors. 

But there is more.....Enhanced Landscape Features

    * lakes and rivers can be made to "freeze" (i.e., have snow-covered hard ice surfaces); this requires switching of textures with batch files.
    * custom winter textures for streams.
    * all mountain glaciers, in particular their "toes"
    * special seasonal textures that reflect the long persistence of snow at higher elevations and in forestry cutblocks.
    * detailed rendition of Annette Island's unusual airfield (PANT) and its surrounding structures and landscape, based on online maps and photography.
    * custom AFCAD2 files for Ketchikan (PAKT; added new Taxiway B) and Annette Island (PANT), and the seaplane bases at Ketchikan (Ketchikan Intl-PANX; Ketchikan Harbor-5KE; Murphy's Pullout-8K9; Peninsula Point Pullout-9C0), Annette Island (Metlakatla-MTM; Tamgass Harbor-Z43), Thorne Bay (KTB), Meyer's Chuck (84K), Kasaan (KXA), Hollis (HYL), Loring (13Z), Bell Island Hot Springs (KBE), Yes Bay Lodge (78K), Hyder (4Z7), Stewart (CAC9), Silver City (CAC3), Kincolith (CBA3), Port Simpson (CAN8), and Prince Rupert (Seal Cove-CZSW; Digby Island-CAN6).
