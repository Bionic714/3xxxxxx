,lokean,2007-07-12T23:29Z,Very crappy encode.
,yoda-sama,2008-01-12T01:54Z,"WTF? Why aren't there subtitles?  I would LOVE to have some subs for this, anyone willing to make them or provide them?

And in regard to the video quality, while very far from dvd quality, it is better than an average letterboxed tape rip (not that I know the source).  The file size is more than overkill, though, for the overall low quality and the tiny resolution...

Anyways, subs would be really nice..."
,yoda-sama,2008-01-12T16:18Z,"Found this so far, and the translation looks to be better than the dubtitles that the DVD should have. You may want to play with the timing a bit on one of the later episodes, though.
