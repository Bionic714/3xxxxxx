Space Ghost (1966)

The original Hanna Barbera Space Ghost series!

Before there was Space Ghost Coast To Coast there was Jan and Jace and that stupid monkey. Cheesy goodness! Plus you get Zorak, Moltar and Brak!

The episodes listed on tv.com after episode 42 are Dino Boy. This is the full series.

Encoding is XviD with 128 bit mp3 sound (approximately 25mb per 6 minute episode). The rip is from DVD, but the original print isn't that great.

About four hours total video, so pull a bong hit and enjoy. :)

And of course, be cool, help seed the file for a while after you finish.
