From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

Ross Friedman (born Australia) is a guitarist best known for performing with the Heavy Metal band Manowar.
After moving to New York City Friedman joined the New York based punk band The Dictators as guitarist in 1975. After recording 3 albums with them Friedman went to France and worked for one year in Shaking Street. On Black Sabbath's Heaven and Hell tour in 1980 (on which Shaking Street were the support act) Friedman met bass player Joey DeMaio. Later in 1980 Friedman and DeMaio formed Manowar with whom he recorded six albums before leaving the band after the 1988 album Kings of Metal to pursue more blues oriented material.
