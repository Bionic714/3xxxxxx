A lot of classic spacerock bands and a few new ones. Some of the newer bands featured on this three CD compilation are totally unknown to me, the music is good tho. Die hard Hawkwind fans might want to check this out just to hear a couple of rare tracks.

Steven McDonald, All Music Guide:
three-CD compilation that does a nice job of sampling the space music genre, opening with a fairly rare Hawkwind remix. Rather than stay with the crunchy end of the space music genre, however, the compilation wanders off into ambient productions, drones, electronic experiments, techno, trance and more, taking in the well-known and the obscure (it's nice to see Alien Planetscapes wandering beyond the cassette underground.) Shading in at just under four hours, this compilation makes an essential primer.
