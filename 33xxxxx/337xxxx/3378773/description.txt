"Ryan focuses on the relationship between creator Chris Landreth and Ryan Larkin. Landreth uses actual recordings of his conversations with Ryan and animates them using a technique he calls ?psycho-realism?- his characters are drawn in a way that allows their inner scars to be seen externally."

This animation is an orgy between creativity and imagination. You have to understand that this is a documentary about Ryan Larkin, A Canadian who pioneered animated drawings in the late 1960's. 
So, it is a documentary about the fall of an artist, a pioneering animator, by an animator, through animation. It is a view of life at its rawest. Enjoy.
