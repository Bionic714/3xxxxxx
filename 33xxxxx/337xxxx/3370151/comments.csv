,MiZFiT,2005-08-16T02:36Z,"Zenzei: Hicks is totally cool, and it's true that Leary stole some bits (smoking thing in particular).. but to say he stole all his material?? I like the angry drunk irish guy, he IS a shitty actor though..... Thnx upper, been looking for lock'n'load"
,scavenga,2005-08-16T11:56Z,"Great share, I have No Cure, but need LocknLoad as well. ""Download Bill Hicks in stead""? Why not both?

And the DVD format is appreciated, fanx!"
,charliechuck,2005-08-16T12:44Z,"this is no use, it is too big to fit on 1 dvd-r as most are only 4.7gb in size, could you maybe bring this file down in size? i'm sure it would be a much more popular download. denis leary is one cool dude! :)"

,assa55,2006-08-12T03:37Z,"So fucking what if he stole some material from bill hicks, he's good at it, that is what's matters."
,assa55,2006-08-12T03:39Z,"it's 4.36 gb large it fits on a dvd, jackass"
,black francis,2006-08-28T10:21Z,"zenzei you should check you information mister. If you didn't know, Bill Hicks co-wrote ""no cure for cancer"" and co-produced the show. Denis Leary is a very good performer and presents a very unique approach to comedy. His high paced, high energy driven style is like no other. If someone has a copy of the MTV-Unplugged by Denis Leary and the possibility to upload it I would be forever grategul. These two shows are great, but the unplugged is a rare gem that's seemingly hard to find. I saw it on MTV years ago and recorded it to a VHS, but the tape is all worn and the sound and picture quality is crap, otherwise I'd upload it myself. Cheers."
,RoyalSoldier,2007-04-03T00:11Z,"eh damn idiots ITS not to big for a normal DVD-disc.

Jackass the movie 2 was 4.46 gib and it works burning it on a regular DVD disc

Thanks for UL"
,mickey_mouse,2007-04-14T01:10Z,"Denis Leary are cool! Rescue Me Forever! For u who havent saw it, SEE IT! "
,gofeta,2007-10-30T17:16Z,more seeds?! or is it getting to old?
,robbans_69,2007-12-24T15:30Z,Tackar för denna har haft dom förut men tappat bort dom... saknat dom...bra roliga...
,Runff,2008-04-02T22:16Z,"Zenzei before you go on throwing accusations you should consider the following argument:
While some who saw Hicks around 1990 may get that impression, the accusations lose force when one considers that Leary's persona and act were already established on the Boston comedy scene in the early to mid-1980s.

The thing Hicks got angerd by was the Lock and load album. The persona and attitude many would argue Hicks infact stole from Leary"
,Runff,2008-04-02T22:22Z,"First of all sorry I meant no cure for cancer not lock and load

on the other hand black francis where do you find the info that Hicks ever co-wrote the show with Leary, if this were true why all the controvercy."
,Sikkwolf,2009-03-11T19:27Z,"Zenzie = Nigger

Fuck you faggots, if you don't like Leary, go download Hicks and watch him and him only, keep your fucking pole smoking opinions out other comedians torrents.... Fucking niggers, Jesus."
,Mr.Dark.Epic,2009-04-18T04:13Z,"Despite what I see, angry people, Thanks for the torrent..... I love Leary."
