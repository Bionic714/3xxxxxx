,elevenbravo,2008-04-04T06:28Z,This is bunk. I've installed CDRWIN 4.0G and it doesn't even associate .cdr files with it. There are *no* options within CDRWin to read or write .cdr files. Tried to rename to .iso but that didn't work. Read through endless forum threads about .cdr file (not the CorelDraw files either). Complete waste of time - don't bother.
