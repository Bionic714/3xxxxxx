Having a issue using the Patch UpDate :-(

The md5 that comes the the archieve is not the same as generated by various md5 programs.  

as per the Generic-Tiger.md5 file: e78fe52e30a1f8c5b29d4b7932a16c5e

as per my md5 generator:
e51addef4d8bbb3443ab73d817efba8c

therefore the patch will not install correctly."

Reporting sucess in Toshiba satellite A75. I burned the ISo and it booted without any problem. Thanks for this. This is a osx86 10.4.1 edition. I will try an upgrade to 10.4.3 and report back.
I have no sound and no wireless and it's a bit slow, kind of sticky and cpu usage is high. ANY IDEAS"

Don't just uninstall because of no internet, dammit!

You should check out osx86project.org for some more info.

By the way, if you want, I could write a driver for your wireless card and/or your ethernet port. I just need the name/ids of it, and if I feel up to it some day."
