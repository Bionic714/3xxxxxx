Title: Le Dernier Combat
Director: Luc Besson
Codec: Xvid

Description: In the setting of a scarcely populated post-apocalyptic world a solitary figure builds a flying machine and lands in a desolate city. He joins a doctor who has fortified himself in a clinic and helps him defend against the constant attacks of a hostile barbarian. This movie has few characters and no spoken dialogue! Besson's first feature-length film is definitely one of his best.
