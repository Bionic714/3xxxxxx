,byrnsus,2009-07-19T03:29Z,"how to make this torrent work

first go into username/downloads/Command and Conquer - Generals/Keygen/ and double click the keygen icon and hit generate, this will be the cd key you will use

2. then fire up daemon tools and mount the file at the directory below

username/downloads/Command and Conquer - Generals/Game Images/blas_c+c_gen

3. the autorun should go up and you should install it



when it asks for cd2, unmount the drive go into the same /game images/ directory and mount /blas_c+c_gen2/

4. when it is done, go into /username/downloads/Command and Conquer - Generals/No-Cd Crack

5. copy the .dat file in that folder and paste it in 

EA GAMES/Command and Conquer Generals/

6. say yes when it asks if you want to replace the original file

7. go back into the no cd crack folder and copy the generals shortcut icon and paste it in the same folder as the .dat file

8. this will be the shortcut you will use to start generals from now on, use no other, you may even want to replace the shortcut on your desktop with this specific icon.
