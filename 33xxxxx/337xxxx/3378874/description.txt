Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure [DVD ISO] [www.projectblack.com]

Keanu Reeves (The Matrix) and Alex Winter (The Lost Boys) deliver "spirited performances" (The Hollywood Reporter) in the original righteous comedy about the two ditzy dudes from San Dimas, California.  Also starring George Carlin, this hysterically funny historical comedy is a "snappily directed" (Time), "bouncy good time" (The Boston Globe), and a party that goes on and on!

Bill (Winter) and Ted (Reeves) have spent so much time forming their rock band, The Wyld Stallyns, that they're flunking history.  Woah, duuuude! And when Ted's dad threatens to send him away to military school, Bill and Ted realize it could mean the most heinous end of The Stallyns!  Luckily, a guardian angel from the future, Rufus (Carlin), has come to them with a most bodacious solution:  a time-traversing phone booth to take them into the past to learn about the world from some of history's most influential personalities!  Their journey through time turns out to be a blast... but will they learn enough to pass their class?
