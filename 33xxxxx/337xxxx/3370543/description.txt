Lost and Delirious by LÃ©a Pool is probably my personal favourite drama about young lesbian love, and without the shadow of a doubt it is one of the world's five or ten best. There are a lot of things I don't understand, but if any lesbian (or any girl for that matter) does not fall in love with the three girls of this film, I would be baffled [but I guess I just wouldn?t want to see things in another way :)]

Whatever your feelings about this film, it can be viewed from two standpoints: As a love story between girls, or as a film about your own emotional love life. The three main characters have very different personalities. Within us, these girls can be said to portray three facets of a woman in love with another woman. There's the passionate, fierce and craving desire that will stop at nothing to be able to share her love with the girl of her dreams; there's the fear of accepting one self as the lesbian you are, of leading a life not accepted by friends and family, unsure of how much in love you are and unsure of what you can allow yourself to do and what sacrifices you are willing to make; there's the 'Mouse' within us (the name chosen for one of the characters) that is the observer who tries to understand what is going on, learning as she lives but shyly and confused, at first shying from what she sees both on the outside and within herself.

Seen on this 'internal level' the ending isn't as coarse as it may be perceived just watching it on a superficial level; it has an every-day real meaning to many of us.

Words set aside; the most important aspect of this film is emotion. Hope you'll all love it, girls.
