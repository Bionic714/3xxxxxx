Producer Harvey Kahn (ROW YOUR BOAT) takes a turn at directing in this star-powered thriller set in the near future. A war in the Middle East has made gas prices skyrocket, and investment banker Tom Hanson (Christian Slater, VERY BAD THINGS) is approached to investigate a deal to take over a huge Russian oil company. As it becomes increasingly clear that there are some shady dealings going on--though obfuscation on exactly what may stem from writer and former Goldman-Sachs employee Ruth Epstein's familiarity with overly-technical matters--Tom succeeds in hiring a new recruit, the ecologically-minded Abby (Selma Blair, HELLBOY). Love blossoms, but is interrupted by the appearance of femme fatale Anna (Angie Harmon, LAW & ORDER), who seduces him. Ultimately, however, Tom begins to realize both the implications of the deal with which he is enmeshed, as well as the true intentions of his new paramour.
