This is a complete (unshrunk) copy of the DVD but there are no menus or extras,
just the movie. That's how it was released (in China).
The subtitles are embedded in the video and can not be turned off. They are
unfortunately a little hard to read. Even so, if you like Chinese cinema its well
worth the download.
