An i have tried to patch it whit fernandos patch but it didn't work. Is this patch a diffrent one.Because the patch that i downloaded was from pesinsight.com and that one didn't work. I read there that u can't patch and iso that is a copy. Please can someone confirm this. Or tell me what to do. Or maybe upload the game in english.
