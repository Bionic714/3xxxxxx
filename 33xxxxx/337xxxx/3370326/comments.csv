,Trivial10,2005-08-16T22:16Z,Den crackade mappen hittar du under Spel/ Mac och torrenten under Sims 2 spelet. Den är på 7 MB och tar inte speciellt lång tid att ladda ner. Lycka till. Hör av dig om du inte lyckas hitta den. 
,Trivial10,2005-08-16T22:17Z,"Här är länken till den crackade applikationen.

,TheGoodDoctorFunk,2006-03-13T21:13Z,"I did the same thing, and it still won't work. What am I doing wrong? :("
,mygirl,2006-03-15T09:40Z,"are there any english instructions from any of the 7254 downloaders on how to install and play this properly? step by step would be helpful to lots of us, ""THANK YOU!!!"" to whoever does it!"

,FlavaMatic,2006-04-15T08:50Z,"Hi, how can I play this after patched to Rev. D (Universal Binary) without making it to an Power PC App again?

I have installed/re-installed game, Rev E, and run patch many times. Mac has more than enough power. As soon as I try to enter 'a lot' it crashes. Have checked memory - no problems with anything else. Any ideas out there? Is it something to do with not being registered?"

Just mount, and drag folder to HD and open up Sims 2!
Seeding til July 1st."
,happyxme,2008-06-27T04:33Z,"Ok, so I downloaded this, dragged it to my hd and can play it without any cracks.  I meet and exceed the specs and all is fine when I start to build my own town, but when I play another previously made town it crashes and then takes me to my desktop and tells me that it quit unexpectedly.  

I have tried to apply 3 different cracks but after I do so, it asks me for the disc.  What am I doing wrong?  Could someone link me to a crack that will solve this problem pretty please??  Sorry to bother!"
,Silencio223,2008-07-23T01:52Z,"I got this working, after a bit of effort. None of the patches/crack combinations I tried worked, so just mount the toast file, drag the folder to your applications folder and run.
Also, if your game crashes upon entering a lot, move the family out, then into another lot. You can move them back afterwards, but certain combinations of families and lots cause the crash. Good luck! :o)"

,bmraxim,2011-04-10T18:00Z,"The description translates to from swedish to english:


So this is the new game Sims 2. It is a toast image and contains everything needed to play. Open the image and copy it into the Applications folder. Download the cracked app and copy it into the same folder. Start the game through the cracked application. It can be found in the torrent below. 

I have a really lousy upload speed. (1 Mbps) I'm trying to download a little while and the speed is not the best. But please, try not to complain to much. It gets so boring. I'm trying to seed this until a few downloaded it and can seed further. 

Trist with complaints and I'm trying, anyway. Is not expert at understanding exactly how it works. Good luck and have fun. So this is the new game Sims 2.
