I'd have to say THE best aircraft for Fs2004, the Virtual Cockpit is GREAT! :)"
,flightmaster,2005-08-18T07:41Z,"Agree. Best VC gauges ever made, great stall buffeting, excellent hand flyer. Cruises at 0 lbs boost. Don't exceed 8 lbs boost for takeoff, or you'll find yourself in the gutter next to the runway ;-)"

""You MUST copy all the folders - a/c , texture etc.. to the fs9 root directory...""

But in the FS2004 root folder there already exist folders named Aircraft, Texture...etc.  These would be overwritten, wouldn't they?  Or am I missing something?

Regards
