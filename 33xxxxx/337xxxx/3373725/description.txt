'John Safran's Music Jamboree reveals all ? the drum, the dirt and the bittersweet memories. Here are the classics and forgotten flops, stories of gigs and groupies, guns, drugs, deals and egos and the scams and scandals brought to light by his very own music "mole", not to mention practical advice on how to make it in the savage world of rock 'n' roll.'


This is a show John Safran had in 2003, before 'John Safran VS God'. Interesting and very funny, especially if you're into music.
