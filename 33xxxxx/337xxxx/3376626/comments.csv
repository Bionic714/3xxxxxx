,wendriner,2006-05-09T14:04Z,"Anybody with the problem that neither Ceaser III nor Zeus does not start installing after pressing install button? Poseidon would work, but there is no point in there... very frustrating as I've been looking for these for a long time..."
,mahiji,2006-05-13T18:36Z,SEED PLZ!!!!!!
,tlarseth,2006-07-15T19:24Z,"Read the Discription, this does include Cleopatra.

As for the file size, I own this collection and Ceasar III is 680 MB, or somewhere around there, it barely fits on normal CDs.  The reason for that was with the collection they make a few changes to the installer files and it ended up causing an increase in file sizes."
,tlarseth,2006-07-17T12:02Z,"As for Zeus not stating the install once you press install, is that you have to wait a few for it to start.  I had to wait about 30 seconds for the installer to begin working.  If it takes longer than 1 minute, might want to upgrade your antivirus software, as you probably have a virus on your system.

I have not tested Ceasar III yet, installing it later on, will post wiether or not it works."

,fireblade80,2008-11-06T20:24Z,"Excellent torrent! Thanks a lot!

These games are legends among city-builder fans and they are very hard to find now in stores."

,Luisb1978,2008-11-25T21:15Z,"I can't make Zeus works on my pc, i had vista, somebody knows about a patch or emulator, or how i had to configure my computer to make it run, i don't had any trouble with Caesar III"
,TerraBit,2010-02-28T09:18Z,Great Torrent :) Downloaded At Roughly 1MB/s Of Course Using A Seedbox :P
,mw2merc,2012-08-23T08:22Z,"THX! This is a good collection. If you wanna convert to ISO format, use AnyToISO. Working on WineSkin versions of these. So far, only Pharaoh with Cleopatra works."
,mw2merc,2012-08-23T08:24Z,"For Mac that is. ;p Use Alcohol 120 if you just wanna mount the images to play. As long as a CD copy is in the drive or image mounted, should work no problem."
