Portuguese -> Galera ta funcionando na boa..."
,seif13,2012-08-03T14:00Z,"@vkkkr Has your brain been fucked with or are you just stupid? Some people actually enjoy the good old games, and the title clearly said Project IGI 1. So why the fuck are you telling us to download when we wanted to? Is it because it's not what you wanted? Is it because you can't read properly? You sir, just went full retard.

Oh and don't bother trying to correct my spelling and grammar for me because you don't have a comeback. Nothing's wrong anyway. So if you try to sink that low I'm just telling you, you're gonna have a bad time, bitch.

Anyway, great ass torrent man, works perfect. Gonna try and seed it."
,legnakrad,2012-08-13T05:04Z,"hell-o

can someone confirm if the game is playable until the end or if it really crasheswhatever in the 4th/10th level as was reported before ?
