,PirateKnaz,2006-02-11T20:34Z,"plz host heretic 1 in another torrent,i want heretic only,message me if this is done"
,PirateKnaz,2006-02-11T21:49Z,useless files
,prefuse,2006-02-14T09:52Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD

games will not work in windows xp, 2000, etc...

these are junk files"
,PhakeDC,2006-02-17T18:16Z,Why are you saying this? You can emulate pretty much any DOS game using DOSBox or VDMSound!
,prefuse,2006-02-19T23:26Z,"DOSbox and VDMSound will only emulate games with valid/working files

these are not valid/working files

JUNK FILES

REPEAT:  DO NOT DOWNLOAD"
,WiwuX,2006-02-20T17:08Z,You can just switch system compatability. Not particularly hard.
,ZipoBibrok,2006-03-05T20:22Z,"Everything which doesnt work in XP or 2000 are not junk files, many people have a dedicated retro machine which runs these games nicely."
,Ready1,2006-04-27T13:05Z,some ppl just dont know the beauty of playing the original fps.... fkn newbies piss off!!
,bimpus,2006-05-07T00:18Z,"Håller Med!

Varför gnälla??????
Någon som tagit sig tid för att göra en torrent är en trevlig kille/tjej.

Ni som bara gnäller o gnäller! Gå och köp orginalen istället! Den som lägger upp torrents tjänar inga pengar osv.

Har lust att strypa vissa som piper över minsta lilla! Borde göras om så att man måste regga sig för att få ladda ner. Gnälls det så åker man ut!  Delar man inte ut minst 48h efter nedladdning ska man också ut!

Att gnälla på spyware mm är helt okej!
Men får man något GRATIS så får man ta det som det är!
Gillar man det inte så ta bort det man ladda ner då bara! Finns inga problem!

Ha en riktig trevlig vår ni alla som lägger upp torrenter! 90% av oss är tacksamma in i gatan.

Ska göra en FaQ om hur man:
Packar upp, mountar, bränner, var finns cracken mm så slipper vi lägga tid på gnäll.

,flamecsm101boy,2006-06-24T09:12Z,"anyone besides me ever played both terminal velocity and fury 3?
because to me, they are remarkably similar, minus the fact that TV is dos based and fury3 is win9x based?"
,Fatguy5000,2006-06-26T14:26Z,"please re-seed this one, i must have some of these games!!"
,Firemaniac,2006-07-02T15:24Z,Plz seed anyone
,crazytnt,2006-11-06T01:07Z,Descent 2 is missing INTRO-H.MVL  (containing Intro and ending movies in 640x480) and OTHER-H.MVL  (containing escape sequences and entering-system movies in 640x480) Plz send @ buttman_380@hotmail.com. if you don't have those look for the lower res ones (Name has -L insted of -H)
,samuraidd,2006-12-29T05:40Z,"Great games... Bu the one I want most has a strange error. In Die By The Sword, I can run Arena and Tutorial fine, but when I try to enter Quest or Tournament, the game logo with a CD below appears and says ""Press alt-F4 to quit"". Thinking it maybe a loading screen or something, but nothing happens. I check the task manager and it says the program is active, but if I press alt-F4 it makes me force it shut. Anyone know what to do?"
,mrblah,2006-12-31T02:28Z,"Die by the Sword works fine. Even XP if you put it to 98 compatibility. You just need to get a no-cd crack.
Found one that works here:

,mrblah,2006-12-31T02:34Z,"BTW someone seed Interstate 76, I lost my play disc (disc 2) years ago and would like to enjoy it again."
,killabeast,2007-01-29T18:45Z,PLZ Can you seed:)
[T],__X-Man__,2007-02-17T10:14Z,I don't have it anymore. And it is NOT junk as the one mofo guy pointed out here.
,Henrik112,2007-04-25T23:20Z,Any who know if the Terminator future shock is the full version ? thanks in advance :-)
,FkdMdd,2007-06-04T06:08Z,"Hi everybody. I actually had a problem with ""Die by the sword"". It seems that most of the games work ok, in windows xp or in DOSBox, but DBTS does not work in anyway. I was looking for any ""windows 95"" emulator but I didn't find any... but I found a program for linux called wine. May be that is the solution.
What do you think? Did you have the same problem? How did you the game work?
Thank you."
,X138,2007-07-07T19:11Z,"Does anyone know how to get these to work?

I tried loading them in DOSBOX but they don't open. "
,djnforce9,2007-11-18T06:06Z,"Yes, it's not junk. prefuse fails to realize that the exe files are actually ARCHIVES. You can extract them with winrar to get to the actual games. You DON'T run those exes in dosbox."
,N-drju,2008-03-25T13:01Z,"It looks okay, I managed to launch Hexen 2 for instance. Hope it will work right. ;) The only disadvantage is that you have to uncheck the files you don't want to download, it takes some of the precious time."
,Wormicle,2008-08-16T21:24Z,"""Junk files, it doesn't work, don't download"".
Or to put it another way:
""I'm a fucking retard noob who doesn't know how to use the computer my parents bought me to shut me up"".
These work perfectly, thanks for the upload."
,gravesite,2008-12-17T08:32Z,"I just down loaded one game out the bunch. Oh, the old Dos Prompt!  For those too young to know what is DOS?-Disk Operating System.  I am Disappointed on the readme file in some other fuc crap than english.."
,kolosus2,2008-12-24T03:29Z,"I am Disappointed on the readme file in some other fuc crap than english..

So. Someone in a foreign land somewhere made this collection, and you're saying ""fuc crap than english..""? Come on! Maybe the world doesn't revolve around english. Granted that it does good as the common denominator but maybe someone doesn't care. I think the proper responce would be for someone to step up and put forth a set with english readme files."
,davidsolomon83,2009-07-01T10:49Z,"JUNK FILES ?? Huh,

all saying this are impotent NOOBIES, you useless lot we still sucking your milk !!

These are classic games, GEMS fags, do your research properly you nit witts, google these and you'll know that the fancy shit you get these days have all been developed from these games.

NOOBES, SORE NOOBES, LOL"
,snipershock76,2009-07-19T03:55Z,"i used to play dtbs wheni was younger, i think it was a great game, hopefully it works. has anybody tried it on windows xp 2000? do i need a emulater? "
