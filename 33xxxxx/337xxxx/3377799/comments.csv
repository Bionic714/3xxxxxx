,melissathebirdlover,2006-12-05T07:42Z,"I tried this version.. It works great.. Very Fast.. I am using it on a EN1 AMD 64 with 1gb of ram. It was pretty easy setting up dual boot. Windows XP/OSX. Thanks Viper!

Pros:
Easy to burn and install. 
Very Easy for making Drivers for my AC97 sound card and LinkSys Network card.. 
Dual boot
Fast


Cons:
Sarfai works fast! however flash will not install/work. :-(
Firefox 1-2.0 will not start.. Have to use version 0.9
It seems like there is alot of programs that won't work. 


Other Programs I have tried within This Version:
Quake 3 (Video card error. You mite have better luck I have a mx4000).

Photoshop 7.0 Worked!
Imovie Worked great!
Itunes Worked
Iphoto Worked
