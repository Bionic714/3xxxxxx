,scavenga,2005-08-16T11:54Z,"One thing I've been wondering about regarding downloading these OSX system discs, won't there be any SN or identity issues when installing (and using) these?"
,deg,2005-08-16T12:17Z,I think you need marklar for that
,snakus,2005-08-16T13:52Z,The iso is made from .dmg files there's no serial number. If someone test it please write some comments.
,jobolo,2005-08-17T02:20Z,"huh? is this a normal tiger version? If yes, why posting it then ???????? 
Tiger install needs a bit more then 642 megabytes..."

,queche,2006-02-11T13:24Z,can someone pls expain the best way to burn this file on a pc for use on a mac (bootable) my mac is dead and need this to do a recover.
,soupiously,2006-03-01T18:06Z,"i used ultraISO...
change the properties of the iso to mac HFS+ 
worked for me...thanks a bunch!"
,toona,2006-03-04T20:06Z,"Here's the deal guys: 

This is DISK 1 out of 4 disks. The problem with many of the current ""kits"" of the Tiger install CDs online is that the first CD is not made to be bootable, which is why this has been uploaded. You need all four disks to fully install Tiger, this will only get you started. Do NOT PARTIALLY INSTALL. I did that and I am out of use of a computer untill this is done downloading. 

have fun. "
,toona,2006-03-05T00:41Z,"i can verify that this disk is bootable and starts the installation. ""D"
,Ashuram,2006-03-12T06:18Z,"Ok... so this is just the first CD in the Tiger installer. Please, I need the rest of the CDs! There are plenty of single diskimages from the DVD version but that's not very useful to me since my mac don't have a DVD reader/burner. 

So... the rest of the CD... please...?... Anyone? "
,hakujin,2006-03-18T23:25Z,"Arigato for this!
 Looking forward to the next 3 CDs 
;-)"
,wepoo,2006-03-25T06:47Z,Has anyone else had an issue with the iso not being readable? In both XP and OS X it says that the file is not recognised.

,timp74,2008-05-27T14:28Z,"Cool!  Thanks Snakus.  

I now my first mac working like a dream.   He's call moses as I found him in the rubbish by the banks of the A1(main road in London).

 Its a Power Mac G4 AGP, I burnt all the disks from windows using ImgBurn.  Disk 2,3 & 4(From the 'other' torrent) I converted to ISO first with UltraISO.  Both utils are free.

Is there a ISO bootable version of 9.2.2 out there somewhere too?"
,albumgeek,2008-06-06T23:43Z,"If anyone can help I would really appreciate it! When I put this in my G4 iMAC it recognizes it as an installation disc but when I try to install nothing happens. I hold down the option key and it gives me the option to boot from the HD or the CD but when I choose CD the white apple screen comes up for a few minutes and then it flickers and then I get the a blank blue screen. This is my first mac and I bought it used with no admin password. I can get into one of the user accounts and when I put the disc in while it's booted it gives me the option to install but then it won't let me from that user account without the admin password. Can anyone tell me if I'm doing something wrong, or how to get past this? "
,stinkingshoe,2008-06-08T22:25Z,"you COULD reset the root password...

hold down cmd(apple key on older keyboards) and ""s"" when you turn your computer on... after chime you should get a bunch of text, as it is now in ""single user mode""

type: mount -uw /

then type: passwd root

enter a password for root, note that it will not actually show you've typed anything. After typing a password, hit enter, and it will prompt you to type it a second time.

Then type: shutdown -r now

your computer will restart, and you can use the username: root
with whatever password you made to install things, or you could just use root to change your actual admin account password :)"
,NeonGerbil,2008-06-21T10:18Z,"I just downloaded this.

I loaded it up with ImgBurn. It listed it as ""Unknown"", but burned it just fine!

Anyone else have anything to say on the subject?"

,driver76,2009-08-29T23:37Z,"What the hell is the point in this. Yeah, CD1 works but you MUST have the second CD becasue the system files are over 800mb. Yeah you can stop the installation of printer drivers, but you CANT stop the installation of languages.

Was the original uploader having a laugh or something?

And to all those who said they got it working they are full of shit. Installation of this torrent is impossible without CD 2.

Anyway, I curse the fucking Day I bought a Mac. Ive been stuck on Panther OSX 10.3 which is totally useless today. Cant even run a single browser properly. Apple definitely make it so you upgrade your computers. Fucking Wanky Communist company..."
,driver76,2009-08-29T23:55Z,"Alright my bad the uploader wasnt being an arse. His intention was to upload an actual bootable disk image and this I can confirm it is.  His reason must have been because of the amateur Apple Mac users who simply upload a file of various OSX versions without making a genuine copy of the disk (In this Case a 100% replication = ISO)...but no no, most amteur apple fanboy users simply click copy on to the disk and think their making a 100% copy hence the reason why there are soooo many shit OSX copies uploaded that just will not work. They forget that a copy will not duplicate the boot info...retards...but thats so typical of Mac users as they are not computers savvy at all. NEVER had any such issues with Win XP systems.


Anyway, this guy was good, just a pity he didnt include disk 2"
