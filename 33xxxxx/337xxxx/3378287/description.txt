Doctor Who - Castrovalva
Part 4

Tegan and Nyssa help the newly regenerated Doctor back to the TARDIS, but the Master kidnaps Adric, who uses the boy's mental abilities to project a fake Adric on board and programme the Doctor's time machine to head back to the Hydrogen inrush that created the universe, which will destroy the craft. The Doctor starts to recover, and tells Tegan how to escape. When the TARDIS lands on Castrovalva, the local inhabitants are all too happy to help with the Doctor's recovery but he realises something is wrong. The whole city is another one of Adric's projections.
