These are some Videos I made using FRAPS and Battlfield 1942, instead of normal Battlfield 1942 I used the Mod called XWW2 (www.xww2.com) it is probably the best Battlfield 1942 out there.

So enjoy the videos.

P.S They have just realeased an new version of XWW2 V2.6 download it , they made the best even better
