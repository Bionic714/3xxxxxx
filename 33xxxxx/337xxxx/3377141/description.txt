Notes: 

  After a busy 2004 summer festival season with just one guitarist, Beseech 
  recruited Manne Engstr√∑m (Fatal Embrace, Sundown, Cemetery) to fatten 
  their overall sound. With fresh blood in the band, Beseech began writing 
  new material and quickly the tracks took shape becoming more mature and 
  complex than ever before. Following a 6-month recording period, "Sunless 
  Days" finally saw the light. 

  This is the limited digipack edition with two bonus tracks. In stores on 
  Sept 5th 2005.
