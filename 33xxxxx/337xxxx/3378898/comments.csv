,themano,2007-02-18T05:49Z,"Download and install Alcohol 120%'s trial.

Reboot.

Mount this in the free trial version of Alcohol 120%.

Download the trial version of Macdrive 6.1.5.

Reboot.

Use the cd copy to cd copy feature of Alcohol 120%.

Check the box that makes it go on the fly, and change the read speed of the virtual drive to 1x, also tell it to burn RAW and ignore errors.

Click next, then change your burner to burn as slow as it possibly can and then click finish.

If you can use a buffer underrun protection, use it.

This should create a bootable disc, it has worked for me just fine.


And for future reference, when someone makes a file to share via torrent, don't use a stupid .rar file split crap thing, it just takes longer to download."

Mount with alcohol to virtual drive
start nero...
bij making image before burning nero give a big list of errors.
I guess this rarfile is damaged.
I can try one more time with macdrive as described by thermano and let you know if it works.
By the way, i have alcohol payed, that must be allright."

,exeon_Zechs,2009-06-17T06:21Z,"jherix, rar is an archive. you must unarchive them first."
