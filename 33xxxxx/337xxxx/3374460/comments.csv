,jj421,2010-03-29T23:40Z,"Thanks soo much! Hardly any seeders but I am getting 25 KB/s on just peers so it'll be finished in a couple minutes. I am going to seed as long as I can. This is the best addon EVER! Tons of animations, beautifully done island, and best of all, it's frame rate friendly. If anybody wants a link to it, here you go:

Posted there are also the minimum requirements, which they are pretty low. I had this on my laptop which was just below those requirements and as long as if I had traffic turned off and scenery complexity low, it worked fine. Now, I can't wait to see just how well it runs on my new system. My new computer almost quadruples those requirements! :)

Thanks again!! :)

P.S. It just finished downloading! :) Going to seed now! :) I like smileys! :) "
