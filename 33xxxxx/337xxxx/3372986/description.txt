V0.7
----
- no longer need of removing UMD while selectiong ISO - just insert any UMD at startup and play around !
- even more compatible (RR works now, others possibly too ...)
- Possibility to start inserted UMD from selection menu (to allow overclocking)
- New backpic ("V0.7") for ISOMISC/
- integrated UMD dumper with splitting, pausing and USB function !
  - Dumps the inserted UMD into the ISO/ drawer ("My latest Dump") if no splitting is selected
  - Dumps to ISOSPLIT/ drawer ("My latest Dump_Part #") on splitting
    - Splitting of the files can be in 10 MB, 20 MB, 50MB, 100MB, 200MB, 400MB and 800 MB chunks
    - Auto pause mode ("*autopause*") : Pauses the dumping once a splitpart reached the selected size,
      so you can turn on USB (triangle), save the part to the PC, delete from MemStick after and
      go on with the dumping of the next part (resume with square)
    - Splitted parts can be concated together with "copy /b" for example
  - ***** Warning : The dumper DOESNT check the free space on Memstick for now ! *****
          (Make sure it fits before, either splitted or unsplitted !)
  - ***** Make sure you add a drawer ISOSPLIT/ on the root of your MemStick ! *****
