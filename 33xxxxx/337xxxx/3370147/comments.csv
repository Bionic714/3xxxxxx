,smumdax,2007-12-22T11:38Z,"Mail Bomber isn't a virus in itself. I actually use it regularly to send my newsletter. It can, however, be used to spam and it does get detected by my antivirus software (AVG) as a Trojan-flood virus. Technically, if someone gets inside your computer, then they could use this program to send smap. It is a small program, and that is why it's, well, small... lol

I'm downloading it back because I can't get my antivirus software to release it from it's quarantine. Bummer."

Mail Bomber lets you send email using mailing lists. It also allows you to create and manage mailing lists, and automatically generate messages from predefined templates directly.

You can create mailing lists and save them as separate files BML. Each file may contain information not only on the containers, but SMTP servers and messages.

The interface is simple and manageable. Almost all functions are accessible from the keyboard, which adds more functionality.

You can use it as a tool to keep in touch with your customers or users, such as a mailing list manager, such as an address book or as a quick mail client."
,XyberB,2011-03-15T18:43Z,NOD32 does see this as a trojan (mailflooder) - HOWEVER it is safe to disarm the virusscanner to install this application. Works perfectly. Be sure to reactivate virusscanner after install.
