Never thought I would see the day Etree stuff would be banned here, wow! Dime doesn't even go that far. Well maybe some want to kiss up, but I'm not not. Gail kiss my ass! Screwing us once more, I won't forget! So I guess the Z soundboards and audience tapes, and video of Ahmet and Dweezil are not welcome here either? 
So is it just ZPZ or anything Dweezil? The Zappa shows w/ Dweezil? What? 
I know one thing, hell if I'm buying anything from this tour! Hey, it's not Frank, so I could care.

I was hot when i wrote that, and I'm still pissed. I guess I'm biased because people like Ad, and Tom Brown are friends and the way Gail treated these fans, I will never forget. I feel screwed royal by her. It's going to be difficult now to secure shows, and that sucks. I understand the owners of this site. I guess if it was me, i would do it anyway as I would love to get them in court. I would make such a stink! I would counter sue, hire Jeffery Fieger and burn as many of their millions off as I can. I may see Dweezil, and I will let him know how I feel, no doubt! 
It happens we have mutual friends, and I could meet him if I wish, but now, not sure that is a good idea, I'm way too hot!
