A comet wipes out most of life on Earth, leaving two Valley Girls to fight the evil types who survive. Robert Beltran (Star Trek Voyager), Catherine Mary Stewart (The Last Starfighter).

If you like movies like; 28 Days Later, Omega Man, The Last Man on Earth, etc., you may like this movie.

Get this one while you can...since this movie is no longer available on VHS and the rumor is the original print is lost or tied up in leagle ownership dispute, it won't be coming to DVD any time soon.

This is a full screen copy and the video and audio quality is pretty good for a DviX rip.

PS - If anyone has the wide screen copy could you please seed it :-)
