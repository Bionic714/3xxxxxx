I wonder..
Do you often go into your local videostore, and tell everybody that you dont like this video, or this video, and this, and that is shit...?

If you dont like this video - dont download it! Simple, huh?
Comments like ""Good up"", ""Thanks for sharing"" or even some whining about the quality - it might be out of sync or poor quality - can be ok.

""This movie stinks"" however, doesÂ´nt add much, does it?"
,Rustbuket,2008-02-14T08:43Z,"I love this movie! First saw it when it was a new movie, then taped it off of HBO or whatever channel. Widescreen would be great but this will do. "
