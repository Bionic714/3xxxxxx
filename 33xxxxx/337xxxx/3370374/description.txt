This patches are for: Apple.OS.X.x86.Developer.Kit.Install.DVD-deadmoo

There are 2 patches combined, that together bring:

        * Removes TPM chip check
        * Support for Generic ATA chipsets
        * Support for PS2 Mouse&Keyboard
        * Support for AC97 Codecs
        * Preliminary support for SSE2 (we still recomend a SSE3 enabled CPU)
        * All the extensions from Darwin
        * IOHDIXController.kext
        * DS.bundle

Requirements for the patch:

        * A linux box (ubuntu, fc4, etc.)
        * bash
        * gzip
        * root priviledges
        * hfsplus FS support
        * loopback module support
        * The original Marklar-Tiger.iso (md5: e78fe52e30a1f8c5b29d4b7932a16c5e)
        * patience...

For those who need SSE2, you should patch the bootloader not to check for SSE3.
You will have to do that manually:

        * Get a hexeditor
        * Find the location 0x7D64C0
        * Replace the value 53B801 with 33C0C3
        * Save the file

If you need the original CoreGraphics, with SSE3, put back the original CoreGraphics
using:
        ./sse3
