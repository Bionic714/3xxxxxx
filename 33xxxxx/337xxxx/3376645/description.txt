-------- LYRICS --------

WORLD OF WARCRAFT IS A FEELING

You look good in high-res
You've got uber chat skills
Won't you grind quests with me - endlessly
Tanking mobs is my role
I maintain aggro
But the rogue doesn't know, he's not MT (main tank) tonight

World of Warcraft is a feeling
Who needs a social life
I can't wait to log in,
Hop on a griffin

Stockades, gnomer, SM
Won't you join me, on an instance farming run
Let me hit the vendor, free up some bag space
Once I repair, I'll be good to go

World of Warcraft is a feeling
Who needs a social life
Stratholme, Scholo, and UBRS
He just dropped my valor helm
How could I roll a 6?
Grats to my guildmate, but I can't believe this shit

This is the best game
This is the best game I've ever played
This is the greatest game
World of Warcraft you're the greatest game
World of Warcraft you're the greatest game
The best game I've ever played
Woah
I can't wait to log on
Hop on griffin
World of Warcraft, a World of Warcraft
A reality.
