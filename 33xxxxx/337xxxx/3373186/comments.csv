Can anybody this, there are quite a few peers at 96% so it would be really appreciated by many. If anyone can seed discs 2 and 3 also, there are many at 70% for these also.

Happy Holidays!"

,Mighty_Marvel,2008-01-04T22:24Z,"It's all well and good asking someone to seed this. But as soon as people finish the download they just clear off and do not do any seeding. The Torrent world is full of selfish people.

This Torrent lists one seeder. Yet out of all the people who must of finished this Torrent, where are they and why are they not seeding?"
,Mighty_Marvel,2008-01-04T22:29Z,"I am seeding Series 3 Disk 4 and a number of people have finished downloading since I completed and began seeding and not one of them has seeded.

People just cannot be bothered to give anything back so why should the original uploader bother?"
