,gregorianus,2008-01-27T15:20Z,"I have a question. I have downloaded the MTW game without the expansion, mounted it with Daemon Tools, unzipped the no-CD fix, and it runs quite well. 
Now I am downloading VI too. What have I to do in order to install it properly? Must I uninstall the first MTW or what? Please, help:)"
