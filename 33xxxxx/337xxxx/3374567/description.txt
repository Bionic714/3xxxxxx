I am a very big fan of the physical sweating comedian Lee Evans. Every time I see one of his live shows I know it is going to have new mad, wild and ingeniously written and performed comedy from the excellent stand up. This "Different Planet" tour is probably my favourite of all the shows I have seen Lee Evans in. He starts off with a good microphone sequence and then he moves straight to his true story jokes with physical and hilarious bad language included. All his jokes have something about them that are both funny and true to real life, e.g. about women, shops, restaurants, planes, etc. Most memorable jokes are about planes and the "pay rise" sequence. Outstanding!
