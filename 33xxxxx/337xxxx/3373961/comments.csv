,Catematt,2006-03-21T08:21Z,There about 17 leechers hanging with 99.1% only lacking Smuggler's Blues of this great album. Someone please either reseed or continue? Thanks in advance.

Again?
Please?"
,SpaceSpider,2008-02-05T23:18Z,"SEED please, 99%"
,blumpkinator,2008-04-02T04:30Z,"It's only fucking fitting.  This guy was a douche, and his 80's output was fucking hilariously disgusting debaucherous dogshit.

I'm glad you're stuck at 99%, it's perfectly appropriate.  Look up Don Felder, at least that guy had a soul."
