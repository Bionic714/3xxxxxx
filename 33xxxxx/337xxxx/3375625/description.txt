Johnny Cash in San Quentin (1969), TRIO, TV

Originally planned as a follow-up to the wildly popular At Folsom Prison, Cash was set to create an eponymous album at the San Quentin prison. Cash ended up giving one of his rawest and wildest performances that seemed to feed off the literally captive audience and reflected the dramatic shift in the band following the death of guitarist Luther Perkins. The performance was short, only an hour, but is widely regarded as one of his best.

A unique concert given to the long term inmates of the famous jail. Johnny sings 'Wanted Man' (written especially for the concert by Bob Dylan) and 'San Quentin' (written by Cash just in time for the concert).
