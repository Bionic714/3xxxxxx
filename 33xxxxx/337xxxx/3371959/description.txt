Ok, here is the UNRATED version of the movie.  The commentary between both versions of the dvd is the same, except for a THIRD commentary on the "unrated" version.  The commentary is called: "Extreme commentary with extreme sports punk #1 Danny Bochart."  This commentary is available as a second track in the movie.  Just choose "audio track 2" for the "extreme" commentary.
