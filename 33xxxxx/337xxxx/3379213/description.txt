In Deathrow there are no rules and full-contact aggression is not only legal, it's required!  The fastest, toughest players are victorious and the slow and weak are defeated.  The game combines the lightning-fast gameplay of third-person action games with the cooperative team play and gritty roughness of rugby, offering a unique combat sport experience. 
 
The object of Deathrow is for you to win matches by whatever means necessary, either by scoring as many points as possible before time runs out, or by severely injuring your opponents and removing them from the field of combat.  As the game begins, two teams of four players square off in a combat arena to compete in an intense, unmediated slugfest to determine the champion.  As you engage in fierce hand-to-hand combat with highly intelligent AI opponents seeking retribution for not only themselves, but also for their fallen teammates, you'll soon understand the sacrifices necessary to become the supreme team of the league.
