Ghinzu is a band like none other. Powerful rock that will electrify and make you jump around as well as chilled songs, but that never become too conventionally boring (no boring 3:00 acoustic ballads!)

They make heavy usage of electric guitars, piano, keyboards. 

Oh, by the way, they're Belgian
