Detroit Techno Militia is a grass roots collective on a mission to promote Detroit Electronic Music around the world. Influenced heavily by Detroit's' techno history and spreading the gospel of techno to anyone who will listen. We believe in what we do, and take pride in giving back to something that has given so much to us. We look at it a lot like restoring an old building. While most people have the out with the old, in with the new attitude, we want to maintain the historic value that is already present in Detroit. We are not tearing down the old building, but using the existing structure as a basis of our endeavors. Musically, Detroit has a lot to offer, and we want to make sure the rest of the world knows about it.

The message runs deep, and it IS getting through. Much respect to all the Detroit artists who've made this possible."If we don't do something for the music we love, the music dies."
