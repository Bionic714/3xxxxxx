Victoria McPherson is a brilliant young FBI agent investigating a serial murder case. The body count has grown to five, and with the lack of real leads and a mountain of circumstantial evidence, Victoria is beginning to show signs of fatigue and stress.

She decides to take a break at her father?s home in suburban Chicago; after all, it is close to the Christmas holidays. However, Victoria does not find rest. Instead, she finds one of her grandfather?s old case files and begins to read. Oddly enough, Victoria?s present case resembles the one from the past, right down to the killer?s MO ?
