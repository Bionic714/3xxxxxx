The only problem: it doesn't write multiple tracks, only 1 track, containg the whole album. Anybody knows how to burn multiple tracks with CDRWIN? "

,SoundFanatic,2007-12-30T17:23Z,Still tramping at approx 99% for a loooong while now. Can anny one with 100% start seed.
,muse.mann,2008-02-20T19:20Z,"You can still produce the Telarc cd from the 99.9% .cdr image.  Use CDRWIN, select write CD?DVD image and drag the file into the box and burn.   Put a black cd into drive & close drive before you hit 'start'.   

How do I know this works ?   I succeeded in making one that plays on my dvd player via my DTS capable amplifier.   Cheers."

,SocialismSucksAss,2008-12-27T04:41Z,"I know many of you are having problems burning this type of image to disc. 
Here is a workaround:

1) Mount the Image in a Virtual CD/DVD Drive using Daemon Tools
http://www.daemon-tools.cc

2) Next start up nero burning rom, on the left scroll bar/window select ""CD Copy"" --> At the top you will see four tabs here is what to do with each one:
Image: Do nothing here

Copy Options: Make sure on the fly is checked  --> where it says source, select the virtual drive that holds the CD image the choose the appropriate read speed, I chose 8x but have a 32x and maximum option. 

Read Options: (this one matters most)- 
Profile Selection, chose ""Data CD""

Burn: Chose ""Disc-At-Once/96"" this allows for non-standard format audio cds like DTS or 

CD-Text to be written. Make sure the write tab is checked off, if your read speed is 8x choose a write speed of 4x.

3) Now, click the Copy Button at the bottom and wait 20 minutes or so. Make sure your screen savers and other IDLE tasks like F@H are disabled. 

4) Enjoy. "
,SocialismSucksAss,2008-12-27T04:44Z,"I forgot to mention in my last comment and must amend:

IN THE ""READ OPTIONS"" OF NERO, 

Under the section titled DATA TRACKS, 

BE VERY SURE TO Check off ""Read Sectors in RAW MODE and Read Subchannel Data should also be checked off"" If nero asks to go on the internet to check for track info, decline the offer.

This method worked well for me and I have all the available tracks. The disc plays fine in my DVD/SACD player. "
