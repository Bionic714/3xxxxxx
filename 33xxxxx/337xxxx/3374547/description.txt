X-NetStat displays information on your current Internet and network connections, much like the console netstat.exe program, but in a graphical interface. These connections are established each time you visit a web page, send an instant message, check your email, or anytime you do network activity that requires you to connect to another computer. They also appear when outside computers attempt to connect to your machine, authorized or not. Each connection is displayed in the Connection Table, where you can see the address you are connected to, what ports (local and remote) are being used, the connection status, how long the connection has been active, the program behind the connection, and how much bandwidth is being used. 

X-NetStat Professional contains powerful features like a Rules System that lets you set up actions based on network conditions, a comprehensive Network Statistics window displaying information on network interfaces and protocols, a Web Server that lets you access XNS information remotely, a collection of Lookup Tools (TraceRoute, WHOIS, Finger, DNS, Web Search, etc), and many more features. 

Fresh Software has been improving X-NetStat for the last 7 years based on user feedback. With a smart graphical user interface, a rich feature set, and innovative concepts, X-NetStat Professional is critical tool that administrators and power users should not be without.
