Born in 1978, Fisz writes original lyrics that are deeply intimate, poetical and full of introvert observations. In his work he has always been helped by his brother and producer in one person - Emade (born 1981) who not only works with samplers but lately also came back to play on drums/percussion, guitar and keyboard. Emade creates for Fisz a spacious and calm music but at the same time music that is powerful and 100 % authentical. This music has had its first inspiration in old-school hip hop (Native Tongues) and in contemporary Conscious Hip Hop. You can also hear both old and new soul and funk in this music. Recently they have both begun to experiment with avangard music (click/noise).
