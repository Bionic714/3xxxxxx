,jumper8,2007-06-16T19:36Z,"Hi man

I wondered if you could get another book database program called Bookcat.
I canÂ´t get collectorz to connetct to my lokal library and that sucks. But bookcat can, but in this case i cant get a cracked version."
,Vuxen,2007-12-19T23:14Z,Thanks a lot!
,DocEvil,2008-02-07T08:06Z,"Good cracked versions, but they're outdated. They don't even connect to the Collectorz.com database, which is really the best part of the newer versions.
They all work, but you just have to put up with older software."
,YonderAnt,2008-02-11T10:29Z,"damnit i can't find a latest version of game collector pro except this but like the above post said, it's too outdated/has less features."
,YonderAnt,2008-02-11T10:34Z,"never mind, found it, in case anyone looking for it too, it's in emule."
,FGR,2009-05-10T19:19Z,"i know there ir Collectorz.com for Mac...
