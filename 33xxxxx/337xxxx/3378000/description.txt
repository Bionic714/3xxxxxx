|  Public Enemy rewrote the rules of hip-hop, becoming the most influential  |
|  and controversial rap group of the late '80s and, for many, the           |
|  definitive rap group of all time. Building from Run-D.M.C.'s              |
|  street-oriented beats and Boogie Down Productions' proto-gangsta          |
|  rhyming, Public Enemy pioneered a variation of hardcore rap that was      |
|  musically and politically revolutionary. With his powerful,               |
|  authoritative baritone, lead rapper Chuck D rhymed about all kinds of     |
|  social problems, particularly those plaguing the black community, often   |
|  condoning revolutionary tactics and social activism. In the process, he   |
|  directed hip-hop toward an explicitly self-aware, pro-black               |
|  consciousness that became the culture's signature throughout the next     |
|  decade. Musically, Public Enemy were just as revolutionary, as their      |
|  production team, the Bomb Squad, created dense soundscapes that relied    |
|  on avant-garde cut-and-paste techniques, unrecognizable samples,          |
|  piercing sirens, relentless beats, and deep funk. It was chaotic and      |
|  invigorating music, made all the more intoxicating by Chuck D's forceful  |
|  vocals and the absurdist raps of his comic foil Flavor Flav. With his     |
|  comic sunglasses and an oversized clock hanging from his neck, Flav       |
|  became the group's visual focal point, but he never obscured the music.   |
|  While rap and rock critics embraced the group's late-'80s and early-'90s  |
|  records, Public Enemy frequently ran into controversy with their          |
|  militant stance and lyrics, especially after their 1988 album, It Takes   |
|  a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, made them into celebrities. After   |
|  all the controversy settled in the early '90s, once the group entered a   |
|  hiatus, it became clear that Public Enemy were the most influential and   |
|  radical band of their time.                                               |
|                                                                            |
