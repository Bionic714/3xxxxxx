Fraps is a universal Windows application that can be used with all games
using DirectX or OpenGL technology. In its current form Fraps performs
manytasks and can best be described as:
  
Benchmarking Software - See how many Frames Per Second (FPS) you are
getting in a corner of your screen. Perform custom benchmarks and
measurethe frame rate between any two points. Save the statistics out to
disk and use them for your own reviews and applications.
  
Screen Capture Software - Take a screenshot with the press of a key!
There's no need to paste into a paint program every time you want to
capture the screen. Your screen captures are also automatically named and
timestamped.
  
Realtime Video Capture Software - Have you ever wanted to record video
while playing your favourite game? Come join the Machinima revolution!
Throw away the VCR, forget about using a DV cam, game recording has never
been this easy! Fraps can capture audio and video up to 1152x864 at 60
frames per second!
