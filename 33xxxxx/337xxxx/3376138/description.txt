ORANGE AND LEMONS
Orange and Lemons MP3 Collection (Phils, 2005)


It's a trip to the 50's, 60's and the 70's with Orange and Lemon's music. Listening to them reminds me of those brit-indie bands. This group has instantly become one of my new favorites recently. They sing both english and tagalog songs, with lyrics that are well.. quite meaningful.

Their hard-to-find debut album is available only in Manila, on a few local stores, and online indie stores in the Philippines and Japan, and thru their gigs. 


GENRE:
Indie, Indie-pop, Rock, OPM


THE BAND:
Orange and Lemons (ONL) are Clem Castro (electric guitars/vocals) Mcoy Fundales (acoustic guitars/vocals), JM Del Mundo (bass) and Ace Del Mundo (drums). Though still an emerging new face in the Philippine music scene with their own fresh and distinct sound, Orange and Lemons was astoundingly named Best New Artist in the 2004 NU Rock Awards. Orange and Lemons' music is downright original and their songs have a lot of heart. Their fans are now hoping that they will inspire a new generation of guitar-toting youth to fourge a musical upheaval that would he­lp revive the Pinoy music scene. ONL is now under Universal Records. ~Padis Point
