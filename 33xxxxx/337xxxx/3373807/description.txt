The Gathering Storm (2002) (TV)

"Albert Finney offers an excellent presenttaion of Winston Churchill in the years immediately before World War II. Facing a rising Nazi germany, most of the British Parliament chooses to look the other way in hopes of peace. Parliament even votes to send Germany airplane engines. Against the wisdom of the other party members, Churchill preaches against the Nazi threat. But the aspect of the film that makes the story a standout is the personal relationship and love he had with his wife, Clementine (Vanessa Redgrave). Churchill's arrogance strains his family and personal relationships, including his wife."
