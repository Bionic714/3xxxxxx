,BaGGeW,2006-01-05T13:37Z,Det funkar inte att spela =(. !!!
,DVD7227,2006-01-07T18:11Z,"Game won't work, it installs and then when it prompts you to enter disc 1, a window pops up saying thats not disc 1. Can someone please help, someone who has this?"
,DVD7227,2006-01-09T08:20Z,"OK sorry for that comment on Madden 06 not working. It works 100%
Imma write a little guide on how to install and run the game. This game also contains the keys you'll need so you have everything in this torrent. Once you get all the files run Daemon tools and mount disc 1(Note- Alcohole will install the game, but I had problems so I used Daemon later and it worked.)
Then when thats done mount disc 2 and it will install and ask for disc 3.
Mount disc 3 and then your done, quit on the window it gave you.
Now once its done installing you will need to change something. The reason Im saying this because I had a loading problem and it stayed getting stuck on the loading screen .
So open My computer then click on C: drive
and then go to Program Files and then EA Sports after that open madden 06. 
Now look for Music folder and Rename it to Music1 and thats it. Hope I helped."
,viola,2006-01-09T18:21Z,"The game won't start!!! It asks for the correct cd all the time and I can't find a no cd crack. 
Where can I find a no cd crack
PLZ help me!"
,DVD7227,2006-01-11T02:04Z,"To- viola
    The Game does not need a no-cd crack. The Reason it keeps asking you to put in the correct cd is because Madden 06 does not function correctly with Alcohole. Instead mount Madden 06 with Daemon tools and the game will load. Also make sure you rename in the Madden directory Music to Music1, not doing so will freeze on the loading screen. If you still get problems uninstall the game and reinstall it using  Daemon tools. Hope this works, as it did for me."
,viola,2006-01-11T19:55Z,"to - DVD7227: Thank you for your answer. But the problem is that I got it burned onto 3 cd's from a freind and I can't mount the cd, can I? Because there aren't any cue files on the cd. So I have to install it the normal way, and it doesn't work when I try to load the game later.
Have any ideas???"
