,Quickstrike,2005-08-17T07:13Z,"Hmm, so has rewind been improved a lot?

Why exactly is it so slow and choppy rewinding movies anyway?"
,scream_h,2005-08-17T07:55Z,"Jag fick problem med filmer med AC3-ljud nu med denna releasen.
Den skickar vanlig sterosignal med ett himla oväsen till min reciever nu.
Någon mer som fick detta problem?"
,spyke,2005-08-17T12:40Z,"@Quickstrike: it's not really in the hands of the XBMC developers, unfortunately - the video playback is all handled by MPlayer in a separate dll. The XBMC devs are at the mercy of the MPlayer devs when it comes to bug fixes and updated releases.
I agree rewind needs improving, but it's quite processor-intensive with today's forward-play optimised codecs such as XViD."

,captainskittles,2005-08-17T18:47Z,hey gas driver im a great fan of your work but can you intergrate linksboks into your xbmc builds that would be great theres a whole tutorial on how to do it but here http://forums.xbox-scene.com/index.php?showtopic=396230&hl=xbmc but i cant compile it so please take a look
,GasGiver4711,2005-08-17T22:21Z,"captainskittles: Thanks for this interesting tip - I  took a look at the thread and it really looks promising  -  BUT  -  for now (as very clearly stated in the thread) i will respect the developers wish NOT to spread it to ""End Users"". They don´t want to have it out in public until it is stable enough, which i can b.t.w. perfectly understand. I will keep an eye on it, will try to test if i can get it to work at all, since integrating it can be a little difficult, but as i said it won´t get integrated into my builds for now. - Another reason is : This is HIGHLY experimental stuff at the moment and i absolutley don´t want to get my builds unstable. Remember  - We are always using the latest CVS code for xbmc here!  -  I´m satisfied with that and would not want to go back to one of the ""ancient"" ;-) Point Releases, but what we´re doing here is ßETA enough i think ;-)"
,gappi8,2005-08-17T23:10Z,"Yo GasGiver Do you  know how to enable the dvd menu in xbmc.. so watch a dvd with the menu's. Some people already have it

,GasGiver4711,2005-08-17T23:14Z,"gappi8: LOL, no sorry i know it should be in there but i couldnt find it either ;-)  -  but to be honest i didnt investigate further ... Tell me how  to get there if you find out ..."
