30 minutes of bonus London footage. Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson and Steve Watson experience the police state mentality first hand, being questioned by police and the locals telling us we need to give up liberty for freedom during their visit to research the 7/7 London bombings...

A bit over dramatised but has a good section with David Shayler..  And a small section with Annie Machon gettign out of a taxi.. (that made it more than worth downloading :) )

Enjoy
