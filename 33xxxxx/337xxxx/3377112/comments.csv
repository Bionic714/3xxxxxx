,Ryu_Bushi1,2009-08-20T01:56Z,"I just finished downloading this torrent and my Anti-Virus software found this Trojan Horse Generic6.HDC in the keygen.exe file.

Virus Scanner / Anti-Virus Software used McAfee VirusScan Enterprise 8.5
Note: I have it set to active scan so it detects a virus as it is being downloaded.

You might want to scan this file and re-up or re-seed because I really like this tool. 

I admire your hard work and will check it out again.

JUST PUT YOUR PARANOID VIRUSSCANNER ON HOLD IF IT BUGS YOU.
I HAVE NOD32 INSTALLED AND IT HAS NO PROBS WITH THE KEYGEN.

THANKS FOR SHARING!!!!!!!"
