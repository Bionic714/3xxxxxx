Yes this is the Director's cut of Ashton's famous movie. It is kind of sad. Compared to the THEATRICAL EDITION. Anyways download this and also the regular version. You will like both of them. Trust me!!

I have uploaded the THEATRICAL EDITION of this movie here on PIRATE BAY. It is a 700.22MB XviD single CD file in English and excellent quality. Hope someone can convert this Director's Cut DVD into an XviD or DivX single CD 700MB file and upload it.

PS: This is a rare copy of the movie. It is easy to find the Divx copy of the regular version but not of the Director's cut. I will greatly appreciate if someone who downloads this movie convert it into a compressed Divx or Xvid and upload it. The Director's Cut only.

ALSO THIS IS AN ISO FILE SO MAKE SURE YOU CAN EITHER VIRTUALLY MOUNT THE DVD USING A PROGRAM LIKE DAEMON TOOLS OR SIMPLE BURN THE DVD. I USE ROXIO EMC 7.
