,Trashcanman02,2006-03-25T06:41Z,"I tried single player HL2, works great! I love you!"
,Trashcanman02,2006-03-27T19:55Z,"Multiplayer is not going to work. Valve's anti-piracy people are genius.

The only way to get the updates is to register the game with Steam, and if you don't have updates, you cannot connect to updated servers.

Do not try to use any keygens or cd-keys to register. A lot of people have been caught.

I think we can connect to outdated servers, so make it obvious. I'll put the word ""outdated"" in my server name whenever I play multiplayer."

,-OLDBOY-,2006-07-31T19:05Z,"HL2 works like a clock, but as i expected, the online play with css and stuff dont work...
I just get a message saying that i dont have the same version as the server...

But i dont care, ive always hated cs, so i would probably hate css too...

But if you want to play the HL2 in SP, it works like a clock, i didnt even have to use a cd key!?
Installer is in German ( i think) but also in English, so dont worry. 

Good upload, great game!"
