,mig_unit,2007-01-23T18:16Z,"I'm kind of new to this whole downloading thing, so I'm sorry if the following question seems silly. When I go to download the file, Azureus asks me what the encoding is and gives me 9 options. What should I click on?"

,ketsueki,2007-04-29T15:19Z,read mein kampf hitler was very much into the occult i will try to upload a book about it but for example both the S in SS(represenitive of destroyer symbolic of Zues's lighting bolt) and the swastica (a sancrit symbol for victory)are occult symbols chosen by him because he believed heavily that it would ensure victory there are many other occult ties such as hitler used psychics on a regular basis and he had mengalese conduct expermints on one twin to see if the other would suffer from the effects also and at what distance this link had so you see hitler has a rich occult history oh and a bit of trivia for you hitler was a baptised catholic and never was excomunicated says something about catholics dont it.........ALL HAIL THE HORNED GOD
