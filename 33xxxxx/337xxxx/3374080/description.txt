A scan of the Starwars Cookbook II, full of nice recipes illustrated by pictures on starwars miniatures along with food. You will need the program cDisplay from http://www.geocities.com/davidayton/CDisplay in order to read this. But can also change the name from .cbr to .rar, unzip anywhere you like.
