,aitsu,2006-03-29T14:17Z,any seeders out there?  I'd really like to get this torrent : )
,patg4362,2006-04-28T23:53Z,"oh please oh please, someone please seed! I've been at 99% for a week, no peers."
,JEGboy,2006-12-13T05:17Z,"please seed..... have been trying to download, but no luck... thanks"
,poweet,2008-01-16T00:07Z,Please seed... I'm stuck at 99.99%
,Moghsina,2008-02-17T23:24Z,"If this is the same torrent I'm stuck on, then it's 99.9% complete. There's only 1 song which is not complete: 
Displacing The Priest\Nitin Sawhney -  Displacing The Priest.mp3 size:11.7 MB done:11.4 MB	complete: 97.8 %	pieces: 48	

So all songs except for that one work perfectly.		"
,Moghsina,2008-02-17T23:37Z,"edit: the error in the previously mentioned song occurs at 7:57, (song lasts 8:37)

So except for this glitch all seems fine."
,Moghsina,2008-02-17T23:46Z,edit again: Didn't listen to all albums as I have some allready (like beyond skin) It seems there's glitches in that one indeed. So basically all I can confirm is about the availability: that the missing 0.01% is in the song Displacing the priest. No comment about the quality of the torrent.

Thank you man, great music indeed."
