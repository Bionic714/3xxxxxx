,RoggleToggle,2007-04-10T02:35Z,"This album is truly superb.  A lost classic rock gem, any classic rock enthusiast will more than likely enjoy this. "
,RoggleToggle,2007-04-29T06:20Z,"I have one major beef with your review, sir.  The ""cheesy"" breakdown in the song ""Seduction"" I believe is supposed to represent purgatory, at least thats how I interpret it.  Also, I find the sound to be whimsically-demonic and fanciful, not ""upbeat"" and ""cheery.""  Although I'd concede that it is ANYTHING but black metal.  At any rate, great lp, check it out."
