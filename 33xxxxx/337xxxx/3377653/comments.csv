,cabin_boy,2006-10-26T23:00Z,Is this DVD widescreen and NTSC?
,fluffman86,2007-05-01T05:24Z,"hey!  this iso doesn't work!  You cost me two freaking corrupt DVD's that won't play on my dvd player or computer!

DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT!"
,Ryu-Kotsu,2008-07-03T03:34Z,"Uhm....fluffman86, thats your fault. lol. Here is what you should have done, Download Daemon Tools, and then mount the ISO. Burning it wasn't a good idea. If you want to burn something, at least mount the ISO first to see if it works, and btw here is a link to where you can get Daemon Tools... http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php"
,Ryu-Kotsu,2008-07-03T03:35Z,"I am torrenting this right now, if it works I will start seeding it and I will also let you all know if it is working."
,garfieldgurl,2009-09-12T08:43Z,"ProjectBlack, I downloaded this movie, used daemon tools and opened it with Powerdvd. However, there's nothing but a grey picture with a hand and a person with the title in pink. Is that it? Or should I wait longer than a minute for the movie to start? "
,LS7,2009-09-28T16:49Z,"This is a big advertisement for galaxy.net. After you sit through the long, low budget, low quality ad that you can't get out of if you want to see the movie, you'll get to see the worst quality rip I have ever run across. Don't d/l this. There are plenty of good rips out there and this is not one of them. Total Crap. (this ISO is offered in different torrents, lookout for it, it's always the same size)"
