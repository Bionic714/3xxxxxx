,katamail,2006-02-12T17:59Z,"They come to our country as refugees saying that their lives are in danger so OUR own GOVERNMENT give them a nice welcome pack of

1) A House

2) State Welfare

3) Job

4) Whatever They Want (otherwise it is RACIAL DISCRIMINATION)

We have our own worries and people to look after never mind taking on the worlds problems, they breed like bloody rabbits have more than their fair share of property and cars, they have taken over most of our major cities and call themselves the ETHNIC MINORITY i think we all know who is the real minority in this country dont we. It should all change starting with:

1) Deportation of ALL middle east people ( let them suffer in their own country rather than us in ours)

2) Any monies owed to them put into a holding account to pay for the war vets of the gulf war and to the ones who gave us our real freedom (ww2) vets

3) No return policies

4) Any money proved to have been earnt in this country taken away and used to aid our homeless or ill

5) Any funds to their countries/families STOPPED"
,appelbie,2006-04-06T14:25Z,Where can I find the outlines they speak about in the introduction?
,fictionclemens,2006-04-27T00:44Z,"katamail,

I have a better idea. Let's round 'em all up and put them in concentration camps with ""special"" showers.

Oh wait, some asshole already tried that aproach, and I think the WW2 vets you are talking about took issue with him.

Incidentally, we like you and me stole this country. Learn some history or shut the hell up."
,fictionclemens,2006-04-27T00:51Z,"Sorry, shoulda been:

""Incidentally, white folks like you and me stole this country. Learn some history or shut the hell up.""

i reckon i should learn to type or shut the hell up myself."
,katamail,2006-07-07T11:27Z,"I say deport all muslim's as we are at war with terrorism and 99.9% of the terrorist's are muslims, in the Second world war the U.S either deported or imprisoned all Japanese living in the country and they were'nt going around bombing skyscrapers or train stations."
,multikrus,2007-08-07T16:57Z,"I tell you what, you can do what ever you want to do them. collect  them, put gas on them burn them (by the way these methods are not unusual in your culture). mind your own business . do not go their own country with your army and kill them"
,bl00dcl0t,2008-01-08T19:45Z,"Keep talking shit, keep invading, keep murdering, keep stealing, keep raping, keep enslaving, keep up your hypocrisy and don't forget your shocked expression when they hit you back."
,rockstar11998,2008-03-12T16:16Z,"Why would we be shocked if they hit us back.  They already declared war on us from the beginning of Islam.  I expect nothing less than what they have been doing for centuries and what the Koran says to do - kill or enslave all Christians, Jews, and people that won't convert to Islam.  Islam is evil.  Katamail might not have the right approach but we do need to weed out the bad apples or Jihad will be everywhere soon.  It will take the whole world to stand up to Islamic plans of world domination.  Sure Satan has put the right idea in Muhammad's head that all should be one faith worshiping God (except he wants it to be accomplished by force), but this is the same plan he instituted in heaven and was kicked out for it.  God will never force anyone to join a religion.  He warns them to leave a chosen area - like the Jews moving into Canaan or he sends out missionaries and prophets to preach repentance.  The other ways are not God's ways.   History is what it is.  All of it serves the purposes of God.  There has to be opposition against that which is true so that we have to make a choice.  Islam is the great opposition to Judaism and Christianity."
,blitzzen,2008-06-25T04:03Z,"So Katamail...have you contacted the elected politicians who  agreed to this policy expressing your discontent? Your orderly email seems to indicate you could.
As for the rest of the people who left negative comments ..equating Islam to terrorism is ignorant ..in words you might understand it is is retarded.
Maybe you will all go fight them and die and in one wonderful darwinian moment we will all be rid of you."
,rockstar11998,2008-06-28T17:31Z,"blitzzen - I am compelled to make negative comments about Islam.  It is evil no matter how many believers it has.  If you've truly read the full history of Islam you'd know how perverse and evil Muhammad's ways were.  He was not a prophet of God but a prophet of Satan.  Muhammad is an Antichrist, so right there gives me cause for speaking outright about Islam.  If anyone wants to know the truth about Islam's history I suggest you go to the website entitled Prophet of Doom.  The author of the Book put all of the material onto a website and it is Good stuff that shows clearly how messed up Islam is. "
,Anarcho-Naiveness,2008-07-04T01:07Z,"Despite my unfaltering opposition to religion as whole, I feel it rather necessary as an Westerner today to objectively gather some understanding on Islam, especially in the face of an only bolstering, grotesque xenophobia that seems impassably entrenched in the minds of my fellow Americans. 

Quite honestly, trying to take into account my total knowledge on Islamic matter leaves me with a pretty bleak picture of how I, too, seem to have failed in gathering anything non-propagandist amongst my social current; swirling of ignorance and militancy as it may, I still would hope for an overall higher sense of enlightenment in our era. (Allow particular comments above to give testament to that.)"
,rockstar11998,2008-08-06T18:18Z,"Anarcho-Naiveness - aka Antichrist - aka Korihor - Let me shed some light on the Islamic issue for you.  If you want some non propagandized media I suggest you watch the video by Walter Veith entitled The Islamic Connection.  It links the Satanic influences you'll find in both the Catholic church and the Islamic religion.  I already knew Islam was Satanic before watching his series of videos but now I know more deeply how it all began and where both groups get their roots in the pagan worship if Isis, Horus and Seth. 
Just because you don't understand spiritual things it doesn't make them untrue.  There are tons and tons of evidences that prove the Bible and other Scriptures to be true.  What are you so blind to all of these evidences?  I'm sure you might accept truth if you could just find it through all of the confusion Satan has set up in front of you.  Seek and ye shall find, Knock and it shall be opened unto you.  I give you that same promise. Have a good day."
,extreemthought,2008-08-15T05:54Z,"How unfortunate, that with such  remarkable access to information for illucidation and illumination - so many still remain dedicated to sepratism. 2008, for some - still dark ages for the ignorant, narrow minded, frightened xenophobe. 
Study, all that you can, and as your mind opens - the God that you are a part of, that if exitsts at all - does so far beyond your wildest imaginations - smiles."
