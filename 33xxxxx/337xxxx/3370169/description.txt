The short lesbian drama "Watching you" is an Israeli school project film. With a minimal budget, director Stephanie Abramovich has captured an everyday drama breathing of realism. It has been several years now since I saw it but no matter its school film air, it moved me deeply but in a gentle way, and seems to be unforgettable to me. You may not fall for it the way I did, but it's a small file so please give it a try.

It has won the Best Lesbian Short Film award at the Philadelphia Lesbian Film Festival

Format: Decent quality DivX.avi, considering the low budget film stock. File is derived from the commercial dvd edition.
