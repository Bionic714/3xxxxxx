" In the summer of 2002, Blink-182 invited the little-known band Kut U Up to accompany them on The Pop Disaster Tour. Kut U Up is not known primarily for their music. They are however, worshipped for their innate ability to cause havoc, concern authorities, and leave destruction and laughter in their wake. Along with their instruments and several gallons of booze, Kut U Up packed a few cameras in their new van which resulted in this unfettered, s*#$-faced, start-to-finish hilarity mixed with real-life drama DVD. Includes live performance footage by Blink-182, Kut U Up, Green Day and Jimmy Eat World "
