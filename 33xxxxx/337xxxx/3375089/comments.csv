-------------------------------
General Broulard: Colonel Dax! You will apologize at once or I shall have you placed under arrest! 
 Colonel Dax: I apologize... for not being entirely honest with you. I apologize for not revealing my true feelings. I apologize, sir, for not telling you sooner that you're a degenerate, sadistic old man. And you can go to hell before I apologize to you now or ever again!
