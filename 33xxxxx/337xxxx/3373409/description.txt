#################Release Notes###################

All the episodes in this release were captured directly from MTV2, i.e. svideo from cable box to my Radeon 9800 aiw.
Episodes were captured to huffYUV then encoded with CCE. ALL of the Music Videos are on each ep, these were some of the best
parts of B&B. The retail DVDs don't contain Music Videos, that is why I didn't do DVD Rips. The episodes were then authored
with DVDLAB. The DVD Contains Motion menus and an introductory video, it's pretty nice.

Some of you might be wondering, where is Jump? Cow Tipping? 1900Beavis, The Final Judgement of Beavis, and Let's Clean it Up?
I did not have enough space on the DVD to fit these episodes, but I do have them. They will probably be included on the
Season 5 (2 DVD) set.

Despite the low bitrate, the quality looks about as good as Full bitrate DVD. This stuff is the best quality of
Beavis and Butthead with music videos out on the net. It is much better than all those old crappy rips.
