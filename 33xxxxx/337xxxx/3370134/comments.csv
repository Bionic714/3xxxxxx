[V],ragip,2006-01-14T21:59Z,"Game dont work, please insert correct cd"
,ivanhoe68,2006-01-24T01:50Z,Use Daemon tool then it will work 
,johan_o,2006-02-07T17:58Z,"horrible game, probably the most boring one I've ever played. Just dialog and no action. DON'T DOWNLOAD"
,StoleaGoat,2006-03-06T03:55Z,Its pretty damn big for a clicky game. Beware...
,kurdern,2006-03-09T19:16Z,dosnt work 
,HUman_Shield,2006-07-18T13:50Z,"How to get it work? I tryed with daemon tools, but when I start the application it comes black screen and my cursor turns into a key but it stops there. "
,nekohina,2007-05-03T05:59Z,I found the crack. Once you load the game using Daemon tools open the cd that your computer is reading and you will find a crack folder
,theraphosa20,2007-07-12T16:22Z,"it works but its nothing i recomend, so fucking boring, they just talk,talk,talk,talk for 2 hourers and the littel sex thy show, this game could be aloud for children if you think how littel sex here is, this is a fucked upp,bullshit game, dont download, this stinks "
,mr.t1981,2007-07-25T21:50Z,once you find the crack how do you play it
,blastfire17,2007-08-18T21:55Z,"again, BANN these BOOKS."
,blastfire17,2007-08-18T21:57Z,"^ No I wasen't stupid enough to download, I have 1 of these and many on DC, THEY SUCK and are a waste of everything!!! Anyone who enjoys this crap is either japaneese or retarded ;)"
,Largo-Sama,2007-08-31T17:18Z,"Maybe you should read into what you are downloading before you start flaming. This is a VISUAL NOVEL. It's centered around the story, not the sex. It is supposed to be like that"
,Wootman12345,2007-09-13T00:55Z,Hey someone seed this!! I'm getting like 100b/s speeds here ÂŹÂŹ
,robertoII,2008-02-15T04:00Z,"Something's wrong.

PLEEEEEAAAAASE!!!!!"

,Dawnshade,2008-12-29T00:52Z,"Some people just don't aprecciate a storyline and hope for nothing but sex pictures and movies... Then don't download it, I for one won't hesitate to see what the story is about."
[T],Hgames,2009-03-13T13:01Z,http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4715262/Come_See_Me_Tonight black screen is usually a issue with some codec you have installed on your system.
,Takashi_Yuza,2009-04-01T14:56Z,"Honestly, its a Bishoujo, what would you expect from a bishoujo game? unless you guys start looking up what you download then your just asking to be dissapointed when you find out its a ""novel type game"". i suggest you google the title or something."
,Shadowhand1,2010-06-21T00:56Z,"these games are awsome, if you say otherwise you are just mad because you cant get them to work XD "
,cinatas,2010-11-14T02:04Z,"Lol, people bitching at visual novels cause they're visual novels.  People who don't like them either are lonely elitists who only play Call of Duty and Halo or just can't read for more than 2 minutes without getting a splitting headache."
,MrQuackers,2010-12-31T08:44Z,"^

This guy has the right idea.

While I enjoy games of this genre and I find them very nice, I'll have to give this one a shot. Played the 2nd one and liked it. So hopefully this is good."
,-Kotaro-,2012-02-16T10:00Z,Why does everyone hate visual novels so much... *sniffle* I am hurt to read all these negative comments.
