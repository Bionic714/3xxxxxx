EYEQ3.3 BETA 11B.ISO

Speed Reading and More !


ok, when you have the file( EYEQ3.3 BETA 11B.ISO ), use winrar to unrar it 

to a folder.
in the folder is a text file ( serial.txt ) in which the serial number is 

clearly displayed.
next you click the ( setup.exe ) setup file, it asks for the serial number 

so be ready to copy/paste.
next ( if you try to use it now it will ask for the original CD ) so what i 

did was make an image file ( .mds/.mdf ) of the ISO as i had downloaded it, 

in Alcohol, then i mounted that image file in DaemonTools virtual drive.
next clik on desktop icon and the program opens and asks for a screen name 

and whether you are a child or adult, and then begins.
comes with a nifty screen saver too.
