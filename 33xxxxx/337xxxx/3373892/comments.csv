,Kenny(HUN),2006-04-24T15:07Z,"Everybody stay at 96.7%, please seed it. Thx. :)"
,someonewhois,2006-04-27T18:21Z,"I agree, I have been at 96.7 for days, are there any seeders on this?"
[V],room101bellboy,2008-08-31T16:16Z,"Thanks, mate. I might watch it tonight. 
Seeding now, but at a low speed as I have 60 uploads to look after. I'll try to reach 2:1 as this is a rare file --we're only 3 seeders at the moment."
,Tabbystar,2010-08-26T23:53Z,"Thank you so much for uploading this! I have been looking for this rare movie for years and finally I have found it. Providing download completes, I will seed this as long as it is needed."
,Tabbystar,2010-08-27T11:35Z,Update: Movie download fully completed. Quality is absolutely spot on (not even any pesky black bars!) and sound is good too. Thank you everybody for seeding this. I am now currently seeding myself.
,Saki33,2010-08-31T15:57Z,I remember that I LOVED this movie and only reminded of it just yesterday while reading Rip Torn's bio. This is the only file of this move that is currently seeded and since not a huge file I will seed it forever. Thank you all for continuing to seed it five years later and thanks to you it is downloading at a nice speed. This movie deserves an audience and it is up to us to continue it. And of course many thanks to Lazlow2000 for providing it.

Been looking for this for some time..:)"
,DaimonE,2011-10-07T04:59Z,I was glad to find such a good copy and it downloaded fast with only 3 seeders!  I will seed this now as well.  
,Steve4nLanguage,2012-05-09T03:34Z,"Great movie; thanks to the original uploader Lazlow2000. I seeded until 4.0 ratio, and I hope others will continue to seed to allow further access to this fine film."
