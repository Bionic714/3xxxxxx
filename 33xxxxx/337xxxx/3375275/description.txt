    SKINS INCLUDED:

    Original Project Mayhem III skin from CVS only.
    It guarantees everything works perfectly and keeps Releases Small & Clean.
    This skin is constantly changed and updated. I you want to use other skins,
    make sure they are updated for this particular CVS Version of XBMC.
    Don´t ask me about problems with 3rd Party Skins - You´re on your own here !

    The only thing that´s changed is the look of the Webserver Interface.
    I replaced the Original with the Project Mayhem III Style Webserver Interface
    from KanadaKid (Scott). Looks very nice ´coz it perfectly fits the PM3 style.
    This also adds some small, but cool Functions to the Webserver Interface.

    SCRIPTS INCLUDED:

    FlexiBrowser / GameSaves / GameSpotPlus / GameTrailers / iFilmBrowser
    StupidVideos / QuickTimeBrowser (Movie Trailers) / simpleKML V2 (WebRadio)
    XBMCLyrics

    All Scripts suit the Project Mayhem III style.

    I modified the SkinProject Mayhem IIIPALDialogSubMenu.xml so that all
    of the Scripts appear in the Scripts Submenu. If you don´t like this, or
    some of the Scripts, you should edit this file to your personal preferences.
    The original file from CVS is also still present as DialogSubMenu.xml.ORG.

    CHANGELOG:

    To keep this .nfo shorter, I only list the topmost 3 lines here, so you can
    see what´s included here. You can view the official XBMC Changelog at  
    http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/xbmc/XBMC/Changelog.txt?view=markup
    You can also find it in docsChangelog.txt

    26-08-2005 added: httpapi exposed more values to GetGuiStatus
    26-08-2005 fixed: dvdplayer wouldn't play fightclub r1. now sets region mask
                      to what disc reports it's from if available
    26-08-2005 chaged: httpapi to be more thread safe

    TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS:

    If you are experiencing all kinda weird problems using an updated version
    of XBMC it is always a good idea to delete the XBMC´s "SaveGame"
    using the Micro$oft Dashboard.
    Alternatively, just delete the E:TDATA face008 and E:UDATA face008 dirs.
    This is especially important if you are updating from quite an old version.

    To avoid problems you should also check - with every new release - 
    if the included XboxMediaCenter.xml has been changed significantly.
    You should then update your own customized XboxMediaCenter.xml accordingly.

    If using XBMC as Dashboard, don´t forget to update the files on DRIVE ´C´.


    IMPORTANT UNPACKING INFORMATION:

    If (after unpacking) you think this Release is missing files READ THIS !
    This is a Multi-Volume RAR Archive [Compressed with WinRAR 3.50]
    To unpack it you need to have all files in the same folder and start
    extraction from the first volume. Please use an UP-TO-DATE WinRAR or any
    other Program that correctly handles Multi-Volume RAR Archives.
