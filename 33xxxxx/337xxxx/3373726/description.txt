'In his most ludicrously ambitious project yet, world-famous media hooligan John Safran scours the world in search of God... AND FINDS HIM.... Or, at least, a lot of folk who believe they have.'


This is an Australian comedy show from 2004, with religion as topic. Interesting, intelligent and hilarious, hosted by the very funny John Safran.
