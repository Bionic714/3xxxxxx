Combines video + several audiotracks + subs into one single file. really nice.
vlc player (www.videolan.org) will play it"

Thought OGM is so... gay. No reason to use it, the compression is like, under 3%, and it takes more hardware to play and encode it. Use MP4 if you want to be alternative."

,syzygy,2007-01-07T03:45Z,"God.  This series is rediculous! He starts doing a great job of focusing on the most trivial of religious dogma in every religion, then screws up what little information he does provide when he is ""exorcised"" in the last episode.  After watching it all I can honestl say that this whole series is nothing more than a testament to the power of hypnosis (and by that I mean subconscous suggestion)  and the willingness of the religious to use this talent to influence the gullible and intuitive.  Absolute trite! This series had a great premise, but sadly religious information is never clinical.  How dissapointing."

Boy, was I surprised.

The show is funny and is supposed to be a comedy show but I got a feeling after watching the last episode that the whole thing is some kind of Christian propaganda.
He starts of ridiculing a bunch of religions and somehow in the the end he mysteriously finds Christ through a bullshit exorcism.

Comedy show my ass."
