OK...I'm testing the water with this.If it is popular i will upload the rest (first 3 series out on DVD).

This is the famous 70's Britsh sci-fi with an enormous cult following.

Too big to upload as DVDs...These are ripped using DVD decrypter,individual episodes joined with vobmerge,then converted to VCD using mainconcept.

Any engine search for Blake's 7 will provide you with enormous amounts of information if you are uncertain what to expect!!!
