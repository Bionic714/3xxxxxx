This 2003 remake of the classic sci-fi television show recounts the saga of a destroyed civilization's last survivors, who band together in an intergalactic caravan with one purpose in mind: to reach their distant cousins on a faraway planet called Earth. The four-hour miniseries stars Edward James Olmos (as Cmdr. William Adama), Mary McDonnell, James Callis, Jamie Bamber, Katee Sackhoff and Tricia Helfer (as a malevolent Cylon infiltrator).
