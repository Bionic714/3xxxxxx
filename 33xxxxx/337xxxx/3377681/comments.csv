,w00tsuitriot,2006-05-28T21:26Z,"Can anyone seed this, pretty pleeze?"
,IncubusAZ,2006-12-20T06:48Z,"Can somebody kindly tell me how to play this DVDrip? I can get the .vob file to play but it will only play a Macrovision warning repeatedly. Do I mount this with MagicISO, Nero Image, Daemon Tools or some other program to play? Is there an online guide somewhere to learn how to play these types of DVDrips? 
Thank you very much."
,neomoxie,2007-01-26T09:18Z,"Are you using VLC Media Player? If not, Google it and download it."
,StraussWylde,2008-10-31T23:31Z,"I'm downloading at a whopping 0.5kb/s average. 
Groovy.

Seeding at 20kbps though, because my up is only 256Mbps.

It's something like 99.85% and taking forever. Hopefully by early next year I'll be able to look at it."
