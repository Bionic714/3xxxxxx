Broken VBR headers
No tags or completely wrong tags
Folder/filenames are a fucking disgrace

Zero quality in this torrent. Avoid it like a plague."

Don't know if troll, or just stupid. The song quality is fine. Everything sounds nice and clean and the folder/filenames are the way they're meant to be. This torrent has quality and quantity. Your comment is pointless and stupid.



Scanned with avast and came up with no viruses. Great amount of content! Was looking for something like this, thanks for upload. +1"

,sanitysama,2012-01-15T05:55Z,"@faggot
i wouldn't have bothered saying anything if it wasn't true, the quality is shit, the organization is terrible, and you're a fucking faggot. go back to reddit loser."
,fagg0t,2012-08-29T07:17Z,"AWESOME TORRENT!!! Only one complaint which is the lack of track #13 on the nonstop mix, I noticed @seedzplox said they don't have either.

@sanitysama needs to quit bein a troll or an idiot, whatever his issue is cuz this torrent is great."
