This is a very rare little flick.  Don't get on my ass about the sound being out of sync...you can read about the dvd here:

If you read on, you'll see that:

"The German dialogue is always prominent in the soundtrack and is rarely dominated by the score. The dialogue was entirely re-recorded in post production, and rarely matches the lips of the actors. I've heard speculation that many films from this era were recorded with no use of location audio whatsoever, which explains the terrible sync issues found here."

So it's not me! Ok? ;)  Unless you speak German, it shouldn't bother you anyway.

This movie has tremendous camp value...have fun!  Just be lucky that you can see such a good bad movie.

another stupid motherfucker telling me that my movies are out of sync
because they are totally computer illiterate.
