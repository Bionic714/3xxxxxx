I've included every song the PSX game Tekken 3 in this album. You can't find these by merely putting the game disk into a CD Player, so I had to use various hack and decode techniques to rip em.  I've put some hard work into naming each song, so please try to help seed this baby.  If you enjoy "The Crystal Method" or your into nice instrumental music, then this album is a must for your collection!

I'm uploading a second time for the folks who missed it, Enjoy!
Let me know of any corrections.  "Extra" tracks are ones I couldn't figure out. There may be 3-4 named tracks that are incorrect also. Overall, every song is here though.
