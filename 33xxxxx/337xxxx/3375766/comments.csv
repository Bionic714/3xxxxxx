Yeah, haven't been in here since Sept 2007 and was amazed it still runs :-)

To those in doubt, do indeed enter both the name and serial below, and it'll work for you...
I've used it for years and 's been a pleasant trip

,zwimaster,2009-06-23T11:04Z,"i downloaded (perfectly) in a few secs, but when i installed it told me that i had the wrong version of windows (!?) i have windows vista (no idĂŠa wich version) but i ignored the problem and the program dident work at all, am i the only one? maybe its just for XP users.... anyways XP is better ^^ "
,olav66,2009-07-24T11:01Z,"zwimaster,

This was uploaded long before Vista was a release! In 2005. Been dl'ed more than 200.000 times :-)

Now, I have no idea if it should work with Vista; since you asked, I am using XP SP2 (yes, still) and have no intention of using Vista..."
