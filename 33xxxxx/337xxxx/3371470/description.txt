US President George W. Bush discussed Iraq, the November elections and the war on terrorism in an interview broadcast Sunday feb. 8th 2004, but stonewalled a question about his university secret society.

"It's so secret, we can't talk about it," he told NBC television when asked about the fact that both he and the Democratic frontrunner, Senator John Kerry, are members of Yale University's Skull and Bones.

Though they graduated just two years apart and the society reportedly only inducts 15 new "Bonesmen" a year, Bush curtly denied knowing his rival during their time in college.

Bush's father, former president George Bush, and his grandfather, Prescott Bush, were also members, sworn to secrecy about the goings-on in their mausoleum-like headquarters on the school's urban campus.

Other members reportedly include another previous president, William Howard Taft; Vietnam war-era White House adviser McGeorge Bundy; and financier and diplomat W. Averell Harriman
