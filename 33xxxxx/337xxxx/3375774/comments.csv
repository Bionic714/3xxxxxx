A promising Torrent, but I am stuck at 73%.  Please seed.  

A Joey DeFrancesco fan."
,gisk,2006-10-19T10:53Z,"Although this is almost certainly not the place to ask questions, I am tempted to ask one that is pertinent to this page:

At this moment I am downloading this torrent at a reasonable rate.  This web page is informing me that there is 1 Seeder and 4 Leechers.  Since I have not placed any restrictions on the number of uploading users or the their upload rate, I have been considering myself a Seeder.  However, I cannot be the 1 Seeder because where then would I be downloading from.  Am I a Leecher and how can I stop being one?  Otherwise, what does the Seeder/Leechers data in the web page mean?  Where can I find information such as this?"
,danjelsplit,2006-12-17T17:03Z,Man you are the only one who upd Joey. I listen to him LIVE. He is one of the greatest Hammond players. Hope seeders will show up / only 1 now.
