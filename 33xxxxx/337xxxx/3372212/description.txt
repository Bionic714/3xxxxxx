Del Amitri, ( www.delamitri.com )was one of the absolute best unknown bands ever around.  

Justin Currie is a true musical genius. Waking hours is their second album. 
It came out in 1989 and is a good place to start from when exploring their music.
Track Listing:

01 - Kiss This Thing Goodbye
02 - Opposite View
03 - Move Away Jimmy Blue
04 - Stone Cold Sober
05 - You're Gone
06 - When I Want You
07 - This Side of the Morning
08 - Empty
09 - Hatful of Rain
10 - Nothing Ever Happens

If I see an interest I will put up more of their music.
Please, if you like them buy their albums. 
Justin Currie is worth supporting as he is currently working on his first solo album.
