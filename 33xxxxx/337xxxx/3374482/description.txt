plot:
When she consults her runes Livia, a beautiful but insane young woman, is promised the best day of her life. The day starts well enough when a homicidal psychopath, Emil, escapes from an asylum and takes refuge in Livia?s sprawling country house. But then Livia?s scheming family, headed by the patriarchal Harald, decide to kill Livia for the vast fortune she has inherited from her mother. One by one, Livia?s family members infiltrate her country house, intent on murder. One by one, they end up dead, despatched by Livia, Emil or Fate.
