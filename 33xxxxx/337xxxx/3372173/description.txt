The history and impact of the new global economy are made clear--and compelling--in Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy. This three-part, six-hour documentary does an astonishingly thorough job of dissecting and explaining macroeconomics and their current political and social importance without ever causing a loss of consciousness for the viewer. 

Part 1, The Battle of Ideas, chronicles the history of economic thought from the start of the 20th century and its socialist reforms right through the deregulation of the 1980s. 

Part 2, The Agony of Reform, explores the upheavals that such deregulation caused, focusing primarily on economic growth and gains and touching briefly on the wrenching consequences for the poor. 

Part 3, The New Rules of the Game, explores the consequences of globalization, including terrorism and the contagion of market collapse. 

The series makes good use of both large-and small-scale examples, and features interviews with several major world leaders. Big ideas are made extremely accessible to the average viewer (without condescension). Well worth watching.
