Watch how the world banks are taking over entire countries in name of Aid.

They talk about every bullshit available but dont utter a word of public properties taken over ni name of privatization. They do talk about it but are scared to tell us the truths."

,LangerX,2010-03-25T12:15Z,Very interesting to watch. From Keynes to Hayek economic philosophy. Unfortunately the documentary does not cover the last bank crisis which should be the turning point to neocons theory. Nevertheless great doc to make you think for you own.
