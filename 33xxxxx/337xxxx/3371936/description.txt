MSNWat is a tool designed to help you search for and play/enqueue MP3:s, OGG:s, WAV:s - songs that you have on your harddrive. It can also show you the current song name in your nickname on MSN using MSNWat:s own formatting with variables such as %title %album %genre and much much more. MSNWat uses an advanced system to update your musiclibrary so updates are very fast. The program also includes an advanced 'spelling correction' method. Wich allows you to mistype the name of the song and it will still find the correct musicfile. SongTable is a 'slide-down-window' wich contains lists of the album wich the currently playing song comes from, it also contains bookmarks from Winamp, top 69 songs and the last played songs. All in all, MSNWat is a useful tool for searching, selecting, and handling your music. All operations are done through hotkeys, ALT+1, ALT+2, ALT+3 and so on. Requires Winamp 2.91 or more recent and MSN 7.0 or more recent. The new version has improved and now supports SKINS!
