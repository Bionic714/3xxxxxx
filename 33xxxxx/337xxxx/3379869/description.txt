Exactly this is the THEATRICAL EDITION of the movie.  This the XviD format of the movie in English and is great quality. I have also uploaded the DIRECTOR'S CUT here on pirate bay. You might wanna download both of them.

P.S: The DIRECTOR'S CUT is an NTSC DVD. If anyone downloads it and is able to convert it to an XviD or Divx format and upload it, I will greatly appreciate it. Also if it would be great if the movie is compressed enough to fit in a single CD, without losing quality just like this one. This video is just 700.22MB

Enjoy!!
