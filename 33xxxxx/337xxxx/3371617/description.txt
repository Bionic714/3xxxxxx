Editorial Review
Amazon.com
The cleverness of Fall Out BoyÂ¹s lyrical content is immediately evident by looking at the song titles on their sophomore disc, "From Under The Cork Tree". "A Little Less Sixteen Candles, A Little More Touch Me", "I Slept With Someone In Fall Out Boy And All I Got Was This Stupid Song Written About Me" and "Sophomore Slump Or Comeback Of The Year" are but a small taste of the group's acerbic attitude. After FOB's indie debut hit the underground charts, the group's sudden indie-style success made for a fast growth spurt. Their appeal is obvious, from frontman Patrick Stump's Killer-esque pipes (especially evidenced in the disc-closer, "XO") to their very melodic teen angst-anthems. While much of the disc operates at usual punk-pop speed, the highlight comes from a slower, emotion-laden cut called "I've Got A Dark Alley And A Bad Idea That Says You Should Shut Your Mouth." This song of living in the public while working through private pain is a beautiful, multi-layered number that stays with long after the album is over. --Denise Sheppard
