,Krieschen,2008-03-05T21:32Z,"This DTS CD works for me like a charm.
Be shure to follow the instructions to burn this file and use a capaple DTS/player (or play on a home cinemaset with 5.1 capabilities)."
,aliasdavidoff,2008-04-13T16:02Z,"""Be shure to follow the instructions to burn this file"". There ARE NO instructions. CDRWIN is the most stupid GUI I have ever seen. Please give me a clue...how do I burn it? Anyone?"
,aliasdavidoff,2008-04-13T16:34Z,"OK, I figured it out after only a few hours! Here's how to do it:
1. Open CDRWIN and click ""Record disk"" (the upper left icon with a disk, a star and some kind of rainbow-line).
2. Click ""Load tracks..."" (ok, it's not tracks that you are supposed to load but an image, but this is the way to do it, believe me)
3. Click ""Add"". Chose the image by first chosing ""All format"" in ""File format"", otherwise you won't see your image...really smart....
4. Well, add your image and ""OK"".
5. CDRWIN compiles the image and tell you that ""1"" tracks has been added.
6. Click ""Record disk"" and the burning starts...

It's SO simple with CDRWINs brilliant GUI...why didn't I found out earlier...
