The famous British 70s sci-fi with a huge cult following.

OK...I have given up trying to re-encode series 3.Instead i have shrunk the 7.5GB dvd's using dvd shrink.

These are full working dvds with all the features.The first 4 dvds each contain 3 episodes and the 5th dvd contains 1 episode and extra features

This DVD contains episodes 36: Ultraworld, 37: Moloch, 38: Deathwatch

Be patient as i am seeding two torrents at a time on super-seed.I will upload each dvd every few days.

Please seed when finished to enable me to upload asap.
