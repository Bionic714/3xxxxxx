It does say there is a seeder and no leechers but I very much doubt those figures are correct. If you were super seeding then the client would not show a seed but no one has downloaded anything in days so there can be no seeds."
,Mighty_Marvel,2008-01-04T22:35Z,"I have completed now and I am seeding. But I have seen a number of people complete and yet not one of them has seeded anything back. I should list their IP addresses so anyone who seeds other torrents can blacklist them/add them to the ipfilter list. There is no place in Torrents for selfish people, Torrents are about sharing."
