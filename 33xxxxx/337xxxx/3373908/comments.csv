how do I put a iso file to dvd????"
,evilmidget,2006-07-12T18:38Z,"Three ways:
- Burn with Nero which recognises .iso files
- Extract files with WinRar or UltraISO and burn/watch
- Mount .iso file in a virtual drive such as Alcohol or Daemon

All of the above mentioned programmes should be available on TPB"
