,Geezguy,2006-11-07T16:06Z,"Hey, I found a soultion for those who gets stuck on the ship! Download the save file from Worldofmi.com/savefiles. It's the one marked ""After the pirate song"" or something. That file will load the game directly after the song, so you can contine the adventure from there!!"
,Geezguy,2006-11-07T16:10Z,"Sorry about the wrong link :P The correct one is:

http://www.worldofmi.com/features/download/savegame/

Enjoy :=)"
,Geezguy,2006-11-12T17:10Z,"You will also get stuck after you have used to crowbar on the wall in the bedroom because the after the scene that's supposed to start after that doesn't start, so you must download all the save files from World of Monkey Island, the link is above. They are under the save file ""after the pirate song""."
