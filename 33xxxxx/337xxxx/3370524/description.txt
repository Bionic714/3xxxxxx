A lot of people call this flower-power. I dont fully agree, but theres enough lazy westcoast-vibes here to make me happy anyway. ^_^ Hey, these guys did write "Aquarius/Let the sunshine in" after all. This is very well produced 1968 soul-pop with a tinge of flower-power.


Matthew Greenwald, All Music Guide:
One of the 5th Dimension's finest all-around albums, Stoned Soul Picnic is not only home to the title tracks, but also to the hits "Sweet Blindness" and "California Soul." All three of these songs provide excellent examples of the band's sunny and buoyant appeal. Although the singers' awesome vocal gifts deserve all the credit they get, it's also important to realize the immense contributions from producer Bones Howe and vocal arranger Bob Alcivar. The group was far more than a black version of the Mamas & the Papas. There are also some excellent album cuts here, such as Jeff Companor's "It'll Never Be the Same Again," where Ron Townson's exquisite soul pipes get off an amazing solo around an excellent Motown-driven arrangement. If you're going to pick up one 5th Dimension album (aside from a greatest hits package), you'd be hard-pressed to find a better one than this.
