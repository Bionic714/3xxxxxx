,moxlam,2006-01-28T00:28Z,"Please reseed, anyone. Been looking for this game for a long time. I have it in russian, italian and chinese, but really want an english version."
,moxlam,2006-01-29T04:04Z,"thanks! it worked, and it is in english. Havent tried the cd2 yet, since i had that one allready, but the install worked perfectly. Buggeles: the install CD works if you just burn a CD with the files you extract from the archive. I guess the play CD is the same....

Thanks again!!!"

,tuhkur,2008-08-05T08:56Z,"Okay, me again :D

 i got it working.

 it doesn't work on windows XP, i think not on vista also, then. I had to go  C:\Program Files\Might and Magic VI. Then, I watched MM6.exe properties. There I took compatibility, then iI checked the box Run This Program in compatibility mode for. I then choosed windows 98/ME, because on NT or 2000, it still didn't work. and then, enjoyed the game!"
,Rorreswe,2008-10-06T18:49Z,"Hey, I'm a proper noob, and I need help :p

I have installed the game and all that, but it says I need to insert CD 2? I can't mount anything because I dont know which file to mount, and I cant mount and of the files which came with the torrent.

Please! Someone write a slow and explaining guide! If I get help, I will seed this for a very long time. English or Swedish, it dosnt matter. 

Cheers :)"
,RyuRanX,2008-10-23T16:50Z,"Just download CD 1. CD 2 in this torrent doesn't have soundrack!!!!

,raidar,2008-12-15T17:53Z,"Please help me! I have downloaded the install CD (I already have the Playdisk) and I cannot make it work. The ""first screen"" comes on when I try to run it, but when I click on ""install"", nothing happens. It is as if it tries to open it without succeeding. I have tried burning it to a CD and changing the compability. I have also tried two different torrents here on TPB with install-CD's for this game. It's the same thing no matter what.

Help me!"
,jabavaan,2009-11-06T00:33Z,pls someone help me i can install this game but when i try play it ask disc 2 do i need crack or how i can get it work

,Haawkings,2010-07-02T21:27Z,"shit shit shit..

 (3.3) C:\games\mm6\mss32.dll: Pager initialisation error 2 - The system cannot find the file specified.

anyone know whats the solution to this ?"
,sotegihe,2010-10-06T17:35Z,"Ok, this is definately the worst game I have downloaded.

The information given, is CRAP. How am I supposed to know what I should do? Since when do you actually need to burn it down to a CD? wtf? u simply either mount .iso files and such, OR you just simply click the SETUP file. in this case, I click the setup, and nothing hapends. This is crap, and I really wanted this game. "
,MrMacntosh,2010-11-22T19:05Z,"I uploaded a new one for anyone who wants it. I put in a tool pack, both ISOs and some instructions on the torrent.

,fadedroots,2011-06-14T05:51Z,"anyone who wants to play this without a CD, do this:

1. Save this link as: http://home.mchsi.com/~andy4590/mm6.ini

2. Put the mm6.ini file in with your main might and magic folder (with the mm6.exe)

3. Play with no CD or burning or mounting!"
,Zodinpuia,2012-03-26T15:05Z,"I have a windows 7 os, created all the files I unpacked into an image file- I mounted the files using daemon tools (even tried power iso), I've followed the instruction given..but for some reason still can't install the game...I;ve also changed the compatibility to windows 98> 
I use to play this game when i was in the 7th grade and loved it..would really like to play it again and would really appreciate if you could help me out with the installation"
,Desaeon,2012-05-20T13:23Z,"Thumbs Up. Great torrent that brought back great memories.
here are the steps for those of you who couldn't play (takes u like 10 min max):

1- Download Imgburn from http://www.imgburn.com/

2- Extract the files from the torrent each in a separate folder. (there are 2 .exe files that represent CD1 and CD2)

3- using ImgBurn choose the option to write files/folder to CD image and create 2 Iso images from the extracted folders.

4- Mount the 2 Iso files you have just created using daemon tools or any other similar program.

5- Enjoy :D"
,begal.segoro,2012-09-06T11:56Z,"Works well, you can skip downloading the _anims.exe, since you can do full install with _setup.exe. Just use Grayface patch from Celestial Heaven forum (google it) and you can play on the newest computer no problem (I use core i3 with win7 64-bit) and without CD."
