This dreamlike fairytale captures the coming-of-age of a young Czechoslovakian girl. After receiving a pair of earrings, strange things begin to happen to Valerie. As her burgeoning sexuality sparks even more haunting escapades, Valerie must contend with an explosively surreal world that challenges and inspires her. Jaromil Jires' film is a surprisingly sensitive and visually spectacular.

Extremely beautyful, surrealistic...and very very strange!
