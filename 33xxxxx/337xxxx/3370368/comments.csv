We got a perfect orginal release here from before, we don`t need this unrared things.. It`s good that users more often upload org rls..Rared files/org releases helps us spreading..
Thats why, download the orginal rls!

,KptnBlåskägg,2005-08-15T23:27Z,"readysh: Oh, yes they would. There were some reasons to use rar a long time ago, when all file transfer protocols were stupid. Not that it was a good decision then, but at least there were reasons. Those reasons are not valid today, but using rar has become a way to try to express that you are leet and a reason to look down on the modern people around you, just like other forms of conservatism. It's a quite effective way to pretend you belong to a group; set up a number of completely pointless and silly rules, obey them blindly and call anyone breaking any of the rules a heretic, immoral, sinner, ""n00b"" (which is actually quite funny, since it is often the newbies that are arguing for .rar, while experienced computer users realize that it's useless), whatever. It is an effective and very common way to hold a religion or some other moralistic organization together, but it's not a good way to distribute releases.

,KptnBlåskägg,2005-08-16T00:10Z,"Thisisnotme: It looks like you just proved my point - you want to feel like an insider so you argue for .rar and claim that anyone not doing the same is an outsider, but you fail to even read the previous comments on this page, and you fail to come up with a single concrete argument."
,Thisisnotme,2005-08-16T00:25Z,"Sorry, but I'm not really an insider. I'm not in the scene, but I've gained some understanding for why the scene works like it does. I'm not trying to trash you or other people who might not possess the same understanding. I'm just saying that there are other reasons to why a release should be kept untouched.


""[...] you fail to even read the previous comments on this page""

This is the second time you've rushed to post your belief without knowing much about the subject. I did read the other comments. You should try to read a bit more about how the scene works if you are more interested in statements based on knowledge and facts instead of premature guesses based on negligible facts concerning a small part about a subject."
,KptnBlåskägg,2005-08-16T00:41Z,"Thisisnotme: You are still trying to pose as an insider, it's just
that your insiderism is ""understanding the scene"". What is really
disturbing about your comment is that you just assume that I don't
know anything about the scene. I'm guessing that you assume that
because I don't agree with you on the .rar issue, that as soon as you
learn the secret rituals of the scene, there is no doubt about whether
rar should be used? If not, why are you making that assumption? 
Regarding you reading the comments, it was obvious that you didn't
understand the previous comments or you wouldn't have said what you
said, and without understanding them it's hard to call it reading. 
Anyway, if you really know enough about the scene to understand why
rar is inevitable, I find it rather strange that you are unable to
come up with any arguments for it beyond the assumption that anyone
not agreeing with you do ""not possess the same understanding""."

Spot-on.

""Regarding you reading the comments, it was obvious that you didn't understand the previous comments or you wouldn't have said what you said, and without understanding them it's hard to call it reading.""

I did read it and understood what you tried to convey, but as I said earlier, I don't think your views are rightful. They indicate that a half-informed guy is trying to prevail ""know-how"" upon other people without even knowing much about the subject.

""Anyway, if you really know enough about the scene to understand why rar is inevitable, I find it rather strange that you are unable to come up with any arguments for it beyond the assumption that anyone not agreeing with you do ""not possess the same understanding"".""

As I said, I don't think too information about the scene should be on public sites. Especially sites like this one, but if you google enough, you'll be able to obain quite a lot of understanding, but don't believe everything you come over. Some might be misinformed people who rush statements (as I think you guys are doing:)"
,KptnBlåskägg,2005-08-16T01:10Z,"Thisisnotme: Ah, so you have had friends who didn't know what .rar
files was who didn't like .rar files, and therefore everyone who
doesn't like .rar files must not know what .rar is? Has it ever
occured to you that someone who knows both what .rar is and how it is
used within the warez scene, AND knows a little bit more about
computers, cryptography, file formats and file transfer protocols
might realize that it's not such a good idea after all?"
,KptnBlåskägg,2005-08-16T01:13Z,"Thisisnotme: Oh, so you DO have arguments, but you are keeping them

You know that people who read this will understand that you are lost for decent things to say when you start changing my words, right? I didn't say that everybody was like that, I was just making a point that a lot (most, according to my experience) people start liking the scene-system when they understand it.


""Oh, so you DO have arguments, but you are keeping them secret. Well, I guess we'll just have to believe you then. Or not."" Yes, I am keeping them secret because it is not appropriate to post them on a public and well-monitored site like this. I've said that enough times now.

You give the indication that you don't know how the scene works, but still you bad-mouth the system. To me, that just makes you look like an ignorant guy. You might not be, but after reading your posts I have an impression of it."
,KptnBlåskägg,2005-08-16T01:57Z," You did not just speak about people starting to like it when they
 learned it, you also admitted to assuming I knew nothing about it
 just because I disagreed with you. Anyway, your reluctance to give us
 any concrete argument, even though you claim all the information you
 would reveal is already public, kinda indicates that you really don't
 know or are too afraid to be proven wrong. But this was kinda funny:
 ""You give the indication that you don't know how the scene works, but
 still you bad-mouth the system."" in combination with you admitting to
 assuming anyone bad-mouthing the system is not knowing how it works
 means that you are completely unable to even consider any criticism
 of the system. Face it, if you are going to get out of this without
 looking like the ignorant guy, you will at least have to reveal
 enough information to explain, e.g., how a security system built on
 CRC32 can be secure?
"
,KptnBlåskägg,2005-08-16T02:55Z,"
 OK, you're getting annoying. In a big part of your comment you are
 trying to defend yourself against having prejudices against people
 not agreeing with you. Before you try to defend yourself any more,
 please read this part of your previous comment again: --- ""What is
 really disturbing about your comment is that you just assume that I
 don't know anything about the scene. I'm guessing that you assume
 that because I don't agree with you on the .rar issue, that as soon
 as you learn the secret rituals of the scene, there is no doubt about
 whether rar should be used?"" Spot-on. --- I'm not trying to twist
 your words, you made that point quite clear. And I do read what you
 write, but if you write something in one place, you can't
 quote another place where you say something else as some kind of
 proof of not having said it. The part about me not
 trusting your arguments before you reveal them might be getting old,
 but what is stupid is trying to argue with secret arguments. If you
 can't reveal any of your arguments, don't argue. Anything else is
 just silly. Just as silly as your story with the one person knowing
 the secret -- you said that the ""secret"" was easy to get through
 Google, so the people you don't want to know it already do. Your will
 also need to look over your odds calculation, real fakes will happen
 as soon as someone wants them to happen, and you will be unprepared.
 It's extra silly when real cryptographical hashes are (almost)
 as cheap as CRC32 on modern hardware. The fake .avi files are another
 story -- they are a consequence of the .rar system. If the system was
 built on real signatures directly on the .avi files, there would not
 be much of a problem, but as long as only the .rar files are signed
 (especially when they are as poorly signed as they are today) there
 will always be .avi files around, and verifying them will be hard.
 You also seem to repeat over and over again that you get
 ""indications"" that I am ""ignorant"", but you have never come up with a
 single example. What is it I have said that makes you think that? 
 Concrete examples, please.
 Finally, before you say stuff like ""so that I don't have to prove you
 wrong on so many points one more time"", you might want to first prove
 me wrong at least once."
,KptnBlåskägg,2005-08-16T03:34Z," Your case is to tell me to google, but you won't reveal what to
 google for or why, so it's kind of impossible to know what you have
 in mind, and I do know enough to realize without doubt that the .rar
 scheme is weak, unnecessary and silly. The only thing I have gotten
 out of you is a defense of the hash weakness which you base on
 kindergarten security mistakes. You also make a point about believing
 me to not know anything about the scene, but refusing to point out
 where I have said something wrong or what you don't think I know, and
 why any of that should matter. As is evident to anyone reading
 through the comments below, it is very strange that *you* claim that
 *I* have used non-existant facts. At least you say one good thing:
 ""Building a case without information whatsoever is in my mind not a
 great idea."". Remember that before you comment again."
,Thisisnotme,2005-08-16T03:53Z,"""Your case is to tell me to google, but you won't reveal what to google for or why, so it's kind of impossible to know what you have in mind.""

Hehe, take a wild guess. It is not ""free porn"".

""You also make a point about believing me to not know anything about the scene.""

Well, do you?

If you just would bother to do a little research you'd probably understand it, but as long as you seem to refuse to learn something about the subject in matter you will stay as unknowing, but if that is your choice. Have fun."
,KptnBlåskägg,2005-08-16T04:14Z,"

 The problem with telling me to google about the scene is that I
 already know quite a bit about it, so you must have some specific
 details in mind or I already know it. Especially since the .rar issue
 can be settled without any particular details about the scene (hint:
 transport coding and storage format are in the real world generally
 two different things), there must be some other very specific details
 you are thinking about. Unless you tell me exactly what they are, I'm
 unable to find them. The fact that there are tons of fundamentally
 flawed defenses of the .rar scheme out there doesn't make it any
 easier to find anything. And until you have pointed out those
 ultra-secret arguments for .rar, all I have is quite a lot of
 arguments against .rar and none whatsoever for .rar, so my mind is
 made up. You are welcome to try to convert me, but you won't do it
 without giving a single argument, especially not if you want me to
 trust your judgment and at the same time reveal your amateurish
 security knowledge."
,jc,2005-08-16T04:54Z,"Guys, stop the ranting, it's pointless. Sceners will do things their way, and you can't really change that, but once it gets in the hands of the BitTorrent distributors, common sense dictates that unraring is the most logical approach. As soon as it is given to the masses in a reliable resumable protocol, the masses no longer need the protections that the original scene distribution methods had. In conclusion, sceners can do it however the fuck they want, uploaders can do it however the fuck they want (and unraring is more logical than having redundant rar files; I'm glad Lundis does the unraring for BSG et al releases they do!). Welcome to anarchy. Quic bitching."
,KptnBlåskägg,2005-08-16T05:05Z,"jc: Well said, but there's one thing missing: a decent signature of the .avi file should be provided by the release groups. With that in place, they can use any obsolete technology they like internally without it bothering the outside world (except for the occational kid whining about original releases). Unfortunately, today they seem to think that a (extremely weak) signature on the .rar files is enough."
