   2. Navigate to the following key:
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}
   3. Click on this key and in the right pane and right-click on UpperFilters and choose Delete.
   4. Repeat the process for the LowerFilters values.

Reboot.  Job done!"
,TrenTech,2008-04-23T04:40Z,I take it this isn't free or cracked if everyone is trying to uninstall it. From what I've seen there is no crack or work around for this yet. It actaully is a decent program if your computer isn't old and slow. 
,cbyp1981,2008-06-22T22:39Z,"I don't know why you're bothering, OneCare is made by microsoft... how good and responsive do you think they are at security???

I even had to give Symantec a nudge this week when a crap av picked up a virus before our corp one did.... 

We need security products BECAUSE of microsoft!

AntiVir and NOD32 came out v.high, unfortunately avg is lagging nowadays..."
