,I come in peace,2006-04-13T01:23Z,I think he is messing with us.  I have tried several different cd creation programs and no luck just one hell of a waste of my time. 
,nicke_lt,2006-04-19T18:38Z,"No, iÂ´m not messing with you. This is what you need: CDRWIN_5.05.001

I used this one to make the image, and i tested to burn it with it as well."
,pms1,2006-09-11T17:54Z,"Thank you very much!
I had no problem burning this image using CDRWIN V-5."
,palyniam,2008-05-28T13:10Z,dont download it dont work
,Snaus,2009-01-24T11:57Z,"tnks nicke.
Sounds great.
For all the rest of you guys.
Just download the image, mount it and you'll see 12 cda files.
Put them in nero or something like that (audio cd) and play it from your dvd player that has a dts output.
I played it from my cd player with digital output, connected to a standalone dts decoder (Technics SH-AC500D) and even that works.
Remeber that dts is nothing more then encoded wave!
Great download!"

,Trexian66,2010-04-02T18:04Z,"CDRWIN_5.05.001 Does not function on Vista ultimate 64 bit.

I cannot for the life of me burn this one. I have every multimedia codex known to man installed, and rarely do i come across anything i cannot access.

You need to use a more recent version or nero."

,horrgakx,2011-05-02T21:31Z,"It's not straight forward as I couldn't get CDRWIN to burn the image - so this is how I did it.

I used Daemon Tools to open the CD image.
I opened Nero Burning Rom, chose to create a new audio CD
I drag & drop the files from Daemon Tools virtual drive into Nero
Burn the image from Nero.

Why not make a standard ISO file - or just have .WAV's or something to make it easier?"
,4roger4,2012-02-07T13:12Z,"Thanks for post, DTS cd works fine.

open Nero express make music cd
drag and drop files into nero express
