The last movie of Michele Soavi (whos been retired from directing since then as far as I know). This is a briliant zombie movie with a great touch of romance and comedy mixed into it.

This is a Xvid encode of "Dellamorte.Dellamore.DVDR.PAL-ACAB", wish I could reseed the whole DVD but I dont have enough bandwidth for it, so this will have to do unless someone else feels like reseeding it.. Theres a lot of people stuck tehre at 99,9% so if you do happen to have the rar files please do go and seed for a while.

english sound, no subtitle.
