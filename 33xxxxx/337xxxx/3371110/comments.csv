So what would the top ten U.S. attacks be?  Us blowing the crap out of 30 brown people sharing one AK-47?  Our well-trained troops molesting unarmed prisoners?  
Yeah the Iraqi regime were bad guys, but how many have Israel tortured and murdered for political and religious reasons?
Religion in U.S. policy, nawwwww."
