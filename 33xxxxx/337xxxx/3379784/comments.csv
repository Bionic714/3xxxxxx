,satyrosjay1,2012-01-09T00:11Z,So English or Swedish subs?
,dothackjhe,2012-05-23T12:44Z,"The movie is hardcoded in English. Using subtitles in other language is possible by downloading external subtitles on the internet, but may overlap on the screen due to the hardcoded subtitle. "
,dothackjhe,2012-05-23T12:45Z,"Classic movie quality by the way. 

A = 10
