####BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD, SEASON 4 XVID, 32 EPISODES WITH MUSIC VIDEOS####

NOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: If you downloaded the thanksgiving release, you probably should not download [[[PART 2]]].
The same season 4 episodes are in part 2, the quality is a little bit better, but not worth it to redownload IMO. If you didn't
download the thanksgiving release (or don't know what I'm talking about), download all three episode packages.

#################Release Notes###################

27 of the episodes in this release were captured directly from MTV2, i.e. svideo from cable box to my Radeon 9800 aiw.
Episodes were captured to huffYUV, the video was encoded to xvid with virtualdub, and the audio was encoded to VBR MP3 with Besweet.
ALL of the Music Videos are on each ep, these were some of the best parts of B&B. The retail DVDs don't contain Music Videos,
that is why I didn't do DVD Rips. I just noticed the other day that I have been encoding with 4:3 PAR (Pixel Aspect Ratio), for most players
(I have tried windows media, windows media player classic, and ati file player) this shouldn't be a problem.
For players that respect PAR though (videolan), the picture will look squeezed in a little bit. Episodes were deinterlaced with MAP.

I do not know who captured the other 5 episodes. AFAIK, MTV does not play these 5 episodes. The quality is very good,
364x284 PAL DIVX, but not as good as my encodes. These eps were not included on my DVDR release, so some of you guys who downloaded
that might want to download the PART 3 DIVX. Then again, they will be included on a later DVDR, so you may not want too.

*This release is the best quality of Beavis and Butthead with music videos out on the net.

*It is much better than all of those old crappy rips.
