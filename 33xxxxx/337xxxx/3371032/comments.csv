Anyone know how to fix this?"

,squall_leonhart69r,2011-05-19T09:42Z,"As of sometime 2010, Reloaded editions of this game DO NOT work on XP, Vista or 7 due to security patches that prevent the loading of certain packed executables and DLL's."

,MisterDegenerationX,2011-10-30T15:25Z,Does this work or not????
,casmo00,2011-12-29T20:25Z,"i installed the game and downloaded the Sudeki v1.0 [MULTI] Unprotected EXE from http://m0004.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_sudeki.shtml#Sudeki

i had to also download Sudeki NO INTRO FIX also to get this to work ""windows 7 64bit""

the game runs smooth so far.

Web/info from JayaTakayama  I'm just trying to help anyone getting stuck on the intro.

""kept getting stuck at the intro"""
,dondamov123,2012-03-04T15:28Z,"I've tried downloading that link from http://m0004.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_sudeki.shtml#Sudeki v1.0 [MULTI] Unprotected EXE

But after i run the game, it gets stuck on the loading screen (at least that's what i think is), just that part after the puppet show intro :("
,dondamov123,2012-03-04T15:35Z,"(Sorry for the double post)

But yeah i definitely think it is the loading screen that keeps getting stuck on, since there's a small blue bar at the bottom of the screen, but it never moves :/"
,armix122,2012-04-14T23:38Z,I have same problem like dondamov123 please help
,Abyss-Dragon,2012-05-11T09:03Z,"Seeding, will seed for a while. Let's get some more seeds please.

Sudeki was a game I used to love but never finished. So far it works, but I am only level 6.

Much thanks for the torrent."
,Abyss-Dragon,2012-05-11T09:09Z,"OH, I should mention for people having issues with the game. 

It worked flawlessly for me with no extra patches or settings on windows XP Professional SP3. I doubt it would help but the torrent works. So it may be either compatibility issues or something random."
,alexbnc,2012-07-06T10:31Z,"This game burned my laptop's graphics card (poor integrated piece of junk), so I couldn't finish it. Now seeding at 50MB/S for a while."
,Spinfx,2012-08-10T17:00Z,"Just wanted to throw in this comment: the game's okay, but the v1.1 patch was never cracked - it fixes the ""too fast, sounds like chipmunks"" speech issue which triggers every now and then. This sucks because it really kills the immersion when the cutscenes sound like the voice actors were stoned. Other than that the game was pretty ok, although the combat system wasn't exploited to the fullest - as usual, by the time you get the best weapons it's nearly the end of the game. Meh."
