,SlipNaxos,2007-04-03T18:10Z,Would have been easier just to have made an ISO file ;-)
,aliasdavidoff,2008-04-13T16:58Z,"OK, I figured it out after only a few hours! Here's how to do it:
1. Open CDRWIN and click ""Record disk"" (the upper left icon with a disk, a star and some kind of rainbow-line).
2. Click ""Load tracks..."" (ok, it's not tracks that you are supposed to load but an image, but this is the way to do it, believe me)
3. Click ""Add"". Chose the image by first chosing ""All format"" in ""File format"", otherwise you won't see your image...really smart....
4. Well, add your image and ""OK"".
5. CDRWIN compiles the image and tell you that ""1"" tracks has been added.
6. Click ""Record disk"" and the burning starts...

It's SO simple with CDRWINs brilliant GUI...why didn't I found out earlier...
