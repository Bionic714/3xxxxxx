,Branstrom,2005-08-17T23:57Z,"It's not the second season. It's the complete first season, 23 episodes + the 2-in-1 season finale. DVD-covers are apparently included, don't know if it's the real ones."
,DocNorton,2005-08-18T00:33Z,"Branstrom,  if you read it again he is saying this is the second lost series TORRENT - not a torrent of the second series.  As in there are 2 torrents for the lost series."
