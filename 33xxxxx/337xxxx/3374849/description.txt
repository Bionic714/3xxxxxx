   It's not where you start - It's where you start again.
   A black and white masterpiece, opening with the great "Jockey Full of 
   Bourbon" by Tom Waits. Three men in a Louisiana prison and with different, 
   but similar in some sense, personalities. 

   "He has captured man's fear within himself, and, the ability to hide that 
   fear. It takes a director of great courage and knowledge of self to pull 
   that one off without boring you.
     If you're a fan of Joel Schumaucher or James Cameron, this is not the 
   film for you. But if your a fan of people, and, the human condition, the 
   mirror reflects back, 2 hours at a time, and Jarmusch is right behind it."

   Great photo, plot and directing even though most people (including myself) 
   thought it slow, uninteresting the first time they see it. It really grows 
   from screening to screening. Details in the tone of voices, choices of 
   words, framings, angles captures you and the life of these poor (?) souls 
   start to mean a lot to you. And of course the superb soundtrack from Tom!
