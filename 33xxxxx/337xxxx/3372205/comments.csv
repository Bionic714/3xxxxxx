,enjoyeverymoment,2011-12-22T18:47Z,From 22/12/11 the COMPLETE works will be seeded. I decided to seed it all instead of some individual ones as seeding the whole collection I believe it will allow everyone will be able to get the pdf they are looking for and perhaps check out and keep or delete what they are not. And at the same time keep it all in one organised / easy to search torrent. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6905797/Sam_Fryman_Complete_Works_Nov_2011_PDF_E-Book
