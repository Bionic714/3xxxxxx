,serieta,2005-08-17T17:06Z,"Peter and others after downloading the 
""Microsoft Digital Image Suite 2006.7z"" file
Start the 7-zip program and select the mentioned file.
Choose the extract option and the following files will be created:
DIPS_CD1.iso
DIPS_CD2.iso
and one .txt file

OK Adobe Photoshop is better for the Pro's (with knowledge of the program), but this program is more easy to use and the results are very good.

I know my meaning is not objective !!!
Everybody has to admit that it's a good eye-catcher."

why donÂ´t use rar as usual??"
,LMD,2006-12-12T14:31Z,"I can't get CD2 to work.

I have done just as you have written it should be done, but when I try to use some of the ""master"" under projects - it asks for CD2 and even though I put it in the machine and press ok - nothing happens.

I even tried to reinstall and choose the full version - but it still doesn't recognize CD2.

Could someone please help me?"
,piggy in miggle,2007-01-11T22:49Z,"this is 1 awesome programme, not as good as photo shp but much easier to use, download worked 1st time after discs was burnt"
,jaicapco,2007-06-12T01:13Z,"Doesn't this have a resizing option other than for mobile devices? I remember it having an option for resizing to emails or internet, etc."
,lizzy1216,2007-12-18T06:37Z,"i would never argue that this is better than photoshop, but it is much easier to use, and i have used it for at least 18 months."
[T],idf560,2009-04-07T19:23Z,Thanks for this. My CD copy is damaged. Really useful for quick fixes and the majority of basic photo work.
