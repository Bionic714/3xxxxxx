4 wav files directly recorded from record to pc (not edited by me).
tif files including the pages of the booklet and the albumcover
Rare recording never seen on CD but you can edit these wav files yourself and maybe even produce it on CD yourself.
This one is brought to you because my wife says "Kathleen Ferrier was the best operasinger ever and this was the best one she ever made"
This recording contains a 1951 performance. It's remastered from tapes of two dutch radiostations who've been broadcasting this concert. The original recording was mono (they did not have stereo in 1951 or stereo was at least very rare in that period of time). The remaster makes it possible to enjoy the music through all your speakers.
