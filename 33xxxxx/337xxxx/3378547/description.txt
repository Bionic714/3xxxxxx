of Spirit Zone.

After more than 6 Albums and over 70 releases on worldwide known Labels comes the 7th Album of Shiva Chandra aka Daniel Vernunft 'Change of Air'.

He has intelligently developed his own very independent trance style by taking acoustic samples and integrating them in a homogenous, complete music. In co-operation with some successful Djs and live producers he created and experimented beyond the usual limits in musical style as well as in production processes.

In this album 'Change of Air' it is shown that many different styles can be mixed very successfullyBy influences of four co-produced tracks together with his brother Sebastian Vernunft, earlier psychedelic inluences return.

The tracks are all together main floor capable, especially during the early morning with cracking bases and kicks, pumping progressive and carried by psychedelic melodies and surfaces which are followed by rave melodies that lead the whole to an euphoric peak.Each track has ist personal recognize worth and therefor the overall view of this album is excellent, which could quite be observed on the dancefloor, too..

Style: Psytrance

Released: Aug. 2005/33"
