,bogies,2005-07-29T14:28Z,Probably one of the most beautiful movies ever made.
,zubastick,2005-07-29T22:12Z,One of the best films ever!
,antiterrorstyrkan,2005-07-31T03:09Z,"yay, excellent! :) "
,Chrismania,2005-08-01T16:07Z,"This is the first rip i have ever made. I ordered the programm to rip the film on 2 files, which i tought he did. Next time i rip a dvd i will be more carefull. Sorry for the trouble."
,Temptation,2005-08-01T22:29Z,"Thanks in advance for the movie.  This is a really underrated Kubrick movie.  I saw this a while back and it has stayed with me, which is one of the signs of a great movie.  Not only is the movie beautiful to look at, but the story is very engaging and tragic.  Kubrick is the master of screen composition.  You could enjoy this movie simply as eye-candy if you want.. just marvel at the cinematography and the detail in each shot... this is really a gorgeous looking movie.. and great classical music in the soundtrack.  Looking forward to watching this again.. and btw.. don't worry about the extra file.  Everyone makes mistakes... We appreciate your efforts to rip and upload this.. Also, mishima, thanks for the warning about the extra CD - for people who aren't aware, depending on which BitTorrent client you are using, you can selectively download particular files in a torrent if you want.  I use Azureus and it has that feature.  "
,Temptation,2005-08-01T22:35Z,"Btw.. how's the quality?  Could you provide some technical specs, i.e., codec.. resolution, bitrate?  would appreciate it.. "
,mishima,2005-08-05T17:35Z,"No worries Chrismania, just thought I'd ask in case I misunderstood your intentions. You live, you learn! As Temptation points out, in a good BT client you can choose not to download the second file, at least now we know we don't need it.

I actually appreciate having just the one file since I burn everything on DVDR to use in my Pio575, saves me the interrupt as the next file loads.

I also found an english subtext on www.extratitles.to that doesn't need to be resynced. For all us non-native english speaking cretins who can at least read this fine language!

Now all I need is my woman by my side and a peaceful evening in front of this seeming masterpiece.

Thanks!

,Nikitn,2007-12-09T23:17Z,"Oh, hey, i got a problem with this film, and i hope somebody could help me! :)
Ok, i downloaded the film, and all stuff sucsessfully. Then, in the download/barry lyndon 1975 directory i only find to files, and my media player(windows media player 9) cant play either! :( So i wonder, does one need some kind of special program to play this movie, or is something wrong? Please help me, i really want to see this movie! :D"
,Nikitn,2007-12-10T16:43Z,"OOps, sorry, i apparently have windows media player 11, the newest edition. :) But i tried these files on qucktime too, but no no sucsess...:( "
,Nikitn,2007-12-15T15:58Z,"Aint there anyone who can help me? lol.
:("
,tscanner,2008-03-01T22:25Z,"Well, if you're coming back here after at 2 months, maybe try VLC media player. Usually plays everything..."
,delimanyagi,2008-03-07T02:48Z,"just download the first file guys. the second file is not necessary, just a replication of the first file from the 80th minute of the movie. tell your torrent clients to download the first file only."
,mrsticky,2008-03-25T21:46Z,"This is one of the greatest movies ever! I agree with Temptation, it was really underrated. but Kubrick was underrated himself so..
Thanks for the upload"
