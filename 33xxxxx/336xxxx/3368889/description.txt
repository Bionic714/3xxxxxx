Release Notes:

Since forming eight years ago, in 1997, the members of The Juliana Theory have
spent few days outside of a recording studio or concert venue. The band released
its first two albums, "Understand This Is A Dream" (1999) and "Emotion Is Dead"
(2000), as well as the "Music from Another Room ep" (2001) on the independent
label Tooth and Nail Records. In 2002, the band signed to Epic Records and
released the acclaimed cd ?Love? (2003). When not in the studio, the band has
been on the road, criss-crossing the US/Canada over a dozen times and touring
Europe and Australia. The Juliana Theory is now hard at work putting the
finishing touches on their brand new record, ?DEADBEAT SWEETHEARTBEAT.? Expect
an early fall 2005 release on the band's own imprint label Paper Fist.
