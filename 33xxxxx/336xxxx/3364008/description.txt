"The music presented on these two compact discs makes the consolidation of several years of musical and philosphical 

practice. Almost every piece was conceived during moments of intense stillness or `magical vacuity'. For this I 

acknowledge the influence of the late Austin Osman Spare, whose technique for creating `automatic drawing' has found a 

sympathetic resonance in my own work. Of all the music I have made, this is, perhaps, the most personal and yet the 

least demostrative. Attempting nothing and existing purely for itself, it is, nevertheless, a practical music, ideally 

suited to the occultist in search of ritual atmosphere or serene meditation." - Bill Nelson 1987
