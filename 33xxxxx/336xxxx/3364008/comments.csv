There seems to be at least three schools of thought on seeding and eating.

1. Get it while its hot.
2. Find a nice group of people.
3. Hang in for the long haul.

I like all groups, but as a seeder I like the long haul best and I'm prepared to wait on the long haul, as well as eat some of my young -if they don't snuff themselves first.

(The reason I bail out of a swarm is often because I need some of my 55kup to go to more starving ones. I sometimes jump in and heap extra width on any who are struggling with my favourite lassie.)

Since the beginning of August 2005 I have modestly seeded, 10k each, five semi-rare albums. Apparently, since then, 452 people have a copy of one of those discs and while numbers are mildly flaky here, I have watched these torrents from the side of my eye and would vouch for about half that total; still.

We'll leave moot the point of honour among thieves.

There were long stretches when no one was around. I didn't mind.

Find something that you like a lot, (out of print is good), get a copy of maketorrent, put a condom on for new stuff; bask in the pleasure of the upglow.

p.s.  I find it a little odd that there has not been a single thank you in all that time. The world proceeds on that simplest of turns."

I've long loved Bill's music, I wish he'd spend more time holding a guitar than a paintbrush though!"
