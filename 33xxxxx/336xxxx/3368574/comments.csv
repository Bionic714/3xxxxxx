,Beaverlicker,2005-08-11T22:16Z,"hmm... episode 2 is due out the 15th of August. So how di you get epis 1-5 ?
Yeah!!How?"
,bluude,2005-08-11T22:38Z,"Probably not a fake
digital viewers have the option of showtime on demand.
That means they can download anything for the whole month. "
,chronjohnson,2005-08-12T04:43Z,"Obviously a fake from the US Drug Enforcement Agency, out to snake IP addresses for random raids."
,NavidaZ,2005-08-12T04:46Z,seed ^^ 
,papa47,2005-08-12T05:48Z,Episode 2 airs next week. How did you get it thru five?  Seems questionable.
,245,2005-08-12T08:39Z,was this fake or not??
,Morbo_JJ,2005-08-12T12:29Z,"I'm not too familiar with this sort of thing, so I have a question: Do I need to burn this on a DVD, or can I watch it without. This is an important question, seeing as I haven't got a DVD-writer ;)"
,plagio,2005-08-12T12:54Z,Just drag and drop the VIDEO_TS folder into the media player you are using and you are done
,Morbo_JJ,2005-08-12T13:07Z,alright. thanks for the quick answer. 
,ermias,2005-08-12T13:46Z,SO...has anybody downloaded the hole thing yet?....is it really the real thing?
,Morbo_JJ,2005-08-12T13:49Z,"Read bluude's and plagio's comments. they speak the truth (I think and hope ;))

Not that I can spot fake files, but the last few days I've heard from numerous people that they've downloaded ep. 1 to 5. So I guess (hope) this is the real thing"
,vking,2005-08-12T14:42Z,"Yes this works!
But the qulity is total rubbish. Never seen anything this bad. And it's in 4:3.
Thnx but Im gonna w8 for the real eps."
,pr0f0und,2005-08-12T15:05Z,"I downed it. Its legit. Episodes 1-5. Quality isnt that bad...its a comedy, who cares if their faces get scrambled...not like its star wars."
,w000ter,2005-08-12T15:21Z,"hopefully the entire series gets capped in HRHD:) it deserves it, mary louis parker is pretty:)"
,Morbo_JJ,2005-08-12T16:46Z,Quality is alright. Good enough for me anyway. 
,NavidaZ,2005-08-13T03:33Z,"nice thx, loved the show Quality was good enough. Keep up the good work "
,BimpnBerry,2005-08-13T20:56Z,ZenFerret - ever hear of newsgroups? thats why
,Havaianas,2005-08-14T11:53Z,wow 1-5! this real?
,oblodo,2005-08-15T19:30Z,"I guess ppl all over are stupid, and its the curse of humanity....  First, RAR files are used in newsgroups and via ftp, WERE most films and tv shows start their ""life""!!!!  later, it trickles down to you loosers with no IT  knowledge and no ftp server you can log on to , you ordinary p2p users... and thats ok... but don't bitch about things you do not understand. I am more flabergasted over the use of moronic words like ""dvd format""  wtf is that? ( i guess its mpeg2), and people making DVD's from xvid and other compressed sources. DVD's from VCD's and SVCD's.... and then the Mother of all Idiots, the one making DVD's from a xvid source.... If you are going to share a DVD, why not use ratDVD, a 6GB film is going to be 1,2 GB, and playable in WMP. And if you want to make a dvd, it will do so, with NO loss of quality. There should be a ""driving"" test for PC users, and ppl so stupid as to make DVD's from avi's and other re-encoded material, should have a large L put next to their IP, and it should pop up all over internet. The more morons with computers, the more idiotic, and lame files are going to be found out there. That said, Thanks for the files, and if you want better quality search for Weeds HR HDTV, its an amazingly good HDTV rip in xvid.
Oh, and yes, i am superior, I am better than most of you, and I have a LARGE PENIS...."
,oblodo,2005-08-15T20:41Z,"If anyone have the source files for this ""dvd"", please share it. The quality is 3 out of 5... looks like a vcd rip, encoded to mpeg2 ( why, why i ask)"
,StonerMan,2005-08-16T13:10Z,"This series rules..
Well, Anything about weed does rule though (Us potheads ya know)

Too bad the quality is barely watchable.
Thanks for the up though.
I second the ""share the source"" opinion"
,mb_carlton,2005-08-16T16:39Z,"@oblodo, my first thought was you must be an asshole, but everything you wrote is true (dunno about yer bollocks tho). I watched the first ep HR HDTV and it looked great, this however looks like sheit. Cool that you wanted to share rhino, but you should have mentioned the quality sux!"
,mb_carlton,2005-08-16T20:36Z,"However... This show is pretty damn funny, thank you rhinobucket!"
,a3dzone,2005-08-16T21:54Z,"the crappiest dvd format i ever seen. 
but the show is great. "
,hautsj,2005-08-17T11:57Z,"All of you need to stop bitching like little girls.  The quality looks like a converted mpeg1 to mpeg2.  Its not great, but it certainly is watchable. None of you would be able to watch it (FOR FREE!) if not for rhinobucket.  If you can seed something better, then, and only then, can you complain about the quailty.
Grow up."
,Softwarezer,2006-08-16T11:50Z,"Yeah, this is from season 1, not 2 as I foolishly thought based on the date of upload. Please note this in the description or file name or something next time.

As for quality, there are HDTV XViD's and DVD-R's out there for the visuofiles out there. Just search here on TPB. They also have more seeders.."
