The Pandamonium-No Presents For Me...Singles & Rarities(1966-72)
Bit.256
Ripped.From Reissued CD

This, the second Pandamonium album to appear on Radioactive, is a collection of singles, demos, acetates and other rarities culled from Bob Ponton and Martin Curtis's time spent in various London recording studios between 1966 and 1972. The 15 tracks (including an alternative version of a Pandamonium live favourite, 'My Old Flame') range from their spirited cover of Donovan's classic 'Season Of The Witch' (the band's version of which actually appeared before Donovan's) to the most popular of their CBS singles, 'No Presents For Me'. Although the musical styles vary with pleasing regularity, the quality of Ponton and Curtis's song writing is, as usual, consistent throughout. This collection of singles and rarities brings as up to the time the duo signed with Liberty and their only official album ever to see the light of day, Thoughts And Words, which the boys recorded with exWomble Mike Batt."
