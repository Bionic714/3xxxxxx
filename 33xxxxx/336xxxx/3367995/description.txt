Episode 1 : 30th August 2004.
How difficult is it to get a fatwa placed on someone? John travels to the UK Shariah court to find out - and he chooses an unlikely Australian rival as his proposed fatwa-ee. Next John takes a spirit walk in Arizona with the Peyote Way Church of God, and ingests the sacred Peyote drug in an attempt at divine insights into the universe. And what would be of our favourite Channel 9 shows if Jamie Packer was to become a practising scientologist?
