,Zeuzz,2005-07-24T17:04Z,jävla spanjorer borde bannas från sidan alltså....
,oktan,2005-07-24T18:23Z,no habla ingles ? RETARD!
,oktan,2005-07-24T18:27Z,"thank god for google translate. http://www.google.com/language_tools?hl=en ..this is what the fucking spanish idiot left out in google way..... ""The Best Italian Actresses like Baby Marilyn among others have created this pedaso of pelicula that sera of the taste of all"""
,antiterrorstyrkan,2005-07-24T20:17Z,"great, it translated everything except what i could not figure out from reading the original post.. :( ""pedaso of pelicula that sera"""
,micaele,2005-07-24T21:18Z,"Zeuzz: Why whine over the spanish when YOU write in swedish? Try to understand that this tracker is multilingual and doesn't care if you're Swedish, English or Vietnamese. And that's the way we want it to be."
,Don_Porre,2005-07-25T02:35Z,"micaele: for starters this page is a swedish site. and the only way for it to be legal is if it is in sweden/swedish. and to be classified as a swedish site it should have swedish as a mother tongue. i've noticed that there ain't alot of swedish being talked here anymore so i'm a little concearned for the page...

and for those of u who may wonder why it has to be in swedish to be a legal site: sweden is the only country were torrent files isn't classified as illegal. but if this page should use so much english that it's all of a sudden classified as an english page then there's gona be trouble...

and i accutually don't know how the new law in sweden against piracy says about torrent files but i hope and think that the ops / webmasters of tpb knows so :)

for all i know that's how it is and i'm stickin' to it ;)

peace outy!"
,Wittgenstein,2005-07-25T03:13Z,Incesto? Är detta barnporr?
,kukruneskuk,2005-07-25T10:11Z,Zeuzz Vaddå ska dom bannas bara för du inte fattar vad porrfilmen handlar om ?Spelar det egentligen nån roll när du ändå bara tänker sitta och runka till den?
,tikveni4e,2005-07-25T10:19Z,I don't think the basis for classification of a torrent server a Swedish has anything to do with the language used in the user comments. I has rather more to do with where the tracker is physically based and who the IP is registered to.
,nyttanoje,2005-07-25T14:08Z,"Men han kunde ju skriva på engelska åtminstonde. Så man fick nån hum om vad filmen handlade om Även om man bara skall runka till den.

Titeln gör ju en lite skeptisk."
,nyttanoje,2005-07-25T14:09Z,Sen e det tydligen 112 somladdat hem filmen. Kan ingen av dem skriva vad filmen handlar om?
,lkjhg,2005-07-25T17:43Z,"Jeg fant coveret her: http://www.divxtotal.com/gratis-descarga-torrent-xxx-Incesto-A-La-Italiana-297.html
Det er fortsatt på spansk men man får i det minste en liten ide om hva det dreier seg om."
,sotireison,2007-11-20T15:38Z,thanks
,hovartm,2008-03-01T11:52Z,"Who cares aboutn the language
It is the moving pictures that we all come for!!!"
,randystrange,2008-05-11T07:16Z,"To USAans (America is a continent): Spanish is a neolatin language, and English is a barbarian language. There are other countries in the world, faggots (""in English please""s like that make yours being the most hated)."
,kreem,2011-04-22T17:45Z,Whats the big deal - 'Baby Marilyn' looks like your average 25yo pornwhore. There is absolutely nothing risque about this torrent.
,idenn3,2012-08-25T08:29Z,The Best Italian actresses like Marilyn Baby inter pedaso have created this film to be to everyone's taste
