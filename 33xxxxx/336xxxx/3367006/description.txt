Problems with the wind0ws Registry are a common cause of wind0ws crashes and error messages. By using Error Doctor regularly and repairing your registry your system should not only be more stable but it will also help wind0ws and your software run faster. By default, Error Doctor scans the registry for all types of errors. This is the simplest way to clean up the registry. Automatic Scan is recommended for 'non-technical' users. After the scan is complete, Error Doctor will show you a full list of errors with details, and let you fix individual invalid entries or all invalid entries of a certain type. Before scanning your registry for errors, Error Doctor gives you the option to create a backup file(s) that can be used to undo the changes.
