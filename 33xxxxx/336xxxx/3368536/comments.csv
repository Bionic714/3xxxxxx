,__________,2005-08-13T14:33Z,"Respect and admiration for upping such an excellent .torrent, much appreciation from the UK.....;~)

zLeH"
,appiejus,2005-08-13T16:58Z,That should be: until there are more seeders.
,TUSSFC,2005-08-14T02:03Z,"Can I just ask for confirmation - is there 26 episodes? Most places have episodes 24 and 25 joined, but I have heard that they are actually episodes 25 and 26 (the finale) and episode 24 is actually different and incredibly difficult to find. Many people are watching it through, missing an episode without realising. Can anyone confirm this for sure?"
,fazed up,2005-08-14T03:10Z,"There are 25 Eps in this series.

Details: http://www.lost-tv.com/episodes/"
,appiejus,2005-08-14T10:19Z,"Episodes 24 and 25 were broadcasted one after the other, because they thought it would be nice to do so with the last two episodes, like a special ending. Therefore you will find mostly eps. 24 and 25 recorded as ""one"" videofile. There are some people who cut them theirselves to have eps. 24 and 25 seperated. That story about eps.26 is bullshit! Just watch these episodes and find out! Enjoy!"
,kud@s,2005-08-14T13:16Z,many thanks for packing this and uploading it. it makes me sad how people will just leech all thy can and never give something back to the people who gave it to them in the first place. so come on guys and seed it for the rest of us todownload and injoy as well please.
,fazed up,2005-08-14T15:25Z,"There is only 1 seed at the moment, Appiejus"
,kud@s,2005-08-14T20:25Z,many thanks to you appiejus keep the grate work of seeding going.  top stuff 
,Harpdog,2005-08-14T20:26Z,hey applejus I was not having a dig at yourself. I appreciate your upload.  I was just ranting a little. 
,Harpdog,2005-08-15T00:35Z,It funny that appiejus calls me an idiot.  He should look in the mirror you fucking half witted nonce.  This torrent only needs to be approx 9GB but you have inflated by leaving all the original rar files and the extracted movie files in every other folder.  You are a twat a price fucking idiot your a waste of my bandwidth. In fact your taking the piss. nuff said.
,fazed up,2005-08-15T01:11Z,"Keep up the good work appiejus, much appreciated.
Harpdog, show a little appreciation. You'd be whinging if he decided to stop seeding it. Or you could just look for it somewhere else...? "
,Harpdog,2005-08-15T01:41Z,"I would give a flying fuck if he stopped seeding it, as I was getting less than 1k per sec anyway, I have found on another tracker now. and it is 8.8gb as it should be.  11.32 gb what an idiot."
,fazed up,2005-08-15T01:45Z,"Obviously not that much of an idiot, he's got the series....you don't!"
,Apple Bombs,2005-08-15T04:37Z,"Man Thanks :D

I live In UK

3rd episode Just came out

Lol"
,appiejus,2005-08-15T06:59Z,"Just hang yourself on a barbed wire, you little fucking insect. Enough said, just fuck off, go tell your twisted fanatasies somewhere else. Very tough, hiding behind your computer. Wanker. I wish i could meet you, so i can pull a gun on you and pull the tricker, brains everywhere. Now fuck off, little tramp, you are my bitch and i will fuck you up, harpdoggy."
,appiejus,2005-08-15T10:17Z,"Can live with that finalprophecy. If you don't like this one, search further. BTW the dvd of Lost comes out in september according to amazon.com."
,arunz,2005-08-15T19:03Z,"Appie - Harpdog is being a bit of an idiot but he does have a point that you have duplicated a few of the episodes in rar format. To everyone thinking of downloading this torrent: make sure you tick ""do not download"" on the rar files to avoid duplication."
,appiejus,2005-08-15T19:59Z,"Yes i agree, stupid mistake, won't make one like that again, it's my first time upping with azureus. Anybody got an idea to undo this mistake (other then making a new torrent), without the downloaders run into problems?"
,arunz,2005-08-15T21:07Z,"I don't think there is a way, but just tell all downloaders : CLICK ""DO NOT DOWNLOAD"" on the rar files using your bittorrent program  to avoid duplication!!"
,kud@s,2005-08-15T21:10Z,"hi appiejus

cant u turn files on and off while seeding? as im using bitcomet and it allows me to turn files on and off while downloading etc, just wunderd if azureus had a feature like this."

,cabalist,2005-08-16T11:52Z,What happened with the only seeder? :(
,Homer_S,2005-08-16T19:21Z,"I dont know?  :(
I dont understand why ppl can seed untill more ppl got it down and can help..."
,appiejus,2005-08-17T09:36Z,"Yes, you are right! I am fooling everyone. Sorry i hurt your feelings by calling you names and all, i just wanna have attention my shrink said. If you give me your adress, i come by to talk about our bad beginning of our peaceful relationship. You are right about everything you say,guess you're a shrink, you know everything about me, what i think, YOU ARE JUST GREAT, I LOVE YOU, FREAK!!!"
,rd353535,2005-08-17T22:39Z,"I just had to comment... EPISODE 23 IS MISSING! So what has your bittorrent client got to do with checking what's in the folder you're sharing? (The answer is nothing, I thought I'd better point that out just to make sure you understand). So, yes, I disable all the files I don't need. But whats this? I do need 'Lost.S01E23.HDTV.XviD.avi' but where is it? Not in my torrents file list that's for sure. Anyone else missing it? I too have gone elsewhere."
,appiejus,2005-08-17T23:32Z,"Eps 24 is mentioned twice in the list. If you look at the details you will see, the first eps 24 is actually 23, eps 24 only comes together with eps 25."
,pukrmo,2008-05-12T21:40Z,hey could someone help with seeding please? i really need to download this season! thx
