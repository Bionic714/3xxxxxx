,NewGod,2005-08-13T00:12Z,What is this .chm? Do I need a program to unpack it with?
,SirKillalot,2005-08-13T00:30Z,"CHM is a windows help file format. It consists of compressed html files, wich is searchable, indexed and so on. Beats the old .hlp format, but guess its not much good if you use *nix or Mac."
[T],TheTeaher,2005-08-13T09:31Z," xCHM - 0.9.0 is a Freeware reader for MacOSx and if you are into linux/solaris/bsd you could try xCHM or GnoCHM if you use Gnome.

There is also a lot of different converters and export programs avaialble for the .chm format."
