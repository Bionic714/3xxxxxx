,rci,2005-08-10T19:59Z,"you damn right, mGoLos. that's the unbelievable truth, today US empire doesn't fear anymore a bad opinion or that their actions are legal or not, everybody sees that... or that the rest of the world raises political or military or economical opposition... they even don't give a shit if their own US citizen protest by millions or disobey or revolution.. because they already kidnap torture and assassinate in death camps all over the planet, and they will do it in a large scale without any doubt."
