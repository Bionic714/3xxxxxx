You don't think it could happen to you ? Obviously those rounded up and
killed didn't think it could happen to them either. How could decent people
have witnessed such atrocities and still said nothing ? Are we going to do
the same here as they cart off one by one those individuals who are taking
a stand for the rights of the citizens as they expose the truth happening
behind the scenes ? How could we let it happen ?
