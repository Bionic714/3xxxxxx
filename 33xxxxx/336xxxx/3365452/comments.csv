,cdwillis,2008-02-10T04:50Z,The movie is in Italian with no subtitles. Waste of time.
,HannibalCrossesTheAlps,2009-05-29T14:42Z,"This movie is in English...though it seems a bit squeezed from 1.85:1 to 1.66:1.....It is a good rip and not distracting. Sound seems to be low, but a worthy download. Thanks for the upload, va1210!"
,S3nd41,2011-02-21T18:49Z,Is it the original italian with subtitles?
