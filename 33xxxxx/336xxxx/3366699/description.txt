Que viva Mexico was a documentary shot by Grigori Aleksandrov and Sergei M. Eisenstein in 1932. Eisenstein's vision was to end up with a movie about Mexico in six parts called "Calavera", "Sandunga", "Maguey", "Fiesta", "Soldadera", and "Epilogue". The project was cancelled before it was completed due to cost overruns and months-delayed completion, and the producers refused to let Eisenstein attempt to edit anything from the material he had finished after Stalin called him back to the USSR. The 200,000-plus feet of footage was later Edited by Grigori Aleksandrov and Esfir Tobak in 1979. They also added a narrator voice in Spanish.
