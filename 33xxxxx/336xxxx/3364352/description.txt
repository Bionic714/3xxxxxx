SYNOPSIS:
 Melinda Gordon is a young newlywed with the unique ability to communicate
 with the earthbound spirits of people who have died -- and who seek her help.
 Melinda uses her gift to relay significant messages and important information
 to the living, but sometimes the messages she receives are intense and
 confusing. As a result, she is often met with questions and skepticism by the
 survivors. But when Melinda is able to help both the lost souls who contact
 her and those who are still alive, she knows that her unique talent is an
 asset and not a liability.
