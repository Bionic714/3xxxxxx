,KptnBlåskägg,2005-08-08T23:49Z,"larsmt: The other torrent contains .rar files, so this torrent is very welcome even though the other exists."
,larsmt,2005-08-09T03:10Z,"Glad to hear that this single-file is useful after all :-)

I have now watched the episode, and everything is there and works perfectly well! (just to let you know)."
,larsmt,2005-08-11T00:54Z,Aha! Interesting! That means that episode 10 may actually be available somewhere out there :-) The first one to find itt seeds (?) !
