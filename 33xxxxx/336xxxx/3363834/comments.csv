,altgeeky1,2005-08-02T15:14Z,"Interesting, but is it NTSC or PAL?? I'd rather not waste the download.
Normally when people forget to document the format, I can peek inside the VIDEO_TS.IFO file, then continue or cancel the download... but I cant do that with an incomplete ISO. 
Please mention the format? Danke! :-)"

American import"
