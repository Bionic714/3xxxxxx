,TheTart,2005-07-31T22:35Z,"Try to set your Xbox options
Video output: Auto
Lock your XBOX hard drive.
You might need to upgrade to the latest version of slayer to get these options

It kept going back to the dashboard before I did this.  It might not work for you but it worked on mine"

This will let you choose between running normal or modded versions and use the correct saves for the version you are playing
first extract files to a folder open the evox.ini and modify the entry where your game is installed, Its set to f:GamesGTA San AndreasGame.xbe
If yours is somewhere else change it, Just remember the file used to launch the game is Game.xbe not default.xbe
Next transfer all the files to the root folder of the game overwrite the default.xbe, Launch game as normal, You can choose what version to play.
 All saves are safe as the modded saves are put in /E/UDATA/626a004d/ away from your normal saves, Enjoy"

Keep up the good work buddy"
,Medve,2005-08-02T19:12Z,"är det bara att föra över filer och kataloger som ligger i mappen, ""Mode Changer for....."",  till mappen på xboxen?

Och sökvägen till spelet i evox.ini som man måste ändra, är det denna rad:
DVDPlayer	= ""e:appsdvd2.0default.xbe"" ?
