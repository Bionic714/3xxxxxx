Australian Rob Tognoni is one of the finest guitar players around today. He sounds like a combination of George THorogood, AC/DC, Billy THorpe, BB KIng, Jimi Hendrix...you get the idea. By many concidered to be one of the finest guitarplayers alive today. His work is a combination of classic rock, blues, and blues/rock and is done with utmost passion and precision. What imho separates ROb from most hard bluesplayer is his gift for penning great songs, most of his songs are his own (very good) compositions. He is, of course, also a great axemaster.

He offers a A LOT of his music for download / preview on various websites. We should have more artists thinking like that, so support the dude and check out his other stuff if you like this album !
