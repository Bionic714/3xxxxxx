  Blood Omen 2, the latest installment in the Legacy of Kain Series is
  a 3rd person 3D action/combat game in which the player assumes the
  role of the vampire Kain. A compelling story drives the player
  through huge lushly detailed 3D environments and challenges their game
  play skills in combat, puzzle solving, stealth and exploration. With
  each success, the player achieves new dark powers that will grant Kain
  the ability to access treacherous new areas to explore and the power
  to face stronger, more aggressive enemies. As the player develops a
  stronger, more skilled vampire, they are rewarded with dozens of
  dazzling in-game cinematic sequences that unfold the continuing epic
  of Nosgoth, and KainÂ´s attempts to ultimately rule over it. 

  * You are the vampire Kain - the most evil figure to grace a video
    game console. 

  * Move through crowds unseen cloaked in stealth, travel stories above
    the peasant herds on which you feed leaping from roof-top to
    roof-top, and use mind-control on hapless fools to help you
    overcome vampire-proof inventions. 

  * Combat choreography unfolds with dance-like precision as Kain
    engages armies of demons and humans alike. 

  * The comprehensive menu of unstoppable attacks, nimble combos, and
    special moves will satiate even the hardened of fighting game fans. 

  * The most beautiful graphics seen on a console to date! The world
    that Kain moves through is a lushly detailed, blood-chilling gothic
    environment that is not only gorgeous to the eye, but also alive
    with the soon to be dead. 

  * With intuitive AI behavioral response, watch peasants and enemy
    characters flee, call to arms or remain unaware as Kain moves
    stealthily through crowds or charges sword raised into open areas. 

  * The combination of a dynamic action game with the dark mood and
    atmosphere make for an intense and cinematic gaming experience. 


  We tested this game on a developer XBOX, and it works.  Since there is
  no mod chip yet, we have no idea if this release will work on retail
  XBOXes when/if a mod comes out.  However, now that there is a release,
  a modchip developer will be inclined to get our releases to work, so
  we think a future mod will work with this release.

  If a game is small enough to be burned to a CD, you can burn it to 
  either a CD or DVD, at your option, using the same ISO file.  
  The Xbox does not use media checks like the PS2. 

  When burning to a CD, if your CD burning program has an option, 
  choose "MODE1/2048", exactly as if you were burning a PC CD-ROM.
  We recommend PrimoDVD for burning Xbox for both CD and DVD, but 
  all CD writing software besides Clone CD should work fine.

  From our experience, the retail Xbox can only read DVD-RW's
  and CD-RW's, so if you want to be sure that these will work
  with a future mod, we recommend burning them to Rewritable
  discs. We have heard reports of the retail Xbox reading some
  types of DVD-R discs, but we have been unable to verify this.

  This game also used the new Xbox libraries and had a media check,
  this release has been cracked and tested on a developer XBOX.
