,bruceball,2005-08-04T16:35Z,"Morphen, I guess the next claim you make is that MP3 = CD quality? Come on, get real.."
,Morphen,2005-08-04T16:44Z,"bruceball:  It's easy to understand the difference between rat and DVD for almost everybody. DVD's playable on a standard DVD-player qualifies in this category, every other crap format don't... If your rats don't fit on a CD.. It makes no difference, it isn't a DVD anyway.. "

This is not crap! It may be a revolution ;)"
