Alright here is another Leatherface show i filmed, its from 1998 and is an excellent show. This is filmed in my usual high standard and i'm sure you will all love it. You can never have too many Leatherface videos....Enjoy!

Leatherface - The Venue Edinburgh 25th March 1998 SVCD 55m

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. This will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install. http://www.videolan.org/
