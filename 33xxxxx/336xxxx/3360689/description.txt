When I first listened to this cd, I got confused. On the newest addition to the collection, Twiztid turns the style upside down to creat their first ever full Rock CD. Unlike everything else the label has been dumping on us for the last year, this cd is truly original and worth listening to.

 01: The Transformation of a New Civilization
 02: Get Off of Me

-Theres another copy of this CD out on the internet (XXL), that is such a low quality rip that its almost offensive. So before you download a CD and waist precious bandwith, remember. Only download music that you already own for backup purpouses, and Scornsoft always has the highest quality release, so fuck the rest.
