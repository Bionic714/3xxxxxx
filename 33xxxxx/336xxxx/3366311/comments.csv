,Triggersite,2005-08-06T23:17Z,Most of 'em are around 64kbps already.  6.4kbps would probably sound... bad.  If that's what you're saying I should have done ;-)
,zapbran,2005-08-06T23:41Z,"heh, i use 28 with great luck regarding sound. "
,Triggersite,2005-08-07T01:07Z,Cool!
,toratai,2005-08-08T09:47Z,"64 kbps is minimum decent sound quality, even for speech, if you want to listen through good loudspeakers or headphones."

,MimerJuri,2006-04-01T18:55Z,"Help im stuck at 99.9% and have been so for a few days. What can I do? Is this torrent dead?
Is there any way to ""artificially finish"" an almost finished torrent? (any program that can ""unpack"" the torrent).
Since it is just a bunch of mp3's, worst case scenario would be, that one of the lectures didn't work properly/entirely.

PLZ help! Im pretty new to all this."
,MimerJuri,2006-04-03T08:04Z,"Anyone know what to do when you are stuck (at 99.99%) with a file?

I have been DL this for months, and know im stuck :-(.

What can I do now, and how do I avoid getting into this situation again?"
,MimerJuri,2006-04-04T15:41Z,"Ok - I have found a chopper program that can finish it. If any of you out there experience similar problems, then find a chopper program suited to your BTclient."

,peregil,2006-05-17T13:51Z,"Great collection. I have no problems playing this on my computer. I have however big problems playing on my mp3-player (Sony NWE507). It refuses to play the original file. I am using SonicStage to convert it to another bitrate (like 256kb, or 132kb(Atrac3)). The result is terrible, way too much pitch. Sounds like the speed is too high. Anyone know of a better way of doing this?"

Will keep downloading as long as the seed holds, and I promise I will faithfully seed along the way.  This is wonderful stuff, I thank you."
,uxu000,2007-08-14T18:35Z,"Watch out - 3 people I know (including me) received DMCA violation notices from The Teaching Company thru our ISP's for sharing their stuff.
