If you're not familiar with TTC (teach12.com), they're a business that compiles college lectures from great lecturers.  Sound boring?  It actually manages not to be; they're interesting, inspiring, and actually teach you something (not bad).  One more time: they ARE interesting, I promise :)

These are my favorites.  I'd listen to them all again if I had the month.
(and if you care, my favorite was "Great Ideas in Philosophy")

So get listening!  It's never too late to expand your education (or to practice pretentious intellectual affectation <-- get it?).
