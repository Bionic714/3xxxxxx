Electrico is a big name in the local indie scene here ever since the launch of their debut album last year, and rightfully so. They sound really good, and this album proves it, everything from the catchy hooks and riffs to the top-notch production and mastering. It's a landmark album for any band in Singapore. "So Much More Inside" is an eclectic mix of melodic guitar-based post-punk rock. The themes range from being pop-rock to almost bluesy, and downtempo-ish.

<i>
Once known as Electrico Company which ended quietly in 2000, they have since been resurrected and came to be known as Electrico. Featuring a new line up of both old and new members, Electrico are frontman and guitarist David Tan, bassist Desmond Goh, drummer William Lim Jr, Ex-Livonia guitarist Daniel Sassoon and ex-Throb keyboardist, Amanda Ling, Electrico looks set to take over the world with their infectious brew of rock and roll.

Although they may be signed to a major label, Universal, the creative process and the control of the album remained in their hands because the album was created before they actually got signed. So Much More Inside is the result 9 months of sweat and hard work after hours in the recording studio and the money used to produce the album came out of their own pockets. It was produced and recorded in the Snakeweed Acoustic Labs in Singapore by highly regarded sound engineer, Leonard Soosay (Plain Sunset, Urban Xchange and Pugjelly just to name a few) at the helm, and when it was done, it was sent to the mastering genius, Stephen Marcussen in LA to put the finishing touches. . The result is a polished, meticulously produced record in which every detail has been given its fair share of attention. The quality of the production would easily match up to any Billboard chart topping cd.</i>
