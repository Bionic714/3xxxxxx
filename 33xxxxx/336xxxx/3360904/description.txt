Iron Maiden 2005 Live Ullevi

Eddie Rips Up Europe 2005
Ullevi Stadium, Gothenburg (GÃ¶teborg), Sweden 2005-07-09

Multi-cam pro-shot, broadcasted in several Nordic TV channels,
recorded from Finnish YLE/TV2

Converted to NTSC from the disc I posted few weeks ago. Unfortunately
I didn't have the raw capture anymore so some quality was lost...

Conversion method used:
PAL -> deinterlace -> slow down to 23.976fps -> encode as progressive NTSC.
Audio was also stretched (with pitch intact) and resynced by duplicating short
sections of audience noise here and there all around the show. As a result whole
show plays 4% slower than it should and there is some motion blur from the deinterlace
process. It didn't bother me, but if it bothers you, don't download it.
