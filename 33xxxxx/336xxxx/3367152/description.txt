Australian film The Monkey?s Mask is a ?lesbian-thriller? film by Samantha Lang based on a novel in poetry (!) by author Dorothy Porter. It?s about a lesbian private investigator, played by Susie Porter.

In the 80?s, actress Kelly McGillis became a kind of pin-up girl with boys when she played against Tom Cruise in the visually effective but ridiculously testosterone-bursting box-office hit Top Gun. Some twenty years later, now a mature woman, she does a more interesting role as a poetry teacher who becomes the lover of a poetry student (Porter, incidentally).

As a thriller, this film is average in quality considering the plot, but with a little unusual script by Anne Kennedy; and I know that some girls really get the hots for Susie Porter.
