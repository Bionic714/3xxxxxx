The Medici - Godfathers of the Renaissance


Information

From a small Italian community in 15th century Florence, the Medici family 

would rise to rule Europe in many ways. Using charm, patronage, skill, 

duplicity and ruthlessness, they would amass unparalleled wealth and 

unprecedented power. They would also ignite the most important cultural and 

artisitc revolution in Western history- the European Renaissance. But the 

forces of change the Medici helped unleash would one day topple their 

ordered world.

--------------------
Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired 

signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not 

fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not 

spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius 

of its scientists, the hopes of its children. This is not a way of life at 

all in any true sense. Under the clouds of war, it is humanity hanging on a 

cross of iron.

-- Dwight Eisenhower, April 16, 1953
