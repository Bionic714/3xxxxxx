Can tunglov please seed (or for that matter anyone who has a full copy). 66.2 seems to be haunting a few of us.

Help!"
,torrent-sweetie,2009-04-18T06:17Z,Sad...stuck at 66.2 like everyone else. Too bad cuz I had 12 GB seeding. This would have been a nice file to have if it had worked.
,GetSeeding,2009-04-25T08:11Z,Stuck at 66.2% with everyone else...what a let down
