Size for size, does technology out-defend nature? Does classified Chobham tank armour stack up against the ingenious body armour of a turtle? Can the milk of a genetically modified goat produce silk armour as strong as a spider? s web? Like a chameleon, soldiers of the future will blend into backgrounds, their body armour stiffening if under attack, and then relaxing to allow swift movement, relaying vital signs to a central command. Technology will give individual soldiers super defence, and will give defensive weaponry precision capabilities, but are we only now catching up with a millennia of animal defence techniques?
