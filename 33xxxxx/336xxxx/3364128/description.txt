Here it is people! My own personal Best Of Prodigy Live 1992-2005 3CD I've made lots of slight cuts to tracks (usually just a second or two) to try to get it to flow as smoothly as possible into each other (Maxim also likes to always remind us that "this will be the last one"lol). I tried to keep similar sounding recordings together as well so that you don't go from one extreme to another. And aside from a few dodgy track changes, for the most part I think you can listen to pretty smoothly given the wide range of sources. Big thanks to Rolmo for helping me cleanup some of the tracks that had a lot of hiss in them. So for some of these tracks, this will be the best recordings of them ever released!
