Free Talk Live is a Syndicated Talk Radio Show, on-air since 2002. We're not your grandfather's Talk Radio! Free Talk Live is talk radio YOU can control. We'll talk about anything from politics to personal issues. Instead of being pro-republican or pro-democrat, we're pro-FREEDOM. (Libertarian) We're on LIVE 6 days a week!. We have always given away our archives, and podcasting is a natural evolution of that.
