,freakeh,2005-08-11T00:03Z,I'm having the same problem I have Downloaded 400mb of rubbish data. Everyone seems to be stuck in the 50-60% range except one guy that shows up for 2 mins every now and again who has 99.8%.
,ozguy05,2005-08-11T02:06Z,"Guys, this movie has to be fake, no one can download it at all & it has phantom seeds, so either wait for a better tracker or avoid this like the mpaa"

,InTheDark,2005-08-11T17:32Z,Not a single seeder!  Everyone is at 61.1% is this a fake?!
,shadowuk,2005-08-11T19:26Z,"this torrent is taking the piss, spank stop fucking sayin there is seeds... get this fucking torrent sort it out "
,SimpleMinded,2005-08-13T19:56Z,The sound is very bad. I can't get this converted to AVI with sound fopr some reason. Media player downloaded a license when playing. Beware! I would just get the maven tc of this movie many more seeds as well.
,ilscuro,2005-08-15T00:03Z,"SimpleMinded don't slag this off just because you don't understand the format.

To play in media player use ffdshow codec, otherwise play it with nero showtime, simple really :->"
,bendowling,2005-08-17T10:56Z,"wtf is up with this torrent? It started fine, got to about 80% before I went to bed last night, it's been downloading all night and I come back and it's 50% done! It must have discarded a load of shit data!"
