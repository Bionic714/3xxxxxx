good session all around, apart from the tourny arrangements. the Lei / Akira player was really impressive~!

Ev2 thanks for comming down, it was nice to see some play variation, nice jacky too, i was puzzled about the K+G ~ d+K+G oki setup, seemed like i couldnt block the low sweep after blocking the high roundhouse. is it a guard break? / guaranteed hit? -- ehh weird, lol

Dat - i reeally wanted to play ur akira more, it's definatley heading toward the direction of high level. only got some with my goh using a bad stick, lol well done to win the tournie, it was only a matter of waiting till it happened, lol.

ollie - you played much better during the tourny, well done to win 3rd place, i think by then i was puking out my chocolate cake i bought, lololol.. i really felt like i didnt wanna play VF after i had eaten ^0^)

Jide - i can see some nice traps you are learning with lion, i think you are heading in the right direction with this game. remember that a even though the VF system seems like chess & numbers, the character specific tools can replace common situations like throw / knee nitaku (i.e lion's meteor punch). lion has some nice stuff to deal with disadvantage, his db+pp & b+p+K are great evasive tools, db+pp i think to low P. it's good to see these are being applied in the right situations.

rising P launcher is great for comming under highs, i think it's only +1 on normal hit, so it's why elbow lost to low P afterward, mabye a backdash mid would keep the pressure going, toy around with that situation cuz i think that could toughen lion big time in the reverse nitaku factor. but congrats on the 2nd place.

to everyone else thanks for keeping it welcome, it was good fun..
