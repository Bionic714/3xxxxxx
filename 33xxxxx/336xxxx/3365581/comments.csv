1. First of all, Murda Muzik is missing the intro.
2. Some (or all) of these albums are kazaa bullshit dupes, since some of them have mp3's of different sampling rates (128, 160, and 192kbps) in the same album.
3. The Free Agents Murder Mixtape is only 22 tracks in this torrent... I know, I know, it matches the album cover they give on the album but.... THE COVERS FOR THIS ALBUMIT ARE NOT FROM THE PROPER RELEASE! That is, the *real* retail has the 22 tracks + 19 extra tracks that are not in this torrent.
4. The last track on 'Infamous' is screwed up.

jeez... what a disgrace. when i get a chance i'll upload all of my mobb deep albums (except for the really hard-to-find stuff though ;p)"
