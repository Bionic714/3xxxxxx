Release Notes:
--------
4 additional tracks... reason enough to give you the retail. Enjoy

Featuring the excellent Love In A Trashcan, Pretty In Black is the second album
from quirky Danish duo Sune Rose Wagner and Sharin Foo. And a fine one it is
too. With a dark, Fifties/early Sixties feel to it, heavy echo effects deluge
the vocals throughout much of the production and gorgeously twangy guitars are
very much in evidence; Sleepwalking takes this noir-ish slant the furthest,
echoing Angelo Badalamenti's Twin Peaks theme with its cod-Fifties sound, while
a song like Red Tan only confirms the comparison.

It also has a sparse Velvet Underground feel to it at times too, made real by
the appearance on no fewer than five tracks of ex-Velvet - and now 60 year old -
Maureen Tucker.

There is a love of early rock'n'roll on the part of Wagner that floods through
on this record and such affection, when applied properly, works pretty well, as
on tracks like Uncertain Times and Trashcan.

The lad also likes girl-groups from the period; Ronnie Spector's guesting vocals
on The Ronettes' sounding Ode To L.A., is the icing on the cake of this highly
addictive album.
