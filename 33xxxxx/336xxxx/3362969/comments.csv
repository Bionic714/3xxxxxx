And in general, what is revisionism?  Then, if revisionism is a bad thing, as I gather it is from the way you talk about it, how do we get away from it and get to that which we want, history?  And please, offer some concrete examples and uploads that we can all access."

You'll find the same material in any serious undergraduate textbook on 20th-century Middle Eastern history, but Dr. Yaqub provides a clear, concise, and sometimes even entertaining summary of the main points."
