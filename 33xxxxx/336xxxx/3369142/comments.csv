i successfully downloaded and it plays with audio and video alright, however it is not synchronized,,
the audio is about 10 seconds before the video hits that particular point,

could anybody PLEASE explain how to fix this problem"
,maltjik,2007-06-04T22:53Z,"regarding the synch-problem. i use VLC-player and re-synced the sound delaying it 5500 milliseconds. press ctrl-s and the synching field is under ""sound"", advanced alternatives."
,Contaminator,2007-08-29T21:10Z,"yeah, it's a great movie, altough not synchonized :-(

@opiniatre: can i be so bold to ask if you could seed original dvd?"
