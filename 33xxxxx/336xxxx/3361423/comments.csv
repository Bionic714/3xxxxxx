,primie,2005-07-29T12:15Z,"hey can u plz explain the instructions more in-depth? im new to this stuff and i particularly dont understand ""mounting"" and i dont know wat program to use plz help
thank you"
,primie,2005-07-29T12:17Z,did u make this game?
,ElectroEnceFaloGraficum,2005-07-31T12:01Z,"First of all, no i didn't make this game, I just enjoy it tremendously.

Second: To mount an image means that you will use some software to make a virtual drive from the disc-image, that way telling the computer that the file on the computer is actually a seperate drive. That way you don't have to burn cd's, you just mount them. The preferred software to do this with is Daemon-tools"
,donguan,2006-01-10T21:09Z,can some one seed pls
,IndieBue,2006-01-13T21:54Z,"I've played this in distant times and I would like to do so again...But to do so, I need someone to seed. Could this happen or is this torrent forever lost?"
,Yrko91,2006-03-08T07:36Z,"Hey, I've loved this game for so long! However, I've got my lvl 40 Ninja (amongst some others) on my other computer, in demo-version (-.-).
Is there a new homepage to this game, or anything related to it? A forum perhaps? If someone see this, dont hesitate to link the homepage or whatever here, or send it to Yrko91@hotmail.com     THANK YOU"

,TaintedMustard,2007-05-02T02:28Z,"I know this is old, but can anyone seed it?"

,darkns,2008-07-26T14:47Z,"I'll download it and check if it works here, if we only could get few more seeders. ;)"
,Angloki,2008-11-09T17:25Z,"Few years ago I ordered this game - original. I have the box and ... ..  . . .  . .. .  ! .. I've lost it (someone has it borrowed).

Hope that I'll be able to succesfully dl it.
Thanks anyway - the game is tremendous! (They are working on Demise II, but they are already working on it for ages...)"
,Angloki,2008-11-10T21:54Z,"THANK YOU !!
I managed to succesfully install the game.

Seeding this thing will be my preference.. Share this beautiful game.. The only single-player RPG I know of, that is more complex, is Angband.."
[T],UberMetaller,2008-11-11T23:13Z,"Nice upload. It works wonderfully, and is fun to play."
,efau,2009-07-31T13:00Z,anyone know ho to make it run in english?
,jdl2520,2010-06-07T21:10Z,"Just had the same error posted above (various files failed to self-register on the install), and I am on Windows 7...just got the game working, here's what I did...I'm not incredibly tech savvy so bear with me, and some steps are likely unnecessary because of this:

1. Right clicked on the installer, located on the CD drive, then went to compatibility and changed it to Windows 98/ME, and activated admin mode
2. Did the same on the autorun program
3. Installer ran visibly differently and the error didn't happen...Program still wouldn't run after patch and file copies, so:
4. Changed compatibility of Demise.exe and Demiserc.exe to Windows 2k and chose D3D as my renderer and it worked

This was after a good half hour of trial and error... hopefully this works on your systems, and someone more knowledgeable than I can write up a better way to go about this.

Good luck, this was a bitch to get running on newer computers."
,bulletboy17,2011-09-06T19:18Z,does anyone run a server for this still?
