MobyGames Description:
----------------------
You are Rodrigo. Rodrigo is a hero. You think that?s cool? Not in this game!

You live at the isle Tol Andar and there lives very very much other heroes. The problem is, that there are not so much princesses or dragons for all heroes. At this time Rodrigo is unemployed. Another problem are the pirates. These guys want to raid the city Smashville. With the magical gloomstones they want to create flying ships. Confronted with this situation Rodrigo is very discontented.

Just right in time the dwarf Ramil hires Rodrigo to find his wife Jasmin. Jasmin was captured from the pirates and was held in the city of Endavin. This is the beginning of a great story?.

Rent-a-hero is a typical point and click adventure. The characters are modeled in 3D but the background graphics are traditional 2D.

Game Information:
-----------------
This is not the Sega game "Rent a Hero No. 1".

I got the ZIP and RAR from the eDonkey P2P Network. CD1 is in CloneCD Format in a ZIP and CD2 is in NRG format in a RAR. CD2 had "Spanishare.com" in the filename before I got rid of it.

Installation
------------
  Installation went smoothly. If you get any problems, please post your problem at AGC (it will be easier for me to see it). There is a chance you may need Compatibility Mode; Window 95 might be the mode. One way to do Compatibility Mode is to right-click on the EXE, click on the "Compatibility"
tab, tick the box in the "Compatibility Mode", choose which mode you want (in this case it's Windows 95), click OK, and you're done. Just run the EXE.

Playing the Game
----------------
  The Options are in the EXE on CD1. Quit game pops-up a "Are you sure you want to quit?", it's hard to see. A standard click where yes/no should be will do or pushing "Y" or "N" on your keyboard.

I have not found a No-CD crack for this game. And you need both CDs to play. After first playing the game with CD1, you will switch to CD2 very shortly. So if you plan on playing the game by mounting with a Virtual CD Drive, extract both CDs and switch CDs when needed.
