,pumkinjack,2005-07-31T21:58Z,"Radion , malicious script my ass. i reckon its time to upgrade from windows 3.1 for networks. The file is as clean as a whistle and does not crash shit. I thought intelligent people watched rugby.... At least people who knows how to type on a keyboard. Its called the i.n.t.e.r.n.e.t. Jabbersteve please dont mind technological virgins such as Radius, please be so kind as to upload the trinations.... thanks"

I have now fixed the problem. But isn't it fun when people try impress others over the I.N.T.E.R.N.E.T. with useless babble. Thanks jabbersteve for this game. Anymore games would be shit hot. radneo with a N."
