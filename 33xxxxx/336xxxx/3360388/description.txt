       Plot Summary

       A mischevious Sara and Felix sneak into grumpy old Alexander Abraham's 
       house, on a dare, not knowing that he is ill and about to be quarantined. 

       Avonlea busy-body, Rachel Lynde enters his house looking for his farm boy 
       who has been skipping her Sunday School Class.

       All are quarantined together. Alexander is a woman hater, Rachel a 'do-
       gooder', and the house is an unmitigated mess. Rachel nurses Alexander 
       through his illness, Felix too, when he falls ill. Sara helps cleans his 
       house, and learns that there is more to life than just reading books all 
       the time. 

       Through the help of the children and Rachel Lynde, Alexander is no-longer a 
       cranky old man, and somewhat less of a woman-hater. Mrs. Rachel, however, 
       remains a 'do-gooder'.
