,Tcip,2005-08-11T08:58Z,"This person is not seeding.. If you want XBMC, download it from: GasGiver4711."
,GasGiver4711,2005-08-11T14:06Z,"@all: don´t forget to put in_mp3.dll in systemplayerspaplayer ;-)   -   otherwise mp3s are played with mplayer and not with paplayer as it should be  -  do not use the one from the very latest winamp, it won´t work  -  the in_mp3.dll should have exactly 508.928 bytes  -  Regards, GasGiver"
