This completely updated version of the Frontline 1999 documentary Hunting bin Laden is a reporting collaboration with The New York Times. It features a new introduction by journalist Bill Moyers, who discusses the tragic terrorist attacks that took place on September 11, 2001. 
In Search of bin Laden provides background and insight into bin Laden's life and motives, from his formative experience in the Afghan jihad against the Soviets, to the 1998 bombings of two United States embassies in Africa and his statements and fatwahs calling for the murder of Americans. This updated version features current information on bin Laden's believed role in the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, an interview with Times reporter Judith Miller, and a new interview with former State Department counterterrorism official Larry Johnson.
