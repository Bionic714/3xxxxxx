SOUND : BOSSA MANILA
Sound's Debut Album (Phils, 2003)


Listening to bossaManila (Sound), you?d get the sense that they?re influenced in equal parts by The Beatles, Rivermaya and early Jamiroquai. Musical pathologists would find gene splices of the Eraserheads, Brand New Heavies, Sergio Mendes and Jamiroquai?s Return of the Space Cowboy CD in their DNA. ~The Manila Times

A wholly independent work, bossaManila is a chronicle of Manila life. It is rife with sentiment, hope, and sorrow. Musically, the groove is ever-present, technically meticulous but raw. From cosmic kismets to generational ties, bossaManila is a Filipino worldview, aiming for global standards in a localized market, where "indie" is a viable alternative, and not a genre. ~Sound.ph
