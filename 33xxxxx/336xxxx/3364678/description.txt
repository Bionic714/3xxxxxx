Fantastic mega-rare Spanish heavy psych/rock album from 1971. Trippy effects, spacey guitars, funky bass and dreamy keyboards dominate what is essentially a funky blues based rock album in a similar vein to Cream/Hendrix etc. Stunning heavy psychedelic rock with a monstrous wah wah fuzz guitar and mixed with some of the most psychotic spaced out sound effects ever and all vocals in English It was recorded in Barcelona in 1971 in the same studios as Pan Y Regaliz. The album was released as a local pressing with a few hundred copy's only. The 2nd CD has an unheard version of the album and various outtakes.Easily one of the best Spanish psych albums.
