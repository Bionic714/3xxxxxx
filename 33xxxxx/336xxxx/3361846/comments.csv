This may allow you to get the sound. http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ac3filter/ac3filter_0_70b.exe?download"

,Katala,2006-02-03T01:30Z,"Any audio or video problems can be solved with a simple free program called ""AVIcodec"".
Just type it's name in google or whatever.

It tell's you what codecs the movie uses and if it's supported or unsupported by your software codecs. If unsupported, it will provide a link to download the necessary codec.

Thank you for seeding this great movie btw. ;)"

It's one install and you basically don't have to worry about codecs ever, until a newer version of the pack comes out.
