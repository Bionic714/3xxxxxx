,beater,2007-01-09T23:27Z,"Install Camel, and open folder where it installed.
example; C:\Programs\Steinberg\VST instruments\Camel Audio Cameleon 5000 v1.2\PARADOX

There is info file.
Open it, and there you go."

what do I do?"
,chungwa,2008-11-05T01:53Z,"I don't get it. Brilliant synth?? Tinny and fairly uninspiring sound, drowned in internal fx to make up for poor oscillator modelling. Am I missing something? "

,mudbone32,2011-06-04T16:30Z,getting very strange results when trying to install this...AVG says it's a known trojan and my screen resolution jumps so that I can hardly see anything on the screen. will have to try another release...
,BK.BROWN,2011-08-16T07:43Z,"Works, just use notepad to open the nfo after installing"
