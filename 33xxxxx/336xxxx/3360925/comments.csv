,SS_dominator,2005-07-26T00:54Z,"Ok.. i´ve digged up some information. If you have no problems installing the game all you need to do is to download the 1.06 uk release path at http://www.volition-inc.com/fs/downloads.cfm

If you have problems with installing it go to this adress: http://www.techzonez.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-12955.html  to find some tips on how to do.

If you have any other solutions or problems please post them here and hopefully we can solve them together. "
,avatar1969,2005-07-26T01:08Z,no problems under windows xp if u do the following: copy the files autoexec.nt and config.nt from your windowsrepair directory to windowssystem32.... then use the compatability mode from windows in the properties section on the set up file...there smile ;)
,SS_dominator,2005-07-26T01:43Z,"Yes i read that to somewere, and tried it but it didn´t work for me. Ithink it depends on xp version and system configurations. Thats why i wanted to collect different solutions so we all end up with a working game. So keep on posting different ways to get it to work. Becuse this is an awesome game that everybody should try. 

Thanks in advance"

,homeworld,2005-07-30T01:46Z,"it works just fine with the uk patch, thanks SS_dominator!"
,homeworld,2005-07-30T01:48Z,and for next time I suggest converting the images to .iso format with a utility like UltraISO. these 3 images take up 250MB less space in iso format. 
,homeworld,2005-07-30T01:54Z,"finaly, don't run the exe included on the silent threat cd in extras directory, it's a trojan. the game install itself is fine though."
