   Description:

    For the first time ever in a Worms game, wriggling 
    commanders can design and build their own incendiary 
    devices thanks to the genius Weapons Factory.

    How satisfying it is to unleash a weapon of your own
    creation รป from the downright vicious to the comical
    on your opponents.

    So what's to stop players from creating something 
    all-powerful? Well, that's the clever bit: each 
    weapon element costs points. If you choose a feature 
    like Homing, then there are less points to spend on 
    damage. Simple!

    Grenades, projectiles, air strikes, and guns are all 
    in there and there are plenty of comedy components 
    for you engineer weapons with too, including monkeys, 
    buckets of sick, hamsters, and a ton weight for that 
    classic drop-n-splat tactic!

    Once devised, just name and save your weapon and select
    it as the special weapon for your team to use in the 
    game. Why not save it to your memory card and 
    demonstrate it on a friend?

    Of course, you don't have to do all the work. The evil 
    geniuses at developer Team 17 have already packed 
    Worms 4: Mayhem full of classic weapons along with a 
    load of new and inventive ways to eliminate your enemy 
    annelids.
