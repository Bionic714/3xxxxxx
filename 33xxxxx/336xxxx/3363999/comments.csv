,Dorkster,2005-08-13T05:51Z,"This is really great stuff. If there is anything to put my finger on is that it would be really great if it was ripped in 192 kbps instead of 128 kbps. Still, very good, keep up the good work TranzXmaN :-)"
,Dorkster,2005-08-13T06:00Z,"C'est substance vraiment grande. S'il y a quelque chose mettre mon doigt est allumé qu'il serait vraiment grand s'il était déchiré dans 192 kbps au lieu de 128 kbps. Toujours, très bon, maintenez le bon travail TranzXmaN : -)"

,matrixx740,2008-03-03T23:08Z,"I'm sorry, but you're an idiot.
- It should be in FLAC or in highest bitrate mp3 (above 256 Kbps)
- Tags are rubish (or nothing)
- In filenames and directory hierarchy there are NOT structure (or each album has different one)

But, of course, I thank you for good music"
