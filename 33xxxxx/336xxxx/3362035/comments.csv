,robbkm3,2005-07-28T05:40Z,".Hi, I have a question. For some reason it says my torrent is 99.9% done and is uploading fine. Why is it saying that? Is this normal? Or do I need to re seed the torrent? The reason i was asking is i don't want to  other people to download from me and ends up with an incomplete download."
