About the bin and cue files.....you have to mount those with deamon tools.

The crack didn't work for me, but just get the latest crack and patch at gamecopyworld or gamespot and start playing!"

,stationmiek,2006-09-23T12:20Z,"Mount the bin file with Alcohol 120% and open it as a CD (It should be in My Computer as a drive), or it'll probably autoplay. There should be a crack folder in there (hence 'virtual' drive)"
