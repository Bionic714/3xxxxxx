,Endyowitch,2005-08-03T03:41Z,"Use together with Fast Loader, a ISO launcher for Playstation Portable.

Probably only works with firmware 1.50 like all other stuff ... good for me I got one of those ^^"

""Ladies and gents, I now have Dynasty Warriors USA working 100% with Fast Loader... as I suspected it was a bad rip. The solution was taking the boot.bin and eboot from the JAP version (I also add koeiinfo.pmf) and attaching it to the US one then recompiling the iso. Just did it myself."""
,Duce0191,2005-08-04T22:13Z,"If anyone has the boot.bin, the eboot, and the koei.pmf of the JAP version of dynasty warriors please upload it (i am unable to download the dynasty warriors jap version because i can't register to that website)   thanks in advance"
