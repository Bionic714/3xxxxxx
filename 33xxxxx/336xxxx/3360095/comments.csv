,pkrisnin,2005-07-27T14:11Z,"I'm unable to open this movie even with Quicktime. Anybody with the same problem. If this is one of those corrupted files that the MPAA is putting out there, then you are pissing me off. 
Oh well I'll just download another and make multiple copies for my friends just to piss the MPAA off."
,pkrisnin,2005-07-27T15:03Z,"Wingchuner thanks for you effort for uploadingthis movie.

ok update on this movie only quicktime 7 (not quicktime 6.5) can play this file but you'll only get to view half  a screen .  To view fullscreen you need to upgrade to PRO 7 version.
Yes that's right you have to pay.  Well screw that I'm not downloading any more MP4."
,wingchuner,2005-07-28T01:36Z,"Ok first of all its not a corrupt file...jesus you paranoid people...second of all try vlc player/mplayer/quicktime before asking what player do i use? there are also serials for quicktime so you really don't have to pay for them, besides if your downloading a movie from here, i doubt your paying for a lot of software  now n days"
