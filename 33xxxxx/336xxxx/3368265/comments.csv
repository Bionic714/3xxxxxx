,Sith1ord,2005-08-11T07:10Z,these command lines work on os x?
,malevolent,2005-08-11T12:36Z,"Mac OS X has the linux kernel and graphical Interface (X.org i guess), hence it should work"
[T],DasBot,2005-08-11T12:57Z,Mac OS X does not have a Linux kernel! Its Darwin kernel is based on FreeBSD and Mach technologies.
,Petter73,2005-08-11T18:19Z,"Will it work on x86_64...?! Really hope so, for after I ditched 32bit and went 64, I've been screwed wrt. matlab... Works without graphics, but what fun is that?! Oh, well... We'll see..."
,Petter73,2005-08-12T09:08Z,"No glnxa64 there, unfortunately... Does the 64bit version of Matlab come in a package of it's own?"
,unitel,2006-03-10T20:40Z,Which toolboxes are included? And how is the problem with the license manager solved?
,me_himself,2006-05-23T18:30Z,CD2 and CD3 content ureadable data (e.g. chinese (?) file names). Has someone else this problem? Is it reasoned by fault cdrecord(k3b)?
,me_himself,2006-05-23T19:30Z,"It works well with mount -o loop .iso /mnt/

License Manager"
,gugamare,2006-08-19T01:50Z,Does any one have just the license file for this torrent?
,michaeka,2006-09-30T11:50Z,The license.lic file does not contain your_host_name as stated in readme_lic.txt. Why? Could anyone give a extremely detailed explanations on how to use the included license files?
,MrTelemark,2006-10-03T16:14Z,"Thanks! Installation is not trivial on Mac OS X. Eventually though... However, I cannot get any of the toolboxes to load.

Matlab will start fine without the license manager, but without toolboxes. A few times I've gotten the lm to start (using ./lmstart -c license.dat) but it hasn't really helped. Any ideas on how to get the toolboxes working?"
,james957,2006-10-04T09:29Z,"Basic Matlab works fine, but the toolboxes don't work.  I have to run:
$  sh /usr/local/matlab7/etc/lmstart
$  matlab

and the toolboxes will load, but they will crash when you try to actually use them.

Any suggestions?  license problems perhaps?

thanks"
,MrTelemark,2006-10-05T10:55Z,"Thanks!
However, I had a hard time installing this on my mac (PB15), after much ado I got it working, but without the toolboxes... Perhaps it's easier on linux, perhaps it's just me? I would suggest downloading a more recent version, say R14sp2, which installs very smoothly, including toolboxes and all."
,xthepoet,2006-11-10T06:16Z,"I'm trying to install it on FC4 and am getting a weird error:
Setup aborted..
The installer cannot be run when your current directory is on the CD. Change to the target MATLAB installation directory and rerun the installer.

The steps I took were:
1) copied the 3 .iso files to the computer, mkdir the /usr/local/matlab7/, copied license.dat to it
2) did: mount -o loop -t iso9660 disk1.iso /mnt/iso/
3) tried variations of install, ./install, sh install* &
and got that error message
4) did: install * /usr/local/matlab7 to copy over the files with changed permissions -rwxr-xr-x  (it for some reason didn't do the directories, so I copied those manually and chmod it)
5) in /usr/local/matlab7/ I tried to run variations of ./install, sh install* &  but still got the same error as above.

Any ideas? I'd really appreciate some help."
,anuragsobti,2006-11-27T08:21Z,"Hey ! I accidently deleted the license.lic file. Could anyone supply me that please....I could have got it from the original .zip file that I downloaded from another website but I don't have that 1.11 GB file because I deleted that as well because my disk space is limited....I have MATLAB 7.0 for Mac OS X.....

Thanks a lot in advance for the file and your time !"

for step 3), just to to /usr/local/matlab7 without copying any files to it except the license.dat, then use (for ubuntu 10.04)

it works for me"

i have downloaded this and i have a question:
do i have to write the 3 images on cd? cant i use ""mounter"" programs?
i have ubuntu lucid(10.04) if it helps
thx "

it says :

The TMW_Archive INCREMENT line in /home/vahid/matlab/etc/etc/license.dat license file is incorrect.
Please make sure the TMW_Archive INCREMENT line is complete and accurate.

so whats the problem?"

i had the same problem but unfortunately nobody helped :(

good news is i found out this one works with R14 under unix:

download it and put it under etc/ folder inside the main Matlab folder. it works!"
