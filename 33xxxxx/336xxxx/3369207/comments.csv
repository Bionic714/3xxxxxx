The google translator, translated info text to :
A prehistoric adventure of exploration and intrigues.  In the adventure we will take the paper from a young person of the paleolítico that will try to complete its artistic restlessness, company that will take to him until the cave of Lascaux.  This title, developed by Kheops Studio and produced by The Adventure Company, counts on a clear priority on the part of its developers towards the historical rigor within the adventure, that, we remember, will be framed in the dawn of the human species.  An exploration adventure and intrigues in that you will have to solve puzzles and mysteries besides to use your dowries of observation to survive.  The title is carried out by the homínido Arok, with which we will have to fish, to hunt, and to surpass the test of initiation of the clan of the Shamanist:  to find the Cavern Lost that it gives name to the game."

,hynatron,2005-08-16T16:23Z,"i have the same problem as §yssh@d has mentioned earlier here. This is for everyone I think. The crack is probably not working correctly. I have checked some other sites for working ones, but no result yet. "
