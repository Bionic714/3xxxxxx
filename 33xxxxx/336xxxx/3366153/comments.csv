,bgibson8708,2005-08-08T04:33Z,how do u degrade your bios to a lower version?
,bgduece,2005-08-08T09:26Z,"A lot of people are having problems with this game...like me...when you try to start the game it freezes....for some people they are not having problems, and the game plays fine...but if I was the only one having problems, I might agree that I was a dumb ass, but it is not only me, and we all have the same problem...has any one come up with a resolution. I can not get this game to play off the DVD or the Hard drive"
,plakskull,2005-08-08T14:06Z,"This sounds like the same problem people were having running Forza Motorsport.  People complained that the ISO was fake and it really was not.  I had the problem where it wouldn't load also, but after much effort, I figured out what was wrong.

Give this a shot: Try updating your MS Dashboard.  Apparantly, some games will not run unless they have a particular level of MS dashboard in place (even if you're not booting through the normal process).

Use a file manager to browse the content of the ISO and check if there's a dashboard update on board.  If so, launch that updater from Avalaunch or something and it may fix the problem.  That was what solved the problem for me with Forza."
,twojeeze,2005-08-09T03:05Z,"Fortunately, this game is working fine for me, although when I was putting it on my hard drive with dvd2xbox, it said 1 file failed to copy.  I have played a couple quick games against the CPU, and everything was fine.  I dont know what that file was exactly, but I havent noticed any problems, and mine plays fine off the HD, or the disk."
,urxgrlfriend,2005-08-09T23:00Z,"Please, someone, upload this for PC!!  I will seed until 2007 comes out, I swear to GOD!  lol!"
,telly_79,2005-08-11T19:00Z,anyone know where i could get an update for the rosters?
,gaslampa,2005-08-12T13:56Z,"Hello!

I only have 5% left now for the game. And I wounder. When Im going to burn it to a DVD is it just to burn like a dataCD? and should I use DVD-R?

All of you must excuse me but Im really new to this;-)

,TheNorthPole,2005-08-12T14:40Z,"Why is it, when i unpack it once, that I get a 3,5 giga zip file again? The guy who cracked the game didn't leave any instructions for the burning of the game?

Can anybody help me? Should I just burn the zip file?

If anybody was wondering, its my first time downloading a Xbox game ;)"
,tussii,2005-08-12T18:02Z,"u dont get another ""zip"" file. u get an .iso file.. burn it or extract it to the xbox harddrive with  xfer"
,bgduece,2005-08-12T19:13Z,"We Have A fix... Microsoft has a update to their dashboard, that has to be updated for burned Madden 2006 to run. Just put a recently purchased or rented game (legit) and boot the retail BIOS. that will update the MS Dashboard, and then your burned game will work fine, on the DVD or the Hard drive."
