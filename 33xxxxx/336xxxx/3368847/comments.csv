,SiJoSt,2005-08-13T07:02Z,"donki, YOU are a fucking looser. green day have sold over 10 mil records. and they have won every price they can. so fuck you and go to bed!"
,jugglermk,2005-08-13T08:51Z,"Sorry about the wait but it is now moving fine. Oh and to donki 130,000 people can't be wrong can it I was there and it was totally awsome"
,SiJoSt,2005-08-13T19:33Z,"jugglermk, you lucky bastard :D

i love green day, and i watched them live once, best live-band ever! "
,DocNorton,2005-08-14T23:06Z,"Donki,

You got it in one - Green Day are a band for ""losers"", ""losers"" like myself, not the moral majority - If it was so crap 130,000 people wouldn't have turned up, BBC wouldn't cover it and Kerrang wouldn't have voted it the greatest live gig in history beating the likes of AC-DC in '83 and all the other greats.

They also wouldn't be in the running for greatest rock band on the planet by Kerrang.

So shut it you fucking n00b else St. Jimmy will twat the living shit outta ya !

Thanks for the torrent Juggler, I was there on Sunday - IT WAS AWESOME."
,St. Jimmy,2005-08-18T03:12Z,"donki is fucking crap. I'm surprised and shocked that anyone listens to him. Green Day is the best band....ever (even better than the Ramones). I saw them at the Quart festival In Norway July 5. and it fuckin' rocked. Oh, and Doc, if i ever meet donki I will beat the shit out of him :-)"
,sahand10,2006-05-09T20:40Z,"Yeah, you fucking suck donki. Green day rocks! If they would suck, they wouldn't have got their grammy for the best rock album, and they wouldn't have 130, 000 people watching them in England!"
,katatonu,2006-12-14T00:39Z,greatest band ever? ha ha
