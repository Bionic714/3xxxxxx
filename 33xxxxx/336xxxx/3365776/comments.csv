I have succeded downloading, and have burned the ISO file on a DVD, but nothing is happening on the playstation.
Have I done something wrong??"
,dnasty,2005-08-09T15:52Z,You need a modified PS2 to play backups (non-originals).  Google swap magic + flip top.

,itzyaboi_corbo,2005-08-09T20:35Z,can i use an emulator on the computer to play instead of writing everything to the dvd

,tagltd,2005-08-16T16:42Z,FYI -  i know that this is an elite release however I wanted to warn all of the low quality from SOLOPS2.COM....games stutter or do not work at all on modded console. Other sources are fine for almost all titles. Be forewarned!
