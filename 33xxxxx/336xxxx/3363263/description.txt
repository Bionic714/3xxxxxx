Kemi-Tornio FULL MILE TOP SPEED 2005 Happening 
Date: 30.8.
Filmed by amateur (me) and with handcam, so you can´t expect much ;)

Few V8 cars, about 20-30 GT cars, and 40 sport bikes driving one after another a mile, and point is to get best top speed.

Best bike was turbo Suzuki with 310km/h,
Best gt was Mitsubishi Galant Turbo 4x4 with 248km/h,
Corvette was the best V8, but I think all those V8´s were at quite stock setups (so dont´t expect monster V8´s).
