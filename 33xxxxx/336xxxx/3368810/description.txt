Charlie Norman - Boogie Woogie

Charlie Norman, the Swedish entertainer and pianist, is for me, first and foremost a truly great Boogie Woogie pianist. He has got that special elastic left hand-feeling, so hard to achive! Here you will find a collection of Boogie Woogie played by Norman.

A few remarks on some of the tracks:
Anitra's Dance Boogie Woogie (from 1949) is a Boogie Woogie on Grieg's Anitra's Dance. Rumours say this tune was censored and forbidden in Norway for a number of years. It was considered very inappropriate at that time to do a Boogie Woogie on the classical piece Anitra's Dance.

Boogie 68, Media Lux and Let's Go are three hard driving, light swinging Boogie Woogies in Norman style.

Charlie Norman died 12-Aug-2005.

Rest in Peace, Charlie. We all miss You.
