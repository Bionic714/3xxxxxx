Review:

The June 16, 2000, concert in Katowice, Poland, is one of the best and most unique in Pearl Jam's series of official bootlegs documenting nearly all of the band's concerts in 2000. The band was originally scheduled to play in Budapest this night, but instead played a second night in Poland. Only about 3,000 fans showed up to the show, causing the band to play a very intimate and spontaneous show. In an unusual move, the concert starts with four mellow songs in a row before building up to a rocking climax and then winding back down again during an eight-song encore. There is great interaction between the band and the small crowd throughout the night, and the 30-song set list is filled with less frequently played songs in the band's catalog, and all the performances are clean and tight. A special and memorable night recognized by the band and fans alike as one of the best of the year. ~ Steven Jacobetz, All Music Guide
