This video demonstrates why the practice of Tai Chi will make your groin area appear to be bigger. The genitals do NOT get any bigger. They only look that way from the outside when people look at your pants. It takes at least 3 years for this effect to begin to be noticeable. You should find yourself becoming more popular as your groin area appears to grow in size.
