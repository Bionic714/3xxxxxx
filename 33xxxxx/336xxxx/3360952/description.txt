"Nu, pogodi" (or "Wait, I'll get you!" is a cartoon series from Russia. Not
to be confused with the German band bearing the same name.

Here's what the "Big Cartoon database" has to say about it: 

"Originally started as a "Tom and Jerry" wannabe, the series 
evolved into a completely different phenomenon. The chases, 
spills and cartoon character mangling are still there- 
but the series are also a poignant social satire. The Wolf 
is a chain-smoking motorcycle-riding beer-guzzling proletarian. 
The Rabbit has all the childish innocence and enthusiasm of 
properly raised Soviet youth - and yet displays odd homoerotic 
tendencies that were obviously missed by the government censors.

There is almost no dialogue, so it remains understandable by people 
who speak no Russian, although non-Russians are unlikely to get the 
"easter egg gags" hidden in the soundtrack and obscure pop-culture 
references which are plentiful.

The soundtrack is a medley of pop tunes, each providing a 
commentary on the action and (to a person knowledgeable in '70s 
Soviet pop-music) is often funnier then the action. The few 
original pieces written for the show were performed by (at the time) 
the only Electronic Instruments Orchestra in Russia (featuring weird 
analog synthesizers, theremins and other interesting devices)."

After Anatoli Papanov's death, his voice was sampled and used in later series.

The full series has been released on VHS and VCD and is available in 
many stores that carry Eastern European books and videos.
