    Game Notes:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~
    You are the leader of a glorious dynasty. Amass prestige and piety
    and the world will whisper your name in awe. Increase the greatness
    of your lands and your treasure coffins, build Cathedrals and
    Castles, and combat Highway Robber Bands and defecting vassals.
    Introduce laws and set taxes, interact with hundreds of countiers and
    nobles. Historical multiple-choice events will spawn from the actions
    of your monarch.
    Can you organize defence at home while mustering a great army?
    Will you concert other monarchs, and the Pope, under your
    leadership to liberate the Holy Land? Do you have what it takes to
    become a Crusader King?
