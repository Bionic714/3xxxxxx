Not sure what's different until I see it.  If you read up on it, let me know, haha, would help me out."
,Burning Red Ivanhoe,2005-08-15T14:58Z,"a little disappointing to begin with, but:


The only question is, do you get the film?s ?Extreme Unrated DVD? or its original R-rated theatrical cut?

In truth, it hardly matters ? just as it didn?t for The Girl Next Door and Eurotrip. Like Harold and Kumar, each came to DVD in R-rated as well as unrated versions, with the latter suggesting more raw and revealing material. Yet in each case, it was tough to tell the difference.

The fact is, Mary Poppins would be ?unrated? if Disney added several more seconds of kids flying kites and didn?t resubmit the altered film for a new ratings review. ?Unrated? doesn?t mean the equivalent of an NC-17. It just means unrated.

In Harold and Kumar?s case, it means a bit of incidental footage was added to a film already riddled with sex and vulgarities. 

More enticing are the unrated edition?s unique bonus features. These include another commentary track, a music video and more outtakes.  "
,Burning Red Ivanhoe,2005-08-15T15:00Z,the commentary sounds especially entertaining! 
[T],sickboy88,2005-08-16T01:25Z,"I can pack the commentary as a second track if I force mono on it, without fucking up the picture quality, I'll do that when I get it.

I disagree about the ""unrated"" thing...what you said is almost ALWAYS true, however there are movies like the ""toxic avenger 1"" ""terror firmer"" and ""spun"" where there is night and day difference between R and Unrated.

I can't say Harold and Kumar isn't going to be that much different until I see it."
