A request for "Burning Red Ivanhoe" here is your movie.  I went through 4 different releases, and could NOT find a widescreen release.  I am starting to think that it only came out in fullscreen, but I seem to remember seeing it in widescreen.  Wish I could have done better, but if fullscreen doesn't bother you, then here it is...this one came out very good.

Optional external ENGLISH subs in VOBsub format.

Mini Plot:

Anton would like very much to go about his daily routine of smoking weed, watching TV, and lusting after the girl across the street. The only thing stopping him is his demon-possessed right hand which seems determined to kill anyone it encounters. After dropping his parents and his best friends, the hand sets its sights on Molly, the punk rock girl of Anton's affection. Luckily for him, Pnub and Mick (his recently deceased buds) are back from below ground to help the problem get solved. Only they better get cracking because the hand is out for more than just a killing spree. If it gets its fingers on Molly before midnight on prom night, her soul is hell-bound.
