,itsfuckingme99,2008-04-04T04:23Z,dont suppose anyone knows if you can play this on the pc or is it a case of sticking it on disc and playing it on a chipped xbox?
,inoksvere,2011-07-21T09:17Z,I'm curious about that a well. Think I could just burn it to play on my 360 (with the optional media update) without it being modded?
