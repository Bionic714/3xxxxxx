,ludde_L,2005-08-12T00:49Z,somebody please seed
,Metonomy,2005-08-14T17:35Z,hanzgroove: I mount the file with Alcohol 120 and then play it with WinDVD. No problem at all. High quality. Thanks for uploading this!
,samhain959,2005-08-15T00:57Z,i'd like to see some of you fat computer nerds doing tai chi.... that'd be hilarious.
,hanzgroove,2005-08-15T19:05Z,Glad you liked it Metonomy. I'll see what else I can upload for you guys.
,Cstodg,2006-02-05T07:56Z,I downloaded this and it is all messed up.  There is some kind of video feed flaw with it.  It plays on computer but it has some annoying flickering to it.  It was a poor RIP.  Anyone else find this?
,MACinized,2008-02-02T02:06Z,tnx for the share hanzgroove. downloading/seeding it now but hopefully there'd be more seeders.

Bring it, samhain959.  I'll show you what an eight sided cage is for.  But a back alley serves even better.  

Keep you ignorant comments to yourself, asshole.  Some of us computer nerds have six packs.  And even if we don't, have you ever heard of identity theft?..."
,pbta2,2008-11-09T01:27Z,firstly thanks for upload and secondly a note to samhain959 your name is wrong! how someone could use a pagan name and set about harming via ridicule I dont know?? do as you will and harm none is the pagan way of the ancients! you are stepping on far to many toes for your own good I myself being an ex l*e s*a* kung fu student found tai chi the only way to keep my martial art going I am disabled due to a bad motorcycle crash I hope you either change the name or respect it.
,piratloler,2008-12-26T21:12Z,"Having the same problem as Cstodg. Plays fine on computer, skips on the DVD player."
,dank2000,2009-05-07T14:41Z,"As a military man I am enjoying this dl it helps to keep me focused and in shape to do my job in the military, oh and by the by i pilot a UAV samhain and there is no hiding from me."

,ThunderDragonX,2010-02-27T16:17Z,"I am downloading this now to check it out. Did some Googlin' and this video is supposed to be simple enough for beginners with some history stuff in it. 

Trying to recover from arm surgery and I need to get my flexibility and muscle strength back slowly but surely. Thanks for sharing this with us here at TPB."
,thorn101,2011-02-25T17:19Z,"Can't play this.
VLC crashes when I select the iso image or the VIDEO_TS directory directly and DVD player on Mac OS X won't go any further then the FBI warning.

What gives?"
,candymanmessiah,2011-06-26T11:24Z,"I am experiencing the same problem as piratloler and Cstodg - All video has an annoying flicker to it, (when played back on the PC via Daemon) which actually makes the DVD difficult to watch (even starts to make me feel ill after a time). Burning to a DVD failed (but it could be my writer)."
