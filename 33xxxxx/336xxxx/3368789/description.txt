As the title says, this is a seminary that took place in Ostrava in 2002 with Gaku Homma.  Everything thing Homma-sensei says is translated in Czech and though he is supposed to be talking in English, I didn't understand a word (even the translator had difficulties and sometimes Homma-sensei's assistant had to intervene.  I guess they couldn't find a Japanese translator).  But don't worry, you'll understand what he does if you're already an aikidoka.  If you're not, download one of the introductory videos, go practice in an Aikido dojo a couple of months (this is NOT optional) and come back.

The video itself contains primarily jo kata and kaeshi waza (techniques you can use in response to incorrectly applied techniques).
