MY FAIR MELODIES : the INDIGO
the Indigo's Covers Collection (Japan, 2002)


My Fair Melodies is the Indigo's first set of covers CD. Where they made their own renditions of songs by Carole King, Burt Bacharach, Suzanne Vega and many more. Composed of ten (10) covers from sixteen (16) well-known artists, these songs will surely be familiar to you.

Although Miki's english doesn't sound perfect, her singing voice was as always, beautiful. My favorites were "I Feel The Earth Move", "My Cherrie Amour" and "Luka."

If you like smooth jazz or early swing/mellow m­usic, and don't mind listening to fresh renditions, then try My Fair Melodies. I enjoyed it, and hope some of you will enjoy this as well.
