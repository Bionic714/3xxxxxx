  Crimson Sea takes place in the vast system of Theophilus. Players set
  off on the journey of a lifetime, battling strange creatures in order
  to uncover the truth and realize their destiny. You play as Sho, a
  brave young man with a clouded past, and join him as he gathers a
  group of highly individualistic teammates to battle strange enemies 
  in a number of unique missions.

  NOTE: Seems WAM's release wasn't able to be unrarred as they were missing
  a file.  We waited over an hour for a fix however it never came so here
  is the fully unrarrable version :)
