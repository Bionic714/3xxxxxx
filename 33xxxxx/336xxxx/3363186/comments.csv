,karotechia,2005-08-04T22:31Z,"Anyone still stuck at 99.9% : Stop this torrent. Go to http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3365367 like DeltaTeam instructs.  Download the new torrent file that was posted.  If necessary, redirect your torrent client to the files you have already DL, and it will run a file check (this can take a few minutes for 7.48GB). You will soon have 100% of MONSTERS OF DEATH!  Thanks dude.  "

,drapo666,2007-11-24T17:18Z,"hey guys
fuck for trying download last 0.01%
just go to total commander, to your download directory and if your file MOSTERS_OF_DEATH___AMERICA.ISO.*** has 3 753 537 536 bytes rename it to MOSTERS_OF_DEATH___AMERICA.ISO

it works
if you do not trust me, copy file to another place on your HDD and try it
im just watching and listening it ;-)

(sorry for my english)"
