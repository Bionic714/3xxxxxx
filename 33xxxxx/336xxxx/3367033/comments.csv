,xxxLesy,2005-08-13T23:45Z,"[quote]How i can make this video work tell me plz!!!!!!![/quote]
The name fantastic4.tc.xvid.avi says everything -> tc = telecinema (not good quality) video codec = XviD, filetype = .avi (the most used type, opened by all media players)"
,xxxjohnxxx,2005-08-14T20:21Z,"The file is just a little to big to be burned on a CD... Not good!

But that´s OK! There´s something wrong with the file anyway. It causes the player to crash. Can not be watched! 

Nice going! Don´t see this as critizism... See it as a tip for other downloaders to stay aay from this file!

LoL"
,disobedient,2005-08-16T19:06Z,"Since no one else is apparently intelligent enough to comment on something as complicated as the fucking video or audio quality for the benefit of the rest of us, I'll take a stab.  The video quality is decent widescreen, no theater people standing up or anything.  It's not DVD quality, but it's not too washed out... basically the best you'll find until the proper release.  The audio, on the other hand, is awful.  All treble, no mid-range or bass, and to make matters worse, there's an audio sync problem starting at position 1:07:44 that continues throughout the rest of the movie.  You can fix it in VirtualDub, but it would have been nice for D.O.C.1 to mention this beforehand (or better yet, FIX IT HIMSELF, DUMBASS)."
,disobedient,2005-08-16T19:21Z,Just to clarify a mistake I made: the audio DOES resync after a couple of minutes.  Apologies for the vitriol.
