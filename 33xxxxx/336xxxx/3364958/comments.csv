,Dakenz,2009-06-18T11:09Z,"@r@zer you numbfuck goof tool, a ""strong B movie is, to most, a good thing, learn something other then how your dick feels through a sock and maybe you'll not be as dumb-shit retarded, but probably not. This was in fact a horrible ""C"" movie at best, stay away, bad cgi, worse acting and just crap production, i'm sure there was a former star who died (inside) while doing this.."
