Skal vi bare erstatte de gamle filene med de nye?

Mvh

Gega"
,olson,2005-08-02T21:43Z,"Yes, just move the old files to another place (for later deletion) and put these in the directory instead. A small sfv file for just these four RARs is supplied, I have also tested unpacking the release to the .img file (though not had time to burn it)."
,olson,2005-08-02T21:47Z,"I get some ""Problem connecting to tracker - timeout exceeded"" so some of you may have trouble connecting, but I'm anyway connected and uploading to 6 clients."

Guess I'll better download it again now that ""olson"" proved to be such a sport. THANKS !!!!"
,hotrod30,2005-08-04T00:51Z,"tip
move the old corupt downloaded rar files (r38, r48, r83and r90) over the new before download, then start the download and it will start at 96,6%.

,r44mone,2005-08-05T07:16Z,"omg, I almost had a heart attack when I found out the old torrent had bad files. THANKS MAN!"
,olson,2005-08-10T13:12Z,"Någon som har en bra idé hur man får filmen att spela på DVD-spelare? Det saknas lite vob-filer och CloneDVD2 och andra vill inte försöka fixa filmen heller. DVD Decrypter kan demuxa den, men skapar utdata som inte går att få in i DVD-Lab Pro (brukar annars funka...)"
,mathsped,2005-08-11T11:56Z,"The Problem is that the rip is not DVD Compliant, as with MANY releases here on TPB. (Can be checked by first running DVDShrink).

The way I fix them, is to edit the IFO and VOB files with IfoEdit.

1a. Make a backup of all files if something goes wrong.
1. Create a folder called ex. ""IfoEdited"".
2. Run IfoEdit
3. Click Open
4. Choose the VTS_**_0.IFO corrsponding to where the main movie VOB's are (The 1 GB files), in this case VTS_01_0.IFO.
5. Click VOB Extras and click Create new IFO's
6. Set the Output directory to whatever you called it in step 1.
7. Leave all options as default except for Rebuild PTS which you tick,
8. Click OK and it will start rebuilding the VOBU pointers and build new IFO files.
9. Copy the newly created IFO and BUP files overwriting the old files in the original directory.
10. Run the resulted files thru DVD shrink or whatever to make sure you succeded.
11. Burn and play in any standalone player as the DVD is now compliant.

Good luck.
"
,olson,2005-08-11T20:58Z,"OK, I'll try that, thanks."
,olson,2005-08-12T00:24Z,"I tried IFOEdit but also chose to strip out all subtitles but one, forcing it to redo all VOBs as well. The new folder contains a complete set of files (without menu, just one stream each of video/audio/subtitles) that seems OK for both WinDVD and DVDShrink. I'll burn it and try it in my stand-alone, thanks!"
