,Jumex,2006-01-03T04:32Z,"Everything ok to install.
Only one problem. When I run for first time Pro/E I have an error message who says : "" 

License request failed for feature PROE_200: -9: 
Invalid host ""

And then Pro/E is closing....

I build the license as shown in the readme.txt...
and my physical address represents the connection I am using right now...??!!??!!??

Any help ???

Bye

,Jumex,2006-01-03T05:11Z,"It finally worked but I dont understand why.

I have two lines who leave my router. First is for USB and second for ethernet Cable.

My CPU is connected to the router via the USB. The ethernet is disabled and not connected.
But I had to enter the address of the ethernet line to activate Pro/E. The USB one was not working !!??!!??!!??

Thx Zuumo.

Bye

,Zuumo,2006-01-03T19:57Z,I know that the license is the big issue when installing this program. The hardware address used by ProE is the address shown in the lower-left corner when starting the installation. This SHOULD also be same as the one found when executing 'ipconfig /all' in a command window. At least that's how it works for me. I hope you'll manage to get it running on your computer! Good luck!
,ipod,2006-01-20T13:06Z,"Hi!
great upload. but how do i start the program after i installed it?

Nice if someone could help me. 
Many thaks"
,Zuumo,2006-01-22T20:55Z,Hi! You should find the ProEngineer shortcut under PTC in the Startmenu. Any error messages is probably due to a faulty hardware address in the license file. Please check the comments beneath. Good hunting!
,bONEZ_09,2006-02-08T16:54Z,I am having the same problem as Jumex with License request failed for feature PROE_200: -9: as an error message.  I created a fake license but with no luck.  Any suggestions?
,admandude,2006-02-14T06:14Z,"hey zuumo, i've tried everything you said, no working.  so when i set it up, i should make the host my physical address?  thanks dude"
,.BAD. Knox,2006-02-26T22:01Z,"ok... i got error 8 looked after... now i'm getting the standard -9 error, Invalid Host

my address in the license file is the same as the one when i start the installation. (and the same as one of the ones when I type ipconfig/all)"
,Zuumo,2006-03-05T14:19Z,"Hi! The address used for generating the license file should be the same that can be found in the lower-left corner of the installation window. However, if you're 100% certain that you have followed my directions, and still it doesn't work; then the installation may be too old. I don't know if the software has a 'best before date', but since a new version 'datecode' is released every now and then, this could be an effective way to remove old software from the market. Good luck!"
,newb_vu,2006-03-16T21:58Z,"i installed but it needed cd2 and 3 so i hit cancel, but it installed it all the way. now when i try to open it does nothing.

help please"
,Zuumo,2006-03-19T11:07Z,"Well, you have to use all three CD's when installing the application. Please consult the readme file and the comments above to solve your problems. I know it can be a bit troublesome to get it working with licenses and so on, but with 1800+ downloads, you should be able to get it working on your computer. Good luck!"
,bschroering,2006-04-12T22:26Z,"does anyone know how to insert cd 2 or 3 in installation. i have unpacked the files from winrar and also tried using daemon tools with this but i cant figure it out.
 help please"
,zdar,2006-05-04T11:37Z,"3) after install, open the ""license.dat"" from your
   license server install dir ""licensing"" and
   edit the Daemon path on second line to reflect
    your installed path. 

what does these sentences actually means?
the daemon path on my licensing is ""C:Program Filesflexlmi486_ntobjptc_d.exe"". Do i have to change it at all??"
,danzdanz,2006-05-12T19:11Z,"how the heck do u solve the ""-8 problem""? its the invalid (inconsistent) license key. i changed all of the 11-22-33 bla bla to my physical address. anyone noe the solution? help!"
