,ozaawiinimkize,2008-02-07T17:57Z,"okay. 
I seeded this for a while (about 2gigs) with good upload speed, but for the last couple of days i'm not connecting to any peers. 
I've tried adjusting the settings, but no luck. 
Not sure what's wrong here. 

any ideas? 

I'm willing to keep seeding if someone can throw me a bone.
