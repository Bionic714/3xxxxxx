Anybody got the missing chunk??"
,Tambarr,2011-08-05T11:41Z,"Downloaded this yesterday, took a long time without seeds and got to 99.5%, with a piece missing on track 8 [Gonna Creep Up On You] but on playing the track is all there OK, The same track is on Vagabonds Of The Western World...was going to replace, but no need..I cant seed this as the download won't finish..
Good Luck"" Oh and it is pretty rare."
