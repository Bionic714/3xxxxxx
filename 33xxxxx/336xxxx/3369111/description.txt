  In 2002, eight internationally renowned writers, poets and intellectuals ? including American novelist Russell Banks and Nobel laureates Jose Saramago and Wole Soyinka ? traveled to the West Bank and Gaza to visit poet Mahmoud Darwish and observe the state of the Palestinians living there. Documentary filmmakers Samir Abdallah and Jose Reynes alternate scenes from the writers' journey with testimonials from the Palestinian people, readings by Darwish and reflections from the concerned authors as they bear witness to what they see.
