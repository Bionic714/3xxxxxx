,bobert-bobert,2005-08-01T20:22Z,"Did a little research... ""Revolution Vol. 1"" and ""Revolution Vol. 2"" are Tech's first two albums, ""Point Of No Return"" and ""Bin Laden"" are two subsequent singles, and the other three (""St1ll Revolutionary"", ""Portable Immortal"" and ""The Silenced Revolution"") are unofficial fan compilations of live appearances, interviews, rare tracks, and collaborations.  IT's third official album will be entitled ""The Middle Passage""."

,ANicki_InTheUk,2007-07-17T14:10Z,"the reason it took you so long to hear him spit is because he aint signed to a record label he refuses to take their carrot on a stick prefering to publicise his music himself without corporate sponsors, or weren't you listening? If he was to recieve corporate label backing he'd have to start spitting about hoes and gold chains and other ignorant dumb shit because sadly, that is what the suits in charge want the masses to associate with hip hop. Spread techniques music this awakening is way overdue."
