At first glance, the Hasidic Jewish Rap/Reggae artist Matisyahu may seem like another gimmick pushed by the music industry in order to make a fast buck. One can easily picture a bunch of A&R execs thoroughly enthused at the marketability of an MC who sports a yarmulke. However, his 2005 J-Dub Records release, Live At Stubbs, is anything but a gimmick. Propelled by his recent Jimmy Kimmel Live performance, the "King Without A Crown" video in heavy rotation on the MTV U network, and a confirmed slot at this year's Bonnaroo festival, Matisyahu is quickly making a name for himself in the music industry.
