AutoUpdate+ is an application that easily allows you
    to   add  updating/upgrading  capabilities  to  your
    software. With today's shortening product developmen
    cycles  and  an always existing need to add features
    and fix application bugs, it has become mandatory to
    provide  automatic  updating  capabilities  for your
    software.  The  AutoUpdate+  application is the only
    application you will find on the market that is full
    XML  based  and  which  allows  for  complete remote
    configuration of all client behaviors and messages.
