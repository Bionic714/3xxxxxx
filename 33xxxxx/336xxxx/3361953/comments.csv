,bigboy25,2005-07-30T03:22Z,"can someone tell me how you play it once you are at the loading screen the one that is black with white letters and you need to press cirule or other buttons to play it for UMD , file, output. I do not know if you guys are getting this screen as I am."
,bigboy25,2005-07-30T03:26Z,And your you dely888 just put the SSS_Game on the root which is:.. For example if you plug your psp to your computer it will let you know what letter your memory card is. It might be F: or G: or other letter. Ok know lets say that yours is the letter F: the root of your psp. Just put the SSS_Game file like this.... F:SSS_Game and the other the file PSP do not put it on there. You do not need to put it on the root. Just go in the PSP folder and then Game and what ever you find there put them on your PsP console under F:PSPGames and the two files goes here.
