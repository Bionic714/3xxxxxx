One of the best race games ever!

Exciting, fast and fun game with excellent visuals (for a game published in 1998), quite hard gameplay (especially for beginners :) and cool techno music, which suits the game very well.
These cars feel like they really have mass... keeping them on track requires good skills.

Give it a try!
