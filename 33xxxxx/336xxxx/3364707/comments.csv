,karlssonfelix,2007-09-11T03:32Z,"hate to ruin your happyness about finding this game here, but it seems a bit suspicious. 1.74 GiB?

well, I don't have a modded xbox so i'm not gonna try it out anyhow but, i think you should be a little careful. if it is real, then I just want to ask you tx81 to not give it a title like that.
Title it the name of the torrent file instead, it's much more informative. well don't mind me, i'm just trying to help you NOT to waste your time on  downloading something thats bad for you. good day!"
