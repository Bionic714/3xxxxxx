,lennart84,2005-08-11T05:39Z,"do you have or can you get the remaining seasons too?
Thx for this season by the way :)"
,mazement,2005-08-13T03:15Z,*** NOTE ABOUT FUTURE SEASONS *** I'm sharing the other seasons at d-addicts.com and afterwards I realized that I could figure out how to set up an external tracker for thepiratebay.org. If anyone else knows how to do this then feel free to set it up for me; otherwise just go over to d-addicts and search for the title. (Season 11 went up today and I'm going to do Season 12 next week...I only have the three seasons.)
