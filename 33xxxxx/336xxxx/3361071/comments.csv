,Lehzthohm,2005-07-28T16:31Z,WARNING : This game is highly possible the beta version and not the retail. so it could be a bit buggy. REASON: Released.: REL Date ..... : 09/06/2005 
,nylo,2005-07-29T09:19Z,Pleeease explain how to burn this....
,god-slayer,2005-07-30T20:09Z,"Please be aware that the US version is censored.

Pointlessly cheap items
No decapitation or limb severing.

The US version is censored/dumbed down garbage."
,DeadKing,2005-07-31T19:52Z,Anyone have the noncensored PAL version? Ive seen it on other sites but its not downloading.
,rumuniusz,2005-08-01T19:53Z,"strange release. i've burned it 3 times and can't start game form dvd drive. but after install on hdd everything was ok, till saving... i rather  prefer us censored version (working with hdd)"
,god-slayer,2005-08-02T14:35Z,"None would prefer a butchered version of the game, thats just idiotic. You have to wait for the retail PAL as it's not released yet. The no-censored pal one is a BETA copy, and it's actuallt NTSC. They ALL work on HDLoader.

 Once again this version is garbage and a waste of time."
