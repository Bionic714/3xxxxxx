EPiSODE iNFORMATiON:

WAKE UP CALL, PART 1.
One year after the events on Highland Beach
revealed that the 4400 were taken and returned by
future humans, the world is a very different
place. Tom and Diana investigate a mysterious
structure being built at a psychiatric hospital,
based on the drawings of one of their patients
who is a 4400.



RiPPERS NOTES:

If you look on epguides, the first 'double
episode' should probably have been labelled as
two seperate eps. It has aired here as such, but
we feel that it would only cause confusion to
play around with the episode numbering. Therefore
we have labelled the first episode as part1 and
next week we intend to release 2x01 part 2.

Enjoy this great release from BiA.
