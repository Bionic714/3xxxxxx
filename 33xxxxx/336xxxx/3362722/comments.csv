,KalleKofot,2005-07-31T01:13Z,So this is the game Halo2? and why is it in the MOVIEDVDR section?
,ANP_,2005-07-31T10:27Z,"No, this is not the game Halo 2. It is a DVD movie which contains secret stuff and such from Halo 2. Read the description for more info."
,Someone stole my nick,2005-08-03T21:22Z,"Hi. It's me Smurfa. Unfortunately someone stole my nickname.

I have something very important to tell you all. There are som errors in the information section.

1. Of course, I know that Joseph Staten makes the voice of the Grunts. I am sorry that I wrote Jason Jones. I always mix up these two people. I am sorry Mr. Staten. 
When I thought about I realised that it is probably Joseph that says ""...the ultimate anti-son-of-a-bitch-stick..."" to. Once again I appology for the error.

2. The ammunition in the M7 Submachine Gun is not 9mm. It is 5x23mm. I appology for this to."
,Wonkel,2005-08-04T11:07Z,"WOW! This DVD is f*ucking awesome! Every fan of Halo must download it! Lots of good information and really proffesionally made, and the menus etc. are better than those of the movies you buy!"
,ANP_,2005-08-04T20:12Z,"Thanks Wonkel, glad you liked it.

,ANP_,2005-08-05T10:51Z,"Are you watching the DVD on a computer? If so you will need a DVD software to properly render the film. Try PowerDVD, WinDVD or any other DVD software and see if it helps."
,ANP_,2005-08-07T16:53Z,Maybe if you explained what your problem is we might be able to help you.
