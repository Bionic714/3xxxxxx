This is one of the best most soothing & relaxed albums ever made imho. One of the best albums aswell of course. It doesnt really matter that I dont understand a word Valencian, the music is still great :D

Outstanding Spanish folk record superbly recorded by Daevid Allen (from Soft Machine) in 1976. This, the only album released by Pep Laguarda, was originally released in 1978 on the Ocre label (a sublabel of the infamous Belter), and today more than ever gets amazing reviews and feedbacks everywhere. Pep was helped by people like Daevid Allen and Pau Riba on this legendary album. Musically, it's the very highlight in the Spanish folk-rock history; melodic, hippie, well-crafted and with a strong Mediterranean feel, all these songs seem to be as young as they were in 1978.     

Theres a CD-ROM included with the Deluxe Edition of the CD, I chose to include it with the upload, because; a) alternate versions of tracks like "Alceu-vos, xe, que ja és de dia" and b) It contains a kickass video "Blues milanta anys-llum" by Pep, a classic cartoon-psychedelic music-video that is very well worth seeing.
