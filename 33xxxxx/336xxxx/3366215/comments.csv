,JimXRS,2005-08-07T06:37Z,I thought this game was only for the XBox 360?!
,thirty eight,2005-08-07T08:01Z,Sweet titt'ehs!
,thirty eight,2005-08-07T11:56Z,When is NHL '06 releasing?
,digger44,2005-08-07T17:00Z,release date is aug.9 todays the 7th hmmm pretty cool if real!!!
,SimUser,2005-08-08T01:42Z,"This is an US release, therefore it is NTSC, so your PAL unit in Holland won't play it."
,fall-line,2005-08-08T02:06Z,"Thanks!

Will seed"
,bgduece,2005-08-08T02:45Z,This is officially fake...to many people are freezing when the game start up...who ever is the bastard the uploaded this will get his...
,sensi420,2005-08-08T05:44Z,"it works fine i tested it before i uploaded it
it has not been nuked
ur just a dumbass that cant  get it to work"
,bgduece,2005-08-08T09:26Z,"A lot of people are having problems with this game...like me...when you try to start the game it freezes....for some people they are not having problems, and the game plays fine...but if I was the only one having problems, I might agree that I was a dumb ass, but it is not only me, and we all have the same problem...has any one come up with a resolution. I can not get this game to play off the DVD or the Hard drive"
,SimUser,2005-08-08T10:09Z,"I have yet to have a problem with this release, it's not fake, and the seeder/leacher count is way off, it is more like 20/280"
,plakskull,2005-08-08T14:06Z,"This sounds like the same problem people were having running Forza Motorsport.  People complained that the ISO was fake and it really was not.  I had the problem where it wouldn't load also, but after much effort, I figured out what was wrong.

Give this a shot: Try updating your MS Dashboard.  Apparantly, some games will not run unless they have a particular level of MS dashboard in place (even if you're not booting through the normal process).

Use a file manager to browse the content of the ISO and check if there's a dashboard update on board.  If so, launch that updater from Avalaunch or something and it may fix the problem.  That was what solved the problem for me with Forza."
,digger44,2005-08-08T16:17Z,"works great, big thankyou,hut1 hut 2 hut hut hut,gone to play,seeya"
,plakskull,2005-08-08T19:09Z,"Worked 100% for me, btw, right away with no problems..."
,pbid81,2005-08-08T19:42Z,Yeah I had a similar problem with forza motorsports as well. It is easy to fix. BURN SLOWER. I've been having problems with certain games that I burn at 8x onto Ritek Ridata discs. I've been burning at 6x and games work flawelessly. If you still have problems try 4x or 2x. This will almost certainly work.
,thirty eight,2005-08-08T19:52Z,"Works great; no problems here.  
Thanks sensi420."
,thirty eight,2005-08-08T19:53Z,"It's all about having a hard-drive on the XBox.  I use to get these retarded read errors on Tiger Woods 2005; no read errors on the HDD ever, plus it's at least 2.5 times quicker load time."
,lullabubby,2005-08-09T04:44Z,"i grabbed this game and it works np but i will say and i'm not suprised that this game is nowhere near as good as the 2k nfl games which was why i was bummed when i heard EA got exclusive NFL rights. sorry but 2K5 not only looks better, has more features and such, it just plain plays better to. Madden is way to robotic and the 'new' passing implentation is crap. with 2K5 you could completely control your passes without the stupid 'vision' field that looks like a flashlight showing up on the screen, wtf? it's just my two cents but don't take my word for it. grab nfl 2K5 and you'll see what i mean. EA has been resting on it's laurels for way too long when it comes to sports games. the other titles are just plain better games."
,Tronglonok,2005-08-09T13:17Z,"Hey, Im having trouble with.. well most of my new games.. So its not just this one.. :P
But when I try to play a game from the HD the green Evolution X logo appears, and it just locks up. Have I managed to screw something up in settings or so? Because Im pretty clueless to about Xbox things hehe

glad for some help... "
,urxgrlfriend,2005-08-09T22:38Z,"Please, someone, upload this for PC!!"
,wtf_2005,2005-08-09T22:47Z,beware. the file in the root is called DASHUPDATE.XBE. this has a surprisingly small number of files and an obvious demo game. im not using this at all.
,Prodigy_000,2005-08-09T23:26Z,Anyone know when there will be a PC realease for Madden 2006?

,telly_79,2005-08-11T18:47Z,anyone know where i could get an update for the rosters?
,TheNorthPole,2005-08-12T14:42Z,"Why is it, when i unpack it once, that I get a 3,5 giga zip file again? The guy who cracked the game didn't leave any instructions for the burning of the game? Can anybody help me? Should I just burn the zip file? If anybody was wondering, its my first time downloading a Xbox game ;)"
,skunkbun,2005-08-12T15:38Z,Seed plz
,bgduece,2005-08-12T19:12Z,"We Have A fix... Microsoft has a update to their dashboard, that has to be updated for burned Madden 2006 to run. Just put a recently purchased or rented game (legit) and boot the retail BIOS. that will update the MS Dashboard, and then your burned game will work fine, on the DVD or the Hard drive."
,chasing_amy,2005-08-15T14:43Z,"hey i grabbed this one too, same story i get to the press start screen and then i get a dirty disk error.

,pokersucs,2005-08-16T19:51Z,Get the damn spammers out of here.  Nobody is going to read that crap sfgiants559.  Go get a real job!
,johnnyblack,2005-08-17T13:52Z,"For those of you still having trouble with the freezing, I just uploaded an EvoX BIOS and EvoX Dash to pbay. Make sure you read the blurb at the top before attempting anything. I am not responsible if you screw up your xbox.
I currently use this BIOS and Dash with the X-BIT chip and I have no problems running Madden 06.

The EvoX M8plus BIOS can be found here --> http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3371038

,bobafett14,2005-08-18T03:53Z,Can we get the PC version please?
,pokersucs,2005-08-18T06:11Z,This game installed great. No problems and played fine without any errors or having to adjust any settings. I'm running a Xenium Ice solder with a Phillips HD.  Remember to burn on slowest setting. I burned at 2x
