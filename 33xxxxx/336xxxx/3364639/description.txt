Unique documentary about the Japanese professor Kenji Sugimoto, who crosses the US to find the object of his desire: Albert Einstein's brain. His obsession, along with his less-than-stellar English skills and his cultural dispositions, makes him come across as a borderline madman, but there's no denying his heart is in the right place. This excellent and disturbingly heartwarming documentary about obsession and catharsis is extremely difficult to track down, so don't miss this opportunity.

Recorded to VHS from Swedish television, so the audio/video isn't perfect by any means. Credit cards, title screen and written on-screen information have been translated back to English, Swedish subtitles are still intact.
