,fuckface_,2005-08-03T22:02Z,"Toy: Geovid flash to video encoder, Then encoded raw videodata to DVD mpeg format with TMPGEnc (This will give better results than those 'quick' encoding methods which can be found in many dvd burning softwares). Then created menus, chapters etc. usual bullshit with 'TMPGEnc  DVD author' sowtware."
