,CHEEZOR2,2005-07-27T06:33Z,Dane Cook Rocks!
,kefkakrist,2005-07-27T17:27Z,"I feel like such a F'n Fool.  I bought this CD in the pre-order from Comedy Central so I could have it as soon as possible.  I expected I would receive it the day it hit retailers and I bought it to avoid the unpleasant situation of my local retailers not having it.  Well, it's like 2 days later and I still have not received it.  My local places have it and I don't.  It's even up and available at Pirate Bay and I don't have it.  Needless to say I'm pissed.  Why did I pay $25 for a CD that I could have gotten for $15 retail or even I could have gotten free???"
,FoxMcWeezer,2005-07-28T22:53Z,fuck you dumbass. why buy audio when you have torrent
,joelanders,2005-08-04T03:57Z,"""FoxMcWeezer,""  you are fucking ignorant trash.  Scum like you make us all look bad."
,casanovatx,2005-08-04T06:24Z,Thanks. Will seed when done
,xx0xx,2006-02-05T21:42Z,"half of the people that claim that downloading torrents is just for previewing end up not buying it and just keeping the downloaded copy.

mcweezer may have a good point."
,xx0xx,2006-02-05T21:43Z,"as far as ""looking bad"" goes. downloading torrents already makes you look ""bad"" ... so what difference does his comment really make?"
,JesusEatsBabies,2006-09-08T06:56Z,"Thanks so much for this, I've been trying to get it for like a year. and I don't care if this makes me look bad, sometimes I do keep the downloaded version forever but if I really like I DO end up buying it so the only things I don't buy are the things I don't like and downloading things before buying saves me a lot of money I don't have"
,MickeyMouse_,2006-09-11T00:11Z,"At the moment it has seeders, but if this goes dry and you need seeders you can grab Retaliation from here.

,frent2,2008-03-20T03:28Z,i need seed! plz seed!
,arsenal1001,2008-05-02T17:55Z,is this this available as a video? not just mp3?
,Propaganda187,2008-06-25T01:11Z,"lol, I am bad, more than 40 gigs flow though this comp, and since Im in Canada, they really cant do shit. But in the spirit of pirating, I seed usualy 4 times.

And think about this, before Elvis, do you know ho much performers were getting paid? Hockey Stars of the era were getting more, and that was barely enough. 

Im sick of all this Brittany Spears or Hip Hop that cares about getting rich off there music than the soul that created it.

think about it, these downloads are helping to contribute to the musical revolution, creating a world where artists compete for the love of the music, not about how fat there wallets are. Support the Musical revolution.

DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT TODAY!"
,Propaganda187,2008-06-25T01:11Z,I meant 40 gigs / month
