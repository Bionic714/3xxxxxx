That initial release of this book that was plastered all over torrent sites had porbably thousands of mistakes. Was really annoying to read. 

So I went through and fixed everything I could. I even fixed ALL the formatting (fonts, italics, bold, anything and everything I could find) and inserted all the missing letters, words, or sentences. (Cross referenced to the original book)
This copy is 99.99% accurate and you will probably NEVER find a better copy on the internet unless the publishers bring out a e-book.

So whether you still have to read it, or you want a copy for reference, here it is.
