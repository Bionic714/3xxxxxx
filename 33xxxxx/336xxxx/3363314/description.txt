WWW File Share Pro is a small HTTP server that can help you share files with your friends. They can download files from your computer or upload files from theirs. Simply specify a directory for downloads and a directory for uploads. Your friends can download/upload files via browser (IE/Netscape/Opera/Firefox etc.) They will not be required to install this software or any other software because an internet browser is enough. WWW File Share Pro supports password protection. If you enable password protection, only authorized user can access your service.

What's new:
* Improved the core of the HTTP engine.
Now the performance of version 3.20 is much better than all previous versions (version 3.0, 2.72, 2.60, etc.). That's why we strongly recommend that all users upgrade to version 3.20.
* The new version provides a optimize performance sliderbar for you to control the performance (on the Settings > Options panel).
* Added 5 new presets.
