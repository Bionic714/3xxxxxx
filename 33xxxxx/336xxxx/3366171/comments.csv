,jeezy103,2008-03-25T08:54Z,"im not sure what the problem really is...
it runs alright.. but its exptremely slow.... ii mean slow as in laggy....
here's an example... say i try to swing a blade... he'l take like 5mins to retract then swing his arm.. and my harddrive(which im running the game from) isn't impaired in anyway at all.. iv'e got over 20 games in there and they all run flawlessly.
I even burned this to a disc and tried running it from there, yet the same problem still persists....
BTW., the lag only appears in character animations such as swinging, running, etc.. fmvs run flawlessly and the bgm plays flawlessly as well... 
so what is this weird phenomenun??"
