,yess11,2006-03-10T11:51Z,"What am I supposed to do? 
I downloaded the files and tried mounting it with daemon tools. But it said
""unable to mount image. Cue sheet: line 1 - File not accessable""

What am I supposed to do? Has it something to do with vlc? It opens in vlc if I click on it. VLC made these files automaticly VLC files"
