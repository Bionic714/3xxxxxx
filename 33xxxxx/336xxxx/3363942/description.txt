'arrr, Game_Over_-_Nintendo_Metal_(Remastered_Edition)-2005-NmE
The band's website: http://www.nintendometal.com/

I'd prefer them without the lyrics actually, but I'm gonna request an instrumental album and see if they're willing to release/send one or so.

Uploaded this because there didn't seem to be a scene release on this site for the album.
