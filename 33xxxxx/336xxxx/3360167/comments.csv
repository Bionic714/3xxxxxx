,gregorius,2005-07-30T11:05Z,"sorry i have to disappoint you but this is just bullshit! this guy talking a lot and showing faked photos...just look at his 'Beamship Trilogy' somewhere at the middle of this 'documentary', where he stands together with some people telling his story about the 'fighter' with an 'uninvited visitor' and look at the 'ufo' picture together with the 'fighter' in slow motion - it's probably some sort of magic combined with ufology when the ufo disappears from the static picture some frames before the rest of the picture goes away...."

where im standing, you look like bullshit.
only a halfwit from medieval times would retort to magic as an explanation for modern science.
lmao 
dude.. you really need to go get some technical education. 
here i'll give you a hint. if you change the frequency of the sound from 1kHz to 30 kHz you'll make it inaudible. 
same with the light. change the frequency of the light and you'll make it invisible.
go back to school and ask yer teacher to show you how it is done.
or someone with some tech knowledge.

peace out"
