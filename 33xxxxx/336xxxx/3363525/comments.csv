just copy the carbon file to 

Library\Audio\Plug-Ins\VST

then you can use it as a vst plugin inside your host DAW.

Thanks a lot man, really small but very useful and cool plugins.

Too bad, for all you intel-mac users, it's a PPC only.

I'm also looking for the UB version for my MBP

Thanks!"
,jolo06,2008-03-27T18:26Z,I have an intel mac and it worked for me with Cubase SL3 just fine.  But now that I upgraded to Studio 4 it doesn't work anymore. someone should upload the patch to universal binary.

Did some investigating.  BBE SONIC MAXIMIZER for intel macs should be coming out around May.
be patient.  Soon we shall have it."
