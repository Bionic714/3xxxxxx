,ribit,2008-12-30T01:01Z,"There's a lot of hype in the above description  - Daniela did not invent this music alone. Her early work with Ilê Aiyê (a few tracks in the 90s) was a collaboration. True that her good taste and voice makes her an important artist from Bahia. But who is really the innovator here is Carlinhos Brown, the producer. (He is a percussionist and performer who not only works/worked with Daniela, but Timbalada and Marisa Monte, and the Cuban pianist, Bebo Valdez. He is also a terrific composer.) What Daniela does do right in Carnaval is that she mixes up the music and plays the range of Brasilian music rather than the coupe of dozen songs that most of the bands stick to. If you visit Salvador during Carnaval, it's worth being in ber bloco."
