Second demo tape from this Portuguese metal band, recorded at the Rec. n' Roll Studios. This one was in fact considered a cult demo in the Portuguese metal scenario at the time, being on several underground compilations of worldwide distribution, receiving overriding reviews--also worldwide--, and acquiring the attention of big labels to the band's melodic death metal sound.
