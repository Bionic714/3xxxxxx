This is the Evinrude outboard motor division of Bombardier Recreationsl Products infomercial that ran on t.v. regarding their new line of high performance 2-stroke E-Tec outboard motors.

The video shows why the E-Tec two-stroke design is superior to the four-stroke design and shows several performance and statistical comparisons against Yamaha and Mercury outboard motors.

If you are in the market for a new outboard motor for your skiboat, bass boat, or other recreational watercraft you should take a look at the performance tests shown and independently verified in this program.
