,shady78,2005-08-08T02:48Z,i figured it out i usually have my game reign set to defaul ive been playing around and i get the same error on all settings but default if you set your game reign to default it should work
,shady78,2005-08-08T17:46Z,just change your game regn to default and it will play just fine
,shady78,2005-08-08T17:51Z,"im playing right now from my disc all i had to do was chand the game reign from NTSC to DEFAULT all other settings will display the error

to change reign go to seystem management in evox then to settings then scroll down through all the shit till you come to game reign if you have ntsc xbox the top setting will be ntsc the one right below can be changed to ntsc, ntsc japan, pal(rest of the world) auto, and default choose default"
,shady78,2005-08-08T19:31Z,no problem the only problem is these stupid p2p clients not giving like dc++ where this came from but i swear im playing this now all other settings other than default gives me the stupid missing file error
