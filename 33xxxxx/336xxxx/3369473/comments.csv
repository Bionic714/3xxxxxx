,shady78,2005-08-14T03:24Z,i have another question i use gr torrent and have cable internet but it only lets me upload at 100 kbs when im capable of 100mb/s does anybody know how to tweak my settings so i can upload faster 
,northerner,2005-08-14T04:14Z,Being technically capable of uploading 100 mbit doesn't actually mean you're capable of uploading 100 mbit over the Internet. What kind of ISP would sell a 100/100 mbit service?
,shady78,2005-08-14T11:54Z,i have adelphia cable and in my lan settings it says connected at 100 mbps that is all i know
,davidtr,2005-08-14T19:33Z,"the connection speed usually displays your download bandwidth. The upload is usually narrower since home clients consum information and not vice versa.
