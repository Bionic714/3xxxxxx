,remiel,2005-07-30T11:04Z,would it be possible to have the videos as well?
,digirom,2005-08-02T07:53Z,"I don't understood your question remiel (I'm not English)...

You asked if it would be possible to have ALL the clips of Muse?

The answer is no :( only these 4, because I haven't others on DVD... :("
,digirom,2005-08-02T07:54Z,"Sorry, the videos are posted too... search for MUSE on piratebay...
I thought I was in a videoclip post when I answered you :)"
,remiel,2005-08-10T17:51Z,"Sweet! Thank you ever so much, mate! Highly appreciated!"
,Zorn1881,2006-02-24T02:48Z,I need a seed or 5!  :p
,Lichie,2006-12-26T22:13Z,"yeah, I'm stupid to.. how do you play them?? ( är svensk om det hjälper.. kanske är lättare att förklara då?) seed please!"
,badwaldsee,2007-03-22T23:31Z,just download foobar2k its a player that will let you hear hi-fi flac files.
,Innominate,2007-06-30T20:20Z,"What the hell? Each CD only has 3 songs in it, not the full rip!"
,Innominate,2007-06-30T20:22Z,"4 FLAC cds would be a hell of a lot larger than 200 mb. Like I said, not the full rip. Do not waste your time."
,JonnyDr,2007-12-06T00:39Z,Excellent collection of uploads mate. Nice to see some lossless! Do you have Black Holes by any chance?
,pilyoto,2008-12-18T06:18Z,can someone please reseed this? thanks in advance!
