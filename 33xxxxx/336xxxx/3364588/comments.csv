,Exodus666,2007-11-12T07:26Z,"231 mb, im guessing the quality is quite crappy.
But aj well its a must-have."
,EG_riFF_5,2008-04-20T01:30Z,its was only aired once and never re-released after that bc it was pretty bad i heard...so any copies of it now were made from its one airing in 1978 mostly likely so its prolly hard to find a quality version
,nathannihilator,2008-11-22T04:31Z,quality really poor.  There are better options out there now.
