[T],watercamp,2009-06-19T19:43Z,"Thanks for this box.


I saw John at Woodstock and this puts me right back there ""way up on the hill"" on that sunny saturday afternoon, I can almost taste the hash we were smoking.

Happy 40th anniversary!"
,dgs2004,2010-11-21T22:45Z,Track 1...track 2...NO SONG TITLES...you dumb piece of shit
,Saki33,2011-01-15T21:17Z,"Well, yes, it would have been more convenient to already have the song titles on them, but anyone can copy and paste them in from the track list provided. I am just grateful that these are provided, the only torrent here, for one of my all time favorite performers.

Thank you very much, and I apologize for all of us grateful recipients for the one ingrate."
,LazarusL,2011-08-21T10:24Z,"I join in thanking you, rasgoan, for this treasure. Retitling 79 tracks will be a bit tedious....but so what? Free treasure is worth a tad of tedium. And nothing excuses dgs2004's rudeness."
,LazarusL,2011-08-22T10:12Z,"Wow, that was weird! I downloaded the torrent, I seeded it back to a ratio of 1.10....and now suddenly it is GONE, not on any tracker, there is no such torrent anywhere that Transmission can detect. I guess I'll stop trying to seed it...but I wonder what happened. I wanted to keep seeding it for a couple of weeks, just out of love for Sebastian's music."
