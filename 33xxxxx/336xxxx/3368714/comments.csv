,bt72hw,2005-08-13T04:11Z,"""A Fistful of Dollars"" - made in 1964 is Sergio Leone's first film in a trilogy about The Man With No Name. It is widely considered to be one of the finest ""Spaghetti Westerns"" ever made.

And when one considers it is a re-make of Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece ""Yojimbo"" starring Clint Eastwood there should be little doubt as to why ""Fistful"" has earned such a reputation! Simply awesome!

All the AsianTorrents people should check this one out too, quite an interesting take on Kurosawa to be sure.  "
