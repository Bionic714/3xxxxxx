SIPOL
Unplug and Play (Phils, 2004)


?Light, breezy and playful.?
That's how most listeners described SIPOL's music. I really enjoyed their songs, and their cool rhythms. Adjeng's (vocalist) husky yet soothing voice was beautiful along with Sorioso's guitars and vocals.

Although they were quite underated when they released their album.. Sipol, I think gave one of the nicest offerings to the Phil music industry last year. If you liked MYMP and Nina Live!, you will probably enjoy this, Unplug and Play.

Six (6) songs are in english, the rest is sang with english and tagalog (taglish).
