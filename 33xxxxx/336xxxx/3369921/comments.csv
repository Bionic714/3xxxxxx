If governments in the west listened to Mr. Friedman, we would all live in heaps of luxury, and there would be no more starving people on earth!
Skitschysst! Tack så mycket!

,caterpilar,2006-04-08T17:07Z,"Tack så mycket, mycket intressant och sevärt! Ett rent nöje att ta del av Friedmans tankar!"
,caterpilar,2006-08-13T15:31Z,Another torrent that I enjoyed very much here on the Pirate Bay is the documentary ?Globalisation is good? by the Swedish liberal and intellectual Johan Norberg. (http://johannorberg.net) It was made for British channel 4. Mr Norberg is a free trade advocate just as Mr Friedman is. The torrent can be found here: http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3314851
,gotamd,2006-11-11T18:59Z,Everyone who is interested in economics or politics should watch these videos.  Their message is both powerful and timeless.

Maybe you should stop reading that marxist bullshit and open your mind to the greatness that is MILTON FRIEDMAN and his ideology of FREEDOM"

Oh come on, is that the best you can do? Of all the critics of Milton Friedman and capitalism, you happened to choose one of the most moronic. She took a phrase Friedman used completely out of context and turned it this book right here. You think I'm kidding? Watch some interviews of her on youtube. "
,vidiation,2009-03-16T03:09Z,"Video quality suffers a bit on some of the episodes, but the message comes thru loud and clear - LET FREE MARKETS BE FREE!  Thanks for the upload, will seed to 500%."
,vidiation,2009-03-18T10:32Z,"As others have noted, the video quality on some eps is shaky at best, but for me does not reduce the powerful impact of the message.  Better yet, read the books:

Milton Friedman - Capitalism and Freedom:

Milton Friedman - Free to Choose:

,Dadutta,2010-11-08T00:15Z,Thank you !
,PzGrenLBtl,2010-12-13T15:06Z,"Yes, his books are definitely worth a look.
Friedman was a great in arguing. Only Lenin might have been better."
,Smith1512,2011-01-07T16:48Z,Thanks a lot.
,crazysoccerman14,2011-02-13T21:50Z,Top quality. Thank you.
,mojavapleez,2011-03-14T14:41Z,"Today, during the second term of the Carter administration, a big dose of 'Uncle Milton' is exactly what we need.  He's Ayn Rand, with a little charm added - 'a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.'"
,diogotome,2011-09-24T13:32Z,"Thank you ever so much for uploading this awesome series, sir. Milton Friedman is pure class."
,AlexLibman,2012-07-12T00:01Z,"One of the greatest documentaries ever made!

And please don't ruin the intellectual atmosphere of this page by mentioning a brainless deranged political tool like Naomi Klein."
