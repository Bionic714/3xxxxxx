2005 MEGARIPPERSÂ© EXCLUSIVE SNEAKPEAK! 

Believe it or not, this is an exclusive Enrique Iglesias cover song feat the well known Baha-men! Mr Iglesias does his thing with sweet Amy Diamonds mega-international hit "What's in it for me". The recording is a bit poor but this is only a pre-release, never to hit the stores or charts. But we, as ususal, got our dirty little paws on this material. Enjoy! *:o)
