,TAO2004,2005-08-02T04:57Z,Why must you compress it into an MP4 no one likes that codec and it is not a very friendly one anyways. you can get just as good a quality movie in VCD or AVI form format! not trying to be ungrateful but you put a burden on us people who don't know where to find all the good convertors or mp4 dvd makers and want to rely on good ol nero to burn it. :)
,TAO2004,2005-08-02T04:58Z,Why MP4??? Not being ungrateful but it is a very unuser friendly codec. and it's not much better then VCD or AVI. 
,kidaware,2005-08-02T05:39Z,mp4 is quite nice...small...good...quality...works great with VLC...more movies should be released in mp4 format...
,Teknikal,2005-08-02T17:29Z,"i rate mp4 pretty good myself mplayer has no problems at all with it i would grab this but i got the xvid yesterday just posted because i think it's ridiculous the amount of people who complain about formats when they could just go grab it in whatever format they want anyway

if you dont like the format download the other versions and dont complain about it 

thnx spank btw i have grabbed a few of your releases and it's saved me bandwidth and im sure if this is the same source as the xvid i saw qualitys very good "

,bombproof,2005-08-16T12:35Z,"I think mp4 is easier to download then I use Nero 6 to burn onto Dvd Via Vision Express which you add mp4 files and burn to hard drive 1st which saves it as a .vob file(dvd media) then I do the same but burn onto disc using the vob files thus you get better pixel rate watching on tv, spank your the man, dont let the frustrated put you down man"

,tloveland,2006-08-15T03:34Z,"MP4 is mostly what I look for when I'm downloading full movies, because I always end up encoding AVIs to put on my iPod Video anyway!"
