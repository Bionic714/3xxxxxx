,skol,2005-08-02T02:55Z,"Hi,

there are no other subs than the english ones when the indians speak their own language"
,lpy,2005-08-09T15:12Z,Was it just my download that was missing ctu-itw.part5.cd1.r30? 
,lpy,2005-08-09T15:37Z,disregard the last post... thanks for the series.
,skol,2005-08-10T02:58Z,"Stop spreading lies ZenFerret, all the files you need is included in this .torrent

I'll give you a hint: 607 files and totals 8,2GB, almost all are 15MB in size. a CD is approx. 700MB.
Do the math next time ZenFerret!

,LOL-Bar-LOL,2006-04-19T16:14Z,"I can't extract the first part yet, but I downloaded 50% of the 6 parts! How is this possible! I have the newest WinRAR!"
,ekkertnafnlaust2,2006-04-22T02:52Z,i too have trouble opening it with my winrar?
,Zanfi,2006-07-08T14:09Z,"Ok I´m stuck at 99.9%, Why????
Could somebody please seed. Today???!!"
[V],Northward,2006-07-09T20:56Z,It´s incredible! WHY are there som many leechers who won´t seed!??? You selfish idiots!
,Ninjor krossar,2006-07-31T13:20Z,"I agree, ThePiratebay isnt about that you should download and then give a damn about everyone else. Its about that you download a torrent and then seed it so others, just like you, can have the torrent. If nobody would seed then TPB wouldnt work.

,zaltan,2006-08-06T22:14Z,"LOL-Bar-LOL: It can be because you download small packages randomly, and not in order. You probably need to download the whole thing before extracting it."
,sweeddick,2006-08-08T16:13Z,"jag har bränt ut detta men det står att ""the rent is out????måste man se denna på datorn?"
,medved1,2006-08-11T20:59Z,"This Rip is NOT GOOD. Only the last part is complete (1 hour 29 min), the rest is 34 to 56 min.
Do NOT use your time to download this film, find another torrent. "
,_-WoK-_,2006-08-20T10:42Z,the files are complete. Those who not find it complete are just to rushed to extract all parts. Thanks for this torrent! I would download the non-HR versions but I can't find them so I guess this will do.
,shabbay,2006-10-05T15:27Z,"Hi does anyone has the third serie for me? I have downloaded all parts seperately but I'm missing part 3. Who can help me? Thanks.
"
,Spacker,2006-11-19T19:09Z,"Many thanks for this! Downloaded perfectly. Unpacked perfectly. Plays perfectly, and the quality is stunning. I'll be seeding this for quite some time :-)"
,havjoh83,2006-11-27T15:12Z,"Hi. I am having trouble hearing the voices. The sound else is perfect. Anybody have a solution?

Thanks for the upload."
,havjoh83,2006-11-27T15:20Z,"Found it out. Now everything plays perfectly

I will seed, be sure of that. And to the selfish bastards who is no, go put your head in the sand.

regards"
,Brian Pickles,2006-11-29T21:23Z,"I too am having problems with no audio. The rest of the download is brilliant, with crystal clear images. What tool do I need to open the the audio?"
,boundless,2006-12-15T23:44Z,I still hope this torrent is active.
,NisseP,2006-12-20T07:33Z,"It seems to be active.. still in december ..
Wish there would be swedish subtitles for this. My parents woould probably love this.. even if it was broadcasted on swedish TV some time ago - don't remember when though.. I remember i missed some episodes and i would love to see this miniseries complete... with subtitles too. i am a bit lazy sometimes."
