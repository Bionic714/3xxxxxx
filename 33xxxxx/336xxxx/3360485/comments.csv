,satandro,2007-04-04T13:12Z,"It would seem that this is a game for macs.  The game disc images are in TOAST format.  Who the fuck uses TOAST?  But 7-zip cannot open, and neither can WinRAR.  Cannot be mounted using Alcohol 52% or Daemon Tools.  Cannot be burned by ImgBurn or Nero.  You can open it with ISOBuster, but extracting to a bin file results (again) in an unusable image.  Since i only have the free version of ISOBuster, i can't access the files in the image directly.  Anyway, i give up."
