1. ladda ner imagen

3. ladda ner dd for windows från http://users.erols.com/gmgarner/forensics/forensic%20acquisition%20utilities-bin-1.0.0.1034%20(beta1).zip 
4. flytta dd filerna till mappen där du har imagen
5. tryck win+R och skriv Diskmgmt.msc. Kolla vilken nummer din hd har. Imagen skall skrivas till en egen hd. 
6. Starta dos
7. gå till mappen med imagen
8. skriv:
dd if=tiger-x86-flat.img of=\.PhysicalDriveX
X är nummern för din hd. (använd 1 MB buffer så går det snabbare)
