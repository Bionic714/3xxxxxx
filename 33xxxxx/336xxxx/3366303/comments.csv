,Rasmuszombie,2005-08-09T20:27Z,"Thanks, allways glad when someone likes it :) we are right now investigating what to put into a scandinavian version so perhaps part 7 will be a special just like 5 but with our neighbours, Hรถst, Burning red and so on :)
So anyone with tips on Finlandic Psych is welcome since i only know about 3 bands doing it in Finland ! Must be recorded between 1966- 1979 :)"
