,Renaldo,2005-08-15T01:12Z,Many thanks Admin77!
,chronjohnson,2005-08-15T18:03Z,"We're all lovin' the uploads...remember when you're deciding whether or not to seed more, that the Pirate Bay's tracker is notorious for under-reporting peers."
,Admin77,2005-08-15T22:10Z,"Yes, I know the resolution is lower that the dvd, but remeber that this is an old tv-show so the picture quality on the dvd isn't that much greater :-)
I'm goint to do my best to upload the rest, but I have crappy upload speed so I can't seed more that 1 or 2 at the time."
,Cadiper,2005-08-15T22:38Z,Does someone have the other seasons? I love the show and but I only got the first season!!
,Admin77,2005-08-15T23:40Z,"I have season 2, but I was planning on seeding season 1 first."
