This French software is used to block the internal clock of a shareware limited to 30 days (or less) of use. Cracklock blocks the internal clock of the software sharewares and made in kind so that the days of use does not deduct itself any more, one can thus say that you have a complete version instead of a version limited to a few days of test. (Generally the shareware are limited to 30 days of use)."
