4/6 Tony Benn on Democracy

This week's big idea is democracy, with former Labour MP 
Tony Benn giving us a potted history and explaining his own 
philosophy. Benn is a passionate, articulate speaker and 
obviously enjoys himself debunking "myths", such as the 
suggestion that an elected parliament is the same as a 
democracy. And it will come as no surprise to hear that he 
has controversial views on subjects such as immigration. 
But the programme is seriously marred by its visuals: at 
best they distract attention from Benn's erudite words, but 
occasionally they're downright bizarre.
