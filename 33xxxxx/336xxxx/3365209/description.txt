Jan Johansson - Jazz pÃ¥ Svenska (Jazz in Swedish)

This album is a true classic. If you prefer to bring only one Swedish record with You to that desert island, I would recommend this one. It is considered to be a great jazz record and it is, for sure, but it is more than that. What Johansson does achieve here is indeed no small feat: He captures the essence, the soul, of Swedish folk music.

All tunes are old Swedish folk songs, interpreted without embellishment by Johansson, with just a tint of jazz coloring added.

Jan Johansson - piano, Georg Riedel - bass.

The album was recorded 1962-1964. 

Jan Johansson died at age 37 in a car accident 1968.
