Blodwyn Pig was formed when Mick Abrahams, the original guitarist with Jethro Tull, fell out with Ian Anderson over the band's musical direction. They didn't speak to one another again for something over 20 years. Tull went on to be megastars; Blodwyn Pig made a couple of albums and ran out of steam.

"Ahead Rings Out" was the first Pig album and as well as one of the best album covers ever, it also has some great songs based on heavy blues/rock riffs. With Abrahams on guitar and the remarkable Jack Lancaster on sax, Blodwyn Pig had a sound that has its roots in 60s R&B, but that no other band at the time could match.

Turn the stereo up loud and try "Its Only Love", "Sing Me A Song That I Know" and "Aint'Ya Coming Home Babe". And, I can't remember which track it's on, but try to ignore the rather feeble attempt at humour, which detracts from an otherwise classic album.
