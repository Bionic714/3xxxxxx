Big Mutha Truckers 2 begins with Ma Jackson being taken into police custody
  for tax evasion. The only way she can win her case is by hiring Cousin Jacob
  the most "fancy-talkin' legal fella" this side of Booger's Canyon. Players
  will be challenged to locate six jurors and raise the cash needed to bribe
  them to let Ma off by trucking, trading, wheeling and dealing.
