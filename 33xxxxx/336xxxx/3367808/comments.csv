,srcstc,2005-08-10T17:24Z,Lost connection overnight. It's back now!
,srcstc,2005-08-10T17:29Z,"Installation: (Sysadm) Firstly, disable or close any Anti-Virus software that you may have running. Before installing the ETK it will be necessary to install Sysadm. Insert Disc 1 into your CD-ROM drive and from the start menu open the ""RUN"" command and type D:WIN95BMWETKSETUP.EXE or navigate manually to the file, replacing D with the actual letter of your drive if different. Select your language for the setup interface and the Sysadm itself. Installation: (ETK) Run the newly installed Sysadm from the desktop shortcut or start menu. From within the Sysadm, select EPC or ETK on the toolbar and then Install. You will be prompted to select the market variation that you wish to have as default. Irrespective of where you are in the world I strongly recommend selecting Europe as this will allow access to ALL the world market variations (full options), which can easily be configured to your choice later within the programme. If you decide to install e.g. USA then you will have a restrictive range with options permanently greyed out and will need to uninstall and reinstall later should you wish to have access to the missing options. The password for installing a market variation other than Europe = berlin56. Select your country or language option for the setup (this is just for the setup interface only). Insert Disc 2 when prompted. (You may have Windows Autoplay search the disc, this will not affect the installation. Simply close the folder after the installation has completed) Select your language for the ETK configuration, leave all other fields blank."
