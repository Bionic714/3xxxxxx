,thecaptainofsweden,2010-11-17T20:08Z,"ashdevil77, I am really disappointed..
people has been complaining for three years, and you still haven't ever re-uploaded?
I am stuck @ 96.1%.
I will try to find the album, and make a torrent with all dope's albums as soon as possible.

I hope your further uploads will end up better. :)

,kanariezaf,2012-02-15T20:52Z,lol no I looked again at it and I see me last comment just above here isn't correct dope-motivation(4th song) and dope-easier(12th song) didn't fully!
