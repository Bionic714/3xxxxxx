A collection of programs I assembled from various places. All of these programs run from your USB flash drive without any install. Included apps include: Firefox, Thunderbird, OpenOffice. There is even a portable Apache webserver with a copy of MediaWiki. The setup also includes TrueCrypt so you can make an encrypted volume for sensitive files.
