,Cr3am,2005-07-29T16:02Z,yeah its the right one!
,cnasius,2005-07-29T19:38Z,"anyone who has tried this yet? it seems a bit odd that this file is ~700 megabytes smaller, as lane0185 mentions..."
,Mynthon,2005-07-30T01:09Z,"I've been trying to install this in to a dual-boot configuration with WinXP, but I've had no luck so far.

When I try to start the installation process from windows, an error message is shown:
""setup.exe is not a proper Win32-application"" or something...

Setup starts ""normally"" when I boot from dvd, but I had no luck this way either. I made a empty partition (10 GB) for this, but apparently is not enough for installation because ""not enough space for installation"" -message appears.

How much empty space does it need?"
,Thorlord,2005-07-30T02:48Z,i find it odd that there is even a 32bit version of this as microsoft has stated that the new OS dubbed longhorn is going to be 64bit only.
,coyote94,2005-07-30T08:44Z,Where is the key?
,coyote94,2005-07-30T08:46Z,Did not want to ask 3X. Oh well.
,lart,2005-07-30T14:42Z,it's the same size as the package in the winbeta irc channel so I have to say yes this is the right size
,Creaper,2005-07-31T10:20Z,Hmmm... what is password for guest and administrator?????
,mvickers03,2005-07-31T14:51Z,ime sure i read that the final release will be both 32 and 64bit 
,frasse53,2005-08-01T17:12Z,"Probably much smaller then the 32-bit version because the 64-bit version must be stripped from many drivers not available for 64-bit. 

Vista lack support from many vendors of 32-bit drivers, but I suppose you should consider you're selfe very lucky if you have drivers for Vista 64-bit.

Finally, yeh it's is correct, the 64-bit version is much smaller."
,christerhoglu54,2005-08-06T18:15Z,Vet ni att Windows Longhorn inte är grattis det kostar 30 dollar att köpa beta versonen det för att dom ska stjärnapengar på programet fast det är Beta
