Kerio Personal Firewall (KPF) helps control how your computer exchanges data with other computers on the Internet or local network. Kerio Personal Firewall is designed to protect any Windows PC that is connected to the Internet using DSL, cable, ISDN, WiFi or satellite modems.
Professional and corporate users residing behind a perimeter firewall such as Kerio WinRoute Firewall, would still benefit from using Kerio Personal Firewall on their computers. Kerio Personal Firewall prevents individual computers from attacks initiated by other internal users or compromised systems. It is also advisable to have Kerio Personal Firewall on every notebook for remote workers who connect to the Internet from unsecured locations.
