  4x4 EVO 2 takes the real-world dynamics and cutting edge graphics 
  from the original game and adds a variety of new twists and turns, 
  taking off-road racing simulations to the next level. Simmers will 
  have a chance to purchase one of 70 vehicles from 10 different 
  manufactures for use in intense, pedal-to-the-metal, off-road 
  rallies. In addition to individual racing, 4x4 EVO 2 gives virtual 
  drivers the chance to join a factory race team or 4x4 club to 
  participate in an assortment of exciting missions that involve 
  exploration and adventure. These various missions will take players 
  on a rowdy ride through locations so realistic and alive that they 
  will have to watch out for animals, traffic and other animated 
  dynamic objects.  

  Offroad Action  
  Taking the term "off road" to the extreme, gamers can drive anywhere 
  within each of the 15 gorgeous vast areas which replicate zones from 
  painted deserts to treacherous mountaintops to tropical island 
  chains. A race course consists of checkpoints strewn along the 
  countryside. Drivers choose their own paths while negotiating 
  whatever terrain lies between Point A and Point B.  


  We tested this game on a developer XBOX, and it works.  Since there is 
  no mod chip yet, we have no idea if this release will work on retail 
  XBOXes when/if a mod comes out.  However, now that there is a release, 
  a modchip developer will be inclined to get our releases to work, so 
  we think a future mod will work with this release. 

  If a game is small enough to be burned to a CD, you can burn it to  
  either a CD or DVD, at your option, using the same ISO file.   
  The Xbox does not use media checks like the PS2.  

  When burning to a CD, if your CD burning program has an option,  
  choose "MODE1/2048", exactly as if you were burning a PC CD-ROM. 
  We recommend PrimoDVD for burning Xbox for both CD and DVD, but  
  all CD writing software besides Clone CD should work fine. 

  From our experience, the retail Xbox can only read DVD-RWs 
  and CD-RWs, so if you want to be sure that these will work 
  with a future mod, we recommend burning them to Rewritable 
  discs. We have heard reports of the retail Xbox reading some 
  types of DVD-R discs, but we have been unable to verify this.
