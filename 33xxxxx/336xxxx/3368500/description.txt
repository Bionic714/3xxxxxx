»Thanks for the latest K. Schulze and Wahnfried CDs. I was very pleased with these CDs. Great music, probably the best after Mirage. It is heavenly music and a pleasure to play in my radioshow. Specially the Wahnfried!!!«
(M. Vance, radio, Belgium)

»House of India ist eins der der schönsten Stücke, die ich seit langem gehört habe; mit seinen leichten und langen Sequenzer-Läufen erinnert es mich ein wenig an The Art of Sequencing...«

 ... With a nice atmosphere I went into the House of India and I heard the next surprise. ... Everybody knows Klaus Schulze is behind Wahnfried. I admit the last piece is great. All the best ideas were taken from the previous tracks and played together in a soft atmosphere. It brought me almost an ecstatic quarter of an hour. It's great that I can always get it again.«
(A. Lason, translation from "Estrada i Studio", Poland)
