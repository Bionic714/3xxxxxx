,Mean76,2005-08-14T11:02Z,what program do u use to burn this type of files?
,wilzone,2005-08-14T19:01Z,"Open the file named ""xpdvd-chappelle-fwiw-ntsc.complete.001"" with WinRar and extract the image file. Mount the .img-file with daemon and use your favorite program for burning. I prefere nero."
,maddcamel,2005-08-14T21:13Z,"What I did was I used WIN Rar to decompress the file.  Which you can find if you google WIN RAR.  Then I already had DVD Decrypter on my computer, so when I right clicked on the decompressed file it said would you like to burn with DVD Decrypter.  So DVD Decrypter burned that image file for me.  And if you want to find DVD Decrypter just google it and I am sure you will find it.  Any other questions drop me a line, oh yeah, nice rip wilzone, good looking out!"
,ahungrymidget,2006-02-03T10:24Z,Please seed! Took forever to find and will take forever to download .... (?>?)
,ahungrymidget,2006-02-07T15:52Z,WTF? There's no fuckin file extension on these fuckin files. I tried Extracting with fuckin WIN rar and it says Im missing the stupid file that I already got although it hadds .r00 to the end every time 
,ahungrymidget,2006-02-07T15:57Z,Correction to comment previously posted : Adds* instead of hadds*

,busta69873,2007-06-18T15:56Z,"Another way to get this is to unrar the .001 file, and then rename the .img file to .iso, then burn the video_ts file to a dvdr with nero. That way, you don't have to download a whole bunch of extra software. "
,busta69873,2007-06-18T15:58Z,"Oh and BTW, I've been seeding this at 30mbps for like a week and a half, so why are people complaining about the speed?"
