PLOT:

Comedian Dave Chappelle does what he does best in
this outrageous and hilarious standup performance
which allows him to really push the envelope and
go even farther than he does on his TV show. Taped
in San Francisco at the famed Fillmore, Chappelle
lets loose on such topics as black celebrities
what it's like to have raunchy fans of his TV show
approach him while he's trying to enjoy Disneyland
with his kids, Michael Jackson, Kobe Bryant and
crackheads, of course
