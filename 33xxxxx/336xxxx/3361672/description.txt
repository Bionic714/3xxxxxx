Danish group from late sixties/ early seventies. This is a reissue of their 1972 LP 
Blomsterpistolen / Vol.2, which was their 1968 debut-lp "blomserpistolen", ("the flowergun") and their second lp from 1969 Vol.2 put together on one lp. Some lyrics on the first album are in danish, on the second album they sing in english. The music is psychedelic progressive rock with a strong blues influence (particulary on the second album), with a nice stoned vocal-performance and dreamy sound-effects.
