unfortunatly i only got 5 of those dvd´s, 1 episode each
there seem to be 26 episodes
also they got some pretty strange titles

this one fex. is called "testpilot paul foster" and seems to be the 2nd, original called "COMPUTER AFFAIR"

if you guys like it... post it & i´m gonna rip the other 4

i also would appreciate it if someone could tell me i´m right/wrong about the real name of this episode





ahh... ya... if someone got the other parts... i REALY would like to have them as well...
