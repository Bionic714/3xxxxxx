----------
Wes Montgomery plucked the strings directly with his thumb. He devised chord and octave techniques for the instrument and made them a central part of his solo style. He is famous for the warmth in his tone and every solo is a statement. As a jazz guitarist, he is simply one of the best ever and when he made his impact it proved to be massive, and permanent.
