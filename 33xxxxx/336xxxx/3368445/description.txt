Description from geenstijl.nl:
This 'movie' is a part of this post. The flash animation was made by a very stupid Dutch student called Dicky Thijssen. There was quite some media outrage regarding his production. We traced the origins of this flash file and the original producer. The movie is here for archiving only (and to learn about the big gaps in Dutch WWII history education). We strongly disaprove of his actions. In The Netherlands there has been quite some media attention. The maker 'Dicky' says he is very sorry.
