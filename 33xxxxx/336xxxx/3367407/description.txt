Detroit bluesrock from 1970. Catfish was Bob "Catfish" Hodges first band that lasted from 1969-72. Hodge is a bonafide american blues legend and here he is in fine form. This is hard blues mixed with a healthy bit of rocknroll. A title like " Get hig, get naked, get down" and a few stoned geetarsolos suggests the dude smoked a bit of this and that. ^_^ Most of his early albums have been out of print and are hard to get, but this one was re-released a few years back.
