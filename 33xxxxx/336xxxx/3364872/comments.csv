I get this info from what someone is selling on ebay it has a list of every episode for SMDM as well as TBW.

I should have mentioned it.. it hasn't.. :-(( Actually, I downloaded it just for that reason, but no tv episode was available, I took this movie.. They must have integrated these effects later on (in the series).
If you're eager to hear that sound only, the torrent isn't probably worth it. But it's a stylish 70's (or 80's?) movie, I enjoyed it. But as far as I remember, the pilot (0x01 - Cyborg) was better.."

I'll try to come up with the file later tonight."
