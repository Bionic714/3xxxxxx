Rip Notes
---------
Chapter V marks the return of one of the biggest-selling rock groups in America
today. Recorded at Allaire Studios in Shokan, NY and at the band's Springfield,
MA rehearsal space, the CD was produced and mixed by David Bottrill (Peter
Gabriel, Mudvayne, Godsmack). Staind is back in a huge way!

Enjoy.
