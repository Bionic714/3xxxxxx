,riccogrosse,2007-11-18T19:52Z,Thanks...
,deanvendetta4,2008-06-30T10:22Z,ok i have a noob question. how do i seed?
,bay-o-net,2008-07-11T18:25Z,To seed: just leave your downloading software open(when the little icon for it is showing at the bottom right of screen)either utorrent or whatever you have. And when you have finished downloading the album dont delete it from your utorrent leave it there and it will seed on its own(it will say SEEDING next to the album) As long as utorrent is running then you will be seeding!
