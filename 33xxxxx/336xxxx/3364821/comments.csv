At first I had some trouble with the ratDVD format, but it is simple. No need to convert anything, just download the RatDVD software and install in the comp. It works as a codec and then Windows Media Player instantly starts to recognize the format.

At least this is how it worked for me.  :))

It's perfect, thank you thank you thank you!!!"
