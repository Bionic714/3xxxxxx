This is a great (short) feature about 9/11 and the war in Afghanistan, written in 2002, and printed in the observer newspaper in the UK. It's probably unlike any satire you've read - it's not dismissive, but intelligent and true. It satirises Terrorism, War and our own hypocrisy. 

And it's funny. 

Written by Chris Morris and Armando Iannucci (The Day Today, Brass Eye, both excellent TV news satires)
