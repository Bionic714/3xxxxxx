,drjayden,2008-01-20T01:14Z,"Well, thing is, this installer's missing..
A. The Movies.
B. The Music.

The first one's useless anyways, and the music can be gotten around, just gotta adjust the ThemeMD.INI file a bit. Along with downloadable C&C music, you can stick your own music in there too.

And.. It's just 3cds btw.

Only bad point about this installer's that it won't register as installed to the Terrain Expansion mappack :(

Ah well, can't have best of everything."
