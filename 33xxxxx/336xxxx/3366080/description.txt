  As the FIRST and ONLY game to combine the classic themes of chariot

  racing and gladiator fighting, Circus Maximus: Chariot Wars bring the

  raw excitement of survival racing to the majestic coliseum and arenas

  of the Roman Empire. There is no other game like it! 



  * Start a race with complete control over the chariot team or let

    auto-drive steer while you bludgeon. 



  * Set up two-man teams with up to four players for serious co-op

    racing action. 



  * From the sands of Alexandria to the glorious Circus Maximus of Rome,

    you'll span the Roman Empire in seven cinematic environments and 19

    bloody tracks. 



  * Select from 22 unique characters, all from exotic tribes and lands

    scattered throughout the empire. 



  * With hundreds of driver, warrior, horse and chariot combinations,

    you'll find the perfect team for total domination. 



  * Choose from arcade, multiplayer, career and training modes. Though

    the styles are different, the goal is the same: race, fight and

    live to ride another day. 



  * Upgrade your team, unlock new options and collect dinari with every

    race you win. 



  * In the end, the glory of Rome rests in your hands. With multiple

    power-ups, special moves and deadly weapons, the tools are there

    - you supply the courage.
