,plagio,2005-08-11T13:48Z,"This is a mess but you can make it work.

There are three folders, CD1, CD2 and SAMPLE.

In CD1 you have lords of dogtown.cd1.bin and lords of dogtown.cd2.bin.

In CD2 you have lords of dogtown.cd1.cue and lords of dogtown.cd2.cue.

Simply put cd1.bin and cd1.cue in the CD1 dolder and you are done.

When watched with VLC the bin has no sound but if you burn the image it works BUT there is another issue.

I have used NERO and when I selected the relevant .cue file it told me that ""can not open l.o.d.pv.cd1.bin"".

I have therefore renamed the file lords of dogtown.cd1.bin into l.o.d.pv.cd1.bin and it worked.

The result are two video CD. The picture quality isn't the best but I have seen worst. The sound quality is all right.
