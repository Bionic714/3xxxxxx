Release Notes:

You can't help but smile when you think of Smash Mouth and the group's upbeat,
infectious and summery sound. So fans will be smiling from ear to ear with the
release of the band's first greatest hits collection. All Star Smash Hits
(Interscope/UMe), released August 23, 2005, features 20 original Smash Mouth
recordings -- most of its singles and fan favorites plus memorable movie
tracks making their Smash Mouth album debuts.

With Smash Mouth's 5th studio album, Old Habits (to be released for the 2005
holiday season), All Star Smash Hits brings together the best of the band on
record to date. Issued simultaneously is The Best Of Smash Mouth edition of
20th Century Masters/The DVD Collection, a DVD compilation presenting five of
the band's most popular music videos digitally remastered in audio and video.
Highlighted is the 1997 Billboard Pop Video of the Year for "Walkin' On The
Sun," directed by McG (Charlie's Angels).

Smash Mouth was formed in San Jose, Calif., in 1994 by lead singer Steve
Harwell, guitarist Greg Camp, bassist Paul De Lisle and drummer Kevin Coleman.
After a summer festival gig with No Doubt and Beck, the band made a
spectacular debut in 1997 with Fush Yu Mang, the double platinum Top 20 album,
which spun off the #1 Modern Rock hit "Walkin' On The Sun" and Top 30 Modern
Rocker "Why Can't We Be Friends" (also featured on the BASEketball
soundtrack). All Star Smash Hits adds the album's "Flo" and "Beer Goggles."

1999's triple platinum smash Astro Lounge went Top 10 thanks to the catchy
"All Star," which hit #4 Pop and #2 Modern Rock (and was heard in both Mystery
Men and Shrek), as well as the Top 10 Pop "Then The Morning Comes." Also
representing Astro Lounge are "Diggin' Your Scene," "Waste," "Come On, Come
On" (featured in Snow Day) and the Top 30 Modern Rock "Can't Get Enough Of You
Baby" (featured in Can't Hardly Wait).

With drummer Michael Urbano joining in 2001, the band lent its ska-punk garage
vibe to the Monkees' Neil Diamond-penned '60s hit "I'm A Believer" and emerged
with a Top 30 Pop hit that appeared in Shrek and on the self-titled Smash
Mouth, which reached the Top 50 and was certified gold. Smash Mouth also
included "Holiday In My Head" and "Pacific Coast Party," the latter heard in
the movie Pacific Coast Highway. Culled from 2003's Get The Picture? are "Hang
On" and "Always Gets Her Way."

Previously on soundtracks but premiering on a Smash Mouth album are "Every
Word Means No" (the Friends Again compilation for TV's "Friends"), "Better Do
It Right" (Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas), "Do It Again" (Me,
Myself & Irene), "Ain't No Mystery" (Austin Powers In Goldmember) and
"Getting Better" (Dr. Seuss' The Cat In The Hat).
