Toast?????????????"
,dromert,2005-08-11T14:42Z,"Hi Bifbof,
I made a disc-image with 'Toast' on a Mac. As far as I know, you can mount the disc-image on your desktop (with a variety of programs). It looks like the original DVD then. Then you can either make an exact copy of it (with any discburning program) or you can drag the VIDEO_TS folder as well as the AUDIO_TS folder into you discburning program and burn it in this way.
Good luck and say hello to Martha!"
