The third entry in Wes Craven's Dracula 2000 trilogy, more closely resembles what a direct-to-DVD film should be- namely just-short-of-box-office quality. Dracula III, directed by Cursed editor Patrick Lussier, is a tidy little tale of vampire-hunting, with a main character who curiously resembles Wesley Snipes' Blade: Wielding a scythe (cool hero weapon) and whip, this bad-ass- played stoically by Jason Scott Lee- slices up vampire vermin across a war-torn European landscape.

Jason London (the lesser London brother) serves as his sidekick, and the two get a little boost from hottie Alexandra Wescourt, who of course ends up being the love interest. Tons of blood, good action (the best fight is against a jester vampire on stilts) and even a lesbian vampire orgy (yeah, you read that correctly? wait! Come back. The video store is open late!), Dracula III: Legacy is the perfect film to grab when the New Release wall isn't doing it for you.
