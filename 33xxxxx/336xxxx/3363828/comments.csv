,mizzllat,2011-04-30T11:15Z,"I really wanted to watch this, and since the seeder problem hasn't gotten any better over the SIX years the torrent has been posted, I decided to go ahead and download it through hot-file, instead.  Takes a bit of extra time as I only use the free accounts, but in less than six hours I was able to sit down with my copy and enjoy.  Don't usually go the hot-file route, but since there is no seeding involved, sometimes it is the best solution going when you run into such problems like the one found here."

,Ozzen,2012-07-04T23:28Z,"it's in dual GERMAN/ENGLISH audio in default. Don't download, unless you understand german."
