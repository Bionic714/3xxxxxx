People who listen to the CDs available today of Jimmy Shand will most likely dismiss him as just another old codger playing dull old music on the accordion, and they will be mystified as to why he is a legend with a statue in his honour.

The reason for the legend is to be found in the great music made by himself and his band BEFORE 1960, everything afterwards is crap!

This torrent contains 2 CDs worth of the great music made by Jimmy Shand & His Band during the 1950s. It is ripped from vinyl and there are a few scratches so the audio quality is not of the finest but the MUSIC is!!!

If you wish to discover the REAL Jimmy Shand & His Band then this torrent is for you.

Enjoy!
