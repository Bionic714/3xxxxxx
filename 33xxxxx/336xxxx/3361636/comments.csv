,abilas,2005-07-27T14:35Z,"Best release out my a**! A 119 minutes movie on 266,71"
,BillMac,2005-07-27T17:23Z,"I have some great movies with only 260 MB. If you download the mp4 codec, and use VLC player, the quality is better than really good SVCD's. Of course the source determines the final quality, but an mp4 container is as good as any other, and uses much less file size. The new video players China is dumping use mp4, with up to 5 movies per gig!. "
,basaseal,2005-07-27T17:25Z,thanks to the uploader first. Mp4 is the new wave abilas get used to it. you think people would be happy the files are smaller therefore not killing your ratio. Idiot.
,kalasmannen,2005-07-27T18:31Z,Anybody got a good codec? It won't work in divx or q-time. And it's pixelated in VLC.
,kalasmannen,2005-07-27T18:36Z,"Nevermind, downloaded a newer version of VLC and it works."
,spank,2005-07-27T21:02Z,"i may have to redo this folks as ive just been informed that halfway through it go,s out of sync for some reason.sorry to those who d/loaded and got this problem i will fix and repost...again sorry"
,jamsie81,2005-07-28T00:32Z,"what do you need for this to work as i can only hear the movie and not see it.

i see people are recommending a newer version of vlc.  what is that and could you please post a link so i could get it as i really wanna see this movie

thanks a lot for any help guys"
,jamsie81,2005-07-28T00:35Z,sorry just tried nero and OMG the quality is amazing only thing is the sound and voice sync is way out
,Pepparspray,2005-07-28T09:43Z,I can't get it to work properly with any codec. The quality looks good in vlc but there's no sound. And in windows media player it only plays the sound :/ help?

,Jspec Sw20,2005-07-30T02:21Z,yeah the sync goes really bad like 40 minutes into the movie and stays like that throughout.  it would have been good if it didnt go out of sync.  i should have read the comments before i dl : /
,icab,2005-07-30T19:15Z,"like spank mentioned himself, the audio is out of sync at some point into the movie.  download his second version.  video and sound quality are pretty good for a CAM."
