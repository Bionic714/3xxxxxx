,bwgqsb420,2005-08-07T16:17Z,for some reason my subtitles don't work is there anything I can do?
,heyguys,2005-08-12T21:47Z,"My sound doesn't work, either.

To get the subtitles you need to find the option on your media player that says ""load subtitles"", then find the subtitle file in the Oldboy folder."
,phonkyd3jv,2005-08-14T09:32Z,"hey! I don't understand why some have problem with the sound, and it's not that complicated to get the subs to work.

first of all, use vlc player, or download k-lite codec pack(""all in one codecpack""). 

if you don't use vlc player, use media player classic, those two players is all you need. 
you can download all this at www.free-codecs.com.

if you have the subs in the same directory with the same filename, it works automaticly with mpc, with vlc you just right click on the screen when you've started the movie and choose ""subtitles"" -> ""track 1"".

thats it. I have never ever had any problems with any video or sound.
I have both mpc and vlc installed, and the k-lite codec pack. 

I also have the codecs ""quick time alternative"" and ""realplayer alternative"" installed, so all the quicktime and realplayer formats plays in mpc which means that I never need to install quicktime or realone players... it can't get any smoother."
,heyguys,2005-08-15T18:19Z,"Cool, thanks for replying. I downloaded everything you mentioned about the audio, and none of it worked did anything differently until I finally decided I might as well download mpc again (I thought I already had it installed). That did it.

In short: No sound? Download mpc."
[T],clownmonkey,2006-01-16T11:16Z,"random question: does anyone know of a DVD-authoring programme that handles a subtitle track? I've tried using DVDLab Pro and Videodub, but to no avail (the former doesn't understand .sst, the latter dislikes VBR audio) -- any other recommendations?"
,DarealRadexHEJOO,2007-02-10T14:34Z," Hey! now here' s a wierd, annoying problem with the sound: i got k-lite and use media player classic and all i can hear is the soundtrack and the background (city noise; rain etc.). No dialogs; no first planar sound effects. 

 help anyone?"

,choddeii,2007-04-22T20:23Z,Why can people rip these with english subs and movie as one file. Like some movie downloads have. I burn these as Avi file and play them on Divx compatible dvd player so I can watch it on my tv. What gives with the seperate sub files people?
,pandasoangry,2007-09-13T09:29Z,Not everyone wants English subs. Duh.
