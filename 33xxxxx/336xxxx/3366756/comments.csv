,hify,2005-08-07T19:55Z,"FYI, it's billed as a 'tank racing' game but I think the most fun is the Deathmatch and TeamDeathmatch.  But, that's just my opinion!

I suggest you read the fireing squad review, will save you a lot of head scratching about some of the quirks (Such as there is not barrel elevation...makes you use the terrain to angle shots up for down.  I.E. Makes you use a bit more skill! )"

It's not that bad!  It's not state of the art but if I can love BF2, with SLI and everything maxed out to it's best, and still be able to go back and enjoy this game too then that should tell you something about it's appeal.   It probably wont be for everyone but after playing BF2 non stop since it came out going back to this has been a nice break.  "

Anyway, the Firing squad review, while good, uses one of the worst maps in a lot of it's first screenshots. Go to:

The ones on normal land are better but even those do really do it justice.  The graphics may be outdated by todays standards but they're not bad and the game play is what really makes the game."
