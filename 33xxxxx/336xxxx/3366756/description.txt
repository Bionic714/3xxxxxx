Lets hope this works, my first and probably last torrent I'll ever actually make.

This is an older game, for those who don't know it.  It's fast, fun, and addictive.  Unfortunately since it's a few years old the player base had dried up.  There's still servers but not the masses of players that there used to be.  I just reinstalled it and had forgotten how fun it was.   

I'm trying to inject some freash blood into the game, as I seriously doubt LongBow has sold any copies in a quite some time....perhaps this will drum up some customers because as it stands the game is just dying a slow death mainly due to LongBow being an indy dev/publisher it's advertising was mostly by reviews on games sites...not a game you would normally find in a store.  Mail order/download etc.

Give it a shot!  If you like MP games and like fast paced arcade games then this is for you!  What have you got to loose? :)

As always, if you like this game BUY IT!  Please!  It's only 20 bucks!

Torrent contains Alcohol 120 image, no protection as far as I can see. Also contains the latest patch and community content patch (Extra Maps, sounds etc
