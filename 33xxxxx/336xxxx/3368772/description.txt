"Bliss was recorded and released in 2000, but was many years in the making: Lily-Rose was born in between the start of Vanessa's third album and its completion. 

This is the first album where Vanessa writes her own lyrics and music and produces and arranges. She did work with other musicians, most notably, M. Up and coming at the time, Mathieu Chedid was courted by Vanessa after she heard his songs on the radio and loved them... thinking he was a girl. 

Other contributors  Frank Langolff, of the M&J and Variations albums, wrote the music for "Commando." In one of the photos, you can see him touching Van's chin tenderly. Gerry DeVeaux, Lenny Kravitz's cousin, makes another appearance as a lyricist on a Vanessa album, writing for the "La La La Song." Bruce Witkin plays bass on many songs; he was the bassist for the band Kids back in the eighties, with Johnny Depp on guitar. Johnny Depp wrote the music for "St. Germain" and "Bliss," and played lead guitar on "Firmaman." He also photographed Vanessa for the cover, and altered it in Photoshop. "
