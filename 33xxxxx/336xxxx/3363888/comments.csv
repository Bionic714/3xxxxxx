,EMAILMEN0W,2008-01-31T08:36Z,"Okay, it took a while, but I finally figured out how to open it.  Download the latest of Daemon Tools and use that program to open the file with the extension ""CCD.""  Walah!  It works!  But the serial number... where in the world is that!?"

,vipersemil,2008-04-08T21:20Z,"to find the keygen just open with daemon tools, and go to My computer > the fake cd-rom daemon just created, rightclick > Explore, and there's a folder called _crack_.

Can someone translate the ""helpfile"" for me? I just have some wierd chars."
