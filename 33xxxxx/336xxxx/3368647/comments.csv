,shady78,2005-08-14T00:58Z,trainers are basically gameshark codes built right in to your xbox you can download them then ftp to your xbox and alll you have to do is activate them on xbox then play games with cheats
,shady78,2005-08-14T01:01Z,i have another question i use gr torrent and have cable internet but it only lets me upload at 100 kbs when im capable of 100mb/s does anybody know how to tweak my settings so i can upload faster
,shady78,2005-08-14T12:51Z,i just dont get it if i use kazza or win mx or other bullshit progrsms like that i can upload/download anyware from 300/to 500 kbs with g3 torrent and several other bit clients i can bearly break 100
,davidtr,2005-08-14T19:29Z,did you happen to try Azureus?
,shady78,2005-08-15T00:11Z,its the same ive tried different ports and all it still only lets me do just a lil over 100 like 103 - 107
,shady78,2005-08-15T00:13Z,whats even worse is i can download from web pages at like 700 to 800 you know like i was downloading azureus at 749 this is horshit shouldent i be able to pull the same with these bit clients
,chronjohnson,2005-08-15T06:28Z,"You should restart your computer, open no programs save a web browser, and go here http://performance.toast.net/default.asp?allservers=1&checkid=  Tell it to do an upload test...I tend to select the toast.net server.  That will tell you your true UPload speed(not the 700+ speed you download with).  The number will be in kbits, so you divide by 8 to get the kB/s rate.  It's very possible you have 1 mbit upstream limit, which would cap you at just above 100 kB/s."
,shady78,2005-08-15T13:05Z,"im gonna check right now but like i said i can upload in kazaa and winmx 300kbs to 500kbs
shouldent i be able to do this with a bit client"
,shady78,2005-08-15T13:24Z," UPLOAD Speed Test Results


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You uploaded 1,059,140 bytes in 14 seconds.  Your upload speed is 605 kbps.
this is what i got so i should be able to upload at 605 kbs this is 6 times more than i get with all these bit clients can sombody tell me how to fix"
,chronjohnson,2005-08-15T17:47Z,605 kbps is 75.625 kB/s dude.  I don't know how to explain that any more than I already have.
,chronjohnson,2005-08-15T17:49Z,"Kazaa and WinMX, being shitty programs, try to send out more data than your internet connection allows.  This results in the display showing a higher upload rate than what is actually going out.  Azureus, however, being heady, knows what's what, and if data isn't going out it stops trying to send it."
,shady78,2005-08-15T20:17Z,well i upload more than 75 isent there a way to tweak my modem to allow more
,>Flanders<,2006-04-06T20:28Z,"is this the hole game?
