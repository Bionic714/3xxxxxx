,cdma2006,2006-03-02T09:22Z,"It has 16 RAR files with different names. However, inside the RAR, all files have the same name. So if I unpack all 16 to the same folder, they just keep getting overwritten. Could someone tell me how I should burn this on to a CD/DVD? 


Thanks.

,genom,2007-01-01T12:57Z,"Is there still somebody seeding towards 100%? I'm hanging at 92.1%.  Should I give up?

and

The similiar torrent with an additional iso (1,5GB in total); is it just for convinience? Would I encounter the same problem with that one?

Thanks"
,Mrwager,2007-05-23T04:24Z,Great torrent; all you do everyone is extract the files 'here' and all the files will come together as an 'iso' image. Then all you have to do is burn the image using nero burning rom or something similar. One problem your data cd needs to be over 700mb as the file is like 772mb! Anyway good luck and thanks to the catcherman; i love a game of chess
