Tenacious D: Kyle Gass (vocals, acoustic guitar); Jack Black (vocals, guitar). Additional personnel includes: David Grohl (guitar, drums, background vocals); Warren Fitzgerald, Ken Andrews (guitar); Woody Jackson (sitar); Andrew Gross (strings); Page McConnell (keyboards); Steve McDonald (bass); Alfredo Ortiz (percussion); John King (echoplex). Recorded at The Boat, Silverlake, California. If you never caught their short-lived TV show, you'll probably be most familiar with Tenacious D through the appearance of singer Jack Black as the bile-spitting music geek in the film HIGH FIDELITY. The sarcastic humor Black employed in that movie is a clue to the sound of his duo Tenacious D. With his partner Kyle Gass, Black digs into various areas of rock mythology and skewers them in fine comedic style. Whether he's delivering a mock-metal ode to heavy metal hero Ronnie James Dio in the appropriately titled Dio or indulging in too-outrageous-to-be-crass single-entendre sexual humor on Kielbasa, Black's humor is always spot-on. While his no-holds-barred approach may be too much for some, those with a taste for the tasteless will find unending laughter in this disc.
