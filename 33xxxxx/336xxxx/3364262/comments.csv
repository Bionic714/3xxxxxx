,Archer_DRAW,2008-08-10T14:41Z,"I wanted just ONE ( 1 ) song :

""673. Trick Pony - Pour Me Another Shot Of Whiskey.mp3""

- so I DL it.

Turns out it's got the modern disease :

IT'S CUT AT THE END !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Kinda ruins it completely !

What's the point of having a tune that's CUT SHORT !? !? !?

I for one wouldn't care to walk around w. ""bits and pieces""

It's so stupid!
It's hard to believe anyone actually can be that stupid!

Why is it that every other audio track here is CUT SHORT ?

I just don't get it.

Is there even a reason ?"
,Archer_DRAW,2008-08-10T14:43Z,"BTW, I think the title is faulty: it's
""Pour Me"""

,Vevaren,2008-08-26T22:43Z,"Got to have this!  With my connection I guess it will take be about 3 weeks to download it, but got to have it!  Thanks! :)"
,robonut1,2008-11-06T06:35Z,great compilation of older country with a lot of stuff that is kinda hard to find. however a lot of the songs are named oddly so when they get imported it requires a lot of editing. also there are quite a few songs that aren't full length. thanks for the download it really expanded my collection.
,Hedsjodt,2008-11-24T10:27Z,"Lechtard...

Terri Gibbs: I had The Best of... when it came out on cassette about a hundred and twenty six years ago.  It was a huge favorite.  

Unfortunately, it was lost in the divorce.  I have been trying to obtain this recording ever since.

Please tell me that you have the entire album!

Please tell me that you download the whole thing or, that, you will contact me reference my getting a copy!
