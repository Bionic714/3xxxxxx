,McKack,2005-08-12T05:47Z,Sweeeeet... I've missed a Wipeout-like game for years. Ballistics was too straight forward and short. Let's hope this is a more diverse game. If anyone know of any similar games for PC I'd like hear of it.
,freeze2,2005-08-12T16:47Z,anyone played this yet? worth the download?
,McKack,2005-08-12T19:38Z,We don't know what you like... You have to try it for yourself. I personally like it so far.
