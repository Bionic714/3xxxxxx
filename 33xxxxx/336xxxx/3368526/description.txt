Powerdrome features futuristic racing in its purest, most distilled form:
  no weapons, no gimmicks - nothing but raw-power versus sublime control.
  A game that rewards those gamers with real skill, but even the losers will
  be left gasping for more.

  Into this intense racing formula are thrown 12 heroic riders, risking all 
  on the Powerdrome hypersonic racing circuit - the Galaxy's ultimate rush.
  Pushed by ramjet engines to impossible speeds, they ride the knife-edge
  between victory and oblivion.
