,KConrad,2005-07-26T00:25Z,"How about some info about, for example, WHAT units, and where they came from?"
,infektion,2005-07-26T20:25Z,"Gah, well, I wrote loads of info at first, then it whined over 'invalid tracker' and all of it got lost :(

Ok, first off, it's just the 6 extra units, plus the 40 you get in the latest patch.

If you're not satisfied with the torrent have a look at www.tauniverse.com - there's EVERYTHING you'd ever want."
,KMHP,2005-07-27T16:12Z,"What he means when he says 1500 units, KConrad, is that 1500 is the maximum amount of units you are able to build in game(Skirmish Only). It's a simple edit of the total.ini file. This amount can be adjusted to whatever you want. This game is great though and I recommend if you can even find it now to buy it it'll probably be a fiver in USD."
