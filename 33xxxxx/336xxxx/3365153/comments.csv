Tried on CD player and DVD player, but the DTS flickers on and off on my amp"

it's likely your DVD player, or more likely, your stereo are doing some sort of upsampling or post processing on the PCM stream. my stereo kit did the same thing until I turned off bitmapping on my PS3. try and turn off all the post processing or surround effects on your stereo box and you may or may not be fine. could be your stereo just doesn't like the whole... DTS thing. who knows?"
