This documentary (among lots of other things) tries to give some insight into the policies stated by the think-tanks behind the Bush administration. Several of them are being interviewed and they are quite frank about their radical right wing plans for the US and its foreign policy.

People who are interested in the policies the US government really have should see this documentary (those who aren't can keep on watching the TV news and reading the mainstream newspapers).
