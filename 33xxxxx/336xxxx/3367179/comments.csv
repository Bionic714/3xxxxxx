,taxcut,2005-08-08T17:53Z,One of six more or less anti-American movies run by the state controlled Swedish Television this summer. http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=37437&a=427936
,nummer_tolv,2005-08-08T18:21Z,Tackar! Jag kunde inte se denna när den gick på SVT så jag tackar och bockar! :-)
,annors2,2005-08-08T18:32Z,"It's funny how showing what these organizations say themselves is classified by some as anti-american... it's their own words. 
Anyone who hasn't been heavily indoctrinated would of course appreciate when journalists do what they are supposed to, namely a critical view the government. But clearly, in these right wing times this is now judged by some as anti-american.
The public TV networks (like BBC and SVT) show what may be considered (by the right) anti-american or left etc. This is because everything that doesn't support Bush and his government is now considered as anti-american. 
Public TV networks can in general remain more independent due to the fact that they are not dependent on support by advertising and can therefore retain a more impartial viewpoint. "
,gregorius,2005-08-08T18:37Z,"more or less the entire world is anti american (the people) - anti american emperors, neocons etc. not american people - btw, more than half of the american people are against those nasty rulers..."
,Burning Red Ivanhoe,2005-08-08T19:43Z,"My pet bird is very antiamerican, he told me in my sleep that he wanted to kill bush with a hulahop-ring"

,Locobot,2005-08-09T23:41Z,Great documentary.  Amazing the leaps in logic that the bomber pilots take to rationalize their actions.  Little reason to believe that the Iraq war will end in our lifetimes.  
,annors2,2005-08-10T11:57Z,"yeah the pilots ignorance was impressive. I think they don't know what their bombs hit, it think they still believe that I hit that ""very important"" target...why would the army tell them the truth?
Impressive statistics for the ""smart"" bombs as well no? Out of 50: 50 did NOT hit their target and 42 hit civilian targets...That's what u get when you have a industry that regardless of quality of their product will get more and more money...turns to shit. Much like the soviet union now that I think about it, with their shit cars etc. 

I hope the Iraq war will not last for ever, it will stop when the American people stop it, when they protest more and more. I guess we'll see..."

,taxcut,2005-08-11T15:29Z,People around the world hate USA because it is the most successful of all nations.
,Jooohan,2005-08-11T16:53Z,No... PPL hate USA because they don't have any respect for other nations.
,taxcut,2005-08-12T18:04Z,"If America is so bad, why is it that people from all of Europe not to mention Asia move there? Why are so few moving the other way?"
,Kame_boy,2005-08-13T10:59Z,"taxcut:
People from all over the world move to places where they can live a day without getting shot at. 
America is not the only country that takes in foreigners, and when they do, its pretty hard to get to stay. Needless to say more, your argument goes down the toilet. 
And oh! Successfull?? Okay yes, if you think success is meassured by how many times a country can destroy the world with the nukes it has, okay then im with you. Or if you think it's meassured by how many other countries they've had war against, or how many dictators they have supported financially. Well then yes..  america would be the big winner.
People hate the US because their relatives (me included) have been killed by them, because they have been lied to and mostly because nobody can stop their triggerhappy frenzy from the outside, and nowadays not even from the inside, cuz the ppl is more or less brainwashed by the media.  "
,annors2,2005-08-13T20:29Z,Kame_boy: couldn't agree more.
,astro_nicke,2005-08-14T00:14Z,This is one important documentary that i think every human being with an open mind should see.
[V],vla108,2006-10-05T23:42Z,"Well taxcut explain to me why I have to leave my country in South America when I was a child to live in Sweden because my parents were Native Americans.

I like to tell you to go to hell but I will rather hope you go and read a book of history not written by the US right wing.

The success of the ruling class in America is paid by the poor people in the US and places like Iraq and so on, and on, and on.  

It came a time when the Roman empire grow so big that they could not control their own armies any longer and they become a dictatorship and the republic started to rotten from the inside until it faded. Well history repeats it self.

,xunaj,2006-11-29T03:00Z,pleeease seed....
,dethilva,2009-12-15T20:51Z,"Wow... talk about brainwashed. None of you know ANYTHING about what you are talking about. Do any of you REALLY think you're watching a movie that the USA didn't approve of??? It's a BBC documentary. Britain, America's ally. Hmmm... Brainwashed you say??? lmao"

,dannychris,2010-04-07T14:09Z,"Why We Fight is the title of a series of propaganda films that Frank Capra began making in 1942, with the aim of encouraging the American war effort against Nazism. Director Eugene Jarecki (The Trials of Henry Kissinger) has used the films as a commentary on the contemporary obsession of the American elite with military power. 

He also harks back to a speech by President Eisenhower, who, just before he left office, referred to the ""military-industrial complex"". Eisenhower was worried that too much intelligence, and too much business acumen in America, had become focussed on the production of unnecessary weapons systems. 

Since Eisenhower's time, everything has become much worse, as Eugene Jarecki describes it. The war in Iraq was made possible by a new range of weapons systems: a bomb called the ""bunker buster"" was dropped by stealth bombers on the first night of the conflict. 

Is American foreign policy dominated by the idea of military supremacy? Has the military become too important in American life? Jarecki's shrewd and intelligent polemic would seem to give an affirmative answer to each of these questions.


US Sucks man

We don\'t make policies.rn And if you think we elect those who do, you are wrong. Our counrty is dominated by two magor political parties that force feed us idiots for canidates, time after time. rn In fact, in most states we are only allowed to vote for certain parties, so most of us blue callor works have given up hope and stop voting.rn But we are the people of the US. Talk all you want about our gov. policies, but lay off our country as a whole.rnrn What the world does not need is more haters."

,Lobe44,2012-09-06T11:29Z,"Thanks for this, this is probably one of the most important and informative documentary's of the last 2 decades. Everyone should see this because this contains the truth as to what has been going on for the last 100 years in the U.S and how it has had grave affects on the rest of the world. I only wish it was longer so they could tackle the issue of corporate corruption in our pseudo democracy more. "
