[ End Notes ]

This is by far one of the most highly anticipated compilations of its time.  There are so many recognizable artists like Eminem with his track entitled ?Any Man? which was one of the only reasons I purchased this Compact Disc. 

The entire content of this CD cannot be compared to any other assemblage of any genre of music to my appreciative.

Respect this compact disc content.  

There was a Soundbombing volume 1 and 3, but they don?t compare to this release by any means. 

If you assembled the contents of volumes 1 and 3 and singled out tracks to make a single compilation to challenge Soundbombing 2, you wouldn?t come close to the musical entertainment factors released by the energy of Soundbombing 2.

Keep fit and have fun! ^_^
