FEATURES

 A Fully Immersive World: The world is completely alive as Hong Kong bustles with activity.  Day turns gradually to night and back to day. Clouds move across the sky and sunshine changes to rain. People fill the streets moving about their daily activities. 
Complete Freedom to Explore: Players are completely free to explore and "live" in Hong Kong. Work, sleep, move about, fight, gamble, and engage in many other activities. The streets are filled with virtually thousands of fully interactive characters. 
Solid 3D Fighting: Created by the same group that developed Virtua Fighter, Shenmue II includes an advanced fighting system with over 50 punches, kicks, holds, and combos ? the most developed fighting system for a non-fighting game.
