,Homer J,2005-08-13T19:59Z,"Varför tycker ""krutan"" att ettan är bättre?
"
,Divyx,2005-08-14T08:35Z,"If youre using NTFS capable operating system then you can convert to NTFS format and NO, converting from FAT32 to NTFS DOESN'T format your hd."
,krutan,2005-08-14T15:24Z,"Homer J: Tycker ettan är roligare för att själva storyn i ettan är bättre än i tvåan, skönare folk i staden, roligare jobb, och det är även lite svårare än tvåan, men det kanske beror på att jag lirade ettan först och kunde inte med spelet riktigt i början :) Ingen som vet om trean kommer snart? Vet att Shemue Online kommer men det är nog inte samma känsla."
,Homer J,2005-08-15T09:35Z,"Krutan: Jag är, som du förstår, nybörjare när det gäller shenmue 2. Jag satt härom kvällen och prövade lite, tycker inte du att styrsystemet är lite segt? eller klumpigt är ett bättre ord. Snubben går ju in i stånd och folk hela tiden. "
,ibbi360,2005-08-15T13:32Z,Yehh found out you can change it to NTFS however once you changed it you cannot change it back to FAT32. I dont know the Pro's & Con's of both sytems so dont know if i will be changing. 
,Initial_D,2006-04-08T22:54Z,"Shenmue 2 är världens bästa spel.
Den som klagar kan ju ta sig någonstans."
,the game of hill,2006-07-14T17:55Z,krutan: är deta spel typ som GTA?svara snälla.

,bolshakov,2007-03-10T13:34Z,I burn it but it doesn't work on my PAL XboX. Anybody tested it with PAL version ?
,hide_,2007-04-16T00:40Z,"This version doesn't work on pal, i have read it from another torrent site.
It's just NTSC it works on!
So if you have pal, don't download this.
I am searching for Shenmue 2 pal for myself but cannot find it anywhere."
,Kismeth,2007-05-06T00:59Z,Change your xbox mode in Enigmah from PAL to NTSC manually and it will certainly work... Had the same problem with Fight Night Round 3.

,erkmasterflex,2008-02-20T00:24Z,"after using the link on here to make it fit onto a 4.7GB DVD i kept getting dirty/damaged disc errors before I even saw anything other than.. LOADING....
if anyone knows why that happens and how to fix it please let me know. thanks :)"
,timogen,2008-05-17T14:27Z,"To anyone who's downloading this game, this one really works. I tested it with my modded xbox. I burned it using verbatim and imation d9 disks both failed. I got a loading and a dirty disk error message However, I did the ftp with my xbox and copied the file to my 120gig xbox harddrive and it works. I used flashfxp for ftp. If your xbox is modded it should have a program that could unrar the file automatically to your xbox's hard drive. My xbox has a ""complex tool"" program. I copied the file to my xbox's hd using ftp then use the ""complex tool's"" unrar feature. The game can be played from your dashboard's main menu ""Play Xbox Games from HDD"".This depends on your Xbox's dashboard. Just try to familiarize with your modded xbox's features.

,PraiseTheLard,2009-03-22T02:14Z,"Just started to download but I'm pretty sure I've d/l-d this torrent before.

I actually downsized the game from DVD9 to DVD5 by just resampling some WAV files that belonged to the arcade games that had 8-bit music. Then repackaged an ISO using some Xbox tool."
