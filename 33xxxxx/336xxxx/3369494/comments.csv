It works allright, but that is about all. You can NOT:
1 .add movies longer than approx 2h15 mins.
2. Save to ISO
Also, it does something nasty to picture, it flips it upside down. You CAN repair this with a .REG file on their site, but then all your other movies will be upside down now!
Also, I think the srt. file and the audio must be in some special format, because my first episode has just failed.
In other words, this software is like a posh WASP girl: Extremely prissy and precise, high maintenance, and if everything is not EXACTLY the way she wants it, she won't give you that hard-on ...

Still, it's also the only software that does what Nero Vision Express AND Avi2DVD can NOT do:
Have menus AND subtitling, subtitles subs BOTH!
Also in this, it mirrors the posh WASP girls: They were the only ones who looked good and smelled nice, give you a good blowjob AND carry an intelligent conversation before and after giving it ...

PS I ran the keygen AFTER, works fine. Keygen has hard to find OFF switch, though. Nasty if you don't like that crappy MIDI-music.

Be sure not to over write the original reg file, since otherwise its harder to return you other movies back to normal.
It does something to the FFdshow settings, in the registry, if you know how to work that, more power to ya.
It's easiest to keep them on the desktop and when ever you wanna use Super DVD Creator , doubleclick the 2nd one, after you're done, doubleclick the original one."
