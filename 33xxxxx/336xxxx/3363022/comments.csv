[V],GreyRaven,2005-07-31T14:08Z,In general any Torrent placed on the Pirate Bay should be writen in english to inform users what it is that the torrent is loaded with. Multi national sites are always in english :)
,MaeveConnacht,2006-02-15T21:12Z,All information should be written in Esperanto!

,Jeder,2006-09-30T11:32Z,"PL = Poland, if you dont know that, go educate yourself or something. I'm not Polish btw.
And i think 1 or 3 national torrents is nothing to complain on as long as they dont flood the place so the majority can just leave, after all this is a international site hence english is the main language used and seeked."
