-----------------------
"The Suicide Machines are back with their 6th studio album. This time around the
Detroit four piece is cranking it up a few notches with War Profiteering Is
Killing Us All. These are some of the heaviest, loudest and politically charged
songs the band has ever done. Brace yourself!"

Enjoy!
