If you enjoyed these as much as I did,  you should try some of his other works like Squee and Invader Zim :D

,zoobezee,2008-08-30T03:09Z,"I'm not much of the type to seed, however, this is a small program.
I'll be seeding for a bit, and thanks for the great addition to TPB."
,zoobezee,2008-08-30T04:06Z,"FOR THOSE OF YOU HAVING PROBLEMS OPENING THE FILE.
The files should have a strange name called
""Johnny the Homicidal Maniac #0_.CBR""
Just change the CBR at the end to RAR and you can extract the pictures using a decompression program like WinAce."
,MordorD,2010-02-23T13:22Z,"Instead of changing the extension, you could just use a Comic Book Reader program......"
,Skelly13,2010-11-30T07:01Z,hell yeah thanks man for the 3 Vasquez books
