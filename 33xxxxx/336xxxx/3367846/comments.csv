BUT

You have to have ""disc 2"" to continue. Unless you can find a patch, this torrent is worthless for use in the game."

,xJ3izzaros,2010-05-14T08:24Z,How to put this into the game???
,kotuwa,2010-10-24T20:27Z,"Correction 
======= 

The 2 tracks titles are wrong (swapped) 


""04.Your Teeth In My Neck.mp3"" is not ""Your Teeth In My Neck"". It is ""The Mummy's Shroud"". 
And 
""02.The Mummy's Shroud.mp3"" is ""Your Teeth In My Neck"". 

:)

jaya wewa!"
,kotuwa,2010-10-24T20:45Z,"And i think those MP3s can not put in the game. 
(Can put in User Tracks ;) 

All radio audio files in MY game folder are dfferent from mp3 files here. 

In the game, they are WAV (ADPCM intel codec) files. And they remain as a single file for a single radio chanel. 


So i think if you want to play the game with audio, just download a FILL rip. 
You can download full rip about 700mb. Or just missing audios abt 550 mb (with a risk) 


AUDIO is the main thing that affect GTA game size! 

GTA III - with audio 700mb, without 150mb. 
Vice City - with 1400mb, without 300mb. 
San Andreas - with 3.9gb, without 650mb. 

and without sounds the game is useless unless u r deaf! 

- 
ayubo wewa!"
,RS27,2010-12-31T12:02Z,can anyone tell how to insert these audio files in GTA 3?
