,urmamma,2005-08-01T01:58Z,Is there any subtitles in english or something?

Depending on your interest, it might be worth watching anyways.. its not every day you can observe 20 million ants devour a live chicken in minutes."

I'm really looking forward to watching this movie.  When I found this torrent I was downloading 4 other films on nature, but stopped all of them so that I can watch this one first.  At the moment there's no seed, but I do hope someone will help."

Although I don't speak German, it isn't difficult to understand what is happening. Many thanks again, and I'll seed whenever I can."
