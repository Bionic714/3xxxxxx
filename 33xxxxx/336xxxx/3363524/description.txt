NINA LIVE!
Nina Live in Concert (Phils, 2005)


It was a wondeful performance by Nina. It's a pity though that she performed only english covers for her concert, but they were great. I think she's a very good singer, with a nice voice. 

Also all songs are in english, since they are all live covers of some popular originals from the 90s. To know more about Nina please visit her official website.
