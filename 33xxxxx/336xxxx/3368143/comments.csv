,hakf,2009-05-28T20:59Z,"Jim Jarmusch is king! You should also see his film Dead Man, and as edp wrote, Coffee and cigarettes too. Those are the great films I have seen with him, and he has made many others that sure are just as good. But start with Down by Law :P"
,IHATERAP763,2009-12-15T12:07Z,"U R All crazy! How has nobody mentioned 2 of Jarmusch's coolest movies! Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai, and his latest, The Limits of Control"
,ns82,2010-06-06T14:23Z,"I apreciate the effort, Beksinski, but I have to mention the resolution, which is indeed ridiculous - 448x240"
