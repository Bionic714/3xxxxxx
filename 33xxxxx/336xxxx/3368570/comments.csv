,sof2er,2005-08-11T20:39Z,"Unfortunely PMDG gonna take 6/7 more hours and Piper Meridian will come 2morrow also with the PMDG..

They take really long, maybe the Concorde will come online today as it takes 2 more hours till completation, however about the PMDG im not sure if this is the same version or not...it says UPDATE 5 aug"
