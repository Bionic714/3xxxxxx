One of the most famous aircraft ever created, the Cessna 152 has touched almost every aviator at some point in their flying career.

Flight One has assembled a great team to bring this little aircraft to life for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This team includes:

Roger Dial - 3D Aircraft Modeling
DreamFleet (Lou Betti and Elmar Calbo) - Panel, Gauges, Documentation.
Jerry Beckwith - Flight Modeling
Aaron Swindle - Custom Sounds

This project is part of the Flight One initiative to help bring Microsoft Flight Simulator and other specialized tools to the forefront in computer based aviation training.

Have Fun
