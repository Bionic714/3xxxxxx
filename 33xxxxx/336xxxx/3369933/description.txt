Curb Your Enthusiasm - All seasons, all episodes

A complete collection of all episodes of all the 4 seasons made.

By and with Larry David, the co-creator of Seinfeld.
Larry is the guy that the "George" character was developed from!

If you liked Seinfeld, you'll love this! =o) In the same manner as the Seinfeld show sort of had 'no story' but still was full of interwoven plots and characters you got to know, the Curb.. episodes are (supposedly ;-) about the real life of Larry David's.

It however differs from Seinfeld in the sense that it's filmed in a semidocumentary way, rather than being set in a studio. The people we meet in the series are a mix of actors playing a part, but also 'real' moviestars acting themselves shows up.
