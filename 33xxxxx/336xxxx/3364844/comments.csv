,click4dylan,2008-06-02T13:44Z,"i hear you're all still having problems with this torrent? try mine, i mean it! you dont have to copy the patch over, or install 1.1 because there is not a single online server that uses it, and you won't be able to play online if you do! you will get an error saying ""your cl dlls client.dll differs from the server"" unless you use my torrent or don't use the 1.1 patch. and you don't need daemon tools or anything like that, all u need to do is unzip it and play! http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3911664/James_Bond_007_Nightfire_PC_FULL_with_online_by_click4dylan 

or just click my username! we also have a lot more seeds (thanks seeders! keep it up! i reformat a lot and it takes a lot less time to just redownload with my torrent than it takes to take out the ol' bond cds and go through that long install process)"
,bp13,2008-07-03T05:13Z,Level 2 is impossible! you disable the spot light generater she goes the guard comes you kill him take his keycard kill first 2 spot light people on roof then guard on porch all guards in the aera is dead and then the alarm goes off for no reason then you loose
,bp13,2008-07-03T05:17Z,"btw this works perfectley and the cut scenes do work,. it mentions when you download and install patch v1.1 that the cutscenes won't work becasue it requires a movie codec that windows operating systems dont come with. and it tells you the link to go to to download the codec (via windows update) some people may already have the codec and not know it but if the starting movie works all of them will. Great Torrent Works Perfectley!"

,NeedNewGame,2008-11-01T13:47Z,"i have downloaded this torrent and installed it but when i click on the icon on the desktop it comes up and says ""please insert the right CD""
i have tried it with both of them but nothing happens.

what should i do???"
,drdrei2002,2008-11-07T21:11Z,"okay; to avoid the whole ""insert disc 2"" dilemma, when you click the ""set up"" key and it is about to start installing, a box will appear asking you if you want to install ""icon"" and ""videos - 600 mb""; remove the checkmarks besides these two (do not install them), and then the install should work.  You can always add the movie folder from second part later"

,Phoenix-448,2010-03-20T08:57Z,"I've found many people here whining about the installation. I got the installation right and i can play it alright. Now, just follow these steps to install and play nightfire.

For this installation i prefer to use PowerIso. Download it from www.poweriso.com.

1. Download the torrent and open the download folder. There should be two .iso files, CD1 and CD2.

2. Open the CD1 with PowerIso. Doubleclick the setup.exe and exctract ""all the files to a temporary folder"" Now just start to install the files (ignore the marks in the ""movies"" and ""create a desktop shortcut""). Just copypaste the serial to the boxes.

3. At some point the installation program asks you to insert CD2. Now open the CD2.iso file and copy all the files to the ""clipboard"". Paste them to CD1.iso file. Replace the same named files and data. Now the installation should continue. At some point you have to insert the CD1 again. Now just close the both .iso files and start both of them again (make sure you don't save the changes!!!). Now copy all the CD1 files to clipboard and paste them to CD2.iso. Now you have succesfully installed the Game.

4. Go to the folder where you installed all the game data. Now open CD1.iso. Doubleclick the ""Crack"" folder. There should be three folders; ""1 Serial"", ""2 patch 1.1"" and ""3 NoCD Crack"". Open the ""NoCD crack"" and then open 1.0 version. Now just move the cracked ""bond.exe"" to the game installation folder what you opened earlier. Overwrite the original bond.exe and you have the game ready to play.

(You can only play it from the folder!!)"
,akilali45,2010-06-29T21:05Z,when i am trying to start the game its asking me to insert the right CD. I need help plzzzzzzzzz.
