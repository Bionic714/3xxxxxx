,thefunkyone,2005-08-09T13:15Z,yeah man. it keeps on skipping throughout the episode. maybe its the way it has been rard. its a shame because this is the only torrent of episode 6 I could find. please try and fix it?!?
,anyoneatall,2005-08-09T17:56Z,Yep. It keeps skipping a second ahead here and there... Many times actually. The entire show is about a minute shorter than it should have been because of it.
,thefunkyone,2005-08-10T14:22Z,please try and fix it?!? 
,thefunkyone,2005-08-10T14:23Z,"by the way, anyone know where I can get Ep7 as well?"
,thefunkyone,2005-08-12T11:02Z,"ok so there isnt a 7
Please sort this episode out jc? your the only person i can find thats thats torrented it!"
,`jc,2005-08-12T14:42Z,"Nothing I can do about the skips, I didn't encode it. Has to be a 6-ep run for the first UK season, else they wouldn't have put celebrities on."
