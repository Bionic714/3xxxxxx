,Smultronizer,2005-07-24T22:06Z,Could anyone tell me if there is another game that is quite the same as this? Something that is similar to Zelda Windwaker ocr this one. For those that haven´t played this game... You better play it. It´s one of the best games out there for Xbox. I´ve played it twice and that comes from someone that normally gets bored playing games for more than 10 minutes!! :-P
