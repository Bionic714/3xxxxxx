,eez,2005-07-26T23:27Z,"Stewie Griffin - The Untold Story (2005) AKA Family Guy The Movie actually consists of three episodes intended to air on FOX for Family Guy Season 4 (below)

4ACX05	Stewie B. Goode (Part I)
4ACX06	Bango Was His Name Oh (Part II)
4ACX07	Stu & Stewie's Excellent Adventure (Part III)

Some sites announced that this direct-to-DVD release was to be a thank-you to all the fans, from FOX - indeed, thank-you FOX for selling episodes instead of airing them.

With the original release of this 'floating around' for days before hitting the mainstream P2P scene, it makes you wonder who leaked it in the first place..

Pretty good is an understatement. Obviously not a true fan. IT IS REALY GOOD. Especially, for it being a movie, i have an attention spand of a mouse, iwatched the whole thing one shot. Can you think of any TV SHOW gone to movie and been successful??? I cant. Not like this anyways. And as for it being cut and paste of 3 episodes....good point, why pay when its ofr fans?

I think you can open the .rar file in winrar and test the archive and it will tell you the corrupt file.  Delete that file, then redownload the torrent.  You should have almost the entire thing with the exception of the corrupt archives.  Alternately you could just try downloading the torrent again to the same spot, the hash check should verify all the good pieces and then re download the corrupt ones.

I must say we are ignorant of this cartoon... Can anyone if the voice Stewie Griffin is done by the actor that played the humanoid robot on the original Star Wars movie or not? Thanks (please dont flame me gang... Im still smoking from my last attack for a question)

""they wrote it before they knew they were going back on-air to make more episodes, so you can tell that all of the characters do shit they wouldn't normally do blah blah blah""

you obviously don't know what the fuck you're talking about. and they didn't write ""it"" after the show was ""dead"", you tard. for starters, there is no ""it"", these are actually *three* episodes of the new season put together with a DVD-only intro and ending. and how can you say that they're doing everything the simpsons did and put it into one episode?! have you even watched the show? these guys (especially in the later episodes) are doing things that the simpsons writers don't have the balls do to. according to you the show has gotten worse, and yet the show has been getgin excellent ratings and this movie has been downloaded 130,000+ times and will generate great sales numbers when released. you are such a tool."

,prmdbr,2005-08-04T14:38Z,"samhain959:  WTF are you talking about?  First, I think I understand what you mean by ""based in reality"".  I think you mean to say that the show more closely mimicked a regular situation comedy when it first aired. You could or could not be right about this.  It depends on how you view sitcoms in the first place.  However, you are DEAD wrong in stating that Family Guy is taking queues from the Simpsons.  Firstly, the Simpsons' writers are all derived from a comedy writing team known as The Harvard Lampoon which includes Conan O'Brien as a member.  The writing on the Simpson is actually considered to be somewhat intellectual as it is based almost soley on 'SATIRE'.  The Family Guy however doesn't make those leaps.. and doesn't try to either.  Though I wouldn't call the Family Guy 'Low Brow' comedy, it does routinely strive for the quick laugh.  That said, Family Guy's usage of pop culture references is brilliant.  Is Family Guy becoming a bit over the top?  Probably.  I mean, the episode that shows Peter during a rolling session (taking ecstasy) blew me away.. and take it from someone who's taken E once or twice.. they were SPOT-On.  samhain959, lighten up.  "

Also, releasers only use the .rar-files (15mb or 50mb or some even 90/100mb) so that we can know that the sources are proper and haven't been altered.
