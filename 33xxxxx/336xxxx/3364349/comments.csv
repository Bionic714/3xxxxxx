,thriceavfc,2005-08-02T21:26Z,"Thanks for putting this up! :-)

-VinceOMac.. aren't you the guy from maxxed football forum? Just Curious :-)"
,gflare,2005-08-02T22:03Z,"eliteweb, why do you have to try to internalize everything?

this is just about an advertisement for the site, which just takes releases and passwords them so you have to visit their site.

Websites like this don't help the scene at all."
,VinceOMac,2005-08-02T23:41Z,Correctamundo.
,gflare,2005-08-03T01:12Z,"there is no point,  which is why eliteweb does nothing to help the community."
,Hatredandrage,2005-08-03T04:56Z,Do you need a mod chip to play this on the ps2? Sorry if that seems to be a stupid question
,greco_wass,2005-08-03T12:55Z,Does it work with Swap Magic?
,takeru,2005-08-03T15:37Z,no offically released on nforce... can anyone confirm this is working?
,gflare,2005-08-03T15:49Z,"Takeru:  it's on console-news, as well as a DVD-rip"
,angelpure,2005-08-03T17:10Z,Has anyone gotten this game to work?! I just bunt the image using alcohol 120% and for the first time ever I didn't get the game to work...
,CowboyBebop,2005-08-03T20:15Z,"How do you burn this correctly...? Ive tried to unzip all the files and burn it as a data cd, but that didnt work. It says its an iso file when its compressed, but when i unrar i get many folders and files. Not what im used to. Anybody know how?"
,klagenfurter,2005-08-03T22:56Z,Has anyone got this thing to work????? I haven't.... :(
,daush,2005-08-04T01:45Z,its so slow
,akita81,2005-08-04T02:04Z,A very good game!!
,kartritaren,2005-08-04T03:19Z,"Works perfectly if you just pack it up, starting with the .rar-file (of course) and then burning the ISO with either nero or dvd decrypter (I tried both)..."
,korio,2005-08-04T04:27Z,So is the menus in japanese and stuff? :O
,klagenfurter,2005-08-04T08:24Z,"I burned it with alcohol 120%, before I burned it, i patched it with englifh language patch. The reaseon that it ain't working can't be that? The patch itself should work fine... 

Fuck. I even tried to burn it to two differend dvds...but it ain't just working!!!"
,ersel83,2005-08-04T10:28Z,does we9 support online play??
,bilal2,2005-08-04T11:16Z,"@klagenfurter

,kartritaren,2005-08-04T11:30Z,I too am very much interested on how to get my hands on an english patch..

,bilal2,2005-08-04T15:30Z,Thanx very much for the help in finding the patch. 
,klagenfurter,2005-08-04T17:55Z,"The fucker ain't just working with my ps2...yes it has a mod-chip... FUCK! But what could be wrong?? I used verbatim's dvds, burned it with alcohol and even tried Nero, but no. All other games work just fine. Why this had to happen with this game!?!?! :) "
,MariusMal,2005-08-04T23:06Z,"i aplied the patch, burned this on a verbatin using an LG burner and everything ok, "
,MariusMal,2005-08-04T23:07Z,wich modchip do u have ??
,kartritaren,2005-08-05T13:15Z,"there's a 100% (well, practically) language patch out now btw.,. you'll need ppf-o-matic..

 and an option file (translates team and player names) as well, downloadable as a cd2memorycard-thing.. 

just look around on the pesinsight forums..
"
,kartritaren,2005-08-06T20:42Z,"For the people having problems finding or applying the patch(es), I've just put up a new torrent which is an already patched (""fernando's english patch v2"") version of this release...

,uFoSuPeRiOr,2005-08-06T23:15Z,Whats the password to stuff this file? 
,kartritaren,2005-08-07T15:10Z,There is no password...
,klagenfurter,2005-08-08T15:40Z,"

My modchip was PS2 gameloader or something like that...WE8LE is working properly. "
,mrsronaghi,2005-08-08T23:06Z,Tjena jag laddade ner denna torrent och patchade spelet men när jag patchade den så funkade inte spelet men när jag inte patchar den så funkar spelet. Och den torrenten som du kartritaren har lagt upp finns inte. Snälla nån som vet hur jag skall gå till väga. Jag laddade ner patchen som finns på pensinsight.com som heter Fernando_WE9_English_v2.zip och använde programet som heter ppf-o-matic och patcha med den men det funkar ej.Snälla hjälp.
,endremonsen,2005-08-09T19:47Z,I patched the game and that worked fine....
,Just_E,2005-08-10T11:34Z,Oki thanx
,Just_E,2005-08-10T11:52Z,I was wondeing if u patched this copy or do u have the oridinal game cd?? I heard that i cant patch the game witout the original cd????
,kartritaren,2005-08-10T18:35Z,"mrsronaghi: Jag tog bort min torrent. Det gick för slött, så ni får patcha den här själva istället. Det är hur lätt som helst.."
,mrsronaghi,2005-08-10T19:49Z,"Kan du berätta för mig hur man patchar snälla.
För jag har gjort som det står men det funkar inte för mig jag tänkte fråga hur du gjorde så kanske jag kan göra på samma sätt."
,Stefaa,2005-08-11T21:36Z,"Can someone please explain to me how this whole thing works?? I've never done anything like this before, I don't even know what a torrent is....If anyone knows a good site that could explain to me how this works, or if someone really nice would take the time to help me out, would be much appreciated"
,Stefaa,2005-08-12T22:14Z,"question...forget that crap that i previously wrote....i have now downloaded the file, and have the 29 .rar files....but they dont work!! I've tried to extract them and all that, but no, computer says they're damaged, or 'no archives found'....can anyone help me?
"
,kartritaren,2005-08-13T11:34Z,"open the file wjr-we9.RAR in winrar, not one of the numbered ones.."
,Stefaa,2005-08-14T09:10Z,"Alright...I downloaded it again, now it works....but i'm still new to this so i have a few questions.
I extracted the .rar files and one .iso file was created, but it's only 1,3 GB big (I was expecting it to be bigger) and it's still in .rar format (I think) because it can be extracted. So should i just burn the ISO on a DVD or should I extract it then burn?"
,marcelmilia,2005-08-14T15:27Z,can I play this game with a PC emulator?? tell me how plaease. thanks!!!
