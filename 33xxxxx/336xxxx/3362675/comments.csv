,Beaverlicker,2005-07-29T19:21Z,Thank you !!I dled some of of your previous releases and I think DTS sound is fantastic! better than DD!
,eggewert2,2005-07-29T21:52Z,Thank you! Been trying to buy this one but haven't found it! It's good already in two channels but the dts version is perhaps twice as good as that! Thanks! Can I burn this easily to be played in an ordinary dts dvd player? Or do I need some special program for that?
,torarnes,2005-07-30T02:08Z,"You can burn it with Nero, choose ""Burn image"""
,eggewert2,2005-08-01T14:31Z,"Worked wonderfully! A millon thanks! Wonderful sound and one of the better pop music surround mixes ever made (haven't heard Parsons A Valid Path in surround, but On Air is a better album anyway, so...)"
