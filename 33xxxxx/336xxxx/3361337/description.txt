  A young man, on a heroic journey, in the greatest adventure of all
  time... Azurik - Rise of Perathia, a third person, 3D action
  adventure game designed to showcase the capabilities of the Xbox, you
  assume the role of a young apprentice Lore Guardian named Azurik.
  Sworn to protect the sacred elements - fire, water, earth, and air.
  You must stop an apocalyptic prophecy that threatens to condemn your
  world to destruction. With intense hand-to-hand combat, intuitive
  puzzles, amazing seamless environments, and vast exploration, Azurik
  combines the best of three genres by including ample doses of epic
  adventure, fast console-style action, and intriguing story-based RPG
  gameplay. Harness the power of the elements, only on the Xbox.

  * Action, "Axion" style - A revolutionary weapon system lets gamers
    unleash the fury of the elements with attack powers and shield in a
    fraction of a second. Every great warrior must master his weapon;
    Azurik must also balance brains and brawn to defeat his enemies. 

  * A Huge, Seamless Universe - The world of Perathia is an immense
    environment with regions dedicated to the elemental realms of air,
    earth, water, fire, death, and life. Each region is a feast for the
    eyes with incredible rich textures, dynamic lighting , real shading
    and spectacular particle effects that will make the world seem
    truly alive.

  * Smart, Dynamic Enemies - A vast array of unique and ever-changing
    creatures work together; flocking, swarming and riding one another
    to present dynamic combat challenges. Each creature has its
    weakness - find it, and exploit it to win. Be careful come
    nightfall, some things are not as they seem. 

  * True Freedom in Gameplay - The gamer is truly free to explore the
    world of Perathia. Move between realms with no loading screens to
    distract you from your adventure. 


  We tested this game on a developer XBOX, and it works.  Since there is
  no mod chip yet, we have no idea if this release will work on retail
  XBOXes when/if a mod comes out.  However, now that there is a release,
  a modchip developer will be inclined to get our releases to work, so
  we think a future mod will work with this release.

  If a game is small enough to be burned to a CD, you can burn it to 
  either a CD or DVD, at your option, using the same ISO file.  
  The Xbox does not use media checks like the PS2. 

  When burning to a CD, if your CD burning program has an option, 
  choose "MODE1/2048", exactly as if you were burning a PC CD-ROM.
  We recommend PrimoDVD for burning Xbox for both CD and DVD, but 
  all CD writing software besides Clone CD should work fine.

  From our experience, the retail Xbox can only read DVD-RW's
  and CD-RW's, so if you want to be sure that these will work
  with a future mod, we recommend burning them to Rewritable
  discs. We have heard reports of the retail Xbox reading some
  types of DVD-R discs, but we have been unable to verify this.
