,TheTart,2005-07-31T22:36Z,"The person below me sounds a happy bunny...

Try to set your Xbox options
Video output: Auto
Lock your XBOX hard drive.
You might need to upgrade to the latest version of slayer to get these options

http://slayer.xbox-scene.com

It kept going back to the dashboard before I did this.  It might not work for you but it worked on mine"
,gorap,2005-08-02T11:34Z,"download this
Grand.Theft.Auto.San.Andreas.DAGGER.PAL.XBOX.Fix-PT 
and use it and u should b able to play the game from hdd... worked for me...

,malmern,2005-08-07T22:37Z,"Lol! everybody says they have problems with GTA:SA NTSC Version! My modded PAL xbox plays both NTSC and PAL versions of all games! (I.E NTSC DJFFNY, PAL SW:EP3, PAL TWPGAT '05) and many other games!"
,malmern,2005-08-07T22:40Z,"(P.S: all you people having problems playing NTSC or PAL games, turn region to default, dunno if this helps, but it's worth a try I guess. If it doesn't you can turn it back to it's previous setting without damage!)"
,shady78,2005-08-08T18:00Z,yup i play both and i dont understand i downloaded this and it worked the first time off disc and hdd i just dont understand why everybody is having problems i come to the conclusion its either the modchip/bios or the settings people use on there xbox i havent found one game that does not work yet
,san_dep,2005-08-10T04:47Z,I dont know whats wrong... i extracted the iso and put it on my xbox but when i try to play the game the screen goes blank for a sencond and then goes back to the main menu. Can anyone help?
,joa_38,2005-08-17T12:46Z,"when i start san andreas from the hdd, the game starts but there are no colors what should i do??"

,Klokka2,2006-03-20T09:15Z,"Do this and it should work fine:
Make sure your clock/date is 2006 . (check it)
Change these settings to:
TSR Disabel 
In Game Reset Off (U can still use the reset)
Save and exit

If this does not work. Put Game region to default/auto (i use default)

Now my game work."

,PirateBob2828,2008-04-05T07:29Z,"Worked for me. Playing off the disc was iffy, and it constantly froze. I copied it to my Hdd and it wouldn't work under evolutionX. I opened up the surface system (leave the tray of the xbox open while starting the system)- File Manager (main menu)- game drive (generally E:/games or somthing) and then the .xbi file of SanAndreas and it loaded right up no problem. Saving works, along with everything else. "
