Thanks very much."
,georgeTfer,2007-02-14T14:28Z,"It always seems to show 1 seeder for this torrent on this site, but my client doesn't pick it up (there is none in the seeder swarm on the client either).  Anyway, really looking forward to have this finished -stuck at 89.3%.  There seems to be 7 others waiting for a seeder to appear.  Hail the seeder -armis you around ;)  sent you a 'pm', too.

We await arrival...
-cheers"
