,kr0,2006-05-03T03:32Z,This torrent has been seedless for some time. It is safe to assume he/she has done a runner. The poor bugger must have an attention span of a 5 yr old. Save your bandwidth and don't bother to download this torrent. Everyone is stuck at 10.5% and I very much doubt it will climb higher.
