,Erunno,2008-10-29T16:34Z,"Well, like everybody else I'm stuck at 97.4 percent as there's no complete copy across all 8 peers I'm connected to. If anybody still has this torrent and the complete data me (and I'm sure the others as well) would be grateful if this person could seed it for a day or two as it would be enough to get at least another complete copy."
