MySecretFolder? is a software utility that you can use to hide your private folder from other users, hide it so that no one will even suspect that your secret folder exists! Yet the folder would be easily accessible to you, when you need it: just press the "hot key", enter your password, and it will open in a window, just like a regular Windows folder. While the folder is unprotected, you can work with the files and documents it contains, just like with any other folder you have. When you are done, enter your password, and the folder will disappear again, until you need it next time.
