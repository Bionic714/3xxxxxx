The game tells story about little samurai Musashi and his legendary sword Lumina.
It's great action-RPG game from Squaresoft. Game have few nice systems like day and night and draining abilities from monsters. Also many side-quests and mini-games. Including nice graphic and good story line it is must have to those who like RPG and to those who collect Squaresoft games.
