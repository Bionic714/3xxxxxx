        .6 Proof of the Pudding  (edit)
        Guest star: Doris Petrie (Agnes Leslie), Paul Haddad (Mr. Simpkins) 

        Bossy cousin Felicity is left in charge of all the children when Aunt 
        Janet and Uncle Alec go away to celebrate their 15th wedding anniversary, 
        and then Aunt Hetty decides she must go to Charlottetown to protect the 
        farms "water rights". 

        Felicity soon antagonizes the other children into misbehaving. Felix 
        eats "poison berries", Sara smears Felicity's cherry pie all over 
        Felicity's dress and even cuts off some of her "perfect" hair. 

        A visit by the Governor's wife makes for confusion as to her identity. 

        By the story's end, the children have all "learned lessons" and Sara 
        become friends with the formerly unfriendly Felix and Felicity. 

        My favourite quote: "Felicity King is known throughout Avonlea for her 
        cherry pies and sawdust pudding" ~ Felix King
