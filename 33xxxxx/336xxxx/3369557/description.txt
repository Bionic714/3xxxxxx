Pappo (born Norberto Napolitano), after wandering in and outside the country with different variations of Pappo?s Blues, decided to form Aeroblus with bass player Alejandro Medina (ex-Manal and La Pesada) and Brazilian drummer "Junior" Castello. As usual, they played rock and blues, ...but this time a little harder!

They cut one album influenced by bands like Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath, with great instrumental work by all three members. Best moments are the opening "Vamos a buscar la luz", "Nada estoy sabiendo" and the excellent blues "Vendr√≠amos a buscar".

The group did not survive their first album. Castello returned to his country, while Pappo and Medina formed yet another version of Pappo?s Blues. Shortly afterwards, Pappo would enjoy success with Riff, a heavy metal band.

Aeroblus LP is difficult to find but thankfully it has been released on CD.
