,Track-R,2007-12-26T14:29Z,"Awesome pack! Finally a torrent of old games that's not from the 286 age! I've seen many pack consisting of junk games that I hated in their age too. Smirnof chose right, good sense for good games!
I've setup a pentium1 machine for these - you can try emulation, but it's better to run these in their native environment. 
OK guys, don't forget to seed ;)"
,Lucky13s,2008-04-11T02:15Z,Track-R is probably right. You guys cant get these to run because your computers are too good for 'em! Fire up your old P1 PC's if you wanna play these!
