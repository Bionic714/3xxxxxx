3(8). Weight Of The World
--------------------------------
Someone puts his 4400 ability up for auction, and the Supreme Court will have a 
special session to determine if it's legal and if the auction can continue. Diana 
and Tom are ordered to investigate. Meanwhile, pop diva Chloe Granger is at the 
4400 Center and claims that Jordan's book was a revelation to her. She even cut 
her tour short because she felt she needed to come to the 4400 Center and become 
a student. Jordan makes sure this new "recruit" is well treated as it will profit 
the center. Shawn is working on a recruitment video for the 4400 Center. Richard 
and Lily travel to Montana where they meet with Eric Papequash, who disappeared 
in 1955.

4(9). Suffer The Children
A school teacher terrifies parents with her supernatural ability to inspire 
artistic students. Meanwhile, Richard and Lily are confronted by police, and
