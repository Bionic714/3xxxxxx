To download media files streamed through mms/rtsp, you need to know the URL (server address, file name) of a stream you want to download. 

Unfortunately, some links to streaming audio and video that you come across on the web are hidden behind JavaScript, Flash or ActiveX. So it is sometimes very difficult to figure out the actual URLs that correspond to the streams being played.
