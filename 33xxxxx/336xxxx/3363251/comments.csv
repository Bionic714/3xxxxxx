,dudu1964,2006-09-14T23:54Z,"Thanks - great selection, great presentation."
,beestripe,2006-11-03T07:32Z,"wow great selection of music here, I'm all for free distribution of music and software but as a person who has had long respect for John Zorns excellent label Tzadik, I encourage anyone of you who appreciates the music here to support the artists and label by coughing up the moola and acquire yourself a fresh CD copy . It's truly a label without compromise that focuses on musical merit rather than commercial gain. Check out places like forcedexposure.com to find a well priced catalogue. Happy Listening..."
