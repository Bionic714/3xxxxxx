John Zorn :  Redbird
 Cat. # 7008
Released 1995
cd time - 49:52
US Price $15.00
1. Dark River 
2. Redbird   
  
 
  
A kinder and gentler Zorn, exploring a sound world not unlike those pioneered by composers Giacinto Scelsi, Morton Feldman and Olivier Messiaen. Acoustic, minimal/ambient music of unusual subtlety and beauty, inspired by, and dedicated to the work of artist Agnes Martin. "Redbird," a hypnotic work for harp, violin, cello and percussion mirrors the detailed and complex painting for which it is named, as a series of chords are ordered and reordered, creating a play of memory and surprise that will leave the listener in a sensual reverie. It's difficult to believe that "Dark River" for four bass drums is actually acoustic music; the interplay of sonorities reminds one more of tape manipulation or the electronic beating of underwater sonar.

Composed in the summer of 1978 at a time when I was spending almost every day at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in search of inspiration, this music was originally written for and is dedicated to guitarist Eugene Chadbourne. Meant to GAS him, and to stretch his already prodigious virtuosity to even wilder extremes, many of the extended techniques used here (toy balloons, talking dolls, mbira keys, wet finger whoops) were learned from him and were an integral part of his improvisational language at that time. Others are standard to contemporary classical guitar notation (body knocks, whisks, bowing, multiple harmonics) and still others were the product of my own sick imagination (playing with pencils, rice, pulling strings out of the bridge notch). 

Marc Ribot tackles all of these effects with unusual precision and an astouding virtuosity, adding his own personal touches to make the music even more beautiful than I could have imagined. 

Guitarist Marc Ribot has released his own music on Island, Avant and Les Disques du Crepescule. He has performed worldwide with Tom Waits, Elvis Costello, the Lounge Lizards, Chuck Berry, as well as his own solo projects and bands.

Composer, theorist, inventor of musical instruments, and one of the most colorful characters of 20th century music, Harry Partch (1901-1974) broke with Western tradition and forged a new music based on a more primal, corporeal integration of the elements of speech, rhythm and performance using the intrinsic music found in the spoken word, the principles of acoustic resonance and just-intonation. 

The Seventeen Lyrics of Li Po was composed between 1931 and 1933 and is among Partch's earliest extant compositions. They were composed for Intoning Voice and Partch's Adapted Viola, a hybrid instrument consisting of a cello neck grafted onto the body of a viola, its open strings sounding one octave below the violin. Partch used texts from the eighth century Chinese poet, Li Po. 

This is the first recording of all seventeen of Partch's Lyrics of Li Po. 

Baritone Stephen Kalm has sung with many of America's leading regional opera companies and symphony orchestras, and received critical acclaim as the Subjective Voice in Harry Partch's US. Highball with Newband in Berlin, and for creating the role of Franco Hartmann in Meredith Monk's Atlas, which he has also recorded for ECM. He can also be heard on New World Records' Ponder Nothing, singing Five Fragments by Ben Johnston. 

Cellist Ted Mook has recorded over 2 dozen works, including Lois V. Vierk's Simoon for eight multi-tracked cellos, Ezra Sim's Solo in Four Movements (with its 72-note per octave source scale) and discs of standard repertoire with the New York-based Philharmonia Virtuosi. He has recorded for ECM, Arabesque, Opus One, CRI, Columbia Masterworks, Mode, Ess.A.Y., Avant, Cambridge, New World, Experimental Intermedia, Ear Rational, and Northeastern Records.

Stephen Kalm: Intoning Voice
