,hanludret,2005-08-17T21:34Z,Does it include european maps?
,dinch,2006-01-20T13:57Z,Thanks for the seeds.  My question is this - How does the program open with no .exe file?  Thanks
,TorrentFox,2006-04-23T06:56Z,"The files included are disk images. You would use a program like Daemon Tools (http://daemon-tools.cc) to ""mount"" them as if they were CD-roms in a virtual drive."
,no_nick,2006-07-07T14:59Z,"Im not sure what maps it include, but you can download several from microsoft:

[V],cezen,2009-02-19T17:10Z,"proper place to report possible virus and trojan is at http://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34.

this has been reported and is being checked out.. if this torrent is still here, then it is not infected and maybe your problems were due to some spyware or another application"
