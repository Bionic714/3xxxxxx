Metalheart: Replicants Rampage is a cyberpunk role-playing game. Lead your team to success using smart tactics; explore a huge isometric world, experience unique cybernetic body implants and tactical, turn-based combat. The player controls a team of up to 6 members (choose from replicants, cyborgs, mutants and nomads.) Allying with different groups changes the flow of the game: being hostile to nomads opens the way to getting friendly cyborgs or mutants to provide new quests. A lot also depends on the composition of the team: a pure cyborg team requires a different strategy than mutants or nomads.
