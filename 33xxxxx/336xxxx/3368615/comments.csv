,Sun3,2005-08-11T21:58Z,Fsck Bush? Surely you mean Fuck Bush?
,rci,2005-08-11T23:00Z,sure fuck the nazi puppet ..
,GYMMY,2005-08-12T04:04Z,"Fuck Bush? You stupid fucktard! maybe you should go to the link you posted under info, dumbass."
,Color_42,2005-08-12T11:33Z,LoL everyone with a little bit of common sence knows Bush is a pupet nothing more nothing less he's just the front man the real people pulling the strings is his dad's old friends but that is an other story :D
,rci,2005-08-12T12:13Z,"gimmy... you sound like an ignorant asshole, excuse me ;)"
,cosmic,2005-08-12T20:40Z,"Yeah! FUCk that SOB with a machine gun, hard and loud. How the hell could such an IDIOT become a president? Don't be afraid; and furthermore, choose another president next time! "
,GYMMY,2005-08-13T00:32Z,"Yea, it figures that a bunch of liberal fucktards would be the main users of a leeching service, because they want everything for free. Get over it already dipshits, Algore lost and Kerry lost. Try and get an agenda......pathetic...."
,BaDHaBiTt,2005-08-13T01:05Z,LOL! GYMMY is most definitely a retard! :D Oh.. He's a republican? figures..... 
,kousite,2005-08-14T00:31Z,"you guys are idiots.  Bush didn't start this, don't forget the US was attacked first."
,kousite,2005-08-14T03:40Z,"xlife sorry but ""je ne parle pas francaise"" dipshit"
,GYMMY,2005-08-14T05:32Z,"No, I'm not a ""Republican"", you dip-shit. I don't need to affiliate myself with a party, and I'm not some brain-washed yuppee who is a liberal dickwad just because his college professor told him so. I have voted for both republicans and democrats, but the way the democrat party is going nowdays, who in their right mind would vote for them? They have no agenda at all, except to piss and moan about President Bush. I would think they would realize that he isn't going anywhere, and maybe they should start thinking about the next election. So all you whining little bitches quit yer moaning and show us that you have a better idea, instead of how to be a sore loser."
,kousite,2005-08-14T13:25Z,liberals **sigh** .... isn't it about time you put your bras back on?
,effie2085,2005-08-14T20:39Z,Well it's democracy you know ;-)  
,kousite,2005-08-15T01:24Z,saddam tried to assassinate bush sr. years ago.   If clinton wasn't so busy sampling communist cigars he would have done something about it during his term.
,warpengi,2005-08-15T01:40Z,"If Saddam trying to assassinate (which I doubt) is a invade and destroy the country then I guess someone should have done that to the u.s. years ago as they have been party to many assassinations and failed assassination attempts.  Of course nobody can because the u.s. has more weaponry and firepower than anyone else in the world.  Despite that they don't have the guts to say plainly that we don't give a fsck about the rest of the world we just want to rule it for profit.  That is how people like kousite and gymmy get drawn into these ridiculous justifications because they actually believe the idiocy that is trotted out in thier media about how they have some supoerior ethical or moral reasons for killing.  Oh well, the u.s. will soon be a 3rd world country and unable to transport their weapons overseas.  Then they can stick to using their depleted uranium to poison themselves."
,kousite,2005-08-15T03:37Z,warpengi do you think hailing from gay paree adds gravitas to your musing?
,warpengi,2005-08-15T04:10Z,"Uh, no kousite.  That would be silly because I don't hail from gay Parie.
Do you think your smart?  Well I hate be the one to tell you this but you're a moron."
,kousite,2005-08-15T05:23Z,well at least you felt bad about saying it.  Thats something i suppose
,warpengi,2005-08-15T06:01Z,That made me laugh out loud.  Good one!
,BaDHaBiTt,2005-08-15T23:51Z,"GYMMY, you're not a republican? I guess rep.party ain't right winged enough for you?"
,kousite,2005-08-17T06:01Z,sorry angel that post you left was too long.  I'm not going to read 43 pages without punctuation.  Can you summarize please?
