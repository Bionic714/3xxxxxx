,Jimage,2008-01-21T06:48Z,"I'm seeding the 99.9% I was able to get a while ago, but will show up as a leecher, for anyone who's contemplating this torrent. Anyone got some more NamNamBulu to seed?"

,Frau_Dragana,2008-11-15T16:44Z,"Sitting on 99.8%, Please reseed =]"
,phoenix321,2011-08-17T13:36Z,"a) Torrent is showing up as incomplete, but only lacks 1 frame of 1 track and is probably ""good enough"" for most.

b) Bitrate is ~200kbit VBR, but encoder quality is pretty low - definitely not a LAME -q 0 build. High frequency ringing artifacts (listen to track 09 ""memories"" and especially #11 ""now or never"" if in doubt) - turn down the treble or you'll go deaf when using headphones. "
