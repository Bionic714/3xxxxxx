The guys who did this are not part of a huge conglomerate like EA or MS, they are a few people who invested their personal savings to try and get an indy studio up and running. Currently they are soliciting ideas from the community (which I'm a part of, I dont work for them) and so far they are going to release mod tools, expanded gameplay types and much more simply because we asked for it. How often do you hear shitbags like EA (who have more money than God) do something like that? They rather keep pumping out sequel after sequel of some mediocre piece of crap or latch on to some movie IP (we all know how well those turn out).

Thanks for  listening guys, again, please help them out and buy it if you enjoyed it."

Myself, I won't buy it for the  very same reason."
