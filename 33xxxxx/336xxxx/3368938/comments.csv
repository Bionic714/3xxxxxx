No one forces you to download, so go to store and buy it if you dont like it, as simple as that.

Why not dutt and why not datt and bla bla, I can ask you the same thing, why havent you uploaded a single torrent? Atleast he try so stfu! You think movies grows on the tree? if you pay him for a better Upload I sure think he will upload that to!"
