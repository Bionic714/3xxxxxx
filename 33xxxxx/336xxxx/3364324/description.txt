iRadio is a new way of capturing and collecting music from radio stations over the Internet. This is a standalone program: it means that it does not use any preinstalled SDK or media platforms like Windows Media for recording and playing media streams. Integrated easy search engine allows you to find favourite radio by genre or keyword, to choose bitrate and other characteristics.
