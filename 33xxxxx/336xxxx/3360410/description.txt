Another installment in the great "Love, Peace & Poetry series of rare late sixties/early seventis psychedelia from around the globe. Imho tHis is perhaps the best in the series - and that says A LOT. THe combination of asian musical tradition and eastern rhytms mixed with western popculture - throw in a few psychedelic dru..err..influences and the result is some truly great music. 

(Try searching the bay for "love peace" etc if you want the other albums in the series, I`m still seeding them)
