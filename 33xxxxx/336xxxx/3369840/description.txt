"Singer/guitarist Steve Morgen and company originally hailed from Long Island, New York. Signed by ABC's short-lived Probe subsidiary, their 1969 debut Morgen teamed them with producer Murray Shiffrin. After this superb debut the entire band quite simply disappeared. If you're into heavy psych guitar, then this is for you. While Morgen had a competent, if limited voice, he was a truly amazing guitarist with the likes of Nick Saloman of Bevis Frond becoming a staunch advocate of Morgen's status as a 'psychedelic guitar hero'. Tracks such as 'Eternity In Between', 'Welcome To the Void', 'Of Dreams' and 'Beggin Your Pardon' (Miss Joan) were simply drenched with fuzz and feedback guitar. Underpinned by Maiman's powerhouse drumming (easily compared with Led Zepplin's John Bonham) and suitably trippy lyrics and you're looking at a pseudo-classic slice of psychedelia."
