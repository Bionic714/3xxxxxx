,Dirty50ck5,2005-08-16T23:27Z,Can someone please seed this?!?!
,fuzzyka,2005-08-17T11:50Z,"Sorry, went away for the weekend and someone turned off my pc.  Have resumed seeding.  Anyone got any suggestions as to how I can upload it to a website somewhere, it's only a 600kb rar file for the subs and would download instantly instead of queuing in my torrent client."
,cardinalae,2006-03-16T20:23Z,"everytime, there is flicking as in something is wrong with the DVD. Comments?"
,hasi-basi,2006-04-20T20:49Z,"SEED!!!
Is it proper subs btw? 'cos I've got some which really appear randomly and seem to made by an non-russian speaker!"
