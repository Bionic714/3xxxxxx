,collin_stevens,2007-12-12T16:28Z,"Can this be used for Classic? I'm not real clear as the comments by the up loader say it ""ist"" for Classic. Not sure if that means isn't or is. Anyway I installed this and the install os9 from another torrent and I can't seem to use Classic still. Any ideas?"
,pushf12,2008-02-16T04:14Z,"This is intended for the Classic environment of Mac OS X.  The dmg is complete, but it doesn't have many components that are useful in a standalone system.

Use the Mac OS 9 retail media if you want to run this operating system on the iron outside of Mac OS X.

Awesome torrent, uploader."
