              - FADED GALLERIA -

The latest album from up and coming composer-
bassist-producer Jareth Kanemere, FADED GALLERIA
promises to be a sonic treat for all. Under
development for several years and created using
ACID, the album has come full circle. From its
inception as Space Cowboy Blues to the many
intermediate iterations, FADED GALLERIA is
presented in high quality 320kbs mp3 format!

It has been a long journey, but I make my debut
among the BitTorrent community. While I wish
everyone enjoyed the music equally, I
understand that not everyone will understand or
like it. My source of inspiration? Besides the
myriad of artists who have come before me, I
just simply create things that I like to listen
to. Disc 1 is the A-Side, the part that I first
worked under as SPACE COWBOY BLUES. Disc 2 is
the B-Sides. Stuff that came after finishing
SCB, stuff from incomplete projects, as well
as an important breakthrough. Namely, "The
Death of Chewbacca" which was the development
name for my AP Music Theory Final. I once
hoped to have a live recording, but things
have developed in a way that I couldn't find
the time for it to be pperformed, or at least
performed well. The song on thisalbum is the
final MIDI render, presented in high quality
the same as the rest of the songs. I ask my
listeners only to understand the circumstance
and fill in the holes.

On another note, there are several guest
artists that I have taken the liberty to
remix (some more than others). Some have made
it into ACIDplanet contests, others have not.
In the end, this is all about sonic
emmersion. I hope everyone enjoys it as much
as I enjoyed creating it! I look forward to
feedback!!!
