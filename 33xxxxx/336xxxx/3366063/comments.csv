,dellamorte,2005-08-06T11:56Z,"can't upload it because i have it on vinyl but if you ever have the chance to pick up pebbles vol. 5: the roots of mod, get it. its the best volume of pebbles i've heard. "
,Powaqqatsi2004,2005-08-06T13:19Z,Ive got Nuggets on my HD if thats of any interest?
,test78,2005-08-06T13:47Z,"Heck yeah its of interest !! I have 1,2 & 3 but none of the others so upload`em if you got`em ! :D"
,Powaqqatsi2004,2005-08-06T14:03Z,"Only the first one I'm afraid (58 trax, starts with Electric Prunes - I Had Too Much to Dream). Any use? "
,test78,2005-08-06T15:28Z,"OOps I misread that. Nuggets are already uploaded onto the bay, and there is little point in a dupe. Sorry, my bad :S If you have any of the Boulders Vols Id be totally interested tho :D I`ll be uploading some of the ""sixties archives"" series, Endless Journey Vols and a few other fuzzed out compilations in the near future, so stay tuned for more ^_^"

,jingleking,2006-05-24T14:37Z,"Any of you guys got the Endless Journey comps that test78 upped? If so, it would be excellent if you would reseed... Please..."
