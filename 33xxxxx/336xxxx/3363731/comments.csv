,Diahazart,2006-04-04T10:43Z,serious how open that?
,Woebin,2006-10-09T02:05Z,"Try WinRAR, genius."
,cainc5,2006-10-19T03:28Z,"or download CDisplay, a good little program that reads those .rar/.zip archives."
,bcaseb,2007-01-01T01:41Z,SEED please only 15% left! been waiting forever!
,SADonkeylips,2007-01-25T02:52Z,Can someone please seed?
,quintcidence,2008-01-26T13:48Z,WinRAR doesn't open CBR files... you have to download a comic reader
,Falleen_Fan_No_1,2008-02-23T21:04Z,"Download CDisplay.  Best thing for reading digital comics (CBR or CBZ).  If you really want to view these as jpegs though, just change the file extension to RAR or ZIP, and then use WinRar to unpack."
,DaBus4043,2008-03-23T15:57Z,WinRAR does open .cbr files
,sumdumnam,2008-08-28T09:26Z,"problems:
missing pages -- issues #04 (p20) & #15 (p17)

duplicates--
""Transmetropolitan #01 - #03.cbr"" is same content as ""Transmetropolitan - Back on the Streets.cbz"" (in ""Specials"" folder);
""Transmetropolitan - Edgy Winter.cbr"" is same content as ""Transmetropolitan Christmas Special #01.cbz"" (both in ""Specials"" folder)

other than that, good upload, thx"
,Sogemplow,2008-10-15T10:27Z,"To view .cbz and .cbr files, either rename them(cbz becomes zip and cbr becomes rar) or download 7zip.
7zip can open hidden archives.

Alternatively use one of those comic viewing programs.

Also, great torrent, thanks."
,Byurn,2009-12-07T21:35Z,Nice! Now I don't have to wait for my library to get these back.
,shulato,2011-03-24T07:52Z,try using http://www.opencbr.com to open/extract your cbr files.

,Dhatz,2011-04-19T13:36Z,are you getting weird image artifacts too?
,coBainMenz,2011-09-01T23:24Z,"You could un pack it using WinRar, and then maybe launch it using ms office picture manager."
,j0nnyboy,2012-04-28T09:36Z,"i'm sorry but some of you guys are dumber than dogshit. you guys could google ""how to view cbr / cbz files"".

and find out ""oh i could download this very small program called cDisplay or one similar to that"""
