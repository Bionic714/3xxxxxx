  The original king of crazy driving is hitting Glitter Oasis. Crazy
  Taxi 3: High Roller brings breakneck speed and wild automotive action
  to America's Playground! Get behind the wheel with one of four new
  characters, each with their own trademark attitude and a new set of
  wheels. Throw out the rules of the road to make it big, with wackier
  customers, devious shortcuts and even crazier driving moves. Cruise
  around popular locations in and around the city on a quest to amass
  the highest amount of tips. Whether it's making crazy money in
  Glitter Oasis, conquering the new batch of mini-game challenges or
  trying out new tricks in the old stomping grounds of the West Coast
  and the Small Apple, Crazy Taxi 3 guarantees the best odds to beat
  the house.
  * The action takes place in Glitter Oasis at night - as well as in a
    revised version of the Crazy Taxi West Coast course and the Small
    Apple course from Crazy Taxi 2 set at night.
  * All-new addictive mini-games including Crazy Ring of Fire and Crazy
    Tornado.
  * Four wild new cabbies and vehicles.
  * Tons of group customers - each with signature animations and
    hilarious interactions with the drivers.
  * Over-the-top hotel destinations like Valhalla, Galaxy and Pax
    Romana, which dwarf reality in their grandeur.
