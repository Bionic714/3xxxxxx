,Morphen,2005-08-07T11:01Z,"No RATS here, please!"
,das_cronic,2005-08-07T16:39Z,"What's the point of uploading a DVD if you are going to ruin the quality by compressing it? Please, next time just up it in it's original format."
,hobozo,2005-08-12T01:42Z,what so wrong with ratdvd. still way better than divx and xvid coz the menus are included. and oh so easy to convert to a dvd. do all u complaining wankers have hightech hdtv or what. the quality is soo close anyway so stop whining and look at the bright side of life
,Der Steppenwolf,2006-01-04T02:21Z,"hobozo you litle cocksucker the point here is that 
A: eltiburonmarcelo writes info in spanish (but hey he's a cocksucker too so)
B: He post ratDVD movie in DVD-R section. 
And to the poster dont use ratDVD, you are the RAT "
,Darkave10,2007-10-02T23:16Z,but there isnt a RatDVD section to post there......and there is nothing wrong with RatDVD u download a file that is 5 times smaller than the original + the quality is almost the same
