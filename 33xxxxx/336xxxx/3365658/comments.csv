,mythmore,2011-05-18T15:11Z,"Heeey please jag vill ha detta spel sĂĽ illa...
SEEDA mother fucker SEEDAAAA"
,kolokythis,2011-08-26T12:57Z,"To install the game use a program like daemon tools and mount one disk after the other. No crack is needed. The game has some weird problems indeed. By default its getting installed in C drive even if it is not the local drive, but you can change the path without problem. Don't forget to install the Divx codec and player (included in the package) otherwise the game will not run. Also, you must have the disk1 mounted while playing. Many thanks to the uploader for the difficult to find game!"
