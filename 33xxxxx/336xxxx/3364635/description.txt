In year 2000 I made an animation called Proxima which had some nice flying in desert and shooting missiles. 5 years later, in 2005, Columbia Pictures releases a $130M movie called Stealth which has almost exactly the same opening scene that my animation. I made a composite video of Proxima and Stealth side by side and you can see the similarities. (PS. Stealth sucks, don't watch it even if you see it free)
