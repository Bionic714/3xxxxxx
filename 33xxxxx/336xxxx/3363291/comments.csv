,Cornflower,2005-07-31T00:42Z,"Oh, and you'll get ""invalid passkey"" on some of these Roswellian torrents. That's because I had some of them uploaded on POTUK, but their tracker was so unstable so I stopped uploading there. Unfortunately, I forgot to clear out the tracker from the torrents, so basically the torrent still believes that it's uploaded to POTUK also, which it isn't. Hence the ""invalid passkey"" message. Just ignore it, please."
