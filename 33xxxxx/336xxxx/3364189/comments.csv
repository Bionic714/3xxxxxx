,shinobiXRT,2011-08-11T11:50Z,"""baked into it"" :D

sorry to say, after 30mins I couldnt watch anymore of this dreary film. I love character dramas that are story driven. But this one was lack lustre and the characters were so thin it was almost disney.

,Damyan29Damyan29,2011-10-12T00:43Z,"Lars von Trier HAD TO START from something. This movie is one of those ""early experiments"" i would call it. It will never becomse a ""CLASSIC"" as there is more symbolism than form in it. Cinematography here is stressfull, camera is jerky. A movie hard to enjoy - but quite a portion of food for brain. Only for LVTrier fans."
,bc1990,2011-11-06T17:28Z,this was not directed by lars von trier
,Torgard,2011-11-24T05:32Z,"This film has nothing to do with Von Trier.
