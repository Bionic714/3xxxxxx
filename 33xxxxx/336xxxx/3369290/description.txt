Flight One Software, in partnership with Peter Wilding, brings you another add-on to further enhance your virtual flight experiences in Flight Simulator 2004. FS Water was developed to provide users with a new set of soothing water/sky textures that will help brighten up any virtual flight.


The new texture sets has been optimized for use with Flight Simulator 2004 and have little impact on performance, while provide new realistic color and tones to both inland and ocean water areas within the sim.

FS Water includes more dynamic wave action effects with added wave height, a more pleasing turquoise water texture for those who like to island hop in the tropics. Kelp-like water surfaces of varying degrees in regions such as Seattle, Europe, and other parts of the world. The package also includes improved reflections that are even better then the award winning environment textures by Peter Wilding. The package also contains a new set of sunrise and sunset textures to improve realistic sky color at those times of day.

Happy Flying
