,artyD,2007-02-04T14:11Z,Are there swedish text somewhere out there for this one?
,macadamia,2007-03-02T01:21Z,"Just signed up after I found this here...

First up, thx much to sickboy88.  Your review is wonderful, my friend.  You are absolutely right, this movie is just great.  VERY underrated, and hardly anyone even knows about it.  Compare this to one of Renee Zellwegger's other early films - Texas Chainsaw Massacre - and see the difference!

Cheers!  I'll seed this as I do everything once complete - up to 150%.

Thanks!"

I had it on VHS for a long time, now I hope I can get this as a replacement :D"
,screamerz,2007-04-29T16:03Z,thanks!! been looking for this some time now. also had this on vhs. but lost tape somehow. thanks for this one sickboy!
,justinuff79,2008-01-28T00:03Z,"You are da man sickboy! I seen this movie on showtime like 7 years ago and I have been trying to find it ever since. They had one copy of it at my local video store and some greedy assclown decided to never take it back.                     

Awesome movie!!! Now I can show it to people instead of trying to describe it. Thanks for the upload bro!"
,meatfoam,2009-02-24T16:29Z,"This film is a Classic.
 What happend to C.M. Talkington?"
,stuckey27,2009-03-23T14:02Z,"I'm so glad I found this, thanks for the up. Rory Cochrane is fuckin' insane in this flik."
,morskmees,2009-04-23T12:37Z,Nice one sickboy88! this film is fantastic. i always tell hardcore tarantino fans to watch this to see where he stole most of his ideas for early films. so thankyou!

Truly a classic. If you like it check out Linklater's ""Slacker"".  Both exude Austin TX culture from that era.

p.s. No actress was ever sexier than young Zellwegger as Starlene Cheatham."
,PelotasUA,2011-04-24T07:14Z,Awesome movie. I had no expectations going into it and I came out with a new favorite.  Highly recommended! 
,caper454,2012-06-21T05:06Z,I saw this movie on PPV back in 1995 and fell in love with it. Extremely under-rated.
