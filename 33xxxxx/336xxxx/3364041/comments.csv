,pbransford,2006-07-08T04:34Z,"I dont remember completely, but i don't think this game had any copy protection (besides checking for  the data on the disk, if anything).

You should be fine on a DVD.

,Eggbert54,2007-08-10T11:47Z,"and i dont think it requires daemon tools,still nice to have though ;). Just extract the cd1 and cd2 .rar folders and run the setup in the cd1 folder, but run it in windows 98/ME compatibility, it will install the contents of disk 1 then it will ask you for disk 2. A window should pop up,change the directory in the window to the cd2 folder you extracted. then change the directory back at the end of installation. if you run the game it will ask you for cd2, this is what the crack is for. extract thiefcrk.exe to the game directory and run it,a few cutscenes and the main menu should load but the game itself won't load missions >_"

For quick fix (you have to do it every time you want to play) start the game, then at the menu screen, alt-tab out, cntrl-alt-del, go to processes, pick out thief.exe, alt click it, go to set affinity, then uncheck one of the cpus.

,Aerowixx,2009-01-30T19:23Z,"For me the menus were working every time. But when I started the mission after briefing, it became stuck and game froze. I tried everything from 1 core use to win98 compatibility. 

Then I found out a clue. Someone reported game running too fast etc. The solution is to turn on v-sync. It somehow forces a stable fps. I turned it on from my Ati Catalyst Control Center, and now the game works again. Also forcing screen refresh into 60mhz may work.

,PaddyCM1,2009-05-14T13:57Z,Scrap that earlier comment about working perfectly. Seemed to work fine for about 15 minutes until it became buggy as hell. Crashes on most loading screens now and just crashes at random places. Seems to be a problem loading voice clips as when the game plays spoken dialogue the game begins to slow down to snailspace and eventually exits to the desktop.

1.) Open the disk (right-click drive and select ""Open"" or ""Explore"")
2.) Right-click ""setup.exe"", highlight ""Send to"" and click ""Desktop (create shortcut)"". 
3.) Right-click this new shortcut on your desktop, hit ""Properties"" and select the Compatibility tab.
4.) Check ""Run in compatibility mode"" and select Windows NT from the drop-down menu. Hit Apply.
5.) Double-click this shortcut.

type in D:\setup -lgntforce (or change the D to E if it's in your E drive.) If you get the NT error, I think you have to actually burn both isos to 2 real cd's to play it, not just mount it. Then once you install it, use his crack to crack it so you don't have to play with the cd in (or i guess you could mount the iso then and then play it.)

Any other copy (crack) I have tried tends to screw up with the game's launching. Also I had to locate a pre-patched thief gold exe. since it was partly responsible for the resolution hiccup. I'll have to keep using the iso for every launch, but that's ok since it's better than not being able to play the game at all. :) "
