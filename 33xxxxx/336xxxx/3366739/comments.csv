,Fredda1970,2005-08-07T17:48Z,This does not look like a DVD
,Ool,2005-08-07T17:59Z,"No, it's a DiVX-encoded AVI of a DVD *RIP.*

(In the absence of a page explaining the terminology I'm assuming the ""R"" in DVDR stands for ""rip.""  Doesn't it?)"
,Heimdal1,2005-08-07T18:27Z,yes ripped from retail dvd not encoded from divx.
,rci,2005-08-07T19:06Z,thanks a lot !! havent seen it for years..
,urbanriot,2005-08-08T08:12Z,"No, I think this is the wrong section.  DVD-R is for DVD backups, iso's, VIDEO_TS or whatever that play in your DVD player. AVI's, DiVX, etc go into the movies section. "
,Tourniquest,2005-08-08T12:35Z,"DVD-Recordable, actually. DUH!"
,Ool,2005-08-09T08:55Z,"Well, I could mention at this point that *my* particular DVD player plays those AVIs just fine, but that's probably not what you meant...

I understand."
,ObiWan1,2005-08-12T14:41Z,Anyone have subs
,ObiWan1,2005-08-15T11:14Z,What about subs? 
,m5g,2008-11-26T06:29Z,seed please!
,Refrigerardo,2009-04-28T16:28Z,"this rip actually does not play in some avi playable dvds.

it runs the sound but not the video. you WILL have to convert it to dvd format if you have this problem."
,Refrigerardo,2009-05-01T04:29Z,"when you convert it to dvd using ConvertXtoDVD it changes the aspect ratio literally squashing the image.

anyone know how to avoid that?

Ive been trying my best to play with the settings to no avail. please help!"

DVD-R or DVD+R, the R doesn't stand for rip !

This should go in the Video > Movies category !!"
