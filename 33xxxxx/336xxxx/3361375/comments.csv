,Cpt. Planet,2005-07-27T16:37Z,hey i got a quick question. I use nero to burn CDs but how do I burn .img's that need to be put on a DvD. Nero doesn't have the option. Is there a program that lets me do this? Please someone help me out.
,-PANDA-,2005-07-27T23:56Z,"Sorry Only The Movie No Subs And Extra :

1. Download Deamon Tools (google it)
2. Mount the .img file and make a copy from the extra dvd drive you have in my computer

:) hope this will help"
,Woxxy,2005-07-28T04:06Z,"Cpt. Planet: In nero, choose burn image. You are asked to enter a filename, just type *.img and burn it. .img is the same as .iso.
If you don't trust nero, you can always choose to burn a .img-file with dvd-decrypter (google it) which supports .img natively"
,-PANDA-,2005-07-29T16:58Z,Sorry Guys I´ll Be Back Tomorrow Night Seeding
,Spr1ggan,2005-07-30T08:54Z,"I just wanted to say I love you for putting up a torrent of an iso of this movie, lol. For some weird-ass reason, the .img files that other people were uploading were totally shot and wouldn't burn to a usable dvd.... so hopefully this one will, since it's a format I enjoy.... woot! Thanks!"
,belgerath13,2005-07-30T14:07Z,i'm at 93.6%..........and i'm not getting a download anymore.....anyone else having this problem?

,-PANDA-,2005-07-31T02:08Z,are you just burning the iso or are you monthing the iso file so you´r getting .vob .ifo and so on?
,belgerath13,2005-07-31T10:06Z,mounted with daemon
,-PANDA-,2005-07-31T14:41Z,It works Fine for me :)
,Spr1ggan,2005-07-31T23:11Z,"Actually I'm having the same problem. What are you guys recommending to do? I have tried mounting then ripping to another .iso (for some reason), I've tried burning that iso with diff files, I've tried all sorts of crap.... how do I do it? Please and thank you! :)"
,-PANDA-,2005-08-01T00:27Z,I Have No problems with mounting the ISO and burning it.. can you describe what the problem is ? it want play on your dvd or what you have remembered the AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS folders right?...
,belgerath13,2005-08-01T20:58Z,i mounted with daemon tools...and burned an exact copy of it.....3 times with 3 different programs.....works fine in Pc....won't run at all on home DVD player though
,levve_90,2005-08-03T15:19Z,"Någon som vet ifall den funkar till PS2???

,-PANDA-,2005-08-04T01:36Z,Hvis alle dine andre film gør må den her jo også gøre det.. prøv ad :) jeg har ikke personligt prøvet
,Strict,2005-08-08T11:03Z,For the guy that asked about the .img : Just rename it to .iso and voila =p
