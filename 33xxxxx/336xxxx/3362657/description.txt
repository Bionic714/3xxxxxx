[ End Notes ]

The tracks were encoded at maximum quality, so the files are quite large.

This is a beginners/intermediate exercise compact disc for drummers.  You could also crop 

the beats to form other tracks if you're into beat design; or just listen to it because it's 

funny to hear Carmine talk between exercises.

Keep fit and have fun! ^_^
