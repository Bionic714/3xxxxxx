Description:

four-O-four is a new-comer project from beck's town, germany. 
the projects consists of two people: 
tox, who's doing the music and some lyrics and phönix who's singing most of the songs. 
 
the four-O-four homepage has the following description for their album: 
"why ?illusion?? 
 
is life an illusion which never stops? sometimes it feels like. 
this album is dedicated to several people I've met in my life. some of them vanished quite soon, some of them always come back. you never know how life plays with you. 
life is a magic theater, you know parts of the show, but there will always be something you wouldn't have dared to imagine, not even in your most joyful dreams. 
sometimes you feel like it's an illusion."
