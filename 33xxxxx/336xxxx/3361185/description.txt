This is dark, atmospheric, organfilled proto-sabbathesque Italian prog-rock of very high quality. These guys were heavily into err.."theological-philosophical and esoteric observations", more commonly (and wrongly, perhaps) labeled satanism. Their music was supposedly recorded during seances. Now _thats_ beeing hardcore.. Essential listening for everyone with the slightest interest in goth, metal, prog, hardrock or simply Good_Music. Originally printed in 310 copies, but not a single one was sold. Thank god it was reissued on CD. :D

From www.blackwidow.it:

"Finally available long time buried explosive material from 1969 never released before!!!!this is a real killer the legendary material recorded by Jacula in an English castle in 1969 is finally back from the
grave never released before songs are similar to the ones released on their masterpiece "Tardo Pede" but this time, along with their classic "pipe-organ versus percussions" sound, you'll find doomy guitar riffs a l√† Tony Iommi a must have!!!"
