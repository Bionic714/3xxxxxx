PSP installment in Namco's long-running racing series. The launch title for the platform offers single race, world tour, multiplayer and options. Time attack lets you select a course and race against a ghost car in order to beat your times. Single race takes place against twelve other racers. Options lets you customize settings and play through a few mini games (such as Rally X) and access an "AV Theater" where you can watch replay style races with the computer as the driver. World Tour is the main mode of focus for the single player Ridge Racers experience, and there seems to be a whole lot to it. Choose from a number of pre-set tours that take you through multiple race sessions set on different tracks. You can also have the game generate a tour randomly. Races are set up like a cup in other race games, with each race held separately. You need to clear a certain position in order to advance through the tour.
