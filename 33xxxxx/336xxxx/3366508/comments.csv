,jingleking,2006-05-24T10:00Z,Please seed. Pleeeaase!!! I've got the first one on vinyl and it's the duck's nuts. Can't wait to hear the other tracks!!!
,jingleking,2006-05-25T15:20Z,"Ok. The reason this DL has no seeds is that the original DL is missing 0.2% of the file. This is a tiny chunk of one song, so download the other good stuff anyway. Just delete that track before you play it or burn it. Probably just some digital shananigans. Thanks for the rest test78. (Hope that corrupted track wasn't too bitchin'!!!   :D)"
,jbean27,2009-04-06T15:04Z,I've been hopin' to get the last 0.2% for about a month. Should I give up hope?
