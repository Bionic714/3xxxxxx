Well quid246. Somenone won't believe anything, even if it's straight before thier eyes"
,Ninja_McAwesome,2005-07-25T02:05Z,"poopman, there is no actual evidence (moving or still) in this video to show any kind of proof of an explosion under the tube carriage, just a video version of the news site that documented his story:

http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/region_wide/2005/07/11/83e33146-09af-4421-b2f4-1779a86926f9.lpf

So there's nothing ""straight before my eyes"" as you so eloquently put it. All there is is an account from this one person. Maybe his recollection is slightly marred due to the effects of the bomb exploding near him. Maybe the reporter documented it incorrectly, or maybe I'm completely wrong and he is actually telling the truth. Until there's visual evidence proving his words to be true, this is bullshit.


How about this? The guy in question is a dancer. When interviewed about the attack he says something slightly different from the ""norm"" which can be misconstrued to sound like a bomb was under the carriage, not inside it. People talk about this and him too, finding out who he is and what he does. When he recovers he can promote his dancing skills and make tons of money off of his new-found fame...


Conspiracy theorists jump on anything and everything, don't they?"
,gregorius,2005-07-25T19:44Z,"compared to most conspiracy 'theories', reality is much more amazing and even more incredible! or can you explain why people like reagan, bush, kissinger, helmut schmidt etc. are sitting at a place like bohemian grove, where rituals are held with simulation of child burning etc. - for some dark god called 'moloch'? i can't and didn't take for serious anything of all that stuff, until i found about it in schmidt's (yes, the former german bundeskanzler, the one who allowed americans to bring in cruise missiles in the 70s) biography 'men and powers', where he writes about bilderberg too...sure he does not write about the rituals, but that he was there, together with the most powerful people of the world's elite, his strangest encounter with american culture etc. - i think this guy is very far from being a conspiracy theorist and nobody but politicians ever read his book! so perhaps you should check things first before discrediting all the so called conspiracy theories...perhaps begin with the '911 in plane site' and just watch the first 25 minutes, that should be enough!"
