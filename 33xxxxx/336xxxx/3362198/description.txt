Jaws PDF Creator can be used in several modes. It is seen as a printer in the Windows® or Macintosh® Printing System allowing users to 'print' to a PDF file directly from any application and it also appears as an icon on the desktop allowing drag-and-drop conversion of any PostScript® or EPS file directly to PDF. For Windows users, a toolbar icon installs in Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, allowing any business user to easily create PDF files. The toolbar icons can also be used to retain document structures such as bookmarks and hyperlinks from the original document.
With Jaws PDF Editor, you can significantly accelerate your review cycles using powerful commenting tools, while protecting the integrity of your source document. Jaws PDF Editor also allows you to easily insert, extract, delete and rotate, and re-order pages from multiple PDF files to produce one PDF file.
