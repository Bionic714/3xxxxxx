Thanks! gonna keep seeding"
,jf_fox,2010-02-11T02:03Z,"Hi Everyone!

This is all the information you need to install and play this game. I have played MW4 Veng + Mercs since year 2000. I am very excited about the 511(and growing) leechers and the activity of this torrent.

First, let me say that you do not want to crack this game, simply follow these instructions.

OK. Here we go.

First thing, you mount the MW4_CD1.ISO file in daemon tools or a similar program of your choice. (I use Daemon Tools version 3.47 on xp)

Check all of the emulation options on, aswell as the LockDLL option, taskbar icon and automount.

When you install the game, use the default directory if at all possible, and make sure to do the ""Full Install"" and not express.

Next, this solves the issue of ""Missing CD"" that some of you seem to be having. After you have installed the game, go to start, run..., type ""regedit"" (without the quotation marks), click OK, click on the + next to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, then SOFTWARE, then MICROSOFT, then Microsoft Games, then click on the MechWarrior Mercenaries folder, double-click on the word(registry key) that says CDPath, check the drive letter that your virtual drive is using and make sure the Value data: is the same drive letter. 

Also, make sure the .ISO file you have mounted is MW4_CD1.ISO and NOT CD2.

Download the Microsoft PR1(Point Release 1) Patch. Here is the link: http://www.mechwarrior4.net/Downloads/mercpr1.exe

After installing the PR1 patch, run the game, you will see an autoconfig and EULA agreement, click Accept. Once in game click New to create a new pilot config, don't create any mechs, just go to instant action and hit launch. Hit Space to skip the video and stay in game for at least 20 seconds, and make sure to shoot the ground or something. What this does is enable the PR1 props.mw4 and textures.mw4 files.

Then hit the ESC key and click Quit To Desktop. Now download this file:
http://www.mektek.net/forums/index.php?automodule=downloads&req=get&f_id=29814d9f8e828710d9a1af9de835d0f12fb

And this file:
http://www.mektek.net/forums/index.php?automodule=downloads&req=get&f_id=30414d9f8e828710d9a1af9de835d0f12fb

Apply the MP3.02a patch(290MB), this patch will appear to freeze mid-way, but DO NOT close it, just leave it alone and let it do its thing. If you happen to have issues with it, then repeat the process of launching into instant action and shooting, or possibly reapplying PR1, but I've never had any problems after launching into PR1 and then applying the MP3.02a patch. It primarily patches props.mw4 and textures.mw4, aswell as core.mw4, so as long as these files in your mw4 mercs directory are patched to PR1 then the MP3 patch will work.

Next, apply the MP3.02b patch. You are now up to the current state of the game, you also have an additional 50+ new mechs and weapons to choose from.

In order to play online, you need to go to your MW4 Mercenaries directory located on your hard drive, this is where you chose to install the game, default location is: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Mechwarrior Mercenaries

Double-click on the file mekmatch.reg, this will add a registry key to your system that replaces zonematch, which is no longer supported by Microsoft. Now you will be able to see multiplayer servers, make sure you have your connection set up properly in-game, it should have the Zonematch box checked and your correct connection type selected.

In order to avoid server connecting issues, I recommend you set your router to DMZ mode, or at the very least add an exception to your firewall for the program MechWarrior Mercenaries. I would say disable all firewalls, that is one way, but you can also if needed add the ports required as forwarded in your router and/or firewall(s). MW4 Mercs requires DX Port and several other ports be opened in order to play, but test the game and see if it works before trying this.

You're almost done!

Downloaded these Map Packs, which includes all the classic maps from MechWarrior 4 Vengeance and Black Knight Expansion.

,DaytonMoreton,2010-02-24T04:09Z,"Hey jf_fox i've followed your instructions as you've stated above but am still having a major problem.  I have installed the game successfully using Daemon tools.  The very first time I launched the game through the play now tab after installing it, it successfully launched.  I then launched an instant action game as you directed in your tutorial.  After this I exited the game with the exit tab.  When I went to re-launch the game after exiting it I noticed that the picture associated with the mechwarrior 4 launch tab in the start menu had changed to an unidentified one.  I then launched disc one through Daemon tools but the ""Missing CD"" error message appeared.  I that the disc drives match in the run routine you stated also.  They are both set to G.  Another thing I should mention is that I downloaded each mech pack after mechwarrior would refuse to launch.  After I installed each mech pack I would be able to launch mechwarrior but each time I exited mechwarrior it would not let me re-launch it."
,sogortheogre,2010-02-27T08:25Z,I'm having the exact same problem as Dayton.

,torashin,2010-03-03T18:41Z,After much trouble i got this game working... once! After that it just crashes after the intro movie. I have reinstalled it countless times can anyone help?
,jf_fox,2010-03-07T15:39Z,"@torashin: can you provide more information about the error when it crashes or what happens

@Dayton: make sure securom, safedisc, laserlock and rmps options are selected in daemon tools. also confirm that the ISO you are mounting is MW4 DISC 1.

If you are having problems launching the game, or with the game crashing, run the autoconfig located at start>all programs>microsoft games>mechwarrior mercenaries>autoconfig. The game likes to set itself to ultra high, set it to medium and click continue.

There is another patch I didn't mention in my last post, which is more of a simulation/role-playing league.

See what this league has to offer and download the NBT HardCore update which is very fun.

http://netbattletech.com/

The NBT HC patch is located here: http://www.netbattletech.com/download/gameclients/NBT-Updater.zip

it patches right over pr1 or mp3.02b without modifying your current version, it allows you to select which version to launch.

Hope I helped, see you on the battlefield. In NBT HC I am {CYT}Kronic"
,Khaydri,2010-03-08T08:01Z,"jf_fox. I got as far as installing PR 1 and then the game keeps telling me I don't have the right CD key, even though CD 1 is in, and it's set to drive G:/ which is the virtual drive the disk is in..."

do you have updated direct x/video card drivers ?
