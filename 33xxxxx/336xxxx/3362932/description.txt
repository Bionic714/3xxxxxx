Man, Japan had some scene back in the early seventies. Fromage, Foodbrain, Chronicle, Flower Travellin' Band and Flied Egg. These guys must have had a sense of humor to pick a name like that. ^_^ THis is a fine example of early seventies Japanese rock, the first album on this 2fer has a more psychedelic edge to it and is probably the bands best album. The second album also from 1972 (originally on Vertigo) is a monster mixing up Free and Sabbath on the half live half studio affair. The bassist Masayoshi Takanaka went on to play guitar in lots of other japanese bands, and is quite famous in Japan.
