  Imagine a world populated by toons. Living, breathing toons, that 
  exist in a completely cartoon-rendered universe. These toons go to 
  work, pay taxes, walk their toon pets and watch TV. The age of a 
  toon, or the particular part of the world that the toon comes from, 
  is apparent from his appearance and attitude. As an example, old  
  toons appear in black and white. Asian ?toons appear in the manga 
  style. Certain toons are stylish and slick, while others are gross 
  and disturbed. In this world, some toons are politicians, some 
  collect garbage, some trade stocks, and a select few get work as 
  actors on cable television shows.  

  This is our game universe, where the most popular TV show is Cel 
  Damage. If you can imagine American Gladiator crossed with a cartoon 
  Demolition Derby, you get a pretty good idea of what the Cel Damage 
  show is all about. Each of the six main cast members drives a unique 
  vehicle, and all are playable in the game. The game action allows 
  for play styles that mimic the different competitive matches 
  presented to the TV audience. There are flag rallies, death matches 
  and gate relay races. All the play styles are aggressive, as each 
  cast member has access to a broad range of vehicular toon weaponry. 
  It is the unrestricted use of these weapons by the characters on 
  one another that makes the TV show popular, and the game action 
  exciting. And, because toons never die, it doesnÂ´t matter how many 
  times the cast members are blasted apart during the show 
  (i.e., in a game), they keep coming back for more. 


  We tested this game on a developer XBOX, and it works.  Since there is 
  no mod chip yet, we have no idea if this release will work on retail 
  XBOXes when/if a mod comes out.  However, now that there is a release, 
  a modchip developer will be inclined to get our releases to work, so 
  we think a future mod will work with this release. 

  If a game is small enough to be burned to a CD, you can burn it to  
  either a CD or DVD, at your option, using the same ISO file.   
  The Xbox does not use media checks like the PS2.  

  When burning to a CD, if your CD burning program has an option,  
  choose "MODE1/2048", exactly as if you were burning a PC CD-ROM. 
  We recommend PrimoDVD for burning Xbox for both CD and DVD, but  
  all CD writing software besides Clone CD should work fine. 

  From our experience, the retail Xbox can only read DVD-RWs 
  and CD-RWs, so if you want to be sure that these will work 
  with a future mod, we recommend burning them to Rewritable 
  discs. We have heard reports of the retail Xbox reading some 
  types of DVD-R discs, but we have been unable to verify this.
