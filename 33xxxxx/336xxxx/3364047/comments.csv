,crossmr,2005-08-09T19:59Z,"saitanh, your point? This game is good.  Much like playing turn based battletech on the PC.
Don't be such a superficial little nutsack."
,lastdreamer,2006-02-23T23:57Z,"Anyone can seed this game, please? I've been searching it for a while!!!"
,nakata_i,2006-05-09T12:17Z,"Agreed, crossmr. Too many noobs these days can't recognise a good game if it didn't have 64x FSAA @ 2048x2048 and hit them between the legs with a jousting lance."
,nakata_i,2006-05-20T16:45Z,"Guys, grab the class rip-prtti.ace (32Mb) from the edk network (use the latest emule plus) - rip = no intro, or grab the 470Mb cue/bin pair marked razor1911/x-gamers/sharereactor."
,nakata_i,2006-05-20T16:46Z,"This games ownz0rz j00. None of that kiddy ""class C, class B, class A, class S"" Final Fantasy kiddy style progression shit - HUNDREDS of mechs or design your own. Your pilots even gain exp and increase skills."
,nakata_i,2006-05-20T16:48Z,"If you loved the tabletop or the Battletech game, this game will rock your world, it gets a fucking A on all counts. Too bad no big budget."
