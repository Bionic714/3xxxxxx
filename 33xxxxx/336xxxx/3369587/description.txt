'My summer of love' is based on a novel by Helen Cross. The film just made me so happy and so sad in turns; I just wanted to share it with you girls. It won the British Academy Film and Television Arts award last year and the Alexander Korda award for best British film. No wonder; it's unusually good, not only by British standards but by Western standards, I think.

Working-class Mona (Natalie Press) lives with her brother who used to be a real violent and dangerous man but now has turned to Christ. Mona, confused about her life-situation, wants her brother back the way he was before, because she would recognize life better that way. That's when she meets upper class Tamsin (Emily Blunt), and on she is on her way to self-realization?
