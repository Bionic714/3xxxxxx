,knickelidick,2005-08-14T17:43Z,"""I just wanted to share it with you girls.""

And how about us Boys? ;-)

And btw, thanks for High Art! It was an exellent movie. :)"
,L_Langster,2005-08-14T20:32Z,I've got Bittorrent Shadow experimental. I'll leave it on UNLIMITED after downloading the film. I feel like a geek having to ask all this stupid questions but otherwise I don't learn.......
,Fredrika2,2005-08-14T21:12Z,"knickelidick: I'm sorry about that, I don't really intend to exclude you boys from these films; I just don't think of boys very often. Glad you appreciated High Art. It's a disturbing film, with the life the ""upstairs"" people lead, but the love is so beautiful and the final scene kind of promises there will be love again some day."
