It can be anyone...and you are allowed to defend yourself as well, incase a lottery winner has secretly picked YOU as the target.  It would make the world a better place...there would be far less assholes on the planet.  Everyone runs their mouth, and it makes, but they don't realize the ""butterfly effect"" it has on the world.  I'd like to take 90% of the world, and melt them down in a fucking oven.  Pure distilled liquid hate...you can't push that shit down with chemicals...I try that every day...it doesn't do shit but come rushing out like a severed aorta when a sword is withdrawn from the torso...like now...when the chemicals run thin.  It's like the junk yard dog, who lunges at people through a fence most of his life, and if you were to take that fence away...then what?  Does he stand there barking, not knowing what to do? Or is there a bloodbath the likes of which the world has never known?  I'd go with the second...deranged...yes, I've always been insane...what is insane though? Is it what AA and NA tell you? Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results?  Yeah, I think that is insane.  Fucking sick of lies, and bullshit, the only thing that I can count on is steal...ahh the riddle of steal...is that Odin's breath on causing me gooseflesh, or is it the fear of the blade that has been hanging over my head for the last year?  Chills are chills...god is a fucking cunt."

For future rips I ask: could you to include a text-based sub file in addition to (or as a replacement for) VobSub?"
