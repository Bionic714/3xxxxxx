This was a nice little film.  I've got a lot of requests to encode my own version of this, despite the fact that at one time, there were already 3 versions of this film on TPB.

***There are TWO audio tracks, SWEDISH or ENGLISH COMMENTARY ;)***

Optional external ENGLISH subs in VOBsub format.

Mini Plot:

This Ingmar Bergman film explores the disillusionment of an elderly physician, Professor Isak Borg, as he reflects upon his life and begins to perceive his mortality. As he travels to Lund to receive an honorary award after 50 years of medical practice, he finds himself repeatedly affected by intrusive dreams and hallucinations that expose his darkest fears. He slowly comes to realize that the choices he made in the past have created a cold and empty life, devoid of real meaning or value. Finally, he achieves redemption and reintegration through forgiveness and the love of his family.
