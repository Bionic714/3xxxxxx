,bam359,2005-08-06T08:04Z,"I was about to say that I was expirenceing the same thing, but in the last few minutes, I have been downloading at around 100K (I am at 65% now).  I also will be seeding as much as my traffic restrictions allow."
,Rickler,2005-08-06T08:34Z,if it suppose to be 'more legal' to download/upload something if it is rar in parts?
,bam359,2005-08-06T08:59Z,"""'more legal"", no.  From what I gather having asked the same quetion before, most files origionate on usenet, the maximum file size on there is 14 or 15MB, so big files are ziped and broken up. ((82% complete, there should be some more seeds soon))"
,Jango,2005-08-06T09:28Z,I wonder why the post copied itself over 4 of my older posts... strange bug... I just reloaded the page
,minstryofsnd,2005-08-06T09:41Z,"Why don't you stop bitching and download it from somewhere else, within 10minutes there will be atleast 50completes and hopefully half of them will stay and seed."
,bam359,2005-08-06T09:45Z,"Interesting idea, where did you get it from?"

,lennart84,2005-08-06T11:31Z,What have happened to Atlantis and BSG? They usually come up at around the same time.
