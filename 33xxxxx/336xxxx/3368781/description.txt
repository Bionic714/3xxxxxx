Krayzie_SC-NTSC_Ndure_Installer_v1.0


This installer installs the Ndure exploit along with nkpatcher 10 and the Evolution x or UnleashX dashboard. There will also 
be an install of a complete Virtual C drive and a virtual Eeprom. The virtual C will be set up with an unmodded MSdashboard 
so it can be used without problems. The Virtual files are hidden on the real C drive and cannot easily be altered or deleted.
The Ndure exploit has the ability to load up to a stock state by using the eject button from where you could launch a retail
game and access live. However you will have no access to any network settings or the live dashboard in this state.
If you do want Live dashboard access you can switch the mod off temporary using this exploit.
You could also launch retail games by loading them from bootup and access live that way. 
Either way of going live you are always able to receive game updates.

I can understand this readme is a bit long so I will put *****'s above and beneath the lines EVERYBODY should read before 
using this installer.




First:
*****************************************************************************************************************************
The installer only works on dashboard version 5960 (current latest dashboard). You can check your dashboard version by going
into the settings tab and select system info. Watch the D: number on the bottom of the screen beneath the scrolling text.
If the dashboard is too low you can upgrade by accessing the live tab in a recent Xbox live game or by connecting to the live
server.

Also the installer might not function properly if there are leftovers from previous exploits on the C partition. It will 
however not interfere with folders like apps and games.

The Installer will backup the C partition of your Xbox in the installation process. Therefore it's needed to have at least
200 MB of free space on the E partition (12,800 blocks). This should normally be available with any Xbox but some people like
to fill up their entire harddrive with songs or downloadable content. When doubting check the memory tab.
*****************************************************************************************************************************



Installation:

Installation:
The saves come zipped up for direct use on Action Replay devices. If you don't use Action replay you need to unzip first.
Note that many Action Replay cards corrupt large saves which results in a black or error 21 screen. Solution would be to use
a small gamesave exploit to grant access to the hd and copy this save to the E:UDATA folder via ftp. Or use another memory
card.

Copy the save to the Xbox HD using the known ways. (via memory unit, USB device or hotswap) 
Load the save through the exploited game and follow the on screen instructions.
The user is forced to first select the eeprom backup function prior to the installation.



Main setup screen:
These options become available by entering the installer the first time:


Backup eeprom:

You can use this to create an eeprom backup without having to install the whole softmod. Remember in order to return the Xbox
to its original state you need to remove the eeprom backup. You can use the remove eeprom backup function to do this.
*****************************************************************************************************************************
!!!You need to backup the eeprom before you install the softmod!!!
*****************************************************************************************************************************

Install Softmod:

This is the option to install the Ndure softmod. You will be prompted throughout the install to select whether to install 
Nkpatcher.06 or .67 (select the help file in case you don't know what this means). Also a choice of dashboard has to be made
Choices are Evolution X or UnleashX. The dashboard can be replaced afterwards to any dashboard you like.


Restore from rescue disc:

You can use this option if the Xbox won't boot up properly anymore without retail discs inside and you want to restore. You
need to enter your kernel version to use this option. If you don't know your kernel you should choose "generic".
More information about the rescue disc later on in this readme.


Switch menu:

This option is for those that removed or messed up their save after installing the softmod and want to return to the modded
menu. This should not be used if you didn't already install this softmod.


Settings:
*****************************************************************************************************************************
This is for people who would like to adjust their network settings or screen calibration. Remember when you ftp in from this
screen there are no virtual protections so be aware.
*****************************************************************************************************************************


*****************************************************************************************************************************
Modded menu:
These options become available after the mod. You need to load this through your exploitable game if you want to enter this
menu for the first time.
*****************************************************************************************************************************

Switch softmod on/off:

With this option you can switch the softmod off so you boot to a retail state. In this state you have full live dashboard
options. There will still be modded files on the hd so don't use this if you want to revert your Xbox to stock.


Remove softmod:
This option is divided in two:

-Restore from HD backup:
This will restore your system from a backup made automatically in the install process. This backup is located in 
E:backupsC drive
*****************************************************************************************************************************
DO NOT SELECT THIS OPTION IF NO SUCH DIRECTORY EXITS ON YOUR E DRIVE OR YOU CHANGED THE CONTENTS.
*****************************************************************************************************************************

-Restore from Rescue disc:
This will restore from a pre-made rescue disc. e.g. when the HD backup is missing. You need to enter your kernel version to 
use this option. If you don't know your kernel you should choose "generic". 
More information about the rescue disc later on in this readme.


Restore MSdash after dashupdate:

This option will restore your MSdash after a dashupdate in dual-retail or in switched off mode. Only use this if your
MSdash is infunctional in dual-retail or switched off mode.


Extras:
This option has all the goodies inside which you could optionally use to personalize/configure your softmod.

Multiboot:
There are several multi boot options. I will explain each one of them.
--dual retail: This will let you boot to your MSdash when powering on with the eject button. In this state you can safely 
  access live.
--dual save: This will let you boot to this menu when powering on with the eject button.
--dual altdash: This will let you boot to an alternative dashboard when powering on with the eject button. After selecting
  You can put a dashboard inside E:dashboardaltdash (folder is created automatically). 
--tri save: same as dual save but now with tri boot. Tri boot let's you insert a disc after powering on with the eject button
  and automatically closes the tray. If there's a disc in it will boot the disc. If not it will boot the save.
  The disc must be signed with the habibi key. The rescue disc is pre- signed. Remember that when accessing the Xbox from 
  within the disc or the save there are no virtual protections.
--tri altdash: same as dual altdash but this time with tri-boot. (see option above).

Install DVDX2:
This will install an Xbox DVD movie player. The dashboard is preconfigured to use it right away.

VGA options:
Three options are available:
--SoG: This patches the kernel video output to VGA SoG signal.
--Progressive: This patches the kernel to change video mode to 480p whenever application requests 480i mode.
--Disable VGA: This will return the video output to normal.
The VGA will work on both the normal and the alternative dashboard. Be aware that this functions might not work with some 
games.

Format F drive:
This formats the f partition. 

Tweak fonts:
If you sometimes experience boot problems (stuck at logo screen with white text) you could fix that by setting a kernel
specific font. This requires you to select the right kernel version.

Clear cache:
Sometimes the cache can't do its job anymore cuz it's filled with interfering and/or write protected files.
This will result in games not loading or hanging. This option will take care off that.
(cache is cleared automatically while installing also)

end of extras



Settings:

This is for people who would like to adjust their network settings or screen calibration. Remember when you ftp in from this
screen there are no virtual protections so be aware.

end of modded menu



Couple of things you should know:

*****************************************************************************************************************************
The default network settings is set to DHCP (automatic receive IP from router). If you don't have a router or just wish to 
have a static IP you need to adjust that in BOTH the dashboard and the installer menu otherwise it won't be active on retail
(cold)boots and you won't be able to log into live.

The exploited save itself belongs on the hd at any time. It's an important safety backdoor for when anything goes wrong and 
it will save you from (hot)swapping your hd. So therefore it's recommended to not delete it.

It is very recommended to copy the eeprom backup to the pc and keep it safe as soon as possible.
*****************************************************************************************************************************

You can replace the dashboard to any dash you like by replacing the files in the E:dashboard folder. Make sure its xbe is
named default.xbe. In case this goes wrong it will boot to the installer's menu instead. In case that isn't present also it
will boot to a rescue dashboard located on the real C (thus hidden). In this dashboard you have very limited options.
(only a launch disc and settings options to adjust ftp settings).




Rescue Disc:

This may be nice to recover from messed up systems (or even to set up bigger hd's). 
In your rescue disc folder you will find three folders which you can use to put files in:

C drive: In this folder you should put the files you wish to use to replace the C contents. This could either be stock files
(from HD backup, slayer's AID disc etc.) or it could be modded files (gathered from pc backups in modded state).

E drive: In this folder you should put the files you wish to use to replace the E contents. This could either be stock files
(savegame folders: TDATA and UDATA) or it could be modded files (gathered from pc backups in modded state).

Dashboard: In this folder you could put a dashboard in case the dashboard on the Xbox is gone or damaged. the dashboard 
folder on E will be replaced by the dashboard folder on this disc. You can put any dashboard in here as long as it's 
executable is named default.xbe


So basically:


To recover to stock:

Put stock files in C drive folder.

Fill the E drive folder with the UDATA and TDATA backups from your Xbox. If you didn't back them up you could try to get ftp 
access prior to using this option and ftp over the UDATA and TDATA folder from your Xbox. If you don't have or want any 
backups you could just leave the UDATA and TDATA folders empty. There should be no folders other then TDATA and UDATA present
if you are reverting to stock.

In the disc menu choose the restore system option.


To recover to modded state:

Put full C drive backup from modded unprotected state in C drive folder. (You can get the full C drive files by ftping in 
from the gamesave installer's menu).

Put full E drive backup in E drive folder.

In the disc menu choose the restore system option.


To recover dashboard

Put dashboard in dashboard folder. (dash's xbe named default.xbe)

In the disc menu choose the restore dashboard option.


Setting the network settings: (in case you want ftp access)

You will have to do this prior to burning the disc because they can't be edited while running from disc. Default is set to DHCP.
To do this open the xml file and edit the network settings to your likings.



Burning the disc:

Make an Xbox iso from the Rescue disc folder. You can use any Xbox image creator app for this. 
I prefer Qwix (http://www.teamavalaunch.com/qwix/).
Then burn the iso as an image using any disc burning app.
!!!Make sure you use discs you know your Xbox can read!!!



That?s all ;)


Thanks to everybody supporting me and my previous installers. If it wasn't for the great responses I wouldn't have made this
one. 

Special thanks to the coders, tools producers and other people involved in making the exploits to the stable standard of 
modding it is now.(The xbox-linux crew, Rmenhal, Angerwound, Pedrospad, Devz3ro, ldots, dr oldschool, xman954, DaddyJ, 
Triggernum5, kingroach, Eh, Cio and anyone else I might have forgotten).

More thanks to all the peeps visiting the Exploits forums on a regular base and share their knowledge with others.



Have fun
