Review by Thom Jurek (www.allmusic.com):

Here are two CDs containing 40 tracks -- all of Creedence Clearwater Revival's singles along with album cuts -- selected and sequenced by European rock journalist Lennart Persson, an intimate of John Fogerty. The big pluses are that these tracks are the remastered versions (in 24 bit), the sequencing is unique and provocative, and the music itself, as you already know if you are reading this, is killer. This is arguably a better issue than the American Chronicle series because of the new dimension added by not placing tracks chronologically.
