This is the complete collection of "audiofucks" of Mohammed Bouyeri's speech at the trial for his murder of Theo van Gogh where he got life without parole. It is based on an "accidentally" transmitted segment that apparently was not intended for public consumption. It can also be downloaded from geenstijl.nl.
