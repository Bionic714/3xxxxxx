,baban13,2005-07-25T16:47Z,"Yeah, 128kbps (mp3) is really not good quality. If You want good quality with mp3 You shoud start with LAME -preset standard ( VBR ~ 200 kbps ) or stick with Ogg ( quality 6 or higher ) or Musepack (profile standard or higher ). The last is probably best solution. Cheers !"
