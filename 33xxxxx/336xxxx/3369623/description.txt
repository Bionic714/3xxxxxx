Counter-Strike 1.6 full game



Click on the .exe file that you`ve donwloaded and start installing half life 1. When youÂ´ve did that start half life 1 and click on the "Change Game" button, then you will be transferred to Counter-Strike 1.6. But remember, you cannot play online with this one. To do that you will have to register a cd-key to steam and stuffs. So you can only play on LAN or against bots on this one.



Enjoy!
