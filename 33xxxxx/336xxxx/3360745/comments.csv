,generalleoff,2005-07-25T07:01Z,"Title is Model Misbehavior.

It's realy episode 63 of the series, Episdoe 13 of season 4. The production number is 4ACX13.

The offical site kinda sucks and if you want a better source of info use the following.

Just incase you cant find an episode here one day you can always get them here as well (among many other TV shows that dont always show up here).

This is episode 10, not 13. The episode name was right, thats about the only accurate thing about generalleoff's post."

the internal episode is 13. the scene just uses air order vs production order is all. Using production order for releases would just be consufins as hell and everyone would think they missed 3 episodes. Episodes 5 (4ACX05), 6 (4ACX06), and 7 (4ACX07) were skipped over. They are all a 3 part series and episode 1 of the series is going to show next week as air episode #11. My post was not worng it was just showing the level of info regarding the show you can get on tv.com."

,placain,2005-07-26T04:25Z,"This AVI causes Quicktime to crash on my Mac... I played it ok with VLC but it still skips in a few places (for no more than a split second or so, but it's distracting).

Also - what's the deal with people cutting off the end credits? It saves what, two or three mb?"
,Rumpelstilzchen,2005-07-29T01:43Z,Many thanks for the unrared release :)
