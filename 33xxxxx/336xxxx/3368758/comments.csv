If you wan't to upload music then why don't you at least upload  MP3's with 256kb/s CBR, that is the least you could do. I wish that ya'll out there would start uploading FLAC-compressed music it preserves the music without degredation."
,Ramses,2006-01-05T20:29Z,"What's the problem josephus? If you don't want the album, don't download it. Don't whine in the forum about it. It's just retarded to whine on torrents you don't want. Just don't download it ok? It's as simple as that. Tanks jackdeath for the upload!"

,NemkeDude,2007-07-31T00:18Z,"Ramses, you told him well.
Josephus, from now on you'll be called Mr. FLAC.

Uploader, thank you for this great album...

P.s. Some people who never uploaded/made a torrent like to complain, but that is very rude, don't you all think ?"
,2rri,2008-02-04T22:15Z,"I agree with Ramses. Don't like it, close the window without downloading. If you do like it, download, smile when it's finished and upload until you atleast get a 1.0 ratio.

Thx jackdeath"
