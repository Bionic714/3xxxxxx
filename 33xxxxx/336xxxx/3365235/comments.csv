,jediwillow,2005-08-15T17:17Z,"This game did not work for me either. I have 3 coasters now associated with this game. Yes I have a modded xbox...its pal etc.
That is not the problem....I did notice one thing that the xbe file was not patched when the iso was created in the first place. 
I put this game on my xbox hard drive then ripped it back to my computer with craxtion. When I went to create a new iso the program by default patches the xbe file so it can be played on a modded xbox. In this case the file was not patched. Not that it made any differance, it still did not work. Maybe it has something to do with bios versions.
Can you tell me which modchip you are using & your bios version..."
,jediwillow,2005-08-17T10:20Z,if anyone got this game working can you please give us details of your xbox modchip & bios as you can the majority of comments are all saying the same thing..
