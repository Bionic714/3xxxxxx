I just recorded the old vhs of Secret Video Game Tricks, Codes and Strategies Volume 2 on my computer here, and am trying to share it on bittorrent. It's a 250+ meg divx file in a RAR, and if you want to download it please feel free.

Seanbaby makes fun of it here ( http://www.seanbaby.com/nes/video.htm ) so you can get a taste of it before you decide if you want to D/L it or not.

It's pretty bad, but it's interesting to check it out.
