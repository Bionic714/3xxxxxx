,IK,2005-07-26T17:37Z,"If you've played the first Deus Ex, this one is a huge disappointment. That is just to warn you, I bought the game when it came out years ago. Horrible."
[V],Whistler2k4,2005-07-27T01:32Z,"I'm trying to upload as fast as possible. I would need to seed this later on, cus my upload sux (only got 800kbit upload)"

,Scullyy,2006-06-06T20:20Z,"Why can't I mount the iso file with Daemon tools, and btw, how to mount files with Alcohol 120%"
,Scullyy,2006-06-06T20:50Z,"I've tried to mount it with daemon tools and Alcohol 120%, 52% and it keeps saying: Cannot read file, because it's destroyed. (Something like that, mine is in norwegian) Is there a way to do this without burning?"
,Woodenhead,2006-10-02T21:23Z,"Good job seeding. I'm up around 250 kB/s, which is higher than usual. It seems I always get the dial-up seeders lol. I'll seed this one until I hit a ratio of 3. My upload speed can hit well over 200 kB/s..."

,DaySaver,2008-01-28T02:07Z,"The sad fact is, there are a lot of graphics cards that this game won't play on   . . .  like MINE.  "
,BuffetSlayer,2008-02-03T17:25Z,"Hi guys, im new here. I am afraid this torrent does not appear to be complete. This game is heavily reliant on voice acting and unfortunately the sound files for all of the intercom speech and character conversations have not been included. The folders are there but there are no files within them. 

Thanks for the up, but its frustrating that it is not complete. It totally ruins the game experience."
,BuffetSlayer,2008-02-03T18:37Z,"EDIT: My above post was premature. The sound IS present for all of the conversations, even though the folders are all empty. It seems my sound card was having a problem, but a restart later, and the sound works fine.

Thanks a lot for the up! :D"
,Torrent245,2008-04-06T04:03Z,Can I play this by mounting on Daemon Tools?

,tuhvel1,2010-07-04T23:28Z," Good upload. Everything is working great.
Oh and all the negative shit that has been said about this game. True this game sucks. 1st Deus Ex was great but this is complete crap.
Played like half an hour and quit."
,SynisterDAETH,2011-06-28T20:05Z,"I am new to having to do this kind of thing because I am used to Mac where you can just download it and play easy not having to do all the .iso stuff.
