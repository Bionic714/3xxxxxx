,UltraBrazil,2005-08-16T19:39Z,"Attempting to watch this causes Explorer to crash. I can get it to work in the VCL media player (Windows Media Player crashes along with Explorer), but it still shoots Explorer down. Never had this problem with any other film before. Anyone else having this problem with this particular file? I'm using Windows XP."

,TheDeadNextDoor,2011-09-06T03:42Z,"I've seen many stills, and giffs of this movie and I've always wondered what it was called; and as fate would have it I stumbled upon it this evening. Thank you, Juan_Delgado."
,yousef86,2012-08-11T14:56Z,"Great Quality DVD Rip! A/10 V/9!

This film is dark, gory, and is filled with surreal story and effects. If you like David Lynch movies you'll certainly enjoy this.
