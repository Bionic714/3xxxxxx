Dr Who - The Creature from the Pit
Part 2

Metal is practically priceless on the planet Chloris, as it is such a rare object, and when the Tythonian Ambassador arrived wishing to swap metal ore for vegetation, Lady Adastra had it thrown down a pit fearing that such trading would threaten her hold on the population. The Doctor finds a way to communicate with the creature, which explains that there has been such a protracted silence from him communicating with his race, that they have sent a neutron star towards Chloris to destroy it. The Doctor has to join forces with the creature to save the planet.
