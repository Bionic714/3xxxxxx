,Pumpkin Escobar,2005-08-03T13:38Z,"There's another link floating about with 11 Niven & Pournelle novels that includes _The Gripping Hand,_ but not _The Mote In God's Eye._  Anyone know if the latter is available in audio form?"
,P455IN6BY,2008-02-22T01:31Z,"OOOMG, ringworld track 21 is missing!!! please upload someone. I cant belive noboby noticed it."
,iwgf7wfr723tiugf7t9324gd,2008-04-17T13:22Z,"Anyone have the missing part?
It's still not there :-("
,gregsn,2008-05-08T18:26Z,Most of Crashlander is incomplete ... the chapters get half-way through and then quit.  VERY unfortunate.  There is no other copy of Crashlander floating around the torrent nets.  Not that I can find.
,thecow99,2008-09-25T01:09Z,It's possible the first chapter in Ringworld Throne is corrupted. My chapter bounced around several times and even changed narrator!! I've decided NOT to redownload the file and just start another torrent.
,mtsplus,2009-05-14T15:48Z,"Yep, it seems most files in Ringworld Throne are completely useless.

It skips around, leaving out a couple of minutes here, repeating a couple of minutes over and over there, and even switches over to a super sloooowmotion version of some completely different audio book in the middle of everything every other minute.

Worst mess i have heard."
,mtsplus,2009-05-20T15:09Z,"Crashlander is broken too.

The longer chapters are chopped off.
You will only get parts of Flatlander, Grendel, etc.

,Dubba-C,2010-03-01T03:36Z,"Yep, I'm having to read RW Throne and Crashlander to figure out what happened. Bummer. I would not recommend downloading this torrent. More frustration than it is worth. But then, that's what we get for pirating, eh?"
