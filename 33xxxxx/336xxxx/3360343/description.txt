This instuctional film was produced in 1987 by the grandson of the late Grandmaster Yip Man.

It includes some rare footage of Yip Man performing the first two forms of Wing Chun (later to be known as Wing Tsun or Hong Kong style).
The footage is filmed in black and white on a 9mm camera in 1972 (just weeks before his death) so do not expect DVD quality.

His grandson Yip Chun then shows the forms again in diffirent angels and some of it's application.

Forms : Sil Lim Tao and Chum Kiu.
