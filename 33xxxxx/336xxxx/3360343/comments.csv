,zattara,2005-07-28T21:53Z,Thanks man!     Actually did'nt think anyone would be interested but the download ticker is at this time on 138 downloads. :-)   I've got a couple more of Emin Boztepe and some of Leung Ting and some various. I'll see if I can upload this weekend.

ive have been to a couple of his seminars. he teaches the traditional style just as Yip Man taught it to him.

later"

,IAMALLIAM,2009-04-05T18:26Z,"G'day Zattara.

I studied Wing Chun through Rick Spain in Sydney who in turn learnt from William Cheung who in turn learnt from Yip Man. So this is something that I will treasure as part of my own Kung Fu journey.

Thank you for the share mate."
