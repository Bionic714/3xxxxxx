Detta program är då en beta av den kommande SmartEncode som är baserat på OpenSource och kan även hittas på " http://smartencode.beplaced.com/ " men anledningen till att jag lägger upp denna är för att lätta belastningen lite på deras sida.

SmartEncode is an audio ripper and encoder for Windows(tm). 

SmartEncode uses a highly refined form of the former technique, producing audio files that are both of small size and very high quality. 

SmartEncode has three encoding 'types' to suit the needs of the main groups of users. Those that want either the smallest size or the highest quality, and those that like to get a bit of both worlds. A common problem with conventional encoders is the amount of settings and tuning that are left up to the user to set accurately. SmartEncode takes care of all these issues internally, meaning you can leave all the options as they are, and still get great sounding audio.
