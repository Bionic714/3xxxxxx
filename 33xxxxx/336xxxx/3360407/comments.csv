,currysteph,2005-07-25T00:11Z,I dont know the guys name but its the same guy who has read on all the other audio books for Harry  Potter
,ladylestat,2005-07-25T09:54Z,"So you mean it's the American reader, Jim Dale?"
,currysteph,2005-07-25T12:09Z,"Honestly I dont know who the guy is...but on ALL MY  Harry Potter Audio books he is the guy who reads it..So if there are other ""Readers"" I cant tell you who this is or isnt....but he's good and does the different voices for the characters and such..."
,currysteph,2005-07-25T12:10Z,Well dumbass me went back and listened to the beginning of chap 1 and YES it is Jim Dale reading the book.
,mariaj6,2005-07-25T19:33Z,"UÂ´re thinking about Steven Frye. Well, they both speak ""brittish""....."
,Sinatra,2005-07-25T21:33Z,They both speak brittish but there is two versions of the book. And Stephen Fry reads the britt-version. And in my opinion the only version worth listening to :)
,ladylestat,2005-07-26T11:10Z,"I agree that the Fry version is much better. I'm trying to find ANY book 6 read by Fry but so far they just have Dale at this site... There's one person here posting the british versions, and I hope he does #6 also (about a month ago they'd only planned books 1-5)."
,themacguy2k,2005-07-26T16:54Z,From what I gather. the Fry version won't be available until August 25th. This according to Amazon UK and other sites.
,cannew,2005-08-08T02:43Z,Read by Jim Dale and he's always excellant.  Assume Fry is also a favorite from other comments.
,miegapele,2005-08-12T00:21Z,"thx for all, currysteph, we 're really enjoying it - be it Dale or Fry.... ;)"
