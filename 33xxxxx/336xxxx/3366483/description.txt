The Secret is a documentary discussion of the Majestic documents, both their content and importance. It will bring together for the first time both the original controversial MJ-12 documents along with many pages of new documents 
never before seen by the public.

The program combines a riveting collection of archival footage, live-action reenactments, portraits of both past and present personalities and on-camera interviews with many experts, including scientists, astronauts, living witnesses, researchers and investigators. Old arguments against the authenticity of the MAJESTIC documents will be put to rest while new ones may be engendered by the presentation of many new examples, which have been made public through a variety of sources including Cooper, Cantwheel, "S-1", "S-2," and the Legionnaire papers. 

Beginning with significant background material dating back to the end of World War II, the program will trace the evolution of The Secret through the beginning of the Cold War with its atomic secrets, Kenneth Arnold's "flying saucers" and the largely-forgotten Washington, D.C. mass sightings of 1952. Also covered will be the connection of MJ-12 documents to the controversial death of this nation's first Secretary of Defense, Admiral James Forrestal, President Kennedy's request for all CIA UFO files in 1963, and deaths attributed to unearthly cadavers. There is serious consideration of the allegation that the documents are an exercise in psychological warfare or may have been hoaxed by some group for unknown purposes. The program reaches a climax with the presentation of the views, both pro and con, of the many persons who have studied these documents. In the end, with all things considered, this documentary will clearly demonstrate that the official U.S. Government position on UFOs has been a carefully orchestrated deception designed to hide the most extraordinary secret in recorded history.
