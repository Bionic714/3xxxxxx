Thanks for bringing back the memories"
,Kaylas,2005-07-28T03:59Z,"yes, steve austin is cult! maybe I should have mentioned it before.. the sound effects that we know from the series are inapprehensably missing :(
Whatever, getting the story from what every intro of the series states is worth it. :)
