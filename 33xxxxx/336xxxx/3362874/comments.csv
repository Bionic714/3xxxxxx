This Torrent possibly contains a virus. 
It installed properly untill a message box appeared saying that it needed to download drivers that microsoft did not recognise. I assumed that this was a clean Torrent and clicked ""Allow"" then a few seconds later i got a blue screen and a system memory dump message. Windows would not start so I ran system restore to a previous point before i downloaded this torrent and that fixed it. I highly recomend not downloading this Torrent untill it is checked for viruses or compatability issues by the Torrent Creator."
