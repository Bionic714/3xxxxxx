  I looked around a long time for this one but 
        couldn´t find it even in stores.
   But finally i found it and here it is.
  It´s one of my favourite albums with Neil.

The album isn´t what you can expect from the man 
who gave us albums like "Rust Never Sleeps", 
"After The Goldrush" and so on. 
But it sure was a great album to play when
we cruised around in an old Chevy, Buick or so
thinking we where the coolest of the cool ;-)
back in the 80´s.

The cd is ripped at 320 kbit/s and it sound like 
it where recorded in a tincan, but i think it was
made like that to really get the feeling of the 50´s.

My scanner aint so good but i put in some jpegs from
the album anyway, and you can see the tracklist on the back.
 
Ripped with CDex 1.51 and Lame MP3 Encoder 1.3

Enjoy!
