Japan 

Jamie confronts what might be his most formidable challenge yet- the Japanese three string shamisen guitar. The Shamisen itself is difficult enough but Jamie must learn to play this most traditional of instruments with an alternative rock band. Along the way Jamie meets some of Japan? s shamisen-playing legends, including the famous veteran, Yamda Chisato and young electric shamisen virtuoso Hiromitsu Agitsuma. Jamie? s journey to understand and learn the shamisen takes him to Okinawan castles, hot mineral spas and the intimidating environment of Osorezan, a spiritual twilight zone where even many Japanese fear to tread. In the finale, Jamie joins his cohost on stage in a trendy Tokyo music club where he finds out just how well he has-or hasn? t come to grips with the shamisen.
