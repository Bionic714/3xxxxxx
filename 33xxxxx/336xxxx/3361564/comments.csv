,Ubermensch0,2006-12-07T12:27Z,"I am also getting the same error as jackvolgar which is ""error with halo 18 - bonus track 15"".  Maybr you  uberpwnage would like to defend yourself and tell me and the others how to resolve this problem."
,Ubermensch0,2006-12-08T14:30Z,"A response to :::Boomhour :::
The whole file won't download because of the ""error with halo 18 - bonus track 15"" problem.  Apparantly the file name is outside of the parameters, in other words, the file name is to long.  I am unable to change the file name before downloading.  The message usually comes up instantly after I click the download button"
,charfordcharford,2007-01-10T07:13Z,"Get this when I open the torrent. Any input would be great.

I'm thinking this is just because the filename is too long. I'm not sure if other users have had this downloaded completely or not - the comments don't say."
,made-of-technetium,2007-02-18T05:50Z,"FOR ALL THE PEOPLE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH LONG FILENAME:-
If The Filename is too long, Place the torrent on the root of the drive (eg C:/Nine Inch Nails - Complete Collections). If you do that it must fit, afterall it fits on the orig uploaders drive."
,zackfuckedurmom,2007-03-30T01:18Z,"hey douchebags, let's seed hm? people that don't seed ruin these sites."
,streatment,2007-06-02T16:55Z,"hey this works for me i dont know what your talking about.

,siv545,2007-11-15T22:20Z,i'm sorry. There is only one wrong halo number. 
,ZulMonster6,2008-03-03T00:39Z,Can some more people please seed this?  
,OnyxgrinD,2008-05-08T12:27Z,"Nice up. But the NIN's bootleg from 1990 is called ""Hammar Hard"" not ""Hammar Head"""
