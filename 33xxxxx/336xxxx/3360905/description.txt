  Game information :
  ==================
  Avast ye Blunderbussers and Scalawags!

  Quick - what has dozens of monkeys, ghost pirates galore and more insults
  than a cranky parrot? Why, The Curse of Monkey Island, of course! In this
  highly anticipated third installment to LucasArts' popular Monkey Island
  series of graphic adventures, Guybrush Threepwood once again takes up dull
  blade and rapier wit against the nefarious demon-pirate LeChuck. In Curse,
  Guybrush must save his one true love, Elaine Marley, from being turned into
  the evil pirate's zombie bride. But, hoping to marry Elaine himself,
  Guybrush unknowingly slips a cursed ring onto her finger that transforms
  her into a gold statue. He must then find a way to change Elaine back to
  her beautiful self and stop LeChuck from carrying out his sinister plans.
  Aye, 'tis a rollicking piratey adventure that's sure to challenge the mind
  and shiver a few timbers! 

  * Film quality animation, voice, sound and music - the undead come to
    life before your very eyes!
  * Two difficulty settings: regular and Mega-Monkey (now with more puzzley
    goodness)!
  * New and improved insults suitable for swordfights and other fun
    occasions!
  * Vegetarian cannibals and a guy named Snugglecakes!
