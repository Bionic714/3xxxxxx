,Pa3PyX,2011-09-26T07:31Z,"94.189.234.113: Thanks for seeding, but please turn off uTP support in your uTorrent (change advanced settings:bt.transp_disposition from 31 (or 15) to 5). I was only able to download from you when I turned off uTP support in mine.

Normally I'd blame this on my ISP first, but there was another peer (also using uTorrent) who was apparently unable to download from you as well. I get 4 KB/s from you via TCP, but by uTP my client shows downloading (and not choked), but the actual download speed drops to 0 after a few seconds. You have an external IP (able to accept incoming connections) so uTP is largely redundant anyways."
