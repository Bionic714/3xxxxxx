,subliminal_city,2006-09-03T15:08Z,"please continue seedin' 'till I got it down, then I can continue the seeding, I'd really like to get this soundtrack, or perhaps it's just as the bloodlines games, that the songs are included as mp3's in the cd? (don't have the first game, so I wouldn't be able to get the OST anyway)"
