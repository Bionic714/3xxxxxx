Exposure to toxic chemicals--in the workplace and at home--is increasing every day. Human behavior can be 
affected by such exposure and can give important clues that a person or population is in danger. If we can 
understand the mechanisms of these changes, we can develop better ways of testing for toxic chemical exposure 
and, most important, better prevention programs.
This volume explores the emerging field of neurobehavioral toxicology and the potential of behavior studies as 
a noninvasive and economical means for risk assessment and monitoring. Pioneers in this field explore its 
promise for detecting environmental toxins, protecting us from exposure, and treating those who are exposed.
