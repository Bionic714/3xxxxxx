Having to download the windows version to use on my PC, but I'd like to be able to use it on my laptop. ^_^"

Looks good (15 day trial) but cannot figure out ""Copy crack(s) to application directory and overwrite"".
Where are these cracks, and where is application directory??"
,Yoshya,2008-03-14T00:28Z,"Thanks, works like a charm.

to crack, just take the two files inside the /crack folder.. and paste in the installation directory, overwriting the original executables.

For Example.. my installation dir 
""C:\Program Files\Alias\Alias SketchBook Pro 2.0""
.. most likely yours too."

,BluMunkey,2010-09-25T04:36Z,the crack folder is empty
,BluMunkey,2010-09-25T04:37Z,the crack folder is empty. prog works good for the 15 day trial but useless after that.
