,the_cub,2005-08-13T19:20Z,"Thanks to the uploader. Wish you'd have made the torrent correctly though. It's just one big file, gonna take so much longer to download now.

But again, Thank You."
,rounder,2005-08-13T21:31Z,"the_cub: torrent works by hashing the data into small segments that are distributed, so it doesn't matter if it's one or 100 files. the error handling is also good in clients (like in BitLord to name one), so the risc of having to download the lot again because of an error after, let's say, 80% complete is very small. and for most user's it's much easier to just burn a single file and install, or mount a single file and install, instead of fiddle with uncompressing/unRAR, etc. usually you'll se lot's of comments like: 'Help, please, what do I do with these 50 strange files I downloaded?' And so far, not even one question about what to do with the file after downloading, even though this is a very, very popular torrent! So I think it's much better with one big image-file, like this one. This torrent is made correctly, as they should be made :-)"
,anthonymel,2005-08-14T02:12Z,Can you do a complete install and not have to use the DVD when using the program?
,rounder,2005-08-14T07:56Z,"anthonymel, and others: use the application Alcohol 120 to create a virtual drive. then use Alcohol 120 and mount Encarta on that virtual drive. install Encarta from that drive, and keep it mounted. there is no need to burn Encarta to a DVD. just run Encarta mounted from the virtual drive. in Alcohol 120: check mark the option: 'remount images on system reboot' and Alcohol 120 will mount Encarta every time you start your computer, and then you can start Encarta just like you start any other application that resides on your hard disk."
,achkar,2005-08-14T12:15Z,is this in  english ?????????
,wxrkny,2005-08-14T20:08Z,"An encyclopedia's nice, but who uses this all the time?  If you're a student, I guess some of you will, but with all the free stuff online like encyclopedias, dictionaries, etc. why bother opening up a program, especially if you're already online!  Just go to Answers.com!"
,achkar,2005-08-14T20:43Z,do this windows have any security like firewall or something?????
,jnd,2005-08-15T08:58Z,Bahh... Just use wikipedia.org ;-)
,jambo84,2005-08-15T21:26Z,"At least this encyclopedia is something you can trust! That's more than can be said about the web. Especially wikipedia, which can contain lots of errors and misinformation since users can edit the text themselves."
,TheDane,2005-08-15T22:39Z,"It's incredible that the internet can increase peoples stupidity - it ought to increase their ability to access valid information, but instead they take anything for granted. MS Encarta contains a lot of knowledge supplied in a form that's easier to access than the Internet for a lot of people, including my Grandma, so don't mock it. DL it if you like or just don't bother."

The problem with 99% is that IF the uploader changes anything (even adding a comma in a text file) AFTER s/he has created the has file, the hash file will not correspond with the uploaded file(s) and the download will never go beyond 99.9%.
But, if you're saying this is an .iso so how is it possible to change that, then you're right; it can't be altered after it is created.
Here I merely state the fact behind the 99% issue; it's a lesson to ev'ryone that an uploader should NEVER change anything in the torrent folder once the hash file (the .torrent file) is created..."

,anacondon,2008-04-30T17:04Z,"Impossible to install.  Tried 'autorun' - 3 error msg's (cannot find [looks like hkey entries]), tried 'set up' - same 3.  Tried all 'exe' installs - no go.  I give up, (frick) it.  Getting rid of this space-hogging monster.  You guys who were successful - what was the 'secret' I'm obviously missing? (yes - internet connection & firewall/antivirus disabled during installation, etc)  Too bad - Encarta's a great program, when it's able to be INSTALLED."
