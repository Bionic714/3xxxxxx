microchip wanted more Babe Ruth - here it is:)

Good heavy-progressive from England. This is their 1975 albums "Babe Ruth" and "Stealing Home" crammed into one CD. One of the most underrated bands from this era imho. They didnt go for the same rocknroll cliches like a lot of other bands did - which perhaps prevented them from any huge commercial breakthru. They have elements of both jazz and classical mixed in with a more traditional hard rocking sound. The sound of the band is mostly dominated by guitar and some el-piano. Most of the vocals are sung by their female singer Jenny Haan. Bernie Marsden is on guitar, y`all know him from UFO and later Whitesnake.
