Review:

The June 15, 2000, show in Katowice, Poland, is the first of a great two-night stand by Pearl Jam there, during which the band would play 50 different songs. It was documented, along with nearly all the band's concerts in 2000, on a series of official bootlegs mastered by the band. This concert, the 15th on the European tour, shows the band really starting to round into form. The many errors heard in the early shows of the tour have been greatly reduced. The bigger crowd at the first show influences the band to include more popular hits this night than for the smaller crowd the next night. Here, you'll get favorites like "Even Flow," "Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town" (dedicated to all the girls they met there named Magda), and covers of "Last Kiss" by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers and Neil Young's "Rockin' in the Free World." However, the band manages to throw in some numbers that were played less often as well. These songs include "Brain of J.," "Present Tense," and the old "Jeremy" B-side "Footsteps," which was played only twice on the European tour. In all, a very effective concert, but really just a prelude to the classic second night in Poland. ~ Steven Jacobetz, All Music Guide
