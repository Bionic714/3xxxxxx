[ End Notes ]

The tracks were encoded at maximum quality, so the files are quite large.

This is one of my favorite reggae/hip-hop groups from the nineties; it?s not one of those compact discs that only contains one good track: they?re all fabulous! These artists are well known to everyone and led themselves to outstanding careers and are still seen in modern media.

This is a must have album for your personal audio library; enjoy.

Keep fit and have fun! ^_^
