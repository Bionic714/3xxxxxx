,RasztaCsubi,2008-03-03T11:21Z,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OST

i love wiki:)"
,SpartanAK47,2008-07-07T00:05Z,"OST means original sound track
is this the remix version or the very original?"
,Squeakurs,2009-08-23T01:55Z,"Only thing this torrent needs is a readme/something that tells the names of the songs.

Other than that, awsome 100%"
