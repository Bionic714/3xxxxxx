Moonbase Commander

[ Notes ]

This is a very addictive and unique game that was released in the 90's and was very under-rated.

Moonbase Commander brings the fundamentals of games like the Command and Conquer genre, but brings it to a level of simplicity and adds quick replay value with challanges only unique to Moonbase Commander.

The controls are extremely simple but timing is crucial; sort of works like the kick meters in NFL games.

Keep fit and have fun! ^_^
