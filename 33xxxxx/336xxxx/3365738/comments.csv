,boika,2005-08-09T12:03Z,"xm:  I had no problems with AVI. Maybe you should update your codec pack... Check this: http://www.free-codecs.com/download/Codec_Pack_All_in_1.htm

,den myos,2005-08-12T23:00Z,"it need a password to extract

,Alphawolf,2005-08-13T19:01Z,"Downloaded the file, can't get it to work though, what is the missing codec? i've tried with media player and divx  player and neither will work."
,boika,2005-08-14T13:26Z,"Alphawolf, possible you should update your codecs. Just download this Codec Pack and you woun't have any problems with videos :)

,linebackernickle,2006-01-05T23:25Z,Why is there no sound?
,themanalaa,2006-01-06T04:02Z,the code plz
,BDsCZ,2006-05-24T09:13Z,"Whats this? Penetration guide for beginners? The only positive point is, that this bullshit aint got more than 700MBs. Its useless, dont even bother downloadin this. I really dont feel like being the sexmaster of the century, but im pretty sure, that firsl girl around you grab would teach you much much more than this video ... IMO!"
,CraziBroad,2007-11-17T18:15Z,"if you need a better avi player, try gomplayer.com it plays EVERY vid i've dnld'd (45) with out a problem, and if it gives you codec problems you just gotta reset your speaker settings,(back to factory settings) and reboot, easy!, i do it up to 4x's a day LOL so maybe for ME its easy..its routine."
,iisan7,2008-01-17T06:40Z,yeah out of curiosity i downloaded a set of these 'lovers guide' things and it was utter crap. nothing to learn here (and nothing worth watching either)
,tuidayhaha,2008-08-12T09:22Z,"Could you tell me how to download torrent in general. When I click on ""DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT"", then save to disk. The download file only one or two KB in size. This is my first time try to download torrent.

Thanks,

Tuidayhaha "
,funnyguy1234,2008-08-13T11:35Z,"Hi tuidayhaha,
You need a bittorrent client. Try utorrent. 
Please visit
http://www.utorrent.com/
and download.
Install!
Then download this 2kb torrent, what you are talking about.
Download it preferably on the desktop.
Now doubleclick that torrent on desktop.
Voila, you are there. Start downloading now.
This 2 kb torrent you are talking about is just an information file, which tells your computer as well as the central server, which files are to be downloaded.
Hope that is clear.
Enjoy!"
,tuidayhaha,2008-08-14T07:54Z,Thanks funnyguy1234 for your helpful instructions. It works.
