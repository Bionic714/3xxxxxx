If the reason for producing the 'Lovers' Guide" series is to educate, then 'The Lovers' Guide To Sexual Positions' definitely succeeds. What makes this DVD different from any book on the subject is that the viewer benefits from seeing real 'live' couples demonstrating the various positions and techniques. Despite the unavoidable explicitness of the visual lessons, you really do learn from observing how small, subtle changes in position, e.g. raising legs a few inches or slightly altering an angle can heighten sensations for one or both of you. This information would usually become lost in the text or still pictures of a book.

If I'm honest, I did find it at times slightly uncomfortable viewing - my reserved Englishness coming out, I guess. That said, it's presented as tastefully and respectfully as filming other couples having sex can be! It is both brave and groundbreaking. It's also undeniably erotic, although to linger on this would miss the point. One can only applaud the braveness of the couples who were prepared to be filmed making love with camera and crew in close proximity.
