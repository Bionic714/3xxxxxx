,adywan,2005-08-01T21:57Z,"This isn't true 5.1 and It's not off a DTS disk. This guy has stolen MY audio from my ADYWAN XVID release and claiming it to be his own. Nice try mate but i put a few things in the audio that wouldn't be on the english true soundtrack and , guess what... you made the mistake of upping a sample that had one of the bits on it. I put a lot of hard work into creating the audio my release and it really pisses me off when assholes like you claim that it's your work. Well you've been caught out mate."
,spadeko,2005-08-02T00:36Z,Please Upload it Tonight... i really Want it..
,wmadoss,2005-08-02T09:36Z,"I have heard the sound in your release adywan and this one has far better audio.
So either he improved your audio quite a bit or it isnt the same source."
,wmadoss,2005-08-02T13:16Z,"But for the record it isnt TRUE 5.1 surround, its pseudo 5.1 like adywan is saying."
,adywan,2005-08-02T17:54Z,"wmadoss I can guarantee that the only difference between MY audio and this one is that it's been made pseudo 5.1. I've downloaded the full release of this and he hasn't made ANY improvements at all. I wouldn't have made the accusation unless I knew 100% that it's my audio. If it's supposed to be off a DTS disc then why isn't it TRUE 5.1 then and have exactly the same audio marks that I added into mine? I unpacked the audio from both mine and this and put them side by side and they are the same, with this release having a 3% difference in volume."
,mike.roz,2005-08-02T19:02Z,"no offense but who care. adywan, your release was great as I downloaded it first. This is just a newer release that is better quality. It may have been taken from your copy but why are you complainin about it like he stle it from you? What do you think every1 is doing by downloading from this site?"
,wmadoss,2005-08-02T22:05Z,"Fair enough adywan.
I know and u know that this isnt from a REAL DTS track, so lets leave it to that.
5.1, sure it has sounds from all speakers but not the way its supposed to be..."
,DemonWarez,2005-08-06T01:52Z,and if u must no the disk was from the cinema up the road so get ya facts straight ya bender
,DemonWarez,2005-08-06T01:57Z,and i no tht bcus i also av stealth 5.1 so shut ur fuckin trap N00b
,DemonWarez,2005-08-06T01:57Z,LMAO Adywan shutup ya loser ur telecine was pure wank! and this is from a true DTS disk so i dnt no wat ur on abt
,wmadoss,2005-08-06T11:45Z,Sorry demonwarez but this is not from a real DTS track unless u really srewed up when u did the audio.
,DemonWarez,2005-08-07T01:42Z,Well i think i messed the audio up bcus it was my first release so i do apologize and yeh its cd wiv a audio track onit
,adywan,2005-08-07T10:11Z,"God, you're such a fucking kid DemonWarez. Dts2 disks have NOT been cracked and if you had somehow managed to crack it then why the psuedo 5.1 then. And answer me this then: if yours is from a true English DTS disk then why Does the fireman speak a line of Russian when the one fireman slips? Because I left that line in deliberately. And I'm not a fuckin Noob because i've been in the scene for years, just not under the name Adywan, so i know what i'm talking about. You also said that you messed the audio up because its your first release, then who's the REAL noob?Calling my telecine pure wank just shows what childish twat you really are. Not once have i trashed the quality of your release because, unlike some, you got off your ass and created a release for everyone.
Now that newer movies are going to be harder to get good quality, those of us who have the knowledge to make these releases should stop all the bickering and club together. One release may have great video but crap audio and another one vice versa, then along comes someone who has the knowledge to put them together and improve the release, but remember to credit all the people who have done the work. If someone gave you the audio disc then I can understand that you may have been duped without knowing it."
