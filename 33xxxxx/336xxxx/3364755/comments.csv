http://www.xtel.com.ua/nokia.php

I know... It´s a Russian site but it´s still pretty easy to navigate and it got screenshots for most of the games. Klick on JAVA under the serial 40 column and you can go from there."

This way I can test Java games and applications before I send it to my phone.

I am tire to send so many shit to my phone to test it. This is very useful for me.

Thank you.

Of course, I will seed this torrent for a long time."
