,Alejandroe84,2009-01-05T16:51Z,"hey there, I had received this message, on a new web page right after I had clicked ""download this torrent"" saying ""Error 503 Service Unavailable""... and then some more nonsense about Guru, or something like that. I was wondering, if it is something to do with a bug on my cpu, or something irrelevant to my own computer...any help would be great!"
,Alejandroe84,2009-01-12T17:25Z,"... I seem to have another problem now...

It seems to NOT read or HAVE .ifo files. I had completed the download, and when using dvdshrink, it could NOT locate or ""failed to open ********************.ifo, the system could not find the file specified""

I was wondering, is there any way to bypass this .ifo, and proceed to burn either dvdshrink, or any other programs out there? 

I wouldn't mind wanting to burn as an dvd."
,z_Ghost,2009-04-20T20:21Z,Sure is just open it with DVDshrink using the 'open folder' and burn it via there. Though the ifo files are there and there is nothing wrong with them so I would say its your computer or program your using.
