,jfmitch,2006-08-14T21:51Z,"When this torrent reaches 97.3% or 74.48MB it is complete although it will stay in the my torrents section of Azureus as incomplete.

,jfmitch,2006-08-14T21:56Z,"I screwed up sorry.  The serial number is available but the exe file is incomplete at 97.39%.  Still waiting for a seed.

,jfmitch,2006-08-15T21:18Z,"There are 8 of us in the waiting row all stuck at 97%.  A re-seed of an hour should get us all done.
