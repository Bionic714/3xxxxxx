,finduzz,2005-07-31T17:02Z,"bojo15: seeding means that you just keep you computer on, and uploading to all the others who's downloading from you. :)"
,bojo15,2005-07-31T18:59Z,"OK thanks,  thats what I figured,but instead of being a leech what are other people uploading from me while I'm downloading from them ?"
,bojo15,2005-07-31T20:22Z,"Jamima69, I'll have to read it, but it said it's gonna take 33 hrs. to d/l. Opps,now its up to 43 whats up with that."

,babb_z,2005-08-01T18:18Z,"epsxe = playstation emulator , these are PSP games !

macke, put the files from the folders into the exact same folders on your mem stick-thats it.
YOU MUST HAVE FIRMWARE 1.50."

,IHateTheSun,2005-08-04T01:44Z,Where do you get a PSP before UK launch date?
,veddoo,2005-08-05T01:29Z,"babb_z yo, I wonder if you can upload the upcoming games comatible with the PSP updte 2.0, the games worked fine with the org. system, but after the update it didn't, i've uploaded the update on piratebay so it would be very nice if u made it work although the update is comig soon to europe too. Tnx Veddoo"
,babb_z,2005-08-07T18:48Z,"To hide corrupt icons you need seipsp tool. Homebrew and Loaders etc WILL NOT work with firmware 2.00, 1.00 and 1.50 only. If your planning on upgrading to 2.00 for the web browser, in my opinion, dont do it. 2.00 is a long way off being cracked.............if ever."
,babb_z,2005-08-08T12:42Z,"Coded Arms, put COA_GAME in ROOT, put CODEDARMS_MS_ANYUMD and % in PSP/GAME.

Wipeout, put PSP_GAME and PRX in ROOT, put WOP_GAME and % in PSP/GAME.

Only works on 1.50 firmware."
,jaylivenyc,2005-08-08T13:07Z,"i am new to torrents, as a matter of fact this will be my first download!

what is the best torrent client to use? i already downloaded bitlord fron this site, and i have abc.  i have also heard about azureus.  

does anyone have a reccomendation?"
,W.w.j.D,2005-08-08T23:36Z,I my opinion Azureus is the best. :)
,W.w.j.D,2005-08-08T23:36Z,In*
,Rallerdaller,2005-08-09T22:11Z,Do they work with both US and JAP version?
,finduzz,2005-08-12T16:40Z,"The games that needs an UMD, do they work with the Ridge Racers UMD? And is it possbible to get Wipeout to work somehow??"
,jeffk,2005-08-13T22:56Z,"just insert any UMD, including a movie. I found
the wipeout in PSP_1GB_xxx.part2.rar works fine."
,punisher2006,2005-08-14T06:44Z,thanks for the upload but i have a problem. I followed the steps but when i try to start the game it says the game cant start. am i missing something

,MorbidGod,2005-08-14T22:57Z,cant get this mafakin hook boot to work.. can anyone give me a guide? thanks
,babb_z,2005-08-14T23:07Z,"1.52 firmware no good. Only works with 1.50 or 1.00. Wipout pure put PSP_GAME and PRX in ROOT and WOP_GAME in PSP/GAME. If it wont work, try making a new folder called common and put it in ROOT, then put PRX in that, should work. I have no probs, also UMD's are not required with these loaders, if not working without UMD, try a new loader from : http://hroo772.hopto.org:8181/psp-launchers/"
,punisher2006,2005-08-15T04:37Z,Thanks one other question how do i obtain firmware 1.50 or 1.00
,Rallerdaller,2005-08-15T18:36Z,"Ive tryed both with PRX in root and in common, none of them goes further than ""hold onto your hats..""

I havent got any of the other games to work yet either :/"
,Octogoogles,2005-08-15T23:43Z,"I understand what you guys are saying about what folders go where, but I guess I am missunderstanding what the general folder structure should look like. Looking at my psp I have to folders. One called PSP and one called MSD_root. Is this wrong? I can't get any games to work!?!"
,punisher2006,2005-08-16T15:17Z,Thanks! one other question how do i obtain firmware 1.50 or 1.00 
,Warhead56,2005-08-18T02:37Z,"How come it stops at 99.8 ? Please help. SOme other guy needed help too about this. Theres 12 seeders and everything, and it says its download at 33 kbs but its stuck at 99.8. How do I stop it and juust get what it download up to now, instead of waiting for it to finsh?"
,Zasad,2005-08-18T08:10Z,"to punisher2006
sorry to tell you this, but at this moment, there is no way to downgrade your firmware back to 1.5 you will have to wait for the 1.51, 1.52 and 2.0 to be cracked in some way"
,Izomatic,2006-01-13T18:48Z,"Yes, there is a way to downgrade. First update too version 2.0 then via e corrupt png/image u downgrade to 1.5... Google and you shall find!"
,Neroangle,2006-02-10T06:53Z,"umm, i'm guessing it won't work on 2.6 right, becuase i was just wondering howdoes this work, it turns all coroupt "
,fredstian,2006-03-04T13:00Z,"I finally got my hands on the 18 psp games + loaders. But I can't figure how to run the games!

Duz any body know a good iso download site??? please some 1 help me!!!! from daryl ttthhhaaannnkkksss!!!!"
,mips,2006-03-23T10:32Z,Why cant you people make a torrent where EACH game is on its own rar file. We can then use Azeureus to donwload ONLY the game we want. I have downloaded the torrent with 35 games. So now i have to download the whole 2.54 gig to get 1 game from your torrent working. You dont even have a list of the games here.

,HeyBeerman,2007-04-06T04:25Z,"will this work with 3.03OE-c ?  feeling dumb, upgraded the psp, but not sure how to use these ... as opposed to iso or cso."
,mak2204,2007-04-17T23:47Z,"How to play these games in firmwear 3.03 OE-C

All these games have afew folders

Folder 1 (PUZZLBBL) which sets on the route of memory stick, basically sets next to the PSP folder, with in this folder are the following:
1.	SYSDIR (Folder)
2.	USDIR   (Folder)
3.	ICONO
4.	PARMA.SFO
5.	PICO
6.	PICI

In the PSP/GAME150 folders are:

PUZZBOBB%
PUZZBOBB

And then there are all the files which are meant to go in the SAVEDATA folder

The problem I am having is that when I go to the game option and play the game, I can see the games, they even load up to the bit when it tries to start the launcher, at this point it just switches the psp off. I believe the games will work in Firmwear 1.50 versions.

All the games show up and will almost load but, when they initiate the launcher, the PSP switches off.

Firstly I hope I made sense, & secondly I hope u can help me get the games load.

Please help.

Thanks "
