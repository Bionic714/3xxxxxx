,shady78,2005-07-28T05:56Z,hey i was just wondering if this is workin for everybody it was highly requested i just wanna make sure its workin
,Samuli^,2005-07-28T13:10Z,I get disc dirty or damaged erros with this one as well as with the copy I burned from original myself. 
,Samuli^,2005-07-28T13:15Z,".. And I doubt it's just bad burn as I tried burning the original twice and this one once. This is the only xbox game I've ever had any problems with. 

PS. Thanks for the Ninja Gaiden Shady"

,shady78,2005-08-02T20:47Z,yup go into your evox settings and change game reighn to whatever you perfer i set mine on auto to detect wether its  pal or ntsc 
,H3x4g0n,2005-08-13T19:35Z,"Anyone know how to change to NTSC without evox. I cant make that dash work... and booting with the evox-dvd I can shange to ntsc but it wont last... when I look at the settings its back to ""defult""
PANIC!"
,Nwambe,2005-08-17T21:37Z,"Okay, so I downloaded the ISO and tried to burn it in Nero and DVDDecrypter, both of which result in my XBox saying ""Your disc is dirty or damaged"".

Am I doing something wrong here, or is the ISO not working for other people, too?"
,peronthious,2006-01-06T01:50Z,"Do you have a modded XBOX?  Without a modded XBOX, the disc will not work."
,el.dia,2006-02-18T23:56Z,"is this the whole game? since it's 2,75 gb?"
,dan_plus_o,2006-03-20T06:14Z,"read the description! It says that the xbox live files have been removed, but that doesn't matter because you can't play on XBL with the mod chip on."
,g-drag,2006-03-21T10:10Z,thx for the game
,g-drag,2006-03-21T17:58Z,only 0.1% to go. BitTorrent have a problem with connecting...

,lx underoath xl,2006-06-24T20:12Z,"Come on, someone seed!"
,jimmiejimmiejimmie,2006-11-14T18:37Z,"please seed:/  downloading 1,4 kb :( please seed"
,Jesusv06,2006-11-22T07:27Z,hmm how do you get it to work?? i burned the game with dvd decrypter like i always burn games. I burned two copies one at 2x speed and at 4x speed. none of those worked. the 4x speed just doesnt load and the 2x speed one loads the microsoft intro and then goes to a loading screen that goes up to 61% but then gives me a dirty disk error. im using an softmod and runnin evox with auto detect region settings and nothin. but my xbox is NTSC just like the one from the torrent so i dont think the region matters. what do u use to burn it so it works?  i was going to use nero but it asked for two DVDs so i dont know? what are you guys using to burn it so it runs??  thanx for your time!
,23Kenn,2006-11-28T23:31Z,"is this even working because i always get the ""Your disc is dirty or damaged"" "
