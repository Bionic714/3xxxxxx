          MOVIE INFO: Continuing in the tradition of his hits THE WATERBOY and
                      HAPPY GILMORE, Adam Sandler stars in LITTLE NICKY, a
                      supernatural comedy about Satan's geekiest son. Nicky
                      (Sandler) is relieved when his father (Harvey Keitel)
                      decides to continue as ruler of the underworld for
                      another 10,000 years instead of picking one of his
                      bullying brothers, Adrian (Rhys Ifans) or Cassius
                      (Tom "Tiny" Lister), to reign. Adrian and Cassius,
                      hungry for power, decide to travel to New York City
                      in order to spread Hell on Earth. Only Nicky can stop
                      them and save his father--and the world--from his
                      brothers' evil schemes. But Nicky has no idea what to
                      expect from New York City, and he has to deal with new
                      activities such as eating, sleeping, and meeting a new
                      girlfriend, Valerie (Patricia Arquette). His friends
                      Mr. Beefy, a talking bulldog, and John and Peter,
                      a pair of hardcore heavy metal fans, try to help Nicky
                      stand up for himself and eventually save the universe.
                      LITTLE NICKY features a cast of regulars from other
                      Adam Sandler movies, plus a hilariously bizarre sense
                      of humor that allows all sorts of odd and twisted
                      things to happen.
