[T],L_Hammond,2005-07-28T17:52Z,"KilJaden: Thanks for sharing! The application works fine, and I'm pretty sure this will be a popular torrent. The Instant Lookup feature is very neat: just double click on a word and it is looked up in the dictionary, and then listen to the pronunciation! (just wish the floating window could ""auto hide"" but one cannot get everything). Anyway, a very nice and useful application/torrent! Thanks again."
[T],L_Hammond,2005-07-28T19:21Z,"KilJaden: The tracker is working. But the stats are for now switched off during ""peak hours"" because of the heavy load."
