  Are you ready for the ultimate battle on snow?

  You'll get proximity missiles, atomic snowballs, and snow bombs to
  use against your opponents as you battle your way to the finish line.
  If that doesn't do the trick, you've always got your fists for those
  up close and personal encounters. 

  * Throttle the competition with hard-core hand-to-hand combat and
    weapons like Proximity Missiles, Snow Bombs and the Atomic Snowball.

  * Race with hyper-realistic velocity giving new meaning to the words
    "breakneck speed."

  * Compete as one of 19 different characters on 19 different sleds.

  * Get major air and perform over 60 cool tricks! Each character has
    unique moves.  Gain points and upgrade your sled.

  * Master 12 Outlandish Winter Tracks that will assault your senses
    from the Swiss Alps to The Lost City of Atlantis.

  * Fight head-to-head with 2-4 friends in one of 5 open Battle Arenas.

  * Upgrade Shop: Acquire points and upgrade your sled by increasing
    the snowmobile's power, and the number, strength and accuracy of
    power-ups.

  * Six Different Modes: Race, Points, Battle Arena, Upgrade Shop,
    Training and Arcade.


  We tested this game on a developer XBOX, and it works.  Since there is
  no mod chip yet, we have no idea if this release will work on retail
  XBOXes when/if a mod comes out.  However, now that there is a release,
  a modchip developer will be inclined to get our releases to work, so
  we think a future mod will work with this release.

  If a game is small enough to be burned to a CD, you can burn it to 
  either a CD or DVD, at your option, using the same ISO file.  
  The Xbox does not use media checks like the PS2. 

  When burning to a CD, if your CD burning program has an option, 
  choose "MODE1/2048", exactly as if you were burning a PC CD-ROM.
  We recommend PrimoDVD for burning Xbox for both CD and DVD, but 
  all CD writing software besides Clone CD should work fine.

  From our experience, the retail Xbox can only read DVD-RW's
  and CD-RW's, so if you want to be sure that these will work
  with a future mod, we recommend burning them to Rewritable
  discs. We have heard reports of the retail Xbox reading some
  types of DVD-R discs, but we have been unable to verify this.
