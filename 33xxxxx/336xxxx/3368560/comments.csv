,Shylock,2005-08-12T13:46Z,"why is it a better version? i'm nabbing it from : http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3368351 doesnt make sense to have a bunch of torrent going does it? and no one has said that version has any problems, but hy do you say this one isnt as good. it is slightly larger."
,Sh4d0w,2005-08-13T09:36Z,"this isnt

,Niedemeyer,2005-08-13T16:22Z,"I couldnt get that version to work, Norton. There were troubles during the installation with cd 2 and 3 concerning voices in the game. So I`m going to give this one a go."

,Brian Decker,2007-02-01T10:48Z,can some 1 please seed the original dungeon siege 4 me. Stuck at 82.7. thanx. Along with 15 other people. I want to play the first 1 b4 i play part 2. thanx again.
,blackcurtain,2007-09-26T08:20Z,"neolitefight...your an idiot, why would anyone down a torrent that you didn't already know what it was about, you could have downed the game demo in minutes to find you don't like it.

Brian Decker...go buy the damn thing, the first DS and LOA are only 20 fucking dollars. cheap bastard.

for the next Noob to ask...you don't ""unrar"" .bin files, they are similar to an ISO, it's an image file, use power iso to burn to disk, or see if (not sure but should be) bin's are mountable on virtual drive with power iso or deamon tools.

,radek1990,2008-12-02T20:13Z,thanks great game:D but i cant play online with gamespy :D it says invalid cd code or something like tht:D dont rmember anyone knows how to fix it?
,isisx3,2009-06-08T18:47Z,since it's a clone i'm pretty sure you can't play online..
,BlarghenFlarghen,2009-07-16T01:47Z,"I DL'ed this and the instructions. ""Unrar, mount, etc..."" but there's nothing to unrar. Nothing to mount. Just 4 folders with 1 bin and 1 cue file each.

I spent several days downloading this and it's bogus."
,BlarghenFlarghen,2009-07-16T01:48Z,Disregard my last comment. I just noticed I have to mount the cue files. My bad.
,isisx3,2009-08-17T13:49Z,"This game is in English.

For those of you who don't know how to install I'll try to give you simple explanations. 

You need a program like Daemon Tools, Daemon Tools Lite is free.

You can download Daemon Tools Lite here..
http://download.cnet.com/Daemon-Tools-Lite/3000-2646_4-10778842.html


Install Daemon tools light, it'll ask you to restart your computer, do so.

When you boot back up the system try icon will be by your clock down at the bottom right hand corner of your computer screen (unless you've moved your start menu bar.)

The Icon looks like a purple lighting ray inside a silver circle.

Right click on the system tray icon,
high light ""virtual cd/dvd room"" with your mouse
and when that window opens up highlight 
""device 0""
Then click on ""mount image""
That will open up a browser window, go to the folder that you downloaded (dungeon Siege 2 [4 CDs]...)
Click on the first folder labeled Dungeon Siege 2 CD 1
And click on the file that shows up.

It will then pop up a window as if you had just inserted a CD, and pronto. Click Run Setup. 

If a window does not pop up, go to my computer, and then click on the new drive that is in there.


During the set up you will be asked to mount cds 2, 3 and 4. You do this the same way you mounted the first CD. You do not need to keep all of them mounted. Just simply go to the same device where CD1 is mounted and click Mount image and select the CD2 folder, and then 3 and 4.


Good Luck :)



And thanks for the torrent, it was fast and has an easy set up. One of the best game torrents I've downloaded. "
,isisx3,2009-08-17T14:09Z,"Okay, I don't really get this... 

""copy over the cracked content located in the /crack directory on CD1 to your installation directory""

I don't have anything in my CD1 folder besides the .bin and .cue files. The only things I have are 4 .bin and 4 .cue files and the install.txt file... 

The game works fine though.

Is anyone else missing a /crack folder?"
,isisx3,2009-08-23T13:11Z,"Okay, I figured it out, unfortunately now I have to start all over. For those of you having the problem I had of not finding the /crack folder, let me explain to you.



Mount CD 1,
Go to ""my computer"",
RIGHT Click the mounted DS CD1 Drive,
Click Explore, 
Open the Crack Folder,
Copy the dungeonsiege2.exe file,

Go to the folder where you installed Dungeon Siege,

On my computer it automatically set to ""Drive C>Program Files>Microsoft Games>Dungeon Siege 2""

Paste the file into the Dungeon Siege 2 Folder.

It'll ask if you want to ""copy and replace"" or ""keep both copies""

Choose Copy and Replace

Always open your dungeon siege through that file.


-- Unfortunately I didn't find this sooner, now I have to start all over. Greaaat. "
