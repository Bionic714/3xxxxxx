,stoner_rick,2005-08-15T02:16Z,"brilliant little program, 11/10 :)"
,looneyk,2005-08-15T19:21Z,"well 5 ppl say its ok, and ive been using it for 2 years now without a problem, maybe ur virus came from something else or ur a complete idiot !!!!"
,ahmedrami,2005-08-15T23:31Z,"I dont think that MrSly is an complete idiot.
He only uses an virusprogram that tells him there is an infected file called CrackSearcher.exe
 It is an harmless warning.
And please dont call folks for things on pb.
We are gentlemen here. I have been using the program for some years too. F-prot, Kaspersky and someone more calls it for virus. 
Harmless for your computer i think.
It is an very good prog."
,looneyk,2005-08-16T15:17Z,"ya, but he makes it look like i'm upping viruses, which i would never dream of doing.

he should be certain of his comments before he posts them. he should also get proper antivirus, so dont go defending his idiocy just yet, eh!"
,ahmedrami,2005-08-17T00:32Z,He is only telling that his proper antivirus tells him. Not an idiot maybe lamer or s책 but not an idiot. hehe
,looneyk,2005-08-17T04:37Z,"well, i agree with u there, but im not a virus spreader"

,scruffsshop,2011-08-05T06:41Z,it is not infected with a hack tool. it is a hack tool. that is why you are trying to download it. to crack a program
