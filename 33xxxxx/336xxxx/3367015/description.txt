  By harnessing the destructive power of the Four Elements, Dr. Neo
  Cortex creates Crunch, a Super-Bandicoot with one mission...demolish
  all that lies before him. Will Crash and Coco be up to the challenge?
  You can bet your bandicoot they will! 

  * The biggest adventure ever: 30 new action-filled levels in
    jam-packed environments. 

  * Multiple modes of vehicular mayhem: Control 8 different vehicles -
    from a Crash Glider to a giant robot suit. 

  * You go girl: For the first time, Crash's tough-as-nails sister,
    Coco, is fully playable. 

  * Positively eyeball popping: The most dazzling special effects ever
    seen in a Crash game. 


  We tested this game on a developer XBOX, and it works.  Since there is
  no mod chip yet, we have no idea if this release will work on retail
  XBOXes when/if a mod comes out.  However, now that there is a release,
  a modchip developer will be inclined to get our releases to work, so
  we think a future mod will work with this release.

  If a game is small enough to be burned to a CD, you can burn it to 
  either a CD or DVD, at your option, using the same ISO file.  
  The Xbox does not use media checks like the PS2. 

  When burning to a CD, if your CD burning program has an option, 
  choose "MODE1/2048", exactly as if you were burning a PC CD-ROM.
  We recommend PrimoDVD for burning Xbox for both CD and DVD, but 
  all CD writing software besides Clone CD should work fine.

  From our experience, the retail Xbox can only read DVD-RW's
  and CD-RW's, so if you want to be sure that these will work
  with a future mod, we recommend burning them to Rewritable
  discs. We have heard reports of the retail Xbox reading some
  types of DVD-R discs, but we have been unable to verify this.
