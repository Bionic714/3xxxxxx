,HoochieMamma,2005-07-30T09:42Z,@minstryofsnd: Seed it. No one has a copy yet. I can only see everyone at 10%
,matseklov,2005-07-30T12:50Z,Tack / thx
,dbat,2005-07-30T13:07Z,As I dont use torrent for tv eps and I get them quite fast I thought to help out PB by seeding the file with same torrent thats already out here. Dosent seem to work though as I cant connect the tracker. Could help out with rest of other popular series and eps if it can bee done like this.
,schmigs,2005-07-30T22:19Z,is anyone else finding this an incredably slow torrent? im only gettin speeds of 3 or 4 kb/s.
,PidGin128,2005-08-03T04:11Z,"thats an absolutely lovely description you wrote up / pasted . would you mind throwing it in an nfo for future rls or if the video already has and nfo leave it hanging around. but regardless , i must thank you for your excellent contribution to my library. and yeah--  i second that super seed mode, its has its uses but not in a healthy / thriving swarm."
,cotkubt,2005-08-13T11:39Z,Thank you for my Atlantis fix! :-D
