,franki,2006-01-06T00:49Z,"Heads Up people. Here is the solution to make it work. How i did it. 1. Make dvd with nero burn as an image. 2. Mount the image 3. Open dvd decryptor. If you dont have it here`s a download link ""http://fileforum.betanews.com/detail/1011845169/1"" 4. File - Decrypt and answer Yes To ALL 5. Burn the new files (make new dvd) with nero and whola:) Thats it."
