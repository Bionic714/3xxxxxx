Old cartoon from the 80's featuring a mischevious cat that never knows when to quit. IMDB link at the top for more info.

This includes 5 episodes 4 of them are actual Heathcliff episodes and one of them is an episode featuring Heathcliff's rival Riff-Raff I couldn't find anymore eps with Riff-Raff, I wish there could have been more. And also one episode is from when the series first came out.

As always check out Nostalgia Tracker old cartoons and more.
