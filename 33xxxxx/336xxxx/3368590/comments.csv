,Napoje,2008-06-20T17:44Z,"One very anoying thing with this torrent, every song is sorted by ""Grand theft Auto"" as artists, instead of the real artists name."
,mr_inc0gnit0,2008-07-07T02:25Z,"Does not have ""VCPR""!

,jack_in_the_box,2008-09-12T21:25Z,"128kbit is just fine...a higher bit rate would just make the torrent bigger and will take longer to download...most people can't hear the difference...128kbit is CD quality...  

thanks for upload ;D "
,North Nitro,2008-09-14T10:27Z,"The torrent is otherwise good, but for some reason, all the tracks have ""Grand Theft Auto"" as artists?"
,papoj1,2008-10-02T15:07Z,i think this is probably teh most complete COMPLETE collection of GTA VC soundtracks i've seen on torrent cuz teh ones i see were missin a few fo some reasons
,papoj1,2008-10-02T15:08Z,"it's rly hard to tell wat is missin...i mean, idk y ppl upload these and they r missin stuff"
,Elgaard,2008-10-02T21:50Z,"Thanks for helping me keeping this torrent alive for so long. :)

For everyone who says tracks are missing: Yes, but this is a rip of the retail soundtrack, released on CDs. The missing tracks are also missing from there. ;)"
,mikeru,2008-10-31T02:48Z,"your biggest mistake..... BEING BORN!!!

,I_spy001,2009-04-21T12:07Z,"- even if its a few tracks missing, you sure came through with all of these songs. thanks so much"
,MannYboi,2009-05-20T22:47Z,"Hahhaa, i was just playing Vice City and heard ""Your Love"" on the radio... Had to download it, and then i found this torrent... GREAT, thanks!"

,Quebedify,2011-10-30T02:50Z,"man, i can't thank you enough for this.

i love vice city. i love the pastel colours, the 80s florida setting, but most of all, i love the soundtrack. full of variety and cheesy 80s tunes. i've always wanted the entire collection.

and baby, you got the entire soundtrack right here for me to download. right here.


i love you. "
,SOHH,2012-06-10T16:56Z,"Been searching for this for a while, during that time I've had to preserve my 5 plays of each song on Spotify! This will definitely be going in the car! Love it, thanks a lot for uploading!"
