,metallica_1992,2007-11-01T15:37Z,Could any motherfucker help me. Everything works fine until it´s loading the match and then the fucking game quits and i´m out of the game. By the way. You who needs help with the install. You don´t need to install the fucking game. It´s just to pack up the rar.-files and then you move the crack into that map and you can start the game. But you don´t need to install.

---------------------------------
I. Someone who said ""I always get the message it's not installed correctly when I want to run the exe""
Solution : 1.run ""setupreg.exe""
               2.run ""3Dsetup.exe"" in the ""3DSetup"" folder in the installation directory
               3.select either ""software renderer"" or the other option , and any resolution - and click ""OK""
               4. NOW run the exe

II. Someone who said ""Everything works fine until it´s loading the match and then the fucking game quits and i´m out of the game.""

I had the same prob , then I did this

            1. Run the game, then go to ""Options"" /""Audio Options"" , select ""Commentary"" , and put all volume levels to Off - you can raise the volume again after the game starts.
            2. Try starting a match - if it crashes the game, go to ""3dSetup.exe"" as described in the previous problem, and change any one of the settings, and run the game again - if after trying all the combinations of the settings (Software Renderer/graphics card, Resolution changing, Triple Buffers) the game doesn't work...
Atleast it was just 100MB, and not 450 - like FIFA 200) is - btw , that runs perfectly - look for the torrent if u want it."
,wolverineo,2008-01-17T15:06Z,"I meant FIFA2000 - good torrent, lots of seeds, and f#in good game."
,GHROCKS,2008-02-15T18:15Z,"PLZ! Seed, i want this game, I have played sense it came out, and now have my CD given up!! =( PLZ, SEED..... I will seed back for a week or 2!"
,GHROCKS,2008-02-15T19:11Z,"Thank U very much for the upload, BUT... its says: ""the file is either an unkown file or damaged"", when I tries to unrar the ""fifa2001"" file and the ""crack"" file!
What should I do??"
,kingsquita,2008-10-07T01:00Z,"this game is shit it don't work, its a waste of time"
