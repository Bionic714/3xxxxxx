In February 2004, during the Super Bowl half-time show, Janet Jackson suffered a "wardrobe malfunction" - her right breast and nipple were exposed for a split second. Millions of American television viewers could not believe their eyes. They were outraged at this indecent event and CBS, which broadcast the Super Bowl, was slapped with a $500,000 fine for showing Janet Jackson's nipple. A few weeks later famous talk radio hosts Howard Stern and Buba the Love Sponge were censored, then pushed off the airwaves for their provocative sex-laced banter. This program examines the world of America's new puritans, unveiling their methods of influencing both the ultraconservative Republican government and the supposedly more tolerant Democratic opposition. It also looks at the consequences of their growing power.
