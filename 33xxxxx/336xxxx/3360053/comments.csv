,mGoLos,2005-07-23T18:44Z,Thank you
,Bongborg,2005-07-23T21:37Z,"Thanks for the rant, it told me ever so much about the show and the torrent. BTW, Native Americans have had the vote since passage of the Citizenship Act 80 years ago, you ill-informed lout."
,boncuklar,2005-07-23T21:57Z,"Yeah right Bongborg, that's the *official* story, coz that looks so nice on the papers you brainless moron. Ever been to any of these reservation camps or just repeating like a zombie what they want you to repeat? Just shut the fuck up if you want to stay an ignorant fool. If there was a rant, it was becoz I liked the torrent. Thnx for the share damo123! I hope I will get it soon. I guess some of us are looking forward to a world that is a bit more just and not ruled by morons like Bush and friends. And there's nothing wrong to show your emotions about this kind of thing, otherwise these people will keep thinking they own the world. Brainless shitheads."
,damo123,2005-07-24T02:28Z,"Hope you like it guys, I did. For someone living outside the USA I had forgotten how prudish people used to be. The thing that made me laugh was Bono's acceptance speech in which he said ""fucking fantastic"". Then there was this discussion with some commentator about the use of the ""f-word"", after a few of these  the interviewer said something like, 'you can say ""fuck"" here, this is foreign TV'. Enjoy!"
,Bongborg,2005-07-24T05:51Z,"Hey, bonkulo, I do happen to live in the USA, oppose Bush and we aren't all responsible for what he has done. That being said, maybe you are the one who needs to shut the fuck up, since you are probably not in a position to do anything about it, and you come across as an idiot and are unlikely to  help anyone understand the real problem. Have a nice stroke."
,Bongborg,2005-07-24T05:54Z,"P.S. Hey, dickhead, I am one-eighth Creek Native American."
,crosone,2005-07-24T11:12Z,P.S. I'm 1/16th minority-that-gives-me-precedence-to-say-whatever-don't-tread-on-me.  So there!
,odb888,2005-07-24T16:31Z,"Looks like this one going to be interesting, downloading right now. I never understood the idea behind outlawing the use of words like fuck in media, people us it everyday, it just makes it more spectacular, undermines its own goal. Here in sweden theres also been a radical change when it comes to nudity in media the last 20 years. But not as bad as in america, sitting outside looking in on US it feels like a land of extremes."
,boncuklar,2005-07-24T16:56Z,"Well bongo-bongo, being 1/8 native american certainly doesn't make you an expert on the subject, obvious enough for people who know more about this and who have visited many native american camps. I wonder where the other 7/8 come from, hmm? Inbreed fucked-up white american shitheads? "
,boncuklar,2005-07-24T16:57Z,"Yep we enjoyed it a lot damo123, thnx a bunch. "
,Bongborg,2005-07-24T17:28Z,"We are so lucky we have you people on the outside that know more about everything than those of us on the inside. Please do come back to America sometime, bonk-culo, I'll show you the redneck reservation. Give you the grand tour behind the pickup truck, too."
,odb888,2005-07-25T01:08Z,"Holy peanuts, after watching the documentary i was a bit chocked. Laws that threaten to put teenagers in prison and sexual on offenders list for life for having concensual sex. 
It reminds of the absurd laws the taliban has, about women not aloud to show any skin at all, men must have beards, it based on the same stupid ignorant reasons. 
Redmags22, you may have the right to make porn and swear right now, but arent you afraid that in the near the future you cannot? that was what i was thinking about, were will it stop? sort of smelled police state the whole thing, outlawing clothing and so forth... im just amased."
,boncuklar,2005-07-25T02:38Z,"Oh wait, that was a mistake on my part: by pumping out your 'brains' and pumping shit back in you *would* get the better of it. Bwahahaha. You guys are hilarious. "
,Bongborg,2005-07-25T04:38Z," ""I did not study philosophy and politics for 8 years for nothing""... there's a matter of opinion. Anyone paying you to be a philospher now? Do you hold elected office? Or did you just mean you didn't study?"
,boncuklar,2005-07-25T05:25Z,"Surprise Bongborg: I *teach* philosophy. I'm an expert on the philosophy of Foucault, Derrida and especially Deleuze to name just a few. Never heard of those eh? Didn't think so. Well, you're welcome to try me again. Let me tell you though, I am using a fraction of my abilities when discussing with the likes of you and redballs. Don't think I'm impressed by the things you guys say for a second. Oh let me think ahead and guess with what you guys will come up next: anyone using my language, like shit and fucked and so on can only be a philosopher in Europe. Well, it is a tactics: using Gargantua and Pantagruelian language is the only way for dealing with dumb people like you. Oh wait, you guys probably never heard of Rabelais either. Oh well, I can better quote from your culture so you guys can understand me, so like Duke Nukem would say: eat shit and die!"
,Bongborg,2005-07-25T05:44Z,"Yes, you are surprising; I didn't think megalomaniacs could finish postgraduate work. Good to know someone as smart as you is working in such a useful, real-world field as Philosophy. If you were doing real work, someone would have to clean up your messes all the time."
,boncuklar,2005-07-25T17:53Z,"Oh and to finish that story: so when this one guy keeps saying: ""dudez, it's not about the tit, it's about Hitler being a dangerous guy, the whole world is in danger."" This other guy keeps repeating: ""Man are you obsessed with tits or what. I work there and there and there and I will analyse you and prove you're sick in your head."" Yeah right. Dream on. Like I said: you guys are a joke. "
,boncuklar,2005-07-25T22:54Z,"And plz, do not quote from a dictionary to prove your right, I contributed to *WRITING* two scientific dictionaries in the past. Psychology: a pseudo science making use of existing narratives. So it is a science based on hermeneutics. Hermeneutics is used by reactionary scientist to reproduce social and personal reality that is obsolete. Only by getting rid of the hermeneutic nature of psychology, we could get to a description of the human mind being part of a bigger, immanent reality. I have kept it as simple as possible. I do not believe btw that you have ever read ONE word by Deleuze. Succer."
,Bongborg,2005-07-25T23:12Z,"I assume you are wishing the nuke on America; how lucky we are you went into Philosophy instead of Nuclear Physics. One less lunatic around the bombs. I'd return the wish, in spades, but unlike yourself, I am not asshole enough to wish harm on all the innocent Europeans it would kill.  And BTW, I have vaguely heard of your philosophers and authors, and have tested at IQ 150 on the Stanford-Binet; keep believing you are smarter than everyone else you are dealing with, one day one of them will show everyone you are not. I only wish we could meet so I could repay you for your kindness in wishing us nuclear destruction with a permanent reminder of the sentiment on your face. My fist isn't as destructive as a nuke, but it usually works for loudmouthed shit-for-brains blowhards like you."
,redmags22,2005-07-25T23:17Z,"ahhhh... the voice of reason!
Hi there Bonborg, greetings from rainy Austria!
Have you been following the thread?  My students swear he's a 13 yr. old with a bad skin problem! 
Although I don't like to flaunt my scores I am a proud member of MENSA and I actually have read quite a bit of post modern philosophical works which is why I can say with absolute certainty that the child has not!
Can you actually imaging a university prof talking like that? I guess Mr Roth could start a whole new book! 
To be honest if I knew were he was I’d tell his Mom!"
,boncuklar,2005-07-25T23:21Z,"Yeah well, ok, I admit, I am a 8 year old. Now you're on me. Got you busy for long enough though didn't I? "
,boncuklar,2005-07-25T23:36Z,"""Can you actually imaging a university prof talking like that?"" You don't have much of an imagination do ya? Well, try to figure out this one: why would indeed a prof talk like this? Don't you feel the hatred? I HATE fucking losers who help this world to go to the smithereens. WE CARE dude, that's why we are full of hatred against fucked up reactionary people like you. How the hell can you defend american policy when you are living in Austria? A grandchild of Hitler I presume? "
,boncuklar,2005-07-25T23:48Z,"Oh, what am I saying, you would probably only be proud to be a grandchild of Hitler, the greatest loser of all times. And how is it that you are a proud member of MENSA and still don't understand the issue here, after I have repeated it 4 times? Still masturbating eh? Well, go on, some day you will squirt on your keyboard and your students will be able to follow it live from your webcam, as you losers do all the time I am certain."
,Bongborg,2005-07-25T23:57Z,"I think we have to revise that Guiness Book entry for ""greatest loser of all time"" now."
,redmags22,2005-07-26T00:05Z,Hitler had one thing going for him that you do not... charisma
,Bongborg,2005-07-26T00:11Z,"You know, I bet this is the longest comment page Pirate Bay has."
,redmags22,2005-07-26T00:14Z,"sad isn't it?
But seriously... my students didn't believe me, I brought in the doco to discuss - well it doesn't matter what - I told them about this kid and they had to log on just to see - this guy is an ASSIGNMENT!
We're working on xenophobia and the kid is textbook!
I owe it all to you!"
,boncuklar,2005-07-26T00:19Z,"Bwahaha, I really missed you are a female redbags. Now I understand what the bags stand for. "
,boncuklar,2005-07-26T01:20Z,"Indeed, I didn't have to know you are a female, I could have guessed. How many times did you repeat about your class and your students? Well, several times. Very feminine you know, to talk a lot, but never say anything that's to the point. And do you think that this gag has impressed me a bit? Think again. "
,redmags22,2005-07-26T18:35Z,"France/The Toubon Law:
Georgia Tech Lorraine operates a site on the World-Wide-Web (WWW) which is in English only, except for the directions to the campus, which are in French. Under French law Georgia Tech Lorraine can face fines of up to $4,300 (25,000 francs) for every time an English-only page is accessed. 
In 1996, the Academie Francaise, official guardian of the French language, announced a ban on the words ""hamburger,"" ""sandwich,"" and ""weekend.""  
Where was the hue and cry then?
Recently the word e-mail has been banned in France and its use results in a hefty fine. “e-mail” -""hamburger"" - ""sandwich"" - ""weekend"" – “fuck” – you decide! 
Once again for the reading-comprehension impaired: The FCC laws, as they stand, are only limited to the public airways. You may broadcast Janet Jackson’s breast on any and all private channels – you may use as many swear words as you like, broadcast any kind of porn including bestiality but excluding child pornography and kill any number of people on PAY TV the only difference is people CAN CHOOSE to subscribe and thus watch or choose not to subscribe and be spared! 

Here’s the deal – EVERY country has indecency laws. Really. Every country has age of consent laws, the only difference is – most Americans know about theirs. If you think the American laws are ridiculous watch the movie KIDS. If that boy had committed the same crimes with a weapon other than his penis he would be serving a life sentence. 
If you’d like to learn about your country’s laws check out this link:
http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/encyclopedia/a/ag/age_of_consent.htm
here – just a smattering
Netherlands it is a severe crime to have sex with a prostitute below 18, or any person below 16, anywhere in the world.
Algeria: 16; same sex relationships are illegal
Hong Kong: gay 21 (and both the older AND younger partners can be prosecuted and liable to imprisonment for life), lesbian unknown, heterosexual females 16, heterosexual males 18
France allows the prosecution of its own citizens on rape charges for sex with minors under 15 abroad even if it was legal with respect to the local jurisdiction. The same applies to Germany 
Saudi Arabia: heterosexual must be married, homosexual illegal
 heterosexual sex outside marriage is punishable by flogging
 male and female homosexual sex is illegal by virtue of being outside marriage
 homosexual sex is technically punishable by death"
,boncuklar,2005-07-26T21:22Z,"Oh no, I typed so fast, I missed the r twice in the word distribution and I forgot to mention the quote is on p. 37 of the book by Delanda. Bongborg and you redmags22, you have both stated several times that you are so smart, why don't you go order it from amazon.com, it is at this moment the most interesting and advanced combination of philosophy and science available. I am curious of what you might think of it."
,redmags22,2005-07-26T23:00Z,"I have NEVER once stated that I am ""so smart"" neither did bonborg. Being smart is not a prerequisite for ordering from Amazon, as your statement implies. Globalization and Culture - been there done that, interesting - but better books have been written on the topic since then.
And no offence intended but I would sooner take fashion advice from Stevie Wonder  than reading recommendations from you. Reading what you claim to have read doesn’t seem to have done you any good at all."
,boncuklar,2005-07-26T23:02Z,"And that, I tell you, was for real my final post. I am going to spend my time doing something more creative."
,redmags22,2005-07-26T23:19Z,"Frightened? Your rants are farcical. I’m not the least bit frightened, although I must admit the entertainment value is unfortunately wearing a little thin. 
There are laws which you choose to interpret as some huge government conspiracy – break the law pay the penalty –It’s really just that simple.
Every country has indecency laws – every country enforces them – but when a Frenchman makes a documentary about the laws in America, which by the way are not at all the strictest, you whip out your soapbox.
“And your other point about xenophobia and those laws you mention: in my opinion those examples are not examples of xenophobia” Excuse me but once again your fanaticism is blinding you to the written word. Those laws were, as I very clearly stated about “banning” things – nothing at all to do with Xenophobia. The others were about the age of the consent. I DO SO wish you’d read all the words before commenting. Additionally, I did not comment – but just stated the facts not factoids.
Perhaps you should take a moment and digest what you “read” (view) before commenting – it appears, as with the documentary itself, that you miss the most salient and self-evident points otherwise."
,boncuklar,2005-07-27T00:24Z,"Yeah well, whatever. I have given up. I think you have repeated in every post, yes in EVERY post your ideas about adult stuff on tv and the rules which apply to them. I have repeated in every post, YES IN EVERY POST my problem is not with those rules. How hard is that to understand for you? Do I have to spell it out for you? I endorse those rules too. Can't you understand my problem is with something else? I am getting more and more the feeling I am trying to reason with a debilitating person here. In what mental institution are you 'working' again? Are you sure you are not mental yourself? Sheesh. "
,boncuklar,2005-07-27T00:28Z,"But then, all those friendly things still do apply, you silly old lady."
,redmags22,2005-07-27T00:35Z,"""you silly old lady.""
try to find piccies for Miss Styria Fitness 1999... to be proven wrong once again! I'm the redhead."
,boncuklar,2005-07-27T00:49Z,"Well darn it, I did a google, but no pics.  Apparently we have very different newssources. The people reacted, than the politics reacted or does that not count, is the only thing that counts who reacted first? Second: I stated before, several times, that I saw this problem as part of a bigger problem, and stated my concern that this bigger problem *COULD BE* a danger for the world. Are you from another planet or something? I have read like several, I really mean several very serious, academic books on this subject, and people all over the world are concerned about this. INCLUDING SOME VERY PATRIOTTIC AMERICANS. It was mostly americans from whom I read reports on independent news sites. Do you think all of them could be wrong at once? Do you think I would rather believe you than all this numerous serious people who are capable of thinking critically, while you have proven several times you're not. Are you so stubborn or obstinate that you are not willing to admit, just a bit, that something, you know, very perhaps something could go wrong? Wouldn't it be better to be aware of it before it is too late. Again, the only answer to this is that you are a blinded fool who has a big sympathy for the right-wing policy of the US, inside the US and outside of it. But that is not going to convince me you know, it doesn't matter how many times you might repeat what you have repeated all the time. I'd rather stick with some facts than with blind ideology. 
"
,boncuklar,2005-07-27T00:53Z,"Btw, I suggest you do not give away so many facts about yourself. If I would be a wacko, I am very close to finding out where you live and who you are. Just a friendly reminder. You don't know whether I am doing all this 'ranting' as you call it, just to get to you for other reasons that have nothing to do with american politics or something like that. Not that I would care to find you or something, it's just a warning.  "
,boncuklar,2005-07-27T01:23Z,"Well ok, I told you I couldn't find them out of courtesy, honestly, I couldn't care about your pics so I didn't go do a google. Or do you really want me to do that? Is that what you're after, attention?"
,redmags22,2005-07-27T01:24Z,"""Btw, I suggest you do not give away so many facts about yourself""

hee, hee, hee! Sorry still giggling over that one!
Find the redhead in Europe! Who am I? Waldo?
Hee, hee, hee!
NOW, I understand your definition of the word ""fact""! 
Hee, hee, ha, ha! You really just can't make stuff like this up!"
,boncuklar,2005-07-27T01:29Z,"If I am backpedaling, like you call it, it is only becoz I don't take you that serious anymore. Oh comon, you really think you can win this from me? Why didn't you react on the theoretical piece I quoted from Delanda? Do you want me to start a lecture and quote from several books of which I am sure you would not understand them? Really, it was the easiest piece I could find. Anyway, like I said, whatever."
,boncuklar,2005-07-27T01:32Z,"Well, just go on giggling, like I said, I did not do a google for your pics and did not know what kind of pics they are. I though it sounded like weird to give away your identity. But if it is like you say, never mind, if you giggle that much about nothing, I understand your level of thinking."
,boncuklar,2005-07-27T04:07Z,"You know, to repeat: the problem with you for me is not the breast affair anymore, well, not because I could be wrong concerning that affair. I still consider it open for debate. I am not afraid to admit I am wrong, or I would never have become a prof. You know, people at the university don't like people who can't admit they're mistakes. Well, most people like me a lot, here where I work anyway, becoz I am always prepared to admit my wrong. What IS the problem then? The problem for me is: by defending the US at all cost, you are unknowingly agreeing or even underscoring or promoting the essentialist right wing metaphysical philosophical standpoint of the US. Without knowing what this standpoint exactly is or without being aware that you are underscoring it I am repeating. Becoz you maybe happen to know some facts, but do not know the philosophical issues at stake here. What bothers me with most people is exactly this: they will blindly keep repeating the same thing they think they know without being able or having the tools to reconsider them. The philosophical work of the thinkers I have mentioned could give you these tools. You could love America even more, but fight for a better america which could get rid of these obsolete essentialist ways of thinking. You can keep hating me or disliking me or whatever, but I suggest you very friendly, just take a look at some of the work that could be of use to you, maybe at the end you will not agree with it, but you will understand what I was talking about. It couldn't hurt could it? "
,Bongborg,2005-07-27T04:38Z,"""If I would be a wacko, I am very close to finding out where you live and who you are."" IF? IF? LMMFAOROTF."
,boncuklar,2005-07-27T04:47Z,"Hi there bongborg, nice to have you back too. (oh sweet irony) Are you ever going to make a contribution which would invite me to take it serious? hmm, let me guess... Think not! With which I am not suggesting redmags did make a contribution of any value, but at least she wrote some lengthy pieces which made it clear to me what she does know and what she doesn't. Why don't you write some of your ideas so we can think about those? "
,boncuklar,2005-07-27T04:56Z,"And by the way it was you bongborg that made me speak out all those terrible things about the US by telling me in one of your first posts that I struck you as an idiot. Without knowing who I was, how smart I could be or what the reason was of my criticism in the direction of the US. Next time, just try to be smart and ask someone why they have such a grudge against your country, maybe they may consider telling you in plain language, without feeling the need to insult you. Anyway, whatever, you two just amuse yourselves, I certainly did amuse myself enough about these two american cry-babies who couldn't handle the fact someone being so critical about their country. And maybe, just maybe, you two will consider this: I do know quite a bit about philosophy and stuff, but I do not know anything about the particularities of this case considering the breast. I had two days off from my work and was bored. You two gave me a great time. Neither of you told me anything that could impress me, but you two did give me a great time. I did learn how mindless some people are and what small souls they can have, if they have one. ROFL."
,Bongborg,2005-07-27T07:23Z,"I definitely ain't out to impress you, at all. I figure that would be a waste of time and noisy too. But don't be blaming your fucking terrible manners on me, asshole, I didn't type all that crazy shit down below, you did."
,boncuklar,2005-07-27T14:43Z,"Yes, I did, and I would do it again, if I would think you're worth it."
,beats4dayz,2005-07-28T02:30Z,"do you think you people could find some other arena for your trivial pursuits and maybe keep the comments on pirate bay about the torrent some of us are interested in?  maybe a rating of the quality of audio and video or perhaps a little history of the show?

redmags, why are you entertaining these idiots?  if you people hate america then great!  go fuck yourselfs in some other country"
,boncuklar,2005-07-28T02:56Z,"Oh and redmags, you were so eager to defend american law as something holy, so why are you here then, doing unlawful things at a torrent site? Oh wait, it was just convenient at the time I guess."
,Bongborg,2005-07-28T12:53Z,"You lost him somewhere around ""listen to me carefully"", dude."
,mellowx,2005-07-28T20:27Z,"I hate this, why don't you peoples tell us something that has to do with the torrent. Itis better than fighting each other. better for for us. I life in Belgium and there are here much rightwing people too. I would hate it this kind of histeria would blow over to my country. One breast, so much laws. Can't someone tell me where to find more info about it? I will fight this with all my strengt. POWER TO ANARCHISM!!! We want more breasts!Boncuklar, youare really brave man. Bush sux. Whenever you come to Belgie, you are welcome too stay at my home man. We will have some drink together. :) And can some people tell me why the smiliys don't work here. Repair that soon I hope. I speak french better. We don't want english here."
,redmags22,2005-07-28T20:56Z,"As requested by beats4dayz and mellowx
USA - Outlawing Indecency
Excellent quality and sound. I show it to students on a VERY large screen and it is eminently watchable.
Is not about what the American government is doing it is about what its citizens are lobbying the Government to do. If you are looking for another documentary bashing Baby Bush this isn?t for you ? if you?re interested in how far people are willing to go in defense of what they (not the entire country) consider decency/morals start dling now. Or if you?re just looking for reinforcement of the Americans as prudes stereotype this is for you!
Say what you want about America, it?s the only country I know of ? good or bad ? right or wrong ? that will stand up and shout ?we?re not gonna take it anymore? when they feel something is wrong.
Sorry, there's nothing at all about the evil that is Bush in here except that a realtive of his is mentioned!
Enjoy!"
,mellowx,2005-07-28T21:04Z,"hey boncuklar, they have french indymedia. together we are strong man. never mind this americans. Do you understand duthc by the way? redmags is wel een heel gefrustreerd wijf. laat haar toch lekker stikken man. wat ze nodig heeft is een stevige beurt. dat zal ze binnenkort wel een keer krijgen hahahaha. en kijken hoe gefrustreerd ze hierop reageert. ik weet zeker dat ze binnenkort gaat janken man."

,redmags22,2005-07-28T21:10Z,"nothing to do with frustration ? at least not on my part 
Sorry"
,redmags22,2005-07-28T21:32Z,"If you really are interested in what?s wrong with America, and I?m not saying you are ill informed or anything like that, I?d suggest tuning in to Al Franken, Jon Stewart, Bill Maher and or Dennis Miller. To find out why people like Boncuklar are the way they are may I suggest PBS Frontline?s A Class Divided. What Europe seems to forget or not to notice is that the American people themselves are America?s biggest and most vociferous critic. If Americans hadn?t made the majority of the documentaries the rest of the world wouldn?t have so much proof of how ?stupid? we truly are. "
,Bongborg,2005-07-28T23:23Z,"""I have saved the lives of 9 americans some years ago. Nothing heroic or anything. I just was the only guy at the right time and the right place."" What did you do, bonk-bonk, jump in front of a shit-eating dog?"
,boncuklar,2005-07-28T23:53Z,"Neeeh, Bongborg, nothing that silly. I have been in the army too once, in some other part of the world. Those americans still consider me their family by the way, whenever I visit the US. And they certainly don't have shit in their heads if that's what you're meaning. I will give you this much: I was just very upset and even without yuo reaching a hand, I take everything back. About the shit and the nuking and everything. There you have it. Now I'm gonna have me some beer with some friends, I hope you will do something like that too. Oh well, you know, life goes on and stuff. You can thank CadillacBoy by the way for this. He just gave me a very good feeling, I have trust again in humanity. That's never something bad. But I do need a strong drink. This shit (oops) has gone on long enough."

They don't want to. But some do. Not redmags. Go read indymedia. french: http://www.indymedia.org/fr/ Dutch: http://www.indymedia.org/nl/
,mellowx,2005-07-29T06:08Z,"Wow man. I didn't undersand much of it, but it sure sounds like poetry to me."
,mellowx,2005-07-29T18:50Z,"redmags, you are to dumb to understand this guy. He is a real philosopher. The world needs more like him. He should become president of the world. You just get lost go annoy other people. We know when someone speaks truth."
,redmags22,2005-07-29T19:17Z,"yes- clearly, it is my lack of intelligence that is the problem here! Killing entire continents of innocent human beings is a FABULOUS idea - I'm just too stupid to understand his/your vision. 
well I know the deal - what a suprising ""coincidence"" that you logged on minutes after he did! And at such a peculiar hour... hmmm what a conundrum.   I guess all despots need minions even if they are only in their minds(sic.) So I suppose you wish death to all ""americans"" as well?
The moral of the story: keep kids like boncuklar inside and furiously typing his hate and rage into a keyboard and you prevent another Columbine. If he has an outlet for his hate and rage he'll leave the worlds populace in peace!
He is a ""real"" quoter of philosphy - that's where it ends! "
,mellowx,2005-07-29T20:09Z,"Finally she is saying something true: ""yes- clearly, it is my lack of intelligence that is the problem here"". See, I also can literal quote."
,redmags22,2005-07-29T21:18Z,"again - shall I post your the entire transcript of your hate here or would you rather I sent it personally? Perhaps an FTP address for anyone who is interested? Or do you just want to wait for the book and keep lying to the good people here that you never in any of your myriad post wished deah by nuclear bomb on an entire continent? And that the ""shit filled heads of all Americans die""?"

,mellowx,2005-07-31T00:14Z,"By the way, he told me that he is going to discuss this thing to find out howmany people would agree with him at mvgroup, go take a look there too."
,redmags22,2005-07-31T01:59Z,"SYBIL: BTW Good luck with that. I'll mention that I have the transcripts and screenshots if anyone is interested, you know - just to clarify matters.

,DanneS,2005-08-03T17:08Z,"I think it's hilarious how some americans (and brits) are afraid of ""indecency"" but then again I live in Sweden where we make love whenever we want to and walk around nude at the beach without any senses of guilt. Free your body and your mind will follow. Fuck yourself to freedom. Repressed people make wars instead of love. "
,Son Of Mogh,2005-08-07T01:11Z,"These Americans have never seen indecency, let them come to Klingon Prime and taste somethin' really good. Quapla! to everyone who has the honor to be indecent! Or as my good friend Worf would say: It is a good day to be indecent and the day is not over yet! Bwahahaha, come friends let us drink some blood-wine and see this americans go wacko about one lousy tit as only they can. It is quite some show to entertain us till there is a new honorable battle."
