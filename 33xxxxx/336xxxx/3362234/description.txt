Comments: No, the sound quality rating above is *not* a typo. 'SB6' is the highest rating, and this release shattered that barrier, earning a 'sb7', with performances to match all around. A perfect, incredible release. Absolutely essential to have. Also check out front and back scans of the cards included with the set. Hats off to Mid Valley!
