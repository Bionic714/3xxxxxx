Vitamin Records’ latest offering, The String Quartet Tribute to Atreyu, blends dark, sinister beat-driven riffs with chilling thrums of the cello; eerie wails of violin and shadowy echoes of the viola. The result of this fusion is otherworldly; you may find the hairs on the back of your neck stand at attention and the temperature in the room lowers several degrees. This is raw strings at their gothic best.
