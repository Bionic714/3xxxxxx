A request for "Regina"...Here it is.  Can't believe this movie wasn't already on here.  The only movie which address the whole "scene" at once, and from the 80's at that.  Vespas, mods, and all the shit that pisses me off. A very good movie.

Mini Plot:

Two punks live in Salt Lake City. The film covers their all-day routine. The realism of the character-narrated movie may be discussed. One of the punks gets ill, stays in hospital for three weeks, comes out again. Three parties are covered and one concert including a fight between punks, rednecks and others.
