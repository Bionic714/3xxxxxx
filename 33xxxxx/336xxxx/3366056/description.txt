Hard psychedelic blues with harmonica, weird spanish vocals, fuzzed geetarsolos adn just about all trippy weirdness this genre has to offer. Not the most important songs in the world but its still great garagefun, and hey, thats not bad at all in my book. Copies of Cerebrums two singles go for about 30-40 pounds each on the rare occasions when they are up for sale.

From The spanish progressive rock encyclopedia:
They recorded two singles by late 60s-early 70s and rapidly they splitted, giving birth to a new band named Delirium Tremens. Other members of the group kept on as Cerebrum without any new recordings. The journalist Jordi Serra i Fabra wrote: "Cerebrum are the summit of spanish progressive music. Their music is revolutionary and experimental. They components are young and unquiet, hopefull and plenty of that force that pushes to succeess, to security... Cerebrum is with no doubt a musical experiment, a synthesis of strengthin the grooves of a single." It seems that the second version of Cerebrum hosted the first musical steps of the guitarrist Salvador Dom√≠nguez.
