Tack för uploaden i alla fall, älskar detta spelet!"

Almost 4 months ago, WAM released Gladius.XBOX-WAM for the X-Box 
This highly anticipated strategic RPG was enjoyed by many over the 
holiday season.  Murmours rippled through the scene about how the 
game would crash and not let players defeat the cyclops king, which 
is required to beat the game!  So team SCRAM decided we would play 
test this excellent title our self.  We were really getting into 
the game and WAM, it crashed!  Disc dirty, im playing it off the 
harddrive!  So we tried again on three other systems with different 
mods and dashboards, but no luck... We just couldnt get it to fly. 
Now we realize it may seem like deviant behaviour to proper after 
four whole months, but deviance aside, this is a major title that 
the RPG gamers of the scene should truley beable to enjoy!  
(nukers beware, the cyclops king is 50-60hours into it) 

Unpack, burn or copy to your hard drive, and enjoy! 

If you enjoy this proper working game, buy it! Lucas Arts is 
developing some of their first decent original games in many years! "

Battle system is a little slow and annoying but ain't nothing wrong with that.

Level ups seem pretty slow, but that's cool."
,Divyx,2005-08-04T21:01Z,"I think this game was always underrated, this  is VERY GOOD game for all rpg/tactical games fans. I love it. It has easily over 70 totally enjoyable gaming houers compared to the usual 17-25 houers of gameplay. "
,cutter08,2005-08-14T02:11Z,"I finally finished downloading this, unfortunetly it won't work for me.  After unpacking the rar file, the iso file has no info to unpack.  Being able to only understand english, I don't know if any of the other comments have any information that will help me out.  Maybe someone will be able to tell me what I'm doing wrong.  Either way, thx for the upload, and I will appreciate it even more if I can get it working."
