,DaddyHorseSense,2008-01-15T17:42Z,"I think that this is every album (not singles) up to September 1993, apart from the Dire Straits Box Set (released in Japan) and a few compilation albums.  The following have been released since:

BROTHERS IN CONVERSATION 
LIVE AT THE BBC 
SULTANS OF SWING - THE VERY BEST OF DIRE STRAITS 
15 PRIVATE INVESTIGATIONS: THE BEST OF DIRE STRAITS & MARK KNOPFLER 

Other than that, they had a Warner Brothers Musical Show album, and a series of interviews released on CD (possibly also DVD), some time ago, but this does seem to be the complete Dire Straits album discography to 1993, for worldwide releases.

Many thanks, when it's down I'll seed it for a time."
