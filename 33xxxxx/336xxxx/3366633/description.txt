 Exclusive Tip  
 
 
Looking for a little extra loot in Thief: Deadly Shadows? Why not let yourself get caught? The first time the city guards nab you, they won?t kill you?they?ll just toss you in the clink. Escaping from prison gives you the chance to rob the joint as well, and you?d be surprised how much loot is sitting around in that deep, dark dock. You only go to jail once, though. After you break out, the guards will kill you, so watch yourself.
