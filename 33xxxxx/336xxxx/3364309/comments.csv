,Soulbringer,2006-04-03T03:51Z,Anyone want to seed this for a little longer? 
,Soulbringer,2006-04-03T03:54Z,"Oh and to answer your question piglet, the bin file is a cd image. You need software that can either burn the image to a cd or ""mount"" it to your hard drive. Mounting just means that you are creating a virtual cd drive that the game will think it is installing from. I use Nero Burning ROM to burn cd images and Daemon Tools to mount the images. For something that is like this (only one cd) daemon tools is probably easier. There are many tutorials on how to use it, just search the net."

Fortunately, they don't need to be run (Win XP already has it, at least from sp2 or what), so just ignore them."
