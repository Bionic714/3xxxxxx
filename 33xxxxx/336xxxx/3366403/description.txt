This a Great Album From the Detroit duo. It`s Hip-Hop/Rap/R&B at its best!!
Its 3 of the songs are Mp3 the rest is WMA. Its good quality since its bought on iTunes, and converted so you can play it on Winamp, WMP or another mp3 player than ipod. Its getting top grades from most of the medias and eksperts, its a album you want to listen to again and again.
