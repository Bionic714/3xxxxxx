,Shadowvortekkx,2005-08-13T03:48Z,Can anyone tell me if this game is any good or worth downloading? Im Downloading Dungeon Seige 2 now and dont know if i should add this one
,mulle27,2005-08-13T16:36Z,":""Humping_Jack_Flash"": should the change be set
in all 4 discs or just the first? Can´t make it work
with daemontools either. It´s allready changed to
as what you described on disc 1, but the long
command line remains in disc 2,3,4. I haven´t 
made any changes myself yet. "
,Humping_jack_flash,2005-08-14T20:20Z,"!! Answer !! Sorry, my fault that i was unclear.. U have to change the first line into the filname of the .bin file. that means --> FILE ""DEV-BR2C.BIN"" BINARY 3 --> BR2C. BIN is cd number 3.. and FILE ""DEV-BR2D.BIN"" BINARY 3 would be cd nr 4.. if u still dont get it to work.. then ur doomed."
,Humping_jack_flash,2005-08-14T20:26Z,"!! Shadow !!  The game is good, if u like a Brainless Killing game. im not fucking with u, this game is onley fun when u use cheats. they try to make the game difficult by making it hard to get from a to b.. but... i would download it "
