This is Sci-Fi.

,wrxwrn,2007-01-15T00:32Z,Please could somebody seed this?
,bignowhere,2008-03-02T13:38Z,"Hi Wolf, I'd really appreciate a reseed of this if possible. I know its been going on 3 years since you first put it on but,....................what can I say. Missed it :("
,so_say_we_all,2008-05-27T13:42Z,"Hi wolf359

Would it be possible for you to re-seed this and disc 2 please? I've actually registered for the chance to request this stunning piece of tv history. With a name like 'wolf359' I should say 'resistance is futile' (but I won't!) Cheers, in anticipation. I will seed it myself for 6 months to give this torrent life again.  "
,Aquajac,2010-09-27T00:12Z,Please seed!!! I downloaded this torrent over 6 months ago and am still waiting for it to start d/l - I really loved this show.PLeeease!!!
[V],joshua13,2011-09-30T23:43Z,just to forestall anyone else requesting seeds - the chance of wolf359 looking back at this old torrent for new comments is nearly zero. this is why I wish TPB  allowed PMs or could notify unloaders of comments like many other sites do
