Waves Q-Clone
        is   a   revolutionary  new  product  utilizing  unique 
        (patent-pending)  technology  that  lets  you  use  your outboard 
        hardware  equalizer  in  a  completely  new way. By capturing the 
        sound  of  your  own  gear,  Q-Clone allows you to use that sound 
        freely  throughout  your  session,  adjusting  the  sound of each 
        track  just  as you would if you had dozens of that same hardware 
        equalizer. 
                  
        Let?s  be  clear:  we?re  not  talking  about mousing around on a 
        plug-in  ?simulation?  with  ?virtual?  knobs.  You?re using YOUR 
        gear,  not  a  software  version  of  it.  Turn the knobs on your 
        classic  box?Q-Clone  captures  and holds the exact sound in real 
        time.
