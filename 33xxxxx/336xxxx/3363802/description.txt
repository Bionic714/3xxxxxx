                                 Introduction
                                 ____________

The Wacky Ned Archive is the largest erotic Simpsons collection ever compiled.
It includes more than 3,000 drawings, over 300 animations, movies, shockwaves,
games, kisekae dolls, sounds, and more than 100 lemons by 240+ erotica artists
and writers. Best of all, it's free. What a concept.


                  What happened to the Wacky Ned ZIP files?
                  _________________________________________

The Wacky Ned Archive ZIP files became disorganized and hard to manage. They
are now obsolete and have been replaced with the new RAR volumes. If you still
have copies of the ZIP files, delete them along with everything ever unpacked
from them. The first RAR volume holds everything from ZIP series 1 through 12,
plus 80 MB of new stuff! Future volumes will come in RAR format too.



                         How do I contact Wacky Ned?
                         ___________________________

You can't! Wacky Ned is the name of this archive, not its shy caretakers. The
first download site was called Wacky Ned's Erotic Simpsons Collection because
it showed Ned Flanders maniacally laughing beside the download links. The joke
was that Flanders collected dirty pics of his own neighbors. The name stuck
and belatedly it became The Wacky Ned Archive.

The caretakers do not communicate by e-mail. We read Usenet newsgroups like
alt.binaries.nospam.simpsons-pr0n and alt.binaries.nospam.toons for comments
or submissions. New Wacky Ned Archive volumes are posted in them too.
