,SinIC,2005-08-15T15:52Z,"I believe this is the english version. It has been released in Hungary and in UK i think. Havent tried it my self yet. No translation pack, that im certain of."
,WogVoorhees,2005-08-15T16:50Z,Is Part 9 broken? It doesn't extract. Can you please upload part9 for me? Pleease!! 
,WogVoorhees,2005-08-15T16:52Z,"Tried newer WinRar to extract it and everything, but still error while extracting part9. Maybe an error while I downloaded it."
,WogVoorhees,2005-08-16T08:31Z,"Thank you. :) Started downloading that ""Part09.rar"""
,reptile256,2005-08-16T09:48Z,"thanks a lot.

,Spaceone,2005-08-16T12:10Z,"Hey, in the start of the game, when you talking to magician, there is some audio missing (example: when you ask him about the stone tablet). "
,WogVoorhees,2005-08-16T12:18Z,Maybe they couldn't hire Xardas' voice actor again. Are there many addon voices missing?
,Spaceone,2005-08-16T12:36Z,"yeah, also Calvaron hasn't any speech. 
Nobody come across this problem?

Maybe is that german crack fault. But I can't play without it (with mounted iso)."
,WogVoorhees,2005-08-16T13:48Z,"I'm almost certain, that it is German Crack fault. There is no AddonSpeech and not even subtitles! Could someone tell me where i can find Eng. Crack for Addon?"
,WogVoorhees,2005-08-16T13:55Z,And speechFiles are ok. German crack just doesnt read them.
,Spaceone,2005-08-16T14:13Z,"Well, I manage to do that:
1. install english Gothic2
2. install this english notr addon
3. install update v2.6 german
----
now I have english speech and german text (at least at the begining and there is also english speech, which it hasn't been there before)
----
4. I installed english transtations G2aTT-G2TNoTR_v1.0.exe.
---
Now I have both english text and speech, but they don't came well together :)."
,WogVoorhees,2005-08-16T14:20Z,wow :D quite clever ;) (Y) I'll try.
,WogVoorhees,2005-08-16T14:22Z,Oh... and Thanks! :)
,WogVoorhees,2005-08-16T14:25Z,"Are you from World Of Gothic? Just curious.. 
I am."
,Spaceone,2005-08-16T14:56Z,"No, i'm not. Maybe I'll join ;)"
,TimmyP,2005-08-17T18:39Z,"Hey I figured it out.

Go into your
Gothic2_workDataScriptsContentCutscene

and rename OU.DAT to OU.BIN
and OU.lsc to OU.csl

Full english finally!"
,TimmyP,2005-08-17T18:43Z,"BTW if you already have those files in there, delete them and then rename."
,TimmyP,2005-08-17T20:02Z,"Just so you know, if a patch or nocd crack comes out for this, you will need to rename them back to their original names before you use the crack or patch.

Your Welcome!"
