,starquest714,2008-07-15T06:18Z,Porbably need Apple Quicktime to run....the older versions did. Thanks for the upload. This is the best Stargazing prog out there!!
,orsoncart67,2008-12-18T17:57Z,"this program comes as three .iso  you need to mount them useing daemon tools!!!
i'm not going into specifics on how this is done
this IS because I think YOU have google!!
type into google     how do i mount an iso image
job done!"
,Osiris69,2008-12-27T12:59Z,"You're welcome, gang! This IS a great stargazing program. It worked for me just fine. If you're having trouble running it, make sure you have newer versions of QuickTime, the latest Windows updates, and the latest version of drivers for your video card installed. Starry Night Pro is a resource hawg so make sure your PC is up to speed to run this program effectively.

For you first timers to Starry Night Pro, get ready for a treat. In my opinion, nothing else comes close to the level of detail and information you get from any other stargazing program out there. Enjoy!

I am currently trying to install the software. It is going so slow, but I haven't had trouble. I think what you need to do is MOUNT the 3 images in 3 different virtual drives. When you get the message to insert Disk 2, select browse... browse through your computer and select the new virtual drive (H, I, J, K... for example) with the ISO image #2. Same steps when inserting Disk 3. Hope this helps."
,what_do_i_know,2009-03-15T02:17Z,"This is what I did to get it to work on Vista.
Used Magic Disc and mounted CD 1, Disk 1, Inst Data, Windows, VM, double click install
After a stall failed attempt, I started task manager forcing the installation to cancel.
Vista then asked if the program installed fine or reinstall using recommended setting.
I chose to reinstall with recommended settings.
It installed after this properly.
Hope this helps Vista users.

,sevenarmy,2009-04-08T15:03Z,Check out The Star of Bethlehem Documentary it backs up the factsabout the birth of Jesus Christ!!!! Got to 2 B.C. Dec 25 . 5 miles south of Iraq tha is Bethlehem youll see Jupiter sirl into a halo at the feet of Leo constellation in Greek meaning King. Also next to Jupiter is Venus which means virgin in Greek. Also in the book of Revalation youll see John has written about stars and signs in the skies. See for yourselves it is amazing in an Astrological sense and more so in a Biblical sense. God be with you all!!!!!!!!
