Here's a reissue of the debut solo album from Rita Lee of Os Mutantes, Brazil's greatest rock band. (And since the other members of the band play on Build Up , it practically qualifies as an Os Mutantes record.) Released in 1970, the CD is a total delight, vintage tropicalia with elements of folk, pop and psychedelia. The album was arranged by Rogerio Duprat, Brazil's greatest arranger from that country's tropicalia heydey, guiding the works of such Brazilian superstars as Caetano Veloso, Gal Costa, Gilberto Gil and Tom Ze. An obvious must for Os Mutantes fans and devotees of Brazilian music in general. Songs include Lee originals and a loopy, psychedelic cover of the Beatles' "And I Love Her" (sung "And I Love Him," of course). As for Lee, she's continued to have a successful recording career, long after the breakup of Os Mutantes in 1973. But not without a few bumps along the way: She was accused by the Brazilian military (not without justification, It is believed that she wanted to contaminate Sao Paulo's water supply with LSD. Too weird!
