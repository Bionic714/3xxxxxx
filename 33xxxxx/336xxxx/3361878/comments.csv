,tikkig0d,2008-10-11T00:32Z,indeed bsplayer is good
,kjackson,2009-01-29T06:40Z,"Thanks for the upload.

Just so people know, this version is completely dubbed over in Thai.  It doesn't have the original Thai/Japanese/English audio.

Also, the video seems a bit dark (compared to three other rips I checked)."
,sylh,2010-05-09T23:45Z,anyone have a link for the version thats not dubbed?
