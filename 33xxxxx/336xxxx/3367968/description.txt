Eric Jon Phelps - Vatican Assassins: "Wounded In The House Of My Friends" 



Vatican Assassins: "Wounded In The House Of My Friends", gives the past and present
diabolical history of the Society of Jesus. Its Second Thirty Years's War (1914-1945), including the Jewish, Lutheran, Orthodox and Buddhist Holocausts, was vengeance for the continuation of the killing of "accursed heretics and liberals" pursuant to the Counsil of Trent - upheld by the Second Vatican Counsel - while using both the American and Soviet Empires to erect dictators worldwide who were secretly or openly loyal to the Pope. But President Kennedy attempted to end the Cold War prematurly, for which he paid with his life. In control of the Attorney General, the Justice Department and the Attorny General, the Justice Department and the FBI, New York Archbishops Spellman, Cooke, O'Connor and Egan have coverd it up, thereby preventing justice from being served - until now!
