,Frohike,2006-02-13T12:24Z,"Koling: Haha, level of geekness in that comment? Refer to each other by their IP instead of name... ;)"
,lagtea,2006-04-27T08:33Z,"Koling: You are stupid who leaves out someones IP...

Frohike: You are even more stupid, you dumb shitheadmotherfucker... How the FUCK should Koling be able to know what name the IP:s owner is?? "
,Grubbalicious,2006-05-16T21:56Z,"torrent software usually displays the ips of connected parties, so that's how...and yea, that IP should be booted. I try and keep 1/ or 1/1.5 at least. Leechers suck."
,cretan,2006-08-24T12:36Z,Please seed!
,Polack,2006-11-08T23:08Z,Dont fucking dare to stop seeding
,Polack,2006-11-08T23:08Z,CUZ TIHS SHIT IS AWESUm
,peacepunk,2006-11-14T08:43Z,I don't get it.  I've downloaded this awesome TV show and none of my media players will recognize the .avi files for this show.  Am I doing something wrong?  I've download other TV shows and they work fine! 
,Pinnebarn,2007-02-25T10:29Z,Please seed... Stuck at 7.6%!!! No one out there who can help?
,vonvargen,2007-05-11T14:33Z,"Seed please, I love this show"
,mrcabletek,2007-08-21T08:04Z,Would everyone stop hit and running on this torrent please? I can't seed this back forever.
,lodestone77,2007-09-25T09:19Z,"This collection of Kids in the Hall episodes is missing tons of episodes!!!
For those who are interested, here is a breakdown of what is missing from the pack:
Season 2: Episodes 2 and 5
Season 3: Episode 8
Season 4: Episodes 15 to 20
tv.com and other lame, ad-riddled websites, list each season as having 22 episodes.  This is NOT true.  The first 4 seasons all had 20 episodes plus 2 'best of' specials at the end of each season (one aired on CBC in canada and teh other on HBO).  The fifth season had 21 episodes plus a best-of special.  tghe first season also had a pilot in addition to the 20 episode main run.
For more info check this excellent wiki article:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kids_in_the_Hall_episodes"
,lodestone77,2007-09-25T09:24Z,"also be advised that the episode list may not be the same as these episodes, as I believe the digitaldistraction rips are from the CBC broadcasts, wheres the official dvds use the HBO broasdcasts for seasons 1-3 and the CBC broadcasts for the last 2 seasons...complimicated..."
,Frohike,2007-10-16T15:48Z,lagtea: I didn't say that he should know the names of the ppl. I wonder who's stupid...

,johnnytoobad,2008-03-09T20:16Z,"If this does not seed, I swear to Vishnu, Allah, and L. Ron Hubbard all at once that I will travel through the Internet and remove your big toe. The right one, not the left."
,HeadToe,2008-03-28T09:46Z,"Hey, this is a fabulous torrent!  Please seed when your done kids. Peace&Love from Oregon,U.S.A.!!!"

[T],Pharos2001,2010-01-03T17:57Z,"I have all the missing episodes except the 'Best of' episodes.
All of S1 through S5. I will not post these individually due to lack of leech/seed candidates."

,hummarstra,2010-02-14T22:14Z,"I want to say thanks for posting this, but I gotta be honest: the video quality of these episodes is a bit grainy and disappointing. No one else has mentioned this, but it needs to be said. The 3rd season DVD rip here on PB is good quality though."
,OrpheusDude,2010-05-06T07:34Z,"I found a solution to get the complete show.  Download Seasons 1 & 5 from this torrent.  Then use FindTorrent to locate the 2nd through 4th seasons.  It may take a while for it all to download, but at least it's all there.  Right now, seasons 1-3 and 5 have ETAs of between 8 hours and 1 day 21 hours; 4 is slower, with an ETA of 2 weeks 2 days.  I can wait."
,mitjak,2010-08-22T07:12Z,"Another thing worth pointing out: all these episodes are the censored versions. Yes, that means far less swearing, bleeping, and the biggest offense of all: PUTRID SOUP INSTEAD OF SHITTY SOUP.

I just might have to go buy the DVDs purely because of the latter.."
,chicken-,2011-03-01T00:30Z,"Regarding mitjak's post:
I can't even recall which episode(s), as I was watching random ones from season 2 and season 4 I believe, but I watched at least 2 uncensored episodes that had swears in it, so these are not all censored.  "
,chicken-,2011-03-01T00:32Z,"Pharos2001, not sure why you posted saying you have all the missing episodes, all you have is season 3."
