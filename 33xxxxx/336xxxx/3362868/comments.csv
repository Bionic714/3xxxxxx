I guess from the comment Application Disk not included that i will need some other software to make this work sorry if i sound dumb lol but im not familiar with rosetta stone products. Can anyone pleas tell me where i can get the Application and or the name or version i need so i can search for it i really need to learn greek and this would be a great help
,Aggiesl,2008-04-10T03:06Z,Thanx trekkieman really great torrent thank u. It downloaded fast lots seeding and i figured out about the application program its all working perfectly
,No_papi,2008-04-22T05:00Z,"I cannot seem to get it to work. I mount the images and than when I try to add the language packs into Rosetta I get the error message ""Problems were encountered attempting to locate a language CD. See your Quick Card Start or visit www.rosettastone.com/support""

What do I do? My Daemon tools is working perfectly."
,thelastlocust,2008-05-16T00:57Z,"I am currently downloading this now, and I have read that you do not have the application program here, so where do I find it?"
,MrBoods,2008-08-11T16:08Z,"i cant get rosetta to recognize this image. ive tried mounting with Daemon tools and alcohol 52%, and burned a copy of extracted files. please help!"
,ilyjamiee,2008-09-16T22:50Z,"I cant get this to work, i've tried burning it and using daemon tools, i have the rosetta stone application but i dont know how to install the language, help please?! "
,beurk,2008-09-21T22:49Z,"Hi, I can't have this language working on my RS. I first installed v3, which works perfectly for v3 languages (German and Italian), but not for Greek. RS cannot find the image of the file mounted. So I resorted to using an older version. First v2.0.6A: the file was recognized but couldn't load (apparently, due to missing files). Then I tried v2.1.5.1A, when I run the software it asks for a cd then switch off. How do you guys have the Greek lessons working on RS? Learning Greek being the main reason I decided to try RS..."
,beurk,2008-09-22T00:35Z,"Well, it works fine on v2.0.8.1A (link here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3512315/The_Rosetta_Stone_-_Western_Languages_-_Fixed___Application - you don't have to take all the files, just the application).

I hope they make Greek available on v3 sometime soon. Compared to v3 v2 is rather ugly, and more difficult for a complete beginner. But still I have it working now!"
,thebiggerm,2009-01-04T10:07Z,anyone found greek for rosetta stone V 3?
,catgirlpink,2009-05-14T02:21Z,"I couldn't use this download, Version 3 won't recognize it.  Then I got hit with a legal warning for downloading Rosetta Stone, and they said it was for downloading the Greek CD.  :("
