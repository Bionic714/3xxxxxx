Here are all the Dare albums I was able to find. Included is 4 studio albums, 2 live recording and one with some rare song.

2005 they released a live DVD and album, the Power of Nature, but I cannot find it anywhere.

Anyway, here is that the torrent contains. Quality is for most part 192 or better (except live).

I have a similar torrent up and running earlier, but I realized one Album was missing from that one (Belief) so made a new one.
