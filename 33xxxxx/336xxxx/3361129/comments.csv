,PSIR,2005-08-05T15:16Z,"This is - The Wall MOVIE Soundtrack. 
You can even hear the MGM Lion Roar at the start. 
In the movie Bob Geldof sings, I prefer Roger Waters and David Gilmour singing. 
The original ""Pink Floyd The wall"" Audio album is MUCH better, better arrangement and music. 

I enjoy this release also, good work ""PaulusPL""! 

If anyone have the original ""Pink Floyd The wall"" Audio album in a real DTS / Quad Mix. 
Please seed. 
Thanx"
