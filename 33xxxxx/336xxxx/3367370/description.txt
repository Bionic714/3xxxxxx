NOTES:  It only took me about 2-3 seconds to change the tape from side a to side b, so I just lost the last note of "God Will Lift Up Your Head."  The tape ran dry after capturing most but not quite all of "All My Tears."  Jars played "I'll Fly Away" after that, which was not taped by myself.  I left during "I'll Fly Away," so I don't know if they played anything else.  Please note that this was the second of two sets, played at 5:15 pm and 8:15 pm that night.  I didn't attend the first set.  Chris Lehman told me he planned on videotaping both performances.  If he did, his recording probably sounds a lot better than mine, recorded on a telephone-quality microcassette.  However, until his recording surfaces, mine may entertain.  Enjoy!
