,aradiel,2009-07-09T04:34Z,"I haven't been here for a while, but basically it burns to a CD. I used Alcohol 120% and that's pretty much it.

I did upload a lot more light gun games than this, but TPB seems to have deleted most of the torrents for some reason."
,aradiel,2009-07-09T04:59Z,"Also, for those interested, there are now 16 PS2 games that use light gun(s):

Cocoto Fun Fair, Dino Stalker, Endgame, Guncom 2, Gun Fighter 2, Gunvari Collection (Japanese PS2 port of Point Blank 1-3 and Time Crisis for PSX), Ninja Assault, Resident Evil: Dead Aim, Resident Evil: Code Veronica, Starsky & Hutch, Time Crisis 2, Time Crisis 3, Time Crisis: Crisis Zone, Vampire Night and Virtua Cop (this torrent)."
