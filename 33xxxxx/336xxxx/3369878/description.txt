Usually I don't make reseeds of my torrents since they are all deleted once distributed but this is a small one so it was easy to make a new one (it was a request).

Reseeding torrents every now and then would become a nuisance to a lot of people, probably. My HDD capacity is limited and reseeding films would mean I would have to re-process them and it would reduce my possibilities of uploading new ones since I have to erase torrents and films uploaded earlier. For example, The Monkey's Mask is now gone from my system. This means that torrents will have to die here at Pirate Bay when people see fit.

Anyway, here's a new chance to see and hear what the author of Tipping the Velvet (Sarah Waters) and the adaptor (Andrew Davies) say on their work. (I think I incorrectly credited Geoffrey Sax with being an interviewee the first time I uploaded this interview clip.)
