,NisseP,2005-08-10T07:48Z,I guess the videos are from 3dBuzz.com.
,krum,2005-08-11T20:33Z,"Excellent, I've already learnt a lot, thank you VERY much :)"
,Raymeo,2008-08-08T13:12Z,"There are 3 to 4 people involved in presenting this video. If that doesn't put you off, the stupid smart arse comments of the bimbo is sure to.  There are much better PHP Video Tutorials available. I deleted the the whole tutorial set after 10 mins. Unbearable."
,huanix,2008-09-07T16:51Z,I suggest that you give these videos a try for yourself before you take Raymeo's word. I have been a big fan of the 3dBuzz tutorials for a long time - they teach concrete examples in a conversational style; very effective in my opinion.
,iceman45,2008-12-03T18:40Z,"Yeah 3dbuzz tutorials are good for newies. The bimbo is entertaining and the whole dialog is entertaining and livens things up as they are always joking around. Nothing wrong with that, it's a plus. 

I wish their C# tuts were on here too. "
