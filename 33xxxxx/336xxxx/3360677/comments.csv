,freakindutch,2006-04-23T02:03Z,"I was reading the comments on here and I figured I'd help some of you out, or at least try to. To those of you having trouble switching discs, I'm assuming you're using daemon tools. To change the discs right click daemon in the tray at the lower right of ur screen, go to virtual CD/DVD Rom, Device 0 ( or watever is there), mount image, then click on the second CD. If u cant see the taskbar during the installation, just hit the windows button on ur keyboard. When it asks for CD3, and CD4 just do the same thing."

,borosd,2008-03-20T01:07Z,"Hey, Ive got this problem.
I bought this game, but lost the CD 4, so downloaded it. However, when I run the instalation, the installer asks me to insert cd 4 inte the H drive (my cd drive), and for some reason I cant mount it to the H drive with Deamon tools, and when trying to mount it to the default drive the installer doesn't react.

It's been long since I was able to play the last time, would be nice with some assistance :)

Thanks"
,dzldriver,2008-04-05T16:48Z,"borosd.

Simply put... I can't run the game and I don't know why. I did the complete install.

I will be sure to seed more, but I'd love to actually be able to play. Thank you!"
,Zartav,2008-12-06T11:02Z,"NEver mind. I figured it out. The crack is located INSIDE the CD4. You take it, and paste it over the fs9 in the game folder. It'll work just fine there after."
