,Elias-T,2009-07-24T02:52Z,"Nice torrent...

BUT I have a problem; the same one as pes4rules11 actually...

So first of all, I don't know if I extracted and installed this thing correctly...  You compressed a .rar inside of another .rar?  I extracted once, then had to extract AGAIN to get the files...

So I ran setup.exe and I assume it installed properly.  Then when I tried to run it, it tells me I need the CD.  So I got a CD crack, then ran it again.  Now at least the darn thing runs, but after displaying the Sierra welcome screen or whatever, my screen goes black...  I hit alt + f4 to quit and it gave me the ""are you sure"" screen, but the window was in-game styling, like pipes and stuff.  So I guess the program is running, I'm just having display problems...

Anybody have any insight?"
,ArachD206,2009-11-13T12:09Z,"Awesome, i used to play this when i was a kid. Thanks alot! :D"
,hinweis2k,2010-09-15T23:39Z,"I figured out the black screen problem: 

1:Go to the folder where you have extraced the files from the PowerISO.
2:Click ""Contraptions/Files""
3:Now copy all files and paste it in the folder where you have installed the game.

hope it worked, it did for me atleast^^"
,skulldragon,2011-10-01T01:06Z,"You have to download a no-CD fix for TIM-EMC from elsewhere. The only one available is at GCW.
1. There is nothing told about required files needed to be copied into the game dir. Those files are Intro.tbv and Music.tbv - put them into your game dir.
2. DO NOT run EVENMORE.reg as it is not needed at all and will actually mess up TIM-EMC - no Digital music will play.

After you have set up the required files, you can finally start playing."
,enonumus,2012-03-30T08:30Z,"Didn't even know they made this one.  I played the original TIM in the early 90's, no doubt I downloaded it off a private BBS, probably with a 9600 baud modem, maybe even 2400 baud.  TIM was one of THE best games ever.  It would make an awesome Android game nowadays."
,Occular,2012-05-04T21:55Z,"Nice I didn't realize TIM still existed even in the archives, awesome addition.  For those wishing it was a little more modern, try Crazy Machine Elements, it is essentially the modern equivalent."
