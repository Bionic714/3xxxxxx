Full Metal Challenge

Complete first series.
From info file:
-----
This is the first and the last season of the UK Channel4's show Full Metal Challenge.  

27 teams from around the world on a budget of 2000# built vehicles to do anything, go anywhere, cross any obstacle.  

In a disused power station in Kent, UK, these machines were tested until a winner was determined in a series of 13 shows.  

This is that series.
