,ursa1,2008-08-09T00:02Z,the .sub file contains english subtitles. i converted it to .ssa and used virtualdub to combine the subtitles into the movie BUT these english language subtitles are the worst. my advice if you speak english: stay away from this download. i need to find another tristana that has decent english subtitles.
,cromike,2009-03-10T21:14Z,"Look, there are only two Tristana videos. I am not sure which one I downloaded, but I think that it was this one. The download worked perfectly and the A/V quality is good. I speak Spanish and wanted it for that reason but as a matter of comment - the subtitles are a terrible translation. TERRIBLE. Other than that, great download."
,Mocanu,2010-12-27T23:26Z,just a simple thank for this nice movie
,scriabinist1986,2011-06-04T22:42Z,"Use this subtitle for Tristana, it's the best I could find for it on the internet: http://subscene.com/english/Tristana/subtitle-103238.aspx"
,erPlay,2012-04-26T10:56Z,A/V???
