Spain, in the 1920s.  After the death of her mother, a beautiful young woman, Tristana, becomes the ward of a respectable but impecunious aristocrat, Don Lope.  The latter refuses to work for a living, deeming this to be beneath his dignity, and spends most of his time voicing his socialist and anti-religious opinions, often with a large dose of hypocrisy.  He secretly takes advantage of his ward whilst publicly making great virtue of his self-restraint.  A rift quickly develops between Tristana and Don Lope when the young woman meets and falls in love with an artist, Horacio.  Tristana is driven by Lope?s jealousy to elope with the artist, but returns a few years later, grievously ill, begging to stay in Lope?s house?
