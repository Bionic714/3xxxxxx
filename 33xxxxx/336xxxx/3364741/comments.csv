What about another countries:FRANCE, BRITAN,
GERMANY, JAPAN, CHINA, RUSIA-all thise countries tried to invest as much as they can.
 Politic rules the World  and it's in everyvere:
in resurces especially.
 And this is not US fault if oil became so
expensive, loock at the RUSIA, he tries  to be
everywhere, outside and inside, for oil they are
making problems in GEORGIA, CHECHNYA, IRAQ, IRAN,  N.COREA-THEY ARE #1 world
ENEMY, they started CIVIL WAR.

Haha. At least the representation of the american dream is close to the truth, miserable, dusty, megalomaniac, aggressive and dumb. Not worth being watched."
,PenPusher,2005-08-04T20:32Z,"Making the assumption that ""broadcast[ed] in [...] Sweden"" is referring to the state television of Sweden, such a fact show what type of documentary this is and is not to be taken as a token of quality or stringency in claims."
,IlyaZ,2005-08-15T01:14Z,"So if a movie you like is broadcasted in Sweden, does it make it worse? It's better to educate people than not doing it. Thus it's better to show documentaries than not doing it."
