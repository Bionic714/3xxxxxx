The End of Suburbia...

Oil Depletion and the Collapse of the American Dream
Hosted by Barrie Zwicker

Since World War II North Americans have invested much of their newfound wealth in suburbia. It has promised a sense of space, affordability, family life and upward mobility. As the population of suburban sprawl has exploded in the past 50 years, so too has the suburban way of life become embedded in the American consciousness.

Suburbia, and all it promises, has become the American Dream.

But as we enter the 21st century, serious questions are beginning to emerge about the sustainability of this way of life. With brutal honesty and a touch of irony, The End of Suburbia explores the American Way of Life and its prospects as the planet approaches a critical era, as global demand for fossil fuels begins to outstrip supply. World Oil Peak and the inevitable decline of fossil fuels are upon us now, some scientists and policy makers argue in this documentary.

Since its release in May of 2004, the documentary has seen a steady increase in popularity. It has been featured in more than a dozen film festivals, broadcast in Canada and Sweden and has sold over 10,000 copies. Grass-roots efforts by groups and individuals have resulted in hundreds of screenings worldwide. The current DVD release includes a 12-page resource booklet from the Post Carbon Institute.

This 78 minute documentary also includes the vintage short films, "In the Suburbs" and "Destination Earth" as bonus material!
