Super GT:Lamborgini
Banshee:Porsh(Dont know how to spell it)

,luczinho,2005-08-13T21:14Z,"jasa i made like you say, i have deleted the save, i reboot and paste the old save, then i try to load but it crashes on the load game =/"
,luczinho,2005-08-13T21:16Z,any help? =(
,edsn,2005-08-13T21:35Z,i dont think that you can play with your old saves due to the game mods so im afraid you will have to start from scratch unless someone with the same mods uplaod a save.
,edsn,2005-08-13T21:41Z,have you tried playing it without a save to check that the game runs so that you know that you copied the right files
,luczinho,2005-08-13T22:01Z,"damn it doesn't work =( i have all 100% =((

but thx for your help =]"

,jasa2005,2005-08-14T15:51Z,You need to start from the begining.Delete all San Andreas Saves and Star from beigining!!!
,luczinho,2005-08-15T15:41Z,jasa i started from beggining and its perfect! but i want to know if its possible to play with my old save in the mod. its possible? thx
,Rav10,2005-08-15T22:56Z,do u replace the spanish.gxt that u get first get with the spanish gxt in the San Andreas game folder text. or do u mean something else. 
,jasa2005,2005-08-16T17:50Z,Replace the spanish.gxt with the one in the text folder.
,jasa2005,2005-08-16T17:52Z,"I dont think you can play old saves,but I think if you start a new game then put your save in it should work!!!Also I will be posting a new mod that makes San andreas,Vice city and liberty city on the one game.And it will be on DVD5 Format not DVD9!!!"
,luczinho,2005-08-18T00:12Z,"look what i've made: i replaced the 2 files on ""data"" folder, and i replaced the spanish.gxt, but i've made the second step only 1 time. There should be that the problem for the old save can't run? thx for all your help ;)"
