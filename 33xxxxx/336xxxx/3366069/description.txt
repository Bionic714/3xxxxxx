I. INTRODUCTION
===============

You must be the new guy. I hear you?re one tough son of a bitch.  I hope 
it?s true, because we could really use the help.  Finding the right people 
for this team isn?t easy, especially with the kind of crap we?re been running 
into lately. 

Any special ops team needs to prepare for the unexpected, but with F.E.A.R., 
you?d better learn to expect the unexpected, and more importantly, believe 
the unbelievable.  You?re going to come across stuff you can?t explain, and 
you?ll need to be ready to deal with whatever it throws at you. Your own life,

as well as the lives of your teammates, will depend on it.

The information you'll get in this document will supplement and update the 
information you'll have received so far to run F.E.A.R..  If you're having a 
technical problem, look here for the most recent troubleshooting answers.

We're expecting great things from you.  Good luck!

IV. NOTES ON COMPATIBILITY
==========================

FUNCTIONALITY

F.E.A.R. is designed to function with Windows(R) 2000/XP-compatible
graphics and sound cards. Drivers for these devices are provided
by Windows(R) itself or the respective card manufacturers and may
occasionally result in compatibility problems beyond our control.

F.E.A.R. does not support Windows(R) 95, Windows(R) 98, or Windows(R) ME
since the application requires proper installation and functionality
of DirectX(R) 9.0c or higher. Microsoft does not provide or support
DirectX(R) 9.0c for these operating systems. 

If you experience any problems, it is always recommended that you
obtain the latest drivers for your hardware. Driver updates resolve
the overwhelming majority of compatibility issues. Most hardware
vendors make their drivers available on their web site.  If you are
unsure of a web site URL for a particular hardware vendor, you may
want to try accessing one of the popular Windows(R) software update
sites such as:

  http://www.windrivers.com

Additionally, a brief list of manufacturer web sites appears below
for your reference.

V.  KNOWN ISSUES
================

The following items are known issues with the current beta version of the
game.

GLOBAL:

* Users playing on Windows(R) XP Pro X64 Edition may encounter a
  "Windows Media Technologies" error during install. 

* If you notice intermediate framerate hitching when running in High detail
  setting, try turning texture resolution down to Medium.

* The Soft Shadows option will not work if Full-Screen Anti-Aliasing (FSAA)
  in enabled through the Windows Control panel. If you want to play with
  both Soft Shadows and FSAA enabled, please use the in-game FSAA Controls.

* It has been reported that the game may not uninstall from partitioned
  hard drives if installed to anything other than the "C" drive
  partition.

* Please download the latest service pack before playing. 

* If you attempt to run the game on a system with a missing or out-of-date
  version of DirectX(R) installed, then an error message will appear on
  launch that mentions "The dynamic library d3d9.dll could not be found
  in the specified path". To fix the problem, re-install the application
  and elect to install DirectX(R) 9.0c.

* Make sure that all applications that are running in the background such as
  virus scanners, desktop Utilities (menus/toolbars), media players, and
  chat programs are disabled before running F.E.A.R.

* Selecting a display resolution that is supported by your video card but
  not your monitor will result in a black screen. If this occurs, use
  ALT-F4 to quit the application, and then use the display option in the
  configuration utility (CONFIG.EXE) to select a resolution supported by
  your monitor.

* Task-switching with ALT-TAB or the Windows(R) Key back to the desktop while 
  running the game is not recommended.

* Striking the Shift key five times may cause the 'Sticky Key' feature to
  become enabled in Windows(R). If this happens, the feature will task
  switch to a desktop dialogue box with options related to this feature,
  including one to disable it entirely.


GRAPHICS:

 General: 

* Launching the game in Windows(R) XP 64-Bit Edition with ATI Radeon
Windows(R)
  64-Bit edition Beta Drivers 3 may result in a black screen on launch. To
work
  around this issue, toggle your color quality settings in Windows(R) from 32
  to 16-bit (or vice-versa) and then back again. This should allow the game to
  launch normally. 

 ATI Radeon:

* Enabling FSAA and Pixel Doubling at the same time will result in a black
screen. 
  This appears to be a driver issue. 

SOUND:

  General:

* Ambient sounds may stop playing after a certain amount of time. We are
  still looking into this. 

  If the in-game sounds and dialogue (voices) do not play, or there are
  problems with the quality of these sounds, then please try each of the
  following steps (in order) before playing again. Note that you should only
  try one solution at a time, since trying them all can greatly reduce the
  overall sound quality of the game.
 
  1. Make sure that you have the latest drivers available for your sound
     hardware installed. These can usually be found on the manufacturer's
     website. Before installing the driver, uninstall the audio device
     using the Device Manager. If possible, run a "driver cleaner"
     application to fully clean out any extra pieces of the driver and/or
     leftover files of another sound card's drivers. Do NOT allow Windows
     to install its default driver when asked. Instead, only install the
     driver you downloaded from the manufacturer's website.

  2. From your main installation folder (the default is 
     C:Program FilesSierraFEAR SP Demo), double-click on the
     file named WMFADist.exe, and then follow the on-screen instructions.
     This will manually install the audio codec that is required by the
     game. 
    
  3. From the in-game sound options menu, disable EAX and Hardware Sounds.

  Please note that since this game uses an MP3 codec for sound, 3rd party
  codec packs may cause speech and sound to drop out completely. If you have
  a codec pack installed and still have sound issues after trying all of 
  the steps listed above, then you'll need to uninstall both the codec
  pack(s) and the game and then re-install F.E.A.R.

  If 3d sounds seem to be change volume wildly (i.e. looking directly at an
  object will make it sound quieter than when it is to the side), then
  you may have your speaker configuration set up incorrectly. For instance,
  if you're listening in headphones but have the speaker configuration set
  to Surround 5.1, then a lot of sounds will be sent to speakers that don't
  exist. You can change the speaker configuration in your sound card's
  applications (such as Creative's AudioHQ or Surround Mixer) or in the
  Control Panel.
    
  If sounds that are originating in front of you sound as if they are coming
  from behind, and if these sounds seem distorted, and you are playing in
  5.1, 7.1 or any other Surround Configuration, then you may need to turn off
  CMSS in your EAX console. CMSS is used to create a multi-channel version of
  a stereo source. Unfortunately, it can cause issues like this when using it
  on sounds that are already designed to be in Surround. Note that sometimes
  you can choose not to install the EAX Console when installing your sound
  card, so you may have to reinstall the driver in order to get this
application.

  If you are using a Creative brand sound card and get poor framerates when
  sound hardware acceleration is enabled, then check for a process called
  "CtHelper"in the Windows(R) task manager. If it's there, terminate it and
  try the game again.  If this works, please contact Creative to learn
  how to permanently disable CTHelper. If CTHelper is not present in the list
  and the problem occurs anyway, then you will need to disable sound hardware
  acceleration in the Sound section of the game's options menu, or in the
  Windows control panel, or in DxDiag.


PERIPHERALS:

  Logitech MX510

  Users of this mouse may find it to be extremely sensitive in-game. Please
use
  the software supplied with your mouse to correct this issue.

  Saitek ST90

  There have been reports of problems with mapping the buttons on this 
  joystick to the fire key in the game.  

ADVANCED OPTIONS

  If you're encountering problems running the game, you can try
  tweaking some advanced settings in the configuration utility
  (config.exe). Please note that this is for advanced users only,
  since tweaking these settings could very well create other problems
  in the game.

  DISABLE SOUND
    If this box is checked, there will be no sound effects in the game.
    Also, dialogue and lip-synching will not play correctly, but music
    will still play.

    If you are experiencing problems running the game and suspect your
    sound card may be the cause, you might check this box and see if
    the problem goes away. If it does then the problem may be due to
    a problem with your sound hardware or drivers.

  DISABLE MUSIC
    If this box is checked, there will be no dynamic DirectMusic in
    the game. Please use this option for troubleshooting purposes only.

  DISABLE JOYSTICKS
    Disables input from joysticks and game pads. Certain joysticks
    and game pads may interfere with normal mouse or keyboard
    control in the game. If you suspect this is occurring, checking
    this box before running the game may resolve the problem.

  DISABLE MOVIES
    If this box is checked, the intro logo movies will not be
    shown. Use this if your system is having trouble playing these
    movies.

  DISABLE SOUND FILTERS
    If this box is checked, sound filtering effects (reverb) will be
    disabled. Only cards with EAX 2.0 support will benefit from this
    feature. If you experience problems such as static when firing a
    weapon in a particular area within a level, then you may need to
    play with sound filtering disabled. 

  DISABLE HARDWARE SOUND
    If this box is checked, this will disable DirectSound 3D sound support
    and could cause performance issues.

  RESTORE DEFAULTS
    If this box is checked, all in-game options will be restored to the
    default values. This can be useful if a particular option setting
    is preventing you from restoring the defaults from the menu system.  


VI. PERFORMANCE
================

DETAIL SETTINGS and DISPLAY RESOLUTION

  In order to get the best game play experience, it is not recommended to
  run F.E.A.R. at high resolutions. You should avoid resolutions above
  1024x768 on any current generation card. Instead, you can use the
  full-screen anti-aliasing (FSAA) option under Graphics in the advanced
  options menu. This helps improve the visual quality of the final scene
  without dramatically increasing the amount of work that must be performed.

  Most players will also notice a significant increase in frame rate by
  disabling the Vsync option in the display options screen. If this doesn?t
  make enough of a difference, your next step should be to lower your
  screen resolution to 800x600 or 640x480. 

  If performance is still a problem at this stage, try these additional
  steps:

  ? Disable FSAA and Soft Shadows in the advanced options under Graphics.
  ? Use Trilinear Texture Filtering instead of Anisotropic.

  If your system does not meet the requirements as listed at the top
  of this document, you may still be able to play with reasonable
  performance by following these steps:

  ? If your video card doesn't meet the requirements, enable Pixel Doubling.
  ? If you are using a GeForce(TM)FX card, set ?Force DX8 Shaders? to on.
  ? If you have less than 512MB of RAM or a video card with less than
    128MB of RAM, use low or medium Texture Resolution. 

UPGRADING

  If you are dissatisfied with the level of detail that your system can
  handle, then you may wish to consider upgrading. F.E.A.R.'s
  performance is most affected by your video card, followed closely by the
  CPU speed and the amount of installed memory in your machine. A high end
  video card and CPU will usually result in considerable frame rate
  improvements, while installing more RAM will result in shorter load times
  and less hitching during game play.
