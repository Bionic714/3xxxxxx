,Mercuis,2005-08-06T19:07Z,Thank you. But dev-tbfb.r02 is missing on cd2- :(
,PhakeDC,2005-08-08T01:18Z,I am Bosnian I think this game is pretty good but I hate the fact you can only play one side.
,PhakeDC,2005-08-12T00:08Z,Come to think of it the graphics are really poor and what the hell's wrong with those stiff soldier models? One for diehard tank sim fans only.
,gadflyofathens,2008-04-28T10:14Z,PLEASE SEED!  I love tank games.  This looks fantastic.
,mythmore,2011-05-18T15:03Z,"Does this game works? Any info? WTF????
I have this game but my Second CD is fucked up so anyone tested this shit yet?"
,mythmore,2011-05-18T15:06Z,"Well,This is nothing but a bullshit... If you want the game go to:

And Please SEED after downloading.

Ave The Pirate Bay!"
