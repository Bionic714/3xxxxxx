Release Notes:

Simon Franks and Tom Dinsdale's follow their eponymous debut album 'Ego War'
with the highly anticipated 'Generation'. Taking in everything from ska to UK
garage, this is house music with the easy laddish charm of Squeeze or Madness
combined with sub-bass beats that tell ask you to do more than just raise your
hands.

As the intro suggests, the dynamic duo are 'taking a new direction' with this
album as they kick things off with the raucous energy and streetwise swagger of
'Shot You Down', taking Nancy Sinatra's original from the 'Kill Bill' soundtrack
and using its fearsome atmosphere, to play host to one of their most unashamedly
dancefloor friendly cuts to date. Laden with wobbly basslines and dropping down
to the barest of vocals it has tension, it has outright abandon, and it is
undoubtedly one of the finest-crafted bootlegs to have emerged in the past few
years.

'Bring Light' samples the Whispers 'And The Beat Goes On' to provide a jump up
club classic, the title track is reminiscent of the old skool rave scene with
gritty basslines while 'I Won't Let You Down' has a thumping hook that just
doesn√Üt quit, a common trait of a classic Bullys anthem. 'Eq-ing' rips a leaf
out of the Prodigy rule book while nabbing one of the Chemical Brothers synths
as the beats and distorted vocals warp into a massive main set anthem. Rooty
Toot Manuva makes a guest appearance on the hip hop tinged 'Made Like That'
while 'This Road' features the Madness of Suggs.

The Audio Bullys are most definitely taking about their 'Generation' as the
album shows a young band that blends the amphetamine dynamism of The Who with
the wry social comment of The Kinks, but still wraps it up in the
ribcage-bending thump of UK club culture.
