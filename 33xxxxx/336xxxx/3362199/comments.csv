Just use prog that can edit photos and take any pic, crop it, and then resize it to be 160x120 pixels then save it as a jpg.  Then rename the .jpg to .THM and make the file name match the movie file and you are all set.  "
,Pikachuy,2008-06-25T13:42Z,"I usually use 'paint' to create thumbnails. Make sure its named the same as the video file. Exept for the .THM file.

Like this:

The video:  Alien.mp4
Thumbnail:  Alien.THM"
