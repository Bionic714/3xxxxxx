Formatted for your PSP or other mobile gadget that handles MP4 format.  Included is a custom Alien wallpaper for your PSP and a matching custom thumbnail.

Connect your PSP with PC, and copy the two files with the name M4V96672 (the large on is the move file and the smaller one is the thumbnail.  Both are needed for your PSP to play it) into "H:MP_ROOT100MNV01" (where "H" is the drive letter of your PSP)


Plot:
When commercial towing vehicle Nostromo, heading back to Earth, intercepts an SoS signal from a nearby planet, the crew are under obligation to investigate. After a bad landing on the planet, some crew members leave the ship to explore the area. At the same time as they discover a hive colony of some unknown creature, the ship's computer deciphers the message to be a warning, not a call for help. When one of the eggs is disturbed, the crew do not know the danger they are in until it is too late.
