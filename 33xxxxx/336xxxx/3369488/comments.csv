,zodiaq,2005-08-13T23:54Z,Thanks alot! :D
,mGoLos,2005-08-14T09:12Z,"Thanks. Be careful, trip safe and with friends in a well-known, relaxing area where you've placed flowers, fruits and pictures with many colours. Don't be stupid and do a ""heroic"" dose, they are not heroic, they are simply stupid and your friends will consider you a liability that they must watch carefully all night long."

,gawd,2006-02-25T20:50Z,Underbart ! kolla in på magiskamolekyler.org eller erowid.org om ni vill njuta av lite läsning & tips. Överdosera er INTE ! 
,soupbone666,2008-12-03T00:39Z,"I strongly disagree with mGoLos.  For those who dont know, Terrence Mckenna called a dose of 5 dry grams the ""Heroic Dose"".  I like to trip AT LEAST 5 dry grams.  If you are not yet very experienced with hallucinogens I would suggest a first time dose of AT LEAST a half ounce.  This will insure that your trip will be a powerful and life changeing experience.  One thing I like to do while tripping is to lay down on the center line of a busy interstate or freeway while cars whizz past me at alarming speeds.  It will freak your mind! "
