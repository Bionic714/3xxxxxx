1984 Cocteau Records 7 73377-2
 The "black box" era, November 22, 2003 
Reviewer: Anthony D Ravenscroft from Santa Fe, NM United States  
If you're big on atmospherics & ambient, you will probably like this CD. If you like Nelson's rock, you're at the opposite side of the auditorium.

All of 44:25, it's one of those "endless introductions" albums -- which is, of course, perfect for interpolative & background music that's not really meant to be examined closely.

Most enjoyable track: 5. Listening to lizards. A little electro that predates the style by more than a decade.
