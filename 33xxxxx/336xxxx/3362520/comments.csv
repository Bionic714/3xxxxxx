,musmatta,2005-07-30T13:21Z,"please all that have downloaded the game, download the torrent again and keep seeding it. "
,Multo_Destructo,2005-07-31T22:02Z,Ă&#x201E;r det hĂ¤r hela spelet eller bara demot?
,IcySon55,2005-08-02T04:38Z,"This game is Full Version, KeyGen included. Have Fun!"
,microwiz,2005-08-11T10:52Z,"Need seeders!  Someone, please..."
,yowza,2006-04-09T10:03Z,Could someone seed a little more?
,KarlosTheJAKAL,2006-09-13T22:57Z,"Not working copy, this is DEMO
Use the original torrent and try to seed that more:

,IcySon55,2006-12-06T20:15Z,"Who here has got my copy of the torrent working and thinks KarlosTheJAKAL is full of bullshit?

I have personally tried the game before submitting it to TPB and it does indeed work. My torrent was just a copy of premier69's. I finished his broken files using eMule, and then put it up here.

It's obvious my torrent works because it's still being seeded after a year and five months."
,KarlosTheJAKAL,2006-12-13T13:56Z,"Well, if it works for you then fair enough. This one did not work for me, but the other did.

In any case, this is the only one you can get these days.


Oh, and you are a cocksucking cunt with a small dick.

:)"
,IcySon55,2006-12-21T18:06Z,"Wow, that the most pointless comment ever. First of all, it's not my fault it doesn't work for you. Second, there's no way you could possibly know anything about me.

Plus, calling people names online doesn't get you anywhere. Does it make you feel better insulting strangers online? I pity you."
,KarlosTheJAKAL,2007-01-09T17:48Z,"Actually, I know everything about you - we met at that party you had in your house. In fact, I'm there now...

It was then that I realised you had such a small dick, and were in fact, a cocksucking cunt.

Other people at the party back me up on this. "
,SwordOfZork,2007-01-21T19:54Z,"Wow, way to be mature there JAKAL...

Seriously, to anyone who wants to torrent Starscape:

DON'T BOTHER

I'm trying to post this on all the torrents I can find of it.  The demo is the same file as the full version.  You just need a keygen to unlock it.  Download the game from moonpod's website:
http://www.moonpod.com/English/about_ss.php
Then download a keygen for it (v1.5c):

,KarlosTheJAKAL,2007-04-12T22:17Z,"Hey SwordOfZork - thanks for pointing out that I'm mature. That's because of my big man dick. I feel sorry for you and IcySon55 with your tiny boy cocks. Honestly, I can take you both at the same time and it's like waving two chips around in a bucket. Come back when you've grown up a bit and I'll show you a good time. "
,Dontar,2008-01-20T14:36Z,"JAKAL I don't know you, but your comments have been the most immature I have yet to see on the internet, and I am an avid gamer so i have seen a lot of immaturity.

and to whom it may concern, I have just downloaded it, and will continue to seed for as long as I see peers downloading."
,bizzybody,2010-05-02T00:30Z,Did anyone ever do a God Mode trainer hack for Starscape 1.5c like the one there is for version 1.4e?
,sjkcm2,2011-04-01T00:28Z,"hey heres a real noob question is a malwere-gen like the keygen of you starscape torrent?
