WARLORDS (New Series) Channel 4 Sundays 31 July, 7, 14, 21 August 2005 8pm Episode 2 CHURCHILL v ROOSEVELT An examination of the mental battles waged between 20th-century leaders Winston Churchill and Franklin D Roosevelt during the first two years of their relationship. A duel of false promises, evasion and delusion ensued, which was far removed from the more familiar image of friendship and loyalty. World War II was not only a military conflict. It was also a series of private psychological battles waged by the four great leaders: Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill. In these mental duels, the 'warlords' lied, schemed, charmed, flattered and cheated to win. http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/t-z/warlords.html
