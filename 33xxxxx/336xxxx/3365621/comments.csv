,cevar,2008-05-28T07:29Z,"hi

i have downloaded this torrent and burned it using nero 7, but when i test the cd, i am always receiving the message ""disk boot failure"" can someone help me? is this really the bootable copy of erd 2005?

thank you

,locutus3,2008-07-07T02:14Z,"Much obliged. Unpacked fine, ISO burned with no problems and the program worked fine. Burned it using PowerISO 3.8. Used it to reset the administrator password that I had stupidly forgotten. A lifesaver. Thanks."
,TheSlamer,2009-01-21T18:24Z,Is this the PRO hacking program to windows?
,rocketero,2010-02-08T23:23Z,"To anyone using erd commander I find out that this is a great software, but compared to the Windows-PE-builder software (called Winbuilder) is not that great after all.

I just built a Windows7 PE (Boot-able Windows 7 with Many Tools) using Winbuilder-078-SP6, just google it and you'll see what this is.

You can have this bootable cd (after building it takes around 350 to 400 MB space), with network support and tools like disk imaging, antivirus, antispyware, Internet, and much more.

Just take a look at screenshot I took:

as this is a CD, you can make as many changes while working with it and once is shutdown no changes are made to your apps or tools.

Hope this helps, Winbuilder has a forum with many users eager to help you.

they have builds for LiveXP, VistaPE, Win7PE, BartPE and a few others.

,blombardo,2010-07-05T23:20Z,I have used this cd over 100 times in the past few years. It is invaluable for many reasons.  The only other solution that works almost as good would be a custom linux boot cd with various tools - this ERD commander boots you into a more 'windows' looking environment and allows you to do so much...
