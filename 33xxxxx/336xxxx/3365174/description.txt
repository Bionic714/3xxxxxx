The 4400 Season 2
--------------------------------
1(6). Wake-Up Call
--------------------------------
It's been one year since the 4400 returned. After a period of 
intense medical observation, Tom has returned to NTAC in a limited 
capacity, assigned only to desk duty. Diana, having been through a 
series of inept partners, finally finds a way to cut through the red 
tape and get Tom back, all while in the midst of formally adopting 
Maia. Meanwhile, Richard, Lily and the baby are still living in 
meager conditions in a mountain cabin far away from Jordan. Jordan 
has now closed Arcadia Estates, and is on the verge of opening "The 
4400 Centers," a place for non-members of the 4400 to discover "the 
4400 within themselves." Collier becomes Shawn's guardian, and 
enlists him to heal important benefactors of the Centers.

2(7). Voices Carry
The NTAC manipulates a thought-reading baseball player to spy on 
Jordan Collier. Diana's younger sister visits. Richard and Lily's 
daughter's growing powers hinder their life on the lam.
