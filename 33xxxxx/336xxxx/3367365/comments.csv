,Gorgoroth666,2005-08-18T06:27Z,"I need help... Using Nero and winrar I burned CD's 1 and 2 but 3 and 4 won't burn... I changed the .cue file and everything, I noticed in windows xp though it won't read the file as dev-br2-c.bin it leaves off the file extension... Anyone know if the file extension is causing havoc? If so, any other reliable (hopefully free) programs that will handle this properly?"
