La Jetée (1962)
Directed and written by: Chris Marker

Genre: Sci-Fi / Short

Plot Summary: Earth lies ruined in the aftermath of a nuclear war. The few surviving humans begin researching time travel, in hopes of sending someone back to the pre-war world in search of food, supplies, and hopefully some sort of solution to mankind's imminent demise.

Info: 'La Jetée' is comprised entirely of still shot photography (except one barely noticable scene where you can see the character blink and slightly move). 'La Jetée' inspired and influenced Terry Gilliam to make the movie "12 monkeys".
