,Kanshira,2005-07-28T23:58Z,Det är ju bara att inse att denna release är fucked up. Det var synd. Hade sett fram emot att spela. Tråkigt att man satt ett dygn av förväntning bara.
,bobboviking,2005-07-29T00:47Z,nej e inget fel på denna funkar kanon för mej... dubbel klicka  bara på den sista rar filen istället för den första så packar d upp  sej jätte fint 
,Kanshira,2005-07-29T01:33Z,"När jag packar upp den sista rar filen så går det bra fram till 1 %, då kommer det upp en text som säger You need to have the following volume to continue extraction: Gran_Turismo_4_PAL_PS2DVD5-JiMjim-gt4dvd6.rar och det finns ingen fil som heter så. Vad gör jag för fel?"
[T],songojk,2005-07-29T06:51Z,i don't have this file jim-gt4dvd6.rar hmm rename to jim-gt4dvd5.rar and maybe work fine

,Kanshira,2005-07-29T11:29Z,"Ok, now I got winrar to pack the files up finally. It was a little bit tricky. The rar files are not in order so when it says DVD6 it means actually rar-file 6 and I browsed for this and the in was a smooth continue. Thanx songojk for your exlplanation and a good upload. Haven´t test the game though."
,Kanshira,2005-07-29T11:55Z,"Ok! I was wrong. After 99 % the extraction stops and says that the file is corrupt. I don´t get it. I know how to use winrar and I have never had a problem using it with other games.
The wierdest thing is that it´s totally 31 winrar arhive files within this release but when extracted 99 % I was only at the 15:th winrar arhive file, shouldn´t it be like the last? This i a fucking mystery I can´t solve."

[V],kaxig_idiot,2006-10-29T11:35Z,jävla skit spel! funkar inte!!!
,kazuyabo,2006-12-17T00:22Z,"To all people having unpacking this rar.

1. view it with details
2. and go to the last wirrar icon
3. then unpack it.

thnx to SkyRyder....."
,latino77,2007-03-17T17:56Z,Funkar perfekt som Aritist skrev. skapa en textdokument i gt4 mappen där rar-filerna ligger genom att höger klicka och ta nytt textdokument sen klistrar du in Aritist rename på den tomma textdokumentet och sparar som rename.bat. stäng ner filen och dubbelklicka på den så kommer den att ändra namn på alla rar-filerna. sen är det bara att packa upp som vanligt med winrar...funkade utmärkt för mig iaf. Thanks Aritist and songojk!!!
