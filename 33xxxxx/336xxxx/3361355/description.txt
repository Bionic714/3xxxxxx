  of a nerve-rattling conspiracy. After the Joker plummets to his death
  in an attempt to kill Batman, Gotham´s criminals quickly escalate
  their schemes to gain power. Batman discovers subtle links in these
  seemingly unrelated crimes, but is forced undercover after being
  framed for an attack on Commissioner Gordon. Hunted by the police,
  the Dark Knight must pinpoint the unseen enemy weaving this sinister
  web - before Gotham City falls to a fiery demise.

  We tested this game on a developer XBOX, and it works.  Since there is
  no mod chip yet, we have no idea if this release will work on retail
  XBOXes when/if a mod comes out.  However, now that there is a release,
  a modchip developer will be inclined to get our releases to work, so
  we think a future mod will work with this release.

  If a game is small enough to be burned to a CD, you can burn it to 
  either a CD or DVD, at your option, using the same ISO file.  
  The Xbox does not use media checks like the PS2. 

  When burning to a CD, if your CD burning program has an option, 
  choose "MODE1/2048", exactly as if you were burning a PC CD-ROM.
  We recommend PrimoDVD for burning Xbox for both CD and DVD, but 
  all CD writing software besides Clone CD should work fine.

  From our experience, the retail Xbox can only read DVD-RW's
  and CD-RW's, so if you want to be sure that these will work
  with a future mod, we recommend burning them to Rewritable
  discs. We have heard reports of the retail Xbox reading some
  types of DVD-R discs, but we have been unable to verify this.
