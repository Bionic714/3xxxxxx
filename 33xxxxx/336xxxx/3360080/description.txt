Nerve Gas Tragedy was formed in April of 2004 by
the four remaining members of All Out War
following vocalist Mike Score's departure.
Instead of trying to replace Score, the guys
decided to start over, putting an end to All Out
War's 12 year run. Then along came frontman Will
Kummerer, a good friend of the band as well as a
local hardcore legend, and Nerve Gas Tragedy was
born. Nerve Gas Tragedy combines the sounds of
1980's thrash and heavy metal (such as Megadeth,
Slayer, Anthrax, and Kreator) with 1990's
hardcore. (suck as Madball, Blood For Blood,
Hatebreed and Merauder).
