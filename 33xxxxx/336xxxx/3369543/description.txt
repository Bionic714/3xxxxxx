iPod shuffle Database Builder
=============================

This release contains multiple versions of the program:
  rebuild_db.py     - a Python script for almost any platform (RECOMMENDED)
  rebuild_db.exe    - a standalone Win32 console application (DEPRECATED)

Please use the Python version, because it is the only one that is actively
developed, and it has a lot more features compared to the Win32 version.

To use the Database Builder, copy rebuild_db.py to your iPod's root directory
and start it, e.g. with a double click in Explorer or Finder.

Additionally, this archive contains rebuild_db-win32.src.zip, which is an
archive of the C source code for the Win32 version (compile with lcc-win32).
