,jorlando,2005-08-14T20:48Z,ugh....resampling your music to 128k? no thank you.....just get the ml_ipod plugin for winamp.....works better than anything out there..
,cupique,2006-09-26T13:33Z,iTunes only resample your music to 128K if you want to. It's an option for those who wants to cram more songs to it.
