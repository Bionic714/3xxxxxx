,hockeyhead,2008-08-30T08:15Z,PLEASE SEED!!!! I would really like to have this and it will take me so long to download it with so few seeds...
,hockeyhead,2008-09-14T06:33Z,Ill seed this forever if I could just get past 89.1... please seed and stop leeching.
,midvalley9,2008-10-02T05:05Z,"WTF?  When I play it, it plays with both the Japanese and English audio.  I can't get it to play just one!"
,x3r0kool,2009-01-05T08:54Z,"jeez people, it HAS both japanese and english audio tracks, you need to use your media splitter (if you don't know, then don't bother) and midvalley, your codecs are corrupted.  Download a new version of whatever media player you like (I prefer k-lite from filehippo.com) and istall it.  now, if that's all said and done, I'd like to partake in the tonado of data"
,jpafaa,2009-02-14T22:10Z,sorry i never encounted this before and do not know how to change the japenese audio to english? can anyone help me with this? i'm using VLC. Thanks.
,Nohg,2009-02-19T21:27Z,"In VLC go to the Audio menu -----> Audio Track-----> (Track 1 or Track 2).

Test it, find the English (I assume Track 2) and just make sure to do that whenever you open an episode."
,humpledink_tobias,2009-02-22T03:55Z,lol man some people have no idea how to use VLC NOOBS
,kochanneo,2009-04-08T14:20Z,Picture quality is pretty good considering its age.
,SkavenSlurpy,2009-06-14T07:45Z,i would appreciate it if more people would seed this...only getting about 3 kb per second...ill definetly seed this forever
,lostinlodos,2009-08-28T03:14Z,tvirus457: Thanks for telling us it's a superior format with ORIGINAL language and not that dub crap nonsense for losers who should be beaten and tortured for enjoying BUTCHERED dub-crap
,Moogly3090,2009-09-07T09:53Z,"Downloading these atm, for anyone who needs a good video player I suggest Gom Player (windows only) and VLC (I think?) for all platforms! :3"
,OncomingTraffic,2010-11-19T15:24Z,"I strongly recommend VLC actually. And this is a Dual Audio torrent. I'm not sure if all video players allow this (VLC does), but you can change the Audio/Subtitle tracks while watching."
,alonewestand,2012-06-11T22:02Z,A whole 2 seeders oh boy.  Can someone possibly just host the audio tracks?
,andrewmyles,2012-07-26T17:08Z,seeeed. Or at least use the other 7.75 G torrent with (i think) exactly the same files
,buttslaya117,2012-08-04T11:51Z,"Quality is great. Japanese & English audio tracks + English subtitles (use MPC and you can select what audio track you want). I'll be seeding for a while.

Oh and Gundam Wing is fucking awesome."
,buttslaya117,2012-08-10T02:30Z,"EDIT: Watch with Japanese + Eng subtitles. The English dub is SO lame compared to it. This is my third time watching the series, first with Japanese audio, and it is so much better. The emotional inflection is so much better than on the cheesy english dub. Trust me.

Also, Lady Une is a cunt."
