,tortus,2005-08-12T08:03Z,There is no problem with this - - - - the problem is with you....  You will commonly find this nuisance almost everywhere.  There is no need to flag it - as your brain should do that automatically.  SIMPLY USE A G*O*O*D ANTIVIRUSer (eg Kaspersky).  Or - and in this instance - SIMPLY open the archive and manually delete - START.EXE.... All fixed and green for GO..... If these were all flagged for your benifit then the many would be missing out - unnecessarily.  Sometimes - START.EXE - may be the real thing - but only in about ~0.001% of cases.  If you are able to run this type of EXEcutable - then your security (and the system) IS already DEAD - or as good as - and guess who is to blame ????
