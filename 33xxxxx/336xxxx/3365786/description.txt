Ok, first of all - I am not taking credit for any of the videos in this release.

---------------------------------
This is the DVD-9 version (double layered DVD) of the infamous Iron Maiden concert at Ullevi Stadium, the 9:th of July 2005. I got my hands on a really nice looking, good sounding widescreen video of this spectacular show (file size was around 6gb) and decided to do something special with it. I have spent a couple of days fiddling around with with DVD-lab, creating really cool audio menus along with some slideshows and news paper reviews of the show. I am quite satisfied. I hope ya'll like it!

And yes, the video has been left untouched (no compression or nothing).
