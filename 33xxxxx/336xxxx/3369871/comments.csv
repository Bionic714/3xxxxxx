,Kamigawa,2006-01-08T00:21Z,"Alright, i joined and got a Username and password, but how do i get the cd key?"
,~LuMb3R~,2006-01-08T17:47Z,Only tip is... use WinRAR... (WinZip/Winace etc) sometimes claim files have a password even tho they dont... besides that.. just follow the nfo file.. smooth sailing.
,~LuMb3R~,2006-01-08T17:53Z,"Ohh and this is a great upload... grafic novel with some interaction... great story (Tho I've only ""played"" 1 of the 5 tree's so far) But makes me wanna go back in time and wish for a crazy first girlfriend like Yuki RL. Just wondering if theres any other ""games""/novels like this out there."

,omegashrn,2007-06-19T23:41Z,"I don't know what you guy's are going wrong, but after you install it. Put the nfo in the vmate launch
directory, and the crack in the program directory. GGD i used to get that error, you have to mount the  images with alcohol or something like that."
,Cymorph,2007-07-15T03:00Z,"Yes, ofcourse guys! Mount the /Hitomi - My Stepsister cd 1.mdf -- /Hitomi - My Stepsister cd 2.mdf -- with Daemon Tools or Alcohol to install this game!"
,demongodcrush,2007-10-16T18:25Z,I've mounted the files with Alcohol 120% and put the nfo in the vmate launch directory and I put the crack in the program directory. Only problem is that vmate still wants a password and i'm still getting the GGD error. What do I do?
,darkzeratul241,2007-11-19T19:19Z,"You dont just put the file,. overwrite it , if this happens then you'll be fine.. NFO is for reading."
,Shenkman505,2008-02-03T03:34Z,Can you use bitorrent to mount the .mdf files??
,mark.taiwan,2008-05-10T20:38Z,"wow, all i have to say is that if you are lucky, the ""good ending"" is really good. but some of the other endings are simply plain fucked up...."
,JRendrag,2008-07-18T22:36Z,HALP!! I try to install the game and it goes all the way to 99% but then it tells me to insert the game disc and I keep trying but for some reason it won't go.  What do I do?
,Shadowhand1,2008-08-22T05:03Z,"Hey Im new to the whole torrent thing so i could use some help or at lest some tips lol thanks, btw when i install this it says ""Please insert the ""Game"" Disk, then hit ok""  ^^;;"

,TroKing,2008-10-28T13:30Z,omfg thank you so much for this
,Insurgent84,2009-01-17T18:48Z,"Alright... Here is a simple solution for all you technologically backward people (like me).

Download as normal.

Mount the MDF Image with DaemonTools. 

Install via the prompts.

When It says ""Insert CD"", Create a new folder on your desktop and copy ALL the files from your mounted file into the new folder.

replace the normal "".exe"" with the cracked one that came with the download, and run it!

Works like a charm. Great game, and a quality download."
,traveling_east,2009-02-15T23:01Z,Thanks :)
[T],Hgames,2009-03-02T06:52Z,":rolleyes: All you have to do is install the game by loading cd1 and then mount cd2 which is the game disk and copy the ""Contents"" of the rar file to the ""Game"" Folder and play the game. You don't need to extract anything from the image file ROFL. 

Here is a English nfo if you need the install instructions.

,ninjas3,2009-04-09T03:16Z,"how do you overwrite the exe

and i know this sounds stupid
but when you open the NFO for the cracked exe, where is it? 
i don't know where the exe is written on it"
,ninjas3,2009-04-09T07:40Z,"what does it mean when it says
'can't use the connected file GGD'
when i try to open the HITOMIML.exe"

,TPBrox,2009-10-21T06:06Z,"alright here are step-by-step instructions which i hope might be useful to beginners with downloading torrents too. 

NOTE : this is a method i used & i have WINDOWS XP.

NOTE : you need the programmes ""UTorrent"" ""WinRAR"" & ""Daemon Tools"" for this method.

1.download this torrent

2.go to the location where this torrent has been downloaded & open it with UTorrent

3.UTorrent will open & another box will appear on the screen with all the file's details & what all files are inside it. Select all of the files and click ok.

4.downloading of the file in its actual size will start. After the downloading is finished go to the location where the new file is stored.

5.open the file. You will find 6 things inside it :-
a) cd1.mdf
b) cd1.mds 
c) cd2.mdf
d) cd2.mds
e) Vmate Crack Made By Pahn.rar
f) pahn-hms.info (i dont know wat this is for either)

6.open cd1.mdf using Daemon Tools & start installing the game

7.when prompted to insert the second disk just open cd2.mdf using Daemon Tools again

8.while the installation is going on extract the files inside Vmate Crack Made By Pahn.rar using WinRAR

9.just extract the file HITOMIML.exe

10.now after installation completes go to the location where the new folder of this game is. Like for me the new folder got saved in c://program files under the name of ""MERCURE"".

11.open the file. for me there was another file inside it with the name HITOMIML. i opened it. Inside the folder you will find HITOMIML. now just replace this with the HITOMIML you extracted using WinRAR & u can do this by  the cut & paste method or the drag & drop method.

12.enjoy the game ^_^

i hope this would be useful for everyone. i know it was a very long & boring explanation. please dont get angry at me :( "
