,DonHagenbuch,2006-04-24T09:27Z,"As I wrote I am stuck at 99.9%. But the ISO file can be mounted (on Mac) and plays (though I have not viewed the whole movie).
I had this movie already as a VCD and while the flights are impressive as usual in this aerea, the explanations by CPT or FO should have been more.

[T],skJGZV6z,2009-03-21T05:59Z,"A technical snafu appears to have everyone stuck at 99%, however, the result was perfectly playable for me. I've noticed this can happen if the torrent gets down to a single seed, which then touches the files and causes a file date to update or similar. The file's different now, so hashfails ensue, even if the important content is unmolested.

Anyway, I enjoyed this DVD. A nice outing with the 733. Good paired with the Wideroe DVD for service in Norway. Flightcrews were less chatty than on the best of these DVDs, and the banter tends to be in Norwegian and so is obscure to English-only viewers (yeah, we suck). However, this didn't detract from the fun of observing the operations.

(Audio is generally poor on all the W.A.R. series DVDs. You get radio interphone audio positively blasting your ears off, along with certain cockpit annunciators, but then flight crew voices are weak, sometimes patched via interphone, othertimes via poor open-air mic (camera mounted?). Suggestion: feel-out the flight crews on wearing lavalier mics and hooked to a proper soundman's rig. It's more work and perhaps more cumbersome, but certainly doable with a low obtrusiveness for a pro filmcrew, and would yield an infinitely more enjoyable final product."
,galluco,2010-05-04T07:44Z,"Is there any good soul who has this DVD 100% and could be a seeder for me and other enthusiasts stuck in 99,9% to complete this download?
It lasts only 0,01% - Not fair!
Please seed!!!! For a week at least.
Thanks..."
