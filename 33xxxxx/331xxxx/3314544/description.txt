What is Gnarkill?.

Gnarkill is Brandon DiCamillo, Bam Margera, and Jess Margera. They recorded a few tracks in the Margera’s basement as a joke, and eventually released it as a vinyl. Gnarkill features Bran freestyling over drum tracks laid down by Jess and keyboards by Bam. After a storm caused the ckystore.com office’s ceiling to cave in, the vinyls were all but destroyed, prompting the release of an enhanced CD. Because of this, the vinyls are extremely rare and highly sought after. In Bam’s movie Haggard, CKY plays the role of Gnarkill, Hellboy’s favorite band

Brandon DiCamillo and Bam Margera is known from Jackass, CKY and Viva La Bam, and Jess is the singer and gittarist in the band CKY a.k.a Camp Kill Yourself
