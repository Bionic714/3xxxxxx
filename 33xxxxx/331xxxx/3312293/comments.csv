,BBBScorpio,2005-04-09T00:43Z,Anyone else got any graphic problems??
,El_Zorro,2005-04-14T15:20Z,"Works fine for me, at least to start a game... play alittle, maybe some more.. then it just crash all of a sudden. Any hints what could cause this?"
,svartberg,2005-04-17T17:57Z,"Game ROX m/
* ye game has quite a few bugs, make sure to save a lot.
* a lot of things will look like bugs until you learn how they work (not getting master upgrades, citizen certificate not showing, etc) a manual rip would help ^^"
,Strict,2005-04-22T22:02Z,"It crashes a lot?  Never crashed once for me.....so that's kinda weird....did you crack it or not?

Can't remember now....but isn't there an update in it? If so: did you update it?"
,svartberg,2005-04-24T12:00Z,"personally, it's not the crashes that annoyed me (only had 1 maybe 2), it's the bugs - the most noticable one now is the master grade bug, it worked fine first game, but no wether i do a master grade upgrade (from the painting) it upgrades it after an hour, and then it automatically tries to upgrade it again and gets stuck infintly (sucks big time)

guess my game is unplayable now *sob* *sob"
,Strict,2005-04-29T05:20Z,"That's never ever happened to me, I've never had any problems at all with this game acctually (except when playing multiplayer =)"
,Strict,2005-05-01T05:47Z,To those that asked: No it's not the games fault I had a problem in Multiplayer but our (me and my friend) comps hate each other =)

,stoffesver,2005-05-04T08:41Z,"i´ve had crashes! MANY! and only when i played for a while...

,Strict,2005-05-04T14:08Z,Svartberg: Du tror inte det hjälper om du ominstallerar då =)

,CanDariaN,2006-05-03T06:41Z,I think JoWood has discontinued their forum on EU1400 but I cant wait for the sequel :D which is in the works
,Strict,2006-05-06T07:54Z,"Hey...where did you hear about a sequel?

I know of a guy that even sent the ""owner"" of that company an E-mail asking for a sequel...and he said that there wouldn't be one....maybe they changed their minds then...good =)"
,DeCrazyOne,2006-06-24T21:13Z,I just downloaded this game but i dont kno how to use it would someone pls tell me how to play it as i love the game but could not get the expansion
,anemos_breeze,2006-06-25T20:12Z,Can somebody please help me? I just downloaded it and there's three files and I do not know what to do to install it ...What must I do in order to call out Installwizard or something...
,Calade,2006-06-30T16:13Z,More seeders please! Very slow with only 1 seeding.
,Calade,2006-06-30T16:15Z,"And for your problem, Anemos: Download a program called Alcohol 120%. Those files are usually on CD. This program tells the computer that they actually would be on a CD and makes a fake CD drive. It's easy to use."
,Calade,2006-07-01T00:02Z,"Now I need the help. Where can I find a crack for this? Every crack I found was for the normal version or the expansion, not the gold version."
,JupsiK,2006-08-16T09:22Z,"Need more seeders, plz... =)"

,lillmicke99,2007-05-09T11:22Z,"Do'h! I'm stuck at 93.5% and I think that another guy is very close to that since I'm uploading 5-10kbit/s to him.

Would appreciate if someone would take the responsibility to seed this game.

Many thanks, Lillmicke99"
,Rottweiler_sweden,2007-06-08T15:23Z,Damn that was indeed a nice game
,drakinn,2007-12-31T07:29Z,"how do i unpack these files, i have it all download, but it dont unpack like normal games i do, someone help me, and also, the bugs, those actually happened with the real game from disc, and it does vary from comp to comp, i dunno if any updates or patches where ever made, if someone finds them please let me know"
,gwwar,2008-02-25T09:06Z,"seed please

Thanks"
,TheFrontier,2008-03-24T03:07Z,"Hello and thanks Strict! It lagged a bit at +90% but I got it now and it works perfect I seeded around 4 GB so I hope thats enough.

Anyone with the No CD problem: 
1. Download PowerIso, Install.
2. Open the file with poweriso.
3. Open the file called Deviance.
4. There is two files in there. One is for the main game. Right click the game icon and press properties go to find target and paste the Crack into the program files it will ask to replace say yes.
5. Do the same for the expansion.
I hope I helped.

Thanks again Strict!

P.S. If you liked this game try The Guild 2 same people who made thisg ame same concept!"
