,wakebreak,2005-04-06T12:18Z,Sweet! really appriciate it! Does anyone have any Brian Tracy audio or dvd? Or know where I might find some? He is another master in this area. 
,ingen_aning,2005-04-06T15:02Z,"Jag tror inte man ska ta den här snubben alltför allvarligt. Hans ""psykologi"" (NLP) är inte accepterat av varken amerikanska psykologiförbundet eller några neurologer. NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) grundades av en matematiker (Bandler) och en datanörd som trodde att de kommit på hur man kan omprogramera om hjärnan, dvs skriva om hjärnans ""software"". Bandler själv hade en massa drogproblem samt blev åtalad för mord.

NLP är New Age flummeri som lånar hej vilt från alla möjliga, geggar ihop sörjan med lite snömos och försöker få desperata människor att svälja skiten. Och visst, det kan säkert funka  som sockerpiller. Men om ni är ute efter placebo-effekt så har jag en stortå som ni kan få suga på: den smakar säkert fan men den är ganska snygg. Jag kan skrapa av lite löst skinn och skicka hem det er  för bara 50000kr grammet (Anthony ""Lill-Jesus"" Robbins tjänar grova pengar på sin dynga). "
,deep4t,2005-04-06T23:39Z,"Can you leave your comments in English please?

the rest of us non-scandinavian readers would like to know your thoughts and would appreciate a translation

then we can have a meanful discussion :-)

thanks in advance"
,wakebreak,2005-04-07T11:18Z,"Wierd, I did search for brian Tracu, but didn't find anything. I'll try to look manually trough the list. Thx for the advise."
,wakebreak,2005-04-07T11:32Z,"I looked through the entire list, didn't find any brian tracy, could you provide the link. Would realy appriciate it."
,cl0wn,2005-04-08T07:09Z,"jag tror ingen_aning har precis det ;-)
sen så om man uttalar sig kan man ju se till att få dit korrekt information också, men det är ju bara min mening."
,ingen_aning,2005-04-08T11:06Z,"Du kanske kan informera om vad som är felaktig information? Och visst: jag har ""ingen aning"" men för att parafrasera Sokrates ""Jag är i alla fall smartarte än Anthony Robbins för jag fattar i alla fall att jag inte fattar något"""
,cl0wn,2005-04-08T11:54Z,richard bandler var programmerare (också). john grinder var professor i lingvistik (eller skulle precis ha fått en professur). 
,wakebreak,2005-04-10T00:46Z,"Frontpage: Whether this is good or not depends on where you're comming from and what you want to achieve, for my own sake I find it interesting. I only had a chance to listen to part of cd1 and mst say I am intrigued. You should download it and listen to it. It might not be for you, then again it might. "
,cl0wn,2005-04-11T15:23Z,deep4t: are you saying the PSYCHO-ANAL-lysts couldn´t help you? big surprise.. ;-)
,deep4t,2005-04-11T16:50Z,"lol,  oh yeah. heh, heh..

Its like this, they are a bit slow to take advantage of new ways of delivering information.   And the face to face sessions are so, like hmm, slow and tedious and just not much was happening.  An hour and 90 bucks, and come back next week...

When AR popped on the TV and did his rave, well a CC was handy and the rest is history

If the psychs got off their butt they could have done the same......
so why didn't they? 

Maybe they need a bit of their own medicine!, (if it works?)
 te he.. ;-)"
,deep4t,2005-04-11T17:02Z,"I also upped AR's ""Get The Edge"" which is smaller dl and usefull for a taste. GTE is a lot more accessible and easy to get into, not as much detail as ""Personal Power II"" though much more concentrated.  
I really dig the impact its message.  http://thepiratebay.org/torrents-details.php?id=3306453&hit=1"
,KravMaga,2005-04-20T07:19Z,"I really like the program. Good excersises and for me a great way to get better organized.

I wonder if someone also could upload the subliminals..."
,deep4t,2005-04-23T14:44Z,"KravMaga
I'm glad you like it, it gets better and better, like a great meal -)

the sublimimals are in CD 21 and 22.
its mentioned in the end of the CD titles.
(Hey, I nearly missed it too and I bought the things ;-0 )"
,paul36,2007-03-25T17:49Z,Im trying to download. it goed very slow. It says 1 peer 0 seeds. what can i do about it?  I downloaded other stuff with no problem before

First of all, you are a fucking idoiot! You know nothing about what you are speaking about. Yes richard bandler (not Anthony robbins!!) had some troubles with drugs when he was young. Who cares? It made him who he is today. And NLP is great, thanks to NLP I freed myself from OCD, GAD and PTSD compleatly.

It works if you really learn how to use it.

Keep your shity comments to your self!
This shit works!"
,Informante,2008-06-18T04:11Z,"Ingen aning: Shut up you fuck, this works and no one gives a shit about your fucking comments, so just go screw your mom you piece of shit!"
,Informante,2008-06-18T04:13Z,"Smart if you dont understand shit? If not knowing anything is being smart Ingan aning, then you are the world biggest genious you fuck, i bet no philosopher told you to talk shit about things you dont know you asshole. Luckily the rest of us, know better :D"
,powdR,2008-06-30T00:14Z,"ingen_aning: your nick is absolutely correct.

This very audio course was one of the primary reasons I reallized my life long dream: to sell everything, purchase a sailing yacht and circumnavigate. While I didn't get all the way 'round the world, I did get 18 months and all of the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, the Caribbean Sea and north of South America. 

One year after listening to this course, whilst packing down the shit in my apartment, I found the ""success journal"" Tony Robbins suggests you create and write in. I hadn't written in it for close to a full year. Reviewing it then, I was utterly shocked to see everything was realized - the dates, the sums, the people, the skill sets, everything I needed to acquire in order to circumnavigate, was close to pinpoint accuracy to the goals I set for myself. Then I left to sail :)

My original CDs got salt water on them while sailing (bad combination, it corrodes), now I want to listen to it again in order to realize another crazy idea :)

Have to second deep4t's original comment: if you like it, BUY THE SET, it is worth the money and it gives you a point of no return as you actually paid for it. As Bandler subcommuncates in his trainings ... ""You ordered it, so you have to eat it!"""
,Nilsss,2008-11-22T17:55Z,"I just reread what i wrote 1 year ago. And cant say i agree with what I wrote there anymore. 

NLP is a nice thing for getting goals done. That i belive to be true, but i think there are better ways than NLP to heal from anexiety disorders. "
