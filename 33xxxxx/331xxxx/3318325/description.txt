This is, in my opinion, the best game in the Settlers series by BlueByte.

The graphics are not actually good, but it's what you can expect from a game released in 1999.
The gameplay is really great and you have HOURS with campaigns where you can play as the romans, the asians, the egyptians and the amazons (which are women)


I really recommend this game!

NOTES:
I removed the audio tracks from the CDs, causing them to become 100-200MB smaller
Seeding WILL be slow to begin with, so don't cry about it. my connection is slow..
