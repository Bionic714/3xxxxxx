,FnF,2005-04-02T15:17Z,"Better use this one:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrents-details.php?id=3310450
This one has the orginal filenames and sizes, so 50x15, not 1 big file, if its corrupt, you have to redownload the whole file, if one is corrupt from here, you only have to download 15MB again :)"
[M],Q91,2005-04-02T15:57Z,"no fuck your mother, I haven't said one single bit against you spanish so dont go fucking swear on me"
[T],pctorrent,2005-04-02T16:36Z,"what are you saying Q91, the message isn`t for you stupid!!!!"
[M],Q91,2005-04-02T17:46Z,"oh sorry, you didn't specify who you sent to =P"
,willem1,2005-04-02T17:59Z,"fnf this is bittorrent, all files (rather the fragments) are protected by a SHA hash, when the download finished the files are guanteed to be what the uploader had.
It's not like ftp or irc where files can get corrupted or shortened and you need to redownload.

But with official releases it would be better to get the original rars, instead of pctorrent repackaging it just to add commercials"
[M],Q91,2005-04-02T18:47Z,"ofcourse, not that this release is fucked in anyways, but if it's not a guaranty that the files worked before the torrent was made.

This mighe be a problem for those are new to BT and makes torrents"
[T],pctorrent,2005-04-02T22:41Z,"hola amigos
