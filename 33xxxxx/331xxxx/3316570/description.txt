This is UFC 7 - The Brawl in Buffalo - which has got to be my favorite UFC events up to this point.  It's classic UFC tournament style with no weight classes ;)

The first round fights are:

Gerry Harris vs Paul Varelans
Mark Hall vs Harold Howard
Remco Pardoel vs Ryan Parker
Marco Ruas vs Larry Cureton

The winners go on to fight eachother until one remains. I won't give anything away except to say that this is one of the best UFC tournaments I've seen.

The superfight is: Ken Shamrock vs UFC 6 tournament winner Oleg Taktarov.

I wanted to give something back to you Pirate Bay guys who I got ufc 1-6 from.

Hope you enjoy this as much as I did.

PS I've only got 16 kb upload.  Please help me seed.
