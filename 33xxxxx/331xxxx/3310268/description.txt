A contemporary assassin and love story set to the moody blues of the electric underground of modern day Hong Kong. We follow a set of lost souls searching through their surrealistic environments, attempting to live in other ways, while escaping they're past and present. A contract hitman (Leon Lai) leaves his murdering occupation behind him while the woman (MichelleReis) who used to set up his jobs fall madly in love with him. Intertwined is a mute (Takeshi Kaneshiro) who makes a living running other people's businesses when they are closed and looks for companionship in the midst of the hazy night. Presented here are two stories entangled in, filmed like nightmares and dreams by world-renowned director Wong Kar-Wai.

Review:</b> There is something absolutely and stunningly beautiful about Wong Kar-Wai's films. Maybe it's the amazing poetic eye of his cinematographer, Christopher Doyle. Or perhaps, the ambient of the backdrops his characters live in that give each scene a particular sullen feel. Whatever the case may be, Wong Kar-Wai's worlds inhabit themes of lost and loneliness, darkness and despair, and the hopefulness that there is possibly a life other than the daydreaming.
What draw me in particular towards Wong Kar-Wai's movies are his characters. They are possibly a little too real and dramatic to believe but yet carry within themselves a sense of soul fullness that is hard not to feel a connection to. Instead of having his characters change through a series of events or situations that scale up and down on an emotional level throughout, Wai's characters become dynamic through inner monologues or a cinematic form of Faulkner's stream of consciousness. We get a chance to dive right into the workings of their mind, feel around in their thoughts and have the opportunity to be right there as they make their decisions, discover their epiphanies and realize what it is to experience beautiful.
Fallen Angels' Hong Kong seems to always live in the night, as if photographed and captured within a dream thought, neon-splattered and erotically blurred. While most movies pride themselves on gorgeous scenery or extravagant sets, Fallen Angels travels through empty stations, underworld markets, darkened coffee houses and the driest, brown-toned, brightly-lit McDonalds I've ever seen. Rarely do we see outside people within these places. Wai's characters seem to avoid the commotion and excitement of the real working world, and when they do come in contact with others, it's people like themselves.
Leon Lai's portrayal of a hired killer is profound and evokes a sense of jazzy surrealism. His exterior expression solicit apathy and laziness, but at the same time brings to attention something distinctly poetic about his gestures and the way he smokes his cigarettes that could lead viewers to believe otherwise. Even for a hitman, Lai plays it simple. Every wink and blink, tilt and whirl, and hand movement within his pocket along with his saxophone walk depicts a man in a present state of existentialism. Even a head tilt can be a blues tune set to indifference.
Though Michelle Reis' role is unusual as the woman who sets up Lai's jobs and cleans up after his assignments, her portrayal isn't any different. Her long black bangs hanging over her face shields herself into her own isolated world, away from the outside, bright life in front of her. Though she may seem obsessed with Lai and becomes emotionally attached to him, her absence of emotion sets the stages for the finale at the end as she comes undone on a motorbike, admitting how nice it feels to be with a man.
In the end, Takeshi Kaneshiro was my personal favorite. I don't know whether it was the way his character was written or just Kaneshiro himself who shined throughout for me. His smile is beautiful in ways I've never seen, lonesome and exuberant at the same time.There is an endearing quality to his face that makes you think he would be the best friend you'd ever have.</p>
					<p>The relationship between Kaneshiro's character, He Zhiwu, and his father is charming and unusual. Though humorous at first, the videotaped sessions between himself and his father become a boy just trying to capture small, miniscule moments with his daddy. Especially in the scene where Zhiwu is recording himself and his father sleeping side by side is ultimately beautiful and has a degree of boyish youthfulness all around.</p>
					<p>Fallen Angels is unlike any Hong Kong movie out there. The inner monologue driven story is completely unorthodox and the flow and pacing of the editing don't follow true continuity. It's so modern that it's hard to pinpoint exactly where and when the stories take place, and the main characters perpetually live in emotional and mental seclusion. But yet the film is one long poem, more in the manner of the free flowing styling of Jack Kerouac's spontaneous prose rather than the organized sonnets of Shakespeare. This movie is truly rich in atmosphere, emotion and depth.
