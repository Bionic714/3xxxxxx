,Totoro,2005-04-02T08:30Z,"Wow!!!! I'm a big fan of Wong Kar Wai!!! Thanks for this :D...., anybody have the asian version of Chungking Express?"
,raindog,2005-04-02T17:36Z,"Fallen Angels is one great film!! And this release in particular is absolutely wicked.

The Rolling Thunder pictures' release of Chungking Express is way better than the HK original. Some scenes are longer and it keeps the most important music in the film:

* California Dreamin' (The Mamas & the Papas) 
* Things in Life (Dennis Brown) 
* What a Difference a Day Makes (Dianah Washington)

,ChoAtic,2005-04-03T23:39Z,"Damn Dude, this one took time ;D"
,ChoAtic,2005-04-07T18:20Z,"Hey, thanks for a GREAT movie! I can´t stop look at it :)"
,BJK84,2005-04-13T00:39Z,"awesome movie Bratwurst! Good job, as always! :D"
,pizzathehut,2005-05-16T16:10Z,Thanks a bunch! I own a crappy old full screen VHS-copy of this - nice to upgrade at last.
,NirreFirre,2005-08-15T01:14Z,Thanks a lot! Me and my girl are big WKW fans and finally get to watch this one was awesome!
,anonymous4,2006-05-20T04:10Z,"Guys, can someone tell me how to watch this? I've extracted it using winrar but all it gives me is one huge winrar file called FALLEN_ANGELS_16X9 that's 3.9 gigs. Any suggestions? Do I have to extract this one as well?"
,turuk,2006-09-29T14:48Z,"anonymous4: extract it again (and damn the releaser for RARing it twice, but be happy again the next instant, when you can watch something so wonderful with your VLC player)."
,N0574,2007-06-11T03:37Z,"I want this movie bad, but I've been DLing it for about a week with no progress--it's apparently stuck. Does it need to be re-seeded? "
,QueenMidnight,2007-06-30T16:15Z,"Hi, I have a problem, I hope someone of you can solve. I wanted to upload the movie to a streaming site to spread the love, but I'm not familiar with this format. In VLC the only audio track which has sound for me is track 19, for the site to recognize the audio it would have to be track 1 though. And another thing I'm wondering about is, why are there so many files? Sorry if these are stupid questions, but I'm a little torrent illiterate and thanks."
,catpower Russia,2007-11-09T19:38Z,"I am absolutely in heaven - one of my favorite Kar-Wai film, picture is superb and the subtitles are very visible. thank you very much, DieBratwurst, for seeding! I wish someone re-seed Chungking Express, I am stuck with 10 people at 99.8 - thanx!"
,MovieDork,2008-05-26T04:42Z,"THANK YOU!!!

This was an absolutely excellent rip of a beautiful movie. The color and sound were perfect. Thank you once again!"
