Nobody quite knows who played on this album…the musicians are uncredited and Phantom himself is, well, Phantom! But what we do know about this 1974 cult fave is that it sounds like a heavier version of the Doors, with a real supernatural bent (sample song title: Black Magic White Magic). You’ve been warned…

This record is one of my all time favorites, so I chose it to be my first torrent, so be nice!  My upload is crap, so I won't seed it too long, others can hopefully help me.
