,bikes.,2005-04-19T00:35Z,"Ive been there, you should know that these are propaganda doc films, its the same kind as Gazaa Strip. They show you things, thats not exactly how they are. You should watch this film, but to be well informed i also urge you to watch docs from israeli point of view. :)"
,fadytabb,2005-04-19T03:13Z,"bikes,
I just had to laugh after I read your comment. You are recommending that we get the âIsraeli point of view""??? The Israeli point of view is rammed down our throats everyday!!
Thanks to the up-loader for giving us a refreshing look at this grave injustice. "
,pooky,2005-04-19T07:33Z,"its easy to sympathies with someone when you live far far away, where these people don't come in to your buses, markets and stores and blow themselves up with the rest of you around. 

Something more you should know. some of the buildings (i am sorry, i dont know the real precentage) were blownup by palesthinians not only to hurt the israeli forces directly but also to add to the distruction and make it look even worse. you must have heard about them leaving the dead outside to rot. both the sides were using ceviliance as live shields.

This movie was done by an arab of israeli nationality. this is NOT documentary, it is based on actual events."

A link to the most well known nazi group in Norway - they also support the palestinians 100%.I figure that Israel and the jews,at the top of the hate-list of the nazis,socialists,and the muslims,definately deserves my full support! With enemies like these,i consider them my allies.Propaganda-movies like this,with the lies of ""genocide"" in jenin,is a tool in the fight for a ""judenfrei"" world - as millions and millions of muslims continue to pour in to europe,it won't be long until europe is cleansed.So socialists,and nazis,rejoice! Your struggle is increasingly successful - attacks against jews are on the increase all over europe.The ""filthy jews"" are definately not safe on the streets of europe any more! "

Because a sick organization like Vigrid supports Palestinians you're saying all of us are like Vigrid? You're a simple person aint ya.. Actually, it's not I or anyone else in this thread that are racist. It's you, and your racist thoughts about muslims, socialists and god knows who.

Everytime someone disagrees with the Israelian's point of view, they're accused of hating jews.

Shut the fuck up with that.. it's not that simple. It's simply our point of view that your cleansing and illegal occupation of the palestinian area is illegal. Jews may live perfectly happy for my sake, just like everyone else, but to have a prime minister that has been charged for mass murdering is outrageous. 

Israel out of Palestina, and I'm happy."
,backdrop,2005-04-19T19:49Z,I've been looking for this for a long time... Thanks!
,backdrop,2005-04-19T19:59Z,"I know a guy who films for swedish television. When he was on his last trip to Israel he had to follow little schoolgirls to their school every day to keep the Israeli military from spitting at them along the way... That is insanely disrespectful. And to think that such acts, and ten times worse, that have been going on every day since 30 years back should be quietly accepted by the now economically ruined palestinians is also very very disturbing..."
,ToxicGumball,2005-04-20T00:40Z,"Can someone take over the seeding, I would greatly appreciate it; and thanks for the positive responses."
,FordPrefect,2005-04-20T07:49Z,"""but to have a prime minister that has been charged for mass murdering is outrageous. "" - Why? Thinking of sabra&chatila? The massacre of arabs by other arabs,that are blamed on the JEWS..(who else..?) Yes it was payback time for the christian arabs.Google ""Damour"",for instance,and read about PLOs massacres of lebanese civillians,and find out why they had it coming.

I bet that you reserved your indignation at ""someone accused of mass murder"",for the jew alone? Or did you feel the same way of the ex-terrorist Arafat..?"
,Mirvana,2005-04-21T19:55Z,"I guess even child rapists and psychos whom bury inoocent ppl and give them a walkie talkie so they he can hear then cry the last 30 minutes of their lives can justify their acts. There is nothing to blame on a single jew on this planet. They are done only by antisemites. To think, only afew of the jews of today are semites and there are over 300 million arabs that are semites. Still the term is reserved."
,Mirvana,2005-05-27T19:53Z,"96%......come on guys, seed!"
,thegrayrace,2005-06-04T22:40Z,"I haven't been to Jenin, but I have been to Hebron, Ramallah, Jericho, and Bethlehem, and the sentiments and views expressed throughout this film are the same things I had expressed to me throughout my time in Palestine. This documentary does a good job of conveying the Palestinian perspective of the ongoing oppression they have been forced to endure.

This documentary is through interviews with Jenin residents, there isn't any commentary. This film was widely criticized by supporters of Israel, but they have made consistent efforts to silence the voices of Palestinian suffering for decades. Hopefully films such as this, Gaza Strip, Death in Gaza, and future documentaries will bring to light the Palestinian perspective which is overwhelmingly under-represented in mainstream media, particularly in the United States."
,sailorbob,2005-07-10T07:02Z,"Wow, this ""documentary"" is basically one long lie.  The guy who made it was sued for libel in court by the families of the 23 Israeli soldiers killed in Jenin during the battle.   He was found guilty and ordered to pay compensation to the families.  Many of the lies in this movie are documented in a film called ""The Road to Jenin"".  You can also find info at:

,w000ter,2005-07-11T22:52Z,"the tactics of palestinian propagandists reak of those of creationists and goebels. keep repeating the refuted falsehoods until they stick. hoping to prey on the ignorant. it doesn't matter if they are lies, it doesn't matter if even you know they are lies, its all for the cause and anything for the cause is good. and why choose to push a lie? because that is your only choice when truth is not on your side. exactly like the creationists."

According to WorldNetDaily, Bakri admitted in a deposition last week to falsifying scenes, using inaccurate information and obtaining financing from the Palestinian Authority for Jenin, Jenin.
