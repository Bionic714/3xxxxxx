"Legendary 1970 South American garage psych album. The band were from Venezuela but were fronted by a North American vocalist and created some storming fuzz acid garage rock that definitely lives up to its lofty reputation."-FE

This band was formed by an American traveller with some Venezuelan musicians he met along the way. They only cut the one album, I believe.
Heavy psych-rock with some great acidic lead-guitar. This is from the Essex re-ish.
Enjoy!
