"Afterglow were formed in Oregon in the fall of 1965. They moved to San Francisco in October 1966 and recorded a number of songs at Golden State Recorders. Their only LP was recorded in late 1967 and released on MTA Records label in early 1968. The group disbanded sometime in 1968."-DD

This is one of my all time favourite albums. Many know this band from the much-comped track Susie's Gone, but that is really the one 'experimental' track on the album.
I consider this album to be the epitome of 'bright & breezy' psych-pop. It has weird tinny keyboards, wonderful but somehow off-kilter vocal harmonies.
All the songs are very short, many less than two minutes. Stand-out tracks for me are Riding Home Again and By My Side.
Bonus tracks included.
Enjoy!
