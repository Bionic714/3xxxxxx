,Slimpurt,2007-03-29T16:38Z,I am quite new to torrent so i got to ask: This torrent includes 4 files: 2 .cue files and 2 .bin. How are you supposed to start the game with just these files? There isn't even an executable file that you can crack... Please help me!
,HeQe-89,2007-05-31T19:10Z,"Please help me..it says ""error in command file"" what there should read? I have

,Ghen,2007-06-17T16:00Z,"@Slimpurt
.bin and .cue files are cd mount files which means you use a program like Daemon tools or Alcohol 120% which create a virtual drive inside your computer that shows up as a disk drive. Basically, they mimic you actually putting a disk into a drive on your computer so that you can install the game from the ""disk"""
,blashryk,2007-09-01T06:44Z,Try disabling your cd or dvd drive. That usually needs to be done because of the 2 drives working at the same time.
,blashryk,2007-09-01T06:48Z,Nope that didn't work this time. Needs something. maybe prot
,blashryk,2007-09-01T11:34Z,"Ok,go to Gamecopyworld.com and get the fix for this. Win the RAR file is done downloading extract the exe to your Silent Storm folder and say yes when something pops up asking if you want to replace it. If you download the patch you will have to do this again so don't think it's messed up. The patch just puts in new exe.It works perfect after that. Enjoy a great tactics game. And if your not a patient person then don't download torrets! And dont' play tactics games!"
,HeQe-89,2007-09-05T17:38Z,"THANKS A LOT=D=D It really works..Im really glad that here is person who help dummers=D Now I know why game crashed before.. cause i was downloaded win rar 1,4 patch exe not 1.0..but that 1.0 is the right one..once again,thank you:)"
,kingbingus,2008-02-22T05:00Z,Thanks for seeding this awesome game and thanks for the help running it (Alcohol 120% and the gamecopyworld no cd crack work great!).
,shencereys,2008-03-18T12:27Z,Thanks for seeding!  
,Mikbro,2008-04-11T19:28Z,"I got it to work perfectly, but...

,latvia08,2008-12-01T06:13Z,Yeah it would have saved me a lot of time if you had bothered to mention that this was in russian...

,seregaar,2009-04-04T23:31Z,??? ??????????
,seregaar,2009-04-04T23:31Z,How run game?
,Tintin_26,2009-04-13T06:39Z,"Okay follow these steps and the game should run (atleast it did for me):

- Mount the .bin files with PowerISO (don't think Daemon tools will work, I didn't try it though).

- Install the game as normal.

- Download game cracks (ENLISH - FIXED EXE) from Gamecopyworld (http://www.gamecopyworld.com/) 

You'll notice there are 2 crack files available on Gamecopyworld, one is v1.0, that's the one for the non-patched version of the game. If you want to patch the game, then download the patch and then download crack v1.2 to run the game. (The game will not run with  crack v1.0 after you have patched it, you will need crack v1.2 to make it run successfully!)

Btw, the patch can be downloaded from:

http://www.gamershell.com/download_4633.shtml

Hope this helps anyone having troubles in running the game. :)

How exactly do you download the crack file from Gamecopyworld??"
,ProfColonCleanr,2009-07-05T11:38Z,"Nvm, I found out you have to click the blue square, my bad."
,synchro_w,2009-11-09T14:16Z,"why are some ppl saying it's in russian? mine is in  english, works fine. had to change some settings in nvidia control panel tho before it ran"
,Nate2322,2009-12-14T06:40Z,"sooo......has anyone noticed that this torrent INCLUDED the crack? After you install the game, re-mount disc 1 in daemon toold and open the folder instead of running setup. there will be a folder called ""deviance"", in that folder is the crack, works perfectly."
,bock30,2010-05-14T11:46Z,"If anyone checks this thing I need some help.
I've opened one of the .bin files to PowerIso but have not clue what to do from there. I have the crack from gamecopyworld. I just really need step-by-step on how to mount etc. cause I'm noob like that.

Thank you"
