,Keep,2005-04-23T02:44Z,Thanks I have been looking for this game for a while.
,no-limit,2005-05-02T15:23Z,"Help me please! I've downloaded it-installed it and the I ran the TOEE_ANY-PATCH3. I then pasted the patch into the main folder. Still I got: insert the play disc. I then pasted the patch into every folder I could think of, but the same message came! What have I done wrong?

,iMMuNiTy,2005-06-13T08:01Z,"When I apply the crack (I can't apply the patch because a command line appears with ""Program too big to fit in memory"") and I try to play, an error that temple.dll couldn't be found. My best bet would be that the installation is screwed up. Any ideas?"
,dylller,2006-06-30T20:09Z,"seed please,i stuck in 96%,THANK YOU!!!"
,zaxu,2006-08-28T22:38Z,"Needs more seeds now, if anyone can seed plz do it now!"
,angma,2006-10-31T16:19Z,"Okay... here's the deal. TOEE doesn't seem to like Windows XP SP2 or Directx 9.0c. Troika went out of business, so the game only has fans to support it. There is a temple.dll fix, and the game is also known to blitz when enough virtual memory isn't present. Don't bother applying PATCH 3!!! It only updates temple.dll and the COPY PROTECTION! Go to co8.org to find fixes, patches, mods, etc. The game wouldn't even start for me on XPSP2 or 64-bit XP. The unofficial fan patch + Moebius temple.dll (after applying patch 2... don't bother with 3--the fan fixes won't work with it) fixed everything right up. This game ROCKS, but it really is riddled with bugs."

,sporg,2007-11-03T11:37Z,I just downloaded this and it does work but you must use daemon tools to install and use it. You must mount flt-toe1 and flt-toe2 as virtual drives at the same time  using daemon tools (it will ask for 2nd disc during install). Then once its installed use the patch to patch the Toee.exe file. Then replace the Toee.exe file in your game directory with the one supplied in this torrent. You may still have trouble with this game it is known to have lots of bugs.

,silkofboktor,2008-03-25T11:53Z,"ho!

i have just installed TOEE. it works pretty fine.
for you guys who can not run the game, try not to install the patch 3. just patch the crack into the appropriate folder. hope this could help you guys. *cheers* "
,silkofboktor,2008-03-26T11:21Z,"

try to use MAGIC ISO for unzipping the .cue file.

use magic iso to extract flt-toe1.cue to any folder u like. once the files have been extracted you can run the TOEE setup from there, it wont be asking you for the cd2.

after the installation, paste the TOEE crack into the folder where you have installed TOEE. 

(in my case i didnt use the patch 3)

then you can use patch 3, if you like. then run the game.
if it says insert cd or file too large..etc.  paste again the crack TOEE into your TOEE folder. (overwriting it again. but that's fine) patch 3 is all about fixing the looting bug in the game.

,andchi,2008-04-17T14:47Z,The game quits and jump out to Windows after the Wizards-logo in the intro. Any clues?
,junwi,2008-05-15T06:27Z,"Kaspersky said the toe.exe crack was a trojan and deleted it.

When I installed the patch, every time I tried to open the game, Kaspersky pops up with another trojan warning and deletes the file.

Anyone know what's going on?"
,fvjm19,2008-06-07T23:26Z,.exe contains Trojan :S
,raphfran,2008-09-02T19:33Z,"i'm still downloading it but i'd like to leave an advise: there's a trojan on a .exe file.
I wonder why is that? is it a bad joke? My avg healed it, but i'm worried about that!"
,skyydragonn,2008-11-11T05:44Z,"Once again for those too lazy to google the name of the ""trojan"" thier anti-virus reports 99% of the time that ""trojan"" is the crack/hack used to make the game you just downloaded playable. as for the poor sod using Kaspersky get better anti-virus something that lets you decide what to do with the damn file instead of just telling you ""nah you dont want to crack this program, let me just delete that for you.""
serious folks 2 minutes on google look up the suspect file name usually theres no info on it becuase its not a virsus but a game crack.
what the hell do you think your downloading developer keys to just pop the game for you without paying for it??
-.-"
,Ba_76,2009-01-07T23:52Z,"Awesome game thanks for the torrent but one question please..

After i install patch 3 it tells me to insert the cd, i apllied the crack after installing the patch3 but it doesnt seem to work, i still am unable to loot or sometimes even open or close doors, any help plase because this game looks so great.

Thanks."
,ScorpioNovem,2009-03-16T00:50Z,"About the trojan...
http://www.viruslist.com/en/viruses/encyclopedia?virusid=92863
Ok it's not .Wnj but still, 290kb/29.0kb
I wouldn't risk it. But that's just MHO"
,JoystickHero,2009-04-15T07:56Z,"Cracked .exe almost always come up as trojans, you dumb fucks."
,flaming_telepath,2009-04-18T03:25Z,"wth?
it doesnt have an installer?
what gives?"
,flaming_telepath,2009-04-29T20:05Z,"alright, all mounted and installed.
but it wont start the game. it says that pytoee.dll cant be found.

ive looked in the folder and the dll IS there. but it still wont start up. any suggestions?"
,Xiloscent,2009-11-04T02:56Z,lol ledzepelins link is dead. probably for posting it in other peoples comments
,deathhead,2010-01-06T07:02Z,"Cool, I'll get this after I finish downloading NecroVisioN: Lost Company."
,jmhimara,2010-01-25T21:43Z,cmon seeeeeeed!!!!!
,zanzibart,2012-03-21T09:49Z,"There is a much better way to do this.
1) Install the game as directed (you will have to mount cd1 and then cd2 when it asks you to).  
2) Go here: http://www.co8.org/forum/showthread.php?t=6695 and skip to step 4 (your successful install took care of steps 1-3). [I sure hope they don't change it and add a step or these instructions will be screwed.]
3) As directed, install the latest NC version of the CO8 mod pack (currently the latest is 7.1.0 NC).  This install includes no-cd.
4) Enjoy the cleanest, most bug-free, most true to D&D rules version that you will find.  Also enjoy all the new content they thoughtfully developed."
