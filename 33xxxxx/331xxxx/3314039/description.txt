04-04-2005 added: Execute functions: XBMC.PlayerControl(action), where action can be: Play, Stop, Rewind, Forward, Next, Previous. Useful for OSD stuff.
04-04-2005 added: New dialog window PlayerControls.xml. id is 114. Can be anything you like, but I suspect you'll want to use it for actual playercontrols, as it is only displayed while something is playing! Suggest mapping to pop this window up on START. Does not display on the FullScreenVideo screen as we have an OSD for that anyway.
