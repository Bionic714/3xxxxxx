,armanix,2005-04-12T00:45Z,"hey buddy, can you PM me the cd key then? i get no result on kazaa"
,Bedrovelse,2005-04-12T11:58Z,"The problem with most SF mini-images is that the games are regional. So if you have a mini-image made for a European version, it won't work with a US version.

That's been my painful experience with trying to get V8 Supercars 2 to work with DTM/Toca Race Driver 2 images."
,bitye,2005-04-12T15:00Z,All of this anti sf3 programs are viruses or trojans!

,hoangpt,2005-04-12T23:20Z,Any1 try it? Does it work or fake? Like virus or spy.
,Apothecary,2005-04-13T13:39Z,"Daemon-tools and Alcohol120% are both blacklisted by the StarForce3 protection, and that's why it won't allow mounting with mini-image.
And you only have to match the serial with the right regional mini-image, the content is the same. But wait for D-tools 4 for a patch to the blacklist! "
,Carolus-Rex,2005-04-14T13:54Z,Can someone explain exactly how to get this game work
,lancers815,2005-06-23T07:16Z,wait how are you guys getting a working CD key please somone help me...
,motleyfun,2005-07-10T20:26Z,this is not a nocd patch!!!! if its anything its a patch to disable starforce protection so the game can be loaded with alcohol or daemon tools. There is no nocd patch yet!!!!

,abletonlive05,2008-06-14T11:32Z,i downloaded this (not from this website) and tried the starforce nightmare and evrything. the mini-image will mount. However you have to find the seriel number associated with the miniimage. apparently the one bundled with the installation is not the same. apparently either the install is the us version or the uk version and the mini image is the opposite.
