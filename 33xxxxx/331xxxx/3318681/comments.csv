,da_hawk,2008-02-22T12:07Z,"I know these arn't rare... but, as I said in the description, it's a BOOTLEG. bootlegs often come with a name attatched."
,foreverflash,2008-03-14T23:33Z,"Excuse me folks, but your all wrong. More than half of these songs ARE rare in certain parts of the world, such as the United States. Don't make the uploader feel stupid with your ignorant comments. This is a nice collection. 

Songs like all the ones w/ The Agents & the song that came from their first official album (w/ Ville's mother on the cover) are definitely rare, as are the demo's included in this mix. 

I personally had much trouble finding just the songs from their official first album; I never even knew these other songs with ""The Agents"" existed. I'm quite pleased.

Thank you da_hawk, this is much appreciated."
