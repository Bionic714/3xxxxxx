Mac rules! 

Well I guess YOU know that..... ;)"
,Yaroze2004,2005-04-06T01:46Z,Where did u find info about 8A428?
,plastique45,2005-04-06T04:29Z,"Appleinsider: http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=976

,Netzach,2005-04-06T20:48Z,"Jo, Slashdot (/. got it? :-D) känns väl lite mer säker än de tidigare två."
,Zacka,2005-04-07T07:57Z,Var nöjda med uploaden åtminstonde.
[V],pythonx,2005-04-07T14:24Z,innehåller den svenskt språkstöd?
,zebmac,2005-04-07T15:42Z,"Jodå, svenskt språkstöd finnes. Har provinstallerat det på en extern hårddisk. Såg ut att funka bra, men min ""C""-tangent ville inte riktigt fungera ihop med denna release av tiger. Kanske inte är GM-versionen trots allt?"
,Ssargon,2005-04-08T13:24Z,Det komemr man nog inte att kunna göra. Det har man aldrig kunnat med tidigare RC.
,printerart,2005-04-08T18:16Z,"Har uppdaterat min 10.3.8 med den här och det fungerar alldeles utmärkt.
Är göör nöjd."
,ClarkCable,2005-04-08T20:20Z,"Cool,, jag tror dock jag väntar en vecka eller två på the real thing.."
,xcuneytx,2005-04-08T22:35Z,Does anyone know how to burn this image on a Windows PC. I dont have a DVD burner on my Apple Computer.?????
,plastique45,2005-04-09T02:28Z,Latest internal build is 8A432.
,huy,2005-04-09T07:14Z,This is not GM.
,hoka,2005-04-09T09:32Z,"followed all the instruction but can not start up from burned DVD or resored HD, my PB g4 just crashes on startup!"
,jurke,2005-04-09T22:56Z,"Junk... Står bara kan inte installera ""Base System"""
,plastique45,2005-04-09T23:17Z,Never DL or try to install a beta OS.
,L.Jamf,2005-04-10T01:08Z,"Installed as described, except: skipped the last part, #7 (renaming); works fine—faster than 10.3.8—only, some apps won't run, e.g. NetBarrier and Traktor DJ Studio."
,treqie,2005-04-10T13:15Z,Did you burn it on a mac? I tried Nero - since it's just an iso.. it didn't boot.. but the disc works. 
,L.Jamf,2005-04-10T14:42Z,"No need to burn it, if your harddisk's partitioned."
,piroco,2005-04-11T11:09Z,"Anyone knows how to get this build up an running? I understand some of you have managed to get it to boot - mine just crashes after the blue screen on my iBook G4. I've CarbonCopied the DVD image to an external HD, which should be bootable, but so far with little success."
,L.Jamf,2005-04-11T13:01Z,Following the instruction at the top worked for me.
,pgjores,2005-04-11T14:29Z,Asså? När jag har gjort det då... Måste man fortsätta installera det över mitt gamla system då eller? Jag kopierade det till min ipod och sen när jag bootar så kommer hela installationsprocessen igång. Installerar jag över mitt panthersystem då? 
,L.Jamf,2005-04-11T17:04Z,Hvis du har opdelt harddisken: brug Disk Utilitys restore funktion til at overføre indholdet fra tiger.iso til den del af harddisken hvor dit nuværende OS ligger (følg anvisningens punkt 1-6); installer derfra til en anden del af harddisken.
,ClarkCable,2005-04-12T00:10Z,När kommer Tigern ut på riktigt??
,olksinghar9,2005-04-12T15:24Z,"TIGER IS ANNOUNCED ! to be shipped by 29th of April !

,ClarkCable,2005-04-12T23:51Z,"So,, is this the GM or is the 8A432 the GM??"
,jokell,2005-04-13T05:55Z,8a428 is the GM
,ClarkCable,2005-04-13T22:50Z,"Oki,,, can you DL it somewhere???"
,langstraad,2005-04-14T19:39Z,"Just confirming that this worked for me. It's 8A425 and fully bootable. Still looking for 8A428, though!"
,mammas_gyro,2005-04-15T22:40Z,Anyone got version 10.0.2  beacuse my protools doesn't support newer versions.
,zornzorn,2005-04-17T05:04Z,"I didn't read the directions very well and used toast.
TOAST DOES NOT WORK!!!  

I recommend that after you load it your go to ""Software Updates"" under System Preferences and uncheck the box that tells it to look for updates automatically.  You should not be looking for updates on software that hasn't been released.

This works well.  I used disk utility to burn it to a DVD.
Thanks for this."
,MTM,2005-04-18T23:12Z,"This works at a normal laptop, right?"
,plastique45,2005-04-19T02:02Z,"""So,, is this the GM or is the 8A432 the GM??""

8A425=Beta
8A428=Gold Master
8A432=10.4.1 (Required for DVD SP 4, TBA soon after Tiger)"
,ClarkCable,2005-04-19T13:41Z,Do you need to register at bt.eastgame to get it to work??
,ClarkCable,2005-04-19T14:06Z,"I´m talking to my self, hehe ;)
No! you dont need to register,, it´s working fine."
,xcuneytx,2005-04-20T00:55Z,"Can you later upgrade from the GM to 10.4.1, 10.4.2 and so on..."
,zanoi,2005-04-20T10:56Z,ClarkCable: did it install OK?
,tonybaloney,2005-04-20T12:15Z,"What do I do with this folder full of .xiso files? I've been all over the web - there are a few Mac apps to CREATE xiso's, but none that I can find that will CONVERT them to, say, standard ISO's. (In fact, Mac OS X Box Tools tells me that it can't do anything with these files - somehow they're ""not valid xISO archives.""

Any help would be enormously appreciated... TIA"
,macmicke,2005-04-20T13:40Z,"I have 45.8% down on the 04.17.05 Tiger xiso. And started a download on a 04.19.05 If somebody can verify that this is the GM version would be nice.

(Xiso is used with xbox iso files. Can it be used with toast?)"
,torsk6,2005-04-20T15:48Z,XISO is a chines torrent site not a formate
,sugplopp,2005-04-20T23:19Z,"You should be able to restore the dmg to an external hd as described in the description. I've downloaded the 8A428 which is said to be GM. Installed perfectly after i burnt it to dvd via discutility. I'm quite happy.

:D"
,belmonte62,2005-04-20T23:53Z,"Success! I restored my 5Gb iPod with the dmg, and rebooted from the iPod, now named Mac OS X Install DVD. Install went well, and now I run 10.4. All I have to do now is to restore my iPod again..."
,xcuneytx,2005-04-21T18:06Z,"Belmonte can you please explain me. how I can do this...
1) Where did you download it? What version Tiger is it?...
2) I have a 4GB iPod Mini and an iBook with Firewire, but no DVD burner...
How can I install Tiger on my iBook using the iPod Mini as a external hard disc.... How shoul I bring the dmg to the iPod mini and how can I start from this dmg then....
Please telll me al this and I will kiss your feet!!!! :)"
,xcuneytx,2005-04-21T18:24Z,"sugplopp where did you download the goldmaster, 8A428?"
,xcuneytx,2005-04-22T11:48Z,DOES anyone know if you can upgrade from Tiger 8A428 to 10.4.1 in the future? I heard about other betas that this was not possible?????????
,microdot,2005-04-22T19:04Z,"hmm, have an1 got that problem with an iPod that the name is to long? how can i make it longer?"
,sipefree,2005-04-23T11:56Z,"Seriously, what do you do with the xiso files?"
,sugplopp,2005-04-23T15:15Z,"you download unrarx (from http://unrarx.sourceforge.net/) and install it. your xiso folder is full of files named xxx xxx.r01, xxx xxx.r02, etc. at the end there's a file called xxx xxx.rar - doubleclick that one and unrarx will unrar everything in the xiso-folder and create a 'mac osx install dvd.dmg' or something like that.

don't mount that one - burn it via disc utility (skivverktyg) or restore it to another partition as described earlier.

good luck!"
,riha,2005-04-23T23:29Z,"This is not the GM version. The GM version is 4a428 and NOT 4a425.

Take a loook on the internet or search for it and you will see that i am right.


Just to warn you that it is an BETA version you are downloading, if downloading this torrent.

I would gladly like to see version 4a428 instead."
[V],pythonx,2005-04-24T00:21Z,8a428 is here on TPB. take a look around.
,gary1962,2005-04-24T14:53Z,Is this version multilingual and able to upgrade? (silly question maybe.....)
,scrunter71,2005-04-25T00:50Z,"This isn't the final release version. The build number should be 8A428.

,ElPotenzo,2005-04-26T01:28Z,dumm fråga... om jag installerar tiger kommer mina filer att försvinna? är ny med mac och vet inte riktigt
,perihelion,2005-04-27T11:15Z,"Finns säkert en uppgraderingsfunktion i tiger som gör att du får behålla dina filer. Men om du är ny kanske du inte har så mycket filer och en ""ren"" installation är nog alltid att föredra (åtminstone i windowsvärlden, är själv ny på mac)"
,killedbylove,2005-04-28T20:42Z,I would also enjoy a bootable iso! :)
