OK here's 2 shows from the great canadian band The Mcrackins, i filmed both these shows back in 1996 and both are great. They are filmed in my usual high standard and i highly recommend everyone into the poppier side of punk rock to check these goofballs who dress like eggs out. Anyway i hope you enjoy them!

Mcrackins-Nice & Sleazy Glasgow 8th November 1996 SVCD
Mcrackins-Panthers Kircaldy Fife 9th November 1996 SVCD

These are in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and they will play in most DVD players. They will fit on 2x 80min blank cd-r's using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.         http://www.videolan.org/
