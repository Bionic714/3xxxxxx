This is gay, who the f**** uplodas a cd in WAV in this age (anno 2005), at 700mb.... got damn it, could someone do this in MP3???

Also, the dick who ripped this .... Have put the tracks together, its so lame, I cant even describe it....

A nice album, but a freak seeder, who left faster than any of us could get the 700mb album....

,thailx,2012-04-07T20:15Z,I know it was yrs ago but that Cpx guy is a moron.  Some people listen to their music through a $3000 hi-fi and not $30 logitech pc speakers and they value high quality uploads.  Ignorant fuck.
