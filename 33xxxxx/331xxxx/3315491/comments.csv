,aeli,2006-01-26T18:01Z,"  I agre with Drake.  People think so much about what's going into the viewscreen, they forget the power of what coming out.  When I first read this book, I thought the switching of Eurasia and Eastasia was over the top, but then I got to watch the U.S. media morph Osama bin Laden into Saddam Hussein.  And I watched people believe it -- even here, in Canada.  And unlike TV, the viewscreens didn't switch off: it broadcast propaganda at you every minute of every day.  Eventually, you just believe.  So the famous quote is true, it's just that a couple of words are out of place.  It should say: 'Big Brother is you watching.'"

,msudude,2006-06-08T02:44Z,thanks for this.
,ishroo,2008-04-24T03:53Z,anybody who has listened to this know what order the mp3s go in? The numbering seems to be mixed up.
,suchagoodboi,2008-06-15T15:02Z,honestly! I do so tire of people uploading mis-labeled mp3's !
,iwasakabukiman,2008-08-07T17:46Z,What order do the tracks go in? The numbering makes no sense!
