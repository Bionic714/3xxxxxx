,foxraf,2006-07-31T20:24Z,"I installed this and followed the instructions.  I can see the deleted files I want to recover BUT I can only recover movie files, the picture files show but don't save when I want to save.  Does this work for anyone else?"
,MickeHyman,2006-11-20T11:41Z,"Well what can I say I also followed the instructions but it still only works as the free downloadable demo version. It doesn't work to save the thumbnails of photos.'
Anyone who knows any other software that can recover lost media from a CF memory card?"
