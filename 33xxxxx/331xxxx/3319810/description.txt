Summary: The world as we know it has ended. Dinosaurs, mutants and barbarians are abundant. The poor barbarian girl, played by Corwin, had to become nymphoid in order to survive. (However, this does not mean you'll see her naked in the movie. Actually, I'm not sure Troma's definition of nymphoid is in any way similar to the one people are used to.)
