,crax_pt,2005-04-07T02:43Z,hi mate. is this an official release? or it was a conversion from the 2.0 audiocd to 51. and dts?
,AudiophileSD,2005-04-07T03:39Z,"It's a Stereo to Surround mix yes, there is no official St.Anger surround mix from Metallica."
,TheAbsorbant,2005-04-07T11:03Z,Couldn't you basically just play the audio CD through a Dolby Pro Logic decoder and get the same result?
,AudiophileSD,2005-04-07T11:35Z,"Yes you can but then you won't have the center and surround speakers in correct phase, it would not sound as good as if you did a real 5ch mix with each channel defined on what to play."
,STW,2005-04-07T18:48Z,Great stuff! Thanx..How about Master of Puppets and justice for all albums?..Next project?
,AudiophileSD,2005-04-07T22:31Z,"Well new surround albums is granted, Master Of Puppets and Justice album... maybe... :)"

,modperl,2007-06-08T13:16Z,"Whenever the sound becomes intense, the volume seems to drop. Multiple intruments and vocals combined sound quiet. A single instrument sounds loud. Does anybody else have this problem?
I tried both Windows Media Player and InterVideo WinDVD and had the same problem."
,Instrumentallyinsane,2007-09-23T17:46Z,"Actually, there IS an official surround mix, but only for the songs ""St. Anger"", ""Frantic"", and ""The Unnamed Feeling"".  Get them here:

,s.o.b.,2009-06-22T00:01Z,"great record, thx dude!

but how exactly could you upmix a stereo source to 5.1?

any info would be greatly appreciated."
,s.o.b.,2009-06-22T00:12Z,"sorry to bother you again: unfortunately from about 3:10 of some kind of monster to the end of the song both formats are totally destroyed :-(

anyone else experienced this?"
