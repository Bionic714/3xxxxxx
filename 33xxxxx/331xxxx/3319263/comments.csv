,muddy,2005-04-21T06:36Z,"Naah, i don't think so ... TPB has been running quite unstable last few days. Maybe they're working on some upgrades - hopefully!?!? ;)"
,muddy,2005-04-21T06:59Z,"What about port forwarding, firewall and that kind of stuff?"
,dj321,2005-04-21T13:22Z,"It says on the index page that we might have problems connecting. And my client Azureus doesn't support multiple trackers, so I'll just wait until they fix the problem."
,muddy,2005-04-23T13:11Z,Thanks dj321 :D

,DaCapo_x,2006-04-28T22:56Z,"Denna funkar ju finfint! (Åtminstone Cd1, har inte kört Cd2 ännu). Bara att Zippa upp, ladda med daemon och kopiera med nero.

Ok, vissa filmer hackar ibland men med tanke på priset så ^^"
,Mangorök,2006-05-28T16:43Z,"varför låser sig skivan när man kommer till det där stället där de onda bränner ner skogen ? 
Har testat om spelet 4 gånger och det händer så på samma ställe."
,Yes12345,2006-10-16T14:27Z,"Ok, I have the game and mounted the ISO's, when the game comes up, it's only visible on the top half of the screen and after selecting no cheats at the start the game just freezes on a loading screen, can anyone help?"
,Yes12345,2006-10-19T16:30Z,My emulator wont play this as it has that thing at the start and it's not a solid dump... what emulator will play this?
,Yes12345,2006-10-19T21:56Z,"Nevermind, I got it working in the end"
,kanonlover,2006-10-25T05:04Z,"Does anyone know how to make this file work?

,RevengeBomber,2007-03-18T20:14Z,"Use WinRAR or PowerArchiver (or, on linux, unrar) to extract. Then burn the image and put it in your Model 1 Dreamcast console. 

Emulators are for pussies."
,Balthasar00,2007-04-30T00:53Z,"This game work with NullDC. You will need a strong PC in order to get it work smoothly. So, in short, If you are a cheap fag like RevengeBomber, it certandly won't do. ;)"

,7venoh3,2010-06-06T21:03Z,has anyone got this working to play on the DC irl? not an emulator
,Alrissa,2011-03-05T18:40Z,"The game has a trainer which crashes emulators.

If you don't have a dreamacst? Tough luck."
