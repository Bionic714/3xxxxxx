,tomj1225,2007-10-16T05:46Z,"I am the only seeder on this torrent. I don't mind doing it. But what PISSES me off is that my Azureus says I have a 6.0 ratio on this, and that I am the only seeder. Now what that means is that I've uploaded this entire file to at least six other people, all of who are to fu%*&ng lazy to do the same. So they hit and run and then take it for themself but don't keep on seeding and uploading it for others. YOU people are pathetic. Now that I've said that and gotten it off my chest, I will continue to seed this. I am also seeding EVERY complete season of Mash and will do so until I feel that they have pervaded the internet and will live on for infamy. Only because Hawkeye rocks."
,jepensedoucjsuis,2007-10-16T15:58Z,"I will seed toll I get a 3.0 ( in other word untill 3 people get it from me, I only have DSL I can not aford the constant strain on  my already limited bandwidth. ) But people need to learn how this works, even if you only seed to a 1:1 at east then your shared your part.
