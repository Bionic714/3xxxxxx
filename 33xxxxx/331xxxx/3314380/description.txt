Judea Declares War on Germany: 



A Critical Look at WWII. Hosted by Dr. Fredrick Toben, this intriguing documentary shows a little-known aspect of WWII, in which Jews at one time declared war on Germany. In response to this, many Jews were incarcerated in prison camps, similar to what America did to the Japanese. Some Germans even claim that prior to the war's end when supply lines were cut and starvation and disease was rampant, Jews were treated more humanely than the Japanese in American prison camps. See what such talk is based on. Many rare photographs, and some surprising footage showing the prison camps as they are today. 

BONUS!  See live experiments proving the impossibility of burning bodies in open pits and volunteers sealed inside a room with Zyklon B - after ONE HOUR they walk out alive!

Guaranteed to get jews everywhere spitting venom!
