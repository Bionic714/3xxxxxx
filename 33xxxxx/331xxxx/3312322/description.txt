  Review	- The focus switches back to Chicken in this installment.
A leader in the rival Ting Sung society (Cheung) kills one of the Hung Hing 
boys, which sets up a power struggle between Chicken and Cheung's protege Barbarian for control of a key district. Ho Nam, after having numerous loved 
ones snuffed in the past three movies, tries to talk Chicken out of taking a leadership role, but Chicken thinks it's his time and ignores him. You probably know what happens next--lots of double-crosses, tested loyalties and beatdowns galore. Will Chicken become triumphant and become a boss of his own?
