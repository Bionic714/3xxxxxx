I have finnally found a crack that works and lets you play the whole game without errors.

just make sure you download the 1.2.0.1 Patch from www.gamespot.com before you use this crack

http://www.gameburnworld.com/gp/gamefixes/nascarracing2003season.shtml

if the link for some reason doesn't work go to:

http://www.gameburnworld.com   , go to game fixes and navigate your way to the crack.

Enjoy"
,billcat,2006-11-21T03:35Z,I have the game downloaded and running properly (with some minor sound issues) but it would not allow me to install the 1.2.0.1 patch to upgrade the game.  It gives me a message that NR 2003.exe is not a valid previous version and cannot be updated.  Does anyone know of any way around this?  Thanks!
,Jim01,2006-12-16T04:48Z,billcat dunno I didn't have any problems like that so I wouldn't know.  Anyway did the the source of the patch tell you how to install it? cuz I can't remember . anyway the sound issues might be just your sound card or maybe the settings in the game as I have no such problems
,JRice80,2006-12-25T23:50Z,"It says ""could not find iKernel"" or something like that when I try to install it.  What is this?"

,jasperik,2007-06-27T01:16Z,"@DBCHAMP

search the internet for a program called VCDControl tool.
it makes your PC think there is anothar harddisk wich is actually the game so you dont need the disc.........
i cant tell you how the program works cuz i cant remember and its a bit hard for the first time.
i used the program and i can play the game without needing a disc.
i hope thet strange post helped you out somehow."
