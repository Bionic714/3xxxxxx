,rst_mama,2006-10-07T12:51Z,"little question about the subs, because i already downloaded this movie for a useless result:
are the english subs in a separate file (srt or something) so i can replace this file with my french subtitles ???"
,rst_mama,2006-10-10T14:16Z,"ok, stupid question i guess, because files=1, so the english subs must be within the movie... arf."
,pofkezas,2007-09-23T23:29Z,"Descent quality, English subs hard-coded. Fantastic film! Needs more seeders though, really slow download."

,mariannal,2009-12-14T00:24Z,somehow I also did something wrong: no subtitles at all
