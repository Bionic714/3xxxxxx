,amanita,2005-06-05T10:44Z,"Disc 1 has bad file numbering. 1-5 OK, but the next track has been given the number 7 instead of 6. But that is perhaps agavero's way of counting? :)"

,tavisjohn,2007-06-25T22:02Z,"They are MP3's, there is no special codec you need... Windows Media Player can play them...  However I prefer WinAmp myself...

Just download a new or updated media player and it will play them..."
,Verbal41,2008-03-04T13:03Z,"Song # 14 on Disc 5 - ""I'm a man you don't meet every day"" is not sunged by Sinead.
As far as I can hear, it's the original recording from Pogues album ""Rum, sodomy & the lash"", and there is no Sinead listed among the credits of that album. Great song though!"
