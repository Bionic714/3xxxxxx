I'm moving in the next 2 days, and don't know what the future hold for another network connection.  I am moving into a highly populated apartment complex into ANOTHER room for rent.  

I'll be scanning the place tomorrow with my Palm T3 and wi-fi card...so who knows...maybe a free connection.

The bad news is, it's going to be 36kiloBYTES a second instead of 110...fucking sucks.  Maybe I'll get really lucky and nail a fractional t1 or something with a high gain atenna, but I doubt it.

I am thinking of going with a Directional Yagi Antenna...if anyone knows a good source, please email it to me.

The situation I was in was good...having 7 people sharing a single network connection...it would have beeen hard to get in trouble, as anyone could be blammed.  It's not going to be like that now.

I'll be checking back in this torrent's thread for advice on high db gain wi-fi jacking and gear via GRPS on my phone.  I was told to take my router out of this cunt's room, so yay...10kbps connection via bluetooth.

Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks
