Ok, I got a lot of requests to encode this movie, even though there are like 370 versions of it already out.  I have to agree though - they are all done incorrectly.

Check out the closeups of the people's faces, and look at the detail around the eye and jaw.  Try this even with all pre-processing off...it still looks better.

I'm not going to seed this one like crazy, so please, try to seed it a bit for me after you complete it.

I also included external subtitles in French and Spanish in VOBsub format.

If you download a subtitle pack from the net, make sure it's 23.97 FPS, or it's not going to match the picture.

If you are going to watch this, you'll want to install the NEW XviD codec:

http://www.koepi.org/XviD-1.1.0-Beta1-16012005.exe

For top quality, make sure you use the XviD decoder configerator, and turn on
(Y) and (UV) deblocking, and the new feature of XviD 1.1.0 (Y) and (UV) DERINGING.

If you have a slow computer, turn it off. I don't want another stupid motherfucker telling me that my movies are out of sync because they are totally computer illiterate.
