This pack was collected by me and it works!! :)
I've played it more than 6 month now ... no problems. I also played it with steering wheel (microsoft steering wheel) with no problems at all.
This is my first torrent ever! .. I hope it is useful.
Enjoy!"

Hi!
You just bur the .cue file with, for example Nero Express.
Just click on Disc Image or Saved Project.
Choose Image files (*.nrg;*.iso;*.cue) and then your .cue file. Click on Open.
And just Burn!!!"
