Meet the Barkers. MTV's new "The Osbournes", but even better.

Starring Travis Barker [Blink 182, The Transplants] and Shana Moakler [Former Playboy Playmate]

Quoting signonsandiego.com about the first episode of "meet the barkers":

"It takes less than 10 minutes for MTV's "Meet the Barkers" to reveal a side of blink-182 and Transplants drummer Travis Barker that even his loved ones haven't seen in years.

Thanks to the magic of reality television, friends and strangers alike can witness Barker losing his lunch to one of the worst hangovers of his 29-year-old life. But it's doubtful that anyone will enjoy the "Meet the Barkers" Morning After Theatre as much as the Barkers do.

"Trav couldn't believe it," Barker's wife, Shanna Moakler, said from a Century City restaurant. "It was the first time that he'd gotten sick since he was a baby, and they filmed it! It was very funny."
