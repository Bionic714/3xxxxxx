,darencmp,2005-04-04T20:53Z,"Hi,
really great upload!!
Big thanks...
a little question:
French subs are available on this DVDR???"
,fytta,2005-04-05T11:15Z,"DieBratwurst- well, you may be just about right, insomuch as wim wenders has lost - what he ONCE was in cinema. He would - being a philosopher about time/space/memory/film that he is - indeed be the first one to acknowledge that. He has probably gone on to other things in his mind. Everything and everybody has its time and place."
,DieBratwurst,2005-04-05T13:48Z,You are right. In my opinion he should simply stop directing since his films get worse and worse. He has several production companies and should stick to producing.
,DieBratwurst,2005-04-05T17:14Z,"Dear Steffen123, thank you very much for this upload. But what on earth is your upload speed? 

Cheers, DieBratwurst"
,steffen123,2005-04-05T21:46Z,"Sorry people, all I can give is 5-10kbps constantly, but I guarantee that you all will complete this one.
Easy, just be patient, the movie is 20 years old."

This is the new German DVD edition, right? 
And by reading the filename, I guess it also has the German DD5.1 present on the disc? "
,yarn,2005-04-09T10:16Z,"PLZ SEED THIS MOVIE!

,hfw,2005-04-11T10:16Z,"May I suggest a miniscule of seeding activity... mmmm ?

,steffen123,2005-04-15T15:49Z,"Could some nice scandinavian kindly translate this outburst by naugas, please ?"
,sinatora,2005-04-16T14:01Z,"SEEDA, PLEASE!!!!!"
,steffen123,2005-04-30T15:48Z,"Thanks to you all, my ratio is 3.3 now, I upped 14.4 GB.

,steffen123,2005-05-03T21:39Z,"I liked both versions even the one from Hollywood, but soory no I don't have it. Maybe TV shows it sometime...
I could do a DVB-S-Rip, would german audio be ok ?"
