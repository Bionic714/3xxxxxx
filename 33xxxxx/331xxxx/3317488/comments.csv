,Leonard89,2005-04-17T12:46Z,Vet nån varför avsnitt 21 har blivit uppskjutet???
,lleb,2005-04-17T23:39Z,"sorry the upload is so slow, but that is all the bandwidth i get durring the day.

Please be patient with this, the quality is very good on the episodes.  Yes this is the first 20 IIRC all are HDTV quality."
,Oojl,2005-04-18T17:05Z,snälla kan inte nån seeda så man får ner avsnitten....
,raivopää,2005-04-18T18:46Z,21 är uppskjutet för att de har en liten break i USA.
,lleb,2005-04-18T18:49Z,"på 7G är jag ledsen till något att säga, har jag inte annan kopierar på DVD, eller CDEN, som jag kan ge till vänner till hjälp, kärnar ur.

used a translator for that so please forgive if that is not correct."
,Oojl,2005-04-18T20:24Z,"To lleb

I dont know if what you wrot was ment to me or some one else, but you can write in english and I´m prety shore we all will understand...becouse your translater is really really bad and it´s hard to understand what you meant...

Kind Regards Oojl"
,lleb,2005-04-18T20:48Z,sorry that the translator did not work well..  i was apologizing for the slow speed on the tracker.  sadly it is roughly 7G and i do not have copies on DVD or CD to pass around to a few of my friends to help seed.
,zypherus,2005-04-19T10:29Z,someone know how maney seasons there are going to be? 24 isent the end ;) need to watch them all over again :D
,Born_Insane,2005-04-19T18:24Z,Is there a reason why there are no seeders to this thing? We're about 80 who have 12.x% of it. 
,Cederwall,2005-04-20T19:04Z,Hur får man texten att fungera på avsnittet
,lleb,2005-04-20T21:40Z,Tonight I will be bringing the tracker down for a short bit so I can install a DVD burner into my system.  At that point I will burn a few DVDs and put the tracker up on a few other computers at different locations to help increase the speed of  this torrent.  I will bring it down sometime around 11pm EST.  It should not be down longer then 30min.  That is provided that windows does not decied to die on me for adding new hardware.
,lleb,2005-04-21T07:09Z,ok later then i had hopped...  i will have to get to it tomorrow.  tracker stays up tonight.  i will bring it down for a short bit tomorrow (wed. 4-21-05) for a short bit so I can install the DVD burner into that system.
,lleb,2005-04-23T04:06Z,"Ok, cross fingers.  This afternoon I tried to get the DVDs i burned to work at the other location.  got to love windows, it just froze up the system(s) i tried em on.  I just finished moving the data to my laptop.  I am now on my way back over to the 2nd location to copy the data from my laptop to their end and get the track up on a 2nd location.

best of luck to it."
,Miggs58,2005-04-23T09:36Z,"come on guys seed this please..
We're all stuk at 23 %
Damn good upload though - Thanks"
,courster,2005-04-23T12:06Z,Kan noen vær så snill og seed???  Det går jo så inmarig treg......
,lleb,2005-04-24T04:23Z,"Ok, that seems to be helping greatly.  enjoy a great set of episodes."
,lleb,2005-04-24T21:31Z,"odds are you will have to wait for them to all finish downloading before you can view any of them properly.  VLC should be able to handle things.

i view them all with linux and kaffeine, but i have used VLC to view them as test on my windows box."
,martinrodsjo,2005-04-25T15:00Z,"okey, tnx:)"
,brainx,2005-04-26T16:29Z,What format are these .avi files? DivX and AC3 or something else? The reason I'm asking is that I'm running them on a mac and I have no idea whatever it's the files or my viewer that needs a fix.
,RexManiac,2005-04-27T03:06Z,"När kommer nästa avsnitt?

When does the next episode come?"
,alfkod,2005-04-27T10:41Z,"Hey, someone that can continue seeding?i'm at 97,7 % Thanks a lot, great torrent btw!"
,ventilerik,2005-04-27T15:23Z,när kommer episode 21?
,wikkid,2005-04-27T16:55Z,"99,5 % - 0 seeders... annoying.... =("
,lleb,2005-04-27T21:23Z,"i am guessing DivX as i got all 20 episodes from this site.  all i did was use Azureus to creat a torrent of my entire directory.  i renamed all of the avi files into simpler to read and organize as some had very long names.

all 20 work just fine with VLC in windows and with xine or kaffeine in linux (if you have all of the codecs)  as for MAC i can only guess that you might need to find a codec that will play any of the other LOST torrents from this site.
"
,martinrodsjo,2005-04-28T23:21Z,is't downloading between 0kb/s and 2kb/s now...mostly 0:(
,PapiTuno,2005-04-29T01:07Z,"Lleb... Firstly, cheers for the posting and keeping it running for us all.
However, we seem to be getting tracker timeouts when attempting to connect.??"
,PapiTuno,2005-04-29T01:24Z,Back up and running!!! np M8.
,courster,2005-04-29T21:53Z,"Hey lleb or any others out there that can help me for that matter.....

I have the VLC media player and am attempting to watch another downloaded movie and the first few minutes work fine, but than it kicks me out.  The files are zipped, and the string for the file is: dvdrip.xvid-DIAMOND[bt-gm_EFnet] - - When I used Windows media player I get video but no sound.  I get both video and sound with VLC and improvement but it locks up.

I saw you had mentioned the xine working for your download but there were so many variations andor versions that I was uncertain which to dowload....

Help out the newby?  Thanks!"
