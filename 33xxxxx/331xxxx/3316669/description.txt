Found this album on Direct Connect and remembered I liked this band alot when I saw them way back in 1997 in Halmstad. They tore the place down and the show was fucking great! This is a pretty good punk/hardcore show recorded in Trollhättan, maybe not one of their best but defenetily one for the punk/hardcore fans out there. I think they were a straight edge/vegan band from Gislaved. I belive this is a pretty rare recordning cause I have never seen it shared before... ..but I might be wrong. It´s cool anyway. :D
