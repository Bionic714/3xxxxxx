,doublej,2005-04-11T07:47Z,"Problem ( probably only Mac ).
No sound on avi's when played in Quicktime player 6.5.2.
Anybody got any idea why / solution?
Cheers"
,doublej,2005-04-11T07:56Z,"a bit later!!
Sorted it out!
Quicktime player probably did not like this specific avi codec.
Used VLC and it plays beautifully!
Cheers"
