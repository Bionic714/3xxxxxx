Ok folks, here's another try with TND.
As before, all the usual subs - nordic - and probably a few more as well are there, as well as good sound quality - it being ripped by the lads in the WHO outfit as a guarantee for that.
Hope seeding works better this time, otherwise I'll have to go back to the drawing board again....
Also, ( hopefully ) " The world is not enough " can be found at this address:
