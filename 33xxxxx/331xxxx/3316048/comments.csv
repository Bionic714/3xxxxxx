,d98dany,2005-04-13T07:22Z,"No one who has the ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" with swedish subs and may share it?"
,Gpz900R,2005-04-13T08:15Z,I might have it burned on disc....I'll check and in that case rip it again and start sharing once TND has got enough seeders
,Gpz900R,2005-04-13T08:44Z,"OK, all the nordic subs are there, plus portugese, polish, magyar, dutch, turkish,french and two other subs I can't be sure of - probably greek and some arabian language.
It comes with complete menu, but as for the compression rate, I don't know since it wasn't me who ripped it in the first place, but rather the lads in the WHO outfit.
As for the pic&sound, my system says DD Ex and shows a pretty good picture ( Wide screen 100 Hz ), so that shouldn't be any problem."
