,mog,2005-04-01T17:04Z,"""Another exclusive rarity brought to you by RaySilko"" <<<--- Wrong! Someone was before you!

Look here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrents-details.php?id=3287639

""Quentin Tarantino's first released piece of cinema"" <<<--- Wrong again! The film was completed, but the final reel was destroyed in a lab fire that broke out during editing.

""As before, you will probably only find it here"" <<<--- And you are wrong again! I have seen this on other places, ever heard of Direct Connect and or FTP??

Thanx for uploading, but check your info before you write something."
