I want to be able to test out my HD projector but I need to get it onto a dvd disc to do that. My Divx/xvid/mpeg capable DVD player will not read it. Would reencoding it in DIVX ruin it??"

If it doesn't, you can resize the video to 720x576, for example, and that way your player would play it, but your HD projector would not show its best with this low resolution.

The best solution would be to hook up the HD projector to your PC, but don't know if that is possible in your case. And if it skips on your PC while playing, try the above mentioned codecs and try to enable the hardware acceleration in the Cyberlink codec if you have an ATI card.

Hope this helps."
