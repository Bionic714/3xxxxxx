,arnold113a,2005-04-13T08:59Z,"Astralia,

yours are the movies

This TV series here is totally different with different actors

Same story, same characters as in the films.

It's like Sean Connery and Roger Moore: same character (Bond) but different films  ;-)))"
,alphabeta404,2006-04-07T22:07Z,"Thanks, indeed it is one of the best made series of all times, the best for your effort"
,Perigee123,2008-04-28T21:18Z,"Arnold - just wanted to thank you for this series down - between you and the guy UL the Zatoichi series, you've given me a new lease on two of my favorite film series I thought I'd seen the last of."
,AskR,2008-07-09T11:40Z,More seeders! I'm stuck on 6%.
,fangs,2008-09-29T00:33Z,"this is a great series. a work of japanese art. samurai movies then were much better than now. for thows who wonder, death rate of bad guys is 1/min"
