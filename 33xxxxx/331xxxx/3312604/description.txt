<Impact size="1"><b>Gameplay :</b>

The gameplay controls are a little stiff and hard to get used to at first. Attacking enemies is simple because it auto aims on your target, and all you have to do is hold R, and tap A. 

Some of the puzzles are really challenging, sometimes too challenging. If you are smart enough, you'll figure out what items tocombine and such. Make sure you are aware that you can combine items, or else you'll be lost.

The actual level design is setup with very dark and creepy corridors, and you never know when an alien will jump out and tryto attack you. RLH is nerve-racking at times, especially if you are going to be playing this game late at night, by yourself.There is much more freedom to walk around in RLH than per se Resident Evil. On the ammo side, the developer took a niceapproach when creating this survival horror game, because you will always have enough ammo. A game like this is never funwhen you run out of ammo, and RLH won't let that happen. 

Hamlet quotes from Shakespeare are throughout the game. From the opening cinematics, and before every main level, you'llsee quotes. This essentially gives you a different feel for the game, and it's a nice approach.</font>
