,Hmmkk,2005-04-13T23:47Z,"It´s nice with torrents like this... 
BUT why do you put your tag on every torrent you upload here? 
You have NOTHING to do with the release but still you try to take the credit away from the team DAGGER, who are the real heroes around here. Also, learn to name folders/torrents properly..."
,TorrentWhore,2005-04-13T23:58Z,"I guess I´ll name my child (which is unfortunately going to be an ugly one if you'd ask me) Elitewebt3 :D

So many great releases and so early.. :P Keep it up, guys! *thumbs up* and you who upload them here also."
,koifish,2005-04-14T02:30Z,"shameless steal !!! give credit to DAGGER for DTRII AND Allstar for UTC2, wonder if these released are passworded as eliteweb did in the past... lame "
,lolfag,2005-04-14T06:05Z,"Geez, relax kiddies. It's not like this is the first time some p2p site retagged releases. Get over it and stop whining."
,satanas,2005-04-15T13:28Z,"NOT WORKING!!!
This seams to be a none working release.
The game will not boot iether form the dvd or the harddrive.
Is it only me who had this problem?"
,Linghult,2005-04-16T16:58Z,"yeah, elitewebt sucks....  they set password on the rars and when u gonna get the pass u discover that the site is on SPANISH! so its kinda hard to get an account and get the pass  from their forum. im not downloading from them, thats for sure"
,PeteJ,2005-04-18T11:23Z,Funkar hur bra som helst. Inga problem från HDD eller från skiva.
,PeteJ,2005-04-18T11:26Z,And In English: This works for me. Both from hardrive and disc.
,SinQ,2005-04-23T14:52Z,"hur bränner jag ut den här på en dvd-r? min dator verkar inte tolka filerna som .rar-filer. vilket inte är så konstigt då det bara är .001 till .021 och en .svf fil. om jag skulle lägga den på xboxen så borde ju inte det funka heller.

english: how do i burn this on a dvd-r? it dosent look like .rar-files."
,SinQ,2005-04-23T14:56Z,"nu fattar jag. man måsste öppna winrar och därifrån öppna .001 som ett rararkiv.

english: it works if you open winrar and from there opens .001 as an rararchive."
,krazz,2005-04-27T23:41Z,Are some of you haveing fucked up graphics on some levels?
,gordobot77,2005-05-03T23:08Z,"Yeah, the Gfx go blurry in some parts on some levels, and always blurry on ""instant action"".
Think it's stuffed!!"
,vacuuum,2006-05-20T05:06Z,can someone seed so we can all just let this torrent die? only 6 people on the same % of completion (includes me ofcourse =P)
