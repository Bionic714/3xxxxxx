,bensagi,2008-09-02T11:40Z,"Hi, I am a newbie in using cakewalk.  I have cakewalk sonar 4.0 producer edition. The problem is I need a manual or tutorial to get a kickstart. I hear that cakewalk is a good recording software.  Where can I download an electronic manual in English?  Or can someone email me a copy? My email is ben4518@gmail.com. 

Would appreciate very much if you guys can lend me some help.
