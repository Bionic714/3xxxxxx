,OldiezMaDDoG,2005-04-22T02:17Z,"1. Create a image of your GT4 DVD using DVDdecrypter

2. Start apache.exe - open the image you just created (file --> open )- Right click on the IMG file in the left window and extract all. ! Save on c: ! *

3. Start apache.exe - open the same file as above - Right click on the IMG file in the left window and change layer. Extract the singel file on the other layer to the same directory as above.

4. Unpack this zip and overwrite all files in (c:GRANTURISMO4)* move gt4_hdd.iml and gt4_hdd.ims to c:
	 If you have used any other directory or HDD you have to change the path in the file gt4_hdd.iml using a text editor
	 so it points to the right path and file. RECOMENDED USING THE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE SUGGESTED

5. Now use gdvd4-iml2iso.exe to create a new ISO. Click the dots (....) open the gt4_hdd.iml then click start. Wait and then you will have a 5,25Gb file.

6. Copy the new file gt4_hdd.iso to your ps2 

7. Have fun.

* When i used DvDDecrypter it automaticly created the directory GRANTURISMO4 on my c: drive."
,OldiezMaDDoG,2005-04-25T05:37Z,"This one realy works, did it to my ps2 no problems at all. Only problem was that the iml2iso didn't start om my comp. And it took a while to find a newer version that worked."
,vwgti16v,2005-07-12T15:20Z,Well this almost work :-P How do I create an image of my GT4 dvd when the torrent file I have downloaded from here is on my harddrive? And in apache I can`t open any IMG file because I can`t find it next to the other file in my GT4 folder
