,Smuffer,2007-06-25T21:21Z,"download daemon tools, then mount the .bin or .cue file

you then run the CD from there, but I still don't have a cdkey, anyone have one?"
,mrspock09,2007-06-26T19:52Z,"thanks Smuffer, and theres no keygen in here! any1 kno where i can get one?"
,lyndaek,2007-07-02T21:57Z,i burnt the cue file (just the cue file) onto cd and presto it worked. if you ignore the autorun and go to the root folder of the CD the keygen is there in a folder called crack. its really not rocket science.
,ownr_alex,2007-07-14T23:23Z,"Open it with the program PowerISO and mount the image, then extract the files and use the keygen in the extracted folder called crack."

,StingerSM,2011-07-15T21:07Z,"The torrent is good so good job to the uploader.  However this program sucks, and be advised that if you install on a 64 bit system by running in combatibility mode, it will be a royal PITA to uninstall.  Do not install on 64 bit system.  Other programs are better for editing."
