game x copy v1.08 

GAMESXCOPY lets you make a PERFECT backup copy of virtually any PC Game. GAMESXCOPY is a powerful utility and all you need is a PC with either a CD or a DVD burner. No more threat of losing a game due to theft, scratches, skipping, freezing or other media imperfections. Your copy works just like the original; your entire collection can be archived and your investment protected. 
Either use a blank disc or write the entire game to your hard disc drive. Imagine the possibilities of playing a game without needing the original disc. 

How GAMESXCOPY works: 

GAMESXCOPY does not change any of the original game content. GAMESXCOPY creates an exact image of your PC game. GAMESXCOPY then uses exclusive AUTO-BURN technology to transfer the image onto a CD or DVD. Once backed up, you can store your original PC game safe on the shelf and then either play your game from your hard drive or from the backup disc.
