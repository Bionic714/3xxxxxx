<p>'Live in Italy' is the long awaited first official live release from Cranes. Recorded in October 2002 in Italy (plus Holland and Austria) during their Future Songs tour, 'Live in Italy' captures the true essence of the Cranes live performances, covering tracks over the past 13 years of their career.
<p><i>"abstractly beautiful, inexplicably affecting chords, ..., 'Live in Italy' begins with chilly suggestion and climaxes in white-hot emoting. Atmospheres which make your hair stand on end..." (Uncut).</i>
