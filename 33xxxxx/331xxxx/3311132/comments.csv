,CaptainPerverto,2007-08-25T19:08Z,"Why did they even release an uncensored version? About all that's different is you can take a chunk off a dead VC's chest, which looks like shit anyway. No blood splatters, haven't seen one limb come off, and the most I've heard said as far as language goes is ""gook"". It sure as fuck isn't worth buying, and I'm not even sure if it's worth downloading."
,Raep-FIN,2008-09-23T18:50Z,"This is worth downloading, but when I click the cracked v1.60 game launcher .exe, configure settings and click ok... 

(Waiting a minute...)

...lolwtf nothing happens. Did I miss something important?"
,Raep-FIN,2008-09-23T19:02Z,"my computer is 2800mhz, xp pro sp3, 0.992gb of ram, 33,554,432 bytes of video ram and directx 9.0c.

Seems to be enough. Or does this game need somekind of a pixel shader? I need an answer."
,Raep-FIN,2008-09-23T19:22Z,"Installation information:

1. Mount Vc UE CD1.iso in Daemon tools.

2. Choose Installation. If nothing shows up try to autoplay the virtual drive where the .iso is mounted in.

3. Choose your install settings and proceed to install.

4. At 50% it asks for a CD2. Right-click Daemon tools tray icon and replace/""re-mount"" the CD1.iso to CD2.iso. The install continues.

5. When you're finished with the install process click on quit and go to patches+crack-folder located in the place where you d/l:ed this torrent. Click on patch v1.30. Install it. Do the same thing to patch v1.41. But DO NOT install patch v1.60!!!!! 

6. UnRAR the ""dev-v160"" WinRAR archive. Open the ""dev-v160""-folder, replace the original game .exe with the v1.60 crack.

7. Enjoy the game if it starts after the setup. Still need an answer."
,Raep-FIN,2008-09-23T19:26Z,"Aaahhhaaaaaahhh..... nothing anymore. :):):):)

Got it working using 640x480 resolution. Fuck I hate my Silicon integrated Systems graphics card.. hehe."
,Raep-FIN,2008-09-23T20:25Z,"heheheh. :P

breaking news, pirates.

I found out that you can use patch 1.60 after 1.41 and then use the crack.

sorry. I'm feeling tired thats all. hmh.."
,GrevGamasj,2008-11-01T00:31Z,"Ok, JUST to be kind with you guys.

Update to Raep-FIN's guide, which works PERFECT.

You need Daemon Tools.

Remember to mount both cd's at the same time, by choosing two disks.

Then it DOES NOT stop at 50 % !

And another IMPORTANT aspect - for you guys who get ""wrong disc inserted"" - in the rar file with the crack, its a vietcong guy - the .exe file. It's just named vietcong.

Go in C /  program files / Vietcong folder - and  REPLACE the old, green vietcong launch file, by deleting it, with the new ""red"" vietcong guy you got from your rar file.

It's easy !

Happy gaming - and this game is the BEST I've ever tried - I've tried alot !

(Not getting daemon to work? Feel free to ask me questions @ vckiller_nor@hotmail.com - but google it first !) 

So guide:

Installation information:

1. Mount Vc UE CD1.iso AND CD2 at the same time in Daemon tools. Then it won't stop at 50 %.

2. Choose setup in the folder. If nothing shows up try to autoplay the virtual drive where the .iso is mounted in.

3. Choose your install settings and proceed to install.

5. When you're finished with the install process click on quit and go to patches+crack-folder located in the place where you d/l:ed this torrent. Click on patch v1.30. Install it. Finish. Do the same thing to patch v1.41. Then install patch 1.60.

6. UnRAR the ""dev-v160"" WinRAR archive. Replace the old vietcong.exe file in C / Programfiles / Vietcong folder with the Vietcong crack from this rar file

7. Enjoy the game if it starts after the setup - which it will if mounted properly, and if vietcong.exe is replaced with correct crack!

Happy gaming - as I  said."

I had no problems downloading it and it is the best game i ever downloaded thank you for the GREAT upload it Wess122 :). Oh and guys, if you cant play the game then you HAVE TO patch the game up to 1.60 or else it will not work and + you have to replace the vietcong.exe with the crack one so you can play the game. "

,FrAgA,2009-04-10T04:19Z,"dude,its just about using virtualclonedrive and play man....why spend on a cd....XD"
,Sachaztan,2009-05-26T20:09Z,"Just love how retarded some things get when you play on the Vietnam difficulty level.

The best example is the first map you see action in. There's a ""sniper"" (it's really a loinclothed farmer with WW2 bolt action). 

Now this guy can HS you from several hundred meters without a scope THE SECOND you stick your head out just a little too much. And when you lie in cover and peek up a little bit you can see him hitting the exact same spot, on the centimeter, over and over again right next to your head. Strafing him? Forget it, he can lead the shot even from several hundred meters with reflexes that would make a praying mantis look slow. And for some reason he ignores the other two soldiers that are with you because somehow he knows that YOU are the only one capable of hurting him. And lets not forget about how fast he fires! With his rate of fire a mere human couldn't aim for shit and just throw away the shots in the enemies general direction but he is just as accurate despite frantically pulling the bolt action so fast it would burn the metal. In a marksmanship competition vs an Olympic marksman with a ultra modern semi-automatic scoped sniper he would win.

But you can kill him. Either you crawl all the way (for some reason it's practically impossible for him to hit you when you crawl or lie down, which is weird because IRL you want to move as fast as you can OR stay in cover NOT make yourself a perfect target by slowly moving along) until you can get a clear shot and then shoot him in the head, or come close enough to scare him away, in which case you must have unnerved him or something because then he doesn't aim even nearly as good...


Imao it's a good game and still playable despite being so old, but it's lame that they couldn't make an ultra hard difficulty setting without making the uneducated,, undernourished, desperate loin-clothed farmers into cyber imba robots with x-ray vision and pwnage"
,callmethespacecowboy,2009-07-27T03:00Z,"installation and everything went smoothly. but its bugged like nothing i have ever seen. my player only moves in reverse....
