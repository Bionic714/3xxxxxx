,Weeper,2005-04-13T22:55Z,Kan disse brukes til Qtek 8020 Mobil Telefon?
,ultrasoul,2005-04-14T15:07Z,"Sry man. Min svenska = hopleless. This package was geared towards owners of PDAs who have Windows Mobile 2003 and 2003SE installed. If you have other OS like the Smartphone edition of WM2002 installed, you may try downloading the appropriate trial programs off the manufacturers' websites and register them using the same serial included (usually, the serials for a program work for all editions of PocketPC apps)"

,ihatethefeds,2008-06-21T05:26Z,"Yo, thanks for the upload.  Uno Problemo though, the pocket hack master is not working. What I mean is, I tap and tap and tap yet again on that stupid icon, but nothing happens, not even an error message pops up. I installed it from the cab file (copied cab to PPC and installed it from file explorer). Am I doing sometin wrong? Do I have to crack it befo using it or what? I really need that program. Thanks for your help. -Fedhater2008"
