,Corelian,2005-04-07T19:23Z,A guess: redbook audio (?)
,Nerzul,2005-04-08T15:57Z,"i think the reason for the ISO beeing so big is because this version contains a extra game named ""Kings Bounty"" or something."
,Corelian,2005-04-08T16:41Z,"Ha, ha! Thats funny! I doubt that King's Bounty takes hundreds of MBs of space, but guess you know better since I haven't finished downloading yet.

Thanks for sharing anyway."
,Corelian,2005-04-09T18:23Z,The cue-sheet is broken. Any chance of getting a working one?
,Nerzul,2005-04-09T21:03Z,if you use the bin file it will work
,Nerzul,2005-04-09T21:06Z,if you emulate the bin file it will work
,Corelian,2005-04-09T22:48Z,I don't really understand what you are trying to say. I said the cue-sheet is invalid and I would like to get A PROPER CUE-SHEET.
,Nerzul,2005-04-10T02:45Z,i have now uploaded a second version to my Heroes torrent with the cue-sheet problem fixed.
,Kandersen,2005-04-10T12:01Z,"so what you're saying is i have to re-download it?

,Legend86,2005-04-20T00:39Z,hmm nä det crashar i striderna. förjävligt
,Legend86,2005-04-20T00:47Z,"funkade när jag stängde av ljudeffekterna och musiken. konstigt.. troligvis min dator.

men men spelet funkar i alla fall fin fint på xp om du gör så.

glömde att säga att jag ställde spelet på kompatibel läge till win 95. 

fast jag säger bara om ni vill spela det riktigt installera win 98.

fast om ni inte orka så kan ni ju göra som jag skrev"
,Cymes82,2006-05-24T05:25Z,"The cue file is not a problem.
Just get yourself cuemaker , then you can easily create new & working .cue"
,Neivler,2006-11-02T20:17Z,"I found a way to play HOMM1 on Win XP. 


Just run Help and Suport, and chose fixing a problem. 


Then you take application and software problems. 


Then take Getting older programs to run on Windows XP and start the Program Compatibility Wizard. 


So now you have to use deamontool and emulate the bin file(maby the cue work to, but not on my pc). 


And when you come to How do you want to locate the program that you would like to run with compatibility settings? Just take the cd-rom(or find the stetup fil in the cd). 


The nwxt chose 95, and after tat just take the 256 colors and Disable visual themes. 


The will it work, but the stetup will say not resopnsing, but close that windov and you sudenly come to the steut and it will work properly;) 


Any questions just send me a mail an I will anser.
