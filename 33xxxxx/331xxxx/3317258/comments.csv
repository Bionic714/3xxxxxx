,watwegsw,2005-04-15T20:19Z,"oh, but you have to add ""asiantorrents"" in your first entry, or else it wont be shown under asiantorrents :(

,gogojpn,2007-04-02T12:54Z,the subtitles arent working... well in my own ?_? i'm lost
,KainAbyss,2007-06-17T09:32Z,"lol the hand cut off is the most funny thing i've ever seen in my whole life, great scene!!!"
,axiom602,2007-06-27T23:10Z,Could anyone tell me how to sub this?
,robach,2007-09-27T18:45Z,"Rename the sub file to Suicide.Club.2002.DVDRip.XviD-SCANiA.srt and will  work. You see BhangWalla forgot to put ""SCANiA"" when he renamed it."
,zytar,2008-11-22T06:53Z,"At first I couldn't watch it right, I couldn't make the subtitles to appear until I installed that VobSub, everything worked well..

I find the manga more easier to comprehend compared to the movie but, still was a good watch..(?)"
,Chibi-Chan,2009-01-30T03:51Z,"Okay, I hate to sound entirely stupid, but I haven't really attempted to burn something like this to a DVD, so would anyone please tell me how to burn it to a DVD with Nero 9?

Thanks.  I've been wanting to watch this so badly!"
,descendfromgrace,2009-02-03T20:39Z,"@ Chibi-Chan: its really easy if you use these programs: 1st http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4537411/ConvertXtoDVD_3.3.0.96_And_Keygen_%5B1337x%5D

2nd http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4537699/PowerISO_4.3-KEYGEN_INCLUDED%5B%5Bmegadroid%5D%5D

to make this a lot easier make a new folder on your desktop titled ""next to burn"" and go into convertxtodvd options and copy and paste that as the working folder.

convertxtodvd is great at encoding and converting but sucks for burning so go to options and tell it NOT to burn when conversion is complete. poweriso is amazing for burning so you open that and drag the audio_TS and video_ts folders from your next to burn file into power iso. tell it to burn and your off.

there are tons of options in convertxtodvd for various backgrounds and adding subtitles anp such is a few easy clicks so feel free to play with the options for the first few dvds. 

one final tip is to burn as slow as you can. slower speeds give less chance of burning errors.

good luck! "
