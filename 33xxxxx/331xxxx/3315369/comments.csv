,Wayward,2005-06-25T06:13Z,"This game is very difficult to make run on XP. Try installing to fat32 partition, or using dosbox."
,PerkaErka,2005-07-03T17:26Z,"Ja mins när ja satt och spelade de här hemma hos en kompis, fy fan va rolit ja hadde satt o spelade minst 15h om dagen, jag personligen tycker att daggerfall är ett roligare spel än uppföljaren morrowind!"

,LostWarrior103,2006-02-28T20:48Z,Do I have to have the original cd to install and play this?
,Red_Ninja,2006-03-01T18:07Z,"How do you install this game? It keeps asking for a cd, which I can't seem to find in the torrent."
,judas10,2006-03-06T01:33Z,"While we're waiting for ES4 - Oblivion :D 

Thanks to the uploader and the seeders, good job."
,Ericzeppe52,2006-04-03T18:27Z,"Man borde egentligen skaffa en 15 tums skärm bara för att spelet ska se bra ut.

Man borde ge ut de första två elder scrolls spelen på nytt med högupplöst grafik nu när det är 10-årsdagen. Westwood gjorde nått liknande med C&C"

,Tibi007,2006-07-18T00:45Z,"Elmon 88! You should mount the file: Daggerfall, with Demontools, and after that start install."

,kraset,2008-01-22T19:41Z,"A wonderful game. One of the best RPGs I ever played. This is partly because of the extremely nice music that adds such a great atmosphere to the game.

I have converted those old MIDI files to MP3 songs, using first class sampled orchestral instruments from the Nexus VST, through Cubase. You will find quite a few of these old Daggerfall songs here:
http://www.4shared.com/account/dir/4555448/2a1f058b/sharing.html

Go to the Nexus subdirectory, and there you will find the Daggerfall music.

Hail to the original composer of Daggerfall!"
,fleebiscuit,2008-05-10T07:40Z,"Okay, I'm not exactly skilled with DosBox, but everytime I try to run this it says it can't find the CD, even though I installed it to run without the CD.
Any ideas on what I should do?"
,fleebiscuit,2008-05-10T12:32Z,"Okay, I think I pretty much tried everything possible except the right thing, so if anyone can right a little tutorial, semi-detailed, it'd be appreciated."
,wheybags,2009-01-03T04:25Z,"@ toyotomi, click on my username, and you will find a redguard torrent with instructions to install and play."
,Anarith,2009-01-04T13:19Z,"i installed the game, installer says installation succesfull. i run the game and a black screen with a red big flashing underscore pops up like i have to enter something, i can't enter anything and nothing happens, only is seems that the red underscore changes color a bit, btw i have winxp sp3

,Anarith,2009-01-04T13:39Z,"i tried compatibility win2000, 98/me. now i get some text with the flashing cursor underneath it, it says daggerfall is now loading but nothing happens,"
,GuitarGod420,2009-03-19T20:07Z,Please Help Me I Cant Install It Keeps Asking For CD Source!! Help
,EvilPirater,2009-10-03T02:33Z,"Seriously, I can't believe this:
""Do I have to have the original CD to install and play this?""

If you had the original CD you would have bought the fuckin game you twat, completely defeating the purpose of pirating. 

Oh and this as well:
""How do you install this game? It keeps asking for a cd, which I can't seem to find in the torrent.""
Well, you can't find the damn CD because it is an object! Objects, do not exist virtually in a machine you idiot. You know I'm just going to stop reading comments if so many thicko's d'ld torrents. I mean that is priceless, do you need the original CD to install?! God I'll be laughing at that for weeks to come! 
Jeez..."
,De_loused,2009-10-30T18:11Z,one advice... If you mastered the art of mounting images and playing games for fre... dont read the comments section.
,De_loused,2009-10-30T19:58Z,"Excellent torrent, downloaded in 20 minutes. Installed without problem using daemon tool. It works good on Xp tho youll have to turn the Sound Hardware acceleration off but it supports 1024X768.

Only 1 problem: All the NPCs are on Steroids i mean they act on a normal time basis, but its like they're in their own timeframe lol. 
Is there anybody anywhere in the world who would have a solution for that, to slow down the AI response (for any old games not just Daggerfall)."
,De_loused,2009-10-30T20:13Z,"Oh and btw... for the sakes of the rare helpless people who might read this.

If you have Windows XP, download a program named ''daemon tools lite'' (it creates a virtual CD drive, your computer makes no difference between it and the real CD). Right click on it in your task bar, Mount Image (mount the Daggerfall Image you just downloaded)

2 options:
*1: Unpack the Iso file into ''C:\Dagger\CD'' (create folder) install (path- C:\Daggerfall), download ''Dosbox''. run Dosbox and type (exactly): -''mount c c:\Daggerfall''
-''mount d c:\Dagger\CD -t cdrom''
-''C:''
-''cd Dagger''
- you should now be in C:\Dagger\... now type in ''Dagger''

The game should run.
Solution 2: Mount with daemon tools, DO NOT install with the autorun just exit. Go back in the folder you downloaded and run the Installer (DF Install or sumthing like that)

Game should run on windows no problem, you might have issues with the sound (Game freezes for several seconds, dialogues and movies are poorly or not played at all, bug wich wasnt even fixed in TES 4 Oblivion).
In this case, make sure you have the latest driver for your sound card. If still shitty: go to control panel / multimedia / audio /performances /audio. Turn off the hardware acceleration. (this solves the problem with TES 3 and 4)

PS. My geekness comes without tip :) enjoy Daggerfall it is truly epic... even after playing the 2 sequels and their expansions i still feel like they were not enough like daggerfall."
,florgflorg,2009-12-23T18:49Z,"doesn't work with windows 7 x64 ultimate.  mounted using magic disk, ran dfinstall, did the compatibility troubleshoot from xp sp3 to win95, ran both as and not administrator, and used all the compatibility checkbox options...doesn't work for windows 7 x64 ultimate, but maybe another OS"
,aTOMBBOMb,2010-01-07T00:58Z,"Daggerfall is now free along with the original game, Arena from bethesda's elder scrolls site

so, no need for a torrent anymore"
,gard815,2010-06-09T17:05Z,it was something wrong about the patch's. tis torrent dosen't work to me :P
,serenity3212,2011-01-24T02:56Z,"awesome it's downloading fast, i love the advice above I'll tell you how it plays.  
If bethesda still has a free download someone shoot a link because I'm looking. Thanks so much for seeding, i have looked for this game for years in the stores and just got into downloading unavailable stuff from the web thank you so much!"
,serenity3212,2011-01-24T03:47Z,somebody tell me why jzip won't unpack this for me? I suck at this technical stuff.
,serenity3212,2011-01-24T03:49Z,whoa daemon tools is cool.
,serenity3212,2011-01-24T04:21Z,I'm hopeless
