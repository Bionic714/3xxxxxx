,HenL,2005-04-10T06:40Z,Heroes of Might and Magic 1 right? Not HoMM 2?
,Corelian,2005-04-10T10:23Z,"Thank you for this. Resuming doesn't seem to work. Well, have to download the whole thing again."
,parkanyi2,2005-04-11T08:42Z,"HOMM 1 was released in 1995, how could that be 1 full CD? I think it's HOMM 2. :) Anyway, a big thanks for the release, both are classics! :)"
,Nerzul,2005-04-11T12:28Z,"just to make it clear. It IS the first Heroes games.
the reason it is so big is because the cd i ripped it from was a multi session disk wich included audio files, wich makes the iso so big."
,Corelian,2005-04-11T16:36Z,"parkanyi2: A lot of older CD-games used redbook audio, thus the CD-images are pretty large, while the data track(s) may have been small in size. But it's also pretty stupid to claim that old games would have been smaller than recent games. In the early days of CD-games the video and audio copression methods were quite poor compared to today's technology. That's why the first FMV-games were quite large, e.g. Phantasmagoria (1995) spanned 7 CDs!"
,parkanyi2,2005-04-12T13:03Z,"Ok, I was not clear in my post. As I recall HOMM 1 took like 1.5 megs zipped. Anyway, it's a must have and thanks again for sharing, now I will have the audio tracks as well! :)"
,Corelian,2005-04-14T09:01Z,"Thanks for sharing, but you could have mentioned that this is the WIN95 VERSION of the game! And it doesn't work in DOS like you stated in the previous torrent's comments!"
,Nerzul,2005-04-15T02:34Z,i'm terribly sorry for that. will never happen again
,stianhh,2005-06-22T11:47Z,seed please?
,Neivler,2006-11-02T20:17Z,"I found a way to play HOMM1 on Win XP. 

Just run Help and Suport, and chose fixing a problem.

Then you take application and software problems.

Then take Getting older programs to run on Windows XP and start the Program Compatibility Wizard.

So now you have to use deamontool and emulate the bin file(maby the cue work to, but not on my pc).

And when you come to How do you want to locate the program that you would like to run with compatibility settings? Just take the cd-rom(or find the stetup fil in the cd).

The nwxt chose 95, and after tat just take the 256 colors and Disable visual themes.

The will it work, but the stetup will say not resopnsing, but close that windov and you sudenly come to the steut and it will work properly;)

Any questions just send me a mail an I will anser.

,StranD^,2006-12-22T16:10Z,thx for guide! :D
,chyron8472,2007-01-27T01:16Z,"erm...

Compatibility issues?

I had no compatibility issues. This game works just fine. "
,chyron8472,2007-01-27T01:18Z,"oh, and it's Heroes 1.
1. as in 0ld sk00l. there are 5 now... of course it was made for win95/98. 

still, it works just fine for me."
,chrolle,2007-02-25T00:38Z,"All i get when downloaded is 2 vlc-files...:S im kind of a noob in this area, wht am i supose to do?"
,jensholmgren77,2007-09-03T13:29Z,"This is a rather old torrent, so I expect no answers to this one:
The ""Track01.wav"" for the CD-sound is missing. I gues thats the problem causing the craches deskribed in version 1 of this torrent. I can play for a while but with the sound displaced when entering objekts and stuff.
There is a differens in size between ver. 1 (659.48 MiB) and this one (659.14 MiB), mayde ""Track01.wav"" exist there?
It is hard to say for me since no one is seeding it any more. 

Do any one outthere have the ""Track01.wav""? or maby the ver. 1 of this torrent?"
,Space_Cat,2008-03-25T13:34Z,"Hey Nerzul.
Could you please remake the bin file? The reason is that the audio music does'nt work.

Alternative please seed the bin from version 1.
Please!!!

There's no sense in downloading this if the audio does'nt work. You could just download a 150 mb iso instead...."
,xorxo,2008-03-27T18:22Z,"Space_Cat, what are you talking about? I burned the image to a cdr disk and cd music plays fine. Did you burn it on an actual cd-r or just mounted with Daemon tools? - because it probably doesnÂ´t work with virtual drive if it is not the highest letter optical drive."
,Space_Cat,2008-03-28T13:11Z,"I've mounted it with alcohol. I'll try burning it and see if there's any difference. The problem is that while playing the game with audio music, the game crashes with an ""CD MUSIC ERROR"". I'll try it again and write exactly what it say...

I think that jensholmgren77 is referring to the same problem..."
,Space_Cat,2008-03-28T15:48Z,"Just remembered that I've deleted the files because I could not get the audio to work. So have to download again.

And guess what ;)
Seems that nobody is seeding anymore :("
,xorxo,2008-03-28T20:18Z,"I set it to seed again :)

And update about the cd music error: What I discovered, is that on another computer I also got the cd music error (plays cd music until end of turn or exit of city and then gets an error) - I had some kind of Heroes 1 Installed on that computer before. But on the pc where I installed this for the first time - it worked flawlessly with the cd music. Both are Win XP machines, maybe it works on one because the non-previous install thing or maybe it has something to do with different DVD-RW drives, or maybe even something else.."
,Space_Cat,2008-04-01T13:47Z,"Hey.

Thanks for seeding ;)

I can confirm your findings. The problem is still there on my desktop but installed the game on my laptop and it worked perfectly.
First it also worked on the desktop but after an uninstall and fresh install got the same errors as before.

So the game works on computers where it hasn't been installed before which is unbelievable but true!!

Also noticed the audio is out of sync. This is especially noticeable when your hero is going up a level or visiting a peasent's hut. At first no sound but after a few seconds some ""random"" sound. Listen to the 8-bit audio and notice the sounds are definetly not the same...

I'll do some further testing when i've got some more spare time :)"
