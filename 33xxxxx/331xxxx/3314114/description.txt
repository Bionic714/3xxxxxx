Very Special Thanks: Aaron B'Y, Andre R'Z (Surnames partially omitted for privacy reasons; you should know who you are ;-) ); for being some of the people who indirectly introduced me to, & played a major role in getting me fascinated in, the Power Rangers, from 1994 September 14 through 1997 June 12.
