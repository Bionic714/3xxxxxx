 ?  sensor cable designed by the Viper Team. Thanks guys you made it easy   ?
 ?  with your foresight, for us to make the Cobra BIOS swapless. Don't      ?
 ?  mess with the disc & lid anymore. Turn on your console and play.        ?
 ?                                                                          ?

 ?  - A lot of fixes and low-level changes                                  ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?  A Swap disc option was left in (called "Change Disc" as you could also  ?
 ?  replace a backup with another backup) to be totally backward            ?
 ?  compatible. Read more below                                             ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?  USER MANUAL                                                             ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?   - If you want to use full-size DVD-R you can remove the top of the     ?
 ?     console. Team Xtender will be releasing replacement lids compatible  ?
 ?     with full DVD-R within two week. Best of all, we learned this week   ?
 ?     that they will be officially Viper GC branded!                       ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?   - Flash the Viper GC with this BIOS then remove the parallel port      ?
 ?     connector from the programmer. If you prefear you can flash this     ?
 ?     BIOS from DVD if you have Cobra 0.3+ already running on your chip.   ?
 ?     We've heard Viper Team will release an USB programmer for the chip   ?
 ?     soon if you prefear USB.                                             ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?   - Turn on your GC with the disc you want to run. It can be an          ? 
 ?     original or a backup, but if it's a backup it should be filled with  ? 
 ?     1.3GB of data at least (for now). If you have a black screen coming, ?
 ?     it's probably beause your Viper installation is not clean.           ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?   - While turning on your GC:                                            ?
 ?        - Hold Y to go to Main Menu (if it's not your Default Boot mode)  ?
 ?        - Hold X for the other boot mode (can be set in Config Menu)      ?
 ?        - Don't hold anything for Default Boot Action                     ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?   - Select "Direct Disc Boot" if you want to play a backup or homebrew   ?
 ?     program from DVD. If you have problems using the Direct Disc Boot    ? 
 ?     method with your media, you can still use the Swap trick.            ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?   - If you want to use the old Swap Trick Method (for discs that are     ?
 ?     not full or that have problems to sync with the Direct Disc Boot)    ?
 ?     boot your GC with an original disc. Then choose the "Change Disc"    ?
 ?     option and follow the instructions. After the swap is done, you      ?
 ?     can select Direct Disc Boot option again.                            ? 
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?   - Select "Original BIOS" if you want to play an original Game          ?
 ?     compatible with your GC region, or if you want to go into the        ?
 ?     Original BIOS menus.                                                 ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?   - Select "Configuration Menu" if you want to change your Cobra BIOS    ?
 ?     configuration. The options are quite self-explanatory.               ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?   - Select "Disc Explorer" to enter to browse the content or your        ?
 ?     original GC discs or DVDs. Supported file systems are FST            ?
 ?     (GC File System) and ISO9660. Joliet encoding is not supported in    ? 
 ?     ISO mode.                                                            ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?   - Enter "Cheat codes" to select, enable, disable and edit cheat codes  ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?   - Enter "Disc Explorer" to select a game from a MultiBoot disc         ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?   - Enter "Disc Explorer" and select a .VGC file if you want to reflash  ?
 ?     your Viper GC without the need of the Parallel port programmer!      ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?   - Enter "Disc Explorer" and select a .DOL file if you want to run      ?
 ?     a homebrew program! (You can put up to 1.4 GB of homebrew things on  ?
 ?     a disc. We hope this will give some inspiration to emu authors :-)   ?
 ?     Our DOL loader is not perfect for now and works for around half of   ?
 ?     the public homebrew programs. Here are some of the programs booting  ?
 ?     successfully:                                                        ?
 ?     GC-Linux, Ascii Fighter, DVD Browser, CTR_GCS, CTR_SND, GBQ Gameboy  ?
 ?     emulator, PSOLoader "It's working" demo, Maze, Nitrorally,  Yeti 3D  ?
 ?     3D engine, Chip8 emulator, Snowlords game, Terranigma, XRick and     ?
 ?     probably many we missed!                                             ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?   - Enter "Disc Explorer" and select a .VGC file if you want to reflash  ?
 ?     your Viper GC without the need of the Parallel port programmer!      ?

 ?   - Enter "Disc Explorer" and select a .COD file if you want to add      ?

 ?   - Make sure that the "lid passthru" wires of the Viper GC are          ?
 ?     installed correctly or the disc won't spin. 
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?                                                                          ?

 ?  THE MEDIA                                                               ?

 ?  The GC drive in its default state only eats high-quality DVD-R and      ?
 ?  a few MINI-DVD-R. But a couple of weeks ago, speedi from the afterdawn  ?
 ?  forums found a nice way to tweak the laser so it reads almost any burned?
 ?  media including some DVD+Rs. We recommend doing this laser tweak if you ?
 ?  have any problems reading your DVDs. We are no laser experts, in fact   ?
 ?  we think it would be more appropriate to just lower the value of the    ?
 ?  variable resistor instead of setting it to an absoulte given value,     ?
 ?  but lots of people including us have been using this laser tweek for a  ?
 ?  couple of weeks without any problem reported so far.                    ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?  You don't need to encrypt the disc or use a special burner firmware     ?
 ?  to write the disc. Just burn your ISO/GCM (rename it to .ISO) with      ?
 ?  Nero (or any other tool).                                               ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?  CHEAT CODES                                                             ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?  If you want to use cheat codes, enter Cheat Codes menu,select a game,   ?
 ?  check the codes you want to use, exit the cheat selector and enable     ?
 ?  cheats.                                                                 ?

 ?  To add new codes follow on-screen instructions. The codes are           ?
 ?  compatible with decrypted AR codes. You can decrypt AR codes using      ?
 ?  the great GCNCrypt by Parayste. Never enter the first code of a given   ?

 ?  - If the disc stops spinning in the menu it means that the drive can't  ?
 ?    sync with your media, or that there are not enough data on your disc. ?
 ?    In direct boot mode the GC is very selective about the media it       ?
 ?    takes. If you have any problem please try the swap trick. If you      ?
 ?    still have problems try with different media/burner. Make sure your   ?
 ?    laser is correctly tweaked!                                           ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?  - Audio Streaming: Some games use a special audio streaming mode        ?
 ?    that can be compared to CDDA. For now, the ISO of the file needs to   ?
 ?    be patched with 0rbital's great ViperTemporaryAudioFix 1.1+. If the   ?
 ?    ISO is not patched you'll have noise instead of music. We will try to ?
 ?    fix this issue so no patching is required. But in case we do, YOUR    ?
 ?    PATCHED ISOS WILL BE FULLY COMPATIBLE and still work with music!      ?
 ?    (so forget what is written in the fixer nfo file). Don't run the fix  ?
 ?    on ISOs that don't need fixing as it will only destroy them :-)       ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?  - Most multi-discs games are working, just play with Disc 1 until       ?
 ?    you're asked to change disc and make a save here. Then boot with      ?
 ?    Disc 2 instead. We started working on code to allow disc-change,      ?
 ?    and we'll integrate it in a new release.                              ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?  All those problems could be fixed in a next update.                     ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?  Before burning an image, makes sure it is 1459978240 bytes long else    ?
 ?  you may need to use the swap trick method.                              ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?  To know what's your GC Version code (2 digit number) go into Config     ?
 ?  Menu, then Version Info, 2nd page. First digit corresponds to GC        ?
 ?  mobo version, 2nd digit corresponds to drive version.                   ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?  IF YOU MAKE BACKUPS, DON'T USE ANY "WIPE" TOOLS TO SAVE SPACE. Unless   ?
 ?  you know it's REALLY working. Most of thoses tools only work because    ?
 ?  the current pso loaders patch libraries routines to emulate DVD. But    ?
 ?  on REAL HARDWARE, each file/fst has to be aligned on a 4-byte boundary! ?
 ?  Else nothing will work. Audio Files (for audio streaming) even need     ?
 ?  to be aligned on a 32kb-boundary ! So forget current "WIPE" tools until ?
 ?  they are fixed. But note that Garbage is NOT NEEDED by the GC. The      ?
 ?  files must be correctly aligned that's it. So if your "WIPE" tool is    ?
 ?  not changing the image size (meaning there's no relocation) then it's   ?
 ?  probably fine. Use FSTFIX by LOONYCUBE to fix bad rips.                 ?
 ?                                                                          ?

 ?  We'll release a command-line MultiBoot Disc maker next week if nobody   ?
 ?  releases a better one before we do :-) Here are the specs for Multiboot ?
 ?  discs. Note that every image should be aligned on a 32kb boundary.      ?
 ?  At offset 0x00: 43 4F 42 52-41 4D 42 31                                 ?

 ?  The MultiBoot feature is stealth for the GC so it's 100% compatible     ?
 ?  with homebrew images. If you want to put several backups on one disc    ?
 ?  you'll have to remove the garbage at first.                             ?
 ?  The maximum size of a MultiBoot disc is 1459978240 bytes.               ?

 ?  Lately there has been a few events we'd like to comment. First,         ?
 ?  congratulation to Utopia for the deobfuscation work you did and the     ?
 ?  release of Anaconda. We like your style :-) Except maybe for the        ?
 ?  "Mentalcube [...] did a well job while choosing the neccessary patches" ?
 ?  we find that "choosing" is not exactly the right term, as this patch    ?
 ?  is the results of tousands of lines of firmware code and several months ?
 ?  of hacking and debugging. And thanks for the obfuscation tips :-)       ?
 ?  Anaconda led to a lot of stuff from the best (GCOS) to the worst        ?
 ?  (people selling our code without authorisation). Anaconda code is       ?
 ?  a 1:1 rip of our code, except for the loading part running on the GC    ?
 ?  CPU that was rewritten by Utopia (they made it clear but some people    ?
 ?  just didn't get it).                                                    ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?  Now about GCOS. We like what you're doing, even if up until now you're  ?
 ?  using our code without authorisation. But we're releasing Cobra 0.4     ?
 ?  drivecodes under GPL license so it matches the license of other files   ?
 ?  you're using. Feel free to use, abuse it and improve it! ;-)            ?
 ?  Cobra 1.0 drivecode might follow in the future, but for now we chose    ?
 ?  closed source.                                                          ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?  It appears that one of our beta-testers leaked a beta of Cobra 1.0 one  ?
 ?  month ago. We'll do all beta testing by ourselves now. We find it's an  ?
 ?  amazing coincidence that a swapless chip was announced two weeks after  ?
 ?  the leak. Please don't support thieves.                                 ?
 ?                                                                          ?
 ?  Oh and about Idle-bug, it was a BUG, yes a BUG of our old cobra         ?
 ?  code in the way we were handling a protection. The bug is now fixed     ?
 ?  and now the laser won't go out of the data area anymore, causing idle   ?
 ?  DREs when it couldn't focus.                                            ?
 ?                                                                          ?

 ?  THE FUTURE                                                              ?

 ?  There's MUCH more to come, you'll see soon :-)                          ?
 ?  And our low-level hackers are currently working on the disc calibration ?
 ?  code to improve Direct Boot Media compatibility. We'll mess with that   ?
 ?  only when we are certain that the code won't hurt your console!         ?
 ?                                                                          ?

 ?  Special thanks to E*Flash for his help, RoM for the early units,        ?
 ?  Melan for the /48 GC and to everybody that tried Cobra V0.4, posted     ?
 ?  constructive feedback. Thanks a lot for your patience. You'll never     ?
