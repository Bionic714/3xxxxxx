,LND,2005-06-17T22:26Z,Nice work Shiimon-kun!
,adam5554,2005-07-12T19:44Z,Has anyone gotten the subs to work?  If you did then how did you burn this?
,adam5554,2005-07-12T19:58Z,Think I figured it out.  I don't think Nero supports subtitiles when burning.  So you should use a different prog. than nero to burn.
,adam5554,2005-07-12T22:42Z,Nevermind.  Subs do work you just have to use WinDVD to view.
,PinkSpider,2006-08-22T23:53Z,"Wow.
Who ever that's seeding ~ thank you so much. (!)

I've been looking forever for the dvd versions of these and not some mpeg or ogg file."
,sweatpants,2006-09-24T22:42Z,"This is the only place where I actually found a SUBBED version of this, nevermind an amazing DVD RIP!! I love Shimon-kun, and all you seeders. 

I just have a request that you guys enable Protocol Encryption in your BT programs, because I'm on a college campus and I can only get around the block with encrypted protocols. If you enable it, I can bring my amazing upload bandwidth to this torrent! THANKS!!!"
,Neferil,2008-04-09T22:08Z,"Have u uploaded the ""betrayal"" part too? Cant find it, and i only got the first part so far. Would appreciate a link to where i can get it, and a subbed not dubbed version at that."
,siloin869,2008-11-21T03:55Z,"I must be dumb, so i apologize in advance.  been trying to copy, and it doesn't matter if i extract direct, or with the right mouse button, because it keeps comin uo w/ the same error msg:  disk issue, or some such thing.  the roxio media program is loading up, like its s'possed to, but it keeps sayong error & ejecting disk.  Do i need a step-by-step?  thanks"
