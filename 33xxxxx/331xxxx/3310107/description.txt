    Newly updated for Visual Studio .NET 2003, the second edition of this    
    book includes fresh information on application and web service           
    development, custom controls, data access, security, deployment, and     
    error handling, new material on web application development for mobile   
    devices, plus an overview of the class libraries.                        
                                                                             
    The material in ASP.NET in a Nutshel is presented in three sections:     
                                                                             
    A fast-paced introduction to ASP.NET that examines topics such as        
    building ASP.NET applications, developing web services, creating         
    custom controls and user controls for maximum code reuse, debugging      
    and handling errors, understanding ASP.NET security, and configuring     
    and deploying an ASP.NET application                                     
                                                                             
    A detailed reference to the properties, methods, and events of the       
    most frequently used ASP.NET classes which include the Page class and    
    the new .NET classes, such as HttpApplicationState and                   
    HttpSessionState, which correspond to the intrinsic objects in classic   
    ASP. Configuration settings in web.config are also documented            
                                                                             
    A Quick Reference to the types (the classes, structures, interfaces,     
    delegates, events, and enumerations) found in web-related namespaces     
    to the .NET Framework Class Library.                                     
                                                                             
    Like other books in the "In a Nutshell" series, ASP.NET in a Nutshell,   
    Second Edition, offers the facts, including critical background          
    information, in a no-nonsense manner that users will refer to again      
    and again. With its wealth of up-to-date information, ASP.NET in a       
    Nutshell is a book that web developers will refer to again and again.
