Hi all!

This is my first torrent so I hope all goes well =)


This torrent is mainly for all Star Wars fans who
never saw TROOPS by Kevin Rubio.

TROOPS was the first ''big'' Star Wars fan film and
it took fan film creation to a new level with cool
3D computer generated effects and well made costumes.

When it was first released back in 1997 it made a big
splash in the Star Wars community with it's black humor
and smart take on events in the original movie,
Star Wars - A New Hope.

This is the new quicktime version of the film which
runs much smoother than the original mov.



Story:

While being filmed for the hit Imperial TV show TROOPS,
Stormtroopers from the infamous Black Sheep Squadron
on patrol run into some very familiar characters.


*******************************************************


Also included as a BONUS;

Kevin Rubio's TROOPS Script
Marily Estes'production journal
The full TROOPS Script
and
The original TROOPS Storyboard of the first
part of the movie =)

This torrent release is in tribute to all Star Wars
fan film makers out there, and a special salute
to the makers of TROOPS 2, or as it's been renamed;
I.M.P.S - The Relentless =D

Story:

An epic documentary of the best damn job in the galaxy.


First part of IMPS is due out May 1st, 2005 (soon ;)
