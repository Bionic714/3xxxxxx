Can you upload the film, anyone? I haven't seen it anywhere."
,Lrak,2005-04-13T21:38Z,There is something wrong with the first song. The file must be corrupt?

Thanks!"
,Bobb999,2007-08-04T20:53Z,"The person who suggested that song 1 ""Pray Them Bars Away"" is FUBAR (f*cked up beyond all repair)is dead right. It's slashed to bits, with the song starting and stopping, with large sections missing, often  replaced by white noise hissing! A true mess.

From what's left, it sounds like it would have been a good song...

I hope someone might replace this injured file with a clean one.

In the meantime, by good fortune, there's a torrent available of  the video of the song, from the movie the album ""Cowboy..."" comes from.
So, there is a way to get to still get to hear it."

Could someone reupload it somewhere else?"
