INFO:
There's a new Daemon Tools-Version out now, V 3.47

It is a hotfix-version to adress the latest issues
(especially the atapi.sys-lock with XP SP2).


The changelog for V3.47:

* Fixed lockup with some images containing bad sectors made by Alcohol (MDS)
* Fixed Nero InCD formatting problem with DAEMON Tools present
* Fixed atapi.sys locking problem (as a result, some emulation ability is removed for PCD5 until new release)

we greatly suggest to upgrade to V3.47 !
