,OdysseusPrime,2007-05-09T03:49Z,Greetings all. Does anyone have an english version of this documentary??
,ken33173,2008-11-08T21:27Z,"WARNING: This is a propaganda film. The prisoners interviewed cannot speak freely. Cubans cannot criticize the Cuban government, otherwise they will be put into prisons, especially the scenario pertaining to this film. The Cuban people don't have freedom of speech. Mr. Stone should be ashamed for making this skewed film. Only the unlearned will buy into this propaganda film."
,ztarken,2009-01-19T01:27Z,Warning: ken33173 is a mindless brainwashed drone. Watch the movie then use your brain to decide if you believe or not. To expand your knowledge by searcing for new angles is not stupifying. 
,ken33173,2010-04-22T22:16Z,"People who attack others by subscribing to derogatory names are most certainly not very intelligent indeed. This type of behavior doesn?t reflect well on ztarken. 

Without a doubt, it is obvious ztarken is not a MENSA member nor has A PhD with an IQ higher than 165 (commodities that I happen to possess). In short, this is a typical behavior from people with a chip in their shoulders.

Tri-la-lu :-)"
