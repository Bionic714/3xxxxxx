I hope someone can reseed this classic."
,artaud2005,2005-04-29T02:44Z,"Gradually, though, external pressure lessens, not out of real acceptance but because everyone wants something from Emmi. Fassbinder falters when inner tensions mount in inverse proportion: the Emmi we have come to know would happily prepare couscous, not spur it as foreign, and would never objectify Ali, showing off his muscles to her colleagues from work. But neither this nor the caricatured rascist grocer and gossiping women ( A homage to F.W. Murnau's great 1924 silent film ""The Last Laugh"") detract from the indomitable and moving connection forged betweenthese two people -and finding happiness with each other against all odds they are wise enough to know how lucky they are."

,raymonth,2006-01-08T02:33Z,That is about the most important one and a half hour I've spent in front of the computer. Truly inspiring. Highly recommended.
