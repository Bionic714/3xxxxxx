,parasizim,2005-04-07T07:57Z,This version is not QXP Passport? Isn't it?
[T],Peterq,2005-04-07T17:04Z,"It's the full version of QuarkXpress Passport 6.1 with the installer for the v6.5 update in the ISO
Peterq"
[T],Peterq,2005-04-07T17:06Z,"Sorry, forgot to mention, it has an autorun for v6.1, update to v6.5 or to open the keygen. It is in the English version."
,kranoath,2005-04-08T05:37Z,Peterq - Do you the the full version and not the Passport one since I already have a lot of the Passport ones. Thanks.
,StopPorn,2005-05-18T04:49Z,A lot of (strange) questions here and no thanks... I at least want to thank you Peterq! :) It looks good and I have a feeling that you are a guy who know what you are doing...
