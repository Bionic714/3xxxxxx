I know, the other torrent stop working and that was because that the private server was closed down. :(
Anyway, this time it should work really well because Evangelium uses new server software, thank to Aaerox!

Test it one last time before you decide to dump it.

server homepage http://evangelium.ath.cx, that states if the server is up or down

also a support thred is avaible at ragezone (but you have to regiser a user):
