Codename Ghost is a brand new action thriller from AMMO Productions. The story is set to a remote place in the Russian city of Murmansk. Mercenaries led by the former KGB-colonel Vladokov, have placed a nuclear bomb, and are threatening to blow it up if their demands are not met.

 

AMMO Productions is a Norwegian production company based in Oslo, which produces a myriad of things in the world of media. We are a bunch of creative students in a non-profitable production company. We make movies, pictures, web-pages, music, programs, scripts, storyboards, texts... you name it! And we do it because it is fun; no business, yet.

We have been around for a couple of years now, and our productional activities are escalating each year. We have made several movies, such as Max Cow and Codename Ghost. More movies are on the way.
