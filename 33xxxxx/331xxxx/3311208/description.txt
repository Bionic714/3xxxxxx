Even people who don't know heavy metal know Metallica. Always 
        controversial, always outspoken, always uncompromising; Metallica
        rose from obscurity to take over the world of heavy metal and 
        become the 7th biggest selling act in American history. Now VH1
        has produced the ultimate no holds barred oral history of 
        Metallica: When Metallica Ruled The World. This one hour long
        documentary will take you through the band's tumultuous 24 year
        history and give you the real story behind their recent ups and
        downs, including James Hetfield's battle with alcohol, Jason 
        Newsted's resignation, and the bands subsequent journey into therapy.
        
        The show begins in 1981 when drummer Lars Ulrich and guitarist/vocalist
        James Hetfield meet each other through "Musician Wanted" ads in a local
        Los Angeles paper and start a volatile relationship that will drive the
        band to the top of the heavy metal world and ultimately to the brink of
        destruction some twenty years later. In between; Metallica's hard
        partying earns them the infamous nickname "Alcoholica", they face the
        tragic death of bassist Cliff Burton, become a worldwide phenomenon
        with the 1991 release of the Black Album and enrage music fans across
        America by taking on music-swapping giant Napster. 
         
        When Metallica Ruled The World tells the tale of the world's most 
        dangerous band through the people who lived it. It brings you inside
        the nearly three decades of dramatic success, drunken debauchery and
        tragic setbacks that have made Metallica one of Rock and Roll's greatest
        stories.
