,gist74,2007-02-14T02:05Z,"Metallica, metal band? Their greatest hit is Nothing Else Matters. Is that metal? No! Biggest sellouts in history. And Lars ""danish accent"" Ulrich is a moron."
,f_2_o,2007-08-17T11:59Z,Let's not forget Master Of Puppets and Justice album. But I totally agree they r the biggest sellouts in rock scene .
,heisiandiishe,2009-03-28T21:06Z,"sellout...

i think its human to have enough of playing music kill em all style 24/7 so they decided to create something different. i didnt like it and still dont like songs on the late albums, but if you go back to what they started with its just stupid to claim that they are no metal band...wtf 

thx "
,gerby1990,2009-08-30T02:24Z,"if u guys hate metallica that much, why bother downloading a documentary of them?
and how can ""heisiandiishe"" even think of arguing that metallica played ""kill em all 24/7"", they never EVER did that, all subsequent albums were completely different. 
u and all the other farts here never even heard a minute of anything other than nothing else matters or the unforgiven.
get the f*ck outta here, people that ignorant and dumb are not even entitled to an opinion so get lost"
,h2o4go,2011-02-16T08:36Z,"""Sellout"" when concerning 'tallica is such a cleche' it's ridiculous! You people are monkey see-monkey do. Gerby1990 is absoloutely right,except I think heisiandiishe,on the kill'emall remark meant their GENERAL metal style of the early period,as opposed to some other albums.Anytime a band is successful they are dubbed as sellouts.And if they are such,NOT the biggest,I don't see a 'tallica family reality show! Anyway I'm gonna seed for awhile to help out if this dl finishes,at least 2gb worth."
