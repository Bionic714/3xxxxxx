,krutan,2005-04-04T00:22Z,"Det här spelet va nog ett bland dom sämsta spelen jag kört, det märks att det är en portning från konsolversionen. Kanske konsolversionen är roligare och färre buggar"
,Sajjemon,2005-04-04T00:47Z,"är de nån som seedar då?
VERKAR DÖTT"

,Cludd,2005-04-04T15:53Z,"""This release is dedicated to pope John Paul II who passed away 02.04.2004""

lol"
,Ingo,2005-04-04T18:00Z,RELOADED did make a mistake there..:D
,cansas,2005-04-04T23:47Z,"does this game work fine with you? i have a much better pc than the requirements are, but its running slow as hell"
,poipoipoi,2005-04-05T09:17Z,the control scheme / perspective is pretty annoying. its to bad it isnt a true first-person sneaker.
,poipoipoi,2005-04-05T09:18Z,and the cutscenes run really badly (like one frame per second!) but the actual gameplay so far doesnt seem toooooo slow...)
,poipoipoi,2005-04-05T12:59Z,"sorry for the triple post... does the savegame feature NOT work for anyone else (I dl'd the 2.47gb pctorrents.com version, foolishly... shoulda waited for reloaded's version.)"
,Ingo,2005-04-06T12:43Z,There are already a lots of seeders..wait...and it should be fine.
,richy_030,2005-04-08T18:04Z,the pope is dead yahoooooo. he is whit his boss now maby asking for a raise 
,LheRoX,2005-04-10T22:45Z,"Please shut up and show some respect.
Alot of the catolics are extremtly sad about the death of the pope so dont shout ""yaaahoo"".

(these tards makes me crazy)

Rest in peace pope."
,Sambrosa,2005-04-16T17:44Z,The pop maby did many good things but he also did many bad things. He was against homosexyel wedings and female rigths and he was against condoms and therfor dident want to stop aids and thats not rigth so screw him.
,bugmenot1,2005-04-22T01:18Z,hey sambrosa ... if you would spell better there might have been a chance that at least one person would take for granted what you say here ...
,Morkul,2005-04-30T00:53Z,"This is a BETA version of the game!
"
,Bitsy,2005-05-02T21:37Z,"Yea, it has to be a BETA release, because they haven't released the official game yet, and there are no info about the release date or any patches on the official web site.. Crap! It looks like a great game, but it's kind of hard playing when you only see half of all the graphics.."
,Morkul,2005-05-02T23:17Z,The game have been released and Myth have released a proper version.
,Morkul,2005-05-07T16:44Z,"Yet another beta release of Stolen.

Is there any non beta release?"
,Xarko,2005-05-10T17:31Z,"the pope dying doesn't matter, sadly he's replaced by an even older and more senile bastard in the matter of minutes.  never ever trust a 90 year old man who have never scored !(something above 15 years old and female at least)"
,haffamomo,2005-05-16T17:32Z,"the patch is out !!!
