,yeager,2005-04-09T15:33Z,Whats wrong with the Surreal64 emulator?
,Hednoize,2005-04-09T16:07Z,"""This is apparently the only Emu for N64 with sound
that´s why i chose it.""

It's not an emulator for n64, and its not the only n64emulator for xbox. :P"
,StonerMan,2005-04-09T17:57Z,"It´s an Emu for playing Nintendo 64 games. Dumbass.
It´s pretty obvious that its not for use with the N64 console, right?
And it´s even more obvious that it´s for use with the XBOX console, right?
since it in the ""XBOX"" category

And did i ever say that this is the ONLY emu to play N64 on Xbox? No way.
What i said was that this was the only emu that has SOUND support.
Surreal64 is three n64 emus in one,(These emulators are 1964, Project64 and UltraHLE) and the way i understand it it´s only if you use PJ64 in Surreal that you get sound, and i wouldn´t care shit about a fucking game without sound.
If that is not the case...well i don´t give a fuck anyway."
,Ork0,2005-04-09T18:55Z,sounds works in all three emulators in surreal
,Squiddy,2005-04-09T23:24Z,"Thanks Stonerman. Ignore these assholes, we appreciate your time and effort. Good work."
,freecity,2005-04-10T01:15Z,"ayyo props man!, i just got 2 questions.
1.will this fir onto a dvd 5-?
2.does the 007 goldeneye rom work on the xbox!?!?!?!"
,weijung,2005-04-10T03:41Z,"Can the roms been copied out of this disc for use in PC?, xcuse my ignorance :p i don't know how games worxz in xbox, but i will like this roms for pc too :)"
,Frezzno,2005-04-10T11:40Z,I haven't dl this yet but I think you can use Craxtion4 to extract which ever rom you like from the iso to use on PC.
,Frezzno,2005-04-10T11:45Z,If you have burnt the iso already then you can use any ftp client to copy any rom from the Xbox DVD-drive.
,krallan90,2005-04-10T21:55Z,är wrestling med eller...för de äger pung!
,ragnmilda,2005-04-11T15:39Z,"i almost can´t get any rom to work, do i need to place it on a xbox harddrive? would that solve my problem?

anyway great work!!  "
,bliitz,2005-04-11T19:08Z,how are you supposed to do with the .iso? mount it with d-tools or just transfer it to the xbox with qwix like a normal game? caused i tried to mount it and it didn't work
,freecity,2005-04-11T21:59Z,"ya, none of the good games work. is there a way to fix this problem?"
,bliitz,2005-04-12T10:19Z,"there is no need to answer my previous question since i fixed it. but i also have problems to play the games, every game i have tried have had serious graphical bugs that makes them unplayable. many of the games have also crashed. and yes, i've used the (recommended) graphic drivers. somebody knows what to do?"
,Frezzno,2005-04-12T14:01Z,"I got a solution: Transfer the iso to HD and use Surreal64XXX beta2.

It's a guarantee that 97% of all the roms will work."
,crossmax,2005-04-12T15:03Z,Does anyone know if surreal v2 is coming out soon???
,freecity,2005-04-12T21:18Z,"where can i download Surreal64XXX beta2, and how do i put it onto my xbox?"
,freecity,2005-04-12T21:49Z,"k i downloaded it, but how do i put it onto the xbox???"
,Frezzno,2005-04-12T22:45Z,"FTP via crosslink to your xbox or burn it to a CD-RW and copy it to your xbox with a filemanager.

FTP/copy the Surreal folder to the Emulators folder."
,StonerMan,2005-04-12T22:50Z,"Okey..i sure made a misstake choosing this emulator
for the torrent.
But, to ""clear my name"" i can post a new torrent with
SurrealXxX 02_01_2005 which as far as i know is the newest one.Works great for me, Maybe not the best one? Let me know.
I can even throw in a ""how to"" of how to extract the iso
you get here and replace the emu in it with surrealXXX, for you newbies.
Let me know dudes"
,Banditen,2005-04-15T15:48Z,"yeah pls do so give me a quick and easy ""how to play emus on xbox"" that would be great /  Banditen"
,warhorse,2005-04-18T01:56Z,"Yes, please do!
Why was this a mistake?"
,Goose_swe,2005-04-21T15:22Z,Ja gör det det skulle vara väldigt snällt av dig.
,karnowski,2005-04-27T19:01Z,"Nice upload, cheers.

Thing is, for all torrents from here (tracker.prg.to/announce) I only get yellow faces in Azureus. I don't think it's my settings cause torrents from other trackers are fine. It's really hittin both my download and upload speeds, anybody any ideas what could be wrong?"
,Peatza,2005-04-30T14:34Z,"Before i Start Downloading this torrent, could someone tell me which games it is?"
,vizzerdix1,2005-05-09T08:25Z,"I dpwnload this torrent but how do i do next????

Is it an emulator?   Is itan iso? "
,uftuff,2005-06-06T04:47Z,"Try some tutorials at 
xbox-scene.com

umm. . . . I'm use the standard version
of Surreal 64 right now.  Haven't 
tried Surreal XXX yet.  Get the emulators
from xbins on irc.   There's a tutorial somewhere,
but in short, connect to EFNet
and for channel you need #xbins.
Oh yeah, this is all in mIRC.
When you get to #xbins you have
to type something like
/msg xbins !list 
then you get a password to login.
Start FlashFXP to
 . . . . . connect to the site.  I think
it's something like 
distribution.emulation.org ????


good luck"
,uftuff,2005-06-06T04:50Z,"sorry, it's 
distribution.xbins.org"
,Gibbler,2005-06-08T15:09Z,When i Mount the iso using Daemon Tools (Newest) Or Alcohol 120% (Newest) the disc gets corrupted. When i burn it using Alcohol 120% the disc shows up empty. I use Azureus for torrents so the file is downloaded correct. Any special file system on this one?
,chasing_amy,2005-06-17T11:24Z,does anyone know if goldeneye is on this rom?
,chronjohnson,2005-07-04T18:44Z,"Yeah good luck with that #xbins bullshit.  The first time I logged onto the ftp it told me that maybe if I followed the rules I wouldn't be banned for life now.  It then promptly disconnected me.  So if you like draconian rules and unjustified bans, hit that up."
,DKShadow,2005-07-16T14:26Z,"Gibbler, ""I use Azureus for torrents so the file is downloaded correct."" Azureus doesnt make everything work tho haha.

Can I get a confirmation that this is working fine on the XboX ?"
,davet669,2005-07-23T00:40Z,Please Seed!!!
,davet669,2005-07-28T23:43Z,Finished downloading but it says the file is unknown or is corrupted?!? any special way im supposed to open this?
,Ichi Killer,2006-01-08T21:19Z,"I would appreciate som help changing emulator for a new iso with this roms! dunno how to do this.
thanks..

btw if someone want to know which games are included, just download the info files.."
,vesper8,2006-02-28T01:52Z,"you can't mount this type of ISO with d-tools or whatever.. nor can you open it with winrar.. this is a special xbox iso type

to extract the roms from it you need to download a tool called C-XBox Tool 2.0.6

you can get it from here hxxp://www.cxboxtool.xbox-hq.com/downloads.php"
,kipzoon,2006-03-28T21:41Z,"Everything went fine, but when i am trying to play everything goes verry slow.... its asking for the expansion pack ????? n e one know what to do?"
,zoltan_jeff,2006-04-06T17:44Z,"Tjena!
Jag har laddat ner denna torrenten och vartenda spel jag har testat är helt värdelöst! Det är grafikfel på alla spel + att ljudet glappar hela tiden på alla spel!
Gör jag något fel?

Jag skulle bli väldigt tacksam om någon hjälpte mig! 

Tack på förhand!"
[V],VilleR2,2006-04-12T09:13Z,"Hey, try this torrent! http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3469851"
,Sterkenburg,2006-06-28T07:39Z,"Why don't you n00bs read the comments and realize that THIS IS FOR THE XBOX, and that NONE OF YOU NOOBS HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU'RE DOING...?

First you think you're smart and download it, then you beg for information that's ALREADY GIVEN.  Gawd this annoys me.


And if you don't have an Xbox or can't read comments (or don't have any common sense - all too common nowadays) DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS."
,Sterkenburg,2006-06-28T07:41Z,"Oh yeah...  I was gonna post to beg for people to seed :)...   so here goes.


Please, for the children!  SEED THE LAST 0.2%!!!"
,_Shuriken_,2006-07-28T17:48Z,"For crist sake yes, seed the last part for the children like Sterkeburg...."
,gator75,2006-09-10T16:12Z,please seed
,sublimemaco,2006-10-26T18:44Z,"I am very dissapointed, not singel game is working, why waste everybodys time posting this crap?????"
,Terrorshark,2007-03-04T14:08Z,Seed :)
,rexinz,2007-03-04T14:23Z,can somebody seed??
,rexinz,2007-03-06T17:16Z,"plz seed. i download 0,5kb/s not so fun"
,StonerMan,2007-05-14T00:19Z,"Sweet to see there are still seeders on this (I added it like 2 years ago!)

People saying ""this is crap"", Well yeah you´re right, today. But 2 years ago that wasn´t the case.
These are almost all the games released for the N64 in the USA, they don´t get any better (I don´t think).

So, If you have ANY know-how AT ALL, then you can d/l this and repack it with one of the new super sweet Surreal emu´s, But still, a lot of games run choppy, and some not at all.
Otherwise you can fucking get the funk out.
