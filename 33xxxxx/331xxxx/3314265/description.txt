<font size="1"><b>This is what i have done:</b>
I took the <u>PJ64-X</u> emu,
then i downloaded <u>Nintendo.64.USA.COMPLETE.-Team.Consolex</u>
Then I made them to an ISO together, I had to delete some crappy games cause
ConsoleX released ALL the USA games in their release,
so it was a little too big
I haven´t tried to run all the games, but the ones i have tried
Have worked pretty good.
This is apparently the only Emu for N64 with sound
that´s why i chose it. Sound does lag at times though.</font>
