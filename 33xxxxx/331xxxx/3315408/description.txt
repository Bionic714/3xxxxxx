I know CS2 is about to be released, but there might be some out there who'd like the DVD version of CS1! No matter how many times I downloaded the CD versions I found that I always had to manually install the progs from CD2 - whether I'd burned from BIN/CUE or from ISO, or even mounted with Daemon Tools - When asked for CD2 nothing happened! so I re-authored the CD's into a DVD using Adobe's original autorun etc - works fine! Serial and PS activation are in the image - enjoy!!!
