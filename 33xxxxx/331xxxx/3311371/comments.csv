,lepetitprince,2008-12-01T18:40Z,"I have spent ages searching for uncensored(dvd rips), without them being complete iso's of the discs(thereby insane sizes) and yet having decent quality. 
These rips by sickboy88 of the first two seasons fits that description awesomely!

ARH! such a shame to see no seeders on all these presumably amazing family guy torrents!

Don't suppose you can reseed them sickboy88?
Or anyone else who has downloaded them?"
