Now about seeding..."
,ramonherber,2005-04-24T13:26Z,"strange it says build 75 when I've done it.  Though I guess that could do with the fact that I've got 2 installs, 1 from patched demo & 1 from full version (both working though)

totally agree with the half-assed tourney mode.  I hate to say it but DD Tournament Poker is the one I still play mostly for that reason.  I hope somebody cracks that 2.0 pretty soon after it's release."
,angelofdeth,2005-07-03T21:53Z,it works fine if you follow the instructions carefully
,crossroads,2005-07-09T11:23Z,"Need a little help.

Installed just the way the instruction stated.

When I start Poker Academy I'm getting a message of ""Could not load main class"".

Unintall Poker Academy and reinstall without the crake but up to Poker Academy update.

Run Poker Academy and the Pro splash screen showed up and of course the activation key request came up. I was just checking if the demo install and update installed properly.

Then install the crack and the same error message showed up, main class can bot be loaded, when I run Poker Academy after the crack was installed.

Any help would be appreciated."

And it is a bark to get rid as well...

Enjoy NOT!"
,sunnysmoke,2006-02-03T13:28Z,could somebody still happen to have da interest to seed tis.......

,goohok,2006-03-10T14:37Z,"Hi ramonherber
It wouldn't work the first two times, but this time it works fine. Thanks for a great program."
,Gamalnok,2006-03-18T13:14Z,Is this working?
,SuaSponte,2006-05-25T01:05Z,This program contains the Troj/Multidr-DW trojan!
,janne-the-man,2006-12-29T13:59Z,why did u extract the files? then it takes longer time to download...
,groomlake,2007-10-25T15:12Z,"ramonherber you fagget - its a TROJAN , dumb as"
,ramonherber,2008-04-22T03:53Z,"Well anything's possible I guess. Only thing I know is that if you try to load it without the exe4jlib.jar it says ""Unable to load main class"", so that would be a very impressive bit of reverse engineering to add a virus to the natural loadup of the program in assembly language.

By the way, the latest version 2.5 is available on the internet now. I wouldn't bother with this version any more."
