Let me start off by saying... It's working! ;).  Verified by me.

I got my hopes up when I saw Poker Academy Pro on the pirate bay, but it didn't work because it wants you to validate your key online first.  I did a search on eMule for it and found this.  

Poki's is generally said to be the BEST texas hold'em poker program made bar none, and is one of the two programs that the professionals practice with (the other being Wilson's Turbo Hold'em - DD tournament poker doesn't quite cut it - too many ai flaws).  I know this because I've been waiting a long time for this to be released, and have read a load of reviews on the different programs.

You could actually download both the Poker Academy Pro Demo and the 1.5.1 (full version) Update at http://www.poker-academy.com, and even patch the demo with the full version update without much trouble, but getting them to work is the hard part.  The info doesn't seem to say who cracked this, but they did a decent job at it (thx whoever you are).

Just briefly here are the features:
-Limit Hold’em
-No-Limit Hold’em
-Tournament Hold’em
-Pop-up Advice
-Advisor
-Player Statistics
-Automatic Upgrades (Heh, you'd better turn this shit off at the options screen or you will find yourself having to reinstall  ;)
-Create/Edit opponents
-Enhanced AI (Vexbot & sparbot)
-Advanced Player Statistics
-Hand Evaluator

check it out for yourself at: http://www.poker-academy.com/products/holdem_pro/features.htm

Enjoy!

PS Read the readme file before running install.bat, but ignore number 1) "Extract all the files" etc, because I already did that part before I uploaded.

PPS If the pirate bay tracker still isn't working by the time you read this (dns problem), try adding this backup tracker, it's pirate bay by ip, and it works: http://83.140.65.2/announce. 

PPPS I've played around and found a way to download UPDATES and have them work.  Since the updates don't change the executable at this point in time, it doesn't need recracking.  First off backup your whole PokiPoker directory just in case.  Update, and them move the file meerkat.xzf that you backed up back into your main directory in the /data/ folder.  Should work, and should contain all updates up to build 75 now ;)

Fyi I have the full version (also available at pirate bay) installed, as well as the patched demo version, because the crack also works with the full version install.  The new meerkat.xzf causes freezes in both the full version and the patched demo installs of PokiPoker Academy, so replacing it with the working file gets the program up and running again.

Would be interested to see if anybody else has the same experience.
