        FL  Studio  is  a  full-featured  sequencer  perfectly suited for 
        creation  of  complex songs and realistic drum loops, with 32 bit 
        internal  mixing and advanced MIDI support. The resulting song or 
        loop  can  be  exported to a WAV/MP3 file and all MIDI events can 
        be exported to a standard MIDI file. 
                  
        FL  Studio  is  a pattern based sequencer, which means you create 
        your  songs in pieces (patterns) using the Step Sequencer and the 
        Piano  Roll  view  and  then weld those pieces together using the 
        Playlist  window  (the Playlist also supports full-featured audio 
        tracks  with  hardrrive streaming). Then you can add a wide range 
        of  effects  to  your  instruments (reverb, phaser, flanger etc.) 
        and  route  the  resulting  mixer  tracks  in any way you like to 
        create complex mixing chains with ease.
