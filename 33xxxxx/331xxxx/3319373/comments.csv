Here I've been seeding 110GB in 4 days using 1/3 of my bandwidth 24/7..."
,ajp_anton,2005-04-28T19:04Z,"270GB uploads, ratio 17.8, and only 7 seeders?"
,Atreyus,2005-04-28T22:40Z,"I'll second that thank you. I've been looking for this one for awhile, now."
,Crossfire,2005-05-05T13:40Z,7 fucking gb with bad uploaders!
,ajp_anton,2005-05-11T11:26Z,"Sorry, har inga subs på svenska. Bara på engelska.

I have some crappy english subs for S1, and ""transcript-subs"" for S2.
I'm making transcript-subs for S1 too, but it takes about an hour per episode. Plus 40mins to watch the episode to see if it's OK.
I've done 8 so far, so I have 13 left."
,aveerara,2005-05-29T08:00Z,Is this a DVD Rip or a TV rip? Thanks.

,ajp_anton,2005-08-02T01:57Z,"For me it works with VLC, DivX player, and WMP (with the right codecs).
If VLC can't play it, there's something wrong with the file.

,butterfliesinmyhair,2006-01-12T23:06Z,"I have good pics, but no sound... Why?"
,loadeddice,2006-01-13T01:32Z,If you're trying to watch it using Quicktime you need to download the AC3 codec for Quicktime. The VLC player plays it with the sound. I burnt it to DVD using Toast and the sound works.

[T],moster_A,2009-04-22T17:14Z,"Tack!!! Seedar nu för fullt, dock kass uppladdningshastighet... (Verkar nu som att folk är rätt ojusta. 33 mot 204). Taskmörtar! 

Bara för att det tar tid att ladda ner 15 gig betyder det inte att man inte har ansvar att dela med sig! Så, skärpning!!! "
[T],moster_A,2009-04-28T16:43Z,"Still seeding, because no one else does. Too bad, why??? Don't you know that sharing is caring? 

Right now 33 seeders versus 186 lechers. What is wrong with you folk? You have to upload at least as much as you download.  It?s an obligation!

(ajp_anton: Stort tack för en bra torrent! Skitbra kvalitet!, synd bara att det bara tog så lång tid att få ner den pga alla nötter som inte seedar efter sig...)"
,johanssonTHN,2009-07-16T11:13Z,tackar för den här

If any of you that have watched all this come looking for Season 3, just be advised the show was axed at the end of season 2.

Gutted when I found out :("

,try2wryte,2011-08-18T02:40Z,"How does one seed after removing the torrent?  I always leave them uploading for a while, days sometimes...but can you allow them to seed again after clearing them out of bittorrent? like days later or whatever?"
,FavouriteX,2011-09-14T22:30Z,"If you do not rename the files and folders you download, you should be able to seed again. Later you get the torrent file as you would like to download. Then place the files and folders you have (the original files having the original names, and also same folder structure) where they are supposed to be when the download is finished. Run a check, and start seeding."
,w00tbie,2011-10-12T11:46Z,i love this show. thanks uploader!!
,FavouriteX,2011-10-29T04:26Z,Me too!!
,nayr1991,2011-10-29T06:32Z,"This is on my seedbox for a month or so, seeding at 1MB/s at the mo"
,ezdvdjr,2011-12-03T17:27Z,"76 comments and i all see is people bitching about seeders. How about commenting on the quality of the rips. I see a few saying- ok or good as its gunna get. I have all the dvds. It would be faster for me to download this torrent if it is of dvd quality, if they are not acceptable rips then i will make my own and upload them here. so can any one who has downloaded this already please make definitive comments on A/V. Thank you.

Audio, 1-10?
Video, 1-10?"
,alwaysodd,2012-02-19T07:35Z,"Must be pretty good if it has the top seeds, but I'll report back"
,Jazzy86,2012-03-19T05:23Z,Love this show from what I have watched that I have downloaded quality is 10/10 but can only reach 99.2% any chance of someone coming on to seed who has complete file please?
