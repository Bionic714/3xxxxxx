Thanx anyway. "
,bt72hw,2005-04-11T05:13Z,"Thanks Toba - I'm honored to have won your compliment as you have helped stoke the fire of my Asian Cinema obsession!

DieBratwurst, I feel your pain on the Gojoe trailer tip for I too once searched for the same. Hope you like the movie, it's one of my favorites."
,bt72hw,2005-04-11T05:16Z,"
I have just realized that the search for a trailer mentioned above might be in regards to the DVD Extras so...

The DVD Extras torrent was pulled for myriad reasons but will be replaced with an AVI rip of all bonus features to make download time more tolerable ASAP!"

,teletubbed,2006-03-09T09:59Z,please seed (stuck at 99.4) 
,teletubbed,2006-03-09T11:03Z,"is this a fake file? 

i found out that unlike other incomplete iso-files it is not possible to open/mount this one. 

by trying to open/mount this (incomplete) iso-file my machine was very near crash. 

it would be great if someone could have a look into the contents. "
,teletubbed,2006-04-24T13:27Z,"I risked to burn this file as it is now (ONLY 99.4 % COMPLETE). 

It played, but it had 2 small jumps and 3 ""artefacted"" sequences (after chapter 20). 

The 5.1 sound of this movie is the best I ever heard since Star Wars. Amazing! Incredible! Invite your neighbours! 

Does anyone have the score? It is great too, but EUR41 at Amazon are a little, little bit too expensive ... "

,Doc.torr,2009-08-02T01:29Z,"Stuck at 96.05% for a week or so now. Please seed!
What I have (an iso of ~4.18 Gb) seems OK, and plays. 

Wonderful movie! Saw it at the Melbourne international film festival years back. 

I'm hoping to convert to DivX .avi for convenience once I get 100% then upload lots (and that's a promise!)
