incase I throw up.
If I wanted to go to a porno site, I would have done so already."
,zeinabqureshi,2008-03-14T19:28Z,"First, I must apologize for not having thanked *phenoumenos* for this wonderful share.

Don't worry too much about the quality...the costumes, the music (which was perhaps copied by Jodorowsky in his El Topo - in any case it's Buddhist chanting I think), is stunning. I've never seen better costumes, or more wonderful music, in any film. In my opinion this is Pasolini's masterpiece, and a stunning interpretation of MedĂŚa. 
BTW, the quality is not as bad as that. The photography is superb - it's like the sun-drenched coasts of Argos. It's just like being there and a part of all the bloodshed and the intrigue. It's a perfect movie."
,zeinabqureshi,2008-05-11T21:02Z,"Well, this used to be the onlr Medea torrent out there for such a long time...but now there is another at tpb and an infinitely better one at another famous site...so, you have options. Whatever the version, make sure you watch this movie, I can never stop talking about it. And I thankfully remember that this was the first version which introduced me to the great work.  "
