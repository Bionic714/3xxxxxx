[T],yiuloan,2005-04-14T21:33Z,don't see you mentioning anything about this being Hoodlum'S release.
,Gucci83,2005-04-14T22:07Z,One should always at least mention the group :P
,pGrim,2005-04-14T23:11Z,Bad crack. Game doesn't work :(
,Beermon5ter,2005-04-15T11:12Z,"Help.  I have installed crack from the Hoodlum dir to the game directory.. The game starts, but when i get to the splash screen it bombs out.  Anybody know of different crack etc??  I sooo, sooo want to play this game.  All help will be greatly appreciated."
,Laserdude,2005-04-15T11:56Z,The game crashes while starting up...what is the prob??
,cfish78,2005-04-15T14:46Z,id mention the developers before the group. since one is a highly trained programmer and one is a buncha punks from ukraine.
,kashmmm,2005-04-15T15:38Z,"Firsty upon mounting the second CD image i get an error, then after installing it it crashing when the loading screen displays. "
,Dobermann123,2005-04-15T16:43Z," kashmmm : I can help you with your first problem, the cue file needs a name change, open the cue file and change FILE ""*********.bin"" BINARY
  TRACK 01 MODE1/2352
    INDEX 01 00:00:00. to FILE ""World Snooker Championship 2005 [English][CD2][www.pctorrent.com].bin"" BINARY
  TRACK 01 MODE1/2352
    INDEX 01 00:00:00  .The second problem ....well it's either a bad crack or a bad release. "
,jaruzelski,2005-04-16T00:28Z,Does anyone know where to get a working crack? 
,R34p3r,2005-04-16T02:17Z,It's both an bad crack and an bad release...
,trixinc,2005-04-16T09:10Z,"Do NOT download this torrent.
I know it's all for free and all that.......But this doesn't work at all.  Bad crack, bad release and bad luck!
CD 2 is knackered in some way. "
,DaWizeGuy,2005-04-16T10:39Z,Crack doesn't work. Crash to desktop with an error message. People really should do some testing before relasing stuff. Hopefully a better crack will surface soon.
,Pat_McNamara,2005-04-16T10:46Z,"Listen to the comments above and DO NOT download these files! It seems like some people are bringing corrupt versions of games online. Like they do with mp3s in kazaa, morpheus etc.
I'd like a decent MYTH-release of the game if that is at all possible. Besides that I can only repeat myself: This download is not worth your time and bandwidth. Don't let them fool you."
,Beermon5ter,2005-04-16T13:03Z,"I have found an image file that works for this torrent.  Use the original wsc2005.exe and mount the image with Daemon tools etc.  I am seeding it now.  It works 100%.

http://www.piratebay.org/download.php/3317581/mini-image.torrent"
,Wifebeater,2005-04-17T00:56Z,Does anybody know if there are any major differences between this one and the 2004 release? Wouldn't want to download this just to notice that it is just the same as last years.
[T],pctorrent,2005-04-18T11:33Z,You only must wait for a good crack...
,droors,2005-04-20T13:26Z,"SERIOUSLY! Please seed the Mini.Image torrent file!

I want to see if the problem I'm having is  cuz bad crack"
,Pat_McNamara,2005-04-21T14:07Z,"Sorry folks, some days ago I told you not to download this file, but turns out, it didn't work because of the bad crack. Otherwise the release is fine. Just downloaded a mini image, mounted it with daemon tools and now it works smoothly. So feel free to download and enjoy this beautiful game."
,dirion,2005-04-24T09:46Z,"so, i downloaded the mini-image! how do you get it to WORK? i desperatly NEEEEEED this game to work! please tell me how the mini-image works??? :D"
,Vedkaris,2005-04-24T10:00Z,"I downloaded the mini-image too and mounted it with Daemon tools, but still can't get it to work. Need help!!"
,Pat_McNamara,2005-04-26T11:06Z,Another thing comes to my mind: Did you replace the original wsc2005.exe with the cracked one? You mustn't do that. Stay with the original.
,Vedkaris,2005-04-26T16:54Z,"Tried the mini-image you recomended bit it still doesn't work. Did not use the Hoodlum crack, stayed with the original exe"
,bish,2005-04-27T17:27Z,"My game loads up fine and plays fine but my problem is that when i exit a match or practice to return to the main menu screen, 100% of the time my game hangs and my pc locks-up with a blue screen needing a reboot.

I havent used the hoodlum crack, have a clean install of the game with the mds mounted in daemon tools.

As i said game works fine until i exit my current game to return to the main menu then the blue screen appears with system hang."
,bish,2005-04-29T16:02Z,anyone offer any help for this problem?
,hermpie,2005-05-04T12:47Z,"Can somebody who has the game working tell me what todo ?

install the game , don't apply a crack....

but what's this mini image about ?  do i just have to mount it before i start to play or what?

thnx"
,WBeattie,2005-05-05T16:46Z,Edit the cue file to what?
,WBeattie,2005-05-05T16:47Z,"I'm getting the error: 

Unable to mount image, Cue sheet line 1, file not accessible.

Anyone had that?"
,bish,2005-05-05T20:07Z,"i still have the same problem, game runs fine but everytime i exit a game to the main menu it crashes making my pc reboot, so im unable to complete a match."
,Autistpikken,2005-05-07T02:04Z,Anyone got a manual for this one? 
,WBeattie,2005-05-07T22:46Z,"Come on people, I'm not as smart (computer wise) as a lot of you so my problem should be a relatively simple one. When installing, I'm being asked to insert the second disc, I try to mount the 2nd cue file and get an error message."
,gurra_and,2005-06-07T19:36Z,try to extract both cd:s with isobuster andput in a map install   Then mount the mini image (do not use no cd crack i did not and it works perfect)

,LillMorris,2006-02-22T04:59Z,"Do NOT download this. It doesn't work. I'm not the only one with this problem, when the game starts up, and the loading begins; it crashes! I've tried with 4 different cracks, and none of 'em is working! This really is a bad release, and it's at least 10 offer persons who have the same problem as me. This i totally crap!"
,source600,2006-04-19T21:23Z,wow thanks Djemit that powerIso program really worked :D

,Partybwal,2006-04-25T14:29Z,"Game works. Just make sure you DON'T use the crack. If you use the crack first, and then the mini-image, it won't work, the mini-image works only with the game after install, without cracking it. The mini-image is available here at piratebay."
,willhaigh,2006-04-25T17:19Z,"This game works fine.............DONT use the cracked file. Mount an image file found on many websites, jus google it. Then just play using the original exe, I am using daemon tools and it works fine.."
,kgb28120,2006-04-25T19:43Z,"wy CD2 setupfile is setup.2? is that wrong? CD1 has setup.exe. so wy cd2 setup is setup2.exe, what i do?"
,willhaigh,2006-04-27T23:07Z,"Setup.2 is right you should use this on CD2. Just mount bothe cds then find setup.2 in CD2 when it tells you,"

The only thing you have to do really is to download the crack when you've installed the game..."

,boozemonster616,2008-11-01T00:06Z,"to get rid of the black lines on the screen, try changing the Hz settings of either your game or your monitor... or perhaps both, ive been playing this game since it first came out and i remember having to do something like that when i first installed it.
after 4 years of playing though ive still only won one event, if you play one poor safty against a top player they more oftern than not score a century break."
,lexxius,2008-11-17T11:10Z,not work? Read comments! But after you run this game you will see old & twisted graphics. Game SHIT!!
,gAr-88,2009-01-21T00:27Z,"this game works fine if you follow the instructions from ""rikscajao"". a bit slow but it might just be my computer. no problem on vista home premium!"
,robhead78,2011-03-04T15:32Z,"iv never had problems installing games before but this is ridiculus,iv installed cd 1 and 2 which took forever,and have the mini image which doesnt seem to mount it says ""please insert cd""
