,bonega,2005-04-05T10:25Z,"Heh... having a crappy day?

Good quality rip btw, cartoon mode works wonder for this source.
The only(slight) complaint I have is with some wierd vibrating of certain frames. "
,bonega,2005-04-05T11:31Z,"Thnx - will try that out.
Btw: Do you hang around Doom9?"
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-06T03:20Z,"I've written under a lot of aliasas there, yeah. No forum, only ariticles."
,bonega,2005-04-06T11:08Z,"Cool.
Everyone in the ""knowhow"" comes from doom9 :)"
,bonega,2005-04-09T11:57Z,"Hi.

Do you have any plan for releasing the third season?
Eagerly awaiting your nice rips :)"
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-10T10:10Z,"Yeah, it's cooking right now.  See my comment on Elektra though."
,d3ciph3r,2005-04-12T00:34Z,"To sickboy, or anyone who has a completed avi file, are these  compatible with standalone divx dvd-players?

i.e. No Qpel no packed bitstream no 3 warp point GMC.

In fact if you could open it up with mpeg modifier http://www.moitah.net/ and copy and paste the video info output that would be useful.
"
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-12T01:58Z,"Yes, everything I make is compatible with stand alone ESS chipsets and other players (phillips dvp-642, etc)

I use a custom matrix...I thought it was common knowledge that I watch my movies on a hardware device myself, and that they are all ESS compatable.

All of the torrent information you need is in the torrent description.

The only thing missing is that it's a 23.97 FPS."
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-12T06:36Z,"Yeah.

What you're going to want to do, to do it like you want, is:

1. Using DVDDecrypter, rip an ISO, with remove IFO RC and RCE protection checked (2 boxes)

2. In the general settings, make sure you have ""remove macrovision"" checked.

3.  Rip the dvd to ISO, then turn right around and burn it to a dvd+rw.  This copy will not have any region or macrovision protection.

4.  Purchase a Plextor PX-M402U or PX-TV402U Convertx

5.  Place your dvd you just burned into any dvd player, and run the RGA cables from it into the Plextor ConvertX.

6.  Press play on dvd player, press capture on plextor.

It will encode with HARDWARE REALTIME.  You don't need to fuck with virtualdub, or anything else, which is pretty tricky sometimes for someone just starting out.

The plextor is great, because you can move all of your vhs, betamax, etc REALTIME into divx as well, even if you have a k6-2 300mhz, it will still work provided that you have usb 2.0"

There is the very infrequent B frame bit rate spike."
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-14T03:12Z,"Make sure you grab the newest firmware for that player.  The  new one adds better subtitle support, and improved playback of custom xvid matricies.  Should take care of your spike."
