,notreallythere,2007-03-11T14:45Z,"Is this the 120 minutes they did when nothing first started?  If so, it's great, I remember when this was on.  Videos from PWEI and Prick plus interviews and (sadly brief) performances by NIN, Marilyn Manson, Clint Mansell and Prick.  If it's not that...what is this?"
,Zurr0,2007-04-06T22:32Z,"It's mostly performance footage of the Fragility tour and of course trent commenting and talking about the dvd, it's worth getting for sure. Does not show the interviewer, but like I said mostly footage of the tour."
