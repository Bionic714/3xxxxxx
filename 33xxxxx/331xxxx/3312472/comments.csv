,StopPorn,2005-06-22T00:09Z,"This is SO nice!!! I am so happy to have found this! I was actually looking for YMO when this came up, and what a nice surprise. I haven't been thinking about them for MANY years but now I even have this itch in my brain because I had a 12'' with them but I can't remember which one... :( And even worse: I have sold it! :( *2 Now I just wish the YMO-torrent will come alive too... Lazy downloaders as so often here at TPB! Anyway: thank you so so much, clone! "
,StopPorn,2005-06-22T00:17Z,"D-mn!!! Now I remeber which 12'' I had, since I hear the song in my ears in this moment: Unit! It would have been something for your collection, clone, wouldn't it? :) A really FAT 12''... I remeber that I even played it when I was DJ-ing, at least once. But the I have a memory of the small-town people leaving the floor in a hurry... :)"

,Iwera,2007-08-28T16:07Z,"Hej

Av Logic System har jag 3 LP?s; Logic (1981), Venus (1981) och Orient Express (1982). Är de fortfarande av intresse? Superskön musik!"
,MaxHeadroom,2007-09-03T19:33Z,"Jaa, Iwera, mer Logic, har en gammal repfri vinylare själv, även 16 bit om nån kommer ihåg. Tyvärr vet jag inte hur man konverterar en LP till mer moderna saker. =("
,Geinstein,2009-02-22T07:23Z,"I love their ""Logic"" album. I still have the original vinyl LP. Would love to have a decent FLAC version of it, though."
