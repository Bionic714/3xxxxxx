Really good. Works perfectly.
Also try the add-on:
                                 Sin : Wages of Sin
                   (no torrent available try the slow eMule ;)
You also should sign the online petition for a Sin 2 game !

,Joaqii,2008-07-10T12:08Z,"Nobody should hate old games (unless you're bat-shit retarded). Fact of the matter is, a recent tendency is, when graphics go up, gameplay goes down. Though some of the bad guys in this game looks like pieces of brick glued together and you yourself have about as much personality as a dead badger, it's got an engaging story and some very cool scenes and sceneries. Def gonna down this one. Can't wait to finish it, and see that goofy face on John's face, when SinClaire spreads her legs in the end movie! (hope I didn't just ruined everything for those of you who haven't played it.)"
,Juninhoslo,2008-09-24T22:13Z,"Seed plz.

Do you have(wages of sin)?

Thx and have a nice day"
