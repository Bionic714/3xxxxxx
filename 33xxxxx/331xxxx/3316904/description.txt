8 of 8 in a History Channel boxed set (Special Forces & Snipers)

I hope you enjoyed the series. Keep a look out for the entire "BUD/S Class 234", 12 part series "Inside Special Forces" and "Navy SEALs - Americas Secret Warriors"* after the weekend.


* quite crappy documentary, but it contains some rare footage and a cool Stoner Mk63 documentary.
