If you are going to watch this, you'll want to install the NEW XviD codec:

http://www.koepi.org/XviD-1.1.0-Beta1-16012005.exe

For top quality, make sure you use the XviD decoder configerator, and turn on
(Y) and (UV) deblocking, and the new feature of XviD 1.1.0 (Y) and (UV) DERINGING.

If you have a slow computer, turn it off. I don't want another stupid motherfucker telling me that my movies are out of sync because they are totally computer illiterate.
