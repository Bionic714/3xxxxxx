,Fastolfe,2005-04-11T23:02Z,Is it really possible to burn this ISO image on a DVD? 
,XorpidXult,2005-04-11T23:13Z,Would love to see it as a 700mb xvid ;)

,megalux,2005-04-12T00:31Z,is it only in russia or  on english to?
,quantumduck,2005-04-12T01:44Z,"This is a russian movie with english subtitles, as stated. I have kept it uncompressed for those that want the best quality. If you want to compress it to fit whatever size you want, there are many tools available, such as DVD Shrink (for a DVD-R sized movie). I'm sure someone can compress it to a 700MB CD once they have a copy. Enjoy the movie!"

,Assassin,2005-04-27T19:27Z,700 or 1400 mb Xvid would indeed be a winner.

,eterna111,2005-05-11T01:36Z,"I downloaded it, made only the main movie into a DVD5 with Nero Recode (although you can use other programs like DVD Shrink), and it's playing fine. With English subs.

And yes, it's Nochnoy Dozor. :)"
,scy69,2005-05-18T09:13Z,"The trailer says that its going to be a trilogy, if I remember right. Am I wrong? "
