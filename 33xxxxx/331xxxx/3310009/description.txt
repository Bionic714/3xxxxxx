Boris Blenns legendary solo project Electric
Universe returns to the forefront of the
psychedelic trance scene following a year of
sonic exploration and production on his seventh
album 'Cosmic Experience'. A pulsing and
energizing sound experience from beginning to
end, Electric Universes newest work radiates a
vibrant force through an aura of musical
maturity. A musician known and loved for creating
unforgettable moments of electronic trance dance
history, the persistence and perfection of Boris
Blenn's distinct style across his long running
producer career, re-emerges on 'Cosmic
Experience', uniting his iconic brain-twisting
synth leads and resonating basses with his
exceptional audio engineering craftsmanship. On
its own a big enough reason to include 'Cosmic
Experience' in your psychedelic exploration kit.
