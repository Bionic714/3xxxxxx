,Joper1,2007-02-12T21:16Z,"I cant get this to run.

Installs fine, but i just get sound and a blank screen. Anyone know a way to solve this?"
,swodah77,2007-08-19T10:28Z,"Had the same problem as Joper1, it's video codec related thing. Solved it by renaming the start movie clip Op.avi file in the install folder (you can watch it before doing that...) so that it cannot be found..."
,MisplacedFate1313,2008-05-07T00:31Z,"As of Mid-April 2008 I have been continuously seeding this file, and am happy to do so. While this game may not appeal to everyone, I would like to ensure it's existence for those who enjoy it.

For my part, I had no problems installing and mounting with Daemon Tools Lite. I hope more people will seed these bish?jo games, which are enjoyable across cultures, yet are difficult to get in this country.

Thank you, EasyTarget, for your service to the community."
