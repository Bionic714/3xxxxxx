This week, we decided to split it into 3 different torrents. It started with one of our forum members asked for a rather small concert, which only included 2 videos. Then i decided to make a couple of those instead of just one! I know most of you probably prefer some longer shows, with more songs, but there's got to be something for everyone

This is the first out of three from the 14th week of 2005, and decided to give you the performance from the tribute show to the fallen hero's from 9/11... May they all rest in peace!

But, but, but... Nothing good comes out of thinking about this tragedy, so lets just focus on the future! We have a new album from the bizkit coming out soon, and i guess we are all excited about this - i know i am!
