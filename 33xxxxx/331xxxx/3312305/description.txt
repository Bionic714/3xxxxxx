the product. The product will automatically create the following sub-keys and 
values in the HKLMSoftwareKasperskyLabavp6TraceDefault sub-key:
		TraceFileEnable      = 0      // cFALSE
		TraceConsoleEnable   = 0      // cFALSE
		TraceDebugEnable     = 0      // cFALSE
		TraceUseDbgInfo      = 0      // cFALSE
		TraceFileMaxLevel    = 500    // prtNOTIFY
		TraceConsoleMaxLevel = 300    // prtERROR
		TraceDebugMaxLevel   = 400    // prtIMPORTANT
		TraceFileMinLevel    = 0      // prtMIN_TRACE_LEVEL
		TraceConsoleMinLevel = 0      // prtMIN_TRACE_LEVEL
		TraceDebugMinLevel   = 0      // prtMIN_TRACE_LEVEL

	Change the TraceFileEnable's value to 1. Restart the product once again. 
The product will create the 
AVP.exe_6.0.9.95_hour.minute.second_processid_hosttype.log file.
