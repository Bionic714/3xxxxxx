       I'm sorry to admit that I could not keep the menu due
       to unsuccessful attempts of ifoupdate. The process of
       updating the ifo seemed OK, but while testing I could
       not get past chapter 32 (of 33 totals). Anyhow, let's
       say that the menu was nothing to be sorry for, since
       it's pretty ugly and it is an 15 loop, very poor
       indeed. The extras aren't worth mentioning, since
       there was only a cinematic trailer.

       As for Monophonic Audio, it is the original audio track
       of the movie so there's nothing wrong about it. A qoute:

       Because the producers wanted to preserve the original sound of
       the movie, Terminator 1 was released in Dolby Digital 1.0.
       There were also no subtitles present on this disc.
