It`s the refreshing season of early summer. Deep in the lonely mountains in the great scale of nature, there is a secret base. It was where a male reform school "Hane no Oto" Campus is located. Going there is the "Baka Trio (Idiotic Trio)" - motivated spirit "Bachigoo", typical idiot "Ichibansei" and big giant, "Tenjin" goes to. And last but not least, the average main character Takasaki Yuusuke. 

Worrying about his campus life, disaster decides to pay him a visit! So that everyone can attend classes together, an evaluation period takes place allowing high school girls to come along. The Baka Trio are first ones to get excited on the campus. However... faced with the unknown opposite sex from the city, they don`t know how they should approach them. And so... eventually the bus the girls travelled on arrives. 

"Yuusuke-kun!" 
The girl Chitoshe Midori appeared before Yuusuke and greeted him! Eyes meeting, the girl hugs Yuusuke... who is this girl???
