"Meili" means "beautiful" and "shiguang" means "times." "The best of times" marks the anxiety existing in many young hearts. This film records some of the Taiwanese' living mode as well as their struggling pain. Those who don't succeed are meant to be doomed. The boys who go astray, according to this rule, finally go to an end. We are appalled by the fate they finally come to meet, but we inevitably smile when they end in such a dreamy way. This film depicts a Taiwan Hakka (hope I'm not wrong) family whose beloved young ones thrive and wither. The life in the film is very close to some of the contemporary Taiwaneses' and yet contain a magic realistic touch. The boys, barely educated, see interesting things as they live on thro' the dull days, and they are eventually allowed to escape from the world full of venom by plunging into the safe water, where we viewers' hearts rest with theirs.
