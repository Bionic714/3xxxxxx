Does anybody have the ""Simulation"" Disk ?"
,XxGLITCHxX,2008-04-09T00:54Z,"ive got the sim, if GMT wants to reupload this into a pack? i give him permission to use mine. im seeding alot of traffic rite now and its hurting my upload speed.

GMT if u wanna make a copy of Arcade+sim, just download mine and re-upload a dual.

thanks XxGLITCHxX"
,XxGLITCHxX,2008-04-09T22:36Z,".NRG file? doesnt work with ePSXe?!?,

dont worry for thoes that use this for ePSXe, make sure to mount this Image Using DAEMON Tools. Its free to download. google it. Mount the NRG file(with daemon tools). and then in ePSXe. run CD-DVD. (not ISO image-option!)"
