    The heart of C# in a Nutshell is a succinct but detailed reference to    
    the C# language and the .NET types most essential to C# programmers.     
    Each chapter in the API reference begins with an overview of a .NET      
    namespace and a diagram of its types, including a quick-reference        
    entry for each type, with name, assembly, category, description,         
    member availability, class hierarchy, and other relevant information,    
    such as whether the type is part o the ECMA CLI specification. Newly     
    updated for .NET Framework version 1.1, the second edition also adds a   
    CD that allows you to integrate the book's API Quick Reference           
    directly into the help files of Visual Studio .NET 2002 & 2003, giving   
    you direct access to this valuable information via your computer.
