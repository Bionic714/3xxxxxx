"
,Shiimon-kun,2005-04-30T00:18Z,You need to burn it to a dvd or use a player such as PowerDVD or WinDVD.
,ben_urich,2005-06-14T00:08Z,"when i play it in powerdvd i get no subs. i can choose between eng and jap sound, but not subs. help plz :)"
,adam5554,2005-07-12T19:42Z,Burnt the iso to a dvd-r but when I play it with Japanese audio I get no subs.  Help??
,adam5554,2005-07-12T19:58Z,Think I figured it out.  I don't think Nero supports subtitiles when burning.  So you should use a different prog. than nero to burn.
,adam5554,2005-07-12T22:42Z,Nevermind.  Subs do work you just have to use WinDVD to view.
,PinkSpider,2006-08-22T23:52Z,"Wow.
Who ever that's seeding ~ thank you so much. I've been looking forever for the dvd versions of these and not some mpeg or ogg file."
,sweatpants,2006-09-24T22:42Z,"This is the only place where I actually found a SUBBED version of this, nevermind an amazing DVD RIP!! I love Shimon-kun, and all you seeders. 

I just have a request that you guys enable Protocol Encryption in your BT programs, because I'm on a college campus and I can only get around the block with encrypted protocols. If you enable it, I can bring my amazing upload bandwidth to this torrent! THANKS!!!"
,Funbuns,2007-04-10T18:14Z,anyone know if you can play them all in english audio?
,frunns,2007-08-19T00:55Z,"Probably a good release, but why would you rar it? Would've seeded both otherwise... =/"
,saragra,2007-08-29T02:24Z,IT IS PAL FORMAT

,Fetching,2008-05-02T17:28Z,"Hey guys having a problem...

unziped the file using winrar

,armthehomeless,2008-05-28T21:23Z,"If anyone is having trouble playing this after burning to dvd due to PAL. there are a couple tecniques you can use to convert pal to NTSC. I simply use IFOedit. It's Freeware and simple to use. (steps to burn iso.) mount image file with daemon tools, open the drive you mounted it to and drag the video_ts folder to your desktop or where ever you want... next open IFOedit and at the bottom left corner click ""open"", browse to the TS folder you just extraced from the mounted drive. Now you should have a dropdown of allot of info. next at the very top you will see a sub tab just highlight the top line and then go down to the lower part. ""vmg overview"" and depending on what way you are trying to convert, Pal to NTSC, or viseversa double click on any line that says ""PAL"" or ""NTSC"". Now you will see a new window pop up. ""Video attributes"" should only need to change 3 things here. Under standard. Click NTSC, or Pal if you are trying to make the file pal compattable~ next, click 720X480 resolution. Lastly, under static, click Automatic Letterboxed. now click save. After clicking save a little box will pop up asking if you want to save the file as .BUP, aswell, click yes, and that is it...rinse and repeat on every line that says PAL. then open the rest of the TS files and do the same exact thing. there will almost always be more then 1 TS file to convert, might want to double check each 1 after you you are done to make sure they all say NTSC now and that you didn't miss any. that's it. just burn as usual now. this works for me and on allot of dvd players, and my PS3, hope this helps some of you having trouble with PAL conpatibility issues.. goolgle PAL to NTSC for more info. on other tecniques if this doesn't work for you. (recommend using a DVDRW for your first attempt to see if playback works for your dvd player) i didn't make this teqnique and not affiliated with them in anyway just a satisfied user. don't blame me if you mess somethin up."
