Compiled via a fan survey conducted on her website, Björk's Greatest Hits eschews presenting the tracks in chronological order, making for a jumbled ride through the vocalist's unique, twisted and frequently brilliant discography. Some choices will grate on the nerves of purists, and it would have been nice to hear something from Selmasongs, but with Björk's incredibly consistent discography to work from, it's impossible to screw up a retrospective compilation such as this.<br />
