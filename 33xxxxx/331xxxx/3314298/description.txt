"U.S. missile and air strikes on Iraq are almost routine. Staples of media coverage include Pentagon-generated footage of jets roaring off carrier decks, bemedalled generals with their pointers and maps showing targets, government officials and pundits making pronouncements about Iraq, weapons of mass destruction, the evil dictator who violates international law and the continuing need for sanctions. Is there something missing in the official story? In this brilliant presentation, Chomsky peels away the layers of deceit behind U.S. Iraq policy. He exposes the hypocritical U.S. positions on weapons of mass destruction, concern for the Kurds, international law & the U.N."
