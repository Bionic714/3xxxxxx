,Stc-racer,2005-04-06T09:40Z,Totally cool REL.... =) Thank You So Much!!!!! =)
,kallamari,2005-04-06T10:46Z,Is there a DTS release yet? Removing DTS really sucks. :(
,mephist0,2005-04-07T23:28Z,Can anyone confirm this? If this is true the movie should be deleted!
,mephist0,2005-04-09T06:38Z,Can anyone confirm that 5 minutes is missing in the movie???
,Van_Gogh,2005-04-09T22:50Z,"worked fine for me, no missing 5 min on my sample."
,Halcy0n,2005-04-13T01:32Z,"Great release, there were no problems during playback. The poster above obviously made a bad burn."
,Halcy0n,2005-04-13T01:33Z,"By the way, what's so bad about removing the DTS? Many stereo systems don't support it (like mine) and I really doubt you could tell the difference between DTS and 5.1..."
,Huge-Raven,2005-04-17T20:21Z,"VERY NICE QUALITY!!! :D
The only poor thing was the lack of Swedish Sub
But other than that, very nice dud!!!"
,Ree01,2005-04-18T09:25Z,"Hade DTS funnits kvar hade det varit en klockren release, men denna 채r nog s책 bra.

BTW: Blade kan verkligen inte s채ga ""Mother Fucker"", man skrattar bara. ;) "
,mictian,2005-04-28T13:27Z,"You ignorant bastard!!! you don't hear the difference between Dolby Digital and DTS... the transfer rate is almost twice as fast as the Dolby rate... which results in a wider sound spectre and definently more sound!!!  Experince ""The brotherhood of the Wolf"" DTS soundtrack and you'll get it.. :)"
