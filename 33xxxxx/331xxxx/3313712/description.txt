<b>Game Info:</b>
Your adrenaline pumps and your heart pounds as you wait for the
starting gate to drop. Every turn, every jump and every second
increases the potential for disaster. But nothing is going to stand
between you and the checkered flag. Not today.
Jamie Little, the voice of motocross, helps bring the MX World Tour
experience to life. Offering more than 30 levels of both indoor and
outdoor action, Jamie herself even gets into the action. So strap up
as we tackle hairpin turns, jarring rhythm sections and more to take
home the championship trophy.
