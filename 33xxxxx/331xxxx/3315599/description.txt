some info I found on the web:

Since 1979 founder Mark Pauline and his partners Matt Heckert & Eric Werner have been creating machines of legendary destructiveness and horror. Their performances, mostly around the Bay Area, have caused a degree of mayhem, created widespread excitement and have always involved the local constabulary. This video documents five mechanized performances by SRL between 1985 and 1986.
