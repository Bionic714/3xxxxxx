The Spanshit Inquisition extension for Mozilla Firefox

The Spanshit Inquisition extension for Mozilla Firefox was written to address the large amount of spanish spam-torrents on The Pirate Bay. After a quick installation, torrents with titles matching a set of keywords can be filtered by double-clicking in the torrent-table frame area.

In this first (and maybe only) version, the filter is triggered on the following words:

'[spanish]', 'pctorrent', 'limitedivx', 'limitevcd', 'espa', 'firedivx', '[french]'

which are the ones I personally would rather not see usually.

The matching is case insensitive. Next version may have functionality for adding/removing words, but until then it's possible to unzip the .xpi, changing the words and rebuild. DONT ask me how to do this. roachfiend.com has a how-to on Firefox extensions - follow that.

Anyone who would like to do further work - please do! Then tell me about your much-better-version so I don't have to update mine ;) A script that triggers on page load would be nice for example.

To The Pirate Bay admins: Wake the f*** up and get that dubbed section going!
