Fina hångelminnen till Eye In The Sky :)

Tackar!"
,yourdaddy,2005-04-09T17:55Z,Very nice Mr.Cheese. I'm a big fan of Parsons but I'd rather download these albums in FLAC even if mp3/320 is OK. Have a nice day.
,Mr.Cheese,2005-04-10T10:28Z,"Don't think you my dad. Born 1951 so....

Anyhow, when I started to ripp these albums some years ago the alternative was Monkey's Audio but there was no larger interest from other + media was dearly, 3-4 EUR for a 650 MB."
,Scabben,2005-04-17T01:09Z,Thanx a lot. Been looking for Eve and Tales.. Here they are.
