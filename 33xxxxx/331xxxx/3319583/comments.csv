,artandsoul,2005-04-21T17:55Z,"yepp, dessutom seedar de som lägger upp torrents klart där..."
,lassekille,2005-04-22T16:36Z,"Takker :-)

Legg gjerne ut mer av Michael Palin."
,lightnin,2005-05-25T22:04Z,"Don't worry, thats life in the pirate bay. But thanks man. :)
I'll seed these torrents a little bit now and then, I think. You never know..."
,myrddin_embries,2006-07-02T14:18Z,"I'd like the three that aren't here.

Full Circle.
Pole to Pole
Around the world...

Pretty please with sugar on top?

I will start seeding after the summer holidays. And I have quite a few tidbits"
,Palio,2006-10-07T14:13Z,"It would be really interesting if you find the above movies. Ive discovered the trip movies of Palin lately and I thinkg there are really worth seeing. Not probably because they are so interesting but because of the scenery and pictures.

Btw thanks for still seeding."
[V],flyboy1,2007-02-06T15:07Z,Kan du legge den ut som DVD og med alle SUB's? (hvis det er en DVD du har da?).
,geoffphuket,2007-08-31T09:17Z,"Full circle, pole to pole and around the world in 80 days, can be found on VEOH or Stage6 "

,s.m.r.t.,2007-10-17T12:16Z,"Great!!  Vite nekdo, kde bych mohl sehnat ceske (slovenske ) titulky nebo cesky (slovensky) dabing?"
,TaoBaba1008,2008-08-20T17:30Z,"We don't understand ""knutte jotte hutte totte"" why don't you guys speak English !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,hypatia62,2008-11-29T02:07Z,"To Taobaba:Don't be so disrespectfull about someone elses language. Hollander zeker? Alleen wij zijn zo maf om Engels te praten met elkaar.
(Transl. ""You must be a Dutchman. We are the only people crazy enough to speak English to each other."")
Be grateful to our Scandinavian friends for these exceptional torrents. 
To Lightnin:Tack, thanks, dank je wel!"
,peskov,2012-03-31T17:47Z,"i've been seeding this for about 16GB, will continue until 20GB because it's just that good, although I think the longer shows (80 days around the world, pole to pole, full circle, himalaya) are a must watch too!"
