"This is a brilliant, exceptional piece of travel film-making and the sort you would expect from the very likeable and interesting Michael Palin.

He lands in Tangiers and from there sets out to cover the whole of the Sahara region, travelling from west to east - typical Michael Palin material, really. This encompasses a series of train, car and river journeys all excellently shown with some very good cinematography. Lots of wide vistas of deserts - along the lines of Lawrence of Arabia and the English Patient, etc. - and lots of town scenes and interviews with musicians, traders, and others.

There's a lot of ethnic music in the programme too (particularly episode 2) which reminds me of Buena Vista Social Club, only this time it's Africa.

The 2 disc DVD is good though with very few additional features. It would've been nice to have some stuff on how they film the series - for instance, Michael Palin is often shown departing on a train yet where do the film crew go? Do they follow in a car or what?"


Eventuellt kan jag även lägga upp de andra Palin serierna senare:
Pole To Pole with Michael Palin.
Himalaya with Michael Palin.
Full Circle with Michael Palin.
Around the World in 80 days with Michael Palin.
