,brucemc,2005-04-14T14:16Z,Just use 123-45678912 or any series for serial run Keygen to activate. Enjoy.
,rhodos,2005-04-14T14:27Z,What kind of program is this??
,brucemc,2005-04-14T14:41Z,If You do not Know You do not need it. It Is a very sophisticated drawing program. It has a high learning curve. Some architectural students take years to learn all the facits of this program.
,HugeOh,2005-04-14T19:47Z,Is there any use in waiting for you to seed?
,brucemc,2005-04-16T07:27Z,"Unpack the rars with winrar or Pkzip. Burn the iso. Alchohol works well. Run the installation input serial # 000-00000000 any series. Run the installation. Reboot system to renew registry. Explore disc for keygen located in crack directory. Block internet traffic. Run program. Enter code generated by Autocad into Keygen.
Choose Permant and Commercial. Click on enter activation code. Enter codegenerated by Keygen. Activate program. Sorry this coomment took this long but my modem took a dump after I completed the seed.
I hope this helps. Enjoy."

BruceMC Your one of those Geek Wankers that promote yourself as one of those elite types and that no one but the higher learning can comprehend anything to do with Computers. Spare us, your just someone with no life sitting on your fat ass.

rhodos every program out there is worth learning don't let this smuck diswad you. It's a drafting Program and any moron can work it.  The only reason it took those in college years to master it, was because they had a low aptitude for learning.  I've had it for one week and it is pretty easy to grasp. For a Carpenter or novice like my wife. Oh but you must pay attention while working with it."
,breakfast4,2006-04-12T01:32Z,Yeah what he said
