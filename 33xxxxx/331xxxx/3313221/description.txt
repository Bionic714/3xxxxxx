Ok, here it is, the 2nd of 2 requests by Ivo...

This is the Japanese flick from 2000...high reviews on IMDB.com...

I haven't seen this movie yet...but, from what I hear, it's fucking great.  During my three system playback test, I was able to sample some of the violence...it's pretty good...someone got their head blown off by a pistol, and I mean the whole fucking head disintegrated into a crimson mist...not a little bullet hole...THE WHOLE FUCKING HEAD EXPLODES...rather realistically might I add.

I can't wait to see this.

Audio is Japanese...no dubbing here...subtitles are English and HARD ENCODED...that means you don't have to fuck around with an external pack...they are overlayed onto the movie.

Fun stuff...

If you are going to watch this, you'll want to install the NEW XviD codec:

http://www.koepi.org/XviD-1.1.0-Beta1-16012005.exe

For top quality, make sure you use the XviD decoder configerator, and turn on
(Y) and (UV) deblocking, and the new feature of XviD 1.1.0 (Y) and (UV) DERINGING.

If you have a slow computer, turn it off. I don't want another stupid motherfucker telling me that my movies are out of sync because they are totally computer illiterate.
