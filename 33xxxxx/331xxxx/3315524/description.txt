Here comes the last disc, Reflection.
As you see everything is just as on the previous DVD's, untouced.
It's 7,86GB so you will either need to split it to two DVD's, or reencode it
with a program such as Clone DVD 2 (the third edtition sucks) or DVD shrink. It's almost complete fool proof, so if you never done that before it's not hard.
There was a lot interviews you maybe can remove :/
Anyway, I left it to you to decide what to do.
