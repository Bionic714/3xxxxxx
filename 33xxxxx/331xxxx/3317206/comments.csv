,ther,2006-04-13T02:54Z,"6th season of buffy is not good at all in the begining. But acording to me and many others with me the best episodes ever in Buffy airs in this season..""once more with feelings""  either you love it or you hate it..
And bye the way ""once more with feelings"" is james martres(spike) favourite episode;) 

you will raise you eyebrowns alot in this season..mostly it is good but there is some really bad things too:(

if have you not seen it... download it now!!! 
And if there are some one who have not seen buffy at all I strongly suggest you downlaod the first season..and if you think the firts season was nooo good..then just wait the second season rules!!! "

,sas89,2008-04-04T10:18Z,Please Seed
,Glitterspell,2008-05-01T00:58Z,"Someone said something about an error here, is there a certain codec that you need to play this file where the footage won't scramble? Thats the only problem I have with this season and it's my all time favorite because of Dark Willow. Either then this season I can play the rest great upload Johosc without you I wouldn't have been able to watch Buffy's complete series and I have enjoyed it thanks a bunch. Can you fix the error for me? I dunno how but it downloads okay it justs, won't play right..."
,Glitterspell,2008-05-12T15:14Z,"Hey thanks Johosc download seems to work perfectly now, last time it scrambled on me and I couldn't see a thing now I can see everything, and to those of you having problems seeing this season as well you need the windows classic media player to see it. Thanks again for this wonderfull download Johosc I love this season..."

,psphackerowned,2010-03-03T03:38Z,is this a TVRip or DVDRip
,digmeup,2010-05-25T20:50Z,"@ther the correct name for Spike is James Marsters. Yes it is his voice, because he has his own band. Actually everyone's voice in ""Once more with Feeling"" are all the real voices. Only thing is, Allison Hannigan only6 sang a few lines because she felt her voice was terrible. The girl who plays Tara sang beautifully! Giles is a veteran when it comes to singing. Everyone else, well, they were ok. "
,Taaanzie,2010-07-01T15:07Z,"Sweeties, please seed, ya? d: "

,Vday,2011-07-23T01:25Z,"Download took less than a day, audio and video are fine, DVDRip FoV subs work perfectly and... It's wide screen!!! Thanks Johosc."
,Joe_Dude,2011-09-27T22:38Z,"I only have the first 5 episodes finished. When I started the first one the audio was out of sync. I skimmed through the others and noticed that they were out of sync as well. Are all the episodes like this? I really don't want to mess with it if so. Thanks anyway Johosc, I downloaded all of your torrents for the other seasons and they worked beautifully If I can't get anything better I'll probably watch these anyway and just try to get through it without losing my mind."
,You_Muppet,2012-04-09T02:51Z,"So funny, the @dude had a similar problem with another series of Buffy :)  There was nothing wrong with that series and there's nothing wrong with this one. Quick and Quality, my two favorite words when downloading a torrent. Ta"
,Bulbouswhore,2012-07-24T21:28Z,Can somebody please seed? I just need this and season 7 then I'll be done. I'll be seeding when/if it ever finishes.
