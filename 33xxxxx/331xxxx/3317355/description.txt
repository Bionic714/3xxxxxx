This album is a beautiful introduction to an amazing singer/songwriter. 
As a single-disc overview of Tim Hardin's career, it would be difficult to improve on this 27-song, 78-minute compilation from Australia, which draws from his entire output — including his Verve, Columbia, and Atlantic catalogs — and encompasses the definitive versions of such songs as "Hang on to a Dream," "The Lady Came From Baltimore," "If I Were a Carpenter," "Reason to Believe," "Don't Make Promises," "Red Balloon," and every other one of his songs that was ever turned into a hit by someone else. The mastering is impeccable, with rich, finely detailed sound throughout, and the packaging is even better, with detailed notes that sort out the anomalies and confusion surrounding Hardin's output about as well as any account that this writer has ever read. Anyone wanting an introduction to Hardin's entire career and his evolution as a songwriter and artist couldn't start from a better place than this.
