I have a small collection of serial numbers, for 23 different Mac OS X applications, which I in the past have looked up on different places to use myself on my downloaded apps. I'm now sharing them all in one package.

01. Microsoft Virtual PC 7 with Win XP Pro
02. VPC7 supplied Windows XP Pro (you will need this if you want to use Win XP on the VPC emulator)
03. Apple QuickTime 6.0 Pro (11 different numbers)
04. Apple Motion
05-08. Macromedia Studio MX: Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash and FreeHand
09-12. Macromedia Studio MX 2004: Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash and FreeHand
13. Microsoft Office 2004
14-15. Apple iWork '05 - Pages and Keynote
16. Apple Final Cut Pro HD 4.5
17. Apple Final Cut Pro HD 4.0
18. FileMaker Pro 7
19-23. Adobe Creative Suite: Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, GoLive, Acrobat Professional

I haven't bothered to arrange them or make a uniform collection out of it and there is no guarantee that they all will work - some of them is quite old. But it's better to share them than not to share them anyway, I think ...
