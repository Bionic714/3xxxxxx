,superdoris,2005-04-11T12:45Z,It says that a song is called 18 Scott Walker - 30 Century Man...In fact that song is David Bowie - Queen Bitch
,drdoom,2005-04-16T17:53Z,its a cover you moron
,Bedappled,2005-04-25T16:26Z,"No im pretty sure thats not Scott Walker singing on that song. If you've heard Scott Walker then you know thats not him.  A Scott Walker song is in the movie though, which I would like to hear, but the last song is not it. "
,311stylee,2008-01-17T06:54Z,Yeah this torrent sucks. It is missing songs. There are 20 songs on the release. This one has only 18. And like others have mentioned it's missing Scott Walker's 30 Century Man. This shit is why I miss Oink. Don't Download.
