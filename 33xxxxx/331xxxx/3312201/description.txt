An excellent band from Quebec who released the one album.
This album is great downer vibed heavy rock of the period with slightly-broken english vocals which just add to the overall feel and rock n roll legitamacy of this band.
Quebec had a large and varied prog scene and its too bad so little of it has been re-ished.
Enjoy!
