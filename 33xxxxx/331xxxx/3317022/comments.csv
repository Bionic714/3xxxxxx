,mrjohhny,2005-04-15T15:46Z,All the titles have English Version ??
,pwrmoves,2005-04-15T19:26Z,"I downloaded Day Of The Tentacle from this torrent, the readme is in English."
,fr4gg3,2005-04-15T22:40Z,"I think that all the games are in English original language...

I tell u again (as earlier on the info page), 
to play the old games like Mi 1, 2 u have to unpack the game and use the Scumm program becuase these games are not compatible with Windows XP.. 
U just find the path where u installed it and click 
open and then just play it! (Scumm program) 

:) 

I hope u have fun.. "
