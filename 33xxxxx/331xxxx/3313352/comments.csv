,hddscanner,2008-05-11T22:38Z,"Works fine for me.

Extract through winzip, mount the bin file with Daemon Tools (make sure you display ""all files"" when looking for bin to mount) and it'll boot up no problem.

Thanks for the upload."

,xX5P1K3Xx,2010-03-28T23:49Z,"Great game, need to be a ISO tho...

But its a easy fix:

Rename the "".bin"" and "".cue"" to ""goldium"".

The "".cue"" is just a soundtrack CD, teh "".bin"" is the game

Mount and Run..."
