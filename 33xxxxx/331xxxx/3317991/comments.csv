,longball98,2009-06-09T23:34Z,"I'm going to be uploading a full working of this short game tutorial if there is any interest still. In addition I've come across 2 other titles called : 
""AJ The Truth About The Driver Parts 1 & 2"".

I'll try and compile them all into one VIDEO TS folder which you can then burn into a nice DVD with your favorite burning software."

Try to open your MPEG video file with MPEG Header Corrector and fix time index table of MPG file. 

You can download MPEG Corrector from here: MPEG-Corrector.zip or from this web page: TechnikTeam 

1) Unpack it
2) Launch MPEG-Corrector.exe
3) Click File -> Open mpeg..., open your broken mpeg.
4) Enter destination file name (save fixed MPEG as...).
5) Click ""Fix it!"" button. 

That's all. "
