Here's the deal on this track:

From the NiN.com official track lists:

"Notably, the vinyl edition is a double LP and includes Home between Sunspots and The Line Begins To Blur. The CD and Dualdisc do not include Home, though it has been released as a promo item at With Teeth listening parties.."

I haven't seen this posted in 320bps here at TPB and I've searched for it.. forgive me if it has.
