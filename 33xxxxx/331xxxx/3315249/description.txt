Contains Disney Satellite, Good Grief, Demo Reel, I'M LATE!!!!!, Swing Shift, the first part of The Wizard Of Speed And Time, and the first part of Mike's Live Show at DragonCon 1997.  These are poor quality conversions from poor quality VHS.  It seems that unless I specifically put Mike Jittlov in the description, the searcher seems to miss it.
