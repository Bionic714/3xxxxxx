,darksidzz,2007-09-07T17:50Z,"This game was good, unfortunately now that it's been awhile I realize just how hard it really is... I mean come on shooting ppl by using the arrow keys?! Give me a break... and of course the incredibly hard puzzles which you always prayed weren't going to screw you over."
,StayPlation,2008-02-05T13:14Z,"Yeah remember this game. It's great for its time, and still great. A little hard though. "
,alexjensentx,2008-04-28T08:20Z,"ok, so I try and install it via dosbox and no matter what directory I choose to install it, it tells me that I dont have enough hard drive space...I know I have 4megs of space! what should I do?"
