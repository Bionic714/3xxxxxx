Alright here is a real treat for everyone, this the Mighty Leatherface back in 1992 on a german cable TV show. This is a very rare pro-shot show and even features a very drunk Matty Blagger. This has been cleaned up etc as best i could and is now a hell of a lot better than the VHS copy Dickie Hammond gave me LOL. This is just fucking brilliant, get it and be blown away.

Leatherface - Bremen Cable TV 1992 SVCD 80m

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to 2xCD's and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 2 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.   http://www.videolan.org/
