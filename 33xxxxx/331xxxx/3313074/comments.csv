,Dyno_Might,2008-01-21T21:36Z,Whats the matter with you people ?? Why do you keep putting duff programmes ? Sad little gits!
,tutting,2008-03-02T16:27Z,Works OK for me. You can get problems if the directory names are too long. Also it can be a bit fussy about which QuickTime you are using. Try v6.5.2 or if you already have v7 installed this worked for me: opening the Quicktime Player > Edit > Quicktime Preferences > Advanced > and under Video Change from DirectX to Safe Mode (GDI).
