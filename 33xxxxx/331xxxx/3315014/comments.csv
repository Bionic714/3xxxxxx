,Kothoga,2005-04-18T14:25Z,Vart hittar man The Sims 2 till PC?
,pluk,2005-07-09T11:26Z,"When i write the immage, the program doesn't accept the cd after the installation as original cd. What's the problem?"
,Rajje,2005-07-26T02:23Z,"Did you burn it correctley? You must use the Copy (image file)-function in Toast or the Burn image-function in Disk Utility (or anything similar).
Just burning the img:s contents to a CD probably wont do it."
,phylet,2006-03-21T04:15Z,someone please seed last few MB.
,Fodes,2006-05-15T17:11Z,"i've got a problem... i burnt the cd correctly, but when i wwant to start it says: error code = 17....

,jirkris,2006-09-12T18:38Z,"Did anyone burn this cd without problems. If so, what did you do. I get error code 17 aswell."
,rawsp,2006-09-28T00:38Z,"i don't think i'd be wrong in saying that there is something wrong with the image file.  I'm getting the same error ""code 17"" as well.  When I tried to verify the image in DiskUtility, it was unable to, coming up with an allocation error"

,mikestrutter,2008-03-27T23:12Z,"Okay, I've got a G3 IBOOK 12"" 500mhz running OS X 10.3.9. I burn the image to a disk then install.  Everything installs fine onto my hard drive and I get Error Code = 17 too!

I seee so many people are still downloading this so someone must have the answer.  Do we need a nocd patch and if so where from?? Please help!"
,jlroettger,2008-04-29T23:37Z,"ERROR CODE 17 FIXED!!!

after installing:

1) mount ""The Sims.img""

2) copy the folder ""The Sims 1"" (its icon looks like a disc) to the desktop or something

3) open the folder ""The Sims 1"" with toast

4) make sure you're using the Mac & PC data type

5) rename ""The Sims 1"" to ""The Sims"" in Toast

6) save that bitch as a CD image

7) mount that CD image

8) play some sims

for whatever reason the CD images wouldn't work if I made them from within the mounted img (hence step 2) or if i made them using the Mac Only data type in toast (hence that part of step 4). maybe someone else can figure it out

enjoy~"
,arturoimaz,2008-05-08T06:08Z,"Guys! I fixed the 17 Error and mount the working sims. Uploaded the fixed one here

,boivinm,2008-06-02T04:41Z,"burn the sims.DMG or the simscarbon.img?  is the img the file after youve installed the DMG and it has a little picture of the sims as the icon? the original sims file has a circle through it. it only allows me to choose the sims carbon..  do i burn the sims carbon img

,breathenacht,2012-08-24T01:53Z,"At those asking: no. NOTHING works on Lion. Well, nothing old anyway, and it's hacking me off royally right now. Apple stopped support for PowerPC applications with Lion, so if that's what you've got... you're screwed. (Oh, and if your machine shipped with Lion, you can't install an older OS instead.) No nostalgia for us. Dangit."
