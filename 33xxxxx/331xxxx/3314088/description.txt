  We were not surprised when the &amp;quot;Will of Steel&amp;quot; fake was released.
  Not that a fake release was released under our name. As we know fakes
  are not new in the scene.What did surprise us was how our modest impact
  on the scene is enough to enable someone to put the effort into creating
  a fake release, in the sad attempt to make us look lame. Some people have
  way to much time on their hands.However what more of a compliment is there, 
  than an opposing bully of a group trying to release fakes under our name?
  Our competition seems to build envious respect.

I have test this verison and it works fine! Install the game and do as nfo says, but start the game with CD 2 mounted. Then it works.
