,STP,2005-04-11T08:58Z,Thanks man :)
,DanielDPT,2005-04-11T10:07Z,Hmm no menu :(
,Viggo2,2005-04-11T10:29Z,"It's ripped from a ""demo disc"", the only option in the menu is to select audio and subs.
This you can do by pressing the audio or subtitle button on the remote several times.

I remove all extra to get the best quality on the film."

,Supermick,2005-04-11T14:13Z,"I adore  people  that removes menues  and  extras,bonusmaterial  from dvdripps ,,,, for  boosting  quality
i'm  hoping  that  moore  starts to do  just  that
 THANX a  million"
,buerrebal,2005-04-11T15:17Z,"Yeah, but it makes NO sense at all to remove anything, if you dont keep the size to a full disc, ie 4.36GB!!!"
,buerrebal,2005-04-11T15:35Z,"BTW, thnx for the up."

,Peracer,2005-04-12T01:22Z,why then remove anything and menus ?that's amazing lol..
,Viggo2,2005-04-13T08:42Z,":-) I don't always think before I remove.. Always do it this way...

I hope some of you keep seeding as soon as you get 100%
I have some more to upload.."
,Misseke,2005-07-24T11:42Z,It would be so nice if someone who has the full 100% could reseed again so we - stuck at 99.1% - could finally enjoy this movie.  THX a million :)
,therealJL,2008-03-19T15:43Z,SEED please !
