,eristoff77,2005-04-09T14:16Z,"Could you please post the complete second (and possibly third)  season after you finish the first season?
Thanks in advance"
,Orusaka,2005-04-09T15:25Z,"It has always been the plan to post the complete 2nd and 3rd season after I finish the first. I had planned to do 8 in the next one, finishing the season, but if more people would rather have one with 5 and one with 3, I'll do that."

and I could help with season 3."
,eristoff77,2005-04-10T14:44Z,"8 is fine by me. Could you please reseed episode 215? There are 8 people stuck @ 99,2%. Thanks in advance! I really appreciate the effort. "
