Fler borde seeda ROMs och emulatorer... själv är jag på jakt att göra min TOSEC samling komplett."
,Norvegia,2005-04-10T18:47Z,"Hi there, I have 2 questions to do:

- How large are the CHD files?

- What are they needed for?

Thanks in advance ;)"
,vonkruel,2005-04-11T02:10Z,"A small number of the games ran off hard disk instead of ROMs - the CHDs are hard disk images of those games.  Those images tend to be large (in the tens or hundreds of MB).  If they were all included I think the size of this torrent would be about 2X what it is, whereas the number of games you can play would only go up by one percent or something.  Personally I wouldn't spend downloading-time/hd-space on a .CHD unless I know that I want to play that particular game.

I hope that helps."
,Norvegia,2005-04-11T02:43Z,"Yep, it helps ;)

One last question: are you gonna be seeding 24/7? So I can estimate how long is this going to take :P

Thanks again vonkruel."
,Norvegia,2005-04-11T11:46Z,"OK, thanks for the replay. By the way, do you also have a cabinet? Just curious :D

Ah, and one more thing (sorry): when a new update appears, does it fix existing games or adds new ones? And, should we expect anything special when these updates reach 1.0?

Really appreciated ;)"
,dm93,2005-04-11T14:10Z,"hey man....i have a question...

is it possible for you to burn these and mail them to me...

I would be more than happy to conpensate you for these, i just don't feel like waiting forever for these.

you can get me over aim at dm9312345

thanks!!!"
,Norvegia,2005-04-12T02:17Z,"Thanks a lot for the info vonkruel!

P.S: Never thought mame roms and CHD files DVDs were on sale on internet and for such a low price :o Quite tempting :P"
,vonkruel,2005-04-12T04:16Z,Sure thing - I am glad to help spread the MAME joy :)
,tokudai1,2005-04-16T09:21Z,Thanks for this! looking forward to building a stand alone unit -  will seed as long as I can
,vonkruel,2005-04-19T06:18Z,"A big THX to the few, the proud.. the seeders :)"
,badhad,2005-05-05T09:39Z,"Fantastic collection. Thanks for the ULing this baby. Its been a long haul but its almost there.

Cabinet is a pipe dream at the moment - and it looks like its going to be a self builder as there is no way I can fund a Slick upright. Does anyone have any experience of the X-Arcade stick? Looks the part and comes in a hell of a lot cheaper than Slick. Lookey here - http://www.x-arcade.com/two-player.shtml

Cheers

,kebabbert,2005-05-08T17:23Z,"I have never tried MAME, but frankly, this sound to good to be true. Im a bit sceptic. ALL arcade games Ive ever tried??? Well, its worth a try at least. You can't have it all..."
,badhad,2005-05-09T00:21Z,"to kebabbert - this is everything you ever dreamed of* and so much more.






* - exept that dream you had about the school nurse touching you in your special place. MAME is good - but its not that good."
,vonkruel,2005-05-09T09:21Z,":) lol badhad :)

Glad you're enjoying it - MAME is surely one of the coolest things on this earth and I really just _had_ to post this.  I got lots of cool stuff from tpb - so it's good to give something back sometimes.

My cabinet is on hold for the same reason -- not enough $$ :(  There's never enough $$ to buy all the cool stuff is there??  So you gotta prioritize.  My current priority: building a dual socket-940 system: dual 2.2 GHz opterons, 2 GB pc3200 ecc ram (1 GB attached to each processor).  Come to daddy!  The best part is that I'll have a cool upgrade in a couple years: put dual-core chips on there, for a total of 4 cpu cores :)  Will be a kick ass machine to run Linux on (and do software development on) for years.

AMD's tech 0wnz Intel's.  ph33r the AMD tech!!

Take it easy,"
,kebabbert,2005-05-09T15:29Z,"There were some requests to buy these files. Here you can by these DVD's and other complete DVD collections (C64, Amiga, etc) too:

http://www.allmyroms.com/shop/index.php


Im downloading these MAME files now, but normally I get like 10Kb/sec. Is there something wrong, is it normal? Have I missed something? I configured my firewall, yes..."
,vonkruel,2005-05-10T05:58Z,"If you've forwarded ports 6881-6889 on your firewall, then you should be OK.  It's possible that your ISP is blocking those ports though (because BT is bad m'kay), so you could try using different ports.  I'm using ports 6891-6899.  Obviously you have to configure this on your BT client as well as your firewall.  Also make sure that you have upstream bandwidth available - since fast UL => fast DL.

Anyway I've dealt with the allmyroms guy twice now and I can recommend him.

Good luck."
,Mitchjack25,2005-06-18T00:29Z,"Vonkruel, you are a lifesaver!  I've been trying for years to grab an entire complete MAME collection!! Thanks so much for this!  I'm at 30 percent, please all don't stop seeding!!  Thanks Guys!!
"
,vonkruel,2005-06-18T11:49Z,It's nice to be appreciated -- even it it's by ppl I'll never meet :-)  Have fun - and seed 1X of course :)
,Quon,2005-06-25T12:45Z,how many of the games are working? in estimated % ?
,vonkruel,2005-06-26T15:05Z,About 90-95% of the games work.  In MAME you can easily see which games work and which don't.
,mtsm,2005-07-04T06:02Z,"hi man...i downloaded this...the entire 14gb...all files have the same size..and most of them are corrupted...tried with unrar and other decompressors
is it fake? or am i doing something wrong?"
,vonkruel,2005-07-07T11:42Z,downloaded 3484+ times and you're the first person to mention a problem...
,mtsm,2005-07-08T02:54Z,"thats weird man...i was crazy for these games.
im gonna try downloa again
thanks"
,vonkruel,2005-07-27T06:51Z,gonna seed this again for awhile
,vonkruel,2005-08-15T06:32Z,"If you have checksum failures when trying to unpack, the first thing you should do is get your BT client (I use Azureus) to ""Force Re-Check"" - that will confirm for you whether or not your copy of the data matches up with the original (correct) data.  In any case - I am 100% confident that this torrent is not corrupted - although your copy of it may indeed be corrupted.  Or you could have a hardware fault -- who knows..."
,BlackCat944T,2007-02-22T20:44Z,"Hello... I just started to download this Torrent...

I am somewhat not surprised that there has been in excess of 4500 downloads and ONLY 1 SEEDER ?

People, once you download, its common curtesy to seed the file at least a few times.

Anyhow... No use ranting, you can never change the nature of the beast... LMAO

I will seed this for a while...

Thanks Vonkruel"
,Wise72,2007-05-28T00:18Z,"Monster Torrent!  This is real good stuff! Personally I Prefer mame32plus as emulator but this works too. Whoole lot a roms... This is the games that should be in every computer.........

Thanks vonkruel!  Helping seed as long as possible...."
,richucard,2007-10-23T02:26Z,"Awesome upload, but please seed!"
,nafro76,2008-03-20T19:59Z,Please seed more!!!!
,805566,2008-06-11T09:57Z,"This is just what I was looking for... except for one detail.

Don't span one archive across 4 DVDs. What if one of your discs goes broken or missing? What say you about that game in between discs? Come on guy...

I will get this set, repack it with mame32plus (popular choice), arrange the titles into four separate DVD-sized 7-Zip archives (WinRAR can still extract that) and seed that. I trust vonkruel's judgment with the config files so I'll leave them be... But have the community in mind.

When people download something of this size, they tend to want it premastered to a science. I can certainly lend the resources to accomplish that.

No hard feelings. Awesome collection."
,tracklancer,2008-08-24T18:21Z,Seed please!
,vonkruel,2008-11-24T09:20Z,"@805566

LOL

I packed this up several years ago, if I had it to do over again, I'd do it the same way.

Idiot."
,Dooly00000,2008-12-29T23:46Z,"using MAME 0.128 Superset Verifier (ROMCenter RC300), I found out this set actually has a lot of working game... I'm working on completing every bit of BIOS and games, using this set as skeleton. I got about 65% complete and 15% incomplete and 20% broken. :3

Thanks for this great release.

P.S. when it comes out, I'm planning make sure this set goes out of date. :)"
,sdx,2009-01-06T21:20Z,"So is there any good ROM set with all roms for the MAME of today, that don't have lots of outdated roms? URL?"
,Dooly00000,2009-01-23T13:06Z,"^ Working on it. Need about 1000 more now, excluding CHDs..."
