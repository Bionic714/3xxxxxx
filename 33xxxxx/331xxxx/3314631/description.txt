Hello,

I have compiled a complete MAME-0.95 (*minus* the CHD images which are very large).  It's about 14 GB, all verified with CLRmamePro, and includes:

   - artwork
   - backgrounds
   - cabinets
   - control panels
   - flyers
   - history
   - marquees
   - roms
   - samples
   - titles

I also include the DAT files that I used to verify everything against, so you can verify for yourself (it's OK - I won't take it personally :)  Come to think of it, you'd have to get the DAT files from another source in order to really verify...

My upload connection is 50 KB/s - I have a little other seeding to do, but in a few days I should be able to dedicate my link to this torrent full-time until there are other seeders around.

I have RAR'd it into 50 million byte archives, because of the very large number of files included, especially in the roms directory.  All rom sets are zipped of course, but the number of zip files is large enough to cause problems with 'too many open file handles' for some clients.

PLEASE HELP SEED - spreading the wholesome MAME goodness will help your karma (or it won't hurt anyway).

The origin of this set: I got a mostly-complete 0.94 set - and updated everything to complete 0.95.  Anyway the games work great - you could grab this, then just keep it for years and years without bothering to update, because the emulation works very well in general.

Also - here's a few plugs:
