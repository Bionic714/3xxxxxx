,redmetoc,2011-02-08T01:04Z,"Finally finished the download.  If it wasn't for a single SEED, I'd still be hanging out......so that'll teach all you LEACHERS to help out when your downloads are done.  I'll seed until at least 1.0 if not more.  Looks like a good flick...let's do what we can to ensure other folks get to enjoy it.

Minor problem with this torrent: when loaded in the latest version of VLC --- NO SOUND!  But when loaded in the latest version of MPCStar (4.9) - crystal clear sound.  The torrent file name has ""AC3"" embedded in it.  From research on AC3 on a different torrent, I thought the AC3 filter requirement could be a problem unless the AC3 files had been downloaded and installed, BUT MPCStar seems to have handled any ""AC3"" issues transparently.  Hooray for MPCStar!"
