This is a request for KEVIN.  Here you go my old time china.

Yeah, this is another Beta 2 encode.  The shit's amazing, especially with all of the pre-processing on.  Good movie, although odd.  Get your fix for jewish punk rock.  Features The Ramones as The Ramones.

NO MORE REQUESTS.  I can't fucking keep up anymore.  Sorry.  Let's just trust that I have good taste, and that you'll get your movie eventually.  I have some movies that I feel need to be seen...

The only way I am doing another request for a while, is *IF* I already have the movie encoded, and have it archived.  So feel free to ask.  If I have it made already, I'll throw it online.  If not: Tough titty said the kitty when the milk went dry.

There is a NEW version of XviD 1.1.0 out. If you have XviD 1.1.0, you most likely have BETA 1. You need to download and install BETA 2. The link is at the bottom of the page.

For top quality, make sure you use the XviD decoder configerator, and turn
on (Y) and (UV) deblocking, and the new feature of
XviD 1.1.0 (Y) and (UV) DERINGING.

If you have a slow computer, please turn off pre-processing. I don't want
another stupid motherfucker telling me that my movies are out of sync
because they are totally computer illiterate.
