,shinobiung,2006-05-31T11:16Z,"it has alot of missing scenes from silent hill1, all the conversations with Lisa seem to be missing, also the conversations with kaufman. And the awesome scene when Lisa turns into a zombie. Its a nice set of cut scenes, but does not contain ""ALL"" the video as you say. Thanks anyway"
