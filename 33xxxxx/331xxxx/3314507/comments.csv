,Zelest_c,2005-05-12T11:37Z,"The reason for the small Size of Final Fantasy III (The game that was released for nes, Not the game you Americans might know as Finalt Fantasy III, that one is really Final Fantasy VI as stated before) is that it is the Nes-game, emulated with a NES-emulator for Playstation."
