,Buppe,2005-04-13T09:39Z,ffs... why did you even upload it then?
,eax,2005-04-15T09:15Z,"Geez, you haven't even let one person download the whole thing so what was the point in uploading this torrent at all?
If it takes too much of your connection you can always limit the traffic for it to like 10kb/s and that way someone will finish (although it will take some time) and help seed."
,SabbiS,2005-04-17T12:50Z,so can anyone tell me if theres a point in downloading it at all?

,XxRevanantxX,2006-10-29T05:33Z,"weeeeaaaak dood i get to 50% and the tracker times out
when you seed something SUPERSEED or at the VERY LEAST seed until 3 people have the full file
and the rest of you leechers, its common curtacy to leave a torrent seeding for 24 hours when your done"
