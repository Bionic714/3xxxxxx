01 - Almost over
02 - Faith

For the first time www.back2bizkit.net brings you a koncert that has Mike Smith in, instead of Wes. Seing in the light, of Mike's departure, and Wes' rejoin, i thought it would be cool to remember the old day with some good ol' Wes shows... But, but, but. As the third part of this week, I decided to give you one of the in my opinion best live shows with Mike, and perhaps one of the best faith-perfomances by Fred! Mike or Wes... Either way, a great show!

go to www.back2bizkit.net and get your say on what should be the next torrent!!
