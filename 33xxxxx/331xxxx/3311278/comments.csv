I hope LucasArts releases more games like this one and Jedi Academy.
The graphics is great, not only for the time of its creation but in present day as well, it rivals games like UT and HL2 imo, especially the ability to slice body parts off of your enemies, its really brilliant :D

,loymo,2007-10-17T09:07Z,"for any noobs 
1.download torrent
2.extract files using winrar

3.using daemon tools (or anything this mounts images i.e. alcohol120%)mount the big winrar file
4.install game (autorun will automaticly appear if uv mount image correctly)
5.once complete do not use the auto run to start single player game instead quit
6.use desktop icon simply double click and have fun "
,{TheMax},2007-10-30T07:25Z,OK here you can download Daemon Tools www.daemon-tools.cc if you are too lazy to download it you can also burn the ISO with Nero and then install it from CD.

,dave359,2008-11-24T17:16Z,"Harry417 - this is a span-zipped archived - the ISO image has been compressed into multiple files which are each 25MB big with the exception of the last file.  If you simply select all of the files & tell them to extract, the entire ISO image will unzip to the folder you're in.  Hope this helps.

Simenfuru if you're getting the message ""GLW_StartOpenGL() - could not load OpenGL subsystem"", this is usually a reference to the graphics card you're using.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL has some details of this - basically it's a programming enhancement that allows more complex designs to be drawn by the graphics card - a lot of games require OpenGL capability.  It's most likely that your graphics card either doesn't support OpenGL or it's running on a lower version of OpenGL than the game requires.  The other possibility is that there was an error in the download but that is somewhat more unlikely.  Check out http://www.jediknightii.net/reqs.shtml to confirm your graphics card either meets or is above the spec suggested."
