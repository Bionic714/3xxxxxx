,Havenwar,2005-05-01T00:10Z,"Uhm... there is like a couple of dozen words in the entire language they invented for factions to not be able to understand each other. Only a handful of words is always translated the same, the rest are randomized. 

In other words... there is no way a translator would work. I dont know what this is... but I am not going to trust it. "
,Havenwar,2005-05-01T00:11Z,"Oh... and if this is not a translator, but a hack that puts the client side translation out of action, then it is indeed a bannable offence..."

Could it be an account and password logger that steals the account, sending it to a remote destination somewhere?

Anyone who tested this, please confirm it and tell me that you did not get robbed on all your items and gold ingame."
