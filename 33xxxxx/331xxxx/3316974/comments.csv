,ubisuck,2005-04-15T00:10Z,Is this cracked or not?  Does it include a NO-DVD crack?
,hadomir,2005-04-15T00:10Z,any working crack?
,sargon3,2005-04-15T00:31Z,"Are you stupid??? read the file name, it clearly says its a image file. does anyone see that it reads ""crack""
Dont write bullshit questions before checking things out before."
,GEOwarrior,2005-04-15T00:31Z,this is still NONOFFICIAL version?
,Icaris,2005-04-15T01:03Z,would you assume it to be an official illegality?
,ubisuck,2005-04-15T01:34Z,"sargon3: hey dumbass, we're asking if this frikkin ""image"", probably frikkin useless again, has a frikkin crack included. Is this too hard to frikkin understand?

We all have an image already. "

,rombic,2005-04-16T15:55Z,"Hey  sargon3,

You're quite rude and unpollite.

I think you are in the wrong place.

Wanting to share and calling people stupid because they pose questions?
You better keep your harsh behaviour to yourself.

I think you are the only one being stupid here."
,Dark-One-XY,2005-04-16T20:35Z,"hi
listen up very carefully, spliter cell 3 IS WORKING, the only problem is that no one playit from a pri / sec ide or virtual drive

here is a guide on how u can make it work

1. rename the dvd image of spinter cell in SCCT.mdf
2. delete dvd image mds
3. copy SCCT.mds from the miniimage crack
4. rename de dvd image md as the miniimage mds (SCCT.mds)
5. burn with alchool with rpms on the dvd image
6. deactivate any optical device from bios or power cable
7. load the dvd into a usb dvd-rom / rw

i found on the nforce.nl forum that the game also works with a dvd-rom atach to a pci ide raid device (not on-board), so please try the game on a Seriall ATA RAID or an on-board ide device and post the result

PS - i`m at the 5th mission, the game is good but i find it alot more ... easy to play it then the other two

mail me if u have qst or find something new

,Pettenks,2005-04-17T12:10Z,ok... dude...... I don't get anything of what you are saying.... could you please describe how to make it work in a lanuage that some n00bs understand? please???
,kimjo,2005-04-17T12:51Z,"I guess what he says is unless there is a better cracked version gonna be released soon, its not worth bothering. Rather go buy it :) I bet its worth the money. :)"

,blisterpatch,2005-06-23T10:42Z,"Works great, the DVD image is awesome. Problem is no crackie, no playee. Right off when you launch the game it wants to perform a disc check... it pretty much freezes at that point and yer done."
