,mGoLos,2005-04-14T16:36Z,"Forget it, don't download this, it's useless.

Either wait for a proper release or buy the game, I'm not going to recommend you buy the game though, starforce leaves your system open to any jerk who can write a file with starforce clearance.

,Dark-One-XY,2005-04-16T20:37Z,"hi
listen up very carefully, spliter cell 3 IS WORKING, the only problem is that no one playit from a pri / sec ide or virtual drive

here is a guide on how u can make it work

1. rename the dvd image of spinter cell in SCCT.mdf
2. delete dvd image mds
3. copy SCCT.mds from the miniimage crack
4. rename de dvd image md as the miniimage mds (SCCT.mds)
5. burn with alchool with rpms on the dvd image
6. deactivate any optical device from bios or power cable
7. load the dvd into a usb dvd-rom / rw

i found on the nforce.nl forum that the game also works with a dvd-rom atach to a pci ide raid device (not on-board), so please try the game on a Seriall ATA RAID or an on-board ide device and post the result

PS - i`m at the 5th mission, the game is good but i find it alot more ... easy to play it then the other two

mail me if u have qst or find something new

,Isoarska,2005-04-18T14:15Z,Any working serials?
,Isoarska,2005-04-18T14:34Z,"shit, doesn't work :(  I burn it with Alcohol120% with rpms on and disabled ide devices on device manager/bios. Then I mounted image with Alcohol120% and installed the game but just don't work. It complains about keygen and error: 2Q4PL-S4YXN-QSULH-VR53S-SNH7F don't work, anything else I need to do to work the game run properly?  "

,negativeions,2005-05-25T14:42Z,"Fuck this game and fuck ubisoft... don't they know that people who pirate software most likely weren't going to buy it in the first place? It's the same with music... Just fucken eat shit... if you had any honour you'd let people get your game for free because the game you made was so awesome that people would be willing to give you money... but you're worthless pigs, just like every other developer, working within time constraints and with people whose entire heart is not necessarily into the project... fuck the entire industry... fuck capitalism to hell..."

,Clown029,2005-06-25T13:32Z,"Liiebo: love it.  
Isoarska: Only way this game has been working is people that have a external DVD USB drive like Dark-One-XY said.
negativeions: ummm I think the point of Ubisoft using Starforce was to piss of all the piraters and not let them play, yes they hoped to convert some to buying.  But still think the main goal was to piss the piraters off.
Be patient crack will come, took months for 2nd sight crack and that was starforce protected."
,makexp,2005-06-29T17:39Z,this dosn't work!! this is shit!!!don't download!
,Diakkan,2005-07-19T00:58Z,"its useless to even look for the crack, the copy protection protects about 200 files(not just *.exe) so no one wants to mess with it....
""""""""THERE IS NO PROPER CRACK EXISTS""""""""""
you can wait for a crack for a several month..
my advice is: just go buy the original one, it worth it!"

,ogUr,2006-01-06T22:36Z,Two words: don't download. This version doesn't work. If you want to play the game then you have to download snake's image.
,MichaelCorleone,2006-01-06T23:16Z,"I wouldn't disregard this copy of Splinter Cell completely. I am sure there will be a crack created sometime soon. It is OK to download, but as far as being playable just be patient."
,ogUr,2006-01-07T21:34Z,There isn't crack and there won't be. Only way is using sfnightmare or unplug power cables.
,MichaelCorleone,2006-01-08T03:51Z,How would you know there is no crack coming? Very negative.
,ogUr,2006-01-08T14:45Z,Fuck. The game has 10 months and you still belive that crack is coming? No comment :) Belive if you want but I don't.
,MichaelCorleone,2006-01-08T19:44Z,"Forget it, I just found a crack for this game. Great installment to the Splinter Cell series."
[V],baboo335,2006-01-17T21:11Z,where did you find that crack?
,ogUr,2006-01-20T12:26Z,"yeah, right... there's no crack. MichaelCorleone wants to show us that he's the smartest guy and he found working crack. Strange... Nobody for 10 months didn't find it but MichaelCorleone did it in couple of days. If somebody downloaded this version try this way: 1. burn image with the newest alcohol. 2. make image from already burned dvd (tick on ONLY option about read errors). 3. instal the game from the new image. 4. reboot. 5. install 1.04 US patch (optionaly but it only should help). 6. run sfnightmare - 'disable node' and 'disable cd'. run sfafsb (install and start (sfafsb must run when you're playing)). 6. use 2Q4PL-S4YXN-QSULH-VR53S-SNH7F (if doesn't work try without '-'). 7. Play. 
Works for me and my friends. Try as long as you can. Friend said that it isn't work but some days later he played 2nd mission ;-)))"
,Compoxid,2006-01-23T16:53Z,"Listen guys! Why make it so complicated when you can just install the game, pull out the powersupply for your cd roms and just play? It's the absolute easiest way to play the game.. Just mount the image in Deamon Tools, disconnect the power from your cd roms and play the game.."

nobody cares!!"
,skythegeek,2006-01-26T21:10Z,"Ok ok maybe that was a little harsh, if you want to use the crack I just made I just hacked the FTP password of some random web site and uploaded the file.
