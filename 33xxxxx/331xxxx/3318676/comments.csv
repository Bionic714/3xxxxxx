,Bollan911,2005-04-19T00:23Z,Well if you dont like the release just dont bother to download it. The only way the rippers can get some credit for their hard work is to put an addon to the filenames so just accept it or bu the album. Try Tag & Rename if it bothers you wich is a great app for tagging the files as you wish. Keep up the brilliant work as always FEFE!!!!! :guns:
,mutual_aid,2005-04-19T01:14Z,"Woah, watch out, a smilie with machine guns!  What frustrates me is that I feel I'm being advertized at when the 'group name' is a webaddress.  I think ID3 comment tags and NFOs should be enough recognition.  And the group name in the filename is okay.  But all advertizing sux!  Peace"
