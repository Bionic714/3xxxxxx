,paulieglott,2011-10-05T02:07Z,"Indeed!  Pollini is not only a great technician, but an impeccable, sensitive interpreter as well.  His performances never succumb to being mere bravura displays of virtuosity.  He always brings out the musicality of whatever work he's performing, and this set is an excellent example of that.  He's definitely (one of) my favorite pianist(s).  I think it's quite fair to say that he is to the piano what Yo Yo Ma is to the cello."
