,Battleship,2006-11-28T16:20Z,"LoL this torrent is DEAD!!!!!!!Too bad, I love celtic kings :rage of war and i love punic wars' demo, but I havent found any other working torrent so far for this game, noone has it in my country , who could upload it to any of my local *officical* ftps and i have no idea where to get this game!(did I forgot to mention that i havent seen it in any of my local stores either!-lol)

PS:If you live in america or something, you can get the game free from trygames.com and crack its trial period.However, i live in one of the smaller countrys of europe and can't download from there:(.I tried through several proxy servers which were located in other countrys but no luck.
Also tryfreegames.com is  down, which used to upload trialgames as torrents.
BTW there  was a nemesis torrent on isohunt.com, but since the afro-mentioned website who used to host them solely, is down, its no good."
,vladswell,2006-12-23T14:43Z,Woohoo!!! I live in North America thank you Battleship!!!! btw I also love Celtic Kings Thanks!!!
,anton20andersson,2007-04-26T00:41Z,"Hej alla svenskar! Om ni fortfarande vill ha spelet kan ni köpa det ganska billigt på discshop.se, det verkar ju som spelet är ganska svårt att få tag på här på internet, bara en massa jävla döda torrents. =)
