,srw567,2007-03-18T08:06Z,All of these look SO nice yet they're never seeded..how agravating! It would GREAT if the original poster would repost or if anyone who has a version of this can post. Note to tages: Winamp has a plugin for these type of files and I highly recommend you get the freeware of the FLAC frontend and MKW decoders from the internet. VERY handy
