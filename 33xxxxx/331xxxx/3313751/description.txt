<p><td><b>Synopsis</b>During spring 1943 they took to the
war-torn skies for the most dangerous mission in defence of freedom. If
the ten-man crew of the bomber <i>Memphis Belle</i> returned, they
would receive a hero’s welcome and renew flagging public morale. But
the odds were stacked heavily against them in the true, courageous
story of the brave “fly-boys” who each fought mortal fear while
fighting the enemy together.</p>

<img src="http://www.dvdanswers.com/images/screenshots/belle1.jpg" alt="" height="230" width="385"></center><b>Video</b>Contrary
to the packaging, Memphis Belle is presented in non-anamorphic 1.66:1,
not 1.85:1. The quality of the video is highly variable, with some
scenes faring better than others. There are numerous scratches on the
print, which detract from the overall enjoyment, and there seems to be
an odd reddish/pink tint to the picture, but this isn’t <i>the</i>
worst transfer I've ever seen. It’s certainly better than VHS, and
although it lacks the definition of an anamorphic transfer, the detail
level is acceptable throughout. For those who prefer them, the disc
also contains a pan-and-scan transfer on side B.<center>
<img src="http://www.dvdanswers.com/images/screenshots/belle2.jpg" alt="" height="230" width="385"></center><b>Audio</b>The
English Dolby Digital 5.1 is fairly good, and succeeds in drawing you
into the action. It could perhaps have benefited from a bit more bass
during the airborne combat though. There are some great opportunities
for surround effects during these sections, but these don’t live up to
their full potential. Dialogue sometimes gets lost amongst the rest of
the sound, and it all sounds a bit muddy at times.<b>Extras</b>As
is usual for this sort of back catalogue disc, extras are almost
non-existent. Once again scene access is laughably claimed as an
“extra”, but the only real feature on offer is the theatrical trailer. <center>
<img src="http://www.dvdanswers.com/images/screenshots/belle3.jpg" alt="" height="232" width="385"></center><b>Overall</b>While
not a bad film, Memphis Belle isn’t really my cup of tea. On the other
hand, both my girlfriend and her sister love it, so it most certainly
has an audience out there. The picture is slightly lacking, but
non-anamorphic video isn’t particularly impressive at the best of
times. The audio has it’s moments, but is let down by some weak bass
and muddled dialogue. Obviously the extras aren’t going to earn the
disc any awards either. Basically fans of the film you could do a lot
worse than pick this disc up, but others would be advised to rent
first.</td>
