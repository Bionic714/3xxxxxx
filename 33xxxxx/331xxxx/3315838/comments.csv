,penol,2005-04-12T18:51Z,"Dear Redhawk!! This movie is NOT made in Hollywood. It's made by the european director Luc Besson (i.e Leon etc.). Whether it ia a remake or not, I personally think it's one of the funniest movies ever from european director. Nice Relase by the way ;-)"

Normally when I download a movie, people can easily download parts from me.

This is my first release...

This is a french movie but made in US! aka Taxi N.Y.C.
And not by Luc Besson, he 'only' wrote the first screenplay for it.
