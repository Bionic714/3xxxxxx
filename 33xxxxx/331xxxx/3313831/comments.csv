,DogshitTaco,2005-04-10T09:51Z,"Hmmm... Ok, so someone already put up DS9 s1-s2?
Why didn't they name the torrents so ppl can find them?

,V4Friend,2008-01-20T12:04Z,"Hey guys and girls,

I seeded until availability was higher than 2.

I really expect you to take it over from there and SEED.

I don't mind leechers, cause we all start out that way, but leechers MUST turn into seeders to keep the torrents healthy..."
