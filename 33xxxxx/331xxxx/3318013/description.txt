(for WinNT/2K/XP/2003)
Password protect your workstation or server while viewing programs that are running. Any attempts to access the system will display a message box to request the password. Prevent access via CRTL-ALT-DEL. Log file tracks failed login attempts, and can initiate shutdown/logoff. Save log file locally, to network or to Event Log. Use quick-launch icon to enable password protection anytime, or run at a preset time interval. Option to grant system access to Administrators and/or other authenticated users without closing the current session. "PRO" version is ideal for protecting multiple-user shared computers, and for high-security environments that require Adminstrative access and control. NEW version 4.00 provides additional control over how the password dialog box is displayed, including: automatically populate the username field, restrict access to users of one domain only, and configure a timeout value. Added support for alternate characters on international keyboards in the password.
