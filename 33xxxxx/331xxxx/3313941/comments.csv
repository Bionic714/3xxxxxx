[T],trollfan,2005-04-10T04:45Z,"Wait... you said that the first game came to NES? But SEGA is making the games, right? That doesn't make any sense!"

,kfc,2008-10-28T20:42Z,"To clarify... Puyo Puyo was originally released in 1991 by a company named Compile. However after they went out of business in 2002, Sonic Team (i.e. SEGA) continued to develop the series. Unfortunately they've chosen to slaughter the gameplay and corrupt the ingenious original idea with their fever-mode, three- and four-puyo-pieces, and tacky characters and graphics. Everybody should really check out the original ""Puyo Puyo"" (a.k.a. ""Kirby's avalanche"" and ""Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine"") or ""Puyo Puyo Tsu (2)"" on SEGA Mega Drive (Genesis) or SNES, which are my favorite incarnations of the game. They are also available on the brilliant compilation ""Puyo Puyo Box"" for the PSOne, which might be more accessible for most people.

,kfc,2008-10-28T20:50Z,"Oh yeah, if you own a Nintendo Game Cube, you can check out ""Sonic Mega Collection"". It's a compilation of old Genesis/Mega Drive games based on the Sonic characters. Except for the classic ""Sonic the Hedgehod"" games ""Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine"" is also available among the titles :-)"
