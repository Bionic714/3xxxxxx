The Puyo Puyo series has been an extremely popular puzzle series in Japan that began in the days of the NES. Unfortunately, most of them haven't made it over to the US, at least, not with the Puyo Puyo name. The most notable appearances of the series in the states are Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine for the Sega Genesis and Kirby's Avalanche for the Super Nintendo, both of which just slapped new names onto the classic style of gameplay.
