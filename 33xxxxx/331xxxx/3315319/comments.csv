,flash_boy,2006-07-16T23:30Z,"The film is not dubbed to german, that is the film original language. The film where made in two versions, one in english and one in german. Sometimes but not often IMDB has wrong, like in this case, but if you watch this film it is obviously that the actors speeks german.
The english subtitles sucks, I would like to know if the person who made those speaks neither german or english, because he or she lacks of knowledge in both languages."

,funkystuff08,2008-03-07T00:22Z,"Can someone with knowledge of German and English write another set of English subs for this film? I would, if I knew German. It's difficult to follow the plot with the current set of subs."
,madbam666,2010-11-07T17:33Z,"The english subs are horrible, it is not worth watching without knowing german."
