,jediwillow,2005-07-20T07:28Z,"can some of you adjust your upload speed or stop some other torrents that you might be downloading, as I'm only downloading in bytes & uploading between 5-10 k/b...
At this rate it will take me 3 months to d/l the last 15% (300 m/b) that I need."

,bubu11,2006-07-13T13:54Z,"please seed please,,99.9%"
,longs,2006-08-13T18:40Z,"I was able to get it to work at 99.9%. Extract all the folders except the xwavebank folder. Now extract the xwavebank next. It will extract all the files correctly except the ""0ddc11ff"" file. It will expand"
,longs,2006-08-13T18:42Z, It will expand until your drive is full. To get by this delete the file and extract it by it self for exactly 4 seconds.
,longs,2006-08-13T18:43Z,Then manually close the xiso program to keep the file from expanding to big. Do this until you get the file under 200 mb.
,longs,2006-08-13T18:46Z,"Copy the Default XBE files first, then all the folders except xwavebank. Copy it over to the xbox last and reboot. It should then work."
,longs,2006-08-13T18:47Z,It took many times to figure out how to get it to work but I finally defeated it. Let me know if anyone have problems.
