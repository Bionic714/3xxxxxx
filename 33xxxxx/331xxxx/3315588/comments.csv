,bejjo,2005-07-10T01:01Z,Detta är en IBM version av DOS6.22.
,mogto,2006-09-02T18:46Z,"Ok, I actually downloaded and checked (unlike you guys).

This is MS-DOS 7.10.  It's consistently referred to as such.

The version of DOS on Windows 95 is consistently referred to as ""MS-DOS 7.1"".  That is, seven point ONE.  This is seven point TEN.

And it's not IBM PC-DOS.  My knowledge of DOS is not good enough to say for absolutely sure, but the license and the install .bat file claims it's licensed under the GNU GPL(!).

And I have a vague recollection that a 7.10 version was the version targeting the Japanese market, or some such.  The FILE_ID.DIZ inside the first archive seems to say it's distributed by the ""China DOS Union"".

So, from my limited knowledge I'd say 7.10 is a late version of MS-DOS, patched to handle multibyte characters."
,MovieHunter,2006-10-07T22:17Z,"En fråga (som jag antar kan låta lite dum):
Är detta en svensk version av MS-DOS?

A question (that I guess could sound a little stupid):
Is this a swedish version of MS-DOS?"
