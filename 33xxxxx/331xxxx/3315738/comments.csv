,john5678,2008-12-23T13:32Z,"Greenbaum later said : ""I thought, 'Yeah, I could do that,' knowing nothing about gospel music, so I sat down and wrote my own gospel song. It came easy. I wrote the words in 15 minutes.""[1]

""Spirit in the Sky"" contains lyrics about the afterlife, making several references to Jesus. However, Greenbaum, who identifies himself as Jewish, stated that he had no particular religious intentions with the song.[2] He simply wanted to reach a bigger market.
