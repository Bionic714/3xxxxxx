Live from The Forum, Camden Town, London on 12 December 2003

The Oysters, touring the world with their energetic folk-pop music, have played more than 2300 shows in about 800 cities, in 35 countries, on 5 continents.

Notes:

 Audio tracks (stereo AC3) demuxed from DVD, converted to WAV and recompressed with Vorbis quality level 6. Will play gaplessly in a good player, like say http://www.foobar2000.org

 Track 19 is from the separate "live video" included on this DVD.
