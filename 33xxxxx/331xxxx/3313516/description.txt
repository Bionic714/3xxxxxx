A real classic, lots of deep bass and heavy beats in this one :) A few years back Hollywood used these tunes in what felt like every action movie and trailer...

Even though it's from 1997, it's still rockin' and is one of my favourite electronic music albums. Download if you haven't heard it before! =)

All tunes are VBR ~200 kbps true stereo.


Review from Amazon.com:

When Ken Jordan and Scott Kirkland started distributing homemade singles around Los Angeles at the beginning of the '90s, their bass-fortified, hard-rolling techno concoctions perked up the ears of industry impresarios and local scenesters alike. Vegas, their affectionately-titled major label debut, refines the formula. Thick with layers of pounding beats and rock dynamics, it takes the typical club fare and beefs it up with a uniquely western slant. The detectable influences range from the power chords of AC/DC to old school hip-hop patterns to the smooth melodies of Stevie Wonder. On blistering tracks like "Trip Like I Do" and "Keep Hope Alive," the Crystal Method confirm that America has become a force of contention in the electronica field. --Aidin Vaziri
