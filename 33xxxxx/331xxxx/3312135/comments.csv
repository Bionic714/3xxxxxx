I tried using a swedish to english dictionary, and the results were absurd...half the words don't exist, and the other half mean two things to me; Jack and shit...and jack left town.

Could someone tell me which stat on the tracker is the one for total number of completed downloads...NOT how many time the torrent has been downloaded, but the files associated with the torrent (The movie itself).

Thanks."
