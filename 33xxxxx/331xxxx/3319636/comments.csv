[T],sickboy88,2005-04-21T09:08Z,Exactly...WORD FOR WORD...just what you said!
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-21T09:08Z,"BTW, what did you say?"
,Rasulmin,2005-04-21T09:17Z,He wants you to seed it.:P
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-21T09:17Z,"Hey everyone,

Just so you know, tracker.prq.to still isn't resolving into an IP correctly.  

What you can do, is edit your hosts file, by adding this line:

83.140.65.2 tracker.prq.to

Assuming you're running XP, that would be:

c:windowssystem32driversetchosts

Since The Pirate Bay is such a large tracker, it would be in everyone's interest to add this to their hosts file, incase another DNS failure occurs.  This will fix the problem in 2 seconds, and let you connect to the tracker for torrents not using the temp announce url of http://tracker.thepiratepay.org/announce...Fun stuff."
,orgpunk,2005-04-21T10:18Z,"I trust you. And I love you for seeding this movie. To bad I wont get since I dont understand shit about ""host"" and stuff."
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-21T10:47Z,"Orgpunk,

No, don't worry about that.  I am using the new temp tracker that resolves: tracker.thepiratebay.org

You DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING FOR THIS TORRENT TO WORK.

Just click on it, it will work.

The hosts file fix is only for torrents using: tracker.trq.to"
,stuffee,2005-04-21T11:43Z,Isn't this the right IMDb link? http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290673/
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-21T11:55Z,"I was comparing my movie to the rape scene in the movie you just listed the link to.  The movie I am sharing is at the very top of the description.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077713/"
,retro,2005-04-21T12:29Z,"this movie is very lame and not good in any way. maybe if you like rape, but then you should seek help instead.
not even her revenge is cool...."
,Rasulmin,2005-04-21T13:25Z,"I have to agree with you retro, the movie is kinda lame but that is just my opinion.
Btw. thanx for the tip with the ""host"" thing, works perfect now:D"
,orgpunk,2005-04-21T15:38Z,"I thought this was the movie with the rape of a deaf girl and a sister (?) going for revenge. That movie is very important in the swedish filmhistory since it was one of the reasons for the swedish filmcensour, the texas chainsaw massacer being the second reason. It was ok for men to take revenge for having their wifes raped, but not for women to  themself to do so on the screen."
,jockiboy,2005-04-21T18:36Z,"um .. cool ! hope it isn't as LAME as ""open water"", that flick sucked bigtime !! um .. yeah ."
,Werm,2005-04-22T00:01Z,"On my personal list of the best all time 'extreme' films. Very brutal stuff. 

I've seen this a few times before but am curious if I've really seen it totally uncut...  Thanks for posting."
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-22T03:03Z,"Werm,

If you can scare up the version you've seen in the past,  just for shits and giggles, please let me know the runtime, and region if dvd. If you can't recall, then no big deal. Thanks."
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-22T21:52Z,"haha, yeah.  Thanks.  I'll look into those two movies, I've never heard of them.

Look for my next torrent...it's going to be 10x worse than this one."
,Zenaphobe,2005-04-23T12:44Z,"I got this one many months ago..Uncut.  There are bits in the film, where you need to hangon to yer dick :-8 "
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-27T22:58Z,"I can do this one:

The Untold Story

Let me know how you want the subs done.  I'd prefer to just hard encode them into the movie."
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-28T10:34Z,"As in, let me know fucking soon, I'm encoding it in the next 2 days. ;)"
,Bacon2000,2005-06-11T22:37Z,"Nice! Good to see some quality out there!
