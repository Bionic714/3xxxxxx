Yes, the UNCUT version, which is banned all over the globe.  It's not really that bad...I wouldn't ban it.  People want to bitch about the rape scene in the French movie: Irreversible (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290673/) but this movie blows it away.  It's like one 40 minute rape, followed by all kinds of sick revenge acts.  You have to see this.

Director Meir Zarchi's revenge movie has the dubious honor of containing one of the longest and most violent gang-rape scenes on film. When writer Jenny Hill (Camille Keaton) rents a remote cabin, she's surprised to find that the local townsfolk are friendly -- too friendly, in fact. What follows is decidedly unpleasant: After being brutalized, violated and left for dead, Jenny goes on her own spree of killing, mutilation and castration.

I don't know...I kind of felt like joining in on some of the scenes....there was just something about how stupid she was...You know? ;)
