and just in case you want to get a legal version for only €8 (instead of 34):
register for a free reg-code for v7.54 at http://www.opera.com/ct-magazin using code ""OJD000MN""
soon the very same page should offer an upgrade to v8 (probably starting tuesday)
come on, 8 bucks is fucking cheap, and it's worth it"

Men varför ansluter BitComet aldrig till någon seed!? Håller på att bli knäpp då jag inte har kunnat ladda ner på några dagar. Jag har lyssningsporten helt öppen mot min dator men ändå inget... :("

,NeoSamurai,2005-04-23T10:08Z,"Funkar inte för mig, när jag startar Opera kommer skicka inte grejen och den stängs av varje gång."
,RedSaint,2005-05-11T17:08Z,"best browser. last time when I was really wasted, I downloaded this, and started babbling to my friends about this being the rolls royce of browsers :D

dunno why I would ever download this torrent though. a regular 7.54 keygen which I use, have worked for every version of the downloadable opera version from the homepage. all betas, everything without trouble.

thanks for the tip k-t-m, but I have no way of paying in dollars. actually I don't even have enough money for food atm. which just illustrates how fucked I am O_O

bit-comet is teh suck. sorry to say this, because I was also once fascinated with this client, as it doesn't use as many resources as Azureus. unfortunately it can emulate other clients so the user don't have to install certain other clients to join some trackers - or was that another client? well, the thing with this client is that it doesn't report the right amount of uploaded and downloaded data to the tracker, so your profile wouldn't be updated correctly. that could fuck up onces profile ratio, and give the wrong statistics.."
