This is in SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on a 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play in the proper aspect ratio use the little programme included it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files.

If you have nero installed then it has a box you can tick to burn it to NTSC(american video standard)
