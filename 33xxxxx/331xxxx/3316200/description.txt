One hundred years ago, the residents of a small town in upstate New York were drowned when a massive dam was built and the town along with the surrounding valley was flooded for the creation of Rushford Lake. The Restless souls of the drowned still reside at the bottom of the lake and every thirteenth year they rise from the deep with an insatiable appetite for the souls of the living.
