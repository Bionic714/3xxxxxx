,lw_guy,2005-04-04T16:29Z,"Sorry for the lack of native language response... this is a non-album track, only available to those attending the special Interscope records pre-release parties in the USA. It's only available here (128k, yeah I know...) or on the Vinyl 'Hand That Feeds' album they give away at these shows... sorry mate."
