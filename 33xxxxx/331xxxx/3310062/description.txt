The companion CDROM for the book Game Programming Gems 5 (ISBN 1584503521)

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1584503521

Note: It's the CDROM only, not an OCR of the book itself. Even so, I thought some might find it interesting.

I've stripped out most of the redistributable stuff (DirectX, GLUT, Java)
