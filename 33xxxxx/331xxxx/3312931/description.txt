Trevor Adams (Ben Foster) was a model student until extreme bullying drove him to threaten to bomb the high school football team. Now Trevor's a time bomb himself--troubled, misunderstood, and on the brink of committing real violence. Salvation comes in the form of a caring drama teacher named Mr. Duncan (Tom Cavanagh), who offers Trevor the lead in the school play. But when the community gets wind of the play's subject matter--school violence and playground killers--as well as its troubled protagonist, the production is in jeopardy, as is Trevor's attempt to avoid calamity. This gritty, hard-hitting drama offers an authentic glimpse inside the post-Columbine high schools of America and the forces that can compel a teen to violence.
