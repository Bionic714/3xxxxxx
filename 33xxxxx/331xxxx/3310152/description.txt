Daydreams is Gentry's first soloalbum.

Gentry Morris has been influenced by many artist and many different musical genres, from the classical southern rock of Creedence and Skynard to the new age music of John Mayer, Matchbox Twenty, and David Gray. Gentry borrows from all to form his own unique sound.

Gentry blends the angst of youthful years and lost loves with optimism for a better tomorrow. His acoustic stylings reach into the soul and speak to the hearts of anyone who has ever lost a love.
