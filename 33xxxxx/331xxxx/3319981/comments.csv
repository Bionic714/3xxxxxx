I uploaded a fresh one.  Simply point your client to what you have downloaded already, and let it hash it again, and away we go."
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-22T06:16Z,"HEY! Have windows xp sp2?  Don't like the fact that you no longer have raw socket access?  How about the fact that you now only have a MAX of 10 half-open connections?

Well you can't do shit about the first issue, but the second one YOU CAN.

Use this patch to set your max half-open connections BACK to 50...or enter a custom number...like 100, which is actually perfect.  Watch those torrents FLY!

Of course, this should speed up everything else as well.

Did you do the pipelining tweek on firefox?  Guess what?  Hard to have 30 open connections to a web page, when you are limited to 10.  Run this patch, then give it a whirl.  

You'll shit yourself.
