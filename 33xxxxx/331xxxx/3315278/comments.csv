On the positive side this might actually be the best lan poker game available, since there are basically no others.  Also if it were this or nothing I'd take this.  

Here are the reviews I could find, and they basically nuke this game:

and finally some user reviews:

I just hope Moneymaker was payed a lot to have his name abused like this."
