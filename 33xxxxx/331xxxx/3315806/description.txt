GREAT FUN!!!! crazy sixties hollywood party.......

An Indian actor screws up royally during the filming of a costume epic. When the 'Fire this guy' list gets confused with the studio head's guest list for a party, he appears there and everyone assumes he must belong. A great many sight gags and misunderstanding gags are played out at the party where the rest of the film takes place.
