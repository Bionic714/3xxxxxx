,Shinidamachuu,2005-08-13T19:01Z,Sounds fun :D
,gruubii,2006-01-06T21:56Z,"Could I get a seed please, im at 88% after 3 weeks of trying to grab this."
,Podings,2007-01-01T20:08Z,This REALLY isn't funny. I'm just warning y'all. It's a severe case of trying too hard. Watch it only if you take pride in being described as a drooling j-pop fan-freak with a love for clichĂŠ characters and worn thin satire.
,Ushinobu,2008-11-03T21:33Z,lol Podings. I hope you know that this and Excel Saga are meant to be that way. They make fun of all the stereotypical elements in anime. It isn't meant to be taken serious.
,zackzeals,2008-11-23T20:09Z,is puni puni poemy torrent in English?
,Kairyuka,2009-07-30T23:08Z,"Podings, it seems you just don't get the sick and twisted humor of Nabeshin's creations (._.)
This is actually fun for people like me (retarded otaku xD)"
,VashSnake,2010-03-14T02:38Z,Love it.
,Dourig,2010-03-26T17:10Z,"sadly its censored, anyone know of a uncensored one? "
,Tettsui,2011-03-21T02:07Z,"This anime kicks balls(seriously plenty of 'em)
it's awfully retarded and annoying and 100% of the most stupid randomness. 
In one word:AWESOME"
