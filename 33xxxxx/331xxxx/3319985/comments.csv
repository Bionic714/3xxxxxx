This is bullshit!!!

,QuantumDriven,2008-12-10T21:29Z,"This works!
I got the 90.4% shit, too.
But it went to My Downloads and played.

It IS COMPLETE, but 9.6% is ruined and it skips through those parts after freezing up."
,mrt999,2009-11-19T09:44Z,"It doesnt work even if you re- encode the 90% that downloads
Im Pretty Dissapointed about this i used up my last bit of data allowance on this. Someone should at least remove it so no one else has to be dissapointed"
,salagadam,2010-03-02T16:32Z,this torrent has no seeder. you can only download %90.4 of this video. it is enough to watch but you can find better torrent of this great documentary.
,DonAlfrito,2010-12-02T04:30Z,"People in 2007 were getting stuck at 90.4% and guess what? Now in 2010 people are still getting stuck at 90.4%
