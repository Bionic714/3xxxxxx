,justtogetarep,2006-09-04T13:21Z,Heard about this movie from a friend today. Some say it is the best film dealing with the passion story.
,slumcat,2009-04-07T17:03Z,The quality is very good with perfect hard-coded English subs. This is indeed supposed to be the best film about Christ and his suffering.
