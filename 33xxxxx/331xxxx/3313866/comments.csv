,zarathustra2k1,2009-04-15T03:57Z,"TYVM for the upload. =]

P.S.Ane fule kno taht teh VLC is teh bestest.
In other words:

@ 'MYDAMAYE': You don't need to install ANY codecs with VLC, numbnuts! By saying it's shit, you just prove what a flaming fucktard you REALLY are.

Just carry on installing your top-heavy bloatware codec packs, but don't opine on the matter when you know jack-shit about it - or, for that matter, tell others to follow your slack-jawed, pin-headed ALL-CAPS ""advice"" - mkay? MKAY!
