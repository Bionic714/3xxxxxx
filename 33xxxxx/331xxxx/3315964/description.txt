This is a great bootleg with lots of rarities, such as Love Me Tender(!).

This text taken from the cd cover insleeve:

December 1968: The Doors begin to record their new album (The Soft Parade). The sessions and the recording process for this album went out of control and took too long. They worked on the album for nine months. June 1969: the album was finished and got published in July.

On February 25th, 1969, they recorded "Rock is Dead", a collage of different pieces of music put together in an hour-long session. They played blues, rock 'n' roll, latin. surf, something we later call rap, they did pop and even jazz.

The session published on this CD will blow your minds off. You'll hear the complete uncut version of the Doors' Rock is Dead -session, including TWO very different versions of another song the band intended to put on The Soft Parade: "Whiskey, Mystics and Men", published for the first time on record.

What you have in your hands now is the real thing. Uncut, no overdubs, in it's best available soundquality. "Mystic Man" should be placed right between "Waiting For the Sun" and "The Soft Parade".
