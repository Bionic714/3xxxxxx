<p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Carl and James are two pleasant but 
unambitious garbage men. Carl has a telescope with which he observes his 
neighbors. One evening he sees a man giving a female neighbor a hard time. As 
she leaves he shoots the man with a pellet gun. Hiding, he and James miss two 
men strangling the man and leaving with the body. When he appears in a can on 
their route they are afraid and hide the body, fearing that they may be 
implicated in the death. Trying to crack the case, they spy on the woman, join 
up with a slightly to majorly crazed vietnam vet, kidnap a pizza man and help to 
protect the ecology.</b></font></p>
