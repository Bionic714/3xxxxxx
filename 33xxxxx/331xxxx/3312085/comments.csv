,RoughWaves,2005-04-06T01:12Z,"Thanks a lot for your uploads! You most seriously are the pumpkin king!
I registered just so I could say that!

I'm also permanently seeding 3 of the dvds at random. 
I have season2 to current (except s2d5). If someone could let me know where I would be most helpful?

Thanks again, look forward to future uploads!
Maybe not voyager... but ds9 :)"
,DogshitTaco,2005-04-06T06:24Z,"heh heh... :)
I will get both Voyager and DS9. 
But right now, i'm focused on TNG.
I'm afraid i haven't the harddrives or the bandwidth to do more than i'm already doing... :-/"
