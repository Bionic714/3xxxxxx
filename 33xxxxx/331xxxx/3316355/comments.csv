,Hednoize,2005-04-13T19:52Z,limited edition? how is it limited?
,Bracchus,2005-04-13T20:20Z,Is the version where they have removed all the movies?
,Lyrisius,2005-04-13T20:21Z,"Its limited in that way that it hasnt got all the levels that the regular game has....just kidding.

You get an extra character to play in the game.

Thx for the torrent dude!!!"
,Hednoize,2005-04-13T20:28Z,"limited cant mean that u get an extra character.
anyone know how it's limited? on nforce.nl i saw that one of the other releases which is alot smaller than this one has its movies removed. since this is alot bigger, maybe it has the movies? but what could be limited then?"
,Ms.Viktoria,2005-04-13T20:31Z,"Jag försöker att ladda upp DVD9
Och hare radan laddat upp det, och seedat men ser den ej, tar det lång tid innan den kommer upp?"
,Lyrisius,2005-04-13T20:35Z,"Wow, it must be a strain for some people to like use the internet as an information source.
The Jade Empire Limited Edition clearly states that it contains one xtra character and an extra fighting style. Its limited in how many thay make, not what it doesnt contain.

OMG, I cant belive that its so hard to look that up."
,de99ytth,2005-04-13T20:40Z,Lägg gärna upp DVD9!!!
,Ms.Viktoria,2005-04-13T20:45Z,"Har redan gjort!
Men det vägrar synas. Och jag har gjort precis som jag gjorde förut. Det står att det är OK och allting är OK.

Men förstår inte varför det inte syns"
,marrow,2005-04-13T20:49Z,"This relese have most off the in game movies deleted! and that sucks,, playing a rpg without knowing the main storry normely does

i cant understand why they dident yust downsample the movies there would have bean enouge space!!"
,psyddicus,2005-04-13T21:07Z,"I'm going to be downsampling the movies for myself when I get the DVD9.

As for the LE stuff...The Limited Edition of Jade Empire comes with a 2nd DVD that you use to insert the extra character and fighting style into the regular game.  Regardless of whether you get the DVD9 or this DVD5, you NEED the Jade Empire Bonus disc to access the extras."
,tangled,2005-04-13T21:41Z,"Is there any chance any group could make the movies (downsampled, or something) fit on a dvd-5?
My HD is too small for the dvd-9 version and I'd hate to miss parts of the story..."
,Helladude,2005-04-13T22:51Z,"Upgrade Hard Drive to 120Gb £40
Buy the game £30
Buy a Dual Layered DVD £2.50
Bitch cause nobody downsampled the movies for you FREE

"
,Hednoize,2005-04-14T00:26Z,"everyone has to get so irritated on everything? so what if somone wants it downsampled. whats wrong with asking for that?

tangled: ur hd is to small? sure u dont have a game ur not playing that u can delete? i have something like a 40gb and its never a problem. but then i dont play that many games at once either.."
,Mr_B,2005-04-14T11:25Z,Does this release have everything or not?? I'm getting confused here. 
,vane505,2005-04-14T12:11Z,Limited Edition Gör att du får en extra karaktär (en slags munk) samt att man får en extra vapenstil (spadenågonting). Tack för releasen :D
,madpaddy,2005-04-14T12:19Z,PLZZZZ can peeps seed this game help the other peeps to help you .And one more thing if you add this and the bonus disc together they nearly same as dvd9 ver is that becouse this has all the bits except the exrta cd ????.

,zolimester,2005-04-14T13:28Z,i don´t want it play without movies but i dont want to buy it too.
,NigoMan,2005-04-14T19:46Z,"Is it in English?`

,n20,2005-04-14T19:50Z,the movies and in game cutscenes were removed. look out for someone to downsample the dvd9 version soon.
