,backdrop,2005-04-16T21:34Z,"Yup, this is a nice ""movie"" or rather: dramatised educational movie about the incomprehendable consequences of a nuclear war. You'll actually follow a group of people up close, as well as a whole community and country, leading up to the conflict and what exactly happens to them afterwards... It's no picnic... brr..."

,MrDestructo,2005-04-19T05:36Z,"another rare movie that needs to be found : Special Bulletin (only released as ntsc vhs) if anyone has it, get it put up!

i watched Threads on an anniversary of the japanese bombing and it horrified me then, gave me the knowledge of just what will happen to civvies in a nuke war"

,dirtycar74,2006-09-20T05:27Z,"Re-Seed, Please!!

I remember this movie from when I was a kid, and have been looking for it ever since I have been old enough to buy my own movies and what-not.  It's a good thing to share in today's post-9/11 world, as a reminder of where we almost went, and where we could still yet go if the Iran thing and the Korea thing don't get resolved..."
,munkybutt,2006-10-27T15:36Z,"I have just watched this for the second time in my life. This drama has haunted me throughout the years. I think that everyone should see this film. The futility of a nuclear conflict.

As a movie buff, I have watched endless horror films to the point at which I am no longer shocked.

This drama, however, has shocked me even in 2006. It is gritty, it is realistic, it does not have a feel good factor & neither does it have the USA ""we are right"" values.

I remember the leaflets & the propaganda dished out in the 1980's. 

Apart from the really old cars, rubiks cube & an early version of PSP...  many events are still true even today... Middle East conflict, missiles in Iran, N.Korea. 

This drama/film, is as valid today as it was when it was made & aired on the TV.

Thankyou to whoever uploaded this."
,Osaka,2006-11-14T21:03Z,"@ dirtycar74

This ""movie"" is more of a sneak-peak into what it will be like when your goverment decide to de-populate the planet and put the people not affected by the bombs (and survivors) into compact cities like in 1984 where they will be monitored constantly.

Of course, they could use conventional and/or biological weapons to get rid of the majority of the human race, but that would take longer time.

Nuclear ""war"" seems more likely to happen."
,Verwandlung-,2007-09-18T21:43Z,"Please re-seed this movie,

thank you"
,mogster82,2008-06-15T05:51Z,"Brilliant. One of the most important programs/films ever made. I think only the British could make a kitchen-sink drama out of a nuclear holocaust. If Coronation Street did an episode where the world ends, it might look like this."
,Griezel,2008-08-14T06:10Z,"I hope this torrent will stay active for a few extra weeks. My downloadlimit is almost ... gone :), and the month is barely halfway.

Thanx to all seeders.

Thanks for the upload in the first place.

On a slim connection but seeding this as much of 24/7 as possible out to at least x1000. That's x940.5 to go."
,taxcut,2008-10-29T15:39Z,Good job!
,Homebrew52,2009-01-29T13:31Z,"Terrific movie.  Certainly leaves a lasting impression.  Having acknowledged that, however, I think the long term prognosis is absurdly grim.  Hiroshima and Nagasaki actually rebounded quite rapidly after the war.  Yes, there were horrid long-term medical issues for the survivors.  Yes, today's nukes are much bigger (though smaller, tactical, ones have also made a comeback).  Nonetheless, once you move beyond the ""black circle"" of ground zero, survival becomes quickly more likely.  As for infrastructure, the survivors aren't going to return to Medieval mentalities, as depicted in this film.  They will pick up the pieces, such as they are, and rebuild.  It's what we do.  Incidentally, munkybutt, what country doesn't have ""we are right"" values?  Maybe yours has ""we are wrong"" values?  That sure is a healthy ethic.  "
,johnnatnight,2009-02-13T00:55Z,"LOL Homebrew I so wish that were true. This movie is BEYOND DISTURBING. I grew up in the early 80's and used to have nightmares (more like night terrors) about the war starting. To this day when I hear that emergency broadcast tone on a radio or TV I still hold my breath a little until they say ""this is only a test"". The really scarey part is that even the horror of this film is still probably much less severe than what it would actually be like. We still have missles pointed at russia, china, etc and mistakes can still happen. Everyone involved in the decision to use nuclear weapons should be required to sit through this movie."
,Kojak00,2009-06-15T17:40Z,"I'm quite bad at seeding tbh, but this one will be up for download as long as my HD works (and its a relatively new one).

This is a severe case of not only watching, seeding and leeching, but spread the word about it as well! Download it, seed it, burn it, give it away as presents, send it by email, anything. This film is so important I think everyone should see it at least once."

,GaianOrlanthii,2011-04-03T01:06Z,"Hey Homebrew, I'm guessing that you're a lot younger than anyone who saw this movie when it came out so I'll help you out here:

The BBC already made a movie about a nuclear attack on Britain that was immediately banned by the British govt. because it was so realistic. Too realistic for them, in other words. 
The movie was called 'The War Game (1965)'.

Although American made films like 'The Day After (1983)', they were derided in Europe for being soft on the effects of what a nuclear war would actually be like to survive through. 
Here's a clue: Not Easy.

These days, noone seems to understand the horror that a nuclear exchange would cause anywhere on the planet. Computer games like 'Call Of Duty' and TV shows like '24' make like a nuclear explosion is just a minor disaster that any action hero can deal with it in the course of a day. Like just some kind of big bomb, somewhere in the distance.


If you have problems dealing with the sight of an airliner plunging into an office-block, or muslim children being burned alive by Predator missiles, or a young girl running screaming 
towards soldiers while her skin is on fire, then you I think you ought to watch 'Threads'. 

That way you can at least be reassured that noone is lying to you about the effects of modern warfare.

 Really. No joke."

,jlukens,2012-01-04T06:21Z,"@Osaka: Put the tin-foil hat away.  There isn't some vast world-government conspiracy to bring about forced-eugenics/genocide.  You're a twat, and so is anyone who pays you an ounce of mind.

@GaianOrlanthii: That's quite a high-horse you call down from.  Threads was just as ""soft"" as The Day After (both effective, powerful movies).  True, we Americans tend to try and develop characters (usually to failure) in disaster-scenario movies, at least The Day After more accurately displayed the acute effects of fallout radiation (Threads = 30 days+ after attack and full head of hair and few blisters...brilliant!).  At least The Day After included the disclaimer that their scenario would pale in comparison to a full-scale conflict.  Did Threads?  Nope.  I like both movies, by the way.  But yours was a Pilkington response which needed rebuttal. "
,jlukens,2012-01-04T06:31Z,"Once more thing, Karl Pilkington (aka, 
GaianOrlanthii): You're not in some kind of ""elite club."" Most grown adults know of the futility of an all-out nuclear exchange.  At least they do where I live.  Maybe not in your estate.  Muslim children burned alive by Predator missiles is terrible.  So are British children whose lives are snuffed out in the Tube.  Interesting how you neglected to mention that.  You're a twat, and your head is a big, fuggin round orange."
