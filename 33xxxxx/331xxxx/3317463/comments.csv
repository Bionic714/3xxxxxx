,boosh39,2010-02-21T10:38Z,Is this ripped from the Region 1 edition? TV ripped? Or is it Region 2 ripped: R2 UK & R4 Australia (Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment) - In the episode Dead Soldiers the scene in which Armadillo's face is held against the cooker appears to've been cut by around 8 seconds.
