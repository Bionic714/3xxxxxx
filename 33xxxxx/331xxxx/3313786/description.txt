Timely with the release of the long-overdue Wong Kar Wai movie 2046, its original soundtrack has 20 moody, heart-felt instrumental tracks from the movie starring the biggest Asian star names in the industry including Tony Leung, Faye Wong, Kimura Takuya, Zhang Ziyi, Maggie Cheung and Gong Li. The well composed, arranged and mixed tracks are the works of the highly respected Umebayashi Shigeru (who has secured music credits for his masterpieces in In The Mood For Love, House of the Flying Dagger and Zhou Yu's Train), London Symphony Orchestra and several other stylish musicians.
