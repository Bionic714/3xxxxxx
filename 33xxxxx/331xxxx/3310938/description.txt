It's a high energy workout as gorgeous Grammy-winner Olivia Newton-John performs everything from old favorites to modern funk. In this extra special concert she goes from saunas to seashore. from deserts to dance halls and from down to earth ballads to out of this world rock. In addition, you can count on fabulous costumes, outrageous sets, and Olivia at the top of her form.
