,dannyboy93,2006-11-11T21:25Z,"Exactly, what does it? Is it a utility created so you can make PSP homebrew?"
,chigga102,2006-11-12T23:18Z,this is useless if you dont have the OFFICIAL sdk. i suggest you just read up on using cygwin with the psp toolchain
,jasen1974,2007-11-30T21:18Z,This could be complete. but what i heard it requires a Japanese PSP with firmware 1.0
,keepontruckin65,2009-04-11T04:39Z,Can you use this to develop apps for other OS's like Palm OS. I don't have a PSP but I don't want to pay like $550 just to make Plam Pilot apps.
