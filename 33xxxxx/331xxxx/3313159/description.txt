Fourth album by this Polish band who formed in 1969 (first album 1975) and are still going strong.
Heavy symphonic progressive rock, but rockier than alot of later SBB, excellent musicianship, polish vocals.
This is ripped from vinyl so sorry if quality a bit less than usual.
Track names in notes file.
Enjoy!
