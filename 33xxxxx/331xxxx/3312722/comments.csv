,Sarre,2005-04-08T20:51Z,"""ERROR:
Problem connecting to tracker - (111, 'Connection refused')""

Well, that's ironic. At least TPB works. (It may not work fast, but it works)"
,mezpin,2005-04-08T23:34Z,"Yeah. I know, I know.  Not having the best luck with trackers. But even still, Demonoid has been working more consistently than the TPB tracker.  Personally, I can only connect to TPB once out of every 4-5 times that Azureus tries to refresh.  And other websites have major problems trying to get statistics from the TPB tracker since it's so overloaded.  But Demonoid has been hiccupping, too.  Just trying my best to find a reliable public tracker.  I'm always open to suggestion."
,mezpin,2005-04-09T17:08Z,"It all depends on how I think the swarm is doing.  The fourth part will probably be out sometime this weekend -- maybe even tonight (I'm on East Coast time).  The extras are smaller than the previous torrents (861MB), so I might be able to push them out fairly soon after the fourth part, i.e. tomorrow or Monday.  If I don't use the TPB tracker, I'll post the links in the comments again."

,Brilwen,2009-08-28T07:25Z,We would enjoy the final season but no one apparently seeds this looks like a dead torrent...
,notenough,2009-09-18T18:41Z,"For anyone looking for the complete series, it's here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3351072/Angel_complete_seasons_1_through_5

And no, I'm not the poster of that torrent. I'm just pointing it out since it doesn't seem to show up on a piratebay search."
