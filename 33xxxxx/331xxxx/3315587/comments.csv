,Buffelberra,2005-04-15T17:12Z,Seed PLZ! Is this good?
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-16T23:42Z,"No, they are horrible, like everything else I encode.  That's why I uploaded it.  To waste everyone's bandwidth with poorly encoded, C rate movies that are so bad, that you can't even watch 5 minutes of them without becoming explosively violent, and running umuck with a meat-cleaver."
,NalleGnupp,2005-05-26T15:35Z,"Please, some seed...
At the moment we are 15 people who all are stuck at 99,5%
I really love the first movie (I even bought it on VHS) and would like to get it in better quality.
We are only missing about 7 megabytes until we can enjoy these movies.
So please..."
[T],sickboy88,2005-05-27T09:51Z,"I don't have them anymore.  I put the word out.  Try asking in the forum, although no one answered me there about anything before. :("
,NalleGnupp,2005-05-28T00:23Z,"OK, thank you anyway.
We will just have to hope that someone appears with the missing parts one day (that's what happened when we went from 99% to 99,5% a couple of days ago)"
,Raistlin (DK),2005-07-04T12:36Z,please seed again
[T],sickboy88,2005-08-02T11:25Z,"No, no one ever will, because 99% of people on here have a dick in their mouth..."
,Cranefly,2006-01-15T17:41Z,"Seed, please. We're all stuck at  97.5% :("
,champagne_superapa,2006-01-23T23:07Z,seed plx
,xxxRavenxxx,2006-03-16T05:25Z,I'd be really happy if someone could seed this. 97.5% done right now.
,gusar,2006-05-31T04:04Z,"Oh c'mon, even 3 months from the previous post situation hasn't changed! Anyone, seed please! But we're determined leechers. Maybe one day a messiah will come..."
,Talumait666,2006-06-27T17:14Z,"Please seed ! There are still about 20 ppl waiting for that 2,5 % to download so its worth seeding for!"
,d1962a,2006-08-13T07:38Z,Been stuck at 97.5 for about 2 months now...
,AssFaster,2006-09-03T16:55Z,Please seed. stuck at 97.5. will seed after downlaoded complete...
,buffr0vrflw,2006-10-13T02:12Z,Also stuck at 97.6%.. now if just someone could seed the final 2.4% 
,Nemetroid,2006-10-28T15:20Z,"I gan't get 100% either, but VLC media player can play it anyway. When sections are missing the picture freezes, but from my experience always less than 10 secs. MPC and mplayer probably can open it aswell.

Dunno how well a standalone dvd player would handle it."
,Cargonnas,2006-12-05T01:06Z,"Nice mate, have been looking for this movie ( part 1 ) for a long time.... very nostalgic.
Did'nt know there was a sequal... cool thumbs up

Can somebody please seed ?"
,Cargonnas,2006-12-06T16:33Z,"Nice 
Troll part 1: Is still one of the cool'er 80's adventure / "" horror ""- tales I know, it has got a wonderful feel to the special-effects and mood of the film which creates a great movie-illusion and draws you into the movie... I remember seeing this movie repeatedly when I was young.

Troll Part 2: this is a BAD movie, It has no real ties to the first one, the acting is bad and the mood of the entire film is low-buget, I was kindda hoping to see a great adventure film but this is just bad
one thing tho there are some effects in it, that's okay but nothing memorable. "
,bwtosca,2007-04-21T17:16Z,"Theese are really great films!
Someone please seed som i can get them.
And with love to you all...
Stop deleting your seeds for fuck sake."

,farlight,2007-07-09T18:43Z,Please seed 97.6% -.^

,oxxo.,2007-09-01T13:32Z,why has every one stopped seeding? im stuck on 97.7% and now no one wants to share.
,oxxo.,2007-09-01T15:14Z,"has anyone actually downloaded this film yet? everybody seems to be stuck at 97.7%, and also whats the quality like?"
,farlight,2007-09-06T21:35Z,"The movies are very much watchable (even if ""troll 2"" suck left donkey ball) and the 3% that we didn't get is just a minor glitch in the middle somewhere (in the firstone anyway) nothing really noticeable.

And yes, 505 people HAS dl these movies but none is shareing it and has probably deleted the torrent long ago and that anyone of them actually read these comments and decideds to dl the torrent and letus get the last 3% is like...000000000000.1% chance!

So... I'll share my 97% of it..forever? Or until i find the movie elsewhere, haven't actually looked... yet."
,teniz,2007-09-22T23:21Z,"*BUMP*
Any chance of a seed? Or perhaps a message
to the creator (sickboy88)?"
,mdogg,2007-10-23T05:01Z,"lol this saga has been goining on for over 2 years now. nobody will ever seed this. -_-"""
