I'll tell ya, I've rarely laughed as much as in the week following Nov. 2 last year. Watching the despair of you liberal crybabies wreaked serious havoc on my stomach muscles!

Put up a video of the inauguration speech instead, it was truly one for the ages.

God bless America."
,pubbie,2005-04-02T17:04Z,phahaha one for the ages! good one..
,Ponde,2005-04-02T17:16Z,God bless America for still having people like Mabusfoo
,u002,2005-04-02T17:27Z,Every empire falls Renaldo.  I enjoy watching yours beginning to crumble.  Aren't you people supposed to be afraid of hell?
,mrbearpimp,2005-04-02T18:26Z,You're welcome to seed this :)
,Renaldo,2005-04-02T21:06Z,"A God-fearin' man ain't afraid of the devil. I reckon you shold be though, u002. If you live life like there ain't no God, well, you'd better be right, if you know what I'm sayin'."

,mabusfoo,2005-04-03T22:51Z,"This footage is raw footage from my camera so there's a lot of crap in there. I don't have the time to cut it up. Also it isn't compressed so for you video people out there feel free to use any clips you want. As for the comments, I think someone forgot to tell that one guy that god died years ago from a self inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Unfortunately he didn't leave a will so the government auctioned off the estate. There wasn't much though. Just an old delapidated barn, two 2x4s nailed together, a mardi-gras necklace, and some dusty copies of a strange fiction novel. Sorry to break the news to you this way buddy but it's best that someone told you before you spent your life ranting and raving about your immaginary friend."

And what about the tear gas? For what reason did they spray it in the face of the man holding his cell phone? This is to me, as a Swede or any other adherent of social justice and real non-representative democracy, extremely curious how you, the non-privileged people of America, can allow this to go on. It is time for you to tear down the Federal System alongside the warmonger hard-core religious conservatives and narrow-minded (not necessarily two different groups) and build something better and decentralized. These pictures are reminiscent of the German Democratic Republic's police state actions against demonstrators for freedom of the press, and now you can't even express your discontent in front of Bush. Best of luck, cause you will need it to bring down the Establishment!"
