Many apologies for the jip track in original seed.
As for naming tracks, when an album has too many tracks I don't bother cuz, hey I have a life beyond uploading and downloading and it just takes too long. I do always include trackslists in the notes file - READ it:) If I do have the time I will certainly name files as well.
Thnx for all votes and comments, all appreciated!
