Either the video plays way too fast (the audio is perfect, though!) or it plays ""jumpy"". I never had any trouble with other downloads but maybe I am missing a codec? Thanks for your info! ;-)"
,pudeldroska,2005-04-11T22:09Z,I used XviD MPEG-4 codec. It works fine with VLC player too (www.videolan.org); it's got all codecs integrated.
