,stevepick,2005-04-13T18:27Z,"I assume that there is a difference between this build and IportalX ?

THis build is from nov 04 is probably build 33 !?"
,eXcavator,2005-04-13T18:50Z,"This build is dated 06 december..

If I'm not wrong, IPortalX is the limited free version of Invision Portal made to compete with SOOP Portal"
,stevepick,2005-04-13T20:43Z,Thanks 
,eXcavator,2005-04-13T20:47Z,"no problem..

I will try to release the updates as soon as they are out..

Drew's gon kill me :)"
,eXcavator,2005-04-14T22:32Z,"I'm sorry, I have to correct myself.
iPortalX is NOT the free version, it is the new real version, but it is currently ALPHA or BETA or whatever this fool have decided to call it..
