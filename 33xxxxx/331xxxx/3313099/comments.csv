cu hauke  "
,tinywiz,2005-06-03T11:04Z,"Tried installing again on a fresh PPC.
All works fine.

Could you specifiy where it ask for registration ???

1. Install application - all options
2. When it asks if you like to install to PPC - choose Yes
3. When it asks for reginfo, enter anything - DON'T GO TO WEBSITE
4. Copy the countries you like from the installation to whatever memorycard you have
5. Start Alturion from PPC and choose the location of the county.ppm file
6. Use the program....

No activation needed, no serial asked !!! Thats it..."
,tinywiz,2005-06-03T11:07Z,"@Golab

Programet är nerladdat 2078 ggr.... Det är 2 eller 3 som har klagat på att den vill ha reginfo....

Dra din egen slutsats..."

,skipperdy,2005-07-28T14:40Z,"Is it possible to run this on a laptop/tabletPC without a PPC? The installer complains and quits, but on the site they say: ""Alturion? GPS Professional 6.0 is a professional GPS navigation solution for PDA and laptop."""

Anyone got the Laptop version?"

,The Morbyn,2006-04-09T16:25Z,Kan man lägga in programmet och sen de kartor man behöver på en mobil telefon om de får plats på minnet
,olympus1243,2006-07-14T15:41Z,"I think that this is indeed the right version for the laptop... Because it has guiding voices and all that stuff... but indeed it also supports the pocket pc version.. However I to have not been able to get it up and running.... The prog installs just fine, but the registration info is needed, or a crack, but apparently this is nowhere to be found.. so unless you plan on using this software on a ppc where it does work so they say( i don't have a ppc so i can't try it), don't download this file, it's just a waist of time and bandwidth....until someone finds out a away to skip registration or a valid one, wich at present time no one has.. if somebody got it to work on a laptop, please post the solution"
