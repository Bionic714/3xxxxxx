DMT's release of this movie was improperly cropped, resulting 
in anoying borders remaining on the sides. Here is a properly 
cropped release with a higher resolution, high audio bitrate, 
and a lower aspect ratio error"

WE should Boycut this site for a time, if  PB dont make some rules for syncrynized movies..

they could just make a category with that.. and ofcause banned the uploaders if they dont stick to the rules..

i dont mind the sync versions, but only when i downloaded a movie where it didn´t say anything about its a ex. spanish/french what ever sync version..
