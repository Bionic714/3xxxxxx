,parkiet,2005-04-02T11:38Z,I believe it's the new eJay DJ Mixstation
,parkiet,2005-04-02T22:25Z,too bad it's in french...
,HighSlayer,2005-04-07T13:10Z,"Dont bother with this unless you are french or speak it fluently.

When installing, you have the option of which language to use, but whatever you select - it only installs the french version, which seems totally pointless to me!"
