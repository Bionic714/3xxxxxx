,DingoKidney,2006-08-16T10:36Z,"Hey y'all, I downloaded this and when I run it, I get big white blank areas for a lot of icons and descriptions of classes and stuff. It looks like the expansions were with it (it lists blackguard and whatnot as available, but you can never take them) and maybe before turning it into a torrent someone just tried to untangle all the files, left some they shouldn't, and took some they shouldn't... anyone else had this problem? I mean, it runs alright... I just can't see a lot of stuff... most spell icons, for example.."

,parain,2010-06-23T20:09Z,so i have the game dled. the cd keys worked for me. but every time i try to create a new character the game crashes on me. please help
,Sambonimachine,2011-04-09T23:12Z,"OK! I got it to work! Darelas key does work, only at first it only gives the option for multiplayer. If you try to do multiplayer with this key, it will only ban your ip address. So, you type in the crack, and then quit the game. Remove the file nwncdkey.ini (don't delete though) and open game again. It asks for a new one. Don't type anything, just quit. Then put nwncdkey.ini back again and open game. It should work, at least it did for me. :)"
