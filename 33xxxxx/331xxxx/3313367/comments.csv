,fluffybal,2005-04-08T21:07Z,how the fu*k do you open these files?
,fluffybal,2005-04-08T21:51Z,Do you need a DC emulator?
,dj321,2005-04-09T14:50Z,"Download latest Winrar & Alcohol 120%.
Unrar the files and burn them with Alcohol.

You need a Dreamcast and Shenmu 01 to play the game."
,fluffybal,2005-04-09T16:11Z,"So its not you're not able to play it on the PC :'(.
Since i don't have a dreamcast."
,mufflon,2005-04-10T15:23Z,"I will seed at least until 2.0

And, btw, you're welcome to rate my torrents as well... (PSO Online Kit)"
,tmnt05,2005-05-28T19:07Z,"You can play shenmue2 on PC with chankast -emulator. For me it works, tho a bit slow, and the sound is buggy. But it's still playable

,coolaidman,2005-07-05T05:12Z,does this work on a u.s dreamcast? i haev shenmue 1 and a dreamcast and have been wanting to play this so does it work on a u.s ntsc dreamcast anything special to do with it?
,coolaidman,2005-07-05T05:12Z,by the way those look like shenmue 1 screens
,wrxricer,2005-07-24T10:36Z,Hey dj321 this game doesnt work!!! what gives?? I tryed to load it and it says no game is in. I even tryed a boot disk with it and still no luck. Burned with a Microadvantage DVD +/- DL burner and alcohol 120.. did I do something wrong???
,wrxricer,2005-07-27T09:18Z,Hm.... I guess this game doesnt work. DONT DL!!! you'll just be wasting 4 cd-r's and your time DLing it.
,wrxricer,2005-08-01T12:53Z,lmao. Do I feel like a jackass. Never mind my other posts. It works. Just had wrong settings. A note to people using alcohol 120 to burn this. You need overburn on to make this game work. (its under options -> recording -> Enable overburn. Also it needs to be on RAW DOA to work. Sorry for the misunderstanding dj321..
,theshiverman,2006-01-16T21:02Z,How do i burn the Second disk in this set? is there some special way i need to unpack it or something?
,fredden,2006-02-27T21:25Z,Hur ska man kunna använda Cd 2??????????????????????????????????????????
,Pr0ph3t4,2006-03-14T23:02Z,"Are the dialogs in english? Cause i need Shenmue 2 with dialogs in japanese, since my shenmue 1 is in japanese, my save game file wont load on an english shenmue 2 =( Just for the record, i know that for a fact cause i got shenmue 2 in english and it doesnt work at all, maybe someone knows of a patch to solve this?"
,Wylder,2006-09-07T09:25Z,Jag undrar som några andra vad jag ska göra med cd 2.
,jessman1988,2006-10-31T07:51Z,"Who, may I ask, ripped this version of Shenmue 2?  I have the echelon rip and it's missing much of the japanese speech."
,gwannin,2006-11-24T13:41Z,"Disc 2 is fine and can be extracted from its many files back in to one file by selecting any of the files (although it's logical to start with the first one) right clicking, and winrar-ing it.  Presto, all the files become one.  

The game is lacking lots of speech and soundtracks because the original games were extracted from GD-ROM, a format that is unrecognized by PC's and is somewhere between a CD and DVD in terms of data storage capacity.  At present DC emulation does not support DVD's, so large amounts of the game detail had to be cut in order for the game to fit to disc.  As audio runs in a time line and in this format can't be used any other way (i.e. data, to be read by a p.c.) this was the logical detail that had to go.  Considering this, this is a very good conversion.  

As one file in each of the discs is named 'echelon' it seems pretty obvious who made this.  Much respect team echelon.

Maybe this information will solve the appalling seeder-leecher ratio that has currently befallen this torrent.  After i'm through, its down to you to keep this excellent game alive.

Big love to dj321   "

,Inferno5402,2007-07-24T18:00Z,data read error -30 mpk00.pkf? ITS ON DISC 3 CAN ANYONE HELP ME!!!!
,napaolm,2008-03-27T17:27Z,"hi dj321, just have several questions, hope you dont mind:

1. can the contents of these be burned to a regular CD?  I ask this because Dreamcast uses GD-ROM doesn't it? Im just not sure if GD and CD is just the same.

2. can i use any other CD burning program like Nero for this?  Or do I really have to use Alcohol or the other programs mentioned by these other people?

3. Will this work with US and NTSC versions of DC?  What's your DC version?

4. Is this copy of shenmue 2 in english or japanese?  

5. was it ripped from xbox or DC?

6. do you have any other advice?

hope these aren't much for you, btw, thanks for sharing :D"
,BuckyRulez,2008-06-10T01:49Z,"i wouldn't mind knowing too. i do plan on buying shenmue 2, but also do i play this on pc, or burn it to a cd and play on DC?  i am very new to this whole area of things"
,leo620,2008-07-31T12:32Z,"Guess what? It's in Spanish. Cool, you know, but the uploader could have warned us."
,JPeterson,2009-03-14T01:19Z,"I'm wondering the same thing as napaolm.

1. Is anything ripped?
2. Is it the japanese speech or english speech version?

If it's the Echelon release from November 25th, 2001 then it has Japanese speech, but a lot of it has been ripped. All non-cut scene speech as I understand it."
,JPeterson,2009-03-14T05:37Z,"I'm looking for the full GD-ROM size version of this game, with the (unofficial) english speech modification."
,JPeterson,2009-03-14T06:04Z,"I found the unripped version here http://www.mininov_.org/tor/2336590, it uses the PirateBay tracker, but the torrent doesn't seem to be listed on this site, and it has no seeders. Also it's the original japanese version, it's not the english version. However according to this post http://dumpcast.thekickback.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=355 the entire game may not have been converted to english, possibly only the first disc, and possibly only cut scenes."
