<b>Comments:</b><i>
This drama is mainly a comedy but there are some very touching parts as well. Sorimachi is superb as the unconventional teacher with his own style of solving problems. The way he gradually gains the trust of the students is comical..yet touching as well. I believe after watching this show, all of us would wish we had/once had a teacher like GTO ! : )
Highly recommended! 10/10

I don't want to dissapoint everyone with this review, but....10 stars is not enough to describe how marvelous this drama is. Sorimachi gives his best, yet, in this drama. And Onizuka sensei is a teacher I wanna have, and I wanna be (someday :P). It was funny, hillarious, etc, etc. Watch it and you'll know what I mean.
LET MAKES SCHOOL FUN!! 10/10

I am new to Japanese and just started watching dramas. I saw this drama because my friend recommended it and all the reviews I could find on the web said it was good. So I saw it and WOW...this drama is great. Very touching and I love the character of Onizuka. The way he helps all the students are great...I especially loved the way he helped the last student(very touching)! Watch it, buy it...it wont disappoint. 10/10

Outrageous humour, unbelievable plot, superb acting + touching moments considering the comedy that it is... I think this show sums up why jdramas are so unique and great. If anyone wanted to start watching jdramas i would recommend them to watch its first. Thats how good it is. So if you havent watched it yet, watch it!!
Must be the best or one of the best shows i've see! 10/10

One of the first JDramas I've ever watched. It contained all of the right elements to make this one of the best dramas ever. The music, the story, the acting, and the chemistry between the people, are all superb. This is one drama that will make you laugh, will touch you, will enlighten you, and delight you all at the same time. I personally feel the key ingredient to the success of this drama is that Onizuka is played so well, his character on screen is brought out so much one can't help but connect with him and all the people around him. A must see!! 10/10
