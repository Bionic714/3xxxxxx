Toast 6 allows the user to mount a disk image (.iso /.toast) on the desktop as if a cd is in the drive. All application then think a real cd was inserted.

ToastMount uses some parts of Toast to do all this with a simple drag-n-drop (or double-click) instead of launching Toast, select the Menu and choose the image.

Note: This is NOT the same thing that Disk Image Helper does!

Product Requirements:
Mac OS X 10.3 or higher
Roxio Toast 6
