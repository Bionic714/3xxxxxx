,Kikujiro,2005-04-14T00:22Z,"Alright, enough leeching people.  Let's get some seeders in here."
,vso4152,2005-04-15T03:19Z,"great movie asian cinema :) thanks a lot

,watwegsw,2005-04-15T15:34Z,"ong bak is the best action movie of all time, its just action, story doesnt matter.

And this flick is really bad, thanks for sharing though"
,bebop2000,2005-04-19T19:54Z,"Anyone else having trouble connecting to this one? I'm just getting ""unknownhostexception"" errors."
,forgotten_qt,2005-06-24T13:41Z,"Good action movie. It's got explosives, guns, hand-to-hand combat, and a crippled guy beating the shit out of someone."
,DARKNESS69247,2005-07-19T06:58Z,"can we get some more seeders? And all I think anyone cares about is if the action is good, so can some one tell us if it is?"
