Undercover cop Deaw (Dan Chupong) and his partner has been trying to capture Thailand's biggest arms smuggler General Yang (Noppol Gomarachun) for the past five years. Their final attempt proves fruitful as General Yang is captured, but his partner dies in the ensuing battle. Taking a vacation after the chaotic event, Deaw is convinced by his little sister to take a trip to a rural village where she and their old classmates will pass out food and supplies to the villagers. But his vacation soon comes to a halt when the village is captured and held hostage by General Yang's men, who threatens to launch a nuke every hour he is not freed! After slaughtering half the villagers and rounding up the rest, General Yang's men make an ultimatum to the Prime Minister - either release Yang, or the rest of the villagers will die.
