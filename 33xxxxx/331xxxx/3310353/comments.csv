For sure your English is academic  
And for if you realize the big ones   
you program they come and several languages  
among them Spanish.  
but sure not the one that your languages?"
,eldata,2005-04-02T18:49Z,"I think that this place is to share.    
and without differences of languages.    
each one discharges their necessities    
but without lacks of respect to users    
that they offer something without own interests.    
some write negative comments     
great percentage of these,     
alone they discharge without contributing    
anything. "

mas o menos en espaĂąol: falta algo en el fin de la pelicula, termina antes que los credits empiezan, entonces no sĂŠ cuanto falta."
