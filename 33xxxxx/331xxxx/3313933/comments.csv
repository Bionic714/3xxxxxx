PC Check is supposed to run off a floppy disk, due to some of its tests needing to write back to the media.  

If you load the CD into UltraISO, extract the boot image and load that into winimage, you will find the floppy disk is actually on the CD twice.

Use Winimage to write the bootimage to a floppy disk.  I shall upload a working floppy disk image later on."
