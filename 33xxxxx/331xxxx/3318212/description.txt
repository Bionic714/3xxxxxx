I finally figured out why I got errors when I run the bonus disk. It tries to update my dashboard Live-ways.

Anyway this is the bonus munk with his special martial art style. If you don't want the whole disk which contains crappy "the making of" videos and game demos then this is enough. And it doesn't update your dash.

Instructions:

1. Make sure you have run the game once. So you have a save file for it. Eather change some options or have a game saved.

2. Extract this rar file to its own folder, Jademonk should be good.

3. FTP that folder to your xbox in apps or games or what ever.

4. Run it.

5. You should figure out the rest.
