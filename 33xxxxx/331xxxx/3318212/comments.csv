,Frezzno,2005-04-17T20:49Z,I also need to express that I got this file from another place. Who ever did this one is a great and helpful guy.
,Frezzno,2005-04-17T22:09Z,"LE bonus disk has 2Gb of data but you only need 16 Mb to get your monk. Not even that, 200kb is all that unlocks the monk."
,n20,2005-04-18T04:30Z,can this be burned or something for the people without the ftp
,teppy,2005-04-18T07:11Z,"Can someone help me? I u/l the jademonk folder to my apps folder... i have a jade gamesave.... but when i run the jademonk program, it says ""Error! No definition file (b:cdxmediacdx_7.inx). What should I do? I'm running the jade off a burned dvd - the game runs fine - is that a problem?"
,Frezzno,2005-04-18T08:46Z,"Then you faild to tranfer the files properly because some files are missing.

This rar contains two folder and a xbe file. These files needs to be in its own folder on the Xbox.

If you can't FTP it to the xbox then burn these files directly to the root of a CD-RW. Then it can be executed just like an ordinary game disc."
,n20,2005-04-18T09:34Z,i did burn these files directly onto a cd (burned as data disc) when i start my xbox with the cd in it tho it just goes to the dash doesnt say or do anything
,Frezzno,2005-04-18T09:39Z,"n20, now go to my files on XBMC and run default.xbe from the cd. I don't know if this works but give it a shot."
,teppy,2005-04-18T15:22Z,"No, all of the files ARE extracted properly. I've done stuff like this all the time. I SFV checked the RAR and it was all in-tact.  There is no cdx_7.inx in the RAR. I will give the CDRW a try."
,Frezzno,2005-04-18T16:01Z,"I'm sorry Teppy but I'm out of ides here and faild to help a brother.

There is no cdx_7.inx file ever, not even on the original disc. So I don't have a clue why it's calling for this file.

Before I'm total beyond point of no helping you try this.

Go to MS dash and delete some save games you never gonna use again. Specially if you have Forza trial and Mach Assault 2 demo save, delete them at once.

Do not use EvolutionX game save manager. My experience is that it only delete from UDATA and not from TDATA.

Good luck."
,n20,2005-04-18T17:29Z,"dam it wont read it from xbmc either..  =( 

did i burn it  correctly as a data disc with everything from the rar as the root (2 folders 1 file) ?"
,n20,2005-04-18T18:33Z,"naw i cant see the files. im using memorex as well.. but its cdr not cdrw.. should i convert it to xiso format or something or dont even bother since its cdr. btw the cd can be read by my computer when i put it back in and i heard thats a bad thing since whatever the pc can read the xbox cant.. 

i dont know man im outta ideas"
,Frezzno,2005-04-18T20:58Z,"Converting to XISO will not make any difference when your x-drive can't recognise the disc. There are two solutions I can think of:

1. Change media brand.

2. Get a crosslink cable and hook your Xbox with your PC. This way you will also get the advantage of Xlink Kai, and use your Xbox to the maximum.

Good luck."
,crynar,2005-04-19T00:20Z,"I was getting the ""Error! No definition file (either b:cdxmediacdx_7.inx or b:cdxmedia"" when I tried to load up the bonus disk as well. I was able to fix it by changing my pbl from nkpatcher to pblmetoo and changing my bios from evox m8 to x2. Then I burned a cd of the monk content and booted it up w/o error.

It should be noted that I was still unable to run the bonus content from my HD."
,Frezzno,2005-04-19T01:21Z,"Finally some expert help, thank you Crynar.

I didn't know that this kind of trouble exists. My xbox is softmodded and every thing works fine. I can even run the bonus disc from my HD. So I really didn't have a clue on how to help.

I hope the rest of you guys can fix it now."
,teppy,2005-04-19T03:26Z,"First off, a thank you to Frezzno for giving me some ideas to think about. I was receiving the same error ""b:cdxmediacdx_7.inx or b:cdxmedia"" that Cynar got... so I thought I'd download the full Jade Empire Bonus DVD and give it a whirl (only took an hour or so to d/l) and sure enough it worked. Who knows why, but others might wanna give it a try if they can't get the 7mb file to work."
,TheDamned,2005-04-19T12:46Z,"Well i havent had any problems with this so it cant be the file it must be the different xbox mods and configs,Anyway one question i got the monk to show up and he plays ok but whrs his new fighting style ? does it show up later? anyhelp thnx."
,Frezzno,2005-04-21T19:40Z,"You need to use this monk as he is, not customized."
,Frezzno,2005-04-21T19:43Z,I think? I have never seen one begin the game with claws and smash peeps to other side of the screen in a blow.
,Dragonite_9,2005-04-22T23:12Z,"Hi
I wounder if you have to burn it out on a cd or if you just could ftp:a it over?
If you ftp:a it over how should you do?
Thank you

DS"
,Frezzno,2005-04-23T07:55Z,"Visserligen har vi redan gått igenom detta, men vi kan ta det igen.

Man kan FTPa eller bränna på cd. CD-RW hälst, så slipper man slösa på CD. Denna fil är bara 16Mb.

FTP:
Extrahere dessa filer till sin egen map. FTPa denna map till xboxen i antigen Apps eller games. Det spelar ingen roll vilken som.

CD:
Bränn dessa filer så att default.xbe hamnar på roten.

Notera, se till att du reda har en sparfil på xboxen."
,Gladiatorxxx,2005-07-30T05:35Z,Rename cdx_4 to cdx_7 fixes it
,Fum3tsu,2005-08-04T17:21Z,"The new martial arts style is there to the best of my knowledge. However i havent played the game since i beat it as Scholar Ling with the Open Palm so i cant quite remember. And you can costumise the monk as much as you want to because if there is a new style then it HAS to be in the menu of usable styles on creation just like you can costumise any other character to use a different ""class?' style."
,p44tt15,2006-04-07T20:28Z,"I know this is old, but would really appreciate it if somebody could seed it!"
,countxero,2006-09-18T15:32Z,Seeding would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you
