In support of Portishead's self-titled second album the band have completed a 10-month world tour. Both the tour and second album were christened with a special live engagement on 24 July, 1997 at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City dubbed "PNYC".

The one-night-only performance was an exclusive reworking of the band's tracks from both "Dummy" and "Portishead" and featured a full orchestra and horn section and filmed in front of an intimate audience.

The Roseland performance marked the first time any of the new songs from Portishead were being performed live and rather than performing on the ballroom stage, Portishead opted for a more informal and, ultimately, more intimate setting. The band and orchestra assembled in the round directly on the ballroom floor surrounded by the audience. Says Utley of the setup, "We wanted to get more people involved in the atmosphere around us. Being in a circle, more people could see what was going on. The musicians could all look at each other and have this intimate thing."
