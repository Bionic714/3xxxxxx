,jmcrespo,2005-07-21T21:23Z,I had problems with this torrent. I was downloading about 2 weeks ago and suddenly it stopped. 2 days with no seeds and no peers. I was wondering if someone else had this issue. Now it seems to be working fine.
,spaceape,2006-04-19T12:54Z,"This is NOT season 2, episode 13-24. All downloading for nuthing, it turned out to be already seen episodes. Sometimes you win, sometimes you looze."
,SeeMuse,2006-05-08T07:22Z,"It's always best to check the info on www.TV.com, regarding episodes. Sometimes they are numbered sequentially, even when spread out over 2 seasons.
Pitty there won't be any season 3"
