Tale of Genji / Genji Monogatari

This animated film, based pretty faithfully on the first one third of the classic novel The Tale of Genji by Lady Murasaki, is a beautiful and haunting representation of eleventh century Heian Japan, a pessimistic and Buddhist era during which the fictional character Genji Hotaru (The Shining Genji) seeks love and meaning. Many have accused it of lacking plot and energy, which may be accurate; however, that is not the point of the film or the twelve hundred page novel, which is highly atmospheric. The film might be slightly confusing for the viewer who has not read The Tale of Genji, but I don't believe that only those who have read the novel or researched Heian Japan will enjoy it. It is a quietly sad and beautiful story which gives the viewer visual insight into the peculiar lifestyle of the Heian Japanese individual, and he can experience the curiosities of polygamy, spirit posession, Buddhism/Shinto ceremony, and the cult of beauty. The audial aspects of this film are also very alluring; the combination of the unusual tones of the traditional Japanese instruments and the sounds of the characters' environment (swishing silk kimono, dripping oil lamps, the brushing of hair) is incredibly sensuous. True, it is very unhurried and focuses on details that many animated films would neglect; and not everyone would find this interesting. Still, while this film isn't at all an example of the popular sci-fi action anime which draws such a crowd, it is a poignantly gorgeous utilization of the techniques of Japanese animation artists which illustrates a few preciously mysterious and aesthetically moving moments during the golden era of Japan.
