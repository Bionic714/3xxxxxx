,kärlek,2005-04-18T17:37Z,"I don't mean to complain, but I felt I had to correct you on one point here, regarding the first movie and fullscreen vs widescreen. Fullscreen is actually the original aspect ratio, the widescreen version is made by cutting away the top and bottom parts of the image. Usually it is the other way around, but not this time.
To confirm this I downloaded your version, and compared it to my own DVD. Take a look at this image, showing the exact same scene, my version to the left, your to the right:
http://img88.echo.cx/img88/3249/fsvsws8un.jpg
Note the hands. I can give you more examples if you want, but I think it is pretty obvious from this image alone.
I really appreciate your effort, but please change the description to not spread incorrect information about the different versions available."
,kärlek,2005-04-18T17:38Z,"Allright, clicking the link above (in my comment) won't work, you have to copy and paste it into another window."
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-18T22:35Z,"Rasulmin,

I really appreciate your seeding efforts! Good man!  Thank you."
,kärlek,2005-04-19T06:19Z,"I tried to be polite, but hell, what a waste of time. You are suggesting I photoshopped the image just to start an argument? Hooray..."
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-21T11:49Z,"For anyone interested, let's check out the quality and differences in resolution and sound of the last film, ARMY OF DARKNESS.

http://207.136.67.23/film/dvdcompare/army.htm

Yeah...guess I wasn't making shit up after all.

Look at the radical differences between these THREE VERSIONS of the DVD."
,seehowyouare,2005-06-09T02:17Z,"Nice one sickboy88 ...

About the leeching  - you need to block Unknown, Shazeara & Bit Comet 0.56 client IDs if you wanna slow the super leechers down. This blocking occurs at client level, not tracker level."
,Mr Underhill,2006-04-04T20:40Z,Sickboy I just noticed your comment and I believe that is just what I will do....

,plinny,2007-09-16T01:50Z,cant get data from tracker? what the hell is all that about then? i soooooooooo want these films. someone please help!!!!!
,Sicrea,2007-11-19T23:54Z,"Great movies just a word of advice for those wanting to play the trilogy on stand alone DVDs.

""Audio: English, 128 VBR Stereo @ 48K Hz""

means the 90% of todays hardware will suffer from audio slips (if played at all).Therefore be ready to  Google your way to audio renormalization. My personal choice is VirtualDubMod but there is lots of good tutorials for other tools.

Just invest the time and effort to doit, is worthy. "
,Skinupman,2008-03-31T21:34Z,Nice one Sickboy88. Thanks.

[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2009-02-12T11:06Z,"MOST PPL OWN FULL SCREEN, so wide screen sux!!!! ur a retard for calling fullscreen bullshit, idiot....."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2009-02-12T11:08Z,"oh and if ppl are going to watch these on their pc, dont u think FULLSCREENS more suitable? LOFL i hope u feel smart....."
,dethbydeception,2009-02-19T07:01Z,"FuCtUpPuNk, you're retarded and know nothing about fullscreen vs widescreen.  Fullscreen versions are edited to fit the entire screen and therefore the edges of the film on the right and left sides are cut off. You get to see the full film in widescreen."
,msomers,2009-05-14T03:43Z,"WTF are with these retards saying fullscreen is better....

I mean really, I'm at a loss for words.

I bet they are complaining because they paid for a monitor/TV and now watching this 'widescreen bullshit' they have black bars across the screen....for gods sack...buy a new fucking monitor/tv or enjoy the FULL movie and it not being hacked off for 4:3 viewing...idiots "
,S.A.W,2009-05-16T19:03Z,is evil dead one in this download the uncut version?
,Memorexem,2009-06-05T12:40Z,"If it's not, Sickboy ain't doin' his job right! ;)

I Appreciate all the hard work you put into your releases, and I -always- have my tissues ready when I see your name!"

,swallagoon,2012-01-28T15:43Z,"Sickboy88, are you stupid or what?? 

It was FILMED in FULLSCREEN (4:3).

Widescreen cuts off more of the film because the original film negatives were all 16mm film (4:3). Jesus christ.

This is a case when the original film was actually fullscreen not widescreen."
,gkasania1989,2012-02-29T05:48Z,is this torrent still available ???? plz provide me this torrent
