Holy shit! It's the whole fucking EVIL DEAD series, all presented in STEREO and WIDESCREEN.  No fullscreen bullshit here, hell, you miss half of the movie with fullscreen, especially in this series, and even more so with the first movie.

If you haven't seen these, you've really been missing out.  Now you can have the whole series, all encoded in XviD 1.1.0 Beta 2, all in STEREO, all in WIDESCREEN, and all at a bitrate over 1000kbps.

In order, the series goes:

1.  The Evil Dead
2.  Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn
3.  Army Of Darkness

Read on for individual movie details.

NOTICE:

There is a NEW version of XviD 1.1.0 out.  If you have XviD 1.1.0, you most likely have BETA 1.  You need to download and install BETA 2.  The link is at the bottom of the page.

I am sorry I could not include a roll of toilet paper with this release, because I KNOW you'll be masterbating over the quality and delight that only a sickboy88 encoding job can bring you.

If you are going to watch this, you'll want to install the NEW XviD codec:

Now at Beta 2!

http://www.koepi.org/XviD-1.1.0-Beta2-04042005.exe

For top quality, make sure you use the XviD decoder configerator, and turn
on (Y) and (UV) deblocking, and the new feature of
XviD 1.1.0 (Y) and (UV) DERINGING.

If you have a slow computer, please turn off pre-processing. I don't want
another stupid motherfucker telling me that my movies are out of sync
because they are totally computer illiterate.
