"

,CarolusRex,2005-04-08T15:51Z,"Of course its the English version, if it would  have been swedish or anyother language then english it would have said so in the title....."
,Alienangel,2005-04-08T16:20Z,"The crack on this one does not work.
After 30days it's usless, sad but true...
Wait for the corporate edition instead of this crack bs!"
,SweThule,2005-04-08T17:31Z,The crack works fine after 30 days too. 
,John1980,2005-04-08T20:31Z,"The .nfo file says nothing about a key. This one wants me to enter one. The release should probably be nuked only for the fact that it does NOT work as-is.

I'm getting sick of redownloading fixes and releases of this OS. Those warez people can't get it right... "
,SweThule,2005-04-08T20:51Z,"Hmm is there yet ANOTHER version out of this ?

Microsoft.Windows.XP.Professional.x64.Edition.NFO.FIX.PROPER.REPACK-EcHoS"
,krim,2005-04-08T21:23Z,Anyone got a key????
,boyscript,2005-04-08T23:32Z,"yeah i need a key. i got it to boot from cd(nero's fault,just used alchohol and it worked finr) but now i need a cd key. i tryed B2RBK-7KPT9-4JP6X-QQFWM-PJD6G but it dosn't work for me."
,Pyr0,2005-04-09T08:51Z,"the crack doesn't work.
even tho it sez windows is already activated, the activation timer keeps counting down!
if you check the event viewer you get warning  error 1005
Your Windows product has not been activated with Microsoft yet. Please use the Product Activation Wizard within XX days.
if any1 finds a workaround or a working crack, could they please let every1 else know.

also has anybody noticed that the maximum ammount of outgoing connections has been limited to 10 again, i can't find any working patches for this either, the LvlLord one just sez it can't access the tcpip.sys file"
,boyscript,2005-04-09T14:31Z,pr0y what cd key did u use? i found acouple at andr.net and not a single one of them worked.anyone else haveing this problem? or anyone know of a good key gen for this?
,SweThule,2005-04-09T17:45Z,For people looking for the serial try this. Open the AMD64 folder and then scroll down to the unattend text document. At the bottom of the document you'll find what your looking for. 
,boyscript,2005-04-10T01:48Z,"i don't know mabey i'm stupid but i have done exact;y as you said and have not founf the ""unattended"" text doc. i opebed up the amd64 and all i see are stup text documents."
,Deleder2k,2005-04-12T18:55Z,Microsoft.Windows.XP.Professional.x64.Edition.NFO.FIX.PROPER.REPACK-EcHoS noen som kan skaffe den?
,darkthunder,2005-04-13T05:21Z,"Anyone got a working crack for this? The version that I got from the proper repack version from Echos had a crack, but windows is still telling me I need to activate."
,quader,2005-04-13T08:33Z,"Then you are doing it wrong, read and follow the textfile in the crackdir and it should work just fine..."
,darkthunder,2005-04-13T18:07Z,"I did exactly as the readme told me.

1. Install windows
2. Boot into safemode
3. Run the crack (a box appears telling me i cant activate in safe mode)
4. Press OK
5. Now activated, please reboot

Thats exactly how i did it. And it doesnt work!!!"
,quader,2005-04-14T07:44Z,"Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition PROPER REPACK - EcHoS"" , if you have installed this version and done everything according to the textfile .. then VOILA it works, if not your doing it wrong.. Or have the wrong release :)"
,darkthunder,2005-04-14T08:52Z,"I HAVE the correct release, and I have done EXACTLY as the readme says. I'm not lying... the crack doesnt work. 

Someone release a version with a WORKING crack instead, or one that is pre-activated before getting to the desktop the first time."
,Kakel,2005-05-06T18:19Z,"Det funkar hur bra som helst,är ett flertal som laddat ner installerat och lirar med denna version.

,Floggin,2008-08-10T10:39Z,"Don't you love it when your reading forums and comments in torrent trackers on software that is being illegally obtained.  For example, a few in this thread started bashing the wares guys who do the cracking.  They suggested that they got there shit right.   Well to those fucking idiots who are bitching about the crackers who do this to help others, if you don't like the work, GO FUCKING BUY THE SHIT.  This way the ones who may or may not demo the software to ensure we want it don't have change as much when a load is dropped because of your ignorance!!!!!!  

good work Crackers, Tested the timer by advancing my clock in both bios and windows.  It's all good.  I am creating a unattended setup with my shits drivers only and apps.   GOOD WORK!!"
