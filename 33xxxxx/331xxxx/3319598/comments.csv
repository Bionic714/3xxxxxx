Im not seeind the original torrent anymore, but can make a new one really quick."
,RahDaddy,2007-05-21T23:17Z,"Could You possibly seed 'em in seperate bundles? I already got some of these albums, and i don't have uTorrent to uncheck files. Mostly interested in Arlenes Grocery, Live at Olympia, Sony Studios '95, Songs to no one '91, and the unreleased tracks... Oh, and just so that i don't forget. Thanks. Thanks a lot. "
,ikaro,2007-05-23T21:27Z,"ok, ill make it in separate torrents.
keep an eye open for it during today / tomorrow."
,nejeva,2007-06-14T16:18Z,"According to AVG: Jeff_Buckley-Discography\Jeff_Buckley-Mystery_WhiteBoy\Jeff Buckley - Mystery White Boy.jpg ""May be infected by unknown virus Exploit.JPEG"". Anyone else can confirm this or is my antivirus just messing with me?"
,ikaro,2007-09-13T22:44Z,"Your antivirus its nuts.
Don't you think I have better things  to do than play script-kiddie with jpg files?
Come on.

,avatharin,2008-01-01T11:25Z,great collection! Lost everything when my computer crashed.. If you're able to seed I'd love you even more ;) Thanx a million! :D 
,brijamgel,2008-03-10T07:40Z,"Hello, I got to 99%, then started getting: Torrent Error- Access is Denied.  Anyone else having this issue?  This is the only torrent that has ever done this for me.  Thanks to ikaro for the upload, and if anyone is able to seed it would be much appreciated!"
,stelfy,2008-03-19T10:02Z,"thanks for all this ikaro..much appreciated.
but i noticed ""striptease for me baby"" is not there...
i just wanted to know if there is much else out there to try and track down."
,stelfy,2008-03-19T10:18Z,"sorry people.  my mistake...striptease is not a jeff buckley track.

turns out it's a guy hawksley workman or something like that...he's a canadian, singer/songwriter...
i tell you what though, he sounds exactly like jeff on that track...kinda spooky."
,klezmik,2008-04-12T13:14Z,"check this too: http://angry-biscuit.livejournal.com/1035088.html
concerts, in mp3 though, and whole concert tracks. I am not a fan, so I dunno if this is great, nevertheless, check it out!"
,allthegoodnamesaretaken,2008-04-21T02:44Z,thanks 
,elpatina,2008-04-21T13:17Z,"Top marks for torrent download.  And, without intending disrespect to the uploader, absolute bottom marks for leaving the files encoded with yet another (!?!) new file type.  Why do morons do this?  Quit ****ing around and stick with mp3!"
,Valkyre7,2008-06-22T21:10Z,"Thanks to this original uploader, but I've compiled a much neater Jeff Buckley collection with less duplicate files, fixed songs which were broken in this torrent, and higher quality mp3 versions of the 5 most popular CDs...

Enjoy"
,sparklysparks,2008-06-26T05:05Z,"@skapgother: you can download the plug-ins for FLAC and MPC / MP+ for winamp and other players, but I recommend winamp. Just google ""plug in flac winamp"" or something like that, download/install it (very small file) and then you'll be able to play the files. Also, you can use winamp to decode to WAV and then re-code to MP3 if that's the format of your choice. FLAC is loseless audio whilst MPC and MP3 aren't."
,lordquilton,2008-08-01T08:44Z,@ elpatina- go fuck yourself you Nazi.
,Bacon_God,2009-12-10T08:26Z,AVG found 2 .jpg files that were 'threats to my system'

,RareShit,2012-05-12T02:21Z,"I would Have seeded but, i dont Know nething about MPC's and I dont understand why not just rip the shit to mp3.  The whole Reason i was downloading was to put it on my mp3 player.  and it does not recognize that file extension.  So, For me at least, this was a total waste of my time and hard drive space.  Thanks Neways tho.  Im sure they are all good quality and whatnot.  so dont take it like that.  But im just gonna download Grace, and, Sketches, in mp3."
