Anne Rice - The Vampire Chronicles - Book 1 - Interview with the Vampire

Nice vampire classic, here as an audiobook. Guess this one's been ripped from tape since there's pretty high background noise. Not too much to complain about, you still won't have any difficulites to listen to the narrator. It's just a little old school with tape hissing :P Quality is 64 kbps mono @ 44.1 khz by the way. 

It's a rather short audiobook too, only about 3 hours. (Guess the paper version isn't that thick either).

Well, plz help to seed when you're done downloading since my upload is kinda limited. Sharing is caring ppl ;)
