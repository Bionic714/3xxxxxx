,Werm,2005-04-12T18:48Z,"I saw this movie not just 2 weeks ago... Quite a unique film :)

I do recommend that no one read the whole 'review' posted above, though. It accurately describes basically the whole film - including the finale. Skip the 4th and 5th paragraphs if you must read it. Great review, btw. :)

I understand that one should be informed of it's content before viewing, but in my opinion the comments above are too descriptive - read>>>> SPOILERS.

In any case, a movie not soon forgotten. "
,Werm,2005-04-12T18:54Z,Correction: The third and fourth paragraphs above contain the SPOILERS.
,Werm,2005-04-12T19:33Z,"So Pasolini was a pedo, eh? Well, I am very surprised after seeing this film :rolleyes:"
,Bluesoul,2005-04-12T20:22Z,"Some of you have no clue whatsoever about art and filmmaking. Not even considering the comments about Passolini, one of the greatest directors of his time and more...

Get a life, you homophobes"
,orgpunk,2005-04-13T10:03Z,"If you did not know it, homosexuallity and pedophili walks hand in hand. Thats why this guy/gay reacted as he did when you expressed your negative thoughts about pedophiles.

Sal천 is rather an expression of anti-fascist peoples minds and fantasies than an historical dokument. Who practisised what is pictured in the movie? Pasolini and his frends in the anti-fascist movement!"

,dutchmarcus,2006-12-13T15:32Z,"Sorry I can?t help to react, I am aware that the comment area is ideally not used for this kind of debate, but seen these circumstances I could not resist.

You guys have missed the point, cinematography of this caliber isn?t to satisfy your twisted mind, have you taken in to account that perhaps such illustrations are to provoke, initiate debate, document, etc, indeed as Bluesoul stated, clueless when it comes to the art of filmmaking, and probable the meaning of art as a whole. Furthermore are comments such as pedophilia being equivalent to homosexuality or closely associated, are not just insulting to large groups of people, but more so insulting to yourselves as these are completely deprived from any sensibility or reason.

Future advice to you, writing correct English might decoy your lack of intellect."

Important! Law now seeks to illegalize most porn!

There might be a law that prohibits MOST porn! Even adult heterosexual porn!

Please mail this to as many as only possible!
This affects BDSM and bondage, but who knows 
ordinary and heterosexual porn with love and cuddlings involved would be affected?

I HATE child porn, but why illegalizing adult porn?"
