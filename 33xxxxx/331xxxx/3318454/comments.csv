,Toniknak,2007-09-26T21:50Z,Please seed! Once I have 100% I will continue to seed for others. Thanks!

There shouldn't be any clipping unless it was in the original. At that bit rate, it should be practically transparent to CD quality audio.  You're just spoiled by most of these torrents having 320 >_>"
,subtextual,2011-09-27T09:58Z,He means some tracks are skippy as hell and ruin the download.  The CDs were scratched or needed cleaning before they were ripped.  Thanks for the download though.  I'll replace the tracks which skip individually.
