You are a greta guy."
,Sarre,2005-04-10T11:52Z,"Maybe you could rip all the english subtitles (if any, but I assume so) and stuff those in with the extras? That'd be cherry-on-top"
,DrunkJedi,2005-04-10T14:37Z,"Seconded - Anybody seen Part 3 of these?

Either way, good one Mepzin. You rock!"
,mezpin,2005-04-10T16:06Z,"Sorry, but I deleted the project files awhile back and I didn't think to rip the subtitles at the time. The extras will be 7 featurettes and 7 commentaries (as MP3s).  They will probably appear sometime in the next 24 hours, but on the later side of that timeframe.

Just hoping people find their ways to the 3rd part (the link is at the top of the page -- first lines in the description).  I experimented with a different tracker, but it got a lesser audience."
,DrunkJedi,2005-04-11T06:00Z,"Cheers for the link, Sarre. And kudos once again, Mezpin!"
,arijin,2005-04-14T12:32Z,"Dude, where is part 3 ?"

,mezpin,2005-04-15T14:54Z,"Sorry, but I won't be ripping the subtitles.  I've already deleted the project files."
