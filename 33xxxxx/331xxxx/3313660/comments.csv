,Split2ooo,2005-04-08T11:01Z,where did you get this dvd from ?
,diemilkdud,2005-04-08T12:09Z,"Nice -If you have a ""source"" Im looking for the ""darkbackwards""I dont think it made it to dvd I can only find it on vhs,  I have ""dirtyduck"" if anybody is interested,kinda sorta like shame of the jungle."
,pwrmoves,2005-04-08T22:13Z,It's available through Netflix BTW.
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-09T06:56Z,"Netflix has a suprising amount of shit.  I think they have 2 copies of the disk.  Both copies I got from them were so scratched that a 1x rip was not even possible.

Perhaps it was the same copy twice..."
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-09T06:58Z,"The DVD was bought from here:

,Ghlargh,2005-05-06T17:42Z,"You can get it pretty cheap from DVDboxoffice.com too, i don't think it's that rare anymore even if it was rare before.

Sorry if this post turns up twice, it didn't seem to work the first time"
,Mad_Sin,2005-05-21T04:28Z,"Fy fan vad dålig film! ÄLSKAR DEN! Dåliga skådisar, sämmre effekter, smutskastning av både skinhead och punk scenen samtidigt som skaparna hackar på den ""normala"" medborgaren. Helt underbar!"
,RudeBwoy,2005-07-04T21:20Z,thanks sickboy!

[V],Submachine,2006-01-20T10:45Z,"could we get a seed for a lil, my client list says that we are 2 clients stuck at 93,6%. appreciate it :)"
,creatureoftheid,2007-05-30T13:17Z,Yeah... this was uber-rare until about 2002 when it was re-released on DVD. It could be bought at most online DVD (or music) stores. I bought it for $20. The VHS was going for over $50 on eBay at the time. It's less rare than SPICE WORLD. Now DECLINE OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION... I'd like that as a rip.
,Marnaca,2008-06-20T06:51Z,"This movie is beutiful, in a sad kinda way, tragic that decent people should have to live like that, take those rednecks houses and give to them with free power and gas!"
