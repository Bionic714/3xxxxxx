This time I bring you the best Doors bootleg there is, the complete 4-CD set recorded live at the Matrix Club, San Francisco, Tuesday 7th - Friday 10th of March, 1967.

This book/box set comes complete with a 24-page color booklet, as well as four excellent-sounding color picture disc CDs containing every song The Doors performed at San Francisco's Matrix Club on March 7 and 10, 1967. A MUST for any collector!
There are two minor discrepancies in the song lists from those of my low generation tapes of these same shows. The CD notes that Light My Fire was only performed on the 7th. My tapes show this same version performed on the 10th, not the 7th. And the two different versions of The End that were performed on both nights are switched.
Nevertheless, this CD book/box set is the classiest bootleg set I've seen. Don't miss it!

The actual set lists are a bit different than the ones on this release. I included 2 jpg scans (+ the covers in the rar) from Greg Shaw's The Doors on the Road book regarding these gigs. So check that out and compare it to the set lists down below.
