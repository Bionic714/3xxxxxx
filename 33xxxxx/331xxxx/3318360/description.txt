The Wonder Stuff was one of England's musical darlings in the early '90s, and also picked up a solid fan base in the U.S. thanks to college and underground radio support of their albums "The Eight Legged Groove Machine," "Hup" and "Never Loved Elvis."

Unfortunately, their run of good fortune came to an abrupt end as grunge took over the airwaves, and their following release, "Construction for the Modern Idiot," suffocated from lack of U.S. radio airplay.

The band remained cover-story fodder in the U.K., thanks to their outspoken singer, Miles Hunt, and eventually ended on a high note with a triumphant 1994 show at the U.K.'s now defunct Phoenix Festival.

Though the band parted ways, Hunt continued as a musician and wordsmith. He briefly hosted for MTV, released a few solo records and played some well-received solo-acoustic tours of the U.S. with former bandmate Malcolm Treece.

Now, after a few years of successful reunion shows across the pond, Miles and Malc have officially reformed The Wonder Stuff with two new members, bassist Mark McCarthy and drummer Luke Johnson. The U.S. release of the group's fifth album, "Escape from Rubbish Island," is set for March 22. A six-week North American tour--the band's first in more than 10 years--is also planned.
