,heimdall_dk,2005-04-05T11:10Z,"this game is a fake or atleast been tweaked to not work... dosent work with daemon, alcohol 120%, cant be burned with nero or alcohol 120% and that really limits the options for playing the game, reason for this is that the cue file is damaged/fake"
,cwm,2005-04-07T00:56Z,This game functions excellentlily!.
,Jay24mcr,2006-04-25T16:45Z,"Don't download this game! It's one of those Prism3d Activemark 60min trials. After 60 mins you either buy or uninstall.

There are cracks for Activemark but they only work if your OS resides on C: and you haven't used up all 60mins of the trial."
,Jay24mcr,2006-04-25T16:52Z,"This could be bad news for game torrents, now that Activemark has hit the market, all Games you download could be 60 min trials cleverly disguised as BIN or ISO files.

Unless you have experience with C++, PE Explorer and SoftICE, at the moment there is no hope of playing these games for longer than 60 mins


Torrenteers Beware! :("
