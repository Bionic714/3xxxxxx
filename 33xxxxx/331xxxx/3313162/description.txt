Det här är mitt första försök med CCE-omkodning. Var tvungen att pressa ner bitraten rätt så mycket (2580) men jag tycker ändå att det ser bättre ut än vad en DVDShrink spottar ut på samma bitrate. Jag valde att behålla DTS-spåret då det redan finns en DVDR-release av EMERALD med Dolby Digital.


This is my first shot at a CCE-reencode. I had to push the bitrate quite low (2580) but I think it looks better than what DVDShrink would spits out at this bitrate. I choose to keep DTS as there already exists a DVDR-release by EMERALD with Dolby Digital.

Alexander
 
Conquering 90% of the known world by the age of 25, Alexander the Great (Farrell) led his armies through 22,000 miles of sieges and conquests in just eight years. Coming out of tiny Macedonia, Alexander led his armies against the mighty Persian Empire, drove west to Egypt, and finally made his way east to India. This film will concentrate on those eight years of battles, as well as his relationship with his boyhood friend and battle mate, Hephaestion. Alexander died young, of illness, at 33. Alexander's conquests paved the way for the spread of Greek culture (facilitating the spread of Christianity centuries later), and removed many of the obstacles that might have prevented the expansion of the Roman Empire. In other words, the world we know today might never have been if not for Alexander's bloody, yet unifying, conquest.
