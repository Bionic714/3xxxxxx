,myrn,2005-04-12T10:38Z,Works for me. Be sure to remove the old key in the Kerio subdirectory if you're upgrading.
,Mecca,2005-04-16T13:51Z,"Skr채p ""crack""
Fungerar inte s책 ladda inte hem."
,lornloxor,2005-04-28T12:35Z,You have to shut down the firewall before using the crack.
,Kiddoo,2005-05-10T19:25Z,"Don't work for me. When I press the ""register"" button on the crack. I get the mess. : Can't open EXE.file.

It's a shame. I want Kerio. I don't want ZA."
,zakros71,2005-05-15T11:55Z,"It works. You don't have to close Kerio and you have to COPY THE KEYGEN IN THE KERIO INSTALLATION FOLDER. Then just run it, select Kerio 4.1.3, write a company name (whatever) and a mail (whatever) and press OK. That's it. :)"
,zakros71,2005-05-15T11:57Z,"Ehm, perhaps you have to exit Kerio first, I'm not sure about that. The rest is OK."
,Lekton,2005-05-21T08:30Z,"It works. You have to mark Personal Firewall 4.1.3 not the 4.1.2. I did that mistake. 

Thank You.
