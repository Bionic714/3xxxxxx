[T],sickboy88,2005-04-26T20:27Z,"I take DESOXYN, which is D-Methamphetamine HCl in easy to carry 5mg tablets.  I take them every day, between 10-70mg depending on how I feel.  The rest of the world only get's Amphetamine from the doctor, but here, in the good old USA, we get Methamphetamine as well.  I can get a prescription of Cocaine HCl even, if I were so inclined.

It's only a small part of what I take every day, as a remedy to getting exposed to nerve gas in the military and not dying like I was supposed to.

Right now, I just finished a 13 week taper of xanax and klonopin...and I must say, benzodiazapines are the most vile drug ever created.  I can't feel parts of my face, and forgot how to swallow yesterday"

,badassnoodle,2007-07-15T21:44Z,"I think I'll be moving to America and find a goood doctor too. Sickboy I hope you didnt stick a picture of  a concentration camp in front of this movie, it spoils my mood"
,kakkoister,2007-08-23T11:20Z,"NECATOR: You must be about 13 years old? I'm guessing you're school teachers have been telling you those little stories about how drugs kill braincells which makes you become stupid.
And then they show you those false brain images lol.

 If you're a smart person, You'll do you're own research about drugs on the internet, and not let yourself be spoonfed those lies teachers tell you to make you stay away from drugs.

 Many drugs are ok to do, As long as you're educated about the risks, and know how much you should be taking.

 Idiots who abuse drugs every single day, are the ones who start to get a degrading brain :)."

,InspectorLupus,2009-02-17T01:21Z,DRUGS DRUGS DRUGS! :D
,cbtalker205,2009-03-10T07:37Z,I am downloading this now! Thanks for putting this up. I saw it when I was younger and have been looking for it ever since.
,xt001x,2009-04-04T21:11Z,"haha. poor n00b. Dexmethamphetamine HCl is nothing more than glorified attention medicine, which I routinely did up to excess of 160mg, granted the come down sucked. Try some real crank, like crystal, then brag. w00t to not sleeping for 7 days"
,69Kalypso,2009-04-25T01:13Z,"Hi Sickboy :)  Thank you so MUCH! I have never seen this movie before. It is so realistic, like I think I used to know those exact people way back when... I didn't realize that these characters were exactly the same everywhere!
     The quality of your upload is SUPERB!
Anybody who has anything negative to say to you can eat shit!   
  You are sharing a movie and if they don't like your comments-they shouldn't watch the movie that you uploaded with love:)
    Oh yeah, I am a person with ADHD and am rx'd Dexedrine (up to 160mg. a day) and Klonipin.  For us ppl who need it it is indispensible ;)
    I am seeding on and off. My laptop can't be on 24/7 or it'll burn out. 
    THANKS FOR THE GREAT MOVIE MY FRIEND!!! 
    PEACE!!!

,movietime74,2009-07-20T03:34Z,very nice upload sickboy as always great quality killer movie if u guys dig this one check out iowa another brutal meth movie enjoy!.... pass the foil
,siiix,2009-09-15T08:02Z,"thank you for this version , i love this movie, and i love hanging out occasionally with losers like in the movie and get some meth"
,Chelseamaz,2010-01-17T02:16Z,"Hey sickboy88, ignore robbie1412, hes a fuckin douche bag that probably has never even seen a pill stronger then an asprin in his life. sry i fuckin hate that judge mental bullshit ignorant people play. And i agree with xt001x, no pill can make up for the real thing. This film took it to the extreme but the high is pretty accurate, lol. this film just cracked me the fuck up, being a fellow tweeker and/or drug experimentalist, i found both truths and exaggerations. staying up for days is surprisingly easy and the body high from crystal is euphoric. but hey you'll only find out for yourself, just i hope whoever reads this is safe about it. "
,PMac85,2010-07-28T00:49Z,"You people are all fucked. Fuckin meth heads. Good movie, but if anything i would think it would make you reaslise why NOT to get into meth. Go lean on your crutch and preach all your pro-meth bullshit, meth's one of the dirtyest drugs around. you're only lying to yourselves"
