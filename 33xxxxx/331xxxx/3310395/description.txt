Spun: Uncensored Director's Cut (UN Fucking RATED)

What a great fucking movie.  This version is 100 times better than the rated R version the rest of the word has seen.

There are shitloads of things that are better than the R version...here are a few examples:

1. Extended sock scene, shows dick
2. Full frontal nudity on tie down stripper sex
3. Graphic and extreme anime
4. You see too much of the fat woman
5. Mickey's pussy speech is not bleeped

It goes on and on...A must see.  I actually bought this DVD...I love methamphetamine...I use d-methamphetamine hcl or d-amphetamine sulfate DAILY...what a great movie. Check it out and see what you missed.

If you are going to watch this, you'll want to install the NEW XviD codec:

http://www.koepi.org/XviD-1.1.0-Beta1-16012005.exe

For top quality, make sure you use the XviD decoder configerator, and turn on
(Y) and (UV) deblocking, and the new feature of XviD 1.1.0 (Y) and (UV) DERINGING.

If you have a slow computer, turn it off.  I don't want another stupid motherfucker telling me that my movies are out of sync because they are totally computer illiterate.
