The story settings takes place on earth where alien`s attacks have turned into everyday sight instead of a mere rare phenomenon. All countries around the world have united their efforts to develop effective counter measures against the alien`s attack, but all without success.

In Japan (where else?), there is a secret organization called GRA (GRAND RIFUREKUTO AMUDO, "Grand Reflect Armor") under Alien Defense Agency direct control. The main purpose of this organization is to find a special counter measure against alien`s attack with help from Dr. Sanada Mio.

Dr. Sanada Mio invented a next-generation weapon which she called "G-on" to repel alien`s attack. This new secret weapon needs to be resonated with the heart of its user (has to be young girls! you know japanese anime/manga common approach for transformation equation :b) and it will turned into a sword which holds POWER proportional to the strength of the heart of the girl who uses it. Nevertheless to say, the new weapon and the plan are approved immediately and a special school is established to recruit young girls from across the country.
