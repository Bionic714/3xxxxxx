,spikefortress,2011-01-14T01:33Z,"to the uploader or anyone out there, is there any chance someone with 100% of this and other of brainticket's torrents to seed for a little bit again? Alot of the torrent seeders are sitting online at around 80% and 90% (if others are like me) hoping one of the older seeders will come back on for a while,,, just a fool's hope

ones i've got open and semi finished are (torrent names not listing titles): yu, karthago, fire, Aunt Mary, heavy, ugly1, omega plus, brosel, paternoster.

i would really appreciate and all those peers sitting there would too, i'm sure some of us will stick around and keep the offerings alive"
