However, since Men Behind the Sun is a true story.... Well, I'm downloading now..... 

Thanks for the post!!!"
,dseek2,2005-07-30T21:25Z,Thanks for this gruesome reminder of man's inhumanity. This movie has horrors and morality that's better experienced by film than in real..I couldn't get Real Alternative going on either BSPlayer or Mediaplayer Classic but Realplayer works. Thanks for sharing!
