     moby may have stolen his thunder on play but st germain, aka       
     ludovic navarre, has been showcasing his futuristic nous and love  
     of roots music by funking up the 4/4 electronic world with a little
     blues and gospel since the early 90s. after his f-communications   
     swan song, from detroit to st germain in 98, navarre worked with a 
     host of great session musicians for this, his major label debut.   
     tourist, his first album for the legendary blue note label,        
     certainly justifies the continuing hype. a perfectly formed melodic
     journey of eclectic and idiosyncratic deep house that mixes blues, 
     latin percussion and, of course, jazz  without the noodle factor,  
     tourist is likely to generate as much head-nodding as dancing down 
     your local groove emporium. the tracks range from the              
     straight-ahead blues cut, "rose rouge" to the aptly titled "so     
     flute", an afrobeat percussive shin-dig with a wondrous flute riff.
     "latin note", a funky latin stomper, reminiscent of nuyorican      
     soul/masters at work is packed full of minor chords, smashing beats
     and off-the wall dynamics. elsewhere, navarre proves himself a     
     master of suspense and beat-heavy poignancy, "pont des arts"       
     combines a carnival spirit with a monster piano groove, whereas    
     "what you think about" would have made roy ayers circa "everybody  
     loves the sunshine" very happy.tourist is the kind of album that is
     put on at a fantastic, idyllic beach bar stereo at sunset and then 
     constantly looped, a future classic.
