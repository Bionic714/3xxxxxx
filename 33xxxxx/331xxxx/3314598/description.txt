<p>A must have album
<p><b>This release was a limited pressing of only 10,000.</b>

<p>This beautiful music was inspired by "Les Mouches" by Jean-Paul Sartre.

<p>Tragedy of Orestes and Electra is a limited-edition adaptation of Sartre's Les Mouches. The Cranes have written a chamber-music backdrop for Alison Shaw's narration, which floats over cellos and harpsichords. It's more of an interesting side-project than an actual album, and its ambitions often out-strip its achievements, but it is fascinating for hardcore Cranes fans.
