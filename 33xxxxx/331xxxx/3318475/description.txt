OrangeCD Catalog is the comprehensive music database program for cataloging your music in any format: CDs, DVDs, records, MP3 files or tapes. To add a new CD to the database, you just need to insert the CD in your computer, and OrangeCD will download all information from Internet. You don't have to type a single word. Filling your music CD database becomes quick and easy.

The resulting database can be used for browsing, searching, printing or exporting to any of the supported formats. Now you can quickly check if you own a specific album or song, find its exact location on CD shelf, print CD changer index sheet or calculate your total collection value for insurance purposes. You can create web pages with the list of all your albums and upload them to your website. The feel and look of the web pages is defined by templates and can be customized even if you know nothing about HTML language.
