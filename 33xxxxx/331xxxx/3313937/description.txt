<p>Jorge Reyes is a Shamanic practitioner. His ritualistic soundscapes are steeped in Mexican Native American traditions. That is Reyes' culture and he embraces the holistic spirituality of his ancestors. PreHispanic is one of the CDs in his pre-Columbian series.
<p>Reyes uses native acoustic instruments to create ethnic atmospheres draped in deep reverence. The only electronics involved are for amplification purposes. The totally natural sound design is a true wonder of beauty. The performance techniques and arrangement expertise take this disc to the limit. Reyes is a true pioneer of the perpendicular universe. <p>This CD is difficult to find. It will appeal to fans of Steve Roach, Suso Saiz, David Hudson, and Vidna Obmana. Because of both its rarity and quality, it is essential for all collectors.
