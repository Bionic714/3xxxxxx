,jonez,2005-04-07T12:47Z,"just realized that eps. 6 is missing...it was missing when I got it too.  I'll issue a fix for it. ;-)

enjoy bitches"
,Paynex,2005-04-07T18:20Z,Will you fix this torrent or will you put out episode6 separate??
,jonez,2005-04-07T22:22Z,"If you know how to re-submit this torrent with episode 6 (because i just got ahold of it) and replace the old one torrent, i'm all ears.

otherwise i'll have to release episode 6 seperately."
,Paynex,2005-04-07T22:35Z,"Hey, I dont know im a fucking noob when it comes to this shit:D"
,jonez,2005-04-07T23:21Z,"I emailed the admins,

if we can't find away to edit the torrent file itself and have the tracker force peers to redownload the file, then i'll either up ep 6 by itself or re-up th ewhole season and those who have all the other eps can just jump on."
