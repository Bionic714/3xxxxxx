,BitZoR,2005-04-21T14:04Z,It`s edition 9. Should have written this in filename. Sorry. 
,Inkorrekt,2005-07-04T12:40Z,Is it bundle?
,scunky,2007-03-02T21:18Z,RAR file has an error
,hihosilv,2008-02-21T06:11Z,Thanks it works great. Are there english instructions for installing sketch and toon? I don't read German.
,dodginess,2008-06-23T02:11Z,"Thanks for this :)

Does anyone know if Sketch and Toon can be installed in this version? When it asks you to select the directory that Cinema 4D is installed in it keeps complaining that it's the wrong one, then quits the installer...hihosilv - the instructions for Sketch and Toon (in English) are in the installer screens - the text file is just a German translation."
