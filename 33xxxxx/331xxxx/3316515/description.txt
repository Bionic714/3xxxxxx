A small village is renowned for its 'Ruby Glass' glass blowing works. When the foreman of the works dies suddenly without revealing the secret of the Ruby Glass, the town slides into a deep depression, and the owner of the glassworks becomes obssessed with the lost secret.


This is by no means a conventional film. The actors are said to be hypnotized which adds to the apocalyptic atmosphere of the film. It is like a work of art, a painting which gives us only a glimpse of the director's inner world.
