,rinfel,2006-02-28T18:15Z,"After about thirty-five minutes the moviepictures and sound don't synchronize anymore. The pictures stop now and then. 
I converted this avi file to a mpeg file. Does anyone know a solution to this problem?"
,rinfel,2006-03-01T19:35Z,"The problem is solved: i've used another program to convert.
Thanks for this great film."
,GreenTooth,2006-03-09T19:46Z,"And why not seed a bit, eh?"
,chicotree,2006-04-17T03:35Z,thanks for the movie. i am just becoming familiar with herzog's films thanks to torrents.
,russell1nash,2006-05-22T20:13Z,Just as with other Herzog torrents - or should i say freakyflicks torrents:) - PLEASE SEED!
,russell1nash,2006-05-28T14:26Z,"C'mon, guys, you all say how much you like this one, but you don't seem to seed for the rest of us!
Why don't you try to keep this one alive, give others a chance to see it as well? This is a rare movie and it's worth sooo much more interest from all of us! Pleeeease seed! I will do same!"
,russell1nash,2006-05-30T14:35Z,"After 21 1/2 hours (!!!), finally got this!
Seeding as promised!"
