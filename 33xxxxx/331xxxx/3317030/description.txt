Modeling tools for designers

Start with a sketch, drawing, physical model, or only an ideaâ€”Rhino provides the tools to accurately model your designs ready for rendering, animation, drafting, engineering, analysis, and manufacturing.


Rhino can create, edit, analyze, and translate NURBS curves, surfaces, and solids in Windows. There are no limits on complexity, degree, or size. Rhino also supports polygon meshes and point clouds. 

Special features include:

Uninhibited free-form 3-D modeling tools like those found only in products costing 20 to 50 times more. Model any shape you can imagine.

Accuracy needed to design, prototype, engineer, analyze, and manufacture anything from an airplane to jewelry.

Compatibility with all your other design, drafting, CAM, engineering, analysis, rendering, animation, and illustration software.

Read and repair extremely challenging IGES files.

Accessible. So easy to learn and use that you can focus on design and visualization without being distracted by the software.

Fast, even on an ordinary laptop computer. No special hardware is needed.

Affordable. Ordinary hardware. Short learning curve. Priced like other Windows software. No maintenance fees.
