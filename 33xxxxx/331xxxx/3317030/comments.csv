You don't happen to have a recent Flamingo too? =D"
,Simkon,2005-04-15T06:38Z,"Flamingo included..
Not tested thou."
,stardude,2005-04-15T10:38Z,"Hmm...getting an error when trying to install...
saying that it has detected Rhino running on the system and it must be closed before the install can be completed.

The trick is, I don't have Rhino installed on this machine, much less running =

What gives?"
,Simkon,2005-04-15T12:09Z,Open regedit. Search for rhino. Delete all found keys =)
,stardude,2005-04-15T12:31Z,"Thanks for the tip but I have never had Rhino installed on this hard drive. =

The last machine I tried Rhino on was scrapped 5 years ago."
,Simkon,2005-04-15T12:36Z,Just search and see  =)
,stardude,2005-04-15T12:45Z,"I did, the only instances are the ones pointing to the downloaded torrent =~("
,stardude,2005-04-15T12:50Z,"I even tried disconnecting the box from the net and shutting down all security in case it was a firewall issue, no go though =

Getting a feeling it's a protection feature since I've never seen something like this before."
,Simkon,2005-04-15T13:23Z,"Hmm.. I had the same problem. The thing I did was I deleted all reg keys that got hit by search rhino.

I also search't for rhino on my computer and deleted all found.

,jgrom30,2005-04-17T17:42Z,"Amazing! Lucky me, installed with no problems, having previous Rhino3 Evaluation on the same drive. I cleaned registry two days ago with RegClean or something. 
I use XP Pro SP2.
Problem is, this is old Rhino3, it calls for SR3 upgrade and without SR3 you can't use bonus tools which are very nice."
,HassiSan,2005-04-20T19:18Z,"U rule Simkon!!

,Ali8653,2007-11-24T01:15Z,"I downloaded this a month ago: this isn't the commercial version of rhino 3.0, this is the beta. The main problem with the beta version is that it's a little glitchy. I can't import picture frames or import texture, otherwise it just crashes. Sometimes it'll crash out of nowhere. To top it all off,  this beta version is incompatible with the bongo animation plug in. on the brighter side of things, everything else works fine and it is definetly better than the evaluation version"
