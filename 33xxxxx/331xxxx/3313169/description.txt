Ok, here it is, 1 of 2 requests for Ivo...

This is the crazy ass chinese zombie/humour flick from 1998.

I was lucky enough to have borrowed  a dvd with an english soundtrack...needless to say, I used it.  It's just about the most crazy dub job I've ever seen.  

It appears that Joey Lauren Adams from Mallrats, and the rest of Kevin Smith's films does one of the female voices...you'll hear it for sure.

Ivo asked me to hard encode the subtitles, but I was already into my second pass using an athlon 750, so I ripped the subtitles via OCR instead as an external .SRT pack...it's very easy to use...it even works under windows media player...just turn on subtitles, and make sure the .SRT pack is in the same dir, and named the same name, as the main .avi you are watching.

If you are going to watch this, you'll want to install the NEW XviD codec:

http://www.koepi.org/XviD-1.1.0-Beta1-16012005.exe

For top quality, make sure you use the XviD decoder configerator, and turn on
(Y) and (UV) deblocking, and the new feature of XviD 1.1.0 (Y) and (UV) DERINGING.

If you have a slow computer, turn it off. I don't want another stupid motherfucker telling me that my movies are out of sync because they are totally computer illiterate.
