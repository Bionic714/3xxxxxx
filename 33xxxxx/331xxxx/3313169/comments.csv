[T],sickboy88,2005-04-08T09:17Z,"Thanks.  I try to do 1-2 requests a week.  It's not that big of a deal.  I've had people do the same for me many a time before.

I've thought about posting my LIST before, but I think it would just make people ask for shit they didn't know they wanted. hahaha

Thanks duck, I think at a min, people should try to include vid specs and an imdb link.  I've downloaded tons of torrents only to be pissed off to find out that a movie was ac3, was not a true dvd-r, but rather SHRUNK, etc.

It's nice to have a heads up, epecially with the low bandwidth solutions my country provides.

Did you know a limited bandwidth 256kbps upstream, 2.5mbit downstream connection in the USA runs 3-4 times as much money as a 10mbit UNLIMITED bandwidth connection in Sweden?  It's bullshit.  WE pioneered the internet as arpanet, for post nuclear holocaust connectivity, and look, you have people in bulgaria and sweden shitting out 10mbits while we suck on adsl and SHITTY dsl and cable.

 Many thx to the uploader cheers"
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-11T04:29Z,"The way it works with spanish in the USA, is, that a wetback comes over here (illegal alien) and doesn't speak a fucking word of english.  Not one fucking word.  They get free money, food, medical care...everything.  If I get sick, I fucking die, or pay thousands of dollars, because, since I am not an illegal alien, I DON'T GET insurance.

THEN, when you go to mexico ALL OF THEM speak english so they can SELL YOU SHIT.  It's bullshit.  I'd like to sit on the border with a .50 cal and turn them into crimson pudding.

Your english is great."
,kckc1983,2005-04-15T07:28Z,"Hi sickboy88! Terrific job.

,m0t0psych0,2009-04-17T13:25Z,"Hey sickboy, awesome rip! I was just wondering if you have the Jon McBride film, The Woodchipper Massacre? If so, can you please upload it?"
,TOXIK88,2009-07-31T01:55Z,"you have one of the best collections of torrents on this site, i registered just to leave that message for you. keep up the good work. btw we get free health care here in canada which is pretty cool. 

but when the immigrants come here, legal or illegal, they get a free house, job, groceries, money, all my blood sweat and tears lifting lumber all day and 100$ tax off of my paycheck (canadian, close to american dollar) that goes to these fucking rats and i never see it again. Busting my balls for barely enough to get by not to mention i have to work with these morons. The only pleasure i get is when i see these people in February when its -30 degrees celcius (around -22 degrees fh) and the bus driver leaves them in the cold because theres too many of them on the bus already. "
,TOXIK88,2009-07-31T01:56Z,I definitely want to see this so called list of yours
,Supar78,2009-09-25T16:10Z,how to give seed`?
[T],InternetNinjacy,2010-01-22T01:16Z,"Thanks for this, I love this movie. I'll seed at least as much as I download. Probably more. 

And, for the people that asked, when you finish downloading this, just leave your torrent program open and don't delete the movie from it either. Unless you're evil or have a shitty program it should just seed it automatically. I don't know your program but out of the few I've used most tell me how much I've seeded, just try to keep it at least 1:1. (Download:Upload)"
