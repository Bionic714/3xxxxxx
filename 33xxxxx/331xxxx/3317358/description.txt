How does it works:

It cheats (hooks user32.dll! GetSystemMetrics(SM_CLEANBOOT) & ntdll.dll!NtLockProductActivation)
winlogon.exe to make it believe it was booted in safemode and so winlogon skips
the WPA-Check.
The patch is 'autorun' on eachs start before the WPA-check via
HKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionWinlogonNotifyAntiWPA

The hooks are applied when AntiWPA.dll!onLogon was load by winlogon.exe
Winlogon.exe is not altered anymore. Patching (API-Hooking) is done in Memory.
So there are no problems with the windows System File Protection anymore.

Installation is performed via AntiWPA.dll!DllRegisterServer ("regsvr32 AntiWPA.dll").
The file is copied to systemdir and the registrykeys are added.
(Note: AntiWPA.dll is no ActiveX selfregisterdll.)
Uninstallation is performed via AntiWPA.dll!DllUnRegisterServer ("regsvr32 -u AntiWPA.dll").

Den skall fungera att ta bort aktiveringen på Windows XP x64, alltså det som EcHos "crack" inte gjorde.
