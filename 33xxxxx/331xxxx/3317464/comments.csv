,Liwa,2005-04-16T03:16Z,does this work for real or is it another fake
,Freestuff,2005-04-16T03:23Z,"It's just a patch, you need a keygen for it, then it should work."
,Gabry,2005-04-16T04:36Z,....and where is keygen ?
,mongalism,2005-04-16T05:36Z,"i cant play without a crack
very hard to find a starforce crack."
,diol,2005-04-16T08:52Z,"it is not a crack 
it is a starforce patch that no one really knows what it does exactly
it might fuck up and mess with your system"
,poipoipoi,2005-04-16T10:49Z,this patch may cause herpes.
,Liwa,2005-04-16T11:38Z,"does it work or not i want to know
is it a< fake or does it work"
,diol,2005-04-16T12:38Z,no one even knows exactly what this crap was supposed to be used for.. sorry for the bad language.
,downloads,2005-04-16T12:41Z,"You don't need a keygen. The ""key error"" is just bull, people with USB drives play using them. It's just a way of telling you that you don't have the right DVD (SecuROM 7 says your graphic hardware wasn't detected).
As for the patch it updates SF, but what's wrong is it's been created on April 13th and the official one (with older SF ver) is March 28th. WTF?"
,SkyWitch,2005-04-21T11:17Z,"Still i like yo know....do i need a real key or not..??

Anyone with a solution...????"
