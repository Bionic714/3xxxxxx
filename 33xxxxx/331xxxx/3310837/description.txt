This release combines both the Mac OS X Panther for CherryOS and PearPC ISO-n00bs and the PearPC Manual for Team n00bs Mac OS X written by Matt (and not Team n00bs). THEREFORE, DO NOT CONSIDER THIS AN OFFICIAL TEAM N00bS RELEASE

The original Team n00bs Mac OS X release without the manual can be found at http://trackerwww.prq.to/torrents-details.php?returnto=%2Faccount-cp.php&id=3303338

NOTE: I'm not seeding this torrent since I do not have the file. Matt, who has made this torrent, will be doing so. I have merely uploaded it for him.
