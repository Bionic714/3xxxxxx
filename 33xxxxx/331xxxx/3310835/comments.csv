,Raped_Nun,2005-04-03T03:45Z,Do you have the rest of the sesons?
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-03T04:21Z,"Yes, but it is not practicle to upload a 27gig torrent.  I'll be uploading the whole series in it's entirety. 

I have two requests on wed, Wild Zero and Bio-Zombie, but after that, I will continue with the series until it's finished.

I'm doing one disk at a time, 7 episodes per disk."
