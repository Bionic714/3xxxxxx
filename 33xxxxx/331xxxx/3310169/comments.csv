What are the labels up to? spending all their time watching the MGM case? I have a few of these tracks on a cassette that I bought for ÂŁ5 of a guy in Camden Market, it was like finding golddust, that bad man Nick, ranting live... So I will buy the CD, and I will play it to my friends, and they will buy it... its really that simple, share the goldust."
