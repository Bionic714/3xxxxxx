 Since the early 80's, FRONT 242's ever-growing fanbase has always proven to be
 the 5th member of the band. A unique communion between fan and artist that has
 grown and matured over the course of more than two decades.
 An interactive relationship that has displayed its intensity during every
 'tour de force' live performance where the energy of the audience seamlessly
 unites with the energy of the band, together creating an incredible experience,
 an experience witnessed by thousands around the globe. Before the release of
 their next album, and after the astounding success of the re-release of their
 debut album "Geography" as a Limited Edition, and to thank the FRONT 242
 community for 25 years of staunch support through their quite unusual path,
 Patrick Codenys, Daniel B., Jean-Luc De Meyer and Richard Jonkheere now deliver
 to their steadfast fans a true and rich treasure, the first official FRONT 242
 live DVD showing the band at its best during the impressive August 2004
 performance in Lokeren ( Belgium ) in front of more than 17,000 people.
 This is a unique opportunity for the fans of electronic music to forever own
 a true piece of music history on DVD, immortalizing the legend and genius of
 Front 242.
