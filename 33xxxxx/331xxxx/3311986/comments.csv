,Norvegia,2005-04-04T22:21Z,"To whoever has voted 1 star, say at least what's wrong with the torrent so I can do better in the future, ne?"
,rooster719,2005-04-04T22:57Z,You're doing great Norvegia ! Really cool ! 
,takeru,2005-04-05T09:31Z,great collection! great work! thank you for ripping & seeding!
,takeru,2005-04-05T09:33Z,"...i forgot to say ""you can only do better than this... doing it again and again next months"" :-)"
,s4ndm4n,2005-04-05T11:11Z,...April? Does that mean we'll be getting a pack each month? Would be cool in that case ;)
,Norvegia,2005-04-05T11:47Z,"Thanks all for the compliments ;) I can't promise anything, but my intention is to make, at least, one torrent each month. In the case of april, it is likely there is gonna be another one, so keep your eyes open ;)"
,cbenezra,2005-04-13T00:43Z,"Oy!  I want to see these so bad, but I only get sound.  What is wrong with my stupid computer?!"
,Norvegia,2005-04-13T01:48Z,"cbenezra, do you have Divx, XviD or FFDShow installed? If yes, it could be that you have any other codec installed that conflicts with those mentioned. Try uninstalling and reinstalling only the ones you really need.

Hope this helps."
