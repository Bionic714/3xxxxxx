not that i'm saying this one is fake...

but if a few people could confirm it's authenticity, that'd be nice."
,c01L,2005-04-19T15:49Z,"I'm Sure that is the real one, i've checked 8 else albums, and that's it !"
,c01L,2005-04-19T16:09Z,So many leechers... i've got slow connection :( only 30 kB/s in/out
,TheAbsorbant,2005-04-19T17:14Z,"This is probably, like the other ones, James LaBrie's latest solo album ""Elements of Persuasion""... Just 'cause it's Dream Theater's singer, doesn't mean its them..."
,TheAbsorbant,2005-04-19T17:28Z,"Yep, this is James LaBrie's solo album ""Elements of Persuasion"", I've sampled it now. It's not even the full album!!"
,poipoipoi,2005-04-19T17:38Z,"confirmed! it's LaBrie's new album (8/12ths of it anyway), NOT the new DT.

i downloaded one track (""octavarium"") and it is identical to LaBrie's ""Drained"" (track 12 on his ""elements of persuasion"").

c01L, you may wanna change the title / description before people get pissed off at you / ban you! (coulda happened to anyone, i wouldnt worry about it too much. thanks for trying!)

,TheAbsorbant,2005-04-19T18:06Z,"It's a good album, though... ""Someone"" should put that up... ""Crucify"" was a bit of a shock, almost thrash metal!!"
,scan83,2005-04-19T18:13Z,I've to confirmed positiv on LaBrie on this one.. Can someone put up the last four songs of it?
,erikla2002,2005-04-19T18:15Z,"Fake, why bother? bah"
,poipoipoi,2005-04-19T18:51Z,"i'll seed Elements of Persuasion, do a search in a couple minutes. :)"
,c01L,2005-04-19T19:41Z,yeah... i'm not big fan of Dream Theater so i apologize for that mistake :( forgive me please :(
,Johan_Ask,2005-05-07T23:44Z,"CAN YOU PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE SEED THIS !!!
