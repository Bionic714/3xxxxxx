,shredder85,2005-04-09T09:34Z,Seed anyone? PLEEEAAAASE?
,Sanjuro,2005-04-10T01:32Z,"A classic and pretty much a must see. The more prior experience you have from anime/manga the funnier it gets since there is a lot of reference-type humor. That aside it is still a good watch even for the ""beginners"".
Also, Excel Saga belongs to the *very very* small group of animes that has a suberb english dub so if you find the dual-audio version of it don't hesitate to get it."
,Atarian,2005-04-11T16:12Z,hr hr.. Den som orkar se mer än 2 episoder förtjänar diplom. 
,JayTheHated,2005-04-12T09:29Z,"2 episoder om gangen blir litt hardt på hjernen stakkar, ja :D Men se mer enn 2 episoder totalt går ufattelig lett, imo. Men jeg liker denne typen anime da :P Hvis det er noe særlig ønske om det skal jeg seede Puni Puni Poemy Matroska rip og :P"
,shredder85,2005-04-12T14:10Z,"Puni Puni Poemy...
er det anime av typen gal humor?

vi vil ha!"
,JayTheHated,2005-04-13T04:23Z,"Vil nesten påstå at den er mer insane en Excel Saga, og det er Shinichi Watanabe (samme regissøren som lagde Excel Saga) som står bak Puni Puni Poemy og, så ja :D

Trist at det bare er 2 episoder, men jeg skal legge det opp."

,Phaux_The_Fox,2008-12-22T11:39Z,"damn it, why can't this shit ever be in english
i dont have a problem with Japanese and subs, but when i watch something on my comp, i'm normally doing something else so i use to as background noise and something i can looked at every so often, but i can do that with subs"
,ferjero,2009-03-15T20:31Z,"anime with english audio = sucks

when they draw the anime/manga they think about the noise and audio it has... and the english dubber/voice cast doesnt have the knowlegde/feelings nor the idea the animator was trying to inject into the anime. 
thats basically why english audio in anime suxs big time. so far.. i havent seen an anime which english audio is ""good"" "

,LadyBlackArachnia,2011-03-29T03:58Z,I hate how people always dis the English language! Not everything has to be Japanese! I mean I am okay with it SOMETIMES! It's a pain in the butt to keep up with the subtitles and I don't even know what's going on half the time. Learn the language you say but what for when most of the actors are female. Like Naruto. There are not many different voices as there are with the English language. Most Japanese voices sound the same. Either too high or too low. While English has many types of vocals that are amazing! Like Christian Bale in Howls Moving Castle.
,rezabrando,2011-09-11T05:00Z,One of the BEST series I've ever seen. THANKS.
,krysoul,2012-03-15T07:49Z,"Been downloading for 4 days and i'm barely @ 50%.
