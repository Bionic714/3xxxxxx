        Built on the legacy of the fearsome film franchise,           
        Predator: Concrete Jungle features a thrilling story that     
        showcases quality gameplay with the signature abilities         
        and weapons of the Predator in new futuristic settings.          
        Gamers will hunt down their prey in an urban killing zone         
        as they take on the legendary role of the Predator. In            
        Predator: Concrete Jungle, the gripping tale of the               
        fearsome alien's history on Earth unfolds between two             
        separate time periods, first the 1930s and then in the            
        2030s, as the Predator embarks on a mission of revenge            
        upon a organized crime empire and its leader who seeks to         
        conquer all Predators. Taking inspiration from the popular        
        film franchise, the game allows players to roam the city          
        landscape, stalking human prey while armed to the teeth           
        with hunt-adapted vision modes, cloaking technology and           
        extraterrestrial weapons of annihilation.
