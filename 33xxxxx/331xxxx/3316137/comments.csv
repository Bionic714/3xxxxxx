,Rusty_Nails,2005-04-13T19:35Z,"Um, in-case you didn't notice, this torrent is about Predator: Concrete Jungle [!], so please stick to that, alright?

I'm currently at ~8%. Can't wait to play this game, since I'm a huge Predator (and Alien too for that matter)-fan. Thanks for uploading!

So how was the game? I left the download on overnight, it wasn't until a few hours ago when I came home from school that I realized I didn't have any space left on my drive.. -_-

,singsing82,2005-05-06T12:33Z,"Hey guys... Sorry but I have a smal problem with this one. At level 3 the hole game freezes up and I get rebooted to the Evo dashboard. So does anyone else have this problem? It's when I fire upon the first boss. Game freezes, reboot... weird. Never had that happen to me in any game. So, it shouldn't be anything wrong with the DVD laber, cus Ihave used it before without any problems of any cind. Anyone have an idea?"
,master_chief,2005-08-01T00:19Z,"How can people like this game? How can they even waste their time downloading it? Has anyone even read a review from one or more respectable gamesites? This game is crap, dudes. It stinks! From what I've heard, one of the reviewers choked himself to death after playing this game. Download at own risk!"
