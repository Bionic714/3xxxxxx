One of the real milestones in film history Battleship Potemkin is one of Sergei Eisensteins masterpieces. Despite being Soviet propaganda at its time the film is really fascinating considering the time of production.
Many of the films revolutionary features became standard, specially when Hollywood discovered the techniques used a decade later. The Odessa steps scene still serves as an example of excellent cinematography.

CHARLIE CHAPLIN said it was his favourite movie.
