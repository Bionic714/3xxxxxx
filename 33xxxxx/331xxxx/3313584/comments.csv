,brainticket,2005-04-08T01:51Z,Is this correct? Is this the full album - doesn't link up to any of Omega's 70s discography.....
,brainticket,2005-04-08T02:02Z,"...okay got it now, this is infact a 4 tracker released on Bellaphon - these were English language versions of songs previously-recorded in Hungarian for the German market (I assume the guys in Omega didn't speak German?). This was their 2nd English language release.
According to their English discography Suite should be a single track, but haven't verified visually."
,Scabben,2005-04-08T19:35Z,"Correct, I did split Suite into two parts. A bit more conveniant to handle in my mp3-player... BTW this was actually a MC-rip. I did the MC myself some 20 yrs ago. Keep that in mind when juging the quality, its a third generation copy ! And my notes say that the original record was released in 1973."
