In the seedy world of underground raves people are vanishing without a trace and Detective Hank Holten is the only one who knows the terrible truth-vampires are preying on the young party-goers. As Hank delves deeper and deeper into this bloody case, the horrors he witnesses take a toll on his mind and his superiors begin to question his sanity. But when Hank is bitten by the leader of the vampires he must become the hunter and destroy these creatures before they can claim more victims and before Hank loses his very soul.
