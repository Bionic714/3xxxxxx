,GoodBoy,2005-04-09T14:52Z,"Thanks for the great post - and all you guys out there, just relax, it's not a dangerous file. The mpeg movie is extracted in this way (and it's worth it):

1. Open winrar and extract 'french girl.exe'. 

2. open 'french girl.exe' (don't dbl.click) with winrar and extract the mpeg.

Thats it!

Just remember never to dbl.click an unknown exe-file unless you know what it is, then you should be safe. "
