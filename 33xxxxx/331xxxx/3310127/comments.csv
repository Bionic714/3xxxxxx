,Jeff,2005-04-07T11:47Z,"Filmen är underbar och mangan finns sedan länge utgiven på svenska som Gen, Pojken från Hiroshima. Men undertexterna måste ha vart bland det sämsta jag sett. Hemskt osynkade. Tack iallafall!"

Quality is not the greatest but then again, the movie is from 1983.

Its Japanese audio with English subtitles. Use VLC media player to watch.

Many thanks."
