O&O Defrag V8.0 Server Edition is not only the ideal choice for all 
Windows-based servers, but also includes O&O Defrag Network Management, 
enabling the administration of the O&O Defrag software across an entire 
network. In addition, O&O Defrag boasts a built-in software distributor 
(O&O ComponentInstaller) that makes the installation of software on client 
computers a matter of a few mouse clicks. Updates can also be easily 
integrated into the network by way of an intelligent version monitoring 
system. 
In terms of client software, O&O Defrag V8.0 Server Edition comes with its 
own O&O Defrag Agent that only needs to be installed once. After the Defrag 
Agent is installed, all communication with the console will be 
automatically managed. This means that as soon as a new computer is added 
to the network, or the console detects a computer running without an agent 
installed, the administrator will be given that choice to install that 
agent. No additional settings or installations are necessary. All actions 
are taken automatically and without any risk to the security of Windows.
