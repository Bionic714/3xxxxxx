,willem1,2005-04-14T21:39Z,Move to the tv category please
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-14T22:35Z,Good catch. I've been making a lot of mistakes today.  The new place I moved into is too loud and my roomates chain-smoke.  I can't fucking sleep.  Perhaps I will encode a quality xvid of me smashing their heads in with a ball-peen hammer.
,bonega,2005-04-15T00:55Z,"Nice. 
Finally good quality rips to replace my old ones :)
Thnx"

[T],sickboy88,2005-04-16T02:41Z,sickboy88 <--- bends  Nizze_cky2k over and covers their ass in his seed.

,fsa,2005-04-19T19:40Z,"Could you rip the extra dvds? Please?
Good work btw."
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-22T11:15Z,"There are no extra ones.  I own this, I actually bought it.  I had to borrow the second part, which is why I have no scans of the boxes, but I can assure you, there isn't anything else in the series, other than director's commentary."
,landenstad,2005-06-05T09:00Z,Skitbra. Men vart e disc 2? Såg den igår tror jag men nu är den borta :(
,FistGimp,2005-06-08T00:22Z,please seed ppl ! I´ll do it as fast I´ve got something.
[T],sickboy88,2006-03-12T23:00Z,"Yeah, I'll put it out on usenet though, as I can't connect to the tracker here."
