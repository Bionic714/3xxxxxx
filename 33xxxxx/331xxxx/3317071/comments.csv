,DogshitTaco,2005-04-15T19:13Z,"At one point i said that i didn't have season 5, but that changed... ;)

I will not advertise what i'm going to release. You will just have to wait and see... :P
Just can't be too cautious with idiots like APB running around! You never know if they are gonna hack your computer..."
