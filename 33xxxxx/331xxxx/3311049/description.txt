This is poker tournament is aired LIVE with a 5-minute delay. Really good players (Phil Ivey, John Juanda, Paul Phillips) and Howard Lederer as an expert commentator. The best part in this is that you see EVERY hand on the final table! It's not just a highlight show, you get to see every hand.

This is the best poker tournament I've seen on TV! Worth downloading!
