Peter Jackson's DEAD ALIVE...the most violent movie ever made.  Mind blowing violence...

When the one guy gets his legs eaten off on the thighs, and all you see is bone...that's pretty fucking sick.

This version is only missing a scene at the start where it shows the NZ flag, 4 seconds or so before the closet scene, and about 6 seconds of zombies fucking.  You still get to see them fuck, and it was a poorly done scene anyway.

I couldn't stop laughing the entire movie...the violence will make you laugh.  I can't believe this movie...the lawnmower...the gnome stuck in the one guy's neck...the weird uncle and his meat cleavers.

There are so many creative deaths in this film...I can't even go into it.  It's fucking foul...it starts off kind of slow, but give it 20 minutes or so, and you will be glued to the screen.

This is the kind of movie that you make all of your friends watch.  I would buy numerous copies of this if I could even find it for sale, and make sure everyone I knew had a real copy - It's that good.

I kick ass for the lord!
