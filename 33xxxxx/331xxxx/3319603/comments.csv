,jayteepee,2005-04-21T06:37Z,I think that no one is leeching only one fil at a time.... that might be a problem for you or what....???
,jayteepee,2005-04-21T06:42Z,U really got some issues man... go see a shrink!!!!
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-21T06:47Z,"Man, 

What is 100/4?

It's 25 right?  Let's pretend that someone has a 100kps upstream (700kbps), that's 4 torrents right there at 20k...that leaves enough overhead to get fast downloads and have the net still be usable.

So, if someone is uploading at only 5kps, then...wow...that's, what....20 torrents they have going?  No way.

People are setting their upstream cap to nearly jack shit.
The last version of ABC even had a NO UPLOAD option.

Now let's assume that they have a 10mbit connection, which is so cheap and common in Sweden....

Do you want to do the math?  10000/7=1428.57/5=285

285 torrents that person would need open, at 5kps to consume 10mbit.

I don't think that that theory is going to pan out."

They said the very same thing about jesus, and look how that turned out.  "

No.  Jesus was nothing more than a kike on a popsicle stick.  "
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-21T08:33Z,"jone4711,

Thanks for that!  I must say, that is the all around BEST string of jibberish I've had the pleasure to lay my eyes upon in what, the last 9 years?  Thanks!"
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-21T09:25Z,"Rasulmin,

Thanks brother, it's so nice to have someone to take the load off of my shoulders a little bit.  I really REALLY appreciate the extra help.  You're going WAY beyond what is considered good seeding."
,Rasulmin,2005-04-21T09:29Z,"Just happy to help.
I dont need the bandwidth now anyway.:D"
,Rasulmin,2005-04-21T09:39Z,"Btw. this movie is called ""braindead"" not ""dead alive"" I downloaded this 4monthe ago. But i keep on seeding, it such a cool movie."
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-21T10:09Z,"Actually, it's DEAD ALIVE in the USA, and BRAIN DEAD everywhere else.  The cd, box, EVERYTHING say DEAD ALIVE.

Why they did that?  Read at the end.

You can check these out for pictures of the box, so that you can better understand what I am saying.

I think they chose a different name in USA so that it would not be confused with this movie by the same name:

,tangled,2005-04-21T15:36Z,"sickboy88: keep it up, I like your style :)
too bad the torrent 'community' is full of retards who don't know what they're doing. but I guess that's the way it goes."
,jayteepee,2005-04-21T16:59Z,"I just think that you should try to accept thar not all of us can be as professional at this as you sicko...;-)
But I respect that you after all is trying to help ""the retards"".
I can only upload at speed 52 KB/s, so thats only two torrents after your standards....
i had a couple of other torrents with more leechers than this one, so my priorities wasn't this one at the time, but when you talked about putting everybody that wouldn't upload at 20 KB/s on the guardian list, I totally removed this one from my client. Thats not nice....
The fact that you stayed home from work just to do that says that you use to much time at making torrents and to little on your self... I think you should take a breather for a couple of days.... the torrent world will survive without you for a couple of days... trust me;-)
Dont think that I dont understand the frustration..."
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-21T22:02Z,"Just about every cover the movie came out with on this link:

,dealinx,2005-04-28T18:36Z,"Late to the party, but I just felt the need to add something:

Not everyone even has 20k upstream.  My max upstream is technically 128kbit, but it tops out at around 14k

likewise, you'll find 90% of australians will either have an 8k or 16k limit on their connection.  Hopefully this will start to change soon, but the point remains - not all connections have the same bandwidth, and so you shouldn't lump everyone into a basket based on your connection speed."
,dealinx,2005-04-28T18:40Z,"heh.. ""if only I'd clicked the first page of comments""

yeah.. I didn't read that was in the first 24 hours (ie: before there were enough seeds to carry the torrent) - ignore my rant above :p"
[T],sickboy88,2005-07-28T04:29Z,"One of the 2300 people that downloaded this, must be able to seed this for this dude for 10 min? WTF?"
[T],sickboy88,2005-08-02T11:22Z,"Easliy one of the top 3 movies i've shared, but no one downloads it...odd..."
,roland69uk,2006-01-04T15:41Z,"will sum1 plwase seed this, thanks"
