Here's the the fourth Omega album in my collection. Its called Omega 3 and was released in 1974. In includes my favourite "I go away" which, I think, had a potential to be a megahit if it wasn't made by an Hungarian band (U know, wrong side of the iron curtain...) This is a hand-washed vinyl rip (Original Swedish handicraft ;-))).
