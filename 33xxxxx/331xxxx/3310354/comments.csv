PM me"
,martinalexa,2005-04-03T13:15Z,"Actually, I got problems with this one too! :-(

I tried to boot the burned image on my G3 B/W 450mhz, but I got this problem:

First I saw a gray floppy-disk with a question-mark on, and after a while the mousepointer disappeared and the floppy was replaced with a mac plus or mac classic or some other old mac with a blue smiley on the screen, and then it just freezes... I tried to wait for about half an hour, but nothing happened!!!

Well, I have bought a new copy and get it tomorrow (monday)!!!

Tugh luck =P!"
,svenbertil,2005-04-03T14:32Z,"Why do you seed an ancient OS? Why not at least 9.2.2, the last version of classic?"
,res1492,2005-04-06T21:18Z,"I put up this version for a mate
If you need 9.2.2 i have that aswell

,ciprianc,2005-07-27T08:59Z,"i have mac os x 3 installed and i want 9.1 also because of some games require it.I downloaded this dmg, burned it on cd with disk utility and i tried booting up holding c.I could hear the cdrom spinning the cd hard and trying to boot from it but nothing.It still boots my os x.
I also chose from os x to boot from the cd and the same thing happend.
I even tried to install it from os x (running Mac Os Install from the cd) and it gives me some errors.
How can i have classinc AND x installed?I currently only have X."

,scttkrkwd,2006-04-05T07:10Z,"same issue as ciprianc.
burned to cd and try to boot it and it just goes to os10.4.6. also it doesnt show as a bootable disk when you start computer and hold OPTION key. looks like its a version that came with a computer, meaning it wont boot other models. i'm using imacG4 FP 17inch."
,ovisnigra,2006-06-10T18:32Z,"I finished the domnload. Haven't tested it yet, but looks OK.

Thanks res192, I also was looking for this for a long time. Want to install it in an old iMac.

For the people who wants 9.2.2: You can install 9.1, and then download the avaiable updates directly from the Apple site

http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=75288

,jc4jv,2008-12-17T02:44Z,"Corrupt Corrupt Corrupt Corrupt Corrupt
res1492, your skills with disk images need improving big time!"
,freqazoidiac,2009-03-08T03:35Z,"this burns fine, but DOES not boot from C. That's holding C at the startup. 

SO Utterly useless if you can't install.

Possibly the corrupt aspect mentioned. DO NOT bother with this, was a waste of time, and works only on a VERY limited range of machines.   "
