Thanks"

,suppe_pose,2005-04-09T00:14Z,"I've been on 99,9% for several hours. what's wrong? looking forward to hearing this..."
,markmarkmark,2005-04-09T05:08Z,"When I checked the ""torrent details"" it says that all the tracks are complete but the last track, ""Vega stage"" is at 96%. This is funny sinc e I RIPPED IT MYSELF. Anyone who's stuck at 99.7% or whatever, can you try playing it and see if it works? thanks"

,AbsoluteSteel,2007-04-10T20:32Z,Thanks mate for uploading this torrent. Unfortunately the soundtrucksucks badly. The thing which they did with trucks like Ryu or Guile state is unforigvable. I was hoping for some really nice heavy metal trucks and this is...just sad...
