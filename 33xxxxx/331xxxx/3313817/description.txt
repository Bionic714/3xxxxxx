A dose of nostalgia for us late 20-somethings out there (anyone else besides me?)

Picked this up today on the way home from work and thought I'd give a bit back to the Pirate Bay community after many enjoyable downloads!

I'd guess that the majority of PB users out there are a bit young to remember the joys of tatsumaki-sen-po-kyaku, spinning star kick, right-down-fwd-punch, or the thousand-hand slap. 

Personally speaking SFII was the only game I ever bought for the SNES and it provided YEARS of entertainment and diversion from an otherwise uninspiring youth in early 90s American suburbia. Definitely on the short list for BEST GAMES EVER.
