Thanks.

I was kicked off of lokitorrent for saying, on the night that he died:

That the now DEAD Christopher Reeves AKA Superman, was an elitist, who didn't give a fuck about crippled people, or stem cell research before he went ass over tit and snapped his neck ridding a horse like an arrogant prick, and got what he deserved.  I also commented on how he looked horrible on TV, and looked very similar to how I would imagine Kermit The Frog would look, if he were to be drained white through insanguination, and had HIV.

It was a little known fact, that Loki, the owner of Lokitorrent, was a NURSE IRL, and also a homosexual, who eventually decided it was somehow better for his tracker, to allow the IP I was using at that time to remain banned.
He was really hurt by the HIV comment apparently.

I was Kicked off Crazy Mazies because I called a moderator a cunt, because she censored one of my posts in the forum, where I was describing my time in prison, and the things that went on there.  In particular, I was describing, how rapes don't really happen as they do in the movies, but how the non-white races have specific names for their homosexual concubines, and are the only races that rape...and that they only rape their own race.  I went into detail about a rape I witnessed, and was booted, EVEN AFTER I DONATED.  Kind of odd for a HORROR/GORE tracker don't you think?  Where every other movie is NAZI EXPERIMENT CAMP, GANG RAPE GRANDPA, etc.

Basically, they used that as an excuse to boot me, because they didn't like my name or politics, which I never brought to the forum in the first place.

After that, I had Macie (the co-sysop) delete all of my torrents.  Why allow people to get my shit, if they are going to be censoring elitists?

I never got my money back either.

Maccie is a Norwegian, so perhaps one of you friendly sweds can ask him in his native tongue, where the fuck my  fucking money is, at:

maccie@msn.com

or

maccie@quakeworld.no

I'll upload Dead Alive tonight."
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-20T03:22Z,"Oh yeah, I also forgot to mention.

I was banned from suprnova.org FORUMS, for pointing out, that at LEAST one of the moderaters was selling IP information to the MPAA and RIAA, yet they LET ME keep using the tracker.  In other words: You found us out, but keep uploading, we like your shit.

Anyone that's ever been caught, was caught on suprnova.org, including myself, well rather the owners of the wi-fi router I was borrowing at the time.  They were all narcs..."
,mighty.penis,2005-04-20T13:00Z,"Hi Sickboy..

You uploading a movie is a guarantee that 1) the movie is good (at least), and 2) the quality is great (did you say XviD?).

I didn't know about the Suprnova folks selling ip-addresses of the uploaders; if it's true I'm glad they were shut down.

Tell Macy at CM to ""knulla seg selv"" (f**k him/herself) :-)

Looking forward to Dead Alive, but could you please seed Heathers a while before that? At the moment it's a complete halt...

Regards,

 M.P."
[T],sickboy88,2005-07-17T11:05Z,Your comments are viciously retarded.
,hopedenial,2005-07-21T03:14Z,"If you enjoy the brat pack movies you're bound to enjoy this movie as well? What kind of retarded logic is that? Those movies, although great, have absolutely nothing in common with heathers. Heathers is demented and twisted, it's not some fucking teen drama starring judd nelson. That's like saying if you like donnie darko youll love shes all that. One is though provoking while the other is mind numbing. I like your taste in movies, but you are kind of a fucking idiot."
,hopedenial,2005-07-21T03:16Z,"Oh, one more thing. Cry me a river you whiny bitch. No one gives a shit."
