,noc38mustang,2006-09-23T07:15Z,"These video files... are they pretty good quality? Not picky or anything, just curious. :)"
,overlydiatonic,2007-12-21T10:08Z,"Yeah, they are fine quality DVD rips, if the Season 1 from the same poster is any indication."

,CrouZ,2008-01-22T22:24Z,FALSE ALARM. I hadn't configured my torrent client after reinstalling windows so I was looking at an incomplete download.
,2k3autococker,2008-03-03T03:52Z,SEED! It's going so so slow!
