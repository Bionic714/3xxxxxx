,ultrabeat,2005-04-22T17:43Z,"Hmm... The there was something wrong with the first track so I downloaded another one, I must have mixed them upp.

Sorry."
,roonster,2005-04-30T14:57Z,"for someone to make a fuckup....easily done.
but for some to copy that fuckup and put said 
fuckup back on here ...claiming to have fixed 
the original fuckup.....pretty darn careless.
wouldnt mind if it was any one of the other songs on there...but who are you?.....fuckidyfuckfuckup!"

,painlasombra,2007-03-29T18:22Z,"First file still dosen't work.
If it's from a cd i think that the cd is broken or scratched.

,dodsy2008,2008-04-24T22:07Z,"Many thanks to the the uploader, but yeah....the first track is corrupt. Here's a link to the full 6min 'uncorrupt' file, which I think is the 12""....(twice as long as the OST version). http://www.seekasong.com/download.php?id=9113499&key=8de7bdfb8383c7de0d0dff9d3a71e786"
