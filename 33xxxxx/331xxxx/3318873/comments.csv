,daftpunker23,2008-04-01T03:45Z,Steam is a Gaming Website that you must download to play these games/mods. Go to google and Search Steam it should be the first couple of them. After that just download it make an account which does not cost anything and your set.
,NonaSuomi,2008-04-09T01:27Z,"Wow, daft. Just wow. ""Steam is a website..."" Yeah, 'cause we've all downloaded the ENTIRE STEAM SITE before... ""to play these games/mods..."" And if we were willing to pay for them, would we REALLY be here? ""It does not cost anything..."" GMod 10 DEFINITELY costs something, because last I checked 9.95 USD != 0.00 USD... Really though, if you can afford the cost of an internet connection's monthly charge, why can't any of you retards yelling ""SEED PLZ"" fork out 10 measly bucks for a file that you'll be waiting on for 2 weeks?"
