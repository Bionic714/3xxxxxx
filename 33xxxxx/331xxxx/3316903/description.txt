Acclaimed as the next Roller Coaster in Korea, pop duo Loveholic comes up with their sophomore album titled Invisible Things. 
Loveholic began to rock the Korean music industry with their debut Florist released in April 2003, offering a sweet flavor of pop rock. The second album of the pop duo is expected to be in the spotlight. While higher expectation is placed over the duo, they also challenge themselves to reach a more sophisticated sound in their latest offering. Title song Sky is a ballad while rock tune Blue 923 offers a powerful modern melody. Also check out sweet and mellow tunes like Kiss Me, Hold Me and Like a Fairy Tale (track 7), and a cool song with a bossa nova taste My Dear.
