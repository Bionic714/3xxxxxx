For top quality, make sure you use the XviD decoder configerator, and turn 
on (Y) and (UV) deblocking, and the new feature of 
XviD 1.1.0 (Y) and (UV) DERINGING.

If you have a slow computer, please turn off pre-processing. I don't want 
another stupid motherfucker telling me that my movies are out of sync 
because they are totally computer illiterate.
