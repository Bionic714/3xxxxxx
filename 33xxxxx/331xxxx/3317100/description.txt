 ³  we don't recommend trying at home, except if you know what youre doing: ³
 ³  You can remove the spinning disc for one second while it's playing a    ³
 ³  movie or loading data. This will trigger some serious read error with   ³
 ³  any other BIOS :-) Now put the disc back in quickly and it will         ³

 ³   - If you want to use full-size DVD-R you can remove the top of the     ³
 ³     console. Team Xtender will be releasing replacement lids compatible  ³
 ³     with full DVD-R within two week. Best of all, we learned this week   ³
 ³     that they will be officially Viper GC branded!                       ³
 ³                                                                          ³
 ³   - Flash the Viper GC with this BIOS then remove the parallel port      ³
 ³     connector from the programmer. If you prefear you can flash this     ³
 ³     BIOS from DVD if you have Cobra 0.3+ already running on your chip.   ³
 ³     We've heard Viper Team will release an USB programmer for the chip   ³
 ³     soon if you prefear USB.                                             ³

 ³   - Turn on your GC with the disc you want to run. It can be an          ³ 
 ³     original or a backup, but if it's a backup it should be filled with  ³ 
 ³     1.3GB of data at least (for now). If you have a black screen coming, ³
 ³     it's probably beause your Viper installation is not clean.           ³

 ³        - Hold Y to go to Main Menu (if it's not your Default Boot mode)  ³
 ³        - Hold X for the other boot mode (can be set in Config Menu)      ³
 ³        - Don't hold anything for Default Boot Action                     ³
 ³                                                                          ³
 ³   - Select "Direct Disc Boot" if you want to play a backup or homebrew   ³
 ³     program from DVD. If you have problems using the Direct Disc Boot    ³ 
 ³     method with your media, you can still use the Swap trick.            ³
 ³                                                                          ³
 ³   - If you want to use the old Swap Trick Method (for discs that are     ³
 ³     not full or that have problems to sync with the Direct Disc Boot)    ³
 ³     boot your GC with an original disc. Then choose the "Change Disc"    ³
 ³     option and follow the instructions. After the swap is done, you      ³
 ³     can select Direct Disc Boot option again.                            ³ 
 ³                                                                          ³
 ³   - Select "Original BIOS" if you want to play an original Game          ³
 ³     compatible with your GC region, or if you want to go into the        ³
 ³     Original BIOS menus.                                                 ³

 ³   - Select "Configuration Menu" if you want to change your Cobra BIOS    ³
 ³     configuration. The options are quite self-explanatory.               ³
 ³                                                                          ³

 ³  The GC drive in its default state only eats high-quality DVD-R and      ³
 ³  a few MINI-DVD-R. But a couple of weeks ago, speedi from the afterdawn  ³
 ³  forums found a nice way to tweak the laser so it reads almost any burned³
 ³  media including some DVD+Rs. We recommend doing this laser tweak if you ³
 ³  have any problems reading your DVDs. We are no laser experts, in fact   ³
 ³  we think it would be more appropriate to just lower the value of the    ³
 ³  variable resistor instead of setting it to an absoulte given value,     ³
 ³  but lots of people including us have been using this laser tweek for a  ³
 ³  couple of weeks without any problem reported so far. For more info on   ³

 ³  - If the disc stops spinning in the menu it means that the drive can't  ³
 ³    sync with your media, or that there are not enough data on your disc. ³
 ³    In direct boot mode the GC is very selective about the media it       ³
 ³    takes. If you have any problem please try the swap trick. If you      ³
 ³    still have problems try with different media/burner. Make sure your   ³
 ³    laser is correctly tweaked! We strongly recommend NEC burners, they   ³
 ³    produce really good discs that won't give you any DRE.                ³
 ³                                                                          ³
 ³  - Audio Streaming: Some games use a special audio streaming mode        ³
 ³    that can be compared to CDDA. For now, the ISO of the file needs to   ³
 ³    be patched with 0rbital's great ViperTemporaryAudioFix 1.1+. If the   ³
 ³    ISO is not patched you'll have noise instead of music. We will try to ³
 ³    fix this issue so no patching is required. But in case we do, YOUR    ³
 ³    PATCHED ISOS WILL BE FULLY COMPATIBLE and still work with music!      ³
 ³    (so forget what is written in the fixer nfo file). Don't run the fix  ³
 ³    on ISOs that don't need fixing as it will only destroy them :-)       ³
 ³                                                                          ³
 ³  - Most multi-discs games are working, just play with Disc 1 until       ³
 ³    you're asked to change disc and make a save here. Then boot with      ³
 ³    Disc 2 instead. We started working on code to allow disc-change,      ³
 ³    and we'll integrate it in a new release.                              ³

 ³  All those problems could be fixed in a next update.                     ³

 ³  Before burning an image, makes sure it is 1459978240 bytes long else    ³
 ³  you may need to use the swap trick method.                              ³

 ³  To know what's your GC Version code (2 digit number) go into Config     ³
 ³  Menu, then Version Info, 2nd page. First digit corresponds to GC        ³
 ³  mobo version, 2nd digit corresponds to drive version.                   ³
 ³                                                                          ³
 ³  IF YOU MAKE BACKUPS, DON'T USE ANY "WIPE" TOOLS TO SAVE SPACE. Unless   ³
 ³  you know it's REALLY working. Most of thoses tools only work because    ³
 ³  the current pso loaders patch libraries routines to emulate DVD. But    ³
 ³  on REAL HARDWARE, each file/fst has to be aligned on a 4-byte boundary! ³
 ³  Else nothing will work. Audio Files (for audio streaming) even need     ³
 ³  to be aligned on a 32kb-boundary ! So forget current "WIPE" tools until ³
 ³  they are fixed. But note that Garbage is NOT NEEDED by the GC. The      ³
 ³  files must be correctly aligned that's it. So if your "WIPE" tool is    ³
 ³  not changing the image size (meaning there's no relocation) then it's   ³
 ³  probably fine. Use FSTFIX by LOONYCUBE to fix bad rips.                 ³

 ³  We'll release a command-line MultiBoot Disc maker next week if nobody   ³
 ³  releases a better one before we do :-) Here are the specs for Multiboot ³
 ³  discs. Note that every image should be aligned on a 32kb boundary.      ³

 ³  The MultiBoot feature is stealth for the GC so it's 100% compatible     ³
 ³  with homebrew images. If you want to put several backups on one disc    ³
 ³  you'll have to remove the garbage at first.                             ³
 ³  The maximum size of a MultiBoot disc is 1459978240 bytes.               ³
