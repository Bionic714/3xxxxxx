Is it with AC3 Sound?
Is it DivX or Xvid?
What bitrate does the video, and audio have?

Those are things you need to put in description...
Don't take this the wrong way, I'm just trying to guide you. The realeses you put out are great. But really, is this Fullscreen or what?

Second of all... As *yuip* pointed out, Chapter 20 (Touched) is cut...

What happened there????

Can it be fixed?"
,Joe_Dude,2011-10-01T05:10Z,"I only have the first two done and I decided to check them because season six was messed up. This one appears to be the same way with the audio out of sync. I'm fairly sure that its not just my download either because I re-downloaded season six and its still the same way. Either way thanks for the uploads. Seasons 1-5 worked perfectly, I have no idea what could be the problem with these last two seasons. If anybody reads this and knows of a better download for six and seven then let me know. Thanks again Johosc, I'm sure its something on my end causing the problem."
,You_Muppet,2012-04-08T15:45Z,"Yep, it's your end, dude. Sound, picture & sync are all fine. Ta"
,yosafbridge78,2012-06-29T07:08Z,"Episode 20 ""Touched"" has the sex scenes cut from it. 

When did PirateBay become prudish? 

Other than that it's a good torrent..."
