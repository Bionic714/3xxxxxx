Im seeding these albums that i've found on soulseek.
I know how hard it is to find these on Swedish trackers, cos i've searched myself.

So don't give me crap about different bitrate. I'll try to be as specific i can in my description.

This torrent contains these albums by the Japanese group
"Thee Michelle Gun Elephant"

- Last Heaven's bootleg (live 2cd) [192kbps]
- 1996 Cult grass stars [192kbps]
- 1997 Chicken zombies [different rips]
- 1998 Gear blues [128-320kbps]
- 1999 Rumble [different rips, some 192 some 128]
- 2000 Casanova snake (usa edition) [256kbps]
- 2001 Rodeo tandem beat specter [various]
- 2003 Sabrina heaven [128kbps]

I've also tooken the liberty of throwing in some songs i didn't really know where to put. and some albums covers.

I'll hope you'll enjoy it!
