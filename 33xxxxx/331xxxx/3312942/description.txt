Union Carbide Productions.
In short a swedish band, (Gothenburg) who  later transformed in to Soundtrack of our lifes, with members from Nymphet Noodlers, another swedish band, (Karlstad) who is worth checking out.
This U.C.P. Album "From influence to ignorance" was released 1991.
I included a bonus track with The Jan Martens Frustration "Convolutions" from his first eponymous EP. (Jan Martens was the bassplayer with Nymphet Noodlers.)

Enjoy!
P.S. Hey DJ, don't play mp3's if you're getting paid, that's cheap and it sounds baaad on strong volume! D.S. :)
