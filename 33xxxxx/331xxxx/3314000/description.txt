This course introduces the tale of Rome’s rise and decline. In the restless and fragmented history of Europe, the Roman Empire stands unmatched as a monument to unity, scale, and stability. 

From pre-Roman Italy through the long centuries of Republican and then Imperial rule, Professor Fagan interweaves narrative and analysis. Chronologically, the focus is the years 200 B.C. to 200 A.D., when Roman power was at its height. 

Thematically, the course also examines the status of women and the family, the lot of slaves, Roman cities and religious customs, the ubiquitous and beloved institution of public bathing, the deep cultural impact of Hellenism, and such famous Roman amusements as chariot racing and gladiatorial games.
