This is the same F-22 Lightning 3, one of the most famous Air Combat sims of all times. Came out in 1998 and still is considered a great game. There still many guys playing in the multiplayer mode so you will have loads of fun when playing online. 

The game is already updated and cracked all you need to do is run it and you can play missions or online. The only difference between this and a regular version is there is no music and no introductory video. There are regular sounds though like the engine and stuff. 

Enjoy

PS: If you can please upload it on multiple trackers/bit torrent websites. You can use bitlord of bitcomet to add or edit the tracker list.
