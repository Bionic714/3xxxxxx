,opopanax,2006-08-13T20:56Z,"hey Ardinia, thanx for this great stuff. just wanted to say i found glitches on some of the tracks. 
like the 3rd track of City is completely fucked - can't even hear the drum intro, the next track, and 2nd track on SYL also has glitches."
,opopanax,2006-08-13T20:57Z,"
           and SYL sounds so dull. does it sound clear on Cd? i cant hear the snare drums, the 
guitars r loud but everything else is just drowned in it. is this an encoding problem or the 
production? 
               i rechecked these tracks by dloading them again, but the problem is there. please check these tracks, ok."
,Ardinia,2006-11-03T04:06Z,"SYL is the original release, there has since been a remastered version release, but i have not bought it yet"
