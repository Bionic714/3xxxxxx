A wonderful debut album from the Polish outfit Skalpel. They are certainly more than adept at what they do; their seamless blend of dusty 50s and 60s Polish jazz records is technically flawless and their subdued, dramatic compositions are stirring. With a reverence for fantasy basement jam sessions processed through a funky breaks blender to yield a sonic frappe both thoroughly modern and strangely reminiscent, something almost completely subliminal.

Smoky late night laid back jazz with horns, conga's, flutes, double bass, moody 70's soundtrack ambience, and held together with coldcut-esque found voices, making the album come over like a soundtrack to a lost episode of the Twighlight Hour.
