NYC, January 2001 on release of his newest book A Different Kind of Teacher, where this award-winning school teacher exposes the problems inside America's school system. Gatto takes a hard look at the fundamental causes of the Columbine massacre where students shot several others studentsin cold blood, a theme which seems now to be occuring on a daily basis in America. He goes beyond the media critique which blames the event on everything but the nature of schooling. Find out what is wrong with America's school system from an expert who has seen it and studied it in detail. 2h long. A must see for everyone."
