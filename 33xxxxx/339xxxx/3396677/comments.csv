Really been looking forward to this, hoping more people will find it possible to seed some more - It'd be nice to download it fast, as I'm kinda waiting to get it."
,epf04lepe,2006-11-01T00:32Z,anyone still seeding this?
,mr_spatula,2007-01-23T19:45Z,"please someone seed, i migrated to a new laptop in the middle if this book and lost it!"

Personally, I hate having to rewind/search for the spot where I dozed off last night when one track is like 10 hours long. A lot of us audiobook lovers listen to theirs on an MP3 player (etc), instead of sitting on the computer.

Thanks for the effort anyhow, finalstandfinalstand."
