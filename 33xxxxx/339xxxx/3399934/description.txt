yoyo

if u have problems playin this movie on standalone players

use this semi-patch

strip movie in file movie and overwrite the files in the VIDEO_TS folder with these files
and remake the img with ImgTools and burn...

Any are welcome to do a PFF patch but the n00b makin this didnt know how ;)



PS: but we all know out friends at DNA is gonna do a nice 5.1/DTS rls of this
    which is fine cuz the bitrate of this were over 7000kbit :)
