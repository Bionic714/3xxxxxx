This is a small pack containing the following VSTs:


Camel Audio CamelSpace VST v1.10
Maxx.Claster.Toxic.VSTi.v2.1-BEAT
Rob.Papen.Blue.VSTi.v1.01-h2O
Superwave.Bundle.VSTi.v2.0-h2O
WWAYM.NWSynth.VSTi.v1.3-BEAT

I thought those were great after having tried them out for a while, so I share them with all other fellow pirate musicians *yaaarrrrr!* =)

Instructions:

To install, unrar the chosen instrument, start the installer and follow the instructions. CamelSpace hasn't got an installer, so just unrar it to your VST folder  and you're ready to go.

Pls write a comment if you like the stuff, and help to seed :)
