Israel's finest Dark Soho present another masterpiece full of emotion and energy with Combustion,

The second studio album since the highly acclaimed debut 'Sunspot'. Deep, dark and brooding, Combustion's dose of atmospheric synths, driving rhythms and melancholic metal riffs, combine to create a spontaneous explosive reaction.

Featuring nine tracks with an exclusive bonus Quicktime video of Uring Saracom live, Combustion is a truly stunning and full power frontal assault of the seven senses. Dark Soho once again delivers to the dance floors a nerve-shattering album that literally tears apart the boundaries of the psychedelic trance genre.

With extensive releases on psytrance compilations on Alchemy, Sphere and Hom-mega Records, Dark Soho have a reputation for ecstatic and energetic live shows which stand out next to many other live trance acts with their ultra heavy guitar laden riffs and symphonic sound on stage.
