I thought I should just upload this, it's a small 30 minutes lecture by Howard Lederer, which I extracted from the (rather large) movie found here:

http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3390355

He talks about 7 key concepts of improving your poker game:

Honesty
Forgiveness
Balance
Style
Relaxation
Focus
Observation


So go ahead - download it and transfer it to your iPod and listen to it 24-7! :)
