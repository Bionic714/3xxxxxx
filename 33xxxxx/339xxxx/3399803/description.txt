The focus shifts back to Chicken (Jordan Chan) in this latest installment of the Young and Dangerous series. Roy Cheung returns as an evil triad from long-time Hung Hing rival - Tung Sing Society. He begins by killing Dinosaur, the branch leader of the Tuen Mun area, which opens up a vacancy in the Hung Hing board of directors, with both Chicken (Jordan Chan) and Dinosaur's ruthless right-hand man, Barbarian, nominated for the job. Without spoiling any plots from Part III, Mr. Cheung?s (Hung Hing?s Godfather played by Simon Yam) younger brother (played with finesse by Alex Man) is persuaded to take over the society. Deciding to split Tuen Man in half for two months and see who runs their half better, Chicken and Barbarian both fight all out for the seat!(Summary from Aznfilms.com)
