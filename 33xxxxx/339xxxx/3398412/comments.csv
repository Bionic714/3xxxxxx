Gå til http://m0005.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_blitzkrieg_2.shtml

Last ned siste oppdatering til spillet og installer denne. Last så ned cracken på samme sted."

,NicLoader,2008-12-07T20:03Z,How do i install from disc 4? Do i have to burn it?
,CakeMonster,2008-12-30T16:50Z,"I got it to work

I used winrar on the files and extracted them just fine

I then mounted the first cd with Deamon tools and the auto run came up, since I use vista it took a very long time for the install to start but once it did everything went fine with all cds, just unmount and mount the cd which is required by the install to make it clear I had no problem what so ever with cd 4 or cd 3 or cd 2 or cd 1

I then downloaded the 1.05 version from the link above or you can go directly to the game makers home page

I did NOT need to use the nocd patch and I did not need the serial which comes in the install files

Idid this all today and have played the first turtorial mission which is basically move some tanks from here to there and kill some enemy vehicles and call for reinforcments"
,weaselciuy,2009-01-27T01:19Z,"i hope this works ...

,major9211,2010-05-16T06:16Z,"The game works.

1.you must have to use win rar.
2.extract all cds and install the game with demon tool.
3.after install starforce will restart your system.
4.now again mount cd 1.
5.star force will show some error.
6.mount cd 1 again.
7.just click reinstall.
8.it will ask all the cds .
9.be connected to internet.
10.the game will auto update.
11.it will take a long time but after that game will work from the desktop icon.
