-TAGLINE-
	Stand back. Jim Kelly's out to kick the mob where it hurts.

-WHAT THE BACK OF THE CASE SAYS-
	Might as well be the entire fucking script.
	"When you're clever, strong, handsome, a smooth talker, and a master of the martial arts, you're like no one else in Hollywood. You're Jim Kelly, former International Middleweight Karate Champion, who made....blah blah blah"

-WHAT REALLY HAPPENS-
	Black Belt Jones, a funky karate champian takes on the mob that tries to take over a black karate school because it's on important land. Funkiness and ass-kicking ensue.

-Notes-
'That black guy from Enter the Dragon' displays his skills all the while keeping that smile that the ladies love. He punches an insane amount of scrotums, leads a group of foxy secret agent babes (with trampoline skills to boot!), and leads a car chase into a malfunctioning car wash. This all ends with a spectacular final battle that simply must be seen to be believed!

Unfortunately, as with the last release, this tape has been watched so many times that the audio fades in and out of existence. I did my best to bring up the soft parts and normalize the whole thing, so its still better than the original tape, but not great. But this movie is just too fantastic not to release!
Don't know if this will ever be released on DVD. The 'sequels' have been, but this is a classic that hopefully someone will turn out with love.
