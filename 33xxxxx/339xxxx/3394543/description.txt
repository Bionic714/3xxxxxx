DVD-Cloner is a super easy tool to copy DVDs to DVD-R/RW. DVD Cloner 2 makes backing up your copy-protected DVD movies simple. With your DVD burner and DVD Cloner software, you pop in the DVD you want to copy in your DVD-ROM and a blank DVD in your DVD Burner and click the button to start the DVD burning process. You can clone your DVD entirely within 2-3 hours, in the same quality as the original. The cloned DVD can be played in any compatible DVD Player. Plus, DVD Cloner 2 is one of the few DVD backup software titles that has a built-in CSS/DVD Ripper. You do not need to download a separate program like DVD43 or AnyDVD.
