Comment:
Took me some while to find a complete set of good looking covers for this quadrilogy of great movies. Well, there's actually 5 parts, since it comes with a bonus disc. Didn't like the idea of having 5 different looking covers sitting on the shelf. But now I got these 5 nice looking covers sitting on my shelf. Great job TRD.
