,Buff44,2007-08-25T13:03Z,"I can't see any files when I open the ISO file. Does anyone else have this problem and is there a way to solve it? 
"
,Buff44,2007-08-25T23:37Z,"Ah, I've got it. It doesn't work just mounting the file with deamon tool. I had to use Qwix in order to extract the iso file, and now I can copy the folders to my xbox. 

Have a good day!"
