And work with newer nvidia drivers like 171.16.

In the description says that ""uninstall any versions of The Chronicles of Riddick Escape from Butcher Bay before you use this update"".
But the path is:
1.install the Chronicles of Riddick without applying any  patch/crack (not included here)
2.install the patch (included)
3.Copy the files from the VITALITY dir into game dir (included)"

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4289444/The_Chronicles_of_Riddick__escape_from_butcher_bay_Patch_and_Cra

follow all of the directions and it will work for you like it did for me.

i was actually going to repack and reupload the iso but my uplaod sucks to much to do that.

oh, and this game doesn't have any trojans in it(false positive most likely)

well whatever, i won't be complaining if you guys don't download my torrent :shrugs: less wasted bandwith on my part :D "
