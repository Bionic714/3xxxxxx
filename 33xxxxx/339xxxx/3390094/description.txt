A lot of people have been having problems with the opengl 1.3 and sse error in riddick. I download a few files and got it working with nvidia 78.01 driver suite. make sure you uninstall any versions of The Chronicles of Riddick Escape from Butcher Bay before you use this update. Note this patch is designed for the English (EU) version not the US version (EN)  worx for me......
