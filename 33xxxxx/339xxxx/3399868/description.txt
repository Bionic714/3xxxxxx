Dimensions of dialogue by Jan Svankmajer (1982)

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084362/

A three-part depiction of various forms of communication. 'Exhaustive Discussion' depicts three heads (made up of fruit, kitchen utensils and writing implements respectively) endlessly devouring and regurgitating each other. 'Passionate Discourse' shows two clay figures romantically intertwined, and the problems with dealing with the end product of their passion, while 'Factual Conversation' shows two animated heads playing a bizarre variant of the old scissors-paper-stone game
