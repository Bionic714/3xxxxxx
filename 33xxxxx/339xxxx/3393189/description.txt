l'age d'or by Luis BuÃ±uel
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021577/
English subtitles included

This rip is taken from the BFI release, see above link.
The quality of their print is not so bad.
(ill upload un chien andalou when this is seeded, they are just under 700megs together, and I apologise in advance for my slow upload speed, 11k, but it will be running nonstop)

This is my first attempt at subtitles, if anything is wrong with them let me know and I will try redoing them.

Also I think you all should know that ive knocked up a website: 

it has a list of all the films released here so far, and a link to a message board, I don?t know if anyone will be interested in using it, but ive found it quite useful when trying to keep track of what films have been put up here and what else should be made available to us all, maybe some of you will find it useful too.
