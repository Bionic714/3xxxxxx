,Leekuan,2006-04-29T16:43Z,"Am I the only one who doesn't get sound ?? Any other movie works fine here, but this one is completely silent for me. There should be some music, as I understand.
The player (xine) says it has ffmpeg 2 channel audio, 48 kHz. But what I get is just silence."
,stu,2006-05-01T00:43Z,your probably missing the DivX WMAv2 codec.
,Leekuan,2006-05-05T16:56Z,"I get it in other movies.
Tried Mplayer; and it complains about some 'file descriptor'; then some ""pcm audio: pcm ..."" and fails to play altogether.
I tried again with the torrent (btorrent), and it checks the files and states 'download succeeded'.

I'm out of any further clue here.
Maybe I should still try to download again ?

Would anyone have MD%sum for a proper working (inclusive audio) file ?"

,goonmama,2008-12-07T16:34Z,"As Leekuan mentioned, the audio here will not play for everyone. I have a mac and have not been able to play wmav2 audio files. I've tried downloading a lot of codecs and flip4mac, but nothing seems to work. Any suggestions? Also, thanks for the upload, just wish I had sound"
