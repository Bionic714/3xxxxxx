,sztockmann,2007-05-25T13:15Z,"unsui, you are completely and utterly wrong. 'The Drift' is a fantastic album.  Whilst it is not a very accessible piece and demands complete concentration and a willingness to be challenged, I would argue that this is one experimental album with which it is well worth putting in the effort.  'The Drift' may not be easy listening, but the breadth of emotion and pain conveyed in each track is breathtakingly eloquent, poignant and beautiful.  It is also genuinely original and despite its raw delivery, tracks like 'the escape', 'a lover loves' and 'cossacks are' are structurally sophisticated.  This music is undoubtedly uncanny and intended to be disturbing.  It might not be 'enjoyable' in the same way as sugary pop music is supposed to be, but as a work of art it is unmatched in the last couple of years.  I will try to up 'The Drift' this week if I get time.
Thanks to the upper for these albums!"

,bandwagon,2008-12-13T09:37Z,"PLEASE...I want THE DRIFT!

Many Thanks to johnny_cash, anyway!"

,Dr.Octo,2009-02-03T07:48Z,FUCK YEAH!!!!!!
,vitanuova,2010-07-02T22:12Z,"Yeah, I'm replying to a comment that's over three years old, but for fuck's sake, The Drift is the best album of the past twenty years and will be remembered long after history has forgotten about Led Zeppelin and The Beatles."
,Xeokym,2012-05-28T15:54Z,I found out about this guy from Futurama LOL
