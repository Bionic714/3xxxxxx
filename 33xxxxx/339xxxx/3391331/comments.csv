,DJWarlok,2007-11-24T20:11Z,"hey deelee, thanks for the awesome torrent, just to let you know vol 1 part of 2 vol 3 and vol 48 don't work with itunes, you still had alot of stuff mislabeled vol 6 is actually the BEAT FREAK cd not the plain super eurobeat vol 6 and the bonus cd you have with vol 30 is actually just vol34 other than having to rename at least 15 albums and thos not working it's a great torrent, thank you very much, i'm off to see if i can reencode the non working ones and get them to work with itunes (they play in winamp)"
