,MHickman86,2006-11-16T09:20Z,How do i play the Bin file?
,asmariamoon,2007-02-27T05:48Z,"you need a PSX emulator, such as ePSXe, that can read from .iso or .bin files"
,pbransford,2007-03-01T01:34Z,"Once again, someone clulessly zips/rars CD images... in a torrent.

This is bad for two reasons:

ISO IMAGES ARE NOT COMPRESSION FRIENDLY
(waste of author's time, and downloader's)

YOU CAN'T PICK AND CHOOSE FILES IN A TORRENT TO DOWNLOAD IF IT'S ARCHIVED!


Next time, just put em in a folder and make a torrent for the folder."
,Shnoky,2007-05-20T03:32Z,"Thanks Frezzno, Ive been looking for this classic game for years. for compression try 7z next time its better than rar. it can compress upto 90% of its original size. "
,Shnoky,2007-05-20T03:34Z,"and its also good to use bin,cue. easy to mount using daemon tools. Pbransford ... Fuck you cock sucker."
,mikeysama,2007-08-14T02:46Z,"I agree with pbransford for the most part. Rar'ong the ISOs together is a mistake, and generally the compression isn't worth it. Shnoky brings up a good point with 7zip, but needs to chill the fuck out. The best thing would be to 7zip the ISOs separately, giving each disk its own archive, that way everyone is happy."

,OldSchooler,2008-10-09T02:32Z,"Thanx frezzno for this wonderfull turrent! STOP BITCHING ON A WORKING ""FREE"" PSX TURRENT, IF YOU DONT LIKE COMPRESSED FILES, THEN DONT DL THIS AND PAY 20 DOLLARS FOR THE GAME! THIS TURRENT WORKS BE HAPPY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,noumuon,2008-10-23T01:55Z,"raring and psx ISOs go together hand in hand. the compression is well worth it. 40-60% depending on the game. they should be archived individually as it's more convenient, but all game ISOs should be rared. i mean, 4 CDs and the size is 1.08 gigs. if you don't like it, stfu, don't download and go cry to your mom."
,S0ulReaver_90,2008-11-28T15:18Z,"I've been looking for this game converted to PSX format for quite a while. Thank you kindly for it.
