My personal favorite PSX game (when I played it 4 years ago). This package is ripped by someone else. Lucky is that because I only found 1 disc from my original collection, and that's really no point in upload only one disc. But it works.

PCSXBOX configurations:
Nah, I can't remember the exact config but I tested it once and it worked. Just keep these points in mind.

* Turn off all graphic filterings.
* Set throttering to no keys.
* Try with BIOS.
* Turn of auto load last save state.
* Check this link http://forums.xbox-scene.com/index.php?showtopic=238506 to see how others did.

- PSX - PCSXBOX ------------------------------------------
Playing PSX games on xbox is not only cool, it's also fun
and pleasent. Sometimes it's even better than playing on a
real Playstation. That is if you got the game to actually
work, which seems to be a difficult task. Because of that
few will choose to play PSX on the Xbox and a game will be
hard to find, as it already is. The Xbox community is big
and by introducing the PSX there a dying race might rise
again, or at least not be forgotten. And others, both old
and new, will have a chance to enjoy what once ruled the
earth. Please help this community by putting this entire
tag in your torrent description along with details of
Pcsxbox configuration for the game. By having this tag a
game will surely work on the Xbox when making a search on
PCSXBOX. While making a simple search on PSX others can
enjoy it on other systems as well.
