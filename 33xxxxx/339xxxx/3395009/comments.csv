,nath042,2006-10-21T13:50Z,All of u needing keys go to www.serials.ws but use firefox cos if u use windows it gives u viruses! 
,Panodilo,2006-10-31T09:51Z,asmara is right. I just set my clock back to 2003 and Premiere works like a charm. It's a beatiful program and I can totally live with the clock glitch. See you at the Rasberry Awards...
,nuF Novak,2006-11-22T23:39Z,i sure hope oceanofdarkstars is joking....please seed
,bluesskyflyer,2007-01-26T10:58Z,"Avid Xpress pro does work (maybe) but needs SP2 and still has the asd mixer error on my laptop?  Install software. Copy the 9mb small file from the Pantheon directory into the programme replacing the 15 meg? one.  It will now fire up without a dongle.  Like I say though, it still had the ad? sound error and wouldn't work.
Use the free version?"
,snapdragon470,2007-02-10T16:52Z,"Very nice collection, as far as I can see. Could someone else seed it, because the download situation is useless at the moment"
,nessboy,2007-07-08T15:21Z,how do I innstall a program?
,bagge1man,2007-07-23T11:08Z,i cannot believe it........17568 downloaders and 21 seeders...... you can't be serious.  some of you people are just greedy bastards....
[V],RadioActiveWeasel,2007-08-15T18:10Z,"uhhh actually its 14 seeders and 32 downloaders(leechers) 

what you were looking at is the amount of people that have already downloaded. notice the times after the big number?

so try not to make a fool of your self."
,barbaruiva,2008-01-07T17:44Z,"Two of the files in this package were caught as Trojan Horses by my AVG uptodate anti-virus. 
    The files are: 
Clonedvd2.0.7.3.zip and keygen.exe

I am sure it was not the intention of Detmach to send us a Trojan horse, but sometimes shit happens. 

The other softwares are great. Thanks!"
,holy07,2008-01-19T05:38Z,"looks like good package...

but, 0.1kb/s

dont be so greedy ppl, seed it."
,000Rasmus,2008-02-23T09:44Z,seed ffs!!...
,Puny Human,2008-04-07T05:45Z,"AVG Anti-virus (free version) reports that the file keygen.exe within ADOBE PREMIER PRO 7 w Ebooks.rar is infected with Trojan horse Delf.chk

AVG Anitvirus also reports that  clonedvd.2.0.7.3.keygen-tsrh.exe within the file clonedvd.2.0.7.3.zip is infected with Trojan Horse Generic8.lbv

McAfee reports no threats in any of these files. 

I wouldn't use either of those keygens but I'm going to continue seeding this because there are a lot of good programs here besides those. 


"
,JOKER767,2008-06-01T16:04Z,"OK: The file is super and has a great many things that are needed to do most all of your video editing.
BUT>>>>>> There are some Trojans on this pack. Just scan the entire file when finished and you will find at least 4. So just use the ones that don't have Trojans and your good to go. Thanks for the software."
,Krommzm,2008-06-17T17:35Z,"This torrent has been chosen by Krommzm for his project called ""ISeedYou"":

To celebrate my new Line and to help all of those great torrents that has too few seeders I will clean my old computer, and add alot of Torrents that has a good description-filesixe etc... I will add some torrents to uTorrent and some others to Opera Browser's Built-In Bittorrent client.
Once the files are completely downloaded, they will remain uploading for a LONG time..

Enjoy faster download speed on THIS torrent!Note that I will not be checking this torrent for virus, not even opening it...

(Think this is a good thing? Do something similar yourself!)"
,stopimalreadydead,2008-06-28T03:02Z,Why not just download the Avid Xpress Pro 5.8 torrent and maybe Adobe Encore DVD and save yourself having to download all these other programs?
,MaLLinZ,2008-09-06T06:56Z,which one of these programs can directly cut parts of a video .mov file directly without conversion?
,Gerry_A,2008-09-24T03:15Z,"For those using AVG, it frequently gives false virus readings (and dumps it to quarantine), especially with keygens. I got soooo frustrated with it that I dumped it and use a paid copy of ESET Nod32. No more problems."
,Brice3010,2008-12-11T11:17Z,"To Gerry A.: why use a paid copy of NOD32 if you can get it here for free? Download here, test it first, see if you like it, and then buy...  No?"
,esotericx10,2008-12-13T15:17Z,"I haven't downloaded this yet, but I just wanted to point out that often times keygens will generate false positives. However if you can't clean the files don't use them. I'll report back and let you know what I find"
