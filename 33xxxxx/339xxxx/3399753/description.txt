First it was for Xbox, Then it came out on PC, Just a click away. It's Fable.


This download contains a winrar folder which has an image of all 4 CD's and a help file. You'll need a working copy of WinRAR, a computer that doesn't suck (unlike mine) and a disk imaging program like FantomCD. I suggest FantomCD 'cause I've heard that it doesn't work for some other programs and I've never had a problem with it. Just put anything for the installation code, it's been cracked.
