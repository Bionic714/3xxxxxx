,charonn0,2007-03-19T12:56Z,You need to boot from a DOS floppy and use FDISk to set the partition as active before installing DOS
,argus5000,2007-03-21T14:53Z,"When it asks for Disk 1, hit F3 to exit.  At the prompt, type ""fdisk"" and create Primary partition.  You will need to reboot. Again, F3 to exit, then type ""format c:"" .  After another reboot install should work fine."

Here is the correct procedure to install MSDOS 6.22

2. After the machine as booted exit the setup program (F3).
3. Type fdisk and create a partition and make it active.
4. Reboot again with the CD/Floppy/ISO.
5. After the machine as booted exit the setup program (F3).
6. Type format c: /q /s

You can now boot MSDOS from the harddisk."

,seedfo3,2009-12-18T00:54Z,"You kids...

Here's a little howto:
1) Boot up your VM with the MS-DOS ISO loaded.
2) Exit the install (F3 twice)
3) Use ""fdisk"" to create a partition
4) format your newly created C: partition with ""format C:""
5) Reboot and install DOS
6) Change the disk to Windows 3.11
7) Install
8) Enjoy

Thanks, Markild! "
,samljer,2009-12-20T20:38Z,"@ TOTTHS06

your probably long gone considering the time stamp.
But as for windows 1 and 2 they are not windows at all, but a UI program for dos, in dos.
i dont think it even has a kernel. not sure.
but i remember it stayed in dos. basically added a few functions to look at your drive and drivers didnt exist. to some extent"
,seedfo3,2010-02-02T12:03Z,"samljer, you mean back when the CPU was actually central? :) Yes, those were the days! And the OS (DOS) didn't have these background daemons always writing to the disk... And the filesystem was a lot less featured... And the thing booted RIDICULOUSLY quickly and you could just power it off when you were done writing your changes :)

Those were the days! But I still love Windows 7 :)"

,supanut2000,2010-08-18T10:45Z,"How can I make it see my CD?
I tried it and it throw up a bomb and yelled ""Insert disk 1"""
,barkerbob26,2010-09-04T03:50Z,"If you're having trouble with the install of DOS or the copy of windows it's because they're set to install from drive d: 

You also need 2 make a dos partition, a 999mb fat 16 partition, set is as active and it'll install fine. After that, you can dual boot or whatever, right now my lappy boots dos/win31, debian, vista, and osx on just one hd.

If you have more than 1 HD, and more than 1 cdrom, you just need to temporarily unplug them so that your HD is your c: drive and your ONE cd-drive is your d: drive. 

This will fix all the probs I'm reading about here, really an ez fix. 

No reason to run memoryhog dosbox, just install this iso and run all your fav dos games. After you install you can hook your drives back up and everything is fine. 
Enjoy this shit and keep seeding. "
,Outlawed_biker,2010-09-07T19:40Z,"I installed the dos and these drivers work greatly. And after messing with the config.sys to bypass the conventional memory limitations, I managed to install win 3.11 but it always crashes my virtual machine. I also tried another version (Win 3.1). I'm wondering if that's happens because of the drivers included in this torrent mention freedos, but since no one else mentioned this problem, I'm asking for a tip. I'm using the last release of VirtualBox."
,carpii,2011-01-25T02:16Z,"After installing DOS, I had problems getting it to recognise my CDROM under Parallels 5 (mac).

Heres how I fixed it

1) Download the NEC cdrom driver (probably lots of others would work too)
http://www.scarlet.nl/~one2one/s2.html

2) Get it onto your DOS drive somehow (onto root of C drive). 

For this I mounted a virtual floppy drive in another Parallels VM, and copied it from there onto the virtual floppy. Then mounted the virtual floppy in my DOS VM.

3) Add this to autoexec.bat 
MSCDEX.exe /D:cdrom001

4) Add this to CONFIG.SYS
device=nec_ide.sys /D:cdrom001

Reboot, and you now have a D: cdrom. You can then mount the windows ISO and start installing glorious 3.11 :)"

1. Mount MSDos iso.
2. Boot Virtual Machine.
3. Hit F3 twice.
4. Type: 'fdisk' and create a 'primary partition' then exit out.
5. Once at the command line type 'format C:'.
6. Type 'setup'.
