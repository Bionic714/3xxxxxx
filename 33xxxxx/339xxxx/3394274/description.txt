Point one: Pop music is mostly a repetition of two types of musical and lyrical phrases: The verse and the chorus.

Point two: These elements repeat an average of three times in a "top-40" radio hit.

Point three: Cut out the fat and a pop song is only one minute long.

Point four: One minute is also the length of most commercials, and therefore, their corresponding jingles.

Point five: Jingles are the music of America.

Conclusion: This compact disc is terrific in shuffle play. To convert the jingles to pop music, program each song to repeat three times.
