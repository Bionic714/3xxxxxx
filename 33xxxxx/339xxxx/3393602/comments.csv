simply google the word UTORRENT
+you dont have to pay for it-its free"
,floyderrun,2010-02-09T14:19Z,"does this include the extended-solo guitar version of Comfortably Numb or is the same of the official VHS edition ?

if some1 owns the live-broadcasted version (the non edited one!) please upload here THX"
,Hobbit13,2010-04-12T12:24Z,"I have the broadcasted version. ARTE aired it once. It is a recording of the same show, but different camera angles. 

Other versions of the songs only exist in audio, the cd was recorded at a different night as the video.

I will upload it in a few weeks"
