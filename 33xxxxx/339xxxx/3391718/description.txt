These are the reading files and other files associated with Pimsleur's Russian courses. Pimsleur programs are famous for not having much in the way of printed materials -- and not needing them much either... but Cyrillic is a bit different, so ...

Caveat: This came from a huge torrent I came across and downloaded a while back 
(don't remember where), which contained a lot of Pimsleur booklets, scanned as 
images. I haven't verified that these files are a perfect match to the posted
Pimsleur Russian recordings (it may be a different edition--the ones for Italian, 
which I AM studying, were NOT the same edition, but were helpful, nonetheless), 
but perhaps something is better than nothing.

There are also some .hlp files (Windoze help format) which appear to be related 
to learning Russian grammar. I haven't looked at these either (I don't do 
Windoze).

Also included are cover art, though I attached that to each of the MP-3 files, 
too.

Hope you find these a helpful addition to either or any of the Russian lessons 
posted here.

I've archived them as a .tar so you don't end up renaming or deleting files and 
screw up the hash of the original (hopefully this will help with keeping the 
files seeded so it doesn't die out.) I probably won't be checking back often, so 
if the torrent DOES die out, please send me a personal message.

And please DO seed!
