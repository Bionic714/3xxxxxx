,evhwg,2006-01-28T08:09Z,Why dosn't the sound work?
,notarealperson,2006-02-14T00:09Z,"The sound works for me.  I get the occasional tiny glitch, but I'm pretty sure that's because I'm watching it and seeding it at the same time."
,electrohippy,2006-03-24T00:17Z,"The audio likely doesn't work because your DIVX codec is out dated. Get DIVX 6 here:

,SAMF2000,2009-01-07T21:15Z,"A True Classic for anyone who grew up in the 80'S Will really appreciate on so many levels.
 This movie showed the beginnings of the Computer industy, Arcades, Modems and the fear that a highschool kid could hack into this new technology."
,PirateJantje,2011-03-19T17:49Z,You all forget to mention the totally too cute Ally Sheedy. Great movie from the beginning of computers (my youth lol)
