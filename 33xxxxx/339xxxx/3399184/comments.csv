,lootninja,2008-05-22T03:32Z,"Works perfectly, dispite a generic error message after un-stuffit-ing.  key provided in this thread works too.  And yes we are aware this is an older version of office, hence the version name in the title.  Some people have old ass G3's with low ram and stuff like openoffice/neooffice perform too slowly."
,nitrous9200,2008-06-26T17:12Z,Unstuff error at the end but still works fine. Key works fine as well. Runs really fast on my iMac G3 500mhz w/ 384MB RAM.
