Havent seen a good lite xp, so i made one, that im now sharing.

BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD:
1.Download a working browser (i recomend Firefox) or one that isint dependant on ie core.
2.For media functionality i recomend K-lite mega codec pack, and itunes,
3, i also recomend nero, ms word 2k3 pro, all the latest updates, and so on
4. if the key provided dosent work for any reason (worked for me), dont complain, just google summit like "win xp pro corp sp2 serial", you shoulg find one, if it works post it here.
