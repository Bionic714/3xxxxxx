DVD/Divx rip by BLUdRAGON

As far as I know this hasn't yet been released in the west.  I couldn't even find it on IMDB so the link above isn't actually an IMDB link... it does however, give some info about the movie.

The star of the movie is Ge You, better known for comedies, such as Big Shot's Funeral, and the bad guy role in A World Without Thieves.  This movie is being heralded as the first Chinese "Psycho" movie...
