,SickMinder,2006-10-05T13:14Z,Is this for the latest patch?
,Viianixis,2007-02-26T01:34Z,"Yeah - I am having a problem patching the .exe with these cracks - gives me an error when I start it up so patching to 1.08 to see what happens...

I originally downloaded the FEARdvd.iso file or whatever...

Version 1.00"
,TeamExploit,2008-03-26T07:17Z,"Worked perfect for me on the standard patch, updating now..."
,Lf2,2008-03-27T16:07Z,"Does anyone know where the new one is located?? I updated it so that I could play on-line, but it doesnt work now. I can only play online now which sucks. 
I Got the game from a friend. And of course, he's not going to let me keep the CD. So I got a crack, but then since I updated, I can't play 1 player mode. Anyone know what to do so that I can delete the update??"
,Pilbromatic,2008-04-23T00:59Z,"I havn't updated yet, but this crack works fine straight off the DVD version. Scanned for viruses with Nod32 and found nothing."
