The comforting familiarity of the Boards' muted beats, synth washes and glowing keyboards is just as potent and valium soaked as it was on their brilliant 1998 debut. Adding more colours to their dusk and daybreak designs, working off more traditional structures and filling out the beats and whirrs with the 'singing' of kids' laughter, robot voices and slide projectors. Futuristic but cotton wooled in dreaminess, their central heating for souls is just the thing to get you through the winter months.
