-TAGLINE-
	You have the right to remain silent...forever. (Note the non-existant exclamation point. Sloppy)

-WHAT THE BACK OF THE CASE SAYS-
	"New York City is terrorized by a series of brutal mutilation murders. The public is outraged, because it's discovered that the killer is a cop! Innocent policemen, are killed by the panic stricken public. The city itself is in an uproar. Will New York rid itself of this deadly menace...MANIAC COP?"

-WHAT REALLY HAPPENS-
	Unseen cop kills people. Bruce Campbell gets framed. Then beaten up. Then hit around some. Then the rest of the cast proceed to display the acting that won this film the Academy Award for 1988.

-Notes-
Hot off Evil Dead 2, Bruce Campbell takes on what is the most serious and demanding role of his career. Without an ounce of humor or slapstick, how will The Chin stop this Maniac Cop! From the writer of Phone Booth, Cellular, and Q: The Winged Serpent, MANIAC COP is a gritty  portrayal of the true problems that plague the NYPD every day!


This movie is actually available on DVD somewhere, but is a challenge to track down, probably OOP, hence this VHS version. If anyone has the DVD version, by all means  upload it so we can get rid of this shitty version. Long live cheese!
