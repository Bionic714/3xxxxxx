,Banzay27,2011-11-18T05:43Z,"Wait, I listened to samples of it from that amazon link. I've never watched the movie as properly, from start to finish, as well as I'd like, as well as I still will, but I don't recall this kind of beat music in the slightest. Every track is upbeat and not very sci-fi at all. The movie wasn't even cyberpunk.
What's the gig? Is this from a mini-series, then? Or am I just totally off?"
,Banzay27,2011-11-18T05:47Z,"Awww shit... ignore me. I really am totally off. More so than how I meant it when I asked if I was.
A thought only finally crossed my mind the instant I posted the last comment. I didn't look closely at the Amazon page beyond listening to the samples and reading the track listing. Since I was googling for something Dune-related, related to the game/movie series, I just presumed this was about that, as one of the first page results. I really know of nothing else to be known by the name Dune, at that.
Well, again, ignore my previous questions. Enjoy your trance beats."
