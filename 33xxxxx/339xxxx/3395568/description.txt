Magically defragments your system with ease!
The principle is ?Install & Forget?. Ashampoo Magic Defrag runs in the background as a service, defragmenting when necessary to keep the hard disk tidy. The great thing about this is that the program manages it without ?stealing? any processor power from the user. Ashampoo Magic Defrag only activates when enough unused resources are available and stops immediately whenever the user does anything that requires more computer capacity ? for example when a program is started or used. The program achieves this by monitoring all the relevant parameters, including processor load and hard disk access.
Users with the necessary rights and permissions can also monitor and control the program via a local network.

Ashampoo Magic Defrag Highlights:

Defragments the hard disk automatically and "invisibly" in the background.
Pauses defragmentation automatically as soon as other programs require processor capacity or access the hard disk.
Switching to Pause mode only takes around one second.
No analysis needed - defragmentation starts immediately! The advanced defragmentation algorithm eliminates the need for a time-consuming analysis phase. This means that the program is genuinely productive whenever it's running, even if it's just for a few seconds.
Install It & Forget It: Once the program is installed it runs in the background as a service and keeps the hard disk defragmented automatically.
Statistic functions for monitoring defragmentation.
Multi-user support: Once the administrator has installed the program it keeps running, even on restricted user accounts without administrator rights.
Also defragments the hard disk when no user is logged in.
Can be controlled and monitored via a local network.
