Complete file and system disk imaging backup and restore for home and home office users that can protect your entire system and family pictures, videos, music, and important documents stored on your home PC. Acronis True Image allows you to create an exact disk image for complete system backup and disk cloning providing the most comprehensive data protection.

- Two in One!
Acronis True Image 9.0 provides you two backup options in one solution:
1) Our original disk imaging backup option which enables you to create an image of your entire hard disk drive, including the operating system, applications, user settings, and all data. Use the image to restore your PC to a known working state without any reinstallation.
2) A new file-based backup option which enables you to backup and restore individual files and folders, like your My Documents folder or a specific file, like your latest tax return. A wizard walks you through all of the steps.

Acronis True Image 9.0 makes restoring your system even faster with the exclusive new Acronis Snap Restore feature. It also provides several additional enhancements:
- Exclusive Acronis Snap Restore ? Lightning-speed restore of your PC from an image. You can start working in seconds while your system is still being restored.
- Exclude files ? Save space when creating backups by only backing up the types of files you want to keep
- Differential backup ? Decrease the number of backups you manage. Differential backups capture the changes made since your last full backup
- Expanded Acronis Drive Snapshot technology ? We've expanded the no reboot feature to include backing up specific files and folders. We can even backup system files and open files with no issues. No matter which option you select, you can continue to use your PC during backup.
- Windows System Restore management wizard ? If you run Acronis True Image 9.0 regularly this feature in your operating system is redundant. Free up to 10% of your hard disk drive by disabling this default feature in your operating system using Acronis True Image 9.0.
