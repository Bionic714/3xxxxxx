,schmolch,2008-02-15T19:15Z,"CD2 is neither an ISO nor an MDF (alcohol), its garbage.
FUCK YOU"
,Dark Gogg,2008-02-26T19:30Z,"I LOVE FREESPACE 2. I played it when it came out, it was really awesome, went through it too. but then I lost the game cuz of changes of apartments all the time, so now I really hope that I get it. and it works. if it does you will many thnx from a SCI-FI fan"
,Dark Gogg,2008-02-26T19:32Z,"And it say in the download details that its 3 .ISO images, so FUCK YOU schmolch. if you cant use it, dont complain about sometthing as easy as an ISO file"
,Dark Gogg,2008-02-26T19:37Z,"And last thing, its GREAT and then I mean INCREDIBLE that this torrent can still be up and running after over 1 1/2 years."
,w0tness,2008-03-02T02:34Z,"Downloaded disc 2 only, to check for problems reported in earlier comments. Confirmed, cannot open Fs2AutoRun.exe, literally nothing happens when you try opening it. I don't know if other files on this disc are damaged, but if someone could upload only disc 2 (working) and send me a pm, I'd be more than thrilled. :-)"
,theWakeful,2008-03-05T00:31Z,"Just so I don't get lost once this is dled, what exactly do I have to do with the ISO files to make this game run? do I have to burn them to cd or can I extract them to someplace on my computer and run it from there? Also: has anyone figured out what to do with the second disc?"
,theWakeful,2008-03-05T22:38Z,I am also unable to open disk 2. the other two disks work fine though. Any word on where I can find disk 2?
,burnchar,2008-03-17T21:50Z,"This torrent DOES work just fine. Mount the ISOs with Dtools or A120 like TBAPb said.
Be sure to check out http://www.hard-light.net/wiki/index.php/Installing_Freespace_2
(Brado is NOT spamming)
The Freespace 2 source code was released, and these guys make an updated version of the engine, among other things."
,Brig22,2008-04-11T20:54Z,"I've tried Alcohol 120%, Daemon Tools, and Power ISO and nothing works; the installation gets stuck at 5% on Disc 2 and throws out a 'ComponentDataMove' error.

The exception is with Power ISO, that manages to get through disc 2 -- however, the same error message still pops-up on disc 3.

Does anyone have an idea what's going on here?"
,Brig22,2008-04-12T00:05Z,"I've now tried every possible fix I can think of:  

Used numerous image emulators, made new ISOs with the data, burned the old ISOs and the new ones, installed everything, all the way down to installing the bare minimum, crawled through a number of 'Freespace' related forums -- absolutely nothing works.

This is upload is quite simply a collection of corrupted garbage and a waste of time.

Avoid and seek out a better upload."
,burnchar,2008-05-22T11:49Z,"Works perfectly for me.

I just used Daemon Tools.

Perhaps the files were damaged while downloading, Brig22?

Those that download this torrent may want to download the FSO installer which updates Freespace 2 Open to the latest version, and can download various community-made expansion packs, graphical enhancements, etc:
www.fsoinstaller.com/files/installer/FreeSpaceOpenInstaller.zip

The torrent comes with a fairly old (2005) version."
,threadball25,2008-06-12T07:05Z,"I've seen some win xp installtions simply not install some games. i just upgraded my motherboard/ram chips/hard drive and some of my games won't work. they'll freeze or simply close during installation. do not be surprised if this is the problem. i have yet to find a way around it, but it seems to be a hardware issue in conjunction with win xp."
,zpoon_,2008-07-10T19:54Z,"Installation worked perfectly on Vista. Mounted the 3 ISOs with MagicDisk and worked like a charm.

Great torrent."
,LazerBlaze,2008-07-14T08:13Z,"can confirm this does work, see comment #3"
,LazerBlaze,2008-07-15T10:12Z,"AAHHH!!!....
Not this one! I meant this one:
http://www.torrentvalley.com/download_torrent_688474.html
(save the torrent file first the open it)
I thought it was this torrent cos it's so similar and I'm on TPB such alot, apologies TBAPb
I'm sure this torrent will work too, just don't burn it to disk and use Alcohol 120% to mount and un-mount the images
(use the task manager Ctrl+Alt+Del to switch between FS and Alc120% with when prompted)
Remember there's sometimes info in the image which can't be burned on to a blank disk because of the copy protection"
,Nohg,2008-07-18T20:41Z,"To all who have had troubles. 


Use Daemon tools.

Mount disc 1.
At prompt, REPLACE disk 1 with disk 2 in Daemon tools, tell it to overwrite it or w/e.
Tab back to installer, click OK (should be looking in whatever drive you have DT emulating).
Lather rinse repeat for Disk 3.

Works, just did it 20 seconds ago.

Sorry for my English not being so good."
,dstar2,2008-08-18T15:45Z,Works fine on 64 bit Windows Xp and Windows 2000. Thanks for this.
,gnidoc,2008-11-08T22:44Z,"2nd Disk problem SOLVED:
You have to turn on ALL emulation options in DaemonTools. 

Do this:

Right click on tray icon -> Select ""Emulation"" -> Select ""All options on"""
,zug420,2008-12-30T08:27Z,awsome download speed man thanks ive been lookin for this one for a while oh and i no this might sound like and odd request but could you possibly put freespace 1 on here thats if you have it or send me a link to were i can dl it and thanks again man
,FlyJayCeezy,2009-01-14T08:27Z,"OMG, sooo cool! Thx a milli'!
Installed on
Windows Vista Home Premium SP1 32 bit,
AMD Turion 64 X2 2GHZ 
NVIDIA GeForce 7150M/nForce 630M
3 GB Mem. DirectX 10.0
It takes up 1.19 GB (1,281,789,952 bytes) on my Hard Drive after Install.
I mounted files 1, 2,  & 3 ""when prompted""
using ""MagicDisc""(Alc' & Daemon Tools may work also). I had no problems what so ever after download. Keep Disk2 file mounted to play. Once you learn the controls game play is awesome(I use a controller/joypad{Logitech}), Graphics are killer, sounds pretty good. This game is too cool, Don't know why I haven't heard of this? I might actually do something crazy like go out & buy! But why bother when I got it here for free? Oh well...but I usually do support my fav' developers, artists, etc!

LOL, Thx again for the dl!"
,jvezirian,2009-02-27T08:16Z,"Thank you for the upload and the game, works great, I downloaded the no cd fix for the game and it works great. I do not want to sound like a NOOB, but just what does the open source file do? Will it enhance the game? Where should I unpack the MV pack?

,TBAPb,2009-06-25T22:32Z,"Guys, from the moment I've made this torrent - gone 4 years (yea, fuck my english - I don't care :) ) 
Since that time I've had: 
Lost my hdd totally
Lost my OS and didn't bother to recover
Downloaded this torrent from you somewhere in 2006 or 2007
Migrated to other OSes (fedora core back in 2006 and Vista in the end of 2008)
I've found a girl and we made a kid.
I've *upgraded* at my work from *do this shit, kid* to *Hey you, do this shit!* =)

And many-many-many other things happened.

And four years later this torrent is still alive.

Just thank you, guys (and maybe gals =)

And to the shitheads  - everything working, just use your brains, not your ass =)

,AssassinB,2009-09-09T14:08Z,"Umm, hi guys.  I know I may sound like a re-re saying this but when I mount the image, nothing happens and I try exploring into the disk and pressing the exe but it still dosent do anything.  Its weird..."
,bachternan,2009-12-12T12:05Z,"lost my originals, thanks for the cds!
works just like a charm."
,joewangtt,2009-12-12T18:53Z,"TBAPb, pretty amazing how torrents connect people, in good ways and bad haha. I enjoyed reading about the 4 years that have passed for you, and wish you good fortune with your family for whatever is to come, and good luck at your job (enjoy bossing people around!). Oh, and of course, thanks for making the torrent!"
,jason16424,2009-12-27T18:22Z,"indeed freespace was released to the public as open source, that's why there are so many mods out for it. ( i just came across this game in a google search like 15min ago and already know more than half the newbies downloading the damn thing. ) best of luck being a boss and a father. "
,Himherit,2010-01-18T05:30Z,"Works fine, even on Vista x64.
This game is NOT like Freelancer. It's not a sandbox game, it's a space combat game. You're given missions which range from ""kill everything"" to ""make sure these ships don't die"" and such. All you get are missions and you have no freedom to go out and do whatever. However it's still a superb game (especially after upgrading with Freespace Open). The version included in the torrent is OLD so be sure to get the latest information and stuff at their forums http://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php/board,50.0.html"
,Netot12345,2010-01-19T06:15Z,i remember my version(legal) had only 2 CD's. and this has 3??

,unknown455,2010-11-12T07:11Z,the download went very fast and i installed without any problem .when i tried running the game i get an error message saying the program can't start because i don't have enough RAM. it's odd because i have way more than the 32 MB needed. could someone please point out the inevitable stupid mistake im making?
,jay are two,2010-11-28T02:21Z,"Download latest FSOpen engine.  Not enough memory is caused by the program not being able to properly check for increments of 2GB IIRC.  1GB, fine, 2GB is read as 0.  3GB fine, 4GB, 0... get the latest FSOpen engine from www.hard-light.net/forums and it'll be fine."
,Dhorse,2011-03-10T20:45Z,"For Noobs everywhere.
This worked for me:
(and for those that don't like Daemon Tools either)

Virtual Clone Drive (freeware): http://www.slysoft.com/en/virtual-clonedrive.html

1- Download and install Virtual Clone Drive (don't forget to assign .iso files and the like to this program)
2- Click open Freespace_2_(1999).CD1.ChAoScReW.ShareReactor
3- Installing will begin
4- When it asks for CD2, open FREESPACE2_DISC2 and then click ok to proceed with the installation
5- When it asks for CD3, open  Freespace_2_(1999).CD3.ChAoScReW.ShareReactor and click ok to proceed with the installation
6- It will ask for CD2 again. Do the same (you have to keep CD2 running in order to play the game)

If you have Windows 7 you will probably need to right click the shortcut on your desktop, choose 'properties' choose 'compatibility' tab, check the box 'run in compatibility mode' (choose XP service pack 2), then check the box 'run as administrator', hit apply then ok.

Hope it helps those who have no idea how to handle .iso .bin types of files."
