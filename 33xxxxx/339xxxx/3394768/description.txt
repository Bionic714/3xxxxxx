    |                           SYNOPSIS                                 |
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------|
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------|
    |                  Shimizu on his short films:                       |
    |                                                                    |
    | In 1998, I was working as an assistant director on both film and   |
    | video productions. I was also taking a night class in film         |
    | production where the teacher turned out to be Kiyoshi Kurosawa     |
    | (the director of CURE and KAIRO, and the executive producer of     |
    | JU-ON the movie). He gave us the assignment to make a 3 min short  |
    | from an original script. It turned out that Kurosawa like my film  |
    | very much,maybe because it was horror and that was to his taste.   |
    |                                                                    |
    | Actually, it's never been my intention simply to make horror films.| 
    | I mean, I like horror films, but I had no real ambitions to make   |
    | them before this assignment.                                       |
    |                                                                    |
    | Eventually, Kurosawa introduced me to a producer at Kansai-TV who  |
    | was producing a 90 min. feature for television. The title was Gakko|
    | no Kaidan G (School Ghost Story G). G is supposed to mean "Great". |
    | Maybe the producer came up with the title to compete with Dragon   |
    | Ball Z, I don't know (laughs). It was going to be a horror         |
    | anthology and I was assigned to write and direct.                  |
    |                                                                    |
    | But because I had no previous professional directorial experience, |
    | the producer had no confidence in me. I wrote many scripts for 30  |
    | minute segments but the producer asked me to direct two and to cut |
    | them down to 3 minutes. I wondered, how can I scare the audience   |
    | in so short a time (laughs)? But those two short segments that I   |
    | made are actually the foundations of JUON. They lay out the basic  |
    | premise of the curse and it is almost like the true prequel of the |
    | story.                                                             |
