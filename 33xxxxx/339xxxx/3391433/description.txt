The front cover has a penguin with a picture of Zappa, and the words "music is the best". The back cover has a hand-drawn of the Barking Pumpkin Records logo: a penguin has replaced the cat, saying "Shut Up" to the pumpkin. "Uncle Penguin" and "Barking Penguin" are my favourite bootleg title and label!
On Uncle Penguin's Brain, "Dog Breath Variations / Uncle Meat" is listed between "Dupree's Paradise" and "Penguin in Bondage", not any "Uncle Penguin". Tracks 4-5, "Uncle Penguin" and "Dog Breath", are surely "Dog Breath Variations" and "Uncle Meat" in some way and order.
