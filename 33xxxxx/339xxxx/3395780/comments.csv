,Akaitchin,2007-12-08T09:19Z,Is this .rfl file possible to open to work in single files in windows?
,pmalus,2009-08-10T01:03Z,"I don't think it's possible to break up a ReFill file into the individual sounds.

If there's a way to do it.. i don't know about it"
,pmalus,2009-08-10T01:07Z,"Okay i just did a little research b/c i was curious.

There's a Reason Viewer and/or Unpacker that's floating around somewhere.

Many haven't seen it yet, but apparently it exists."
