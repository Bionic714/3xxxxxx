 Custom Mods.........: Added custom mplayer.dll compiled from latest CVS with GCC
                       3.4.4 using --disable-libavformat. This reduces memory
                       usage for better performance at the cost of not being able
                       to demux a few obscure formats.

                       weather entry in main menu to web browser.

 Notes...............: Went back to regular rar format per request, so no
                       fancy installer this time ;)
