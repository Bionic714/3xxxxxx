,Zakule,2006-01-07T03:19Z,Be warned.  Euro Emu is run by an empty-headed ego-maniac named Bisheeh who likes to run my rep through the mud because I owned his ass on his own forum.
,Zakule,2006-01-07T03:29Z,This from the guy who had to resort to editting my posts to save face....
,DennisPeriksen,2006-01-30T21:02Z,I know you get tired of hearing this but: PLEASE SEED :)  We adventure gamers must take care of eachother :p
,bonkeman,2006-02-01T21:15Z,"Full talkie versions of ""Flight of the Amazon Queen"" and ""Beneath a steel sky"" can also be download as freeware from ScummVM:s homepage, www.scummvm.org"
,DennisPeriksen,2006-02-02T14:41Z,Wtf?!! I cant get Broken sword running! ScummVM cant find any game :(
,Zakule,2006-02-03T02:26Z,Then you're doing something wrong.  Broken Sword 1 does work.  The standard uncompressed and ogg compressed versions both work fine with ScummVM v0.7.1 and later.
,DennisPeriksen,2006-02-03T19:16Z,"God damnit, :| I am so stupid,   I doubleclicked when I shoulde'nt :p"
,Zakule,2006-02-03T22:38Z,"Scratch what I said about ""DOCKS.CLU"" for Broken Sword 2.  The file is actually perfectly fine - confirmed from multiple sources with MD5 checksum."
,Zakule,2006-02-25T03:49Z,"wootletootle, it sounds like the files are becoming corrupted during download.  I'm not sure why that is.  Honestly, there are hundreds of different potential causes for such occurences.  One quick suggestion: if you're not using a P2P IP blocker then you should; I recommend Peer Guardian."
,no_nick,2006-02-27T22:08Z,"Why are there several versions of the same games? Some compressed, some not?"
,Zakule,2006-02-28T07:25Z,"^^^

I wanted to give people the option to download the original, uncompressed game files or a compressed version that's much smaller in size.  In retrospect, it probably wasn't such a great idea.  

I'm almost finished with an updated version of this torrent and the new one will only have the original, uncompressed game files."
,Promo3,2006-03-12T23:02Z,"ehm... i can't get Simon the Sorcerer to work. Well I can get it working but it need this copy protection thingy. It says I should check the manual. But in the manual you torrented it doesn't say a thing about it :P What to do? I've googled my ass off, can't find it anywhere. Thnx in advance, and thnx for one helluva good torrent man!"
,chronjohnson,2006-03-15T04:54Z,Bishee and EuroEmu are dead.  Fuck their shit.  I guess he showed us by refusing to release any more collections...really kept the donators donating.
,Zakule,2006-03-20T00:29Z,"The Floppy version of Simon the Sorcerer requires the original manual that shipped with that version of the game.  It's the only game in this set where the copy protection is still enabled through ScummVM (with every other game you can give any answer or the questions are bypassed altogether).  I recommend playing the CD-ROM version of the game since it has no copy protection.

Rumor has it that somebody plans to upload the manual for the floppy version of Simon the Sorcerer to replacement docs in the near future:

,bonkeman,2006-04-01T09:17Z,"Great work with this torrent Zakule! I don't understand the complaints about the torrent size though! You can download what you want and skip the rest!!!

Question: Is there a way to get speech AND text in Simon the sorcerer games? Can't get it to work... "
,Zakule,2006-04-17T07:05Z,"I've created a streamlined, updated version of this torrent:

,Geezguy,2006-11-04T20:26Z,Thanks for making a small version of Monkey Island 3. Is that in a DOS format or in that TOWN(something) format?
,Geezguy,2006-11-05T03:56Z,When I try to run Monkey Island 3 with ScummVM it says that it cannot locate the CMI.LA0 file. Why is that happening?
,shadow77110,2007-03-06T04:18Z,Nice torrent. It's hard to get some of these now. Thanks again.
,the_crazy_swede,2007-09-12T17:52Z,all of them works on the scumm vm ds port :)
,Geezguy,2007-12-19T11:41Z,"lol, never mind, I was a noob back there ^^"
,roryrattlehead,2008-05-23T11:48Z,"seed seed seed,im only downloading the dig and flight of the amazon queen"
,mother_fucker420,2008-08-31T11:43Z,should i be suspicious that this is a whopping 7 & a half GIGS while these games like Day of the tentacle are only 7 megabytes each??
,nanolathe,2008-10-03T14:00Z,Epic. A fantastic collection of some truly great games
