    SKINS INCLUDED:

    Original Project Mayhem III skin from CVS only.
    It guarantees everything works perfectly and keeps Releases Small & Clean.
    This skin is constantly changed and updated. I you want to use other skins,
    make sure they are suitable for this particular CVS Version of XBMC.
    Don´t ask me about problems with 3rd Party Skins - You´re on your own here !

    The only thing that´s changed is the look of the Webserver Interface.
    I replaced the Original with the Project Mayhem III Style Webserver Interface
    from KanadaKid (Scott). Looks very nice ´coz it perfectly fits the PM3 style.
    This also adds some small, but cool Functions to the Webserver Interface.

    FlexiBrowser / GameSaves / GameSpotPlus / GameTrailers / StupidVideos
    QuickTimeBrowser (Movie Trailers) / WebRadio (simpleKML V2) / XBMCLyrics

    All Scripts suit the Project Mayhem III style.

    I modified the SkinProject Mayhem IIIPALDialogSubMenu.xml so that all
    of the Scripts appear in the Scripts Submenu. If you don´t like this, or
    some of the Scripts, you should edit this file to your personal preferences.
    The original file from CVS has been renamed to DialogSubMenu.xml.CVS

    CHANGELOG:

    To keep this .nfo shorter, I only list the topmost 3 lines here, so you can
    see what´s included here. Always read the official XBMC Changelog at  
    http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/xbmc/XBMC/Changelog.txt?view=markup
    You can also find it in docsChangelog.txt

    10-10-2005 changed: how my music files keeps its path history.
               this should correct naviagtion issues with overlapping bookmarks,
               and bookmarks which can traverse into the playlists location.
               this changes how <default> path and activatewindow with a dest
               path work.  they are now behave as a virtual bookmark so back
               from there will display the root bookmark listing.
    09-10-2005 removed: my music top 100 window (use the library).
    09-10-2005 fixed: dvds wouldn't play.

    TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS:

    If you are experiencing all kinda weird problems using an updated version
    of XBMC it is always a good idea to delete the XBMC´s "SaveGame"
    using the Micro$oft Dashboard.
    Alternatively, just delete the E:TDATA face008 and E:UDATA face008 dirs.
    This is especially important if you are updating from quite an old version.

    To avoid problems you should also check - with every new release - 
    if the included XboxMediaCenter.xml has been changed significantly.
    You should then update your own customized XboxMediaCenter.xml accordingly.

    If using XBMC as Dashboard, don´t forget to update the files on DRIVE ´C´.


    IMPORTANT UNPACKING INFORMATION:

    If (after unpacking) you think this Release is missing files READ THIS !
    This is a Multi-Volume RAR Archive [Compressed with WinRAR 3.50]
    To unpack it you need to have all files in the same folder and start
    extraction from the first volume. Please use an UP-TO-DATE WinRAR or any
    other Program that correctly handles Multi-Volume RAR Archives.
