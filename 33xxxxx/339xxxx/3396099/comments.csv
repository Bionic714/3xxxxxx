,MrPoopers,2009-04-12T00:46Z,Amandax I will test it and see after it's done.  I have a special interest in this game.

,Joshua_Langit123,2009-12-18T06:12Z,"does this work on Playstation 1 when I burn it to a CD? I don't have a PCSXBOX so is it possible?
I've already Played 'Legend of Mana' but after a few accidental drops... I scratched it and It will not work anymore... that's why I am finding some TORRENT file about this game... 

thanks!!!
