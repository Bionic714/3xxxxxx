,grable,2006-08-04T15:46Z,"Allso check out ""Equilibrium "" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238380/

it has a similar story, but is a bit more action oriented though ;)"
,firmitas,2007-04-21T23:42Z,"Thank you for posting this movie: I had always wanted to see and could never find it. My only critique is that it would have been nice to have the City from where Montag came to be bombed at the end as it occured in the book; it would offer one of the implications of leading an unexamined life. At any rate, I do agree it is a fine movie. Directed by Trufeu no less!"
,TheRealZork,2007-12-09T09:59Z,"this version is much better quality:

,ufig256,2009-03-31T06:31Z,"Lmfao. You say that Illiterates ""have take"" over the world. Wow. Wow. Great book...I'm trying the movie out. "
,moreisless,2009-08-29T17:59Z,"Excellent message in this movie, excellent acting voices. They would remove all these movies if they could, or atleast cut them to shreads then make us all watch politically correct crap for the rest of time. I think you are preserving our history by sharing these original classics. yes, they would remove all movies/books and make us watch yucky yappy New york mincy remakes. May you have wind in your sails my friends."
,shasham,2010-06-13T13:38Z,Thank you so much for this!!!
,RC_Ebooks,2010-11-10T06:19Z,"""Book of Eli"" is a direct ripoff of this book/film. So watch THIS and skip that!"
,bellows,2010-11-11T11:44Z,"A true classic, thank you mybit."
,sckk,2011-01-26T04:34Z,Thank you
,digimike50,2011-03-30T14:15Z,Many thanks!
,noklpd,2011-11-19T14:15Z,"Thanks for the movie. But, I think Ray Bradbury message was not that Illiterates taking over govt. but people themselves don't want to read and dip themselves in extra large screens of Idiot boxes. That prediction came true very correctly. I also recommend to read a short story of ""The Murderer"" another fantastic prediction."
,kukrapock,2012-06-17T22:23Z,"Quality is so so, don't stick to your screen
No subs
Thx anyway
Will seed to play the game"
,Pa3PyX,2012-06-26T03:59Z,"One would expect movies to be more dramatic than books, but this one is the other way around. Unfortunately Truffaut dropped a lot of the action and vivid scenery that was in the book, as well as almost all science fiction elements (the Mechanical Hound, Faber and his communicator, Granger's trinkets). As mentioned here before, war is nowhere to be seen. The movie centers almost exclusively on characters (to that end, those who read the book may be pleasantly surprised near the end). I guess people were a lot easier to film at the time than Mechanical Hounds :)"
