ItÂ´s great that pieces like this one is available too, not only the main-stream-average-Hollywood-block-buster type of films...
This one actually has something to SAY to us."
,delahaya,2008-01-09T02:22Z,"Unbelievable.  Fellini from the US loves how the US vets got killed in Vietnam by the ""glorious"" communist Vietnamese.  With ""friends"" like him, who needs enemies?"
,FenixII,2008-02-13T01:17Z,"Nice doku, but why the constant phaser on the audio?"

Why do people say 'please seed'?
If the uploader is still seeding, put up with their speed, and if the torrents are a bit older, just hope people are still sharing it.

Did someone tell you that typing 'please seed' would get you faster speeds or something?"
