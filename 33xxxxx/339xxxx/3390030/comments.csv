,Faldune,2008-05-10T18:08Z,"I burned ISO file using Alcohol 120, but after burning, I'm supposed to restart my comp to do a clean install, but after I restart it just goes back to my desktop (like its not reading the dvd disk or something)??. It shows up in my disk drive, but when I double click the icon to start installing from the disk drive it tells me to restart comp from the disk to do a clean install, but when I restart it just goes back to my desktop again????. Can anyone HELP PLEASE!!."
,styleless_dude,2008-08-12T03:02Z,"well I think you wan't to start from the dvd right? To do so you'll have to restart the computer and you shall enter the ""boot menu"". Every computer has special button for that, but in must cases so can you read wich button it is on the screen... In the menu select ""boot from cd"" or something, you'll find out the rest ;P

Excuse my English, I'm from Sweden..."
