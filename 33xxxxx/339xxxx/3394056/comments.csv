,hadithegreat,2006-01-12T23:51Z,"One of the best movies of the year. Great story with simply superb performances. Add to that a great DVD quality and this movie will not disappoint. Although theres a tiny blurred spot near bottom left, you wont notice it after 5-10 mins. Absorbing movie. Worth a download!"
