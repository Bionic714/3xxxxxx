A series of musical doors and paths taking you into areas of Bulgaria and the surrounding regions. Recorded and edited by Jeff Mangum, these recordings amazingly transform the listener into feeling as if he or she were on site watching celebrators march down the streets in suits made of bells or winding thru crowds to hear angelic harmonies rising in the distance. The songs are all traditional to the areas in and around Bulgaria and performed by an array of local talent.


[b]REVIEW:[/b]
Fans of the great Ho! Roady Music From Vietnam collection and the Sun City Girls are shoo-ins to love this long collage of Bulgarian sounds recorded by Neutral Milk Hotel's Jeff Magnum on his trip over there. Like Ho!, the focus of drifting elements of the streets of a foreign land get brought to life stunningly, and like the Sun City Girls, the spotlight on the relative strangeness (as seen through the eyes of someone from another land) is cast to almost psychedelic effect. Magnum's juxtapositions of his recorded sounds are amazing: female choirs over disconnected conversation, clapping, instrumentation flow through a most pleasing river of pure sound.
