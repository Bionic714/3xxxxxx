 Although Dutch singer Laura Fygi initially garnered notice as a member of the disco group Centerfold, after setting out in 1992 as a solo performer she pursued a more jazz-inspired path with her debut effort Introducing Laura Fygi. On subsequent efforts including 1993?s Bewitched and the following year?s The Lady Wants To Know, she collaborated with figures including Johnny Griffin, Toots Thielemans and Clark Terry, and in 1997 Fygi worked with one of her idols, the great composer Michel Legrand, on Watch What Happens. Here is her 2000 Mercury Records release, now on XRCD2.
