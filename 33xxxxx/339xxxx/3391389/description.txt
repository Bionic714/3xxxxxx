This is the soundtrack from the documentary movie "Lucky People Center International". It is basically the whole movie, cut into mp3's after each scene.

This is not to get confused with "Lucky People Center - Interference" which is the official soundtrack for the movie, though remixed. This is a homemade release, and is not to be found as a CD product.

Sit back, relax, and enjoy the beautiful sounds!
