,Bobb999,2009-12-20T01:57Z,"I saw this at the theater a few years back. Thanks for sharing an online version.

I recall a clever little opium smoking scene from it,  just showing the form of a traditional Chinese opium pipe as a shadow cast on the wall, and a lot of smoke curling and wafting to the ceiling, with a caption like ""The Mysteries of China""!(Cocteau himself was a dedicated opium smoker for most of his life)."
