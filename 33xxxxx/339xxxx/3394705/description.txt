U96 - Biography					by Greg Prato

The German techno/dance outfit U96 is comprised of main members Helmut Hoinkins (the group's leader), Hajo Panarinfo (programmer), and Ingo Hauss (mixer and song lyricist), who are joined by others. Together since 1991, the group scored a big hit in their homeland straight away with a techno makeover of Klaus Doldinger's soundtrack theme "Das Boot," a number one hit which obtained platinum certification, which was followed subsequently by such further hit singles as "Heaven" and "Energie." In addition to their singles, U96 has issued three albums stateside thus far, 1992's Das Boot, 1993's Replugged, and 1995's Club Bizarre, while 2001 saw the release of the import-only collection, Best Of: 1991-2001.
