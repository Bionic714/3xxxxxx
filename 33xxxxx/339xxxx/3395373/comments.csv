[T],splattergod,2006-10-28T01:14Z,"Excellent. Always looking for white noise samples. I have an experimental noise project which focuses on white noise manipulation and white noise remixes, including a white noise remix box set of Pink Floyd.

,tranz,2009-10-24T04:35Z,"Wow can't believe this is still around. 4yrs later! Just had a new baby so I thought of this. I guess I'll seed it for a while. I am wondering what other uses people have for this?

Also good advice on not being too loud. I usually start it out loud and gradually lower it as they start to sleep.  "
,Hodenhannes,2009-11-28T10:43Z,"Whoa, I never thought anyone might actually have produced something like this. Thanks a lot!
I'll be using this for work. It's a noisy environment, and white noise helps me concentrate. "

,RC2314,2011-01-16T11:49Z,This works great for tinnitus. Drowns it out almost completely. I can go to sleep without wanting to kill myself :D.
,cr8s,2011-01-19T17:28Z,"Great white noise torrent... although I have to wonder if there's other data steganographically encoded in it.

HA... who am I kidding. Of COURSE there is.

@seizure1: I'd be much more concerned with the disorders caused by a child not getting enough sleep because of the ambient noises in an urban environment. The kid's gonna get PLENTY of auditory stimuli during the daytime, but you HAVE to shut that out to get a good night's sleep.

Chronic insomnia is a real bitch."
