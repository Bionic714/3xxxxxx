,Telordya,2008-05-17T01:42Z,"This is the original game and even with patch 1.20 or 1.30, the game doesn't start on my Windows XP machine. All my drivers are up to date. I recommend you to download the Gold Edition, this version works perfect on my machine http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3685255/Transport.Giant.Gold.Edition.READNFO-iTWINS

Don't install the patch 1.20 or 1.30 on the Gold Edition, you will break the game."
