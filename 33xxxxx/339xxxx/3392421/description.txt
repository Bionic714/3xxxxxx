GAME INFORMATION:
   -------------------
 
  This is the year 1850. It's an age of radical change and new departures.
  The era of mass production and mass transportation has just begun. The
  resourceful entrepreneur has plenty of opportunities. It's a time to build
  empires with just a little capital and a clever business idea.
 
  New manufacturing plants are springing up everywhere. The world craves
  goods of every kind. Towns are growing at a breathtaking rate. But how to
  get the goods to the customers? How can workers get to the plants? Who will
  haul the vast amounts of raw materials?
 
  The time is ripe for a big and powerful haulage firm. Industry
  transportation in particular is getting out of hand and conventional
  methods just can't cope anymore. Invest your little starting capital
  wisely, buy modern vehicles, and slowly build up a growing enterprise.
 
  Present yourself in a favourable light to your customers, and oust your
  opponents from the market. You'll need all your know-how and your skills to
  survive two centuries of changing economic tides and changing demands. For
  a start, steam locomotives might do, but later on you'll have to replace
  them with monorails or even superconductor trains.
