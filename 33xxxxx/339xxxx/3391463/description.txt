[quote]No-frills, power metal bliss. This Ralf Scheepers-led 
project (along with Matt Sinner of Sinner) is a mix of many 
styles-- 'Painkiller'-era Priest (with the distortion clarity of 

'Defenders' and muscle of 'Jugulator'); the heavy precision of 

Rage; and the melodies and inventiveness of a heavier Gamma Ray 

or Helloween. Makes sense, though, as Scheepers and guest 

guitarist Kai Hansen have pulled stints with some of the above.
Showcased are massive double-bass drums, solos that soar, 
splendid guitar fills, harmonics and pull-offs, and Scheepers at 

his vocal Halford-esque best.
"Chainbreaker" is a sharp and brutal opener, with an angry and 

powerful chorus. A bludgeoning main riff and soaring chorus 

vocals bolster "Promised Land," and the heaviness is matched in 

"Silver & Gold".
"Formula One" starts out with a high-pitched engine along with 

Scheepers, before a face-smashing guitar crunch descends... 
Excellent melodic work in the solo and latter stages of the song, 

and heavy post chorus and verse work!
"Dollars" is a tremendous power groove mover... Concrete, 
methodical, and mesmerizing. Check out the double-time riffs in 

the verses!
"Battalions of Hate" and "Running in the Dust" are simply 
superb---perhaps the top two songs on the disc. The first 
features biting guitar fills in the second verses, a bruising 

chorus, and Ralf getting up! The latter is pure head-moving 

power, with caustic stop-and-go pulls in the verses. The 

post-chorus procession is a tremendous melodic movement, ala a 

very heavy Helloween, which rolls around the 3:05 mark. 

Excellent.
Both "Nine Lives" and "Thunderdome" are fast and heavy, though 

inevitably will be slightly overshadowed on this opus of gems. 

And that, my friends, is a compliment.[/quote]
