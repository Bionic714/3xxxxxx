Episode # 7 in the series of comedic works from www.pornoreviewers.com, where Ross and Adam discuss the finer points of adult cinematography - and keep you laughing in the meantime.

This week's movie, Go Ahead Ream Me, is a fuck flick with no apparent plot. A few funny parts, but with a score of 4.5/5, it's definitely one we thought was worth downloading. Hot chicks, hot fucking and an overall well-done production. It's also Adam's last performance.. stay tuned next week to find out why!
