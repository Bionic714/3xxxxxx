As some of you know by now a tool called sfcure has been released on a 
well known site. There a versions of this tool avaiable. One is a bit 
older than the other one. I tested the newer one. Here is a little manual 
for you all.

1. RUN SFAFSB.EXE

2. click install the driver and press "ok" to put the needed information into your registry

3. restart your computer

4. RUN SFAFSB.EXE click start the driver

5. Get yourself a copy of Splinter Cell Chaos in mdf/mds format made with 
Alcohol 120%. The mds-file has to contain the DPM-information (DPM= Data 
Position Measurement). The mdf-filesize for Splinter Cell Chaos Theory is 4,15 
gigabyte (PAR SNAKE RELEASE).

6. Mount the image and install the game.

7. Start Starforce Nightmare 1.12 and disable your internal ide-Cd and 
DVD-drives (DISABLE CD) and also disable node (DISABLE NODE)

8. Now start the game while the sfcure-driver is started and starforce 
will verify that the mounted image is real. (Some of you maybe have to 
restart your computer because Starforce tells you to do this)

9. Enjoy Splinter Cell Chaos Theory without an USB-drive!
