Tiken Jah Fakoly - Coup de Gueule - last album 2004

Tiken Jah is a french speaking, africa's freedom activist. Born in Ivory Coast, he's currently exiled in Mali. His constant fight against Laurent Bagbo's dictatorship, the french neo-colonialism, the cancellation of Third-World debt and the new US military implantations are the main themes of his work. Here in France, and especially in Brittany (i'm a breton, wich is quite different from a french...), Tiken Jah is considered as the new Africa's herald.
