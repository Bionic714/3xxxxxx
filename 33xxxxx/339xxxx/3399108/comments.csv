Many people have problems playing movies in Windows MediaPlayer but do not change to VLC or similar players, many have problems playing music in Windows MediaPlayer bot do not change to Winamp or Foobar2000 or similar players. 
This is usually because the users are above ThePirateBay medium age and are not sure on how to install new software on their computers and use the bad default ones, and have had help installing Utorrent and have been shown how to search on piratebay. Help these users instead of calling them names.

The original 2006 comment is very old and the user have probably figured out how to play the songs by now. ^^

Very big thanks to odoinn for the upload and to all the seeders of these 3 albums."
