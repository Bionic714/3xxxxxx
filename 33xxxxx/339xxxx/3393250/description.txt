|  Atlanta-based Sevendust became one of the rising stars in late-'90s       |
|  heavy metal with an aggressive blend of bottom-heavy riffs and soulful,   |
|  accessible melodies. The band, comprised of frontman Lajon Witherspoon,   |
|  John Connolly (guitar), Clint Lowery (guitar), Vince Hornsby (bass), and  |
|  Morgan Rose (drums) first appeared in 1995 as Crawlspace, releasing the   |
|  single "My Ruin" on the Mortal Kombat: More Kombat recording. Shortly     |
|  thereafter the group changed their name to Sevendust and released their   |
|  self-titled debut in 1997. Two years later, they issued Home and played   |
|  over 800 shows alongside groups like Creed and a gig at Woodstock '99.    |
|  Their angst-ridden third album, the aptly-titled Animosity appeared in    |
|  fall 2001, and Seasons followed in 2003. In late December 2004 word       |
|  surfaced that Lowery had left the band, and those rumors proved true the  |
|  following February when Sevendust's announced ex-Snot guitarist Sonny     |
|  Mayo as Lowery's replacement. (Lowery, a co-founder of Sevendust,         |
|  eventually surfaced in the hard rock supergroup Dark New Day.) Next,      |
|  Sevendust's fifth album, appeared in October 2005.                        |
|                                                                            |
