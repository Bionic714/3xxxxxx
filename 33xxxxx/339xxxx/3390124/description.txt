Fun (Bowie): this drum 'n' bass track evolved from Is It Any Wonder, itself based on a 
line from Fame. To most fans, it will remain a bit of a mystery, as the two officially 
released versions were offered only to BowieNet members. 

A 3'31" mix featured on the BowieNet CD-ROM, distributed in 1998 to new subscribers 
only. The other officially released version is the Dillinja Mix, found on the 
liveandwell.com 2CD. 

A plethora of other mixes is promo-only. First of all, 7'42" "live" version, supposedly 
recorded in Amsterdam, Paradiso, 10-06-97, appeared on liveandwell.com (a section of 
BowieNet featuring live performances of the Earthling tour). This studio version, with a 
live audience mixed in, also appeared on a promo cassette for liveandwell.com, but was 
omitted from the 2CD that was distributed to BowieNet members.  A 5-track in-house 
Virgin promo CDR, still labelled 'Funhouse', contained the Clownboy Mix, Clownboy Mix - 
Vocal Up, Clownboy Mutant Mix, Clownboy Mutant Trance Mix and Clownboy Instrumental, 
while a second 3-track promo CDR labelled Funhouse contained Fade 1, Fade 2 and Remix; 
see Promos for four different in-house promos. Four variations of the Clownboy remix 
have appeared in rather poor quality on Glastonbury Messiah (BOW 2000).
