,mattatata,2007-08-16T09:21Z,Can someone tell me how i unrar files?
,mondocain,2007-09-03T04:30Z,Winrar is the prgram to get. Very simple to use and you can scan for viruses. There is a version on Pirate Bay..The Corpurate Version works great!

Also, if you don't mind, put your upload speed higher than 1kbps...this torrent is especially useful and greatly appreciated. "

,howcho,2009-01-08T23:02Z,"This was working fine for me but suddenly claims that I am missing the .ini file or that it is missing a path within the .ini.  I even deleted the old and downloaded a fresh copy but still have the problem. any help would be appriciated. BTW if you have the same problem as me you can still, after unraring, drill down into the cds to view the exercises."
