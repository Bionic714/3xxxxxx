,farty_breath,2010-07-08T07:09Z,"Nice one Rishi, loads and runs unlimited no problem.
I only wanted to view one djvu file and although this program can probably do this, I'm buggered if I could see how to do it. The djvu file even came up as a Lizardtech file but would not open.

If you just want to view a djvu file and not convert 150Tb of PDF to djvu try:-
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3937824/ABBYY_FineReader_Professional_9.0.0.662_DjVu
I found it easy to view the file with this and does not boggle the testicles to do so. Maybe I was in dick head mode and it is easy with Lizardtech, but not for me.
Thanks again rishi"
