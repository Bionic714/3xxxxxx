,Ibespasticairsoftprincess,2006-01-02T19:52Z,so is this the complete sound score ? .... becuase there are only 9 tracks im confused 
,boshtalk,2006-03-07T04:33Z,"Yeah, put the whole thing on here.  It's not like you can sell it.  Why just a ""sampler""?"
,pepito1969,2006-03-10T14:22Z,"Dominic, this soundscore is just wonderful, i hope there are any way to get more of it!"
,BlessX1,2006-05-11T13:00Z,seed plz
,vinylpusher85,2006-07-11T02:26Z,"holy shit, i cant wait to get this downloaded! BIG UPS for doing this."
,tuppennytopper,2007-04-07T23:39Z,"This appears to be the soundtrack ripped from the movie with a karaoke voice cancellation filter applied.

If I'm right, WHAT A TOTAL CON - YOU SHOULD BE STRUNG UP!

If I'm wrong, what the hell are Nagra Tapes and how did you come by them when literally hundreds have searched and found nothing..."
,tuppennytopper,2007-04-08T12:23Z,"Actually, listening more closely, has this been lifted from a surround sound channel?

Come on Dominick - this is a fantastic project and people would be willing to help if you communicate with them!"
,tuppennytopper,2007-04-21T06:32Z,"What a surprise - I KNEW IT!!!

This is a copy of the text from another of ""Dominicks"" so-called torrents - the Goonies Sampler.

Dominick clearly admits:

""First of all, this is not a copy
of the CD, I carefully pulled
this audio from the Goonies DVD

As you can tell, there is only
the music, and sound fx, occasionally
you will hear voices for the surround
channel effect, these haven't been
removed as I don't know how, but I
also don't want to remove them either.

I am 23, and I previously lived in
Japan, because I was in the US Navy.
I never found the ORIGINAL soundtrack
to the movie.  The original one is the
one you hear in this mp3.  I own two
Goonies CDs, one is a soundtrack of
songs, the other is the music.

The music was RE-RECORDED, and it is
not the original that we all heard
in the movie.  Nobody owns the actual
soundscore, even if you think you do,
you don't, trust me on this.  If you
have the soundscore, where is Data's
theme on that?  Exactly my point.

I have extracted every second of audio
from the opening of the movie to the
last credits.  I am in the process of
splitting up the entire set on two CDs.

There will be at least 25 tracks total
and I am guessing near 40 or so.  It
will look something like this.....

Here is the first five minutes of track
information for my CD.

01 - Dialogue - Jailbreak
02 - Goonies Theme #1
03 - I Got Nothing
04 - Goonies Theme #2
05 - Dialogue - Mouth's House
06 - Goonies Theme #3
07 - Data's Theme
08 - Goonies Theme #4
09 - Dialogue - 4 Wheel Drive
10 - Goonies Theme #5

That's the tracklist for just the first 5 minutes!

There are a lot of times when the soundtrack
repeats itself, and I am putting separate
tracks between the music, and the dialog.

This project should be completed in late
September 2005, email me for details as
I am a busy college student, and doing this
in my part time.

Thanks everyone

So there you have it.

No Nagra Tapes (whatever they are), just surround channel audio taken from the DVD.

Great idea, but not exactly as described eh Dominick?"
