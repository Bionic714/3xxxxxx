This nifty web browser allows you to connect directly to our portal (no changing network settings)
 
It only works with UMD Emulator 0.8c!

Simply copy the ISO file to the /ISO folder on your memory stick, boot it up with UMD Emulator, upon loading goto EXTRAS, then click DOWNLOADS. The browser will then load, full instructions are on the browser, internet access with a wireless access point is required.

Includes:

*User registration to store your favourite links
*A URL Field 
*Multiple Languages to come
