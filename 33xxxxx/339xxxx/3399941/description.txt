Album Description
 
An Album that celebrates the five cycles of mankind with musical diversity you can expect from a Lucius production. The intention of the album is to bring to mind the subject that has been writen in stone regarding the ages of humanity over millions of years in both the physical and spiritual domains. This epic adventure into sound begins after curiosity grows in the questioning behind why we are all here. The Five Ages of Humanity brings mood inspiring tonnes and harmonies with a freshly served plate of beats taking your thoughts away to other places.
