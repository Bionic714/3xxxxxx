Special Air Service Survival Secrets Series 1 Episode 2
XVid format about 720MB+
Good overall quality at TV screen size

Hopefully people will seed this long enough so that there are enough sources to keep this available to all.

But don't be fooled... there are no secrets divulged in these series about the SAS. All you see is standard infantry procedures with an SAS label to it...
What you do see though is just how unique the SAS is in as much as a very small unit of highly skilled men performing and switching between many tasks in a very short period of time.

Can anyone get S01E04 of the same series?
