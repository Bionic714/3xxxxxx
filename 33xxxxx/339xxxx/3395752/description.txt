Adolphson & Falk - From Here To Eternity (1983)
English version of "Med Rymden I Blodet"

Ok, so I messed up the last time...
I wasn't pleased with the result myself.

Here's a FLAC version, since I remember some comment about that....
It's a completely new rip, MUCH better than the last one.

And the tracks are...

1. They Put My Baby On The Air
2. Just A Machine
3. Waves In The Air
4. Fifth Avenue
5. Body Machine
6. From Here To Eternity
7. Stockholm Serenade
8. Sheer Attraction

Vinyl (Re)Rip by MudShark

Enjoy.
