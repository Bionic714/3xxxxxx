,Kathryndarkstar,2006-01-05T15:01Z,"So I was burning the game onto CDs for my sister, and I noticed that I was unable to burn disc 4. I kept getting an error. I tried to open it with Daemon-tools. Error. I looked at it and there's no img or sub files. Only a CUE and CCD. I haven't had any issues with the other discs before this... If this isn't an issue I can't fix without re-torrenting, would someone maybe be kind enough to send me the .img for disc four? Maybe? Please? Chieoneesama@aol.com."

But i know now hot to make it work :).

 1. You Unrar the files within the Disc 1 Disc 2 etc.
 2. When you unrar the Install CD you Mount the IMG file.
 3. When you mounted the Install CD you'l see another IMG put that in a folder.
 4. Now! You Mount CD 1 2 3 and the IMG file that you've got out of the INSTALL CD.
 5. Now Install by going to the FF8_Install CD and by pressing the Startup file.

Hope i've helpd you guys :)

 BTW: This is my 1st..second FF game the first one was the GBA FF lol :)."

Alot of steps, but that is all i could find to make it work.

,SimonForsman,2006-09-14T04:20Z,"For people who get wierd graphical artifacts (stripes or black blocky edges arond stuff),

the reason for this is that the game uses 8bit paletted textures, nvidia has removed that feature from their graphics cards since ""nobody used it anyway"", 

currently the only solutions are:
1. Get an older graphicscard (GeForce4 or older) + old drivers.
2. Use the software renderer (run the config thingy that comes with the game),
3. pray that square or your nice neigbourhood hacker releases a patch that fixes the problem. (it was done for FFVII , but that was a far more popular game)"

then extract the patch in you FFVIII folder

extract the main file then extract each disc
STEP2.
mount the install disc and also mount the image on the install disc (so u will need 2 virtual drives!!)
STEP3
install the game
STEP4
change the reg as owikh84 said

You just need to open your registry (press Start > Run > type ""regedit"" and change the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Square Soft final fantasy/1.00 ""DataDrive"" into the driveletter you're using with your mounted disc.

The key in your registry is ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Square Soft
STEP 5
then mount ff8 dics 1 on to the drive u defined in step4 
STEP6
run the game and play. change discs as required
EXTRA
if u have graphic or control problems then run the ff8config in the start menu and change to software renderer and set controls

u can also down load two patches for this game just google it!!

one other thing is i cant change the music volume.. and cant quit the game so i just ctrl/alt/del and end task, this is also a good way to change the disc image but hey now i'm telling ya how to suck eggs

i hope this helped have fun"

For some reason my comp just doesnt start running installation ;< I even burned install disc and tryied everything but it just doesnt start running it neither from setup or startup.exe ;< I'm kinda out of solutions now so i'm asking if any1 had this problem or any1 knows is there anyway to fix this?!

PLEASE HELP"
,JLLI,2007-09-03T21:19Z,"here are my instructions (though i can't garentee they'll work as after i finished i wasn't able to go back and check)

Required programs: 
1.Virtual daemon manager
2.winraw

Warning notes:
1. Please ignore any windows ?popups? (no not the freaking Internet popups) the WINDOWS popups that say stuff like min plate and stuff like that.
2. Follow all my instructions if you want to complete this installation under 2 hours

Lets start (although if you are reading this you should already have the hardest steps completed)
1. You see a funny file called FF8 1 FF8 Disk 1 and a bunch of other strange icons
2. open the FF8 starting file with winraw 
3. extract all files to a destination of your choosing  (any drive)
4. install daemon manager if you haven?t already
5. right click on the daemon manager symbol (circle inscribed in square with a red lightning bolt through it)
6. left click virtual CD/DVD select the drive D: and MOUNT the IMG file FF8 install CD
7. next mount the IMG file FF8 Install  (the order doesn?t? really matter but where you put this file is where you will have to mount all the other CD?s) (MAKE SURE THAT YOU MOUNT THEM TOGETHER DO NOT TRY TO MOUNT TO SAME DRIVE)
8. Install the game (CHECKPOINT! After you install start it up and try to start a new game if it doesn?t start up the you probably should hit yourself on the head REALLY hard for not following my instructions)
9. click on start
10. click on run
11. type in regedit
12. click on the file HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
13. click on SOFTWARE
14. click on Square Soft Inc
15. click on FINAL FANTASY VIII
16. click on 1.00
17. click on data path and enter the ?virtual? drive mine was H: that you mounted the FF8 Install
18. go back to daemon and unmount all the drives
19. extract all files of CD1 to any hard drive you want
20. mount the Final Fantasy 8 CD1 IMG file (there is only 1) onto the drive that you mounted FF8 Install 
21. now start up final fantasy 8 and start a new game if it says : please insert disk 1 then you are an idiot for not following my simple instructions? just go back to step 8 and make sure you understood all my instructions
22. Now for the people who got past step 20 GOOD JOB! Pat yourself on the back for not wasting 5 hours trying to figure out how to do this.
23. Have fun with disk 1 and for disk 2 do the same thing (extract all the files of disk 2 mount the IMG file and have fun for the rest of the game)!"

I unistalled it cuz I'm just fed up with it maybe i'll try again in a week or something, it's very frustrating, as soon as i think i have it working something else goes wrong."

Download the torrent

STEP2.
if you don't have ""Azureus"" go here and follow the instructions:

http://thepiratebay.org/help


Step 3: After you get the real file downloaded from the torrent client (should take about 2-3 days at most). Unzip the files using winrar.

If you don't have winrar get it here and install it. 

http://www.freedownloadscenter.com/Utilities/Compression_and_Zip_File_Utilities/WinRAR_Download.html

Awesome program i must say. 

Step 4: extract all files from the ""Final Fantasy VIII PC Version 5 Disc + Goodies"" file. if you don't know where you downloaded it. it should probably be in,

 C:\Documents and Settings\Owner( or the user name if you have a multiplee logins, or named this account different)\My Documents\Azureus Downloads\FF8

that's a nearly perfect copy to use and paste right there above. Just edit it for use.

Step 5: extract all disk and just get this process over with, then check sure their aren't anymore files that need to be downloaded. if so they should have a book like icon over them.

Step 6: okay now if you don't have daemon tools they've provided it for you. Just install it.

once it's installed right click the lightning bolt icon in the small tray in the lower right hand of your screen. go up to ""virtual cd/ dvd/ rom"" and the pop-up menu should reveal itself. if not hold it there for a second. 

Step 7: mount the ""Final Fantasy 8 Install CD.img"" the min plate should pop-up.

Step 8: copy this ""ff8_install.img"" 

create a new folder in the directory where all the disk files were unzipped.     (does not need to be named)   

paste the file ""ff8_install.img"" in this folder

Step 9: once this is done mount the file onto daemon tools

right click the icon in the lower right hand coroner, go up to virtual cd/ dvd- rom and mount  the ""ff8_install.img""

Step 10: The file should load and bring up the install program, if not you fucked up somewhere.

If your good then install the game. they've really easy instructions, if you screw this up your a dumbass. 

change the reg as owikh84 said

You just need to open your registry 
(press Start > Run > type ""regedit"" 
and change the 

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Square Soft final fantasy/1.00 ""DataDrive"" into the driveletter you're using with your mounted disc.

if your using one mounted item it's usually f. you should make this

 drive h:

The key in your registry is ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Square Soft

Step 11: This is the easy part. after you have installed the disk click exit from the pop-up install window if your done.

the right click the red lightning daemon tools program icon in the lower right of your screen. mount the ""Final Fantasy 8 CD 1.img"", if this doesn't appear in the menu for files, go click the file type bar and allow it to view all files. this should reveal it's location if your in the right folder.

 remember disk 1 (extracted files folder)


okay now go to the ""set device parameters"" button and open. this is located on the sub bar where you mounted disk one.

(small daemon icon, right clikc, virtual cd/ dvd-rom, mounted item/ empty drive where a file should be   XO          , sub-menu ""set device parameters"" below the mount image/ eject tray/ umount image titles

change the drive letter to h

Step 12: Go to my computer

in the address bar paste:

""C:\Program Files\Eidos Interactive\Square Soft, Inc\FINAL FANTASY VIII""

without the quotation marks....?idiots?.....not yall by the way my friends.

Step 13: play the game. if it says load disk 1 or wrong disk, you mounted the wrong disk that your trying to play.

so yeah go back to step 11 and see where you went wrong. 

also when you load games such as if you play to disk 2 or 3, or 4. don't mount disk one. mount the disk you're on.

also if you're looking for cheats there are a few ont the internet. although most are for the ps2 theres a small # of themthat work for the pc version we have here.

,masshwh,2008-01-21T01:29Z,"For anyone having trouble mounting the images on DAEMON in order to install the game here's a little sub-tutorial:

1) Right-click Daemon icon (red lightning bolt) in your desktop toolbar

2) Choose ""Virtual CD/DVD-ROM"" from menu

3) Choose ""Unmount all drives"" from menu

4) Repeat steps 1 & 2.  Now choose a virtual drive from menu.  In my case it was ""Device 0: [G:] no media""

5) Choose ""mount image"" from menu

6) A window titled ""Select new image file"" appears.  Browse to the folder where you extracted the ""Final Fantasy 8 Install CD.img""  Choose the file and click ""Open""  
****If you can't see the ""Final Fantasy 8 Install CD.img"" then you need to go the the bottom drop menu titled ""Files of type"" and set it to ""All files"".  You should see it now*****

7) Once you open ""Final Fantasy 8 Install CD.img"" a new window will appear with 4 files in it.  Copy the one called ""FF8_Install.img"" to some place you can get to/remember easily.  A sensible place would be the folder where the ""Final Fantasy 8 Install CD.img"" is, but you could even use the desktop I suppose.

8) Now repeat steps 1 to 5 if you have only one virtual drive enabled or else you can just mount on a different virtual drive.

9) In the ""Select new image file"" window choose the ""FF8_Install.img"" file that you just copied and click ""Open""

The install screen now appears and your are one step closer to gunblade packing chocobo drifting goodness!

Some help here"
,sarnox,2008-02-17T16:35Z,"ok for all smart ppl out there:
the game works well with vista, I took the patience to read all the comments here and figure out why so many couldn't get it to work.

Here are the solutions to the main two problems I had:

Unlike most rar-ed iso/img or w/e this one contains 4CDs + an img called the ""install CD"" you need to mount this. After doing so open the cd and copy/transfer the install.img to your HD and mount that one.

What I'm saying is that the install.img contains another install.img which is the one you need to transfer and mount.

If the game doesn't load with vista, e.g. black screen or texture problems, just open the installation directory and move the FF8.exe file to your desktop.
The thing is the game seems to crash/freeze if the ff8.exe is inside the ff8 directory with the rest of the files. So just move it out of there and shortcut it to whereever you put it or better just keep it on the desktop.

It's a whole pain in the arse to unrar the package, then unrar the single Cd-bundles and finally extract the install.img from the install CD, but I can assure you the game works 100% with vista, it's just a bit messed up.

,WillPG1212,2008-02-17T21:20Z,"Hey fellas. iv downloaded this and it works great.

i was really lost with all these files for each CD, but i have a much simpler solution for the Newbies like me.

extract the first file.
extract all the Cds in separate files
and then, simply open the .img file with a program called ImgBurn, its really fast and it works great (and i dont have any black squares on my screen when i play)

PS. u have to burn them onto discs, its not a solution for people who want to play without burning. but hey, it worked for me, so try it.

thanks for uploading this, i love this game,

I unRARed everything, loaded the install disk image, then copien the installer from that image and mounted it.

I click the install button and... nothing.
the readme and exit buttons still work, did I do something wrong?

After reading all these comments i finally figured out how to get it working, and now its working, except for 1 problem.

It loads up fine, and other than the front menu (New game, Continue, Exit) the game is EXTREMELY laggy.

I have tried changing several different setting for about an hour now, and its always laggy.

Anyone know how to fix it?"
,DontgUp27,2008-05-16T00:45Z,"For everyone who is having trouble installing this game, follow these simple steps.

1. Go to this website address. http://membres.lycos.fr/demigosh

2. Read everything on that site and follow directions.  You should be able to get your game installed and working.

If you have problems understanding that guys steps then maybe I can clarify a bit more.  
1.Download the file.
2.Install daemon tools program which is included. Unarchive the ff8 archive.
3.Ok now unarchive all the 6 archives.  
4.Then extract all the files from the 6 archives to a folder of your choice.  (This allows us to mount the image files with no problems.)
5.After all the files from the 6 archives are extracted, open up daemon tools.  
6.In daemon set the number of devices to 3, so that you can have 3 virtual drives, which is under virtual cd/dvdrom section .
7.Then open device 0 and click mount image. Then go to the folder where you extracted all the files from the 6 archives.  Look for the file ""Final Fantasy 8 Install CD.img"" and select it.  Ok now device 0, in daemon tools virtual cd/dvd section, should list that mounted image.  After that a window should open up showing the contents of your virtual cd in the virtual drive.  
8.  Ok now go to daemon tools virtual cd/dvdrom section and select device 1 and select mount image. Make sure your in Min Plate device 0 virtual drive when the window comes up to mount an image.  Then select ""FF8_Install.img"" file and open it.  The FF8 installation window should come up.
9. ok now install ff8.

Ok if you made it this far your very close to being done.
10.  Follow the instructions about the registry in the address above.  This part tells the software to search for the cd in which virtual drive.  The drive letter must be the one in which the the virtual drive in daemon tools is mounted to.  So for instance your device 0 in daemon tools is letter D:, you would need to put that in the registry.  You can change the virtual drive letter in daemon tool by selecting ""device parameters"" under whichever device you select.
11.  If your having trouble with step 10 just read the guys step in the address again. I didn't have problems understanding his steps.  
12. Ok now that is done just start ff8, after your set your ff8 config, and view the intro to the game.  
13.  When it asks you to enter disk one in the game, you must ctrl +alt del to get back to desktop.  Close the task manager.  Now is the time to umount all drives in the daemon tools.  This erases images previously mounted, which were used to install the game.  Then select device 0 and click mount.  And go back to the file where you extracted all the files from the 6 archives and find the ""Final Fantasy 8 CD 1.img"" file and open it.  Now that tells daemon to open that file under that virtual drive.  So that device virtual drive letter should  be the one in which you put in the registry step so that the software looks into that virtual drive to start the disk 1 game.  Ok now get back into the game and the game should start.Whenever the game asks your to insert different disk look for the file similar above but with the different number for cd 1,2,3, and 4 and mount that image after umounted previous images.

I hope this has helped.  Good luck, if you have trouble just repeat the steps, I'm sure it's more than enough to get it right.  

If you have video problem maybe its your graphic card or video config...try different settings.  Perhaps can also be that your computer doesn't meet the systems requirements."
,snakebite019,2008-05-16T05:39Z,"

Snake I think then it's probabaly related to vista.  I read vista os give some problems to xp games.  I am using windows xp sp3. 


elcachibombo I see you have vista and it's probably related to vista.  But after you start ff8 and go through the intro and asks you to enter the disk 1 in the game..., that is when you ctrl+alt dele then open daemon and mount the cd1 image to your virtual drive.  If you did that then I'm guessing the problem is with vista os.  Maybe microsoft did something so that virtual drives aren't read or something. Not sure but if you can try it on windows xp "

,snakebite019,2008-05-22T01:55Z,"lenneheartbreaker,

That is an interesting case...
The error actually says ""Program doesn't work anymore""? or does it say something that means that.
Also, did you mount the CD images to a virtual drive or did you burn them to discs?
If you did, then try restarting your computer, and go into the FF8Config.exe file in the FF8 directory. Change some of the video settings there, and see if it works. Also it you are using Vista, don't run it with compatibility mode or anything."
,davidh122,2008-05-22T02:03Z,"oh right i am running it on windows vista but i dont have a clue how to change whether compatibility mode is on or off lol i'm completely new to all this, and it definatly just says error, wrong disc :S"

bit fort it was for me haha"
,snakebite019,2008-05-22T03:11Z,"davidh,
From what i understand, there are 2 ways to solve this problem.
The first on eis the way i did it, burn the .img files to CDs. There are a lot of programs that can do this.
The other way is to when it says insert disc 1, hold in alt and press tab on your keyboard, then mount the disc 1 to the correct drive, and then go back into FF8 from the taskbar and it should work.
This is a lot of hassle though, and i prefer just using real discs"
,lenneheartbreaker,2008-05-22T11:32Z,"snakebite019 

I use the deamontool program ánd I burned the discs as well... just to try 2 things... but I need to restart my computer?? mm.. I will try now :) lol if it would work. be back in a jiffy :D (or something like that)

ps. what do you mean with 'don't run it with compatibility mode or anything.' ??? you mean the thing you can choose when you start op your pc? I just run it in normal mode... :) if that is what it is... :D"
,lenneheartbreaker,2008-05-22T11:46Z,"still aint working...

it says; the program doesn't work anymore.
and I got 2 options... search on the internet for a solution, or end the program.
this is when I restarted my computer (btw laptop) and I changed every thingy of Graphics... which aren't a lot to change. I got a smaller screen, but I couldn't go on with the game like I said before... :/ and I used the deamon tool now...

Also, go to your Program Files directory on your computer and go to the FF8 folder. Right Click and drag the FF8.exe file to your desktop. A little box should pop up. Click ""Move here""."

,marijumanji,2008-07-04T22:02Z,"Thought I would add my comments because this one was a bit tricky to get working. At first I ran into the same ""Insert Disc 1"" problem that people were having, I tried mounting disc 1 to no avail. Then I tried the other method of downloading the crack as Thype suggested. When you get the crack and read the nfo file you get quite an ominous warning that says the ""Game is unrippable"". The crack suggests you copy the information off the CDs into your directory, I tried this and it didn't work either. 

Finally I went all the way back to page 1 and read about the ""Regedit"" way. I've never done that before but I tried it, WinXP says ""an administrator has disabled Registry editing"" which is odd because I've never done that and I'm the Administrator!

Anyway, a quick search on Google ""Regedit Windows XP"" or something like that, and in the first 3 links I found a program that would allow me to bypass the Windows XP bullshit. I followed the instructions on what to edit, basically I changed the ""Data Drive"" from ""D:"" to ""H:"" because H is the name of the Virtual Drive in MY Daemon Tools (might be different on your comp). I mounted disc 1 on Daemon Tools... Started up the game... and oh YES sweet blue waves and the opening cinematic. 

Anyway it took a little farting around but I got it to work, so I'm glad. I also learned a little bit in the process. Noobs might want to avoid this one if they don't want to take a little extra time to carefully read what people have been saying to try and help them.

Also the game looked all fucked up (for me) until I changed it to ""Software Renderer"" in the Final Fantasy VIII Config file. And I'm using an Xbox 360 controller and lost the first boss battle because the analog stick is so glitchy, and it's impossible to change it to the D-pad. I've changed it to keyboard and will see how that goes. "

Mount the install cd (Final Fantasy 8 Install CD) and a window will pop up with 4 files, then mount FF8_Install from that window. The main install window should pop up and install it.


After installing the game, press Start > Run > type ""regedit"" open this key
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Square Soft, Inc\FINAL FANTASY VIII\1.00 and change ""datadrive"" into the drive letter where you want to mount the images. For example, mine is F: using Daemon tools


Again, be sure that you set the data drive registry key to the drive letter that you mount the images on and be sure that disc one is mounted in that drive when you start the game or you'll get a message telling you insert disc 1."
,RenanSPH,2008-07-09T16:42Z,"I tried to change the key in registry to j:, where the image is mounted, but still with the 'wrong disk' message. I tried to mount 'Final Fantasy 8 CD 1.img' in j:, dont worked. I tried to rename 'Final Fantasy 8 CD 1.img' in to 'DISK1', i press X in game, but still with the wrong disk message.

,RenanSPH,2008-07-10T15:09Z,"Thanks, worked perfectly. Forget my early post, i just forgot to run the game as admin. If any1 is gettin the same trouble just run the game as admin.

Thanks."
,Thype,2008-07-11T00:31Z,"figggy,
If you really followed my instructions and it has not worked then you should probably try the other main method (switching the drive check via regedit, check frequent's post).  Either the no-cd or that usually works.  Also, did you make sure you have only the files from disc 1 copied over?"
,rob-fred,2008-07-14T04:46Z,"This is MUCH more easier than it's explained here. If you managed to install the game, but not managed to mount the cd-files you have another much more easier way. C:\Program Files\Eidos Interactive\Square Soft, Inc\FINAL FANTASY VIII

Go into that direction and simply doubleclick the FF8-file, and you are on gaming. Figuered it out after a lot of tries. Hope it helps for you ;p"

,EvilLlama,2008-08-15T17:58Z,"After reading all 13 pages of comments, I have yet to understand many of the directions listed here on installation of this torrent. My hope was to replace something I (almost) lost in a house fire, but it seems I am not capable of following this listed instruction (that are very good, and nicely detailed). This is my quandary;

1. Downloaded torrent
2. There are no files to be extracted. 
3. I can mount the image listed as ""Install Disk.cue""
4. I can ""autorun"" the mounted image.
5. an installation screen appears, and gives me the four options to chose.
6. I click on the ""install"" option and I get the ""thinking"" cursor for about 5 seconds.
7. Nothing happens.
8. I open task manager and the process listed as ""STARTUP.EXE"" (the installation splash process) is open, but not active, and the process listed as ""SETUP.EXE"" (the actual program that is to install the game) is open, but not active.

A bit of background on my system;
1. Windows XP
2. Damon Tools (just updated to the latest version.
3. I use bit torrent to DL

So here is my questions, in order of relevance;
1. What files are supposed to be extracted if there are no files listed as RAR files (except those that are in the actual install disk)?
2. When I mount the image of the install disk, where is the image within the image?
3. Is there a step I am missing?
4. How do I make the ""SETUP.EXE"" file open AND run (right now it just opens, but it does not run)?

I have tried to move files as explained earlier, copied the images to disk, attempted to find the elusive ""image within the image"" file that doesn't appear to exist, all to no avail. I know someone has had the same issues as I, but there was no clear explanation as to how they alleviated their issue.

I saw a few ""email me if you have any other problems"" posts as well, but it seems a bit odd to bother someone on an offer that is over 12 months old. Any suggestions as to what I may have done, or not done, thus far? (i miss this game, and would love to play it again. Damn house fire!)

Thank you in advance

,blood-pool,2008-08-28T09:53Z,"Hey this game is easy to run.

Simply extract all the files so you are left with image files only. 
With the install disc I had to mount it, then copy the new image files out (it had an image file in a image file). Now mount and copy all the files from disc 1 through to 4 into a temporary folder. You may be asked to over write 3 files, it doesn't matter if you over write or not as they are identical on all 4 discs and will be installed off the install disc if you choose ""install additional data"" option.

Now copy all the files off the real install disc into your temporary folder. You'll know it's the right one because you will be prompted to install when you mount it, but don't install for now.

Now you should have all the files from all four discs as well all the install files in one temporary folder.

Burn a DVD with Nero, or whatever burning program you use. Label the disc ""FF8_Disc"". Burn all the files from your temporary folder onto this DVD.

Now if you don't wanna modify your redgistry (I DIDN'T MODIFY MINE TO PLAY) Place the DVD in your primary DVD Rom. It should prompt you to install, so do that now.

Once installed go to where it was installed to (Think it's C/Program Files/Eidos Interactive...etc) Now find the Play Final Fantasy.exe

Right click on it, then choose properties. On on of the tabs it should give you a compatibility option. Choose win98/me. also choose run in 640x480 screen resolution. Now when you run the game for the first time you should be asked to config options

Choose run in software rendered mode. (NOT Direct 3D) then also check the tabs at the top

LAST ONE IS CONTROL BINDING! READ IT. ""x"" will be your default ""enter/use"" key

i have click the INSTALL and the squaresoft and the installer shows 99% then it will be gone and it doesnt install.

,caladbolg28,2010-03-05T16:48Z,"im a little stumped here, i spent all of yesterday trying to get the game to work when finally i did at 1 in the morning. So i played for half an hour, saved it, all seemed fine then closed the program down. This morning when i decided to continue playing i got the ""wrong disc error"" yet again when i loaded up the save. i have done absolutely everything, changed the drive in regedit, created a new file for the .exe, put the .exe on the desktop, even created new files in the base drive for each disc and copied the ISO's into them and so on, everything and im now at the end of my tether with it, anyone have any ideas of what to do? because i checked on forums and message boards and all the infomation they give just doesnt work."
,EBelle,2010-05-15T14:20Z,"First of all, this is an amazing torrent. I am really psyched to play this game again. I had trouble finding my datadrive file, but with the help of ctrl-f, it was really easy. Just thought I'd let people know it works and that you can use find on the REGEDIT.
I'm going to be seeding this for a long time."
,FellowsPirate,2010-05-27T01:28Z," thought i would rack your brain if you wouldnt mind. So I made the registry fix so i could run the the disks from Deamon tools, and i completed they first disk without an issue, but when i try to mount disk 2 the game crashes, it says that FF8.exe has stopped working. I am using windows 7 but am running it with 98/me, resolution 400/600< 600/400> which ever, and 256 color. Any input would be appreciated

,Bean_head,2010-06-16T01:04Z,"No idea if i'm screwing something up? or did so with the installation or whatever, but i can get as far as ""Insert disc 3""

Loading disc 3 + 4 individually, and they are both recognised as disc 2...."

,nathan20,2010-09-20T22:04Z,WORKS GOOD !! Played it 3 times .. lol ..
,paedad,2010-10-10T10:57Z,"OK, i've dl:ed, installed it and extracted the files.

i hit start, then run, then type regedit, then press HKEY_local_machine, then software but i don't find Squaresoft! Please help me."
,mjzanga,2010-11-25T06:01Z,"I have the same problem! and its weird because i tried this once before with a different torrent, and it showed up then..."
,mjzanga,2010-11-25T06:46Z,"nevermind i got it to work! so for anyone having problems finding the key in regedit...
under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE would normally be the squaresoft folder. For me, it placed the folder in the Wow6432Node folder.  from there its Square Soft, Inc\FINAL FANTASY VIII\1.00.
also, im running this on Windows 7.  when i tried it before (as mentioned in my previous post) the computer had Vista on it.  possibly windows 7 handles the registry differently?"
,koiwai,2011-02-16T18:40Z,"To those who complain over graphics, try googling FF8 launcher 1.31 and get the winzip file from filecrop. It a ""patch"" that allows custom display, up to 2560x1920, though it helps mostly on character models."
,valkyrion055,2011-03-27T01:23Z,"Ok, I've been trying to install this game for some time now and no matter what I do it wont install it self. I get to the startup screen with install, direct x, read me and exit and when I click on install it shows the houglass for 5 seconds then it stops and nothing happens.
My computer has windows 7, 64 bits, is it compability problems or something else?
If you know either put a comment on it here or tell me on that email please: eternaldragon055@hotmail.com"
,tong_21,2012-03-06T17:45Z,how do i install this? im running vista ultimate 32 bit. please help i really want to play this game! :( i tried running daemon tools as admin and still when i press install nothing happens. i tried changing the compatibility of the setup.exe still nothing happens. please help :(
,BBlaze420,2012-07-18T06:00Z,This is one of those things that really made me scratch my head... I was reading along and some people had my problem but every other problem was discussed. I had the install CD mounted and I clicked on INSTALL and nothing was happening... The weird solution was to just do it in safe mode haha ... so easy as soon as I booted up in safe mode and then obviously did the reg edit shtuff ;) LOVE IT THANKS!
,bgrstaff3281,2012-07-31T15:08Z,"I was able to run it in my Windows 7 Pro 640bit pc. I extracted all files.  I used MagicDisc program. I mounted the Install Disc.  Then, I mounted what is inside the mounted Install disc. (***eye roll*** a disc image within a disc image - took me 3 hours to figure it out!!!). After I installed the program, I edited HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWARESquare Soft, IncFINAL FANTASY VIII1.00 using regedit.  I edited the ""default drive"" key to the drive letter of my emulated drive.

I then mounted disc 1 on my emulated drive... Everything worked fine then....  ***Geez!!!"
