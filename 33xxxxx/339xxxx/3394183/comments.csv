,Ragwing,2008-05-15T22:17Z,"Thank you for a nice and working upload!

For everyone that hasn't got it to work, here's how to do it:
1. Go to the download location and click 'CD1'.
2. Unrar the archive twk-bw2a.rar.
3. It should now've been unzipped into the folder twk-bw2a.
4. Repeat this step for each CD.
5. The folders with the unzipped files will be named twk-bw2a (CD1), twk-bw2b (CD2), twk-bw2c (CD3) and twk-bw2d (CD4).
6. For CD1, mount the file with the .mds-extension twk-bw2a.
7. Open the virtual drive and run setup.exe.
8. When installing, enter one of the serial numbers from here.
9. When prompted for CD2, mount the .cue file in twk-bw2b. For CD3, mount the .cue, and same for CD4.
10. When installation is complete. Run the patch (and tiger unlocker if you want).
11. Mount CD1 and start the game."
,PervisNC,2008-05-20T22:27Z,Thanks!  But why are there two copies of twk-bw2d... one in CD 1 and a rared version in CD 4?
,rydberg001,2008-05-31T17:26Z,it doesn't work with vista.. it freezes when u have chosen pet. 
,ComaKidInHell,2008-06-29T18:28Z,"Thanks for seeding! Keep it up! 
With this pase, I'll have it within about two hours. But, I read that this one doesn't work on Vista? Now I'm kinda scared, I have been downloading this one for three days, if it doesn't work...I'll cry. x)

Thanx!"
,Tapout25,2008-06-29T23:05Z,please seed 
,corbinik,2008-07-03T21:24Z,does this work for any other vista users???
,gopher663,2008-09-14T15:26Z,when you have vista you cant upgrade to XP. XP wont support the things that microsoft was doing with hardware. it wont work unless ur pc was originally XP. trust me. i tried. i asked a bunch of tech ppl and got the same thing from all of them.
,Fury112,2008-10-23T11:23Z,"are you sure gopher? I've never heard of that. If you delete your operating system completely, installing XP would have it's own way i think..?"
,michaeltje08,2008-12-19T17:02Z,can anyone explain to me what ''seed'' means?
,michaeltje08,2008-12-19T17:06Z,"oh ye, sorry i forgot : what does ''mount'' mean?

,thirtyseven10,2009-12-17T20:48Z,"I mounted the images and installed the game fine, but now when i try and load up the game it starts to load then freezes on the black and white (Not clours the name) screen, and then an error dialogue comes up asking me to eject and replace the disc and try again.
