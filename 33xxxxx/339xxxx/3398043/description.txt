Led by the late, great, Country Dick Montana and featuring the Reverend Mojo Nixon and the incomparable Dave Alvin, the Pleasure Barons laid waste to rock and roll convention. Call it cow punk, psycho-billy, or pure mayhem, this CD is a monument to what makes rock great. It will never happen again.  
The greatest supergroup never to be seen again. Perfect mix of drunken pyschos doing fantastic music that would make the clowns at The Rock and Roll Hall of Lame quake in their booties.
