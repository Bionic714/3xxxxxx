This is a capture of a video stream show a few guys in Wisconsin do sometimes. It's      
quite entertaining at times. Their site is at http://tkntv.thinking-kills.net/

From the README.txt I included:

"Cort and Ben are two guys from Wisconsin who host an Internet broadcast
called TKNTV (sometimes featuring Steve). I first found out about
TKNTV on digg.com, and proceded to paste the url to their stream on #thevoid
@ IRCNet."

And about the technical stuff:

"These were captured from the stream with 'mplayer -dumpstream' (authors are aware
of the capturing). I'm not quite sure what the container format is, but the codec
is just ordinary Windows Media. It plays ok in mplayer, so if all else fails, get
that..."

So far there's been about 5 shows and I've only missed one. I'll upload all the episodes I have once I can find the energy to make torrents :)
