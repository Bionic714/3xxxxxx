Before I had ever heard of ween, I heard their song, Bananas and Blow at a friend's place. I searched them up on PB and found this. I listened to it, and now, I am a HARDCORE Ween fan. I've downloaded a complete discography and listen to them 24/7.
They truly are the best band ever. Period."

Thanks and Legalize!"
