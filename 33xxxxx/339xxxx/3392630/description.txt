Styles: Hard Rock, Heavy Metal, Scandinavian Metal, Stoner Metal

After playing in a handful of metal acts around their native of Halmstad, Sweden, Joakim Thell, Tobias Nilsson, and Thomas Elenvik got together in 1996 to compose the '70s retro-metal of Blind Dog. With a hint of psychedelic touches to accompany their influences of Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, the three-piece went into the studio to record their debut full-length in 1999. With their added use of Hammond keyboards, film samples, and overdubbed instruments, The Last Adventures of Captain Dog resulted later on that same year through their own funding.
