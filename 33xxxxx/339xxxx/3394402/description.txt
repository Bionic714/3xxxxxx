Peterson, V. Spike 2003: 
"A critical rewriting of global political economy; integrating reproductive, productive, and virtual economies", Routledge 

***********************
Moving beyond a narrow definition of economics, this pioneering book advances our knowledge of 
global political economy and how we might critically rspond to it. 
 
Two features of the global economy increasingly determine everyday lives worldwide. The first is 
explosive ggrowth in financial markets that shapes business decision-making and public policy-making, 
and the second is dramatic growth in informal and flexible work arrangements that shapes 
income-generation and family well-being. These developments, though widely recognized, are rarely 
analyzed as inextricable and interacting dimensions of globalization. Using a new theoretical model 
Peterson demonstrates the interdependence of reproductive, productive, and virtual economies, 
and analyzes inequalities of race, gender, class, and nation as structural features of neoliberal 
globalization.

Presenting a methodologically plural, cross-disciplinary, and well-documented account of globalization, 
the author integrates marginalized and disparate features of globalization to provide an accesible 
narrative from a postcolonial feminist vantage point.

Keep on sharing, people!

LSC is a new re-releasegroup. Our goal is to re-release/re-seed .torrents which has died in the enormous informationflow on the internet.
We will never claim to have done any new releases, because that is not our goal.

We will work for emancipating knowledge for everyone, so that students and information-loving people will have full access to texts, ebooks and written knowledge in general, therefore we feel that it is necessary that somebody constantly re-seeds relevant material. Our primary target is danish students, which is why we have chosen to pre-fix all of our re-releases with "vidensdeling".
Vidensdeling.nu is a new danish site which tries to politicise the practise of students sharing knowledge, information and e-books by digital means. 
We encourage all danish users to support the project.


We will however will point out that we have *nothing* to do with Piratgruppen or Vidensdeling.nu, except for the common goal of keeping information free and available for everyone to share.
