Koobas - Barricades 1969
Includes the brilliant psychedelic monster "Barricades". Cut in '67, the album is pre-Move Brit-prog-psych-pop masterpiece w/a few loud highpoints. Those who think that Odessey And Oracle's a killer LP, better check this out and dig it! Very highly recommended! TheKoobas(originally The Kubas) began in Apr 1963. In Feb 1965 (while managed by Brian Epstein) Epstein arranged for The Koobas to be the support on nine dates of The Beatles' final UK tour in December.

They were formed in Liverpool in 1962 during the latter part of the Merseybeat boom and were managed by Brian Epstein. Ellis and O'Riley had previously been with The Thunderbeats. Morris and Leatherwood were in The Midnighters. Despite appearing in Ferry Across The Mersey and touring with The Beatles in 1965, none of their numerous singles for Columbia and Pye reached the Charts. They cut two confident singles for Pye: the first was a Kim Weston Motown track. In Spring 1966 they switched to EMI Columbia. Their final 45 was a quasi-psychedelic version of Cat Stevens' The First Cut Is The Deepest - it's quite good fun. They also recorded an album, which was very rare and sought-after, prior to its reissue. It features some fine lead guitar work, and contains some competent and usually R&B influenced mid-sixties rock. One of the best tracks, was the complex Barricades.

They also recorded as 45 as The Kubas in 1965 for Columbia. Keith Ellis went on to Van der Graaf Generator briefly. Stu Leatherwood was later in March Hare.
