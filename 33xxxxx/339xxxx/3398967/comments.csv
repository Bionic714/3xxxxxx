,Oscar_P92,2006-04-24T19:17Z,"Hahha,lol aidano ^^"
,jesperoland,2006-05-17T12:20Z,"That guy sure is retarded. His english is so slow that you would think it's an english course and not a spanish course.

It's hard to keep listening to this guy. His slow and retarted speaking makes everything take too long and ruins this course."
,m.kyung,2006-05-17T20:44Z,Michelle Thomas is awesome.
,m.kyung,2006-05-18T10:48Z,"The male student is just awful.  It's funny when Michelle corrects him, and he corrects him quite often."
,inuyasha-d00d,2006-05-25T21:15Z,rofl! michelle! lmao!
,inuyasha-d00d,2006-05-25T21:16Z, his names michelle?
,Nerd In Training,2006-06-30T02:04Z,"His name is Michel, not Michelle. Michel is French for Michael."
,LoserManMe,2006-07-07T11:58Z,"Muchas Gracias!

Michel Thomas demonstrates how you can convert many of the english words to spanish through slight alteration in the spelling and pronunciation.

Very Helpful for beginners!"
,CuZo,2006-07-16T16:05Z,Thanks for the work
,x_t_c_27,2006-07-30T23:54Z,I am seeding this right now so i hope everyone else can download it quicker than i did i even though i am on cable.  After I try it out i will write a comment about it
,Exorph,2006-11-05T00:53Z,"This thing is fantastic. I've spent about four hours listening to the two first cds twice and I already feel like I've learned more spanish in this time than I learned French during several hundreds of hours in school.

It's great that you don't spend an entire hour memorizing words for different animals or anything, you simply learn as you go and it's much more about scentence structure than different nouns.

If anyone have the advanced courses, upload them please! "
,dentman,2006-11-07T06:19Z,"This one sucks. I could only take a litle of it before blowing my brains out. Go for Rosetta Stone or Pimsluer.
Oh and my wife speaks spanish as her native tongue and she agrees he sucks."
,jen_jen,2006-12-04T19:03Z,Fungerar bra:) bra med repetitionen dom har.
,Bailarina,2007-04-27T15:17Z,"Yo thank you sooo much for this ul, jeeze I've been searching for this cd for a while now ^^"

,Dat_nammeR,2007-12-03T18:17Z,thanks for this.
,Dat_nammeR,2007-12-03T18:30Z,"I was looking for a Spanish learning software, saw some reviews on one called ""Tell me more Spanish"" which supposely got the best reviews for 07-08. Has anyone here ever heard or used it?"
,Actiment,2008-01-13T18:36Z,"The guy is an ass, the girl sounds nice tho ;)"
,ApeWare,2008-02-28T00:31Z,"Good quality torrent. Almost wish it was not so good, so I didn't have to listen to the dude constantly smacking his lips. Sounds like he is salivating.
Great torrent, great program, but the salivation on the recording is annoying."
,mosstrooperuk,2008-03-21T10:26Z,"They have now produced an updated Spanish version which has a revision disk in it that excludes the students efforts (who can be irritating when you listen to the course more than twice). 

Does any one have the revision disk? Will you please seed it if you have? Many thanks"
,cray1000,2008-03-31T01:59Z,"this is an amazing spanish set.  I am on disk 5 of 8 and i know more than i learned in 2+ years of spanish in high school.  

Its a total shame that Michael Thomas died last year, i would have totally paid to get his one on one lessons. 

The new version mentioned above has 10 CD's instead of 8, which is the 8 this comes with plus 2 review cd's with only michael thomas.  Does anyone have these 2 review cd's?

Also does anyone have or have the torrent for the language builder which is michael thomas only for learning after you finish this and the 5 disc advanced.    OR

the vocabulary builder which is by one of his teachers who is supposed to be descent, along with native speakers.

So we are looking for:

1) The 2 review cd's for this set.

2) The language builder w/ Michael Thomas

3) The vocabulary builder w/ his assistant.

Also if anyone has behind the wheel spanish, please post that too.  its supposed to go with this very well.

THanks!"

,lozory,2008-06-05T04:58Z,you can get all 4 courses here http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4222097
,Dark_Fire,2008-06-15T20:27Z,Audio book are great way to start though you might want to follow it up with Rosetta Stone
,heartlessangel7,2008-06-20T04:01Z,ARRRRGGH!!!! This guy's swedish...or whatever accent makes it F#%!ing hard to listen to!!!!
