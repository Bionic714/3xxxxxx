,PsyMinds,2008-06-19T10:37Z,"How to burn this to a DVD:

Create two folders and name them: ""VIDEO_TS"" and ""AUDIO_TS"". Move all the downloaded files into the ""VIDEO_TS"" folder, open Img Burn (or any other), and when you insert an empty disc, windows ask's what to do, then select ""Burn + Build Image"".

Then you open the audio_ts and video_ts into Img Burn, and press ""Write"" (button is a disc with a green arrow next to)"
