,IceHappy,2009-03-17T16:08Z,Thanks for the upload as Larry is not broadcasted where I live in order just random eps which is not how Larry wanted us to watch him:)  
,m33m33m,2009-05-02T00:46Z,"Thanks for this but the episodes skips once in a while, about 1 to 5 times per episode.
I'm using VLC as usual & it's the first time I ever get problem with videos downloaded from TPB.
Am I the only one?
Is there a way to repair those files?
Thanks!"
