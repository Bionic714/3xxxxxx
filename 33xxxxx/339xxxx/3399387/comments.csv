Just to let you know the file is already in xISO format so all you have to do is burn it to dvd! 

Works great and i'll be playing it for the next few weeks :)"

,Necrotech_the1st,2009-10-14T19:25Z,Actually using dvd2xbox 7.2 or greater resolves the file naming issues and allow full rips to the HDD. But you have to make a working iso first.
