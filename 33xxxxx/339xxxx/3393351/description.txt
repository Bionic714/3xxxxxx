"Hotsauce In The Dickhole"

Very few turntable crews on Earth would have the nerve to sell recordings of their everyday practice sessions to the general public. Not only did the oligarchy of Invisibl Skratch Piklz do this, they now have an entire series of their spontaneous late-night exploits for you to collect, trade, and cry over as you hopelessly attempt to be even half as good as they are. Tape #3 in this series removes the narration between sessions for a more continuous experience. But maybe you should get some air between theroutines anyway.
