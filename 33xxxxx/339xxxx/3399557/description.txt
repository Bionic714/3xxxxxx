Teleport Pro's big brother, Teleport Ultra, has Pro's intuitive interface and easy-to-use project-based design -- but it also has the ability to scan up to 250,000 addresses in a single project. Like Teleport Pro, Teleport Ultra can handle multiple servers in a single project, dramatically improving its throughput. Its larger database, however, allows it to handle much larger websites and more servers, enabling you to download much more information in a single project.
