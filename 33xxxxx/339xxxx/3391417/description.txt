Nadegas a Declarar is an absolute masterpiece of Brazilian rap: a sharp and witty satirical approach to an aspect - or preoccupation - of Brazilian culture: the 'buttification' (bundalização) by its 'cultura machista'. And an excellent way for learners of Portuguese to get in touch with informal and slang language. And even de title is a funny wordplay. Nádegas a Declarar, or 'Bottom to Declare', is a reference to Nada a Declarar ('nothing to declare'), and for the rest excellently covering the message of this song.
