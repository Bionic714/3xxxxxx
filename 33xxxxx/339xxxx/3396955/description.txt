?Information is the ultimate weapon,? this program proclaims. Based in New York City, Guerrilla News Network (GNN) is an independent news organization with a mission to expose young people to important global news and information free from corporate filters, through programming on the Web and on TV. GNN?s news videos are 5 to 10 minute documentaries combining high-impact images, commentary by media experts, scholars, and political leaders with music cuts by top recording artists like Peter Gabriel and the Beastie Boys. 

Ammo for the Info-Warrior features nine of GNN?s most compelling news videos ? covering a range of stories, from the violent diamond trade in Sierra Leone to the PR industry?s manipulation of public opinion to slam poetry about the business of hip-hop. The collection includes Crack the CIA, a controversial video examining CIA complicity in drug trafficking.
This innovative educational tool introduces serious socio-political issues to a generation brought up on MTV and will serve as an ideal catalyst for discussion and debate, encouraging students to develop skills in critical thinking.
