,lakerol1337,2007-07-15T22:27Z,just hafto say its funny that the one person ha made these remix dont even know that nr 2; gangsta paradise is made by coolio not 2pac LOL!
,teddybear1789,2008-03-31T18:06Z,No 2pac is really not the one who made that one. Lots of songs missing the one who made the songs. And I don't think Mulan made Kung Fu Fighting! =)
