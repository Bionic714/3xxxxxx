Maybe you should start reading somthing about it before talking shit again, somwhere else."
,CBAR,2006-09-01T01:40Z,"Could some one seed this? thankyou, please."
,CBAR,2006-09-01T03:08Z,"You guys are fantatsic! I didn't expect it to be that quick. Just finished downloading it.
Thanks very much."
,FlashGeezer,2007-01-01T16:06Z,"hohesG, why dont you just shut the fuck up?  How do you know WHAT this dude knows about programming?  C++ is an industry standard, platform independant language, while C# is some Microsoft bastard child for Windows -only development, and it's obvious by this guy's comments that he knows it. So who's talking shit now asshole?"
,TerekG,2007-01-14T00:52Z,"rrright. 
it's not like directx itself is ""some Microsoft bastard child for Windows-only development""... is it? :P"
,SneWs,2007-02-24T15:37Z,"What I mean with it's not ""Fucking C# and Managed Direct X"" is this:

No CLR and no managed garbage collection and no managed wrappers around everything to slow it down when you whant to write slim and fast code."
,tehArtist,2007-03-02T05:40Z,"By today's hardware standards. I would not be surprised if C# and Managed DirectX becomes the standard of GameDev before next-gen.

,dotwilson77,2007-03-05T23:11Z,"Thanks for the torrent man! And mate don't care about C# and the damn managed .Net stuff. It doesn't matter how popular this shit grows, because it grows only among amateurs and kids. The serious programmer will always want to squeeze those extra FPS from the machine to make the cutting edge app stick together. The managed code can be good for stupid people writing lame office application... No company is suicidal enough to try to make a commercial 3d product using C#, Java , Managed Direct3D , XNA or any other education tool for school-kids.  Java at least has the right of existence beeing platform independet, C# and co. is just fucking pathetic attempt to make up for the lack of imagination in bills head. Microsoft should keep doing what it does best: keyboards and mice."
,SneWs,2007-12-18T00:48Z,"I woudn't dream about even giving a thought, C# and Game development that is =)

Pure C or C++ and some asm is the way to develop good and efficient games.

If someone is going to complayn about my spellin, well, kind of drunk! ;)"
