,Osaka,2006-09-21T19:48Z,"On the (at least the japanese) Advent Children DVD, there's a video called ""Reminiscene of Final Fantasy VII"", which contains parts of the old game recorded, in order, like a film.

Making a movie of an entire FF game would be nearly impossible though, if you rush through the game without reading any of the text, you could probably get it down to 20~35 hours... and that would not be any fun to watch, and it would be way too long and take several months to encode and take thousands of gigabytes of space."

,Smokey_PhEoNiX,2008-03-07T08:24Z,"Cheers for this, I had all of them awhile ago, but a hard drive sadly died, great to see that it's still circulating, I'm more and more feeling like that we dont need a mgs film, the games are perfect as is and much better than most films"
