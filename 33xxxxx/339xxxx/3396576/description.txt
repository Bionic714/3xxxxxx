Charlize Theron plays the tormented protagonist and Christina Ricci plays the monster in this drama based on a true story about one of the few infamous women serial killers and her love for a sweet-looking young woman. 

I always find it intriguing to see that some actors really are able to play very different roles -- that you we're sure they're not always just playing out their own egos. Just think of Christina Ricci in Sleepy Hollow, with her doll-like porcelain beauty and her good heart, and compare that role with the one she's got in 'Monster'. While you may not agree with me that Ricci plays the monster here, but rather Theron, as people sometimes mindlessly take for granted, or even the ferris-wheel spoken of in the film, you may at least agree that Theron's character isn't the only one guilty of all evil presented here. Certainly, traits belonging to the society we all share and are responsible for also intervene.
