,EvilKidBugs,2006-04-04T02:12Z,"Just a quick note:
The difference between this torrent and the one called ""Bedouin Soundclash - 2 Albums"" at http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3376760 is that this one is MPEG-1 Layer 3 192 kbps 44100 Hz while the other is MPEG-1 Layer 3 VBR 44100 Hz

In other words, this one MAY sound a bit better
