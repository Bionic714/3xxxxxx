From IMDB: "Post-apocalyptic America. What begins as a con game becomes one man's quest to rebuild civilization by resuming postal service".  

Personal note: This can either be a really good flick or really bad, depending on the viewer.  I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks.

Quality is very good to excellent for DivX format.

I will seed as long as there is interest in this movie.
