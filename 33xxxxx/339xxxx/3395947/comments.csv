,Belmoridin,2008-06-19T09:54Z,"This is a god collection but a few notes:

1. Your version of Songs of Distant Earth is missing a track, track 16: Ascension.

2. The track Family Man on The Complete Mike Oldfield has a skip in it early on (so far all other songs seem good).

That being said, still a great collection, thanks :)"
,manofhood,2008-07-19T05:02Z," At the very least the singles not on any albums are missing, for instance Shine and Pictures in the dark.

 It's still an amazing collection, though."
