This is the documentary from Trio TV (Canada?), hosted by Janeane Garofalo.

Full title is: Bill Hicks - Outlaw Comic - The Sencoring Of Bill Hicks.

I was going to cut out the commercials, but I had no luck encoding it and so on. So if anyone else could do that and reseed it, I (and others IÂ´m sure) will be very grateful!

Enjoy, all you fellow Hicks fans!
