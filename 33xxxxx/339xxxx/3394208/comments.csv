,harabanar,2006-02-26T20:30Z,Hi is there something I donÂ´t get..? How am I going to use the txts that comes with the film. Is there some smart way of importing the txt to the film or do I have to do that manualy..?
,taxman_3,2006-03-21T04:42Z,"harabanar - it depends which program you are using to play the movie. If you're using VideoLAN, go to File->Open File     (Not 'Quick open file')

Then click the 'File' tab, then hit 'browse'. Now find the video you want to play. Then tick 'subtitle options' and hit 'settings', then browse and find the subtitle file, in this case, Prova d' Orchestra.ENG.srt

If using any other program, check the Read Me or the Help or something.

Hope that helps!
