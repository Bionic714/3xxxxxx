Description: An orchestra has assembled to rehearse covered by a television crew. The musicians are interviewed each extolling the superiority of his own instrument. The conductor arrives and the rehearsal begins. Being however displeased he shouts angrily at his orchestra making the musicians unwilling to follow his directions any further. After a short break he returns to find the oratorium a total chaos and the musicians in full revolt. An allegory about the contradictive nature of individual human character and the lack of harmony when each plays his own music oblivious of the man next to him.

There are some flaws(the picture goes blocky for an instant 3 or 4 times) in the video stream due to bad encoding in the original DVD but they don't affect overall quality much.
