In 1910, a group of international bankers secretly met on a small island off the coast of Georgia. Their plan: to formulate a program to destroy the financial structure of America. To do that, they pushed Woodrow Wilson into the presidency; and in 1913, Wilson signed into law, the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Income Tax. In 1921, these international bankers established the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). The U.S. Government took advantage of the CFR's experience in finance and foreign affairs, and one of their study groups, the Advisory Committee on Post-War Foreign Policy, became part of the State Department in 1941. The secret goal of this study group was to condition the Congress, and the people of this country to accept the establishment of the United Nations (UN). The UN, initiated in 1945, does not seek to promote world peace and cooperation- it was the first step towards a one-world government, which is now referred to as the New World Order.

The CFR is a subsidiary of the Round Table Organization, a group of British Elitists controlled by the most powerful family in the world- the Rothschilds, who, through an organization known as the Illuminati, have been controlling world events since 1776. The Illuminati controls world leaders and the money that runs their countries. They can elect a President, and they can kill a President. They can shut-off the oil, and plunge the world into war. Even though they operate under the strictest secrecy, their goals have been known for over 2,000 years.

This is the 2 hour 40 minute video from David Rivera's appearance on The Prophecy Club, where he covers the contents of his book by the same name. From the beginning of the Illuminti's involvement in the New World Order, to the present.
