"No other composer enjoyed as unanimously high a reputation across Europe during his lifetime as Johann Adolf Hasse. Bourgeois opera audiences worshipped him as fervently as crowned heads in Vienna, Dresden, Naples, Paris, London and Berlin. His music dissolved national frontiers and spanned two generations; the ink was still wet on Bach's Brandenburg Concerti as Hasse celebrated his first triumphs in Italy and by the time he put down his pen a young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart had taken up residence in Vienna.

Hasse's success was based upon his skill in writing for the voice: bel canto was for him the sine qua non of great music and to the beautiful display of lyric melody all else was subordinated. Only recently has he begun to be recognised as a founder of the Classical style, a reaction against the complexities of the seventeenth century.
