,elchup4cabra,2006-04-23T06:17Z,well it would be perfect but it apparently (or is it just me?) does not contain the one song I wanted the most...Advent: One-Winged Angel! Very sad :(
,Lord Genesis,2006-04-30T06:17Z,"Its there, the name is Sairin Katatsubasa No Tenshi. I had a problem extracting because of the character length. Just extract it right to the C:/ drive and it should all come out.
Also, very nice torrent."
,Bazzmon,2007-08-23T22:22Z,Seed plzz!!!
,thereaperd,2008-10-26T00:10Z,I finally have 100% of this torrent (after a month) and will be seeding it for some time.  Grab it while you can.
,Salibin,2009-04-04T09:42Z,"Thx all for seeding! As I dl, will seed for a month."
,thereaperd,2009-05-03T12:24Z,"Damn, something went wrong with my connection to the tracker.  I'm no longer able to seed.  Sorry.  (Well, seeding for 6 months with a 77.6 share ratio isn't half bad.)

If anyone else is able to seed, please do so."
