 |  Info:                                               |
 |     MathCad is a computer algebra system similar to  | 
 |     Mathematica, distributed by Mathsoft.            |
 |                                                      |
 |     It is oriented around a worksheet, in which      |
 |     equations and expressions are displayed          |
 |     graphically, as opposed to plain text.           |
 |                                                      |
