,Telordya,2008-05-17T01:53Z,"WARNING: this DVD isn't NTSC, it is PAL !! It doesn't work on most North American standalone DVD player. 

Download instead the http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3799774/The.Simpsons.Season.00.The.Tracy.Ullman.Show.Shorts-Boxset which include all the episodes in MPEG files."
,Telordya,2009-03-31T17:09Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3799774/The.Simpsons.Season.00.The.Tracy.Ullman.Show.Shorts-Boxset are all the same videos, and some better quality. This DVD should come from these videos. You're downloading more gigabytes for nothing, except a damn PAL DVD."
,ivarssonivar,2009-06-20T12:50Z,Nice and PAL is better quality than NTSC so thx.
,Daltonmenn,2010-06-14T03:49Z,"It took me 15 days to get this whole thing downloaded. I will seed at 10mbps but you have to promise to seedafter you download it. I have Comcast, and a bandwidth cap keeps me from seeding forever."
