All 48 The Simpsons Shorts from the Tracy Ullman Show on one DVD disc

"The Tracey Ullman Show" was a half hour music/comedy/variety show on FOX starring Tracey Ullman herself. For the most part, the series served as a platform to showcase Ullman's ability to do characters and every show featured various comedy and musical skits. It also occasionally featured various amusing animated shorts. One series of shorts stood out and soon became the exclusive animated series on the show. That series was called "The Simpsons." The characters in the shorts were voiced by the show's cast members (Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Yeardley Smith, and Nancy Cartwright) and eventually every episode of Ullman's program would have three Simpsons shorts linked by a common plot such as Bart going to get a haircut. The art slowly changed as well, as the Simpsons seen in the first shorts look like only rough sketches of what the characters eventually became. When "The Tracey Ullman Show" finished a four season run in 1990, "The Simpsons" was reborn as a full-length show and became the driving force behind FOX's growth into a major network.
