Life on a Stick is a funny show that premiered in March 2005,
but was yanked off the air after only 5 episodes.

This is episode 7, with the rest to follow. The first 5 eps
will also soon be released in the same format as this one.

Each episode is 340 MB, because there are 13 episodes in the
season. Work it out.
