,joshuag942,2009-10-11T23:17Z,u stupid bastard. flac is the highest possible quality.
,tommiel,2009-11-12T11:59Z,"Ripped properly ie with EAC T&C etc etc ( http://xs.vc/eac/index.html ) FLAC is the best format. You play it through various media players usually using plugins or through VLC.
You can also re-burn the files with various programs, Nero (With a plugin), EAC (the best), or Burrrn to name a few.
Keep it up guys x"
