A truly great movie. James is a Christian, on a pilgrimage for his village to the Holy Land. Who lives in the Holy Land? What do they worship? He soon finds out. As he says (twice) - the people in my village would never believe me if I told them about this place - they would get angry at me. An up-to-date view of the Holy Land with a timeless story. This movie is perfect, and could not have been made better. There are no preachy political lessons here - we are dropped into the middle of chaos along with James, and we learn as he does how to get along. We see nothing of Palestinians - only Israelis and guest workers. James is a Christian in the land of the Jews, and the Holy Land is not what he was expecting. The plot flows well and the ending is exciting and surprising, with plenty of ups and downs.
