Capitol Records promised Brian Epstein that 1964 would be the year of The Beatles in America? ?and they certainly kept their word.

Beatlemania swept America on the back of a brilliantly onceived and executed compilation album Meet the Beatles, a live telecast to American cinemas and four key appearances on the Ed Sullivan TV show.

By April 1964 Beatles singles occupied all five top positions on the Billboard chart, a feat that has never been equalled.
