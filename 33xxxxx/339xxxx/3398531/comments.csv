Haven't checked out the quality yet and will post after the download is complete to let you know.  But based on the file size the image and sound should be sufficient.

Thanks again"
,majesty74,2006-01-03T20:58Z,Cant get the individual files to extract. Any ideas?
,majesty74,2006-01-03T21:14Z,Nevermind...Got it.
,Patrick5763,2006-01-10T12:10Z,Unfortunately one or more of the files appears to be corrupt in some way.  Although the Ultra ISO IMG archives are fine individually.

,brerlapin,2006-05-19T21:44Z,I couldn't get this to work. They played individually as VOB files but their in pieces. I don't know how to assemble VOB's without an IFO.
