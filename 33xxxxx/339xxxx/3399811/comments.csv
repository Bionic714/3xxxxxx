,RockyWoodR,2007-08-17T23:28Z,"I'm a Mac-User...not cutting edge equipment, so I've been ""searching-out"" this slightly older version of TOAST (v6) to use with my B&W G3 and an external DVD writer to hopefully assemble a compilation of still pix and some video of my daughter's (and new son-in-law's) wedding that occurred upon their return from IRAQ (both in the US Army)...GREAT to have them back in the 'ole USA. ?Hopefully I'll be successful at the download (been frustrating so far_not sure what I'm doing wrong), but then (optimistically), I'll be able to create something memorable for them. I'll attempt to find a piece  of software that deserves to be ""uploaded"" to TPB site for others to take advantage of. Thanx in advance (w/fingers-crossed)!?  "
