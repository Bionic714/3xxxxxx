Is there a Menu on this?
And where can I find a cover?"
,Patton2,2006-03-28T16:30Z,is there a menu and extras on this or is it removed to make the movie quality better?
,zap.514,2006-04-18T11:54Z,"kimble84  before you can burn this in to a  cd you will have to unrar the files ,, most probably there will be a so called Image file left , delete all other rar files because you wont need them anymore and then burn the image with Nero Burning rom."
