The OhmForce Experience

A neat collection of VST plugins by the french guys behind OhmForce. For use with any audio host program capable of using VST plugins. Have some very innovative and wicked interfaces, but first-class sound modulation under the shell.

I've also included a .pdf manual for the plugins, be sure to visit www.ohmforce.com for more information. Price: 299 EUR (so you save a lot of cash ;)
