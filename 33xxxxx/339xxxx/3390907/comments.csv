,Stratus01,2006-01-24T10:34Z,"Could it be that it is originating from NTSC, and not converted to PAL on the right way?
Idd. .. moved the game on to the HD from your Xbox????  What when you start it direct from disc?"

copy the media folder back into your game's dir. if
in fact it was taken out by the ""hacked"" default.acl

From ""overfiend"" at X-S."

,ubercam,2008-01-15T21:10Z,"would someone please be so kind as to seed this for about a day? i'm stuck at 99.1% so it'd only take about an hour at most to complete. I know it's an old game but nevertheless... someone's gotta have it still.

thanks"
