,pr00nf4ce,2006-03-14T11:25Z,"Tracks on Plastic Fang, Acme Plus and Damage are full of gaps. Didn't download Orange as had it already, but it's a shame, as they are great records."

,shrill,2006-03-26T21:08Z,Could someone please seed
,jens-peter,2006-04-28T21:09Z,These albums ROCK
,Shunter,2006-07-29T10:16Z,"Top notch effort, mate!

More seeders would be good, but it's just a bonus to actually find it. Had all of these albums once, but they were lost to car burglary. Bastard!

 Still would really appreciate 'Extra Width' and 'Acme' (original, not the remix) albums if anyone is hip to it.

I will happily seed most requests in return. My collection is extensive."
