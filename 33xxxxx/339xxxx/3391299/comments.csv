ITS CALLED GAMECOPYWORLD
http://www.gamecopyworld.com once you get on there select the mirror suitable to you and then look at the right hand side then click n-s and then find rome total war barbarian invasion on that page.
Once you have done that choose the crack that is the correct version of barbarian invasion and then replace the game executable with the one in the archive."

FOR F**K SAKE SEED THIS BLUDDY GAME
I MEAN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD WHATS SO WRONG

YOUR POKETS OR ASK YOUR PARENTS TO DO IT
AND BUY AN ADSL2 MODEM OR SOMETHING IT
COST AS LITTLE AS $30 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA
AND MAKE SURE YOU GO FOR A PLAN WITH NO
EXAGE CHARGE FOR EXCEEDING LIMIT AND JUST GO
FOR SOMETHING THAT SLOWS YOU DOWN
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD YOU WERE PROBABLY USEING DIAL UP ANY WAY"

,Galltiger,2008-08-25T00:42Z,"Pleace people! Stop bitching about seeding. I don´t think anybody listens to it anyways.
Try increasing your upload speed to about 2/3 of Ur download speed (It helps a lot), and don´t have to many tasks going at once. Also.. Search for downloads with many seeders, and U should have no problem in getting decent speeds. (Unless Ur using a crappy dialup modem of course. In that case there is nothing much U can do but investing in some broadband/fiberoptics) 
Good luck, and don´t forget to reseed when Ur done downloading."
