I'm using Cubase LE 4 and it says ""could no find any waves plug ins, please reinstall waves plug ins to use wave shell"". What does that mean? I've uninstalled and reinstalled and keep getting the same thing. Anyone know how to fix it?"
,charlesruiz_2000,2011-01-21T18:46Z,"I seem to have found out a way to fix the problem in Cubase for this by forum hunting.
-go to run
-type regedit
-find HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Filter
- right click on the folder and click PERMISSIONS
- then u have to allow the authorizations, also u may try to go on advanced-owner and change the owner...i did both of these but i dont know what made everything work"
