    The L3 comes in two  versions: the Multimaximizer?, which includes  all 
    of the features listed above, and the Ultramaximizer? , which uses  the 
    same  PLMixer?  but  offers  limited  controls.  With  its  transparent 
    operation, brick-wall limiting, extreme  tonal range and dithering  and 
    noise shaping  control, the  L3 can  function as  a complete  mastering 
    processor.
