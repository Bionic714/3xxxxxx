,Xenif,2007-07-25T14:08Z,"Alright, those of you asking about CD 4: That's the sims 2 updater, you need to mount the sims 2 CD 4 image, or your DVD. Those of you who don't know how to use Daemon tools, you have a very healthy dose of stupid. Seriously, It's not hard. At all. Right click on the icon, go to virtual CD/DVD rom, then at the left there should appear a window, with G: nothing mounted or something similar. Click that, find the iso/cue/mdf you just downloaded, click it. It should say please wait... and a bit later the autorun should pop up.

For those asking about CD keys, you people are REALLY lazy. Search on google, OR, LOOK IN THE DAMN TORRENT!

It's not hard, people. Takes about 2 minutes of trial and error to do it. Instead of asking here, you could google for tutorials or CD keys. Figure things out for yourself for once.

,livlena,2010-06-23T03:50Z,"Hey people, 

No one sent me the install steps..sadly, but I figured it out all by my self! Haha, I'm really proud. ANyway...I don't quite remember what I did but follow these steps. 

You have to have: Deamon tools installed. When or if you have downloaded it follow this; 

Right click on the icon(deamon tools, in the corner) and go to virtual devises CD/DVD room, then at the left there should appear a window, with F: nothing mounted or something similar. Click that and go to Nightlife folder that you just downloaded and click: folder 1. (You should probably select show all files) Find the file that is iso/cue/mdf that you just downloaded. It should say please wait... and a bit later the autorun should pop up. Run the autorun and then write in the password. The password should be in one of the file you downloaded, if you can't find it, google it. Then wait till the download starts. After a bit it will stop and say you need disk 2 or something. 

Go right away again go to virtual devises CD/DVD room, then at the left there should appear a window, with F: something mounted. Click that and go to nightlife folder 2 and mount iso/cue/mdf. 

If the download starts again, it worked and you mounted the right file. If it doesn't, then try mounting the other file that is iso/cue/mdf. 

After the download has finished, click on some other game but not the Nightlife icon. You should be able to play it!  

Remember to right click on some other sims game you have and right click; run with administrador. I don't know why your suppose to do it but just do it. Hehe. 

I really hope that I helped but I tryied like billion times to do this. Good luck.

"
,livlena,2010-08-30T16:43Z,"Hey Norbert_JAM,

Hmmm... It happened to me too. If it says it has crashed, you should check if you have enough space on your computer. If you do or don't: You can try to delete some useless programs and stuff that you have in your computer and you don't need. Can be old computer games that you don't play anymore and you uninstall them or whatever! Restart your computer and then try to play the game. Don't have any programs open when you are going to play the game, because it takes space when you're playing the game and slows it down which may cause the game to crash.

i mount the CD1/CD2, after this i install the CD1 and its stop at 57% and ask me to insert CD2, so i try to open the AutoRun link in CD2, but it won't open!!
what can i do???"
,st0rm420,2012-03-21T14:12Z,Umm @ Mrof after mounting CD 2 just click okay on the installation process. And as far as everyone else yelling how there is no CD4 when it asks to update at the end of the installation what their asking for isn't CD4 for Nightlife (which don't exist) their asking for the 4th CD of the core game (The Sims 2). The original game had 4CD's. And you don't have to worry about updating it won't mess with your crack or anything. I updated mine when I installed University and now every other expansion I install it just says game is already up to date and finishes installation. No need to restart computer like in Sinisters install guide. but otherwise follow his guide exactly and you will be just fine.
,st0rm420,2012-03-21T14:15Z,Oh @ Mrof just saw you said you mounted both CD's to begin with. Then hit okay as soon as it asks for the 2nd CD. If it is saying you don't have it in try remounting it. If that fails you may need to re-download this torrent as something might have messed up when downloading and there is an error in your 2nd CD.
,Fact1ons,2012-06-09T10:39Z,Do i need to install the orig. Sims 2 for this torrent?
