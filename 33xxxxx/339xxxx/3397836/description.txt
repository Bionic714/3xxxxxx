I've been receiving requests lately from people who have wanted this awesome game soundtrack, composed by Frank Klepacki, the creator of the Command and Conquer music.  And so here it is--the whole deal, every last song and background theme in the game, including quite a number that never made it into the finished product... the game is dead, but the music is not!
