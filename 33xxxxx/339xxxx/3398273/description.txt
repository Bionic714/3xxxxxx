Trivia: Due to quarrels whether this should be a social realistic film or a family film and the last of the two options won, a key scene had to be cut; it featured Torben's lawyer, Jannik (played by Kim Sønderholm Andersen) and Malene's lawyer Lisbeth (played by Maj-Britt Mathiesen) in a struggle over their clients divorce. This scene was deemed inappropriate for a family film, therefore cut, but it will be among the bonus material on the DVD when released in the fall of 2005. (more)
