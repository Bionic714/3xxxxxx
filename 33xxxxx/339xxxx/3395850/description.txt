Enter an all-new Evil Dead experience, as Ash finds himself
arrested, convicted of murder, and sentenced to Sunny Meadows,
an institute for the criminally insane. Though better than the
madness he escaped hidden within the woods, he quickly learns 
the evil has only become more malevolent. Deep in the basement
of an insane asylum, the mad Dr. Vingo Reinhard combines     
technology with The Book of The Dead, AKA The Necronomicon to 
fulfill perverted experiments of his very own. Hell-bent on   
using science to harness the Necronomicon's powers, the       
malevolent doctor unleashes the book's all-powerful Evil on the
world - creating a new breed of Deadites, monsters and       
experiments gone wrong, twisting reality into a hellish strudel
and leaving mankind with that not-so-fresh apocalyptic feeling.
