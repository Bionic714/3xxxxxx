It saves all your documents, music, photos, videos online for you to access  securely from any computer connected to the internet. It can even back-up a whole drive. Using it for 2 years, never let me down. I strongly recommend Mozy. Plus,you get 2GB of storage for free. You can sign up for Mozy  here: https://mozy.com/?code=J4MTDK"
