Hilarious, seriously weird Japanese live-action movies (also known as Keiko Mask) based on a manga, about a female superhero that fights injustice by flashing her vagina at her foes. Here are the IMDB descriptions of these two movies:

Sadly, neither is subtitled. Actually, that's probably a good thing.

This is my first torrent upload, so please bear with me if I screwed it up. I'll check the comments regularly, and seed for a couple of weeks. Enjoy.
