B.B. King - Live At The Regal - Spotlight On Lucille

If you only have place for two albums of B.B. King in your collection, I'll vote for these two:


'Live At The Regal' - a live performance from 1964. One of the greatest live blues albums

'Spotlight On Lucille' - a collection of B.B. King trademark instrumentals from around 1960



B.B. King singing or playing the blues, here you'll have a lot of both, at his very best.
