Two of this generation's most respected hip-hop artists, Danger Mouse and MF Doom have come together for this album, inspired by Adult Swim, Cartoon Network's popular late-night animation network. Doom, with his near obsession with masked identities and superhero personas, and Mouse, with his murky, ethereal soundscapes that cloud men's minds like Mandrake, are the perfect partners for the project, and each has inspired the other to the finest work of their careers. "The Mouse & The Mask" contains character voices and skits from Adult Swim's most popular original shows, including "Aqua Teen Hunger Force", "Sealab 2021", and "Harvey Birdman, Attorney At Law", along with guest appearances by Cee-Lo, Talib Kweli, and Ghostface Killah.
