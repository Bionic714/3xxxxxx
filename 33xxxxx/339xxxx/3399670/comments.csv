,kola65,2006-01-07T21:33Z,"I agree this is a great sci-fi serie!
I have a question about another serie, what day do stargate Atlantis air?
The last episod i'v got is S02E14, but it's not Fridays?
I'v had that episod a few days b4 that?
Well, BG is better anyway:-)"
,Hilamonsta,2006-01-09T04:20Z,"Hey all, I'd just like to let everyone know that episode 10 in this torrent that is labeled as ""Ressurection Ship"" (ep11), is actually ""Pegasus"" (ep10).  If you are looking to see Ressurection Ship - Part 1 before Part 2 airs this friday don't bother with this because it'll only be waste of time.

Other than that, it's a great torrent.  Thanks for the share."
,Phife,2006-01-09T06:05Z,"Do us a favor, don't upload until you have all episodes in the future, the last two are missing and that's lame."
,Hilamonsta,2006-01-09T17:59Z,"The 2nd to last one is missing, the last one hasn't aired yet dude."
,*Nyiz*,2006-01-11T17:28Z,"Question: Anyone noticed, that the episode titled ""Final Cut"" is actually ""Home, part 2""? I have that problem, do you?"
,Phife,2006-01-14T02:20Z,"""The 2nd to last one is missing, the last one hasn't aired yet dude.""

My apologies.  I saw season 2 is 12 episodes long, but only 10 have come out.  (Well, now 11).  I find it odd that they would release a DVD of Season 2 without the final 2 episodes.  That is what is really lame lol."
,klepman1971,2006-01-15T13:03Z,"hiya all.

season 2 has 20 episodes.
and season 3 is in production

greets and respect from amsterdam"
,Sleminator,2006-01-29T19:34Z,"Nice torrent. Although it hasn't got the entire season, it's an easy way to catch up. :)"
,nuffi,2006-02-06T16:30Z,lol there ar 20 episodes on season 2 just lock at www.tv.com
,arm4n,2006-02-06T22:36Z,"Well its good knowing that the Ep10 here is the ""pegasus"" coz no other torrent has pegasus except this one...thanx !!"
,MousePad,2006-02-10T13:22Z,"Not that I don't appriciate the upload (I do) but Galactica sort of SUCKS, big time. (someone said ""sorry trekkies this is the best show ever - or something like that).

Teleplay is awful. There's no structure. It doesn't make any sense. It's stupid.

The acting is good though.

Try Farscape. Farscape is the best sci fi show, EVER."
,patoalexis38,2006-02-26T21:53Z,"Hi,

Many thanks in advance.

,Hei_på-deg,2006-03-10T17:13Z,is season 2 finished?
,macness234,2006-03-15T01:32Z,"Great Show... Great Torrent... I consider this somewhat more of a ""military drama"" more than sci fi.  But I have no problem with that.  Season 2.0 was 10 ep im sure ""2.5"" will be the others in the series. "
,Sith1ord,2006-03-22T02:12Z,"This torrent is Season 2 first half only...  and Season 3 is October 2006 I believe.
""The show has received a full 20 episode Season 3 order, that they may begin filming as soon as February 2006. This may be aired in late Summer 2006 on the Sci-Fi Channel.""
"
,shinobiung,2006-09-22T11:32Z,"American crap. This is NOT Battlestar Galactica, they have stolen the franchise name and RUINED IT.

Think what ENTERPRISE did for Star Trek, THIS is even WORSE. For the 13 hours, you get to see the Cylons for about 1% of the time. The special effects are virtually non-existent. Its mostly people standing around talking, sitting around talking or some standing some sitting around talking. They try to attract a bigger audience with sex appeal, guys, stay away from Sci-Fi and go into porn if thats your thing.

Really a travesty to the Battlestar '70s series and film."
,allmypeople,2006-12-07T17:14Z,"Ahahaha Ignore the idiot above me. Find me ONE reputable critic that agrees with what you said you twit.

The new BSG is a multi-layered, beautifully produced and acted tv masterpiece.

This show is one of VERY VERY VERY FEW scifi shows that maintain an ""Empire Strikes Back Cool"" throughout the entire series. It's dark, complex and THRILLING. 

The original was a stupid, poorly-acted, terribly directed, sexist piece of garbage. The only reason to check out the old show is for a good laugh because it honestly provides many."
[T],Knaster,2006-12-18T19:39Z,shinobiung you make absolutly no sense at all now take your pill like a good boy and go back to drooling!
,vixen-of-alcatraz,2009-01-10T18:39Z,Now Now ladies...
,adventurjunky,2009-03-10T21:30Z,"Calm the fuck Down!
This is a good show but what I dont get is why Mig welders,welding masks,Cable Jacks just to mention a few havent technologicaly advanced!
BIATCH!"
