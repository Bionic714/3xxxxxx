In about a month I m gonna have a new connection (still slow, but unlimited traffic...), so if you re interested send me an email to koshman@seznam.cz to remind me and I ll up it by then."

Its 2.57GB though!

Anyone downloaded this and can confirm its quality? ive already downloaded another CD version of GK1 only to be disappointed by a hasty job."

It does work, I've tried it myself.

However, this particular version is very unstable and riddled with bugs, such as being unable to save the game in most areas (causing an immediate crash to desktop) and when you CAN save (for me, the only place I could successfully save was gabriel's office/bedroom) the game crashes after the save is successful.

There are also a number of places (such as cemetary #1) where you cannot leave once you've entered them, despite clicking the ""exit"".

I wouldn't recommend downloading this torrent if you actually want to play the game in its entirety."
