Release Notes:

Former Run-DMC member Reverend Run has announced the completion of his
first ever solo album, Distortion.

The album was produced entirely by Run and Whiteboy. The first single
from the album, "Mind On the Road," will be featured in EA Sports√Ü
popular football title, "Madden 2006."

Run, born Joseph Simmons, is the younger brother of Hip-Hop mogul
Russell Simmons.

Russell Simmons recently launched a new label, the Russell Simmons
Music Group, which is distributed by the Island Def Jam Music Group,
a Universal company.

Simmons managed Run-DMC before founding pioneering Hip-Hop label, Def
Jam Records along with partner Rick Rubin in 1984.

"Timing is everything," Russell Simmons said in a statement. "The
uncompromising loud abrasive rock and roll hip-hop of Run-DMC knocked
open the doors to commercial freedom for the rap generation. Their
very best efforts were big in the streets and were ahead of their
time when it came to the mainstream. The debut album from Rev Run,
Distortion, is honest, creative, special, refreshing, and still
incredibly commercial. The time is now for Rev Run."
