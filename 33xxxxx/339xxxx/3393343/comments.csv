,choron,2006-01-21T05:09Z,"The official page for Suse 10.0 says you can only download driver or software updates if you have the Enterprise ($$$) edition, bastards. I will keep up with Mandriva then."
,ICDeadPpl,2006-01-21T20:18Z,"DonÂ´t know what you mean, because you can update software in SUSE 10.0 with the YAST program.
You can also update programs with smart..."
,jefffisher,2006-03-03T08:42Z,does it fit on a regular verbatim dvd-9 i can buy at the store?
,jefffisher,2006-03-04T06:38Z,nevermind it filled it exactly
,Dark_Templar_PhOeNiX,2006-04-04T15:10Z,is this de 64bit version?!?!?
,lleb,2006-04-05T19:13Z,"um, Dark the discription states clearly that this is for both the 32bit and 64bit vs of SuSe 10.  Since 9.3 all of the DVDs for SuSe have been for both 32 and 64bit vs.  IIRC that is.  also for not being able to update software without the enterprise edistion you are wrong Choron.  as stated below you Yast is what is used for updates.  now for UPGRADES that may be what you were thinking about.  that means from 10 - 10.1 and so on."
,Dark_Templar_PhOeNiX,2006-04-07T06:59Z,"32bit and 64 bit!
excellent!"

,sarah_j,2006-05-13T05:29Z,"Ok sorry that this might sound dumb, but I downloaded the file and unrared it. Tried burning it but it doesn't work. Can anyone help?"
,jefffisher,2006-05-16T05:03Z,"are you using a dvd-9, is your burner dual layer compatible, those would be the two most obvious problems"
,dreamspirit,2006-06-25T13:41Z,"Is this the dvd from the box. Because i bought the box but my dvd is now not more readable.
Second is this dvd-download multilingual.

Thanks
"
,ICDeadPpl,2007-03-29T15:55Z,"As it its an ISO file, you must not unrar it!
Just start Nero or ImgBurn or whatever and select ""Burn image""."
,lliptak,2007-06-27T22:19Z,the checksum is at open source suse 10.0
