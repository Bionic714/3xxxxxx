Anyways, we'll be posting a new version of the unsubtitled film packed with subtitles in some 20+ languages sometime in the future when all is well.

Right now we're ridiculously busy on making a teaser for our next film for Cannes.

And the short films from one to five are available from http://www.starwreck.com/legacy/movies.php"
