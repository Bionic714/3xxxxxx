Plot:

Winner of the Audience Award at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival.

In the early hours of the New Vietnam, four strangers in Saigon find themselves suddenly expatriates in their own country, passed over by the "improvements" of Western progress. As the hauntingly beautiful old city of Saigon fades into the shadows of neon lights, Coca Cola signs, plastic lotus flowers, and other symbols of the Western invasion, these characters' paths begin to cross. 
Stories merge to paint a portrait of a country in transition, the last moments of a culture which, through a second invasion by its former enemy, will never be the same again; Kien An is a living memory of the old ways, living a life seemingly unchanged by the passage of time; Lan has reinvented herself as someone who can survive in the cold-hearted capitalist world; Hai bridges the two worlds on his cyclo; James Hager is a reminder of the country's ravaged past; and young Woody is a symbol of its future.

Breathtakingly beautiful, 2 April 1999

This film is sheer poetry! The three seasons are actually three vignettes, interpersonal connections which all touch the others in strange and moving ways. (Harvey Keitel is moving as a VietNam war vet who has returned to search for his Amerasian daughter.) The use of flowers and color as metaphor for the "opening" of VietNam after the war is truly striking. Don't miss this film.
