,Buddzilla,2006-05-07T03:34Z,"It's not downloading, someone help me out here. I need stuff!"
,damage.com,2006-05-26T20:31Z,"OK--I'm seeding, I see 4 peers, and I can't connect with them because the tracker is down...
If you are d/ling this and can't connect to me, please get uTorrent and enable the DHT--you should connect to me just fine after that. 
Sorry for the inconvenience!"

Thank you again!!!"
