This is a copy of ZimPhony--the 5-hour broadcast of ZiM music and interviews, which aired on the Internet radio show Anime Stuff R. Only 100 of these mini-discs were ever issued. The hordes of Zim fans who missed out were left soaking their pillows with bitter tears. It also made the ZiMPhony disc a sort of Rolex watch--a pearl of great price, possessed by the priveleged few. 

Yeah well, enter the pirate. :) 

This broadcast includes much more music than the ZiM promo disc--5 hours and 325 files. The drawback to this recording is, it isn't what you'd call 'audiophile' quality--all the songs are 64 kbps. 

HOWEVER-- 
1) It never was audiophile quality, as I understand it--it was low-bandwidth streaming audio formulated for broadcast over the Internet. 
2) It still sounds damn good--just turn the bass up a bit, and
3) It has songs called "Toilet Horrors" and "Lice-A-Roni". GOOD GRIEF, MAN!  

The broadcast groups the music of ZiM into blocks according to episode, contains a few "Station break" tracks, and a 22-minute interview with Kevin Manthei. The torrent also has 2 .JPEG scans of the mini-disc insert and the disc itself.
