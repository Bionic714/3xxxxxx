Gruppo di famiglia in un interno (Conversation piece)
1974
Luchino Visconti

Burt Lancaster as the professor
Silvana Mangano
Helmut Berger
In the professor's memories: Dominique Sanda, Claudia Cardinale

The professor lives alone, amidst art and paintings. 'Crows fly in flocks, the eagle soars alone', but tenants drive a wedge in his solitude. Movie about human relations, frailty and illusions. To my taste Lancaster's best role, Berger's too. Mangano's splendid, as usual. The 'interno' is a visual feast, as we'd come to expect from Visconti.
