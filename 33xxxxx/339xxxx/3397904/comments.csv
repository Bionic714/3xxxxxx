,Cinquetto,2006-03-16T10:36Z,Thanks for this! I recommend to all viewers - you should listen to the new soundtrack by the Cinematic Orchestra while watching this!
,billykid55,2006-04-12T13:41Z,"This is one of the best films ever!

Demonstrates what film couldve become instead of what it is..."
,lorenzo_K,2006-07-10T13:51Z,"1st of all - thanks for postin this! : )

2ndly, which musical score is it? ...seems to me like there are (atleast) 3 different ones. one by michael nyman, one by the cinematic orchestra, and one by the alloy orchestra(?).

anyway, great post! lookin forward to watchin it! : )"
,lorenzo_K,2006-07-14T22:35Z,"yeas! : D - once again: THANK YOU! still havent watched it, but surely lookin forward to it!

and to the rest of you who (also) didnt get which musical score it is (and has yet to d/l it) - the cinematic orchestra, which is nuff said. in other words, the music is absolutely fabulous!"
,envelope,2007-01-13T23:20Z,"I'm surprised none of you mention the exemplary soundtrack composed by musique concrete legend Pierre Henry available as titled: ""L'Homme a la Camera"".   The manner in which the two are synchronized is but a guess although the first time I tried it went *very* well.  Movie on player with music on winamp.  Listen in open space (no headphones, real speakers) if possible.   "
,envelope,2007-01-19T19:57Z,"I recently took the time to figure out the Henry soundtrack synchronization point.   Hit play at about 02:07 when the projection camera comes on screen.  The soundtrack is 1:12:52 long;  the film has about 4-5 seconds of non-original film content (production release company) at the end which shifts the soundtrack initiation point from 02:12 to the mentioned 02:07.   To micro-manage the synchronization you can take note of one further point:  less than 20 seconds after 02:07 there is a busy surge in the music which should correspond to the waiting crowd being let into the theatre (appropriately urges the phrase ""let the bees in!"").  Enjoy!      "
,digitaldevil,2008-01-10T05:19Z,"Thankyou for this torrent, I need to see this film for a class and this saved me a LOT of serious bother. THANKS!!!!"
,raheesen,2008-07-26T22:07Z,good quality...great movie(documentary)...thanks...
,Waldoh,2009-03-12T22:48Z,"I don't know why nothing mentions this, but this Torrent has the Cinematic Orchestras soundtrack already synced with the movie! Great Music to go with some Urban footage of 1929 Russia, as far as people saying the special effects are amazeing, well they might have been the first to do it but the idea is simple and compared to todays effects its nothing. Just nice to watch with it was like back then and listen to some good music. PS: works well with psycadelics. I fell into this whole Universal Organic way of thinking from the movie was was realy moved by the beauty that is life"
,Torgaloukos,2009-09-21T15:32Z,"Thanks!

,britt0,2009-11-18T23:50Z,"Thank you SO much for this!

,FRivera,2010-09-17T21:46Z,"no, this torrent doesnt have shit synced with the movie. the movie is silent and 1:10 and there's two 5 minute mp3 files with it. W T F"
,FRivera,2010-09-17T21:52Z,"nevermind, only the first 3 minutes are silent:D10x 4 the UL!!"
,sardone,2011-01-09T12:51Z,Pleeease seed! This movie is necessary to my life...
,sardone,2011-01-09T23:34Z,"Okay, my clients telling me that i have an ""unregistered torrent pass"" on my hands... Help?"
,BiffyBiro,2011-03-12T03:03Z,"Thanks for seeding this. (: I need it for my university film course and I (through lack of sleep the night before...) feel asleep on the person next to me during the original screening of it.. idiot, I know. Would anyone be able to tell me howww close this soundtrack is to the original? "
,iSeshan,2011-06-05T16:50Z,Is this in HD?
[V],lord_terabyte,2012-03-29T14:55Z,"Unfortunately the ripper did not know how to convert the improper 29.97 frame rate back to PAL 25 or film 24, thus a great many frames will look like shit. Discerning downloaders will want to snatch a better copy. I'm going with a .99GB copy with 3 scores even though I only need one...I don't tolerate poor quality encoding."
,baybeh,2012-05-05T13:49Z,does it have the commentary that the uploader's description mentions?
,vickypep,2012-06-06T12:25Z,eyxaristw poly!!!
,baybeh,2012-08-05T18:28Z,no commentary. and the score is by cinematic orchestra. what about the original?
