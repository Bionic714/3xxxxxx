This is the NHL game with the Pittsburgh Penguins vs. the Philadephia Flyers on 10-14-05

A good chunk of the 2nd period is missing as my recording program crashed, but you can find out what happened from the intermission recap or the boxscore.

There're also highlight clips of Sebastian Caron's "THE SAVE", and Talbot's goal from center.

A few torrents from this season is included in case you've missed them.

Ready? It's time...
