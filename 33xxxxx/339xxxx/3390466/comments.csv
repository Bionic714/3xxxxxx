,"who,me?",2006-01-03T09:53Z,"A little seed, please. Thank you, Sickboy88.. The work you do is fantastic."
,lillefot89,2006-01-24T23:55Z,i agree
,Mr_Ecks,2006-04-02T19:53Z,Could somebody seed please?
,Zensch,2006-04-30T20:50Z,I will seed once I get this ;)
,GormurX,2006-05-30T16:37Z,"Pls. excuse me if this is a stupid question,
but why is this movie only 700.38Mb?
How is the quality?"
,diddyu,2007-03-21T05:06Z,"700 Megs is typical for a movie, If you're thinking that a dvd holds 4.7 gigs, you'd be right, its all in how formatted (not sure if thats the right word). Trust me, its good quality, or atleast it should be.

Sickboy, what would you say if I said &T?"
,Danorou,2007-07-23T02:10Z,"Great torrent, thanx! Love this movie!"
,BurgerDude,2007-10-20T12:29Z,Would anyone have the decency to seed for a while? =)

,asmodeus2008,2008-03-26T17:18Z,Seed plz! 
,outlaw241,2008-07-08T21:23Z,worst movie of all time
,ninzo,2009-03-06T02:30Z,they messed with the story so much to make this movie a stand-alone. it's a shame really. awesome radio series though.
