,ray555,2008-02-23T20:03Z,"Got it somewhat working:

The Crack is located on the Civilisation III iso, mount it and right-click open it. There's a folder called CRACK. The cracks are for the expansions though and not the original. Once you've installed the expansions copy and paste the crack apps to the root game folder with the un-cracked app of the same name and replace it: ie - Civ3Conquests.exe and Civ3X.

Only Civ3X worked for me though. But it does work. I imagine the other one works too but I'm not going to bother with it."
,SLAVDABEAST666,2008-03-18T13:10Z,"hey i mounted ""civilization III""
then i made the setup of the game done and everything
so my setup is done, now when i try to open the game from desktop it says that i need the CD-key
I downloaded some crack when i open the crack, it says  thats the binkw32.dll file is missing
the binkw32.dll file is in the civilization 3 iso file in the win2k folder... but it still wont let me play the game, wut do i do when it says binkw32.dll is missing, but i no where it is?"
,mwmoriarty,2008-04-03T01:05Z,"Sorry, but there is no CRACK folder on the CivilizationIII.iso and the only Crack I can find is the Civ3Conquests.exe. The fdx-cc22.nfo file is the only instructions I see and it talks about the the patches and copying the Civ3Conquests.exe over to the Conquests folder after installing Conquests. There is no Civ3x crack so I really do not know what you guys are talking about."
,leekhead,2008-04-08T18:40Z,"Installation Instructions

Burn the three .iso's into a CD or mount them on any virtual drive tool like Daemon tools or Alcohol 120%. Install the original CivIII. After installation copy the binkw32.dll file from the CivIII CD to the Civilization III folder.

Install ""Play the World"" from the PTW iso. After installation, patch PTW with the appropriate Play the World patch. The patch is in the torrent's main folder. Now mount then explore the Conquest.iso and then copy the PTW crack from the ""CRACK"" folder to the PTW folder in your comp.

Install conquests. Patch it first (patch can be found bundled with the PTW patch) before cracking. DO NOT use the conquest crack found the the conquest iso! Rather, go to the torrent's main folder again the extract the working crack from the fdx-cc22.rar file. Crack and play.

Note: As far as I know you can only play the expansions and not the original game from this torrent."
,ll_Jee_ll,2008-06-02T16:15Z,"leekhead, since your Install Instructions doesn't work I suggest that you stop posting incorrect instructions. And also, the instructions were totaly incomplete. But thx for trying.. I'll put up an install guide, asap."
,jontrull,2008-06-07T17:15Z,every time i start the fucking game it says theres a problem and it needs to shut down...can anyone help me with this?

,ltcmdrData,2008-08-17T00:31Z,"I have a question, I actually own the game, and was wondering if the iso for the discs actually work if you burn them to a disc or if it pops up ""the original disc could not be found or authenticated"". I have tried making images of the discs and they always do that, I got it working one time, had the image on alcohol 120% and the game worked without a patch, however when I restarted my computer, it didn't work:("
,ltcmdrData,2008-08-17T00:49Z,"||_jee_||, I don't see how you didn't get leekheads instructions, they WERE correct, I have done it with the images I have created from my discs of the game. here are simple instructions:
1-once you have all 3 disc images, create a virtual drive using alcohol120%.

2-mount the 1st disc image to the virtual drive.

3-once you mount the 1st disc image, an install window should pop-up, click install. if a window doesn't pop-up, go to my computer, and click on the virtual drive, it should have a civ3 icon as the drive icon.

4-install the first disc, when the set up requires the next disc, simply mount disc 2, you can un-mount the disc one image, or you should be able to just click disc 2 in alcohol120% and then click ""mount image"".

5-when the setup asks for the next discs, it should ask which drive the next disc will be on, make sure its the virtual drive the image is mounted on.

6-continue this process until all discs are installed, then go to the games root folder, ""C/ program files/ firaxis games/ civilization 3"" and put the cracks with their corresponding folders, ptw crack goes in the play the world folder, or ptw. the conquest crack goes in the conquest folder. once the cracks are in their corresponding folders, activate the cracks, once its been cracked you should be able to play the game, but note, the cracks make the game a little confusing, when you go into the game,the options aren't what they say, like to load a game, you have to go to play last world, and for scenario you have to go to load game. you will see what I mean once you do it. now enjoy one of my favorite all time games!

oh yeah, if you need a crack, here is a link to some cracks for conquests and PTW.

The writing is a little fucked up but the buttons are at the right spot, so if you get problems I suggest you get images, like photos, not the kind of ""iso-shit people are talking about(yeah I'm a reel noob in this area and I know I would get confused) of the menu etc. to know which buttons to click on ;)"
,mrcombs777,2009-04-10T23:51Z,ok if your having a problem with a crack and getting the bwink thing it is either your crack might be crupted (which happened to me) or you did not have the right version of the crack. so those might be some soluntions if you have and Q's just ask me cause i do this a lot and i can pretty much fix any torrent

,KaosBlitze,2010-01-09T21:53Z,ill come write in a week when this download finishes downloading.. no seeders?
,dragon_515,2010-02-03T16:46Z,"Here is instructions for newbies:

1. Download the torrent.

2. Either:
   A) Create a virtual Drive OR
   B) Insert a blank CD or DVD

3. Use software to burn the .iso disk image to the disk or virtual drive. 
(The Iso file should be called CivilizationIII.iso and should be 577, 000 kb)

4. Go to My Computer and right click either the virtual drive or the CD/DVD you created and select explore.

5. Double click on the Setup.exe file. Do not click autorun or similar files as they do not work with the torrent.

6. Install the game.

7. Once installed go to:
http://www.freeinfosociety.com/site.php?postnum=16 and click Civilization 3.

8. Download the file named ""Crack for version 1.0 ENG"".

9. Replace the .exe or executable file where you installed the game with the crack. Delete the original.

10. Now you can access the game and enjoy. 

NOTES: If you can't follow this guide, you probably didn't download files properly. Also if you encounter and .rar files unrar them in case I missed that part."

It seems like a great many of you have had some problems with the crack so I put together a little guide for all retards out there. However most of this is already posted but I guess this can be seen as a sort of updated guide with a more pedagogical touch.  
Yes there is a crack for both of the expansions but I do not believe that there is a crack for the original game; however, Zanulix was nice enough to post a link to a site where you easily can download a working crack for Civiliztion3.  Go to http://www.freeinfosociety.com/site.php?postnum=16 ---> click the Crack for Version 1.0 ENG download it and save it to your desktop. When done so, right click the downloaded file and click extract files here. You will now see an icon with the name Civilization3 on your desktop. 
Find the folder that you installed the game to, probably C: - Program Files - Infogrames Interactive - Civilization II. After opening the folder, right click the Civilization3 icon on your desktop ? copy and paste it into the installation folder, you will now be asked if you want to replace an already existing file, press ok, DONE. Now you can play the game and if you feel like it, create a shortcut of the crack to your desktop. if someone needs any further help with the installation I guess I might post a how-to guide for that as well, but this is it for now.

,mtorresm,2011-01-29T20:20Z,"The contents of this torrent is messy, this is what's wrong with it:
* It includes no crack for the ORIGINAL Civ3 game (for playing without the expansions).
* The working crack for CONQUESTS is in the .rar file right inside the torrent (fdx-cc22.rar). The one from DEViANCE inside the "".iso"" (.bin) for CONQUEST doesn't work. The one for PLAY THE WORLD does, though.
* It unnecessarily includes the "".iso"" (.bin) for PLAY THE WORLD, when in fact the whole of that is already included in the second expansion, i.e.: CONQUESTS. That means this torrent might as well be 644MB lighter! No need to install or download rzr-c3pw.bir and rzr-c3pw.cue

On the other hand, this ultimately works... and it's virus free. If, nonetheless, you can't get it to work, try this much more organized torrent:
