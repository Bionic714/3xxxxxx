This is the SYNCFIX for S1E1 *only*!

Rip Notes (from NFO):

The episode one is slightly asynchronous and we rls this syncfix. 
Though it is a little late, it would be better than nothing.
Sorry for the inconvince caused by the former rls 

unrar wat-xvid-dhs01e01-syncfix.rar to where you place the original
avi file, run fix.bat. you can delete the original avi file after
the process finish.
