,X-Pirate,2008-05-09T13:21Z,"Actually, Klabbe80, it was nearly finished when it was cancelled. Some say it was only days away from going Gold though, I don't know how much truth is in that. The reason you state for its cancellation isn't the real reason why it got binned though. It was actually Sierra who are to blame. No one really knows (except those involved) why they did it though. It had something to do with money no doubt."
,VileCore,2008-05-14T23:49Z,"Yeah, or petty fucking vindictiveness."
,VileCore,2008-06-01T00:56Z,"EDIT: I discovered, though patient diligence and bribery involving cats and cheese, that Sierra had a lot of ""changing hands"" at the time: People got fired, people got promoted and decisions were changed and remade. And so a Mac Half-Life was scrapped.
Boo fucking hoo. "
