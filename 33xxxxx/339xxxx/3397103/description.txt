I recently saw an old VH1 video: The DIVAS live 1999; a charity concert promoting musical education in American public (not private) schools. It stars Whitney Houston who apparently made enemies with some other divas that very evening, such as Cher, Mary Blige etc.

However, there was this one girl that I kind of fell in love with, who, in my opinion, stole the show completely: Leann Rimes. Not only was the famous voice of Whitney Houston?s a lot below average that evening while Leann's voice glowed of golden warmth. Also, Leann is very beautiful and wore a beautiful skirt that evening (ahh, that skirt!). Above all, she didn't act like a diva at all but very natural and perhaps a bit shy, too. As the presenting host, Elton John, says: a FANTASTIC girl.

Encoded from commercial dvd to the highest quality .avi I was able to, using DivX.
