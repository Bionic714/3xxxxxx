Don't suppose anyone has a lossless version of this ?"
,BlackDahlia,2008-11-07T09:08Z,"I went to http://www.findagrave.com and there is nothing on John Peel. Is there anyone out there from Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England, or parts nearby, who can post to findagrave about John Peel's final resting place including photos of the headstone? It would be fitting to the many fans who can never visit his grave due to distance, etc.
