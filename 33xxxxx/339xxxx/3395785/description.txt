John Peel's Perfumed Garden - 14th August 1967 - Revision 3 (September 2005)


This is a remaster of John Peel's final Perfumed Garden show on Radio London, on 14th August 1967. The following day, the new Marine Offences Act took effect, forcing the pirate stations to close down. Peel would join newly-created BBC pop station Radio One shortly afterwards, where he would remain for 37 years until his untimely death last year. 

It was the height of the Summer of Love, and Peelie was still sounding like a posh, rather shy young hippy after returning to the UK from his brief radio stint in America. Peel's eclectic choice of music is much in evidence in this special 5Â½-hour final show, which kicked off at midnight.


This remaster has been put together by Guy Brown at U-SPACES (http://members.aol.com/VelvetFogg/HTML/PEEL.html). Tapes of the show have been upgraded with high-fidelity masters of the songs Peel played, so only the links are in whiny Radio London quality.

This is Revision 3 of the remaster, completed in September of 2005, which restores all of the Peel links that were missing in previous versions, and corrects some running order mistakes. If you have a version of this and want to check if you need to upgrade, the best way is probably to see if you have Simon & Garfunkel's "Sparrow" on disc 4. That's new for this version.

Artwork and sleevenotes are included as Word documents. They're designed to fit in slimline jewelcases (the ones used for CD singles). There's a lot more information about the show, and the reconstruction project, in Guy's excellent sleevenotes.

96 tracks, 128Kbps MP3. Total time 5 hours 38 minutes approx.


Incidentally, Peelie's very first Radio One show, which would be his next radio show after this one, will be broadcast soon on BBC 6 Music as part of "John Peel Day":
