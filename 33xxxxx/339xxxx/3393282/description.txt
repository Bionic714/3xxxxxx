Install Notes
-----------------------
1. Put the cue files in Alcohol 120% and mount cd-image #1 by double
   clicking disc 1 in the alcohol window.
2. Start the installation by clicking the install button on the
   auto-run screen.
   If you don't get the auto-run screen, go to "My computer" and then
   double click the virtual cd-drive with the Lionhead logo.
3. Use the Deviance keygenerator to get a serial number. It's pretty
   slow, but at least it works.
4. Mount the next image when needed (ALT-TAB).
5. When you're done with everything, simply mount the first image disc
   again and run the game!

Enjoy!



IMPORTANT: I got no connections to NOBODY and DEViANCE what so ever. 
           If you get anyproblems, read the install notes again or put
           a comment on Piratebay or something.

Thanks to: Piratebay, isohunt, NOBODY, DEViANCE and my mom :D

This is my first torrent btw...
