,RRP_Playboy,2006-01-04T03:43Z,"OK now i got it, Mount the .mds file with D-tools and run it on media player :-)"
,paulsenp,2006-01-24T15:10Z,"Is this the PDQ or ""the real thing""?"
,cookypuss,2006-02-22T14:31Z,"Pls can somebody in BKK re-seed this? I'm on 2.5MB DSL, but we all know that's only good for .th

,djgap,2007-02-02T17:32Z,"where are the audio files (*.mds)  for units 2, 4, 6 and 8?"
,djgap,2007-02-02T17:52Z,"woops, sorry - i figured it out...  they put 2 units on each .mds file...  but there are several pages missing from the pdf file - namely 6,7,48,50,64.   page 65 is the last page included tho can't tell if there are any missing after that.."
,Rockerx,2007-07-03T11:02Z,"Hi dude! I tell you how to open mdf fils-I admitt its littel tricky... First you have to have a program call Ultraiso,then you open the program and import the mdf file.Then the will open the mdf fil wich it is sound tracks f.eks.1-32.Now you can burn it on a ordinary cd-r or rw atleast 80 min 700mb . After you finish whith burn it you can use it on a dvd player-the formate is now cdda...Enjoy!!!"
,Rockerx,2007-07-03T11:10Z,"At least iam one of the seeder now,i upload more the 1GiB..."
,mauiboy2112,2008-05-28T11:40Z,I am still having trouble opening this file after trying suggestions. Anyone got an easier way to open/use this file? 
,8outof10owners,2010-06-19T12:29Z,"Another way of dealing with the mdf/mds files is to use Alcohol 120% (download here http://www.filehippo.com/download_alcohol_120/  or just google it if the link is dead) 

You can use Alcohol 120% to burn the images onto 4 CDs.  They are audio CD format so will play in a CD player.  Or you can rip the CDs  and make mp3s out of them.

You could bypass the physical CD stage by just mounting the image of each file using Alcohol 120%.  This fools your computer into thinking that it has a CD drive with an audio CD in it.  You can either play the ""CD"" in your computer
or rip it to mp3s without having to burn the actual CDs.  All 4 CDs come to 247MB as 128kb/s mp3s rather than 2.7GB as mdf/mds image files. Whouda thought it :P

To answer an earlier question: the title of the book is PDQ. 

Reviews of the book on Amazon say that it's 64 pages long, so apart from the individual missing pages (6,7,48,50,64) the book is probably complete. 

Thanks to everyone who kept this seeded for so long :)"
