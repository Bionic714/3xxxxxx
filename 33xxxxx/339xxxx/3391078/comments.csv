,flea-dom,2008-07-19T02:15Z,"This guy is unreal. I hope his albums don't suck, cause i think most of his show is the energy he stirs up in the crowd, and i don't know if he'll be able to capture the essence of that in the studio.
Hopefully so, likely not. It's really hard to do, and many people have tried."
,bmcgrove,2008-10-16T00:06Z,"so pessimistic flea-dom..  sometimes a performance can carry over into your car, or your ipod.. that's the great thing about music..  it flows through you and affects your mood at the core, not only saying something to you on the surface.."
,Kevone07,2009-01-28T23:45Z,"flea-dom I do not know what you are talking about because all of his music is good. Obviously if you think his music is unreal then you should not listen to it. I am not trying to be mean or anything, I am just giving you an option because when I do not like some kind of music or think it is unreal then I do not listen to the artist anymore. Give it an option. Also bmcgrove you are exactly right and you are the kind of people that we need to listen to these kind of music."
,MissRoar,2009-05-08T08:41Z,"Kevone: flea-dom was being complimentary when he said ""unreal"". That is a positive term - like ""Wow, Jimi Hendrix is so good at guitar, it's unreal."" Flea-dom was saying in his comment that he has seen Michael Franti live and it was really good but he hasn't listened to his albums so he is hopeful that the recordings are able to capture the energy he has live. Hope this clears things up. :D"
,samwelle,2009-09-07T10:19Z,"I just got back from a Michael Franti concert at Bumbershoot 09 in Seattle. The music changed my life. He brings the entire crowd to a joyful place, a place that I've really been needing to go. 

So thank you to Michael, and Peace to all my brothers and sisters."

,rdrive,2011-01-09T15:46Z,Thanks for the music and learn that MP3's and CD's should be written as MP3s and CDs.
