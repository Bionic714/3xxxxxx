,nothing__void,2007-07-10T09:10Z,"This is DVD 5- Being disk one of season three. Looks like it didn't fit as one DVD for some reason, but the last part (disk two) is also available on here. Todd's supposed to be releasing a ten year anniversary DVD set with lots of extras, as well as picking up where this series (unfortunately unfinshed) left off. I will seed as I see it needed."
