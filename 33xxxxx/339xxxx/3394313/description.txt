"Creator of one of the greatest characters of our generation, David Brent - Ricky Gervais leaves aside people-watching for a while and takes on our animal cousins.

Specially filmed for this DVD during the limited run at The Bloomsbury Theatre,
'Animals' is the freshest and funniest live stand-up from the country's finest comedian."

Here it is! Ricky gervais first ever live stand-up show now on DVD... Animals!

This XviD is a 100% replica of the Ricky Gervais - Animals DVD bought in the UK.

Easy.. Just open the avi file in your favourite media player that supports XviD codecs. The quality of this movie is great, bury in mind that it's only a fragment of the original DVD size. It's good enough for most people! 

There are no subtitles. Sorry for that. Why not you may ask. Well. They didn't 
make any fucking subtitles! So you deaf people, sorry about that. No comedy for you!

My upload speed is 400 (50 kB/s) so please be patient..
