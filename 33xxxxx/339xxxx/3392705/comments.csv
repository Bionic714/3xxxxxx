,CoLLecToR 91,2006-11-23T14:42Z,why is that retarded? a rar file takes less space.
,Rcco3,2006-12-28T11:09Z,The best N64 emulator is Project64.You can find them in a lot of websites.Visit www.emuparadise.com for a wide collection of ROM's.Or is it www.emu-paradise.com ?
,fnyzzel,2007-01-03T14:25Z,"The best emulators I know are

For NES: RockNES
http://rocknes.kinox.org/

For SNES: Definitely ZSNES, some people might prefer snesx9, but I honestly don't see why. ZSNES comes with far better speed and compability.
http://www.zsnes.com/

For N64: As someone mentioned Project64 is a very fast, compatible and reliable N64 emulator. Just make sure you have a reasonably fast computer if you want to emulate N64 at full speed.
http://www.pj64.net/main/index.php

http://zophar.net is another great site with tons of emulators for just about any console or arcade machine, and for all platforms (mac, pc, linux...). It also has a lot of utilities for editing roms, playing in-game music and that kinda stuff."
,hellwarmaker,2007-01-05T18:48Z,if you have any problems getting started http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/n64/project64.html                         its the best emulator
,hellwarmaker,2007-01-05T18:49Z,http://www.emulator-zone.com/ go here heh previos one is only n64
,Nicalapegus,2007-01-10T19:14Z,"www.emuparadise.org is all you need.

Everything you need with next to no pop ups."
,shadowelf61,2007-01-24T03:28Z,"You can get the emulators for these, and other systems, at (http://www.zophar.net). It has an emulator for *almost* EVERY SYSTEM MADE. That includes some things like X-box, PlayStation 2, and others. It also has emulators for handhelds, which INCLUDES the NINTENDO DS! That's where you need to go if your looking for emulators! Oh, and old skool games ROCK. ^_^
(Zophars Domain has NO ROMS! Just emulators!)"
,shadowelf61,2007-01-27T20:33Z,"Very sorry. I haven't used it yet, I just that it had an X-Box and PlayStation 2 emulator. I have never downloaded and used it yet so I wouldn't know if it worked or not. Sorry about that. ^_^"

"
,TheStriker7,2008-02-18T18:02Z,do these all work on Project 64? 
,phaze424,2008-08-13T19:06Z,"Jesus, seclusive, chill the fuck out. If all you wanted was one ROM, go to a goddamn ROM site and download it. TPB isn't really the place to go looking for individual ROMs anyway.

Anyway, great torrent, DarthVada. thxmuch."
