    That all proves that FLT's release was a definite beta (i.e. a copy for a 
    magazine (p)review) and not a store final. [BTW, we recommend that a certain 
    FLT person takes a closer look at the cgamex86.dll on his beta cd.]
    
    Lately we have seen a number of newbies and dumb biased scene nukers asking
    why DEViANCE even bother to release finals for games that have been 
    released as late betas by other groups. We couldn't say it better than our
    competition themselves have done, as quoted from an nfo for a game that 
    FLT put the US-store final out for (Final Fantasy 8):
        
    "So here you have the full FINAL version of this Huge game and Error free 
     Bins, Killing two birds with One Stone. The purpose of the ISO scene is 
     to share images of store final CDS, the same product that would be sold 
     as retail in a software shop. Otherwise we risk problems of update patches 
     not working correctly."
     
    We would welcome if all groups aimed to uphold quality in the iso-releasing 
    scene - and that means that groups do not release betas intentionally and 
    that they do not release versions of games of which they are not sure if 
    they are really final. Mistakes in judging what is final and what is beta 
    can of course happen and have happened to us in the past as well.

    But we in DEViANCE believe that it is not acceptable when iso-groups like 
    FLT release betas in almost regular short intervals. We can only hope that 
    our competition in FLT will finally learn that reviewers' copies on gold 
    cdrs are almost never the final versions of a game - and definitely not 
    worthwhile iso releases.
    
    If you prefer betas, do not leech this release.

    Set during the most trying years of the war, from 1942 to 1945, Medal
    of Honor: Allied Assault gives you a sense of the courage it took to

    bridge at Remagen. You assume the role of Lt. Mike Powell, member of
