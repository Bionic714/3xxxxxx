,crunchyblack,2006-01-09T04:52Z,"Downloaded this show and the video it great, but there is no audio.  How do I get both audio and video files to play all at once.  Please go into detail."
,Analogy,2006-01-10T18:45Z,"The audio is VBR, which some media players have trouble with. The best suggestion I can give is use a media player which supports it such as VLC. http://www.videolan.org/. Sorry for the inconvenience, I didn't know about the issue until a lot of people started sending me messages about it, I'll do better next time."
,HaVoC666,2006-02-14T21:05Z,"Hi,

Why is the output choppy and bsplayer and media player and media player classic cannot even play those files. Only VLC player can play them but the video is choppy. Sound is OK!

Can somepody explain this?"
,W4NT3D,2006-03-10T02:22Z,Use Divx Player it works fine with me :) both audio & video
,dman555,2006-09-07T12:58Z,"Great rip, great viewer, VLC rocks. Keep it up dude! What a show by the way!!!"
,budbil23,2006-10-16T22:53Z,seed plz :)
,Quirky_Puppy,2007-02-02T13:33Z,"Would this be a good time to point out the ACTUAL version of season 1 is FOUR dvd's?

I highly doubt the quality of this."
[V],jnd,2007-02-04T22:34Z,"The video is obviously downsampled a lot to fit on about a quarter of its original size, but I think it's still much better quality here than on e.g. a TV rip of comparable size as the source is vastly better."
,Analogy,2007-08-12T11:36Z,"Maybe you should download the torrent and see the quality for yourself instead of posting useless FUD about your ""doubts""? Each episode is compressed to about 330MB, only slightly less than a typical TV rip."
,nyptv,2008-03-31T16:55Z,thx- im hooked on this show now- although its a  little late now that it got canceled :(
,elephantshell,2008-04-04T09:32Z,hey. please seed. :)
,coldtear,2008-05-11T11:52Z,"It's stupid...why rip it in lame vbr, when it can not be played in standalone players?! What's wrong with cbr mp3, or leaving it ac-3?
I should have read the nfo before downloading. Don't bother with this one, if you plan on watching it on your dvd/divx player!"
,slish480,2008-07-09T21:38Z,I downloaded this and it has no audio!
,CylonCenturion,2008-07-12T12:03Z,"vbr audio is useless. ac3 is just fine. I wonder why the author chose what that method. ac3 passthrough sounds better anyway and plays on more devices. Also, why isn't there an HD version of season one floating around anywhere? I've found HD for the miniseries, season 2 and season 3. Why not season one? BOO! :("
,eisschrank,2008-11-15T18:56Z,"Ripping a DVD to a universal format is such a simple process, yet time after time we find these horrible torrents that ONLY play in VLC because the ripper's knowledge is limited to clicking all the video/audio options and then wielding a list of dumb stats in the sad belief that everyone will think he's a fucking genius.
However, if you've spent days downloading this and want to stream it through your PS3, IO Data Link or whatever to your TV, it's certainly worth the effort to re-encode them. The quality is pretty good once you correct the hash the ripper made of them."
,Etni,2008-11-20T00:55Z,"Haven't downloaded this yet, but thanks in advance for squeezing it in one dvd and cutting the needless ""previously on..."" sequences. 

English subtitles available anywhere?"
,lamecandy,2008-12-03T01:59Z,I've used www.virtualdub.org to convert the audio to ac3 128kbit. It literary takes 1 min per episode. It now plays on my divx player
,dumpynl,2008-12-04T17:07Z,"The following media players don?t work with this XviD avi?s.

Windows Mediaplayers with DivX 6.8.2 and ac3 1.5 codecs.
Gom player.
DivX player 6.8.2.

Also all or most home DVD players with DixX codec will not play these XviD avi files. "
,paintbalz,2009-01-07T04:34Z,"Yea, don't download this if you want to watch it on a standalone DVD/Xvid player or PS3.  It will not work.  I'm very disappointed...  in myself for not reading all the comments.

This one works though...

,Wesslano,2009-01-19T13:50Z,"Guess I'll start with with this torrent, Season 1.
Hope this show is good and live up to its reputation.

Thx for the up Analogy"
,socratus,2009-01-30T03:47Z,thx
,max11max,2009-03-07T20:54Z,"Nice torrent, good quality but requires EXTRA CODEC'S to play in XP and VISTA. 

Would be nice if it was ripped to play and burn without."
,max11max,2009-03-07T21:31Z,"The above torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4260280/Battlestar_Galactica_Season_1 

Has a NASTY watermark.."
,Gwenno,2009-03-17T18:02Z,"I just finished, but can't watch, not in divX or media player, tried all sorts of codecs and they all say the file is corrupted, too bad..."
,legalizemeth,2009-03-22T23:50Z,"Thanks!

The quality is excellent, both video and audio.  It plays fine for me on a stock Ubuntu install.  No VLC needed.

To the complainers, don't look a gift horse in the mouth - transcode it yourself.  There's enough quality here to give decent results after transcoding to whatever format you need.

I just finished this season, and am now watching a more conventionally-encoded rip of season 2.  The drop in quality compared to this torrent, especially for the audio, is very, very noticeable.

PS: Thanks again to the ripped for cutting out the superfluous recap segments at the beginning of each episode!  Don't let the whiners get to you!"
,abhijit_net,2009-04-19T15:34Z,"This is cool,
Uploaded on 2005-10-08 !
I guess this one will stay strong for few more years.

Did you cut ""previously on Battlestar Galactica"" from the first episode ?
I think i will get 1 episode from some where else and rest from here.  "
,abhijit_net,2009-04-19T16:07Z,"After getting the plot:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3367082/Battlestar_Galactica_(pilot)
I wont need ""previously on Battlestar Galactica"" from 1st Episode !
So thanks man, nice torrent."
,abhijit_net,2009-04-21T01:04Z,"I just completed downloading few episodes, these are just DivX/Xvid Video with MP3 audio.
Damn you people cannot play those ?
Are you Zylons or some thing ?"
,Strajin-from-outer-space,2009-05-29T09:18Z,"You must use MediaCoder or something like that if you wanna see this show on your home (standalone) DIVX player!
I to sve zbog tog sajentologa,nau?nika koji koristi VBR MP3 na ovom ripu,nabijem mu Vibrator Mp3 u njegovu pedersku guzicu!"
,ickles,2009-10-21T20:08Z,"for any one having trouble with sound on this torrent, try up dating your codecs if that dont work run whole thing through 'Magic Video Convertor' withy your out put set to MP4. then burn using nero7. Both available here on TPB and are simple to use. cheers to the uploader good effort bad choice of audio file though."
,mrvain32,2009-11-25T09:36Z,"Thanks a lot...very good quality.
Finding subtitles for this is hard. Anyways thanks a lot."
,Jp9master,2009-12-27T00:06Z,alguien tiene subtitulos en espa単ol sincronizados para esta version?'''''''''

,AltayR,2010-07-23T22:26Z,"Did someone have correct english subs for these ?

All the subs I found aren't sync ..."

All subs I can find aren't sync ..."
,r0tt3n,2010-07-24T04:43Z,"Sigh... uploaded in 2005... ok... I'll cut them some slack.  If someone ripped a dvd into these formats, they'd be hung.  Doesn't play in media center, doesn't play in media player classic, transcoding ac3 audio?? Are you out of your fucking mind??  Oh well, on to season 2.  Thanks for a marginally annoying rip."
,kittyfluff,2010-08-03T13:54Z,"First three episodes didnt work and every one after that keeps skipping and 'stalling' while playing.

rather annoying, really."
,mauriciolondoo,2010-08-03T19:03Z,"Thank you very much!!!  Excellent torrent only good comments about it.  I really enjoy it.  
Thanks again."
,mauriciolondoo,2010-08-03T19:06Z,"For those with audio problems I use the BS Player and I had no problems at all.

PS: BS is not because of Battlestar, hehehe!"
,ProtoX4,2010-08-07T07:24Z,Videos don't work - any of them. At least not on Divx Player. It plays the 1st second of the video (without sound) then it stops. I click play and it does it again and sometimes crashed the player.
,trohat,2010-09-02T18:57Z,"for those who have troubles finding subtitles for this great torrent, try here:

,Vimes84,2010-09-23T16:19Z,"Something is not right. After 5 seconds, audio is gone. I use ffdshow and every other divx and xvid works fine.
VLC and MP Classic are able to open this, but I can't edit subtitles in them. "
,evilradius,2010-11-25T11:13Z,this is jimi hendrix`s dedicated ! I can say after all is the best sci-fi series i ever saw! Enjoy!
