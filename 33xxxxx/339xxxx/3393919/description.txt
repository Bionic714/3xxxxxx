Season 1 of Battlestar Galactica, ripped from the DVD box set. Sized to fit on a single DVD-R. The original 4-hour miniseries pilot is NOT included since that would've taken up too much space on the DVD-R.

Video: XviD, two pass VBR at 1000 kbps overall. 720x404, the highest non-anamorphic resolution possible for a 16x9 DVD rip.
Audio: LAME 3.97b1, VBR preset Medium, downmixed to stereo from the 5.1 AC3 original.

In the interests of saving space, I cut out the "previously on Battlestar Galactica" retrospective at the beginning of each episode. I figure it's mainly there because you have a week between episodes on TV, you don't really have that problem here.

Commentaries 9-13 are the original "podcasts" available on the Sci-Fi Channel web site, but there are a few DVD-only commentaries in there as well.

Have fun waiting for the conclusion to "Pegasus."
