,ClydeXL,2007-02-28T13:33Z,"If you receive the error: ""Unable to create 12.0 engine factory"", then you need to install Microsoft .Net framework 1.1. It's included on the CD.

,fox3r,2008-01-16T02:31Z,Having same problem with licenses.  Didn't work copying them from cd.
,Vikingman1111,2008-07-14T18:58Z,"Yup,

This one is tricky, and the shallow instructions don't fly. Answering yes, etc., then got me answering questions about a server, which I could not answer. The data file is there where it should be, so what is to be done with it? Also, I had to use Daemon tools to install. The CD I burned would not allow a boot."
,soulz9,2009-02-25T08:08Z,"Here are the steps that worked for me, and I am using Vista 64X.

1. Use Daemon Tool (to mount) or Burn on CD using Nero Express (Choose burn image).
2. Run AutoRun Mathcad 13 and click on ""Mathcad 13"", a message should pop up asking you to install ""Framework 1.1"", click on ""English Install"" and after installing Framework 1.1, cancel the Mathcad 13 install when a message pops up and Reboot, then after reboot start Autorun again and choose ""Mathcad 13"", follow the steps and press ""NEXT"" at product key window. Everything should work flawlessly."
,intlidave,2010-03-19T23:50Z,"To people having problems with license:
You need to run regedit and change the license path data key in 
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Mathsoft\Mathcad 13\FLEXlm
to where mcad13.dat is on your computer."
