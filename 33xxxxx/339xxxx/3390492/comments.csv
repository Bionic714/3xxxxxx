,xohshitztonysbackx,2008-01-20T08:13Z,"It's a NTSC game.



DVD Decrypter is the best to burn this game.
You will need to download this from a torrent. If you google it, it will state that the software is renamed to DVDFab which I hate to use. 
DVD Decrypter is out there someplace but I rather use the torrent one to get it."
,xohshitztonysbackx,2008-01-20T08:16Z,"By been uploaded to this site and yet only 5 seeders?

People need to start seeding so others can get this . I will be seeding all the time unless I turn the computer off."

,shcherbet,2009-05-20T09:26Z,Seeders plese back!
,sophiroth,2010-02-08T07:33Z,"Game works fine, thanks for the upload.

Although I recommend downloading the torrent for Supernova 2 because it's a better game and it will download faster :)"
