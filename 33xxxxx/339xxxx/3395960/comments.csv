,dead chinaman,2007-03-19T13:33Z,this is not the complete discography of frank zappa all of his albums cum to little under 10GB....He has 60 studio albums and 10 live ones
,D_H_A,2007-03-21T17:21Z,wtf? :D
,themind,2007-12-13T06:18Z,"Too bad ""Transmissions - Contact"" has a skip at 0:46 and again at 0:57. Guess the CD used for the rip was scratched, I'll haft to find a better copy of that song elsewhere."
,Woosh15,2008-01-10T14:35Z,"Thanks D_H_A. if, god forbid, this torrent has no more seeders and needs a seed, feel free to e-mail  me and I'll seed it. Woosh15@netzero.net"

,nrg-ch,2008-04-12T14:37Z,"D_H_A, luv ya, man! THX!!!"
,pooponceaday,2008-05-06T16:12Z,"Yes, the author of this torrent has created a directory in which the longest folder/file path is significant and may give you an error when trying to download.  I had my downloads going to: C:\Documents and Settings\username\My Documents\BitTorrent Downloads\ which created the problem.  This download location path, prepended to the downloaded file path, creates a pathname longer than my system can handle.  The solution:  Move your client's downloads folder to a spot with a short pathname.  I had to save mine to the top-level of my C drive.  

Anyway, it turns out dead chinaman is right, this torrent is much smaller than the complete studio works of Frank Zappa.  Who knew Frank Zappa was so active in the music biz? (WTF)"
