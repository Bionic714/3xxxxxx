I just stumbled upon this by looking at the Wikipedia on Clive barker.. the only way this will get out better is to attach tag words, like horror, kill, blood and so on.. otherwise this will stay in obscurity and forever have no seeds."
,dielaughing,2011-06-28T05:27Z,"fredsaxon, if you're still out there, please some back and reseed this torrent. These two relics aren't very easy to locate. I wished they were on Demonoid, 'cause at least there I could send you a PM (that and the community would be sure to seed this and not let it die) ANYONE having this %100 and can seed, there is at least 11 people sitting on some %87 and patiently waiting for the master seed to come along and make it happen. Lets make the dead walk again..."
,dielaughing,2011-07-03T08:48Z,"Tha hell man...! I know I ain't seeding what I'm not gettin' @ %100 in the near future with this! Pissin' me off... it's like this torrent doesn't exist, aside from the ones who que up and wait for it."
