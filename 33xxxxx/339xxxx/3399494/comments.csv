,XOIIO,2011-01-19T02:11Z,"Forget what I said, it can't make a GIF with a framerate that is close enough to the movie. It looks choppy and bad."
,Bluristic,2011-12-01T04:46Z,"Thank you very much for the torrent!

@XOIIO - the framerate won't be perfect but you can adjust it quite alot from 50-750 framerates and imo it's wide range and decent enough to get a good gif"
