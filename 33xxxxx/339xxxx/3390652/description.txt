Good set of features but not very reliable - the program missed many adware components during our review, which were immediately detected by 2 other scanners (Ad-Aware, Spy Sweeper) that we ran after Spyware Doctor claimed a complete cleanup. By performing a fast detection at Windows start-up you will be alerted with a list of the potential threats identified. 
Did you know that every keystroke, every website and conversation can be recorded or monitored by people or companies that may have installed software on your PC, typically without your knowledge? Learn more about the importance of removing spyware with our Spyware Showcase. 
When you consider the amount of valuable personal information stored on your PC, including credit card and banking details, personal e-mails and documents, shopping and browsing habits, the risks of having software intruders become obvious. Known consequences of spyware and adware include identity theft, computer problems, slow Internet access, changed homepage and favorites, and excessive numbers of pop-up adverts. Anti-virus software and firewalls do not fully protect your system against the majority of spyware and privacy threats. Spyware is commonly bundled with software downloads, attached to e-mails, or transmitted through networks so it can appear to be legitimate software, but once installed it can be nearly impossible to detect and remove without the help of a dedicated spyware removal tool like Spyware Doctor.
