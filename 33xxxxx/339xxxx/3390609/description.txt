The thrill!
The excitement!
In case you played FF7 but haven't played it for ages: Some nostalgy!
In case you played FF7 but never finished it: Answers to all of your questions!

So here's a video of me playing the end fights of Final Fantasy VII. I think I did pretty well, but there are still some rock dull moments in it: The stairway (too many random encounters) and the materia-setting before the Bizarro fight (I didn't even use the other group...) Other than that, it's pretty enjoyable watch in my opinion.

The videos are in Ogg Theora format - I recommend VLC (http://www.videolan.org/vlc/) to play them.
