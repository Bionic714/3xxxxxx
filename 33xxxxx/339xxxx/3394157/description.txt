BATHURST - Start & Finish Race Summary (2005)

       V8 Supercars in the most popular motorsport category in
       Australia. See how they race  their unique V8's around the
       countries most popular and famous race track, Mount Panarama,
       Bathurst. A 6.2KM track up and down a mountain, it's an
       endurance race that lasts over 6 hours long, 1000 KM in total
       (That's 621 miles for you Americans)

       It's a showcase of the 2 local car manufactorers, FORD &
       HOLDEN (Australia's branch of GMC)

       It was decided to not rip the entire day, as a 6 hour video
       would be both huge and somewhat daunting to first time
       viewers, so this includes pre-race footage, the first 6 laps,
       and then the final 45 minutes of the race.

       If you haven't seen the V8 Supercars before, this is
       defiantely the best track and event to have your first look.
