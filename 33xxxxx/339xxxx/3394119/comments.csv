,zru2u,2007-02-03T04:43Z,"could someone pleeze SEED!?

been @ 99.7 for a couple weeks now...and half of the leechers seem to be ~99% as well :(

>for some strange reason the tracker --->
says 1 seed but their are NONE according to the actual torrent itself (i'm only uploading to others currently)"
,zru2u,2007-02-08T06:34Z,"THANK YOU to whoever finally saw the previous comment!

I'll be seeding for quite awhile (Even after burning it...I'll just move the files to a diff comp so I can seed indefinitely :D)


Remember it's not about quality all together with torrents, quantity does a lot as well.... I'll up it to a couple other sites (ISOHunt anyone?) in a few days here so that everyone can enjoy this awesome movie!"
,zru2u,2007-05-08T00:51Z,"i'd edit one of my previous posts, but yea, w/e

just figured out how picky ut was about rehash-checking MOSTLY downloaded files now i can seed the rest of the files ;D

...i forgot one the files a while ago when i did a backup and so i gotta re-DL one of the biggies (.99GB, blah)

as promised b4, i'll seeder for a longtime afterwards :D"
