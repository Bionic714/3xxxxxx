,matte79,2006-10-10T23:42Z,"Någon som vet  va det är för fel när man startar spelet  så stängs det ner  direct igen 

Likadant när man startar Quake4Ded.exe
rutan kommer upp och  bläddrar igenom  sen stängs det ner

Har  laddat ner en massa olika  Quake4 installationer nu och alla gör likadant !

Någon som vet  ?"

,MoonDown,2006-11-04T18:45Z,"For u people who still have some problem, unrar with ex, winrar. Use Daemon tools and install the game, use any cd key that works.
And for u that it says, - Please insert the quake 4 dvd, click OK and restart the application, 
Probably u dont have cracked the game, just download a crack from ex, mininova or here on TPB. Then I got a problem, when I started the game the computer says that I have a invalid cd key, and when I see your cd key, xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx it's just to long.
The cd key should be with just 4 culomns becuase the game can't take more than 4.
But all the cd keys I have tested have 5.
It's weard plz send me a message if u know."

,ikono69,2007-06-27T15:59Z,"This one REALLY WORKS!
There's just one issue with the key: if you have InterThis one REALLY WORKS!
There's just one issue with the key: the program checks the key ONLINE, if it is valid, which, of course, fails with generated keys!
So, either use a crack, which I personally would not recommend because most crashes are produced by crashes, or - the much better solution:
PREVENT the program from connecting to the server. The most thrilling solution I found is this one:
*) open (the file) C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts with your favorite editor
*) add the following line to this file:
127.0.0.1       q4master.idsoftware.com

... and don't forget to INSTALL THE PATCH!!!
the most current version is v1.4.2 - you can get it from:

enjoy!
and MANY THANKS to the uploader"

,pmfabri,2010-01-19T19:34Z,Why the fuck do these fucking noobs have to make fucking split archives? what a dumbass noob. Why the fuck can't it be a single archive? 
,mark_e7,2010-03-16T10:58Z,"its very easy 

first open one archive and extract file .Then mount it with deamon tools .install the game without removing your internet plug .The game will ask cd key.Use this

RJ7H-T7MM-CR7W-7PNW-DTW7

then will be installed.Then download and install quake4 1.4.2 patch.Then it will ask cd key again.So remove your internet plug before you start the game and use this 

xxrg -jmwr-7pwm-ndtc-cppn

and don't use - in between cd key in the game after installing like this

xxrgjmwr7pwmndtccppn

Enjoy and have fun!!!!!! "
