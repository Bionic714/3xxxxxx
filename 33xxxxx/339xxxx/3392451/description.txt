CRAFT (SWE)
FUCK THE UNIVERSE (Carnal Records)
Reviewed by Geert on Tuesday 27 September 2005.

?Fuck The Universe? is the long awaited third full length album of Swedish Black Metal band Craft. Since their predecessors ?Terror Propaganda? and ?Total Soul Rape? are like cult releases in the underground scene, I guess lots of people are looking forward to this new album.
After listening the album a few times, It becomes clear to me that ?Fuck The Universe? is more mid-tempo based than ever before. The dirty guitar riffs even more outstanding and are colouring the music darker than we?re used to hear on both previous albums. In musical way you can see ?Fuck the Universe? as a logical follow-up of ?Terror Propaganda?. The Darkthrone influences are still presented, yet it seems Craft finally found their identity so those influences are now better melted with their own sordid style of offending blasphemy. I won?t be surprised if Craft soon will not be a follower anymore, but a source of inspiration for a new generation of black metal bands.
The grooving filth machine of Craft did it again, nowadays the band is stronger and more convincing than ever before. With ?Fuck the Universe? the four bandmembers released their best album so far, and I?m sure this one can be found in many year-lists at the end of this year.
