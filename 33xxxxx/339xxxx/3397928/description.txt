Depeche Mode: Playing The Angel

This is from SKK's torrent (http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3396533), but I added the missing FLAC song tags and fixed the b0rken file names.
Many thanks to SKK for his original upload!

Oh yeah, it's all in glorious FLAC, of course!

P.S.
This is the first .torrent I've made with Azureus and posted on TPB. Please be gentle with me! :)
