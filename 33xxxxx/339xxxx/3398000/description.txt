Jerks of All Trades(1949)

Jerks is a 1949 kinescope pilot film. Filmed before a live audience,

is the homeowner. Enjoy.

Date released: 10/12/1949
Featuring: Moe, Larry and Shemp
Length: 20 min

Moe, Larry and Shemp are three bumbling interior decorators 
who manage to trash their clients' homes.
This was filmed before a live, studio audience as a pilot for 
a planned TV series on ABC, which, unfortunately, was never 
picked up. Actor Joseph Kearns (the original Mr. Wilson on 
TV's DENNIS THE MENACE) appears in a cameo role as a presure-
cooker salesman from Punxatawney, Pennsylvania. The following 
text is from the book, THE THREE STOOGES SCRAPBOOK, written 
by Joan Howard Maurer and Jeff and Greg Lendburg. "The pilot, 
which took one day to film, was never aired. B.B. Kahane, 
Columbia Picture's Vice-President of Business Affairs, stopped 
the show from being broadcast. Kahane warned the Stooges that 
a contract stipulation restricted them from performing in a 
TV series that might compete with their two-reel comedies. 
Columbia further threatened to cancel the boys' contract and 
take them to court if they tried to sell the series. To avert 
a legal hassel, the pilot was shelved and the project abandoned." 

Stooge Goofs & Technical Blunders 

Visible cue
At the beginning, you can see Moe looking off- camera for his cue 
on when to say his first line. 

Missed cue
Symona Boniface misses her cue for when to say "Hello" on the phone 
when she's speaking to Moe. 

Prop mishap
When Larry is supposed to hang the wallpaper up as a curtain, he has 
trouble doing so and causes the bit to go on too long, so he ad-libs 
"You gotta use your head to get this thing up here!", cueing Shemp 
to start goin on with the next bit where he paints the wall with his 
paintbrush-hat. 

Wrong cabinet
When Moe ducks right before the top cabinet is supposed to open, the 
2nd to top cabinet is accidentally pushed open instead, and it bangs 
right into the side of Moe's head. You can see Moe awkwardly pausing 
for a few seconds before continuing with the bit. 

Prop mishap
When the cabinet is supposed to open automatically and knock Moe and 
Larry down, it doesn't open far enough, so the crew member had to push 
it again.
