Additional Notes .........:
         This movie was very close to fitting untouched after stripping out
         all the studio logos/warnings/extras and the other audio tracks. However,
         it was still approximately 130megs to big for a DVDR. This left us with a
         few options. One option was to re-encode the entire movie. Another option 
         was to cut most of the end credits (something we've done in the past), and
         yet another was to re-encode the end credits. But we only had 30 megs of
         space left for 4 minutes of end credits, which wasn't enough for a decent
         bitrate. So instead of cutting the credits, or re-encoding the full movie,
         we came up with another alternative. We re-encoded the first cell (aproximately 60 seconds, containing studio logos and intro credits) and the second to last cell, which contained the end credits. This allowed us to keep the movie
         itself untouched (except where noted) and keep the credits for those that want them.
