,zeinabqureshi,2008-02-04T09:07Z,"When I noticed this torrent (three months ago) I nearly fainted from joy. I downloaded it painstakingly over three weeks... don't worry, you'll get it anyhow. As an Indian, let me tell you, there is nothing like this out there, tho' the depiction, as the detractors say, is highly stylized. 
Thanks a lot to the uploader..."
,sahajyogi,2008-03-09T21:35Z,Torrent is stuck :( please seed this. I would buy it but the DVD set is about 300 US dollars!!
,23h,2008-03-28T14:11Z,"Thanks so much for this I now have almost 50%, so should have it all in a few days. Saw it on TV in Oz many years ago and have had the soundtrack since then. Always wanted to see it again and in a few days I will. I will leave this to seed for as long as I can afford the disc space.
Thanks again."

It will be worth the wait."
,prodigy9,2008-09-09T06:37Z,what can i do.  Downloaded but have no audio. Have codec AC3.  What else should i do.  Tried playing on winamp and divx.
,SpunkJiVE,2008-09-11T23:48Z,"Do not waste your time downloading this politically correct, multiracial transcription - even the Indian actors do not act or behave  as true Indians. Awesome story, sadly rendered trite?????.. "
,zeinabqureshi,2008-10-21T10:04Z,"@SpunkJive:
Not really about feelings, but are you a Martian, by any means? `Politically correct' Ha! High praise indeed! Have you watched the *Indian* version (I mean the 100-odd episodes of the sitcom)? Then you'll perhaps see the light. "
,odenallfader,2008-10-21T21:45Z,I saw this one on swedish tv several years back. It's awsome. Best ever!
,Krokkedille,2008-12-07T21:00Z,"How is the quality of the Xvid, (resolution) and (Bitrate) 
Is it allright compare to DVD-R ?"
,23h,2008-12-09T05:28Z,The last 2.3% seems to be a problem. 5 or more time the DL has finished only to check and drop back to 97.7% and start to DL again.
,23h,2008-12-12T01:13Z,"Disapointed! Took forever to DL and now I have a similar problem to prodigy9, no audio.

I am using VLC as my player, so any suggestions to hear as well as see this masterpiece would be appreciated"
,zeinabqureshi,2008-12-14T05:38Z,"Can't understand why so many have reported problems...this even plays on my cheap DivX player...the only serious flaw of this rip is that it is split into two UNEQUAL part - unequal in terms of resolution and quality, I mean. 

Thanks again to toronto_bengali."
