Description: 

The victorious Allies entering Germany in 1945 began a project never 
attempted in history before - to create a functioning democracy from
the ruins of a defeated people and a defeated nation.

With powerful human interest narratives at its heart, this film tells 
of the experiences of the liberators and the liberated - both their
successes and their mistakes.

We reveal untold stories of the occupiers - a shocking period of terrible
chaos, corruption and confusion. We uncover desperate suffering amongst 
the occupied, but also find tales of fun, freedom and ultimate redemption.
