Chief Architect 9 has new features that include advanced, photo-realistic rendering using the latest Ray-tracing technology (includes reflections and radiosity, providing the most realistic images available in the CAD software market); new Glass House? view provides a fully translucent view of the interior and exterior simultaneously; Material Painter? allows users to apply materials to individual objects in 3D or render views; Improved walk-through tools including support for AVI files; over 8,500 new library items; improved material list editing and more.

A feature that makes Chief Architect unique is its Build House Wizard? which allows a user to select the number and types of rooms desired in his/her floor plan, arrange them, and with a click of a button, Chief Architect will convert the design into an editable floor plan. Another feature that sets Chief Architect apart from any other 3D architectural design program is a 3D Model Maker as it allows a user to print a plan to scale and assemble a physical 3D model.
