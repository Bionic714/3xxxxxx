IT (Det) By Stephen King SWE/ENG SUBS

Thanks to "dulist" that made that great torrent http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3393451

This is just a shrinked, burnable version of his complete 7,9 GB dvd.

The reason is ofcourse that we have a lot of friends out there who..dont now how... dont have the time.. or just dont wont to shrink it by themself..so here you have a iso file with great Q..but no extras.. only swe/eng subs.

Credits go to "duelist" for a great torrent...thanks man.

And friends.. I am seeding.. just dooont have the pooower to go faster..

(telia 8/1 adsl)..so be patient.

Keep on seeding
