This is my first "release" ever, so I apologise for everything in advance.

This torrent contains three files: the anime film _Flying Phantom Ship_, broken up into two parts, and its trailer.

The anime (entitled _Sora tobu yureisen_ in Japanese), was an amazing 1969 collaboration between Japanese and Russian directors; it pays homage to many of its genre contemporaries and ancestors (namely, Astroboy and Scooby Doo) and - the cherry on top - Hayao Miyazaki was a keyframe animator during its production.

The video was ripped by me from the best VHS source I could acquire after an exhaustive Internet search of early, pre-computer-assisted fansubbing productions (thanks go out to Hikarichan for providing me with the source). I then digitized the video, did a two-pass noise reduction clean-up (unfortunately, about the first five minutes of the film are affected by some sort of Macrovision-type copy-defeating sound modulatioon that stops pretty quickly). Finally, I did a two-pass XviD encode in Gordian Knot, which gave me a file at the 576x384 resolution, with VBR MP3. I then cut the 1.24GB file into two smaller files (647MB and 628MB, respectively). The runtime of the film is just a little over an hour. I put the trailer included at the very end of the VHS tape through the same process and got a 74.8MB file at the same quality setting.

I hope you enjoy this anime as much as I enjoyed it when I first saw it (when I was very young).
