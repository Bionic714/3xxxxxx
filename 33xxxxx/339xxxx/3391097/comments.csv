,NeoThe1,2007-08-17T06:47Z,"Unfortunately, I no longer have a copy with me. However, if you look this anime up on AniDB, you will find that eDonkey shares of it may exist."
,forever77,2011-01-30T19:27Z,Does anybody have a finished copy of this? I'm at 91.6% so if someone could just seed for a little while i'd be eternally grateful
,forever77,2011-01-31T19:55Z,"Please keep seeding! at 95% now. not sure why its taking so long but it wont download faster than 2k/s, and its rare that it goes that fast even though theres a client with a 100% of it"
