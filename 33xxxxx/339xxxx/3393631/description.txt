un chien andalou by Luis BuÃ±uel
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020530/
English subtitles are included, they are burnt on to the film print, yuck!.

This rip is taken from the BFI release, see above link.
The quality of their print is really not all that great, and I get the impression of a slight cropping of the image, but it is by far the best quality version I have ever seen, so here it is.

Also I think you all should know that ive knocked up a website: 

it has a list of all the films released here so far, and a link to a message board, I don?t know if anyone will be interested in using it, but ive found it quite useful when trying to keep track of what films have been put up here and what else should be made available to us all, maybe some of you will find it useful too.

Do you like really fucked-up, weird flicks? Cool! Do 'symbolic metaphors' give you a tingle?
Does the name David Lynch mean anything to you?
Do you watch movies *just* because you can't pronounce the director's name?
