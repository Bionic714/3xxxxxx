,younso,2006-01-05T21:27Z,I have dl this torrent and was wondering how to burn this in Nero. What I am supposed to do with rared data files?
,Kijyo,2006-01-13T16:32Z,"RAR contains the data track found in disc 1. You can make a Mixed Mode CD (aka Enhanced CD) compilation in Nero to burn audio and data on the same disc with one session (volume name in NFO).

Also check out ncore's other releases @ http://thepiratebay.org/search.php?q=ncore"
