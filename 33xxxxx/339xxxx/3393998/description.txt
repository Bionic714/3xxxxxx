This is the original 1972 ABC movie of the week "The Night Stalker", with ace reporter Carl Kolchak tracking down the killer of a series of mysterious murders.

The Night Stalker was such a big hit it spawned a sequel in 1973 called "The Night Strangler" (which I will also be uploading), and a TV series from 1974-75 called, "Kolchak: The Night Stalker", and now the new 2005 TV series "Night Stalker".
