This is a retail rip and repack from XbOxFrEaKz, the new release group formed by shady 78 himself.

Midway Slug 4 & 5, good wholesome side scrolling action for all....then uhh x2, cause like, theres like 2 games. saw we still needed a release with both games in it, so here it is for those of you who missed them or one of them the first time, this is just a .rar with both .iso's (the retail copy had a disc for each game, so with that 2 .iso's are formed.
