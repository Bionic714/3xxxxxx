Technical stuff:

-Subs: Finnish, swedish, english, french, and german .(Unlike allmost all finnish DVD's this one doesnt have danish or norweigian subs. Sorry about that.)

-I removed all extras but still had to compress movie file to 80% of original size in order to fit one DVD-R. I have propably the slowest internet-connection in Finland (only half-meg upload),so upload in original size would take forever.

-This is my first ever torrent up-load, so there could be 'technical' problems. Apologies in advance if I manage to screw it up.
