,Quandar,2006-07-07T18:29Z,"Sorry can't help. I still have the DVD, but when I try to copy files to hard-drive I get ""CRC error"", something wrong with the DVD altough it still works with DVD players. Hopefully somebody turns up and helps."
,ozzie123,2008-01-10T18:39Z,The movie is excellent quality but I cannot figure out how to get the English subtitles to work. I tried opening the .srt file but get an error message. Any other suggestions? Thanks!

,froggykodok,2012-05-11T08:55Z,"Guys, with srt files, you have to put the movie and the srt file in the same folder, and rename them so both files have _identical_ names except the srt ends with .srt instead of .avi or whatever the movie is. The open in windows media player and the subs will run automatically."
