Astronauts Gone Wild
In this DVD, Bart Sibrel interviews nine Apollo astronauts. Watch Neil Armstrong refuse to take $5,000 cash to swear on the Bible that he really walked on the moon. Others punch and kick when confronted. Be prepared to squirm in your seat as you feel deep embarrassment for the astronauts as they try to lie their way out. We recommend that you watch A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon before you watch Astronauts Gone Wild.

A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Moon
Surrounding the earth, beginning at an altitude of 1,000 miles and extending an additional 25,000 miles, lie lethal bands of radiation called the Van Allen Radiation Belts.  Every manned space mission in history (including Mercury, Gemini, Soyuz, Skylab and the Space Shuttle) has been well below this deadly radiation field... all except Apollo.  Recently uncovered footage of the crew of Apollo 11 staging part of their mission proves that the astronauts never made it beyond earth orbit.  The goal was to fool the Soviet Union about US strategic capability during the height of the Cold War.  Deceit, Greed and Injustice... A sad thing happened on the way to the moon. The truth will astound you!
