,Parias,2006-04-16T14:10Z,Thanks for sharing this video. Since I think of actually studying psychology this is of great interest for me.

,DrutterFun,2006-07-28T01:34Z,to the 1st guy... bout quality... when I launch it and put my hand on the screen the default video screen size is almost like my hand but without the last fingertips... and anyone know about any other courses/lessons/video guides... I like to learn ;) I can recemmend if ur interestin in  dating females try to search for David D. Double Your Dating...it's book but it's also a DVD (he has several dvd's like meeting them in bars and clubs etc..)
,SBC,2006-08-07T22:28Z,"Double your dating? What the hell?

These videos aren't as helpful as I thought they would be. Almost everything they covered was either common sense, or something you can easily learn from a high school psych. class. The video quality is great, sound is great, there's nothing wrong with the torrent, they're just not as informative as I thought they would be. Some of the subject matter's still pretty interesting and thought provoking, but deffinately not 2 gigs worth of thought.

These are fun to watch and deffinately educational, but they seem very dumbed down. If you're actually interested in Pyschology, these videos aren't going to help you very much. It's worth it to spend some time watching these, but it took me almost a week to download them all. They're not worth that much time."
,RedWizzrobe,2007-06-15T07:43Z,I hope this works.  I'm taking a general psychology class and am too lazy to get these videos from the library for my assignments.

,hadnarev,2008-02-18T03:54Z,"I'm a psych professor and teach Introductory/General Psychology among other university courses. In my opinion, this is by far the best you will find for telecourse videos--there are several much worse. SBC mentioned that they were not very helpful or ""dumbed down."" I would agree to an extent, but would like to point out that they are not intended to be used by themselves but with one of the Hockenbury and Hockenbury textbooks. They are meant to introduce the student to the content that they will learn about in more detail in the textbook and/or class. As introductions to the content, they do very well, especially with the excellent interviews with experts and the way they apply the concepts to the real world. "
,r4wmunt34q,2008-03-30T22:27Z,"Thank you for these great videos, though the quality isnt very good. It is interesting,watchable and understandable I think, so it is worth downloading..."
,Alpocalypse,2008-07-17T16:07Z,"Thanks dude, we should also invest time in educational stuff rather than porn:))"
,diabol,2008-08-19T12:54Z,"i fully agree and i also hate porn.. or well, at least most of what's being seeded on TPB (some have hundreds of seeders tho they're shit.. so as you see, we are *not* educational)
this is fun stuff, but judging from the comments it isn't worth downloading"
,bonrbombz,2009-03-19T14:46Z,"I needed this for a Psych101 course, and you saved me some serious dough on this one. Much kudos to the poster!!! To those of you criticizing the documentary, this is a distance learning program, not an entertainment documentary... there is a big difference."
,jonna007,2010-07-05T22:29Z,"thanks a lot !
Do you have Anthropology series(3 courses) from the same coastlearning.org,
