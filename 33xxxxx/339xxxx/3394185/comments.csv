,FlyMan21,2008-07-07T08:56Z,"hey hows it going, i downloaded all 3 games and and it runs but when i try to do a skirmish or a multiplayer game it says i need a cd. how can i fix this?"
,fisk0,2008-08-24T03:01Z,"so these are the expansion packs only?
if that is the case, it's great, since I am already a legal owner of the original game without expansions (which are almost impossible to find in any stores nowadays)."
,DocNielsen,2008-09-05T15:28Z,"yes. download the two other images as well, then install from CD1, and use this disk to install the expansions, then update the game to version 3 with ta1x-31c.exe or ta1x-30.exe"
,jjelhombre,2008-09-10T16:39Z,Hi there. Is this download still working as my pc doesn't recognise the file as any kind of installer
,DocNielsen,2009-02-19T16:09Z,"It is a Nero CD image (NRG)
Use Nero, Alcohol or Daemon Tools to mount the disk, and install it."
,DocNielsen,2009-09-23T12:01Z,"It's been almost 3 years, and i'm still seeding this ;) Hope you guys are too"
