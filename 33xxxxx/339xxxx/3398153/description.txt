This torrent contains a compilation I've made of live & rare Fantômas tracks.

From the very first Fantômas track (a T. Rex cover from 1998, with Mike Patton playing every instruments) "Chariot Choogle", to the brand new track "Animali In Calore Surriscaldati Con Ipertermia Genitale". It has a radio version of "Experiment in Terror", a track from a John Zorn compilation called "Zemaraim", and even a Björk remix of the track "Where Is The Line"

The live tracks consists of covers of such band as Butthole Surfers ("Cherub"), The Gun Club ("Promise Me" (sung by Buzz Osbourne from The Melvins)), Al Green ("Simply Beautiful"), Slayer (a medley of songs from the "Reign In Blood" album), and an alternate version of "Experiment In Terror".

Tracklisting are as follows:
1. Chariot Choogle (1:48)
2. An Experiment In Terror (Radio Edit) (2:25)
3. Zemaraim (3:36)
4. Where Is The Line (Fantômas Mix) (5:28)

Hope you will enjoy this compilation.

Sincerly,
