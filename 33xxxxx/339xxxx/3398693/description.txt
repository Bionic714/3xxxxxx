Shortcut PhotoZoom Pro (formerly known as S-Spline 2) is a software program that promises to resize your photos without losing any quality. You can use it to interpolate, or blow up, your images to larger sizes. At the end of 2003 I needed a program like Shortcut PhotoZoom Pro for two reasons. I wanted to create a 30x20 inch print at 254dpi from a Canon EOS 10D source file, and I also needed to interpolate some 10D files up to 48Mb in size for submission to an image library. So did Shortcut PhotoZoom Pro deliver on its promises? Did it create a quality print for me and were my stock images accepted? Find out in my review.
