:: Mini-image for I-Ninja.SFClone-MiRROR ::

Since i had problems to make mini-image from the original iso
('invalid image file' error), i've made new iso with Alcohol 120%,
cut out the contents of newly created .mdf file with UltraISO,
made new mini-image and to my surprise, it works perfectly.


Instructions:
1. Install the game
2. Run SFNightmare.exe located in /SFNightmare dir and:
   - Disable your CD/DVD drives (read StarForce readme for help)
   - Disable Node
3. Mount the mini-image (ININJA_1.mds) with Daemon Tools
4. Run the game, use serial 7U9L5U-VZYE3C-NJ4ZF3-LWY69A
5. Have fun ;)
