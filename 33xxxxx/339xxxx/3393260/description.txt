How to Play this DVD on your DVD Player:
   1) Verify that your DVD Player supports 480x480 format.  Generally speaking, 
   any DVD player that supports VCD or SVCD will work.  Some DVD players 
   (especially newer or fancier ones) will also handle this.  Your DVD player
   must also support burned DVDs, of course.

   There's an unofficial list here:

   2) Burn the VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS folders onto the root of the DVDR using 
   your favorite burning software.  Most people seem to prefer Nero, but there 
   are free programs out there too like CDBurnerXP Pro.  Here's a guide for
   burning with Nero: http://www.digitalfaq.com/dvdguides/authorburn/nerodvd/nerodvd.htm 

What to do if your DVD Player can't Play the DVD:
   1) Consider purchasing a new DVD player that specifically supports 
      480x480 format.

   2) Hang onto the DVD - Someday you'll have to get a new DVD player, right? :)

   3) Play the DVD on your computer.

   4) Reauthor it yourself.  You'll have to reencode it to 720x480 which will 
      make the size go up and/or the quality go down.  The VOBs are the same 
      source files I'm working with.

How to Play this DVD on your Computer:
   BEST - Cyberlink PowerDVD.  http://www.gocyberlink.com/multi/products/main_1_ENU.html

   It works great and costs $39.  (You can also dig it up on the Torrent Sites 
   if you swing that way.)  Just install and register it, and then open 
   'VIDEO_TS.IFO' to start the DVD.

   GREAT - VLC Media Player.  http://www.videolan.org/vlc/

   It's really nice too and it's freeware.  A must have is your broke but not
   morally bankrupt too.  It runs on Windows, Linux and Mac.

   Just unzip the files and run vlc.exe.  In VCL, Choose File -> Open Directory
   and Browse to the VIDEO_TS folder.  Once the game is started, choose Video ->
   Deinterlace -> Blend to eliminate any horizontal line 'artifacts' you might see.

   OK - Media Player Classic.  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=82303&package_id=84358

   Another Freeware Player.  It's ultra fast and small and makes a nice 
   alternative to Windows Media Player.  It does have built-in DVD support 
   (File -> Open DVD), but I just prefer PowerDVD or VLC Player for DVDs.

   BAD - Windows Media Player.  http://already.installed.on.your.computer.bloatware

   Free and does an poor job with DVDs.  The video looks SIGNIFICANTLY worse on
   both my computers using Windows Media Player 10.  It's just really big and
   clunky and slow.  You can buy DVD plug-ins for it, but why bother, honestly...


Comments:

This is the fourth collector DVD of the 2005 series.  I will be releasing these 
professional quality DVDs for all the Buckeye games from now on.  The quality
of the video is identical to the DirecTV digital broadcast, so you won't find
better quality and compression anywhere.

I have about 50KB of bandwidth that I'm going to try to keep a seed available at 
all times.  With 12 games on the schedule - including the Rose Bowl :) - I really
need people to be good about seeding for a REALLY LONG time or else I'll be 
uploading the Rose Bowl DVD @ 4KB/sec.  (2KB/sec when we win back to back MNCs)

Want to get involved?  I'm always looking for good highlight videos.  If you want
to make them for the DVD, just PM me and I'll provide my some of my video files 
ahead of time.  I'd love to have 1-3 per DVD :)


Seed Seed Seed!  Please try to seed at least 200% - it's the only way this 
project will work.
