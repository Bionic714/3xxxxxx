synopsis: In My Skin is a haunting and riveting exploration of the human body as a boundary --and a battleground -- 
between the individual and the often unreachable world outside.  After suffering deep gashes to her leg from an accidental fall, 
Esther (Marina de Van), a young research analyst, becomes preoccupied with her body and skin, 
especially her wounds.  At first she merely caresses her arms, pinches her excess skin, or traces the cuts on her legs, but it 
isn't long before she is carving wounds directly and aggressively into her own body.  Her boyfriend (Laurent Lucas) becomes 
understandably concerned and angry, but his inability to understand forces Esther into reclusion to explore her newfound practice. 
With increased urgency, she turns an unapologetic knife or razor upon her own skin.  Marina de Van, who not only stars but also 
directed and wrote In My Skin, has long collaborated with François Ozon, acting in See The Sea and Sitcom, and co-writing Under 
The Sand and Eight Women.  With In My Skin, De Van joins a group of directors including David Cronenberg, Georges Franju and 
Roman Polanski who brilliantly imagine the physical manifestations of their character?s innermost torments.
