This worked fine for me.  I got the dmg image and then used Toast 7.1.2 (whatever the latest is) and mounted it on desktop and it worked fine.  I had never mounted a disc before using Toast.  You can do it 2 ways:  go to utility while Toast is on and select mount disc image, select the image you want and then click choose or you can Mount  and Image with Mount it, hit control click on image file and then choose mount it from the menu that pops up.

Once mounted it will open fine."
