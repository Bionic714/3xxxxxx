Description: Based on Gunter Grass's Nobel-winning novel this is the astonishingly strange story of Oscar Matzerath. At the age of 3 he feels unable to face up to reality and decides to stop growing up any further. Thus he remains forever a midget and becomes a witness to the rise of nazism in pre-war Danzig while beating incessantly on his tin drum in defiance to the works of his elders. Striking and bizarre yet powerful and moving - this is an unforgettable film.
