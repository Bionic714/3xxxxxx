Credit should be given to MINT for this release. Thanks for this, I almost thought I wouldn't get an AC3 version of episode 5. Great series.

Was a bit frustrated trying to locate episode 5 with AC3 audio. There was a version by CTU but the audio was out of sync.  I got this version by MINT from the Emule network and am happy to say I now no longer have a hole in my Rome AC3 collection.

<sigh> what sad lives we lead.
