Being There, starring Peter Sellers, Shirley MacLaine, Melvyn Douglas and Jack Warden, is the story of Chance, a half-wit gardener without identity, thought or passion whose only knowledge of the world comes from television.  When Chance is suddenly cast into the 'real' world, he inadvertently stumbles into the inner circle of governmental power brokers who are frustrated by the status quo and eager for fresh, new 'sage' wisdom and political leadership.

As he blithely meets billionaires, politicians, press and beautiful women, Chance's simpleton expressions are misinterpreted as concise and contemplative insights.  What results is biting social and political satire of Shakespearean proportions as our unlikely hero survives a series of challenges that he doesn't understand, using words that are both universal and meaningless.

Regardless of your politics, anyone can appreciate the topical relevance of a tale about a well-dressed simpleton, adopted by Washington's rich and powerful and prone to empty rhetoric that is interpreted as having deep meaning qualifying as leadership.
