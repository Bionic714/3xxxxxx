,johnlee120,2009-04-19T04:21Z,@ jerryant. How the fuck is this film educational? It glorified a racist cowardly murderous gang the KKK dumbass. There is nothing educational about this. It's a distortion of American History and a racist portrayal of blacks. 
,Nohg,2009-04-30T00:22Z,"Yeah. American History.

Educational. Learn about History. Slavery and such is  a part of history. Be mature about it and accept that it happened, and it's over."
