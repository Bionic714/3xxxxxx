,Freakishbob,2006-09-14T04:31Z,actually schooly D and mc chris are the guys who do the music for aqua teen hungar force.....but mf doom and danger mouse are still really freaking amazing
,Fenix_OP,2008-06-24T23:10Z,Actually it's Spoonie D and his son that do the tracks on Aqua Teen. And I think it's... MC Chris (?) that does the raps for MC P-Pants/Sir Loin/etc.
,Fenix_OP,2008-06-24T23:15Z,"Oh snap FreakishBob you beat me to the punch lol. And yes, SCHOOLLY D is the name, my bad."
,chicago_skyline138,2008-12-25T23:40Z,"thanks indierock, another similar artist you could add is Viktor Vaughn, its another one of MF Dooms alias's. He's on three different record labels, one is rhymesayers which everyone on the label could be considered a similar artist..so check em out indierock and everyone else!!"
,skanman14,2009-03-25T02:01Z,"i think sayin he sounds like anyone else from rhymesayers is a stretch...murs and atmosphere?...not really but great indie hip hop nonetheless...the other label hes signed to- def jux- is raw as hell, names like Edan, aesop rock, Mr. Lif and others...real eclectic stuff, check them out"
,mwheel,2009-04-07T07:22Z,MF DOOM is Zev Lover X from the group KMD. If you want some really good stuff from mf doom you should download the king geedorah albums.
,teuful,2009-07-18T09:19Z,"Good stuff, but it's not unedited."
,nDALLAS,2011-09-02T20:29Z,"mc chris is great, fette's vette! i gotta check out schoolly D? "
