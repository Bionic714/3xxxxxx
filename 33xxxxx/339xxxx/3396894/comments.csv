,d5005,2009-04-30T22:37Z,"I'm stuck at 88% (and my net is very slow)
Could anyone seed, plz."
,d5005,2009-05-01T20:52Z,"For the ones who can't open it:

You have to use a program like winrar or PowerArchiver to extract the ISO file from the spanned rar files. Then, you use the program DAEMON TOOLS or any other that emulates a CD rom drive to open the Iso file as if it was a burned cd.

Anyway I wasn't able to open it because it keeps saying to insert the Cd. I see there's a crack file there, but I don't know how to use it. Other people are having the same problem.

Help! Plz!"
,Levethian,2009-06-23T18:23Z,"For everyone having issues using the crack / needing CD - I'm pretty sure the crack.exe from the ISO is simply copied over to the G-Police directory and double-clicked...

Simples :)
Thanks for the upload - nice memories, and perfect for UMPC's (given that this game doesn't need a mouse.. and is old)."
