"Earth?s resources are completely depleted, and the race is on to claim every ore-bearing rock in the solar system. War breaks out as opposing nations compete for ever-declining resources and expand their military capabilities in space. Colonies live in spectacular cities contained within huge geodesic domes. While multi-national corporations unite to exploit space, Earth?s coalition government creates a multi- national force to keep order in the colonies. The G-Police are born. Jeff Slater joins the G-Police to investigate the mysterious death of his sister.

More stunning graphics from Psygnosis! "It's night time, you're hovering between two skyscrapers. You think you see something below, but it is too dark to figure out. You fire a missile towards the street, and sit in awe as everything is lit up in spectacular colors." Stunning graphics, to say the least! 35 missions will take you through 5 geodesic domes. Your assault chopper has tons of weapons, and don't worry, you'll need them all. Progressive difficulty.FMV movies and narration. For once, you've got a chopper you can really fly!! Is it time to worship Psygnosis yet?"
