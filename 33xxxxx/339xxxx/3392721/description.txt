This is a short film depicting the character "Milton" from Office Space.  It takes place behind the movie, depicting poor mumbler Milton's life.  His revenge has been spiced up a bit, so it's worth a watch! >:P
Seeders are always appreciated.

If you haven't seen Office Space yet, GO CHECK IT OUT! It's one of those rare comedies that's extremely amazing. The story is also great.
