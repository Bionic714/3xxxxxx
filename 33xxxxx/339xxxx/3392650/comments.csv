,wissamitter,2010-11-16T14:37Z,"I'm sick and tired of looking for good quality of this TV Show, So I purchased the DVDs for season 1-5 and I'll rip them myself into great quality of size 350MB per episode. I should receive the DVDs in about 7 days from today (Nov 17, 2010) and will start ripping from season 1 - 5 eventually, but it will take sometime, so please be patient. I will post them here on pirate bay every season in a separate torrent starting from season 1. My upload speed is only 100Kbps, but still better than nothing i guess. Because my upload speed is low, you guys have to promise to keep seeding my torrents when i post them. 

Let me know what you think by emailing me at wissamgumtree@hotmail.com. You can post suggestions and thanks there also. If you would like to make a donation to help me recover the cost i paid for the DVDs feel free to let me know on that email, if not that's fine, i just do it to help everyone.

Piratebay trackers won't allow people to connect easily to seeders (or at least that's what i noticed after uploading another torrent before). What can i do to make seeding better? If you can help with advise feel free to let me know as well."
