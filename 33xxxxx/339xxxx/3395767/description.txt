I'm a fucking borderline myself, I need love like blood, I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely I could die, I've been thrown away like shit off fileheaven the place I shared tens movies, I've been kicked while I needed love and beg for love thru my illegal dvdrips, and I've been kicked out from the underworld like I was before from the "normal" world, I've been so closed to death I wanted more than anything, without any smile back to bring me back to life, I've been so hated I could kill everybody around, I've been looking so much for love like air on Mars, I've been so hurt I prayed everyday God to free me from this world, and he never did that bastard asshole, I did had so many reasons to live from drugs, alcool and hope to die soon, more than any human glance, women have become so selfish and men so violent, I'm all lost on this planet dreaming of an human-free island, with only animals and trees, and no more suffering from you, go on and I can become a real danger for you, no more heaven ahead for me, just pain, pain, pain and some day a way out, at last my deathday, so many times I dreamt about these last seconds before I get free from YOUR ugly world, oh please let it be soon, I'm so tired of seing days empty of light everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday of every year, every seccond of every minute, every beat of my heart...

Don't you come whining about unsharing while I'm the uploader, while you're all unable to share - I know what I'm talking about, FZB is a big heart, all alone in his small flat in a big big big empty city...
