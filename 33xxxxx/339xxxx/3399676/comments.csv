,yebesu,2009-04-21T19:26Z,"I created an account at tpb just to tell you thanks! These books are not only a breath of fresh air, they are also a huge sigh of relief from the monotonous 'pound it into your brain' methodology used in nearly every other book. Thanks!!! I would have never found it without tpb which is truly a vital element of the world's cultural vitality, evolution free association and exchange. LONG LIVE THE PIRATE BAY!!!!"

,Ghost5748,2010-05-10T18:33Z,"The torrent for RTK3 listed here is missing a page containing the characters 2838, 2839, and 2840. While you could just manually add them or look it up elsewhere, I would recommend downloading the following high-quality torrent of RTK3:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4908202/Remembering_the_Kanji_3__new_ed.


For those of you who would prefer to add the missing Kanji manually, they are as follows:

2838 :: Dust :: ?
2839 :: Foot of a Mountain :: ?
2840 :: Giraffe :: ?


Best of luck in your studies!
