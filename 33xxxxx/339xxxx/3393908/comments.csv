Sarcasm. It's fantastic."

,dexterdexterstjock,2008-11-15T12:58Z,i recently dled this and burnt it onto dvd to play on my dvd player which supports divx files. unfortunately neither of these would play on it and i don't know why. i've never had this problem with any other movies i've downloaded. does somebody know how I could change the encoding of the movie to something my dvd player supports?
