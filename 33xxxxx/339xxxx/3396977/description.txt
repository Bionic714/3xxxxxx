Invision Power Services is proud to announce that new versions of Invision Power Board and Invision Community Blog have been released. Please see the reply to this topic for information about the Invision Community Blog release

Invision Power Board (IPB) 2.1.2 is a maintenance release which fixes several bugs which are listed further down this announcement.
here are two important changes in IPB 2.1.2.

The "conf_global.php" file has been removed from the distribution and replaced with "conf_global.php.dist". This is to ensure that you don't accidently overwrite your existing conf_global.php file when upgrading. If you are installing IPB for the first time, you will need to rename the 'conf_global.php.dist' file to 'conf_global.php' as noted by the installer.

The skin cache system has changed slightly so that the PHP cached files (found in cache/skin_cache/cacheid_x) have a class name in the following format: {file_name}_{cache_id}. This means that you MUST perform an upgrade to allow the cached templates to be rebuilt. If you do not allow the upgrader to rebuild your templates or don't manually rebuild your templates then you will receive PHP parse errors.
