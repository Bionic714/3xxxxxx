Thats right DIPshit. Any KEYGEN is basically SPYWARE, according to worthless programs like Norton and Mcfee.

So use NOD32 and if it says ""Tool"" then it is not a virus, it is actually what it says it is.

However, even if I am wrong and this fukkin thing does have parasiteware built in, it also looks like it has the original programs, so just FUCKIN delete the viruses if you are so paranoid."
