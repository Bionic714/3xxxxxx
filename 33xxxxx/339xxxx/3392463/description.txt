Live in Miami 16-Oct-1976 except tracks 14 and 16, which are live in New York 31-Oct-1976. The sound quality bites it on the New York tracks, and "Muffin Man" is supposed to be especially abominable. The Miami sound is "quite excellent" on Volume I, but not so good on Volume II. Very silly colour covers with non-1976 photos on the back. Released in 1987 and 1988.
