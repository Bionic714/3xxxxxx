it just say that you need the cd"
,guggen_90,2006-09-14T15:38Z,help anyone?
,brothasaint,2006-09-15T04:23Z,"If I understand this correctly, when you try to start the program it says you need a cd.  I had this problem as well, even with the actual cd.  When this program installs it memorizes the drive letter that it installed from.  Make sure the cd drive or emulation drive is the same one that you installed from.  If that doesn't work, try installing and running from the ""D:"" drive"
,guggen_90,2006-09-16T23:18Z,"it aint anything to mount from the installed folder:/
ant more tips?"
,brothasaint,2006-09-18T05:58Z,You're going to have to explain the problem a little better.  Try going step by step.  
,mthe1vwgolf,2006-09-28T18:21Z,does this actually work yes or no
,TeamPlayer,2006-12-09T17:41Z,I'm stuck at 97% would someone please seed this.. TIA  :)
,stevelowry,2007-06-02T21:50Z,burn to cd ok but when i try to install i get a unknown error at six percent and the install program closes any ideas  thx
,morphman86,2007-08-02T12:08Z,"I had no problem installing it, and no sd-errors whatsoever, but the colors are all messed up and it's impossible to play, since you don't see anything!"
,scorchedurth,2007-09-11T01:56Z,"My comp indicates that there are files missing when trying to run trek.exe, mp97.dll is the one I'm really stuck on. It's a Microprose file, And since they don't exist anymore, it's kinda hard to find. I'll just buy the CD off eBay. Good effort though for a great game."
,darkdaz,2008-05-11T12:42Z,"regarding scorchedurth's last message

if u have missing files like the one you said about, goto google.com and type in the dll name ie windll.dll whatever it maybe. and search

there is a site which contains a load of dlls and other files which sometimes windows doesnt have, or installations programs for games etc, install, 

when u got this search, it should come up with a website eg www.dll-files.com this site contains the dll files required or ocx that aint always installed installed..

good luck with it all..

note to uploader: thanks"
,TYRRAM,2008-05-13T06:00Z,you know you need to know a litle bit about PC's to play stolen PC games. Ever hear of deamon tools ?
[T],xxThugxx,2008-05-21T01:09Z,So many fucking noobs in one place lol NICE UP brothasaint  WORKS LIKE A TREAT lol
,SSN688,2008-07-15T00:23Z,For play use DEAMON tool (virtual CD) it is OK.
,Tyrram999,2008-09-21T09:05Z,"and power iso and magic iso and etc, etc. You have to mount these games on a virtual drive if you dont have the actual cd. Most people use daemon tools but i prefer power iso myself. "
,kmce,2009-02-02T23:33Z,what do i open this with
,kmce,2009-02-04T23:34Z,can some one talk me throu what to do ihave got power iso but cant get it to work
,Tehmulletman,2009-03-02T07:43Z,if it tells you you need a CD to run anything you should download a no-cd crack from gamecopyworld or somewhere...
,termite43,2010-10-08T18:49Z,"This works Windows 7 x64 but you must have the image mounted in order to play.  There does not seem to be any no-cd .exe available.  I haven't had any issues with sound or graphics.  If the graphics get messed up, run the game inside a fantastic little program called 'D3D Windower'.  It runs older games with low resolutions inside a window on your desktop.  I use a 40"" TV so 1024x768 doesn't actually look so bad.  Ever tried Anno 1602?  Did you get bright pink, yellow and blue for your colors?  D3D Windower fixes all that."
,DragonChaserKev,2011-02-03T10:45Z,"I'm no techno wizard but inabout 10 minutes was running fine on Windows 7.  After being a long time fan of Master of Orion 2 I was really looking forward to this game as I understood it was very similar to MOO2 but watered down.

Similar in a lot of ways but quite different.  So far am finding BOTF to be more difficult a game and also a little slower moving.  Still a pretty addicting little Trek game.  Thanks."
,aussie_guy_84,2011-07-11T04:28Z,"Hi guys...
Downloaded the game but unable to play it, game downloaded as a VLC Media file.... any ideas how to fix it up so I can play???"
,Bigblueelf,2012-03-05T07:03Z,Hi. As far as I remember if you patch to 1.02 (I think that was the last patch) then you don't need the CD. I am trying to think back a few years so I maybe wrong but I don't think I am.
,whiterussian74,2012-03-17T18:45Z,"Running Win7 64-bit. The Autorun and Setup both stall during launch. The cursor spins few about 20 secs. then stops. When I try to unmount from Daemon tools, it tell me that there are open handles. 
What should I do differently. Does this not run on Win7 64-bit?"
,-Distance,2012-06-23T05:40Z,Worked fine for me dunno why people are having probs .. thanks brothasaint missed this game!
,Mahler2,2012-07-21T16:50Z,"Ok people, easy peasy...

1) Mount the .cue file (the one that shows up as a vlc file) in Daemon Tools (or Power Iso, Magic Iso, etc.).
2) Find the mounted image in ""my computer"".
3) Right click the drive where the image is (there should be a starfleet icon in place of the drive icon) and click ""Play or Install Media from this drive"" (or something close to that.)
4) Install the game
5) To play the game, repeat step 3.

*note: to play the game, the image must be mounted.

ST: BOTF has lots of potential and can be extremely fun but it takes hours of learning how to play to reap this benefit. The tutorials don't walk you through in game, you have to follow the manual with it. In all, this game was too much for me and I just didn't have the patience to learn how to play."
,midian36,2012-08-01T23:08Z,i tried the steps and got to step 3.  When I right clicked and chose install it said canceled by user.  I tried again and nothing.  I tried auto play and nothing.
