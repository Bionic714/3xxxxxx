STAR TREK: The Next Generation Birth of the Federation is the first PC CD-ROM strategy game based on the rich STAR TREK universe!

Forged from the cultures, timelines, events and technologies of the hit TV show STAR TREK: The Next Generation, this turn-based epic emphasizes resource management, combat and diplomacy.

Control one of five major alliances: Federation, Klingon, Romulan, Ferengi, or Cardassian, each with its own set of abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Encounter over 30 exotic races. And beware, there lurks the potential for a Borg invasion -- threatening ALL players!
