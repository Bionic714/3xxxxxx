,Zebu Fellenz,2006-01-13T00:07Z,Is it only protected against burning to dvd; are you still able to mount with daemon tools w/ all options on 
,Maskros,2006-01-13T21:41Z,"Piece of shit, can't get the bloody thing to work, tried all i can think of, even installed bloody alcohol... (shitty program imo), but this bloody game won't start, someone who's got a crack??"
,zaphod_zoeller,2006-01-17T17:00Z,"ok, any sensible person wanna tell me if this is crackable, before i bother to start? i assume it is starforce... the only question is which version"

,ijr777,2006-01-21T14:44Z,someone please explain how this works please
,newbury,2006-01-24T16:45Z,"Ok, let me get this straight therefore is no way of getting this game to work that does not involved unplugging CD drives, using StarForce Nightmate, etc? 
And ""M3g4 m0n573r"" I tried to used Anti blaxx but its having none of it. Have you managed to get it to work with Anti Blaxx?"
,VidamiC,2006-01-28T20:41Z,"I dont understand a shit:P I tried to follow the ""Instruciones instal.txt""......... when I start the game something like ""please put your CD in another drive... help!"
,newbury,2006-01-29T16:15Z,I'd just buy the game. The protection is not worth faffing about with if your new to this sort of thing.
,Monzter,2006-01-30T12:21Z,"It worked the first 7 days ore so for me, but then suddenly an error says that the cd-key doesen't correspond to the disk in the drive. How hard can it be to crack a game :)? Is it inpossible to crack this game? It's the best game i ever played..."
,Nik0s,2006-02-01T17:40Z,"Guys what do i ahave to do to play GT Legends? I put the seriual and then it says gathering sytem information and waits there.

Now what?"
,loke.nor,2006-02-06T19:43Z,"I can't get this to work. I always get ""error"" when the game is checking the disc. I have done all in the installation manual - many times:-("
,Nik0s,2006-02-07T12:58Z,"Same think here friend. When i input the serial then the game does soem cheking and stucks there, it wotn proceed.

Please someone help us."
,Oldfart(fin),2006-02-10T09:48Z,"The game works fine, just disable the cd/dvd burners with starforce nighmare, or manually unplug power cables..(disable cd,node and that ide channel where your burner is connected) and mount  the image with new daemon tools (4.03)"
,Nik0s,2006-02-10T11:28Z,"One thionmg that i cant understand is why all new games need alchohol or deamoin tolls  and dont just   a crack to replace the original .exe and then work.

Can someone please explain me that?"
,Oldfart(fin),2006-02-12T10:23Z,maybe the starforce is too hard to crack.. it takes time
,SantaHul,2006-02-17T00:39Z,"i've beaten all the other shit but the serial number is wrong. as it says in the text file, those instructions are for worms 4. granted the starforce technique is the same but the serial is no good, which i assume means that unless somebody tracks down the person who created the original torrent and finds out what the serial is then we're all fucked"
,lornejl,2006-02-21T23:47Z,"i have a dif version,,but  try 
FFMGU-HA34Y-V8ABF-VUN3Y-SCTRP
it accepts the serial,,then tells me to put in correct cd,,grrrrr"
,loggboken,2006-02-27T10:07Z,working without any problems just mount it in the newest deamon tools and play ;D

,vitalic,2006-03-04T18:04Z,"hahaaa!

piece of cake this.
just follow the readme! file.
great game, thanks for the serial

greetz"
,vitalic,2006-03-05T16:17Z,"oke, here is what you should do!

Install daemontools4.
Before mouting the GT legends Image run Sfcure, just do em all.
When finished turn off your computer.
Disable the IDE cable and the power connector from ALL your cd/dvd drives.
Start your computer and mount GT legends and install the game.
When finished start the game, the game says u need to reboot, so you do that.
When back in windows again start the game, enter the serial and play the game!

piece of cake

greetz"
,P0lisen,2006-03-09T09:58Z,Just Use Deamon Tools 4.03 and mount then reeboot and you can play it

,Oldfart(fin),2006-03-10T17:48Z,"as I said the game works fine, instructios are here and in the info file, If it doesnt work for you maybe its better to buy original game or just buy a console and play with that!!"

,MazterX,2006-03-14T20:45Z,"Anyone that have a serial, Can you PM me with it? Thx"
,holymahogny,2006-03-16T14:34Z,"thx for the torrent, I have tested the demo and the game seems good enough:) info-file was good but a little vague on the ""starforce nightmare""? having problems with this part of the installation:/ does anybody know how to do this part??"

,Bmw_7serie,2006-06-27T21:53Z,please seed
,MisterPresident,2006-08-09T12:48Z,"This torrent works just fine. Here is how I got it working:

1) Get Deamon Tools 4.03 and install
2) Mount the .mds file
3) install game, but do not start it yet
4) turn off pc, remove the IDE cables from all your optical drives, ie. dvd and cd
5) now start pc and play the game

use serial FFMGU-HA34Y-V8ABF-VUN3Y-SCTRP

NB. the downside of this is that you have to dismount your optical drives every time"
,Linds,2007-01-06T17:58Z,Serial nummer is wrong... ?
,nickme,2007-01-27T21:59Z,"Seed plz..
I want this game so bad, so i hope you seed :)"
,nickme,2007-02-02T22:24Z,someone knows where i can find the crack?
,MRTeamet,2007-03-22T21:41Z,"Works very well, just follow the readme file and change cd-key to 
FFMGU-HA34Y-V8ABF-VUN3Y-SCTRP 
Worked just fine for me, but the game is boring. "
,noekk,2007-03-24T07:28Z,"I didn't download this because I really don't want to deal with StarForce but did anyone try this StarForce code:

JGCTH-3N3VF-GU8R2-2EM79-W3TZ7

Please PM me if it helps."
,xiIix,2008-01-12T13:12Z,"Guys, there IS no crack. There IS NO no-cd exe for this game. You HAVE to disable or disconnect your DVD drive. For me starforce nightmare and sfcure has always done the trick, and it runs fine. There is always going to be some trial and error on some different machines, but essentially, if all else fails, just turn your PC off, pull the molex power connector from your DVD drive, boot up, run sfcure and starforce nightmare, and it will work. 

If it doesn't, then you need to reinstall it correctly using the RMPS option with daemon tools. Also make sure you don't have a newer version of starforce installed. If you do, UNINSTALL this game, remove the new starforce driver (you can fined instructions all over google for that), and then reinstall the game using the starforce that's included with THIS game."
,viaggro,2008-03-05T19:50Z,"Guess what? I've got the factory cd, and have the same, f**kin' problem, time to contact the factory"
,bruntkuvert,2008-08-06T01:13Z,"This is what i did.

1. Dowload the torrent
2. Mount with daemontools
3. Install the game
4. Reboot
5. Start the game and enter the serialnumber
6. Play!"
,drjacko,2010-02-26T20:43Z,A great game. Worked like a charm.
,k-d-k,2010-04-02T06:35Z,"Use this torrent:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5368534/GT_Legends_v._1.1.0.0_-_whitout_StarForce_-_Play_whitout_DVD_...

This version of GT Legends is without Starforce in the Version 1.1.0.0 and works on Linux (Cedega, crossover office/Games & Wine), Win7, Vista, XP and on Mac"
,James_patageul,2010-04-24T14:36Z,"big problem for me...
no more booting. hopefully i made a full image before installing this."
,drjacko,2010-06-04T12:57Z,"Hey all, i am in a not so funny situation. Earlier the serial key worked. Now it does not. Anyone know why?"
