CD version of very rare UK prog/psych/rock album recorded by this English band in Rome (!) in 1969. Typical late '60's rock with heavy guitar, vocal harmonies and powerful instrumentation. The band are accomplished and the recordings are well produced with superb guitar work and novel interpretations of the various cover versions including "Pinball Wizard" "Tin Soldier" "Society's Child" "Where Is My Mind?" and others. Great! THIS IS NOT THE ANDY LATIMER BAND.
