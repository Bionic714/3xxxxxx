,fid00,2008-03-24T06:14Z,SEED PLZ stuck @ 96.5
,Raep-FIN,2008-06-20T17:16Z,jhrenshaw: At least it's viewable. Btw. it is also easier(faster) to D/L.
,Poppycorn,2009-05-31T17:35Z,The resolution is only 320x240. Looks like it was downloaded off of youtube. But at least this one has seeders as opposed to the other ones lying around that have none.
