,misterdc,2008-12-04T09:21Z,"Okay, surely Im the dumbass here but can you tell me one thing:
Is there any speeking in this? I have sound and music, but there is not a single word spoken (no story teller). With this the comment ""where can I find subtitles"" makes me a little... confused.
Can anyone help?"
,geryatric,2008-12-04T11:42Z,There is no speaking in these films and hence no subtitles -- just enjoy them for what they are
,spen007,2009-07-02T01:39Z,Great Film...
,LightTheRebellion,2009-07-31T00:11Z,To each his own.
