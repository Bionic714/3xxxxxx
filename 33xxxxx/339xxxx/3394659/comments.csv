PLEASE HELP"
,josh_jp,2006-05-16T17:19Z,"Get either Daemon tools or alcohol to run these files on a virtual cd/dvd drive. Alternatively you can use Winrar www.rarlabs.com to open the .iso files individually.

Personally as it uses 2 CD's to install I would use Daemon tools (it's free) to mount both the CD's and install wit ease, cheers, Josh"
