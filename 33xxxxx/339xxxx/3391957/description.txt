This is the legendary musicvideo that goes around on the internet with the Norwegian group "Hurro Torpedo" who plays rock and roll on guitars and oven, fridges and deepfreezers. 
I watched them on a gig in Bergen some years ago. I can with the bottom of my heart... that it rocked!!!

Those who puttet this video out on the net (revhughes.com) has nothing to do with
the group or the persons behind it. Just some lamers who take credit for putting
the video out(The song and "video" istaken from a Norwegian fun tv show "Lille LÃ¸rdag" 10 years ago.).

Have fun.
