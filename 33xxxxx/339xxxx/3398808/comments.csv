,manti6999,2006-01-25T20:28Z,Plz people seed this torrent i want to watch it. i dont want to stop at like 80% and never dl like i always do with smallville
,Mupp_Gonzo,2006-01-28T17:02Z,smallville sucks
,MeatPopsicle,2006-02-18T03:48Z,"Lol thats not really the point is it? Despite the fact that it doesnt, this isnt the place to say!

Manti was just makin a polite request, why does everything have to turn into a flame war?!"
,Mupp_Gonzo,2006-02-23T00:14Z,"Does anyone have the last episode (Gaz, taster of pork) as dvdrip?"
,Happy Camper,2006-03-02T06:15Z,No but for reals though... hes right... smallville does suck.
,DamianGTO,2006-03-11T20:40Z,Please Seed this.....
,illive,2006-04-08T21:31Z,"I downloaded the torrent, but I have no sound -- what's up with that?"

,yell0,2006-05-09T03:58Z,"the IVTC was done improperly on these rips... anyone wanna upload a dvdrip that was done right? The sizes are also way too big considering how short most of them are. 160MB for 12min? Should be about half that, even with the same resolution."
,yell0,2006-05-09T04:36Z,"OK. Here is the problem with Invader Zim and some other stuff like interstella 5555
The cel content is IVTC'd, but the pannings, etc is not.

it's really, really evil, and there's no way to deinterlace it properly to restore progressive frames- it is, at its root, fully interlaced.

Rips of this show should NOT be IVTC'd. These are... and it's very obvious whenever there is a quick pan..."
,yell0,2006-05-09T04:45Z,or rather not deinterlaced at all... full dvdrs really are the only solution... or just leaving it in it's native resolution
,yell0,2006-05-09T06:44Z,YATTA is the program to use at that url...
,yell0,2006-05-09T21:18Z,"The exact problem is this:

The cel animation is done at film 23 fps. The pans at 30fps.
(continued..)"
,yell0,2006-05-09T21:19Z,"Often times when there is a pan, there are awful looking blended frames that appear along with jerkiness. Look at it frame by frame, there are plenty of examples of the blended frames I'm speaking of in the first episode.
(continued...)"
,yell0,2006-05-09T21:21Z,"You need a container format and codec that supports varirable framerates.

There is a reason anime nerds use the .mkv container format. (It's not like you can't do xvid/ac3 in an .mkv ;) that's what most of them are anyways)"
,yell0,2006-05-09T21:22Z,"Too bad everyone is so stuck on .avi, you can't easily do varirable framerates on an .avi. The IVTC settings in whatever program Snek used were set wrong too for this kind of animation.
(continued,,,)"
,yell0,2006-05-09T21:24Z,"For animation, a codec and container format that supports varirable framerates should always be used just incase. Or.. just do it at a straight 30 fps..

I would highly advise using the tutorial here:

http://guide.zhentarim.net/

and to use YATTA for IVTC'ing stuff like this.

(Sorry for the earlier confusion guys, I didnt know what I was talking about. But after consulting some experts on this, these are the answers I got.)"
,bibliophage,2006-05-13T19:48Z,Please seed!
,yell0,2006-05-14T02:40Z,"Why? It's a waste, the blended frames and jerkiness sucks."
,helloguy56,2006-05-31T00:23Z,"yell0 i dunno what the hell you are yapping on about but no one here cares. These rips are fine and great quality, if your not pleased then make your own rips."
,thesnitz,2006-09-05T20:32Z,can someone please seed this?

,svampen88,2006-10-05T15:08Z,I looked every where for this xD NICE..!
,soccerboi,2006-10-08T21:24Z,"I dunno what all you guys are complaining about, there is nothing noticeably wrong with them.  Maybe they are larger than normal, but who cares if its good quality.  "
,Mupp_Gonzo,2006-12-03T10:02Z,"The problem with http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3402756/Invader_Zim_-_Missing_Files is that it is not a dvd rip =(
If anyone has a dvd rip of the episode ""gaz, taster of pork"", please upload it!
And if someone have better dvd-rips, upload them as well- then maybe we can make mr. jello happy =)"
,oldschoolrockstar,2007-06-20T07:41Z,"Nick said that they apsolutly loved the show, but the only reason why they had to cancle it was due to ratings. It sucks that Nick has all the rights to invader zim. Would be nice to have it back on the good old boob tube where it belongs. "
,luminary07,2007-10-16T13:33Z,"my audio didn't transfer with this torrent.

,scumocide,2008-02-17T01:17Z,"Anybody know of a way to make this work on itunes, for my ipod? "
,AggroPirate,2008-03-16T22:42Z,"I also did not get any audio in this torrent.
wtf?"
,slash213,2008-03-28T11:45Z,"Guys! Stop cutting your up/ speeds already. I give about 500kB/s and get only 100kB/s or something.

It's kind of vital to get at least 200 before my connection goes down. :("
,kmiller8,2008-05-02T02:17Z,"I can't get ANY speed from this torrent, I'm connected to alot of seeds and peers, and I kno my connection sucks, but i've been dlling this for 2 WEEKS and finnaly is at 97.8%"
,ImPrettyMuchSexy,2008-05-12T05:59Z,Ugh... 6.5kbs... normally I am at 550ish...

,BugMan26,2008-07-03T09:32Z,[ac3 codec] get it from theoneX for those complaining w/ the audio END.
,Firebird88,2008-07-28T22:51Z,"i just downloaded this...
its a pretty funny cartoon.
its a shame that they had to put down the show...:S"
,CryMaker,2008-08-13T23:53Z,"Oldschoolrocker. thats wrong. 
Jhonen Vasquez the writer of Invader zim was on Acid ( LSD ) while he made the shows. then he went to rehab, after that he tried to make more shows, but they werent the same so he quit. 

I hope he drops acid again and makes those shows again"
,Project_Spam,2008-09-13T00:06Z,"@CryMaker Jhonen Vasquez dident go to rehab for acid although he probley did enjest in some.
Nick canceled the show mid way through the second season i heard there was going to be a movie made as well to fill the rest but alas never happen. show was canceled because it starting getting worse and when they would tell jhonen ""hey u cant put this in its too scary"" he would say well we did worse in the first episode.... example in episode jhonen wanted a picture of a bloody gir nick said no no so what happen later was jhonen put the bloody gir pic into single frames of almost every episode after that just to fuck u this is my art. if u put in freeze frame u can see them one is in bad bad rubber piggy in the time portal at one point you can see it."
,StashTheTech,2008-12-03T03:34Z,"i remember when this show was still on nic, to bad they pulled it for crap rateings, this is a must have for any cartoon junky, thanks for the download, ill be seading as soon as its done uploading."
,KasrkinCK,2009-01-23T01:08Z,Thanks for the BEST Zim torrent out there! I can no longer watch my imported Zim DVDs and I've struggled to find the episodes in such good quality! This is amazing!
,starsofdraco,2009-04-14T23:59Z,This has alot of negitive comments should I bother downloading this torrent?
,arkangelusxblade,2009-04-15T01:42Z,"Okay, despite what some of you are complaining about, someone spent a good deal of time making this available to us, so the least we can do is say thank you. So, thank you, snek. Much appreciated. Oh, and if you play these using the VLC media player, they're fine. VLC is pretty idiot-proof."
,walrusdealer,2009-04-20T05:21Z,"downloaded, audio works fine
everyone having audio problems, sounds like you don't have ac3 codec installed, get it from here: http://www.wmplugins.com/ItemDetail.aspx?&codec=2000
that should fix audio issues"
,tvland4us,2009-05-15T15:59Z,"thanks, been wanting to watch this"
,ajtheman,2009-06-10T06:45Z,"Excellent torrent, have downloaded this a few times actually. Had to reformat my computer though so I'm going to download it again.

And I don't download individual codecs, I just pick up the K-lite codec pack. Just google it, it has all the codecs you could ever need, and you can use whatever media player you want. Cheers!"

,Xeokym,2010-04-10T19:41Z,"there are 47 episodes and this has 46, so yeah, it's missing an ep. Also, to torrent-starters, for fuck's sake would you INDICATE WHEN SOMETHING IS NOT IN ENGLISH?! It's so fucking frustrating to download something only to find out it's in some other language!!!"

,auriuman78,2011-04-25T06:50Z,Oh come on be happy you're not paying for it  :B   I recommend vlc or kmp.  You can get the missing episode elsewhere... I already did!
,Persona_Alio,2011-05-13T01:43Z,"This, compared to 3606907 and 4873848 (torrent numbers), has the best video quality. I highly recommend downloading this torrent, and then just getting an alternative download for the missing episode (and the pilot, if you wish). Also, this torrent *is* in fact English."
,jdoekro,2011-06-07T21:24Z,"Torrent file is bad.
If your torrent client refuses to load it, edit it with hex-editor and replace at the beginning ""announce-list"" with ""xnnounce-list"" or some other garbage so the malformed announce list is ignored.

Thanks for the rip, SNEK - the quality is great."
