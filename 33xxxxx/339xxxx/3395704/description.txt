Ashampoo WinOptimizer Platinum Suite2 is the great new successor to the hugely popular Ashampoo WinOptimizer Platinum Suite. With an all-new interface and many new features it gives you an unbeatable package of cleanup tools that will keep your Windows® installation lean, mean and running smoothly.

Just as dirt and trash accumulate in buildings and factories in the course of time, unnecessary data and "leftover files" gradually collect in all Windows® installations as you use them. As this garbage collects it slowly clogs up your system, taking up space and making performance slower and slower.

This is partly a natural process and partly the result of the way Windows® is designed.

Ashampoo WinOptimizer Platinum Suite 2 is like having your own personal cleaning company for your Windows® computer. Like a professional cleaner, the program knows exactly what kind of dirt to look for, where to find it and how to get rid of it efficiently and without damaging anything else.

With the new user interface and many new features you get an unbeatable collection of tools that make your Windows® system fast, easy and safe.

Ashampoo WinOptimizer Platinum Suite 2 has 13 powerful easy-to-use modules for cleaning, tuning and optimizing your Windows® system!

All functions are supported in Windows® 98, Me, 2000 and XP!
