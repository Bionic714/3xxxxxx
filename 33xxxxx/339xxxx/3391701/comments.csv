Video plays but no audio"
,dark_gantoris,2008-10-12T02:47Z,The standard response is usually: get AC3 Filter for audio
,Kjelsaasbjornen,2008-10-19T04:36Z,"For gods sake, please people!
Use VLC, if that doesnt work - use another mediaplayer, dont write fucked up comments just because ur a fag that dont know how to do anything!!"
,butcherboys,2008-10-26T03:24Z,Works perfect. Sound and audio. If you have issues check your codecs. Don't slam the file because you have no clue.
,vivatpb5776,2011-04-29T15:33Z,"The sound is fine; however, just so you are aware, this version is tagged with, ""Property of Lionsgate Entertainment."" It first appeared about 3:20 minutes into the movie. Also, this is full screen (512*384)."
