Thanks"
,62Olds,2008-01-22T05:45Z,Don't bother to down load unless someone else has 100%.  Been setting at 65% and waiting to get the rest.  Would keep seeding but I'm just about ready to give it up.

I need this,but I can't found it anywhere.
This movie is nice,I love the monster trucks racing in the 80's.
If someone have some 80's monster trucks movies - films please upload it."
