Description: A day in the lifes of a writer and his wife. They attend a party where they mingle with the rich and powerful. He is offered a job, to write the history of a firm and in this way "educate" the workers. The workers of a constructing firm described by its owner as his own "work of art". Both get enamored by strangers and see the opportunity to end their marriage. Their partaking in the dolce vita and silly games of the burgeoise and their attempt to reassert themsleves in the world of the rich leads to a deep crisis in their relationship that forces them to confront the emptiness in their lifes, the detrimental effect of their monotonous urban habits and the loss of true sentiments in a world overrun by material values. An exquisite work of art by Michelangelo Antonioni.
