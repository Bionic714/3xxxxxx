Round Trip to Heaven (1992) Corey Feldman Zach Galligan PAL DVD-R VHSRip

I was looking through some old tapes and found this movie recorded during my adolescence.
One thing that got me interested first was the Opening song sung by Stan Bush of The Touch fame.
I looked it up online and found only 1 release, on VHS, in the USA, so I thought I'd transfer this to Mpeg 2.

Video: Mpeg2 720x576 25fps 1725mbps
Audio: Mpeg2 224mbps stereo (mono source)

See the Sample for an example of the quality.

It is ready for transfer to PAL DVD.
