Glenn Branca (born 1949 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) is an avant-garde composer and guitarist.

In the early 1970s, Branca began experimenting with sound as the founder of an experimental theater group in Boston called Bastard Theater. He moved to New York in 1976, and his early music was performed in No Wave bands of the late 1970s, namely The Static and Theoretical Girls.

In the early 1980s, he composed several medium-length compositions for electric guitar ensembles, including The Ascension (1981) and Indeterminate Activity of Resultant Masses (1981). He soon thereafter began composing symphonies for orchestras of electric guitars and percussion, which blended droning industrial cacophany and microtonality with quasi-mysticism and advanced mathematics.
