Registration is required to view the screenshots.  Why is registration required?  Because I add all of my torrents to thenudeboard.com before anywhere else and they allow the uploading of my screenshots.  Is registering worth the 2 minutes it would take?  Well, if you're interested in having gigabytes of amateur content at your disposal then you probably wouldn't mind the quick free registration.
