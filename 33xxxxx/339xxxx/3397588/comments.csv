,Pericles555,2007-03-29T08:25Z,"the ending scenes displaying the grazing horse through a sheet of rain, are supposed to fade from black and white to color, a sort of cinematographic signifier symbolizing 'a new beginning', unfortunately in this version this wonderful moment is cut. "

Use ConvertXtoDVD if you want to see it on a standalone. It's a great rip, and it's the *real* version (Criterion)."

,psichoate,2011-07-25T03:37Z,"edit: i see you have a skull for other uploads but not this one. Not sure i understand how that works exactly, but...props!"
