,monkeywar,2007-06-16T11:52Z,"could anyone tell me why season 1 seems to want to playback with the ""video"" both upside down and back-to-front? is there a codec or something i need to donwload?"
,woozy8,2008-03-25T07:58Z,"^^^^
Up where it says Files: 62 - click the number, then wait for the file list to load underneath ""download this torrent"""
,anshin,2008-05-16T22:52Z,Anybody else having problems with twitchy playback?
,Kon-Foozed,2008-06-19T21:29Z,This is my first trip to Twin Peaks as it were and I thoroughly enjoyed the first series and I've just started the second and I have to thank Keine Beschwerden for putting this up. Shame about the second series being slightly less crisp than the first but still very watchable. :D
,A_minor,2008-07-19T11:33Z,"Please remember to seed.  If you quit, please jump back on for just a little bit."
,LezDawson,2008-10-03T19:28Z,This is the best Twin Peaks rip on TPB!  I can't believe most of the others are full DVD versions and not DivX rips like this one.  BIG thanks to Keine.
,LezDawson,2008-10-10T00:05Z,"Man, I do appreciate the rip - but you've got your aspect ratio all wrong for the 2 seasons.  You set it to 720 x 576, but you should have used 720 x 544 for the most accurate 4:3 setting (divisible by 16).
Still, very good rip, thanks man."
,chardo138,2008-11-08T07:33Z,Is this done in some different format other than avi? Do I need a codec or some kind of software to play files? Why did you do it like this.
,FredDK,2008-12-12T20:29Z,"Hi people! 
Please seed some more! I've been stuck on 27,1 % for so long time now! I'm uploading more than I'm downloading. And I can't wait to see the second season!"
,chardo138,2008-12-19T23:25Z,Dude wtf? I found a better konektion I have been patient with this f'n download why aren't you seeding whats going on?
,Smuggles,2009-03-19T00:22Z,Thank you.
,Smuggles,2009-03-19T00:24Z,tackar
,pyatachoks,2009-03-19T10:32Z,Aspect ratio is less than 4:3. It leaves two black vertical stripes on both sides of the picture. Hasn't anyone been bothered?
,pistolslug,2009-04-10T00:12Z,"BEST UPLOAD EVER!
thank you for putting twin peaks back in to my life the wonderful dialogue of this genius series captures and expands the imagination.

Through the darkness of future past 
The magican longs to see 
One chance out between two worlds
Fire walk with me "
,chickensaladisgood,2009-07-22T23:17Z,"Big thanks to Keine Beschwerden for the upload.

Those bothered by the incorrect ratio for the first season - view using VLC player, and simply click 4:3 in the video options. Simple."
,axel_aj,2009-09-11T15:02Z,Are there any subtitles to these?
,catchow58,2010-02-06T07:33Z,"Holy shit, has it really been 20 years?  In the back of my closet, I probably still have the whole series on VHS tapes I recorded myself, even if there's nothing to play them on.  Without Twin Peaks, would we have ever gotten the XFiles, or even Desperate Hoiusewives?  It's a fair question to ask."
,Jaymer,2010-02-27T02:27Z,"check a sample, this torrent is from 2005 and might not be the best encode. It's grainy and glitchy so a later rip or full dvd version would be worth the better "
,Yoni__,2010-05-16T19:04Z,are there any subtitles to these?
,TheSasz,2011-02-16T20:44Z,thanks you ;)
