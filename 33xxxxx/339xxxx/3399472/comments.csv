lame_enc.dll modified to use INI File Setup: This dll uses an '.ini' file to set up the preset, Scalefactor and Experimental Y options to be used in encoding. This is designed for use with applications that use the dll but do not provide full preset support. This version provides support for all 20 VBR presets and preset INSANE. See the enclosed text file for usage. (ICL9.1)
