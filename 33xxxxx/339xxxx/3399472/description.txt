Tunebite is a Windows software product, which, once installed on 
the PC, fully automatically or manually records the music that is 
purchased online as the music will be played back. It is completely 
legal to record and playback on a different reproducer of yours. 
Tunebite is technology-proof, does not bypass any digital copy 
protection and therefore conforms with all digital copy protection 
measures, provided that the user is legally entitled to listen to 
the music.

* This is the latest version released... has digital dubbing capabilities
4x for windows supported songs(wma...) and 2x for itune. This means that it can record songs 4x faster than real time recording in windows and 2x fatster than real time recording for itune songs.

Enjoy
