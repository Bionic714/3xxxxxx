Yea, this mixtape comes from my boys at Nu Rap America/Nu Rap Worldwide.

Short and sweet, if you're lookin for that new UK/London rap to get into, this is the tape to do it. He does it in Volume 1, and returns with new beats, artists, and remixes feat Dizzie VS Asher D battle, Cassidy Grime Freestyle, December 4th Remix, and smash hit UK/US remix "Get Lower" .

Fans of Dizzee Rascal, The Streets, Asher, and hiphop in general etc, this is that 2006 music, mixed EXCLUSIVELY by Nu Rap Worldwide label mate, DJ Dopeman.

this is his 2nd tape with the NRA worldwide division, showin his mixing and blends skils with USA artists over UK beats, or UK rappers over US rappers, showin true props and his DJ skills throughout the tape, and skits from the movie "The Football Factory" and others.
