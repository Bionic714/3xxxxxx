,Sp4c3c0wb0y,2008-06-09T01:09Z,"--->Young Aztek
You will have to have a modded anything to play it on anything other than your computer, and even then you'll need the emulator,Even though you don't have to have the emulator to play on the PS, or Ps2, Because the Ps2 will detect that it doesn't have it copyright info on the burned disc, so it will have to modded so your Ps2(or PSX) doesn't know the difference."
,Danny-JR,2008-06-15T20:54Z,"I agree totally, series 1 is the best, they get worser as tiem goes by"

,revengfulx74,2009-07-26T23:23Z,"anyone wanna help me out?

i downloaded the game, got the emulator and the plugins for the configuration, but when i start the game it says im missing pixels and render texture. im new to the psx emulation thing so can anyone help out?"
,UpGraDD-DoubleDose,2010-03-14T23:34Z,you people do know romhustler.net has alot of playstation isos but its in parts which is pretty inconvenient 
,shafie94,2011-01-16T20:32Z,"guys, i play this game with psx 1.13, use it, is easy to use and never crash"
,blackkatana,2011-10-26T20:52Z,"Would be nice if somebody seeded this -_-
psx 1.7 is a great and easy to use emulator, but you'll need scph1001 bios (load to bios portion) and some weird dll - zlib1.dll.
you can play ps1 discs right off it, but i found sound and graphical glitches. you can take ps1 discs and extract them as iso to solve these problems and play them perfectly.
that said, SEED THIS >:0"
,blackkatana,2011-10-26T21:06Z,"works great. thankyou.
You can always seed this from me."
,ExcelsiorX,2012-05-06T11:35Z,can someone seed please?
,ZalmoWeed,2012-06-17T18:12Z,"Working for emulator, but not working for consoles
