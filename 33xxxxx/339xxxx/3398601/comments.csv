,runningdeer,2010-07-28T00:30Z,"I use FSX. Currently the only decent Lockheed L-1011 is made by Perfect flight. The exterior model is awesome, I like the flight dynamics also. However the panels really suck...the ground steering is screwed up too.

After googling I saw this package and the L-1011 promises to be really nice. So I guess I'll have to reinstall FS9.

Has anybody gotten this to work with FSX? Or know of a way to convert it? 

Thank you uploader :)."
