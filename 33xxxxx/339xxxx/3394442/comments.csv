,mightyjim20,2007-03-08T18:24Z,"This is my first try at downloading a torrent. Well, third but I did it wrong before. Hopefully this will go well. I shouldn't want to be rude and not return the favour, so can someone explain how to seed? (If it is what I think it is anyway!)"
,mightyjim20,2007-03-08T18:25Z,This is my first try at downloading a torrent
,mightyjim20,2007-03-08T18:38Z,"Oops! It very obviously IS my first try at this, sorry to come across thick."
,anamortia,2007-08-15T03:39Z,"Can someone seed this?  this download has been going on for more than 10 hours and seems to be stuck on 99.9% 

Is there something I've forgotten to do? 

Thanks"
,anamortia,2007-08-15T03:48Z,"Hmmm... it's gone back to 99.7% again, for the 4th time, guess it's time to kill this torrent and try again.   Before I go to sleep, I think... 
"
,anamortia,2007-08-15T05:31Z,"All is well; even though it didn't show 100% of the torrent, I knocked it offline and opened the dmg.  Lo & behold it uploaded just fine, with  the chewy caramel center (the thesaurus!) intact.  Yippee! 
"
,wonderwot,2007-09-19T19:55Z,"I've installed, but it won't allow me to open word documents.  I've got a 30-day trial on my computer, so i placed it in the trash to see if my new (permanant) copy would work before tossing out my limited copy.  When it did not work I've held onto the trial.  Any suggestions about how to get the new one to work? -Thnks"
,gillsberrt,2007-11-18T19:58Z,how do you guys download this because when i download it.. it goes on limewire.. and that takes forever.
,elmervaca,2007-12-24T04:34Z,hey guys to all ya know that this torrent is fucked up when its about to be completed it returns 1 mb back and never gets completed it's like a never ending fucking cycle. so do not wate your time.
