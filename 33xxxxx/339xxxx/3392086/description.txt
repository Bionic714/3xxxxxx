The Phoenix Records version has a deluxe colour cover. There are altogether 3 or 4 variant covers. A version in a plain white cover with plain white labels has also been reported, as well as white labels with printed side numbers and recording info written in pen. One informant described one cover version as a "black and white cover, with blank labels on the record. The cover consists of Frank's face on the front in sketch style and Frank holding a torn umbrella in front of a bulldozer, it looks a little rough in the printing side of things."
