,Casmus,2006-10-01T19:28Z,Somebody please seed... I've been stuck at 83.3% for a long time now... 
,Casmus,2006-10-02T10:00Z,"Alright, I finished downloading it, thanks to all who seeded... Now I have two problems.

First, how do I get it into the game?
And second, when I try to seed it myself, I just get a message that says ""a sharing violation occured while accessing"". :/"
,Aleks_oslo,2006-10-21T13:12Z,Please seed!
,Jackass Jimm,2006-11-07T03:14Z,this IS the No CD.  They(deviance) seeded a torrent for Quake 4 but the No-Cd crack doesn't work.  Hopefully this works.  DL'ing it as I type this.  I've already tried the one that came with the torrent and one from soemone else...both do not work.  Hopefully this one will
,Jackass Jimm,2006-11-07T03:16Z,"On thing, 


You take the file that is in this (a quake4.exe) and you put it into your Quake 4 directory (whereever you installed it).  Press yes to replace the old file with the new one.

Then jsut press it...it SHOULD work."
,Jackass Jimm,2006-11-07T03:24Z,"Game still crashes for me..even with this no-cd ...

so, I've tried 3 different ones and all three crap up on me.....guess the game doesn't want to work on my system

Anyone has had this problem and has fixed it?  Please tell.

""Quake 4 has encountered a problem and needs to close.  We are sorry for the inconvenience.""  

Taht is all I get.  Please help me.  I love quake (I still play quake 2 online with DM, Sheridan, Rocket arena 2).  ho hum."
