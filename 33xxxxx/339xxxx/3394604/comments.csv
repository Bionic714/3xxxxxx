,Xenity,2006-11-02T01:58Z,!This torrent being tracked by a movie studio.  Do not download - unsafe!
,mutual_aid,2007-01-03T16:57Z,"unfortunately this torrent will live because it's all over the place, not just at tpb, so a lot of people will jump on this torrent not seeing your comment ever....  and with only 1 person (of 2755 snatches) writing, i'm a little skeptical it's being 'tracked'.  Anyhow, thanks for the heads up"
,glenno231,2007-04-25T17:12Z,"The video is fine, but for some reason there's no audio. Any suggestions ?"
,paul.nightday,2007-12-09T16:24Z,no audio - AC3 codec
,radradrobotank,2008-01-26T05:11Z,"AC3 codec is a pain. I wish uploaders would code the audio when they do the video (AC3 is a codec used on DVD video) :) If you have this download, the audio _should_ play in VLC. If you want to burn it you'll probably have to recode the audio track (at least my burning software doesn't deal properly with AC3 audio on XviD video)."
,radradrobotank,2008-01-26T17:07Z,"To follow up on my last comment...

The audio is fine in both VLC and QuickTime for me. I haven't tried burning this yet but, like I said, I've had problems in the past with Toast burning DivX/XviD with AC3 audio. I was able to re-encode the audio using VisualHub (Mac only). I don't know what program to use for similar functionality on Windows because I try to avoid it :) In case anyone doesn't know, VLC is a free, open-source, cross-platform (Windows, Mac, various versions of Linux) media player that will handle just about any file type or codec."
,radradrobotank,2008-01-29T04:21Z,Never mind. This burned fine with the AC3. I must have just had a bad file last time I had an issue with that.
,Mentat_Abbas,2008-02-17T16:39Z,"Good movie, good rip."
,carnageINheaven,2009-12-06T07:49Z,This rip is not even worthy of a mention...its totally dark and grainy...I will look for another one...
,Eskijoe,2010-01-07T00:51Z,Could somebody seed please? I'm stuck at 98.3%
