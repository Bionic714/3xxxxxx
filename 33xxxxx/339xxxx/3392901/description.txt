Description
============================

Using "Talisman", you can build any interface for your computer.
"Talisman" hides the standard desktop of Windows.
You create and add almost any type of object to the Talisman desktop, and attach 
any type of internal Talisman commands or run any application. Objects 
(which can be either visible or invisible) can be programmed to react to 
mouse clicks or mouse movements. You can also add background pictures 
to the desktop and add sounds to different events. All settings and pictures 
are stored in a theme file. You can even make more than one theme and use 
objects with links to go from one theme to another. 
You can use Talisman as your default shell instead the Windows Explorer.
Talisman has its own startup ,system tray, taskbar and startmenu procedures.
