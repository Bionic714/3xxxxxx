Also, if you (or anyone) has the Santa's Playlist album by Sister Hazel I would really like a torrent of it."
,fuzzyballs84,2008-12-11T14:02Z,It's not all of their releases. It doesn't have Before the Amplifiers (2008) or Absolutely (2006). I would also appreciate the Christmas CD if anyone has it.
,mgfritz,2009-08-18T13:43Z,"Thanks a lot for the torrent! Would that be possible to upload the 2 latest albums ""Absolutely"" (2006) and ""Release"" (2009 fresh new album)?? Thank you!"
