Title: Kafka
Director: Steven Soderbergh
Year: 1991
Language: English
Codec: Xvid

Description: In his second film Soderbergh puts Kafka into a quasi-Kafkayesque world where he has to fight against the powers that are his own literary creations. After the death of a friend Kafka decides to investigate the case on his own and ends up uncovering dark secrets hidden deep inside the Castle... Perhaps not the best film by Soderbergh but very interesting nonetheless for its originality, weirdness and excellent cast of actors.
