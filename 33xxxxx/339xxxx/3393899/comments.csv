when i was a kid in the very early '80s, i went out into the countryside and explored and old abandoned farmhouse that had been used some years earlier as a biker pad of some sort. i found an autographed copy of 'the second' in the rubble, and since then have liked S.  - there were also pages from easy rider on the wall and about a 50' diameter 4' deep pile of quart beer bottles (seriously) in the back!  this was when bikers were more into free living, beer, and steppenwolf than today, where they're either yuppies or meth dealers..."
