OK boys and girls, here's the Angelic Upstarts live in Edinburgh on the 6th August 2005. This is another show that i filmed an this line up features none other than Dickie Hammond of Leatherface/HDQ/and many more great bands. So great guitar is guaranteed and add to that Mensi on top form with his "i'm so beautiful" patter and you have a great show from true punk rock legends. I hope you enjoy this even if its not up to my usual standard(Drunk), but its still better filmed than most live shows and this is a great gig with an excellent mix of songs.

Angelic Upstarts - The Wheatsheaf Inn Edinburgh Scotland 6th August 2005 SVCD 80m

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. They will fit onto 2x80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.         http://www.videolan.org/
