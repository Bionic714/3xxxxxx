It's a breathtaking movie, whose place is ensured by the final collage when the poet reclines in front of his villa in Russia and is seen engulfed by the Italian church...this is the most brilliantly taken Tarkovsky film. 

Tarkovsky successfully brings together youth, love, longing, regret, music, the nuclear holocaust, exploitation, marginalisation...in short, he calls upon humanity to redeem itself in the name of what man once was, in the name of nostalgia."
