,bledsoe2000,2005-05-12T16:21Z,Works perfect. One question: U mention 'watch for activation'. How do I go about that? Thanks!
,milkNnuts,2005-05-18T09:46Z,"ok I have a problem with this.
At the Illustrator startup screen, loading stops at plug-ins.
I tried removing plug in files and the whole plug in folder altogether but it still doesn't work.
anybody know a solution to this?"
,milkNnuts,2005-05-19T10:21Z,"I got the program to work. Very nice app :)
but how do u go around the activation?"
,foods,2005-05-21T07:16Z,milkNnuts: Use the keygen.
,saytensays,2005-05-25T01:50Z,"you might want to read up on firewalls and standard internet prectices before downloading warez that isnt really easy to use keygens on ;)
i mean no offence but if you cant figure out how to activate it, you prob shouldnt be messing around with this stuff...."

,Hapzen,2007-04-12T11:31Z,"Sigoras, thats beacouse you have deleted i probably. It's one of the WinRar you get out of the main WinRar. I did that.
