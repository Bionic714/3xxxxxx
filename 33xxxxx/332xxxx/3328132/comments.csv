,SlimT,2008-02-26T20:48Z,"ok, this game was a lil weard when including wog... and i got 2 thing to say!

--------------------------------------------------------

1 There is like no senarios on this, if you want to have all the senarios from Heroes III Complete i got the solution!!
and here it is:

go to

http://data.fuskbugg.se/skalman01/-Maps.rar

download winrar if you dont have it.
extract all the files to directory where to game is 
wait! nonono! in the ""Maps""
folder where the game is
if you overwhright some files some maps will be original from the real game and not from ""wog""

--------------------------------------------------------

2 this is a list of all(almost) the .exe files

h3ccmped.exe - Campaigin Editor
h3maped.exe - Map Edior
H3WMAPED.exe - WOG Map Editor
h3wog.exe - Heroes III with all the things from WOG
h3wupd.exe - Heroes III WOG Updater
Heroes3.exe - Heroes III(with not ALL the things from WOG
heroes3_31_crk.exe - Heroes III(With the most things from Shadow of death and not ALL the things from WOG)
Install.exe - WOG Installer(this shuld allready be installed :P )
mplaynow - Something? MPlayer? well you will need crack or CD for this anyway
sd30to32 - I dont exacly now but i think it is a updater that updates from 3.0 to 3.2 

All the other .exe files shuld just be shit(I guess)

--------------------------------------------------------
