,taijim,2008-04-20T18:32Z,Hi Thanks for the Torrent.  I think this is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  
,passitj,2008-05-13T22:48Z,"Thanks for the upload. 

The sound is good. The picture is not so sharp and I might be mistaken, but I think it is in a weird resolution. Perhaps not the uploaders fault. It is definently watchable, though. 

Thanks again, a rare one. "
