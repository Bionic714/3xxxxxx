,mGoLos,2005-04-22T10:28Z,"I don't know about UFO's, I'm still lacking that crucial evidence which is undeniable to any objective observer.

I've seen much such evidence regarding the true nature of both world wars, OKC Bombing, 9/11, Peak Oil, the coming fall of the almighty dollar (GM will take it down with it) and so on, but not aliens.

Anyways, I know where to look for classic bodylanguage signalling lies and I look forward to watching this, thanks for the upload."
,theonlyix,2005-04-22T10:46Z,"Hmm, undisputable facts for ww2. I seriously doubt that you have all the facts you need to believe in the version that the US and USSR forced upon the world.
C'mon, most of the stuff taught in Swedish schools is russian and american propaganda. I for myself has invested a great deal of sparetime researching WW2 stuff and there is very little evidence for most of the atrocities the world blames the Germans for.
Why does anyone even think that the US and USSR was in ANY way more human during this war than the germans.    ...................    ok enough about that, im looking forward to see this movie.  =)"

Why don't you go spend a week-end  in a German concentration camp, maybe there you'll learn some more about ""very little evidence "" on German behavior.

if your grandpa says that he was the one who discovered the moon. Would you belive him?

The concentration camps surely did exist. But unfortunately, there arent much more proof for their foretold usage as ""gas camps"" except for the Russian propaganda and some ""eye"" witnesses.

If you look at the sheer civilian casualties, the US did kill several times the civilians the germans did, both in and outside ""camps"". The US President even gave a direct order to destroy every german city (with civilians in them). Not speaking of the 2 nuclear bombs the US used on the Japanese.

And i wont even go into detail on the USSR atrocities and genocides. 

Before you even ventilate your  BIASED School propagande, perhaps you should do some research .

Sry to all you others that this had to be in this excellent torrent.

,idefix333,2005-04-22T15:20Z,"Probably you need a new pair of glasses and read again the ""millions"" of names of innocent people murdered by germans that are written on the memorial stones all over the world. But silly me..you prob would say that all those name were made up by the ""evil americans"".



I also want to apologize to the uploader and thanks again for this great realease that is The Disclosure Project.
"
,heson,2005-04-22T15:36Z,"Please watch ""The Fog of War"", the civilian death toll of the nukes was NOT comparably high compared to incinerary bombings altready done on japan (millions dead).

The atrocities in the concentration camps might be exagerated, but even with hypothetical vast exagerations huge amounts of lives were taken. 

The usual revisionist arguments are silly ""Since this claim can be exagerated, everyting must be a conspiracy agains the glorious nazi regime"". 

Oops, Im way of topic but please watch The Fog of War:
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317910"
,theonlyix,2005-04-25T08:02Z,"Im not a revisionist, but as I have come across so many exhaggerations and discovered that so many things I took for granted as the truth (history) about the ww2, i have come to learn that there isnt very much proof of the one thing that makes the Nazis hated.
C'mon, France, belgium and most of the other countries invaded by Germany didnt protest very much...In fact, MANY countries had  great expectations from the third reich.
IF the US and USSR could exhaggerate something to cover their own atrocities during the war, I'm sure they would have done it. And defacto, many of the things about the final solution HASbeen uncovered as bluffs from both Russians and Americans, as well as ""inmates"".
I plan on taking a tour through the ""death camps"" this summer, to check more of the so called evidence. It will surely be interesting.

,dredawg,2005-04-26T02:09Z,"wow! this thread has gotten a little crazy!!  :)  PLEASE enjoy the video and regardless of who killed who, etc...  remember not to fall for the 'Divide and Conquer' mentality that's fragmenting those of us with brains!  

;)

Countries matter about as much as football teams right now guys...  Malmo, Mannheim, Manhattan... forget it, doesn't matter. Don't get distracted tracking the atrocities of the past (WW1, WW2, 9-11, Iraq, Afghanistan, and the list goes on)

One World. One People. Let's end slavery and suffering once and for all!!  Spread the word about the only thing that can do that... The energy propulsion technology these men refer to.  That technology is 'The Destroyer' of all the problems our global society faces. Once that domino falls, the rest will follow.
