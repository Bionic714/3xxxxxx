One of the best navigation softs around..."

,fregattejuetland,2006-02-14T15:42Z,"It is also not possible to install the Charts on CD2 with the permit codes:
02045-54042-45731-81686
08658-57805-82101-56343 and so on

It seems to be that they doesn`t fit to the serial no of the software.
If you install the crack on CD1 you can`t enter any permit code and no charts are availible.

If anybody has an idea to get this running, please share.

tnx"
,Henrylenry,2006-02-21T14:26Z,"I have another version of N-A-7. This one have a patcher as a crack. I got it more than a year ago and it work fine until i installed SP2. Didn´t realise it was SP2 that made this nice program crash.....Anyway i´m about to install SP1 again and  hope N-A-7 will work again. I have WF22 with it and it work fine, also the 3d chart worked fine. 

What about transas 3000? anyone have it?"
,fregattejuetland,2006-02-24T22:05Z,"would be great if somebody could share / upload here WF22.

,Gbriel,2006-04-04T20:59Z,Does this messaging work at all?
,Gbriel,2006-04-04T21:04Z,"Noticed a funny thing on Nobeltec Admiral 7.
I had NADM 7 installed on Win XP Servicepack 2 machine and was hoping to get a working crack for NADM someday."
,Gbriel,2006-04-04T21:05Z,"Then I made an install of Transas Navigator Pro for testing it. Worked ok. BUT, I also noticed that NOBELTEC opened com port for GPS as well...whatta hell...
I cleaned the PC with fresh install of XP SP2. Installed Nobeltec and the crack from Nobeltec 3 CD pack (that has been around on eMule, Bittorrent and DC++ sharing)."
,Gbriel,2006-04-04T21:05Z,"After installation and cracking Nobeltec doesn't start on SP2, so you have to install the newest upgrade for Admiral to version 7.1.900. Now it starts but cries for a site key. Get the version 6 sitekey and use it. Sad about this is that it kills the usage of the charts from 3 CD pack.
Personally I use BSBS/KAP charts that work fine so I don't feel that much pain down there..."
,Gbriel,2006-04-04T21:06Z,"Get Transas Navigator Pro (Transas 2004 ?). Install and crack it. Now you should get a running Nobeltec with OPENED COM port for GPS and NMEA messages.
This has worked on 2 installations for me so I quess it has some sense... I hope it works for more widely as well."
,Gbriel,2006-04-04T21:06Z,"Notes:
Don't try to install Transas to a PC (old Laptops???) with screen 800x600. You'll end up with broken startup of Windows. That's because Transas wants more resolution on the screen.
I bypassed this Transas thing like follows..."
,Gbriel,2006-04-04T21:09Z,"Installed Nobeltec to an old Laptop with 800x600 screen, but didn't install Transas (because I learned from the first try)."
,Gbriel,2006-04-04T21:09Z,Then I replaced C:Program FilesCommon FilesTransas Shared -folder by copying it from the Desktop PC (which had Nobeltec and Transas installed... also had working COM port on it). All in softwarewise runs ok
,Gbriel,2006-04-04T21:10Z,"If someone has newest charts (like World Folio 29), pull'm out for share. It has new areas...including some Nordic inland waters.
cheers"
,xeno_blood,2006-04-16T01:35Z,has anyone got this working with sp2?
,Poker,2006-09-03T13:48Z,"I have the latest World folio charts, will put it up shortly, but they are w/o serials, how to solve that?
NOBELTEC is a great softw, but it would be nice to get rid if the dongle, any ideas?"
,Yrsel,2006-09-13T09:32Z,I have been searching for Navi-Sailor 2400 and 300 but no luck. Any ideas? Please send pm in that case :D
,Yrsel,2006-09-13T09:32Z,2400 and 3000 should it be
