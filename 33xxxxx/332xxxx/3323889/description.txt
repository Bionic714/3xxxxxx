Smart MP3 Renamer is a program designed to rename and tag 
mp3 albums. The program retrieves the album details from the 
Freedb.org website or the Amazon.com Web Services and 
automatically renames and tags the mp3 files according to the 
users requests.
The program can also read the embedded mp3 tags (ID3 tags) 
and rename the files according to the found tags and/or their 
filename.
Includes an advanced ID3 tag editor that supports 
soundtracks/releases with multiple artists.
It's also possible to write and remove album cover pictures from 
the ID3 tags.
There are several options available for manipulating the new 
filenames and their tags.
The Program is also capable of downloading track lengths to 
ensure the validity of your mp3 albums.
Smart MP3 Renamer supports both ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags.
