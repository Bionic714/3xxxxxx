thanks"
,Strick9,2006-02-21T03:31Z,"Nevermind i got it to work, it was because i had used the trial version before, had to use RegMon to eliminate some registry keys  :)

Any ideas?"
,snuskmumrik,2006-11-13T23:24Z,"This program will not work, because freedb.og does not have any websearch anymore.
So right now it's just junk.. But it WAS the best before."

However, it works like a charm when renaming from the tags.. 

I just downloaded the software and I had to remove all tags from a few albums. And since freedb or the Amazon-settings work, My only option was to use the tags in each file.. 

So I used the tags that I was going to remove as a reference to the new names for my files.. No problems at all! 

What I wanted to say was that its not useless just because freedb doesnt work.. you can still rename your files in a great way! 

Thanks for upload "
