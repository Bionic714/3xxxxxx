,Bubble,2005-06-25T21:43Z,"For all those people stuck on 99.9%, don't give up and delete all your data.  To extract a working image file use winrar to repair the unfinished rar segment (the one ending in .r00), then delete the original .r00 file and rename the fixed one.  Then extract as normal.  Worked for me."
