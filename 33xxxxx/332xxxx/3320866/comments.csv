,kanetsb,2005-04-24T13:09Z,"I'm not sure about this one - but if it's the same as the other 1.1 patch+crack by HOODLUM then it's not really cracked. ;) You know, hidden protection stuff and shit... Like not beeing able to increase the taxes in the game. :( I just use the cloned version and burn the second CD with alcos secu 5.x mode.
Anti-blaxx (that's a really NICE name... :> ) activates the protection stuff too so... don't use it."
,Cold_HawK-,2005-04-24T13:15Z,"Really, it worked to increase the taxxes tho. I haven't discovered what's wrong with this one yet. I really hope this one will work 100% :("
,Jeinhor,2005-04-24T22:21Z,"No, it does not. Try to start the campaign. It crashes when the conversation begins."
,Cold_HawK-,2005-04-24T23:44Z,"Multipalyer is quite messed too. Won't work to press some of the buttons sometimes and when you start the game, you get back to the main menu."
,kennethkkkk,2005-04-25T22:12Z,it's not working.. i have burned it to a cd and it's says that it's not a orginal cd! HELP ME!
,AnticZ,2005-04-26T04:31Z,The clone version works fine for me with antiblaxx. But i have not tried to apply this patch.
