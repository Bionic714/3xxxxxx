WTF?. I have also tried this with deamon tolls and other ppl here have the same problem i hope sum1 has a solution to this.....
It would be great"
,Lethal3737,2005-05-06T19:40Z,"First of all I have had multi Messages of people thanking me for this copied version of Toca so I cannot understand why you have a problem.

When you insert CD1 it will ask for Data 3 ""I think"" which means you need to insert CD2 into your CD Drive because CD2 is actaully the one that installs all the Data to play the game.

Hope this helps!!"
,fluffybal,2005-05-07T21:44Z,heyyyy thx it worked!!
,M_Ericsson,2005-06-13T06:03Z,"jo du stoppar i cd 1 sen står det insert dics bla bla då stoppar du i cd2 och sen börjar den installera sen när de e kalrt och den säger till om cd1 bara pula i den och sen cracka funkar hur bra som hälst inga problem alls

,benakenobi,2011-06-14T12:45Z,"so funny to look at this after Race Driver GRID
manual gearbox acts weird in this one, so differently from other games, now i guess i have to search for automatic option somewhere in order to not ruin sim-skills with it

anyway, works like a charm, no idea why somebody put a minus, i shall put plus"
,saddambea,2012-01-31T00:23Z,"when i try to install, i get this error: ""Error reading install configuration"" and it doesn't install :("
,tospeed1980,2012-03-28T18:37Z,"1. put disk 1 in and run autorun.exe
   and then change disk 2 in and click install button and install game.

2. if this not working try to use Win2000 & adminator rights
   in all install exe."
,GIjoe346,2012-06-13T03:07Z,error reading install configuration. Have tried every solution listed in the comments to get it to install even win2000 and adin rights but the installation still won't work. have to put a minus for this. sorry
,hit-meh,2012-08-04T21:05Z,"Hey everybody!!! After some time of waiting, I've tried to install the game, so I mount the disc 1. When I saw it's not working, I start  the installer on the disc 2, and it actually starts. But after the beginning it shows ""Error Reading Install Configuration"" and that pissed me off. Pls help me, I wanna play this game so badly. PLS"
