,brujade71,2007-02-25T19:50Z,"I obey you master too! I just did a search for ""mallorca"" to write some comments about a dodgy mix called the ""mallorca megamix"" which i downloaded yesterday, and found this gold instead. whoah, what are we going to do if the RIAA/MPAA take down TPB ?! Thanks Capomaniak, hope you are still around..."
,brujade71,2007-02-26T21:18Z,"What ashame some of the mp3s are gluggy. Some are extended or club mixes (e.g. Roses Are Red). But unlike other miscelaneous mp3 collections that I've downloaded, I think I'll listen to your series because its so so cheesy. I salute you cheese master"
