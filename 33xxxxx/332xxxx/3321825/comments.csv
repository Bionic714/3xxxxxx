,nv96jom,2005-04-26T12:35Z,"Nice är du tillbaka Zettie!!! Som jag saknat dig, har hittat lite filmer via en kinesisk sida men det går som det vore i sirap! Sugen på att byta lite filmer, har fått tag på ca 30st :)"
,T33,2005-04-26T19:44Z,Grejt!
,nv96jom,2005-04-26T21:10Z,ive added swordfish for those who missed it :) 1080p!!!
,W3ird_N3rd,2005-04-27T03:25Z,"Nice :-)

I'm still looking for The Matrix 1080i (I probably missed it a few months ago, only found dead links/torrents). It would be very nice if you could make a torrent :-)"
,W3ird_N3rd,2005-04-27T15:19Z,"The first movie, from 1999.

And I'm seeding :)"

Kan du länka till denna dära kinesiska sidan med hdtv material.
Du får också gärna lägga upp de filmer du själv har.
En lista på dom vore i alla fall kul, (så man ser vad man går miste om.)"
,W3ird_N3rd,2005-04-28T16:20Z,"Thanks, I already found The Matrix (almost 16% downloaded already). Found it on http://www.btchina.net/. There's a lot of other HDTV stuff there too.. After you found the search in Chinese ;)."
,DownwardSpiral,2005-06-04T04:33Z,"Excellent rip, and the movie was great. :) Thanks a ton; look forward to seeing more HD stuff!"
,Buba1981,2006-01-02T23:33Z,I have some jerky Playback on this... Shouldn't a 2800+ xp be enough? Which codecs are you using for it...?
,sthnreb,2006-06-07T19:32Z,I guess you need a  HD dvd with uplink with HDMI connection to play it in HD?
,leffa_f,2006-08-22T11:54Z,"Seed plz!
10 kb/s at the moment...

Thanx to those who do seed"
,xiIix,2006-11-13T07:32Z,Bad data from Tracker. Bummer!
,big_nanas,2007-04-17T15:22Z,"The second AVI file here completely ruins this otherwise excellent HD rip as it's in a lower resolution. 
Yes it's only a minute long, but it's sufficiently annoying as to make this torrent a little pointless. "
,phullscreen,2007-05-09T11:17Z,"I agree...

awesome torrent - great quality,
but pity about the short lowres intermission.

why?"
,Pippin,2007-08-09T15:41Z,"c'mon, seed"
