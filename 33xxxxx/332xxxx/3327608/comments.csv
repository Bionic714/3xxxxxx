This rip does not have these problem, and it's an xvid rip with AC3 5.1 sound. Image quality is crisp at preview. "
,JTMonkey,2005-06-17T17:45Z,"sorry, the sound isn't AC35.1 as I stated above. My bad. :) but still the image is the best of them all :)"

[T],480v,2008-10-06T11:38Z,"HOW and WHY is the movie from this torrent only 1h:31mn:51sec.? I downloaded it and it seems to be a complete film, but for some reason it's only  1h:31mn:51sec...The actual movie length is suppose to be 1h:36min. I went ahead and downloaded from a different torrent and it was 96min., the correct length. I'm baffled as to how this one is about 5min shorter."
,skfg64,2009-01-01T15:53Z,"Yes, the original release was 96 minutes. I think they reduced it when it was republished as 20th aniversary edition.

Please, anyone who has the FULL 25th Anniversary Movie Edition with all Extras and Bonuses, please make a torrent of it and share with the world"
,JJROCKER,2009-02-13T20:38Z,WORKS GREAT-- AUDIO AND VIDEO GOOD. THANKS
,AphexBall,2010-03-15T00:41Z,"Excellent, thanks Jule42!"
,KickassWashingMachine,2010-07-10T11:10Z,"@480v:nnThe shorter runtime here is because it\'s from a PAL DVD, i.e. 25 fps instead of the 23.976 fps you get in an NTSC DVD. Usually, the production companies choose to speed up the original film from 24 fps to 25 fps when converting to PAL because it\'s literally impossible to do a good-looking conversion otherwise, while the NTSC DVDs are first slowed down ever so slightly from the original 24 fps to 23.976 fps and then applied a telecining process where they use frame doubling to go from 23.976 fps to 29.96 fps which is the native NTSC frame rate.nnAnyway, that explains why 99% of the time, PAL DVDs will have a duration that is 95.96% the runtime of their NTSC counterparts. They\'re not shorter, they just run a little faster. You won\'t notice it until you do a side-by-side comparison (which is actually pretty funny, because then you start to notice that everyone\'s voice is pitched higher in the PAL release ;) )."
,KickassWashingMachine,2010-07-10T11:11Z,"Thanks by the way, I have never seen this before, looking forward to it :)"
,RaddekRaptor,2010-07-30T05:51Z,"Since this was originally PAL, has anyone tried viewing this rip on an NTSC television ?"
,RaddekRaptor,2010-07-31T00:21Z,"Update: Works on my xbox 360 but not my PS3. Shame. Great quality, tho. Thanks!"
,technosailor,2010-12-14T12:10Z,"Great torrent, great quality and subtitles included and the 'making of' was something I always wanted to see, thanks a lot!"
,maryl2310,2011-01-05T21:34Z,thanks!!!!
,dYhA85s,2011-03-07T02:46Z,"Sorry but the making of doc is of incredibly crap quality despite its large size - as soon as anything moves you see the ""interlaced"" lines all over the thing that moves - unwatchable.

I rather recommend http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5969778 which is just perfect!"
,azzastylzey,2011-05-31T07:20Z,please seed guys!
