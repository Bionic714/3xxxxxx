WARNING file seems to be broken at 00:17:38, and then again at about 44, 53 and 54 minutes--that's when I quit watching.

Tried it with players vlc, mplayer and xine with same results. Output from mplayer (at 17 min):
[mpeg4 @ 0x89bf470]header damaged  0.233 25457/25457  0%  0%  0.7% 0 0 55%
Error while decoding frame!

Some few seconds or minutes not playable after each error.

Thanks anyhow. Will keep seeding, maybe somebody knows a workaround for this?"
,LezDawson,2008-09-21T12:05Z,"As stated above, the film certainly does look brilliant.  But is this version really watchable?  I got so sick of constantly having to skip over corrupt bits, I gave up after halfway, and am now DLing the big seeded version.  From what I have already seen, I'm sure this movie is worth the effort.  I might convert it to avi and re-seed, once I have DL'd it."
[V],Kefissos,2008-09-25T01:05Z,The film is broken several of times...:-(
,LezDawson,2008-09-28T16:49Z,"Here's a clean rip, folks.  Taken straight from the full DVD version and converted to avi using Xilisoft DVD Ripper 5.

,JesusEatsBabies,2010-09-24T04:17Z,"wish i read these comments, movie is broken a whole bunch of times and you end up missing like 10 or 15 min of the movie skippin around past em. 

DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!"
,smotana,2012-01-07T21:43Z,"as far as I'm concerned, this is unwatchable, the glitches, skips (often of crucial scenes) and stops spoil the whole experience of the movie. you'd be better of finding another version!"
