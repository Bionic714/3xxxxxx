Mike Ness is the voice of Social Distortion.

Breaking away from Social Distortion in 1999, Mike recorded this solo album to explore different styles of music that mean something to him. In Social D, he stuck mostly to punk rock, with the exception of 1992â€™s fantastic  Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell, which had a very heavy country/honky tonk influence.  Cheating at Solitaire picks up from this point and moves further away from the punk rock and closer to the country. Along the way, the album picks up some more influences, including a bit of blues and some greasy rockabilly.

This abum is a must have in my opinion. But what do i know. Im a Social D junkie! :)
