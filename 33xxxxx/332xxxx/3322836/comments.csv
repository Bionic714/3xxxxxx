,Pepsimal,2005-05-02T12:23Z,"What is this? The music cd isn't live, and the singer not female (I hope not) - The music on the CD is 
""La sonrisa de Júlia - Caminos diferentes"". I haven't downloaded  the DVD yet, but some sort of error must have occured. The music on the CD is okey, but it isn't what I have expected.  :-) / Have a nice day"

,aissmehn,2005-06-10T21:12Z,"[REQUEST] (since I found no ""requests"" section on the site, I'm posting this one as a stardard comment)

I have the CD from this release, but would really like to have the full Audio track from the DVD -- If I got it right, there are about 8 songs which we're not included in the CD version. Is there any chance that one of the good souls who've downloaded the full DVD image could rip the audio and post it? If you need advise (or the tools) required to do it, I'd be more than happy to give you a hand...

thanks"
