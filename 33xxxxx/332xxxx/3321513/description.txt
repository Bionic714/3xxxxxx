I only received 'Nos' today and haven't actually listened to it properly!

Virginia Rodrigues - 'Sol Negro' is also uploaded

Virginia Rodrigues Sol Negro- Fantastic !!
If you dont listen to it all then at least check out
'Negrume da Noite' which is actually track 1 on the album... superb 

Still awaiting the 3rd album, will post when arrives.... Enjoy!

Album encoded by Nero, VBR top quality.

If you like it buy the disc and support the artist, I got mine here quite cheap..
