NICE"
,chawn,2005-04-27T09:03Z,"hehe, sry but I told u to be patient (in swe though), I've caugth a terrible cold and accidently fell asleep yesterday (like around 1800 :S) before I had set my comp to seeding again... "
,chawn,2005-04-27T09:09Z,"I am thinking about stopping it entirely when I reach 99%, when I get such lousy votes :p"
,tiitr,2005-04-27T09:56Z,"Well that would be a nice surprise :P
arrr, I shouldn't complain, at least there are mac programs and games available."
,chawn,2005-04-27T11:17Z,"indeed, and about... Now... would be a great time to throw my little surpise, but nah, I am not that nasty :p hopefully I can start seeding something new soon"
,Stormreaver,2005-04-27T18:01Z,"Realy nice to put this torrent up man, we are all very greatful. Nice to see more mac torrents comming : )"
,Simonson,2005-04-27T18:30Z,"We'll take over seeding from here! So feel free to find something new for us to go waiting for! ;)

Thanks, by the way!"
,syvrin,2005-05-03T14:23Z,"Alright DL complete except now there is one small problem.  How do you Toast the disc image?  Toast says that it is 4.8 gb, which is too large for a standard DVD.  Also, how do you get the crack to work?  Since I can't toast the disc and can't install without the disc, how do you get this thing going??"
,chawn,2005-05-04T19:38Z,"hm, It was a loong time ago I used this file myself but I never think I actually burned it. I just mounted it with toast and installed it :S one thing that u migth want to do is ""locking"" the file before mounting it or it might not be recognized as a ROM. "
,caldaean,2005-05-08T20:11Z,"Gah, skrivit en lång bra kommentar, så kommer den inte med. :-(

Anyways, jag vet itne vad det är som är fel, men detta funkar itne på min iBook som kör Tiger. Provat alla möjliga patchvarianterna som följde med, och även utan. Spelet totalkrashar såfort man väljer new game. Antingen så beror det på en bugg i spelet, eller inkompabilitet med något i Tiger är min gissning. Vet någon en lösning så vill jag veta genast, eftersom jag inte svingat en lightsaber sedan Jedi Knight. :-) "
,chawn,2005-05-08T22:46Z,"jag har oxå problemet med inlägg som inte kommer med X/ skriver aldrig inlägg längre än ngra rader numera :( jobbit när man skrive lååånga instruktioner som bara försvinner :'(

har tyvär ingen lösning på ditt problem ;)"
,MK_Ultra,2005-05-11T19:05Z,"I think I'm mounting everything correctly, but when I try to start the game it goes to a black screen, the cursor changes, and then it immediately quits back to the desktop. Anybody have any idea why this is happening? I'm running on a dual 1 ghz G4, 2GB of ram, and a Geforce ti 4600, which seems like it should be plenty fast enough. "
,Keess,2005-05-21T09:54Z,"I'm stuck at 99%....
What is this?"
,odelay86,2005-07-14T02:24Z,"I've finally d/led this thing but am having problems.  I was hoping someone could explain in simple terms what to do.  Right now all I have is a .dmg file.  When I first double-clicked it, it mounted the game folder, but then said to insert the disc when i opened the app.  I tried putting it in toast and mounting the .dmg (locked from the get info part as mentioned before) but it just says it isn't recognized.  Once again could someone give me some basic, much-needed help.  It would be very appreciated.  Thanks!"
,**Billa**,2005-07-20T04:06Z,I have the same prob as everyone else. Have a Ibook G4.  Anybody solved it? please let me know.
,negopreto,2006-01-07T16:19Z,"Oh, for God's sake! Somebody help us, poor Mac users! Did anybody made this game run? I have the  same problems as our friend MK Ultra: ""I think I'm mounting everything correctly, but when I try to start the game it goes to a black screen, the cursor changes, and then it immediately quits back to the desktop. Anybody have any idea why this is happening? I'm running on a dual 1 ghz G4, 2GB of ram, and a Geforce ti 4600, which seems like it should be plenty fast enough."" 
Help! Help! Help! 
Hey! Downloaders!
I don't think that's a good idea to continue the donwload if nobody tells how to make it work."
,MACarron,2006-03-19T11:19Z,"Copy the ""Knights Of The Old Republic"" folder to your HD. Unzip the ""KOTORMac103a.zip"" and replace the file ""Knights Of The Old Republic"" in the folder you have copied before. Mount the ""SW-KOTOR 1.03 NoCD Cracked.dmg"" and replace (again) the file ""Knights Of The Old Republic"". That works for me."
,mattyg333,2006-05-07T17:06Z,"Please seed, I'm at 50% and its not moving. I'll return the favor 3 fold"
,mattyg333,2006-05-11T21:34Z,"PLEASE SEED!!

,Jtodarizzo,2008-01-10T21:38Z,"Could someone with full file please seed ive been left dangling at 78% for months
Cheers
"
,matb52,2008-03-25T04:34Z,"It's been awhile and many people still want's it so if anyone can seed it, would be fantastick "
,phanax,2008-04-02T05:44Z,"The above link actually gets you a few seeders. It's not many and it's scattered over a few different web-pages. Right now at 5.42 in the morning I'm getting 9 kb /s with bittorrent on my macbook pro (midsummer 2007 specs)

I can't seed anything with bittorrent but if I could I probably would have done so once I got it working (if I get it working). So I advise people wanting this to go check that above link. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. Sure hope it works"
,vibeke71,2008-05-21T15:32Z,"This game doesnt work properly on Intel Macs btw (sometime after Taris - see official Kotor mac forums). If you want it to run properly on your Intel Mac then you need to download a Universal binary patch to make it run. Unfortunately you'll need to ""Insert a disk"" to make the patch run and this download isnt a ""disk"".

Any thoughts on this?"
,VileCore,2008-06-13T15:29Z,This is in the wrong section.
,HeKpoMaHcep,2008-07-07T20:37Z,SEED PLEASE!!!!!!
,1nd13k1d,2008-11-06T20:10Z,Please seed! I am at 80.32% and no one seeding has more than that at this point. 
,troubadourix,2009-01-05T21:16Z,"for NOCD crack and UB update go to :

thepiratebay.org/torrent/4625295/KotorNoCDcrack__amp__updates.zip"
,djoshua,2010-01-29T12:14Z,the game still crashes after the 1.0.3d update and no cd patch.....
