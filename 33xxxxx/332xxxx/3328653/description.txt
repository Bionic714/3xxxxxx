<i><b>From SpaceCast.com:</b>What if humans didn't abuse the earth and its resources? How different would the world be? Take a fantastic leap of the imagination and explore the world through three parallel universes - Alphaverse (what our world could end up being), Betaverse (our world today), and Gammaverse (what our world could have been).
Charlie Jade is a rogue detective in Alphaverse who, while on the hunt for the killer of a missing woman, gets caught in an explosion from a covert desert operation, propelling him into a stange parallel universe (Betaverse). As he searches for the truth about the explosion, he is drawn into a conflict that not only involves his home universe and the one he now inhabits, but another pristine pacificist universe (Gammaverse) with unsuspected terror at its heart.
"Charlie Jade is utterly unlike anything else on television. From its extraordinary sci-fi noir visual style to the deep sense of mystery and suspense, its compelling and all-too-human characters take us on a unique, exotic and mind-bending adventure," says Diane Boehme, Executive in Charge of Production and Senior Director, Independent Production for CHUM Television. "CHUM is proud to be able to bring this provocative and intelligent adult drama to those viewers who are hungering for something different."</i>
