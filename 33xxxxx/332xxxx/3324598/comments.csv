,reezeh,2005-05-02T22:23Z,Awesome episode... is there a bug with my comment page? - it didn't post last comment - unless it is very laggy! :D
,speakeasy,2005-05-02T23:26Z,"You're a complete star!  I've only just noticed that you're posting these uncompresed versions.
Thank you so much."
,reezeh,2005-05-03T02:13Z,"Gotta agree there, so far the iso's have been pretty well faultless... a lot better than the reception I get for BBC - that's why I am forced to get them like this! As I said, best Dr Who episode I think I have ever seen... and living in the UK I can say I have seen a lot of them over the years!"
,pookybear_,2005-05-03T22:33Z,These Uncompressed files are awesome!!! I'm never around to see these on tv and these are better quality then if I could! Thanks for the great upload!
,Growltiger,2005-05-15T22:13Z,"I really must thank you... living in the states (and in the desert at that!) this is the only way I can get these until they are released by the BBC.   :)  Then I'll buy them just for fairness sake!

This is the first time I've downloaded this huge format (usually I jst download .avi or .mpeg) and I'm having trouble viewing it.   Are their good instructions for putting them to DVD somewhere?   I used VSO's CopytoDVD and I get the menu and such, but I can't yet watch it.

Any help appreciated... and thanks!"
,reezeh,2005-05-16T01:28Z,"You need something like Nero to burn the iso image to dvd...
Alternatively, you can watch them on your pc: extract the iso to another directory using something like Winrar or any iso handling tool (iso is just an image file, archived like a .zip), then use your pc's dvd playing software to play the individual files within.
I hope that helps."
,Growltiger,2005-05-16T07:57Z,":)   Got it, burned it, watched it, loved it.

It turns out that for some reason the first time I extracted the files (I use winrar) the big huge files didn't extract, just the small ones.    This left me with a menu that popped up, but nothing else.    I extracted again and everything turned out great.

Thanks again, for the files, and the help."
