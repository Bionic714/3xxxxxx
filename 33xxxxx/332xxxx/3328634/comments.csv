It absolutely must be played on an N64!


This is a f'&""%# classic!"

,Raw_Rodrigo,2008-09-29T06:15Z,"This might just be the stupidest question ever asked on Piratebay, but do you need a emulator to play this? Or can you just play it simply on a PC?..."
,Jedwilliams,2009-04-05T08:00Z,"Dowloaded nicely, but how do you play it?"
,mokkan13,2010-03-31T09:22Z,"http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/n64/project64.html

It runs fine, and use that to emulate the .n64 file

But is there a way to change the controls? :/

incredibly hard to aim with such poor control of the cross hair.

note: z is shoot."
