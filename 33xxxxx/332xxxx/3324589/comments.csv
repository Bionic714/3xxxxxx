,thepom,2006-04-16T23:44Z,"Är det fler än jag som har problem med att avsnitten är väldigt mörka? Tycker att det är så för mig med alla serier jag tar hem.

Har inte tänkt på det förrän jag såg skillnaden mellan avsnitt 7 och 8 i detta paket.

Varför är det så stor skillnad och finns det något man kan göra?"
