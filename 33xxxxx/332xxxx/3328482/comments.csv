,redeyeglass,2008-03-01T03:22Z,"any suggestions on how, if possible, to get this to open on a mac? "
,monkiesatemybaby,2008-03-10T08:33Z,change the file extension  on the annotations file from .cbz to .rar and you can then open the html files in your browser.
,riceaholic,2008-04-13T08:30Z,"This is total bullshit.  Only contains the last part and they're all jpgs, not cbz/cbr.  Complete waste of time."
,DokLazlo,2008-05-07T14:57Z,Can anyone tell me how to convert my bunch of jpegs (for a comic book) into one of those nice little cbr files? Visited the CD Display site to see if there was an additional application to buy but my email bounce back via daemon failure. I have some Alan Moorse Swamp Thing I am trying to organize so this advice would be most helpful. Thanks!
,HH000,2008-07-20T00:44Z,Pages are cropped at the bottom. 
,bobo236,2008-07-24T01:24Z,Rename 00 from .cbr to .rar then it will open with the html notes for each issue.

,ConnSolo,2008-12-29T06:09Z,"Why is the first half .cbr (Which is great) and the rest .jpegs? Fuckin' bullshit mate...who wants to open them one by one? I know it's free, and yes I know I'm bitching, but jesus pick which format and stick to it, cbz(ing) comics is stupid and messy. However, thank you for your upload, blahdy blahdy blah..."
,sarin666,2009-01-01T05:36Z,The first part of the comic is missing pages. If you look at the bottom left goes from page 5 to page 15.
