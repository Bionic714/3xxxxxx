This is a trojanfree repost of olrusty1's post:

The original zipped .exe has carefully been extracted to a plain .avi - there is no reason to post a movie as an self-extracting archive unless you are evil and want to spread viruses and trojans.

Olrusty1 isn't just good at spreading trojans, it is also good at making irrelevant file descriptions. This clip doesn't contain much of the buzzwords mentioned in the filename - see comments below.
