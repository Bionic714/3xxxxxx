   R.C. Cars is an arcade racer where the player drives an R/C car over
   off-road levels that closely reproduce the real world. Within the race
   the player comes across people, animals, cars and a variety of real-life
   obstacles. The player drives his small radio-controlled car in an
   environment where daily life is in its full swing. He needs to overtake
   his opponents and finish first.
