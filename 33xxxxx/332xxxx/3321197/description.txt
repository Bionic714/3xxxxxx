The greatest musical ever made. Liza Minelli never did anything as good ever again. 
Set in Germany between the wars. Flaky Showgirl (Liza Minelli) meets new-in-town english tutor (Michael York). 
Lots of good music and shownumbers (if you like that kind of stuff). 
All during a time where nazism is slowly crawling out from under the rocks.
Swedish subtitles (not optional I'm afraid)
