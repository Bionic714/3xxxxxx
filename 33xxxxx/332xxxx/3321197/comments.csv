Bye the way - a number of people have downloaded this film. Aren't there any comments? Did you like the film? Was the quality OK? The compression may have been a mouthful for older computers - did it work well for you?"
,fbuddy,2006-02-26T08:13Z,"tack för denna, det ser ut som den blir svår att få ner nuförtiden dock."
,Hamurabi,2006-11-28T21:03Z,"I certainly like this movie although I have seen it many times before.

I am downloading it now to see it again. When I have it I will assist in the seeding indefinitely (until I have to cange computer or such).

This kind of thing is really necesary with old stuff. You can't expect that everybody will down load a ten year old movie exactly when you seed it. It works with the latest episode of simpsons but not when you want to share classics."
,Hamurabi,2006-12-08T20:08Z,"I'm still waiting to get all of it which just illustrates my point. Old stuff has to be seeded a loooong time.

I'm guessing I'll give up in a week or so, but this site still lists 1 distributor so I'm waiting a little longer."
,Hamurabi,2007-01-08T20:03Z,"It turns out that my software put this torrent on pause in stead of activating it upon restart so I haven't seeded for a little time now. Sorry about that. If someone has tried recently and not succeded in getting the whole shaboom then do try again now.

Hurry though I will only seed for a few years. My computer might burn up..."
,Hamurabi,2007-01-08T20:10Z,"The point I am making here is: A classic is something that you will likely keep anyway, why not seed indefinately?

Otherwise classics will be exceedingly hard to get. Of course, the idea of putting everything into rar files counteracts this quite a lot. I personally think that the rar files are a bad idea in general.

Video formats are already compressed so nothing is to be gained there. Very big files are not good because one error destroys the lot but just dividing very big video files inte several smaller files seems a sufficient solution. These won't be 14 Mb but perhaps 600 instead, but with todays bandwidths that is entirely acceptable."
,fiyero,2008-01-13T20:50Z,i couldnt open this when i got it.
,framtiden3,2008-02-02T16:28Z,Filmen går ej att köra på någon typ av DVD - endast på Datan.
