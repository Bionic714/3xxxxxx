Another sucky music video... 

May be The Suckiest Video of All Time if you consider this video basically ruined the career of Billy Squier. His fan base disintegrated after this was shown on the video channels. According to Miss Squier the video "wreaked havoc on my career".

Justice, I say. 

Review by William S. Repsher of leisuresuit.net

With this album, Billy Squier ruled the rock roost with hit after hit: The Stroke, In the Dark and Lonely Is the Night; He could do no wrong in 1981. This album was a how-to guide on becoming a superstar, and damn few artists could write it. I wanted to hate Don't Say No, and when friends first played it, I did as much. But after a few listens, I realized that this guy simply had a great pop sense. Album tracks like Too Daze Gone, I Need You and Nobody Knows made this a solid effort and showed he could be more than a flash in a pan.

So why, then, was he? This can be traced to a video he did for his 1984 single Rock Me Tonight. Not a bad song at all--but the video was Billy prancing around an apartment in a Flashdance-style ripped sweatshirt and tights. The way he danced . . . oh, he looked terrible. All his die-heard fans I knew said: "Man, doesn't Billy look like a fag in the video for 'Rock Me Tonight"  It put his career on a lower trajectory, and signaled a weird change in rock. New wave guys could come off like "fags" -it was expected. But a rock star? No way, man! If you did so, you had to over-compensate with pseudo-macho blathering to offset any hint of androgyny, a la Motley Crue and Poison. Billy Squier was better than that, but his rock-and-roll dice were rolled, and they came up snake eyes.
