"Norman McLaren was a cinematic virtuoso and perhaps the medium's greatest innovator. To create his delightful and dazzling animation, he employed an amazing array of techniques, including painting directly on film and his own invention, "pixilation" - a wildly surreal form of filming actors in stop motion. For several short films, he even drew the soundtrack - an unbelievably complex process. But while creativity, humor and technical virtuosity are the hallmarks of his work, it was McLaren's compassionate intelligence and sense of humanity that make these charming films enduring masterpieces."
