,croak,2005-04-22T16:38Z,What is this for files please tell oss.: VIDEO_TS.mpv  VTS_O1_1.wpa  VTS_01_1.mpv
,freesat,2005-04-22T20:12Z,mpv files are from some program to add subtitles. Like DVD lab pro or something. You dont need to download this. Or You can DL only these MPV and AC3 files and  manualy add you subs :)
,wonderr7,2005-04-22T22:48Z,"this release is a ""ready2edit"" version thats why its so big,just load it in dvdlab and there u go."
,Mindblower,2005-04-26T01:51Z,"hi bliktud.
this may be a server placed in a scandihoovian country, but it surely is open to anyone. and i am sure that u can even read most of the dutch subs, without great dificult, as many words are quite like your own native tongue or a mix of german, english, danish..so no need to nag about it.
it would be more relevant to question about the muslim txtÂ´s, in my opinion they are much harder to read."
