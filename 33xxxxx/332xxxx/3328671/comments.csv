I am new to this sight, it looks very nice and useful.

But I have a problem, I have downloaded this torrent, NOW what do I do with it? Windows does not recognise the file types."
,twebbas,2005-05-13T12:59Z,"ok. u need a program like bitlord to download the files here on pirate bay.. otherwise windows wont recognize them..

so download for instance bitlord 1.1 (latest version) from this site or search on google or something. then u can open the files directly when downloading them (.torrent). a gui will open and the files will start downloading. as simple as that. =)

p.s sometimes it takes a few minutes or even 10 for the download to start. ;)"
,shinobiung,2005-05-14T01:05Z,"Thankyou for your response, swedish people seem much nicer than  English or Americans. :p

Is Bitlord 1.1 better? I have the Bitlord 0.56"
,Ragbunny,2005-05-30T15:08Z,"Guess latest versions are better, though I dont use bitlord=P check their forums if u are uncertain.."
