,ivan.88,2008-11-16T23:13Z,"The 9th symphony is very slow unfortunately. The choir in the 4th movement is far too staccato, so you don't have time to enjoy the beautiful harmonics. The baritone soloist uses too much vibrato in his parts. Just saying, if you're only after the 9th, do not download this version. Haven't listen to the other symphonies yet"
,doradhorror,2010-01-08T10:21Z,"Who's the fucking composer and what orchestra? 

I'm sick of fucking idiots posting shit with no description."
,LittleDicksHaveBigMouths,2010-01-15T20:12Z,"Well doradhorror, if you cannot work out who the composer is, I suggest that you ask one of the grownups in your house to help you."
,anomic1,2010-02-27T20:11Z,"I have been having a problem with these files, and some other FLAC files, where the music will skip about 1-3 minutes at the end of each track. Is it a problem with the files themselves? I'm playing files in VLC and have played other FLAC files without the skipping problem."
,mtarroyo,2010-03-04T14:56Z,"This is the CD-Rip from the box set Beethoven Symphonies 1-9 performed by The London Classical Players/Sir Roger Norrington (5 CDs).

,ashmatash,2010-07-09T06:00Z,"A good recording of a very stale performance. The tempo of the 5th Symphony seemed rushed and rather static. There was very little play in with the dynamics, which is a shame. For me, that gives the piece so much feeling to other performance I\'ve listened to. The 9th Symphony\'s \""Ode to Joy\"" just seemed spiritless. I usually get goosebumps when I hear that one, but this version just seemed anticlimactic. I guess I\'m just going to have to keep looking for a performance that better suits my tastes. This one needs a little more salt."
,ashmatash,2010-07-09T06:02Z,A good recording of a very stale performance. nThere are much better recordings available.
,ashmatash,2010-07-09T06:03Z,Bland...stale performancen
