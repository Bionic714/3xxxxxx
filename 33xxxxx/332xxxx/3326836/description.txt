In China They Eat Dogs. The last wish of the dying &quot;Monk&quot;

Ludvig. But the latter is currently in a Swedish prison 
cell. Peter and Martin - the two chefs - want to get him
out and soon father and son meet for the first time in
their lives. They get on from the word go, but now dad
needs a liver transplant and Ludvig and Harald set about
raising the wherewithal. Everything goes wrong when they
try to rob a bank, though they meet Mille, who puts them
onto a new trail, and Peter and Martin also make a
contribution. However, soon they have the cops and the
