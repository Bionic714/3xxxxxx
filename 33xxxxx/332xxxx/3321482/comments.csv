,Daedolon,2005-04-26T21:18Z,Är det bara musik från spelet i videon? Ett av spåren låter som musiken från trailern till LOTR - The Two Towers...
,Simkin_dfsj,2005-04-27T02:01Z,"cool video i think!
i NEED to know though what music has been used, at 19min30secs runtime thres a song playing i KNOW i know, but i just cant remember where its from. so pls tell me!!"
,Kork_h,2005-04-27T13:33Z,"um, and the songs was mostly from Wow yeh, OST ^^

to give it that wow feeling (since i mostly listen to mp3s when playing ^^)"
,Kork_h,2005-04-27T13:34Z,"Well, The movie with me (ninja) and the warrior was just for fun, to showoff that potion/food we used :P

Anyways, the song at min 19 is requiem for/of a dream
And is not a LOTR trailer movie ;P its from the movie with the same name as the song, But it was used as theme in a Fake trailer of The Hobbit!

And at last, well yeh the raid didnt go so well :P hehe but i guess those lvl 500+ city epic people isnt supposed to go down so fast ;P. 

I think that was all?"
