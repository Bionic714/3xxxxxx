DTS is bloated garbage.

Dolby 5.1 reporduces everything that DTS does and takes up less than half the space.

Also worth noting is that DTS won't play on your TV, only through a home stereo system with a DTS decoder.

DTS is thus useless to me as I am greeted with silence."
,Janiqq,2005-04-30T17:39Z,"yeah I have the same... no sounds with DTS movies.... DD 5.1 is best version ... works on everyone systems and differend between DTS and DD 5.1 is minimal...... it's just same.....
good work ;)"

,tomahawk_dts,2005-07-19T10:36Z,"The film is rubbish, the acting is bad, and there is no plot whatsoever, but go and buy this disc now. This is the best soundtrack ever produced, totally OTT and with enough low end to change the air pressure in you room - for that real 'hairs standing up on the back of the neck' experience.

We want that dts track!!!"
,tomahawk_dts,2005-07-19T10:38Z,"To hear this track in 5.1 is great, but switch to 6.1 DTS-ES Discrete and it becomes the best made-for-DVD soundtrack ever!  From : http://www.dvdtherapy.com/reviews/haunting.php"
