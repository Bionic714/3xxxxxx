,Gordys,2006-10-23T21:27Z,seed plz. i'm stuck at 99.99%
,Bolaz,2007-05-09T11:29Z,"Yeah! I was sure, that game this old could not be found anywhere. THANKS! i will seed, and for long."
,vulcan2,2007-06-22T17:22Z,"thanks a lot.. one of the best classic games ever :)
bitte danke"
,pod3210,2007-06-23T02:46Z,"downloaded it today, and when i tried to instal it the instal wizard did pop up but says game folder not found so i hit ok and the wizard continues with instal but after i accept terms it sayd it can't find a folder to install it in so when i just pick one it says that it cannot find pharaoh.exe in a folder so does this mean that i need to first dl pharaoh first or what ?"
,purpILLhOaze,2007-06-29T00:03Z,"pod3210: hi u have to make a seperate directory for Pharaoh - example suggestion: c:\games\pharaoh - but put it wherever you want, i suggest you name it ""pharaoh"" though. u can just unrar the files in that directory, and after that, u can just run the ""regsetup.exe"" prog. this should conclude the installation, now you can run the game with pharaoh.exe - and make a shortcut in your games start menu folder. if you have any problems after this, i cant help you, and have no responsibility for these problems, sorry...."
,AtavoSBrasil,2007-07-26T17:00Z,"So, this is a RIP!? What's included?? It's Full with the movies, audio, something is not in the pack?

Could you gives us those information please.
Thanks!"
,purpILLhOaze,2007-07-27T13:00Z,"AtavoSBrasil, yeah the original pharoh part is a rip - and then, cleopatra expansion installed over that. However I don't think there's anything missing, basically. IF something is,  it's just a couple of useless short movies. This is a rather old game (by todays standards) - if any movies are missing, they were not very impressive and didn't add much to the game...
I don't remember exactly but I think it said nothings missing."
,babyapa,2007-09-29T10:51Z,seed plzzzz
,Cpl.Volsky,2007-10-21T09:01Z,Thanx:) This is a really good game!!! Thnx purpILLhOaze
,p4nz3r,2007-12-02T16:02Z,thanks purpILLhOaze :) seed plz
,plelertus,2007-12-22T16:06Z,"Thanks purpILLhoaze!

But where are the sounds??? The wav folder is EMPTY. :( Under the audio folder, there's ambient, music and voice, which are all ok... but the wav folder is empty! I remembre a lot more sounds way back when i first played it... :( (like the temple gongs, crowd cheers etc.)"
,purpILLhOaze,2007-12-25T21:18Z,"^ ^ yeah you're probably correct there. the reason is simple - this package contains a ripped original pharaoh, and a full cleopatra expansion (after it has been installed). i was not sure what, if anything, was missing from the original version. now we've cleared that up it seems. i cant help w/the missing sounds tho, sorry."
,purpILLhOaze,2007-12-25T21:20Z,"ps. since the game worked very easily by just installing the folder wherever u want, i thought this package was much easier and cooler than another posted torrent - actually, 2 other torrents - with pharaoh and cleopatra posted as separate full ISO's  that made the full download MUCH bigger.

""sorry"" if u're offended by my attempt to help/do something cool. (of course, noT ;)"
,purpILLhOaze,2007-12-25T21:23Z,"on that note, have a merry xmas and a happy new pirate yARR , lmao !"
,purger666,2008-03-31T17:46Z,when i start the pharaoh.exe it asks me to insert my cleopatra cd.....?
,mikesoft,2008-04-07T08:13Z,LOL i had the exact same file from the year 2004 or something.. downloaded from kazaa or another p2p software... and went to download this torrent and it started seeding without even downloading.. so it's the same file =D A VEERY very nice game... please download and enjoy!
,mikesoft,2008-04-07T08:14Z,"also remember, after extracting, RUN the setup.bat file to decompress all the audio files..!"
,CommunistSquirrel,2008-05-09T02:59Z,such a great game
,insomniaxx,2008-06-26T15:11Z,"Thanks!
I'm downloading at 400 kb/s it's amazing!!!"
,chicucogarcia,2008-06-28T02:08Z,how do u delete stuff!!!>.. please tell me im begging!!!!... and purpILLHOaze great torrent..keep up the good work
,mythicpoet,2008-07-16T02:36Z,"wow this downloaded sooo fast, am seeding, but I wanted to note that the .wavs are there, you just need to run the setup file and it uncompresses them all into their folder :-D"
,meowers,2008-07-26T09:13Z,"590 kb/s! works, no problems! used to play this game back in the day, thank you ^_^"
,purpILLhOaze,2008-07-26T14:55Z,lol if i haven't said so already i was just a little distracted when it comes to the sounds thing---- hadn't used this thing in a looong while really. so that was a mistake hehe
,purpILLhOaze,2008-07-26T15:00Z,"oh and mikesoft that is patently wrong, i ""spliced"" the pharaoh rip with a cleopatra expansion i downloaded myself. if its the same file, you have gotten it from somewhere else but still created by me... i can spread shit too u know, this is the i-net."
,qutiedengullige,2008-08-03T20:27Z,Yay after losing my original cd... iam fineally going to be able to play this ^^ got the Farao urge a couple of days ago and couldnt ind the damned cd.. cant wait 20more sec before it finishes xD the average speed was like 800kb/sec and iam loving it

,purpILLhOaze,2010-01-28T18:37Z,"Penenita1, Where did u find a trojan? i'd appreciate it if u told me about this, if u are correct it was NOT on purpose that i guarantee. but u may have got a false positive as well...."
,fakester1,2010-02-13T01:08Z,"i thank you for this great torrent. it works perfect on my vista home premium 32bit no crashes, nothing. nod32 smart security with latest updates tells me the file is clean also."
,Naaram,2010-06-09T15:30Z,"Thank you a lot for this torrent...I buy Pharaoh ten years ago, and I always wanted to have the expansion, but I never found it here in Spain!

Thank you!"
,_Zotov_,2010-07-06T01:34Z,"Here's my quick guide to complete installation for this awesome game from this awesome pack:

1. Extract in ANY directory - this will be your game directory.
2. Run setup.bat - this will unpack sounds in appropriate place.
3. Run setupreg.exe - not sure what exactly it does, probably writing keys to registry of something."
,Okox,2010-07-16T23:59Z,"Muy bueno, gracias"
,Strypsex,2010-07-24T16:15Z,"There is actually a keylogger in the trainer.exe but my antivirus found it.

So delete the trainer atleast. And ""purpILLhOaze"" dont be a fucking ginger cunt and add keyloggers to your torrents when you say: ""I personally guarantee it is virii and ad/spyware free, I have never ever supported that kind of crap activity."""
,purpILLhOaze,2010-12-25T22:24Z,"Strypsex, it must be a false positive. 

Many anti-virus makes especially cracks, trainers and many keygens to be viruses without it being correct. So no, you're most likely wrong."
