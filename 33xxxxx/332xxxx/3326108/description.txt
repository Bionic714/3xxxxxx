Pharaoh and Cleopatra expansion
- - - - - - - - 

Nice, near-classic (some would say it really is classic) strategy game with the theme of ancient Egypt. Though the graphics might seem outdated at times, the gameplay (reminiscent of Cesar games/SimCity-esque building of cities combined with battle strategy type of games) makes up for it.

This game w/ expansion has recently been on tpb, but then as two separate torrents. I thought this format was more handy - both packages in one RARed EXE file.

I personally guarantee it is virii and ad/spyware free, I have never ever supported that kind of crap activity. Enjoy.
