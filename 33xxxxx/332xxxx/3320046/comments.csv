,I8aBaby,2005-04-22T09:31Z,"Hey dude, could you please send out the movies separately. i already have the two first mentioned.
The Dark Crystal is a great movie, but I'm not such a big fan of the Never Ending Story...
Haven't seen the Secret of NIMH, but now I'm corious.
Cheers"
,Olphus,2005-04-22T09:54Z,"Secret of NIMH, yeah...please?"
,tokije,2005-04-22T09:56Z,"ah, like the idea though. cheers."
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-22T09:57Z,"I can't do that.  It would open an extradiminsonal tear in the fabric of reality that would destroy absolutely EVERYTHING we know as the universe today.

But what you can do, is click on DETAILS, then RIGHT CLICK on the movies that you DO NOT WANT to download, and choose DOWNLOAD NEVER.  This works in Bittornado, ABC, and a few others.

Give it a try.  Let me know if it works for you."
,Mr_Modern,2005-04-22T10:43Z,"hell yeah I dimly remember these flicks as abso-fucking-bloody-lutely great!! good torrent dude these are perfect, and yes I am gonna watch them while stoned/drugged out of my mind..cheers dude!"
,occasus,2005-04-22T10:44Z,great initiative!
,BlackFlag79,2005-04-22T11:21Z,"Thanks sickboy88, I appreciate all of the rips you do... I downloaded a few movies recently and noticed most of them have ""sickboy88"" on the end :)

Is there any chance you have Flight of the Navigator?  I haven't seen that since I was a little kid and it's really hard to find."
,BlackFlag79,2005-04-22T11:29Z,"Guess I should've searched first... didn't even know it was out on DVD.  Well, thanks again for the rips."
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-22T11:31Z,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091059/

That one?  With the little robot, I remember that. hahah, OMG.  I saw it at the movies as well.

I've been trying to think of the name of it for weeks now.  Thanks!

Also, what is the movie with River Phoenix in it, where they build a spaceship, and go into outer space, and it has the really fake looking aliens in it?

Oh it's EXPLORERS http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089114/

Remember that one?! hahah

I'll do both movies and up them together at the start of next week.  I want them both anyway."
,BlackFlag79,2005-04-23T00:14Z,"lol, I wouldn't mind watching that Explorers movie.

Flight of the Navigator is upped here on Pirate Bay already, I'm at about 72% on it.  But maybe you want your own rip :)"
,Leppoisa,2005-05-05T06:30Z,SEEDERS PLEASE
,Leppoisa,2005-05-05T10:44Z,thanks :) amazing movies..
,disobedient,2005-05-09T06:53Z,"Sickboy, you rock.  Hard.

Keep the 80s coming... if you've got Coming to America that'd be fantastic."
[T],sickboy88,2005-05-18T06:16Z,"Going to be uploading ""The Golden Child"" soon.  It has the best demon I've ever seen in a movie."
,Mamooshka,2005-07-10T03:47Z,"ahh the secret of nimh, best animated film ever in my humble opinion, too bad don bluth never reached the same excellence again. any chance of a dvdr release of nimh? great selection of 80s nostalgia sickboy88!"
,Highway61,2005-07-19T15:54Z,"wow, i  can't believe this is the only place ive ever found a nimh torrent, and its such a great movie, someone should put ""an american tail"" onto a torrent as well, its not as much a mindfuck as weird (russian jewish mice flee ther homeland to america cos theres no cats apparantly)"
,WuKillaBee,2005-08-10T06:32Z,labyrinth could have been added too.
,Shippy,2005-08-11T13:21Z,"SEED plz
stuck at 99.9%   :-("
,robowarriorx,2006-01-20T06:27Z,"Where is Garbage Pail Kids the Movie? Talk about a serious mindfuck. I mean no offense, but these aren't that bad at all. There are far worse ones out there, like GBC, the animated Lord of the Rings Fellowship, and a couple others. Good choices, though."
,lopy,2006-02-09T05:29Z,me and 2 othe ppl are at 99.9% with no seeders......sum 1 help us
[V],NorseGuy,2006-04-24T20:18Z,"It's been on 99,9% for half a year now. Don't bot her to download ""The Dark Crystal"" as it is that one that will never finish. (I just tried downloading ""The Dark Crystal"" again after half a year and I stopped on 99,7% again, so I figure it's been that way since last time I tried downloading it). The two other movies will complete."
,galemann,2006-05-21T23:41Z,a reseed would be nice then!!  tnx for info norseguy
,token247gurl,2007-01-18T15:55Z,"someone fucking seed this

,yazzz,2007-03-05T09:23Z,"whoever is seeding, please please dont stop"
,dsl0_0lsd,2007-05-20T01:45Z,"Cool idĂŠa to put this collection thogether sicko! =)

Wouldn't quite call it a mind-fuck but rather a nice little stroll down memory lane accompanied by my favorite drug of choice...a freshly rolled joint...or two!

,greasetrap,2007-12-14T22:18Z,"Holy shit, I was just talking about how trippy these movies were."
,melquisedeq,2007-12-16T06:28Z,"Oi! Stuck at 99.9%.

,TYRRAM,2008-08-12T08:07Z,"um i thought you were talking sick horror or something really disturbing, these movies are just kinda gay. maybe you were being sarcastic i donno ?"
,Mosulrapist,2008-11-05T08:02Z,seeeeeeed :(
,Mr.t.Durden,2009-04-07T09:25Z,"honestly.... i like this torrent.. i never had heard of the dark crystal... although im sure i will enjoy it cause i know the other two movies are pretty twisted.... HOWEVER... im kinda (just a bit) disappointed that you didnt throw up ""return to oz"". if jack pumpkinhead doesnt give you nightmares and leave you in the fetal position at night then i dont see what a flying dog dragon or scary cartoon are gonna do to you...... and dont get me started on the rest of the movie... i watch it in chapters... fuck that. but for sure.. this torrent gets two thumbs up. "
