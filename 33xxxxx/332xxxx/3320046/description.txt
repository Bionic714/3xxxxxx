The Sickboy88 Childhood MindFuck Movie Pack Trilogy (20APR05)

----

I decided to do a little something different for a change...

I can't bring myself to watch 2/3 of these movies.  I am not sure why it is so mindfucking to watch them, but I just can't.  I ran the idea past my two best friends, who are also the same age as me, and all three of us agreed that these 3 movies, were indeed, the three most mindfucking movies that could be stuck into one torrent.  I think everyone will agree that they are great movies...one hell of a little collection...IF YOU CAN BRING YOURSELF TO WATCH THEM.  Yes I am deeply disturbed...so what?  It doesn't change the fact that this torrent will emotionally rape you.

Were you born in the 70's?  

You were!?!

Then here are three movies that will either have you staring into the barrel of a shotgun by the end of the night, or send you on one hell of a bender with your favorite drug of choice.
