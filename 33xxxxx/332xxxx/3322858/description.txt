Exe Password lets you protect any EXE file with its own password. It does this by storing the password directly in the EXE file. It is a simple matter to add a password to a file: Just select the desired file on the desktop, in the start menu or in Explorer, open the context menu by right-clicking, select Password protection, enter the password, and youâ€™re done. From that time on, a password will be required to run the EXE file.
