,elessarrex,2012-07-29T18:16Z,"A warning about this DL - the tags on the audio files are a bit wonky and will need doctoring before you can get them all to play in order. Also, unsure if last disk is complete (the audio files are still organized around the 11 CDs in the audiobook publication). Not saying for sure that it isn't, but there are 8 files with numberings in the style of Xof10, which makes me wonder...?"
,peamintcherry,2012-08-14T14:05Z,Thanks for this! I've been trying to read the PDF version but it's just so damn hard to read it ): I really hope I'll be able to understand it with this audiobook! Thanks!
