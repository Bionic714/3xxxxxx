,shilalydawg2,2011-02-16T21:00Z,"@Killahaji
You do realize Keygens are going to show up as a trojan or hacktool on 90% of decent AV's, right? Don't call someone else a dumbass when you don't even know what you're talking about. Thank you for YOUR ignorance and risk of corruption to other people's brain cells.

Have a nice day."
