,kylicek,2006-05-31T10:24Z,"Curious... Any way of making the links in this thing work? Without making them respond this manual is very difficult to use, since it's the CD just ripped page for page like images. Though I could be wrong about this, and just not know how to make the links respond. It would be a shame to let this man's work go to so much waste. Any help?"

,motoxyz,2008-01-13T21:32Z,"Wow.  4900 pages of heaven.  Great Upload.  Takes a second to load that much data when opening the file, but that's because it's a 100 mb pdf lol."
,Ookpic,2008-07-27T16:55Z,This manual is great except for the engine section.  It only has the 2.8L VR6 engine.  All other sections are great.
