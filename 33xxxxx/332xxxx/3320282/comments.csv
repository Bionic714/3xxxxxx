,foomonger,2005-04-28T23:57Z,"my copy has a big distorted chunk from around 1h 32m to 1h 40m.

I chopped the last 200MB off and downloaded that part again (no problems there) but the new film is exactly the same!

Anyone else? Is the original like this?

,sasman29,2010-06-13T19:32Z,"Befb:  Your movies are great and I seed regularly but this one has some bad sectors in this file.   I am trying to upload another.   Maybe you can post mine instead.

,zasta23,2010-09-11T01:00Z,"confirmed yet again..something definitely wrong! Do not download! About a year ago I burnt this to a dvd with some other movies...just today went to upload some of them onto my comp, but the disc info wouldn't even load properly to allow me to play any of them. I tried a bunch of times and couldn't figure out why this was the only disc in thousands that wouldn't load, when it looks brand new and I have very scratched discs that still load ok. Then I read all these comments,this copy of Alice must have ruined the whole disc of movies. Let's get another copy rolling. It's a shame when a substandard copy of a movie becomes the most seeded.  Go for this one instead:
