,absen,2009-12-17T20:29Z,I hope Tiesto dies in a fire for this one. What a shit bag to ruin a great pice of classical music by putting crappy trance over it. Exploitation of good music and a testament to the fact that he couldn't write something original or worth a shit without stealing it from someone else who's undoubtedly better.
,Technomancer,2011-09-05T17:04Z,Nice whining! He took a great piece and remade it his own way. If you dont like it dont go look for it.
