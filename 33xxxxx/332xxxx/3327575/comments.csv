,xax,2005-05-13T01:00Z,"Stupid gits! Why complaint when someone is uploading something? Don´t like  it - go somewhere else or better yet, upload something perfect (in your opinion) your selves =)"
,Xoxxa,2005-05-13T10:25Z,ITS ALL THERE ! check the filelist if you dont belive me!
,dx-,2005-05-28T06:10Z,"The only file missing here but can be found on torrentbytes is imdb.nfo	1.00 kB and that's not a nessecary file.

To the user who said that all releases should have all theese subtitles: Not all DVDRs are actually made with all this from the beginning (the original) You'll be able to find DVDRs with only 4 subtitles and some without any titles (ie. I've bought The Crow without any subs)"
,jhemstrom,2005-05-30T18:11Z,"Jag får felmeddelande då jag ska packa upp filerna.
Det står att jag inte har utrymme för mer an 4 Gb trots att jag har det. Sedan står det ngt om nts-filer (?).
Vad gör jag för fel?"
,filedaddy3,2005-05-31T03:21Z,"@jhemstrom

It's because your running FAT32 filesystem on your computer, to be able to unpack the files you need the NTFS file system, because FAT32 only supports files up to 4Gb and a DVDR is normally about 4.39Gb.

Hope this helps

Thanks to the uploader btw :D"
