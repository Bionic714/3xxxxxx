Pink Floyd Live At Pompeii 

The music of Pink Floyd - colorful, imaginative, surrealistic, and highly inventive - lends itself very well to visual representation. Shot in and around an ancient amphitheatre among the ruins of old Pompeii,  Pink Floyd treat the viewer to a stunning audio-visual experience, the like of which has not been seen outside their sell-out concerts. this session was skilfully recorded in the beautiful sun-splashed arena by day, and amidst the eerily-lit scene of volcanic destruction by night, and is a perfect transition from audio to video media. The set begins and ends with the massive composition "Echoes" from the album "Meddle". 

This is a dvd rip of the original theatrical version from 1971, and is about 60 minutes long and consists only of the concert recordings from Pompeii.
