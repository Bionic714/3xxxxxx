,pappybear,2005-05-02T10:47Z,"Ok thats not a problem with the program, 

login to the site from its main page,

if posting a program of this nature is prohibited by the sites rules then im sorry, the sites rules are in a language that i dont understand, and for some reason altavistas translation script didnt work,


maybe rather than going crazy for posting a program that works, you people should go crazy at the people who post spyware and other malicious programs. 

just a thought"
,Bully,2005-05-02T11:40Z,"The program doesnt work with anything else than IE.

That was the ""problem"" :-)"
,rat3000,2005-05-02T17:19Z,"A little feedback to your program pappybear!

The search interval should be between 15-20 sconds, the searches are going way to fast and the chances that they find out are greater. 

You might wat to change that in v2 or something. :P"
