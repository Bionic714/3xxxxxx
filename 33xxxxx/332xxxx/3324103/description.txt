The pathogen is unknown. Dr. Jack Mason en route to assess threat levels. Request cryogenic containment of infected subject 'B': Karina J.

From the creators of UnrealÂ® comes a spiraling plunge into destruction, despair and disease. Jack Mason is a burned-out doctor with no will to live, that is, until he nearly dies in a transport crash. Now he and his infected patient are stranded deep within the most vicious prison sectors of a wasteland called 'Earth'. In sixteen hours an orbital platform will initiate a total biohazard containment procedure: 50-megaton yield, detonated above sea level, to cleanse the contamination.


Known for creating games with incredibly rich dynamic graphics and mind-blowing fine-tuned gameplay, including the recent smash hit Unreal Tournament 2004, Digital Extremes is reaching beyond the limits with its most ambitious project to date. Pariah is utilizing the power of a heavily modified Unreal engine with state-of-the-art Havok physics technology that produces stunning settings, lifelike characters and tremendously satisfying in-your-face first-person action.
