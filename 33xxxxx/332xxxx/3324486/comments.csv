Im pretty new to torrents etc and i have a small problem.
i use frostwire and got to 60% of this album and my little neice aborted it accidentally and now i cant seem to find how to get it to resume.
ive deleted my files and the download from my system but when i start a new download it keeps saying i have the files and just stays on .""Aborted"".
i know this isnt a help forum and ive checked frostwire FAQ and am lost.
PLEEEESE help as ill seed till death!"
