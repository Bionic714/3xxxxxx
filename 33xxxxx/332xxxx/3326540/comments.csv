,Brandis,2005-05-06T14:45Z,"It's not certain it's a scene rip just 'cause you found it in a .RAR.

...But it's most certainly NOT a scene rip if you get it in just one .rar-archive!!"
,kosh,2005-05-06T14:52Z,"well i never made it at home , i downloaded this in november2003 it was ripped by some scene then eh"
