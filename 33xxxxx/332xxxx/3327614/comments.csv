,n3M351s,2009-08-23T06:09Z,"I'm having the same problem as you Thyrfing8989. When I run the setup the InstallShield pops up and after it get to 99% is disappears. The process is still running from Task Manager but nothing on the screen. I've tried running in compatability mode to no avail as the os.dat file doesn't appear to support after the Windows NT 4.0 build. 

From the comments on this torrent so far it doesn't sound like anyone actually got into the game. I wouldn't waste my downloads, find another torrent, however if anyone can get it to work post up what you did!"
,jllomax2001,2010-11-19T18:17Z,"OK, to ppl that are having probs with the installer, I have Win 7 and I have noticed that with older games, i have to let the installer sit for awhile.  It will show everything that you are seeing, and then disappear, then about 2-3 mins later, it comes up. I did this with this game and it installed fine and I can now play it like it is right out of the box."
,anarky321,2011-01-05T23:52Z,"this game is like Settlers 4 on steroids in terms of micromanagement, if you liked Settlers 2/3/4 you'll probably love this game"
