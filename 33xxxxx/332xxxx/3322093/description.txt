There isn't much to say about this one.  I like it.  I did this for myself because I wanted to see if all of the RESTORED VERSION hype was true...and you know what?  It is.

Fucking mind-blowing visual tits.  It's amazing what a fully equipped studio can do these days.  It looks like a movie that JUST came out.  If you compare it to even the unrestored version on DVD, you will STILL shit yourself at the difference in image quality.

What better movie to encode with XviD 1.1.0 Beta 2?  Oh, and I didn't space out on including the .idx this time, so the subtitles are complete on this film...English and French, in VOBsub format.

Check this out...2 hours 12 minutes....700megs, not 1400megs.  Is there really an excuse to EVER make a movie into 2 disks? Take a look at the quality and then tell me if it's EVER worth it to make a movie in 2 parts.

If you are going to watch this, you'll want to install the NEW XviD codec:

Now at Beta 2!

http://www.koepi.org/XviD-1.1.0-Beta2-04042005.exe

For top quality, make sure you use the XviD decoder configerator, and turn
on (Y) and (UV) deblocking, and the new feature of
XviD 1.1.0 (Y) and (UV) DERINGING.

If you have a slow computer, please turn off pre-processing. I don't want
another stupid motherfucker telling me that my movies are out of sync
because they are totally computer illiterate.
