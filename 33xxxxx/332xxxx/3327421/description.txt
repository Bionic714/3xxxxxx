Taxi3: eXtreme Rush (c) Team6-games

    Game Notes:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~
    On a bad day, somebody steals your precious black cab. No more crazy taxi 
    rides for you! For many days you try to search the crime location for clues, 
    but you are already starting to realize that it's gone: and it's never going 
    to be the same again without it.
    
    On the fourth day after the theft, an expensive Lambatti drives by and the
    driver of this car recognizes you immediatly: ypu are the most famous 
    taxi-driver of London! He thinks that some of his contacts, in the underground
    midnight racing club, might know who stole your special, supercharged twin-V8 
    black cab.
    
    Once you enter the underground scene, you will have to use all your skills to 
    win. Don't expect easy competition because you are an experienced driver: 
    you've never raced in such extreme cars, at such high speed and with such
    danger, ever before.

    The more races you win, the more respect and money you will earn. The more
    respect you have, the more contacts you will get and the closer you will get 
    to your precious black cab.
