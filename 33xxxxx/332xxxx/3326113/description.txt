<b>Suzhou River - China 2000</b>
  The Suzhou River flowing through Shanghai is a reservoir of filth, chaos, and poverty, but also a meeting place for memories and secrets. Mardar is a motorcycle courier in his mid-twenties that rides all over the city delivering packages. Because of his good looks and habit of not asking questions, he gets involved with shady clients. This leads him to meet Moudan, the teenage daughter of an alcohol smuggler. However, his shady connections come back to haunt him and causes him to lose Moudan. Now, after being released from jail and in search of his lost love, Mardar meets Meimei. Could Meimei be his long lost Moudan?
