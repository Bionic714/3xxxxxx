,risby,2005-08-17T20:45Z,"Is it just me or is this movie compromissed badly? It wasn't at all 24 fps like all other movies. The quality was good but the frames per second where a bit behind making the game feel ""laggy"".
Don't think it's my codecs, use ffdshow and watched it in MPC (tried WMP, Power DVD and VLC Player too). Still, great movie!"
,shikkaman,2006-07-07T13:05Z,Thanx alot for this nice movie. *thumbs up*
,Aless,2006-09-16T09:54Z,Please seed! Thank you!
,spikyyy,2007-01-06T01:38Z,"Just FYI, the subtitles are absolutely terrible. Typos, grammar errors, and pretty much everything. Most of the time the words dont even match what they;re saying like in the syllables game. ""tits""? wtf. Ice-cream is ""station""? C'mon a third grader coulda subbed this better.

Besides that the video quality ain't bad. "
,kipz61,2009-06-25T00:13Z,"Video itself is good, but the subtitles are absolutely terrible."
