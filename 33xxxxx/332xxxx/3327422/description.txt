NOTES:
  1. Our Hacked SaveGame allows you to Race using the Class 0 & Class 3 cars.  
     This is normally impossible during the game, but we enabled them for fun.  
     They show up as "Class 0" vehicles in the Car Selection screen because you 
     should not be able to use them, without our Hack.
     Read the manual for more info about these Vehicles.

     You will see TWO Police cars in the Car Selection.  The SECOND one is the 
     Parked version, which has a license plate of "M-72 LAW".  The first one 
     has Sirens and Lights on it, looking like a true Police car.

  2. Also, be aware that this game is styled after "Need For Speed" (c)EA Games.
     So even though we unlocked the Initial Five Race Modes, there will be more 
     later on.  You will meet more "Race Contact" people who give you different 
     events to Race at.  However, there is no way to UNLOCK all the stuff 
     simultaneously.  It is a progression system.  You may also need to earn 
     more Money and Respect later on, to access new Races that will appear.

  3. The game immediately Terminates itself on Win 98 even though the developer 
     web site says it supports both Win 98 and XP.  Even on XP it seems very 
     glitchy, frequently messing up textures and making jerky movements.
     So beware!

  4. Nonetheless, it can be a fun game, using the Hacked vehicles we enabled.  
     The Broth500 is FAST AS HELL.  And the Bus is awesome for just running 
     down other cars; it's like a freaking TANK.
