,1hasoo,2008-04-15T16:02Z,"I have played hundreds of videos but this one did not play in vlc, zoomplayer, winamp or kmplayer. so I checked it out in GSpot which says it is an uinknown file type. Further, mousing over the file in Explorer I see that It has no sound and no video. I conclude that no one can play this file but why is no one reporting that it is unplayable?"
