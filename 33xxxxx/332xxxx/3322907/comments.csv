,Plumbo,2005-04-28T23:46Z,"This is with real ppl (not animated), i don't thin any of the ppl in it are real actors. It my understanding the total cost of the movie was about $20.000, the got some realy cool effects in it. I will recomend all of you Star Wars ppl to download it, all in all it's a good movie. At least i think so :p "
,sealjo,2005-04-29T10:05Z,"For a fanfic this movie is awesome. Actually, considering the budget it's awesome in every aspect. 40 minutes that has a higher quality than many regular movies with budgets of atleast $20.000.000 made for 0.1% of the cost. "
