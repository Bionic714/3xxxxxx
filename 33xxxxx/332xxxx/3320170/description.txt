Holmes

The band Holmes comes from the small town Vänersborg in Sweden. It was formed in January 2003 by Kristoffer Bolander, Lars Löfgren and Johannes Björk. Daniel Zackrisson joined the band after their first demo and they went on a short tour. Recently Johan Björklund and Björn Holm joined the band.
I saw them live in Vänersborg recently, and they were great!
