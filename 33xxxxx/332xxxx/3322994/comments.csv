,harigata,2008-11-05T09:33Z,"As opposed to so many spanish speaking rippers who don't give a FUCK about the community and don't bother to specify the fact that their torrent is dubbed in their fucked-up language anywhere on the torrent's page or title, this guy did warn us. The torrent's title is in spanish. It says ""espa単ol"" in the description field. I guess actually filling the 'spoken language' field would have been best, but hell, that would be asking for too much....."
