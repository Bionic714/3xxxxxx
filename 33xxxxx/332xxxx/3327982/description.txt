RELEASE NOTES/DESCRIPTION:
The moment demand outspaces supply, water be comes a commodity to be traded in the global market. 
But who owns the rights to water? In this program, the pros and cons of privatization are assessed 
in a number of water management situations around the world: Aguas Argentina in Buenos Aires; the 
Bechtel corporation in Cochabmba, Bolivia; Thames Water company in Jakarta; and a public/private 
test partnership in Albania. Corporate reprsentatives, anti-privatization activists, farmers, and 
industry experts offer commentary from all sides of the issue.
