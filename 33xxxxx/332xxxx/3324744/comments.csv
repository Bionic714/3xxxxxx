,lyp,2005-05-03T03:11Z,what's a good source for dorama?  any place to get long vacation (really old)?
,Hansol666,2005-05-03T03:12Z,"www.d-addicts.com is the only place for Dramas.
Well probably not the only place but the only one that matters."
,watwegsw,2005-05-04T19:22Z,"wonderful upload :D ive seen this series and its wonderful!

and good sources are as said d-addicts.com, but there are fansubbers who dont release their stuff there 
For example JTV (who got an active batch torrent for Long Vacation) - http://japan-tv.afraid.org:6969/
