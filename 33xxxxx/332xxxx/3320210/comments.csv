Would been nice with a newer version.."
,McKack,2005-04-24T07:06Z,"I'd wish there were a CS 1.5 with z-bots... 1.6 is when CS died in my eyes, and CSS is beyond all that is the soul of real CS. Only newbs that haven't played the original CS as of  version 1.0 can really enjoy CSS beceause they don't know how good it was back in the days..."
,shoot_me,2005-04-25T20:44Z,you can install cs from the cs and uppdate it to 1.5 and then install z-bots....
