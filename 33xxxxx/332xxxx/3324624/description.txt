NB.
1: Could not find any other nordic subtitles but danish and swedish to add on this movie. Sorry.

2: Because my upload speed is only 50 kb/s it will take at least 3-5 days before there is more than one seeder.
So don’t scream for more seeders. It won’t help.
 
3: Thanks to the people who made the subs.
Danish sub: ukendt
Swedish sub: Fingal61, Janne



Enjoy.
