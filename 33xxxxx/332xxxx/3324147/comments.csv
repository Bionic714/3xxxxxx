What is it good for? What do you do with it?""

don't really know...
I'm just using it to make some ""effect's"" on my rendered sounds I made in other program, such as Fruity loops. or maybe just mastering some recording's I made.

It's really good, You learn alot from it. It's just like a real studio. "
,lennart_jo,2005-05-02T00:47Z,"if u miss file.cue, 
just rename file.bin to file.bin.iso
(so u know it's renamed)
and then u can burn it"

,Nex699,2005-05-02T23:43Z,98.2% done. A seed would be great. 
,overkill47,2005-05-04T15:07Z,"What do you mean working?

I have version 3 right now with the dongle crack sysacc.dll to get it to work is this the same with yours?

Surely you need crack to get by the dongle check and if it is its the same version I have, then its not ""fully"" working cause it crashes on some menu options.

So tell me if its same one or not?"
,Deviation,2005-05-04T16:00Z,It won't matter anyway unless another seeder jumps on...everyone's been stuck at 98.2% for the last two or three days

,badjokes,2005-07-10T19:20Z,"i can't belive how many retards are using ports from 6881-6999 as there range, you ISP closes off these ports, you need to pick a port in the range of 45000-60000 if you want any high download speeds also open the posrt in your firewall (local+remote) and in your router, you only need to open one port for most good clients.

,D14BL0,2005-07-19T05:45Z,"Why the hell do I keep getting ""Corrupted file"" errors at around 93%?"
,D14BL0,2005-07-19T13:59Z,"Ah, it finished. Anyway, if anybody is in serious need of a .CUE file for CD1, just open up one of the other .CUE files in NotePad or some other text editor. Copy/paste it into a new text document. The only thing you need to change in the body of the text document is that instead of ""B"" at the end (if you used the .CUE from CD2) or ""C"" at the end (if you used the .CUE from CD3) in the first line of code, change it to ""A"". Do the same with the filename. Also be sure to change the file from .TXT to .CUE when you save it into the CD1 folder.

To burn with Nero, right-click the .CUE file and select ""Open With"" and select Nero. You may have to browse for the EXE in your program files if it's not on the suggested programs list. Then just hit burn and you're off. "
