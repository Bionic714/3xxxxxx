,Kouartise,2006-11-26T03:00Z,"well im not sure wether it worked. i entered the name an serial code an then hit enter. an then underneath it straight away said- quicktime 7 pro. but i dont know wether this has made it a pro version, cause i tried saving an online video from apple by ctrl an then save to quicktime file. but the field saying ""save to quicktime"" was like ""disabled"" and i couldnt save it. im confused wether it worked or not. an if it did. can someone tell me what the advantages are in quicktime pro to normal quicktime.
cheers."
,spiralgirl,2006-12-29T07:47Z,"Okay it works great.  Just enter the Pablo/nop in the Registered to section and then add serial number.  Then hit enter or click the red button to close it.  Then click on the quicktime in the dock and then go to the top under quicktime player and click the about quicktime and it will say quicktime pro version 7.1

,hotafsean,2007-07-26T12:52Z,"it was great. all you got to do is... go to Quicktime 7 under your applications. Open it. Go to registration.. under ""Quicktime player"" and enter all the info. After that all you got to do is close it. The way you know you did it is by Going back to ""Quicktime Player"" and  take a look at ""About Quicktime Player"" and it will have PRO under the ""Quicktime"" Logo. BTW not that hard!!!!! "
,joecarleone,2007-08-06T09:33Z,"hi evryone! i just downloaded it and i think it worked, but is it suppose to look like the old version?? because i dont see that its written quicktime pro anywhere??

Another pretty simple way to tell if its worked -
open Quicktime, click 'file' then 'new movie recording'. It should let you record your own flick if you got a cam connected."
