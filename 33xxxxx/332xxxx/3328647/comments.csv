,CloudXIII,2006-06-20T04:32Z,"Seed plz, only goes by 1kb/s now :P"
,thereaperd,2006-06-30T23:27Z,Currently Seeding it.  I've ran into some issues with the FF X OST tracks.  Some of them will begin with the correct track and then cut to a completely different one midway through.  Anyone else getting this or do I have a bad copy?  (This would suck as I am at 91.4% done)
,thereaperd,2006-06-30T23:36Z,Never mind about that last comment other then I am seeding it.  Haven't had sleep in 24 hours and being a dork. (Need to remember to check file completion % before complaining about bad tracks.)
,reelmojo,2006-07-03T02:12Z,I'm downloading this right now. Once it's done I plan on seeding it as much as possible so if anyone else who already has it could jump on and seed that'd be awesome.
,coredoom,2006-07-04T21:59Z,"DL it right now, and I´m gonna seed this one for  a long time after I´m done. So just jump on the train and help eveyone to get this awesome compilation!"
,coredoom,2006-07-07T22:18Z,Plenty of seeders so far. Nice to see!
,reelmojo,2006-07-09T20:39Z,"For anyone interested, just wanted to let you know that this is 86 hours, 51 minutes, and 30 seconds or music.  The only albums I can think of that are missing are Advent Children, More Friends (Los Angeles Concert), Final Fantasy XII, and Final Fantasy XI: Treasures of Aht Urgan.  This took me a week to download on DSL, but it was well worth it.  There's some stuff in there that I didn't even know existed like such as an opera version of Aria de Mezzo Carraterre."
,Jope92,2006-07-16T22:40Z,"Great torrent. This is all i need in my life. I promise that i keep seeding this long time. Thanks for the greatest torrent ever, Brightbrute."

,t3hc411,2007-12-08T08:20Z,"Is there any way someone could upload the FF9 soundtrack separately? This torrent tried to kill my computer with its massive size, and 9's the only one I want. @_@

And I could really care less if it's lossless or not. In fact, I'd rather it wasn't."
