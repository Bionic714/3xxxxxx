,Cine666,2006-05-21T17:32Z,"I have sent Gpz900R a message, asking him to seed it again. Unfortunately he doesn't have it anymore. So all of us stuck on 71.6% can stop worrying. We won't get it! Which is sad, but it's more than a year now since he uploaded it. It seems I have to order it and buy it! (ouch!)"
