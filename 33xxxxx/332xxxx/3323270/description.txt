[Story]

"Journey of Life" reveals how the basic blueprint of a      
brain, backbone, two legs and two arms was created in the   
ocean; why crabs took to dry land and what the biggest      
creature ever to fly - a pterosaur the size of a small       
plane - really looked like.  It examines the relationships - 
predatory, competitive and co-operative - on which species   
survival depend; considers the ascent of man in the          
evolutionary ladder - and determines how, uniquely, we have  
managed to break free from it.                               

Programme 5 of 5 : Human Life                                

Five million years ago we separated from our chimpanzee      
cousins. Steve Leonard looks back to explain how landscape   
changes drew us down from the trees and out on to the newly  
formed African savannah.                                     

[Notes]

No normal subtitles are included on this DVD so I've         
included English hard-of-hearing subtitles for those who     
are not too clued up with the spoken English language :)
