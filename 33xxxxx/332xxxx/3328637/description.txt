This is the down sized version of the-only-ripped " The thing " of 7.25Gb that's been circulating here.
Because of the time and effort it took me to produce a workable movie from those bloody BUP&VOB-files, I figured I'd post my version for those interested in not throwing their computer out the window.....
So, here goes....
#####################################
Menu...Untouched
Extras/Bonus...Partially removed/compressed
Main movie...Untouched
Subs...Swe-No-Da-Fi, French, Portugese, Chech and Dutch
#####################################
There was a documentory where the directors/actors and crew could tell people and the camera how much they loved doing this film and the people they got to work with and....blah blah wouf wouf....and so on. That's what I cut out - the rest is there, partly compressd but mostly untouched.

Enjoy
