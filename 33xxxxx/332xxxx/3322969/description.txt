Fucking very cool movie.  This movie stars Bruce Campbell (Ash from Evil Dead Series)...there, you don't even need to know what the movie is about, because he's the main character.  The dialouge is funny as hell, be sure to check this one out for sure.

XviD Beta 2, with optional external subtitles in French, Spanish, and English in VOBsub format.

Mini Plot:

Elvis Presley (Bruce Campbell) is an elderly resident in an East Texas rest home; seems he switched identities with an impersonator years before his death and then missed his chance to switch back. The King teams up with Jack (Ossie Davis), a fellow nursing home resident who thinks he's John F. Kennedy, and the two old codgers prepare to battle an evil Egyptian entity that's chosen their long-term care facility as its happy hunting grounds.

If you have a slow computer, please turn off pre-processing. I don't want
another stupid motherfucker telling me that my movies are out of sync
because they are totally computer illiterate.
