Palin, quite a remarkable man. The Documentary follows him around one of the most culturally diverse region in the world. He goes through the Himilaya mountains and surrounding regions. This man, makes you feel very comfortable watching him, there is no arrogance when he speaks to you and he goes into such depth, without repeating!. He speaks with passion when he describes or explains, which makes him extremely entertaining, as well as never backing out of any challenges he is confronted by!. This man is one of the greatest documentarians of our time, A True national treasure!. I give this excellent piece of work 10/10, This guy keeps reaching!, his documentaries get better and better!.
