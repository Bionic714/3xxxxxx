The addition of Steve Hackett on guitar and Phil Collins on drums brought the band closer to a progressive rock idiom, as Hackett introduced a more aggressive, electronic sound, and Collins brought the dexterity and power necessary to add a bit of an edge to the wimpey-ness.

Highlights of the album include the almost flawless "Musical Box", which epitomizes the strengths of the progresive rock genre. At times restrained, at times roaring, the song moves through a number of motifs while not getting bogged down in the pretentiousness so many bands fall into. Another song I enjoy is the melancholy "Seven Stones", which uses the old prog gimmick of drowning the listener in Mellotron. I won't complain. I also like the acoustic numbers, "For Absent Friends" and "Harlequin", which may commit the cardinal sin of not being ten minutes long, but are at least not boring
