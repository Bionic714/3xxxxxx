FKK released this about month ago but their release had skips. For example track 508 @ 4:30-> (in our release it's track 108). Also other tracks had minor skips. So we decided to rip whole release  properly without  those  nasty skips / pops.  We also included cover scans and correct track order. This CD-BOX deserves to be ripped properly! No hard feelings FKK!"
