It's a good disk, I'm agree (I have it on CD). But it's not ambient. Electronic mix of opera things... Ambient should be more quiet and more far from classic music...  
And there is no ""Cafe del mar"" there (on my CD). This disk created by Paul Schwartz. May be your disk is localization for your coutry? Don't understand...
Anyway, the disk is very good =) "
