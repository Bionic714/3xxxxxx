,Equilibrium1,2005-05-06T00:28Z,Is this the Widesceen Version?
,aM1bEK,2005-05-06T00:54Z,"According to dvd-basen.dk and imdb.com there's no anamorphic widescreen DVD released in region 1 (NTSC mostly used in R1 and R2, Japan) as of this date yet. Only letterboxed versions. There're anamorphic releases in R2,Europe (i.e. PAL) though."
,aM1bEK,2005-05-06T01:01Z,"Sorry. My bad :) There's anamorphic widescreen release in R1 titled as Cube (Special Edition or Signature Series):

But the question is if the one in this topic is widescreen or fullscreen? And if widescreen is it anamorphic or letterboxed?"

,negativeions,2005-05-19T20:32Z,Who the hell releases a DVD that's not anamorphic widescreen? You might as well shoot yourself in the face. Jesus christ... and this is a Canadian film isn't it? or directed by a Canadian director or something like that.... go figure...
