You want a cool little handy Mp3 player try this one...

@MAX Tray Player is a small, easy to use but also fairly 
powerful multimedia player. 
It is designed for those who like to listen to music while working 
on the computer. 
It embeds itself into Windows taskbar virtually becoming a part 
of Windows. Thus it doesn't obscure desktop and user application 
windows while always being at hand.


And to top all that, TrayPlayer is absolutely free
