,albertii,2007-08-12T13:46Z,"I really need the Limewire Pro Version for Mac OS 9

Can someone with Limewire Pro access please seed this specific version

Limewire Pro 4.0.10 for Classic (AKA Mac OS 9)

It's still available as a free version download, so it must also be as the Pro version for registered users

Thx"

I will continue seeding for 10-12 hours & maybe some more later (expect it to be gone for about 10 hours & then seeded for about 10-12 hours) but i wont continue seeding too long for i'm in a situation where this is eating my monthly allowed bandwith

Please take ovr the seeding if u like"
