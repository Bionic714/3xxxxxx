This is a test, really, but I'm gonna post it here since no one really ever checks the test forum. This is a "techno" punk band from Belgium, but waaaayyy more punk than techno.
All the songs are tagged so I'm not gonna list them now...it's their first album. Please let me know if this ain't working. Thanks...
