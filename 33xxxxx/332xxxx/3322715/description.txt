Ok, here was a movie I have never heard of, which ended up blowing me away.  I love this movie.  It's best to go into this movie not knowing a single thing about it.  Surprise is at least 50% of this movie's greatness.

It's a horror movie and it's violent...that's all you need to know.  Trust me, by the middle of the movie, you'll be very glad that you didn't go to IMDB and read up on this movie beforehand.

This is not even a B movie, it's a major release, yet somehow, it never made it.  Fucking talk about lack of advertising.  You would be lucky to find a single copy of this at the largest of video rental stores, and yet, right next to it, there will be 30 copies of the most retarded shit you've even seen.  It just isn't right that shit like this happens.

A great movie...a girl as the lead character...oh...look for Adam Stubbs' COLLEGE FILM...you'll die laughing when you get to this part in the movie.  It was great.

Don't let the DivX encoding get you down.  The quality is great...I wouldn't upload a piece of shit.

I STILL use DivX...there are some movies that just look better in DivX instead of XviD...such as 16 candles, pulp fiction, and the passion of the christcicle stick. I recently redid Pulp Fiction in xvid 1.1.0 beta 2, and deleted it, because it didn't best the DivX 5.2 for anyone that compared the two.
