,MrSandman,2005-05-12T10:43Z,"Hey relax dudes! Gör som Dragonfly_80 säger...använd Dvd-shrink, sänk kvalitén på extramaterialet med 1% eller ta bort alla onödiga subtitles så får den lätt plats på en enkel dvd-skiva. Funkar hur bra som helst och kvalitén är superb! "

,xkexkexke,2008-03-02T12:56Z,"Very nice movie with Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson. They come back with 
the hilarious sequel of their previous adventure-comedy Shanghai Noon.
When Chong Wang get news of his estranged father's murder in Shanghai, 
he leaves his honorable life as Carson City's sherrif in a cloud of 
dust and reunites with his yarn-spinning sidekick, Roy O'Bannon (Owen 
Wilson). They make their way to London together on a daring quest for 
revenge and honor...For more information go to
