,Sevir,2008-02-14T01:19Z,"I know that many of you, like me, are dead tired of torrents that are broken or mislabeled. It is my goal to provide a comment on all the torrents I download that includes any information that the original uploader omitted and also rates the torrent on overall quality using a simple five-point scale as well as any applicable virus, ad and spy-ware warnings"
,Sevir,2008-02-14T01:31Z,"Quality: 4-Great.

Warning: Benign.
It did not trigger my anti-virus, which may have been a fluke, but most key generators will trip most virus scanners because of their illegal nature, It will not harm your computer.
That said, my advise is to delete the keygen after use to prevent your anti-virus from nagging you every so often and if you want to keep it for a back-up keep the zip folder."
