,B0bba,2005-05-09T18:38Z,"thanks man, now if you could help me get episode 187-219, do you know if this fan subbing group have released more fan subbed episodes or earlier episodes of OP and if there's an irc Chanel, or if you know of other groups that have/are realised/realising OP fan subs"
,trotos,2005-05-11T14:11Z,"try this:

go and find the bittorent...they have from 001-140 great quality great sub (i think)

does it worth the dnlding?"
,MackanZoor,2005-05-18T14:58Z,"I know the man translating for [BalF] and I'm afraid he's too lazy to continue subbing OP. Maybe one more episode but that's it. Or maybe he changes his mind and starts subbing again, I don't know.. =) Can push him a bit.

K-F are slow. Oh-Snap had begun subbing OP (and they are _fast_) but stopped now due to K-F's bitching.

They were to co-op for fast release but K-F started bitching like the girls they are and slapped Oh-Snap around a bit. =( Damn shame, them K-F. And what's up with K-F complaining about every filler episode? Don't they want people to watch OP?

I also want to get up to ep 219 so I can watch Gerusama's subs. ;_; Let's just hope for some boost in the subbing department to fill the gap (ep 186 to 219 hasn't been subbed by anybody yet)."
,Dreadale,2005-05-19T12:40Z,MackanZoor you bitch alot for someone accusing others of bitching. Besides K-F are doing a great job and they aren't slow at all... about one ep in 5 days is more than you'll be able to expect from most groups. What is it with people like you? do you not get that these guys get _nothing_ out of subbing EXECPT some freaking gratitude from the guys watching the damn subs? 
,MackanZoor,2005-05-19T17:20Z,"(reposting since my last post didn't show up at all/correct)

I'm not saying they're not doing a great job, without them OP wouldn't have been discovered by many. But they do bitch. And complain about the series so-called fillers. And god damned how they bitch.

You say they are fast? Dattebayo make great subs of Naruto within only 6 hours. The only reason they release once per week is because they don't have anything to translate. I'm not saying that K-F should work themselves to death for nothing but our gratitude, but maybe if they co-oped with other people we could catch up to where the series are today. But nay."
,bugmenot1,2005-05-28T09:36Z,"your hallucinating if you think they do 1 ep in 5 days

yeah k-f does good work, but that is offset by how shit slow they are...and they are slow slow slow
"
,insearchof,2005-07-03T22:21Z,"Right now K-f has subbed up to ep. 149 and i am patiently waiting on 150. They're not slow, so ppl should stop complaining. Great Job K-F !!!"
,Draynor,2005-07-28T15:18Z,hhmm any one have 154+  ?
,Audioslaver,2006-04-17T01:29Z,"tnx for the upload, now i dont have to watch thoose crapy Hell HK.. do you have any more of these? like 187-190 or something? or maybe morE? i know after getting to 209 i can watch the BalF, but from 182 there arent any good uploads.. just Hell HK.. 
(i really hope for new OP watchers that there would be more episodes from BalF, Kaizoku, Gerusama or Raaw, because watching Hell HK is almost hurting:P)"
