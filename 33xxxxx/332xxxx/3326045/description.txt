Bombanfall - Two Moons Rising - 7 Inch
 
Here is a 7" from Bombanfall, also known as Two Moons Rising. Released in 1987 this is one of the best hardcorerecords ever! Really heavy and brutal. A true milestone in the history of hardcore. 
Not my rip, 128 kbps. Sorry about the low bitrate. 

Enjoy!
