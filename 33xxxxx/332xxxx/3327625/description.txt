For those who have downloaded my CS2 DVD this is CD7 of the CS2 Premium package. I didn't include it in the DVD because it has its own autorun, installer and menus, and my aim was simply to produce a single disc from which to install the full suite. I'm told that the content of CD7 can be downloaded from Adobe Public servers (though I can't find it!!) but cannot be run if burned to CD!

Enjoy!!!
