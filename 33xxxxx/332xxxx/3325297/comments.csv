,petsel,2005-05-04T13:34Z,"Hey
I am alittle confused here... It says episodes....Is this a part of the series or is it a movie ??? And if it is a serie what season ?? 
"
,petsel,2005-05-04T13:46Z,"And another thing...

Does anyone have season 4 od Babylon 5 ?? I could only find 1-3 here =(("
,hultnisse,2005-05-04T14:10Z,"FYI: Crusade is a follow up series that takes place after season 5 of babylon 5. A few of the characters from b5 shows up from time to time but the main cast is new.

It's a good series, well worth watching but not quite as good as the original b5."
,john170950,2005-05-05T00:00Z,13 episodes on one DVD must be a collection of xvid or divx or something?
,john170950,2005-05-05T00:02Z,"Ah yes, I checked the file list, they're avi's.  I guess this is not a dvd then.  should be in another category."
,Gnul,2005-05-08T19:58Z,"Går seint dette her. Men seeder det eg kan. Har desverre ikkje allverden linje. Så ha tolmod.
P.S sorry for the wrong category. It is 13. episodes with a collection of xvid. "
,Gnul,2005-05-11T11:38Z,"Seeder til 14 mai.  Så får andre ta over.
Beklager det men trenger linja.
Om dette skaper problemer så send meg ei melding så fikser vi den opp igjen."
