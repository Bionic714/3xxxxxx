,ReNZoR888,2005-04-28T17:25Z,"Btw, there are alot wrong titles on season 2:( Every single one is wrong:("
,ge5239,2005-04-29T14:06Z,"it's the releasenames. would be more wrong if they were changed, even though they were wrong. 
and most files doesnt even include episode-name... "

,ReNZoR888,2005-04-29T20:10Z,Can you tell me if you have any other series?
,Orusaka,2005-04-29T21:20Z,"Of course I have other series, but I'd rather have people request things, than listing what I have. I can probably reveal that, unless some request I like comes along, will be two guys and a girl or grounded for life."
