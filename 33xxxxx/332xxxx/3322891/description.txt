WHAT WAS BITCHES BREW? 

Bitches Brew was a 2-LP set released by Miles Davis in April 1970.

It marked the line of demarcation between the sound of all music before it appeared, and after. Miles Davis and music of the 20th Century would never sound the same again. Bitches Brew soon went gold . . . Miles' first. 

He had created a new sound yet again . . . an eerie, nocturnal, and very funky sound. A dark, simmering Brew that could only have come from the mind of Miles Davis . . . a synthesis of Sly Stone, James Brown, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Miles' world. 

Bitches Brew is certainly one of the most important recordings ever made . . . and definitely one of the most unexpected and controversial. It has entered the pantheon of myth. . . somewhat like the music of Robert Johnson.
