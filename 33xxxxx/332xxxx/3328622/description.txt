First of all if you post questions on the forums that answered are in this 
file but are offended by someone telling you to read the instructions first
before posting - then you should send a PM to a mod or admin - just so
they can reply "RTFM NOOB" or something to that effect. If you are too lazy
to read about how something works then dont be surprised if people are too
lazy to help.

Hacked bios's or any software for that matter will always have a bug or two.
We can make them as rock solid as you like but there is always one common
denominator that we cannot solve - the guy who has done everything correctly
and his Xbox no longer works - so naturally the bios sucks and we should
either fix it or prepare to be flamed to his/her last breath. Hint - don't
blame the tools (and/or use common sense and always have a recovery plan)

The words knob jockey come to mind.

In a nut shell read the info below - its all pretty basic. THE ONE SIMPLE RULE
we ask of you is to MAKE SURE YOU USE THE X2CONFIG.INI THAT COMES PACKED WITH 
EACH NEW RELEASE. FAR TOO MANY PPL IGNORE THIS THEN BITCH AT US WHEN THEIR SHIT 
DOES NOT WORK CUS THEY USED A 5028 INI FILE ON 5031 - OR THEY USED A 3RD PARTY
INI FILE CREATOR THAT WAS NEVER DESIGNED FOR THE LATEST BIOS. I know there are
a few ppl out there reading this right now and feeling your ears burning right?

THIS RELEASE IS SOLID. ITS A CHAMP. WE ARE REAL HAPPY WITH IT. I AND MANY MANY TESTERS
HAVE KNOCKED THE SHIT OUT OF IT IN EVERY CONFIGURATION POSSIBLE - ERRORS ARE USER
ERRORS OR NOT FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS - THATS IT. PERIOD.

IF THERE ARE BUGS THEY WILL BE SIMPLE ONES THEY WILL NOT FUCK YOUR XBOX UP.

On another note - reports from some DUOX2 users saying this bios doesn't work on 
your chip. Solution: get them to fix the problem - it's hardware not the bios.
i'm sure there is a moral to that somewhere ?

>> Release Information

Well, we're back. Its been just over a year since we last worked 
on the X2 Bios series and what a year it's been. With the phenominal 
success of the X3 Mod hardware and software now on the market we felt
that it was about time we went back to visit an old freind.

We figured we should give the scene a boost with the release of a 
decent bios that works on ALL chips (that support a 512k bios at least).
So you see, Xecuter even has some love for Xenium & Smartxx users :p

As usual this is a work in progress - we think we nailed all bugs this
time but someone will find something somewhere ;)

Enjoy yet another fine Xecuter Bios Release.

Thanks to Nghtshd & Klutsh for their work on X2 config apps - check them out !

>> Changelog

[5032]
- added: if ini file becomes corrupt (resulting in dvd boot filename to be empty) then this value is reset to "default.xbe"
- added: if nothing could be booted (no dvd and no dash) then an XBE called "rescue.xbe" is run from DVD drive, 
  so, if nothing else boots, THIS XBE WILL BOOT !! :)
-  note: So just in case the ini file gets fucked up and the xbe boot name gets erased/whatever, then it's reset to 
   "default.xbe" so you'll be able to boot evoXdash or whatever.... (if disableCdromBoot is switched off)
   If you switch on the disableCdromBoot setting and got no frigging single working dash on your harddrive then the 
   system now does a fallback boot and tries to boot "rescue.xbe" from dvd - so this will ALWAYS enable you to boot 
   an avalaunch/evoxdash/whatever from dvd to fix your ini!

[5031]
- fixed: x2logo.bmp display bugs solved
- fixed: the wild rings game was not booting again ... fixed now (this game blows)
- fixed: made dash pathes a litte more tolerable, drive character is no longer case sensitive
-  note: LedColor also supports other values than the ones listed - check out nghtshd's x2ool for more versatile led modes!

[5030 BETA]
- added: now can add full paths to dashboards in x2config.ini (e.g. c:dashesevoxevoxdash.xbe), 255 chars max here
- added: x2config.ini now first searched on F: and, if not found, on E: - if again not found then defaults are used
- added: dvd boot xbe filename can be changed now, 16 chars max for this setting - change boot xbe to e.g. "boot.xbe"
- fixed: fan speed setting
- fixed: eject led color settings
- fixed: x logo colors
- fixed: wireframe flubber setting
-  note: if you have no .ini on hdd then the bios runs in default mode and default mode is NO DEBUG therefore it won't 
         boot to xshell even if xdk installed!
-  note: setting "xLogoBackgroundColor" is for x logo background only - no setting for flubber scene bg color (yet)
-  note: always use the latest (included) .ini file!

[5029 INTERNAL]
- fixed: incorrect detection of lba48 parameters if bios not flashed to bank 0
- fixed: all games should boot again (quite handy workaround)
- fixed: default settings (e.g. wrong colors) working again if no .ini file present

[5028 GOLD]
- fixed: fan no longer defaults to 0 when no .ini found
- fixed: led color defaults now to green when no .ini found

[5027 BETA - NON PUBLIC]
- fixed: halo/halo2 now booting again
- fixed: no longer interferes with x3 mods (eeprom stored settings)
- fixed: now loads x2logo.bmp from E: instead of x3logo.bmp :)
- fixed: now correctly describes boot partitions in x2config.ini
- fixed: wild rings (jap) now boots - fixed some weird (and rare!) bug that fucked up the first section header of an XBE
- added: partition table on disk is now used if found on hdd (auto-detection, .ini parameter removed)
- added: hdd partitioning mode can be set by setting byte 0x1b04 in bios.bin (get possible values from lba48.txt file)

>> Notes


You should be made aware of some issues that we discovered and
has probably had some of you tearing your hair out.

If you have games like GTA, GTA Vice City and Fifa 2004 etc and 
they are crashing during the game then you will find they operate 
and AUTOSAVE check which uses your system clock. Now if your system 
clock is corrupt then it will crash a number of titles which use 
AUTOSAVE. One clock we found corrupt had a date/time setting of
15/11/8097. The second the clock was fixed in the MS Dash all the 
games that crashed worked just fine with no problems whatsoever.

You should also be aware that some apps especially FlashX v1.2 are
also crashing - this is down to the EVOX IGR / TSR. You should disable 
all EVOX IGR / TSR and this will get things moving nicely.

Also in case you didn't know X2 Bios Manager v2.3 was also released.
It's now extremely reliable and supports flashing both the Lite and 
Pro X2 mods. It even has a new Internet Updatable MD5 bios listing.
Another extra is to be able to flash the X2 pro using a lite programmer 
if you ever needed to. Get it from here:
