,TzA2000,2005-04-24T12:57Z,"I got that Problem that I can't increase taxes, too...
And the game is crashing randomly every few minutes."
,kanetsb,2005-04-24T13:06Z,"Yup, protection was NOT removed. :) However.... The Clone version of the game works perfectly after patching with this patch and burning the second CD with alcohol in securom 5.x mode. And... don't use that anti-blaxx program... It activates the hidden protection schemes too. :( [but it's not needed anyway...]"
,jonas_j,2005-04-24T18:42Z,"this worked fine with me.... can increase taxes....havent tried it in the turitol, but the thing is that it only needs to work in the real game :P"
,CornCake03,2005-04-24T21:37Z,"Game worked perfectly until I tried this.  I'm able to get in the game and start the Campaign mode for a few minutes but I end up crashing to desktop anywhere from 2-5 minutes after I start.

Not worth it, in my case."
,Elkoremarr,2005-04-25T17:46Z,"My game crach from 2 to 8 mins of play.
anyone hav some help ?"
,CornCake03,2005-04-26T23:49Z,"I said it worked perfectly before I tried this crack.  I was using the instructions per the cloned CD torrent before I tried this crack and the game ran fine.

After I used this, the game crashes within 5 minutes.  I went back to the original way (using Alochol 120% along with the play CD) and it works fine again."
