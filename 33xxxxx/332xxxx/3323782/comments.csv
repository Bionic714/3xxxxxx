And, I hope you don't mind, but I would like to encourage everyone that enjoys your releases, to support the newly created ""Asian DVD Club"" at http://adc.graffitiforum.se/. I'm in no way related to them, but as it seems a great idea, I thought I could help them this way.

Well, thanks a lot for ""Face"" ;)"
