,JaxKx,2005-05-04T08:19Z,"I disagree, I thought it was just as great as the book. If you see it before reading the book you will probably be like what the hell? the whole time. Great movie:)"

,rumba.mamba,2005-05-04T13:50Z,what codec do you need to play these mpeg files?
,betelgeuze,2005-05-04T19:58Z,How is it compared to the other torrent here on TPB. Is this a CAM with mono sound too? I se that it is 50% larger.
,tsuskasa,2005-05-04T21:29Z,"alright video, horrible quality audio!! the audio seems like its only using the center channel, in other words, you cannot hear reverbs, and there eis no direction on audio, left or right.... this also cuts out a lot of the music, so it sounds really, really, weird."
,ztealth,2005-05-05T17:13Z,"guys.. seriously!
it's a screener not a dvd rip!
what the hell do you expect from a screener?! awsome quality with great sound?!
just watch the movie and if you like it you download the dvd rip when it comes..
now stop whining and start watching!
thanks for the torrent mate! :)"
,Fenrisfil,2005-05-05T20:34Z,"Actually I read the book and thoroughly enjoyed this.

There is a lot of additional material, but bare in mind that Douglas Adams did write the origional screenplay prior to his death, so it is like official extra Hitchhikers Guide story. It is very much in the theme and works well. 

But if you are looking for the film to create a perfect and exact representation of how you imagined the book, you will be dissapointed.

I'd actually say though that being a fan of the old TV series will damage your enjoyment of this more then the book because the characters are played very differently (and you even notice things like the difference in the way they phrase classic sentances). As a result, for me it was the newer material that was the highlight for me, not the stuff directly from the book."
,dark-mush,2005-05-05T23:53Z,är det bara jag som har en ful jävla idiot ikon som dansar runt på skärmen när jag försöker njuta av filmen??
,dark-mush,2005-05-06T00:37Z,"fixat, sry trodde det var filmens fel- :("
,Megabyte,2005-05-07T17:19Z,"De två RAR-filerna innehåller BIN/CUE, men varken ISOBuster, Nero eller Cdrwin lyckas skapa läsbara skivor av dem. Hur har ni andra gjort?"
,S.Crockett,2005-05-08T01:06Z,"Hur titta man på filmen på datorn?? Jag har installerat alla codecs jag hittat, men inget funkar!!"

,NickeSwed,2005-05-18T22:07Z,Hur fan ska man se den här filmen egentligen?
,farscape2,2005-05-31T00:04Z,"this is one of those few movies that you DO like when you've read the book. it's got the same weird sense of humour that a lot ppl wont get that havent read the book. this is due to the fact that Adams wrote the screenplay before his untimely death, it just took way to long for someone to make it into a proper movie. wonderful cast as well. great rip superb this stuff"
,Hughj,2005-06-27T00:39Z,"Sorry folks - I'm a numbskull newbie to this! Can anyone tell me how I can view this download? Should I burn the contents to CD, or can I convert it / view it directly (preferred). Please advise correct tools to use."
