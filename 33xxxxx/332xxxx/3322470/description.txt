SCREEN SHOTS:

I downloaded this show from unixpunx when it was up last year, it was in a folder called "NOFX - Live in Madrid 03". The set-list IMO is great, a lot of good new songs too.

Quality: The video quality is "OK", it was filmed towards the back of the crowd, in some places it's very joggy (but you can't blame the filmer, he was getting pushed around a bit too!)

Sound Quality: The sound quality is pretty damn good IMO, although I don't have many bootleg films I may be mistaken.


I have uploaded the song Idiot Son Of An Asshole to my server, so you can see what the quality is like before you download! I wont be deleting the link for a while, however grab it while you can.

The show is pretty funny, it's what you expect from these guys, as I say the set-list is also great.. which moves me on to my next thing.
