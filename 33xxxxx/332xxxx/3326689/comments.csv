,jeebee,2005-05-06T22:39Z,"he new? if dl okay it'l be supernice, thnx"
[T],westart2,2005-05-07T05:45Z,Now seeds any more :( 
[T],Peterq,2005-05-07T11:09Z,"This is some kind of pre-release or similar. I downloaded and extracted it only to find that the total file size is well short of the Illustrator CS2 on CD3 of the suite - the data1.cab is 50Mb smaller! What we need is a full ISO with autorun and original menus etc! I've deleted the file as I wouldn't want people to waste bandwidth on rubbish!

Peter"
,Jax,2005-05-07T15:39Z,Then upload your version peter you twat
,GarfieldLC,2005-05-10T07:51Z,why is this seeding but not downloading ?
,saytensays,2005-05-25T01:57Z,"well peterg, if you do a little research before dloading things.... like maybe if you read the nfo file.... you would have known this is a rip... *shakes head*
the nfo CLEARLY states:
""NOTE: 
Samples and Templates are ripped off, if you need
them - go grab release from TDA."""
,Orestes,2005-05-29T09:31Z,what is TDA?
,dibl,2005-06-04T22:06Z,Still tracker error after 30 min
,sifally,2005-06-23T04:06Z,Ive tried the ssg keygen from several different sources (this one included) and it hasnt worked (on cs2 v12). 
,sifally,2005-06-23T04:11Z,d'oh falso alarm
,andrewmacc,2005-07-05T00:32Z,"Okay, I'm new at this. I've unrar'ed the files, unzipped Data1, and now all I have is hundreds of files with no visible means of executing/installing Illustrator. What the hell do I do?"
,andrewmacc,2005-07-05T00:33Z,Woah. Sorry. It commented three times...
,shaquatch,2005-07-13T02:24Z,sifally: This keygen in this release works perfectly for me all you have to do is follow the directions in the nfo. Remember that you do not use the hyphens when it generates a serial.On the activation side the number you use does include the hyphens.
,Blowtart,2005-07-14T14:43Z,"Installation:

Upon Unraring the main program (not ""keygen.rar""), you should see five (5) files:

0x0409.ini
Abcpy.ini
Adobe Illustrator CS2.csa
Adobe Illustrator CS2.msi
Data1.cab

Right-click on ""Adobe Illustrator CS2.msi"" and in the context menu choose ""Install"".

The rest should be simple.

Use the keygen in ""keygen.rar"" to get your serial and activation code.

PS:  Just to be on the safe side, make sure you disconnect your internet connection before running the program, so there is absolutley no way Illustrator can communicate with it's servers, especially during the moment you enter the serial and activation code.  It may not be necessary to disconnect, but just do it for safety reasons."
,Ceno,2005-08-03T16:56Z,"Does people still get this to work? I DLed it twice now amd gets a error mess quite early when tryin to install it:

1st time I created CD image using ISO which I believe is what caused corruption sometime during burning process."
