Just FYI"
[V],cezen,2007-12-19T15:45Z,"This Software is excellent!  Easy to use.  Just mount to harddrive using ultra iso 8 (or something like it)  Then double click to open files and then double click on program icon (skull/head facing toward left).  This is easy to use, and very informative.  It is useful for any age and we are using it in our homeschool.  If you were studying to be a doctor it would also be perfect for rote memorization.  If you are looking for frills or 3D this is NOT the program for you.  It is simply an online version of an anatomy book, very colorful and the complete human body and all it's systems.  The program has a file for MAC users, but not sure if it is useable on a Mac as I have only PC, but is written for windows and works perfectly with XP SP2.  Good upload Dr Dave."
