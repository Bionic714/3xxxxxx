,mezpin,2005-05-08T23:46Z,"The audio is out of sync.  Good news is the video lag is constant.   You can use VirtualDub to delay the audio ~400ms and it solves the problem.

BTW-Not to be a jerk, but I'm not here to teach anyone how to use VirtualDub.  Just a suggestion for people in the know."
,ja-janse,2005-05-09T02:43Z,"Uhm, would you care to write a small tutorial on that? I've virtualdub, but I don't get it to work.. :/"
,zasabi9,2005-05-09T10:28Z,Helt underbart avsnitt! Nu väntar vi bara på epsiode 09 =)
,eeken,2005-05-09T11:02Z,"nice upload, och som flera sagt, nu ere bara 9an som fattas!"
,jessve,2005-05-09T18:16Z,"Hjälp!!!
Är det bara jag som kommer till 99,99% och sedan hoppar den ner till 99,97% hela tiden som i en loop? Vad kan vara fel? Någon som vet? Vill så gärna få ner filen. För övrigt håller jag med tidigare kommentarer om att nu saknas bara 9:an."
,DankeJ,2005-05-09T18:23Z,"Nice, nån som kan lägga upp episode 9??"
,Pitchshifter,2005-05-10T00:50Z,Does anyone have WPT s03e09? Plzz
,ja-janse,2005-05-10T18:03Z,"HOW TO FIX THE SOUND DESYNC:

Download mediaplayerclassic and you will find an audiosetting - type in 400ms and its fine :)"
,Winnson,2005-05-10T18:38Z,"You can try to download VirtualDub and figure it out, but I just watched it and the sound being out of synch didn't really matter.   You notice it at the beginning but once the playing starts you only notice it once in a while.

That was one of the most amazing games ever!  Man, poker's awesome to watch!  A great, big, huge thanks to the people that put this up!  

Again, big thanks!

,njligernj,2005-05-10T19:28Z,"Thanks again. This was indeed a fantastic show.

In a related note, would any kind soul out there feel like capping the NBC Heads-Up Tournament? Please? I believe there are replays on either CNBC or MSNBC and the rest of the schedule on NBC is ...

May 8 from 12-1pm
May 15 from 12-1pm
and the final May 22 from 1-3pm

Would really appreciate it and thanks again for these WPTs. Great stuff. You are the man. WHOOO!

Oh and if the Heads-Up is already out there somewhere and I missed it a link would be great. Thanks."
,partyman,2005-05-20T02:33Z,"Hi all... thanks for the releases.

I need the 9th edition (as many other inhere i suspect) so it would be cool if it came up any time soon - or at lease a notice about it beeing on its way :o)

Thanks in advance.

,matt0t3,2005-06-05T02:55Z,sorry for the double post - I'm used to them showing up at the bottom :)
,matt0t3,2005-06-05T04:12Z,"also, to everyone clamoring for the 9th episode.  It obviously wasn't capped and released, so you'll have to just WAIT.  Maybe they'll get it in re-runs, maybe they won't.  I'm pretty sure there's an episode from last season that STILL hasn't been released."
,bumblebee123,2006-06-07T14:43Z,"for wpt season 4 episode 11 12 13 ,and high stakes poker season 2 ep.1 go to http://dc.flamevault.com:6969/
