,tigurius,2005-04-22T09:56Z,Well....THAT was an informative database...could you fill us in on what the movie is about?
,Echizen2005,2005-04-22T10:37Z,"google? ;)
sometimes I really get tired... I spent my time and money providing movies and all u get is ""uhhh... no info about it..."", "" wrong movie title..."", ""was not worth it""...

I have my brandmark ECHiZEN on all my movies. Take or leave it as it is. U make me really sik requesting all little stuff... I have a private live, too... o.k.? I am not angry but those things are adding to my decision to let other peeps do my job.

,mentilus,2005-04-22T11:30Z,"Just wanted to say that you're an excellent guy, Echizen, and I love your releases. You're a valuable asset to the community.

As a side note, people who have heard about Tokyo Raiders may (correctly) assume that this is a sequel that takes place in South Korea. And Google is your friend, people!"
