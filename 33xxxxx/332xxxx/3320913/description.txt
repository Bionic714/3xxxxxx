A very good album of a Norwegian who plays his way of the famous Jimi Hendrix songs.
The album got very nice ratings from the musicpress when it came out in Norway in 2003.
A must for all of you who like Jimi Hendrix!

-Because of bandwich speed and that real life is the boss, I can only upload
this album until may is coming. 
So others or you must keep it alive if you want it to be downloaded by others later on.
