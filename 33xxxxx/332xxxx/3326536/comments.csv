,krapnek,2005-05-06T17:36Z,No. The 4:th season hasn't been released on DVD yet. 
,Smulan918,2005-05-06T21:10Z,As stated above this is not the DVD-rip it is simply a collection of the HDTV from different locations gathered in one place for your convenience.
,Sybella,2005-06-12T19:27Z,This torrent wouldn't even start for me. There were so many errors that it cancelled itself. :(

,kurnjauh,2008-04-06T15:46Z,"is it me, or part of the whole seasons audio and video don´t match - the voice comes earlier than visual?! that´s not good!"
,minigan,2009-03-16T16:49Z,Please seed?
,FLibbitz,2009-09-02T23:29Z,"So far so good. No errors or anything while downloading.
As for the audio not being in sync; try using VLC-player or another player like it. It gives you the option of tweaking the audio to your liking, so it's in sync with the video. 

Thanks for the upload Smultan"
