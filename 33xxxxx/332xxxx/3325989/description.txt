Players of Hidden Stroke II can look forward to challenging and exciting missions guaranteed to keep the hobby strategist engaged for hours. British, French and Italian forces are equipped for combat. Four new landscapes to battle across, players can engage in close-city combat, countryside engagements and across arid desert wastelands.

Each landscape consists of over 760 different units, over 500 buildings and countless objects. These vary from a small road signs to a huge submarine riding at anchor. New buildings (haystacks, trees, trenches) offer a huge variety of clever hiding places and entrenchments.
