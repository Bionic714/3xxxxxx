[T],naxosking,2006-12-05T09:34Z,"Great Torrent. I will be uploading a Verdi torrent here soon too. My plan is to upload 20 or so of his operas, some with multiple casts and orchestras. This is a great starting point. Price's Aida is ""priceless"" (no pun intended). "

,Makurosu,2010-10-06T21:47Z,"Guys, just so you know.  Most of this is 72kbps and 96kbps.  It sounds okay for such a low bitrate, but I wish I had known this before I started downloading.  Just a heads up."
,thebt1,2010-11-22T05:54Z,thank you very much for this upload!  I really wish there were more torrents of classical music.  this is a fantastic start.
