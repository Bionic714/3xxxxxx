..the suffer the Little Children Is it possible to grieve after watching this movie? If you don't after watching it, you may be required to turn in proof that you still have a human heart.

,sal052,2005-05-15T22:57Z,välgjord men otroligt tung och sorglig... Men man tackar för filmen...
,Mayhemic,2005-07-10T00:47Z,"Helt underbar film, verkligen."
,ronemp1,2006-02-12T08:53Z,"I give this movie a five star rating. like someone said before, very humanlistic... shows a lot of emotions when each character consistantly facing hardships in the environment they live in. Anyone knows where I can get the musicsheet for this soundtrack? the music is by Gontiti. http://www.gontiti.jp/indexe.html"
,zake88,2006-05-15T19:36Z,"Is it DVD shrinked from dvd-9 to 1,37 GB? What are the benefits, besides it's faster to spread? Just thinking: What is a loss of spreading speed compared to the loss of quality."
,tokyowars,2006-12-24T12:20Z,"zake88:  Well one benefit is that it allows people like me to see films that I would otherwise not be able to. 

My connection speed means that while I can download a file like this in two days, a DVD rip takes a week, while a full DVD9 download is not something that I would even begin to attempt. 

Sometimes quality needs to be sacrificed for art."
