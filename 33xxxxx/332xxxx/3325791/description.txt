RELEASE NOTES/DESCRIPTION:
Ten years after the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps, filmmaker Alain Resnais documented the abandoned grounds of Auschwitz and Majdanek. One of the first cinematic reflections on the horrors of the Holocaust, NIGH AND FOG (NUIT ET BROUILLARD) contrasts the stillness of the abandoned camps quiet, emtpy buildings with haunting wartime footage. With NIGHT AND FOG, Resnais investigates the cyclical nature of man's violence toward man and presents the unsettling suggestion that such horrors could come again.

french narration, english subs. some viewers will find archival footage very disturbing.
