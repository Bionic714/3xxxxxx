,g8aso,2008-11-28T11:13Z,"Why is everybody so happy with mediocre low bit rate tracks?
I am amazed at these comments, do you all have hearing difficulties or just lousy speakers etc.?"
,Tukkercr,2008-12-07T00:36Z,"g8aso, what about you getting a decent soundcard?
I filter it just fine with the one i have, costs a bit but then you've got something. Oh, you cant afford that, g8aso? 
And even then if you cant filter it out, this is not about quality, this is about memories and still, i think the quality is decent enough.
Heck, move on you, still a spot left for you underneath that rock.
Great torrent :)"
