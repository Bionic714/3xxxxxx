Nick Park is maybe the greatest animator of kit-characters (not sure if that's the real word). He is the one who made Wallace and Gromit and Chicken Run. Anyway, he also made 2 great movies about how animals live in the zoo's. Interviewing them about their view of life and such. It's very funny.
1 from 1990 and 1 from 2003. I'm seeding both here. THIS one is a collection of different animations also worth having if u like his other stuff.
