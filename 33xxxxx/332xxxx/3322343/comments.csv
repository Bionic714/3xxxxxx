,Kou_li,2009-06-16T16:06Z,"Nothing works because files are out of date, for the executable parts.
For the roms nothing works, and above all this doesn't simulates pinballs but the circuits.
E.G. u can hit on the pinball table specific targets with your keyboard. There is not ball simulation or game simulation at all. If u like to continue this project visit: http://www.irpinball.org/"
