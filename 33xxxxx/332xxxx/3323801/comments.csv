,Mr.Robo,2005-05-06T06:45Z,For me i keep getting files during the second CD install that won't install.  So far its been a .bof and a .bif file.  I think it might just be 2 bad burns in a row though since first CD worked fine...  MegaGames is a good site for no CD cracks and some trainers.

Mr Robo thanks for the serial."
,Brashen,2007-03-19T04:49Z,"animelitakeru It sounds like you have Deamon toolz no? unrar the files then go to deamon....
If not dowload it, Once you have it launch it then right click it, then you will see ""virtual cd/dvd-rom"" go in there and choose ""set number of devices"" and choose 2 then rightclick again and go into virtual ... ... go to first device and choose mount image.
Then go into your unrared file and click the file1 that can be choosen then repeat with second device and file2.
Then go to my comp there you will see the files as a cd/dvd on your cd/dvd drive and from there its just to go on as with a normal game cd.


Hey you people who have the problem were they recuest CD2, I had the same problem first time I tried to launch and it was the wrong launch shortcut. try all your Shogon shurtcuts inside the folder were you installed the game to and im sure you will find the one that works."
,mle1,2007-04-03T20:17Z,"Hi, i have recently installed Shogun. But everytime i try to play it, it saids insert cd. I have used deamontools but it doesnt works. Do you have any crack or what should i do??"

,GetSeeding,2007-08-27T22:59Z,"Koscher, how about explaining this a little clearer? I have installed both CDs 1 and 2. Now it keeps saying insert correct CD but refuses both. Now, I have two other ISO files in the folder at 1kb each but from what I see, they are the same as the other two. What's going on? Why won't this work?"
,GetSeeding,2007-08-27T23:29Z,"Guess it is true with a lot of things in life, you have to do them yourself. Go to http://www.freeinfosociety.com/downloads/nocdcracks/shoguntotalwar-nocd-1_12-ENG.zip?phpMyAdmin=af0f6b4465fe3f904426eaeb3dc0e3fa and download that. It is in German but easy to understand, just point it to your Shogun Total War Folder and install, replace all the files it asks. Only problem is, this game is a buggy piece of crap. Koscher, you suck."

Mounted succesfully using Deamon Tools Pro. Had initial problems using Deamon Toolz Lite, i would mount the 2 .cue files and the install screen would pop up and i'd press install but nothing would happen. 
resolved by installing Deamon Tools Pro. 

Extract the Shogun file to Desktop mount both .cue files onto two seperate virtual drives using Deamon Tools Pro, then simply run the 1st .cue file and click install, setup worked fine and didn't ask for second .cue file.
