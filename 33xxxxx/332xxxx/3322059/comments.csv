,nv96jom,2005-04-27T07:27Z,Its starwars in awesome resolution 1920*1080
,sponken23,2005-04-27T11:01Z,I highly doubt that it is 1080p since there is no HDTV standard for that. More likely it is 1080i.
,nv96jom,2005-04-27T11:07Z,ok look at wmvhd.com theres alot of 1080p content
,sponken23,2005-04-27T12:03Z,"Yeah, but they are not HDTV clips. They are windows media clips."
,the_rooster,2005-04-27T14:08Z,"Windows media player plays hd 1080p or i


You can use media player to encode into hd


so if you can play in media player that doesnt mean its not hd"
,sponken23,2005-04-27T15:07Z,I'm not saying that the clips on wmvhd.com isn't High Definition. I'm just saying that they are not HDTV-rips. HDTV uses MPEG2 as compression and is usually either 1920*1080i or 1280*720p. Since this is a rip from HDTV it has to be one of those resolutions. 1920*1080p isn't part of the HDTV broadcast standard. 
,DavoNogo,2005-04-27T16:29Z,"1080p is one of the 18 formats of the ATSC standard:

but i would like to know what country you're in to get 1080p HDTV..."
,DavoNogo,2005-04-29T11:24Z,what's the name of the channel this was ripped from?
,nv96jom,2005-04-29T12:24Z,"it isnt TV material for sure!!!!! dont know where it came from, stop nagging about if its called HDTV or HD, it doesent say anyware that it came from TV."
,sponken23,2005-04-29T16:00Z,"Well, I have a hard time beliving that it is anything else than a rip from HDTV. I don't know any other source it could come from especially since it is transport stream which to my knowledge only is used in broadcast."
,DavoNogo,2005-05-01T05:52Z,well it's the exact same size as a 1080i rip i have
,nv96jom,2005-05-01T09:49Z,i just watched the movie and couldnt notice the regular interlace pattern as it use to be when its interlaced so i persumed it was progressive...
,DavoNogo,2005-05-01T10:44Z,"it might have something to do with the higher res or the fact that it was shot entirely in digital..

a program such as HDTVtoMPEG2 can usually detect whether a transport stream is interlaced or progressive"
,sponken23,2005-05-02T16:16Z,The reason you don't see any interlacing is because the program you are playing the clip in are doing deinterlacing or reverse 3:2 pulldown.
,trance_rulez,2005-05-08T18:01Z,OMG!!!! :) wtf is this?!??! :/
,cwm9,2005-06-21T02:36Z,"Is this 2.35:1 ratio, or has it been cropped?"
,mlg,2005-07-23T17:44Z,"It is possible to separate an progressive frame into two fields so you can transmit it. The same thing is done by all DVD-players when they output the picture to tv. (As the current tv system only is able to handle interlaced material.)
In short: It is stored as interlaced, put its still progressive."
,gopiratebaygo,2005-08-11T05:34Z,"yes, this movie is cropped for some reason (wish it wasnt) cuz the quality is absolutely breathtaking. this has to a telecine ripped from a professional studio (like hbo) but someone was able to directly get their video file and transfer/rip for themselfs."
,furryanimal,2006-03-02T19:29Z,"BTW, it makes no sense to broadcast in 1080i, as there is no HDTV display which can show interlaced video. All of them need to revert it back to 1080p

sponken23: Telecined is not true interlaced. It can be losslessly reverted back to progresive."
[V],rockdeamon,2006-04-07T12:01Z,"Fantastisk kvalitet! Hur bränner man en DVD av detta? Har försökt med Nero Vision (4.1.0.15), men det hänger sig..."
,knaak,2006-06-11T10:57Z,"awesome quality but the aspect ratio is wrong. Its something like 1.85:1 when it should be 2.35:1 its not an issue for me since I use zoom player but anyways.. It looks great on my more than 100"" screen :) please post more HDTV stuff!"
,knaak,2006-06-11T10:58Z,forgot to say.. just too bad the movie really sucks :)
,bitbuster,2006-06-11T19:21Z,this in fact is a 1080i source ripped from HBO HD!
,EddieZ,2006-06-12T01:48Z,Already got the 720p version. Can't be much better :-)
,xontos,2006-06-12T14:30Z,What about the sound????
,knaak,2006-06-14T17:37Z,the sound is in 5.1 AC3
,Loughtus,2006-06-20T19:06Z,"too bad there´s no sample, i would really like to check out the quality before downloading this BIG file"
,pugwash,2007-03-04T15:16Z,"To clarify the 1080p vs 1080i comments, movies are filmed in 24fps progressive. 1080i is 60fps interlaced, meaning a half-frame every 60th of a second. This means 1080i is 30fps equivalent. If you get a movie, it's silly to use pull-down to get it to 30fps 1080i when all you really want to do is save a bit of bandwidth and play the whole thing at 24fps progressive.

So, while I've not seen this, it's most likely 1080p as stated by the ripper."
,phullscreen,2007-04-18T05:02Z,"Can anybody tell me how to play or view
this file on a Mac?

Thank you!"
