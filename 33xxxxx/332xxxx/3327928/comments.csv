,jenotron,2006-06-24T05:32Z,this was poor stuff.
,exapplerep,2006-11-25T07:05Z,Thanks! Saw this film in the theatre when it first was released. Every bit as good as the book.
,siwedgewood,2008-07-11T06:56Z,BETTER than the book!
,tonetrippen,2008-11-01T10:10Z,"Hi.

I've down loaded it but get no video. Only audio. I have installed all kinds of codecs and all my other film downloads work. This one does not. It might be a waste of time as it might have been for me, unless someone can shed some light on the no video.

Any help would be appreciated as this one seems to be the only one available at a 
resonable memory size.

thanks

Afterward, it will run fine."
