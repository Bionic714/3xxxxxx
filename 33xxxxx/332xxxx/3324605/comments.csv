,AssMaster,2006-02-14T01:21Z,"Yeah, Christina Scabbia is one hot metal chick! Actually, I'm a little surprised that this torrent still is alive =) Don't miss out on their new album when it's released in april or so :)"
,Em3rald,2006-06-17T05:12Z,"{Drool} that chick is hot.  Haha, she was even in ... Maxim?  Or was it FHM?  Whatever, she's hot and her music is cool.

Here's another band with a KINDA similar sorta sound (I've posted this elsewhere cuz I was uploading a torrent of theirs).  The band is called Anxiety of Influence and they are allowing free downloading of their 4 track demo (www.anxietyofinfluence.ca).

Anyway, that's it.  check 'em out, I promise you won't be sorry.  You can listen to their stuff while you wait for Lacuna Coil to download ;)"
,Nikko2,2006-06-19T20:17Z,"DonÂ´t call Lacuna Coil for Gothic! ItÂ´s Gothic METAL, thats a BIG difference."

,lvytn,2008-12-01T17:18Z,"AssMaster: don't call 192 kbps a ""great quality"" plz... and from now on rip them in 320 thx"

,mparouta,2009-02-11T19:13Z,Very cool !! Nice quality too.. I will seed 'em
,AssMaster,2009-02-25T22:10Z,"For everyone who's complaining or making requests: this is scene releases, and rather old ones from back in the days when 192 kbps were standard for mp3 rips. I haven't ripped these, and don't own all the albums so a FLAC collection won't be coming from me. Enjoy anyway! Surprised to see this torrent is alive even after almost 4 years!"
,KkokiI,2009-06-24T23:20Z,"Anyone else having a problem downloading....mine won't connect, it keeps ""searching for people with this file"""

,amiais,2009-10-25T21:54Z,Moonspell is better.
