Lacuna Coil Discography

Info:

With the debut of their self-titled 1998 EP, Lacuna Coil turned a lot of head in Italy's ambient/ goth scene thanks in part to Cristina Scabbia's haunting, but mesmerizing vocals. Additional recognition was followed after a European tour with Moonspell and later with The Gathering and Seigmen. With the rest of Lacuna Coil's line-up in place -courtesy of Andrea Ferro (male vocals), Cristiano Migliore (guitars), Marco Coti Zelati (bass) and Cristiano Mozzati (drums)-the bands first full-length In A Reverie was issued in 1999. Unleashed Memories followed in spring 2001. ~ Mike DaRonco, All Music Guide
