With the addition of former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr, The The attempted their most ambitious album yet with Mind Bomb. Instead of the darkly polished dance-pop stylings of Infected, Mind Bomb opens up the music to reveal a slow, winding textured world of sound that celebrates its rough edges instead of hiding them. It's serious, dance-influenced rock of the highest order.
