This is a far superior product to anything I have seen out there. I could find no faults with it and I enjoyed using it quite a bit. 

Handy Backupâ„¢ is an easy-to-use program designed for an automatic backup of your critical data virtually to any type of storage media including CD-RW devices and remote FTP servers. You can use Handy Backup to make a reserve copy of any valuable data on your system. Special addons are provided to facilitate the backup of MS Outlook, system registry and ICQ files. Restoring is as easy as clicking a button, but you can also use a number of advanced options. The program can be also used to synchronize files between two computers on a network. 

If you like this program DON'T BUY it from www.handybackup.net, on this site a russian &quot;company&quot; is selling a pirate copy of the real sofware. Buy it the software at www.handybackup.com if you like it. 

This is a copy of the russian pirate sofware and has all the plugins. I couldn't find a crack for the .com sofware.
