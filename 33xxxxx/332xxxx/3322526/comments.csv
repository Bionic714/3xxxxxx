This is my first try so I guess I have to learn from someone..."

""Transferring the copyright on May 29, 2003

Novosoft Inc. (Austin, TX, USA) through its officially registered Branch in Novosibirsk, Russia, has transferred the copyright for the software program ""Handy Backup"" to NOVOSOFT LLC on May 29, 2003.""

Also the date of the transfer almost matches with the date of the last version on the .com-site.

So if you want to but this software I suggest doing it from the russian site, since the version on the .com-site is 3 years old and lacks a lot of the useful functionalities.

Peace out."
