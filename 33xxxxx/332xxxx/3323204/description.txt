Pink Floyd - Live at Kralingen (1970) Holland

A video shot at the Kralingen Pop Festival at Kralingen Bos., Rotterdam, Holland in June  1970. Features Pink Floyd performing Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun and A  Saucerful of Secrets. 

The video is taken from a VHS entitled Stamping Ground, directed by Jason Pohland and  George Sluizer. The video included other bands from the era, as well.  Only the Pink Floyd  portion is presented here, and includes an instrumental jam of Set the Controls for the  Heart of the Sun and part 4 of A Saucerful of Secrets.

Very interesting for fans of post-Syd/pre-DSOTM Floyd - Vintage Space Rock!
