,Humdrum,2005-04-26T02:03Z,"Um, the 5th Season of Futurama was only leftover episodes from 3+4 that hadn't been shown because Fox are a**holes. Only 4 seasons were actually produced, hence only 4 season DVDs... Sorry to be picky"

,martinbodda,2005-04-26T23:58Z,swedish subs maybe??the prewiously posted links didnt work!
,jazzzz,2005-04-27T05:44Z,Yeah I didn't grab the subs due to the first copy only being in english and posted in the United States.  The quality isn't the greatest due to the deinterlaced (non-deinterlaced maybe) factor.  There are probably better encodes of the episode by now.
,bennieblue,2005-04-27T11:05Z,"FAn vad bra avsnitt""!   riktigt roligt! "
