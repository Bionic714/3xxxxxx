What the * does webrip mean anyway?"
,Chicago,2005-05-04T19:42Z,haha.. lol... it means that it was ripped from streaming media on the web(low quality)...
,Godskalken,2005-05-04T19:55Z,"I assumed that was it. I just mean, if they put it out here in 192kbps it was probably streamed like that and not in low quality right? Otherwise, why bother converting it up with no gain in quality?"
,Godskalken,2005-05-04T20:06Z,"Well, the webrip version was absolute crap, but there's something not quite right about this one too. Try comparing the sound on this one to the version of B.Y.O.B released earlier, and you'll see what I mean.
BTW  the tags are incorrect. The correct title is MEZMERIZE (two z's), not mesmerize."
,Chicago,2005-05-04T20:07Z,"well.. if i say like this, ""webrip"" is misleading, u sould rather say like record... becous the source maby is verry low quality but u record in 192kbps.. u get it? "
,changed,2005-05-04T20:09Z,sorry for doubting you sv3a.... Good work man! Keep it up!
,tesseswe,2005-05-04T20:14Z,holy shit..u know what? U just made my day! holy shit this album is so album...damn  thought It would suck...but OMFG this is good...
,tesseswe,2005-05-04T20:14Z,this album is so good* not this album is so album haha
,Chicago,2005-05-04T20:15Z,haha..lol
,Godskalken,2005-05-04T20:39Z,"On second thought I think there's nothing wrong with the sound, but rather with my setup. When playing B.Y.O.B through WMP or winamp I get peaks no higher than about -10 dB, while on media player classic the peaks are 0 dB (which I assume is much more natural if the album is mastered). Anyone know of this problem, or if there is a solution?"
,tommten,2005-05-04T20:39Z,Inget problem med kvaliten tycker jag inte. J채kligt bra album iaf :D Soad 채ger
,Myusername,2005-05-04T23:37Z,The songs sound good quality-wise but are quiet compared to ALL my other mp3s.
,changed,2005-05-05T01:26Z,"can't we all just conclude with the fact.... Sv3a rules.. yeah.. i know im drunk, but still.. System of a down rocks... just listen to Violent pornography... maaaaan!! 
this means the world to me sv3a.. thax :P =) "
