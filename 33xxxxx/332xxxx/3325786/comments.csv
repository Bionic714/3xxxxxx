,jj_moxy,2005-05-05T03:25Z,That is strange.. I'm using BitComet as a client.
,jj_moxy,2005-05-05T03:32Z,But it's not.. it's just the avi.  I think I'll have to check the torrent file.
,jj_moxy,2005-05-05T04:00Z,"Does anyone else see it as an exe?  I'd like to know 'cause I was gonna post the Sara Jay also, but not if this one's not working.  Can someone please respond..."
