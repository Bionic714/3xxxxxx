No trouble extracting the image from the zip file."

Ya should have no probs. then"
,Grumpy_SWE,2005-05-07T02:20Z,"Tried mounting it with the newest daemon tools and Alcohol 120, still gets the same error: crc in data2.cab
The zip file is ok, and the iso file is ok but the data2.cab is the only file that is damaged.
I havent had any trouble mounting other games.
So it must be some weird stuff about that data2 file."
