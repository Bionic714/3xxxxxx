Pink Floyd - In London 1966-1967

Recorded at Sound Techniques, London, England on January 11 & 12, 1967.
This live recording provides a fascinating glimpse into the inner workings of one of the  most innovative ensembles in rock history. There's a CD-ROM featuring a live video of Syd  Barrett-era Floyd performing its barnstorming signature tune, Interstellar Overdrive, as  well as some additional period footage of the '60s Swinging London scene in which the  group was immersed. The audio disc also features Interstellar Overdrive as well as another  extended instrumental piece called Nick's Boogie. 

It's important to remember that at the time of this performance--January 1967--the  psychedelic revolution was still in its embryonic state, and progressive rock was years  away. This makes what Floyd was doing all the more groundbreaking. Both pieces included here are epic-length improvisatory pieces that shift from spacy ambience to full-blown freakout  and back again, using very basic tools. Synthesizers hadn't come on the scene yet, so Rick  Wright relies strictly on his snake-charmer organ riffs to enhance the spooky, ethereal  mood. Barrett utilizes pure, acid-drenched weirdness to make the most unearthly sounds  possible with very little electronic enhancement. Legions of groups would take their cue  from the advances made by Pink Floyd during this time, and IN LONDON makes it easy to see  why.
