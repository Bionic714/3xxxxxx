,Xaster,2005-04-28T19:24Z,I have been playing Tibia for some time before then i found out how stupid it really is....when noobs marries each others and stuffs like that.....so probably this movie is about some real Tibia noobs that have played tibia for too long time ;) well i feel like i really must get this :P
,Damorte,2005-05-12T16:37Z,"It is a parody of the game ""Tibia"" and only one of the actors in the movie has actually played tibia. I would know since im one of the creators of that movie ;)"
