,befb,2005-04-29T13:52Z,"Yes, sorry, I meant DivX, not XviD. The movie is 138 minutes long but keep in mind there is a whole lot of black in this film so the quality is surprisingly good, considering the 658mb file size."

[T],XeroxAlto,2010-01-09T19:18Z,"I couldn't get any audio on my standalone Pioneer DVD player via USB. 

I re-encoded using AVI-recomp to make it watchable via my DVD player. (I have never had this problem before.) 

Something is up with this file. You get something that comes up if you try to play with VLC too. 

Thanks for sharing! :D Remember, sharing is caring! "
