,kitire,2007-05-03T00:06Z,"Okay, heres what you do.

First off, go to your torrent folder/crack/xxx.exe copy and paste it into 
C:\Program Files\particleIllusion_3 or wherever the hell your folder is.

Click on the exe, and it gives you an error, click ok, then go to torrent folder and click on the ""Libraries (before reorganizing"" folder.

You should be good to go :)"

,AMD freak,2007-07-30T05:27Z,"You n00bs need to read all .nfo and comments about a torrent before you dload it or ask repetitive (stupid) questions. 99% of the time there is .nfo and instructions included in the dload.
If you can't read then have your mommy read it to you before she tucks you into bed. lmfao

,AMD freak,2008-06-13T13:11Z,"Got Emitters?  lol

This program is killa and so simple to use.
Also system requirements are very minimal.

Win 98/NT 4/2000/XP (Vista???)
1.8 GHz CPU
256 MB RAM
1024x768 64MB video card
with OpenGL support

Here is a link to some cool 100% FREE apps. (particleView and Gloodle) from wondertouch company website:

http://www.wondertouch.com/gloodle.asp

FYI:

- particleView can load the ELC libraries created in Combustion.

- particleIllusion SE emitters also work in Autodesk Combustion.

Vista Users:

Having trouble installing this on Shizta?
You might want to try and run the setup.exe in XP compatability mode 1st then try and install.
Good Luck peeps

Vista noobs only:

1) ""Right Click"" on the setup.exe file and select run this in XP compatability mode.
2) Then try and install it see what happens.

I don't own/have/want Shitzta so I haven't tried this but thought it may help u all. ;)

The Freak has spoken!  lol

Thanx again gurgle

,AnimeDisneyFreak,2012-06-18T01:14Z,"Wonderful download, I've experienced no problems since I've got it! I've been looking for it forever for my movie projects!!!!

Your directions could be better though... it took me a minute to grasp what you meant, and some noobs wouldn't understand - and noobs listen up!!! - that once you copy the crack you have to go to the actual PROGRAM FOLDER of the computer under the particle illusion folder and paste the crack over the ""application"" icon to make it usable after 14 days... thus solving the problem.

Thanks again!"
