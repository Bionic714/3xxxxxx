I need to find it at a better bitrate."
,jumblies,2008-05-04T23:13Z,"IT is probably one of King's best novels, written when he was at the top of his game.  Too bad the movie sucked ass."
,juniperhill57,2008-06-16T02:22Z,Thank you for uploading such an obscure audio book.  Good quality file.  
,limeydivad,2009-12-23T17:16Z,"Many thanks for u/l. Even after all this time
d/l only took 14 mins
Second only to ""Insomnia"" read by Eli Wallack (?spelling)
Never mind quality, which is OK to listen to, feel
the rarity of this audio book."
,riiten,2010-07-18T21:20Z,Not a very good bit rate. It's listenable though if you really want listen to IT.
