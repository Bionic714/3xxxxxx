,MrMackey,2005-05-19T01:04Z,"No cracks needed, just install the game from cd 1. Then extract the patch to the game's ""Data"" folder."

,Vinicius_Gonzo,2006-03-11T23:01Z,"Now i Got it!!!
You extract the 3 .img disks and burn them on 3 CDs."
,Vinicius_Gonzo,2006-04-03T21:59Z,"Nice Game, but too short. I've finished it in 24 hours or less. But without an walkthrough you won't go anywhere!"
,_Mahadeva_,2006-05-06T12:51Z,"Nice game, why did you played with walkthrough? It takes all the fun... :S"
,r4dixL,2006-06-09T00:39Z,"thanx for postin this alot

,Vocor,2007-06-02T05:01Z,"I don't have stairs.
The zombies are going to eat me...
Thanks for the upload!"
,PiratePunk177,2007-06-22T21:37Z,I've downloaded this a few times from a couple different sites and it seems that every time I try to install the game the installation screen freezes with I click on the install game button and the game closes itself. I'm using Daemon Tools to mount the files. Does anyone have a solution to this problem? 
,Verwandlung-,2007-07-08T16:46Z,"hello, does this work in windows xp?

thank you"
,vickei,2007-12-08T18:13Z,"Real and working, thank you!

@Verwandlung-
Yes.
@The rest of you
""readme"" file, motherfucker, do you use it?"
,Turtle9,2008-01-22T02:07Z,"Ok are you sure this works with XP?
Because I am having FREQUENT crashing problems with this game. Of course I click don't report because that never solves the problem. I meet beyond the recommended requirements and I've installed the patch. I am aware that the read me mentioned the freezes but I haven't read anywhere that they are this frequent. The game itself doesn't actually freeze...it just gives me an error message while the game itself is still playing, the music still going and such.  Can anyone help??"
,crazygoat,2008-01-27T14:36Z,"To Turtle9: I have vista and i had the same problem, i think you cannot do anything about that. However, i was able to finish the game even with the crashes, so don't worry about it. Just save often."
,tmxmistico,2008-04-11T02:21Z," if game crash in XP(fatal erors) go to:http://www.adventuregamers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1403 

look at page 1or 2 and u can find u answer"
,ClaireRedfield,2008-05-03T01:28Z,"i've been trying to mount disc1 to my virtual cd rom, but when i go to my sanitarium folder, no image file shows up.
any suggestions?"
,centime,2008-10-12T14:16Z,"Thank you, chrishootu, for this torrent.  No problem with the download or installation, and the game starts just fine.

But... those crashes are so frequent!  Its a great little game, but I am having trouble getting past a certain point because of the crashing.

It is something to do with the cut scenes - okay that is probably obvious, but I thought I'd mention it in case anyone missed that fact - because it always crashed, for me anyway, right after a cut scene.

I *could* put up with the crashes and just play the game, but they have become so frequent that it isn't really possible.

I question whether or not it is even useable with XP - this is from the read-me:

""Windows NT
----------

Operation of Sanitarium under the Windows NT operating system is not supported.""

And since that is what I am running, it makes sense that it would be having buckets of crashing problems, and is rendered virtually unplayable by them.

I have set it up to run in Windows 98 mode, I have tweaked all of the settings I could tweak to make it run smoother, and it just seems like XP will have an enormous problem no matter what.  This, of course, has just been my experience, but if someone else is wondering about it, perhaps this will shed some light.

Not your fault, though, chrishootu, and I do appreciate the torrent :)"
,TheAssimilated,2008-10-22T06:41Z,"#centime

i cant realy say since i havent downloaded it yet.
but theres a couple of ok  windows emulators you could try if the problem is persistant.
i used one to emulate win 95/98 a year or so back and i rarely had problems with old games while using it!

now the thing is i dont remember the name ofc...
ill check it up later today. but realy, i wont promise ill remember it."
,dark_91,2008-10-24T19:16Z,"To avoid crashes use Cpukiller.
I have a 2,2 Ghz (one core) Cpu, and using this program I have slowed down the cpu by 50%. I have also used Win 98/ME compatibility.
And now I'm playing without any crash :)
You can download it here: http://www.cpukiller.com/download.html"
,s963,2008-12-14T01:26Z,great game indeed i hope one day will come SANITARIUM 2..
,stfnsmnc,2008-12-30T11:19Z,"Hi, I just downloaded the game, everything is fine, except the text speed. When I try to talk to someone, the text just flies and I can't read anything. I have Windows XP. Do you guys know how to fix this?"
,emanc,2009-01-08T22:29Z,"I have discovered that someone has uploaded the data from this torrent to medifire. Links here: http://snesorama.us/board/showpost.php?p=300643&postcount=1 I downloaded it from there, rechecked the data, and I am now seeding on this torrent. Do the same and breathe life into this torrent!"
,FuckFCC,2009-09-22T01:16Z,"Haven't tried playing this yet, but I am running Windows XP SP3 currently. Now although it may not be practical for a lot of people, I would imagine that it wouldn't be too difficult to download Windows 98 and install on a seperate partition on your hard drive so you can play this game without the crahes. If I experience the same problems that others have mentioned, then more than likely that's what I will wind up doing. 

Anyway thanks a lot to the uploader!! I remember playing this game somewhere when I was younger and never forgot the feeling and atmosphere that it transmitted. I expect this will be a fun time if everything works out. =)"
,sersemm,2010-10-09T12:29Z,Sanitarium %99.9 Seed please .
,srvt,2010-10-18T11:41Z,is %99.9 enough to open the game?
,ghostwonder,2012-06-03T16:11Z,"Just download a day ago and works just fine all you need to do is rename all the .img files to .iso
and burn them on a cd or dvd, o and by the way find a SAFE iso burner is a bitch!"
