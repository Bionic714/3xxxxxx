,Pundan,2005-05-02T16:01Z,Well how about linking to the site without your own referrer ID in the link? Or how about just not advertising at all?
,Danvig,2005-05-02T16:03Z,the pilot episode was the first one right? :P
,Pundan,2005-05-02T16:15Z,"Yes, the one that was labeled as episode number one is the pilot."
,afro_d,2005-05-02T22:05Z,"This doesn't work for me, any ideas why?"
,klunden,2005-05-03T19:52Z,"Still packed... and not smaller, just more annoying. Rar is redundant over torrent mmkay?

 I'm sticking with the other one, thanks all the same."
