,subarashii,2005-07-11T17:50Z,"I hate this crap, this always happens, whats more frustrating than downloading 95% of 5 gigs and stall because NO ONE SEEDS... fuck!"
,Kikujiro,2005-07-13T07:44Z,"downloaded 774 times and not 1 seeder, that sucks."
,Kikujiro,2005-07-16T02:34Z,"finally, it's moving again.  hopefully I can download the last little bit, so I can seed this."
,Kikujiro,2005-07-25T07:55Z,there's nothing else to say except it's really fucking sad that there is no seed on this.
