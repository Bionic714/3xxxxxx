Vol9
A superb colection of hand crafted textures. Researched and painted 
by 9 artists to include custom bump, specular and alpha maps and as 
all of our previous textures collections they are of course 100% 
seamless. 

These textures are for applying to scenes and characters based around 
ancient tribes and civilisations but could be used in many other 
situations too, modern themed architectural projects for example. 
The textures range from armour, architecture, materials, stone, 
brick and wood, to shields, hieroglyphs, pottery, cave paintings, 
decor and symbols. 
230 Colour texture maps. 

230 Bump maps. 

62 TIFF Files with in-built alpha maps 
. 
62 Alpha (opacity) maps 

46 Specular Maps
