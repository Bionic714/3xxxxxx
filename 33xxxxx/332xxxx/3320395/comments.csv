,winstonwsmith,2005-07-21T20:18Z,I get a broken torrent error.  What is that?
,winstonwsmith,2005-07-21T20:23Z,"Okay, dammit, forget I said anything.  If anyone else has this problem, I was using BitTorrent when I got that message.  I downloaded BitLord and it seems to be working now."

Somebody, reseed please this file!!! Loading has stopped on 99,9 %. Us there 7-8 people and to load remains about 500 kilobytes...
In advance thanks"
[V],maskrosen,2006-11-20T00:43Z,"Thanks for this beautiful upload! But could anybody seed? I am stuck at 99,8%! Thanks!!"
,mimesis,2006-11-26T22:11Z,i am stuck too... it says 1 person is seeding though...weird. 
,prawnshocker,2007-10-29T22:54Z,"Late 2007 and still 99.9%. Of couse, it's only one file that's incomplete so we can enjoy all of the mp3s in there except Stepner/Kirkpatrick's reading of the 2nd violin sonata, track 2 In The Barn and there's even an alternative and complete reading of that elsewhere in the torrent (Ross and Zimdars' version). I'm only slightly miffed that there's a track that's incomplete....several of the items in here are different recordings to the ones in my collection. 
Incidentally, IMHO this is a better Ives site (than charlesives.org) : http://www.musicweb-international.com/Ives/"
,oscargutierrez,2008-01-12T00:29Z,Thank you very much for the share.
,acsmith,2008-08-02T02:50Z,"This is a great collection--but does anyone have the Concord Sonata?  I can't find that anywhere, on any site."
