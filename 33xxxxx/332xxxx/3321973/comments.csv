What should i do to be able to play this movie?

,shnoogie,2006-04-25T23:04Z,Gotta ask... how are you getting these?  I've searched everywhere on how to get HD digital cable channels onto PC.  Are you ripping these off a DVR hard drive?

,atividia,2006-07-22T03:28Z,Anyone else have a copy of the software used to play this movie? The yousendit links all broke.
,atividia,2006-07-22T06:01Z,"Ok, the video loads in an mpeg2-fixed version of VirtualDub that I have (http://fcchandler.home.comcast.net/stable/) so I know the video isn't a fake. I'm trying to see if I can fix the video to work with *normal* mpeg2 players :P"

,alpher,2007-10-10T21:13Z,Or...you could...burn it on one DualLayer DVD-R as a compliant HD DVD-disc...and watch it either on your computer or better yet on your standalone HD DVD-player...using these few (easy) steps ;) http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=705146
,NeverEnuf80,2008-04-26T05:32Z,"if it won't play on quicktime w/o any obscure BS codecs that some geek made in his mom's garage, it's worthless and needs to be deleted from piratebay
it's not like any of this stuff is easier to do or has better quality than a NORMAL codec, especially h264...so you're just getting screwed into downloading some trojan to try to get it to play
that's the only reason someone would use a codec other than h264"
,staticx106,2008-07-16T18:22Z,Hey guys just thought I would share this info with you all. I have had the same trouble playing highres movies and tv shows as well but I found something that works. This solution will allow you to play this file and others like it also files in .mkv format with windows media player of any version. simply download coreAVC professional from TPB also download Combined Community Codec Pack. First install the CCCP pack uncheck all options don't even select the players it comes with only chose the option for integrate with windows media player and the like options on that page. Once you have finished that install coreAVC codec and once its finished go to its configure file (I am using vista so I just search from start menu for it) and select prefered decoder from the list of options and apply. Now you should be able to play these files and all highres files in windows media player or any player that requires a 3rd party codec to play these files. VLC does work but it does not use external codecs it comes built in with the player so no way to upgrade/change them as far as I know. Hope this helped
,staticx106,2008-07-16T18:26Z,Also if you are experiencing no audio with some .mkv files after trying my solution in windowws media player click on the tiny red x that shows up to the left of the file name in the playlist pane. it will tell you you are missing an audio codec for coreAVC called CoreAAC and you can download it for free from the link that windows media player provides.
,Barbarossa_1985,2009-04-22T23:09Z,"come on guys....just dl KMplayer and enjoy this movie and other HD movies!
WMP is crap!"
,evilmonkey99,2010-01-17T22:57Z,"ATTENTION!! This HD MOVIE SWORDFISH doesnt work. I have over 60 bluray 1080p downloaded movies all in the same format as swordfish and they all work except this movie swordfish. I open it up in WMP and it is just lank and i skip around and its all black and no audio. I opened it up in VLC player and it shows a distorted picture of the title screen and doesn't do anything.
this movie is bad. It obviously has errors."
