Halo Eighteen (Versoin Zero) [PATCH]

05 - The Hand That Feeds (Ruff Mix) (better quality version)

I was sent a better version of the Ruff mix shortly after I posted the torrent.  Go figure.  This should fix the quality difference between  Ruff and the rest.

Why Version Zero?  This isn't official.  This was put together so that the With Teeth folder didn't get crapped up with other tracks.
