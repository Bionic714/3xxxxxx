Commonly referred to as Chrono Trigger '99, or the Chrono Trigger PSX OST, this soundtrack was re-released to accompany the game's remake on PlayStation. It contains 21 of the best tracks from the original OST and has 9 arranged songs that play during the game's anime cutscenes. These arranged tracks are definitely the highlight of the album and should please any fan of Chrono Trigger's music. They certainly illustrate the caliber of Mitsuda's musical talent. However, this isn't a complete OST; it's more of a "best selection" of songs from the game itself along with the arranged tracks. Unfortunately, the tracks are also rather short, considering that they're not looped. If you're looking for a full soundtrack to Chrono Trigger, I would recommend picking up the original, 3 CD soundtrack to the SNES game. However, the beautiful, arranged tracks make Chrono Trigger '99 a worthy purchase, an excellent selection of music that should satisfy fans of the game alike.
