noJazz - a slightly provocative name for the eclectic French techno-
groove, nu-fusion jazz group made up of 5 talented musicians.

“It’s jazz, it’s funk, it’s rap, but most of all it swings,” says the BBC.

"swirling, otherworldly fusion of sweaty funk, detached techno and hard
bebop that overflows with sheer exuberance and playful, relentless grooves."

"The band have their own unique style which defies categorization and attracts curiosity. Electro ? Neo-Jazz ? Sci-fi pop ? Post-funk ? Whatever. noJazz epitomizes the future of jazz – and of music in general."

"noJazz: Una combinación perfecta!"
