,Garret Delsa,2007-11-24T15:11Z,"To those stuck at 99% - try using quickpar -google it- it'll allow you to unpack an incomplete rar file.
Considering these are 55 seperate movies, most ought to be complete.

Also, since I myself am stuck at 97%, someone seeding would be nice - I can keep it up for a week myself afterwards."
,blimmo,2008-12-04T23:26Z,"Sure would love some seeding action, been stuck @99.5% for 2 days now"
