,njligernj,2005-05-09T00:08Z,Holy crap this is awesome. 73?!?! Insanity! Thanks so much. You're the man. Been looking for the old WSOP's for a LOOONG time -- like before the poker boom when I'd have to get crappy VCR dubs off people on RGP. And that was just to get 90's WSOP. Thanks again! Awesome up.
