,zaptorrent,2005-05-10T23:02Z,"Well, you're probably thinking about Transformers Generation 1 and this is not it. I think this version of the series is from late 90's/early 00's. If you liked that one you'll probably like this one too though. Some of the characters are still the same, Optimus Prime, Megatron and Unicron are all there."
