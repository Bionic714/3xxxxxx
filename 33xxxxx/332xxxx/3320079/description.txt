Game info:

    It has been said that the only people in the world who truly understand 
    Marines are Marines and the enemy. And now - you. 
    
    Close Combat: First to Fight represents modern urban combat with unprecedented 
    authenticity. It is a first-person shooter in which you lead a four-man fire team 
    of United States Marines through the perils of urban combat in the Middle East. 

    At every step in Close Combat: First to Fightâ€™s development, active-duty Marines, 
    fresh from firefights in the Middle East, were there to tell us exactly how they 
    do it: How they move.How they talk. The tactics they employ. What it sounds like 
    to be in a firefight and much more! 

    The result is a game so real that Close Combat: First to Fight will be used as a 
    training tool by the Marines themselves. Close Combat: First to Fight is as close 
    as you can get on a computer or Xbox to being a Marine fireteam leader in modern 
    urban combat.

    Features: First to Fight is the only first-person shooter that:

    * was developed with the close involvement of active-duty US Marines fresh from 
    combat in the Middle East. 

    * uses authentic Marine urban military doctrine (Ready-Team-Fire-Assist) which 
    governs how Marines manoeuvre through urban environments. 

    * uses the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) to destroy enemies: call for fire 
    and support from Cobra helicopters, mortar, other fireteams, tanks and AAVs. 

    *allows players to use true-to-life urban military tactics and strategies to defeat 
    enemies: lay suppressing fire, flank enemies, separate leaders from enemies, etc. 

    *uses a psychology model that makes the AI behave and react to situations as real 
    people would.
