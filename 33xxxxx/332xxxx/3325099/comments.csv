,ViRuZ.dk,2005-05-03T21:41Z,it dont works really well!!
,ChevyKing,2005-05-03T21:46Z,"I suggest you download ""SamInside"" instead of this homemade crap..."
,mavve,2005-05-03T21:53Z,"You said it doesn't work ... how did u test it ? Im sure you're doing wrong. My 69 old grandpa can run this program, witch cannot be said about SAMInside that requires some computer skills and common knowledge. This program works fine and quick and is made for dummies, if you are a pro just run knoppix or somethin instead of saying its crap ?!"
,BOAN_Orignal,2005-05-03T22:53Z,Hmm..it just might work if the password is in the list...but a proper admin wouldnÂ´t choose a password that simple  ;)
,BOAN_Orignal,2005-05-04T00:29Z,"But peronally I prefere to use Password Kit Enterprise v7.0  ;)

Makes a great boot-cd to change adminpass on WinXP"
,mavve,2005-05-04T02:48Z,"The password may not be in that list but why not make a new one ?!
And if u wanna go through the trouble to download a bootdisk and burn it and la la la why not just through the fukkin pc out the window :)"
