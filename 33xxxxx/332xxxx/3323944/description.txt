Close Combat: First to Fight is as close as you can get on a computer
to being a Marine fireteam leader in modern urban combat! 

Close Combat: First to Fight is an authentic, team-based first-person
shooter created under the direction of active-duty United States Marines    
fresh from the front lines of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. Set in a
modern mid-eastern urban battleground, players lead a four-man Marine 
fireteam through the perils of modern urban combat. Together with the 
United States Marine Corps and Atomic Games, Destineer is creating First
to Fight as a training simulation for use by the Marine Corps

First to Fight is brought to life by a visually advanced 3D engine created 
from the ground up by Destineer. This engine, filled with next-generation
features like volumetric shadows, normal maps, natural skin lighting and 
specularity, promises to give players a first-hand look at the chaos and
terror of modern urban combat.
