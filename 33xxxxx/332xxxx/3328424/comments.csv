,CVonV,2005-05-10T06:58Z,awesome!
,tomeirik2,2005-05-10T13:32Z,"Nice, love real scene-releases :D Been looking for this for a few days now, finally all seasons are available in good quality..."
,k11u,2005-05-10T20:40Z,superseeding don't worry...
,k11u,2005-05-12T20:01Z,"Sorry guys...
Micro$oft Window$ XP got all bad and corrupted and wouldn't start anymore so I had to format. Last time I checked the torrent there were about 90% of pieces being distributed. If someone with  the most amount complete (about 90%) could give me a list of what files he/she is missing I'll try and get those files so we could get the torrent going "
,flatan,2005-05-13T11:40Z,"Well check your messages, should be 2 from me ;) "
,flatan,2005-05-14T07:59Z,"Well I'm not sure what's going on, but I hope k11u can tell us. Have tried to message him 4 times now. His system should be up and running doh, got one cryptic answer back from him. So PLEASE FINISH SEEDING your upload, dead end on 92.6% otherwise."
,tritolo,2005-05-14T09:45Z,"Flatan ""...dead end on 92.6% otherwise.""

Same for me, stuck at 92,6%. =( 

I really hope you can get this torrent to work again k11u. I have all episodes, but this 3rd season in my computer. "
,cmx620,2005-05-14T13:06Z,"Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.
 Please upload this again but one episode at a time instead of a gigantic 7 Gb download that fails after 3 days and 92% =(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((("
,tritolo,2005-05-14T18:37Z,"Works better for me as well. 

96,9% and still going on strong..."
,margarine,2005-05-14T20:22Z,"i don't get this, why's this torrent so super slow? i am getting
constant 3 kb/s. my ratio here hasn't been changed since
yesterday though i downloaded two eps or so, and leeching
this right now and it won't upload anything. the other
torrents were normal, i downloaded like 300mb, and
uploaded like 100mb, usual ratio for my line. really strange,
anyone got a solution for this?"
,yoki,2005-05-14T23:36Z,Thanks k11u and everyone that helped
,cmx620,2005-05-15T00:16Z,"Thank you!
I'm unpacking now and they all seem to work. Also great that they are not in widescreen!"
,cmx620,2005-05-15T00:18Z,I'm seeding 85 Kb/s so dont blame me if its slow.
,k11u,2005-05-16T04:01Z,Oh also btw if those who have finished or are finishing this torrent could maybe bother seeding....
,cmx620,2005-05-16T17:53Z,"I've already downloaded season 1 and 2 DVD-rip so they are out there somewhere. I think the first 3 seasons are the only ones out. About Gilmore Girls, I am a guy and over 25 and I still find the show really fun to watch :) Well, Lorelei is hot, that's my alibi."
,MissMary,2005-06-17T11:42Z,"Hi!
When I try to download this torrent I get the following error message. Does any of you guys know anything about this?

""trouble accessing files - [Errno 24] Too many open files: 'C:\ {search path}\Gilmore.Girls.S03.AC3.DVDRip.XviD-MEDiEVAĂ\Gilmore.Girls.S03E19.AC3.DVDRip.XviD-MEDiEVAL\gilmore.girls.s03e19-med.r04'""

I'm very grateful for any help!"
,MissMary,2005-06-17T11:44Z,PS. Where it says MEDiEVAĂ it should say MEDiAVAL. Clumsy fingers ;o)
,Mephistophelean,2005-06-26T02:33Z,"Thanks big time. Your effort is appreciated, and your seeding is not in vain!"
,jack_ripper,2006-01-06T12:41Z,Pleas seed! I'm stuck at 99.4%! :( Thanks a million!
,jack_ripper,2006-01-06T12:44Z,"And btw, does anybody know where I can find season 2? I can't find it anywhere .."
,Ezz,2006-04-17T15:28Z,"I downloaded all files from S3E1 now, but the audio doesn't match up with the video. At a point there are like 2 different voices crossing eachother. Do more people have this?"
,ammiandersson,2007-05-19T13:38Z,i cant et no sound?? what am i doing wrong?
,rajanithapa,2007-10-07T11:52Z,"please seed, i am stuck at 99.7%!"
,newt2603,2007-10-12T21:57Z,I know it`s been a lot of time... But please somebody help!!! Please seed!
,Hollowman,2007-12-08T10:09Z,Seed please........
,SeedLeechPirate,2008-09-20T14:55Z,"hey just a couple of  thoughts here.

1: Don't rar files like this.. its stupid.
2: Don't put in samples, it makes the file bigger and longer to download and nobody wants them anyway.
3: Nice effort.. better luck on your next upload.. if there will be one."
,Vicontessa,2008-11-21T01:33Z,Please!!!!!!!!!Seed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
