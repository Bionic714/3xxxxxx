Virginia Rodrigues Sol Negro- Fantastic !!	

I heard this album on an old crap quality mp3 disc..

It is such a fantastic album that I have just bought all three Virginia Rodrigues cd's.

If you dont listen to it all then at least check out 
'Negrume da Noite' which is actually track 1 on the album... superb

Album encoded by Nero, VBR top quality.

Virginia Rodrigues - 'Nos' is also uploaded

If you like it buy the disc and support the artist, I got mine here quite cheap..
