Ok...to all of those that say you need two cd's, that is, 1.4 gigs of data for an AC3 soundtrack...THINK AGAIN.  

There is no difference in visual quality between this encoding job, and the dvd source.  Give it a go.  I'm not going to tell you what I did...that's extra special shit.  

BTW, this is Disney's only rated PG cartoon. ; )

I just want everyone to know...there is more to encoding than a high bitrate.

XviD beta 2 with option external ENGLISH subtitles in VOBsub format.

You'll need to install this to hear the audio.

Mini Plot:

Taran is an assistant pigkeeper with boyish dreams of becoming a great warrior. However, he has to put the daydreaming aside when his charge, an oracular pig named Hen Wen, is kidnapped by an evil lord known as the Horned King. The villain hopes Hen will show him the way to The Black Cauldron, which has the power to create a giant army of unstoppable soldiers. With the aid of a stubborn princess, an exaggerating bard, and a pestering creature called Gurgi, Taran will try to save the world of Prydain from the Horned King. As the new friends face witches, elves, magic swords, and the Cauldron itself, Taran starts to learn what being a hero really means and that some things are more important than glory.
