Can someone recommend an ok tracker with a high uptime?"
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-29T23:17Z,"Could someone recommend a server in sweden that has english information about hosting packages?

I already have a tracker written, I just need someplace to put it.

[T],sickboy88,2005-05-18T01:41Z,"ok, I am back.  Had to move.  I've been living out of a hotel for close to a month now.  Going to unpack the rest of my shit, and speedtest the wi-fi I'm stealing as of today."
,pestka,2006-03-27T20:24Z,"could someone seed it? I've got 99,2%"
,clay34,2006-05-02T20:18Z,"Oh pleaaase! Seed! Stuck in 99,2%!"
,clay34,2006-05-17T16:40Z,DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT ! STUCK IN 99.2% FOR A LONG TIME (MANY MONTHS) 
,eathemeek,2006-07-02T00:19Z,I downloaded this and yes it does indeed get to 99.2 % and then stop. Is there anyway to compile what i have. I am using bitcomet and and it creates the full sized file and then seems to slot the data in as it comes in.. so its not like a partial file.. its a full file but with missing data. All .8 percent of it :P. Anyway.. i used to use Kazaa lite ages ago and you could view what you had of incomplete dat files. Is there a way to do this with torrent downloads. Seems a shame as this is one of the best cartoons i have seen and is no longer in any video stores in my town. Thanks for your time.
,eathemeek,2006-07-02T03:27Z,"Ok.. if you are using ""BitComet"", which is what i am using. Once it hits 99.2% you can right click on the file and go ""Preview Video File.."" It then starts up fine. Great quality and i dont think im gonna miss much since its 99.2 percent done :P. Thanks sickboy for the good quality file."
,eathemeek,2006-07-02T12:40Z,"Ok i watched it in preview mode. It stopped around about 10 times :S... each time you have to start the preview again and then position the time slider about 5 seconds past the place where it stuffs out. This gets very annoying as you have to do it before the stop happens or you have to try it again. Would be very handy if one of the 1500 people that successfully downlaoded this bohtered to reconnect for us. Anyway by far the best cartoon i ahve ever seen.. took disney 7 years to make and is the only cartoon they ever created that is not rated ""G"". I now know why they no longer play it on TV as it is about 15 billion times better then anything else they have made since. Now all disney do is sell mobile phones to 6 years olds to give them cancer and buy lots of dirty smelly companys to make money instead of making quality films. They basically now remind me of macdonalds. "
