,tedduz,2006-03-28T12:01Z,"The video is very beautiful for my eyes, but I can't hear the audio!
Is there something I could do?
Do I miss a specific codec?
Or should I also download the only-audio file you are sharing?
Hope you can help to solve the problem.
Thank you!"

I wonder what'll happen when I paste the .wav-files on this mpeg. 
Hope it's going to work because the movie looks promising."
