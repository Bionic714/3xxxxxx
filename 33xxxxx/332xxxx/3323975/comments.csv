,Minerva.TheGift,2007-11-14T22:22Z,"Thanks for the torrent!  After extracting each .rar (one for each volume) everything works great.  I read through the first chapter, and it looks like these are scanlations, not copies of the English version (obviously the upper numbers would have to be since all the volumes aren't out in English yet, but just so you know, the older volumes are also scanlations.)  I've enjoyed reading the English edition of this manga up to around volume 9 and I'm glad I finally found the rest of it.  I'm seeding as we speak :D Thanks again!
