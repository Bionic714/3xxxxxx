,EgoRip,2005-06-12T08:30Z,You are welcome
,Atomicaz,2009-01-29T05:39Z,"Great quality(192kbs),  convoluted extraction though...  "
,SeberHusky,2011-01-19T20:47Z,"Jesus christ!  You don't need to zip the files THAT much!  

For anyone downloading this, in order to get to the songs, you have to:

Extract the main RAR, click a folder, click a folder, extract a set of RAR's, click a folder, then unzip a folder, then click into another folder, then you get the songs.

But it is a good torrent, amazing quality, no viruses."

Thanks though."
,EgoRip,2011-06-28T14:11Z,"Sorry, but in 2005 when this torrent was uploaded I was paranoid. There was different password on all rar files. They were removed when the torrent was uploaded... sekond time :-P 
Nothing I can do about it now."
