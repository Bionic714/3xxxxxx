Yes: Live in Philadelphia 1979
1979’s "Live In Philadelphia" clearly exemplifies the power of Yes’ music. Captured here at the peak of their success with Jon Anderson on vocals, Chris Squire (bass), Alan White (drums), Steve Howe (guitars) and Rick Wakeman (keyboards), this is Yes at what many believe to be their creative best. Prior to several drastic personnel changes in the 1980’s this is the definitive Yes line-up and features some of their most popular pieces including "Starship Trooper" and of course, "Roundabout".
