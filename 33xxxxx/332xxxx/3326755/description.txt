For all you peeps who are stranded at 99.8 % and the rest of you who leeched the previous torrent I uploaded here. 

Grab this baby instead. 

***NOTE*** It is important that you download the torrent / the torrent's destination to exactly the same as previous torrent / folder ***.
 
Or else you'll have to start over again. and you don't want that. 

***HOWEVER***  
You have to replace file .014 in CD5 with the correct file, which also can be found on torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrents-details.php?id=3325870 

If you can see the file extensions on your PC you need to switch that option on, thus allowing you to see them .


So remember, before you start leeching this, get file .014, replace the old one in CD5 and leech away . 

If you get .sfv trouble, you will have to remove the torrent from your client, then remove the .sfv to you recycler and then start up the torrent again in your torrent client. 

voil√° .

hope this fixes it all :)
