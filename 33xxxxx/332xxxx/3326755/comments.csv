,rudolfbay,2005-05-08T09:48Z,"Using Bridge (Browse from til File menu) displays an error:

""Adobe Bridge cannot be used at this time because of licensing restrictions. You must have installed and launched at least one other Adobe application to use Adobe Bridge.""

Does anybody have another version af 'Adobe Bridge 1.0.msi'?

I know from a Danish Blog, that somebody had solved the problem with a new version he got from Adobe Support.

Thanks in advance"
,netpirate,2005-05-08T12:53Z,"Ok I am getting confused here.

I downloaded the other one until I reached 99.9%. Then I downloaded the replace file for CD 5 and replaced it. After that I downloaded the remaining here and reached 100%. So far so good. 

BUT

What I got was not .rar files but 7 CD's with tda's and 1 cue file in each CD containing 0 KB and 1 bin file in each CD containing 0 KB. How am I surposed to install this?  I dont work if I make it to an iso. and nothing else work.  IfI try to mount the cur files I am getting this error:

""Unable to mount image. Cue sheet: No tracks specified""

Furthermore where's the keygen?

Am I missing something here or what's going on?

I would like to think that after seeding 12 gbyte and waiting 36+ hours to finish this download that it would work.

Or maybe I am just not getting the picture?"
,TixUs,2005-05-08T14:43Z,"er det noen som kan sende meg kun keygen p책 mail eller msn, s책 legg til h3nrik_90@hotmail.com

TAKK  :D"
,jmx,2005-05-08T19:47Z,"Thanks for a great seed!
Does anyone have the lockup code for the bonus material on the total training video tutorials?"
,guerilla,2005-05-09T04:03Z,Well that was fairly simple ... thanks for the hard work you guys put into this ;)
,trichome,2005-05-09T08:51Z,"Excellent, everyones jealous I have CS2 allready =P I couldnt do in all in one install but everything installs fine seperately and keygen is right on."
,trichome,2005-05-09T08:55Z,"btw netpirate just use burn disc image on nero. after unrar you should have files labled with a, b, c etc. open each in disc image burning section of nero. piece of cake. or your files are junk if .bins are empty but those 2gbs have to be somewhere"
,jerrythaman,2005-05-09T12:54Z,can I register when i've used the keygen? Otherwise I can only use the program for 30 days....
,gus_no1,2005-05-11T21:23Z,Lovely!
,Star1,2005-05-14T16:15Z,"If ANYONE have the Org.Pack, plz scan and put up the CD Labels/ Covers or if you know where I could find them :)

Tnx"
,evellone,2005-05-17T20:24Z,the site says there are seeders but I just keep getting 'connecting to peer'  do i have to do anything special to get this torrent?
,scully,2005-05-21T11:53Z,"When I install CS 2 - choosing Acrobat, Illustrator and Photoshop only - some serious problems occur:

At first, all is well, but when I reboot my computer and start Photoshop this error message appears:

""Your Adobe Photoshop(r) user name, organization or serial number is missing or invalid. The application cannot continue and must now exit.""

Illustrator closes down during launch.

Acrobat seems to work, though.

What can be done?"
