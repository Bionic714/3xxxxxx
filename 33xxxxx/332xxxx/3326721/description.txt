The voice of Social Distortion

Under The Influences is the second solo album from longtime leadsinger/songwriter for Social Distortion, Mike Ness. Produced by Ness and James Saez, the album showcases a defining genre of music for Ness - primitive rock 'n' roll. He has adapted tunes from many of the artists who have influenced him over his 20-year career and the full track list is made up of his take on songs from some of his longtime favorites.

Not as great as Cheating at solitaire. Covers of Mike Ness biggest influences. But its still a great collection of songs. And as always heÂ´s putting a personal touch to the songs..
