Portugal has always had a strong hardcore tradition as have their neighbours Spain, with bands such as X-Acto forming the base upon which known and respected bands such as Day Of The Dead or Pointing Finger have built. With the release of this new EP and a successful European tour under their belts, Criminal Waste are sure to become a force to be reckoned within a European hardcore scene that is producing better quality bands than ever before.<br />
