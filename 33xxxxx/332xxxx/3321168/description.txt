The newest offering from Israel's own Orphaned Land.  A wonderful metal concept album about the three major monotheistic religions - Islam, Christianity, and Judaism.  This is for fans of progressive metal, ethnic music, or simply anyone who needs some good music to listen to.

After you've downloaded the album, make sure you buy it from the band <A HREF="http://www.orphaned-land.com/content.php?language=en&menu=shop&theme=seven"> here. </A>

Please post any comments you wish me to read in english o espa√±ol.
