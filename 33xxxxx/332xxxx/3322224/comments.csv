,xiIix,2006-11-13T07:41Z,"God damnit. I'm so sick of explaining this to everyone..

YOU CANNOT PLAY HD MOVIES ON A REGULAR DVD PLAYER. STOP ASKING!! 

THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO IS OUTPUT DVI-2-HDMI TO AN HD TELEVISION. IT IS ABSOLUTELY ***POINTLESS*** TO WATCH THESE MOVIES ON ANYTHING BUT A HIGH RESOLUTION MONITOR OR HD TELEVISION!!!!

IF YOU WANT TO PLAY HD MOVIES ON A DISK, GET AN HD-DVD PLAYER OR A BLUE-RAY PLAYER AND BUY THE DAMN MOVIES ON DISK. 

NO, THESE FILES WILL NOT PLAY BACK ON HD-DVD PLAYERS OR BLUE-RAY PLAYERS. IT'S NOT THE RIGHT FORMAT. THE ****ONLY**** WAY TO PLAY THESE ON YOUR TV IS TO OUTPUT THEM FROM YOUR COMPUTER TO YOUR TV."
