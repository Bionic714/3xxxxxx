,adode,2006-10-07T17:16Z,seedar nån fortfarande på denna? :)
,adode,2006-10-07T17:19Z,* is someone seeding this? :)
,adam917,2006-11-30T21:18Z,"I knew one episode was missing, and I wondered which one it is. I haven't gotten up to Season 4 yet, but hope to find that missing episode by that time.

How can I fix the file names to add a space or underscore where it should be (the titles are WrittenLikeThis)?

These are VHS rips from PAL (Netherlands) TV, right? I know some non-subbed ones are actually US versions.

Many of these rips seem to be the Hero versions, that were toned down for UK release (notice lack of Mike's Nunchaku and some people calling the TMNT the Teenage Mutant Turtles (skipping the 'Ninja' word)?).

Thanks a million to whoever released this. It will hold me over till the full DVD series comes out. :-)"

,Sandywichsboy,2009-05-31T17:00Z,"Thanks for the torrent. It's a pity they're hard subbed with Dutch, but it will do.

I have bought the DVDs for season 1-7 but now I can watch the missing eps from season 5 and also season 8-10 to tide me over until those are released on DVD.

Thanks again!"
,Sandywichsboy,2009-05-31T17:05Z,"For anyone wondering, S4 E11 is not included because it simply does not exist at all.

,flexi,2009-07-19T04:17Z,German sub i belive and poor quality
,psychokittie,2010-01-08T20:19Z,"Personally, I love the animation from the 80's a LOT better than the CGI crap of today. I was an 80's child, so I watched the kids movies like MLP, rainbow brite, GI Joe, etc. I've seen the new CGI movies of Care Bears and MLP. Honestly, the animation sucks. The kids today are just used to it, and they don't know any better. The animation used in Flight of the Dragons, and The Hobbit, etc cartoons was awesome. 

Anyway, I do have a question... I have some of the TMNT cartoons on VHS. The first one is called ""Heros in a Half Shell"", about the beginning of how they came and how they met April, etc. I didn't see it listed in these episodes. Mainly because I don't think it was an episode, but an actual full length animated movie. Does anyone know where I can find it on DVD? I'd actually be willing to pay for all the TMNT animated movies. but even amazon doesn't have them.
Any help is appreciated.

,DryYoshi,2011-07-13T12:52Z,"Even though I'm Dutch I don't want to have the subs especially when they're hardcoded. 
I found all the episodes without hardcoded subs on tehparadox.com.
So go there and search for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. There are multiple threads with multiple download hosts so I would suggest to download JDownloader and then copy the RapidShare links into it which don't make you enter a captcha so that you can download overnight. (although you do have to wait a few minutes between every download)

Hoped I helped you guys out."
