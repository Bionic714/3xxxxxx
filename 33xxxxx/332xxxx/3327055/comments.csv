[T],swebarb,2005-05-07T13:44Z,"idiot stop taking credit for groups work and no fucking links to your stupid adware crapsite! 

Will vote 1 and post this in every torrent you upload here you spanish hijo de puta!"
,kami,2005-05-07T19:58Z,pctorrent = a group aiming to always be number two on a release?
,Xarko,2005-05-07T20:09Z,"played the game a few hours, and my review is in short: it totally sucks! it's like a dungeon siege without any fun and with a ""german interface"" (everything feels wrong and stupid, not as bad as gothic's interface but almost)
stay away from it at all costs! if anyone had any fun at all with it, you can PM me and call me a loser and i will PM you back confirming that i suck "
,Xarko,2005-05-08T16:49Z,"i still havn't been pm'd by anyone claiming the game is good nor that i am a loser. seems to me i'm not the only one that hates this game. 
it must feel really awful for the developers that people don't even want their game for free :("
,Angry79,2005-05-08T21:28Z,"Thanks for the warning Xarko, I wonÂ´t download it. :)"
,blaze7,2005-05-08T23:47Z,"pctorrent why unpack and add your lame shite, then your divX 
bumchum does the same, and then your third pal will upload also. Why not upload something good without spam that you haven't downloaded off someone else. But then you'd have to work out how to crack it yourself you stupid fuck!"
[T],pctorrent,2005-05-09T00:54Z,"para todos aquellos hijos de puta que tocais tanto los cojones



POR QUE NO OS VAIS A TOMAR POL CULO!!!! HIJOS DE PUTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"

...and it deserves to be noted that pctorrent's last comment calls anyone complaining ""children of whores"""
,serpientes,2005-05-14T17:03Z,"it is kind of strange, becuse when i started to play this game, a small screen apperad, when i pressed ? it didn't go away like it said on the screen, does somebody know how to fix it"
,mr_danze,2005-05-30T16:53Z,Hey.. Jeg er dansk :D But where and how do you get the crack-file for Dungeon Lords from? :S
,littlebritain,2005-07-14T15:23Z,"this game doesn't work properly, when you enter fargrove and goes into another district you cant go back then the game crashes!!!!
And by the way you cant uninstall the shit."
,Smarmeh,2005-07-19T03:03Z,Yet another torrent for a pulled out of the ass game. Do not download this shit if you want to remain optimisic about fantasy RPG's.
,Joaqii,2006-01-30T19:22Z,... you guys really are a bunch of wankers... 
,TheGrindSith,2006-02-26T19:27Z,"Seeders, give me strength! I summon you!"
,dragon_2369,2006-09-14T17:43Z,Where are the seeders?
