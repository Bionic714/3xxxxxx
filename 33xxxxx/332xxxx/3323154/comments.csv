,omelet,2005-04-30T23:40Z,"it is a great movie, though when I watched this copy of it, the ending is cut off.  Did I miss anything in the last 5 minutes or so?

If so, may I make a request to anyone with the full movie?"
,befb,2005-05-03T21:32Z,"SHIT. there's about one minute of the film that's cut off in the end. sorry about this, guys. you'll be happy to know that there is nothing important in that last minute except that when susan is moved into the police car, joe denies her of help. and that's the end."

The moment helps to set a mood at the end that is really quite powerful.  I recommend passing on this one, instead look for a complete copy a complete version."
,dbdbdbdb,2005-05-15T06:16Z,"Not only are the last 4 minutes of the film missing but this is also a Fullscreen RIP of a movie where a Widescreen DVD is easily available.

Not recommended."
