,mypmack,2005-06-19T15:11Z,Plz seed this.... 
,Jeffers,2005-06-19T23:03Z,I installed the first hoodlum cd1 and cd2 files and then applied the first hoodlum crack. Those didn't work so I got this crack fix and when I try to play the game it still doesn't work. It just brings me to the Stronghold 2 v1.1 window. I click on the play button but right after nothing happens. How may I fix this? Any way? Thanks.
,Dirty_Pretty_Thing,2008-01-24T03:27Z,"hey, i kno im a bit late with this, but will this work for stronghold II Deluxe? is it the same thing?"
