,Distraida,2006-01-21T23:51Z,My virus scanner (Avast) found a zip file (anglosaxon.zip) attached to one of the fonts in this download. I deleted it and would not recommend anyone else download it.

,mindlight,2006-07-03T10:34Z,Use Adobe Type Manager which lets you add / remove fonts in realtime.

I doubt I'll ever need any more.

Thank you."
