,durerca,2005-04-30T04:21Z,Thank you so much for posting this and season 2.  Those are the only two ones I haven't watched of the Amazing Race.  I had downloaded season 3 off of eMule but I couldn't find 1&2 there so thanks again.

First two episodes the quality is ok, kinda looks like someone recorded on a vcr and then transfered it to computer, but the rest of the episodes are great quality. "
