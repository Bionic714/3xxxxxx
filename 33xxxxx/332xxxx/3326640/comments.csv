no need to download this i would say.

without the Booklet, the DVD or the cool box then this really ain't good. well, it's remastered... uhm.

and with this crappy quality? hah...

don't download it, it's only the first 8 albums in CRAPPY quality."

,scorpNZ,2009-01-04T05:11Z,"Quality is average to good,then again what would you expect from some of the early recordings,with a little fine tuning on the stereo it's all good,nice to hear that raw sound unlike the sanitised digital recordings we get these days"
