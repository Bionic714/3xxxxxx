,xxernestoxx,2007-11-22T04:00Z,"Don't use this, not that its a bad torrent infact its really good thanks revarre. The problem is jelsoft and piracyreports.org monitor unauthorized use like hawks. After 6 months they shut down my forum it was either that or a law suit. So you don't have a repeat of what happened to me try something open source. "
,lolzilla,2008-03-30T00:35Z,Why is it that out of all the torrents ReVarre uploaded only 2 are seeded....and each of those two only have 1 seeder....:(
,lolzilla,2008-03-31T00:57Z,"Thanks RevArre, i can confirm it works, i would recommend the old vbulletin though, the beta(this one) kept giving me errors, 3.6.8 l2 is much better

AND SEED - it took forever to download.
I WILL SEED IT THOUGH :)"
