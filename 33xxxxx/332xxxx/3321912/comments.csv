This is an American film so why the fuck is everyone speaking French anyway? Did they change the US Constitution again when I wasn't looking? :)"
,ch1p,2005-04-27T23:30Z,thanks for the headsup :D
,ironleo,2005-08-01T03:40Z,"TO DONKI - Stupid American, Pirate Bay is a swedish site , therefore who cares about that constitution crap ? and then the Fr in the description and comments mean FRENCH you idiot !"
,kamonn,2005-08-05T04:50Z,"Why being so rude?, a simple Fr does not mean French for everyone. Is it so hard to type ""French"" and avoid a lot of trouble?"
