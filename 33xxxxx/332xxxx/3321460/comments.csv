[V],RosaMannen,2005-04-25T19:48Z,i would do it if everyone used bittorrent-clients like them. but not everyone does that. and sometimes i want to describe a certain video and it's quiete hard to do that if everyone is in one file :)

I'm fine with the individual videos.  Combinations would be OK when they're all from a single event like this, or maybe the 60's TV series.  With different artists and shows, it's nicer to have the choice.
