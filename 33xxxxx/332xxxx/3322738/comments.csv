,Zackreaver,2007-06-27T06:09Z,"to gardhau-

It's both, single player mode, and online mode if you have the network attachment for your ps2.  Also you can install the game on your ps2's harddrive if you have one, shortens the loading times by a huge amount."

,ReaLReaM,2012-01-28T00:14Z,"+12 Quality and so little seeders? Guys, please, I ask you dearly to help a friend of this series out and seed - Any seeders will be appreciated, and you shall be blessed! :)

I want this game in NTSC, and this seems to be the most successful torrent - Please guys seed for a friend in South Africa - My internet sucks as is, and the low seeder amount makes it worse...

Thank you elitewebt3 for your excellent torrent, and thank you Piratebay for your great community. Thanks all."
,ReaLReaM,2012-01-28T00:19Z,"BTW - All you guys asking for if its NTSC / PAL - The torrent uploader said ""USA"" so it's safe to assume he is within that region - If you check the wikipedia ""PAL REGION"" you should see that USA is NTSC - so by that logic this should be NTSC.

Also, for you people wondering how to play this on your pc - Go to google and type in ""Pcsx2"" and download the 0.9.8 version (It's the latest atm) - Download this torrent - Load the ISO onto the program and whala! You should have one of the greatest games ever within your playable reach. Enjoy guys, it's a really awesome game."
