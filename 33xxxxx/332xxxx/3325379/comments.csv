,andersson3,2007-03-26T11:50Z,To total training: I actually wanted to order a Illustrator training from you charged to much for the delivery. The cost of delivery was as high as the product... I suggest you to use the same mailer as KurvStudios where I've bought a lot of DVDs... No wonder ppl prefer to distribute it via Internet....
,twelveincher,2007-06-08T09:21Z,Is there anything else we can do? I think this torrent is dead unless peterq starts it again. I dunno.
[V],dohduhdah,2008-02-13T17:59Z,Total training.. please look up the words 'stealing' and 'sharing' in a dictionary because I think you are a bit confused about the meaning of these words.
