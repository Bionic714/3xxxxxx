DVB recording converted to DVD - no recompression, so pure broadcast quality 
Episode 5 - World War Three
Also includes BBC3's episode of confidential, and a menu to choose between them. 

-please note, my recording of the BBC1 show failed, so this is the BBC3 repeat.  Still high quality, but BBC3 broadcasts at a lower bitrate - hence the smaller size.
