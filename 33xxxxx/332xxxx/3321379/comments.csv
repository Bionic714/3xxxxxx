,ianken_ms,2005-04-26T06:52Z,"BBC Confidential is a behind the scenes show with interviews with the cast and crew of the current show as well as interviews with prevoius doctors and companions. 

These DVB sources DVD images are top-notch. They might be bigger than the divx or xvid variant but if you're aiming for quality nothihng beats a direct bit for bit copy of the original BBC digital broadcast. These DVDs are anamorphic widescreen and look great."
,tobio25,2005-04-26T09:42Z,"Just two points to add,
BBC confidential will NOT be appearing in any final retail Dr Who dvds.  they are TV only.  Since the show largely goes over what we just saw, its not so bad.  I am sure the interviews and behind the scenes footage will be included in the other extras on the dvds.  But Dr Who collectors will definately want these.

Also, as pointed out in the release notes at the top, the main episode this week was recorded from BBC3, not BBC1.  What this means to those who aren't expecting it is:

It says BBC3 at the top left of the screen

The quality is still the same, albeit at a slightly lower bitrate.  Anyone who complains about this is politely asked to download a DIVX release of this episode if it bothers you that badly, or even buy the retail dvd...
normal service will be resumed next week."
