,SurealKilla,2007-03-12T15:46Z,you don't need a crack burn it to CD with TOAST.
,forest hunter,2007-05-20T10:49Z,Is this worth the download?
,RomanSPQR,2007-05-30T01:28Z,"This is a good game but if you have an intel mac and the latest OS (10.4.9) this game will crash on you.

There is a patch to make it intel compatible that is in beta right now.  it needs to be simcity 4 deluxe/rush hour tho.  macupdate has it.

this a great game tho."

,aands,2007-07-19T09:05Z,"The above CD-key says invalid but works the second time. After downloading this, be sure to patch this game to version 1.02. In order for it to work, burn the .toast files to CD. 
Open Disk Utility, then go to File > Open Disk Image and select the first .toast file. Then select it at the left column and hit burn. 

Great game. I save my maps to an external HD so I can share them with my PC version of this game. "

Oh dear, you are  NOOB are you not, Sir? Hahaha, I apologise, it's just that I've been using BT for over a decade, didn't realize there's a bunch of you guys trying to learn this stuff. here's a quick summary:

1. Download a BT client (e.g.: for Windows, use: flashget, bittorrent, bitcomet, etc; for Mac, use Transmission). Just google 'BT client mac'
2. Click the link on top of this page 'DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT' and save the torrent file on your computer.
3. Use your BT client to 'load' the BT torrent file.
4. Wait while download goes.
5. Enjoy your loot.

cheers"
,zhou.fei.fei,2008-04-03T16:36Z,"Hey guys, I'm running this game on a hackintosh (HP DV6245CA) which runs Leopard (10.5.2). I had a bunch of gfx glitches which made the game unplayable, so I tried the update (http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/games/demos_updates/simcity4.html).

But when I ran the updater, in the end it came up with a result of ""internal error"", but the progress bar basically reached its end...

I tried running the game again, still a bunch of gfx glitches...wtf? any help?

PS: I had to install this game onto an NTFS partition as well...not sure if that would affect anything (using Paragon's NTFS Mac for the NTFS read-and-write).

PPS: for those that want to play without the 2nd cd, search for a torrent called '!no_cd', on TPB; it's under the section 'mac > games'

cheers"
,hagolan,2008-04-04T11:23Z,works. but why all those graphic bugs?
,BrocknessMonsta,2008-04-16T08:59Z,"Ok.
So, I got the game installed and all, and everything works but one little detail. When the game launches it changes the output on my computer to the screen, and the monitor reads 'OUT OF RANGE'. I hear the game going in the background though = )
So I went (like suggested by someone else here) and downloaded an update. The update is a .sit file. I have never seen or used or heard of .sit before and can't figure out how to install the update!

Help please!"
,killerzip,2008-07-13T18:58Z,"If you can get it going on a ppc mac, it's a good game.

BTW does anyone have rush hour??!"
,ctee,2008-10-28T19:16Z,"@BrocknessMonsta
.sit file is a Stuffit compression format file.
This file type can be extracted or opened using the free Stuffit Expander program, which can be downloaded from its official website, www.stuffit.com"
,kenny1997510,2010-07-14T09:40Z,try downloading toast titanium and mount the dmg and there may be a disc image which would allow you to play
