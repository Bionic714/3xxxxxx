Odyssey, so named for the emotional and artistic journey it took to make, 
is a vast musical leap forward. Inspired musically by classic and psychedelic 
rock, the familiar Fischerspooner sound is now suffused with analog sounds, 
live instruments and a lush new ambience. Like the albums that inspired it, 
Odyssey is a bona fide headphone record, layered with hidden nuances that 
reward the close listener. Warren Fischer and Casey Spooner recruited a list 
of contributors that includes hit songwriter Linda Perry, music and visual artist 
David Byrne, French producer Mirwais, Susan Sontag, producer Tony Hoffer, 
and others.

Several tracks on Fischerspooner's new album Odyssey are
co-produced/co-written with Mirwais. The album is brilliant!
[Madonna is reported working again with Mirwais on the next album.]
