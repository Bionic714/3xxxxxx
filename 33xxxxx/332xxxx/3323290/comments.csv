Wizardry 1-7 work great under Win 7 with DosBox.  They install directly to your C: drive, but I suggest moving the game folders to your normal programs directory and setting up DosBox accordingly.

This disc is the best source for Bane of the Cosmic Forge and Crusaders of the Dark Savant, as the ultimate archives versions have their copy protection disabled.  (Just press enter when it asks for the magic word/secret clearance.)  This is NOT a crack-  It was actually sold this way in retail by Interplay!

Wizardry Gold is hard-set at 640x480, so I suggest setting desktop resolution to 1024x768 or lower if playing that version of Wizardry 7, to avoid playing with a tiny little game screen in the middle of huge black borders on your HD monitor..."
