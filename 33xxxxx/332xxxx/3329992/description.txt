PLOT

Camp Rolling Hills will never be the same. Not with their newest camp counselor 
Angela Johnson arriving. While there once was nothing but the best summer camp
ever, it's now only a killing field to her. No matter what anyone does, Angela
will have a problem with it. And when this woman has a problem with someone, 
she's not one to try and resolve it through conversation. No, she'd rather find
inventive ways to make all the campers hearts stop beating using anything 
necessary to accomplish her goal. As the number of campers becomes noticably 
slimmer, it's up to one courageous girl to try and get out of Camp Rolling Hills
alive.
