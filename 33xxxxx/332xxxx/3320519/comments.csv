,Pueben,2005-05-02T18:04Z,"Det som verkar saknas är:
""Show"" från '93 (livealbum)
""Paris"" från '93 (också live)

Annars verkar det rätt komplett (enligt thecure.com)

Najs!"
,Pueben,2005-05-02T18:05Z,"Whoops, I forgot it's in English nowadays..

It seems almost complete (according to thecure.com).

However, there are some missing live-albums, i.e.
""Show"" from '93
""Paris"" from '93

Nice work!"

,Aphael,2006-06-09T19:20Z,"4 live albums are missing but the studio collection is complete.

Missing are:

Concert
Entreat
Show
Paris

Out of those four I recommend people to get Paris - it's amazing. :)

Also one or two ""mini"" albums are missing. The Octopus/Half an Octopus EPs comes to mind - I think there's a couple more as well. Also, Join The Dots is well worth getting - in fact, I'd say it's essential hehe."
