Here we go again: the second last disc of Millennium

The last DVD will follow, provided that the person I'm downloading it from doesn't remove it before I've finished.

As I don't know how long I will be able to keep my computer and connection running (I might be going away for a while), I ask all of you to keep your torrents up after you finished downloading - seed! Not only will this make more people happy, it will also make me able to use my space and bandwidth for more important things; downloading and seeding the two final DVDs to all of you. :)

The specifications are as follows:

Video: PAL, Re-encoded
Extras: Untouched
Menu: Untouched
Audio: English
Subtitles: English, Swedish, Italian


A final thanks (again) to mischa who uploaded the previous DVDs of this fantastic series. If you (or anyone else) by any chance are able to upload the final disc before I do, you are more than welcome!
