,Al_Bundy,2005-05-08T15:58Z,"va fan är detta?? jag har seedat 4,37 gb och filen är på 2,89,,,hur kan det då vara så att ingen fått hem detta ännu"
,Brandis,2005-05-08T23:05Z,There's 1 piece missing in the swarm!!!
,Larrikin2,2005-05-09T07:59Z,"Don`t download this.
Home made video with bad sound and flickering picture.
I got it, burned it,  then I throw the dvd in the trashcan.
It can`t be good when someone`s standing back in the crowd trying to get Marilyn in focus between all the heads in front of the camera."
,Al_Bundy,2005-05-09T11:46Z,there is nothing missing.........
,Al_Bundy,2005-05-09T11:47Z,"concider this is a homemade recording the sound is not bad, and i can agree on that the flashing lights can be enoying but overall this is a pretty good homemade shot of the concert,,,and no,it's not me that has recorded it"
,Al_Bundy,2005-05-12T15:39Z,"wierd,because i have the video ts folder burned"
,Al_Bundy,2005-05-14T14:37Z,"no i am not using a mac, I got this dvd from a friend that bought it on ebay, and the only thing i did was to copy it to my hd so that ppl could download it, i am sorry to hear that you have had some problems to get it to work,,,and for me when i am looking at the tv or at the pc there is not such thing as pixled picture or bad sound"
