,Lafa,2005-07-25T20:21Z,"He can't even perform his own exercises. 
He has right, shorten the vocal chords is the first step. Smoothen out your bridges the next step, and controlling your larynx too. 
But his exercises are crap and there are REALLY BETTER WAYS.

He says one when starts may overdo it, and that´s for sure. Try it and you´ll sing like Dani Filth of Cradle Of Filth, but Filth´s voice is peculiar, do like him and you may not sing for years like him."
,Majion,2006-04-23T11:41Z,lol he does suck....
,nangko,2006-07-28T22:07Z,"Man that guy is really a bad singer. Don't know if his excercises are good or bad to do..?

@Lava: If you have got the lessons from www.thevoiceconnection.com, kan you seed the torrents than?"
,vesper8,2006-07-29T11:34Z,couldn't find anything good on torrents but hop on eMule and there are TONS of singing lessons.. i'm downloading several packages as we speak.. just make a search for 'singing lessons' and it comes up with dozens of results!
,Demonix SD,2008-02-15T13:59Z,"I think you guys are bring too hard on him - okay, he may not sing well - however, if done correctly, his exercises really work very well.  I now have the most awesome voice imaginable!"
,capeli,2008-12-06T15:52Z,"He is using the SLS method, Speach Level Singing, i have been using the methods for a while now, and the effect is great.. Too bad he is taking credit for somebody else work. 

Ps. Avoid the ""Fry"" ""Grunt"" shit he is talking about."
,marko8002,2009-06-05T21:28Z,still downloading it... thanks in advance for the upload.
,farty45219,2009-06-06T08:22Z,Gotta be the worst lessons on the planet. Would love to see Four Pillars of Singing (vocalist studio) uploaded. That person would be a GOD.
