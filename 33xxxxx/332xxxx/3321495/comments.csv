Taking its legal status as a ""person"" to its logical conclusion, the film puts the corporation on the psychiatrist's couch to ask: ""What kind of person is it?"" THE CORPORATION exposes the consequences?for human beings, democracy, and our environment?of granting immense power to a structurally amoral institution whose priority is profit. THE CORPORATION includes 40 interviews with corporate insiders and critics plus case studies, true confessions, and strategies for change. 

IF YOU SUPPORT THE FILM, SUPPORT THE FILMMAKERS  

Filmmaker Mark Achbar explains: ""According to bittorent trackers and making conservative extrapolations for other P2P file sharing mechanisms, over  500,000 people have downloaded The Corporation so far. As a filmmaker and activist, one of my goals is to reach the largest possible audience. So from that perspective, it's an astounding success. But I also organized the financing of the film and have continuing obligations.""

?Over 200 people worked on making the film and getting it seen. Our outreach efforts are ongoing. Please consider using the ""contribute"" button on www.thecorporation.com or send a cheque or money order, large or small, to:  Big Picture Media Corporation*, 2676 Eton St., Vancouver, BC, Canada, V5K 1K1. Thanks!?

* Yes, it's ironic. I formed a small corporation to qualify for public funding in Canada.

,freakindawg,2008-01-08T12:08Z,This is a must-see educational piece that deserves to be flaunted to anyone you meet on the street. It helps us understand the dangerous flexibility that corporations have in order to harm civilisation as a whole if they behave with malicious and greedy intent. There are good corporations and bad ones. Beware of the bad ones>They're just out to make a buck.
