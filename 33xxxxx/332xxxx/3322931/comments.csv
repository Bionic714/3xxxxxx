http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4431462/KathrynRose_KathrynRose_2005_FullCD_mp3_[QG]

If you have any of Kathryn Rose's other albums (Every Lurid Detail - 1997, My Little Flame - the original 2001 release or the award-winning enhanced CD 2003 re-release with an extra track featuring Ron Sexsmith) please upload - it would fill a real void because they are practically impossible to find, whether as mp3s or as physical CDs. Same goes for albums of her 90s band Wind May Do Damage."
