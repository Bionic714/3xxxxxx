Take the time to learn about what you are doing. But above all, STOP BLAMING OTHERS when you can't take the time to figure something out.

This set of data works just fine I know how to extract it and burn it to a CD or DVD .

Do your homework..idiots"

,rufaelove,2010-06-09T15:59Z,"The dictionary is in an image format, so anybody who wants to install needs to have a software that supports the image format e.g., Daemon Tools. Once u mount the image, click setup then......"
,hopbest,2011-03-05T10:23Z,"this is for professional user not for common man as in this dictionary complex medical terminology is used. no drug information is given in it. 

for installing the software

first of all extract the file and you will get two file which are actually iso image 
either use software like ulta iso to extract the iso image or you may first burn the software on an empty 700mb cd-disk by clicking in the iso image. in this way you will be able to install the software through the cd you recent burn.

it has two iso image with diffrent file format but both the image contain the same data. "
