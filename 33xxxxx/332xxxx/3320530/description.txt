The Message – The Story of Islam
En mycket bra film från 1976. beskriver Islams första 23 år, då Muhammed levde.

” This is a great film. I'm a history major who took several courses in the history of the Middle East and Islam, so nothing is going to be good or accurate or trivia filled enough for me, but it certainly didn't contradict anything I'd learned (for cinematic purposes or otherwise), and that's more than I can say for any historical epic I've seen in several years.” – från IMDB http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074896/ ::: Pro@
