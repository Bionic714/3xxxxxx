With this widget you can search in categories as well, so you dont have to search the whole piratebay for a xbox game or a Mac application or other stuff that you know is in just one category.
To get a normal listing of the category contents, just select category and delete whatever is in the searchbox and press enter.

Please write a comment if you have anything you would like to see implemented into this widget! I am sure either I or someone else here can do it! :-)


Thanks to the other two people who worked on the other releases, both of their additions is in here as well!
