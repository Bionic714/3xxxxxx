,u-man,2005-05-05T16:54Z,"Does anyone has a Retail-Serial Nr. ?
I heard that the serial here, doesnt work so well. After a few reboots, something cracked up and tiger server will not work anymore. I didnt test it, but thats what they say at MSJ. Can anyone confirm this or has any other useable info to this torrent here ??? I mean seeding 2.5GB is not funny, if this app doesnt work."
,Ssargon,2005-05-05T18:59Z,This app will work when a new serial comes out. It will likely only be a week or two.
,LokoToko,2005-05-06T00:15Z,"""It says 'Retail', but has anyone confirmed this is the same build as the GM/Retail version?""

It is really sure: I have the retail box here in my hands (i am the seeder)."

Please help seed the torrent."

,glimmagic,2005-05-06T17:33Z,"Argh, the site license number is great, but we also need a ""Registered to"" and ""Organization"" info."
,qazwsx123454,2005-05-06T18:16Z,I see now the serial number is the same as the first one :)

OBS! Kan nån ge ett s/n?"
,qazwsx123454,2005-05-12T14:10Z,under General i Server Admin kan man gå in på settings och därifrån hittar du nog till serienumret så du kan byta.
,qazwsx123454,2005-05-29T20:01Z,no one who has found more serial numbers for OSX Server?

Any new serial?"
,cerberus3979,2005-07-08T11:50Z,Well 6-31-05 came and went. If anyone has another serial so we can reboot our servers that would be VERY apprecieated! Until then DO NOT REBOOT or you will be without a server UNTIL a new serial can be found..
,qazwsx123454,2005-07-15T02:11Z,I've tried all serials in serial box 2005-07 - none works!

,fun23,2007-11-17T21:43Z,"Hi and thanks for helpin a nube,

How do I make an osx server instal dvd from a dmg?

How do I burn a dvd to install osx tiger 10.4 server?

I have a copy of osx tiger 10.4 server on a disk image .dmg file.  When I try to copy it from the finder, I get the message:

[INDENT][B]One or more items have special permissions and cannot be copied. Do you want to skip them? (With the option to stop or continue)[/B][/INDENT]

Can I just burn it from the finder? 

THANKS!
Fun"
,strangerw8,2008-03-12T12:30Z,"does anyone know if my serial number can be changed by changing operation systems (overwriting the OS, or deleting and installing a new one)? (the number that you get by clicking on 'about this mac' and then click on the number of your system version) 
Thanks!"
,Ge64,2008-04-26T08:23Z,Anyone have a build number for this? Is it 8A428?
,Bramsky,2008-11-23T15:33Z,Ive burnt it using toast but i can't boot it isnt recognised not even in the nomal os 10.4
,iphonerulez,2009-03-12T23:35Z,"This version works very well.  Bootable, no disk verify errors.  I had some other install disk and I was getting install errors so I figured I'd grab this one.  No problems with this image upload if burned with Disk Utility.  I used some other recent serial number and have updated it to 10.4.11 and it works like a charm on my old FW800 G4 Dualie used as a stand-alone server.

This torrent's been around for a long time.  Thanks to the uploader and those that helped keep the torrent alive."
