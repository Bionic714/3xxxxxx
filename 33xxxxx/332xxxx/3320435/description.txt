Arnold Schwarzenegger's first film.  This is the most muscular he's ever been in any of his movies...right off a cycle of Anadrol-50 I tell you.  I can't believe his liver works still.

I looked long and hard for this version of the DVD.  The version most people have seen, has Arnold Schwarzenegger DUBBED, even though he is speaking English in the movie.  THIS VERSION, is his NATURAL VOICE...hahaha.

This is also the movie that the Jerky Boys used for inspiration for their character SOL ROSENBERG...the annoying little jewish man...you'll notice him instantly...look and sound familiar?  Yeah, no shit, right off of the Jerky Boys CD.
