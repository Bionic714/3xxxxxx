Thank you."
,pwei1995,2005-05-08T04:10Z,"Thanks very much for the DVB versions - I don't suppose you'd be able to post just the Confidential DVB episodes by themselves as well?

Also, any chance of a DVB DWC episode 1? That's the only one I can't find.

Thanks again! "
,DaMixxMaster,2005-05-08T06:25Z,Thank you SO MUCH for such high quality work! Wish more people could do things so well. I will help seed till at least 1:1!
,tobio25,2005-05-08T12:15Z,"im thinking of posting all the confidential episodes together on dvds...  ie, 1-6 on one DVD, 7-12 on another, because they are only small.

I have confidential one, but i had to get it from a friend who recorded it with his set-top-box DVD recorder...  it is still pretty good quality, but it is in 4:3 cropped and isn't a stream dump like mine.

If you just want to watch the program, you can see them in 256Kbps realplayer at http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/confidential/index.shtml 
they are nice like that the BBC"
,tobio25,2005-05-12T02:47Z,"Genosis1: ive PM'd you a while ago, but which client are you using?  
I'm not trying to be funny, but you must be doing something wrong, as I have downloaded /lots/ of torrents over the last year or so, including many iso files, and have never had any corruption problems with any of them (unless the original file was stuffed).  

also, you wouldn't have to delete the whole file if 2Mb was badly downloaded, as you could start the download again and it would correct itself with the data it already has.  Even the original ""vanilla"" bittorrent client does that, in fact i thought they all did.  I have used lots of different clients too, from the original plain bittorrent, to ABC and Azureus which I prefer at the moment, and you do appear to be the only person having such problems."
,PREL,2006-06-14T01:31Z,I can't hear anything on these.  I only get video..(only time I've never been able to hear anything)  any suggestions?
