Fischerspooner's otherworldly documentary soundtrack The Cave
explores Odyssey's creation. Edited by legendary hip-hop producer
Steinski, The Cave offers an unusual insight into Fischerspooner's
creative process, and will ultimately become the audio soundtrack
to a short film. Cameos include Factory Records founder Tony Wilson,
comedian/actor Jimmy Fallon, songwriter Linda Perry and photographer
Mick Rock, among many others.
