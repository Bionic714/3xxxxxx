,britney66,2005-05-02T11:45Z,"Yeah, not very smart to remove those nordic subs.

,nukec,2005-05-03T11:35Z,"this is slosub version, for slovenian local market you stoff11d n00bz...

thank reptile, you are tha man"
,reptile256,2005-05-03T18:37Z,"sorry :(

i'll get into it next time, so that i keep those original subs withouth OCRing with subrip (i cant ocr swedish or other, because you have special characters).

i fully understand your disagreement with this and hope that you won't ban our custom non-nordic releases. we in slovenia love this tracker and it would be a great loss to us.

respect,
