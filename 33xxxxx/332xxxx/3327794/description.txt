<b>Stereo Future - Japan 2001</b>
  "Stereo Future" is four entangled stories about being young and living it up as best as you can. The forefront of the film is Keisuke, a fraught actor whose only parts seem to be in non speaking extras in samurai films. His ex-girlfriend, Eri Momosaki, has gone mute from the break-up and is struggling herself in finding meaning in her life after love. Along with her sister Koharu who feels all alone in spreading the word about world pollution and saving the planet, both the Momosaki sisters, Keisuke and the rest of the cast are drifting around trying to find the fun in their lives and meaning in their hearts.
