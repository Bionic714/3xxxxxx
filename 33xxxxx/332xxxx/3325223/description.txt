	In the tradition of "The Atomic Cafe," RADIO BIKINI transports us back to The Cold War, a 

terrifying time when the threat of nuclear war was part of daily life. Told in a hauntingly 

perceptive tone, this critically-acclaimed film is one of the most powerful and insightful films 

ever made on the overwhelming destructiveness of nuclear power. By using extraordinary and rarely 

seen archival footage, much of which was once kept classified by the U.S. government, director 

Robert Stone brings to light the largely untold story of Bikini Atoll. A peaceful and tropical 

island located in the Pacific, it was the unwitting site of a series of high-profile atomic bomb 

tests conducted by the U.S. in 1946. With startling eyewitness accounts by a naval serviceman and 

the chief of the native Bikinians, the film reveals the stark reality of these tests- thought to 

be harmless, they instead left Bikini island uninhabitable for over 40 years and exposed thousands 

of sailors to heavy doses of radiation. The film's virtually surreal footage of sailors fishing in 

contaminated waters, mushroom clouds filling the skies, and top level government officials 

professing the safety of the tests leaves us in utter shock and disbelief- how could something 

so horrific have gone untold for so long?
