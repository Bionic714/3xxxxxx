I wasn't willing to spend close to $100.00 to get this on DVD, so I ripped it from VHS and put it on a DVD.  This isn't the official DVD version, just a VHS copy transferred to DVD.  The torrent is made up of the DVD files (e.g., AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS).

And no, it's not a great movie.  But hey, it was when I was a kid.
