,juggleruk,2005-04-26T18:00Z,"Gotta feeling previous post is the same as this.
What do I do to get this on CD?"
,bd40,2005-04-26T22:55Z,Typ Nero bränn audio precis som när du bränner mp3 till wave ljud inga konstigheter.
,dredawg,2005-04-27T10:52Z,"Use Sony DVD Studio:

,gnill,2005-05-22T18:31Z,Where do these posts that are in DTS actually come from? Is it ripped from a CD but then converted to DTS? Or are these albums actually released in DTS format from the beginning and just ripped straight off the album?  As far as i know Paranoid has not been releaead as a DVD-Audio for example and with a DTS on it. I might be wrong but whats the source of the file? 
,mjtannin,2005-07-12T11:30Z,"In case someone is interested: I created a cue file to get those tracks out of this single dtswav in nero. Just create a .cue file containin following lines and open it with nero to burn. Note names and or track positions may not be exactly correct, but I'm happy with it.

,mjtannin,2005-07-12T11:36Z,"Damn, this commentfield doesn't display linebreaks.  If you view page source there linebreaks are just fine (linebreak before every PERFORMER, TITLE, FILE, TRACK and INDEX)."
,jampam,2005-07-16T13:40Z,"just in case, some tries to burn it in toast (os x). you need to rename the file to .wav, and also do that in the .cue file et voila, you can burn this disc too.. i just haven't managed yet, to burn the .gi (other dts-releases) files, anyone can help?"
,dredawg,2005-07-19T07:41Z,"Great CUE Sheet!  That works awesome!  Now I just mount the the .CUE using Daemon Tools and play it with PowerDVD. Here's that CUE again with  substituted for line breaks, search and replace on those with n in a decent txt editor..cue follows here:
