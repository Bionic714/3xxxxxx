,daklaw,2008-05-15T03:49Z,"is it just me or does the movie end short at 1:55:20?

the movie just stopped there and I'm sure that wasn't the end of the movie."
,thedeadredhead,2009-10-17T05:14Z,"Sounds about right. IMDB has it listed as 118 minutes, which I expect includes the end credits.

Also, thanks to the uploader."
