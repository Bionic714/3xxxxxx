,ricke_17,2005-05-03T10:23Z,hur öppnar man en port som i brandväggen?
,taison,2005-05-03T10:26Z,this version sucks bigtime doesn´t work with NOD32 antivirus uses 100% cpu power if IMON is enabled Azureus 2.2.0.2 i better for NOD32 users.
,Muifa,2005-05-03T14:50Z,"Uses 100% CPU if your installed java runtime version is less than 1.50 , otherwise not !!"
,taison,2005-05-03T15:20Z,i have the latest java but still with NOD32 it uses 100% cpu

,blendax,2005-05-03T22:04Z,Works fine for me with NOD32 and everything else too!
,jobflower,2005-05-04T23:18Z,Thank U !
,rec,2005-05-30T16:25Z,"You have to add javaw.exe to the exclusion list in IMON of nod32. Perhaps also with AMON. Then Azureus and nod32 will work together.

Remember: If you are having problems, you are doing something wrong. Azureus and nod32 DO WORK TOGETHER."
