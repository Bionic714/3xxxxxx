Stephen King's Golden Years. Retail. PAL. Nordic subs (Dansk, Svenska, Norsk, Suomi).
This is a long film and if i had compressed it to fit a 4,7 GB dvd the quality would  have gone down to 45%. That would not have been good enough for this great movie so therefore i have chosen to rip it in 100% picture quality.
Use your favorite dvd decode program to make it fit a dvd or split it up if want.
