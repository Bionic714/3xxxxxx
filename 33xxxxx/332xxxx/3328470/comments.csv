,joseflarsen,2005-06-24T14:39Z,"catflap: Im not an expert but I think it CAN be both a telesync and a screener at the same time.. Isnt telesync the tecnique wich its ripped with, and screener is the version, so to speak? A screener is when a movie is screened before an evaluating-audience, so it might not even be the actual version thats shown on the movies! A telesync is when the movie is ripped with a cam in front of the projektor (I dont know exactly how its done), and the sound is added directly from the source, and not via microphone. Thus, telesyncs tend to have quite bad video-quality in general and good or very good sound. Please correct me if Im wrong.. "
