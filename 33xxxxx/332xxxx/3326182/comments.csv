,Kaitaine,2008-05-08T00:46Z,"great game eatinggoats saw some of the huge bosses and had to try it out take it easy dude, peace."
,Neferil,2008-05-22T22:21Z,"Can't find a no-cd crack. There's none in the downloadfile and i couldnt find one on gamecopyworlds website either, only for Painkiller overdose. Any1 got a hint where i can find a crack?"
,HeroicJeff,2008-05-23T06:26Z,"To play the game, install it (there's a keygen on disc 1), then go open disk one, there is a folder called DEViANCE, in there is the crack (engine.dll). Find the directory you installed it to, go into the ""Bin"" folder and replace Engine.dll with the engine.dll from the DEViANCE folder... That's it. Enjoy, it's an awesome game."
,afipanic,2008-05-23T22:57Z,"or you can just buy it for all the yahtzee fans. its 10 dollars on steam. not gonna break the bank, especially if its wayyy to complicated to figure out how to run it from this guy"
,jjoness,2008-05-26T01:44Z,"Great game and works perfectly - just got done playing a few levels. Anyone having difficulty installing and playing shouldn't be downloading anyway because they are too stupid. There's install info, a keygen and the cracked engine.dll all on disc 1 in the deviance folder. If you've got more than one working brain cell, install is about as easy as you can get."
,tangentreality,2008-07-07T17:15Z,"This game does work, it's a matter of knowing how to get it to work.  Read the comments that have been left by others and try to follow their advice, do not simply post ""IT DOESN'T WORK"" because it does and you are a douchewaffle."
,civvys,2008-07-22T00:34Z,"I don't know what these crack heads are talking about this doesn't work when opened with DAEMON tools it just installs the game there's no DEViANCE, folder or a engine.dll crack or anything, unless I'm doing something wrong or these comments are coming from another site not piratebay (wtfsauce) but anyone some where memory error comes up when you try to run it."
,TheGuite,2008-07-22T09:28Z,"I've installed games this way dozens of times before, but this one has me stumped. I'm able to get everything working smoothly enough through the installation until the very end where it asks me for disc FOUR. 4. And for the life of me, I can't make it work now. The third disc doesn't work, nor does anything else I got from this torrent. Suggestions? This installation is killing me!"
,archnisse,2008-08-07T02:06Z,i installed it succesfully and when im finished and tries to launch the game it gives me an error.  have someone manages to get through this?
,Lord_Mrakainus_of_Ulda,2008-10-04T23:40Z,"Please Seed, I have 4.66% to go man!"
,RickyTheFish,2008-10-12T12:25Z,"I can install it just fine, but for some reason the game runs WAY too fast to play; the in-game timer is about 2.5x faster than real time, and everything in-game acts as such.  I've even turned all graphical options to their highest setting hoping my video card would get bogged down, but to no avail.

Anyone else have a problem with a decently fast computer actually running this game TOO well?  I have Windows Vista, Athlon 64 5600+, nVidia GeForce 8600GT, 2GB RAM... haven't had this problem with any other game... at least, those games that actually RUN on Vista... but that's another issue altogether."
,Gary4u,2008-10-18T18:54Z,"wright information,-  ""Bin"" folder and replace Engine.dll with the engine.dll from the DEViANCE folder..."

,transitvan,2008-12-27T13:41Z,"Works for me. Thanks for the upload good game.
For all you who are struggling to install just follow crescent3's post. The key worked too.
I used Power iso, running xp."
,Gisborn24,2009-02-15T08:24Z,Thanks! Works just fine.
,Drokles,2009-04-13T18:28Z,"Brilliant torrent.
Cd key for anyone who need it:

67ed-d86f-7f62-47b2

Also, just copy the file engine.dll from cd1 into the bin folder in your painkiller directory to replace the Engine.dll that's already there.

The only thing this torrent needs is a better discription."
,Marci1900,2009-04-23T19:30Z,If I click on the file dev-PK1 than comes  C: Users/Marci/Desktop/Painkiller/dev-pk1.bin   The archive is either an unknown format or damaged. This is so for all files.
,Alluboy,2009-05-24T08:18Z,"Marci, you need to mount the files with daemon tools."
,badboy09480,2009-06-06T07:10Z,The torrent installs correctly but when i get halfway though the game it crashes when I try to load and save games.
,vlad_ivx,2009-06-20T19:53Z,Thanks! It worked.

,YourTheBestAxxo,2009-10-19T16:49Z,"okey, for the guys who manage to install it perfedtly to can't start it. u have to open dev-pk1 (.bin) in powerISO and open DEViANCE then replace that engine.dll file with the one in your instalation destination/painkiller/bin"
,Ravell3184,2009-12-08T22:39Z,"Awesome torrent

,D3th2K,2010-03-04T23:05Z,"sigh, I get a Setup was Unsuccessful error when it is installing the textures from cd 2. I'll try a different folder, if that doesn't work, I'm giving up on this torrent."
,boomjack,2010-03-18T11:03Z,"If it is a Deviance release, it must work well. Downloading..."
,ricarduks,2010-03-20T16:44Z,awsome scary game thx
,danii555,2010-03-30T22:43Z,"Awesome! Heres what i did to make it work (windows XP):
1. Mount the ""dev-pk1.bin""
2.install the game, When it asks for serial use the Key-Gen in the deviance folder.(in the CD)
3.Crack the game by replacing ""Engine.dll"" with the one in the game dir.
4.Then Play!

Enjoy! :D"
,ejdkeg,2010-04-26T03:30Z,"Okay, so I have daemon tools, and it installed successfully. Now when I try running it it tells me to put the correct CD Rom in the drive, though I have it mounted.

I tried that business with the engine.dll file, but it won't let me delete the file. It says everyone must approve, even though only I use this laptop, and am the administrator.

Any ideas?"
,alexaras1313,2010-06-15T00:12Z,is this good game????????
,sync123,2010-06-24T09:40Z,"Plz need help! Why is the cue files for? I installed with bin. and the error comes up ""The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000142)""!! Do I have to crack the engine.dll?"
,sync123,2010-06-24T11:59Z,"I got this now.
My tutorial:
1.)Mount dev-pk1.bin with deamontools. Install.
2.)Then mount pk2.bin
3.)mount pk3.bin
4.)When game installed, Use PowerISO to mount pk1.bin and go deviance folder and copy engine.dll to - \painkiller\bin.

Btw use PowerISO on pk1 to get keygen."
,kaveman1969,2010-07-13T00:41Z,Installed fine. When I try to play it tells me to insert the proper CD. I still have disk 1 mounted. Found a No-CD patch and that didn\'t work either.nnAny ideas? nnThanks
,Vesll,2010-07-25T10:42Z,When i try to copy the engine.dll it tells me i have a ms-dos issue. any idea on how to bypass or fix this?
,Xxjason420xX,2010-12-22T03:42Z,"For anyone having the ""Setup was unsuccessful"" error all you have to do is open dev-pk2 copy the contents to your desktop same with dev-pk3

Then mount dev-pk1 and install took me a while to figure it out "
,blackxino,2010-12-26T17:17Z,"don't upgrade to 1.62 v because it overwrites the install file.

,Truvbay,2012-09-03T21:04Z,"Works perfectly. Just have to follow the instructions.

STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS:

If you have followed the instructions but cannot get the game to run, do the following.

1. Turn off your computer.
2. Sell it.
3. Buy a tablet."
