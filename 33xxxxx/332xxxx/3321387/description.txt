Here are instructions on how to play Stronghold 2 without a crack!
Works for both version 1.0 and 1.1!!


If you don't want to make any misstakes, I have written it all down in a textfile, where everything is written down correctly!!!!!

You need to make two shortcuts.

In the "target" for shortcut 1, you write:

"C:ProgramWindows Resource KitsToolssubinacl.exe"  /keyreg "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINEHARDWAREDevicemapSCSISCSI Port 1" /deny=administratörer=r

You may need to change the portnumber from 1.. try using 0, then 1, then 2, then 3... etc..

In the "target" for shortcut 2, you write:

"C:ProgramWindows Resource KitsToolssubinacl.exe"  /keyreg "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMMountedDevices" /deny=administratörer=r

To play the game, you need to open both shortcuts, and then start the game from the original exe!

(you need to do this after every reboot of the system)
