,Norvegia,2005-04-27T11:30Z,"Some time ago I had a conversation with Zettie regarding the quality levels he used to describe the encodes he uploaded; mainly, we discussed the meaning of the ""good"" word for an HDTV encoding, cause been it High Definition, good would not have to be allowed, so to say.

And in this case, in my opinion, and after downloading it, I can say that this is that kind of ""good"" encodes that don't make justice to the High Definition. The picture seems to be a little blurry (you can notice it looking at the ""Walt Disney"" logo at the beginning), and the encode itself is definately not the best around.

But, anyway, and despite all of this, I must thank you for uploading High Definition content to the Piratebay, cause there hasn't been much of this over here lately.

Cheers and keep up the good work."

,IIDX,2006-05-23T13:09Z,How do I play these files? Please help.
,IIDX,2006-05-23T13:10Z,"I've tried everything from WM10, to theatretek to VLC player and none will play it. It says the format is .cd1 and .cd2 in my windows, please help!"
,bodini69,2006-06-20T18:48Z,No sound!
,Arwin,2006-07-15T19:45Z,"wont try, the file is too small, bitrate will be too low to really produce that gorgeous digital crisp hidef image, a shame, would have liked this one al lot"
,VirtualMark,2007-11-24T16:07Z,"This bullshit is most definitely NOT high definition.  The video is rendered at 560 by 320!  Which means that the 720 by 480 of a standard dvd is actually higher than this supposedly 'high def' copy.  The 720p standard requires a resolution of 1280 by 720, this crap isn't even standard def, don't waste your time and bandwidth. "
