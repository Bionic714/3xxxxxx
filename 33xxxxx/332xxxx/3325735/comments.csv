Very important information :-)"

,Luteous,2005-05-08T10:44Z,"Crappy vocalist???

HeÂ´s simply the greatest!! You just have to get used to his slightly odd voice."

,mutherfockingFBM,2008-04-24T08:20Z,"so this was filmed in the town i live in... lawrence, ks.... 

From 1947 until 1981, Lawrence was the location of the Centron Corporation, one of the major industrial and educational film production companies in the United States at the time. The studio was founded by two University of Kansas graduates and employed university students and faculty members as advisers and actors. Also, many talented local and area filmmakers were given their first chances to make movies with Centron, and some stayed for decades. Others went on to successful careers in Hollywood. One of these local residents, Herk Harvey, was employed by Centron as a director for 35 years and in the middle of his tenure there he made a full-length theatrical film, Carnival of Souls, a horror cult film shot mostly in Lawrence and released in 1962. The Centron Corporation soundstage and residing building is now called Oldfather Studios and houses the University of Kansas film program."
