For me this is one of the true essential Progressive recordings of all time and certainly is JETHRO TULL at its finest moment. What makes this recording work so well for me is the careful attention to the song writing that occured during these sessions. Like many great masterpieces the songs are long and are given the space to build into some breathtaking proggy moments. As per normal JETHRO TULL, musicianship is exceptionally high and Anderson's flute playing is highly inspiring.
