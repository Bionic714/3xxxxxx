How much cocaine can one man do?  That all depends on who you ask.  If you were to ask Robert Downey Jr. how much cocaine HE could do in a single night...well...I think you might be suprised by the answer.  Watch this movie, and watch his REAL life leak out onto the screen.  How much of that was acting?

So, we have Drugstore cowboy for the 70's, Trainspotting for the 90's, Spun for the 00's, it's time to fill in the 80's now.  I think every era should be complete, and have it's own drug movie.

Mini Plot:

Clay, an eighteen-year-old freshman, comes back from his first term at a college in New Hampshire to spend his Christmas vacation with his broken-up wealthy family in Los Angeles. His former girlfriend, Blair, is now involved with his ex-best-friend, Julian. She warns Clay that Julian needs help: he is using a lot of cocaine and has huge debts. What follows is a look at the youth culture of wealthy post adolescents in Beverly Hills with a strong anti-drug message. Apart from the setting and the names, the film has very little to do with Bret Easton Ellis's book by the same title on which it was based.
