[T],sickboy88,2005-04-24T01:29Z,What? The DVD writter?
,Mr_Modern,2005-04-24T09:55Z,"Ah, this is based on a Breett Easton Ellis novel....that man can is fantastic"
,tangled,2005-04-24T13:43Z,"aah, thanks thanks thanks!
the book is fantastic and i've been wanting to see this for... forever. 
:)"
,weebl,2005-04-24T16:05Z,"where is the .idx file for the vobsub file?  'cause vobsub subtitles WONT WORK without it.  the file you have added to the torrent includes only the subpictures (graphics) in them selves, but without the .idx file vobsub can't and won't show anything."
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-24T21:55Z,"It's .sub

It works fine via the directshow filter that comes with vobsub.  I played it with windows media player, and DivX's player, and the subtitles popped up.  All you have to do is right click on the screen somewhere, and choose subs."
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-24T22:12Z,"Goddamn, I didn't zip the .idx  into the archive, you're right.  I appologize for that.  I am used to using OCR with SUBrip, and saving it as a single .srt file...I spaced out and didn't include the .idx :(

I'll have to wait till my buddy is done with the disk."
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-24T22:20Z,"That was a good catch bro, I did the same fucking thing in Elektra.  I knew that EVENTUALLY, the drugs were going to fuck with my mind..."
,foomonger,2005-04-25T01:45Z,"yes, .srt is good.

-fm"
,bt72hw,2005-04-25T04:40Z,"All forgotten sub files aside - THANK YOU for upping this movie! I had just finished up reading the Bret Easton Ellis novel upon which it's based for the 3rd time and was cursing the fact I don't own the film to compare the two. 

If anyone has not yet read the novel, you should. But be warned - it is 100 times darker, more violent and even more depraved than the movie. In other words ""Not For Everyone"" - Easton Elis is the guy who wrote ""American Psycho"" a few years after 'Less Than Zero' and both books caused massive outcry from conservatives who wanted them banned in the US.

Again Thank You!! "
,mun,2005-04-30T20:10Z,"sickboy, thanks so much for your nice movies!

btw do you mind uploading the subs for this movie again in the future?

it would be really nice if you could rip the subs for your future uploads as well, cause some of my frds are not as good in english. THANKS very much!!"
[T],sickboy88,2005-07-23T02:45Z,"I do subs for every movie that HAS THEM on the dvd.  Anything before xvid 1.0.1 and divx 5.1.1 I didn't do subs, because no one cared back then.

We get a lot of lame region 1 dvd's, that have no extra features or anything."
,vla108,2005-08-15T08:40Z,Does any one of you gentlemen know where i can find the sountrack?
