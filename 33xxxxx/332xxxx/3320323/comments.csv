[T],sickboy88,2005-04-23T19:34Z,"Yes, it's a totally horrible movie.  The bear he wrestles is a man in a suit.  IT IS HORRIBLE...that is why it is so good!

Again, a CULT type movie...which should NOT be watched by those who don't know the differece between a MOVIE and a FILM.

If you like mainstream movies, it's probably best not to download anything I have made, unless you KNOW that it's a mainstream movie."
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-23T19:35Z,"Very cool...you comment on one movie, and it goes to another movie.  This tracker is great.

Yes, of course the gore is fake.  If it wasn't, it would be called PORN, or SNUFF."
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-23T21:52Z,"So that's NOT an issue only I am experiencing...with the comments.  It seems like every other comment I leave, shows up on the comment counter, but does not show up in the comment section.

Anyone else besides us two having this problem?"
,McKack,2005-04-24T06:55Z,"me too, I make a comment and it's counted but not visible..."
,Werm,2005-04-25T08:06Z,"Yup, comments are fucked up... I believe the problem has to do with either ad/referrer/cookie blocking software. 'Least that is my prob as my comments seem to go through when i turn these off.... but wtf knows ;P

Once again thanks for a great post!"
,emper0r,2005-07-14T23:48Z,"And again nice work sickboy88, as soon as i get it i will seed it, keep up the good work :)"
[T],sickboy88,2005-07-17T11:13Z,"No, thanks for the comment man.  No harm done.  I welcome all ""legitimate"" feedback.  A lot of people hated this film, but I thought it was pretty funny."

,mafe0300,2007-07-23T23:27Z,"This movie was... what word to use? ... I think....
Maybe interesting is proper.
But maybe it should be under Horrors instead of porn? Anyway dont regret for downloading (I'll seed) Thanks."
,boodis,2007-12-29T09:34Z,"eldtobbe you sad retard, you do know there was this people called the romans ye? A people who hailed and saluted to show respect ye? Oh, Hitler didn't not invent ""I hail you"".

Hope that was written in an easy way enough for school rejects to understand."
,ANicki_InTheUk,2008-01-22T06:31Z,"this is really shit, i like a good sick horror, but this is crap. I'm not bitter, just taking a few seconds out of my busy life to save you hours and disk space. Because I'm so nice like that."
,mistyblue,2008-04-04T09:37Z,"grt collection u have got!!

,Riggers76,2009-11-07T04:59Z,"Hahaha, thats all i can say, cut the gravestone sceens and your left with about 20 minutes of serious femminist revenge fantasy. If you liked this, try watching Tomboys, just as terrible."
