Description: ‘Live on the Darkness on the Edge of Town’ from the Watchdog label features a newly unearthed source tape of the famous ‘Largo 78’ pro-shot footage. This ~2nd generation copy is a major improvement in picture quality when compared to the previously circulated 3rd/4th generation versions. The washed out colours are replaced by more vivid tones and the rolling lines of interference are (mostly) absent.
Whilst undeniably a great upgrade, this is still not the ‘Holy Grail’ that some had hoped for. ‘Jungleland’ is still cut and the tantalising clips from the show in documentaries such as ‘Glory Days’ demonstrate that there is still plenty of room for further improvement. The bitrate is also rather low (the show is squeezed onto one and a half discs) and so an XP transfer of the same tape would probably be slightly better.

The DVD also includes some truly fantastic extras. The Phoenix ’78 footage will be familiar to most collectors and here it is presented from no less than four different source. The best of these (#1) appears to be from an original CBS promo tape with a razor-sharp image, but unfortunately a time stamp is superimposed on the bottom of the frame. The other sources are similar to what we’ve seen before, except for ‘Promised Land’ which is in poor quality.

Finally, the pro shot footage of Bruce’s guest spot with Southside Johnny at the Agora Club, Cleveland in 1978 is also drawn from a stunningly good new source. The set is wrapped together with some fairly average menu designs.

This currently represents the best version of this classic show.
