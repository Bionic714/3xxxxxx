,howcho,2009-06-16T07:07Z,"I watched part 1 and am working on part 2.  I am really having trouble watching this guy,  I do not find him a great speaker in the least.  There is just too much bullshit before he gets to the point.  I will keep watching however as I do believe I could learn something."
