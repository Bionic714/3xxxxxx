This is the famous documentary made by Michelangelo Antonioni in 1972 at the invitation of chinese government, who subsequently banned it for "presenting China in a wrong way". The film in its full length was screened in a de facto public occasion last year in Beijing Film Academy though.

So far the film has not been released in any (?) format, this is said to be the only source circulating on the internet, a friend got it from eMule. hope you'll enjoy it!
