Re: subtitles, there are divx subs out there, but not sure how helpful it will be with the real player files"
,imetoh,2007-02-01T04:04Z,"1. d/l english subs (chinese also avail there) at open sub

2. load subs after changing output according to following directions:

How do I view .srt files with .rmvb files?
You MUST install Real Alternative (which is a codec that lets you play real media files without real media player). Media Player Classic (MPC) comes with Real Alternative when you install it. Open MPC, drag the .rmvb file into the player, then drag the .srt file into the player right after.

Troubleshooting:
If subtitles are not showing, try the following settings-
1. Go to View > Options, under ""Playback"", click on ""Output"".
2. In ""DirectShow Video"", select ""VMR9 (renderless)"".
3. Try loading the video and subtitles file again.

Other alternatives:
If you don't like MPC, you can also try other players such as GOMplayer, BSplayer, KMPlayer...etc. If you want to play the subs straight from your Windows Media Player, you can install the CCCP pack, or klite codec pack + vobsub. "
,imetoh,2007-02-01T04:06Z,forget the dragging. just load the subs to MPC after changing the output to VMR 9
