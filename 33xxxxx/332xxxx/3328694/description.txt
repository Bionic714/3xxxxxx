Written by: Michael Palmer 

Plot:

Out in the Nevada desert ("80 miles in all directions") is a secret facility with lots of subbasements. When a computer team is called in to repair the place and find out what happened to the crew, chaos reigns. The team starts to get eaten one by one by a group of very intelligent dinosaurs, often smarter than the humans. The two women in the group have the messiest deaths (one like Aliens, the other is a piece-by-piece meal). A boy and one member of the team manage to get out, only to find a single T-rex after them. The facility was sitting on a uranium mine, so with some dynamite the two blow it up and escape on an Evac helicopter.
