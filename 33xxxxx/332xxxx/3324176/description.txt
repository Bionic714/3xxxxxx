As many of you are probably aware, the PS2 has problems running DVD9 games
backed up onto dual layer media due to to problems reading from the second
layer. This is because the data format on burnt DL discs is different than on 
pressed discs (burnt = OTP, pressed = PTP). However, we have discovered a 
software hack which allows the PS2 to read even burnt OTP discs resulting in
working dual layer backups! Our Toxic firmware for DMS4 chips already includes
auto-patching functionality which applies our software hack on the fly when
booting games on dual layer media. For those without a DMS4, we present the
Toxic Dual Layer Image Patcher! The patcher works by applying our software
hack to the game image (.iso, .gi etc) before burning. Once the hack has
been applied by our patcher, burn the modified image to dual layer media
and play! This method will enable anybody with a modchip capable of booting
DVD9 media to backup and _play_ DVD9 games such as Gran Turismo 4.
