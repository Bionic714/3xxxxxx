...don't waist your time with this! The audio quality is so poor, that is not even funy. There is more background noise on the taple then the ""comedt"" it self.... so, please DO NOT spread it around the internet...

..rar file, may be because the guy included a text file, but obviously the guy does not know what he is doing to release such a lousy quality audio file....
