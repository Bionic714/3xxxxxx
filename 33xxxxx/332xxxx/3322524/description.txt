OK here's the Specials live on Rock Goes To College from 1979, this was first broadcast in January 1980. I taped it when it was reshown on the Satellite channel UK Gold a couple of years back so the quality is a perfect first generation copy. I post this for all those who enjoy a bit of 70's two tone now and then.

These are in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and they will play in most DVD players. They will fit on 2x 80min blank cd-r's using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.         http://www.videolan.org/
