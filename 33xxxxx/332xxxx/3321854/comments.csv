I have one question though: why do you need to acces the internet at some points during the game?
"
,Lamer234,2005-07-05T19:50Z,"Probs here too can get it to work!!!!!
I tryed mounting it with deamon tool, still no result, hmmm did you guys do as its told in how too crack superpower or what HELP!!!!!"
,Moderati,2005-07-05T20:45Z,"On the odd chance that someone is reading these, I'm having a serial issues as well. I can't find a keygen on the net anywhere for Superpower 2. I also couldn't find one inbedded in the images.

Any ideas?"
,Frank_Bach,2005-07-15T17:21Z,"Need serial key for this torrent! Please upload in a different torrent the cd-key if needed, because there is no key on the files. Thx."
,Wittgenstein,2005-07-28T18:08Z,"De som tjatar om serial är antingen dumma i huvudet eller anställda av APB. Kopiera över innehållet i mappen ""crack"" på första CD:n så är det bara att köra sedan."
,dark_kotten,2006-01-16T21:49Z,"Jävla skit, jag har haft det här spelet förut, men nu när jag försöker spela det så kommer det upp ""Device lost"" när jag crackar det, jag har testat uppdatera och testa en annan crack, men det funkar ej, sen testa jag mini-image men det funka inte heller! "

,Reconcilliation,2007-04-09T08:14Z,"Don't download this, the key doesn't work, and the installer has problems with Daemon Tools. [In that, you mount an image, and the autorun doesn't recognize the disc.]"
,Ypoons,2007-06-03T18:30Z,"There is a crack on CD1.
Works perfect by me"
,mupapa,2007-06-15T15:50Z,how can i properly install this game without error?
,black_library,2007-10-15T13:39Z,"Wont work on my PC, I install, run the game > single player and when I hit custom game or scenario I get error report... Also it never asked for any cd keys..."
,Slakpad,2008-01-02T23:33Z,"plees seed, i'll take over when finnished. thank you for this great game."
,anbu1,2008-01-27T04:52Z,"I figured out how to make the crack work!!!
here are the steps:

1: install the game then reboot your PC
2:you still can't use the game because the crack hasn't been applied yet so re-insert disc #1 but DO NOT auto-run it instead go to computer and then right click on the drive that contains the disk and click on ""explore""
3: once the window pops up the first folder you will see is a folder named ""crack"" copy it to your desktop.
4:open the  location were you installed superpower 2 and then go back to your desktop  or wherever you copied the ""crack"" file and double left-click it then you will see 2 files the first one is ""joshua"" and the second one is ""ginger_sdk.dll"" 
5:copy the joshua filefrom the ""crack file you got from the disc #1 and then go to the place you installed superpower 2 and you will see a file called ""xerces-c_2_1_0.dll"" copy the joshua file onto the xerces-c_2_1_0.dll file and then a window will pop-up saying ""a joshua file already exists do you want to replace it?"" click yes
6:copy the ginger_sdk.dll file that you got from the crack file on disc #1 and then go back to the location you installed superpower 2 and copy the ginger_sdk.dll file onto another file that is also called ""ginger_sdk.dll"" and then a window will pop-up saying ""ginger_sdk.dll already exists do you want to replace it?"" click yes
7: your done!!! you can play the game it worked for me sorry if i didn't explain it very well i hope i helped i took me about 4 hours to figure this all out lol"
,mr_shadow_113,2008-08-14T02:41Z,Does this have the modding feature
,mr_shadow_113,2008-08-14T03:12Z,sorry I mean the GL editor
,ATC_freak,2008-12-09T08:53Z,the crack has a VIRUS. Trojan.Crypt.XPACK.gen
,Notzen,2008-12-10T15:29Z,Thanks a lot =)
,Silimaure,2009-01-14T07:49Z,"My game loads up fine but when I chose a custom game, after about 10 mins my game crashes, system error message says Joshua error."
,stg1,2009-03-29T12:56Z,"O.K., I have the same problem with this Joshua server.I install the version 1.0,than i put 1.4 update,and after playing for a while ,i tried to load a save but  the game drop me off,and tells me that there is a problem with Joshua server.I have to mension that this problem is when the player(me) has conquer some contries,when there is no conquering - everything is fine.So,if anyone here know something about the problem.My OS i Win XP SP2."
,Barbarus1,2009-06-17T23:42Z,"""windows cannot access the specified device, path or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item.""

this is what i get when i start joshua.exe. I run XP, i am an administrator, turned of firewall and AV before extracting and i tried to set ownership under properties>security>advanced>owner.

I get this also with other versions found on TPB, but i don't have this problem with any other executable.

any sugestions anyone? it would e greatly appreciated "
,1Random_Guy,2009-08-04T13:19Z,"DO AS ANBU1 SAYS!! WORKS PERFECT,THANKS."
,Raussno,2009-08-05T23:18Z,"Thanks to anbu1 I have successfully installed and am able to play the game. But, during custom games I get an error report and the game shuts down. Any suggestions?"
,thegamemaster97,2009-08-16T02:06Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!! HAS VIRUS!!!!!!!!
IT GAVE ME 3 BSODS AND I HAD TO SYSTEM RESTORE. THOSE ARE 3 HOURS OF MY LIFE THAT I WONT GET BACK!!!! DONT DOWNLOAD!!!!!"
,cgijoe123,2009-11-04T15:44Z,"Il seed this for you all, games with few seeders risk to be halted, like spartan -.-, rly wanted that one, so il seed for a long time and hopefully more ppl will too, dont think its virus to everyone that says so it has the trusted mark. But what anbu1 wrote is just regular cracking, its easy."
,Tristar101,2010-01-07T04:48Z,"HELP!
I have Windows Vista!
What do I do? 
It says I cant run it unless I have XP, ME, or 2000!"
,filipinohero,2010-05-08T02:48Z,"Hi.

I am very thankful to pctorrent for this wonderful upload. I read the comments and they encountered a problem with the crack. Some said the crack was a virus. I downloaded this to see for myself and it happened to me too. 

However I did not gave up. I researched the internet. I found out that even to legit customers, some are having trouble with joshua crack because it is unstable.

I am now here to clean the name of the uploader and to clean the name of the game. This does not have a virus and I found a solution.

After installing the game, download the patch 1.40, here is the link.

After you patched the game, download the crack for the v.1.4 ENG 

Link:

Extract the contents to the game folder.

I hope I helped. I want to help but I do not know how to make cracks, break codes, etc. As a return of good will, this is the least I could do. I hope all of us have fun. Enjoy. Proud2bePinoy"
,foolio468,2010-07-13T18:26Z,"anbu1, i\'m not following u. how do u copy the joshua file onto the xerces-c_2_1_0.dll file?n"
,dedutch,2010-07-19T18:51Z,"Thanks filipinohero,

I own the game and was asked for a cd key after updating, couldnt believe it!!! it was a legit copy without a cd key.

luckily i could get the game to work by patching to v1.4 and applying the crack.

thanks dude!"
,borisagrees,2011-02-13T00:49Z,doesnt work for windows 7. damnit i wish i had my old xp sp2!!! damnit all to hell lad..
,joskip,2011-04-16T18:20Z,"i've got two things you might want to try if you're a windows 7/vista user and the game doesn't work:
1. go to the exe file in your program files folder
2. right click, properties, then click the compability tab
3. change the compatibilty mode to windows XP SP3, or 2 and also check the ""run as administrator"" box

NB: i have a dutch version of windows 7, so some of the terms may be slightly different
Hope it works!"
,joskip,2011-04-16T19:50Z,yes! it works!
,joskip,2011-04-16T20:41Z,...with thanks to filipinohero
