,asdqwezxc123,2007-04-25T07:54Z,"Just to make thigs clear, no i don't have it.

There was a seeder during the thanks post, but he disappeared after a while.

Atm those of us who still haven't lost hope are at 75%, so if you have it all, or even just 0.5% come back, maybe it's the pieces we don't have(seems like that happened when we jumped up from 71% after weeks of nothing)

Oh, and sorry about tripleposting :)"
,asdqwezxc123,2007-05-01T09:52Z,"Yay, quadposting :)
As of 19 Mar 2007 another martial angels torrent spawned on demonoid, and then mininova"
