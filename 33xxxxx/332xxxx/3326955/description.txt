Microsoft (Comic) Chat is a graphical IRC client that allows users to interact inside a comic strip and replaces the boring word of text with colorful graphics and creative avatars. 

This package contains color characters and backgrounds as well as updated servers and ability to play mp3 files. 

If you're into IRC or just looking for fun way to catch up with your mates; give it a go.
