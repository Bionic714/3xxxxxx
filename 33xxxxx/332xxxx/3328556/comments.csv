,vudoo408,2006-06-14T05:17Z,How many client can you use with this or is it the basic 5 CAL?
,vudoo408,2006-06-18T20:14Z,Looks like there's the RPC shutdown virus in here. I've tried to use both Enterprise and Work station and have problems. 
,sarath,2006-06-22T23:27Z,vudoo408 < Remove the internet connection from the machine when you install windows. Use a firewall when you connect to the net. The rpc virus will go away!

2. There is no description?

3. Does this has Service Pack 2 or is this R2?

nothing mentioned .. bad release. "

,dave359,2009-09-28T15:28Z,"awoliver - bin & cue files are a form of cd image - there should be 1 file that's about 1KB big & the other is about 700MB.

If you download PowerISO, you can use it to either extract the contents of the image or burn it straight to CD.  PowerISO's free to use.

Nero BurningROM might be able to read them depending on what version you have installed, but I prefer PowerISO since it supports quite a few different file formats."
,washingtonn2004,2009-10-26T03:08Z,"Hi, on the file ftf-2k3c.nfo.txt, you recommend ""Unrar (WinRAR 3 final) and burn with CDRwin/Discjuggler/Fireburner"".
Sorry, but does it make sense? Burning 3 O.S. in 1 CD? How will I choose Standard Edition?

I didn't understand that. So, I've extracted the file ftf-w2k3corp.bin using 7zip and burned ONLY the folder STD.
I've changed the boot order in the bios, but this CD won't boot.

Could you clarify it? I appreciate."
