,Elomiem,2006-11-21T20:23Z,"sorry,but i have to tell u that the qual is very bad.its not the bitrate..thats fine enough..but ALL the tracks  are skippy..some only somewhat but most are unlistenable due to very very skippy parts inbetween..
so,either make a reencode from the cd and listen to  em or pls remove the torrent as as its now its not worth it..much better versions around."
