These are unedited segments of the historic concert that was part of the Sideshows by the Seashore held on June 8, 1986 in Coney Island, NY. 

Improvisations and songs by Sun Ra and Cage's indeterminate performance vocals based on strict composition methods are contrasted and find a common meeting ground as, toward the end of the session, they play together. 

Fascinating and in genuine communal spirit.
