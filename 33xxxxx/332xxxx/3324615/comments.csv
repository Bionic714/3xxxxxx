,golfpack,2005-05-03T00:01Z,"This isnt ""2 fast 2 furious"" "
,zenki,2005-05-03T02:12Z,"its basicly a movie with cars running up and down a street, it is NOT a ""movie"" movie :)

but its fun if ur into cars"
,Grumpy_SWE,2005-05-03T13:42Z,"2 Fast 2 Real for Hollywood:
ThereÂ´s no time for ""lights, camera, action"" in this movie - itÂ´s just shoot and run! 2Fast2Real brings you the very latest (highly illegal!) street racing antics from America.

A DUKE car production."

,Twin_tip,2007-08-11T00:54Z,"2Fast2Real brings you bang up to date with the very latest street racing antics from America. The name speaks for itself:
2FAST? - 205 mph on a bike and a 150mph wheelie is way too fast for the street!
2REAL? - It's incredible what takes place on public streets: cops, tickets and more.
FOR HOLLYWOOD? No actor or film director could capture the raw drama and thrilling reality of street racing.
The film is packed with gut-wrenchingly fast racing including a burnout in Time Square! There are also police busts galore and lots and lots of delicious American honeyz to drool over!
It's fast, scary and very illegal - you have been warned!

Thanx for the upload, i hope that it will work.

SOMEONE THAT HAVE THE SECOND ONE ?
