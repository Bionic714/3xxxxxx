nice work BTW, i love japanese commercials (only)"
,Norvegia,2005-05-09T19:30Z,Why? I've always used that site to allocate my torrent's screenshots and so far so good.
,poipoipoi,2005-05-09T19:42Z,"once again a cool torrent!

but i wonder/ask/hope: could you seed an idols-only torrent, maybe? there's a bunch of CMs in here (like those baldness ones!) that, erm, suck! And a big pile of cute/hot idols would be really really popular, i suspect. :)

,BerugasLabor,2005-05-11T00:00Z,"hehe well this was pretty cool

in the xylitol commercial there are actually some finns in it, u hear ""kiitos"" in the beginning and then the wounderful finnish ""english"" :D

if ure into jdrama u might actually also recognise some japanese actors for example in
Chikinramen 1.avi, House.avi and Macadia.avi

gonna continue get this in the future, thanks man"
