Yamaha S-YXG50 Version 4 Windows XP with Registration key and Uninstaller

For the general user:
If you would like to improve the lousy quality of the MIDI sound that XP delivers with it's own software wavetable synthesizer, this application will do the job. Just let Yamaha S-YXG50 be your standard MIDI-player and the sound will be improved a lot.

For those who are more advanced (MIDI-savvy users, musicians, etc):
This award-winning application was suddenly discontinued by Yahama. Rumors are that this software was considered a threat to hardware sales. Well, if you still need it or have been having a hard time trying to find it: Here it is!
