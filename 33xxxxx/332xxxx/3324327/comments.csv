If this torrent was called ""Mexico..."" I'd expect maraichi versions, ""Germany..."" I'd expect either punk rock, electronica or maybe even polka, ""Scotland..."": break out he bagpipes.

Instead these are pretty standard cover versions of English language hit songs, with a wee bit of flemenco mixed in.  At least translate them to Portugeuse and wave that green, yellow and blue flag proudly.  I was expecting something like Seu Jorge's work from ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou""."
