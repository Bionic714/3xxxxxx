,Eron_Z,2005-05-07T07:24Z,"Been looking forward to this one.. All the whiners on the forums are complainin about bugs in the game, cry me a river....  Games like this dont get made too often, and a patch is in the works already to fix things.. I thought it had real potential, and if u like action RPG and aren't too damn picky about technical excellene and can have fun.. Then stay in line! This ones for you!

Oh, and go buy it if you like it, it's 39.99, and these kinda games really could use the support.."
,Sargan,2005-05-07T07:48Z,Please seed.
,idmmao,2005-05-07T08:07Z,"So given that I thought the demo was one of the least enjoyable things I've played in a very long time, is the game a lot better?"
,Eron_Z,2005-05-07T08:13Z,"If you didn't like the demo, I doubt you'd like the game in any shape or form..

So no."

,PiNNHEAD,2005-05-07T14:53Z,"I'm having problems starting the game, any one els having the same (you dubbell click on the icon, a black screen pops up, then poof, gone, nothing, zero, no nothing)?

Thanks"
,Hmmkk,2005-05-07T20:41Z,Hmm anyone tested this game? Looks okay on some screenshots and such I have seen... But is it like dungeon siege or is it just a wannabe rpg?
,catman4275,2005-05-07T21:08Z,"Theres a demo at www.dungeonlords.com.
Other than that, the game comes from the guy that did the Wizardry games.  Takes a bit to get used to, but way better than the original Dungeon Siege."

,KalleKofot,2005-05-08T06:18Z,"Really old school RPG, its 2005 not 1995. i rate this game 410, its not that good."
,prasopes,2005-05-08T10:09Z,Tmg3: Bullshit rars? lol - dont tell everyone how stupid little kid you are. Have you ever seen original release. Do you know anything about W-Scene. Oh I forgot... you dont care.
,koenigkroll,2005-05-08T10:19Z,"great prasopes. im proud of you for knowing about the ""w-scene"" what the fuck do we care and why the hell do we need the rars for. its not fucking irc you know"
,Palatini,2005-05-08T12:12Z,"Because when you spread a release - whatever release it might be - it's supposed to be in original form. Why? Because maybe people pass it on over DC och a FTP and having split archives in .rar makes life easier ->

If one .rar-archive is broken, it's not a whole .iso (650MB or fucking 4,7GB) Then you'll find a proper .rar instead of having to re-download everything.

Plus, a lot of the good DC-hubs out there, are .rar-only. Because people know this. You can .svf-check on the fly and you can ensure integrity and you don't fakeshare and ... bla bla

Get over that shit! - Rar - is good!

,Lelle6,2005-05-08T15:57Z,"Rar is good when u are using dc, yes.

 When u are using p2p its just crap, if its not compressed good. lol

Broken iso-file, mu ha ha ha ha ha. If the iso is broken, I would be glad if I didnt have to unpack it to notice that...

This is not dc and dc argument does not apply here."

Dungeon siege an rpg?? LOL"
,gathering,2005-05-08T17:43Z,"IF U GOR A BROKEN RAR.. THE ESAYEST WAY IS TO TRY ""REPAIR ARCHIVE""  IN WINRAR"
,djtrancer,2005-05-08T18:48Z,"The only reason you Rar haters wanna have it unpacked is because you are to lacy and you don't have space on your HDD..
I say, get bent and clean your HDD from crap..
Why do you wanna re-download over 700mb when you only need to download 14mb if it's corrupted..
You rar haters have no stable comment on why it's bad :P

RAR files are great!"
,Bwii,2005-05-08T19:30Z,"I have one bad comment about rar's, and many good, but I really dont like rared things, because it takes 15-20 min to unpack it. I wanna have my downloads ready to be played directly after downloaded.

On the other hand you know it's the proper release and no spyware or viruses or other crap in it. But I still hate it because i'm lazy and dont wanna unpack things all the time. =)"
,Strict,2005-05-08T19:40Z,"The main reason why I want games and movies as unpacked torrents are that I'm not sharing packed ones due to the space it takes, I'm sharing over 26 gigs atmo (out of 200 gigs on the list of shares) if I would have shared packed things I'd have to have a double-sized harddrive.

= when I download something I unpack it and delete the compressed archives to save space."
,KangaRoO,2005-05-08T21:27Z,"Thank you for this game
<3 the Rar's much better, so if we get a bad file, its easy'er to download 50 mb than 700 Mb :D

Bahh on the advertisement post's. If its good enough for us, we will find it our selfs :D"
,Salisha,2005-05-08T22:44Z,"worst piece of shit game ever, im a rpg fan and this was for sure top 3 worst rpg's i ever played"
,blaze7,2005-05-09T00:08Z,"rar packed is good, here is a tip unzip, install, crack than delete iso or burn it. If you run out of space buy another HDD or burn some backups for a change."
,Phunkyfella,2005-05-09T04:40Z,"Ok. Get past the kinda serious bug issues and at heart this is a good game. Trust me. I nearly binned it 5 mins after dl but if you give it a short while it might grow on you. Just to say it is chocca bloc of bugs.. No automap, no character adaptation etc. Not flaming this release btw. Its the way the devs etc have released it. Just a warning. Hope it helps."

,AhmenHabek,2005-05-09T12:45Z,"Just to add ->

Although this game for you may be shit. People has different tastes. The rating system is there so you can rate how reliable the torrent is, not your tastes of the game.

So if it works. Rate is 4 or 5. If you dont like the game and rate 1 then fuck you. It will make people not want to download it."

They used the same magic all the time, 
all characters had the same weapons... 
everything looked so damn monotous..
Maybe the company just sucks on making trailers, otherwise the game must really suck..."

It should answer any questions here re. quality etc. of the game.

NB. This is the full game. There are things printed in the manual not implemented ingame. Welcome to the ""pay to Beta test"" era of gaming."
