I allafall:
----------------------------------------------------------
IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0376538/
Genre: Horror
User Rating:1.7/10
User Comments: Well, it could have been worse...
at least it wasn't boring. The affects were fair to poor for a micro-budget film. The extras on the DVD were okay, but I was disappointed that there wasn't a commentary. It was short, and appropriately cheesy. It just didn't sing. Nothing sparked. Its just an average little indy horror flick. Many of Sub Rosa's other efforts are better.
