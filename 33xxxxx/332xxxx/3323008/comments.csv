,rhebult,2006-03-06T18:39Z,is there any chance that you can reseed the first seasons with all the subs?
,petsel,2006-06-13T10:36Z,Maybe when Im done with season 7
,Tyfon,2006-06-19T05:28Z,"hmm .. donÂ´t seem to get all DS9 Disks when I search. only the first releases .. 

meening only up to s1d6 from your great release Petsel.

Anyone got a clue why that might be ?"
,Swashbuckling_Matey,2006-06-23T05:40Z,Hey petsel great work!  I'm wondering if you're continuing to seed the rest of ds9.. the last disc I saw was before the bay was down ;) and it was S5D3 I believe.  Are you still posting or is there a bug with pirate bay?  The search only comes up with season 1 discs...
