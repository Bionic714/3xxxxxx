One of the best recent records by British jazz genius Stan Tracey -- recorded with a strong group that also includes alto great Peter King, one of the UK's best jazz talents of the postwar years. The tracks are relatively straight ahead and hard swinging -- which is a real relief after Tracey's "too free" recordings of the mid and late 70s. Titles include "Newk's Fluke", "Rocky Mount", "One For Gil", and "Clinkscales".
