Three notorious gangsters wage a bloody battle for supremacy 
in the City of Brotherly Love. Beans, the imprisoned kingpin 
and hometown drug lord, struggles to keep his renegade ABM 
Crime Syndicate on the map. He is driven and consumed by a 
festering hatred for his longtime rival. Dame, the Harlem-born 
hustler, is also the top dog in town. His Umbrella network is 
unmatched in cash-flow and manpower. With a long list of 
enemies seeking territory and revenge, the self-proclaimed 
&quot;cakeaholic&quot; is forced into a vicious war. Loco, the flashy 
Miami playboy, is about to be released from prison. His deep 
pockets and stellar reputation prove to be valuable tools in 
Loco's plot to take over the streets of Philly. But he must 
first overcome the ghosts from a turbulent past. Alliances are 
formed and shattered, and lifelong friendships are put to the 
test as the various crews deal and duel to the death. 
Somewhere, buried deep within the ranks of one of these gangs, 
a ruthless criminal mastermind is conspiring to take them all 
down. The backstabbing, thievery and deception simmers, boils 
and ultimately spills into a gruesome finale--an old-fashioned 
shootout on the cold, unforgiving Philly streets.
