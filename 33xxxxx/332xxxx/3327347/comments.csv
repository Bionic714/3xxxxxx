,greenman1867,2007-12-28T17:20Z,Great video quality mostly except....several of the episodes have problems with Audio/Video Sync. The lips are moving and the words come 1-2 seconds later. Very annoying.
,Randy Orton,2008-02-05T14:03Z,Can somebody upload tru calling season 2? I've heard there should be like two episodes on it
,baby_shamble,2008-02-07T06:24Z,"thanks a lot))
if you have season 2, could you upload it too?"
,chpich,2008-04-24T17:52Z,"thanks for releasing this, i only had video/sound syc problems with episodes 2 & 3, rest were fine.

a slightly awkward solution to the sync problem is to play 2 instances of the same episode, turn the volume down on the one you're watching and use the other for the sound, and sync it manually with pause/play.

anyway will seed this for a while, suprisingly good show and worth the dl."
,Smiagol,2008-09-30T19:59Z,Seed plz! very low download speed.. (10kb/sec)

,Thomps6o,2011-03-27T08:41Z,btw everyone has a problem with audio matching up with video on VLC player.....SWITCH to CCCP already! which is pretty much MPC with all codecs!
