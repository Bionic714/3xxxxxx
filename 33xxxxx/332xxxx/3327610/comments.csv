,tomwatt,2005-05-10T22:47Z,"Is it just me, or does any one else have a problem running this game? As I start the game, it changes screen resolution, and jumps straight back to desktop. Game is still running, and I can hear music. Might sound like a spec. problem, but if I can play Doom3, I should be able to play this??"
,Erfa,2005-05-12T15:41Z,"Read the NFO?

1. Unpack (several times)
2. Run SPiTFiRE.bat (yeah, do it!)
3. Accept registry entries (no problem?)
4. Start the game with TabloidTycoon.exe (easy?)
5. Enjoy! (I hope you do...)

And I have no idea whera to find a crack... you can try:

Good luck! :)"
,Erfa,2005-05-13T18:01Z,"You have WinRAR right?

Mark all the .zip-files, right click and select ""Unpack Here"" or whatever. Now you get a directory (Tabloid) with some .c**-files and one .ace-file. Open the .ace-file with WinRAR and unpack to ""C:/Program Files/Tabloid Tycoon"" or something (this will be the game folder). Then go to the folder and run ""SPiTFiRE.bat"". This will install the files. When it ask you for registry entries, accept it.

Run ""Tabloid Tycoon.exe"", or whatever it's called, to play the game. Good luck!"
