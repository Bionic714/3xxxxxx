,looper23,2005-05-04T19:03Z,Thanks for the release man but a question - Is this the same as the one that can be downloaded from the Adobe servers (600kb/s) or is it something different? Some more info. would be nice!
[T],Peterq,2005-05-04T19:16Z,"I'm not sure, is the honest answer!
In the intro it says that the files are on CD2 of the retail release, but if you got your Photoshop via ESD then the Video Workshop can be purchased (via ESD) from totaltraining.com (or similar) I got it via FTP from a buddy!
A commenter on the previous torrent I posted said he/she couldn't find it on adobe.com
I'd be interested to know myself if it can be downloaded from a fast server - save me a whole lotta bandwidth!!
