OK, so here are some promo and live videos from a couple of really good Polish punk bands (Dezerter, KSU, Sedes and Siekiera).
This is fucking great music so give'em a chance.

Check the torrent for track list, and before you wine about only wanting a few of them, get a decent BitTorrent client and grab them yourself from this :)

More like this would be appreciated if anyone got some laying around :D
