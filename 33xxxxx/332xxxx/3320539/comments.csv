,thePl4gue,2008-07-10T14:28Z,"I downloaded this a while ago. BAD quality. Most of the songs had INCORRECT TITLES, some of the songs had some modifications, like Butterfly: Dance! from One of 18 Angels had some asshole-inserted piano part at the end, as well as one of the songs from Psychoma.

The hours I spent fixing these issues made me realize it's easier to buy the music than get this torrent. It doesn't matter if you don't have this, fuck this torrent. Besides, don't download this music if you won't buy it. Here's what the leader of the group said about stealing music:

""I just find it very difficult to look in the future and see how a lot of my music friends and I are supposed to survive from what we do because, unlike what many people think, doing music is not like working 3 hours a day. We have a lot of work; we work more that usual employed people.""

""...I 'm not complaining about this at all, I 'm very comfortable with the work I do and I chose it and I enjoy it. But I think people are stealing my existence, they?re stealing my basis and they?re stealing my future. And they do this to everybody, so I don't know how this is supposed to compensate at some point, I don't know what is going to come up that will bring us the money that we use during the cds

I don't know this, nobody really knows. But digital sales surely will not compensate the physical sales. They are just little bonus but they will never replace physical sales."""
