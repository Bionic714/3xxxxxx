    Game Notes:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~

    Yager captures your imagination as you battle for your life in
    tomorrow's hostile skies. But is it all what it seems...? Keep
    your wits about you, and use what you learn, as your struggle
    evolves to become the fight against constitutional power,
    conspiracy and control. With the genre-busting mix of 3D
    action-adventure and air combat, coupled with the highly
    motivating storyline and nail-biting campaigns, Yager is next
    generation gaming at its finest.

    In single-player-mode widely varied missions deriving from the
    context of a thrilling plot, breathtaking 3D-action and elements
    of adventure will create a unique atmosphere you can hardly escape.
    You'll become the key figure in a complex science fiction story.
    The storyline evolves as you advance, letting the characters you
    meet respond to your actions and behaviour.

    You play as Magnus Tide, fighter pilot. Your mission is to survive.
    Win life-threatening dogfights against top aces, infiltrate enemy
    hiding places, race at speed through the skies against outlaws in
    their highly tuned machines, dive and attack your enemies... There
    are furious battles to be fought. You will need skill, stealth and
    sheer guts. Have you got what it takes? Do you accept the challenge?

    Additional information:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    It's easy to say that clean images go to iso sites and ripped
    releases go to 0day sites, but this has already been blurred
    out in i.e. the movie scene and console scene. An iso
    image, ripped from a dvd, doesn't belong on rip sites. The
    game developers have given us a couple of DVD releases
    already, and this isnt the last time they will pick DVD
    as medium over CDs. As natural evolution brought us
    releases on CDs, they have brought us releases on DVDs. 
    
    Ripping DVD games to CDs is a step of this evolution, and
    both the groups and the site will have to adjust. MYTH realizes
    this, and hereby brings you its first DVDrip. Enjoy!

    We do this just for FUN. We are against any profit or commercialisation
    of piracy. We do not spread any release, others do that.
    In fact, we BUY all our own games with our own hard earned and worked for
    efforts. Which is from our own real life non-scene jobs.
    As we love game originals. Nothing beats a quality original.

    If you like this game, BUY it. We did!
