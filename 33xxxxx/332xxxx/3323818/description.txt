Ah, Nerf Herder – long the cutesy masters of cuddly dorkcore. The makers of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer theme music. The singers of an over-the-top ode to Van Halen. So cuddly, funny and nice, who couldn’t love them?

Your mom, probably, if there hadn’t been a considerable amount of censorship and/or restraint in the band’s formative years, as My EP shows. A collection of unreleased tracks that the now defunct My Records originally released, Honest Don’s scratches up another four songs and re-releases this out-of-print collection. You’ll never look at Nerf Herder the same again.

The band still features its distinctly dorky sound. Singer Parry Gripp’s delivery is still as whiney as a freshman stuffed in a gym locker, and the band’s light pop punk was never meant to do more than carry a bubblegum melody as a backdrop for the band’s silly tales. This time around, however, the act’s not nearly a bunch of goofs much as a horde of frustrated computer nerds. Sexual content is upped considerably: Check “Love Sandwich” for a not-so-subtle tune about a threesome, “Fight For Your Right To Masturbate” rips the Beasties as well as Internet porn, and “I’ve Got a Boner For Christmas” smacks of The Vandals without either Nerf Herder’s wit or the Vandals’ snottiness. Other tracks cover vital topics such as paying homage to a sports bar (“The Sportsmen Bar”) and, cliché of all clichés, reveling in celebrity crushes (“Nikki Webster”).
