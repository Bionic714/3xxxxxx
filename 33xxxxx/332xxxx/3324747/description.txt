For years, the Psychonauts have deployed their psychically-armed    operatives all over the world, but this time trouble is brewing right    in their own backyard. Someone is abducting students from the Psychonaut    boot camp - a deranged scientist who only wants their brains. One cadet    a mysterious and powerful new arrival named Raz - stands alone against    the lunatic. Raz must develop and unleash an arsenal of paranormal    powers, including telekinesis, firestarting, clairvoyance, and his most    powerful weapon of all - the ability to launch himself telepathically    into someone else's mind, and run around in the demented amusement park    of their imagination. Raz takes on their inner demons face to face,    wrestles with their nightmares, and digs up their secret memories.    Ultimately he must enter the mind of his worst enemy and destroy his    dark plans at their source, while trying not to lose his sanity in the    process.
