And for the last time people!: No sane person would rar or zip a movie so it makes no sense to download one either."
,T33,2005-05-08T12:10Z,My gaaawwwd! Over 200 stupid leechers downloading this shit....
,larscifer,2005-05-08T13:53Z,"That`s what happen when the Penis starts to ""think"" and the brain shuts down.....how fuckin`dumb can one get???? 
This shit is apparently full of virus. But on the other side, if you`re so friggin` stupid, downloading this, you deserve it."
,Stianu89,2005-05-08T17:29Z,"haha!!! this isnt a virus ""noob"" its just zipped in an auto archive. pleace check things b4 u comment gorillapappa!
"
,buda911,2005-05-14T17:54Z,"Even if it is in a self-extracting archive, I'm still not going to download it.  There is no point in wasting your time putting it in an archive.  If you actualy want people to download it and trust it, just post the raw .avi or .mpg file and leave it at that. "
,MongaNOR,2005-06-28T18:34Z,"T33:
iff you download this, you're a ""stupid leecher"" too ;)
think about it

I agree with Gorillapappa, packing media files is completely useless!"
