,flow_o0,2005-04-23T20:30Z,"
first of all I would like to say hi and thanks to all the help I got from you people.

Yes i made it work and I will tell you how!!

1.open up the FIRST Cd1 winrar archive and unpack all the files. *** here is problem 1. in the first archive there is only one file named: car-str1.bin but there should be 2 files, one .bin and one .cue. so you unpack the .bin and close the FIRST winrarr archive. Then you open up the LAST winrar archive, there you should find the .cue file. Unpack it***

2.open up the FIRST Cd2 winrar archive and unpack all the files.***here is problem 2.in the First archive there is only   three files .BWA  .BWT  .BWI, unpack and close the FIRST archive. Now you open up the LAST winrar archive and find  the last missing file the  .BWS, unpack it***

3.Mount the .BIN file from Cd1 into Daemon tools and then  you mount .BWT from Cd2 into Daemon tools and instal the game.

4.download and instal Anti-Blaxx (you can find a direct download in a former post). Right-click on the systemtray icon of Anti-blaxx and turn on Intelligent stealth. the go into settings and: In GENERAL SETTINGS you input the daemon.exe. then you press the first game button and proceed , In PROTECTION you choose securom7.
In GAME you input the INSTALLED stronghold.exe and name it whatever you want. If a window pops up telling you that ""no protection was found, select it on your own"" 
you ignore it and click the button close. 

5.Now you should have mounted both images; .BIN for cd1 and .BWT from cd2. (all the options off in daemon tools)
Now you right click thesystemtray icon on anti-blaxx and remove intelligent stealth. then you re-right click the icon and press run game then the name you named it before.

There you go. a complete guide to starting Stronghold 2. 

ps. I have collected all the info from posters before me. and if you wonder I am ffrom sweden, And say thanks =)"

,pk_vercetti,2005-07-18T05:02Z,"SH2_DISC2.ISO

PASTE THIS ON THE BWI FILE. CHANGE .BWI to .ISO 


this is very important to make the cd2 work!

all the other files of cd2 wich is [Multilingual][CD2][www.pctorrent.com].BWS
and [Multilingual][CD2][www.pctorrent.com].BWA 
and [Multilingual][CD2][www.pctorrent.com].BTW is to be renamed to 


SH2_DISC2.BWA
SH2_DISC2.BTW
SH2_DISC2.BWS


if you do all this do the next step:


Mount in alcohol 120%'s virtual driver:

[Multilingual][CD2][www.pctorrent.com].cue

when the setup ask for cd 2 mount:
SH2_DISC2.ISO

the file you have allereddy renamed.


finish the install.

,tikki6,2007-10-21T19:48Z,"Bobolino, i'll just answer on both in one answer....
What you have to do is to download and install Daemon Tools. Thereafter you right-click the Daemon tools icon on your bottom windows bar (dunno what it's called... The place where MSN are displayed....) Then scroll over Virtual CD/DVD-Rom .... Now there should be an option saying Device 0: [Disc Drive letter here] No media.... Scroll over that and press Mount Image. Now you browse the .cue (or .bin not sure for this torrent, try both) file. It should start Autorun (otherwise just go to ""My Computer"" and start it from there... Now install it. You'll probably need a crack, if it isn't included (no clue, haven't downloaded this). After you fixed the crack (download it from www.gamecopyworld.com and replace it with your other .exe file....) start the game, and you're playing :) Good luck"

,Shadeux,2010-08-27T06:34Z,"Ok. It took me forever to get this game to work. I mean FOREVER. I don't consider myself a n00b, but I sure felt like one. So I'm going to explain to you guys what I did to get the game to work. But first, I want to say thanks to the pctorrent for uploading this torrent. Ok, ready to play? 

1. This is version 1.00. The 1.4.1 patch WILL NOT work with this version. So what to do:

2. I'm using Daemon Tools Lite. (I'm sure others will work). Click the name with [CD1] in it. (Usually the first one). A dialog box SHOULD pop up. Click ""Autorun.exe""

3. Install the program as you usually would. After a while it will ask for disk 2. Here's where I had trouble. Go back to Daemon Tools to mount the second disk. BUT DON'T MOUNT YET! On the bottom right-hand corner of the box, there will be a drop-down menu that reads ""All Supported Types"" You'll want to click that, and go to the very bottom and select ""All Filles"" Mount the [CD2] file that ends in .bwi. For me, it was the 3rd one down. Once the disc is mounted, click ok in the installation to finish. 

4. As I said before, this is Version 1.00. So go to http://us4.strategyinformer.com/v2/download/12a97813/unsorted%2Fstronghold2_v1.1_update_us.exe to download the 1.1 patch. Install and if it asks to reboot, then reboot. 

5. Almost there. We can install 1.4 (not 1.4.1) from version 1.1. Go to http://173.192.153.174/filehell/cc3d7839da5b8a6c63d704c86826e6344c8070aa00520e/patch/stronghold2_v1_4_update.zip to update to 1.4. Install. I didn't have to reboot here. 

6. NOW you can finally update to 1.4.1. Go to http://us5.strategyinformer.com/v2/download/26bb39fa/stronghold2%2Fstronghold2_v1_41_update.zip to update to the final patch. Install. 

7. No, you can't still run the game without a CD. So go to http://d10.gamecopyworld.com/?r=pc_stronghold_2&c=20664&d=2007&f=htd-sh24!rar to download the no-cd patch. NOTE: Make a back up of your original Stronghold.exe file before you patch ""just in case""

8. Now run the game. When the game runs, it will say that if has found an update. DO NOT UPDATE!! I tried, and then it asked for a CD. 

9. Enjoy the game! I hope I covered everything. I know this is lengthy, but wanted to help others. Thanks again to the uploader!!"
,coulter47,2010-10-05T03:30Z,WTF IS MOUNTING!!!!! NOOB PLZ HELP
,Shadeux,2010-10-23T09:46Z,"@coulter47 I'm sorry. I should have mentioned more clearly how to mount. So here it is:

1. Download Daemon Tools Lite from http://www.disc-tools.com/download/daemon The download button is kinda small and is usually above the big ad on the right. 

2. Install it. After it's installed, there should be an icon in your system tray. That's the area by the clock. In Windows 7, you might have to click the arrow to see it. Single click the icon. 

3. A prompt will come up. Click the option that says ""No Media"" On mine, it says Device0 :[E:] No Media. 

4. Once you click that, a window will pop up. Just browse to where you downloaded, and click the folder with [CD1] in the file name. Then follow the directions in my previous post. 

Hope that solves it for you. If not, I will try to make a video for ya and post it on youtube. Don't be afraid to ask me anything!"
