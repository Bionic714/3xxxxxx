,Deadmanse,2005-05-03T03:34Z,"xc0d3- is right. Just take a visit to the games official site at: http://www.lasersquadnemesis.com/
Before it was a multiplayer only, but this release has solo play.
Btw, its made by the guys behind the awesome classic X-Com UFO Defense/UFO: Enemy Unknown :D"
,CombatSanta,2005-05-03T19:32Z,anyone played lasersquad on the Amiga 500 ?
,uffe666,2005-05-18T02:02Z,Ja jag undrar oxå hur man öppnar dessa filer ?                How can i open these files ?                                             Det första LaserSquad kom på 80 talet till Vic 64 an. Jag spelade det då och tyckte då att det var det bästa spel som fanns.Tror det bara var 5-6 scenarios plus ett random men man kunde spela mot polarna ! vilket inte var vanligt på den tiden.
