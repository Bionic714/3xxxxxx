                      LASER SQUAD NEMESIS                       
          Laser Squad Nemesis is a squad level strategy game.         
            You pick the map, scenario, race and then compose your
        squad by spending 'Force Points'. You can play the           
            single player campaign missions against a devious
            computer opponent, or play online against other players
            from around the world. At last you can play a game of
            pure strategy that leaves tired old RTS formulas behind.
            With 15-30 units a side, Laser Squad Nemesis gives you
            plenty of control for you to develop ingenious tactics
            and clever strategies.
