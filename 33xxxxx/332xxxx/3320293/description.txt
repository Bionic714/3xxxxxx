Diplomats Of Solid Sound

Instrumental Lounge Music. A good listener this one is.



There comes a time in every band’s life where independence from the past must be declared. Ah-ha!, The Diplomats already did that with their debut “Instrumental Action Soul”, but the natural reaction to dust off your Booker T records to test out the tried-and-true influences line will likely be there just the same. Don’t waste your time! The Diplomats are way passed the point of simply homaging the past. These guys are jamming out a hybrid of the re-fried greasy southern soul-funk-du-jour with a healthy side of New Orleans street band vibe courtesy of Jim Viner’s outstanding drum work.
