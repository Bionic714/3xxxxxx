,mac_davis,2007-02-21T00:13Z,"This is my favorite book series I have ever read, and I do believe it is the best ever written, along with the sister novels. I give it the highest recommendation if you can't get a hardback copy of the books. Be warned that The Gunslinger is kind of boring the first time."
,crooklyn,2007-03-18T18:51Z,SWEET.  thank you.
,nightsongz2,2007-05-06T18:05Z,We've gotten so lazy that people have to have their books read TO them now. 
,fiveironfan248,2007-05-30T11:02Z,"I'm having trouble getting this torrent.  I'm running WinXP sp2 and the original bit torrent client.  When I try opening this torrent, it says I have too many files open.  Something about ermo24 error.  Can anyone help?  Thanks."
,TheEndSmiles,2007-07-14T06:44Z,Can anybody tell me what the quality is like on these files?
,Lusin,2007-07-31T11:19Z,"You say True, I say Thank you"
,Arcane_Warrior,2007-07-31T23:49Z,"The first six books were very good, with some segments among the best Stephen King has ever written, but here is my advice:
In book 7, Stephen King cuts in to say (more or less) ""This is a good place to stop, if you want a happy ending"".  LISTEN TO HIM.  Book 7 was good up until that point.  After that, he ruined the entire Dark Tower series.  The end of Dark Tower is good only for masochists.  Stop listening when Stephen tells you to stop."
[T],data9724,2008-03-08T12:14Z,"Just a warning, there are several flaws in this audio bookk, i was not sure at the start, i figured i had just not paid attention, but missed stuff like the poem Jake wrote in book 3, but when i reached book 4, the showdown with Blaine was missing the last half.
Im not sure a better version exist, but ill reccomend getting the other torrents for these books instead, in case they are complete."
,peewii16,2009-03-10T03:12Z,thankya big big for all i wish you Long Days and pleasent nights
,the_gunslinger,2009-06-11T19:52Z,"Mark me well,

In the fourth book of the recording, 'Wizard and Glass', part of the tale is missing, whereby the ka-tet defeats Blaine, the mad demon train.

Those readers who are left bereft of this part of the story, as was I, may find solace in the preview of 'Wizard and Glass' that is available from Google Books, at 

http://books.google.com/books?id=FYr98rTnWP0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=wizard+and+glass#PPP1,M1

Long days and pleasant nights, my strong of phrase and errant knights."
