,oblodo,2005-04-29T18:15Z,"Rare Trailer.....................Hahahahahahahah.. its just as rare as Paris Hilton videos..... moron... torrent of this... u must be joking. But than again, i guess u are so young, that u never even was born for the first SW movie........

I guess your parents told u they rarely fuck.. ( only once.. when they made u)........ And since u see em, go at it every night... u think rare means often....... and aboundant

ahahahahahahahahahhaahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha"
,Shikome,2005-04-29T18:27Z,"@ above comment:
And you are how old ?
Only ones that Ive seen make comments like that are people with no manners nor ""age"".
Go troll somewhere else please.

Thanks for trailer."
,CHEEZOR2,2005-04-29T21:44Z,Awesome Trailer. Thanks.
,jonez,2005-04-29T22:40Z,"ok oblodo,

first of all, I didn't rename the trailer, i posted it as I got it, I don't usually rename stuff (posting tags, titles, etc)

second of all, learn how to spell before you try to insult someone as you just made a complete fool out of yourself

third of all,  not everyone watches their parents fuck at night like you do, i'm sorry but the world doesn't evolve around you and your sick hobbies.

get a life.

,aDDreeÉ,2005-05-09T11:20Z,DONT WASTE TIME ON TRAILERS YOU FUCKS  GET DA REAL MOVIE  THEN WE L TALK
,jonez,2005-05-09T16:41Z,"if you're not going to download the trailer, go post somewhere else.

some people actually like to see a preview of the movie...it makes the suspense greater."
,The_Same,2005-05-10T22:55Z,"i can't see why they have to post anything if they don't like it.
if you don't like it and won't download it, shut up!"
,greenaway50,2005-05-11T19:53Z,"3.39min long,i wish it could be longer.i have never seen this trailer before,it was excellent,i can not wait for the film."
,zigen,2005-05-13T21:31Z,"Ok..heres the deal..why download the trailer when u can have the full movie.....ok i dont know the URL (im sorry for that) but i assure you all...the sw episode 3 is on google....just search after Star Wars Episode 3 revenge of the sith bittorrent and you´ll get it, i think it was the 8:th link......."
,GloomyDan,2005-05-14T01:31Z,"Say what..?
Tried googleing the recommended line - no torrent :("
,jonez,2005-05-17T18:06Z,"I've gotten multiple reports that Star Wars episode III is a fake!  It's some documentary on something else totally unrelated to stars wars.

Download that movie at your own risk."
,jonez,2005-05-19T20:26Z,"ok, the newest star wars episode III release it real.  from what i've heard, it's a screener and in fairly good condition."
