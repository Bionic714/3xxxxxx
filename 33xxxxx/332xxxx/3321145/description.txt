Sorry for the english

Sound Blaster Platnium 2 EX (breakout box) drivers.

New pollicy of Creative says that drivers from there downloadsite require the orginal install cd.

(so if you don't have the cd you need to buy a new one, $10 or something)

This cd supports 3 versions of the Platnium 2.

Instructions

Extract with winrar and mount or burn the image.
After that check the Creative update site and look for the auto update fuction.

Goodluck.

Upload seems horrible today...
