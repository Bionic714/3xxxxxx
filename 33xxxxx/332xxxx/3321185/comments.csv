This is the worst movie in the historie.

How it got 7.3 on IMDB is a mystery.

The film has nothing -its not funny(not even once), its just plain simple booooring.

,tangled,2005-04-25T14:39Z,"Förra årets bästa film! Av någon anledning tycker samtliga idioter (inklusive Fredrik Virtanen, givetvis...) hemskt illa om den.

Det görs för lite intelligenta komedier nuförtiden, se till att inte missa den här!"

,freakinidiot,2005-04-28T08:56Z,"I think worst movie in history is a little crazy, even if you do not like the movie.  Its hilarious."
,shogge,2005-06-29T15:14Z,start seeding ? i download 2kb/s and upload 55kb/s !!
,Hobbes_maxwell,2006-04-24T10:47Z,"worst movie in history? wow, maybe if your retarded or something and can't handle comedy AND drama simultaniously...

seriously, this movie is one of the best i've seen in a long time. bill murry gives a great perfomance, and the story is top notch."
,jthm83,2006-12-31T21:30Z,Somebody please seed!
,stewartdc8,2007-07-25T17:51Z,99.5!!! Somebody please seed!
,Jwitt5,2008-12-16T19:01Z,"that's why it's so funny, because it's not supposed to be."
,forgetclosure,2009-11-24T02:38Z,"i'm hoping this is a good upload, but there's 5 leechers stuck at 83%, and no one seeding..

does anyone on tpb seed anymore..?"
,forgetclosure,2009-11-28T08:32Z,"i hate bitching for seeds, but i've been waiting for a little over a week now and there's 7 leechers stuck at 83%.."
,forgetclosure,2009-11-28T20:58Z,"thanks, i'll be sure to seed to a good ratio"
,forgetclosure,2009-11-30T05:59Z,"why'd you stop seeding? now we're all waiting at 87% instead of 83%...
do you have some mental deficiency or something?
there's 9 people waiting for 200mb and you can't seed for ten minutes to one leech so we can all download it?
thanks..."
