Short Explanation:
1. OK quality will make you want to by the DVD's
2. Quality is nearly as good as the XVID format but with a 1/3 the size.
350K RMVB file  = 110MB
XVID file = 250MB

Long Explamation:
First off I feel that if you want the highest quality go buy the DVDs. Secondly I find that Real Media Variable Rate files offer quality that is about 95% as good as a divx file. The difference is that the 45 minute divx file has a size of 350MB. Where as a RMVB file endcoded at 350KB is only 110MB. Since storage is at a premium for me the repack saves my disk space. This format is good for those who prefer it and/or need smaller files.

If you're are wondering what happened to the torrent it will be avaiable as of monday."
