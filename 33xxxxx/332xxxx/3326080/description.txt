Since mischa is having problems with his DVD-burner (was that right?), I'm putting this one up myself.
After a lot of searching on DC hubs, I finally found ONE person who had this one (thanks, Syndikhat).
The last two DVDs will follow, provided that the previously mentioned person doesn't remove them before I've finished downloading them.

As I don't know how long I will be able to keep my computer and connection running (I might be going away for a while), I ask all of you to keep your torrents up after you finished downloading - seed! Not only will this make more people happy, it will also make me able to use my space and bandwidth for more important things; downloading and seeding the two final DVDs to all of you. :)

The specifications are as follows:

Video: PAL, Re-encoded
Extras: Untouched
Menu: Untouched
Audio: English
Subtitles: English, Swedish, Italian


A final thanks to mischa who uploaded the previous DVDs of this fantastic series. If you (or anyone else) by any chance are able to upload the final two discs before I do, you are more than welcome!

If you get something for free and you can keep giving it for free, making other people happy, without loosing anything - why shouldn't you? Keep seeding! :}
