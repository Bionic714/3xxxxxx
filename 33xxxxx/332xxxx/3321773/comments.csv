,heson,2005-04-26T09:54Z,"Click on ""[Se lista]"" to see the contents of the torrent. And it looks like a collection of episode. "
,p4c3,2005-04-27T23:28Z,"Thank you very much for this upload!
I've been trying to get hold of a torrent with season 1. If you have it, can you please upload it? Thx"
,Nick4753,2005-06-05T04:54Z,"There is no DVD out of Season 2, so no... this is not a DVD Rip. HD rip possibly."
,SacRe,2005-06-12T18:41Z,"This isn't season 2, it's a mix up of season 1. -_-;"

,LezDawson,2008-12-03T00:12Z,"What a shit rip, in a crap format (i.e. not avi).
And not genuinely season 2.
Useless waste of space!"
,LezDawson,2009-01-13T18:08Z,"Also aspect ratio is bad.  Whoever ripped this wants shooting in the kneecaps.
FUCK YOU IN THE NECK!"
,rancidcrab,2009-12-21T01:44Z,"LezDawson,

I upped it, but I didn't rip it.

Look at the up-date you fuck-tard. I compiled this from torrents I downloaded when they were fresh... meaning pre-DVD you schmuck.  

I noticed the episodes were not available fairly soon after they were released and I decided to do something about it.  

I reposted the episodes I had downloaded from others to ensure other fans had access.

How many of your torrents are four or more years old? As of today, none, that's how many.

You can try to fuck me in the neck... if you think you're man enough that is.

Fuck off hater."
