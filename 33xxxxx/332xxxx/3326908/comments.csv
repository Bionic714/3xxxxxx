,LazyD,2006-06-25T00:00Z,"Surely this is why others are experiencing the cab file errors on installation and burning. I tried to uncompress the iso to check if the missing files were irrelevant, but no, won't uncompress properly.

I wonder why some users clients are letting them finish when it's incomplete while mine (uTorrent bty) never finishes?

Can anyone help with this? Or point those of us with problems to an Office torrent that is known to finish properly recently.

Thanks, sorry bout the longness!"
,LazyD,2006-06-25T02:25Z,"Ok, it worked eventually. I think it was something to do with my client. I deleted the torrent file and redownloaded it, forced a re-check, it finished, burned and installed fine, lovely jubly.

I think the others are having the same problem, ie, it's not fully downloaded when it says it is, try what I did, and a different client if that don't work, force re-check."

,cellularmobile,2008-10-18T00:06Z,"OK, I was recently doing a clean up of my pc and apparantly I deleted something I shouldn't have and now when ever I do anything MS related it tries to run the install and such. I fuggured i could use the start up disk to repair it but the disk is no where to be found...

So I torented this and have mounted the .iso to DEAMON tools and ran ""Install Microsoft Office Professional Edition 2003"" and chose to do a repair. It starts fine but when it gets to where the Current Action reads: 
""Copying new files
Copying file: STOCKS.DAT""

It stops and asks me to ""please insert the disk: Microsoft Professional Edition 2003"" and I thought having the disk image mounted on DEAMON would have that covered...
What am I doing wrong?

Thank you for any help in advance."
