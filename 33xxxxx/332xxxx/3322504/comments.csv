Trivia: The movie was renamed in the Soviet Union, because 'black hole' is an obscene term in Russian."

,LetsRockit01234,2009-10-11T17:33Z,"the black bars are because it is the wide screen version, I would rather have the full screen version"
,blackleotard,2009-11-26T01:18Z,"""I would rather have the full screen version.""

Have you tried sitting closer to the screen?  That way you get the full screen version, plus some extra bits at the side, too."
,whraglyn,2010-06-01T02:37Z,"@blackleotard:
'Have you tried sitting closer to the screen?'
The sad thing is those who want to see a 'full' movie on a 'full' screen will NEVER get that fine line!
'That way you get the full screen version, plus some extra bits at the side, too.'
roflmao at your dry Brit wit! have you ever seen Kevin Kline's 'Ugly American' Otto in 'A Fish Called Wanda'? gotta check it out, dude!
THX to UL and seeders!

,mohiergauth,2011-04-03T06:06Z,"Subs, search for this : THE BLCAK HOLE.SRT duh.....or better yet, learn English, like the rest of the world wanker!"
,mohiergauth,2011-04-03T06:09Z,"XD Anyone who would rather have full screen is a complete idiot. You do realize that your missing like 1/3 of the film yeah? Or maybe your IQ is only 85 and your too stupid to realize that LETTERBOX is actually a theatrical version?

Yeah the human state is rather sad."
,repetitiousous,2011-07-11T21:49Z,"Oh god... this movie looks like it was made in 1969, not 1979. Can't watch sorry. Can't believe it was made the same year as Alien and is newer than Star Wars. It's definately a 60's movie by looks and acting. Duh. V 8/10 for a DVD rip."
,creffield,2011-07-14T04:00Z,"You guys are just TOO much. lol@ Sit closer to the screen. awesome! Yeah, I once sadly came across someone who paid (good money at the time) for the PAN and SCAN version of Jurassic Park. I told him that's missing up to HALF the film, and he could have paid the SAME price for the wide-screen version. WELL, he went on about not liking the ""black bars"" and I wrote him off as a fucking lame and never spoke to him again. NOW To the guy who said that THE BLACK HOLE looks like it was made in the 60's. LOL It would have been a real crappy film if it had been. Remember we're talking THE 70's here. compared to the films that are coming out NOW, they're all crappy looking.
Thanks for your time, fellow Black Hole fans."
,LittleAlienRobot,2012-05-28T10:00Z,"As i understand it: Black bars equal = theatrical version = 2:20  / tv: 21:9 
so for people wanting full screen or 16:9 full screen are going to miss out on some areas - thats why to get bigger pictures you need a bigger screen the more the better :)

just my thoughts - good luck"
