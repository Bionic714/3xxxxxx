This is a crack for Austin Meyers fenomenal (airplane) simulator. When mounted it takes away the 10-min limit play-cap that is applied in the downloadable version. The downloadable version is really a full version, but has just got terrain-data for a tiny bit of USA. The latest version on www.x-plane.com is 8.11, and updates often. 

If you want the terrain-data, I've got it, but it is like 4Gb, but then you have for example data for every road and most of the houses in the whole USA! There is data for the rest of the world too, but not as detailed. But there is small third-party patches out containing detailed airport and terrain-data to, for example, sweden.
If you want the terrain-data DVD, post you're interest in the coments and I'll seed it.

If you have'nt checked x-plane out, do it right away!
Happy flying!
