,The Omen,2006-03-07T13:37Z,"You sir, are an idiot. Protools needs proprietary hardware to run. It is no matter of ""simply"" writing a dongle emulator. Why don't you buy an el cheapo M-Audio card and run Protools LE  that way? Personally I couldn't be bothered since LE is utter shite anyway. Do it the TDM way or don't do it at all..."
,johan_musik,2006-03-10T18:19Z,No stupid motherfuck The omen. There is a dongle to protools so fuck you!!! you don`t know enything.
