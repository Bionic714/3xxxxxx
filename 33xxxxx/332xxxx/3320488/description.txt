'It is 1945 and the war has just ended in China. Jet gets meddled with some annoying American soldiers who cause trouble to the local people. Jet doesn't accept that kind of behavior and will teach these bastards a lesson.' 

Jet Li's directorial debut which is very different compared to his other movies. It's very brutal with ugly ringfighting scenes. Fight is always carried out until either drops. Jet Li gets his ass kicked big time, and you really begin to hate those navy clowns.
