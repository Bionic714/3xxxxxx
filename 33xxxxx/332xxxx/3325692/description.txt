I just noticed file .014 in CD5 is corrupt. I'll upload it here when i get the working one. DOH! But CD5 only contains extras etc. The Apps/Programs/Isos themselves are in CD1 - CD4. 

So no worries really, you're not missing any files from the folders that contain the Actual Programs! They all work as they should!
