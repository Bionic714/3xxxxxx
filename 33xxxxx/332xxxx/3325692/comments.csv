,Smith,2005-05-05T02:26Z,"If you're using Azureus and updated to v2.3.0.0 you also need to update your java virtual machine to the latest version.

Then your torrents will work again."

,HailZortY,2005-05-05T17:48Z,en dum fråga kanske.. men vad gör man med dessa program..? jag leter efter ett bra video redigerings program. om ngn vet nått bra kan du la vara schyst att skriva ett mejl
,skwerl,2005-05-05T18:30Z,"Someone posted about the Mac version, ""05.04.05.Adobe.Creative.Suite.2.Premium.MAC.OSX-RoME""...

But I can't find it here or anywhere else. I must be a clueless mac newbie. Is it actually available somewhere?"
,macio,2005-05-05T18:37Z,Ahha - Sommarnatt...I didn't realise that you could do that! Any advice on which BT's allow you to download seperate parts...a google search has proved fruitless. Thanks for ya help. :¬)
,n20,2005-05-05T18:53Z,anyone know how to make this a dvd

,harry123,2005-05-05T21:27Z,Time to implement ratio rules here with time delay for bad ratios. everyone who has 100% complete stop seeding. Very annoying!
,catonine,2005-05-05T21:29Z,"can someone pls seed?
Cheers"
,cansas,2005-05-05T21:49Z,why does this stop at 99.8%?
,cansas,2005-05-05T21:54Z,99.8% (2533.90 MiB)
,stardude,2005-05-05T22:07Z,"cansas: either formsoldier's client bugged out or his computer went down from going full force the last 24 hours to give us this fine release.

the ppl who got it first left as soon as they got it so now none of us can seed it to help delivering this release to the masses =~"
,stardude,2005-05-05T22:36Z,"w00t!! somarnatt to the rescue again!! =D

but, won't it be messed up if you have the complete version and this one is the one with file 14 on cd 5 corrupt??"

,harry123,2005-05-05T23:08Z,"Is the 1 mb missing from the cd5 .014 file by any change the remaining 0.2%?
Could someone who had reached 99,8% try the seperate file released earlier?"

,cansas,2005-05-05T23:38Z,im missing same files
,stardude,2005-05-05T23:42Z,"The problem is that we need someone with the exact files as the ones formsoldier have or else the torrent won't let it finish(security), meaning only someone who already downloaded the complete files can help out to get us the last 2 MB that will let the rest of us seed. =\"
,cansas,2005-05-05T23:46Z,"yeah, i have already sent 8gb while waiting to get 100%"
,formsoldier,2005-05-06T00:04Z,"hmm, i don't get it. i've been on seed all the time. i'll restart my client right away.

formtrooper"
,cansas,2005-05-06T00:59Z,CAN'T YOU JUST RESEED THIS STUFF?
,formsoldier,2005-05-06T01:05Z,"actually, theres no need. i just noticed its uploading. but only to few peers. maybe 1-3 at a time. so what i really need is another seeder. "
,BlastGT2000,2005-05-06T01:09Z,It isn't helping that the tracker is consistently timing out when trying to connect. Oh for that one seeder......
,cansas,2005-05-06T01:13Z,make a new post with proper release :-) then people with proper release could help seeding?
,formsoldier,2005-05-06T01:16Z,it is a proper release. 
,formsoldier,2005-05-06T01:17Z,clarify: the only thing wrong is that i can't upload to many peers at the same time. thus leaving a lot of people stranded at 98.9 % . 
,BlastGT2000,2005-05-06T02:01Z,"At least Azureus finally got a connection to the tracker again, so I can see you, form. Glad to see you're in the list, even if it takes a while for my turn on your connection."

,stardude,2005-05-06T05:36Z,"weee, for a while this torrent was on the top 5 here!! =D"
,colamannen,2005-05-06T08:32Z,"Its possible to extract CD:s 1,2,3 and 7 when youre stuck at 99,8%. Since CD 4 is important to make the programs work, I suggest that you make a new torrent of CD 4. Please!"
,TobbeT,2005-05-06T09:56Z,va ere här för program??=P
,harry123,2005-05-06T10:09Z,so there should be a seeder for about 8 hours now. Still I don't see anyone with 100%. Something is not right Formsoldier. Uploading 0.2% should be ready to a LOT of people now.
,harry123,2005-05-06T10:17Z,I'm switching to the other release. After 6gb upload I tired of waiting.
,ns54321,2005-05-06T10:38Z,Which other release?
,ChickenLoad,2005-05-06T13:01Z,"Wooohoooo!!!

I got it to work.

First I replaced the corrupt file on the cd 5, then extracted everything so I got the .bin files.

Tried to install the whole suite, it installed photoshop and then it didn't want to continue. So I installed all the programs manually.

So when I tried to register photoshop it didn't accept the response code, it had worked on all the other apps. That was because the photoshop got installed as the suite, therefor it wanted the suite response code.

So all you 99,8%, just replace the corrupt file. I got it from here at piratebay. Then you are in business."
,webslave,2005-05-06T13:18Z,"http://piratebay.org/torrents-details.php?id=3326319&hit=1 has the proper release.
It's made from another download, no connection with this corrupted torrent. It's working, extracted, and seeding."

,formsoldier,2005-05-06T15:44Z,whatever. i'm still on seed. this baby is in top 5 on tpb anyway. yiha. =)
,zodiaq,2005-05-06T15:58Z,Already got it so i'll help seed this mofo :)
,formsoldier,2005-05-06T16:10Z,"can some of you who're stuck at 99.8 % post your problems / the files that aren't complete.  because 0.2% out of 2458 MiB = 4,916 MiB . whatever it is, this torrent got ""sneknullat"" as we say in swedish. "
,formsoldier,2005-05-06T16:28Z,"but as another poster said. 99.8 % = 100% . it has to, because i have all the files. and it works for me. so all of you on 99.8 % . its done =). "
,HailZortY,2005-05-06T16:43Z,kan ngn förklara för mig vad detta e för program?!!

,stardude,2005-05-06T20:22Z,"ugh, I tried to extract cd 5 by replacing the corrupt rar but no go =

So, I extracted the first three cds + cd 7 since they were completed and then went on downloading webslave's extracted release and that finally landed me with the complete set, w00t! =D

Many thanks to formsoldier though, something went really wrong with this torrent and I can't figure out what but at least it helped spread some working files =)"
,formsoldier,2005-05-06T20:27Z,"thanks stardude . i was just thinking. i could replace the old .014 in CD5 with the new working one. And then Create a new torrent for all of the folder... SO YOU guys could leech that one. It would resume to whatever state you're at right now. Should I try this? I think I SHOULD :D. Cuz obviously this torrent is erronoeus or something, i've uploaded a few torrents on other sites without trouble. this was all just weird. So just give me a go and I'll create a new torrent! Like I said it should Resume for you peeps! "
,formsoldier,2005-05-06T21:06Z,"read CAREFULLY and thoroughly. read ALL of the description, don't want any newbie q's on my private message-inbox :) . when you're done reading and have taken all the actions necessary as outlined there in my description, THEN you can download the torrent itself and start leeching away .

,Bubbl3gum,2005-05-06T22:14Z,Var hittar man serialnummer? Snälla svara!
,formsoldier,2005-05-06T22:59Z,ska det vara svårt att läsa en liten .nfo fil? jag antar att du har fått ner torrenten annars hade du inte frågat om serial . så här får du direktlänk till .nfo filen på nforce. där står ju allt: http://www.nforce.nl/index.php?m=nfo&id=90271

,ulRich2,2005-05-07T11:49Z,"If you are blocked in 99,8 of the torrent, just download the file given at http://thepiratebay.org/torrents-details.php?id=3325870&hit=1 and replace the one you just have. Then unpack using the latest WinRAR, even if your torrent client shows incomplete other files. Everything should work perfectly. This worked perfect in my case."

,netpirate,2005-05-08T00:14Z,"formsoldier thats very fine if only it was possible to connect to the tracker...  i used almost an hour last night without any luck... so i choose this one even though it's a hell of a time before reaching 98.8 %

;)"
,formsoldier,2005-05-08T00:34Z,"hm, i've uploaded another torrent. i thought people had seen this. download that one instead. but read carefully through the description

http://thepiratebay.org/torrents-details.php?id=3326755

probably my 3rd time or something posting this now. everything works fine there.. just rtfm"
,netpirate,2005-05-08T13:10Z,"Ok I am getting confused here.

I downloaded this one until I reached 99.8%. Then I downloaded the replace file for CD 5 and replaced it. After that I downloaded the remaining 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrents-details.php?id=3326755

and reached 100%. So far so good. 


BUT

What I got was not at all .rar files but 7 CD's with tda's and 1 cue file in each CD containing 0 KB and 1 bin file in each CD containing 0 KB. How am I surposed to install this?  I dont work if I make it to an iso. and nothing else work.  IfI try to mount the cur files I am getting this error:

""Unable to mount image. Cue sheet: No tracks specified""

Furthermore where's the keygen?

Am I missing something here or what's going on?

I would like to think that after seeding 12 gbyte and waiting 36+ hours to finish this download that it would work.

Or maybe I am just not getting the picture?"
