Thank you for the subtitle link! Really appreciated!

Personal comment: You amy also want to watch the movie Nobody Knows [Japan 2004]  http://thepiratebay.org/torrents-details.php?id=3320213

...The suffering of the little Children in this movie. Is it possible to grieve after watching this movie? If you don't after watching it, you may be required to turn in proof that you still have a human heart.
