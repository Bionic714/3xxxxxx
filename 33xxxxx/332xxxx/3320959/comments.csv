,BlizBob,2008-02-05T10:53Z,"As Filthiest already said (in swedish. In future it might be better to use english eh? Filthiest?) this is how to burn it:
Use DVDdecrypter.
Install dvd-decrypter and go to the folder where the gi-files are stored.
Choose the smallest of the files and open it with dvd-decrypter and burn it to a dvd.

Important!!!

Use the slowest possible writing speed for all ps2 games! For me it's 4x. If you burn a game faster it might not work properly or not at all.
The same goes for all dvd-movies and other media used on PS2. Also the Verbatim dvds are considered to be the best for ps2.
That's all. Enjoy."
