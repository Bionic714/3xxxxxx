,Brandis,2005-04-25T15:04Z,Why .rar?!! :axe:
,Junksu,2005-04-25T16:23Z,Because it's better than zip?
,Brandis,2005-04-25T16:42Z,Why pack it at all? It's a movie. That means it's already compressed!
,Brandis,2005-04-25T16:43Z,I GUESS it's a movie... I'm not sure what it is 'cause he has compressed it!
,Teknokrat,2005-04-25T20:29Z,"Perhaps the *.rar contains more than one movie? That could be the reason he rared it - to make one file instead - not so useful here, but he could be sharing it on other p2p networks too (where one file would make more sense).

I haven't finished this download yet so I'm not sure if my theory is correct..."
,Brandis,2005-04-26T11:38Z,Exactly... it makes people think more than twice about what we are downloading since we are NOT SURE of what we're getting! That's the point I'm trying to make.
