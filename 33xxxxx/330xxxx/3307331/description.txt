“This was the project of Peter Bursch, a master of acoustic guitar. Besides the Broselmaschine albums, he has issued several hand books on how to play acoustic guitar. He formed the first Broselmaschine line-up way back in 1968, inspired by the American folk music of Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Phil Ochs and Joni Mitchell. Some of these people brought with them experiences from Irish and British folklore. During the early seventies the band lived as a commune in Duisburg. Their first album was recorded in August 1971 and released on Pilz. It included six tracks in all, most outstanding was their Steeleye Span-ish version of the Scottish traditional song "Lassie", which came with perfect multi-voice harmonies electric guitar and mandolin. Other tracks like "Schmetterling" had a more eastern flavour with sitar. It is one of the best German folk rock albums ever recorded! 
Regretfully Broselmaschine disbanded about a year after this release. Some of the members travelled to India. In 1975 Peter Bursch formed a new Broselmaschine, now dubbing themselves 'Peter Bursch & Die Broselmaschine' They were helped by Mani Neumeier and Roland Schaeffer from Guru Guru and Jan Fride from Kraan on a new LP project. In spite of these guest appearances, the resulting album was still in a clearly defined folk style, although quite different from the 1972 album.” – Cosmic Dreams At Play

One of my day dreaming in the sun albums, nice and relaxing during that afternoon sleepy mood, a subtle use of Eastern sounds, and even a wah-wah guitar says hello without freaking out.
BTW, Brosel was apparently a political writer (though I can’t seem to verify this anywhere but Freak Emporium’s description of a different album!) and it is also German for ‘crumb’. The ‘o’ should have an umlaut, of course.
Enjoy!
