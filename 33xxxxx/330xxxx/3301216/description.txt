Klassisk blues från Junior Wells!

All Music Guide: One of the truly classic blues albums of the 1960s, and one of the first to fully document the smoky ambience of a night at a West side nightspot in the superior acoustics of a recording studio. Wells just set up with his usual cohorts — guitarist Buddy Guy (billed as 'Friendly Chap' on first vinyl pressings), bassist Jack Myers, and drummer Billy Warren — and proceeded to blow up a storm, bringing an immediacy to 'Snatch It Back and Hold It,' 'You Don't Love Me,' 'Chitlin Con Carne,' and the rest that is absolutely mesmerizing. - Bill Dahl
