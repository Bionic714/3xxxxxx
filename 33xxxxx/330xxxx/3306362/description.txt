If you're a keyboardist, guitarist, songwriter or producer or even an 
aspiring music industry personality, 
you'll feel right at home with Delta SP running on your Desktop.

Keyboardists enjoy a plugin host that allows you to 
connect your Keyboard into the PC, 
and then play "as if" you had a rack of synths and modules 
only limited by the PC. 

This means literally hundreds of different synths and effects to
choose from with the click of a mouse while jamming. 

Your audience will think you have a pantechnicon full 
of gear in the back but you'll just be jamming away 
with your notebook and Delta SP. 

Don't know what you'll do with those roadies once you've tried it.
