A great music video made the the group Ghost, they sing a cover of Queens "Show Must Go On".
It's a tribute to the Saab 37 Viggen and F10 Airforce Base. 
All band members worked at F10

I get a tear in my eye when I watch this video, the Viggen should not have been retired. This video gives me memorys to swedens glory days.

All aircraft enthusiats must see this, and everone else who like the Viggen :)

Long Live 791:a Klarg√∂rings Plutonen!
