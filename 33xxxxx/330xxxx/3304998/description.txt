Being home sick can be very boring. But atleast it meant I found some time to share some of my stuff again.

This time I thought it would be cool to share some of my favourite 80's moments. 
Some classic ones you have heard many times and some really rare things I think you will like as much as I do. 

Also included some Italo Disco as it was a big part of the 80's aswell ;-)
Please help sharing as you finish it.

Enjoy!
