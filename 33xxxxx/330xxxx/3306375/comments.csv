,Deputy276,2008-05-26T16:18Z,"Be advised that the 2nd and 3rd movies are NOT widescreen/letterbox versions. That is not unusual, since availability of the second movie in widescreen is very limited. It exists, it's just hard to find. The third movie was a TV release, so it is only available in full screen. But it is the unedited version where you see the rat vs pecker battle during the closing credits. Good upload and all movies get a 10/10 for video/audio."
