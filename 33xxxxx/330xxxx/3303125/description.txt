A young girl is hospitalized. When an ultrasound examination reveals that there’s something moving inside her, a surgeon operates only to find himself faced with – not a baby, but the disembodied head of a beautiful girl. Her name is Tomie, and she is in the process of regenerating herself. Though you may try, Tomie cannot be killed. She will return to seduce and to kill. The surgeon disappears, infected by Tomie’s blood, leaving his daughter Yumi, to find out who Tomie is and what happened to her father.
