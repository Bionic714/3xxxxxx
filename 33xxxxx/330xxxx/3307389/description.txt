För er som inte har dual-layer dvd brännare..
rELeaSe iNFo.. 
  
Allstars already released a DVD5 of there DVD9. They ripped Spanish
language, ours include all languages and is a way more handy ;)
Our package includes 2 rars. One is for the PAL boxes and the otherone   
for the NTSC boxes. It will only delete the dashupdate.xbe, the credits
and the not needed movies of the other region. You only miss the credits.
Languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian
Just Copy the content of our .rar into the dir you host the .iso of
the Allstar-DVD9 of Splinter Cell: CT and run the .bat file to remake
the iso. It will take its time, so lean back and smoke while your PC
works. A small window will PopUp and show you the progress, after a while
it will ask you to delete a folder, just put Y in and press enter.
It will continue remaking the iso for you.

Iso done ? Start burning the shit now :)
Thanks Allstars for the nice Gift !
[make sure you have a bit of free drive space, it needs a temp dir
(which it removes afterwards) to do its work.
