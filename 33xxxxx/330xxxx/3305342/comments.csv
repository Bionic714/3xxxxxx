NOTES
We felt a movie as great as this
shouldn't be treated with a bitrate
such low as ...Blah, BLAH! No. If I
had stripped the menu and done it as
DTS-ONLY the bitrate would had gone
down to ~2960 if I counted right. It's
close to the allowed but still not the
allowed so someone would had propered
it, no doubt about it. Anyway you
shouldn't mind using two precious
10cent discs on this classic :)

Disc1 chapters: 1-19, disc2: 20-35."
