,tallytsl,2008-11-27T20:26Z,"To answer your long-ago question... After you've lived with someone like that for long enough, there's nothing they can do that will break through the layer of numbness you've had to develop to simply survive. And it often takes something that extreme (in one way or another) to make you realize how much time you've wasted trying to help someone that can't (or won't) be helped and that it's time to move on. I suspect your question was rhetorical. And I doubt that anyone will look at comments on a 3-year old torrent. You just kinda' hit a nerve."
