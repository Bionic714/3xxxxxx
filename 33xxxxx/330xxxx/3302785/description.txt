The Secret of Monkey Island for SEGA CD. ISO+MP3+CUE, NTSC (USA) version.
This port is more or less identical to the PC CD-ROM version, but maybe someone still own an old Mega Drive/Genesis with a Sega CD :)

I also included the latest version of KEGA (excellent emulator) and US bios files for SCD, everything you need to play the game on PC if you don't own the original hardware ;)
