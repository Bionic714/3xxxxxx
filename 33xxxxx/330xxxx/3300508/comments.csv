,Hookander,2006-07-04T09:35Z,"People have found problems including me to play a game on LAN network. It's making somekind of ""syncronation"" problem and game ends. Normal Generals works perfectly on LAN, but who wants to play that coz it is too easy and it missing some important updates what zero hour brought. So how many has really got this Zero hour working on LAN more than to 1-30minutes with only using pirate versions?!

I noticed that Generals both of them uses Safedisc 2.81 protection, but I was unable to find any safedisc hider which can hide 2.8 version."

,viralintruder,2008-02-21T23:56Z,s
,dddeeefff105,2008-03-25T19:44Z,"hey viralintruder!!!
you have to have generals in the
C:\Program Files\EA Games\Command and Conquer Generals\
folder!
or else it cant find it......."
,[SweJohan],2008-04-12T08:53Z,It's a FAKE !.
,theRealKarmine,2008-04-30T22:54Z,or edit the registry and correct the install dir....and no it doesnt have to be legal.  my problem is running ZH after installing....is starts up then immediately shuts down.  i guess ill try moving to c: to see if that works.  with a 9gb C drive its tough :(
,gcnd0001,2008-05-12T01:33Z,you have to have the original c&c generals game installed. this is an expansion pack
,neroawaits,2009-03-13T23:27Z,"This has to be the slowest f ing torrent ever!!!

Generals needed too ffs!!!!!"
,Jimmythehedgehog,2009-03-17T04:43Z,"dddeeefff105.
Your solution does not work.
Even though its installed 'C:\Program Files\EA GAMES\Command and Conquer Generals'

I got my C & C Generals from a friend and I can play it fine. But when I try to install the mounted images it tells me 
'C&C Generals was not found. Please install the full version of C&C Generals and Try again.'
I really wanted to play the game..."
,mrriceboi,2009-05-16T05:04Z,"probably gonna look like a noob but I wanna play it  
how do you install the game after the burning the .cue and .bin to a disk. "
,TheNightFox,2009-07-18T02:02Z,"This game didn't work for me with an illegal copy of Generals, so I went out and bought the game. It is installing now.
I did have an idea on why it wasn't working for some of you. Maybe you need to install the latest patch for Generals. Not sure. I couldn't install the patch, so as I said, I went out and bought it.
Good luck to you all, and thanks DEViANCE"
,The-Light,2011-11-03T12:42Z,"For people never worked with generals(ZH) here's a few points the game checks on and can crash on:

-Zero Hour comes in 2 variants: standalone and as part of ""CnC The First Decade"" in TFD version it needs a Generals installation, the troopcrawler model for instance is taken from your generals folder, don't ask me if this is the TFD version or how to fix your directory problem, for i have the game legal and only needed to mess with the other points when trying to get it working under linux, which i got working.

-Generals(ZH) has some data in the registry, there's at least a version number, cd-key and an install directory, it can error on a missing cd-key, and without version nr and install directory you can't patch it.

-Generals(ZH) needs a data filled folder in your ""My Documents"" folder, it holds the settings.ini file and several others, if that folder is empty, than the game will not run, you'll have to manually get it from somewhere. This error occurs regularly.

-Generals(ZH) sometimes have the tendency to not function on 64bit systems and sometimes act strange on certain Operating Systems, to fix this at least make sure it's fully patched, the main menu background on the other hand is more difficult to fix, generals Zero Hour latest version is 1.04 or 1.4 (EA's not really straight in their numbering...)"
