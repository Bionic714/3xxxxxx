Guitar lovers will flip over this reissue's new bonus tracks: a conversation in which Stevie Ray Vaughan extols the virtues of Jimi Hendrix's playing and then essays them all in a medley of "Little Wing/Third Stone From the Sun." There's also the brief slide-guitar instrumental "Slip Slidin' Slim." What's breathtaking about these and the 10 remastered cuts that were the original 1985 album are the remarkably live amplifier tones. It sounds as though Vaughan's plugged directly into your stereo--especially at the climax of "Little Wing," where his Stratocaster feeds back through a wall of spinning Leslie speakers in a fit of psychedelic bliss. Otherwise, this CD still seems like a creative holding pattern for Vaughan, despite the addition of keyboardist Reese Wynans to broaden his band's palette. Nonetheless, the prophetic "Change It," which foreshadowed Vaughan's recovery from addiction by a year, and his in-concert staples "Ain't Gone 'n' Give Up on Love" and "Life Without You" debut here.
