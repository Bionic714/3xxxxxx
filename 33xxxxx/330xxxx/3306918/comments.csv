,jlglex80,2006-01-29T20:35Z,please seed although its spanish shit!!
,lilwoodenboy,2006-04-03T20:52Z,"after probably ten months of this at 99.6% and 2nd half unplayable with vlc/winamp/avipreview/wmp/gspot .. last night the bits came in slowly raising to 99.7% and guess what ...   video is completely playable! 

there is listed a seeder in the latin-americas with 100% and occassionally a few bits come in from this 'person.. perhaps 99.8% is not far off..   


ANYWAY  the playable video archive is available at-this-very-moment"
,lilwoodenboy,2006-04-04T07:12Z,"so yes .. if those stuck at 99.6% who are approaching 99.7% stop the torrent and/or copies the file to another location AFTER (99.7%) before your client deletes PIECE 318 for failing the hash check ...yes! it is possible to watch the movie perfectly!    
*this is one of those somewhat rare times.."
