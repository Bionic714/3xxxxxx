“One and only album by this Yugoslavian band from 1973. Their only album was released privately whilst the band was based in Holland so effectively this is a Dutch only release hence the reason some people have assumed the band was Dutch. Furious extreme loud psych rock with an armada of blistering guitars.” - FE

This is really raw hard rock – not as professional sounding as I was hoping, but an excellent addition to any rarities collection, and contains some of the grungiest fuzz guitar I have heard. 
Enjoy! Brainticket.
