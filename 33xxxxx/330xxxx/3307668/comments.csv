About the Program:

StormPredator is the result of years of experience in the weather graphics business. The founder of the company, Anthony Watts, is a 25 year broadcast meteorology veteran and was responsible for the first ever PC based weather graphics display system for broadcast television in 1983. Since then, hundreds of TV stations have used TV weather display equipment he designed to show weather on the nightly news. Companies such as WSI and Accu-Weather速 have relied upon systems designed right here.

StormPredator is a result of that experience. 

The StormPredator program was designed to meet several goals:

Ease of use by the meteorologist as well as the layman without special training 
A cutting edge, customizable, and ""fun"" user Interface with colors and skins 
A radar presentation that feels like a real ""radar scope"" (hence the round design) 
A smaller footprint to allow running at 800x600 screen size and a ""Mini View"" display 
Significant Storm Alerting and Tracking Tools, including ETA calculation 
An easy to use distance measuring tool to determine how far away storms are 
Support for land based (statute miles) and marine based use (nautical miles) 
Forecasting, Watch/Warning, and National/Regional Radar Tools 
Coverage of the entire USA NEXRAD Radar network 
Program Stability for continuous operation and ""always on"" alerting applications 
Ability to print and save still and loops of storms of interest for training 
Database driven for flexibility for future changes in the National Weather Service to support new radars, features, and products- one database file defines all the program parameters 
Flexible group licensing to allow this program to be used inexpensively by educators, civil defense, storm spotters, and other civic related groups 
And through the use of Optional Add-on Features and Data:
