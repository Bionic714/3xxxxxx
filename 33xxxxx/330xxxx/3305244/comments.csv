,greenthing,2005-04-02T03:30Z,"Is this game finished, its got a lot of bugs in it, that make it impossible to finish it. The release date for the pc version is 5/17/2005, so is this a ripped alpha version. The 3/31/2005 release date is for the PS2 version."
,punkmus,2005-08-03T16:32Z,"är det någon som har den riktiga releasen, eftersom det här är fullt med buggar och sånt? isf lägg upp det här på tpb"
,thatsmine,2006-05-30T21:33Z,"i have played a downloaded version (not from this site) and at the end there's a game on the attic where u have to put toys back into closets and the game crashes everytime (or the vacuumcleaner stops working ???) so it's impossible to finish this game ! but you DO get to finish all rooms and place all objects in the right place but u won't get all the puzzle peaces or the last ingredient for the lasagna ! but u can watch the end movie anyways, because it's a MPG file found into garfield/date/fmv folder
good luck ya all , the game is verry addictive !"
,thatsmine,2006-05-30T21:35Z,"oh 1 more thing ....it seems the game is timed ! because at the end there appeared a timer onscreen telling me i had only 1,5 hours left.
If it's 0:00 then it's GAME OVER !"
