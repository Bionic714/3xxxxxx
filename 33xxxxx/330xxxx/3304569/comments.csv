,Damp,2005-03-21T16:08Z,mr pctorrent adversier whore. Do you know what rar is? Maybe you should release it in rar you dumb fuck?
,GreyHades,2005-03-21T16:12Z,"There is no need to take against the uploader, maybe you should learn to apreciate the effort he made, if you dislike something then keep it to yourself, or maybe you should upload something"
,Struggle,2005-03-21T16:13Z,"Shut up and be happy that he is seeding it! Stop accusing people, why dont u put it up in rar if you are so perfect? So shut up or leave"
,theoseranihm,2005-03-21T16:13Z,Why the fuck should it be in rar format??? I have never understood that...thankful 4 answers! :)
,Struggle,2005-03-21T16:15Z,"Some people claim that if in rar, there may be one file that is corrupted. So they only need to download small megs instead of downloading the whole thing again. Thats why. 
Though, i have never had a corrupted rar or bin, iso etc.."
,theoseranihm,2005-03-21T16:16Z,"Me neither :)
Thank u 4 the answer though :)
Keep it up!"

,Struggle,2005-03-21T16:38Z,"still, this may just be a person who ripped this for ""YOU"" so you dont have to wait for original release. If you dont like this and want to wait for the proper rls, then dont come here and say something like ""rar u dumb shit"" Then u youst wait. 
The upploader here at TPB, has the right to upload precisley what he wants to. In what format he wants to packed or not.
So just shut the hell up and enjoy. 
End of discussion"

,Heisenberg,2005-03-21T21:35Z,"Är det fler än jag som tycker att nivån här inne sjunkit drastiskt efter hand som allt fler användare skriver inlägg på engelska? Var och varannan mening innehåller ju påhopp och svordomar. Skärpning, här är vi civilicerade människor och håller inte på med sådant.

Gentlemen; watch your language and do not resort to threats. Let's keep things civiliced in here."
,Damp,2005-03-22T00:06Z,Det jag stör mig på är att han tankar typ en release is stil med: Project.Snowblind-RELOADED men så rarar han upp den och renamar all skit och lägger in massa reklam.

I don`t understand the problems from other the people.

I burned it two times with Blindwrite -trial v.5.2.10 with

verry slow speed (1x).

and all works fine !!!"
,frstbnd,2005-03-24T23:36Z,"I haven't tried burning it on BlindWrite in ""slow speed"" but I did burn it in ""fastest speed"" and guess what it didn't work =P

How to play via Daemon Tool 3.47: 
Just mount the Project SnowBlind image in Daemon Tool 3.47 then go to ""RUN"" in start menu then type Regedit (take note: my OS is Windows XP Professional SP2) then go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEM then highlight and RIGHT CLICK the FOLDER ""MountedDevices"" and click ""permissions..."" then Highlight ""Administrators"" and the menu below ""Permissions for Administrators"" check the box ""DENY"" in the ""READ"" section

I manage to make it work and played it =)  Thanks to killyouridol for the instruction and the one who posted the torrent and the seeders =)"
,frstbnd,2005-03-25T00:55Z,"Okey I tried burning the Image file into DVD-R and it didn't work T_T I burned it using BlindWrite 5.2.10 and at ""slow"" write speed T_T"
,the_vampire,2005-03-25T11:23Z,I tried again with daemon but this time I notice I had two administrators on my computer and this time I checked them both on deny to be sure and now it works and I'am happy :)

,Fahrenheit,2005-03-28T14:30Z,"Try burning it with Alcohol 120% (newest version!)... That worked for me - no problems burning/installing, but can't get the game stated!"
,crymoon,2005-03-29T12:55Z,"il faut penser a traduire le mot "" Administrators"" de l'exemple, dans la langue de votre installation ""Windowns"".(dans le 1er et 2sc racourci!)

ca marche!!(French!! post si besoin d aide ferait mon possible)

d'ont forget, traduction the "" Administrators"" word in your language installation ""windows"".(in the first and second shortcut(sorry for my english))

it s work fine


dload the program subinacl from here: http://club.cdfreaks.com/showthread.php?t=126518.
Click on Cheap Shortcut.
Then make 2 shortcut for Subinac.

In the Target add this for the first one.
""C:Program FilesWindows Resource KitsToolssubinacl.exe"" /keyreg ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINEHARDWAREDevicemapSCSISCSI Port 2"" /deny=administrateurs=r

Then the second one add this.
""C:Program FilesWindows Resource KitsToolssubinacl.exe"" /keyreg ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMMountedDevices"" /deny=administrateurs=r

Execute the first one then the second one, it should work.
PS make sure you have the right port mine is port 2.
