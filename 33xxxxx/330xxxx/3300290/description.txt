Great self-financed full-length debut album by US thrash band in the vein of Testament and Cyclone Temple. Kick-ass riffs, large amount of excellent solos and good vocals (not the contemporary mallcorish nu-metal crap growling) make this album 100% pure headbanging fun. My favourite 2004 Thrash Metal album.
