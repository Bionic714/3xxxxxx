OK its been a while since i posted a documentary so here is the Sex Pistols Blood On The Turntable. This is about how Johnny Rotten managed to successfully sue Malcolm Mclaren, it includes interviews with them both and is well worth a watch, enjoy!

Sex Pistols-Blood On The Turntable BBC3 UKTV 2004 SVCD 56m Minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.         http://www.videolan.org/
