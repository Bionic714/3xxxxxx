Notes 

Even though Spiral Trax has been around since 
1997, we have never had the chance to release a 
singles compilation. 

And so, we have finally decided to release a 
double CD featuring some of our favourites, 
unreleased remixes, forgotten or re-mastered 
tracks and it will even include some tunes that 
never made it onto CD. 

On this double pack you can find a smashing 
collection of some of Scandinavia's top 
progressive and psychedelic trance producers. 

If you like this release, please buy it, support 
the artist to be able to make more great tunes 
like these!
