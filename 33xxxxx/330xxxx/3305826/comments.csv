,Padraig,2006-07-28T22:23Z,could somebody seed this?
,wotthe7734,2007-07-31T20:23Z,"""Experimental"" is right, and truly challenging to the listener. Lots of 20th-century-modern ""serious"" music influence here - a marvelous band of tremendously talented, classically trained musicians pushing the rock envelope (including some terrific pitch-bending and quarter-tone stuff). Veers unexpectedly from an edge that will rattle your teeth to sublimely close harmony and back. Definitely takes some getting used to, but WOW! and well worth the long wait for the download.

I'd never heard of these guys before. Thanks, brainticket!

Just 2 brass farthings' worth from a pro classical choral singer lover of Brit folk-rock, art rock, and 20th-21st century ""classical""............"

Fast download too, cheers to the 4 of you that made it so fast (33mins) !"
