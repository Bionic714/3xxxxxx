The Nine Lives of Thomas Katz takes you on for a ride if you allow it to. But I've also encountered people who just couldn't relate to it. That gives it one further advantage. If you like the comic and the absurd, and you are rather open-minded, this movie is great to irritate your friends, who still think There's Something About Mary is the funniest movie ever made. 

This is a realy "laugh out Loud" Movie!
