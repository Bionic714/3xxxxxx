The heart of TOCA 2 is the complete 1998 British Touring Car season, with 
 all the new season's cars, drivers and new racing features. These include 
 all front-wheel drive cars and the introduction of pit stops, adding      
 strategy and planning to the frenetic action. Pit stops are taken in the  
 middle third of a BTCC race and the player's viewpoint switches to in-car 
 as tyres are changed and repairs are carried out against the clock."      
                                                                           
 On the special effects front, TOCA 2 replicates car damage better than    
 ever before: car wings are ripped off, bonnets are crumpled and fly off   
 at speed, and windscreens not only shatter and smash but feature rain     
 splash effects and bug splats.", "The roaring sound effects are designed  
 to leave players with a headache from the gritty, realistic noise of      
 engine roars and tyre screeches. Each tyre generates an individual noise  
 against the road surface, which combines to create a totally authentic    
 sound. A drum and bass soundtrack complements the effect perfectly."
