John Leguizamo's Sexaholix (a love story) [2002] - http://imdb.com/title/tt0318062/

(taken from imdb.com)
 In this one-man stage show, John Leguizamo acts out scenes from his past family life, touching on his 
relationships with his mother and father, grandparents, siblings, aunts and uncles, and his wife and children. 
He shares with us the lessons he's learned from his life experiences. I can't imagine there are too many people 
who couldn't relate to some of them. At times it's so intimate that it's hard to watch, but at other times it's
incredibly moving. And of course, it's funny. Mr. Leguizamo is so talented, it's a crime that he doesn't get 
better film roles. Hopefully, that will change soon.

John Leguizamo's Mambo Mouth [1991] - http://imdb.com/title/tt0247497/

(taken from imdb.com)
 MAMBO MOUTH is profane, scathing, blunt, and brutally honest. It is also one of the best stand up performances 
ever devised. I had the opportunity to see MAMBO MOUTH on television when I was a kid and it was the first time 
I was introduced to John Leguizambo. Very few people know about his history as a playwright before his various 
acting performances in film. MAMBO MOUTH is based on his won Obie award-winning play. Throughout the performance, 
he depicts various character stereotypes (including a woman) in his own unique, and very funny way. An excellent 
performance!
