,governator_ahnold,2006-02-05T20:57Z,"Not that it's all that great, but if you just burn it at 97.2% you only lose about 5 minutes off the end of Mambo mouth.  Sexaholix works as does everything else.  I PMed klownkillah, hopefully he'll reseed."

,slaughterXking,2007-08-23T17:26Z,Not sure how often the tracker is updated but uhhhh yeah....I too am stuck at 97.2% for a couple of days now.  Please seed and re-seed.
,txguy00,2007-08-30T14:35Z,Can someone please seed?  I'm stuck at a little over 97%.  I'll continue to seed the rest of the day.  Thanks!
,klownkillah,2007-09-08T20:31Z,"im sorry but i no longer have these files on my computer :(  this was uploaded 2.5 years ago

i would have to re-rip them from the original dvd's but that could potentially produce digitally different files that would be incompatible with this torrent unless i use the same software with the same options as i did 2.5 years ago.

the tracker says it was downloade4d 916 times, hopefully one of those people still have the files on their system and read this plea.

p.s. if i were to re-rip these i would probably lean more towards a DVDrip (avi) rather then a custom DVD due to the size difference.

,txguy00,2007-09-10T01:17Z,"Thanks for the update klownkillah.  For everyone who's still stuck waiting for seeds, I was able to buy a copy of all three shows and have uploaded them, in case klown's torrent dies or no one decides to reseed.  You can fnd them here:
