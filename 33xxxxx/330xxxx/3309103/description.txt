Introduction
============

ToxicOS is a third party flash upgrade for the DMS4 Pro modchip by Team Toxic.
While providing all the features of ToxicBIOS, it also provides a host of
innovative new features such as the ability to run games from the HDD.

So, whats new in this release?

- It is now possible to launch your PS2/PSX games and DVD movies off disc
  directly from within ToxicOS, bringing ToxicOS one step closer to being a
  full OS replacement for the standard PS2 browser.
- DVD-9 games such as Gran Turismo 4 are now playable from the HDD.
- 48-bit LBA support added, while keeping support for 28-bit applications
  on the same HDD (such as the Sony browser upgrade).
- Many compatibility fixes for playing games from the HDD have been included.
- Support has been added for DVD+R dual layer media, making DMS4 the worlds
  first modchip to support dual layer backups.
- Support for the V12 IDE HDD hack for those daring enough to attempt it :)
- Configuration screen added to ToxicOS where both modchip and OS settings
  can be manipulated. This has made the standard Toxic config menu obsolete.
- Games installed via ToxicOS now show an icon in the updated PS2 browser.
- Fixed Devolution mode with unlicensed memory cards (MM16 etc).
- Many other miscellaneous changes and fixes.

Unfortunately due to lack of time we had to leave out the integrated cheat
device as development has not been completed, however this will be included
with the next release of ToxicOS along with some other very cool features.

ToxicOS feature list
====================

OS features:

- Run PS2 games directly from a _IDE_ HDD. This leads to decreased loading
  times and makes gaming so much more convenient. Never again will you need
  to endure those painfully slow loading times!
- Boot standard discs (PS2, PSX, DVD) from inside ToxicOS (so you dont need
  to boot movies etc through the native PS2 browser).
- Run DVD-9 games from the HDD.
- 48-bit HDD support to enable the use of larger drives.
- V12 IDE HDD support.
- Configuration screen where various settings relating to both the BIOS and
  OS software can be configured.

BIOS features:

- Auto-detect and non-swap booting of all disc types (PS2, DVD, PSX, etc)
- Support for DVD+R dual layer media
- Compatible with all PS2 models V1-V12

- DVD region free, Macrovision removal and green screen fix for the DVD player
- Auto-ATAD patching for HDD-enabled games
- Fast boot mode for PS2, PSX and DVD movies
- Support for the HDD browser upgrade on a non-Sony HDD
- Set default boot mode to: Normal, MC/HDD Dev.olution, Fast Boot
- Playstation 2 game video fix (Colour Carrier, PAL, NTSC, PAL60), with
  automatic y-position correction
- Playstation 1 game video fix
- Enable MegaMemory memory cards without the need for the boot disc
- Configuration menu where various settings can be manipulated

- When booting from Dev.olution mode or Fast Boot, games use correct language
- Modchip disable mode, for online gaming
- Support for the Codebreaker cheat device
- 100% boot rate

Features planned for future releases include:

- Integrated cheat device, allowing you to use cheats while playing games
  from the HDD or CD/DVD without requiring a 3rd party cheating product.
- The ability to manipulate console settings such as screen size, date/time
  from inside of ToxicOS.
- Support for installing homebrew applications to the HDD or memory card. This
  will provide similar functionality to DMS Explorer/CC BootManager etc.
- Some suprises which we know you'll love!

Detailed Feature Overview
=========================

-> ToxicOS

   When booting into ToxicOS you will be presented with the main menu which
   lets you navigate through the various sections of ToxicOS.

   * Load Disk     - selecting this will load the disc currently inserted in 
                     the CDVD drive. This can be a PS2 game, PSX game or DVD 
		     movie.
   * HDD Games     - selecting this will bring you to the HDD game menu, as
                     described in more detail below.
   * Select Cheats - Currently not available, but in a future release will
                     take you to the cheat code menu.
   * Settings      - Takes you to the settings screen where the various
                     settings relating to both the OS and BIOS software
		     can be manipulated.

   You can boot into ToxicOS either by holding down R1 while the console
   is booting or setting the default boot mode to "ToxicOS".

-> Run games from the HDD!

   Using ToxicOS you can install and run games directly from an IDE HDD
   connected to your PS2. To do this, navigate to the 'HDD games" screen
   from the main menu. From here you can:

   a) Play games already installed on your HDD
   b) Install a new game to your HDD
   c) Remove a game from your HDD
   d) Rename a game on your HDD
   e) View information for a specific game and change game settings
   f) Return to the main menu

   At the main screen either the game list or toolbar is in focus at any one
   time. You can alternate focus with the LEFT and RIGHT buttons on the D-pad.
   When the game list is in focus the key mapping is as follows:

   UP/DOWN	- Select game
   CROSS	- Start playing the selected game
   TRIANGLE	- View info/settings for selected game
   L1		- Scroll page up
   R1		- Scroll page down

   When the toolbar is in focus, use the LEFT/RIGHT buttons to select an
   action and CROSS to choose that action. If you select install you will
   be taken to the installation screen. Here you will be asked to insert a 
   CD or DVD and then enter a name for the game using the onscreen keyboard.
   While at the onscreen keyboard the key mapping is as follows:

   D-pad	- Move selection
   CROSS	- Make selection
   START	- Shortcut for ENTER key
   CIRCLE	- Shortcut for CANCEL key
   L1		- Move cursor left
   R1		- Move cursor right
   L2		- Shortcut for BACKSPACE key
   R2		- Shortcut for SHIFT key

   Enter the name of the game then select ENTER to continue. Now the game
   will be installed to the HDD - and this can take a while, so be patient :)

   The rename and remove options in the toolbar are self-explanatory so no
   need to cover them here. The settings option will bring up the game info/
   settings dialog. From here you can see game information and change the
   compatibility mode settings. Some games require special compatibility modes
   to be set in order for those games to work correctly. More information
   regarding these compatibility modes will be made available shortly.

-> DVD+R dual layer media support

   Until now it has been impossible to play DVD9 games backed up onto dual
   layer media on the PS2 due to a problem with reading from the second layer
   because the data format on burnt DL discs is different than on pressed
   discs (burnt = OTP, pressed = PTP). However, we have discovered a software
   hack which enables the PS2 to read even burnt OTP discs meaning it is now
   possible to make backups of dual layer games such as GT4. ToxicOS includes
   an "auto-patching" mechanism which applies this patch on the fly. The
   auto-patcher is disabled by default, to enable set "DVD+R DL Support" in
   the settings menu.

   NOTE: Unfortunately due to software restrictions the auto-patching will
         not work if you boot your DL backup from the updated Sony browser
	 stored on the HDD. If you are using the updated browser then in
	 order to play your DL backups you must boot them either with
	 fastboot or from inside ToxicOS ("Launch Disc" from main menu). If
	 you are not using the browser update then there are no limitations
	 regarding how you can boot DL backups.

-> 48-bit HDD support

   ToxicOS has now broken the 28-bit barrier, making it possible to fully
   utilise HDD's with their capacity larger than 128GB. If you are using such
   a HDD you also have the option of using the Toxic Extened APA partition
   format on your HDD which has many advantages over the standard APA
   partition format, used by all other current PS2 HDD aplications (ie: homebrew
   software).

   MAKE SURE that you read the section relating to the two different partition
   formats below since it contains some VERY IMPORTANT information, especially
   relevant to those who wish to use homebrew software with "48-bit HDD support".

-> V12 IDE HDD support

   With the release of schematics by "automan" it has become possible to connect
   a standard IDE HDD to the V12 "pstwo" however all the current HDD
   applications have problems, forcing you to re-format the drive on each boot.
   ToxicOS has overcome this limitation and offers full V12 HDD support for
   those that are daring enough to wire up the IDE interface ;)

-> Dev.olution mode

   Using Dev.olution mode you can boot applications from either the memory
   card or hard disk drive. When booting in MC Dev.olution mode, the ELF file
   "mc0:/BOOT/BOOT.ELF" is launched. This ELF file can be anything you want, 
   such as DMS Explorer, PS2Menu, PS2OS etc. To boot in MC Dev.olution mode
   either hold down TRIANGLE on controller 1 while the PS2 is booting, or
   set default boot mode to MC Dev.olution in the configuration menu. Currently
   the only application which can be launched with HDD Dev.olution mode is
   DMS HDD Explorer. Once HDD Explorer is installed, you may boot in HDD
   Dev.olution mode by either holding down START on controller 1 while the PS2
   is booting, or set default boot mode to HDD Dev.olution in the configuration
   menu.

   NOTE: From ToxicOS v0.2 and up you must use DMS HDD Explorer v1.3 or
         greater. Older versions are no longer supported.

-> ATAD auto-patching

   When ATAD auto-patching is enabled, you can connect a non-Sony HDD to your
   PS2 and use it as though it was an official Sony drive. You will be able
   to install and use the HDD browser update (found on the HDD utility disc) on
   a non-Sony HDD, and you will be able to partially install some games with
   HDD support to improve performance.. even though this is a bit pointless
   with the existence of ToxicOS ;)

-> Fast boot mode

   Fast boot mode allows you to skip the redundant "swirling electrons" and
   various logo screens and directly load your PS2/PSX game or DVD movie as 
   soon as you turn on the console, saving valuable time which would be better 
   spent gaming. To use fast boot mode, either hold down SELECT while the PS2 
   is booting or set default boot mode to fast boot in the configuration menu.

-> Default boot mode

   Using the configuration menu you can set the default boot mode to one of the
   following: Normal, ToxicOS, Fast Boot, MC Dev.olution, HDD Dev.olution. If 
   you do not manually specify a boot mode while the PS2 is booting by holding 
   down a button on controller 1, the default boot mode will be used. For 
   example if the default boot mode is set to MC Dev.olution, when you turn on 
   the PS2 without holding down any buttons on the controller, your MC Dev.olution
   application will be loaded from the memory card. If you then wish to boot
   normally (i.e.: boot through standard browser) hold down CROSS on controller
   1 while booting to over-ride the default boot mode.

-> Playstation 2 game video fix

   There are 4 different modes for the PS2 video MODE fix, as described below:

   - Colour Carrier: The colour carrier of the video signal is changed to
     match the region of your console.
   - Force PAL: Video mode forced to PAL (50hz), regardless of what video mode
     games try to set.
   - Force NTSC: Video mode forced to NTSC (60hz), regardless of what video
     mode games try to set.
   - Force PAL60: Video mode forced to PAL60, which is 60hz with PAL colour
     carrier.

   In addition to the PS2 video MODE fix, you can also enable the PS2 video
   Y-POS fix. The y-position fix is used in conjunction with the PS2 video
   MODE fix in order to correct the vertical position of the display. For
   example, simply focing PAL when a NTSC game is running will generally result
   in the display being far off center. The y-position fix corrects this and
   centers the display. Please note that the y-position fix is not available
   when the PS2 video MODE fix is off or set to Color Carrier, since in these
   cases the video mode is not forced so the display position will not need
   to be corrected. Please note that the y-position fix feature should still
   be considered EXPERIMENTAL and has been known to cause problems with a few
   games. If a game isnt working, disable the y-position fix and see if this
   helps.

   You can configure the PS2 video MODE and PS2 video Y-POS fixes in the
   configuration menu.
   
-> Settings Menu

   The configuration menu is used to manipulate various ToxicOS settings, for
   example enabling or disabling ATAD auto-patching. The configuration menu also
   displays useful information about your PS2 system and DMS4 modchip. To enter
   the settings menu, boot into ToxicOS then at the main menu select "Settings".
   
-> Disable Mode

   When playing online games it is often necessary to disable the modchip so you
   do not get a DNAS error while connecting to the online game server. To
   disable DMS4, hold down L1 on controller 1 as the PS2 is booting. You will
   see a message saying that the modchip has been disabled. Insert your game and
   reset the console - the modchip will not be disabled and will stay disabled
   until the PS2 is placed in standby.

-> Codebreaker cheat device support

   The more recent codebreaker cheat devices include a protection system which
   is designed to detect the presence of modchips and prevent the application
   from working on a modified system. ToxicOS bypasses this protection and
   allows codebreaker to work properly, however you must first set
   "Auto Tray Eject" to OFF in the options menu.

HDD partition format information - ALL READ!
============================================

If you are using a 48-bit compatible HDD (ie: a HDD that has a capacity greater
than 128GB) ToxicOS gives you the option of either using the Toxic Extneded
APA format (abbreviated "APAEXT") or the standard APA partition format
(abbreviated "APA"). If your HDD is not formatted then you will be asked
if you wish to use APAEXT or APA. If your HDD is already formatted but you
have not used data past the 128GB boundary then you will be asked if you
wish to update to APAEXT (please note that you will not lose any data during
this process). APAEXT is better than APA in many ways and in general we
recommend that you use this, however there are some people who will want to
stick with the standard APA format as we will describe further down.

The reason why the two different formats are needed can get rather technical
and allough we recommend that you read all the information before making your
decision as to which format you use, we realise that the information is a lot
to take in and can be hard to understand so we will provide a simple set of
guidelines you can use to make your decision if you wish, and then following 
that some detailed information explaining the differences between the two
formats in more detail.

Simple Guidlines
----------------

 - If your HDD capacity is less than 128GB then APAEXT is not supported so the
   standard APA format will be used.
 - If your HDD capacity is greater than 128GB and you NEVER used or intend to
   use homebrew applications patched with 48-bit LBA support such as patched
   HDLoader, patched DMS Format Tools, 48-bit PS2OS etc then you should use
   APAEXT. This will allow you to completely fill the HDD with games for
   ToxicOS while maintaining compatibility with 28-bit HDD software (such as
   Sonys upgraded browser). THIS IS THE RECOMMENDED OPTION!
 - If your HDD capacity is greater than 128GB and you have used or intend to 
   use homebrew applications patched with 48-bit LBA support such as patched
   HDLoader, patched DMS Format Tools, 48-bit PS2OS etc (even though there is
   no point in using 48-bit versions of these applications if you intend to 
   use ToxicOS) then you should choose standard APA.

WARNING: Using 48-bit patched applications such as 48-bit HDLoader when the HDD
         has been formatted with APAEXT can cause HDD corruption! We recommend
	 that you simply avoid 48-bit patched HDD software and simply use the
	 standard 28-bit versions.

Technical information regarding the different formats
-----------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Here we assume that 1 gigabyte = 1024 megabytes, not 1000 megabytes. This
      makes the maximum capacity for a 28-bit HDD 128GB and not 137GB.

APAEXT essentially breaks the HDD into 2 parts, the first part being 128GB
large and the second part taking up the remaining space on the HDD. The first
part has the same format which current 28-bit HDD enabled homebrew software 
applications use. This makes it so that any such applications can utilise the
first 128GB of the HDD, and the applications will only see the first 128GB of
the HDD so they will not interfere with the game data stored on the second
part. The second part of the HDD *should* only be accessed by ToxicOS or
software which can recognise the format of the second part (at the time of
writing, ToxicOS is the only application which can do this).

The problem comes when you want other homebrew applications to be able to see
past the 128GB barrier. Some people have patched commonly used homebrew HDD
applications such as the DMS format tool etc to be able to utilise area past
the 128GB barrier, however these applications do not know about the APAEXT
format and if you use them on an APAEXT formatted HDD then if they write data
past the 128GB barrier YOUR HDD WILL BECOME CORRUPT! If you wish to use such
applications then you must tell ToxicOS to use the standard APA format - 
however if you have data written past the 128GB barrier using the standard APA
format you will not be able to use standard HDD enabled applications that
have not been patched to see past the 128GB barrier (such as the updated 
PS2 browser software)!

So, its all a bit of a mess really. If you format with APAEXT then you cannot
use homebrew applications with 48-bit HDD support. If you format with standard
APA you cannot use applications with only 28-bit HDD support once there is
data past the 128GB barrier. Keep in mind, that most applications only support
28-bit INCLUDING the updated PS2 browser which runs from the HDD. Therefore it
is our opinion that copies of homebrew software which have been patched to 
support 48-bit HDD's are generally bad news and you should try and avoid such 
software, ESPECIALLY IF YOUR HDD IS FORMATTED WITH APAEXT.

OUR RECOMMENDATION IS:

That you format with APAEXT and avoid homebrew applications with 48-bit support. 
There really is no need to use such applications anyway since ToxicOS will 
install games to the second part of the HDD first until it contains no more 
free space and only then will it start installing games to the first part. So, 
for most people you will have lots of space for homebrew applications to use 
on the first part of the HDD eliminating the need for homebrew applications
to see past the first 128GB.

Boot-time controller mapping
============================

When the console is booting, holding down certain buttons on controller 1 will
activate certain modes/features. These are listed below:

   CROSS    - Use standard boot (over-ride default boot mode setting)
   R1       - Boot into ToxicOS
   TRIANGLE - MC Dev.olution mode
   START    - HDD Dev.olution mode
   SELECT   - Fast boot mode
   L1       - Disable modchip

How to Install
==============

Installation directions vary depending on boot method:

- ELF boot: Simply execute the ELF using your favorite loader application 
  (PS2Menu, PS2Link, Naplink, PS2OS, LaunchELF etc) and follow the on-screen 
  directions.

- CD boot: Simply burn the BIN/CUE provided, boot the disc and follow the
  on-screen directions.

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Q: How do I boot into ToxicOS?
A: Hold R1 while booting the PS2 or set the default boot mode to "ToxicOS".

Q: Can I disable the "Toxic" logo displayed under the Playstation 2 logo when
   booting PS2 games?
A: Yes. Set "Display Toxic Logo" to NO in the configuration menu.

Q: Why do I get the "TV system doesn't match" error while trying to play a
   DVD movie?
A: You will be presented with this error if you attempt to play a PAL movie on
   a NTSC console. This is due to a limitation in the DVD player software and
   currently there is no way around this. We are looking into ways to fix this
   and hopefully a fix will be included in a future ToxicOS release.

Q: I have a feature request or bug report for Team Toxic. How can I contact you?
A: We do not provide any contact details such as e-mail addresses etc, however 
   we do monitor various "scene" forums so if you have a request or a problem
   then just make a post and there is a good chance we will see it and take note
   of it :)

Q: I have a game which isnt loading or working prorperly. What can I do?

   1) Disable y-position fix if it is enabled. This is still experimental and
      has been known to cause problems with a few games.
   2) Make sure that the game is burnt on good quality media at an appropriate
      speed. If your PS2's laser cannot read from your disc, the game will
      obviously not work.

Q: I have heard that some code was "stolen" in order to create ToxicOS, is this
   true?!
A: NO NO NO! People who say this are just trying to brainwash you in a sad
   attempt to hurt Team Toxic. The TRUTH is NOTHING was stolen, as I will explain.
   Its true that ToxicOS contains code from the open source projects ps2lib, 
   ps2drv and libhdd however this DOES NOT mean that we have stolen any code!

   them for anything they want be it commercial projects, freeware projects, 
   open source or closed source! The only requirement is that the copyrights

   the license file supplied with this release. Other than the projects 
   mentioned above, ALL OTHER CODE in ToxicOS was developed by Team Toxic - 
   its our code, it belongs to us, and we can do with it as we see fit.

Q: Will the source code for ToxicOS ever be released?
A: No. We dont feel it would be a good idea to release source code since then
   it would make it far too easy for certain groups to use our software for 
   their own financial gain by including it with their own products. Certain 
   HK companies will rip just about anything if they get a chance (even stuff 
   like Naplink.. "bootable Naplink CD's" anyone?) - so lets not give them 
   that opportunity :)

Version Information
===================

ToxicOS consists of ToxicBIOS at its core (which means it has all the same
features as ToxicBIOS) and the actual OS application. The version numbers 
for these components in this ToxicOS build are as follows:

BIOS v1.3
OS software v0.3

Change Log
==========

 0.3 Release:
 ------------

 * Updated core BIOS to ToxicBIOS v1.3, which includes the following changes:
   - Added support for DVD+R dual layer media, making DMS4 the worlds
     first modchip to support dual layer backups.
   - Fixed devolution mode with MM16 cards
   - Fixed booting PSX games which do not have SYSTEM.CNF
 * It is now possible to launch your PS2/PSX games and DVD movies off disc
   directly from within ToxicOS, bringing ToxicOS one step closer to being a
   full OS replacement for the standard PS2 browser.
 * DVD-9 games such as Gran Turismo 4 are now playable from the HDD.
 * 48-bit LBA support added, while keeping support for 28-bit applications
   on the same HDD (such as the Sony browser upgrade).
 * Many compatibility fixes for playing games from the HDD have been included.
 * Support for the V12 IDE HDD hack for those daring enough to attempt it :)
 * Configuration screen added to ToxicOS where both modchip and OS settings
   can be manipulated. This has made the standard Toxic config menu obsolete.

Group News
==========

Team Toxic is also working on a patcher for DVD9 games which will allow you
to patch the disc image so it can be burnt onto DVD+R DL media and used with
any modchip. The effect is similar to the auto-patcher already integrated
into our flash except the patch is applied before the disc is burnt and not
as it is loaded.

However, we had to question if this was a good idea when we learnt that
certain modchip manufacturers have been planning to rip our DVD+R DL patching
code since it was originally announced, long before the actual ToxicOS release.
We have decided to still release this for the good of the scene however - but
if you see DVD+R support appear in other modchips in the near future please
keep in mind where this came from originally :)

On another note, we would like to send out a big "thank you" to the people
involved in beta testing this ToxicOS release (you know who you are). You
guys rule! :)

Miscellaneous
=============

ToxicOS may be hosted by anybody, anywhere - PROVIDED that the archive
remains unaltered and that it is not used in ways its not supposed to be!

Oh, and props to the DMS team for making such a nice modchip - even though
the flash they ship with the chip sucks and cant do much of anything :P
