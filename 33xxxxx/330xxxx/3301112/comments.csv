,Panorama,2005-03-12T18:31Z,it looks very strange to me that your torrent is just 90Mb. My own release amounts to over 600MB containing an iso-file which is a 1:1 copy. Take a look: http://piratebay.org/account-details.php?id=750749

,Goofhead,2005-03-12T20:55Z,"Hi, i'm sorry i do not understand any of the Slovenian languages :(  i'd appreciate a translation..

another strange thing is, I first ran a search on this before trying to upload the torrent.. but I never came across your one.. thanks for linking it so that the users have a choice..

I have the NFSIISE CD and yes it counts to around that amount of space.. this one however is not a cd image. its patched and minus the videos.. figured out that its a standalone copy as I ran it over multiple o/s's... the file size attributes to the compression (just to compensate for my crappy upstream), it should get to 3 figures after unzipping.. 

this has more or less become a classic for modern day nfs racers.. still it might come handy to those with low-grade machines.. so let me know if it goes well for u guyz..

p.s: either the tracker or my client has gone nuts... i've uploaded twice as much as the file but still no secondary copies.. :S"
,Slibberi,2005-03-12T22:19Z,How do you get it to work on xp? Nothing happens if you double click the exe...
,Ork0,2005-03-13T18:54Z,"""Hi, i'm sorry i do not understand any of the Slovenian languages""

what? it's scandinavian"
,Goofhead,2005-03-14T16:00Z,"grave mistake.. I meant scandinavian.. sorry :)

btw, last time I checked it ran fine on xp.. make sure it's the correct exe. I would appreciate if anyone could comment on the working order of the copy."
,Slibberi,2005-03-14T16:19Z,"Well, of course i pressed the right exe... i also tried to download some crappy ""glide wrapper"" but those things never work."
,Zoidipuh,2005-03-15T16:53Z,"It works fine for me too and i have  win xp with sp2.
Is there anybody who can upload NFS 1?
Would be great"
,gabo03,2005-04-13T05:13Z,please reseed a little bit this torrent
,Etni,2005-05-19T02:46Z,"Slibberi: use folder names when unzipping the package.

The music of the game is not included in this torrent. What a disappointment. Could someone please seed a FULL version of this game?"
,dj_tesla,2005-07-18T20:21Z,"I'va also the problem that it doesn't work, even if i clicked the right .exe.... I own WinXP Pro SP2. Does anyone solved this problem?"
,thojoh370,2006-11-25T09:02Z,"Here's how you get it to work in XP:
 1. Right-click the EXE file.
 2. Select ""Properties"" (or something like that).
 3. Open the ""Compatibility"" tab.
 4. Enable compatibility mode.
 5. Select ""Microsoft Windows 95"" and click OK.
The game should now work."
,Danny1536,2008-04-29T11:59Z,Please seed!
,deskpro256,2008-12-05T21:59Z,please seed!
,try4satish,2008-12-12T19:02Z,"Hi Goofhead, Very much Thanks for your upload,

I am looking for this game from loooong time , at last i found it here (that to small in size)

Once again Thanks :)"
,joeithun,2009-01-21T01:06Z,"Is it with or without music? 

Full game?"
,wanda_5,2009-01-23T09:53Z,"joeithun, read the messages. Theres already comments that its without movies or music, thats why its so small."
,MikhailxD,2009-06-16T06:46Z,how am i suppose to work it on windows vista...? wad to do?
,AmunD_NoR,2010-02-14T22:30Z,"YAAAYY!!! ::DD
It doesnt work on my pc (w7 32-bit, 2gb ram, ati radeon hd 4670)
It works a little bit on mum and dads pc, with lots of crashes (vista 32-bit, 2 gb ram, geforce 8200)
And it works perfect on dads old laptop!! (XP 32-bit, 512 mb or 1 gb ram, some old stupid graphic card...)

IM SO HAPPY!! GREAT MEMORIES!! Now i only need to get back NFS III.

To get it work on Vista, follow these instructions by ngp.

""Thanks for the info Kurkosdr! Those links helped other people on mininova and demonoid who were having problems. Another solution that I found that helped someone on Mininova was this:

""StrelokSTK, I found a fix for you and others. To get NFS II SE working on Windows XP and Vista, download a file called w512mb.zip. Go to this page:

http://www.compatdb.org/support/topics/175472_need_for_speed_2_se_and_win_xp_nfs2_se.html

and look for the link ""w512mb.zip"" by the poster Jeffaried. Once you have downloaded the zip file, extract all the files and open the folder, look for the file called ""nfs2senxp.sdb"". Click it, and Windows should ask you to choose a program to run the file. Click ""Select the Program from a list"" and click OK. Then, when you see a window with a bunch of programs to pick, choose the Browse button. Then, navigate to your hard drive's WINDOWS directory. Inside the WINDOWS folder, look for a folder called ""system32"". Go in that folder, and look for a program called ""sdbinst.exe"" and double click it. The list should now change to have the .sdb file open with ""AppFix & AppHelper Installer"". Click OK, and you should get a message saying the settings were updated successfully. Finally, hold CTRL+SHIFT+ESC on your keyboard. Task Manager should pop up. Look for any running processes of ""nfs2sen.exe"". Once you are certain NFS II SE is not running on your computer, double click the game and it should run successfully.""

The solution posted by Kurkosdr and this one has seemed to help the majority of people having problems getting this game to run on today's computers. ""

It works for me... I can start the game on w7, but not racing... And on vista, i can race 1/3 of the tries ^^
On XP u dont have to do anything... Just download and run game"
,Poketamonsta,2010-05-02T13:21Z,"great speed! good download! reminds me of the old days!!

just to help, if you are using windows vista, then right click on the NFS2EN.EXE and click properties. Go to the compatibility tab and check the box that says run in compatibility mode..select windows xp service pack 3 (it worked for me)

thanx a lot Goofhead for the torrent!

i really like games like these on whoch you dont have to install the game but rather just double click in the exe file. i would really appreciate it if someone suggested some good shooting/racing games that dont need to be installed. thanks  in advance!

Poketamonsta - comments you can trust!"

1. Download http://slil.ru/27798066
2. Unzip it in the game folder.
3. Edit the batch file, and change the nfsw.exe to nfs2sen.exe
