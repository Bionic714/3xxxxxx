Time for a new retro collection, this time with Loom! Someone upped the CD-ROM version here a couple of weeks ago, and now I've collected some other stuff and bring it all to you.

To run the game, d/l and install ScummVM (www.scummvm.org), it will run veerry smooth (forgot to include it in the torrent).

The torrent contains:

Loom (Amiga) (1990)
Loom (PC CD-ROM Version) (1992)
Loom (PC 16 Color Version) (1990)

CD and boxcovers
Soundtrack including audio drama 

and a walkthrough for you losers out there ;P

Enjoy!
