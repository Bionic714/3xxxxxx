,Corelian,2005-03-15T16:29Z,Does anyone have (or be able to make) a CD-image of the PC-CDROM version of Loom? That would be totally awesome.
,AssMaster,2005-03-15T16:34Z,"well, I'm seeding the Loom cd-rom right now here on tpb. just search for it :)"
,Corelian,2005-03-15T19:50Z,"OK, I must be stupid or something, but I can't find it no matter how I search for it. Could you post a link to it. Thanks in advance."
,AssMaster,2005-03-15T23:46Z,"I must also be stupid (and you too), in this torrent I've got the PC CD-ROM version! :D"
,Corelian,2005-03-17T17:47Z,"How about reading my first comment again:
...a CD-image...

I don't see a CD-image in this torrent."
,onionero,2005-03-19T05:24Z,Why not make one yourself?
,onionero,2005-03-19T05:29Z,"Er, sorry for the useless comment.  I would suggest burning the files from the rar to disk and then making an image on the hard drive from that, or having a burn program output to disk. UltraISO also makes iso files."
,Corelian,2005-03-19T23:24Z,"I know that I could make an image of this, but it wouldn't be ""original"". What I mean is that the audio has been compressed to mp3-format (which is lossy), so the quality wouldn't match the original. The difference is probably small, but it's more of a question of principle.

That said, I would really appreciate if someone could upload a CD-image of an original CD version of Loom, because it's damn hard to come by."
,Zakule,2006-02-12T11:03Z,If it's not a disc image of the original disc than this torrent isn't worth dick.  MP3 rips of mixed mode games are extremely unreliable and really not worth anyone's time to upload or download.
,AssMaster,2006-02-14T01:17Z,"I don't force anyone to d/l this if they don't like it. Besides, I don't have the original, so I haven't ripped it. This game works perfectly if you use ScummVM, if you want the _original_, happy hunting on eBay.."
,JELLY-j,2006-04-18T22:47Z,"i cant get the sound starting,,,whatsda problem?"
,Thomson486,2007-03-19T18:56Z,"Yeah.. I have the same problem, how to get the sound going?"
,jshfxpttrsn,2008-12-20T16:55Z,There is another torrent with every single lucasarts adventure game in it... That one has the Loom CD image.
,alchera,2011-08-14T23:21Z,Awesome upload. many thanks for taking the time!
