YES Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe
Evening of Yes Music Plus 

REVIEW If the title to this double-disc live set seems a little, er, roundabout, it's not just you. This material
was drawn from the Anderson/Bruford/Wakeman/Howe tour in 1989, a group that was contractually barred from using the
"Yes" moniker -- thus the reference to Yes Music (the "plus" most likely refers to the ABWH material). Mixing classics
("Starship Trooper," "Close to the Edge") with their recent material ("Order of the Universe," "Brother of Mine") is
a mixed bag, and the solo sections are purportedly less than thrilling, so proceed with caution before picking this
one up. You have to wonder why they didn't release material from the Union tour instead, since by all accounts that
was a real hoot. Note that a promotional EP containg four tracks from this release was issued by Herald in the US,
called An Evening of Yes Music... Plus Promo.
