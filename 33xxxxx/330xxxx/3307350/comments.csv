This is a run of the mill virtual analogue synth. The graphical interface is clearly laid out, but it's not pretty. There's also nothing special about the sounds. Some of the presets maxed out my CPU in FL Studio 7, when they were only standard synth bass sounds.
As the NFO states, ""This VSTi sucks!""

Thanks for sharing, but this is really not something anyone needs, when so many better alternatives are available."
