,Tech-Noir,2006-06-20T23:57Z,"Squadone68: As far as I know these are just standard .avi files, which means you just need to use a player to play them, such as Windows Media Player, VLC, heck even Winamp might work. Easiest would probably be to use VLC player at http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ . Download, install, start VLC, open the .avi movie file and you are done. Easy as pie. :)"
,squadone68,2006-06-21T05:32Z,Thanks for the help Tech-Noir
,theSquiggly,2006-07-16T13:06Z,"Thanks, raankh! =) Love these!!
And (to all not familiar with it); remember to check out 'The Party' (1968-peter sellers... i'm sure it's in the bay somewhere... ;) )!!! The ending is poor, but the first hour or so is (IMHO) the funniest hour+ ever caught on film! (makes me laugh just thinking of some of the scenes...)"

,Mangachaos,2010-06-25T23:02Z,"Did you know that BOTH seeders and clients is required when downloading something? Of course, sometimes it´s also about how many there are downloading as well. I´m not asking for seeds like the rest, but keep the speed up when downloading, helps out alot plus having no auto shutdown. A better connection might help. It´s not that expensive you know.

Sluta skriva att du behöver seeds. Det hjälper inte ändå. Det ska vara en balans och den dyker så småningom upp. Man måste ha tålamod när det gäller sånt här. 

- Stop writing about seeds. It doesn´t help anyways. There should be a balance and it will show up eventually. You have to have patience when it comes to these things.

Well, the Pink panther series is in it´s own class... it´s unbelieveable to think most the times Clouseau actually nails most cases.... (he must be very lucky concidering the hrm... accidents along the way.) I´ll help out a little with the seeding, but don´t expect mouach. 

(I wonder how he´s say ""Pink panther"" ... ""Pienk panthar""? Hm... maybe...)"
,Mangachaos,2010-06-25T23:05Z,"As for how long to seed... keep it around half what the movie´s size is... that should do it right? I mean if everyone does that (and have a great connection when downloading since if you haven´t, you can´t do that) then it goes like a ROCKET!"
,dr.claw,2010-12-20T15:40Z,"Please seed guys, this speed is just not on at all.

25kbps? Come onnn..."
,andreisun,2011-02-09T18:59Z,"Hey, nice torrent :) Does it have the ""Inspector Clouseau"" movie? Thanks"
