,proekaan,2005-04-02T20:45Z,"I know what you mean,I have uploaded couple of games and no one thanked me or rated the game,I found that annoying,so I commented it and not eventually people at least thanked me or then they asked for my help,because they couldn't get it to work.

Sometimes people are ungrateful,makes you feel if it was even worth it.But don't let that get to you,we need people like you who wants to share.:)"

Thanks for being here and giving me/us the ability to test new exciting russian games."

OK for all peeps having problems, and I think after my mess there will be quite a few, USE ISOBUSTER to unpack the files.
After that youn just put ALL files into one folder, run the *.msi (if the setup.exe wont work) to install to any directory, and the overwrite the original game exe with the supplied cracked one.

You really should think twice releasing this like that, when it was pretty easy, knowing how, to create working iso. :("
,proekaan,2005-04-10T08:42Z,"What mess? This release is working great on my computer,you don't need isobuster to unpack the files,you need winrar to extract the .bin and .cue files and then mount them on daemon tools or alcohol 120%,or burn them if you want.

This game is a solid shooter and I love it,thanks again pattyk.:)"
[T],TheSkaffer,2005-04-10T18:43Z,".
Well, my .cue's werent recognized as OK. With *any* of the programs you mention, except winrar of course. Even after generating new ones.

And lay off that high horse, just because it worked as intended for You, does not mean others may not have problems and have to find solutions to them...agreed?

I had probs, I found a solution, it worked, I posted about it. I am playing the game.
Now tell me what is wrong with that?"
,proekaan,2005-04-10T20:19Z,"Dude,chill,I don't understand why you are getting upset about.I just told you what I thought and you are getting angry about that.
If the .cue files didn't work on your computer,then some of your settings might(I said might,remember that) be wrong or something else,don't know what.
I have had the same problem with other games,meaning that the .cue file hasn't worked,but always the solution has been mounting the .bin file itself,now I don't know if this works every time,but it does for me.:)

Now I did ran into to one problem,the setup wouldn't start,so I did as the readme instructed and it worked.
I have no problem you posting solution to a problem someone else might have,THAT IS WHY I ASKED WHAT MESS,get it?

So please,before insulting,specify the problem,agreed?:)"
[T],TheSkaffer,2005-04-11T07:57Z,".
OK, maybe I should have described my initial problem better.
And maybe I was a bit rough. Sorry.

But I found a solution, and since the CueGen was included, the problem might have been expected.
I only hope someone else have use of the info I provided.

I do not consider my words *offensive*, though.

Cya around...;)"

I burn games I'm going to keep, so leaving it as it was released is best for mosy, but the .cue file is mountable with daemontools or alcohol 120 % and I put in the Note to users everything I did and the work around and to the best of my knowledge I'd done all I could to make it complete so I'm sorry people didn't know .cues are mountable.

,pattyk,2005-08-15T09:28Z,"mickyfive,

sorry to hear that. What's the error?
if you let me know I can look it up. no one else said anything like this.

A few questions:
 what software burner did you use?
 how fast did you burn it?
 have you had this type problem with other  software/games?

My reason for asking all this is, I'd been burning games/software starting from the time I got my computer, but for ssome reason I started getting burn errors.  After a long search I found my software (I always use the latest) relayed information to cd-r drive and often lost data.

I slowed down the speed from +8x to 4x and no more trouble

I'll get on it ASAP

Sorry you had troubles "
