,ze0ro,2005-03-27T07:12Z,Is this the official broadcast or the leak?
,evildick22,2005-03-27T10:44Z,Thanksss
,tompagenet,2005-03-27T11:04Z,"This may be great, but the file has only a tiny bit available - there are no seeders!"
,DaMixxMaster,2005-03-29T09:57Z,"does this have the sound fixed, like the one on UKNova? Is the sound louder on the replaced part if it is? and is the voiceover on the ending credits?"
,DaMixxMaster,2005-03-30T09:27Z,"FYI, the sound is the original with the sound bleed from BBC3. It also has the voice-over during the end credits..."
,tobio25,2005-03-30T22:35Z,"i think one star is a little stingy for this release, yes there is the sound bleed thing, but thats the BBC's fault, not mine.  I cant vote for my own stuff."
,jawa_pro,2005-04-01T13:04Z,Is there any difference between the this and the leaked version?
,DaMixxMaster,2005-04-02T02:08Z,"I gave you a 4 star vote. Great picture quality, just missing a bit of both the credits, and of course the Norton Invasion. Still, GREAT job!
 There IS a perfect DVD version on the newsgroups, that has the audio fixed, full credits and is DVD compliant. It also supposedly has some extras, as well...I'm hoping this gets on a BitTorrent site soon!"
,jawa_pro,2005-04-02T14:55Z,"Can someone please let me know if the leaked version was the final version, or should I download the aired one?"
,DaMixxMaster,2005-04-02T22:09Z,"the leaked wasn't final. It had different theme music, as well as other minor stuff."
,chocice,2005-04-02T22:18Z,"Many many thanks...I just don't understand why people complain when you have gone to so much trouble to post an excellent copy... Certainly not your fault the BBC cocked up and it doesn't spoil anyone's enjoyment. If it does, wait until it's out on DVD !!! Hope you will be posting the next one."
,jawa_pro,2005-04-03T07:43Z,"Thanks a lot. I'll make sure I get this version too.

I wasnt sure if it would be a waste of time or not. If the leak had been final then I wouldnt have bothered.

Thanks for being helpful, and thanks to the seeder too."
,ChuckB,2005-05-09T01:51Z,why are the episodes so damn big? are they two hours long each or something?
