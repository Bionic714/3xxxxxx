,tsippadippa,2005-03-25T10:26Z,"Even though I don't like Drama/romantic movies in general, this is a _GREAT_ movie. I just hope someone would upload the ""sequel"" to this, Before Sunset ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381681/ ) where the two main characters meet again after 9 years.. (which is the time between these two movies)
