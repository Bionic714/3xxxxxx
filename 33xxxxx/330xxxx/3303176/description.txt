OK here's Schwartzeneggar supporting Jawbreaker in Glasgow, its a short set of 32 minutes but great anyway. Steve Ignorant keeps leaning out towards the crowd so his face is a bit dark sometimes otherwise its up to my usual quality. This is a great show and i hope you enjoy it!

Schwartzeneggar-Nice And Sleazy Glasgow 22nd October 1994 SVCD 32m Minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.         http://www.videolan.org/
