Sole album from this French trio originally released in 1969. Featuring Claude Engel (who went on to form Magma), this is prototype French heavy progressive rock with acoustic interludes. There's some mean acid guitar work with flute garnish and side two is devoted to one long live track based on a Rimbaud poem. Only 1000 albums were pressed on initial release making this a rare and welcome issue.
