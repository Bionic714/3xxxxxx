Lone Wolf and Cub (Kozure Okami) TV show Season One Episodes 1-6

This Japanese TV series (1973-1976) has 78 episodes, starring Nakamora Kinnosuke as Okami Ito.
How does this compare to the movies? It's a great TV series, the characters are well developed and improve, even the child has more space compared to the films.  I was sceptical at first because I love the movies, but hey, this series is top notch too!!!  

This is the first episode pack, I will seed this until at least one full download. 

!!!!Please help seeding this after you fully downloaded.!!!!

  Then I will seed the next  episodes. Enjoy. Your thanks and comments are welcome

Thanks for Unt and Bonsaisan for seeding this at first  ;-)
