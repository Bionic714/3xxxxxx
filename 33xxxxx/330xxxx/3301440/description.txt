Alright here is another one i filmed, this time its No Fun At All on there first UK tour. This is the same gig as the Millencolin show and has the same small crazy crowd, stage diving when theres only a few people there to catch them. No Fun At All are excellent and its filmed in my usual high standard, enjoy!

No Fun At All-D.O.Y. Leeds England 11th December 1995 SVCD 50m Minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.         http://www.videolan.org/
