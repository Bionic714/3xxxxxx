EyeToy: AntiGrav implements the EyeToy technology in a new way through hoverboard gameplay. You'll move your body, not a controller, to guide your character through steering, speed, and trick maneuvers as you interact with the environment and avoid obstacles. Pick the best racing line to discover hidden areas and unlockable sections along the fast-paced courses. Compete against other AI-controlled hoverboard racers, or challenge a friend as you race alongside the "ghost" image of your friend's best performance.
