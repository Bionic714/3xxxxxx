,LezDawson,2008-08-23T12:04Z,"Highly recommended - much more powerful and punchy than the remix, and sounds good turned up loud (unlike the remix).
BTW, KingStar doesn't understand the difference between a remix and a remaster.  His so-called Genesis 'remaster' torrents are actually 2007 digital reMIXes, created on Pro Tools by Nick Davis, and thus sound digital, over-processed, harsh on the ear, and over-compressed.
This one is actually a true 'remaster' - it was remastered around 1994 from the original 1975 analogue mix, and sounds great. :)"
