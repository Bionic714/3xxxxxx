Deleted the other since I got so many complaints about not working with different clients. This torrent is made with Make Torrent 2 and will hopefully work
with all clients. I deleted the samples so that took away about 200-300mb.

To u guys that was still downloading it, u should be able to just resume. If youre client has that option :)
