,boothrp,2005-03-20T20:33Z,"Hi, Great album. Thanks for the upload. I had no problem with the Decca Small Faces album after I renamed them to .FLAC.
Not very difficult to figure out, and certainly NOT crap files/music.  Keep up the good work. Please don't be discouraged by people who feel the need to insult your effort when they have little imagination !! I'm Grateful, and I'm sure others are too.  Thanks. "
