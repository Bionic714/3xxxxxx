“Based in Rome, L'Uovo di Colombo was another of those bands that just made an album without their record company support, so the band disappeared soon after the album release.
L'Uovo di Colombo is a great album, with the very good voice of Toni Gionta (his real surname was Tartarini and he was later the singer with Cherry Five) backed by a keyboard/bass/drums trio in perfect Le Orme style with occasional use of acoustic and electric guitar. The solid rhythm section and competent keyboard playing give the album a very high quality and the eight tracks are all perfectly enjoyable.
Two album tracks were also released as a single, the opening track, L'indecisione and the instrumental guitar-driven Turba, but with no success. Among the other album tracks, a mention for Consiglio, with keyboards in evidence and a very good vocal part.”-IP

Note of interest – Elio Volpini was later (1975) in Etna.
You think the cover was an influence for the future poster for the film Alien? haha:)

Enjoy!
