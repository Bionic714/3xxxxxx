   FIFA Street is a highly-anticipated combination of arcade action blended 
   with the culture of freestyle street soccer. By removing the rules from
   the simulation soccer experience, FIFA Street exposes the heart of the
   world's beautiful game, on-the-ball flare and individual style. 
   Leading this movement are the worlds top professional players, showing 
   off their skills and individual style in 4-on-4 match-ups against the
   backdrop of global venues that represent the true culture of street
   soccer. As the first game to support dynamic 1-on-1 encounters,
   beating your opponent will require skill, 
   technique, and the careful selection of specific moves. As a gamer
   you'll take on the best and be required to earn their respect,
   gradually building your reputation and team into an unstoppable force
   that leads the tide of street soccer.

   Game is: Eng,Fra,Ger
