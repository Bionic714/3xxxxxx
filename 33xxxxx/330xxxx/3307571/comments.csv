,leroSorel,2009-06-21T08:53Z,"I seem to be having trouble with loading the Novation Bass Station into ableton live.

I always get an error message saying ableton has to close.

Anyone else getting a similar problem?

it seems to be happening with everything made by Novation so I'm wondering if it's just a simple compatibility issue."
,ben_burble,2009-08-04T15:30Z,"@lero Solel:
When Using VISTA i suggest to start ableton 'as administrator' because some vst plugins write changes into the registry. I had the Ableton close-problem when changing the single outputs of the 'Drumazon'-plugin"
