,byroan,2005-07-07T04:36Z,About 12 hours left on the other torrent. LOL I wonder how many people are just sitting at 99.8%. Soon everyone will be able to help seed. I don't want to be the only one.

,blubbda,2009-02-17T19:24Z,"this torrent sucks donkey balls. i rechecked my season 6 files and fucksocks ...
1. one part is missing... (i,done #2)
2. many others files in season 6 are FUBAR, some more, some less (i.e. some will crash my wmp,vlc, and zoomplayer)
3. some files did not even work in mplayer or virtualdub without unrecoverable errors

KILL IT WITH FIRE ...

seriously.. though its slower now  get the other princeofbelair torrent here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3843306/The_Fresh_Prince_of_Bel-Air_-_Complete_TV_Show_-%5Bq8pride77%5D-... 

you'll save yourself lots of hassle trying to complete the files you got with this one AND the other torrent probably has better quality (175mb files compared to 100 mb files in this nonworking torrent)"
,aajai,2009-03-20T10:56Z,"yes blubbda, the other torrent got better quality (at least for season 1) compared to this one..
haven't started dl the other seasons yet.."

,wissamitter,2010-11-16T14:39Z,"I'm sick and tired of looking for good quality of this TV Show, So I purchased the DVDs for season 1-5 and I'll rip them myself into great quality of size 350MB per episode. I should receive the DVDs in about 7 days from today (Nov 17, 2010) and will start ripping from season 1 - 5 eventually, but it will take sometime, so please be patient. I will post them here on pirate bay every season in a separate torrent starting from season 1. My upload speed is only 100Kbps, but still better than nothing i guess. Because my upload speed is low, you guys have to promise to keep seeding my torrents when i post them. 

Let me know what you think by emailing me at wissamgumtree@hotmail.com. You can post suggestions and thanks there also. If you would like to make a donation to help me recover the cost i paid for the DVDs feel free to let me know on that email, if not that's fine, i just do it to help everyone.

Piratebay trackers won't allow people to connect easily to seeders (or at least that's what i noticed after uploading another torrent before). What can i do to make seeding better? If you can help with advise feel free to let me know as well."
,wissamitter,2010-11-19T02:09Z,"High quality are coming!!!

,KezizuWAT,2011-12-19T05:10Z,"The quality isn't that great, but it's watchable and you have to remember this was early 90s.
Two problems though:
Season 5: The first 2 episodes names are mixed up, should be vice versa.

Season 6: You're missing the last episode of the last season, wtf"
,KezizuWAT,2011-12-19T05:33Z,"Ok, nevermind about the problem in Season 6, almost every episode is screwed up one way or another.

For Season 6, go here:
