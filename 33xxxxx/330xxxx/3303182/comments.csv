,elyk1212,2009-04-19T02:12Z,"The songs are sped up.  They sound like chipmunks.  See the other torrent, it has less bit rate, but that's probably because it is more accurate (yes yes, here is almost twice the data here, but it is way to fast).    

So, you'd think these are better quality, but no... just faster ;)

Anyhow, listen to the actual CD and you'll see what I mean.
