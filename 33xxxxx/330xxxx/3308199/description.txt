Studio Clean is a DirectX compatible plug-in suite for use in host applications
such as audio editing or processing software. It consists of four plug-ins for
noise reduction and quality enhancements:

- StudioDenoiser is a plug-in for broadband noise reduction. Because the
  algorithm takes the perceptual properties of the human hearing into account it
  achieves a high level of noise reduction with a minimum of artifacts. 
- StudioDeclicker contains two different algorithms. The actual click filter
  eliminates larger clicks and pops in the recording, while the crackle filter
  eliminates very frequent, but short clicks. 
- StudioDeclipper restores recordings that suffer from analog or digital
  clipping. 
- StudioRebirth adds synthesized high frequency harmonics to give life to old
  and dull sounding recordings.
