,Derc,2006-09-04T00:20Z,"Tried and tested here... I want you all to know who are downloading from the bay... I am going to seed this till 500% then, I will combine these three cd's and start a new torrent I think it was really lame the uploader didnt do this (BTW) but.... otherwise all is well and its a solid download ...I gave you 5 stars. Only reason Im doing this is for those who are on old pc's OR have bought one as a second PC like me,,,, and want some cool games like this to play on it. ;)

,LimeJet,2007-10-16T20:08Z,"Download ""Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds the Clone Campaigns by Lime"" instead. I actually works."
,Red_Band_of_the_Hand,2008-06-09T22:58Z,"A little install tutorial.

First I used poweriso (though alcohol 120 and daemon also work) for the files. Then I installed both cd 1 and cd 2 (which can be found here). The first time I was able to play with the second cd mounted, but that didn't work.Luckily gamecopyworld.com had a crack. Just replace the battlegrounds.exe with gcw's version 1.1 exe.

,Red_Band_of_the_Hand,2008-06-09T22:58Z,"Oh, this was on vista 64 bit."
,Tivol,2008-06-13T20:54Z,"No-one download this!
It doesn't work, first of all it doesn't even contain the setup file; and if you paste the setup file from the cd, there are still loads of files missing.
So I'm telling you don't download this!"
