This course is chronological, beginning with the appearance of hominids in Africa, their evolution to Homo sapiens and the spread of Homo sapiens around the globe, to the rise of man’s first civilizations.

This comprehensive course discusses the answers that the latest scientific and archaeological research and theorizing provide to questions including:

How do we know humankind began in Africa? 
How and when did people begin to migrate elsewhere? 
What is so magical about prehistoric cave paintings? 

Lectures cover human origins, emergence of modern humans in Africa, spread of modern humans in the late Ice Age, peopling of the Americas, origins of agriculture and animal domestication, and beginnings of civilization in the Old and New Worlds.
