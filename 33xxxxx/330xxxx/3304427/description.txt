 Plot/Synopsis 

A startling, powerful film. If Alfred Hitchcock partnered with Walt Disney,
they'd make a picture like this		Roger Corman

Mima was a pop idol, worshipped by the masses until fashion dictated
otherwise. In order to salvage her career, she is advised to drop music 
and pursue acting. A soap opera role is offered but Mima's character is 
less clean cut than desired. Regardless, she agrees and events take a 
turn for the worse.

She begins to feel reality slip, that her life is not her own. She discovers 
(imagines) her identical twin, a mirror image that hasnâ€™t given up singing. 
Internet sites appear describing every intimate detail of her life and a 
figure stalks her from the shadows.

Her friends and associates are threatened (and killed) as Mima descends 
into a dangerous world of paranoid delusion. She fears for her life and 
must unravel fact from illusion in order to stay alive.

Perfect Blue represents a major change from traditional anime subject 
matter, analysing the pop icon phenomenon, fame and its psychological 
impact on the performer.

  Ripper Notes 

One of my absolute favorite Manga movies, wonderful animation and a great
plot, didn't find it out there so I thought I should put it out. To get
intact video and menus, I exchanged the videostream in some of the extras
with a picturestream, looks kinda crappy, but since I like the 
extras, especially the audio, I thought it better than to dump them 
completely. Also ripped english audiotrack. This is my first dvd-r release, 
enjoy!
