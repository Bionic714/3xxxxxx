,phonkyd3jv,2005-03-31T20:11Z,"this movie is great, underrated in my opinion, but I guess it's mostly just a bit rare and unknown.

some people compare it to donnie darko, and it got some resemblance, but overall jacob's ladder is different, more horror.

anyway, don't miss this movie, and don't forget to watch the deleted scenes... they should've been in the movie, no doubt... freaky shit.

It even somehow managed to crash my bsplayer.
Anbody else with that problem or is my file whacked?"
