,kidcommander,2008-04-02T21:12Z," I'm currently seeding. Thing is, it's pretty low quality. especially considering it's 3 times bigger than it needs to be. Anyone know of another torrent?"

,donavon_bray,2009-06-24T06:28Z,"Excuse me, Mr. Dead Torrent? I was just wondering, what with your batshit crazy language in the description and all, do you happen to be in English? It sure would be great if I could watch this movie without having to know what the fuck an ""antihjalte"" is."
,GameQude,2010-03-15T18:34Z,"I'll translate the text as good as I can:

""TV-rip from a sci-fi channel of an self-produced tv-movie. The quality isn't that great (in different terms) but a must for everyone who wants to see our antihero bruce campbell kick some alien butt.

It can happen that I'll have to stop seeding, but have no fear because I wont stop seeding until I see that more has it so please help seeding."
