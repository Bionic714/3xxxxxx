,|isak|,2006-07-30T20:54Z,are there any seeders for the whole file?
,Homebrew52,2006-10-31T14:50Z,"Before you waste a week downloading the entire torrent, try downloading one file of it.  As far as I have been able to discern, there is no audio on any of the files.  The other two of dadinho's 24 torrents (Season 2 and Season 3) look to be okay, but I'm going elsewhere for Season 1."
,zeback,2007-03-10T21:22Z,Seed Please.
