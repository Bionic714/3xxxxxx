,themurlock,2005-03-18T10:15Z,"Thanks for the effort, but sorry man, your description fails to mention that Costes 5 & 6 are ripped in one piece without gaps, quality starts as low as 128 and several songs are cut off at the end ..."
,Kiba,2005-03-18T10:59Z,"I downloaded these from SuprNova in those days, and then added vol. 7. I must admitt that i was just guessing about the bitrate... Most songs are crossfaded, to make a smoother change of songs; so blame that on Stéphane."
