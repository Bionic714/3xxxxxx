,TwinTower,2006-10-14T20:29Z,WARNING!! Norton detected Keymaker.exe as a hacktool!
,thedude808,2007-03-14T13:29Z,^ No shit? It is a tool for hacking a program  >.> dumbass.
,Uncle_Ian,2007-04-10T23:53Z,"I submitted the keymaker.exe file to http://www.virustotal.com which allows you to upload files 10MB in size or less, where it was scanned by 31(!) different antivirus programs.  Symantec does indeed identify it as a ""hacktool"" because, well, it is!  29 other AVs ""found nothing.""  One, an AV I'm not familiar with called Fortinet, vaguely identifies it as a ""possible threat,"" possibly because it's a hacktool, which is why we want it in the first place, I suppose. 

This file was uploaded to BitTorrent two years ago.  Based on my scan using April 10, 2007 virus definitions with 31 scanners, I'm going to step out on a ledge and say that it's probably safe to use.  "

,SmileyWitchFaerie,2009-04-14T08:45Z,"Norton does that to everything I install with a keygen, I just scan it with malwarebytes and turn off Norton while I use the useful keygen:)  viola it works!  This way Norton doesn't eat it before I get to use it :)"
