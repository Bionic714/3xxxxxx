Ancient Egyptian civilization is so monumental that it is sometimes difficult to grasp: it lasted 3,000 years, longer than any other on the planet. 

This course spans all of ancient Egyptian history, dividing it into three periods called Kingdoms:
(1) In the Old Kingdom, Egypt was united under one supreme ruler, the pharaoh. During this period, the pyramids were built and the rules of Egyptian art were established that would govern for 3,000 years. 

(2) In the Middle Kingdom, the nation fought to regain its greatness after the Old Kingdom collapsed. 

(3) The glamorous New Kingdom was when all the stars—Hatshepsut, Tutankhamen, Ramses the Great, Cleopatra, and others—appeared.

The lectures cover religious practices, magic, mummies, pyramid-building, and more.
