,The_Evil_138,2011-02-08T00:22Z,"Thanks for sharing this with all of us. Great movie, a bit cheesy and the acting is a tad over done (in a good way). All in all though it's kind of a classic in my mind. I mean come on it's Def Leppard, if it was done with accademy award winning actors it would not of worked. Thanks again, and thanks to all you seeders out there for keeping it going."
