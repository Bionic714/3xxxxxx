,gnurkel,2005-04-01T20:49Z,"Yes you may ask - Don Rosa is the best. The level of detail, the dynamic drawings and all the action that goes in the background. Its just hilarious and very, very well written"

,LucisFerens,2007-01-03T19:33Z,"Don Rosa better than Carl Barks?
No Way!
Carl Barks is number one!"
,LucisFerens,2007-01-03T19:34Z,"to open those damn cbr and cbz files, rename them to .rar and extract (you can use the OpenOffice word processor to make nice PDFs out of them)"
,eivindms,2007-06-01T01:13Z,"Carl Barks is way better than Don Rosa. Much more creative and funny stories. Everything Don Rosa made was based on Barks. 

But he is a very good second (Don Rosa)."
,haakon.t,2007-08-12T13:42Z,Don Rosa is way better than Carl Barks! Don Rosa must be the world's funniest man jugded by his cartoons. Carl Barks is just a good drawer.
,jarod925,2007-11-17T00:29Z,Hi! What image viewer can we use to open the files?
,SvenViking,2007-12-16T16:02Z,"Just for clarification, this is nowhere near ""every"" Donald Duck comic produced by Carl Barks (he drew over 500 stories, this torrent contains 151 pages). Still an excellent torrent, of course.

I prefer Barks' stories to Don Rosa's, but guess it's all a matter of opinion. Just keep in mind that Rosa is generally working with concepts and characters Barks created (Scrooge, the Beagle Boys, Gladstone, Gyro Gearloose, Glomgold, Magica de Spell, the Junior Woodchucks, etc.). Even characters originally created by Walt Disney (e.g. Donald Duck) were thoroughly altered by Barks, and Don Rosa obviously uses these altered versions, not the originals as seen in old Disney animation clips. If Don Rosa has managed to improve on these concepts, that's great, but he'd be the first to acknowledge his debt to Barks."
,SvenViking,2007-12-16T16:20Z,"""151 pages"" -- oops, wrote the wrong thing there. Still far from every DD story by Barks, though.

jarod925: Though fancier programs are probably available, CDisplay is a simple app that'd open the files for you. Can't seem to post the URL here -- try a Google search."
