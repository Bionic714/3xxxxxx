,codgecodge,2008-08-18T02:56Z,"Thankyou for this iPEX. I DLed this OK but have come back looking for serial which I will try the one mentioned here, thankyou for that HP Ninja.
I have 100% and have left it in my DL folder for others yet it shows no seeders for this yet I am one and will stay one,it is a small file after all.
When I go to install this Install sheild warns about shared serials on the net being used so I will disconnect from the net while I install with this serial given here."
