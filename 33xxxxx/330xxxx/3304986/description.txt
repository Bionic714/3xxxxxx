Once again www.back2bizkit.net brings you a awsome bootleg from Limp Bizkit. This time you can enjoy a good ol' show from back in 1999, when they released their second album Significant Other. The show doesn't have super'b quality, but it's still a awsome show, and features a interesting tracklist. One of the few times they played 'A Lesson Learned' was at this show.

Go to the B2B-forum, where you can vote for the next torrent from us, that will be "released" a week from now... ENJOY MY DEAR BIZ-KIDS!!
