No, cuz of 2 things:

1:IC dont require a CD to play, only installation.
2:Even if you would need CD/crack to play, what you download here is the CUE and BIN file, in other words the CD"

,ZEROS_OST,2006-07-18T00:33Z,"Hoi, newbie installer here:

I have the original Disc 1, but I lost Disc 2, so I've downloaded that alone. 

But I still can't install past the 38% mark, because it always asks ""INSERT DISC TWO"" to complete installation, and then I'm stuck big time. Daemon's Tools aren't working either (I tried to set it as F Drive but no go). 

Any ideas ppl ? =D"

,bigbodomfan,2007-10-28T00:20Z,"ok I downloaded torrent (seeding it right now by the way u n00bs)...fuckin' used Daemon tools to mount CD1 and installed, then switched my mount to CD2 when it came time and kept installing, then switched back to CD1 image when asked. It installed perfectly. Then I installed the Insect Add-On that came with this and opened the unlocker...worked 100%! Finally, I copy and pasted the short-cuts for the game from the Add-ons torrent file to the new IC file made from installation so I could play.I've been now playing the game and loving it. Works fantastic. Than=x!"
