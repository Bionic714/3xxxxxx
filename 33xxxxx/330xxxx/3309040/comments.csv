Är det någon som vet värdet på en felfri vinylskiva 'Other Voices'? Jag köpte den för 50:- för 12 år sedan i en skivbod."

,gorgenxx,2005-04-02T14:51Z,"Yes! This implicates that the release of LA Woman was in April, a couple of months before Jim Morrison died in July 1971.
An odd thing was that  Morrisons death was announced after he was buried in Paris and Pamela Morrison was one of few people that saw his corpse. She died of an heroine overdose in 1974."

There's seven leechers and no seeder, it's to say, no one has the whole archive. Seven peers waiting to complete their downloads. Is'n'it a pity that we can't hear all those great great songs again?"
,mabritta,2012-02-02T20:45Z,"Hey guys you'll find The Doors Other Voices in other torrent: The Doors - STUDIO DISCOGRAPHY. It's included on it. So, no more trouble with it."
