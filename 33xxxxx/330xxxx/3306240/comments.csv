,Ntsu,2005-04-01T19:57Z,Am I right to say that about 40 leechers need the last 0.02 Gb of this file?
,Esquilax,2005-04-08T04:00Z,"Does the updater need any kind of registration code?  I remember getting an updater for Final Cut Pro, and it wasn't usable because of that."
,Pedroscham,2005-04-22T12:33Z,"Can anyone seed just the 1.01 update, please?"
,nooneknowme,2005-06-07T11:47Z,"I need Apple Motion 2, please help me :-("

,mac_davis,2007-05-08T14:04Z,"No content DVD, and I don't think this one works for me. Perhaps I used an old serial."
,sonicalchemy,2007-06-05T16:52Z,I downloaded this motion but it did not run properly but it did install i guess it must be my macbook pro but i appreciate the share. thanx 
,TheIntrepidSpaceboySpiff,2007-06-30T11:29Z,"I am trying to download this for weeks now, I want tight integration with FCP 4.5, so Motion 2 is of no use to me. Can please some seed this a little more? It would be much appreciated..."
,TheIntrepidSpaceboySpiff,2007-07-02T08:13Z,"I am dedicating 50KB/s upload for this torrent alone, but I am stuck at 1.3GB :( Please folks seed!"
,TheIntrepidSpaceboySpiff,2007-07-04T08:04Z,"Seriously, am I doing something wrong here? I have unlimited up- and download on this and the connection is VERY fast 500 KB/s - but I only got a progress of 100MB in two days!
No, I don't have other dl running."

,sotamurphy,2008-07-07T00:27Z,Does anyone have the Noise Industries FxFactory Pro 2.0.3 Keygen available? These plugins are great for Motion and Final Cut 6.
,pktmotion,2008-11-12T04:42Z,"Hello,

Did I miss something? I didn't get a serial with my download. Will somebody please help me out? Maybe I'm not looking some where but I definitely don't see it."
,asdewqasdfgh69,2008-12-05T15:04Z,"this worked for me, the program would keep quitting after it was open for a few seconds but then i installed the update and now it works great. this does not include the content though. im working on finding that. if you need the serial just search a little, its not that hard to find. this is version 1.0 btw"
,stopimalreadydead,2008-12-26T22:23Z,C'mon guyz. Please seed. 4 kb/s on broadband?!?!
,stopimalreadydead,2008-12-30T04:40Z,"Damn this took some searching. I know this is kind of a noob move but I want everyone to be able to get the serial cuz this f'ing torrent took FOREVER to download!
