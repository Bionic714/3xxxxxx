,knoxius,2007-12-04T11:17Z,"For ones, who are downloading this:

I am one of permanent seeders and I see so many of you downloading game, but i don't really see that anyone would seed it after he/she has downloaded it. Why are you crying ""plz seed"" when you aren't doing it yourself? If I and other seeders quit, what would you do then? Please take it under your consideration.

I'm close to ratio 100.0 for this torrent, this is where it ends for me probably."
