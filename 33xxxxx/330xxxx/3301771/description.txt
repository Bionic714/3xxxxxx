Alright here's one for all the fans of 80's skate punk, the Stupids were a great UK band who some of you may be familiar with. The play really fast Skate Punk and anyone into that kind of stuff should check this out, or if you just like your Punk fast check it out, enjoy! 

The Stupids-Drive In Hit Movie Video Pro Shot 1987 SVCD 43m Minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.         http://www.videolan.org/
