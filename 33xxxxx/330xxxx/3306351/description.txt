Audio Caller ID keeps you in control of all your incoming phone calls.

It will announce a caller's name over your computer speakers, 
email you when specified calls are received, 
and even block calls you choose.

Audio Caller ID uses the latest text to speech engines,
so you will always be able to hear who is calling.  

You can optionally assign pre-recorded sounds to be 
played for specified callers.

Audio Caller ID can publish your call log to your own web site,
so you can see who has called, even when you're away from home.
