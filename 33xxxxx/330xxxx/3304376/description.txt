BitComet is prolly the best bittorrent client around but has recently been
banned from many private bittorrent trackers for sharing peers over them.
Is it justified ? prolly yes. We hope BitComet author will try to combine
both efficiency and security in future BitComet versions. 

But in the meanwhile we want to go on using our beloved BitComet. So here
are some peerID spoofing patches that make BitComet announce itself as
other famous bittorrent clients : Azureus v2.2.0.2, BitTornado v0.3.7 or
official BitTorrent v4.0.0 -> No more ban for BitComet!
