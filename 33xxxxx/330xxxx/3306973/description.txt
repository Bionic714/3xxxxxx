Les Miserables DVD - 10th Anniversary Concert at the Royal Albert Hall

Les Miserables - The Dream Cast in Concert (1998) DVD, converted to mp4 by Nero Recorde 2.

This is a 'staged' dvd to facilitate recording, those expecting a dvd of the actual musical, this is not for you.
It does show you the faces behind the songs though and is worth watching if you liked the double cd I posted.

This is  the full DVD.
