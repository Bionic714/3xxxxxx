,BlizBob,2008-03-17T21:22Z,"Note: Burn PS2 games as slow as possible. (1x 2x or 4x)
Also if the iso comes with a small file like devilmaycry.(something) size is something like 200kb or smaller. It's the instruction to the burner how to burn the game.
Also some burn programs have an option like ""playstation 2 disc"" ect. use it.
One more thing. Some don't know this but  you need either a mod chip or swap magic.

What I'd like to know is does this game have progressive scan?"
,BlizBob,2008-03-17T21:23Z,Oh! One more thing. If you put this on a HDD you should check a site called absolute anime and check HD loader combatibility list.
,GarryBSI,2010-02-07T07:09Z,"This works. (No-one else seemed to want to say anything.)

Have played first two levels so far.

Looks great. Will even buy it if I 'Get into it'. :)

Creating ISO with files and patched the ISO for Free McBoot+ESR set up on PS2 memory card. Burnt to DVD-R (4x)

If I finish the game I'll post a follow up."
,EvilArchithect,2010-07-28T17:50Z,Pal or NTSC?
,super_toaster,2010-09-06T17:08Z,Could we please get some more seeders? 5kbps is just too slow.
