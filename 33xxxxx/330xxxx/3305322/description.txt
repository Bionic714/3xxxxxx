        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yeah, the title says it all... 
        "The great reunion" of two unique artists in each one's instrument 
        mastery.
        You all know ( or should..) Grapelli, the greatest Jazz violin artist 
        ever...and Baden Powell, with his
        special bossa know-how and style playing guitar as only a Brazilian can 
        do. Here we a have a well 
        chosen selection of pieces than can make you experience 54 minutes of 
        heavenly (jazzy-bossa) musical 
        happiness......no more, no less.</font></p>

        La Grande Reunion Review</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#666666" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>This CD 
        by Stephane Grappelli combines a complete 1974 studio session with bossa 
        nova guitarist Baden Powell
        along with excerpts from a 1977 session with a large orchestra conducted 
        and arranged by Christian Chevalier.
        As long as a good melody is present, the veteran violinist can be counted 
        upon to swing it, as on the 
        collection of eight bossa nova songs, including the often-recorded "Desafinado" 
        and "Samba de Uma Notta" 
        (also know as "One Note Samba"). Powell is a talented guitarist 
        but not exactly at the level of the artists 
        who Grappelli recorded with during his long career (for example, Django 
        Reinhardt, Joe Pass, and Martin Taylor,
        to name a few). But the music is at least enjoyable even if it isn't overly 
        memorable. Unfortunately, the 
        orchestral session is closer to easy listening than jazz, with Chevalier's 
        sleepy arrangements proving to be 
        more of a distraction than a helpful background for Grappelli's solos, 
        especially on the overblown "You Are 
        the Sunshine of My Life," a piece that has been successfully adapted 
        by jazz musicians on many other occasions. 
        Even when the jazz group, anchored by keyboardist Maurice Vander, is added, 
        it is of little help. Overall, 
        this now out of print CD will likely be sought only by those who must 
        own Grappelli's complete discographical 
        output; anyone else can safely bypass this uneven release. ~ Ken Dryden,
