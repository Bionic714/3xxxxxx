ENGLISH PLEASE!!!! How stupid can you get and write in a total un understandable language. And if you cant write english then dont write at all, put up a link to the stuff you upload..
Since pirate bays rules says ""Do not write in other languages than english"".
I know that i whont download stuff i dont know what is..
So i guess i have to download this game from someone else and give him the credits.."

Everybody has the freedom to express their opinions, and in any language, so do I. There could be problem if people write in their own language, you're right, but please in this case the language written is one of the most talked languages in the world, Spanish. Don't get lame and lazy, think forward, you're just a link away to one of many good and free translators on the web. Translation of the text above is:
Alive world of pelicula: to fight against robots evil within the world of Robots and to interact with known personages, and to discover surroundings and totally new personages created specially for the game. - Update of personages: additional characteristics, amused parts of robot, mecanicos objects...

Do you understand a little bit more now? Here's the link to Babelfish translator:
http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com

Unfortunately there's no swedish translator, language-racist ;-)

Why can't you give him credits? You know English and as he managed to seed a torrent on this site he would know some English at least."
,batallon40,2005-03-27T17:50Z,Is this release only spanish? Or is it multilanguage? Thanks
[T],pctorrent,2005-03-28T02:57Z,"Its only spanish, sorry ;)"
,rotpurrOC,2009-01-20T04:35Z,"Hi, Thanks for the upload, but it would be nice if you could seed this please, I really need to get this game."
,brazilian.with.no.proud,2011-07-04T00:02Z,"SEED PLEASE!!!
