,NL74,2005-05-12T09:23Z,"Argh....getting the following error from latest BitTorrent client:

""HergĂŠ Tintin - The Complete Collection [23 Books][Darkseid Collection][English]"" : This .torrent file has been created with a broken tool and has incorrectly encoded filenames. Some or all of the filenames may appear different from what the creator of the .torrent file intended.""

and the client is unable to download anything...MOST FREAKIN FRUSTRATING. Could the creator mayhaps remove the ĂŠ characters and whatever other characters the BitTorrent client can't handle? 

Thanks in advance, I've been looking for these for a while : )
