,sSword,2005-03-20T04:03Z,"well done ganjaB!!

I have tested all of these on SPV C500 smartphone and they work great!!!
Some games need mutipress function on your fone, the C500 doesnt have multipress so some games are pretty unplayable

Someone pls post Flux Challenge and Pool3D for smartphone!!"
