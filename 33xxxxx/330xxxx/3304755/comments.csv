,Rockarfett,2005-03-21T23:39Z,En jäkligt skön rulle.
,caroboy,2005-03-22T15:35Z,"Nice info layout. I particularly appreciate the english sub. It helps greatly to enjoy more of the film.

Thanks a lot."
,speakeasy,2005-03-23T00:58Z,I've been looking for this - thanks
,ABUG,2005-03-23T15:06Z,"Apologies if duplicated.

Is this in English or is it with English subtitles"
,Panorama,2005-03-23T15:57Z,"yes of course it is English audio, it' a British film you know"
,kobbah,2005-03-25T21:51Z,kan nog redan nu säga att detta är årets bästa film
,nela04,2005-03-26T16:29Z,"hur är bilden på denna, bra eller??

how is the quality on this one, good or what??"
,Panorama,2005-03-26T21:13Z,"I think this is a plain dvd-rip, maybe a little bit shrinked to fit onto a dvd-5 disc. "
,PatrikW,2005-03-27T12:44Z,"Kanon rulle!!
Letar efter Soundtracken till denna! Igentligen bara en låt  den som spelas på Discot!! Någon som vet !!
Tack för en kanon film!
mvh Patrik"
,CpX,2005-05-13T13:58Z,"Hey, the song you are lookin for from the disco - Can't be found in the mixes state in the disco - It is AWESOME!

But you can listen to the original version (Which is pretty gay contra this mix).

Candi Staton and The Source- You've got the love (remix)

This is the version you can find, and also on the OST - 

WHICH IS SO STUPID AND LAME! since the disko version is so much cooler.... hope it helps!

else Drive To The Boatyard, Starsailor - Four to the Floor, Lisa Gerrard - Aria, FC Kahuna - Hayling, Opening, and last but not least - Ruthless Gravity! are all nice tracks if you are into movie stuff.... all from LAyer Cake OST!

,CpX,2005-05-14T18:01Z,"Sorry, the nice version of The SOURCE is on.

Just me who got a bid one... sry!

But the track is so much more cooler in the movie, with her dancing and everything is about her for those 3 mins or so :)"
,rotzooi1111,2005-05-26T20:02Z,Please seed!!!
,MaxNormal,2005-06-11T15:13Z,"With an ear to the ground it is possible to pick up info regarding a Guy Ritchie interest in this film. This would be misleading. It may be a 'Brit Gangster' film, however it is of a much darker nature and arguably much higher calibre than anything Guy Ritchie has churned out. 

The soundtrack is a winner, the characters are perfectly placed and to top it all ; 

This might knock 'Matrix Reloaded' off the top of my ""Best fight scenes of all time"" list. Not because of any incredible special effects, but just for the sheer barbarism of it ! 

A healthy smattering of humour, but make no mistake, this is a very real depiction of the criminal world. 

IMHO Rating : 92%"
,crocketkiller,2006-02-14T17:10Z,"come on, seeda lite, vill se rullen =)"
,misterb2000,2006-04-20T00:50Z,"what do i do to get it onto divx dvd after downloading?

,gfunk1975,2007-04-14T11:41Z,"Can anyone tell me how to download these movies, getting a bit stuck"
,colml,2007-05-06T18:32Z,"@ gfunk1975:

You have to first get a torrent client like utorrent. Type 'utorrent' into google and ul find it. Then when you click on the 'download this torrent' link it should  ask you what program you would like to use to open this. Choose utorrent. Thats it. You might have to tweak the settings in utorrent if ur behind a firewall or on a network to get good download speeds. "
