This band released in fact three albums with different names, the first as Flea in the Honey, with the members only identified with english nicknames, then as Flea, and later as Etna.
A group from Sicily, but based in Rome.

They reformed in 1975 as Etna, releasing an eponymous album with another radical change of style. 
Etna is a jazz-rock inspired work, with seven all instrumental tracks, showing strong influences by the likes of Mahavishnu Orchestra and coming close to the work of similar italian bands like Nova or Il Baricentro.
Soon after the album, drummer Agostino Marangolo joined Goblin and had a successful later career as sessionman, Pennisi briefly played with Mediterraneo.

The album was originally released on Gatica and re-issued on CD the those great people at Mellow Records, even if they never do answer my emails!:)brainticket
