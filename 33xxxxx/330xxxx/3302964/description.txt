A Miike film that is to a degree autobiographical, Young Thugs - Innocent Blood follows three school friends through their first year after leaving. After robbing their teacher on their last day at school, Ryoko gets a job in a hair salon, while the two boys settle down to a career of enforcement and protection. 
Set in Kishiwada, a fishing district in the industrial town of Osaka, Innocent Blood lives up to its title. A lot of blood gets splattered around without anyone getting too badly hurt or taking too much offence. This is a story of rough kids trying to find their way in the world, a world of violence, sentiment and comedy, in a film that moves at a cracking pace from the opening shot.
