,ascentrino,2005-04-15T16:25Z,"Wouldnt it be easyier, if one of you (who has the disc key) jo just enter it here, so that the rest of us can get going?"
,Hamads,2005-04-20T18:09Z,Just copy all 3 files from the crack dir on the CD to the folder the game is installed in... Then it works...
,JayB33,2005-05-11T00:13Z,"Data11.cab is the main package of the setup, totaling 1.2 GB. Although there is probably nothing wrong with the actual release itself; the image file has downloaded corrupt for me more than once (tested in Azureus and BitTornado amongst others). I suspect foul play; especially since the OTHER main Silent Hunter III torrent on the Pirate Bay tracker has downloaded corrupt for me in a similar manner, yet many other torrents around here appear to be fine."
,powerman100,2005-05-18T23:54Z,"Jag vill bara tacka, är nöjd med spelet,funkar bra, roligt och är bara nöjd...:-)
