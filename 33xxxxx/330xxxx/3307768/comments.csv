,muddled,2005-03-28T05:53Z,"wow, that is a whole lot of uploading. Thanks so much!"
,Astralia,2005-03-28T14:36Z,"agreed, this is one of the best (if not THE best) scifiseries ive ever watched.Great u/l even tho i already have the complete series and the mini. :) 5/5"
,Shute,2005-03-28T22:20Z,"No disrespect but whats wrong with the farscape torrents thats already active? 4 seperate torrents, original release with perfect quality. The last 2 episodes are also up..

I love the series and really appreciate you uploading it. Still I wonder why you didn't just help with the already existing torrents. Is this some special version of Farscape or..?"
,WarBunny,2005-03-29T00:37Z,"ther is only 1 torent whid ale the epesods (http://www.thepiratebay.org/download.php/3269017/Farscape%20Season1%2C2%2C3%2C4.torrent)
and it`s 0 seders and 45 leechers so whay dont seed ale the epesods in 1 torent 
( and i dident whant to rename my epesods to fit the axisting torents cale me lasy )"
,Shute,2005-03-29T00:55Z,"Haha, thats a funny spelling! :)

Yea, ok. I guess it's nice with a torrent with the complete thing for those who don't have the energy to dl the seasons seperately. As long as all torrents continue to have seeders I guess it's fine.."
,ziq-,2005-03-30T15:31Z,"Nice UL, im soon done :D:D:D"
,cccp90,2005-04-14T18:09Z,tack för världens bästa serie tack tack
,naken,2005-04-20T06:00Z,"Hows the quality on the episodes ?

Are they divX ?"
,WarBunny,2005-04-20T19:51Z,All rips are HQ TV or DVD rips.
,WarBunny,2005-08-08T22:33Z,"gona seed for 3 days agen

,ezdy,2006-04-20T20:37Z,"Torrent:  122.3 / 30744.4 MB Rate: 189.2 /  90.0 KB Uploaded:   453.6 MB [ 0%]  4:00:46

wow. a complete farscape in 4 days on a 5Mbit connection! Pity there are no more than 50 peers (and 2-3 complete copies) at once ..."
,phxcityslick,2006-06-13T10:26Z,Lets hope so because last peace keeper wars i downloaded the Audio and video were off
,fnog,2006-06-14T01:25Z,dame the link to download wont work.
,fnog,2006-06-14T20:27Z,wow can you say 0 peers?
,hopelessloser,2006-06-28T07:49Z,i noticed that this torrent's files are windows media files and was wondering if they could be written to DVD-Rs and be viewed with DVD players and the like. This is the first torrent like this that I have downloaded and I am not sure how they work. Any help would be much appreciated.
,proudtitania,2006-07-14T18:11Z,"Burning windows media files to DVD-R's will probably only work if you're using a burning program like Toast or Nero. Just burning the files themselves onto a DVD-R will just make a data DVD so you'll only be able to read the files on your computer. If you have a burning program, look in the documentation to see if it will accept windows media files, because I'm not sure all of them do."
,oceanofdarkstars,2006-09-08T09:51Z,"Hey Could Someone Maybe Mail this To Me Seeing As How I Have The Crappiest Dial-Up Con 


Email Me If U Can. Do U Know How Long I've Been Looking For Just this Thing. Too Long.....Oh yeah The Email: Oceanofdarkstars@yahoo.com 

I'll Be Willing To Mail U Anything I Have"

Not if you have one of those fancy DVD players that can play MPEG, DiVx, and other video codecs!  Then you can just put your Data DVD in the drive and FULL SCREEN BABY!!  ;)"
,diddyu,2007-01-12T21:14Z,"My dvd player plays most codecs and formats (oog is a bit glitchy at times). I got it for 200 USD at sams club w/a pretty good surround included in that 200 bucks. Schweet!!! Back on track, I dont have enough room on my hard drive, so I hope this is still here when I get me another."
,diddyu,2007-01-12T21:17Z,"I forgot to add, just download ""ConvertXtoDvD"", its very easy and fast (~2x convert times) it also adds a root menu, very handy."
,e_voyager,2007-08-16T07:30Z,i don't supposes anyone has seen season five have they? 
,s331o,2007-10-07T02:01Z,"oceanofdarkstars: I really hope you're joking, lol"
,guitarguru101,2007-10-21T07:11Z,only four seasons unfortunately bro i wish there was more too only the movie (peacekeeper wars)
,Mr.Bais,2007-11-08T16:08Z,"Hi

Thx!
Mr:Bais"
,monkist,2008-01-17T22:41Z,"seasons 1 2 and 3 are not working, it says unexpected error and shuts down my media player, rest works fine.. still gay for a week of downloading and 30 gigs of files.. anyone have any ideas?"
,lostgarou,2008-03-17T02:08Z,Thanks for the dl im going to seed for a few days after i get it downloaded. Will let everyone know what the quality is as i find out.
,QuarkGamer,2008-04-04T00:57Z,"Wow! Torrent started in 2005 and still have people commenting. But this is a good thing, my gf just deleted Peacekeeper Wars off my DVR to free up memory (I hate american idol even more now). If all the files work i'll seed this for months."
,cew006,2008-04-06T22:28Z,"Seeding 24/7 from the pacific northwest, except when I browse the web (avg 1-3hrs per day). Farscape forever! :]"
,Suicider1981,2008-04-27T22:05Z,"Just wondering...does anyone know a torrent for the actual dvd's? Just came across to a torrent, with the covers for all of the 4 season dvd's, but seems that no-one has uploaded them...I know that it would be a HUGE torrent, since each season has 6 dvd's. (That's 25 discs total...)
But this one is a great upload too. 
Thanx to WarBunny for the upload!"
,WarBunny,2008-05-17T11:01Z,ok
,worldidiot,2008-05-19T21:03Z,"unfortunately for me, after downloading this, I have the same error as Mr Bais, could someone help me pls."
,worldidiot,2008-05-19T21:04Z,"sorry, not mr bais, monkist :oops:"
,Scullyy,2008-08-02T15:57Z,mm it's all good.
[T],despo1ler,2008-10-12T23:39Z,"if you have trouble playing media files try VLC media player, freeware from www.videolan.org  
it will play just about any video format or codec I've ever encountered"
,rc71,2008-12-15T04:04Z,"Thanks for the upload.

If you can, please seed.
Two months and I'm at 75%.  "

,Mufasa11,2009-03-16T20:57Z,"This series is AMAZING.

,Doomtrigger1,2009-05-15T21:43Z,you mother fudgers need to seed shit im only getting 15 kbs and i am connected to 5 seeders  so that tells ME ONLY 5 PPL ARE SEEDING
,senseless06,2009-05-28T17:36Z,"Would be nice to know what damn codec was used to encode these... I cant get them to play with anything, ive tried all media players from divx player, windows media, vlc, media player classic, etc. I've tried a number of codec packs with no dice. Wtf is the deal? Did i just download 30 gigabytes of shit?"
,senseless06,2009-05-28T18:03Z,"Ignore that last comment of mine. I'm an idiot.
"
,senseless06,2009-05-28T18:51Z,"No, I was right the first time. Whoever encoded these used some jacked off the wall codec (not standard divx). It'll play in divx player... But that's it. The rest of my programs don't even attempt to load it. Which means it's 30 GB of shit since I download to a server and play online to my house from there.. "
,FluxCapacitor,2009-05-30T18:52Z,"um i think you are missing an episode.

""S01E14 - Jeremiah Crichton"" and ""S01E15 - Durka Returns"" are the same episode!

I guess you are missing 1x14.  I will try to get it from another torrent."
,FluxCapacitor,2009-05-30T19:19Z,sorry - my mistake - they are not the same episode
,eloH2,2009-07-08T13:29Z,"looking at the file list, it appears that this was pieced together from numerous different rips and has differing codecs and resolutions from episode to episode-
are there any that i should know of that are shitty quality so i can fire up the appropriate torrents to replace them? tia"
,tech1jones,2009-07-22T02:30Z,Thanks WarBunny... When it was on I only caught part of a couple episodes.... this  makes my year that much easier to endure.
,msjwozere,2009-07-22T14:16Z,I will seed this at 100mbps if I can ever download it!
,msjwozere,2009-07-23T23:39Z,"speed:     96.9  K/s down -   1.1  M/s up
totals:     9.7  G   down -  74.1  G   up

Slightly unfair I think ;(

Seed please! :D"
,Zigzagfrosty,2009-10-10T00:23Z,Mine is only playinf audio.  What codec are these in?
,bendlein,2009-11-25T21:06Z,"Missed the series when it was on tv.After downloading this and watching part of the first series.Bought all 4 series boxsets on dvd,really enjoyable for any Sci Fi fan.Thanks for the up."

,mateomiguel,2011-03-08T02:00Z,Is there something different about these avi files?  I can play every other .avi file on my android phone but not these. I had to download several different video players onto my android before I found one that would play these files.
,dontpKaniC,2011-03-10T09:18Z,thanx man!!! i used to watch it when it first started!!! it will be great to remember the good old days

Downloaded 1.23 GB
Uploaded 3.33

So I've uploaded every thing I've downloaded twice. lol? 

I'll probably seed this one just because of the horrible ratio. And like, I'm already sort of seeding so XD"
,BadSwe,2011-08-09T03:38Z,Pffft... No Good WarBunny! Have no tracker-info in ur torrent= VERY poor seed... Leaving it to only DHT... Learn and do better!
,GadsdenNation,2011-08-16T09:05Z,Thanks for uploading. I totally forgot about this series until my sister mentioned giving her box set to our mom. I'm not going to jump on the wagon and say that there is a need for more seeders.... but.... there's a need for more seeders....
,kola65,2011-09-06T23:27Z,"Second time i download this fantastic series.
