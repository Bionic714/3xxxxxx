I am going to seed this till 500% then, I will combine these three cd's and start a new torrent I think it was really lame the uploader didnt do this (BTW) but.... otherwise all is well and its a solid download ...I gave you 5 stars. Only reason Im doing this is for those who are on old pc's OR have bought one as a second PC like me,,,, and want some cool games like this to play on it. ;)
