hmm ja planerar flytta det från pc till mac....går det bra att bara bränna dem (data-skiva) o sen öppna på macen i OS X ?
Om inte...finns det nåt bra progg som bränner .dmg på pc?

tacksam för svar

,MacWarez,2005-03-21T18:38Z,"Leta reda på TransMac så ska du kunna bränna dmg (Disk ImaGe) filer med PC. Jag har inte testat.

http://www.asy.com/scrtm.htm

Har du DVD-brännare? I så fall bränner du alla dmg filerna som de är och mountar dem i Mac OS ungefär som man gör med Daemon Tools i en PC."
,Wheat,2005-03-21T20:55Z,"Du behöver ju Toast för att mounta dem som i Daemon tools, men även det finns ju i vår nya fantastiska Mac kategori. Annars om du har datorerna i nätverk är det  bara att överföra. Men annars funkar det att bränna dem som filer på en skiva och sen mounta, troligen enklast.

Lycka till!"
,Aldrian,2005-03-21T21:13Z,"Tack för svaren!

Har ju inte dvdbrännare där tyvärr. 
Det här transmac verkar spännande, om det funkar, ska testa det. Har laddat hem toast också för att gardera mig :D"

Det ska väl Skivverktyg klara av automatiskt?"
,Wheat,2005-03-24T16:51Z,"
Jag har lite probs med installeringen. Nån som kan ge mig lite tips? den frågar efter nya skivor även fast jag har installerat alla skivor.

,Unik,2005-03-31T10:20Z,"Jag har också problem, den vill att jag stoppar in cd 2 när jag startar spelet och jag har redan mountat den?"
,meluvsj00,2005-05-02T19:24Z,"hey, im having problems with installation, it says i dont have enough privileges for that install... but im logged as admin. I tried mounting it on toast but nothing. either on osx or os9. any suggestion?"
,wveil,2005-07-30T02:57Z,Hi. I need help. I downloaded everything just fine. But when I go to play it asks me to insert disc 2.  How do I get around this? I opened all four cds.  Thanks.
,Crust,2005-08-03T17:54Z,JAG VILL HA TILL PC!!!!  mweeep
,Andtalath,2006-01-04T10:16Z,"The problem with the discs was simple, just right-click and mount them, but I still haven't found a way to make a full install, do I can't install ToB.
Help?"
,Andtalath,2006-01-04T10:41Z,"That problem was resolved by installing with classic, don't know why though (poor OSX installer probably)."
,nimbus123,2006-01-07T00:12Z,Sometimes you have to burn the CD to play. That's what I had to do. Mounting it wasn't enough.
,nimbus123,2006-01-07T00:14Z,"Btw, anyone got Bladur's Gate 1? and/or any expansions? I've got Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal and played through them both, but I can't find the first game for macintosh."
,Angels Cry,2006-03-15T14:49Z,"""Sometimes you have to burn the CD to play. That's what I had to do. Mounting it wasn't enough.""
You can mount the CD with toast, that works"
,Angels Cry,2006-03-15T15:21Z,"I can't install ToB, I've also tried with the classic mode, but nothing happened.. Can somebody help? It says I haven't installed fully Baldur's Gate, while I did the installation from all four CDs.."

,WhoKnows,2006-07-29T19:00Z,"Just in case someone didn't get it.
Yes, you will have to set the BG II folder as installation location if you install ToB."
,Grahamdubya,2006-10-04T04:12Z,Does anybody know why this won't let me dl the torrent?
,clopin-pirate,2007-02-16T12:14Z,could someone please seed =)
,chascoll,2007-04-26T21:10Z,I love this game but i need people uploading so I can run this torrent
,chascoll,2007-04-26T21:25Z,I need seeders
,chascoll,2007-04-28T03:41Z,need seeders
,MrFelix,2007-07-28T18:44Z,Can anyone re-seed? I'm half done would really love to have this game.
,MrFelix,2007-07-31T18:44Z,"My download speed has gone really low, any chance of getting a re-seed/someone increase their upload speed k/s??

Also does anyone know if whilst downloading I cancel one of the componanets to make it quicker to download?"
,Mullenkamp,2007-09-14T06:07Z,"For those of you having problems installing ToB, you have to choose the 'maximum' installation for SoA.

The 1st disc automatically does a 'recommended' installation. But, when installing the 2nd disc, where it lets you choose the install destination, it will let you change to the 'maximum' installation in the top-left of the window.

Make sure you do this with discs 3 and 4 as well."
,zeelig,2007-10-09T09:44Z,"I would really appreciate a seeding effort as I am not moving form 0%
once this happens I will seed every day till new years.
:)"
,ReturnoftheRat,2007-10-11T20:50Z,"Now I kind of installed the expansion as well, I don't really know where though. Before I installed it, it kept asking for Disc II. Now it asks for the expansion disk? And I have the ToB disk mounted. What to do? Cookies and milk for any helpers."
,griftor,2007-12-20T04:52Z,"I am with Returnoftherat.  I tried burning disk two, and I tried mounting disk two and the expansion disk and nothing will let me play.

I reinstalled with the maximum installation and still nothing.  

Is there something specific I need to burn on disk 2 to make it work, (or now the expansion disk?) or what?

Any help is appreciated.  Thanks"
,griftor,2007-12-26T15:32Z,"All right, here's what I did.  

I downloaded Toast and then used Toast to create a disk image and it worked fine. I won't be back, but it was easy (and I suck at computers) so I hope that helps everyone.  Peace"
,theprins,2008-04-10T15:21Z,"I'm having truble running SoA, I burned cd2 on a disc and the game starts up just fine. But at the first autosaving point the game just crashes, anyone had this problem?"

,Xblaze,2008-05-03T03:51Z,Please seed i've been downloading for 3 days now and its at 20% :( thanks
,nprussin,2008-05-03T05:30Z,"    This torrent works in Leopard with a bit of work. I installed CD 1, which doesn't give you a choice of install size. Then I installed CD 2-4 and Throne of Bhaal (ToB) choosing Maximum Instillation for each. Then I burned the ToB CD to disk (I tried mounting it using Toast, but it didn?t work). 
    This game has a bug which won?t let you save after you have opened your inventory. To fix it, you have to do two things. First, exclude the BGII SoA folder from spotlight search. If you don?t know how to do this, search for ?spotlight? in the finder help and you?ll find a walkthrough. Second, you have to install The BG2 Tweak Pack from http://www.gibberlings3.net/downloads/index.php. Read the instructions and be patient with the patcher. 
    This is a good torrent for a great game. Keep seeding it."

,festiveb,2008-07-20T09:25Z,"HELP!  I downloaded the torrent, installed it, all that jazz, and I've been playing it perfectly fine.  UNTIL I head off to Umar Hills.  Then the game asks me to put in CD 3.  So I burned CD 3, named it Baldur's Gate II CD 3, and shoved it in there when the program asked me for it.  But then nothing happened.  I'm running Leopard if that makes any difference.  Any help would be much appreciated."
