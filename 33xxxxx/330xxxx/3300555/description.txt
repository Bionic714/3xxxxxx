Venus is the second planet from the Sun and the sixth largest. The name comes from the Roman goddess of love and beauty. Venus has been known since prehistoric times. It is the brightest object in the sky except for the Sun and the Moon. It was long thought of as the Earth's twin. Many believed that it contained a very earth-like environment. In reality the harsh conditions of Venus restrict our understanding of Earth's nearest neighbor. However, little by little, scientists are trying to unlock its secrets, uncovering the mysteries of the cloud-shrouded planet. Even so, it may be a long time before we really know our closest planetary neighbor.
Planet Venus 3D Screensaver is a great 3D model of the planet that will turn your desktop into the eyepiece of a powerful telescope.
