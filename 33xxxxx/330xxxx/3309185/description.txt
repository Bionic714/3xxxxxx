This is another Request by someone on the board. Queens Last Concert!. Everyone! awwww. End of an era. Although I am not a fan of the 86 tour and think by and large it was a money making tour with a greatest hits setlist, we do still have to acknowledge that this was the last one. 

Last Time Freddie did a "Day-o" 
Last Time he sang "Give it to me one more time!" 
Last Time he sang "Fried chicken!" 

so Here it is. Sound quality is good, Hope you enjoy it!
