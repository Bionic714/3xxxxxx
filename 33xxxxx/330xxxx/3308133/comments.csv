,TomMusic,2005-07-15T00:31Z,Why does the initial setup stop at 99%?
,Hey.man,2005-07-22T16:01Z,SEEDA
,dvncy,2005-07-29T16:29Z,It stopping at 99% is normal.. the legitimate version did that as well.  You just have to let it sit there for awhile and it finally finishes.  I think I heard someone say that it takes five minutes or somesuch..

,yasysay,2005-08-12T02:16Z,I had a problem with cd 2 as well so what I did was typed in the error in Google and what do u know I found the solution to that problem. It's a program that goes by the name CDCHECK. I ran the cab file on cd 2 through the cdcheck program and what do ya know it fixed it. However when I try to play the game with the cd crack patch installed it throws an error as well. Can't mount w32model.pod: File is corrupt File: podmain Line:221 So if anyone knows how to work around this error please let me know.
