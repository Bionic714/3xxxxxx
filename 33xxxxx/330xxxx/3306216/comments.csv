I would love to see a version of Motion 3 from Lynda.com on here.

I loved the FCP 6 training series.

I guess I'll buy it."
,zarigueyo,2010-04-15T07:12Z,"I am using Motion 3 from Final Cut Studio 2 (I think the new FCS 3 has Motion 4):

This tutorial IS a bit outdated (there is no mention of 3D, for instance, which is fully available in Motion 3) but for beginners I would reccomend it, so far (I am in chapter 2 of 4) all the exercises can be followed and you learn something.

Also, it's less than 300 Mb, I think it's not much for a torrent (and a tutorial with videos).  I am seeding it now..."
