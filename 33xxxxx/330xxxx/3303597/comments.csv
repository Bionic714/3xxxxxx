,cribbon,2005-04-05T21:14Z,"Det behövs fler som delar ut hela, vi är 4 st på ca 50% "
,bam359,2005-08-15T00:48Z,"CVonV:  dead_like_me.1x14.rest_in_peace.ws_dvdrip_xvid-fov.avi and dead.like.me.s01e15.hdtv-sfm.avi are the same episode. Its been included in the torrent twice under different filenames, but the content is the same.  (I think one might have a higher bitrate, but both files are the same size)"
,griggsy7,2006-01-09T14:30Z,Can someone please let me know if this series is in English? Thanks
,Ikaros_83,2006-01-11T19:34Z,Well at least they speak english if it´s the same series that I have seen earlier.
,JollyOdden,2008-04-04T01:05Z,"Yep the show's in english, must say I absolutely love it, especially the mix with the comedy and the deep existential issues adressed in the show in a brilliant way. And keep seeding folks this one should be available for everyone, a must-see in my opinion.

9.0/10 on ImdB

,speedknot292003,2009-02-12T11:05Z,Why in the fuck can't I delete s01e15?!?!
,Geburah,2009-03-13T00:53Z,"Try renaming the fileextention to .bak or something, then delete it. (windows doesn't like DivX and Xvid...)"
