,test78,2005-04-02T10:53Z,"The movie looks great.

 A russian/german movie without any subs (not counting the slovenian subs included in the release coz uhmm my understanding of slovenian is kinda crap) is pointless tho. Does anyone know where to get proper english/danish/swedish subs for this release?

Thanx for the upload anyway - a very nice rip :)

PS! Knaster: if you dont get proper sound do something ta make sure you arent getting surroundsound in your stereospeakers cos that will f**k things up"

og ellers tak for filmen, jeg ser frem til at se den."
,test78,2005-04-10T10:10Z,The english subtitles above are for another release. They are completely out of sync for this rip :-/
