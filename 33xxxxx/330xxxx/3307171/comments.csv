,ghandi253,2011-07-14T06:57Z,"First, how can a movie that is not even in theaters be on DVD. More than likely this is a fake. Second, Rochie, don't listen to those dumbasses. More than likely they have always wanted to fuck Smurfette in the ass just like you and me. They're just too pussy to say it though. Scare-dy, cat fucks."
,gnomethrower84,2011-07-30T18:15Z,"@ghandi253 
     you 're a fucking retard this isn't the movie from the theater it's the cartoon from back in the day and you and rochie are sick fucks it's better to keep that sick shit to yourself for real!   great job on the copy though keep up the good work"
