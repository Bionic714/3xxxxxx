,iceon,2005-06-05T17:09Z,"It's a awsome thing here =D

But I am missing something aswell, it is a comic where Magica puts a spell over Donald and Scroodge and it makes them forget a certain word in a sentence, I do not remember the name of it, but I could not find it in the file, and its a little bad since it is according to me the best one ever =D"
,xarragon,2005-06-09T21:30Z,"The torrent contains MANY files, and since BT wants to keep them all open at the same time, the maximum number of open files are exceeded.

This causes the following error (with the original Python scripts): ""Too many open files"".

On Linux (debian unstable), the default limit is 1024 open files. The current value can be checked with the 'ulimit -n' command from the shell.

To increase this limit you must be root, so you could either run the BT scripts as root (foolish!), or modify the '/etc/security/limits.conf' file. This file is read by PAM (handles security), and upon the next login, you will get all the file descriptors you need.

I added the following line to '/etc/security/limits.conf"":
'xarragon hard nofile 8192'
This increased my maximum open file limit to 8192, which was sufficient for this torrent.

Hoped this helped you out. If you are on Windos, I don't belive I can help you..."
,che_boludo,2005-07-04T00:59Z,can someone help me out by seeding this. thanks so much!!

,Aeblehjem,2010-06-14T16:28Z,"Nice! I'm a huge Donald duck and especially Don Rosa fan, so Thanks a ton for uploading this!

Issues that I met during this download:
I had to force start the torrent at least 30+ times because of the error that the requested operation cannot be performed.
I found viruses on following pages:
- Once and Future Duck, page 13
- Donald Duck - Super Snooper Strikes Again, page 8
- Donald Duck - From Duckburg to Lillehammer, page 3

And for some reason I can't download Cash Flow, page 5 because it wouldn't scan properly. 
So i'm missing a few pages, but the rest works :)

Thanks again for sharing, very much indeed! '

Cheers,
-Aeblehjem"
