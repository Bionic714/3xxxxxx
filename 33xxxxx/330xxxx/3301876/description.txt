Digital TV Capture.

I am going to seed a few "older" videos before capturing and seeding this weeks new releases.

Before I put up this weeks new releases I will try and release all my bandwidth to flush out peers still getting the old releases.

Please stay seeding when you have finished downloading so I can release more videos, more often!  I have been capturing for a while now and have close to 500 high quality digital tv captures.  I have also kept the original uncompressed MPEG2 files so when codecs get better I can re-encode.
