,feelium,2005-03-30T00:10Z,"NewsPiper is a RSS/Web news reader and news ticker in one environment. This program can show news from different sources: Web-pages (like cnn.com, foxnews.com, etc.) or RSS news feeds. Retrived news are shown in usual three-panes newsreader interface (channels, news titles, news details) and in a special news ticker bar (News Bar) placed at the top of your desktop.

NewsPiper also checks your connection status on the schedule that you set up, and changes the color of the icon in the system tray bar accordingly. Green means your are online; red indicates offline status. It can also read headlines and details aloud.

This new version (v3.3.7) adds a ""New"" label for unread news in NewsBar, an ability to mark each news as read, a News option: that allows the number of views for news to be marked as read and various bug fixes.
