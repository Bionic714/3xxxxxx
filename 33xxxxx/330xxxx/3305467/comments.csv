,superboppe,2005-03-23T16:35Z,berättar ni inte mer om spelet blir jag arg! finns det ingen information på internet om detta spel? är det typ så att man ser två snubbar från sidan och sen slåss dom fram och tillbaka som street fighter?
,orel.bi,2005-03-23T16:41Z,"i think ther is a street fighter bout only 1 player from ther!!

aobut 150 players!!! and about 80 Levels!!"
,vizzerdix1,2005-03-23T21:09Z,Är det as dålig grafik eller?? För den e ju as liten!! 
,WooshaQ,2005-03-23T21:16Z,Is it that difficult to write and warn it is ordinary mugen? Besides who wants DBZ character there? :> You could at least add some normal characters...
,vizzerdix1,2005-03-23T21:24Z,"Är spelet kul eller??
"

,JelloB200,2005-03-25T00:08Z,"Think its just the game folder itself without the installer. Its beta trial copy that cant be configured because ""evaluation"" time is over (or because of xp, its a 4 year old mugen)."

,vizzerdix1,2005-03-25T10:36Z,Yes!!! You must give us the setup file.......  
,orel.bi,2005-03-25T12:40Z,"Well its the foldier cuz its take time to made tht open with XP Sp1/Sp2

so i crack tht and uplaod tht link up me...XD

have Fun bors u can down load tht install from here

bout ist not a 100% work on XP!!!!"
,JelloB200,2005-03-25T21:14Z,"ffs start using a spellcheck. No you didnt crack it, you just uploaded your folders that have a ton of shitty characters.

""Dragon Ball Z Fighters Against Capcom"" is a complete mugen game but I have managed to find only broken links for it. This monkey has that but added a ton of crap (no installer) & now its just a mess.

Search for a patched winmugen on google, that works much better. This is the dos version of mugen with alot of crap characters in char folder."
,Zbzzn,2005-03-27T03:44Z,"I got it to work fine, no problems whatsoever, but why? This game is horrible. It reminds me of the early Korean made Street Fighter 2 hacks with ugly sprites ripped from the Super Famicom game.

All of the character are extremely low resolution, unbalanced in power, of non-uniform sizes (imagine a 4 meter tall Mortal Kombat character) and full of graphical glitches.

Take it from me, it's NOT worth the download."
