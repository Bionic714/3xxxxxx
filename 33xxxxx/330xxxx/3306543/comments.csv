and Icelandic"
,TwistBD,2005-04-04T14:30Z,"A little disappointing to find that Finnish and Icelandic subs are removed(why?, I might ask), therefore this isn't a Nordic release even if the original DVD was. Thanks anyway."
,Pรถks,2005-08-02T16:27Z,Is there or isn't there Finnish subtitles?
,barton101,2012-08-07T13:44Z,"Next time, please include English subtitles for the hearing impaired. They are also good for people who don't have English as their first language. Subtitles take up hardly any extra space and they make for more seeders because the torrent is useful to more people."
