,Kovski,2005-03-28T02:55Z,Väldigt konstnärlig skräck/splatterfilm. Mycket bra screenplay och skrämmande även om man ser den mitt på ljusa dagen. 
,Thrax,2005-03-28T08:06Z,"thx, never seen this one!"
,d-pad,2005-06-28T16:46Z,"i quite like this... reminds me of the glory days of horror flicks (texas chainsaw, last house, etc...). the sequel looks cool - less horror, more vigilante exploitation!
the sequel is called ""devils rejects"" keep an eye out for it"
,L_Langster,2005-07-23T12:45Z,If you go to IMDb you can read about The Devils Reject. Looks creepy enough....... I think I'll wait for that one to download...
