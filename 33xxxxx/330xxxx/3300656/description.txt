The dark side of Alice in Wonderland!

If you believe that the Alice in Wonderland fable is a delightful children's story and you want to CONTINUE to believe that then you really should not see this Czechoslavakian film.
This is Alice when she ate too much of those mushrooms the caterpillar was pushing.

This variation of Alice in Wonderland, directed by the Czech animator Jan Svankmajer, is probably the most bizarre version of Lewis Carroll's work ever before seen, a blend of live action and stop motion animation.
