I mean.. what with the magic mushrooms and a Hookah-smoking caterpillar and everything.  So if this is an even more fucked up version of Alice in Wonderland, I have to check it out!  

Thanks for your fucked-up flicks.  Marry me?"
,vickyz,2005-03-12T03:41Z,Temptation: Sorry..iÂ´m already married ;)
,foomonger,2005-03-12T05:46Z,"Temptation,

hey, funny you should mention the Disney version, I've got that running sweet over at torrentbox, if you don't have a copy, it's still live, grab it!

It is pretty wild, but then, so is that drunken scene from Dumbo. Man! I'd like a digital copy of that!

many thanks to yourself and the seedy buggers, i'll be joining them myself now.. (-;"
,micahret,2008-09-15T17:08Z,Someone seed this please! Seeding at 3.0 is crap! Would it hurt for you to seed a little?
,rogerpP,2008-09-24T16:16Z,"Many thanks again, d/l now."
,nbx326,2008-09-28T00:19Z,"This was awesome, will continue to seed. Thank you very much."
,Smokeyjones,2008-09-28T01:14Z,"Come on dam leeches, Seed!!!"
,valerieG,2008-09-28T13:09Z,"Reseeding my download of it 09-28-08 and when online. Just watched it and very good quality.

You should also mention it contains Jan Svankmajer's short film 'Darkness, Light, Darkness' after the credits. That was a nice bonus."
,planetbleu,2009-04-14T03:40Z,"I like your choices off films and i have been into experimental stuff for long and "" BEGOTTEN "" ,
 "" ERASERHEAD "" and all kinds off weird movies 
are amongs my kind o movies so i think you should give a look at "" 13 TZAMETI "" its a french film and its quite unique , another suggestion is 
"" SEUL CONTRE TOUS "" from Gaspar NoĂŠ , he made the contraversial film called   ""IRREVERSIBLE "" and wat a movie that was , WOW!! 
  Di you see "" COME AND SEE "" and "" BAD BOY BUBBY "" ? these two films are some ofmy favorite weird films  , not to forget "" TETSUO THE IRON MAN ""  ....these are what i would consider pretty weird films ....so give me some feedback and some suggestions on the weird dept ....."
,drclgr,2009-07-13T13:05Z,"Unfortunately, this one has the English OVERDUB, there's no Czech audio."
,saturneye,2010-12-12T15:26Z,"Thank You so much for this! 

I remembered seeing a really messed up AIW movie when I was a little kid. I was looking around on wikipedia trying to figure out which one it was. And this is it! downloading it now. "
,mcreed24,2010-12-27T18:42Z,"Well i was first struck by Svankmajers ""Otesanek "" when it was on late night television years ago and it slipped out my memory (name being a bit too obscure to remember from 3am lol) but after reading up on him I found out hes adapted several classic stories...this being one and Faust also :) so I hope this is as good as I hope"
,Pitpocket1,2012-04-19T07:42Z,Thanks !
