,cranial2,2005-04-01T19:23Z,"10 mb/s download then but your upload speed is probably much lower.  1 Byte is 8 bit or 6? i dont remember however the speeds shown in your Torrentclient is measured in KiloBytes so 60 kB/s is about 480 kb/s (B= Byte b=bit) confusing I know. Your internet service advertises with Mega bits per sec. So only if you have special lines in your neighbourhood you can get 100mbit over your DSL. So what's important for Torrents is your upload speed. 100 kB/s is a good one i think. Where I live (Korea)  internet is a bit ahead on the rest of the world so thats why we have fat pipes for households. down and up 100 mbit. :-) anyways these questions you should ask at a forum, not here... www.filesoup.com is the biggest forum where people can help you answer your questions.

In french, we have hundreds of word to say your ""f"" word in a way that doesn't make it sound like trash. When screaming your ignorance, do it with style - or shut the fuck up.

,archiski,2008-03-05T07:33Z,This program is super buggy and crashes on 50% of the selections
,Hootyea,2008-04-12T08:46Z,"I know it's probably too late to add, but..

French is the #2 most common national language.  Doesn't mean the most people speak it, it means it ranks 2nd for Official National Languages.

English is First.
French, second."
,ha-nocri,2008-04-29T16:46Z,"Is this program vista - compatible? because when i try to install it i get ""installation wizard was interrupted"" and the installation just ends. I have vista 32 business and have used daemon tools to mount first cd. Am i doing something wrong? Thanks in advance, i'd really like to use this prog. "
,Tizer,2008-05-18T00:00Z,"to quote Verbato:
wtf?! Who speaks french?? There's like one country in the world were they speak french: france, and the only reason they do that is beacuse they have so little money and are so poor that most of them are illiterate and can't speak english. Who'd want to learn french anyways?! Freakin losers...

Well I for one do! and for your info don't class people losers, in the end yo are the only one who's the supreme loser! I never thought in this day we would still have the pleasure of living amongst basic swamp life! The power of language and expression is the only way I can describe it. Ignorance is bliss and in your case you probably just drowned in it!
Viva la France et la langue francais!"
,AxelVanHorn,2008-05-18T15:23Z,"Verbato
That wa the most complex comment i ever read on torrents,
I would really liek to know in which country people like you can be found.

,staysy,2008-11-10T00:31Z,"Thanks a lot for torrent. Works fine on XP. Unfortunately, it doesn't on Vista. Crashes on installation, troubles with directx.. 
My solution: 
1. Installed MS Virtual PC 2007 on Vista.
2. Installed XP with SP3 on Virtual PC.
3. Installed Power ISO on XP.
4. Mounted files and installed Deluxe.

Cheers for torrent! I'm seeding."
,Piratebay1981,2009-01-03T11:59Z,"Anonymus_1 you are correct, there is lodz of people speaking french, take for example Canada. If you Verbato dont wana learn french then dont, but keep your silly comments for yourself."
,thekane77,2009-03-10T13:38Z,Verbato is it really necessary? it only shows how stupid you really are...
,NsiK,2009-04-06T18:36Z,I don't think is relevant to discuss how big the french language is. If you don't like the torrent. Don't download it and don't comment.  
,spyinDacab,2009-04-24T11:50Z,"By the way Verbato is Finnish if anyone asked.

,spyinDacab,2009-04-24T11:52Z,Sorry my mistake he is not
,remingtonha,2009-04-25T20:42Z,"Hey I agree with Verbato, who the hell wants to learn to speak French...OK, maybe it is a very pretty sounding language and a vast amount of English words come from french but who cares about that.  Why would anyone want to travel to France to speak it...OK, maybe there is alot of history there, and the architecture is absolutely amazing.  Maybe traveling the coutryside can be relaxing and refreshing and the wine is what all others are compared to, but who cares about that?  I can barely speak english correctly why learn another language like french.  OK, maybe there is that whole self development aspect and enriching ones life with knowledge.  Even for the truly oportunistic, there is nothing like impressing a date with a few french words falling from your lips (and eventually some french something else from your tongue :) )  But who cares about that? I'm with you Verbato, all we need is our little crichety rocking chair on our dirt encrusted screen porch, a few bottles of homemade fermented barley and a nice girly picture magazine to entertain ourselves while in the Outhouse (I think you french call it the latrine) since my sister...I mean wife doesn't do it for me anymore ever since she balloned to 500lbs (she just sits in from of the TV watching Jerry Springer now).  That's all anyone needs...oh, and a library card so that we can use the community computer there to download porn and tell the world how useless French is.  "
,metalboy94,2009-07-06T13:18Z,verbato is just a fuckin racist bitch.

@verbato - Do us all a favor and jump of the tallest building closest to you. Morons like you should not be aloud to breed."
