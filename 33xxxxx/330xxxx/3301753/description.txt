Images was an attempt to reach for crossover sales for Phil Woods and while it can be argued that even a pop-jazz version of Windmills of Your Mind by Phil Woods is better than most versions by lesser mortals, it still falls short - despite the Grammy notoriety. The strings are are just a little thickly laid on in this recording for most Phil Woods' fans. That said, the title cut Images should be in the dictionary as the example for "Tour De Force"! Not only is the piano playing by LeGrand exemplary, but the ballad section is one of the most beautiful written. And of course, Woods shows on this one cut that all the other pretenders to the Alto Sax God throne are just that, pretenders. The title cut is clearly worth the price of admission.
