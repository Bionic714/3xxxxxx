,Jeff,2005-03-31T11:39Z,"And this game becomes even better with The Wake Of Gods (WOG) which can be found here: http://www.strategyplanet.com/homm/wog/
You install it over HoMM3 Complete and getalot of new features, campaigns, possibilities. Hand coded by some Germans, i think. Really awsome. If you like Heroes 3, you definitely like WoG!"

For anyone sitting on the fence on this game: Get it! You won't be disappointed.

Best of the HoMM series and a treat if you like strategy games. Make sure you have a lot of free time , though - once you start playing you'll have a hard time stopping. This is one of those games where you go 'just one more turn, then I'll save and quit' right upto 3 in the morning."

,awefui391,2011-04-08T15:49Z,"Thanks for the torrent!

I have a strange bug, which is partly what stopped me playing the game a few years ago as it was happening then (from original install CD, latest patch). Every week one of the two heroes you can recruit from the tavern should be from your town type. ie if you're Castle, you should have Cleric or Knight appearing once every week.

In my case, it seems to go wrong on the second level of a campaign. On level 2 of the first Good campaign of the original RoE campaigns, it's always giving me Ranger heroes.

It's a big annoyance, and a complete game-breaker when you're on one of the Evil campaigns where you have to collect something like 1000 skeletons; the inability to have a hero (of undead town type) who can do the resurrection thing where dead opponents turn to skeletons makes it virtually impossible to complete that level.

Anyone recognise the bug and have any suggestions?"
,sika6,2011-04-09T13:37Z,"I've read all the comments and info and i got a problem. I'm on a mac running parallels, and inside the folder when I double cilck the heroes3 icon the game starts, but it says something about needing a CD maybe i'm doing somehting wrong.

,d_Cut,2011-06-25T11:42Z,"Hey, I've got a solution for the campgain promblem(although a bit amateurish).

So I can save, but when I complete one campaign and start on an other one, the game doesn't remember that I have outed one campaign already, so I can't go onto the final campaigns.

Loading the last save doesn't work either.

So I cheat. Beacuse it's the complete collection, I start on a campaign, hit tab, then type nwcredpill. After I complete a campaign, without exiting the game, I go onto the other campaigns, cheating again. If you don't exit, the game will finally let you play the unlockable ones.

Great game"

,dhadee126,2011-10-23T16:28Z,"Cant save your games?
solution: When the game is installed it does not create a required ""Games"" folder which allows the user to make saves for the game. In order to correct this problem, you will need to create a ""Games"" folder in the Heroes of Might & Magic III main directory. 

The 'Games' folder should be created in the following directory: C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Heroes of Might and Magic III\

It should look like this: C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Heroes of Might and Magic III\Games"
,Mangachaos,2011-12-19T08:57Z,"""It should look like this: C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Heroes of Might and Magic III\Games""
