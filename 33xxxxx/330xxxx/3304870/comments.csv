,Bedömaren,2005-04-01T05:16Z,Mer Chomsky tack
,Brandis,2005-04-14T21:38Z,WOW!! :O Listen to this one! Noam Chomsky and Alex Jones surely doesn't play in the same league! Alex Jones is just another stupid fat american! Jesus Christ!! :axe: Mr. Jones sure is one sick man!
,negativeions,2005-04-16T23:13Z,"Mother of God... that was embararssing. Alex Jones is one dumb mother fuck. Jones and Chomsky basically agreed on everything except at the end when they talked about guns Chomsky didn't agree on the stats Jones gives him so then he calls him a new world order sheik after the interview's over and continues to make fun of Chomsky. What a fucken idiot. Oh ya, you don't agree on a couple of statistics on guns and suddenly Chosmky is the devil. Completely ridiculous. Maybe the government in the states is trying to limit guns because they want to limit the people's means of rebellion or retalliation or whatever... that has nothing to do with the FACT that gun deaths in the U.S. are the  highest than anywhere in the world. This is a fucken fact. Farenhait 9/11 even has that figure in the film, I've seen it myself, Chomsky knows it. When you have that many guns in a country it's just inevitable that there will be more gun deaths. Goes to show how many guns people have in the states... Jones is bias towards guns or gun users... Maybe he doesn't know what a gun death is... retard."
,negativeions,2005-04-16T23:17Z,"Sorry, not Farenheit 9/11... it was Bowling for Columbne that had that figure. It was around 10,000 gun deaths per year. That's way higher than any country in the world."
,negativeions,2005-04-16T23:23Z,"In 2002, there were 30,242 gun deaths in the U.S:

    * 17,108 suicides (56% of all U.S gun deaths),
    * 11,829 homicides (39% of all U.S gun deaths),
    * 762 unintentional shootings (3% of all U.S gun deaths),
    * and 300 from legal intervention and 243 from undetermined intent (2% of all U.S gun deaths combined).

-Numbers obtained from CDC National Center for Health Statistics mortality report online, 2005.

Well, shit... that's a lot more than 10,000 ain't it now, Alex?"
,TheLeecher,2005-07-21T13:26Z,"the thing is that they like the americans to be occupied with manny things to discuss. That makes it easier for them to control everything. This is a thing that can be done in America, that because the American people normaly is a bit slow in their heads. The only group of people in America that is like the rest of the world is the black people. The white Americans know that and treat the black people like dirt. "
,fool_me_baby,2006-02-06T18:51Z,"I always thought Alex Jones was a a bit of a nutter but I liked his films. He acted like spoiled child that can´t handle being critisized.
I didn´t much like the subject matter advertisements either.

Noam rocked ofcourse!.."
,duhprane,2007-05-08T17:23Z,"Here Jones takes bait, rare indeed, funny how the comments above are ninnying about guns. Self described Liberals want to reduce the population of earth by force but also pretend to worry about ""gun deaths"". Make up your mind, exterminate the evil CO2 huffing humans with bioweaponized innoculations or depleted uranium... but OH NO dont shoot them... Shut the fuck UP, the entire left v right paradigm is false... Alex is great, not not so much here.... worth watching. Thank for the file."
,duhprane,2007-05-08T23:50Z,WTF - Chomsky is the one who has his guns data off here...listen closlely and look up gun data in the UK....you little hand wringers shouldnt lap Chomsky's CIA funded (MIT) balls so eagerly.
