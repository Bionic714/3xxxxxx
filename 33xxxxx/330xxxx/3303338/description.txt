Once again, Team n00bs brings you another fine release. 

Mac OS X Panther for CherryOS and PearPC ISO-n00b consists of 2 ISO images ready to be used with CherryOS or PearPC. Note that the other 2 CDs of Mac OS X are not included since only Mac developers require them (not to say the emulation cant handle them). 

Also included is the latest and fastest build of PearPC (JITC) since  CherryOS is not able to install the 2nd CD of Mac OS X via mounting. Read the nfo and SEED.
