I have put up 16 high quality scenery so far and would like to here from u what u think about it and what u would like to see more of."
,Dragone,2005-03-13T07:35Z,I think u should have put all of them in the same torrent insted of flooding the annonce page
,McMowgli,2005-03-13T10:01Z,It's very nice and upload FS2004 extra..but I would prefere too download 1 torrent. Maybe around 1GB is a good size too have! If it's larger than that you could part it!!!!
,iPEX,2005-03-13T14:40Z,"I dont like when I get one big torrent with alot of junk in it, thatÂ´s not the way I want to spend my speed."
,heffaklump,2005-03-14T18:35Z,I too prefer a larger file than many smal. With a modern bittorrent client like Azureus you can select what you want to download.
,iPEX,2005-03-15T01:54Z,"Ok, I will do this next time! maybe!
be happy that I take my time and my connection to share what I have instead of complaining!
