,Verbal41,2009-01-16T22:49Z,"The Original was really good, but with the extra tracks it's great. A specially the finishing track with a 13 minute long live-version of ""Life without you"".
I load this just to promote this song, for the good cause!"
,Gregavi,2009-07-20T01:48Z,Why MP3 for a Re-Mastered Disc? Why MP3 ever? Ever heard of FLAC? I guess MP3s are good if you're a teenager. Thanks anyway.
,Aaron3ous,2012-04-12T05:29Z,"""Why MP3 ever?""

Space? iPod compatibility? The fact that most people cannot (or only marginally) distinguish between the two, even on top-of-the-line audio equipment?

Though I guess if you like being an insufferable snob, FLAC is the way to go."
