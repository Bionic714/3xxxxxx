,pogojoe,2005-03-26T11:01Z,This movie requires the Vodei Multimedia Processor for proper playback. :yucky:
,M0vieMan,2005-03-26T11:22Z,So download Vodei and stop complaining. It's FREE! What's the freaking big deal?
,pogojoe,2005-03-26T13:46Z,"The BIG deal is that i dont watch my movies on my computer.
I either use my Xbox or my DVD player with divx/xvid support. Vodei sucks!"
,yoci,2005-03-28T22:08Z,I also only use my xbox to watch movies. why does people use other codecs than xvid...?

,skug,2006-01-08T00:52Z,Vodei isn't free... it has a trial period that fudges up the playback when the trial is over. Thanks for nothing...
