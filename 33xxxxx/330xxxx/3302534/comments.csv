,beatnick,2005-03-16T19:31Z,the movie sucked btw
,Kappa143,2005-03-16T19:44Z,"This is a really good movie, but what is this ""Final Edition"" thing?"
,watwegsw,2005-03-16T21:06Z,"""this movie sucked btw""

one of the best imo "
,Kazekage,2005-03-17T01:45Z,Plain and simple this just a orignal & badass movie :)
,WPW,2005-03-17T11:27Z,"""Final edition"" means it's a rip from the final edition dvd. Better picture quality and more extras and so on. Does anyone have a DVD-R of this? (Don't care about the extras, but the picure quality of this Final Edition is highly noticable on a projector)

You can see the difference in picture quality here: www.dvdbeaver.com"

,phonkyd3jv,2005-03-27T11:53Z,one of the best movies in a long time
,niblick,2005-03-27T17:30Z,"wow.

""old boy"" was brilliant, think it's gonna make me go back into the asian live action movie scene again - kinda been caught up in anime for a while now. 
well worth the downoad, gonna go see this one in the cinema it's that good.

brilliant rip as well, thanks ECHiZEN for another great release XD"
,zhixiong,2005-04-01T14:28Z,"One of the most thought provoking film ever came out from Korea. Oldboy was so good that Hollywood is doing a remake for it and releasing it in 2006.

The ending of Oldboy was well engineered and unexpected. Don't ask yours friends or check website for spoilers. Go watch yourself first."

,DMCFX35,2010-08-18T01:15Z,"@m172226
either you rename the sub file to exactly how the video file is called (Dont change the file format), or you VLC > Video > Subtitles > Add external subtitles.
Oh and by the way, learn how to fucking use google."
