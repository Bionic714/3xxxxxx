ingen lost episode 19 idag, tyvärr har abc bestämt sig för att köra repriser i 4 - 5 veckor, så ni som väntar gjör det i onödan, kommer runt 30 mars eller 9 april

no episode of lost this time, abc network has decided to show old episodes instead, so don't think you can see it, next one will be up around 30th of mars or 9th of april. 


Hell to ABC
