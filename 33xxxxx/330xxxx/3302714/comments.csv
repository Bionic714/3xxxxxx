,Ykalon,2005-03-17T00:42Z,Only spanish or?
,Fillz,2005-03-17T12:01Z,Det är väl ändå inte uppföljaren på Fallout? Bara för att handlingen utspelar sig efter kärnvapenkriget så betyder det inte att det är en uppföljare. Är Call Of Duty en uppföljare på Medal of Honor måntro? :)
,BBBScorpio,2005-03-17T12:15Z,Måste finnas engelska med denna.. måste.. fan om jag skall börja lära mig spanska.. jaja.. tar väl bara 1-2 veckor.. ;).. 
,Ykalon,2005-03-17T21:18Z,Bara en från gamla Black Isle var med under en KORT del av utvecklingen. Avståndet gjorde att det inte gick i längden. Spelet är för övrigt Tyskt. De har fortfarande inte gjort klart med en engelsk publisher.
,BBBScorpio,2005-03-18T22:50Z,Is there a english version of this game.. if so.. plz seed it.. or is there an english speech pack to put on.. anyone know?
,magnus777,2005-03-20T10:29Z,finns det på engelska????????
,hanki84,2005-03-31T14:52Z,GERMAN VERSION??!! ANYONE??? PLEASE!!!
,wedajm,2005-07-11T11:16Z,"There have to be a english version too. I found it on dc, but only 3 have it, and almost never online. If I get it home, I will seed it here for sure"
,Delos,2005-07-20T07:10Z,"Tmg3 is right, THERE IS NO ENGLISH VERSION YET.

There are Russian and German copies floating around so far though."
,Opera_of_Death,2005-08-07T07:21Z,"This comes from the official forum.

""There is no official english release date, and SSE has not announced an english publisher at this time. Don't worry, SSE has repeatedly announced that talks are underway with English publishers, and that all they are doing now is finding the best one to help bring their game to English audiences. It is definitely going to be released for the English market, all we can do now is wait for official news. 

The latest timeframe is 2005, but that is unconfirmed.""

And they also delays it because off all the bugs in the other versions.. They whant to give us a great problem free game.. And that I like :)

But I realy hope it comes before the ending of this year...."
,wedajm,2006-03-20T00:32Z,"En engelsk version kommer ut under detta år, 2006"
,conslerb,2007-01-11T04:48Z,"I know it's a bit late, but if anyone has the data for this torrent and can seed a bit, it would be greatly appreciated.  Between the 4 peers currently connected, we have 99.9% of the torrent.  Just missing that one tiny piece. :P

For those who don't know, there's a patch for the german version of the game that translates all the text to english.  Since I live in the US and probably will never find The Fall anyone I can buy it, I'm gonna try this with the spanish version, as I can't find any other torrent anywhere for this game."
,Mandrilo,2007-01-17T10:27Z,"Please, can someone seed i miss just 1mb.
thx"
,Mandrilo,2007-01-17T22:41Z,anyone? cmon guys i ll buy u a beer!!!
,tehtechman,2007-02-15T21:23Z,Still stuck at 99.9% there are 10 peers.  BTW I _had_ a copy of the German version.  If I can find it again I'll try to upload it.
,johanp81,2007-03-14T22:37Z,"Please seed, stuck at 99.92"
,johanp81,2007-03-14T22:38Z,Yeah could anyone upload the german version pls:)
,MBlakley,2007-04-24T20:06Z,"Seeders = Awesome
