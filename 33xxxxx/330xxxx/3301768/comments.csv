,Eagles,2005-03-14T22:22Z,"Unfortunetely there is text at the top (PROPERTY) and the bottum(DO NOT DUPLICATE) but youÂ´ll hardly notice it, because it isnÂ´t white, but light grey
Sorry ;-)"

,KungPow,2005-03-27T10:06Z,"i got no sound on the movie when i burned it, i used magic iso.  does the sound realy work on this film ? this is my first movie that i didnt get any sound on.."
,mikek,2005-07-07T04:23Z,"ok if there is a problem with sound, here is the answer, saying you aree watching it on a computer. Theres a codec called klite codec
search google. Download it and install it. i have so many media playersbut this one works on 99% of the shit thats out there. hope this helps "
,sonic_fan1,2007-02-25T22:06Z,"Just wondering...
Does someone out there someplace have the regular DVD release of this, or all the copies of this out there DVD Screeners?
I can live with the text on the top and bottom of the picture, but I'd much rather have a copy of the DVD release like you'd get at a store."
