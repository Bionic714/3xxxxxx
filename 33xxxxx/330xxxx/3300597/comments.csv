3.6/10   
Another spoof of the Scream/I Know What You Did Last Summer horror gene involving a group of popular high school students stalked by a bumbling masked killer while a dogged reporter named Hagitha Utslay covers the story and of the plight of the prime suspect and transfer student Dawson. 
It's your typical high school where a group of friends including Dawson (Harley), Slab (Rex) and Boner (Strong) are enjoying school life. Until, as serial killer turns up and starts chasing after them one by one. Noone knows who this killer is, as he obviously slips around the school. Will they finally unmask the killer before it's too late? "
