,elf,2005-03-29T01:58Z,"Ni som använder Mac, vilken program använder ni för att hämta filerna? Till PC finns det en uppsjö, men vad kör ni till Mac?"
,CubaLibre,2005-03-29T12:05Z,"Jag använder BitTorrent just nu, men azureus eller vad det heter ska tydligen vara bra."
,McPidi,2005-03-30T21:33Z,Noen som har serial til denne release?
,IngoX,2005-03-31T01:21Z,"elf: Jag använder Azureus och är nöjd med det. Fixar enkelt strul med teckenkodning så man slipper fula % ^ osv. Men torrent-filer på PB med åäö kan man inte hämta med Safari, enda gången jag ""switchar"" över till explorer (som å andra sidan gärna klipper av fil-namnet)."
,Ludor,2005-03-31T02:32Z,"IngoX: Konstigt, jag har inte haft några såna problem.

Azureus har alltid varit sjukt segt för mig. BitTorrent 3.4.2 är litet och smidigt. Man saknar details, dock.

Otroligt king att TPB har en Mac-avdelning, jag är fortfarande fascinerad."

,mac_davis,2007-03-27T19:24Z,"Livetype and Sountrack work for me (didn't expect they would even install), however FCE does not. It also states that AGP graphics card is needed. No body can help?"
,mac_davis,2007-03-27T20:55Z,"Livetype does not export, and only renders in wireframe, it also just generally doesn't work so well.

By the way, http://meatspin.com is a ""shocker site"" with a small movie of a girl with a penis that is spinning around while she.. uh, he? They. Are getting fucked in the ass. So. Unless you go for that sort of thing, or like to have interesting and *loud* surprises in your cubical, don't click on it thinking it is a crack."
,mac_davis,2007-03-27T21:56Z,"If you get a configuration error for not having AGP graphics just right click on Final Cut, Show Package Contents> Contents > Info.plist

Open Info.plist in TextEdit and change AGP to PCI

It works perfectly after a quick restart of the computer :) Good luck!"

,knvb1123,2007-05-12T00:03Z,"For the AGP card problem, it's like trying to run Call of Duty 3 on a 5 year old computer. It just won't run because the hardware doesn't have the capabilities. That's the same with Final Cut Express HD. It's a big program, and a powerful one too and you will need a non-AGP card to run it smoothly."

I'm new to the world of macs and I need help.

I just downloaded this, so thanks for seeding.

When I run it, it says I need an AGP graphics card.

There is an explanation earlier in these comments of how to get round this, but sadly I dont really understand it (said I was stupid) and cant it to work.

I have a new iMac with Leopard installed. IS there any chance fo getting this to work or not?

Thanks in advance.
