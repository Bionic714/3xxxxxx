(sorry till er som försökte ladda förut!..... Första gången jag laddar upp en torrent & något gick tydligen snett!)

Released May 2003 on Twisted Records. Written and produced by OTT. Fans of early Banco-de-Gaia will no doubt find comfort in the spaced out global dub-fest that is 'Blumenkraft'; atmospheric and spacey mixes with funky delicious grooves and, in places, upbeat danceable beats. This is more than dub!

With a wealth of production and recording experience under his belt, including Sinead O’Connor, The Orb and Brian Eno, OTT turned his editing skills to Sphongle with Simon Posford (aka Hallucinogen). OTT then produced a remix album of Hallucinogens tracks titled 'Hallucinogen in Dub', which was followed by his debut album 'Blumenkraft' on Twisted Records in 2003.
