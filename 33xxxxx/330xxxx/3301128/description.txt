Alright here is another one i filmed, this time its Millencolin on there first UK tour. I travelled 4 hours to see them and No Fun At All and it was well worth it. Both bands were great with No Fun At All headlining, and i will post them next. This shows Millencolin at there best before silly moustaches and festivals, a small club and a small enthusiastic crowd. So i hope you enjoy this one as much as i did filming it.

Millencolin-D.O.Y. Leeds England 11th December 1995 SVCD 41m Minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.         http://www.videolan.org/
