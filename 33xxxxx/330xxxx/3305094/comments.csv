,iBookG4G,2007-08-14T10:56Z,"Why isnt the game working properly, maybe you can help or someone can give some instructions hotwto installit on mac.?"
,iBookG4G,2007-08-14T10:57Z,"and why do I get this error ""mounting failed, invalid checksum"" ????? is it a fake, maybe thats why it wont install it on my mac."
,ripley2020,2008-07-22T10:39Z,"Hi iBookG4G
I can't answer about the checksum business. I got the same thing on a powerbook G4 when using Disk Utility. The solution I found was to burn with Toast without mounting. After burning I  copied the crack version to the same folder and added a 1 at the end of the file name. It all runs fine. Thanks queche!"
,ripley2020,2008-07-22T10:46Z,"Hi boys and girls

,shuriken1994,2009-04-13T16:09Z,I started splinter cell but by sensors on my laptop keyboard is broken so i have to use a keyboard attached to my computer(MAC). But i cant walk around IN SPLINTER CELL.. Is it because i got an attached keyboard? Or is it something else?
,shuriken1994,2009-04-13T16:15Z,"If u cant get the splinter vell to work. you have to press....I dont know what it is in english. but in norwegian it is ""hopp over"" butten when you are going to start the dmg. Instead of waiting till its done. When you open it you have to put the crack in the splinter cell mapp.(you have to make that mapp) and you have to putt the rest of the files  in with it too. And to putt the crack inside you have to change the name of the splinter cell(non crack). after that you can put the crack inside the mapp with the rest of the things. And i have a MAC OS X INTEL. Leopard. versjon: 10.5.6 Sayonara!. "
,Gambit3534,2009-06-13T20:09Z,I just cant seem to get how to do any of this. i have the dmg downloaded can anyone explain it step by step from there?
,imnoobish,2009-10-08T05:43Z,is the game in english?
,proxima3003,2009-11-07T18:05Z,"Yes, the game is english...

Here is what worked for me. (Mac OS 10.6 Snow Leopard)
1. Launch the Splinter Cell dmg. Click ""Skip"" when the disk utility starts verifying the image, otherwise you'll get the ""checksum"" error.
2. Copy the Splinter Cell folder onto your hard drive (Apps or any other)
3. Replace the Splinter Cell app file (Sam Fishers face on the icon) with the cracked one, then launch the game. "
,Schutt12,2009-11-22T04:35Z,I need someone.... anyone to seed... please just one kind person.... 11-20-09
