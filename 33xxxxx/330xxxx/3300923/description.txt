Rare South African hard rock from the early '70s similar to Leafhound (and therefore Led Zep). Sledgehammer guitar work, soaring vocals and a real rock n' roll attitude put this in the top 10 obscurities of the genre. Excellent cover versions of 'Into the Fire' Deep Purple, 'War Pigs' Sabbath and an extended 10 minute version of 'Season of the Witch' which is mind frying.The band are legends in South Africa.
