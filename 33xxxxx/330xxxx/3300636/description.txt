Once again we are pleased to demonstrate the continued and unflinching support of our bios releases with the completion of X3 Config Live Bios Build 3029.

There are many many fixes and improvements in this release including a completely overhauled ftp and http system giving a sustained average speed of at least 10mb/s in all our bench tests. As you can see from the changelog there are many improvements to the skinning system and also various fixes and changes as requested by our users.

The X3 bios is the most powerful available in the scene today and we will further reiterate that fact with the release of X2 Config Live in the next week or so.
