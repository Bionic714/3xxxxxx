These tracks are a variety of d/loaded tracks. 
If you like Nick Drake try a couple.

The box set 'Fruit Tree' is kicking about somewhere, when I dig it out....

If you've got some Nick Drake that isn't on 'Fruit Tree' get it out there!!

A singular talent who passed almost unnoticed during his brief lifetime, Nick Drake produced several albums of chilling, somber beauty. With hindsight, these have come to be recognized as peak achievements of both the British folk-rock scene and the entire rock singer/songwriter genre.
