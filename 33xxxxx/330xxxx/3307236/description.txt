“Formed in Naples in late 60's, with the initial name of Battitori Selvaggi, playing in Nato bases in Italy. 

Second album released in 1972 on Polydor, Ys (from the name of a legendary town in Brittany), is a masterpiece, giving the group the success they deserved. Inexplicably an english-sung version, ready to release, was never issued.”-IP

Actually, only some of the tracks are re-recorded in English. The English version was issued by Mellow Records in Italy as sort of a mini-album but they have never responded to my queries.

This is a great album with classical and rock influences, some excellent electronic sounds and dynamic vocals. 

There is a bonus single A-Side from 1973 included and I have included front covers of the official and Mexican bootleg singles.
Enjoy!
