,SuperSatan3,2009-12-21T20:19Z,"I've noticed a lot of albums now are in .FLAC format. Is there a player for this besides VLC, or is there a way to convert them into something itunes would play?"
,brettonknight,2010-08-24T00:58Z,I use foobar for my flac files. foobar has the advantage of coming with an audio converter that allows you to convert flac to any other codec assuming you have it on your computer. once youve changed it from flac you can use whatever player.
,MwMike,2010-08-26T12:07Z,"You might as well stick with Foobar anyways, even if as it is it's not too aesthetically pleasing to start with, it's comparatively customisable and for performance and such it completely trumps iTunes."
,tight384,2010-11-11T21:34Z,"For .flac, I quite like Mediamonkey as well. "
,MOVNGFWD,2011-02-24T01:51Z,"...on my Mac, I use XLD to convert them into iTunes... works to split cue files as well, and automatically adds it to a designated playlist in iTunes..."
