,Rousk,2005-03-27T00:10Z,"Är det någon som har hela och kan gå ut och seeda?

enl. bittorrent så finns inte hela utdelat."
,Rousk,2005-03-27T11:48Z,"Ok, sorry

Enl. mitt bittorrent så finns det inga hela versioner ute, och jag är fast på 80,5%

Bra arbete med att samla och rippa alla btw, kul att se en så stor samling ^^"
,Slowstarter,2005-03-30T21:14Z,Det är väl rippat från CD och inte från LP? Eller?
,cabe,2005-03-31T09:27Z,Från CD ja.
,fetman,2005-03-31T20:40Z,"är det alla beatles skivor då? står bara ""blandat bla bla"" i rubriken"
,Gollum,2005-04-04T22:44Z,Blandat Beatlesmaterial står det
,Slabbe,2005-04-18T18:43Z,"Det är en sån här torrent som gör en glad hela veckan lång!

,Casperius,2005-07-30T22:46Z,"Man kan ju diskutera samlingen hurvida den är komplett eller inte. Alla officiella album är ju med men dock inte ""Real Love"" singeln som borde vara med om ""Free as a bird"" singeln är med...  Men det är annars en fin samling!  =)"

,Loughtus,2006-05-18T21:11Z,"Har laddat en stund och det går stabilt, filerna verkar vara vettigt taggade också, ett plus! 

Väljer dock att inte ladda ner alla album eftersom jag redan har några och att det ju ingår flera samlingsalbum här, så det blir ju samma låtar flera gånger då."
,ziggy669,2006-05-19T08:42Z,"Fantastic torrent, thanks a lot.

,zangetsubankai,2006-08-28T15:34Z,"the 38.100.0.0 subnet has a a lot of peers on this torrent with sequential IP addresses. Most likely they are trying to poison it, so you would do well to block these IP addresses in your client. "

,Xiiime,2009-07-23T22:20Z,"Hi, thank you for this wonderful torrent.
I always keep all my downloaded torrents in seeding, I never never delete it.
So, if the torrents I have ain't seeded, it's because I've turned my computer off or I'm on holiday."
,Xiiime,2009-07-24T10:43Z,"So, my download is over, you can download this torrent it is seeded by me at least. 
(though i won't seed from 26th to 7th august)
I've verified and until now everything is good.

Thank you for this torrent"
,Xiiime,2009-07-24T10:45Z,"Skoolz: I think you had a break of your connection or electricity. Right click on your torrent and click on ""Force Verifying"", it would work for a time and after it will take your download normally from 95%"
