Shinji Ikari, a 14-year-old child of the new Earth, is summoned by his long-estranged father Gendo to an underground city underneath Tokyo-3, where the United Nations research organization known as NERV is stationed. To match the fearsome power of the Angels, NERV has constructed a biomechanical weapon named 'Evangelion' - a terrifying monster that young Shinji is destined to pilot.
