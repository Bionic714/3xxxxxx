******************************************
In Thief: Deadly Shadows, gamers once again take on the role of Garrett, a master thief. Garrett is rarely seen, never caught and capable of breaking into the most ingeniously secured places. Garrett steals from the wealthy and gives to himself, making his living in the dark and foreboding City. Preferring to be left alone to ply his trade, prophecies of an impending Dark Age dictate a different plan for the thief. In Garrett?s efforts to prevent this approaching Dark Age, he has inadvertently roused an ancient hidden evil. Without allies, Garrett finds himself standing alone between the City and the forces that would crush it.

You play Garrett, the master thief. Rarely seen and never caught, Garrett is the best that ever was. Able to sneak past any guard, pick any lock, and break into the most ingeniously secured residences, Garrett steals from the wealthy and gives to himself, making his living in the dark and foreboding City. World weary and cynical, Garrett wants nothing more than to be left alone to ply his trade. But things never work out that way.

,Pejo18,2007-12-01T07:09Z,Ok. I solved a problem with triler. This is happening with core 2 duo processors. Only what you need to do is: When you start a game you need to minimize and start task managers (Ctrl+Alt+Del) and enter in prosses tab and Find T3.exe   and  T3main.exe and press on each right click and Set Affinity and uncheck one field and press ok. That's it.

,AartSnikkelbaard,2008-03-25T20:02Z,"Found something what 'solved' the DEP issue in Vista:

""To stop the DEP protection, launch an elevated command prompt shell with administrative priviledges and credentials (log on to Windows Vista with a user account with administrator rights, and then right click on Command Prompt icon and select ?Run as Administrator, or turn off UAC). Then execute the following command:

bcdedit.exe /set {current} nx AlwaysOff

If you regret your decision and now wants to enable or turn back on the DEP protection for your Windows Vista, simply use the following command instead:

bcdedit.exe /set {current} nx AlwaysOn"""
,Meeps,2008-03-29T11:34Z,This torrent wont work...
,angelo.dubas,2008-05-07T16:57Z,"This Torrent WON'T WORK

Dont download it."
,hybridmoments82,2008-06-28T18:55Z,"I use Vista, and this game did not work when I first installed it, however I looked into all of the issues this game has with vista and rest assured, it is NOT the torrent. Here are all of the problems I researched and how to fix it to make this very torrent work with Vista:

First and foremost, the crack in this torrent DOES NOT WORK!  DO NOT USE IT!  Instead, download the unprotected exe onthis page.  It's the VERY FIRST link under the category ""Game Fixes"". 

If that doesn't work, you may be getting a DEP (Data Execution Prevention) error message.  If this is the case, simply click Start, and in the ""Start Search"" box, type ""sysdm.cpl"" (without quotes).  You'll get vista's vastly obnoxious ""Windows needs your permission to continue"" window. Click Continue, then click the Advanced tab, then click ""Settings..."" under Performance, click on the radio button that states ""Turn on DEP for all programs and services except those I select:"", click ""Add..."", and find your newly UNprotected copy of Thief3 aptly called ""t3.exe"". 

If that doesn't work, you may have a compatibility issue.  This one is easy: simply right-click t3.exe in it's install directory, click Properties, click Compatibility, and click the check box stating ""Run this program in compatibility mode for:"", select from the drop-down menu ""Windows XP (Service Pack 2)"".

If even THAT doesn't work, sometimes Thief 3 has DirectX issues.  You can solve this by installing DirectX 9c directly from Microsoft (this requires an ActiveX control Microsoft will install to see if your copy of Vista is genuine, so be careful you dirty pirates you!).  If you are indeed a dirty pirate with an rather UN-genuine version of Vista, you can download the cab files for DirectX 9c here but I warn you, there is NO INSTALLATION WIZARD!!! You will need to copy these cab files manually to your system32 directory. 

DON'T WORRY!! YOU WILL STILL HAVE DIRECTX 10!  DIRECTX DOES NOT COPY OVER ITSELF!!  INSTALLING DIRECTX 9 WILL SIMPLY ADD MISSING FILES DIRECTX 10 DOES NOT HAVE!!!  YOU CAN HAVE BOTH AT THE SAME TIME WITHOUT A PROBLEM!!!

If that doesn't work, pick up a book on how to use your computer, because this is as far as I go.  But I PROMISE YOU!!!  To protect RAZOR1911's rep, this torrent is 100% WORKING AND OPERABLE!!!  IT'S THE GAME THAT HAPPENS TO BE A LITTLE FAULTY!!

Happy Leeching you n00bs,


HybridMoments82"
,hybridmoments82,2008-06-28T19:04Z,"THIS COPY OF THIEF WORKS!!! WITHOUT A DOUBT!!!  Unless ofcourse you have no clue how to use the machine sitting in front of you, in which case, I'd recommend Vista for Dummies.

Here are the links in conjunction with my previous post as I noticed href-ing isnt allowed on pirate bay:

,mpilting,2009-01-07T01:35Z,"Yes, it works. I'm running vista and had to completely disable data execution prevention to get it work. Other than that, this game appears to be just about the buggiest piece of crap programming ever compiled (not the fault of razor1911 - blame Eidos or whoever the hell coded it)."
,mpilting,2009-01-07T02:00Z,"And for those of you who can't get past the demo movie after the game starts up (yes, I have this problem too): Hold down the esc key and maneuver the pointer around the screen until you've highlighted the menu selection you want, then click on it, releasing the esc key at about the same time. This maneuver has to be timed just right or it won't work. Good luck! You're gonna need it!"

,theRealKarmine,2009-08-09T03:49Z,i downloaded this torrent 3 years ago and i still have the original cd's i burned it to....so those of you who say it doesnt work you are full of shit.  go fuck yourself.
,Rethic,2009-09-19T20:54Z,"I can officially confirm that the CRACK on CD3, DOES NOT WORK. Instead go to gamecopyworld.com and search for: ''Thief Deadly Shadows'' and choose this file: 

Thief 3 v1.0.0.1 [ALL] No-CD/Original EXE

This crack is confirmed to work on Windows Vista Premium, with dual core and DirectX 10.

I cannot give any Kudos to Platus for re-releasing Razor's torrent. Since it is highly doubtful that Razor would add a faulty crack to one of his own torrents, Platus is to blame for the faulty crack in this torrent."

,Bai-Long,2011-01-17T13:48Z,"wow i have never had a game fuck me over this bad not only did i need the Thief 3 v1.0.0.1 [ALL] No-CD/Original EXE but i can't get past the demo movie, yes i did the esc key trick and as soon as i click new game it freezes on me :( i think i need the 1.2 nocd but i cant find it anywhere."
,Bai-Long,2011-01-18T01:54Z,"ok i found a fix! the game does not like  most dual core cpu like AMD Athlon 64 X2 or an Intel Pentium ""D"" so the fix is to set Thief III to use only one core. This can be accomplished by entering the Processes tab of the Task Manager when the game is running, right clicking each of the Thief III-releated processes (T3Main.exe, T3.exe), selecting ""Affinity"" and unchecking one of the CPUs. ps you have to do this every time you start the game."

,Upsetting,2011-07-22T02:14Z,"I am very confused. After downloading, all I have is a bunch on rar files and other random files. How in the hell am I supposed to mount this?"
,Upsetting,2011-07-22T02:49Z,"Since the files are not ISO I converted with no affect. How are others able to install it? The torrent I downloaded had a bunch of rar files and other junk. The read me says to unzip then mount, I tried mounting the 20+ files but nothing happened. Help!!???"
,Upsetting,2011-07-22T21:12Z,Never mind I figured it out.
,than0salimosss,2012-02-25T13:22Z,should i burn only the bin/cue files or the part one too?
,CravinhoSantos,2012-07-15T03:59Z,Can someone tell me why sometimes I start my game and click on Load some previously saved game and Thief freezes?? ._.
