GAME NOTES:
  ~~~~~~~~~~    
  You are Garrett, the master thief. Rarely seen and never caught, Garrett is
  the best that ever was. Able to sneak past any guard, pick any lock, and
  break into the most ingeniously secured residences. Garrett steals from the
  wealthy and gives to himself, making his living in the dark and foreboding
  City. Here crime and corruption are commonplace, wealthy nobles prey on the
  poor and each other, and magic and machinery coexist uneasily. World weary
  and cynical, Garrett wants nothing more than to be left alone to ply his
  trade. But things never work out that way. 
  
  According to ancient prophecies, a Dark Age is approaching. He's determined
  to stop this darkness before it comes, before someone loses an eye...or
  worse. 
  
  Garrett begins a cautious collaboration with the Keepers, an enigmatic and
  secretive group. They supply prophetic Glyphs he needs to avert the
  approaching doom, and he supplies the raw nerve, caustic wit, and artistic
  thievery that they lack. He sneaks his way through castles, mansions,
  prisons, cathedrals, dungeons, and museums, past armed guards, hired muscle,
  angry thugs, hideous monsters, and much worse. He's out to steal the
  City's oldest treasures - treasures that can help stop the darkness
  foretold in the prophecies.
  
  But things quickly go awry. Disaster looms closer with every step Garrett
  takes. In his efforts to prevent the Dark Age, he has inadvertently roused
  an ancient hidden evil. To make matters worse, the Keepers, sworn to protect
  the City and maintain the balance, instead find themselves decaying from
  their very core. In their desperate search for the One who will betray them,
  their eyes turn to Garrett. 
  
  Once again, Garrett finds himself without allies, standing alone between the
  City and the forces that would crush it. Will his skills be enough to save
  the dying City? Can he survive betrayal, assassins, and war in the
  labyrinthine city streets? Will he destroy or be destroyed by the evil he
  awoke? And finally, what must he do to get what he wants most of all: to be
  left alone plying his trade as the City's greatest... Thief?
