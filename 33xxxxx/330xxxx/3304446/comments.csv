Thanks for this one!"
,pumperz,2009-12-31T03:44Z,"dream cast - the best of all the casts from around the world (in the opinion of the producers of teh reunion not me)- leads are played by the US and UK leads by and large, the end has a song where the Jean-Val Jeans from around the world participate - lea salonga is amazing as eponine. there is a video too HTH"
,White_King,2011-01-12T21:27Z,"Or, In Javert's case, the guy who played him in Australia.  I think I agree with the producers; Colm Wilkinson is truly fantastic."
,AXPspicoli,2011-03-09T04:41Z,Colm Wilkinson is the SHIT! Thanks for this. My copy was deleted on accident when I purged files from my computer
