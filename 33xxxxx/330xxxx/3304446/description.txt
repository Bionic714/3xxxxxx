After having this on the stereo non stop for the best part of the last 8 months, finally managed to stop listening to it for a while..!

If they get better than this then lets hear it.

Encoded VBR highest rate by Nero from original CD.

Have also got 
Les Miserables - The Dream Cast in Concert (1998) DVD, converted to mp4 by Nero Recorde 2. If anyone would like that posting also then please add comment to effect.

Dont forget ... you need to seed.
