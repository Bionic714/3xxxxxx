With its integrated Web browser, HiTune makes playing and searching for streams easy, but the product needs to mature before we can recommend it.

When you launch HiTune, you can use the app's search tool to look for MP3- streaming stations or use the integrated Web browser to surf your favorite sites. From there, you can simply play a station or play and record one at the same time. Like iRadio, this application will save your files as MP3s as they are streamed, and it doesn't give you control over quality. HiTune can also record from RealPlayer or Windows Media Player.

The program's interface looks like a work in progress. (On the Browse screen, for example, there are five identical unlabeled buttons that bring you to different browsing areas.) The documentation is also poor, written in broken English with plenty of errors, and there are no scheduling options. HiTune shows inspiration in how it lets people search for music, but it's not yet ready for the masses."
