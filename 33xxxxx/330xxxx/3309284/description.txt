The animated comedy tells the story of a lowly wood pigeon
named Valiant, who overcomes his small size to become a
hero in Great Britain's Royal Air Force Homing Pigeon Service
during World War II. The RHPS advanced the Allied cause by
flying vital messages about enemy movements across the
English Channel, whilst evading brutal attacks by the enemy's
Falcon Brigade.</font>

<font size="1"><u>Notes</u>:
Video is so dark that you´d think the whole movie takes place at night
Sound is good, a bit hollow maybe
One of the first releases of this movie, only one i could find so i share to you.</font>
