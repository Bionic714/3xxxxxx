R.I.P Mitch Hedberg 
29/03/05"
,g_clipp,2006-03-28T07:15Z,"man, i first saw him doing standup on CC one friday nite.. it was H+ILAROIUS@  he was sooo drunk....  i never knew he passed... very sad.. .very sad.......... LAY DOWN THE HERION PEOPLE "
,AWu-TangLife,2008-06-08T19:50Z,"Tripgnosis, you are an ignorant excuse for a piece of bitch ass fag bait.

Don't open your cock hole just to let your bullshit spill out, about someone whom you obviously don't know a fucking thing about.

Just because Mitch doesn't spout such homoerotic phrases such as ""Git'r'dun"" (witch I am sure you just can't get enough), doesn't make his career ""dumb luck"".

As to why your faggot bitch ass thinks that it is not the fan's place to morn someone who made a HUGE impact in their lives through their ART, or they simply do not have a right to, that is just the semen depraved elaborations of a legal mental defective/Ricky Martin enthusiast .

I would like to kick your stupid worthless fucking whore of a mother in her windpipe, just for bringing a piece of shit such as yourself into a world that was fortunate enough to have been graced with the presence of Mitch Hedberg.

Rest In Peace."
,panthers09,2008-08-16T09:40Z,"Tripgnosis.... why are you such a douche bag?

All those people giving Mitch ""RIP""s and things like that are just supporting him. Why does it matter if we didn't know him personally or not. Mitch was an amazing fucking guy and just because he did some drugs, that doesn't ruin it. I'm sorry if it would offend you if people were saying they missed him more than you. You are a dumbass for thinking that and saying it. And on top of that, Heath Ledger didn't commit suicide or purposefully overdose. He was playing a deranged character in a movie and he got so much into the role that he started to get a little messed up to. The meds he was on were to not make him so depressed and he accidently took more than he should have. Again you are a douche bag and if people want to tell a ""Stranger"" as u said it, to RIP, then who cares. Plus, I don't see why you can't miss someone you never actually met. I never met Mitch in my life but I fucking miss him because he was an awesome guy, and he was funny as hell, and I would've loved to see him live and to see how far he would have gone. Once more, you are a douche bag and need to not get offended because people like Mitch, Kurt, and Heath better than you."
,RakaDisciple,2008-09-04T16:06Z,"As a matter of fact asshole i did know mitch, and lynn his girlfriend. we used to email eachother. mitch liked to party ok but he wasnt just sum lucky heroine addict. YOU are the one who doesnt know shit about them so u just shut yer fuckin mouth. He was a really cool guy and i miss him alot.
Now to all the real supporters and fans of mitch i just wanted to let u know that sept. 9th 2008 he actually has a new cd. its the material he was working on in the last few months before he passed. you can find out more at mitchhedberg.net. its 40 minutes of previously unreleased standup. "
,RakaDisciple,2008-09-04T16:16Z,"sry i should specify that im talkin about tripgnosis. i agree with the majority of what panther said. And i can also tell you all that mitch would NOT want you to shoot up for him. His death should be a lesson to anyone who thinks that the drugs wont catch up with them. I havent done ANY drugs since his death and im glad that im done with that. Please people, dont think he would want you to use drugs or alcohol."
,bitchesbrew,2009-02-27T06:49Z,"The sad thing is, heroin probably defined who he was to some extent. Without such drugs would we of had the rolling stones or zeppelin or Chris Farley? Drugs only become bad when people die from them."
,Tripgnosis,2009-09-25T02:16Z,"wow. I guess the moderators thought my comments to be inflammatory. Sorry about that guys....
All I was tryin to say is that I think it's sad that our culture idolizes people who bring about their ownn demise and consider that demise tragic. It's tragic when a child is killed by a drunk driver. A guy who shoots too heroin in his vein is foolish, not tragic. He was a great comedian. One of my favourites to be sure. But he know more deserves the mourning of strangers than me or you or the next guy. He was a comedian and made us laugh, he didn't bring about some profound and lasting positive change. 

To those who DID know him (Raka) it is obvously right and proper that you should mourn him. And I'm sure you do miss him. But as a friend, don't you think that the grieving of some random stranger who didn't even know him trivializes your own?

And yeah, I know these comments are a bit late, I just happened to have to re-download this and saw what ruckus I caused.....

Again, my apologies to the mods if you thought I was trollin...."
,kabalizo,2009-10-04T20:42Z,"comedy is hard, but funny."
,MANiK916,2009-12-25T18:23Z,The best that ever did it!
,SinWindow,2010-01-12T06:36Z,"@ Tirpgnosis: you're a bitch-made little cock sucking faggot. Look at you trying to crawl back and apologize when everyone clearly hates you regardless of what you try to say. 

 Oh really, so you think that strangers mourning someone is disrespectful? Or that you shouldn't grieve someones death just because you didn't know them personally? Where the fuck are you from, you dickless piece of shit.  

And quit trying to suck the MODs dick, 'oh I'm sorry guys i didn't want to offend anyone.'  You cowardly little fuck, eat shit and die a slow painful death while your mom is raped in front of you.

RIP Mitch Hedberg"
,jarly,2010-02-18T13:53Z,"When I die, I want people to flame each other on message boards and tracker comments.  Thanks for the up, elbastardo."
,earnhardtfanthreee,2010-07-08T18:58Z,"Tripgnosis, It\'s all good....don\'t let the haters misunderstand you. I\'m sure you didn\'t mean anything derogatory. Apology accepted....seed on bro."
,mikeu5717,2010-12-09T11:18Z,"i laugh at ppl that get into this kinda shit on the internet haha, fucking idiots. "
,stormy1,2011-01-02T03:49Z,"Laugh, don't bitch and gripe, life is too short. Thanks for the upload"
,FRivera,2012-01-09T13:40Z,"Tripgnosis feels like you're saying glaringly naive things just to get responses. If a ""complete stranger"" makes your life brighter even for a hour, and he can cheer you up and make you laugh, that's more than a ""complete stranger"", isnt it? OF COURSE I'll mourn for a guy who entertained me more than for you, a guy whose shining achievement is trying to convince people on the Web that their fave entertainers dont deserve their mourning and pity."

,tiz2,2012-07-14T13:22Z,"@ Tripgnosis: You have a sad view of the world lacking in nuance. Several of my favourite comedians (eg. David Cross, Patton Oswalt) suffer from depression. Should that lead to death trough drugs or suicide, that would be very sad indeed. But there can be many good reasons for mourning a stranger, the way they lived, the way they died, or if you hear just one thing about them that touches you in some way. And if you were to ask one of their relatives I hardly believe they would find that to ""trivialize their grief"", I believe they would find that both moving and comforting. "
