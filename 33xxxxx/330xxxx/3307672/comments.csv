The TimeBox application is a powerful, easy-to-use time management tool. It allows contractors and consulting professionals to keep track of their time spent on various projects and tasks, and to cross-reference projects and tasks in a variety of reports and summaries. It currently runs on Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP and Mac OSX, as well as any other platform with a Java RunTime Environment (including Solaris and Linux.)

The TimeBox application is an important part of the TimeSuite time tracking system, a system that allows workgroups and project teams to collectively track their time. Individual workers track their time on their TimeBox instances. They periodically submit their time to a single instance ClokBox, which is a server-based application. The ClokBox application can then track and report on the collective times of all team members.

TimeBox is a favorite time tracking application, used by organizations as small as one or two individuals, and as large as EDS and Sun Microsystems."
