,mctommy,2006-07-04T23:57Z,"Quite poor :( the nfo file goes on and on and on about how brilliant this release is compared to that of other groups, and what the correct way to rip is, and how other groups do it wrong etc etc etc.  To the ripper - have you even watched this?!  There is a pause of a few identical frames every second!!! This happens once a second throughout the _whole_ movie causing less than smooth playback.

Tested on a few dvd players.

Do not bother with this one unless u can put up with the jitters once a second!

Gonna try another groups release, as this is just not easy to watch"
