men good job anyway ;)"
,AnticZ,2005-03-18T18:53Z,silent hunter 3 is starforce 3 protected wich means you wont see a release. And its a shame that it is cus i do not buy starforce games. Starforce is like a damn virus in the way it installs itself in your comp registry etc.
,Blitz86,2005-03-18T19:05Z,"Yeah silent hunter 3 looks good, ser fett ut :D"
,leveller,2005-03-18T19:17Z,Detta spel patchat kan man ju spela emot DestroyerCommand patchat via lan eller tcp/ip. Riktigt kul för den inbitne subsimmaren.
,BoredJedi,2005-03-19T07:55Z,"There are already complaints about SH3 and the starforce copy protection. I wouldn't call it a virus since there is a utility out there to remove it (not a starforce utility).  I'd call it more Crippleware for the legit purchaser of a game. 

Have a read of an interview

we constantly monitor the crack sites and when a game is cracked we study it and modify our code if needed, small fixes are often done weekly and major fixes perhaps monthly. It depends on the circumstances.

Well, pessimism is a disease, and I´m afraid you have been infected. I can agree that Starforce 3 Proffessional is a damn good protection against piracy. But, the crackers are always one step ahead. Maybe it won´t be cracked in a proper way so you have to 1.unrar 2. mount with daemon 3. install 4. paste the .exe file in the game-diretory 5. enjoy!....... But life isn´t simpel, and it is the same with piracy. Maybe they release a CloneCD and you have to pull out some cables or install ""Starfuck"" (maybe u have heard about it). 

Finally... If you know Silent Hunter 3 won´t be released, then don´t bother commenting then. There are people with patient that doesn´t own a fortune who will wait a while for this. ""Don´t block the sun my friend"""
,AnticZ,2005-03-21T12:14Z,"krutan: you are mistaken.

Those were not cracked. You could bypass the starforce 3 protection if you had a special type of motherboard. Cus starforce checks the IO data etc on your motherboard for Devices. On Some you could just disable devices to get a game to work on some motherboards. but those bypasses got removed with the first patches released for those games. And did not work for newer games as the SF3 on those games were up to date.
Halflife 2 did not have starforce3 so you can not compare.
Gangland for example was never released in a working copy.
Beyond dinviity was never released as a working copy.
Soldiers was never released as a working copy.
The list goes on. 

Go to www.izonews.com and their forums yourself and tell them they are all pessimists if you want but that wont still get silent hunter 3 cracked and released :p However if you know some method of cracking SF3 then be our guest and inform us. Personaly i refuse to buy games with starforce3 due to the intrusive nature of the protection."

,AnticZ,2005-03-21T23:55Z,omfg Reloaded just released a cracked version :) they clearly rock. They expressed doubts that their version will be able to be patched though due to sf3 team blocking some loophole in next patch but still :P
