Btw. if there is a problem with the file conversion after the patch install, just run the FileConvert.exe manually."

,D.K.D.,2006-10-15T16:48Z,"Just follow the instructions given and the game will work perfectly. This worked for me, so don't listen to the morons claiming this torrent is corrupt.

Thanks a lot for this one... although I will get the ""real"", IRL version of the game in a week. :P"
,taifighter,2006-11-12T19:16Z,"Thanks very much for this!  I always wanted to try the Amazons expansion and never could get hold of it before it stopped being sold at stores.  Now that I know how cool it is, I'm buying it off eBay.  Much appreciated!

This download works perfectly - you just have to be very patient and work through what youre unfamiliar with.  The instructions could be a bit better but at least theyre a good start.  You WILL need that CD key, which still works.  

Download torrent, use WinRAR to extract the main RAR files.  Then use Daemon Tools to mount CD2, install full.  Follow instructions that come with this download for patch and crack updates.  Be sure to copy the CD key already listed in this thread into the instructions file so you always have it handy. 

Once everything is installed, unmount CD 2 in Daemon Tools and then mount the extracted MDS file for CD1, launch the game, enter the CD key when it asks for it, and you're all set!

If I can do it, and I am pretty much a clueless noob with this stuff, then so can you.  :)

Thanks again, X-Dream!"
,Deaththedark,2007-02-09T21:04Z,If anyone can help... What files do I extract? Do I just extract CD1.rar and CD2.rar? Cause I did that and I can't find the install button. I don't know what file to mount to daemon tools.. Any help if appreciated
,Deaththedark,2007-02-09T22:44Z,Eh... I fixed it.. Thanks for the help.

seeing you previoulsy noob post, how to extract or unzipp the items i can tell that u even are a noob.

So looking at your last post, i can see you are downloading some junk porn and fake releases, which have infected your system really bad. Im wondering why windows is still booting.

C:/windows/system32 
should work then"

,Kulde,2011-01-26T11:11Z,"ka_sick: Fuck you talking about, asshole? oO

As Munchkin said, there's 20+ RAR-files in the CD2-folder, all the exact same size and same filename - and he wants to know if he needs to unzip all the files, or if not, which one/s he needs to unzip. Junk porn and fake releases infected his system? You're a douchebag; if you want to be a cool big-mouthed tough guy then go outside and try doing it there, not on the internet.

Fucking wanker."
