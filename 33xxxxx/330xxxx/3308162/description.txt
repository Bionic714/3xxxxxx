Accompany Kao through the thickets of Beaver Forest to Ice Land, where you will crush ice with a catapult to climb to a mountaintop and slide down on a snowboard; you will take part in a speedboat race, plunge into blue ocean and then you will fly on a crazy Pelican across the azure realm, to land on Treasure Island.
