TBS has a commercial at the very start of their release
which we wouldn't really care about... no big fucking
deal but their source is NOT the DSR it was labeled as.

Check the screenshots which include the frame number
each were captured from.  As an added bonus you can
play along at home, all you need to download is their
sample, cut off the commercial at the start and
you're ready to go.

We did get their whole release, and we did see the blocky
scenes throughout as shown in our screenshots.

This isn't qualitative, this is the same as someone
releasing something as HDTV which obviously is not.
