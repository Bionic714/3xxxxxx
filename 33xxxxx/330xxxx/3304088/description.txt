<b>Conduct Zero | Korea 2002 | Comedy | Eng Sub</b>

Why study when you're the boss of your school? Well that's the attitude that young Joong-pil (Ryu Seung-bum) adopts as he shamelessly goes around taking money from fellow, younger students. As if that weren't bad enough he's tried many a money making scam, drinks more than he should, swears like there was no tomorrow and generally walks around being a bad guy. With his enormous reputation and the responsibility that comes with it - that is to keep face and show that he's no loser - Joong-pil finds it increasingly hard to keep up with his studies, more to the point he doesn't care to, but when a young female student named Min-hee (Im Eun-kyung) catches his eye he realises he needs to shape up. If he's to capture the heart of this pretty and respectful girl he must learn to act like a gentleman; study hard and try not to pester anyone - a task that seems far beyond his capabilities as a human being.
