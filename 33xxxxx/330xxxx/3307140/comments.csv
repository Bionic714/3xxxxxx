,PUCCA,2005-04-22T01:22Z,"This is only in english!!  There´s not a swedish copy of this. It´s not that hard to understand english, reading english is the easiest way, talking and writing english correctly is harder. Even if you dont understand one pertically word you can understand the meaning and the content of the centence.... thats my opinion. And you can always use a dictionary. 

Det går vel greit med engelsk versjon hva? tror det var tysk og spansk også, men uansett gidder jeg ikke å scanne alle de sidene for hvert språk."
