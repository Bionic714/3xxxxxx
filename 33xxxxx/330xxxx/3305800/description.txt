A really good compilation of the more hippyish and spacey heavyness than straightforward rock. The San Ul Lim tracks are a great bonus as they are not from the Love, Peace & Poetry Series. Sorry, no cover scans, but MP3s are  named including country and year as per cover notes. I have some more Magognip heavy comps with cover scans to seed if this one is liked. PLEASE leave me comments.
Thanks to Magognip for letting me seed.
