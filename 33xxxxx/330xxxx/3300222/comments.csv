,elbastardo,2005-03-10T23:56Z,"Main reason:
Separate shows have separate air-dates/release-dates - hense separate torrents!

The other reason that I created multiple torrents is that there are separate shows that need to be separate. Creating one torrent for all shows will not benefit the search system. This way users can pick one show and be happy whith that or select them all and be happy.

...and by separating them to a 1by1 state my upload doesn't choke.

Don't like it? Not happy? Don't DL!
