"Coming from the ashes of Festa Mobile this band from Bari (where their name comes from) and based in Rome chose a very different musical style, concentrating on an instrumental jazz-rock that was very popular in Italy during the mid/late 70's.

Both their albums, released by EMI in 1976 and 1978, show strong influences by the likes of Weather Report or Mahavishnu Orchestra, mixed with a mediterranean feel that's more evident in Trusciant [their second album-brainticket]. 

After the second album the group disbanded, and reformed for a short while as a trio in 1983-84 with a disco-inclined self produced single. Brothers Boccuzzi have not left the music, still playing as sessionmen."-IP


Keyboard dominated jazz prog, rather light-weight, which can often stray into a funk territory of its own kind (you can hear the seeds of their 80s disco single, I'm sure). The drummer and bassist are really skilled here and provide a tight, but mobile, backbone, I think, but I can imagine they were really overlooked due to the brothers on dual keyboards. Admittedly, I wasn't crazy about this album at first but it grew on me over time and I think it is well worth adding to a collection even if it isn't one of the frequent listens. 

Apparently the original vinyl is still rather common and cheap in Italy...?

Enjoy!
