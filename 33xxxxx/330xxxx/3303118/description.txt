Slapshot not only were easily the longest-lasting of all the original Boston hardcore bands, but they managed to stay musically relevant much longer than, say, Gang Green. 

Released in 1996, 16 Valve Hate is a fully aggro blast of old-school hardcore, so defiantly true to the style's roots that it sounds timeless instead of retro. 

Original drummer Mark McKay even returns to the lineup to complete the circa-1984 picture.  Songs like the barking ''I Want You Dead'' are standard-issue Slapshot, complete with Jack Kelly's familiar hoarse but surprisingly expressive vocals, but the standouts are the heartfelt and unexpectedly catchy title track and, somewhat surprisingly, a version of the Smiths'  ''Bigmouth Strikes Again'' that's not at all the usual hardcore mockery of some poncy British art-school band, but a complete transformation of Morrissey's original song into a brutal but shockingly apt hardcore beatdown.
 Seriously, who knew that a line like ''Now I know how Joan of Arc felt'' would sound so right in a hardcore context? 

That sort of thing is what made Slapshot more than just another hardcore band.
