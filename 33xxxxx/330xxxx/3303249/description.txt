Release Notes:

Beck gets down with his new album - featuring a full offering of
that 'junkyard-funk' sound we've come to know and love from the
creatively quirky musician. Once again, he wisely tipped The Dust
Brothers (notorious producers of classic albums including Beastie
Boy's Paul's Boutique and Beck's own Grammy award winning album--
Odelay) to produce this latest album entitled, Guero. The result
is a long-awaited return to his catchy hip-hop, slide-guitar
blues, and funk influenced sound, found in classic tracks like
"Loser" and "Where It's At."

A melded tracklist, "E-Pro" and "Que' Onda Guero" sound like
something you'd find off a Beastie Boys or Cypress Hill album.
Jack White makes an appearance playing bass on the song "Go It
Alone," and Beck unleashes a funky guitar synth on "Earthquake
Weather," reminiscent of the classic Isley Brother's hit song
"Who's That Lady?"

With this latest creation, Beck delivers yet another genre defying
collection of uniquely inspired songs.
