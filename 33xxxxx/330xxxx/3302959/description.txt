the 2002 album without stevie for obvious reasons the line up is GREG RIDLEY, BOBBY TENCH,JERRY SHIRLEY and DAVE 'BUCKET' COWELL (Bad company) I must admit i was a bit weary of this album but i think its great very underatted and of course it was GREG's swansong its a rocker and it has its ballads its a lovely testimate from the pie and well worth a listen. I gurantee you will be singing the songs to yourself. Enjoy!!!!
