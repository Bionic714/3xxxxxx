This originally appeared on BBC as part of a simulcast of the Cincinnati Pop Festival. Here it's called "Midsummer Rock" and the "hosts" are local sports announcers doing a play-by-play as  the Stooges rock the crowd. Has the famous scene where Iggy goes into the crowd and smears peanut butter all over himself.
