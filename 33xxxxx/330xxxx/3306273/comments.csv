The maps and graphics are cool and very convincing, but don't be fooled! Visit a few IP address/location test sites, and you will see that you are quite visible. Did Steganos not test their software before making these wild claims, or are they deliberately fleecing the gullible? All this program does is slow down your internet connection. IT DOES NOT MASK YOUR IP ADDRESS!
