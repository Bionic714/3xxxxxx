,rrubbinn,2006-04-04T09:14Z,Can you seed between 00:00AM - 09:00AM. I am at 74%. I must have this one
,Gratne,2006-05-09T22:00Z,how do the subtitle file work? 
,rrubbinn,2006-05-10T09:47Z,Ey Gratne use BSPlayer. It's a program that allows any kind of subtitles.
,rrubbinn,2006-05-10T09:53Z,"The sound is great.  Very very great movie.
zyxqwerty try to download K-Lite Codec because you must not have the right ones for the sound. Or maybe during your download has occurred an error"
,theSquiggly,2006-07-16T12:47Z,Nice... lookin' fwd to watchin' this =) thanks
,Animerocks313,2006-12-02T20:09Z,"Ok, I completed downloading this, and I will seed for a while, but I am having problems viewing the subtitles.  First of all, the subs are in a .sub format, which isn't as common as the .ssa format.  I have read the comments, and I got BSPlayer (really annoying with the ad thing, so I got an older version), and K-Lite Codecs.  When I open this in any other player besides MPC or BSPlayer, it just plays the sound very quickly with no subtitles (it seems like the whole file is corrupt).  But when I play it in BSPlayer, it plays fine with the exception that I cannot open up the subtitle file.  When I attempt to open it, it lets me, but BSPlayer continues to say ""No Subtitles.""  When I try to play it in MPC, I plays fine like in BS, but again, when I try to load the subtitle file, it errors.  This time it tells me to change the video renderer to something else.  I need to actually watch this movie for a Literature Quarter Project, so I would love to watch it soon so I can finish my essay early.  Help would be greatly appreciated."
