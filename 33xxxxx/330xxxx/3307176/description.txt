Notes:    Once again another fine release by FocuS and once again it was ripped straight from the Criterion Collection. Also if you want to put this up elsewhere by all means go for it just please leave everything in the folder alone. Don't switch anything. If you want to become a perm. seeder and or uploader drop us a line with your connection speed and why we should choose you and we will get back to you.
