,instinct_X,2008-10-03T17:08Z,Awful rip... encoded in DIV3 and the subtitles are in a weird font and a plain white colour that don't show up against a white background. Sadako's coming for the person who ripped this in one week's time. :-P
,bitbybitbybit,2009-12-27T16:18Z,Audio and subtitles are delayed by about 4 seconds. Skip this download...
