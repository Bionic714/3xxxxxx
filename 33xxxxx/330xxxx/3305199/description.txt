Description: Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima) is a young journalist with a divorced husband, Ryuji (Hiroyuki Sanada), and a son, Yoichi (Rikiya Otaka). Her niece, Tomoko (Yuko Takeuchi), was recently found dead with a look of pure shock embedded in her face as if something scared her to death. Upon learning that her niece's three friends died at the same time, too, and hearing about a disturbing videotape that is said to kill you seven days after watching it, Reiko comes into the possession of that same tape. Now, as time grows short, Reiko and Ryuji race to save their lives from impending doom and discover what the tape has to do with a tragedy-stricken volcanic island and a very strange little girl named Sadako (Rie Inou)...
