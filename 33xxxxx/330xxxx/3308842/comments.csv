,WaggedyAnn,2006-08-26T19:37Z,"This doesn't work.. I had the original game, Nightlife, FFS, and the Holiday Party Pack installed.

Guess what?  I ran through the installation correctly, but then I tried to start up the game and it said: 'Program has encountered an error', and I needed to click ""Don't Send"".

Then, I rebooted the computer for safety's sake, and tried to play Nightlife.

Ohh.  Nightlife is then screwed up, too.

So basically, I had to uninstall my whole friggin' game.. and it takes about 30 minutes-1 hour to finish downloading The Sims 2 original (luckily for the others it is less).  Basically, this torrent is crap and a waste of time!"

,ernaplay3,2007-03-24T15:52Z,"Don't download this! It's not works. Download a torrent with .ISO. CUE or another files works not. CD1 works, but CD2 not..."
,AmorisDolor,2007-07-01T20:10Z,"@WaggedyAnn:

I guess it's just the order you installed it that caused the problem. University is the first expansion for SIMS 2, so you should have installed this one first, and then the rest.
