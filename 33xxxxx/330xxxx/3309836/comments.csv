,timtin,2005-04-01T08:13Z,What is this???
,Networx,2005-04-01T18:42Z,"It's a 90 minute looping video of closeup shots birds, squirrels, and chipmunks in action that you let you cats watch.  It drives them insane as they try and catch the birds on the screen.  Works great on dogs too!  Endlessly hilarious."
,Gunner,2005-04-01T19:55Z,Too bad that he stopped seeding almost right away :(

,Networx,2005-04-03T21:16Z,"You're right.  Let's not make it personal. I've started seeding the file again (at least I think it is as it's uploading to tons of users).  I'll check it again tonight and see how it's going. Thanks for all the helpful advise.
Cheers!"
