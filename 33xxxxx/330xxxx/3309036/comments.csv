,rikardpah,2007-07-08T04:55Z,"HAHAAHAHAHAAAAA, ""powermetal or blackmetal"", hahahaahahahaaaahaa, yupp, ignorance is a bliss...
These guys are the creators of hardcore, think it even was Cro-mags that first mouthed the word..."
,westink,2008-04-28T14:25Z,"actually, it was the guy from d.o.a. first used the word ""hardcore"" to refer to the new kind of music being made in the mid-80's. he jokingly compared his band's music to a hardcore ron jeremy porno in an interview and it kind of stuck..."

,Bikerwade,2008-07-24T20:23Z,"filmmannetje, HARDCORE it is, you must be some teen who things this genre has something to do with electronic music. How the FUCK techno geeks or whatever come up with the brilliant idĂŠa to steal the name 15-20 years after it was established in the punk/metal scean, i can only guess. The idĂŠa is as bad as the ""music"". 

This is a great collection, but i miss Gorilla Biscuit - Start Today   ;)"
