,carpetbagger,2005-03-22T01:30Z,Does this have english subtitles?  
,atomhjärnan,2005-03-22T18:51Z,Yep. English subs.
,loopium,2005-03-22T19:01Z,"This has to be some of the most utter madness put to film in decades, I laughed myself to a sore throat. Even on a real bad day just by thinking of some of the scenes or characters brings me an evil chuckle, and life is not so bad after all -:)

high in my top ten movies list, a must see"

,atomhjärnan,2005-03-29T21:48Z,"guess I owe all you guys an apology. My internet provider (is this the correct term, btw?) shut me down last week, so I haven't been able to seed since then, but now I'm back in business. Enjoy!"
,badhad,2005-03-30T02:20Z,"OMG - it has completed.

Sorry to hear you had ISP problems (I'm in the process of looking for a new ISP myself - BT suck ass. They give you more bandwidth for free, then heavily cap your downloads - doesnt make any fricken sense). Big thanks for kicking this file back into life. Looking forward to seeing this one again.

Cheers - Badhad."

,wolverine_matt,2006-08-01T15:16Z,"The video qulaity of these files is poor. It seems it was recorded from the cinema. It really doesn't do justice to the beautiful cinematography of the film. After the length of time spent downloading, I'm a bit gutted. Go for a DVD rip instead to get full enjoyment of this film."
