Ok, ok, I know this one is a freeware for FS2004 and it is a previe edition, but this one is so damn good it could be a payware edition for FS2004 any day!

Some people say this 767-300 is as good as the LDS767 or even better!
I dont know if I wanna agree beouse I have the LDS767 but there is some realy cool fetures with this one that LDS donÂ´t hava!

The Boeing 767-300V4! The model features dynamic flexing wings that respond to turbulence. Drooping control surfaces when engines are shut off, pushback truck, RAT, opening doors, cargodoors, Flight attendant, opening cockpit window with animated flag, and many more features! Also offered are sets of high quality textures of a number of airlines from all around the world.

This aircraft is not a finish product right now, just a preview! But it is well worth to try this one!
