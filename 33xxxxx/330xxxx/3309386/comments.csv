,mave_sweden,2005-04-01T13:47Z,"Hi all! 
First of all, I really appreciate the work you have put in making this torrent. But I  can't playback the file.
 I downloaded the file ""xvidcore-1.1.0-beta1"" from Xvid.org but I don't know ife I'm in the righ direction, I always use VLC to playmy files so I havn't installed a codec manually yet =/... 
Any kind of help would be thanks m^^m"
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-01T20:32Z,"Mave,

You can get the new XviD codec here:

http://www.koepi.org/XviD-1.1.0-Beta1-16012005.exe

Just run it.

Open the ""XviD Decoder Configerator"" from ""start"" ""programs"" ""xvid""

For top quality, make sure you use the XviD decoder configerator, and turn on
(Y) and (UV) deblocking, and the new feature of XviD 1.1.0 (Y) and (UV) DERINGING.

It should play back fine even under a divx only system, as in, you only have a divx 5.xx codec installed.  I can't speak for any other versions of divx."

CPR100 is a bit different from anadrol 50;) The movie shows Arnold smoking weed in the end,though. "
[T],sickboy88,2005-05-26T09:19Z,"True..kind of...there is a writeup about this movie from the now dead dan ducane (steroid guru) they talks about how they filled the vitamin bottles with roids.  If you zoom in, you'll notice that they are the original 50mg dbol...which were given to pow's in the 60's and the 70's.  Pretty sick shit.  Very observant of you, but you can't be blamed for reading the bottle."
