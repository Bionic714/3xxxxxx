Pumping Iron

Great documentary about bodybuilding.  This is the least censored version I've ever encountered on DVD.  I have the 100% uncut version on VHS if anyone is interested.

In this version Arnold Schwarzenegger is clearly seen smoking marijuana towards the end of the movie, as well as popping handfulls of Dianabol, Anadrol 50, and other steroids along with Lou Ferrigno taking them as well.

This version also includes the scene were Arnold describes being pumped up as COMING or shooting a load.

This version is totally complete except for 10 extra seconds of marijuana smoking.  He still has about 6-9 seconds of weed smoking in this version.  You can clearly hear and see it.
