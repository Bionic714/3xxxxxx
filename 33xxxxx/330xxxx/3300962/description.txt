Embraced by the music press with the rest of the New Rock 
Revolution of the early '00's, The Raveonettes had already 
made waves in their native Denmark. Their debut mini-album 
'Whip It On' was a critical success and received the honour 
of winning Best Album at the Danish Music Awards in 2003.
 
Melding influences new and old, the band have created their 
own unique musical identity, coming across somewhere between 
'60s girl group pop and claustrophobic '80s drone-rock, such 
as Jesus And The Mary Chain. They release their first full-length 
album, 'Chain Gang Of Love', in September 2003. 

Enjoy.
