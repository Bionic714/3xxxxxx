,ihitterdal,2007-07-24T17:25Z,"You know, while downloading this torrent, I thought of this:  Until all J-Rock and J-Pop (or at least a notable amount) can be gained in America through most stores, I will keep downloading music from those genres."
,ihitterdal,2007-07-25T01:21Z,"Lousy lack of an edit function...

Stuck at 96.4, like the other guys.  Please seed!

They need an edit function AND a ""please reseed"" request button."
