Fråga: Har du möjligtvis nån gång rippat ""Chick Trick"" filmerna ?
Tror det är samma bolag som ""bang Bus""...

(translation)
Just asking the almighty Redreb if he has some ""Chick Trick"" vids for us lowly porn crawlers :P"
,benzfriend,2005-03-29T00:08Z,"One vote no for http://springthomas.com

Redreb - the combination of the preview pictures & descriptions are great - no need to waste time & bandwidth downloading something your not into."
,Redreb,2005-03-29T01:09Z,"shikome....i´m not sure about those ""chick trick"" movies
As far as i can remember that site is VERY old..and the girls too
I saw them on the kazaa network when i used it back in the old days (maybe 2-3 years ago).

the site doesn´t seem to release new stuff either...

,Ateist,2005-03-29T19:09Z,Why don't anyone have siterips from video-lo or exploitedteens?
,Redreb,2005-03-29T19:51Z,"well i can start posting from Http://exploitedteens.com
