Plot Summary for Deliverance (1972)

Canoeing down a river, four city men run into some unfriendly locals. Unable to escape from the gorge in which the river runs, the locals become more and more of a threat.

On a weekend canoeing trip down a river in the Georgia back country, four urban businessmen enter a nightmare in which both nature and mankind conspire to send them through a crucible of danger and degradation in which their lives and perhaps even their souls are put at horrendous risk.

Based on James Dickey's novel, this film tells the story of an ill-fated canoe trip in deep backwoods America, where the people are as scary as the country is beautiful.
