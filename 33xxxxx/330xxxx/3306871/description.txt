This is Eastern flavoured hard and heavy psychedelic rock as only the Japanese can do it. Complete with high pitched wailing vocals and a mix of doom and blues. You’ll hear more than a hint of Sabbath ,I think, when they rock out. But then they stone you out with the coolest electric guitar mantras you’ll ever hear. The vocals might actually put you off, but if you can get past them, or even enjoy them, this is a top notch album, up there with the best Japan had to offer. Note that track 6 might be a bonus track, I am not sure yet, but all references I find to the original release only mention the first 5 tracks. The notes in the cover I have are Japanese! Haha.
Enjoy!
