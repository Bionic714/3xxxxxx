Stealther (formerly Stealth Anonymizer) is a proxy server agent that lets you travel the Internet with maximum possible privacy. It contains a large auto-updated database of anonymous proxy servers and allows you to easily logon to them and test their anonymity. This network of publicly accessible servers shield your current connection when you visit websites, download files, or use web-based e-mail accounts. For example, the Super-Stealth mode (not available in the evaluation version) claims to route your surfing request over a proxy cascade of independent stealth nodes half way across the globe to Russia or thailand, making it impossible to trace your real location. Additional features are skin support, firewall support, support for LAN gateways and a cookie control feature with custom rules. While this program will mask your identity successfully, it also tends to slow down your surfing, since it depends on the speed and availability of public proxy surfers.
