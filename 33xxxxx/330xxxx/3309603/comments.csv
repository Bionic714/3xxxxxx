Anyways, thanks for the cool INVASiON releases :) I love them!"
,hlime,2005-04-01T17:39Z,"I concur, the audio sync is off."
,grimzy,2005-04-02T17:31Z,You can sync the audio with MPlayer.. atleast with the Linux version.. haven't tested the Win32 Binary..
,mama,2005-04-04T01:53Z,"""-13.2"" Second Delay in MPlayer (win32 and *nix works) audio stream (-delay)... syncs up pretty close to perfectly."
