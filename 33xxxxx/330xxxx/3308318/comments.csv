,Mordeath,2006-01-20T22:14Z,"PLease seed i'm stuck on 97,9%. Thanks !"
,aloC-,2006-02-02T20:48Z,seed please
,v3ng3anc3,2006-02-15T23:19Z,"Seed it some1 plz, we all stuck there with 99.6%"
,milli_g,2006-05-08T02:05Z,"Can someone with a completed download please seed? there are many of us stuck at 99,6%. Anyway many thanks goes to the original uploader ""Gpz900r"" for sharing this movie, best action flick ever made. Cheers!"
,milli_g,2006-05-23T00:14Z,"Please inform us if this torrent is lost/dead. At this point I have uploaded over 25GB. and everyday there are new users connecting. It's a waste of bandwidth for everyone if the dead end stops at 99,6%. I found it strange that this movie only has been downloaded 1400times, You can not find better action flick than this. This director's cut full untouched DVD edition should rank at the TOP100 list at the TPB. Can someone please seed just for a short while, many of us can take over after that. This only happens because most people/downloaders don't upload as much as they download and wanish after they reach 100%. A sharing ratio of 1:1 is moraly a must if you got a soul and if you want this tracker to stay ALIVE!. TPB needs a rating/ratio system and a track log in order to force people to reach a 1:1 ratio if they want to continue and use this tracker. Hopefully someday... Cheers!"
,CobraStromberg,2006-05-24T16:49Z,"seeda.. 99,6%.."
,ruva,2006-06-17T00:50Z,"Works great with 96,6% in DVDshrink, don´t forgot the dvd-9 setting and you dont lose a thing.

Fungerar i DVDshrink fast ni bara får ner 99,6% bara ni inte glömmer att ställa in följande:
Bocka ur ""split vobfiles""
Ställ in till DVD-9

Kopiera till en mapp, byt namn på den största filen till T3.mpg och ni kan spela filmen felfritt på er dator eller Mediaspelare till TV (Pinnacle Showcenter 1000/200 mm)."
