   Install note :


   Unpack, install ...


   Note :

   You must first install Eclipse 3.0 and XMLSpy 2005 Enterprise Edition 
   before you can install this Integration package."

This isn't XML Spy, it's a free eclipse plugin that requires xml spy to be installed.  And xml spy is not included with this package."
