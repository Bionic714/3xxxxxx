Isn't it better too have a ""new"" game in two days rather than not at all?

,uggenabben,2005-03-13T12:16Z,"Naturally we appreciate having a new game!!! Personally I was just a bit worried, I am sorry if I came out as a ""gnällspik""! Thanks, again!"

,jobasus,2005-03-15T08:16Z,Hur man packa upp denna???
,MoPeder,2005-03-20T01:00Z,"Thanks! Nice game ;)


jobasus: man packar upp den genom att öppna t.ex. .001 filen med winrar och sen trycka på ""packa upp"" (eller kanske ""extract"" om du har en engelsk winrar)"
,MoPeder,2005-03-20T01:06Z,"vänta lite här... ""Enjoy that cool game based on the animated movie some days before it will your local shelves !""

Det var väl ändå lite att ta i med tanke på att spelet kom ut för ungefär 1 ½ år sedan :P"
