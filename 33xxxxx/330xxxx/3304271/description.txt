Or do a Google search and you'll find a lot of stuff about her.

In short I can say that the japs got bizzare tast and customs. They are crazy, but they say that we are crazy so we're even. 

Personally I am quite amazed by them. Yuki Terai is a VR celebrity and she was huge in Japan. I guess the real thing wasn't

These eight clips are ripped from the DVD "Yuki Terai Secrets" and every part has their own story while two of them are music videos she was famous for.

Escapi is a small group and they released three Virtually Real DVDs in 2002. They might not be able to compete with craphic designers of today but nothing can match the japs when it comes to plot lines.
