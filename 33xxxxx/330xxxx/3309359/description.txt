I liked this movie actually - although it only has a 6.2 rating on imdb.

I used DVD-RB with CCE 5 passes.  I'm not sure that it really looks better than dvd2one output.. but not worse either anyhow.  The bit-rate is high enough in this 105 minute movie to ensure a pleasant viewing experience.  There are no menus at all -- just goes straight into the movie.

audio: english 5.1
subs: english and spanish

enjoy!
