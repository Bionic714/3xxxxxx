  <li><strong>Movie title:</strong> Mr Hong</li><li><strong>Director:</strong> Gang Seok Beom</li><li><strong>Genre:</strong> Comedy / Drama</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2004</li><li><strong>Rating:</strong> 5.7/10 (53 votes)</li><li><strong>IMDB link:</strong> <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0398045/" target="_blank">http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0398045/</a></li>  </ul>
  <p><strong>Plot:</strong> With a good-looking countenance and of fairly good height, 30 year-old Hong (played by Kim Juhyeok) is a jack-of-all-trades. Currently working as a "banjang" (meaning "the head of a neighborhood association"), he does everything from delivering Chinese noodles to working part time at a noodle house, supermarket, and live cafe, to repairing gadgets and working as an interior designer. Rumor has it that he was once a bodyguard for a famous singer in the States, while others say that he was an official interpreter at the Korea-U.S. summit, among others, though nothing has been confirmed. After all, like Costner, he becomes a trouble-solving broker exactly when troubles begin. A cinematic debut by director Kang Seokbeom, this romantic comedy begins when he encounters a morally-conscious "perfectionist" dentist Yun Hyejin (Eom Jeonghwa). Hyejin one day loses her job after protesting for the rights of medical doctors and opens a new dental clinic in a small fishing village where Hong lives. Although she appears to him as a troublemaker, he saves her from the start, wielding his strength like Neo did in the "The Matrix" and as Kevin Costner's character did in "The Bodyguard." When it comes to the level of jobs, the two are not easily compatible with each other. She is a high brow medical doctor, while he is engaged in every 3 "D" ("dirty, difficult and dangerous") job. Although she initially boasts of her high "social position," the undaunted and formidable Hong is unfazed. This movie might have been dull because it only focuses on two main characters. The director, however, adroitly overcomes the potential mediocrity by displaying many of the diverse occupations Hong has and unfolds the mystery surrounding the man as his nickname "H file" - modeled after "X File" - suggests.</p>    <h1>Cover</h1>
