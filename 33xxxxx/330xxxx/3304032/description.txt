A special note from Filmmaker Alex Jones:

"This is the best film I've ever made. Its contents are very important to the future of this country and the world. Martial Law is 2 hours and 35 minutes in duration but is really 3 different films. The information contained in this film is so important that I am releasing it immediately in VHS format with a forthcoming DVD version of the film available in one month. I felt that if we delayed the introduction of Martial Law to release the two together, The Globalists could carry out an attack dwarfing 9/11 at any time and Martial Law 9/11: The Rise of the Police State might never be seen by the people who need this information the most."

"This is unlike any 9/11 film you've ever seen. I'm credited with being the first person in the country to release a 9/11 expose, three weeks after September 11 (9/11 Emergency Release). Be assured, Martial Law is the best work I've ever done. Please get this film and educate yourself and others by making copies of it for not-for-profit, educational purposes, because it really does reveal the 'big picture' and expose the power behind the throne."
