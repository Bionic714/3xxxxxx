,bearcy,2005-06-08T23:22Z,"This program also has the benefit of encoding MP3 Pro - in 96 kbps stereo and 48 kbps mono (44.1 kHz). Please always deselect ""Joint stereo"" or ""Joint mono"", and select instead clean ""Stereo"" or ""Mono"". What this ""Joint-""-filter does, is to level out the dynamics of the recording. This means that when the audio level is low, the recording level rises, and when some loud voice or sound breaks off the silence, the first few seconds gets distorted and difficult to hear, until the program has got the point and reacted to it, by lowering the recording-level back to normal. All MP3-encoders I have installed, has had ""Joint stereo"" as their default setting: Most probably to destroy the recording sufficiently to make us all prefer CDs to MP3s. If you, however selects clean ""Stereo"" or ""Mono"", the highest quality of MP3 Pro (Fraunhofer) sounds just like a CD! And is usable as backup for Audio-CDs to use in Audio-CD environments. An MP3-pro file of 96 kbps encoded in 44.1 kHz, sounds just right, after I've extracted it and burned it onto an Audio-CDR again. One Audio CD of 80 minutes (700 MB) becomes in MP3 Pro (Fraunhofer) 44.1 kHz approximately 55 MB in stereo and 23 MB in mono. And with the ability to store the information of a dozen Audio-CDs on one CDR, or 80 × 80-minutes CDs on one DVDR, and back again without loss. :o)"

,bearcy,2007-12-21T16:39Z,"Please be sure always to block for all files in this program from access to an from the Internet in your FireWall program! Or remove the physical connection to the Internet from your PC before opening this program.

First Internet access this program gets, and it disables itself, and will be impossible to reinstall!

Also be sure to run it only from - or with the properties of - the Windows profile in which it was installed; or the MP3-pro encoder will only give you 30 trial runs!"
,bearcy,2007-12-21T16:49Z,"When using Steinberg WaveLab 5 to make MP3-pro files in 1 channel mono, please use 56 kpbs in 44 kHz and 16 bit for CD-quality. 48 kbps produces a dull treble, that will only degrade the sound, and make it uncomfortable to listen to. This is my experience."

hope we don't have to wait too long."

You guys actually don't know this stuff?

Also, the download includes the .NFO file and .EXE file, is that all?"
