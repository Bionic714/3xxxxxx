,hvm,2008-05-04T11:48Z,"yeah, please seed, we have 0.998 coverage..."
,hargle,2008-05-10T01:55Z,"I don't know what the procedure is for this sort of thing, or if it is even possible, but I think that there should be a merge between this torrent, and http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3363800/Season_1. The link provided has better coverage, but really bad speed, while the coverage here is just short of incomplete, while being of adequate bandwidth availability... and for the same files(might be different names, though). Anyways, if the two torrents combined, it would be better."
,chton1,2009-03-17T16:39Z,seed please
,ericn32,2009-05-20T03:36Z,"Please seed this torrent, we only need .02% of the files!"
