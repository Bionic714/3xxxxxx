Lucasarts Entertainment Company Presents:

Full Throttle


One minute you're on the road, riding. The some guy in a suit comes along,
says he's got a deal for you and your gang. But when you come to, you've
got a lump on your head, the law on your back, and a feeling in your gut that
the road you're on is about to get a lot rougher...

BEAT UP. BUSTED. MAD. Ben's been double-crossed before. But this time they
messed with his gang, they trashed his bike, and they're about to come back
for more. What they're all gonna get is up to you.

BLOW YOUR SPEAKERS with movie-quality sound and a full digital score
featuring the Gone Jackals - an authentic hard-hammerin' biker band!

Motorcycles. Mayham. Murder.
