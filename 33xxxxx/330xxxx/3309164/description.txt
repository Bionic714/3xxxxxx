Introduction
============

ToxicBIOS is a third party flash upgrade for the DMS4 Lite and Pro modchips by
Team Toxic. Our goal is to provide a host of features which DMS4 owners deserve,
but are sadly lacking in the factory default "legal" flash. Thanks to the 
superior hardware design of the DMS4 series chips, we have been able to create 
a freeware flash replacement which will unlock your modchips full potential 
and enable your console to do things you have only dreamed of :)

Current features provided by ToxicBIOS are as follows:

- Auto-detect and non-swap booting of all disc types (PS2, DVD, PSX, etc)
- Support for DVD+R dual layer media
- Compatible with all PS2 models V1-V12
- Dev.olution mode (from memory card and HDD)
- DVD region free, Macrovision removal and green screen fix for the DVD player
- Auto-ATAD patching for HDD-enabled games
- Fast boot mode for PS2, PSX and DVD movies
- Support for the HDD browser upgrade on a non-Sony HDD
- Set default boot mode to: Normal, MC/HDD Dev.olution, Fast Boot
- Playstation 2 game video fix (Colour Carrier, PAL, NTSC, PAL60), with
  automatic y-position correction
- Playstation 1 game video fix
- Enable MegaMemory memory cards without the need for the boot disc
- Configuration menu where various settings can be manipulated
- "Toxic" logo displayed at the PS2 logo screen
- When booting from Dev.olution mode or Fast Boot, games use correct language
- Modchip disable mode, for online gaming
- Support for the Codebreaker cheat device
- 100% boot rate
- Much, much more to come!

*****************************************************************************
NOTE: All HDD related features are unsupported on the PStwo (V12) console for
      obvious reasons ;)
*****************************************************************************

Detailed Feature Overview
=========================

-> Dev.olution mode

   Using Dev.olution mode you can boot applications from either the memory
   card or hard disk drive. When booting in MC Dev.olution mode, the ELF file
   "mc0:/BOOT/BOOT.ELF" is launched. This ELF file can be anything you want, 
   such as DMS Explorer, PS2Menu, PS2OS etc. To boot in MC Dev.olution mode
   either hold down TRIANGLE on controller 1 while the PS2 is booting, or
   set default boot mode to MC Dev.olution in the configuration menu. Currently
   the only application which can be launched with HDD Dev.olution mode is
   DMS HDD Explorer. Once HDD Explorer is installed, you may boot in HDD
   Dev.olution mode by either holding down START on controller 1 while the PS2
   is booting, or set default boot mode to HDD Dev.olution in the configuration
   menu.

   NOTE: From ToxicBIOS v1.2 and up you must use DMS HDD Explorer v1.3 or
         greater. Older versions are no longer supported.

-> ATAD auto-patching

   When ATAD auto-patching is enabled, you can connect a non-Sony HDD to your
   PS2 and use it as though it was an official Sony drive. You will be able
   to install and use the HDD browser update (found on the HDD utility disc) on
   a non-Sony HDD, and you will be able to partially install some games with
   HDD support to improve performance.. even though this is a bit pointless
   with the existence of HDLoader ^_^

-> Fast boot mode

   Fast boot mode allows you to skip the redundant "swirling electrons" and
   various logo screens and directly load your PS2/PSX game or DVD movie as 
   soon as you turn on the console, saving valuable time which would be better 
   spent gaming. To use fast boot mode, either hold down SELECT while the PS2 
   is booting or set default boot mode to fast boot in the configuration menu. 

-> DVD+R dual layer media support

   Until now it has been impossible to play DVD9 games backed up onto dual
   layer media on the PS2 due to a problem with reading from the second layer
   because the data format on burnt DL discs is different than on pressed
   discs (burnt = OTP, pressed = PTP). However, we have discovered a software
   hack which enables the PS2 to read even burnt OTP discs meaning it is now
   possible to make backups of dual layer games such as GT4. ToxicBIOS includes
   an "auto-patching" mechanism which applies this patch on the fly. The
   auto-patcher is disabled by default, to enable set "DVD+R DL Support" in
   the settings menu.

   NOTE: Unfortunately due to software restrictions the auto-patching will
         not work if you boot your DL backup from the updated Sony browser
	 stored on the HDD. If you are using the updated browser then in
	 order to play your DL backups you must boot them with fastboot. 
	 If you are not using the browser update then there are no
	 limitations regarding how you can boot DL backups.

-> Default boot mode

   Using the configuration menu you can set the default boot mode to one of the
   following: Normal, Fast Boot, MC Dev.olution, HDD Dev.olution. If you do not
   manually specify a boot mode while the PS2 is booting by holding down a
   button on controller 1, the default boot mode will be used. For example if
   the default boot mode is set to MC Dev.olution, when you turn on the PS2
   without holding down any buttons on the controller, your MC Dev.olution
   application will be loaded from the memory card. If you then wish to boot
   normally (i.e.: boot through standard browser) hold down CROSS on controller
   1 while booting to over-ride the default boot mode.

-> Playstation 2 game video fix

   There are 4 different modes for the PS2 video MODE fix, as described below:

   - Colour Carrier: The colour carrier of the video signal is changed to
     match the region of your console.
   - Force PAL: Video mode forced to PAL (50hz), regardless of what video mode
     games try to set.
   - Force NTSC: Video mode forced to NTSC (60hz), regardless of what video
     mode games try to set.
   - Force PAL60: Video mode forced to PAL60, which is 60hz with PAL colour
     carrier.

   In addition to the PS2 video MODE fix, you can also enable the PS2 video
   Y-POS fix. The y-position fix is used in conjunction with the PS2 video
   MODE fix in order to correct the vertical position of the display. For
   example, simply focing PAL when a NTSC game is running will generally result
   in the display being far off center. The y-position fix corrects this and
   centers the display. Please note that the y-position fix is not available
   when the PS2 video MODE fix is off or set to Color Carrier, since in these
   cases the video mode is not forced so the display position will not need
   to be corrected. Please note that the y-position fix feature should still
   be considered EXPERIMENTAL and has been known to cause problems with a few
   games. If a game isnt working, disable the y-position fix and see if this
   helps.

   You can configure the PS2 video MODE and PS2 video Y-POS fixes in the
   configuration menu.
   
-> Configuration Menu

   The configuration menu is used to manipulate various ToxicBIOS settings, for
   example enabling or disabling ATAD auto-patching. The configuration menu also
   displays useful information about your PS2 system and DMS4 modchip. To enter
   the configuration menu, hold down SQUARE on controller 1 while the PS2 is
   booting.

-> Disable Mode

   When playing online games it is often necessary to disable the modchip so you
   do not get a DNAS error while connecting to the online game server. To
   disable DMS4, hold down L1 on controller 1 as the PS2 is booting. You will
   see a message saying that the modchip has been disabled. Insert your game and
   reset the console - the modchip will not be disabled and will stay disabled
   until the PS2 is placed in standby.

-> Codebreaker cheat device support

   The more recent codebreaker cheat devices include a protection system which
   is designed to detect the presence of modchips and prevent the application
   from working on a modified system. ToxicBIOS bypasses this protection and
   allows codebreaker to work properly, however you must first set
   "Auto Tray Eject" to OFF in the options menu.

Boot-time controller mapping
============================

When the console is booting, holding down certain buttons on controller 1 will
activate certain modes/features. These are listed below:

   CROSS    - Use standard boot (over-ride default boot mode setting)
   TRIANGLE - MC Dev.olution mode
   START    - HDD Dev.olution mode
   SELECT   - Fast boot mode
   SQUARE   - Load configuration menu
   L1       - Disable modchip

How to Install
==============

Installation directions vary depending on boot method:

- ELF boot: Simply execute the ELF using your favorite loader application 
  (PS2Menu, PS2Link, Naplink, PS2OS, LaunchELF etc) and follow the on-screen 
  directions.

- CD boot: Simply burn the BIN/CUE provided, boot the disc and follow the
  on-screen directions.

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Q: Can I disable the "Toxic" logo displayed under the Playstation 2 logo when
   booting PS2 games?
A: Yes. Set "Display Toxic Logo" to NO in the configuration menu.

Q: Why do I get the "TV system doesn't match" error while trying to play a
   DVD movie?
A: You will be presented with this error if you attempt to play a PAL movie on
   a NTSC console. This is due to a limitation in the DVD player software and
   currently there is no way around this. We are looking into ways to fix this
   and hopefully a fix will be included in a future ToxicBIOS release.

Q: I have a feature request or bug report for Team Toxic. How can I contact you?
A: We do not provide any contact details such as e-mail addresses etc, however 
   we do monitor various "scene" forums so if you have a request or a problem
   then just make a post and there is a good chance we will see it and take note
   of it :)

Q: I have a game which isnt loading or working prorperly. What can I do?

   1) Disable y-position fix if it is enabled. This is still experimental and
      has been known to cause problems with a few games.
   2) Make sure that the game is burnt on good quality media at an appropriate
      speed. If your PS2's laser cannot read from your disc, the game will
      obviously not work.

Group News
==========

Team Toxic is also working on a patcher for DVD9 games which will allow you
to patch the disc image so it can be burnt onto DVD+R DL media and used with
any modchip. The effect is similar to the auto-patcher already integrated
into our flash except the patch is applied before the disc is burnt and not
as it is loaded.

However, we had to question if this was a good idea when we learnt that
certain modchip manufacturers have been planning to rip our DVD+R DL patching
code since it was originally announced, long before the actual ToxicOS release.
We have decided to still release this for the good of the scene however - but
if you see DVD+R support appear in other modchips in the near future please
keep in mind where this came from originally :)

Miscellaneous
=============

ToxicBIOS may be hosted by anybody, anywhere - PROVIDED that the archive
remains unaltered and that it is not used in ways its not supposed to be!

Oh, and props to the DMS team for making such a nice modchip - even though
the flash they ship with the chip sucks and cant do much of anything :P
