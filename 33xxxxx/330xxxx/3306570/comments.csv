,tpb_seeda,2005-03-25T22:23Z,"Sorry to anyone grabbing the old torrent with the three albums... just figured this would be a more productive torrent. Very awesome band, fairly unheard of. Hope everyone enjoys this. :)"

,supersuper1970,2008-07-13T22:55Z,"ItÂ´s great this torrent, I don't understand why for many people (like me)  It gets stucked almost to finish"
,mkdarqchylde,2008-10-09T01:43Z,"So yeah... Did I just waste my time waiting on this only to have it stop at 99.5%? It would be super awesome if someone, mainly the person who uploaded it, could seed this, so the 9 million of us so close to a complete download could wait no more and help others by seeding ourselves."
,paradoxfox93,2008-11-18T11:17Z,"I have quite a bit of Bella Morte Already but not all.

Once I meet the rest of you at %99 or so I will remake the torrent with the missing songs if I have them

Maybe you can say which songs are affected by the missing data so I can make sure I do?"
,paradoxfox93,2008-11-19T02:13Z,"I only have two of the 5 songs missing :(

I will search for these songs but no promises."
,latensi,2009-03-14T20:52Z,"please, seed me just a little more, im on the 99.5% i promise i'll seed for a few weeks so everyone else can enjoy this magnificent music"
,paradoxfox93,2009-08-06T13:28Z,"Great toorent.  Thanks. Will seed.  But Angels & Faith and Evensong have their title switched ~.^

Also, One Winters Night and Angels & Faith (The acutal song) are completely jacked.  idk what's wrong with them but they sound like shit and those are my two favorite songs =("
