,Rall,2005-03-26T06:26Z,"thanx, this is really coool:) and just so you all know, it was the german engineer who made the v1 and v2 rockets who made the rocket that usa went to the moon with...without him the us would never have won the race for the moon.. German technology and engineering was superior to any allied during ww2 and after...both us and russia used german rocket and weapon technology they found after the war, and weapons today are based on it still..The us took many highly skilled engineers back to usa after the war, and made them work for them, so did russia, but the us got the best of them...

The Nazi's atomic bomb research project was thankfully still born, but the research lab at KWI in Berlin had a sufficient pile of high grade Uranium to make several bombs. This Uranium was likely used in the first test bombs detonated by the Soviets in the 1950s."
