Hey guys first time uploading on this. But this is a little program from www.xbox-saves.com You can manage your saves from this program. It doesn't sound all that great but for those of you who always download ileets great updates for xbmc this could be for you! Some times going threw the saves folder ppl can accidently delete the wrong save when you are loading on the newest xbmc build. With this just double click and  log onto your xbox with it and all the names of all your saves are on. It is very easy and wuick to use. Also great if you download saves.

Enjoy!
