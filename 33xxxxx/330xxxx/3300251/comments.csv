,neonreach,2006-03-31T07:13Z,Any chance of a seed for this?
,DeathRoar,2006-07-05T01:24Z,"Their right to oppress the world through christian morals in the court room and the right of discrimination, fuck this documentary death to christianity in america, death to george bush"
,asp314,2008-03-10T03:30Z,"You're right adric22.  George Bush would never wish death to Deathroar: he'd much rather get us into a war that we didn't need just so he could profit from Deathroar's spending on the rising gas prices.  As for Christians, the only ones that I deem to be as peaceful as you claim would be the ones that are capable of religious tolerance.  I applaud Temptation for this upload.  Reliqion has no place in politics, and its only use in real life is to provide a moral backbone for its followers.  I only wish there were more seeders."
,Temptation,2008-04-03T03:13Z,"a couple of years after I uploaded this documentary and made my comments above, I want to make a small revision to my comments.  

Bush and the Republican party, and for that matter, the entire American ruling class, which includes the Democratic party and various interests groups such as AIPAC, are not so much motivated by religious reasons as much as they are by wealth, power, and control.  They simply use religion as one way to propagandize and manufacture consent for the imperial and mass-murdering US foreign policy in the Middle-East, which at its core, is simply about controlling the vast reserves of oil in the Middle-East, and making sure the American corporations get a piece of the vast wealth that these oil reserves generate.

It certainly helps that America is one of the few, if not the only Western liberal democracy, consisting of a pliable and disturbingly large percentage of religous fundamentalists.  Nowhere else in the West is there such a level of religious fanaticism and outright racist and ignorance.  This makes it all the easier for the American ruling class and various interests groups, such as AIPAC and the corporate elites, oil companies and defence contractors, to convince the US public of Muslim irrationality and to stir up the racist and vicious and in most cases, downright ignorant and apathetic US public and get their consent for America's vicious military aggression, mass-murder and genocide of other people and other nations, from Indo-China in the 70s, to Latin America in the 60s to the 80s, to the Middle-East today."
