History of Hitler’s Empire, 2nd Edition
(12 lectures, 30 minutes/lecture)
Course No. 805

Taught by Thomas Childers
University of Pennsylvania
Ph.D., Harvard University
   
 
Know thy enemy. That’s what the wisdom of history teaches us. 

And Adolph Hitler was surely the greatest enemy ever faced by modern 
civilization. Over half a century later, the horror and fascination 
still linger. 

No one is better able to explain the unexplainable about this man and 
his movement than professor Thomas Childers. 

With these lectures, you will see what great teaching is all about. 
As the Student Course Evaluations at the University of Pennsylvania 
put it: "Words do not seem adequate to describe Professor Childers." 

Two Crucial Questions

Professor Childers has designed this course to answer two burning questions 
that have nagged mankind ever since Hitler and Nazism were destroyed.---

1) How could a man like Adolf Hitler and a movement like Nazism come 
to power in, of all places, 20th-century Germany? After all, this was 
a highly educated, industrially developed country at the very heart 
of Western Europe. 

2) How were the Nazis able to establish the foundations of a totalitarian 
regime in such a short time and hurl all of Europe—and the world—into 
a devastating war that would consume so many millions of lives?

And the answers lead us to other questions:

Who voted for the Nazis and why? How did the Nazis campaign? What did 
they seem to stand for? 
Why was there apparently so little resistance? 
What made the regime popular at home? 
How were the Nazis able to seize control of the press, the radio, the 
courts, and police with so little trouble? 
Can it happen again? 
What must we do to make sure that it doesn’t? 
How did it all begin? 
You start by exploring the catastrophic impact of World War I on Germany 
and how the war and the humiliating Treaty of Versailles crippled the 
Weimar Republic. 

The Repercussions of the Versailles Treaty in Germany

Until the very end of World War I, despite enormous casualties in trench 
warfare and great sacrifices on the home front, Germany had appeared 
to be winning. 

Then, in November 1918, the roof suddenly caved in. Inexplicably to 
many Germans, Germany had lost the war! 

The new democratic government, the Weimar Republic, was forced by the 
victorious Allies to sign a humiliating treaty and begin its political 
life carrying a staggering burden. You learn:

how this widened divisions already present in German society 
how it created the setting in which extreme nationalist movements could 
thrive.
Then you examine short-term factors that help explain Hitler’s rise 
to power:

the grave economic problems confronting the Weimar government upon which 
Hitler and his minions fed: the chaotic hyperinflation of 1923, the 
harsh stabilization of 1924, and the Great Depression 
the deep cleavages—religious divisions, lingering regional loyalties, 
and growing social or class tension—that made nation-building in the 
new Germany so difficult 
how the Nazis used innovative modern campaign techniques to exploit 
the economic hardship of the day: here is the first use in politics 
of exit polls, radio appeal, and use of aircraft by the candidate 
just which German voters found the Nazis appealing, and why. 
Hitler in Power: The Third Reich

The second half of the course deals with Nazism in power, the Third 
Reich. These lectures answer the question of how President Hindenburg 
came to name Hitler as chancellor in January 1933, at a time when Nazi 
appeal was waning. 

And they show how Hitler and his henchmen began systematically and ruthlessly 
breaking resistance, taking over the major institutions of state power 
and creating a totalitarian system of terror, propaganda, and pervasive 
regimentation. 

Hitler’s Wars: Why and How?

By 1935, with power now firmly in Nazi hands, the ideological core of 
the National Socialist movement began to reveal itself. 

Professor Childers anatomizes Hitler’s horrifying racial ideas and the 
policies adopted to transform those ideas into reality. He describes 
the Nazis’ mounting repression of the Jewish population and the role 
of the SS in shaping and enforcing these anti-Semitic policies.

Hitler as Global Chess Player

Next comes Hitler’s conduct of foreign policy between 1933 and 1939. 

You see how he outmaneuvered the apprehensive Western European powers 
and how and why he puzzled the world by entering into an accommodation 
with his deadly enemy, Stalin, on the eve of World War II. 

You see why the Munich agreement was such an important turning point, 
the seeming triumph of National Socialism on the world stage.

The "Final Solution"

In his closing lectures, Professor Childers focuses on Hitler’s war 
against the Jews from Mein Kampf to Auschwitz.

Hitler’s war was not simply a traditional geopolitical conflict, a grab 
for land and resources; it was a racial war as well. It is revealed 
most obviously in the ideological war against the Soviet Union.

Hitler saw his enemy as a "Judeo-Bolshevist" conspiracy, which he was 
called on to eliminate. This meant not only a war of annihilation of 
the Soviet Union; it also meant the destruction of the European Jewish 
community.

Professor Childers shows how Hitler conducted his war against the Jews 
to the very end and how, finally after so much death and destruction, 
his evil empire itself was destroyed by Allied might.

"Should I buy Audio or Video?"

This course works well in any format. The DVD and videotape versions 
feature dozens of illustrations, including portraits, photographs, maps, 
and on-screen graphics. (Note: Given the nature of the course subject, 
some photographs include graphic depictions of the Nazi period and the 
Holocaust.)
