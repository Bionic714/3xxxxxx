you obviously have yet to find actual concentration camp footage... it´s out there.. Go find it.. don´t ask me to do your job for you.. 
if your REALLY critical .. then you REALLY haveto do some digging, exploring, reading and swallow some pathetic pride.. 

leaders are not infallible. we´d like to believe they are .. as it comforts us when we place our trust in them. In reality being critical and learned takes alot of energy and time.. 

i hope one day when you find answers you slap yourself in the face for being so blindly brainwashed that you didn´t think it happened..

After you've familiarized yourself with the basic structures of irrational belief and faulty reasoning, ask yourself why Holocaust denial is any more reasonable than believing that Elvis is alive and well and working at a Burger King in San Antonio.
