<font size="1"><b>The Story</b>

First off, there’s no reason that any Xbox owner shouldn’t have at least dabbled in former Splinter Cell titles, but there are probably a few stragglers that wonder what the hype is all about. Sam Fisher is a grizzled spec ops vet that has been part of the ultra hush-hush U.S. initiative called Third Echelon. The operatives of Third Echelon are merely shadows; they don’t exist. When politics gets in the way of international security, Sam is part of the group that gets their hands dirty.</b></font>

and Spanish language has been removed.</b>
