The career of Count Basie defies the norm. More consistent than virtually any of his contemporaries, Basie never made a big band record that didn't swing hard. On THE BASIE BIG BAND, trumpeters Frank Szabo and Dave Stahl had just recently joined the band. Drummer Butch Miles, playing in the Buddy Rich mold, had also joined the band only months before this session. All this invigorated an already swinging orchestra. On THE BASIE BIG BAND, we hear nine Sam Nestico charts (not to be confused with cousin and tenor player Sal Nestico). Among them are some of Nestico's most famous compositions including "Freckle Face," "The Heat's On," and "The Wind Machine." There is much to applaud on this release. Whether it be Pete Minger's trumpet solo on "Orange Sherbet," Dave Stahl's powerful lead work on "Tall Cotton" or Butch Miles' blazing drum breaks on "Wind Machine," this album cooks!

the title says it all...big band Basie, pure & simple - this hard driving 1975 session with his orchestra features arrangements by Sam Nestico & a stellar crew of Basie stalwarts including Freddie Green, Al Grey & Jimmy Forrest
