LOOOOOOOOOL!

aaah,the dishonor amongst thiefs.. ;D"
,rombic,2005-03-31T02:46Z,"While this ""honor"" thing could be right or wrong ...

I'll pay respect for good games and buy them , and also pay a LOT of respect to the groups that let us ""peek"" before buying.

Personally , I think that there is more respect among us thieves than among ""consumer fools"" and ""all your money are belong to us"" companies

,japiapian,2010-09-19T12:39Z,to anyone who cant find the crack all you just gotta do is open the iso with winrar and then look for a folder called hoodlum inside there you will find the crack  called cold fear retail
,blaymoric,2010-12-11T18:50Z,"You people are fucking retard's. Mount the iso, click start, right click the drive it's mounted it (For me it's E: but it probably varies from computer to computer) then hit EXPLORE. There should be a folder called ""HOODLUM"" and there is ""ColdFear_Retail.exe"" Your crack :D geniuses...."
,shadowwolf1917,2011-02-14T08:22Z,"Great Torrent, works perfect, thanks a lot! One of my friends told me this is a great game, let us see if he is right :)."
,datian197,2011-03-13T23:28Z,pls seed
,ust2,2011-04-12T16:10Z," Whenever I start the game I get 'No Signal' from my monitor.

 I've tried multiple resolutions and hertz, different compatibility modes, the whole works, just can't seem to remedy it.

 This is of course on Win7(x86) and a generic monitor, so I think it's something on my end just not agreeing with the game.


 Other than that this seems to be a good copy, just mount/install/crack/play. 

 Will seed for the rest of the week still :)"
,ust2,2011-05-10T03:30Z," Well I just found a sollution to my problem lol (was pretty bored).

 All I had to do was goto Nivdia Control Panel and create a custom resolution with 60hz. 

 That seems to force the game into using 60hz, whereas just setting it by the regular Windows7  control panel method would not."
,Reddeamon,2011-05-17T20:14Z,"One version that downloads, Thanks."
,ladyofthedawn,2011-06-13T21:49Z,you can't safe in the game and the game doesn't save for you. So no use to play the game if you can't save. When you look in the folder Save...it say...Dummy.
,sarathmrs,2012-02-25T00:42Z,game crashes after intro movie.what to do?
,drecktpb,2012-05-17T11:21Z,"If you plan to play this with Mouse and Keyboard, don't botther downloading. It' s absolute unplayable, ( and makes you just angry ) I think its a stupid Console conversation."
,LeonSKom,2012-07-11T19:07Z,drecktpb i dont think so. game's working nicely....its may b u r using low-type hardwares in ur system..!!!
