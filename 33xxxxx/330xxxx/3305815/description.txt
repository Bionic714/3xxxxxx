OK here's a Great Pro-Shot show by the German Punk band Upright Citizens. This was filmed on their 1989 farewell tour, enjoy!

Upright Citizens-Farewell Tour Video 1989 SVCD 59m Minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.         http://www.videolan.org/
