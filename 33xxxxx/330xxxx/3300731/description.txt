Cold Fear *RETAIL*
XBOXDVD
8th march 2005
PAL

Note:

Cold.Fear.REPACK.XBOX-WAM is a beta with
debug xbe, game has been reported having
many bugs.

We bought the original to make sure that
the original was not like this, and it seems
that it was not :) props to WAM for giving 
us very nice and early titles, this is
absolutely NOT ment as any propaganda
against WAM, we like WAM and what they do.

But, as nobody seems to fix this retail
version we had to.


WAM:

Totalt files:
        109 files        2,835,125,764 byte

                         544,821,248 bigfile.bin
                         3,629,056 default.xbe

ACE:

 Totalt files
         110 files       2,837,176,164 byte

                         539,367,424 bigfile.bin
                         3,624,960 default.xbe

 The Credit.FSB is not in the WAM's music dir either,
 and the sizes of most of the files is different.

 Note: WAM's xbe is in debug mode, ACE xbe is retail.
       If you don't belive us, download both, and
       compare for yourself.
