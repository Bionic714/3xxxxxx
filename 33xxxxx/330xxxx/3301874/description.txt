This is the new edition of the Tupolev Tu-154B2 for FS2004
Yes, it is also a freeware aircraft but check the size of it!

And it is really good work as a freeware aircraft!
I would like to say this!
The Posky 767-300 V.4 and this one will be a great addition to you collection!
freeware but as good as payware!

"The version 9.4 file includes a full and free package with detailed visual model, 2D panel, working virtual cockpit and several liveries.

The panel is highly detailed with several systems modeled according to the real Tu-154. Please remember to read the manual before starting unless you're licensed to fly this bird in real life"
