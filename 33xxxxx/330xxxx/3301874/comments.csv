,Luffar-bonden,2005-06-06T10:36Z,jag har installerat den här men jag ser inte tupoleven i flight simulator kan jag göra något åt det?
,rfPolo,2005-08-02T05:41Z,"That is because your looking in the wrong place.

The Tupolev is listed under ""ANTK Tupolev"" in the manufacturer list. 
And the Boeing is under ""Project Opensky"" in the manufacturer list:)"
