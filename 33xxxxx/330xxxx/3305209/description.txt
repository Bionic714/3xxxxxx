Thwarting evil with an arsenal of high-flying attacks against a multitude 
of creatures and mechanical monsters, players control Drake Gemini in his
quest to reunite his family and become a Guardian of Dinotopia, an island 
where humans and dinosaurs coexist. While defending the island of Dinotopia from a rogue group of thugs, players navigate through 24 levels including swamps, villages, and ancient jungle ruins. When travel is prohibitive on foot, players can take to the air through desert canyons on a flying dinosaur called a Skybax, or along tropical trails atop a robotic beast 
known as a Strutter.<a href="http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/product/232978.asp" title="EB Games Info">Even More Info</a></h1></font>
