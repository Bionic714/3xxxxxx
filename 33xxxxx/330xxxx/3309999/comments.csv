NewsLeecher is a brand new Usenet downloading (leeching) application. It downloads movies, pictures, MP3 files, and software applications in a snap, and uses it's inline engine to assemble and decode all the downloads. The powerful featureset and state-of-the-art user interface makes it an application ""you simply can't live without"" if you are a serious Usenet leecher.

NewsLeecher supports a unique download system that makes it one of the absolute fastest usenet downloaders available. The combination of being able to download from multiple usenet servers at the same time, using up to 99 download threads per server, and using a sophisticated system to download file parts spread over different servers, makes NewsLeecher faster than competitors such as NewsBin, GrabIt and XNews. Try it out and make the comparison yourself. "

This is a very OLD version of Newsleecher~

The new version is 2.3--and the serial does not work (eventhough the cracker CLAIMS it will)~
