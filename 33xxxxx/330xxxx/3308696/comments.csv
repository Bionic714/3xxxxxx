If you have seen CKY and the Movie Jackass, than you know this movie will make you pee you pants. Weather it's The Cup Test, Plunger Wake up, or Snake River BMX this movie will make you laugh your a$$ off! This movie is the collection of all of the stunts from the Second Season. Great movie with great stunts and great performers to do them. Stars include Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Steve-O, Chris Pontius, Raab Himself, Rake Yohn, Wee Man(Jason Acuna), Preston Lacy, April, Phil, and Jess Margera, and Jeff Termaine. Guest appearances by Tony Hawk and Mat Hoffman. Best Jackass DVD to date!

P.S. Don't forget to take the quiz at the end of the Movie! Don't miss a question or you'll be the Jackass!

Greets!"
,heeenk,2005-04-10T19:43Z,Det finns ingen Jackass - del ett. Del 2 är del 1. Namnet är ett skämt - del 2 innebär alltså inte avsnitt 2 eller säsong 2.
