Ten years ago, some of the worst atrocities of the twentieth century took place in the central African nation of Rwanda -- yet in an era of high-speed communication and round-the-clock news, the events went almost unnoticed by the rest of the world. Over one hundred days, almost one million people were brutally murdered by their own countrymen.


In the midst of this genocide, one ordinary man, a hotel manager named Paul Rusesabagina -- inspired by his love for his family and his humanity -- summoned extraordinary courage and saved the lives of 1268 refugees by hiding them inside the Milles Collines hotel in Kigali. Hotel Rwanda is Paulâ€™s remarkable story.
