The White Sound 
tells the story of Lukas (Daniel BrÃ¼hl) who, at the age of 21, moves to the big city to study and live with his sister. The anonymity of student life, the stress of city living, romantic rejection and loneliness result in feelings of paranoia and insecurity. It is in this state of mind that Lukas experiments with psilocybin magic mushrooms. The combination triggers a psychosis. Haunted by aggressive and abusive voices, Lukas sinks into a downward spiral, which culminates in a prolonged and highly distressing psychotic episode. Eventually spurning prescribed medication, Lukas embarks on a journey in order to find some respite from the unrelenting voices which fill his head.<i>The White Sound</i> is a controversial film; its disconcerting and sometimes bleak portrayal of schizophrenia has ignited much debate since its release.	
						
				
Lukas, 21 years old, moves to the city to start life as an adult. He moves into an apartment with his sister, goes to great parties and meets cool people. But some things are amiss: he goes ballistic when he gets the time wrong for a movie, and after taking psychedelic mushrooms, he starts hearing voices and jumps out a window. Soon enough he discovers that what he thought was a drug reaction is a full-blown case of schizophrenia. Director Hans Weingartner has taken on a formidable subject for his first film. He did three years of research to make sure he got it right and the result is a touching study of one man's struggle to contain his demons. The moving performance of Daniel BrÃ¼hl as Lukas enables us to understand the wars that are waged inside one's own head. Running time: 106 minutes

   "Hans Weingartner's THE WHITE SOUND is a relentless, unflinching, and, above 
   all else, arrestingly honest depiction of a young man's descent into 
   schizophrenia. Lukas (played with brave abandon by Daniel Bruhl) is a handsome 
   21-year-old who moves to Cologne to live with his sister, Kati (Anabelle 
   Lachatte), and her pot-smoking friend, Jochen (Patrick Joswig). At first, 
   things are great, as the trio hit the town, partying to their heartsï¿½ content. 
   But after eating mushrooms in the country one afternoon, Lukas begins to hear 
   voices inside his head. His sister and Jochen blame it on the drugs, but days 
   later, when the voices get louder and more incessant, it becomes quite clear 
   that the problem lies within Lukas himself. Eventually, Lukas is diagnosed as 
   a schizophrenic, and after a stay in a mental hospital, he returns home. It 
   isn't long after he decides to stop taking his medication that the voices 
   return, sending him into an even deeper state of disturbance. Adopted by a 
   caravan of hippies, Lukas winds up in Spain, at the ocean, longing for the 
   voices to disappear forever. Using hand-held cameras and shooting on digital 
   video, Weingartner captures the horror of schizophrenia with impressive skill 
   and compassion. "

   I searched the internet for a proper synopsis in english and found it very
   very hard to get one. Maybe this movie is a bit challenging to watch when
   you have to rely on the subtitles. But I'm sure the majority of you will
   figure out what it is about.  

   When you see this movie please keep in mind that it was produced with almost
   no money. So instead of complaining about shaky camera and bad sound you 
   should think of a story yourself and make a film of it. As you can see, even
   a movie that costed less than what other productions spend on the main
   actor's "special requests" can make it to the big screen, festivals, DVD
   and even the bittorrent network.

   The Extras, including the interview with supersexy Anabelle Lachatte, had to
   go since no subs were available.


   Shout outs and greetings
