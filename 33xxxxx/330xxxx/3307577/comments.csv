Paragon Drive Backup

Protect your system and data against disasters! Drive Backup is complete and easy solution for hard disk backup, upgrade and cloning. Create complete backup of your hard disk or separate partition(s). In disaster case you will be able to quickly restore operating system with all installed and configured applications, restore valuable documents and files. Backup image contains the most complete snapshot of hard disk or partition - data files, system and hidden files, compressed and encrypted files, boot records - and after restore on either old place or a new place it immediately becomes bootable and workable. 

You can create backup image of any Windows operating system without even interrupting it - due to HotBackup technology there is no need to reboot Windows or close any application. Compressed backup image reduces space required and can be created on any desirable media - local drives including hidden partitions of different file systems (FAT16/32, NTFS, Ext2/3FS), removable media (Floppy, ZIP速, Jazz速), directly on recordable media (CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R(W), DVD+R(W)), external storage (USB, FireWire), network drives. Image can be spanned automatically for removable and recordable media as well as manually. 

Incremental Backup technology sufficiently reduces backup time by placing into backup image only modifications performed since previous backup. You can create multiple sequential incremental backups and later restore any of them. This technology becomes a breakthrough when combined with built in Drive Backup Scheduler tool. You can once schedule automated backups (either incremental or regular) and they will be performed unattended without any worries from your side. 

Restore is not any bigger task even in the worst case. Bootable RecoveryCD contains full-functional Drive Backup and even additional features for simple recovery. Even for unbootable machine you can start your computer with RecoveryCD and restore damaged system from image, backup important documents and files from any partition before complete OS reinstallation, or change damaged configuration files in-place. At any time you can also browse backup image just like any regular local drive and restore separate files and folders from it - very useful if you wish compare two versions of one document or you have only some documents damaged after virus attack. 

You can also easily clone or upgrade hard disks. Drive Backup can copy separate partition from one place to another with simultaneous changing its size, or whole hard disk to a new one with automatic adjusting sizes. New hard disk immediately becomes bootable after cloning."
