,arainc,2007-08-26T07:17Z,Great quality.  A classic of the spike lee films.  Jungle fever was also another good one.  But not as good as this one IMHO.  I've already seeded 3.0+  May continue to seed until 6.0 or greater.

Downloaded in less than an hour, the quality is amazing, sound is great, no choppiness.
Perfect download, the upload speed is slow, but that's minimal."
