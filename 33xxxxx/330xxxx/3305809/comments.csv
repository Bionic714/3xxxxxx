[T],sickboy88,2005-05-26T09:23Z,"Yeah, I actually just watched this last night.  It wasn't nearly as good as the first one, which wasn't that good to begin with."
,gyllenefras,2006-06-30T17:29Z,does this one have good quality?? ... cuz it has only got three stars... btw seed please ^^
,pluppisen,2006-09-11T09:56Z,is this the 3 movie or the second?
,mira_cle,2007-03-31T10:38Z,"Very good quailty indeed :)
Thanks!"
,disobedient,2007-11-19T00:59Z,"""does this one have good quality?? ... cuz it has only got three stars""

All sickboy releases are absolutely top-quality (check out his u/l history).  People are probably giving three stars for the movie itself, not the quality of the seed (which is the wrong way to rate, but oh well...)  Thanks, sb88!"
,elinemaria,2007-12-21T22:37Z,could someone perhaps consider to seed?? please! :):):)
