,pelle1968,2005-03-19T13:53Z,Jippi! Kurosawas rullar är alla kanon och för dyra för att köpa... Den här har jag inte sett heller.
,theanalogkid,2005-03-19T14:17Z,"Kurosawa, hurra! Om någon har Yojimbo skulle det vara superfint, har letat mycket men inte hittat någon DVDR av den."

,kumitator,2005-03-26T03:25Z,"zenzen: You say 20 ppl completed the torrent and disappeared, but my client shows that no one has completed yet. Are you sure your client is uploading data? No one has passed the 98.5% since i've been connected to this torrent (almost since day one)

Thanks again for the movie, now if only we can finish it :)"
