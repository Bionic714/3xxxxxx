,Boass,2005-03-30T06:23Z,"HomeRoom provides an easy way change users in a shared environment, like a primary school's computer lab. Instead of creating a separate user account for each student, and all the administration that requires (domains, server licenses, etc), you simply create a folder for each student on a shared network directory. HomeRoom automatically inspects the shared directory, and discovers the users. Users simply double click their name in their year group, and their Recent Files, My Documents and My Pictures are set to the shared network folder. In addition user preferences like swapping mouse buttons (for people who are left handed), and color schemes are restored. The program automatically runs when a user first logs in, and then minimizes itself into a small icon on your taskbar. Simply double click the notebook to display the window shown at the right.Then click on the year group, and double click the user. That's it!As a result, all of the users files are now saved in a single location, and you can easily back up all of the work from a single location. ."
