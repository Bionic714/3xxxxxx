Worst By Chance (Japan, 2003)

Starring: Nakashima Mika, Ikeuchi Hiroyuki

Short plot:
Picture a boy bent on self-destruction, a girl seeking despair, a man wishing to be happy, and a corps wanting to be noticed. These three distressed people and a dead body rush forward. This is a hard hitting romantic hip-hop movie, where the risks are so high they become impossible to fathom.
