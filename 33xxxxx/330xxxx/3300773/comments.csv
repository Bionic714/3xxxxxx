,Fizzz24,2005-03-12T21:49Z,"Can be viewed, but the sound track is out.  Could this be due to incomplete download?"

,Mammon2005,2005-03-28T10:59Z,No f**king sound!!!! :stupid:
,_Chambers_,2010-01-02T13:16Z,"All of the idiots who complain about sound need to stop assuming that its a faulty torrent and instead ask nicely on how they can further their own knowledge.

PROTIP: Download VLC media player and you'll save a lot of time that you would have spent moaning about not having sound."
,DVDman09,2012-02-13T04:13Z,"I use Media Player Classic and K-Lite Codec Pack, and it works fine for me.
No need to download those huge 10 or 15 GB versions to play it on your PC. Fuck that shit!"
