,glowb,2005-03-28T05:06Z,Will this only run with a proprietary video board??
,rikun,2005-04-19T09:09Z,"I assume it won't need any special video card, as the previous version didn't. Would be nice if somebody would seed, though :)"
,Nilssons,2005-05-21T23:40Z,"No dongle was found. Please connect a valid dongle to this computer to ensure proper operation.
What do I do? Whats the problem."
,Sprett1,2005-07-06T19:32Z,"The Xpress DV/Pro part of the Avid-family do not need any special hardware to work. But be advised; it might be smart to read the offical webpage for supported hardware. Avid is perhaps one of the best video editing systems, used by professionals and television stations all over the world."
,calvin_,2005-07-25T14:30Z,What do I do about the dongle problem?
,videolita,2006-01-09T13:01Z,"I also have the dongle problem, is there a way to fix it?"
,logitechsamsung,2006-08-13T20:20Z,"A dongle is a small ""USB-key"" that you put into the computer to make the program work, to prevent that people like us use the program.

Unfortunatly I don't know how to walk around this problem."
