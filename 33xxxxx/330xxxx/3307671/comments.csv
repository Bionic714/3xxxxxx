The TimeBox application is a time management tool for contractors and consulting professionals. It provides a clean, intuitive interface that allows workers to easily track the time they spend on projects. 

The application allows a variety of customized reports to be generated, as well as at-a-glance time summaries. It also features advanced editing capabilities, allowing users to edit or add current and past times. TimeBox also provides easy backup utilities to help protect data. 

Aside from its ease-of-use and low cost, what really sets this application apart is its Internet capabilities. Users can access their instance of TimeBox from any networked computer and Web browser. This allows users to track time remotely from another computer or Internet-capable PDA or cellphone. The TimeBox application is also an important part of the TimeSuite time management system. This system allows workgroups and project teams to collectively track, manage, and report on time. Workers simply track their time with their TimeBox instances, and then submit their over the Internet to a central server application. The server application can then track and report on time spent by all team members."
