Well, this cd is a real masterpiece in acoustic music. Swedish Jose Gonzales does a very fine job with this singer/songwriter production. One of the best albums in 2003, not like the ususal commercial crap the record companies spits out on a daily basis.

If you haven't heard this album before, don't miss out on this opportunity!
Very soft and moody, the kind of music you want to make out to ;)
