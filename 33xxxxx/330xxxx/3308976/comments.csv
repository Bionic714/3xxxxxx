,Norwegian_pirate,2006-09-24T16:27Z,"OMG THIS GAME SUX!

Its a fucking demo!
Its only 30 minute gameplay!
THIS SĂXXX!!! ( sucks )"
,gollof,2007-06-20T22:41Z,"Uhm, Norwegian_pirate don't you think 804MB is a bit large for only a demo?
The demos I've seen for this title are around 155MB at least. "
,fjell666,2007-08-03T00:12Z,what the fuck... people need to learn to seed... come on I wanna play this game
,juha12341234,2007-10-23T20:43Z,Have you got Chaos League: Sudden Death addon?
,juha12341234,2007-10-23T22:55Z,"Played the Sudden Death demo and its really more like a full version on Chaos League. Hope to find torrent soon, its not shipped any more. lol"
,Nocturnal007,2008-06-18T01:22Z,Waste of bandwidth and space because it doesn't work.  It exits to desktop after NVIDIA logo.
,ausfalc,2008-10-11T22:45Z,try this link if you want an installer package instead of a an image - works fine.
,1aurent,2009-01-31T15:54Z,"everything works fine except the crack puts the game in german 

a language i don't understand

help please"
,A_Creed,2009-03-23T20:39Z,"@1aurent

After installing (game + patch + crack), open the ""Chaos League"" folder and double click ""Setup.exe"". Then, select the right language (English, German, French, Russian), then ""Apply"". In my case, even if the language i wanted was rightly displayed in the ""Autorun.exe"" box, I had to define it again and ""Apply"". Then it works !"
,Topper42,2009-05-20T17:07Z,"This worked fine for me, thanks for the torrent"
,heinz09,2009-08-22T21:43Z,"Okay I read about the game on gamespot, and it rocks... The only question, since I can't get this anywhere legally and I want it, then I will resort to alternative methods, so I download this, and it works.

Just go into the setup.exe and make sure it is on English, otherwise the game keeps putting it in German.

I am running Windows7 RC with NO Nvidia drivers and mine works great, so if it doesnt work for you check your drivers.

To my final question: Where can I get the expansion torrent?"
,heinz09,2009-08-25T19:10Z,"FOUND IT! One hell of a search, but FOUND!
