All good times 3... And we keep em comming!! www.back2Bizkit.net once again brought a bootleg from The Bizkit's to your PC! This time 2 of your quick forum members decided it should be a concert from back in 1998 in Tokyo! You can be also have a say, of which the next concert should be! Enter the forums, where we will be more than gladly to help you!

When we did Seattle, i had a little problem with time! This meant that the torrent got stuck at first 20 and then 60 %... Dont worry, i'll get back, and upload everything i can for you guys, but the torrent aint going no where!

stay cool... And limp with the bizkit... or something like that!!
