,Frezzno,2005-03-16T16:25Z,"Original, then they speak english not swedish, right? Anyway, I don't mind the quality. This film is hard to find."
,Astralia,2005-03-16T16:26Z,"a real classic, luckily ive got this one on DVD :)"
,seveneleven,2005-03-16T16:39Z,Frezzno>> right :-) english speech and no subtitles.
,Frezzno,2005-03-16T17:46Z,"Thank Seveneleven. This one will do. Just enough to revive some old memories.

Astralia, if you upload an avi rip of that it would be a really nice gesture."
,Creammannen,2005-03-16T18:23Z,as i remember this movie as a kid it looked much better (lol). but this movie is so great bad its not in swedish.. or are there another version out?
,hackeyking,2005-03-18T01:20Z,Has anyone got the unanimated version?
,hellfuel,2005-03-19T10:25Z,Does ANYONE have this in Swedish?
,coeus,2005-03-25T04:09Z,"There would not be anyone out there having all of the Narnia series to put up on bittorrent? O_:-D

I cannot wait until 26th of December 2005 - when the series will come to cinemas all over the world. :D"
,zubutix,2005-06-24T00:44Z,how can you say it looked better when you were young? and whats this about some people have looked for it for 10 years? Do you not want the new version by disney? that looks awesome! check the homepage.
,MrDouglas,2005-07-17T08:51Z,"I think we looked upon this film with different (and less critical eyes) when it was broadcast on television a rather long time ago. 

I too remember it as much better animated, still great though, and great to be able to hear it with original english voices :)"
,slicer_05,2005-08-02T23:42Z,"Thanks seveneleven!

:D"
,Cineasten,2007-01-22T12:42Z,"Its been aired on Swedish tellie as late as last year (Barnkanalen/Childrens Channel). It was the swedish dub.

It has also been released on dvd in different versions. A couple american versions with american voices, at least one british version with british voices and one swedish version with new, ""actors"". The new swedish dub is absolutely awful. The old swedish dub is definitely the best.

,HIyaalll,2008-06-15T00:53Z,"To those who remembers this movie looked better.. so do I, and I am not the least unsure about it: There is another animated version of narnia.. and I would like to find it... ahh, I'll just keep on searching."
