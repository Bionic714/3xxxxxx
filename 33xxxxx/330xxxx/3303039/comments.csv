,MrMann,2005-03-17T21:40Z,"Indeed. I haven't downloaded any of your torrents yet, Assmaster, but I like the way you organize them."
,McKack,2005-03-18T21:58Z,"Thanks, I've never seen a 260MB version of this game. Does it mean this is a -really- full version or a remake with better sound/music/graphics?"
,MrMann,2005-03-18T22:51Z,"I think it's just an Enhanced CD version. According to MobyGames, it was released two years after the normal DOS version in 1995. Time for me to change the title. And according to this review the 3DO version had better cinematics:

,Corelian,2005-03-18T23:28Z,"The CD version has pre-rendered cinematics and spoken dialogue, while the floppy version had those nifty vector cinematics and text dialogue. So, if you liked the vector gfx (I did), don't throw your floppy version away just yet. IMHO the CD cinematics are quite crappy."

,SON-of-ZORQ,2008-04-25T02:39Z,Or don't. At 9MB it's clearly a ripped version (always is on abandonia) without the cutscenes or speech which is the reason for getting a CD version in the first place.
,Rathori,2008-10-10T08:05Z,Please reseed
