Back with more 80's songs, extended! Also a bonus, last track (12) Double-Captain of her heart (Instrumental). Found it from one peer on mirc, nobody on e-mule or DC++ (those who I checked, at least 50000 peers) had it!

It's very beautiful as instrumental version!

Track list made with winamp.
Hope you enjoy it.
