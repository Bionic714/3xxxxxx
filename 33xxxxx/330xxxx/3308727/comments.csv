,staD,2005-05-09T15:17Z,"It says that the dutch subtitles are optional. How do I remove the dutch subtitle? This is not a problem, but I would love to watch the movie without dutch subtitles."
,jbz,2005-05-19T12:14Z,Great quality. Thx.
,bosstanaka,2005-06-20T14:14Z,"this is a great moment to call some people noobs, in this case it's you. this guy isn't crazy, if he tells subtitles are optional, they ARE. media players like media player classic automatically load subtitle files with the same filename as the movie itself. this means u'll have to turn m off in your player. in the best player which exists, media player classic, u can do that in the play->subtitles menu or if uve got vobsub enabled, by rightclicking the vobsub icon in your taskbar and then ""hide subtitles"""
,Chimairo,2005-07-18T13:46Z,"This isn't the whole movie...
