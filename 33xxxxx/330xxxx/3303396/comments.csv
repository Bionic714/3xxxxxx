He had a very, very deep bass ringing from his throat all the time, and managed to get overtones at the same time. Rather difficult to explain, but You'll never forget the sound of it once You've heard it.

It's best percieved when it's not accompanied by other people singing or other instruments playing.

Thanks for sharing this!"
