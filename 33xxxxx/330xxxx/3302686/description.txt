It took a while but now it's finally here. A good DVDRip of Infernal Affairs 3. Unfortunately it seems to have been dubbed in some other gook language but hey, so what, 'Chinkish' as 'Chinkish', right ;-) Anyways, Eng subs can be found at http://divxstation.com/dl/subtitles/33308.srt 
Obviously you should watch the two prequels before seeing this one.
