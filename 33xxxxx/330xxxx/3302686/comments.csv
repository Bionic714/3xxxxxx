,krum,2005-03-16T23:46Z,Like your use of the word 'gook' you fucking dicksplat.
,fr33r,2005-03-17T00:41Z,"Well, I aim to please:) But 'Chink' didn't bother you?!? Dim-wit!"
,phonkyd3jv,2005-06-19T22:48Z,"""'Chinkish' as 'Chinkish', right"" dumbest thing I've heard in a while. there are people who like movies for the movie, stop uploading this crap just cause you got it, try having some quality before you go aroung spreading it around the net."
,phonkyd3jv,2005-06-19T22:58Z,"by the way, I agree with krum... if fr33r doesn't understand the difference by using words as 'chick' and the word 'gook', then I guess you don't know much. 

Zorkzero: thanks alot for the link, I really appriciate it. 

I've been trying to get a decent copy of this movie for quite some time now, and because people are sharing shit it's difficult. The [ECHiZEN] version available her on tpb was crap, the sound was totally out of sync, and this version was crap too, just as fr33r explains in the info. another copy I got from eMule had awful picture quality.... 
I hope there are seeders on this link."
