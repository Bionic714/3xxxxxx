Does it look like it got swesubs?"
,wurtsi,2005-03-11T17:12Z,.... because other ladder 49 torrent file have it.
,wurtsi,2005-03-11T17:29Z,"Finnish subs have put after into original movie. That's why root menu doesn't have finsub button.

Sorry my english ...."
,wurtsi,2005-03-15T17:53Z,"You don't have to change that only from root menu , you can change that also during the movie. Whit pressing mouse button or subtitles button from remote control."

,jawil,2005-03-18T16:49Z,I can't burn this with Nero. It says that the DVD hasn't got enough space. How do I get around this?

I have a same problem..."
,wurtsi,2005-03-23T13:14Z,Decrypt the movie with DVD Decrypter. Then it fits
,wurtsi,2005-03-24T19:12Z,Easier way is to use dvd shrink
,mephist0,2005-04-18T19:00Z,Such things should be checked before seeding the movie.. grr.. fuckups..
,wurtsi,2005-04-18T23:36Z,"No big deal to use dvd shrink. To solve problem you need to wait at most 20 minutes when shrink is decrypting the movie.

My mistake, cause movie don't fit on dvd5."
,jannu22,2006-04-11T12:05Z,seeding please!!!
