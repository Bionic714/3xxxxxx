King biscuit flower hour or on the wings of a russian foxbat (No idea why they called it that!) Last Concert in Japan (Martin Birch should be shot for that but ill forgive him) Well this is what should of been (For the whole tour!) Tommy Bolin and purple the best recording and best live performance (that has been released) (and as for last concert in japan the remastered THIS TIME AROUND album will be seeded to put that to shame) sit back and enjoy!!! Love from tad.
