    "You don't know (when it's time to write a song). You just feel the song. It comes through you. The good songs do 'cause you can write a commercial song where you have to squeeze it out, but the idea songs just happen. They're just...you're riding along sometime and you get something in your mind, and you write it down and that's an idea.

    Sometimes you get an idea from what somebody said...But you don't write it unless you feel like it...They're personal (songs), but they weren't written during the time they were personal. In other words when you have these problems you don't...the last thing you think of is writing a song about a problem. But later on you laugh at it, and then you write a song about it."
