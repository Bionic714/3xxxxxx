Active WebCam captures images up to 20 frames per second from any Video 
  Camera or USB Camera and broadcasts them either from your computer or through 
  any FTP server. Viewers can watch real video, not still images like other 
  software does.
  All you need to broadcast is a Windows compatible camera or capture device 
  with a framegrabbing driver. There is no need for a special webcam, for 
  example, you can use a standard tv-card together with a camcorder.
