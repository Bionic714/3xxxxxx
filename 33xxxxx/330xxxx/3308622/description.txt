-- The Giga Hentai Encyclopedia --
- A new era for perverted leechers -
----- Part 3


Sounds flamboyant, eh?
But let's be honest, nothing special with this collection. It's just a wee bit larger then the other ones, in some cases just 6 gigs, in some 10, depending on my need to show off.

So, apart from size, what's the difference to the original Hentai Encyclopedias ?
Easy: I didn't bother to sort them. No order apart from the alphanumerical one.
Probably many duplicates, some are of poor quality and a few won't be complete, but hey, it's more than you'll ever need to keep your hands, er, phantasy occupied.

I try to avoid seeding stuff I already released in the themed encyclopedias, but thats all.
Note: There will be no support at all! You can ask all you want but I won't send you complete version because doujin xxx is broken/incomplete/low quality or whatever! Shit happens when you go into mass-production.

When I'm done with seeding all I have you'll have access to 90 gigs of hentai mangas which should more than make up for all the less than stellar doujins in this collection.

Just take it as it comes. Enjoy !
