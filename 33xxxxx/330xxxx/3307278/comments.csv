                   AutoDWG   Attribute  Extractor  Help  you 
                   batch   extract   attribute   data   from 
                   AutoCAD  attribute blocks without need of 
                   AutoCAD.  It  supports  most  DWG formats 
                   including  AutoCAD  Release  9 through to 
                   the present AutoCAD 2002. 

                   Why    extract   attribute   information? 
                   Creating  a bill of materials immediately 
                   comes to mind. Taking attribute 
                   information  into  a  spreadsheet program 
                   such  as  Excel  allows  you to calculate 
                   valuable attribute data, sort, and so on. 

                   Extracting  attributes  has  always  been 
                   one   of  the  most  difficult  tasks  to 
                   accomplish  in  AutoCAD.  How many of you 
                   have  actually  figured out how to create 
                   the   archaic,   cryptic  template  files 
                   needed   to   extract   your  data?  This 
                   painful  process  has  become  a piece of 
                   cake with the AutoDWG Attribute 
                   Extractor.  Just  follows  the  program's 
                   wizard,  with  several  mouse clicks, you 
                   will   get   the   result  you  expected.
