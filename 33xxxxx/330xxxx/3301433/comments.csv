i lol'd. For those not familiar with .rar, it's an archive format (similar to zip) that allows for stuff to be transferred as one file. I dont know why he didnt just make a torrent with each file in it, other than he didnt want people only downloading the song they want and dropping the torrent once it's done... but that's actually a decent reason. Also, 192 is decent enough for most music. If you want 320, go buy the CD and rip it at 320.

tldnr: Get IZArc and extract the file to get your mp3s."
