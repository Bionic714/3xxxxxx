,psykopat,2005-03-30T20:07Z,"Is this realese sub better than TLF's?
Beacause those sucks!"
,FAK7OR,2005-03-30T20:25Z,OMFG!! Must have now! Been waiting for this one for so long that I actually forgot about it.
,john170950,2005-03-30T23:29Z,"Cool, I hope the sub quality is as good as the nfo indicates.
Looking forward to getting this, great up!"
,Twilight99,2005-04-01T05:46Z,"What is the source for the video? It says nothing in the nfo. Is it retail? NTSC or PAL? I beg that it is not TC. Does R2 stand for Region 2? That I don't understand, because a Region 2 release should include original English subs."
,Deleuze,2005-04-01T09:05Z,Japan is also region 2. It's source is a retail japanese dvd.
,Deleuze,2005-04-01T09:06Z,and NTSC of course.
