,Consider-Phlebas,2006-02-19T09:09Z,"Been seeding this to & from for the last half year (although I bought the DVDs anyway, they were so cheap ;-) I play with VLC and have had no problems whatsoever, so it's bound to be in your installation somewhere. (B.t.w., the last episode, the Voice is missing from this set, but can be found somewhere on Mininova.)"
