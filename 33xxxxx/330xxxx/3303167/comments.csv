,pat93,2005-05-28T14:18Z,"once installed can you upgrade the os. for example mac osx tiger? can you upgrade the hard drive to six gig without it being to complicated?

,Espionage724,2007-09-06T01:39Z,"Heres what I would do:

Download VMware here
Download Mac OS X86 here

VMware allows you to run multiple OS's within Windows

Mac OS X86 is a mac os that works with Intel CPUs

Mac OS X is a mac os that works with PowerPC's

Pear PC is a PowerPC emulator

So the Mac OS X86 will work faster then PearPC, Cherry OS, etc so yep..."
,Espionage724,2007-09-06T01:40Z,Also why buy things you can get for free? =)

,Lynth,2009-04-25T23:15Z,"I agree with Espionage724, his method is clearly better if you're looking for performance (and being able to use OS X 10.5). However, some people still need this (myself included), mainly to be able to compile stuff for PowerPC architectures rather than Intel."
