In The Sims 2 University players for the first time will play
       through the new "young adult" life stage as their Sims head off 
       to college and join the campus crowd. Whether they live in the 
       dorms or rush a fraternity or sorority that's just the beginning. 

       Sims can choose from one of 11 majors and by keeping their grades on
       track, they'll secure a final degree and open up 4 new career paths.

       Players will enjoy all-new college based wants and fears that are 
       tied to their Sims' social life and academic goals which will lead 
       to new rewards and powers that will help them achieve their goals 
       and aspirations in college and beyond.

       Pranks, parties and college social interactions add to the excitement
       while your Sims explore campus locations such as college lounges, 
       pool halls, gyms and coffee houses.

       Of course, making the right decisions can lead to your Sim to the 
       ultimate goal of becoming "Big Sim on Campus" in Sims 2 University.
