I only have Daemon Tool Lite which can mount 4 CD drives at a time. "
,Syntheticlife,2010-02-04T05:25Z,To those of you whom wonder if this torrent works or not it works just great! just unpack the files and mount disc 1 then and then mount disc 2 when told and mount disc 1 again to play

,gnome199999,2011-05-01T10:21Z,how can i seed? 
,HexTR,2011-09-04T01:59Z,"Hey guys...

It works! Just burn it...

Use Daemon Tools, before CD1, and after %67, load CD2.

Serial: R44C-HRNL-VUCT-8WAZ-U1G9

Thanks Sverra."
,joiec193,2012-02-15T05:46Z,"This actually works. First download the torrent then use Daemon Tools to install or to burn the CD.

Just a reminder that the CD is not the game itself just the installer so what you need to do is to download the patch. 

Go to http://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_the_sims_2.shtml

and download the patch . 

Although this is called NO CD patch its not actually playing without the CD. The Sims2EP1_1.mir will be extracted using rar file and mount it with Daemon Tools or burn it with CD (your choice)

Then double click the drive!!!!!!! or the Sims University. In my case it works.
