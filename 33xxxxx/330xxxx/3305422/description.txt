<p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>"The Ring 2" picks up six months after the horrifying events that terrorized Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) and her son Aidan (David Dorfman) in Seattle. To escape her haunting memories, Rachel takes Aidan and moves to the small coastal community of Astoria, Oregon, to start fresh. However, Rachel's resolve quickly turns to dread when evidence at a local crime scene - including an unmarked videotape - seems eerily familiar. Rachel realizes that the vengeful Samara is back and more determined than ever to continue her relentless cycle of terror and death.
