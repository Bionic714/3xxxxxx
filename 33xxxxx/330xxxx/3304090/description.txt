First of all: This is Championship Manager 5 - Official game from Eidos.

Here's what to do:

First of go to www.blindwrite.com and download the latest version of blindwrite.

Install this and burn the image of CM5 with everything as default, dont mess with any settings.

I installed CM5 with DeamonTools, but you problay can install it with your new burned CD as well.

But whats important is that you got Blindwrite installed on the computer you shall play CM5 on, couse without blindwrite installed it will say that you dont have the real CD inserted.

Hope this will help :D it works for me


NOCD crack (not available yet): Here is how to get around it.

When you come to load the game, press ctrl alt and delete and get rid of the uaservice.exe process, the game should load then. Worked for me which is good considering nothing else has.

Have yet to try it myself. But I have received feedback that it works!

Enjoy!
