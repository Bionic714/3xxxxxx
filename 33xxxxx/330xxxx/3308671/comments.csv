GFI Network Server Monitor is a network monitor that enables administrators to scan the network for failures or irregularities automatically. With GFI Network Server Monitor, you can identify issues and fix unexpected conditions before your users (or managers) report them to you!

Maximize network and server uptime
GFI Network Server Monitor maximizes network availability by monitoring all aspects of your Windows and Linux servers, workstations and devices (routers, etc). When a failure is detected, GFI's network monitor can alert you by email, pager or SMS, as well as taking corrective action by, for example, rebooting the machine, restarting the service or running a script.

Performs a real test, rather than deducing status from events generated by the service!
GFI Network Server Monitor actually tests the status of a service, rather than deducing a service status from generated events (as other products do), which is the only real way to ensure server uptime! GFI Network Server Monitor is easy to set up and use, and is competitively priced. >>

,Feanor48,2007-08-03T16:09Z,Teacher. Thanks for putting this up. I'll try installing it this weekend and see how it looks. I've been running IPSentry for years and while it works I thought I'd try something else just for kicks. I try to circle back with results.
