,tangled,2005-04-01T13:39Z,Tidernas bästa film! Ladda hem den! Köp den på dvd! Se den!
,susan25,2005-04-01T14:55Z,"One of the best films in mans known history,-you`re a darling!"
,pryll,2005-04-02T00:06Z,sickboy. this is the second of your rips that I have downloaded and both have had unsynced audio/video. waste of time.
,susan25,2005-04-02T01:00Z,"I Hope thats not true ! -I `m not through downloading yet,-but if it`s out of sync I`ill come and spank your ass !"
,pryll,2005-04-02T01:20Z,"sus. if your download is ok, let me know. thanx."
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-02T04:50Z,"If the audio isn't matching the lips, you have a piece of shit computer, or don't know what the fuck you are doing.

I play everything back on 3 different systems before letting it loose into the wild.  The lowest system is a athlon 700.

On a 700, the movie will look out of sync, ONLY IF you're a fucking idiot, trying to run it with all of the pre-processing options enabled.

""Bad Taste"" is a milisecond off, and it's a KNOWN issue with the dvd, it has nothing to do with my encoding.

Did you install the new XviD codec and enable ""Compatability Mode"" before bitching?  Probably not.
"
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-02T07:10Z,"What? No one else has anymore stupid shit to say? Fuck, come on. THOUSANDS of downloads, and only one complaint, and you question if the movie works?  Fuck you. Bunch of jews."
,pryll,2005-04-02T07:45Z,"dear sicko. the movie is fine, I made a mistake. sorry I hurt your feeling. take care and stay on medication."
[T],sickboy88,2005-04-02T08:46Z,So what was the issue causing the audio to unsync?
,susan25,2005-04-02T16:17Z,"Works fine, Sickboy ! :-)"
,tommedw,2005-04-08T15:33Z,Great Movie... The Cat Stevens music is really great too!
,disobedient,2005-05-10T04:50Z,Audio/Video sync works fine.  Whiners need to RTFM and install the latest codecs.
,BabeB,2005-06-09T10:40Z,"I love this flick! Thank you so much for upping it here! I haven't seen it in so long and have never seen it on a tracker. :)
Peace to you!

,giolgaudaniel,2008-08-11T00:52Z,thank you sickboy88. Very good rip. I think everybody should thank the uploader for the work he's doing for us. If it's something wrong with the movie just write down to the comments but don't criticize the uploader cause he isn't paid for what he's doing.
,raheesen,2008-08-15T20:26Z,"thanks,good quality..great movie..."
,looniam,2009-01-03T04:40Z,thank you.
,xxmiyuxx,2009-11-05T01:59Z,"seeders? Oh noz SEEDERS! =(

Please? "
,Nny777,2009-12-04T06:46Z,Is it so terribly difficult to play filmes using VLC or mplayerclassic?  Sheesh.  They have audio and subtitle sync options with the flick of a button.
,bigrich2007,2010-02-21T05:39Z,GR8T flick ! Thanks.
,Lord-Darkstorn,2010-04-28T06:16Z,Great film. And Cat Stevens' soundtrack is sublime!
,Yenrock7,2010-07-27T15:52Z,I agree to giolgaudaniel. We're getitng this for free and the uploader is NOT paid to upload this and listen to us brag.
,kirtanaya,2010-08-10T08:34Z,"Great work sickboy88 thanxxx!   Works fine.  As for the pryll ""out-of-sync"" comment.:  I've had that problem with other movies running on (Mac OS X) Quicktime, in which case I use VLC app and they run perfectly. "

,nikita566,2012-03-19T21:37Z,"Thanks....For only 18 seeders, amazing speed. Cool! I will seed as well. Thanks again."

,jayarr1,2012-08-29T07:48Z,"Wait a minute, I am as happy as the next guy that this movie was uploaded, but is NO ONE else upset that he immediately resorts to anti-Semitism?

That just pissed me right off. And no one comes to the rescue of the Jews. OF COURSE. 

Be polite. Jews aren't talking shit about you. "
