,kurz,2005-03-16T13:39Z,I can't say I like the fact that it is exe-files!! We're not living in the 1990's you know... Exe-files are creepy.
,Sarre,2005-03-16T13:44Z,"I've already explained that you can use unrar/winrar/whatever instead of running the files, so I don't see the big deal.

I repeat, running the self-extractor is up to you -- there's a choice."
,Sarre,2005-03-16T13:47Z,"... or to state it another way; for each and every person who is smart enough to not run binaries of unknown origin, theres TEN who'll go ""what's RAR?!""."

,Sarre,2005-03-21T12:45Z,"If you feel that way, give it a vote."

,Sarre,2006-01-09T18:18Z,"Yes. I'm trying to upload the 2005 series, but I'm getting ""We're experiencing some issues with the database. Please try again soon."" over and over and over again."
