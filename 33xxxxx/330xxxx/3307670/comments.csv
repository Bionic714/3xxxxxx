Will you people get your head out of your ass and start actually spreading the word?

Most people who would like to know alternatives to windows are discouraged by comments like: ""if you don't know what it is, you probably don't want it.""

Try to be forthcoming, it might be that many more would convert to linux if there was some more help in the community.

Yes, I know that you help, but mainly it's help for people already in the loop.

I'm a noob, no questions asked, and I'd like to know what this download does, so that I know if it's something I want to try on my newly installed linux machine..."
