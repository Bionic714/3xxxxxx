This is a music video for Nico's debut single,
"I'm not sayin'" (released on Immediate
1965/08/20), it's a lovely song.

I found this on Soulseek a while ago, the picture
quality's OK for such an old video.
The sound is a bit unsynchronized and low-quality.

It's the only Nico video I've ever seen and I
consider it definetely worth downloading.
Rejoice!

From the CD liner notes of Nico's "The marble index"
(from 1968 -will shortly be available here):Â¨

"...A few weeks later she was on Ready, Steady, Go,
British TV's Friday night mod-scene showcase, promoting
her first single. A folk-rock version of a Gordon
Lightfoot tune, I'm Not Saying was produced by Andrew
Loog Oldham, the Rolling Stones' manager, for his own
Immediate label, and featured Jimmy Page on guitar."
(Richard Williams)

I don't know if this video has anything to do with the
TV show, though.
