"The source of the Guardian World's power is the Throne of Yord, and Neutralizers are avowed to protect it. So, when it's stolen, Tiara and her partner Japolo - a fiesty talking ferret - set out to recover it. Simple enough, right? But tensions arise when Tiara discovers that her fellow Neutralizer, Lena, is working against her and that her friend Sara is somehow the source of the problem."
