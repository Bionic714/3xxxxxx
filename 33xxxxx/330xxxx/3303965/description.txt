OK here's another Joe Strummer show this time from Italian TV. This comes courtesy of powow who was kind enough to send the tape up. This is from 1999 and i'm sure you will all enjoy it!

Joe Strummer-Bologna Italy 4th September 1999 SVCD 49m Minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.         http://www.videolan.org/
