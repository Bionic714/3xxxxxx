,VickeBeef,2006-07-29T22:40Z,does this game works in Windows XP ??
,TurboF,2007-04-13T05:32Z,"Works fine in Windows XP, don't try to install, just make a folder called FCOP_CD or something on your HDD somewhere, and copy the game folders(FCopLAPD, MISSIONS and Video) from the cd into it. You may have to turn off ""hide hidden files and folders"" or whatever to be able to see the folders on the CD."
,TurboF,2007-04-13T05:33Z,"Also, it seems to crash in the Win95/98 compat modes, so if any compat mode is needed try Win2000"
,Langedal,2007-07-14T10:41Z,"How to make it work ?
