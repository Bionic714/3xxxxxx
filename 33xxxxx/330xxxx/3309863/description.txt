Game Information
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Found the game (CloneCD format in RAR Archive) on the eDonkey P2P Network with luck. Tested on Windows XP Home Edition and everything works; used Daemon-Tools to mount the CD Image. [Alt]+[TAB] (Multi-Tasking) doesn't work too well with the game. Installation is pretty standard. And you can play one-on-one with an AI or with a friend. TCP/IP is one way to connect in Multiplayer. Gamepads/Joysticks work with this game too. Game controls are in-game, you can find it in the Preferences section then the Controller Configuration section.  More info in the AGC-readme_(fclapd).txt file.

The Torrent comes with a NoCD crack and Glide update patch.
