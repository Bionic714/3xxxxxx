[T],FaeGiN,2008-06-25T06:00Z,"I just can't believe the old fucker is dead.  I doubt he'll rest in peace...he always said you become a pile of dust and then no one gives a fuck about you.  Well he was right and wrong.  Loads of people give a fuck.  His memory will live on forever.
Fucking hell what a sad day."
