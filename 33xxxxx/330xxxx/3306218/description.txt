Nästan Exakt samma som förra Mashed.

-Nya Bilar
-Lite Nya Effekter
-Extremt 4-spelarläge (bästa 4-spelar racing-spelet till Xbox i min mening)</b></font>

In case you need reminding and/or were living on Mars last year, Mashed was a top down racing game that pits up to four players against each other in a gladiatorial racing battle extravaganza. Mashed: Fully Loaded steps the Mashed experience up a gear, taking everything that is good and great from the original game and packing it with Fully Loaded extras, bringing players a whole new experience in top-down, multiplayer mayhem.

Mashed: Fully Loaded boasts extra tracks, more environment variations, more cars to race in, new improved handling, training modes, more single player challenges, new tournaments and a host of other in game improvements.
