I really recommend to watch the Cowboy Bebob series if you want to enjoy this movie:
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0213338/"

,Killer Of Newbs,2005-07-25T11:25Z,hunppa what are you talking about? I have never seen the series but this movie still rocks!

,Observer2300,2007-09-14T15:15Z,"This movie rules all anime! The series are even better... Wish i knew the director, id give him a million $ just to make a season 2..."
,lifted_man,2007-12-05T17:51Z,i just finished Downloading this. Its great quality and plays fine on my DIVx player. But when i put it onto a DVD. It shows up backwards. Any solutions? I want to help seed but i need to fix this.. 
,oO)b,2008-02-21T04:14Z,"damnit to the fuck TT
misread it and thought is was ENGLISH SUBS..
well fuck it, ill seed and stuff nice up btw ^^
quality wasnt as bad as i thought with the small resolution"
,oO)b,2008-02-21T06:29Z,"I'll take back my ""fucks"" and whatnot the english dubs are really good! ^^"
,afro007wtz,2008-03-01T22:41Z,"Yeah... As always, Spike get hurt but he survived, Ed hack everything, Faye is stupid and charming, Jet. is worried about all of them... On the first view everything is as it should be... But...
For the peoples which haven't seen the series, it should be explained better how Spike has lost his girl. His long and exciting ""war"" with his own past was completely forgoten. That was missing (in my  opinion)."

,psphackerowned,2009-03-23T18:27Z,ive seen the whole series but why be a ass and say spike dies
,psphackerowned,2009-03-23T18:27Z,"i love Cowboy Bebop 
thanks for the movie"
,skwisgarr,2009-08-15T07:17Z,anyone looking for the subbed version instead can find it has been released by [KAA] although cowboy bebops english dubs are some of the most tolerable of any anime series I've watched
,Dmag9,2010-01-17T15:51Z,"e0r writes, ""please dont leave spoilers for a movie people may have not seen yet. now i already know spike lives and i havent even seen it yet, thanks a lot jackass."" 


Chronologically this movie is set between episodes 23 and 24 of the series so there's no need to worry about anyone dying. Great series."
,yernavor,2010-01-28T03:41Z,saw this on HBO. . .now i have a copy. Thanks to you! more anime movies next time!
,NewLogic87,2010-03-08T05:45Z,"Thanks uploader.

If you like Cowboy Bebop check out Samurai Champloo - it's directed by the same guy and is equally awesome."
,Darkheart07,2010-05-10T17:13Z,Thanks uploader. The quality is good (for me atleast). I've been looking for the .avi file of this movie and I found it here. Thanks again.
