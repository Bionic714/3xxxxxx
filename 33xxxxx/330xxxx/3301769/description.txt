Dubbed soundtracks have been removed.
If you don't understand english and are too lazy to read the subs... well, thats not my problem...

I get a lot of requests to reseed DVD's. Especially SE1 and SE2.
I will NOT reseed any of those DVD's. 
In fact, i will not reseed anything more than 6 DVD's back from my latest release.
Exception is if you give me 1GBit upload and a couple of TB in harddrives... ;)

Ask on the forum if anyone would be kind enough to reseed.
Seeing that in less than 24 hours there are over 100 ppl leeching my releases, i get quite surprised when they suddenly die because theres no one seeding them... :-/
Hopefully at least one of the ppl who has leeched the DVD's, did actually save the movie after watching it, and can reseed....

And to the few heroes out there - helping to keep my torrents alive (you know who you are ;) ) - Thank you! :D
