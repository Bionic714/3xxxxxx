,DogshitTaco,2005-03-15T05:58Z,"I have no scanner.
Isn't there any sites with DVD-covers? I know there is for cd's..."
,dnrtllr,2005-03-15T11:51Z,BIG THANKS to dogshitTaco for the next season.
,dogshu,2005-03-16T01:24Z,"I hate to be a dick... but could you start using a different program for generating .torrent files?  It really sucks to have to use one or two specific bit-torrent clients, which only run on some OSes, or require a bleeding edge version of java.  It seems like .torrent files should at least be compatable with the original bittorrent.com client (which is written by the guy who wrote the bittorrent protocol)."
,DogshitTaco,2005-03-16T06:41Z,"I use BitComets built in .torrent creator.
Just press create and choose what folder to base the .torrent on.
If you have anything that is equally easy, go ahead and suggest it...
Can't promise anything though. 

I do burn every release(in Nero) and watch it before i put it up. Just to be sure that it works. "

,dogshu,2005-03-16T23:45Z,"Here's instructions on creating a torrent with Azureus, it looks easy enough:

Or if you don't want to deal with Azureus you can try Maketorrent:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/burst/maketorrent-2.1.exe?download

Here's instructions on using Maketorrent:

I just e-mailed the BitComet guy about the problem, hopefully he'll released a bugfixed version sometime soon.

Anyway, thanks for all the Star Trek stuff!"
