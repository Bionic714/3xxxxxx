,mytot,2005-03-21T16:53Z,Any subtitles...?? And what languages if so?
,jasey,2005-03-21T17:14Z,This is the latest version of the movie.  It has optional english subtitles.  The movie is in english.  Widescreen.
,CsMbI,2005-03-29T13:50Z,"Well, it turned out bad. About 90 users hanging out there, each having only 84% of the movie. Not a single whole copy is available.
Any chance to finish it?
If not, please let us now so we don't hang out there waiting for nothing.
If yes, please let us now what is the timeframe. Within next month's limit? :-)
Thanks for the upload in any case.

If You have a choice, do not ever choose a service provider that limits up/download amounts."
