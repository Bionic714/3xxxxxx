,Play69Boy,2006-07-03T17:05Z,"can anyone seed??  please 
it stopped at 99%"
,wolf_13,2006-09-08T18:09Z,"every time i download this game it stops at 99%,why?"
,wolf_13,2007-01-31T21:50Z,"it stops at 99%,why?"
,atarigamer,2007-12-03T18:01Z,"It stops at 99% because no one is seeding. What happens is that when people finish the download, they don't seed. With no seeders, the leechers share between themselves and total up to a certain percent. Since everyone is stuck, they go to the comments and spam ""SEED PLZ"".

I'm stuck at 98.7%. I'd be at 99% if *you* were sharing."
,atarigamer,2007-12-03T18:08Z,"..and then when someone *does* seed and that user finishes the download, *they* don't seed and everyone gets stuck again."
