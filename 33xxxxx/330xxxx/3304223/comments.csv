,trollet-ost,2006-05-30T14:01Z,Everything is not translated yet but if you realy want to read more you should learn how to use irc and first go to #thehellsingproject@irc.rizon.net and then on to #maximumt@irc.irchighway.net there you will find hellsing volume 1 to the fifth chapter in volume 9 at this url http://www.narutofan.com/plus/manga/series/hellsing.html you can get up to chapter 48 (not sure if this site is reliable) I think there are 18 volumes or something like that.
