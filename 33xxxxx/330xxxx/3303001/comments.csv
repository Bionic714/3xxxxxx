,Faeriedragon,2005-03-18T18:06Z,It would be great if someone could seed this... 
,Bhall,2005-03-20T22:30Z,Isn't there a better way for you to seed then to everyone at once?
,LastStand,2005-03-21T23:56Z,O thxs for the torrent by the way. :)  Very hard to get at this time on bittorrent in english.
,fantated,2005-03-22T10:54Z,"94.4%!!!!!!
We need a seeder. Just one to start the sharing. Share!"
,maxspark21,2005-03-22T15:41Z,"^^^ have you actually been reading the previous comments?

Guessing by the progress 100% will be reached in 10 or 12 hours. Should be worth the wait though :)

Thanks for the torrent! "
,typhaeus,2005-03-22T18:51Z,Noo Seeder *crying*
,Brightbrute,2005-03-24T04:49Z,"Hmm... I am having trouble with the installer. It runs fine until it asks for the second disk, i put it in using daemon tools, and then it says something about ""corrupted data3 file, complie error"" or such. This has happened 3 times and im not sure what to do to fix it. Anyone else having this problem?"
,Zyanid,2005-07-26T16:56Z,Is this game anything like fallout/baldursgate or arcanum? 
,boogerup,2006-05-15T13:46Z,"Zyanid: yes, with turn-based combat that's more like Fallout (which I think is much better)."

Go to your local Wal*Mart and fork out the $10 for it."
,FalseAccount,2008-08-02T19:32Z,Having some trouble. I have the game installed but whenever I try to play it I get a pop up telling me to insert the correct disk. No matter witch one I mount I get the same message.
,ajhslo,2008-09-15T19:10Z,This is the 1st game I've gotten online & I'm so confused!!! How do I install it?

,JenxRodwell,2009-04-15T10:09Z,"I'm having a bit of a problem - Looting corpses in the game doesn't seem to work too well and only happens once in a while. I read that one of the patches is supposed to fix this, bu when I install the patch (from this torrent) I can't start the game because it keeps asking me to put in the right CD. And when I put back the crack that's on CD 2 it doesn't allow me to loot corpses. So how the fuck do I fix this?"
,JenxRodwell,2009-04-15T10:16Z,Ah also when I tried to summon a fungi with the figurine the game bugged out and kicked me back into Windows.
