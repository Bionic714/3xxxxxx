Review of Luc Besson's film Le Grand Bleu/The Big Blue


  Magic and mystery infuse the narrative of this wonderful yet tragic tale of
love and friendship, of hope and despair, of life and death. It is an
unforgettable journey in the estranged mind of an unusual human being, Jacques,
whose obsessive fascination with the sea and strong connection with dolphins
prevent him from leading a 'normal' life on earth. The irruption in his secluded
aquatic life of an old childhood nemesis and of a passionate woman subjects him
to strong emotional conflicts as he feels unable to belong in the human world.


  The story investigates the self-sacrificial nature of genuine love and the
destructive potential of men's rivalry. Other themes explored in the film are
the relationship between humans and nature, the feelings of frustration and
alienation experienced by certain people who feel unable to fit in society, the
misunderstandings as well as the conflictual needs and expectations of lovers.


  The haunting images of the majestic deep blue sea and the wonderful music are
close to aesthetic perfection. The viewer is allowed to sink both in the ocean
and in the minds of the three main characters, thus sharing all their thoughts
and emotions.
