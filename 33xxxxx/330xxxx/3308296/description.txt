Remarks:
The torrent is made with BitComet, so some can of you may experience difficulties. I have yet to find anything better than BitComet to create them in. MakeTorrent2 is crap. On the last release it said it had finnished creating the torrent when it reached 99.1%, and i couldn't start the seeding... :-/
