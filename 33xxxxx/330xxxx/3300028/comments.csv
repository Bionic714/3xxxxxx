""Extra are only a short how they made I, Robot. so it didn't affect the bitrate much.""

,an2ny79,2006-10-09T09:24Z,"I don't know why I couldn't burn this to DVD.  I converted img to ISO and even extracted files from img format and use DVD Shrink to recompile.  I could watch it using computer (ISO file) but when I burned it to DVD disc (roxio and alcohol 120%), my DVD player and even my computer couldn't read the format.  I have 2 DVD burners, different kind of blank DVDs..."

,SiljeMarie,2008-05-12T16:07Z,"Ah got it now. Could play them all off in VLC.


For those who need help with it just download VLC Media Player. Open it go to Quick Open File,find the movie and mark all of the link in this movie and right click play. I had some audio problem,but you dont notice it that much. Tho you will notice when the files changes."
