Unfortunately not one of Haydn's most well-known works, but in my opinion one of his best. A very multifaceted mass, with joy, anxiety, hope and melancholy, and of course a bit humor (we mustn't forget it's Haydn :)

Preformed by the Hungarian Radio and Television Chorus and the Nicolaus Esterhazy Sinfonia orchestra.
