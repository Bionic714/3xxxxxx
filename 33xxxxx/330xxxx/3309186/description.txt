OK here is a repost of the very first Punk TV for all those who might have missed it first time round. I will repost a couple every week so i can still post new stuff as well. If anyone wants to help seed please do and that will help me to post new stuff quicker. Remember this is in VCD and not SVCD, but you get 80 mins so thats a plus, anyway i hope you enjoy them and please burn copies and give them to your friends.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy.
