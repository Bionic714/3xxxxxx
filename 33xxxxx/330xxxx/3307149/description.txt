Release Notes:

Melanie C is back with her first collection of new material in 2 years.
‘Beautiful Intentions’ was produced by Greg Haver whose credits include 
The Manic Street Preachers, Super Furry Anim
als and Catatonia.

‘Beautiful Intentions’, released on her very own label, Red Girl Records, 
is a labour of love for Melanie and a rich testament to her personal and 
artistic determination and talent. Developed over a period of nine months 
with a group of musicians Melanie has toured with extensively over a number 
of years, the album has a remarkable live energy and cohesion, directly 
arising out of the camaraderie that exists between them. Filled with anthemic
rockers and rousing but also personal ballads.
Before the album was completed, Melanie took it on the road, fine tuning the 
songs and developing the rockier edge to her sound.

Melanie co-wrote 11 of the 12 tracks on the album. All of the tracks are very

personal to Melanie and tell a story, but not necessarily the one you might 
expect. Filled with passion and willingness to experiment with genre and 
characterised by a distinctive and expressive voice……Beautiful Intentions.
