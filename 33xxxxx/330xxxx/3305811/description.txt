To play, use <a href=http://www.stepmania.com>Stepmania</a>, a Dance Dance Revolution simulation game for Win, Mac, and Linux.

"This is a compilation of the best keyboard simfiles I have ever played. If you want to make simfiles, use these simfiles as a reference point to the quality you should try to have. If you want to hold a Stepmania tourney, use this keyboard pack. This is the most professional grade keyboard "mix" you will ever find. Before any of you say how the song is offsync for you, that's normal. The syncing of songs varies from PC to PC, and it's common for DWIs to be out of sync on other PCs. I have tested this theory as I have played lots of popular originals on a multitude of PCs.

If your DWIs are offsync, you can either use the autosync with the Fkeys, or you can use auto adjust + little mode + judge 6, and just sync it to the beats.
