,mocla,2005-03-19T19:43Z,"The .torrents are saved in the lucinda install folder under ""My Torrents""."
,Shute,2005-03-20T01:56Z,"I tried it out some more and I must say it's really cool!

Thoughts:

*That teal color is NOT ok! Please, I thought girls had better taste! :)

*It would be nice if you could run the program in full screen.

*It would be more smooth if you could open the torrent directly without haviong to go to the folder and starting it.

*Language problems, mine is in french.

*If you keep the cursor above the different buttons maybe you should see what they mean? Alternatively you could name all buttons with small labels under them. Not a big problem though, doesn't really matter.

Otherwise, VERY nice idea!"
