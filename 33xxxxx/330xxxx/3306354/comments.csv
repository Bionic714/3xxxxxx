,Knievel,2005-08-15T23:49Z,"How is the sound quality on these recordings? Are they all sbd, or is it aud??
Btw, why put ambient on top of Phish???"
,vidarroark,2006-01-02T23:28Z,"Thanks for the FLAC plugin info adamina.
The quality should be good. The FLAC website (http://flac.sourceforge.net/) has a lot of info, including a free plugin download."
,RonCronDon,2008-05-01T04:03Z,Props to whoever posted this in FLAC!!  Good things come to those who wait.  Anyone not familiar with .flac files all I have to say is it takes a second or two to learn the software but once you do the difference in sound quality is worth it IMHO.
