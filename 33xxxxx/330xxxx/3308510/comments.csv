Keep it up! :)

,smokesogood,2005-04-10T13:30Z,"Many thanks for this and the other episodes.   Picture quality is very good but I can't get the audio.   Anyone else had this problem?   Please advise, my kids are going crazy to watch these again."
,k3ik0,2005-04-10T13:49Z,"Codec name:
0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3

Bitrate:
192 kb/s (96/ch, stereo) VB

48000 Hz

Only odd thing is the Hz, might be issues with that if your audiocard is configured for 44100 Hz, but shouldn't be... Get the Fraunhofer MP3-codec, and I think you should be allright. Or configure your audiocard for 48000 Hz."
,smokesogood,2005-04-10T19:30Z,Sorted.   Burned to DVD.   Everybody happy.   Many thanks once again for an excellent upload.
,antipopular,2006-05-03T17:26Z,what is the video codec on this? I can't seem to get it to work...
