thx xspoon, for this upload. I'm a big
fan of house classics period 88 - 94."
,swedishboy,2006-02-03T22:45Z,poor sound quality... sounds like it's been re-encoded...
,xspoon,2006-06-03T11:06Z,"this is captured from a webcast @256 kbps
I think it has been EQ'd and compressed to enhance the 'feeling' of bass and low medium.
My opinion is that it sounds great with headphones.
I think this is perfect for a making your own playlist in a portable player, ipod etc.."
