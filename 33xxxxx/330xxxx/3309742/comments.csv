,senseitoday,2007-10-11T17:03Z,"Ask and it shall be given?  Were you waiting for me to download the torrent?  Or did the system just hook me up automatically?  Either way, any way, it's a great series.  Thank you in advance."

,senseitoday,2007-10-16T09:48Z,"So sad...I'm gone...looking through my 84.5%...sometimes there's sound, sometimes there's picture...sometimes there's both...sometimes there's neither."
