,superfido,2005-03-22T20:26Z,"Its about time Morcheeba made a good album again.  If you like or have liked these guys download this.
  After the last few disappointments (like big calm) the jazzy and trip pop sound we liked them for in their first album has found its way back into their agenda.
     There is also an occasional new gospel element in some of the songs which ads an interesting spice  They still sound undoubtedly like morcheeba but have developed a somewhat different, and in my opinion(whatever that is worth) fuller, more skillful sound.
     It sounds like they took their time for this album and found some creativity and developed new ideas instead of pumping out another below par project.

very enjoyable.    Take care all   s-fido"
