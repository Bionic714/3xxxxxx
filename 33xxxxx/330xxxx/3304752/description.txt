First off, these were not encoded by me, they were found on eMule and were encoded by XTCrefugee.  They are DVD Rips encoded in Xvid with 640x480 resolution and MP3 sound.  Not that there are no episodes 6 and 14, as they are combined with 5 and 13 respectively.  There's no promises when season 2 will be up, as I haven't started downloading them yet, but maybe within a week hopefully.
