Thanx"
,Martin78,2005-03-16T15:40Z,"Did you left Dolby Digital AND DTS Sound?

If yes, what bitrate has the movie?

And for your information, there's also a ""Premium Edition"" with 2 DVDs out in Germany.

BTW: The DVD is already rentable from video stores (that's why I watch this great movie NOW ;-)"
,DarkMoon,2005-03-16T16:37Z,Finns det NÅN möjlighet att få den här med svensk sub så skulle i alla fall jag bli överlycklig. Min skoltyska är inte den bästa tyvärr    :-)
,jdaniels,2005-03-16T17:17Z,Längtar efter denna med swesub.
,Flammenfaust,2005-03-16T17:19Z,"If this is real you rock...
I have  the screener in german with  swedish subs 
I have looked everywhere for german subs 
try http://www.subtitles.de/  for info on subbing they may be able to help and they have the english subtitle files  "
,Flammenfaust,2005-03-16T17:21Z,also   is this PAL or NTSC ?    it doesnt really matter   cause i can use IFOedit  to fix it but NTSC works better  for  me  
,OldFart,2005-03-16T18:59Z,"If this is the same release I have with DD5.1 and DTS5.1 audios, full extras and menus then be warned: Video quality really sucks, average bitrate is 1800 kbps! Total mosaic!"
,Martin78,2005-03-16T19:02Z,obviously PAL
,duantcedric,2005-03-16T19:34Z,please post the complete DVD9 instead of releasing crappy releases !!!
,timtin,2005-03-16T19:36Z,"Eller så hämtar man ner versionen med swesub:

,smashie,2005-03-16T19:43Z,"Stop BITCHING about BITRATE on the Extras-VOB. If U can do a better job, DO IT! Why didn't U seed it?"
,nighthowler,2005-03-16T20:59Z,"this looks wierd... topic says dts but the info says ac3?
and a 156 min long movie (according to imdb) at a bitrate of 8000 fps + extras (that also takes some space) on a singlelayer dvd-r?"
,Martin78,2005-03-16T21:05Z,"Ok, I tried it myself. All Extras with minimum bitrate and the movie with DolbyDigital Sound.

Picture Quality is really bad, but on the original dvd dark scenes are also not the best quality although 8 MBit ...

And there is definitely no chance for a bitrate of 8 Mbit or so on a DVDr

If anyone is interested in the FULL DVD, I could share it."
,OldFart,2005-03-16T22:45Z,"I'm not BITCHING about bitrate, I just tell the facts. I checked the bitrate myself with Bitrate Viewer 1.5.054 from the first 1 GB VOB-file and that gave me that 1800 kbps average.
And some maths assuming that video has 8000 kbps bitrate and movie is 156 minutes:

156 min * 60 s * 8000 kbps * 1024 = 76677120000 = 7.67 GB

If someone can release a full unraped rip, please do so!"
,babb0,2005-03-16T23:11Z,"Yeah, would really appreciate the real DVD-source. Unraped and untouched."
,smashie,2005-03-17T03:41Z,"I guess the UP deserved the ONE star, at least.."
,lihard,2005-03-17T23:15Z,"I'm trying not to bitch about this so here's some help for your next releases smashie. If the movie is this long DONT leave the dts sound and use atleast 4gb for the movie alone. 
And for anybody else here we'd really like a movie only rip of this or the original dvd9."
