,woah,2005-04-24T01:48Z,help! i have downloaded this but unsure how to install as all the files are in rar format?? Please help me
,DnSx,2005-05-16T00:04Z,"Use the program winrar.

Do you often download stuff?"
,amee_c_amee,2005-06-25T02:41Z,"Hi, All are .rar files. How can I install matlab 7? Could you please explain me in detail? Thanks in advance.
Amee"
,DnSx,2005-06-28T18:29Z,"Firsxt you must have the program winrar (or something that can handle rar-files).

Open the cd1 folder and choose ""rorm701a.rar""
right-click and choose ""unrar here"" or something like that.

Then the first cd will be unpacked.
Do the same in cd2 with rorm701b.rar
and in cd3 with rorm701c.rar

Now you can either burn the three cd's or mount them with ""alcohol 120%"" or ""daemon-tools""

When you have done this, run the first cd and run the installation."

,theSquiggly,2005-07-20T14:59Z,"Hey! Nice =) thx
One prob. thou': After installing (works perfectly), MATLAB runs fine, but after restarting my PC, the processes MATLAB.exe and matlabserver.ex are already running, making it impossible to start MATLAB (it's already running...but not possible to access, and the processes are impossible to kill from WinTaskManager). 
Any helpful suggestions are very much appreciated!! =)"
,theSquiggly,2005-07-20T15:26Z,"Woa! 
First: Sorry for the multiple-posting (dumb firefox refresh-button :p)
Second: Managed to disable the matlabserver.exe service from within Settings-> CtrlPanel-> AdminTools-> Comp.Management, and now MATLAB works fine... =) atleast until I restart my Dragon again... ;)"

,coltrane1825,2010-07-03T03:41Z,I also have Windows 7. The installation went fine but I get a cascade of java errors when I try to start the program/ Any suggestions? I wonder if anyone with a successful install has Win 7? Thanks.
,nikaroni,2010-08-25T17:07Z,"if anyone is having problems in WINDOWS 7:

after you install you get a crapton of java errors. all you have to do is change your theme to windows classic (instead of aero) and everything runs fine. looks like crap, but you can always revert back after you close the program.

INSTALLATION tips:
when you get the 3 CD folders all you have to do is extact the rar file somewhere and then mount that .bin image to a program (daemon, alcohol, etc) and it'll install. when it asks for the next CD all you do is extract the next rar file and mount it in the same way. very easy. 

KEYGEN is listed in a link in an earlier comment so go look for it.
