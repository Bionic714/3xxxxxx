      Brothers in Arms is the most realistic and authentic WWII shooter 
      ever. While other WWII games have sugarcoated the war experience, 
      Brothers in Arms is based on a true story and will immerse gamers 
      into the gritty, uncensored and emotionally-charged side of war.

      you balance their lives with the success of the mission. The true 
      stories and historical events you experience on your perilous 
      journey take you through real battlefields meticulously 
      recreated from aerial reconnaissance images, US Army Signal 
      Corps photos and eye-witness accounts of war-torn Normandy. 
      Players of all skill levels can battle their way through 
      this intense experience because of Brothers in Arms innovative 
      and accessible command and control system.
