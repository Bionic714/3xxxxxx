I had to scrap the other torrent because it didn't want to start uploading... 
This one is made with BitComet instead of MakeTorrent2.

Dubbed soundtracks have been removed to increase video quality. 

Remarks: 
I had some trouble with this one because the original was damaged. There is a little distortion where the damage was, but i could still see the whole DVD. 
Sorry, but it is the best i could do...
