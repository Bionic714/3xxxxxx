,Hypnotist,2005-03-27T00:38Z,How was it?     You get the feeling in the Quest For Excellence that they're programming you to do a job for them at the end of the summer :)
,PutBoy,2005-04-15T21:46Z,"E detta bara typ självhypnos?

Får tanka. Låter kewlt! :D"

,supersmithy,2005-06-03T17:13Z,looks like it could be interesting! thanks!
,SoUMoN,2005-06-22T11:55Z,"hypnos fungerar... nån som hört om hypnoterapi? det fungerar.
dock inte så jävla lätt att bara lära sig, uppenbarligen.
men det fungerar."
,urmamma,2005-07-31T00:50Z,"Heh, lovar att 90% av dom som laddar hem det här inte vet vad riktig hypnos är.

""Ta av dig alla kläder...."" Jo men visst. :P"
,ZinZaH,2006-01-25T20:39Z,"I feel like experimenting these, but has anyone actually listened these through without going into hypnosis and can confirm that there are no harmfull suggestions given/hidden in the mp3's ?"
,Dallebulle,2006-02-15T16:25Z,köra detta efter en fet pipa med CB.. smaskens ;)
,rozzamd,2006-03-19T07:00Z,Looks like those that downloaded this torrent and listen to the audiobook could no longer  write English...woo..not my cup of tea.
,roonster,2006-05-16T07:58Z,spamming twat..
,m.kyung,2006-05-16T19:04Z,"Well, I feel a lot more motivated.  In fact, I got straight A's and made the Dean's List this semester.  I also have an irresistable urge to kill.  Thanks Hypnosis Super Pack!  "
,Miss G,2006-07-25T12:14Z,"A waste of time. It took me half a day to download this huge torrent. With 1 gig i thought it would be good quality. But to my great dissapointment most of the files/tracks are of extremely poor quality. Particularly the ones Im interested in, typically!  "
,nyrdil,2006-08-15T11:41Z,Something on this tape gave me the best wet dream for years. All i need as proof that It's great :p
,marcuselee,2006-10-04T03:35Z,"I was satified, but now these tapes have turned me into a flameing metrosexual.  If your a man, remove the ""Female Sexuality"" tape, for god's sake!

Does anyone knoiw of some macho heman hypnosis tapes to undo this and put me back the way I once was.? Oh God! I'm sliping away, just like all the others . . .  This Hypnos verkar ju skit ballt:P.. om d nu funkar, men jag vill ju inte hypnotisera mejsjälv, vill ju ha lite skoj me polarna:P.. nån som vet var man kan få tag på nån bok om d eller så? "
,GapeThatAss,2007-01-24T19:34Z,Please Seed!
,knightmad,2007-02-28T23:52Z,"I like this audiobooks a lot, specially that song with the chorus: 'Yvan eht nioj', 'Yvan eht nioj' .... Don't know why I have this urge to join the navy now ... errr, wait!"
,conrouss,2007-03-02T19:32Z,Great - Thx

,danijeldankic,2007-04-24T00:39Z,"GREAT speed!! Almost 1Mbit/s!
I hope this stuff works! Think I'm gonna try listen through it once before letting my self get ""programmed"" though;)"
,arafata,2007-04-25T23:09Z,"selfhypnosis isn't as hard as it sound. and it doesn't work like it do on tv. it feels like when youre daydreaming, or right before you fall asleep.  "
,Hypnotist,2007-05-13T04:31Z,"Wow 14,707 downloads!  And someone copied this on MiniNova but not as good!  I think its time i updated it and released a new one....    "
,shypys,2007-05-31T14:48Z,"Thanks Hypnotist =)
As with all the other self help dls, i got it, and now am procrastinating....

Cheers to the 23 seeders who still are keeping this alive.( I seeded to a ratio of 2. Hope you do 2. 2 2 2 2 2 2 2  arrrrrrrr spam....)

You may also want to get the Anthony Robbins BigPack(3 Gigs). It good too."
,u4e,2007-06-30T16:31Z,"Thanx for the dl Hypnotist, and thanks to all seeders. Now to find out if I can lose weight or end up eating the burned cd."
,uhura,2007-09-03T19:50Z,"Jag har hypnotiserat personer i snart 20 år, cå viist fungerar det. Men det är inte så 'magiskt' som många gärna vill tro.
Tex så är all hypnos är egentligen en typ av självhypnos."
,Codebender,2007-09-28T06:34Z,"Stop posting rar files dammit.  I'm not even going to bother with this because I only want two of those, and they look too small anyway.  Encoders automatically use ""Joint Stereo"" encoding for mid-quality mp3s which I think there's a good chance interferes with the binaural effect."
,shibby80,2007-10-07T01:58Z,would like to check only a couple of these out. why does it has to be a Rar file???????????? boo hoo 
,HAHA2FUNNY,2007-11-06T23:29Z,seed please
,Njordtser,2008-01-08T20:00Z,"Me can't evein rite enghlish anymore... this hypnos verkar ju skit ballt:P.. om d nu funkar, men jag vill ju inte hypnotisera mejsjälv, vill ju ha lite skoj me polarna:P.. nån som vet var man kan få tag på nån bok om d eller så? "

,ricco2123,2008-02-03T13:47Z,I've tried these. It's great. 
,piratedmoney,2008-02-26T09:06Z,"I downloaded a hypnosis mega pack, not this one, but the one i got off mininova I deleted almost immediately, cause the quality was garbage and the hypnotists were pretty spooky guys, it was a painful experience. For NLP there's only 2 guys you can rely on IMHO, Anthony Robbins and Paul Mckenna, watch them on youtube and you'll see that people really get positive results from them. Another really good guy for personal development is David Deangelo. These guys are good.
"
,piratedmoney,2008-02-26T09:10Z,"I've been listening to these guys for a long time and my english is just fine, so no worries. LOL :)"
,dquinn,2008-06-15T10:51Z,Downloaded rar - it's asking for password!  What do I do now?
,Informante,2008-09-10T00:55Z,"Uruha: Shut up you swedish ass, i too work with NLP and this sure as hell works. If you truly worked with NLP and hypnosis, you would have NO REASON to speak like that about what you do."
,ninetoes01,2008-10-27T03:44Z,"This thing is friggin awesome, but I'd like to comment that I don't recommend the four hour sleep one...worst thing ever!! Doesn't put you to sleep, just irritates...
but other then that, GREAT collection, and thanks so much!"
,GiantRies,2008-11-29T05:26Z,"You should all try erotic hypnosis.

It's like this stuff, but with sexy women causing you to orgasm without touching yourself!

You'll never go back after trying erotic hypnosis."
,catsmeow1962,2009-01-05T15:17Z,thank you for this information. I would really like to take advantage of it but for some reason when I down loaded it it went to my windows program and now I can't find it.  Is there anybody who is willing to download it for me and burn it off and send it to me.  I could pay for the time and effort. I can be reached at catsmeow1962@yahoo.com. Thanks cat
,Safixia,2009-03-15T04:17Z,"Hey Guys, Can someone please seed this, I've been stuck at 41% for weeks now! Thanks."
,Safixia,2009-04-05T07:33Z,"PLEASE SEED!!!!!!! I'VE BEEN STUCK AT 41% FOR OVER A MONTH NOW!!!!

Don't bother downloading this one people I'll let you know when the 73 seeders have decided to stop being selfish!!!"

,Safixia,2009-05-08T05:59Z,Come on people!! Someone seeded for a short time yesterday and then vanished.. !!! PLEEEEAAASSE SEEED!!!!
,Reisende Mac,2009-05-09T02:38Z,"I downloaded this a good while ago, it's a good torrent so I'm ""re-seeding"" it now, with all the original files included. I'm upping about 500kb/s and I see 48 other seeders in my client, so I think you should be ok.. :)"
,Safixia,2009-05-11T05:51Z,"Thanks Reisende Mac, your a star, looking forward to finally finishing this one off, I've been trying to download this for about 3 months now!"
,Safixia,2009-05-14T01:49Z,Hey Reisende lemme know what day/time you seed coz I'm still sitting on 0kb/s!!!
,Reisende Mac,2009-05-19T04:16Z,"Hmmm, I'm running smoothly about every night (Norwegian time, GMT+1) and most of the daytime as well, so I don't get why yours is standing still..? At the moment my uTorrent says there are 67 seeds and 115 peers, and I'm doing about 400 kb/s up.. Anyone else having problems?"
,Safixia,2009-05-21T02:44Z,"Yeah that is weird, I'm on GMT+9:30. I got to 98% and then it's stuck. Oh well will leave my comp on more often and hopefully I can get the final 2%!!! Cheers."
,LulzWat,2009-07-10T14:38Z,"Man...not to complain or anything, but I've been stuck on 98% for months now! Is there anything I can do?"
,Apollo Tloc,2009-07-11T05:09Z,"I downloaded this about a year ago, ALL of this is really amazing, except for the feminism and stop smoking stuff, but besides that, EXCELLENT. Great job Hypnotist!"

,EvilPeach,2010-02-15T13:01Z,"As a self taught hypnotist I really appreciate getting to hear the ""patter"" and learn from some of the best. thanks for the upload"
,steph17,2010-05-04T03:18Z,THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THESE. Really. Just that you put these up is going to help me so much in the coming months. I am so stressed out with junior college about to start and have super high anxiety and trouble sleeping (not that you care about any of that!) but really this is just going to be a big help to me.
