,backdrop,2005-04-01T18:40Z,"This is a superb documentary about Corporations. Since Corporations by law are seen as ""a legal person"" - meaning ""has the same rights/obligations a human"" - what kind of personality do they have? They examine this, and a lot more, in this movie with a sometimes humourous touch."

[T],BhangWalla,2006-06-09T13:24Z,"Dear BhangWalla, As co-director, producer and executive producer of the feature documentary The Corporation I\'m perplexed about the whole torrent thing. "
[T],BhangWalla,2006-06-09T13:24Z,"For a film with a radical critique, The Corporation has enjoyed remarkable success, with theatrical releases, TV broadcasts, and DVD sales in several countries.  The film has also found a huge audience in the world of torrents, with over two hundred thousand downloads. "
[T],BhangWalla,2006-06-09T13:24Z,"Sure, downloading leads to word-of-mouth promotion, forum discussion and to some sales, but the grim reality is that the revenues generated by the film have yet to cover the costs of making and promoting it. And for me, it\'s been almost 9 years of working on nothing else. That?s the equation that has to be addressed by all of us who care about the the film, the issues it raises, and the people who made it. "
[T],BhangWalla,2006-06-09T13:27Z,I\'m perplexed because I want the maximum audience for the film. That\'s why I made it in the first place. 
[T],BhangWalla,2006-06-09T13:27Z,"But I also need to survive financially and want to reward some of the key people who worked so hard on the film in a revenue-sharing plan. That, at present, is impossible."
[T],BhangWalla,2006-06-09T13:27Z,"I wish there were a way for torrent users to distinguish between the output of gigantic media conglomerates, and that of independent filmmakers to whom 200,000 downloads can mean the difference between financial success and financial disaster. "
[T],BhangWalla,2006-06-09T13:27Z,"There isn?t even a mechanism in place, if someone did actually want to pay a couple of bucks to download it via torrents. I?ve consulted a number of people who run torrent sites. I?ve poked around on discussion boards. But I have yet to discover any creative solutions that would actually work. "
[T],BhangWalla,2006-06-09T13:28Z,"The shareware model has been suggested, but how do you make it work through torrents? How can you make a DVD rip expire if someone doesn?t Paypal you a couple of bucks? At present, you can\'t. "
[T],BhangWalla,2006-06-09T13:28Z,"So until there?s a functional solution, I\'m asking the major torrent sites to block downloads of The Corporation, and for the most part, mainly because of DMCA, they\'ve been cooperative. I\'m also asking the torrent community for their support and understanding. "
[T],BhangWalla,2006-06-09T13:28Z,"I know you uploaded the film out of enthusiasm and support for it, and I really appreciate that, but I\'m asking you now if you\'ll please consider not seeding the film, and contemplate the implications of so many people watching The Corporation but not making a financial contribution to materially acknowledge the efforts of the filmmakers. Best, Mark Achbar

,fatfreddie,2006-08-11T23:42Z,"I am really pleased to find this torrent alive and well, as I've been searching for good qual ver of it for some time. Stupid me..I should've come to PB first :)
As to Mark Achbar's comment, well, it feels kinda different from all these fucked up threats others've been throwing around. Yeah, we bow our heads, as this is absolutely stunning doc - a MUST SEE !
Pity I'm so fucked up moneywise, but hey, once I get even I'll go spend some dosh on this movie.
It's one of these very special cases I would feel bad otherwise. Call me a romantic warrior if you will ;) And for the time beein, well, lets keep on seedin' ! Good work again, Bhang !"

,zombiebloodfeast,2006-12-31T23:04Z,"The maker of this documentary has made a very reasonable request, not threat, to help him cover making this film, and has even decided to release it for free, leaving it up to us to decide if this film is a success.

One might say money doesnt define success, yet this a chance for us to make a demonstration and reward good ethics and generosity.

I'm donating to show my support, and so should you.

,machbar,2007-03-29T06:27Z,"Thank you all for your consideration, understanding and continuing support. Sorry to have been such a whiner, but the financial realities vs over half a million downloads were really starting to bug me. I have finally broken even on the film, in small part due to voluntary contributions made at www.thecorporation.com. Since I put up the ""official"" filmmakers' torrent, almost 300 people have donated an average of $8.75. That's 300 donations vs tens of thousands of recent downloads. It's a pretty low batting average. While it's not going to finance another film, it all helps and is much appreciated. - Mark Achbar"
,bronco3,2009-01-16T13:47Z,"Could anyone out there RE-seed this film, PLZ! If so, could you write me end tell me that you do? holmia@live.se"
