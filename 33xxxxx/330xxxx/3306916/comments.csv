Thank you so much Nuclear for this torrents you're putting up.. You deserve a big hug, however, since you might be boy, it would seem kinda gay if I'd do that.. :P"
,dj_chewmacca,2005-08-14T10:03Z,Check out these mixes!!! - http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3360834
,segmentation-fault,2006-02-09T04:48Z,"160 kbps is a horrible bitrate!!! Sorry to say, NuclearM2, but your shares are poor.

If you want to share an album, you should share it with a decent quality (anything above 192 kbps). Also, split the CD tracks. It is much easier to join them than to split them.

Sorry. I'm just mad!!!"
