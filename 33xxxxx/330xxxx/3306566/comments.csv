,rorschach,2005-03-26T18:45Z,"yea, still doesn't work ! Installer still freezes"
,midimo,2005-03-30T11:57Z,"thanks for the warning, although it came too late for me. I downloaded another version that can be found on the Pirate Bay, the one with crack. This one also freezes when configuring Windows when installing. I suppose then that this is caused by the same problem (unless I did not follow the instructions of the crack correctly). When the installation froze, I finalized the process, but I did this 3 times. I don't know if this has allowed enough time for spyware to be installed. I'm looking for filename ""bpk"", but no search results. Please help me out. What more should I do?"
,wfreewrew,2005-03-31T01:02Z,"google for bpk.exe and you will get the picture. 
Open taskmanager in windows and check for any suspicious process, if found google for that process info."
,midimo,2005-03-31T02:27Z,"thanks for your help. This is the first time I get introduced to this topic. I have googled for bpk.exe and found a lot of information about spyware and spyware removers. I have search for bpk.exe on my hard-drive, but I haven't found anything. Nor do I detect any strange process in my task manager. However I did scan my hard-disk with 3 spyware detection programs that found some non-harmful cookies, but also spyware from ""Ciara"", a legit on-line marketing behaviour company. Of course, I know what you are thinking, and I am thinking it too: Get the fuck away from my computer! I am wondering whether this program or file came with the installation of Systran or whether it is downloaded from some webpage I frequently visit. I suppose it's hard to protect yourself from every virus and spyware. I normally reinstall my software every month. This should get the bugs out. For now I believe there is no harmful risk, I did not want to buy the spyware removers (once detected, to remove them you have to register and pay). Perhaps I will find one for free with crack on the Pirate Bay. What do you think? Should I still be worried?

Anyway, thanks again. Have a nice day!

Saludos from Barcelona,

,midimo,2005-03-31T16:21Z,"I went on searching for a free spyware detection application that also removes spyware for free and I have found adaware personal which supposedly has done the job for me. It also found ""Claria"" (motherfuckers!) and another one I don't recall it's name (Can't find the name of the file anymore, because ""Spyhunter"" does not detect these kind of files anymore. Removed by Adaware!). 

What do you know. A Swedish company also! If it weren't so cold up there, I would consider moving there. Besides the cold, it appears to be a great country!

Regards from Barcelona again and many thanks (learned a great lesson, found some nice spyware detection application and got my laptop on full speed again)!

,Mashingo,2005-05-25T01:27Z,"Hi,
I read your discussions about spyware - I am not so scared of it because I seldom start my PC. It is a virtual PC inside the Mac (G5), and it works quite well. I use it only when I cannot find a Mac version of a program. (Quite nice actually, I have been runnig Mac since 1984 without any virus program, and I never had any problem, touch wood).
But this Systran gives me the same problem as you have - I have found three versions, and all three have frozen during installation. The first one was actually the best - it may even work, but the serial number was a phonie...

,arazano,2005-06-03T09:24Z,"it works with my pc, not any problem at all,
