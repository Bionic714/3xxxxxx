,bobfufk,2005-04-19T17:56Z,"can someone please help seed, we are 5 meg off completion :("
,mGoLos,2005-07-01T23:10Z,"Downloading it now, will seed in 12 minutes"
,mGoLos,2005-07-02T01:03Z,"Also, when you want to find old or very rare/underground stuff, DC++ is the way to it. It's a very different system though and demands a little work and search effort, it also demands a little time for caching a decent amount of shared files (say 80 gbs REAL releases and files, nothing installed and basically useless), use netlimiter if you want to limit the upload. I hope this can help somebody, somewhere :)"

,blacklung2002,2006-07-15T23:06Z,This is bullshit. Out of 611MB I have 607MB downloaded and its stopped. Someone needs to seed this thing for 5 minutes so I can get this downloaded and seed it for everyone else.

Thanks"
