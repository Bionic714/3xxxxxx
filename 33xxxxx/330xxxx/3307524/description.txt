"One of the early and by many considered to be one of Norways definitely best prog bands. Their music is a mix of heavy hard-rocking tunes, combined with clear influences from the symphonic genre. The more symphonic sound however didn't appeared until their third, and last studio album, "Janus". A great concept-album to start with. If you want the more thundering sounds coming from AUNT MARY, look for 1972s "Loaded". High-skilled musicians combined with good, creative melodies makes AUNT MARY a important Norwegian band to become acquainted with."-PA

"One of Norways finest bands and their best album. This particular slice of Norwegian progressive psychedelia dates from 1972(originallly on Phillips) with some great guitar and Hammond organ interplay, backed up with English vocals expertly arranged and executed. The bands finest hour that adds up to a really excellent album, that would grace any self-respecting psych or prog fans collection. -FE
