,ikaros,2005-04-01T13:36Z,"It sounds like the sound skips and jumps on some of the songs. Haven't heard all, but especially the first tracks seems broken."
,AnyJive,2005-07-02T19:40Z,"I get that skipping too...I think it's something to do with Torrents, the way they download.

If you don't get 100% of the torrent, then there's potentially pieces missing from all the songs in the torrent...and that causes skipping.

So what's the moral of this story?

DON'T BOTHER DOWNLOADING MP3 ALBUMS THAT DON'T HAVE SEEDERS...

...your just wasting your time."
