,mjarvegren,2006-02-19T01:38Z,Plz. Seed.
,mattalexx,2006-07-29T02:52Z,This is the only copy of this on the Internet.  Could someone please seed it?
,mattalexx,2006-07-29T19:54Z,All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth...   And for someone to seed this kick a** album!
,mattalexx,2006-07-30T18:14Z,"Thanks to the person that seeded.  I'll keep a seed going until we have a nice swarm on this one.  There's also a FLAC version over on Demonoid, but I don't have an invitation."
