I will propably be offline for 2,5 weeks, please come back to join us on June 29th.
Sorry for the inconvenience."
,EastCoastBoy,2005-06-15T06:06Z,"Thanks for letting us know.  I'm personally very interested in getting this as I had been familiar with the Mr. Rossi films as a kid, though they hardly made much of an appearance in the US aside from a few VHS releases in the '80s."
,steffen123,2005-06-28T12:13Z,"Hi EastCoastBoy, I am back from Greece (brown like Nazi-sh*t). Did you note that the Audio is GERMAN ? I hope this is not a problem..."
,EastCoastBoy,2005-06-28T22:30Z,Thanks for coming back.  Of course I don't have a problem with it being in German myself.  I tend to favor watching foriegn language editions anyway.  Makes interesting to compare and contrast how a particular film is handled.
,EastCoastBoy,2005-07-01T20:33Z,"Yeah, I guess this is just the German version then.  Had the impression I would get both German and Italian here as the DVDs are supposed to have.  Not too many people do like to write enough infomation in their comments on these torrents.  Most times it's essential to provide enough info so some of us don't get the wrong idea.

I assume from the way you've presented this DVD to us, you've stripped the Italian portion of the disc to fit it all on a single-layer disc instead of shrinking it all.

Again, thanks for having this file up and all!"
,steffen123,2005-07-01T22:43Z,"Well, I am sorry for failing to make this clear. I thought the name and comment ""DVD deutsch "" would be enough, sorry again. 

No I did not strip anything since I pulled this from eMule which took centuries of time.
BTW there is some italian in the extras."
,eidannemo,2005-07-08T02:51Z,"Hi Steffen,

sind da jetzt  nur 4 Folgen drauf oder alle ?
Wird weitergeseedet, und falls nicht alle Folgen drauf sind, werden die restlichen auch noch kommen??

THX"
,steffen123,2005-07-08T21:38Z,"Hi, no movies or extras are stripped, it is all there just like the Amzazon sells it. Just 4 stories plus bonus material. I will cont to seed for annother while, even if most people are done."
,drlecter,2005-08-14T17:27Z,"Hi Steffen, hab das Torrent komplett runtergeladen aber irgendwie fehlt mir die Audiospur kann das sein? 

Im Hauptordner befindet sich der Unterordner ""video_ts"" sowie das Cover.jpg

Die .vob´s lassen sich alle öffnen und laufen auch aber leider ohne Ton. Was mach ich falsch?

Gruß, drlecter"
