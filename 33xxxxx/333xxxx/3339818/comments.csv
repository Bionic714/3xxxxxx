,AntiJw,2005-07-06T19:07Z,BTW: A waste of DVDR's to have this (Series1) on 2 DVD-R's. I used DVDShrink (skipped menu&extras) to fit whole Series1 in 1 DVD-R..
,dtddiver,2005-07-06T20:36Z,"Yup, you're right. But I think you will find that series 2, 3 and 4 are better quality."
,ceciliastar1,2007-11-26T14:52Z,"Sereis 1, 2 and 3 worked beautifully! But I can't find series 4 anywhere??? The links provided don't work.  Help!!"
,m1cke70,2008-01-20T07:54Z,waste of time to load this....this fucker has no subs
,klerikus,2008-02-03T18:46Z,"Its a great series, respect for the uploader!
Howewer this stuff is rather poor quality, almost same as  my tvrip."
,pompas123,2008-05-17T13:39Z,"I found the fourth season here.
(I'm currently downloading so I can't verify it)
