The battle between good and evil is so evenly balanced, that should it continue, all will be destoyed
So, hundreds of years ago, the battle was stopped. The forces of Light and the forces of Darkness  
made a deal neither good not evil can take place without mutual consent. And a Day Watch was created,
to watch over the forces of Light, with a Night Watch to watch over the forces of Darkness. But after
a thousand years, the Great Other will come, and choose the side of Evil ...                                                                                  
That's the backdrop for a modern-day epic trilogy; Night Watch shows how the Great One was found and
why he chose the way he did.
