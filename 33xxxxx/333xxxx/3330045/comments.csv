The battle between good and evil is so evenly balanced, that should it continue, all will be destoyed
So, hundreds of years ago, the battle was stopped. The forces of Light and the forces of Darkness   
made a deal neither good not evil can take place without mutual consent. And a Day Watch was created, 
to watch over the forces of Light, with a Night Watch to watch over the forces of Darkness. But after 
a thousand years, the Great Other will come, and choose the side of Evil ...                                                                                  
That's the backdrop for a modern-day epic trilogy; Night Watch shows how the Great One was found and 
why he chose the way he did.  "

,Paradoxclaw,2005-05-14T10:57Z,"The subs from the webpage doesnt seem to work... Or at least, i wont get it to work.. :("
,gschall,2005-05-14T14:17Z,"There is a small difference between the movie and subtitle filenames. Rename the first subtitle file to Night.Watch.2004.CD1.DVDRiP.XViD-FiCO.srt and it will work just fine.

Thanks for the link to the English subtitles and for this excellent movie! 

Hopefully there will be an European DVD release soon."

,Porrfarfar,2005-05-16T03:32Z,"Yeah, anyone up for teaching us morons how to get the damn subs to work?

Pretty please?"
,azzidoos,2005-06-07T20:46Z,"Cant get the subs to work, don´t know about you guys but my skills in the russian language is not good enough to let me do without subs..."
,azzidoos,2005-06-09T00:20Z,"Hmz, did´nt consider that the filenames could be case sensitive. The .srt's that could be downloaded from the preveiously posted url worked fine once they had the same names as their avi's."
,Wormsworth,2005-07-07T10:03Z,It appears that the English subs for CD1 are missing.  Does anyone have a source for them?
