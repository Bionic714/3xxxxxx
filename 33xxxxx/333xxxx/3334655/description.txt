This BBC documentary takes us on the road to Hollywood, with Thompson and Ralph Steadman, passing Las Vegas once more, and mixed with several interviews in the dukes residence in Woody Creek. It is basically an introduction into Thompson`s work, offering nothing new to the die-hard HST fan. But there are some cool and wacky scenes that I as Hunter S. Thompson geek truly enjoyed, like the short footage of the interview after the Aspens Sheriff election, where he ran as candidate for the Freak Power ticket or the the meeting with John Dean of the infamous Nixon staff. And seeing the king of gonzo crouching behind a car in a parking lot in Hollywood, because he can`t handle the scene is priceless.

The bad recitations of his work (mainly focused on Fear and Loathing)got on my nerves, but all in all, this is absolutely worth watching for any Thompson fan out there and besides it made me realize what a hell of a job Bill Murray, who also has a short appearance, did in "Where the Buffalo roam".
