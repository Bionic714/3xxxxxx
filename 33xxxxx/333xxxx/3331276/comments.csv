,Josid,2005-08-10T19:49Z,seed it please
,tavisjohn,2006-05-01T02:36Z,"This is a TV Rip, low res (320x323 average), Commertial Free.

Some are pretty poor quality others are decent.

Divx Player plays them better than WinAmp does."
,azrith,2006-05-02T05:10Z,"Thanks a bunch for this. Anyone who can seed a bit please do so. 

Cheers"
,Noxlux,2006-07-02T09:30Z,"This is undeniably one of the best animated shows ever produced. I hesitate to call it a childrens show (even though it is), because it should not be lumped  into the same category as the crap that is aired nowadays.
There is continuity between the episodes, there is character progression, there is a rather intricate background story. And watch out for the Illuminati as well.

Now please seed it, current availability is at 0.949 - we need at least one with the whole thing."
,DL-chan,2006-10-13T18:00Z,"Seasons 1 and 2 are now available on DVD. Perfect quality. I'd rip them and post them here for download, except that my computer doesn't do that. They come with extras and all that."
,Dirty50ck5,2007-08-27T19:01Z,"Noxlux - I agree with you completely, and even though this was one of my favorite shows as a kid, looking back I realize how many cultural/literary references I missed at the time. Classic mythology and Shakespeare references abound in this series."
,tronson01,2009-08-14T19:13Z,Hello everyone. I love this show and once I finish downloading it I will seed it for as long as I possibly can. Each night before I go to bed I will up my upload limit to 250 kb/s. I game during the day time so I will try to keep it around 80 or 90 kb/s
