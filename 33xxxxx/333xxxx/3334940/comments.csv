,Kronocide,2005-05-23T08:19Z,"It is an amazing series, but that is one movie I'll watch at the theater. (Same with Star Wars III). :-)"

,Ominae182,2005-07-17T21:12Z,"Fuckers, if anyone has episodes 4-6 please seed them, mine just aren't getting done."
,love_tropicana,2005-07-19T16:07Z,För svenska undertexter till serien ta en titt på http://www.rootdown.se/tsf/. Jag översätter den för fulla muggar (^____^)
,Ominae182,2005-07-20T14:40Z,Mine sat at like 94% for 2 days. Must've been local problems but I figured maybe people sharing didn't have those files or something.
,jnd,2005-07-21T22:16Z,Thanks for this one! And thanks Kronocide for seeding until then! :-)
,mannygldstn,2005-07-23T20:30Z,awesome download. excellent quality!
,The_ichi,2005-07-29T18:27Z,fins det någon Ep2 på firefly
,-AgamemnoN-,2005-07-30T22:16Z,"I've heard alot of good things about this show so i thought i was going to give it a shot. But on tv tome it is said that it should be 15 episodes, and i only have 13 episodes and two extras... Is this correct? I was thinking that maybe there are some double episodes? 

But my last episode are e13 Heart of Gold while on tv tome, e15 The Message are the last one..."
,Kronocide,2005-07-31T03:17Z,"""Objects in Space"" is the final episode when they are in the right order. There are 14 episodes, one of which is a pilot of twice the normal length. This often counts as two episodes."
,Kronocide,2005-07-31T23:50Z,So only download that ep then. (You just need a client like Azureus where you can choose what files to download.)
,-AgamemnoN-,2005-08-01T01:32Z,"Well, if that's the case im still missing one episode and that would actually be objects in space..."
,campus9,2005-08-06T19:49Z,"this does have all the episodes 1-14. Remember, though, buy the dvd is you like it and support a great franchise!"
[V],olingskoG,2006-01-13T21:40Z,THANK YOU! I loked at ( Serenity - the movie of this  serie.. and i just have to look at this.. the movie rocked !
,Exorph,2006-02-10T07:29Z,My download keeps failing.. any idea wgy?
,shrivelednoodle,2006-12-18T21:02Z,"I am truly amazed this is still floating around.  I'm 99% sure this was my rip from  Dec '03.  I wasn't all that proud of it.  It was my first official rip.  The subtitles were released as a separate torrent if memory serves me correctly.  Anyone know where that is?  I wrote the ""corrections nfo"" because I was all confused with the tv.com ep list and the dvd ep list.  Anyhoo great show keep seeding it forever cause it makes me feel warm and fuzzy."
,ignorance1977,2007-10-13T19:11Z,"Such a shame this show was cancelled.
at the moment there is a online petition for getting Firefly back in production.
