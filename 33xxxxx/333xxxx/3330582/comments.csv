Very easy to shrink with dvd shrink, instead all of us have to do it.

Do that thenext time you upload something."

,bagge2,2005-05-19T03:38Z,"HIV:
we who like to put some effort in the transcoding, e.g using Big 3 and similar don't want a DVDShrink copy. Why? Because the quality is not as good as CCE. 

Especially not if you want to improve imagequality further, like using htpc + ffdshow + dvi + plasmascreen."
