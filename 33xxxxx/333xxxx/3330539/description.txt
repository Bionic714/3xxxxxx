"Besides the wealth of chiselled echo-techno he's recorded as Mike Ink, M:I:5, Love Inc. and Studio One, Berlin producer Wolfgang Voigt released several albums of more expansive music as Gas. Voigt debuted the project with the Modern EP on his own Profan Records in 1995, then released Gas two years later on Mille Plateaux. In contrast to his previous work's stark austerity, the Gas LP presented tracks of murky ambience with even murkier percussion. Zauberberg followed in 1998, and two years later Voigt returned with Pop. [See Also: Burger/Ink, Mike Ink, Love Inc.]" ~ John Bush, All Music Guide

This is amazing music. I've never came across such suggestive moods since. Once it starts you are sucked into another world and lose track of time. Excellent for falling asleep, painting, jogging or walking. Königsforst is my favorite. Listening to it puts me into a vast forest of tall pines on a walk with no direction, no goal, no demands, and this is even without any forest sounds in the music. Zauberberg is a bit same, perhaps opener, freer, like in the mountains. Pop is more like water, and has waterlike sounds woven into the repetitive shifting beats. Perhaps inspired by Vangelis "Oceanic"? Zauberberg track 4 has a unique blend of vinyl record crackling and a non stop basedrum and moods almost like Laibachs MacBeth. Details like these makes this music one of a kind.
