This is an excellent video from the Gumball 3000 rally start in London the 14th May 2005. It covers some of the preparations before the rally as well as the parade of all the 120 supercars (including a Ferrari Enzo, a Pagani Zonda, a Farboud GT, two Lamborghini Murci√©lagos, a bunch of Ferrari 360s and F430s, a stretched Hummer H2, a tank and an incredible amount of Porsches). Please let me know what you think of it. Thanks.
