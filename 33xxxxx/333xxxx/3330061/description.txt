'As usual with Greenaway, the ideas are large, endless and perverse; and they are teased out with the exquisite formal perfection of a court minuet. Moreover he frames, colours and shoots with a top dollar precision. A film with all the cool, intellectual thrill of the Kasparov-Karpov game.'
- Chris Peachment, Time Out
