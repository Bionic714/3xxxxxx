,ScarecrowDK,2005-06-03T10:17Z,"The NFO says the video is untouched, and the SCREAM release is encoded (avg bitrate 4281. 6-pass CCE).

Strangely enough the size of the movie is smaller than the SCREAM release .. perhaps it's the SCREAM release where they havn't encoded the video FURTHER?"
,smirren,2005-06-03T17:38Z,How about seeding at least until one of us get it and take over?????Please?????
,nicowallin,2005-06-03T20:00Z,WTF... the image is not complete... how about checking before u seed it... grrrrrr....
,SmygeR,2005-06-03T22:26Z,"this is not the scream release with swesub.

it is a TC. not DVDR."
,briank,2005-06-04T00:39Z,"Trashstar: Thanks

Does it effect the quality in anyway when they put subtitels on the film (in this case:  will the quality be better on the Scream realese without subtitles?) "
