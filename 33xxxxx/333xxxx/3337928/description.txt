   Notes:
   ======
   No retail DVD exists (afaik) for this concert. The source "DVD" is
   probably a home made rip. The quality isn't perfect, and the video
   turns crappy at times. Still, the resulting rip is definitely of a
   better quality than any other Rock In Rio rips.

   I used the Matroska container for the concert. The Matroska format
   supports chaptering, so you can skip songs in the video.

   Some media players (Media Player Classic, The Core Media Player,
   VLC) come with Matroska support. If you use other players, you can
   use the Matroska_Pack_Lite_v1.0.3.exe included in the /Extras folder.

   Enjoy this high quality rip from -AJ-
