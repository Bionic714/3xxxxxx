BTW: Didya know that he recently stopped showing up for the taping of the 3rd season of Chappelle's Show. Apparently, he has gone to South Africa and joined a recreation centre for the mentally ill :S If someone has the balls to full of such a joke, it's gots to be Chappelle....Lets just hope it is a joke then...:)"
