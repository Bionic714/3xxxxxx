Here are a few pearls roughly from the years 1965-1975 where the fusion-progressive music really was created.

Artists range from legendary Mahavishnu Orchestra, mystic Sun Ra, brilliant Nucleus to Baden-Powell from Brazil and Terje Rypdal from Norway.

I recommend Soulseek - www.slsk.org if you want to hear more of these artists.
