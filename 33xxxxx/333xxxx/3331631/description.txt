Second part of this great german televisionplay - Enjoy this!

Though HEIMAT runs an imposing 15-and-a-half hours, this epic work, chronicling life in a German village from 1919 to 1982, rarely fails to capture the viewer within its immense visionary scope. The events of the period--Germany's post-WWI depression, the rise of Nazism, WWII, and postwar recovery--are seen not through the eyes of Germany's leaders, politicians, and artists, but through the eyes of the common people in the fictional village of Schabbach. At the center of the events is Breuer, who gives a remarkable performance. Using makeup, costumes and her gifted acting talents, Breuer gives HEIMAT a heartfelt anchor, playing her character from childhood to old age.
