,rudolfo2,2005-05-19T12:08Z,All data is OK.You have corrupt data.I have burned the DVD without a problem.Bring on the second disk.
,xtremeBit,2005-05-19T22:21Z,"Thanks very much, please seed the other discs when you have a chance.
"
,Celloooo,2005-05-20T00:05Z,Hi! Just wondering... Is it the original picture quality? or is it re-encoded ? Keep up the great work! =) 
,xtremeBit,2005-05-20T12:20Z,"Thanks for the info, Disc 2 needs more seeds.  I guess no one has been able to find it...  160 days to go : )


BTW, when looking for Enterprise S1D2, go here:
http://thepiratebay.org/download.php/3333025/enterprise_season1_disc2.torrent

For reasons unknown, you can't find it searching for ""Enterprise"" or ""Star Trek"", just browsing the DVD-R uploads..."
,SlayerW,2005-05-21T21:23Z,"sorry they are not my rips, just took them off usenet"
,SlayerW,2005-05-21T21:26Z,"about corrupt files,

again it's not my rip, but i have burn-tested it before seeding it here and there seems to be no problems in burning the discs"
,elruts,2005-05-26T21:40Z,Anyone knows where I can find the covers?
,KronicAC,2005-05-29T10:46Z,Has the 3rd disc been uploaded yet?
,AndyCris,2005-05-31T22:40Z,"Hey what happened to the other discs in the Box^

Are the other disca going to be released?

Please let us know. We need them badly.

Thanks"
,seantb,2005-06-02T22:48Z,"still waiting for disk 3-7, someone please get them soon"
,seantb,2005-06-03T18:10Z,you can see disk to if you just do a search for enterprise.... it is about 6-10th on the list
,LingonGPA,2005-06-15T10:51Z,"Humm ska det vara är det bara så här kort avsnitt på 4.37 GiB , känns som väldigt mycket utrymme för så lite film."
,Siddus,2005-06-20T01:48Z,Vad är det för subbar på denna ????
,Bones4283,2005-07-14T17:19Z,Hey can more people seen the D1 and D2 for Enterprise? Its realy slow.. Also has the other Disks came out yet?
,Timilim,2005-07-22T15:00Z,Is this with Swedish subs?
,Alamo,2006-02-18T11:50Z,"Just curious...
Is this the VERY first episode of the Star Trek series? I have been looking for that all over the net."
,jhUyYds,2006-03-19T23:11Z,"No, you'll want to search for The Original Series (TOS) for that. Should be easy to find. In the collection of season one, you should be able to find the very first, the one that was not aired at first in the sixties."
