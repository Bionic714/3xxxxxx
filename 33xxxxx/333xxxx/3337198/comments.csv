,Lautsprecher,2005-05-28T18:04Z,Any alternatives to Step 4? I don't have a USB CD/DVD-drive. and i doubt most people do.
,gcoghlan,2005-05-28T18:23Z,SCSI cd drive will also work. Currently only way to get latest Starforce ( 3.4.71.19 or greater) Clone CD's to run.
,SNS_PeTTs0n,2005-05-28T20:06Z,Does this work with a USB CD-R/RW Drive? (hp4e)
,gcoghlan,2005-05-29T01:34Z,yes should be no prob
,bugmenot1,2005-05-29T02:23Z,"Whoever gets this to work, please post a message to confirm, so that we can save our bandwidth for releases that actually work.  I'm not saying this one doesn't, it would just be nice to know if we are wasting our time."
,opiants,2005-05-29T09:06Z,"Is this for real?

the mds is only 4kb???"
,pahis,2005-05-29T11:28Z,Does daemon tools work
,zwalter,2005-05-29T13:49Z,Have someone tried this one with a normal CD drive? does it work and how
,zwalter,2005-05-29T14:56Z,.
,monkey1977,2005-05-29T18:01Z,"DOES NOT WORK!!!!!! Tried all the steps provided (twice) and this clone does not manage to successfully bypass the protection. 
Haven't tried Deamon Tools, but i suspect the problem will occur here too.

(and yes- i did use a USB drive - and also a built in one)

not worth the effot :("
,Mortibus,2005-05-29T18:10Z,WORKS FOR ME 100% JUST DISABLE IDE CHANNEL2 & NODE WITH SFN 1.12
,monkey1977,2005-05-29T18:59Z,"Mortibus: Oh okay!!!!

Must be something I am doing wrong! Did you mount the game with DaemonTools or burn it to CD and install??

I take it that the player key supplied worked okay for you to?????

If you could help i'd really appreciciate it :)    :) "
,Serial-K,2005-05-29T19:34Z,IS IT WORKING WITHOUT USB DRIVE?
,Celloooo,2005-05-29T20:28Z,"I used daemon tool, and it didnt work.. =("
,gcoghlan,2005-05-30T00:04Z,Make sure you do not have any other CD/DVD drives connected. Use SFN if you have to or disable IDE channels in bios.  IT WILL WORK:)
,chrille85,2005-05-30T02:03Z,gcoghlan  can you explain how you did? since these 4 steps doesn't seem to work. thanks
,opiants,2005-05-30T05:01Z,"This one is working 10000%!!!! I can gurantee you if you have a usb drive!!!!

Wohooo!!!!!

Here is what I did?
Follow the 4 steps.
*Before running Trackmania after install. Disable all physical CD drives using Starforce Nightmare. Be sure to disable node.

*Let the SF drivers install. Reboot.
*Disable all CD drives again (same as the last step)
*Insert the CD you burn in the USB CD/DVD Drive!
*Play the GAME!!!!!!"
,chrille85,2005-05-30T05:10Z,so it wotn work with ppl that doesnt have usb drives?
,opiants,2005-05-30T05:32Z,"Sorry :( 
but no it wont"
,chrille85,2005-05-30T06:31Z,thats shit. ;
,monkey1977,2005-05-30T09:14Z,"So - just two more questions!!!!

Do you have to disable ALL drives INCLUDING the USB one, or just all the others?

And, do you have to do this every time you play the game??

Oh, and one more (!!!), In Starforce Nightmare how do i know which drives to disable????? I havent a clue - is the the IDE's????!??!?!

Thanks in advance
"
,opiants,2005-05-30T11:38Z,"Just press the disable CD and then press the disable Node. 

You have to do this everytime the system is restarted and you want to play the game and everytime you enable your CD drives again.

When you press disable CD, it disables all IDE CD drives so your USB drive will still be enabled. Place the CD there and play the game :)"
,gcoghlan,2005-05-30T12:47Z,"I have uploaded the High Precision version of the .mds file. May help with some CD/DVD Writers. It is only 28K :)

,microbar,2005-05-31T18:24Z,Anyone got a spare usb drive lol. 
,Owan,2005-06-01T02:32Z,Does anyone run the game without usb drive. Only with deamon or other virtual drive. Pls write how to do it :) Maybe with mini image or something:)
,KAROLOYDI,2005-06-01T03:21Z,What's the difference of usb drives that makes them work?
,richard_king,2005-06-03T12:55Z,"u know i will not play this game untill it is cracked 
and i invite every cracker to do so as even i bought the original cd it is very easy to scratch and starforce4 will not recogize it again !!!!!!"
,javius,2005-06-04T19:48Z,I must say Starforce is very effective. No way I am going through all this to play the game. Even though I know it is good.
,alip,2005-06-05T02:50Z,THIS DOES NOT WORK WE NEED A CRACK OR MINI IMAGE!
,Gia,2005-06-05T09:38Z,"it's not starforce, it's just a sucky release. Too bad any of the big scene groups doesn't bother with these games :/"
,jdrake_2,2005-06-06T04:29Z,"The original Trackmania was a masterpiece.  Instead of trying to copy/crack it, why don't we all just buy it and support the guys who made it?
Seriously, how many great games a year come a long like this - two, three?  
Just buy the damn game already."

Install the game - Full Installation.

Disable any CD-ROM/Writers and/or DVD-ROM/Writers using StarForce Nightmare.

Mount the TRACKMANIA.MDS CD-Image in Daemon Tools v3.47 or the latest Alcohol 120%.

Play the Game!

ENJOY!!!!!"
,PinkSpider,2005-06-24T21:55Z,"Haha, you're such newbies. Buy the game if you can't do it this game. Geez."

,skez,2005-07-05T04:09Z,can I use Daemon instead of burning?
,soulpredator,2005-07-05T11:10Z,WELL!! i must bleaming moron.. cos i cant get this to work.. neither on deamon or with burning.. did exactly what it says and up until the update of the game it went ok.. then it says..   Protection Software Installed.. reboot? if i press yes it reboots and im stuck with startforce again. if i dont it wont do anything! if i reboot and startforce is installed ittle crap about inserting original CD. if i remove startforce again reboot and run the game ittle try to install it again...  ALTHO im NOT using a USB drive.. so i guess you HAVE to use a USB drive... ohwell... Good Luck to everybody
,soulpredator,2005-07-05T11:28Z,"ok now.. chucked deamon, installed Alcohol... chucked my CD drive with SFNightmaire. now it seems to do more.. opens the protection system again and says ""Checking Disc""  but i can wait till my balls fall off but it stays on 1 point and eventually crashes... so i dunno anymore"
,soulpredator,2005-07-05T11:41Z,"OK! so now it runs thru the disc check.. but still i get a error "" Insert the TRACKMANIA SUNRISE disc into another drive then press ""Retry"".

,Kimbo Kastekniv,2006-05-28T11:16Z,"This way should work, but I can't guarantee it:
STEP 1: Download and start SF Nightmare (Google it) and click on the following buttons:
Disable Ch 1
Disable Ch 2
Disable node
Disable CD
STEP 2: Download, install, run the latest Daemon Tools (Google it) and click at ""Emulation"" on ""All options on""
STEP 3: Mount the image in Daemon Tools and install the game
STEP 4: Start the game and enter the following CD Key when asked:
KRXM-DXGX-CNX4-BNXF-WJJ"
,Kimbo Kastekniv,2006-05-28T11:16Z,"STEP 5: When asked to restart the computer, click on ""Ok""

STEP 7: Start up the PC
STEP 8: Mount the image in Daemon Tools, if it isn't still mounted
STEP 9: Run the game using the link on desktop or in startmenu"

Checking Disc....

,Kimbo Kastekniv,2006-05-29T17:21Z,"Then I think the image is bad, maybe it works with another image (delete the game and install the game using the other image is I think the best solution). But I'm not a computertechnician, so maybe this won't work either.
You could also try to install the game using a USB CD-Rom drive. Or using a common CD-Rom drive using a USB to IDE cable. I've read elsewhere that that works fine.
The third and final solution is: buy the game!"
