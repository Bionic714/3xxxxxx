This movie/docu is one of the better surf movies there is!
Its about ""BiG WAVE"" riding and its origins.

Starts out with Greg Noll on Hawaii in the 1950s Hawaii and the Big wave riding that paved the way for ppl like:
Jeff Clark and ""his"" MAvericks"" outsode California, then we meet the man/oceanGOD Laird Hamilton...
We see the birth of ""Tow-in"" and the the taming of ""Jaws"" (Peahi).
And culminates in the perfect wave, the monster that is ""Chopu""...

Enjoy your wet dreams :)"
