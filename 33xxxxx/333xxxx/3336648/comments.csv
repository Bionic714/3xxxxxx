,Morphen,2005-05-27T08:05Z,Why remove tracks ??
,DaCapoKVH,2005-05-27T08:14Z,"No need to have the same tracks twice in a collection, unless you want to spoil HDD-space. All tracks are there, so if you want you can duplicate them to the ''incomplete albums''.
Furthermore you can of course add several ''Best of'' albums, then you have it ''COMPLETE!''"
,Morphen,2005-05-28T21:19Z,"Harddisks are cheap and BIG.
Some ""unnecessary"" tracks can't make that much difference."
,Veon_,2005-06-14T00:25Z,Why is nobody seeding?? I've been stuck at 643 MB for a whole day now! :( And I would really like to finish this particular download.. 
,Hugo Chรกvez,2005-07-01T22:28Z,"We should all make a music-project to inform people about the improtance of seeding, it should be like Live 8 or something, but bigger."
,forgot10,2005-07-24T04:41Z,Really need someone to seed...stuck at 98.2%....getting blue balls at that percent man.
,me_69,2005-08-08T22:21Z,seed please...
,Palm91,2006-10-01T18:09Z,"seed plz, i really want this :)"
,zoozi,2007-01-16T16:37Z,A great collection! Thank you!
,trenskow,2008-01-10T12:21Z,"This is great. My R.E.M. CD's are all in the attic, because i ripped them 10 years ago in a terrible quality, so this is just great. Thanks a lot."
,the_inquisition,2008-03-18T17:19Z,Thanks. Much appreciated.
,TheSickTicket,2008-05-14T05:27Z,is there a list of deleted tracks with the torrent? if not can ya post one here so's i can satisfy my audiophilic nature and copy and paste em back into existence?
,killerener999,2008-05-19T20:59Z,you still need accelerate
,drader,2008-05-30T22:11Z,I'm sure he'd have added accelerate if he could travel into the future and then add it when he went 'back in time' to 2005 when this torrent was made.

,cat_hat,2008-07-23T20:06Z,some people are too picky complain too much...

,aviquezm,2008-12-05T15:10Z,seeeed plzzzz...
,roqulere,2009-01-17T05:35Z,Either seed or remove.
,ror_b211,2009-03-22T21:55Z,"Stop whining about removed doubles, canardon has actually done you a favour by going through the trouble to remove them. 

Why would you want 2 of exactly the same song? Pointless and extends download time."
,Frukfruk,2009-03-26T05:25Z,"Thank you, canardon!"
,OOHMATRON,2009-07-18T01:06Z,"I want to make it clear I appreciate the upload, but in regards to the deleting tracks I think it is wrong.

The reason(s) you want two of the same song::

You play an album and want to hear every song.

You want to download just one album from the discography.

I could probably think of more reasons but cant be bothered.

Thanks"
,huemac,2009-09-12T10:35Z,"can't anyone mention the fucking quality!?!?!?!

dammit shit...

thank you for the work man"
,FoeTea,2009-12-10T19:32Z,Appreciate the effort. Thank you very  much
,ericdare4287,2010-03-12T07:33Z,"nice work
but please, dont call it a discography, if every song from every album is there, who cares if the same song is tehre 2 or 3 times, songs are not a big file, by a bigger harddrive, they arent that expensive, i got a 2tb hd for $200"
,acfreema,2010-05-27T07:36Z," If you're not pleased with this ""discography"", compile one yourself.  I am also disappointed by the removal of tracks; however, I will not complain, I'm not interested in going through the trouble of recreating each album."

,saltmanstoner,2011-03-10T01:34Z,"@forgot10: LOL at 'torrent blueballs'. Is that on urban dictionary yet?. Don't have very fast up, but will seed a 1:1."
,thrillajacko,2011-03-17T11:14Z,THANKS MASSIVELY. WHICH TRACKS HAVE BEEN REMOVED? I'M SURE IT'S NOT HARD FOR ANY OF US TO JUST COPY AND PASTE THE TRACKS INTO OTHER ALBUMS!!! THANKS AGAIN
,Plasmadude,2011-06-17T10:14Z,"Bitrate is 320 for the 5 albums i checked
Download took less than an hour.
thank you very, very  much.
this upload is indeed an example of excellence."
,OverlordAlexndr,2011-10-31T15:41Z,"Yeah, the torrent is great.

Although I Am disappointed a little bit of the band. Maybe because everyone was like: Alternative band, great band and stuff, so I was expecting a lot, and now I have lower opinion then they deserve. Meh...

Nevermind, thanks to canardon for a great quality upload, and thank you R.E.M for the music, but I dont promise I'll buy all you albums ;]"
