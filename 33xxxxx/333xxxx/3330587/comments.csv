,T0ker,2005-05-14T18:29Z,This work?
,mama,2005-05-14T20:20Z,"The program is sh*t. It just retouches the settings, ie. sets max. 1000 connections per download and max 1000 connection attempts. Nothing you can't do it by yourself. NOTE: Older Windows (like 98SE) CAN'T HANDLE 1000 connections per task, there's a global total (for all programs) of 100 connections available. Setting (like the software does) 1000/task means Windows freezes for every few seconds and you can't access the net (ie. www, email etc.) while using Bitcomet since you run out of connections...

Besides, the reg# doesn't work."

,Masolonicum,2006-02-06T21:09Z,"My computer turned out to be really funny, it freezes for a few seconds. Bitcomet doesn´t respond. Restarted bitcomet but it was fucked up. Uninstalled Activator and reinstalled bitcomet, now it works. Great for all you who got this thing working but for me it didn´t work at all..."
