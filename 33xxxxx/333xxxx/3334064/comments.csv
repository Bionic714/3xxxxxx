,SuperTank,2005-05-24T01:59Z,"I agree, one of the best episodes ever."
,MacattacKUK,2005-05-29T13:48Z,Stupid question I know but I can't extract the file. I just get an empty folder which has nothing in it inside the .rar file. What am I doing wrong?
,Redeemer,2005-05-31T23:50Z,"it says the runtime is 120 min. wich is 2 hours. when i play the file it's only 1h 24 min. is this because of the commercials that have been cutout, or is something wrong? could it really be over 30 min of commercials?"
,Phunjabi,2005-06-02T22:29Z,"MacattacKUK: Are you sure that you're using winrar? Try searching for winrar here at tbp and download the latest release.

Redeemer: The ""normal"" lenght of lost episodes are ~42min. 2 x 42min = 1h 24min ;D"
