,Lautsprecher,2005-05-16T21:18Z,"Why download this(~700MB), when you can download XPLite(~1,5MB)? If the removal of WFP is the ""big thing"" in this ""gold reloaded"" version, i really don't se the point of this release."
,Sir_N,2005-05-17T13:48Z,"Well my friend ""Lautsprecher"", don't u think just the name says it all...Lite is a light version, but this is a FULL version...WTF...go ahead, download and try it...It's all yours...free of charge..."

,rec,2005-05-22T17:59Z,"Look asshole... Either you tell us how to burn this crap or I label you an idiot!!

This garbage IS NOT BOOTABLE."
,cyberdiver,2005-06-10T13:37Z,"För att göra den bootabel kan man rippa den i nero genom att klicka på recorder, burn image, leta reda på ISO-filen och bränn. sätt sedan in den i datorn som ska ha den, och du har windows xp."
,sleech,2005-06-23T02:05Z,"someone tell me what to burn to disc ive my pc setup to boot from disc but un sure of which 1 to burn is the setup, that i burn?"
,prod,2005-07-14T09:13Z,"This is not bootable. It's just a big .rar file. 

Extract it all, and burn to CD.

I installed win98 SE first then used this to upgrade - works fine.

I've now got win98 and xp dual boot so i can play all my old dos games without dosbox :D"

,anshin,2006-01-15T14:39Z,Den blir inte bootbar om man unrarar och bränner ner den. Hur görs den bootbar?
,alvah,2006-03-03T12:12Z,"to get the "".rar"" bootable (its not a .rar, its an ISO) you download daemontools, and mount the ISO, daemontools is a tool thats opens ISO files and tricks the PC that's it is a cd-rom"
,pippincp,2006-04-18T16:52Z,"I cannot understand the adverse comments on this upload.
Yes it is bootable if you know how to write a disc.
Personally I think it it is a great u/l and all thanks to they who did it.
Don't slag off an uploader if you are too stupid to know how to use the prog YOU are the idiot!!!!!11
Works fine for me but the cd key included does not but I have a working one anyway.
All thanks to the uploader!"

,Gnarkill420,2007-01-10T11:25Z,Hey Nubs If this is an iso file than the noobiest (easy) way is to burn image file on nero WITH A CD NOT DVD and if this is the file i downloaded a long time ago (i think it is) than it works fine as a matter of fact im using it right now and have been for about a year. Ill repost and tell you if its the one after it finnishes d loading.
