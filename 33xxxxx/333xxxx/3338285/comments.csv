Oh what was that? ""LANGUAGE: ENGLISH""?

,deimos1337,2005-05-31T20:54Z,"is the tracker down?
:whistle: i'll just leave it over night and check again."
,n20,2005-05-31T22:37Z,someone convert this to mpeg or avi.. 
,StonerMan,2005-05-31T23:24Z,"Hey  n20.
Is it due to ignorance or laziness that you cant extract the  god damn files yourself?

I´m guessing a little bit of both. So here comes a quick guide.
Get a hold of ""Daemon Tools"" or ""Alchohol 120%""
Open up CTP-MA01.CUE with Daemon or Alc 120% and copy the AVSEQ02 file from the MPEG2 folder to your desktop or whatever.
AVSEQ01 is just the Centropy ""intro"" so you can skip that.

Then do the same thing with CTP-MA02.CUE and you´ll be good to go."
,n20,2005-06-01T00:22Z,"i tried extracting the mpg files it shows pixelated squares when i try to play.. 

btw im neither ignorant or lazy. you aint gotta be a dick about it."
,jinkssick,2005-06-01T03:07Z,"- GET vcdgear and convert BOTH bin files to mpeg. 

- watch BIN files with VLC MEDIA PLAYER

- extract from rar and burn bin with the cue file using nero's image function"
,cooniez,2005-06-01T03:11Z,Or you can just get ISOBuster and browse the files in the .bin and extract AVSEQ02 like that other guy said. It works like Winrar but for ISOs.
,Scomber,2005-06-01T06:30Z,"Bra att dom lägger in en bild som är komprimerad i dassigaste JPG kvaliteten jag sett på länge :P
Som tur var så ser exemplet mycket bättre ut på vcdquality. Tror denna release är mycket bra, men jag blev lite lurad av bilden..."
,siamak111,2005-06-01T07:25Z,works and has Good quality. *thumbs-up* 
,xzibit89,2005-06-01T14:07Z,Seeds? I only get 5KB/s Dn  :(
,Maegnas,2005-06-03T08:22Z,"I got it zipped and all, but what player do you guys use? The VCD is only for mac, I think, I can't open the inst. file anyway, what else is there to use?"
,r0ssc0,2005-06-03T20:09Z,Is this negud? yarrrrbinx

,raindog,2005-06-04T10:21Z,"Burn image files:
http://hem.bredband.net/hoqqe/cue/

This film will result in 2 CD:s - one for each image (CD1 and CD2)
When both CDs were created, I copied the MPEGS from the CDs to a temp directory (folder) on my harddrive.
Then  I started WinDVD and added both MPEGs to the playlist in WinDVD and enjoyed the film.

Good picture and sound quality, btw!!"
,raindog,2005-06-04T10:23Z,"regarding the second first and second part of the film:
You will have to rename the MPEG-files so the first part is selected first:
For example: MADA01.mpeg and MADA02.mpeg"

,Rick_Random,2005-06-04T23:22Z,"Got files extracted but need codecs. VLC, real, Bsplayer nor winmediaplayer can handle it :l Why all this ? Why not just the videofiles? "
,roonster,2005-06-05T01:08Z,thanks siamak .....all i needed to know...:O)
[V],Slickinator,2005-06-05T03:49Z,best codecs to get to play any movie is at  www.cole2k.net get the standard or advanced pack have a good one and enjoy
,Mightyice,2005-06-05T09:21Z,Anyone else having problem extracting this with ISO buster. get alot off errors. i can watch sample though?
,no_limit,2005-06-05T11:14Z,Why are the bin and cue bigger then the cd when it's mounted??
,Rick_Random,2005-06-05T11:39Z,"Extracted, installed codecs, got watchable video but the audio is horrible :l damn it "

why do i not get all the files.it stands 100 % but several of the files is unfinished. got 1.15 GB downloaded....How do i fix this..Do i have to download it again or what ?"
,gabbe_wine,2005-06-05T14:36Z,"jag kan inte få första cd att fungera det blir bara en kort film om centropy på 1,40 min vad hände med cd1 för cd2 fungkar utmärkt"
,Geroshabu,2005-06-05T18:42Z,"ikarusianco - sometimes CD 1 only plays one title track- in this case the centropy intro. You have to choose the second video track -- if using VLC then it's called ""title"" under controls. Just switch it after you start the movie."
,Rick_Random,2005-06-06T04:25Z,Got it finally working with vcdgear and bsplayer :l yay

,trancebc,2005-06-09T20:08Z,"STUPID ASS FORMAT, WHY CAN'T YOU MAKE IT MPG OR DIVX OR XVID OR SOMETHING MORE SIMPLER, WHY IT HAS TO BE STUPID SVCD WHERE YOU HAVE TO WASTE BUNCH OF TIME BY EXTRACTING & DECODING AND FINDING RIGHT GEAR TO PLAY THIS FILE PLUS YOU CAN NOT BURN IT ON NORMAL 700MB CD!!! WHAT IS THE POINT OF UPLOADING HUGE ASS FILLES THAN?! GRRRR STONERMAN YOU ARE AN IDIOT!!!"
,xforum,2005-06-10T00:12Z,AN SVCD IS AN MPEG2 FILE
,Sayun,2005-06-10T18:08Z,"Since when has SVCD been a pain? xvid and divx are codecs, not a format.."
,Sayun,2005-06-10T18:12Z,"Try to actually *know* anything, before telling people what's what. Also, try to not sound like an idiot when calling someone an idiot. Works much better that way."

IKARUSIANCO :: You rock! I never would have thought of that.

If you are using OSX and VLC Player change the 1st .BIN file to .AVI

,jebon1,2005-06-11T15:29Z,"first of all thx.for the great movie. i dl the files and spell cd1, cd2, sample and ctp-ma (amazing it took me 6 days in all). i can watch through vlc played but have to click the files one by one. 

can someone tell me how to patch those files into single play and how to burn it using nero 2 since nero cant detect the movie format as well. triy to do as instructed in here but not for my small brain. pls HELP>>>

thank you. regards. my kids is jumping mad......... cant wait to see. much oblidge.... "

,Bashar1975,2005-06-20T13:49Z,"i've downloaded""Madagascar""and unzipped it,i've got .bin and .cue files,i cant play them with windvd or with windows mediaplayer,so will u tell me please what should i do? many thanks"
,Achy,2005-06-20T17:46Z,"hey people, bin cue files its a kind of ISO format, u can burn it easily into a 700MB cd, all u need its Nero, Alcohol, clone cd,....., etc, in Nero u have to ckick in ""Disc Image or Project Saved"" and thats all, it fits in a 700MB cd"
,Sui-Iuris,2005-06-21T19:27Z,Get VLC media player (free). All you have to do is drag the bin file to the player and voila...
,lleb,2005-06-23T06:34Z,"for those who are not in the know a .bin/.cue combo is ONLY used in windows, no other OS can access it.  sorry but i refuse to run windows on ANY of my computers.  forget the compression and just leave things as their default .avi, .VOB, or better yet just convert them into a more universal standard .iso or .img

i can not use, nor will i use windows again."
,green_eyes,2005-06-25T13:36Z,there is no picture i only here sound
,green_eyes,2005-06-25T14:02Z,please help me
,zubutix,2005-06-25T16:22Z,TranceBC: Bin files DO fit on a 700mb disc. You just burn it as a bin file and start the burn with the CUE file if its there otherwise just set NERO to IMAGE burn and go.
,sajbermosart,2005-06-25T21:32Z,seed ffs
,yellowkitten,2005-06-26T00:44Z,Great movie. Plays great on VLC. Thanx a bunch!
,covenant_uk,2005-06-26T15:45Z,"Lieb: That is just so inaccurate. bin/cues are not necessarily Windows only. If they were, then how do you explain the fact that I can directly view/play bin files with mplayer under Linux, not to mention burn them using k3b (agin in Linux), utilising the associated cuesheets?"
,lane0185,2005-06-27T01:22Z,lleb you can mount bin/cue images in the mac os x operating system and play them back as well.  I think you are mistaken with your statement that these images are a Windows only format.
,atarilover,2005-07-07T01:09Z,"if you don't know how to drop bin/cue files to cd/dvd, then why are you here?"
,atarilover,2005-07-07T01:10Z,and divx is an mpeg4 format- asses!
