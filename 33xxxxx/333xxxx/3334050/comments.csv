Of course not! They were certainly honest about one thing, it does ""feature"" ""Rock and Roll All Night"", ""Shout it Out Loud"", ""God of Thunder"", and ""Love Gun"", but that is ALL it frigging features! All 19 minutes worth."

,kissedtokill,2007-02-01T13:17Z,"THIS IS THE BIGGEST BULLSHIT DOWNLOAD EVER. NOT ONLY IS IT A 19 MINUTE SHOW... IT WAS ALSO LIPSYNCD. YES THEY WERE NOT REALY PLAYING IT WAS A BACK UP TAPE. THIS WAS FILMED BREIFLEY IN BETWEEN THE FILMING OF DETROIT ROCK CITY AND PAULS LITTLE STINT IN PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. THEY CHOSE NOT TO REALY PLAY SO THAT PUAL COULD SAVE HIS VOICE FOR HE DEMANDING VOCALS HE HAD TO SING IN PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. 
PLEASE SAVE YOUR DOWNLOAD FOR A BETTER KISS SHOW. THIS IS JUST BULLSHIT!!"
