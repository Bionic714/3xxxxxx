,Marreboy,2005-05-21T22:06Z,Interesting that someone has rated this at 2 stars.. since noone has more than 25% downloaded yet...
,Christos_one,2005-05-22T01:25Z,nån som kan ta hem denna o lägga SWE subs på den så skulle det vara guld värt
,buchanan,2005-05-22T14:10Z,marreboy..do you think piratebay is the firste torrentsite to put out this movie..it's the last!! downloaded this for a couple days ago..
,Toyster,2005-05-22T23:22Z,"Buchanan: Good point, but more importantly........Is the quality only worth 2 stars?"
,buchanan,2005-05-23T15:26Z,toyster..yes..the sound doesen't sync..but the picture is great on this one..
,buchanan,2005-05-23T15:27Z,"I downloaded this, Sahara.WS.DVDSCR.DVDR-TEG-DVD 
..so it would be the same.."
,Toyster,2005-05-23T23:03Z,"Yes, you are right. The sound is out of sync a little. But enough to be anoying! I wish I knew before.....Picture is great, so 2 stars from me too."
