Alright here is a German TV special on the European 2001 Destruction tour. This is in English except for the Beatsteaks interview, i left it in for all those who speak german, and for those that don't its not long and you can always fast forward. This has small interviews and a live song from each band except the Beatsteaks whose singer joins with Penny wise doing a Ramones track, enjoy!

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.         http://www.videolan.org/
