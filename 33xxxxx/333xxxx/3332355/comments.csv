,ZeDDoN,2005-05-18T07:05Z,"Unfortunately the Fluf-version isn't available here at PB...

By the way...is there any movie that anyone feels they want to see here at PB? Yeah....I'm doing requests.... ;)

Just write a comment to this torrent and I will see what I can do about it....

,phonetik,2005-05-20T01:03Z,"Millers Crossing
The Hudsucker proxy
Fargo

All by the brilliant Cohen brothers
That would rock my world as I only have (had) them on VHS :D"
,phonetik,2005-05-20T01:05Z,"oh - and by the way: ""Barton Fink""  ;)"
,ZeDDoN,2005-05-21T01:30Z,"Hey hey hey you guys... ;)

Go easy on me now....I'm pretty much a rookie at this....*lol*

But I have the requests noted and will be searching for them for you....perhaps if you find them you can report it so I can stop searching?? ;)

Have a blast!!

,ZeDDoN,2005-05-24T02:02Z,"Darn....

Someone beat me to it...

I've been working on ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" for a while now and just when I was going to put it up I found http://www.piratebay.org/torrents-details.php?id=3334676&hit=1 and thought that it would be just unnecessary for me to add that film to the files...

So if you want the Tiger....go get it... ;)

This movie!!! 
I've been desperately seeking for this movie for ages! I'm not into romance movies, but ""before sunrise"" is one of the best movies I've seen. That's why I'm eagerly waiting to see the sequel..

Thank you!"
