And personally I don't care much for the rest of it, so won't even go and buy 'em."
,evandar1,2005-06-14T18:55Z,"P.g.a att Tracker e messed up, så går de inte att hitta disc 3 (dvs. följande disc i serien) genom att söka på kategori -Video-. Av någon anledning har den  hamnat i kategori -ingenting-. Sök alltså på Kategori -Alla- för att hitta episodes 9 - 12. "
,Geitekaas,2005-07-31T09:46Z,"These are the 1978 series..
The series on Earth are the 1980 series.
Am I right?"
,Consider-Phlebas,2005-08-05T18:55Z,"I think you're right.

Burned this to CD as a data copy, worked like a charm. Nice work, thanks!

Now we only have to get the others to disk ;-)"
,Consider-Phlebas,2005-08-05T18:55Z,Hrmm. CD -> DVD of course...
,evandar1,2005-08-05T21:18Z,"Ok, problem with tracker again. It's reporting the torrent incorrectly. I've uploaded the last disc, disc6, but tracker reports it as a copy of last torrent, so, you guys wanting Galactica last disc, try the other torrent which says eps 17-20. It's really the last disc with Ep's 21-24. I checked the files to be sure, and the rar-files are Ep's 21-24. "
,Consider-Phlebas,2005-08-08T22:38Z,"Episodes 17+ are a bit down on my download list, but the rar archive names in torrents named 17-20 as well as 21-24 are correct (matches episode #s, so things look OK? Do I still need to change something? Perhaps you're client SW is not showing what's really on the server, evandar1? Thanks anyway for all your work."
,evandar1,2005-08-10T01:06Z,"I went and deleted the faulty torrent and uploaded it again, and this time the tracker got it right ...

So now everything is ok with ep's 21-24."
