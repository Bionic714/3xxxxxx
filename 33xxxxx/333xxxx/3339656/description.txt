This is a wonderful and authoritative  documentary by PBS on the Islamic religion, empire, and historic civilization. It is part of the PBS Empires series.

Encoded in DivX, it includes:

2 files for the main documentary (2:30 long roughly)
2 files for the extras (the making of... and islamic architecture)

Finally, this is a chance to present another side of Arabs and Islam then the one that Christian Fascists like Jerry Falwell present!
