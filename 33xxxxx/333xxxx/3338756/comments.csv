love this film!"
,Epidemical,2005-06-03T09:08Z,"Well, they're different sizes so they're obviously different somehow. This is directly from Nineteen.Eighty.Four.1984.DVDRip.XviD-AEN, you'll have to ask the other uploader what his source is."
,Epidemical,2005-06-03T09:12Z,I just saw in the comments to that torrent that it's missing the last 15 minutes - This is the full version.
