,justtoking,2011-03-03T18:56Z,"Hi Stunter :-) How's it goin'?

I doubt you'll ever read this note (because it's been 6 years since you first uploaded this file) but it sure would be nice if you (or anyone else who happens to have a complete copy of this file) would be so kind as to re-seed it (because it seems to be permanently stuck at 72.9%).

I know, I know, it's just a Clip Show (just like the ""Best of Sr. vs. Jr."" and ""Best of Michael Teutel"" Clip Shows) but still, I really would like to see this Season 1 Mikey Clip Show.

This file is the only episode of American Choppers that I haven't seen yet. I hope to have the chance to see this episode someday.

Well, I'll close this overly lengthy note with a song from Bob Marley:
Thank you (sharers) for what you've done for me.
Thank you (sharers) for what you're doing now.
Thank you (sharers) for every little thing.
Thank you (sharers) for you make me sing. :-)



TL:DR
Simply trying to say ""Please seed."""
