,thebc,2005-06-14T23:15Z,"i'm trying to identify particular episode, so i can dl it and to hear the music/sndtrk in it.  all i remember is at the end of the ep, the bad guy, an artist, burns his paintings in his empty swimming pool, and when vice shows up, the paintings are already burning.  maybe something voodoo-ish in the theme, can't recall very well.  thx for any help i can get.  online ep guides haven't helped.  peace"
