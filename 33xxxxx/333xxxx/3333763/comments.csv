Then you can watch it in i DVD-player."
,trudelutt,2005-05-23T22:10Z,"Yes, thank you for the nice IMAX releases! 
A tip for those a little more advanced users: Reauthor these IMAX releases in for example DVDShrink, and you can create one DVD image with two movies on it. (uncompressed since they are quite small...)"
