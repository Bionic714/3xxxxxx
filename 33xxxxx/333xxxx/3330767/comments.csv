,gregorius,2005-06-30T22:15Z,"ok...what do you say about the pentagon 'plane'? the ""mystery explosion"" is just one little thing between many! it's always the same: you show 25 aspects and one single is wrong and even if you publish you were wrong about that point (like they did: http://www.911inplanesite.com/media/mystery_explosion_solved_med.wmv   ) but people tell you that EVERYTHING was wrong...for me the first story about the pentagon plane was the one that is enough to make clear there was something very very wrong!! But i understand that, for american people, this cannot be the truth because it it would be, everything they did after would become even more wrong as it already is..."
