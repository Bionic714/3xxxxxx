,mikeattacks,2005-05-16T19:09Z,"You're welcome!
This is also one of my favorite Japanese movies."
,aM1bEK,2005-05-18T12:16Z,"Indeed very strong film. Also as I would love to see 

Onibaba (The Demon) (1964)
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058430/"
,aM1bEK,2005-05-21T21:17Z,"Too bad about ""Onibaba"". Well... maybe you'll reconsider... :)
This movie is just incredible."
,bt72hw,2005-05-22T11:41Z,"I applaud the comments from miike regarding the Criterion Collection - thier titles are best purchased, and prefrably purchased New instead of Used so that the sales are reported back to the distributor(s) etc.  

And the Onibaba Crit. edition is what miike claims, if not more. I would recomend the Crit. editions of all Kurosawa and Wes Anderson films too!"
,malco23,2005-06-27T14:48Z,Thanks for this. How about seeding some more cool flicks?
,kevinspencer01,2006-10-15T17:03Z,"This is a great up, thanks, mikeattacks! Could someone please re-seed this? Although the tracker doesn't show it, there's still a few people on this. Please have mercy on us. Thanks a million!"
,patias,2008-08-09T12:19Z,"Hi, could someone pleeeeaseee seed again this film again??? "
,guacamolewilson,2009-05-15T21:48Z,Been at 96% for weeks now. Anyone care to lend a hand for those last few megs? I'll keep on seeding after.
