Ripper Notes 

One of my favorite Japanese art/new wave flicks from the late 60s/early 70s. A real mindblowing visual and mental experience, with some really twisted sick moments. Yasuzo Masumura crafted a timeless masterpiece with this movie, one of those movies which was so ahead of its time that it still retains its freshness all these years.
