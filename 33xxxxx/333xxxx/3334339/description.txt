As skateboarding begins to embrace the importance of it's own short history, Plan B's second release, Virtual Reality, quickly establishes itself as one of skateboarding's most significant video productions of all time. Only one year after their inaugural release (Questionable Video 1992), Plan B stepped to the fold under the guidance of Mike Ternasky and convincingly shrugged off the sophomore video jinx. In today's massive era of skate prominence, Virtual Reality remains a flick that's just as significant for its representation of the period's form and style, as it is for the bar raising development and progression that it depicts.
