,uberherr90210,2008-12-19T12:06Z,"For subtitles, you need to have the .srt files in the same folder as the video itself (in this case, the .avi files, but for others they may be .mpg or .mpeg or whatever). When it loads the movie, it looks in the same folder for certain things, like .srt's. I use Media Player Classic, but as far as I know that's how it works for all video players.

If you're interested in how they work, the .srt is basically a text file that has times listed for when strings of words are supposed to be displayed on screen."
