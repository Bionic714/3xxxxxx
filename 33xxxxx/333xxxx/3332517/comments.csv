I do not understand why I should include any black borders (they do not enhance the watching experience, do they?), so I removed them. Is modifying the movie considered very rude? First time I seed a movie, so I don't know :)"
,joakimar,2005-05-26T17:38Z,"Borders that are black the entire length of the movie are a bug. And we're doing a recompression anyway, so removing them when we have the chance is good.

,Erica15jr,2006-09-30T00:23Z,"Sorry, that's the second movie of the lord of the rings. This movie becomes downloaded very slow, but I can already see the movie on my pc. It's now on 96%. Seed it please!"
,Erica15jr,2006-10-01T11:58Z,"I can't burn this on a dvd, cause when the first file is ready (you can't burn it as if it's 1 file) teh other won't start. And then the dvd is still empty."
