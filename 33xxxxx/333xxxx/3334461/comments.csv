,DaMixxMaster,2005-05-22T11:09Z,Dude...WTF is with the missing ending???? PLEASE don't do this to us! A WARNING TO THOSE DOWNLOADING...THIS IS MISSING THE ENDING CREDITS AS WELL AS TEASER FOR NEXT WEEKS EPISODE! Us Doctor Who fans DEMAND better quality than this. We are not like other Sci-Fi fans!!!
,DaMixxMaster,2005-05-22T11:10Z,"yes, that was harsh. BUT it was deserved. If a file is missing something, it should be stated in the details, so people won't waste time downloading an INCOMPLETE file!"
,ivanhoho1,2005-05-22T20:40Z,nah... man. its all about the actual show. who cares who the leading film director was or w/ever. and its not like your gonna make a desicion about watching the next weeks episode from the trailer for it... you know your gonna watch it even if it did suck (heaven forbid though)
,warpoc_muse,2005-05-23T03:28Z,"Christ!!
Normally I would include the teaser, but in this nights showing the BBC ran the entire credits before, opening a new scene, giving info about something, then going on to the teaser....and I'm sorry, but I'm buggered if I'm going to piss about, chopping and merging for the sodding teaser, when as was rightly said, you're probably watch it anyway.
I think people would rather have the torrent as quickly as possible"
,Girkers,2005-05-24T14:28Z,"I agree about getting the torrent as quick as possible, but I pose the question that a torrent of the same program with the Credits and Teaser, that is the same quality as yours, why is it smaller?"
,warpoc_muse,2005-05-28T19:04Z,"I dunno,
could be a number of reasons, different screen sizes, higher rate audio, newer/older codecs...
I release to a private tracker site mainly, this is the size I started the series on and I've stuck to it, I only upped on here because I felt I wanted to give something back to Pirate Bay for all the stuff I've had in the past

its a love thing :-)"
