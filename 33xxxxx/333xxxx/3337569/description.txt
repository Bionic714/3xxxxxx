This is my personal collection of solo rarities. Many on never released cassettes. All studio albums have full art. Detailed info on word doc included with d/l. Please reseed as it took years to collect, much is UNIQUE, & it took a while to come up with this. If I have to switch pc off I will come back frequently so keep it queued. Oh yeah & let us know what you think. No boring later stuff here.
