I would have asked you to upload some of this treasure in lossless format on dimeadozen.org.  . but somebody in the Hawkwind camp has asked them not to allow torrents by that  band there. Strange, to me that sounds totally opposed to the Hawkwind spirit.
Still, if you were to up FLAC torrents of this stuff here, I'm sure you would find plenty of takers.
Thanks for your efforts."

Thanks again."
