PLOT

After a horrible boating accident kills her family, Angela, a shy and sullen 
young girl, moves in with her eccentric aunt Martha, alongside her protective 
cousin Ricky. One summer, Martha sends the kids to Camp Arawak. Soon after their
arrival, a series of bizarre and increasingly violent accidents begins to claim 
the lives of various campers. Who is the twisted individual behind these murders? 
The disclosure of the murderer's identity is the  most shocking climax in the 
history of American cinema.
