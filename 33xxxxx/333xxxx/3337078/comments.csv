,jegg,2009-10-22T18:59Z,"How should the movies and this TV-series be watched in a logical order (not the release order)?

My best guess is:

Highlander 1
Highlander 3
Highlander the TV series
Highlandetr 4: Endgame

But then I am not sure where HL2 and HL5 (supposed to be extremely bad) fit in.

Anyone who have seen it all and have any views?"
,jegg,2009-10-22T19:00Z,"BTW:

A torrent that has been around for 4.5 years and still has seeders can't be all that bad.

Thanks for the effort alert101!"
,ladyzman1403,2009-12-15T23:48Z,really bad download not worth downloading nice try though
