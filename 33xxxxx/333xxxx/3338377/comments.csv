,chigga102,2007-11-05T02:43Z,its for visual C++ which is for basically MFC or microsoft foundation classes. this will not teach C++ but will teach GUI with mfc
,wetmouse,2010-03-14T17:37Z,"So basically it will teach you Visual C++ (just like the title says) and that means you'll be able to write programs for 95% of the world's computers (MFC/Windows). Thanks for the warning, chigga102, I nearly made the mistake of downloading it!"
