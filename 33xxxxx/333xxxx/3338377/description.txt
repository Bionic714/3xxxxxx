This torrent contains the Keystone Learning Videos for Visual C++ on six or seven CD's in an Archive-file, I don't remember right at the moment..

I found it to be an excellent tool for catching up after beeing away from programming-languages for twelve years myself, concidering how the programming has changed to be Object-oriented nowadays.

Hope anyone else can find a good use for this.
