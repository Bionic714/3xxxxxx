Movie description 
Four seasoned comic actors shine in this wacky tale of a day that starts out badly and quickly devolves into outright catastrophe. Matt Dillon plays a handsome thirty-something Joe who seems to have it all--a lovely blond fiancee (MARRIED WITH CHILDREN's Christina Applegate) and a high paying job at a bank. In one morning however, he is dually dumped--by both his girlfriend and his boss. 

Note: this is not a romantic comedy, but a slightly darker sort of tale, yet entertaining. The feeling of this film reminded me of a favourite of mine: "Kill me later". I edited the description above as it was part faulty, part spoiler.
