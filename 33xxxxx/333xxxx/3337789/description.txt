Review:
Derren Brown produced a 6-part series in which he deceived the public and celebrities with his psychological, mind-reading and memory skills. Some of the stuff he pulled off in the series is mindblowing. He worked out where a penalty-shooter will kick the ball into a goal, what a psychiatrist is thinking before he thinks it, and even drawn an elaborate building entirely from memory. The series also includes celebrities such as Stephen Fry and Martin Kemp.
