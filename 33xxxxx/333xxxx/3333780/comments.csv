IMDB says language = Spanish / English.
As a non-Spanish speaker, can I watch the film?  Are there English subs?
Thanks in advance"
,speakeasy,2005-05-21T02:40Z,"After a bit or research, I'm guessing it's mostly spoken in Spanish with hard English subs."
,Temptation,2005-05-21T07:38Z,I have the same question... does this have english subs? I don't want to download a 700MB file and find I can't watch it.. could the uploader please tell us? Thanks.
