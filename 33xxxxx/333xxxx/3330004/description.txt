   After two successful EP's ( "Disappear !" and "No Pulse" ) and
   several appearances on high-profile compilations, the time has come
   for Glis to reveal their much anticipated 14 track 4th album !
   "Nemesis" finds Glis following the successfull EBM / future pop
   formula of "Balance" and "Equilibrium" with an altogether darker
   album utilising harsher distorted vocals together with a brooding
   industrial edge alongside Glis' modern and club-oriented sound.
   "Nemesis" also boast a number of high profile guest appearances
   including FRONT 242's frontman Jean-Luc De Meyer contributing guest
   vocals on the tracks "The Irreparable" and "La B?atrice" with
   adapted lyrics from Charles Baudelaire's "Flowers Of Evil".
