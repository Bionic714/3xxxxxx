,ambsimona,2005-05-16T16:04Z,"Thanks for the series,I'm a big fan!!!Can you tell me the quality of the files!!I guess serie 01 is a dvdrip but the rest...???"
,Porrfarfar,2005-05-20T13:41Z,"Yeah... this is an 端bersweet posting but i agree; can you say something about the quality before we begin downloading this monster?

Btw, NX=one of the best shows ever. "
,jezbo,2005-05-20T14:25Z,"So happy this is out, I havent been able to get hold of anything past season two before. Now I just need to free up 22Gb of my hard drive! 

Keep seeding please people, so that we can all share in the magic that is Cicely Alaska."
,jezbo,2005-05-21T08:56Z,"I downloaded the first two episodes from series 3 and they appear to be TV rips from ITV2 - a little grainy as you would expect but perfectly watchable, sound seems to be in stereo as far as I can tell and while not crystal clear it's not bad at all. Good job !"
,ambsimona,2005-05-22T10:45Z,"ok guys,I'll free up some gb and start dw"
,webserver,2005-05-30T04:09Z,can someone plz seed this
,Morri_s,2005-06-13T01:27Z,"Very nice, keep seeding please. This will do until the rest of the seasons is out on DVD (crosses fingers). 

Also, what is the general quality on the episodes?"
,1520,2005-06-28T12:37Z,Can someone PLEASE re seed this. It just doesnt seem to keep running. I am uploading faster than i am downloading. I dont mind this . It is nice to give something back. I just love this show and this torrent is the only way I will ever get to see all the episodes. Thanks :) 
,lorenzo_K,2006-02-27T23:51Z,"one of the best, if not THE BEST(!), feel good tv-series ever made!

THANK YOU Memorabilia & everyone else that's helpin out with the seedin!"
,Veinkein,2006-05-24T09:46Z,"Hello!I have downloaded this piece of Art i have to inform you that some are good in quality and some are pretty bad cause they are TV rips but it deserves the waiting.If you haven't seen the series till the end and you really loved the series see those episodes until ""the quest""!For The last seven just press delete!Not for the quality but for the scenery!"
,_Seth_,2006-07-01T19:46Z,"Its fully watchable, Episodes; some good & some less good in quality. I just hate it when Joel returns to New York, and is replaced with that idiot Phil Capra. It just ruins the series.. The magic touch just goes away.  Anyway, it is worth waiting for this big download to finish!!!!!! :-)"
,slicer_05,2006-08-13T10:34Z,"Is there anyone who has the soundtracks to rip and share?
It would be super great. :D"
,imtheworm,2006-10-23T11:45Z,Season one is good but the rest are off the t.v. some even have subtitles.
,solar_power,2006-11-13T06:43Z,i love this show... please more seeders.. the tv quaility ones will be fine.. since they have original audio.. Universal Pictures didn't relicense the same songs.. lame.. but i'm excited to see these!!! seeders please!
,surferonsinewaves,2008-02-21T16:51Z,"any new seeds?  this is still an amazing torrent, please keep it alive."
,phishneslo,2008-03-15T21:04Z,I have been downloading for weeks.  Can people please seed a little more?  I have been upping at 100kb but only getting about 10 back...
,Kilde,2008-08-04T10:50Z,"The quality varies and is generally not as good as other TV shows out there, but all episodes are watchable.  Some have quirks like subtitles in foreign languages.  DVD rips would definitely be nicer on the eyes, but the benefit of the TV rips is that all the episodes will have the original soundtracks for the episodes.  The DVD releases had to relicense music, so I find this torrent to be the purest northern exposure experience."
,SinceEBCDIC,2009-01-27T02:33Z,"Thanks for an awesome offering. Sadly, I don't see the s/l 21/103 numbers reported here; generally I'm nibbling bytes at a time from one person. I've been downloading this full-time for over two months thus far!

The few episodes I've seen thus far have transported me back to the days when we waited all week for NX to appear. Thanks!"
,jasonwentcrazy,2009-03-18T03:12Z,I'm pleased to hear that these are TV rips and really feel like the original music absolutely makes up for any lesser video quality. I cannot imagine the series without the amazing original soundtrack. - I've been steadily working on this massive thing for months too. And I'll keep working and keep seeding. Cheers!
,montywolf,2009-04-10T17:13Z,"this torrent saddens me!

only the first season is a dvd rip; the rest are very low quality, time compressed recordings from broadcast television.  i should have known when the files sizes started getting smaller!"
,OrpheusDude,2009-06-16T10:26Z,"First of all THANK YOU to Memorabilia for this incredible download.  It took me about two weeks exactly to get it all, and that was with other downloads going on, and some interruptions in my Internet connection.

I don't understand the complaints about quality. Some seasons are sharper and clearer than others, but they come from a variety of sources: some are NTSC, some are PAL.  But all of the episodes are about 358 KB each.  There are no subtitles, or any TV station identifier markings, and all are in stereo (I am pumping them through a 5.1 sound system, and can definitely vouch that they are in stereo!).

I am in the process of transferring all six seasons from avi files to DVD (I am midway through Season Five at the moment) - a total of 28 DVDs - but they look great on my TV (flatscreen, 77 cm).  When the picture has large sections of black, you can see some pixels, but overall, the quality is pretty damned good!"
,OrpheusDude,2009-06-16T10:42Z,"Of course I meant to say that each episode is about 358 MB, not KB!  Considering that the vast majority of complete movies in avi format available through The Pirate Bay run 700 MB, and that a single episode of ""Northern Exposure"" is about 45 minutes, the quality is much the same."
,Iron_Yuppie,2011-05-06T09:23Z,Can someone clarify if all of these episodes are TV rips? I'd like the original songs for every episode is all.
