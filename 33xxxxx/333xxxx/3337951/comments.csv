go here http://dvd-rb.dvd2go.org/ and get rebuilder v0.91 and use the freeware HC encoder found in the download section, it's just as good as the CCE encoder"
,Marreboy,2005-05-30T21:43Z,Never claimed that these are new. But these i have tested and used so i know it works with great quality. So the choice is yours to shop around for all the latest tools and cracks and whatever or use this that works direct.
,PDG,2005-05-31T00:51Z,"Why bother when DvdShrink does the trick by itself if youve got NERO installed :)

If you like the movie *BUY IT*

I only buy my movies myselve and because i newer lend out my originals i make a copy of them to my nearest friends :)

Support the makers of the movies so they can make new and hopefully better ones :)"
,Morphen,2005-05-31T07:01Z,"Buy a movie?
Is it possible?
A tought it was a myth!

:fun:"

The link I posted is the official homepage, with HC encoder you don't need any cracks to anything. All the progs you need/get are freeware! And between v0.56 and 0.91 is like 2000 bugfixes and new features.. But the guide might still be useful :)

but speaking of cracks, for low bitrate encoding Canopus ProCoder 2 is well worth a try"
,a0rta,2005-06-03T02:44Z,How long time does it take to encode/decode/burn etc. a DVD with theese programs compared to DVDshrink? I only got a pretty old computer at the moment (PIII 700 Mhz) and it takes loong time enough with DVDshrink I think.
,ghettogreg,2005-06-03T22:22Z,"a0rta, I wouldn't use CCE encoder with your comp. I have a fairly new amd64 3400+ processor that runs pretty fast. Doing more than 5 passes of encoding with this program takes me well over 6 hours total while DVD Shrink barely takes 1/2 hour. Just my 02 cents"
,AntiJw,2005-06-03T23:23Z,"Beom: Canopus ProCoder 2 had a rather blurry picture compared to CinemaCraft Encoder SP v2.67.00.27 (6 passes) (when I transcoded Braveheart).
The only negative with CCE is that it had some artifacts in one scene (blue/green scene).
Didn't try ""One pass VBR"" with CCE though."
,AntiJw,2005-06-03T23:31Z,"a0rta: If you continue to use www.dvdshrink.org, use mode: ""Deep Analyser"" and H.Q. Adaptive error compensation -Sharp (default). Or else the picture-quality gets rather blurry.
Remove: trailers, other extras, menu(if it takes much MB), and plz remove audio that isn't the original language of the film.
Don't remove subtitles, they only take about 5 MB/each."
,haggvik,2005-06-04T15:39Z,"What the fuck, this one is working great, CCE rulez! And this one was the first version of it that worked for me :P"
,Najky,2005-06-18T14:27Z,"Or, you do it like me.
You take the original DVD and insert it. Start DVD Decrypter and tranfer the DVD to your harddrive in ""file"" format.
Once you've done that you have two options:
1. If the DVD is larger than a normal DVD5 you open the VIDEO_TS folder with VobBlanker. Remove the extra materials if you wish, and make the menues view ""still pictures"". Remove other things you don't like...
After you've done that you may open the newly made VIDEO_TS folder with DVD Shrink (no, the quality not bad when you encode with DVD Shrink...), strip subs and audio and then you have a nice DVD5 with GREAT quality.
2. If it's a DVD5 from the start, when burn the shit."
,ccclaudius,2005-06-22T10:37Z,"Thnx marre, the package I was looking for!"
,haggvik,2005-06-22T15:55Z,"Najky: If you compress a movie with DVDshrink to much (like 60 % or less) so you really can see difference if ypu have a big TV, and the sound gets worser too with DVDshrink. If thats the case, so this stuff is much better."
,haac,2006-05-01T18:16Z,"Hi,
I f**ked up , when setting the path to CCE.
I set, by mistake, the path for CCE SP 2.50 and could not delete it. Then I also set the path to CCE SP (New).
But Rebuilder tells me, when it starts phase II, 'No path to CCE has been set. Use menu/options to configure'.
How do I solve this...?
Regards"
