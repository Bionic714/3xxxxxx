Editorial reviews 
Included in Wire Magazine's 50 Records Of The Year ['99]
The Wire  (01/01/2000)

...intricately digitised slivers of sound....Hassell has dumped digital and gone analogue with a fervor that makes Paul's conversion on the road to Damascus look about as meaningful and intense as the Pepsi Challenge.
The Wire  (07/01/1999)

...largely [avoids] mixing jazz and electronica...a surprise, because [Hassell's] post-Miles Davis style electro-trumpeting has been probing jazz futures for decades....Any techno outfit with a horn owes him a drink.
Spin  (10/01/1999)
