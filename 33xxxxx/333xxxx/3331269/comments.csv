In Western Europe born and raised,
At the theater room where I spent most of my days,
Planning, plotting, and acting all cool,
And all shootin' some traitors to instill fear in the fools,
When a couple of Allies who were up to no good
Started running forces through our neck of the woods,
We lost a couple of little fights and my generals got scared,
They said ""You're moving with your cabinet to the bunkers down there""

I waited for my escorts and when they came near,
The jeeps had troops and guns in the rear,
If anything I thought this protection was rare,
But I said ""Nah forget it, yo home to down there!""

I pulled up to the elevator at about seven or eight,
And yelled to the guys ""Yo troops, your medals come later""
I looked at my bunker, I was finally there,
To settle my defeat as I breathed in stale air. "

NOW THIS IS A STORY ALL ABOUT HOW
IRAQ GOT FLIPPED TURNED UPSIDE DOWN
AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MINUTE SO JUST SIT TIGHT
I'LL TELL YOU HOW I GOT HANGED AT 10 PM JUST LAST NIGHT.

IN THE BLEAK IRAQI DESERT I WAS BORN AND RAISED
STARTIN' CONFLICTS IS HOW I SPENT MOST OF MY DAYS
INVADIN', DICTATIN', KILLIN' PEOPLE ALL COOL
AND SHOOTIN' SON-IN-LAWS RIGHT OUTSIDE OF THEIR SCHOOLS
WHEN GEORGE W. BUSH THOUGHT I WAS UP TO NO GOOD
AND STARTED MAKIN' TROUBLE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD
SO I HID IN MY HOLE UNTIL THEY FOUND ME AND SAID
""PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR OR WE'LL SHOOT YOUR ASS DEAD.""

THEY WHISTLED FOR A JUDGE AND WHEN HE CAME NEAR
THEY THREW ME IN A CELL AND HE SAID I WAS A QUEER
THEY KEPT ME IN PRISON, I DIDN'T GET A FREE PASS
AND SOON I WAS ON TRIAL FOR KILLING PEOPLE WITH GAS.

THEY. SAID. I HAD DISPERSED BIOWEAPONS EVERYWHERE
AS I YELLED TO THE KURDS ""YO HOMES, HOW 'BOUT THAT AIR?""
I LOOKED AT MY NOOSE, AND IT WAS EASY TO TELL
I'D SOON BE FLYIN' FIRST CLASS, DIRECTLY DOWN INTO HELL. "

HI, I'M GEORGE ZIMMER, FOUNDER AND CEO OF THE MEN'S WAREHOUSE.

NOW THIS IS THE STORY ALL ABOUT HOW
EVERY PERSON IN THIS WORLD CAN'T RESIST MY PLOW
AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MINUTE TO TALK ABOUT MY KIT
YOU'LL LIKE THE WAY IT LOOKS...I GUARANTEE IT.

IN NEW YORK CITY, BORN AND RAISED
POLISHING MY PISTOL'S HOW I SPENT MY DAYS
FINGERING, TINKERING, TOUCHING UP MY TOOL
CLEANING IT AND MAKING ALL THE LOVELY LADIES DROOL
WHEN SUPERMAN FELL FROM THE SKIES ABOVE, SAID,
""I CAN PWN YOUR PURPLE-HELMETED WARRIOR OF LOVE"".
SO I GAVE HIM A TASTE OF MY PILE-DRIVING PLEXUS AND REALIZED,
""I SHOULD MAKE MEN'S SUITS IN TEXAS"".

I HAILED FOR A CAB AND WHEN IT CAME NEAR
IT HAD A STICKER THAT SAID ""OBJECTS SMALLER IN MIRROR"".
SAID I TO THE CABBIE ""I CAN PROVE THAT WRONG!""
SO I SHOWED THE GOOD SIR MY SIZEABLE SCHLONG
IT VERILY WAS A SIGHT THAT HE JUST COULDN'T QUIT
AND THAT'S WHEN I FIRST PROCLAIMED, ""I GUARANTEE IT!""

I PULLED UP TO MY MANSION WITH A TRUCK OF WOMEN
AND GAVE THEM ALL A TASTE OF MY OMNIPOTENT SEMEN
LOOKED AT MY KINGDOM AND KNEW I WOULD FIT
AND THAT'S HOW I CAME TO SAY, ""I GUARANTEE IT"". "

Well this is a story all about how
my ship got flip-turned upside down
I'd like to take a minute just sit there plain.
I'll tell you how I lost a pod in a region called Domain.

In West Chaven born and raised
in the roid fields was how i spent most of my days.
Chillin out minin strippin all cool
jacking some 1k rats outside near my school.

When a couple of newbs who were up to no good,
started jacking canisters in my neighborhood,
I shot 1 little round and his corp got scared and said
""We're blowing up your can and your little plane.""

I whistled for some Help and when it came near
the license plate said CONCORD and they did nothing in here.
I could have said that lack of help was rare
but I thought ""Nah that's Eve, yo holmes they're over there!""

I got back in a ship at about 7 or 8
and I yelled to my corpmate ""Hey guys, check the Velator.""
Just an unlucky day, there was nothin to blame,
and that's how I lost a pod in Domain. "

Well this is a story all about how,
My kingdom got flip-turned upside down.
I'd like to take a minute please check Encarta,
I'll tell you how I died while defending Sparta.

In Sparta of Greece born and raised,
Ruling warriors was how I spent most of my days.
Chillin out, phalanxin, training all cool,
And killing giant wolves instead of school.

When a couple of Persians, who were up to no good,
Started bribin Senators in my neighborhood.
I killed one little messenger and they all got scared and said,
""We're not givin you soldiers, take your royal guard there.""

I whistled for a legion and when it came near,
There was only a couple Greeks and some Thespians here,
If anything I could say that doom awaits,
But I thought, ""Nah, forget it, yo Spartans to the hot gates.""

We fought Persian waves, about 7 or 8,
And I heard from my allies, ""Its an honor, Leonidas"",
Looked at Xerxes, there was no way outta this,
""We'll see your trooops soon, at Salamis."" "
