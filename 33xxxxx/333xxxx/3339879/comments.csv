,mwrzosek,2005-06-05T00:49Z,Good copies! Big thx! :) cya
,Daven,2005-06-05T01:06Z,"""You can tell
by the way the craft lands, the vibrations etc"" vibrations? What are they talking about?? Smells fake big time. "
,SuupaDuupa,2005-06-05T01:09Z,"This is not a fake one..I can confirm that because I have seen it..100% working so don't ruin this great release by calling it a fake when you don't even know anything..ok =)

Now let's take this one 2 the top"
,SuupaDuupa,2005-06-05T01:20Z,well..just don't download it..not so hard
,SuupaDuupa,2005-06-05T01:49Z,ok..the sample will be right up..
,jolly_roger,2005-06-05T01:56Z,This is the release. http://www.vcdreview.com/info.php/i-52725.html
,abilas,2005-06-05T01:56Z,"This is real! I just downloaded the sample, and the quality is great - I promise that this isn't any recode of the crappy workprint or the badly cropped and hissing-sounding TC. The sound is in 2 ch. ac3, and sounds great! No mono-shit here!

Also; The sample has to be real, cause the footage in it is not taken from any trailer or webstuff. You've got my word! And it might be that ""Dapoo"" is just a pseudonym, because the real group are afraid of George Lucas' lawyers. (But that I don't know..)

A big thanks to SuupaDuupa! :)"
,SuupaDuupa,2005-06-05T01:59Z,"thank you very much for your confirmation =)

very appreciated for everyone i believe =D"
,kozak71,2005-06-05T02:03Z,"i just download a sample and its sth wrong with it, I cant open it with my vplayer, allplayer,subeditplayer, only thing which opens it its vlcplayer, and it's often use with matroska files... "
,Daven,2005-06-05T02:07Z,"this is not real, its not dvdrip just modified tc rip ...better light (contrast). "
,kozak71,2005-06-05T02:09Z,"it's not important if it was a real dvd rip or not, important thing is a stunning quality, but like i said, sth is wrong with a sample..."
,Daven,2005-06-05T02:12Z,no sample works fine
,abilas,2005-06-05T02:12Z,"I agree with you Kozak, I only managed to play it on VLC... But my Xbox played it nicely. It might be encoded in the newest xvid-codec (check if you have it), or maybe the newest ac3-codec (ac3 filter...)."
,SuupaDuupa,2005-06-05T02:13Z,"It's encoded in QPEL because my standalone dvd player can't play QPEL,and that's how i found that out =)"
,kozak71,2005-06-05T02:18Z,where i can find this qpel shit ? i have ffdshow only... grr
,SuupaDuupa,2005-06-05T02:20Z,well..i play it witout any problems with VLC media player which you can get at  www.videolan.org
,kozak71,2005-06-05T02:21Z,"i know, i play it too, but i want to play it in normal player, because of subtitles, ya know, i'm from non english country ;) in vlc its allways problem with too fast subtitles..."
,SuupaDuupa,2005-06-05T02:22Z,"aha =)..okey..
well..i hope someone finds a way and will post it here =D"
,kozak71,2005-06-05T02:37Z,"ok, i have a question to everybody, except supad dupa :) how to open this file with normal movie playery (not vlc), what codecs should I have... ? I have only ffdshow and xvid and i cant open this file (sample) thx 4 quick reply"
,kozak71,2005-06-05T02:38Z,I should add that i have newest ffdshow and ac3 filter...

,mjamesskuba,2005-06-06T02:13Z,has the qpel situation on the dvp-642 been fixed or is there anyway around it? Is the only way around it to re-encode it? I really want this to work on my dvd player.
,SuupaDuupa,2005-06-06T02:36Z,there is a DVD-R out which is based on this release which means the same quality =)..but my upload isn't that good (only 1mbit) and I can't seed for that long =(
,mjamesskuba,2005-06-06T02:45Z,So Xvid pretty much wont work because of that Qpel thing huh? Theres got to be a way tp make it work!
,SuupaDuupa,2005-06-06T02:47Z,no it does work.. just download vlc media player from www.videolan.org ..thats it..
,mjamesskuba,2005-06-06T02:49Z,"It works on my computer already, but I want it to play on my DVP-642 dvd player. How can you make Qpel work on that thing?"
,SuupaDuupa,2005-06-06T02:58Z,aha..you could re-encode it or something..google it =)
