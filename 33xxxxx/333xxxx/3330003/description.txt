Release Notes:

The other release was nuked because it was a russian bootleg of
the webrip. Here's ours, enjoy.

-
Co produced by Gorillaz/Damon Albarn and Danger Mouse, "Demon
Days" was recorded at the band's own Kong Studios. The album is
a darker and more intense affair than 2001's "Gorillaz". The 
colours are rich, dark and heavy, while the rhythms are clean,
strategic and relentless.
