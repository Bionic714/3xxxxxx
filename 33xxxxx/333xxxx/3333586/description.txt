What is the World Grid? How can it be it mapped? What does it do? Why should we be interested about it? What does it have to with anti-gravity? Are megalithic sites laid out on a grid? What is a grid anyway? Is gravity a manifestation of energy from the Earth, connected with the Grid? If so, can we use certain points on the Grid to master gravity? Are UFOs defying the Earth's gravity field, using some sort of anti-gravity? Were the Incas, or perhaps an earlier culture aware of the world grid? Why is Avebury so important? Are significant places in history nodes of the grid system? Why should we be concerned, anyway?
