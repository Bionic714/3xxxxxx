,palsundt,2005-05-23T05:07Z,"is this supposed to be funny? ""documentary"". it doesn't have anything to do with critical approach, rather it confirms its own prejudice. a journalistic catastrophe. if you are interested in establishment criticism then check out www.chomskytorrents.org or simply do a search for real documentaries like ""the corporation"" or ""manufacturing consent"" alternatively check out Noam Chomsky's blog: http://blog.zmag.org/bloggers/?blogger=chomsky

If you are looking for a laugh, check out your local park. i think the circus season is coming up.
