,speakeasy,2005-06-25T21:33Z,Thanks tobio.  BTW I'm still only on episode 7 of your Dr Who posting :-)
,TL34EVER,2005-06-30T05:31Z,"Hey Tobio25 - Thanks man!  All of these episodes are awesome.  Your work is so appreciated.  Living in the states is cool for a lot of things but not for a Dr Who fan.  And I have been one for 24 years.  Anyway, Thanks Again - You Rock!"
,pwei1995,2005-07-10T06:40Z,"Thanks very much for all your work on the DVB releases - just thought you might want to know the BBC are repeating the entire series of Who and Confidential very soon.

I don't suppose you'd be able to capture the first ep of Confidential and post it to fully complete the collection? Many, many thanks in advance if you can!"
