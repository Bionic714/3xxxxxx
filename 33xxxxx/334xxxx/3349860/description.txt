              Despite becoming one of the rock's biggest concert
              attractions, Ted Nugent needed that one album and single
              that would break through in a big way, and the 1977 album
              and single of the same name, Cat Scratch Fever, did the
              trick. Cat Scratch Fever matched the focused ferocity of
              Nugent's excellent 1975 debut (due to singer Derek St.
              Holmes' re-entry into the band), featuring another
              first-rate set of brash hard rockers. While the title
              track is a certified classic anthem (the only solo-Nugent
              single to crack the Top 30), other tracks are just as
              delightful, such as the oh so subtle "Wang Dang Sweet
              Poontang." Further standouts include such underrated
              compositions as "Live It Up," "Workin' Hard, Playin'
              Hard," and "Out of Control," plus the exquisitely melodic
              instrumental "Home Bound," which the Beastie Boys would
              sample on their 1992 mega-hit album Check Your Head (the
              track "The Biz vs. the Nuge"). A Top 20 release, Cat
              Scratch Fever was the last Nugent release to feature his
              original solo band, (St. Holmes, along with bassist Rob
              Grange, left for good in 1978). And while he enjoyed
              further chart success with such titles as Weekend
              Warriors and Double Live Gonzo, many consider Cat Scratch
              Fever to be Ted Nugent's finest hour.
