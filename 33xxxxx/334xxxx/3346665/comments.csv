,gorgonvakt,2005-06-20T13:11Z,Thanks for this upload! Been waiting for a good quality version of 1x09. Will 1x10 and 1x11 follow ?
,gorgonvakt,2005-06-20T13:12Z,Sorry for the multiple comment. I hit the refresh button and they just showed up..:-(
,KrAcK,2005-06-20T19:04Z,Is this a reencode of the mpeg2 480x480 file that was on demonoid?
,yabosid,2005-06-20T19:41Z,"@Krack
I'm not sure which one they post on demonoid, but I think they post the same that is posted on usenet there.

If so, .. this is a re-encode of THAT, yes =)

@gorgonvakt
Yes, .. 10 and 11 will be posted after this =)"
,KrAcK,2005-06-20T19:58Z,"thanks for the quick answer, that's because I already made a xvid version out of this mpeg2 file. I was hoping to find a better version (higher than 480x480) but as you're using the same file as mine I won't have to download the episode again... :)

Thanks anyway for the share."
