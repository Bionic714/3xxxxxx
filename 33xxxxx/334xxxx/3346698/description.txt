Cedega 4.3.2

It can be used for all kind of linux even gentoo [can be inserted in portage tree]. Here's a howto for 4.3.1 [sry, I haven't fount newer]:


                 TransGaming Cedega HOWTO Guide 4.3-1.1.1.1.en
                 ===============================================

This guide provides an overview of how to use TransGaming's Cedega to run your 
favorite games on Linux.  If you have any questions about how to use Cedega, or 
if you have other support issues, please use TransGaming's web-based support 
system at http://www.transgaming.org/forum/

===================
System Requirements
===================

The following are the minimum requirements for Cedega 4.3:

Operating System
----------------
Core requirements are: 
- Linux Kernel 2.2 or higher. Stock Kernels recommended over RedHat 
  7.x/8.x/9.x kernels. 2.6 kernels are not recommended due to stability
  issues.
- XFree86 4.0 or higher (4.2 and above recommended) 
- glibc 2.2 or higher 
- working hardware accelerated OpenGL video card

CPU Type and Speed
------------------
Recommended minimum hardware is 
- 500 MHz or faster Pentium or Athlon CPU 
- 64MB of memory; 128 MB or higher recommended
- 1-2 GB free hard disk space for games 
- Linux Supported 3D graphics card with 16MB of video RAM is required.  
  Nvidia GeForce-class GPU recommended. ATI Radeon 8500 or higher with
  working ATI FireGL drivers should work for many (though not all) games, 
  but will not perform as well for the moment.

Please note: individual requirements may be higher for certain games.

====================================
Configuring Your Computer for Cedega
====================================

Make sure that your video card has working 3D acceleration 
----------------------------------------------------------
Make sure that the latest drivers for your video card have been installed on 
your system, and that OpenGL is working properly.  (NVidia card owners, please 
visit http://www.nvidia.com.  ATI card owners, please visit http://www.ati.com)

To test your graphics card for OpenGL support execute the following command:

  $ glxinfo | grep #direct rendering#

output will return "direct rendering:"

If this is 'Yes' or 'Enabled' then OpenGL is likely set up correctly.  If it is 
listed as 'no' or 'disabled' then double-check your 3D setup.

You may also want to try a performance test.  Execute the following to run a 
simple benchmark included on most popular Linux distributions:

 $ glxgears

The glxgears program will output an FPS (Frames Per Second) rating to the 
command line.  If 3D acceleration is correctly enabled for your video card,
then the reported FPS should be well over 500 FPS at the default window size.
If the output shows less than 500 FPS then you should double check your 3D 
setup.

In some cases it is possible to have multiple OpenGL libraries
installed on your system.  If you are having problems with Cedega, you may 
wish to check whether this is the case for your system.  You can easily 
do so by executing:

 $ locate libGL

This will display any OpenGL libraries you have on your system.  In 
particular, you should be cautious of having libGL in both /usr/lib 
as well as in /usr/X11R6/lib.  Sometimes, the software-only Mesa OpenGL 
libraries are installed in /usr/X11R6/lib and hardware accelerated drivers 
are installed elsewhere.  We do not recommend removing the Mesa libraries 
from /usr/X11R6/lib unless you are seeing slow rendering in games running 
under Cedega.

Check your cd devices and mount points for permissions
------------------------------------------------------
Many Windows games use copy protection systems that requires Cedega to have 
'read' access to your CD-ROM device, as well as 'read' and 'execute' access 
to your CD-ROM mount point.  Check your CD-ROM devices and mount points to 
ensure that Cedega has appropriate permissions. 

If you do not know what devices and mount points are being used by your 
system, you can read the /etc/fstab file for more information using the 
following command:

 $ less /etc/fstab

To change the permissions on your CD-ROM device and mount points, execute the 
following commands as 'root':

 # chmod a+r [CD-ROM Device]
 # chmod a+rx [CD-ROM mount point]

Many distributions of Linux use symbolically linked devices.  You will also
need to change permissions on the linked devices as well.  To see if a device
is linked, run the following command:

 $ ls -la [CD-ROM Device]

This command will return information that may resemble the following:

lr-xr-xr-x    1 root     root           13 Aug 21 14:45 /dev/cdrom -> cdroms/cdrom0

If the output displays a -> then this device is linked.  In the above output the
device /dev/cdrom is symbolically linked to the device /dev/cdrom/cdroms/cdrom0.
Be sure to change the permissions on all linked devices.

Under some circumstances, you may need to edit your /etc/fstab file to ensure
that all users have access to the CD-ROM mount point.  


Check your X configuration file
-------------------------------
Depending on your distro this may be called either XF86Config, XF86Config-4 
or xorg.conf. 

Games often attempt to change your screen resolution to fit their needs.
Make sure that the 'Screen' section of your X config file has a number 
of resolutions.  The most common resolutions are: 1600X1200,  1280X1024,
1024X768, 800X600, 640X480. If the game is not running at fullscreen properly,
check the game settings to see what resolution it is attempting to use and 
make sure that resolution is listed in your X config file.  	

Note:  You may experience improved performance with some games when running 
the X server at 16 bit color depth.

Disable Sound Servers
---------------------
Many Linux desktop systems such as KDE and Gnome run sound servers such as 
'ARTS' or 'esd'.  These sound servers can cause sound problems within Cedega 
by reserving exclusive access to the sound device.  If you are having sound 
problems make sure to disable any sound servers or other applications that 
may be using sound, such as 'xmms'.

Check free space limitations
----------------------------
Some systems may be set up with restrictive space quotas on the /home 
directory.  These limitations can cause Cedega to incorrectly report available 
free space.  You may experience problems installing games if the 
available space is reported incorrectly, or if there is not enough space
available on your system.  If you experience any error messages reporting
that there is not enough hard drive space to install a game, disable quotas, 
or symbolically link to a device with more free space available.

Prelink, Exec-Shield and VA Layout
----------------------------------
As of Cedega 4.3, there are no longer any compatability issues between prelink, 
exec-shield, the new VA layout and Cedega.  These features can be left enabled 
and will work seamlessly with Cedega.

For versions of Cedega older than 4.3 please refer to the Prelink, Exec-Shield, 
and VA Layout section in the 4.2.1 Release Notes or HOWTO Guide.

Exec (error = 21)
-----------------
Some distributions' versions of mount now run with the noexec option unless 
otherwise specified.  Running games from a partition mounted with noexec can 
cause an error = 21 message.

To fix this issue, edit /etc/fstab and modify the partition line by 
changing 'noexec' to 'exec' in the mount options.  

For example, change:
 /dev/hda1 / ext3 errors=remount-ro,no-exec,defaults 0 1
to:
 /dev/hda1 / ext3 errors=remount-ro,exec,defaults 0 1

If neither "exec" nor "no-exec" appears in the line it is recommended that you
add "exec" to ensure that the partition can be used by Cedega.

To remount the partition run:
 $ mount -o remount /


======================
How To Install Cedega:
======================

Cedega is available in a variety of pre-built binary packages designed to 
suit your Linux distribution.  Please note that TransGaming does not provide 
official support for packages built from source. 

First select the package that is right for you:

rpm - RedHat Package Management (RedHat Linux, Mandrake Linux, etc)

 To install the Cedega rpm package open a console/terminal window and execute 
 the following command as 'root':

   # rpm  -ivh  cedega-[version].rpm

deb - Debian Package (Debian GNU/Linux, Corel/Xandros Linux, Lindows, etc)

 To install the Cedega deb package open a console/terminal window and execute 
 the following command as 'root':

   # dpkg  -i  cedega_[version].deb

tgz - Tar GZipped Package (Slackware Linux, etc)

 To install the Cedega tgz package open a console/terminal window and 
 execute the following commands as 'root':

   # cd /
   # tar -xvzf  cedega-[version].tgz 

Some distributions use their own package management tools, such as Gentoo and 
Slackware.  If this is so the tgz package of Cedega can be used with most of 
these tools.


Installing the Font Installer Package:
--------------------------------------
The font installer package is a convenience script provided by TransGaming 
for the purposes of downloading and installing the Microsoft Core Fonts.  Please 
note that you must accept a licencing agreement with Microsoft as part of 
the process in installing this package.

If you've already installed Cedega using the steps in the previous section, 
then this part should be familiar.  Otherwise, please review the steps above. 
Select the proper package for your distribution, and install it.

After the package is installed, each user who wishes to use the fonts will need 
to run the installer script.  At the command line, type:

  $ tg-font-install

From there, follow the on-screen instructions to complete the install.  This 
will install the fonts in that user's ~/.transgaming_global/Fonts/ directory.


Installing the Mozilla ActiveX Control Installer Package:
---------------------------------------------------------
The Mozilla ActiveX Control installer package is a custom win32 mozilla package 
provided by TransGaming for the purposes of providing support for HTML content 
to games inside of Cedega.  Please note that you must accept a licencing 
agreement with Mozilla and its developers in order to download and use this 
product.

If you've already installed Cedega using the steps listed above, then this part 
should be familiar.  Otherwise, please review the steps above.  Select the 
appropriate package for your distribution, and install it.

After the package is installed, each Linux user who wishes to use the Mozilla 
ActiveX Control will need to run the installer script.  At the command line, 
type:

  $ tg-mozctl-install

From there, follow the on-screen instructions to complete the install.  This 
will install the Mozilla ActiveX Control in that user's 
~/.transgaming_global/mozcontrol directory.

Once installed as directed above, Cedega will by default use the Mozilla 
ActiveX control to render HTML content, as appropriate.  If desired, it can
be disabled in the [wine] section of the config file by setting:
"MozillaControl" = "N"

==============================
Installing a Game Using Cedega
==============================

To install a game using Cedega open a console/terminal window, and follow 
the following procedure:

1) Insert and mount your cdrom drive.

    For the following examples we will be assuming a CD-ROM mount point 
    of /mnt/cdrom; your setup may be different, depending on your Linux 
    distribution.  The mount point for your cdrom can be found in 
    the /etc/fstab file.

2) Once the cd has been mounted check the contents of the disc.

   $ ls /mnt/cdrom

   Most installers will be named 'setup.exe' or 'install.exe'.  If this is 
   not the case, you may need to locate the install executable; it is often 
   listed in the documentation for the game, or you may need to check the 
   game information page on the TransGaming website. 

3) When you have located the correct installer executable, install the 
   game using:

   $ cedega  /mnt/cdrom/setup.exe  

   Then, follow the install instructions for the game you are installing.  
   You may experience some graphical errors during the copying 
   process.  These are generally not harmful.  

Some games require special install instructions or methods.  If you are having
problems installing a game please check the games database and forums found on 
the TransGaming Website.

Multi-Disc Installers:
----------------------
Some games that have multiple discs to install may not allow for unmounting
a CD-ROM as it may register as busy.  If this is the case, you should run the
installer with the -monitor-cdrom-eject option, and then you may press the eject
button on CD-RW or DVD drives and the disc will unmount and eject automatically.
For non RW/DVD cdrom drives you will need to run: killall -USR2 wineserver
This command will unmount and eject all CD-ROMs. Please note this command could 
also cause problems if there are multiple copies of the wineserver running.

This useful functionality is off by default due to the fact that the drivers for 
some hardware could cause problems with flash cards or degrade performance.

For more information, please see the "CD/DVD Ejection System" section below.

===========================
Playing a Game Using Cedega
===========================

There are three methods for starting a game once it has been installed.

Using the Desktop Icon:
-----------------------
 Some (but not all) games will create a desktop icon during the installation 
 process.  To start the game, simply open this icon using a click or 
 double-click, depending on your window manager settings.

 If you wish to pass special options to Cedega or the game edit the desktop 
 shortcut and add in the appropriate options.

Using the Start Menu:
---------------------
 Some games, on some Linux distributions will add a link to the start 
 menu on your desktop.  Simply click the start menu, go to TransGaming -> Programs
 and then the game name/vendor and select the game icon.  

 Again, if you wish to pass special options to Cedega or the game edit the menu 
 item shortcut.

Using the Command Line:
=======================

 Open a console/terminal window and change into the game directory using the
 following commands:

 $ cd ~/TransGaming_Drive/Program Files/[Game Directory]
 $ cedega [wine options] game.exe [game options]

Options can be passed both to Cedega and the game using the command line.

The options for Cedega are:

 -bigexe  
	As of Cedega 4.3 this option is now the default behaviour, and is only 
	accepted for backwards compatibility.

 -use-pthreads
        A way to override the use of pthreads. This option should be
        automatically set by Cedega, however, if problems exist it may be useful 
        to change the pthreads option.  Acceptable values are yes or no.

 -winver
        Specify the version of Windows Cedega will report: win95, win98, winme, 
        nt351, nt40, win2k, winxp, win20, win30, win31
        The default setting is win98.

 -debugmsg
        Display error information/output:
        +all, -all, +relay, +dsound, +err are the most common options
        -all is the default option, and will suppress any errors

 -use-dos-cwd
        Specifies the Cedega working directory.  The default is the current 
        directory.   Directories may be specified using either DOS or Linux 
        filenames.

 -monitor-cdrom-eject
        Enables the CD eject polling functionality.  This option is off by 
        default and typically only needs to be enabled for some multidisk 
        installers.  When enabled, the CD-ROM drives are periodically checked to 
        see if the CD-ROM's eject button has been pressed.  Even when disabled, 
        the eject can be forced by sending the USR2 signal to the wineserver 
        process.  Care should be taken when enabling this option on systems 
        which have compact flash drives.

 -version
        Report the version of Cedega that you are using

Options for individual games can usually be found in the game's 'README' file.


==================
Configuring Cedega
==================

Cedega configuration options are located in the '.transgaming' directory found 
in your home directory. The main configuration file is '.transgaming/config'.  
This is an ASCII text file. The first time you run Cedega, the '.transgaming' 
directory will be automatically created for you, in a default preconfigured 
state.  The default preconfigured state is copied from the 
/usr/lib/transgaming_cedega/.transgaming directory. 

To edit the Cedega configuration settings open '~/.transgaming/config' in your 
favorite text editor.

Drives Section
--------------
This section defines the drives that Cedega will use. New drives can be 
specified here if necessary. Any CD-ROM or DVD drives connected to your system 
will be automatically detected by Cedega at runtime, and new drive letters will 
be dynamically assigned to them. You should not need to add CD-ROM or DVD drives 
manually unless you are having configuration problems.

The format for this section is as follows:
[Drive LETTER]     - The drive name, where LETTER is the DOS/Windows drive letter 
                     i.e. c, d, e, z
Path = LOCATION    - The location for the drive root.
Type = TYPE        - Specifies drive type; supported types are: floppy, hd, cdrom 
                     and network
Label = XXXX       - Drive label, max 11 characters
Serial = XXXX      - Drive serial number, max 8 characters hexadecimal
Filesystem=TYPE    - Filesystem type supported file systems are: dos, fat, win95, 
                     vfat, and unix
Device=/dev/DEVICE - Allows you to specify a specific device if raw access is
                     required.  It is recommend that if the device is symbolically
                     linked than you should use the device that is not a link (the
                     originator).

wine Section
------------
This section is for general options.

"MozillaControl" = "Y"
This option defines whether or not Cedega will use the Mozilla ActiveX control 
if it is available.  The default is on.

DLL Section
-----------
This section defines which DLLs are used by Cedega.  The syntax is as follows:
"dllname"       = "builtin, native"    or
"dllname"       = "native, builtin"

The order defines which is used first. If builtin is listed first it will use 
the Cedega builtin dll, if native is listed first Cedega will use a native 
Windows dll if it is present in the configured system directory. Occasionally,
using a native Windows may improve compatibility with some programs.

x11drv Section
--------------
This section contains the settings for interaction between Cedega and the X 
server.  Some of the most commonly used options are: 

"Managed" = "Y"
This option changes whether the Cedega window is a managed window.  The 
default is yes.  Managed windows are managed by the Window Manager rather 
than Cedega.

"Desktop" = "800X600"
This option allows you to run Cedega within a window of the specified size.  
This line is commented out by default, thus allowing games to create a 
top-level X Window for each window that is opened.  

"DXGrab" = "Y"
This option turns mouse grab on/off.  The default is on.  When mouse grab 
is on, the application may lock the mouse cursor within a window, typically
when the application wants to take over the full screen of your system.

"XVidMode" = "Y"
This option allows applications to resize the resolution of your display.  
By default, this option is on, allowing applications to switch between 
resolutions listed in the XF86Config file.

"UseXRandR" = "N"
Use XRandR extension, if present, to resize the resolution of your display.
This option is similar to XVidMode but may provide additional functionality 
in some cases.

"ShowFPS" = "N"
This option turns the TransGaming HUD that displays the in game FPS on/off.
Default is off.

"ShowMEM" = "N"
This option toggles to display of memory statics on the TransGaming HUD.  
You must have ShowFPS activated for this to take effect.  Default is off.

"VideoRam" = "32"
This is the amount of video RAM your video card has (in megabytes).

"AGPVertexRam" = "32"
This is the amount of memory (in megabytes) that can be allocated for use 
with accelerated vertex buffers when using NV_VAR.  A good value for this 
typically half of your AGP aperture size. For best results using Cedega you 
should set your AGP aperture to at least 128MB (this can be done in your 
bios) and set AGPVertexRam to 64.

"NV_VAR" = "Y"
Enable usage of the NVidia Vertex Array Range extension for Accelerated Vertex 
Buffers.  This extension is only available on NVidia cards.  The default is on.  
This option has precedence over the ARB_VBO option, if both are available and 
enabled. 

"ARB_VBO" = "Y"
Enable the usage of the OpenGL ARB Vertex Buffer Object extension for 
Accelerated Vertex Buffers.  This extension is available on both NVidia and ATI 
cards, although support for it is still experimental at this stage and is not 
as mature or fully featured as NV_VAR.  The use of NV_VAR is recommended if 
available, and has precedence if both are enabled.  The default is on.


d3dgl Section 
-------------
This section contains the settings for advanced graphical functionality.

"AnisotropicTextureFiltering" = "N"
Enable anisotropic texture filtering, which is a method of improving the look 
of textures when viewed from an angle.  This may result in visual improvements 
in some cases, but may cause a considerable drop in FPS (up to 50%).  The 
default is off.

"VertexShaders" = "Y"
Vertex shaders are used to add complex-to-compute graphical routines that are 
often optional. While the Cedega implementation of vertex shaders is hardware 
accelerated when the underlying OpenGL driver supports it, it may be implemented 
in software emulation on some cards.  It is impossible for Cedega to determine 
if software or hardware vertex shaders are available. When enabled, Cedega 
reports hardware vertex shaders support to applications, if the 
ARB_vertex_program extension is available.  When disabled, some applications may 
rely on their own optimized software fallbacks.  Default is on.

"PixelShaders" = "Y"
Pixel shaders are used to compute complex per-pixel lighting and coloring.  In 
some games the use of pixel shaders is optional, and disabling it can result in 
faster gameplay, although at the expense of lower quality graphics.  When 
enabled Cedega reports pixel shaders support to applications, if the 
ARB_fragment_program extension is available.  When disabled, some applications 
may rely on their own fallbacks.  Default is on.
For more information on this option, please see later in this document.

"PixelShadersLevel" = "1.3"
Which version of pixel shader support to report to applications.  Valid options 
are "1.0", "1.1", "1.2", and "1.3".  The default is "1.3".  Note that this has 
no effect if pixel shaders are disabled, or not supported by hardware.

"ClipSpaceFix" = "Y"
This option allows Cedega to better emulate the differences in the graphical 
depth component (z) between D3D and OpenGL.  As of version 4.0, this option can 
safely be enabled at all times.  However in previous versions, it should be 
disabled when applications make use of vertex shaders as this can result in 
incorrect graphics.  The default is on.

"FixedProgram" = "Auto"
This option contols whether the fixed function over vertex shaders path is 
enabled or if the legacy fixed function path is used.  The use of Fixed 
Programs requires the OpenGL ARB_vertex_program extension to be present,and
for optimal performance, must be implemented in hardware. Valid options are 
Yes/No/Auto. The default value is Auto, which auto-detects the type of 
graphics card used, and enables fixed programs if appropriate.  Set this 
option to "No" to use the legacy fixed function path.  Set this option to 
"Yes" to use the fixed function over vertex shader technology.
For more information on this option, please see later in this document.

"RectangleTextures" = "Auto"
Most recent hardware has support for non-power of two (NPOT) textures, and 
this is exposed under OpenGL using either the XXX_rectangle_texture or 
ARB_texture_non_power_of_two extensions.  This option deals with the former, 
and is used to enable/disable support under Direct3D.  Older cards are not 
capable of handling these textures and vertex shaders at the same time, due 
to limitations of the vertex shader hardware, so if you wish to use npot 
textures here, you may need to disable VertexShaders.  Set this option 
to "Yes" to use npot textures.  Set this to "No" to disable them.  The 
default is "Auto", which auto-detects whether your system has sufficient 
capabilities in the VertexShaders, and if not, disables it.

"FragmentOffset" = "Auto"
The semantics of the the FragmentOffset option have changed in Cedega 4.3, 
with the addition of a new type of offset.  Possible values are "No", "Tex", 
"Auto", and "Pos".  The default is "Auto" which automatically selects the 
correct type of offset depending on the game and your video card. "Tex" 
applies the fragment offset to the texture coordinates (this was the default 
in previous versions). "Pos" applies the fragment offset to the vertex 
position (this is currently the default for most games).  "No" disables 
the fragment offset for all games.


dinput Section
--------------
This section contains options that control how dinput behaves.

"DefaultDeadZone" = "1000"
This option allows you to define the default dead zone for your joystick 
expressed as a number between 0 and 10000. The default is 1000 which is 
10% of the range of your joystick.


joystick Section
----------------
This section contains the configuration for how joysticks should be treated 
under Cedega.

"Logitech Inc. WingMan RumblePad" = "X,Y,slider,Z,RZ,hat,none"
Controls the configuration of the function of joystick axes.  The joystick name 
and axis functions can be determined with the program 'jstest'.  The available 
axis types are:
"none", "X", "Y", "Z", "RX", "RY", "RZ", "slider", "hat", "POV", and "ball"
"hat" and "POV" are synonymous. Hats use two axes.
The name on the left should correspond to that reported by the actual joystick 
installed.

opengl Section
--------------
This section contains options that control how Windows OpenGL (WGL) behaves.

"FixedGLExtensionBuffer" = "N"
This option present a truncated list of OpenGL extensions to the application 
rather than the full list of extensions supported by the drivers. This is useful 
in cases where the application cannot handle extremely long options. If you need 
to be able to offer specific options, rather than the fixed list that this 
offers, then you want to also the GLExtensionBuffer option. This option will 
probably only need to be used for Medal of Honor.

"GLExtensionBuffer" = ""
This option is a comma-separate list of extensions prefixed with + or - that 
turns on or off the reporting of individual extension to the application. This 
gives the user complete control over what extensions are enabled/disabled so 
they can tweak/tune as necessary. Turning an option on here does not magically 
give the card the capability to do it. The options for the list follow the 
standard OpenGL naming convention (ie "+GL_ARB_imaging,-GL_ARB_depth_texture"). 
You should only need to use this option in very extreme cases. 
If "FixedGLExtensionBuffer" = "N" then this option will be ignored.

Wineserver Section
------------------
This section contains options that controls how the WineServer process is run.

"SHMWineserver" = "Y"
This option indicates if Cedega should accelerate interprocess communication (AIC) 
between the client and server. This value can be either "Y" or "N" and defaults 
to "Y". It is suggested that you set it to "Y" as for some titles it can have a 
very positive impact on performance.

WinMM Section
-------------
This section controls the systems that are used for sound play back.

"Drivers" = "wineoss.drv"
Controls whether the Open Sound System (OSS) or Advanced Linux Sound Architecture 
(ALSA) sound system is used.  Specify "wineoss.drv" to use the OSS sound system 
and "winealsa.drv" to use the ALSA sound system.  The default is "wineoss.drv".  
Note that if neither is specified, Cedega will produce no sound.

"WaveMapper" = "msacm.drv"
"MidiMapper" = "midimap.drv"

wineoss Section
---------------
This section controls how the Open Sound System (OSS) system is used for sound 
playback, if enabled appropriately in the WinMM section.

"UseMMap" = "N"
This option allows you to configure Cedega to write directly to memory on the 
sound card rather than having to use the slower route through the kernel. This 
can be set to either "Y" or "N"; the default is "N".  Can improve performance, 
but is not available with all sound cards.

"FullDuplex" = "N"
Allows sound to be recorded and played back at the same time. Not available on 
all sound cards.  The default is off.

"dsp0" = "/dev/dsp0"
"mixer0" = "/dev/mixer0"
Specify a mapping for which digital audio device to use for OSS sound playback.  
The default for "dps0" is "/dev/dsp0" and for "mixer0" is "/dev/mixer0"

winealsa Section 
----------------
This section controls how the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) system is 
used for sound play back, if enabled appropriately in the WinMM section.

"UseMMap" = "Y"
This option allows you to configure Cedega to write directly to memory on the 
sound card rather than having to use the slower route through the kernel. This 
can be set to either "Y" or "N"; the default is "Y".  Cann improve performance, 
but is not available with all sound cards.

"pcm0" = "hw"
"ctl0" = "hw"
These options allow you to specify what ALSA sound devices Cedega should use. 
The default values are "hw" for pcm0 and "hw" for ctl0. Appropriate selection of 
these options can allow you to select a secondary sound card or a plugin. It 
should be noted that most ALSA plugins seem to be quite buggy and will not work 
with "UseMMap" = "Y".


==============================================
Sharing a .transgaming Directory Between Users
==============================================

To make your .transgaming directory available to all users on your computer, 
you will need to create a 'transgaming' group and assign all users who will 
be using the shared directory to this group.

As root, execute the commands described below:

Copy a clean .transgaming directory to the share location.

 # cp  -R  /usr/lib/transgaming_cedega/.transgaming  /SHARE_LOCATION

Change the ownership of this folder to the group transgaming.

 # chgrp  -R transgaming  .transgaming 
 # chown  -R g+srwx  .transgaming

Make a backup of the original .transgaming directory 

 # mv  -R  /usr/lib/transgaming_cedega/.transgaming  /usr/lib/transgaming_cedega/.transgaming.backup

Create a logical link to the new .transgaming directory.

 # ln  -s  /SHARE_LOCATION/.transgaming  /usr/lib/transgaming_cedega/.transgaming

Edit the /usr/bin/cedega script to take into account the new link.
Open /usr/bin/cedega with your favorite text editor and find the line:

 export WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.transgaming"

and change it to

 export WINEPREFIX="/SHARE_LOCATION"

If a user on your computer has already run Cedega and has a .transgaming 
directory in their home directory it will need to be moved or deleted before 
they may use the shared directory.

Please note if your shared .transgaming becomes corrupted and needs to 
be deleted you can delete it (this will cause all installed games to be lost) 
and then copy the backup .transgaming to the share as follows:

 # cp  -R  /usr/lib/transgaming_cedega/.transgaming.backup  /SHARE_LOCATION/.transgaming



=======================================
Configuring Cedega differently per Game
=======================================

You may wish to have different Cedega settings for each game that you have 
installed.  This can be easily done by editing your Cedega config file, 
~/.transgaming/config

To add per game settings open this file in your favorite text editor and 
move to the end of the file.  At the end of the file add a line:

[AppDefaults\EXECUTABLE.EXE\SECTION]
  AppDefaults     Sets the following as default for the application
  Executable.exe  The game executable that is run to start the application
  SECTION         The section you wish to modify the settings for.
                  IE: x11drv, fonts, Drive name/locations.

For Example, Max Payne has a game executable called 'Max Payne.exe'
If you wish to have custom settings for Max Payne you would require 
an entry as follows:

[AppDefaults\Max Payne.exe\x11drv]
"Desktop" = "1024X768"
"DXGrab" =  "N"

This would force Max Payne to run in a 1024X768 Desktop window with the 
Mouse Grab feature disabled.

Understanding Cedega Features
=============================

Fixed Function over Vertex Shaders
----------------------------------
Fixed Function over Vertex Shaders (also called Fixed Programs) is an
implementation of the Direct3D fixed function vertex processing pipeline
using programmable vertex shaders.  There are two main benefits of this 
technique.  First, we can utilize the vertex data in the format as provided 
by Direct3D without the need to convert it into a format that is suitable for 
the OpenGL fixed function pipeline.  This allows us to eliminate the copy 
and conversion overhead and store the vertex data directly in accelerated
(AGP or video) memory.  Second, this approach allows us the flexibility of
implementing Direct3D functionality that is not available in, or has different 
semantics from, the OpenGL fixed function APIs.  

Fixed Programs are currently auto-detected based upon the type of video card
that your system is running.  It is possible to override the auto-detection
process with the use of the "FixedProgram" option in the [d3dgl] section of 
the config file (this option is unavailable in Point2Play at this time).  
Advanced users may wish to experiment with this option to determine the optimal 
setting for their system and games. In order to use Fixed Programs your graphics 
drivers must support the OpenGL ARB_vertex_program extension. 

To enable Fixed Programs, place the line:
"FixedProgram" = "Yes" 
in the [d3dgl] section of your config file.

To disable Fixed Programs, place the line:
"FixedProgram" = "No" 
in the [d3dgl] section of your config file.

To have Fixed Programs auto-detected based on your graphics card, place the line:
"FixedProgram" = "Auto" 
in the [d3dgl] section of your config file (this is the default setting).

Currently Fixed Programs are enabled by default on NVIDIA GeForce FX and 
later graphics cards, and disabled for earlier cards.  Fixed Programs do not 
currently work on ATI cards due to driver issues. See below 
for the recommended settings for specific graphics cards.

GeForce, GeForce2, GeForce4 MX, and GeForce4 Go series cards:
While the drivers for these cards do support the ARB_vertex_program extension,
these cards do not have hardware support for vertex programs and as such they 
are emulated in software by the driver, resulting in very poor performance.  
It is STRONGLY recommended that Fixed Programs be disabled for these cards.

GeForce3 and GeForce4 series cards:
These cards do support hardware vertex programs, but high resource requirements
for some games may prevent Fixed Programs from working correctly. However many
games are fully functional and gain a significant performance boost by using 
Fixed Programs.  It is recommended that you enable Fixed Programs on a game-
by-game basis. If you experience missing or corrupt geometry in a specific title, 
you should disable Fixed Programs for that game.

GeForce FX and later cards:
Fixed Programs can safely be enabled on these cards.


Pixel Shaders
-------------
Pixel Shaders are a DirectX 8 and higher feature that are used by many 
games for graphical effects. Cedega's Pixel Shaders are built on top of 
the OpenGL ARB_fragment_program extension. ARB_fragment_program is
more powerful than Pixel Shaders versions 1.0-1.3, but is only
supported on a higher class of graphics card. Thus, while Pixel Shaders 
are available on Windows systems starting with GeForce 3 or Radeon 8500, 
ARB_fragment_program is only available starting with GeForce FX and 
Radeon 9500 cards.

What this means is that a game which may have a minimum requirement
of a GeForce 3 may actually be making the assumption that Pixel Shaders
are available. In these situations the game may not function correctly
without them.  For example, Battlefield Vietnam requires Pixel Shaders
to play at higher detail levels. While a GeForce 3 is capable of 
playing the game on a Windows system, a GeForce FX is required to play
the game under Linux, as only the FX series supports ARB_fragment_program
on Linux.


CD/DVD Ejection System
----------------------
In the past, games that came on multiple CD-ROMs posed a problem for
Cedega users, since the Linux OS would 'lock' the CD-ROM tray in some
cases, preventing users from ejecting a disk and inserting the
next disk.

Cedega 4.0 included a new feature that eliminated this problem in
many cases. Simply by pressing the eject button on one's CD-ROM drive 
and waiting a few seconds (ejecting may take as long as 10 seconds), 
the disk would automatically be unmounted and ejected.  Then one could 
insert a new disk, perform whatever mounting step was required by the 
Linux distribution, and seamlessly continue with an install.

Beginning with Cedega 4.0.1, automatic monitoring of CD-ROM drive eject 
buttons is off by default due to reported problems with some hardware
such as compact flash readers and certain CD-ROM drive brands.  It can 
be manually enabled by passing --monitor-cdrom-eject on the command line.  
When using Point2Play, the eject monitoring feature is by default enabled
while running installers, and disabled at other times to prevent in-game 
performance problems.  It may be forced on or off in Point2Play by going 
into Configure -> CDROM Eject Monitoring and setting Always ON or 
Always OFF

When the monitoring option is active, it should work on most recent
model CD-RW and DVD drives.  With older drives, or with the monitoring
option disabled you can still force the ejection of an otherwise in-use
disc by using the Point2Play 'Unmount' button, or by manually sending a 
SIGUSR2 signal to the wineserver process using a command such as:

 $ killall -USR2 wineserver

Of special note, please be warned that while Point2Play will unmount and 
eject only the drive in question, using the command line above will unmount 
and eject all of the drives in your system.  If you have other Wine based 
software running, such as CodeWeavers CrossOver Office product, you may wish 
to avoid the use of the unmount button or the killall command mentioned 
above, as they will cause any non Cedega 4.0 based Wine process to halt.
In all other respects, using the Point2Play unmount feature should act the 
same as hitting the drive's eject button.

Some installers may require you to re-insert the first CD-ROM to complete 
your install.  Depending on the title, this may not yet work successfully.

Please contact TransGaming support if you have any issues relating to CD-ROM 
eject support, so that we can continue to improve this feature.
