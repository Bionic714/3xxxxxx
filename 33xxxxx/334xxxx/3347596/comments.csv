,papa47,2005-07-02T21:59Z,"Over a thousand downloads and no appreciation shown, what a shame."
,mdpopescu,2005-07-05T18:32Z,"Papa47, you shouldn't be upset about this... since this isn't a closed site (you don't have to register to download anything), most people very likely don't bother. In fact, the ONLY reason I registered was to be able to leave this comment... (of course, now that I registered I'll hopefully comment some more)."
,plickplick,2005-07-08T02:31Z,"I usually never comments. But this one is a beuty and just surprised or fishing for creds you deserv it!
THANKS!! :) "
,misstanyassbbbw,2005-07-10T03:43Z,"it's all well and good to expect gratitude (in an inappropriate venue), but since it's taking 18 hours to get "
,papa47,2005-07-10T23:49Z,"You're seriously complaining?  You're getting something for nothing and not happy with how quickly you can get it?  Sheesh. My share ratio is over 20, not good enough?  Gimme a break.  And BTW, what other venue is there than right here?"
,cnotation,2005-07-20T19:02Z,OMG these are all  of Dean Koontz books! Right one man... I'm going to throw these on my PSP and have months of good reading.. Thanks Papa47

,Tall-Farang,2008-03-05T17:47Z,"Thank You for putting so many books onto pirate bay.  I normally just download books without acknowledging (?) the person who puts them on the net.  These books mean a great deal to me.  I am retired and living in Thailand.  There are not a lot of English books available.  So Thanks, Thanks,..."

,CaptainBeefheart314,2011-05-19T20:21Z,"Sadly LIT doesn't play on my reader (and most conversion programs produce what I'd like to call an abysmal result), coz this is an amazing collection.
And hey, papa47, did you notice? Somebody gave you TANKS! LOL, just don't invade Poland or anything, allright? :-D"
,chromepony,2011-08-08T18:25Z,"If you just want WEB Griffin, I just uploaded 35 of his books.  Search his name or click on Chromepony."
