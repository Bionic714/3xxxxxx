,crackmonkey,2005-06-14T00:02Z,"hey thanks for the shadow, i don't think he did bombay the hardway, thats kalyanji & anandji i think album name guns cars and sitars!! i'm just saying you fucked up , not that i'm not grateful for the music. "
,d-pad,2005-06-17T13:24Z,"shadow did beats/production on 1 or 2 tracks on bombay the hard way... did NOTHING on bombay 2.
""do androids dream..."" is post-shadow UNKLE dj set, so apart from the couple of shadow tracks in the mix he had nothing to do with it."
,teel,2005-06-30T23:58Z,"Actually ""do androids dream of electronic beats"" isn't DJ Shadow's. It consists of three mixes by Unklesounds, which is somekind of dj project by UNKLE's James Lavelle."
,teel,2005-06-30T23:59Z,oh that was said already. sorry about that :)
,hanne_boel,2005-07-02T22:05Z,nice torrent

,chainsawvigilante,2006-11-03T09:39Z,"bombay was taken from soundtracks to bollywood movies and then automator and shadow added beats over/under them.  and yeah he did do only a few tracks, but those two Indian composers were long dead before that shit came out.  don't you motherfuckers read liner notes?"

,Litsman3d,2009-02-07T11:40Z,Thx! Ivebeen lookin for these....
,d_u_t_t,2009-02-26T09:37Z,"this is worth the dl if you're a shadow fan, even if some of it isn't right...PLUS it has the remixed version of Radiohead's ""Gloaming"" which has made news recently just because hearing Bush stutter through ""terrer, nucleer, weepons"" is just hilarious... i was looking online for it forever till i realized it was on here, thanks spiritmongo! "
,Waldoh,2009-04-16T01:42Z,D u T T where is that Gloaming song on here? I have that song but from the Outside bits and peices torrent.. what album do you have it on from here?
,jordack,2009-11-23T01:38Z,"i cant find the dark days score, by shadow i was wondering if anyones where i can find. will seed, always do."
,phil1fry,2010-07-03T22:59Z,"This has to be one of those boneheaded compilations. It's lacking; Endtroducing and The Outsider. His two main albums. If you're going to include all his remixes/co-produced albums where's The Private Repress?

FAIL!"
,sole420,2010-08-26T14:09Z,"Thanks for these releases in one nice package. 

Much appreciated!"
,Geeza78,2010-10-06T16:33Z,"Top man, much respect for taking the time to put up some awesome tunage...Cheers :) "
