,Athmel,2007-09-29T20:51Z,"hai guise. seed more plox. 

Anyway, I think I have an alternative. Download the 60 minute demo (which is the full game), the 1.17 patch and an old cracked exe. 

Google them.

Replace the current exe with the outdated cracked one and then use the patch to re-upgrade to 1.17.

The time constraint should stop. This isn't 100% verified but it seems to be working for me so far. 

I'm still downloading the torrent just to be safe."
,Athmel,2007-09-30T14:11Z,"Disregard that, I suck socks. 
There seems to only be 3 campaign missions."

,RavanaMaster,2007-12-23T02:38Z,"The torrent is stalled at 11.1%.  I don't think this will be re-seeded anytime soon; this is HellDrunk's only torrent, and it's 2.5 years old :("
