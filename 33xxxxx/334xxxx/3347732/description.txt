Great movie with everyone's favorite negro...funny because he is BLACK, not because he is playing a doctor, nuclear physicist, or slave.  What ever happened to black people just being black?

This has to win the award for the most freaky monster ever put in any movie...for the time, it bothered the shit out of me.  I saw it first, at the movies when I was in grade 4 lol.
