Game 7 (June 23) of the 2005 NBA Finals from an NHK Japan TV broadcast. Captured using MPEG-2 (NTSC, 720 X 480, 60 Hz, 4:3) and AC3 compression.

 The first half doesn't have any timeout footage edited out so the total image size is about a gigabyte larger than the I was hoping for.
 
 Overall, I am amazed at how many folks around the world have downloaded these things so far, from Iceland to Chile and many places in between.

 Pistons fans have gotta be proud of all their players. Except one, that is.

 Spurs fans have gotta be proud of theirs, too. And relieved that Tim Duncan made his layups and his free throws.

 For tournament MVP, I'd like to see the trophy sliced right down the middle with one half awarded to Ben Wallace and the other half awarded to Robert Horry. But perhaps the league office is a little too stern for such an approach.

Enjoy ...
