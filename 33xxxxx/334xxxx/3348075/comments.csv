,siphu,2005-06-25T14:31Z,Thanks for the torrent vonkruel. Is this the retail DVD?
,vonkruel,2005-06-25T14:49Z,"I'm not actually sure if it's retail DVD or not.  But it is DVD, and obviously it was DVD-5 to begin with (no transcoding/re-encoding required) so the quality is very good.  Not to mention that Dave is wicked funny  -- this is one of the best HBO specials ever."
