Guns n Roses Live in Montreal 1992 - Guns n Tallica stadium tour.

This show is marred by the second riot on the UYI tour. During Metallica's set, James Hetfield suffers 3rd degree burns by walking into pyrotechnics, forcing Metallica to cut their set short. During GN'R's set, Axl mentions that 'Perfect Crime' is the theme song for a movie that the band has been planning about the UYU tour. Before 'Double Talkin' Jive,' Axl says that this will be “our last show for a long fucking time.” At the end of 'Civil War,' Axl says “Thanks you, your money will be refunded, we're outta here.” An announcer comes onstage and tells the crowd that the show is over
