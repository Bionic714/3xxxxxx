Game 6 (June 21) of the 2005 NBA Finals from an NHK Japan TV broadcast. Captured using MPEG-2 (NTSC, 720 X 480, 60 Hz, 4:3) and AC3 compression.

 The audio is mostly in English with a little Japanese commentary and text.

 That's two great games in a row!
 
 What more could we ask for?
 
 As the folks in Michigan know well enough, making dire predictions about a Detroit demise is like pouring high-octane fuel over their pistons.  
 
 On a side note, I didn't know Horry was capable of throwing up 3-point bricks in crunch time; and I sure as heck wanna know if Duncan is ever gonna stop choking down the stretch. 
 
 If you got the empty space on your hardisk and a bit of patience to download, enjoy. And hope to see you again for game 7.
