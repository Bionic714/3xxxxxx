,Kaiwano,2005-06-22T01:44Z,"There! Finally got it all working...at least I know how to do until next time =D Sorry for all the inconvenience and for the double post I made before. (Btw, I have upspeed 1Mbit on my connection, so it's gonna be slow leeching until someone else can help me seed)"
,ajcactus,2005-06-23T01:45Z,"Thanx for this torrent.

I was hoping to get the one Final Fantasy song that I'm missing, but unfortunately, this song is not included here:
Final Fantasy - Legend Of The Crystals/Wind Chapter, Fire Chapter/01. Opening Theme.mp3

:-(

,Kaiwano,2005-06-23T02:09Z,That's weird...I never even heard of the album. I'll look further into it and upload a complement torrent if I find it
,Kaiwano,2005-06-23T02:18Z,"Oic, it's that anime that was made out of FF5? Yes...you're right we're missing that here. If you find and upload it plz make a comment about it here so that ppl can have their collection complete ^_^"
,Arael,2005-06-25T14:37Z,"Well, there are at least 2 ""FF Perfect Collection Supplements"", try looking there. They can be found on BoxTorrents."
,Kaiwano,2005-06-25T23:10Z,"Thank you Arael, but those two supplements are included in this collection. However, there are two other FF music downloads of interest at boxtorrents.  First we have a collection from Final Fantasy Unlimited, and then a DVD rip of The Black Mages live. When I have found the legend of the crystals OST, I will put all three in a supplement to this download, here on piratebay."

I promise I'll seed too as soon as I get the whole package downloaded (which might take a while, though).. And I'll also (naturally) let people download from me while I'm downloading in case it's needed ^_^ Keep on seeding!"

,missmyself,2006-12-29T00:26Z,"I'm currently seeding this torrent, but I was just thinking I should propably inform Kaiwano about a missing album: ""More Friends - music from Final Fantasy"". I hope you can do something about it! : )"
,Vegenoth,2007-02-04T10:43Z,"Could somebody please be so kind as to seed this torrent. The actoin mentioned above would bring further light and happiness to my day, who by the way seems to develop into an extraordirarily good day. I av stuck at 99.1 % and of some generous soul out there would please seed a little bit, I will seed it for an extensive period myself. In advance, my sincerest words of gratitude."
,Vegenoth,2007-02-04T10:46Z,"By the way, I apoligize for all the mistypes, I have not yet consumed any cofee. Ever."
,Kaiwano,2007-04-17T16:42Z," ""More Friends - music from Final Fantasy""

You seem to be correct about this one missing. Unfortunately I have not found it myself so I cannot upload it. If someone got that one or FFXII OST (FFXIII OST?) feel free to link by comment here =)"
