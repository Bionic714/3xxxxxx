Stupidity, an action-packed, comedic feature documentary opened to strong reviews in San Francisco. 
"Stupidity is clever, hilarious, and perfectly timed," said San Francisco Chronicle. "Achingly funny" writes the SF Gate. 
National Public Radio, The Toronto Star, and Montreal’s Le Devoir all called Stupidity a “hit” after the film repeatedly sold out screenings in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver and turned away thousands. The film, which recently won “Best Documentary” at the Atlantic City Film Festival, attempts to answer the question of how when humanity is so advanced, can ignorance and stupidity be so rampant?

Stupidity reveals:

Very little is know about human stupidity
STUPIDITY may be the driving force of humankind.
The SHOCKING origins of the words moron, imbecile and idiot.
Stupidity is fueled by strong belief systems, left or right, and often smart people are the stupidest

The documentary also demonstrates the academic world has studiously avoided the topic of stupidity. Commissioned by the Documentary Channel and the CBC, Stupidity features interviews with Bill Maher, Selma Hayek, Noam Chomsky, and John Cleese. Directed by Trailervision founder Albert Nerenberg, the feature length documentary is poised for a full US release.
