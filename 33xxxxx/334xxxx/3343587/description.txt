This is a pack of awesome simfiles for Stepmania. Why are they awesome? Because I am awesome, and if I think something is awesome, then it is awesome. There are some relatively unknown files in here, as well as some popular ones. There is also quite a bit of new material by me - new, unreleased sims, as well as edits on a few of the other sims. This is not 100% compatible with DWI because some sims only have SM files, and also, some have EDIT steps.
