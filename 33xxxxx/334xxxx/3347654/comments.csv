,dohdoh,2005-06-23T06:07Z,are the group 2 performances going to be put up? it seems silly to have the results without the performances.....
,dragonstorm,2005-06-23T06:49Z,"Group 2 performances are here now.

There seems to be a slight audio sync problem at the beginning of part 1 (which is really just the preamble to the results anyway.)

I may post a better version if I come across one."
