,vandank,2005-06-21T04:34Z,Have to say 851 Mb doesn't look like DVD contents. But I guess it's because it's a short movie...
,Tourniquest,2005-06-21T08:09Z,ratDVD should have its own category... at least when it is developed enough to work properly.
,Tourniquest,2005-06-21T08:12Z,The danger with ratDVD is that we're going to get a lot of DVDs compressed to ratDVD then encoded back to DVD - with a degradation in quality - and then posted as DVDs. :(
,copro,2005-06-21T10:42Z,"Tourniquest is probably right, but there are huge advantages for people not knowing how to play / burn DVD. Its easier to just click on the .ratDVD file in the explorer and then let Windows Media Player do the job. Also the nice cover view in the Thumbnail view of the player. The most important thing is that its just one file and the filesize is mostly under 2 GB - so nobody should habe a problem with that . there is also no need to strip other addons of Special Edition DVDs and Editor Cuts, etc... . Perhaps there even will be linux or macOS ports for the software ... for now just a test and with limited upload capacities probably a good choice."

,copro,2005-07-18T01:04Z,Das zeigt nur dass niemand mehr bereit iss was zu lesen. Aus dem komprimierten ratDVD Format kann man wieder eine komplette DVDR machen und brennen. Wenn man Lust hat und lesen kann :P
