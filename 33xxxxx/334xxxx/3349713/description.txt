By 1957 Pat Boone's popularity had skyrocketed and the movie and television producers began to come calling. He appeared in 15 films, including Bernardine, April Love, and State Fair. From 1957 to 1960 he hosted his own television series The Pat Boone/Chevy Showroom. He somehow managed to finish his degree, graduating from Columbia University in New York City in 1958. And all the while, the hits kept coming: Why Baby Why, Love Letters In The Sand [which held the number one spot for seven weeks], and April Love [number one for six weeks] were huge hits in 1957. The following year he continued to put records in the top ten, including A Wonderful Time Up There and Sugar Moon.
