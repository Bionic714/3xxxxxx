Rip Notes
---------

Fixed lame headers. Now on to the 2nd issue the ying yang.

First of all this is not hate, attacking, unnuke request, etc. anything negative.
It's a valid nuke don't get me wrong if you consider the filenames dupe and the 
proper doesn't get spread properly on a courier's prospective.
So we'll adapt to this "new" rule thanks.

If nukers are going to start nuking propers with same filename naming scheme, then
please enforce it.

EGO's C-Murder proper had the same filenames as the first rip, was it nuked? no heh.
Just like a lawyer would say: 
"My defendant is accused of these charges, but in the case of Joe Blow all charges were dropped"
