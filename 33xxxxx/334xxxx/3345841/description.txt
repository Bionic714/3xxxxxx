I noticed a while ago that unixpunix.org (or the BSDeviant crew) put down the website for this Live-CD distrubution based on FreeBSD. That made me sad, and when the site did not come up later either I decided to share the CD-image I had on this site :)
Enjoy! that's an order! (it's my first torrent ever, please be gentle)
