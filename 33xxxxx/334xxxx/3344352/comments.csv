,stans,2005-06-16T01:57Z,this is for psx not ps2!
,twen,2005-06-16T04:54Z,"You're an idiot, this torrent website does not have a PSX section, PSX games run fine on PS2, and my NFO clearly states that it's a PSX game. Screw off."
,twen,2005-06-18T05:14Z,"Uh...ALL PS2s can read PSX games, stock or not. Get the hell out of my torrent."
,stans,2005-06-21T04:29Z,"woO...look at me! I'm soO special. I post my psx torrent in ps2 section coz i'm so special. People post in the OTHER section but since i'm such an attention whore my torrent deserves to be in the PS2 section. woO-woO...

Also, i'm so smart i can take my psx download, just burn it on CDR and shove it into my stock ps2 and it boots and plays! Don't need nothing else!"
,akinara,2005-06-21T11:29Z,"You need to stop being an ass towards people who post quality torrents. PSX games are better off in the ps2 section anyway.

Watch out though twen, these guys might actually make their way into bemaniso."
,swbluto,2005-07-27T13:04Z,"How do you guys play these games without an internal mod chip? I have an Action Replay(gold shark-like device) and a PS1, but I need a protection fix Patch to play it... how are you playing this game?"
