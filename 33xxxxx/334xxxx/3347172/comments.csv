,tristan202,2005-07-25T22:57Z,"no problem at all. actually i just made this for myself, but my friends said i should relase it to the general public, while we are waiting for the Closure DVD, which hopefully contains Broken on disc 2. I'm pretty sure that's the reason it's been delayed for so long."
