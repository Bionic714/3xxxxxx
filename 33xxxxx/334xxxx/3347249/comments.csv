,macArthurDent,2005-06-22T10:44Z,Just a PC-Version. Not a Mac Game

,Broadband,2005-06-23T01:06Z,"Probably because in the drop down box right below PC is MAC.  They should allow you to update your torrents and this wouldn't have been an issue.

I have been told that this can run in Virtual PC but haven't tested it myself."

,Exposing_bad_shards,2006-09-26T22:22Z,"Obsidian the last iteration of UO?  This shard uses a UO client that can only be called ancient,  it's so old they have to offer the download themselves.  It also runs on an outdated emulator.

I'll point out that Broadband also ""forgot"" to mention that this shard is plagued with cheaters and corrupt staff.  Never mind the rules clearly state, in caps, that there is ZERO tolerance for cheating, you have GM's that aqre allowed to show their banned buddies how to circumvent their IP range ban, staff that are allowed to abuse their power, players who outright brag about how often they've been banned.  And obviously, nothing that makes them want to not cheat...

This shard could be ok if it were not run by a corrupt liar.  As the chineese saying goes: ""fish stink from the head"".  If you don't enjoy playing with cheaters, staff that will abuse their powers or just beeing lied to, then you'll find this to be a bad shard. 

But not to worry, there are hundreds of free UO shards out there.  Just look up UO topsites in Google."
