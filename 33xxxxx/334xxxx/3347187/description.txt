Just a little batch file to clean up the MilkDrop Presets that KevinSartori released yesterday.
[http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3346594]

This deletes 80 Preset files that appear 2 or 3 times - leaving one intact.
The Presets in my Releases are "PreCleaned" ofcoz ;-)
But I generated this anyhow, so why not share it.

Instructions:

1. Unzip MilkDrop.zip to a Temp Dir
2. Copy this Batch File to Temp Dir
3. Execute this Batch File
4. Delete this Batch File
5. ReZIP all Presets to MilkDrop.zip (Preferrably using STORE "Compression" only)
