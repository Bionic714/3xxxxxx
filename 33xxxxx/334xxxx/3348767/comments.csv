,Crash613,2011-06-26T03:29Z,"did you steal this from Ateuz or him from you?  these are the exact same episodes, even same file names, as the entire series uploaded by Ateuz.

Either way, thanks, but the quality of this season sucks.  hope to find a better copy."
,clearlyvague,2011-12-01T04:31Z,"thanks again for another season uploaded and for contributing to my oz marathon. for those of you complaining about the video quality not being that great, have some gratitude. it's free, and as Ibag said, ""it's OZ man. OZ."" good upload speed and connected to over 20 seeders, way more than it said this link had."
