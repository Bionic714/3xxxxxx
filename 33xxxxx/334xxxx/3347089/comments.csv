,iLLuMNaTi,2005-06-23T07:43Z,"LOL! you can download this from microsoft at 200+ KB/s all day long, every day, 24/7, why in the world would someone make this into a torrent?"
,aramandai,2005-06-24T05:53Z,Thanks for sharing. Nice for those who have modified version of XP and can't download.
,boncuklar,2005-07-08T02:28Z,"And to iLLuMNaTi: I could not download it form ms site, coz they told me my serial/nr is not valid. Well here is the story: a couple of years ago I bought a pc with homexp on it. Here in my country they didn't give away xp discs when you bought a new computer, it was built in in your pc's harddisk and you could restore it from there. But after my harddisk crashed, I had lost it. Calling ms about it did not help, so the only thing I could do is 'borrowing' from a friend a cracked version. I still see it as legal, coz I paid for windows xp when I bought the pc. It was a difference of around 100 euro if I remember correctly. So now I cannot download the latest drivers from ms, who cares? Thnx a bunch to the torrent community..."
