,jagerteen,2009-07-03T19:49Z,How do you watch these movies on HP Vista? Do you need a converter or VLC media player? How do you do it? Im so new at this. Please help OuO
,sonoreo,2010-12-29T00:40Z,"nice, Took about an hour, tops. Considering I used High bandwidth location. Quality 9/10 due to the fact that this is a bit of an old movie and it could use a bit of higher quality, but it's very good the way it is, and I wouldn't worry about it for those who havent downloaded yet."
,jwillrmmg,2011-03-11T14:01Z,Thanks again. Awesome quality!
,littlecookie,2011-05-15T12:38Z,"Thanks for the upload! Excellent quality! Though you need to turn up your speakers since the sound isn't that hard, worth giving a try! :)"

Bud Light Presents: Real Men of Genius
>Real Men of Genius!
Today we salute you, Mr. Tech-help seeking torrent commenter.
>Mr. Tech-help seeking torrent commenter!
To solve her tech problems my grandma learned to build her own computer. You think there is no other way to watch movies than Windows Media Player.
>Guys help it doesn't work!
All of human knowledge at your disposal, and you can't even bring yourself to use google or wikipedia to view your pirated media.
>I'm getting audio but no video!
All those people leaving comments that actually help other people? Nerds.
>I bet they use linux!
You ask for help to do the most basic things on dozens of torrents you never seed, and if someone suggests you look up what a â€œcodecâ€ is, your pent-up angst is unleashed.
>You're just like my father!
So crack open an ice-cold Bud Light, oh semi-sentient cyber supplicant, because without you the RIAA wouldn't have any low-hanging fruit to go after.
