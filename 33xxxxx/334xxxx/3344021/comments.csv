,thelolkiller,2007-03-14T20:38Z,You guys actually don't listen to hip-hop right? Eminem is the most selling rapper ever.. and Dr.Dre did not try to diss Eminem and is not fucking jelous Dr.Dre was the one who discovered Eminem and made his first LP. Snoop Dog and Ice Cube are just fake rappers.

,Reggeaton,2009-06-11T18:56Z,Hope this is good quality(video)
,Ultima84,2009-12-16T18:06Z,"DON'T DOWNLOAD! - Guys this is an extremly poor torrent, video is horribly pixelated not to mention the sound quality! I had to actually repair the file within VLC before being able to access the video.

If this is indeed a DVD rip on your part, then shame on you! Learn to convert quality media before creating/uploading torrents...ASSH0LE

One more thing, I actually just registered after being angered by this 'nonoteams' crap torrent to warn you guys! 'Nono you don't even deserve to own this DVD "

,orangepillow85,2009-12-19T07:49Z,"@jamesjohn911
Eazy e actually put together nwa under ruthless records and began the gangsta rap phenomenon, dre would have evntually sparked but without E it woulda taken years considering b4 nwa he was only a dj at local compton clubs!! i love both but if i had to chose id take E any day, cuz he aint no studio gangsta and takes shit hardcore!!!"
