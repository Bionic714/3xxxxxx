Yiddish is Forever / Jewish Songs /http://www.yiddish-is-forever.com
Jacqui Sussholz is full of surprises. He's a diamond dealer in Antwerp - and he sings like an angel. 
He sings traditional Yiddish and Hassidic songs - with brilliant arrangements that transcend categories.. 
He's proud to be Jewish - but he's reaching out to the world. He performs in English, French, Dutch,
German, Hebrew - and, of course, Yiddish.
 
Jacqui is a born artist, a natural all-round performer who has recorded 3 CDs and created his own 
one-man show Yiddish is Forever. 
He sings, he tells stories, he can make you laugh, he can break your heart.. 
And everything he does, he does with passion; he lives each moment to the full. 
You can sense that in every song he sings and every story he tells - hilarious monologues, 
Woody Allen style, about his own life. 
The full stage show blends the music and the humour to create great entertainment: 
it has played to packed, enthusiastic audiences in Belgium, France and Germany .
He has now adapted a smaller-scale version for private functions, based on humorous stories of his 
experiences in the diamond world. 
'It's doing great with all audiences' he says. 
'And I can put it on anywhere. So long as the technical backup - sound system, etc. - is professional'
 
What's a diamond dealer doing in showbiz, you may ask? 'My mother's always asking that' Jacqui says. 
'You spend all your time and money on singing, she says. What will become of you? So I say, 
'Listen. Other guys in business, when they want a break, they drink, they gamble, they keep a fancy 
mistress somewhere. 
So what should I do?' And she gives me a look and says, 'Sing, Jacqui, sing!"
 
And that's what he does - with a warmth and humanity that will touch the hearts of audiences 
everywhere.
