Get A Clue tells the story of a budding teen-aged gossip columnist working for her high-school newspaper. When a teacher disappears from campus, Lexy changes hats and becomes an investigative reporter. Teaming up with Jack (Bug Hall, "Adam Szalinski" in Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves and "Buster Stupid" in The Stupids), a hard-nosed reporter from her paper, Lexy will work to sniff out the villain, uncover the mystery, and rescue her teacher.


iNFO: yes. This movie is 1h22min 1cd with ac3 audio. Def not scene standard. But this isnt released for the scene. This movie is a low motion movie, and with todays codecs, the quality is fair enough with one cd. Go get a scene release if this isnt good for you! :)
