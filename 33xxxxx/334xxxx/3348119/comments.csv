To listen to this album you need a DTS decoder and a 5.1 system."
,rogermoor,2005-06-24T16:58Z,I get a message stating that the file is corrupt :-((
,torarnes,2005-06-24T18:03Z,"Source file is OK, just converted it to a NERO-image (*.nrg) with UltraISO, mounted it in my virtual CD and listened to it, with VLC player."
,Beaverlicker,2005-06-25T00:59Z,This is Bullshit!!!It is a joke!!!
,Beaverlicker,2005-06-25T04:11Z,Sorry!!!!hehehe...er...actually...it works pefectly!!!You simply open the gi file with Ultraiso and extract to a folder thats it!!when I converted to an Iso file it didnt work!!!
,rogermoor,2005-06-25T10:24Z,"I just needed to update my old version of UltraISO to the new version and voila - works perfectly - and a very very good sound.

What prog is needed to make DTS-sound ??"

,GARDENS,2005-07-11T13:10Z,AM I STUPID? IVE TRIED ULTRAISO AND CONVERTED TO A NERO FILE. ALL I GET IS WHITE NOISE. HELP!!!!!!
,valius,2005-07-17T09:10Z,"Play with WinDVD Platinum.
TNX for torrent!"
,rendezvous,2005-07-30T16:35Z,"Can someone confirm... is this the official DTS 5.1 DVD-Audio release, or is this another repack of the old vinyl quad release?"
,Casperius,2005-07-31T17:02Z,"It works just fine if you do it right! Use for example RecordNow! software to burn it to cd. To play it; use a stand-alone DVD-player connected to a home-cinema sound-systen. Make sure that it is a DIGITAL connection between DVD-player and Amp! If you use analouge connection you will only hear digital noise and probably damage your speakers! It sounds ok this CD, but I'm sure the SACD sounds better. Cool to hear it in 5.1 even though it's not a very dynamic mix.
Thank's for the upload!  =)"
