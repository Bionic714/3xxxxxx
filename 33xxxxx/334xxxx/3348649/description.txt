The Complete Discography of Weird Al Yankovic.
Many other discographys only contain 6 or 8 of his albums.

This Release Contains All 11 Studio Albums:
"Weird Al" Yankovic [1983]
In 3D [1984]
Dare To Be Stupid [1985]
Polka Party [1986]
Even Worse [1988]
UHF [1989]
Off The Deep End [1992]
Alapalooza [1993]
Bad Hair Day [1996]
Running With Scissors [1999]
Poodle Hat [2003]

It Also Contains the "Special Project" Peter And The Wolf [1988], as well as 3 extra tracks not included on any studio albums (Headline News, Spy Hard, and Polkamon).

The only thing this release does not include which were officially released are the "Cheesy Compilations" albums.  These are greatest hits or topic centered albums (Food, TV Albums) which contain random tracks from the studio albums but no new material.  No need to grab the same tracks 3 and 4 times.

FYI - These aren't my rips.  They are all at least 128 kbps (some are better).  The files had the tags stripped and the ID3v1 tags recreated to make things more uniform and strip out the comment spam and stuff.

Check out the tracks.pdf file!  It has a listing of all of his tracks including which are parodies and the artist and track that each song is a parody of.

More info in readme.nfo.  Enjoy!
