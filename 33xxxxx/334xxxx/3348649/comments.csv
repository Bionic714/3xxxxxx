,herbman75,2006-03-13T14:59Z,"Thanks so much for this darth! This is one of the coolest parts of my music library now. Weird Al has been a hero of mine ever since I was a child. When the whole world was sucking up to Michael Jackson back in the 80's, I used to think Weird Al and me were the only two people in the world who thought he sucked and deserved to be ridiculed. Al and his accordian were way ahead of their time in that regard... Long live this primo polka party!!!"
