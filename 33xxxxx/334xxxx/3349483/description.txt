SEEDING OF A GHOST aka Black Magic 3. UNCUT mega-disgusting 
Asian pukeathon from those inscrutable Shaw Bros. Features rampant nekkidity, 
bug barfing, brain eating, spinal column popping, airborne celestial corpse screwing, 
ass reaming with a giant matchstick, an exploding pregnant woman 
(sort of a "womb with a spew") and a multi-tentacled face hugger with a very big 
appetite. Truly amazing -- you will NOT be disappointed! 

Rippers notes:
DVDR from an obvious VHS source.  Don't expect top quality, however
this rarity deserves to be seen.  Personally, the first 1/2 hour did nothing for
me, then it just went insane.  Great stuff, and a must for asian horror or
Shaw Bros. completists.  It's the best print around right now from what I
am told.
