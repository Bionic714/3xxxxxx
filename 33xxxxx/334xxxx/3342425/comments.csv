,vonkruel,2005-06-09T19:02Z,great upload - will seed thanks
,UKK,2005-06-09T19:06Z,been searching for this...seeds...
,PinkSpider,2005-06-09T19:11Z,"It's working? 

Sorry, I'm kind of half-insane at the moment due to some personal problems heh. And this is my first time uploading."
,UKK,2005-06-09T19:55Z,0 seeds...
,PinkSpider,2005-06-09T20:00Z,"Damnit. >_<
I'll try and figure out how to seed, doh. Any tips are welcome"
,PinkSpider,2005-06-09T20:13Z,I chose Seed in BitLord and thought there was nothing more to it?
,UKK,2005-06-09T20:49Z,"http://www.bitlord.com/FAQ.php
but I would suggest you change to Azureus
http://azureus.sourceforge.net/"
,PinkSpider,2005-06-09T20:49Z,I usually use Azureus actually.
,PinkSpider,2005-06-09T20:51Z,There's nothing worse than looking like a friggin n00b. *furious* >_<;;
,PinkSpider,2005-06-09T20:53Z,"Ok, I didn't locate the correct folder. Now it should be working soon I hope.

Sorry about all this crap. ^_^;;"
,UKK,2005-06-09T21:08Z,":) bygone... I really can't help, because I don't upload anything because of the slow connection...
still showing 0 seeds... :)"
,UKK,2005-06-09T21:13Z,It's working :)
,vonkruel,2005-06-09T21:42Z,Looks like you got it figured out :)  Thanks for making the effort to upload - too many ppl take take take and never give.
,PinkSpider,2005-06-09T22:07Z,"No problem, I have more on the way. Like in a few days or something.

I hope the speed is alright for now? It should be fairly good seeing as I have 8 or 10mbit broadband and the upload shouldn't be too bad."
,PinkSpider,2005-06-11T16:42Z,"I'll appreciate if someone of you seeds, because my upload is a total of 3mb/s right now =P and it's been around 1-2 all the time."
,PinkSpider,2005-06-12T00:17Z,Yeah I can see that at least one got it.
,Pundan,2005-06-12T11:37Z,"Hahahaha Barry Lajnwand, trevligt. Den killen har jag bråkat en hel del med. Han är inte längre inom trading kretsarna, han har blivit utesluten :D"
,vonkruel,2005-06-13T02:12Z,seeding now - thanks again
,fietsband,2005-06-16T08:31Z,I've been looking for such a upload of Nirvana. So thanks!!
,Agurken,2005-06-27T22:24Z,Konge Torrent mange takk =)
,Caramba-,2005-06-27T23:07Z,Måste man bränna det här på två dvd skivor eller kan man slå ihop det på en skiva?
,PinkSpider,2005-06-30T13:28Z,I think you have to put it on two DVDs.
,PinkSpider,2005-06-30T13:29Z,Thanks for Seeding btw.
,stones7000,2005-08-07T03:08Z,"Finns den att köpa, seedarna suger fett"
,stones7000,2005-08-07T03:15Z,"verkar som om man kan sluta seeda HÄR, ingen annan verkar ju bry sig"
,stones7000,2005-08-07T03:16Z,"0,0 b/s"
,Mirbacher88,2006-01-08T20:52Z,Fantastiskt Bra / Tack
,dennnis,2006-01-11T00:01Z,"Please respond, seeders! :)"
,muad_dib77,2006-04-12T23:19Z,So hey... what's the uncut bit... Are there extra comments between tracks?
,ScorpioTiger,2006-05-09T21:11Z,Be warned guys. This is actually 2 DVDs of about 2.2gig each....god knows why it wasn't authored as one DVD.  The quality is also so poor as to make it unwatchable in some parts...what's the point of watching a live performance if you can't even see the faces clearly?
,PinkSpider,2006-05-14T00:25Z,"Oops, the 40-70kb/s bit was the speed that _I'm_ getting."
,cainc5,2007-04-19T17:36Z,"Low quality rip from video, two 2gb dvds..
=/"
,runkill.com,2007-09-19T02:36Z,"That sucks, I was planning on turning it into a HQ DivX release."
,egeorge,2008-04-11T01:47Z,"If you like Nirvana, do NOT download this, you are going to be dissapointed because the low quality video. It was my mistake for not reading previous comments."
,gboys,2010-03-03T13:53Z,"On this page http://www.taringa.net/posts/musica/4654505/Nirvana-Unplugged-In-New-York-Uncut-DVDR-9-%5BMU%5D.html you have links to 7.2gb version and on this one http://www.taringa.net/posts/downloads/3841835/Nirvana-Unplugged-%281994%29-DVD-FULL.html there is 4.3gb version.Use Jdownloader and winrar ,links won't always be valid,so keep torrents alive."
