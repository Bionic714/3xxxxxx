,waerwie,2006-01-21T12:53Z,"i usually don't complain, but when I am stuck on 99.9% for the second day I am starting to get a little worried that I will never get this files down. I am 2 mb from having the complete file so if anyone has it it would be nice if they shared for 5 min or so, so I can begin to share the hole file and hopefully also view the season."
