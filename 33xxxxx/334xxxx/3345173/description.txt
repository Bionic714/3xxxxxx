A Day Later and another season. If any of you watched the show, you know it took forever to put out a nenw season. Sopranos forever. God Dam HBO. You also did'nt miss Season two, I Cant get to the HD that its on (god Damn rabbit chewed through the USB wire when noone was looking.) Hopefully I can get it tommorow and then put up season two, I just wanted to keep everything moving alon, know what I mean.
Until next time
