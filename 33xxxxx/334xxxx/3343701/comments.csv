,iloveguts,2009-01-22T22:01Z,"This is a dead torrent people.  No one has seeded 
for a very long time.  This is what happens 
when people don't seed what they download.

times.

I must be hungry, brb."
,dielaughing,2009-01-28T20:57Z,"%81.3 .. and a LOT of %81.3's out there.. can't one person seed this? Is it too much to ask to help a torrent live? Come on people.. there has to be someone .. .. I see it's been a long time that this was created.. but if TPB user, torrent uploader Catasexual is still online will you help out your torrent here? And if no one seeds this, if it can't be helped, just kill it.. remove it so a bunch of %81.3 seeders out there arernt sitting and staring at the monitor, like a dumb animal caught in a vehicle's headlights..."

I have a lot of these personally on hrddrive, will look at making them available in the next 3 weeks (not so tech minded, very busy).

So there may be hope for complete albums.
