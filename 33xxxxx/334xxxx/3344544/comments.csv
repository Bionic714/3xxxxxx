Let me guess :
You are trying to use a Skin that is too old for this Release.
You copied your old skin into this new Releases Skin Directory to keep using it - and you did not delete your old XBMCÂ´s settings ?
What happens is : Fresh XBMC starts - using your old Preferences and tries to load the too old skin. 
Delete the XBMCÂ´s SaveGame using the Micro$oft Dashboard !!!
Alternatively you can just delete the E:TDATA face008 and E:UDATA face008 directories !!!

XBMC will then use the Provided PMIII skin and all will be fine.
Get a newer Version of your favorite skin.
Be careful if you want to use your old XboxMediaCenter.xml
Read my NFO !!! ;-)
Hope this helps"
