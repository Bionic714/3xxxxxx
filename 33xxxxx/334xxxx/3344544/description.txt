    INFORMATION:

    This package is my little "contribution" to the scene.
    Hope you like it ... Comments & Suggestions are very welcome !
    If ppl find this useful, im gonna try releasing on a weekly basis.

    I only included the Original Project Mayhem III skin from the CVS to
    keep the Release Size small and to make sure everything works perfectly.

    Scripts included:
    FlexiBrowser / GameSaves / GameSpotPlus / GameTrailers / iFilmBrowser
    StupidVideos / QuickTimeBrowser (Movie Trailers) / simpleKML V2 (WebRadio) 

    I modified the SkinProject Mayhem IIIPALDialogSubMenu.xml so that all
    of the Scripts appear in the Scripts Submenu. If you don´t like this or
    some of the Scripts, you should edit this file to your personal preferences.
    The original file from CVS is also still present as DialogSubMenu.xml.ORG.

    Visualization addons included:
    G-Force: 1510 total (including the 490 CVS supplied ones)
    Milkdrop: 4037 total (including the 436 CVS supplied ones)
    These were all the Presets i could find ... All Presets are zipped.
    Just in case, the Original CVS Presets are backed up to folders
    visualisationsG-ForceOriginal Files from CVS
    visualisationsMilkdropOriginal Files from CVS

    CHANGELOG:

    To keep this .nfo shorter, I only provide you with the last 3 lines here
    so you can see what´s included. You can find the official XBMC Changelog at  
    http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/xbmc/XBMC/Changelog.txt?view=markup
    It is also included in docsChangelog.txt
 
   - 14-06-2005 updated: mplayer.dll
     (fixes 2x playback speed when volume amplification was enabled)
   - 14-06-2005 fixed: possible crash in zip file handler.
   - 14-06-2005 changed: weather pictures now in weather.zip (currently disabled).

    Some TIPS:

    If you are experiencing all kinda weird problems using an updated version
    of XBMC it is always a good idea to delete the XBMC´s SaveGame
    using the Micro$oft Dashboard. Alternatively you can just delete the
    E:TDATA face008 and E:UDATA face008 directories.
    This is especially the case if you are updating from quite an old version.

    To avoid problems you should also check with every new release if the
    included XboxMediaCenter.xml has changed significantly.
    You should then update your own XboxMediaCenter.xml accordingly.

    There seems to be a bug introduced by using the latest Mplayer.dll.
    For now don´t use the "Film Grain Effect" or movies won´t play anymore. 
    I´m pretty sure the developers will fix this quite soon ;-)

    THANKS:

    All the XBMC developers !!
    Your program makes the XBOX worth soOo much more for all of us !
    Everyone contributing to the scene !
    This would not have been possible without some guy (he didn´t leave a name)
    releasing the "MakeXBMC Essential Files Package". Thanks Mate !

    PS: By now, everyone and his grandma should know that the Milkdrop
    and the G-Force presets too, can (and really should !) be zipped up ;-)
    If they aren´t, your beloved XBOX will eat your HDD and slow to a crawl
    when using all the available "Milkdrop addon" presets.
