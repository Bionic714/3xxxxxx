,IvanOverkill,2005-06-26T15:08Z,"Doesn't this belong in GAMES, not APPS?"
,xnixiel,2005-06-26T16:37Z,does it work ? :p
,penisbird,2005-06-26T17:32Z,"whoops. sorry for the wrong category. I actually had a really good writeup and had it in the correct category the first time around but i mistyped the captcha and it erased EVERYTHING I had written and so I had to start from scratch.

next time I'll put it in a rar file too."
,xnixiel,2005-06-26T21:49Z,"this rocks so much, thanks :)"
,iLLuMNaTi,2005-06-27T06:57Z,"I'm glad you accidentally put it in here because I never DL games, but I like this classic game. I would never have DLed it because I never would see it because I don't look in the games area here. I only look in apps 95% of the time. Thank you for the upload!"
,bigmikedmb,2006-02-07T23:37Z,"I Dl this and extracted it, but why does it end in .iso? Its an image file and i cant run it...."
,hoxel,2006-02-08T08:56Z,"It doesnt work for me in windows XP=(
""C:/windows/system32/autoexec.nt. The system file is not suitable for running MS.DOS and Windows applications. Choose close to terminate the application""

Am I doing something wrong or?"

,Tsatie,2007-06-12T23:39Z,"I have downloaded SimCity 2000, now how do I get it installed on my computer? I am new at this. Could someone please help me....."
,Tsatie,2007-06-12T23:58Z,"I am running WinXP as well. Someone please help me, I love this game."
,ckcelite,2007-09-04T05:37Z,"For those of you wishing to play this and other legacy games, you might try DOSBOX
. do a search for it in google"
,the-ipod-men,2008-02-11T23:33Z,seed seed seed......please.....
,Kilyle,2008-04-06T14:35Z,"The only thing I know of that ends in .ISO is an image of a Playstation game, suitable for playing in a Playstation (PSX) emulator.  Perhaps try that?  It certainly wouldn't be the same as ""The Windows version,"" though...."
,sayeo87,2008-05-02T17:31Z,I can run the game but it has no sound. Anybody else have this problem?
,arnham,2008-10-10T07:12Z,"If you want a version that works on windows x64 (XP or Vista), I uploaded a version that will. Should also work fine on 32 bit systems. Note that my version does NOT have an installer and entails adding some registry entries. I've included the necessary registry file, so it should be a snap if you follow my instructions properly.

,everettpf3,2009-02-07T11:27Z,"Some of the comments on here are so bad they're funny. Dosbox for a windows game? c'mon, read the description, "
,mdp1632,2009-12-13T20:01Z,".ISO is an extension for disc image files. Use an appropriate CD burning program to write the image to a disc. Alternatively, you could use DaemonTools to mount the image to a virtual disk drive."
,jag420,2011-03-09T05:13Z,works fine. running windows 7 and it works perfect.
