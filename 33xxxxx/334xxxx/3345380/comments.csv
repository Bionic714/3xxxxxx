Well...then again they started two world wars and lost both, who can blame them."
,eyesmoker1911,2005-06-17T08:09Z,"@KalleKofot
You are wrong. The germans did not start WW 1. Go check a history book!
Furthermore german is not the worst language. They had the best poets and german is the most precise language of the world.
Besides... english has its roots in german. Many words are still the same."
