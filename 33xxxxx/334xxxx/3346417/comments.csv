,maple_leaf,2005-06-22T00:28Z,"this is a starforce protection yes, have tried DL a ""crack"" from gamecopy world, but the game craches when the main meny appears"
,geleaktig,2005-06-22T19:59Z,"there is only one way to get rid of starforce, and that's by downloading something called starforce nightmare. There should me a so called ""mini-image"" in this DL, i myself haven't yet downloaded it. But there should be. Anyway, mount the images, install the game, run Starforce Nightmare and turn off all your physical CD-drives, then mount the mini-image and GO GO GO. :P 

that SHOULD do the trick. If it doesn't i shall return with info :o"

First start sf nightmare, and press in the left side of the screen "" Disable cd ""... Then copy sd4hide in your game folder, and start this file. Than press "" hide "" and start the game... Enjoy!!! And sorry about my bad English... Bye :))))"
