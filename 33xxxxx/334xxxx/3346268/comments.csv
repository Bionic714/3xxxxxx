,suppafly,2005-06-19T06:21Z,This is the link to the original DVD: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0783233485/qid=1119154931/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-7283500-3378337?v=glance&s=dvd

,dirtydeeds,2005-06-19T07:07Z,Awsome! Keep them coming! Rat is the only way to go!
,bruceball,2005-06-19T19:16Z,"Wrong category.

This is NOT DVD.

Even after re-encoding back to true DVD, the quality will be nothing compared to DVDR."
,suppafly,2005-06-19T19:53Z,"Fuck you bruceball. Sincerely: Suppafly. If you dont like this FREE download, then dont use it. FUCK YOU. :D"
,shortjohn,2005-06-19T21:11Z,bruceball: dont like it? buy the fucker!
,prvt8,2005-06-22T07:30Z,"You can burn it  onto it a DVD, play it on your standalone DVD player, navigate the menu and select the extras.  That makes it a DVD.  Which other category does this belong in?  The non-existent ratDVD category?  The video category with the avi files?  Give me a break.  "
,bruceball,2005-06-22T16:37Z,"prvt8: like ratdvds, you can re-encode divxs/xvids back to mpeg2 and burn them in dvd video format. You can then watch them with your standalone player. There should be a separate section for ratdvds. In the meantime ratdvds should be in movies category since the picture quality is on a par with xvids. Some people seem to misconceive ratdvd as a revolutionary compression method for dvds (like ape/flac for audio), which it isnt. There's a whole lot of hype and buzz going on. The bubble will burst sooner than later."
,prvt8,2005-06-22T19:57Z,"Decompressing a ratDVD is not nearly the same as converting an mpeg-4 video as the latter won't have  muliple audio, extra scenes, and other bonus material.  As for the difference in video quality between a ratDVD and a true DVD, you probably can't tell the difference with most TVs.  A ratDVD is much closer to a DVD than an avi so it belongs in this category.  In addition, it's clearly labelled so there's no doubt what you're getting.  "
,suppafly,2005-06-22T22:52Z,Im really sorry for not finishing uploading this game. My hard disk crashed. I tried to recover the information but most of it was lost. The rar files I was uploading got corrupted. Seems likes its impossible for me to continue this upload. IM really sorry. I will try to make the ratdvd from this dvd again in the following days. (I bought a new hard disk so there should be no problems now). Sorry for your lost time...
,crocked,2005-06-22T22:54Z,"Can you seed please, we have been at 37.5 % for days
thanks for the upload."
,crocked,2005-06-22T23:02Z,Sorry to hear about your hard drive. Hope you are sorted soon.
,boogerup,2005-07-09T16:13Z,"The nice thing about RatDVD is that it encodes all the content of the DVD directly - menus, extras, etc. The quality also isn't bad - like a good XVid and definitely better than a VCD."
,boogerup,2005-07-09T16:16Z,I have a RatDVD with multiple audio and extra scenes (though it's for Versus and it only has trailers and commentaries as extra) as well as different subtitle choices.
,larry5X,2009-02-18T07:08Z,"how does one burn this? i never heard of a ratdvd and nero doesnt know what to do with it.........
