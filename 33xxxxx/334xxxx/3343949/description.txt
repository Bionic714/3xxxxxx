One of my favourite version of the Need 4 Speed releases to date. I liked part 2. But I liked this one more for some reason. Had cop pursuit in this, and the back ground music was great. Compared to now. I think I like this more. Anyways here's the release for all those slow computers out there lol to play. Enjoy the game. It for Windows, PC.

I always prefer posting an information link on my releases, I don't know why demonoid didn't make it mandatory, other websites like mininova have it already. Anyways as always please post my torrent on other websites. You can use bitlord and add additional trackers to the one you are already downloading.

Enjoy!!!
