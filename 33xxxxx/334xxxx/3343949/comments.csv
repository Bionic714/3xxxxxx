reply plz. plz. plz.  Thanks"
,tmjam2002,2005-07-01T00:30Z,if you want to burn the CD. Just download Daemon from daemon tools. And mount the cue file. After it's mounted as a virtual drive use any CD/DVD burning software and burn the mounted drive. Easy
,Prodigy_000,2005-07-17T18:42Z,"I installed the game and even burnt the file to a dvd but still whenever I try to play it, it says insert the correct cd/dvd and restart application. Anyone else having the same problem and noe what 2 do?"

,TurboAudi,2009-01-27T17:54Z,"For Vista users, I don't think this works.  Everything installs and starts up thanks to your 

instructions tmjam2002, but when you pick your car, track, and what not, when you select 

race it goes to the load screen with the car and the red bar loads up fully then freezes.  have 

to go to task manager and it says application not responding and have to end task.  if 

anyone has a work around for vista let me 
know.  i have xp partitioned and someone 

already said it works on xp so i am going to play it thru xp.  
Thanks for the upload tmjam2002 keep 'em coming!"
