::| Already at an early age, I began my musical journey. At five years I    |::
::| couldnt keep my hands of the piano.At the age of 19, I discovered the   |::
::| underground parties and clubs. At that time trance didnt really exist,  |::
::| it was progressive acid house that filled the air. The music,           |::
::| atmosphere and clubbing crowd inspired me to begin making my own music  |::
::| again. When I purchased an Atari computer and some simple synthesisers, |::
::| my music began taking form.In the beginning of 1996 I released, under   |::
::| the name Athena, a 12inc together with DJ Tsuyoshi (Prana) on Matsuri.  |::
::| Things then began to happen. In Sweden, my music was played on trance   |::
::| parties, and on national radio I featured in an artist special where me |::
::| and Tzuyoshis track Future Space Travellers was presented as the 12inc  |::
::| Of The Week.With only half a dozen tracks, the English label Koyote     |::
::| offered me a deal. That resulted in Phenomena, released in the end of   |::
::| 1996.                                                                   |::

::| My name was soon quite well known in the trance circuit, with gigs all  |::
::| over the world like Taiwan, Japan, Balkan , Israel, England, Greece,    |::
::| France, Germany and more. When 1997 turned into 1998, I transferred to  |::
::| the larger and french label Distance Records and the album Real Rush,   |::
::| was released in February 1998. Later that year I struck a deal in my    |::
::| home country on swedish label Why Not through Goldhead Music and        |::
::| released my third album Northern Lights.                                |::
