First torrent did not work so I have had to upload again! Sorry!
Extremely rare 1992 release of Daevid Allen's 1967/1969 recordings. The 19 tracks were recorded in various French studios and locations over a period of time that starts right after Allen left the Soft Machine in the Fall of 1967 and ends in early 1969 with the first incarnation of Gong. All had remained in the vaults until 1992 when a French company, now sadly defunct, managed to talk Allen into releasing them. This is raw psych, sometimes reminiscent of Syd Barrett's 1968 solo recordings, that is to say songs with a weird edge.
A lot of them saw the light of day in one form or another on Allen’s subsequent solo albums.
