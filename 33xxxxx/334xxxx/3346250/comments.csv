,d3ciph3r,2005-08-07T15:02Z,"Nice work DJMcTom, but why is it a private torrent using a public tracker?

peer info exchange and public DHT network are disabled for some reason?"
,chronjohnson,2005-08-12T18:08Z,"Yeah I agree...what's the point of making a torrent that me and my man d3ciph3r here can't download.  And such a good one too, that you obviously put a lot of work into."
