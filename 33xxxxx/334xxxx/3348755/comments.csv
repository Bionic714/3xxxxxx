,blemishednicely,2007-11-17T12:58Z,"I can't get this to work, when I take it out of BitTorrent, it goes into rar (my comp. has WinRar) but I have a total bastard of a time with rar shit...just don't seem to get it."
,blemishednicely,2007-11-17T12:58Z,"in other words, what do you do to unpack this correctly?"

,blemishednicely,2007-11-17T13:27Z,"Sorry, sent one X2, my bad...I really hate rar, as it seems to confuse me easily, but I seem to have FINALLY managed to get something to run with winrar---'bout fucking time!! BTW I've only played a bit so far but I LOVED the old Wolfenstein since I first played it on a Jaguar--looks good, like seeing an old friend. And then shooting him in the face. Achtung, Baby!!!"
,eXg.SunTzu,2009-01-15T12:57Z,"How do i get this to work?

TIA"
,Hayzi,2010-01-20T05:13Z,"@ eXg.SunTzu
download dos-box
its a dos emulator and makes the games run perfectly
unpack the game, and put it in C:
find the filename of the installer

start up dos-box and enter this:
>MOUNT C C:/
>C:
>CD ""FOLDER"" (this opens the game's folder)
>""FILENAME""

so when i run wolfenstein 3d, i type:
>MOUNT C C:/
>C:
>CD WOLF3D
>WOLF3D

hope this helps!!!!"
,ElitesamuraI26,2010-05-03T16:07Z,Where is Spear of Destiny?
,ElitesamuraI26,2010-05-03T16:14Z,I'm not gonna download this again because Spear of Destiny is missing.
,gtam21,2010-09-18T15:14Z,"@hayzi might be stupid but where can i find the dos-box u say?
i have already installed the game but cannot play"
,summonedtitan,2010-10-20T07:11Z,"Bout to hit this up and scan it wit the Norton... not to worried about the spear of destiny, just worried about the first Wolfenstein.

Will post later."
,summonedtitan,2010-10-20T07:45Z,"This is fuckin' bullshit....

C:\WOLFSRC\WOLF3D.EXE
The NTVDM CPU has encountered an illegal instruction.
CS:0100 IP:0346 OP:fe 50 06 df 02 Choose 'Close' to terminate the application.

BULLSHIT, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.  
Scanned with NORTON amillion times, no viruses popped but this program just does not work."
,peeebody,2012-05-18T03:17Z,"works great, extract the rar file, get a virtual drive such as virtual clone drive, mount the iso image in your virtual drive

explore the 'cd' and look for the setup up application, install it into an easily typed location on your hard drive, I put mine in c:wolfenstein3d (note the original file name is wolfenstein 3d, but i couldn't get my dosbox to mount it with the space)

get your dosbox program running and enjoy.

for help with using dosbox just check their site.

Thank you Nemesis6434"
