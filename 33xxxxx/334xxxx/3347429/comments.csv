,codmixer,2008-03-03T07:32Z,"Guys, its no use using this torrent, use this one instead: http://www.btmon.com/Games/Unsorted/Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms_X_US_NTSC_DVD.torrent.html

Its the same files, and after some frustrating attempts, I managed to unzip it all with winrar, and the game works fine on my PS2 emulator (allthough a bit laggy due to the graphicdemands for a PS2, that my PC doesnt have)."
,codmixer,2008-03-03T07:35Z,"If noone else seems to be seeding the torrent I linked to, I will seed it during Swedish nighttime (Timezone GMT+1)."
,ventper,2008-03-07T00:10Z,thx cdmixer
,codmixer,2008-03-20T01:45Z,"There, since the files in the torrent I linked to are the same as this one, I replaced the files in this torrent with those, resulting in my copy of THIS torrent becoming 100%.

Now leech/seed and be merry."
,codmixer,2008-03-20T01:55Z,"Alright, I will most likely keep this torrent on my PC for a looong time, so if the torrent dies, contact me on TPB's forum, im PappMacka.

Cheerio!"
,desertranger,2008-04-30T10:19Z,"Mr. codmixer, have you or anyone else successfully unrared this file? I have the whole download but when attempting extraction I get the error 
""You need to have the following volume for extraction"" C:\Documents and Settings\blablabla\Romance of the Three Kingdoms X [US-NTSC-DVD]\ptc-r3kx.r00

Is the rar incomplete? Any help on this would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!"
,AECoteaz,2008-05-14T10:18Z,"This game fully works, the .rar works and the .iso works. I'll be seeding this file when i can and when I can connect to people.

If you need me to seed it send me an email at Angel@yaay.us"
,codmixer,2008-05-25T15:28Z,"@desertranger
It works, just rename the files like ptc-r3kx.001 to ""ptc-r3kx.001.r00"" and ptc-r3kx.002 to ""ptc-r3kx.002.r01"" etc etc. If the message pops up, just choose a file manually.
Hopefully that made some sense, I dont remember exactly how I did it. ;)
If you are unsure, copy all of the files and play around untill it works."
,Sephirothmaestro,2008-08-22T02:29Z,Thank you for seeding this game is amazing thanks a lot you re the king!
,King_dingaling08,2008-09-28T21:59Z,"Can someone seen please?

,hoodaya,2008-11-03T21:44Z,"hey guys could anyone tell me what program they used to extract the files? also could I use this program on a PS2 emulator? I used to have this game on my PS2 and its such a good game, help would be appreciated."
,vetsoljer,2008-11-21T04:38Z,can someone please seed this torrent for awhile... thanks in advance

Just be patient.
Happy gaming! =)"
