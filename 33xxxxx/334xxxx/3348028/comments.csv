,sldsnake,2005-06-24T04:57Z,hmm...50/50 chance of it being a virus?
,ourskool,2005-06-24T06:07Z,Nope... Includes stuff like PortableFirefox and PSPad.  Go to http://www.portablefreeware.com/ for more info
,sldsnake,2005-06-24T16:44Z,"Yep, no virus.  Sorry, just didn't know what you were talking about."
[T],c4ll7,2006-08-04T06:44Z,oh those are harmless virii get over it '_
,eastindiaco,2012-07-08T22:35Z,"yeah! absolutely harmless virii - neutered!! ;P

what begs the question is, that if I could indeed visit http://portablefreeware.com for more info, why shouldn't I download directly from right there?

Unless ""ourskool"" has spiked this torrent with his own special 'spices'? hunh?"
