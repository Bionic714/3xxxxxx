While Rhino's fifth volume in their Have A Nice Day series continues with their representing the Seventies as a decade of MOR pop, the songs on this release (with the exception of Lobo's "Me and You and a Dog Named Boo") fall into two distinct camps: 1) Sixties acts near the end of their chart career, and 2) one-hit wonders.

Let's consider the former first. The Raiders hadn't had a Top 40 hit in two years and hadn't been in the Top 10 for four years when they scored the only No. 1 single of their career with "Indian Reservation." [Trivia alert: Does anyone remember Don Fardon's original version of this song from three years earlier when it peaked at No. 20?] Tommy James had more than a dozen hits in the Sixties, but as a solo "Draggin' the Line" was his only Top 10 chart entry. And talk about coming back from the dead! The Fortunes previous hits ("You've Got Your Troubles" and "Here It Comes Again") were from 1965 before making their final chart appearance with the classic "Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again." Even Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds got their start in the Sixties as part of the studio group The T-Bones of "No Matter What Shape" fame.

Now, as far as the one-hit wonders go, it's a double-edged sword. On the one hand these are infrequently anthologized songs, but some of them were only minor hits. "Games" only reached No. 27 and "Burning Bridges," which came from the film "Kelly's Heroes" fared even worse at No. 37. "Chase" did little better at No. 24, but most people will recognize this because every pep band in the country had this in their repertoire. And does anyone really identify "Here Comes the Sun" (No. 16) with Richie Havens? In fact, the only Top 10 one-hit wonder was Daddy Dewdrop's "Chick-A-Boom (Don't Ya Jes' Love It)."
