THE 4400 Theme Song 

Amanda Abizaid - A Place in Time 
Lyric:
So long ago, another life, 
I can feel your heartbeat. 

It's not a dream, remember us. 
I can see it in your eyes. 

We'll find our place in time, 
A place in time beyond the sun. 

We'll find our place in time, 
A place in time to call our own
