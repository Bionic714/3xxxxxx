,madfocker,2009-08-19T13:23Z,"tried and tested every video convertor online and very few could convert real media to avi/mpeg etc, the few that could were very poor quality, found a free coder and never had a problem since, it's open source, it works brilliant, I am not trying to get people to download a crap endorsment, just try it, promise you wont be dissapointed,
