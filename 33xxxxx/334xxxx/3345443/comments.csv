Since DVDs are designed to play in specific geographical areas, the encoding likely was meant for the European market that excludes not only the US and Canada but occasionally Britain. The other possibilities: 1) a codec that functions under Mac System 9, Quick Time 3, or 4;  2) a vob that is unrecognizable by your player.  I would first try opening the movie with VLC.  If it plays, you can copy it to a different format so that runs on your preferred player."
