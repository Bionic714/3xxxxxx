,takeru,2005-06-25T10:04Z,"hope this works after ""temple of pandora"" and does not hang after several hours of play...
cool game btw, only hope to reach its end"
,alving,2005-06-26T00:37Z,"I already have the proper confusion release, so i'll wait with this one. Please tell if it works or not! 

(I can't test the confusion release just yet, because i'm waiting for my order of a memory card to arrive)"
,alving,2005-06-26T02:11Z,"So this is the GeNiuS-release. Apparently it freezes on level 4, unless this is a second release. I haven't tested it personally, but in Confusions nfo it says the genius rip crashes.

,Norvegia,2005-06-26T12:07Z,"@alving

This is the PAL version, not the NTSC one; GeNiuS released the NTSC version back in march and that was the faulty one, not this one; ConFuSiON hasn't said anything about the PAL release."
,alving,2005-06-26T14:10Z,"Oh, my bad! :P"
,takeru,2005-06-26T22:37Z,anyone tried this after 'temple of pandora' yet?
,Norvegia,2005-06-27T00:55Z,"@takeru

Nobody has completed it yet, so ..."
,pedrin,2005-06-27T09:08Z,Comprobado el juego funciona en el Templo de Pandora.ok.ok.ok.ok
,Norvegia,2005-06-27T10:20Z,"""Comprobado el juego funciona en el Templo de Pandora.ok.ok.ok.ok""

The game supposedly works after Pandora's Temple.

Let's see if I can use my savegame from the NTSC version ;)"
,Norvegia,2005-06-27T11:41Z,"Oh no! The savegames from the NTSC version don't work with the PAL one :'( So I have to start it over again ...

Well, at least it's a great game and  I guess I'll do faster now that I'm experienced."
,Agentorange2,2005-06-27T12:00Z,!UGH! It hangs after you´ve got the second necklace and are on you´re way back.... anyone have any solutions for this problem?
,spsl,2005-06-27T14:32Z,"MULTI 5 ???
WHERE IS THE LANGUAGE SELECTOR ?
I ONLY GET ENGLISH !"
,takeru,2005-06-27T16:14Z,argentorange2: which is the name of the chapter the game hangs on?
,Norvegia,2005-06-27T18:43Z,"Well, I did faster and, right now, I'm on the Bridge of Pandora's Temple and I've been able to save the game (what I couldn't do with the Confusion release) so, for now, everything is fine.

@Agentorange2
Are you talking about this PAL release and not the NTSC one? If not, we're fucked :(

@spsl
Did you configure the settings of the PS2 where you can tell the preferred language? You might have it set to English and that's why it runs in English."
,henzaz,2005-06-27T20:42Z,"Hallå alla.
Finns det nån som kan ge en beskrivning på hur jag bränner ps2 spel. Jag använder Nero och dvd Decrypter.
Jag får det inte att funka.
Tack Henke"
,spsl,2005-06-27T20:44Z,"Norvegia, you're right. My ps2 configuration was set to English. Thanks !!
But now, for the worst part !
 In 3 different site forums , same comments:
   This version hangs after the 2nd necklace and in other location hangs again. if we wait a couple of minutes, it will continue the game. some guys finished all the game, with those 2 ""minor"" problems."
,Norvegia,2005-06-27T21:09Z,"@spsl 
But are you sure they're talking about the PAL version?? Cause Genius already released an NTSC version back in march and that was confirmed faulty."
,spsl,2005-06-27T22:32Z,"Norvegia
Yes, im sure. This was posted in Torrentleech, from where i got this pal version. But, as allways, i will test this myself."
,Agentorange2,2005-06-28T10:40Z,"I can gladly say that i completed the game this morning. I think my laser is quite bad thats why my game hanged  at a point, the music also lagged some times. But again, this copy works! EXCELLENT GAME!!!"
,Norvegia,2005-06-28T12:45Z,"@Agentorange2 
Wow! That's what I call fast! I'm happy to hear that you were able to finish it :)"
,Agentorange2,2005-06-28T18:05Z,"After I got the 2:nd necklace the music started to lag and when i entered the cave (nearby where you got the necklace) the game hangs when it´s loading. I got past this by pressing start when i entered the cave (just before it started to load) when the menu appears the music should work. Let the music play for a while and then try going past the ""loading place"". The game doesn´t normally load at this point but when the music is lagging it hasn´t done so on your way there. Hope this helps everybody that has this problem, i tried for about 2 hours to get past this place. But it was worth it!! Remember to save when you get to the next save point.

Once again, EXCELLENT game!"
,alving,2005-06-28T23:53Z,"Wow! Good work testing the game Agentorange2!
I'm playing the Confusion NTSC-release just now, and i'm wondering if it is going to hang at any point in the game. Because if so, I would rather begin again with this PAL-release than to be forced to do it later."
,takeru,2005-06-29T00:09Z,finally got the fulldvd9 version of this great game. gonna toxic-patch it then burn on a DL DVD to see if it works...
,Norvegia,2005-06-29T22:34Z,"I've gotten the Panodra's Box and I've had not problems, not hangs at all yet. So far so good."
,Norvegia,2005-06-30T23:46Z,"@Relaq 
As I said, my copy didn't hang on Pandora's Temple; I was expecting it to hang, but it went smooth. It could be the media you used or that you burnt it faster than recommended."
,Agentorange2,2005-07-01T08:16Z,Allways burn at slowest possible speed (Why in a hurry???) and some poeple suggest you use only dvd-r media. Bulq dvd´s are not recommended. 
,Norvegia,2005-07-01T14:53Z,"Just finished the game (yay!) with no lock-ups at all. In case anyone is interested, I burnt the game to a Verbatim +R at 2.4x.

By the way, AWESOME game (now I'm trying to complete the 10 challenges)."
,Saibaman,2005-07-01T17:13Z,Do i have to chip my Ps2 to play this?
,Norvegia,2005-07-01T17:48Z,"@Saibaman
Either that or use the ""Swap Magic"" method."
,sadgOd,2005-07-02T00:40Z,"Well I burned it on a Platinum Dvd+ at 8x with ""Alcohol120%"" Burned the ISO direct on disc and it works just fine! Great game!!!"
,Agentorange2,2005-07-02T18:46Z,Anyone completed the 10 challenges? I´m stuck on 8/10. Any suggestions how to finish that one?
,black_soul,2005-07-02T20:47Z,"The game don't work on my ps2, i burned it 3 times but it always freeze on the very first screen, is there something special to do to burn it or dusn't it work with the swap magic ?"

,Fr0stR0se,2008-11-13T12:43Z,"My game messed up at the Cliffs of Madness, where you have to backtrack. There's an FMV that shows you you're supposed to go to an earlier area where a rock with a rope falls down.
I backtracked and the rock with the rope from the FMV was nowhere to be found.
I then tried again.
I then read a walkthrough which told me to backtrack and climb the rope.

Oh and the Treasures section in the menu is messed up. But i think the videos were ripped."
