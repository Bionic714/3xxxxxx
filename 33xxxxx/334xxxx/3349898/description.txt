To Floyd fans in the know, this top-heavy concept album was actually old hat, as the band had addressed its themes about the horrors of war, the cruelty of society, the machinations of the music industry and the self-constructed wall of insanity in its earlier work. Hired session musicians abound, intruding on that old band chemistry, but several songs actually hold up divorced from the big production and master concept, including "Mother," "Comfortably Numb" (with Gilmour's last great guitar solo) and the hard-rocking "Run Like Hell."
