,vonhofsten,2006-07-30T08:23Z,"Seed please! I`m at 98,7% and I would really like to have the remaining 1,3%"
,codecoptor,2006-12-28T06:07Z,"This release, like the FEFE2003 one, is full of clicks. I have some individual mp3s (downloaded from a myspace-type of site) and they sound better at 128kbps"
,codecoptor,2006-12-28T06:18Z,"Oh dear bob saap, you are a bit of a lamer. You've taken the FEFE2003 release (as evidenced by the ID3v2 tags in the first 21 songs) and you've added the two bonus tracks and covers from elsewhere. (Uhum) OLD DUPE. USELESS DUPE."
,codecoptor,2006-12-28T15:45Z,"Turns out that Bob Saap is even lamer that we thought. This torrent is a re-release of the LimiteMusic one, which is a re-release of the FEFE2003 one which is bad quality..."
