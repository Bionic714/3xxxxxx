,orgpunk,2005-06-29T20:33Z,And why is Cuba a 3rd world country?
,TrickyNick,2005-06-30T05:52Z,"The film was directed by Cubans, not Americans, and was presented by the Cuban Human Rights Film Project.  A thorough review of the film can be found that self-admittedly liberal New York Times:

this does not mean anything...did not see this but if the cubans that did the movie were the bacardi-cubans, this means something completely different!

but anyway, can anyone explain why the guantanamo torture-camp is possible at all? would george drop a bomb on cuba if they would not allow it?"

,warpengi,2005-07-01T03:41Z,"A recently released Canadian has given some pretty good accounts of the torture that is going on there.  Not to mention the reports from the red cross and amnesty international.  If there is no torture going on there why has the red cross been banned form monitoring conditions as they have a right to by international treaty?  If there is no torture going on there why are they not provided rights under the laws of the u.s. or under international law as prisoners of war under the Geneva convention?
TrickyNick maybe you oughtta read some media besides your self-censored, ass kissing corporate media in the u.s.  There is a lot more going on in your own country that you don't even know because your media won't report it.  Propaganda is something the u.s. excells at.  Almost as good at that as invading sovereign nations under totally illegal pretences.  The chicken hawks ought to be tried in Nuremberg."
,TrickyNick,2005-07-01T05:38Z,"Amnesty International is a joke organization -- has been for a long time.  To compare Gitmo with a Soviet gulag or concentration camp is laughable.  Similarly, you take the word of a prisoner who obviously has an interest in disparaging the US and his captors over the word of a bipartisan congressional committee.   That is your right but it's hard to take you seriously in that case.  If you can't distinguish between the Third Reich and the US then you certainly are one of the ""useful idiots"" -- Lenin's favorite term, as the case may be.

What country are you from?"
,warpengi,2005-07-01T20:53Z,"The rest of the world is very aware that u.s'ers like to remain willfully ignorant.  That surprises no one.  Thanks for demonstrating that once again.  Come back whan you are ready to rejoin the world community.

,Chromic,2005-07-03T21:53Z,"TrickyNick...I really feel sorry for you. Haven´t you understood yet that the only thing the U.S is interested in is to maintain capitalism by oppressing the workingclass in the meantime that  they gain more economic and political power... Did you really think that Mr Pinochet could take over Chile by himself? He did with the help of your fascist leaders that were interested in the economic profits they could gain from our country. And have you forgot about the support of the U.S in the genocide in present Turkey, the terrorist regime in Suhartos in Indonesia, the support of the Contras terrorists in Nicaragua, Unita in Angola, The Apartheid regim in South Africa. The USA has invaded Panama and Somalia. USA-bomber has  fallen over Irak, Yugoslavia, Sudan and Afghanistan, not to mention Vietnam Korea and Hiroshima. And you ignorant people..slaves of George Walker Bush, AKA ""The anticrist"" (ASCII=666), still belives that it is to make the world a safer place to live in. Why do they let country´s like Israel, Pakistan and India have weapons of mass destruction in their power while Saddam cannot. Do you really think his a more dangerous lunatic than the governors of these country´s including yours? It´s because Saddam didn´t agree on letting the U.S dictate for them how to act in foreign politics. And remember that the fall of mankind won´t be beacuse of a dangerous man like Saddam for example, but beacuse the ""quickening"" society that you so much embrase and which will have more catastrofic consequences that your little brain haven´t figured out yet,why? Because people of your government like you to take that particulary roll of being the stupid and fooled ones. Onfortunately there are so many more around the world that have been tricked ,just like you TrickyNick, to believe that the American way would be a good way for the rest of the world as well... If you ignorant people would be able to fly then we wouldn´t be able to see the beautiful rays of light we recieve from the sun!!!"
,TrickyNick,2005-07-03T22:58Z,"What country do you come form Chromic that you can be so brainwashed?  Stopping genocide in Yugoslavia wasn't right? Stopping mass graves in Iraq is bad?  Stopping the Taliban from hanging gays and women is bad? Defeating Hitler -- Bad?  

Israel is allowed to have the bomb because it's a democratic nation that doesn't gas it's own people.  Same reason France and England are allowed to have the bomb.  If you don't like the fact that Pakistan has the bomb you are welcome to disarm them.  

If you hate a ""quickening society"" so much stop using the internet -- invented in the US.  Your router -- invented in the US.  Flight, invented in the US.  Personal computer -- US.  Stop getting vaccinated and die of polio.  Stop downloading DVD's  -- invented in the US.  

Go back to your collective farm and blow your wonderful Sandanistas.  Since you know I come from the US why don't you tell me what country you hail from, douchebag."
,TrickyNick,2005-07-05T22:12Z,"Sorry, warpengi, most Iraqis and Afghans will disagree with you.  Look at the women voting in Afghanistan -- wonderful sight isn't it?  I know they love being able to walk in the street without your beloved Taliban lynching them with, or being gay an not hung in UN-built soccer stadiums.  The election in Iraq also speaks against you, with record voter turnout from all walks of life.  The record turnout for Iraqi police forces -- in the face of heavy suicide-bombings, doesn't bolster your ""arguments"" either.  You should concentrate on the terrorists who target civilians and use civilians as human shields.  "

If this world was a computer game, I'd be pressing 'Restart' about now.  In the next attempt, we should try it all without religion."
,TrickyNick,2005-07-07T09:25Z,"Chromic:  Nothing can excuse the brutal actions of Pinochet.  At the same time, your man Allende wasn't such a sweety.  It's not at all clear if he would have been better had he been given the chance to rule for longer than he did.  I wonder if you would have been equally resentful of the Soviets had Allende used their backing (and Castro's) to cement a dictatorship.  Certainly, the economy was failing mightily under his watch, his loyalists were infiltrating the military, and he did say that actions a-la Che Guevara were legitimate tactics.  As so often has been the case in Central and South America, foreign governments were given the choice to back one of two sides who were, or turned out to be, unpalatable.  To answer your question, yes, I have been in numerous other countries, destitute ones, and that travel has only reinforced my appreciation for the US.  Instead of blaming the US for not donating the lion's share of its economy to support failing economies (although it is the world's largest donor), ask instead why those countries cannot build the democratic political systems and contractual guarantees that ensure growth, trade and investment."
,TrickyNick,2005-07-08T04:53Z,"Allende hardly had popular support according to the election results.  He had a plurality of 36%.  I don't think anyone starts out evil, but power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  As I wrote previously, I wonder if you would be equally resentful of the Soviets, who engaged in realpolitik equally if not more than the US, who had no problem rejecting a nation's sovereignty anywhere they went.  Not just the Baltics, or Eastern Europe, but also in the Americas and Southeast Asia.  If you look at the totality of Communist regimes throught history, the most ""successful"", that is, not presently catastrophic, are China and Cuba.  Why do you think Chile would have fared any better than these two totalitarian regimes, which perhaps by some measure provide for their people, but without basic freedoms?"
,Poderosa,2005-07-13T10:52Z,"TrickyNick, you should read Michael Moores books ""Who stole my country"" and ""Stupid white men"". And as you said in the beginning, power corrupts, and therefore, George Bush! And the only reason you guys went in to Afghanistan was to catch Bin Ladin, and still u havent found him. But there´s a catch, and that´s why i recommend you to read those 2 books... and btw, dont touch the first page.. or you´ll get the department of homeland security after you =p"
,IlyaZ,2005-08-12T18:32Z,"USA supported Pol Pot. Vietnam had to invade Cambodia in order to stop the US supported 
Genocide there. Thank USA for DEFATING HITLER??! They didn't do a shit! It was the Soviet Union that almost alone defeated Nazi Germany. They eliminated 90% of the german troops and lost 22 Million people plus almost all chances USSR had to create a better society. What did USA do? Nothing at all, D-DAY was NOTHING. 

Look at this map:

2 TINY LITTLE US FLAGS HAHA! BUT 90% of all honor and movies. Americans like you, can go to hell.

Totalitarian Communist Regimes? How's that? Do you even know what communism is? I don't think so. No single country has ever been communist. The Union of Soviet Socialist republic was a socialist country which was governed by a communist party. BUT there was no communism in USSR."
,IlyaZ,2005-08-12T18:35Z,"Most Cuban ""dissidents"" are bought by CIA and USA. USA as we all know is a country much like Afghanistan was, that harbours terrorists. Just take a look at the former CIA agent Possada Carilles (sp?) who hijacked/blew an aircraft and many other things on Cuba. He lives in USA, but USA doesn't want to do anything with this Terrorist."

Yes, the thugs running Cuba pay for their power by using a tiny fraction of what they steal to provide some crummy health-care, focusing on propaganda and servicing the Party Elite.  They are proven documented liars in faking statistics to boost their infant mortality and life expectancy rankings.

Socialism is so inherently inferior that it cannot compete with capitalism through free choice.  Capitalism, like science, is based on open inquiry and recognizing the consequences; socialism, like religion that it is, is based on emotions, brainwashing, and corrupt power!  The only voluntary socialism the world has seen is a small dirty hippie commune, and even there most were still living on their capitalist daddies' credit cards!  Socialism cannot exist without tyranny, repression, censorship, even genocide, and relative poverty on a massive scale!  Due to reduced quality of life, Billions of people go to an early grave because of socialism!

Latin America is a great example - rich countries that go Communist become poor and tyrannical, while poor countries that go capitalist (ex. Chile - thank you Pinochet) become rich and free!

People who think Cuba is a good place to live have no business living and voting in the USA.  This is a country founded by capitalists for capitalists.  (The same also applies to other Former British Colonies to some degree, especially Hong Kong and Singapore.)  This is what made it richer and freer than Latin America.  Educate yourselves.

I challenge you to stop being brainwashed commie patsies, to study all sides of the issue, and to think critically and logically.  Read Ludwig von Mises, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Bastiat, Hayek, Ayn Rand, the Friedmans, and other capitalist / libertarian economists and philosophers.

I too was once a left-winger and an ecotard.  Socialism is the default position of a naive and emotional mind, but a rational and open mind cannot remain socialist for long!"
,AlexLibman,2012-07-03T15:01Z,"Too much lies and stupidity in the above comments for me to address all of it, but I'll at least touch upon IlyaZ's distortions...

USA never ""supported"" Pol Pot any more than it ""supported"" Stalin in WW2 - a rational method of ridding the world of socialist tyrants on a budget is to back the lesser evil (which can simply be the side more incompetent and prone to self-destruction).  Which evil is lesser is debatable, of course, but implying that USA was pro-Pot is ridiculous.

Politics is a dirty business, and geopolitics (i.e. war) is even dirtier, but it is a means to an end.  Most people in the world are stupid enough to support communism, and yet communism has failed - in most part thanks to American involvement, without which much of Eurasia would resemble North Korea today.

I was born in the Soviet Union, and I know both communist theory and history (especially economic history) quite well...

Communism as it exists in theory is a logical impossibility.  Marx wasn't an economist dealing with reality, he was a violent zealot with delusions of divine revelation (ex. historical certainty of world revolution).  Communist governments have ruled much of humanity for decades, and spared no expense or human cost in order to fulfill their vision, and yet you say those outcomes don't count.  Pure free market capitalism has never existed either, but you can look at a list of countries ranked by Economic Freedom and see a definite causal relationship between capitalism and prosperity.  Capitalists don't have to make excuses that capitalism isn't pure - the results are self-evident.

The English-Speaking Peoples (Britain, USA, and other former colonies) are the ones who saved the world from nationalist socialism (aka fascism), and, as an even greater achievement, kept internationalist socialism (aka communism) in check while it self-destructed.

Getting millions of brainwashed peasants to catch bullets is not a path to victory!  The Soviets provided the cannon fodder (including my own grandfather, killed on the Eastern Front), but USA provided what was needed to win the war - the funds, the science / engineering / logistics, and the industrial might.  The Soviets couldn't even get enough warm socks for their soldiers, much less sufficient weapons, jeeps, tanks, aircraft, trucks, food supplies, medical supplies, etc, etc, etc.

I don't support USA's foreign policy blindly - you'll find plenty of criticism from me on the way it has conducted itself in the Middle East, and especially the recent mistake with that idiot thug Saakashvili.  But, all things considered, USA has been a heroic nation on the world stage, and a definite force for good."
