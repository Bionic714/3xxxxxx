David Icke at the top of his form as he presents six and a half hours of incredible information before a sell out audience of 1200 at the Vogue Theatre in Vancouver; British Columbia, Canada.

You will laugh, you may even cry, and you will be on the edge of your seat as the fantastic story of true human history and who really controls the world today unfolds in Icke's unique style; aided by video footage and hundreds of illustrations.

This is the presentation the Illuminati, the forces of global control, tried so hard to stop -- media interviews were cancelled -- immigration officials turned up at the theatre to question his right to speak -- pressure was applied on the venue to cancel the event itself -- and pies were even thrown at David Icke at a book signing by a rent-a-mob who ludicrously and outrageously sought to dub him a "racist." But nothing could silence him or break his spirit and here you will see the result. David Icke showing that if you do not concede to fear -- anything is possible. 3-DVD set. 6.5 hours $59.95
