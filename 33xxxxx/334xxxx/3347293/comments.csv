The cures are the same thing they have always been. Eat right and excercise. Simply mindblowing! One last secret to reveal. His book is now on tv for 15 bucks. But he has his newsletter that he wants to send you for six bucks a month. So it turns out that everyone wants a piece of the health care pie. He is in business to make money just like the ones he condemns."
,sk85cky,2006-02-03T05:33Z,"not true, if you acually read teh book you'd understand it has nothing to do with anything youv just stated"
,Pendulum777,2006-04-13T00:00Z,"Kevin Trudeau Kicks Ass !
The man speaks so well, tells it like it is,
is honest, intelligent & insightfull
Everyone should hear this audio cd,
its great
he is right on...
but you should know that already just based on how he is presented in mainstream media, 
When a hundred Fools tell you this man shouldnt be listened to, what does it tell you ??
It tells me he must be talking some raw, well said truth
Peace !"
,N8_GR8,2006-05-05T07:45Z,Okay....So maybe he is a fraud....yep. he is fraud.
,salemmafiainc,2007-05-06T18:51Z,"so what if hes lieing or not lol its nice to look at things like this
and ya he is in business of money makeing just like every one is"
,kalil3003,2007-11-02T00:09Z,"To me, he is a crook. I ordered his 2 natural cures books and paid 20 dollars, but never received anything. I sent so many emails but never one reply. I like his stuff, but just download it and dont order anything..!"

Read the book before you spread your ?mediaotic? opinion. 
Qoute from the book:
?All of the author's royalties on the sale of this book are being used to help fund the mission of educating people about natural health care and exposing corporate and government corruption.?

Your response is well thought out and insightful. Keep up the intelligent debate.

kalil3003,
The author does not distribute the book. His publisher does. If you have not received your ?two? copies of the book, you should write the publisher about your situation."
,Stevesaudio,2008-01-12T20:13Z,"Well actually Kevin Trudeau is the author & the publisher. At least that's what he said on his infomercial I just saw today, 1\12\2008.  "
,iceman45,2009-10-18T09:29Z,Isn't this the guy who was selling that bogus coral calcium product among a few others?
,zaidnoremac,2010-01-25T07:53Z,"Yep, he is a scam artist. Make sure you only download this crap for free. Never pay for it."
