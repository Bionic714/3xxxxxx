,IceMaster,2005-06-30T03:38Z,If Norton says it's infected... it's infected.  And there's no such thing as a harmless computer virus.

,billbo72,2007-02-07T20:11Z,"This is what comes packaged with this particular crown prince of a seeded torrent: 


1.Trojan horse Generic2.JFQ 
2.Trojan horse Downloader.Inservice.M 
3.Trojan horse Downloader.Inservice.M 
4.Trojan horse Downloader.Inservice.O 
5.Trojan horse Dropper.Agent.ZG 
6.Hidden Extention.exe 


What a shrapnel grenade of crap!

I'm using AVG Pro, AVG Anti-Spyware Full, AD-Aware Pro and Spy-Bot S&D. I don't like Norton AV either, but when it detects something, it's not detecting a stray note from the church choir!


Now, there are some good d@#n Windows Keygens and other key tools in this, so if you're brave, you can give it a try. I just wanted to make everyone aware before you spend your time DLing this, possibly damaging your system and then, last but not least, deleting it from file and your seed swarm resulting in a more DL than UL ratio that shows that you're not just a leech. Your choice but it seems like too many negative consequences for me to deal with."
,DudeRisk,2007-09-04T10:50Z,"Yeah right, almost all AntiViruses says that keygens & cracks are always some ""TROJAN-GEN902"" Etc, mostly it's a lie. Trend Micro is good 'cause it tells if it's in the ""Keygen & Crack zone"" or of it's really is a virus & not false like AVG & Avast & others AV Comps."
