,gj_1970,2008-11-23T09:03Z,"IT DOES NOT WORK, THIS UPLOADER IS ASSHOLE"
,kid-fix,2008-12-05T09:20Z,"That's constructive...""THE UPLOADER IS ASSHOLD...' Like your grammar there.....You could be a little more helpful about saying why it doesn't work, or are you just a retard who can't use a computer? 
Please, if someone has downloaded, does this work?
Many thanks. "
