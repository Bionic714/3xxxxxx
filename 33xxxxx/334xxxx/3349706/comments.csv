@all
This keygenerator does not work with 5.1!!!
At first it will be accept the key, but in navigation you will see that the system does not work.
Or after some hours the GPS signal also will lost and the program will kick the serial. And all starts again?..insert key?.accept????.
In version 5.1 will be no keys accept witch end with 1TH21 (whole Wold-Map key).
Such keys, for whole world, does not exist in real.
Sorry my English"
