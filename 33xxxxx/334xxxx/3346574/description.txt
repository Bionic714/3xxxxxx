That description does nothing for you really, you just have to download and check it out. This is the original version of the film before Lucas decided to "update" it with CG scenes and new backgrounds.  A laserdisc rip, the original film was used to transfer over to the laserdisc so it does have a "film" look to it i.e. white spots appearing for a fraction of a second and in one part you can atually see where a hair got caught on the edge of the film.

You will not find this version of the film commercially available so if you own the remastered dvd version you may have fun comparing the differences.
