,Locobot,2005-06-24T11:20Z,"TY for this upload! The remastered version is not as badly ruined as the starwars remakes Lucas did, but still it loses something precious with all that fine polishing.  "
,testor1138,2005-06-26T02:51Z,"GOD BLESS YOU.

Anyone who loved and appreciated the original
version will be disgusted by the gratuitous use
of computer graphics thrown in at random in
the re-release.

Lucas and Speilberg will burn in the hottest circle
of hell for their constant tampering year after 
year.   (The latest bullshit:  Lucas is going to 
go back to Star Wars V: Empire Strikes Back
and REPLACE the puppet yoda with the computer
animation version.)    We need to contribute to
a fund to feed Lucas more fatty foods so he dies
of a heart attack as soon as possible."

http://www.maverick-media.co.uk/movies/thx_1138_1971/changes_001.html

For me, the most egregious offense was the addition of the totally random, unnecessary 'gravity-defying CGI monkeys' at the end of the film. Typical Lucas debasement. Sigh."
,mbkao,2009-09-18T19:19Z,"I love watching movies that never made it to DVD. Yes, a movie that got altered on DVD never ""made it over""."
