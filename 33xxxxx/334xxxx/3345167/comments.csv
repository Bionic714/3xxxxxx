,KOREA Nuclear,2005-06-16T09:07Z,"Thx, i know this album for years. I think it was released in 1998 and since then it has
become a classic. Downtempo at its most elegant and cossy state. Im now going after their Dj Kicks session you posted here, although being a supporter of Kruder & Dorfmeister for years, never had the opportunity to listen to it really. I also strongly recommend their previous work: G-Stoned E.P., which are four of K&D own themes (K&D Sessions standard). I've got them in mp3 independently (long ago there was the Audiogalaxy golden age...), I can post them in TPB too if you ask so. Greetings."
,rzor,2005-06-16T12:25Z,great job j-dog! Been looking for this one for a while! thanx for sharing.
,KOREA Nuclear,2005-06-16T17:56Z,"I didn't know about a bronze and a silver version. The set in the standard K&D Sessions is pretty tight arranged, so it has to do with bonus tracks or a book i presume."
,Rootsman,2005-06-18T19:38Z,This is a defect album. Track 21 (Strange Cargo / Million Town) is missing. Great album otherwise...
,pediddle,2005-08-10T08:41Z,This is one CD I actually own!  But I'm going to download it anyway :)

,r5piQrva,2006-09-12T17:35Z,"If track 21 is missing, can someone plese upload it??  Please?   :->"
,Wububu,2008-03-20T05:32Z,Is anyone else having trouble with the files? I try and load them into itunes and it just doesnt work. Mind you I can still play them in winamp.
,Wububu,2008-03-23T22:30Z,I think ive discovered the problem. The ID Tags are messed up. Can anyone confirm?
,mbonaci,2009-04-03T23:42Z,"If you like K&D check out their labels K7 and G-Stone recordings.
I've heard that they two don't get along very good lately, so they both started remixing separately:

Richard Dorfmeister & Peter Huber: 
   Tosca:
