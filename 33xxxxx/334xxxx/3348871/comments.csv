,polyvinyl,2005-06-29T06:45Z,"It works for me, i dunno what problems you are having."
,wizzie123,2005-06-29T08:23Z,"If it doesn't work you've probably installed the demo version earlier. I found this on a forum some time ago on how to get it to work again.

1) Uninstall the demo or the retail versions of fraps. 
2) Close any application that YOU (not necessarily your computer) might be running. 
3) Open Regedit. 
4) Press Ctrl+F to bring up the searching tool and ask it to search for ""nZgFQGQhfU"" exclude the quotation marks. The reason why we need to perform a search trough the whole registry is because this value gets installed into different paths depending on the computer it is running on. But I’m pretty sure it’s name remains always the same. 
5) When it finds that value, delete it. DO NOT delete the Key/Folder that contains this value. 
6) Now delete ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWARELicenses"". 
7) Close Regedit.
8) Open the DOS command prompt. And type ""c:"" and then ""cd %temp%"" and finally ""del /s /q *.tmp""
9) Exit the DOS prompt once it has finished doing the instruction described above. 
10) Install the retail version of fraps (make sure you are not installing the demo). 

This method worked for me, hope it solves your problems."

I've found a program to remove all trial-registry entries

inside you choose for ""armadillo"" (2nd on the icon list) 

should work after you load it
