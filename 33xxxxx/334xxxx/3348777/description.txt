Tunes on the go P

*Its a radio too Using third party software such as iPodder (a free download) together with PSPWare, you can listen to live-recorded audio streams on your PSP while you're on your way to school, work, or anywhere! 

*Widescreen, baby! Take a movie, add it to PSPWare's movies section and PSPWare will automatically convert and optimize it for your PSP's screen. You can swap movies with a single click, making it super practical! PSPWare supports every common movie format* (MOV, MPG, AVI, WMV, VOB) and you can easily prepare your DVD library for watching on your PSP's gorgeous 16:9 wide aspect ratio screen! 

*Hotswap those sticks! PSPWare 2.0 introduces Sync Profiles. Sync Profiles allow you to sync different content onto each of your Memory Sticks. That means you can have a movie stick (or three), a photo stick... well, you get the picture - easy as pie! 

*Integration friendly You can integrate PSPWare 2.0 with existing or newly created applications through the new Dropboxes feature. Simply drop PSP-ready files into PSPWare's Dropboxes and sync the newly added content to the PSP. Both hobbyists and developers alike can leverage Dropboxes to automate content export to the PSP. You can also use Dropboxes as a means to quickly add images, music or movies downloaded from the web or from Sony's PSP Connect site.
