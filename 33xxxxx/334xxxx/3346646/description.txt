* there is a drop on the original tape at a certain point of the song.
+ last minute of the song sound get a little weird.
@ beginning of the song is missing

Please do not expect a great sound quality from this, is it
just a discreet audience recording that i cleaned a little bit,
but on the other side expect a marvelous performance, reaching
his peak on the 14 minutes of "the war goes on", a psychedelic
orgy with eastern vibes. From my point of view i consider the
Mad River one of the top bands of the californian psychedelic era,
and their 2 lp's are, absolutely, 2 masterpieces, as the solo lp's
from their leader Lawrence Hammond. Since i never found anything
else beside this tape in years of searching, and i still hope this tape
and others will surface one day in better quality, i would like to
share this gem i have, even if the sound quality is it just ok, but
like i said, the performance is an unique document that testify the
greatness of this super underrated band. If you can deal with a
minor sound quality compare to the standard, my advice is jump on it.
