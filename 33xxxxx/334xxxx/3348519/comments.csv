Can someone please help me.  I'm trying to download this video, but everytime I try to save it, it says that the file is a .torrent document.  Am I doing something wrong?
Thanks"

,hammerzeit,2008-06-10T18:05Z,I need a seed please!  I'm seeding at the moment but my file is only 86.9% complete. :c
,hammerzeit,2008-06-11T04:53Z,"Thank you, seeder! Can I get one more? The torrent doesn't seem to want to move unless I have two or more seeders, and I had two the other night. 

Thank you again!"
