,EnergizerRabbit,2005-06-21T05:44Z,"FYI: There is a similiar torrent here: 
http://www.animeyume.org/details_torrent.php?id=5061

However, nearly half of the files in that torrent are from Anime-Keep.  Nothing against A-Keep, but I prefer to have all of my anime from the same group if possible."
,EnergizerRabbit,2005-06-21T19:01Z,"I only monitor my server at night, so if it's down just be patient.  It won't be down for more than a half day.

Thanks for downloading!!!"
,th3_fr4gil3,2005-06-28T21:30Z,"p.s
excellent series,one of my top faves."
,th3_fr4gil3,2005-06-28T21:33Z,"s-ai never got around to subbing eps 12-13.
HISTORY:
series was licenced midrun so most subbers dropped series,s-ai picked up from that point till finish, and also started to sub previous eps from ep1 onwards."
,Rozefire,2005-07-03T11:25Z,None of my players will let me play it... :(...
,Rozefire,2005-07-03T11:27Z,I'm new to BitTorrent so I'm not sure if this is normal.  Are the files suppose to download this fast?  When I used other downloading programs... it took me about a few days or so.
