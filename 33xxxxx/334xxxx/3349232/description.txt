An incredible Italian drama-comedy movie made in 1997. Beautiful soundtrack, great actors, great dialogues, and deep deep meanings. Please seed with me and share as much as you can.

This movie is the most beautiful movie I ever seen since 1984; the day of my birth. It's called Life Is Beautiful, and life could be much more beautiful if you watched this movie.
