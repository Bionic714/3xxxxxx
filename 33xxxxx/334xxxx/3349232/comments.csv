Other than that, it is a good rip, and of course a very enjoyable movie. Thanks!

If you can upload the original italian version, please please do it! There are a few of us who actually understand italian (and a lot of us who don't like dubbed movies) who would appreciate it. "
,prabato,2005-06-29T10:57Z,":) You might be surprised. I don't know Italian, but I was trying to find the original Italian movie, but I couldn't. I was also trying to find a better quality on the Internet, but I failed. Only this version exists on the Internet and another one which I think is similar.

I have not rippted this movie, I just downloaded it from Limewire, but it's just that it wasn't available as torrents, so I created a torrent for it and distributed it among many torrent servers.

Try your luck on Limewire, download the other version of La vita e' Bella, which is 6-- mb+ and not 705 mb, perhaps this is the oiriginal Italian. And let me know if you did it.

Thanks for your comment."

This is an italian film, and somehow, it would not fit, to use voices with harlem or oxford accent there. And it was rather well done voice dubbing, so it did not spoil the picture. I have been looking for this film for a time being, and finally I found it here. If you know where to find a dvd version I would be grateful. Also if someone knows where to find Zorba the Greek would be nice. Carry on guys."
,prabato,2005-07-27T19:00Z,"Well, I finished downloading the 2CD Xvid version of this movie in its original Italian voice, with English subtitles. 

At the same time, I am still downloading the same version of this movie in 2 CDs DivX quality English-voice over.

I haven't decided which one I should upload here, because the English voice-over is done pretty good, despite the very tiny loss of meanings in words (I realized after watching the Italian one).

Maybe I will uplaod the original Italian version soon, though, I am waiting to empty some space in my HD.

I like this movie so much that I am even trying to fully create an arabic subtitle for it with manual translation."
