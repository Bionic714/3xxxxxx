I have read this works perfectly as long as your firmware is 1.5  It is not working, as far as I know, on 1.51.  Have not had a chance to test it myself yet.
You can dl it directly from one of these mirrors:

take all folders from the psp/games/ directory on your psp MS1. and put a % after each name. for example, the folder is tetris, it will become tetris%

its that simple. and put those on to your MS2 which has all the roms and stuff. god i wish we know that, could have saved alot of people alot of time. its just a %, a fukn % after the folder."
