Michael Shermers bok - Why People Believe Weird Things

Det är självaste Herr Shermer som läser (engelska).

Description: Why do so many people become believers in superstitions, extraordinary nonsensical claims, recovered memory, alien abductions, etc. Why in this age of supposed scientific enlightenment do we seem to be more dangerously confused than ever? With a no-holds-barred assault on popular "weird things," Michael Shermer debunks these claims and explores the very human reasons some we find them so appealing.
