    INFORMATION:

    This package is my little "contribution" to the scene.

    Hope you like it ... !! Comments & Suggestions are very welcome !!

    Releases will be made available on a weekly basis, unless a serious bug
    is found, or something else happens that justifies an Update.

    I only included the Original Project Mayhem III skin from the CVS to
    keep the Release Size small and to make sure everything works perfectly.
    If you wanna use other skins make sure they are at least Version 1.3 !

    Scripts included:
    FlexiBrowser / GameSaves / GameSpotPlus / GameTrailers / iFilmBrowser
    StupidVideos / QuickTimeBrowser (Movie Trailers) / simpleKML V2 (WebRadio) 

    I modified the SkinProject Mayhem IIIPALDialogSubMenu.xml so that all
    of the Scripts appear in the Scripts Submenu. If you don´t like this, or
    some of the Scripts, you should edit this file to your personal preferences.
    The original file from CVS is also still present as DialogSubMenu.xml.ORG.

    Visualisation addons included (all zipped):
    G-Force:  1507 total (including the 490 CVS supplied ones)
    Milkdrop: 5654 total (including the 436 CVS supplied ones)
              I added numbers [XXXX] in front of the Presets names.

    Just in case, the Original CVS Presets are backed up to the folders
    visualisationsG-ForceOriginal Files from CVS
    visualisationsMilkdropOriginal Files from CVS

    RELEASE NOTES:

    Integrated the new MilkDrop Preset Pack that Kevin Sartori just released.
    Thanks for making these available Kevin !
    Capitalized the Presets names and added numbers in the format [XXXX] -
    I like them better that way ...

    CHANGELOG:

    To keep this .nfo shorter, I only provide you with the last 3 lines here,
    so you can see what´s included. You can view the official XBMC Changelog at  
    http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/xbmc/XBMC/Changelog.txt?view=markup
    You can also find it in docsChangelog.txt

    Some TIPS:

    If you are experiencing all kinda weird problems using an updated version
    of XBMC it is always a good idea to delete the XBMC´s SaveGame
    using the Micro$oft Dashboard. Alternatively you can just delete the
    E:TDATA face008 and E:UDATA face008 directories.
    This is especially important if you are updating from quite an old version.

    To avoid problems you should also check - with every new release - 
    if the included XboxMediaCenter.xml has been changed significantly.
    You should then update your own customized XboxMediaCenter.xml accordingly.
