,Slimit,2005-06-27T15:47Z,Thanks again for a fantastic release of the best mediacenter there is :)

Do you want more skins in the next release (hifi, the orbs ...) ?
I did not include more than PMIII so that releases are smaller and downloading and ""installing"" a skin for XBMC from e.g. allxboxskins is just too easy ;-)

So is it : SKINS or NOSKINS ???

,Izzy,2005-06-28T00:27Z,"I think I would like to have more skins.
I have a 160 GB hdd so for me it's no problem. :D"
,jasin,2005-06-28T01:44Z,Very nice stuff here. I would like to see future release include more skins aswell... I've got 160gb hdd also so it really doesn't mater if the skins take up a bit of that room:)
,Arnax,2005-06-28T03:31Z,"Thx for the new build GasGiver! And please keep your builds small and efficient, everyone should be able to get the skins they want by themselves, there's no point in adding anything on top of the only officially supported skin in your releases imho."
,Izzy,2005-06-28T15:10Z,"Can't you Release TWO then. :D
One with skins and the other one without? =)
Would be really nice.
Because I'm to lazy to go download every skin myself. :P"
,The Raf Man,2005-06-29T07:46Z,"Has anyone experienced the same white visualization getting stuck in MilkDrop never changing at all? Anybody knows how to fix this?

Thanks for a great build!"

To avoid problems you should also check - with every new release - if the included XboxMediaCenter.xml has been changed significantly.
You should then update your own customized XboxMediaCenter.xml accordingly.


Something in xboxmediacenter.xml was changed regarding to the rss feeds.
take a look at the original and change yours accordingly"
