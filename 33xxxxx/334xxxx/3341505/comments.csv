,Chewwie,2005-08-01T14:35Z,whats the news on the missing eps?
,TrulisRohk,2005-08-01T21:24Z,"if i did, it would slow Monkey S1&S2 down even more, not enough seeders ATM (might try real soon but)"
,TrulisRohk,2005-08-09T05:53Z,"Ok, I need 2 know y my share ratio doesnt move??? Im not prepared to release more stuff under a tracker that doesnt work!!!"
,ramjet,2005-08-12T00:10Z,"Not sure what's up with the tracker, my ratio had stuck for ages, then all of a sudden when I checked it had jumped right up to what i thought it should be. Weird :0/"

,AussiePT,2007-09-26T17:10Z,"There are currently 10-15 people trying to download this torrent, almost half of them stuck on 81%, could we ask TrulisRock or anyone who downloaded this in the past to re-seed it? At least till one of the current ones manage to reach 100% and carry on the torch? Thanks TrulisRohk and everyone else that may be albe to help."
,blondejon,2007-10-01T08:38Z,"mines at 85% and none of the files are complete which bloweth teh goat, a little help for the remaining 15% and then i can keep the torch going till others complete :)"
,Myconid,2007-10-08T16:27Z,"I second the request of randomname1000-- the quest is as of  yet incomplete, without the final six episodes dubbed in 2004!!! 

TrulisRohk, where are you in our hour of need?!!?

However, if you have fallen upon the Way, with it's many dangers, may Lord Buddha bless you for this mighty gift of Monkey Magic that you have bestowed upon us. Truly it cannot be said you did not endeavor with mighty purpose."
,TrulisRohk,2007-12-08T00:23Z,Im sry guys i had a hard drive give up the ghost & didnt have Monkey backed up :(

,ozzyozborne,2008-01-17T21:41Z,"Again I ask, which episodes are missing or incomplete? I can possibly create a torrent including the missing/incomplete episodes if their is enough requests. BTW, l would need the actual episode titles, not just the episode number to make sure i seed the right ones."
