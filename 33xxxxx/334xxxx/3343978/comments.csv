I'm looking desperately for DROWNING BY NUMBERS - french subs is great (I live in France). Could you upload it for me? I see that the comment is vert old... If I could make you happy with something, i'd do! Otherwise the films you offer are divine...! Thank you a lot. "
,zeinabqureshi,2008-04-28T08:19Z,"What an incredible screenplay. You could just read the subtitles (you can have it from here: http://www.opensubtitles.com/en/download/sub/208480), what he shows on screen is not up to much. But what an incredible script!
Thanks for sharing this one... "

,ProphetZarquon,2012-02-18T23:03Z,"NOTE TO ALL UPLOADERS:
It's pointless to complain about nobody seeding if you pack your Torrent files with RAR files.

The first thing most people do when opening a RAR file is to extract the contents and then delete the archive.  Otherwise, it would waste double space.

Torrents do not suffer from corruption.  There is no benefit to RAR compression on video for a torrent.

DO NOT PACK TORRENT CONTENTS INTO RAR FILES. Your torrent will die a sad lonely death with no new seeders to keep it alive."
