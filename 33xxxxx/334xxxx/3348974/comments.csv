Time for a new build now i think.
Cool that u found a program to easily delete the dupes ;-)
All dupekiller Programs i could find that time, were completely unable to work within only one dir ... minimum was 2 dirs ...
So i was forced to squeeze this ""complicated"" method outta my brain ... Dont u love these ideas coming to you on the toilet or under the shower ;-))"

I think your problem is that after you unRAR this Update Pack, you're unzipping Milkdrop.zip.  XBMC can now read the presets within a .zip archive.  UnRAR the Update Pack and then copy the entire ""visualisations"" folder over into your XBMC installation.

Good luck!"
