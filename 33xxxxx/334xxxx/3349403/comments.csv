,mathsped,2005-08-08T18:42Z,"Nordic subs ??????

I guess some morons don't know that Denmark is part of the Nordic countries....sigh....

P.S. What other ""Nordic"" subs are missing ?"
,mathsped,2005-08-08T19:14Z,"Hmmm...it DOES have Danish subs. Only that the menu is screwed up a bit.

Sorry, and thanks for the seed !"
,bhattsin,2007-01-17T17:54Z,I'm stuck at 97.6 since many days! Could someone seed please???????
,kintelen,2007-12-07T16:01Z,"Could someone take a toil of seeding? The matter is that i have a strange habbit of having 100 percent of a file instead of 87,5 that i have now."

Subtitles are all 4 Nordic (not Icelandic) and Eng, Dutch, Port. In addition: Hebrew, Arabic (probably), Russian, Turkish and Greek. The MENU for the subs is incomplete, you have to choose them with the remote."
