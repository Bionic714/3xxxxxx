,xwoz,2005-06-15T05:07Z,"why so small? is this a reencode of a vcd?  what is your source? past experience tells me anything this small has crap quality. stinks too, I'd really like to see a good rip of this one. . ."
,sandman44,2005-06-15T14:30Z,It's not a reencode of anything. It is a DVD rip from a actual DVD minus all the menu and other stuff. As far as quality goes you won't find better.  I too was surprised when I ripped the DVD to find only 2 Gig.
