YES SIR.
           THIS IS THE GOOD OL F-22 LIGHTNING 3  GAME FROM 1998. I KNOW IT HAS A LARGE CAPACITY. BUT IT WORKS FINE. THE AUDIO  FILES HAVE BEEN EXTRACTED AS WAVS, WHICH IS THE REASON THIS GAME IS SO BIG. THE GAME WORKS PERFECTLY GREAT. WHEN YOU WISH TO PLAY ONLINE. JUST UPDATE THE GAME.

IF ANYONE AFTER DOWNLOADING THIS GAME, CAN RE COMPRESS AND UPLOAD IT, THAT WILL BE FINE. YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION TO DO SO. UPLOAD IT AT AS MANY PLACES AS YOU LIKE.
