i guess the boys at novalogic never thought someone would actually share a 2 gb file over the internet, lol"

I FOUND A VIRUS IN THE FILE
....NO-CD CRACKL3.exe

A TROJAN HORSE IRC/BACKDOOR.SDBOT.CS"
,tmjam2002,2005-07-01T00:27Z,It is not my torrent. Someone else released it I just shared here. And no there is no virus. The crack file could be detected as a virus by many stupid antiviruses. Anyways enjoy the game
,tmjam2002,2005-07-06T19:26Z,BY THE WAY NO-CD CRACK IS ALWAYS DETECTED AS A VIRUS. IGNORE IT.
