As Rhino has done throughout its Have A Nice Day series, this is an interesting look at the Seventies as presented by artists of the era whose fame was short-lived. The compilers at Rhino assume you already have Stevie Wonder, Elton John, Chicago and Paul McCartney in your music library. So they have filled in the gaps with a collection of mostly one-and two-hit wonders. [Only Gilbert O'Sullivan and Charlie Daniels reached the Top 10 more than once!]

Not that there aren't plenty of big hits here. Five of these songs were million-sellers: The lightweight pop smash "Playground in My Mind," the POSEIDON ADVENTURE theme "Morning After," the country-crossover "Funny Face," the usually maudlin Gilbert O'Sullivan gets funky with "Get Down" and the banjo-guitar duet from DELIVERANCE "Dueling Banjos."

For me, the treats of volume 11 are the topical humor of Charlie Daniels' hilarious "Uneasy Rider" and the melancholy of Jud Strunk's "Daisy a Day. [Strunk is probably best remembered as a former cast member of "Laugh-In."]

Several of these tracks, however, weaken the overall impact of the collection. "Big City Miss Ruth Ann" was Gallery's last gasp in the Top 40 before becoming candidates for "Where are they now?" trivia. El Chicano's "Tell Her She's Lovely" spent one week at No. 40 before dropping off the chart entirely. Still, that was a better chart performance than Albert Hammond's "Free Electric Band." Songs like these didn't enter the American musical conscience thirty years ago, why bring them back now? It would have made more sense to include such 1973 hits as Sweet's "Little Willy," Billy Preston's "Space Race," or Loggins & Messina's "Your Mama Don't Dance."

Overall, there's enough big hits here to make the set interesting, but enough duds to keep this from being truly essential.
