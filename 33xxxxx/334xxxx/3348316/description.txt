bet you didn't know that old cereal icon 'Sugar Bear' had his own cartoon show in the 60's!  One of his very own is here as well as possibly one of the funniest and wittiest shows ever created called 'Roger Ramjet' with one of his shorts.  Heckle And Jeckle, Space Patrol, really old 30's Van Beuren cartoons, a Howdy Doody Christmas special, and other rarities fill out the package.  Enjoy..
