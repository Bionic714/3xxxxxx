This is Linux answer to a mediaplayer. It runs everything.

examples:
AVI
MPG
MP4
WMV
MOV
RM
etc.

Doen't have the codec? Doens't matter mplayer runs it.

You will need to right click the moviefile and select Open ass (or something like that; my windows ain't in english, sorry)
And then find the Mplayer.exe

I't havent any fancy controlpanel. It's only a player, but there is a keyboard shortcut list in the directory.
