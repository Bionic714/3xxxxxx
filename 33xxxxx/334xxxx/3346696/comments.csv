,Lautsprecher,2005-06-20T17:04Z,"I'd wish their was a stripped XP with only drivers(S-ATA, GFX etc.), and not 5000 programs i don't use. Is that so hard to do?"
,Flammen01,2005-06-20T17:48Z,"You could probably do that yourself.. just need the right tools. Can probably use this version as a basis, and work from it. It's also possible to add drivers, but it's hard. "
,Flammen01,2005-06-20T20:33Z,"it's not all about saving diskspace. If you remove all the usless drivers and shit you dont need, the install goes faster, and windows generally acts faster. 

but.. whatever keeps your boat floating :)"
,brandonlink,2005-06-21T05:23Z,"do only need to burn in nero in image format then install, you dont reboot with cd in drive??. And do you have to format your drive inorder to install xp, or can it format or erase all the shit on the drive for you because i dont know how to do that and i only have one drive=c-drive which cannot be formated."
,Flammen01,2005-06-21T19:22Z,"I'm not totally sure, but i dont think you can ""upgrade"" to this version. It has to be a formattet drive, and boot the PC from this disk.

But.. i forgot to write that the first thing to do is to unrar the rarfile. Then there is a nero image and a nfo file :-)"
,brandonlink,2005-06-22T02:46Z,"if i have to format my only drive then how do  i do that because i tried rightclicking on it and formating it but it said i have to quit disk utilities or quit programs that use that drive and its my only drive, so how do i format it because i now know that you just extract the rar file onto disc and burn if im right but how do i format????/?"
,Flammen01,2005-06-23T01:53Z,"boot the PC with the cd in. You will get to the setup progress, there you can choos witch drive to install on, and format the drive."
,Flammen01,2005-06-24T11:20Z,that is the problem with piratebay.. too many leechers.. :/
,lemon_z,2005-06-27T15:10Z,"Arh.. ETA: 4 days! Guess I'll have to move my PC into the basement.. I can't stand the noise.. One question: how does this win work in terms of stability, heavy usage etc?"
,Flammen01,2005-06-27T15:22Z,I have had no problems with this version.. works like a charm
,brandonlink,2005-07-05T18:07Z,"the release nfo should be opened with microsoft word or something like microsoft word and u will see serial, i can paste serial here for yall but it wouldnt be a good idea"
,brandonlink,2005-07-05T18:07Z,ive not tested my cd i burned the xp onto yet but it was really easy to extract and burn what i extracted on to a cd using nero.
,brandonlink,2005-07-14T05:49Z,THIS SHIT IS NOT ENGLISH BUT REAL XP OS
,Flammen01,2005-07-14T11:48Z,no shit sherlock?
,lemon_z,2005-07-20T18:37Z,Forget it.. huge driver error.. The newest Nvidia driver doesn't support HL2
,Flammen01,2005-07-20T20:09Z,directX works fine.. get a fix for your nvidia driver :)
,BlueEagle,2006-03-08T11:02Z,"brandonlink: If you don't know how to install an OS or partition your drive or even format the one partition you've got then you have got NO business messing with this file.

Get a clue and let your dad fix the computer."
,scix,2006-03-08T13:41Z,"Noen som har en serial til xp pro, sp2 no. som de vil dele. Har cd men ingen serial =)"
,ParadoXia,2006-05-11T19:22Z,"scix:
