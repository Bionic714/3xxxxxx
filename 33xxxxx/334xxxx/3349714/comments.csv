""The game Mugen 2 was produced in the year 2000 by ""Elecbyte"". This is one of the much so called 2d fighting games. Mugen 2 is the best game in the dragon ball series that was created for the PC. The product has only got a english version #here is something written that i cant understand... something with ""Not japanese""#
To start you need a 380,263 #:S# with a processor of 166Mhz, 16Mb ram and windows 98, (With XP it will have problems, but it still will work).
