 The 4400
 #2.01: Wake-Up Call     
 Sun Jun 05 2005 (runtime: 60 min)

 It's been one year since the 4400 returned. After a period of intense      
 medical observation, Tom has returned to NTAC in a limited capacity,       
 assigned only to desk duty. Diana, having been through a series of inept   
 partners, finally finds a way to cut through the red tape and get Tom back,
 all while in the midst of formally adopting Maia. Meanwhile, Richard, Lily 
 and the baby are still living in meager conditions in a mountain cabin far 
 away from Jordan. Jordan has now closed Arcadia Estates, and is on the     
 verge of opening "The 4400 Centers," a place for non-members of the 4400 to
 discover "the 4400 within themselves." Collier becomes Shawn's guardian,   
 and enlists him to heal important benefactors of the Centers.
