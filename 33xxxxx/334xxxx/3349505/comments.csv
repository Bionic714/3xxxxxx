,phish007,2005-06-28T05:38Z,can u burn rented movies with this? anyone know of a mac prog that can?
,cyklist,2005-06-28T09:14Z,"don't know Popcorn (jet) but DVD copy is a3 step operation:
1) rip the DVD to disc - use MacRipper, it also removes the coding and is free
2) compress the data to fit on a single side DVD-R (or DVD+R) - use fx. DVD2oneX (needs serial)
3) burn the resulting VIDEO_TS (and an empty AOUDIO_TS) folder to DVD as in DVD-ROM or UDF format - use fx. Toast 6
Make shure the DVD name only includes capital letters or underscores (for older DVD-players)
OK? need more help? ask!"

,jbaxon,2005-08-11T07:34Z,"Yeah, when I try to drag a VIDEO_TS file into this program, it closes. NO matter what I do, it closes every time. Any ideas why?"
,emil775,2005-08-12T00:56Z,"no clue...doesn't do that to me. Try re-downloading, it's a small file."
,mac-gyver,2006-01-11T15:15Z,This happens to me too. Program closes down:(
,superche2005,2006-01-17T20:31Z,"Which OS do U use? Yesterday I worked with 10.3 everything worked well. Now, I upgraded the OS into 10.4 and know the application closes whenever I select a movie. I am working with the older Popcorn version (1.0). Are there similarities? Does anybody know the solution for this. Opening the .dmg file was a problem as well. It wouldn't open."
,Odda,2006-05-11T10:07Z,WARNING! Do not work with Mac OSX >= 10.4
,JerryAttrick,2006-11-16T23:54Z,"Had to upgrade to 2.01, but now I can't find a serial that works... any ideas?"
,marcoppini,2006-12-27T16:29Z,"I just downloaded POPCORN but I can't install cuz I don't have the serial number. Does anyone know??? I think I have the first version.

I have 2 serial numbers for popcorn 2, but they didn't work for me, maybe will work for you!!!!
