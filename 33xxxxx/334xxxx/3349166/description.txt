Here are 41 classic Terrytoon Heckle & Jeckle shorts.  Regretablly, 12 shorts are missing from the entire run of 53 cartoon shorts, but these are very rare and hard to come by.  The first short was made in 1946 and the very last one was 'Messed Up Movie-Makers' in 1966.  These used to be shown in syndication packages throughout the 70's and early 80's, but have not been on the air in a very long time.
