peace"
,wangho75,2005-06-27T20:06Z,That link didnt work for me.  I was hoping that it would shed some light and show me the error of my ways.  In the future Ill will try and refrain from upping content that may be offensive in some way.  My next torrents will be the complete Baby Looney Tunes and the first season of Blue's Clues.  
,wangho75,2005-07-23T03:17Z,"ok, Ill seed it once again"

,Darth_Diabolicus,2008-05-26T01:18Z,"Crap, the 1 seed is gone and I'm still hanging @ 0.15% left.  PLEASE will someone out there reseed for a little while for me and I will pick up the seeding of this torrent as soon as I have a complete copy.  I don't know why it says 0 leeches 'cause I'm still trying to download it. Thnx."

What are you missing ?  I may have them."
,ItchyBrother,2010-01-17T06:32Z,"Mine is exactly the same as the others - stuck at 99.9 % - 06 - The Intruders is at 96.7% all others are at 100%. If someone could upload this episode, others can have a complete set too."
,dielaughing,2011-10-27T22:02Z,"this torrent's over ten years old.. it's not the greatest bit of animation, but it's a collective/keeper and a damn shame it's got zero seeds.. I'd sure like to get these.. no way of messaging the uploader.. thats the one complaint i have about TPB.. theres no messaging system..."
