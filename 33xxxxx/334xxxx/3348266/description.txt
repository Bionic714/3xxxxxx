Originally from Birmingham, SRC started out as the Tremelos,
and later, as the Fugitives. They became soon part of the
Detroit based rock/psychedelic movement with other well known
bands like the Amboy Dukes and the MC5. This show reflects
perfectely their acid guitar psychedelic sound with a big Doors'
influence. The cover of the Dylan's song is a gem, such as 
"black sheep" and "show me".
