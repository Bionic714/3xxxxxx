.//RIP NOTES//--
. 
. Most likely the most anticipated game of this year. It's insane how
. hyped this game is. And after playing the game I saw why. This simply
. is a great game. A great game, with little music =( Only 15 minutes
. worth of actual music. The rest is just silence, or ambience that 
. I didn't include.
.
. The big reason why I got this game was because of a rumor, TooL 
. did the main theme... I found out this isn't true, since Chris Vrenna
. did it (drummer of Nine Inch Nails, KMDMF, Stabbing Westwards, Die 
. Warzau and Pig Face) together with Clint Walsh (guitarist on remixes
. of U2 and P.O.D.). However, the main theme really is a great track
. to listen to, and does have a TooL-feeling over it.
