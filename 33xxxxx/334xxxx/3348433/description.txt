In the 9th grade, Meyers co-wrote "Anticonformity" while at a youth camp. The song quickly became her personal mission statement. Krystal explains, "Anticonformity is more than nonconformity. Nonconformity is not doing what the world wants you to do. Anticonformity is actively being something else - in some cases, the exact opposite of what the world is trying to make you."
