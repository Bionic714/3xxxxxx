Changes from AnyDVD v5.2.3.1 to AnyDVD v5.2.4.1 

New: Added support for a new version of the "Sony ARccOS protection" as found on "Closer" R2 (UK, German, Italian) to the option to remove "Protection based on unreadable Sectors" (it should really work now) 
Fix: If AnyDVD was disabled, the "no drive" dialog could be displayed 
Fix: If AnyDVD was first disabled and then enabled within the settings dialog, disc changes were no longer correctly detected 
Fix: Bug which could prevent correct backup of early Arccos protected titles, e.g. Wrestlemania 3 (UK)
