,MMacairan,2006-02-01T03:46Z,"How do you use these files?  I unarchived them and got five folders (CD1 - CD5). In each folder is two files with names like:

c-lhr1.bin and  c-lhr1.cue

I don't know what to do now. "
,MMacairan,2006-02-01T03:58Z,Found my own answer. Sorry for the dumb question.
,AURAMAXIMUS,2006-04-15T22:56Z,"Download Alcohol 120%:
-Go to Virtual Drives and create 5 V. Drives
-Go to image finder and select the location in which you saved the files and select or double click each file to list them on your main window
-On the main window right click each file one by one to go to ""Mount on Drive"" e.g. (O:), (P:), (Q:)...etc and select a designated drive for each .bin file.
-On your Main Menu select ""Image Burning Wizard"": Select Next and choose your settings and/or select the Burner you'll be using"
,AURAMAXIMUS,2006-04-15T23:01Z,"You can also do an install from these virtual drives, they will be listed along side your Physical Drives.

Once you're finished with the installs just go to each virtual drive, right click and select Un-mount Image."

,gianman26,2008-02-23T04:27Z,"hello to all, I surely undestand the comment about ""if ppl donÂ´t know how image files work, how are they gonna understand hacking?""....

but I think that it was brave to admit when we do not understand something, so instead of saying dumb comments about it, lets put answers and help each other out... and that is the real way of thinking of a real hacker. 

""THANKS AND LETS SEED ON AND SHARE AS MUCH KNOWLEDGE AS YOU CAN..."" Gian

ps: you can also use a program called daemon tools and it would be of help to visit wikipedia and read about the ""disk images"" and how to deal with them"
