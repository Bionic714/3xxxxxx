,Monkey_D_Luffy,2005-07-22T19:25Z,"Works great on epsxe. However, if you want the best experience:

1. PC version is best -- better graphics, sound, faster gameplay.
2. Normal PS1 version is 2nd -- better graphics, sound.
3. epsxe version is ok if you have a fast CPU(over 2GHz AMD recommended by me, with at least a radeon 9800 Pro and 512MB of pc-3200). You can play around with the video settings to get a better picture, and you will want to change the audio settings so you get all the audio that was in the original PS1 game."

""if you want the best experience:

1. PC version is best -- better graphics, sound, faster gameplay.""

WHAT KIND OF RETARDED STATEMENT IS THAT?

The PC version's graphics look MUCH crappier, and the sound is just MIDI files!! The PlayStation (original) version has the orginal wav sound! Far, far, far superior to the PC version.

Playing FF7 on the PC destroys the feeling of the game. It's totally different. Like a completly different game.

Mainly because of the music, the music makes up 50% of the game, and the PC versions music sucks hard. It sounds like some kiddy Mario game or whatever."
,jayman11,2006-11-29T04:23Z,im at disc 2 and im at the part where you learn about the hope materia. after i put the key to the ancients in the music box the water comes down. when i go in it bunagen says that the screen is used to project an image. i read it is suposed to show aeris dying but instead the screen stays black. how do i fix this?
,CursedGroin,2007-01-05T10:50Z,"@ Osaka:
Actually, the PSX version's music was only MIDI too. Difference is, the MIDI samples on the PSX was either better, or customized by the composer, I don't know which.

But the PC version is buggy as hell, and the graphics are inferior. However, playing the PSX game with an emulator with high graphics settings will give you much more beautiful 3d models. ;)

as soon as the old guy finishes talking and i try to enter the waterfall, the screen goes black. Can someone please help me with this?"
,alliexcoeur,2007-05-25T07:11Z,"Ok, for those of you having trouble after putting the ""key to the ancients"" on disc2, I have worked on a ""simple"" solution, and it works!

Here it is:

1. Run the 2Disc ISO.
2. Use the Save State feature on slot 1 right before you enter
   the room with the waterfall.
3. Now enter the room and wait for the black screen and run forward.
When Bugenhagen gets to the part where he says
""Look! Look at the image projected on the screen of the water!""
press the circle button to continue and your screen will flash with the
characters standing.  Press ESC before it fades completely,
and change your disc to the 3rd disc.
4. It will fade back in to the characters who aren't doing anything.
Press ESC again and this time, load the 2nd disc.  A FMV will play.
5.  After the FMV, the screen will turn black and you will have to go
through a bunch of text... you will hear error messages now and then
but don't worry about it.  As soon as cloud starts talking about
Sephiroth, hit ESC and save state to slot 2.  
Continue and You will hear one last error message when
there is no more text.  Run downwards and wait for the screen to flash
With Bugenhagen standing.  Press ESC, and load the 3rdDisc.
6.When you're back outside, press ESC again and load disc 2.

That's all!"

3. Click as far as you can until the text boxes stops showing

To Kolkkero: If the rest of your game works fine with your graphics card, then you should have no problem going through the problematic  scene.  The last thing I could advice you is to send me your savestate, preferrably, the memory card save.  Then I could do it for you.

Ive spent alot of time trying to sort everything for this and this is really annoying me.

no need for fancy switching of disks. just use alcohol(or daemon tools) and mount the disk 2 in one of your virtual drives. then, load the it as a cd(if you are using psx v1.11 like me: File > Insert CD Drive) and voila. 

You get to see the scene + fmv too(no black screens). :)"

,themeanxtime,2008-04-08T17:59Z,"Reading this thread I noticed that a lot of mac users are having some trouble running this game.

I am going explain what I did to run it and hopefully I can help someone out.

I am using an Imac Power PC G5
with 1.8ghz and 1G RAM

1) Download PCSX it's a a great psx emulator

2) Once the files are downloaded extract the using 7-zip (yes, it is available for mac you should find it with a quick google search)

3)You will see that all the disk's are in .ISO files, all you have to do is go on disk 1, press Control Click and click on Mount It. The game will appear on your desktop as if it was a cd is your cd drive.

4) Open up PCSX and click File-> Run Disk and FF7 should start up.

I did not change any of the plug-ins

The game works fine except when you enter battle it slows down.I played around with the setting to no avail. If someone has a fix for this please let me know!

I hope I was of some help to mac users.

,Darkstar81,2009-05-28T08:31Z,DO NOT download this torrent it useless as some1 has cut out alotta fmv stuff makin it more prone to crash only get this game off of trusted people
,Doctrinius,2009-05-29T02:18Z,"I've read through a lot of the proposed fixes to the infamous bug at the end of CD 2 with Bugenhagen.

I'm grateful for the people who have contributed, but I simply cannot get it to work. I've tried the method laid out on page 3 of the comments several times, and here's my problem. I get to the part where you're supposed to change the CD to disc 3, at which point the characters are supposed to freeze and be unable to move. This doesn't happen to me, instead, the game simply progresses to the same buggy black screen with the ""error"" sound regardless of whether I change CDs or not. 

If anyone has any solution I'd be very grateful. Thanks."

,FixedmyFF,2009-06-14T08:37Z,"Those of you having trouble with the black screen near the end of disc 2. 
First go into ""Config Cdrom"" in your epsxe.
and I chose P.E.Op.S. CDR Driver 1.4
Then I loaded up disc 2 in Daemon tools instead of running the iso from epsxe
Then I loaded up my saved state.
This method worked out great for me.. just in time.. I was going to lose it trying that iso change method (which i guess would have worked in 1.6.0_) good luck"
,kaniboy1986,2009-06-19T02:16Z,whats with disc 3 there is no image file in the rar (unless it didnt download correctly) well i got img but that aint an iso like the rest what do i do with it

,cynikal89,2009-12-04T12:01Z,"Well, I've searched arround more and it seems like running the disk on CD-Rom should do the trick.

I'm having a problem with this however: When any of the 3 disks on Daemon tools lite, 4.30.0027 and boot up the game, nothing displays. I'm assuming this is because the game isn't starting up.

I have P.E.Op.S cd-rom plugin, and I tried to set it up the best I could, and it's not getting me anywhere... Does anyone have any ideas?"
,cynikal89,2009-12-04T12:15Z,"I got it working finally

FIX FOR THE BLACK SCREEN AT THE END OF DISK 2 (city of ancients waterfall)

1) Mount the file with Daemon tools
2)Make sure you have the P.E.Op.S cd-rom plugin
YOU MUST CONFIG THE PLUG-IN (Read the read me, it explains it pretty well)
3) Run ePSXe
4) Click File-> CD Rom... And you're all done!

Best of luck to everyone."

1. Nope, unless your ps3 is modded, and even then there currently arent any reliable modding methods with-out a high probability of damaging your system.

2. Short and simple answer PSX version has anti aliasing, and PC version lacks that."

,hooray4vuze,2010-09-06T02:52Z,"Forgotten city glitch solution :)

1.after the key is inserted into the music box and you see the FMV of the waterfall save your game using ePSXe save state feature. do not enter the waterfall just yet
2.using deamon tools lite mount the final fantasy 7 disc 2 iso file to the E drive(that should be the default drive)
3. close out of the ePSXe and re-open it, go to the configuration section and choose cdrom
4.my plugin for this is ePSXe CDR WNT/W2K core 1.7.0., and i left this as it was. hit the configure button on this screen
5.the screen that pops up should say select cdrom letter, and it will be on first cdrom, change that to E
6.hit okay and then from the ePSXe chooose run cdrom intead of iso
7.then hit escape and load up your save state in front of the waterfall, the glitch should now be gone and you can switch back to an iso file after you leave the forgotten city. wish i figured this out before i lost 8 hours if power training before hand hahah peace!"

,Paweuuu,2012-05-12T00:58Z,"I've passed through the forgotten city crash ! it's quite easy...
If you are playing on ePSXe 1.7.0 you need to do exacly what i say :)

1. Download ePSXe 1.6.0 (copy all plugins and bios from 1.7.0 folder)
2. Playing 1.7.0 Save state 1 just before entering the waterfall
3. Copy Save states from ePSXe 1.7.0 folder to 1.6.0
4. Enter waterwall useing ePSXe 1.6.0 and do the following:

 A. Now enter the room and wait for the black screen and run forward.
 When Bugenhagen gets to the part where he says
 ""Look! Look at the image projected on the screen of the water!""
 press the circle button to continue and your screen will flash with the
 characters standing. Press ESC before it fades completely,
 and change your disc to the 3rd disc.
 B. It will fade back in to the characters who aren't doing anything.
 Press ESC again and this time, load the 2nd disc. A FMV will play.
 C. After the FMV, the screen will turn black and you will have to go
 through a bunch of text... you will hear error messages now and then
 but don't worry about it. As soon as cloud starts talking about
 Sephiroth, hit ESC and save state to slot 2. 
 Continue and You will hear one last error message when
 there is no more text. Run downwards and wait for the screen to flash
 With Bugenhagen standing. Press ESC, and load the 3rdDisc.
 D.When you're back outside, press ESC again and load disc 2.
(this guide is not mine it's on page 3)

5. Now Save state !
6. Copy save states from 1.6.0 to 1.7.0
7. Enjoy (you can delete whole 1.6.0 folder)
