Mounted the iso file to the virtual drive (using daemon tools)
Double clicked auto-run
Then selected 2nd option in the setup menu (the one which installs the english version)
after about 10 mins of isntallation i restarted my comp and VOILA! 
>_> although it does kinda lag on my comp , need to buy new video card... the radio and the movie files are also missing , but heck you can import your own mp3's and turn on subtitles >_>.

,tjspyder18,2005-07-12T09:36Z,"Hey for all the CONFUSED PEOPLE - READ THE FOLLOWING!!! The nearly 700MB File that you downloaded is the file that you mount with Daemon Tools. 

So this is exactly what you do after you've downloaded the 671 MB File.

1. Right click the Daemon Tools thing in the lower right side of the desktop.

2. Go to Virtual CD/DVD Rom, then ""Mount Image""

3. Browse to the spot where your 671MB File is downloaded and click on it to mount.

4. Very soon after that (1-10 Secs), a screen will come up with three things you can click on - the first is a Russian Installation, Second (middle) an english installation, and the last is cancel. After that you just wait while it installs itself.

5. After its done, in Russian it will say you have to restart your computer. Click it, and it will restart.

6. After restarting, the shortcut will be on your desktop. Click it. If you stilll have any problems - I don't know what to tell you.

Please post feedback so I can know if I helped anyone out! "

,Mental112,2005-07-14T01:27Z,The choice of language is the last screen before the game actually installs. It's set to russian by default so click on the bottom choice and then continue with the install. P.S. Seed people. I'm currently at 206%. It's the least I could do for getting a free game.

Great rip, but how do I use the English version?

The Russian and English folders are empty, so I can only go to F:Setup and it is in Russian, I think. My game runs really slow because of the graphics settings, the game is in Russian so I cannot change the settings.

Everything else is great, I reccommend downloading this file. Maybe someone will release a rip of the audio files. Thanks."

,harryh97,2010-02-14T07:22Z,"Hey Everyone, Big thanks to fellu!
This is how i installed it:
1.Download Utorrent
2.Download MagicISO Virtual DVD/CD Manager
3.Download The Torrent.
Should take about a day to download because thats how long it took me.
4.In the bottom right corner where the time and mini icons are right click The one of a hand holding a disc.
5.Virtual CD/DVD Rom, K:no media, Mount.
6.Open your ISO file once it is finished downloading.
7.Start, My Computer, GTA San Andreas.
8.The installer is in russian, click the box that has funny writing and has a save icon.
9.Keep Clicking the box with the > arrow in it.
10.Then you will come to a thing with two circles, click the bottom circle.
11.It will take about 15 mins to install, so go do a crap or something.
12.Wipe Your Bum, wash your hands, Dry them and Just click the box with the > arrow in it.
13. A shortcut will be on your desktop GTA San Andreas Double Click and enjoy.
14. And for you people who like to complain i'll say one more thing that might help, I did this on an XP.
15. I Downloaded this for modding, I have the XBOX Version and have beaten the game.
16.One more thing Fellu, the sound for talking and radio don't work, but the files are all in C/Program files/Game/GTA-SanAndreas/Audio/Streams. I Coded them as OGG Files and the Game Crashed, So i reinstalled, Then i reallised there is a SCRIPT in the sfx folder, did you miss out on the streams script or something, because i love the swearing and music on the game. THANKS A MILLION FOR THE TORRENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
