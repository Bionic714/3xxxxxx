I don't know if the real ""REAL Player"" allows -
Audio Selection ?

But  'Real Alt 1.22' does not."

English can be heard only in background.It is not clear and very difficult to hear even in RealPlayer. / You could have clearly stated that in the torent/ In any case, thank you very much for your effort in encoding it  and sharing it. Appreciate that! "

Do a search on these 2 terms to get details. //If anyone knows of a player or any other s.w for this , please share that info."
