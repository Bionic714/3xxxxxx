,Postoasted,2005-06-13T08:55Z,"About 6 months ago I downloaded an earlier version of ""Windows Borg."" That version didn't work. Would someone please let us know if this version works.

 Thanks"
,bartofborg,2005-06-13T16:15Z,"Didn't work???? Highly doubtful.....I have never released a non-working version! You either burned it wrong or never bothered to read the bug fixes of that version. I've improved them alot since V 1.0 but, bugs do tend to pop up!"
,Pyr0,2005-06-13T19:08Z,"i tried borg 4 also, and after installing windows, it rebooted, and just gave me a blank screen"
,bartofborg,2005-06-14T00:01Z,Another moron! READ THE POST BEFORE YOU! What part of your pea brain is too stupid to apply a fix or two? Does your mommy wipe your ass too! lol....
,boncuklar,2005-06-14T03:15Z,"Bartofborg dude, this all sounds really cool, but I already have a really cool way to keep my os exactly like I want it. So is there a way to get some of the cool parts of this borg thingy separate, especially this part: ""Borg Set-up, Logonoff screens along with a bunch of Star trek Wallpaper"" 
Thawoubecool!!! Totally!"
,gprime,2005-06-14T05:26Z,"bart, you are my hero. if this is as awesome as 4.0 (which i just installed today), then i'm already excited.

keep up the good work!"
,peres,2005-06-14T06:26Z,"About 5-6 months ago I downloaded an earlier version of ""Windows Borg 4.0 realy final and it's works just  GREATTTT !!!! thx bartofborg :D"
,jamima69,2005-06-14T17:12Z,"i've been a big fan of bartofborg's releases for years. whenever i need to install windoze on a machine,it's winborg for me. keep up the good work!!!!"
,gorma,2005-06-14T21:35Z,nice thnx man:)
,gprime,2005-06-16T04:18Z,"Just finished installing this. Very nice work, once again.

I'm an idiot and couldn't find the serials for a couple of programs (avast, and kerio) but I found them elseware.

A+"
,truetejas,2005-06-16T08:55Z,"I've got ver 4.0 and it works great!  What ""bugs"" have been fixed in ver 4.1?  Is it worth d/l again? Why is it back to such a big file (wasn't the last one 1.7 gig or similar)?  Thanks."
,Lathor,2005-06-16T21:01Z,I love it! Thanks a lot! Planning any 64-bit version soon?
,bartofborg,2005-06-18T05:24Z,"Not many glitches needed fixing...mostly just updated program files. I removed the Borg Boot screens, they were causing looping and restarting issues with P4's. I reinstalled the recycle bin, don't use it myself but, alot of peeps wanted it back, enabled driver roll back to allow .net framework to install."
,truetejas,2005-06-18T16:52Z,"Thanks, Bart.  Those are welcome refinements to an excellent product.  I'm still interested in the file size.  Were there problems with the condensed version of Rev 4.0?  I certainly didn't have any, and it was a lot quicker to D/L.  Also, the rule is, ""There is no such thing as final"".  :-)"
,T_D_F_S,2005-06-18T23:47Z,"I hope this is worth the wait!!  3537 mb file, Starting at ZERO, I have uploaded so far 4800 mb`s and have downloaded  only 76%  or 2780 mb`s....... "
,fastb,2005-06-20T21:54Z,Does this version support multiuser?
,bartofborg,2005-06-20T22:53Z,Yes!
,ge5239,2005-06-22T00:15Z,"sounds neat. 
is icons etc changed too, or just loginscreens? gonna use this on a small winpartition (fedora atm), would be nice if there was something else, other than login and a few install applications.. ;-) 

thx anyway, gonna dl, install and try, if i dont like i'll just reinstall the old thingie.. "
,-Gigga-,2005-06-24T03:34Z,"Im sorry but anyone who takes the time to gather much needed programs and serials , Also providing a Cracked Working updatable OS , and also saving you the hassle of installing most all the comonly used programs.

,DiscoBiscuit89,2005-07-01T05:01Z,"One small question -- I realize Winborg is 3.45GiB, but is it possible to break it up to install from a CD versus DVD?  I do not have a DVD player for my laptop.  Great program.  Works perfectly on my desktop.  Thanks for the effort that went into development."
,soulpredator,2005-07-01T13:47Z,"well i think you POWN... i LOVED the old version.. sure ill love this one.. 

I do have a question do.. the 4.0 version had a bug wich wouldnt let it work on some P4 systems (including mine) there was a fix for it wich worked perfectly.

My question is is it fixed in this version???  

Keep up the good work m8!! your a GOD to alot of us... :D"
,bartofborg,2005-07-05T05:27Z,Any bugs reported in Version 4.0 have beed fixed in 4.1 - including the hyperthreading issue!
,Singerman,2005-07-06T23:55Z,"i cant get this file to burn onto a dvd. ive tried Alcohol and Nero, neither have done it. i click on burn image to dvd. it starts then after 1% it says that there is an error and i cant find the error log to get the error. any suggestions? thanks"

,grappler,2005-07-07T00:28Z,"Do you have an idea why it would NOT boot in some computers, even do they boot with a regular cd but not with this dvd????
Any help would be HIGHLY appreciated.
by the way I tried this version in many pc's and it's GREAT."
,fekdep,2005-07-07T16:59Z,"Am I somehow missing something?

I don't have a ""Cracks and Serials"" folder or an ""Extra Proggies""

nor does it boot, but that I can get around."
,grappler,2005-07-07T21:54Z,"anybody who can help me. I downloaded this xp version and it works GREAT, the only problem that I'm having is that once I turn my pc on I get to the desktop but NO icons, so I'm forced to press Ctrl Alt Del , Log off and then Log on again and once I do that I get my icons and everything works perfect , fast and reliable, I tried this xp version in 4 different pc's and is the same problem????? :( Any Idea how to fix this???????? 
"
,crondor,2005-07-08T04:39Z,Downloaded and tried to load. During setup it says aliide.sys file missing. Is it just me or is there a way around this?
,bartofborg,2005-07-08T06:21Z,"This version was tested on 14 different comps and laptops before release.....if you are having install issues it will almost certainly be:
1. Poor quailty DVDs being used.
2. Improper burning setup or burning too fast.
3. Read errors due to poor quality DVD readerwriters."
,crondor,2005-07-09T16:06Z,"First, thanks bartofborg for the upload and for trying to help. I tried to reburn at a lower speed with several different dvds. I have a brand new sony burner. After dealing with it asking for a serial it starts to set up windows and always comes up with missing file  and stops setup. What am I doing wrong? Anyway thanks again. If nothing else all of the other programs will be very useful."
,verifex,2005-07-09T23:20Z,"Need more seeds, great pack."
,bartofborg,2005-07-10T08:02Z,The alliide.sys error is a known bug. It doesn't occur for everyone though... Please check the I386 folder and tell me IF you have the file or not.
,of_darkness,2005-07-10T17:53Z,windows instaler asks for serial... where is tehe serial?
,meddie,2005-07-10T21:26Z,PLZ PEOPLE IF YOU LIKE WINDOWS BORG PLZ SEED AT LEAST A HOUR OR SOMETHING :( :( PLZ PPL
,griff7,2005-07-11T16:11Z,"Im the same as chudddds on this. Everytime i try to install i get the error message 
    ""the file aliide.sys could not be found""
 I have the i386 file which contains it but just get the same fail.
 HEEEELLLLLPPP!!!"
,jmn,2005-07-15T20:52Z,"Borgs are cool!
bartofborg is also cool! -> Cheers!"
,charincol,2005-07-16T17:32Z,"This hangs with my hard drive light on solid after the installer loads all the drivers and says ""Starting Windows...""  Any ideas?"
,gazzad,2005-07-16T19:14Z,"Hi Bartofborg,

i am a true noob when it comes to burning cd/dvd's,so a bit of patience would be appreciated. How do you burn it as i did burn an ISO of 4.0 but it wouldn.t boot from cd/dvd. Please help as all these post's suggest something not to be missed
Regards gazzad"
,gazzad,2005-07-17T15:06Z,"do download if u want alot of usefull software,DONT download if u want what bartofborg supposedly offers as it doesnt work and he wont help coz hes too busy kissing his own ass .......basically hes a borg"
,gazzad,2005-07-18T10:03Z,Hey -Gigga- ur an ass licker aswell eh!
,wicord,2005-07-18T15:33Z,"really nice release !!!
works perfect for me hope you ll keep updating it."
[T],splattergod,2005-07-18T22:24Z,"No problems here...
In fact, I am writing this via my Borg system.
Installed flawlessly...
A couple of the software cracks don't stick well
(Any DVD) and the Photoshop CS crack comes up invalid, but other than that, it's awsome...
We simply downloaded, burned to DVD-r w/ Alchohol 120%, and loaded it into a NEW HARD DRIVE. If you are trying to upgrade from any other OS, this will NOT work, it has to be a brand new install.
My guess is those that are having problems, are trying to upgrade....
Also, as a side note, this was our FIRST attempt w/ ISO burning, etc, so if we got it to work the first time, I would guess that those with more experience shouldn't have any problems at all...

My question to Bartofborg is: can this handle a dual OS bootup? Any special tweaks needed?
Thanks,
SG"

Will having that second partition affect the install process or was this a bad burn and I should try alcohol 120%?  Or am I just being an idiot and should sell my computer to the magical hobo at the corner of the street?"
,ThePirateKing,2005-07-25T06:19Z,"Okay, I d/led the alcohol 120% free trial version and burnt it with that and retried burning it and it is installing just fine.  Conclusion:  NTI CD Maker sucks as bad as I've always thought it did and alcohol 120% rocks, lol.  ...and that partitions don't affect WinXP Borg.  THANKS BART!!!"
