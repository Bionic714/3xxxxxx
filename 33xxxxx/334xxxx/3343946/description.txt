Welcome to Windows XP Borg Edition V 4.1
 

 

 

 

Resistance is Futile - We are Borg!
Windows XP - Borg Edition V 4.1 Probably not Final! LOL…..


This edition has all the bug fixes and a few extra programs included. It also installs directly from the DVD - no installation files are copied to the Hard Drive that would need to be deleted later.....except some extra proggies in the “extra proggies” folder, which will be copied to the root drive during install. You can keep ‘em or delete ‘em, your choice!

 

**************DO NOT try to use this DVD for upgrading your present OS! You MUST do a fresh install!***************

After Windows installation is complete, All the Apps below will be installable via an installation selectable menu. You will have 2 1/2 minutes to select any apps you want before the Automatically selected default selections will be used! If you want more time, simply click on the clock or make 1 selection and the timer will halt. Select only one of each firewall and Anti-virus! You should not install more than one instance of either. Once selections have been made, hit the Begin Install button at the top left and all your selections will be assimilated silently! See below for exceptions!
Almost no serials or any interaction after selections are made will be needed! Auto-partitioning has been disabled. All required serial or cracks needed, that could not be pre-installed - are in the Serials and Cracks folder,
which will be copied to your Main Root Hard Drive ( usually C ).

Some Proggies like Symantec AV corp, CuteFTP and Winamp are not quite silent……..I have given up trying to make it so. You have to click a time or two for those proggies I’m afraid…..

3rd Party themes can be used - uxtheme.dll has been "fixed"

I have disabled a lot of reg tweaks I used before…….too many whiners. You’ll have to implement most of them yourself.

After Install is complete:

Open the Cracks and Serials folder and open the photoshop crack - follow the directions to activate it. Don’t bitch if it doesn’t work! I KNOW it does! If you can’t get it to work – your not following directions!

A few other proggies are not pre-cracked…..If the crackserial is not in the serials and cracks folder, I have included a file called “cracksearchers.rar” for you to find your own.
