=======================

Formed in early 2002, Charm CityÆs Isle of View launched
themselves into the Rock nÆ Roll mix hoping to become a
household name. Jeremy Blount (Bass) and Jon Riefler (Guitar)
decided to leave their old band during the winter of 2001 and
join forces with Nik Sherman (Guitar), their engineer at the
time, to start another band with dreams of endless success.
Adding Ken Sarracino (Vocals) and Steve Kuhn (Drums) to the
already determined trio, the band was on the much anticipated
road to national recognition. With the ability to write songs
that just wonÆt leave your head, the bands repertoire quickly
expanded as everyone added the IOV touch.

In a relatively short amount of time, IOVÆs fan base quickly
grew to proportions that made the dream turn to reality.
Playing alongside such acts as Lucky Boys Confusion, Prevent
Falls, Ok Go, and The K-Word only helped them to get their
name out. Filling out the Recher Theatre, FletcherÆs, the
Vault, and the Ottobar (to name a few) helped the band sell a
large number of their debut self released CD.

The ôIOV Formulaö has created endless possibility for this
group of guys as their success continues to grow. Recently
being picked up by Undecided Records with an attached
promotion and distribution deal through Victory Records and
Sony Entertainment, only shows further promise for the band. A
former engineer had this to say, ôIsle of View is like a
tackle box, they are full of hooks.ö Keep an eye and an ear
out for Isle of View in your world, as you wonÆt be
disappointed.
