,P37r1,2005-06-25T15:48Z,Va fan! Det står att de är 40 pers som vill ladda ner skiten men ingen connectar
,Mr.Cheese,2005-06-25T23:07Z,"Eftersom det finns så många envisa som ligger kvar här så hjälper jag till.
Har nyss laddat hem den från den andra torrenten.... "
,Mr.Cheese,2005-06-26T10:15Z,"First its not my torrent.
Second I have already a ratio over 1 wherefrom I dl it yesterday. Third I have uploaded nearly 1 gb on this torrent but it's not spreaded so well.
Depended of pgm you use, finnish allocation and then stop dl. Try the other torrent instead. Or copy all data and dl on that folder instead. Several full sources and realy good speed."
,Lightbreak,2005-06-26T12:58Z,"Just a side note, if you abort this download and go for http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3276967 , the hash checking will tell that the files differ, and you have to start from scratch (at least that was what I got when using Bitcomet). Although there more seeders at the other torrent so it may be worth it :)..."
,P37r1,2005-06-26T16:18Z,I am seedeng! But i only have 0.5mbit up and i am downloading my self so it goes about 35KB/s Up on this one.
,Mr.Cheese,2005-06-26T18:58Z,"If you use bittorrent you must first finnish allocation before you abort this download and start the other. And you might lose some bytes when there are diff size of parts + some files differs, like info and covers which will generate different bounds for the parts."

,CyberSurfer,2005-07-08T03:02Z,"i cant extract all the files in the VIDEO_TS folder, it says they are damaged. Can anyone please tell me what to do?"
