,gizmo_dk,2005-06-23T12:01Z,"Cool! I have been waiting for this for sooo long! Thank you! I will help spreading it, only have 256 up though... Again, THANKS!"
,bruceball,2005-06-23T12:05Z,I'm just wondering.. According to the info the source is a DVD5. Why has the extras been ripped then? I guess it's really a DVD9. Thank you in any case.
,gizmo_dk,2005-06-23T12:38Z,"in order to help spreading it, i have to receive some more parts of it first ;-)  so please seed soon."

,tlunde,2005-06-23T15:30Z,"Its amazing how good people are at complaining!! You can't expect to get a full DVD in just a couple of hours...so be PATIENT!!

And if the complaining continues, I'll simply just stop sharing the movie, and then you kan go buy it yourselfts!

So stop the F****** complain!!! "

,ConnyCannabis,2005-06-23T16:21Z,"Thanx tlunde, great job!!

They dont appreciate your work and time in ripping and uploading great stuff. Damn, please stop fucking with the man!!"

,animemgs,2005-06-23T17:35Z,btw.. WOW what a speed! 150 kb/s
,bruceball,2005-06-23T18:00Z,"tlunde, 300mb is good. It must be the one peer that you're uploading to that is the bottleneck here. All peers show 0,1% complete in my Azureus."
,gizmo_dk,2005-06-24T09:43Z,"no, that sounds very strange? All leechers are @ max 0.5% untill now. How does your Azureus config look like? Do you use Autospeed function? What networks are you uploading to? Also the ""publich IP network (not anonymous)""? How many standart max. uploads per torrent do you have set? are you behind a firewall? those 700mb, can you see where they have been send to?"
,Thom_Fubar,2005-06-24T10:01Z,Well.. Maybe u should try another program?
,tlunde,2005-06-24T10:32Z,Maybe I should stop trying to seed this movie instead??
