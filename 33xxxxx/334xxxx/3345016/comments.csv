,tverhoog,2008-12-11T12:10Z,"This looks very good. Thanks for the upload.

One request though, please just include the original music files in the torrent in stead of using a .rar file. This stimulates seeding, because with a .rar file most people are going to delete the archive once it's downloaded."
