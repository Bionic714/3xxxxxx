,wankan,2005-06-25T01:45Z,"I enjoyed this , thank you .

A note to English speakers . There are already subs embedded into the film (possibly Chinese) so the English subs will have to overlay these making it differcult to read (for me anyway) . I got around it by cutting off 40 pixels from the top and bottom which cut out the foreign subs then put the English subs onto the film (using Virtualdub) .

The film still looked fine and was very watchable .

Thanks again ."
