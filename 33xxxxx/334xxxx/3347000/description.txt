BLUE GATE CROSSING (Taiwan, 2002)
A bittersweet story of young people falling in love..


STORY:
A refreshing and uncommon look at growing up, Blue Gate Crossing is an honest exploration of first love and burgeoning sexuality among high school youth in Taiwan. Popular boy Zhang Shi Hao (Wilson Chen Bo Lin) is approached by Meng Ke Rou (Gwai Leon Mei), whose friend finds him attractive. Zhang believes that it's Meng who really is attracted to him, but as he gets to know the messenger of this youthful infatuation, deeper issues of sexuality and identity come to light. More might be at stake than just the first love between a boy and a girl, and the path one chooses may not be accepted by the society in which they live. Natural performances, elegant cinematography, and heartfelt, sensitive subject matter raise Yee Chin Yen's Blue Gate Crossing beyond boundaries of culture or sexuality, and into the realm of familiar human drama. A simultaneously sweet and surprisingly daring Taiwanese film, Blue Gate Crossing was nominated for Best Asian Film at the 23rd Annual Hong Kong Film Awards.
