,sarafanlord,2005-06-18T07:04Z,"Any help?....plz, From Brazil i do need to make this thingy works coz I am studying the English language, could someone help me?....thanx"
,rounder,2005-06-18T22:56Z,"sarafanlord: suggest you go for OED 'Oxford English Dictionary 2nd Ed v3.0' instead if you can't get this babe going. OED is working. and if your primary concern is the pronunciation (that OED ver3.0 doesn't provide, go for Encarta instead 'MICROSOFT.ENCARTA.REFERENCE.LIBRARY.PREMIUM.2005.DVD' ---"

Waiting........"
,rounder,2005-07-04T01:45Z,"boozoo: thx for info. that explains why I can't get this one going. if you, or anyone, happen to stumble across a solution, it would be great if you, please, post it here."
,cic,2005-07-10T15:59Z,"has anyone tried the following instructions?
posted at http://www.twt.edu.cn/software/detail.php?id=2109 for an emule release of an OAD7 image?

After the initial release of 
""[Dictionary]Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary 7th Edition.MythTW.iso"", 
I've received some reports that the iso version does not work.
I then started testing all the image creating mechaisms 
provided by Alcohol 120% (version 1.95 b. 2802) and 
after hours of repeatedly installation and testing, 
this is the one version that has been working all the time.
The working release includes 3 files, 

[Dictionary] Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary 7th Ed.MythTW.mdf
[Dictionary] Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary 7th Ed.MythTW.mds
[Dictionary] Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary 7th Ed.MythTW.txt

To get this release work, you can either 
1. mount with Daemon tools or virtual drives provided by Alcohol 120% or
2. burn it with Alcohol with Securerom *New(4.x/5.x) setting and
    enable the RMPS emulation provided by Alcohol/Daemon Tools
    when using the CD

Hope you all enjoy it.

Myth    4/30/2005

  Note: about Securerom 4.8 or later please read the link attached 
  at the buttom, u can further google search to know more about it.
   I'm aware there's twinpeaks trick to copy the securerom 4.8 
   protected CD without emulation, however, as it would not work 
   on all machines.

,cic,2005-07-10T16:06Z,hmmm. after reading the instructions again it seems to me that the image should be made with alcohol in a certain way to begin with...
,cic,2005-07-10T16:10Z,"so if you want a working version of this prog you should look for these files:
[Dictionary] Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary 7th Ed.MythTW.txt
[Dictionary] Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary 7th Ed.MythTW.mdf
[Dictionary] Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary 7th Ed.MythTW.mds"
,cic,2005-07-10T16:12Z,ps. emule is the only source i've found
