,highlymotivated,2005-06-16T16:13Z,"if you have azureus installed ""kick and ban"" all the unknowns under the ""peers"" tab.  my policy is this, if i don't know what kind of client their using, i'll kick and ban their ass.  download and install peerguardian as well.  it'll save you a lot of time."
,highlymotivated,2005-06-16T16:14Z,"oh yea, ""thanks"" tripwire!"
,KptnBlåskägg,2005-06-16T23:06Z,"highlymotivated: That sounds like a really stupid thing to do. The bad guys can easily disguise themselves as any well-known client, but you punish honest people with non-mainstream clients, which in the long term will lead to less diversity and therefore a more vulnerable network."
,bubbaganoush,2005-06-21T05:37Z,I fired up peergaurdian and I'm getting tons of blocks every second from Time Warner (basically owns HBO)
