,kanetsb,2005-06-13T15:30Z,"Yeah, good old Bard's Tale... Except this is a really crappy conversion from a X-Box game. Played the demo awhile back... Damn... that was not a pleasant experience. It's a something between Diablo and Tomb Rider kinda TPP game... Only thing good about it is the storyline an the narrator arguing with The Bard throught the game..."

,tlarseth,2006-07-16T04:52Z,"The real release was only 3.5GB.  Why is every version I see a lot bigger than this.

I think they just copied the folder into a zip file after it was installed."
