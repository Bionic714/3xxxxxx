Not much to say - just that this is a really good house set recorded at the Hultsfred festival in Sweden, 2002. A lot of influences by latin and salsa, this warm house music makes you think of nothing but a hot summer outdoor party :)

Apart from Sp√•nka, swedish house musik doesn't get much better than this in my opinion. Download, seed and write a comment!
