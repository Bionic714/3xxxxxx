,darthtravis28,2008-03-30T01:10Z,"I burned de game in a dvd, ok the xbox reads it, but there's no game, just the title screen that repeats over and over, what is it? someone was able to fix it yet?"
,Gefi78,2008-04-20T17:54Z,"How do all of you even find this torrent when you dont know squat about xbox piracy?

Here it goes(for this game).

- You need a modded xbox.
Hard modded with a chip or
Soft modded with software only(this is what i use, and i have softmodded xboxes for many of my friends and family. Its not that hard if you get all the parts needed. Google it!)

- WinRar to open the files.
They are devided into several small files instead of one big. This makes it easyer to redownload if one of the files screw up during a network breakdown or whatever.

- Qwix101 or xISOv115 or MagicISO or another program (i tend to use Qwix101) that can extract and make an XISO file(xiso have the same last name as an iso file, .iso). Just google ""Qwix101 download here"" (with the "") and you will get one result.

Qwix101 is also used to transfere xiso files from pc to xbox(high speed if you set the xbox to Avalaunch dash). In this case you have to have a modded xbox with a bigger hard drive.

- A software that can burn image files ( .iso). I usually use Alcohol 120%, but the other day i tried the free software ""Free Create-Burn ISO 2.0"" and it worked fine.

- A DVD-burner....(nothing is too obvious here i found out...)... and DVD-R(this is the safest choice as the xbox-rom has a tendency to be picky) or DVD+R

-------

- Download this game.
- Use WinRar to unpack the .iso file(this is an XISO file).
- Use Qwix101 to extract the files that the XISO file( .iso) contains.
- Delete the ""dashupdate"" file(from the folder that you saved the extracted files in).
- Just delete the original XISO file( .iso) that you unpacked from all the Rar files.
- Make a new XISO( .iso) file from the files that remain after you deleted the ""dashupdate"" file.
- Burn this XISO file( .iso) with a program that can burn .iso files(image files). I use ""Alcohol 120%"" and ""Free Create-Burn ISO 2.0"".
- Use a DVD-R(works in most cases) or DVD+R.

or transfere the whole freeken .iso file to the modded xbox hard drive with Qwix.

Even with this step-by-freeken-small-step-guide i know there is still going to be many questions like ""do i need an xbox to play this"", ""can i use my ipod to hack the world bank"", or ""what time is it"", and for you i can only say.... hang in there - google it - and we will all do our best to try to help you... just hang in there!!! hehe! ;p"
,Pixellius,2008-05-10T00:02Z,"Have the same problem as everyone else, deleted the dashupdate, uploaded to the xbox harddrive. Intro screen shows, blinks away,and reshows, looping constantly. How the heck do we fix this??"
,amagedor,2008-08-03T22:28Z,"Could someone tell me what i further have to do to make this work on Cxbx/Dxbx emulator?

I already have the .xbe, but it won't load."
,jojones88,2008-10-10T00:26Z,"amagedor, are you serious? there is no way in hell this game would be playable on any emulator. i wouldn't be surprised 3 years from now if then it still isnt playable. just stick with emulating consoles older than 8 years..."
,papula96,2008-10-13T23:30Z,"Kan nån seeda, fastnat på 99,9%...pls"

,Kiddy989,2010-11-05T06:45Z,"This is PAL, which is the video game export type that runs of PAL systems. PAL systems generally are found in Europe, Australia, and some parts of Asia. PAL games generally will not run on an American/Canadian console. I can't remember what the American export type is called, and I am also not 100% sure this is correct with X-box."
,zConkerBFDz,2011-01-14T03:43Z,wow. missing part.004.rar. you got to be kidding me its corrupted. does noone else have this problem? i know exactly what to do but i always get corrupted files

,Emparado,2011-01-27T19:35Z,"i just can't get this fucker to work on my xbox 360. it is a BC game but it just will not start.

when downloaded i open it in magic iso and remove the defalt.bak file and then just saving it as a .iso file. after burning it my 360 says something like "" there has been a problem with your xbox original game, go to xbox.com/support for more help.
and also a code
X: 2884.0 B: 1663.0 (the numbers and NOT correct)

well, someone who has played this backup on the 360? someone who might have a idea on how to get it to work?
