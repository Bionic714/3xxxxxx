I agree, here at least in Argentina, it's hard to get hold of acid, not even good but any at all.

,Spinoza1,2005-07-30T12:16Z,"Could it really be possible that we should all be stuck here at 97% all of us.

Would a kind soul please seed this a littel bit more and push us over, please. Pretty please...

,jzenman,2008-11-14T00:57Z,Just a heads up. This video has a little bit of flashing going on. But the audio and video seem to be synchronized. The flashing is not that bad and it's watchable plus you're not going to find it anywhere else on bittorrent and it's free so deal with it.   
,tomasyo,2009-06-22T21:43Z,seed please.. need this video! i'm at 92.2%
,Captain_Planet,2011-01-19T06:54Z,Thanks for continuing to seed this.
