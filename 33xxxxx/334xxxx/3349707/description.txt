Pat Boone was the second most popular singer of the late 50's [behind Elvis Presley] and sold many, many records. His trademark was his white bucks, an unusual style of shoes that became fashionable for a time in the 50's. 
He was born Charles Eugene Boone in 1934 in Jacksonville, Florida, and moved with his family to Tennessee in 1936. He began his professional singing career while a student at North Texas State College. In 1953, while still in his teens, Pat married Shirley Lee Foley, a marriage that has endured to this day. The following year he appeared on Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts and Ted Mack's Amateur Hour, winning both. He signed his first recording contract with Republic Records in 1954.
