+ RELEASE iNFORMATiON +
-----------------------
trik turner formed in 2001 and exploded onto the music scene in 2002 with their
#7 billboard hit "friends and family", (released by rca). in an unprecedented
move, mtv placed two different videos for "friends and family" in heavy rotation
at the same time. the group preformed on the david letterman show, craig
kilborn, and the last call with carson daly. through radio airplay, television,
video support, and constant touring, trik turner's self-titled debut sold over
400,000 albums worldwide. it sold 170,000 albums in the united states, went gold
in japan, and established the band throughout europe. "friends and family"
reached #32 on the billboard's top 100 songs of 2002 chart quite an honor for a
new artist.

two years later trik turner has a new face. charged with a new sound. trik
turner says, "we came to realize that change is the only constant". the band
says, "we are continually moving forward in a positive direction; trik turner
will preserve."
vocalist doug moore states, "everything is a collaboration. we are very proud of
our new material. we can't wait to reach out to the fans that have been
patiently waiting". the band has learned from their adversity and grown into an
unbreakable unit. "through all of the difficulties and struggles, we have
preserved...we won't quit."

the new album is written and trik turner is reloaded. "we can't wait to get back
on the road and play our new material for our fans." the group has toured with
the likes of eminem, pod, puddle of mudd, staind, linkin park, and more.

so, what is the essence of trik turner? everything is in motion; all past
efforts and mentors lead to this one exact moment in time. the time is now. trik
turner will prevail.
