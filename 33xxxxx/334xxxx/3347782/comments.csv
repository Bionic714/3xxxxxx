,atreyu05,2005-06-23T15:05Z,thank you so much.. you cant find this no wheres
,nikoltjev,2005-06-23T15:16Z,"hate to break it to you atreyu05, but it's been available for free at the elder scrolls official website for quite some time ;)

By the way, to play it on a modern computer you need a DOS-emu. I recommend DOSbox."
,nikoltjev,2005-06-24T01:38Z,"Sorry, I lost my service mind yesterday but now it's back! If you want to download this game from the official website, here is the link: http://www.elderscrolls.com/downloads/downloads_games.htm 

On the same page is also a link to the aforementioned DOS-emu."
