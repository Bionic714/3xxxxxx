The band Veda was born in Kansas City, Missouri during the
spring of 2004. The rock quartet started with Brian Little and
Kristen May playing in a previous band together for about a
year. With Kristen's unique powerful vocals and Brian's
inventive ambient guitar riffs, Veda began. Soon came Jason
Douglas on bass and Drew Little on drums and Veda was
complete. The musical influences of the band collectively are
the Joy Division, the Foo Fighters, A Perfect Circle, Bjork
and Coldplay. Veda emerged on the scene playing with local
bands in Missouri and Kansas as well as opening for mainstream
touring acts bringing their music to a wide variety of
audiences. In the summer of 2004, Veda collaborated with Ed
Rose at Black Lodge to record their first six song e.p. Though
this band is new to the scene, they win fans over with their
live rock show. This dynamic show is what has caused quite a
buzz about this young band. With mature lyrics, beautiful
melodies, a tight rhythm section, and a strong work ethic, the
future is looking bright for Veda.
