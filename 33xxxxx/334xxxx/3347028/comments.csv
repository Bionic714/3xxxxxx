,Peter0703,2005-06-21T15:12Z,Any ideas for covers?
,dewytakm,2005-06-22T15:45Z,The covers are contained in the MP3 files for all albums.  It is also easy to find them on the internet.
,dewytakm,2005-06-22T15:46Z,"I should have provided a better description for those who don't know what PPM means.  These albums are Peter, Paul and Mary from the 1960's and on."
