,fiskepind,2008-09-13T21:43Z,yes i'd also like to know how to unrar the file???
,BitGod,2008-10-30T05:15Z,"drbast and fiskepind, unfortunately you wont be able to unrar the file as it contains encrypted code that prevents the file being unrared by leechers with IQs less than 70.
 Sorry about that but if you can increase your intelligence you can try again next week. 

 As a bonus offer though I have a bridge for sale if you are interested........"
