Return to forever, featuring Chick Corea - Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy
Personnel: Chick Corea (acoustic & electric pianos, organ, harpsichord, gong); Bill Connors (acoustic & electric guitars); Stanley Clarke (electric bass, bell tree); Lenny White (drums, bongos, congas, percussion). Recorded in August 1973. Digitally remastered by Joseph M. Palmaccio. HYMN OF THE 7TH GALAXY, its hyper speed momentum aside, shares many of the characteristics of prog rock: flashy playing, incredibly complex instrumental passages and arrangements, awry and tangled time signatures, and a propensity towards raw energy intermingled with electronics. Everyone here plays as if there were no tomorrow. Chick Corea's supercharged electric piano and organ licks alternate between fire-breathing tone clusters and atmospheric grace. Guitarist Bill Connors plays like a comet circling a supernova; Stanley Clarke's earthquake-inducing bass lines are both monstrous and finger-poppin' funky, while drummer Lenny White simply beats his kit to jelly. Feel the power: the protoplasmic funk of "After the Cosmic Rain," the Fender Rhodes symphonies and ecstatic drumming of "Captain Senor Mouse," the far-out space-bop of the title track. Super hot stuff from one of jazz-rock's cornerstones
