This is not the Paramount/Speilberg version. This is a DVD release of an indie (low budget) retelling of the classic book by HG Wells. The acting is decent; something different. Story is great ofcourse. Graphics.. well.. I could have made better graphics with toothpics, glue, and a broken lampshade. Hell the Jeff Wayne PC game had better CG animation.

Either way, worth watching at least once. I'll probably watch it several times. Also worth checking out the awesome flash driven website!
