,psittack,2005-06-29T00:14Z,"awesome post - big fan of war of the worlds & been eager to see this movie for a while.

probably a lot better than the speilberg version if you can get past the low budget!"
,squishsquash,2005-06-29T00:48Z,"
 Tom cruise made me laugh when he said""oh steven speilberg doesnt half write a good movie"" and i thought well what the hell did H.G wells write then lol!!

 stupid fucking yanks they have to remake every film thats ever made, doesnt it just do your head in lol

 good upload
 thx :)"
,prot11,2005-06-29T00:59Z,better than speilberg version? uh.. on what grounds? time will tell.
,squishsquash,2005-06-29T01:15Z,"
 On the grounds that speilberg didnt write it in the first place

 nor king kong
"
,prot11,2005-06-29T01:49Z,"so  yea, pendragon didn't write this story either etc."
,Portishead,2005-06-29T04:38Z,"Sounds intressting, at first I thought this would be the war of the world movie from 1953 but then again this one sound intressting.
(and yes the one from 1953 is good and has a superb soundtrack :)"
,warlock847,2005-06-29T06:58Z,thankyou
,amontoth,2005-06-29T12:47Z,"Thanks ...been looking for this one, imho the best of the 3 for the simple reason it is NOT a ""retelling"" or a ""reimagining"" but actually based on the novel.
rant mode on
I am sick of these friggen amerikan movies that relocate time and place to usa today, or rewrite history just to pander to rednecks dreams of glory.
rant mode off

:) have a nice day!"
,gufodotto,2005-06-29T14:27Z,"thanks mate, was looking for this one... but I'll watch spielberg, too.."
,jte3,2005-06-29T14:46Z,just watched the trailer for this. looks great. many thanks to prot11 for sharing this.
,thegoonden,2005-06-29T18:33Z,and no to the smart fuck....pendragon didn;t write this...I'll say this really slow so u can get it....HERBERT GEORGE WELLS WROTE THS IN 1898 pendragon made that....cruise made some other movie and stole the name
,sys64738,2005-06-29T21:10Z,Ingen som har den nya filmen att ladda upp än?
,Rodmund1,2005-06-30T00:17Z,Not worth downloading.
,thegoonden,2005-06-30T01:00Z,"Listen, if you really ar totally hellbent on watching the Cruise/Spielberg movie, you MUST, you OWE it to yourself to either watch this ( however bad it may be made) or at least read the book ( or listen to the audio book) Honestly, the Cruise version is just a totally different story with the wotw name tagged on. the messages of the book are even more important to humanity now than they were in 1898 and you can BET they will not be so much as sniffed at in the new one because they go against what the west currrently stands for. Yes folks WE ARE THE MARTIANS!  By all means watch mr cruise's story about how to be a good dad, but do ot insult the memory of the man who singlehandedly invented 80% of sci fi, by accepting anything other than HIS story as being WotW.....there is a very good reason it's till a best seller 100+ years on, a good reason why star trek and star wars and Dr Who and V and battlestar are all just sad rip offs of his work. He IS the granddaddy along with Jules Verne (ever hear a shuttle crew mention vernier(RCS) thrusters?....guess who?). Cruise will make a fine movie. He will not make wotw. do not sell yourself short, find out why a story can last 100 years ( after all the movie version only lasted 50 before it got redone)"
,johnny_cash,2005-06-30T02:21Z,"thegoonden: I'm glad there are still some good people around here.
I just HATE what the kiddy fucking rapists did to the time machine, it's an insult."
[T],Knaster,2005-06-30T17:52Z,well prot11 why didnt u record it with camer for the rest of us ppl :-) 8)
,prot11,2005-06-30T21:59Z,iduno pry cuz i hav 2 lern 2 wriyt englisk firzt lol afk 
,squishsquash,2005-06-30T23:49Z,"
 Like thegoonden said HG WELLS wrote this and he wrote it with a passion,the original film had soul  , i havent seen the new film yet but im sure theres more special effects than sainsburys!
 i think the yanks are going over the top with remakes, i mean look at the italian job, the original was just so clever and witty, but no they had to remake it .

Even starwars has been soon forgotten and another film about batman lol oh plz
give me alex guiness in his early films anyday
 no effects just proper acting !!!

 i really and honstly think they have ran out of ideas

 lol."
,tk_god,2005-07-01T01:33Z,är den från 2005
,vill_tanka,2005-07-01T10:53Z,"tror jag väntar tills den ""äkta"" kommer up med bra kvalitét.."
,thegoonden,2005-07-01T13:38Z,"sad isn't it that a 170page book confuses the geatest minds in hollywood. Anyway, e all know the book is really about britain's dominance and cruelty in lesser countrie, about slavery exploitation and empire building, do you really think the Spielberg one is going to aim all those things at his happy clappy us audience as well as his martians
Oh....BTW...I hear the end of the spielberg one is nauseating....please GOD don't let the little wretch have changed it so the USAF beat the martians with bombs of apple pie and freedom"
,atarilover,2005-07-05T12:05Z,"BRITAIN IS GREAT!
BRITAIN IS GREAT!
LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!"
,divac,2005-07-06T06:52Z,"ah, so this is the timothy hines version ? that one was produced by pendragon... 'cause then you have provided the wrong imdb link ;-) should be http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425638/"
[V],catflap,2005-07-06T16:00Z,"yes, thi is NOT the c. thomas howell version as your imdb link is WRONG!

don't you even check your own files before you upload them?

idiot."
