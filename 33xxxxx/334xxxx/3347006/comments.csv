,gregorius,2005-07-01T00:35Z,"how can this widely be ignored? how is it possible that in the last 20 years nobody talks about or even knows about it? it was in all media some 25 years ago, for about 2 weeks and as soon as 'dad & son' appeared claiming they had done all the circles, all over the world, more than 1000 and always in one night, an so for 25 years now...just for fun...strange, very strange!"
