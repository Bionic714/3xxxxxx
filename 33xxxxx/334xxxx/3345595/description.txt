Pearl Harbor: Zero Hour begins with a fully rendered, real-time

  re-enactment of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, including the sinking

  of the U.S.S. Arizona. Then, it's payback time. Choose from 14 aircraft,

  including famous planes such as the Corsair, P-51 Mustang and B-25 bomber.

  You'll dogfight, dive-bomb and torpedo the Japanese forces in 10 missions

  all drawn from the Pacific campaign battles of World War II, including

  Guadalcanal, The Battle of Midway, and Okinawa.

  

  "Yeah, Moe, that team sure did suck last night. They just plain sucked!

   I've seen teams suck before, but they were the suckiest bunch of sucks that

   ever sucked." -Homer Simpson
