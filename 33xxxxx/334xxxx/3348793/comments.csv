But please seed more."
,lihsa,2006-05-21T17:49Z,This looks great- could somebody please seed this? 
,autumn.cannibalism,2006-07-03T02:54Z,This continued to error on my computer. I don't know if it is my system or if the file is corrupt. 
,godai00,2006-07-11T15:23Z,"Instructions are to burn a CD but main file is a ZIP file which, when extracted, gives files that look like an installed program, not an iso. When the exe is run, I get a video card error."
,Bacchus78,2006-08-06T21:08Z,99.8% please seed
,MsRed,2008-01-27T15:36Z,"I couldn't get it to work either. Error message.
Unless someone comes up with a solution, this is not worth downloading. :("
,Balleschmidt,2008-07-18T14:27Z,SEED ? =)
,BitMistress,2009-02-02T14:37Z,"Thank you so much kitaeca! I like this game so much I bought it twice (and also lost it twice).  It was never entirely compatible with my pc, it would sometimes crash. To my surprise this torrent works much smoother and launches without a cd.  It's already installed, so just move the entire folder into your ""Program Files"" and create a shortcut of the .exe file on your desktop.  Voila! "
,Sarrina,2009-07-09T07:11Z,SEED?! =) Please :p

,crossmr,2010-02-10T17:42Z,Anyone know where I can find the updated version of this from last year called PC Fitness: Your personal trainer?
,slawpol,2011-02-15T22:40Z,"It works perfect on XP. Worth 100% , I,m looking for additional levels. "
,YusufAD,2011-04-25T22:58Z,"@crossmr, and anyone that also went into a wild goose chase after his comment: ""PC Fitness: Your personal trainer"" is the same as this, just re-branded for the UK, as I eventually found out in the note in the reviews section of their website (http://www.pcfitness.co.uk/reviews.html): ""these reviews refer to the US version of this software, entitled Yourself! Fitness"". "
