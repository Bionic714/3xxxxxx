Although I respect everyone's point of view, I have to totally disagree with the reviewer below me who stated that the music on this CD is annoyingly repetitive. Believe me, I listen to regular pop music and I myself get very frustrated at how annoying and repetitve most of techno music is. Yes, Juno Reactor may often use similar beat, but the complex sampling and melodies change constantly, so the album never gets boring. Instead, many songs have a tremendous amount of energy. Slower tracks such as 5,7,8 expertly combine trance, fast beats, and dreamy melodies. Listening to this CD you feel transported to some dark exciting futuristic world. I love it. Better than Bible of Dreams which, by the way, is another great CD.
