,giancian,2005-06-19T02:20Z,No problem! Nice to know it worked fine!
,dede.lodz,2005-06-24T17:24Z,Works great!!!! Had some problems witch connecting E398 but now it works... GREAT torrent!!!
,Micke_2000,2005-07-03T00:34Z,You rock giancian :D I havent downloaded it yet but.. I am just surprised.. how do you get the java applications to the phone? That has been a problem for me before. Cheers! /Micke
,giancian,2005-07-04T18:53Z,"The easiest way to install apps to the E398 is by bluetooth. You right click on the JAR file and select SEND TO>BLUETOOTH DEVICE. 
If you don't have blutooth in your computer, the process is way more complicated, i suggest you read a tutorial such as this one:

because the process involves activating the java loader on your phone and using a PC program called Midway or P2Kman.
(I suggest getting a USB bluetooth dongle for your PC! =o)"
