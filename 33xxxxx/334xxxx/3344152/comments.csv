,Wolaten,2005-06-13T21:09Z,hmm dum fråga men kan man instalera denna på en pc? =D
,Tierleben,2005-06-13T22:11Z,"Wolaten: Nej det kan man inte. Men Apple ska ju gå över till Intel-processorer under de närmaste åren, så det kanske kommer en PC-version med tiden...

Tank you so much, CandTsmac :)"
,fjerkon,2005-06-14T08:36Z,"nej
men skulle inte förvåna mig om intel-versionen av osx kommer ploppa upp här snart. det skulle vara kul att testa. dom har ju utvecklat osx parallelt för x86 och ppc i fem år så det borde vara en helt okej upplevelse =)"
,fjerkon,2005-06-14T08:36Z,"allså svar på ""hmm dum fråga men kan man instalera denna på en pc? =D"""
,Tierleben,2005-06-14T14:10Z,[CandTsmac:] I'm downloading at approximately the rates you're seeding.
,oblikon,2005-06-14T21:20Z,[CandTsmac] I'm downloading at approx those rates too.  Thanks very much for the release!
,dixy,2005-06-15T13:20Z,"Is this the intel version? Please, let me know. Thanks!"
,CandTsmac,2005-06-15T16:50Z,Sorry. This is not the Intel version. I Think I'll be able to get it in a week or two. I'll post it if and when I do.
,hnn,2005-06-15T18:33Z,Is it DMG files or ISO/Cue?
,karotechia,2005-06-15T22:33Z,"[CandTsmac] Dude ... this release R O C K S ! ! !  Super thanks for posting this ... a great help for those older iBooks and iMacs with no DVD drive.  To answer [hnn]'s question, these are pure .dmg files - you can burn them from the OSX Disk Utility with ease.  I am currently seeding at a steady 20 kb/s right now."
,bonky,2005-06-15T23:05Z,"Please excuse my naivity - I'm new to all this but don't we need an serail no/code to input when we try you use the installer for the first time? Where do we get these from (Serial box doesn't appear to have it)?

Thanks"
,karotechia,2005-06-16T00:43Z,"[bonky] No serial number or activation code is necessary.  This is Apple, not Micro$loth.  You will arrive at a point where you are asked to register.  To skip this step (recommended) just press Command-Q (a.k.a. the open apple or cloverleaf key + the Q-key).  Just choose the SKIP option, and you will go forward to the account creation screen."
,karotechia,2005-06-16T00:55Z,"[CandTsmac & dixy] Apple has stated that it would prevent users from installing OS X on non-Mac hardware.  In other words, you will have to have Mac-Intel hardware in order to run OSXi when it is released (most likely in 2006).  Apple is still a hardware company, and it would make no sense for them to release a version of OSX that runs on standard Intel/AMD hardware right now, even though it is possible.  For more see this article: http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2137787/security-chip-block-non-macs"
,karotechia,2005-06-16T05:49Z,That will be sweet.  I will definately give it a try! Thanks.
,blackphiber,2005-06-16T09:33Z,"sorry for my poor grammar in the earlier post,  I just wanted to ask one more thing, could you please tell us here when/if you release it?  and in my previous post when I say x86 I am reffering to standard x86 hardware.  Thank you."
,inspire97,2005-06-16T11:28Z,"Looking forward to the x86 Tiger :-)

In the long run, I think it will finally force Micro$oft to improve. In the end, the consumer wins. "
,mammorna,2005-06-16T14:37Z,"How do I burn these images on a PC; my Mac lacks on the burner side.
 I’ve tested to convert the dmg-files to iso-files on my mac using disk utilities, and by using Ultraiso on the windows machine. But the boot record disappears in both ways.

,ayejoel,2005-06-16T20:37Z,Install will not start from burned disks. If anyone had success with installing this torrent please give me a step by step of how to burn and install. Thanks in advance.
,dibbuk,2005-06-16T23:21Z,"This is an 'all-language-version', right?
I'm looking for the Tiger in Swedish."
,karotechia,2005-06-16T23:54Z,"To burn these images to CD-R the correct way on an older version of Mac OS X, do the following on your Apple machine:

1) Go to Applications folder and open the Utilities folder
2) Choose Disk Utility
3) After Disk Utility launches, choose Images on the menu bar and then Burn
4) Point the finder to the Mac OSX 10.4 .DMG image file and click Open
5) Choose Burn"
,Pyth0n,2005-06-17T05:48Z,CandTsmac can´t wait to get my hands on that x86 Tiger? When are you going to upload it?
,CandTsmac,2005-06-17T18:31Z,"If you don't have a burner to the Partition thing. Get iPartition, Make your 1 partition into 5. one big one, the others for the tiger cd's. Then do image restore from disk utility. And your mac will boot from the Partitions like they were cd's. This is easier with the DVD image of tiger. Only one partition to make. The Dev tools cd is missing here I will upload in a day or two. The intell version is almost complete. 3-5 days I would say."
,CandTsmac,2005-06-17T18:31Z,"It should read. If you dont have a burner, do the partition thing. Sorry."
,Pyth0n,2005-06-17T18:35Z,Thanks!! Can you say if this version only works on Intel chipsets ou maybe some nforce2? As the processor required I guess it works with any x86 AMD or Intel right?
,inspire97,2005-06-17T23:08Z,"Python:

This is NOT the x86 version. Its not released yet, we are still waiting. "
,dibbuk,2005-06-17T23:41Z,Of course it's just as multi lingual as every other version. Thanks. It's great!!
,Pyth0n,2005-06-18T01:26Z,"I know that inspire97.
I was talking about the to be posted x86 version."
,CandTsmac,2005-06-19T01:05Z,"At the moment I'm not sure about the hardware, Only saw it once. My buddy with the dev kit is comming over next week. He will tell me all about it then. I think he will be ready for me to release a copy then. I hope. Let you all know soon. One thing I know for sure is it's all intel inside (as much as can be)."
,inspire97,2005-06-21T03:49Z,"Excellent, please keep us posted!"
,Pyth0n,2005-06-21T19:04Z,CandTsmac did you get the x86 version already? Is the key easy to remove? If you need any help I can help you. Also I have some good scene budies that can give a hand on that. Just can´t wait for that torrent file. I´m a PC user but a Mac lover for long time.
,Cuthbert,2005-06-22T07:11Z,"Sorry for the noob question, but will this install format your harddrive? I've never done a mac OS install before you see....

Also: CandTsmac, really looking forward to that x86 release, might be giving that a try on my desktop! Nice work :)"
,JatMan,2005-06-24T13:36Z,Can someone seed please? Everyone is stuck at 48%. Thanks
,loulavander,2005-06-25T02:29Z,"Can anyone please confirm this?
Are the disks really incomplete?
Anyone successfully instaled it?
What's your system config ZashManson?"
,loulavander,2005-06-25T03:43Z,"Hi, I'm back to do my own confirm.
Just installed and it runs absolutely fine.
In fact, I'm just wrinting this in Safari 2.0 on Tiger. I think ZashManson just make something wrong."
,Tierleben,2005-06-25T19:22Z,"[ZashManson:] There's nothing wrong with this torrent, as far as I can tell. I burned the disc images using Disc Utility (sv. Skivverktyg) and it installed on my G4 733 Quicksilver without any problems; no signs at all of the discs being incomplete. By the way, I installed after booting the system from CD 1. Perhaps something went wrong with your download or maybe there's some kind of compatibility issue with the installer and  your PowerBook.

[Cuthbert:] It won't format your harddrive  unless you tell it to. Make sure you choose the right option in the installer. If you already have a version of Mac OS X installed on your harddrive it will, by default, upgrade without touching your other files."
,bjellerup,2005-06-25T22:40Z,"There's absolutely nothing wrong with this torrent. I'm just surprised how anyone can screw this up? You download the files, go to the Disc Utilities, burn the four .dmg files, put the first CD into the drive and press Install. Simple as that. "
,loulavander,2005-06-26T03:33Z,"It's really sad to have someone with so bad manners like ZashManson among us.
And, by the way, the torrent he is point out is for the GM, not retail version. And there is a lot difference between the two. One of them is that one cannot upgrade to 10.4.1 with the GM installed.
Thank you CandTsmac. You did the right thing."
,felz,2005-06-27T00:54Z,how's the speed for people downloading this?

I held ctrl-c during startup and still boots to my 10.3 desktop.

thank you."
,felz,2005-06-27T23:46Z,"is the file a .dmg or .iso?
You should burn it as a CD image."
,felz,2005-06-28T02:40Z,"Does your mac read the CDs and show them in the desktop?

Tried holding down ""C"" when booting with the CD inside?"
,defy god,2005-06-28T02:46Z,"yup, the mac recognizes the CDs.  i've tried holding C down.  i've also tried option, which lets me choose which disk to boot from.  with the 10.3 CD, holding down C worked just fine.  when i held down option with 10.3, it showed the hard drive and the 10.3 install disk.  when i tried it with the 10.4 disks i've just burned, they don't show up.  i've even tried forcing the mac to use it as a start-up disk via the system preferences.  still no go."
,felz,2005-06-28T02:56Z,Maybe its related to the format of the disc? I have no clue. I know some CDs can be burned to work on mac/pc and some pc or mac only...

,felz,2005-06-30T06:49Z,Well when you unzip it you get 2 .dmg files that you would normally burn as a cd image. I will try to find a program to let you make them .iso's that nero can burn.

,merciscool,2005-07-09T04:25Z,"This is for everyone who doesn't have a clue what to do once your download has finished.

1) Unzip the file you downloaded. It will contain four .DMGs which are install CDs 1-4

2) Depending on what OS you're using, you need to open Disk Utility OR Disk Copy. For any OSX Version previous to Panther, you need to open Disk Copy from your Applications, Utilities folder.

3) a)If you're running panther or newer, you need to choose the IMAGES menu in disk utility, and then choose BURN from that drop down menu. You then Choose the one of the 4 .DMG files that you downloaded and burn each seperately.

b) If you're using an OSX prior to Panther, choose the Application Disk Copy and then under the FILE dropdown menu, choose BURN IMAGE. Once again, it will allow you to choose a .dmg file, so select one of the four that unzipped from your download and then burn each disk seperately.

4) Once you have all of the Cds burned, insert Install CD1 into your CD Drive and restart your computer while holding down the C key, to start up from the Installation CD. It's as easy as that.

,analogue,2005-07-10T20:09Z,"Great release, clone of the legit version."
,SirAncestor,2005-07-11T09:16Z,"Done with download and those .DMG's really look legit and when I burn them they are fine and my Mac reads them perfectly, but I still cannot boot from them. Anybody has any suggestion.

BTW--For all those who want to burn those or other Mac images on PC:

Daemon Tools for WinXP [http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/portal/index.php] can mount .dmg without problem. When you mount it you will not be able to read them though. 

Reading can be done on PC with a tool like MacDrive 6 [http://www.mediafour.com/]. 

Isobuster is a WinXP program that can mount any image you imagine, including .dmg [http://www.isobuster.com/]

When you mount .dmg image with Daemon Tools it will look as if it is a CD (DVD) in your virtural drive and you can burn it with CloneCD or Nero or whatever, just say you want to copy the whole CD on your burner."
,fubar2112,2005-07-13T00:12Z,"DOES NOT WORK WITH TOAST... as everyone has said, use Disk Image. I tried using Toast, since I use that for all my burning, and for some reason burning the dmg through toast (yes, I did it properly, and am on Toast 6.1.1) is not bootable.

,ciprianc,2005-07-18T10:56Z,In order for this to work you must burn the images with Disk Utility and not with toast or other burning utility.I've first burned them with toast and the cd wouldn't boot but after i made them with Disk Utility they worked fine.

also, i've read on some other places that people have had success with toast in burning bootable discs. no ideas?"

1)  After you choose which disk to install the copy on, in that proceeding menu choose Customize.
2)  Uncheck the Additional Printer drivers, Additional Language Drivers and basically anything that is not required for the installation.

Doing that will cut the disks needed for install from 1, 2, 3 and 4 to only 1 & 2.  You will still be able to open disk 3 and 4 after installation and install the stuff you need, however, the Epson drivers I know are corrupt so you won't be able to install those.  Hope this helps some having problems."

,campbellnz,2006-09-30T09:50Z,"This is for all the PC guys out there trying to get these files to burn on a CD that will work for your MAC.

The CD1 will not boot up in a MAC. You will have to download an ISO version of the CD1 from this torrent http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3370209

After you have replaced your original CD1 with the new ISO version you will need to get DAEMON Tools to mount the ISO as a virtual CD. When you have done this you can use Nero copy CD option to copy your new virtual CD to a blank CD. Your MAC will now boot form the CD you created.

The other DMG files will also need to be converted to ISO files before you can mount them as virtual CDs and copied with Nero to your blank CDs.

I used dmgextractor.jar which can be downloaded from http://hem.bredband.net/unsound/dmgx/ and is freeware.

I tried everything else as suggested by others here and this was the only method that worked for me.

Enjoy!!!

I keep getting an error though after the Tiger installer completes the disk verification toward the beginning of the process, and it says the installation could not be completed. Anyone else have this problem?"
,anechoica,2007-02-04T18:59Z,"So three days later I finally got this crap installed. 

First off, I couldn't get the discs to boot until I used DiskWarrior to repair the drive; (I booted it from CD.) -It can be found somewhere on TPB, just do a search.

Second, it wouldn't load disc four, nomatter what I tried. Apparently it was corrupt, and I couldn't access my OS to reburn it because I was stuck with half of Tiger installed and it kept returning to a screen telling me to insert disc 2 every time I restarted. I tried burning several discs with several different methods on an XP machine and all but one were junk. The one that did ""work"" just made my mac restart. (wtf?) 

Anyway, my only option when it kept asking for discs 2-4 was to restart my mac, hold down ""option"" and tell it to boot from CD, and start the installation process over from disc one. I had to uncheck the ""extra fonts"" BS and the ""printer drivers"" to get it to ignore discs 3 and four. (Why the hell do I need 600mb of fonts??)


So here's what I learned:

~ My mac would only boot the install CD's after using DiskWarrior on the drive. Make sure to boot DW from it's own CD first.

Just to be safe, I indexed the drive and repaired permissions with disc utility as well.

~ Uncheck 'fonts' and 'printer drivers' under the 'customize' option in the installer.

~ If you forget to uncheck the extra garbage and get stuck in a cycle telling you to insert discs 2-4, restart and hold down 'option' to boot from CD and start over.

You should only need CD's 1 and 2 for a successful install.

Now that it's finally done, everything works great! "

it was so fucking easy!
just download them.
open disc utility
click the .dmg file and burn them, one by one (I only did the first three because that was all i needed)
restart your computer and hold down ""alt"" (option)
then you get some proposals of start up discs if you cannot see your disc insert it and eject it a couple of times until it appears.
choose disc osx 10.4 when you see it and follow instructions!!!

works great on my powerbook G4!!!
love the dashboard!

take care

UltraISO                         (only 4.99mb)

2. Older Macs like this B&W G3 will only read disks burned for Mac hardware.   
3. To get it to load I had to swap out the Apple cd/rom reader for one from an old Dell PC, zap the pram, do reset-all, hold the ""c"" key on restart, and voila, an hour later I have a fully functioning Mac running Tiger OS X.   
4. Once the OS is loaded and functioning you can shutdown and reconnect your original Apple cd/rom hardware.

Ok people who are using windows to get this to work. Here's how I've just managed to 

get it to work. Apparently if you're working with a Mac of some description, then 

it's slightly different method used (I'm using Xp home). I tried following Kustavs 

comment, but using windows to make isos via windows programs didn't work for me 

(plus a lot of google research). And also 2 different tiger cd torrent downloads, 

lots of down time and about a dozen cd-r's later, I've sussed it. 
I've just put it on a G3 imac, and it's working.

No booting from an ipod, or external hard drive needed.

The torrent does work (with some implementation)

First download torrent, and scroll/read Kustavs comment.
2. Click the link there for the 1st tiger cd and download that. It's already been 

iso'd, so just needs to be burned to cd. This can be burned via a windows program 

though. I used Active Iso Burner. And it's free. Read the install there and it says 

that while it works (the first cd), it fails the disc check at the end of 

installation. That's fine, but i'll get to that in a bit.

3. Ok with the 1st cd burnded from Kustavs link, you're ready for the next stage. 

Which is burning the other 3 cds to disc. You can't use a normal windows iso burner 

to do this. This is because the files are mac files ending in .dmg. And a normal 

windows iso burner does not do the job here. (trust me, cost me about 8 cds of 

trying different strokes). So after a lot of research, what you need is TRANSMAC. 

This is not free, but it's here on this site, with nessary bonuses (which works). 

Here below is the url for you to take a look and make your own mind up.

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4217944/Acute.Systems.TransMac.8.1.Cracked-RAZUM.7z

So download this, read it (a bit confusing). Once Transmac is working, basically 

click on tools tab and choose burn cd. Locate the 2nd tiger mac file ending .dmg and 

just click to burn. It doesn't need to be burned at all into an Iso. Your mac 

computer should automatically just read the cd when placed (researched it on net).
Repeat these steps for .dmg file 3 and 4.

Make sure you burn with low speed. (don't take much longer)

4. Once you have all 4 cds, you're ready. So power the mac up, get the first disc 

and restart. Pressing key C for me to boot the cd. Like Kustav link states ""the disc 

fails the disc check at the end"". Don' t panic, just click Ignor/carry on, or 

whatever the tab states. And when prompted, insert disc 2/3/and 4.

And that's it people. I've bothered to add this comment as there's too many 

conflicting advise and bad torrents. I'm no expert here, so if it doesn't work for 

you, it's not my fault. But what i've listed has just worked on an old iMac G3. And 

as the torrent lists that it's the retail version (and not specifically for a 

macbook or power mac or whatever) then you should be in luck.

Thanks to all those who provide great torrents (and there bonuses), and remember 

people KEEP SEEDING.

Seed this torrent as there's not many of these Tiger mothers about anymore.

Good luck

Hobbs"
,xcrimsonprophecyx,2008-07-04T02:51Z,For anyone reading this.... I will try HOBBS instructions and get back on and report if it works on my powerbook g4. Im hoping like hell it does cause I have the ohhh so out of date os x 10.2 right now.
,xcrimsonprophecyx,2008-07-04T23:09Z,"Well I couldn't get the first cd to work. - the one that starts as an iso. That and my damn powerbook won't boot to the optical drive using the C key at startup. And ctrl doesn't read the cd either. I know no-one will care to help, but I figured I would just say that my mac us fucked up too."
,xcrimsonprophecyx,2008-07-09T09:36Z,"Hmmm.. Third post. Since my last post I have finally gotten this OS to work. My suggestion is follow Hobbs advice. It works. I have tiger on my powerbook g4 right now thanks to that post. Thanks hobbs. As well as Kustav. A little more advice is when you go to install, if it doesn't work right away the first time, keep trying different combinations of the custom install. You know when you pick the drive you will be installing on. On mine I needed to UNCHECK the printer drivers. I think that part of the iso is corrupt or something. But unchecking that wont affect anything anyway. 

You should only end up having to use the first 3 disks as well. So with that advice, I hope to save you a CD-R. :) Just try it the first time with only discs 1-3 and then checking the box for the print drivers OFF. There might have also been another on I didnt' install. Keep the language one. I think may need that. 

But you have to follow Hobbs instructions EXACTLY!! You absolutely have to use active iso burner to burn your .iso file. I tried both power ISO and Ultra ISO to burn. Lol. Im dumb. So I hope this helps somewhat cuz I can tell you that I have had a hell of a time trying to install this thing. lol. 

For everyone having trouble with the C auto boot from cd thing. Just try it a few times it works. Just hold the C button down once you get your load screen and it should boot. Also try tapping it from the black screen start up or holding it down the second your pc restart or turns on. Just keep it down. It really should load up for you. Cool? Good.

And as always remember to SEED. This torrent is really good because the files work, and because the directions and help on this page are the best I think. and I can tell you that it does work if you take the time to download all these files.

Your checklist.
Programs and files needed:
ACTIVE ISO BURNER.
TRANSMAC.
ISO DISC 1. (From Kustav's Post.)
THE TORRENT ON THIS PAGE. (discs 2-3, your choice on whether or not to use disc 4)
Those can all be gotten on TPB.

Hope this helps. Remember to SEED if you can.

Peace.

thanks!!"
,aurifex,2008-09-30T01:25Z,"I got this working without needing to download anything else. Here is what I did.

1: Downloaded the torrent to my computer that runs Windows.

2: Once done, I copied all of the DMG image files to my iMac. (You can use CDs / DVD / or a USB drive)

3: Used Disk Copy in the Applications folder to burn each image to a CD.

4: After all burns were finished, I inserted CD 1, restarted the computer, and held down the ""C"" key until the CD loaded.

5: I chose a clean install, and stripped down the install to just the needed files. (The only selection during the install that's greyed out and unable to uncheck)

--------------------------------

I have no tried any other methods, like converting and burning the DMG files from within Windows itself. I did not try to install the extra font packages and printer drivers, nor the X11 tools.

I currently have Mac OS 10.4.10 running on an old G3 iMac 600MHz, with 512MB RAM, CD-RW drive (non-DVD), and a 40GB hard drive.

I suggest grabbing these downloads as well, they are free and will greatly enhance your copy of OS X.

10.4.9 Update: http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/macosx1049comboupdateppc.html
(Can update any 10.4.x version)

10.4.10 Update: http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/macosx10410updateppc.html
(Requires the 10.4.9 update installed)

QuickTime 7.7.5: http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/quicktime755fortiger.html
(iTunes 8 requires this updated version)

iTunes 8: https://swdlp.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/SoftwareDownloadApp.woa/wa/getProductData?localang=en_us&grp_code=itunes&returnURL=http://www.apple.com/itunes/download&isMiniiFrameReq=N&showMac=true

I recommend installing those updates in order, otherwise you'll run into errors and demands that you upgrade your system.

My scenario: Used this torrent to successfully upgrade from 10.3 to 10.4 on G4 PPC iBook 933mhz.  This torrent is not compatible with Intel Macs.

My first run that did not work: Downloaded and burned each .dmg to a separate CD using Finder at 1x.  I used Imation CD's.  This version didn't work; everything looked good, but my Mac simply wouldn't boot from the disk.  I don't think the brand had anything to do with it; I think the critical error was that I used Finder.

My second run that did work: Burned each .dmg to a separate CD using Disk Utility at 8x.  I used Memorex discs this time (I read a small blurb somewhere about Imation not being a Mac's favorite discs, but I don't know anything for sure).  The second set of CD's created were bootable and worked perfectly.  I have no clue what DU does on a burn that Finder won't, but I think you have to use DU (or disk copy in 10.2).

As instructed on this forum, I unchecked printer drivers, extra fonts, and extra languages when doing my install.  

iBook appears to be working fine."

I think your problem is that you are trying to install the OS on your hard drive, but the installer you're running is also saved on that SAME hard drive.

You need to burn the dmg's to CD (see the previous page of this post for a great how to from another guy).

When you insert the burned CD, run the installer and it will bring up the same installer window you're talking about.  Except now, when you click restart, it will boot from the CD drive.  Presto."

My first attempts at completing the Installer did not work. After finishing disc 1, the box would reset but then hang with a (\) icon. Bad. Had to reboot using ""c"" and restart Installer from scratch.

Finally, I changed some of the settings within the Installer (Options and Customize - respectively) to do a ""complete"" install and blow away everything (opposed to an upgrade), and I was able to install with all additional options including X11 which I really need!!!

Everyone else: This downloaded pretty quick for me, installed BEAUTIFULLY on my iMac G4.  I think CD burning is still much more reliable than DVD burning, so this is much better than the other (DVD) version of 10.4. Thanx!!!!

,NutMagnet,2010-01-01T20:41Z,Disk 2 failed to install.... Luckily i installed this first time on a spare HD as it would have totally wasted my system.. DO NOT RELY ON DISK VERIFY as i did everything correct and also followed information on other comments about not installing the printer additions. Back to eBay to try and buy a copy... wasted a whole day trying to get this working and would have been good if it did. No cost so no loss apart from my time..

I did the following:
-Convert disks 2, 3, and 4 from .dmg to .iso using ISOMagic
-Burned to CD-RW's with ImgBurn (1x write speed for minimal chance of a write error)
-Booted using the Startup Manager.  I used the other torrent here (it was mentioned in the comments) for a bootable disk 1, which I also downloaded and burned.  The three from here were great.
Both programs are free (the demo version of ISOMagic works fine for this).

My eMac is alive now.  Thank you :)"

,ffuentes_1,2012-08-29T06:43Z,"I finally installed Tiger using these CDs. At least in Linux, in order to burn these images you'll need AcetoneISO to convert DMG into ISO (using the ""not recommended"" option)

I didn't try the first CD cause it downloaded from other torrent but unless it was corrupted it should boot up using AcetoneISO to convert it."
