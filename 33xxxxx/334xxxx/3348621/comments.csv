,rci,2005-06-26T12:38Z,"all heads of nasa and astronauts are 33째 of freemasonry, all their names and symbols are black magic related, even the flag they put on the moon was a masonic flag, so they created a masonic lodge on the moon and of course the planet is their property. btw illuminati and masons are quiet the same shit, these are reptilian dark puppets controled by satanic hidden forces from the lowest fourth dimension. :("

,Boricua100%,2006-05-31T04:16Z,Freemasons are real people trying their best to be better human beings. They are  charitable persons and better people than the weird religious fanatics that try to doctrinate others with lies and stupid fears to someting they did not know and will never understand.
,Isimund,2006-12-02T05:25Z,"Cheezus. I wish, I truly wish freemasons were all that conspirary buffs believe it to be. I'm a fucking mason and we have trouble agreeing on what to serve for fraternity meal after lodge meetings. To think we're running the show on this planet... Like I said - I wish!

Seriously: Freemasons are a bunch of old fucks who believe that we might make the world a better place to live in if we work on ourselves like if we were chunks of rock, chipping off anything that prevents our interaction with our fellow men and women in society. We mainly try to achieve that by having archaic and bizarre fundraiser meetings after which we pat ourselves on the back for being such nice chaps while sipping expensive liquor. Sure we try to recruit all that excel in any endeavour. Wouldn't you? We're striving to better ourselves and we might learn something about that if we join ranks with those have already proven to be of ""the right stuff"", who have proven their mettle in some way.

Aah, whatever. I'm probably just adding to your preconceptions anyway. I'm drunk as a skunk and fucked up like a pile of coathangers, he he... :)"
,bunnylove9,2008-04-28T21:27Z,"To say that all of the Freemasons are satan worshipers is incorrect, but there are MANY levels within the Freemasons. I believe that this is the level that rci is talking about."
