,gurgel,2005-06-16T03:07Z,How do you get Xcom Defense and TFTD to work in Windows XP? I only get a skewed screen when trying to play.
,avatar1969,2005-06-16T20:48Z,"You have to download a program called DOSBOX, search it with google and you can download a free program..it lets you play old dos games under xp...."
,gurgel,2005-06-17T04:02Z,"Hm, ok. It said in the readme-file that these classics were patched to work under Win95/Win98 (while the originals did not), so I thought it would help running the game in XP using compability-mode, but it didn't.

I'll check dosbox."
,avatar1969,2005-06-17T04:16Z,yeah i know...xp sucks ;) But the x-com games RULEZZZ
,Bloodwright,2005-06-21T13:29Z,"Didn't have any problems getting either Xcom 1 & 2 working on XP, the weird flickering when running the program isn't from XP but from the new video cards we run these days. There is a patch called xcom1fix.exe (for UFO) and xcom2fix.exe (for TotD) on the same CD as these two games. Simply install the patch into the main game directory and run the game from this file. Been having great fun! tops Knumskull! :)"

,Lone_Wolf,2005-07-31T23:11Z,"Can anyone tell me how to install x-com 1 &2? I've got dosbox, but don't know how to run the games. When i unrar x-com i only get 4 files; XCOM APOC.mdf, XCOM APOC.mds, X-COMCEV10.mdf and XCOMCEV10.mds.
Can someone help me, x-com ROCKS and each second without it is an eternity of suffering(!)"
,Lone_Wolf,2005-08-01T16:19Z,"Hey all, i've been seeding this on-and-off for a few days, my upl/dl ratio is now 2.6, but i still can't figure out how to install/play (see my earlier comment). Maybe if any of you downloading it right now get it to work, you can tell me what i'm doing wrong? (i'm totally newbie, probably just missing the obvious)
Tak / thanx"
,ztmluno,2005-08-08T12:00Z,"Lone_Wolf:  XCOM APOC.mdf, XCOM APOC.mds, X-COMCEV10.mdf and XCOMCEV10.mds are image files, burn them or mount them with Alcohol120% or similar program"
