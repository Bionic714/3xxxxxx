[3294]
	- fixed: Forgot to remove some lframe stuff in 3293, this is now completely removed again (should fix reboot 
          issues in evox and xbmc)
	- fixed: Removed vga stuff again, found the problems (YUV instead of RGB) but will be re-added and working fully 
          on ALL Xbox versions shortly - thanks for those who gave feedback on our last build - the results were as expected.
	- notes: MAKE SURE YOU RESET THE X3 TO DEFAULT SETTINGS BEFORE USING - OR SOME THINGS LIKE BOOT FROM DISC WONT WORK
