Game 4 (June 16) of the 2005 NBA Finals from an NHK Japan TV broadcast. Captured using MPEG-2 (NTSC, 720 X 480, 60 Hz, 4:3) and AC3 compression.

 The audio is in English with a smattering of commentary in Japanese.

 Another whopper at nearly 5.4 GB. If you believe "Manu a magician is" and are crazy about "Detroit Defense," then you might wanna download this iso image.

 Enjoy ...
