3. I'll go download some proper releases."
,tmjam2002,2005-07-01T00:28Z,The release works fine bro. The only problem is is your PC. I hav'nt played any missions. I just play skirmish. But I do have tried the Chinese thing you said and it works great no problem. Check your video card drivers

,fattyboywantcake,2010-06-30T00:44Z,"I had tried everything under the sun for 3 days to try and make previous ZH downloads work- registry fixes, new cracks, patches, folder name changes and re-installs. Quiet frankly, they stank ad kept on crashing at start-up - a common situation i can see many people faced with ZH having been through dozens of old forums. There seem to be some bad ZH ISOS out there with very poor instructions and missing patches/registry fixes.

This tmjam2002 install however worked for me quiet easily on windows XP service pack 3. I suppose there is no reason why it should not work for Vista/Windows 7 with compatibility mode to XP.

Simple instructions i would use for the install as follows:

Use ISO burner software to extract the game. When extracted, go into the GENERALS folder and execute C&C Generals+Zero Hour.exe

Let the game install itself in the normal directory - the C drive.

IMPORTANT PART: Once installed, go to Start, Programmes, EA Games, Generals > click through all of the 6 ""reg nycklar"" one by one and add them to your registry. 

Go to C drive, ""Program"" folder, (not the Program Files folder- look
closely you will see there are 2.)

Go to EA Games, Command & Conquer Generals, Zero Hour. Launch
generals.exe from Finewolf. Select Single player offline and enter game.

Make a short cut to the generals.exe (finewolf) where u want.

Chill :)"
