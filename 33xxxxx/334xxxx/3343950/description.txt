Yes this is the game everyone loves to download. I have included both Command and Conquer Generals and Generals Zero hour. Quite a big file, worth the download. It was on suprnova long time ago and also on youceff torrents, till both of them closed down. This time I have included external trackers in this torrent. To help this torrent spread you can use Bit Lord and edit the torrent, you can add more trackers to it. Also Please post this torrent on as many torrent websites as you can. Since this is an ISO file. You can either burn it on a DVD or use a Virtual CD software like Daemon Tools and play it from your hard drive. Don't I repeat don't change the default folders where it asks you to install the games. Otherwise the games don't run. Also after installing click one of the reg files to add the game to windows registry. It will be something like reg 1,2,3 click anyone. Good Luck and enjoy the games. To get Daemon tools go here:
