Well, it have been downloaded already 144 times, so obviously there is sombody that needed this, and wanted to experiment with it. No need to flame the comment section for uplods you dont find usful.

The description also says"" for advanced DOS users only"", so obviously it is not ment for you.

You should rather focus on torrents thats more into your track, than stopping up and flaming those that dont fit your interests."

,HIyaalll,2008-04-10T16:39Z,"O, I can now see that there are some network drivers in the pack.. and not only BNC connected one(phew).. I think that I have a old 3com 10Mbit card somewhere around here.. than it's hockey( and to quote previous post: ""Muahahahaha"")."

Why the fuck do people waste time comment-spamming torrents when all they have to say is a bunch of shit?"
