,n20,2005-06-18T18:40Z,are you still able to update thru the website?
,voodochild,2005-06-18T18:43Z,Yes you can update and it doesnt take much space at all. Since it isnt bloated with a bunch of crap you dont need or even use.
,jmx,2005-06-18T18:52Z,Can you add visual styles (themes) to it when it's installed or is themes not an option at all?
,v-rex,2005-06-18T19:59Z,"Just a tip: anyone installing this thing needs to be very, very careful. A customized operating system downloaded from an anonymous source might contain all sorts of nasty surprises in the form of backdoors and spyware. Do you trust ""voodoochild""? 

And forget about software like Ad-aware and Spybot - they cannot detect some of the nastier stuff out there. I wouldn't install this without comparing each and every file with an original copy of WinXP Pro SP2."
,voodochild,2005-06-18T20:13Z,Dude I can tell you right now it has no such things on here. I am not one of those people and if you dont trust me then dont D/L it. Anyone who D/L's this feel free to posrt if there are any spyware/viruses.
,n20,2005-06-18T20:26Z,"v-rex, i dont know if this makes you feel better but i scanned this with kaspersky (clean)  and will install this later tonight. will post if its all good. "
,jmx,2005-06-18T21:29Z,"wodochild.. how was it with the themes thing?
Can you add visual styles to it later?"
,Saikano,2005-06-19T01:59Z,A Swedish version of this would've been the bomb ;)
,brandonlink,2005-06-19T19:24Z,i had trouble with this so i installed winrar to open it and extracted it and copied the extracted files to cd. Is this how you are suppose to do it because i rebooted my pc with cd in drive and nothing happened?...or do i just copy the xp to cd just like it is? what do i do to install xp?
,splur,2005-06-20T18:59Z,"takes up about 800mb on the hdd.

you can windows update, but you need to make a few tweaks before you can.  you'll run into 2 errors, i can lead you through them if you want.

first problem is an installation error of windows update.  [Error number: 0x8DDD0003]

http://www.dougknox.com/xp/scripts_desc/xp_winupd_netpolicy.htm 
(install that to get rid of that error)

then you'll get a second error when windows update searches for updates. [Error Number: 0x8007043B]

,lornloxor,2005-06-22T01:28Z,Hmm anyone managed to get this to work on a S-ATA hard drive?
,eug2k,2005-06-24T02:03Z,Great xp version fast as hell. but i can't get dv capture working in pinnacle or any program for that matter. the scanner and camera wizard is too ripped apart to work so cant use that
,casual84,2005-06-26T11:35Z,"I managed to get this installed on my S-ATA HD with the VIA controller .

Firstly , I copied the contents of the iso file ( mounted with daemon tools ) to a folder on my desktop .
Secondly , I proceeded this way :

1.Go to this folder ""i386"" on yer CD
2.Open the file called ""TXTSETUP.SIF""
3.Add the following lines respectively :
  Under [SourceDisksFiles]
        viasraid.sys = 1,,,,,,4_,4,1,,,1,4
4.Under [HardwareIdsDatabase]
  PCIVEN_1106&DEV_3149 = ""viasraid""
5.Under [SCSI.Load]
        viasraid = viasraid.sys,4
6.Under [SCSI]
        viasraid = ""VIA Serial ATA RAID Controller(Windows XP)""

Save and close ""TXTSETUP.SIF""

-------------------------------------

1.Open the file called ""DOSNET.INF""
2.Add the following line :
  Under [Files]
        d1,viasraid.sys

Save and close ""DOSNET.INF""

-------------------------------------

1.Open the file called ""DRVINDEX.INF""
2.Add the following line :
  Under [driver]
        viasraid.sys

Save and close ""DRVINDEX.INF""

-------------------------------------

Now , just copy the file ""viamraid.sys"" from yer floppy to the folder ""i386"" and rename it to ""viasraid.sys""

-------------------------------------

Finally I burned the new created folder as a bootable CD-ROM using nero ."

,munchtornado,2005-06-28T13:23Z,"To get a swedish keyboard download and install ""Microsoft .NET Framework Version 1.1 Redistributable Package"". Then download and install    "" Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC) Version 1.3.4073 "". Start MSKLC and create a swedish layout. You will find that the swedish characters are already in the english layout so you just reasign the keys. You can also find the unicode charts at http://www.unicode.org/charts/. Install your new 
layout and then go to ""regional and language options"" in the controll panel. click the languages tab and then click the details box. click the add button and chose your new keyboardlayout/IME in the dropdown menu. Do not change the input language, leave it to english. Good luck

I could make the keyboard and win update work, but the little shortcut icon is gone.

,GTI888,2007-07-24T05:25Z,"Virtual printers like Acrobat PDF and Foxit PDF Creator don't install because the system restore service is missing.

To install you need to copy sr.inf (not sure if sr.pnf needed as well) from another windows installation (located in c:\windows\inf)

Right click on sr.inf and then choose install. Point to your 'Stripped to the Bone' cd or a full blown XP SP2 disc and it will install the service. 

I don't think it really installs it properly but it will show up in the services list which should satisfy the installers.

Reboot and install your virtual printers.

When done you can disable the system restore in the service list.

For updates just use http://www.autopatcher.com/ and forget about windows update."
