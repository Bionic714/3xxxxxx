*Note:

Windows File protection is disabled. You can now delete that stupid Xerox folder inside your Program Files!

The Start Bar was tweaked for speed, too.

I was nice to remove the Alexa spyware for you. Alexa is spyware that Windows
XP ships out with. How nice of them. Alexa tracks your browsing habbits. I
thought spyware only came with crappy games and programs? Guess I was wrong.

Index Service is gone.

Prefetch folder in C:Windows is gone.

Max connection limit is set to 50 (for P2P and Bit Torrent)

etc.

Just to give you an idea about what was removed:

Themes (Classic Theme is only available)
Wallpaper
Windows Media Player
Windows Movie Maker
Animated Character for Search
Windows XP Tour
Screensavers
Games
Language Pack
Help
System Restore
Windows Update

If you don't see it in the long list, above - then it was probably ripped.

I've been using this stripped-down version of WindowsXP Pro SP2 Corporate for
about several months now. It's quick to install, and it's stable! It's great for small
hard drives. You'll notice not very many services running in the background, too. It boots fast and shuts down quick.

If you're ever in the need for an extremely light version of XP, then this disc will
be right for you. You'll still be able to get on-line and do everything else, except
that you won't have all the BS that Microsoft forces you to install - that you will
never use.
