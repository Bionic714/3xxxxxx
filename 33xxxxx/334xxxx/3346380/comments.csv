Not many of us are interested in movies that are dubbed to spanish, german or french.
Movies in their ORIGINAL language ONLY!!!
I hate that people in Germany, France and Spain are so f*cking ignorant that they can't learn English. "

A) Very stupid cos the torrent is clearly in spanish; and
B) A fu**ing ignorrant c*ck who needs to broaden his/her mind. "
