,Kifen,2005-06-26T09:47Z,"How can any war be ""glorious"" ?"
,cinephage,2005-06-26T16:36Z,people's war ! how can anyone be stupid enough to believe this load of crap ! a glorious war to go from the so-called indian imperialism to chinese imperialism - and follow the fate of Tibet. To become a part of the worst empire of them all. Where ultra-liberal economy is mixed with totalitarian communism of the worst sort. I feel like puking when I read this bullshit for fools
,infofallout,2005-06-26T17:53Z,"@kifen, People's War is glorious in that it is the people standing up and resisting their oppressors after thousands of years of horrifying opression. It is glorious in the same way as a woman resisting rape (which is actually a huge part of the revolution) is glorious."
,infofallout,2005-06-26T17:55Z,"@cinephage, You misunderstand! The Nepalese revolution is resisting Chinese imperialism too!! In fact, the revisionist dogs of China have condemned the revolution. When the Nepalese win state power, they will be the ONLY socialist country in the world."
,NewGod,2005-06-26T19:21Z,"Hi, I would like find out who finances your little war. Is it North Korea or simply drug dealers? You know that an army cannot exist without financing. Perhaps you don't know even yourself?"
,infofallout,2005-06-26T19:49Z,"@NewGod, actually, the Nepalese people have used Mao's strategy of Protracted People's War. When the revolution started, they were poor peasants armed literally with bows and arrows, and through confrontations with the police and army, they have accumulated incresingly powerful weapons. Maoists strongly oppose druglords and other oppressors of the people, and have never taken money from drug organizations, though they do sometimes recieve donations from trekkers who come to their country to climb Everest and the Himilayas."
,infofallout,2005-06-26T19:52Z,"@NewGod, one other thing I forgot to mention... Maoists do not consider North Korea a socialist country, and oppose dictatorships in the name of socialism."
,NewGod,2005-06-26T20:12Z,I feel sorry for you. You'll find out too late that your leaders are dishonest bastards. You will suffer the same fate as all victims of socialistic experiments. 
,infofallout,2005-06-26T21:16Z,"It isn't a matter of what Maoist leadership says, but also a matter of the historical record of Maoism and the struggle against the drug lords. Please read this article: http://rwor.org/a/china/opium.htm"
,NewGod,2005-06-26T22:13Z,"China is probably planning to occupy your country and join it to its self. You are going to loose at least 100.000 lives in the struggle, while the rest will be slaves closed in prison camps. You'll become an ethnical minority in your own country, just like the Tibetians are today. "
,infofallout,2005-06-27T02:37Z,"@NewGod, no. China, although it opposes the Revolution, has stated that it will not interfere.

India on the other hand, has implied that it wants to invade and drown the revolution in blood. As Chairman Prachanda said, it was never a question of whether the masses would have to face Indian imperialism, but when. Through the strategy of Protracted People's War, the Nepalese do have a great chance at winning against Indian imperialism, but the reason that we need solidarity with our comrades in Nepal is so that we can rally the support of the world against the brutal horrors of Indian imperialism."

,Kifen,2005-06-27T07:53Z,"Today, the papers said that the Mao-rebels have taken 22 schoolkids from a school. Glorious ?"
,infofallout,2005-06-27T18:37Z,"@Kifen, I believe I already addressed that distortion of the truth. No children are ""taken"" from the schools by the CPNM. What HAS happened, is the revolutionary youth on campus have organized walk outs to go meet with CPNM members to hear speeches that refute the lies they are being told in school about the ideology of the CPNM. No students are forced to attend.

However, the BBC, among other reactionary news publications, like to claim that the Maoists are somehow abducting these students. How dare students organize walk outs!"
,kevinbarry,2005-06-29T19:44Z,"infofallout, you are absolutely correct.  The Nepali peasants are standing up to thousands of years of oppression.  In the United States, Bush is sending weapons to the dictator of Nepal, while he is trying to prevent solidarity between Americans and Nepali peasants who follow the CPN(M).  Here we have a situation of the peasants of Nepal standing up against the dictator of Nepal and his American (and Indian) imperialist friends, and of course the bad guys to the bourgeois respondents are the Nepali peasants.  Why don't they just put the yoke back on themselves and serve another man?  Why don't they just be ""good niggers"" who know their place?  The only terrorism taking place is from Bush, who is sending weapons to the dictator of a small country on the other side of the world so the dictator's army can shoot peasants who live as far from so-called civilization as imaginable.  Bush simply won't be happy until he and his backers have dominion over the whole earth, which is why he is so high on killing Nepali peasants who don't ""know their place"" (their place being on their knees to Bush and the Nepali dictator).  Hoist the scarlet banner high!  From the top of Mount Sagarmatha!"
,infofallout,2005-06-30T00:35Z,"@kala_chor, There is nothing terroristic about it. The Nepalese peasants are not suicide bombers, religious fundamentalists, or murderers of any sort. They are taking up arms and resisting a system of fuedal oppression. Calling the Nepalese peasants ""terrorists"" is like condemning women who resist rape.

It is very ironic that you condemn the masses as terrorists, when you then go an uphold an army which the Nepalese people refer to as the Royal Terrorist Army. The Royal Terrorist Army is responsible for the burning of entire villages who have joined the revolution, mass rape of all of the women in entire villages, and other horrors too horrifying to even speak. Fuck the Royal terrorists."

,ktmkid,2006-05-30T17:46Z,"Do you or have you ever lived in Nepal.  I have.  A majority of the people of Nepal live in Kathmandu valley and are not ""peasants"".  Most do live in poverty, but that is not the same thing.  The ""peasants"" do not support the Maoists, they are afraid of them.  The will come into towns and kill anyone who supports the government.  They will kill locally elected officals.  I do not mean big  government type officals, I mean local town low level officals.  Villagers are all scared of the Maoists, not supporters of them.  The term terrorist was used.  Is placing a bomb in the center of Kathmandu and blowing up local ""peasants"" terrorist?  That is up to you, for me it is.  The Maoists don't soley attack goverment locations, but villagers as well.  Terror is their tactic."
