,junichili,2007-06-24T09:52Z,"This is probably coming late, I just have to add a little comment for pauloadeando . An AUDIO(This prefix denotes auditory, or hearing with your EARS-these are the giant egg shaped things sticking out of the side of your head)-book, is a format of information transfer via the ""hearing' senses. Thanks for your time."
,notred,2007-07-04T20:09Z,Does it work on ipod?
,grrleavemealone,2007-07-09T15:56Z,"Just to be perfectly clear to all those downloaders: the format on this is .mov - quicktime movie. The ""video"" is a static shot of the book cover while the audiobook plays. 

I tried 'viewing' this audiobook in quicktime and nero: there don't seem to be chapter breaks.

Thanks for the seed, lving420, but I'd recommend downloaders find another torrent of this book."
