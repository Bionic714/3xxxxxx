,MrChocolate,2006-01-06T09:06Z,I been downloading this file for a few days and now I'm finally done. But I have a problem. I can not play the file. It's all vob and info files and I do not know how to convert them so I can watch them in VLC player. I would be really thankful if someone could help me.
,mtw007,2006-05-19T20:07Z,PLEASE RESEED THIS!!!!!! I can convert this to XViD easily. And i've wanted to watch Def Poetry again so bad. Please!
,mtw007,2006-05-20T22:32Z,"Thank you for seeding this again!
Damn you xx-xxx-177-23.dhcp.aldl.mi.charter.com for your BitComet usage. Slowing down the entire swarm."
,mtw007,2006-05-23T06:24Z,"Everyday this crawls along, teasing me with the thoughts of Def Poetry on my computer monitor! I've turned off all other torrents to help with the uploading, let's get this thing completed!!!"
,mtw007,2006-05-24T20:13Z,Oh Lord so close! Thank you seeder again!
,dvice006,2008-04-02T02:30Z,Thanx for the up; i like the TS. If you manage to get the other seasons on here we would all be very grateful. If you wanna upload on RS I would take the burden off you and upload the torrents myself. ;) RS is faster than torrents if you have a premium account.

Heads up to everyone that this dvd is still set to the USA/Canada region and you will need a player that can handle that"
