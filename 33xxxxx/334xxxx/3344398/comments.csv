- Sweden ; Perfect coverage of Sweden.  
For perfect cover of Sweden the cd version of RTI req 2 cds.

In 2002 Volvo changed to DVD and wide screen in the later model. 

At the time (old version, cds) Volvo came out with 4 cd sets with updates and patches for the RTI system a year!! 

There is no cd protection when if you want to make a backup of your own RTI cd. (so I heard...) but the clever guys at Volvo made diferent versions of RTi to different Volvocars. For example, a Volvo C70 RTI late 99 model and a early 98 does NOT have the same version of the RTi cds. Different compilations. 

If you want to find out what cd is right for your car please call the Volvo spare parts and ask. They will tell you what numbers there should be on the right cd. Write that down and then pay 1500 skr for a new update with 19 cds for countries you never will drive your car in or... go to a local cardealer and testdrive a Volvocar with RTI. Copy the cd with nero or clone cd and put the torrent on this great site. Remember the number!! And share it with the rest of the Volvo loving people in the world.  Write down the make and the model of your Volvo and if youa hde the cd in the glowes appartment or up your a*n*u*s. 

I made a backup of my cd on a 700MB cd for my own personal useage. 

The cd updates your software and your maps. Youa cannot test the cd on your cpmputer. Only in your car. If you get ""This cd is busted please get fukked at the neerest Volvo shop"" the cd ins the wront version. 

I know this for a fact. i s*h*i*t you not. "
