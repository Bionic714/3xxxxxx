,diosisback,2005-06-20T18:53Z,"Actually, the game is called ""Horrible Day 4"", but I messed up while I was uploading it."
,chengan88,2005-06-20T21:23Z,"Please write the info in english, if u can't.. fuck off..."
,GamergodGold,2005-06-21T00:34Z,"why would he have to write the info in english? this is a foreign language site to start with, is it not? Besides, it says in ENGLISH that if you do not know spanish you shouldn't get the game therefore eliminating the need for you to actually read the info."

,javidt,2005-06-21T18:36Z,"Hey he just want to share the game that he and his university's mates have programmed, and advise you that it's in spanish not to waste your time downloading it if you don't understand spanish, because it's a game in the vein of LucasArts' Adventures"
