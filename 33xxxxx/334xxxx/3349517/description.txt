In the second hilarious series of Jeeves & Wooster, Pelham Grenville Wodehouse's immortal characters are once again brought to glorious life by Hugh Laurie as the chinless but charming Bertie Wooster and Stephen Fry as his valet and frequent saviour, Jeeves. Superb period detail, performers who seem to have been born for these roles, and a hearty helping of Wodehouse wit make these shows essential viewing for anyone in search of a sophisticated chuckle. All six episodes are included here: "Jeeves Saves the Cow-Creamer", "A Plan for Gussie", "Pearls Mean Tears", "Jeeves in the Country", "Kidnapped!" and "Jeeves the Matchmaker".
