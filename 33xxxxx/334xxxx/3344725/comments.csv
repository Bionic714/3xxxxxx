,gibbog,2005-06-15T02:16Z,Thanks
,SniperFin,2005-06-15T03:14Z,"This is a fucking rip off of Hoodlum version. Only labeled to NymZ, lame and cheap, suckers."
,hi-tech,2005-06-15T04:44Z,"no group wanted you, so you made your own?
you should help seed the hoodlum release, instead of stealing... "
,kennyinbmore,2005-06-15T12:43Z,I'll try thi sone. The Hoodlum version gives me a bunch of crc errors when extracting
,eXcavator,2005-06-15T18:48Z,"the HOODLUM release is the only (ONLY!!) valid scene iso. It's, like all other proper iso releases, an (almost) exact image of the original source, but it's cracked. if you get crc errors when extracting, it can be because of corrupt rars, or a fucked up unrarer. if the game doesn't work, it doesn't work whatsoever, even if you try another release. HOODLUM's release IS WORKING! I have it myself and have played for HOURS and it fucked only ONCE, but that's NOT HOODLUM's fault. This release is either a ripoff of HOODLUM's release, or a private rip. NymZ is as far as I know NOT a scene group, it's just a lame wannabe releasing ripoffs.. If he knew better he wouldn't release this when the allready exsisting release isn't nuked."
,haggvik,2005-06-15T18:51Z,Copyright? LoL... THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT PLACE TO MENTION THAT WORD !!!!!!!

,g4ngst3r,2005-06-16T08:54Z,"HOODLUM  R U L E S ! 
The GTA SA works perfect. Unrar - Mount - Copy Crack - Play... SWEET."
,g4ngst3r,2005-06-16T11:31Z,"Da HOODLUM-version works perfect, so go download that !"
,h4rl3qu1n,2005-06-16T15:59Z,"This is the location of the HOODLUM scene release that works - http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3341354 - If you still get a CRC-error when extracting, it's not because of the the release being corrupted but probably your download is. Just try again. There are only 2 verified group releases of GTASA: HOODLUM & MDETH. Use those, not anything else. These other guys are just posting the same files under their own name or have made an image of their purchased DVD."
,daffeh,2005-06-16T16:44Z,"wtf.. okey. im a noob at this shit. but help me. 

""1. Open GTA-SA-NymZ.iso with ""Deamon-Tools"" - "" 
And it says ""Unable to mount image - Invalid image file."" when doing that. 

What should I download to get this work?
