The 4400 tells the stories of 4,400 alien abductees after they are returned to earth, but they ended up being abducted by people from the future to save mankind. In the words of the executive producers, these are stories of people dealing with traumatic changes, driven by the mystery of what happened and why. Some of them have been affected in mysterious ways, and some will have certain abilities, both good and bad, so part of the drama will be watching them adjust to these changes within themselves.
