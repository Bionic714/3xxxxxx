,Beaverlicker,2005-06-18T23:25Z,Do you have more Russian Classical Music?Shostakovich?
,fredrika_moberg,2005-06-19T15:43Z,I have LOTS of Sjostakovitj and other Russian/Soviet composers. What do you want?
,fredrika_moberg,2005-06-19T16:04Z,"By the way beaverlicker...that's a rather apalling yet appealing nickname you've got. If I knew you I just might let you...but only if you're a GIRL!

Please specify if you need flac, ogg or if ordinary mp4 or mp3 is okay."
