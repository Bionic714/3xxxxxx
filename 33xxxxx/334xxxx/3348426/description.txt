The award-winning program Typing Tutor 7 from Davidson and Simon & Schuster can teach you how to type easily and efficiently. Choose from a selection of literary excerpts and other blurbs to practice your typing skills, or go for the Regular Lesson which intelligently creates sentences for you to type (though they may not make much sense). There are three typing-related games you can play.

You can use this program to learn how to type, or to hone your already efficient skills even further. Or, try learning another keyboard layout - Typing Tutor 7 supports QWERTY, US Dvorak, and Numpad.
