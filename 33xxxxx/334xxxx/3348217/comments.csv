When i install the soaked expansion pack that i downloaded, it says please insert roller coaster 3 disc 3 ? :/
Can you help me?"
,Skorned,2006-11-22T23:09Z,"harry_2:
if you downloaded the rct3 then just mopunt the third disc to a virtual drive with daemon tools. or if you own the game, just insert disc 3.

you may need to redownload the roller coaster tycoon 3 game fully to register it."

,Coats182,2008-07-25T23:21Z,"e-rock to download this you need something to download the torrent like utorrent. then you just download it on there, seed if you want and sometimes you might need daemon or alcohol 53% or 170% to mount the games to a virtual drive. then you just go from there."
