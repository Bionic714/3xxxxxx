,ethanoic,2005-06-14T12:13Z,I guess people use lesser bit rates because not everyone has good quality audio equipment. 128 kbps is fine for most car players!
,vonkruel,2005-06-14T18:08Z,"Yes it does depend on the quality of your equipment.  In my car I can tell the easily tell the difference between 256 kbps CBR and 192 kbps VBR for example.  The difference between 256 CBR and 320 CBR is more subtle, but I can detect it.

The thing is - at 320 kbps you are still getting NICE compression, WITHOUT sacrificing much quality at all, so why mess around?.  Even at 320 kbps you could still tell the difference sometimes, but you can always use FLAC if you don't want to sacrifice anything.

Even if your equipment is not so good, you still should rip your discs at 320, so that later on, when you upgrade your stuff, you can ""rediscover"" your MP3 collection :)"

flac.sf.net is the shit!"
,vonkruel,2005-06-17T16:31Z,"OGG and FLAC are nice, but MP3 is the most widely playable format."

I bought the CD the week it came out but I couldn't get a rip of it for my MP3 due to a firmware glitch on my CD drive, so I've been waiting for this torrent."
