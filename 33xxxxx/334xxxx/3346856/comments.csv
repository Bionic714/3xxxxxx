,AceVanquish,2005-06-21T00:34Z,"Um...you chose 6mb over user compatability?  It's the xbox section.  People are used to 3-5gig files.   Anyway, kudos.  Scheduled updates would be nice, but follow the pack.  Post .zip or .rar"
,GasGiver4711,2005-06-21T00:41Z,"THX for your reply AceVanquish !
Why do you think 7Zip will give ppl here problems ?
Noone using winrar will have any trouble extracting 7zip files.
Just thought it would be a good idea to help spreading it faster ;-)
If ppl really dislike the idea i will switch to WinRAR again for the next release.

What do YOU think about using 7Zip for the Releases ?
Like it ? or Hate it ?

,GasGiver4711,2005-06-21T01:47Z,"Hi,
there´s nothing wrong with this Release:
20-Jun-2005 XBMC - XBOX MediaCenter 1.1.0 [GasGiver].7z

The newer one i posted here:
http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3346907
just follows the Guidelines for Scene Releases (RAR/SFV/NFO) and so on ...
This will be the standard format from now on.

Greetings

,AceVanquish,2005-06-21T02:07Z,"WinRar 3.10 didn't open it.  I guess it could use an update, I was just suggesting that people usually don't like to change their setup."
,GasGiver4711,2005-06-21T02:31Z,"Yep, you´re right - you need a newer version of WinRAR for it and this suxx :-( I guess >=3.30 would do. The latest Version is 3.42.
I really do like 7Zip, but compatibility is definately an issue when Releasing Stuff to the Public ;-)
So, no more 7ZIP for my XBMC´s"
,GasGiver4711,2005-06-21T02:34Z,Thanks again for your input AceVanquish !!
