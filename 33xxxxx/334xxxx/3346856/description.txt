    INFORMATION:

    This package is my little "contribution" to the scene.

    Hope you like it ... !! Comments & Suggestions are very welcome !!

    If ppl find this useful, im gonna try releasing on a weekly basis.

    I only included the Original Project Mayhem III skin from the CVS to
    keep the Release Size small and to make sure everything works perfectly.
    If you wanna use other skins make sure they are at least Version 1.3 !

    Scripts included:
    FlexiBrowser / GameSaves / GameSpotPlus / GameTrailers / iFilmBrowser
    StupidVideos / QuickTimeBrowser (Movie Trailers) / simpleKML V2 (WebRadio) 

    I modified the SkinProject Mayhem IIIPALDialogSubMenu.xml so that all
    of the Scripts appear in the Scripts Submenu. If you don´t like this or
    some of the Scripts, you should edit this file to your personal preferences.
    The original file from CVS is also still present as DialogSubMenu.xml.ORG.

    Visualisation addons included:
    G-Force: 1507 total (including the 490 CVS supplied ones)
    Milkdrop: 5031 total (including the 436 CVS supplied ones)
    Just in case, the Original CVS Presets are backed up to the folders
    visualisationsG-ForceOriginal Files from CVS
    visualisationsMilkdropOriginal Files from CVS

    RELEASE NOTES:

    Integrated the MilkDrop and G-Force addon Packs that Kevin Sartori released.
    You finally can see the real names of the MilkDrop Presets again !
    THX for your hard work Kevin !
    Deleted some double and triple occurring MilkDrop Presets. [80 files]
    Again, I added numbers in the format [XXXX] to the MilkDrop Presets.
    If you happen to see the most BrainSmashing MilkDrop Vis ever produced
    - while smoking your favorite shit - you can remember it by its number ;-)

    The Project Mayhem Webserver V1.1 is now included too.
    Sorry for that, I just forgot to add the Files coz I´ve never used it ...

    I changed the Compression Method for my Releases to 7Zip. (www.7zip.org)
    Compared to WinRAR - it makes this Release about 6MB smaller.  
    Don´t complain about me using 7Zip, WinRAR extracts "*.7z", too :-P

    The problem with videos not playing using the "Film Grain Effect" is fixed.
    THX to the Devs! - i missed this - on that single Day it was broken ;-)
    They also fixed the "RSS Newsfeeds not working" issue. (changed home.xml)

    CHANGELOG:

    To keep this .nfo shorter, I only provide you with the last 3 lines here
    so you can see what´s included. You can find the official XBMC Changelog at  
    http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/xbmc/XBMC/Changelog.txt?view=markup
    It is also included in docsChangelog.txt

    Some TIPS:

    If you are experiencing all kinda weird problems using an updated version
    of XBMC it is always a good idea to delete the XBMC´s SaveGame
    using the Micro$oft Dashboard. Alternatively you can just delete the
    E:TDATA face008 and E:UDATA face008 directories.
    This is especially important if you are updating from quite an old version.

    To avoid problems you should also check - with every new release - 
    if the included XboxMediaCenter.xml has been changed significantly.
    You should then update your own customized XboxMediaCenter.xml accordingly.

    THANKS:

    All the XBMC developers !!
    Your program makes the XBOX worth soOo much more for all of us !
    Everyone contributing to the scene !
    This would not have been possible without some guy (he didn´t leave a name)
    releasing the "MakeXBMC Essential Files Package". Thanks Mate !

    PS:

    By now, everyone and his grandma should know that the Milkdrop
    and the G-Force presets too, can (and really should !) be zipped up ;-)
    If they aren´t, your beloved XBOX will eat your HDD and slow to a crawl
    when using all the available "Milkdrop addon" presets.
