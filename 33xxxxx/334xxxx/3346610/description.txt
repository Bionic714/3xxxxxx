Oz Season2. The rest of the sieres will bill in order now, as soon as one gets a few seeds I'll bail and put up the next. After this sdeason, only 11 gigs to go. To those who havent finished watching season 1, you arent going to be able to. Over the years a few zeros and a few ones got mixed up and the last episode will only play for about 2 min. Thats on my copy and there is'nt anything i can do. Shit happens. Talk to you in a few days. Later
