,bada-bing,2007-04-01T01:04Z,Would have been nice to have been told the last episode was fucked before I downloaded the entire series one.
,thefatkid43,2009-11-27T22:20Z,to bada-bing: your a fucking idiot. he states in the description that the last episode isnt working right.. learn to read and you wont look like a moron on the internet.
