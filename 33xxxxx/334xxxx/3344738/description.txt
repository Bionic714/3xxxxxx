* Thanks to ViTALiTY for the CDRom version. 


Uncle Francesco left Kevin and Kimberly because he can not pay his bills 
anymore. Their poor uncle is ashamed of himself! There is only one chance to 
get their fat Uncle Francesco back: Earn loads of money, within 24 hours, with 
the pizza restaurant ! 

Earning money requires a lot of work. After taking the order by phone, they 
have to prepare the order in the kitchen, by preparing all the 
pizza-ingredients (cheese, pepperoni, tomato, ananas, onions, etc, etc) and 
also prepare other extra orders (fries, soda, salad). 

After finishing the pizza one of them has to drive in Kevin's supercharged quad 
to the customer: and here the difficult part starts! If the Pizza is delivered 
too late, the customer will not pay for his pizza. Because of this 'golden 
rule', all pizza customers will try to make your delivery as hard as possible. 
Their loose (wild) dogs and many other obstacles will make you use your jump 
and run action to the max. 

Can you make a pizza and deliver it within time? Proof it. In "PizzaDude - 
Special Delivery".
