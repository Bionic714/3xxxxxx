,nomods,2005-06-21T01:44Z,"oh yeah... and PISS on FOX for canceling it! this show just got better and better... Can't understand why they (media in general) let crap like ""The Bold And The Beautiful"" and ""Days of our lives"" run for 40+ years and such...   "

For those who didn't know SfC is an old group that dealt mostly with releasing trance-livesets from wellknown and amateur DJ's a couple of years back, but has been dorment for a long time.
Hope they rise to the stars again, cause this group dont know what bad quality is :)"
