,Asmor,2005-07-25T19:59Z,"How do you install this game? It keeps asking for a cd when I run it, so do i need a no-cd crack as well?"
,drtysnchz,2005-07-27T01:59Z,Burn it to a dvd or use DAEmon tools. 
,verman84,2005-08-04T04:49Z,"I tried using daemon tools and it would still say ""wrong disk please insert correct disk"" also, after i burnde it to dvd, it would say that i need to insert the correct disk

,Cooloosus,2007-03-18T11:21Z,"OK forget it I figured it out.

1: Burn the .iso file on a DVD or mount it in DAEMONTOOLS

2: Install the game. (remember the folder you install it in.)

3: Open the CD and go in the HOODLUM folder.

4: Copy the GTA_SA file in to the folder you installed the game in.

5: Overwrite! and enjoy the game!"
,Sygate,2007-05-07T20:47Z,"Lo he bajado, y he grabado la ISO con DeepBurner, lo he ejectuado, se carga bien el menú de instalación, selecciono las opciones de instalación y cuando ya lleba un rato instalando, salta un error en el data2.cab error cíclico y se cierra la instalación, ¿Como puedo solucionar este problema)"

,jegernorsk,2008-08-28T13:23Z,"Hey! I know this sounds weird and i agree im an amateur on this but need some help here! When i download this too 100%, it says Seeding...when i would believe it should stand downloaded! Is it done then?"
,AxxaVerKa,2008-09-13T11:23Z,Yes it has finished. Seeding just means that you are hosting the file and letting others download it.
,Mike727,2008-11-04T21:35Z,"Is this an english version of the game?

El juego es en inglís? O no? Por favór dínos! No quiero jugar un juego con los morenos quíen se hablan espa?ol. Porque yo no hablo espa?ol, y no podía entenderlos. Y por eso, el juego no será divertido. Gracias!

,sruiztag,2008-11-06T01:05Z,"hey, i had alredy installed the game, but when i run it with daemontools, it shows an error that says that i have to install directx 9.0, but i had alredy installed it. what can i do?"
,sruiztag,2008-11-06T01:07Z,"hola, ya instale el juego, pero cuando lo trato de jugar me aparece un error que dice que se necesita al menos el directx 9.0, pero ese ya lo instale. que puedo hacer?"
,Mike727,2009-01-02T06:45Z,"I mounted this with Alcohol, and when I run the autostart installer, it says that I'm missing EAinstall.dll file and won't work. If I explore the CD and run the Setup file manually, the same problem occurs. Is anyone else getting this problem?"
,jbd32123,2009-12-18T22:24Z,"This file has a virus in it, in the HOODLUM folder. Be careful when you're mounting the iso image. I made a new iso image without the HOODLUM folder, and used the crack by itself, hopefully didn't expose my comp to virus."
,Megazero,2010-03-24T22:46Z,"@jbd32123

Obviously you dont know, Anti-virus programs have a tendency to pick up stuff like cracks and stuff as virus'. your computer is safe."
,A3DS97,2010-08-10T17:58Z,@redving sWE you have to extract the .rar file with winzip or 7zip
,adamlin,2011-01-16T20:26Z,Nice torrent man.I already Uploaded 6.69 GB.I'll keep seeding till' you kill the torrent :).Thanks once again :D
,adamlin,2011-01-24T18:07Z,I uploaded 21 GB :D!
,61stylo,2011-02-03T00:56Z,I recommend NOT to download this torrent. It's too slow.
,legolas04,2011-07-07T17:34Z,"I am downloading this now because I broke my 2005 SA disc and bought the new one. But nothing works on it, no hot coffee, CLEO mods act very weird. This torrent is excellent, this is the 2005, the first release with all the modding enabled. I will seed for the rest of my life if I get this 100% downloaded. THANKYOU"
,iNeedAWorkingUsernameFFS,2012-04-18T10:36Z,"Good torrent. This is the original Hoodlum release from '05 (the one with the bug in the crack only allowing english and spanish as the game language).

Works fine (also for MTA). Seeded 195GB so far in 3 or so days :)"
,mr.rap3r,2012-04-30T06:02Z,woweeee! this is fantastic this could be the most important discovery since..........AAAIIIIIIIRRR
,mr.rap3r,2012-04-30T06:04Z,oh and all of you who say it took days ontop of days well it only took me 5 min and i downloaded it 2 weeks ago
,ro112bert,2012-05-07T21:14Z,"plz help me i dont understant what you mean with the the folder you installed the game in?
plz e-mail me or something

email: DJ-beatmaster@hotmail.nl"
,iNeedAWorkingUsernameFFS,2012-05-09T02:41Z,"ro112bert: Install the game, then go into the HOODLUM folder on the DVD and copy the gta_sa.exe to where you installed GTA to.

On Vista or Win7 64bit, that would normally be
C:Program files (x86)Rockstar GamesGrand Theft Auto San Andreas

On XP or Vista/Win7 32bit, it's the same, just without the ""(x86)""

Paste the gta_sa.exe in there and overwrite the original. That's all you need to do ;)

Note: The crack that comes with this DVD only allows English and Spanish as the game language. That was a fail on HOODLUM's part and they released a 2nd crack which allows all languages the game supports. I had this 2nd crack at one point, but I don't know where I put it."
