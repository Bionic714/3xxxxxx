Combined the French DVDRip video with the English TeleSync audio. So basically here's an English DVDRip for ya.

There were some problems syncing the audio and video, and it took me 3 hours to make this with VirtualDub. I fixed all the out of sync parts i could find but there might still be some parts where thay don't sync, but if it is, it's like 0,1sec off so nothing major.
