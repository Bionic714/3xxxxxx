Oni is an anime-themed third-person combat/platformer game, starring the lovely Konoko, a TCTF officer. The combat engine focusses on hand-to-hand combat on par with many fighting games, but in a much larger world. It's often thought of as the black sheep of Bungie's games, since Marathon, Myth, and Halo were all better-received.
