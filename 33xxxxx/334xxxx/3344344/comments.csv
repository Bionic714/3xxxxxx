,panpo98,2005-06-22T06:23Z,If only Bungie had made the game the way they promised and not removed so many cool stuff then it could have been more sucessful.
,BeagleBandit,2005-06-24T07:06Z,"Well, it wasn't Bungie's fault...Micro$oft bought them and let them release what they had done, but that's it:-("

Not true. I included the Carbon version, which works great on 10.1-10.4. It's in Oni-1.0v1.36.dmg."
,jptjr639,2006-03-03T13:20Z,"the game was ok, but my mouse cracked out on it, it probably would have been better if my mouse would just do as it were told. I like that it comes with a cheat app, and the Carbon installer."
,iw2155,2006-03-13T05:39Z,"Awesome game.  Great story, great gameplay.  Now if only they made it into a movie..  I would be camping out within hours if they announced this game being made into a movie.."

,emj77,2006-10-29T01:42Z,"Works perfectly on my miniMac Duo, remmeber to change the resolution to 32bit, 16 bit is awfull. 

To install on  Intel macs do this:

Drag the folder ""Oni f"" somewhere like Applications, then replace the Oni.app in there with the new patch.

And buy the fucking game!"

Thanks for this game. I have a Mac Intel and I don't know how to run the game. I didn't understand your advice, I'm not that good at English... Please help me."
,bajsbulle,2007-03-21T01:00Z,this is probably one of the best games for the mac. too bad they dont make more of these.
,ReduxDengaku,2007-09-09T16:30Z,"Crashes when I run on my Intel Mac.

Step 1) Copy Oni f from Oni.dmg to applications
Step 2) Copy Oni from 1.0v1.36.dmg to Oni f in applications

Did i miss a step?"
,xsho_nuffx,2007-10-14T02:48Z,"How do i keep it at a better resolution? When i set it better it just crashes and i reopen and its back to 640?

The downloaded app works perfectly on my 2.16 GHz iMac running 10.4.11"
,Fresnel149,2008-10-26T11:10Z,But... Bungie never made Oni for OSX... :/
,Andre_D,2009-03-21T22:53Z,"Alert

You need to select the installation directory for Oni.

It says that when i try to start the game. Anyone help?"

,anhedonia,2010-05-19T00:25Z,"Thanks! Always wanted to play this.

How I got it to work; Copy the Oni ? from the Oni.dmg somewhere on your computer, then copy the Oni.app from the Oni-1.0v1.36.dmg to apps folder. When it asks you to select installation folder, select the Oni ?. Hope this helps."
