,Bishounen,2007-08-09T20:38Z,"You know Kentuki, posting a link to a Russian web-forum that requires registration is kinda pointless to the VAST majority of PB users that don't speak or read Russian. 

Although I will admit Russian is a very cool language, I'm sure there are many others would would rather you just snag the torrent off the forum and post it here on PB, rather than force us to learn Russian just to get the Torrent.

Besides that, it's rude to post links to forums in other people's torrent comments."

Most people here don't read Russian (i would imagine you prob don't either) and it would be helpful if he just gave us a direct link to the torrent. And the US is not the only country in the world that speaks English as a primary language, the British did it first. "
