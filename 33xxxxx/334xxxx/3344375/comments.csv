The download started at 42.8%, just where the old one had stalled.  Hope that answers your question about how to make a new listing resume an old download....."

There is allways time to leran new stuff xD"
,IvanOverkill,2005-06-15T07:12Z,Is this torrent still active? Now I'm stuck at 80.2% and it looks like everyone else is as well.(about 20 of uis!).... Would like to get it finished! Download speed has been very slow - i's taking a very long time for a 211MB file.
,tomdrayson,2005-06-16T15:32Z,I'm also stuck at 80.2% please SEED!
