,SLAYER_OF_ENGLISH,2006-04-25T23:36Z,"Before losing your rag learn something about audio formats and how to use them.

Why the hell anyone would want to convert Monkey Audio ( lossless ) files to mp3 is beyond me.

,sefred,2006-04-25T23:43Z,"Gee, why don't you ask APPLE or CREATIVE or any of the other manufacturer of players why they don't support your silly-ass format, JACKASS!"
,sevendegrees,2007-09-26T15:50Z,"use mediamonkey. very simple. ive never seen an audio file it cant handle. also .ape is lossless monkey audio im pretty sure, so they go together nicley"
,manmade2008,2007-10-11T01:57Z,"thx Yhmco! .. continue to support the lossless formats like Ape and Flac .. If u ever get yourself a nice highend setup, compressed music like MP3 just will make both u and your equipment suffer.. ;) 
ps. there's too many haters out there.. pathetic."

,omega1147,2008-03-26T18:10Z,"How to deal with APE or monkey's audio
install the following in order listed

Install WinAmp 5.5.2 then install monkey's audio 4.01 beta 2 make sure you allow Monkey's Audio installer to install plug-in for WinAmp

http://Winamp.com
http://monkeysaudio.com/download.html

Now select .cue file right click select open with select program from list choose or select WinAmp burn CD from WinAmp then take said burnt CD use any program you want and convert to desired format.

You can open APE file using procedure above and play CD image from WinAmp as well."
,omega1147,2008-03-26T18:23Z,If the above does not work use Alcohol 120% to open and burn .cue file for the desired CD this is how i burned the CD's
,omega1147,2008-03-26T18:36Z,.cue file for vault is corrupt track 15 Bringin' on the Heartbreak has no length 
,omega1147,2008-03-26T19:02Z,after converting vault to wave had to sepparate the tracks myself i will agree with some main files appear intact but very poor .cue files witch either bad or damaged
,rozyka,2008-04-24T18:41Z,"You should use CDRWIN(version 4.0G).
The damaged cue files will be correct with it.
I can write audio CDs with it correctly."
,Serge The Banshee,2008-06-24T21:41Z,On each .cue file last track is lost.
,Serge The Banshee,2008-06-24T21:43Z,"Sorry, I mean 2 CD ""Best of"".
Don't know about other .cue files."
,2BRO2B,2009-01-26T01:54Z,"APE is a lossless audio-encoding format.  APE is, as implied above, non-standard.  

FLAC is another lossless audio-encoding format.  FLAC is a standard.  

Apple, Creative, Microsoft, et. al., want to promote lossy formats because 1) they can say you get more songs in their players (true), and 2) If your hearing grows up, then you can replace your mp3 collection with something from which they might possibly make a profit.  

Besides, FLAC is like Macintosh:  ""No one uses THAT!"".   (Well, idiots do say that! Happy them.)

To be clear:  Use 320s or FLACs, forget the rest!  FLAC is a user-community derived standard, so is preferred over the others.  (FLACs, AIFF, APE, and some .wav files are all lossless.)"
,DarkJoe,2011-02-18T13:45Z,"All2MP3.APP for the MAC OS [ALL] should cover it, but if your using a WIN OS, I suggest doing what was said about WinAMP.APP & the Monkey Audio Converter PLUG-IN.
Just GOOGLE it & it'll give you a page for them. GL."
,chitchatid,2011-03-17T07:41Z,"google these programs:
1. to convert from ape to mp3: im2audiomaker
2. split it by soundforge.
3. tag it by mp3tagtools.
i did that for Jennifer Rush Discography.
donot blame the uploader...."
