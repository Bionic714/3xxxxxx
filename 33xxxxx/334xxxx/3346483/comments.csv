,hyper22,2006-05-18T00:43Z,"Great game, very simple install and it worked great."
,Claw_gr,2006-05-21T01:15Z,Are you sure you installed it properly? (It propably have been the registry file regsetup.reg needs to be added to regedit) if doubleclicking doesnt work ( if opens it as readme) try going to run --> regedit and import it from there

Just unpack to the desired folder(no installation required!!!) and start game using the s3.exe icon. Write in the supplied serial (its in the serial.txt file, in the unpacked folder with all the rest of the files) when prompted. Then its just gameplay and no worries.....ThnX 4 this."

,Wartsi,2008-09-18T09:29Z,"I got Vista, and I just unpacked it, and it starts up fine. But when I try to enter the serial key, that error message pops up. Any idea how to make this work?"
,pikkitt,2008-10-01T23:45Z,"I had the same problem on vista.  Windows error #800700005 (Access is denied) occurred at error check, file E:\siedler3\Win32\Registry.cpp,line 48. I opened the exe file a second time as ""administrator"" and it worked fine."
,Overkill360,2008-10-31T09:53Z,"Great quality, works fine"
,JegGir,2008-11-21T13:17Z,Thanks for the advice. I started the game as administrator and it all worked fine.
,Yokkei,2008-12-08T21:25Z,"Well, I managed to get it working, thx for help ppl! U should extract it to a desired folder, run the registry thingy (accept all those weird things) and run as admin to play. The serial is found in a .txt file with the same name. 

There is also a program which generates serials there too, but when I tried that I only got without the expansion.  

Then I figured the uploader had been in a good mood when he made this: when starting singleplayergame, it says ""fuck off's game"" ;P

thx for this one! ++"
