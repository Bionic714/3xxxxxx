And shove your Ipod spam."
,e2npau,2005-06-26T08:25Z,"this one doesn't run on winxp-x64, just tried it myself."
,ph4ze,2005-06-27T16:57Z,"Right, it doesn't. If your on Win 9x or ME, it will install NAV 2005."
,matrixis,2005-06-27T22:14Z,"This is a first release Beta, so it WILL have lots of bugs in it, may cause problems with other symantec software... even beta testers are told not to have other symantec software installed when testing it. up to you ppl if you want something that might not do what it's meant to do..... protect you from viri"
,ratmonster,2005-07-06T14:39Z,I downloaded this a few days ago and had major problems! When I tried to reboot the system it close down immediatly every time. I could start in safe mode but it wouldn't let me restore or delete the file. I had to redo the whole lot from a back up on another drive. I advise you to stay WELL AWAY. I'm using xp pro with sp2 and run Norton 2005
,suske66,2005-07-06T17:22Z,this seems to be very nice
