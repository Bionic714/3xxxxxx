,jussilas,2005-06-28T02:38Z,I have a problem with a movie from the first cd... The movie starts right after i leave the town of dali with the zeppelin and it plays about 5 secs and then tilts. ive tried both ntcs and pal version but i've allways bumped into this problem. Can anyone help?
,Stonkie,2005-06-28T04:23Z,I downloaded it in 6 hours!!!
,patrikzidane,2005-06-28T07:20Z,"jussilas: what are u running it on? playstation? emulator?

if u are running it on playstation it could be errors on the cd when u burned it.. if u are running it on an emulator try using my guide up here and visit http://www.lordkane.co.uk/ for best video configuration on FF 9... try and describe a little more, how many different releases have u tried or how many times have u burned it and so on."
,creep,2005-06-28T12:24Z,uhm.. it's black and white for me = NTSC ?
,patrikzidane,2005-06-28T14:08Z,creep: give me some more information dude... did u burn it? did u use my guide? are u using an emulator? have u installed the plugins? be smart and give a bit more information before u post...
,creep,2005-06-28T14:22Z,"It was NTSC, I patched it to PAL and it all works fine now. I'm playing it on my playstation, no emulator. got the color back"
,patrikzidane,2005-06-28T16:54Z,"i just ran it in ePSXe with PAL settings.. meaning it acts like a PAL playstation and it worked fine, i got colors and everything.. ohwell, it works, dosnt matter if its PAL or NTSC because its so easy to fix, either with the colors or patching it to PAL.."
,creep,2005-06-28T16:59Z,"hehe yeah... well it may be my chip who's acting wierd.. i patched it wit PAL4U, http://www.pal4u2000.com, works with most of the games :) it's very easy and simple to use too.. anyhow,  thanks for this game patrikzidane!"
,Stonkie,2005-06-29T20:22Z,"I forgot to mention I was running 7 other bittorrent downloads at the same time... What I meant is that it is a record, I haven't found any other source for this game that went 1/10 of that speed (I thought it was obvious, since most of the time it goes at something like 3-4 kb/s and and takes near 100-120 hours...)!"
,cphp,2005-06-30T12:47Z,"""I have a problem with a movie from the first cd... The movie starts right after i leave the town of dali with the zeppelin and it plays about 5 secs and then tilts. ive tried both ntcs and pal version but i've allways bumped into this problem. Can anyone help?""

I have the same problem. I`ve tryed every video configuration but with no succes. I guess the movie is broken or something. What do you guys say? Should I start downloading from other torrent. But it`s kind of difficult becouse I have only 30Kb/s at high speed."
,cphp,2005-06-30T13:12Z,"Yey, yey, yey, happy, happy, happy. Guess what I`ve made it! I`ve downloaded epsxe 1.52 and it works with this version. The movie is running. Hope that I will not encounter any other problems. "
,cphp,2005-06-30T13:22Z,"Oh, I forgot to say that the problem appears only if you`re using epsxe 1.60. This version has problems with ffIX. "
,patrikzidane,2005-06-30T13:53Z,"yup, exactly what i wouldhave writen if u warnt so dam fast answering your own posts :D FF IX does not work well with ePSXe 1.6.0.... shouldhave seen that one comming but sry for not writing it before.. jsut forgot it but now its brought up which is good.. so to everyone: USE ePSXe 1.5.2 WITH FINAL FANTASY 9 (IX) SINCE THERE IS A GLITCH WITH ePSXe 1.6.0 WITH THIS GAME"

,Devilz91,2005-07-13T20:36Z,"Yeah, but now I have the same prob with the Earth Guardian too.."
,Devilz91,2005-07-15T18:56Z,Ok I beat everything now you just have to worry about that dude in the palace the Earth Guardian and Kuja you can use Thundaga in Disc 4.
,Jakut,2005-07-17T23:45Z,The game freezes on the cut scene where you leave that doll making village in the cargo ship.
,Devilz91,2005-07-19T23:51Z,"You use ePSXe 1.52 and it should work fine, I beat the game already."
,Taklus,2005-07-20T12:51Z,"I'v got a small problem on disc 3. in the desert temple when I'm going to take some magic using stone thing boss. (it's after that airship boss where u can't use magic). the battle starts out fine, but when it use thunder magic the game just stop. everything is moving and working, but the attack won't come. do u know how I can fix this?"
,pulpfict0n,2005-07-20T17:15Z,"how to fix this : in the desert palace does sleep, poison or thundaga the the characters just stand still or the whole game just crash!!!!!

plz help ( i use 1.52,everyting is perfect exept this )"
,Jinn_Reeso,2005-07-21T18:07Z,Ive got a problem whenever i do battles...The intro to the battle goes really slowly but after about 10 seconds it goes to normal speed...Anything to fix it?
,Jinn_Reeso,2005-07-21T22:22Z,I'm using ePSXe & i followed instructions...anyone?
,Zobie,2005-07-24T01:30Z,erg... 3 seeds 30 leechers? cmon people!
,dk86,2005-07-24T11:16Z,"In the desert palace the stone boss only uses 3 attacks - thundaga blizzaga and firaga, thundaga of which crashes the game 100% of the time. I am wondering how you are suppoused to beat this guy, i've already restarted it about 20+ times only to have him use thundaga on the first or 2nd turn each time."
,dk86,2005-07-24T11:19Z,"or better yet if there is a fix availible... everything has worked fine to this point, i use 1.52... its confirmable that it is only a disc 3 problem as well, snice i got thundaga casted on me by dragons earlier in the game. Is there a seperate disc 3 image to DL somewhere? if that is in the probleM? "
,Devilz91,2005-07-24T18:00Z,Ya need to be good enough to kill em.  I have a save right before the final boss if you want it tha badly...
,pulpfict0n,2005-07-24T18:51Z,"Give me ur save after the boss in desert palace, its the only way for me to continue my game :(
(i wish u have good level caracter ,alot of weapon and money :)  )"
,pulpfict0n,2005-07-24T22:00Z,"!!! ok forget all , i finish desert palace and beat the boss , whit many try , i have to kill monster and boss realy fast before they use some magic who freeze the game."
,Devilz91,2005-07-24T22:42Z,"I don't have a save right after the boss...but you're going to have the same problem with Earth Guardian, the dude in Pandemonium, and Kuja.  Good luck."
,dk86,2005-07-26T09:40Z,"I was wondering if you recall what level your party was, which party members you used and any particular strategies you used for beating these bosses quick enough so that they don't cast thundaga before you defeat them"
,dk86,2005-07-26T21:06Z,"the stone boss in the palace i finally beat after numerous tries, the earth guardian i did as well since he wasn't even as hard. reaosn being since he has a lot of other possible attacks that he can use. Now i'm to the point where im trying to fight Kuja, but it seems pretty impossible to drain all his HP down as it looks like every turn he has a 50% chance to use Thundaga(with his other spell being demi). If you know of some trick or tactic to get around this that would be great"
,dk86,2005-07-26T21:57Z,"i dunno if my % are wrong or i just have really bad luck, i've been reloading the game continuously off savestate on him, and i counted, he casted thundaga to start off the fight 24/25 times that i fought him. the one time that he casted demi first, he casted thundaga on the 2nd turn"
,MattMacD,2005-07-26T22:12Z,"This is most definately NTSC, not PAL.
"
,Devilz91,2005-07-26T23:23Z,Anyone who wants my save...add me on MSN...allthenamesarestolen@hotmail.com
,Devilz91,2005-07-26T23:38Z,"On second thought..the boss isn't that hard.  He only has 12K hp...let's say you have either Quina or Steiner in the party, if Steiner has Shock then that'd be 9999, if Quina has Limit Glove have her start at 1 hp for a quick 9999 dmg."
,skydragon,2005-07-29T05:18Z,"umm...I really need some help. I have all the plugins and everything is fine, but when i load the BIN file with deamon tool, i get a black screen. Do you have MSN?"
,Black Mage,2005-07-29T14:07Z,"I Need some help too,,

Ive downloaded it perfectly...for the PSX, no use of emulator.
cd's 2, 3 and 4 work perfectly...
but CD1, i really dont know what to put 
on an empty cd to let it work...

Can some1 help me out?"
,Black Mage,2005-07-29T15:14Z,"ohh, i found it..."
,Countrylunatic,2005-08-01T05:46Z,To beat the Boss in the desert place. Cast Reflect on all party members ( Carbunkle ) and then have vivi cast blizarra or any stronger spell on all of your party members instead of just one. With blizzarra I did anywhere from 3000 to 4000 damage. Then round it off with Tsunami from Dagger/Garnet. A couple of rounds is all it should take.
,stickyfingaz,2005-08-01T15:51Z,WOrks just fine for me!.. :)
,funiek,2005-08-02T00:10Z,Do you know some cheats that I can beat this desert boss in one hit or something like that??
,Lenneth,2005-08-03T14:43Z,"Poison freeses the game =(
Any way to avoid that?
I tryed both 1.60 and 1.52 they do the same thing"
,Jinn_Reeso,2005-08-04T02:12Z,"Can anyone try to help me fix my problem?
Using Daemon Tools, epsxe 1.6 & 1.53, everything else was working fine up until I finished with Lindblum on Disc 1...I can do 1 battle and then im running around on the world map & it just freezes...anyone?"
,Devilz91,2005-08-04T06:41Z,"Okay, I'll say this once.

Desert Palace: Avoid fighting battles, to make the boss easier you can have Quina kill herself, then use Auto-Life followed by Limit Glove, and the rest of the guys can just attack.

Earth Guardian: Have Zidane in trance, if you can't then Quina needs to use the Limit Glove trick as stated above, don't bother stealing and have Zidane attack, or Thievery if it does a decent amount of damage.

The second forced battle in Pandemonium: Kill off Quina to bring Zidane in, because when he does go in the boss' health resets, Steiner should use Shock if available and Zidane uses physicals (or Thievery).

Kuja: Eiko summons Carbuncle to prevent Thundaga from being used; but Flare Star will be constant, so end the battle quickly."
,Fusti,2005-08-05T10:55Z,"OK i've played Final fantasy IX with only 2 problems To cd 4
1.St is when you get the airship. Press like f4 f5 and it worked for me(it usally freezes)
2. When entering a battle It goes pretty slow.(Its an emubug you can't fix it) lower your graphics makes it go some faster but still slow."
,Fusti,2005-08-05T10:56Z,also use ePSXe 1.6.0
,Fusti,2005-08-05T11:10Z,Heres a trick also when you get quina and get Doom lvl5 go to the hard dragons that can kill you in like one hit and use doom lvl 5 with quina you get massexp in beginning of the game :)
,Jinn_Reeso,2005-08-06T04:09Z,Fusti I did everything you said & pressed F4 F5 in all sorts of combinations with each other but no kudos.  Anything else I should try? Anyone?
,skydragon,2005-08-07T01:07Z,someone wanna help me? = 
,skogen211,2005-08-10T00:32Z,"Stuck on Airship cd1 it freezes

,Devilz91,2005-08-11T18:46Z,"Read all the comments in this page before asking more questions which have already been answered.

And use ePSXe 1.52 for this game, because there are several FMVs which will not work with the 1.60 version."
,skydragon,2005-08-13T05:45Z,But how do you get it to work? All I see if a damn black screen. >.
,Narpas,2005-08-14T23:59Z,"A disc 3 solution is on the way! The Disc 3 included with this file is damaged. There is no emulator fix that can be provided - all that can be done is to beat enemies quickly and keep saving/loading. Right now, however, I'm sending the account ff9.disc3@gmail.com, password UltraPro, a *working* disc 3 img file. I've tested this myself. It should be sent by ten o'clock, August 14. If someone would be so kind, would they either:

Provide this file in a seperate torrent on this site, or
Update this current torrent with the new img file.

I really appriciate this site, but I also don't know - nor do I care to know - how to set up a torrent. I've got the file, you guys can play with it. :-D

Hope this helps people!"
,skydragon,2005-08-15T23:11Z,"Alright, got this game working. I got a question. During the  sword-fighting chapter near the begining, does it seem fast? I can't keep up LOL"
,Devilz91,2005-08-17T19:04Z,"Perhaps you have accidentally sped up the game by pressing one of those buttons on the Delete Menu (accessed by pressing Delete).  It's the button called FL or something.  Don't use FS though, as it will crash your game at some point."
,Devilz91,2005-08-17T19:05Z,"Narpas, a Disc 3 solution would be greatly appreciated.  Otherwise it'd be impossible to finish my level 1 game."

You can find a host of completely working emulators and roms at emuparadiseDOTorg--I got all four discs for FFIX as well as a working emulator for them, and didn't have to use Daemon Tools or anything--all you need is WinRAR to extract everything. Just get ePSXe 1.5.2 as the emulator (not a later version because it causes a problem with certain sections of the game), and voila. If anyone needs more help, contact me at o0whimsicat0oATgmailDOTcom. :) Enjoy! It might take a bit of time and searching to configure everything, but it IS worth it."

,BamProd,2007-03-25T00:45Z,"Alright, I thought I'd just clear some stuff out:
CD 3 in this torrent is damaged. It freezes when you or enemies use spells like thundaga, watera, poison and so on. It's not a emulation error, it's the file. 
Don't fret though, it's fixable.
What I did to solve this was to follow Inkbloot's advice and download a new CD3 from emuparadiseDOTorg (replace the DOT with a . of course). It's a bit of a drag, since you have to go through their voting policies and shit, but you want the goddamn game to work, right? 
Do like this:
1 Click your way through the site until you get to ff9 cd3
2. Do their annoying but understandable voting thing. (it's not THAT annoying, it's just three clicks, no popups, bullshit or anything)
3 Download away!
It's 9 rar files in total, and you can only DL one at a time. But it's better than having to stop playing when you've spent over 10 hours on it already, riiiiight?
Anyways, I'm real happy I got it to work fairly easy without having to use a gameshark or use some really complicated tactic to kill the bosses. I hope you get it to work too.

For the Airship leaves Dali in CD1 and it crashes problem: I just changed emulator. Save to a memcard and open it with another emu, like Psxeven, go through the FMV, then save to memcard and open it with epsxe again. 
Other people have solved it easier though: just download an earlier version of ePSXe... and it will work! Now why didn't I just read these comments first thing intead of spending hours trying to get it to work myself? 
...well, at least I've got the ""yay, I got it to work myself"" feeling.

Hope at least one FF lover gets their problem solved by this, otherwise I've wasted a perfectly fine 10 minutes of my life."

-Download eppsxe version 1.52
-Copy over all your old plugins
-Boot up FF9 in 1.6, and save at the inn before you head to the airship.

Do this because save states aren't transferable between different epsxe versions, but memory card saves are.

-So after you save at the inn, exit epsxe, copy the memory card save into the memory card folder of version 1.52.
-Boot up ff9 in 1.52, load the memory card save from the inn, enjoy!

BTW
the iso isn't corrupt, because i loaded the actual game from the cd, and got the same bug. for whatever reason, 1.6 doesn't like ff9.

I ran the patched file, and got more than just the black screen. I reached the trainer (cheat page). However, pressing the X-button makes the music loop for 1 or 2 secs, and the whole thing crashes, giving me the possibility to send an error report or choose not to. You know, the usual thing. 

Anyone got a suggestion?"

So the downloading and the seeding was big difference. I will seed until i've seeded about 20gb. I have downloaded much from piratebay, some things download fast, some dont. But i will be nice, when some others peoples are. You cant just download things and never seed, its not fair. What do you think you get downloads from. If no body seeds, nobody can ever download torrents. So start seeding everybody, you can still download even if you seed. So please, get a goal, ""i will seed to 10gb"" ""i will seed to 5gb"", whatever you want, then just do it. Do not be so fucking selfish fokes.

,dzw021,2008-04-11T03:33Z,"Thanks a ton Bamprod-

To those that are still working through this game, here are a few tips from the previous comments - READ BEFORE PLAYING:

(1) DISK 1 AIRSHIP FREEZE - If you are using epsxe 1.6.0, your game will freeze here. To get around it, just use version 1.5.2. You can save the game after the airship animation and go back to 1.6.0 if you want, but 1.5.2 works just as well as 1.6.0 anyways.
(2) DISK 3 BATTLE FREEZE - Certain battles will freeze. It is not the emulator; the disk 3 in this torrent is messed up. Download a working disk 3 at emuparadise.com"
,markalot84,2008-04-14T00:15Z,"God damn it !!! I'm stuck on DISK 3 at the kuja's palace....everytime I encounter an enemy who casts sleep it doesn't even freeze....there's just nothing happening at all. Even after bypassing all those crappy moments, there goes the same problem with the boss, some kinda big rocky monument, idunowat, i cant bypass it because it casts thundaga at the begining of the fight every time I try....

I guess the CD3 is fucked up....any1 didn't have this problem please help me I wanted this game so bad and now it sucks..."

,markalot84,2008-04-15T00:35Z,"Okay since no one answered my plea I had to find a solution all by myself and I think you might enjoy reading this comment before downloading this torrent.
- Some say the game will run fine and it's true only until Kuja's palace on disk 3. (with ePSXe 1.5.2)
-After downloading another final fantasy 9 for the psx I can now continue my game which I previously savestated and it worked just fine
-So here's the link to the other working final fantasy 9 if you encounter the same problem as I did on disk 3.

,yourwelcome6006,2008-04-26T06:17Z,"For those whose game freezes in the cut scene of cargo ship you are most likely using epsxe160. You can easily fix this by downloading an older version of epsxe( epsxe152). Make sure you save state using the emulator, not the ingame save, in epsxe160. Then copy ALL the files in the sstate folder of epsxe160 into the sstate folder of epsexe152. Finally load state on epsxe152 and the game will not freeze in the cut scene. This is a very quick way to get past the freeze without having to download another torrent. If you have any questions regarding this problem send me an email at illusion6006@gmail.com. (=  "

Thank you in advance."
,Prodigygamer1289,2008-09-27T05:45Z,"Two things.
1- Here are some problems ive encountered and how to fix them. These are for ePSXe

-no battle menu:
On the main epsxe menu-thing go to config-video-configure. I think about halfway down theres a option called ""off screen drawing"". set that to level 2. Just for the record. im using Pete's D3D Driver 1.77 plugin.

-freeze when taking off from dali.
change to ePSXe version 1.52 thats all. to change the save files berween versions just copy and paste these files from your old version into version 1.52: wherever your epsxe files are there should be two folders called ""sstates"" and ""memcards"" (i think) just copy and paste the files to version 1.52. although you might only need to copy and paste one of them but i forgot.

thats actually all my problems...huh...thought i had more... anyway

heres my question....kinda makes me feel stupid...how do you change to disc 2? :PPP its just a black screen :P
