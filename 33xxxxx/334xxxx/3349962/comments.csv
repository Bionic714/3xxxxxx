,reichert,2005-06-29T07:29Z,..any more details....?
,rci,2005-06-29T11:34Z,"yep, this weapon haarp is verry dangerous for humanity! http://educate-yourself.org/mc/mctotalcontrol12jul02.shtml"
,reichert,2005-06-30T02:46Z,"...Whoo, Now I know.... many different functions including:

1. controlling the weather,
2. mind control,
3. behavior and mood control, and
4. sending synthetic-telepathy as infrasound to victims with US government mind-control implants. 

Vaccine Implants
Implants are now smaller than a hair's width and are injected with vaccine and flu shots. Millions have had this done unknowingly. These 'biochips' circulate in the bloodstream and lodge in the brain, enabling the victims to hear 'voices' via the implant. There are many kinds of implants now and 1 in 40 are victims from 'alien abduction' statistics, though 1 in 20 has also been gauged.  The fake alien abduction event, revealed to be actually the work of  US military personnel using technology to make hologram spaceships outside, virtual reality scenarios of going onto a spaceship with humans in costumes, has been astutely perceived. Though real alien abductions do occur, the 'alien abduction' scenario has been useful to stop any further investigation or accountability of government  authorities by poor victims who would face mockery and appear silly."

,gregorius,2005-06-30T20:40Z,"and please, don't tell me that haarp has not much to do with ufos, i know that since about 10 years! and btw, i heard something like if haarp has been sold to a private corp recently....does anyone know?"
