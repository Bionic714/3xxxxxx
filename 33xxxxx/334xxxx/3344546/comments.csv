,Lerre,2005-06-16T00:53Z,"O M G
How could anyone be stupid enough to upload a russian version of a movie? Jesus! It's exactly like all those spanish dubs. Dumbasses who don't read the descriptions start dling it, and they do it for nothing. Most people don't bother reading the entire description, spoken language and such, so in the future write it in the description to avoid confusion that apparently has struck alot of people (although it's not so hard to read the entire description)."

1. It's in Rusky

2. It's pretty fair quality

The ongoing tit for tat seems pointless.

Does anyone have something PRACTICAL to contribute - like the guys with the idea to play the audio from a crappy copy with the video of the decent Russ copy?

Has anyone been able to combine/sync English audio yet with a decent copy?

,DaB0mb0,2005-06-29T17:18Z,"From what I gather this torrent is in Russian. IMO it's a great movie. I was never into batman and the whole concept, but the special effects, plot, casting, audio... everything fell together in this movie, and it's well worth 5 bucks to go out and see it in theater. Really you shouldn't spoil it by seeing it in a language you don't understand..."
