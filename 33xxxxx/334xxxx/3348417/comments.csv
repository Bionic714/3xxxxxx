,SteinIP,2005-08-02T16:01Z,"Patch didnt cut it for me... Got a complaint that CRC check failed, which 'could' indicate that the .exe file was tampered with... :("
,trogar,2006-01-23T18:01Z,"Further inspection shows that if you choose base options, then run the exe file again after the error, then the program seems to work. For those with the same problem, just run the exe again, and all should work just fine."
,MickDagger,2006-01-24T17:54Z,"CRC file checking and such.. oh my, how confusing.   Thanks to trogar for the clue to make it Just Work."
