Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith

Based on an ISO file with frame counter strip dl'd from here with wrong horizontal:vertical screen size, this avi was adjusted to correct anamorphic size as intended, and 4 overlappings were deleted, the frame counter still marrs the top part of the screen. To archive it, you need to burn it to a DVD data disk, as the size is around 2 gig, or chop it into 3 CD size chunks with Nandub (has variable bitrate mp3, not handled well with VirtualDub or VirtualDubMod).

May the dark side of the force be with with you until the DVD surfaces.
