,Xorlon,2005-06-26T17:27Z,"Ruskigt dåligt av TPB att inte ha en funktion för torrent-skaparen att kunna redigera sin torrent =/

Jag har folk som laddar upp ifrån mig, men det verkar som om tracker infon (http://tracker.prq.to/announce) har råkat få ett mellanslag framför och därför inte fungerar.
Torrenten går dock att ladda ner, så seed FINNS."
,Xorlon,2005-06-26T17:30Z,"Hursomhelst, ni som tankar denna och använder ett program där man kan ändra trackern, ta bort mellanslaget före  http://tracker.prq.to/announce"
,Xorlon,2005-06-26T17:32Z,"Change tracker to:
http://tracker.prq.to/announce
Instead of:
http://tracker.prq.to/announce (a blank spot before the Url, which makes some programs to fail in getting trackerinfo. The torrent works however."
,Xorlon,2005-06-27T10:58Z,"Modarna är bara att extrahera upp, å lägga i Max Payne foldern (där du installerat spelet) sen så väljer man bara modarna vid spelstarten (Finns en bar tär man kan välja bland installerade mods) Simple as it is ;)"

,Jeff_The_Ninja,2005-08-06T03:08Z,how come this torrent is bigger than the other Max Payne Torrent?

Mate just having some problems with the torrent when i try running the MaxPayne file it says:

'The application has failed to start because rlmfc.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.'

If anyone can help me out with this problem or getting the game to work in general that would be sweet..

Thnx Masden"

,Xorlon,2007-06-19T19:34Z,"You don't need to registrate the game, in fact: don't.

Just install, apply the patch and copy the crack. Install mods if u want them, after that it's just to play."

,Spollero,2008-08-04T00:44Z,"Works perfectly on my XP. (Dunno about this torrent, had downloaded it before. Now I'm downloading again.)"
,Spollero,2008-08-04T00:48Z,"To install.
First get daemon tools and install.
Then mount the image and install the game.
Then use the patch to update the game.
After that un zip the NOCD zip and put the .exe file to the directory where you installed max payne (default C:/program files/max payne)
then you can install the mods, but it's not neccessary and/or you can do it later.
Now you can enjoy the great game."

,c0rnd0g1234,2008-10-19T07:30Z,"Downloading the game and playing it are easy. If it requires a CD to play then all you do is download all files to wherever you want, then burn the launcher only to a cd and thats it, when you put in the cd, it will run the game and you can then play it. same goes for pretty much every other game out there"
,c0rnd0g1234,2008-10-19T07:32Z,"if it does not need a cd, then find the launcher and run it to start the game, if any other error occurs, either you did something wrong in downloading, or you need a patch."

,rapmusicunderstood,2009-09-09T00:36Z,"Hi everyone. For those of you that cannot figure out how to use this torrent, you have to mount the image files on Daemon Tools. Download that either with torrents, or get the trial version. It's very simple to use, you just import your image file, and it runs it like it's on a cd. Install the game and enjoy. As for your nocd problem, you have to get a no cd/dvd patch. You can find it on www.gamecopyworld.com It's simple. Just search your game, find you nocd patch, choose a mirror, and download. Once it's done, replace you original (whatever game).exe with the one you downloaded. It's that simple! "

""abnormal program termination""

on Vista
any suggestions?"
[V],Iznogoud9,2011-02-19T10:13Z,"Max Payne is not entirely Vista compatible. The cutscenes and the graphic novels don't have any sound on Vista.

However, there's a fix (I tried it and it works):

http://www.helderpinto.com/blog/personal/max-payne-1-windows-vista-easy-sound-fix.html

Also, the game sound effects were broken on my first try. Running the exe in compatibility mode for 98/ME fixed the sounds.
