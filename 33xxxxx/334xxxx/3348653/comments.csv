,Ravenlord_X,2005-06-26T00:29Z,"Hmmm, i tried it out, but it never once hided my IP number...Sad but true :("
,Burkbirra,2005-06-26T00:32Z,Very strange! How did you make the test? Did you have any other browser than Internet Explorer?
,Burkbirra,2005-06-26T00:38Z,"Tested against 6 other ""Find my IP"". Now it's a total of almost twenty different websites, all claiming that they can find my real IP, that hasn't been able to do their job."
,Ravenlord_X,2005-06-26T00:39Z,"Never mind my first coment:)..Cahnged some proxys and sim sala bim, i worked:) THANX for this Burkbirra.."

,bejjo,2005-06-26T01:23Z,Say Hi to the FBI from Me!
,popova,2005-06-26T08:32Z,Fungerar med bredband eller nej ? tack
,Burkbirra,2005-06-26T09:20Z,Bredband? Största delen av de som tankar ned filmer på PB har 56K-modem...ELLER?
,Ravenlord_X,2005-06-26T09:40Z,"Hehehehe, sitter inte ni också med dial up modem?? "
,Zicostar,2005-06-26T16:28Z,Nice! I am a arab...
,xecom_4,2005-06-26T17:35Z,funkar den med bit lord??
,Burkbirra,2005-06-26T20:30Z,Tror till 99% att den funkar med alla bittorrentprogram. Här är en idé: prova!
,Burkbirra,2005-06-26T20:51Z,"By writing ""the other IP:s"" I mean the ones you get when Hide-IP is running and you visit the website. I had to explain this because I'm shure some half-brain....PERSON sooner or later would post that question."
,Erfa,2005-06-27T07:49Z,"Fungerar hur bra som helst. Lite konstigt packat, though, så det får väl räcka med en fyra."
,IceMaster,2005-06-30T03:35Z,"Of course, it's not possible for your IP to be completely secure.  It has to be in the packet headers when transmitting over the internet.  If it's not, it's like replying to a letter with no return address; You will receive no data.  Ever.  And if you do, then your real IP is out there telling it where to go."
,Burkbirra,2005-07-03T21:49Z,Downloading is illegal in Sweden since 050701. That's the reason for me wanting to be anonymous and for that reason this application works fine. I've combined it with PeerGuardian and there's no conflicts or slowing down of my system. Don't know if the latter is necessery but what the hell...
,flygsvamp,2005-07-07T20:49Z,"I tried the program with www.ipchicken.com and it said: host-148-244-150-58.block.alestra.net.mx and that is SO far away from my true IP. This program works. Period. I believe the problems with getting this program to work is not inside the computer, rather in front of it. "
,Hednoize,2005-08-11T11:23Z,the sites are made for the users' convenience of getting his/her own ip. it's not made to grab your ip against your will. so just cause these sites doesnt show the true ip doesn't mean this software hides your ip from somone who really wants to get it..
,kasperkula,2006-08-03T22:26Z,Is it legale to use this kind of programs?
