Release Notes:

City Sleeps is 5-piece rock band from Atlanta, GA. They signed to
Maverick/Warner in 2004. This is their upcoming, untitled full
length disc, many months early.  Talks have surrounded naming the
album 'Walker's Ridge', which in my opinion is an excellent
choice. The record was produced by John Feldmann (Goldfinger,
Story of the Year, The Used).  We decided to tag 2005 even though
the plans are to release it sometime in January 2006.  Enjoy a
killer sound from a talented band. Be sure to check out their 
myspace page.   www.myspace.com/citysleeps 

Look for them in the future,they are going to be huge!
