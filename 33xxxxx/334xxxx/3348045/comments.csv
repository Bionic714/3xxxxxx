,Tibber,2005-06-28T20:16Z,"Sorry about the double post, dont know what happened."
,wackjob,2005-06-28T22:16Z,"I mounted the image in Alcohol 120% before I upped it-worked fine, send me a PM"
,Da-Rock,2005-07-01T00:15Z,Setup states its missing the Assaulttm_code.exe
,Da-Rock,2005-07-03T09:52Z,"Hello again,

Setup now works, but the game requires the DVD and the mounted image doesn't work due to the file in a file etc....."
,wackjob,2005-07-05T12:21Z,"Well, let's try it this way (what a total WTF this turned out to be!)

****some guy's 'method'****

Ok, Lets start this from the begining. 

First off I mounted the image on alcohol 120%, Opened the folder inside and hit the setup button. ( Nothing happened.) wouldnt install. 

Then X gave me the fix for that {copy all files to hard drive and then install from there}, Which I thought I would cheat and create a data dvd with One's. When Burned I proceeded to install from the dvd [ which it did} to my usual place for games. D: Games. ,,, I never install games to my C: Programs drive.
Then When I tried to play it I got the msg please insert original dvd.
Tried to crack it with everything i could find.. Eventually I uninstalled it and re-installed it to my C: programs Directory.
Got a backup cd crack and Voila... Perfect. except it crashes now and again as I think my pc specs are not up to it. { Graphic card } Nvidea FX5700 ultra.

Anyway. it now works. 


*****

Hope that helps"
