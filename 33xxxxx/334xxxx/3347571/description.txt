Volume 12 of the "Have a Nice Day" series is one of the sillier, more inconsistent discs in the collection, but the good songs are so strong that they make the weaker offerings tolerable. Blue Swede's massively successfull remake of B J Thomas' "Hooked on a Feeling" sets the tone, ably assisted by Bill Stafford's "Spiders and Snakes" and Ray Stevens' "The Streak." But don't make the mistake of thinking this is a comedy collection! Rick Derringer's "Rock 'n Roll Hootchie Koo" and David Essex' "Rock On" are powerful mainstream rockers, while Mocedades adds a beautiful downtempo ballad in "Eres Tu." Sister Janet Mead's "The Lord's Prayer" and Stealers Wheel's "Star" are more than a bit out of place here, but do little to detract from the overall appeal of the disc.

This is one of the few really strong Volumes in the series and does just fine as a stand alone, despite it's overall light-hearted tone. Highly recommended.
