This is George's first solo guitar recording as the soundtrack to this film which was narrated by Liv Ullmann. It is a story about a young Japanese girl who has become a heroine of peace... If any one have this and could share this with us.  "
,movie.hard,2006-09-04T13:52Z,"the file is fake, looks like a scam... If any one write a comment, he deletes quickly the torrent, looks he does not want some one to see... Be warned!"

I mean, what are the chances someone's going to upload The Velveteen Rabbit and fill it with viruses or something? Think about it. It's The Velveteen Rabbit for christ's sake! Even if it did have viruses, they'd be happy little viruses that'd only make your computer feel warm and fuzzy all over!"
