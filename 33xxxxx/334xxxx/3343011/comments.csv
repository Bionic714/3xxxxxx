,Finatic,2005-06-13T04:09Z,"many thanks for this torrent.  i have to admit that i have no experience with BIN/QUE file systems.  can anyone take a moment to let me and others know how to open these files up?

thanks in advance."
,EL_REY666,2005-06-13T21:05Z,"if you have NERO you can butn them quite easy :

1) open NERO, close any wizard or compilation thing that comes up

2)go to the top, and click on RECORDER, on the drop down menu, choose BURN IMAGE [it will look for iso, nrg, and cue files]

3)find where ever you saved these files to, start with disc 1, and select your CUE file...burn window will popup, check the info[disc 1 has 15 audio tracks], then click BURN

4)to burn disc 2, do the same steps,  but now look for the NRG file, same process[disc 2 has 6 audio and 1 data track] click burn

5) burn disc 3, look for the CUE file in the disc 3 folder, check info[1 data track], click burn

should be easy, and enjoy the ""best of maiden"" and thier video game"
