Classic Games Collection #1

In short: This is a remix of hillem616's "old pc games" torrent. I've taken out the duplicates, the crappier games, the non working archives and the few viruses that i found, renamed everything, sorted it by year, added a ton more games and utilities, including dosbox and ScummVM. I've also repacked everything to cut the file size down further, changes a few versions around and minimised the amount of work you have to do to actually play these games.
