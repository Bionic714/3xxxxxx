,your666,2005-06-11T06:18Z,"after watching this, I've decided to upload it in one disc, there's just too much on the dvd (seriously, there's like 60 chapters) there's and it's a bit of a hassle to navigate through it without the menus. Plus the menus are really, really nice. Anyway, it's easy enough to make your own discs with dvd shrink."
,your666,2005-06-11T06:19Z,"sorry, i fergot to say I'll be posting the first disc tommorow afternoon."
,mpee,2005-07-25T10:06Z,your666 could you upload that 2 disc version of dvd1?
,your666,2005-07-26T21:49Z,"nope.
I don't use piratebay anymore, too many crap users. I only use asiandvdclub.org, sure it's only asian dvd's but if you don't share, you can't download."
