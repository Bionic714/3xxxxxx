This utility allows native explorer viewing of Canon and Nikon (NEF) RAW files as well as other standard image formats (TIFF, BMP, GIF, PNG, JPEG etc.).  The utility is split into a Windows XP shell extension which provides preview / edit / print commands for RAW files as well as a RAW viewer application.
