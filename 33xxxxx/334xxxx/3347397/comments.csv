,HowHe,2005-06-22T18:06Z,For crying out loud can anyone seed it? Its really cool if he did get the hold of the eBay source code. Not that I believe he did but who knows.
,joes106,2005-06-23T06:37Z,"For crap sake, it's only 7mb. Someone should have it by now and seeding it."
,JT20,2005-06-23T22:28Z,"what is it?

,Rapid Dr3am,2005-06-24T00:10Z,"It's the ebay source code.

The code that powers ebay.com"

,crazy2be,2008-02-04T01:22Z,"wow, what do you do with this? so many files...
it's amazing how small it is. not like ms.:)"
,MikeGTS,2008-03-23T04:32Z,"This stuff is very old, old enough not to be useful anymore. At least we know how much money hackers made back then, too bad eBay improved in security after Vladuz fucked them in the ass."
,outlawguy89,2009-07-28T15:10Z,"Lol, this is going to take forever.  I usually don't seed do to my crappy internet, but I will definitely seed this."
,cm0nster6,2011-02-15T09:08Z,cuz all the code powering a site like ebay only takes up 7 mb's...yeah
,physixmaster,2011-02-17T00:31Z,"@cm0nster6
Well yeah. If you have every coded a website you would know that 50 odd php pages ain't gonna take up that much space, there just essentially text docs. 
Why did you feel the overwhelming urge to A) consider yourself, with no knowledge an expert and B) Use this non-existant knowledge as a basis for your comment."
