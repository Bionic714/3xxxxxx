DARNA is no more!

BRAGUDA holds AIO hostage, but to her astonishment, no DARNA comes to AIO's rescue.

Meanwhile, MOLECULA has lost her humanity and has been taken over by the alien creatures who reanimated her from the dead. DARK MOLECULA is born!

DARK MOLECULA wreaks havoc upon the city of Manila, murdering its denizens mercilessly. VALENTINA watches in disbelief, as indeed no DARNA comes to their rescue.

EFREN and NARDA have troubles of their own. After surviving a plane crash headed for a supposed romantic interlude, they now face danger in a remote far-flung island.

Who will now save the city? Is this how all wild end? Has BRAGUDA won?
