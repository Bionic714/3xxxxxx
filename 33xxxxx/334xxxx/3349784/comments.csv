,Temptation,2005-07-11T14:01Z,"Israel's ""war of independence"" ..?!  Come on.. give me fucking break..  As if they were freeing themselves from a colonial power or something.  More like ""Israel's War of Conquest"",  and subsequent occupation of Palestinian land and subsequent oppression and murder of the Palestinian people that has continued to this day.

If the Palestinians fight and get their land back, including Israel itself, from the Zionist colonialists and Jews who stole the Palestinians' land, kicked them out, and massacred them, then THAT would be a War of Independence.  "

,leemo,2007-06-22T00:49Z,"TTOW - don't bother, temptation and the other lib/left/looneys know it all...the joos and america are the great satan, and the muslim brotherhood will save the world - - hehe - - they really believe it too."
,E___-._.-___3,2007-07-22T12:43Z,"Well, as a matter of fact, 'Temptation' is correct, but what would I know - I'm only studying for my masters degree in history.  In that context, I did quite a bit of research in order to discuss the reasons why the U.S.A. has no choice but to support Israel.  The results were amazing."
