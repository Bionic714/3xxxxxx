Game 5 (June 19) of the 2005 NBA Finals from an NHK Japan TV broadcast. Captured using MPEG-2 (NTSC, 720 X 480, 60 Hz, 4:3) and AC3 compression.

 English audio with a little commentary and text in Japanese

 Finally a great game played on both ends of the court by both teams. If you wanna see stars who choke (Duncan, Hamilton) and a role player who does it again (Big Shot Rob), then this whopper of an iso image is for you.

 Enjoy watching the whole kitten-kaboodle, from Kid Rock to the end of overtime.
