,saamoa,2005-06-29T10:25Z,"jeez, david 'the artist formerly known as tibet' really need to release some new stuff.
He can't keep feeding us with these reissues and pop one extra track on to tempt us to buy it once again (i have both the vinyl and the cd)

Anyways, still need to listen to 'How I Devoured Apocalypse Balloon' I downloaded that a week ago or so :o)"
