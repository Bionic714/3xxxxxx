Start your engines and hang on as you take on tight corners down alleyways and in the open field. Zip your way through 10 wild and crazy tracks from villages, garages, parking lots, racetracks, to the town center. Master your Mini as you learn to use your handbrakes, accelerate, and burn out. There is no limit to your ambition as you compete with your rivals.
