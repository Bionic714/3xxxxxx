Drawing on inspiration from artists like Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Massive Attack and Talk Talk Pole Folder has strived to maintain a common theme behind the tracks on the album, and this is reflected in the consistent and very predominant idea that it is sometimes that what we fear shapes our decisions, and motivates the purpose rather than our desires. 

'Zero Gold' is not simply a dance album. It is a carefully crafted work, grounded in timeless musical concepts, stellar production and genuinely felt artistic presence. It acknowledges its influences without parodying them and is ultimately an expression of the artist's endeavour played out through the use of modern technologies and musical techniques. 

Enjoy!
