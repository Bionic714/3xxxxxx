,zZzerk,2005-06-28T23:45Z,"hmm... sometimes I wonder if these weird debunk flicks are made by the same side that gets debunked pretending to be te other side, to make them look even worse... if you get my drift."
,dirtmound,2005-06-29T02:27Z,Don't be retarded. Michael Moore is about as smart as a bag of hammers. 
,phonkyd3jv,2005-06-29T10:45Z,"haha come on, not this argument again... michael moore is for people who can't read, so if you don't read, don't comment either, just be happy that he does what he does to get trough to you folks."
,gregorius,2005-06-30T21:32Z,"9/11? you say that america has been lied to about the cause of 9/11? you are totally right...and it was not mr. moore who made this clear to me, but a documentary called '911 in plane site' - just watch this, the first part about the 'pentagon plane' is so evident, you don't even need to watch the rest, where one can always say: 'yes, but i cannot see this because of the quality of the movie document - so i prefer to believe in the official version the government tells us...' - but as i said, for the part with the pentagon plane it's so obvious, no doubt possible at all and when the society of civil engineers brings out a report in 2003 i think, about the case pretending things from that they only can exactly know they are wrong and they sell this to be the truth, i wonder why they can do it! i have seen dozens about it but there's none like this '911 in plane site'! but, another question: how many bombs were there in oklahoma? what do you think? hahahaha...the whole story began very much earlier!"
,gregorius,2005-06-30T21:43Z,and...you know the best? you can even find it on pirate bay! this site is the best!!

as you can see the votes are very black and white, i find this most peculiar becouse the real problem are ofcoarse extreem opinions ;)

btw this documentary is by my opinion one long and kinda boring Michael Moore bashing and just plain sad coz it holds very little facts and a lot of ""deny deny deny"" ..and i never heard the name ""Michael Moore"" this many times in 80 minutes.
in fact i will almost have to agree with zZzerk on this documantery."
