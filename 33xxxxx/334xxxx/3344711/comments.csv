,axonal,2006-11-23T11:41Z,"The iLok reset script looks quite suspicious...  I'm not sure if I'd want it doing something like this:

,konero,2007-04-17T02:21Z,Has anyone successfully used the ilok reset script?
,moronthannot,2007-04-27T01:51Z,"I have tried to use the ilok reset torrent and it doesn't work...It will get rid of the ilok files on the cpu, but doesn't reset the trial period.  I've tried over and over again...maybe there's a hidden trick to it that I may not know about."
,gigicarlo,2007-04-27T23:23Z,"Hi there

,zootvd,2007-10-07T17:44Z,"Has anyone gotten this to work?

I have a UB MBP machine and every time I've tried to install it, the installer has crashed. Could someone please fix this? Whenever I search for a waves torrent, they're literally ALL PC...there's gotta be someone with a Mac version somewhere...."
,leggomyyayo,2007-10-18T08:08Z,seriously does anyone know how to get this thing to work?  It has a challenge code we have to respond to and i dont know what that is about.  
,lazymark,2007-10-30T18:27Z,"Oh lord wont you crack a version of Waves for mac for me?

,wsnzd,2008-04-11T02:23Z,"just fyi, i performed the following steps, as root, in terminal:

rm -r /TheVolumeSettingsFolder/HFSExtentTables/
rm -r /Desktop\ DB
rm -r /Desktop\ DF

and then rebooted .. and when i went to run Max/MSP, my trial period was reset - hurrah. dunno if it will work with Waves though."
,zackg007,2008-05-04T21:12Z,"wsnzd,
I dont really understand whatyou did could you be more explicit? I'd like to try it. am I supposed to delete those files? am I supposed to enter that info somewhere, what do you mean to do exactly?"
,jazzinaz,2008-06-08T06:19Z,The torrent works great! If you can not understand the crack then you should be playing on www.barney.com instead. Stop bitching people. Jesus Christ its free. The demo runs for 14 days then all you have to do is reset the script then restart. 
,caynick,2008-06-08T20:05Z,"thanks skagab!

now without any shitty comments can anyone explain how to do this? recently switched to mac so no idea

many thanks

,hoolieshkr,2009-01-20T03:04Z,Do you need an ilok USB key for this?
,ghgjgk,2009-01-30T15:50Z,"This versions old, we need something newer, is anyone able to write a challenge/response keygen for waves/ maxmsp/cubase 4 (all programs that use an ilok?

The Ilok reset instructions basically doesn't explain anything properly. They don't tell you what the program does, they don't tell you whether you actually need an iLok or whether its a ""cracked"" (software) iLok installed on the system.

I've heard that you do need an iLok to use newer waves versions, so i just bought myself one, and installed waves, then i ran the iLok reset in the hope that it would somehow help! lol does absolutely nothing.

The Plugins are asking for (on manual activation) a response code to a particular challenge code.
I don't know how this works, whether the challenge response code then talks to the server and checks if its a real code (I HOPE NOT LOL), or whether the challenge/response activates the product by checking it with a number of responses stored in the program, but to be fair what we need is a Keygen, that will do a challenge/response activation. The Ilok reset does absolutely nothing. Basically the problem lies in the unavailability of serial numbers, if everybody complaining about not having waves on mac would buy an iLok and someone would write one of these keygens, then we would all (hopefully) have waves/ max msp / cubase 4/ etcetcetc working. I don't understand why this hasn't already been done, and why there is this iLok reset thing going around which doesn't actually activate any of the programs, and actually causes damage to your system files!"

,rox970,2009-08-08T06:20Z,yes it works!! 1st off it wont work on 10.5! but after you load waves you'll have 14 days to use it  completely in demo mode..Once your trial is over open up the ilok  reset script (the paper looking thing with a script on it) and press on the run button...it'll ask for admin password..put in your password and hit ok 6 times you should see trial has reset logout and once you log out and back in you have another 14days to use it.
