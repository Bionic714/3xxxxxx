,uvrt,2005-06-17T12:01Z,This fucking doesn't work!!! I checked with www.ipchicken.com and it can still track my IP. FUCK! ASSHOLES
,shinmai,2005-06-17T12:26Z,How stupid are you? How could a  windows program somehow magically hide your IP address? You obviously have no clue about networking.. Use a proxy server for your connections to hide your IP...
,Jefke,2005-06-18T19:32Z,"How could that be? Well, shinmai-MORON... Just like you said.  Hide IP's website says:
""Hide IP will find the proxy server available to you and set it as your proxy server automatically. There is nothing need you to concern. Hide IP have done everything for you! "".  
This is technically possible.  You obviously have no clue about programming."

,flygsvamp,2005-07-07T20:46Z,"I tried the program with www.ipchicken.com and it said: host-148-244-150-58.block.alestra.net.mx and that is SO far away from my true IP. This program works. Period. I believe the problems with getting this program to work is not inside the computer, rather in front of it."
