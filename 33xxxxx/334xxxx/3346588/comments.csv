,Mongoid,2005-06-22T14:12Z,"Ungrateful Bastages......thanks n20, I wanted to try this one out. Am seeding natch :-)"
,Mikaeru,2005-06-22T19:39Z,"Men eftersom Piratebay är internationell(har du märkt alla utländska användare som finns här? eller kanske att sidan är skriven på engelska som standard? Att det finns flera språkinställningar?) så skriver jag på engelska för att så många som möjligt ska kunna läsa det jag skriver. Alla andra förstår inte ditt språk när di går in på en sida eller ännu vanligare, ett online spel eller något annat sånt.
Jag har själv blivit irriterad mer än en gång på folk som spelar online spel och går fram till en och frågar något på italienska. ""My good english isn't"" eller något sånt är ingen bra anledning. Det finns gott om folk som skriver på engelska trots att dom inte är bra på det."
,Arabking,2005-06-22T19:46Z,"nice game, thx for the upload n20"

,NzKiwi,2005-07-05T10:28Z,It needs to be modded with a chip to play copied/imported/pirated games.
