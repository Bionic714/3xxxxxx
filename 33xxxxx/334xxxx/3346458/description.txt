This ain't a normal documentary, it is the actual footage shot by the american military for "Operation Crossroads", the first in a long line of post WWII nuclear bomb tests.

The narrated footage contains the ABLE (01 July 1946) and BAKER (25 July 1946) shots, the 4th and 5th atomic bomb explosions in the history of mankind (the first 3 were Trinity, Hiroshima and Nagasaki).

The footage offers fascinating insights for those interested in the subject.
