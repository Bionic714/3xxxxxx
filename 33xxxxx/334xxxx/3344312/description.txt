The Game

The high octane, free wheeling insanity that is Trackmania returns to PC CDROM. Trackmania Sunrise takes everything that made the original an instant online classic – amazing speed, ultra competitive multiplayer races and easily accessible tools to create and distribute outrageous tracks – and still manages to add more and more.

New sports cars that burn up the highways at a breathtaking 400kph as they tear around gorgeous new environments including the beauty of the Pacific Coast. The most insane stunt blocks ever, send perilous track building to a whole new level with sweeping bends, winding tunnels and ramps designed to send you soaring. Two new play modes – Platform and Crazy – mean that even the most experienced of trackmaniacs will face a totally fresh racing experience.

A new day has dawned… are you up for the challenge?
