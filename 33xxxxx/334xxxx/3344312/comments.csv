,Rs--,2005-06-14T00:53Z,Virker denne uten å gjøre noe spesielt? Bare å brenne ut?
,horlaci,2005-06-14T20:07Z,"Is this version with crack? Or still the same ""use external device"" stuff?"
,TEA-Time,2005-06-15T02:07Z,"Ummm...  You'd think people would learn not to hit Refresh and answer Yes to resubmit the data after posting a comment... ;-)

Anyway, I just compared this torrent to the last one that's still plenty active and they're the same except for the added Readme.nfo from MAD-Torrents.

Thanks for nuthin' wesuzuki!"
,KaKistoZ,2005-06-15T09:14Z,"When are uploaders gonna learn... *SIGH!* It really blows needing to search the entire net for serial after a download. Nowadays one ASSUMES that a serial follows the image, but NOOOO, this one is without. Great job bonzo. Give you a tip: next time add a keygen or at least a serial to make ur torrent more attractive. For frustated souls, I've looked up a serial for youz: KRXM DXGX CNX4 BNXF WJJ. It worxx just fine... ;)"
,Razorjack187,2005-06-15T14:53Z,"Anybody downloaded this know if this is cracked or do i have to mess about with daemon tools again? , last one i downloaded i couldnt get to work kept tellin me cd key was wrong."
,iNFESTED,2005-06-17T10:33Z,"Det är ju samma gamla skit med extern cd och hela köret. Vadfan kan man inte skriva med det i beskrivningen för?

Grr! Det går utför för TPB! :("

,cheater895,2005-07-25T07:32Z,"This game dont need usb drive for work.
I made allmost blank cd and named it TMSUNRISE.
Cd check was ok. I need a cd key/ activation key

,TEA-Time,2005-07-25T20:08Z,"Try these:

KRxM-DXGX-CNX4-BNXF-WJJ

YAT7-CPDX-K3HK-JNXX-CK5"
,TEA-Time,2005-07-25T20:11Z,Be aware that's two keys.  Note the space between the two.  TPB's message posting carelessly screws up any formatting you try to put into a comment.
,cheater895,2005-07-25T22:51Z,I need cdkey not online key???
,TEA-Time,2005-07-26T08:32Z,"Since I haven't seen mention of an actual CD key, my brain tells me that if what you did was going to work, it wouldn't be asking for a key.  Sorry, but that's just common sense."
,alip,2005-07-31T03:43Z,Does this fucking shit work? U stupid sweden shits star fucking writing in english u stupid fucks!!!!
,arnel88,2005-08-01T13:54Z,"what is that file that should be deleted? didn't understand that part. Done everything right exept for that, and no it stands that I have to insert cd when I try to start the game, even when I have the one i burned in the cd-rom"
,mr.oddity,2005-08-02T18:44Z,"I'm trying to find a way to run this from my 256mb mp3 player (usb). I've made a mini-image of the downloaded iso file, and it's size is only 23mb. The problem is that I don't know how to put the mini-image onto the player.. Any ideas? "
,TEA-Time,2005-08-02T21:00Z,"@alip, does your Mommy and Daddy know you're using their AOL account?  Now stop embarrassing yourself and go to bed like a good little boy.  Btw, I'm American, I don't speak or write Swedish, and even I think you're a SCHMUCK."
,Weeberzox,2005-08-09T08:17Z,">alip<
calm down fo fock sake!!"
,Roadtrip,2005-08-09T12:29Z,i have found the NO-CD patch For Trackmania Sunrise and i will make it a torrent ;)
,TEA-Time,2005-08-10T10:20Z,"Ok, that shouldn't take very long.  Where is it?? :)  Btw, try it first, because if it's from GameCopyWorld, you don't even need to bother.  It's for a completely different game, and they admit it themselves, but they've left it up there for months."
,moonraker66,2006-01-06T10:17Z,so the no cdkey was bogus or what??
