,GrandPaw,2005-06-12T03:22Z,Get errors when un-packing the last file
,MoonwalkerZ,2005-06-12T13:08Z,It works perfectly...
,Guitari,2005-06-12T15:44Z,"This file does work perfectly fine. You just have to know how to unpack it properly. As follows:

1)Open folder
2)Open BOTH archives @ same time
3)Drag the contents from each into the folder
4)Open the largest size archive and extract alcohol.zip.
4)Open alcohol.zip and extract contents.(Alcohol120_retail_1_9_5_2802.exe & crack.zip)
5)Take it from there."
