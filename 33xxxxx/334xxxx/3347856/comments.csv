,alidpr,2009-02-23T16:29Z,"Hi .. i hav d/loaded it in pc, but i dont see any setup file. It would be great help if you could tell me how to install ?"
[T],FaeGiN,2009-04-26T03:40Z,"Loo on thi sopage for how tio install it if you read the page.  There wil also, or should be in any case, a file in ther with it that you downloaded with the extension '.nfo'
that file is just a text file and it contains all the info you need to install the game.
You can right click an nfo file and choose 'open with...' in XP and then pick to open it with notepad.
But look at the bottom of the post on this page as it says it right here.
Here's a clue:
You will need:
Unrar is the first instruction.
So you need winrar or a similar program to open it.
You will then need a cd burning program.
I'll let you read the rest for yourself."
[T],FaeGiN,2009-04-26T03:41Z,"shit. Sorry about the million or so typos in the above post. It's late, I'm stoned and my eyesight is funny...hehehe"
[T],FaeGiN,2009-04-26T03:48Z,"Shit again.
I didn't just make typos, it's barely understandable as if English isn't my first language.
Hehe marijuana is a great tool.

Ok I feel guilty now so here's what you do:

1. You need to have WINRAR or a similar program installed.
2. You need to open the lowest numbered part file in winrar and then just press the EXTRACT button across the top of the window.
This will make the files for the game come out of the rar archives and into a folder on your PC.
3. You need to either, Burn these files to a CD OR you can mount the files to a 'fake cd drive' or Virtual drive if you are confident with that, it's simple really just install a program called daemontools or alcohol120%.
So if you burned a disc thats fine, if you mounted the files instead that is fine too...next step will still be the same:
4. You should get the autorun to install the game now. Install it and you are good to go.

Please, to make it easier for yourself in future, install something like Daemontools and do some googling to read up on it so you understand it.  It saves you burning CDs for thing you may not want to keep after testing them!"
