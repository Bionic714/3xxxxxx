Gokusen 2 | Japan 2005 | Drama/Comedy | 10 episodes | English softsubs

Gokusen 2 is a comedy/drama based on the manga of the same name. The basic story is about a young woman, Yankumi, whose parents died when she was young and she was raised by her grandfather. Her father was a teacher so it was her dream to grow up to be like him. Here's the catch: Her grandfather is the head of one of the most powerful old-school Yakuza families. And the hijinks ensue (most involve her slipping into her yakuza mannerisms at the wrong times, then having to talk her way out of it). Naturally, they stick her with the worst class in Japan, at an all boys high school, but she gradually earns their respect by either beating the crap out of them, or beating the crap out of others who beat the crap out of them.
