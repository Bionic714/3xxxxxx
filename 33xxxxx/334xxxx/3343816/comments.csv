,MacXtorrent,2005-06-13T03:41Z,"Die Fonts gibt es nur in 1 internationaler Version (ob da alle Zeichen drin sind, weiss ich nicht), die Sprachen dürften sich auf die Dokumentationen beziehen.

Weiss jemand was ""VAFAN ÄR DETTA"" heisst ?"
,Tierleben,2005-06-13T22:18Z,"I'm not very good at german but in english ""VAFAN ÄR DETTA"" becomes something along the lines of ""WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS"". By the way, ""fan"" means satan/the devil in swedish."
,Tierleben,2005-06-13T22:21Z,"P.S. Since the OpenType format supports more than 65000 characters, my guess is all swedish characters are supported."
,Tierleben,2005-07-09T16:40Z,"Oh, i forgot... I was right: all swedish characters (and a whole lot of others) are fully supported. And, by the way; these are VERY high quality fonts :) To make the most of them you will need proffesional typesetting software, though. Such as Adobe InDesign or Illustrator."

,olliewally255,2007-06-10T18:41Z,Is this in the truetype flavor of opentype?
,elvstone,2007-07-31T22:15Z,"Could anyone who has successfully used this file make a checksum of it (MD5 or SHA-1 or whatever). I mounted it as a hfsplus loopback device under Linux and tried to copy all .odt fonts in the Wester Fonts directory, but got input/output error on quite a few of the fonts. It would be nice to have a checksum so I could be sure that my download is complete (it probably is though)."
