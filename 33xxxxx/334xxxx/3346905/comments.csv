,Rajje,2005-06-22T23:17Z,"As far as I know, Adobe never releases their application multilaungaged. You will have to find a specific german version."

,macfreak,2005-07-09T19:36Z,"the download is slow, even though i have followed the firewall router instructions. maybe it's because we need more seeders? i'm new to bittorrent, so... if there's anything else i can do to make the downloads faster, let me know! thanks..."
,elvisknz,2005-07-09T20:35Z,please  . I need a Sn for this !
,Rajje,2005-07-10T22:54Z,"Hac: As said - this is a Mac app. Why are you downloading this if you have Windows?          

elvisknz: The same SN has worked for me several times. Actually I reinstalled the suite just three days ago and there were no problem with the third SN. You must be doing something wrong ... Sometimes it works better if you disconnect from internet. If you want to find other SNs, search Google for ""adobe cs2 mac sn"" or something and you will probably find them fast.          

macfreak: Try setting the upload speed limit to about 70 % of the total upload bandwidth of your connection. If you have ADSL2+ with 1 Mbit/s ul-speed, the ul-speed limit should be 70 kbit/s."
,tmb_MINION,2005-07-10T23:28Z,"Good S/Ns are found at www.seriall.com but there is a Windoze spyware (or virus, adrware, I dont know cause I use Mac) download that sneaks in. I told my Windoze friend about it and he caught the bug. But other than that it's a great place for serials."

,coeal1,2006-03-01T20:29Z,"olle,

I have the same problem.  As a temp fix, kick back your date to any time before mar. 1 before you open photoshop.  I think it expires today so as long as the system thinks it is before the expiration date, it will work.  Let me know if you find a real fix."
,eneshelon,2006-03-02T05:24Z,"this is what i read from someone else...

""Insert the CD1 begin the installation even if it's already installed, when asking for a serial number enter 1130-0461-9410-3121-4687-6592 and continue, the installer will then show you what you have already installed, just press quit to quit the installer and start Photoshop with the same old 1131 serial number, just answer the registration question and you're good to go... Don't know how long it will work though!

Just found it disable the Distiller and when you enter the old 1131 serial number to make Distiller to work Photoshop doesn't want to start.""

this fixes the serial expiration problem"

,Jake244,2007-01-22T19:30Z,Need seeders - this is painfully slow.  Come on there are so many of you out there... Thx
,localyokel,2007-02-06T23:28Z,"Downloaded this successfully, and seeded for a bit. I don't know what to do with the files now. The dmg files (disk images) won't open for me, and the rtf (rich text files) won't open either. People have posted installing this successfully, but I don't know how.

I've got a non-intel G5 iMac running 10.4.8 if it helps.

If anyone has advice, that would be great. I'd hate to have downloaded a 2 gig file for no reason."
,greg_2,2007-02-11T23:31Z,"It WILL work on an Intel proc, but will run through Rosetta.

Meaning that it was originally coded for PowerPC procs and must be recoded on the fly to Intel.

It will be slow for you Intel folk, but it's your only option for Photoshop until CS3 comes out.

Any Mac OS X program will run on Intel procs, but some that are not Universal, must be run through Rosetta (done automatically)."
,14180,2007-02-12T06:57Z,"Any idea why this WON'T work on Intel Macs?

Myself as well as other friends have tried, and it does not boot... ideas?"
,mac_davis,2007-02-26T23:33Z,Are you sure you denied access to the internet by the installer and applications?
,Sofioli,2007-03-01T08:12Z,"I cant open the rtf-file with the SN, not even with word...anyone who can help me? Please..."
,thaibuddha,2007-03-06T05:02Z,So what is the deal with the people who have downloaded this and are not sharing?? Remember.....sharing is caring!!
,covered in bees,2007-03-11T23:05Z,"Please pardon my paranoia, but what's the final word on installing this on an Intel Mac? I've got a MacBook Pro, running OSX v.10.4.8. Will it work fine or will my computer be fucked?

Thanx"

,millesh,2007-06-10T01:10Z,"hi everyone, can you help me here? its my first torrent and i cant understand why the download is not working. I have downloaded the program Bittorent and i have added as a torrent this file (by pasting the URL). Its been now 2 days that the file is still at 0.0% and the download bar is red. Can someone tell me what im doing wrong? thank you for the help"
,10-ekips,2007-06-12T15:02Z,I always download ALL torrents on a PC and create the CD's from Nero (and then load on a MAC).  This is the first time I have not been able to do so on the PC.  The MAC is not online and never will be as it is located VERY remotely (Can you say African Bush?).  How do I get it to save properly on the PC?
,andlabs,2007-06-28T22:41Z,Thanks for the file! It actually works (instead of the CS3 crack I got a few days ago). Do you plan on providing a CS3 just like this so I can use it on an Intel Mac?
,TechnoDude94,2007-08-02T14:53Z,Someone please SEED! Thank you. I am stuck at 68.1%. Please seed. I have been downloading for 1 week (6 day 4 hours). 
,TechnoDude94,2007-08-05T05:07Z,I just finished downloading it and I am seeding now. Installed the folder from my External USB HDD. Downloaded and copied the folder to HDD and installed it from there. Works perfectly on a Apple MacBook with 120GB HDD and 2GB RAM.

,graniteguy17,2008-02-29T18:42Z,"hey there people looking for serials... people can't post serials because thats a kind of incriminating thing to do.

But you can search for a program called ""Serial Box"" or ""iSerial Reader""

They'll have what you're looking for."
