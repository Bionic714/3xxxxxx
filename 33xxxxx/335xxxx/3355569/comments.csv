,DrunkenSquirrel,2005-08-06T21:32Z,This torrent thing is new to me. I got Bitlord and clicked the Download This Torrent button told it where to save and it says it is downloading. But is it? Or is the download rate that low that it is still at 0.0% after 5 minutes?
,DrunkenSquirrel,2005-08-06T22:02Z,Says download: 0 KB/s? hmm
,DrunkenSquirrel,2005-08-07T07:00Z,"Sorry, got it figured out. Wow been running for 9 hours and it just got to 25%... WOOW lol!"
,DrunkenSquirrel,2005-08-08T02:43Z,Yeah... it's done but nothing works... is this just 1.5 gigs of trash? How the heck do you make it go? Or is it incomatible with American computers?... I wouldn't think so...
,PerkaErka,2005-08-08T23:38Z,exactly how did u say that we changed the game language to english?
,DrunkenSquirrel,2005-08-09T08:04Z,"When I try to install it it either says it is invalid or it opens some kind of music installation program, is that used to install it? What directory must it link to? How did other people install this? Or did people just put this in the recycle bin after waiting 26 hours for the download? C'mon people who installed it! Help me out here!"

,DrunkenSquirrel,2005-08-10T17:36Z,"Seriously, how am I to install it? I have 4 files in a folder... and they don't do anything. Do I need some sort of installation program? Obviously, someone is installing this, how did you do it?"
,DrunkenSquirrel,2005-08-10T21:28Z,"Ok, it is installed, I get an error message right before the main menu pops up! A fix?"
,DrunkenSquirrel,2005-08-15T06:24Z,Does anybody have the serial number? That would be helpful since I can't play the game anymore.

,DrunkenSquirrel,2005-08-15T16:31Z,"Meh, it won't help, I got a serial number, but you can't play until you register the game, I fear that I may be sued if I register a game that I illegaly downloaded... Does anyone know whether they could track down a cracked copy and serial number?"
