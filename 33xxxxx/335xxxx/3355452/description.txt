 this song caught my attention more than any other when i     
 first heard Lamb's self titled debut cd. magnificent to say  
 the least. Ear Parcel is slightly different from its version 
 on Lamb's second album, Fear of Fours, and Lullaby is a dry, 
 abbrasive, stripped-down version of its later working.       
                                                              
 if you're curious as to the song title Gorecki, as i was,    
 be sure to check out these two releases..
