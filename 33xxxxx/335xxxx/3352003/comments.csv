,skipper2005,2005-07-08T16:40Z,"Thanks for the upload, madlib.
Just wondering if there is a trick for the installation... when running the install.exe program, it counts to 100% and then crashes :-(  Am I the only one with the problem ?"
,hotpussy,2005-08-02T20:32Z,"it would be useful if someone answered the question....does this install or not?

rather annoying to download such a big file and find it does not work

but often people say something won't work and it is just them unable to figure it out"
[T],L_Hammond,2005-08-03T21:42Z,"hotpussy: It works perfectly fine. I can of course only speak for myself, but I had no problem whatsoever during install. I'm running Windows XP. I installed Britannica mounted on a virtual drive with Alcohol 120. The online update (fetch new and updated articles) worked as well. If there were huge problems with this application, I am pretty sure that it would have been noticed in this comment section. The Pirate Bay guest's are not known to suffer in silence!"

Thanks!"
,dancingpotato,2006-08-15T07:15Z,Great download ! Works perfectly. English version. I used IsoBuster to mount it to the hd.. not in a folder however. Delete the files after ...thats all... 
,dancingpotato,2006-08-15T08:41Z,"   This Britannica is a very bad encyclopedia in my estimation ... though the installation worked well it is not one half as good as Encarta ! The volume of information in Encarta is three to four times more detailed ... and the interface is so much easier ! 
 Try a search on John Cage for example ...or Hitler ... the difference is amazing !
  I am afraid that Britannica is living on its reputation .... how anyone can say this is Encarta for educated people defies logic .... try them both and decide for yourself !"
,downcastrelic,2006-09-20T22:44Z,"who the fuck said encarta is better, this is the oldest and most trusted reference name in the world. Britannica is from the oxford group and if you dont know oxford is the most accredited university world wide"
,Dardanian__,2006-12-20T21:37Z,hmm.. are you referring to the UK Oxford? Actually I don't know of anyone else... The funny thing is that Encyclopaedia Britannica has been printed in the US for the last century..
