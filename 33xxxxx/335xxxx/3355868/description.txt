BARÇATRONICS is a music compilation officially released by FC Barcelona containing some Barça-related music. The album contains mostly dance/techno music. Along with a "different" version of Barça's club hymn, there are Brazilian-inspired house songs, and also Catalan & Spanish songs.
I've ripped the CD @ 160Kbps, and I've also included scans of the front and back covers, as well as the sleeve inserts.
