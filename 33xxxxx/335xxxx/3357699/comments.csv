,wildcatwillie,2005-07-18T17:20Z,"Military music and particularly German military music is a very popular item on most P2P networks. 

This bit of music is something I hadn't heard before. I only mentioned Hilter because of the significance of the occasion on which this recording was made. 

I made the clip for myself primarily and to add it to my historical military music collection from numerous countries, including the U.S., U.K., Netherlands, Germany, and Russia. I just thought as long as I went to the bother of making the clip I'd share it with others.  So far there have been a number of interested parties downloading it."
