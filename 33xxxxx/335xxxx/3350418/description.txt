From the nfo:

"The 3 MB german text was translated to english(?) in less than 1 day.
Yes, it was done by a clever software, so don't expect a perfect job.
Words out of place, weird phrases and unrecognized german slang...
and so on, but it's fully playable for the english speaking!
If you waited 4 years for this game, here's your chance!"

Tried the first level, obviously not Oxford english, but you not gonna have problem figuring out the meaning of the sentences. :)
