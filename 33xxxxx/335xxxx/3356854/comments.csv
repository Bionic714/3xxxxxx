,orbitfan,2012-03-30T16:00Z,"Why oh why r these in bin/cue file format!?  I cannot open these, instead of watching this film, I have spent the last two hours trawling the web, executing command line codes, installing conversion software. Nothing works. It's nearly 2 am and I have to give up. Please use avi or something that VLC can play. It so weird that there is even a format left that VLC and macs can't play. And only 2 days ago I had a windows machine I could have used. Sad, tired, frustrated."
,logically07,2012-05-27T01:59Z,how to play this video format via vlc player?
