,d0nk3y,2007-06-19T03:27Z,"This is how to install the maps.

I downloaded ""Western Europe v660.1256""

1. install TomTom Navigator ( this one )
2. Copy ""Cracked folder"" ( Guam_650 ) into your Phone Documents ( \My Documents ) ( not on your memorycard. but PHONE! )
3. So, i downloaded ""Western Europe v660.1256""
Now. Make a folder named ""Western Europe v660.1256"" Stright into your Memorycard and copy the map files. ( \Storage Card ) or Copy the whole folder ""Western Europe v660.1256"" in there. ( \Storage card\Western Europe v660.1256\..mapfiles.... )
4. Now you can start up the ""TomTom Navigator.exe"" and you will se it works just fine.

Enjoy!"
,buryblogger,2007-06-22T19:52Z,"Trying to get this to run on an XDA Orbit.  Following all instructions, but when SD loaded the install file never runs.  Just get the TomTom splash screen, then nothing else happens.  This did work on my XDA IIi, so don't know what the difference is.  Any ideas?"
