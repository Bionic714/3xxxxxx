Everyone can choose what course to download and what not. All you have to do is to have "silent download" disabled so that you can choose what to do with the torrent (where to download it, etc.). In BitSpirit, the client I use, it is on third sheet called "files" where you can tick/untick files you want/do not want. Please note that all the courses are in the folders - each folder is one course. So here we go - Brian Tracy and all the "21 series" courses (pure audio) I have from him. Enjoy it ;-) Eyesight
