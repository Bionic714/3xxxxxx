::::::::::: NEW Battlefield 1.01 client and server :::::::::::::::

This contains all files needed to either play of serve BF2 with V1.01.

For serving:

1: NEW 1.01 Dedicated server cracked/patched skipping Keycheck from Suspects.

For playing:

2: NEW 1.01 official client patch-upgrade from EA.

3: Mini-image to use with 1.01 client instead of NO-CD crack

4: Deamon tools 3.47, for those who dont have that

5: No annoying intro fix, to make the EA 20 sec intro go away.


Spread this on other torrent-sites aswell so the scene can move over to V1.01 as fast as possible.

Thanks.


Install-notes for server:

Same as V1.0


Install-notes for client:

Reinstall BF2 original / reloaded / clone, make sure it doesnt use the EXE / DLL from the NO-CD patch.

Then patch the client with the official V1.01 patch ( is slow and cpuintensive ).

Then mount the mini-image (used instead of no-cd crack).

Play and enjoy. (will only play on V1.01 cracked servers.)


Thanks.
