,DarthBeer,2005-07-08T02:44Z,"Thanks for this, however,
the server patch does'nt appear to have taken affect, friends are still getting invalid cd messages. Besides that, the server exe appears to have the same timestamp as the normal version."
,Karmacom,2005-07-08T03:08Z,"Thats strange, cause ive been playing on 4-5 servers using this patch, with a 1.01 client without a valid key with no problems. Are you sure you're doing it right? have you installed the 1.01 stand alone server first?"
,Karmacom,2005-07-08T04:00Z,"I just checked out the problem.

you need to either install the official 1.1 server standalone install first, then put that patched Bf2_w32ded.exe over the old one.

DO NOT just put that over an old 1.0 server install, wont work then.

OR, install the game, patch the game to 1.01, then copy the Bf2_w32ded.exe over the old one in the gamedir.

Im not 100% sure if the last method works, but the first method works fine for sure."
,HassiSan,2005-07-11T00:04Z,"PLZ HELP!

I don't get it...I've patched with the official v1.01 and I did not use the EXE/DLL crack, then I patched the server file and lastly I mounted the mini-image with Daemon.....AND NOTHING HAPPENDS!

All I get when I mount the mini-image is that a folder opens containig the mini-image files..ok...then I run BF2.exe and a Battlefiled 2 screen comes up and the game appears to be loading but then suddenly closes and back to the desktop I go!?

I've tried this many times now, and in various combinations and order, first time ever that I have a problem like this.

,Sugarcane_Spear,2005-07-11T00:43Z,HassiSan I have got the same problem here but when I checked Battlefield 2 folder which is in the startmenu I checked EasyInfo which tells me the requirements for the game to work but I saw that my system memory and display memory isn't enough for the game to work in my pc so check urs and see.Now I should upgrade my graphics card and PC this is the only thing that I hate in PC's.
,Sugarcane_Spear,2005-07-11T00:46Z,Guys if u have a problem then check the EasyInfo which is in the Battlefield 2 folder in the startmenu that might give u some help it will tell u the requirements u need for the game to work.

,damnit199,2005-08-02T21:22Z,"YESS! It worked for me. THANKS!!!!!! I have a Battlefield2 RELOADED DVD version. This is what I did. Before you start clean your Registry of previous installations(I used, Ace Utilities)

1)Install a clean version of Battlefield 2 Reloaded. Use vitality Keygen if you need to or any key-gen that works.(you can change it later with the BF2 keygen changer)

2)Restart your computer when it asks after finishing BF2 installation.

3)Donot apply the NoCD/DLL patch. A big NO!!! But do Install the v1.02 official patch.

4)Install Daemon tools if you don't have it on your PC and restart your computer when its finished installation.

5)Mount the BF2 mini image(mds file) by right clicking the daemon tools icon in the system tray bar.

6)Use the ""original"" desktop shortcut of Battlefield2 and it'll work fine. I repeat, all you have to do after mounting the mini-image is go to your desktop and click on the ORIGINAL BF2  .exe and the game works!!! It did for me!"
,damnit199,2005-08-02T21:28Z,"Oh sorry, forgot to mention one thing in the tutorial below. I installed the official v1.02 ""client"" patch. ......... And my computer configuration is > P4 3Ghz/ 1GB 333Mhz DDR Ram/ 128mb 6600GT/ 200GB Maxtor SATA HDD/ WinXP SP2 with every patch to this date. .... Ok that should be enough for comparisons! Hope your works too and hey don't forget to say thanks."
