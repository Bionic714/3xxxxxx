[V],thegoldman,2008-11-05T16:03Z,"Thanx I needed that track ""Tempted To Touch"" just heard it while watching the credits of the movie ""After the Sunset""...

All the peers (about 15) are stuck at 15%...

It will be great if this torrent survives, but I don't think that is gonna happen now, it's already 3 years old and I am able to download that particular song in full...

thanx"
[V],thegoldman,2008-11-05T16:06Z,"That song in the movie ending credits ""After the Sunset"" is a bit faster and that one sounds more dancing track... Probably that song is a remixed one!
thanx for this song again... 

Great wordings,,,... I am so tempted to touch... need so much... tempted to touch....
gr8!"
[V],thegoldman,2008-11-05T16:19Z,Probably that one is Rupee Ft. Daddy Yankee - Tempted To Touch (Reggaeton Remix)!
