Here it is...filth upon filth.  The most vile John Waters flick ever created.  XviD  110 Beta 2, optional subs in VOBsub format.  I had to special order this dvd...it took forever to find it.  Fun stuff.

Mini Plot:

Incest, drug trafficking, bestiality and an egg fetish are merely the tip of the proverbial iceberg in this ultra-black comedy from renegade filmmaker John Waters. With the title of "Filthiest Person Alive" at stake, Babs Johnson (Divine), her degenerate son and dim-bulb mother face stiff competition from the vile Marble clan (David Lochary and Mink Stole) in an unbridled assault on every taboo in the book. Edith Massey and Danny Mills co-star.

because they are totally computer illiterate.
