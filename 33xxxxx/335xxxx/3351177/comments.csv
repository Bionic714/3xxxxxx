,bigsexywzp,2008-02-29T09:21Z,Just letting you know that the link for the Xvid codec is no longer active. It's just an advertisement site now. No links work to download anything.
,bigsexywzp,2008-02-29T09:48Z,"Also, I can't get this whole XViD codec to work for shit. None of my video players can open the video file. What the hell am I doing wrong? There's no kind of readme on how to use it, apparently I'm not doing something right."
