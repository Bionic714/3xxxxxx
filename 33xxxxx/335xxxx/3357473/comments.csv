[V],GreyRaven,2005-08-05T05:29Z,"Lol just read the Legal thread and boy that was fun, though this most be the first person with legal threat mails that acctualy has a sense of humor and acctualy listened to what was said instead of corporate BS :D, hey hey, i might even buy a full set of issues, had i been into these comics..., got any Nekomimi type Comics EvilSibe?"
,Havenwar,2005-08-05T15:53Z,Gotta love it when the legal threats give the adress of the torrents in question so I easier can download them and cause more frustration on behalf o the ID 10 T copyright holders. 
,Havenwar,2005-08-05T16:35Z,"Oh yeah, and if you want this or other things like it in paper format, check out http://store.rabbitvalley.com 

I like rewarding people who listen to what is said instead of answering with more threats.

,Havenwar,2005-08-08T11:49Z,"What? Afraid a few furry nuts will keel you over? 

There is plenty of other items on the store to purchase if you want to support the dude but are too far in the closet to peek through the keyhole. ;)"
,LanceTodd,2005-08-12T17:40Z,Looks to me like our MR. Rabitt friend just might be a regular PirateBay user himself if he found such an obscure product so quickly on the good o'l TPB!!!
