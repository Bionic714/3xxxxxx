,elmo2,2005-07-05T19:33Z,You're the man Tripwire. Thank you very much for feeding us !
,badborg,2005-07-05T20:19Z,"Thanks tripwire, you rock!"
,badborg,2005-07-05T20:27Z,"kurgan666, yeah there was a lot less antip2p when I downloaded a couple hours ago.  I'm still seeding, and it looks like the antip2p activity is starting to pick up now... maybe they were off for July 4th and are just coming back from the long weekend and getting set up."
,badborg,2005-07-05T20:44Z,Shit.  Guess they are wide awake now.  I am getting hammered with a DOS attack.

,kornkob1995,2005-07-06T04:15Z,Thank you so much! you are the best! :D
,spacecadet27,2005-07-06T06:11Z,Does anyone know how i can adjust these audio delay settings when i burn using Nero??I have no idea how to mess with the audio...Thnx in advance
,greyspace,2005-07-06T08:55Z,"Thanks tripwire,

,greyspace,2005-07-06T08:58Z,"I'm not spamming. Don't know what happened, I guess I hit reload.  But it just conveys my triple appreciation."
,dklein,2005-07-06T13:44Z,"Thanks again Tripwire!  These are great quality.  For anyone going to DVD, looks like you need to delay the audio by 480ms to synch back up again.  weirdness..."
,hotpussy,2005-07-06T19:00Z,"thanks for the note about the sound being out of sync. i noticed this on a previous episode. but like the person who commented about nero, i also have no idea how to fix this when i burn the episodes to cd or dvd media.
it would be greatly appreciated if someone could explain this."
,asspower,2005-07-06T21:50Z,"can anyone help me play episode 1 (which I downloaded from the link provided)? My WMP says, ""Error downloading codec,"" and I get no audio. I've run G-spot on it and it claims I have the correct audio codec (MP3) installed. Furthermore, G-Spot claims that it has partial failures in rendering the video saying that ""some streams are in an unsupported format."" What gives? Should I download a different player or what? I've spent hours trying to get this season of SFU going, please help!! p.s. thanks a billion to all who have contributed to the anti P2P stuff and at least helped me get some uncorrupted files. 
"
,duveldrinker,2005-07-07T21:33Z,"@asspower: try using VLC instead of WMP, it worked for me when I had to view (other) avi-Files on a PC. 

@soap_on_a_rope: I am using Azureus with the Safepeer-Plugin to block the IPs, it works fine!"
,dklein,2005-07-08T06:16Z,"Regarding the audio delay - I'm dealing with it by punching in the 480ms delay in BeSweet, which I'm using to convert the extracted mp3 into ac3 audio.  (first I extract the mp3 with avi2wav).  You'll find these tools free.  It really depends what tools you use.  You can set the delay using TMPGEnc Express.  You could just add the silence to the beginning with a wave editor and resave the file.  "
,biggestknife,2005-07-10T21:15Z,"thank you tripwire. 
it's too bad that it's going to be the last season."
,virginia_voley,2005-07-21T15:50Z,I've blocked all the ips mentioned and still can't get a good copy! what can I do? the other solution is for anyone to make copies in cds for me! I'm truly desperate
,rotkopf,2005-08-01T08:26Z,"Thank you!
Now, please please please give us Ep 9!  Stupid friends spoiled it for me and now I have to see it or i will lose my mind. :P"
