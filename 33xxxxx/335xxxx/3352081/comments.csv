,divac,2005-07-04T19:27Z,thanks ! is this the uncut version ?
,d-pad,2005-07-04T22:43Z,"it's a rip of the blue underground release... i'd hesitate to say uncut as there are a number of deleted scenes as extras on the dvd, but as far as i know this is as ""uncut"" as you're likely to get!"
,divac,2005-07-05T01:31Z,"aha, ok, blue underground, cool ! maybe you can one day also rip the extras :-D will get this and the nance docu - already got the other two freakyflicks you posted... did you ever upload something else here before ? thanks again for all"
,d-pad,2005-07-05T07:59Z,"search ""freakyflicks"" for my other rips (8 so far) ;)"
