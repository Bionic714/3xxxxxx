,wangho75,2005-07-02T01:44Z,I have pretty much every video he's done and lots of rare shows.  Didnt figure there were so many fans of Nuno here...or did I do that??
,extreme333,2005-07-02T12:58Z,"Oh...we are out here, we are just not saying to much."
,extreme333,2005-07-02T12:59Z,"By the way, nice cupids dead solo demo."
,wangho75,2005-07-03T23:40Z,"yes, it's too bad he had to play that really crappy Silvertone guitar.  That's like James Dean driving a Pinto or something.."
,extreme333,2005-07-06T03:39Z,"lol
yeah, i havent seen him play that solo so its good enough for me.
but it shows that he isnt really happy with the guitars."
