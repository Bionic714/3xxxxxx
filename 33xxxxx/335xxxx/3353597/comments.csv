dvd-player starts from the menu where you have to choose the language, and then comes the warning text and it stop there. tryed every language and nothing."

,Excorcist,2006-05-28T12:28Z,"Mine DOES work on standalone DVD.. Hmm?
Are you sure that your DVD Player can play PAL DVDs?

All I did was to mount it with Deamon Tools and then I cloned it with CloneDVD2 :)

Works great for me!"

,varmekanin,2007-10-30T12:40Z,"Seriously, you people leeching now someone stay up to ratio 1:1 or 2:1 or something, I will probably only stay for as long as I download the other austin powers and then leave, I'm already up to ratio 5.9:1 and still I'm the only seeder staying. If noone else of you keep seeding it you won't have a seeder once I leave."
,varmekanin,2007-10-31T02:21Z,"Yay, 6 people with the whole thing, ration 7.8:1, oooh behave!"
,varmekanin,2007-11-02T01:10Z,"Downloaded with Bittyrant.
Uncompressed with unrarx.
Burned with Toast Titanium 8.

Macbook Pro DVD-drive and Verbatim 16x DVD+R MCC004 discs.

Played in Pioneer DV-370.

Everything seems to work, country choice, menu, movie and extras.

Seems like only 2.1 audio is included thought, to bad on the DTS which seems to be a choice on he original. I saw no 5.1.

My intention was to mount the disc and burn the VIDEO_TS dir thought, but I forgot about it, doubt it would change anything considering the disc works thought."
,maximumxp,2012-05-27T23:52Z,Seed please! Stuck on 88.5%
