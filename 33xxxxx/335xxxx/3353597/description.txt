						MOViE SUMMARY:   

		  He's found his mojo, baby, and now Austin Powers (Mike Myers) is back 
		  again in this shagadelic comedy-adventure! The "sshhh!" hits the fan when
		  Dr. Evil and Mini-Me escape from prison. Joining forces with the superfreaky Goldmember,
		  they kidnap Austin's father, master spy Nigel Powers (Michael Caine), in a dastardly
		  time-travel scheme to take over the world. Before you can say "Shake Your Booty," 
		  Austin cruises to 1975 and teams up with sexy Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles) to stop 
   		  Dr. Evil and Goldmember from their mischievous mayhem. With Michael York, Robert Wagner, 
		  Seth Green, Mindy Sterling and Verne J. Troyer.
