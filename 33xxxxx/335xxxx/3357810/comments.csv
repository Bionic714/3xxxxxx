,flygsvamp,2005-07-18T19:58Z,What is this? Anther one of those tales that religious people use to scare one another closer to God?
,rci,2005-07-18T20:31Z,"i dont think so, i found this file on david icke web site........ it is more an unauthorised and underground presentation of the 'innocent' chip the global fascists wants to put on every live human....... they want remote-controllable slaves !"
,sychostalker,2005-07-18T20:50Z,NWO theories are so popular! I'm becoming to get paranoid... Hey! maybe that's what they want. One thing is for certain: they watching you :)
,Boog,2005-07-19T00:00Z,"flygsvamp: Instead of trying ridicule and discredit something you obviosly know nothing about, maybe you should read it, and then decide if you think this is bullshit, or something worth studying further?? If there is some truth to it, then it's definitely something you'd want to know about before they come to install one in your brain. Incidentally, the people behind this, are the same people who has used religion to control people for so long... If your so afraid of being trapped by religion, I take it you are not very interested in a full fledged mind control device in your skull, hmm...??
