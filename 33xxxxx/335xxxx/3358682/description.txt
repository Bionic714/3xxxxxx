
Ok, here's bf2 cd-key validator v1.0.

BF2KeyValidator.exe program takes keys generated by keygen and puts 
them in genuine EA's BF2 key validator "Battlefield 2_code.exe". 
This program is used when user installs BF2 and is asked for proper key.

Because of the fact the "Battlefield 2_code.exe" says whether the key 
is valid or invalid all valid keys are stored by BF2KeyValidator.exe 
in "results.txt" file.

When you get a valid key you can install bf2 1.0 using this key and 
then install 1.02 patch. Or you can try to use in any other way eg. 
put it in proper place in registry or else to play official servers.


Fell free to use. If u don't like it, remove it :)
