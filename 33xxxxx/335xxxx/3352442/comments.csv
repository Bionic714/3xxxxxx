,phakira,2005-07-05T15:31Z,"Takk for upload... ser fram til å leeche poker superstars når du får de nye avsnittene...

Pokermiljonen kunne ha vært et greit program... men kommentatorene ødelegger det totalt, helt utrolig dumme... :)"
,maveric1337,2005-07-05T16:10Z,"FUCK you leechers. Dont count on me seeding this when im done, BURN IN HELL."
,thrawny,2005-07-05T17:24Z,About 12 minutes into CD1 everything freezes for me. Does anyone have the same problem and if so how can this be solved?
,poonking,2005-07-05T17:34Z,"CD1 is freezing on me also, around 12 mins"
,maveric1337,2005-07-05T18:46Z,"i have the same problem, even in VLC :((((

It just skipps to CD2 after 12 min."
,maveric1337,2005-07-05T18:47Z,atleast cd2 is working properly
,nolem,2005-07-05T18:58Z,"Ok, i have looked at this now.

CD1 is totally fucked up, the file (after a while) contains only lost of 0,0,0,0,0,0 all the way in the (meaning no data) so after about 12 min is just a huge empty file."
,gizmopus,2005-07-05T19:27Z,Thanks :)
,bzkt,2005-07-06T00:14Z,Can't believe you upload without even knowing that  the files aren't corrupt. You're so eager too spread your spam txt-files you just upload huh?
,pokerfreak,2005-07-06T00:34Z,"Yes, CD1 dies 13:21 for me, Im so fucking sorry for this.

I got it from a good friend on DC (it apperently works for him) and posted it here before I even watched to spread it fast for you guys.

He always have topnotch stuff so I didn't imagine it could have been a problem. I'll re-leech from him and post a 100% checked and working CD1 later tonight or tomorrow if nobody does it before me. 

bzkt: please never download one of my posts never again. 

the rest: Sorry again for the bad post, I'll make sure it doesn't happen again."
,phocuz,2005-07-06T00:46Z,"Seriously guys, Pokerfreak is a hero! He´s been supplying our drug of choice for quite some time now. He doesnt have to do it, and he doesnt screw it up on purpose. So just be nice, he´ll fix it. :)

Thanks pokerfreak!"
,bzkt,2005-07-06T00:57Z,"pokerfreak don't get me wrong, I'm really grateful for all your uploads. The thing I don't like is the spam, and that in this case I believe spam went before the quality of the upload.

I will continue download your uploads if I want them."
,KingRat,2005-07-06T00:58Z,"Doh, yeah PokerFreak is by all means the Hero here. You shouldn't even have to appologize!

And maveric1337, why don't you butt out, no ones happy with that attitude."
,okaaay,2005-07-06T01:03Z,"Yeah, just had to log on to say ""great damn job upping the torrents"".
I love the show, and I love you for putting them here.
Ungrateful people can, and should, be quiet."
,KingRat,2005-07-06T01:06Z,"This was a great episode, almost as great as the crazy 13th."
,de3th,2005-07-06T01:13Z,when will the working cd 1 come out 
,bzkt,2005-07-06T01:18Z,"""We're experiencing some issues with the database. Please try again soon.""
Impossible to upload at the moment."
,pokerfreak,2005-07-06T02:28Z,.. and a clickable link for the lazy ones :D ... Correct version of CD1
,pokerfreak,2005-07-06T02:30Z,"uhm, they filtered the html a-tag.. oh well. Gotta sleep, I'll leave the computer on during the night for the fixed CD1. If I wake up and cant sleep cause of it I'll say ""fuck it"" .. and continue to seed in the morning ;)"
,grazzz,2005-07-06T02:39Z,"As usual, you rock pokerfreak!!!!!"

,i.c.u,2005-07-07T13:11Z,thx cant get enough poker
,Winnson,2005-07-08T17:48Z,"I tried it and it just kind of 'x's out
I've put them up lots and there are tons of seeders, so it shouldn't be a problem.

I've just read the posts and wouldn't advise flaming bzkt.  He's put these up too.

Man, you guys that up these are heros.  I live in Hong Kong and wouldn't be able to buy, see, or even know about these if it weren't for communities like this.  I really don't know what to say, I'm so grateful.

Big ups to you guys and if there's anything I can ever do, let me know.  You guys totally rock.

Thanks a million, trillion, berjillion, times infinity, to the power of the same.

Winnson (I'm serious about letting me know if there's anything I can do)"
