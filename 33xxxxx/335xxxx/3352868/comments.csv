,kt_haddock,2005-07-06T22:41Z,"Hi folks, If i wont to update from ver 5.56 to 6.0.
Howe should i do ? I want to use my snr. Can I install over the old app or uninstall and then install the new one? "
,danny5025,2005-07-06T22:55Z,"Be warned. This app uses a shitload of resources. I would recommend using kaspersky instead. 

Haddock:Yes of course you can uninstall and install the new one. "
,hetajo,2005-07-07T12:31Z,"Yes it uses a lot of resources because this has three scanning engines instead of the usual one.

This program is maybe the best if only security is in one's interests.

I have used something 5.56 on k6-2 400 and you can't really say it's fast..."
