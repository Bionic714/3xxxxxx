me thinks what is meant by that post is because he paid for it, EVERYONE should have to pay the 10.00 - 29.95 us dollars that this proggie costs _ 

because it is  small company compared to Microsoft, Adobe, Roxio, Ahead, etc. It's ok to steal from those but not aight to steal from a supposedly small company... 

aka_ Honor among thieves.

Find it odd that some peeps think that people at  large companys don't work hard.

is a newer CCE. Set DVD-RB to ""CCE SP Trial"" if using it..
qazwsx123: I agree a bit that DVD-RB Pro shouldnt be widespread (because there is a very good, only somewhat limited free version), but this isnt the newest version."
