|  Cold is a post-alternative metal band based in Jacksonville, Florida.     |
|  The group shares a similar aesthetic to Limp Bizkit, another              |
|  Jacksonville-based band. Both group's favor technically complex, bleak    |
|  and brutal metal, merging Jane's Addiction, Metallica and Tool into a     |
|  raw, grimy signature sound. Limp Bizkit discovered Cold playing in the    |
|  Jacksonville area and helped them sign to the A&M subsidiary Flip.        |
|  Cold's eponymous debut album was released in the summer of 1998. Through  |
|  constant touring, the band earned a modest, but devoted audience prior    |
|  to the release of Cold. In fall 2000, Cold returned to release their      |
|  sophomore effort 13 Ways to Bleed on Stage.                               |
|                                                                            |
