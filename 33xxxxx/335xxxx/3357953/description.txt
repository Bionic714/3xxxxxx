After numberous plaudits for the first EP Monotonik released from US-based 
Grandma, including 'Net-Audio Release of the Month' in cult German 
paper-magazine De:Bug, we were keen to press on and put out some more 
material from the 15-year-old prodigy, who we think is one of the most 
amazing artists we've ever released on Mono.

This time, we've got a 4-tracker showcasing more of his diverse and eccentric 
talent, put together with just an old PC and rickety microphone, as before, 
but radiating lo-fi soul all the same.

The EP starts with "Abortions Rock", with the title belying a synth-wash-filled, 
stealthy drift through a multi-layered Garden Of Eden. Next, "Have Sex With 
A Tree" is a stupendously melodic magical carpet ride, like Squarepusher's 
'Port Rhombus' on an even more polyhedral day.

Next, "My God Is Better Than Yours" sets a sweet Grandma-plucked acoustic 
guitar loop and drapes strings, minimal drums, and intentionally lo-fi vocals 
over the top to heartfelt effect. And finally, yes, "Amazing Larry Does Not 
Bite Off Of Other Songs" does include an expressionless robotic voice rapping 
about 'biting off lines' from 'Ruff Ryder's Anthem'. What of it?

So what's the point? Maybe that this music is touching enough to make you 
feel good when you're in a bad place, and strong when you're in a weak place 
- and it's just the tip of the strangely skewed iceberg when it comes to 
Grandma's material, which richly deserves a wider audience still. We hope he 
gets it.
