,Fikret,2005-08-08T11:49Z,If you dont want to be an idiot as my bosnian friend Adnan that uploaded this file you dont have to get FOXhound rank to get Infinite face paint. How: Theres an animal called chochinoko thats hidden there you meet The Fear. Find that one and you will get FOXhound rank AND Infinite Face Paint. The Infinite Face Paint gives you infinite ammo on every gun. But if you want to BE REAL AMAZED. I got a videotape there I accomplish this game in 1:01:55. I now Im a MGS god.
