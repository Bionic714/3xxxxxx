....Any suggestions? TIA"

Use nero 6.6.0.8 to burn a CD-R.

1. Open Nero
2. Create audio cd
3. Add
4. Mark the flac files
5. Add
6. Finish
7. Check the ""No pause between tracks"" box
8. Next
9. Fill inn title/artist if you like
10. Choose burning speed
11. Burn! 

The CD must be played through a home theatre that supports surrond (DTS I think). You may also use a PC media player that supports DTS, ie. VLC media player (may be downloaded from http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html )

Hope this helps! Surround music recordings are really cool ;-)"
