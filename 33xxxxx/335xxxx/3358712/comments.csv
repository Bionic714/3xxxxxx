Have you got an unlock code?"
,Nilsen,2005-07-23T14:06Z,You don't need a unlock key to Metroguide.
,consensus,2005-07-24T12:58Z,"Thanks, but when I try to burn the ISO file #1 to a CD I get an error message stating that the disk does not match the source disk. When I try to burn it on a DVD I get the same thing.

Any solution?"
,Atomas,2005-07-26T04:38Z,"I can burn no problem using NERO .On my side the instalation bugs when need inserting disk 2 , it does'nt reconise disk 2 , it keep asking PLEASE INSERT DISK 2.     Any idea anyone"
,jelaitin,2005-07-30T15:06Z,"This covers whole Finland?

,jelaitin,2005-07-31T17:24Z,"I try to burn ISO-image file with Nero, I get only message: ""Sorry, This is not a valid Nero disc image file""

,gotglasses,2006-01-24T13:53Z,Same problem -2nd disc not recognized. These are not ISO files.  Something missing in Disc2?
,gotglasses,2006-01-26T06:05Z,"OK - now I got it - Do not UNRAR the RAR files, just open / mount them up in Alcohol120 and it will burn the disc properly."
,nicost,2006-02-26T09:17Z,eh
,nicost,2006-02-26T09:18Z,"This is how to upload locked maps to any compatible garmin gps:

You will need the following programs:
Sendmap20
http://cgpsmapper.com/download/sendmap20.zip
GPSMapEdit
http://www.geopainting.com/en/#last
Winrar or Winzip

It is not very difficult to do, but still it has some complications.
Forgive me my english, im learning it!

1)Download the maps (Mapsource City select North America, or Europe, or Metroguide, or City Navigator or similar)
2)Install it
3)Download Sendmap20 and GPSMapedit and extract the zips to any folder you want.
4)Open Mapsource and choose the maps you need and remember more or less on which part of the big map they are.
5)Open GPSMapedit and go to the file menu and select open."
,nicost,2006-02-26T09:20Z,"6)Open xxxxxx.tdb located were mapsource is installed. Usually C:Program FilesMapsource.
The xxxxxx.tdb are different for the differents versions of maps. For example for North America City Select version 5 
the file name is nacsv5.tdb"
,nicost,2006-02-26T09:22Z,"7)When you open this file you will see vaguely the shape of, for example, USA in the case of North America maps, or
you will see vaguely the shape europe in the case you are using maps form this continent."
,nicost,2006-02-26T09:23Z,"8)Zoom the area you are interested and compare it with the maps in mapsource. You should start seeing some numbers, 
for example 00063856.img "
,nicost,2006-02-26T09:23Z,"10) Copy on a piece of paper the numbers of the maps you are interested on sending to the gps (this part is boring)
11)Now open sendmap20."
,nicost,2006-02-26T09:23Z,"12)Press the Add Maps button, and browse to the mapsource directory. There you will see a some files and 2 or more folders.
One of the folders is USB_Drivers, the other would be the folder containing the maps files. In the case of North America City 
Select is NACSV5. Open this folder and you will see a lot of files. The files you should see should be something 
like 00063856.img Select from the list the files with the numbers you wrote before, and click open. "
,nicost,2006-02-26T09:24Z,"13)Plug your gps to the computer. Then click the Upload maps to Gps, and thats it.


Note: You may need yor gps drivers. Download them from www.garmin.com"
,nicost,2006-02-26T09:24Z,"In the case of the iQue, instead of pressing the upload maps button, click on the Create GPSMAPSUPP.img A file will be 
crated. Save this file on C:Program FilesPalmXXXXXCardInstSlot-SD. The xxxxx is a folder that varies. The next time
you make a Hotsync, it should upload your maps. I never tried this last thing, but i think it works."
,nicost,2006-02-27T01:04Z,"***************************************
SORRY, THIS WORKS FOR OLDER VERSIONS OF METROGUIDE.
