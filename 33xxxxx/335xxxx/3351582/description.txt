If lo-fi recording has been viewed as valid and hip since the silly ‘80s, it was something that young musicians low on funds – and without digital 16 track recording facilities on their Dad’s PC – had to rely on in the ‘60s and ‘70s if they wanted their music to resemble
anything close to the output of a professional band. And you can bet your bottom dollar that if they had the tech they’d have used it. For his self-pressed album The Grey Wizard Am I Chris Wilson (AKA Gandalf) bounced down all of the instruments onto a ’72 Sony tape recorder. 1000 copies were made and given to friends and family, with a few being sold; and Chris never guessed his gentle/primitive folk-rock album would become a cult collectors item 30+ years on. Although the pointed hat and staff image post-Peter Jackson has taken on a different meaning, in ’72 Lord Of The Rings was a slightly obscure piece of literature that the counter-culture held close to their hearts; not something of a franchise for fantasy based toys, sticker albums, games, pyjamas and y-fronts! Much of Wilson’s album, most obviously, focuses on the book. If you will, imagine Donovan on vocals with a wee bit of Arthur Lee circa Forever Changes stirred into your average Greenwich Village folkies’ repertoire and you’re over half way there in understanding this slightly invigorating album. Once you get past the – unintentionally – primitive recording values, you’ll find a most pleasant folk-rock/psych album.
