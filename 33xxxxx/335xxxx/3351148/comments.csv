,Screenname,2005-07-02T05:15Z,where is the RLS nfo. Or did you compile this yourself?
,Screenname,2005-07-02T06:28Z,Can you explain the steps that you took to encode this DVD.
,Screenname,2005-07-02T06:49Z,"Also, could you give me the specs of your computer, time it took to do this, and possibly the setttings that you used for the various programs that you used to make this wonderful DVD. 

I am thinking of doing this with another show that I have recorded using my PVR. "
,A Nude Walus,2005-07-02T07:28Z,So would it be safe to assume that you'll be compiling the rest of the season into more discs as it comes out? :) 
,Myusername,2005-07-02T07:53Z,"Yep, even though it was a pain-in-the-ass to make the first one. It's mostly a waiting game while encoding/compressing. I just hope tv.com (formally tvtome) is right with their episode list, they list 14 episodes for season 4, which would leave us with this:

Disc 1: 5 episodes
Disc 2: 5 episodes
Disc 3: 4 episodes

Any more discs and it really would'nt be practical for me or you guys."
,Myusername,2005-07-02T08:02Z,"Sorry, I guess the ""Stewie Trilogy"" episodes won't be airing? So thats 11 so far, not 14."
,Myusername,2005-07-02T08:04Z,"@Screenname,

Pirate Bay's comments layout sucks so no spaces.

PC specs (not the best, but it works for me):

Dell Inspiron 1100 Laptop: 2.3GHz, 632MB of RAM

NOTE: There are many ways to do this, the way that worked for 

me may not be the best for others. For guides here's 2 good 

sites: videohelp.com & afterdawn.com

Programs used:

AVI2DVD
CCE
TMPGEnc DVD Author
DVD Rebuilder

Step 1: Converted AVI episodes to dvd-compliant mpegs with 

AVI2DVD, using CCE as the encoder set to 5 passes. Each 

episode took 3 1/2 to 4 hours.

Step 2: Made a background for the menu (buttons will be added 

with TMPGEnc DVD Author) in Paint Shop Pro.

Step 3: Authored with TMPGEnc DVD Author. Insert the episodes 

into the program, finish the menu by adding text/buttons, and 

output your dvd.

Step 4: My finished dvd ended up being 5.6GB. This is too big 

because: 1. I don't have any DL discs 2. DL discs are still too 

expensive for the ""average consumer"" and 3. I figured most 

peeps that use bit torrent still prefer dvd5s. So the dvd must be 

compressed to 4.3GB.

Step 5: Compressed with DVD Rebuilder using CCE as the 

encoder set to 3 passes. This will take at least 5 hours. 

Compressing the dvd overnight is recommended.

Also, what show are you thinking about making into dvds?"
,A Nude Walus,2005-07-02T09:24Z,"eh, who knows. hopefully we don't wind up with 16 episodes :p"
,meig,2005-07-02T15:55Z,"interesting..

Ill have to check this out."
,Screenname,2005-07-02T16:53Z,"1 Question, what is the AVI2DVD for if you are using CCE? The shows that I was going to do this for were Jackass, American Dad, and The Office. Maybe you could give me the info of an IRC channel and we could chat the details."
,Screenname,2005-07-02T16:54Z,"Also, I like your menu. It looks almost exdactly liek the real one"
,Myusername,2005-07-02T19:00Z,"CCE's interface is'nt the most user-friendly, programs like AVI2DVD & DVD Rebuilder act as complementary programs and have easy-to-use user-friendly GUIs, they also tell CCE what to do to your files.

As for chatting the details, theres not really much I left out. This is my first time making a homebrew dvd from scratch using AVI files, so I kind of ""winged"" it. I did some research on the subject and it ended up paying off.

Anyone else think that LOL should release their animated hd rips in a higher resolution, maybe 720x480? The episodes would look a lot better that way, but I'm not complaining. Also peeps, I did this as a learning experience in custom dvd creation and I highly recommend buying Family Guy Season 4 when it hits stores. If this show gets cancelled again thats it."
,Plasmaneo,2005-07-04T14:33Z,"The complete season 4 hasen't aired yet, are all episodes really there?"
,Myusername,2005-07-04T15:02Z,"No, it contains the first 5 episodes of season 4."
,Myusername,2005-07-06T11:45Z,"I think I made the piece size too big (4mb), I just used auto since this is my first torrent. I'll watch the piece size next disc."
,ZeRo-cOoL,2005-07-07T02:40Z,Hi I Love your dvd custom. Please continue doing this with the season 4.. I really like it... Thanks dude...
,Myusername,2005-07-07T10:21Z,"Your welcome, as long as the AVIs for Season 4 get posted I'll make the discs. And next time it will be faster because the piece size I used was way too big."
,buckdog05,2005-07-15T13:46Z,"Thanks for the seed, but I have had it up all night, and it is only .1% done.  I have tons of bandwith available, so what's up?"
,buckdog05,2005-07-15T13:47Z,"Once it's done, I can seed for a while"
,loogiedude,2005-07-17T17:46Z,"Hi, I'm having trouble writing this to a dvd. I'm using Nero and just used the wizard to go to the ""create/modify dvd+vr"" and when it starts it just says ""preparing VIDEO_TS for transcoding"" and nothing happens. Any suggestions ?"
,loogiedude,2005-07-17T17:49Z,"Oh and by the way, I'm using the PAL system, but I did try to have it in NTSC but then it said it was too big for the dvd disc."
,Myusername,2005-07-17T23:28Z,"I would suggest using a DVDÂąR, not DVDÂąVR. Using VR is probably the cause of your problem."
,buckdog05,2005-07-18T16:49Z,What a DVD-R?
,buckdog05,2005-07-18T16:50Z,What about a DVD-R? 
,Myusername,2005-07-18T18:05Z,"Your kidding right? It's a blank dvd, you know, so you can burn what you've just downloaded."
,buckdog05,2005-07-22T02:38Z,"I thought there was some kind of problem with burning it.  I know how to burn a dvd, thanks"
,Myusername,2005-07-22T04:41Z,"Just figured you were new to burning, I was kinda being a smartass, sorry about that. Good luck with the burning."
,Myusername,2005-07-25T06:47Z,"The sound will be there. The AUDIO_TS folder is for audio dvds, where the VIDEO_TS folder would be empty. But it's good to keep it on there when burning because of compatability issues, theres probably more to it than that, but I've read that a few different times (all dvds have both folders). If you use Nero to burn, you'll notice when you go to new, there is an empty VIDEO_TS & AUDIO_TS folder, you drop the files    from the dvd's VIDEO_TS folder to Nero's then burn."
,Greeko135,2005-08-04T06:40Z,"Quick question, what DVD Authoring Program did you use to create the DVD?"
,Myusername,2005-08-05T03:46Z,"It was authored with TMPGENC DVD Author, the images were created first with Paint Shop Pro."
,superhumanjesse,2006-10-12T15:54Z,i think this is PAL and not NTSC cuz it doesnt fit my tv right but still 13 episodes on one nice dvd good job!
