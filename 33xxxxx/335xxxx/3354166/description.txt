Joanna Newsom Demo EPs

Before releasing The Milk Eyed Mender on Drag City in 2004, Joanna Newsom self-released two EPs on CD-Rs and distributed them at shows. All songs appearing on The Milk-Eyed Mender were re-recorded. There are currently no plans to release them officially.

Hopefully this will stem the tide of lossy versions and $200 eBay auctions of this material.

Lineage for both EPs is:
CD-R -> CD-R(1) -> CD-R(2) -> EAC -> DBPowerAmp -> FLAC
