,Daffke,2005-07-25T12:27Z,Is there a RM player for Ps2?
,asakura131,2005-07-25T19:27Z,More seeds please.!.!
,asakura131,2005-07-25T19:28Z,And how's the quality?
,PopeFalsity,2005-07-28T21:06Z,It's rather high quality.  Just because each .rm file is half the size of a typical .avi file doesn't mean there's a loss of quality--it simply means it won't take as long to download.
