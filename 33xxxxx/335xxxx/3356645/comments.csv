,Silentcrow,2006-02-27T03:48Z,"WARNING........

,The-Duck,2006-03-03T12:25Z,"Silentcrow: this game is clean so dont say dumb stuff [if it werent, there would have been more posts]"
,>Flanders<,2006-04-14T18:01Z,"yeah,its so good uppload you have the-duck

thanks for shearing this game :D"
,Thai-N!sse,2006-05-16T18:11Z,"fett bra torrent,löjligt lätt att installera och det funkar utan crack.har laddat ner den 2 gånger för att jag tog bort hela skiten av ett misstag.schyssta grejer The-Duck!!!!"
,iceclimbers1,2006-07-30T19:57Z,more seeders please!!
,iceclimbers1,2006-07-31T05:15Z,"okay I just typed something and there was a god damn database error, but it took me like 5-10 minutes to type so I am not giving full scoop againl. Long story short, I have a large amount of evidence saying that this thing contains a Trojan named ""winmfu32.dll"" installed in the directory ""C:\WINDOWS\system32"". I had nothing else, torrent or not, being downloaded. I may not be able to get rid of it, if anyone else knows of this, please tell me nad if it's removable. Thus far I personnaly think Mr. Duck is a fag. "
,The-Duck,2006-09-02T18:59Z,"ill wont even answer someone like u who cant even protect his comp from trojens and then starts blaming clean sources for his problem.
and please dont start by calling me by names"
,The-Duck,2006-11-10T23:41Z,"This game IS clean....  despite what some ppl say....  

I'm seeding 24/7/365...  
I cant do much more for u from my computer..."
,The-Duck,2006-11-16T22:06Z,"well....   just after i read your comment i deleted my own copy of the Rise of Nations torrent and re-downloaded it....

guess what was the average down rate.
it was 120+-kb/sec
so as i see it, the problem isnt in not enough seeders but might be in your bittorent client.
i dunno whats ur knowledge in the area but...  try opening a port on you router or switching to a client that supports DHT trackers like BitComet/Lord"
,The-Duck,2006-11-18T08:20Z,"distance shouldnt have any affects (at least not something u can see).
i personaly use BitComet right now and im very satisfied with it. im also experimenting with some other clients like Bitspirit.

as for the ports you should open for ur client.
i didnt understand if u did forward the ports for utorrent...  so follow these steps here if u didnt.

> Click Options in the menu at the top of your screen. In the list that drops down click Preferences. 

> Click Network Options on the left hand side of the Utorrent program.

> Make sure the Enable UPnP box is unchecked. The number in the Port Used for Incoming Connections box contains the port you need to forward. You can change the port number, if you want to. 

(taken from PortForward.Com)

the rest is up to u in the router configuration.if u have any other problems just tell me 
The-Duck"
,The-Duck,2006-11-25T08:55Z,the img isnt active....
,The-Duck,2006-11-25T14:10Z,"Follow these steps:
Before u start, make sure u have a Static IP address.
( how to make a Static IP address - http://www.portforward.com/networking/staticip.htm )

1) Click Options in the menu at the top of your screen. In the list that drops down click Preferences.
2) Select Network Options on the left hand side of the Utorrent Preferences.
3) Make sure the Enable UPnP box is unchecked. The number in the Port Used for Incoming Connections box contains the port you need to forward. You can change the port number, if you want to.
[I know im writing the same thing as before...]
4) Browse to ur router through IE, Firefox or whatever.. (i guess u know how to since u took a pic of the routers menu)
5) Click the Advanced link near the left side of the page. u should see a new list under the Advanced link now, select Virtual Server from the list.
6) Now insert the numbers as instructed here:
   ID: 1 (2,3,4 doesnt matter)
   Public Port - Start: (Enter the port u want to forward, in this case, the Utorrent port)
   Public Port - End: (Enter the port u want to forward, in this case, the Utorrent port)
   Private Port: (Enter the port u want to forward, in this case, the Utorrent port)
   Port Type: TCP
   Host IP Address: (your Static IP address)

I took this from PortForward.com (i.e. http://www.portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/DSE-DickSmithElec/XH7916-REL10v2/Utorrent.htm )

if u have any other problems just tell me

,The-Duck,2006-11-25T14:12Z,ow ya...  dont forget to click Add next to the ID your forwarding
,generalfunny007,2006-12-06T18:20Z,the daemon tools version v3.4.7 had an installation error 25057
,The-Duck,2006-12-07T12:24Z,"since i posted this torrent a long time ago i suggest try downloading only the ""daemon tools version v3.4.7"" or try reinstalling it.

but the best choice is to download a more up-to-date version from:

http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=5

be sure to select the correct download (theres one for x64 and x86,32 machines)

hope this info helped u

I'm quite new to torrents and stuff.
I'm using BitTorrent and I'm trying to download this torrent.
Currently I got 58.3% but now it wont download any further.
How do I solve this?"

For what do you need this and how do I open ports?"

Thanks in advance"
,galixieman,2010-01-01T13:26Z,"hi there, the-duck.
a friend put this game on my pc years ago....i loved playing it.
i now have a new pc, but im having a few problems when i try to play, it tells me to try reinstalling from the game or to insert the cd.
the file that i downloaded doesn't want to work right, it could be that i'm doing something wrong, but it played fine untill i turned off the computer for the night, then it just woundn't let me back again without error messages telling me to reinstall.
if you would be able to copy the cd and send it to me, i think i'd stop having trouble.
please think about giving your email addresson this site....if you don't want to, i will understand, you seem to get alot of asses with only half a brain trying to talk shit instead of asking for some real help.

thanks for putting up with so many morons and still posting such a fun game.

,jisjames007,2011-01-25T16:28Z,"@ con-j
1. once you have installed daemon tools.
2. u will c a red icon in the tray. (near the clock)
3. right click on that
4. go2 virtual cd/dvd rom
5. go to set numbr of devices
6. select 1
7. do 4 and 5
8. u will c a line that says no media
9. point there 
10. click on mount image.
11. selct the .cue file from the extracted file. (wen u downloaded this torrent you get it within the RON folder)
12. once u selected it you will c the RON installation begin. then follow duck's intructions.

Wat daemon tools does is that it tricks your computer into thinking that it has a CD rom. to install this game legaly
 you have to buy their CD
insert it into to the cd rom then the cd will run from the rom. but here all you do is create a virtual drive. now remeber not
 to disable the virtual drive. if you do so you wont be able to play the game. you get lots of info from youtube and other sources (if you need more)"

,100rN0,2012-01-01T15:59Z,"Installation went smooth (thanks Mr.Duck) but, when playing, mouse wasn't responding (cursor stayed in the middle of the screen, unable to scroll thru menus etc.)

To all facing this problem (win7x64b), solution is simple:

right click on the desktop, then goto screen resolution, click on the link ""make text and items smaller and bigger"" and set it to smaller 100%

Just as an update to the agony. :)

Kudos goes to kmacNchips who posted this solution on windows answers forum."
