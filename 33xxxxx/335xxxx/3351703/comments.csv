,mrfr0gz,2006-07-17T02:43Z,"I'm back online reliably, and after reading kaido20's comment, I decided to seed again. Glad to see this torrent survived 6 months without the original file. I think I last seeded at less than 1000 downloads. Enjoy."

But how on earth could they forget about Hendrix..??!!! Unbelievable!!!!"
,Marcaul,2006-11-28T20:39Z,"I think they propably didn't but Hendrix in because he sort of represents a new era, while most of the stuff here is classic rock'n roll, although nowadays they think of Hendrix as classic too, he redefined rock and pushed its boundaries so far, including him would be not within the scope perhaps."
,CWNiles,2006-12-26T16:08Z,"Wow, great stuff. Thanks for sharing.

FYI. Disc 22, Track 2. It says the final track is 1967 Big Hits Collage but actually, after that is none other than Jimi Hendrix with Purple Haze.

,SirDuke_13,2008-10-27T01:52Z,"This is a great compilation
But not a great torrent. MP3s shouldn't be in .rar"
,edgarjwinter,2012-07-08T10:05Z,"Are there any more seeders out there? PB currently lists 2, but I've been trying to grab this for a couple of weeks now and am stuck at 77.9%. There's usually a seed listed but I never connect! If anybody can seed this, I'd be very grateful. Thanks!"
