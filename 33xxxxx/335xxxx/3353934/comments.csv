,david1,2005-07-13T12:27Z,Thank you!  Meshuggah is probably the best metal band out there right now! :)
,Bloodmouth,2005-07-15T14:43Z,"Yes, it is. :)"
,morb,2005-07-16T12:12Z,"yeah man, this is the fucking shit. i rocks like hell, mesuhggah is the best. i bought the album immediately when it came out, but thanks still, i have not had the time to rip it, so this will save the trouble :)"
,landenstad,2005-07-17T18:34Z,i hope this is the real deal 'cause i've downloaded several (promo) and they were all just one song but 10 tracks.
,lapa,2005-08-02T01:34Z,isnÂ´t the album actually one song cut to pieces?
,Bloodmouth,2005-08-04T15:50Z,"Yes, you can say so."
,jassodu,2006-03-06T14:28Z,"they are very good, but still, in flames is not to forget"
,WishboneAsh,2007-04-05T00:30Z,"GREAT, THEY PLAY IN GBG 30/6. I LOVE IT."
,PsychopathicMetal08,2008-09-10T18:57Z,.rar = epic fail :(
