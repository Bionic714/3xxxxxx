,spar77,2009-03-01T22:26Z,"After d/l'ing this torrent I tried to burn it but received an error stating the file size was not a multiple of a logical block size, therefore the video file allocation failed. When I tried to just play the files from my hard drive, 5 different playing programs failed to play the video. Anyone else having these issues?"
