I made this DVD using the original as base,
sincronysing the lyrics found on internet,
removing the stupid Creed intro before
each track and making the DVD playable
from start to end without user interaction.
That's my little contribution to the scene,
hope you all enjoy it as I do.
I only ask your help in the seeding process
when done downloading.
