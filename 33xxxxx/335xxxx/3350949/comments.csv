As always, thanks!"

You have 2 choices:
1. Mount it as an ISO.  Even if you run the updated menu program (that comes with the torrent) it will find the ISO mounted image (no matter what drive letter windows gives it).   I suggest use PowerISO or DaemonTools.

2. Make a drive D: (it has to be D: if you do it this way) and copy all the material onto it starting at the top level folder.  This is messy but does save you having to have an ISO mounted while you work.

Note - the DVD itself will use the primary sound driver, which could give you problems running Cubase at the same time, kind of defeats the purpose.  If your card is recent and your ASIO drivers are up to date and good, this should not be a problem.

And if you don't seed - please kill yourself now."

Seeders required, otherwise nobody will ever be able to figure out this ridiculously overcomplicated software."
