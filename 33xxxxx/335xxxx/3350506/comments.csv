You can't, without a 'modchip' for your PSX - Sony deliberately disabled the ability to play from CDR/CDRWs

Besides, the disks are PAL - make sure you have a PAL PSX (PAL is Europe/Asia) - if you got your PSX in the USA it is NTSC"

Only thing I had problems with was that stupid bios..
Wrote it into the adressbar, but geez.. :\  
The search engine absoloutely had to put in a ""WWW"". so the file didn't open.
I then figured out that if I just opened the file manually and used internet explorer as the main program for it, it would work. So I did and now it's all fine.

,pbransford,2007-08-01T21:41Z,"Can someone please explain why the torrent poster felt the need to archive the files first? You realize you can make a torrent of a whole directory, and the torrent clients can pick and choose what to download, and prioritize specific files?

I could be done with disk 1 completely and be playing now, while waiting for the others to finish, but I can't do that because it's one massive 7-zip archive.

PirateBay should have some kind of torrent-etiquette page or something, this kind of thing gets EXTREMELY annoying."
