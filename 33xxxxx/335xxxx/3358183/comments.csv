,mvk99,2005-07-20T05:54Z,wheres all the seeders?
,PetePetePete,2005-07-21T04:48Z,"Yeah your rips are great! :) I agree with chrojohnson though, you really should start seed they other two episodes. Thanks anyway!"
,Lightstrike,2005-07-22T00:32Z,I agree too. These last two has none so all you really need to do is get another seed going and move on to the next one. Thanks a lot for this though! It was a pleasant look back =D
,Lightstrike,2005-07-22T20:17Z,Sounds good. Thanks a lot!
,PetePetePete,2005-07-23T04:25Z,"Yeah, thanks :)
