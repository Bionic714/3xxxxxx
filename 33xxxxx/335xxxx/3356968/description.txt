Here's a bunch of rarities for you.  Witness the Beatles in animated form from their old cartoon series from the 60's during the height of Beatlemania.  Also included is an episode of Ralph Bakshi's cult classic 'Mighty Heroes' from the 60's.  

Bet you probablly didn't know Tom & Jerry had their own rarely seen show in the mid 70's. Included is an example from that show.  There are a few old silents from the 1920's that are pretty surreal to watch these days.  Gotta few Tex Avery MGM shorts in here that are hilarious!  

There are also a few banned cartoons in here as well such as 'Little Black Sambo', a very rare puppetoon from the 40's called 'Jasper And The Haunted House' and 'Inki and the Minah Bird' from Warner Bros. that hasn't been on the television in ages.
