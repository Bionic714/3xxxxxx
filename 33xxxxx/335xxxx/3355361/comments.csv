,MikeCock,2010-04-25T07:16Z,"Wow, no offense to anyone, but ""Dr. Love"" should take a writing class or at least get his GED.  Trying to read this ""book"" was like trying to read the writings of a retarded monkey, although something tells me a retarded monkey would do better in the grammar and editing process than Dr. Love ever could."
