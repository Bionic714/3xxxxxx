This is the full version of Metal Gear Solid for PC (Konami calls it Metal Gear Solid:Integral) including the VR missions and all audio/video. Mount the two ISO's to CD's, install and play! You can emulate them but you must keep the images because the game requires the CD's unless you have a no-cd crack. I haven't included one because I couldn't find one and I'm no cracker. Besides, burning 2 CD's to save 1GB of HD space isn't that bad of a trade off.
