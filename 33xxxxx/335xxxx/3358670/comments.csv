,UnknownX,2006-03-23T03:52Z,Game always screws up just before the electrical floor place. Sorry but this game is just unplayable for me after that.

,Rakinite,2007-02-16T03:12Z,"I know it's a good idea to seed, but that doesn't mean you SHOULDN'T do it"
,Rakinite,2007-02-16T16:17Z,"Seriously, you need to seed. That's the point of the torrent architecture."
,domientius,2007-03-22T21:00Z,"MegaGames has a working no-cd crack. You might want to run a full install of the game to use it though.

Also set compatibility mode to Windows 2000 or so as XP hates this game. Even so, I still get minor sound issues(left channel only, some codec voices not playing). Of course, this game looks only slightly better than the PS1 version, you may wanna get the Gamecube version if that matters. "
,domientius,2007-03-22T21:04Z,"megagames DOT com SLASH cracks SLASH html SLASH c32510_0 DOT htm

Sorry, but I get a ""database error"" when I try to post a direct link

download the UK/US crack and replace both EXE files with these. Keeping in mind that under XP, you likely won' get the game to run properly with the CDs in even if it's a legit copy thanks to SafeDisc."
,perseus22,2007-04-29T20:49Z,is there anyone who still seed?? or should i download this somewhere else? 
,Yitih1234,2007-05-21T17:16Z,uhm. this is takinga very long time. everything was good until about 70% when suddenly my DL speed dropped for 60-70kbps to 5
,solid_stephen,2007-06-04T03:47Z,hey i downloaded the game it works but im having a problem at the part where u put in the pal keys after that the room fills up with gas otocon opens the door but it doesnt open!!! anyone having this problem!!!???!!!
,qsgqsdfhgsdfh,2007-08-10T12:00Z,"1. download.
2. extract with winrar
3. use powerISO or Daemon tools to mount the      isofiles
4. install
5. download crack from this link http://www.freeinfosociety.com/site.php?postnum=883
6. repalce crack files with original files
7. start the game

The crack for VR missions is included. This game works 100% with me so stop whining."
,DreadlordX,2007-08-24T02:04Z,WTF...:Is it cause im runnin it with XP that movies dont show?
,Perza^,2007-09-16T16:53Z,SEED pls
,Perza^,2007-09-22T15:46Z,"I have the same problem than you solid_stephen. The command room door, won't open. It just stays closed, but gas disappears. 

If I call to otacon again, he says ""What are you doing? The door is open. hurry up!"". 

Does anybody know what to do? or to download some else crack or something?"
,solid_stephen,2007-09-25T08:59Z,it never worked so i just uninstalled it i was so fucking pissed

,imlkrsfn,2007-12-22T20:56Z,When it asks for cd 1 just put in the cd of any game you have or mount an image of a game.  I used need for speed 3 image with damontools and it worked.

,ww88,2008-03-02T15:19Z,"you´ll have to do as here on this picture
http://www.metalgearsolid.cz/images/clanky/obsah/!zmensene/6.jpg
you´ll have to right click on the mgsi.exe and select properties, there you have to set compatibility and procced as in the picture;) i hope it will help"
,truthy,2008-03-05T03:42Z,"unless you have a VERY OLD PC there's no way this will work! Compatibility-Mode no use too! All the available cracks crash the game and the mini-images don't work either. You might be more lucky with a ATI-Card, but i doubt it will run on a 'modern' system ...

I downloaded the PSX-Version http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3737431/Metal_Gear_Solid_1_PSX_2nd_upload and emulated it trough ePSXe. Worked fine even with XP and my GeForce 8 - I used the Pete's OpenGL2 Driver 2.8 with high settings as a video plugin and of course my controller.

thx for the torrent - too bad it doesn't work."
,solid_snake24,2008-03-09T01:59Z,"hey guys i've FOUND A WAY TO PLAY METAL GEAR ON PC!!! first download another torrent called Metal Gear Solid [PC version], that has about 730 MB. After the download extract the setup and install the game, but this torrent has a problem... it needs a CD and the crack doesn't work! So, you download this torrent, extract the images and burn them into a CD. Then, use these cd's to play the game that you installed from the other torrent (do not install the game from this torrent)!!! That way, you WON'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM IN OPENING THE DOOR IN THE ROOM FILLED WITH GAS! cause it's not played from this torrent, you just use the cd's... got it? :)  But i have one question, even though i managed to play the game, i can't see the videos, can someone tell me how to solve that?"
,looking54,2008-03-21T12:21Z,"I think i know why the game does not work for some people , it could be you are using duo processor and multi-threading , there was a fix for system shock 2 called image config , i will do the same with this game and post back on the result"
,djejka,2008-04-03T17:48Z,this shit alwaysw asking for disc 1.... what to do???

im on the stage where you fight mantis, the telekenetic dude. after i knock meryl out for the 2nd or 3rd time (cant remember), it goes into a cut scene, and then the camera focuses on snake.

,jbwzrd213,2008-04-30T00:56Z,"I don't know what's with all of you people. Mine worked perfectly. Just download Infrarecorder and burn the image (ISO) to a disk. Then just pop them in and it works perfectly.

The only problem I'm having is that it keeps messing up when I die. That happening to anyone else?"
,Jesse_Kessu,2008-05-30T18:00Z,The game wont work in some never video cards including mine :( It says that the game doesent support this video card and it will start rendering but it will only fuck up your font :D
,Aquahutch,2008-06-17T01:08Z,"Go here and read the entire forum thread, guys. Some solutions have been found to get this running properly:

,alphakeyes,2008-06-18T22:46Z,"I cant find what file to mount in daemon tools. If you know could you give me the file name, because i tried mounting almost everthing but it still asks to insert disk 1 and restart the application. help please."
,Diceman_,2008-06-25T16:34Z,"Mine is running on XP with an ATI 9550 and mounted with Daemon Tools, however my USB controller won't work with it. It recognises all the buttons and axes in the key configuration screen but snake is still uncontrollable, even after trying all the compatibility settings. 

I'm not sure if I really want to play MGS with a keyboard so I might have to dust off my PS2, adjust the laser and see if some old burns of MGS still work."
,gewalt,2008-06-27T15:07Z,I got it to work but there doesn't seem to be any voice-overs in the Briefing option and dialogue after the first part of the game.

,Spacey94,2009-07-08T17:00Z,"I found out how to fix the problem with the pal keys:

1: Using MS-DOS prompt, start the game with the command line ""mgsi.exe -cheatenable.""

2: press F7, this will respawn you out side the door where you'll see liquid running away.

3. Call Otacon he'll say he opened the door, and tah dah fixed."
