In these times, when the US is going more and more fascist and right-wing some artist still remain independent and still fight against their corrupt and racism regime. I've tried to make a compilation of old and new song with some of these artist. There are most likely some that you think should be on a album like this, if so please comment or make your own. Spread the word.

The purpose of this compilation to show some of the American revolutionary left and their message...and to give people some real Hip-Hop to listen to.

Enjoy.
