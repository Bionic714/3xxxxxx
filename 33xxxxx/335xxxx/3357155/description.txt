I downloaded the ia64 bit version of debian gnu/linux yesterday, and because i wanted the dvd did i use the jigdo file. So here it comes for those who want it. md5sums are included in the map. I might be down, but promise to come back. Have a nice day with the greatest gnu/linux system out there. This is the first dvd of three. But i think this is enough. The rest is easy through apt-get or aptitude
