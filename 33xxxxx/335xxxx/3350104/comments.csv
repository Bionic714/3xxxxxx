,shareadictos,2005-06-29T21:31Z,NisseNiding the funny thing is that in my PC the file is perfect. I just created a new torrent based on the same file that I used before. That's why I do not understand the reason of this. I just realized that some of you had problems through a post of Hamdi in www.shareadictos.com.
