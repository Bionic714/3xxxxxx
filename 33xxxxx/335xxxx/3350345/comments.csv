Install the Steinberg Cubase SX 3 DVD.

2. 
Download Cubase SX 3 from H20, and install this one over the full DVD version.
(you can download it from: ""http://vanix.net/search.php?search=cubase+3""

3.
Now you will have the full DvD version, cracked by the good people of H20.

ENJOY!!!!!!"

,Leenix20,2009-03-20T19:41Z,"I finally found the solution guys :) To Vista and XP 64 or 32 bit.

1) Get this torrent. It is Zipped up all it needs is just to extract, and as small as hell, no more downloading those bullshit 1gb Cubase Torrents.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4212016/Cubase_Studio_4.1.1_by_Antony_GR_(Portable___Non-Install_version


Then go here and Download the Asio4all Driver.
It wil Reduce Latency on Which All Midi Works.
Meaning if you use Ezdrummer as a trigger for your Electric Drums and have 1 Second delays, this is a MUST. Even if you dont have Edrums YOU MUST INSTALL IT.
http://www.asio4all.com/


Now for Ezdrummer.
Get this Torrent, it Includes Both the Ezdrummer Installation and the Drumkit from Hell which is 100 times better than the standard Ezdrummer Kit.

And Finally update Ezdrummer with this Patch, it will add a couple of new features in Ezdrummer and make a noticable sound fix to your drums.

No more need to look here and there for shitty torrents that dont work on Vista. THIS IS THE SOLUTION FINALLY."
