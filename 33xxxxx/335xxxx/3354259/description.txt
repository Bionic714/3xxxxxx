Swedish post-punks The Je Ne Sais Quoi played an extra-special show at Debaser in Stockholm on June 18 with all sorts of special guests appearing on every song, including scene luminaries such as Ed Greene, Andreas Söderström, Knife and Ape, John (Bad Monkey), ASSID, Kate Riff (Soviac) and their sixth member Gabriel. This is a live recording of that show with improved sound from the mixingdesk.
