Review by Scott Yanow 
The third of four LPs issued by Rosetta in its Independent Women's Blues series has 16 blues and jazz recordings, one apiece from Ida Cox, Bertha Idaho, Helen Humes (in 1927), Sara Martin, Mildred Bailey, Sweet Peas Spivey, Lil Johnson, Trixie Smith, Susie Edwards, Lucille Bogan, Cleo Gibson, Martha Copeland, Edith Johnson, Albennie Jones, Lizzie Miles and Ella Fitzgerald. Many of these valuable performances are still quite rare and have not yet been reissued on CD.
