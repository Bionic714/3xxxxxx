THE SHORT FILMS OF JIM VAN BEBBER
=================================

Roadkill - the last days of John Martin (1988)
filmed during the production of Deadbeat at Dawn, this sick little short was proposed to be a full length feature... but as with most JVB flicks the backing never arrived!

Chunk Blower (1990)
another never made feature. this showreel/trailer was the only footage shot.

My Sweet Satan (1993)
short film based on a true story. made during the decade of production on Charlie's Family. ...definitely a very freaky flick!


anyone wanting more JVB should message me, i've also got DEADBEAT AT DAWN (1988), CHARLIE'S FAMILY (workprint 1996) and the proper release version, THE MANSON FAMILY (2003)

But, are you worthy of the title 'uploader of a *really* far-out movie'
