I am going to seed the entire 12-disc finale to Mosaic Record's 3-volume vinyl collection (originally totalling 66 LPs, now out of print and never available on CD). However, first I wanted to showcase my favorite recordings from Vol 3, those of the piano player, Peck Kelly, who chose to stay in his native Texas despite numerous attempts by notable jazz figures at the time to lure him away. Enjoy.
