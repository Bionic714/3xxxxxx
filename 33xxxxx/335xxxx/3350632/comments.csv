,nt_007,2005-06-30T22:53Z,People posting torrents like this should be banned.
,urmamma,2005-06-30T23:18Z,"nt_007, why?"
,zz,2005-07-01T03:17Z,this is the best video player out there besides zoom player pro.
,nt_007,2005-07-01T11:29Z,"First thing is that this is missing any info what the program is or does.
Second it is far more easier and faster to download this from sourceforge."
,nt_007,2005-07-01T16:35Z,"""This a version of the classic media player as you can understand. It doesn't eat as much memoy as the XP windows media player."" Yeah nice info...
You could have this torrent removed and upload another one.
Or you could have posted missing info in your first post.
Supports DVD, Matroska, OGM, AC3, DTS, with Real/Quicktime Alternative Real Media/Quicktime support and so on...
But you just chose to release with no value just to get your ratio better."
,urmamma,2005-07-01T18:27Z,"Listen you fat fuck, I doesn't care about my ratio. I uploaded this shit because I think its a good program that other people should use, you are the only one that have been crying about it. Do you know why? Because you are a fat jerk without any friends, and you are probably still a virgin too. Fucking loser."
