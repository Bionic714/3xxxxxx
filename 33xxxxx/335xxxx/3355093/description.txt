Newest Gorillaz video, converted from .mov to .avi with Quicktime Pro. Looks a bit fuzzy when viewed at full screen, but so does the original .mov. 
If you'd like to view/download the original .mov, it's located at:

This is a goofy, cute and funny video, a nice change in pace from the wistful Feel Good Inc. The ending is especially laughable. 
Enjoy!
