,Growf,2005-07-18T02:04Z,Does anyone know if the Stephen Fry release is available?  I've grown to like his voice and reading style...
,themacguy2k,2005-07-18T07:29Z,I am with Growf. I can't stand Jim Dale
,spectral2k,2005-07-18T08:13Z,Has this one been checked and confirmed that the book is all in the right order? The other one on piartebay people are reporting it being a littlel messed up and I dont want to listen to it until I know that its all right.
,living420,2005-07-18T16:19Z,"I added the fixed files. It should be correct. But, it's true I really haven't listened to this version myself.

I'm listening to the aac version. Would have used it for this, but I couldn't merge together aac correctly like I could with mp3 and copying and pasting it all together in QT is just too much work for me."

,w000ter,2005-07-20T11:40Z,what is a .mov file besides apple quicktime?
,living420,2005-07-20T23:34Z,"it's a QT mov because it's the MP3 version of the audiobook contained inside a QT mov with chapter markers. see:
