The major focus for this past year has been producing our premium double CD release entitled "Themes For Orchestra & Choir". We recorded 45 original compositions as well as over a dozen orchestral and choral rises, utilizing a 106 member orchestra and 70 voice choir. Nearly all of the tracks have Choir and Non-Choir (NC) versions. 
This project was also produced in full surround with the 5.1 mixes available upon request. Licensing fees for "Themes For Orchestra & Choir" are higher than our standard rates. 

These cues were specifically designed for the high-end trailer market and can be heard "bringing home" the end of current film campaigns such as:
