,mycarrion2,2005-07-06T00:33Z,"Just jumped on here and watched the seeds drop from 24 to 9 in 20 minutes.  Should take me a full day to get this at the rate things are going.  C'mon guys, stick around for a while to keep things flowing.

Sorry TCA, but I'll be sure to let you know how it looks on my end if I can get it.

Regards."
,mycarrion2,2005-07-06T07:37Z,"Looks great TCA!  It's Ell-Ess-Dee's take converted to DVD format, yes?"
,TheCoolArrow,2005-07-06T09:25Z,"""Ell-Ess-Dee's take converted to DVD format, yes?""

Correct...converted to NTSC (US) DVD. Plus added the two alternate audio tracks.  Whatever Ell Ess Dee did with his video, it held up well in the conversion! I was thinking in hindsight it would also be fun to have the US MTV audio track, complete with cut to commercials in Comfortable Numb.  Or maybe not..."
,EmesiS,2005-07-07T01:58Z,"Funny one TheCoolArrow....I was watching it on MTV and I could not believe they cut into the song like that during one of the best guitar solo's of all time. Bet if it was 50cent or some rapper they wouldn't have cut into it. Stupid kids nowdays don't know what good music is, damn I sound like my dad :) Anyway thanx so much to Ell-Ess-Dee and you TheCoolArrow for ripping this. It actually brought a tear to my eye and sent chills through me when I heard and saw these guys back together again. I wish they would do one last tour for all of us that missed them before. Thanx again you did a great job! "

,StardustVI,2005-07-18T22:52Z,"Unknown URL Type?
Why is download imposible?"
,BeeOhBee,2005-07-26T02:36Z,I am having a hard time burning this. I can only burn it as a Data DVD and that wont work in my DVD player. If anyone has any suggestion i would appreciate it. I tried Roxio DVD burner but it converts the files and in doing so it is too large for a disc. Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks!
,TheCoolArrow,2005-07-28T16:55Z,BeeOhBee:  Download a free 30-day eval of Nero and try that.  Burn it as a DVD Video.  Just drag over the contents of the VIDEO_TS folder and go.
