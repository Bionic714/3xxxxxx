This is a DVD Rip of disc one, season one, of Chris Carter's ("The X-Files") "Millennium", starring Lance Henriksen as retired FBI profiler Frank Black.

After quitting the bureau, Frank moves his family to Seattle, Washington and
begins work as a private consultant for the mysterious Millennium Group. Is he
only helping them solve grisly crimes beyond the scope of local law enforce-
ment, or is all the murder and mayhem pointing to an escalating, apocolyptic
battle of good versus evil?

Disc one has four episodes: the pilot, Gehenna, Dead Letters and The Judge. 
This rip includes special features.
