This is train-wreck pop, obliterating the boundaries between high and low art. For my money, this is just about as good as pop music can get. While their releases on the Geographic label may serve as a point of introduction to Maher Shalal Hash Baz for most people, the bandâ€™s mastermind, Tori Kudo, is already an underground legend in Tokyo, having put out records for over two decades. So it is absolutely baffling that it has taken so long for MSHB's music to see the light of day in the West. The appearance of Blues du Jour alone is testament to the positive effects of globalization. The unique underground Japanese group Maher Shalal Hash Baz -- a mostly.. untrained.. ensemble that plays simple, psychedelic pop songs with child-like innocence and imprecison
