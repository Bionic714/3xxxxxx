Hong Kong Phooey, if you haven't seen it check the IMDB link above.

A description here is not really needed, it's Hong Kong Phooey, 'nuff said. There are 8 episodes, 2 are in the same file and the quality is pretty good considering these are pretty old.

If you haven't already, check out Nostalgia Tracker, has some stuff you haven't seen in a long time.
