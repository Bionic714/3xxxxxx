,Saikano,2005-07-18T18:04Z,WOOAAH!!! That f*ckin raawks!!! but what the f*ck is wrong with that policeman? :P
,Roger525,2005-07-18T21:02Z,"Saikano, you're a retard. You were involved in making that film yourself, saying that ""it f*ckin raawks!!!"" is pretty stupid don'cha think? :P

It's not all that impressive really.. just some copy driving over CJ, which kills him."
,Saikano,2005-07-18T21:55Z,"Roger525: just because you're jealous of this mindblowing stunt it does'nt mean you have to shit in your pants and cry like a six year old.
Comit suicide or something, at least you would do yourself a favor by doing so"
,GoldDog,2005-07-18T22:38Z,"Seriously, what's impressive about this?

The player jumps out of a car and gets hit by another car. Is that all?"
,santadog,2005-07-18T23:28Z,"lol...when ppl write about themself as some kind of celebrities it's pathetic.. get a life.
and btw, the clip is nothing special at all. lame"
,trickykid,2005-07-19T14:30Z,Sorry... but I too think this sucked.
,M3rley,2005-07-24T23:47Z,Is that supposed to be insane? That ain't even a stunt.. It aint even mindblowing or impressive. And what's with that shitty music?
,Wompa,2005-08-13T10:59Z,This suck.. my kusin that is 6 years old can do att better stunt... This really suck
,Dason BoY,2006-08-06T12:53Z,"ok, this maybe isnÂ´t that ""mind blowing"" as it is supposed to be, atleast you can figure that out by reading the comments lol :P"
