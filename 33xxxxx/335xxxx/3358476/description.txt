A neglected aspect of the Iraq War comes into focus in this documentary by filmmaker Roel van Broekhoven, profiling the individual stories of six critically wounded American veterans as they adjust to their injuries. Some have lost arms or legs, others suffer from blindness or trauma. Hailed as heroes at home, the soldiers in Purple Hearts speak longingly of a desire to return to duty. Yet their future remains problematic, as American society grows increasingly ambivalent about the war and the military fails to create a place for them.
