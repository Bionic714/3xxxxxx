Bruce Sprinsteen solo accoustic in Gothenburg 23 june 2005.

June 23 / Gothenberg, SWE / Scandinavium

Notes: An astounding setlist, start to finish, in Gothenberg 
-- where they're surely accustomed to such things, but still. 
Let's start with the true jaw-dropper of the night: "Fade Away," played by request. 
The second single from The River had been inexplicably left to vanish in the night of decades passed, 
but it came out tonight on electric piano/piano 
(there's hope for "The Price You Pay" yet, folks!). 
"Into the Fire" opened the set, 
which also included "Highway 29"; "Incident" into "Real World" at the piano; 
both "State Trooper" and "Highway Patrolman"; "Racing," "Lucky Town," "Cadillac Ranch," 
a surprise "Maria's Bed" in the encore... 
All in all, looks like this one's hard to top
