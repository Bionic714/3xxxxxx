,Dynamitee,2005-07-14T07:55Z,:) I actually wanted to make a torrent too but I messed it up and now my ip has changed WAH!.
,Thorneater,2007-01-28T00:34Z,"1.5 isn't that buggy!!!
I've been using it for TCE(an Enemy Territory mod) for a long time and I haven't had any problems. but u might wanna install 1.4 too, to compile.

BTW, this kinda stuf can also been downed from the official radiant site. Might go faster for some ppl..."
