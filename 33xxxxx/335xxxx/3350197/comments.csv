From the Windows desktop, select the Start button, right-click on the My Computer icon, and select Properties from the resulting menu.

In the Performance Options window, click on the Advanced tab to bring it forward, and then select the Change button in the Virtual Memory section.

Perform one of the following setting changes to resolve this issue:

Select the button next to System managed size.

Select SET to accept the change, which will close the Virtual Memory window. Select OK to close the Performance Options window. And select OK to exit the System Properties window.
