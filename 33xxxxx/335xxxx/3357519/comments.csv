,jamess1981,2006-10-07T10:00Z,Thankyou very much an excellent upload :D
,Swestoffe,2007-03-20T08:21Z,Yeah that worked really well in the former Soviet Union and others. Death and hunger is what the communistic government uses to stay in power. Socialitic government punish the successful by helping the unsuccessful. Not a fair deal according to me. 
,mich-valee,2007-08-24T11:22Z,"pleas seed, stuck on 67.8%"
,mbueno,2007-09-02T18:19Z,"@ kamukaze 
What an irony that you mentioned hunger and death considering the legacy of maoism, stalinism (both killed an estimated 100 million people) and the khmer rouge (killed more of its own population than any other government in history)!
There is this anecdote about Krushchev coming to visit the US and being taken to a visit to a supermarket. He believed it was a fake thing to impress him.
I think that your name really suits your ideas, dude!"

,rahman605,2008-07-28T15:47Z,"Lately, I have been experiencing freezes from this game which completely render my interface useless forcing me to restart my computer. Does anyone else experience these problems and is there a remedy to it?"
,ajtheman,2009-06-27T21:29Z,"I think the kind of government Kamukaze is talking about is a democratic socialism, like they have in some European countries. They seem to work very good, in my opinion.

Communism doesn't work because they've all been initiated in poor countries. Karl Marx himself said that Communism is the next form of government after Capitalism; he said that a country needed to be Capitalist for a while to build up a good amount of wealth, and then it should be communist because there was enough wealth to be redistributed so everyone has enough money to live comfortably. 

In these countries like Cuba, China, and Russia, the countries were already poor so the only thing they redistributed was hunger, poverty, and sorrow.

On the other hand, if you don't care about loss of human life, Stalinism was probably one of the most efficient governments in the modern age. They brought Russia up from fucking dirt into a superpower by the time of the Cold War. Of course, they killed more of their own people than Hitler killed anyone, so you have to take that into account."

,BigD145,2010-01-20T04:39Z,Communism has never been tried on a country scale.
,Khono,2010-03-04T19:57Z,"Political discussion: It is my belief that brief, several word descriptions of societal models (like ""communism"", ""democratic socialism"", ""constitutional monarchy"", etc) should not be compared as, all too often, we're judging them based on the manufactured image of these systems which, far too often, has very little resemblance to how these systems actually work in each state.  

For example, many people consider the United States to be a democracy (and there are many other, more specific terms).  Yet the only (official) way most Americans participate in governing their state(s)/nation is by voting.  The group/person with the most votes takes all the power in each 'battle' (simplification), thus requiring any potential winner to go as broad-based as possible, following mainstream majority opinions (or at least appearing to) as closely as possible.  This, of course, alienates those who don't hold mainstream majority opinions.  Then there's the whole problem with manufacturing consent, the manufacture of mainstream knowledge/opinions via the major media outlets which are owned by coroporations who also tend to be the ones that control which candidates make it far enough to be voted on (huge oversimplification).  This description is a massive oversimplification but it's already sooo much more complicated than the several term comparison of systems people usually do.  

So I guess my point is, instead of advocating for a generalized, top-down model which can't be known first-hand, why don't we deal with specific issues at local levels?  Things that we have first-hand knowledge of which tend to skip over much of the most high-level propaganda."

""I think the kind of government Kamukaze is talking about is a democratic socialism, like they have in some European countries. They seem to work very good, in my opinion.""

Wrong, thats not socialism, its social democracy which rejected marxism and ironically relies heavily on capitalism to generate wealth and then ""redistribute"" it ""to the poor"".... frankly I think is statist bullshit.

""Communism doesn't work because they've all been initiated in poor countries. Karl Marx himself said that Communism is the next form of government after Capitalism""

Marx also said that the socialis state will magically ""wither away to give birth to the communist society""....... please, the man was a glorified pseudo-philosopher.

@ BigD145
""Communism has never been tried on a country scale.""

LOL"
,americanderp,2011-04-27T02:40Z,"i thought that in the demo you could just save it reload it and it would be full version?
