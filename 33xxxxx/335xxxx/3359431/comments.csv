,BlackDahlia,2007-04-30T19:00Z,"First of all, why .rar a file with one file and a compression ratio of 1%? It merely adds an unnecessary step to the download process.

Second, the .avi file would not play in VLC Media Player until I took out the trash in the file name and reduced it to TRON.AVI. Worked fine after that."
