99.9% for about 5 days."
,kornkob1995,2005-07-26T02:13Z,I dont really know why it did that. You were the first I hear there was a problem. Is it the program you are using? I made it in Azureus and then tried to download it myself on Bitlord and it worked. I hope you got it to download because they are really good albums. Sorry I am not much help
