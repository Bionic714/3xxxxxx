[T],wazits,2008-10-01T23:07Z,If ashdevill77 is still online could you upload this again & re-seed . STOPS at 96.6 1-04 - Fatherland & 2-10 Shellshocked (Demo) won't Seed. Would appreciate It MUCH. Thank-You!!!! The Rest Is Excellent Quality & I Don't Know Why more sites don't have this torrent. Da** Good.
,mr_ajnin,2009-05-31T07:06Z,"OK. EVERYONE, Delete both of those files that aren't downloading. Then remove the torrent. RE-Download the torrent and run it. It should work then. I'll seed it for a little longer. I'll be on annd off for the next few days after that, you're screwed."
,mr_ajnin,2009-05-31T07:11Z,"Forget that. Just goto: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4440989/Die_Krupps-Part_I-Studio  And get it from there. That wat you'll get it at 256kb/s instead of 192. You're all dumb,"
,subseeker,2011-02-04T17:47Z,"mr_ajnin, I think you're the dumb one on this one, both of these are DEAD."
