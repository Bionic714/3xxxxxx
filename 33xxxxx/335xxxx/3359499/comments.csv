,jazhall_uk,2005-07-31T01:49Z,"I had to signup to leave a comment but whatever, you did an amazing job on this and you deserve the credit. Thanks a LOT for this, I'm a big Eminem collector and although I wasn't necessarily looking for this, I found it and was really impressed. By the way, you're right, scene rips are definitely better than home-made ones."
