Release notes:

The special thing about this release is that these albums are all scene rips. None of 
that homemade shit! The scene tested, the scene aproved ;) I spent quite a few hours
putting this stuff together, because the old albums are fucking hard to find, so I had
to build this release from scrap so that the original SFVs would check out, so I hope
you'll enjoy this. Thanks to RNS & KSi for the awesome rips! Like it? N'Joy! Hate it?
Go fuck yourself.
