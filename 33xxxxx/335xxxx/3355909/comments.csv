,makeupfx,2005-07-14T12:19Z,I played it with Power DVD and it worked
,Clown029,2005-07-14T13:57Z,I believe the person named it wrong should be boycotted.  Think the catholic church boycotted this episode i do not believe the FCC banned this episode or showtime would not let them air it. I beleive it aired on showtime on July 4th.
,JohnOrgasm,2005-07-14T22:07Z,"It wasn't banned at all. Someone didn't sign a release waiver so the show was pulled for legal reasons. This release exists for us to download because it was accidentally available on Showtime on Demand in Illinois.

This is a great episode btw. Religious icons are the indeed bullshit."
,wikkel,2005-07-15T15:15Z,"great epsiode,those religious nuts wil believe anything,hilarious :o)"

,hades480bc,2008-01-17T19:21Z,"This is not episode 10 (the missing ""banned"" one). This is episode 12 ""Signs from Heaven""."
,guppygrrl,2009-07-15T18:59Z,"hades480bc, what are you talking about? I was under the impression that S03EP10 *was* Signs From Heaven, and S03EP12 was Endangered Species. Dunno if Signs From Heaven is supposed to be the banned one or if it replaced whatever the banned one was (couldn't they have just blurred the non-release-signer's face out or something?)."
,guppygrrl,2009-07-15T19:25Z,"n/m, I found an incorrectly labeled listing before.  Anyone know what the ""banned"" episode is supposed to be about? Is it really the Ghostbusters one or is that a 'replacement' episode of some kind?"
