Release Notes:

The history of Europe began on 1979, when Joey Tempest makes a
group named FORCE. Only one year after, Force records its first
demo-tape. In that time, FORCE is formed by Joey Tempest on
vocals, John Norum on guitar, Peter Olsson playing the bass and
Tony Reno on drums. The demo-tape gets a negative response from
the record companies. 1 year after, Peter decides to leave the
group, and he is replaced by John LevTn.

In 1982, it comes the big step to the rock starship: they win a
rock talent contest and they record their first Lp. At that moment
they change the name and their rename to EUROPE.

In 1983 japan discovers the group. One year after Mich Michaeli is
recluted to play keyboards, and the band releases their second
album: "Wings Of Tomorrow". Europe conquers all Scandinavia and
Japan, and Tony Reno leaves the group and is replaced by Ian
Haugland. And it arrives 1986. The great year of EUROPE. They
released the great number one of the band: THE FINAL CONTDOWN,
they sell more than 6 millions of copys and more than 8 millions
of the single contdown. They just have conquered the world. They
tour all the world and John Norum is replaced by Kee Marcello when
he decides to leave the band.

In 1988 they release OUT OF THIS WORLD, and continue touring all
over the world. 1991: Their new brand album PRISIONERS IN PARADISE
don't have a good response of the company, who thinks that Europe
is not a US group, and decide not to give support to the album.
After that Joey decides to do a new album of greats hits, and
makes EUROPE 1982-1992.

Throughout their journey they are continuing to make new albums
and remake the old ones in various styles, Europe Lives On...

Enjoy
