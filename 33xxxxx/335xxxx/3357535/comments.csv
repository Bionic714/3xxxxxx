,Hexy,2005-08-02T03:48Z,"I hate when they dub it to german its like... they have to imitate EVERYTHING!!!

think about some woman voice acting ""Oooh ja! oooh ja so gott! oooo!"" for the next 17 minutes."
,Stitchz,2005-08-04T13:02Z,why is spoken language listed in english if it's dubbed to german?  I'd maybe d/l if it were subs but nah just my preference.  thanks anyway
