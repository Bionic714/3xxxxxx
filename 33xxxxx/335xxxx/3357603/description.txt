This might have been uploaded before - I cant remember really, its not anyhwere on the bay now as of today, so atleast its not a dupe. 

First scheduled for release in 1974, this second album from the Swedish progressive/psychedelic rock band better known as Garden of The Elks was finally released in 2001 It's been worth the wait - this is a strong set of originals drenched with mellotrons, moogs, sitars, guitars and electric violins that alternately resembles Hawkwind, King Crimson and High Tide. Superb!
