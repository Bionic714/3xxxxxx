Nine-year-old Frankie and his  single mum Lizzie have been on the  
move ever  since Frankie can remember,  most recently arriving in  
a seaside Scottish town. Wanting to protect her deaf son from the  
truth that they've run away from his father,  Lizzie has invented  
a story that he is away at sea on the HMS Accra. Every few weeks,
Lizzie writes  Frankie a  make-believe  letter  from  his father,    
telling of his adventures in exotic lands.  As Frankie tracks the    
ship's progress around the globe,  he discovers that it is due to  
dock in his hometown.  With the real HMS Accra arriving in only a  
fortnight,  Lizzie must choose  between telling Frankie the truth  
or finding the perfect stranger to play Frankie's father for just    
one day...
