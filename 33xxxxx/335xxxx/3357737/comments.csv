,snakeboy,2005-07-19T12:07Z,"you're right, it's VIII (8), sorry
evo 9 is on sale on some markets, soon in europe"
,M0b1u5,2006-08-22T04:40Z,"It's not even an ""Evo 8"" - it is a special edition by Mitsubishi (Britain) putting out 400 BHP. It needs servicing (1500 pounds sterling worth) every 3,500 miles. A set of tyres will last less than 2 hours. It is almost impossible to get away without stalling or spinning the wheels....

The problem is, this is only HALF the video article. The second half tells you what a load of shite this car is, and how the unmodified Evo 8 is a much better car, even though it WON'T push a Murci' off the road in any way, shape or form.

Yes, it really is a giggle to see this video, but IN NO WAY IS AN EVO ANYWHERE CLOSE TO A LAMBORGHINI.

See, I said it: Evo = OK, Lamborghini = fucking brilliant. 'Nuff said."
,g25racer,2008-02-07T23:25Z,Correct it's not an evo 8 even. Do your research!! It's an fq400! You can't even get one of these in the u.s.
,g25racer,2008-02-07T23:26Z,HAHA!! An evo will smoke a lambo. I would take an evo over a piece of crap show car like a lambo. Evo rules bitch!!
