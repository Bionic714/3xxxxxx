Great EP. The first track is the title track and only original on the EP, it's classic Tossers, fast Irish-Punk. It later appeared on the latest album "Purgatory". It also features two great up-beat covers of the traditional "Dicey Rily" and "Donegal Danny", a beautiful cover of Bob Dylan's "Seven Curses", and the final track is Jerry Lee Lewis's "Rockin My Life Away", pure banjo plucking bad ass boogie woogie rock'n'roll. 

Cheers.
