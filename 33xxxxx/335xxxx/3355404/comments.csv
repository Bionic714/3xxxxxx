,CVonV,2005-07-13T20:42Z,any chance of releasing season 1?
,zonesch,2005-07-14T14:58Z,Season 01 => http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3355385
,greet,2005-07-20T13:26Z,"Is there something wrong with this file? I tried to play the first two episodes (those already finished downloading) with every player I have on this computer (VLC, DivX, W. Mediaplayer, BS) and they won't play. At all!
GSpot even says the file's not a valid avi file!! 

Or will the episodes only play when I've finished downloading every single episode? 

Anyone else has this problem?"
,zonesch,2005-07-20T22:19Z,"Hello greet

I checked all files with GSpot V2.21 and they're ok! Codec is Xvid. I use ZoomPlayer (http://www.inmatrix.com/files/zoomplayer_download.shtml) to watch the files."
,greet,2005-07-21T08:13Z,"Thanks zonesch, but I downloaded that zoomplayer you suggested and it's not working either. It says: 
""Error. Unable to play [Felicity 2x01 Sophomoric.avi] This may be due to a corrupt file, missing filters, filter conflicts or hardware related issues.""
When I tried to play the second one, I didn't get a message like this, I just got a blank screen and on the bottom it said the episode is around 2 minutes long.
That's another thing, when I look at the details of the files, there are no minutes/seconds under the lenght-part of the videofile. That's just blank.

I don't get it! I don't understand why it won't work."
,MaXXXXX,2005-07-21T14:28Z,I guess the d/l is not over yet...
,zonesch,2005-07-22T11:58Z,Hi greet. Have you installed the codec for Xvid? => http://www.inmatrix.com/zplayer/formats/xvid.shtml
,greet,2005-07-23T08:00Z,"Yes, I have that ..."
,hadarw,2005-07-23T15:01Z,"I use VLC and the first episode works just fine :) At first there was no pic, but then I just fullscreened it and voila...  it worked."
,greet,2005-07-29T19:14Z,"I re-downloaded the second episode through BitComet (because I can select just 1 episode though that program) and it clearly says it has downloaded the full 100% and the episode just won't play!!! I have never had a problem like this before - I've downloaded plenty of avi files and they always work perfectly on this computer! :(

Meh. This sucks! I've been searching for these episodes for so long! (I would buy the DVD but they're not released over here.) "
,greet,2005-07-30T20:11Z,"Well, thank you kaptenkongo!! I'm not the only one having problems (sucks for you too of course)!! I doubt it's a problem with BitComet though, I used Bittornado at first and it didn't work after downloading with that either.
At first I too thought that it was just a matter of having to download all the episodes or something, but I asked around and it seems like no one I know ever had to do that when downloading a full season ... I don' know what to do/try anymore ..."
,hadarw,2005-07-31T14:34Z,"I downloaded the latest codec pack from http://www.codecpack.com/ and I used my VLC player and everything worked fine (both season 1 and 2) - also GSpot has no problem rendering the files.
As for kaptenkongo's question, I watched the 2nd and 3rd episodes of both seasons before I downloaded the complete seasons.
I'm sorry it doesn't work for you guys, but the encoding seems to be ok..."
,zonesch,2005-08-01T14:54Z,Third Season => http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3363908
,greet,2005-08-01T19:08Z,"zonesch - thank you for taking the time to put up those MD5 sums! I am now 100% sure it's the files and not my computer/player/codec. Which makes me more confused as I do not understand why the files are corrupted for me when they work fine for others! *puzzled*

Ooooh. s3! But I can't start downloading that one if I don't know what went wrong with the 2nd. 

Anyone got any suggestions?"
,greet,2005-08-03T19:19Z,jeremypj - where are you from? The Netherlands or Belgium? I wouldn't count on finding Dutch subtitles though! There never are Dutch ones around and it's already an older show + DVDs not out. Can you play the episodes? Do they work for you? 
,Hefosys,2005-08-08T20:57Z,thx
,jeremypj,2005-08-09T13:53Z,"Hi Greet, I'm from the Netherlands. The files are excellent. No problems with playing them. Only Ulead Movie Factory and Pinnacle can't handle the files. Thank you for the good work done!!!"
,greet,2005-08-10T19:55Z,"Jeremypj - would it be too much to ask for if you'd put the episodes on discs and send them to me? I'd pay for the dvds & stamps of course. Or send you blank DVDs. I'd just really, really like to watch more of Felicity. Mail me at justwantedto @ gmail.com if you'd want to help me out. Please? I'm from Belgium btw."
,ddeeper,2006-04-13T20:12Z,anybody please seed this.thanks.

,meltlet,2006-12-08T10:55Z,"Hey, first of all, thanks for this. I haven't download it yet, but am going to...

Just wondering if there was one for Season 1?"
,nomisweb,2007-02-06T20:28Z,"hey thanks for the download, any word on season 1 and 3? I cant find them anywhere..."
,bobbokrull2006,2007-03-23T20:38Z,Great upload!! Thx!!
