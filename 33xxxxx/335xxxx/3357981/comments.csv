normally i use a 301 CD changer in ""random"" mode so i listen on one track at a time. I also checked their first and second and i say that the vocals on these is not good enough to my taste 

I have the fourth album on CD and i'll put it up 
later today (must prioritize breakfast :-)

As an odd knowledge, the first two albums i bought in the ""rock"" genre was ""rock'nroll testament"" and scorpions ""fly to the rainbow""
both is top notch albums :-)

I'll go reprogram my changer til breakfast :-)"
