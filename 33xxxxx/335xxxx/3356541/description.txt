I`m a lazy sod so I grabbed this from Psychedelic-music.com:

Simla Beat is an India compilation set up by a "Tobacco company". They might had the idea to catch hippy-non-smokers with cool sounds. If you can imagine to join the Yardbirds or early Velvet Underground in their homestudios you might get an idea how this records sounds like. Great all-english vocals, fuzz-guitars and organ. Totally stoned and rough. We personally think those bands are actually from US. There is not a single sitar/tabla or other India influence music on it. Instead: ROUGH GARAGE-SOUND and FUZZED-OUT MAYHEM. Originals are rare as golddust. This Double LP was released as 2 single albums. Voted from many dealers and collectors as the BEST RE-ISSUE EVER.

Its all cool music and its a genre I dig, so grab it while you can :D
