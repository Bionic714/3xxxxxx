,nathanroche,2005-08-12T21:45Z,Does anyone have English subtitles for this film? The only ones I keep finding are for the 2 CD download file.
,rhum_guardian,2006-08-21T15:56Z,"There are no legends in English or other major western language that fit this version. The vast majority are 23,795 FPS, and do not take into account the restoration credits that this version contains, at the beginning..
By the way the sound levels of the ""foley"" are way above the dialogue sounds.
This is a bad version of an outdated movie....
Tati was not french , he was Russian...

For Swedes only..."
