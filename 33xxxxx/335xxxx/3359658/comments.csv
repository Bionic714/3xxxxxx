,uXs,2007-10-08T16:00Z,"Flac's should be encouraged, they might be a bit bigger but then again you're able to listen to them without getting a massive headache."
,manmade2008,2007-10-11T02:20Z,"thx.. again, ppl... u can either choose to dl or not.. so stop whining (then again, there's freedom of speech, and u can choose to ignore, like I do).. continue to support lossless formats.. if u've got a proper highend setup, u'll get the idea why lossless format music is so appreciated by some ;) njoy life ppl.."
,angeloidus,2007-10-26T12:36Z,"Please seed more! :) This torrent is awesome, but no seeders :("
,NurEinTier,2007-12-21T06:46Z,thx
,superawesomecooldude,2008-02-22T07:05Z,awesome man! you freakin rule!
,ajtino1,2008-04-19T12:59Z,"Whats the point coding it in flac when the waveforms are over 2% clipped (I only checked Always Outnumber Never Outgunned, i didn't even bother to check the rest)? What a bunch of r-tards..."
,made07,2008-05-14T20:14Z,"@ajtino1: it doesn't have anything to do with how clipped it is. flac is lossless, thus you can restore the exact same content you had on the original cd without _further_ distortions. That's not possible with lossy (like mp3). It doesn't matter what the content is, lossless will always be better in quality then lossy*. I understand that you don't like the loudness war, but that has absolutely nothing to do with lossless versus lossy.

*there is an exception: digital silence. that can be coded losslessly by almost any lossy codec (but then again, bitrate shouldn't be larger coded by lossless codec than that of the one coded in a lossy codec).

big thanks fly out to the uploader! it's really though having to upload such an amount of data"
,Gr0v,2008-09-09T22:02Z,wow FLAC awesome thx! too bad nobody is seeding -.-
,cossa33,2009-06-05T12:35Z,Only FLAC !!! Thx so much. Music must be only HQ!!!

,khmakz,2009-12-27T21:54Z,"""Xfi Titanium + Z5500"" 

LOL

For HQ : Focal Grande Utopia EM  : 199284.3$ US (139 000?) you're Z5500 like shit :) its very bad quality"
,Isayama,2012-01-09T16:52Z,"Many thanks to the uploader, although the different albums seem to come from various rips (different drives used for the rips as shown in log files, two versions of lib_flac used)...
I haven't listened to them all yet, but Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned sounds fine to me.
Cheers for the sharing in FLAC format, music should always be available in the closest form to the original! ++"

MP3 IS SHIT !"
