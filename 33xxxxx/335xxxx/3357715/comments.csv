,Kismeth,2005-07-19T01:21Z,"WOW, that would be great :) I've d/l almost all of your games and I'm pretty impressed. Although i would like to d/l Max Payne 1 & 2, Prisoner of War and The Great Escape. If you've got some of them plz upload a torrent. :)"
,shady78,2005-07-19T15:19Z,sorry hitman cotracts that i was gonna up;oad today turned out to be bogus im gonna continue to search for it and other games people have requested though
,ribez,2005-07-19T19:49Z,"Well, how about a PAL release? This one is NTSC. "
,shady78,2005-07-19T21:09Z,change your game region in evox dash to auto this will automatically detect wether a game is pal or ntsc and let you play both at least it does for me 
,chronjohnson,2005-07-20T01:01Z,"Hitman: Contracts is up on XBox-sky, I believe.  Membership is easy to acquire and maintain, and seeders are plentiful."
,trasman,2005-07-21T12:00Z,ShadyRip? is it your own rip? what has ben ripped?
,Kismeth,2005-07-21T15:41Z,Nothing has been ripped. Works fine
,trasman,2005-07-21T15:46Z,If nothing has been ripped then why dose it say so?

,Woebin,2007-09-13T01:48Z,"Now that I've finished downloading I'll keep seeding  this as long as possible. I'll have to kill my computer from time to time though, so it's not 24/7, but still.

Also, thank you Shady78 for sharing."
