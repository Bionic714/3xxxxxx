,bibihest,2005-07-08T11:08Z,Ohh yeah thats a good excuse to play on a cracked server.. You could at least admit that you dont wanna buy the game for whatever reason you may have
,Häggman,2005-07-08T11:18Z,fuck you my game crached motherfucking asshole
,Karmacom,2005-07-08T11:42Z,"Bibihest, no, I'm not afraid to admit that if that was the case, I've bought only 2 PC games in my life, and BF2 is one of them. I bought two copies, my copy said ""CD Key allready in use"" and that was from a retail-store bought copy. I called EA support, who wouldnt give me a new one without confirming with the store and ""investigate"" how that could have happened.
The second copy I bought for my friend didn't get recignized in his DVD-rom, probarbly something to do with a sensitive hardware protection his DVD-rom couldn't handle. Anyhow,  I ended up returning the two copies, and used the mini-image instead. Now I play on unranked servers only.

The net is full of prejudgement, and you're doing your part well to follow that trend, that is your freedom of choice, but what you choose to believe or not doesn't mean it's true, nor any effective. But yes, If i hadn't bought it, I would have probarbly downloaded the ISO image anyhow and played it just like I am now.

To Hëggman, this isnt for the gameclient, but to run as a standalone server, in its own directory. If you've copied this into the game-directory, then that's your own stupidity and problem, not mine. Read the information (or the torrent-name? ""standalone"" rings any bells? Look it up in a dictionary.)

If your game crashes after patching your CLIENT to V1.01 with the official client-upgrade (which is not in this package) then you can go tell EA to fuck themselves instead, since alot of people have had problems with the 1.01 clientpatch released, people with retail-copies of the game. Or better yet, go fuck yourself instead, don't bother people you don't know with offerings of your sexual services like that."

,pokersucs,2005-07-09T04:37Z,"Its funny how quickly people slam on people who run cracked servers but wouldn't hesitate to run cracked games, software.  You wouldn't be here otherwise.  I've been reading allot of posts about people not able to run their retail ""purchased"" BF2.  Similar to the HL2 epidemic.    So what about the 13.4 MB game patch bf2patch_v_101 (non-server). Should this be applied before bf2_w32ded.exe  "

IF you use the new 1.1 servercrack bf2_w32ded.exe on s gameinstallation that has been installed with standalone server, then Yes, patch the game to V1.01 first, then copy that in there (if you want to run a server, if that's what you meant, if not, you dont need the bf2_w32ded.exe to play on cracked servers or to play, just needed to run a server.).

Allthough, Im not 100% sure just patching the gameclient to 1.01 would work with then copying bf2_w32ded.exe in there, making that a V1.1 server.

Thats why I released this package, which works independant of where/if the game is installed, and works by just unzipping it to a new fresh dir of choice, then just run bf2_w32ded.exe."
