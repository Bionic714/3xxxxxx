,Filibom,2005-07-19T13:42Z,"A very sentimental & thus violent interpretation of the ongoing conflict in the middle-east.
The suffering palestinian people are portrayed as braindead killing machines & even Sharon(the butcher of Sabra & Shatila) is in these people´s eyes part of the leftwing conspiracy.
Sick propaganda & no part of the solution."
,dsacxz,2005-07-19T16:18Z,"Filibom, I guess you live somewhere not in Israel because you possess a thought that is typical to that of the media like BBC and CNN.
Obviousely you dont really know nothing about Sharon except the well known ""massacre"" which he didnt take any hand, but just let it happen. he didnt shoot at unarmed women or something like that, he just didnt take responsibility for his acts. now, today he is a changed man, and I can tell you that I, for instance, think that we should eveacuate some 1000 jews who are surrounded by 2 milion palestinians in Gush Katif in Gaza. because as it is, it's just ridiciulus and a change has to be done. so, ok, i didnt watch the film, but i'm trully happy as an Israeli to see some of our propaganda work it's way abroad."
,dsacxz,2005-07-19T23:03Z,"Dear Filibom! hey, I agree with you, the situation sucks pretty bad, and I doubt it if we'll ever have any kind of peace. but you surely cant blame the Israelis alone for the situation, I think its almost the whole world's fault for not intervieing with the UN. but it's ok, I know that it's because we're jews and Israel doesn't own any oil so we don't count (unlike Iraq, for ex.)
I think we've lost all hope for peace but ""never say never"" :)."
,Filibom,2005-07-20T00:53Z,"You´re surely right there,dsacxz, the whole world have to act. 
Guess we don´t have that moral strengh yet to overcome the negative forces of ego, private interests (money) & idleness.
Best wishes!"
,hummiz,2005-07-20T02:07Z,"dear filibom,
I have to mention,that maybe israelis dont necessarily have a clear and an objective opinion in the situation in one hand,but in the other hand,they know exactly and even more stuff rather then others whom are hearing rumors from the media.
If u'll learn sometime about the media,or at least read some articles,u'd suprisingly (or not) will get to understand that the media's goals,is to gain something,it can be money,it can be political interests,it can be oil and can be any other more stuff,but media is not showing the whole picture,so maybe israelis cannot be totally clear and objective ,maybe the do ,but the buttom line is that they do have more knowledge about what's really going on in their territory,for example the Sabra & Shatila case.

Do you really konw what's the story of Sabra and Shatila ? there was a time,when Sharon was the operator there,but the massacre there was actually between muslims and christians (if im not mistaken) and NOT israelis and not jews at all. so because it was by Sharon's territory that means that he's fault becuase of his lack of interferene in the situation ?! common,this is really absurd and redicules and we both know it,its just like the was between Iran and Iraq 15 years ago,why won't you blam Kuwait for that or Saudi arabi for that ? its in the area either...
I can give you much more relevant example for the equation,but my point well understood I think. :P

by the way,the refugees in gaza,did you know that they're there because they actually were in Jorden and Egypt and other places,and this countries said to thouse people (in other words) - you are not good for our economy,we don't want you here,so they went from country to country,and everyone didnt want them,so they 
came to Israel to Gaza,and settle there with the Israeli government permission,after long time (few decades) they all the sudden
claim to the law that they were in Israel 100 years ago,and they want to come back...
so after many countries that didnt want them and only Israel gave them what they wanted,they realized that they can get more.
It's just like the case on the north border of Israel with Lebanon.
the Hisbalah attacked the north part of Israel,so Israel said - ok ok ok,you'll get a part of a land and u'll give us some peacefull living. so in their point of view - they won in the case ,and that only because of their attacks.
so now the same thing happens in the west-south area with the palestinian,they making bombing suicide and throwing Qassam rockets and other terroristic stuff,becuase they know they'll get what they want in the end.
that's really the case. the media dont give the real and whole picture of the situation.
England were kinda pro-palestinian,then after they attack they started understand israel,at least most of the people there.
People affraid to say - we hate arabs,becuase the day after Bin-Laden will send there an ""urgent visit"",so they dont publish there real opinion,they just shut up,or they say we luvvvv Arabs so they won't get attacked.

and im sorry that im regarding here to all arabs,I really dont have nothing against arabs,myslef have some arabs friends,and not all of them are evel,they really dont, but in the palestinian case its much much more complicated...
there're many good palestinian,but the Jihad,Chamas and other terrorists groups rule the whole palestinian area,and that's a shame.
Israel want peace and willing to do stuff,but they are not really serious...
remember - most politician says that they will do that and that,but mostly they just say it and do nothing.

all the best anyways :P"
,Filibom,2005-07-21T20:29Z,"Dear hummiz, I don´t want to argue but you are very badly informed.
Sharon was in charge at Sabra-Shatila when Israeli troops &  tanks surrounded the Camp(s)
letting noone out.
He stayed at a nearby hotel where he could overlook the whole operation from the roof.
He admitted a group of bloodhounds from the falangist militia into the camp & was fully informed of the whole operation.
And by the way Gaza is not a part of Israel, it´s occupied territory that Israel been ruling against the worldcommunitys will. The settlers building their settlements on occupied land is also against world treaties signed by Israel.
Truly sorry to have to wake you up so from such sweet dreams.
Best wishes"
