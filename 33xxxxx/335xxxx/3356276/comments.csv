,Glenruben,2006-02-06T07:36Z,"this is a really great comic! Will be on the lookout for the whole thing, too bad this is the 3 forst issues only... 

And why is the last issue really poorly drawn compared to the first two? that really annoyed me."

Oh, don't forget to read Grant Morrison's - The Filth!"
,the_blackhound,2008-03-01T00:49Z,"In the third volume, is anyone else experiencing that the 1-3 issue RARs contents are actually duplicates of the 10-12 RAR contents? I don't think this torrent actually contains the first 3 issues of vol 3. Anyone?"
,livingreality2012,2008-09-21T23:24Z,blackhound...no such problem...everything works fine....
,phony,2008-11-16T21:20Z,I love this shit. One of my favourite issues is the one with the royal butler who feeds the mirror demon and thinks that it's starting to like him :) 
,hemo77,2009-03-22T22:32Z,This is jpeg format and not .cbr as it should be.  It would have been nice had you mentioned that in the description so I would not have wasted my time on this one.

,hissil,2011-07-15T01:10Z,"Supporting material worth downloading:
(TPB won't let me paste proper URL links so you will have to copy and paste them yourself)

Check this album out, called The Invisible College - The Luxury Of Horns (1981). An obscure electronic album recorded on cassette in 1981. Very good and super rare. A good soundtrack to play when reading these comics. MEDIAFIR3 (put this after .com) /?czcla8i8cnqic8a

Also check out Grant Morrison's new documentary Talking With Gods M3GAUPLOAD (put this after .com) /?d=5JTL772G

Lastly, here is a pdf for the companion book written about these comics thepiratebay.org/torrent/4251409"
