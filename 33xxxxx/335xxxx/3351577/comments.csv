-all files needed in a folder
-keygen
-a .txt file with simple instructions on how to set up

This is an excellent torrent. I had Norton Anti-virus and AVG free and they were getting old and this is the best security program available and its free here."

,adam4192,2005-08-08T19:39Z,"bigboy_91, after you select that you would like to activate by phone, the program gives you a code at the top, this is called the phone challenge code. Copy it into the 'phone challenge code' in the keygen, at the bottom click on 'Generate code'. Copy/paste this into Norton, it should work."

,SwordOfWar,2006-01-02T23:39Z,"When You Use the keygen to install. You will be asked to provide a real serial key. Once it says that the key is invalid you must try again. After it says it a second time, Unplug your internet cord, and click try again, it will say it can't connect to server, then you tell it to activate by phone. Then it will give u an activation number, you put this in the keygen and tell it to make the new serial code, then you enter it, and its activated, then plug your internet cord back in, and Enjoy!"
