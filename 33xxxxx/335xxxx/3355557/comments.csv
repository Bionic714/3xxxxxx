,ak1968,2005-07-28T00:12Z,Extract the files with WinRar.
,HyiRewq,2005-08-13T20:27Z,"To use the tracker:

How can you create a torrent? I'd try with Bitcomet, Bitlord and Bittorrent.

I already downloaded the file but, I don't know what software did you use to split it?

Thanks."
,HyiRewq,2005-08-13T20:30Z,"Winrar doesn't work, only ask me to add a Winrar archive?"
,HyiRewq,2005-08-13T21:25Z,"Thanks, I got it. I replace: qtm-mdj5a, b and c;
I put it to be open by Winrar then I use Daemon Tools http://www.daemontools.cc/dtcc/portal/index.php Where I extracted my Bin file, I use to mount the image. Virtual Disk Partition machine you can view the files and copy & paste and then burn it. You can't with Clone Cd because the image said its 730 MB in Bin file after extraction,
with Daemon-Tools I could view the files like 650 MBs. 

Anyways, nice job everyone!"
,HyiRewq,2005-08-13T22:22Z,"I mismention something, Daemon-Tools can only view .CUE files at this rate time.
Just search for Convert Bin to ISO or just MagicISO the best I could found with little space of data."
