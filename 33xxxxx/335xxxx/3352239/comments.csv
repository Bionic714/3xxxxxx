,lajnux,2005-07-04T21:10Z,thanx alot. please upload the remaining discs asap :p
,Ritsch,2005-07-04T21:32Z,"Sorry, I can't upload all at once. We are talking about 10 hours and at least 20 gb total. The remaining discs aren't even finished yet. I have raw material for all discs but i need to cut and make menu, chapters etc. 

SVT (Swedish television) jumped between their two channels. I must cut and edit performances by Black Eyed Peas, Kayne West and The Who and this is quite a big job. 

I have 80 - 90 kb/s upload.

,andibi,2005-07-05T06:46Z," Okay all, let's just be a little patient. For my part, I got a fat download pipe over here and plan to seed this file until my share ratio is 20 to 1.

 A big thanks to Ritsch for going to the trouble of recording this stuff and then sharing it.

,Phawex,2005-07-05T08:40Z,"Can somebody upload this extracted:


Elton John/Pete Doherty (3)
Dido/Youssou N’Dour (3)

Couse i don't want to download all just for few videos... which format is?

Oh, btw. What about dvdrip with menus (divx 6)?"
,pringoo,2005-07-05T10:46Z,unbelievable the shit u r going threw to upload this respect RITSCH
,Ritsch,2005-07-05T11:41Z,"DVD is mpeg2 format. 

I made this dvd primarily for me to watch. But maybe other people want the whole show without cutting....

If you're not In to swedish commentary or Live 8 messages, just press next chapter and get to the song immediately. 

I'm working on disc 2. Because of multiple (4)mpeg-files (swedish television jumped between their two channels), menu Is little bit different in disc 2. I know that files can be merged but In this case not working the way I want. It's a issue with Nero Vision Express (DVD-making software).

And unfortunately a cut in Black Eyed Peas peformance in disc 2. But as I said, this Is swedish television way of broadcasting this show. I don't know how television in other countries made of this event. Did they broadcast in one channel for 10 hours?

If you want perfect cutting and menu etc, wait for retail DVD (november/december?).

,slayerx,2005-07-06T23:16Z,Is it possible for you to just share the Die Toten Hosen part? The other bands suck as but DTH rocks!
,marcush,2005-07-07T20:49Z,These torrent are really GREAT Ritsch! Keep on going!! It would be wonderful if you could seed all the concert! Can you burn the file to a DVD and then watch them on a DVD player and on the computer without burning it?

[T],rabboy,2007-03-19T12:08Z,Whats up with piratebay really? I don't understand why all ppl that's been dl this just hit n' run.. you can at least stay seeding for a while.. how in earth would a torrent tracker survive without seeders? Just check the info.. downloaded 3013 times.. and it's only one seeder? is that right? sure the torrent has been up running since 2005 but what the hell someone of the 3000 should be able to seed? Well Thank you ritsch for this awesome torrent! keep up good work!
