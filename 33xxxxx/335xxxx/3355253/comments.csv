,fienx,2005-07-12T10:50Z,FAKE!
,minstryofsnd,2005-07-12T10:54Z,"hehe, it's not a fake, i've read a few chapters into it.
Unless someone bothered to write 500pages and was a extremly good writer."
,VivaLaBam2,2005-07-12T10:57Z,"got eat a dick faggot, trying reading it before saying its fake, this is a proper scene rls to"
,Kalewynn,2005-07-12T11:07Z,"Actually I think this is not JK Rowling's book, but rather a fanfic, extremely well written, but still a fanfic. And it wouldn't be so strange, I remember dowonloading a 500 page fanfic version of Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix, a few months before the book came out."
,Puki,2005-07-12T11:13Z,"It's a fanfic. Not a bad one, but it's not the original one and that makes it a FAKE. "
,minstryofsnd,2005-07-12T11:15Z,"It's real I had to double check for you all, I read the first page a random page to a 'friend' who has a hard copy, IT's REAL!"
,sjackson,2005-07-12T11:17Z,"It's a fanfic.  Here's a snippet from the end of it:

But please, donât forget, I am still in the planning phase for Book Seven, and I only have a basic plot and good ending written up for it that I think shall be almost exactly what J.K. Rowling is planning to have. Any extra things that you guys would like to see in it, or ideas you have that could make it better are very welcome. You can either e-mail me them, tell me in the forum, or tell me on AIM. See you online! -HarryWriter"
,Q-Tomp,2005-07-12T13:09Z,oh its fake
,makuz,2005-07-12T13:16Z,it's the fan fiction written by harrywriter.
,merlinus3000,2005-07-12T13:32Z,"It's really a fake, not worth downloading. It's the same i found on ed2k servers"
,Growf,2005-07-12T14:41Z,"I download this and IT'S FAKE!!!!
Someone did have the time to write 500 pages of fan-fiction.  J.K. Rowling would never start a book and dedicate several pages with Harry Potter's need to go to the bathroom. Sheesh!"
,biggles911,2005-07-12T14:54Z,"IT IS FAKE you morons, The writing style is wrong, the story makes no sense, anyone who thinks this is real is the worlds biggest fuck wit."
,svage2,2005-07-12T14:57Z,It is only to be out on 16th July... why bother downloading it now? Of course it is fake...
,splintereye,2005-07-12T15:33Z,haha how can people actually think that this is real?
,sucralose,2005-07-12T15:42Z,"I could tell within two paragraph's that this was not rowling. This person has grade 6 grammar and doesn't know the meaning of the word exposition..... ""just in case you didn't know, i'm going to tell you on the first page that harry potter's parents were killed by the evil wizard voldemort.""  Why try to pass off your shitty fan fiction as the real thing... do you think someone's going to say ""oooooh, even though i was expecting rowling, this is SOOOO much better! Let's give her a book deal!""..... idiot."
,TechDaddy123,2005-07-12T16:14Z,"It may be a fan fiction, but I just read that a supermarket in British Columbia accidentally sold 14 copies yesterday.  The real thing might still show up."
,denns,2005-07-12T17:21Z,"BUt it isnt a virus or a trojan or anything right?

soo I can still download it without geting any virus??"
,Catariina05,2005-07-12T21:37Z,"This is the same fake copy that has been around since january. Sorry folks, must wait!"
,KeanuReefa,2005-07-12T22:30Z,"  The REAL one is supposed to have these chapters:

    Chapter Two: ""Spinners End"" 
            Chapter Six: ""Draco's Detour"" 
                    Chapter Fourteen: ""Felix Felicis"" 

                                :-D"
,Shades6666,2005-07-13T00:58Z,"The dead giveaway that it's fake is the first line of the epilog:
Wow, two books down! One more to go!
"
,crazydiamond,2005-07-13T01:28Z,"I haven't downloaded this torrent, but based on what I've read in the comments I would say that this in actually ""Harry Potter and the Ring of the Ancients"" as written by ""Harry Writer"" over a year ago. I read this last June. There is a book 5 by this person as well that came out just before Order of the Phoenix (also called OotP).

If you want to read this fan fic, I would recomend trying to find his first book (order of the phoenix by Harry Writer, probably on kazaa or something) since they sort of go together.

Anyway, yes, this person spent a log of time on the fan fics and they're of high quality plot wise and worth a read, but they're terribly written if he/she wants to make them look like JKRs work. They're full of pop culture references and kids who speak hax0r."
,heneseeee,2005-07-13T05:39Z,itz fake u beezies.
,johnboy420,2005-07-14T17:27Z,"What a load of bollox, after readin the first paragraph it becomes painfully clear that this is a god damn dirty fake. Especially where it says ""Harry had set a personal record by chugging down fifty-three cans of soda"" , 'soda' is an American colloquiallism for soft drinks and 'chugging' is anothr american word. JKR is British and i doubt she would use those words. Whoever posted this torrent is a wanker and should be shot for trying to promote this 3rd rate piece of shit fan-fic"
,starwhite,2005-07-16T00:44Z,"I KNOW this piece of Ka Ka is fake..however, tonight the REAL book comes out..I'm sure I can find a copy then.  No Thanks to the stupid FUCKER who posted this worthless waste..."
,Mxyzptlk1,2005-07-16T03:14Z,Are there actually anyone who downloads this!!! Honestly... good luck! (Idiots)
,starwhite,2005-07-16T10:53Z,"Fuck off Mxyzptlk1, I Just got a damn copy tonight, of which I'll probably scan and upload for all the good folks that visit here..."
,mali_Samson,2005-07-16T12:57Z,Can someone plz upload the real one...I have ordered it to denmark but it's kinda late :(
,FoxMcWeezer,2005-07-16T13:12Z,"fake piece of shit, im going to shoot you."
