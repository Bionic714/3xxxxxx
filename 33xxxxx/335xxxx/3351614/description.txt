Keith Goes Painting is a fantastic Arcade Adventure game in which you must paint all the furniture in your Boss's house. You have to explore the giant house and solve tricky puzzles to complete your mission (else you get sacked!). The house is infested with strange and exotic beasties which Keith must splat his way past using his trusty paint gun. It's top fun and has lots of hidden secrets to discover :)
