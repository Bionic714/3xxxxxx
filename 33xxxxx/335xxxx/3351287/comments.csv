,kriss2005,2005-07-17T22:41Z,"guilty or not guilty , michael remains the ""King Of Pop"" !!"
,mrfitness,2005-07-19T00:57Z,I'v been downloading for a week. I'm on 86%. Please! Anyone. Help me get it.
,flygsvamp,2005-07-21T00:15Z,"Yeah, what difference does it make if he is guilty or not as long as he makes music people likes? Lets just all blank our minds from the image of Michael Jackson groping under some kids pyjamas. Nevermind some few childrens trauma, let's boogie on the dancefloor."
,vxcriss,2005-08-02T14:30Z,Man the guy has been found not guilty and there was a long and complex trial. So if a major court of justice from the United States found the man not guilty after listening to all acusations and details of the case why do you think your judgement as a person who has not listened to all that information would be better? We all people like to speak loudly and point fingers and judge others but we never look at ourselfes. Nomatter what he has or has not done Michael is the greatest pop artist of all times and that will never change.
,Fenzzy,2005-08-17T01:27Z,"I can't get any sound on this dvd either on the computer or the dvd player, any one know what to do to get sound on the computer? :/, really want this to work.

and for what's it worth i do belive Michael is innocence."

,Tamarind777,2008-03-04T16:13Z,This has no sound
,Tamarind777,2008-03-04T16:21Z,"I am not sure if folks are idiots or just plain ignorant. How could you propose to know that MJ is guilty when he was acquitted of ALL charges in a jury trial? Do you have additional information that the jury was not privy to? Are you God? I'd hate to see you (those who say he is guilty and belongs in jail) in a public office. You make decisions based on the fact that kids are supposed to be cute and cuddy wuddly and anyone who is even ACCUSED of hurting one deserves punishment. Get your head out ofyour butt. Some kids are demons too and they, too, deserve to be in jail or even not to exist at all. Read the papers or listen to the news. So, try going by some evidence and facts, not your emotions. Also, if you are ever called to serve on jury duty, please tell them that you can't, b/c you have absolutely NO objectivity whatsoever."
,SpiderGav,2008-03-26T17:06Z,"So what, this has now become a place to bash artists and view opinions instead of downloading and enjoying good content? fucking losers need to sort ur lives out. Torrent took too long to download, how can i seed if i cant get the whole thing?"
,capitan4,2009-01-18T00:14Z,"Está en ntsc o pal???
gracias"
,Tamarind777,2009-06-28T09:42Z,"I love the way you idiots say that he was guilty. He was tried by a jury of his peers and was acquitted on ALL charges. Remember, the jury had ALL available evidences to ponder while making their decisions and STILL acquitted. You, who say he was guilty, had NO evidence and conclude that he was guilty???? Don't you believe in the justice system? I know it's not perfect, but it's still better than the rest. With that said, go and take a class in critical thinking, it will do you good. Bunch of illogical idiots."
,Thaiboxer1980,2009-06-28T12:46Z,"
He was and will always be remembered as a superstar an a kiddie fiddler. Wonder if Garry Glitter will get the same loving send off?

oh well read this too lol Gary Glitter has filed a lawsuit on the heels of pop star Michael Jackson's death. The lawsuit contends that the contents of Jackson's Little Black Address Book has an equal amount of names contributed by Glitter over the years.

The book supposedly contains the names of over 7,000 young boys in the LA area and was only recently discovered by a maid working for Jackson. "
,meeranus,2009-07-03T19:29Z,PAL or NTSC?
,missywissy78,2009-07-05T00:47Z,"I totally agree with Tamarind777 & Isforza !!
MJ is/was 100% innocent !!
They wanted his money ! (and got it) CANT you Morons see that !
It's called blackmail in other countries !
Study some Psychology and Behavioural Studies and you will know that he is innocent ! 
((me and million other fans know he is innocent) !

If your child was the ""target"" of a phedofile would you just take the money and keep quiet or do the right thing for your child and bring the predator to justice ?! (bad/greedy parents and weird child)
And he was found innocent in the other ""court case"" ! (and NO you cant buy your way out of court cases... and if you think that you have seen to many movies and well you are quite stupid) 
MJ's was around 100000 and thounsands of children and none of them are/where complaining !! helloooo !
If you see the pics and videos with the children and MJ you see that they are pulling his arms and all want to be near him ! and for god sake ! look at his behaviour ! study him ! (he was not a phedofile/predator he is quite the contrary )
If he was so bad and all that with children why didnt people/parents keep their children away from him ??? helloooo! 
There was nothing ""wrong"" with him more than a he was a abused child and had a violent and hateful father ! that pushed him and his siblings to hard and at a very early age to go in to showbusiness at any cost !
He had Nooooooo childhood what so ever ! he was a Child/boy trapped in mans body !
He did not like how he looked because his so called father mentally abused him ..called him ugly etc .. as well as hiting him when ever he wanted too !

He was misunderstood ! and consider a freak ! (he knew that) but who is so called normal now days ?
Their were so many rumours and not 1% of them was true just misunderstandings or pure lies ! 
Be happy that he did not become a murderer or something after they way he was treated ! by his family and everyone around him !
All people like to speak loudly and point fingers and judge others but we never look at ourselfes. You people who think Michael is a criminal should join the MPAA. They prosecute criminals.
Clean up your shit and don´t worry about the others´.  (like MJ said look in the mirror ! what do you see ? Are YOU perfect? NO because nobody is )
Make the world a better place ! without all the hate and fighting and violence ! 
Michael is the best! R.I.P MJ !


If you wanna look up a REAL phedofile/predator/killer/devil 
look up the name : josef fritzl !
tons of proof and tons of evidences and a Real Guilty verdict ! 
"
,missywissy78,2009-07-05T01:32Z,"And haven't you heard the latest !
The boy (now young man) and his family that got money out of MJ has come forward and said that MJ did NOT do anything wrong or nasty to him !!
They boy claims that his father forced him to lie because they were Poor and he/they needed money ! so he forced his son to lie in court (wow what a father i'm jealous ...NOT)
The boy says that he didnt want to keep the lie going now that MJ is dead and that he wanted to get this of his chest !! OMG ! You wait till he is DEAD to tell the truth !!!! What a nasty and evil thing to do !
But the boy and his family have not thought about that they have comitted a crime .... Perjury! I hope the spawn of satan and his weird and cruel and greedy family go to jail for this ! its what they deserve after what they done !   "
,MVariable,2009-07-05T03:18Z,"A few days a go there was news that Jordy Chandler, the boy whom aledgedly MJ molested, had said that he lied in 1993! He admited to lying just a few days after Jackson passing! He actualy said that his family made him do it! They got paid 20 million dollars!

I'm just passing on the news..."
