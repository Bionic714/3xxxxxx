Y`all know the band and this is one of their best liveperformances ever imho. (Not just my opinion really, many fans and critics regard these recordings as the best Rolling Stones concert recordings ever).The quality of the sound is excellent, as you`d expect with a soundboard recording. 


The tour of Europe in fall 1973 showed the Rolling Stones in top form, particularly Taylor, who played extensive solos on songs like Midnight Rambler and You Can't Always Get What You Want in an exciting interplay with Richards on rhythm guitar. This live recording made in Brussels on 17 October 1973 was intended for an official release, but due to legal problems it appeared only on bootlegs (Nasty Music and Brussels Affair).
