Now I *do* know Jack, 6 April 2002

Author: craigjclark from Haddonfield, NJ


Chris Leavens' documentary takes as its subject Jack Nance, star of ""Eraserhead"" and supporting player in many of David Lynch's other films. Nance's story is told almost entirely through interviews with his family, friends and colleagues, interspersed with clips from many of his films (some of which are more well-known than others). What emerges is a portrait of a complicated man whose self-destructive tendencies sometimes outweighed his creative gifts. It's also frequently funny, as the interview subjects recount some of the more outlandish (but still plausible) stories of his life, right up to the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death.

""I Don't Know Jack"" is a fitting tribute to an underrated and under-appreciated actor. It is a must for all fans of David Lynch and Jack Nance"
