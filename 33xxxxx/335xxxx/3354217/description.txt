Plot: Crockett's meeting with an imprisoned drug dealer, Jesus Maroto, who hid $3 million before he was busted, leads to speculation that Sonny is on the take. The money belongs to Mario Fuentes, a drug kingpin whom Crockett hopes to meet through the help of Kevin Cates, a federal agent investigating Fuentes. While Cates and Crockett are meeting with the smuggler, Tubbs discovers that Cates was the one who busted Maroto. He surmises that Cates has the $3 million and is trying to pin the theft on Crockett.
