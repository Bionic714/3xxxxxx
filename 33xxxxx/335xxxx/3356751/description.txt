On August 27th, 2002, the New Japan Philharmonic performed 15 pieces from Super Smash Bros. Melee, live in Tokyo, Japan. Fortunately for fans of Smash Bros. and Nintendo music, Nintendo recorded the concert! The US release came in the form of a Nintendo Power "subscription bonus," bundled with the January 2003 issue.

The track listing goes as follows:

01 Planet Corneria [2:05]

Each piece is a spectacular orchestration of famous Nintendo music, each one unique  in execution with haunting instrumental effects. A must for any fan of Super Smash Bros. Melee, of classic Nintendo music, or of just classical music, and still something worth listening to even if you hate all of those!
