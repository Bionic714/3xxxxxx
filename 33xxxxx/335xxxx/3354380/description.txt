This was a landmark album when it arrived in 1978 combining classic early AC/DC stylings with the energy of punk and using some of the most aggressive slide guitar---which was totally unheard of at the time(it was sooooo early 70`s!). If AC/DC are the greatest blue-collar hard rock band of all time, then Rose Tattoo (also Australian, also managed by the Vanda and Young team) just may qualify as the world`s greatest blue-collar punk rock band. This is the 1998 Repertoire reissue  with 8 bonustracks.
