Like 1995's Dysfunctional, "Shadowlife" captures the reunited Dokken giving it plenty. The band sounds much tighter than ever before due to a year of touring and also the talents of producer Kelly Gray.George Lynch is the real star here,shining like a sparkling diamond but then again he doesn't need a full song to demonstrate his technical prowess and Don's vocal array sounds so much crisper on Shadowlife than on its formentioned predesessor.
