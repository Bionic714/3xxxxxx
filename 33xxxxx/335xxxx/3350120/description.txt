enjoy!

Still in Rome, Pauly arrives for work at Momo's pizza shop
only to be sent on a mafia mission to Palermo, Sicily, with
his cousin Luigi. They must deliver a backpack full of guns
, drugs and the missing front-teeth of Mafiosi don Calzone.
The ever-horny Luigi then decides to chase two sexy Italian
girls to Venice. During the chase, they lose the backpack
and have to go to the Leaning Tower of Pisa to find it.
During an incredibly scenic trek across Italy to Palermo,
Pauly and Luigi encounter sex, drugs, horny gay guys and
organized crime as they scooter their way across Italia.
