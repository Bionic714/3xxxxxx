Whats wrong???"
,ssain,2010-01-31T21:22Z,"This appears to be made for German version 1.1.0.0 of the game. 

My problem is, I got a purchased legal copy of the game, but can't get it to launch in Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit. I think the problem lies with the starforce protection, because at startup I get an error message saying this program can only be run in windows 95/98/ME/2000/XP/2003 server. This happens during disk check, and running it in XP compatibility mode ain't helping. Tried installing XP mode to run a virtual windows XP, but apparently my hardware doesn't support that. 

So once again paying customers are being screwed over. Pff, just had to vent my frustration somewhere. "
