Great exercise in surrealism!

This is a very unusual  film, where the director Luis Bunuel plays intriguing games with one's notions of normal convention and fantasy.  As the film progresses and the viewer is persuaded to accept increasingly unlikely events as reality, the distinction between fantasy and reality is ultimately merged.  In the end the viewer is forced to ask a disturbing question.   Can those awful sado-masochistic dreams of Severine's be real events...?
