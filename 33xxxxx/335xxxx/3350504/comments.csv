,forgotten_qt,2005-06-30T14:01Z,"Downloads will be a bit slow since I'm still uploading Paris by Night, and also got stuck as being the only seed left for some other stuff..."
,forgotten_qt,2005-06-30T14:04Z,"Oh, and do you people prefer original high quality (7GB per DVD) or compressed? I like to go for high quality, but if majority vote leans for a smaller download size (compressed) then I'm fine with that. Just means more room on my harddrive."
,nigashorty,2005-06-30T21:26Z,omg...15 gigs....too much for my dl's u should have split up the dvd's
,9cachon,2005-07-01T04:32Z,"AWESOME!!! Another one from forgotten_qt. Thanks a lot ! I also prefer uncompressed high quality version. The result is well worthed for all the troubles of extra downloading time and HD space.
I'll help seeding Paris by Night in a few minutes."
,Xterminater,2005-07-01T21:47Z,"forgotten, bor you can use cce with dvd rebuilder and do a 7 pass and you will be ok.  With this 7 pass, your quality will look like the original, u cannot tell ;)

The only downside to this is it takes about 12 hours or so to encoder per dvd :

However, if you prefer kinda ok, but blocky quality you can use DVD Shrink but make sure you enable Deep Analysis and choose Maxmimum Smoothness"
,forgotten_qt,2005-07-01T23:17Z,CloneDVD compression looks better to me than DVDShrink. Read about DVDrebuilder a bit and sounds nice. I'm going to expirement with RatDVD first though since it's free. Thanks for the suggestions everyone.
,vso4152,2005-07-06T00:35Z,"what is the difference between 'paris by night 77' and this DVD ?

is it same song and same singers ?"
,forgotten_qt,2005-07-06T00:41Z,Not really sure. I know Asia Entertainment is like a record label. Different singers and performances.
,vso4152,2005-07-06T01:12Z,i mean 'is this DVD the same concert as Paris night 77'
,nigashorty,2005-07-06T11:41Z,a whole different host company..people rather asia over pbn
,forgotten_qt,2005-07-07T00:14Z,this dvd is not the same concert as paris by night
,vso4152,2005-07-08T22:37Z,"thanks :)

i will dl this DVD...."
,forgotten_qt,2005-07-27T06:24Z,Alright. Atleast 5 people finished today and they all ran off. I'm stopping the upload until everyone else catches up. I know there's someone out there at 99.9%
,aVietGuy,2005-07-27T08:51Z,"ok, newbie here, someone show me how to seed and how to upload a torrent?  like, if i like to share my files, how to do that?"
,aVietGuy,2005-08-01T05:49Z,"forgotten_qt, AsianDVD club not taking anymore new users at this time.  Is it possible you can put VAN SON Little Saigon here?  It would be great if uncompressed as i like original quality.  Thanks."
,forgotten_qt,2005-08-01T21:50Z,"Vanson will be multitracker (piratebay and AsianDVD). Past leechers have requested that the discs be split into different torrents. I would like to put the original quality up, but 7Gbs per disc is pretty big and people aren't helping seed. I'm currently working on Vanson disc 1 with CCE at 9 passes (what everyone assumes is max quality). Would that be fine for you?"
,forgotten_qt,2005-08-02T14:40Z,What do you guys do with DVD9 quality (the 7 GB per disc DVDs)? I always asumed that the leechers would compress it with their choice of software. Are you  guys burning it to dual layer or watching it straight from the computer?
,aVietGuy,2005-08-03T04:15Z,I keep the original quality by splitting it up using Shrink.  Of course i loose all menus and other unimportant stuff.  I just do the main movie.
,aVietGuy,2005-08-03T04:18Z,I'm at 94% and DL has been to a halt.  Any reasons for this?  Just no seeders or others just ran away after they are done?  Help me out here guys.  thanks. 
,9cachon,2005-08-03T04:55Z,"Burned to DL. Still $$$$$ but I like high quality. aVietGuy, be patient dude. Just kidding, I know the feeling when you're getting so close to complete. I'm back to seed again. My modem went dead again in the afternoon while I'm at work. Not sure if the hot weather has anything to do with it. Hang in there, no pain no gain.... He He He"
,aVietGuy,2005-08-04T02:18Z,"DL completed.  Excellent quality, just how i like it.  Thanks forgotten.

I will be offline to work on the DVDs, once completed, i will go back on to seed.  I appreciate all for sharing.  "
