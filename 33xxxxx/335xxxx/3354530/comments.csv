,Bluesoul,2005-07-10T19:32Z,"Excellent! Such documentaries are badly needed in the light of pro-Sharonist agitprop pieces flooding the net. And ignore the iMDB rating, people rate it based on their nationality not the quality of the documentary itself..."
,nikko1,2005-07-10T19:51Z,how ironic of you in using the term agitprop regarding something other than this movie.
,Bluesoul,2005-07-10T19:56Z,whatever dude...
,Ponde,2005-07-11T00:28Z,I wil seed again tomorrow. Im closing down for the night...

,w000ter,2005-07-11T22:41Z,"to to quote sailorbob from the previous posting of this trash...
Wow, this ""documentary"" is basically one long lie. The guy who made it was sued for libel in court by the families of the 23 Israeli soldiers killed in Jenin during the battle. He was found guilty and ordered to pay compensation to the families. Many of the lies in this movie are documented in a film called ""The Road to Jenin"". You can also find info at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jenin_2002


the tactics of palestinian propagandists reak of those of creationists and goebels.  keep repeating the refuted falsehoods until they stick.  hoping to prey on the ignorant.  it doesn't matter if they are lies, it doesn't matter if even you know they are lies, its all for the cause and anything for the cause is good.  and why choose to push a lie? because that is your only choice when truth is not on your side. exactly like the creationists."
,Ponde,2005-07-12T18:00Z,Find a political forum! And please rate the torrent for its technical quality and NOT for how it corresponds with your political views (like they do it on imdb)!! *sigh*
