,MickDagger,2005-07-12T08:45Z,"Normally, that means your torrent is corrupted.  The #1 cause for this is that some file has changed AFTER you created the .torrent file.  And usually, the file which changed is the text/nfo/description file... such as you saved it after creating the torrent and then that, in turn, corrupts the torrent.  "
