Eastern music and musings from the US acid soaked solo artist. Recorded as the soundtrack to a mystical hippy play (much like The Incredible String band's U) this rare 1971 album is a more spiritual piece of work but most of the elements from his first album are still present. Filled with Eastern instruments, psychedelic mystical texts and evocative Turkish Delights .
