DROWNED IN BLOOD - THE WARFARE CONTINUES
AMERICAN LINE PRODUCTIONS (7 song CD)

Hailing from the pits of Mexico comes this highly intense Death Metal band called DROWNED IN BLOOD. These guys play old school brutal Death Metal with tons of new school Grindcore tossed in. The music is very tight, aggressive & pounding away. There is a ton of raw intensity pouring out of this band. The vocals are done in a low end Death growl mixed with a mid ranged groggy & throaty Death growl. These guys are very good & are highly recommended to anyone who enjoys extremely good Brutal Death!!
