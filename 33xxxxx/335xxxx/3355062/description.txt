Sawai Miyuu is best known as the live action actress of Tsukino Usagi (Sailor Moon) on "Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon." This is Sawai Miyuu's 4th Idol DVD entitled "South Wind."

This DVD was released shortly after PGSM officially ended. The presentation was shot in Guam. Just like any other Idol DVD out there, modeling of various outfits is involved but Miyuu continues to entertain the audience by having plenty of fun in her surroundings by being herself.

Some highlights of the DVD:

1) Miyuu gets to be herself more than in her 3rd Idol DVD. Usagi anyone?
2) Cowgirl Miyuu rides a horse.
3) Do you like supermarket? Miyuu shops once more in a supermarket but this time, she eats the food while she's there!
4) Miyuu samples lots of different foods and is weary about trying out a particular chocolate coated candy.
5) A very beautiful and serene shot of Miyuu in the water while the sun slowly sets.
6) Miyuu's special message for her fans.

Behind the scenes footage was incorporated as part of the main segment and not used as omake. In the omake, Miyuu interacts with a stuffed animal. She takes her kawaii-ness to the max.

Miyuu is very down-to-earth and appreciates every fan. She provides a special message just for you at the ending credits of the presentation. Don't miss it.
