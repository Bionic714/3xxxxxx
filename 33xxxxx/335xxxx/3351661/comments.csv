,Nite Dawg,2005-07-08T06:34Z,"I've been looking for a combat flight sim to for a while now, and this looks like something I've been looking for. Awesome! I'll download it right away and hopefully play all day tomorrow :D"
,festis91,2005-07-09T14:44Z,Its very small for a simulator. Does it work correct?
,samhain959,2005-07-10T03:01Z,"Yes, this might be the end-all be-all for combat flight sims.  Games like this come along maybe once every 5-7 years.  Also, truly consider buying this.  The development team that made this game consists of an international community of modders from the original Falcon 4.0."
,Nite Dawg,2005-07-10T06:49Z,It works GREAT! I've spent the last days learning how to fly the F-16... man... there is alot to learn before you can enter combat. Luckily the 700+ page manual is included as a PDF!
,Nite Dawg,2005-07-13T20:07Z,"Just wanted to say that you can play this game on multiplayer over the internet with no problems. No master server that need to verify your game, no serial code, no nothing. Just find a server, connect and play."

,dougsterboy,2005-08-08T00:22Z,"Anyone having trouble burning this? I've used Nero and Alcohol 120% and both have failed to burn successfully. I unpacked it twice in case there had been an error at that stage, and I've downloaded it from another source in case it was a downloading error. If anyone can help I'd appreciate it. Cheers."
,nervi,2005-08-08T18:38Z,"ok this is what i did.. i opened the file ""mir-f4af.rar"" using ZipGenius 6 (freeware) and it didn't ask for any password.. it will then extract 2 files: ""mir-f4af.bin"" & ""mir-f4af.cue"".. i burned the 'mir-f4af.bin' file in alcohol 120 and is now wonderfully installing.. (still keeping my fingers crossed)."
,dougsterboy,2005-08-08T19:10Z,"Well that's the theory, I agree. Not working for me though. Cheers anyway."

,Avi_H,2006-01-15T22:23Z,"best combat sim ever! people say it competes with LOMAC, well it OWNS LOMAC! depends on what u look for, this thing is simply like flying a real F-16, the system's realisem is amazing... what is lomac compare to this.... Lomac is just a plain arcade game!
Falcon is a SIMULATOR, a one that is trully deserve the tittle ""SIMULATOR"", give it a shot, also take note, this sim is for the hardcore simmers, its the F-16 1:1, from the smallest switch to the whole flight model, enjoy it!"
,FlankerBoy,2006-02-13T07:44Z,"Is it possible for anyone to upload the original Falcon 4.0? Pretty Please???

,LiLBoY21,2008-03-23T20:55Z,"Honestly, not worth the download. Was fast, but game is just horrrrrrible. Compatibility with joystick sucks. Cannot change options, like sensitivity and stuff... and just WAYYYYYYYYYYY TOOOOOO many controls on the keyboard. Gameplay is also horrible. Unlike FS2004/X a simple button gives u the option to change camera, flaps, trims, and u can change joystick controls. Oh and also, graphics reallllyyyyyyyyyyyy blow.... ""revamped graphics engine"".... pure bitmap... Just total dissapointment... "

,tnt-06,2008-12-03T01:25Z,I seem to get the same problem as jezzez and fuziongfx   when i start the game the screen goes black and then only the sound appear.
,tnt-06,2008-12-03T19:18Z,"Known Problem:

Some older video cards may have problems running the new introduction video.
If Falcon 4.0 Allied Force fails to run, create a shortcut to FalconAF.exe 
using Windows Explorer.  Right click on the shortcut, select the 'Properties'
menu command and add ' -nomovie' to the end of the Target window.  Click on
the OK button to finish.  Now use the new shortcut to run Falcon 4.0 Allied 
Force."
,dan344655,2008-12-30T16:20Z,"Great torrent, works as directed.  Thanks

Does anyone the HiTiles_AF.exe pack?  Allied Force really could do with some better terrain textures."
,tezza2,2009-02-15T20:30Z,ah this game is cool had the proper cd version but cba to go out and buy it again anyone up for a multiplayer flight hit me up coz im finding it hard to find willing players
,xaros2658,2009-03-01T23:39Z,"Hi Guys the solution for above problem is.
Hope this would be helpful.
You might have installed a 3rd party video codec packages. They can cause all possible issues and problems. For example, the K-Lite video codec package is known to cause problems with Falcon 4.0 Allied Force. If you have this installed, do the following:
Open Klite Codec pack > Configuration > Fddshow > Video decoder configuration and change the MP42 format entry to disabled by clicking on libavcodec.
As a result the standard MS codec will play the AVI movies and FDDshow is not used for this type. Falcon will run fine with movies then."
,wolland1722,2009-03-11T18:31Z,"I had the same problem as jessez and fusiongfx did, but after following xarox2568's instructions, I fixed it! Do as he says, it will help you get rid of black screen. Thanks xarox2568, thanks Oakeey and thanks to all good people! Cheers!"

,Deputy276,2009-08-14T22:52Z,"Program worked great!!! Installed on DVD and then on my computer. No video problems whatsoever. For those griping about it being ""too difficult"", this is NOT a ""game"", it's a SIMULATION. It's SUPPOSED to be complex. It ain't for kiddies.

,ace_casper92,2009-11-29T22:16Z,"TO LiLBoY21: its not a game. its a simulator. and its not for those looking for a quick game. its for those who are looking for a challenge and who are willing to put some time and effort into it. 

Why dont you go play copter or ace combat? 
(no offense to ace combat. its a great game =] but it was a bit easy even on ace difficulty)"
