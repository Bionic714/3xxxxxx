      Just over five years ago, a military flight simulation took the PC games
     industry by storm. Falcon 4.0 was a game like no other and led to a 
     following like no other. Years of development produced an F-16 simulator
     with legendary features such as a truly dynamic campaign engine, 
     unrivalled depth of avionics and remarkable levels of artificial 
     intelligence.

     Quite simply, Falcon 4.0 was the most important game of its type in a 
     generation because it made gameplay intoxicating. This summer, 
     Lead Pursuit LLC, in association Graphsim Entertainment Inc., 
     brings the spirit of Falcon 4.0 back to life with a totally updated 
     simulator for 2005. Falcon 4.0: Allied Force pushes the boundaries once 
     again for today's demanding gaming enthusiast.
