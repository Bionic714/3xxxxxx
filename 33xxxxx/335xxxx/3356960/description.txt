Yet another stunt vid from Woody... It's my first SA vid, and it's called "Scream for me San Andreas". I feel my stunting has really improved even if my editing has not. :/ Sound synch is OK, though. The song is "Wreckage(indy cart)" by Entombed.
And guys&girls, please help me seed this one, for a copule of weeks at least! I can't seed while i'm on vacation. I hope to be back later with more vids. Keep on stunting, and upload your own videos! Variety is inspiration!
