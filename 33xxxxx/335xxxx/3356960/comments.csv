,ingemansson,2005-07-23T14:02Z,OMFG why arent the weels runing? this is fejk!
,woody,2005-07-25T20:06Z,"Well, ingemansson you obviously know very little about this kind of video. Things that look wierd, like the exhaust flames on nitro kitted cars and, yes, non-moving wheels, depend on me using the REPLAY function in the game. Maybe if i had more ram it would look better. But nothing here is fake, i don't even know HOW to fake a stunt. and i use no mods, not even ""hot coffee""."
,ingemansson,2005-07-26T13:27Z,hehe okey then this is some realy wicked stuff! :D sorry for my litle outbreak hope you make some more cracy stuff like this....are you using fraps?
,woody,2005-07-27T20:15Z,"OK man. Yeah I'm using fraps and vegas video. Glad you liked it, although I'm aware it's not pro class. I try very hard to make original stunts though."
,woody,2005-08-07T21:45Z,"Alright, i'm back to seeding. Thanks a million to Silver for covering for me while i was away."

,woody,2005-08-16T18:27Z,"Ok... Slight misunderstanding here, Dwnlodin meniss. This is a stunt video made in the game, not the game itself. You might try http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3352494
That's the pc version with plenty of seeders. Good luck!"
