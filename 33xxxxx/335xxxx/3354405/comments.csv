,Mr_PSJ,2009-02-21T17:27Z,"Can anyone please reseed.
I have got 11-12 people struck at 98.3% with no extracting as all files are rar files which won't extract until all files have finished downloading.

It's really easy just copy all files to a location and start the torrent(download it from piratebay) and give download location to the path whre you copied files than the torrent engine will check it to 100% and if it's complete you can seed it again.
Please someone do it."
