NOTE: It is compressed with 7zip which is an open source file archiver which gives significantly better compression than zip and rar. The 7zip program is included incase you don't already have a program to extract it.


Counter-Strike Source has gotten in a bit of a mess with all the patches and problems like missing textures so i made this properly updated, fully working version. It will allow you to play CSS and HL2 DM on cracked servers or over a lan without Steam, Steam-Down, etc or any such program.

GCFScape 1.2.9 was used to extract the CFGs. Then, with a bit of merging of the files and folders, and borrowing some DLLs from the Emporio relese to get it to work. To play, all you have to do is unpack, then run launcher.exe or use the included shortcuts (the shortcuts will work if install the game to "C:GAMESCounter-Strike Source". You won't be able to join legit servers, but you can play on cracked servers or on LAN.

The game is as up to date as possible and will work with cracked servers and with people using emporio's CSS patched to update 17. So if you try and play on a server but you can't because the game is out of date, you need counter strike source updates 18 and higher; preferably by Emporio.
