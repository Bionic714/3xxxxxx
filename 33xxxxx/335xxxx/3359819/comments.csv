1 question, does anyone know if people with legit installs can play on the same servers that we can play on?  (The ones in our favourites?)  Or will they get steam banned if they connect to a cracked server?"
,JohnnySA,2005-08-14T18:57Z,"I'm noticing two problems after downloading this and applying the patch... During the assult map, looks as though some textures are off, showing a massive amount of purple (especially near the train tracks).

Also... no gameinfo.txt for Half Life 2?

I'm fairly certain I did all this right, cept I put it in a different directory. Changed all the links, so that shouldn't be an issue."
,Duck (1),2005-08-15T03:29Z,"rmg, legit players will be able to play on cracked servers no problems at all. Aslong as a the versions match it will work. JohnnySA, u must have done sumthing wrong. there should be no missing textures. Half-Life 2 isn't included. Its CS and HL2 deathmatch. IF ANYONE WANTS TO PLAY HL2, LET ME KNOW I CAN MAKE IT AVAILABLE IF ALOT OF PEOPLE WANT IT. IT WILL BE AN ADDON A FEW 100 MBs TO DOWNLOAD."
