While Motörhead's drummer Phil Taylor was recovering from a neck injury, the two bands (Motörhead and Girlschool) decided to collaborate under the monicker Headgirl. The result was this three-track EP. Each of the bands did a cover of each other's tracks (Motörhead chose "Emergency" and Girlschool did "Bomber"). Both bands duetted on a cover of Johnny Kidd & The Pirates' "Please Don't Touch". The EP reached Number 5 on the singles charts.
