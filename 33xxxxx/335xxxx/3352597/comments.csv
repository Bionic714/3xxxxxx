,MistaDisasta,2005-07-06T03:37Z,Does anyone know if this is a fake or not? Does anyone else miss the days when films were of good quality and were less than a gig. *sigh. SO MANY WASTED HOURS DOWNLOADING FAKES AND EACH ONE COUNTING TO MY DOWNLOAD LIMIT> DAMN AUSTRALIAN ISPs!!!
,Sybella,2005-07-07T23:36Z,"I know!! I've been stuck at 44.4% all day. And, this is the second time I've tried to download this. The first time, I got all of it (different torrent) and the second half didn't work. This is a bummer. 


Please seed...please!!! :) Thank you in advance! "
