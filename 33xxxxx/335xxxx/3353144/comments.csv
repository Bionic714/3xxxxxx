,unrest,2005-07-12T03:01Z,"This is great! I saw this film at a cinematheque and the copy they had was...well as average quality as this one. 
Thanks though, it's important that stuff like this gets around. 
Have you also got part 2 of the file?"
,abschaffen,2005-07-19T20:03Z,"Hmm. I have Debords movie as a .avi, but mine is 654 MB. What is the quality of this one?"
,kattracka,2006-01-11T13:46Z,Wonderfull! I have been looking for this movie for ages. Thank you for seeding this!
,squid697,2006-02-09T16:03Z,Likewise... searching after this for a while... now if someone will help seed you will have my eternal gratitude!

If you already got this file and want the complete version start the new torrent and direct your bt client to the folder containing the file and you are halfway there!"
