,xorb,2005-07-20T15:40Z,What happened to the real episode 11 ?
,LarrySDonald,2005-07-20T18:00Z,"Since showtime has now decided to air the ""real"" episode 10 (Signs from heaven) on July 25th, claiming that the whole non-airing was due to it's premiere date falling on July 4th (US independence day), I'm sure the confusion will continue to abound (hardly anyone gives this explanation much credence, but they have their own legal issues I assume and they're airing it so that's good). By the original numbering, E11 was Ghost Busters, which aired just fine and is circulating as usual. E10 (Signs from heaven) was also available on their On Demand service and hence made it onto the net as well. The reshuffle means that some will keep the original numbering (10 - Signs, 11 - Ghostbusters, 12 - Endangerd Species, 13 - The Best) while some will probably adopt the numbering now used on sho.com (10 - Ghost, 11 - Endangered, 12 - Signs, 13 - The Best) per order of official airing."
