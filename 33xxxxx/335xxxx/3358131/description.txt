Penn & Teller : Bullshit! s03e12 Endangered Species

Yes, this is episode 12, not 11 as it says on certain websites (nforce). Episode 10 was mistakenly aired on Showtime before all people interviewed had signed release forms, so they had to cancel that episode. It did, however, find it's way out on the internet.

This, however, is episode 12, about endangered species. Enjoy.
