,urmamma,2005-06-30T20:48Z,"Yeah, thats true.."
,Van_Gogh,2005-07-01T00:04Z,thanx! i'll give it a try ;)
,knark_hopp,2005-07-31T03:26Z,"I've used many music players, all have been either too buggy(WinAmp, Itunes WMP etc.) or suffering from a very limited or bad working playlist functions (VLC etc.), but foobar2000 combines stability with a great user interface that uses minimal resources. The only thing that is annoying me is that there is no volume regulator on the main window. The tab system, which allows you to have many playlists open at a time, is working extremely well."
