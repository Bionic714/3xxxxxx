OK. First of all you need the PTC Host ID. You'll get this by starting CD1. The ID Appears down in the left corner of the splashscreen.
Start the Cracker. Type the ID into the Field.
You'll now get a license file called ""license.dat"". Put it into a folder you want to. During the installation you'll have to chose options between a License Server or a License File. Chose the file and pick the one you createt. Everything should run now.
Peronal tip: Turn on your Firewall and don't let any PTC data out to the internet... ;-)

,thebc,2005-07-11T22:49Z,"thx, even if it is WF1.  this is likely the first time any version of Pro/E has ever been available for dl.  i'm glad they got away from NT-only versions.                          so what do we do witth the extracted files ?  just burn the 3 cd1 files on a cd, the same for cd2 and 3 ?  then use to install ?                        or maybe use DVDdecrypter in mode/iso/write  then select the img file, and burn ?  in which case, what is the importance of the ccd and subittle files ?                  thx for any help."

,the_shadow,2005-07-16T19:34Z,"Yes, it's Wildfire1. Couldn't get the Latest version.

CD1.CCD
CD1.IMG
CD1.SUB
Then it goes to CD2 and CD3 with the same extensions.
How do I install this?
Thanks so much for your help."
