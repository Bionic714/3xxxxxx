,drohr,2005-07-12T09:13Z,Sound out of sync. At least on the season 5 part. Sucks.
,LMFAO,2005-07-24T21:30Z,"Hopefully, there will be seeders left ?
I have seen that here at TPB they tend to disepear kinda fast.."
,osmanornitorenk,2005-08-02T21:27Z,"uhh, what do i need to view these? ive downloaded 5gbs but the torrent is showing 0.4%, and no file shows completed even though the filesize is complete. do i lack a codec (ihave divx adn xvid) or they arent playing because the torrent program is messed up (aka do i have to restart)"
,Balle_Clorin,2006-01-03T00:21Z,"uhh??? WTF happened with the rest of the comments? Last time I checked status of this torrent there where about 18 comments, now there's 10???? Not that it mathers that much, I just find it strange...."

,crazy_monkey,2006-05-15T07:16Z,hooray! audio on season 5 plays perfectly and in sync if you use realplayer but out of sync on VLC.  weird but true :)
,Nagi,2006-07-23T22:24Z,"Maybe it's just an error on my part, but I couldn't get the first episode in season three to play. But besides that, this is a great post and thanks for it."
,WCD_Thor,2006-08-07T01:04Z,"Just a general comment, people who get this downloaded, please seed, never enough seeders on TPB"

,DarkSuperMario,2006-09-21T01:31Z,"hey, what codec do i need to view this? it isnt letting me view it from realplayer :/"
,luffarungen,2006-09-23T21:01Z,"i guess it's in xvid (video)...and perhaps mp3 and/or ac3 (audio).

don't use realplayer as it isn't so good. instead use videolan (aka VLC)."

,LittleFang,2010-09-08T04:53Z,"Firstly, thank you very much for this upload, Balle_Clorin!

Secondly, re the supposed season 5 sync issues, I have downloaded and watched eps 1-13 of season 5 so far and the only episode that had the sound out of sync was the very first one - the rest have been fine. (I use VLC.) 

As far as I can tell, this is the only torrent that has episodes 13-17 of season 5 so, to anyone interested, I do recommend downloading them from here and not being put off by inaccurate comments!

So once again, thanks Balle_Clorin! Now if only more people would seed... :-)"

,neophius,2012-08-09T19:44Z,OMG Im seeding like a FOther Fucker here and always seed like a mental case and what do i get . the last 5 of my torrents that i downloaded failed coz some assholes don't keep seeding I always seed atleast 1 month after i have downbloaded and then re seed at the end of my month on all downloads. WTF. People SEED. Im not having a go at the regulars but some people seem like they always cut and run. Its fair that you atleast upload as much as you download if you have the capacity  to do so.Also does anyone know how i can make my NAS stay online While my system is off.((Impossible)) Or NOT.
