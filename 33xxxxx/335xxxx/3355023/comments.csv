A great piano player!!
Ever heard of Ferdinand Joseph La Menthe Morton?
Please be quiet with words like innovator.
But Thanks anyway!!    "

Having said that, though, I will VERY happily take what you have here on offer.  Thanks once again for all of your jazz uploads...don't stop!

P.S.  When you get a chance, can you toss up the discography info for the Nat King Cole set?  Hate to sound like a scratched CD, but...well, tracking down that release info on allmusic.com IS the proverbial needle-haystack task!"

Thanks, very much. We're reporting on the 1920's, and I could not find a download of the Charleston or ragtime music anywhere! Not to mention the fact that it's good music anyways. ^^

Great torrent."

Please seed! "

When I was young, I played some with the Louis Armstrong, Dorsey Band, Eddie Peabody, etc. Anyway, there was a piece Johnson used to play that some say was probably his finest work, set him apart from everyone. He called it ""Steeplechase Rag"". I don't know if it's lost now, but if you like Jimmy's work, and run across a recording of that, don't pass it up."
,Zeerover,2010-12-21T11:35Z,"That piece I was talking about above, ""Steeplechase Rag"" is in your collection as ""Over the Bars"".  Not exactly the way I remembered it, but definitely the same piece. Great. Thanks again."
