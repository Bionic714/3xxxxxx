,gadjet,2005-07-08T18:00Z,"Hi ventheman,
Great post...Are these cracked maps or do they only work with the cracked TomTom Navigator 5 .exe.
Thanks in advance.....:)"

,RedDevil210,2006-05-13T16:19Z,"Hi! I want to know if somebody of you has a crack or an activation code for the Italy plus? Or is there a crack which makes it possible that i never need an activation code?
Thanks!"
,puosu,2006-12-01T06:40Z,"Hi!

Installed TomTom 5.2 without maps. Succeeded to plant a map later to MMC:s /tomtom -folder.

If I want to install multiple maps, how this is done? Tried to install maps on /tomtom/nameofthemap/ and /tomtom/maps... no success.

Any info appreciated, Im using S60-telephone and card-reader."
