The Butterfly Effect
    * Michael Suby
    * The Czech Philharmonic Orchestra
    
    * 2004 

I know what you're thinking. "Michael Suby... who he and why?" - well, apparently he is an old friend of the directors and got the job based on a demo theme he wrote for The Butterfly Effect. In their liner note, directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber seem surprised that a pair of first time directors should be permitted to use a first time (almost) film composer, yet I suspect the producers were also counting the pennies. That the score is performed by the somewhat inexpensive (but excellent) Czech Philharmonic Orchestra does suggest a modest music budget. However, for all that, Michael Suby's music is often surprisingly good and even if he doesn't quite escape some of the current horror score clich√©s, then at least he does it without allowing it to degenerate into a musically inconsequential mess.
