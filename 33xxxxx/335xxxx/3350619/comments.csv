,fartenblat,2011-02-21T06:30Z,"Seeding is done by having the file on your HDD and being willing to let other people download it.   VTV and TV Team, are two great examples.  They capture episodes of TV shows, then they 'seed' them, other people download the file, and they also seed.  They are the seed that the great Oak that is BT grows from.  Or something."
