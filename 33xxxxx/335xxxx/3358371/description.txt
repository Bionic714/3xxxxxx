Release Notes:

When the dust settles, Joni Mitchell may stand as the 
most important and influential female recording artist 
of the late 20th century. Uncompromising and iconoclastic, 
 
 
Mitchell confounded expectations at every turn; restlessly 
innovative, her music evolved from deeply personal folk 
stylings into pop, jazz, avant-garde, and even world music, 
presaging the multicultural experimentation of the 1980s and 
1990s by over a decade.

Enjoy.
