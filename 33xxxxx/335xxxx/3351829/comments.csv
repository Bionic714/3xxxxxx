,kontrast_dk,2005-07-06T19:58Z,"w00ter: I'm glad for your concern about the problems of africa, though I don't know if you're helping anybody by saying how bad the Live 8 initiative is. It's really easy telling others how to do, but a tremendous act pulling this kind of thing of. Be glad instead - glad that also ""shallow"" people are starting to care."
,endless889,2005-07-06T20:06Z,i guess we're ok now with getting the full circulation going? everyone cool?
,endless889,2005-07-06T21:44Z,"right on bellamy, many thanx for helping to spread the live 8 sounds. new leechers, you can thank your seeders for the new luv...i'll my port open for a few more hours before i shut her down...floyd tour instore?;)"
