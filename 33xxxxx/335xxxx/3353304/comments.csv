,dinkfly96,2007-12-22T23:44Z,Anyone yet find out if this is PAL or NTSC - sort of important info for those of us running this in the USA on actual PSOnes.
,dinkfly96,2007-12-23T05:34Z,"It's NTSC, which is what I needed - thanks. It works in pSX emulator (http://psxemulator.gazaxian.com/) and on my real PSOne. Wtf is up with mdf? Do we need ANOTHER format? I converted to bin/cue with mdf2iso (Linux), but it wrote the cue file wrong. It had mode1 instead of mode2, in case anyone else tries this (cue file is just a text file and easy to edit)."

,805566,2008-06-12T05:26Z,"Piece of shit torrent.

The games work perfectly in an emulator, that much I can attest to. So if you play with the sound off, you'll never notice the difference.

The music in Spyro's all fucked up. It's either a PAL version or a PSP rip or something. Either way, it KILLS nostalgia.

Why not just keep Crash / Spyro separate?

There's a Crash collection ISO on eMule -- perfect!"
,thanks250,2008-11-26T02:28Z,can u burn them all on 1 CD-R? and is it a NTSC?
,squanto273443,2009-01-05T02:47Z,To use the psx emulator you must mess around with the plugins for any game. every game may not use the same plugins you have to try them out and see wat works... to find the right plugin just google it for any game.

,glnbijl,2010-02-05T23:18Z,do i need to burn this on a cd or dvd?
,nemanja15,2010-03-17T20:31Z,Ok my first time DL a PS game so I am clueless atm. What do I do with it? I would burn it but its too big (950MB can't fit on any CD). Or must I unpack it somehow befor burning?
