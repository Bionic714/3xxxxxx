,punishment,2005-07-28T11:45Z,THESE MP3's SKIP LIKE CRAZY.  ALL MIXED UP!!
,dpolsrod,2005-07-28T17:24Z,"I don't have any skips with the mp3s.
If anyone else has problems, let me know and I'll try to make a new torrent and reseed."
,Bantha77,2005-08-03T21:28Z,"How do I get the audible codec? Don't say join audible.com either, if I wanted to do that... I wouldn't be downloading here..."
,dpolsrod,2005-08-13T21:59Z,Get the Media Player Filter here: http://download.audible.com/webinstall/AudibleMediaPlayerFilter.exe and the AudibleManager here: http://download.audible.com/AM36/ActiveSetupRSDK.exe
,sean7,2008-02-15T04:05Z,"I've got the audible codec, but it wants a password for it. Does anyone know a way around this or the password for the book?"

Great content ruined by a crappy codec. Nice one..."

,insanitrax,2008-04-08T14:20Z,dpolsrod i need a password to activate the audible file
,dpolsrod,2008-08-29T00:24Z,"Hey, I bought the audio book legally on Audible and shared it here since it wasn't available anywhere else. If it doesn't work for you, demand a refund. ;)"
,polbel,2009-07-16T09:22Z,dpolsrod you are lying through your teeth when you say you share the audio book since without the password the file is useless waste of download bandwidth to the guys you say you share with you half-baked fetus-like moron
