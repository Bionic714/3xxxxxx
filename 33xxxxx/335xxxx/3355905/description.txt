    SKINS INCLUDED:

    Original Project Mayhem III skin from the CVS only.
    This keeps Releases Small & Clean and guarantees everything works perfectly.
    The only thing that´s changed is the look of the Webserver Interface.
    I replaced the Original with the Project Mayhem III Style Webserver Interface
    from KanadaKid (Scott). Looks very nice ´coz it perfectly fits the PM3 style.
    This also adds some small, but cool Functions to the Webserver Interface.

    You can get more Skins here:
    http://www.xbox-skins.net/forums/index.php?dlcategory=7
    http://www.allxboxskins.com/skins/index.php?app=XBMC&cat=0
    Make sure they are suited for XBMC 1.1.0 - They must be Skin Version 1.3 !

    SCRIPTS INCLUDED:

    FlexiBrowser / GameSaves / GameSpotPlus / GameTrailers / iFilmBrowser
    StupidVideos / QuickTimeBrowser (Movie Trailers) / simpleKML V2 (WebRadio)

    All Scripts suit the Project Mayhem III style.

    I modified the SkinProject Mayhem IIIPALDialogSubMenu.xml so that all
    of the Scripts appear in the Scripts Submenu. If you don´t like this, or
    some of the Scripts, you should edit this file to your personal preferences.
    The original file from CVS is also still present as DialogSubMenu.xml.ORG.

    CHANGELOG:

    To keep this .nfo shorter, I only list the topmost 3 lines here, so you can
    see what´s included here. You can view the official XBMC Changelog at  
    http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/xbmc/XBMC/Changelog.txt?view=markup
    You can also find it in docsChangelog.txt

    - 13-07-2005 fixed: Numeric dialog problems.
    - 13-07-2005 changed: RSS feeds are shown if video is playing.
    - 12-07-2005 fixed: more consistant use of default username/password on smb.
                 Now falls back to anonomous access should the default user/pass fail. 
                 authenticated username/password (as entered in auth dialog)
                 are now used for all functions over smb (exist, stat...)

    Some TIPS:

    If you are experiencing all kinda weird problems using an updated version
    of XBMC it is always a good idea to delete the XBMC´s SaveGame
    using the Micro$oft Dashboard. Alternatively you can just delete the
    E:TDATA face008 and E:UDATA face008 directories.
    This is especially important if you are updating from quite an old version.

    To avoid problems you should also check - with every new release - 
    if the included XboxMediaCenter.xml has been changed significantly.
    You should then update your own customized XboxMediaCenter.xml accordingly.

    Keep a tried and trusted XBMC Version handy, incase you need to go back ;-)
