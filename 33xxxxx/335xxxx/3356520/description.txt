Good heavy-progressive from England. As the title indicates, "First Base" was their debut. It's a quite varied album that ranges from aggressive hard-rock, to jazz-influenced material and to melodic symphonic progressive. Their sound is mostly dominated by guitar and some el-piano. Most of the vocals are sung by their female singer Jenny Haan. Bernie Marsden is on guitar, y`all know him from UFO and later Whitesnake.This album is great stuff for anyone into 70's hard-rocking progressive.
