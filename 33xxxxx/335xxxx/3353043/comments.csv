,Soyrico,2006-02-15T08:20Z,Does mastercam 9.0 work with XP?
,macroman,2006-02-16T23:12Z,"i have used other cam packages in the past but not mastercam thanks for the upload ill try it out.
just one question other cam packages that i have used, i have had to write the post files for variuos cnc machines, is there information in the help files for the post proccesser script?
thanks again for the upload."
,Gibbler,2006-03-11T06:42Z,For what i have heard MasterCam Should have about 350 different post proccessers for the different controlling systems and all the verisions of it. However you probably need to set the limitations of your machine since different machines can have the same controlling system. Works Great on my schools Fanuc system. Think it´s OT something. Also tried it on Heidenheeim 250 and it also works.
