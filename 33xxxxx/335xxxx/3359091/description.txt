"MilkShape 3D is a low-polygon modeler, which was initially designed for Half-Life. During the development, many file formats have been added.

MilkShape 3D has all basic operations like select, move, rotate, scale, extrude, turn edge, subdivide, just to mention a few. MilkShape 3D also allows low-level editing with the vertex and face tool. Primitives like spheres, boxes and cylinders are also available.

MilkShape 3D has also skeletal animation capabilities. This allows to export to morph target animation like the ones in the Quake model formats or to export to skeletal animations like Half-Life or Genesis3d.
