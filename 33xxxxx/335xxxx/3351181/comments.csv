,tycho467,2005-07-02T10:54Z,"sample, please?"
,Ranigun,2005-07-02T13:44Z,Great movie!
,zubastick,2005-07-02T13:46Z,"Good job! Image & sound quality are surprisingly good, considering that this comes from a CAM source. The size of video is rather small (384x288) but is quite watchable. This is MPEG-4 at it moderate best; opens with QuickTime & VLC."
,Donjon,2005-07-02T13:46Z,"Well, as it has been said, the quality is surprisingly good for a 440Mb rip. It's the whole movie, but it also strongly cropped. After aspect ratio is fixed the ratio turns out to be 3,5:3."
,SomeGuy1999,2005-07-02T14:53Z,"well, I did download this, and it's pretty good, the picture is not the best, but heyyy, it's good, watchable and free, and most important of all, it's here, the codec mentioned in an eralier message works, and despite the amazing small size, it's the complete movie, considering the picture quality, this codec is amazing. Thanx a lot Zipper, a fine release"
,maveric1337,2005-07-02T15:30Z,"Yes it's free, until you get a letter from your ISP. 

(swede's be aware) of the mighty APB !!!"
,Bwii,2005-07-02T16:23Z,Yes! We sure fear APB! ;O ---- http://www.antipiratbyran.se/
,lullz0r,2005-07-02T16:40Z,storleken och Mp4-formatet tyder väl på att nån har rippat eller konverterat den för att gå att titta på en PSP?
,snogger,2005-07-02T18:09Z,"Thanks for the up, but I strongly recommend to wait for a better one.

The audio quality is shit, and was way out of sync after around 45 minutes.
Video is ok, your typical washed out, too dark cam.

I tried it with VLC, Windows media 10, and with the codec recommended, and still the same results.

,ubisuck,2005-07-02T18:32Z,"Sounds (lips) is out of phase sometimes. Missing last 20-30 seconds of Morgan Freeman's speech when he explains why the aliens are dying of, at the end of the movie.

Not the best quality, but it's easy listening. Thx for the post."
,Daemon85,2005-07-02T20:03Z,"the size tells how good the quality is ... dont understand why you dont make it bigger so the quality is more plesent to the eyes and ears ^^

,manicmarauder,2005-07-04T10:30Z,works fine after some fucking about bit dark but mp4 compression fucks up quality when watched on a large tele highly pixelated
,Jaenq,2005-07-04T11:47Z,jag brukar spela upp mp4 filmer i quicktime men då kan man inte ha fullskärm... annars borde det fungera i vlc (video lan)
,atarilover,2005-07-04T12:24Z,"its pixelated because the way its been transfered , use firewire from camcorder you get no pixelisation!
anyway the movie is shit!
and mpeg4 does suck, do not download wait for a better copy or watch the 50's version or the one made in 95(?). better story,speilburg this is wasted money, time and energy! rather watch ET. ANY GOT IT FOR DOWNLOAD?

,BigViking,2005-07-04T12:57Z,"This torrent-file has a damaged announce URL (extra blanks in the announce URL) so it does not work in all BT clients. (For instance does not work in BitTornado.) If you experience such URL errors you have two options: Either tell your BT client the correct tracker URL: http://tracker.prq.to/announce
(Called ""external announce"" in BitTornado at-least. You find the button for it in the advanced window.) 

The second option is to instead download some other version of this torrent. The exact same 440 MB file but with correct tracker URL is available as http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3352025

For those of you with more bandwidth, faster CPU and more disk space the 1.4 GB ""showtime"" version is probably better, see http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3351453"
,SITH LORD,2005-07-04T13:33Z,this is too dark carnt see it
,<<Gouken>>,2005-07-04T17:57Z,ok for those of you who are new to mp4's you need all of the recent codec's in order to play this. And then vlc player can play it aswell as some others or you can watch it in Nero Showtime your going to need the mp4 plugins for it and you can also burn it with Nero aswell.
