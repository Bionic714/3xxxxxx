,kepler42,2010-04-22T08:11Z,"It is a rare piece, Thanks !
Nevertheless people should know that, if the audio is OK, the video looks miserable, even on a VERY small scree. No light, poor de-interlacing, i cant believe this carries Mr Scorcese's signature. Worth to have , but may be one day w'll find a better copy ??"
