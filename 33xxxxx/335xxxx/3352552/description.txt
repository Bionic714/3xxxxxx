The Final Season of OZ. I know everyone. It Hurts. Real bad. But thems the breaks. If anyone out there watches Law and Order: SVU that is where half the cast ended up. Keller plays a cop and Father Ray is the police shrink. They also seem to have a bit part for just about everyone. Check it out if you get the chance. I'm proud to have shared this, the best show ever, with my fellow pirates. Now I gotta go find me some tits. Later
