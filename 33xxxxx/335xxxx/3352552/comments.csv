,ScrewedUp,2006-05-16T23:33Z,Anyone knows where I can find Law and order: SVU season one and up?
,Fencliff,2006-09-21T17:04Z,"If you miss Oz, check out the HBO show The Wire as well. It features the actors who played Kenny ""Bricks"" Wrangler, Clayton Hughes, Desmond Mobay, the Italian building contractor guy from season four, and probably more that I've forgotten. 

The best HBO series since Oz and Sopranos, go download and enjoy."
