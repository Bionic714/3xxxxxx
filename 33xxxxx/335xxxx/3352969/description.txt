     DEMOS
Tracks 1 and 2 are from the "demos" cassette. Tracks 3-6 are of
the same era but in much better quality. These were sourced
from clean vinyl and processed to remove stray ticks and pops.
They have never appeared on CD and as such are a major find.

Track 3 is the same performance of "Monkey Island", but it was
truncated on the LP. The differing sound quality made it
impractical to splice them together, and so both can be found
here.


     KAZZ
Tracks 7 through 15 are the KAZZ show. These have been presented
previously by the Roky CD Club on "Reverberation In The Round"
but taken from a vinyl source. That tape was edited and the
songs out of sequence, although the processing may have been more
successful overall. (The vinyl boot may have come from cleaner
tapes, although none seem to be in circulation.) This new version
is intended to contrast the previous one, not to replace it. The
speed is correct, and digital artifacts kept to a bare minimum.

Half the enjoyment is in the DJ patter, most of which is missing
from "Reverberation In The Round". The announcer sounds as if he
had come of age in the swing band era. Presumably he despised the
garage rock scene but, consummate professional that he was, we
will never know for sure.



     SESSIONS
Much of tracks 16 through 27 overlap with the "Ortman tape" heard
on "High Baptismal Flow", and the quality is comparable to that.
However several songs on each are not found on the other. Since
this tape came directly from International Artists, it is worth
preserving in its entirety here.






     THE CASSETTE
With the exception of tracks #3 through #7, all of these were
recovered from reference cassettes found with a stash of
International Artists multitrack master tapes (as well as the
reel-to-reel deck upon which "Easter Everywhere" was recorded),
purchased at a garage sale in the Southwest in 2004.

The "demos" cassette features a white printed label, blank except
for "RCA Cassette Duplicating, 8206 Westpark Dr. Houston, Texas  
77063." One side contains the KAZZ-FM show, the other is demos
from January and April 1966, some of which were later used for
the so-called "Live" album. Applause was dubbed onto them, but
this tape contains the original mixes (albeit in mediocre
quality).

This CD marks the first time "Everybody Needs Somebody" has been
heard without the crowd overdubs, as well as the first time this
rendition of "Monkey Island" has been presented in its entirety.



Titles on the demo side of the cassette are as follows: 

1)You Can't Hurt Me Anymore
2)I'm Gonna Love You Too
3)Everybody Needs Somebody
4)Monkey Island
5)Roller Coaster
6)Splash 1
7)Through The Rhythm
8)You've Got To Take That Girl
9)Fire Engine
10)Miss Me
11)Tried To Hide

Except for #3, 4, 5, 7 and 9, all of these can be found in
better quality on "High Baptismal Flow" and "Psychedelic Sounds
Alternate Mix".

#3-4 were used on this disc. The other tracks can be found
on "Fire In My Bones". (Since that album has been rendered
permanently out of print, they can be heard here as well.)


It is believed that this is one of a small set of reference
cassettes that International Artists would have dubbed for the
band members to take home. (More likely the KAZZ side had been
blank originally, but this is believed to be a low-gen copy,
possibly 1st gen.)

The quality is what one could expect from such sources. Cassette
was low-end audio in the mid-1960s, and the tapes had not been
lovingly preserved. However, the material has been restored as
much as possible, and is quite listenable for what it is. There
may or may not be better source tapes in existence.

Until such are released, these will serve to plug most of the few
remaining holes in the 13th Floor Elevators' ongoing discography.








This CD is NOT available commercially.
This music is NOT for sale.
Neither is anything else from the IA stash.
Neither are the fans who make it available to you.

We do, however, anticipate a day when The Roky Erickson "Trust"
will be up for bids on eBay.
