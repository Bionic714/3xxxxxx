snatched away from this life at such an early age.""

i didnt know this man so i cant tell for sure, but if im correct this was probably one of em loons driving and killing people for there fuckin enjoyment on our streets. Also i doubt that this car accident was a single, a whole family was probably fucked up, bitch"
