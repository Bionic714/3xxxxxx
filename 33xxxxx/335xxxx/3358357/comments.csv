,darkookrad,2005-07-28T06:15Z,so how do you play this file?
,cheetohman,2005-07-28T06:33Z,"To Darkrookrad:  I used Nero to burn the ISO to a dvd, and it plays perfectly on my dvd player.  If you're using Windows XP, you may need to use the burn UDF DVD function inside Nero."
,Tisha,2005-07-28T09:30Z,Thanks a lot! Great DVD!
,pyp,2005-08-17T22:51Z,"Thanks, excellent video and music."
,fenderized,2006-11-11T19:57Z,I have perfect picture but no sound. Why? I run it in my computer.
,KBK-333,2007-06-12T19:19Z,"I,ve got the same problem as fenderized - lots of high quality movie, but no sound. The result is the same whether you use daemon tools or burn the iso using Nero. The audio folder is empty. Can anybody explain what to do?"
,KBK-333,2007-06-12T19:35Z,Trying once more to play the DVD this time on my DVD player is just pure joy - Thank you fantastic music and pictures as well. For some mysterious reason (codec mystery perhaps) I cannot play the DVD on my computer - well who cares!
,GrandadRufus,2007-07-07T14:20Z,Superb! Many Thanks.
