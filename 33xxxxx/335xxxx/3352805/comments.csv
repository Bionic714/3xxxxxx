,Angel-Neo,2005-07-07T01:36Z,"Flashpoint resistance, is the expansion pack the Operation Flashpoint Cold War Crisis, it is a fantastic game, and puts you in the plot as a ex-retired war vetern, who is called to help the citizens of Nogova, take back there land that the soviets, have took, the soviets are under the command of General Guba. First off you need the first game to play this, and secondly play the first game through as its very good! The multiplayer is fantastic, you can get game types like Deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag, Co-op, and there is even a RPG type mods called Crimecity,Nogville, and finally Cops and Robbers! My advice get these games, you wont be disappointed, i didnt upload this torrent, i just wrote this because people wanted information. Btw the Gamespy lobby is realyl empty for this game, you should you the built in one, and the final patch for resistance out so far is 1.96!"

The internet is FULL with it but my advise is buy the real thing as I did.
This year Operation Flashpoint 2 is comming out!"
