,Bonnis,2005-07-08T12:56Z,Is it possible to play online at all servers with this one?
,Karmacom,2005-07-08T17:08Z,"Bonnis, no this isnt for the gameclient, but for people who wants to run servers.

It will allow you (the player/client) to log on and play on servers using this patch regardless of you having a cd-key or not.

It's not possible to play on ranked servers, and possibly never will."

,Scarface0,2005-07-12T10:58Z,Why NOBODY make CRACKED server 1.01 ??? plz sombodi neare the baltc states :)
,Karmacom,2005-07-15T16:45Z,"Server 1.1 is used for client 1.01, just EA that uses different confusing none-matching version numbers between client->server.

In short: Server 1.1 goes with 1.01 client."
