Learn your shit first...before you speak."
,shirkan2005,2005-07-05T09:22Z,"The towers were constructed to withstand mutltiple hits of an 747. My major was physics and what happend to the towers did not happen due to an airplane or heat or fire or whatever. Those were about one of the strongest buildings anywhere on the planet. And steel doesnt even twitch at 800, get back to physics class"

Quit fighting over whether it was a conspiricy and realize that some selfish rag heads flew into those buildings with one goal in mind; ""Kill Inoccent People!"" Fuck their version of God, he isn't the same one most of us know about. Muhammad the profit was a piece of shit vagabond that couldn't even read or write, so how the hell was he suppose to be a great prophet that wrote this great koran. I shit on the koran and all you ass holes who think that 9/11 was conspiracy!"
,mattias_74,2005-08-03T17:08Z,"morseman21: Well... you don't know who flew into those buildings, you just accept what other ppl says... that's ignorance. Use your own mind, see for yourself."

Was Mohammad really a profit? I mean, did somebody sell something and earn one Mohammad or how does it work? Please let me know cause im totally in the dark here."
