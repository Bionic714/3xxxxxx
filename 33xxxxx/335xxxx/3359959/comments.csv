,d300mhz,2005-08-12T18:51Z,"The 'III' cover of Gin 'n Juice isn't actually Hank. Thank God, 'cause we all know Shelton wouldn't do something that lame. It sounds like Brad Paisley or Kenny Chesney or one of those faggot ass faggots.

,rmbell,2006-04-11T05:52Z,"i usually don't download huge archives like this, but i couldn't resist, great torrent post!"
,speaker83,2006-04-16T01:27Z,This is like finding gold for me! Like the genres and now I'll be able to listen to some new artists and try before I buy... nice one! Thanks.
,speaker83,2006-04-16T14:12Z,"Saw now that there are a large amount of doublets, and not very well organized. :) A tip would be to get a program like iTunes and have it automatically sort your albums inte subdirs under the band name. Whenever you remove/add an album it's automatically added to the correct dir and if you change the ID3 tag it will also move songs around... Don't know if its stable on Windows but on Macs, iTunes rocks... just a friendly advice when managing large amounts of music. :)"
,Ratbite,2006-04-28T17:26Z,"Vi vill gärna ha andra hälften!
We'd love to get the other half - please!

,Emilnaumanen,2006-10-08T14:11Z,Social and Supersuckers are pretty far away from psychobilly..
,Mi-Go,2006-11-05T10:38Z,"Half this shit is the same tracks just named incorrect. Much of this ain't psychobilly some surf, rock and punk there are even some crappy rockabilly in this but other than that its pretty good!"
,Nekrobilly,2006-12-04T08:26Z,"hey man, if you could post those 21 ghastly ones songs as their own torrent it would be greatly appreciated :-) if not no big deal. great collection you have here.I have most of it so I'm not Dling but you have a lot from some bands i've been after mixed in there."
,MegaWin,2006-12-04T23:06Z,kan nån vara så snäll och seeda så man kan få detta :)
,tikigrrrl,2007-04-11T04:29Z,"THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!! thank you so much for all of this..... i have some of it, but most was a nice addition to my psychobilly/rockabilly collection."

,Svante87,2008-03-04T08:06Z,"Please, please seed stuck on 77%
PlEase§1"
,Dragonpod,2008-06-03T18:43Z,"Nice collection, bro.  A lot of repeats.  Will be a good addition to my extensive psychobilly collection.  One question though, why is it separated into 7 rar'd parts that are exactly the same?  Would love to see the rest of your collection.  Wreck on!"
,jeffrey1256,2008-06-26T00:27Z,u have any P Paul Fenech albums please
,theponywars,2008-08-24T19:47Z,"hah i typed in ""Evil Zombie Cats From Beyond Hell"" and this was the only result.

,MasherX,2008-09-03T02:14Z,"Great collection..BUT WHO NAMES THE TRACKS....there are alot of double and it is a pain in the a$$ to rename almost every file..
in the future stick to this formt
artiest - album - track# - song title
there is nothiing more anoying than  
song title - bandname format"
,MasherX,2008-09-03T14:12Z,almost 1gig of the download is eather a doubled up file or a poor quality
,nite_angel666,2008-10-15T19:28Z,"Someone PLEASE seed... 

all I want is the Nekromantix.... 
but someone had to put all the bands together in different parts and I didn't know which one they were in... 
so if more people seed, the faster the download would be for me (before Halloween)....

please and thank you"
,kvntwvlf,2009-01-21T05:02Z,"This torrent sucks. It took over 10 hours to download, and then you have to take time to extract all the files, send them to your music player, and then guess what?

You realize there are up to 3 copies of some songs, hardly any of them are categorized properly, and there are not any full albums. Don't waste your time on this piece of shit. "
,FILMCITY,2009-02-02T18:28Z,"Ingenious ingenium!!!
This shit rocks the paint off my speakers!!!
Incredible collection....
Now to awake those damn neighbors!"
,ellenpea,2009-02-18T07:25Z,"Hey Ingenium, thanks for putting this together!  D-Bags bitch it's not exactly how they'd do it, but where's their torrent?  I have some, love getting new stuff (to me), and if I wanna organize it MY WAY, I'll get copies and do that.  Until I do that, I have a favor to ask - you said that this is about 1/2 ur collection.  Would you be willing to post the other half?  It's great stuff, and if people can't organize their dl's - Fuck'em! "
,indytruks138,2009-03-25T17:03Z,"did anyone else have the problem that all the rars are exactly the same, only got about 200 of the songs, don't like dl'ing 4 gigs to only get 200 songs.  What is the problem with this?"
,beeatch,2009-04-08T05:10Z,"Dont cry bitch! its psycho billy ,download and be happy that some one puts  the effort to put shit like this on the net ;) Thanks ingenium!"
,zwischenzug,2009-09-11T02:37Z,Thank you! Any chance for part 2? :D
,schmitty84,2009-10-12T01:57Z,"Beeatch.... Uh, you call this effort? It was more effort to rar everything than it was to label everything it seems. If you can't take 5 minutes to label shit then why bother in the first place? Axxo's movies were awesome when he was still here. Just because you don't have to pay for something doesn't mean it can't be good."
,Brunzwick,2009-10-25T11:29Z,"This post is completely unorganized, contains numerous duplicates, and has songs that don't even belong (i.e. it's complete shite)! 

Do you realize that you have Jimmy Buffet's ""Why Dont We Get Drunk and Screw"" labeled as Hank Williams Jr.?

How in the fuck do you get those two confused??

Seriously dude. Show a little pride and at least label the tracks correctly."
