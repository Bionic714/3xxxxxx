Super Hits of the 70's, Volume 23 is an excellent collection made up of some fun songs. The album opens with two instrumentals, the goofy "Hocus Pocus" by Focus that has some strangle yodeling on it and the super creepy "Tubular Bells" by Mike Oldfield which served as the theme for The Exorcist. The Kiki Dee Band's "I've Got The Music In Me" shows off Ms. Dee's impressive pipes, Blue Swede do a credible cover of The Association's "Never My Love", Pure Prairie League's "Amie" is one of the best country-rock songs of all-time, The Sweet's "Fox On The Run" is a great glam-rocker, John Travolta scored a top ten hit with his easy moving "Let Her In", Yvonne Elliman's pre-Saturday Night Fever "Love Me" is a nice surprise and Billy Ocean's first hit in America "Love Really Hurts Without You" doesn't really show the catchiness of 80's hits.
