,fanman93,2011-06-06T22:12Z,"If you are having trouble getting this to work on a 64-bit system, do the following:

1. Download and install VirtualBox or VirtualPC, depending on your preference

2. Download the floppy torrent of Windows 95 (search Windows 95 torrent)

3. Install in Virtualbox

4. Play away!"
,Dimmis80,2011-07-02T10:14Z,Hi guys.I can play the game under XP but i don't have music in the game.Some sound effects only.Can someone  help me with this problem.??
,barzefutz,2011-10-10T22:53Z,"This game is the Windows edition, but it will NOT run in Windows Vista 64 bit or Windows 7 64 bit, because they cannot run 16 bit applications. You'll have to use a virtual machine like VirtualBox, or alternatively use DosBOX with the DOS version of colonization."
