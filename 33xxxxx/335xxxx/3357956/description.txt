Mini Plot:

Creepshow:

Five tales of terror are presented in the gothic style of the old EC comics such as Tales From The Crypt and The Haunt of Fear. The first deals with a demented old man returning from the grave to get the Father's Day cake his murdering daughter never gave him. The second is about a not-too-bright farmer discovering a meteor that turns everything into plant-life. The third is about a vengeful husband burying his wife and her lover up to their necks on the beach. The fourth is about a creature that resides in a crate under the steps of a college. The final story is about an ultra-rich businessman who gets his comeuppance from cockroaches.

Creepshow 2:

The EC Comics return with three tales. The first, an Indian comes to life... to kill for revenge of his elderly owners. The second, four teens are stranded on a raft on a lake with a blob who is hungry. And the third a hit and run woman is terrorized by the hitchhiker she accidently killed... or did she really kill him?
