,Kelvin CHiLL,2006-05-21T00:55Z,"If you are getting insufician ram warnings, it may be that the memory it is warning you about is the sub 640k original DOS barrier.  Try creating a DOS boot disk with EMM386 there is a memory slot between E000 & EFFF that you can access with EMM386 if I get a chance I will look up some of the old config.sys and autoexe.bat files that give large amounts of base memory.  I would appreciate someone seeding this please?"
,Gasha,2006-08-18T22:40Z,Could anyone please seed? I really want these games...
,insane_goofball,2008-11-19T08:20Z,"Does anyone have the instruction books in digital form for these ?
I bought them all years ago when they came out... but over the years this that and the other things have fallen apart. and in order to play the games correctly, there are plot points in U7 and Serpent isle that you have to answer stuff out of the books.
otherwise you just teleport around, and never really play the game the way it was meant to be played."
