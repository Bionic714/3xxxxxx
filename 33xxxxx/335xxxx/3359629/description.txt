This is a replacement program for Windows Explorer. At first glance, it appears very similar to Explorer, which makes the program easy-to-use. Once you start using this, you'll find that the program is actually pretty powerful and can be customized to your liking.
You can view files and folders in various ways. View a single pane, double pane, or folder tree so you can browse files and folders in the most visually appealing way. You can also choose how icons are displayed, selecting from large or small icons, list and detail views. Or, choose to view file icons as thumbnails for browsing image files.
There is built-in ZIP file support and an FTP client. 
This is clearly a one-stop application covering at least four different programs. From installation to first run, you'll be convinced that this is a premiere application.
