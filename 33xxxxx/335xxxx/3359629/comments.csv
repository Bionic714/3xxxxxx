BUT is this a repost of the version that was circulated on the torrents a few months back, or a more recent one???
The program then refused any Kanji (Japanese ideogrammes), or Chinese characters, or Hangul, or even Cyrillic  (ASCii ....)
Newer versions do support them, but the patch proposed then did not allow upgrades, and thus the whole thing was useless for us living in Asia...  
How about this one????  THX  "
,eminenz,2005-07-22T22:18Z,"sounds great. thanks!
ps wabisabida - nice note! polite tone! what a pleasant surprise from what we usually see!"
,Dixon,2005-07-22T23:13Z,"The DOpusInstall.exe should be the ANSI version, while DOpusUnicodeInstall.exe is Unicode.
The later of the two should support Kanji and other 16bit character encoded languages.
Sadly this is not that file."
,Tomaszka,2005-07-23T09:58Z,I never seen crack for unicode version :(
