,tagfat,2005-07-04T17:28Z,"During a trial of the upload process my torrent client dropped a torrent file in the folder holding the clip. When i made the final torrent-file for upload that torrent file was included in the new torrent, and when i moved it from the folder it was reported missing from the torrent, hence the 99,9%. 
When I discovered that I was at 99,9 % i just pulled out. Nobody made coments about it for long so there was no way of checking if it meant something. When someone complained about getting stuck at 99,9 % i went for a new clean upload. 
Mostly the 99,9-problem is due to either DMZ option in router (deleting data which happens to be just like your ip-adress, something that will happen in a big torrentfile by chance) or to an invisible windows thumbs-file being included in the torrent but not read by the upload process. "
