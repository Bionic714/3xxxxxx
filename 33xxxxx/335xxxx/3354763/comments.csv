,Adramin,2005-07-11T13:17Z,"""Boofuckinghoo someone made a joke at my expense!"" Cuz it's not like you rip off at anyone ore anything whenever you feel like it. It just goes to show you can't take a punch without flinching, much less start bawling like a child. Real fucking mature."

.. NO TORRENTS FOR YOOU!"
,Maccie^,2005-07-12T20:52Z,"I had a bet in IRC if you would mentioned Seinfeld being jewish garbage :) .. i won!

You dont single out individuals, .. but spamming about how badly you got treated at CM's and spurting out 2 of my emails in your nonsensical bullshit rants is ok? 
Atleast give the correct story out if your gonna whine about it. (i know it's a older post, but i saw it just the other day)

If you got something to say then you know where to find us on irc."

,Scyphe,2005-07-13T01:53Z,"Lol, our little nazi-pet Sickboy pulls his head out of the sand to squirt some dirt... hahaha"
,Maccie^,2005-07-13T02:22Z,"Anyway, this is not the place to argue.. i'll let you get back to your random hating of everyone that in any way different from yourself. (Even tho i thought sharing movies was what this site was about).

And once again, if you got something to say to me or someone else from the CM team.. then you'll find us at Efnet. But i guess making up crap stories about us is more fun behind our backs :)"
,Maccie^,2005-07-13T13:18Z,"hahaha....
dude, seek HELP :)"
