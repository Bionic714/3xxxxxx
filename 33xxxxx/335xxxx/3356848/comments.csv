,otchie1,2005-07-31T02:24Z,nasty cam copy with muted sound and extra crisp packet noises. Camera wobbles all over the place and I wouldn't be surprised if people got up half way through. Unwatchable for all but the desperate.

,Nixtra,2005-08-02T08:33Z,its no good quality at all but the sound is good exept for de stearbing in the background!

,otchie1,2005-08-03T10:07Z,"That one is exactly the same as this one.
Must be less security holes in English film production than American eh?

ROTFLMAO"
,spirex,2005-08-06T04:40Z,"so what, its the same yeas, but it is ripped and released the way it should be, and one more thing, that one is about 500 mb less than this one. iseant that better?"
