PS - I saw a torrent on isohunt a few weeks ago that had 2 songs with Ville Valo and the 69 eyes, sadly it had no seeds, anybody know what those songs were? "

,diosadelosmuertos,2009-12-15T08:46Z,"ville valo plays backing vocals to the 69 eyes albums; wasting the dawn, blessed be, paris kills, and devils.
this is why songs like wasting the dawn or anyone from that album , they play together and too many songs you can hear ville clearly.

 excuse me my english.. i am spanish."
