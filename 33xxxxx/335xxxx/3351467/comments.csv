,straatMan_,2006-02-08T18:56Z,"Hey, i have a problem, when I use the crack that is following in the crack-folder, and paste the shit in the hardware-folder, the game starts. But when it starts, it says: ""Put in the Silent Hill 2 Directors Cut CD and press Enter, retry or Escape, quit.""

Can someone help me? You guys have paste the crack in the hardware-folder, and made the game work, but it dosent for me. Anything i should think about? Or something i have forgot? Please help.

,monokkeli,2008-06-15T16:14Z,"People, please seed as much as you can."
,bloody_shu,2008-07-08T00:58Z,"Crack works fine.  Install works fine when CD's burnt with PowerISO, as does starting a new game (when prompted for CD1).  Saves games fine.  

But, I had a problem with freezing up for no reason, so I disabled my temperature/motherboard monitoring program.  Didn't freeze up but didn't want to exit the game properly either.  I had to hit the Windows key to get back to desktop."
,jasonng88,2008-08-08T23:17Z,Run as administrator to save.
,powerthirst89,2008-11-01T17:57Z,"To all who are struggling; I'll give a crash course for dummies on this patch (no offense).  First, once the game is downloaded, extract all iso images with WinRar.  Next, use Daemon tools.  To use it, right-click on the image on the bottom-right hand corner of your screen, there is a little red lightning bolt symbol.  Select virtual CD/DVD-ROM, then mount image, then select the 1st image file.  Then, select autorun.exe (or something equivilant).  Game will ask question about leaving movies or images in disk, do not, select the 2nd option instead, run from hard drive.  Select the appropriate FILES (not images) when prompted to insert next disc.  After install, go into the no cd crack file, copy the sh2pc or sh2pc.exe file, then copy-paste it into the 1st cd folder (or whichever folder that has another sh2pc application).  I know its weird, but if you copy and replace it, it SHOULD work.  After this, you do not need to mount an image anymore,game works, bla bla bla.

Now, my turn for a question.  In apartment, James cannot use flashlight because everything goes black when he does.  It's a pain in the ass, can someone help me please?"
,dannypickle,2009-03-29T16:11Z,when I put in cd 2 for installation it says it can't locate data3.cab. Help please!
,imrankhan_mj,2009-06-14T22:29Z,"what a nut ?? why u dont tell us how it becomes black while using FLASH LIGHT....

WE ALL ARE WAI......TING.........."
,stefanydeolsen,2009-06-15T22:41Z,"the flashlight problem, anyone solved it yet? when u pick up the flashlight in the apartment everything exept me goes black. is it because of my graphic card? my computer is good enough and more to play this game. pretty important to have a working flashlight in this game. please help!!!"
,slippedwheat,2009-07-22T10:20Z,"the game works great 
saving works fine to its just a perfect upload "
,Kuisa,2009-08-06T00:29Z,"Open ""devices.fix"" in notepad and add line ""HACK DX_CONFIG_USE_VERTEX_SHADERS 0"" (without quotes, of course) after line ""VENDOR Intel 8086"". 

This should supposedly fix the flashlight bug."
,ricky_3817,2009-11-29T10:52Z,"got a problem, i installed the game with no problems, replaced the crack, but when i start the game it asks me to insert disc 1, whats goin on ? "
,ravisawalia,2010-02-22T21:49Z,"I've never been able to play Silent Hill 2 properly. The game runs all right and so on, there is only one little problem: whenever I turn on the flashlight, everything goes dark! I can't see anything except the game's main character (who is carrying the flashlight) with the flashlight on unless I'm outside or in another place with ambient light. Silent Hill 2 is such a game that it is impossible to play without the flashlight, because often you can't see anything"
,ravisawalia,2010-02-22T21:57Z,"@Kuisa
'where can i find devices.fix' ??????"
,ravisawalia,2010-02-22T22:34Z,"@Kuisa thank you bro i figured it out
 C//programfiles/konami/devices.fix (open devices.fix with notepad and add this line ""HACK DX_CONFIG_USE_VERTEX_SHADERS 0""  after this line ""VENDOR Intel 8086""

this will fix your falshlight error guys"
,NihilisticLaimuE,2011-04-18T06:09Z,"Thanks very much to the guy who uploaded this torrent

If there are still any people out there who had as much noob-ish trouble as I did installing the blasted thing, read on.
Although I haven't played past even getting to that first Lying Figure, I believe this game works well for what I did. With Virtual Clonedrive installed, mount ""Silent Hill 2 Directors Cut CD1"", and follow the prompts to start installation (Mind, install to Hard-drive, not disk). It'll ask for ""Silent Hill 2 Directors Cut CD2"" thereafter, and the third one after that. When it asks, mount the CD in question, and press ""continue"" or whatever. When it reaches the end, it'll ask you to insert disk one. Go to Local Disk > Program Files > Konami > Silent Hill 2, and copy everything in there to a safe location. Cancel the installation, and replace the files it has now deleted with the ones you just saved elsewhere.
Extract the files from the .rar's you got from the original torrent, and copy the file ""sh2pc"" that came out of the NO-CD one to Program Files > Konami > Silent Hill 2. It'll replace the one in there, and will be your launch point into the game itself.

A tad long winded there, but now you have an awesome game"
