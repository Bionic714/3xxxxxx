you dont need a serial on this one at all.  mine did fine without one.  so long as you have the cd on your drive you'll be ok.

the real question is:  does this really have all 60 volumes?  i have one like this and they only have 58.  no judges, nehemiah, nahum, habbakuk, and the rest of the ""minor"" prophets.  no acts, timothy, ot jude either.

this, however, is one of THE very best scholarly commentary that spans across denominations.
even with missing books, some of which i mentioned above, its still well worth the download time and effort.

i hope this helps.
