Release Notes:

Here is the proper release of Tori Amos, not taken from the web, Soulseek,
Kazaa or some other outpost for the "dregs" of the scene, like the
previous release. Didn't your mother tell you not to use Soulseek as your 
WHQ?

Also in VBR quality, as opposed to the ailing CBR of the "masqueraded" CDA
rip.
