,Cleocatra,2008-02-12T04:38Z,"This is John Williams the Guitarist's music? Or John Williams the composer?? Because John William's the Guitarist is famous for his Spanish Guitar music and I don't think John Williams the composer plays Spanish Guitar, but I could be wrong, please clarify.. Thanks"
,fsantosneto,2008-05-17T05:14Z,"There is a confusion here:
The music ""Spanish guitar music"" is played by John Williams guitarist but the ""Detailed Artist Info"" and the photo are of the composer of same name."
,albenizski,2008-10-14T09:14Z,"the person in that picture is john williams the composer, not the guitarist. good audio and working perfectly.. seed pls"
