,Vrannia,2009-08-04T22:52Z,"I've gotten this to install correctly, but when I open the game, the resolution is all screwed up. It's bigger than my screen. I've tried fiddling with the resolution settings on my computer, but it doesn't help. Is there any program that will let me play this in a windowed mode?"
,Vrannia,2009-08-04T22:56Z,"Okay, I got it to work in a windowed mode using dxwnd, but I can't see my mouse when I do this, which makes it hard to play.

Any suggestions for resolving the resolution issue?"
,The-Duck,2009-08-05T20:27Z,"not really recommended but...
you can always use a virtual machine like Sun xVM VirtualBox or any other.
That should solve your problem, but you can probably find an easier one."
