An underground heavy progressive power trio that recorded a legendary collector's item titled 4 Times Sound Razing. This album contained just four songs: "Chub Chub Cherry" (a short heavy rock song like a freaky Cream), "Brain Brain" (16 minutes of acid nightmares, continuously shifting tempo in an amphetamine-driven mayhem), "God" (a much more melodic attempt with powerful guitar arrangement, sounding like Black Sabbath meet Hendrix with a collective paranoia) and "Head Tear Of The Drunken Sun" (finished it all with 12 minutes of hazardous power trio pyrotechnics). As you will have gathered, this is an extreme album in many ways: the raw power, the cranky vocals, the restless arrangements, not forgetting the ugly silver gnome on the front sleeve! All trace of Silberbart disappeared after this album, which in itself gained them no recognition at all. A real shame, as some of their ideas were quite remarkable. Silberbart were a true power-trio
