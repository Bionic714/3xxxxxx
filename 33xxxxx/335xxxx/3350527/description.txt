Frank Renton conducts Grimethorpe Collery Band
with guest soloists: Maurice Murphy, Nicholas & Robert Childs, Don Lusher, Guy Barker,  Gordon Campbell, and Derek Watkins.

Starts with a ropey performance of Trumpet Blues & Cantabile.  Mo Murphy shows his pedigree with charivari, followed by the 'Childs' showing off their euph. kung-fu.  Hear Bog Flusher get completely outclassed by Gordon Campbell, Gay Biker should have stayed at home.  Ends with Derek 'the daddy' Watkins 'warming-up' for a couple of numbers, ending his 'set' with 'We've Only Just Begun'.  He finally lets you 'AVE IT, singing out on a 'dubba B'!  If you listen carefully you should be able to hear the front-row cornets quietly sobbing as they nurse their bleeding ears.
