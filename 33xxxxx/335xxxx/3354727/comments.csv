,russanet,2005-07-11T14:11Z,"Did you like it guys? This is brazilian music from Brazil, South America. That's very good indeed. There's much more from where it came. I can suggest some artists here: Fernanda Porto, Caetano Veloso, Tom ZĂŠ, Tom Jobim, JoĂŁo Gilberto, Marco Vale....

Enjoy all of them! ;-)"
,psychehead,2005-07-11T14:35Z,"Thanks for this, and yes please to more of the same, do you have all 8?"
,test78,2005-07-11T15:55Z,"psychehead: I have 7 albums in the the Love, Peace & Poetry series. I`ll upload them in the near future.  I`ll up the other albums as I get them :D

THanks for the tip russanet ! I really dont know a lot about the scene in Brazil, and I dont have that much brazilian psychedelia /tropicalia. This is a list from the top of my head of some of the brazilian stuff I have:

Gil gilberto, modulo 1000, os mutantes (probably the most famous from brazil?), satwa, sete bola (kickass guitarplayer) caetano veloso (not ALL the albums of course, my god has he released a lot of stuff) joyce, we all together (maybe they are from peru, cant remember right now really, great stuff anyway) marcos valle, tho he isnt really that psychedelic,  bwana (atleast I think bwana was from brazil), laghonia were from peru I suppose, tho Im not sure.

I`ll upload some of this if anyone is interested?"
