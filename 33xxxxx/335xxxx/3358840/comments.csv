,flygsvamp,2005-07-21T02:08Z,Can sometimes block certain webpages. My solution: change proxy (rightclick globe) or refresh webpage.
,kaffene,2005-07-21T04:05Z,Mas horible that it doesn't work with FireFox!
,AudioholicA,2005-07-21T09:06Z,"seems to be shit!
1.) you never have privacy in the internet.
2.) maybe you are safer in the net, if you're connecting to a proxy in sealand (or so) but even then your ip is known by your isp - it's just a matter of time to find you - if you're doing illegal things.
3.) 763kb's are too much for a proxy  configuration file :P
4.) hrhr - only works with ie? greatest shit! - this makes your pc open like a swiss cheese - never use ie - and better don't use this tool!
5.) never use software to configure your system - learn to configure it by hand&head - more software means more problems...
my english is not that good, but i hope u understand...
better don't use this crap"
,AudioholicA,2005-07-21T10:37Z,"i see you know better, use it and have fun with it... for those who knows about security holes in ie (or better in M$ products) it's just another funny joke... have fun with it & don't forget to use fdisk to improve your disk capacity :P "
,Theoretic,2005-07-21T16:02Z,"It works, but it doesnt fool whatismyip.com, I tried it on some forums I got banned from (IP), and I got access, quite a nice little toy. Thanks."
,ruva,2005-07-21T22:27Z,Maby you need to reed this ( http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3358807 ). I don't think is safe to visit the bank trou this program/proxy. 
,flygsvamp,2005-08-17T00:45Z,And maybe you should try to involve your brain in the process of understanding what you read. Hide IP is not a real proxy. Go to Shields up! and see if your computer is safe. It's your firewall that's your main concern.
,flygsvamp,2005-08-17T00:50Z,"To all those who bitch and say this doesn't work: it does - period. Study before speaking up. 
To Theoretic who can't fool www.whatismyip.com: are you kidding? Learn how to use the app, it's worth your time. By the way - I'm looking at a lot of spanish commercials right now to my right...and I'm not from Spain although whatismyip (and other sites) claim that I am."
