if yes can you give me the link for disc 3.

thank you"
,ravscool,2006-05-29T23:00Z,"Hi. Very soon i'll stop seeding my release for disc 5 season 2 from roswell show, but there's 2-3 other seeders now and + 8 leechers so the file should be fine if the seeders seed well i've uploaded 6.89Gb until now. Now soon i'll seed disc 3 from season 3,  because is the only one in this release that has no seeders and there's many people stuck at 98.8% for a long time. Be well roswellian fans."
