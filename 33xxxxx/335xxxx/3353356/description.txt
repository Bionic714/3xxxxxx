Roswell Season 2 DVD box - Disc 5. 
Source: Retail, PAL 
DVD-image .ISO divided into .rar segments for easier re-download in case of error. 
Created in DVD Shrink 3.2 with default settings, except for all French audio+subs removed. 
Extras+menu untouched. 
Audio: English 2ch+5.1 untouched. 
Subs: English. 
Video somewhat compressed (about 70% of original) so it would fit to one single-sided disc. 

--------- 
Since I lack for discspace and bandwidth, I can't seed this for long, so as soon as someone else is seeding, I'll drop it and upload the next disc. So, basically, if you want to see more discs, you'd better seed after download.
