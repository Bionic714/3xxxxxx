Robert Wyatt 1974-09-08 Drury Lane Theatre Royal London England (T-399)

This CD-r release was made mostly from a reel to reel tape recorded at 3 3/4 ips that I got in trade about 1975 or 1976.  I also used a cassette tape I got in trade in the early 90's to fill in the missing songs.  This has been one of my favorite shows since I first heard it.  I've listened to other versions that are available and this one sounds better and it is complete.  Other versions usually are missing the Julie Tippett songs and the stage announcements.  The artwork is from scans of a Xerox of the programme for that night.
