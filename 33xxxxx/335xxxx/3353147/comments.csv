Awesome review I totally agree.

If youre new to guitar wolf, definitely get Wild Zero, then buy their CDs (if you can very hard or impossible in north america).

The Guitar Wolf / Wild Zero combo gives the Ramones / Rock N Roll High School a run for the money.

,StormWolf611,2010-09-22T08:55Z,Im from America and just randomly downloaded this from music cuz i like hardcore heavy metal but i wasn't quite expecting this. i can't say anything bad about it but i was expecting something a little less staticy and digital. don't get me wrong i love japanese music i just don't like the garage style rock it gives me a bit of a headache but i think if they had better equipment they could be better
