,heistgonewrong,2005-07-10T06:38Z,Is this even real?
,twojeeze,2005-07-10T07:13Z,Can anyone confirm that this is the real deal?
,ribbz22,2005-07-10T13:48Z,"my guess is that it is real because if you look at Nforce.nl the file sizes match up perfectly.  I CANNOT WAIT TO HAVE THIS GAME BACKED UP!

^^"
,ribbz22,2005-07-10T13:51Z,"On second note I believe this is 100% real now because I started getting some files off of newsgroups for the riot release and those files were   built into the torrent when I started it

:D"
,ribbz22,2005-07-10T13:52Z,"sorry about the mass commenting -  my cable connection cut out and when i got back on there was like 4 posts extra

sorry"
,ribbz22,2005-07-10T17:19Z,"i am 1 file away (r23)  but when i try to run the torrent and it gets to 100% checking the files i have in there it says permission denied...not sure why, but if i can figure it out i can seed the game"
,twojeeze,2005-07-10T20:22Z,54% and ticking.  I also will be seeding this for a few days after I get 100%.  Maybe longer.
,ribbz22,2005-07-10T22:20Z,99.8 % for the last hour...ho hum
,twojeeze,2005-07-11T03:01Z,"I only hit submit once, why am I double posting?  Its not intentional."
,scb175,2005-07-11T09:25Z,"Seeds are picking up big time... everyone wants this.  I'll keep mine up for awhile as well.  Strange, i still dont see anyone have it 100% complete"
,XioNnN,2005-07-11T09:34Z,"hallå jag har en fråga jag brännde ut 2 st spel men inget av den funkade jag brännde i dvd decrypter med dvd-r kan någon säga vad det är för fel snälla tack på för hand

,JDB7821,2005-07-11T12:03Z,Anybody played this yet and care to comment?
,Peety615,2005-07-11T19:37Z,Can sombody please tell me how 2 burn tha iso
,Epson Man,2005-07-12T03:29Z,"Geez people, how about setting your uploads a little higher. I turn off your torrents if you aren't sharing. I suggest every1 else does the same. My downloads are only 13 & my uploads are 40!"
,Peety615,2005-07-12T19:03Z,This shyt dosen't work.
,chris86wm,2005-07-13T06:10Z,common guys at least seed for a day or two.
,blitzpa9,2005-07-13T15:21Z,"This game worked flawlessly for me.  I suggest downloading the rosters with names at: http://www.xbox-saves.com/pafiledb/pafiledb.php?action=file&id=3342

I've been seeding this for over a day now and I will continue to since EA doesn't deserve a penny of our money for being douchebags.
"
,chris86wm,2005-07-13T18:37Z,"lol, im gonna seed for a month!"
,Peety615,2005-07-13T20:05Z,yo can somone please tell me where tha iso is at because when i try to open tha zip files it says its damaged or somthing.
,bgibson8708,2005-07-13T21:46Z,"I extracted the ISO using XBOXISO. I then took the folder that it made and sent it to my hard drive with FTP.Then the game will start and it will show the loading and press start thing justs like normal and it will say select your team then automatically go into heisman mode, then it shows the video and then it freezes. Has anyone else had this happen and can anyone help me??"
,Epson Man,2005-07-14T07:48Z,"Save your time, game freezes up and will not let me install on HD. Gets dirty disk drive error.(it's not dirty, trust me). I think the problem is with the audio."
,ND3G,2005-07-15T04:16Z,"2254 downloads and only 6 seeders, that is just sad...."
,cualexander,2005-07-15T15:43Z,"To All who could not get this to work.  Do this.  Burn at 4x with DVD Decrypter.  I've burned 5 copies of this, this way and all of them play just fine!  No freezes that I've seen at all.  The first time you load the game, it will go into Heismann Mode automatically.  Just quit that and then it will go back to the main menu. "
,MItchy71,2005-08-03T14:44Z,"I have dloaded this twice now.  I have tried burning it every way possible (including with dvd decrypter) and can not get it to work.  One file always fails to copy onto my xbox.  I have burned three disks with this file and It still doesnt want to copy any of them.  The game starts, runs the intro, then the movie about the Heisman.  Then fades to black and I have to manually turn off my xbox. Thats as far as I can get.  I will rent the game and maybe seed a new torrent, as I really want to play this.  The file name is something like MNCMDEMO or the such."
,tt_moore,2009-09-11T08:44Z,Please seed
