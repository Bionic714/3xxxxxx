Power Metal quartet CITADEL began life during 1997 as a Gothic inclined outfit billed as SILMAETH. A series of line up reshapings saw then lead guitarist Petteri Urmas taking over the vocal role as the group evolved into its next incarnation as S.O.U.R. The group started to take on a new identity with the introduction of keyboard player Joona Kukkola in the Autumn of 1998, verring towards symphonic styled Power Metal. Progress stalled somewhat as band members undertook their national military service duties but in 2001 Mika Virtanen was incorporated on guitar, giving the group further impetus. By the close of that year the new name of CITADEL had been chosen for recording of a four track demo 'Vortex'.
