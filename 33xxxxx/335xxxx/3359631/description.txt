Hello. It's KHONNOR here. I'm a kid from Vermont who is 
swamped with homework and school! I'm really looking 
forward to college! My musical interests cover a broad
range of styles, and I think this comes through in my 
music. I try to capture as much emotion as I can in the
music that I make. Laugh. Cry. Tinkle. This is what i 
want you to feel from this Khonnor Experience! The 
story behind I, Cactus is very interesting. I, Cactus
is from northern Ireland. As a child I, Cactus had no 
idea of the magical systems and televisions that were 
to be invented in the next few years. Throughout the 
prolific career of I, Cactus as a musician, I, Cactus 
worked with many bands, and experimented with unique 
songmaking techniques. I, Cactus was born with a rare 
disorder which causes colors to be seen specific to 
keys and tones in the musical scale. The work of I, 
Cactus is the result of experimentation in expanding 
the field of 8bit aesthetics. I, Cactus is getting 
caught up on all that was missed during childhood, 
and has only recently discovered computers and console 
entertainment systems. I, Cactus is over 79 years old.

The deliciously delayed debut release from I, Cactus brings
you a short collection of sweet tunes filled with 
heartbreakingly innocent melodies. As you stroll along with
the sun at your back, one cute cactus after another 
bouncing happily behind you, with this carefree blend of 
chippy harmonies and clicky crunchy beats you'll never look
at a cactus the same way again. Featuring such treasures 
as "Bamboo Cactus" an unforgettable remix of Nullsleep's 
"Playful Panda" - this little cactus packs a big punch!
