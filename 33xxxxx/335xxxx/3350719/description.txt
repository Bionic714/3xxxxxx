imdb: "Telling the story of a Turkish man captured by the extra-terrestrials, parodises science-fictions such as 5th Element, Star Wars and Matrix...",

This is a Turkish science fiction movie (comedy) made by Cem Yilmaz (famous artist, comedian and caricaturist), that came out in 2004, I think the movie is very professionally made (especially compared to older turkish movies like the parodies of star wars, star trek..). it is hilarious and makes fun of many good scifi movies, yet it's quite good as a science fiction movie on it's own. I recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it.
