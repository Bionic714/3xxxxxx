Although we get upset about little furry foxes, we ignore how other animals are 
treated so as to keep the price of food low. This film shows, in graphic detail, 
exactly what happens in a small abattoir in Oldham both to the animals and the 
people who work there. It is not a film for the squeamish.

Executives are known to have called for several cuts to be made to the footage after 
they became nervous about the content. It is said that one of the employees has since
been dismissed and that this particular abattoir is facing court proceedings for 
infringements of the law.
