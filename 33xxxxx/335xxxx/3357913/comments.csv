Seems like it's installing, but after restarting tomtom the POI problem remains..."
,vraagmaarraak,2005-07-19T12:02Z,"Golfe, you must copy the files to your pocket pc first. and   open it from within your ppc with a program like  'file explorer'. don't open it directly from the PC. Hope i answered your question."
,Golfe,2005-07-19T13:20Z,"I did that. But is this files for Windows CE 4.2?
Thanks."

,ehsahog,2005-07-22T11:32Z,"It works perfectly on a Ipaq 1940 with the Scandinavia Plus map. Thanks!!

The installation hung when the SD card was in the device but worked fine when removed.
However, it seems to be a problem with the tracker protocol."

,woofiee,2005-08-05T12:56Z,This only patches v5.00 of TomTom. Any later vewsion will be overwritten and the benefits lost. So it's either POIs or fixes...
,woofiee,2005-08-11T12:52Z,"Yep - that might be it. I'm in the Benelux too and I can't navigate to a POI under the 5.1 version. I have reinstalled all the maps and re-done the install a few different ways as described, but I get no POI-luvin'..."
