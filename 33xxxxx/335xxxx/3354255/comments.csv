,v00lo,2008-01-07T23:30Z,"Dude,  a lot of Germans, Swedish OR Norway guys put a lot of games in English/native lang.

Description is always in their language when u write, to write the stuff down in English, they laughing at u, asking why to hell u don't know swedish ? besides the reason is so fucked up, i have no other ideas...punch me.
and there is no frakin problem u'd see that da name on the title says PL... deal w/ it.

polish is weird though... barely have occasion to hear it, but it always make me feel retarded. no comments on that one plz :P
