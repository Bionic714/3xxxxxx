Robert Calvert - Captain Lockheed And The Starfighters

An album with Robert Calvert (vocalist/poet in Uk spacerock legends Hawkwind), Lemmy Kilmister (of Hawkwind & Motorhead fame), Brian Eno on synthesizers(yepp, thats THE Brian Eno), Arthur Brown (from the crazy world of A.B.) - what kind of album would that make? 

The worlds first heavy metal space rock concept album, thats what ! and a seriously good album too, songs with a "silvermachine-era Hawkwind"/Lemmy kinda feel to it, mixed with seriously funny Monty Pythonesque vignettes between the killer songs. The songs/story revolves around true story of Germany's purchase of the Lockheed Starfighter jet..but I wont give away the whole story here :D

imho: tHis is the best album Hawkwind never made.
