,Frightener,2005-07-19T07:29Z,Great compilations of music. You get all the overplayed hits and some gems that don't get aired often.
,Kackacka,2005-07-21T18:00Z,seed please.. i have been on 99.9% in like 3 days
,Haywood Yublome,2005-07-27T13:43Z,The alternative times series is the only one I regularly look forward to- rock on!
,Brainiac885,2006-01-30T03:56Z,Can anyone seed please?
,Tranox,2006-04-13T22:14Z,I will probably help to seed this when I have gotten it from another source.
,Tranox,2006-04-13T22:18Z,"Remember to buy a cd or two of these albums :) 
Because they are worth it!"
,TJK-GaMeR,2006-05-04T20:40Z,"really thanks for this!

,Nolla,2006-11-04T20:42Z,Pleaaaaase seed. Bought some of these albums but there are just too many :P Really want to get this one :)
,twshadow101,2007-01-05T18:30Z,"Will somebody for the love of God please fucking seed. Why download a torrent and not share it? You want people to share so you can get what you fucking want, but when it comes down to sharing for others none of you fucking do it. SEED THIS DAMN TORRENT!"
,disseh,2007-01-06T18:37Z,There's a benefit to private trackers where users are forced to maintain a minimum share ratio. I've seeded this torrent for a few days now and well above my 1.0 ratio. I've also watched 4 or 5 others complete the download and stop seeding. I don't plan to give up my bandwidth to this torrent forever. Let's hope the next person that finishes this will seed it.
,Galaxxe,2007-01-10T18:51Z,I've started download it and I will seed it...so i will help :)
,specmurt,2007-03-11T00:54Z,"Nolla, where did you buy it? It's not for sale anywhere on the net."
,riccogrosse,2008-02-21T22:26Z,Plz seed...
,beso0282,2008-07-02T07:20Z,"I love these albums, but noone is seeding. Come on people! Share the music!"
,androidslayer,2008-07-22T08:59Z,Seeders? Pleeease!
