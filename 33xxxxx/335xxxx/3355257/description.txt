FortKnox is a file security program you can use to completely lock and hide files and/or entire folders on your hard drive.  Once the file or folder is locked and hidden, even the "view hidden files and folders" option in Windows Explorer doesn't show them, you simply can't even find them except without entering your password to start FortKnox to unlock them.
