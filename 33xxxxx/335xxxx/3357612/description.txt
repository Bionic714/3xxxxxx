Second album from this not-very-typical Krautrock-outfit. The music is heavy blues-rock with light prog touches, but not "heavy" in the same way like many such bands of the time tended to be. Singer/guitarist Joey Albrecht has a rather good, strong voice with a heavy accent that adds to the charm of this record. Lots of good Santana-esque instrumental work thru-out the album, with jazzy keyboards, heavy guitars and South American rhythms. Not an essential album to have in the collection but very well worth having a listen to imho.
