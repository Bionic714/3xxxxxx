Having fixed an exploded cable modem (just by swearing at it), one of our 
best friends, Connor Kirby-Long, is back -- this time with three new songs he 
wrote between classes and they're full of all kinds of well-crafted good stuff: 
pretty guitar melodies, spazzy cut-up percussion, bendy synth notes, and 
angelic vocals.

In the first track, 'Crapstone', Connor takes a handfull of loose stuff found in 
his jacket pocket and turns it into a daydreamy pop tune. And where 'The 
eyes of the older drivers' is a sort of carnivalesque examination of, um, older 
people driving, "Basement Key 555" is the grand and densely-produced 
foreshadowing of his upcoming album this spring on the stylish Type Records 
label with its heavy piano melody and catchy ending.

Should be a good year for Khonnor fans.
