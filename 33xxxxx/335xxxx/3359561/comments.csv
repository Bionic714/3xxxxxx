,Ssargon,2005-07-23T20:27Z,"Its the Rip I think, without any movies. Well, the movies isnt nude anyway so the game is not worse without them. ;-)

Atleast not if you want this for the nude patch. hehe"
,Gladiatorxxx,2005-07-24T03:55Z,"dont work !!

instal on HD and he dont start!!"
,dabwee,2005-07-24T04:53Z,"I extracted game but it won't transfer, using FlashFxp. Why would that be?"
,shady78,2005-07-24T04:55Z,the file name is to big rename it to somthing smaller that always works for me
,shady78,2005-07-24T04:55Z,never mind its an iso you gotta use a progam called qwix to tranfer the iso over
,dabwee,2005-07-24T05:00Z,So is this the full game and is it actually got a nude patch or something?
,evandando,2005-07-24T13:23Z,can i burn this game to a dvd? does it works? or do i have to transfer it to the hdd??
,shady78,2005-07-24T14:33Z,"1. yes girls are completely nude tities bush and all


2. yes you can burn to dvd"
,shady78,2005-07-24T14:34Z,as far as i gathered only thing missing is movies i got this from a programm called dc++ and ther is very liyyle inf as to wheter whats been cut or not there
,evandando,2005-07-24T14:50Z,"hum, it sounds great, hope it will work ;D "
,Vega,2005-07-25T23:18Z,"Did what Finest said, moved all the SFD files, the only difference from the black screen and working HDD from last time was that the sound kicked in, and I was in the game.. but the screen was still black.. tips? Im not an idiot like most ppl who just impulsively ask about any lil thing, but this is beyond me. Grateful for any comment."
,shadgenki,2005-07-26T03:27Z,This is great. Any chance of getting this cut version of the actual game w/o nude patch?
,shady78,2005-07-26T03:38Z,sorry this is how i got it i dunno if there is a way to remove the patch from the existing iso
,moeiluku,2005-07-26T22:14Z,"hey guys, i have a problem. I downloaded the games Starwars III Revenge Of The Sith (Request) and Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volley Ball (Nude)(Reque. I extracted both games with winrar, then i loaded the iso file into ""daemon tools"" and then i choose dvd copy i Nero. With the game 'Starwars III Revenge Of The Sith' it works perfectly but with 'Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volley Ball (Nude)' Nero gives an error called: ""the disk is blank or invalid. Please insert original disc"" I did exactly the same things as i did with Star Wars. Can somebody help me please...."
,shady78,2005-07-27T00:14Z,i dunno bout nero i use dvd dycrypter to burn its freeware all i did was drag the iso over top the dvd dycrypter icon on desktop the dvd dycryp loads and put disc in and choose write plays fine worked good for me
,KaizerSozei,2005-07-27T01:09Z,"game works perfectley dextracted with winrar  extaract the iso with ""xiso by GUI"" made an udf image with nero and burned  thanx for another one shady 78"
,thorst13,2005-07-27T16:54Z,"Just extract it and burn ISO in Nero, remember to change the burn to dvd!"
,moeiluku,2005-07-27T22:38Z,"TO: thorst13 
that is the weirdest thing, that is just what i did. Normally it works perfectly, i already burned 40 games this way. I Probably would be my fault. I'll just take another look. Thnx"
,thorst13,2005-07-28T03:04Z,"moeiluku , try to set the burn speed to a low like 4X if youre still having problems!"
,SimUser,2005-07-30T22:51Z,"Why are you trying to use nero-copy? just use nero to burn the iso file, XP doesn't recognize the format of the iso files."
,Ssargon,2005-08-02T01:42Z,have ANYONE got this to work on the harddrive? I really would like it to work from my harddrive in the Xbox since this is the main attraction for this rip. The original game is 4 GB large. :-P
,InsomniacNC,2005-08-03T09:13Z,"I downloaded this and put it on my harddrive and it did not work , I did the moving files to media or whatever but it still did not work off my harddrive , I do not have a DVD burner but just a cdrw burner : /     ."
,InsomniacNC,2005-08-03T10:34Z,"hmm , I got it to work but the screen flickers really crazily but I can somewhat see the game , is there a way to fix that? My game region or whatever is set to auto ."
,shady78,2005-08-05T07:29Z,sorry i cant help i never got it to work off my hdd it was just a black screen but it worked perfectly when i burnt to disc 
,shady78,2005-08-05T07:29Z,try setting game reign to default
,Mackanen,2005-08-10T10:14Z,This one doesnt work...the only game ever I didnt get to work...If someone knows how to..please let me know..
,eetubest,2006-01-09T14:16Z,seeds!!!!
,stealthboyzx3,2006-05-01T15:17Z,hey insomniac did you ever get it to work?
,ztaticx,2006-05-23T20:22Z,"I completed the download. It works when I burned it into a DVD-RW sic. The game was perfect and ran with no problem. Then I burned the iso into a DVD-R, but when the ""Legal Disclaimer"" ends scrolling-up, NOTHING HAPPENS!!! THEN I burned it AGAIN into the SAME DVD-RW disc and NOTHING HAPPENS AGAIN!! It worked for me only once. Anybody with an idea? All my burns where executed in the same way."
,ztaticx,2006-05-23T20:25Z,"By the way, I'll be re-seeding this for a while, with the hope of somebody help me with my issue."
,Prometheum,2006-12-15T04:35Z,"I see the anti-piracy warning, and then a blank screen. Is it detecting that its a burned copy?

shady, I know its probably burnensome, seeing as you are probably the lead source of xbox games, but could you see if this is correct or not? I think this is probably a formatting error, I've done exactly what I've done with about 50 other games, and now I've wasted a dvd as I don't have an HDD mod. Could we get a repost of a more verified version, please?"
,mxrider108,2007-05-01T03:18Z,Can someone please seed this some more? Thanks!
,chaosechidna,2008-09-16T21:51Z,"I got this to work on a DVD+R, HP Brand. BTW I bought a 100 pack of DVD+R's for $25 (US cash) at staples."
,caribico,2009-02-10T18:26Z,what's the use to be here??? NO FUCKING SEEDERS BUT LOTS OF ASSHOLES!!!!
