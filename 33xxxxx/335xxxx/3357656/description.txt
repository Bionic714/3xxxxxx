Jaffa notes:

With the original Pogues lineup recently reunited, their entire back catalogue of studio albums has been digitally
remastered and reissued - with extra bonus tracks included on each album. JAFFA is quite pleased to be able to
bring you everything (of note) that this great band put down on record. Peace & Love was originally issued in 1989.


"Shane MacGowan's potent appetite for alcohol was evident from the time the Pogues cut their first album, but by the
time they got to work on Peace and Love in 1989, it was evident that he'd gone far past the point of enjoying a few
pints (or many pints) and had sunk deep into drug and alcohol dependence. The Pogues were always far more than just
MacGowan's backing band, but with the group's principal songwriter and lead singer frequently unable to rise to the
occasion, the recording of Peace and Love became a trying experience, with the rest of the band often scrambling to
take up the slack for their down-for-the-count frontman. Given the circumstances, the Pogues deliver with greater
strength than one might expect on Peace and Love; while MacGowan's vocals are often mush-mouthed and his songwriting
is markedly beneath his previous standards, Terry Woods contributes two terrific traditional-style numbers ("Young Ned
of the Hill" and "Gartloney Rats"), Philip Chevron's "Lorelei" is a superb tale of lost love (he and Daryl Hunt also
teamed up for a fine bit of Celtic-calypso fusion on "Blue Heaven"), and Jem Finer brought along a trio of strong
originals. Musically, Peace and Love found the band stretching their boundaries, adding accents of film noir jazz on
"Gridlock," rockabilly on "Cotton Fields," straight-ahead rock on "USA," and power pop on "Lorelei," though the group's
highly recognizable Celtic-trad-on-steroids style is never far beneath the surface. Peace and Love isn't as good as the
two Pogues albums that preceded it (which represent the finest work of their career), but it does make clear that Shane
MacGowan was hardly the only talented songwriter in the band Ã¹ though the fact that the set's most memorable songs were
written by others did not bode well for the group's future."  (AMG)

Group News: JAFFA is looking for: A few good men. Or women. You can probably guess what for.. You have
to be a totally hard-core bad-ass individual who's on irc 24/7, but at the same time we don't want uber-
serious, super-boring ones, nor opportunists, nor those who speak lies. Nor robinson-jerry. Also, you
have to be 18 years old minimum, and like Music a lot, and be familiar with, or at least have heard of,
bands/artists such as Ramones, Dropkick Murphys, or Flogging Molly. That's it. If you think you fit the bill,
all that's left to do is to somehow get in touch with the JAFFA Supreme Overmind. Someone you know may know
someone else who has in turn once spoken to someone that..etc, etc, etc.
