Due to the incredible popularity of the television show, the producers were under a lot of pressure to put together an incredible soundtrack to back "The X-Files: Fight the Future" up. At first glance, the disc looks aptly huge, featuring artists like Foo Fighters, Björk and Sting. How does it stand up? Surprisingly, the smaller groups are the ones providing the best music within. However, it's disappointing to see the inclusion of already-released cuts, like Bjork's "Hunter" and a forcibly altered version of Sarah McLachlan's "Black".
