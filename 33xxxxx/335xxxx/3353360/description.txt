Notes:

I had to edit performance of Kanye West because of "channeljumping" In swedish television. Sorry for that. One song by him had to go because of bad picture quality. Another coming on next disc. On this disc It's hit with phrase "....diamonds are forever...", I don't know the name of the song.

Now I'm back with same menu as In disc 1. 

I know It's undersized but It's nearly impossible to make exactly 4.4 gig and not edit In artist performance. I had to do It with this disc (Kanye West) because of "channeljumping".
