,HSMistress,2005-07-08T15:20Z,"Great!! Many thanks for this post. I know it is a lot of work, and it is much appreciated!! 
Thanks to Whiteshadow also, for the great covers!!"
,Ritsch,2005-07-08T17:00Z,I'm done with disc 4. I wait for more complete sources of disc 3. More info of disc 4 later.  After that it's maybe oner or two more discs to go. I had a quick look and I think I'm forced to make two more discs after disc 4. I can't squeeze the rest of mpegs to one last disc.
,andibi,2005-07-08T22:46Z,"Hello again Ritsch! Great work and glad to hear you will be sharing a few more discs. I've already watched the first two discs with my wife here in Tokyo. In a few more hours (as I write it's 10:30 pm Stockholm time), I and many others around the world will have disc 3 on our hard discs. The layout, menu work, and scene transitions on disc 2 are excellent. Keep up the great work. I'll be seeding them all and hope many of you out there will too. Cheers, andibi ..."
