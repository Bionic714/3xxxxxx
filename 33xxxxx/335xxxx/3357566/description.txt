 Political consultant Karl Rove stands accused of
 outing CIA agent Valerie Plame, whose husband Joe
 Wilson had outed Bush & Blair's claims that Saddam
 Hussein had been hunting for Uranium in Niger. This
 piece of tit-for-tat might well end Rove's career,
 which could be not-very-interesting, were it not
 that he is known as 'Bush's brain'. Not only was Rove
 instrumental putting Bush into the presidency, but
 he  continues to play a dominsnt behind the scenes   
 role in the administration. And therefore in running 
 the world..
 
 This documentary film is an examination of Rove's
 role in George W. Bush's political career. 

'BUSH'S BRAIN is sure to be one of the most
 explosive documentaries about American politics in a 
 decade.'
