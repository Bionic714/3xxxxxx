i dont know how start it"
,REVOS,2005-08-09T09:00Z,"to get this game to work, download the fastloader from www.blackcats-games.com. You have to register.

Or you can download this file from blackcats games:
""NBA2K5 Full Crack, No UMD with WiFI Support ""

This supports wifi as you can see"
,REVOS,2005-08-09T09:09Z,"The easiest way to get the game to work is to use the fastloader, but i dont know if wifi works, havent tried it yet. 

1. Install the fastloader into your x:PSPGame folder. You need KXPloit to install the program and firmware 1.5.

2. In the root of your MS, create two folders. ""ISOMISC"" and ""ISO"". 

3. Copy the ISO file (the game you've downloaded) to the ISO folder. In the ISOMISC folder you can put a background picture with a specific size, but you dont have to. You can leave it empty. 

4. Start Fastloader from the PSP, the game that is in the ISO folder should show up. 
Before you press X to start the game, remove any UMD. After you have pressed X it tells you to put in any UMD, so do it. Now the game should work."
