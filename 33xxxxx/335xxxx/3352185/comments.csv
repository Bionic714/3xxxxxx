,mogto,2005-07-05T05:52Z,"It's a documentary from / an episode of BBC's ""Horizon"" science programme, about ""Global Dimming"", i.e. that less and less sunlight seems to be reaching the Earths surface.  It also goes into the relationship between global dimming and global warming, and that the latter could actually be a lot worse than we've thought."

Excellent video, download and watch to learn how, at current rates, by 2025 the Earth's temperatures will rise by 5 degrees celcius, begining the melting of the greenland ice shield and the polar ice caps.  Wow are we screwed.

PLEASE DISTRIBUTE"
,backdrop,2005-07-06T15:19Z,"Global Dimming, a phenomenon caused by small particles from car exhaust and industry pollution that clings to the water droplets that form clouds. This causes the coulds to relfect more light and heat back into the atmosphere.
That effect, alone, actually causes the temperature to fall... But since the atmosphere has gone warmer, this spells trouble for the near future.
There has actually been one factor cooling down the earth, while greenhouse gases have been warming it up. Without the particles clinging to coulds, the earth would be much hotter by now.
This is whats worrying the climatologists: We are getting much better at reducing pollution, but in doing so, we actually remove the particles that have been protecting us from up to 30-40% of the sunlight in some areas.
If we stop polluting, we will solve the greenhouse gas problem, but we will add the problem of clear skies, making the earth warmer... This can actually happen very fast, in a few years.
Watch the doc. It's good."
,FredTheMole,2005-07-07T09:44Z,If anyone has more of the BBC Horizon series I'd be interested in seeing some of their other episodes.  Thanks much for this one!

,4ntifl4g,2006-05-05T21:04Z,"these horizon shows focus too much on fear and drama and should be more scientific without the scary music, I'm not watching a horror movie, although global dimming is a serious danger, it shouldn't strive to entertain, just to educate"
,Klose1,2007-04-21T01:29Z,can someone seed!! Need this film for a school-project! thx =)
