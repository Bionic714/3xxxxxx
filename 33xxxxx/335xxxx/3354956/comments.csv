,devil75,2005-07-11T21:36Z,"i'v see movies with low mb,they don't have to be in a bad quality, like hostage perfect quality, just 346mb."
,devil75,2005-07-12T00:07Z,"picture quality is fine ,but sound could be better :)

no need to convert it to anything ,just play it in vlc player"
,FMX199,2005-07-12T01:18Z,hur får man lite fart på det här ???
,dazgh,2005-07-12T01:29Z,"I've tried this in loadsa players and it kepps jumpin allova the place, does anyone have any ideas for the best player"
,FMX199,2005-07-12T02:25Z,funkar ju inte . testat me vlc å wmp
,KalleKofot,2005-07-12T03:09Z,Could someone tell me what prog to use for mp4? non that Spank said works for me.
,seriously_chi,2005-07-12T03:21Z,"I downloaded this movie and it looks good. I downloaded the MPEG-4 codec,called3ivx but it didn't work. i ended up playing the movie in my videolan player. i want to burn this movie can anyone guide me on how to do this one. This is my first time dealing with MP-4 files."
,spank,2005-07-12T04:03Z,ok for those of you that want to convert this either get winavi and convert it or get nero ultra edition and install nerovision express with nero digital and recode 2....and to play the file you can use vlc media player or nero media player they above do work...
,spank,2005-07-12T04:51Z,get the updated version of vlc m8 0.8.2 i know all works well cos i use everything ive suggested myself..by the sounds of things it sounds like you have a codec problem
,votemarvel,2005-07-12T06:17Z,"Burning Red Ivanhoe, .mp4 is a higher level codec than divx and its like, so smaller sizes are possible. The only quality issue I've had with .mp4 with outer downloads in this format is that the picture does lose a little bit of sharpness, but that's a small gripe for a free movie.

Oh and .mp4s can be watchde on a PSP if you have one."
,votemarvel,2005-07-12T06:26Z,"seriously_chi, as well as the other suggestions, you could try using DVDSanta to convert .mp4.

It doesn't showup in the window until you select ""All Files"" but once you do that, it can be added and converted fine. Its the program I've used in the past to create DVDs out of mp4 downloads."
,Kaluminatie,2005-07-12T07:59Z,Is this the new movie out?
,sinfulldeeds,2005-07-12T09:30Z,iv only been downlowding mp4 like shara and its perfect dvd perfect so lay off of spank's hi did a great job      but dude send me a message i would your tricks of YOUR trade like what programe i should use to burn all formats on to a dvd i need a really good burning programe get back to me M8 your friend SinfullDeeds.
,noremlac,2005-07-12T10:18Z,"To bad, didn't work out for me in VLC. Pixel f-ups all the time"
,FMX199,2005-07-12T10:53Z,"does not work !!! vlc crashes!!! and i cant convert it with eny of the progs u listed.
using vlc 072
and btw vlc has allways bin able to play enything."
,LETCHO,2005-07-12T12:04Z,"spank...   http://pic.puretna.com/avatar/full/118251_clapping.gif

   thank you....picture&sound=OK"
,votemarvel,2005-07-12T17:10Z,"You can get it working my installing Nero's Digital package and convert easily with DVDSanta.

As to the quality of the this release, the picture is great but as I'ce said before, like a lot of .mp4s it does lack a little picture sharpness (not that it matters for a free download ) and I'm not sure but the audio does seem to be just ever so slightly out of synch but that could jsut be my hearing.

An excellent release, thanks fior uploading it."
,Flyforty,2005-07-12T18:31Z,lolz lolz .mp4 files works on quicktime for me >_
,votemarvel,2005-07-12T20:25Z,"personally I hate quicktime and refuse to let it on my system, after AOL and Realplayer, its the worst program for throwing icons around your computer."
,vicke_,2005-07-12T22:06Z,Latest VideoLAN (videolan.org) plus ffdshow (sourceforge.net/projects/ffdshow) solves all flickering/stretching problems
,dow,2005-07-12T23:11Z,"quicktime 7 plays all mp4s quite well... and I am lucky enough to have a mpeg decoder chip... and angel there is a term for mp4 video and audio seperately: m4a - audio | m4v - video, mp4 is just a media wrapper like AVI or MOV"
,ATLien1,2005-07-13T01:55Z,"Plays great with Nero Showtime!
Now burning it to a DVD, is a different thing."
,darksoad,2005-07-13T03:30Z,Fuckin´ awesome Dude.... thanx a lot... I really like Mp4...all movies can be released in MP4 Woooooooooooow
,vicke_,2005-07-13T04:13Z,This movie isn´t the best movie ever made...

,mawurscht,2005-07-13T18:39Z,get latest VLC 0.8.2 - no problem playing it and fine quality ..u don't need anything else
,scstump,2005-07-13T20:58Z,I've been converting mp4's to avi by using Xilisoft 3GP Video converter. 1st I convert mp4 to 3gp files and then convert the 3gp to avi or to divX avi and this seem to work out just fine . It enlarges the video format with minimum if any distortion
,Jamas,2005-07-14T10:03Z,"This mp4 is made from the same file as the fantastic 4 svcd (filmed in some theaher via cam) so the quality is as low as in that file. This is the same version, trust me I have seen both versions."
,spank,2005-07-14T23:15Z,damn what you want blood. soon as a better release comes out i will convert it untill then stop winging..
,Diabolus666,2005-07-15T11:34Z,Can watch it but cant convert it with winavi or nero like u said  tryed 10 diff converters all caqn convert the audio but not video and yes they r mp4 converters 
,robbimj,2005-07-15T20:21Z,"No this isn't a bs upload, Burning Red.  Is is great quality for the size. Why would you consider it a bs upload when so many other ppl say it is great? "
