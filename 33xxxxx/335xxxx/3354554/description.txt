This is the live performance from 2003 in the kodak theatre

DVD to XVID, 90minutes full live concert in fantastic quality,you must see

The girls are really good looking and all professional musicians.
Emili Robison plays the dobro, 5 string banjo and sings the harmony voice, although she's pregnant !!

I hope you'll enjoy
