,GKraften,2008-03-06T01:13Z,"I think I'll just refrain from commenting on the practice of downloading songs from a band and then saying they suck... You clearly have way too much bandwidth, HD space and time on you hands.

I must point out, however, that there is little helpfulness in pointing out that another comment isn't helpful.

I also think that it's pointless to point out (three times in a row) that the band indeed doesn't suck; or even that they rule.

Oh, and by the way: MCR rules! Yeah!

In case you couldn't tell, I am completely aware that this comment is no better in any way... I just have way too much time on my hands :)

Finally, my reason for posting: Thanks for the upload, I've been looking for this for some time now."
