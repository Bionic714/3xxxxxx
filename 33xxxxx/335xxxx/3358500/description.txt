I haven't seen this episode on any torrent yet, even though it first aired April
24 2005. Episode numbers for this show are a bit screwy but as far as I can
determine this is s02e26. Good XVID quality (1032kbps) rip.

Synopsis: The Harvey family living in hurricane ravished Florida, are living in a
termite infested home with water logged ceilings. Mr Harvey, having been diagnosed
with adult epilepsy, cannot work. His wife has to pick up the burden by working 2
jobs. Mr Harvey works by helping his neighbors with odd jobs pro bono. His college
age son moves back into the home to help with the bills. The Harveys apply to EMHE
and Ty Pennington and ABC come to the rescue.
