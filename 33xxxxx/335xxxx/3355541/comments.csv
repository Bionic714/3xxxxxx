If you have downloaded the dvd's but deleted the torrent afterwards please re-download this torrent, start the torrent and after the files are allocated just stop the download. Replace the allocated files with the original download files. Do a re-check of the torrent and the Client should see that the files are ok and ready for seeding.
This is assuming that you have backed up the Iso's to dvd or are still on your HD.
There are 24 Peers who would like to get the rest of the 10% of this torrent.
PLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzz... :D"
