,hauguem,2005-07-16T06:57Z,"Great, works perfect or better.  This is a great FPS for PSP.  Maybe the only FPS.  Needs a 256M card.  Thanks for the up."
,rombic,2005-07-16T23:10Z,"cound not make this one work , any hints? please?"
,Sontiago,2005-07-17T18:24Z,Works perfectly as stated. Make sure you put the COA_GAME directory on the root of the memory stick.  Also the rest goes in the psp/game directory.  Requires any umd.  I used Ridge Racer with firmware 1.5.

,DAsH,2005-07-27T02:03Z,"I cant get this baby to work, but i bloody want to, so can anyone be kind and help out a little bit?

I've done as it sais, copied COA_GAME to root and the rest to psp/game, only get to the LOADING screen when i start it from my mem card, not reading from any umd i have in drive.. do i need to do anything else first?
Have 1.5 firmware and all that shit, all other games work fine for me

Thanks in advance"
