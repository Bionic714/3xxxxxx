Smart Bomb delivers a tense gameplay experience as players are faced with a series of fast paced, challenging 3D puzzles based around diffusing sophisticated AI bombs. Gamers are faced with a series of bomb modules split into tiers and each tier must be disabled to unlock the next. As a tier is disabled the player moves closer to the detonator at the core of the bomb which must be deactivated before moving onto a new challenge. Single player action includes story, arcade and challenge modes while multiplayer mode challenges four players in a series of head to head gaming action. The story in Smart Bomb begins a decade ago, an unknown aggressor held the world to ransom with a series of highly sophisticated AI bombs planted at key locations around the globe. In response, the Global Defence Network assembled an elite reaction force â€“ the Bomb Disposal Unit (B.D.U.) to neutralize the threat and restore order.
