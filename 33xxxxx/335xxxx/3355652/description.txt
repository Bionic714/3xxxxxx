The pal version never worked on my North American XBOX, which was a surprise as most pal games work with my x3 chip, however with some hunting and searching i came up with the NTSC version of this great game, so whoever needs it like i did enjoy!

   Description:

   	Project Gotham Racing 2 is the ultimate test of racing 
   skill, style, and daring that rewards you not only for how 
   fast you drive, but also for how you drive fast. Earn Kudos 
   and gain recognition for cornering on two wheels around the 
   Sears Tower in Chicago; power sliding through the ancient 
   streets of Florence, Italy; or maneuvering along the racing 
   line through the slick streets of Edinburgh, Scotlandâ€”all 
   while racing some of the most exotic high-performance vehicles 
   available. Challenge other gamers online, utilizing Xbox Live, 
   or take on your friends in a multiplayer race via System Link.

   Notes:

	Game was too big to fit on DVD5, so we ripped 
   demos that were included with the game, sorry for the 
   inconvenience.
