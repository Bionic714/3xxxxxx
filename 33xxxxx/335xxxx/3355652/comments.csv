,wilcoxrd,2008-04-30T22:09Z,"WORKS!!! but not a easy fix. The file is a ""rar file"", that is fine and inside is an iso. The issue is that the iso file is not of an xbox format, it also isn't a normal iso (you can't open and see the contents). If you open it with ""win rar"" you can see the contents and extract it. The contents can either be directly transfered to xbox via network or you need to re-create an iso with craxtion or similar program. Basically it works but you need an extra step."
