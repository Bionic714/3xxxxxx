Stampede bio:

Hard Rock band formed by ex-LAUTREC man Rueben Archer with step-son Laurence Archer, STAMPEDE made the unusual step of debuting with a live album, recorded at the Reading Festival, before recording a full blown, studio affair. LAUTREC achieved minor acclaim by supporting SAXON and Rueben Archer was briefly a member of LIONHEART before joining Jimmy Bain's WILD HORSES in June of 1981 with Laurence and another former LIONHEART member, erstwhile DEF LEPPARD drummer Frank Noon.

The two Archers and Noon left the sinking ship that was WILD HORSES and formed STAMPEDE in early 1982 in alliance with bassist Francois Moreau and WILD FIRE credited keyboard player Alan Nelson. They were almost immediately snapped up by Polydor. However, Noon left to join WAYSTED and was replaced by Eddie Parsons. The bass position changed too, as Moreau was superseded by STORMTROOPER's Colin Bond. In this line up STAMPEDE cut 1982’s ‘Official Bootleg’ and follow up ‘Hurricane Town’.

Unfortunately, the group's early promise failed to propel them into the big league and STAMPEDE split in 1983, leaving Laurence Archer free to join Phil Lynott's GRAND SLAM, L.A. SECRETS in 1985, Spanish based TARZEN during 1986, RHODE ISLAND RED and then UFO for their ‘High Stake And Dangerous Men’ album. Laurence also gained co-production credits on WRAITH's 'Danger Calling' album. Keyboard player Alan Nelson would journey on through stints with ESCAPE, STRATUS and the ROBIN GEORGE band whilst Bond joined the BERNIE TORME band and worked with MEAT LOAF.

Another ex-STAMPEDE man, former STREETFIGHTER guitarist Dave Cenzak, joined London act BLACKFOX in 1985. A solo LAURENCE ARCHER album billed ‘Odds & Sods’ arrived in 1998.
