Remove this crap!"
,Thorlord,2005-07-11T09:17Z,"to let everyone know the patches out currently for BF2 have leaks in them. EA recommends NOT installing the patches and waiting for the next batch of patches (v1.02 or something)

i recently bought the game, and i HAVE seen the difference. You will think you are using a 56k modem to play the game with the patch. (even in single player!)"

,yakoob135,2005-07-12T16:51Z,"Thorlord I totally agree with you I d/l'd the patch from EA and it totally buggered me game up, slowed it down, reported ridiculous pings, kicked me from servers.....you would think after so long in the making they would get it right!
The search interface is crap...if it aint broke dont fix it"
