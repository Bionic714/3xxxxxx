TMPGEnc DVD Author is the DVD authoring program from the makers of the widely used TMPGEnc MPEG-1/2 encoder. 

It is geared towards beginners in DVD authoring, or people who only need a simple authoring solution. 

The program does not allow you to create your own menus from scratch, link them as you like or create your own buttons. Rather, it offers you facilities to automatically generate the appropriate menus for your content (even animated if you like). 

Being geared towards beginners, the program does not advanced features like multiple audio tracks, subtitles, etc.

This is the easiest DVD Authoring utility I've used - big plus!
