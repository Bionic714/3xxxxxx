,Zyqwux,2005-07-02T16:38Z,I don't understand what you are talking about.
,Zyqwux,2005-07-03T16:09Z,"Hehehe, yeah!"
,mikerm,2005-07-03T18:36Z,"hmmm command.com is not present, no way of making a bootable floppy with the files the way they are io.sys and msdos.sys are there but without command.com we aint going anywhere"
,Zyqwux,2005-07-03T21:05Z,It should probably create that file.
,Zyqwux,2005-07-03T21:09Z,"On the first disk, DOSSETUP.INI is telling the computer how it shall be created. Have you tested to install? Didn't it work?"
,D0nZiero,2006-01-04T12:11Z,"is it MS-DOS who drive 16biters ?

,ldx94,2006-10-26T02:12Z,"Hey, is it possible for anyone to seed this :)"
,atmo,2006-12-04T19:43Z,"Or you could just get a (non broken) version via Microsoft's page (yes, it's true)

That is only an upgrade from DOS 6, 6.1 og 6.2. You still need a valid install of DOS before being able to use that step-up you are linking to."

,juron99,2008-08-19T02:59Z,I've tried installing this and it doesn't work for me either. No Command.com
,skwiez,2008-08-20T20:06Z,"The archive is definitely missing necessary system files (command.com, io.sys, msdos.sys). Also, it's in Swedish and won't work with English system files."
,hzwazwa,2008-10-28T12:20Z,"Archive isn't missing anything, but the language is a bit of a barrier. I don't trust myself to ferret out the message ""ok to overwrite you complete c-drive with yestermillenium's OS?"" in scribbles that I only superficially recogize from the Holy Grail intro. 

Monty Python Rocks."
,segamanxero,2009-02-03T17:28Z,"I downloaded this torrent a wile ago, and it worked for me. For those who are having trouble, you need a ms-dos boot disk in order to use these. Perferibly using it to format your target drive as a bootable drive ""format C: /s"" or something like that.

You can get such boot disks at bootdisk[dot]com, like I did."
,Cheesedoodle,2009-02-25T16:48Z,jadedenni is weird
,Cheesedoodle,2009-02-27T04:22Z,i have the origional MS-DOS COMMAND.COM. i will provide a link soon
,nottastud,2009-11-21T04:38Z,http://ms-dos7.hit.bg/ if you guys want decent upgrade. Going to try it in a virtual machine and check it out.
