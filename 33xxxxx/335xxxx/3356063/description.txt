RELEASE NOTES/DESCRIPTION:
  In 1974 the New York City music scene was shocked into consciousness by a band of misfits from Queens called the Ramones. Playing in a seedy Bowery bar to a small group of fellow struggling musicians, the band struck a dissonant chord that rocked the foundation of the '70s music scene. This quartet of unlikely rock stars connected with the disenfranchised everywhere, sparking a movement that would resonate with two generations of outcasts across the globe. Although the Ramones never reached the top of the charts, they endured in the face of fleeting success and crushing interpersonal conflicts by maintaining a rigorous touring schedule for more than 22 years. Tracing the history of the band, from its unlikely origins through its bitter demise, END OF THE CENTURY is a vibrant candid document of one of the most influential groups in the History of Rock.
