LYd was a US heavy band from the late 60s early 70s. This is their second (and last) LP as far as I know. A rare LP that fetches a lot of money whenever a copy is up for auction. The group also recorded a selftitled album called Lyd in 1970. An extremely rare recording and you`d have to pay a ridiculous amount of money to get your hands on it. 

This is a fine piece of heavy guitarbased psychedelia from Hollywood 1971. The album is steeped in acid-soaked druggy lyrics and riffs, with a garage kinda feel to it - quite good if you ask me :D 

Ripped to 192kbs.

Enjoy !
