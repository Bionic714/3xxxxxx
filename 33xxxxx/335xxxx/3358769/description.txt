Description:

The bonus DVD is broken down into three menu items. They are Pre-Production, Production and Post-Production. You can choose to play all featurettes, view all artwork or view all photos.

Pre-Production starts with Star Beast: Developing the Story, which discusses its origins from Dan O'Bannon's work. The Visualists: Direction and Design talks about designing the sets and includes a lot of conceptual artwork Truckers in Space: Casting discusses the cast and features Sigourney Weaver's screen test.

Production has Fear of the Unknown, a 24-minute featurettes made in 1978 during production. The Darkest Reaches: Nostromo and the Alien Planet covers the design of the ship and the alien world, obviously, The Eighth Passenger: Creature Design is focused on how the alien was made, from Giger's artwork to the lanky African actor who wore the suit. There's a multi-angle look at the legendary chestburster scene and a gallery of H.R. Giger's work.

Post-Production kicks off with Future Tense: Editing and Music. We get seven deleted scenes, three of which were going to be included in the director's cut but were dropped at the last minute. Some of the scenes would slow the movie down even more, or be redundant, but I do wish they had kept the scene where Ripley and Lambert make peace.
