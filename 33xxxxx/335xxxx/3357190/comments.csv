,Rihs,2005-07-17T23:52Z,"It works! But if you still got some problems go to their homepage www.ageofazeroth.net and look in join section, there you can also download game and follow instructions how to join the shard."
,harsivo,2005-07-18T10:32Z,"I think this is only meant to use with age of azeroth ""shard"", when loggin in just write account name (whatever you want), and passworld, and press enter. Maybe it could be modified to use with other shards, dont know how...."
