Inspired by Beck and Jack Johnson, Matthew McAvene fuses original lyrics and music through acoustic exstream of consciousness.  This is very unique music and very well produced with all sorts of instrumentation (cello, banjo, mandolin, acoustic guitars and great bass lines and drum parts).
A debut record from Matthew McAvene, but already being released on a compilation CD with G. Love & Special Sauce, Nine Mile and Adam Topol's side project (Jack Johnson's drummer).
