,xarvidx,2006-05-28T11:47Z,"PLEASE SEED, I'm stuck @ 99,7. I really really want this."
,aksyonoff,2008-02-19T10:38Z,Please seed it! Thanx! 
,Abram03,2009-01-08T17:18Z,"Great jazz!  Thanks, Ulyana!  Alas, like everyone else, my download is sitting at 99.7%.  In my case---and I suspect everyone else's, too---this amounts to only one missing side:  ""To To Blues"" on disc 2.  If someone could step in long enough to seed this remaining .3%, I'd be very grateful and will happily help seed.  If not, no biggie---'cause I still got a lot of Lang and Venuti for nothing.  Thanks!"
