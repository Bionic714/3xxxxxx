,Nexus-6,2005-07-23T14:29Z,This video has english spoken with german or something dubbed over the top so it's actually both languages at once...how dodgy
,calmorn,2005-08-11T21:42Z,this movie has two sound tracks playing at once. if you play the movie in winamp it will just play the english sound track.
,LeSeul,2007-12-02T20:47Z,"Thanks! I have been looking for this for ages. Great rip!

If anyone is interested, I have removed the german dubbing. And will seed if the interest is there."
,LeSeul,2007-12-02T20:52Z,"Actually, its just as easy to tell how to remove it yourself.

1) Google VirtualDubMod and download.
2) Open the Avi with VirtualDubMod and click no to the improper encoding message.
3) Video>Direct Stream Copy
4) Streams>Stream List> Double click stream 2
5) File>Save as> a different name.

And Voila! German Free."

Multiple audio tracks is not a problem with new enough Divx codec. I have version 6.5.1 installed and by default it plays only the english audio track (but if you want you can select the german track from divx menu that can be accessed from the divx icon in system tray)."
,guitars13,2009-01-07T06:27Z,Dude you rock! Thanks for LITERALLY walking me through step by step and getting rid of the German audio. I have NO idea what I just did but it worked! lol
