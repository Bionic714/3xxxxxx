Cedega 4.4 and Point2Play 2.0.2 for i386 in tgz format.

I downloaded this from http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3355627

For the first i just wanted the tgz files, second there was about 3 copies of everything so the size of everything was over 100MB.

Files included:

cedega-4.4_releasenotes.html
cedega_4.4-1.i386.tgz
Cedega_howto_4.3-1.1.1.1.txt
Point2Play-2.0.2_releasenotes.html
