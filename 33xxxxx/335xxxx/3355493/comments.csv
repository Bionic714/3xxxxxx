,Mr. Style,2005-07-16T05:41Z,"Hey, i downloaded it, used Win-RAR to unzip it and then burned the ISO to a DVD with Nero.
When I put it in my X-Box it says invalid media.  Did I do something wrong?"
,toolboxio,2005-07-16T22:59Z,"not likely, but you might have to repack the iso. use qwix or craxtion or cxboxtool."
,Illuminati_17,2005-07-17T21:25Z,"Great game!!

Thanks Bartan!"
,UFscotty2hot,2005-07-18T05:54Z,"It always hangs for me. It's not the media, either. I've burned a few games with the same media, and I've burned this twice. Same problem."

,jebedai,2005-07-20T04:07Z,@shady78 read some forums and check out websites. your post sounds too suspect
,notoaaz,2005-07-21T13:09Z,"I have downloaded this game twice and twice i have ended up with an empty iso file, I have tried C-Box-Tool and Craxtion along with ISObuster and all of them show nothing is actually in the file, also i tried to burn it using nero and my xbox just says its an unknown media can anyone help me???"
,Cabalistik,2005-07-31T10:40Z,For some reason WinRar tells the file is corrupt... is there a solution for this? Thanks
,Kinno,2005-08-01T16:55Z,"okej i had problems extracting/transferring directly from the ISO.. Solution:: Download the program ""qwix"" (A Xbox ISO managing program), can be found on: http://www.x-b-o-x.net/modules/mydownloads/viewcat.php?cid=89
(Must be registered to be able to download)

Load up the ISO in that program, extract to local harddrive and it should work (Worked fine here, did not with other programs)

Did not try to extract on the fly directly from ISO to Xbox but it should work if it worked with extraction to local drive.

kkthx bye :)"
,Kinno,2005-08-01T16:58Z,"update::
QWIX can found here directly (v.1.01 latest version)
