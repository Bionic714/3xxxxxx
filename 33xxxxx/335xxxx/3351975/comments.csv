been looking for a bin/cue version."
,Reqruiem,2005-07-04T05:07Z,Thank you.
,Kornelius,2005-07-04T21:44Z,there is a 51 mb version that works with XP i think.. .rar though..
,prunehead,2005-07-06T00:04Z,"Just to clarify something here about XP compatibility.

The game does run under XP BUT the resolution won't go any higher than the default 320 X 200 without the game crashing on a Geforce card.

Sound card compatibility problems can occur too..."
,Rusty_Nails,2005-07-06T17:21Z,"A word of advice to everyone out there, if you all have the original cd OR if the Duke3d.grp comes along with this, all you need to do is to download the JonoF's port and you can play even with 3dbit textures and 3dmodels. There's an option that lets you play on classic mode too ofcourse (software) so the oldskool experience won't go at loss at all.

Consider it.. :)"

                             ³ATOMIC BONUSES!!³
                             ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

 Included on this CD-ROM are some special extras.  They are:

 1) Duke Nukem 3D Screen Saver and Entertainment Pack.  For Windows 3.1
    or higher, this pack includes several screen savers, sound clips, an
    image carousel, and much much more!

    TO INSTALL: Change to the goodiesscrnsavr directory on the CD-ROM,
                and enter SCRNSAVR.EXE.  Follow the onscreen help.

 2) Two Duke Nukem 3D Plus! Pack Themes.  Created specially for this CD,
    these themes will keep Duke around your computer even when you're
    doing that boring work stuff.  These themes require Windows95, and
    also require that you have installed MicroSoft's Plus Pack.

    TO INSTALL: Change to the goodiesthemes directory on the CD-ROM,
                and enter DNTHEMES.EXE.  Follow the onscreen help.

 3) Special Audio Track!  If you have an audio CD-ROM player, you can
    play Track #2 of this CD as music!  It's a specially recorded
    version of the Duke Nukem 3D Theme Song.  Be careful not to play
    Track 1 on your audio CD-Player, as that is computer data, and it
    can be harmful to your audio CD player to play computer data
    through it.  However, Track #2 is a special Duke Nukem 3D theme
    song that you can play over any audio CD player!

    There are plenty of other fun things in the goodies directory on
    your CD-ROM.  Make sure to explore it for more fun!

                             ³BONUS SHAREWARE!³
                             ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

 As an extra bonus, we've included shareware versions of some of the
 most popular games from both Apogee & 3D Realms Entertainment.

 To install these, you need to copy the files from the directory
 listed above into a directory on your hard drive.  Once there,
 type SETUP to configure the game, and then follow the instructions
 on screen for more information!  (Do not try and run them from the 
 CD-ROM, it will cause problems)

 These games are:

 1) Death Rally                   (found in sharerally on the CD)
 2) Xenophage: Alien Bloodsport   (found in sharexeno on the CD)
 3) Raptor: Call of the Shadows   (found in shareraptor on the CD)
 4) Terminal Velocity             (found in sharetv on the CD)
 5) Rise of the Triad             (found in sharerott on the CD)

 NOTE: Do not copy these files with Windows File Manager, as you may
       have problems running them afterwards if you do."
,Galeriel,2006-05-01T11:15Z,"Please, seed..."
,Nerd42,2007-09-11T17:49Z,"Yeah, please seed this. It isn't piracy since I used to own one of these CDs but it is now in multiple pieces in a landfill somewhere. I got the .rar version and that was OK until now when I'm trying to play on a Mac. It'll accept an Atomic Edition CD but won't take just the .GRP files.

The whole point of this is to get it to run the awesome mods Duke it Out in DC and Life's a Beach - they aren't included in this release but EVERYBODY SHOULD GET THEM CAUSE THEY ROCK!"
,Randal2,2008-02-16T19:12Z,nice but are u gonna seed?
,bookworm1960,2011-08-11T02:11Z,"Great game, thank you!"
