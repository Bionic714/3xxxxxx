1971 French lp. Add Camembert Gong line up as backing, add a splash of William Burroughs & you have a rare lp. Also has Gong's set from Greasy Truckers as a bonus. If you like Camembert/Continental Circus you'll love this. Full art inc from Guthlac2. Hope this uploads ok. Been having probs with this site recently.
