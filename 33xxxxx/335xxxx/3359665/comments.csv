,lilxballinxboi,2005-07-22T22:18Z,Sorry guys this is my first upload so I don't know if I screwed something up. I'm limiting my upload to just 1 person so it can get done faster and hopefully he/she will help me seed. I'm only pushing out around 35-38 KB/s stupid adsl. I'll keep it on for as long as it takes.
