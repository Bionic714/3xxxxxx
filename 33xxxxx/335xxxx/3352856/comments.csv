,rangersfc,2005-07-06T19:44Z,Nah mate it appears to be a bad torrent.
,stoedbert,2005-07-07T11:05Z,Too bad... I really wanted this
,Kid33,2005-07-08T02:49Z,"This is one of my favorite games. I actually bought it and have the disk. If the torrent isn't working someone email me and tell me how to get the files from the disk and make them into a torrent so everyone can download them. I have alchohol 120, nero 6, and azureus but don't know what to do.

,daGnutt,2005-07-08T10:05Z,"Sorry for having this unaviable for so long, this is the first torrent i've created. But now it seems like it is uploading.

Hope you get it down..."
,Malvakten,2005-07-21T15:17Z,Whats the diffrent between this one and the one 1/8 of the size?
,daGnutt,2005-07-22T07:13Z,"This one has more distributers.
This is more or less the 1/8th, but unpacked, so that even after you have downloaded, and want to install and play the game, you are able to share it with the world without it taking you extra hdd (prolly therefore there are more distributers of the file)"
,Senapsburk,2006-02-02T09:13Z,"Checkout the game before downloading

So you dont get upset because of (old) graphic.

However its a playable game while downloading some new stuff since minimum system req. is: Pentium 90, 32 MB RAM

,xxpirateninjaxx,2008-01-20T17:20Z,"daGnutt - there is no tracker assigned for this file, or whatever - thats what is causing the problem with the ridiculously bad upload/download

i have 50kbs set aside for upload thats being wasted

that being said, i rather want this, so keep seeding for about 2 days, IMO"
