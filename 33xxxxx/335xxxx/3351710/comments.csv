,Pantomime-Reject,2008-10-13T03:40Z,"Hi, Thanks for putting up the Brass Band stuff, could you re-seed it for me?
You asked for others to put more stuff up so I've put up a torrent for some stuff by a Marching Band local to my town.
Torrent is here if you're interested http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4442230
Thanks again"
