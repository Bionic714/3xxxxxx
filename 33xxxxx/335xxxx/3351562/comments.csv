Well, I'll dig the music when I get it downloaded, but after reading the file list I can say in advance  this is a must have for any jazz collector,  indeed,  any possibility to get the covers as well ?

I would be VERY interested in receiving the CD inserts with the complete discographies.  In fact, ""VERY"" doesn't say it strong enough (I am quite meticulous in the construction of my mp3 library,  and those materials would save me SO much research time with regard to determining recording dates and such).

Thanks again!

P.S.  Any chance that you have Vols. 2 and 3 as well?  Not that I mean to be greedy...;-)"

Would greatly appreciate if someone can re-seed, but if not, I am glad to get the tracks I did.  Leaving the 86.8% available for anyone that wants to get a partial set."
,Bobben66,2006-04-28T17:52Z,Thanks so much for this compilation! I'm also stuck at 86.8 % so a re-seed from anyone whould be great.
