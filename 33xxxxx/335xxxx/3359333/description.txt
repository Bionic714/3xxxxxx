Hardrocking UK progressive blues from 1970 - 71. This is classic sixties rock & roll, featuring members of Uriah Heep, most notably Ken Hensley (who is a genius imho). This is a reissue of the two albums they made before splitting up. For some reason their records never sold too well, which has been blamed on their dramatic albumcovers - of all things. Those who know their rocknroll history will reckognise a lot of names involved with Toefat. Ken Hensley, Cliff Bennett,  Alan Kendall & Lee Kerslake to name a few. Observant listeners will reckognice a few tunes from Ken Hensleys other projects aswell.
