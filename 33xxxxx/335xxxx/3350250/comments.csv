,eez,2005-06-29T22:58Z,What is with all the releases for the same version?
,eez,2005-06-30T01:50Z,Ah.. I see. Nevermind.
,X,2005-06-30T03:18Z,"This version sucks !!!

Version 5.5 is the last that really works. Version 6 makes a fast computer slow or non-starting at all....

Beware of this - use 5.5 !!!"

This is a crap beta release that doesn't uninstall on it's own.. It can lock you out of your computer, hang applications that your running stop your e-mail from working and refuse internet explorer access to the net..
All of this and more happened to me.."
