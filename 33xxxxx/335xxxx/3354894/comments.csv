,Katronias,2005-07-12T04:55Z,Better to go to d-addicts and get all of them. Not a lot of poker though. Mostly melodrama.

,watwegsw,2005-07-15T13:44Z,"this is awesome, im currently on episode 10 and i love it! Its so well done, amazing actors, amazing script, amazing soundtrack! Its really an epic, we get to follow him from the very first years of his life. Damn i love it! People get this, im just telling you. Dont let ""drama"" get to you as a bad word, because then, you are really missing something. Asian dramas arent as western ones. "
