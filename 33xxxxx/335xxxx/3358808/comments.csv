,BeOSDano0,2007-10-11T04:29Z,"This is one of the ""must have"" UFO documentaries. The background behind the making of it is unusual, in that the US Air Force and the Pentagon were the ones who approached the producer to make it for them, and allowed unprecendented access to government personel during filming. There is a short clip at the end that supposedly is real footage of a UFO that landed at Holloman AFB in 1971. Google ""Holloman UFO"" for a most intriguing story!"

Audio: MP3 44.1kHz 2ch s16le 128kbps
Runtime: 1:30:07

Not the best quality but watchable. The video should have been deinterlaced and maybe deblocked before encoding (e.g., mencoder -vf pp=fd/ac). The audio has a constant and irritating noise at some frequencies above 8kHz that maybe should be been filtered out, but if your playback software includes an equalizer, the noise can be muted (e.g., mplayer -af equalizer=0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:-12:-12).

Thanks a lot! :)"
