,votemarvel,2005-07-11T18:22Z,"A lot of people are spamming links to sites that have nothing to do with this movie, bittorrent or The Pirate Bay.

They are doing it sloely for their own financial gain, either real money, online referals or game communities.

Even if they only get a hit every now they are still making money.

Spamming scum."
,marapasto,2005-07-11T20:05Z,La Pelicula Esta En Español O En Ingles Con Subtitulos???

Saludos"
,latinchulo,2005-07-11T20:48Z,yo lo que no entiendo porque ustedes le ponen TS-Screener a su peliculas. eso hace a la gente confuso.
,LiMiTeDiVx,2005-07-11T21:00Z,Pues se pone TS-Screener pq es un TS-Screener
,gungr,2005-07-11T21:15Z,"I assume that the movie is subbed in spanish, so here we go:

get the movies, but realease it unsubbed.
Much more people would appreciate it.
After you guys had it realeased it plz sub it on what god damn language you want.
Plus that it takes more time to get the movies released if you sub it.

cincerly 
gungr that dont download subbed shit."
,Normy,2005-07-11T23:24Z,"Varför måste dom dubba filmerna, får ju lära sig engelska eller ha den textad istället. Hoppas vi får en engelsk snart."
,igard,2005-07-11T23:57Z,gayass spain with their gayass dubbing
,latinchulo,2005-07-12T01:54Z,"disculpa mi ignorancia limitedivx pero Ustedes son las unicas personas que le ponen TS-screener a sus peliculas. Pero como puede ser Telesync y Screener a la misma vez?

Por favor aclarame."
,kom4nche,2005-07-12T01:55Z,"the spanish scene have a different form to write the quality of the releases, I will explain a little to all of you can understand it.

They use the first part to say the video quality and the second part to say de audio quality. So, when they say ""TS-Screener"", you have to understand that the video have the quality of a TELESYNC video, and the audio have the quality of a screener audio (screener for the spanish scene is a CAM, so the audio have CAM quality).

Other is the spanish ""DVD-Screener"", thats mean the video source is a retail DVD, and the audio source is an audio recorded on a cinema, CAM audio again.

thats it"
,latinchulo,2005-07-12T02:24Z,Thank you kom4nche for making that clear.
,kom4nche,2005-07-12T06:46Z,"la scene española tiene otra forma de nombrar la calidad de los releases, usan la primera parte para decir la calidad del video y la segunda parte para la calidad del audio. Cuando dicen ""TS-Screener"" significa que el video tiene calidad de un video TELESYNC y el audio tiene calidad de audio SCREENER, lo que es un audio grabado de cine."

Please watch your language. 

Do all European people have to curse all the time?
Maybe this site should only be in Chinese because this language is far more common than English. "
,Chimairo,2005-07-18T03:19Z,It's a shame that it is in spanish. they should really learn to use subtitles instead. Movies should be watched with the original language! indeed! ..what a waste.
