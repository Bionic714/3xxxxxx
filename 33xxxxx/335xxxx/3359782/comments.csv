,samuraimoppi,2006-01-05T22:29Z,Seed man!See the downloads!??where are the seaders?!?!?!?
,skippysweet,2006-07-03T19:25Z,"Thanks so much, downloading now, 150kb/ps and climbing."
,Otech,2006-08-17T23:19Z,"Whazzup, looks like people are seeding, but nothing happens...??"
,Sarre,2006-08-19T20:38Z,"As of writing there's 28 seeds and 75 peers, and everything is running smoothly."
,x_ile,2007-11-12T00:43Z,"I know it's oooold, but please seed this bitch.

Anyone have a link to an active season 2 torrent (or at least ep 6 (Jail))?

I'll seed any 30 Days torrent till I hit 3:1 (at least) if I can ever get a full dl."
,x_ile,2007-11-14T20:04Z,"Finished the dl. Seeding now and will be for a while. Good quality, but ep 06 cuts 1-2 mins short (mostly preview/credits).

I don't like ""reality"" TV, and didn't much like Spurlock's ""Supersize Me"", but this series is very good. S 01 Ep 01 (minimum wage) should be required viewing.

I found Season 2 (fulldlsDOTcom) and I'll be seeding that for a while, too. (Even though I'll be done watching ASAP!)"
,stefanmuc2k,2008-10-30T00:27Z,Season 2 is on torrentreactor dot net
,jkillah1,2008-11-03T02:47Z,"Was? WAS?  Ich verstanden Sie nicht! Ich spreche English. ENGLISH!

This is cool though, and I heard about this for the first time at http://www.atheistrev.com/2008/07/christian-extremist-on-30-days.html"
