,Bill_Door,2012-06-11T22:36Z,"So, I sit here, watching my client stopped at 65.9 %, and slowly but surely entering the counting up to the point where I have actually seeded more than I have downloaded. My only wish, is that some one may also seed, then allowing me to gain the remaining 34.1 %. Allowing me to then to continue seeding and get this collection to others on the internet."
