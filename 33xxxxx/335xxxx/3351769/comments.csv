,SysGhost,2007-04-25T21:14Z,"For those who wonder why the heck we need this. Simple:

Creative releases the drivers ONLY! on their website, not the applications such as AudoHQ (needed to manage the soundfonts) and other, sometimes needed softwares.

Creative simply require that you already have the applications installed from the original CD before you can update them.

I have lost this CD a long time ago... so without the CD I own a piece of hardware where the manufacturer cannot provite any softwares. In other words: ""Almost uselsess piece of hardware "". A simple soundcard and thats it!
No soundfont managing and such stuff, just a plain basic driver from their website.

So: No Installation CD means a plain soundcard with no extra functions at all! ...at least if it is manufactured by Creative."
