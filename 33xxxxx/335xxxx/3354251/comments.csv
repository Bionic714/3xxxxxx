,Hajime,2005-07-12T23:33Z,"I feel much.  I copied that information of this Link: 

http://www.dvdgo.com/product~catgid~0~list~0~prodid~1997~typeproduct~1~dvd~Manhattan.htm

One assumes that these languages and subtitles would have to come all, but for some strange reason to my DVD it needs things.  I bought it in a kiosk, and I am afraid that it was modified the original Spanish edition erasing some things for the kiosk distribution.  I hope that you pardon to me.  It is the first time that I commit an error doing an upload."
,Hajime,2005-07-12T23:35Z,This is a nuke. There are only avalaible SPANISH subs and ENGLISH and SPANISH subs. Can some admin change the info?

,jungleboogie,2008-04-26T22:47Z,"OK, I rescind my previous thanks. I get an error message from Nero when trying to burn this fucker off. 

A word of advice: Take the time to make sure your files are in order before uploading."
