,qoojiao,2005-07-13T06:14Z,does the windows update function work on this?
,vic113,2005-07-19T03:43Z,"I have tried to upgrade from win 98se, but keep getting error messages that files will not copy from setup disk to c: drive. I was wondering if this is disabled by you? Is clean install only method I can use?"
,Omega0980,2005-07-20T18:11Z,Can i upgrade from Windows 98SE with this?
,Omega0980,2005-07-20T20:54Z,shall i burn it on Nero like an .ISO file?
,nachoguy50,2005-07-21T07:09Z,"Yes you can burn it nero.  Yes you can upgrade from win98.  If its giving you errors then you might have to do a clean install, but i dont think its required.

and yes the windows update function will work.  you need to use one of the provided serials to install, then after its installed you use the key changer to change it, then you will be allowed to update."

,popz,2005-08-15T18:00Z,Is the serial still valid? Can I use it and install SP2?
,nachoguy50,2005-08-17T04:07Z,"yes and yes.  you gotta use the serial to install it, then after its installed you change the serial with the provided program.  then you can update all you want."
,gorodaimon,2006-12-20T11:39Z,"Is it possible to anyone here re-seed this file?
I need a WinXP without SP to make a custom one using nLite + RyanVM's WinXP Post-SP2 Update Pack.
