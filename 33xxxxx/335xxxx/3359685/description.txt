Album Info

Joe Henderson- In N&#65533; Out (RVG Edition)

Every single album produced by the team of Joe Henderson and Kenny Dorham has become a Blue Note classic. &#65533;In &#65533;N Out&#65533;, propelled by the rhythm section of McCoy Tyner, Richard Davis and Elvin Jones is particularly memorable for Henderson&#65533;s &#65533;Punjab&#65533; and &#65533;Serenity&#65533;, both of which have become jazz standards. An alternate take of the title tune has been added to the album.

" Reviewer: Jazzman from San Marcos, Ca. USA
I always thought Joe Henderson's "Mode for Joe" could never be topped, but this new release from Blue Note kicked that notion in the gutter. This thing is collossal and a mind destroyer. "In n' Out" is easily Joe Henderson's very best session, including "Inner Urge", "Joe's Mode", and "The Real McCoy" with McCoy Tyner. It just cooks and cooks and cooks and keeps on cooking. The first track is the best track ever recorded, but it keeps getting better. Try to keep from wetting your pants. This ranks up there with "Sonny's Crib", "Kind of Blue", Adam's Apple" and "Blue Train". Once in a blue moon, a certain combination of players come in contact with the right record producer and the right material, and a miracle is made. This is such a miracle. Joe is the very best tenor sax player who ever walked the earth, and this is the best music ever recorded. That's the God's honest truth. Prove me wrong. 5000 Chalupas. This is better than Point of Departure, Sonny's Crib, and Kind of Blue all put together."
