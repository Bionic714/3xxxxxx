,tagfat,2005-07-03T21:58Z,"Im so sorry.  I discovered at some point yesterday evening that there was a problem as my BT-client said health 99% for the torrent. 
I didnt know if this would pose a problem for dl's but obviously it has. 
I will re-up and hopefully avoid the trouble. 
I have been reading up on the matter and Im stil confused: It was not a matter of a windows thumb-file and neither the old DMZ problem. "
