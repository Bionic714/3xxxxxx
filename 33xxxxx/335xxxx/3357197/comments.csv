,shady78,2005-07-20T20:28Z,try burning to disc then put disc in xbox then reboot xbox so it loads straight from the disc and not the dashboard this has happened to me a couple of times for other games and this usually fixes it if anybody else has any ideas im more than welcome to listen

,bigfitswell,2008-01-18T08:45Z,I tried playing this in my 360 & a message pops up saying that this game is from a different region. Any ideas. Are your other games NTSC also.
,darkstar0422,2008-03-01T22:48Z,"I have an NTSC 360 and i used nero to burn the iso to a cd, but it still says i have the wrong region code, any ideas?"
,doolcan,2008-06-19T23:24Z,"I had the same problem as a lot of you.  The game wouldn't play from the harddrive.  I used gxiso to extract and ftp it to the hd, and wasn't able to run it. 
I extracted it manually with xiso and ftp'd it to my f drive.  I renamed the folder Marvel and it worked fine after that.  Hope this helps any of you that are having trouble."
