This very professional group formed in Genova in 1971 as a trio consisting of bass, guitar and drums. After releasing two singles in 1971 and 1972 the trio recorded the LP Arrow Head in 1972, which displays their great talent, in particular the one of bass player Bob Callero. The style is hard-progressive-rock of the very fine kind and its album can be considered as one of the foundation albums of Italian rock music today, and as one of the best, too. The lyrics are rather interesting and very well integrated in their musicÂ´s style and sound.
