Reason is the best software to create music!"
,eggewert2,2005-07-12T12:22Z,No it isn't but it's good for non-vocal electropop.
,albazone,2005-07-12T20:18Z,"Actually I've created music with vocals in Reason.
You sound like a newbie to me :/"
,TekHousE,2005-07-13T17:05Z,"hehe @ Albazone..

I have used vocals in Reason as well.."
,The Omen,2005-07-14T19:06Z,"Reason is the shit, but.... ""the best software to create music.."" I don't think so.. That would be Reaktor if you know your way around it, but even Reaktor has its problems. The sound of Reason is still not quite there and needs some further processing. Other than that the program is hugely fun to play... oh thanx for the update m8."
,TekHousE,2005-07-17T20:27Z,no problemo :)
,HotDuCk,2005-07-18T00:34Z,Hey anyone did it yet??   I'm willing but not sure if it's necessary or whatever...           allready downloaded it ofcourse but not sure if I shall instal it :P          Reason is Nice
,TekHousE,2005-07-19T16:31Z,"I had updated my reason 3.0 BEFORE I uploaded the torrent mate! ;) It works 100%...

Considering the problems with 3.0 the update is probably a good idea for all users..

If you are not sure, set a RESTORE POINT BEFORE upgrading.."
,emelpee,2005-07-24T00:29Z,Bara jag som har fått problem med att exportera vissa projekt till wave? Det blir sånt äckligt digitalljud i wavefilen. Det började pga av denna uppdateringen. Någon som vet varför?
,emelpee,2005-07-24T01:24Z,"oh, in english :
After I installed this update I have some problems with exporting. There's some sort of digitalsound in the wavefile. Someone who knows why?"
,TekHousE,2005-07-28T17:52Z,"@emelpee,
what sort of noise? Is it popping or crackling etc.? And you are exporting to wav..or aif?

Make sure that you have set the resolution of the file to 44,100khz and 16 bit (CD sound quality settings) and then export ..                                     "
,Gorgmeister,2006-01-02T23:20Z,"Yeah, Reason is the best! This is really great, thanks! Does anybody have Propellerheads Recycle??? This is really important! If you know where to get it, tell me!"
,blaze7,2006-05-14T19:56Z,"Tracker is having problems or something, stopped at 78.1%. Speeds of 50KBs before, hopefully a few people will seed. "
,blaze7,2006-05-14T20:51Z,Leachers are uploading less than 1KB/s and severly slowing the torrent. Try upload at least 16-20KB/s or the seeders will doing all the work on their own.
,backgroundsounds,2006-05-30T06:27Z,"Nice seed Tekhouse. 
But does anyone know of ReCycle 2.1? or 2.0? I desperately need it. Ive got a big deadline! Please. Kudos to those that seed it!"

,Plisken,2007-06-14T13:13Z,"emelpee,

""Fixes in Reason 3.0.4
These are the issues that were fixed in the 3.0.4 update:

Export as audio file
There was an issue in Reason 3.0.3 (on Windows) that could cause weird sounds when exporting a song or loop to an audio file. This was most likely to appear when using certain Scream settings. This happened only when exporting audio as everything sounded fine when listening to Reason directly or running Reason in a ReWire host. This has now been fixed."""
