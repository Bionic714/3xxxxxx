I assume this is how rock-music sounds in China. I'm sorry that I couldn't get a more detailed info on this "Daolang", the only two words in english on the CD is "Daolang" and "2002" - so I assume that the CD was made in 2002.

When I asked about "good rock music" in a music store during my time in Beijing, one guy said that "Daolang is good rock". And it is. It's actually closer to, for example, U2, so don't expect anything like Rammstein.
