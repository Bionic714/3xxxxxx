,boSTREAM,2005-07-24T14:46Z,"I've got some more... in fact, I think I've got the most of them..."
,boSTREAM,2005-07-24T22:19Z,"If you want more Marx, name the movie in this forum, and I will see if I have it..."
,RH66,2005-07-25T03:40Z,"Tackar så hjärtligt för denna, boSTREAM. Det finns ju 12 Marx Bros.-filmer till och med risk för att låta giriga, vilket vi naturligtvis INTE är, så ser vi fram emot att du lägger ut så många av de här klassikerna som du har, orkar, kan och vill..."
[T],TheTeaher,2005-07-25T10:54Z,"WooW!

I am very very thankful, please give us more!!
I remember they made a movie called A day at the race or something like that. Do you have that one?"
,boSTREAM,2005-07-25T14:17Z,"I've got these with swe subs: A day at the races, A night at the opera, A night in Casablanca and The big store. Without swe subs: Duck soup, Horse feathers, Monkey buisness, Animal crackers, The cocoanuts and the Bonus disc for that box (Silver screen collection. I can start with A day at the races, because I saw that someone wanted it!"
,snowman77,2005-07-26T15:04Z,Kan du inte lägga upp The Big Store sen! Tack på förhand!

,ryan1810,2006-01-22T03:40Z,I'm stuck at 66.4% and been doing this for a week. If you could please seed for a day or two. That would be a great help
,ryan1810,2006-01-30T12:40Z,"Thanks so much, great movie. Took a while to complete but well worth it"
,woltsu,2006-07-02T11:34Z," Can anyone seed please....stops in 98,5% :("
,woltsu,2006-07-03T11:53Z,"Still 98,5%.....seed please!"

,IgnatiusD,2006-07-21T04:52Z,Someone PLEASE seed this!!!
,IgnatiusD,2006-07-22T23:27Z,"Many people are stuck at 99%! If someone could seed for just a couple of minutes, it would be greatly appreciated."
,Rheya,2006-11-23T20:08Z,"It is a shame that noone is seeding tha Marx movies. These are same of the most brilliant movies ever made. However, boundless amounts of CRAP is available on this site, with dozens of seeders on one movie in many cases."
,baroon,2007-07-09T16:02Z,"Please seed,I´m stuck for a long time now!!!"
,EliteBubba,2007-09-03T23:08Z,Doesn't seem like any seeders are gonna come along. I'm considering just deleting the 99.9% I've gotten. A damn shame after uploading over 40gb...
,floppyjoe,2007-11-25T19:08Z,"Please, Can anyone seed this one?
