,battleangel,2005-07-03T15:38Z,"I appreciate anything you can do!

So far I have episodes 1-10 and 18-20. So with this completed I only miss 12-17. Which is also where most people are missing files.

I don't understand why this is so difficult to get hold of. One possibility is that one of the archives for episode 17 were damaged, at least the one I got from Torrentbytes had this problem. And people do love the season packs so I reckon many have held off. A quick way to check episode 17 would be to play the file around 7min 53s and see if there are any glitches."
