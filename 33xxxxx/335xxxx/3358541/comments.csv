,rendezvous,2005-07-22T13:50Z,"While I appreciate the effort, this release totally hosed my Xbox. Although you claim otherwise, NO skin was included, also no XboxMediaCenter.xml either. Inspite of trying to install the skin and missing files, XBMC will not start. Will continue to use the [Y] releases from now on, he's always been 100%."
,MonkeyPuss,2005-07-22T16:38Z,"vad gör jag för fel?
xbmc startar men jag kan inte styra. bara reseta med handkontrollen..
(har raderat 0face008 katalogerna)
Hjälp..."

Do you really think this release doesnt work for the other 1434 ppl that leeched it - without even one of them asking why it is incomplete ?
While I would never claim that i always work without errors, these releases are ofcoz tested by me and are fully working.
I dont know what went wrong on your side, coz u donot explain what exactly happened.
If there is stuff missing from the release the only thing that comes to my mind is that either your files are corrupt or you are using a WINRAR that is too old. That could cause such errors.
And please, try to think about what you CLAIM to be FACT. If there are problems you could even just ask for help here. PPL normally are really helpful around here.

Erm...
Could you try that in English again, so that everyone can understand, and maybe even help you ;-)"
,MonkeyPuss,2005-07-22T21:32Z,"sry.. (everybody should learn swedish) ;)
My problem is that the controls didnt work att all when I've installed it. I found this thread about it but I still dont understand what I got to do to get it to work.

I hope U can help me..

Tnx in advance. (forgive me / bad English)"
,GasGiver4711,2005-07-22T23:12Z,"@MonkeyPuss
The thread just describes problems and solutions while compiling. This wont be of any help to you, im sorry.
You should delete the entire xbmc directory, delete E:TDATA face008 and E:UDATA face008 directories. If you get the xbmc to work with controls then, plz delete your old profile if there is one left, and load the defaults from within xbmc.
Tell us if this helps."
,MonkeyPuss,2005-07-23T12:40Z,"nevermind.. MonkeyPuss made a stupid mistake.
Forgot to replace default.xbe in C: (useing xbmc as dash)

The release works perfect. 

Only thing that is missing is that swe letters åäö isnt working in the rss feed.

,Bruket,2005-07-23T20:58Z,"MonkeyPuss - Hos mig fungerar åäö på rss feed (bla. svt.se). Har installerat  20.07.2005.XBMC. XBOX.MediaCenter. 1.1.0.GasGiver !! 

Mycket skumt..."
,kazuyalee,2005-07-25T00:48Z,"Does anyone know how to get ac3 codecs to work in XBMC? I have one movie and the sounds are ac3 and I cant hear a thing, only see picture.. =("
,vking,2005-07-26T08:34Z,"GasGiver u rock, keep it up :)"
,sotu,2005-07-26T10:00Z,"Gasgiver thanks for such a great realease.  This is FAR superior to the Pimped XBMC I had before and is VERY stable and hasn't frozen or crashed yet.

thanks again"
,GasGiver4711,2005-07-27T00:52Z,"THX for the flowers ;-)       But plz don´t forget - All the real work is solely done by the developers !!!    So go and praise them on the www.xboxmediacenter.de Forums !     All i do is collect some stuff, sort some things out, compile and put it all together in a release ..."
