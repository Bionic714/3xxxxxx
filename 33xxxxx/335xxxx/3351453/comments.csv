They were undone, destroyed after all of man's weapons and devices had failed, by the tiniest creatures that God in his wisdom put upon this earth.

,Jammer_2005,2005-07-04T07:00Z,"Wow, things sure changed quickly on this torrent! Within a few hours we have gone from 8 seeders to 428!! - Say, would somebody be so kind as to advise what the common terms like ""POT"" (no idea), ""TS"" (I think I know this one, but ' not sure) and the other common terms here stand for?

,coolaidman,2005-07-04T07:17Z,"POT-Release group ""Pirates of the Theater""

CAM - This type of VCD was recorded by someone in a cinema with a camcorder. The picture quality and sound varies from OK to poor.

Telesync (TS) - Also recorded in a cinema but usually with a high-end camera and a separate audio source; These are generally decent to good quality.

Telecine (TC) - Done a number of ways, all from taking directly from the reel. Ripped in either widescreen (letterbox) or in full-screen (pan and scan) with excellent audio and video. The most common way is to get a device that you attach to the reel that generates a VHS tape of the reel. (called a telecine machine, but there are other machines that generate a digital output of both audio and video that are then put into a VCR, laptop or pc, and made into a VCD).

Screener - A Screener is usually recorded from a promotional video tape or DVD which is sent to censors and film critics etc.. The quality is usually as good as a commercial product, some times a copyright message appears on the screen.

Work-Print - Each frame of the film is copied from celluloid (or another source), these are sometimes incomplete movies. The sound is usually perfect and the visual quality can vary.

LD/DVDRip - VCDs with this on the cover are ripped from DVD or Laserdisc versions of the film and the quality is as good as genuine VCDs. "

,coolaidman,2005-07-04T07:34Z,shut the fuk up dude u were blaming hte encoder aka shadow for cutting off the last 10-15 sec of the audio its not his fault so shut the fuk up if u dont know wut ur talking about and the one ur recomending people to go get is the nuked version why the fuk would we want that when we got this piece here WAY better quality if we wanted shit we go running to the nuked version were here because this is the best there is so fuk off bitch
,EmesiS,2005-07-04T09:31Z,That is strange I only posted that comment once and it repeated. There is something wrong with this comment section because I noticed that it happens a lot and I thought it was the users just double posting by mistake. If I could delete the second one I would but I have no control. Sorry for the double post but I didn't do it!

,caligoinis,2005-07-04T16:00Z,"EmesiS, the double posting occurs when you have posted a comment and then press the reload button, since the webpage contains postdata it gets posted again and you basically send the same post once more. At least that's what I believe to be the cause : /
You need to browse back to the torrent again(not using back/foward-buttons either) after you've posted if you are to reload the page in wait for replies."

BITLORD IS E V I L!!!!
EVIL i say!!!"
,Skiddypants,2005-07-06T19:22Z,"My video is all screwed, what do I need to install to view this film?"
,TUSSFC,2005-07-06T19:35Z,"PhaZEtwO™ - I'm with you on this. 

Some people are unbelievable on this site and on torrent spy. I prefer registration only sites where people are much more polite and grateful.

People might want to remember that if you go and see this in the cinema you'll more than likely have someone sat near you who coughs every now and then. You KNOW that a CAM is going to be done in a cinema and there WILL be background noise. Get over it and shut up."
,TUSSFC,2005-07-06T19:35Z,Oh and ditch BitLord. You can't beat Azureus IMO.
,PhaZEtwO™,2005-07-06T20:20Z,"TUSSFC..
best ive found so far is BITcomet0.59 I tried Azureus but found its bit of a resource hog but thts just my opinion.
and tussfc.. you got any registration torrent sites you can recommend?"
,Jammer_2005,2005-07-06T21:22Z,"For the record, I have no problem with free downloads of popular movies, and Im not picky about quality... Heck, I praised the nuked version of this movie!- then I got flamed many times for saying that I liked it. What Im talking about here is FAR from the typical cam-recorded movie quality- My download was totaly unwatchable due to extremely messed up video- it looked real good in spots, then every few seconds the video showed huge block shaped images.. The video got so distorted that it was totally unwatchable in many spots. On my computer the nuked version was very watchable, and I did praise the nuked version in the comments. So, please dont mistake me for a person that expects dvd quality from a cam shot, I dont. I really think either my download got corupted, or perhaps my computer is too slow to play this correctly- although other files of this type can be played with no problems. Did anyone else find that the nuked version looked better than this one? Im just trying to figure out if my file got corupted, or what. I already deleted this download because the video looked like a scrambled pay tv channel in spots."
,Mr.Enrico,2005-07-06T22:59Z,"Why is the download going so deam slooooooooooooooooow...
5kb/s is noot much
Could anyone tell me why??"
,Mr.Enrico,2005-07-06T23:05Z,"And now its not downloading at all!!

,markoramius,2005-07-07T01:47Z,"Helt OK kvalitet egentlig. Har sett mye, mye bedre, men hva kan man vente når den akkurat har kommet på kino... Eneste som ødela for meg, var at lyden helt på slutten var borte..."
,Jonii,2005-07-07T13:15Z,SKITBRA FILM!!!
,mufty,2005-07-07T21:51Z,"Ljudet dör ju i slutet ju, vad säger rösten? Jag fattade ingenting av denna filmen. Lätt en av Spilbergs sämsta ever!"
,sherko,2005-07-07T23:08Z,"Eyy everyone dont download this crap its bad quality.....dont donwload i say it because its true

,shad0w1320,2005-07-08T02:38Z,"excuse me, sherko... i think if you look 2 comments down you will see that this release has been beaten by the new TC... this copy was the best on the net AT THE TIME OF UPLOAD... read before you speak, you inconsiderate son of a bitch"
,Nite Dawg,2005-07-08T06:06Z,Tom Cruise sucks! Discuss...
,Jammer_2005,2005-07-08T07:15Z,Rumor has it another version has much better quality (based on coments) than this one: http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3353347

http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3353347"
,DazedAndConfused,2005-07-08T16:39Z,"Well said PhaZEtwO™, you hit the nail right on the head. As the for torrent, its very good quality for a TS, very watchable. The only negative thing come with the nature of the release as a TS's, a bit of crowd noise and a such, but a very good release IMO."
,xlioilx,2005-07-09T03:09Z,"WTF at end Cuts off to soon I think, announcer says 
""on the moment the envaders arived breathed are air and ate are food they were doomed""

Or somthing close to that.
Is this the entire end comments ? 
Can someone post the rest of what the announcer is trying to say? I don't want to wast bandwidth on downloading a diffrent version of this.
was good movie"
,shad0w1320,2005-07-09T04:52Z,"xlioilx: if you download the original OST, track 14, ""reunion"", has the full ending monolouge by morgan freeman."
,fienx,2005-07-09T05:28Z,"Don't download this version!!! There is a much better one here. Look for the DivX one, way better!!"
,expresh,2005-07-09T05:32Z,This version has horrible quality.. many dark scenes you can't even see!!! the DivX is better quality
,bigfatsmoke,2005-07-09T11:13Z,Quality of this one stinks.  Sounds like someone scratching their bollox for 80 mins.
,Mcat,2005-07-10T01:26Z,Here Here PhaZEtwO™ I know exactly where you're coming from !  These Rude Little Dweeebs !   Grrrrrr.
,switchin,2005-07-10T15:43Z,"Don't Know As Of Yet, As I am Downloading It Now..."
,Lee-bob,2005-07-10T20:27Z,"Ur a prick PhaZEtwO™, maybee the reason that we dont go out and buy these films is coz they r way 2 over priced by the greedy fat cats at the top, for 1 film it will cost £18 and cost only 2 pence to make, so when u say we should'nt download, u sud buy the films 4 us, or wont u stick ur word."
,H0zz,2005-07-10T22:28Z,"bigfatsmoke - You are so right, fucking piece of shit :D"
,yoryan,2005-07-12T12:33Z,Excellent best one out there
,bmcm,2005-07-20T18:36Z,"Quite good quality of sound and picture. Actually there is Russian text only at the beginning, besides the movie looks like an original English version. Thumb up!
(PO POLSKU: całkiem niezła jakość obrazu i dźwięku, rosyjski napis tylko w czołówce filmu, polecam!)"
