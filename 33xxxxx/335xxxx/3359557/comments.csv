,Jedrzej,2006-03-06T18:32Z,Seed plz i am on 60% :/
,senseilargo,2006-07-02T20:11Z,"Can someone please seed, theres about 10 of us trying to download this and we're all stuck at 99.4%!"
,Quarantine,2006-11-13T15:42Z,"Hey I'm confused, I installed the game and all - but the crack doesn't work, in fact - it seems like it is from a completely different game called ""Sagara Family"", any hints?"
,Cortax,2007-01-20T07:36Z,"I had this mentioned in an earlier comment but I think it dissapeared when the Piratebay servers went down. But yet, the crack is from the wrong game so check out the site gamecopyworld.com and you should find the right one. "
,R!ce,2007-04-17T05:26Z,"Please keep seeding, as soon as i finish downloading, i promise i will seed "
,robertoII,2008-02-07T14:32Z,how do i install this after downloading it? can someone please tell me?
,Cortax,2008-02-16T18:09Z,"Should be pretty straitforward how to install it, just burn it and put the cd in your drive and the install should come up by itself or mount it in deamon tools for the same result. 

If it dont come up, just check the cd/mounted image in your browser and you should find an exe file to start the setup with.

Just make sure you download the propper crack as I added in the wrong one when I made this torrent waaaay back."
,mahoaho,2008-07-26T04:36Z,"i keep getting stuck at 57% then it says to insert the game CD but when i press okay ( even after ive mounted both cds onto daemon tools) the popup box just keeps poping up.  
helpp!!!"
,Cortax,2008-08-21T01:51Z,"Wish I could help you friend, but it was ages since I seeded this torrent much less played the game. Even think I lost my hard copy of the game too .... so my advice is either to try to
1-Reinstall
2- If that dont work, try download it again if your copy is corrupt."
,NeoDarkKnight,2008-08-24T23:05Z,"Uhh... I can't get htis game to play. It told me to download and install Virtual-Mate, which I did, and now it's asking for the product key of the game before it lets me play!

Can anyone help? I waited two days for this damn torrent to finish ._."
[T],Hgames,2009-03-08T12:39Z,http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4755379/Figures_Of_Happiness This release does not pop up telling you the cd is not in the drive. I had this issue with a rip I did of my cd and had to redo the release. The new release works on Vista 64.
