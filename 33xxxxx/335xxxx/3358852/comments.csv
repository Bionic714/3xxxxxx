,dudleydoright,2008-03-08T14:34Z,Why are you such a jerk?
,brave-bcn,2008-04-17T21:33Z,bitrate???
,markerb,2008-05-20T19:58Z,"brave-bcn: You can easily calculate the bitrate from the size of a sound file.  I took one song, ""Same Old Blues""  It's 11 Mb, and from Amazon I see that it's a 8 minute and 15 second tune.  That's 11 Mb x 1024 Mb/Kb x 8 bits/Byte = 90112 bits long.  90112 bits divided by 495 seconds is 182 kbps.  See?

Now I'll download it and make sure I'm right!"
,markerb,2008-05-20T21:35Z,"Some bit rate examples:
461 Ocean Blvd - Let it Grow: 192 kbps
Slowhand - Cocaine: 320 kbps"

,Feffe96,2008-11-17T22:04Z,clapton is a damn god I love him
,lemon1221,2008-12-17T10:57Z,"seeders are people who you are downloading from, the more the better. but then again you can have 40 seeders giving you 1 kb/s, and then the odd 1 that kicks out 100 kb/s

leechers are i think just the ones that take it without uploading it in turn"
,dedutch,2009-07-11T00:09Z,good torrent man! thank you very much for the upload! very nice clapton collection :-)

,Poe6661,2010-10-06T05:35Z,"This is one great torrent, thanks for the upload. However, it's sadly missing a couple of albums. ""Layla and other Assorted Love Songs"" a MUST, and Clapton Unplugged."
,dgs2004,2010-12-01T17:44Z,There are way to many files missing in this torrent. So I guess it is determied that you are a jerk and have no f'ing idea what the hell you are doing. Take care.
,J.Hering,2010-12-05T16:00Z,Could someone please make a list of what's actually included?
,chris1108,2011-04-11T15:16Z,"Thanks so much!!! I haven't downloaded the whole thing yet. Though if it doesn't include Layla and other Love Songs - as Poe6661 mentions - then that's a MUST. Just look for it elsewhere ppl, I downloaded a good copy of it recently. Can't wait to start listening to all of these albums! :)"
