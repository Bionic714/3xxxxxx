,Laurens7,2005-06-30T16:33Z,Is this the expansion pack or just a mappack
,anamorph2k4,2005-06-30T16:43Z,"No this is not the whole mappack.
Only the 5 new maps . I downloaded this myself @ xbox-sky (thanx sky) and wrapped it up to easy to burn ISO format.
The whole MapPack will include 9 maps and all patches released by this time.

,pringlet,2005-06-30T16:49Z,RiGHT oN! thankz
,anamorph2k4,2005-06-30T17:32Z,by the way...while installing u might think your box is frozen or stuck or what ever. Just be a little patient after a short while youll see a kind of strange progress bar for about 1 minute. Till the installation is done dont reboot ur box.
,NeoTechni,2005-06-30T18:38Z,Does it install on unmodded xboxen?
,anamorph2k4,2005-06-30T18:42Z,"No it wont...
but honestly, tell me how u want to run a burned disk or transfer files via ftp without modding or at least soft modding ur console?
Go to a friend with XBOX-Live Account and download them via Live!
"
,NeoTechni,2005-06-30T18:44Z,"How would I go abouts soft modding then?
I have an Action Replay/Memory Card drive for PC."

,BinaryMod,2005-06-30T20:49Z,"if you have nothing to do while downloading this... please increase your upload rate so we all dont have to sit there and watch it download for 4 hours .... im almost done, I'll leave min open with a max upload for a while"
,cyclonebee,2005-06-30T22:50Z,And im stumped on how do install this...help?
,rhoxnut,2005-07-01T00:17Z,"to install this, either ISO it and burn to disc, or FTP it to your xbox and run from there... READ THE NFO.. install the autoupdate first, unless you already have it by downloading from live or the previous AWSK map installer... and NeoTechni, check out www.xbox-scene.com for high quality information on xbox modifications."
,disbthai,2005-07-01T00:48Z,this can only be done on modded xbox right?
,xboxgrampa,2005-07-01T06:12Z,"modded xbox yes, do some research NOOBS.
my question (making me a noob to someone else, I guess) is if playing these maps on xbox live after they are released will get me banned?  I'm sure someone tried with the last two mappacks."
,anamorph2k4,2005-07-01T13:22Z,yeah you are right . I just wrote down the filenames not knowing how the maps are called in-game. Sorry for that. After all another torrent is up icluding all other 4 maps + auto updates. Nice! but unnessasary if u already got auto-update 1+1.1 and the already released 4 maps.
,the1maxim,2005-07-01T18:16Z,"Install Instructions:

1. Either Burn the ISO or send it to your xbox harddrive

2. If You Have The Newest Updates From XBOX Live For Halo 2, Skip To #7

3. Launch The Halo 2 DLC Installer, and pick AutoUpdate, when it finishes copying
Restart the XBOX and FTP In

4. Browse to /E:/TDATA/4d530064/$C/

5. MOVE the /E/TDATA/4d530064/$C/4d53006400UPDATE/ Directory To /E/TDATA/4d530064/

6. RENAME The /E/TDATA/4d530064/4d53006400UPDATE/ Directory To /E/TDATA/4d530064/$u

7. Load The Installer, And Install The 3 Map Packs, When That Is Done, Load The Game

8. If the maps don't show when you browse them in the game, FTP back in to /E/TDATA/4d530064/$C and copy Default.xbe, downloader.xbe and ContentMeta.xbe to the main directory of the game......worked for me."
,the1maxim,2005-07-01T18:40Z,"There are 9 maps in this release, just to clarify it for you all!"
,matadar,2005-07-02T19:03Z,"If I download this maps and install them in my Xbox with the autoinstaller, when I go in Live should I be banned from Micro$oft?
Please answer me if you have tested this situation.
Thank you!"
,anamorph2k4,2005-07-03T13:55Z,"  Multiplayer Map Pack Early Adopters 

While the official release date for the Map Pack isn't until July 5th, apparently some retailers have started selling the disc early. Contrary to what you might have heard, players who purchase and play the new maps prior to next Tuesday WILL NOT be banned from Xbox Live. Enjoy.

i dont use live so i really dont know..."
,fcuker,2005-07-07T09:29Z,"Am I missing something?  I load this up with Qwix and it shows up in Slayer, but it loads up in PAL.  Please help!  TIA! =)"
,Tural,2005-07-09T17:23Z,"Someone mentioned the names of the maps ""dune.map"" and ""triplicate.map""

-

That is the name Bungie gave the maps, perhaps the planned name for them.  Just look at Ivory Tower, it's .map name is ""cyclotron.map""

Thats just the map names Bungie gave it"
,xFullmetalx,2005-07-11T07:42Z,"I FTP the iso file to my xbox hardrive, I try to open it, then it freezes for few secs and nothing happens.. any help here please?"
,fcuker,2005-07-11T07:50Z,"Is this NTSC or PAL?  

XFullmetalx:  try burning it to a CD using Nero or any iso burner and loading it up that way.  The XBox won't read .iso files as far as I know.  For that you have to unpack the iso first or get a program that unpacks and sends the file for you.  ie: Qwix for an Avalaunch Xbox"
