Review by Adam Greenberg 
This is the first compilation album from the Mambo Inn, London's pioneering world music club. At times the music is far-reaching in its coverage of areas of the world, although all tracks are made to be extremely danceable. There is a definite leaning toward the Latin sound (ahead of the current "Latin wave"), with a number of mambos and the like. Other common appearances are those from the newer sounds of Africa, such as Kanda Bongo Man, Tchando, and Sweet Talks. Those artists who wouldn't normally be considered as playing "dance music" have of course been mixed thoroughly by the club's DJs. The solemn grandeur that is Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was even remixed into a dance groove â€” and it works! Jazzers from the U.S. even show up to put out some straight funky party music (in Jimmy McGriff's case, the funk comes straight from Sly Stone) ready for easy digestion. As a final kicker, a gospel group straight out of Atlanta arrives to finish off the listener with a heavy dose of high-power vocals. Purists will of course scoff at the album, and rightly they should. This is blasphemy (actually possibly literal blasphemy in Khan's case) to the traditions; the catch here is that it's the hyperchanging world of synthesis between the dance floors of Europe and America and the traditions of the rest of the world. In this sense, Big Noise is a notable album, and for the listener who wants to dance, it is perfection.
