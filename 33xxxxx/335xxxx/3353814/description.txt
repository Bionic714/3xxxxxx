This basicly makes that 30 day trial for NOD32 last...oh...40,000 YEARS! It also changes the default update server to that of the eval signatures so you no longer need a password to update NOD32. Meaning, even your great, great, great, great, great, great, grand children will be able to use supported NOD32 versions for free. Granit, ESET doesn't move their eval sigs after we all freakin die.
