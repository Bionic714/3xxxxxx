 ""Any Swede as field to few various am partaking in orient Asia for that amuse themselves. Bump movie in DVD - qualitative. Really Bump!"" :)"
,kallekall,2005-07-05T23:55Z,"To bad you didn't like it. But the word ""Kul"" is ""Fun"" in english. ""Really Funny"" may be to exaggregate, but i thought it was at least a little fun to watch."
,liptonice,2005-07-06T01:38Z,Sorry i didnt mean to complain in any way - i just translated the swedish description with that freetranslation website since i didnt understand it and was curious and then posted it here because i thought the translation result is quite funny. ;)
,ocap,2005-07-06T22:19Z,"Im not sure i know what ""bump"" means, but that was exactly what it was suposed to be =)

An other part is on its way now (there are gonna be about 10-15)...

Dont have to high expectations.. but still.. it is funny!"
