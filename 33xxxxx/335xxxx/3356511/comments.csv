And I forgot to put ""Enjoy!"" at the end. ~_^."
,bobbydoo,2005-07-17T07:19Z,Excellent. Thanks a lot. The audio quality is fine. No problems at all. And it's a good book. I'd love to see more true crime audiobooks on Pirate Bay :)
,The_Student,2005-07-18T02:02Z,"No problem, and it's nice to hear that my experimenting with methods for the best sound is appreciated :) . (I rather enjoyed the book as well too; especially since it also has functional value)"
