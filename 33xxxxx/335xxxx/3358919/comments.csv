,arata75,2008-09-06T12:05Z,"I had a weird problem after downloading this... the file type was just ""file"" not .rar, so WinRAR's shell extension didn't give me the option to unrar it.

I fixed this by renaming the file ""E-Books - Writing novels and screenplays.7z"" and that let me uncompress it. So if anyone else has that problem, there's the solution."
,KrystoferRobin,2008-09-21T21:09Z,"Absolutely brilliant.  Excellent collection.. And to think, I was only looking for the course you've included, and isntead, I find this absolute gem.

Gurgel, I should think I would like very much to kiss you."
