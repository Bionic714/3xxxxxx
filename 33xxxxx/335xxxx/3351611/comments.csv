,zubutix,2005-07-10T06:05Z,Bush didnt give a fuck about UN and went to war... Isnt that extremely arrogant? He did what he felt like and no one can say shit about it. Hes a moron and more people need to see that. He has made the world more insecure now. way to go.
,rci,2005-07-24T06:42Z,of course stupid bush did not give a flying fuck about the united nations - because they are controlled by the same people. UN is a phoney shit that is build on an ancient slaughterhouse yes all that organization is ruled by satanists and they want 98% of human being DEAD
,gregorius,2005-07-26T20:08Z,98% is exaggerated...what's about 55%?
