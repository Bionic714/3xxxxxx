for those who installed the game but have the ''insert cd '' error when trying to play, I don't know if that will help but when you copy the crack (folder deviance/crack of this download) in the emplacement of the installed game (probably program files/call of duty)  Say yes to replace the file that is the same as the crack.  I don't know if this will help but maybe some you you don't replace it and it would be the problem.

,Raw_Rodrigo,2008-10-12T23:56Z,"Goddammit, everything has been working perfect until now. I successfully installed the game, that was easy, I just mounted CD 1, then CD 2, done. 

When I mount CD 1 to actually PLAY CoD, I get an error saying ""Please insert the correct CD-ROM, select OK and restart application""

What do I do to start the actual game up!?"
,xxblackice,2008-10-21T17:39Z,"Thank You so much SnipedSniper, I'm such a noob and tried everything besides mounting the first disc before installing. It works now."
,xxblackice,2008-10-21T19:56Z,"To everyone who has already installed the game but gets the ""Please Insert the correct CD-ROM error"" when you try to open single player, go to ""My Computer""  click on ""Program Files""  and open the Call of Duty folder. Now minimize that folder and open the other call of duty folder you used to install the game like the mounted file folder or whatever (if you have the CoD ISO mounted with daemon tools or if you burned it on a disc, just open ""My Computer"" and right click it and click ""Explore"" which will open the containing files in it). Then open the ""deviance"" folder(the top one most likely) and open the ""Crack"" folder. Now right click the ""codsp"" file and click ""Copy"" and then bring up the first folder I told you to open (the call of duty folder in the programs list) and paste file in that folder and replace it with the one that was already there. Now try to open the single player again and it should work. If not, well,,,???. Btw, Thanks for the Torrent Sapphire."
,don_master_01,2008-10-22T19:03Z,Tis fucking dont work with cd2
,nijicon,2009-03-17T01:35Z,ok this is crap.  i have tried mounting disc 2 with daemon tools and it still will not recognize the freaking disc wtf
,GeIveI2aL,2009-03-25T01:32Z,"Easy to do, follow these steps.

1. Download torrent (for all those non-geniouses)

2. Extract to location both disc 1 n 2 (seperate folders named Cod 1 or woteva)

3. From the extracted disk 1 location 'setup' call of duty.

4. When it then asks for disk 2, say cancel, abort install but KEEP files.

5. Copy from the extracted files from disk 2 
-> setup folder -> data -> main
all files in this directory (pak1 to pak4) 

Copy or move to the newly instally cod at c:\programns\call of duty\ main 
(with the rest of the pak files)

Shud be up n runnin now :D"
