,Scottymyth,2005-07-16T12:17Z,Seed Please!!!
,Ritsch,2005-07-16T12:17Z,"This is the last disc. This disc also show two short medleys with various artists (for example UB40, Andrea Bocelli and Angelique Kidjo/Peter Gabriel). "
,ZoE,2005-07-16T12:30Z,"seeding dvd 1-4 @ 130 kB/s each, and only waiting for this one :D"
,Ritsch,2005-07-16T12:32Z,I had problem with jerky picture in beginning of Part II of this disc (The Who). I fixed it but got another minor problem. It's one short failure and I blame the DVD-making software. Rest of the disc should be OK.
,Ritsch,2005-07-16T13:17Z,"Also minor sound problems in song by Keith Urban. Not so much I could do. Made new discs a couple of times but couldn't fix sound problems in beginning of Part II of this disc.  Original mpeg files play without problem, it's the process making DVD causing the sound problems."
,Ritsch,2005-07-16T13:36Z,"Thank you, Fatslags.

More info:

Also a fault in menu on this one, sorry. Made a extra chapter in performance by Paul McCartney (Get back). Strange, didn't notice until now. It's only 2 songs by him solo and 2 with other artists."
,jantje2,2005-07-16T13:56Z,"You're the greatest and punctual as promised there's number five 
THANK YOU"
,FatSlags,2005-07-16T15:25Z,Thanks for the 5 in your series of dvds   
,Ritsch,2005-07-16T15:54Z,"To make things clear, this is the songs by Paul McCartney (& friends): Get Back, Drive my car, Helter Skelter, Long and winding road and finally Hey Jude. Five songs as I wrote in first info."
,Ritsch,2005-07-16T22:03Z,Thank you for covers White Shadow! I must do my own versions of DVD-covers. I have a finished a cover for disc 1 and it's not so bad. 
,Ritsch,2005-07-16T22:30Z,"This afternoon I've tried to do a new disc 5 for fixing audio problems but no luck (could maybe seed another proper version). It's a thing with the DVD-making software. Sorry, no new version. Thanks for downloading this and the other discs. And thanks for making dvd-covers and writing positive comments! Go and buy retail copies and support Live 8. Make poverty history!

"
,Ritsch,2005-07-16T22:54Z,"These discs versus retail: I don't think retail show speeches and Live 8 messages. If you want them download my discs and keep. And buy retail, support Africa and poor countries. Of course you get better sound etc buying retail."
,betty,2005-07-16T23:10Z,"Thanks to Ritsch for the DVD-S from Live 8

/Betty"
,Ritsch,2005-07-16T23:29Z,I also noticed wrong path to DVD-cover by White Shadow. All you Pink Floyd fans: very good audio/video. Mpeg2 audio (224 kbps stereo 16 bits 44 khz) not processed after recording. Let me know if you want a DVD only with Pink Floyd.....I can seed after this disc 5.
,betty,2005-07-17T00:06Z,"Jupp thanks i want it 
Thanks again or tack if you are Swedish "
,andibi,2005-07-17T10:11Z,"Hi Ritcsh, welcome back and thanks for your last great effort doing live 8 disc 5. My wife and I here in Tokyo have really enjoyed watching all the discs (especially disc 3). And after reading through the comments, it is obvious that many many other people around the world are as appreciative as I am. Thank you, andibi ..."
,GaMerZ,2005-07-18T20:09Z,how many disc will there b?
,thirdeye,2005-07-21T12:03Z,wow... I'm amazed at how many people worship these space rockers known as pink floyd. I guess I will listen...
,Ritsch,2005-07-25T16:01Z,"DVD-covers made by ""Ritsch"" for all discs: http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3360901"
,the_seal,2005-07-26T00:47Z,"Thank you!!!
