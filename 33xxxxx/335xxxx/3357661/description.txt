Jaffa notes:

With the original Pogues lineup recently reunited, their entire back catalogue of studio albums has been digitally
remastered and reissued - with extra bonus tracks included on each album. JAFFA is quite pleased to be able to
bring you everything (of note) that this great band put down on record. Rum Sodomy & The Lash was originally issued
in 1985.


"I saw my task... was to capture them in their dilapidated glory before some more professional producer f√πked them up,"
Elvis Costello wrote of his role behind the controls for the Pogues' second album, Rum Sodomy & the Lash. One spin of the
album proves that Costello accomplished his mission; this album captures all the sweat, fire, and angry joy that was lost
in the thin, disembodied recording of the band's debut, and the Pogues sound stronger and tighter without losing a bit of
their edge in the process. Rum Sodomy & the Lash also found Shane MacGowan growing steadily as a songwriter; while the debut
had its moments, the blazing and bitter roar of the opening track, "The Sick Bed Of Cuchulainn," made it clear MacGowan had
fused the intelligent anger of punk and the sly storytelling of Irish folk as no one had before, and the rent boys' serenade
of "The Old Main Drag" and the dazzling, drunken character sketch of "A Pair of Brown Eyes" proved there were plenty of
directions where he could take his gifts. And like any good folk group, the Pogues also had a great ear for other people's songs.
Bassist Cait O'Riordan's haunting performance of "I'm a Man You Don't Meet Every Day" is simply superb (it must have especially
impressed Costello, who would later marry her), and while Shane MacGowan may not have written "Dirty Old Town" or "And the Band
Played Waltzing Matilda," his wrought, emotionally compelling vocals made them his from then on. Rum Sodomy & the Lash falls
just a bit short of being the Pogues best album, but was the first one to prove that they were a great band, and not just a great
idea for a band."  (AMG)

Group News: JAFFA is looking for: A few good men. Or women. You can probably guess what for.. You have
to be a totally hard-core bad-ass individual who's on irc 24/7, but at the same time we don't want uber-
serious, super-boring ones, nor opportunists, nor those who speak lies. Nor robinson-jerry. Also, you
have to be 18 years old minimum, and like Music a lot, and be familiar with, or at least have heard of,
bands/artists such as Ramones, Dropkick Murphys, or Flogging Molly. That's it. If you think you fit the bill,
all that's left to do is to somehow get in touch with the JAFFA Supreme Overmind. Someone you know may know
someone else who has in turn once spoken to someone that..etc, etc, etc.
