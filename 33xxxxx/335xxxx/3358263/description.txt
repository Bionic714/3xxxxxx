1977 64m. Jeanne Silver, a pretty amputee, appeared in men's magazines and on San Francisco burlesque stages. She had the lower part of her left leg removed when she was a child. The remaining stump, extending several inches below her knee, is little more than bone covered with flesh. Director Alex DeRenzy uses the pseudo- documentary format to display Silver's sexual habits. She fucks Amber Hunt during a threesome, impales two teenage students and even goes so far as to ram it up a homosexual's ass. Long regarded as one of the more bizarre films of the 1970's, Long Jeanne Silver fulfills all expectations for those seeking a "freak show" event!
