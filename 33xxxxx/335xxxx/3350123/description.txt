Brewster-Eccles-Spencer-Morley-Neeson)
Y'got a whiplash body
y'got a space age mind
y'r a wildcat honey
on a straight ace ride
You can count me in
on anything
Y'made a deal with the devil
with y'r rag doll eyes
y'got a switchblade ready
for the sacrifice
Just touch me once (break that fever)
touch me once (red back fever)
listen to y'r heartbeat
touch me now
Y'got a silent number
for a special price
y'hear the backdoor rumble
get y'r loaded dice
You can count me in
on anything
Just touch me once (red back fever)
listen to your heartbeat
