Probably the most humane element about Juntaro Yamanouchi's projects with The Gerogerigegege is that they are executed with finesse and grace that doesn't compromise the artist's ability in being straightforward. Most especially in this outing, Tokyo Anal Dynamite, which was, not surprisingly, also recorded live in 1987.

Around some time in 1986 Juntaro meets up with a fifty-something homosexual man only known by the name of "Gero-30", who later went on with the band to perform the almost one-of-a-kind "senzuri" (choreographed, or rather, improvised masturbation) onstage during shows. This more or less catapulted the band to underground cult status in Japan, or in the frontman's own self-proclamation, "Japanese ultra shit band".
