(excerpt)
" The History of Rock and Roll was immensely successful and broadcast by stations all over the world. As late as 1981, the program (with an additional 2 hours added to the original 50) was still available. For all I know, it's available today, though I don't know who actually owns the rights other than The History of Rock and Roll, Incorporated.

The program itself was a massive undertaking, and included rare interviews and exhaustive retrospectives of the roots of rock 'n' roll. According to the demo, "the initial cost of the program exceeded $75,000 and expended over 12,000 man-hours of research, writing and production." (Simple math reveals the cost of those man-hours at a little over $6 an hour - which seems hard to believe, but it was nearly 30 years ago.)
