,Franchise_Edin,2006-02-21T12:28Z,"Hi Can someone else please seed this torrent? Im so desperate to get it - would even purchase it from someone who had it, please please please!.

Thank you. "
,bugsfan8898,2006-02-25T05:48Z,"This has to be one of the worst torrents on here. There aren't seperate tracks for each song. Instead, they're all jumbled together on 15 min. long tracks. What a fucking waste of time. I want individual tracks that represent each song, not a 15 min. mess..."

Thank you very very much"
,mrfr0gz,2006-07-17T02:56Z,"Ignore kaido20. For the time being, I am seeding the original file(s) again.
If you go to the readme link at the top of the torrent page, you will see this is one of the greatest rock and roll documentaries ever. Besides the interviews and commentary of the artists, support staff, managers, and the like, you also get the music. You could spend hours and hours searching the web for good copies from these early artisits. I prefer this in show format, however it does consist of 2 giant files and I don't have the time to edit or extract them further. Feel free to do so on your own if you are so inclined.
Enjoy."
