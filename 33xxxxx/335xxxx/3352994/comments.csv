,decrain,2005-07-07T14:47Z,"could you please write comments in english? if you want to get some answears from me.... i can help only when i understand what you are writing. and i don't understand swedish.
this version of dungeon keeper 2 is multilingual version with polish language. first cd installs game in english but if somebody wants to have this game in polish has to begin installation from the second cd. there is a polish menu."
,stamate,2005-07-07T18:36Z,what is about in this game
,PiNNHEAD,2005-07-13T09:46Z,"Great fucking uppload dude. One quick one. Is there anyone who has a problem with the movies? The game works fine and all, but the game skipps the movie. Why? Don't know. Any one?"
,Smarmeh,2005-07-19T02:58Z,"Advice to the guy below, and any others wondering,  rather than asking the uploader about a game, just google it. That's how you ""shop"" for torrents that you don't know about."
,Thomaz,2005-07-26T22:09Z,"So, how do I make it work? How do I use the crack!?"
,j0nk0,2005-08-05T02:12Z,"hur får man det att funka?? 
jag har insallerat det med cd1.... 
sedan när jag tryker på exe filen där jag installerat det så händer inget??"
,olavgunnersen,2005-08-05T08:19Z,"First off all, you don't have to download more than cd1... and to make the game work, you'll have to install the 1.70 patch located on cd1... then copy the crack from cd1 over the .exe in your DK2 directory.

That's how I got it to work."
,j0nk0,2005-08-05T15:21Z,"
