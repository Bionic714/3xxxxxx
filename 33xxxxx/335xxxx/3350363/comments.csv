,Aurtach,2005-06-30T06:26Z,"LOL  I don't know but it has happened to me before to.  No worries though. 

Yes please let me know what you think about te quality.  I am still in the experimenting stage of encoding for PSP and will apreciate feedback so I can fine tune my technique.  But I feel that this rip is pretty damn good.  I noticed that it is a tiny tiny bit squashed but that is a result from the DVD source.  My copy of the DVD and the avi file I have for it are both like that.  But it is not very noticable.  "

great movie thanks!!!!"
,Aurtach,2005-07-21T10:18Z,"Here are the settings that I used in PSPvideo9 for this movie:
Resolution: 368x208
Video bitrate: Variable 256 - 512
Framerate: 29.97
Audio bitrate: 64kbps Stereo
Volume: 180%
Passes: two

That shou get the movie small enough to fit on your 512 with some room to spare."
