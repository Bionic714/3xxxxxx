Plot:
Shaun (Simon Pegg) is your below average thirtysomething who seems to have no real goal in life. Lacking any real ambition, he drives his long-suffering girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) around the bend. He seems to pay more attention to his fellow loser pals and housemates Ed (Nick Frost)and Pete (Peter Serafinowicz). Shaun is otherwise a decent enough sort. He soon realises how much Liz means to him when the dead begin to walk the earth. Now it's a race against time for Shaun to spring to the rescue not just of the girl he loves, but of his dear sweet Mum as well. After watching this you'll never look at "Dawn of the Dead" the same way again.
