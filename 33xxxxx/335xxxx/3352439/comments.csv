,PMental,2005-07-06T02:57Z,"Wicked! Looks like a really cool series, and I had no idea it existed. The ""Fans of this may also like"" link at IMDB points to Coupling, which is a good sign (hilarious comedy series)."

,miksit,2005-08-17T19:37Z,"Vlc does pretty much eat everything - except mp4 (for me), but it eats that for everyone else as well. Bastard thing. This is one funny ass tv series - as is series 2, fully recommended (especially for stoners)"

,Deznaj,2007-11-23T23:54Z,"This series sucks ass compared to series like Black Books and Blackadder.

Still worth the download though."
,floeji,2008-01-07T06:37Z,I'm upset that I couldn't get the box sets from Amazon. They won't play on US DVD players. Simon Pegg is brilliant!
,sanctusmilitus,2008-06-29T07:59Z,"Actually it should read:
Co-created by Simon Pegg (who starred in and co-wrote Sean of the Dead) and Jessica Stevenson (Who played Yvonne in Sean of the Dead), and directed by Edgar Wright (Who directed and co-wrote Sean of the Dead)."
