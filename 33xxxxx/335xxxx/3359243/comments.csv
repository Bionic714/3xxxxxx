Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is the movie you want and after that Final Fantasy:  Dirge of Cerberus, in order to continue the ever so great story of Final Fantasy VII"

,hellbringer616,2008-08-06T05:57Z,"No such game, File size far to small to be anything, even in .rar compression it would still be at least hundreds of MB for a CD and and AT LEAST 1.7GB of a PS2 game.

My guess bogus file or virus, save yourself from trouble. don't download."
