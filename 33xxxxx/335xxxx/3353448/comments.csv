,Karmacom,2005-07-08T17:11Z,"Janker, sometimes you can, but most of the time not. Depends on if the key it generates is valid, and if it's not duped (someone else using the same key).

Some of the keys the generator produces are invalid by default, even if they were unique, while some of them are valid, best way to test that is to run the game setup, if it allows installing with the generated key, then it means it's valid, but someone will likely use that too more often than seldom, thus it will be duped online and become invalid."
,janker,2005-07-08T18:11Z,"Karmacom: Thanks for tip, but setup allows only modify/remove when game is already installed. Or is there a trick for that?

How to find cracked servers? Are they listed ingame or do I have to use ASE or some other software?"
,Karmacom,2005-07-08T23:29Z,"Janker, keyword search for words like ""key"" , ""free"", ""open"", ""cd"" ""no"" etc. in the ingame serverlist browser.

This patch is for if you allready have the game installed yes, either the clone, reloaded version or retail version (or any other version)."

So, uh, wtf?
Using F-secure anti virus software here."
,Karmacom,2005-07-15T16:47Z,"kizke,  onceisenough.exe removes duped lines in textfiles, and is not a virus, if F-secure reports it as a virus, then F-secure is simply wrong (nothing new there, commercial antivirus sucks , only made for making money for big coorporations.)"

""battlefield 2 private servers"""
,damnit199,2005-08-02T21:33Z,"YESS! It worked for me. THANKS!!!!!! I have a Battlefield2 RELOADED DVD version. This is what I did. Before you start clean your Registry of previous installations(I used, Ace Utilities) 1)Install a clean version of Battlefield 2 Reloaded. Use vitality Keygen if you need to or any key-gen that works.(you can change it later with the BF2 keygen changer) 2)Restart your computer when it asks after finishing BF2 installation. 3)Donot apply the NoCD/DLL patch, A big NO!!! But do Install the v1.02 official ""client"" patch. 4)Install Daemon tools if you don't have it on your PC and restart your computer when its finished installation. 5)Mount the BF2 mini image(mds file) by right clicking the daemon tools icon in the system tray bar. 6)Use the ""original"" desktop shortcut of Battlefield2 and it'll work fine. I repeat, all you have to do after mounting the mini-image is go to your desktop and click on the ORIGINAL BF2 .exe and the game works!!! It did for me!......And my computer configuration is > P4 3Ghz/ 1GB 333Mhz DDR Ram/ 128mb 6600GT/ 200GB Maxtor SATA HDD/ WinXP Pro SP2 with every patch to this date. .... Ok that should be enough for comparisons! Hope your works too and hey don't forget to say thanks."
