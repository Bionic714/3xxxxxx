,santaclaus1986,2008-07-24T20:42Z,"If this is the right torrent i downloaded the game from, what is the password needed to extract?"
,BlackFlag66,2008-07-26T09:37Z,"#1- this game was originally designed for win 9x.  you will have problems getting it to run on 2k, xp, and vista, if you even can.

#2 - the PC version is a direct port, containing no graphical enhancements (boo!).

#3 - for graphics quality, compatability, and stability, you'll be better off running the PS1 version in an emulator."
