,cantonesejim,2005-07-18T07:00Z,"I can't get it to run, it keeps saying something bout a publication file"
,Kickmyballs,2005-07-18T10:42Z,What is the exact error message you are getting ?
,cantonesejim,2005-07-18T18:52Z,cannot find publication file
,Kickmyballs,2005-07-19T17:32Z,It sounds to me like you may have a corupt download. The Publication it referes to is internal to the exe file if it can't find it it probale means there is some corruption and it can't find the begining of the publication at the point in the exe file it was expecting it.
