,milkrock,2006-06-28T09:20Z,this says there is a seeder on the tracker but I've been downloading for days and it says there is only  .929 available online of the file. 0 seeds and 10 peers even though .. yeah. Could someone seed it.

,Compupaq,2008-05-26T07:50Z,Please Seed. I've been at 93% for around a month.  I will seed it back when I'm finished.
,CreatorRaven,2008-07-12T02:16Z,"If somebody could seed this, that'd be slightly awesome.  I've been at 93% for about 3 months or so now.  I'll seed it for a month straight if I can just get that last 7%..."

,eboni,2009-01-25T12:42Z,"gets up to 92.9% as there are no seeders, and also it seems the audio is French, and not even properly dubbed...... im not pleased"
,wetWeasel,2009-07-30T10:25Z,"Now going onto the fourth week of downloading, and still waiting for the seed. It's been sitting at 92.2% for at least 14 days (probably longer) 

If someone lets us get the last 0.8% I promise I'll seed for the next month....Honestly....no kidding.."
