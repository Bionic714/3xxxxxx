An MMORPG from South Korea, favoring equipment build-up and PvP/GvG.

This is the official client as of 07/07/2005, setup step removed, repacked with www.7-zip.org (1.4Gb vs 1.88Gb).

Graphics: very nice, focused on personnages rather than scenery.
Sound/Music: fair.
Interface: poor, but manageable.
Gameplay: save and build up your gear, find efficient parties, level up, join a clan, battle or ally other clans and ultimately siege one of the few castles or beat the highest bosses.

Minimum hardware requirements:
-Processor 800MHz
-Memory 256MB
-GeForce2 3D graphic card

Software requirements:
-DirectX v9.0c

And of course a server:

-Private (many buged, few c3)
