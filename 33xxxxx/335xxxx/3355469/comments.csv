,lol_lol,2005-07-13T12:07Z,is any server free?
,Musaran,2005-07-13T19:05Z,"I am alone seeding this file at the moment, and I up only at 160kbps max.

If size and install steps are not a problem to you, just download from official: ftp://l2clientdownload.lineage2.com/Chronicle03/L2_C3_Installer.zip

Private serveers are free.
Just get ready for bugs, wierdness, occasional wipe, down times, ect"
