just an observation."

,koppartrans,2005-08-07T17:28Z,Hur spelar man nerladdade gamecube spel på sitt gamecube?? skivorna är ju så små så det går väll inte att bränna??
,ntelis,2006-08-23T19:33Z,please seed!!! i want to play this as soon as possible
,Macoco,2008-01-02T14:47Z,"You need a chipp in your gamecube, xenogc, viper, qoob etc... and then either burn on minidvd-r or regular dvd-r but if it's regular you'll need a new case to fit the big dvds... ehm... swedish site console.se has lots of info. Ofcourse, you can only use a game you own the rights to use. (becuase nintendo do allow backups, if you manage to create one)."
