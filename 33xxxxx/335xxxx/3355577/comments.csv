Does the serial work for installer provided with this torrent ?

Would like to know, before switching from v2.0 final that works very well for me."
,shadowny,2005-07-16T20:41Z,"When I installed 2.3, the serial worked for me. I'm very sorry about the problems. I installed the program with the serial number in the torrent, which is below, and it works fine. Judging by the feedback, the serial # may have expired. If that's the case, I'm truly sorry. I was unable to find a keygen when packing the torrent, and since the serial number worked for me, I figured it would be OK.  :(  

Please accept my apologies and keep checking, a keygen is probably available, I just couldn't find one.

The serial number I installed with:

Serial: 000020-acm831-23kku1-fj01b4-rhff1c-3t4xua-w2tnc8-kc30h4-8xzvpm-e4wdkg-90nnvc-qtb61h-w04urp-zc70q1-9hg5pp-etrxef-41v4ze-zbkc51-vq3yp0-dxc5mb  - - - - - -  The ID for this personal key is na99184530.

Best of luck. (And the serial worked for a lot of people, there were 1000+ downloads and only 2 feedback msgs, I know it worked for a friend who downloaded the torrent in it's first day.)

Best regards,
Shadow"
