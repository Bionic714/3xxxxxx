Release Notes:

Fooled By April has always been a bundle of
contradictions. Some describe them as the bastard
sons of Cheap Trick and Fountains Of Wayne, while
others compare them more to what the Clash might
have been had they listened to a lot more KISS. Too
pop to be rock, too rock to be pop, the band's
ragged rock-and-roll enthusiasm is always tempered
by the need to get those four-part harmonies just
right.

The band's precursor EP (produced by Whiskeytown's
Mike Daly, and also available here on CDBaby.com)
turned some heads by being the #1 seller on
CDBaby.com in its first two weeks and a continuous
top-seller since. And as one of the top-ten most
added records in the country in its first week at
radio, it later broke into the CMJ Top 200 chart. It
wasn't long before many TV and film placements came
through MTV, Sony, Disney and several independents,
culminating in a national heavy-use placement of
their song, "Nice to See You," by the ABC Family
Channel over the past year on network and cable. Not
too shabby for an unsigned band doing it all on
their own.

This new self-titled record is the band's first
full-length, so the CD Release itself warranted a
big show and a huge party. On June 4th, 2005, Fooled
By April headlined in front of 300 people at the
Paradise Rock Club with their good buddies Scamper
supporting, along with two hot new major label acts
opening, The Redwalls and American Minor. It was a
crowning achievement after the band's relentless
touring of the Northeast and Midwest, which has
brought them to many showcases at the CMJ Music
Festival in New York City, the NEMO Festival in
Boston and the prestigious South by Southwest
Festival in Austin, TX.

Enjoy the record, and please leave a comment and let
the boys know what you think!
