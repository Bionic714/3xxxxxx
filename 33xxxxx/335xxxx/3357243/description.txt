I dig all of Blue Cheers album (hey, who doesnt dig Vincebus eruptum??) THis album is just as good imho. For those that didnt know; Blue Cheer is the name of a brand of LSD, thus explaining the err wild and free spirited mood of their music. THese guys are the founding fathers off all things that are Heavy & Hard in music - man they rock :D

This is blue Cheers most psychedelic album and the album that invented heavy acid stoner rock. With surreal lyrics, insane production (with instruments panning all over the place), this album rips along with all guns blazing as it tears a dayglo trail through your brain. Tracks like "Gypsy Ball" and "Sun Cycle" are psych classics that must be heard.
