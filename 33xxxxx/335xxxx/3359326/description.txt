Review

Plastic Soul Impalement is definitely not one of those albums where you listen to the first cut and then decide if you want it or not. The aforementioned title cut is a dark, haunting tune consisting primarilly of whispered vocals and slow, machine like noises and clicks, and is absolutely nothing like the rest of the disc. With their feet planted in an extremely intense hardcore mindset, this California four-piece show a real experimental side on Plastic Soul Impalement, mixing a bit of everything from industrial and goth, to samples and effects, resulting in a brutal, complexly structured, often chaotic sound, that's largely unheard of in bands this powerful and heavy.
