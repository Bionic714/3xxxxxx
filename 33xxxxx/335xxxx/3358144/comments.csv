,thevalleyman,2005-07-20T13:13Z,Is it the real thing?
,jamal_27,2005-07-20T18:24Z,"mackie mcbroom
for u to view the file...
download winrar..
open the program and click on extract files..
the files will be the split ones containing the movie..best to keep it in one folder and high light all...after that click ok
then u select the destination to put the file that has them all together ..
then burn if u can or just watch..recommend vlc...best
peace"
,bomis123,2005-07-20T19:53Z,"1.download winrar (u will find it here on piratebay)
2.open the map with all the rarfiles, pick the first file and then right click and select ""extract here"" Now all the rarfiles will be unpacked in to one single big file in the same map, in this case it will be a .avi file.
3. Now download vlc player from:
http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html
4. install vlc player on your computer
5.open vlc player and chose ""quick open file list""
now you just have to browse on your harddrive and pick up the avi-file doubleclick it and zimzala bim the movie will run......"
,thevalleyman,2005-07-20T20:48Z,I had a look at the sample. This is not screener material. Looks like a (rather bad) cam.
,Administrator,2005-07-21T09:59Z,you know know that you cant trust any releases from Zapto then dont you
,ULTiMA_nz,2005-07-21T21:36Z,"Shit old cam! , Not a Screener as listed, ta for nothing :("
,Blood Brother,2005-08-12T09:02Z,the picture is too bright.. so just wait for a dvd version... the movie is okay.. nothing special... Adam Sandler has done better
