,wizy,2005-07-16T04:24Z,"god you people calling it a virus are idiots.  Those things are classified as viruses by the Anti-Virus community because most virus writers use packers like those to make their viruses smaller.  Since nearly no one else uses those tools they classify the tool itself (not even a file created by it,0) as a virus."
