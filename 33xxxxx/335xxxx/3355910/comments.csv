Thanx SkepticalE. "
,lorgion,2005-07-14T14:38Z,"I disagree, the visual quality is really off and there is this really annoying background noice durring the entire episode (perhaps it is the ghosts). I'm hoping for a better rip."
,MichaD,2005-07-14T15:56Z,"Yes, quality really sucks, and I'm very tolerable concerning quality"
,rancidcrab,2005-07-14T23:41Z,"Well, at any rate, I've certainely downloaded much worse files (here and elsewhere).  I did mispeak about the VLC changing aspect ratio.  It's Media Player Classic that will easily do that... >View>Pan&Scan.  VLC might do this, but I don't know where."
