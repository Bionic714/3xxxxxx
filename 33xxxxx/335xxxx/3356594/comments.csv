I bought it on a Swedish site due to the fact that i am Swedish :D
Let’s see here. (Scrolling through Browser history)
Ah! Right it must have been: http://www.speldirekt.com/
They have it for PS2 as well as Pc at a highly reasonable price.
Unfortunately the site didn’t let me link any specific pages. So you’re going to have to start from the default page."

By the way, to make delhi(The chick) nude, just go to the Giants\Bin directory and remove the file ""arpfix.gzp""....That should work I believe :3
(I'm not entirely sure if it will work but once this finishes downloading I'll check and comment again!)
AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE UPLOAD AND ALSO...........SEEEEEEEED FAGGOTS!"

,DeadSausages,2011-11-09T09:04Z,"Hey everyone... I really hope that this post gets some attention. I'm itching to play this game like no other. Anyway, I installed the game and all. Completely, even ran the 2nd BIN. BUT. When I start the game, it asks for me to put a disk in the drive, even when the first BIN file is mounted. Any ideas? Would burning the BIN onto a disk and doing it that way work?"
