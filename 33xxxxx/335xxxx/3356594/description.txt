I couldn’t find this game anywhere so I bought it and made my own release.
It’s a two 650mb-cd's game. And I took the liberty of including the latest patch on the first disc.
There’s no need for any kind of crack. Just keep the first disc mounted and you’ll be fine.

The seeding will be slow, you can count on that.
I’ve only got 0.5 mbit upstream so... well you do the math.
And if any problems should arise during the first week I won’t be here to fix em.
Cause ill be on vacation :)

Anyway just be patient and you will get you copy.

Enjoy!
