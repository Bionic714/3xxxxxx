hey peeps... just got home from vacation. i see not much have happened while i was gone, so i thought i would ease the pain with a new bootleg. its from ozzfest, but i cant tell you if its a great show or not, cos i havent seen it yet. but anyway i wanted to share it with all you guys.
01 Pollution
02 Leech
03 Jump Around
04 Nobody loves me
05 Blind
06 Counterfeit cut
07 Stuck
08 Faith

and while youre doing nothing anyway visit B2B and speak up... ;)

on another note, take a look at the new hub on DC++
its started by the pollution-crew (too lazy to find a link), and you can meet other sharers/traders, that are willing to let you download from them. only demand is that you share 2 gb of media (Bizkit is more than welcome) and have 3 open slots.

that should be it for now. take care, and lets hope the priest will be Bizkits new single. at least i do ;)
