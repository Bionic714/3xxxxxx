Islam - Empire of Faith [2000]

Between the fall of Rome and the European voyages of discovery, few events were more significant than the rise of Islam. Within a few centuries, the Islamic empires blossomed, projecting their power from Africa to the East Indies, and from Spain to India. Inspired by the words of the Prophet Muhammed, and led by caliphs and sultans, this political and religious expansion remains unequaled in speed, geographic size and endurance. 

Islam - Empire of Faith is narrated by the actor Ben Kingsley (http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0001426/). 

*coincidently "Sir Ben Kingsley" is also the actor in Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's List" (1993) (http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0108052/) playing Itzhak Stern, one of the lead actor. May be this give you to think about if Jewish make a film about the Islam - Empire of Faith....
