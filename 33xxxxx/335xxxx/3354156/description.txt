Free Internet TV is an Internet television tuner program that allows you to view over 750 online TV stations from around the world. There is no need for a PC TV card because the TV channels are streamed through your internet connection. Although 56K internet connection is adequate, a high speed internet connection will deliver superior audio and video quality. This software comes with free automatic TV station updates so it will never be out of date. If you are interested in learning languages or alternative programming, this is a good choice for you!
