,oblodo,2005-07-09T21:59Z,"Its a scam, a fucking retard, who just gives u a list to fucking lame channels.... All the channels can be found at a lot of other web pages. This is spyware, or just plain stupid. Most ""channels"" he is talking about , are community streams, at 100kbps... For real streaming tv.. goggle it (im not gona spam, but hey HBO in SVCD quality IS cewl... but this program is not, i repeat, NOT going to get you real cewl tv)... there are a lot of other things to do... get Winamp and google for live tv streams.........  ;)  750 lame ass slow channels my ass, M.Lindoso.. go fuck yourself"
,oblodo,2005-07-09T22:02Z,"another thing.. most of us are not so stupid, that we download a small exe file...... small exe files are for idiots.. (on a p2p net, that is) and a sign of vira, or malware"
,m.lindoso,2005-07-09T22:24Z,"I agree that files with extension. exe can be signs of virus or malwares, I never posted any file could contain such risks to my computer or Pirate Bay members. It doesn't contain virus or malwares. I am not a mad."
,bigpigg,2005-07-09T22:25Z,this shit doesn´t work! 0 stars! bad bad!!!!!
,oblodo,2005-07-09T22:32Z,"you are stil a retard... probably not mad.. but clearly a moronic idiot spammer, with an IQ same as your shoe size. Lame idiot... tell me ONE real TV station u can get... thats not a lame news stream(not live) or a local gov, channel?? Just name one channel that has premium series, and movies...

its the homepage for this lame spam program... its a scam.. get it? They want you to pay $19.99 for a list of links ( ok in a nice gui, but hell, all of the same channels can be found via 100s of web pages... yes, they even have more channels than that... )  if u still do not belive me, and want this crapy program.. get it from the ppl that made it... 14 free trial, so you can see this is the lamest aplication since Bonzai Buddy.... )"

,pelle1,2011-09-08T06:08Z,"WoW, soo much flaming for an unnecessary program...we are talking a small program used to watch TV....good TV or bad TV, that is up to the user...but still TV.
Oblodo, take your medicine and wait for it to set in...
Nobody forced you to download it...that was your own choice, same as when you give up your ass to a stranger in a public toilet."
