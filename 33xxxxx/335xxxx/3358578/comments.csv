,kant69,2005-07-20T16:13Z,thanks Tinny!!
,beerandcheesecake,2005-07-20T16:21Z,Thanks dude!  Is there anything special that needs to be done to view an .asf file?
,kitk,2005-07-20T16:40Z,"I hope tinman is coming back! We need you!
BTW, WTF is up with our shows this summer?
Don't the MI** ever rest? "
,Richie2182,2005-07-20T16:42Z,"nah .asf is a windows media player extension, or u can use the VLC media player, it plays anything and everything"
,tinman22,2005-07-20T16:43Z,You need the Windows Media Codecs (or Windows Media Player) installed.
,kriskris,2005-07-20T18:12Z,"vlc is always the answer

thanks guys."
,tinman22,2005-07-20T19:43Z,"Maybe because the show changed schedules last weekend, something got  screwed up. Funny, it wasn't that long ago when almost all the uploaded video was this quality. I'm just happy that someone put it up to usenet because I really would hate to miss an ep., bad quality or not."
,madstewie,2005-07-20T19:58Z,i agree and thanks tinman22 for turning this file into a torrent for the masses!!
,mmind,2005-07-20T20:09Z,"Oh man what a crappy quality!! However, better than nothing, so thanks tinman!

Really hope some real group will release ep.7 soon. Wonder why no one has? All cappers on vacation? Strange."
,Richie2182,2005-07-20T20:44Z,"it is shitty quality but i just full screened it and sat onthe couch, so it wouldn't look as bad, but yeah the HDTV version should be coming soon I hope."
,birdmcfc,2005-07-20T22:07Z,Yeah MASSIVE thanks tinman for passing this along...
,drakehead,2005-07-21T04:32Z,"There is another torrent for this up.  It looks like the real HDTV avi file.  I haven't downloaded yet though.

,Branstrom,2005-07-21T05:35Z,I want this show back! :-(
,chronjohnson,2005-07-21T05:40Z,Why is it so hard to get Six Feet Under rips this season?  What's the point of ASF...almost like ripping a tv show using a camcorder.  Wonder if HBO upped this to usenet to continue their campaign of poisoning the well.
,kant69,2005-07-21T06:13Z,"Drakehead - I'm not sure what to make of the new - and relatively huge - file. Presumably it is a vcd, but when you try to download it, it resembles a standard avi , and the isp list is very suspicious (it includes all the ones that peer guardian try to filter out).

Procede with caution. If anybody tries to download it, make sure you have peer guardian running ...and please report back to us.   "
,angrydroid,2005-07-21T06:58Z,"if you really want to know why it's so difficult to get SFU eps this season, it's because Alan Ball hates us. ever notice all the product placement in the recent seasons? he's pure syndicate through and through. they were even making deals with HBO and TiVO that would delete your PVR'd episodes the instant the dvd hit the stores. they've hired a team of hackers from new jersey (the name eludes me) who have been behind all the file spoofing. fun Fun FUN! :)"
,drakehead,2005-07-21T07:10Z,"Well I download the avi from 10mbit.  it's pretty crappy quality.  not HDTV but it will suffice.

Though I think this might even be an avi converted from the asf file."
,kant69,2005-07-21T07:52Z,"Drakhead, how does it compare to the original source file?"
,kant69,2005-07-21T11:08Z,"Where the fuck is tripwire? Not just cause we need him, but I'm sort of worried about him now."
,brainrust,2005-07-21T11:28Z,"he's probably just on vacation. but it doesn't matter, cause that link i posted has a great quality episode 7.."
,kant69,2005-07-22T00:42Z,"thanks brainrust - great working torrent, and great episode too."
