,racxie,2008-07-04T04:37Z,"Same request as Maetryx, could someone please re-seed this? Or at least could someone else possibly upload another torrent of this album?

Would be much appreciated."
,racxie,2008-07-11T17:26Z,"Cheers Edgeless, that would be much appreciated =)

As for the quality as long as they're at least 128kbps i dont mind =p and hope it's an actual CD rip rather than a compilation someone's made off limewire or something, lol.

I managed to get hold of Motel Murder Madness so there is already a torrent for that, but upload it anyway if you feel the need.

But again thanks in advance."
