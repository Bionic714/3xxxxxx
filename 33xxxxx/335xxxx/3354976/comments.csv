What kind the game it is and when it was released? It's so old?"

[M],Q91,2005-07-19T11:21Z,"since you need to install MB to have ReAct to work, I made a quick fix for those who doesnt have installed Melty Blood, or are not willing to add support for asian characters.
could properly add it to my websit aswell as a quick  readme.txt that prop tell you how to do it"

,Kryojenix,2007-08-04T23:16Z,does this contain Act Cadenza ver. B?
,CCRLH85,2007-09-13T00:20Z,"Nope this torrent doesn't include Act Cadenza.  Also, this method of putting them together isn't compatible with Revolve/Mirror-Moon's updated translation patches for the game.  This one does include an older version of the Revolve translation though."
,rubiximus,2007-09-26T20:50Z,"I just finished downloading this and am having trouble with the installer. It would reach 95%, show an error, and close. I then tried changing location and non-unicode to Japanese and after restarting the installer would freeze before even opening.

I am beginning the download again in case a part was corrupted. If that's not the problem a solution would be appreciated."
,rubiximus,2007-10-08T03:56Z,Sweet the second one works...
