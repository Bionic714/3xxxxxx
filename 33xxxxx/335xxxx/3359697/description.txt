Hi, this is a very nice jazz dvd ripped by Yanouche. Many many thanks to Yanouche :) This is what he says about this torrent

John Zorn Projects 
Warsaw Summer Jazz Days'99 
June 25th 1999 
Sala Kongresowa, Warsaw, Poland 

Three John Zorn projects: 
Masada string Trio 
Bar Kokhba 
Masada 
(DVD has three chapters for each band) 

this comes from my VHS tape recording of TV broadcast that was shown just a week or two after the event took place. unfortunetly it was edited, so there's only 82 minutes of video from 3 hours of that amazing Zorn fest, but it's still better than nothing. there's also some other problem with my recording - the image cuts off 3 minutes before the end of the last song (they said it will be 1 hour programme, so i've set automatic turn off thing in video recorder giving some 20 minutes more in case of anything - still the broadcast happend to be 3 minutes longer :/ ). but when the image cuts off, the sound is still there. why? i've taken it from the other audio source that was seeded on EZT some time ago, so you can experience the show till its end (while on the screen there's a sign 'warsaw summer jazz days'99 from the beginning). sound from my video source was so poor (lots of hiss, constant humming and mono - while in the upper right corner of the screen it says 'stereo', what a shame), that i decided to pick up excellent soundboard recordings of those gigs and synchronize with the image. of coarse, the video has some small magnetic tape drop-outs (especially in the beginning) as i've been using this cassette a bit for those six years. it's the best form of this material i can offer - hope you'll enjoy it.
