,dj_tesla,2005-07-19T18:44Z,"How r they? That is, the songs are mixed or not?"
,dj_chewmacca,2005-07-19T19:40Z,"RE: What are you talking about?  Ofcourse the tracks are mixed.  If you want them to join seamlessly you will need to configure your Winamp accordingly...

Click on the top left button of Winamp, then Options, Preferences, select DirectSound output and click on Configure.  Select Buffering and set Buffer-ahead on track change to about 300 ms.  Now select Fading and set the Default fade length to 0 ms.  And that's pretty much it.  For users who have slower PC's may need to increase the buffer so that it doesn't leave any gaps.

For any users who haven't heard of Winamp can get it from www.winamp.com

Enjoy! ;)

,PhaZEtwO™,2005-07-20T15:12Z,"chewmacca, i found the same torrent as this but its 3.52 gig (whats the difference?)
I just wanted to say... a while back I had my entire cd, cassette and vinyl collection stolen and i have been desperatly trying to piece together some of the tunes i used to have.
this collection is wonderful (thanx!!!) it has MANY of the tracks i used to have (not the same as owning them all on vinyl but great to hear some of the tunes mixed) again thanx :-)"
