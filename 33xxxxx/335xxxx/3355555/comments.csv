,jaguar911,2005-07-14T10:14Z,WMA's  ???   It would B better if you posted the albums seperate so someone who wanted one didn't have 2 D/L all ???  and post or make it clear that they ain't mp3's but f*****g wmas
,hassanhassan,2005-07-15T04:58Z,lets see here. if you knew how to properly use bittorrent (obviously you don't) you would know that you can select not to download certain files (as in your little bitch ass could only download one of these albums instead of all) hmm...sound good? here's another thing. if you have such a GIANT problem with wma...convert it. it takes five minutes. stop being a whiney prick and suck it up.

,BJK84,2005-08-05T16:26Z,"thanks hassan, youre the man"
,brassman,2006-04-09T15:31Z,Just download an audio converter...
,Raz0K,2006-04-11T23:08Z,"Fuck, people, will you ever learn to give a description? 
Wma is just a bad codec. No advantages at all.  And converting it only causes a loss of quality, so what's the point?"
