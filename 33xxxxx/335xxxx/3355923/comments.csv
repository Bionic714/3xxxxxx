Hope you enjoy it. The naviagtor served me well a couple of years ago, when I took the car for a major tour. I have CDs for BeNeLux and Germany as well, but they are even older. Better if someone could share some newer files.

I would be very happy to find France and Spain CDs. Anyone???

For you how leeched it from me, please help me seed it for a couple of days. If you bail out, I will too. The idea is to share what you are given."

I think I was the one who made the request.
I only discovered it now. There is only one peer left; 
CAN someone start it again for a couple of hours?

Can I return a favour for different RTI's?"
