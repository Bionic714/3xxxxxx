Alternative rockers Fuel comprised singer/guitarist Brett Scallions, guitarist Carl Bell, bassist Jeff Abercrombie, and drummer Kevin Miller. A product of Pennsylvania, the quartet debuted in 1996 with an independently released EP, Porcelain; the disc sold over 10,000 copies locally, with the single "Shimmer" becoming a major hometown radio favorite. Its success brought Fuel to the attention of Sony's 550 imprint, which released the EP Hazleton the following year. The band's debut full-length, Sunburn, appeared in 1998. Again, "Shimmer" proved Fuel's calling card, almost making the national Top 40 and -- with "Bittersweet," "Jesus or a Gun," and the title track (featured on the Scream 3 soundtrack) also earning airplay -- helping Sunburn to platinum-record status. Fuel's second album, Something Like Human, followed two and a half years later. ~ Jason Ankeny, All Music Guide
