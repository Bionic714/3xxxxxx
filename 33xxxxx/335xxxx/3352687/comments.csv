,djroach,2005-07-07T00:08Z,"Thanks again for all the uploads pokerfreak.  I know many of us had been waiting for weeks to see this one, and wow, what a final.

This episode has got to be up in the top 5 all-time episodes, at least in terms of the pressure, intensity, and drama that is on display.  And we get a full two hours instead of and hour and a half.

If you're hesitating about d/l-ing this for some reasom, wise up and hit that download button right now!"
