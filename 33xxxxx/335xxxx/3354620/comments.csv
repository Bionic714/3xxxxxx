,dbat,2005-07-11T14:05Z,"IMHO you should read first atleast alteast one guide  for encoding to get things somewhat right. Looks like you have done prettymuch everything wrong. Deinterlace,right resolution and croping follow those   up first following possibly some noise filters with avisynth usage. Its not about the quantity its the quality that counts ;) Keep up the good work and dont forget to use episode number when naming ;)"
