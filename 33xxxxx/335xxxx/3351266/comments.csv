,Dust2Dust,2005-07-02T16:23Z,"nope this is not the beta version, if you have installed the beta previously I recommend you download the restore utility I cmade first. It will restore your Ipaq 2 2002 first, then ya should use this upgrade.

,jamafrind,2006-11-30T09:40Z,"Good morning All. I have just downloaded this software. This question has been asked before.... can I use this to update the OS on my iPAQ 3950? Any help would be hugely appreciated.

Many thanks in advance. Cheers....."
,jamafrind,2006-11-30T11:30Z,"...just to add to my last message, there does not appear to be a file to 'launch' the installation process. Perhaps this is not as it seems. I wait, in hope....."
,jamafrind,2006-11-30T12:24Z,"... if you haven't guessed it, I'm starting my own little thread here. I've renamed a couple of the ""zl"" extensions to ""exe"" and the files appear to be corrupted. Also, some key files required for installation are missing... according to a colleague who has worked for both MS and HP. I been 'gifted' some replacement exe files and will try them later. Watch this space....."
