This is four records with Karthago

Karthago - Karthago  (from a torrent of brainticket)
Karthago - Second Step (from a torrent of test78)
Karthago - Rock'n Roll Testament (I ripped it from my own CD EAC lame 320VBR)
Karthago - Live at the Roxy (I ripped it from my own CD EAC lame 320VBR)

for more info, see info files in directories and surf the net

My own humble oppinion is that the Rock'n Roll Testament is the best (and extreamly
good) since the vocals are much better.

And don't forget the early albums from Scorpions!!
