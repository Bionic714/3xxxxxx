,Burning Red Ivanhoe,2005-07-22T22:49Z,"Yeah this flick pissed me of too... tries to sell Igby like som kinda geek-hero and like it's about something important when it's all shit.. read Bret Easton Ellis if u like rich kids themes, much better in every way....

anyway ur other flicks blow my mind!

sb88: why don't you ever use the clever little ""imdb-link"" feat that TPB v. 2.0 introduced? "
[T],sickboy88,2005-07-23T01:33Z,"Yes, that's totally how I feel. It's a NEUROTIC movie.  None of these people's problems were worse than my problems, and you know...they want a fucking cookie for it?

It's like the one episode of South Park, were ""Chef"" is standing in front of the ""Genentic Engineer"" and next to him, is that little monkey creature in clothing...and Chef says ""What is that!? It's not anything!"" and he becomes really angry because there isn't a point...that's what happened here.

I never use the imdb thing because I didn't know that it made a clickable link.  I'll use it from now on."
,r3n,2005-08-06T17:46Z,"Complain all you'd like about the movie, but it's based on a very good book called The Catcher and the Rye. I havn't seen the movie yet to know how it compares, it probably wont. Movies very rarley compaire to movies. But all the same, stop complaining and read the book instead."
