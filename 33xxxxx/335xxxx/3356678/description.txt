Like some natural disaster, "Modern Life Is War" attacks without respite. The new album from "Witness" was recorded and engineered by Kurt Ballou (Converge) at God City Studios in Salem MA. "Witness" is not only musical progression for the band, but arguably true artistic perfection."Witness" is their true story of real ifestruggle in contemporary rural America.
