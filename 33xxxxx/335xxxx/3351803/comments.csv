but the mpeg2 encodes are trash, both this and the one I linked are way better."
,warpoc_muse,2005-07-04T02:11Z,"twas a shame I ended up with the logo of bbc3 in it tho...
I went to get the bbc1 (no logo) but I had a fail on my skybox :-("
,mycarrion2,2005-07-04T03:14Z,"Better is in the individual eye I suppose, and not just the bit count.  This one is much clearer and the camera transisitions do not shake like the other.  Could be a combination of capture and transefer that made the difference.

I just converted and burned this to DVD and it's brilliant!  All I had here was MTV and VH1 which both cut off half of CN.  Bastards.

Thanks so much for your time here!  I will share this far and wide!"

Thanks again,
