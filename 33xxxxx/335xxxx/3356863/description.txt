This Week In Tech (TWit) #13 - July 12, 2005.

I haven't had time to listen to this episode myself so I don't know any details on this episode. For those not familar with TWiT, Leo Laporte, Kevin Rose, etc. are veterans of America's now-defunct Tech TV cable channel. After the merger with the G4 channel they decided to carry on by broadcasting podcasts on all things tech. It's one of the fastest growing podcasts on the internet. Enjoy!
