,wildcatwillie,2005-07-20T18:51Z,"It's part of a historical military music collection  and isn't meant to promote Nazism or Hitler, you spaz."
,wildcatwillie,2005-07-21T05:29Z,"I'm well aware of Hitler's personal history. 

Again, this has nothing to do with promoting Hitler or the Nazis, or world domination. It is offered as a piece of historical military music the just happened to be played on Hitler's birthday. The only reason he was mentioned was to set the scene of the occasion of the recording....take it for what it is, not what you think it is.

,Panorama,2005-07-26T15:06Z,"boncuklar, everybody prefers different kind of art. Personally IÂ´m prefer the kind of art that de facto shows something real like landscapes etc. A lot of the so called modern art is just crap showing just a piece of paint in a mess. I could do this myself and I wouldnÂ´t call that for art to be shown in a museum. In this aspect Hitler was right."
,boncuklar,2005-07-27T03:42Z,"Well panorama, I am very sad for you, coz you know, what matters is not what *you* personally think of it or what your feelings are about it, it is what the history of human kind thinks and makes of it. I do not care about the fact that some people prefer a more 'simple' art, what I do care about is when this kind of people start thinking they can forbid all other kinds of art. You get the point? So if you do like this old fashioned simple art, if I can call it so for a moment, but are not planning to forbid the other more complex art or are not planning to murder the people that do love that art, I have nothing against you. But if you think, like Hitler did, that the more complex art should be forbidden, just because you do not understand it, you have to know that there would be a problem. Than I would have to fight you to keep my own freedom. But only to keep my own freedom, not because I do not understand you or don't like your kind of art. See my point? No offence, just think about it.  "
,k0nsl,2006-04-25T12:24Z,Maybe boncuklar prefers turd on canvases. Hitler didn't and he is a loser? OK.
