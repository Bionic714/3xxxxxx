I am sure all the Live 8 discs your are making will become collector's items for downloaders around the world. Thanks again and again. Cheers, andibi ..."
,Ritsch,2005-07-09T15:55Z,"It would be great if audio were good all over. 

But I'm satisfied anyway with audio. It's hard to record 10 hours on a PC without sound och video failure. It's not the best environment for recording. 

I'm impressed of ATIs All In Wonder- card. Good quality. I think this solution Is better than buying expensive harddisc recorder (standalone). You can adjust more with a PC and TV-card, set bitrate and sound quality etc.

If you're interested in buying TV-tuner card for PC, be aware of cheap products with mono-sound. Look for cards with stereo-sound.

,Ritsch,2005-07-09T16:16Z,"I found a fault In menu on this one. 

""Pet Shop Boys - Moskva"". It should have been ""Moscow"" (""Moskva"" is swedish name of the capital in Russian Federation). It's to late to change now but I'm going to change on my disc."
,sflocco,2005-07-09T16:37Z,"Will you be seeding any more discs?  How many discs will this set be?  Does anyone have any info on the MTV/VH1 rebroadcast of Live 8, where they are now going to show everyone's complete sets."
,sflocco,2005-07-09T16:38Z,BTW are these PAL or NTSC?
,sflocco,2005-07-09T16:39Z,Before I forget.  Thanks a ton for what you're doing with this.  You are a gentleman and a scholar.
,FatSlags,2005-07-09T16:54Z,You have done wonders with these dvds matey . I wondered why your contry flag is US when your in SE  I have also downloaded all of the other  mpegs from live 8  and the stv ones from you are the best I hope that the part from Will Smith when he has the crowd sing the prince of Bel Air theme tune is on this dvd .. As its not on the will smith live8 i downloaded 
,Ritsch,2005-07-09T17:04Z,"It's PAL.

After this two more discs."
,jantje2,2005-07-09T17:19Z,"Never mind the problems, I think everyone DL this DVd is aware of the difficulty of putting live performances to DVD

Thanks"
,mocciaro,2005-07-09T17:46Z,"Thank you Ritsch !!!!
A question: in the next disc are The Who, Pink Floyd and Paul McCartney ?
Federico"
,Ritsch,2005-07-09T18:39Z,"jantje2: Yeah it's OK but I should have checked menu before uploading. Now when uploaded it's hard to fix but before very easy to correct. 

Next one probably: 

Sting (2 or 3 songs)
Maroon 5 (1)
Mariah Carey (2)
Laura Pausini (1)
Robbie Williams (2 songs?)
The Who (must edit because they changed channel during performance) (2 songs)
Keith Urban (1)
Pink Floyd (all songs)

And probably make a last short disc with:

Mötley Crüe (1)
Stevie Wonder (& Rob Thomas) (2)
Paul McCartney (& George Michael) (2 or 3 songs?)
Final (all on stage) (Hey Jude - 1 song)


"
,Ritsch,2005-07-09T19:34Z,"I can take requests when all discs are ready and have complete sources. For example finale and maybe my version of Pink Floyd on a small DVD.

Damn, I play disc 4 now and I also noticed a one short sound failure in song by Snow Patrol. I know what casued it, but never mind, it's history now."
,carpark,2005-07-09T22:10Z,var är robbie williams? 
,Ritsch,2005-07-09T22:34Z,"Robbie Williams, The Who, Pink Floyd, Mariah Carey, Stevie Wonder, Sting, Maroon 5, Mötley Crüe etc coming up on next disc. Maybe two more but I think I can squeeze the rest into a last disc. 

More info later. "
,Ritsch,2005-07-09T22:37Z,"orton:

Sorry, no Deep Purple. Swedish tv didn't show them. "
,Ritsch,2005-07-09T23:03Z,"Sorry, mocciaro. I must seed the last (i hope so - if enough space) disc with finale and Pink Floyd, Stevie Wonder, Robbie Williams, Mariah Carey, George Michael, Paul McCartney, Maroon 5 etc. "
,Ritsch,2005-07-09T23:08Z,"To make things clear, my goal is to upload one last disc but no promise. If it's not working there will be two more discs."
,HSMistress,2005-07-10T01:26Z,You are a gem to do all this work for us!! I very much appreciate all that you have done. Will seed!!!
,Ritsch,2005-07-10T02:14Z,"Thank you.

Buy retail DVD and support Live 8. 



"
,mocciaro,2005-07-10T06:56Z,"Hey guys !!!. You must play the game right !!!
Keep seeding before download, not just ""take a go"".
The Ritsch work is exelent !!! "
,mocciaro,2005-07-10T20:24Z,"Oh! It's the disc 4 that waiting for....(The Who, Stevie Wonder, Pink Flod & Paul McCartney). When can you post the disc 5 ?
Thanks !
Federico"
,mocciaro,2005-07-10T20:24Z,Sorry: I'm waiting for the disc 5...
,Ritsch,2005-07-10T20:40Z,"Disc 5 will be uploaded but you must probably wait for it (up to one week from now, read my earlier comment).

I have problem right now creating the ISO-file. I can write a disc with DVD-making software and play with DVD-player (standalone). But I can't make a ISO of the disc. I get read error. I tried to copy content in directory VIDEO_TS and burned it with Nero but got errors. I think it's oversized = must maybe go for two discs. Or reprocess the whole dvd and this work take time. 

I'm going to upload disc 5 (or 5 + 6) but when I can't say right now. "
,mocciaro,2005-07-11T04:00Z,"OK Ritsch, I'll wait.
And about the ISO format. If you have problems with the ISO creation, simple upload the VIDEO_TS folder, it's the same....
All the best for you !
Federico"
,Ritsch,2005-07-11T11:13Z,"I managed to make a ISO-file yesterday. But without the AUDIO_TS directory. I can play disc on my Pioneer DV-470 standalone player. The dvd-making software doesn't include a AUDIO_TS directory and I don't think it's neccesary. Most players only need VIDEO_TS !?

mocciaro: I've tried to burn VIDEO_TS with Nero and got errors. When extracted and moved to Nero to burn, it's oversized (not before on disc) and I don't know why. 

"
,Ritsch,2005-07-11T11:18Z,"Soon there will be enough complete sources of disc 4, that's what I'm waiting for. But tomorrow I'm going away a couple of days. I can't seed disc 5 until I come back (friday or saturday week 28). "

,spikedzombies,2005-07-12T10:01Z,"OK Flame me all you want, but i just noticed you missed a few linkin park songs :/ did you get every song? or did you miss a few? Crawling and Somewhere I Belong + 2 others with JayZ were among the ones you missed? any reason why?"
,kokkie,2005-07-12T10:54Z,"@ WhiteShadow

I made those covers for myself to save some ink and because i didn't like the black Live 8 logo, didn't mean to offend or compete in any way... Sorry if you had that impression."
,WhiteShadow,2005-07-12T11:47Z,"@kokkie...no problem, its ok!"
