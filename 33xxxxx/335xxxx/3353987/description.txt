Notes:

Some bad audio on this disc. It's my recording, not the broadcasting. It's not audio dropouts, more like short noisy "beeps". 

I noticed sound failure in performance by Will Smith (two short noisy "beeps" in one song - minor problem), The Killers (two short "beeps" in middle of song - minor problem) and Joss Stone (short noisy "beeps" here and there through her peformance). The rest of the disc should be good. 

Sorry for sound problems. 

The song from Celine Dion is not that good. And audio out of sync audio (not my fault). Yannick Noah? It's the old tennisplayer and his performance is not so bad. But they could have shown another more interesting artist.
