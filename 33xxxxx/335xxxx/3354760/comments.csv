Uploaders notes:

Yup, this is the real dvdr release. From the same source as 
War.Of.The.Worlds.TC.XViD-XViD : http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3353347

As you can read in the comments for the XviD, the quality is amazing. Many people actually think its a dvdrip, but it's a very professional TeleCine.

So why is it not released by a real group? I dont know, my guess is that the elite groups wants to be anonymous because of the recent busts"
