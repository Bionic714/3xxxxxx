Best sound and picture I've come across. No synching problems with audio. It's a russian copy but somebody who knew what they were doing must have been able to fix the sound and improve the pictue. The picture still looks like it was taken from a video camera, but like I said earlier it's the best of the bunch, eminently watchable.
