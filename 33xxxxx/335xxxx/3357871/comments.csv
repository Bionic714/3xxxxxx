,carcass2,2005-07-19T22:54Z,"Do you people also believe in garden gnomes, trolls, elfs, the tooth fairy, santa claus and all that bullshit? Or are you just semistupid? Most people give up these childish fantasies when they reach the age of 10."
,slyenigma,2005-07-20T01:52Z,"Garden gnomes are plaster, tooth fairy isnt real, santa claus is based on a real person from germany and bull shot comes from cows.. Who knows trolls and elves resemble modern day aliens, maybe they said elves and trolls, but we say greys and aliens.

The fact that there are aliens shouldnt be a question.. With out a doubt somewhere there is life in the known universe.. wether they visit us is the real question.

Take a look into string theory and multi-dimensional theory. I think there are calculations for up to 29 dimensions vs our known 4 dimensions, including time.

It really lets humans know how very little we do know about the world we live in."
