Burning copy-protected DVDs requires 3 different applications that work together:

1. RipIt4Me
2. DVD Decrypter 3.5.4.0
3. DVDFab to split large DVD files (only required if file is larger than 4.5GB)

It will take time but it's worth it. Drop me a line if you don't succeed. olav66"

This download has awesome features, runs just fine, no virus, u need Direct X 9.0 C & WMF 9 to run. The same can be downloaded from pirate bay. 

Thanks Pirate Bay :- ) "
,staticmaker,2006-09-26T04:17Z,"to rip and burn dvds. you must use software that will remove the/bypass the copyright protection. one of the best i've found is ""dvdshrink"". not ALL dvd's can be ripped but many can."

,rh128592,2008-03-05T03:50Z,"Had problems running the keygen.  On one computer it said ""file in use"".  On another computer it said ""no permission..."".

Bummer..."
,choada777,2008-03-11T04:26Z,Keygen did not work (Vista).
,iusedtobecooltoo,2008-03-25T19:59Z,"O.k. so everything is working fine for me. the keygen was fine, no viruses, and registration worked. But when I try and watch a movie the windvd startup box never go's away, when I maximize the player it covers the box, but my video is choppy and it frezzes every few seconds. Anyone got any suggestions???"
,iusedtobecooltoo,2008-03-25T20:10Z,"oh. o.k. if anyone else has that same problem then just go into the file folder in windows explorer and find and delete the images named splash. it fixed everything, smoth play, no anoying box. THANX FOR THE UPLOAD!"
,SAM2908765,2008-04-14T18:29Z,No Problems . Great download .Thanks.
,fresh.easy,2008-05-11T18:45Z,When downloading this received a malicious file titled Mal/Packer. Spy Sweeper didn't know what it was... but it rated it a 5/5 security threat. The program and crack run fine... but if you don't want the Mal/Packer I'd suggest not installing the crack tool.
,makapa7,2008-06-15T13:57Z,"winxp and vista
pc user since 1995

no nfo file to show what to put in the keygen

no HD playback, try looking in index, no wording of it in the help index.
doesnt play in hidef as stated.

keygen doesnt work as no info for use of.

deleted immediately as its only for a trial period
all in all badly thought out and lack of working keygen does it no good at all."
,IamMorphious,2008-06-22T06:46Z,Ok ... to set it staight .. Avast pick up a Trojan on the Keygen program ... that is the call ..

,speed2fly,2008-12-02T22:37Z,witch filtype is It? And how to unpack? ExtractNow or. 
,FlankerB,2008-12-20T13:39Z,"to b5rr5en
All you need is DVDFab Platinum (the latest possible version). Even if you don't want to use
it for burning, it still is a great program (you can shrink an entire DVD9 to DVD5 (DL to SL), copy only main movie with audio and subtitle tracks of your choosing, customize (copy all parts including menus, but selecting audio and subtitle tracks), split into two SL DVDs (no quality loss), custom split (example movie on one dvd, special features on the other)). It also can rip into XVid, MP4, 3gp, and other formats for portable video players, PS2, PS3, XBOX360, cellphones, etc. If you are trying to copy a DVD from another dvd region, you should use AnyDVD in combination with DVDFab, or DVDshrink."
