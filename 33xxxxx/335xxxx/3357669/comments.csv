,HebrewHammer,2005-07-22T21:18Z,The quality is excellent and Family Guy Rules! But does anyone know why there are 12 different rar files when they all contain the same thing?!!
,Rewt528491,2005-07-22T22:12Z,"They dont, they're all fragments. Obviously when he used WinRAR he broke the 185mb file into 16 fragments, and if you didnt know when you click on the first RAR file WinRAR ""compiles"" all the contents in the 16 files together into one file. They all may appear to be the same thing but they really arent."
,Rewt528491,2005-07-22T23:37Z,Btw how come when I play it I hear sound but no video?
,larremannen,2005-07-23T17:50Z,must i upload it before i can open it?
