Soccer's Secret Agents. 

The second of two Money Programme specials looking at the Football Industry.

WIth the "Beautiful Game" increasingly becoming less and less of a sport and more and more of a business, this Money Programme special looks at the complicated realities of the Beautiful Game.

This second programme investigates football agents, now perceived as the game's major powerbrokers. The programme examines the often controversial financial dealings involved in negotiating player transfers, and also looks at the agents' own substantial fees.

Although this programme was originally broadcast in 2003, it is highly topical with Gary Lineker recently taken to the High Court over his comments in the press concerning transfer fees and the involvement of agents.
