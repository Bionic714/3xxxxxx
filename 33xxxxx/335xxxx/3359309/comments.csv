,Khono,2008-10-15T03:59Z,"Your problem, colombiano80, is that you're posting a question in a torrent that's very old and not particularly active.  But if anyone wants some advice with a similar situation, try closing our bittorrent and opening again.  If that doesn't work, try forcing a data-recheck.  The methods for that depend on what client you're using.  If it still doesn't work, close the torrent, move the files you got to a different folder to save 'em, then try downloading it all again.  You can also try downloading the torrent file again.  That's helped me sometimes, I think.  Finally, the only other thing I can think of is to recommend patience."

,Merik2013,2010-07-24T20:42Z,oh that's just swell. I'm at 63.3% and both the peer and the seeder that I was connected to disconnect as soon as the peer reaches 100%. now all I got is a seeder who's internet connection is so terrible that he struggles to even put out a single kilobyte a second. where's the justice in the world?
