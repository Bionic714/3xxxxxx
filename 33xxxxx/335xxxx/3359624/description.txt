Luc Bessons little masterpiece from 1997 with Bruce Willis and Milla Jojovich. I don't usually like this kind of film, and was very sceptical about it but honestly - it ownz :P Too many great moments to count. Favourite one is probably still when the huge matllic-y alien stomps up to the archaeology professor, who - trying desperately to understand what it is he is seeing - asks the only question any intellectual could think of had it happened to them in the 1940s "Are... are you... German!?" :-D

Little over 210MB, encoded cropped WS @ 175kbps video and mono sound. I.e. not for the home theater system, but great for a limited PocketPC memory card.

PM me if you're into that sort of thing, I know I am :-)

Peace,
