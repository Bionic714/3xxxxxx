,Stein82,2005-07-10T17:35Z,I just discovered that there already is another dvdr-torrent for Nausica채. Do you want me to continue seeding anyway?
,Stein82,2005-07-11T22:27Z,Please don't just leave the torrent as soon as you've got the movie. Especially here in the start it would help if I weren't the only seeder.
,Arvixx,2006-01-20T22:46Z,"Great! Was looking for this. DVD, Japanese audio, english subs! Perfect!"
,raakkel85,2006-01-31T08:46Z,"Please seed! stuck at 99,2%  :C "
,mtparis,2006-02-05T23:41Z,"Problem with the torrent, or the movie to be exact. the last segment of the film is a copy of the first 15 minutes. the quality is great, but you can't see the end of the movie, it just starts over."

Not a problem here."
