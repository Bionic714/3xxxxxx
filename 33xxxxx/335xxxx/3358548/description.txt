Game Notes:

     ~~~~~~~~~~~

     

     I of The Dragon is an Action-RPG where the player takes the role of a 

     hero Dragon. The Dragon is young and must be matured in strength and 

     power through a levelling system that will reward the player with new 

     spells and skill upgrades. Play as one of three possible dragons, each 

     with their own unique abilities. Use spells and brute force to hunt down 

     and destroy the evil creatures that threaten the peaceful Nimoans. Defend 

     towns, build new ones. Create mountains or bring them crumbling to the 

     ground. Summon creatures to fight for you or rely on your own powers. Use 

     all means available to help in your quest to unmask the source of evil 

     that plagues the land.
