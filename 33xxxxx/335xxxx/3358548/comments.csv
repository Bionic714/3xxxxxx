,feskarN^^,2005-07-20T14:02Z,"ffs, why do you upload this torrent 2 times? stupid french guy -.-"
,lap87,2005-07-20T15:11Z,i'm swedish btw.. piss off if you don't like it... i upped another one because something fucked upp the Tracker protocol before i got to seed it... 
,some_guy,2005-07-20T19:53Z,Please Seed... and Thanks!
,spelguru,2005-07-20T21:06Z,"[ENG] What kind of connection do you, oh holy seeder, have?
[SWE]Vad för slags uppkoppling har du, o heliga distributör?"
,lap87,2005-07-20T21:13Z,jo.. jag har BBB 10/10... men ni är typ 300 som är på lilla mig.. men jag kan tyvärr inte se hur många det är som seedar i dagsläget... eftersom denna sidan inte har uppdaterats sen jag la upp den... 
,punishment,2005-07-20T21:59Z,"I would have to agree.

Detta kallar jag ICKE porr. Ladda inte ner detta och typ banna punishment eller nåt."
,lap87,2005-07-21T00:01Z,"You are welcome ;) , i just got kinda mad when i realised that the other torrent's language was not of this earth... and then i got kinda pissed off at myself when my first torrent was not working.. but now i know that i should use MakeTorrent to make my torrents... "
,lap87,2005-07-21T09:10Z,so.. now i think my work here is done :) according to BitComet there is over 31 seeds and counting.. have phun everybody and be sure to keep up the good work! 
,lap87,2005-07-21T12:40Z,"gawd.. now the game won't run either.. gahh, it just starts up leaves a blank screen and exits... anyone who could lend me some help?"
,lap87,2005-07-21T12:50Z,i found it out on my own.. it is the intro movie that's  fucking things up.. got to ProgramZuxxezThe I of the DragonDataVideoEnglish   and rename the intro movie to something else... pm me if you need help!
,Jegreen,2005-07-21T16:08Z,"Got it.. didn't get it to work however. I got a message when i tried to start the game up saying: Direct3D initialization error.

,Zyun,2005-07-24T10:07Z,"this looks like a cool game, i got it installed and everything, just one problem.. i can't understand this language.. is there a translate patch or something?"
,lap87,2005-07-24T15:08Z,Rasmekpeace - Did you kinda imply something there? because if you didn't know that this game is bi-lingual = both German and English then you should get your facts right first..
,lap87,2005-07-24T15:10Z,"Zyun - Well, if you don't understand english... sry can't really help you then :P"
,Zyun,2005-07-25T02:17Z,"sorry, i posted on the wrong torrent"
,Stitchz,2005-07-26T11:37Z,so is the game working for most of us now?  Just wanted to ask before I start d/l'ing.  I have XP if there's any known issues with it.
,lap87,2005-07-27T13:38Z,"No issues whatsoever, it's running perfectly on XP, if the game just suddenly quit while starting it up... read my other post here about that problem.. "
,talonsco,2005-07-30T18:51Z,"I couldnt get it working at all but d/led the myth version and that worked fine.  If your having problems with any access violations etc maybe give that a try.  I tried 3 different full versions and its the ripped one that works :p
