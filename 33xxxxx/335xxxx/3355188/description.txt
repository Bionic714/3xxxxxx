Yet another Volume in the excellent "Love, Peace & Poetry" series. This time it focuses on British psychedelic music, and no surprise - the music is all very very good, with a kind of "english" feel to it. Reminds me of The Iveys, Small Faces, Donovan, Procol Harum, Pink Floyd, early Bowie or The Who. This is a good compilation of music indeed. The next volume in the series will arrive at a bay near you shortly ^_^
