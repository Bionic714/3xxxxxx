From the ashes of the fires lit in the dog-fights of the skies above the carriage of World War One, a phoenix would rise - the Luftwaffe of the Third Reich.No ordinary force, the Luftwaffe was to become the handmaiden of Hitler's dream of conquest and a vital component of "Blitzkrieg" or "Lightning War".However the glories won in Poland, Scandinavia, Holland, Belgium and finally France, as the Nazis marched, victorious, through Europe, were to turn sour.The Fuehrer's continual demands upon his airforce, as he fanatically pursued his "Grand Design" forced the Luftwaffe into the role of workhorse, though incompetence, intrigue and greed amongst its commanders made the task near impossible.Starved of new planes and pilots to fly them, stretched across two fronts in Europe and playing a vital role in North Africa, Goering's elite corps was fatally flawed.This tragic story chronicles the initial brilliant succcess of the Luftwaffe in Europe, its structure and tactics and the inherent weaknesses that were to drag the phoenix once again to its inescapable consummation within the fires of Berlin.The story is told using very rare footage only recently obtained from the eastern block and not seen in the west since the war. - Scene Selection: 1.The Phoenix Rising 2.Spanish Opportunity 3.Poland 4.Bad Management 5.Operation Barbarossa 6.Tank Busters 7.One Last Time: - Special Features: Interactive Menu: 7 Scene Selections: 10 Excerpts From Other War File Titles
