,garryowen78,2012-01-23T23:29Z,"I'm very surprised this torrent is still active. The picture quality is inferior to the 1GB version available on piratebay, and the picture size has been greatly reduced, leaving a huge black space on three sides, with the subtitles outside the picture, at the bottom. This is an absurd way of doing subtitles, and destroys the film. I strongly recommend that users try one of the many alternative torrents of this film. "
