,Fishbeaver,2005-07-04T14:50Z,Oh! Thanks! This will be intresting to see:) Also thanks for the link on the bottom of the info to that torrent with missing songs from the official dvd...
,kingey,2005-07-05T11:47Z,No problems.  As I said do not expect it to be top quality due to it's age but it is still enjoyable.  Also I just saw I said it is in DIVX format which is what the original was.  This second seeding is actually VCD - sorry for the mixup.
,mycarrion2,2005-07-08T03:45Z,"Am I really on day 5 of this download?  Or is it 6?  I'm thankful for the prospect, but what gives?"
,mycarrion2,2005-07-09T02:50Z,"The statement was really aimed at the 34 that have received the files and have subsequently left.  And, in hopes that those who may finish this before me may find an ounce of conscience and stick around a while to help.

I did state that it had been many days, and I hadn't given up to that point, yes?  I'm quite aware of my options, but it seems your response to my concerns was a little off the mark.  ie. I'm not your problem, and you're not mine.  In fact I've been upping more than downloading for all of those days.

Regards."
