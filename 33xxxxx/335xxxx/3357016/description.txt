from imdb: 
"Black Legion" was editorial cinema of the first order and gave Bogart his first chance to play a character with real dimension since "The Petrified Forest." 

The film was a brutal portrait of the ruthlessness of vigilante mob action? Bogart had a most difficult acting assignment, that of a factory worker who becomes disenchanted when he loses out on an important job promotion and joins a hooded gang of "pro-American" malcontents (whose, grotesque initiation rites are a frightening visual highlight) to gain retaliation? 

Bogart's gradual moral disintegration as he becomes more and more involved in the illicit organization was a small-scale forerunner of the type of mental deterioration he was to later polish and perfect in "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" and "The Caine Mutiny." 

Under Archie Mayo's direction, Bogart interpreted the screenplay in an exemplary manner as he turned from a quiet, loving family man to a desperate human being?
