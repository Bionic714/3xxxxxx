,Grimmstone,2005-07-10T04:22Z,"Is this eliteweb release password protected?  If so, can someone post the password as their site is unreachable.  BTW - What is it with Spanish sites passwording their shit?"
,stans,2005-07-10T05:25Z,No password. Only solops2 has passwd.
,Grimmstone,2005-07-10T07:28Z,I had to be sure because I remember when I DLed Shadow Hearts: Covenant a couple of months ago when elitewebt3 had that up and it was passprotected.

,KDerrida,2006-02-18T04:37Z,"Hey, if anyone could reseed this for a little while, it'd be super. There are something like ten of us trying to get it right now. Most of us are at 88%. You could probably drop off in an hour or so."
