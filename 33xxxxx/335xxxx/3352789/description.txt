Recorded with ATI Radeon All In Wonder (analogue broadcasting) from Swedish television (SVT) – Swedish commentary. 

Video: 720 X 576 / 4:3 / variable bitrate approx. 3000 – 6000 kb/s / De-Interlaced / ATI video soap: Light

Audio: stereo 224 kbps / 16 bit 44 khz

Good looking “animated” menu with Live 8 logo as background and chapters. 

I had to do this menu a little bit different. Divided in two parts, "Part I" and "Part II". Swedish television jumped between their two channels during this event. It's not easy to make these DVDs out of four large mpeg-files. And on top of that they changed channel in the middle of songs. 

I had to make a transition in a Black Eyed Peas song (Where is the love). It looks good. 

You can start with Part I and then watch Part II. It works on my Pioneer DV-470.


Artist (songs):

Green Day (4)

I think this DVD is good if you like rock music. But next disc maybe better with Madonna, Snoop Dogg, Bon Jovi, Destinys Child, Brian Wilson and Annie Lennox and some more. It's finished but I seed disc 2 first. Maybe this disc 3 will be up this weekend.
