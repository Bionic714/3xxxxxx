And I know discs are a little bit undersized. I don't want to cut In middle of a artists perfomance to have exactly 4,4 gig."
,andibi,2005-07-06T12:06Z,"Hi Ritsch, thanks again, this time for disc 2. I already downloaded disc 1, even burned it to a DVD. The iso image plays perfectly from Daemon Tools using Media Player Classic and the DVD turns flawlessly from my Victor DR-MF3 player.  Hope everyone out there just stays cool and patient for you will all soon be rewarded with another beautifully crafted DVD from an excellent dude in Sweden. Cheers, andibi ... "
,Ritsch,2005-07-06T12:57Z,"Hallo andibi! Thank you for positive comments.

I forgot to say to you all that this is PAL Dvd (25 fps).

The only fault on disc 1 Is one short audio drop in the very beginning (intro, when old Live Aid images shown). This Is not a big thing and doesn't affect music.

,HSMistress,2005-07-06T16:57Z,Great! Going looking for your other disks. Many thanks for this post!!!
,marcush,2005-07-07T20:48Z,"These torrent are really GREAT Ritsch! Keep on going!! It would be wonderful if you could seed all the concert!
Can you burn the file to a DVD and then watch them on a DVD player and on the computer without burning it?"
,Ritsch,2005-07-07T22:02Z,"Burn It on a DVD-+RW and watch. If you like It burn on DVD-+.

I'm not using Daemon Tools but I think you can use that software to watch on computer without burning.

If you want best picture, watch on tv. I watch on a 32 inch CRT Philips (Pixel Plus). Good picture with these DVDs. "
