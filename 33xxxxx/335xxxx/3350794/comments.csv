,ollax,2005-07-01T08:39Z,"2.76 GiB means quality cant be good!
Prolly just the old one converted to dvd!"
,Scorpion187,2005-07-01T08:49Z,"YEAH! Hit Refresh Y'idiot! Smooth!!

P.P.S.
    Sound Quality is consistent 7/10 throughout
    Video Q. starts great, dips down to horrendous for the infamous 20 minutes, then ends on a high note!"
,Sulky,2005-07-01T09:13Z,Oh man!! why the effort?  
,Scorpion187,2005-07-01T09:28Z,"Well... after so many hours of work I did begin to feel that it may not be worth the effort... BUT a few hours earlier a unique form of dementia had already set in.. to the tune of ""Menu too good; Must be released; Must Create Worthy A/V; Repeat;""
Also due to financial burdens I missed out on seeing this Awesome Movie in theaters; so I had to have a DVD copy that I could watch without the sync errors driving me insane!"
,Xedexx,2005-07-01T13:02Z,"Why do ppl bother to download this ?? Its NOT a DVD release (not even close to it) Q sucks and sound sucks..nothing to do with ""DVD"" "
,Scorpion187,2005-07-01T17:29Z,"Like I told ya's, ppl ""bother"" to dl b/c it's the closest thing out there.  People who ""bother"" to dl the sinfamous DVD release will be dissapointed. If I'm not mistaken ppl who dl this will wonder how in the $@%! the menu was made and hold it above all other for being in sync.
And if I may rant a bit...
here is a simple premise to live by: The Playstation 2 is a DVD player; therefore, if you master a DVDR that doesn't play right in it, YOU DID NOT MAKE A DVD!
So by order of flawless execution in my PS2; I proclaim this to be the FIRST FULL FEATURED DVDR EVER."
,Cornflower,2005-07-01T19:11Z,"Thank you for your efforts. Personally, I'll wait for a retail copy, but nevertheless, I don't think you deserve the harsh words some people throw at you."
,themite,2005-07-01T23:06Z,"This has been made from sinfamous lose VOB files contained in the *.rar file with ultraiso or somilar, converted into a iso file.
Let me tell u, this is one big shitty hoax, the sinfamous. The quality is no way TeleCine, it is a CAM conversion into DVD format. The sync gets fucked after an hour or so, and there was a svcd release wich had this problem so 100% it is that release coverted. I stopped watching the movie when the sync problem started realizing i had been fooled, VERY hard to hear what they say, and image is full of square pixelation problems due to DVD conversion. IT SUX dont waste your time, and u definitively deserve harsh words for uploading , what i myself did a conversion of the VOB files to *.iso, because it is fucked all the way, bad picture, squares and bad contrast and it is TS NOT TC!!!"
,Scorpion187,2005-07-01T23:23Z,"Nice Massacre of the Language we've all agreed on (English) ...
Like I said if you read before you pecked on your keyboard this is a composite of all of the best cams out there; it uses no material from the sinfamous release; the sound is great on this one: from the POT cam I believe. I suggest if you want it to look good you burn it straight to DVD (preferably with mkisofs/dvdrecord; but Nero will do) and watch/enjoy it on a DVD PLAYER!!"
,dirtmound,2005-07-11T20:40Z,"This is awesome! Ok, there's some fan cam edited in to fill the hole and the Russian subtitle appears in the one subbed scene, but this is an  otherwise great bootleg. Let's be honest, bootlegs never quite match the original. But as bootlegs go, this is going to be hard to beat. 

FYI, I burned it with Nero, ignoring the warnings, and's it's playing just fine on my DVD player."
,DVD_PIRATE,2005-07-16T17:25Z,This is teh worst dvd verson i ewer seen.. it is so realy bad!! I recomend people not to download and whait for a nodder verson!!
,DVD_PIRATE,2005-07-16T17:27Z,"realy, it is so bad qualety that im not gonna seed at all!!"
,Scorpion187,2005-07-17T11:05Z,"NO PARTS ARE MISSING EXCEPT END CREDITS PPL!!!
fandango lists the movie has a runtime of 2 hrs. 14 min.
this release is 2:09!!!
""I burned all what I believed were the necessary files""???? Dude!!! When the real DVD comes out you MUST buy it and carfully cut out a 33% cross section of the disc... and play it in your DVD player :D! (All files are necessary AND it must be burned as DVD-Video; not just DVD)
MR_PIRATE: Constructive criticism is much preferred as opposed to outright slander... keep in mind what poor cams I had to sort through and tell me what is wrong with the DVD. Please don't tell me you only burned what you felt like :()."
,Hikiro,2005-07-18T09:10Z,Se ve como las weas 
,Bjorken,2005-07-19T23:06Z,"Thx for the release!

[V],Slickinator,2005-07-27T18:48Z,if having problem watching on computer go to www.cole2k.net and get a standard or advanced codec pack and then your set it will play in media player and so forth

""Get Off My NUTS!!"""
,KewK,2005-08-04T15:10Z,ziggydust du är ju för f*n dum i huvudet...hur faan pallar du bara bry dig om någon annans stavnig...tror du att du så jävla mycket bättre än alla andra eller? idiot!!
[M],Q91,2005-08-04T17:37Z,"Kewk: varför dryd du dig om att han bryr sig om någon annans stavning? du gör det inte mycket bättre. Anyways, to my real message; DVD_Pirate, why the bloody hell do you slander like that? Scorpion never said ""THIS THE SHIT YOU FUCK, IT IS REALLY A DVD"" Just because he made it into a DVD, doesnt meant it's DVD quality, people should learn that even original releases not always has the best quality (especially old movies converted to DVD tend to have sync problems or bad video quality, and m talkign about DVD's THATS BEING SOLD"

,Scorpion187,2005-08-12T07:43Z,"Oh geez... another idiot who didn't read all the info before jumping in for a nigh 3 Gig download...
The video quality falls down to horrible for the Infamous Twenty Minutes then returns back to the decent screener for the last hour.  YOU WON'T FIND A BETTER ONE UNTIL THE DVD IS RELEASED... ""Get off my NuTs!"""

,Scorpion187,2005-08-17T09:39Z,"Linux... Accept no substitues. How ironic is it that your only defense of Windows is to tell people to download GNU GPL Licensed software. That's right, GNU as in GNU/Linux, as in the open software system that gave birth to Linux.
BTW on top of all that, VLC is a killer App but still will not play the DVD files without menu rendering glitches... at least as far as the Windows version is concerned. ""Ain't nothin' like the real thang Baby!"""
,Scorpion187,2005-08-17T09:51Z,"Have no fear.... SONY is here!!
I realize that for many of you Linux is not yet a viable option due to the required expertise... You may not yet realize it but the ""against-everything wanna-be-revolutionary nerds"" of the world have been prepping a great gift for humanity. Software THAT WORKS!!! And while Fat-cats grow even more confident in their Software which doesn't, a Revolution is preparing to storm the gates. Legendary Software is about to be married with Unprecedented Processing Power.
