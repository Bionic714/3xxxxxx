 Reissue of this 1971 Japanese hard rock album, originally issued by Philips -- the one & only album by the duo of Shigeru Narumo and Hiro Tsunoda. Similar in style the group these two would form immediately thereafter: Flied Egg (also related in one way or another to: Jacks, Foodbrain, Sadistic Mika Band and Captain Hiro & Space Band). Narumo played guitars and organ, Tsunoda sang and played drums. The sound is a thunderous post-Purple mess of tubs, riffs and blues-approximation. The lyrics are sung in almost-English and most concern the illustrious concerns of "women" (at least they don't seem to use the word "lady"). "I Gotta See My Gypsy Woman" is the first track, "Women Called Yellow 'Z'" is the second, by the time you get to "Mary Jane On My Mind" you'll probably need to empty the tear-bucket.
