Can you still add ""rip"" in parenthesis or something if it's not a direct ISO copy?  And DVDR5 if it's a dual layer with things removed for a single layer...and hey by the way, thanks more than you can even know for seeding this.  I've been all over DC++ looking for this and it's quite an unpleasant process."
