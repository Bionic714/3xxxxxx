,mclorkus,2005-08-10T19:37Z,"Im 51.2 percent done with this download, I think this d/l has been going for at least two + weeks.  narnach! I make this plea to you! SUPER SEED THIS FILE! IT WILL GO M U C H FASTER!"
,kasseey,2005-08-10T21:13Z,LOL :/
,mclorkus,2005-08-11T01:09Z,"Every time someone picks up this torrent we have to wait for them to catch up to the percent we are at!  I could probably buy this game for 5 bucks, but I dont want to, narnach is a stupid ass whipe! thats all I have to say, IF YOUR GOING TO UPLOAD A FILE FOR PIRATEBAY, DONT BE A STINGY BASTARD ABOUT IT!"
,kasseey,2005-08-11T11:47Z,"Narnach: Idea is very well, but the way of realization is not so good. Instead of giveing us 1%/24h, you schould send us at least 10%/24h, than all of us can get file in real time.
 :) :)"
,mclorkus,2005-08-13T00:24Z,WELL HALLAYLOOOYAH I got five percent today already! I might get more if that asshole keeps it up.  Stupid prick narnach....

,UglyDucklingxyz,2008-03-02T14:18Z,"I haven't been able to find a crack for this game. Has anyone had any luck? 

JubilexPrime - how can I send you a private message?"
,Striker00,2008-04-09T13:59Z,"Ther No CD crack is right here:

http://m0010.gamecopyworld.com

Once you enter the site, on the right hand side you'll see a heading that says ""PC' and 'Game Index' under that. Select 'T-Z' and on that list is the Wheel of Time game. Click on that and it will take you to a page that has the No-CD crack (make sure you select the U.S english one). After you download the crack, follow the instructions and you're done. It won't ask you for the second disk anymore and the game will play just fine. I downloaded it yesterday and it works great."
,centime,2008-09-29T03:12Z,"Thank you, Striker00, for the link to the crack, and for providing instructions.  It is very nice of you to do that.  Saves on a lot of stress poking around to find things and figuring out what to do.

Nice one :)"
,centime,2008-09-29T21:37Z,"Okay, after downloading this over a few days, I tried to extract the files from the zips, but they were corrupt.  Fine - sometimes they get fouled up during downloading.  So I downloaded them again... Same thing.

What gives, narnach?  Have you done anything that would affect this download?  After downloading it twice, it would be nice to have the fucking thing work.

Can you please respond to your comments?  Or did you ever intend to?  I'm sorry for sounding nasty, but don't just put up a torrent and then when people have questions for you, ignore them.

I know some people were nasty to you in the earlier comments, but you didn't respond to them either.  You might not care if anyone downloads your torrents - because I won't any more - but its not very sportsman-like (or pirate-like) to just leave people hanging.

My two cents.

Now, anything about the corrupt files?"
,elsem88,2010-04-05T15:37Z,"This doesnt work. Tried unzipping, but there are no files, so im not gonna waste trying to burn it on a CD since there are more comments on this. Dont waste time dl'ing it"
,hobgoblin1234,2011-02-06T14:32Z,"Can any1 seed plz??
Love the books, cant wait på play the game!!"
,bloodmonster,2012-03-15T19:37Z,"i followed what Striker00 suggested, but i get a message that 'input is not supported'.. :( anyone any idea please?"
,bloodmonster,2012-03-18T21:14Z,"blantman i did the same, the problem was with my pc.. on my laptop it's running fine, only the sound is strange a little, but i think i can live with that as long as the game is good:)"
