,brain3k,2005-07-27T20:12Z,"I think your problem bigkyle is you don't have Xvid codec installed. Get that shit in and you'll be fine. And don't forget windows media player classic. On win2k win media player 6.4 was my favorite- played everything with no bullshit. It just kills me I can't use it on winXP, so MPC isn't too bad a replacement. 
Anyhow, thanks for the upload TPZ, this is some funny shit. "
