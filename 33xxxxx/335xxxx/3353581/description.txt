Civilization 3 is among my favorite strategy games of all time. It not only had so much diversity, but it had an excellent system installed for its turn-based action. This time around, Sid Meier has moved Civilization 4 and Firaxis under the publisher wing of 2k games. Debuting this time around include a new 3D engine that should excite those hardcore Civ fans. Not only that but modding will be even easier this time around and people should have fun making their own games and maps.

To all Civilization nerds.. some pictures and trailers! Have fun :) *Loves the Addiction Trailer*
