Walt Holcombe lives in Los Angeles and works on the fringe of the animation industry. Walt is very happy (and lucky, quite frankly) not to be a telephone solicitor. He created The King of Persia with the help of a Xeric grant in 1996 and put out the 4 part series, Poot, for Fantagraphics in 1998. In 2001, he animated and directed the "The Courtship of Sniffy LaPants", which can be seen at http://sniffpants.com. Some of the animation is a little doubtful, but he still kind of likes it. The music is brilliant, at any rate.

Musicians from the same tango orchestra of "Waking Life", even! His latest work, "Hails at Sea", yet another scathing self-portrait, is a loose narrative of dreams from 1998 - 2004. Walt hopes to become a real craftsman one day; a cobbler or a cooper, perhaps.
