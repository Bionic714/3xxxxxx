==notes
This is an English distribution of the game. All music, sfx and speech is included. This is an ORIGINAL CD rip, there are no additional files added to the images. This game was originally printed on 90Minute CDs, in order to burn the game you will need a 90Minute CD (I would just reccommend mounting the cd using a virtual drive using daemon tools (http://www.daemon-tools.cc)

enjoy!
