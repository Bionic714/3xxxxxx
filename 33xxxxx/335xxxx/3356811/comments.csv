,SacRe,2005-07-16T06:37Z,"What exactly do you need to do when burning psx/ps2 games, do you just burn the .rar as NTSC or do you take the files out of the rar and burn them that way?"
,SacRe,2005-07-16T06:39Z," If someone could let me know that would be apperiated, I loved this game but someone decided they'd steal it from me awhile ago lol."
,alcows,2005-07-16T19:38Z,You do not burn the rar. You extract the files then use a program such as Clone CD or Alcohol 120% to burn the files onto a CD-R. It is very important that you burn these files at the LOWEST possible speeds because otherwise your PSX games may contain skipping errors or freeze at certain points.

,alphaw0lf,2007-09-10T02:53Z,"Cmon people, almost 2k downloads and only 5 seeders? I'll share when it's finished."
,gelenisse,2007-11-03T01:19Z,"assholes, how the fuck can it be so hard to seed?"
,elereyese,2007-12-30T16:46Z,"hey cutemale are you still stuck there?
anyway, I played it like 3 times so far so i think i could help anyone...
to ""fly"" just jump over the fan and press the button you use to grab your spoiled wings (you OBVIOUSLY have done that if you have reached that far)  this will make you ascend to the next level..."
