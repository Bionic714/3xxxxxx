INFO:

Namco and Capcom team up for this crossover simulation RPG -- hence the title Namco X Capcom, pronounced in Japanese "Namco Cross Capcom."

Both companies provide characters from their huge game catalogue, allowing the likes of Ryu, KOS-MOS, Gilgamesh, Lei-Lei and more to fight together. Stages begin with a dialogue sequence as the characters confront one another, then proceed to grid-based battles. When you target an opponent, the game switches to a side-view attack sequence where button inputs determine the moves that your characters perform.
