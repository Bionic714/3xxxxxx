The full European Parliament press conference after the 2005-07-06 vote on software patents (DIVX, 48 minutes).

It's very interesting because it shows that the MEPs really know what this is all about and most of them have a position surprisingly similar to the FFII (http://swpat.ffii.org/)!
Josep Borrell (EP President) and Michel Rocard (MEP) speak very clearly about what's wrong with software patents, the Council of the European Union, the European Commission, Microsoft, etc.

Unfortunately the first 4 minutes are only translated in Italian, but all the important things are in English.
