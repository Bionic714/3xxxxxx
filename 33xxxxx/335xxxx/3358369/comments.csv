i dont have a clue how to do it"
,Huith,2008-01-15T15:43Z,"installed OK ran fine. Great crack thanks.

unzip all files. run the PSP installation program. check prog installed ok. then shut down program and run the 'Paint Shop Pro (v.7.04) Crack' file. direct it to the folder where the program is (usually C:/program files). crack installs automatically and when you open PSP again you should find a fully working program without nag screen."
,2loseit,2008-02-08T15:56Z,"I don't want to sound like an idiot, but I've read the helpful comments left on how to open this program, I still can't get the ""Trial Version"" of Jasc Paint Shop Pro to ""become the cracked/torrents version"".  I'm now on the 7th day of the trial version though.  If I go past the trial will I still be able to have it work to assist in getting the permanent ""cracked"" version to work?  If it's too hard to explain to a PC-dum-dum like myself, then don't bother.  Hopefully I'll figure it out...trial & error, trial & error.... thanks!"

It states that it has installed OK - but PSP still displays the 'try and buy' caption. Then - after the trial period - the software stops working and displays that you have gone over the trial period.
Therefore it would appear that the crack is useless and you may as well simply download the try & buy version from the Jasc site."
