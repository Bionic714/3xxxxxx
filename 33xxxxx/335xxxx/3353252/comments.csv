Australia is one of, if not the, strongest US ally. They didn't even accept the Kyoto protocol since their Master didn't"
,Temptation,2005-07-10T08:19Z,"I'm not Australian, but you guys should realize that the Australian citizens were absolutely NOT in favour of the Iraq war.. but like the citizens of England, they were dragged into it in a display of utter contempt for democracy by their lying, self-serving, Bush ass-kissing puppets leaders, i.e, John Howard and Tony Blair of Australia and England, respectively.  There were big protests  in both countries by the citizens against the Iraq war.  The only reason both countries have subsequently re-elected the leaders they despise for dragging them into the Iraq war is that there were no credible alternatives in either country.  In Australia, the government was doing a good job with the economy, so people voted the John Howard government back in, despite their disagreement about the Iraq war.  Australians absolutely hate America as a result of this.. in fact, American students planning to go to Australian universities to study are being warned about the level of ""anti-Americanism"" that the ozzie students are apparently displaying.

In England, the Conservatives were even bigger war-hawks and also supported the Iraq war .. so Tony Blair's Labour was the only credible choice.  That's what politics has come to these days - no fucking choices.. either you vote for a lying, piece of shit, Bush ass-kissing puppet like Tony Blair.. or you vote for the Conservatives, who are even further to the right, and even bigger war hawks.  And this is what is celebrated as wonderful ""democracy"" in the world today.

In fact, was there even one fucking single country in the much touted ""coalition of the willing"" whose citizens were actually willing when it came to the Iraq war? England... Australia.. Italy.. Spain.. Poland etc.. Every fucking one of those countries who joined the great ""coalition of the willing"", had citizens who were extremely unwilling to join Dubya and his clan of Neo-Cons in his imperial adventure. And for everyone of those countries, it was the leadership who dragged their countries into the war against the wishes of their citizens.. How utterly undemocratic.. As Noam Chomsky said in one of his speeches, the contempt for democracy displayed by the Bush administration was incredible... Countries that respected their citizens' wishes to not go to war in Iraq, i.e., France and Germany, were scorned as ""Old Europe"" .. while countries that refused to listen to their citizens and forcefully dragged their countries into the Iraq war were touted as ""New Europe"" and congratulated. Kind of ironic isn't it.. that all these countries were dragged into the war in a thoroughly undemocratic fashion despite the wishes of their citizens 
by their corrupt, self-serving, lying leaders (that lying fucker Tony Blair, John Howard of Australia, Italy's corrupt Berlusconi) who were promised bribes and favours and a piece of the oil and economical pie in Iraq by the Bush adminstration.. to fight a war that apparently was to ""bring democracy"" to a country."

i completely agree, i took part in protest rallies as did 1.2million other australians in the week before our respective retard governments plunged dick first into iraq. 

i know that the same day millions in NYC and London did same, and that the governments were blind to it as - extremists... not representative of public opinion -  dont know about NYC and London, but 1.2 million is a respectable proportion (what, maybe 9%?) of australia's total population. 

to get this turnout at a demonstration, there must have been at least twice as many who disagreed with the war but didnt attend the demonstrations.

anyway, my main issue is that while Blair appears to represent the left wing of british politics, thus there is no alternative side that may be against licking Bush's almost defunct crack, Howard represents Australia's Right wing conservatives, and HE STILL WON THE 2004 FEDERAL ELECTION. it makes me cry, but as stated this is because a) his financial management was percieved as positive - though he was selling the farm and b) the left wing alternative at the time had no strong platform re: war on iraq and in fact was without strong platforms on most issues. thus, the war effort rolled on for australia.

anyway, SEED THIS TORRENT. it is important.

hehe "
