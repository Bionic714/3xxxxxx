,apc,2005-07-06T10:01Z,Is this legit?  i thought the new episode (Neighbors) was supposed to air this coming Sunday.
,gregersamsa,2005-07-06T11:03Z,The 4th episode has already aired and is available. But the 5th? Only one way to find out ;-)
,illyrian,2005-07-06T11:23Z,"It's legit, my word on it, whatever that's worth, though this one is far from being the greatest episode."
,gregersamsa,2005-07-06T11:26Z,"It's the real deal allright ;-) Man, I never liked Leonardo di Caprio before, now I really hate they guy! He's messing with my man Vince!

,Gorogoro,2005-07-06T15:39Z,"Episode 4 isn't posted on piratebay, I used the search word ""Entourage"" and it's not there. Anyone know where I can find it?"
,Gorogoro,2005-07-06T22:19Z,"Yeah, that would be great =)

How do you post torrents by the way?"
,illyrian,2005-07-06T22:25Z,I'll post it later tonight if you still want it.
,illyrian,2005-07-06T23:25Z,"Sorry about the double post, my bad.

I've uploaded the torrent for Episode 4 @ http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3353061

Re: Uploading a torrent.

,maddcamel,2005-07-12T07:23Z,"Yeah man, I have been trying to download Entourage Season 2 Episode 6 and when I try to click on it, my computer says file not recognized. What's up with that?"
,Oakroad_Slim,2006-01-07T11:16Z,"It would be very convenient with a tad of seeding on this one, just a little minute or two."
