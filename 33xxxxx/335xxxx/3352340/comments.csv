,nofind222,2005-07-05T07:12Z,"I had some settings wrong on my end regarding 
this file, it's actually seeding pretty well now.
Sorry for the hold-up.."
,Terz,2005-07-06T15:09Z,"Would be nice with a included readme file, that told you what tools/programs to use."
,nofind222,2005-07-07T03:46Z,"Uhh, no, I removed only the files that were either
garbled, and stuff my virus scanner said was 
infected, if I can recover the readme files, I'll see 
about posting them. No guarantees though.."
