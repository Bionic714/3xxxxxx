,grap3,2005-07-12T21:36Z,Thank you for DOA3.2! 
,leeloo5,2005-07-15T17:23Z,"I'm happy to help.  as another note, heres some info on DOA3.2:

3.2 also includes modifications to many moves and adds new tactics to the game as well as slight changes to the graphics for the better.

I am told that it's like playing a whole new DOA although I am not too good so I can't really tell.

USA DOA3 = 3.0
JAPANESE DOA3 = 3.1
UK DOA3 = 3.2

3.1 is very similar to 3.2 although there are some changes to 3.2. I am told this is the DOA to have, too bad it wasn't released in the US."
