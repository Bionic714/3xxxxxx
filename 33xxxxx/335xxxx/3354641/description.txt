The PAL version of DOA3 not only comes with the added costumes that were available in the US only as a bonus disk add on, but also comes with a new opening video and 50 new moves.

I have Removed the ending videos for each character in order to make the file size considerably less.  This will not effect the game and when those videos are attempted to be played, the screen will just turn black.


torrent also comes with 100% complete gamesave from xboxsaves.com as well as my custom default.tbn thumbnail that will work in programs like XBMC.
