About Mixcraft:

Recording and mixing audio on your computer used to be a task for the professional studio jock equipped with the fastest desktop and complicated software. Nowadays, Mixcraft Multitrack Studio provides an excellent starting point for new users and DJs looking for a simple way to record audio, mix multiple tracks, make edits, and apply effects. We like the spacious and well-designed interface, which lets you record audio files through your computer's sound card or drag and drop them into the time line. Afterwards you'll find a built-in tool for burning your tunes to CD. The program opens and saves to uncompressed WAV files as well as to MP3, WMA, and OGG. You can pencil in volume, pan, or filter changes, and the program provides a loop editor. The included real-time effects work well, and include such standbys as compression, distortion, and EQ. You'll even find a filter for shifting pitch. Though its small learning curve and minimal features make Mixcraft Multitrack Studio ideal for beginners, pros may find it useful as an audio sketch pad or for quick demos.

There was another torrent out there for this one, but very weak support.  I'll seed for 7-14 days to get the traffic up.
