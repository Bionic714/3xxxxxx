The ""nfo"" is very unclear but you should be able to figure it out."
,kronchev,2005-07-12T19:51Z,"Can someone please tell me while this is downloading, is this compatible on the same stick as other games? I have Coded Arms, Lumines, and Dead to Rights all on a 1 gig stick (with over 500 megs free!), but I can't put any of the other rips on the stick as it will screw with one already on...those 3 all use different methdos to load (CA uses a boot from the root of the mem stick, lumines and DtR AFAIK each use a special loader)"
,parabolee,2005-07-13T17:17Z,"Place the prx folder (from PSP_GAME) in the mem card root common/prx.

So if your Mem Card drive is H it would be -

H:/common/prx"
,parabolee,2005-07-13T21:58Z,"Has the web browser been deactivated on this?

It doesnt work for me, when I select ok it just goes back to the menu.

Damn shame because I only wanted this for the web browser."
,raiderzfreak5380,2005-07-16T00:02Z,WHat is prx?
,maxether,2005-07-18T09:07Z,"Please help

,maxether,2005-07-18T09:08Z,Can anybody make a list of 256MB Stick Games?
,masterblast,2005-07-18T17:33Z,Where do u put the files? have moved /PRX to common. 
,Arucard,2005-07-19T02:17Z,"Can't get it to work... it loads and then it says ""Starting game..."" but nothing happens :( anyone gotten it to work? if so, plz tell me how you did it!"
,Arucard,2005-07-19T02:25Z,"Sorry, had a ""dubble"" PSP_GAME dir... working now"
,REVOS,2005-07-19T12:57Z,"Damn! I cant get the game to start. Ive done everything right. Ive copied the PSP_GAME folder to the root of MS (G:/PSP_GAME) and ive also copied  the PRX files in the PSP_GAME folder to a folder called Common (G:/common/prx) The Wipeoutnoumd and Wipeoutnoumd% folder ive copied to the PSP/GAME folder (ive also tried to skip these folders). When i start the game it says ""starting game"", and then the SONY ENTERTAINMENT text/logo shows up. After that a white screen with some text and pictures is shown. The text says ""Racing League"" or something like that and at the top there are some orange colored bars that are moving. then nothing happens."
,REVOS,2005-07-19T13:06Z,OK now i got this game to work...i downloaded a loader/launcher
