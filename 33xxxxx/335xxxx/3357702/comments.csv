Thank You!!"
,jaquett,2006-05-17T17:15Z,Someone please consider seeding this!
,Elysiuminator,2006-05-23T16:20Z,"Thanks for really penetrating movie. But...
I've downloaded 99% and stuck there for weeks. Would someone be so kind to seed for a while?"
,tony_olsson,2006-07-28T08:23Z,"Please, pleease, seed this!!"
,interbat,2006-08-27T20:43Z,cool :)
,emanuelc666,2006-11-02T10:44Z,"Does anybody have any of his other films.  Silver 
Globe, etc.  "
,larslande,2007-04-11T14:36Z,"WARNING: The aspect ratio is WRONG on this movie. If you use a standalone player for DIVX the picture is stretched in height... the persons look very thin indeed! Only way was to drag the window on PC playback, but then it would not cover my desktop...

Please upload correct aspect ratio for standalone  DIVX DVD players!"
,larslande,2007-04-11T14:37Z,"And yes, I have tried 4:3, 16:9 and original setting on PC playback, it is still wrong..."
,scrantonian,2007-07-02T00:02Z,i don't know about everyone else but the rip i dl'd was pretty terrible  - artifacts galore - extremely annoying to watch. (maybe its just me).
,flobie11,2007-08-03T10:45Z,"For those of us that now have seen this uncut version and LOVE the movie...

...is there anyone out there that can up the 'butchered US release (less than 90mins)' ??

Even if only a (decent) VHS rip exists, people that are REALLY into this movie should enjoy having both edits. Thanks!

This is one of a handful of movies that I can honestly say changed my life.

,fedocable,2008-02-08T19:11Z,"Thanks for this one! Freakyflicks is making me miss a little bit less our beloved late Demonoid, God bless its soul!"
,Bethlehelle,2008-02-14T12:21Z,"thank you for sharing this 
very strange movie"
,ArtCore,2008-02-29T13:57Z,"Is this 1 also dubbed?
thanks..."
,E.P.I.C.,2009-01-15T03:40Z,"is this the uncut version?
there is an other torrent that clearly says that is ''uncut''..
plz answer"
,guiriloco,2009-01-21T14:12Z,"man alive! read the torrent info before you post! it couldn't be clearer: ""this is the full, uncut 123 minute version"". ok?"
,MissLisa,2009-01-28T23:52Z,seeders please?
,DuffPaddy,2010-07-14T16:07Z,"Many thanks! I just got a Greek DVD of this from eBay, but the soundtrack is in French, so I\'ll download this to see if I can mix in the English audio. However, mine is neither the 90-minute \'butchered\' release nor the full 123-minute version described above: it weighs in at 118? minutes. But we\'ll see how it goes."
,DuffPaddy,2010-07-18T19:10Z,"Turns out my 118.5-min version contains the same content as this, but this one plays about 4% faster - maybe due to some PAL/NTSC conversion along the way...?

This version has cropping and aspect ratio issues, so I've mixed the video from my Greek DVD with the audio from this one. The results seem pretty good: decent picture and sound and both in sync. If there's any interest I'll upload my version, which will probably the best we'll get until the movie is properly released. I'll have to do some work though, as my version is now an 8GB MPEG, and I've been unable to re-encode it as XviD without losing the audio along the way."
,d-pad,2010-10-11T09:41Z,"hey Possession fans! been over 5 years since I upped this rip here for all y'all FREAKYFLICKs fans... and as commented on there are a few issues with this rip.
I've since re-ripped it using the H264 codec, at a 1.37Gb size, including directors commentary on a dual audio track - it is now in the correct AR and looks and sounds beautiful!
I won't be uploading it here, so if you want it you'll have to sign up at CINEMAGEDDON.NET (where you'll also find the ""butchered US cut"" upped by a fellow CG user :)"
