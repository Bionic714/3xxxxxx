one of my all time favourite "freaky flicks"... i am proud to present to you Andrzej Zulawski's "POSSESSION"!!!
this is the full, uncut 123 minute version. if you ever saw the butchered US release (less than 90mins!!!) don't be put off - this is a great film.
Isabelle Adjani is fantastic in this, and gives the performance of her career. Sam Neill is also great, but sadly outshone by Adjani.

enjoy =)

Do you like really fucked-up, weird flicks? Cool! Do 'symbolic metaphors' give you a tingle? Does the Name David Lynch mean anything to you? Do you watch movies *just* because you can't pronounce the director's name? Join the CLUB! 

But, are you worthy of the title 'uploader of a *really* far-out movie'
