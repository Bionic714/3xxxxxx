Bosnia

Ben Anderson travels to the former Yugoslavia as the national football teams of two countries that fought a genocidal war only ten years ago meet on the football pitch for the first time, in the qualifying rounds for the World Cup.

Political and racial tension spill onto the pitch as the Serb team travels to Sarajevo to play Bosnia Herzegovina. Violence on the terraces marked the beginning of the civil unrest that eventually led to the worst ethnic conflict in Europe in 40 years. A decade on, the animosity between the Serbs and Bosnian Muslims is as strong as ever. With almost every family touched by tragedy, will the fans be able to contain their passion to the stadium, or will it explode into violence? 

Contains very strong language.
