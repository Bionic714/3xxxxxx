This is a live concert clip of Gorillaz performing the song 'Clint Eastwood'.
The clip starts with the camera zooming in on a freestanding movie screen showing 2D's silhouette. 2D then 'steps forward' into the lights and gains color and an unusual three-dimensional appearance. The other band members then appear on their respective screens and the song starts.The whole illusion is weird and delightful, and reminds me of the effects in "Nightmare Before Christmas". If you're a Gorillaz fan, you need to see this. It's trippy. 
The clip also features two live Asian rappers performing onstage and a few shots of dancing audience members. 
The clip has a TV station watermark in the upper left-hand corner that reads "China Plus", but it is small and unobtrusive. I'm assuming it was broadcast on TV. This clip may be from the Gorillaz DVD 'Celebrity Takedown', but I don't know for certain.
