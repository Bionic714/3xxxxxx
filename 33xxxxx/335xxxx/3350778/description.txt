Lumines for PSP. Only 32 Megs, No load times.

To load game simply copy files to your memory stick and put ANY umd in your psp and start the game from the game menu. Music has been removed since it doesnt work in the first place and takes up over 160mb of space. Confirmed to work on 32mb stock memory sticks. Enjoy.
