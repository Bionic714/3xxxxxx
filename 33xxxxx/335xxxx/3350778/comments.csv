Wait for a clean one."
,n0friends,2005-07-01T08:48Z,does this really work? how do i do it?
,Ramis,2005-07-01T12:11Z,"How do use this:
On your memory card, put both the ""PSP_GAME"" folder and ""UMD_DATA.BIN"" in the root (so if the psp is d: on your computer it will be D:PSP_GAME and D:UMD_DATA.BIN

The GAME folder is put inside a PSP folder under you memory card. So it will look like this:
D:PSPGAMELuminesMS
D:PSPGAMELuminesMS%

Now you can run lumines under Game/Memory Stick in your PSP. One of the folders (LuminesMS) will look corrupted but its supposed to be that way. If you want to hide it rename the folders this way:
""D:PSPGAMELuminesMS""
-> ""D:PSPGAMELUMINES                         orz""
""D:PSPGAMELuminesMS%""
-> ""C:ChristofferLUMINE~1%""

it may look retarded but it will hide the corrupted file in your psp."
,craigweb,2005-07-01T12:52Z,"Followed your instructions Ramis, but on my PSP (ver 1.0 Firmware) it shows Lumines in the Memory Stick sub-menu of 'Game', and when I click to load it it shows the PSP rainbow animation, the screen goes black for a few seconds, then it jumps back to the main menu..."
,madakralc,2005-07-01T12:53Z,can i use this with psp ver 1.51
,mattdurrant,2005-07-01T12:59Z,"Hi there, has anyone found it possible to run this on any other card OTHER than the 32MB? as i have a 256MB"
,craigweb,2005-07-01T13:01Z,>>can i use this with psp ver 1.51
,craigweb,2005-07-01T13:01Z,"Not with 1.51, no."
,Ramis,2005-07-01T13:07Z,No you must do as i said... dont put everything in the root.
,madakralc,2005-07-01T13:09Z,"do you guys think its ever going to play games on ver 1.51 --->
cause i have 1.52 ;(..."
,Ramis,2005-07-01T13:11Z,"Yes you can use it on any memory card 32 meg or more... I use a 1Gig Sandisk.

This release is made for version 1.5 which need this 2 folders under PSPGAME... if you have 1.0 you may need the original launcher (only 1 folder)... i think it can be downloaded from http://www.ps2nfo.com/"
,Ramis,2005-07-01T13:13Z,"1.51 and 1.52 will be cracked eventually. Too bad you upgraded though. Or maybe it was that when you bought it.

For now homebrew ONLY work on 1.0 and 1.5."
,deptrai_steve,2005-07-01T13:34Z,"this works great, shame about the sound, but such is life..  hope to see many more games being able to run off memory stick"
,mattdurrant,2005-07-01T13:35Z,ok call me a dumb ass but i STILL cant get this to run. i have v1.0 and a sony 256MB card. HELP!?
,Ramis,2005-07-01T15:19Z,"Before you try to hide the corrupted file in your PSP, try to get the game working first!"
,Ramis,2005-07-01T15:20Z,"Ok as i said... This release might not work on 1.0... you should get another version!

BUT DO NOT UPGRADE"
,Ramis,2005-07-01T15:25Z,"For those of you who have 1.0!!!

Followed the instructions to the letter, running 1.50, just get an error message. Although my MS doesnt show corrupted data...strange."
