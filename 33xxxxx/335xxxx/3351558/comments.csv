,Tourniquest,2005-07-03T09:40Z,Not a DVD. Do not post it as such.
,Mopetimies,2005-07-03T11:02Z,"Jag har hört talas om ratDVD format, en full DVD som är komprimerad för snabbare överföringstid. Har ni erfarenheter av formatet? Blir det kvalitetsförluster eller inte?

""ratDVD takes a full featured DVD movie and puts it into a highly compressed .ratDVD container format file - while preserving all the features of the original DVD such as: 
-Full anamorphic picture, seamless branching, multiple video angles, multiple audio channels, subpictures, etc. 
-Keep movie versions (Directors Cut, Theatrical version, etc.), Alternate story endings, making of, video commentary , cut scenes, etc.. 
-Keep complete menus, navigation and features 
-Reliable high quality, valid check-summed container. 
You can also convert a .ratDVD file back to DVD format, burn it to a DVDR and watch the movie using a regular DVD player."""
,Tourniquest,2005-07-03T18:18Z,ratDVD is in the early stages of development. So far the picture looks like crap and they are hardly playable in any media player.
,das_cronic,2005-07-04T03:14Z,I refuse to download and DVD fuxored by RAT. The reason DVD format is shared is QUALITY. Why bother with a DVD then if you're just going to compress the shit out of it.
