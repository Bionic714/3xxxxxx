In 1978, $20 million was stolen from a Detroit bank.
One of the robbers was caught, one was found dead,
and the third disappeared. The money was never found.
Seven years later, the robber who was caught was
released from jail.
He immediately went to Miami, only to be found dead
the next day. Now FBI agents Doug Bennet and Steve Forest
have been called in to investigate the case while posing
as Miami police officers. Somewhere in Miami the third
robber is hiding with his $20 million, and he has a
seven-year head start on the authorities.
