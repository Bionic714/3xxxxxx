I thought I'd post this, the very first torrent I've made.

I know there are two other versions availble.  However they have problems:

The DVD is GREAT, but it's a 4.35 GB download and there are hardly ever any seeders, it took me more than 2 weeks to download the file completely.  

The MOV file, while smaller in size is also smaller in quality, especially the audio which goes out of sync.

My version is of high quality, and a small enough size that it can be downloaded relatively quickly.  The audio stays in sync and the AVI format is much more widely used, and doesn't require Quicktime to view.

Enjoy!
