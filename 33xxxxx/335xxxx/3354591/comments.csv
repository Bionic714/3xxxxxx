,007bistromath,2007-07-31T22:05Z,"Everytime I look at this torrent on the site, it varies from 1-4 seeds, but I can't actually see any of them. All I've got is a pair of peers who have about a quarter of the file between them. I DMZ'd myself and am not having problems with any of the other torrents I'm currently running. What's the deal?"
,007bistromath,2007-07-31T22:12Z,"There we go! Nevermind.

Now if only the seeds had fatter pipes. ;_;"
,sayeo87,2007-08-08T01:23Z,"Yup, same problem here, after cracking when I run the program there's just a black screen and the program terminates itself after awhile."
,sayeo87,2007-08-08T14:35Z,"Aahhhh! After a whole day of meddling I've finally found the problem.

1. I think the no-cd crack that's included here is faulty. Download the one at http://gf.wiretarget.com/bw/rpg-bwci.rar and use that one instead.

2. If that still doesn't work try upgrading your original BnW to version 1.2.

3. If it still doesn't work then try to actually burn the CreatureIsle.iso included here to a CD and install from there.

4. Either one or a combination of these steps should get the game to run. I did all three steps and my game runs fine now."
