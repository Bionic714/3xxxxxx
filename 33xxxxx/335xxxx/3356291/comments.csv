Here's what worked for me:

1. Windows - Install this codec pack ( http://zhentarim.net/zx-pp.php ) and choose ""Media Player Classic - External Filters"" during the install. Then run the video using Media Player Classic.

2. Mac - Quicktime 7

3. Linux- Don't have access to a linux box so can't comment."
