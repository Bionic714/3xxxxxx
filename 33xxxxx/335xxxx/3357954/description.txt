Finally, a third EP from US-based wonderboy (what _is_ the secret of his 
power?) Grandma, aka Khonnor, aka Bronty The Shynocerous. Another four 
tracks of guitar-strummed, plaintively sung, wonderfully cut-up geektronica, 
we're delighted that people are really beginning to 'get' Grandma - he 
hopefully has material coming out on the forthcoming label Type, alongside 
cool peeps like Mokira (Mille Plateaux) and RJ Valeo (Hobby Industries), and 
he has a track as Khonnor adapting This Instrument on the new Soulseek 
Records compilation.

So, in the short wait before you can buy infinite amounts of Grandma albums 
in your local record store, try out these exquisite 4 tracks. "Kl", the opener, 
has an intensely beautiful acoustic guitar backing, overlaid with slo-mo stories 
of longing and wanting and we're not even sure what else. "Poke" is an 
evocative piece of alternately pumping and serene melody, and 'Are We 
Dead Yet?' twins intensely drifting chords with the most amazing spoken word 
piece about, well, laptop religion.

Finally, "Comics Battle" ends on a high note, all plaintive lead and 
Jenkinson-esque drums, the rhomboid port after the crystalline storm. It's 
been a sweet trip so far.. and who knows where the aftermath will lead?
