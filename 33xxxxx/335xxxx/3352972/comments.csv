,Adarious,2007-07-01T07:31Z,because pdf files aren't generally smaller than 2 floppy disks?
,andlabs,2007-07-19T23:14Z,Probably because the other one was compressed.
,andlabs,2007-07-19T23:14Z,"- as in PDFs can be compressed themselves. They are called ""compressed PDFs"" and are just the .pdf file probably with either lower quality or more direct text commands."
,casueps,2008-10-19T12:15Z,"It's 20MB because the pages are scanned, not OCR'd.
The other ones are just text, which is much smaller in size, and the text can be searched, not like this one."
