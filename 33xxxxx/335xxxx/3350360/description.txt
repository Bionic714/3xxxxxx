CPMA (Challenge ProMode Arena)
The next generation Quake is already here.

This torrent contains two videos showing of the Challenge ProMode Arena wich is the most technically advanced and fastest Quake up to date. The videos will first of all show ingame action (frags) from the "cpma done_by_Vo0" movie. The other vid called "ggl cpma4o4 promotion" is kinda what it says; a promotion video showing of the physics in CPMA. By physics i mean how you move, jump, trick around on maps etc etc.

For those interested to try out CPMA theres a .txt file in the torrent that will explain what you need to play.

Enjoy!
