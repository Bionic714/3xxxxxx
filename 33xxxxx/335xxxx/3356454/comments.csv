,sanQQQ,2006-04-06T06:29Z,Can someone open a window please? Please!! I need to have this!
,dddb,2006-04-24T04:24Z,"Actually, not true, Query.  There are several other CDs worth of Parker's playing.  One torrent on Isohunt consists of all the band sides on which he performed before he started releasing things under his own name.  A multi-CD set on Mosaic (never torrented, as far as I know) gives all the apocryphal performances recorded by Dean Benedetti.  There are also many other bootlegged performances that were released on smaller labels on LP and later on CD.  This torrent, wonderful as it is, only accounts for about half of what is still extant."

,crunkest,2008-05-09T07:42Z,"lots of charlie parker, but all of it's 128kpbs MP3... bleh.

good if you're unfamiliar and want to sample the legend, but really really bad if you're looking to replace your scratched CDs and vinyl."
,rahcoon,2008-05-25T14:54Z,"thanks, mr vertigo."
,xas210,2009-05-21T22:36Z,"thanks! seeders, please open your valves! =)"
,aopladmin,2011-05-14T19:54Z,"Yep, it's great collection but poor quality, 128kbps isn't standard today. I know source is not the best quality as it's old, but 128kbps destroys what's left. "
,alenquero,2011-09-30T19:14Z,merci mille fois

,ltristano317,2012-06-23T18:16Z,"At least on Disc 2 of the Savoy Sessions, the extraction is a mess -- almost every single track has 1-5 ""skips"" where a second or three of music is missing. That, and the bitrate...I guess this seed has done a lot to spread a lousy version of the complete Parker around the internet over the years."
