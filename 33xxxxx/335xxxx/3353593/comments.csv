I hope it's Stratholme then, that's like the only instance where a pala could act MT.

Just btw. I think you shouldn't be as taciturn as you've been when describing your torrents. :P"

stoped tanking at lvl 63 caus i got tiered of you doubters beliving that paladins cant fight or hold agro. so i speced holy and regret it still but respecing to asswhiper again at 70"
