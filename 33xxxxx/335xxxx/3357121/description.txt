M.Y.M.P. SOULFUL ACOUSTIC
The Ultimate Fan Collection (Phils, 2005)

One of the hottest bands in Phils Music. M.Y.M.P. (aka Make Your Momma Proud) offers a wonderful collection of acoustic originals and covers.

I may not be their fan, but I can assure they are pretty impressive. The originals were great, and the covers were sang and performed damn well. If your preference of music covers the genre specified for this band, you might want to get it.
