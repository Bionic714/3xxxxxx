,lleb,2005-07-13T09:30Z,yeah this one works.
,lleb,2005-07-13T18:11Z,it was just a glitched when i coppied the cedega2 directory over.  it looks like a few files got moved 2 times into multiple directories instead of just the one.  sorry about that.
,lleb,2005-07-13T21:06Z,"it is so worth it if you are done with dealing with the BS that is microsoft and all the viruses, spyware, etc..."
,Skruffy,2005-07-14T00:29Z,"Can anyone please tell me how too config p2p, want cedega installed manualy (don't wanne download cedega throw p2p)..."
,lleb,2005-07-14T03:37Z,"ahh howto docs are included in this torrent, please read the howtos, but unless you have an active transgaming account you can not use p2p to download anything."
,MurlocDundee,2005-07-14T13:43Z,"Hey hello,
It seems that some .tgz archives like mozilla-activex-installer and font-installer are broken, as I can t untar either of them; program exiting with bad file format..
Any ideas ?"

pull that one down and try the mozilla and font plugins off of that torrent.  they should still be the same, i do not think there have been any upgrades to those 2 packages.  

sorry i have only used the .deb as i run debian and have never tried any of them from source."
,puts,2005-07-15T12:20Z,"I tried reading all of the manuals, and adding ""manual=/usr/lib/transgaming_cedega:/usr/bin/cedega"" to my .point2playrc file and everything. but i still cant figure out how to configure Point2Play properly. Could someone perhaps point me in the right direction?

Thanks!"
,lleb,2005-07-15T19:06Z,you will not be able to use p2p without an active transgaming account.  without a TG account you should have little problems getting cedega to run.
,Skruffy,2005-07-17T14:09Z,Well WineHG.org works almost as good with alot of games/programs.. AND are free of charge :)
,Doom III lajvaren,2005-07-18T00:24Z,WineHG.org is a fake or joke. There is not such a software.
,ohne89,2005-08-08T03:46Z,"lleb meant WineHQ.org. I used to run World of Warcraft with it. Also runs CS1.6, Photoshop 7, + some more. Yes it is free i.e. completely open source. Apart from that it's faster than any emulator."
