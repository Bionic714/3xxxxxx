,shady78,2005-07-19T01:53Z,YUP TONY HAWK 4 AND THE ORIGINAL UNDERGROUND I PLAN ON UPLOADING  AS SOON AS I GET THE CHANCE HOWEVER I THINK THIS IS THE SMALLEST FILE OF THEM
,chronjohnson,2005-07-19T08:31Z,You sure it's Underground One for XBox?  Only thing I've seen here is Underground Two...and maybe One for PS2.
,shady78,2005-07-19T14:40Z,i have every one of them minus 3 and i no longer have one for ps1
,rajadingdong,2005-07-19T18:24Z,"stop uploading old p00 and tagging it - no 1 gives a sh1t its not new, you have just coppied from xbox and iso'd. only tag an iso if its uber new and rare  "
,shady78,2005-07-19T18:53Z,dude ill upload anything i want you dont want what i got dont download it then there are people who want this and are currently downloading
,gwellan,2005-07-19T19:26Z,"Yeah I always wanted that old game, I'm tired of playing the buggy pc version or the dreamcast version, thanks dude."
,shady78,2005-07-19T19:48Z,no problem
,Kismeth,2005-07-19T23:32Z,rajadingdong -> what's your problem anyway? If you want you can play 'good' new games while I will be playing old realy good games from shady.
,chronjohnson,2005-07-20T00:59Z,"And yeah, I hope no one has a problem with the uploading of old games.  I think the problem here is the labeling.  But who cares.  People can label whatever they want.  Only super-exclusive sharing communities have regulations about what can be labeled and when.  If you go through the effort of seeding a completely original torrent, it's handy to have a name on it to distinguish it.  In the future, people iwth the same copy can help propagate it if they know they've got the same file without resorting to arcane hash checks.  It's nothing against The Almighty Scene."
,shady78,2005-07-20T01:18Z,"question - how are people supposed to help me seed

answer - download it and share it


that is if they want it whats so hard about that"
,EmesiS,2005-07-20T09:17Z,Hey Shady78 thanx for the ups..don't really need them but thanx anyway. Since the files are small did you consider making a compilation dvd. Like put 3 or 4 of the Tony Hawks or other games on 1 dvd using Craxtion 4 with menus. I think people would grab those if they had 3 or 4 good games on them. Just a suggestion since you are uppin small file size games.
,edsn,2005-07-20T12:21Z,Thanx for this game the first two thps games are clearly the best 
[T],BarbieOnWeed,2005-07-20T16:52Z,"thanks dude, love this games!"
,shady78,2005-07-20T17:28Z,anytime
,chronjohnson,2005-07-21T00:02Z,I just don't see how telling people they'd better start sharing the file will help them download it faster.
,Rumteldat,2005-07-21T00:33Z,"Hey man thanks for posting this, I hope you post more old games,you wouldn't have genma onimusha would you?"
,Kismeth,2005-07-21T15:40Z,Works properly THANKS!
