|  With their fusion of rock, rap and funk, Audio Adrenaline emerged as one  |
|  of the most popular CCM acts of the 1990s. The group was formed on the    |
|  campus of Kentucky Christian College by lead vocalist Mark Stuart,        |
|  guitarist Barry Blair, bassist Will McGinnis, keyboardist Bob Herdman     |
|  and drummer Brian Hayes; originally named A-180, they recorded an         |
|  independent single, "My God," which caught the attention of Forefront     |
|  Records president Dan Brock, and soon after the label issued Audio        |
|  Adrenaline's self-titled debut LP. Don't Censor Me followed in 1993,      |
|  scoring hits with the singles "Big House" and "Can't Take God Away;"      |
|  after 1995's Live Bootleg, the band resurfaced a year later with Bloom,   |
|  which debuted in the Top 60 on the Billboard pop charts. In 1997, Audio   |
|  Adrenaline ù now consisting of Stuart, McGinnis, Herdman and drummer Ben  |
|  Cissell ù resurfaced with Some Kind of Zombie; Underdog followed two      |
|  years later. A greatest hits collection, Hit Parade, celebrated almost    |
|  ten years in the music industry, and served as a good introduction to     |
|  the band. Lift came out the following year.                               |
|                                                                            |
