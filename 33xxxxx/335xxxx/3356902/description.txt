SERIES DESCRIPTION

Free To Choose was an award winning PBS television series featuring the Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman. 10 films make up the series, each featuring a short documentary where Milton Friedman presents his views on a given topic followed by a discussion and debate with various participants including politicians, academics, business people, et al. 

In general the views expressed are contrary to the status quo of government involvement in daily life. In fact at the time the series was first aired it was given poor time slots by station managers that did not want it broadcast, and the program was even banned in France. Despite this suppression, the series went on to become a smash success leading to the best selling non-fiction book of 1980 and a follow-up series in 1990.
