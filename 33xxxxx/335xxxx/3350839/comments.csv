Dont it make your heart burst with pride at the spontaneous out pouring off gratittude and appreciation.    Dont It just make the effort to share all worthwhile, I mean 3289 selfish, self centred parasites cant all be wrong, can they ?."
,Innomen,2005-08-08T09:38Z,"Dreammaker, You're comment is thank you enough. You're contributions are above and beyond. I don't do this for pats on the back, I do this to prevent people from thinking that they are the only one, I do this to help prevent people from thinking they are a freak. Which is what I felt for years."
