Had these floating around for a while, and was surprised to see it wasn't nearly as popular on BT as I thought.  If you haven't ran across them yet, then here you go.

Other Notes:
* Episode 1x11 is the repack version (sound issue fixed).
* This is the medieval release, just in a bit more BT friendly format (extracted and renamed the episode files to include the ep names, rar'ed the nfo's together, skipped the samples).  I don't see the point of posting tons of rar files on this type of BT site.  Rar's don't save much bandwidth with xvid, so skipping them saves everyone disk space and hopefully gets you guys to seed longer :)

Upcoming Stuff?
* Season 1 Extras - I haven't seen them anywhere yet.  I'll try to post them if I find them, unless someone beats me to it :)
* Season 2 (Eps and Extras) - the DVD's are due out this month I believe.  Haven't seen a release yet, again if I get them I'll try to post them if someone hasn't done so already.
