,Themis.,2007-08-16T15:37Z,"Does anyone know which codec i should use to play parts from 1x03?
I have the DivX and the XviD codec installed, its just not working..."
,SpiderGav,2008-04-13T12:32Z,"More seeds would be nice otherwise its a waste of download time. come on u tight fuckers, seed seed seed"
,cronicclapper,2008-07-05T05:19Z,This torrent would be good if it had more people that actually speed with some speed.  I had 100kb for about a second then it just goes right back down.  It would be nice if I could just keep the 100kb instead of these awful 8kbs.  This is the slowest torrent I've ever downloaded.  I will help seeding if I ever get done.
,noafdcap,2008-07-07T11:21Z,"thanks, please seed"
,samwolf78,2008-08-31T09:02Z,So now that I have down loaded this awesome thing. How do I convert it into a file type that will burn to a DVD.
,dartb,2008-09-22T01:53Z,"I saw the uploader and got slightly confused for a second, heh.

I've been tempted to watch these for some time (I wasn't interested when it was first aired).  And the extras?

I think I love you."
