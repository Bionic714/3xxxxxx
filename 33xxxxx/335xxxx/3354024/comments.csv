,Mojohombre,2008-04-12T19:10Z,This torrent now appears to have invalid input conversion string!
,Mojohombre,2008-04-20T05:49Z,"I take back my foolish comment about the input string; the ""degree"" in the title confused the torrent; change the title and it works."
,vogageur,2008-05-28T14:18Z,"Hey thanks for this I have been looking for it since the time I first saw it without success.  I saw it when I was studying french in france and well dtddiver I feel the same way about it as you do.  Its all here now downloaded took ages but I am patient but I can cant seem to get it onto a dvd, burn it that is any suggestions of a software that burns iso to dvd"
,RubyMoor3,2009-01-13T23:58Z,"I love this film.  I'd disagree that Dalle did nothing afterwards - her part in Jim Jarmusch's Night On Earth was cool, even if Roberto Benigni outshone everyone.  But he often does anyway!"
,camj,2009-12-13T18:52Z,this is the 177 min version.
