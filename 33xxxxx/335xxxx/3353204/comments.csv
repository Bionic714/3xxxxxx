,asdfkeyboardman,2007-03-19T02:48Z,"Apparently whoever is shown as the one seeder is having connection problems or is incorrectly reported, since there are a ton of people stuck on 99.9%.
If somebody doesn't seed them up to finish, it will be depressing."

Found a similar torrent on a private tracker.

I will try to help you out / reseed this, once that DL is complete. May not work because some nfo files don't match, but I'll do my best to integrate."
,silver302,2008-12-11T13:02Z,"Integration worked. I am now seeding.

Have fun!"
