This version doesnt require a umd to be in the drive.This is the full game + loader, no sound till next release.

>> Requirements - Lumines Launcher by WAB

You should all know where to get the LuminesLauncher file and the Lumines ISO. Just replace the boot.bin in /PSP_GAME/SYSDIR with ours and hey presto no UMD checks - it can stay empty - now those who don't have a UMD disc can play.

> Notes:
We know why Lumines boots and the others don't. It's no "hack" just a fluke with certain checks. As you know there is no audio currently we will fix that in next release for you. Then we have our own loader and iso patches to get this shit busted properly. We have just opened a PSP hacking channel - most of the noobs are silenced so if you want some real dev talk come to #pspx on EFNET. Back to some Allegrex fun.....

> Modchip News:
What a crock of shit - some "news" sites are just desperate for hits. There is no modchip and as we see it none will ever be needed. That's the direct word - don't listen to anyone else gasping to jump on the bandwagon. Don't worry our loader will have a nice msg for themas this will be news they can't "selectively" ignore
