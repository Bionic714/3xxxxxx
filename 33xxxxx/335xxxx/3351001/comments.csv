,kevlupo1121,2005-07-02T01:06Z,"i don't doubt the legitimacy of this file at all, but i just wish someone laid it out a little better, or at least provided a readme for us n00bs who dont know everything. All i know is it has to be organized into folders, but there is no clear guide on that anywhere. Can someone please explain in detail? "
