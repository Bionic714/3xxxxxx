Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, for PSP viewing. Ripped from DVD and converted
using iPSP. Excellent video and sound reproduction, fits on a 512mb Memory Stick
and leaves space for game saves and other data.

The correct folder name for videos is E:MP_ROOT100MNV01 (where E: is the drive 
letter of your PSP). Put both of these files in 100MNV01 folder.
