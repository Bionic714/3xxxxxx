As promised; more brazilian psychedelia :D 

I`lll up more later if anyone is interested in this kinda music.

If you downloaded the Brazilian volume of "Love, Peace & Poetry" you have already heard one song on this album.  Modulo 1000 is one of Brasils famous progressive rock bands of the early 1970s, their only album became legendary in the collectors scene, as one of the best South American records of all times, besides Laghonia, Emiliano Zapata, Psiglo, Opus Alfa. As Luiz Simas (organ) remembers: "The music of Modulo 1000 had its own appeal to an audience that wanted a heavy, raw, experimental, psychedelic sound. Our kind of music did not make it to the radio stations. It was too wild. The distribution of the record was done in a very limited way. The record label directors, which probably didnt understand or even didnt like our music, did zero promotion for the LP." Highly recommended because of its individual and intense progressive sound.


If you like Iron Butterfly, Dug Dug's, Captain Beyond, Speed Glue & Shinki, Hendrix, Flower Travellin' Band etc - you`ll probably like this too, its in the same musical vein or so to speak.
