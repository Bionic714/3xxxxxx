,galaxyworldwide877,2011-04-12T06:21Z,"People, please seed!!! I have given this to 16 peers and there's only 3 seeds?! I didn't upload this , but 4 a long time I was the only seed; I wanted this torrent to stay alive cuz it's valuable. At least give it 1:1 so the torrent stays alive. If you would just seed it 2:1 b4 u delete it the torrent grows exponentially; and so on, and so on.....
