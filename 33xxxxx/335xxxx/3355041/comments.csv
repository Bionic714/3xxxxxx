Look at where you downloaded the game to (the 4 image files) theres also a file called ""The Sagara Family vmate crack made by Pahn.rar"" open it and copy the exe from the file to your game dir and overwrite it..... BAM its working and you dont even have to think about the VM protection"
,ahdes,2006-04-02T13:30Z,i managed to patch with the exe file but my game hangs when i click the game. any solutions? sometimes i manage to play but it is in half screen mode and no sound.

The problem is that I cant open that file! What am I supose to use? Its a RAR-file, and I cant open it"
,ssnake42069,2006-07-21T07:04Z,"I found a way to solve the game hanging at startup. I went to the peach princess site and clicked Support at the top, and i started reading (because i have same problem. i was searching around and seen you asked about it to) and it says to UNPLUG any Joysticks you may have. I have a plug and play N64/PS 1/2 Controller converter for playing other stuff. It solved the hang at the startup."
,BlazingWildfire,2006-08-07T02:08Z,Whenever I finish it and try to install it always says to insert the second disk.  The second file doesnt seem to work for some reason.  HOW DO I FIX THIS!
,bjerred,2006-08-16T09:24Z,"I just downloaded the game. What do I do with the different files? When i unzip the crack and click it, it says ""Cant use the connected file GGD""

,xElixerx,2007-08-15T13:20Z,okay.... download complete but now what? 
,xElixerx,2007-08-21T09:34Z,"From what i understand i have to open the RAR file and overwrite the ""game dir"" with the new exe file, but i only got the crack file and the 2 game disks along with their zips. There is no game dir and i have tried all the above. Is the Game dir hidden in a file? WTF needs to be done?"
,kaaitosan,2007-08-21T22:32Z,"Here is how to do it.
First, write the .mdf files to a cd or dvd using a program like dvd decrypter and when that happens it should convert automatically to a readable format. The two .mds files may not be used but keep them. The pop the first disk in a install normally. When the install is complete exchange the .exe file with the current installed one. Now it should work."
,asianpride528,2007-09-21T02:11Z,can someone givse me direction to overwrite the game exe and make it work plz 
,neo4tp,2007-09-30T09:56Z,"guys this game works as a feather, even though i was expecting this game to be like 3Dsexvilla & others....all you have to do is mount the first image cd and install the game..while starting installation uncheck 'VirtualMate' opton and continue. when asked for the 2nd cd unmount the 1st cd & mount the 2nd cd image & press ok.........upon completion of the installation unplug the internet & open ""The Sagara Family vmate crack made by Pahn"" & replace the exe in   your dir with the exe in it...play now with no problem.............i wonder how many will like this game. its just series of pictures...anyway its a feast to the eyes"

,Explorer_86,2008-03-21T09:35Z,"Is there a program, like Daemon tools or something, that lets you mount the .mdf files, instead of having to burn them to a cd or dvd? i don't have a cd/dvd writer..."

,geni44,2009-02-19T21:08Z,Taigia try daemon tools
,pwncakes,2009-02-22T16:15Z,"this has most likely already been written so i apologize for repeating... but for vista (and maybe other) users: mount the cd img 1 with daemon tools, you get the usually cd select what option yada yada, click on the run somethingarather .exe, select to install from the menu. as you're going through the install options, UNSELECT THE VMATE PLUGIN INSTALL, continue with the install, once it asks for disc 2 (or the game disc) simply right click daemon tools, go to where you had the first disc mounted, select mount, and choose disc 2, then press OK on the box and it'll continue with the install... once its done, DONT BOTHER RUNNING IT JUST YET, go to http://gamecopyworld.com/      find and download The Sagara Family v1.0.0.1 [ENGLISH] Fixed EXE then replace it with the exe thats in the folder in which you installed the game....it should now run perfectly"
,pwncakes,2009-02-22T16:17Z,"@ sandofgaara

,Hinu_Kagu,2009-03-13T02:23Z,"LOL...  i came across another problem after installing the game.  When i start the game it runs fine, until i have to use the left click button on the mouse.  I have to hover over the on screen icon's and press the ""Enter"" key to click the button.  I've tried re-installing and force re-check in torrents.  I'm out of ideas so if anybody could help me this issue that be great."
,Jonny17,2009-08-13T20:51Z,does this work with vista?

,kol33,2010-12-24T20:47Z,good game works fine!
,FoxyTheFoxer,2011-01-01T23:26Z,Good game Love it
,FoxyTheFoxer,2011-01-01T23:29Z,"Let me make installing this game simple. You need a program called DAEMON Tools Lite, Program called Winrar and an anti-virus/firewall.
1. Download DAEMON Tools Lite and Winrar (if you already have an unzipping program you do not need Winrar)
2. Open the folder you downloaded here using Winrar and extract it"
,FoxyTheFoxer,2011-01-02T00:15Z,"3. Go to http://gamecopyworld.com/ find and download The Sagara Family v1.0.0.1 [ENGLISH] Fixed EXE. Download the file and replace the two files in the folder you downloaded here (your firewall is needed here occassionally my computer gets attacked at this site. This is a game fix so you might not need it to play the game to its full extent)
4. In Daemon you want to add the file"" The Sagara Family - CD1.mdf ""(make sure that it is the .mdf file not .mds).
5. Then (still in daemon) mount the image (the file). You should get the option to Run SETUP.EXE with the icon of a girl and a heart (from the folder you replaced). (mounting an image in daemon is the equivalent to inserting a CD)
6. If you followed my instructions you should get a Sagara Family set up window. Begin install.
7. Half way through the install (when it asks for disk 2) you want to go back to daemon and add the file"" The Sagara Family - CD2.mdf "" (make sure it is .mdf). Mount it, then continue install
8. When install is done Go to My Computer and find where you installed the game (the game directory). It is the ZyX folder in your program files.
9. Replace the SAGARAML.exe (has girl with heart icon) with the one you downloaded. you are gonna need administrative rights on your computer cause you are messing with the program. (this gets past the virtual mate product key problem)
10. Close The Sagara family window
11. Back in daemon you want to Eject the device, Mount CD1, Run SETUP.EXE, Then play!
12. To play the game again after you have closed it repeat step 11

I use windows 7 so fyi It does work."
,LaciBug,2011-03-14T02:52Z,Kept saying I needed a user name and password.
,Gashimahiron,2011-03-19T18:58Z,"it worked just nicely!
win7 ultimate 64 bit!
and guess what?
it REALLY IS a giant game, you need to go at least 5 times through it to unlock all the content!
the art of making something small look big impress me sometimes!"
,Shjio,2011-05-22T23:22Z,FoxyTheFoxer's method doesn't work for me i just downloaded a lot of junk that i won't use cause it doesn't work. does anybody else have a useful method to play the game?... that works with this torrent of course
,ihatethefeds,2011-06-01T09:23Z,is it possible to just extract the images from this? I don't care much for the game...
,sfaddic182,2011-06-15T02:00Z,"for those who got problems halfway through the installation just when it says ""insert disk"" when you are at 50% mount the cd2 on the same virtual disk you put the 1st cd 
ex:
if you mount the 1st cd to Drive D,mount the 2nd cd on Drive D when they ask for the disk"
,FoxyTheFoxer,2011-08-19T10:52Z,"@ihatethefeds
Not possible to extract images from this download. just google download sagara family cg. u can get the actual images from somewhere else"
,Tateru,2011-08-30T23:37Z,works nice. just follow the nfo instruction for installation. great game ^^
,nuts99,2012-03-20T01:30Z,"I've downloaded the game from gamecopyworld and I've dowloaded the magnet torrent from here. Then I installed the game from the Sagara window with the .mdf thing. I'm using winRAR and Daemon Tools Pro but only the trial, I don't know if that makes a difference. But when I press play on the game window a popup for virtual mate keeps popping up. What am I doing wrong?"
,nuts99,2012-03-20T01:32Z,I've tried following foxy's instructions but I can't seem to get it to work.
