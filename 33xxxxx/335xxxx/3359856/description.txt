JOY DIVISION 
Color NTSC Video
SVCD .mpg 
52:38

You can burn this to a nice SVCD disc and watch on most DVD players.
Quality is about 2.5 or 3 out of five. Some cuts are better than 
others. I ripped this from a Joy Division bootleg video I bought a 
few years ago.  Although it's not top quality, if you're a JD fan and 
have never seen any of this, it's a must-see!
