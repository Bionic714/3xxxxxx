,roflontex,2008-03-21T16:05Z,does this work with vista?
,tavisjohn,2009-03-29T05:04Z,"Yes it works fine with Vista.
Running full screen @1440x900.

No ""compatibility Mode"" needed.

Oh and for an extra $10,000 type in FUND (Hold the SHIFT key, CapsLock does not work) But if you do it too many times, a disaster will happen! (Even if you have them turned off)"
