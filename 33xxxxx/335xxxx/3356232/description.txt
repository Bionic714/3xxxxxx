The sequel to one of the greatest shooters ever, Shikigami No Shiro (a.k.a. Mobile Light Force 2), has finally reached PS2 in the U.S. This arcade-style vertical shooter puts you in control of one of eight flying, shooting, superhumans, each with two character forms that alter their abilities. View the origins of each main character in Story Mode, or shoot your way through Arcade, Practice, or Boss Attack Modes. 2D and 3D graphics and animation combine for a truly visually stunning shooter, and more enemies with advanced firepower and patterns make this sequel even more challenging than the original!
