Invision Power Board, an award-winning scaleable bulletin board system, allows
you to effortlessly build, manage and promote your online community. Advanced
yet intuitive features like multi-moderation allow you to focus on developing
your community, rather than wrestling with complex settings.

NOTE: You probably saw this release by LOGiC earlier this day:
Invision.Power.Board.v2.0.4.PHP.NULL-LOGiC
This release is based on a stolen web-release called:
IPB.2.0.4.nulled.by.Tails.w********ce.net
The included nfo says:
[cut]
This copy of Invision Power Board 2.0.4 has been nulled by Tails (aka mjalan)
from w********ce.net

Protection removed: Version Checking
Other notes: I have changed the version from 2.0.4 to 2.0.0(Trial) so that
people in IPB still thinks u r using legal version.. :) but dun worry, it is
still version 2.0.4
[/cut]
LOGiC just changed the version back to 2.0.4 and removed some Hotlinks, License
Info and included their serial (info.txt). Read about this horrible security 
risk later.
But they made some mistakes:
/upload/retail/regkey.php
<?php
$customer_reg_key = '1114318800-24407-171-44844-LIFE';
$customer_copy_key = '';
?>
They left the key from the web-release there.

The idea of the web-release was to let the 2.0.4 look like a Trial version - so
they added a "(Trial)" in the copyright tag. LOGiC also have this tag in their
release and it is NOT included in the non-Trial version (yeah, we even have a
legit source!). Here are the proofs:
uploadsourcesadminadmin_skin.php (line 1050)

<div class='copy' align='center'>Powered by Invision Power Board(Trial) &copy ".date("Y")." IPS, Inc.</div>

uploadskin_cachecacheid_2
This folder would only be created if you run it on a webserver and it is only
included in the web and LOGiC release - it is NOT included in the fresh legit
version you can get from the developer because it was never installed before.

uploadstyle_imagescss_2.css
This file would be created too if you run it on a webserver - there is also a
message in line 7:
/* CACHE FILE: Generated: Thu, 05 May 2005 16:42:07 GMT */
this file either only is included in the web and LOGiC release!

Now lets get to the important point:
The developers IPS included a lic check function so they can check every online
Invision Power Board if it has a valid license by adding this:
?ipscheck=1 (example: http://www.domain.com/forum/?ipscheck=1)
If you use this on the LOGiC release you get this:
0000000000-0000-000-00000-REGD
If you use it on a legit forum you get a 10 digits number like on:
http://www.winfuture-forum.de/?ipscheck=1 you get this:
14857,26160
So IPS can easily get you if they see you use the LOGiC serial.

We bring you a Incl.Keygen Release which automatically generates a key and
includes it in your Invision Power Board - no activation in the Admin CP
needed.
