,bullit67,2005-08-07T16:58Z,This one works with bmw DVD mk4 16/9 widescreen system and  i dont now if it works with other system and i burnt it with Alchol 120. If it doesent work with alcohol 120 try mount image in daemon tools then use nero copy then you can chose writespeed to lowest possible

Bluescan I dont think it is the whole europe, I am not sure. Your second question. That is the older system with cd, its called MkIII I can use that cd on my system (dvdplayer) but they cant use my dvd on their system. "
