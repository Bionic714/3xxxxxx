,d-pad,2005-07-05T21:53Z,"hey juan, is this the directors cut? vhs rip? quality?"
,juan_delgado,2005-07-05T22:02Z,"This is the directors cut...103,43 min!
The qual isn´t excellent, but it´s much much better than an ordinary VHS!"
,d-pad,2005-07-05T23:58Z,"cool! i saw the premiere of the directors cut at a filmfest about 12yrs ago - introduced by richard stanley... haven't seen it since! have you also got HARDWARE? i've got it on VHS, but a dvd rip would be nice! ...dvd on amazon.com $99.99!!!"
,SomeGuy1999,2005-07-06T12:48Z,"Sunds great, thanx a lot dude"
,juan_delgado,2005-07-06T14:28Z,"Sure i can uppload hardware...in a week or so!
But I think U can find it if u use ""emule""
Thew best source for ""freakyflicks"" ;)"
,mGoLos,2005-07-06T16:45Z,"Thanks! Too bad I'm not a fan of emule, it seems you can find a lot of interesting stuff there :)"
,juan_delgado,2005-07-07T02:25Z,Ye You need a lot lot of time when you use emule...but you can find nearly everything!
,PandA,2005-07-07T18:57Z,"i cant get enough of freakyflicks. but i want some. allthough im not sure they all count as being freakyflicks. Northfork by the polish brothers must be one, but then there is gerry by gus van sant that im not sure of but its deffinetly not a really mainstreem movie. and if anyone could get a hold of either one of these movies i would be thrilled"
,d-pad,2005-07-07T23:15Z,GERRY and NORTHFORK are both being shared on WinMX... but that's slower than emule!!!
,Daeron,2005-07-08T02:07Z,"I have the same version. It's a DVD rip of the director's cut.

,warpengi,2005-07-08T02:48Z,Just finished watching this.  What a great movie!!!  Moves a little slow compared to your average hollywood trash these days but if you take the time to get into the mood and atmospere this one will definitely freak you out!  There's definitely some underlying social commentary going.  The best horror flicks have always done this and this one does it well.
,zubutix,2005-07-08T07:13Z,wow 1060Kbyte/s ner!!! fan va gött. Tackar som fasiken!
,d-pad,2005-07-09T00:16Z,"this cut is the same as the original UK vhs release, not the directors cut (which is shorter). interestingly, a version has just been released in germany on dvd that runs 87mins, the same as the original US video release."
,Daeron,2005-07-31T21:13Z,"Actually this is the restored director's cut, not the original UK VHS release cut.

Quote from IMDb:
""Exists in several version's. The restored final director's cut runs 103 min."""
