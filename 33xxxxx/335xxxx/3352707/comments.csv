Hopefully others will check on it from time to time and keep it going. Definitely ""The Five Doctors"" shouldn't die."

I downloaded this some months ago, and have been sharing, but I had to change harddrives, and had to recreate the torrent.  I must have done something wrong, becuase nobody is uploading from me...  Any ideas?  I really think this should be shared!"
