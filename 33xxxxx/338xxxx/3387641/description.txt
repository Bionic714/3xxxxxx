Day Of Defeat Source FINAL READ NFO-EMPORiO

Day of Defeat: Source (a.k.a DoD: S) is the latest online action experience 
from Valve, makers of HL1,HL2 and CS/CS: S. Stationed in the heart of 
WWII's European Theater of Operations, players join the ranks of an elite 
military squad entrenched in battle. 

Each team has several "player classes," that give each squad member a 
unique role. These include scout, infantry, sergeant, machine gunner, 
and more, each with a unique arsenal of historical weaponry 
at their disposal.

Release Notes: 

This release is full version, but we couldn't get the cd, because the game 
is getting release on cd in some days,weeks or even months, who knows?... 
So enjoy it anyway even if it isn't bin/cue/iso/whatever 

::::::TO ALL THE NUKERS:::::: 
SOME may contend the fact that this is BETA or PRE-FINAL. 
This is the version that is released on STEAM AS FINAL. You cannot do any 
better than this. The fucked thing with STEAM is they can easily release 
many patches BUT EXPECT the EMPORiO crew to bring each and every patch 
CRACKED to your doorstep!  

If you nuke this for no bin/cue GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS. HOW CAN 
this game be BIN/CUE if there is no official store release, but its still 
final. 

If you want to compare this w/ the final just find someone who bought HL2 
(Game gets unlocked on 26th of September 2005)
