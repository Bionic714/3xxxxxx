,arkmtex,2006-11-16T20:13Z,"Why do people even bother to use this heaping pile of crap? StuffIt Expander uses the most primitive compression methods and achieves so little when archiving/compresssing files...

p7zip is free, open-source, and uses LZMA compression to achieve the best compression available - http://homepage.mac.com/krmathis/

Unless you're stuck back in the 90's with .SIT and .HQX files (anything worth downloading for Mac nowadays comes in .DMG disk-image file format) StuffIt Expander isn't worth your time or download."
