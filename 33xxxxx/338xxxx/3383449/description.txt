The meanies in Negativland and Crass's favourite pop group, Chumbawumba despoil the collective dream of Teletubbies land with this single containing a 13-minute collage made for BBC radio. Equal parts joke and subversive polemic, the work slices and dices the Queen, "Tubthumping," the Sex Pistols, the Spice Girls, the M*A*S*H theme, Chic, George Bush, Gore Vidal, Noam Chomsky, Sesame Street and Alexander Berkman's 1929 publication ABC Of Anarchism. Further infringement strategies come in the form of The Weatherman's "(c) Is For Stupid" remix. If you need a product that represents your belief in freedom and humour, this is what you want, what you really, really want.
