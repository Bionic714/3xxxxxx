Hadjidakis is the more common variant of the composers name. Outside Greece he is mainly remembered for the film score of "Never on a Sunday". This is a recording where he orchestrated some of his best songs for a setting of two guitars, piano, harp and bass in 1964. The title means "15 vespers", but it sounds great at any time.
A real classic!
