,En Venn,2008-05-18T16:22Z,"If you don't want to overwrite any of the existing saved games just change the last number to something else.

""GTASAsf1.b"" - just change 1 to something between 1 and 8. It just indicates which save block it is. If you change to 5, it will be #5 in the game.


Works like a charm to me ;)"
