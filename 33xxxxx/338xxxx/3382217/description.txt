V. Artyomov:
Born
29 June 1940 in Moscow.
Education
Artyomov started studying physics at the University of Moscow. He decided to change and studied composition under Sidelnikov at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory in Moscow, where he graduated in 1968. He was (with Sofia Gubaidulina and Viktor Suslin) the founder of the Improvisationsensemble ?Astreya".
Style
The style of the first composition of Artyomov were neoclassical. Then he discovered the folkloristic style of Russian, Caucasian and Mid-Asian people. His style developed in a free-rhythmic, polytonal way. Sometimes he approached the minimalistic style. Last years Artyomov' compositions are in a mystic-religious style.
