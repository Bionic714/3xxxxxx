,SomeGuy2005,2006-03-16T04:24Z,"Great upload, unbelievable that 1000 people have downloaded and none have taken the time to thank the uploader for this great series. "
,disobedient,2006-04-10T01:54Z,"Actually a few people had thanked me and commented that this might be missing an episode (it's not, in fact two episodes are combined).  For some reason TPB must have deleted the old messages.  But thanks (and thanks to SKK who originally posted the individual episodes)."
,kennyg101,2006-04-15T16:27Z,Thanks for the info about the combined episodes. I was scratching my head. IMDB says 13.

,P-dot,2008-03-15T11:14Z,"It would seem that the combined episodes are the first two:

A Touch of Murder

Family Affairs.


Just speculation on my part, though, as I'm still downloading."

,johannamoshtar,2008-10-28T20:00Z,"The episodes are actually in the proper order and named correctly. The listing at tv.com is incorrect, the one at imdb.com has it right.

Just saying."
