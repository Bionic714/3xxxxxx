,jheriko,2006-02-04T07:20Z,"What the hell are these files? They don't play easily as they use an odd combination of file layout and codecs. Why can't you people produce ordinary video files?

Interestingly the audio works if I change the extension to .mov... but thats about it. Thanks for wasting my time with this download... I have spent a good hour googling and reconfiguring my codecs to no avail.

Feel free to call me noob etc... "
