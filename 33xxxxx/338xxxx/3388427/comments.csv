,Sharak23,2010-09-02T23:05Z,5 albums only 290mb? must not be very good quality. 
,spunkster,2011-12-31T18:42Z,"These are in m4a format, which is AAC-LE. The format is much better quality than mp3 at a similar size and bitrate, and was designed to replace mp3s. It's a tiny bit bigger than 128k mp3 files but much smaller than 192k mp3s. I compared a couple of tracks here - just as I suspected, they do sound better than the 128k mp3 version, but not as good as 192k mp3. 

Also, they're a weird format and may not work with your software or hardware player."
