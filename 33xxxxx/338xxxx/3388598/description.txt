Quotes: Ivan Dobsky: I didn't do it! I only said I did it so they'd take the rat out of my anus!

'Monkey Dust' is a feast of sick animation, with sketches concerning a sad-eyed man who tells wide tales about where he's been, when he's actually been doing something muckily sexual; a reality-TV series called 'People on the Toilet', where the star eventually becomes a big big star and candidate for Pope; and other such things. There's plenty of black humour, violence, and wife-swapping which turns into cannibalism.

Inspired humour and twisted tales make 'Monkey Dust' a must-see for fans of Jam, Spaced, and Big Train, as well as former viewers of the likes of Spitting Image.
