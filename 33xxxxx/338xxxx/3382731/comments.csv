,cachehit,2007-07-20T15:26Z,"I have been stuck on this torrent at exactly 95.44% for about 2 weeks now.   Is there anyone out there with the full file that could seed it?   I tried watching it withe the 5% missing - the first file plays, though it skips, jumps and pixelates from time to time.   The second file does not play past the first 10 seconds, in any of a number of osx and linux players I tried (vlc, mplayer, quicktime).
