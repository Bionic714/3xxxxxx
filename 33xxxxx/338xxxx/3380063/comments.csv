After downlodaing, MD5 didn't match... but I'm gonna try it anyway! ;.;"
,soleitix,2006-01-23T04:28Z,"After reading the description a bit more carefully, I'm guessing this already had the patch installed-  in any case, I re-applied the patch, and after burning, managed to install without problem.

Installed and tested working in VMware, booted on both Intel-based systems as well as AMD, Nvidia based chipsets and VIA alike.  Seems working!  Lacks support for network on most systems, as well as most video.  No sound support on anything that I'm aware of, but I believe anything that has mac OS X support should work.  :D"
