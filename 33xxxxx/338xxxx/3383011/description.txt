      GripShift is one of the first video games for the PSP to combine 
      high-flying stunt driving and unique puzzle-solving action in an all-out, 
      pedal-to-the-metal driving experience. Players will drive as one of the 
      six unique characters in suped-up vehicles as they stunt their way 
      through insane twisting levels while collecting power-ups, avoiding 
      traps, beating the clock and challenging friends.
