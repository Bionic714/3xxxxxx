Cleveland Browns at Indianapolis Colts
9/25/2005

I missed the first couple of minutes of this game, because a stupid error box popped up at the launch of the pvr program, but I got the rest of the game from there on out.  Recorded via tv tuner card off a rather bad cable signal.  As a Steelers fan living in Cleveland, I know how frustrating it can be when you're team isn't shown on tv, so if there are any Brownie fans out there who didn't get to see the game, here you go.
