The first rule of every lesbian, it's been said, is never to fall in love with a straight girl. Easier said than done! There are so many lovely girls out there! And after all, it may very well expand your heart if you do. Girls are love, right?

Kissing Jessica Stein is my favourite comedy, regardless of theme. It was made by Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen. Originally they made it a stage play. After quite some time they approached a movie company to make a film of it. The company said 'yes' but also said they needed the usual name actors to boost its market potential. Jennifer and Heather decided they wanted to play the parts themselves, which made executives call for severe budget cutbacks. Good thing! Jennifer and Heather had been friends for a great many years, written the play and the screenplay together, acted it together, lived with it together. This results in an extremely tightly acted co-starred film with their mutual rapport evident in every shot.

Ladies and ladies: The best comedy ever (but only according to little me, mind you!): Kissing Jessica Stein !
