DESCRIPTION:

John Sullivan (James Cavieze) is a dedicated young cop whose career has just cost him his relationship as he pursues a serial killer known as The Nightingale killer due to his victims all being with nurses.
One evening while sitting at home his friend Gordo (Noah Emmerich) and his kids stumble across the old CB radio his father used to use and they start playing around with it.
Later that night while alone John gets an incoming message from a guy called Frank and it soon becomes apparrent to John that it is none other than his Father Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid) 30 years ago to the day using the same radio in the same house.
Frank is unconvined until information given to him by John saves him from the fire that killed him 30 years earlier.
However cheating death comes at a heavy price especially when it interferes with the timeline
and from this point on Johns life becomes a nightmare.
Working together 30 years apart with only an old CB radio for communication they must now try to repair the damge they have caused by interfearing with history.
A highly watchable film with an original plot that grips you from the first moment and holds you there until its conclusion.

Enjoy.
