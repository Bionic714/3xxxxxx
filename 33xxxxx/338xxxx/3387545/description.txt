HP Financial Calculator application for Windows.  Used to be included on all HP Pavilion PCs and laptops.  Does not resemble an HP12C, but does include all the functionality and more!  Features include Currency Converter, various Measurements Converter, RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) or Arithmetic entry.  This software runs in the 16-bit Windows environment (wow.exe,) so it should run on almost any version of Windows.
