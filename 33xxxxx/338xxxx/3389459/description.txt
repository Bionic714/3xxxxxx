miniPE is basically a bartPE CD.
In other words, a version of Windows XPSP1, that runs straight off the CD. Its useful to fix broken installations, or to use your NTFS partitions outside of windows, and a million other purposes. All the below apps are contained on this distribution.
Its not exactly a CD version of what gets installed on HDD, download to find out. You will certainly enjoy it.
-----------

Most of you are by now, familiar with "miniPE" and what it is about - this is a new version release with added/updated apps, and of course, all new virus defs. 

This CD is meant to "autoboot" meaning that when the CD is placed in the tray, and your computer is rebooted or turned off/on, 
the system will boot to the OS located on the CD. 
You may have to change some BIOS settings if your computer does not look to the CD before the HD for system booting. 
You may also have to press a key during boot to bring up a menu to choose your boot device.
