This Submarine Titans CD Image is (to bad) Polish. I will post the English version as soon as I found it. Now I play skirmish, if I play the camaign right now I don't understand a thing. If you want to play skirmish you need to click (when you are in the main menu): upper left button, upper right button. In this screen you can adjust setting by pressing the button left of the 'START' button. I don't know what all this buttons do except changing you colour and team. It's very odd that the AI difficulties are in English while the rest is in Polish!? If anyone can translate this for a bit clearer view of what all the settings are, please do it! I want you reward you for that but I have nothing!
