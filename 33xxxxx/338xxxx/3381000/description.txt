     $$$$  Kerio Personal Firewall  represents smart, easy-to-use     $$$$
     $$$$  personal security technology that fully protects personal  $$$$
     $$$$  computers against hackers and internal misuse.             $$$$

     $$$$  Kerio Personal Firewall (KPF) helps control how your       $$$$
     $$$$  computer exchanges data with other computers on the        $$$$
     $$$$  Internet or local network. Kerio Personal Firewall is      $$$$
     $$$$  designed to protect any Windows PC that is connected to    $$$$
     $$$$  the Internet using DSL, cable, ISDN, WiFi or satellite     $$$$
     $$$$  modems.                                                    $$$$

     $$$$  Professional and corporate users residing behind a         $$$$
     $$$$  perimeter firewall such as Kerio WinRoute Firewall, would  $$$$
     $$$$  still benefit from using Kerio Personal Firewall on their  $$$$
     $$$$  computers. Kerio Personal Firewall prevents individual     $$$$
     $$$$  computers from attacks initiated by other internal users   $$$$
     $$$$  or compromised systems. It is also advisable to have       $$$$
     $$$$  Kerio Personal Firewall on every notebook for remote       $$$$
     $$$$  workers who connect to the Internet from unsecured         $$$$

     $$$$  cracking which involves dongle cracking / specific         $$$$

     $$$$  you work for a cad/cam type of company, or can access      $$$$
     $$$$  software related to design/graphics/architects, then you   $$$$

     $$$$  legit (non-carded, non-stolen) BNC/SHELLs for internal     $$$$
     $$$$  group usage, then contact us right away. The BNC/SHELL     $$$$
     $$$$  do need to have a uptime of 95% or higher, server should   $$$$
     $$$$  not be lagged by any processes, link should be 10mbit+     $$$$
