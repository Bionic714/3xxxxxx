this good shit, i mean?

like Michael Jackson said:

They told him don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So seed it, just seed it

You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So seed it, but you wanna be bad

Just seed it, seed it, seed it, seed it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just seed it, seed it
Just seed it, seed it
Just seed it, seed it
Just seed it, seed it

They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So seed it, just seed it

You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they seed you,
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So seed it, but you wanna be bad

Just seed it, seed it, seed it, seed it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Just seed it, seed it, seed it, seed it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Just seed it, seed it, seed it, seed it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just seed it, seed it
Seed it, seed it, seed it

seed it, seed it, seed it, seed it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or who's right

Just seed it, seed it, seed it, seed it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Just seed it, seed it, seed it, seed it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just seed it, seed it
Seed it, seed it, seed it

Seed it, seed it, seed it, seed it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or who's right

Just seed it, seed it, seed it, seed it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Just seed it, seed it, seedt it, seed it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
