Norways brightest electro-pop stars Apoptygma Berzerk are set to  
 release their first new material since 2002's "Harmonizer"        
 album.                                                            
                                                                   
 Propelled to the forefront of the rising future-pop scene APB     
 transcended genre bounderies with their infectious blend of       
 catchy trance infused electronics, rousing choruses and           
 compelling club arrangements - constantly updating their sound,   
 throwing off the darkness of earlier releases for a more          
 club-friendly approach.                                           
                                                                   
 Now back with a new, refreshed vigour and sound they have         
 welcomed former APB guitarist Anders Odden back into the fold -   
 they return with brand new single "In This Together" - an         
 unashamedly commercial comeback ...
