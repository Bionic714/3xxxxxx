Well, I've decided that my pirate shtick will be, "the guy that steals P+P RPGs". Given that White Wolf sued its own fanclub without second thoughts, I figure I've got  maybe three months before they send vampires to eat my soul, so I'm kicking into overdrive.

This is an anime RPG. IT is better than BESM by any fair contest. Better than randomanime? I have no clue; I haven't played it. Whatever. If you like P+P games, and/or you like anime, then download it.

The homepage is www.wiseturtle.com

Next realease: Exalted corebook + all the other Exalts and the Fair Folk. I'm forced to use the retarded quadrapalegic of the file sharing world: eDonkey. Hooray for 9 bits of download after 20+ hours in queues.

You guys are going to owe me your freaking souls when this is done.

Incidently, I just got VII.I'll add it to the nWoD torrent when I'm done seeding this.
