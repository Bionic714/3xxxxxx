I?m Jack Carver, a man stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time. Stranded alone in a remote tropical backwoods, I'm being pursued by an elite force of mercenaries. 

To outlast this wilderness hell, I need to adapt and unleash every imaginable combat and survival skill and evolve into the ultimate predator!
