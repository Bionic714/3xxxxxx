  The Suffering: Ties That Bind is a revolutionary action-horror game 
  that emphasizes the disturbing terror of its predecessor, with all-new 
  twisted creatures and a few familiar faces. Set in the slums and prisons 
  of Baltimore, the player once again controls Torque as he seeks revenge 
  against the mysterious grand manipulator Caleb Blackmore, a man somehow 
  tied to the death of Torque's family. Players will explore the tough and 
  unforgiving inner-city streets, with poverty and urban injustices trapping 
  people just as effective as a physical prison. The unique morality system 
  returns, as players delve into the perverse world of Torque's sanity to 
  discover his past and struggle to control his future.
  
  - JOURNEY INTO MADNESS: Delve deep into Torque's past with flashbacks and 
    define his future path while battling inner demons, rage, and a tenuous 
    grip on sanity. 

  - DISTURBING CHARACTERS AND CREATURES: A plethora of brand new ferocious 
    fiends in addition to several returning favorites designed to depict tough 
    societal problems like street crimes, gun violence and riots that prosper 
    in poverty stricken slums. 

  - CHOOSE YOUR PATH - CHOOSE YOUR PLOT: Define the true story behind the nature 
    of Torque's crimes and his journey into madness with game-defining moral 
    choices that affect the game's outcome - each path providing a completely 
    different gaming experience. 

  - MASTER THE RAGE: New multi-leveled insanity mode is tied directly to players' 
    actions, creating the most deadly weapon in the game - Torque's inner demon. 
    This giant, horrific creature goes from normal to brutal and bloodthirsty 
    depending on the moral path that players choose to follow. 

  - A SEEDY, URBAN WORLD: Explore the gritty slums, streets, and prisons of Baltimore, 
    battling urban injustices and demons spawned from historical events of urban squalor. 

  - REFINED AND ENHANCED GAMEPLAY: Featuring a redesigned and streamlined inventory, 
    expanded player movement mechanics, refined controls, more varied and advanced enemy 
    AI and a large arsenal of weapons Ties that Bind melds big action sequences with 
    visceral horror elements.
