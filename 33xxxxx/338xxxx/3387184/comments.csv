Extremely satisfying book, one of the best martialartbooks ive ever read. to fully appreciate it some grappling background is required."

I don't think jiu-jitsu is only for gay falks, is this some kind of joke?"
,Mr.Mash,2008-05-08T12:41Z,"I was wondering also that ""Gay"" thing. I hope didn't do that yourself, quatoof, because that tells that you are retard."
