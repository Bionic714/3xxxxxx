,leenponyd,2006-08-14T06:14Z,"this keeps getting downloaded, but the password remains MIA. anyone? i'm not gonna keep seeding if people can't even open this once they get it."
,MtvFool,2006-08-16T07:01Z,"Yeah, what the fuck is that?! At least post the password on here!! I'll quit seeding if people can't open it."
,leenponyd,2006-08-16T07:44Z,"well, now that i notice the original posting date was almost a year ago....i've sadly stopped seeding. i just can't bring myself to delete the file.

,demonic667,2007-10-16T18:08Z,"wtf?  Stats show 1 seeder and 1 leecher, but there's only me and one other person leeching, and we're both stuck at 23.9% for days now.  Where's the seed?

If you have this, please seed!  Thanks."
,lblunchbox,2009-01-14T05:21Z,"so, uh could we possibly get a seeder?
2 peers here at 24.3%"
,lblunchbox,2009-01-20T00:40Z,"still kinda rediculous, 46.6%... I will keep seeding for a while, if i can just get one."
