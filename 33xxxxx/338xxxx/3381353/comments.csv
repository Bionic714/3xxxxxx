I just clicked on it so it will be a bit before it finally lands, but thanks for the seed hey :-)

If I held up my hand, and counted the 5 best of all time, ""don't want to piss off in an alley"" wrestlers, Bret would be among them.

Choreographed or not, this man has incredible skill, and in ""real life"" would be VERY hard to damage.

Thank you for posting it, I miss the old days..."

I'm actually surprised to see the torrent is still up. I'm glad these files are sticking around, to show just how good Bret was in his day."
