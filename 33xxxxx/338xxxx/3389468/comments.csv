The read me file doesn't help much. The internet says something about disconnecting optical drives & running from a USB2 external drive. Is this true? 
If so it should be made clear in the info"

,GIMMETVDVD,2007-10-12T20:00Z,"Ok I found a working serial and crack
1st here is serial UVNPB-UWDX9-5X48F-FBK5S-BL2YP

Then i found a working crack at http://www.gamecopyworld.com search for colin mcrae 2005 and you have to download 2 cracks
1st the 26.4 mb file overwrite folder with these files then you download the 2.3mb file and overwrite existing .exe and then it should work cause it did for me. If it doesnt work for you dont blame me. Cracks are tricky business Bea Singha2 should have put a crack in with this iso file"
