,uttern1406,2006-01-06T16:10Z,Hur får man detta att funka ?
,CodeMan,2006-01-07T08:56Z,"Cant get this to work either.
Burned the game as it says in nfo.
anyone know how to fix it?"
,cth1,2006-01-08T05:57Z,"CD 3  will not work after game is installed.

Any way to get this to work please?"
,Micksterino,2006-01-13T19:01Z,"I downloaded this game the other day and I´ve just installed it without any problems so far... (I have just played 11 holes on one course) I used the deamon v.3.47 instead of burning the images and mounted all three discs at once. Don´t know why but it works for me apparantley so it´s nothing wrong with the game as it seems. Perhaps it´s the drivers for your graphic cards that is messing up the game. Try to update and see if it helps.

Anyway the game looks nice and I think I´ll enjoy playing it."
,atziii,2006-01-14T18:28Z,"Micksterino, how do u mount all three discs at once? :S i even dont understand how to mount one disc.."
,Micksterino,2006-01-15T01:15Z,"U set the number of devices to three in deamon. Then U choose device, mount image and the pick the file you wish to mount. "

,Kalashnik,2006-01-31T21:50Z,"Ok guys if u dont get it work. and the problem is that when u start the game it crashes then make sure ot turn off ur Daemon tools and import the images trought Alcohol..

if that wont work make sure you installed alcohol with advanced setup and change the beginin of the driver codes to something else. worked for me.

btw you can see that the game stops to some emulator device when u read the error message little more deeply.. so happy hole in ones :)"
,merckx,2006-01-31T23:12Z,"Takk skal du ha Grodan_80. :) It worked.
But now I have a new problem...
