 Iceland has been for years a fertile ground for unconventional musicians. After the Sugarcubes and Björk, Gus Gus and more recently Sigur Rós, Múm is now proving to be the freshest act to hail from the North Atlantic isle. Formed in 1997 after Gunnar Örn Tynes and Örvar Þóreyjarson Smárason spotted Gyða and Kristín Anna Valtýsdóttir, then aged 15, during a concert of the band they used to be in, Múm is the unlikely combination of four diverging talents. Gunnar started playing music on his old Amiga, producing hardcore techno, while Örvar discovered the joys of electronic music when his parents bought a computer and he needed some music for a video game he had just written. With the two classically trained twin sisters on board, Múm was ready to start exploring original ways of producing poetic electronic music.
