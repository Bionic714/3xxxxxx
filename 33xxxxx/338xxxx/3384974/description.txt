Akanoid present their second album on Insolation.

The two musicians from the Sauerland have gained experience which they use on 'Metamorphin' to make various musical influences into rousing and pushing Psy Trance jewels.

Again accentuated guitar entries, a range of wonderful keyboard and string sounds as well as Theissen'S temporary vocal numbers create a dense atmosphere full of emotionality.

However, the real focus are obviously compelling beats and grooves being meant for the trance floor, and the spectrum does go from sunny sounds for the morning via dark rhythms for the night up to relaxed ambient sounds.
