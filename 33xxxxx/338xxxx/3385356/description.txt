This is the same video as "Live NY Underground 1982" which I previously uploaded, but due to hard drive constraints I had to compress and convert it to AVI.  I figured that some of you would rather have this version than none at all, because people don't seem to be seeding.  The qulaity is the same as the original, though the resolution is smaller (288x160).

Please seed!
