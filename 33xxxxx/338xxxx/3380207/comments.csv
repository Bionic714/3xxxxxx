Startar jag spelet med ig2.exe i patch mappen blinkar skärmen svart några gånger sen avslutas det. Startar jag spelet med original ig2.exe funkar det men då kommer det några jättesniglar som kryper över skärmen, ytterst störigt."

,Musika,2007-10-06T13:42Z,"Um, wtf i get it all installed and crap and it wants to test my grafic card, stalls and doesn't go further"

,xray686,2008-02-24T15:22Z,"Have been checking around alot about this game. To make it short:
Industry giant 2, is not compatible on GeForce 6, 7, and 8 series. Which means does who does have that grafic card can't play the game. However been digging around for hours and found a patch wich fixes this.
http://forum.jowood.com/showthread.php?t=148407
this patch only supports the english and german version of the game. To bad I had the original polish version.
This game consists several bugs and needs therefore to be patched. Which makes it hard if you want to download the illegal version.

My advice is to not download this file, dont think it work, and secondly, if it would work then you would have problems with patching and then finding the right crack to it.  "
,xray686,2008-02-25T19:19Z,"writing again. I got the game working. I got geforce 6.. , which means the game shouldn't be able to run on me computer. 
This info will NOT help thoose who have other grafic card than geforce 6,7,8...  

Thoose who have it, do like this:
1.Download this file
2.Install all of it's content, do not crack it with the crack which comes with the download
3.http://forum.jowood.com/showthread.php?t=148407 download from Bombardiers post
Nvdia Mod v1.0  and 
Nvidia Mod Update v1.10 for Gold/Add-on 
4. Install Nvdia Mod v1.0 and follow it's instructions.
5. Install Nvidia Mod Update v1.10 for Gold/Add-on and follow it's instruction 
6. Do the Installer and ENGconfig step again with the Nvdia Mod v1.0
7. Download a cd key and then start the game
8. Enjoy! 

TIP: DO not crack the game, start the game with daemon tools, mount cd 1.

This is how I did it, and it worked for me."

,Peonage,2008-09-16T05:30Z,Usless for anyone with a modern computer. Easy enough to get going until it tells you it wants to check your computers graphical ability. I have a 8600M GT 256mb and it failed. Looked into the patches. Its to much effort for not enough fun. Unless you have a old computer move on to something else.
,odytzi,2009-01-31T01:31Z,"The game is wonderfull and works perfectly after you have insatlled the Nvidia mods 1.0,1.1 and 1.2.Thanks you uploader,its a great game.
