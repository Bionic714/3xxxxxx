Psyshop is proud to announce the album of this summer!

Following hot on the heels of the album by Alien Project 'Groovy', Ari the Alien has teamed up with Avi the Space Cat to catapult us into another stratosphere.

The collaboration fell together and gelled instantly. A project that came together very quickly, after all night studio sessions and in between numerous gigs around the world. It came out of nowhere, within a lunar cycle and it's a real treat for all.

The quality and the vibe are so high that the benchmark has yet again been raised.

Enjoy!
