The movie is compressed with DVD Shrink. I tried to minimize the compression of the movie and audio by maximizing 
it for the menus and extras.


This is a movie by the great director who also made the wonderful movies "Ulysses' gaze" (1995) and "Eternity and a day" (1998). I'm still waiting for them to be released on DVD...

The beautiful music is written by the greek composer Eleni Karaindrou, who also made the music for the other films mentioned above.
