,Toadster,2006-01-04T13:33Z,"thx alot, dont i need a nocd crack for this?"
,Toadster,2006-01-04T14:03Z,"It just says invalid cd key here, anyone got a key?"
,Rob2102,2006-01-05T02:52Z,"ok i just been playing this and am seeding now, to get it to work unplug all optical drives (CD/DVD Readers/Writers) download and install latest Daemon Tools (4.03) mount image, leave all emulation off and it works fine, make sure the only virtual drive is Daemon Tools!!"
,Maastah,2006-01-06T22:50Z,Working cd-key plzzzzzzzzzzzzz
,Maastah,2006-01-06T22:53Z,rob2102 could you give me cd-key. I'm wanna play this as fast as is possible
,Dewni,2006-01-07T17:34Z,Is there somybody that actually played this rel.?
,Rob2102,2006-01-08T02:42Z,"yeah i told you i played it, you don't need a CD key. follow the instructions i posted before and it will work"
,Rob2102,2006-01-08T02:48Z,"And if you have Alcohol or nero image drive installed they must be Disabled before attempting to run it, my suggestion is if it don't work, uninstall it, then run regedit and browse to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREInvictus-GamesCross Racing Championship and delete the whole folder,.... then download and install latest daemon tools, disable any othe virtual drives then shut down your pc..... open it up, unplug any ide cd-roms/writers then start it back up....mount the image file in daemon tools, leaving all emulation options off....then install... when its done run it and it will tell you that its successfully installed and needs to reboot, let it reboot then run and if you have followed my instructions word for word i guarantee it will work.... you have my word ;-)"
,Rob2102,2006-01-08T02:49Z,You Need to have the latest version of daemon Tools though to emulate the starforce protection
,MeriadoC1337,2006-01-08T14:12Z,Can someone help me with a CD key?? I think it's a bit uncarefull to put a game online without a CD key.
,MeriadoC1337,2006-01-08T14:22Z,"sorry, there was a bug in my browser :p But I already tried all that stuff. "
,Rob2102,2006-01-08T14:32Z,Whats up with some people??? if u read the instruction you don't need to enter a cd key!!!!
,Rob2102,2006-01-08T14:33Z,"uninstall it then follow the instructions, it will work i assure you, i have just been playing it"
,Rob2102,2006-01-08T14:34Z,"you don't need to burn it, just mount the image in daemon tools 4.03. make sure its not an earlier version"
,MeriadoC1337,2006-01-08T14:42Z,"Dude, why would I have to open up my whole fricking PC for playing a game. this way I'll end up placing bombs on freaking software producers."
,MeriadoC1337,2006-01-08T14:45Z,Rewrite your manual for everyone in a way so it's easily understood. And what if you have IDE Harddisks? 
,MeriadoC1337,2006-01-08T14:46Z,"And my browser is being buggy, so I'm a little pissed, sorry. 

I just burned the whole thing, it costed me 3 CD's. I mean, isn't there any other way to make a burned CD work?"
,Maastah,2006-01-08T14:48Z,i uninstalled alcohol i unpluged cd driver i have daemon 4.03 and it still doesn't work. What's going on !?It says the same thing: wrong cd-key bla bla bla(...).
,Rob2102,2006-01-08T15:55Z,"look mate i aint wrote a manual, i got the game runnin so was good enuff to share how i done it, it will work!! if you get the wrong cd key message uninstall it, then follow the instructions, make sure you run regedit and delete any keys in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREInvictus-GamesCross Racing Championship cos this contains your dodgy key.   as for openin up your whole pc to play, if u wanna play it u will have to do it, by the way optical drives are IDE ;)
Hope this helps"
,Rob2102,2006-01-08T17:28Z,"by optical drives i mean any cd-roms or dvd roms or any cd/dvd burners, obviously you have to leave ur hard drive plugged in!!"
,MeriadoC1337,2006-01-08T19:26Z,"So it's not like when I replug the CD/DVD-rom drives, that the game won't work?"
,Maastah,2006-01-08T20:08Z,"ok, i delete key in regedit but when game starts it make up new one what i have to duo to stop this process?"
,Rob2102,2006-01-08T20:42Z,"yes when you plug them bak in the game will not work, then when you want to play it, unplug them again and it will work, you don't want to stop the process, it only asks for the key if you haven't followed the instructions right, if you have done it right thenafter its installed and you have rebooted, when you run the game it will say checking disc, then the bar will fill up instead of saying wrong key."
,Maastah,2006-01-11T13:35Z,Crc 2005 is working. But I did it in a little bit different way. Whatever it's working.
,Slibberi,2006-01-12T17:03Z,"Kan inte någon posta en cd key? Orka göra som instruktionerna säger, jag har helt enkelt dragit ur kontakten till min dvd-läsare/brännare sen har jag senaste deamon tools med all options on, spelet startar säkert bara den får en cd key... det är onödigt att hålla på att bränna...."
,Godspeed*,2006-01-19T16:11Z,"Hmmm....
Starforce du vet.... Jag tror inte det finns någon key ute som du kan använda dig av än...
gör som Rob2102 säger... det funkar.
Och det tar inte långt tid om du bara förstår engelska."
,Maastah,2006-01-22T20:39Z,It's working without cd-key. If you want i can explain how to do it.

,Rob2102,2006-01-25T07:35Z,"just found out something cool, you don't need to unplug ide drives or use starforce nightmare, just mount the image in latest daemon tools, leave all emulation options off and bingo, it works!!!!"
,Patton2,2006-01-27T21:38Z,"Please explain to me how it works. I'm having trouble.
After I have mounted the image using the latest daemon tools and installed the game, then what?
Please help me, I don't know what to do. I guess the first thing after installing is to restart the machine, and then....?"
,PortVortex,2006-01-31T22:31Z,"Jag har (nog) gjort som i beskrivningen som Rob2102 skrev, även provat med SFN men får fortfarande meddelandet: The key you entered is wrong...
Hur får jag det att fungera, jag har senaste DaemonTools 4.03HE, några speciella inställningar eller tillfluffningar i regedit?"
