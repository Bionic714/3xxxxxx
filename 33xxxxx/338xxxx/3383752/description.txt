Utilizing the next generation of the Invictus Engine which
incorporates its new real-time physics module, Cross Racing
Championship (CRC) will allow the player to experience the
thrills of high-speed on and off road racing across vast open
terrains. The player can contest over 60 races across six
distinct environments, ranging from icy mountainous regions and
lush countryside to parched desert areas and beaches. CRC will
appeal to Rally fans and road-racing fans with its crossover
approach to vehicles and race circuits.

CRC features multiplayer action and extensive set-up options
which are an integral part of the game, along with realistic
real-time damage and stunning graphical effects including High
Dynamic Range imaging, bump mapping, dynamic environmental
