,Jinx_Dojo,2007-01-21T17:48Z,This is a great show. Is this torrent active? Any reason it contains the odd assortment of episodes? Does anyone know where the full DVD rips might be found? Could anyone who owns this set please rip them? Thank you.

,Jinx_Dojo,2010-06-02T01:15Z,"If you are seeking the complete set of Season 1 of Taxi, you need the following three torrents:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3385398/Taxi_-_Season_1_Episodes_1-10__amp__13-16


http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4091212/TAXI_s1e11-12e17-22_%5Bretr_tv%5D

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4103396/TAXI_s1e17-18_%28proper%29

From what I have been able to ascertain, the first torrent is correct and all the names are proper. The second torrent was designed to fill in the gaps, but had all of its files mislabeled (as is explained in the uploader's comment). After properly labeling the second torrent, it becomes clear that episodes 17 and 18 are still missing, at which point the third torrent comes to fill the last gaps.

I should also note that ""11 Memories of Cab 804 pt1"" and ""12 Memories of Cab 804 pt2"" from the second torrent are mislabeled *and* redundant to proper files of ""Taxi_-_1x13_-_A_Full_House_For_Christmas"" and ""Taxi_-_1x14_-_Sugar_Mama"" in the first torrent. Therefore, those 2 files (from the second torrent) need not be downloaded and can be deleted, as they are both redundant and of significantly lesser quality.

Good luck everyone on piecing together this collection. I hope this helps."
