,beate200,2006-11-04T11:30Z,"hi.stuck on 99,9 %.please seed"
,whateva2,2006-11-19T12:09Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS MOVIE

There are no seeders. Everyone is stuck on 99.9%."
,whateva2,2006-12-03T22:54Z,"Use Winrar to extract the movie to 99% and then Pause the extraction.

Make a copy of the extracted file. Should be Claire_of_the_moon.iso.

Burn this copy onto a DVD using DVD Decrypter

The iso extracted using Winrar will delete as its corrupt"

,verade5,2007-11-22T23:49Z,"O.K.
Try what whateva2 say.....it must be OK because:
What I do: extract the movie to 99% and then Pause the extraction...
Make a copy of the extracted file. Should be Claire_of_the_moon.iso.

Than I use ImTOO DVD Ripper Platinum 4 and make divx from this and it's OK."
,afaz,2007-11-25T05:51Z,"For whom who stucks at 99.9%, do the followings:

1/ Open winrar - command- repair archive - check the box ""treat the corrupt Archive as rar""

2/ choose Extract to or Extract files in WinRAR. Extraction path and options will appear, and remember to check ""Keep broken files "" in Miscellaneous.

3/ keep extract the file even though the ""file corrupts"" window appears. 

4/ if you see the new winrar file, extract that NEW file. That's it. You now can enjoy the movie."
