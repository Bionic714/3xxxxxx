Release-Notes:
==============


Advanced RAR Password Recovery (or simply ARPR) can be used to recover the lost password for a
RAR archive. At the moment, there is no known method to extract the password from the compressed
file; so the only available methods are "brute force" and dictionary-based attacks. Here is a brief
list of ARPR's advantages:

* ARPR has a convenient and easy to use user interface;
* ARPR works with one protected file at a time (multiple uses of ARPR is possible);
* all compression methods are supported;
* self-extracting archives are supported;
* you can select the custom character set for "brute-force" attack
* you can interrupt the program at any time. Resuming is supported;
* ARPR can work in the background, using the CPU only when it is in an idle state;
* ARPR can utilise either a customizable "brute-force" approach, or an effective dictionary-based
  approach. The different approaches can be used for all RAR types and compression methods
  using AES (Rijndael) 128-bit encryption, e.g., set the password length (range) of the character set
  used to generate the passwords, and many other options;
* A multilingual interface is provided.
