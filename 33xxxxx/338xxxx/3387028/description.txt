Eighties teen romp involving Bill and his new apartment, 
Jim and his rebellious antics, Tom and his crazy self, 
and Anita with her older man David.

Not my usual material, but for all you 80s nostalgia junkies, 
this film is hard to find.  Available at best on a shoddy 
VHS, this is a DVDR transfer and is pretty clean.  It's also 
better known as the sequel to Fast Times At Ridgemont High.

Besides, Lea Thompson sells donuts.  Ever wanted to fuck a
chick who sold donuts???
