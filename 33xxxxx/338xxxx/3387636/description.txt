-TAGLINE-
	The year is 1999. John Travis is the toughest cop alive...He is the only cop alive!

-WHAT THE BACK OF THE CASE SAYS-
	"After an environmental holocaust desolates the world and turns human beings into gangs of rampaging marauders, a lone cop (Ron Marchini) is forced to fight his way back to civilization with three women relying on his fighting skills for their protection. This futuristic sci fi action adventure combines the speculative fantasy of "A Clockwork Orange" with the suspenseful action of "The Terminator."

-WHAT REALLY HAPPENS-
	Did you read that? It nods to not one, but two CLASSIC AWESOME films that have not one thing in common with this film. Speculative fantasy?!! 75% of the movie was filmed in a junkyard! Suspensful action?...well ok, he did kick and punch a lot of extras. A lone cop? You're not exactly lone if you have three women with you the whole time, which might I add, not once did he make one sexist remark or attemptto get into any of their pants. Back to civilization? Maybe they saw a different movie than I did, but there was no civilization in this movie, nor was there any attempt to reach one. Sorry, back of the box: A+ for misleading awesomeness!

-Notes-
	Ronald L. Marchini, in the role that landed him 1991's sequel, 'Karate Cop' (hopefully soon to also be released :)) shows that just because you're constantly surrounded by woman, there is no pressure to act hetrosexual. Allthough he does a surprisingly sufficient job of kicking ass, one wonders what this could have been with Rowdy Roddy Piper at the helm. Adam West steals the show as his amazingly dramatic self. 

	On to my problems with the tagline. First of all, saying that you're the toughest anything when you are the only one, doesn't do too much for your credibility. It's almost an insult even. Then we have the other problem that presents itself only once you've watched the movie. Three police die. That means that in the post-apocalyptic  future, where gangs run rampant, water and gasoline are virtually non-existant and slave-trading once again is an issue, people can always rely on the four-man police nation to protect them. Awesome!
	

	This VHS as usual is mega-old, and has some audio problems. I demuxed the audio and did my best to normalize and raise the volume, but there are still some problem areas where shit is really quiet. I apologise for that, and if anyone knows their audio please do fix it and re-upload it. Thanks and enjoy!
