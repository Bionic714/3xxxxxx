,Joneseyman,2006-09-21T11:38Z,"It`s a great movie, but the last 10 minutes of the movie the codec is terrible! If someone would have an original DVDto share, I for one would download it. Would you?"
,jesaxus,2007-02-22T18:26Z,how do i fix so i can use the subtitles?
,Richard7,2007-05-15T00:06Z,"I agree with Jonesyman: most of the movie is really great quality, shame of the last 10 or-so minutes, it turns increasingly jpeggy. Maybe XVID started cramming to keep it inside a certain size or something, but a shame it is!"
