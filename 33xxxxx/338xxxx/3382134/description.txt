North Jersey mob boss, Tony Soprano, self-described
"waste management consultant," reluctantly seeks a
psychiatrist's help after blacking out. Lest he appear
weak, he must keep his therapy a secret from the rest
of the Mob. He's stressed: his teenage daughter is
giving his wife fits; his mean-spirited mother refuses
to move to a retirement community; his aging Uncle Junior,
jealous of Tony's rise to the top, won't stay in line and
engineers a plot to kill Tony; and the feds, armed with RICO,
are circling. In therapy, Tony must come to terms with the
circumstances of his father's death, with his mother's
manipulations, and with his fears of death and loss of family.
