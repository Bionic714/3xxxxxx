   With the attack on Pearl Harbor, the US military mobilized. 
   Common men rose to the challenge and became heroes in the skies, 
   seas and beaches of WWII's Pacific Theater. Heroes of the Pacific

   attack on Pearl Harbor and unfolds in epic detail through the 
   battles of Midway, the Coral Sea, Wake Island, Iwo Jima and Guadalcanal.

   lose the war. Mastery of over 25 actual WWII aircraft is crucial as 
   is maintaining focus in the thick of a 300 plane dog fight with planes 
   exploding and smoke trails blocking views. Command a squadron of 32 AI 
   planes, work with friends through online connections, or go it alone to
