This remixed version of Trek V runs 63 minutes (the same runtime as the original pilot, ?The Cage?).  The story is broken up into the traditional Trek format of a teaser and five acts.  Also, the storyline has been altered, removing those things fans found most objectionable like a certain Vulcan?s new half brother or a turbolift shaft that travels through 78 decks (when we KNOW the ship only has 21 decks total!!)

The music score has been enhanced with music from the original series, as well as many classic sound effects such as the bridge ambient noise, the planet background sounds and other effects having been added.  In addition, several special effects have been replaced.
