,Triplehammer,2008-10-24T11:34Z,"After a considerable amount of research, I found out that this is the UK 1.2 version.  Yes, the properties say 1.1 but that is a programmer error.

The second disk image is NOT corrupt.  Using Daemon Tools Lite, you need to mount the first CD image, start the install, unmount CD1 when the installer asks for CD2, click ""ignore"" when DT Lite complains, mount CD2, then continue the install.

This version does not ask for a CD key at any point.

When you're done installing, do NOT run X2.exe yet or it will install Starforce!  If you did anyway, to get rid of Starforce, google for ""sfcdrvrem.zip"".

Get the UK 1.4 patch, the No Copy Protection 1.4 patch, and the 1.5 patch from here and install them:
http://www.egosoft.com/download/x2/patches_en.php
The No Copy Protection 1.4 patch removes the Starforce DRM."
,Triplehammer,2008-10-24T19:12Z,"Clarification of the above: when you mount CD2, it needs to be in the same path as CD1 was.  That is, if you mounted CD1 on E:, then CD2 needs to be mounted on E:.  If you mount both CDs at once, one on E: and the other on F:, then you will get the corruption warning because the installer is trying to pull CD2 files from CD1."
,Raelik_69,2008-12-15T15:28Z,install wizard kepps getting interrupted.  mount the img with daemon tools lite but cannot install the game.  what gives?
,Sen-D-Tariku,2009-01-05T12:22Z,"can I play online ?
PVP ?"
,101che3f,2009-04-23T18:18Z,"Thanks for the up.
and thanks triplehammer for the heads up about the patches.
"
,101che3f,2009-04-23T18:20Z,"jdcghwjk234 you're an ungrateful prick.

nobody asked your for your review of the game.
its not the uploader's fault that you have the worst os ever."
,nickguyatt,2010-01-16T15:50Z,"i get a problem with this game where the characters in the cut scenes are just black blobs, no colour. everything else in the cut scenes, scenery and the like, shows up all right and characters look right in the com so i cant figure whats wrong. i am running quite a low end pc but with most of the bells and whistles turned of the rest of the game plays ok. very annoying cos this is a really great game. any help appreciated."
,Netot12345,2010-01-29T17:48Z,Thanks Triplehammer. Also the initial seeder ofc. :D
,hitman688,2010-02-06T08:09Z,i am having the same problem as looking54 did with his vista version can any one tell me how to fix it?
,Madmaxie,2010-06-18T20:39Z,"For the life of me, I couldn't get this to work, something about the second CD wasn't right. So I gave in and bought it on Steam, $4.99. Can't beat that price, even if it is Steam."
,macide,2010-07-26T07:31Z,"My machine is running on windows 7 x64 and i could not manage to get it work.

I keep getting ""The wizard was interrupted before X2 - The Threat could be completely installed"". I tried to burn the image, mount on both poweriso and daemon tools, changing installation directory to another partition, turning on off virus and firewall protection.

If somebody could manage these errors please inform me."
,macide,2010-07-26T08:07Z,"I found the solution here:
http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?t=178849

It seems that you need to basically carry the installation process yourself (by which i mean carrying installation files directly to the installation directory) and patch the game correctly."
,torriez,2011-01-26T11:08Z,No serial in these files. But if you install the official patch 1.2 to 1.4 then it will work.
,Nordzikas,2011-08-07T00:28Z,"Graphics problem: planets, asteroids, stations, ships, ship's console, characters during movies, stations from inside ... almost every thing is black.  Can anyone help? :/"
,PMorin,2012-03-27T13:28Z,Second torrent is much better - this one is ver 1.0 and has some problems with patching causing trouble with gameplay (for example landed and signed ships don't take off from homebase to defend it => station can be destroyed by enemy easily)
