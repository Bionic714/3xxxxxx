Updates since FlashFXP v3.2.0.1080: 

New Features: 


The graph font can now be changed seperately from the application font. 

Global "Bind Socket to IP" setting. 

Per-Site "Bind Socket to IP" setting. 

Multi-language support. See the translation forums ( http://www.inicom.net/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=160 ) for more information. 

Changes 


Syncronized Browsing. When browsing remotely the local sync now occurs after the change dir, rather than after the list complete. 

Fixes 


When selecting files in the local browsing the selection size isn't updated probably due to a syntax error. 

If FlashFXP was locked with a password and on transfer complete triggers it was unable to close properly. 

If the connection is lost during a delete operation and the user clicks yes to the a reconnect prompt, after connecting FlashFXP sometimes ended up in the wrong folder. 

Once the connection retry count was reached the 'Go' and 'stop after current transfer' buttons states weren't updated properly. 

If you connect to a site and while that connection is still being attempted click 'go' the connection attempt isn't properly reset prior to connecting to the site in the queue. 

Other minor fixes.
