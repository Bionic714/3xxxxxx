,starkoman,2009-02-14T07:16Z,"Hi olleloves! Thanks for the UL! Unfortunately, as at 14th Feb, there are (at least) six of us all stuck at 96.0% and have been for a couple of weeks...

...Please would you make it available to us once again ? just for, say, 48hours? Thank you so much! Would appreciate it muchly ? and of course keep it up for everyone else for a decently long time."
,starkoman,2009-02-28T23:50Z,Please olleloves! Re-seed this one please! It's too good not to have it out here.
,starkoman,2009-08-10T13:31Z,"Well, I give up. Looks like olleloves or his/her Big Youth seed has died a death - and some time ago. It's now August 2009 and it's been dead since January.

So... don't bother. What a pathetic waste of everyone's time - we only needed the last 4%.

96% leaves bits missing from each song.

Thanks for nothing olleloves - you owe us."
