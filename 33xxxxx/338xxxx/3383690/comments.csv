,riotpunk77,2006-01-06T23:29Z,"oh crap.... i thought this was the book... not just the solutions

does anyone have the actual book?"
,aznjen629,2006-03-22T16:21Z,Hey punterfpc can you seed this again.  I've been looking for this all over.  
,iamfunny05,2006-04-20T21:54Z,"i've tried to dl this many times, and it just isnt working. it says something's wrong in the encoding. can you upload it again?"

,Software2,2007-09-12T13:04Z,"This thing is absolutely VITAL to have. I like how I can't find any place that sells it, and most textbook search engines don't show this because it's a teaching guide.

Thank you for making my life easier!"
,Jinx_Dojo,2008-02-19T01:07Z,"There is a torrent on IsoHunt that has the full book--1300 pages in the PDF, (though I don't have my physical book on me, so I can't be sure that's everything). It has chapter indexes listing 17 chapters and the appendix, so it seems quite complete. The only draw back is that it's black and white, so the nice color pictures that help in 3-dimensional calculus aren't as clear. Still, at 20MB, it's much more portable than the real book."
