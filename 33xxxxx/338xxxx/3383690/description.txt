Calculus 5e by James Steward - Early Transendentals. We don't use that one here at UCF but I know some others (often community colleges and dual-enrollment courses) use it. However, I have found that, more often then not, the problems from the "non-Early Transendentals" text are almost the exact same as the ones in this solution manual. I hope this helps ya'll learn!
