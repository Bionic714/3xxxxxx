BBC TRIO is an outstanding show from the 70's that were on the British Broadcasting Televison. I have extracted the sound from the DVD at 192 kpbs. The DVD is not an official release. It was recorded by someone that somehow placed it on the internet. 
I will make the Cat Stevens show available first and then I will place on the Pirate Bay Neil Young and James Taylor.
