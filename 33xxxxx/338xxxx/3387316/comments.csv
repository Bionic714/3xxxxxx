,massemord,2006-08-25T14:13Z,"doesnt work with my PDA. the only one that worked was john cleese. otherwise it wont copy one or two of the files. ""Error converting data70.chk The drive cannot find the sector specified"""
,jjdacl,2006-11-24T16:44Z,The John Cleese voice is a bit dodgy. Some of the sounds seem to be perfect and others seem like dodgy recordings. Is there a proper version?
,bendy1,2007-02-03T23:23Z,down loaded files but cant extract. new at this.what is the best software 
,emu007,2007-03-03T11:54Z,I have a nokia 6680 with what file splitter do you use to convert the files please???
,English_Steve,2007-05-28T14:40Z,"I've loaded these voices on a tomtom one v2 and they work OK. Just Unzip, open each individual folder and then drag and drop them into the voices folder on your device."
,polymatt,2007-08-29T15:23Z,"im after roger & tina tourettes they are well funny so i have been told anyone can get theses plz be so kind to email them to me @ ultimate189@yahoo.com

,Biffo,2008-03-04T00:04Z,"Thanx, THS: the Queen seems an excellent navigatrix but I think Her Majesty might be upset by your (perpetuated) demotion. Lesser royals are HRH."
,RedDragon187,2008-03-24T04:06Z,Hiya i have Tomtom on my N73 and i wanna download this to have these voices can u tell me if they will work on my fone please and maybe how to get them to work aswell your help would be great .... Aj
,sladlad,2008-04-20T12:22Z,These are fake apart from the john cleese one all the other voices are someone trying far too hard (and failing) to sound like the real voice
,flipicaneze,2008-05-02T04:22Z,"Hey just BTW, I just tried this on my TomTom One 3rd Edition.  Worked like a charm.  Might want to update the device list."
,aloggy,2008-05-05T00:49Z,Can i get maps of the USA on my TomTom 1 3rd generation if i delete some stuff off it?
,East Lansing,2008-06-29T18:01Z,"The voices work.  Previous commenter was right though, only Cleese is real.  Some of the fakes are not even close!  Still worth a download.  Thanks."
,figo7,2008-07-21T08:58Z,"The only one that is real is John Cleese, the rest is fake, but  i must say that ozzy osbourne is a damn god fake ;)"
,monkey100,2008-08-16T18:40Z,"Help!
