Reboot is a story about sprites living inside of a computer. Given the time that this aired (early 90s for the first 2 seasons, mid 90s for the last 2) the graphics are amazingly well done. Not just a kids show either.

This is the first half of season 4. Funding for the show stopped halfway through ;__;
