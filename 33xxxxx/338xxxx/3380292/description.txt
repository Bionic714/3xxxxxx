Based on the best-selling book by the same name, Dr. Len Horowitz presents the definitive exploration into the origins of the AIDS and Ebola viruses. Claims that these "emerging viruses" naturally evolved and then jumped species from monkey to man are laughable in light of the documented evidence in this extraordinary lecture. These bizarre germs were undoubtedly man-made creations, accidentally or intentionally transmitted via tainted vaccines in the U.S. and Africa. The genocidal theory of AIDS is meticulously explored within the social and political context of this stormy period of American military science. This lecture exposes the potential motives of administrations responsible for this atrocity, and the methods they continue to use to deceive and kill unsuspecting populations.
