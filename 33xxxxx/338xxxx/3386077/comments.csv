,Tuckstar82,2006-04-11T19:17Z,"Sorry, I'm a bit new to all this. Heard of this site through a friend, I found a torrent on this site with the same name as the folder you are referring to. Is this the one you mean? If not can someone point me in the right direction or possibly put the key in comments? Cheers..."
