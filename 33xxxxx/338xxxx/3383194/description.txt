This anthology collects songs from the 10 albums The Rascals recorded between 1965-1972. Included with the set is a 50-page booklet featuring rare photos and liner notes written by Lenny Kaye.

Additional personnel: Buzz Feiten, Link Chamberlain (guitar); Gene Orloff & His Strings (strings); Hubert Laws (flute); Buddy Lucas (harmonica); Lois Colin (harp); Steve Marcus, Danny Labbate, Joe Farrell (soprano saxophone); David Sanborn (alto saxophone); King Curtis, Charles Dinwidie (tenor saxophone); Seldon Powell (saxophone); Mel Lastie, Joe Newman, Steve Madaio (trumpet); Joe Bushkin (piano); Ron Carter, Richard Davis, Chuck Rainey, Gerald Jemmott, Harold Cowart, Robert Popwell (bass); Ralph MacDonald, Rocky Dzidzornu, Daniel Zebulon, Jack Scarangella (percussion); David Brigati, Cissy Houston, Tosha Thomas, The Sweet Inspirations, Molly Holt, Bruce Buono, Buddy Buono, Annie Sutton (background vocals). All tracks have been digitally remastered. One of Rhino's exemplary two-disc compilations produced during the early '90s, featuring remastered sound, copious liner notes and more than enough rarities, ANTHOLOGY 1965-'72 is probably the best available (Young) Rascals anthology. All of the hits are here, of course--"Good Lovin'," "How Can I Be Sure," "Groovin'," etc.--but this collection also gathers goodies like early rave-up R&B covers, unappreciated album tracks and unsuccessful but often fascinating singles from the group's later years, when they'd added jazz and psychedelia to their original blue-eyed soul sound. At 44 tracks, these two discs are jam-packed, and both fans and newcomers will be pleased. Wisely, Rhino used the superior original mono mixes whenever available, making this one of the few Rascals anthologies with no fake stereo
