PC-: Nancy Drew - The Secret of Shadow Ranch (c) Her Interactive

Saddle up as super-sleuth Nancy Drew for a trip out west to the Shadow Ranch in Arizona.
A phantom horse is terrorizing the ranch, leaving a trail of frightening "accidents."
Local legend says the horse has come to avenge the hanging of its master,
and that misfortune will befall whoever sets eyes on it. 
The mysterious horse tramples all hope of a restful ranch vacation for you, as Nancy Drew.
Is it a four-legged spirit from a tragic love story or is there a sinister scheme lurking
in the shadows of the saguaro cacti?
You must divine the truth from the ghost stories quickly, and question everyone you meet. 
Don't expect a straight answer from anyone.
In this high-stakes game everyone seems to be wagering that you'll be gone before sundown. 

An interactive mystery-adventure game, Nancy Drew: The Secret of Shadow Ranch puts players
in the shoes of teenage super-sleuth Nancy Drew as she investigates a string of mysterious
events on Shadow Ranch and in the desert and canyon lands that surround it.
