,Elastiekje,2008-08-08T20:25Z,"Alot is extremely exaggerated. Mind that you cannot actually ride (steer) a horse, the only other farm animals you see are chickens, and there isn´t any actual ´romance´. Though the game is cleverly set up, with nice graphics and mindcracking puzzles. Good upload! Works just fine on my old windows XP. "

                  Thanks:)"

Uninstall the game and reinstall, and this time, when asked where you want to install, make sure that you choose

C:/Program Files/Nancy Drew"

,j_c_coen,2009-04-11T03:59Z,Can someone help me. This is the first game I've downloaded that doesn't just burn straight to a disk and installs as soon as you run the disk. There's a bunch of different files and I can't figure out how to install it. Thanks.
