About:
------

This version is based on the StepMania 3.9 rc2a release and includes most of its features. Keep in mind that
this is a Work In Progress (WIP) version. This version is compiled with Visual Studio .net 2003 and the XDK.
Further some files didn't transfer here but I didn't have any problems with StepMania. These files are still
included but aren't transfered cause of the FatX system that only supports filenames upto 40 characters. If
anyone find a solution for this that would be great !

(sidenote by Iriez) I've included the supported files provided by tvstatic so that no files should error when
transfering. I also added the sample song from Xport's previous build to get you new stepmania users going.(/sidenote)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known issues, limitations and differences from the PC/Linux/Mac version:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Characters don't seem to be appearing
 - Movie and Visualisation support has not been implented
 - Packages implentation is broken
 - No USB keybourd support

---------------------------------------
Advantages of StepManiaX (by Xport) v5:
---------------------------------------

 - Virtual Memory Managment has been implented
 - Profile names can be typed with the Xbox controller
 - IP Adresses (for SMLan) can be typed in with the Xbox controller
 - Controls can now be mapped using the Xbox controller
 - Limited song editing is now supported with the Xbox controller
 - Themes are working ? (see below)
 - Faster loading
 - Possible 128MB RAM fix (needs testing)

-------------------------
Virtual Memory Managment:
-------------------------

Virtual Memory Managment (VMM) has been implented on this version with on-demand paging. This should solve
most but not all out of memory problems that occur. Out of memory errors can still occur becuase textures
loaded by StepMania (using Direct3D) are not loaded into the virtual memory and thus cannot be managed by
the Virtual Memory Manager. So, if too many textures are loaded you can still get out of memory errors.

You can edit the settings of the VMM in the file: Stepmania.ini that is found in /data/. This file is created
when Stepmania first run. Here is where the settings are:

Under [Options]:
 EnableVirtualMemory	- Enabled by default; set it to 0 to disable, 1 to enable
 PageFileSize		- default is 384; this is the size of the file in MegaBytes
 PageSize		- default is 16; this is the file of a single page in KiloBytes
 PageThresHold		- default is 8; this is the minimum size in KiloBytes for an allocation to be 
					managed by the Virtual Memory Manager

Under [Debug]:
 LogVirtualMemory	- disabled by default; when enabled it writes to the log every allocation, 
					       deallocation and page swap during execution. Set to 0 to
					       disable, 1 to enable

-------------------------------
Xbox Controller keyboard input:
-------------------------------

StepMania is now accepting keyboard input using the Xbox controller. This allows you to create profiles, 
connect to SMLan servers and to map the controls. The controls for input are as follows:

Typing (Profile names, IP Adresses):
 D-Pad up/down 	- Select next/previous character in the right most place
 D-Pad left	- Deletes most right character
 D-Pad right	- Move cursor right, by default creates a space (Profile) or zero (SMLan) character
 B		- Set most right to space (Profile) or . (SMLan)
 Y		- Select next character to type in order of lower-case, uppercase, digits, symbols (Profile)
 A		- Select previous character
 Start		- Accept input
 Back		- Go back

Mapping Controls:
 D-Pad		- Select control to map
 Start		- Choose the control to map and then press the button you want to assign to it
 Select		- Go to the previous screen
 A,B,X,Y	- Clear the control

You can only map controls with the first controller ! So if you want to map the Player 2 buttons you will
have to go to the control on the first controller, press Start and then on press the button you want to
assign on the second controller.

Theme Support:
--------------

When I installed KatzeExtreme (StepManiaX Xbox version) it didn't work but maybe you will get it to work.
The next part is directly copied of the Source Package Readme:

	"Limited theme support is available in this version. Themes work the same way as in the PC version. 
A problem that is evident with the Xbox version is the FatX filename length limitation. A workaround has 
been developed for this, thanks to the addition of the Class metric for screens in themes. This solution 
assumes you have the java virtual machine on your PC.

To add a theme to the Xbox version of Stepmania, you must first have it unpacked on your PC. First, attempt 
to transfer the theme files to the appropriate folder on the Xbox. Remember which files did not transfer 
correctly. Accompanying this distribution is a java program called RenameScreen. This can be found in the 
Utils folder. Now, each file that did not transfer correctly should have a screen name prefix 
ie. ScreenEndlessBreak. To reduce the length of this file, we can rename this screen to something else. 
I'd suggest something intuitive like "SEB".

So, for each screen name that needs reducing, do the following:

1. Go to the command prompt and get to the path where the java program (RenameScreen.class) is. By default 
this is Utils in this distribution, but you may wish to move it somewhere easier like where you keep your 
themes.

2. Type "java RenameScreen [theme path] [screen name to change] [what to change to]". So, if you were 
changing ScreenEndlessBreak to SEB in the KatzeExtreme folder, you would type "java RenameScreen KatzeExtreme 
ScreenEndlessBreak SEB". This will go through the theme and change all the filenames that start with the 
screen name you specified to the new name. It also goes through the ini and redir files and fixes references 
made to those files.

3. Now all you have to do is open the metrics.ini file, look for the renamed screen name header (eg [SEB]), 
and, if the class element is not already there, add "Class=[original screen name]" 
(eg "Class=ScreenEndlessBreak").

Once all the problem screen names have been dealt with, remove the files you transferred to the Xbox before, 
and transfer the new version, and you're done!

The following limitations apply to themes:

 - png files that are not png files (as in gif files that are named as png files) will cause Stepmania to 
   crash on the XBox
 - Techno Fiend will play, but the fonts are completely screwed, and some of the images (most notably on 
   the menu screen) are very distorted"

------------------------
Additional Song Folders:
------------------------

In Stepmania.ini in the data folder, there is an optional element AdditionalSongFolders. 
You can enter in a path where songs are kept in this field. The drive letter for the DVD-ROM is A:. 
All hard disk partitions have their usual drive letters.
