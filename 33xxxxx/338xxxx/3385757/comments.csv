No don't download this one!! This torrent has the DVD quality version of this awesome series. But since it is huge we need as many seeds as possible.

It is already up to like 20 seeds. The quality of this page's torrent is really bad and pixelated. Actually just a rip from the low quality version from the PBS site. The link above is directly form the DVD set. So please download from there. It will be worth it.

Thank you. :)"
