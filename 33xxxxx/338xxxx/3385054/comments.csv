,squirel130,2006-08-11T19:24Z,"to get it to work on xbox, install a mod chip. google mod chips or got to modchip.com or mod-chip.com. 
do not get the Excuter unless your getting the Xbox Dashboard. Anyway to burn download DVD Dcrypter and got the ""Mode"" menu and select write.Make sure its an ISO format file. If not use nERO OR ANOTHE PROGRAM LIKE NERO."
