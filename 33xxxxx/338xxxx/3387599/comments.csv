,Deadmode,2007-04-05T05:02Z,Thank you so much for posting this.  I've been looking everywhere for it.  You can't even buy the full series with spoken English.  When I download this I'll seed for a couple weeks as a reward to those who seeded for me :).  Thanks guys.
,Deadmode,2007-04-05T05:11Z,Can someone give some insight on mkv and ogg files plz?  Can I burn them straight to DVD?  Or will I need to convert them to another format?
,astrof,2007-04-06T06:15Z,"Im pretty sure u can burn the ogg files to dvd, if thats what u want to do.  The dl is really slow right now....the fastest i've ever seen it go is 40kb/s......."
,astrof,2007-04-07T17:39Z,"plz someone else seed, i promise to seed after the dl finishes but plz someone seed, its goin at like 7kb/s....."
,Carpe_Mofo,2008-03-08T08:26Z,"Could some people please seed this if they still can? It averages at like 8Kb/sec and since it's a 20 gig file, thats going to take forever. I intend to see it until I get a 10/1 ratio because of how slow the torrent is."
,Redlionlll,2008-07-14T05:41Z,"thanks for the torrent it is rly good awesome quality freakin sweet that i can switch between japaneese and english thank you so much

,therubydragon,2008-08-29T15:04Z,"can someone else seed, please... i'll seed after its done..."
,therealfriday13th,2008-09-16T17:45Z,"The only reason I don't download this is because it's mostly in english.  I perfer with subs, as I feel it's rare that they get the right voiceactors for the characters.  Admittedly, they do a good job with these, but you miss alot with the English on this one."
,Slash558,2008-09-29T03:58Z,How's the video quality on this?
,medgix,2008-10-22T23:12Z,"Quality is fine, and yes I agree with the english chatter - but the nice part about it is that you can change the audio to japanese if I remember it correctly. Been a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong ass time since I watched it and don't even know on which HDD I've got RK anymore.
Cool that people still havent forgotten about this awesome anime =).
