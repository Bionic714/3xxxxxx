Elizabeth - Selftitled 1968
1968 release from this US band from Philadelphia. This is a highly competent album of rock music with some excellent fuzz guitar and psychedelic touches. Of particular note is the awesome "You should Be More Careful" which ranks as one of the greatest US psych guitar mind warpers ever made !

This is a fairly standard late sixties rock album with a few highlights such as the fuzz guitar extravaganza on You Should Be More Careful, the rather haunting Alarm Rings Five and the final track When All Else Fails, which is more interesting than most of what has preceded it. Originally from Philadelphia they moved to New York, where they recorded their album. Earlier, drummer Stewkie Antoni, who later played with The Nazz, had played with them and Hank Ransome later played for Good God and Duke Williams and The Extremes.

Compilation appearances include: Not That Kind Of Guy on The New Sound Of Underground (LP).
