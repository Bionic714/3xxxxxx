but there is no install files. there are 2 folders & 1 file named disc 1 & disc 2 which have 2 files in each folder they are a bin file & cue file. the 1 file is called a nfo file. what the fuck "
,shane_m666,2011-01-17T10:13Z,Got it working installed power iso it found the bin file so i could burn it and install the game.
,chocomuffin,2011-04-06T14:43Z,"hey:) , i got it downloaded, > mounted the first cd...> got it installed too. when id like to start it, it asks for the 2nd cd. so i mount that too. however the autoplay doesnt work. so it kinda ignores the virtual driver and keeps asking for the 2nd cd. 
(the nop.exe in the Disk2>Autoplay doesnt do anything) :( any suggestion? "
