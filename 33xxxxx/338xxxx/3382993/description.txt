Relive the tragic collision of cultures of the Mohawk, Seneca, Penobscot, Oneida, and Wampanoag with the Europeans who branded them savage for their non-Christian lifestyle. The Native Americans come together to recount the history of their Northeast ancestors: from peace to persecution to their assimilation and loyal participation in the American military conflicts from World War I to Desert Storm.
