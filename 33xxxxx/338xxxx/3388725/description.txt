A movie mix from Bitburg driftweek (Germany).
It contains for example: BMW M3, Opel Manta, Toyota Corolla, Audi Urquattro and lots of old BMW 325:s. 
If you are a drift freak, then download it.
Me and my friend "Samy delux" can now proudly present the best moments of drifting.
And as you can see after you download it - we are no pros, we only do it for fun!

Peace yall // Larssen (der Schwede)
