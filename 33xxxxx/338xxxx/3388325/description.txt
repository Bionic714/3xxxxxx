LSC is a new re-releasegroup. Our goal is to re-release/re-seed .torrents which has died in the enormous informationflow on the internet.
We will never claim to have done any new releases, because that is not our goal.

We will work for emancipating knowledge for everyone, so that students and information-loving people will have full access to texts, ebooks and written knowledge in general, therefore we feel that it is necessary that somebody constantly re-seeds relevant material. Our primary target is danish students, which is why we have chosen to pre-fix all of our re-releases with "vidensdeling".
Vidensdeling.nu is a new danish site which tries to politicise the practise of students sharing knowledge, information and e-books by digital means. 
We encourage all danish users to support the project.


We will however will point out that we have *nothing* to do with Piratgruppen or Vidensdeling.nu, except for the common goal of keeping information free and available for everyone to share.
