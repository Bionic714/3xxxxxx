Blue Note's Greatest Hits doesn't limit itself to the recordings Jimmy McGriff made for the label during the late '60s and early '70s. Instead, it culls from his Sue, Veep, and Solid State recordings as well, making it a definitive overview of his career as a gritty, funky singles artist. And, as Greatest Hits demonstrates, McGriff could create a monster groove, making his singles intoxicating slices of funky jazz. All of his R&B hits -- "I've Got a Woman," "All About My Girl," "Kiko," "The Worm" -- are here, as are lesser-known singles and terrific album tracks, resulting in a compilation that isn't just a terrific introduction for neophytes, but also a useful retrospective for collectors.
