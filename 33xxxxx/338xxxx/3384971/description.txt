Akanoid shooting out with 4th album!

Probably one of the best Akanoide releases ever - this album is groovy, funky and will be definitely one of the Progressive highlights this year! Nice atmospheres, smooth guitars and dreaming pads - rolling through track to track and slowly hypnotising you as father album goes.

A Must for every Progressive Trance DJ!
