Murder By Death is not a murder mystery. It is barely a spoof. It is, however, an homage to the writers, performers and producers of those trustworthy detective movies of the 40's and 50's. Neil Simon trucks out the gallant cliches of the film noire and presents them in the context of a gathering of the finest detectives from film and literature.

Don't look for realism, rationale thought or logical sleuthing. You won't find it here. You will find one liners, silly scenes and a thoughtful thanks to those early mystery writers who gave us Sam Spade, Nick and Nora, Miss Marple and Charlie Chan. By the way, to truly appreciate this movie, it helps to be familiar with "the Thin Man", "Casablanca", "Murder on the Orient Express" and most of those other glorious films of the 40's.

Let your expectations fly away, sit back and listen to the banter. Murder By Death plays like a radio drama with silly twists, fabulous characters and a little whimsy.
