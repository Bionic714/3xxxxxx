Release Notes:

With originality as a template, BVS took its layered, grooving cabin-fever
creations into producer Matt Ellard?s (Motorhead, Morphine, Converge)
studio to put together Terrorhawk--the group?s most accomplished record to
date. Building on the Fugazi meets Motown rhythms and grooves associated
with the group?s debut LP (Right Now, You?re in the Best of Hands...),
Terrorhawk contains fifteen tracks of a weathered and harrowing mixture of
post-hardcore and rollicking rock fused tight with gut-wrenching soul,
which further defines BVS as a group of individuals that is greater than
the sum of its parts. While the sound on the new record will be fairly
familiar to BVS?s ever-increasing devoted fan base, Terrorhawk is an
amalgam of the group?s collective musical passions and obsessions--ranging
from Black Sabbath to The Commodores.
