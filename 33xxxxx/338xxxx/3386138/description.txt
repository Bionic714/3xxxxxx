My Life for Aiur - By Cronoss

This is so great; none that loves StarCraft is ALLOWED to miss this!
This is way beond any usual fan fiction! This is Zerg vs Terran, and it is great. Iv'e read the official Terran Starcraft Speed of Darkness by Tracy Hickman, this is better! This is the full book-length text - 12 Chapters...

Recitation from Chapter 1 - Firestorm:

Chau lightning was unparalleled throughout the Koprulu sector for sheer force - and brilliance. With its coming, Ethan was shocked at what he caught glimpse of: thousands, perhaps millions of milling insects, clambering up over a ridge hundreds of meters away, a sheer carpet of death. And then it was gone, absorbed by the blackness"

Enjoy!!
