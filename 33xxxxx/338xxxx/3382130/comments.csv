,nychef77,2008-08-04T23:31Z,"Thanks...A true Genius who needs all the credit in the world. A shame, like all greats, his death brings attention to his work. Not to say he wasn't known... I recommend any Bergman film, maybe starting with the Seventh Seal of Course. Anyways that's my two nickels...Take it for what it's worth...

Thank you for the seed, much appreciated!
