Description: Alma, a young nurse takes care of Elisabet Vogler, a famous actress who for inexplicable reasons has stopped speaking. Their co-existence in a remote seaside house becomes more passionate and complicated as tension builds up between the two women. As their relationship evolves a strange osmosis occurs; their identities begin to merge and the distinction between their separate personalities becomes blured. This film is a full-fledged display of Bergman's considerable cinematic powers. It is not one of those that you are going to forget soon.
