"Consider me a fan of the more fringe and extreme movies in circulation. 
I guess it's more of a curiosity factor than a genuine fondness for the grotesque. 
That very curiosity is what lead me to watch this movie. I'll say right off that 
there is almost nobody that would find this "enjoyable" and anybody that does 
needs to be locked up. But it is definitely a movie that lives up to its reputation. There's no spoken language and the picture is shoddy black and white. 
The only soundtrack consists of everyday farm noises and organ music that sounds 
like Ned from South Park singing while drowning in a tub of grease. Yes, it's that weird. Then we get to the actual "plot". A lone farmer with a bestiality fetish rapes a sow on his farm only to confront the offspring, his emotions about the sow, and a horribly disgusting habit of drinking tea made from his own sewage! 
No reasons are ever given to the man's motives and nothing is ever explained. 
For example why does this guy enjoy putting doll heads on pigeons? 
But as far as the sicko movies goes it deserves a high spot. If you watched Salo: 120 Days of Sodom and shook it right off this may be your next conquest although for the life of me I don't know why anybody would purposefully seek this out. Then again I did so nevermind."
