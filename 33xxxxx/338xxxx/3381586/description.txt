These are the drivers CD for the Audigy2ZS sound card. This 7z archive contains two sets bin/cue files. the SB_INSTALL set is the base drivers plus the Creative software package. The SB_INSTALL_EAX is the EAX 4.0 Advanced HD Driver.

I'm providing ISOs for the CDs because from what I understand, in order to install the drivers from Creative's website, the original drivers from the CD need to be installed first. That, and a friend of mine requested for these so here you go!
