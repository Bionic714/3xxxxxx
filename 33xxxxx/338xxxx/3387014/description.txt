This is a very user friendly email program that in this reviewers opinion knocks the socks off of Outlook. With Incredimail you are in total control of what your email looks like. The Incredimail website includes a gallery of different letter styles you can choose from. They are all free to download. You can choose from several different mail notifiers to let you know when you have new email.

You also get emoticons that are built in. This is one of the only email programs I know of where you can use your mouse to write your own signature for your emails. This program supports both MSN and Hotmail email accounts. There is a premium version available for purchase through the website, There are only a few differences in the premium version. With the premium version you can preview your email messages on the server instead of downloading all of them, and you can skin Incredimail, You also get V.I.P. Support which only means that your emails would get answered a little faster, You still get the same courteous and quick support just not quite as fast. Yo
