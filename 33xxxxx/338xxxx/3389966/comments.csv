,srw567,2007-07-14T08:20Z,"I would like to thank the author of this torrent. I had a hard time getting a good copy of this in a DVD Shrink or ISO version and then you came along a did a smart thing by running it through FairUse. (I assume)....... Anyway, it is an easier download and easy to record in clear chapters covering every aspect. Nice job."
,srw567,2007-07-17T08:21Z,"Yup...it's me. I'm back again. 

What the Pirate Bay community needs is MORE membership support. This is a GREAT site yet to many of you DON'T re-up (seed) and to often make snide remarks at each other for something that has been offered to YOU....for FREE...by a MEMBER. Here's a new idea. Just don't be a taker. Try participating in what's going on on such wonderful sites as this as well as other torrent communities. I hope with the authors blessing I can up this on a different site (full credit where it is due) and continue downloads such as this as well as others that command support.  "
