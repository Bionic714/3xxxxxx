,Hicks,2007-11-22T08:07Z,"I can re-seed this if you all want. I'd have to shrink it again though, meaning that you would have to download everything again, since it wouldn't be the same content as in this torrent.
Please reply if you want a re-seed."

[V],velvetfog,2008-03-12T00:33Z,"Please seed!

16 people are stuck at 96%"
,psuedopod,2008-04-17T05:45Z,WTF?  Would it really kill someone to let those of us stuck at 96% finish?  It would only take 10 minutes of your time!  Please!
[V],velvetfog,2008-04-23T01:47Z,"I have joined this torrent twice, and each time ended up deleting everything because I got stuck with 90 something percent, without being able to complete the download. I would really like to get this disc. Start a fresh torrent for it if that's what it takes, but don't leave people hanging without being able to complete their download.

This is the most unique, and strategically important film ever produced by Disney."
