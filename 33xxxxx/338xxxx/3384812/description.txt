For those interested in physics only; This is an interactive .iso of Stewen Hawkings book "A brief history of time" where the computerised voice of S.H. (he has ALS) is telling the story, guided by animations and pictures. Topics strech from the Big Bang to super-string theorys and also a lot about the history of physics.

Made by Crunch Media sometime in the 90's. Think it was made for W95 of W98, but runs fine on XP as well.

For reading enthusiasts, the book has been published on the web:
