,Shammah,2007-09-17T03:00Z,"Wow that is a lot of Roms, like every hacked version I know of and 100s more I never seen before. Thanks, I'll be seeding this for a while."
,SatanX,2008-02-13T14:42Z,postaldude9 is a dumb cunt. I downloaded this and it works great. I'm using FCE for the Xbox to play them
,alienjesus,2008-07-17T04:11Z,"fucking awesome TYVM

I used NEStopia though instead"
,elmonster13,2008-07-31T06:32Z,"hi. ive been downloading sega,snes,atari,n64,and gameboy emulators and roms.i just install the emulator, chose the game and play it. but what am i suppose to do with your torrent when it is in iso format. i would like to know so i can start playing battletoads and other old skool games"
,tripper511,2008-10-15T22:57Z,It's a good download but has a lot of copies of itself.  It has every version of Super Mario 3  which is great for a collector but redundant if you just want the roms to play.
,mynameisalan,2008-10-22T00:15Z,"Absolutely awesome upload!!!! I'll be seeding this one for weeks.

Not to keen on the packaged emulator though... I'll use NESTopia...

Since there were about 800 NES Games ever released in English, I presume this includes all of them, and then some more... Until I've downloaded, is there anywhere I could see a list?"
,bpanther,2009-02-16T05:33Z,any one remember the 101 games cart where can i get this is it on this download?
,Hezkore,2009-07-18T20:50Z,"It does NOT contain any Japanese rom files, which was a huge letdown for me.
Otherwise a fine Torrent."
,[RO]RAPtile,2009-09-16T21:08Z,many thnx
,Zanmato,2009-10-23T20:06Z,Does it work on PS2 if i burn it to a DVD? :)
,5h4d0wHunt3r,2009-12-08T16:02Z,well im getting 400kb/s ...
,5h4d0wHunt3r,2009-12-08T16:04Z,"@elmonster

just download daemon tools and mount your image, or u can just put it on a disk"
,The_Pastmaster,2010-02-12T16:15Z,Awe! The emulator don't work on x64 systems :(
,Anjalena,2010-05-31T04:58Z,"I am incredibly thankful to whomever put together this batch of NES ROMs. Every other batch I've downloaded over the years has been a huge mess of files with unorganized and incorrect file names, mixes of versions, and tons of hacks within the list. It always made searching for the ROM you wanted difficult, and often times the ROM hadn't been translated well or would hang up or not work at all.

THIS batch of ROMs has been meticulously labeled properly and organized into separate folders according to country. The hacks are in separate folders from the regular ROMs so that they can be found easily by those who want them, or ignored by those who don't. All of the ROMs that I've tried so far seem to be in great working order and have good translations. I can't say that for all of it, or even most, since I haven't played lots of them. But I have a certain amount of confidence that most of these will be good, working ROMs just based on the amount of time and effort put into this batch.

For those interested, here are the directories within the torrent:

Australia/ Canada/ Country_Unk/ Europe/ Hacks A-L/ Hacks M-Z/ PC10/ PD/ Pirate/ Sweden/ Trained Hacks/ Translated/ Unclassified/ Unlicensed/ USA/ VS/ World (sorry for the weird listing style)

Great job poster! Much respect and mad propz. =)"
,Woden501,2010-06-11T09:10Z,Many thanks.  I can't wait to throw these on my Android phone!
,ZZp4l,2010-06-19T22:10Z,Fast download and it seems like it works fine as well... will stay and seed some as well. :)
,ntrushn,2010-07-13T22:53Z,what do i do with it once Ive downloaded it i know this sounds like a noob question but i just dont know what im supposed to do with it now
,ntrushn,2010-07-13T22:54Z,ohh! sorry DYLUCK thank you very much for your upload I am very appreciative of it
,.Angelus.,2010-08-20T05:35Z,"if you want to play these games with a controller, get a x-box corded controller and use the x-padder software. works great"
,ReDbEaN87,2010-08-20T07:42Z,"Downloaded within 5 minutes, awesome torrent

3538 pirate snacks ftw"
,fulldecent,2010-09-10T21:40Z,"Hello all, I would like to delete my NES ROMS collection since fileshare has improved much since I finished collecting. This is the original FTP site at phor.net complete list. List is at phor.net/PUB/roms.txt

Please let me know if there is anything there that isn't widely available.

Thanks,
FD"
,jshityeah,2010-11-07T23:49Z,"cool, nice torrent im getting 1.7MB/sec on this :)"
,gunmaker,2010-12-05T15:47Z,"new notice for distributers and to ALL TORRENT USERS

anti p2p organizations are now ddosing users and sending invalidated data OR VIRUSES into our torrents!!

this chocking of our extending seeding is halt !! -able!

download 

http://sourceforge.net/projects/peerblock/files/PeerBlock-Setup_v1.1_r518.exe/download

and prevent most of them from choking you, and rapidsearch for a non viral loic.exe so u can legally retaliate against them!
(ps if u do get a viraled loic.exe u can simply prune the viruses before u reboot, they sit in the main program files menu and a funny looking icon in there as well as your temp folders. simply delete them before rebooting.

THIS IS THE FUCKING PIRATE BAY! WE DONT TAKE CRAP FROM SCALLYWAGS! YARrRrR!"
,daneire32,2010-12-09T22:45Z,"hey guys im new to this.
ive mounted the iso,
wen i try to run nesticle app 
i get dialog box saying the system does not support fullscreen mode?
any ideas?"
,daneire32,2010-12-09T22:51Z,"oh sry 4 double post but
wen i try run dos4gw app a black comand box pop up for a second then closes "
,Nexxion,2011-01-13T02:31Z,"daneire32, as a rule of thumb, don't use the applications that come with ROM packages. They're usually out of date, and often are customized to fit the user that distributed them. Find an NES emluator, download it and put it somewhere on your computer. Inside, create a rom folder, and take all the files from the torrent and throw them in there. Then run the emulator and open a game. 

Thanks for the pack dyluck."
,SteXmaN,2011-01-15T16:02Z,thx
,linkinpark187,2011-03-01T15:21Z,"I'd recommend heading to http://www.emulator-zone.com/ and downloading either NESTopia or Jnes.  Those are the two best NES emulators I've ever used.  But thanks for the roms, dyluck.  This is a really good collection!  :D"
,tehteh123,2011-04-22T07:26Z,"Why did you put it in an iso file? First off, this isnt ripped from a disc, or meant to burnt to a disc. Second, if you would of put them individually in a folder, we could of downloaded the ones we wanted."
,mrdreamers4u,2011-06-26T23:53Z,is this for the ps2 to burn onto dvdr to play on modded ps2 or does anyone know where to download a nes emulator (not snes) for ps2 to burn to dvdr's not cdr's??
,doomsdaypirate,2011-08-23T19:56Z,"Thank for uploading, I missed playing all of my NES games. This brings back memories."
,Cgamertnt,2012-01-01T21:35Z,it best that you probably should download the best nes emulator google it
,.shell.,2012-03-28T09:15Z,perfect !
,ZomSean,2012-05-11T03:13Z,"Thanks bro im so happy i can go to this website

nyan.cat"
,MaxDistortion,2012-06-02T23:45Z,"Since other Pirate Bay users are so kind as to mention that the torrent works but not bother to mention how to get it to work, for those of you who don't know how to unpack the file, get any old image mounting emulator such as Daemon Tools Lite. Just mount it like any other image and you will be able to peruse the files."
,bass_hit,2012-07-11T16:32Z,Fantastic job! Thanks! I'm seeding this like crazy when I'm done :)
,SuperEazy0,2012-07-22T00:47Z,What do I exactly do when I finish DL?
