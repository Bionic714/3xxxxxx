,NukedPlayground,2008-10-15T11:08Z,"finally got it downloaded, but I'm having trouble on the install...any help would be appreciated.  I ran the install off this file and after crazy Japa-mania, I clicked the top icon with the smiling girl to install it (I think, I'm not sure because I don't read Japanese).  I found the folder that it installed to, then ran the unpacker, but still haven't found installation program for the actual game anywhere."
,NukedPlayground,2008-10-15T12:02Z,"disregard the previous statement.,,but now I'm having problems actually running the program.  I start it, I get the Capcom screen, then a screenshot of the game in red, but then it crashes.  Any help would be appreciated..also I have Windows Vista Home premium 32-bit, an AMD Turion 64 dual core (1.8 ghz each), GeForce 6150 (64 mb), and 2 gigs of ram."
