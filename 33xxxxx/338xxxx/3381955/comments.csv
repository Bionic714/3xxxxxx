,martynwhittaker,2007-08-22T16:03Z,"Hi,
I have an original cd of this game a store copy.

After install using the shop bought cd it says about not having direct x 8.1 or higher.
I think it is a flaw with the game not any dl's.

I hav'nt been able to get round this even after emailing the producers"
,Knyte6426,2007-12-07T06:15Z,"You have to download the DirectX9 fix. Just do a search for ""Starfleet Command 3 fix"". I'm sure most file site still have it for download. Filefront, Fileplanet, etc."
,t3_m4,2008-01-02T00:42Z,"filefront has a fix for it type ""starfleet command 3 directx 9 fix"" Google that ul sort you out or for better game performance get the ""build 534b"" mod from filefront kicks ass makes the game so much better in every way and helps alot also it has a nocd crack built in been playing this game for years never get tierd thank goofymax you are a leg-end"
