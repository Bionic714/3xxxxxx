This is an edited (improved) version of the English subtitles for the film Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. The subs are based on the widely distributed translation by Jasconius, with reference to several other translations as well. Most known translation errors have been fixed, while all dialogue is generally cleaned up from its original rough form. Recommended for both first-time and repeat viewings to help give a clearer understanding of the film's plot and dialogue.

To view the subs, simply download a subtitle-compatible movie viewing program, move the SRT file and video file (not included) to the same folder, and give both the same filename.
