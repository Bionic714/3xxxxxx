Contains:

The Fly - Live at the 'Stop Sellafield' Concert - 4.39
Even Better Than The Real Thing - Live at the 'Stop Sellafield' Concert - 3.50

I did not put the song "City of Blinding Lights" since almost every U2 fan has the "How to Build ......" album.

These tracks were recorded live at the 'Stop Sellafield' Concert at the G-MEX Centre, Manchester, England on June 19th 1992.
