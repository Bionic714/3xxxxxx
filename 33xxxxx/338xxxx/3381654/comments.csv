Each chakra responds/corresponds to a specific keynote: 1st Chakra: Keynote C, 2nd Chakra: Keynote D, 3rd Chakra: Keynote E, 4th Chakra: Keynote F, 5th Chakra: Keynote G, 6th Chakra: Keynote A and 7th Chakra: Keynote B. I noticed its effect on my body as soon as I turned on the CD. My chakras responded immediately, and I felt it physically - really strong and powerful."
