This is HANDS DOWN the BEST meditation CD I have. It's absolutely incredible. From the first note it instills a beautiful peacefulness that is unmatched by any other music out there. The music is clean and has an immediate purifying effect. It is absolutely a pleasure to listen to actively or just let it fade into the background and relax the entire atmosphere. When this CD is on, I can completely melt into just being and enjoy every moment of it. It helps me meditate if I choose to, it helps me fall asleep if I choose to. I will also try to use it when needing to concentrate to study -- the effect of the music is so purifying and cleansing that it leaves you relaxed and refreshed and ready to face whatever comes your way. This was the first CD I bought by Steven Halpern, and it has impressed me so much I am now looking for all of his CDs. You won't regret buying this one!!
