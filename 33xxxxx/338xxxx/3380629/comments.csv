,blomkvast,2006-04-05T20:06Z,"it says ""AUDIOTRACKS: English, French, Japanese"" so, yeah, I guess we can assume that.."
,zake88,2006-04-13T21:19Z,Hur tittar man på den hära filmen?
,zake88,2006-04-14T13:38Z,"Hur väljer man japanska med svenska subtitles?

om man bara ser på den blir den bara med engelsk dubbing."
,Kahonda,2006-04-17T02:43Z,a bit more speed when seeding would'nt hurt you know.. ;D
,zake88,2006-04-29T12:48Z,Is the more literal translation (according to Japanese audio) when it's wisewoman instead of oracle?

,Brentan,2007-05-23T18:49Z,"Spank you dude! ;)

Kanon kvalité, och bra film.
Hade ingen förväntning eftersom jag ej hört talas om denna förut, blev glatt överaskad.

Keep up the good work."

,Shrewo,2007-10-15T17:59Z,"When I unzip it with winrar (the same way I've done with lots of movies and other files) I just get one single .img file called ""tftmononoke.img"" and.. what the hell am I supposed to do with a 4.3gig image file?

What am I doing wrong and how do I fix stuff? ;D"
,Shrewo,2007-10-15T18:04Z,"Ok nvm.. it was just that the first time I was opening it with VLC player it didn't work. I deleted it and re-un-zipped it :p

Then it worked. First it's an intro that's like 22 secs and then the movie starts and it says 2h 13min or so :)"
,sologat_27,2007-10-19T09:05Z,"you mount a file xxxx.img or xxxx.iso in Daemon Tools, it unpacks it again and makes the computer believe it's a DVD"

,Arxeye,2008-03-17T12:26Z,"Why is it winrar files and a winzip???

Plz help me i really want 2 see this movie:("
,barton101,2012-07-30T12:43Z,"Next time, please include English subtitles for the hearing impaired. They are also good for people who don't have English as their first language. Subtitles take up hardly any extra space and they make for more seeders because the torrent is useful to more people."
