I'm really grateful, don't get me wrong, its just not many people are going to download this so we are going to have periods where no one is seeding, like right now. Couldn't we just put it on some http server or something? I'd be happy to host it, and we could put it on some free servers and maybe someone else can pitch in with me. We could ""propagate"" it with BT but download it with servers, that way no one needs to just hang around with BT open, racking up seeding ratios of 6000.009. If you agree, could you send it to me as an email attachment? I'll put it up on my server and a few others. (that is if you don't want to or don't know how)"
