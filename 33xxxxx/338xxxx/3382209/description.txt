The 3rd album of SBK comes along with 10 dancefloorbombs in typical pumping SBK style, driving grooves, kickin basses and massive production.
Althogh you can directly feel the SBK vibe, borderline sounds absolutely fresh and new and shows the multifarious face of sebastian.
This album is defenately a masterpiece and one of his strongest releases yet. Get ready for a journey through a wellmixed cocktail of progressive trance, prog-house, UK- and psy-trance...
