,mentalwonder,2006-01-08T22:45Z,"I've installed the game but the tetriscpl cant install drivers, and it says ""make sure you logged as administrator rights"" and I am. I even created new user for admin rights but still the same problem. Can anyone help ? I've tried solving this problem for some time now."
,mentalwonder,2006-01-09T04:49Z,"I made  the tetrisemu work with deleting couple registry files, but now it says that ""Please insert original DVD of fahrenheit"", I'm losing my mind with this, is the game even worth all this ? ;)"
,arnette,2006-01-17T17:02Z,"the image file has to be mounted to start the game,if you do that before you run tetriscpl.exe and then mount the .tdf file the game will run perfectly"
,leampallang,2006-02-03T12:08Z,If you patched fahrenheit with Fahrenheit 1.1 Patch- http://games.softpedia.com/progDownload/Fahrenheit-Patch-Download-7798.html you need to use tetris v 1.1 http://cdmediaworld.com/cgi-bin/dl.cgi?f=tetriscpl-v1.1!rar and mount it with alcohol. seems to be trouble to mount image correctly with deamontools because of the Twinsector technology
