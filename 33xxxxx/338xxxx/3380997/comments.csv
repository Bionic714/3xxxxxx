,jimmyeat,2006-08-22T21:26Z,"When you've downloaded the file:
Use WinRar if the download is a lot of .rar-files
Then, when you have the .iso-file, you could use xISO. A small and simple program that turns xbox-iso's into ordinary files in a folder. Then just copy the folder to the game folder on your xbox.

I'm sure there are many other programs that works well, too, but I've never had to usa anything else than xISO."
