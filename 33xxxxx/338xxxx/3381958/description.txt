""Ghosts of Rwanda" a special two-hour documentary to mark the 10th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide--a state sponsored massacre in which some 800,000 Rwandans were methodically hunted down and murdered by Hutu extremists. The program examines the social, political, and diplomatic failure that converged to enable the genocide to occur. Through interviews with key government officials and diplomats such as UN Secretary-Generals Kofi Annan and Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, soldiers, survivors and perpetrators, "Ghosts of Rwanda" presents ground-breaking, first hand accounts of the genocide from those who lived it."


Shocking and disturbing documentary that will make you feel very angry and ashamed but highly recommended, everyone should see this.
