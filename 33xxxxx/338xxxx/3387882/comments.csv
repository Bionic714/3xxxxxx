,NeverEnuf80,2008-05-18T10:11Z,"Wow that's sad. M4A's are superior to L.A.M.E. 320kbps mp3s even at 192kbps. How low did this person go to make them sound bad? I don't understand why people aren't just ripping everything in M4A lossless (450-700kbps per channel) like a lot of the blu-ray audio tracks.

Why does anyone rip MP3 below 256kbps or AAC MP4 (m4a) below 192kbps? And why not just lossless m4a's or mp3s? If someone downloads a lossless track and can't afford a good music device that can play back vbr files they can recompress them to whatever bitrate they need. :-?

Super pathetic. No one's on dialup anymore (at least not in America...perhaps peasants in china have dialup still), don't be afraid to seed the real thing!

Sadly I think people don't really understand the difference or even know how. :/"
