,miss_drew,2008-09-08T17:02Z,help! i always get the incorrect path to INI something. can somebody please help? i really spent a lot of time downloading the game. i hope i can enjoy it..
,xXAngelicEvilXx,2008-10-03T02:58Z,"You are getting the errors because you're installing the game in the wrong place.

By default, when installing these games, they are put just in the C:/ drive.

Uninstall the games then reinstall them, but this time, change the destination folder to C:/Program Files/Nancy Drew

If you do not have a Nancy Drew folder, create one."

,Scary69l,2009-08-16T20:46Z,"The problem I am having after installing is that if I quit and want to play later it tells me to insert Disk 1, anyway to get around this? Thanks"

I had this problem too with the older games since I am running windows 7.  This problem tends to pop up for those who are using vista or 7.  What you need to do is go into your documents file and create a folder with what ever you wish to call it.  I prefer the name of the game that is going in it.  Once done, run the setup untill it gives you the option to browse for where to instal it.  Go through your directories till you find the file you created and install it there.  It's worked for me on a number of the older games.  Hope this helps. :)"
