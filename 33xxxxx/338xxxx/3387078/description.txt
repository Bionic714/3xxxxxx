11 digitally remastered tracks recorded between October 1967 and May 1968 - missing only "Korn Ring Finger" from all known Strictly Personal cuts. The CD was compiled and annotated by John Platt. Note that track 11, "Dirty Blue Gene", is actually an early version of "Ice Rose", from the 1978 album Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller). "Dirty Blue Gene" was the actual label on the original tapes, so the labelling on the CD is correct. The Magic Band often swapped song-titles around, as must have happened here.
