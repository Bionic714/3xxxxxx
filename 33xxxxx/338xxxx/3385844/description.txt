To summarize: this album kicks ass.

Michael Riessler plays clarinet and his music is diverse and covers several genres. Basically, he plays contemporary classical music, but often fusioned with jazz or other genres, in many cases with a brilliant result. His musical strayings cannot easily be compared to those of other artists. 
This is his most recent album, but he has made/participated in a number of discs earlier. Sadly, most of them are rather difficult to find.

Enjoy!
