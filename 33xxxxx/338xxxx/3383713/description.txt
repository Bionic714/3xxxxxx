Note


This movie may look as an original scene release, 
which it isn't. I've ripped it myself, and quality 
is exactly what you can expect from a good xvid so 
don't worry! I've been ripping movies for a few years 
now so I know how it's done with a good result.

Please seed this movie if you like it, at least to
1.5-2.0 ratio would be nice so others can download :)
Sharing is caring! Also, a comment is always welcome!
Of course I encourage anyone to share this unaltered
release in DC rar hubs or whatever since I've 
followed the scene rules.
