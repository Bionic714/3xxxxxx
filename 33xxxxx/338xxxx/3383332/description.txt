The first handheld iteration of Konami's top sports title, this PSP version of Winning Eleven (known as Pro Evolution Soccer in Europe) will feature the utter realism, intuitive play and fast-paced action of the ever-popular series. The handheld version will also be almost identical in terms of available clubs and international sides, with 57 national sides lining up alongside 136 club teams. The highly-competitive multi-player aspects of the game are highlighted using the hardware's wireless systems. Challenge rival players (via an ad-hoc wireless connection) to games, with all data related to match results ? goals for, goals against, wins, etc ? retained in a running tally. Solo players can also hone their skills within six different leagues and a host of cup tournaments, and the PSP game can also be linked to the PlayStation 2 version for data exchange of created teams for play on either version or for trade with friends.
