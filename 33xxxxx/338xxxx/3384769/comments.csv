,blemishednicely,2008-06-13T03:21Z,"Ohh, man I love this game but it is such a bitch even to find for purchase, the graphics tip was dead on th money for me (XP/Dxdiag), so now I'm feeding sectoids to chryssalids, and it's all thanks to you IRGhost, you are a god! *just e few things though* I am not complaining, but I thought it was the gold pack, which is supposedb to have a seties of games on it but so far UFO Defence/Enemy Unkown is the only one that will play as it just runs from unpacking and there seems to be no setup.exe in the pack. Is it ALL the Games, or just the one ripped from the pack? 1 is better than 0, so I'm not whining but if the others are there, I'd like to find them. Also, on my PC it seems to run quite fast, even when slowed down in the gameplay menu, any ideas on how to slow it down just a little bit? For every one else, I haven't been able to ""net"" much lately, but I'll seed whenever I can. Awesome!"
,blemishednicely,2008-06-17T02:30Z,"Not trying to dominate the wall here, but beyond my game pack, and game speed question, does anyone know where I can find a site where they got a SEEDED version of ""COPS 2170""? I can't find it for purchase either, so I'm banking on a torrent. Thanks again IRGhost, I love it!!!"
,420weedlord,2009-01-06T03:50Z,"I need some help. The game works and plays fine except I can't save. When ever I go to load my game no saves appear. I can start a fresh game, save, and then immediately go to load and all the save slots are empty. What am I missing? "
