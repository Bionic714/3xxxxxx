,Stevo24,2007-08-06T22:18Z,On the Pirate Bay that is. Probably on page two or three when you search for the keyword Halo
,Stevo24,2007-08-06T22:26Z,"Seriously, the keygen on that comment page works!!! I swear, it worked for me, and every map except blood gulch works (just download it off of the internet or on microsoft.com).
