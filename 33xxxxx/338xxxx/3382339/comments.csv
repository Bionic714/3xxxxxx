Anyone know where one can find the Readiris 11 Asian edition?"
,akhnaten,2011-08-11T00:28Z,"Works for me on Windows 7 x64.  How? Well, I right-clicked on the installer and crack.  I set it to Windows XP SP3.  Then I ran the installer after clicking on run as administrator. I then DID NOT open the program but copied the crack into the Computers/C:/ProgramFiles/Windowsx86folder.  Find the folder for Readiris.  Put it in that folder.  Then run the crack as an administrator.  Just leave everything alone and hit crack.  Boom! Done! It works.  Thanks so much eChel0n0ne!"
