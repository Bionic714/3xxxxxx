,pinkey11,2006-01-31T16:42Z,does anyone have a crack to this game?! really need it
,fezetec,2006-02-08T14:54Z,"bjorgsin: the description you provided doesnt work. Everythin works until I supposed to disable the cd-rom. I dont use starforce nightmare, I do it manually. Got the creeps of STN.
Anyways, after that I enter one of the cd-keys, and then it asks me to reboot to finish the installation, and so I press yes.
After the reboot it doesnt work. Its checking the cd, and displays an error...

Please help!!"
