I'm currently seeding 2 2 and alternating with 2 1.

If more of you could seed these I can get round to 2 4 faster.

It's amazing how so many people seem to download and then stop uploading when they get the full download for themselves.

This is a comunity where we not only get what we want but help others to get the same.

Regards,

Bernard."
