Note:  I figured a show like this isn't really appreciated for it's visuals anyway so I'd just try and make it as small as possible.  Let me know if you could see any reason to make it a bigger (higher quality) file.

Episode 61
Premiered September 23, 2005
Guests: Willie Nelson, Rep. David Dreier, Christopher Hitchens, Katty Kay, George Galloway, Andrea Mitchell


On Hurricane Rita

"There is another storm now, as you know, Rita, about to devastate the Gulf Region again. President Bush said our prayers go out, to the executives at Chevron." ? Bill Maher


On Vice President Cheney

"The other event that has people on edge this weekend, Vice President Cheney will undergo surgery for an aneurysm. And while he is under anesthetic, a man named George Bush will be in charge." ? Bill Maher


On the Jet Blue Emergency Landing

"We had a little disaster excitement ourselves here: The Jet Blue Airliners. An airliner full of passengers had to make an emergency landing because the landing gear got stuck, and the irony is, the crew said it could easily have been fixed if someone on board just had a pocketknife." ? Bill Maher


On Foreign Oil Dependency

"We have two cars, my wife and I, that run on vegetable oil. She has a Volkswagen. I have a Mercedes. They've never had anything in them expect 100% vegetable oil. Our bus is run on 100% soybeans. So there's no reason for us to be so dependent on foreign energy." ? Willie Nelson


On Margaret Thatcher

"In the 20 years or so I've been in the House of Commons, by far the best performer at Prime Minister's Questions, was Mrs. Thatcher, who more than half of the country hated. But she could wipe the floor with the opposition leader before breakfast." ? George Galloway


ON American Leadership

"In this country, a smart leader is suspect. That's just the way it is. Even George Bush's father, who was a lot smarter than the son, had to sort of prove that he wasn't that bright." ? Bill Maher


On Critiquing the U.S.

"We're not running our country down when we criticize it. We're trying to make it better." ? Bill Maher


ON GEORGE BUSH

"His eyes are so close together he could use a monocle." ? Christopher Hitchens

"Christians believe in the Prophets, peace be upon them. Bush believes in the profits and how to get a piece of them." ? George Galloway
