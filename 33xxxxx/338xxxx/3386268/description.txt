This album was released only on vinyl, and then discovered, quested after, worshipped, encoded and now uploaded by me. A true find for anyone into Idiot Flesh, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum etc etc.

This is the first Idiot Flesh release I know of, and different in some cases from the formally known Idiot Flesh releases. Although the music is the same, you can feel where they experimented; some experiments went on to be standards for the band, other experiments seem to have died with this initial release.

If you have never heard of Idiot Flesh, I suggest you download if you like any of the following: Art Metal, Goth Rock, Noise, experimental, industrial or any of the like.

I will seed until my eyes bleed.
