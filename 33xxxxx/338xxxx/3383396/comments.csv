,tech182,2006-02-16T03:20Z,Soon! But right know i have 2 jobs and not a lot extra time.   :)
,tech182,2006-02-16T03:24Z,"You are right about the virus it`s in the Mail Pass View, so just don`t use that function. This will be removed in the next release.  Sorry about that but Avast did not pick it out a that time."
,silversurfaren72,2006-05-12T23:14Z,"I really appriciate the job you have done with this installation, it is really great! Do you know any way to add drivers to this installation or is the pre ""compilation"" required? (have some raid cards I need access to and and f6 with floppy don't seem to work)."

,tech182,2007-01-16T23:30Z,"I had know idea people were still downloading this version!

I dont know if i will releasing anymore cause i feel bad about ripping off Avast Bart CD! (excelent program but way way too expensive!!)

There are number of people that have inspired themselve (ripped off) from this old build. So you may find 
something quite similar out there!

The virus warning in this ""ISO"" are false negatives!

Regards!"
