Description: Agent Lemmy Caution arrives in the uber-totalitarian state of Alphaville with a special mission to destroy the omniscient supercomputer Alpha 60. His mission is to become more complicated when he meets and falls in love with the daughter of the notable scientist Von Braun who invented Alpha 60. During his stay in Alphaville he has several conversations with the computer in which Caution's human nature comes in direct confrontation with the computer's utterly cold logic. This film is an ontological, philosophical and political allegory of the contradictions underlying western society and surprises with Godard's startling and often audacious cinematic experimentations.
