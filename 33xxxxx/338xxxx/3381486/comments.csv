,calvinKK,2008-02-07T19:16Z,get cloneDVD or some similar program and compress it down/remove uneeded extra to make it fit. Or buy a DL-burner and a DL-disc

,monkybizzz,2010-01-26T17:39Z,"I expanded with 7zip (no problem) and played with VLC (no problem - drag VIDEO_TS folder onto VLC). It also played fine on Media Player Classic, but that may depend on what codecs you have (none are needed for VLC).

FYI, 99.7% downloaded rapidly but there was no seed. 9 days later a seed appeared and download completed.

I love this movie and I'm very grateful to get it in the best quality available (which is DVD quality - it hasn't been released on Blu-Ray). There is a 1.07 GiB x264 version which is easily found which has almost as good video and is much smaller. It lacks 5.1 audio and directors commentary.
