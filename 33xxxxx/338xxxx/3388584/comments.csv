,solodad7,2008-08-19T16:46Z,When I finnish this download I'll seed it for awhile thank you for the DL
,Nuukistan,2009-07-31T19:22Z,It seems as I'd open it that it isn't a video but audio file...?
,Nuukistan,2009-07-31T19:27Z,"I tried to played it on wmp, divx, itunes and quicktime.. some of them says that it doesn't recognize the file or either it plays as audio file and not as video!

,warp9pnt9,2009-10-08T14:42Z,"K-Lite Media Codec Pack Mega v5.1.8, tried MP4/DivX 4 ffdshow and DivX v6 (support 4/5/6), tried sub-options, not working.  Next time, choose more common codec, you bunghole."
,nemozeen,2009-12-18T17:54Z,"Thx in advance, it's so hard to find these kind of video's. VLC plays anything! Even if your not satisfied, there's no need for name calling."
,mrkokuri,2010-10-22T05:57Z,thnks in advance!! :D 
,Saki33,2011-02-12T00:25Z,"Unbelievable that someone would insult the uploader for using a codec that he was too ignorant to understand. Mp4 IS a common container, and a very good one. As another suggested, VLC will play anything, and it is free. Sometimes changing the file extension to something your player recognizes will work.

Thanks very much to the uploader and I apologize from all of us grateful recipients for the one abuser. Probably someone who grabs and doesn't seed anyway."
