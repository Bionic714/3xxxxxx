Description: Fifteen years after the explosion of the atomic bomb, Hiroshima is the setting of an unlikely love affair between a French actress and a Japanese architect. The non-linear story-line intertwines striking images depicting the devastation and human suffering resulting from the bomb with the passionate affair and past memories of the two lovers. This movie deals with historical and personal memory and how war affects the psyches of human beings. It is one of the most poetic and touching films ever made.
