Audio: Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono
English subtitles are for the hearing impaired. This time I made it a VIDEO_TS folder, if you want an iso or img file, you can use img tools, I used that one on the last torrent. This one is untouched, due to it is NTSC and pretty bad picture quality.

PLOT:

Professor Quincy Adams Wagstaff has just been installed as the new president of Huxley College. His cavalier attitude toward education is not reserved for his son Frank, who is seeing the college widow, Connie Bailey. Frank influences Wagstaff to recruit two football players who hang out in a speakeasy, in order to beat rival school Darwin. Unfortunately, Wagstaff mistakenly hires the misfits Baravelli and Pinky. Finding out that Darwin has beaten him to the "real" players, Wagstaff enlists Baravelli and Pinky to kidnap them, which leads to an anarchic football finale.

ENJOY! (Or skip it...)
