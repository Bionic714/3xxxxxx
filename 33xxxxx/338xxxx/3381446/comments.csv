After MGM - DVD - title, it just won't play it.
Any other ppl who's experiencing the same thing??"
,iljutz,2007-06-27T07:05Z,"Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you guys that it lets you choose the lang but after that, the normal screen like I never played a DVD in my DVD-player. Tested with computer with PowerDVD 6.0."

,piet7104519,2008-08-29T14:46Z,zweileid: which version is this?
,zweileid,2008-09-02T12:14Z,"I downloaded this from usenet a few years ago because other versions didnt have subs.
I have no clue what exact version this is, the .nfo file is all info it came with."
,Ferneu,2008-12-28T18:10Z,Does this version has the commentary track among the extras?
,Ferneu,2008-12-30T12:52Z,"Well... answering my own question. NO, this version hasn't a commentary track. The only extras are the deleted scenes and the theatrical trailer (or was it theatrical version? Don't remember for sure now)"
,Ferneu,2008-12-31T01:06Z,"By the way, the is one fellow the on Demonoid uploading untouched versions of the 3 Evil Dead movies, plus a forth disc with some extras. I'm going to get that instead."
