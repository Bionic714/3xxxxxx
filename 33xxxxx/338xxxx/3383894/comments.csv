,xiIix,2009-02-01T00:39Z,Awesome I can't wait to have all three of these! Are there any more?
,xiIix,2009-02-01T18:31Z,"How come the vendors menu has all the options locked, like how many balls you get per game, number of tilt warnings ect. ect.. In all the other ones you can do anything, but in this almost every option is locked. Fuckin bummer dude. These machines are hard with their factory settings, it'd be nice to be able to change all the stuff like in Big Race USA and Fantastic Journey.

Bah. At least I got it I guess."
