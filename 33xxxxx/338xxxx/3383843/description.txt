Maria is a pusher, searching for love amid a world of junkies and bikers; Allan is desperately trying to stay clean after returning from an ill-fated trip across the Pacific; and Steso is torn between the only two things that give his life meaning - his drugs and his girlfriend. Hard as nails, yet shot through with a yearning, desperate romanticism, Madsen's third feature (following his critically acclaimed Kira's Reason) is like Trainspottingcrossed with Les Amants du Pont Neuf - a glimpse inside the subculture of addiction that manages to sidestep the usual clich√©s and represent the messy complexity and contradictions of real life.
