,edutiao,2006-09-10T21:35Z,"agree, no revolution is ever peaceful. violence is a weapon against the opressing classes. don't be fooled, this is an idealistic ritiscism of a revolution that changed the reality of a nation, from the backyard of the USA and it's burgoise and mafia figures, to a revolutionary land free to build a socialist society. 

If you prefer a ""disney"" like socialist discourse, be warned, fascism is just around the corner.

Pรกtria Livre, companheiros! Venceremos!"
,GarandM1,2007-01-24T05:01Z,"Guevara surrendered with no shots fired out of his handgun, and he begged for his life, like a coward. He was a totalitarian who slaughtered simply because he could. Anyone who thinks he is a hero is a fool and misinformed.  Guevara founded Cuba's ""Labor Camp"" system, which you think is wonderful because you weren't declared a ""political dissident"" and sent away for life with no trial.

I'll bet you my considerable firearms collection, kamukaze and edutiao that you don't live in Cuba. It's time to grow up and leave your sophomore year of college behind.

So how is ""Socialist"" (in actuality, Communist) Cuba coming along? How many Floridians are fleeing 'fascist' America to live in Utopian Cuba? 
Time to see the world in the reality in which it exists... the one in which Socialism and Communism has been an excuse for the ""leaders"" to plunder a nation's wealth at the expense of the common man.

Even the left-leaning ""Slate"" acknowledges the fetid piece of filth that Guevara was. Grow up, you laughable little children.

Speaking ill of the dead is the height of cowardice"

Of course the world should remember Earnest Lynch (aka ""Che Guevara"") - as a thug and tyrant, a liar, an emotional manipulator, a destroyer of civilization.  He was a delusional murderer no different from Hitler (also a socialist) or Pol Pot, only less successful.  He helped bring poverty, misery, tyranny, ignorance, and early death to millions of people!  Anyone supporting him should be blacklisted.

Socialism is so inherently inferior that it cannot compete with capitalism through free choice.  Capitalism, like science, is based on open inquiry and recognizing the consequences; socialism, like religion that it is, is based on emotions, brainwashing, and corrupt power!  The only voluntary socialism the world has seen is a small dirty hippie commune, and even there most were still living on their capitalist daddies' credit cards!  Socialism cannot exist without tyranny, repression, censorship, even genocide, and relative poverty on a massive scale!  Due to reduced quality of life, Billions of people go to an early grave because of socialism!

Latin America is a great example - rich countries that go Communist become poor and tyrannical, while poor countries that resist socialism (ex. Chile - thank you Pinochet) become rich and free!

People who think Cuba is a good place to live have no business living and voting in the USA.  This is a country founded by capitalists for capitalists.  (The same also applies to other Former British Colonies to some degree, especially Hong Kong and Singapore.)  This is what made it richer and freer than Latin America.  

Educate yourselves.  Read Ludwig von Mises, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Bastiat, Hayek, Ayn Rand, the Friedmans, and other capitalist / libertarian economists and philosophers.  I challenge you to stop being brainwashed commie patsies, to study all sides of the issue, and to think critically and logically.

I too was once a left-winger and an ecotard.  Socialism is the default position of a naive and emotional mind, but a rational and open mind cannot remain socialist for long!"

Cuba is far from a dreamland and Che was not perfect, but you would have to icepick yourself in the head to come to the conclusions of these two yahoos..."
