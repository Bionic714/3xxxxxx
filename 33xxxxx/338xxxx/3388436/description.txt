In this stylish, eye-opening documentary, Nestor Almendros and Jorge Ulla present a vision of Fidel Castro's Cuba that may shock some viewers. Over the course of the film, thirty victims of Castro's powerful regime give testimony to their horrendous treatment and horrible conditions in nearby Cuba, all falling on deaf ears here throughout the rest of the world. From former comrades to artists, the voices in NOBODY LISTENED all paint a harsh portrait of the controversial leader, and challenge other countries to step into the fray.
