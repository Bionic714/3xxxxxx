,1eyedfishstick,2012-05-29T21:13Z,"What kind of moron would use an obscure container format that most people have never even heard of and that VLC, a player that plays pretty much anything, will not play?

Now we gotta fuck around and try to figure out how to convert this shit to something usable or find and install some bullshit codec that will only ever be used one time.

The vast breadth and depth of human ignorance never ceases to amaze me. Jesus Fucking Christ people are stupid."
