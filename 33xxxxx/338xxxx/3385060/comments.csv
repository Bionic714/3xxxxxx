,bellaL,2008-01-09T20:09Z,"So this is Season 2 of 5 in Spider-Man: The Animated Series? 

I sure do like the old CARTOON, but I've gotten used to this animated thing where MJ has like a short hairstyle and the voice of Harry is Ian Ziering from the Beverly Hills 90210.

I really do hope this is the ANIMATED series and not the Cartoon.

Thanks for now!
