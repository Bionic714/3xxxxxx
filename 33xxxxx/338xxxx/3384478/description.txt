For ModeA, who so wantingly asked for a superb 2003 Fall Concert!
This is my favorite from that leg; have a listen to Desolation Row and you probably get what I mean

Recording has been remastered by yours truly; even if the WAV version is superior,
this MP3 version doesn't stand back more than a few feet...
