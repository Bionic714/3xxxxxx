Since the early 1990s, Mark Koernke - often referred to by his nickname, "Mark from Michigan" - has been one of the forerunners for the patriot movement. Through a combination of shortwave radio broadcasts, widely distributed videotapes and personal appearances, the university maintenance worker has used his speaking skills to spread his message of "New World Order". Koernke was one of the leaders in the birth and growth of the militia movement and achieved widespread attention after being "mistakenly" linked to the Oklahoma City bombing. Since then he has suffered numerous setbacks, including prison, but still maintains a loyal cadre of supporters. This is a lecture by Mark Koernke about the U.N take over of the U.S, gun control and concentration camps for U.S. citizens.
