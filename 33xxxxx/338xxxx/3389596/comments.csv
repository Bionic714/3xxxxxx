when i load the new bin (FFIX Disc 2) it automatically goes to the ""insert correct disc CUATION!!!"" screen, what a bummer... i wish there were a way"

,richhie,2008-01-17T06:45Z,"This game is not for the Xbox it is for the PSX/PS1 use and emulator and I did see a tutorial on a forum on how to get around the error of switching the discs here is the link for the forum search the forum for the tutorial http://psxemulator.proboards54.com/
When changing discs (CDs or images), first you need to click the File -> Eject CD command, then Insert CD image or Insert CD drive as appropriate. pSX still occasionally crashes when doing this, though, so if you get the opportunity to save just before switching discs, do so - you can usually use such a save to start the next disc with if the switch doesn't work.
download the emulator from here: http://psxemulator.gazaxian.com/"
,richhie,2008-01-17T06:48Z,For those of you who have questions about emulation email me at in_the_depths_of_hell@hotmail.com or add me to msn messenger inhellweroam@messengeruser.com I will help if I can
