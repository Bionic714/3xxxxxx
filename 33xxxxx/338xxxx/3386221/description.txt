Adolescents - Live At The House Of Blues

http://www.inflammablematerial.co.uk/catalog/images/AdolescentsDVD.gif

Having formed in the post-punk era of the 1980s, the Adolescents have subsequently become something of a punk legend. Based in Orange County, the band stuck strongly to their roots, and adopted a feisty "no sell out" stance which stood them in good stead with the legions of hardcore punk fans who flocked to them. This reunion concert captures all the energy and enthusiasm of the band, as well as delivering an awesome selection of their best material.

This is a great DVD from a great band, I used dvd-shrink to encode the main show (didn't bother to include the extras) and compressed it down to 1.6gb.

Best of all burn to dvd-video.

2) Go to the video-ts folder and drag the dvd files into nero.

3) Inset dvd-r and burn.

4) Watch on large tv with max sound  

Great sound and video quality.
