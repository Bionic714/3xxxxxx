                                Notice to All
                                =============



We have decided to stop taking request. 

This is due to several reasons, one of which is the comments / lack of comments 
posted on our torrents. This is not the only reason! 

We will continue to post a few more requests, then we are going to 
"CLOSE THE SHOP" here at The Pirate Bay.                                           

Maybe we will continue our service on a different site. If we do, we will 
invite selected users to follow. No need to ask if youÂ´ll get invited!!

We both have had tons of fun supplying you with these add-ons and we have met a few
new friends. We appreciate the support given from some users.
But to all good things must come an end.

Please don't PM us to stay, we both have decided to do this and it's final.

Please no more requests, all new requests will be deleted without reading.

Good Luck and have fun with your FS Simming! We hope we did our part... 

PopArt ;-) and Mogz
