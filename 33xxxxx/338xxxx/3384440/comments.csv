This site is great because of what it offers _ but to using all my bandwidth (probably got tht wrong) for days downloading nothings really does piss me.

I do abuse and use this site but would love to know how to download stuff to it for other people I have used macs for years but only in he print trade and so have great knowlege of programs but jack shit of the operating system (redundent  repro mac operator) but alas still have (old!!!) copies of quark, illus, freeh, photosh etc ? basically if anybody out theere has the time to explain how this all happens be really greatful!
