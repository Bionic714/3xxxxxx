This is a set of three Pimsleur programs. It's the same as the one posted under
http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3331419 however those files are (mostly)
stereo (not necessary; it's two identical sound channels... this is dual-sided mono
with no pretenses at being stereo). I've also re-sampled them to a lower bit-rate;
(32 Kb/s VBR mono, equivalent to 64 Kb/s stereo). And I've fixed the ID-3 tags because these were very inconsistently labeled so they would come in all over the
place in your music library. 

Please keep seeding. I think this will be good for people who don't want to download 
such a huge file. And there is really no noticeable loss in quality. So you can fit
all tracks on one MP-3 CD or on a flash-memory card, etc.

Good luck.
