XBINS-TIRC:

This was a script made for those who wished to completely make connecting to xbins automated. 
This was a 3 week project and is now very reliable and stable. 
To use it type your desired and permanent nick in the nick dialog on your first start. 
From there you can have it automatically do it all, 
or have a dialog that starts up and you can use that to connect, 
join #xbins, msg the bots, and join the other channels.
