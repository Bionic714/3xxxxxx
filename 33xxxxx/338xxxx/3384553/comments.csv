,flipicaneze,2007-05-13T04:31Z,"This is a dead torrent, I had been waiting what I got for months then quit and then tried again for the last week and everybody is still waiting at 95.3%.  Why cant we just get the last 4.7% seeded to us?  
Ive just found a source for a real copy of this album, I will be sure to seed it up after ripping in high quality.  Keep looking for this in the next week."
