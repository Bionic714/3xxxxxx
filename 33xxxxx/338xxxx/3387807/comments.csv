please?"
,MattSeamless,2007-07-03T20:04Z,"Hi, good work on the upload!

If any of those 1465 peeps who have previously downloaded it all fancy seeding that'd be grand! 

I've chosen to download it in parts, starting with SAC, hoping that that may ease the load and speed things for all.

Cheers"

,hawthorn-slappy,2007-12-13T08:34Z,"If anyone out there still has this lying about, a few of us are still in love with the idea of getting it. Seed? Pleasey-please?"

,xxLennxx,2008-03-10T18:36Z,please Seed =\ theres only 2 seeders!!! Geez guys...
,Vulcan262,2008-03-22T06:29Z,"The .mkv is the best, for the noobs that don't know, if your system doesn't play it you may need to get this codec pack: Combined Community Codec Pack, that is the best pack out there now, in my own opinion, it lets wmp and other media players recognize the .mkv files, now if someone could get Nero and Other big companies that make media burning software to recognize them, would be great. I use Nero 8 for its ability to make great discs and menu's. Oh medgix this is the best setup for GITS, but missing the last two episodes from the Second Gig, and the third movie Solid State Society. But no problem, I already had the movies."
[T],despo1ler,2008-03-22T13:01Z,"why hasn't any1 uploaded an all english language GITS pack yet? cant even find SAC 2nd gig with english dub despite it being shown on STV anime channel repeatedly for months now. I have 1st series english dub but need the 2nd gig series and english soundtracks to the individual eleven and laughing man movies in order to have a complete english dub pack, if some1 can help me with these pls email on owendack@hotmail.com"

,Jakelol,2008-09-02T17:16Z,Is it in Jap or Eng?
,pudgeface,2008-11-06T23:45Z,I downloaded the first movie.  Had to get the CCCP for playing .mkv in windows media player.  Works great.  Unfortunately the movie is in English!  wtf.  Still downloading the rest.
,pudgeface,2008-11-07T18:44Z,"Never mind, I'm dumb.  The file has both Japanese and English tracks.  I just had to choose the Japanese.  Still working on getting the subtitles functioning."
