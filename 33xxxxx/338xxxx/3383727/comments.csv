,dons20,2011-04-08T01:40Z,"@cReaTive_
When you download it, you have to extract it if it is compressed (I don't know if that is so beacuse I haven't downloaded it) then patch it using ESR disk patcher or Memento disk patcher. Both you can search on google to download it, or just search here at thepiratebay.org for either. Only one you nedd though. I would reccommend ESR disk patcher. After you patch it then you burn the .iso image to a dvd-r. DVD+R works too but im not too sure about that. Burn at 4x preferably or 8x. A rule is to burn at half the maximum avaliable burn speed of the dvd so if the max is 8x then burn at 4x"
