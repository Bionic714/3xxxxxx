,Winterpool,2007-09-06T20:45Z,How can I may download this game?
,LucaviX82,2008-02-28T18:41Z,"ePSXe doesn't properly run this game, it's not on the compatability list. However you can get PSXeven (and use all your ePSXe bios and plugins) from ngemu.com. Check out their plugins section and click advanced to customize your plugins if you have problems running it or with the default controles."
,ineffiable,2008-04-24T01:43Z,Can you uploaded R-Type Delta?
,xyuix,2008-05-31T03:22Z,thanks man ive been looking for this game
,favsoul,2009-04-08T21:41Z,Incompatibility with ePSXe confirmed.  Please test your torrents and make notes.
,Valmarith,2010-01-04T17:14Z,"Works great with PSXeven

If you already have ePSXe you can get PSXeven from emulator-zone.com and simply transfer all the plugins and bios via copy and paste.

You may need to get a controller plugin as PSXeven starts you off with a keyboard setup. I highly recommend the SSSPSX PAD Plugin as it's extremely easy to set up and compatible with XBOX 360 Controllers. Simply add it to Plugins and go to Advanced Options to manage your plugins.

This is only one of several great games you'll need a second emulator to run. No one PSX emulator can run everything, and sometimes switching between emulators can resolve game breaking issues."
,magnumrev,2011-04-08T07:15Z,"Hello uhm... its a bit stupid question, i'm just new at emluators, im just wondering... I used a pSX v1.13 emuator to run this game.. it works perfectly but i noticed that i can't seem to choose a kingdom, everytime i run the new game.. after the blah blah blah of these two people... im automatically directed to the yellow kingdom or from king dryst.. is it the first kingdom to be played before anything else or is there a problem??? And i noticed that at the main menu the x button or the select automatically executes it.. to direct mo to the game.. TY... for replies.."
