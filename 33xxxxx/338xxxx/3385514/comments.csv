,Massacrack,2008-11-02T13:44Z,"i changed compability to windows 98
but still won't work
i'm using vista ultimate ...
any idea ??? "
,tariktax,2008-11-06T11:14Z,"I solved ""Program will be terminated"" problem. When you install the game mount the CD3 and run soldiers combat upgrade 128. When you install the upgrade download 1.28 game fix from megagames. Select trainers, then letter S, page 10 and find Soldiers heroes of world war 2 and click game fixes and download v1.28 game fix and just crack the game with this downloaded game fix."
,Hukkapoika,2008-11-30T20:32Z,And how am I supposed to make Vista run Windows98 compatibility mode?
,Tintin_26,2009-05-22T06:31Z,"Thanks for the upload!

This actually worked fine for me on Windows XP (SP2). Here's what I did:

- Mounted the disks with Daemon Tools.

- Installed the patch.

- Copied the crack into the game folder.

That's it. The game plays great on my old P4 system with a GeForce 7300GT video card."
,Elwood.,2009-06-19T22:28Z,"Hey everyone, here are the steps to successfully install the game. 
1. Once done downloading, go to CD1 folder and double click the first Winrar file, should be named rld-sol1.rar or rld-sol1.00, open either one and drag BOTH contained items back into the CD1 folder. Then mount the image you just dragged. 
2. Do that for cd2
3.Do that for cd3- But, I'm having problems with the game crashing on startup, so I'll skip the included patch and crack and install the retail one from a download. I'll just mount the image each time I play and see if that works. "
,Elwood.,2009-06-19T22:47Z,"Oh, follow my above comment, but BEFORE step 3, make sure you go to the install main menu and click play, it will then prompt you to restart, let it do so. If you don't, the game wont start."
,Elwood.,2009-06-19T23:40Z,"Lol, after all that work, still nothing, I'd leave this one alone guys...Don't go through the hassle."
,StillFree,2009-08-03T15:42Z,works fine for me... win xp sp2
