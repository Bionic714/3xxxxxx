,dryocean,2006-10-18T23:07Z,TY MEDGIX FOR RESEEDING i owe u one
,medgix,2006-11-07T22:53Z,"I just would like to add that I've been sending this torrent for like 6 months now and I'm tired of it, bitch at me here if you want me to reseed and I'll open it again... doesnt seems as popular as it should be~"
,darth_carnate,2007-01-02T06:02Z,"I've been looking for this series for sooo long.  Thank you, medgix, and please keep seeding."
,Vesuvan,2007-04-12T04:48Z,Please Please Reseed. I have been looking for this for a couple years now (saw a random music video and didnt know which anime it was). Please reseed!
,spelldragon,2007-06-04T19:25Z,"I agree, please reseed.  This is an amazing anime, and it's very strange it's not more popular.  It's hard enough to find just because searching for X gets you everything but this anime (X-men, X-files, Samurai X, ect.).  Hopefully this goes up again."
,xcd,2007-06-27T23:39Z,"cmon i looked everywhere for this! when i saw it good time ago i didnt know witch anime it was, but when i just found out its not anywhere! pls i beg one of you to seed this one last time! medgix or someone other that completed the dl, thanks "
,medgix,2007-07-04T19:40Z,"lol funny guys, I'll see if I can find it again :P"
,medgix,2007-07-04T19:41Z,"ok found it, but will only seed for 1 week... not that many downloading so~"
,Vesuvan,2007-07-15T12:21Z,Damn did I miss it? Plz reseed I will be leaving azureus on just for this!
,Vesuvan,2007-07-20T02:27Z,man please reup. if anyone posts asking for it after i dl I will seed for them! this is the only place i have found this at.
,medgix,2007-10-05T15:45Z,"Vesuvan, give me your email or something... I cant keep seeding theese files since no one is dowloading it. Waste of bandwith, memory and energy x)... "
,gabanna07,2008-02-13T19:45Z,please reseed thank you so much
,medgix,2008-08-04T12:52Z,"If I get more then 5 comments from different peeps in 1 week I will reseed this torrent for another 6 months, thats a promise ;)"
,Incvisitor,2009-01-28T22:58Z,"Somebody, please, seed a bit!!
