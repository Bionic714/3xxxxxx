Ok, let's get one thing straight, the quality of these videos are dreadful*, so no complaints ok**: it will only lead to no more Matt Furey stuff being uploaded, and you wouldn't wanna miss his "Secret Power of the Handstand"-video now would you? :)

*Not so bad though that you can't make out Mr.Fureys instructions

**If YOU can provide a dvd-quality rip, be my guest :)
