Same movie as buxton69's, but because of hard drive constraints I had to compress and convert it to AVI.  I figured some of you would rather have this version than none at all, as people don't seem to be seeding.  The quality is nearly as good as the original and the resolution isn't bad either (608x464).

Please seed!
