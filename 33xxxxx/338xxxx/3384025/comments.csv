,plutonine,2008-05-27T08:12Z,"the file opens in VLC media player.  The problem is that the audio is in German, and the quality is terrible.  There are also no subtitles.  

I would recommend looking elsewhere for this film. 

maybe: http://www.sumotorrent.com/en/files/392204/Woody%20Allen--MOVIES.html"
,faried,2008-11-02T08:31Z,The movie has German and English audio tracks.  Your player probably has a way to switch between tracks.
