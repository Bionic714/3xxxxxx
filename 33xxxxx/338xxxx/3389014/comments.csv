Some incomplete songs, and others have HORRIBLE skips in them.  I've listened to 6 tracks off this torrent, and 3 of them are butchered."

,ezekiel1986,2007-05-30T02:24Z,"metalzero, was this before the torrent was complete? In case it was, then it is no wonder. You will always have skips'n jumps in incomplete torrents, be it mp3, avi, mpg, wmv or whatnot."
