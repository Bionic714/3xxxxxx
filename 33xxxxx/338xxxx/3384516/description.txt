    Winning Eleven 9: Ubiquitous Evolution brings many of the features from 
    the PS2 console version of Winning Eleven 9 to the PSP. Match, league, 
    and training modes are present, and much of the gameplay is the same. 
    Some tweaks have been made to make control easier with the PSP's analog 
    stick and button layout, and records and rankings can be stored on the 
    Memory Stick Duo. The most exciting thing about Winning Eleven 9:  
    Ubiquitous Edition is the ability for players to whip out their PSPs 
    anywhere and connect wirelessly for ad-hoc matches. Now next generation 
    soccer gaming can be had anywhere, anytime!  
     
    Rls Notes: Well the DMU wasnt working and our ISO is around 300 MB smaller 
               without ripping anything (Hey its Magic;)) so we wanted to  
               present it to you ;)
