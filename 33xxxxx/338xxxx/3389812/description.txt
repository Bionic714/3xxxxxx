Three rare albums by the Israeli rock band "Churchills", who later changed their name to "Jericho Jones" in 1971, and again to just "Jericho" in 1972. Their music progresses from the psychedelic 60's sound of the Churchills to the hard rock of Jericho. All of these albums are very rare, and sought after by collectors for good reason.
