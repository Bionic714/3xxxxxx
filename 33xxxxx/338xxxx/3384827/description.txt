30/08/2005 - Diskv0.7 Released.
------------------------------- 
	   -Rushed release, sloppy design + readmes,

	   -More games and apps needed, and better 
	    organisation.



15/09/2005 - Diskv1.0 expected release. 
--------------------------------------- 
	   After the successful release of v0.7 (admitidly 
           on some sites more than others) v1.0 is compiled. 
           
	   Although this in itself could have been an
	   excellent disk, I suddenly had a surge of new
	   titles so 1.0 was only online for afew days...


18/09/2005 - Disk(-set) v2.0 Released.
--------------------------------------
	   -Plenty new games, 22 altogether (spread across
            2 disks this time), all tested and organised 
            for ease of use and quick transfer.
            (I'm still crawling for more games though, wait 
            for v2.5 disk(s)!)

	   -New & improved Apps + Tools section.

            -New artwork!

	   -N00b-friendly approach 
	    (more peeps = stronger scene, cant be bothered 
	    with this 'fuck off n00b' attitude)

At the present time the PSP scene is growing stronger
and stronger everyday although, until the xecuter 
memory board mod is released, there is still the pressing
issue of storage for games etc.

I've found that the best way to overcome this is to create
a DVD to carry around with your PSP, this might sound lame
but because of the PSPs true plug and play USB interface 
its quick and easy to swap games aslong as you can access 
a PC with a DVD drive and a spare USB point.

I have created this DVD image because i thought it would be 
useful for others.

I apoligise to the respective 'owners' of these releases as
i am, in a way, re-releasing your work but ive found this 
quite useful and i thought i'd release the image i use for 
other PSP owners.

Disk v2.5 is on the way with more games and more apps!!
