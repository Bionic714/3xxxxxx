,edo08,2008-04-06T00:10Z,"all of u ppl are noobs u need custom firmware with the latest updates to play most new games.

jeez im sick of sayin this"
,Necroclysm,2008-06-02T20:55Z,"Yeah, thats great edo8, apparently u havent tried anything on this torrent yet... since they do not work on any CFW I have tried.  They ALL say corrupted data, and iRShell wont run it in any version either.
Instead of mindlessly spouting off crap before even downloading it, why dont u wait til its done?

As for konkid, if u can figure out whats wrong, it would help a lot.  I did not try the fastloader only games yet, but none of the non-fastloader games will run in any CFW version I have tried."
