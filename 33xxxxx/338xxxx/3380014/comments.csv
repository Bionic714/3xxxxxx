,unborniwished,2006-04-05T19:36Z,"Plz keep seeding, don't let this die!"
,wol2000,2006-05-16T22:34Z,"The subtitles in this are completley different to [hAmMEr].GitS2.Innocence.CD1.[DVDRip.XviD.DTS.Subs-English&Polish].mkv
version. 
Not sure which one is the right one!"
,chris1989,2007-11-28T00:23Z,"I'd be happy if this was seeded, and I will of course seed after getting it down. Arigato"
,curtpsp,2008-10-05T02:04Z,Seed please? I'm at 99% here.
,snowbirds,2010-02-10T07:29Z,"Man!  I've been DL'ing this for about two weeks now, and I'm still only at 73.4%!  

I'm getting such a low DL speed that it doesn't even register on my bit torrent client.  It's less than 1 kb/sec...

Can someone please seed this thing with a little bit of POWER?  I should be able to finish DLing in about 1 hour, not 23 more weeks...

thanks for the up!
:)

,snowbirds,2010-02-11T07:07Z,thanks!  I'm now at 99.3%.  only 3 more days to finish.
