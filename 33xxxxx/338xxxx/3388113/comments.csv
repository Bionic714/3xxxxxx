,sedition,2007-10-20T04:53Z,I'm having a weird problem. CDisplay won't open the files. It says there are no images to display.. but if I open them with winrar they look totally normal. It's happening for all cbr and cbz files in the archine.. am I missing something?

,Rasva,2009-11-19T19:56Z,"I had problem with #26, CDisplay said archive was ""broken"". If you face that problem with any of the files, just unzip it with winrar or something(i used FilZip), then pack it again and you can open it normally with CDisplay.

There have also been few mirrored pages which you can't turn to normal with cdisplay's invert function(they go upside down), so you have to extract the image and flip it with some software.(gimp, photofiltre, irfanview.. lot's of free programs which can do that)

Other than these minor problems, this is very good torrent, and comic is great too. :) Deadpool has already become my favorite hero in Marvel universe."
