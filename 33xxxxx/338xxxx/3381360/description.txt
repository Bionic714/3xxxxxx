
Excellent quality Video and Audio until the end credits then the video quality goes bad and the time code is displayed.  DVD menu doesn't show audio (soundtrack) menu but it is on the disc.  There are three audio tracks, two english and one chinese.  But you can't select them from the menu.  You must change the audio manually.

This should do until we can pickup the REAL DVD. 

Enjoy,
