This is the Forth episode of BTV which is the Reviews, Features & Cheats program of Games World in Series 2.

Starring:
Alex Verrey as Big Boy Barry, David Walliams as Leslie Luncheonmeat & Introducing Percy the Poetry Writing Pig as himself.

The show was recorded long ago in 1994 and is reflected in the quality, you have been warned. :)

(The first half of the show is especially poor quality because it was recorded in LP.)
