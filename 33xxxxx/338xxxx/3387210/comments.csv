This the second download of original xbox game

I can burn and play 360 backup otherwise.Thanks"
,DuUkE,2008-08-29T04:21Z,"Proxp7:

You have a Hitachi drive like me, which means you can only play burnt dvd9 disks, you can still play xbox1 games, but they have to be dvd9, look out for DVD9 xbox1 games on the net, they are made especially for the hitachi drive....too bad we dont have other dvd-rom drive like benq, samsung or lite-on...they dont have a problem with playing dvd5 disks"
,Proxp7,2008-09-02T18:40Z,"Wow, thanks for your reply.Will try that next time when burning XBox 1 game.
