,thesommelier,2006-01-08T06:50Z,awesome torrent. thank you peefyn!
,Peefyn,2006-01-08T12:18Z,"Oh my, all the previous comment disappeared. Still, thanks for all the comments :)"
,albatorsk,2006-01-09T22:54Z,The mother of all torrents! Thank you!
,Khamero,2006-01-09T23:18Z,How well does this work with windows XP? Will I need to emulate it and work around issues all the time or will they run smooth?
,Peefyn,2006-01-10T20:09Z,"Khamero: You'll have to emulate it, but ScummVM is a very(!) good emulator made specifically for these games. There's a newer version than the one in this pack that I suggest you check out."
,Khamero,2006-01-10T22:23Z,"Great =)
I thank you for a great torrent =)
If I can only manage to get it until my girlfriends birthday...  D="

,spiwak,2006-01-14T00:44Z,"Can someone help me--I can't open the disc image for Full Throttle, for some reason. When I try to open it in Nero, which so far has worked for the other disc image files (Monkey Island 3 + 4, Grim Fandango), it just says it cant open the file or something like that. Anyone else run into this problem?"
,gangstax,2006-01-21T20:37Z,"Keep seeding, this collection seems nice. Hope all games work. Full throttle i got original on cd :)"

,cloudmckane,2006-01-29T00:13Z,Very nice if I can get the whole package!  Thanks alot Peefyn. But can Someone please seed? I'm downloading @ 15-20 kbps with BitComet and 8mbit adsl.
,bonkeman,2006-01-29T20:52Z,"Sweet as hell!

These are classic games that I played growing up. They are still as good as when they came out, because they are not about graphics and cool effects! The humour is often twisted and extremely fun, and the storyline is addictive!"
,MeanMrMustard,2006-01-30T13:29Z,"bearclawtlc:

you dont need to use ScummVM for monkey island 3, just set compatibility to windows 98 and mount with deamon tools, works like a charm.

and ty for this torrent, brings back alot of memories from the good ol time :)"
,Mattdk,2006-01-30T16:09Z,SO NICE! I LOVED THESE GAMES!

,Zakule,2006-02-13T01:10Z,"Looks like this has an actual disc dump of the CD-ROM PC version of Loom, which is treasure.  And yet, a disc dump of the Audio drama isn't included - just a group of crappy ogg rips.  Too bad - with the Loom Audio Drama disc dump this torrent could be truly great."

With that said - the speed on this torrent is absolutely shite!
What, no swedish adventure gamers with 100/100 mbit connections out there?"
,Peefyn,2006-02-19T01:12Z,"Thanks for all the comments guys :)
And to the one who mentioned the bad rip of the audiodrama, I'm sorry. There's probably better versions out there. If I ever update the pack I'll be sure to fix it.

,brain3k,2006-03-01T19:20Z,"These games are *classics*. Had a little issue, i'm not sure if it was bittorrent download or what. I got to cd2 of monkey island 3, and it froze the comp. Went through the usual stuff, ended up burning instead of emulating the cds. Same deal. Tried copying them over to run via hard drive: cd2 wouldn't copy. I tried ripping directly from the cd2 image - continually froze isobuster, and strangely enough the shell as well. cd2 image seems corrupt. Anyone else have this issue? You get to cd2 in Monkey Island 3 after you get the map off that guy's back at the beach - I can provide a save game to test it if nobody feels like beating to there."
,jaffarca,2006-03-03T02:33Z,SEEDA!
,MrWise.dev,2006-03-10T01:17Z,"Great torrent, Awesome games, just too bad they'r all in ZIP's instead of just seperate folders so I have to download 350MB just to get the soundtrack."

Problem: MI3 in the beginnning when u cut the rope and blast the door with the cannon, the movie displays 3-4 random frames and the stops dead. Nothing to do but to shut it down.
Is this a compability issue, cuz when i had the original discs it was on Win98, so is a Win98/95 Emu required?"
,woomba,2006-04-18T04:19Z,"Myabe I'm just retarded.. but games like Sam & Max where all you get is the Game, Covers, Manual, Walkthrough, and the Soundtrack.. how do you play those since you can't mount them in Daemon Toolz?

Thanks in Advance, Woomba"

,fruktjuice,2006-05-17T14:17Z,"Balt, I have had the same problem in the past while trying to play the game in XP but i never had that prob while playing it in win 98. so yes its probably a compability issue."

,Garkan,2006-07-09T13:34Z,"This is one of the best uploads I have DL from piratbay, maybe one of the best DL I have ever done. Really, everything is so nice performed with soundtrack, covers and ofcourse the game, all zipped. Even the latest patch for some games is there.

This is one must have if you love LucasArts point-o-click games, but also for people that have never played the games.

Thanks for the up! Tack så jäkla mycket! 
Will seed this long time forward. A long time."
,Garkan,2006-07-09T13:38Z,"PS. Maybe this has been said before, but if some games (like fullthrottle) has problem with the sound/music (speech could be interruption), download the app ""VDMSound"" (just google on it). That app emulate music and sound to old (DOS) games so it works better, much better."

,taylorson,2006-09-03T08:12Z,"Sound is messed up with Full Throttle...
When I play Grim Fandango... it randomly locks up 

I'm using Daemon Tools to run them 

Also, bittorrent locks up on me.  I'd be willing to seed this with a 20 kb/s upload rate but I can't get it to start again. 

Any help? "
,taylorson,2006-09-03T09:59Z,"Okay... this took me about 2 days to do, but I somehow found out how to run everything.

To answer the question of BitTorrent locking up:
Mine did too and I was scared I couldn't access anything.  Just open up BitTorrent, right click on the torrent, and click on view Torrent info.  In the window that pops up it should say a ""Show details"" and a ""Open Folder"" button.  Click on Open folder and if your lucky all the zip files should be in there.  Just create a folder for the games and unzip them all in there.

ScummVM loaded all these games for me:
Day of the Tentacle
All the Indiana Jones games
Labyrinth
Loom
Maniac Mansion
Monkey Island 1 & 2
Sam and Max hit the road
Zak McKracken

Once you unzip the file, there should be a folder with the file you unziped with subfolders containing Cover, The Game, etc.
Just open up ScummVM, choose Add game, then go to the unzipped folder and click on the subfolder ""The game"".  I don' think you see anything on the ScummVM window when you choose ""The game folder"" but just hit choose anyway.  If you did it correctly it'll say something about adding monkey island or whatever.  Then just play the game.  

CD Images:

Here was the tricky part.  Your going to have to use 2 programs for all the games with CD-images of game.  Download Daemon Tools V4.02 (just google it if you don't know where it's at) and install it.  Just for saftey, my settings on Daemon tools is this:  
In options, everything is checked except for Autostart and tray icon.
In emulation, click on ""All options on"".


Also download VDMSound.  Now when you unzipped (let's just say Grim Fandango) GF, you should be able to see the folder called CD-image of the game.  Open the folder and you should see Grim Fandango - Disc 1.nrg.  This is the file you should mount using Daemon Tools.  

To do this, once you install Daemon tools and have it running (you should see the icon shaped like a lightning bolt or something in your system tray) just right-click the icon, go to the top where it says Virtural CD/DVD R rom, go over and select device one, then go over and select mount image.  Browse through and find Grim Fandango - Disc 1.nrg and select it.  If all works well a window will pop up asking you to install the game.  Install it.

Now here's the weird part... I just stumbled upon it by luck.  After you install the game just don't play it and exit to the desktop.  Mount the cd-image one more time.  If what I did works, it shouldn't start the Grim Fandango window again.  If it does, exit out one more time and mount it again until the window stops popping up.  When you are able to get the window from popping up go to the folder where you installed the game.  Find the icon in the folder that executes the game and right-click on it.  If you installed VDMSound you should have the option to ""run with VDMS"".  Click on that.  This made it so I could play every game with no mess ups!

Review:

1)  Mount the cd-image with Daemon tools.
2)  Install the game.
3)  Don't play it with Daemon tools; go to the desktop.
4)  Keep mounting the image until the window that asks you to play the game stops popping up.
5)  Go the the folder where your computer installed the game and find the icon you double click to run the game. 
6)  Simply right-click and ""run with VDMS.
7)  VDMS should emulate the game perfectly.

My guess is that VDMS needs Daemon tools to act as the main emulater while VDMS works on top of it to fix all the sound problems.

Hopefully this will work for you."
,taylorson,2006-09-03T10:11Z,"I did find one problem however... don't go into a menu (aka, hitting F1 or something) too much... cause then it cuts out the sound and you have to restart."
,taylorson,2006-09-07T10:59Z,"Okay, one more thing.  I just encountered the problem of inserting another disc and here's what you need to do (at least this worked with Grim Fandango).  Just hit some keys that will bring up a new window (ex. ctrl, alt, del to bring up the Windows Task Manager for XP) that way the game will still run, it will be minimized, and you'll go to the desktop.  Simply right click Daemon Tools and mount the 2nd cd image, then open up the window for the game again and select okay (which is telling the computer you just put in the 2nd cd).  It should load up the game, but you might lose the sound.  Just save it, exit out, and restart it again with VDMSound and it should work.  "
,Sephcat,2006-10-09T16:57Z,"@ taylorson

Or you could just load both CD's in Deamon tools, you have the option to make 4 devices there, so really aint a problem."

,UnderPlatypus,2006-11-15T08:51Z,"This is such an incredible torrent it's not even funny.

I pretty much stopped playing computer games when the classic Lucas/Sierra model went away. I have no interest whatsoever in first-person shooters and I am not enthralled either with the other kinds of games that are now being developed (RPGs).

I can't wait to revisit some of those games and get to know those I've never tried.

I wonder if I'll ever get through with this download though... Keeping my fingers crossed and uploading the measly amount I currently have at a potential 50 K/sec..."

So I minimised using ctrl+alt+del, opened a new drive in Daemon Tools, mounted the second CD image into the new drive, closed task messenger, restored the game window and pressed okay. Nothing happens again. It still says that it can't find the file.

It even does that if I mount the game beforehand. Bleh."

But is this exclusively for PC? I have a MAC, with the MAC version of ScummVM on it, this has worked fine for the LucasArs games i have on disk.
I'm about halfway thru the torrent, and I have downloaded a couple of .RAR extractors (for MAC of course) and they can't download the completed files, saying it's not compatible. I thought .RAR was a universal format and yo just needed the PC/MAC extractor software"
,jooaakim,2007-07-22T10:52Z,"Awesome torrent! Love every single game in this one.

Btw, you might get an error when trying to burn Monkey 3. The problem is that the some burn programs are case sensitive and as the cue-file are upper case and the two bin-files ends on "".bin"" in lower case it won't work until either changing the cue-file or renaming the bin-files."

,ChaosClone,2007-12-24T13:59Z,"If you can figure out how ScummVM works, yes. 
When ScummVM is installed you have to mount the exe file.
For instance if you want to make Dat of the Tentacle work you start up ScummVM (remember to go into options and choose full screen as the first thing you do or all the games will run in a window). Then press 'Add game', travel to the directory of the game and open the folder that contains the exe file (example; C/games/Day of the tentacle (with speech)/game/dott). In here press 'choose' and the emulator should come up with title of the game. Simply press 'ok'. Now the game should be on the emulators list and you start it by double clicking the title.

In other games the directory might be more or less complicated but if you have problems finding it the trick is to acces the games folder and try pressing 'choose' in all the sub folders there is.

,pvt.punch,2008-03-02T14:04Z,"HOW TO GET FULL THROTTLE TO RUN IN SCUMMVM:

1. You start off with a .rar file. Extract it with your program of choice.
2. You now have a folder called ""Full Throttle"" that the folders covers/game/manual&cheats/music. You'll see in the game folder, you have a .bin file, so at this stage scummvm won't recognise it.
3. mount the .bin file using daemon tools.
4. at this stage (for me at least), nothing automatically happened. what you need to do is right-click the mounted image and select ""file explorer"". this opens up the files on the cd.
5. now you think you're set, but no! *don't* open the file called ""INSTALL"". if you do it will install the game on your harddrive and won't be emulated by scummvm (i.e. no sound, possibly other problems). instead, see the folder called ""RESOURCE""? that's got everything in scummvm needs. simply copy all the contents of this folder, and paste them into your original extracted ""Full Throttle/Game"" folder. it's quite big, 493MB.
6. open up scummvm. add the game in the usual way. enjoy!"

,Alias_Andrew,2009-06-09T15:20Z,many people (including me) had issues with playing monkey island 3. the game crushes on windows xp whenever a video is triggered and it works partially on scummVM (until the point where you need to switch cds).some said it would work if you ran it on windows 98 mode but for me it didn't. so i have tried A LOT of things to make this work and I came up with this relatively simple solution: Mount with daemon both the game's cds and copy their contents to 2 different folders (one for the 1st and one for the 2nd cd). then copy/paste the files from the 2nd cds folder to the 1st cds folder (don't overwrite the files the files named the same in both disks) except the folder 'resourse'. then open the 'resourse' folder from the 2nd cd's folder and copy/paste its contents to the folder 'resourse' of the 2nd cd's folder(again don't overwrite the files named the same). That way it's like you created a 1 cd game. Now open scummVM and lead the directory to the folder you created. start the game and you will have absolutely no problem playing it
