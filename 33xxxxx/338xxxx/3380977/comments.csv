,MaD_Snip,2006-11-15T01:15Z,PLEASE SEED!!! IM STUCK AT 45.2%.....Thanks
,loboxic,2006-11-23T17:22Z,"Have waited for 3 days long, still stuck at 45.2% ...  can anyone really seed this?"
,XweAponX,2007-03-12T22:54Z,"This is worthless. The new program is up to and probably over 85 GB in size.

If someone can find me the 2007 1st quarter DATA, I'll think about providing a crack that will work for versions from 5.5 to 5.8"
,XweAponX,2007-03-12T23:04Z,"Let me re-phrase this... It is not that this program is worthless, it is that sinister is worthless. BIG Fuck-You to sinister.

I traded the bastard back in 2002 or so for an Alldata crack. Sinister used parasox to make a crack patch for Alldata 6.x or something.

The fucking lying bastard told me that the crackpatch worked for versions above 6.0, it did not returned ""wrong file size""

However, the productsecurity.dll that wass generated by the program for version 6.0- THAT could be used, and I did, up to alldata 7.x

Watch out for these fuckers from Sinister. Paradox is A-OK, but watch out for releases that are Sisnister/Paradox - the sinister part never seems to hold up water. FUCK that guy."
,Seath,2007-04-18T00:54Z,so by the looks of when you guys posted its kinda pointless to download this

,XweAponX,2007-10-08T02:07Z,"I was trying to say

1) Piss on Sinister

2) Go to another place, where we got the last few years Mitchell uploaded, and not shit-cracked like this poop."
,XweAponX,2007-10-08T02:08Z,"Piratebay seem to not let me mention the name of this other place.

It is that OID place. Like DEMON."

,reldvs1,2012-08-02T12:12Z,"btw, tried out the floppy files and disc1 cuz it was done already.

so far, so good :) after i got the ondemand 1.0.5 or something like that ....once installed, i put in my newer 4.4 discs and it ask me for an update. after the update. all my discs from 4.4 started to work jus fine. 

too bad the interface looks like its something out of DOS, so if any one has the 4.4 or any OD version that is compatible with 4.4 discs please let me know. thanks :)"
,reldvs1,2012-08-02T19:05Z,"jus a warning to the person leeching off me. unless someone signs on and seeds the rest. u r wasting ur time. there are no complete seeds.

unless someone signs on to seed the rest, this torrent is useless.

c'mon ppl plz someone anyone seed.
ive tried sooooo many different mitchell torrents and none have worked right for me. "
