Men blandningen är hur bra som helst, hjärtligt tack."

3 of the songs (Even Meaner, Black Cat's Path & El Doomo) have an ""mp4"" filename extension.  MP4s are used by QuickTime on my Mac.  

When I inspected them, I could see they were AAC files, so I changed them to an ""m4a"" filename extension.  When I changed the extension, they popped right up in iTunes.  

Maybe that's why tzyn thought he only got 59 songs.

But, there's a song named ""Pure"" and it says the band name and album name is also ""Pure.""  Anyone know about this particular song?"

However, the other 59 are worth a listen."
