Drop dead u shithead."
,autosump,2006-08-22T19:43Z,"Ok. it's like this. Episode 27 and 28 are the same episode. Because he named episode 26 as just 26. When it's supposed to be 26-27 in the same. It's a double episode.

So the episode 27, is not the 27, but acctually the 28.
So what you gonna do? Just erase episode 27, and rename episode 26 to Naruto -  26-27.

Have to get back with with whats up with the 120 Episode though. "
