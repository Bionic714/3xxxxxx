,Haywood Yublome,2006-02-07T16:26Z,Download VLC
,Meezly1,2006-02-24T22:07Z,I have VLC and I am experiencing the same sound problem as VelvetKevorkian.  any suggestions?
,uraphake,2006-03-10T13:39Z,"The codec is ATSC/A-52 Dolby AC3.
You can download the free install app from:

http://ac3filter.sourceforge.net/

It's free and works like a charm.
Once it's installed the files will play the audio nicely. VLC is for dummies. :-P"
,qwenlander,2006-08-30T19:13Z,"It is not the UK ""version"". It's the original. Only Yankee-wankees make lamearse watered versions of popular european... well... anything.

Jesus! Why don't they keep to their astonishingly poor all-american sitcoms and shite like The Bold & The Beautiful?"
