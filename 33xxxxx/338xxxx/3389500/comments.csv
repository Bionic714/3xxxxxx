,rougexetxnoir,2007-06-20T23:23Z,"Is anyone able to burn this to CD? I can't seem to do it.  I get a message that says ' Please insert a blank disc in CD Drive'  even if it is a blank disc.  Odd, it is possible for files to be burn protected or do you just have to do something to them first?"
,rougexetxnoir,2007-06-20T23:40Z,"Wow, nevermind.  I just need to buy some new CDs mine all have crap on them."
,rougexetxnoir,2007-06-21T21:05Z,"Thank you very much for uploading this, it plays flawlessly!  (Even on a 10+ year old boom box!) Very, very good quality!"
