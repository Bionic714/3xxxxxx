New Grenada is a planned community set in the desert where there 
is nothing for the kids to do, save for a rec center - which closes 
at 6 PM. The parents, in their zeal to attract industry to their 
town, have all but neglected their children. As a result, the kids 
begin to create their own entertainment, which involves vandalism, 
theft, and general hooliganism. During an incident when one of 
the kids brandishes an unloaded gun at town cop Ed Doberman, 
he is shot and killed. When the parents gather the next night to 
discuss the killing and the level of lawlessness among the youth, 
they soon find out that their kids have had all they can take.
