,toyotomi,2006-11-03T17:09Z,Good upload.  Just a few pointers for ya.  Next time try a bit higher than 128.  And leave out the fucking advertisements for ipods.
,toyotomi,2006-11-04T11:34Z,"Also, number the tracks when you rip.  It's not hard to set any ripper to do so, and it saves people alot of work."
