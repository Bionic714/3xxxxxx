I even created new user for admin rights but still the same problem. Can anyone help ? I've tried solving this problem for some time now."
,mentalwonder,2006-01-09T04:48Z,"I made  the tetrisemu work with deleting couple registry files, but now it says that ""Please insert original DVD of fahrenheit"", I'm losing my mind with this, is the game even worth all this ? ;)"
,leampallang,2006-02-03T12:06Z,If you patched fahrenheit with Fahrenheit 1.1 Patch- http://games.softpedia.com/progDownload/Fahrenheit-Patch-Download-7798.html you need to use tetris v 1.1 http://cdmediaworld.com/cgi-bin/dl.cgi?f=tetriscpl-v1.1!rar and mount it with alcohol. seems to be trouble to mount image correctly with deamontools because of the Twinsector technology

Any 1 got it to work. There is only 3 buttons (mount, remove driver & enable/disable). How do i get it active & how do i mount it so that something happens. Like deamon tools."
