It was in a cereal I ate and in an ice cream that I had most days. I started to get very bad headaches daily. Then a friend found some information about the neurological issues caused by aspertame and showed them to me. I stopped using it and the headaches stopped immediately. I have not used it since. 
Looking forward to learning more."
