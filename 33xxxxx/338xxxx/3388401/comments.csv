,mattchazz,2007-02-12T05:19Z,There are no viruses or trojans in this release.  What toy anti-virus are you using -- something like ClamWin?  What you found is code to make it an unattended install.  Use a REAL antivirus from now on.
,staxstax,2007-02-15T05:19Z,"mcafee 2006 reports 2 suspicious files in SYSTEM32\ after installation: cmdow.exe and pskill.exe, both used for remote administration of your pc. 

other than that : BEAUTIFUL release "
,mattchazz,2007-02-20T08:26Z,"""cmdow.exe"" is used to hide windows for an unattended install.  Do a google search, you will see.  go to this page, it explains: http://www.commandline.co.uk/cmdow/

""pskill.exe"" is a tool used to kill processes.  It's a TOOL, like a screwdriver.  Can be used for good or bad.  it's probably needed for one of the tweaks.  

I understand the paranoia some people have in downloading unknown software, but you can go join this forum and read all the comments and ask questions.  The Retestrak forum has members like Sniper, eXPerience, Reatta32 -- all respected names who have released great software.  A bunch of board members came together and made this release, which is why it has the board name."

,FL_Freak,2008-04-08T18:54Z,"To all, 

This is a working windows XP. THere are no virusses,

First unrar the iso file, then you need to burn the iso image to a cd and boot from it, then install. It's best when you do a clean install
