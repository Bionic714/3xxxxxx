A small Java program for editing GIF file frame rate and loop number.

USAGE:

1 Make sure you have Java installed.

2 Download gifeditor.jar

3 Run command:

	java -Xmx200m -jar gifeditor.jar <your_gif_file> <new frame delay in ms> <animation loop count>


Example: java -Xmx200m -jar gifeditor.jar test.gif 10 1
This will loop "test.gif" once when played, and show each frame for 10 ms.

Note:
	-Loop count 0 means that the animation will loop forever.
	-If you get Java heap size error, allow more memory by the option -Xmx<java memory size in MB>m
