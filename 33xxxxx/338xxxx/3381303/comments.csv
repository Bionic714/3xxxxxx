,cjshim,2006-07-25T19:14Z,Thanks I've been trying to collect all of the HP books Read by Fry.  I only found this one here. so I uploaded Chamber of secrets.  Now there is 2... :P
,Eilenna,2006-08-07T16:05Z,Thanks for this! Does any one know where to find The Order of Phoenix narrated by Stephen Fry?
,no_nick,2007-07-02T01:30Z,What the hell is the point in divideing it up into 1100 files @ less then a MB each?
,Fireybluedolphin,2007-07-09T15:24Z,It's split into several files as it's split chapter and page. So like 01x01 is Chapter 1 page 1.
,Eonn,2008-09-21T23:17Z,"omfg, a page by page division? whats next? paragraph by paragraph? line by line? 
chapter by chapter would have been great. 
I'd rather be annoyed by the Jim Dale version "
,Crumpette,2009-04-14T03:21Z,"Page by page looks like a splendid idea, actually. It drives me up the wall when audiobooks skip to the next chapter and I lose my place entirely. Looking forward to it!"
