You will need Alcohol 120% to mount these bin files.

Mount the first CD and install the game and once it ask for the 2nd,

unmount the first image and mount the 2nd CD continue to install.

The game does not need the CD to play so once you install the game

you're good to go.


I recommend you play with a gamepad.  Have fun.
