After heavy demand, I will reseed the torrent with all Jan Johansson discs I have found online. Jan Johansson was one of the all-time top jazz pianists of Sweden, and flavoured his music with scandinavian and Eastern European folk music.

This will take a long, long time. I have a rather bad connection. PLEASE DO NOT COMPLAIN - Use Soulseek, Direct Connect or eMule if you are anxious.

And please, continue to seed as long as you can, when you have finished the download. I travel a lot and can't seed continuously.
