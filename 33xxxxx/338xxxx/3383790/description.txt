The Cart Boy

This is a "Character Development Short" of the show Trailer Park Boys. This short was made before the character Bubbles was fully formed. It was short before the first season of Trailer Park Boys. Ripped from the second disc of the Trailer Park Boys season 1 and 2 dvd set. Fans of the TPB will enjoy this. Can be played with a dvd player such as PowerDVD.
