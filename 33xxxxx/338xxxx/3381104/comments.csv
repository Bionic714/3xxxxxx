Follow these steps download-Mount or Extract using either WinRaR or Alcohol to mount it-Install-Goto GameCopyWorld_type in earth 2160 and download the latest region fix.After download drag and drop all files into the game directory_remove old and replace.After that download a KeyGen for the game_easy to find just type in KeyGen for earth 2160 and find one. Use Zuxxex(KeyGen) generate and put in the serial and then activate by phone and you will be able to play the game after you put in the Verification code. AND PLAY HAVE FUN!!!!!

Thanks. "
,HellHunterGrand,2008-06-12T15:21Z,"ah, never mind... got it. And for anyone still having trouble with the region- to go your control panel and change the time zone to GMT  (Dublin, London...) and change your region in your country settings. "

,Skyywolf3,2010-02-08T00:36Z,"A few notes: 
This torrent sort of works.

The region issue was annoying, but is easy to fix via getting a region fix from Game Copy World ( http://m0002.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_earth_2160.shtml#Earth 2160 v1.3 REGION FIX )

However, even though it launches, this torrent DOES NOT get out of demo mode, as none of the five serial/activation codes provided work. There are keygens, but most of them have trojans and are not easy to find. 

So, tl;dr: This torrent doesn't work, don't waste your time."
,alexsou,2010-02-15T10:14Z,"hi, this torrent doesn't work but you can make it work: i donloaded tnt region fix 1.7 on megagames and i downloaded a keygen i give you some working serials

1 = cdkey
2 = activation code
3 = verification code

,asif105878,2010-04-27T17:01Z,I used the TNT region fix for 1.3.0 and used the reloaded keygen and the game is activated.
,Frontiersman,2010-07-13T13:51Z,"I need some help getting this to run. I have the Reloaded keygen, but I\'m not sure how to use it, and here\'s why:nnThe keygen gives a serial#, an activation code and a verification code which go together. However, when I install the game, patch it to 1.3.8, apply the region fix (I can\'t find the 1.3.0 region patch anywhere on the Net, only this later version), run the keygen, then start the game, the following happens:nnI enter the serial I got from the keygen, then choose Phone Activation. However, I CANNOT enter the activation code given by the keygen, because the game automatically assigns one to me without my input - and it\'s different from the one in the keygen. And of course, the game expects the verification code which matches it\'s own act. code, not the ver. code that the keygen displays (since that matches the keygen-supplied activation code, which I never got a chance to enter)!nnCould some good soul give a step-by-step description on how to make this work? (And if this really requires the unpatched 1.3.0 version, then also a link to the 1.3.0 region fix?) Would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance."
,MegaX78,2011-02-05T19:35Z,Hey could someone please link me up to the keygen? I can't seem to find any.

,racergsx,2011-12-23T11:56Z,"Finally managed to get past ll the key shit. 
go on google, type in earth 2160 keygen, click the first link, sould by a long list of games and keygens with a blue backround, get the RELOADED keygen, NOT the GENESIS keygen, it's in german. 
When I used the reloaded keygen, I got to the point where I've entered the cd key and it's telling me to call a number, I kept trying the ACTIVATION code, but it didn't work. Then I tried the VERIFICATION code and it worked on the first try. F***ing annoying."

,SD-Ravana,2012-06-17T08:45Z,"I gave it a fair shake, followed every comment and tried 12 different CD, Verification, and Activation keys.

Not one worked. Folks, this isn't worth your time. Steam sells it for 5 bucks, either go ahead and buy it or find something friendlier to get running than this."
,budwar65,2012-07-08T07:43Z,What is the actual difference between registered and non registered version of the game?
