Because everybody as upload anything about kickstarts, and so on, to the Amiga, they all just dump what they got, so I expect that noone of them make succes to have all those as WinUAE V1.000 like to have, then you click on the button "Paths/Rescan Roms" for test.

I make four files.

1_ThisIsAllYouNeed.rar
2_BetterDowloadThisLatestVersionAlso.rar
3_WorksButNoUseForThemBecauseOfNr1.rar
4_ThisCrapProbablyWorkButNoUseForIt.rar

Nr 1 is enough for give you 'Jackpot' then you use the test button "Paths/Rescan Roms".
Nr 2 is just a late kickstart version of A4000. Never gives me any problems, so I use it.
Nr 3 is also as nr 1 accepted then you click on the button "Paths/Rescan Roms", but earlier versions so no reason to use them.
Nr 4 is just the rest of all what I have going through to find nr 1,2 and 3. Probably totally useless.
