Today we are giving out the sixth One Piece movie:
"Baron Omatsuri and the Secret Island"!

Neat huh? =)

Note that Balkongo-Fansubs is only presenting you with this release, all I did was rip the DVD + its sound, extract the subtitles + edit them, and encode + release it.

I got the DVD from Knives420. It was translated by the Hong Kong group, [HK].
But the English is really good! I was stunned! And the parts that could have been better I patched up a bit.

So, without further delay: Enjoy the movie! =D
Oh, and sorry about the delay of OP213...
