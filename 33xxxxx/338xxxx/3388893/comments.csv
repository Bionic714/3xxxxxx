p.s what emulator and settings do u use?"
,Zorcher,2006-08-25T04:47Z,"This doesn't seem to be completely compatible with PC emulators.  The game runs too fast with uncapped frames usually at 120-150 FPS (I have a fast PC), and the title screen looks great with no video glitches.  However, if I try to start a new game, it just sits there with a black screen doing nothing.

Any specific video plugins or emulators I should use?"
,Zinon,2007-02-27T08:07Z,"Zorcher, you can edit the FPS in the video options, I had this too when i played FF7, and I chose 60 fps, because that is good enough =)"
,Seiken3,2007-03-15T23:02Z,"Hey, I just downloaded the whole thing, and got 17 RAR packs... From there, what do i do to play the game on my PSX? I mean... Do i gotto unpack them all before the ""Play-File"" Shows up? 


I'd appreciate if anyone could help me :)"
,Seiken3,2007-03-16T16:01Z,"Hey, I got the stuff to work... Tought, I have an problem about to get the game to start. I've putted the FPS lower, and made the game go smoothly in the start. but when i press New game, I get the black screen....

,anaalitappi,2007-06-03T14:07Z,Thanks alot! Been waiting to get my hands on this
,Undefeated915,2007-09-11T23:10Z,All games run fast on my emulator.. Whats the best video Plug in out right now? That runs perfect? A perfect 60 FPS?
,SkankyNugget,2007-09-13T17:13Z,it just freezes on me everytime i try to rip it. whats up with that?
,webug,2007-12-03T19:17Z,"same here black screen after new game and vibration settings. so if anyone get this running with ePSXe, please post what bios and plugins you are using."
,webug,2007-12-04T23:37Z,if you run this on ePSXe make sure you start it from the console with the -noauto flag and it will run fine. This will save you a google search.
,sharpazz,2008-03-03T18:24Z,Do you know if this one would work on a ps2 with swap magic if i burn it on a cd?
,Promenius,2008-03-22T14:09Z,"Guys, to get this to work on the PC Emulator ePSXe, then you can do two things:

A: You can use the 1.5.2 version of ePSXe, works like a charm.

B: Make a shortcut to the 1.6.0 version, go to configurations on the shortcut, and add a ""-noauto"" line (just remove the "" "")"
,Cameigons,2008-05-09T03:49Z,I'm trying to unrar this and I'm being asked for a password... Does anyone knows it?
,Cameigons,2008-05-10T06:38Z,"Nevermind, the problem was on the application I was using to extract.. weird..... 
The game works great =)"
,reddoogg02,2008-07-20T18:05Z,Good download jsut run on psxe 1.5.2 abd ull be fine ill be seeding ;)
,Pinksirius,2008-08-01T03:15Z,Lots of hit and runners on this one... ive been seeding it for 2 months to a current ratio of 360 and it only has 12 seeders :/
,InzaneNinja,2008-10-28T00:53Z,The game works fine but whenever I go to use an element it skips horribly until I cancle. Only problem I've had so far...anyone have any idea on what I need to do here?
,kumbandit,2009-02-21T23:22Z,"For crying out-loud, stop using ePSXe and other emus, PSXfin is the best. It doesn't have advanced graphics like others, but at least it has no compatibility issues whatsoever. Plus it doesn't use plugins, and is easy to configure and use. To find it, browse on Google or such. Sheeesh!"
,kerypton,2009-03-16T23:44Z,"I didn't got this to load on my playstation, using some crappy fujifilm cd-r. On emulator this run perfecty tho. I need to try some other empty cd media. I have Matrix Infinity mod chip. Thank you! This game is awasome! Great!"

,coleix,2010-01-03T00:12Z,"Thx man, im gonna try this one. I been searching a eur version or a version in Spanish but couldn't find any."
,Holtb,2010-03-05T03:49Z,Unrar and played right away with ePSXe 1.70. Super fast d/l. Great up man thanks. Will seed. 
,leracos,2010-08-27T01:00Z,"To the two of you running on epsxe 1.7.0:

What settings are you using? I can't get disc one to load beyond the squeenix logo. The opening FMV locks it up. Disc two works fine...just not disc one. I have all plugins and have tried multiple setups, with no luck. Appreciate the help!"
,alphanovember,2010-11-11T07:24Z,"running pcsx on OS X. DL'd fine, extracted/prepared from part 1 using StuffIt and used Run CD from the .bin file, but PCSX says it's an unsupported file. Anyone have any advice?"
,Sankou,2010-12-25T03:07Z,"Thanks, this game works great. I got it running just fine on both x86 and x64 win7 ultimate computers. I'm using epsxe 1.7.0 with pete's d3d driver 1.77 (dx7). I used 'nice' sttings. I just hit 'run iso' and select the .bin. Very nice torrent all around- +1. Seeded to 1.46 ratio but had to remove to make room for others... I know, so close to 1.5. Sue me =P"
,Thetruthfinder,2011-05-16T04:54Z,legend of dragoon and the alundra games would be nice.  Amazing job on the diablo 2 torrent.  perfect
