,Profoss,2006-10-07T20:15Z,"Weird, it says I need to install Undrentide expansion even tho I have used the 1.66 patch that's on the cd. It shouldn't matter which expansions I have installed as long as I have the patch, true?

Any help would be appreciated."
,tyrion,2006-10-10T14:59Z,"doesnt playing this thing require that you paid for it, given you have to have an active internet connection?"

You need to install the expansion packs, even if you have version 1.66 installed.  (Actually you might want to upgrade to 1.68 while you're at it.)  Each expansion pack adds more content to the core game engine--Hordes of the Underdark for example adds the content required to enable your characters to progress into Epic Levels (level 21 to 40)."

When i'm done, i'll seed it for sure."
,stormy78,2008-06-18T14:37Z,So what do you do to install these? Mount each of the .rar files?
,MrTTAO,2010-11-16T20:38Z,"The requirements are wrong, they list the requirements of the kingmaker premium module; which required an always on internet connection to play.

This is a DLC pack on CD that contains 3 completely unrelated premium modules without the DRM, and thus doesn't require an active connection to play."
,MrTTAO,2010-11-16T20:38Z,"unrelated to each other that is, not unrelated to kingmaker. One of the three premium modules on this disk is kingmaker (sans the DRM)"
,MrTTAO,2010-11-16T23:00Z,"Ok, I downloaded and ran it (after fixing the cue file which was pointing to an absolute directory rather then relative... I went ahead and converted it to an ISO)...

anyways, the readme says you must authenticate online, but you do NOT. I tested it and it clearly works offline.
The install menu says ""v1.0"", however, the module itself says v1.1 (which is the latest version).

This entire farce is pretty amateurish of bioware... but it works. This is a great download even if you already purchased all those modules (which I did) because the online authentication:
1. Requires disabling peerblock.
2. Is slow.
3. Is not guaranteed to be there much longer.
4. Is required every time you load the module, this INCLUDES reloading a saved game..."
