At this point I had planned to upload Desert Hearts (NTSC) but there seems to be something wrong with the data on disc, why I can't copy it to my hard disk. Therefore, I'll upload some other things instead and hope to solve the problem with Desert Hearts later.

'Dinner Party' was originally a dvd of lesbian shorts I once bought. The shorts vary greatly in quality and style. Among others, there's the rather sweet trivial short Travelling Companion, and the main title Dinner Party which was made by Lisa Cholodenko who brought us the wonderful yet disturbing feature 'High Art'.
