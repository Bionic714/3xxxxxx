This is a best buy propaganda video the all the employees were forced to watch at 7:00am over several saturdays last month. Interesting if you ever wondered how they motivate highschool/college kids to foist service plans and such onto the customers  for minimum wage, while making their managers boat loads of cash. The smack talking sock puppet dog alone is worth the download.
