Here be an XBox game in the format of NTSC.

Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale.  A Bard's Tale.
Would ya get an eyefull o' the dubloons on that lass?  Arrr!

If ye don't know what ye be doin' with the XBox games, don't bother downloadin' this one.  I don't want to hear yer bitchin' and moanin' if ya can't get it ta work.  It be a VERY big game.  More than a standard DVD be able to fit.  You'll need to be usin' an XBox iso program and burn it to a DVD of dual layers or put the files straight on ye ol' upgraded hard drive.
