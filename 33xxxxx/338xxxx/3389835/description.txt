vBulletin is a powerful, scalable and fully customizable 
      forums package for your web site. It has been written     
      using the Web's quickest-growing, scripting language; PHP, 
      and is complemented with a highly efficient and ultra fast
      back-end database engine built using MySQL.               
                                                                
      NOTE: The group which brought you all vBulletin 3.5        
      releases so far is finally proud to present you the Gold   
      or also called Final version. If we look back it would be  
      really nice if it had the announced coffee maker support   
      but enjoy it anyway :)
