,deadorarrival,2008-07-26T14:58Z,"Hey guys. 

I installed the game, everything went perfect, but as the installation ended I simply can't start the game. It says ""ERROR - incorrect path to INI file"".
I have absolutely no idea what to do with that. Can you guys help me with that one?

I had the same problem with ""The Secret of Shadow Ranch"", by the way.

You're getting that error because you're installing the game into the C: drive, but not the Program Files Folder.

Uninstall and reinstall, and this time, look at the destination path. If it says C:/Nancy Drew, then you need to change it. Make sure you put it in C:/Program Files/Nancy Drew and you won't have that problem anymore."
