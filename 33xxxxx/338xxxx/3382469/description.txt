Kaplan Higher Score 2005 GRE
Version 6.0

This is from the Kaplan GMAT/GRE/LSAT 2005 Platinum package, but it is only the GRE CD.
This software includes lessons with test-taking tips for verbal, math, and the new writing section of the GRE.  There are also 3 full-length practice tests (math, verbal, writing) and 12 extra practice sections (6 math, 6 verbal).  All practice tests and sections include complete answer explainations which are very helpful.  The software also includes vocabulary builders and math practice.
No key is needed and this is a great way to prepare for the GRE.
