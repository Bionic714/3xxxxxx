"An insiders view of the computer cracker underground. The filming took place all across the United States, Holland and Germany. "Unauthorized Access" looks at the personalities behind the computers screens and aims to separate the media hype of the 'outlaw hacker' from the reality."

This is a well dated video about the Hacker/Cracker communty. Its still good to look back and see what the communities were like, shows you a bit of phone phreaking, lock picking etc. and shows you how the authorities deal with people of this category.
