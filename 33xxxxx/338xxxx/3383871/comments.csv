,scriptX,2006-02-17T03:47Z,"If you just want S2E13 then have your client only download that episode. If your client doesn't let you do that, then get uTorrent (www.utorrent.com)"

,phatassphunk,2006-05-30T01:07Z,"I read some comments about Episode 13 being missing, but I don't think it is.  The uploader has just counted them differently.  The first file has both parts of Wake-Up Call in it (Parts 1 and 2 in one file), leaving 12 total files instead of 13 files.  But, all 13 episodes are there."

No picture means no xvid codec. download ffdshow or k-lite codec pack at www.free-codecs.com"
,The Mezmerizer,2006-08-13T19:14Z,"OK quality and shit, but the show sucks...
Don't waste your time on this shit. I'm thinkin' the directors suck.
If you wanna se something entertaining you should download ""trailer park boys"" or ""weeds"" because this is a show for children."
