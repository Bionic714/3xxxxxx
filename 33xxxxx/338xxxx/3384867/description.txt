 -NOTES-
 
 Robots.PAL.SE.FI.DVDR has some problems.
 First of all end credits is missing. 
 At the end u get that shitty antipiracy thing ;)
 And the subtitles/audio are fucked up @ some dvd-systems.
 
 We tag this SE.UK because we decided to rip out the
 finnish audio/subtitles to give u a bitrate thats
 acceptable. We kept all extras to give u something more.
 There is a teaser of Ice Age 2 and some more things :)
 
 Reason why we dont tag it PROPER is because we dont kept the
 finnish audio, and because the NoGrp release works on some
 dvd-systems.
 But still, end credits missing!
 
 
 Over and out...
