X-NetStat displays information on your current Internet and network connections, much like the console netstat.exe program, but in a graphical interface. These connections are established each time you visit a web page, send an instant message, check your email, or do any network activity that requires you to connect to another computer. They also made when outside computers attempt to connect to your machine, authorized or not.


X-NetStat is like radar for your computer's network & Internet activity -- you can see when connections are made in & out, what local programs are facilitating the connections, and the addresses of where they came from (or are going to).
