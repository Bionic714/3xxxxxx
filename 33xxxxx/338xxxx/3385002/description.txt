Get sure you don't miss this great debut.

Altom is a new act from France. They brought already some tracks on comiplations.

The Sound of Altom is warm and groovy morning sound but also night influenced.

The massive basslines and the funkyness of this CD make Altom for sure one of the most played newcomers this year.
