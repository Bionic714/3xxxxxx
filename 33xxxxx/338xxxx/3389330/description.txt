From Cleveland, Ohio, a good psych hard rock outfit which did achieve some modest commercial success. Their first album is excellent, with surprising covers of Last Train To Clarksville, Morning Dew and You Don't Love Me, plus a good original penned by William "Bill" Constable. The Second Damnation is also interesting, with Back To The River, Money Tree and In The Morning. There's already a Southern rock feel in some songs.

After three albums, they renamed themselves Glory and released an LP on Avalanche in 1973.

Eric Stevens, who later worked with Brownsville Station, produced their albums and Bill Schwark had previously played with The Alarm Clocks.

Compilation appearances have included: Eve on A Lethal Dose Of Hard Psych (CD).
