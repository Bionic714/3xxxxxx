Description: Joe, a WWI American soldier ends up horribly maimed, armless, legless and faceless in an army hospital. Trapped in this useless fragment of a body he can only think; his memories, dreams and a limited perception of his environment are the only things left to him. Though not very well acted or directed this haunting film is striking in its originality and bears a powerful anti-war message.
