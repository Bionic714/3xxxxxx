,thecochise,2006-04-17T23:31Z,"When I'm finished downloading this movie, I'm gonna seed my ass off, cuz apparently, no one else is... If there is one thing I hate, it's people who snatch and run..."
,DJ_Sevin,2006-05-09T06:06Z,Can anyone seed this bad boy!? Please?
,Zoeee,2007-04-21T21:39Z,"great movie... Seeds, please... Its awful snatching and running..."
,cane89x,2007-06-20T19:01Z,"god....such an amazing film.  haven't watched it in years but can't wait.  and seeding needs to be done.  it amazes me that shit movies will get seeded into oblivion, yet truly incredible works of cinema will have nothing.  sad signs of the times."
,redox1,2007-07-03T21:24Z,"Wow this movie is full on. It took me a long time to find this, and lots of people want it so i'll be seeding hard for the next week... If you download try to get your share ratio over 3, this movie deserves to be out there"
,mcdulla,2007-10-08T21:31Z,sead
,Jazmasta,2008-03-20T02:07Z,"If there is ANYONE out there with a finished download of this film, I beg of you...please seed it!"

,schrade,2008-05-02T05:21Z,"Keep up the seeds please, this looks amazing, and I really can't wait to watch it."

Thanx :]"
,abyss93,2010-05-16T09:00Z,"Thanks for this one, such a great flick! Will def seed."
,h2o4go,2011-03-07T19:51Z,"Thanks A hell of a lot to the uploader and the seeders! DLing now and speed is good for my connection. Will seed for as long as I can. Does anybody know if that 2008 version of this is an actual remake/movie? Trailor looks retarded, like a play..sure does not give much an idea as to what direction they took it..."
,h2o4go,2011-03-07T19:56Z,"For those wanting to know ""how to seed""...Just leave your program running that you use to DL torrents after you are done DLing. Make sure you are allowing the file to be ""uploading"" and people will be able to get it..uploading=seeding, as far as I know. Just do not remove the file from your torrent list, and you should be seeding by default values."
,heliogab,2011-04-11T06:22Z,Thanks.
