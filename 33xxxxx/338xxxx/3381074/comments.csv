,Q-Bah,2007-07-05T18:12Z,shiggy whats the password =)
,jewishpope,2008-04-29T23:50Z,srsy wats the password
,aftli,2008-05-10T06:21Z,"The password is:

double-u double-u double-u dot torrent dot to

Replace ""double-u"" with ""w"", and ""dot"" with a period, remove all spaces.  Unfortunately TPB won't let you post that URL in comments apparently, so that's why it's obfuscated.

I don't know why jokers always post the wrong password. I promise that worked for me. Only thing I ask is that a few people below me point out that the password worked so this torrent gets some more seeds."
,celigts,2008-06-18T22:01Z,"aftli is right, I downloaded and used the password he posted.  Also the password is on the actual file, but hard to distinguish that it is indeed the pw.

pw: double-u double-u double-u dot torrent dot to

Replace ""double-u"" with ""w"", and ""dot"" with a period, remove all spaces"
,darthdelmar,2010-03-19T18:16Z,"Why the hell is  there a password needed?  This is just fucking stupid. And no, ""www.torrent.com"" or ""www.torrent."" or any damn ""www"" or "".""  is the fucking password."
