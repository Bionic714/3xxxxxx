,Mirbacher88,2007-01-11T23:11Z,"I've watched all the episodes. I laugh so hard I almost cry on every show. The best episodes is episode 7 (the 40 min special with the gumball race) and episode 9 (because of the ""poo diper"")
(both from season 3).

I know the name ""The poo diper"" sound a bit childish, but it's not funny because it's about poo, it's funny because... well check for yourselfs.

Enjoy"

,miffo_i_skogen,2012-01-31T00:55Z,"Hey, know it's a really old torrent. But asking anyway. If you still have the seasons, could you seed some? I'll also keep seeding after for a while too. 

  Can't find these anywhere else. :("
