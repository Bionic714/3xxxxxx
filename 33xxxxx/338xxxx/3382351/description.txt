Plot Outline: Two years ago, a young woman named Valerie was burned after entering a tanning salon. Now, her twin sister, Rhonda runs a local gym where all of a sudden, people are being murdered.

If you like your horror movies cheesy, this is WISCONSIN!! Too horrible to pass up! Gratuitous T&A (and spandex!!), atrociously laughable murder scenes and a massive collection of "never heard from again" actors and actresses make this a true collector's item for anyone who pines for the campy horror invasion from the 1980s!

Enjoy!
