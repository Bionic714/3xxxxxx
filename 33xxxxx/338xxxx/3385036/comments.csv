Is there anything I can do? btw, does anyone have the last three releases or so from Heroquest?  I have all the rest.  I would even scan something and upload it if someone needs it badly."
,onthe1,2008-04-03T03:35Z,"By the last three releases I mean things such as that sourcebook on Dragon Pass, the last two books in the three volume series of adventures(the names slip my mind), and anything else from the past three years or so.  I have a huge collection of everything before three years ago in hardcopy, and like I said if anyone needs anything badly I'll even scan something and upload it. I've got all the old RQ2 stuff in hardcopy too.  I only have a couple issues of The Wyrm's Footnotes but the last one with the Dragonnewts article is great. We Gloranthan addicts should definitely get together and trade some of this stuff.  I'd buy it all if I just had a little more money..."
