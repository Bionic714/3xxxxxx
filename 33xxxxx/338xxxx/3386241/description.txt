For those that dont seem to understand how to make a Request.

1. Request must be made via PM (We Only follow the .torrents for a couple days
    afterwards they wont be read)

2. Know exactly what you want !!! (Which company makes it, and which add-on/s)

3. your 1st request must be in the Subject (this helps us by not having to 
	open/read messages multiple times)

	Please use this format: ex. REQ Lago - Georender 6

4. If you have multiple request include those others in the main body of the 
	message.

5. Have patiance !!!! I may not have it ATM but ill keep my eyes open for them.

All request not in the format above will be ignored and erased. Just imagine your 
getting 20 PM´s aday with Requests, or can you help me ect. This is so we can 
quikly reconize your Req. even after being in our box´s a few days.


Thx,
