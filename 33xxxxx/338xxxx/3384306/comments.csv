,goneja,2006-02-02T16:08Z,eh. lame. thought this would be playable on my dvd-player off my computer. waste of 4gb download.
,altimit,2006-04-18T22:12Z,"By the way, the DVD-ROM homepage is http://thewired.zefie.com/ in case you want to look at screenshots, or want a full file list."
,tachylatus,2006-04-19T01:20Z,"Thanks a lot! :)
List looks great.  I'm especially interrested in the Playstation game.
Is it the full version? (originally 2 discs)

I wonder how you squeezed all that data into such little space."
,altimit,2006-04-27T02:29Z,Yes it is the full version of the PSX game. Thanks for the links. Already have the first two listed on 'The Wired' links page. Server is going to attempt to download and seed now :)
,altimit,2006-04-27T03:09Z,goneja please do not low-rate and bash my torrent just because of your inability to read descriptions. Thanks.
,Blue_Wabbit,2006-04-30T18:51Z,"Yeah really nice, allthough it would have been nicer if  i really could burn the complation to an dvd. Both Nero and Alcohol gave me the same answer, it's too big to burn. Like Nero said, ""Diskspace avaible 4 582mb, compilation size 4 586mb..."" Well shit happens."
,serenitydeath,2006-05-27T09:45Z,Can someone please re-seed the DVD?
,serenitydeath,2006-05-30T16:52Z,thanks you for re-seeding. seeding here and there and as much as I can over the next few days.
,altimit,2006-06-03T09:51Z,"@Blue_Wabbit

I never had that problem, I have it burnt on multiple discs as backup. I use Memorex Single layer media. You might be able to get away with overburning though."
,Taobeth,2006-07-21T20:42Z,Could someone please seed again? I've wanted most of this stuff for years now. 
,wangly,2006-07-31T12:42Z,88.2% - please seed.
,Upaut,2006-08-23T05:03Z,"Gawd, not much for seeding.  Feels like someone's using dialup to seed this."
,altimit,2006-08-26T10:45Z,I'll start seeding again on 9/1 hopefully. Waiting for my ISP to fix some problems. :/ Thanks for your patience and interest.
,missingxtension,2006-09-29T20:47Z,guys ill keep on seeding for about four more days i know im the only one for a couple of days now but im sorry i need to make space for my unix/linux distros
,missingxtension,2006-10-01T01:29Z,"i really witch it would let me upload at full speed
but it only lets me seed at 30k for some reason"
,Usaki Li,2006-10-04T10:18Z,"Come on people, need more seeders. For such a great torrent how are there so little people seeding??"
,altimit,2006-12-10T23:35Z,"I'll seed again. But considering I still have a small pipe and also using my connection for other things, the best I can give is 5kb/s. Sorry :("
,analu,2006-12-18T13:30Z,"damn. can't download this ;/ don't know what the problem is. the torrent gets red in azureus and it says: ""not enough space in disc..."" plenty of space in disc, though!!! i'm new to pirate bay, so i don't know if this sort of thing usualy hapens or not... help :( what can i do? anyone..."
,Ran4,2006-12-23T14:32Z,analu - You probably use FAT32 as a file operating system. Convert it to NTFS. Google it!
,mopar68,2007-01-16T14:33Z,"Wow, thanks! i've been looking for the game & bootleg a long time! The apps & cels are nice too!"
,mopar68,2007-01-17T21:10Z,0 seeds? come on now....seed!

,Wooohoo,2008-09-02T12:13Z,"Oh man Please please SEED!
I want this."
,Shadokai,2009-01-10T03:00Z,what dose this run with ????
,racxie,2009-03-17T02:03Z,"Avast found a Trojan in: The Ultimate Serial Experiments DVD-ROM\Extras\DVD Development\Macintosh Voices\selaindvd_scripts (Mac Disk Image)\selaindvd_scripts.dsk

I then extracted the .mdf file and found the file in question, scanned it again to make sure and it comes up again. 

Anyone else had this or anything like this? I'm guessing being in the extras folder it's not important so hopefully I'll be able to re-package the files without it.

Thanks either way for this though."
,zerozefie,2009-05-30T15:53Z,"Hiya, this is altimit (my login isn't working for some reason). At any rate, in regards to the trojan, I am sure this is just a false-positive, but if it bothers you, you can just delete that file. All it is, is a Disk Image for the Basilisk II Macintosh Emulator, which is formatted in HFS (MacOS) format and has some text files (Mac's text editor that had the speech function, I can't remember the name)

That's all it is, it is not important to the operation of the DVD and was just included for vanity. It is harmless, but as I said, you can delete it without any repercussions. I would not delete the entire Extras directory though as some of the interface depends on the folder."
,SacredGrove,2009-08-30T08:46Z,"Wow i won't think this anime was even around in english anymore, and here i find a complete set. Thanks altimit i hope who even has this complete would keep seeding it because this is a one time offer i cant pass up. Please for the love of God SEEED so that when I'm done ill see this one too. Sharing is Caring"
,zerozefie,2009-12-14T23:59Z,Seeding again ;)
