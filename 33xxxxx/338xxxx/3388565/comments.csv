,Germ0683,2008-07-02T04:25Z,Im at a loss here... I've downloaded and installed the game just fine. When I try to run the program it continually repeats that I need to insert the appropriate disk. The thing that confuses me is that I have the appropriate disk loaded using daemon tools and it did install. Anyone know what I should do?
,tolis15,2008-07-27T11:43Z,"I have a problem, too whit the crack.I can't understand what i must do to find it plz someone help meeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,moth111,2008-09-12T21:12Z,"w/r/t the crack: (This is at least relevant for Vista,) After you install the game, mount the disc 1 iso (I used Daemon Tools,) and when the option to autorun or open the files individually using Explorer pops up, open the files with Explorer. The Deviance foldr is in there. Copy it into C:/PROGRAM?X_MEN2/ or whereever the hell you installed the game. To run the game I had to  run the  xmen.exe that was with the deviance crack, NOT the .exe that installed with the iso (That just kept telling me to insert the proper cd.) And if that didn't make any sense, I'm apoligize. Try clicking on random things until it works.
Dope upload. Thanks. "
,cadtech,2008-10-04T23:56Z,"This is a crap-load... Can't even start it...
I'm not a noob, so it's not the noobish mistakes...

I have installed it using the appropriate mounting procedure, I've cracked the game with the supplied crack and when I try to load it, right at the loading screen, some error occur, but you can't see the msg, since alt+tab don't work...

I saw that others have the same problem, and noone of the previous commenters have succeeded in getting the game running, so I suggest that those of you who are thinking of D/L-ing this should look for another torrent!"
,nubispwnu,2009-04-07T02:06Z,"im stuck also, i know how to mount and stuff, but do i have to torrent both the .cue and the .bin or i just choose one group, because i mounted the first CD with the .cue and it gave me this black window that opened for about to seconds and then closed, then when i explore the CD and run the installer it says it's not a verified windows installer"
,ahmedaliomar,2009-06-07T20:47Z,"works great 
no problem at all"
,ust2,2009-09-11T23:12Z," Unsure what is up with this copy, seems to be bs. 

 The cd's are non-existant with daemon, and the install.txt says to unrar the .bin's(wtf u dont unrar cd images) and when you try there are a bunch of weird folders with odd alt-code characters.."
,ust2,2009-09-11T23:18Z," Ah my bad, it's all good. +1 for my stupidity!

 I skipped dling the .cue which you don't normally need, but that seems to be the case this time."
,siloin869,2009-12-06T12:03Z,"beggars cant be choosers, and i love the game, but i was hoping someone might have the rest of the series out there: legends 1, mua 1 & 2.  of course for pc, because i havent been able to get my pcsx2 running yet.  any direction helps.  cheers."
,radd666,2009-12-30T11:57Z,wow nice seedin guys! dl at cca 195kbps! cant wait to play! 
,SkullAndBones420,2010-10-24T01:57Z,"i attempted to mount this but it seems I can only do one disc at a time.  So when the install says to insert disc two the whole process is fucked.  Did any individual successfully mount this instead of burning it onto discs.  If so, how.  "
,TomSawyer410,2010-11-14T04:38Z,"ok people it is not that hard. this game works fine. download the torrent. there will be three folders (disk 1-3) mount the .bin files using whatever (i use powerISO) run the setup file and begin the install, when it asks you to change disks, go back out and change the mounted disk to disk two, then three, then back to one. when its done it will tell you to input the proper disk. to fix this open the file location (probobly activision/x-men2...) then go back to the mounted disk one and look at its files. there will be a file called deviant. open that and copy all three of its files. go back to the x-men file location and paste those files. it will ask you if you want to replace the existing one. click yes and then the game will play. you may have to run the deviant file first, if you have any problems try that. this really is simple, i am a noob at this stuff and i had no problem at all.

,olly1990,2011-06-15T13:04Z,This installation package could not be opened. Contact the application vendor to verify that this is a valid Windows Installer package. F**k.
,Bordagolz,2012-01-28T05:49Z,Works Perfectly Thanks :)
,matt556,2012-09-08T05:46Z,"I find it utterly amazing that ppl cant work these games. Seriously, what are you doing on a torrent site if you cant install a goddamn game? Whenever an install poses a problem i stop, use my head, figure it out and bam! it works! amazing!

Seeding's fine. 
No viruses.
Great torrent.
If you cant work it, you're an idiot and don't need to be on this site.
Thanks OP."
