,medgix,2008-08-04T12:56Z,"""BTW Are these dvd rips?""
No, they're subs. Subbers aint seeding anymore so I am.
Thanks to all the seeders out there!
Specialy gurkgnuggtuggare"
,Thalinor,2008-12-06T17:35Z,"Subbers are not seeding anymore because subs fucking suck.  The ""old way"" of thinking is over.  It doesn't make you ""cool"" to watch anime in subs.

Torrent missing episodes as well.

Thank you for your time but it does a lot of people no good.  Plenty of other rips that are have both audio (jap and eng) with subs as an option. 

The only good thing is these are avi and thus work with most Dvd players.  The mkv's usually have bullshit vorbis audio which will not convert to avi.  What we need is some fucking avi's in the english language."
,MrSheep,2010-03-21T09:09Z,"Please, can we revive this? If not for a week or two? I'll happily seed to a ratio of 2-3. "
