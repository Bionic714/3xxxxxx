,niro3000,2007-11-25T00:35Z,pauses every 5-10 seconds....unwatchable...
,niro3000,2007-11-25T00:40Z,i just realized that it wasn't downloaded complete yet....my bad...
,NikopolX,2007-12-14T08:52Z,I'd need a seed for the final 40 Mb of the file (and it seems I'm not alone on this)
,niro3000,2007-12-17T03:21Z,"looks like I have been seeding for the past month!  but I have been sitting on 83.9% for the past few weeks!

Seed please Riot999!
I can seed when I finally get the whole thing."
,bignowhere,2007-12-22T11:02Z,"Hey Riot999,

Unfortunately, I'm not having a riot right now as I'm stuck at 96.9% on this torrent. Everybody else is at 96.8%.

Guess I'm the big knob at the moment.  Could you please re-seed so we can keep this thing going?  Saint Roy Batty will bless you if this could be made so."
,bignowhere,2007-12-23T06:06Z,"Thank You Brother.

Keep the spirit of sharing alive."
,t3h,2008-07-04T22:39Z,"Stuck at 99.8%, with two other downloaders (usa, spain). I would greatly appreciate it if you could seed the missing kilobytes.

Thanks for sharing this."
