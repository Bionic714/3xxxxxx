A gorgeous, 5-minute trailer for the upcoming Hellsing OVA has been released, encoded in gorgeous Matroska by the illustrious VeryFluffy. It can be found at MiniNova. 

I have borrowed this file, re-encoded it into DivX, and added Schaft's 'Broken English', the soundtrack used when the trailer was shown at various anime conventions. I'm pretty proud of the result. The video is nowhere near as glossy as the original Matroska file, but it runs on everything I've thrown it at. 

Video size: 640 x 464
Aspect ratio: 1.38:1
Audio Codec: ffdshow Audio Decoder
Video Codec: ffdshow MPEG-4 Video Decoder

If I can trust my software, this result should be compatible with DivX Home Theater. 

Much thanks to VeryFluffy for providing me with the raw material to create this; I could not have done it without your dedicated work. Hopefuly you will not see what I've done to your work and decide to hunt me down like the scurvy dog I am. :)

Oh, and Ha-Chan...? Bite me. :D
