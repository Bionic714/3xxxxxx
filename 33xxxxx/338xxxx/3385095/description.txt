Description: Benigno is a male nurse who secretly watches Alicia, a dance student taking lessons at a dance studio near Benigno's home. When an accident leaves Alicia comatose she is admitted in the hospital where Benigno works and the girl of his dreams falls under his care. Marco is a journalist whose lover Lydia, a female bull-fighter, has also fallen in a coma. The two men meet and get to be friends despite their contrasting characters; Marco is steadfast yet sensitive and Benigno's apparently soft character hides a darker side. In my opinion this is Almodovar's best film to date.
