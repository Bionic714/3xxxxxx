I made the subs. I have not mkved them because they need some improvement - not the timing, but 4 or 5 times I didn't get what was said, english no mother tongue... So if (when) you correct them, please share them or post an answer with the timecode and the true transcription...

"HANNIBAL, special hannibalized edition unauthorized. For all those who enjoyed Hannibal much less than they hoped to, here is a very special edition for you to put things finally at the right place.No, he is not a good man.No, he does not kill only bad and rude people.Yes, there was way to much about Starling in this movie.Yes, Barny sucks and a friendship between him and Hannibal is just not possible.Yes, Thomas Harris got corrupted by movie companies and we are not willing to accept this.;-)"
