This is a re-seed of the CD4 Desert Rats program from the BBC Gladiators of WW2 series. I found the torrent file on a different tracker even though the torrent tracker announcer said it was from Pirtate Bay, I could not find a copy of the torrent here. 

I will seed this one. We need others to finish seeding the other parts 1-13. Many of us are stuck on CDs 8 thru 13. 

We need seeds for the following torrents:

BBC_gladiators_of_ww2_cd_8__Free_French_Forces
BBC_gladiators_of_ww2_cd_9__The_Royal_Navy
BBC_gladiators_of_ww2_cd_10_The_Anzacs
BBC_gladiators_of_ww2_cd_11__Free_Polish_Forces
BBC_gladiators_of_ww2_cd_12_The_Chindits
BBC_gladiators_of_ww2_cd_13__Paras_and_Commandos

Many of us are stuck at between 85% and 99.7% on most of these and 26.2% on #8.

There are quite a few of us that would appreciate a hand from those with full copies of any of the above.
