I was watching Pi the other day and came across this music video in the extra features. Great soundtrack to Pi and this really does do justice to both the soundtrack and visual style.

Short clip, but great quality.

It was ripped with DVDShrink, converted with DVD2AVI, and finally the AC3 track was combined with the video using VirtualDubMod.
