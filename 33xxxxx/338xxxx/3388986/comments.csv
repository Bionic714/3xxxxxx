Ive managed to download and install this program. Im having trouble registering it though. The request i copy as stated does not accept and comes up with an error. Does anyone have any suggestions? Will the package still run, or only for a limited time?

Thanks, Tina"

,niallers,2007-02-13T15:28Z,"I downloaded ok and started installing, all seemed to be going well until i was asked to verify that i had access to some files, and since i couldnt i cant finish installation. Could whoever posted this be able to fix this issue or provide guidelines to get around this problem? Thanks"
,niallers,2007-02-13T15:45Z,"during installation several messages appear, there are a lot of .dll, .shx and .cab files missing which you cannot install without!!"
,niallers,2007-03-03T19:00Z,I got it installed and working. during installation when it tells you that a file is missing use windows explorer to copy and paste the file to the right location. All the files that it thinks are missing are located in the Disc 2.I have ADT running now a lot of the tool palettes still wont work but you can still create your own tools.I still cant get the Help to work as i cant seem to figure out where to put the relevant files. I cant complain though as this programme costs 4500 Euros where I live.
,niallers,2007-03-03T19:05Z,"I got this up and running,the files it thinks are missing during installation are located in the 2nd disc.whenever a popup ass you to verify that you have access to the file go to disc 2 and copy/paste the file to the relevant location. Not all the tool palettes work but you can still create all your own tools/materials etc.I cant get the help function to work as i dont know what location to put the files into. Cant complain though as this programme costs 4500 Euros where I live."

,makitadude,2011-08-07T22:09Z,"This downloaded and burned to disk very nicely.  As far as I can tell, you can only use the software for 30 days cuz it is a trial.  If you know someone with the same version however, like I do, you can use their s/n to register the software.  I used my brother's s/n and the registration went thru just fine under my own name."
