,atsfan,2006-01-04T04:16Z,There are alot of WIN Xp SP2 for dl. and i picked this one. and i noticed that there aren't any comments. and i wanted to ask before i install this onto my computer. Is this interlaced with viruses or spyware? and do i can burn the ISO to a cd and run it? or use ISO to exact the files then burn it? answers to these questions would be great
,diargasm,2006-01-04T07:28Z,"I just installed Pro Corp, and it works great.  No hiccup."
,diargasm,2006-01-04T08:11Z,"Actually, I take that back. The drives are running slow. USB drives, cd, and flash drives."
,millefeuille,2006-01-05T23:34Z,"Darn it, for those downloading this file be wary the author has left a few items out of the install, namely support for East Asian Languages.  All the directories /i386/lang are empty, so if you're like me and NEED the language support you're screwed.  Speaking of which anyone if any of the other ISOs specifically have the files or if the author would be just freaking awesome and put up a torrent for them?"
,choking victim,2006-01-07T23:42Z,i've tried installing the home but after so far in the install i get a fatal error SXS.DLL missing and needed to install...:s i thought it might be a bad burn so i tried it again from another disc but i got the same thing...can someone help me or tell me where i can find a working xp????thx

,JuanJ,2007-06-13T17:49Z,"@xXnervesXx, Yes, When You Boot From CD, It Asks You If You Want To Format Your Drive So That You can Install Tis."
,andreyvul,2007-06-14T03:27Z,"@xXnervesXx: personally, I would just dd binary values to my hd (using a Linux live cd, such as Knoppix)

One-pass zeroization: ""dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/xdy bs=ZZM count=WW""
x is h is pata, s if sata/scsi
y is device letter (a for first device on s/ata/scsi, b for second...z for 26th).
for blocksize, ZZ is your drive's speed.
Use the transfer rate from ""hdparm -t --direct /dev/xdy"" and round down the output a bit (i.e., my laptop's hd is 27.5MB/sec; I round down to 24)
A good idea is to enable 32-bit IO, dma, irq unmask, and write caching: ""hdparm -c3d1u1W1 /dev/xdy""
WW (count) = (drive size in GB * 1000) / (transfer rate in MB/s) 

Once you use an actual (read geek-oriented) linux system (i.e., one that is fully functional without a GUI, e.g., Gentoo), this is trivial.
UBUNTU DOES NOT COUNT AS A REAL LINUX SYSTEM for two reasons: 1) gnu toolchain is not automatically installed, and build-essential does not have m4 or awk; and 2) YOU CAN'T EASILY RECOMPILE THE KERNEL"

I won't if those large company who files and send letters to the piratebay behind the files corruption, because this is not the first time, I may have download dozens of files and most of them in compress files are corrupted."

Does this disk actually boot on the newer comps.? I have a emachine 633, and no XP disks boot, neither does this one. 
 I have to winnt them thru dos. Is there a way to access it thru does, if I have too? 
I went to Install XP PRO> Create ISO > Create CORP ISO, such that about 97% on the two I tried corp and pro retain, I get some error about the image and some boot statement. it happens so fast it's hard to read, and it closes down. The first time, I tried to create an ISO, my computer rebooted, and I lost drive sequence, as in the bios settings reversing my d1 (80g) and D2 (15g), to exact oposite. So I had to change that back. When I try to install of the same disk, not creating an iso, it changes by partitions. 
RANISH partman240 says : 

2  XP (system )  note: BOOT.
1   p2 MUSIC
3   p3 Music
4   p3 ARhives   

During the 1st reboot, after file copy, it says no system.  I run fdisk and Part244.exe, and it says
2  XP (system )  note: BOOT.
1   p2 MUSIC
3   p3 Music
4   p3 ARhives   

When I left 2, 3 and 4 blank, as it says you can, I lost all my partions as to see what windows would do, and Had to use DISKTEST to recover my partions..  
No matter what numbers I put for the rows using Ranish, diskpart, always displays them in the same order..  If I had a disk Editor, like in the past, I could examine the disk and correct this problem, but XP is touchy if  you change row numbers in RPM, and says, Cant find Hall.dll. 
It's not the file is missing, its Xp, screwing up the partion and not leaving it alone.  
Perhaps I will write to the Author of RPM, and explain this, But being that have analyzed these changes before thru playing around, I can fix the problem quickly... and reboot, ok..  
Does anyone know of a partition manager that works more compatible with XP.. 
It is to my know also, as told by a collegue technician, who owns XP corp, that he says, XP CORP doesn't need activation, and passes thru updates without hassels.. Can anyone comment of having a similar experience? That is why I got this file, only because of what I heard about Corp Installs... "
