,Kemono,2008-10-28T03:49Z,"I'm not able to find the original theatrical version on the ISO, was it removed?"
,KiWiSouP,2009-12-16T02:26Z,"As it says in the description, it's only the main movie with everything else removed except some audio tracks. The ""original"" version without the new song ""Morning Report"" is not here, which kinda sucks because it was a tiny clip that seamlessly branched. Also, it's the IMAX remastered version with a lot of parts redrawn and recolored so it looks visibly different to me than the original."
