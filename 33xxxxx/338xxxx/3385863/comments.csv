,xdeath82,2008-10-22T23:30Z,"Total waste of time, this is pure garbage (no pun intended).

All images are scanned at lossy compressed JPG and are only 190x260 ann then zipped!? WTF? Obviously this person doesn't know what they're doing!

The right way to do this is use lossless .TIF at min. 1000x1000 and then compress it down into a small zip!

You could have had a 66mb zip w/ high quality TIFFs - too bad this person is stupid! WASTE OF DOWNLOAD!"
