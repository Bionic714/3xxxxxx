Star Control 3 is the sequel to SC2, otherwise known as The Ur-Quan Masters. It was released in 1995 by Legend and Accolade. It's a very hard game to come by these days in this, its full voice-acted version.

If you're on an NT based OS (Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, etc.), you will need a DOS emulator like DOSbox and probably a frontend for it like D-Fend.

Enjoy!
