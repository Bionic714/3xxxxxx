Gustav Mahler: Symphony no.8 \\\"Symphony of a Thousand\\\" - Wiener Philarmoniker/Leonard Bernstein. Directed for Unitel by Humphrey Burton. Recorded at Konzerthaus, Vienna, 8 & 9/1975. This is the famous film of M8 for Unitel that has been released by Deutsche Grammophon in 2005 as DVD. The present audio-visual record is not the same performance currently available as part of Bernstein\\\'s second audio-only Mahler cycle for DG. The film\\\'s performance is,however,superior in terms of insight and control.
