Go back to Kazaa if you want smaller stuff :P"
,abbe123,2006-12-13T18:07Z,#ichithechiller: ATM 87 seeders and 40 leechers. 10mb extra for each. You do the math if you can.
,ichithechiller,2006-12-14T16:36Z,"@ abbe13: I'll do the math. I have uploaded 125+ torrents, you 0. Thanks for all your great contributions.

If you're really losing sleep over the 10 Mb extra here's what you can do: download torrent, remove thumnails etc. and upload it again yourself. Problem solved and you've done a great thing for humanity.

Merry (Kazaa) Christmas :P"
