,elmoncho,2006-12-05T20:06Z,"Thanks a lot Hajime. 
A quick question: Are the english subs for the hearing impaired (deaf people)?"
,Hajime,2006-12-06T20:23Z,"Normal english subs, not for impired people.

I have Dead and the Maiden. Is Spanish Edition with English audio but only spanish subs. Good pictures quality, but interlaced."
,elmoncho,2006-12-06T20:27Z,"Thank you Hajime, great release!"
