,boswa,2006-12-10T13:44Z,give people a chance to download this shit before you pull the plug.
,hentooth,2006-12-11T00:10Z,"I am seeding again, but the number of leechers who have thier upload turned off in thier torrent software PISSED me off.

I appreciate the fact I can download films and music so fast, so I wanted to give a little back, and was annoyed..... Also after a few beers, which didn't help!!

Seeding is under way, even on a deicated PC to do such, so it don't slow me down doing paid work any more."
[V],bellis,2006-12-12T22:34Z,"Hi Hentooth.

,hentooth,2006-12-13T08:41Z,"Bellis, every chance of scanned covers, and the book from the inside and the cd fronts as well, I'll do that tonight after work"

Bellis, what you said ddn't translate too well, what did you ask?"
[V],bellis,2006-12-13T22:07Z,"hehe.

I just said, 

Thanks a million ;o)

Now we only lack (need) the rest of this radio drama  ;o) "
,hentooth,2006-12-13T22:13Z,"Bellis,

Download the douglas addams everything he ever did from the top 100 audio books, I did that a week or so ago, and it is pretty much everything"
[V],bellis,2006-12-13T22:17Z,"Thanks for that as well but Ive already got them since before. I was just hoping that you might seed the rest of the serie as quality iso rips.. ;o)

Something that one should burn and print covers to ...   ;o)  "
,hentooth,2006-12-13T22:30Z,"Not got any more to ISO ... YET... Me and my brother did record them off the radio years ago as they aired, so I'll see if he'll lend them to me, and I'll convert them"
