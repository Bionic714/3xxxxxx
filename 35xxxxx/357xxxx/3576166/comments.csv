BTW, episode is ABSOLUTELY GREAT. I loved it. One of the best episodes of ALL STARGATE (SG1 and Atlantis) ever."
,obiwanbill,2006-12-16T03:52Z,"Hey Guys, This is in x264. You need to update your codecs (klcodec280f.exe is the latest one), or at least I had too over here ...

Or you can look for the torrent.

During install, it will ask you to uninstall other codecs, you may have. It's OK, do it. It seems to have worked on my two systems.

BTW, to play this file my little HTPC with an AMD 2500+ and 1GB of RAM is way too slow. I think you need A64 or better to play it.

Just a heads up.

Man. You should better speed up your computer by removing viruses, spyware, troians and other shit, as this releases PLAY SMOOTHLY on a Pentium III 800 Mhz machine (tested it myself). 

So YES, this is something wrong with your computer. X264 codec is relatively very fast."

Nope. This is 3x16 Tao Of Rodney.
They just changed the order in the middle of season. I'm following the OLD order."
