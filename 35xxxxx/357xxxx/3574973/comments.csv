,Argatur,2008-10-01T18:08Z,"@Bukalo
Use WinRar to unpack it, right click on the file, if u use bittorent click open containing folder. Then select all and right click and select Pack Up Here and choose where to unpack it.
Same to you Maisterkill."
,knagzhar666,2010-02-21T09:47Z,"In order to play this game you will need Daemon tools Lite, the version depends on the Iso file.
And most of the times you don't even have to um-rar the file.
So now im going to type some retard information.
1. Start daemon tools
2. Right click on the tray icon and press mount image.
3. Then search your downloaded files folder for the iso file and press it.
And after these 3 simple steps you'll be able to play the game without the DVD"
