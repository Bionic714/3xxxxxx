Full Sierra Kings Quest Collection 1-6 with manuals included. Please get DosBox (http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/) to run these games! I would also recommend using D-Fend, which works extremely well with DosBox and makes running the games much much easier (http://members.home.nl/mabus/dfend.htm)

Please SEED! These games are rare!
