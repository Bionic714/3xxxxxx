,pilatuspilot,2006-12-08T13:10Z,"Can anyone tell me if this can be installed along with Flight1's IWI 1-4?
I have that, if anyone can tutor me (using PM) how to make a torrent and upload it here."
,scooby321999,2006-12-08T13:31Z,"pilatuspilot: It is possible I have done it.. however since F1's IWI scenery has custom island textures and meshes you will end up having to manually disabling most of Fly-to-Caribe airports leaving only the Southern, South-West, and North-West Airports that are part of Fly to Caribe.. to be honest while Fly to Caribe does not come with custom island scenery, the airports are much better and so is the included mesh.. as long as you have a decent landclass (i.e. GE or GE Pro) it looks much better...

To sum it up.. IWI overwrites most airports making the better FlytoCaribe ones useless.. so dont bother with IWI and use just Fly to Caribe.."
,scooby321999,2006-12-08T13:32Z,"Also, dont worry about uploading IWI here since it can be directly downloaded from F1 and Wildman's de-wrapper can be used... saves everyones bandwidth that way... but thanks for the offer!"
,pilatuspilot,2006-12-08T13:39Z,"Scooby, thank you for your brilliant answer to my question. Most appreciated.
And thank you for saving me bandwidth power were I to upload IWI1-4.
Fortunately, for the developers, I purchased IWI as it went through its last 2 phrases. Money not well-spent, in my opinion, but at least it might have given some incentive to the main developer to do continue his craft."

,caplav,2008-04-22T06:08Z,Could anybody seed it?
,UberScary,2008-08-17T17:44Z,How do you install this?
,dippie21,2009-02-08T21:04Z,"When i installing it, it says in the middle of the install please insert disc 1 or install it in atoher location..
please help me"
,Rlymdlr,2010-03-20T02:45Z,"Great listing -- lots of airports. Trouble is, aboit 1/3 are messed up somehow, and you need the correct serial to get the patches from Tropicalsim's website. Anyone have a Tropicalsim keygen or big serial list?"
