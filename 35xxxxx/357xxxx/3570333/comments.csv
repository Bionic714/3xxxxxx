But what program do I need to burn or just listen to the tracks?
Never seen this format before."
,patrick9,2006-12-07T18:56Z,"use winamp to play the files, but you'll need the wavpack plugin for winamp before they will play, it's the wavpack nullsoft plugin to be exact"
,patrick9,2006-12-07T18:57Z,the wavpack plugin for winamp can be found @ www.wavpack.com

It was from my own collection, ripped at 192 from the original disk.  I suggest you take a moment when you get mad and take a deep breath next time.

I'm glad you, like myself, are looking to share Old Skoool classics.  Please visit my torrents for Old Skoool Flava.
