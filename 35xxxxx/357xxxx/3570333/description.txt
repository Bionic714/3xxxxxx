Alright after not sharing for awhile due to upload and shitty internet service providers, such as Insightbb cable internet, i'm back with so more old skool music. This release as always is recorded with Easy cd-da Extractor, only thing that has changed is i decided to go with my old favorite encoder, wav-pack. I feel overall it's best for all types of music. This was encoded from original disc, NOT a re-copy from previous download files. I guess i'm a bit of an ass when it comes to audio quality. I hope you all enjoy this disc. Comments are welcomed and wanted, good or bad. Thanks and i hope you enjoy this old release.
