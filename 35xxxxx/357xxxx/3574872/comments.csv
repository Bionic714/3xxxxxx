,woktoss,2011-04-17T04:27Z,"my wife died a few years back... and my mom is currently dying of cancer... this book has helped me accept these harsh challenges of life with a peaceful mindset, without the incessant thoughts of worries and fears that plague our minds since childhood... whenever i walk out the hospital in the open air, i now feel great peace and sense of unity with everything around me. 

this book is truly life changing... highly recommended to anyone seeking truth and happiness.

thank you upoader djehuti."
