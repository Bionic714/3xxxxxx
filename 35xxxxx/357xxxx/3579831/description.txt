Barton Lee Hazlewood (born July 9, 1929 in Mannford, Oklahoma) is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer.

The son of an oilman, Hazlewood spent most of youth living between Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, and Louisiana. Hazlewood spent his teenage years in Port Neches, TX where he was exposed to a rich Gulf Coast music tradition. Hazlewood studied for a medical degree at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. He served with the United States Army during the Korean War.

Hazlewood is perhaps most famous for writing the Nancy Sinatra hit, "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'." But Hazlewood's own output has also achieved a cult status in the underground rock scene, with songs covered by artists such as Lydia Lunch, Einsturzende Neubauten, Nick Cave and Boyd Rice.

Hazlewood has a distinctive baritone voice that adds an ominous resonance to his music. Hazlewood's collaborations with Nancy Sinatra as well as his solo output in the late 1960s and early 1970s have been praised as an essential contribution to a sound often described as 'Cowboy Psychedelia' or 'Saccharine Underground'. In 2006 Lee sung for Bela B's first solo album "Bingo" the song "Lee Hazlewood und das erste Lied des Tages" ("Lee Hazlewood and the first song of the day").
