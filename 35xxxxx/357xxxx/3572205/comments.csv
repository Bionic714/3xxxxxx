A lot of the other Red Dwarf torrents are really bloated and I must admit I do have space issues on my hard disk so this was perfect, I already have the second season downloaded and it looks great but this one is stuck on 88% only 120 MB left so could somebody please seed!
I will make sure I will do my part by seeding these myself out of appreciation!

So, thank you and please seed"
