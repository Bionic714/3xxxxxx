,Zwamp,2006-12-07T17:10Z,Why cant all your share be rar :/
[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-07T17:41Z,"Zwamp (if i undertstand your ""question"" correctly): I got two sources for torrents. One were they're in rar and one were they aren't. I try to get them all from the ""Rared n' untouched"" source but sometimes I can't, and then i upload the unrared content, because that's better than nothing at all."
,k@js@,2006-12-07T19:08Z,Seed it !!! :)
[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-07T20:15Z,It's being very well seeded
,shAzbot,2006-12-08T00:31Z,"I don't get it. The only reason for .rar is maybe if you're on a rar hub on DC++.. but then can't you rar it yourself?

I have to sit here and watch all those comments aboute people who is angry because it's NOT in .rar.. and I'm getting freaked out.

Everytime i download a .rar with torrents there's at least one of the .r00 damaged, and i have to try to repair it (which works 1/10) and otherwise i have to redownload it aboute 10 times untill it finally is not corrupt. THEN another file gets corrupt and smashin my keyboard with a baseball bat.

I'd rather drink terpentine and pee on open fire then try to extract another corrupted .rar archive."
[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-08T03:48Z,"shAzbot: you should try using the hash control in your bittorrent client if something is corrupt. then you don't have to re-download more than some bytes.
And for Rar hubs, it's important that you have the same rars as everyone else who is having the release, so you can't compress yourself."
