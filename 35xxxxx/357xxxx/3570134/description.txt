This is the same DVD (disc one) as in: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3560748/Macbook_Restore_DVD

The only difference is that this is in bin/cue files. Some people experienced problems with the dmg format, hence this new upload. 

To freshen up your memory, this is:
Macbook Restore DVD (disc 1 of 2) with Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger DUAL LAYER

I hope it will work for all of you this time.
