,substereo,2007-02-22T10:06Z,"It turns out, I think, that the MBP / MB somehow is locked onto the unique ID of the original installerDVD. I thought this wasn't possible, and have tried three different original MBP sets of installers, everyone giving me the same alert as

,drakerccb,2007-03-16T17:48Z,"i downloaded the ""bin/cue"" filee for this from ""the Pirate Bay""  took a while but its a good file.  But I was wandering how to use this file.  I heard that you are supposed to burn it but I dont know what I should burn it to or what program to use for bin/cue files.  I have the programs ""BURN"" and ""firstarter""  but they tell me things like ""not enough space and whatever""  so i need to know what type of disk and what size to burn this on and what program to use doing it.  the image file is a little over 4.7GB and so is my dvd+r is 4.7GB exactly.  What am i doing wrong?"
,homosapiens1,2007-03-18T22:56Z,"Jag har exakt samma problem som ""drakerccb"", nämligen fick en MacBook med ett lösenord till innlogg. och har ingen original skiva. Går det att komma förbi lösenordet om man inte har någon skiva? "

Yes, It will work on the Macbook, that's why its called ""Macbook install disk"". And no,you dont need the second dvd,if you unselect pretty much everything.
on the install,just before it begins installing - the last step, there will be a button that says customise. Click on it. un-select everything it will let you. now click install. No dvd 2 needed."

,WUTANG36CHAMBERS,2008-01-29T01:06Z,"Burned with DL-DVD using NERO 
(worked for me)

I succesfully used this to reset the admin password on a Intel Mac. There is a ""reset password"" option on the install.

Unchecked everything that is optional as per 'Macbook2.0CD!!!' instructions.

Installed fine on an Intel Macbook C2Duo
Also Updated to newest version fine after that.

No disc 2 needed.
