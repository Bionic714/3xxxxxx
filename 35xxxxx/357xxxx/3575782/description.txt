Mark Hunter (Slater), a high school student, starts a pirate radio station which broadcasts from his bedroom in the basement of his parent's house. Mark is a loner, an outsider, whose only outlet for his teenage angst and aggression is his radio station. (His pirate station's theme song is "Everybody Knows" by Leonard Cohen.). By day, Mark is seen as a loner, hardly talking to anyone around him, by night, he expresses his outsider views about what is wrong with American society. When he speaks his mind about what is going on at his school and in the community, more and more of his fellow students tune in to hear his show. Nobody knows the true identity of "Hard Harry" or "Happy Harry Hard On", as Mark refers to himself, until Nora Diniro (Mathis) tracks him down. Eventually, the radio show causes so much trouble in the community that the FCC is called in to investigate.
