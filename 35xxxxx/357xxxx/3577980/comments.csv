,CelestialPenso,2006-12-19T08:12Z,Does this work?Meaning this has a trial future or is  free ;)?
[V],Kalliz,2006-12-19T14:20Z,"To be quite honest, I haven't even tried it myself...

This is from the Adobe Labs website

""The Photoshop CS3 beta is available in English only but to Photoshop CS2 users worldwide. It is available to licensed users of either the Photoshop CS2 (full, upgrade, and education), Adobe Creative Suite 2 Standard or Premium (full, upgrade, and education), Adobe Production Studio Standard and Premium (full, upgrade, and education), Adobe Video Bundle (full, upgrade, and education) or Adobe Web Bundle (full, upgrade, and education). You will need to provide your Photoshop CS2, Creative Suite, Production Studio or Bundle serial number in order to get a Photoshop CS3 beta serial number, enabling you to activate the Photoshop beta and use it beyond the two-day grace period"" 

Hope that clears up a few questions"
,wanzedk,2006-12-24T01:23Z,Why the fuck do you upload crap like this when you can download it from Adobe.com for free?
[V],Kalliz,2006-12-28T05:11Z,"Just to be a nice guy :) 

I hope you ask all the other people who uploaded the same file the same question

But just to make it conspicuous to you:

Downloading from Adobe Labs requires an account - not everyone wants to make an account to download something - *especially* when they don't have to, since they can acquire it at sites like this one. 

Furthermore - alot of seeds might result in pretty sweet down speeds, as opposite to a HTTP-server - not always as good. 

Quit asking dumb questions from now on, you retarded fuck. You could have figured that out, and you know it. If you can download it from Adobe Labs, then why did you bother to annoy me and others with you meaningsless comments?"
[V],Kalliz,2006-12-28T05:12Z,"PS: Photoshop is not ""crap"", as you so eloquently put it."
[V],Kalliz,2007-01-04T22:15Z,"I can find the torrent with out a problem...Just click the ""Download this torrent""-link and choose a download destination. It should work. "
