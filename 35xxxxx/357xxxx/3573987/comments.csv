,thirteenburn,2009-08-26T10:09Z,"The tracker is either wrong, or someone's selling a line of bullshit, because when I first downloaded this torrent, it said the same thing with regards to the amount of seeders and leechers and it wasn't the case then (it took THREE DAYS to download it and I ended up with having to kill the torrent with 98.7% downloaded, making the video, while not impossible, still irritating as Hell to watch, as it stops every five minutes or so and then ""jumps ahead"".

So. I see it now with the same amount and I'm thinking, with the problems with trying to find servers and such, that this is pretty recent and the seeds and leeches should be pretty much right on.

NOT!!!

Do NOT waste your time trying to download this file. The only thing correct is that there are indeed seven leeches, but ZERO seeders, which I would be happy to do if I had the complete show, which I do not.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD. DEAD TORRENT!!"
