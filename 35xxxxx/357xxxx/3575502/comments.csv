,zuzzy,2006-12-12T21:32Z,This is my first torrent on TPB but as I saw this  was out on nforce.nl and no trace of it here for 2 days I had to re-act....enjoy.
,squishsquash,2006-12-13T20:15Z,Isnt this a demo? http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/expression-web/system-requirements.mspx
[V],jnd,2006-12-16T23:14Z,"A serial is included...

Why do you think it's a demo?
And why are you linking to the system requirement page?

This software was released in 2006-12-04 and this torrent was uploaded in 2006-12-12. I can only assume it's final, especially with that SERIAL CODE. :)"

,bananafiend,2007-02-15T14:12Z,"Something is wrong. I've tried to install by mounting with a virtual drive, as well as extracting the files from the image with magic ISO, but every time I try to install, it says expression web has encoutered an error and closes.

Is this just my computer? Suggestions?"

,siiix,2007-09-21T00:29Z,"its full version and serial works

its actually new version of frontpage with a new name : )

i guess they just wanted to get away from the bad name frontpage made for it self

still i like frontpage and this new thing"
,2Perfect,2007-10-18T04:46Z,"TPB needs an upload of ""Reading for dummies"" lol... =/"
,wrgmc1,2007-10-30T03:35Z,This works great if you use Deamon Tools to install.  Thanks zuzzy.
,maxswole,2007-12-27T18:12Z,Works great with DAEMON Tools extraction. 
,tpbnc,2008-02-14T02:49Z,"i've tried a few ms  products here that didn't require activation, but when it came down to downloading template, etc., it wouldn't work.  will this work, connect, download templates, upload the website?"
,AguazulMusic,2008-07-14T08:52Z,"Should it not yet be clear to any of you:

This is Microsoft Expression Web Studio 2007 (similar to what FrontPage was before).

When you download this there are three files, a *.bin, a *.cue and a *.nfo.

The *.nfo can be opened with notepad to view the text you can see in the torrent's body.

You can either open the *.cue or the *.bin with a mounting tool such as MagicISO, WinMount, Daemon Tools or whatever you like to use.

The serial is included in the body, but here it is again: DDWJC-VFGHJ-7GFK6-9QK3D-PFTHW

And the rest is a standard Microsoft install which you should be able to work out without any problems if you know how to download a *.torrent."
,theartpirate,2008-08-18T14:34Z,Works great. This program sucks if you like working with swf (flash) files. I reccomend dreamweaver.
,Eazy522,2008-11-18T06:02Z,Awesome...so helpful!
