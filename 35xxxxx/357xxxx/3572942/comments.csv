,i2mfan,2006-12-08T15:15Z,"Good news! I have up to E18 on my computer/to process/check, 3 new episode on my PVR and 1 more to record Sunday.

Those on the PVR are out of order. I have the E22 but not E21(it's Sunday)."
,i2mfan,2006-12-09T00:44Z,"I did not take a chance and remove the hd again from the PVR to transfer 2 more episodes recorded this morning. So, I only need ep21(Terminal City) to be able to finish the series. I will still seed 1 by 1 the remaining episodes. 

In the mean time, those that can reseed the S01/S02 with 1 seeder and 10+ leechers, I would be happy for you help :D A few hours would be ok just to get more seeders on that torrent. I call it ""strategic seeding"" ;)"
