USA & Canada maps for Mapopolis Navigator for Palm OS 5
(originally uploaded to mininova.org in September 2006)

Includes outdated versions of Navigator - get the latest program version (2.35 as of writing) at: 
http://www.mapopolis.com

These are fully usable maps (not 9 day demos) with GPS and voice direction, and are version ND/06, dated either Aug or Oct 2004.  There has been an update (to NE/07) since these were first released.
If anyone has this later version and cares to make it available, fantastic!  Otherwise, good luck in downloading over 3,500 individual files!

There are certain maps that are corrupt and do not extract from the RAR file correctly, so far I have found the following:

Louisiana - East Baton Rouge
Major Roads - (9 out of 50 corrupt) - IL, IN, KS, NC, ND, ND, NH, NJ, TX

Please leave a comment on any others found - I'll try to update them at a later date.
