,Pike84,2009-05-25T01:15Z,"Very good music, but the whole package leaves a lot to be hoped for: no track numbers in track names, no sources included (CD/LP, also for example there are many versions of PTL, none of which seems to have this track listing), some errors in track names (""Cyclons in love"") etc.

It's not all 256kbps either (there's generally no such thing as ""256 kbps VBR""), not that it'd matter here a lot.

I guess all this is good in that people have more reason to buy these and support the artists - I know I have ;)"
