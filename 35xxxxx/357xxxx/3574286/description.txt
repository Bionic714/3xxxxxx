Ring in the season with Winnie The Pooh in a brand-new, full-length adventure. Share the joy and magic of the holidays as Pooh and his lovable friends celebrate Christmas and the New Year in a delightful tale about spending special moments with those you care about most. After fond recollections of a Christmas past ... the countdown to New Year's begins! Rabbit plans a party, but when Pooh and friends bother him, he starts to sulk -- threatening to move away. To appease Rabbit, everyone makes a New Year's resolution to change. But see what happens to the Hundred Acre Wood when Piglet starts bouncing to conquer his fear, Pooh becomes gloomy from not eating any honey, and Tigger ... unbounce-able! Stuffed with holiday spirit and four new holiday songs, A VERY MERRY POOH YEAR is an animated treasure that is sure to become a family classic for years to come!
