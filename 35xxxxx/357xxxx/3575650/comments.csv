,Barcodish,2006-12-20T19:30Z,"Hi Gas, once again thanks for great package. However since updating Apple Movie Trailer script won't work, i'm getting an error message telling me that there was an error setting up my GUI and that i should check my Apple Movie Trailer skinfile in AppleMovieTrailers\skins\default\skin.xml. I can confirm that the file is where it should be, but i have no idea how to edit it. Anyone else experiencing this or have any ideas on what can be wrong?"
