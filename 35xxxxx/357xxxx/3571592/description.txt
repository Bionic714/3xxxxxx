Darkstone is still a fine game, if a little dated now graphically. 
Released late '98 - DX7

Features full 3D in a colourful environment with variable zoom/angle and several hot-keyed viewpoints.  
The main quest is replayable as it consists of 7 dungeon/overland stages which are randomly selected from a bank of 21 original sub-quests each new Game. 
Save anywhere.  Large selection of spells, weapons and skills.  
Selectable difficulty levels for new games with a skilled character - characters are saved separately and gain experience etc over multiple replays.
Included is a company-made alternative plotline called "Journey in UMA" which was made as a demonstration of the new Quest Editor (- THE FIRST IN THE WORLD)

In addition, there are many fan-made custom quests - basically a whole new game, though same character, though all feature the same final dungeon for the slay-the-dragon scene.
Play solo OR with an AI partner.  Play on LAN/net.

Last time I looked the custom quests are readily available along with support and game help.  A Darkstone community exists (in English) at the German site http://forum.withingames.net/index.php, which apparently absorbed the remains of the original official site when the company went bust.

 - had this game received the attention it richly deserved,  that might not have happened. :-(  

So you're late, but not too late..... 
Minimal protection - just burn to CD and enjoy! :-D   

afterthought - 
Lands and dungeon areas are flat - no walking up slopes or stairs.  :-p
Can be cranky with some Nvidia GFX cards   :-|    - check the link for details
