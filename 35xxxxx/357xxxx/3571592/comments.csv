,AqUit,2006-12-06T18:42Z,Do i have to burn it into a CD? Because im to dumb to do that ( :D ) without an image and i cant find any images so u know if i can find a crack? 
,univibe69,2006-12-07T08:28Z,"I am not aware of a working crack. 
I probably should have posted an image instead of the files - sorry everyone, initially I was only doing it for a pal who has genuinely lost his CD.  

If people are having problems with burning/launching, I'll repost or fix it somehow, so please say.  "
,AqUit,2006-12-07T18:25Z,I got problems :( But of cource i havent tried it on a CD yet. Because i aint got one but i can buy one :) But idk to Copy the files into a CD without a Iso/nrg.

OK - and I've also posted it as an ISO if you haven't already started    

....and a correction.... it's DX6.1"
,ad.sub_zero,2007-03-05T14:11Z,if this is .iso format archive and if u have problems extracting the files you can use daemon tools to open it.
