,T[!]kki,2006-12-10T15:36Z,"Hey guys, Nice to see. its finally out :P. Could you please Seed, ill help you Seed when im done.. :D .. Thanks ^^"
,Crillie,2006-12-10T16:13Z,This is the real deal.
,Fr3z4r,2006-12-10T16:52Z,"Thanks, i have been waiting this game a long time. Please, don't stop seeding."
,mesoe,2006-12-10T21:01Z,Hey guys thanks for the torr.but this is saying that the scda.mdf is corrupted
,T[!]kki,2006-12-11T02:11Z,OMFG Could you please Seed This!! Why put it out if your not gonna seed?!?!?!? Im DL'ing with like 3k/b!!!
,xire122,2006-12-11T12:27Z,"This is NOT a fake!!


I do need some help. I use the latest version of DAEMON Tools and I used the YASU tool, but I still get the ""SecuROM"" message... "
,xire122,2006-12-11T12:34Z,"Forget my latest comment! I got the game to work and this game rocks, thanks a lot for the upload!!!"
,feathers632,2006-12-11T15:33Z,"Yes.  This is the real thing.  I've just installed it (for the person who reported MDS error message... You need to mount the mds with alcohol or daemon).

I mounted mds with alcohol and installed, ran Yasu but the game gives securom warning.  I will try with daemon instead."
,feathers632,2006-12-11T16:31Z,"Ok. Now I have the game working. I installed daemon 4.06, turned on securom emulation, ran the game and it still detected emulation and refused to run.  I clicked on the securom warning link and it took me to securom website to show me the problem.  It said I needed to deactivate a Blindwrite playdisc (or whatever u call it?) feature.  As soon as I did that, the game worked!

It plays ok.  Very impressive flyin over city on your first mission.  Smoke grenade effects are a bit pants and the HDR lighting is too exaggerated (like Brothers in Arms), but the game itself seems ok.

1: Mount the vegas mds with alcohol or daemon.
2: Install the game.
3: If you have blindwrite installed, ensure the playdisc feature is off.
4: Run Yasu and let it hide your virtual drive.
5: Turn on securom emulation on daemon.
6: close daemon and leave securom emulation enabled.
7: play the game."
,Lilleskutt,2006-12-11T17:31Z,"This doesnt work for me. I have done exactly what I should do but I just get a windows error ""Do you wish to send...blablabla"""
,Reaction_now,2006-12-11T21:34Z,why can´t it just work!?
,feathers632,2006-12-11T21:56Z,These uncracked games are always a pain.  At least this one isn't as bad as starforce though.  If I can get it working then any muppet can.
,Reaction_now,2006-12-11T23:31Z,"hehe not me,dude! haha think ive tried almost evrything, but it just won´t work for me! "
,feathers632,2006-12-12T02:07Z,I found the same problem when I went back to the game.  It crashes just after clicking the icon.  Eventually I got it started again though.  It's a great game but typical console game checkpoint autosaving lets it down.  I just spent an hour on one section only to have a hostage die.  Instead of being able to save the game I was dumped right back at the start of that section.  I realise console gamers are used to playing the same section of game 1500 times but PC users expect something better.
,feathers632,2006-12-12T09:52Z,I don't know how it would run on your GFX.  The opening mission has you flying in a chopper over an incredibly detailed mexican city.  Very similar to G.R.A.W's city but with even more detail.  I have a 7900gt 256mb and Vegas runs smoothly on it.  It runs better than GRAW.
,Churchills Dog,2006-12-12T09:58Z,"Can't get this to work. I've tried all the suggestions and it still detecting it as a ""backup"" disc. I believe when you start the game it runs a quick update that allows the game to bypass YASU somehow. If you are starting it for the first time disable your net connection and see if it works."
,feathers632,2006-12-12T12:04Z,"I allowed the game to check for update several times.  It didn't find an update and it still works.

The only time it doesn't start is when I have Daemon still resident.  If I quit Daemon leaving emulation enabled, run Yasu and start the game."
,gangsta2003,2006-12-12T13:15Z,"vad är yasu för nått och vart kan jag ladda ner det.?
What is yasu.? and where can i get it or download it.?
Thanks For me"
,T[!]kki,2006-12-12T13:25Z,Pleope could you please Seed? 
,gangsta2003,2006-12-12T13:33Z,what the fuck is blindwrite how can i no if i have that installed or not shit please can someone help me please.?
,feathers632,2006-12-12T15:36Z,If you don't know what blindwrite is then you won't have it installed.
,gangsta2003,2006-12-12T15:45Z,"ok thank you
but you told the people how to get the game working  but when i downloaded yasu i only got some fuck'd up file that wasent working and i dont understand what to do so can you please help me can you give me your e-mail adress so we can talk on msn messenger please help me.?"
,feathers632,2006-12-12T18:25Z,"Download YASU here...

http://cdmediaworld.com/cgi-bin/dl.cgi?f=YASU_104!rar

Also make sure you have Daemon installed and set to securom emulation.  Load vegas mds with daemon, run YASU and let it hide the virtual daemon drive.  CLOSE Daemon but leave emulation enabled.

Start Vegas.  I have my firewall set to ""ask"" when Vegas tried to update from internet.  I then deny and the game loads."
,pether,2006-12-12T18:26Z,"For those who doesnt get it to work.

1. INSTALL GAME
2. RUN YASU
3. RUN GAME

It it still doesnt work, you missed one of the steps."
,feathers632,2006-12-12T19:41Z,I just played Vegas again.  It crashed 3 times before it eventually started.  On this occasion it only started after I allowed it to check online for an update.  As soon as it did that then it was happy.  Once you see the cursor change to a spinning CD then you know it's ok.
,penol738,2006-12-12T23:39Z,"aaaaw, I got the game to work on the first try, but today I made the mistake to try the patch (released today), and the game didn't start. So I reinstalled the game, and it still won't start.... crap"
,penol738,2006-12-12T23:40Z,"btw, the game is great. it doesn't feel like a Rainbow Six game (pre-Lockdown), but it's a good action game. probably the most fun game I've played this year!"
,feathers632,2006-12-12T23:50Z,"Here's what I've found:

The game sometimes needs many attempts before it starts.  I tried no less than 10 times to get it to start at one point and eventually it loaded.  I have no idea what the problem is.  It's obviously securom or yasu related.  What I do is keep closing daemon and activating/deactivating Yesu and eventually vegas starts.

The game is great except for the lack of manual save (can be a prob when you play it on realistic setting since it only takes one good shot to kill you).
"
,ash9696,2006-12-13T01:45Z,"I don't understand, i have done everything i could possibly think of and every suggestion on this site as to how to get this game to work. i have been trying for almost 3 days now and still nothing............... :(      anybody have any ideas? i don't have blindwrite, i am using daemon 4.08, and yasu, i have even tried to use the mini image from gamecopyworld and all i keep getting is this error that says ""conflict with emulation software"""
,ash9696,2006-12-13T01:46Z,FUCK ! FUCK! FUCKITY FUCK FUCK !
,ash9696,2006-12-13T02:12Z,"well.......... guess some of us aren't so lucky.
i will have to wait for a crack i guess :(

When i load yasu it says it is unable to find anything to hide from securom 7 is this normal?
it hides everything from safedisc though"
,feathers632,2006-12-13T12:05Z,"That's not normal at all.  It seems you have a problem with your virtual drive software.  Yasu normally finds the drive and tells you the virtual drive letter it's hiding.  I'm using Daemon 4.06he.  I suggest you uninstall daemon and try a different version.

It sometimes takes many tries before the game loads.  The system I use is:

1: Mount the vegas mds image with daemon 4.06.  
2: Run Yasu.  It should find the virtual drive and hide it for you (it will show which drive it's hiding).
3: Close Daemon but leave securom emulation ON.
4: Run vegas and if it crashes, run it again, and again and again... Eventually what happens is that the cursor changes to a spinning CD and the  game asks to connect to internet.  I deny it and then the game loads.

I should also mention that I UNINSTALLED Alcohol 120% when I installed vegas.  I didn't want the game to detect any other virtual drive software.  I recommend you do the same.  Get rid of it.  After you uninstall Alcohol, use regedit to manually look for Alcohol registry entries."
,Schofield32000,2006-12-13T15:58Z,This not making any got Dam sense Someone please come with a nocd crack its so much easier. the asshole who came with YASU can use for his personal dickhead.
,feathers632,2006-12-13T17:47Z,Not all games can be cracked.  Disc emulation is the only option while no crack is available.
[T],Knaster,2006-12-14T04:05Z,YASU works so stop whining or quit downloading illegal copies!
,ash9696,2006-12-14T05:48Z,"ok but why does it only work for some peeps then?

i have been trying for almost a week to get this pile of crap to work, it will not hide anything from securom 7 tells me that it could find nothing to hide from it!
can u tell me why?"
,ash9696,2006-12-14T09:45Z,"Fuck here too? sweet jesus man! 

i can't get the fucking thing going!

i think it is a problem with Y.A.S.U

or mabey it is just my puter, mabey i am just too stoned to figure it out for the past 5 fucking days!"
,feathers632,2006-12-14T10:56Z,"If Yasu isn't finding a virtual drive to hide then it's down to your virtual drive software.

Do you have alcohol or some other virtual drive software installed as well?

You get a spinning CD and then it shows a securom warning?  Well then click on the link in the warning panel and see what the warning relates to.  Do you have Blindwrite installed?

Vegas rarely starts first time for me.  I have to click on the icon over and over before the game runs.  It took 5 tries last night."
[T],Knaster,2006-12-14T14:46Z,"lol you ppl must be messed up just download the recent daemon and YASU and play! It isn't that hard my, 5 year old cousin can do it."
,feathers632,2006-12-14T17:07Z,"I suspect the people who complain that YASU can't find a virtual drive, have other virtual drive software installed.  YASU probably doesn't know which drive to hide.
"
,ash9696,2006-12-14T18:15Z,"ok

i DO NOT have any other crap installed!"
,tomcat123,2006-12-14T19:39Z,"I confirm it works.
I deactivated Alcohol's virtual drive and Blindwrite's EZ PLAY thingy, then mounted and installed the game with Daemon 4.08.
After instalation, turn all emulation options in Daemon to ON, exit Daemon but leave emulation active.
Now start YASU once to hide Daemon's virtual drive and run the game. It tries to go online but i choose quit. After a while (half a minute) the game starts."
[T],Knaster,2006-12-14T23:52Z,it doesn't trying to go online it's an autoupdate and the game wont work if you update it!
,ciracara,2006-12-15T00:06Z,"I NEED THE MDS FILE, please post a link 2 it or something.. just the mds , thank you very much in advance "
,jtrory,2006-12-15T02:54Z,"Well here's my problem, which I don't see mentioned here...

Thanks for all the info. I have successfully installed the game and got it to start working. HOWEVER, it gets to the ""loading"" screen, plays music, and basically just sits there. It takes over 5 minutes for the game to get past the loading screen, at which point I get black and nothing. I've let it sit for 20 minutes and still it won't work. Any ideas? Anyone had this problem? I've tried it over and over again, and it does the same thing. Even tried reinstalling, and I have removed all other virtual drive software. YASU is running fine. I don't know what the problem is."
,feathers632,2006-12-15T10:35Z,"Sounds like a hardware/driver issue.

I have found a new problem with the game.  It started at the last level of the mexican city before you're extracted to vegas.  My screen went black (not all of it, I still had the HUD working but I couldn't see anything else).  I had to quit out of the game and it happened again later.  I'm now in Las Vegas and my HUD is also screwed.  It shows zero ammo and ""press E"" all the time.  Sometimes the screen goes black but I have found I can get it back by momentarily changing screen res in-game (you can do this without quitting the game).  The game is still playable though.  I don't know if it's a bug that was corrected in the update or perhaps this is a pre-release version? (there is no mention of beta so I doubt that).

It's a pretty damned addictive game though.

Jtrory: Are you using an ATI graphics card?"
,feathers632,2006-12-15T13:55Z,"So are we to assume that you're too poor to afford a graphics card with pixel shader 3 and so you develop a pre-teen hatred of something purely on the basis that it's beyond your reach?

Grow up and get your head out of your arse."
,Precision1,2006-12-16T12:01Z,"I got abit of problem with unziping it. The file is large then 4GB and an error message occures in WinRar when I try to unpack it. WHat can I do? 

Thx for any answer :)"
,feathers632,2006-12-16T15:07Z,"Double-click on unl-rb6v.rar via explorer and open the rar.  Then click the ""test"" icon in winrar.  If it finds and error then you're screwed.  If you downloaded using uTorrent then you should be able to get it to re-download a specified part of the split archive."
,Precision1,2006-12-16T17:45Z,"The file is fine, its just that WinRar dosent support files larger then 4bg it says"
,feathers632,2006-12-16T17:54Z,"That's nonsense.  I'm using winrar 3.60 and it extracts the split archive without any problem.

If there's a 4gb limit for you then perhaps you don't have the full version of winrar? "
,Precision1,2006-12-16T18:03Z,I got the trial version cracked
,feathers632,2006-12-16T18:05Z,"Well then there is no problem extracting 4gb archive.  Unless of course you don't have the hdisk space?

Maybe you should just go and buy the game?"
,Precision1,2006-12-16T18:11Z,"Hehe :P I got the HD space, I just dont understand why WinRar wont extract the file. It comes to 82% and then an error says it can extract it any further"
,feathers632,2006-12-16T21:00Z,Then try another extraction util.
,justren,2006-12-17T00:43Z,"The mds is located in the last .rar file, for anyone who wants to know. The securom error comes up because you mount the mdf instead of the mds. I had the same problem :)."

2) I then ran YASU 1.04, (included in this release).

3) After that I monted the .mds file with DT and turned all emulators on. (Right click on icon -> Emulators).

4) The game will install just fine.

5) I then went into the Programs->Ubisoft->Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas->Binaries dir and ran R6Vegas_Game.

The game started just fine.

First i downloaded the Torrent and i run it with µtorrent (also called utorrent)

After that i downloaded daemon tools . Check google ""Daemon tools download"".

And.. um. yea.. go into your Downloaded files folder and unzip ONE OF THE ""unl-rb6v"". You should get 2 files. Put them outside the ""tool"" folder. Now start daemon tools and you should see the icon appear bottom right on your screen. Right to the clock. Right click the daemon tool icon and press on ""virtual cd/dvd"" then ""device 0"" then mount image. Go to your downloaded files folder and press on the R6vegas.mdf (One of the files in the unzipped zip file) Read carefully and you'll understand.
