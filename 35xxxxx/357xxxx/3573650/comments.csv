,DeepPirate,2006-12-09T15:26Z,thanks...and nice seeding job.
,vankis,2006-12-10T05:00Z,I can't get the subtitles to work. I'm using MPC and K-Lite mega codec pack. Never had any problems with subs before. Any tips?
,DeepPirate,2006-12-10T05:31Z,There are two tracks in subtitles.  See if your player allows you to choose the track.

,jigga876,2006-12-10T14:01Z,any body know where i can get the dvd cover for this .. ive tried cccovers & freecover.net only getting fatal contact bird flu in america
,vankis,2006-12-10T15:13Z,"@DeepPirate: I load the subtitles but nothing happens. All subtitle menus in the player is still grey'ed out. :/ 
Maybe I'll have to try VLC or something, but I like MPc and it never let me down before."
,JimB007,2006-12-10T17:02Z,"Move on vq, I think we're stuck without subs. On the other hand this VLC doesn't work on my PC. MPC is the best it won't let you down. I hate those subs with the *.sub extension 'cse it's so difficult to change anything in it unless you convert it to *.srt (which in fact is a normal txt file)"
