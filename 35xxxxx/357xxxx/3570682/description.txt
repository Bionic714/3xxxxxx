NOTES 
After the strong debut release - Broken Voyage - newage artist Kelly David presents a big stride forward in his sound design, composition and flow. Going further into the themes of exotic distant places, here he draws on the specter found in the forbidding S.E. Asian jungles and to a distant past when the mighty Khmer civilization ruled from an immense temple city called Angkor.

In a similar way that David Parsons taps into an atmosphere and spiritual dimension of a geographic region, Kelly uses harmonically rich textures and surreal sounds along with ethnic-inspired rhythmic passages to express a travelogue of mystery, impending danger and the vastness of an area that is still being understood and explored on many levels today. Sonically, the CD is created primarily on analog modular instruments which results in a warm and rich sound. Mastered by Steve Roach.
