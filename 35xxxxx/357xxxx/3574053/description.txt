Known as Samurai-x Trust, Betrayal in America and Europe.

Video and audio are from Japanese DVD release.

Subtitles are in seperate in SMI formats.

Personally, video quality is way better than VCD like American DVD.

English subtilte is derived US release, but it seems not perfect.

I hope someone provide better subtitiles.

(sorry for poor English, I'm still studying it :-)
