,Savagebeard,2007-04-04T09:40Z,"Please Seed.... Also opening up ur upload pipeline would be more then appreciated....
"
,Savagebeard,2007-04-04T18:29Z,"Thank you....bout an hour left, I really needed this file. I too think it is absurd that Creative does not provide these files on their website for download...

I mean you buy their fucking soundcard for $200+ bucks... the least they can do is make some files availible for download just like every other hardware manufacturer on earth...."
,Savagebeard,2007-04-04T19:50Z,"omg....I have 10mb left and you stop!!!...


Please come back and let me finish the file...!!!!"
,Savagebeard,2007-04-04T21:58Z,"99.5%...... *sigh*


Why must you make me BEG???"

,tor60,2007-04-09T14:11Z,Seed someone please
,FlyingD,2007-04-22T04:35Z,"Yes, please seed."
,lane0185,2007-05-07T10:05Z,Sorry I haven't been seeding this I know there are now and probably always going to be people who need this.  I wish Creative would just get on the ball and seed this themselves but until then if you just pm me whenever you need it seeded i'll try and do it for you.
,laneran,2007-05-12T04:35Z,"http://badboy.hub.io/ has links to a lot of Soundblaster driver iso's. The X-fi one is a different size than this, so I'm not sure what's up.. maybe compressed differently :)"
