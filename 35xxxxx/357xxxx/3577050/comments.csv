,qubit,2007-02-22T17:38Z,i think we're not gonna get this stuff. that's a pity...
,Metonomy,2007-02-26T20:48Z,It stops at 94% right now. But You can do like this to watch the movie: Open the downloaded folder. Right-click 'VTS_01_1.VOB' and open with VideoLan MediaPlayer. Same for 'VTS_01_2.VOB to VTS_01_4.VOB
,Metonomy,2007-02-26T20:51Z,VideoLan is freeware and You'll find it here: http://www.videolan.org/ The movie will stutter (as many small bits are missing if the download is not complete) but is at least playable.
