This is a collection of the entire Bloodspell machinima series (see http://www.bloodspell.com) released to date. It includes episodes 1 through 14 and all available subtitles I could find. It does not include any \"making of\" material.

Using archive.org is good and noble of them, but it doesn\'t make for too great download speeds, especially as they\'re getting quite a pounding from boing boing and other sites at the moment.

All movies are Xvid \"DVD quality\", downloaded directly from the Bloodspell site.

All available subtitles are included (no subtitles for episode 14 as of the time of torrent creation).

Oh, and the movies are released under a Creative Commons License: Sharing and remixing is encouraged!
