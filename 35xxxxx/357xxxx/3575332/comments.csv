,freaktmp,2006-12-12T18:56Z,"While there are a couple of cases where the Zep wrongfully credited themselves, most of the songs mentioned here are not.

You Shook Me: is correctly credited to Willie Dixon

Black Mountain Side: based on a traditional song. If the changes merit a Zep credit or not, it's up to you. I think they do.

I Can't Quit You, Baby: is correctly credited to Willie Dixon

Stairway To Heaven: the intro is influenced by the Spirit tune. Definitely not enough to merit a credit!

Various Yardbird credits: it's obvious that UnclePaul doesn't know that Jimmy Page was in the Yardbird, and these are his songs!

The Lemon Song: partly based on ""Killing floor"" by Howlin' Wolf. After litigation from the original artist he was given part credit.

Whole Lotta Love: partly based on ""You Need Love"" by Willie Dixon. After litigation from the original artist he was given part credit."
,micnew,2007-01-13T22:32Z,...and where did Willie Dixon get his songs from ?
,MorganT,2007-01-15T00:54Z,Name one blues song that's not stolen...
,afro2000,2007-02-07T16:38Z,"No blues song was ""stolen"" you idiot - traditional music gets passed on, reworked and reinterpreted through the generations, which was what was going on in England in the 60's with the revival of blues music."
,diabloguero,2007-06-21T20:31Z,"Robert Plant admitted to outright thievery on an interview that I saw. Many artists throughout the history of rock music have lifted various riffs, phrases and lyrics from other artists with impunity.I challenge anyone,musician or otherwise to name one totally original song in the rock genre.I can guarantee that elements of other songs will be found with enough research."
,hickory420,2007-09-25T08:16Z,Red Hot Chili Peppers - any song (other than higher ground and castles made of sand. those are tributes!)
,dhalgren57,2008-06-16T17:24Z,"First off. Sucky songs arent original.
Second...every rock artist steals stuff. but its virtually the only genre where artists are constantly suing each other....and the comsumers now....because the money is more important than the riffs."
