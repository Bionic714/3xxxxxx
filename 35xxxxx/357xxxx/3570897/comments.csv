,BBu,2006-12-05T14:06Z,"I've got the feeling the guy who is normally ripping the WWE stuff is gone... 

Smackdown wasn't posted here and the only available version was about 534 MB, and now this..."
,FreddeKruger,2006-12-05T15:18Z,Where's the REAL show???!!!??? We need it!!!!!!
,MarkoAlmelo,2006-12-05T15:42Z,"Can somebody tell where can i download 
WWE 1 december. "
,Hustlerluxe,2006-12-05T16:25Z,here
,Hustlerluxe,2006-12-05T16:26Z,MarkoAlmelo  see your mail
,DeltaPan,2006-12-05T17:57Z,"You need a set of codecs to play this.
I reckon the uploader stole it from XWT
and the capper from there has three elements that need to be added to Winamp to play this because oiks rip it off week after week.

This guy hasn't capped it but has just uploaded it after downloading from XWT who releases this very fast. This is what happens!
Don't download it unless you have the extra codecs and instructions from XWT! You won't be able to watch it!!!

MORPH did release last weeks Smackdown from the Fox network.
Be patient guys. The normal cappers like MORPH or OMICRON etc are likely busy with Xmas stuff.
A decent release will be out here soon enough.
If the usual scene releases don't turn up then somebody will upload the show.
Be aptient and keep checking.

Peace!"
,MarkoAlmelo,2006-12-05T18:00Z,"Hustler, i dont recieve any mail. Please can you say it here? where i can download fridaynight smackdown 1 dec"
,super 80,2006-12-05T18:13Z,den finns att ladda ner p책 meganova. d채r f책r ni hitta den. den finns d채r raw 120406. lycka till
,DeltaPan,2006-12-05T19:40Z,"Right.
At this time, i see it has not turned up here yet but this weeks raw is at Isohunt and Meganova.
The usual decent scene release by Omicron.

Go get it and leave this crappy release to die.
Like i said before, if you don't belong to XWT and get the specific codecs you can't use it and a waste of time downloading it!"
,DeltaPan,2006-12-05T19:49Z,"didn't realise at first but the torrent for Raw released by Omicron is being tracked by http://www.torrentsforall.net
However i just signed up and it's download fine.
registrations are open."
,BBu,2006-12-05T20:16Z,Thx DeltaPan for the Info!

,dfranz,2007-02-10T04:11Z,LOL... For eveyones info i did not steal this. I recorded this with my tvcap card. But in NSV a very small format. WinAMP is needed to play and i think maby the h264 patch is also needed.. thankx -dave
