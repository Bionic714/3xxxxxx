,nerys,2007-01-09T08:26Z,I don't like to even sound like I am complaining about free but maybe I am missing something ? this is just a hair bigger than I can burn onto a single DVD (even overburning to 4500 which usually fails is not enough) is there a particular reason and or solution to this ? (yeah ep 13 blows that out of the water but they all seem to be like this as if intentionally too big to fit on a DVD ?? (sometimes I can recompress the audio a little tighter but vdub loves throwing fits on stuff like this :-)
,los2003,2007-01-10T09:11Z,I'm stuck at 100% and it's not completed... Could anyone else seed it
,nerys,2007-01-13T08:48Z,is there another torrent for the complete season 4 that is small enough to burn to a DVD ? (this one is 4.79gb with the corrected E13 and still too big with the half episode) I tried recompressing the audio not only did it make it bigger ??? (VbR ??) but it made it into sloth audio so thats a no go. suggestions ??
,los2003,2007-01-14T21:33Z,How long did it take to dl

THE LAST EPISODE N13 FINAL EPISODE MISSES THE LAST 5 OR SO MINUTES!!!! maybe even more but i dont know how long the original is anyways it just gets cut off in the middle of a scene. how fucking annoying is that?"
,Granchy,2008-05-22T13:18Z,"It seems like the quality gets worse as the season goes on.  I just watched Refugees (ep4) and holy shit was the audio and video quality horrible and out of sync.  I'm going to download some episodes from the other upload here and see if it's better quality.

I've downloaded and watched the first three seasons, and the quality there was a lot better,
probably because they were DVDRip, and not TVrip."
,Myshkin,2008-06-06T12:26Z,"Quality of first three episodes is decent. Episode four has serious glitches lasting about two minutes about 15 minutes in after which the audio gets out of sync. 

Look for a better torrent."

,kbowk2,2008-08-14T07:35Z,"Man the ppl complaining about the quality of this torrent are stinky cheeseoids.  A small glitch in e 4 for about 1min, and some little blur in corner for a few episodes.  And download the last episode from somewhere else as it is not complete.

Otherwise, this torrent is great.  I have watched e1-10 (all the way through) thus far and FIND THIS TORRENT TO BE OF GREAT QUALITY.  Those ppl who had a moan and groan probably need to buy a blu-ray HD DVD thingy as there is no need to have issues about the quality here.  Best things in life are free.

THE WIRE ROCKS.  Not as good as 'Breaking Bad' thou.  Check it out NOW!  "

But hey, I don't see no alternative so what you gonna do about it?

Cox Communications just shut my internet off.  When I called to ask ""WTF"" they sent me to the security department.  There, I was told that HBO had contacted them to have me turned off.

They have a 3-strike policy so I'm back on again but consider this a friendly heads up.

This one's being watched folks."
,frijolito,2008-09-30T02:28Z,"@Squrm: Your ISP shut down your access because HBO contacted them?

And then they gave you one more strike so it's cool now?

This smells like bullshit man. First off, if your ISP didn't get a cease&desist letter from someone's attorney, they can't do squat. Second, they just reconnected you because you get a couple more strikes.

Basically dude, what I'm saying is: proof or STFU."
