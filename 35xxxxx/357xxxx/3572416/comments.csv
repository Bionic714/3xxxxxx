,nightowl4064,2010-02-17T08:57Z,"Nice, this torrent has a fucking VIRUS! THANKS ASSHOLE. It'll lock your task manager (like all others) and won't allow you to open any anti-virus programs. I was lucky enough to have one of my security programs open already. jtsusftav.exe is the virus, spyware, trojan, or worm or whatever it is."
,celticwarrior22,2011-09-24T03:54Z,"Firstly @Kefissos, great upload, thank you.

Secondly @nightowl4064, what are you talking about you prick? You don't get viruses from mp3 files!"
