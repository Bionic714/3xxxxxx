Also if you want let them know that the only way you could get to view this mini series was in torrent form, and you would have no problem watching an ""offical"" torrent that including the commercials.

Befroe you start bitching remember there the people that pay to make these, if the content is this good i dont mind watching the commercials. Thanks guys and enjoy."

,Sayyad,2006-12-20T08:16Z,Ok fixing this as cyber857 dont seams to seed anymore
,cyber857,2006-12-22T01:27Z,"I seed, unfortunetly dexter season 1 is done so i stop my other up loads as there was 50+ other people who finished this, and am now uploading dexter season 1, i don't have alot of up speed so get a torrent up then reseed all my other torrents, if you want to bitch bitch at those people who stop there torrents at .015 ratio, i have on average about 12.5 ratio for all the data i upload, after the first 2-3 days when the first bump goes though only 1 or 2 people stick with it to seed, thats not my fault, i will be reseeding when im done upping dexter."
,cyber857,2007-01-20T22:51Z,"Dear filesharers, it appears that folks no longer have good manners and seed to a ratio of 1 when there done downloading (if they did there would still be seeds for every torrent) as this is just a reality I will be re-seeding everything I have uploaded these Re-seeds will take place on Monday and Tuesday of each week and I will join the Swarm in Inital-seed (super-seed) mode, That is i will show up as a peer and not a seed. My program will stop uploading if the avablity is greater than 1 for the partial swarm i have connected to or if there is any other full seeds (this allows me to keep all the torrents alive in the most effecent manner). Please keep these torrents running on Monday and Tuesday to help spread the data. And as always the best thing you can do to help is to seed, if you would like to join me Mondays and Tuesdays please feel welcome to share (perferably in seed mode)."
