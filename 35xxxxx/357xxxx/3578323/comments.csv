,IceMaster,2006-12-17T06:53Z,Downloading official game patches on a pirate software website is asking for trouble.  Get the patches from the official website to ensure they are malware-free.

It's too bad they don't post an md5 or other hash of the patch on the official site. Then people could download using any means and check it using the md5.

For what it's worth, the file comes directly from FileShack. IceMaster or someone else, feel free to download it from there and compare. "
