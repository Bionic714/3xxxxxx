,fblaa,2006-12-11T08:33Z,"The DVD 2 from the 8 GB download was not working with my computer, stopping with a faulty cabinet-file. I downloaded this from Rapidshare. The simulator requires about 14 gigs of harddisk-space, and need to run on a fairy quick system to run smooth with high details. Where FS2004 ran good on a 1.7 MHZ laptop, this will only work with the lowest settings, and even then you have to be patient..."
,fblaa,2006-12-11T12:31Z,It's fairly and 1.7 GHZ

,chadramouli,2006-12-26T10:42Z,how can i download this torrent...... it is giving the file with a size of 20k or some thing
,fblaa,2006-12-26T14:34Z,"I do not know if it will work if you burn it onto a dvd.

To download this you need a torrent program. Click download and then open, not save."
