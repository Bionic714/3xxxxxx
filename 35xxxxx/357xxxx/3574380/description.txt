It has gnome-2.14, gcc-4.1.1, vlc with xvid, and an overlay with Lu_zero's 2.6.16 kernel - it is currently set to boot from the standard SCE kernel.

***warning***
1) The tarball is unchecked as I don't have the time to do a test install
2) Gnome is pretty well untested - I ran a terminal and used vlc - so don't moan to me if nothing else works:) I prefer the command line.
3) distcc is installed, remember to change the host ip's if you enable it:)
