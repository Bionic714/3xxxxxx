,Warlock13579,2006-12-20T23:11Z,Hmmm very nice. I really want to download this but for some reason it wont add it to my downloads. Any idea why it wont add it to let me begin downloading the files? Thx in advanced.
,Warlock13579,2006-12-20T23:46Z,"Ok it says ""Failed to get Torrent Traceback"" I haven't that problem with any other torrent. is there something I must change to try and get it to work? Also i am using BitTorrent for all my downloads."
,whisperer,2006-12-22T04:37Z,"Are there any seeders for this?   I have been trying to download it for a while now, and there are about 90 or so others but i havent seen a single seeder?

kev"
,coney_123,2006-12-22T12:10Z,"the problem is, the file is so big it's gonna take a while before there are any more than 1 seeds! Just be patient I'm afraid!

And Warlock, you could try using uTorrent, or Azureus. If that doesn't work then I'm not sure."
,snapdragon470,2006-12-23T11:03Z,"Could someone please seed this?

,TPLRAR,2006-12-25T09:52Z,"Sent a message to u. But Im new to Pirate Bay so i dont know how to even read a response so jus wonderin what to do if the pro tools ask me for digidesign hardware, it wont start."
,Da K,2007-01-08T00:47Z,"Hey you guys, you will need some sort of Digidesign hardware to use pro tools. M-box, digi001 digi002. Sadly m-audio does not work with the standard edition of pro tools just the pro tools m-powered version.

Hey Coney, do you know if these plugs work with version 7.3?"
,aldo2005,2007-01-11T07:44Z,"Please, are there any seeders? "
,bdmgroup,2007-01-30T22:45Z,"Hi, I am new here;
can anyone tell me where I might find M-powered 7.1....."
,whyme13,2007-02-26T03:38Z,The protools Le 7 didn't work. It gave me an Access Violation Error every time I tried to open it. 
,tayl0124,2007-03-22T06:16Z,Does anyone know where I can get a demo version of pro tools??  I want to make sure it works with my laptop before buying an used mbox.
,slowbeat,2007-03-28T14:08Z,"what are u stupid?
protools only works with digidesign sound cards!"
,tbombers,2007-04-04T21:27Z,I cant seem to unlock reaktor 5 and Reason i cant find the serial numbers and the keys can you tell me where i can get them
,tbombers,2007-04-04T22:16Z,Can anyone tell me what the serials are for reason and reaktor 5 and such!!!!!
,tbombers,2007-04-04T23:30Z,somebody send me a message on how to get the serials for reaktor 5 and reason and I cant find anything in the files or i cant figure out how it works
,myartismygod,2007-06-16T02:08Z,"This is a sweet release. Seriously everything you could need for ProTools LE. I just have a small studio and already had Pro Tools & Reason, but still found 1.2 gigs of extremely useful plug-ins. Thank you."
,jmose01,2007-08-02T23:36Z,"keep getting error for reaktor 5 serial number is bad and to activate serial key tool...when I click  on key gen it genrates a new serial # but the auth genrate button says error.

Also when recycle 2.0 was installed it says the pdxrecycle20crk that i believe is to put in genkey has no file found. Please help!!"
,rosswatt,2007-12-04T19:01Z,i only downloaded recycle and ye need orig disc on start up and the keygen is a trojan !!!!!
,tripper511,2007-12-14T01:57Z,"The keygen isn't a torrent. Stop using avg.  It only comes up as a trojan because it is not a file that's made for the computer.  It generates key's to crack programs, that's why your computer doesn't want it."
,kingoftaurus,2008-03-26T11:53Z,"heres a new one

,matchlight,2008-08-06T20:23Z,"First off Pro Tools LE won't work by itself. You must have digidesign hardware. As far as the plug-ins go, some I couldn't get to work. But in the end, for what i did get out of it, this is probably the sweetest torrent I ever downloaded."
,matchlight,2008-08-12T22:06Z,Also the Reaktor plug-in I couldn't get to work on 4 or 5. I've tried several different resources and still couldn't get it to work. Any suggestions? And a note to anyone using the waves plug-ins in Pro tools... Some are demos... meaning that when you bounce your finished product to disk (while converting) it will completely eliminate wave files on the edit window like you never even recorded anything on the track the plug-in was applied to. Make sure to save a copy before bouncing to disk!!!! 
,R4NS0M,2008-10-26T03:46Z,AWESOME
,ronrico123,2008-10-27T20:50Z,"How come the ssl 4000 bundle pack haves no set up for them, or how do you install it?"
,Thabz,2008-12-24T22:56Z,Pro Tools has a bunch of vsti with em.... The stuff that the company makes...  Why don't somebody do those? All of em.... go to the site and find out what i mean.. they are bad ass !! I'm gonna use pro tools for everything once i get them.
,d-nial,2009-01-04T21:30Z,"Just click the file and let it stay on the screen it takes time for it to accumalate all the data. and it depends on serveral things but just click the torrent and wait. it will work then you can download it using bitcomet (if youaint allready have that) 

So when the file says downloading torrent just let it stay and it will work. but it takes several minutes peace!!"
,snysh,2009-01-11T02:28Z,i dont understand how to install it...when i finish downloading the waves folder out of all the plug ins u upload...i get alot of rar files...and i unrar them and its another..so i unrar that too..and it giving me a error about the volume of some file  or some shit...how should i install this plug in????      my email is killer42004@yahoo.com
