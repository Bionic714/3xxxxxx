quote: for the sound problem you can re-encode the movie with virtual dub. when you load the movie the program itself will detect the problem and give you guidance. after setiing the sound to full prossesing mode you must  select: file-> save as avi. this will take approx. 30 minutes"
,skoupro,2007-04-15T08:19Z,oh and not to forget before saving as avi you must also select video->compression-> and a codec to encode your video. the best quality is to use the initial codec(xvid). no need telling you must have a codec pack installed

,forsignup22,2007-07-21T20:03Z,I might be kinda dumb because I can't figure out how to play this file.  I've tried Windows Media player and VLC.  I've also downloaded DIVx and Xvid.
