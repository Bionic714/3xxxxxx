,killcycle,2009-03-30T22:12Z,"Everyone on here seems to be complaining about there being no seeds but now that your downloads are completed i don't see you seeding so don't beg people to seed if your not going to.

To anyone with some respect, please seed i've been leeching this all week and i'm stuck on 33%, I'll seed this for a whole year afterwards as i don't plan on deleting it.

Much appreciated..
"
,killcycle,2009-04-23T00:56Z,"I'm still stuck on 33.6%, been here for a couple of months now.

I need someone thats fully downloaded this to seed it.

I've uploaded my 33.6% to many peers i ain't the only one stuck.."
