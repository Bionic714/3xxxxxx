,torsol,2006-12-11T22:45Z,"This must be unlocked for pc use, doesn'it?  As it says ISO, my guess is that there is no unlock code within..?"
,nacos,2006-12-12T00:06Z,"No, did not find any unlock!?"
,torsol,2006-12-12T08:01Z,"Does it still ask for an unlock key when installing then, or is this function changed to make it work?"
,beefybogtrotter,2006-12-12T20:46Z,"When asked for the 25 digit code type DEMO. This will unlock it on the PC. There is little point putting a full unlock code up as it will only do the same as DEMO and let you look at it on the PC and still not let you upload to your GPS without the unique code required.
Send your unit ID to gpsreply@shiftmail.com and I will help with your code."
,msudude,2006-12-13T04:46Z,send my unit id? do you have a keygen?
,olenbrumm,2006-12-13T04:52Z,"Yes he have, and the ""help"" with the code costs 30$ for each region, look up ""piracy""  :-)"
,tuchwood,2006-12-13T11:44Z,"Sounds nice with personalized codes, but as a start, does anybody have the 25 digit DEMO code?"
,nojman,2006-12-13T19:25Z,"Jag provade att maila snubben och fick en kod som gällde 14 dar. Han har alltså möjligheten att tidsbegränsa koden + att låsa upp alla sjökort på 25 tecken! Undrar hur den håller reda på att den bara ska funka 14 dar,när den är nerladdad i GPS:en? Sen ville han ha massa dollars för koder om dom skulle vara permanenta...
Friluftskartorna som finns här är ju redan upplåsta och klara,behövs ju inga koder....?!?"
,torsol,2006-12-13T23:11Z,"No.  The topo maps are not unlocked, they have never been locked, that's why.  But in order to unlock the map to use on your pc, you don't put in a 25 digit code on this one.  Choose to do so, but instead you type DEMO like the man says.  It works.  That means it'll work on your pc for looking up map details, printing maps and with a gps if your computer is connected to one.  However:  In order to load these maps into your gps, you need to unlock them further.  The beefybogtrotter will send you a code to unlock the maps for your gps ID number for a forthnight.  Later you have to pay him in order to do this operation.  I doubt that anything will happen to your gps-transferred maps, but as soon as you have deleted them to make room for other maps, and want to reinstall them to your gps after expiring date, you might get trouble.  Maybe you can fix it by reinstalling the whole shebang after cleaning out every garmin code (because that's where he has put the time limit)"
,olenbrumm,2006-12-14T03:43Z,"The maps will NOT work after expire date, not on your PC, and not on your gps unit. You can check the exact date in mapsource, after you have entered the code, go to Utilities -> Unlock Maps -> Next -> Viev my installed unlock codes -> select the code and choose properties, after the date you can see under Expiration, nothing will work unless you pay him. "
,olenbrumm,2006-12-14T03:51Z,"I don`t know if this is the same dude, or not, but if you email yourgpsunlocked@hotmail.com

you will get this answer:

We are selling unlock codes to those who are willing to pay for it. My prices are £30 paypal for a full unlock for City Navigator/Select, £15 for a Bluechart region and £150 for a full Bluechart CD unlock (capacity to download ANY region to your Garmin GPS unit). These prices are tremendous savings from those of Garmin. I also give discounts for more codes ordered. Payment is through Paypal. Send me your Unit ID and serial number and I will send you a time limited trial code for your unit. The code will stop working after a few days. You will then know that I can provide the goods. Let me know if you are still interested. Thanks for your mail and Regards, Marco Polo"
,torsol,2006-12-14T18:38Z,"Goody!  But I guess it doesn't work with any gps?  By the way olenbrumm:  I cannot find an expiring date as long as I just wrote DEMO instead of a 25 digit code.  So I guess it will work fine on a pc with that one, but not with the 14days worth code.  Then just type DEMO and start it again, or use the code from MinSin."
,torsol,2006-12-14T18:44Z,"DEMO is not the name of a 25digit demo code, ""DEMO"" is exactly what you are supposed to write instead of a code."
,Mapcopy,2006-12-14T23:04Z,"DEMO works to show the map on my PC, but it also locked all the other maps in a demo mode.
I had to go into the password menu and remove DEMO, then BC8 was locked again, but all my other maps was OK again."
,Mapcopy,2006-12-16T13:45Z,"Yes you can load the chart to your GPS, but just i Demo mode.
You can move around on the map, but look at your satelit fix, they are all at ""good"" also if you are in a mine 100m under the ground.

The one that have the cracksolution to Garmin maps have some relation to Garmin, if not somone else soon will make a crack to.

I am not an expert on programming, but Garmin is using a logaritm that they make in encrypted Borland, they make a change in some files with exact same size so we cant see where the difrence appear.
At first I just thougt they did a change in registry, but it is not as easy as that."
,soagro,2006-12-17T01:07Z,"To view locked maps type in demo as suggested. Yes it does mean that while DEMO is in the codes that you can't transfer any maps to your GPS. It is easy as suggested to delete the DEMO key and use your other maps as usual. All your installed maps with keys will upload again. Even if you were given a key you couldn't upload it to your GPS because it wouldn't be the key your GPS needed.

The time limited code that you can get unlocks the map for a set period. It doesn't affect any other maps nor the ability to upload and simply stops working at the end of the set time. You can use your GPS to try a map. The ""view my installed unlock codes"" function can tell you when the code expires."
,1deasea,2006-12-18T03:30Z,"Thank you for the download and the comments!

Hopefully ?beefy..? will see the error of his ways during his Caribbean cruise on his ill-gotten gains  and share with us how to upload these maps to our GPS :o) 

I tried ?MinSin?s"" code. It appeared ok when installed but when MapSource starts it says (and I find) the map detail locked! 

There is some consolation in that the tide data looks to be up loadable to the GPS!!.

,roboknave,2006-12-18T16:38Z,"Can't believe someone is actually charging for unlock codes.  $30?  I guess that is better than Garmin.  Hopefully they don't find you :o  ... They might want their money...  Well, guess I'll just stick with making my own.  It is almost always cheaper to make your own stuff.  At any rate, glad to see the data is free at least."
,roboknave,2006-12-19T18:31Z,"I notice on a lot of these forums that people seem to think there is a ""magic"" unlock code that will unlock something for their unit.  As people here have pointed out, there is no magic unlock code.  Codes are unit specific.  So any posted code is only useful for the person with that unit.  Also, codes have expiry dates, and product info.  So you need multiple codes for multiple products.

I also notice a couple of people selling unlock codes.  Hopefully people don't buy into those.  If you are going to pay for a code in the first place, you might as well pay the source so at least they can keep the map info updated (meaning you might as well spend your money with Garmin).  It is expensive, and I believe Garmin does its users a disservice by pricing the way they do, but it beats paying leech money.

I've gotten quite a few requests for codes.  Hopefully the codes I've handed out have worked out for those that I've handed them out to.  Its kind of my Christmas present to this community.  I know people would really just like the lock pick, but I won't hand that out.  It took work to do it the first time, and I don't need Garmin changing the ball game again.  When Garmin decides to change the algorithm themselves, then I'll hand out the unlocker.  I know that sounds harsh, but I'd rather keep the ability to hand out codes an option, than to just close it entirely.

At any rate, I do want to thank the people that offered to post data.  I'm still looking for the New Zealand data as well as South Africa (didn't know they made that)...  I don't know if any of the topo data is locked, but if it is, I'll be looking for that too.  I probably have a source, but I'd rather not put all my eggs in once basket.  Also, I don't have V9 of anything so I cannot build codes for that until I bother downloading it.  I don't know what V9 of Europe or even NA has to offer, but if I need it I'll post another request.

After the New Year I'm not going to be handing out unlock codes for a while, so if you really need one, send me an e-mail before the New Year.  Anything coming in after the new year will just end up in /dev/null...

And to yourgpsunlocked@whereveritis.com as well as beefybogtrotter, give these guys a break.  You've already stolen garmin's data, why are you taking these people's money?  The data isn't enough?  People are always looking for good hackers, so I can't believe you can't find boatloads of money without taking money here.  If it weren't for the fact that I'd rather keep Garmin in business updating data and being able to unlock GPS's at will, I would hand out my unlocker just to stop you guys from suckering Garmin users."
,hirulog2,2006-12-27T21:47Z,Come on boasters - post at least a 25 character key for unlocking the PC!!! 
,gpsnut,2007-01-08T14:57Z,Looks like I missed Santa and his code give away.  Does anybody have the code to unlock the maps for the GPSMap 76 model?

,jonis500,2007-01-28T22:30Z,"Maybe if someone posted his/hers 10 digit UnitID and a workin 25 digit key, at least you could maybe  use this one with a pocket pc since you can use GpsGate to change your UnitID.. Just a tought."
,happytrousers,2007-02-14T22:05Z,I bought a lifetime code but my gps unit has stopped unlocking the maps. Mapsource says code has not expired and uploads to unit ok but cant use map on unit.  Any ideas please. 
,monkster926,2007-03-10T06:58Z,"I can say for certain that if the codes are ""unit specific"" that none of them work with the 76CSx. I tried them. However, Metroguide V7 is comparable to Bluechart V8 - at least for Florida's Gulf Coast. Metroguide V7 can be found without need for an unlock code ie fully unlocked. http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3597263/Garmin_Mapsource_Metroguide_North_America_v7_-_No_unlock_needed"
,robohack,2007-06-05T20:23Z,"I don't know how active this torrent still is, but to those still PMing roboknave, read the post.  I don't hand out unlock codes anymore.  Either find a pay-for-play hacker, or pay Garmin.  Also, just as a note, I pulled that nick off an internet search... I used to get PMs from a guy on E-bay who seems to be getting responses for me.  You won't find me on e-bay that way.  I also don't log in to that old account.  Too many damn PMs and no way to send them to /dev/null... I'm only trying to get the PMs to stop.  Don't PM me at this account here.  I won't read it.  Maybe yourgpsunlocked can field the requests... find him and PM him... he takes money, but at least he'll respond."
,Jeff721,2007-06-23T00:37Z,"Robohack, 

I know you do not answer you PMs or anything like that.  Could you please contact me, I have few questions to ask you.

Thanks.

,eutueu,2008-01-25T00:32Z,what is this map ID?
,sikhall,2008-06-19T07:46Z,"Hey....

Why don't you find it by yourself ( it's very easy).
First of all: Install the map on your computer.
Then run the "" MapSet TollKit "".
Now you can see the Map Id."
,sikhall,2008-06-19T07:48Z,""" The Programname is as follows: ""MapSet ToolKit"""
