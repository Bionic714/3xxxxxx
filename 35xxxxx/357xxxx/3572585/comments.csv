,synfinity,2006-12-07T21:06Z,Totally brilliant album (nothing to do with Lemmy being in it...) I bought this when it first came out & I've never seen it again since in any format - thanks a lot!
,akrako1,2006-12-08T21:43Z,Lemmy plays Rhythm Guitar on this one...  he switched to Bass when he first joined Hawkwind...  BTW Sam Gopal is the tabla player's name
