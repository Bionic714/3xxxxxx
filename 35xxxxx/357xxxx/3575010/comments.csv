You download and open the imagefile, I use daemon-tools to open it. And then I do a DVD copy with Nero 7. Really easy. :)"

,tonybr,2007-01-13T12:18Z,"this is a simple explanation how to burn ps2 games

1. You need Alcohol 120% and win rar and dvd- discs dvd + discs will not work.

2. After d/l the game extract with win rar if you dont know how to do this, right click on the first part of the file then select extract to folder and select where you want to put it i suggest the desktop then you know where it is.

3. Once it has extracted you should have a white disc image on your desktop this is called an iso image.

4. Open 120 and select ""image burning wizard"" when this opens click on the browse tab then select the image which is on your desktop. It will then be in the address bar now select ""next"" ensure you have your disc in the drive all you then have to do is select ""start"" wait around 12 minutes for it to finish and you now have your game on disc.

If you find this helps you please spread the word there are to many people struggling with an easy task!!"
