,eezza,2006-12-12T16:33Z,What the heck? 15 instead of 14? Doesn't sound good..
,BBu,2006-12-12T16:35Z,"Read the descripton:
""E14 was supposed to air but e15 was aired instead.""

That's Canada... ;)

They also aired the second episode of ""Grey's Anatomy"" on its season premier instead of the first episode."

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3575460/Stargate.Atlantis.S03E15.HR.HDTV.AC3.2.0.XviD-NBS"
,BBu,2006-12-12T18:24Z,"There are no subs at all, the uploader mistaken the the text from the nfo with the subs.

English episode, no subs.

And there seems to be no 350mb version, but I downloaded this one in 30 minutes... so I don't care ;)"
,Networx,2006-12-12T18:49Z,"What channel in Canada is airing this? I've got the Canadian Movie Network HD channel from my cable company but they're only showing repeats of Atlantis right now. Sure would like to know where I can watch it in real time and tape it with my HD PVR. 

Thanks!"
