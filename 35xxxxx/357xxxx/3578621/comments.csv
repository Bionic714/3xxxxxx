[T],Knaster,2006-12-18T01:26Z,"Hey nice upload, this is a really great game."
,MengorMarli,2006-12-18T14:41Z,Thank you i was looking for it for years and now i found. Seeding time from 14.30 - 2.30. Middle European time
,Crillie,2006-12-19T12:42Z,Nice thx!
,V5Spectre,2006-12-19T13:32Z,"I will be seeding this crap forever. I loved the first, is the sequel better?"
,MengorMarli,2006-12-19T14:55Z,Hmm its a little bit different. I really like because its more simple in a few parts like building your ships but its also shorter you just need about 2 hours for one camapaign
,Oma_trekkie,2006-12-20T01:35Z,"Am I the only one who gets the following 'happy' message?

'Unable to load from file:screen/CHARSET.bmp'

XP, have applied crack (directly to forehead), tried various compatability modes and fiddled with the setup thingy... 
Any suggestions?"
,*Kwazar*,2006-12-20T02:15Z,"About message 'Unable to load from file:screen/CHARSET.bmp'

Try to download the 1.08 patch (ig2_v108.zip)
http://www.strategyinformer.com/pc/imperiumgalacticaiialliances/patch/207.html
it works for me"
,Oma_trekkie,2006-12-20T10:33Z,"Thanks, *Kwazar*!
Worked like a charm..."
,andyman32,2006-12-24T23:31Z,You guys better seed... I'm only seeding a few more hours and I'm the last seeder in the swarm. (piratebay's scrape data is wrong here)
,andyman32,2006-12-25T20:27Z,"I just blocked all low-percentage-completes. We should have two additional seeders in a few minutes, as long as they don't hit & run."
,MengorMarli,2006-12-27T23:15Z,I will seed for the rest of my life i really like this game.
,andyman32,2006-12-29T04:21Z,"Hey guys, out of charity I'm going to leave this in my 'more or less permanent' seeding group, since everybody seems determined to hit & run. But I'm not going to give it priority. I can only upload at about 6KB/s. I've already uploaded 3X and there are still 23 leechers and zero other seeders in the scrape data. If you can sit tight for a week or two you'll get it; I'll leave it running."
,panther07,2006-12-30T22:17Z,thanks for seeding...i never thought id get my hands on this 'lost' game...but to my dissapointment after installing and everything i still get the disk not found error...help? i used the crack but it didnt seem to work...i really wanna play
,MengorMarli,2007-01-01T15:11Z,You have to mount the different Images for the Campaigns and the first for the Scnenarios
,panther07,2007-01-02T05:25Z,"that still didnt help...i mounted the 4 .iso files...but after installing it still gives me no disk...when i try to put the crack in, it says its a cd and i cant edit...and if i try to edit it without mounting it..well then its not an iso file anymore...so, where does the crack go?"
,MengorMarli,2007-01-02T05:51Z,"Thats really strange maybe you should try another crack. http://m0008.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_imperium_galactica_2.shtml#Imperium%20Galactica%202%20v1.06%20[ENGLISH]%20Fixed%20EXE

try this one maybe works than."
,grateful_seeder23,2007-01-06T08:18Z,Please seed guys! Don't just download and run. I really want this game .....would seed for at least a week.
,ceyron,2007-01-19T06:51Z,OMG so frustrating only 15kb/s :(( plz SEED...it's downloaded 320 times but only 13 ppl seed...anywayz TNX MengorMarli 4 shareing this great game
,powerpillpacman,2007-02-07T19:58Z,after i had unpacked everything and exchanged the crack for the original exe.i then load the game up[ which is fine. but when i try start a senario or campaign it asks for the CD why?! ive bin looking for this game for months and after days of downloading it wont work!
,MengorMarli,2007-02-08T11:45Z,Did you mount the first CD because its no a noCD crack its just a crack to dont need the orignial cd.
,Starlord-99DC,2007-04-28T03:01Z,"For first: Thanks the uploader for seeding! I'm since ""Reunion"" (no, NOT X3: Reunion) a big big Fan of this cool and fantastic hungarian gameprogrammer. His Games are just amazing! After that it was a must to have Imperium Galactica, then the second part and the third which called ""Nexus"". 

Unfortunalety this here is only in english language, i'm still search for the german one. After testing this one here and used the INCLUDED ""Patch/Crack"" i was wondering. No Backroundmusic, allways ""low memory"" Messages and and and. Then i kick off this big shit of in this download included ""ig2.exe"" and apply for first the OFFICIAL ""V1.06 Patch"" and after that the ""Official"" V1.08 ""ig2.exe"". And look there: All does work fantastic and perfect! With Music and all best effects. System: XP and Vista. 

So: PISS OF THIS REAL BIG SHIT INCLUDED ""Patch"" (ig2.exe), which you will find in this download an KICK IT OFF outside your Window! Download the OFFICIAL V1.06 Patch and the fixed V1.08 ig2.exe, apply the patch, copy over then the V1.08-exe and habe phun!"
,newschooler,2007-11-09T02:02Z,"Hmm simple question: How do I install this? There is not even a setup.exe file.

When I click Imperium Galactica 2 Update v106.exe it generates setup.exe which doesn't install the game AND a clokspl.exe which does nothing.

Any help would be appreciated. Thx"
,newschooler,2007-11-09T02:37Z,nevermind I found it.
,riverfront20,2007-12-07T18:18Z,"I'm new at all this, how can I install this game?  I've been looking for it for years.
I've got the ISO extraction program, and I've extracted the CD files and tried to install but it keeps giving me an error with secdrv.sys
Whats should I do?"
,kamikazze_ru,2008-01-09T18:21Z,"Hey, that's up with tracker? Looks like here 16 seeders, but i get tracker status ""offline"" and nobody seeding... :(
Reseed please, i have only 300 mb to download left!"
,Elso958,2008-05-03T15:35Z,"Okay, i know alot of people have tried to explain? But i really don't get how to get this to work...

Not only are the graphics and occasional sound error showing up, but i can only view the tutorial since everything else requires CD's.

I've uninstalled it and still got hte ISO files on my computer, so could someone please explain to me what to do? Because i'm really stumped here..."
,PunkBuzter,2009-02-11T23:46Z,"where the hell can i get Imperium Galactica 3 - Genesis
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"
,Tehmulletman,2009-03-03T11:11Z,awesome game hella hard though cant even win an easy skirmish it seems everyone always declares war on me...
,ZaqH,2009-07-07T19:59Z,"ugh, so i've mounted the cd's, all of them. I open the autorun for the setup disc, click on install and it does nothing. i did this a few times and still nothing. i'm running Vista and have tried it with and without compatibility mode. Help please. rocker4darockoa@hotmail.com"
,sorenerv,2011-02-10T02:24Z,"installation says to mount all 4 cd's. i dont think that means mount all 4 at the same time but wanted to confirm that. i am getting exception errors when i mount the installation cd and the ""starter"" file will not run. when i explore the cd and try to use the setup.exe file it also does not work and ends with an error. i have tried compatibility mode and nothing seems to be working! is anyone having these problems or maybe someone knows how to get the installation disk to work? any help would be great"
,sorenerv,2011-02-10T02:43Z,"to anyone else having this issue. burning the installation cd to a disc using ""CDburnerXP"" program fixed all my installation issues."
,jaymoney,2011-02-10T20:59Z,Awesome Game. Havnt played it in Years though. Cant wait for it to download.
