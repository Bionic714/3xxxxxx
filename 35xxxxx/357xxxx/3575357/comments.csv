,fregrit,2006-12-13T02:03Z,"Enjoyed it in VLC. Ok picture/sound quality. Altough there are some very annoying ""skips"" in the second file. Some frames are missing, and it makes it hard to follow the movie."
,fregrit,2006-12-13T14:45Z,"i forgot to mention that the ""skipping"" in the movie is only for about 10 minutes. The rest is fine."
,stinky1,2006-12-16T21:10Z,"Very enjoyable movie, but yes frames are dropped in the second disk at a crucial time in the movie."
,lillyho,2006-12-17T15:12Z,How can you enjoy a movie if ten minutes are missing!?

,eemc2eemc2,2007-01-22T10:30Z,all the Roo R01 r02 r03 files did  not download all the way. try another torent or try to download it again. You can always run the SFV file which is in the each download file. This file will check the Rar file in the folder if there all good you will get a OK next to each file if not you will not get an OK. When you try to right click on the Roo file and choose extract files make a folder like open1 open 2 for each folder of the download which will be seen as cd1 and cd2. this way you will make sure that cd1 ectracts into open 1 and  so on for cd2.  good luck
