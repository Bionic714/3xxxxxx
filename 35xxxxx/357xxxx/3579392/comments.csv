,wolfskind,2006-12-19T13:21Z,Exactly that Woody Allen. It was their adopted daughter. They live happily together ever since.

,LezDawson,2008-08-15T02:36Z,"Many thanks.  With music I prefer uncompressed, but for movies I'm not after top quality, I just want reasonable quality with a reasonably small file size for downloading and seeding.
This looks like it fits the bill!  I'll be giving it a good fair seed once I have it.  Thanks :)"

Nothing wrong with rip quality though, plays perfectly. :)"
