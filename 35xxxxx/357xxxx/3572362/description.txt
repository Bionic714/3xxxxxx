"Spanned Media Distribution" is Micorosoft's term for a multiple CD-ROM installation distribution.  


Download this torrent and install Windows Vista RTM 6000 from 4-CD-Roms (for those without a DVD-burner).



If you think this is impossible and this torrent isn't for real, check out the language taken from Windows AIK (Automated Installation Kit):

"Create Spanned Media

This topic describes how to create spanned media by using the createspannedshares.cmd script to support computers that do not have a DVD-ROM drive. The script will split setup files, including Windows Image (.wim) files, into individual parts that you can later burn onto multiple CD-ROMs."

That's really all the info there is.  The installation files have not been altered in any way (other than being split onto 4-CDs).  You can install any one of the Window's Vista versions (Home, Business, Ultimate, etc.).  I trust that you can address the activation issue as you see fit, so no patches are provided--just the 4 ISO files (burn them with your favorite DVD burner).
