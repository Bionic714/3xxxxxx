,Nikitaro,2006-12-20T15:29Z,What about to seed?
,ho_yarr,2006-12-22T13:43Z,what to do when you had previous versions installed? -.-
,TheFreshestKid,2006-12-22T17:51Z,I beleive when you've had previous versions installed you have to delete the left overs of it. - TheFreshestKid
,need4speed,2006-12-23T00:48Z,Seems like a virus i woudln't recommend trying it.  I tried both methods and when you execute the exe it does nothing.  Says nothing which to me is hidden malicious software
,need4speed,2006-12-23T00:57Z,"Plus it gives you no options to uninstall.  Plus it doens't show it's process in task manager.  Yet if you delete the folder manually it says the program is being used by another application which means it's installed and hidden.  

DO NOT DOWNLOAD"
,minibite3,2007-01-07T21:12Z,doesn't work for me
,Vixter,2007-01-18T07:04Z,"It is normal for this software to act weird(such as doesn't run when executing) I have a legit version at my work and it did the same thing when installing over the evaluation version. If u already have the evaluation version installed, do a search on how to remove it from your registry or it will never run.

Hope it helps!"
