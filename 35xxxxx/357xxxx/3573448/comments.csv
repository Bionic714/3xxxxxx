[T],Tedsharer,2007-01-05T14:57Z,"To Neil_fuckface (yes I'm really creative)
I argue with people who uploads things that has already been uploaded. That's what I do. I am an uploader myself, and I know how mad I get when people upload things that already are uploaded. yuppienallenanders was first upping this release (though it was in rar). 

If I ever upload something that is already uploaded, make sure that I get to know that, cuz the tracker doesn't need duplicates."
,Vampyre_Byte,2007-01-07T02:35Z,"As you said yourself, ted, this upload is not a rar release.  I happen to prefer it that way.  Please, i don't care if you like rars, or which way is better.  I appreciate someone uploading this.  If you don't then STFU.  Anyone who donates their time and bandwidth should not have to deal with a whiner like you.  Period."
,Robinrunar,2007-01-10T18:19Z,Episode 10 tomorrow;D
,russeren,2007-01-11T14:06Z,"Hii :)
