This torrent has just the book (pdf), I couldn't find the computer program, that is, I found it, but I couldn't make it work... I don't know if there's something wrong about the file itself or if it's something in my computer. (anyway, you can download it at http://newton.nap.edu/html/beefmodel/ ).


You can know more about the book in: http://newton.nap.edu/catalog/9791.html


If anyone by chance has the program, please share :)
