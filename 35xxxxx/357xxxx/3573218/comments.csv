,ENTER1986,2006-12-08T21:43Z,"Basic seeders/lecchers rule - ONCE YOU HIT 100% FROM LEECHING CHECK TO SEE IF THERE IS ATLEAST ONE MORE 100% SEEDER IF NOT CARRY ON SEEDING TILL THERE IS.

Seeding - uploading 
Leeching - downloading "
,ENTER1986,2006-12-08T21:48Z,"Once you accuired your download instead of finishing it leave to upload. By leaving it to upload your allowing everyone one else to download off you. Its the way you got it in the first place. UNDERSTAND ? 
    In order for a download like this to not be nuked there must be atleast 1 100% seeder 99.9% just isnt good enough so therefore i kindly ask once you've finished downloading to cheeck if theres atleast one 100% seeders still active, this keep the download alive

Thank you 

Any questions mail me  x x "
