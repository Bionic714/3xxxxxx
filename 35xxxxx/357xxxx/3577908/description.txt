Dispatch Planner 1.0 USA is a 'dispatch' program (Microsoft Excel 2000 or later required) which produces a single sheet 'dispatch' based on route parameters entered. These parameters are entered including departure and destination airports, along with the flight number which you wish to fly. Referring to a large database, the program then creates a realistic single page 'dispatch' sheet containing all the information needed. This includes fuel figures, maximum aircraft weights etc. Data is read from the specific add-on (if selected) in order for the parameters to be correct specifically for your aircraft.

This sheet can then be printed easily.
