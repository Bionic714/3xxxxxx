,blankbox,2006-12-16T17:29Z,4X-AXG nice idea....but but...all those hit and runners just gonna do their own thing anyway ..that's life in the fast-lane :-[
,B744,2006-12-16T17:38Z,well im in the process of makin a flight sim based website! it will be very private... only people i know who can contribute and not just leech all the time will have a login. 4X-AXG - send me a pm sometime :) 
,4X-AXG,2006-12-16T17:45Z,"well not everybody has to be a contributor..if every leecher would also upload, it'd be madness on this website..but a 'thank you' is the least a leecher can do, especially when at the same time requesting another add-on!

I'll contact you sometime B744 ;-)"

,WinnieXL,2006-12-16T22:02Z,"I hate it when people request something, specially when they do it in the first line and don`t say thank you! So u1T show some respect and play by the rules if you have some pride."
