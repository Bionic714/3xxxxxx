Hey! I made a list of what I think I need. I'd like the refills witch has the best quality sounds. I can manage without samples, but if you got the time to upload i wont mind. I'd like something with combinators and the other synthersisers. Just plain good sounds in trance dance genre synths.

Please let me know if/when you upload...

Thanks a bunch :)

,squolph,2009-01-24T21:51Z,"Tucson_Luni520:
In Reason when adding a new instrument in NN-TX for example, click the ""browse patch""-icon and
locate the refills you have downloaded. Then simply drag the desired refill left under ""locations""
and so you have acces to your new refills."
,Tucson_Luni520,2009-02-10T12:46Z,ok cool thank you very much for your reply much appreciated
,eloman101,2009-03-01T10:23Z,"what an upload!!! Chosen Wun, you're much appreciated."
,CICagent,2009-03-21T02:29Z,"Hey,Tucson Luni
Just navigate to the reason program folder and put your refills there. 

Alternately,  if you've got Reason 4, you can use the interface to get to the folder where you have the refills and drag them to the left side of the interface under Documents, Factory Sound... and Orkester."
