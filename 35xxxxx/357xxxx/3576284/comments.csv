,darknessv,2006-12-14T02:00Z,lol..and I who dl'ed this and watched it just 4 days ago..the old version..I think.. :(
,justinprague,2008-02-22T01:36Z,"yo! there's a handful of peers but no seeders - cud we have reseed?

this is the last one of the 4 that i gotta get, stuck at 85%. max respect for releasing the quadrilogy to fit a dvd. "
,justinprague,2008-03-02T11:38Z,"reseed pls!

pretty please?"
,truthy,2008-03-06T18:41Z,"I'm at 67% at a ratio of 1.720 - please people give something back - don't be so greedy. 
justinprague - you're not the one still at 87%, are you? - more than 2kb would be nice!"
,truthy,2008-03-06T22:38Z,"count me in too for the reseed request ppl - please!
stuck at 70,1% at a 1.9 ratio after 1d 2h download"
,truthy,2008-03-08T19:44Z,now there r 8 leecher at 87% - pls reseed
,truthy,2008-03-09T05:13Z,"screw it - I've waited long enough - too bad that torrents are so short-dated - although this one lasted for quite some time ... Dec 06 - but without seeder - I don't wanna wait forever.

I downloaded a 1,37 GB Rip of the Extended Edition via edonkey (just search for 'GCypher') - converted the AC3 to MP3 and cut off the end titles to make it fit to 1.09 GB (The video Bitrate/Quality of this one is even better 1341kb vs 984kb)

at last I have the Quadrology on 1 DVD-5 finished! (for everyone who might look for another way ...)"
,justinprague,2008-03-10T22:02Z,"hey truthy - any chance you could make a torrent of your edited alien3, so anyone else seeking the quadrilogy on 1 dvd (eg myself) can grab it?

Would be much appreciated :-)"
,truthy,2008-03-12T05:27Z,"forget what i said about the video bitrate of the other one above - actually it's even a bit lower ... but still okay for two an a half hours.

so ... I did it - my first torrent *g* hope i did everything right - we'll see
here you go: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4075834
i only got ~60 kb/up so it might take some time
regards"
,justinprague,2008-03-17T11:15Z,yay! we got a seeder or 2. rock on!
