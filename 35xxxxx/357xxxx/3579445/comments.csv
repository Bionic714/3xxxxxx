,quequeg1,2006-12-22T07:14Z,"I assume the majority of these are the Digital Archive Project encodes?  how about the ones that are out on commercial DVD through Rhino,  you have some of those in the list, are they rips from the Rhino DVDs or from somewhere else?  give dapcentral.org some credit dude.  and you forgot MST3K The Movie  Otherwise great idea putting these together like this"
,FaderAbraham,2007-01-12T05:01Z,Were there ever any MST3K subtitles? I'd like some for these discs...
,tsukio,2007-01-15T20:00Z,"Real nice, thanks dude"

,lofestruck,2007-02-23T06:31Z,"Been waiting for a collection like this for ages.. Dvd or not, its a treasure to have and cant wait to watch these again... "
,Empyrealdragon,2007-02-24T08:18Z,"Wonderful idea, man.  Keep up the good work.  It's so hard to find copies of the oldest episodes of this seres from what I've seen, and I'm drooling at the chance to see some pre Sci Fi eps.

Love the covers too.  Only thing that could make em better is menus, but I can do those myself."
,Ghyll,2007-06-04T01:49Z,"This is friggin' awesome, but I'm stuck at 0.0 percent.  Can someone please seed this?"

,kurttu,2008-03-06T18:27Z,You had to talk bullshit all over the movies didn't you? Why bother uploading this much stuff if it's all ruined with your poor sense of humor?
,newfers,2008-03-30T23:51Z,"Excellent work man! Keep them coming, please!"
,legin2,2008-03-31T21:46Z,"Sweet.  Nice work, and nice amount of seeders even years later."
,tekproxy,2008-04-07T04:25Z,"You are my hero. Much thanks!

Just imagine -- because of you I'll spend hours enjoying MST3K. "
,radecoraccer1,2008-04-16T17:48Z,fucking idiot films the destroys the orginal.and who wants a fucking dumb shit theatre grop infront of the film
,PeterJayNovins,2008-04-28T19:20Z,"Thank you, these are awesome.  However I must point out that 4 gigs of xvid-compressed files becomes much more than 4 gigs when transcoded to MPEG2 to burn them onto a DVD.  So in all reality the ""35"" discs in this set actually equals more like 70 discs or more, depending on how much quality you want to preserve."
,Zomboy101,2008-04-29T01:06Z,"Im not trying to sound like an idiot, but I downloaded these on utorrent and when I open them in Windows Media Player, it only opens the audio, and I can't get the video to open. What is going on?"
,yrah,2008-04-30T05:05Z,"Thanks you so much! Have not seen nearly enough of these. Now I may overdose.
Works great on my spastic usb dvd player."
,Wolftrooper,2008-06-19T17:26Z,hey Thanks Man I Love These Things Oh And Zomboy101 Try Getting Real Media Player Or DivX Player
,Punvag,2008-09-05T16:38Z,Do you have the Mst3k movie?
[T],DivineShadow,2008-09-18T00:06Z,"Dude, seriously?... I waited for how many days to finish the dl and this is the quality? at 700MB per file you'd think the quality would be better. Are these ripped off of VHS tapes? The video is out of focus and the tracking is off on several of them. Thanks for the attempt, but a waste of my bandwidth..."
,noodlon,2008-10-01T10:35Z,"Missing almost all of season 7 ... according to imdb there are 24 episodes, any chance of a new torrent with these also? Thanks!"
,rrpostal,2008-10-02T18:18Z,"Bitching about the quality of these early ones is pointless. A few of them aren't found ANYWHERE. To answer your question, yes I'm sure some were taken from VHS, because that's all there is. Some of these, especially the early stuff is collector type stuff, you may want to look for the Rhino releases if you just want to marvel at your 1080p. If you can find better quality of some of these then Up 'em, if not your point is moot."
,rrpostal,2008-10-02T18:20Z,"I have every single episode of these on its own disc. Many people wont upload episdoes that are available via Rhino, which may be why some are missing. If there are specific eps, I'll try to get them for you. "
,sith256,2008-12-08T04:29Z,"...i think you are a god, and any naysayers about the quality well while they might have some tracking issues they are still worth a watch and out of focus? were we watching the same thing? Either way, worth the download and the time you put into this Thank you UMe2"
,tukka74,2009-02-09T16:35Z,"Ume2 thank you for this.

I would like to let people know that the quality of this download is not perfect, it is the kind of quality you would expect of an old VHS video tape. But don't let that put you off, each episode is perfectly watchable. And anyway, where else would you find such an extensive collection like this.
Download it and enjoy it for what it is... a rare and sublime collection of ridiculous nonsense. "
,ashdragon1,2009-04-30T06:48Z,Awesome mate! thanks so much for this :D  
,jbug1975,2009-06-24T16:49Z,"Thanks for this, UMe2.  I can tell you put a lot of time into all of the discs.  How do I watch the videos?  I'm only getting audio with Windows Media Player and Real Player."
,jbug1975,2009-06-25T06:51Z,"Nevermind.  Plays great with VLC Media Player.  Now, if I could only figure out how to burn it on to a DVD...  :)"
,KHE1138,2009-06-30T06:22Z,"Noodlon:

IMDB considers season 0 to be season 1. Use this for the real episode guide.

,Hodenhannes,2009-09-29T16:34Z,"Thanks so much, this is great!
And to all the people complaining about the quality, if these were hi-res movies it wouldn't be the same experience. "
,daleks,2009-11-12T22:38Z,"These programs crack me up, thank for the download and thank you seeders."
,takkun828,2010-01-13T01:49Z,imdb's episode guide starts with season one as the first three dvd's... this set counts season one where imdb counts season two and so on...
