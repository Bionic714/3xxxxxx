,staern,2008-01-06T22:23Z,Raw Power sounds distorted and really bad! The other albums sounds good. Why?

,OOHMATRON,2009-07-16T01:10Z,"Hey staern. Unfortunately the Raw Power album has been fucked up by the engineers.

They have supposedly 'remastered' it but any self-respecting engineer would agree it sounds like shit.

This is an album cited by many as one of the 'best of all time'. Just goes to show there's a lot of retards out there."
,n!tr0z,2009-08-27T00:39Z,"staern, its how they recorded it.
atleast it what they wrote in the biography.

it sounds dirty but that is why punks love it :) not just that reason but its a big reason"
,BruzeWill,2011-11-11T00:13Z,"OOHMATRON Yup a screwed up the mix but it was even worse before David Bowie was given 36 hours to remaster it to the quality you hear today. Funny thing is that in spite of the poor mix this album, IMO, is one of the best and influential rock albums ever made! Its music that is both cathartic and exhilarating."
