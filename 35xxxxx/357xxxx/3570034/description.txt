The most extensive flight planning tool for Microsoft Flight Simulator! This completely new designed tool is ideal for the proficient PC Pilot. It comes with a flight planner, a moving map and a GPS which all have a whole range of unique features never to be used in combination with Microsoft Flight Simulator before. 

FlightSim Commander 7 has a very complex flight planner for FS 2004 with High- and Low Altitude Routes, NAV to NAV Routes and Direct Routes. For the first time the user can even combine different types of route sections.

SID┬┤s and STAR┬┤s are also included as well as an automatic logbook and a direct download and a monthly update of DAFIFF files (Route Data).

More unique features in this program are included in the Moving Map which can display all surrounding aircraft, even AI aircraft in the air and on the ground. The Moving Map shows all airspaces and altitude restrictions as well as a parking aid for easy identification of the gates.

The separate GPS window displays waypoint, arrival, airport, route information and the arrival ILS with an automatic frequency transmission on the radio panel. The virtual pilot can call up the weather report in METAR format at any given time.

FlightSim Commander 7 is also compatible with WideFS.
