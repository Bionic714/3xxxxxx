,icsaruba,2007-01-17T04:29Z,"Hi Guys anybody has FlightSim Commander 7.7
yet? I am running FSX "
,Arrrr_Matey,2007-07-05T12:18Z,"This version is unsupported in many ways now. New AIRAC files cause runtime errors, there are many problems related to the age of this build. Do NOT waste your time on this, unless you are going to be satisfied with the default files (which are from '04). This version is 7.3, recommended stable version is 7.7. Patches apparently require registration and logins. Upgrade to the latest (Version 8) costs $$$ and a new key is required.

If you are interested in seeing what this does, feel free to d/load it and run it with defaults. This is a -very- nice planner. Blows FSBuild so far outta the frickin' water, it's hilarious. Try it, and if u like it, BUY version 8 matey! Arrr! = )"
