,NWE,2007-01-14T21:38Z,"BSA/MPAA/RIAA/whoever (spammer) tactic:

1. Upload appz with virus
2. Spam TPB comments with ""virus warnings"" and fake statements, to confuse people.
3. Sink PirateBay(!)

Will it succeed? Hmm... At least I download and my antivirus checks, as usual. It is rather pathetic after all.."
