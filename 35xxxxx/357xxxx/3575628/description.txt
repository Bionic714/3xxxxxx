I noticed that the last torrent for this had petered-out, so I posted mine.

Zanzarah - 

A beautiful and colorful environment where you complete the main quest by winning a succession of matches, pitting your fairies against the fairies on the black-hat side in order to free the fairyland of Zanzarah.
(.... now is warring fairies a novel twist or what? :-p  )

These fairy fights are no cakewalk!  
The weapons are all spells and take place in a series of strange "arenas" once you've stumbled upon a challenge in the village or fairy-wood areas. 

Initially, I only got involved in this game to help the wife out, but it turned out to be a lot of fun.
