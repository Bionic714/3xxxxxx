Dif Juz was an influential, primarily instrumental, British group that 

created uniquely atmospheric effects-laden music with dynamic emotional 

range during the early to mid 1980s.

Their influences seemed to primarily spawn from Dub/Reggae, but their 

style did not adhere strictly to those conventions. Their music is 

often appreciated by people who have a fondness for Ambient, IDM, 

Shoegazer, Dub, and Goth.
