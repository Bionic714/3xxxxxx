,spock123,2006-12-20T08:32Z,"What's up with mixing the movie directly with the movie? Now only swedish retards (those who don't understand english) can help seed this movie.

Why not just attach a sub file?
"

,Fliikka,2008-03-29T12:24Z,"spock123 : We acually speak english, we just have subtitles to upset you. There are severals other torrents without swedish subtitles so why won't you download on of them?"
[T],Knaster,2008-04-06T11:08Z,WTF no we dont speak english we speak swedish. 
,geonet,2008-06-25T13:50Z,"spock123  if you were a little bit smarter you'd understand that this is probably a rip taken from the swedish TV, and therefore the inclusion of swedish subtitles are unavoidable. In any case those of us who aren't swedish should be grateful for them to make these movies available. If it weren't for them you wouldn't be able to find some movies online. "
,Black-T,2008-07-12T12:07Z,why to hell the subtitles man come on i like the movie but the subtitles not that i hate the language but i don't understand that  thats all 
,bimisaurus,2008-07-21T18:12Z,"Sweden is the most prominent English speaking/reading nation after the ones who actually have English as official language. We even invented a large part of today's most common idioms.

Which is why we want movies without stupid subtitles.

Don't bash us: love us."
,Simpan27,2008-09-05T17:04Z,"Stop complaning about swedish subs!
It is a swedish site, if you dont like it then go to some other site or just download some one whitout subs!"
,oPiN37,2008-10-26T02:31Z,"This is to spock123 and all of you fuckers... you are all, FUCKING RETARDS!!! 
First of all, this IS a swedish website. What the fuck do you expect?! If you don´t want subs, go to another fucking webpage
Second, we want the subs ""bruned in"" or what the fuck you call it, becuase it´s the easiest fucking way to see a movie with subs...!!!

So all you who´s complaning of movies like this - fuck you, go to another website, and don´t disturb us Swedish - the smartest people in the world!!!!!"
,oPiN37,2008-10-26T02:34Z,"Sorry, meant ""burned in""... Got so caught up in insulting these fuckers I didn´t notice which keys my fingers pushed...

And for all you Swedish people who stand up for this site, burned in subs and everything that has to do with Sweden - KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!! =)"
