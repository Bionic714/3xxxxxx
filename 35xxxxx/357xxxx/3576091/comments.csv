,awwgoddammit,2008-07-03T18:44Z,"In case anyone is wondering...

If you aren't interested in including the ""best of"" type albums in this collection you can deselect the duplicate tracks before you dl them.

BIG THANK YOU's to europabrunch for not raring this collection. Great job bro!"
,Teddyzipper,2008-07-11T15:51Z,"i think the only one you need to leave out for doubles is ""tom waits 1992 - 2002"" but doubles might be things like live or some such thing.
Thanks a bunch Europabrunch = ]"

,Phrosty12,2009-10-10T18:29Z,"Outstanding collection. A few repeated albums, but no biggy. As for the supposed corrupted files mentioned by fatedsnowfox, I see no corruptions (even in Alice and Blood Money). Thanks for the upload."
,syuvial,2010-06-09T00:03Z,"Actually, im getting some corrupt files too. im rechecking the torrent right now, and ill poast again if that turns up with any results.

but alice and blood money were among the corrupted albums."
,syuvial,2010-06-09T00:10Z,"okay, rechecking did nothing, but i found out that its only the albums inside the ""1992 - 2002"" folder that are corrupted. the same albums in the other folders are fine.

it would be appreciated if someone who hasn't had any problems yet tried playing some snogs out of that to double check."
