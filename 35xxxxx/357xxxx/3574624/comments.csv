Yes, this is the book. :)

to zxen
It seems alright, but perhaps someone else can confirm this.

PS:
really sorry for the speed, I'm on dial-up. :( 
But hopefully it'll pick up after some people have downloaded it."
,mrdunworthy,2006-12-12T22:37Z,"I'm running 'uTorrent' and get no ""bad file info"" or such, but seeds=0 here, and peers=47. Nothing downloaded for me, so far. But as ahnaqsh suggests, can someone else confirm a download in progress? Hope so -- this seems a real gem for my uBook Reader :) Thx again ahnaqsh!"
