,eggewert2,2006-12-08T22:52Z,Very good album. Nice to see it's still appreciated out there.
,eggewert2,2006-12-08T22:58Z,Unfortunately there are no seeders for the 4 albums torrent. Someone please help us...
[V],Kefissos,2006-12-08T23:17Z,"Eggewert: Then I have to upload the 4. Albums AGAIN :-(
Folks, listen! You HAVE to SEED, when my upload are finish...Are you really so selfish? If you won't, I can't upload ANY great music anymore."
[V],Kefissos,2006-12-09T00:47Z,"I have already deleted an upload of the band Lush...sorry Guys, its your own fault, if you can't seed."
,eggewert2,2006-12-09T10:24Z,"KEFISSOS: It's not your job to upload the torrent again. You were kind enough to upload it in the first place. I was simply asking for somebody to pass the torrent on. They did. I got it now, thanks to their willingness and your kind upload. I will seed it now and then and look for leechers until about Christmas."
,eggewert2,2006-12-09T10:39Z,"Generally, seeders ask leechers to seed with a ratio of 1:1 or 2:1. I'm up to 5:1 after just one night but the thing with these torrents that relatively few people want is that even a ratio of 5 may not be enough. With a Disney cartoon 1.1:2 may be enough, but we're with the league of exclusivity, it seems..."
,volver04,2009-05-22T07:20Z,Seed please: stuck at 99.4%. I'll happily do my share when I'm done. Anyone? Bueller?
