This is the first (of 3) parts with the classic 1950's Honeymooners. Starring Jackie Gleason, Art Carney, Audrey Meadows and Joyce Randolph

These episodes have been collected in the order of their transmission date as far as possible. The original 'Lost episodes' DVDs were in awful shape and I've tried to do the best possible from them. Here is all the episodes from 'The Jackie Gleason show' 1952-1955

In 1955 The Honeymooners became a show of it's own and that will be last part I upload. The last 'Lost episodes' from 1956-1957 as well as all the special features and undated episodes from all the 'Lost episodes' DVDs will make out the second part.

As for seeding: I will try to seed 100% 24/7 until each part is available, but my ISP have it's glitches and I'll only be able to fix it during evenings CET. My upload speed should be about 768kbit/s assuming everything is OK. I'll upload the next part as soon as possible.
