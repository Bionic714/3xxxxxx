[T],towerelect,2008-02-29T15:52Z,"Thank you for a great quality download, now split into single tracks and imported into my OtsDJ Pro AV software collection for playback on my Video Discotheque.   Collection is all 4:3 Ratio and good stuff.   The VH1 classic logo is on all of them and they are titled, but I can live with that considering the rare nature of these tracks!   Thanks Dude, I owe U"
