     ├¢  
     ├¢  STURMOVIK: 1946 offers new campaigns, missions and aircraft as well
     ├¢  as many exclusive features. Pilots can fly the skies and fight
     ├¢  enemies over the Russian front, German occupied Europe, the Far
     ├¢  East and the Pacific. STURMOVIK?: 1946 also includes all of
     ├¢  previous Il-2 series content, thus bringing the most respected
     ├¢  anthology flight simulator to an astonishing 229 flyable aircraft
     ├¢  and over 300 total aircraft.
     ├¢
     ├¢  Features:
     ├¢  * New Aircraft ? 32 new flyable fighters and bombers, including
     ├¢    the long-awaited Il-10 Sturmovik, the Mig-9 Jet fighter or the
     ├¢    Arado Ar-234 Blitz bomber; plus four new AI aircraft. 
     ├¢  * New Maps ? Large new historical maps of the Kiev region, a
     ├¢    Manchuria region map focusing on the border between the USSR,
     ├¢    China and Japanese-occupied Korea, a large bonus Burma map and an
     ├¢    online Khalkin Gol / Nomonhan map.
     ├¢  * New campaigns - With nearly 200 missions, unparalleled realism
     ├¢    and attention to detail, the nine new campaigns will thrust
     ├¢    players into detailed fighter and bomber pilots missions for the
     ├¢    German, Soviet and Japanese air forces. 
     ├¢  * Alternate history - Three of the nine campaigns are a departure
     ├¢    into alternate history, focusing on hypothetical battles between
     ├¢    the Soviet Union and Germany in the year 1946 where WWII still
     ├¢    rages on. Both the VVS and Luftwaffe now have access to advanced
     ├¢    jet and rocket fighters.
     ├¢  * New features ? In addition to such exotic aircrafts as Soviet
     ├¢    mixed-power fighters, 1946 also adds an incredible variety of
     ├¢    new ground targets, including, for the first time in the series,
     ├¢    trenches and bunkers that give a whole new dimension to the
     ├¢    ground attack aspect of the simulator.
     ├¢  * Nearly 1,000 new Paint schemes ? The new planes, as well as many
     ├¢    existing ones, come with a host of historical paint schemes,
     ├¢    showing many of the individual aircraft or squadrons that served
     ├¢    in WWII.
     ├¢  * Exclusive bonus - Making of, interview videos and screenshots of
     ├¢    the new features, plus exclusive screenshots and never before
     ├¢    seen videos taken from upcoming Maddox game: Storm of War: Battle
     ├¢    of Britain. A Detailed Plane Guide, totalling over 450 pages of
     ├¢    information, gives the low-down on every single one of your 229
     ├¢    flyable aircraft, and allows new players much easier access to
     ├¢    the incredible variety of aircraft in the simulator.

     ├¢  →*←  Notes: Firstly, the autorun and setup of this game is a bit
     ├¢       dodgy. If it fails to run, try a.exe in the root of the DVD
     ├¢       or one of the autoruns in x:\10xx\.
     ├¢       Secondly, like all our releases, this has been tested and
     ├¢       working. As any single of the anti-blacklisting tools or other
     ├¢       methods is not known to be working for everybody, we chose not
     ├¢       to refer to any particular method. As was the case with Rayman,
     ├¢       this has been tested on a machine with no optical drives, using
     ├¢       both YASU 1.3 with Daemon Tools 4.06 or with the registry trick.
     ├¢       Finally, anybody who wish to proper us, using our own image
     ├¢       packaged together neatly with instructions found on public
     ├¢       webboards, should make it so the time stamps are not identical.
     ├¢       Or at least check that your release unpacks.
