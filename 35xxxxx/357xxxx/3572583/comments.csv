first , copy image to usb disk(i got 10gb wd in 3.5 usb case)
2 unplug all cd/dvd drives form mainboard
3 go to http://m1012.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_il2_sturmovik_1946.shtml

then open file archive, rename image file to NS-IL2S1946_Maxi-poseden.mdf
and copy NS-IL2S1946_Maxi-poseden.nfo
to same folder, then use daemon tools and y.a.s.u and follow instruction from game copy world.
It works for me, maye someone can find this usefull."
