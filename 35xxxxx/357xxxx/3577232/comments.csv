you will need a program called mp3+g toolz to convert the both files into a .bin file.


1) Install and run MP3+G Toolz
2) Select File>MP3+G to Bin (or Zip to Bin if files are zipped)
3) Select folder where files are stored, click OK
4) Click Start, MP3+G will now convert all of your files to Bin format (1 per track) and create a cue sheet
5) Once finished converting close MP3+G Toolz
6) Launch Nero, close the wizard
7) In Nero v6 select Recorder>Burn Image
 Choose the Cue sheet just created by MP3+G Toolz and click Open
9) Click Burn, you now have a Karaoke CD+G disc

there is also a similar way to do it in clone as some ppl experience sound and no graphics.
Procedure to burn MP3+G with an unsupported MP3+G Burner

(NOTE: Your burner must however be able to write RAW MODE)

Start with normal MP3 & CDG files in its own folder
Next convert these files with Mp3+G Toolz using the mp3+g to bin option
(this will convert the files into the same dir as your original files)
Next open Cue2Ccd choose your .cue file on the top option
Next choose where you want the .ccd (CloneCD image) to be saved
(normally keeping everything together is the best option)
Next click convert (this should be finished quite quick 2 mins max)
Next open CloneCD click on the option second in (write image to disk)
Next locate your ,ccd file for burning
Next click next
Next choose the multimedia audio option
Next choose speed (4 speed max as the graphics break-up on higher speeds)
Next choose write
Next there is no next you now have a CD+G CD created on a non-supported writer!!!!!!
