,haggisman,2010-02-01T02:39Z,"SADLY ""THE PEOPLES HISTORIAN"" HOWARD ZINN PAST AWAY A FEW DAYS AGO HE WILL BE A GREAT LOSS TO THE ORDINARY WORKING PEOPLE OF THE WORLD.

Howard was asked once whether his praise of dissent and protest was divisive. He answered beautifully
Yes, dissent and protest are divisive, but in a good way, because they represent accurately the real divisions in society. Those divisions exist--the rich, the poor--whether there is dissent or not. But when there is no dissent, there is no change. The dissent has the possibility not of ending the division in society, but of changing the reality of the division. Changing the balance of power on behalf of the poor and the oppressed

Howard Zinn taught millions of us a simple lesson: Agitate. Agitate. Agitate. But never lose your sense of humor in the process
THE AMERICAN WORKING CLASS HAS LOST A GREAT WARRIOR  THAT HAD FEW EQUAKS"
