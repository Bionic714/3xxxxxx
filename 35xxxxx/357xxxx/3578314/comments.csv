Multi-tracker torrent already a lot of seeders"
,death734,2006-12-17T02:14Z,thanks for this torrent. spam free is the way to go
,i2mfan,2006-12-17T02:49Z,"death734: Spam also in here. Look at the second file. You are force to place this file if you seed with demonoid.  It's a secondary spam/publicity ;)

ichithechiller: Next time, please be faster seeding. I would not had seeded that file if it was already available here so to not divide the leechers. ;) It's too late now. 

Both: I did not consider the contest in my torrent spam but more like a fun contest. It don't cost you money but only time. 

P.S. Seriously, is it just the fun contest that you did not like?(waiting for your answer)"

bottom line, it does not belong in a torrent for a tv show. when people see a single .rar file in a torrent, suspicion comes to mind. 

a torrent for a tv show should be 1 of 3 ways.
- a single .avi file
- a .avi file with the demonoid .txt (or other site, but i've never heard of others requiring that) because there tracker requires that (its not spam)
- untouched .rar archive

""ichithechiller: Next time, please be faster seeding"" 
this one has 12 seeders and yours has 1 seeder even though there are more leechers on this torrent and your has been out 1.5 hours longer"
,i2mfan,2006-12-17T05:14Z,"death734: I appreciate you response.

1. A rar does not auto execute(info for newbies) and those that have seen my upload(116 torrents in short time) here before know that my rar are safe anyway. I did a rar because the avi was highly ""rarable""(300KB vs 8.5MB). It was a screen capture(HyperCam) of the software I used. Also, it was not a single rar and I given it a real name.

Check First Wave here for example and feedback. I also done BSG webisodes that were in rar because I was saving a lot of bandwidth/time( on my old site and here) and had many  seeders. 

2. They are no logical reason that the demonoid or other trackers would need that file and so it's free publicity for them.

3. Because this torrent is a multi-tracker, I agree that he has more seed ""now"" . At the time I wrote my message, it still had 1 seeder.  I cannot stop mine because of those that are leeching from me.

He could had help me seed and become a second seeder but did not do that. 1 hour faster and it would not be an issue. 

4. Modern clients let check the file you want or not before leeching. It's your choice. If you don't like sample.avi, uncheck it. Your choice!

5. The way a file will be distributed or named will never be settle. 

6. Description are free form. I could say that the graphic are not needed and I should not have to scroll too far before seeing the real info. Everybody has a style until a tracker decide otherwise."
,death734,2006-12-17T05:49Z,the only reason why demonoid tags are ever in there is because the idiots at demonoid will delete any torrent that uses there tracker and does not contain that retarded .txt file
,[gist],2006-12-18T02:19Z,Anyone know why the recent episodes have not been released from HDTV source. They are of exceptionally better quality at the same size. If only I could contact BiA or GOTHiC and let them know how important they are to a few of us!
,ste05,2006-12-22T11:00Z,I wish you would put these shows in HD I notice the difference in a really big way both on my tv and computer...   Thanks heaps for supplying these.
