Evolution can only take place were a cell devides itself, thats science fact. 


Nothing comes from nothing, though some socalled scientists claim that absolutly nothing formed a superdense blackhole which then exploded and created everything. 


Furthermore they claim that a rock evolved into a single cell which in turn evolved into man. 


So the next time you see a statue in a markedplace and someone claims it has a creator, you now can laugh at them and say, off course not, this statue has evolved over millions of years, and guess what, it evolved from absolutly nothing :) "

Who created God? Let me guess, he's eternal? Well I say the Universe is eternal. "

first of all, you're full of shit:

""Nothing comes from nothing, though some socalled scientists claim that absolutly nothing formed a superdense blackhole which then exploded and created everything.""

Science does not say that something came from nothing. Where did you read that? Got any links?

""Furthermore they claim that a rock evolved into a single cell which in turn evolved into man. ""

You have no idea what you are talking about. A rock turning into a cell? Please, show me where you read that.
But please, read up on evolution and common ancestry. You clearly got it wrong."
