MATLAB is a high-level language and interactive environment that enables
you to perform computationally intensive tasks faster than with traditional programming languages such as C, C++, and Fortran.



R2006b, released on September 1, 2006, includes updates to MATLAB and Simulink, six new products released since R2006a, and updates and bug fixes to 80 other products. Subscribers to Software Maintenance Service can download R2006b product updates.
