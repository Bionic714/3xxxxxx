,david_1234321,2007-03-01T02:00Z,I hope this version runs double threads for dual core. I'm pretty sure you get an extra 2 GB addressable ram with x64 and this version. I dont think the previous versions run more than 2GB and I know they are single threaded so if you have 2 core its only using half processor.
