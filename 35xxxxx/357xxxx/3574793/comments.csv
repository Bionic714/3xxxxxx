,oleanhardrock21,2008-01-12T16:57Z,"Good info on steps to create fire.  Lavalle is a horribly boring teacher who does a LOT of pushing for his stecils.  He wastes tons of time by cutting out all his stencils in the video, come on!
Thanks for all the videos Bunje!  "
,oleanhardrock21,2008-01-12T18:03Z,"PS, the whole video is one big long boring advertisement for Lavallees stencils.  Every 30 seconds he pushes them on you, wasting valuable time he could be using to teach you something.
People, get the free video here and check out his stencils.  Go to ebay or office depot and get transparency film for the overhead projector (thin, clear, plastic stuff).  Draw out some curves using Lavallee's video as reference.  Cut them out and you have true fire for .03 cents and not an arm and a leg.  Well, you will have true fire after 100's of hours of practice.  These pro's make it look easy.  They also want you to believe that when you buy their stencils you will be doing what they do in no time.  Not true!  Make your own stencils and practice, practice, practice!  When you still can't do it, contact me and i'll buy your airbrush, lol."

,jmkitten,2009-07-12T23:25Z,"This is not the actual True Fire video;  This video comes with Mike Levallee's  True Fire stencil set.  Interesting to watch, but not much useful information"
