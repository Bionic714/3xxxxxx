  |  "With the Christmas With My Friends concert recording a long-time     |
  |  dream come true for me. I have always wanted to preform these songs   |
  |  of joy, but in my own way and with good friends as company, being     |
  |  able to concentrate on the music without any boundaries.              |
  |      It is with great pride and happiness that I am presenting this    |
  |  christmas concert to you. It is the Christmas I dremed of as a kid    |
  |  an I kept on dreaming till I got the chance to fulfil it and now      |
  |  it's here, right infront of me and you.                               |
  |                                                                        |
  |  What we've got is a wonderful mix of songs from medieval Europe to    |
  |  modern Christmas songs from the American tradition, something that I  |
  |  always wanted to do, at least as long as I have been in the business  |
  |  wich counts 30 years today.                                           |
  |      My friends on this recodring are simple the best ones I could     |
  |  wish for as Christmas gift. Viktoria Tolstoy, Sharon Dyall, Jeanette  |
  |  Kohn, Johan Norberg, Ulf Wakenius, jonas Knutsson, Lars Dainelsson    |
  |  and Bugge Wesseltoft, they all go way back.                           |

  |  Ida Sandlund is my newest friend, a truly wonderful performer from    |
  |  whom you will hear more and soon!                                     |
