,ranchobluedog,2006-12-07T03:01Z,Is this newest version 2.3? It would be very nice if it was...
,TheHitcher,2006-12-07T14:13Z,Does this need an activation code?
,sundazed,2006-12-07T22:57Z,"I think this is the version of CS2 that was around about a year ago (all the files are the same size). If that's the case you don't need to activate it, it works off the included serial numbers."
,nottheold,2006-12-10T08:49Z,hey bluewater - great upload!! cud you tell me if it has acrobat 8 or 7 on it!! thanks again!!
,promix01,2006-12-11T11:32Z,seeda!!
,gemigene,2006-12-14T03:59Z,"Wonderful, 1 seeder at 1.4 Kbs, thought that Mac owners were special people (a world apart from the Windoze group). 14 days to download something which I'm not sure if it works or not isn't worth it.

Thanks anyways..."
,john101,2006-12-15T03:51Z,CD6 is corrupt and will not mount.
,Gheten,2006-12-24T19:45Z,Please seed guys!
,wurstfinger,2006-12-28T09:51Z,"No, CD6 is not really corrupt - you need to mount it with Toast, though."
,wurstfinger,2006-12-28T10:12Z,"To answer the other questions:
* ""Adobe Acrobat 7.0 Professional"" is included
* The installed version of Photoshop is 9.0x196"
,wurstfinger,2006-12-28T11:02Z,"I just now installed all apps and then did an online update. Appears that the included serial number is not yet blacklisted: update went well and the apps still launch.

So, I guess it's safe to apply the online update after installation."
,kelvinlao,2007-01-05T06:32Z,"No, CD6 _is_ damaged.  It won't work with hdiutil, dmg2iso.exe, or Version 6 of Titanium Toast.
:k:"
,kaputt,2007-01-22T16:43Z,what language?
,goobergrape,2007-02-28T07:14Z,"could someone please seed for this impatient girl?
thanks."
,goobergrape,2007-03-01T09:30Z,"when Norton was running scans on the disks, it says that many files were damaged.  i don't know if this is going to afffect the installation or not.  i'm about to find out!"
,goobergrape,2007-03-01T09:32Z,"the damaged files were on disk 5.  and disk 6 is unreadable/didn't mount.   

any suggestions?"
,1984isnow,2007-03-30T08:46Z,"CS2  WILL  run on a duo core intel processor.  Here is how to do it... update your computer, more specifically quicktime.  chances are you have 7.1.1, you need to update.  I had 7.1.2 and it still would not install, I updated everything, now I'm compositing and vector drawing myself into an anxiety attack. check this out:
