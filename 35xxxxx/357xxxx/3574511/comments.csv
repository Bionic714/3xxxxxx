We did, both the Mac and PC versions are at demonoid. : )"
,!Share,2006-12-26T21:47Z,"The system wouldn't let me put the address for demonoid. It's demonoid dot com (LOL), do a poser search, and voila!"
,!Share,2007-01-03T00:12Z,"LordBalthazar, I forgot all about the invite-only thing. I just noticed for the first time that demonoid says registrations are open every friday, GMT. lol

Well, I'm sending you an invite code now. :D"
,narfos,2007-01-04T12:11Z,"how can one register at demonoid?

,fanous,2007-01-06T15:46Z,"Hi , how I can download this file !? what is the ivention code !? dose anyone send it to me !?"
,narfos,2007-01-06T20:30Z,"one don't have to have a invitation code to download this file.
just press the ""DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT""
to download the torrent.
then use a programm like bitorrent to download the file using the torrent file."
,AiFiLTr0,2007-01-21T12:29Z,"!Share, can you send me an inv code as well. I'm trying to get regged on demonoid for already over a month with no luck =(. Thanks"
,red107,2007-01-26T16:48Z,"Hi !Share,

Could you or anyone else reading this please pm me an invite code for demonoid. I've been trying to get one for the longest time.  Thank you
"
,!Share,2007-01-27T02:29Z,"Hey, peeps. I got your PMs, but since I don't visit the Pirate Bay every day, I got them only today. Just to let you know that Demonoid is OPEN for registrations this very day (Friday).

To narfos, AiFiLTr0, & red107, if you get my PMs and/or this note after Friday, I will definitely make those invites for you. I'm trying it this way first since demonoid is open today, and if you get in, I will have generated codes unnecessarily."
