,abjectblitz,2007-07-01T00:26Z,The English subtitles better be there along with German audio.
,abjectblitz,2007-07-19T17:34Z,"I can confirm there is German audio and English subtitles. Thanks great movie, if anyone finds the version with English dubbing which was actually very good with accents give me a shout. Lost my DVD ages ago and cant find it in shops any more."
,matteglans,2009-06-05T01:32Z,"This is one of my best movies i´ve seen cause it doesnt really show anyone as ""evil"" people. It shows the true face of war, since in war, there is no honour there is no glory there are only victims and victims who are forced to do evil things. WAR IS THE EVIL!!!  An old film but a film i truely loved and really affected me and i´ve seen the movie an x nmber of times
WATCH IT,, there is no american proganda in this film as there are in most holywood movies,,,, 
THIS IS REALITY"
