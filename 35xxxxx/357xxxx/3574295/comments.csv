,penol738,2006-12-10T16:32Z,"if this is a DEVIANCE release, why is it not named properly, and not split into archives?

Smells like a fake"
,ode55,2006-12-10T16:59Z,Anyone downloaded this shit? Fake?
,penol738,2006-12-10T19:09Z,"I hate rars as much as the next guy (or gal), but when a very new product (not even officially released) comes out with a non-standard name and not packed into archives, I tend to get a little bit suspicious. The game is released on Tuesday, and it usually takes a few days for the rls groups to work out a crack"
,penol738,2006-12-10T19:15Z,"I'm not saying that it is a fake, I just wanna hear some confirmation that it's real"
,Sarre,2006-12-10T19:28Z,"Not on nforce, so probably fake."
,minapengar,2006-12-10T20:22Z,this is so funny! why do ppl put up various fakes and call them deviance etc? What drives these ppl? i dont get it
,mathiash,2006-12-11T15:53Z,"No.. Is RianbowSix like Splinter Cell, Only supports Shader 3.0 ? : /"
,Tompa__,2006-12-11T16:28Z,"This is a fake, this is Rainbow Six: Lockdown.
(I just installed it)."
,Spasmus,2006-12-11T17:34Z,I can confirm that this is Rainbor six lockdown... Just downloaded it
,goodtoshare,2006-12-11T23:04Z,"This is a fake, but one where they've gone really out of their way to fool people. It's got the right splash screen, readme's and all that jazz, but the actual game is Rainbow Six: Lockdown. Also don't try to play the game, it'll install starforce.

This is a waste of time people, avoid it and someone please punch the uploader."
