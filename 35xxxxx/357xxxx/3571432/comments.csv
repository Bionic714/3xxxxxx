[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-06T00:07Z,"yeah thanks ^^
Tried to seed in initial seeding but uTorrent messed it up. just seeding normally and we'll see how it goes"
,ArkhamAsylum,2006-12-06T07:00Z,"rar is good, don't listen to the newbies :)  Thanks for sharing!"
,Superflow,2006-12-06T14:54Z,"Yeah, 720P!!! Awesome man :)"
,Superflow,2006-12-06T18:20Z,I´ve watched this and the previous 720P episode on my P4 3.0 GHz in VLC 0.8.5 now and I´m sorry to say both episodes freeze randomly. It´s *very* annoying. Is my computer too slow or the videos just badly encoded?
[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-06T19:58Z,they work on my Celeron 1.6 Ghz 512MB RAM with integrated intel graphics so i guess you have something corrupt in your codec register. Use FFDshow and media player classic (K-Lite Codec Pack Standard or Full) instead of stupid VLC
,Impulse8006,2006-12-07T14:20Z,"Ive got a amd 64 3200+ 1 gb ,6600gt gfx, and it works perfect in wmp, the picture on my 42"" plasma is so nice. Thanks again teddy ;) "
[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-07T17:32Z,"hehe Impulse8006, good computer, bigscreen TV and 2* 100mbit connection. Luxury ;)"
,fl0,2006-12-07T21:49Z,"thx man,
can't wait to watch this one..."
,Jibber1986,2006-12-08T16:54Z,720p is great! Would awsome if every episode in season 2 was uploaded in HD.
,Superflow,2006-12-11T20:23Z,"VLC 0.8.6 was released today and finally I can watch this without the choppy playback!! Version 0.8.5 was dropping hundreds of frames but this version only dropped 17 in 38 minutes, and that´s acceptable."

it says it using AVC/h.264 by far the best encoder/size ratio there is so just get yourself a copy of CoreAVC codec and be able to watch just anything on your setup.

corAVC is by far the best/fastest encoder and even beats many of the gfx card
hardware decoders to date.

Mpeg4 AVC IS FAR BETTER than xvid/divX as it has a lossless mode that mpeg4ASP does not, everyone should be useing it.

btw what bitrate was it encoded at, its always useful to know that.

to keep it simple to re-encode to AVC just use mencoder264
