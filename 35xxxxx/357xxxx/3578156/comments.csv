I spent tens and even hundred of hours editing the movie. and I've switched from mpeg-1 now to 640x480 in the website. plus, it's free. perhaps if you are willing to pay, I can make a DVD for you =)

since it's free, I think it's fair that all I ask for is to go to my website to watch it.

thanks for the comment btw."

I will visit your website, but I hope you will share the rest of the ""videogame movie"" in high quality mpeg2 files later on ;)

Thank you!"

I'm sure people like Axxo wouldnt be respected as much if they only put their movie rips on a website demanding people to watch it on a tiny screen, its because he gives people freedom to download what gives him the respect.. 
Look at him now, everyone knows him...
But who am i to say this, its your work so its your choice how you want people to respect you.."
