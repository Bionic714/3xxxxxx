By 1943 the tide of the war had finally started to flow in favour of the Allied forces. As the industrial might and great cities of Germany began to suffer under the constant aerial bombardments, Hitler promised a devastating revenge. 'Vengeance weapons' were developed and deployed and were soon causing indiscriminate damage to cities such as London and Antwerp. Although deployment of V1 and V2 rockets signalled the death throws of the crumbling Third Reich, given more time they could have completely changed the outcome of the war. The detailed analysis and stunning computer graphics within this programme clearly describe the fascinating story of the 'Doodlebugs'. Narrated by Graham McTavish.
