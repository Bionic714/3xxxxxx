,SnoopyII,2007-01-08T06:34Z,I finally got the whole thing. It is a recording from TV. Quality is probably 6.5 on a scale of 1 to 10 but it is a very rare movie. It converted to DVD flawlessly.
,tio00,2008-04-07T13:17Z,"Any chance of resseding this, plĂ¸ease?"
,BeOSDano0,2008-04-26T15:45Z,"I'll seed it again Starting April 26, 2008"
