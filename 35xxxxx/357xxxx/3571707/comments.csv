,Ceriasly,2011-08-16T20:04Z,"Here is the setlist, near as I can figure given the fact that the entire file is stuck at 98.5%.  Anyway, several of the tracks are more than one song, so it should be re-tracked.  Here is the setlist near as I can figure:

1) Phase Dance - Better Days Ahead (early version)
2) James - Offramp
3) ""It's For You"" 
4) The Bat --> Berimbau Solo --> Ozark --> Turnaround
5) As Falls Wichita, So Falls Wichita Falls
6) Jaco --> Drum Solo
7) Au Lait -->
8) Band Intros/Thanks --> Heartland (Cross The)
