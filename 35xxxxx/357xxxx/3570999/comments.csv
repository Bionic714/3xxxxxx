First of all: thanks for sharing the file.

I have been trying to download this torrent, however the speed of 1-3 Kb/s makes me almost cry. 
Does anyone has any sug. on how to speed it up? (I already use the Shareaza Accelerator)

King regards, 
Maggie"

,alison89,2008-06-19T00:52Z,Does anyone have the second part to this lecture? It seems a bit useless without it. All the tools he talks about to make the changes are in the 2nd part. Disappointing to say the least.
,lightman12,2008-06-20T10:14Z,alison89: while I did not include the second part it has a reason: the first part is sound science - the second part is pure business - and more importantly IMHO does NOT work (and I have tried a lot of techniques!!) - you are better off with simple NLP or just plain ol' meditation (watch your breath ...)
