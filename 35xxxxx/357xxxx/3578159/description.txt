Al Bielek - The Philadelphia Experiment and Montauk Survivor Accounts CDROM

Al Bielek has lead a life most would not choose to live.  While many would think that time travel, meeting aliens, and working on secret projects are exciting ventures, Al paid a big price for the privilege.

Because those who set the agenda wish to keep their activities secret, Al was robbed of his family, his memories, and ultimately, his identity.  They used advanced technologies to erase what was dear to him.

However, their technologies are not perfect.  Slowly, the memories came back.  Al started meeting others who had been through the same process.  Ultimately, a flood of memories returned.

On this CD, Al gives the most comprehensive account of his life ever recorded.  It will shock and disturb most people to learn what is really going on in this planet.  But Al has come to the conclusion that the truth needs to be published.

For over ten years, Al has been featured on Radio Talk Shows and as a speaker in many conferences.  His story has captivated the attention of tens of thousands of people worldwide.  

We decided to put this CD together because his story could not be adequately told in a 1 hour or even a 4 hour presentation.  Only through the combination of audio, video, text and pictures, can the viewer begin to get an understanding of these events.

Many will question why Al hasn't been silenced.  We deal with that subject during some of the audio interviews.  Perhaps, those who set the agenda are allowing brief glimpses of the truth to emerge.  Perhaps it is something much bigger.
