,jdkullmann,2008-05-12T23:18Z,"So I was torrenting this, got to 92%, my system crashed and now I can't get the torrent started again. It just sits at 92%. I see 16 seeders and 54 leechers. Can anyone suggest what might be happening. I have other torrents running just fine so my system, network, etc are all working ok. I have not seen this happen before. Thanks."
