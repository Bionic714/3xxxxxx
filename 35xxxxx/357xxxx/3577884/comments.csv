,Jartsa_,2006-12-16T15:48Z,Thank you. Works fine :)
,Cobra Kai,2006-12-16T16:45Z,Is this crack to the 1.1 patch?
,zexxia,2006-12-16T16:55Z,"Yes and no

It the Maxi Image

You use Deamon Tool to mount the file include
You use SDHide
You Start the game
You play the game
You write a comment here if is not working"
,mymomma,2006-12-16T17:00Z,First time I use maxi image... where do I get the mds file?
,Cobra Kai,2006-12-16T17:02Z,"""You use SDHide""
Whats that and how do i get it? "
,zexxia,2006-12-16T17:07Z,"The "".mds"" include in the .RAR
No ""polemic"" but Maxi or Mini Image can be named the "".mds"" 

We call this the Maxi Image because is include the Total Image or the Original CD (Without modification) 

The rar is very slow to unpack (unrar) for this reason 
495 KB > 3 921 760 KB 
For space allocation on disk
Then You Need SD4Hide to hide Deamon Tools
"
,Cobra Kai,2006-12-16T17:09Z,"Yeah but that didnt really help me, where do i find the SDHide "
,mymomma,2006-12-16T17:11Z,"make a simple web or torrent researh with sd4hide or safedisc 4 hider

ok but it seems to fail for me:
I mount the mdf directly updated to last patch use sd4hide than start it makes an error"
,Cobra Kai,2006-12-16T17:15Z,"Ah screw this!
I guess I will be forced to wait for the crack, thats the price you have to pay for beeing a noob."
,zexxia,2006-12-16T17:16Z,"Cobra Kai: 

To play a game with SafeDisk protection you need to have the original CD/DVD or a tool (Deamon Tool) to mount a copy (image) of this CD/DVD
Medieval 2 use SafeDisc 4.60.000, and this version 4.6x use a algorithm to detect any Tool to Mount a image without the original CD/DVD, This method is called blacklisting
This Tool can be found on thepiratebay with search tool, with Google or forum like GameCopyWorld

Is very simple to find
Try http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3422017/SD4hide"
,zexxia,2006-12-16T17:18Z,"mymomma:
""start it makes an error""

,Prodius,2006-12-19T00:38Z,Do I use the Orginal Exe or does the patch overwrite the cracked files I have previously dowbloaded?
,zexxia,2006-12-19T07:05Z,"You juste have to use the original .EXE comming with you'r original CD the first time you installed the game, or after the patch.

You don't need crack just read previous post"
,fragie,2006-12-30T03:07Z,"I have a problem with the file. I unpack, load image with newest Daemon Tools, run SD4Hide, Hide with SD4Hide, open folder (no autorun it seems) and try to run the two exe files. No matter which one i choose, it just opens a console window for about half a second and then disappears again. Nothing else happens. Any suggestions?"
