,FloaterGX,2007-11-04T17:51Z,"How someone that has downloaded this and wants to seed, will be able to notice your requests for seeding without having to view these comments?"
,FloaterGX,2007-11-04T18:02Z,"A few more questions:

I suppose i am able to seed, when i've downloaded all the file and it writes ""seeding"". Is that correct?
But if i have not downloaded the whole file, but e.g. the 92% of it, then still i seed? Even if i have its downloading to pause mode?

A last one: What's the point of upload and download limit? Why to the F.A.Q. it writes ""higher the upload limit, then better the download limit""?

Thanks! :)"
