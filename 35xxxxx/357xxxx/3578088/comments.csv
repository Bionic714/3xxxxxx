Thnx guy.."
,mad_flyer,2006-12-16T21:56Z,FUCK YEAH!
,pilatuspilot,2006-12-16T22:15Z,"Thanks so much for uploading & sharing this with us.

I always laugh whenever I see something published as though the boyz at Just Flight designed something, when there are a distributor. They make no bonez about giving themselves the glory, when in fact the glory should be to the actual designer (in the case AH).

Very much appreciated, PC."

Anyone having problems with textures inside VC?"
,Ace2007,2006-12-17T00:21Z,there is missing textures on the VC  please check and make sure you uploaded all the files
,pilatuspilot,2006-12-17T00:37Z,"Yep, I'm having missing VC textures problem, too.
Also, it seems a bunch of folk are taking & running. I'm showing only 2 more seeders, other than myself seeding this wonderful work of fs art."

Thankyou Gd Service"
,4X-AXG,2006-12-17T01:07Z,argh ok that doesn't work..how do I share a screenshot with you guys?
,4X-AXG,2006-12-17T01:14Z,"my apologies, I see it now..I have a feeling the ripper overlooked that JF/AH installs textures in the main texture folder as well..I'll get right on it"
,4X-AXG,2006-12-17T01:23Z,"argh okay, I figured it out..for some reason, every aircraft texture folder in the FS2004 rip is missing a lot of textures..the FSX rip is complete however. the easiest solution is to download the FSX rip, copy all the aircraft texture folders to the unpacked FS2004 rip, but for safety do not overwrite the existing files. all the missing files will be added. I just did that to one texture folder and now the VC looks exactly like the JF screenshots. my apologies once again!"
,havoc04,2006-12-17T01:50Z,Any word on those textures 4X-AXG??

Does anyone have the new JF Lancaster??"
,JF Employee,2006-12-17T11:32Z,"@pilatuspilot:

Just to let you know, Just Flight do not claim that we do all the hard work and fully endorse the acheivements of the developers.

However we do not just simply distribute other peoples work as you wrongly claim. We have a large development team, which work extremely hard in order to produce high quality products.

Im afraid you are a very ignorant person who obviously needs to get his facts straight

P.s. Im glad you guys are enjoying our product"
,mad_flyer,2006-12-17T12:06Z,@JF Employee: Ur happy that we are ripping ur partner's product? Funny seeing an employee here. I wonder if all the rest of the comapany's have peeps here.
,allen_x,2006-12-17T12:50Z,great job on recreating the moth
,JF Employee,2006-12-17T17:44Z,"@Mad_flyer:

Yes, most companies check these sites. Remember that all i need to do to get your IPs is start downloading this torrent and use the options common in all torrent programs to view the IPs im receiving data from ;-)

Then we just use IP tracing services, which are also common on the internet.

And no we are not happy about people pirating programs but by downloading them from large sites like these, it just makes it easier to track you :)"
,B744,2006-12-17T18:46Z,you heard it first guys JF use P2P
,B744,2006-12-17T18:47Z,best be carefull someone doesnt report you guys aswell ;) 
,mad_flyer,2006-12-18T09:58Z,"@JF Employee:
Well, I download from here to try the product. If I like it, I will purchase it. If not, I just throw it out. That's always been my philosofy."
,surfer22,2006-12-23T07:34Z,"having texture problems here at the VC, 4X-AXG I downloaded the trial/demo version of this bird, check out the textures here and some are missing indeed. I'll try putting some textures from the demo version to the main texture folder. I think that the 30 day time limmit would'nt work on the the texture.BMP's =)"
,Readyed,2007-02-21T15:52Z,4X-AXG  You are a Lying name calling fucking jag off. You are a fucking Dolt and a fucking asshole. So go fuck yourself!! you want something then back out with your end FUCK YOU
