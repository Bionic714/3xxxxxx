,Commiesan,2008-01-17T18:16Z,"Hi!

I'll post this on all three toorents, so hopefully someone will notice it! ;)

I Cannot get the game to work either. I Downloaded ""1/2"" & ""2/2"" and installed the game. I tried to start a new game. The game opend and i Could create a player, but then it told me to insert cd1. I tried with the ""1/2"" .dmg, but that did not help. Then i Downloaded the ""(MAC) Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy updates, extra maps, no-cd key,"", Patched the game, and extracted the Nocd.toast.sitx and clicked on the Nocd.toast. The cd-image appeared in Devices, but now i could not even open the game, it asks for cd1 immideatly. When people say i shall burn it to a cd, do they mean i shall burn the ""1/2.dmg"" or the ""Nocd.toast""?

Plz help! //Commiesan"

This has the NO_CD and updates. Install the updates-1.0.1b and 1.0.1c, then make a copy TO A REAL CD the NO_CD (I used toast, but you can use disk utility)

Verify then mount...

,VileCore,2008-05-09T13:52Z,"Why is it that NO-ONE seems to know what to do with mac games? If it's a disc image, burn it to cd/dvd. Are people really so fucking dense? Why buy a computer that youdon't know how to fucking use? Every file on this site has ""help I don't know how to make it work"" comments. Jesus, children, LEARN about the expensive hardware your mommies bought you."
,VileCore,2008-05-09T13:52Z,"And fant0men, I could be wrong, but uploading them seperately makes it easier to upload and download. 2 smaller files will download faster than one long one...but maybe thats just me, I dunno."
,caine3320,2008-06-08T20:27Z,"See, VileCore, here's my problem (and you can berate me all you want, but that does nothing other than make you look like an elitist ass): having used Windows PCs all my life until recently, using OSX is proving a bit of a challenge. When a Mac newbie like me encounters people like you who brush them off and call them ""children"" for not knowing every line of code on their drive, it's enough to make them want to scrap the hardware and give up. 

And when people give such general instructions as, ""mount the image, install the game, patch the game, and play!"" it helps no one except the people who already know what they're doing. That being said . . . 

I ran the installer after mounting both images, and all that got put in my Apps folder was a folder containing 3 .pk3 files and some plug-ins. No app. Kinda hard to patch an app that doesn't exist, wouldn't you say? I got no error messages, and was prompted to register my software, but I have not been able to run the software. I tried burning the toast files to two cds, and repeated the install process, with the same results. Any suggestions? "
,zanderohm,2008-06-18T21:20Z,"Hey VileCore, grow some manners, boy! Jeeeez...

caine... didja open up all of the files in the extras package, meaning double click on them... in there you will find the updates plus the ""Jedi Academy - No CD.toast"" file... 

somethings up with the 1.01c update for me, it locks up in the installing mode and fries my copy of Jedi... so i haven't gotten past updating yet... arrgghhh"
,zanderohm,2008-06-18T21:23Z,"also...
i've been on a mac since the IIsi, and only recently started going thru the toast, patch and mounting thing, so i don't know what a lot of this stuff is as well but i'm learning... 
and no, my mommy didn't buy me my first computer... daddy did!"
,vibeke71,2008-06-22T21:23Z,"Ive tried the following 3 methods after reading instructions fully and checking the forums here and then installing the 2 toast jkJA images.

1. Just mounting the no_cd toast file and running the game.
2. Burning the no_cd toast file onto a cd and then try to run the game.
3. Opened the no_cd toast file and burned the contents therein (base folder etc) as well as the no_cd toast file onto a seperate cd and the tried to run the game.

Hasn't worked yet. Still asks for me to insert disk 1."
,zanderohm,2008-06-28T04:43Z,"Ditto here, vibeke71...
oh well, hopefully someone will be able to fix it and seed a new one, if not, doesn't look like Jedi will be in my play book..."
,jpfontenelle,2008-07-15T01:50Z,"alright... I've downloaded the two parts, I've burned them with Toast 9 Titanium, and I've installed it on my Macbook. Then I've downloaded the patch for intel based macs, and it did not work! when I try to start the game, it only starts to make strange sounds and the game doesnt even start. Then I tried that other torrent pack with the no-cd image. I've patched with the patches which come together and used the no-cd image, mounted with Toast, and it has also not worked, with the same sounds and stuff.

What am I doing wrong? 
Can anyone give me a hand?
thanks a lot!!"
,motherofbermuda,2008-07-27T01:15Z,"On the first scene before the big gate after beating the lizards, the game crashes to the desktop.

,jmnikricket,2008-09-09T23:26Z,"For those who need a step-by-step guide to use the no cd file (http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3571053) and don't have Toast, here it is:

1) Download torrent file
2) Use torrent client to download ""JKJA Extras.sitx"" file
3) Double click the file; it should automatically unarchive (.sitx is a type of compression similar to .zip) with Stuffit Expander or similar decompressing software. If not, right-click the file and select ""Open with..."" and select ""Stuffit Expander"". If it is not an option, select ""Other"" and find the StuffIt Expander application (usually in /Applications or /Applications/Utilities). If you don't have StuffIt Expander, it is available as a free download; do a search.
4) The unarchived folder ""JKJA Extras"" should be in the same directory (folder) as the original downloaded file. Find the file ""Jedi Academy - No CD.toast.sitx"" and double-click to unarchive or use steps from (3).
5) Now you should see the file ""Jedi Academy - No CD.toast"" in your ""JKJA Extras"" folder. Copy this file to your desktop for more convenient burning if you'd like.
6) Insert a blank CD-R. You might get a prompt asking what you want to do with the CD. Just choose ""Open Finder"" if you do.
7) Open the application ""Disk Utility"" in your /Applications/Utilities/ directory.
8) Click the ""Burn"" icon at the top toolbar in the Disk Utility application.
9) Select the ""Jedi Academy - No CD.toast"" file from your Desktop (if you didn't move the file to your desktop you will have to navigate through your download files; mine was at /Documents/Azureus Downloads/JKJA Extras/JediAcademy - No CD.toast)
10) An options screen pops up. The defaults should be good. Click ""Burn"" and wait for it to verify and finish burning.
11) Insert the CD whenever you want to play the game.

This is how I did it using Leopard on an Intel mac. Hope this helps you guys out. Note that you must burn the CD; simply mounting the .toast file by double-clicking it will not be recognized by the game. "
,kiddojono,2009-01-26T10:44Z,"um the toast file is unreadable by toast. but it sez to continue with cd burning if ur sure it is a valid toast file. any help? should i just burn it and see wat happens. one last thing when i right clicked there was a selection that sed ""Mount it"" (right under ""Toast it"") i clicked mount it and a cd image came up called to the end of the earth, and in it was a music file called to the ends of the earth, wtf?"
,yvorwinters,2009-02-19T20:08Z,"Did anyone solve the feedback noise problem?  When I run the ""no-CD"" disk, it loads a picture of the game's box but the only clickable things are a folder of ""base"" and the readme file.  By the way, anyone get this to work on a intel mac with Leopard?"
,yvorwinters,2009-02-19T20:21Z,"Oops - apparently jmnikricket got it working on a intel mac w/ Leopard ... Anyway, I still have the issue that after putting in the ""No-CD"" disk there doesn't seem to be a way to actually play the game."
,yvorwinters,2009-02-19T22:48Z,"So I got this to work on my intel macbook with leopard.  First I installed from the two toast images, which Leopard read without needing an actual copy of Toast.  Then I got the weird buzzing sound.  The way to bypass that is to get an autoexec.cfg file like this one: http://redsaurus.net/autoexec.cfg

Then put it in the ""base"" folder of the Jedi Academy folder.  You might need to use Text Wrangler to get the autoexec.cfg file to work right - i.e. if you use autoexec.cfg and nothing happens, use Text Wrangler to open it and then save it using Text Wrangler as autoexec.cfg.  

Finally it should run.  I've barely played it and once it crashed to desktop but it seems more or less workable."

,ssbdk,2010-09-01T21:11Z,"so basically - i did all the instructions as from the last comment. I am not a noob. i've done cracks etc 100 of times.. but this one won't work.. first of all:
the crack provided - doestn work.. say app had to quit unexpected. i fixed that by copying & replacing the iPatcher file in : ""Jedi Academy MP v9467 NoCD Patch"" (show package) /contents/MacOs/ 
with the iPatcher file from the iPatch program (show package) /Contents/Reseources/iPatcher (Show package again)/Contents/MacOs and voila..

now the crack.app works (same for MP)
now... i apply the crack on the patched (b through e) JA file. and the crack asks me this: ""iPatch need to change permissions for these files : MacOS
Jedi Academy""

I agree to change permissions and... i get this: ""Error /Applications/Jedi Academy/Jedi Academy.app/Contents/MacOS
/Applications/Jedi Academy/Jedi Academy.app/Contents/MacOS/Jedi Academy ""

,scoutxr28,2011-04-10T08:21Z,"Hi Guys, I figured out how to get the game to work without even burning the CD!

Unfortunatly the only solution appears to be a paid one, but if someone can crack that then were good, but for DEMO purposes you can try this and it WILL work!

Do a search on google for Virtual CD-RW, it's a program for mac that emulates the drives much like DEAMON tools for Windows.  Jedi Academy's security merely looks to see that the title Jedi Academy Disc 1 is within a valid optical drive, that is why mounting the disc image won't work, or even mounting with toast!

This program does work though, I've tested it!

What you do is tell it to make a new media after you install it.  Using the No-CD.dmg etc, just copy the files from that into the the (fake) blank cd it created for you on your desktop.  Click 'Burn' so it makes it an actual CD as far as your computer is concerned.

Load up Jedi Academy and it works! If you guys need help getting it working you can email me at scoutxr28@yahoo.com, I'll help."
,yvorwinters,2011-04-14T16:22Z,"Nukilis - Try: http://redsaurus.net/00/node/9

When you download the autoexec.cfg file you might need ""textwrangler"" to get the .txt ending off.  Then just paste the file into the ""base"" folder.  It works for Jedi Knight II Jedi Outcast too.  Sorry it has been over a year since you asked."
