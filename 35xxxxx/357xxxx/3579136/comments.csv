,juancho1980,2008-09-16T00:03Z,"The format daa, may be to converting from UltraISO 9.3 Premium Version.

Start UltraISO 9.3+ Premium > Tools > Convert

Open dialog for Original file from format DAA from origin folder

Open dialog or especify these file are a destination folder

Select any formats to destinate for destination file format are: NRG, ISO, Alcohol, Cue, BIN, etc.

A UltraISO and PowerISO applications can be resolved converting into NRG or ISO Format.

,montypi,2009-02-21T14:14Z,"tsk tsk....... So many n00bs.

I already own IL2: Forgotten Battles, so I can't say if it works or not. The Ace expansion pack works 100%, though it'd be nice to have an iso instead of the bin and cue files. I'm a fan of iso's :-P

Currently downloading Pacific Fighters, will tell the doubters if it works or not.

Absolutely excellent torrent. Works just like it should. Would recommend it to anyone who likes these types of games."

,DaNoob,2009-04-24T16:18Z,What do i install first? I am not a noob at installing games with daemon tools and stuff but idk what fodler is the first stand alone game. could someone tell me what part to install first?
,DaNoob,2009-04-24T20:01Z,NVM i found out how to install this. Daemon tools dident know what the daa files were so i got power iso and everything is great.
,DaNoob,2009-04-24T22:15Z,ok i installed the game/first expansion/second expansion/patched with the right patch from ubisofts website and then cracked it from gamecopyworld. When i run it everything starts out fine but i get an application error... something about memory.

,mickeyagrawal2001,2009-08-31T00:16Z,"http://www.techzilo.com/extract-open-daa-files-free/

open this site for people who have problem regarding .daa files"
,SJCarline,2009-10-19T20:42Z,"I dont understand why people like .daa files so much. They take FOREVER to extract the original files inside and theres only a few programs to open them. Its a pain, but if your already down loading this why not snag poweriso as well it will open the .daa files or allow you to mount them as well."
,Zenit33,2010-01-01T08:43Z,"Install in this order:
1) Forgotten Battles
2) Ace Expansion
3) Pacific Fighters
4) Patches (in order)

This is the culmination of all IL-2 (you can download the original if you're a collector) until 1946 came out in 2006/7 which brought together Operation Barbarossa & PE2 expansions, with 1946 (ecret Weapons of the Luftwaffe).

The patches have ""m"" in them (ex: 403m.rar) so it is for the merged install of Pacific Fighters (PF+FB+AEP). If you install stand-alone Pacific Fighters download the patches here: http://forums.ubi.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/23110283/m/4721047273

Which is better than update page at the aging official site: http://il2-sturmovik.de.ubi.com/en/updates.php


Installation *Instructions* for N00Bs:
=======================

-Go to http://www.techzilo.com/extract-open-daa-files-free/ for link to download 'daa2iso'. 
-Convert FB1.daa & Fb2.daa to iso's
Option A:
-Burn the 2 iso's to 2 CD's using Nero or anything that works.

Option B:
Use 7Zip (or Winrar/Winzip) to extract the iso files into 2 DIFFERENT folders and try to install like that, 

Option C: (much easier)
-Use Daemon Tools (free download on official site, Pro Tools is trial only though) to mount on virtual CD drive. Go to My Computer after that, click on the virtual drive (probably D: or E:), and run setup there to install. When Install asks you for CD 2, go to Daemon tools & unmount 1st Iso, mount #2 and continue install. 

When done do Ace expansion.
1) Extract dev-i2fa.rar using 7Zip or Winrar. 
2) Mount dev-i2fa.cue using Daemon Tools, go to virtual drive and install. Or burn to a CD using Nero, Alcohol 120%, or anything else (selecting the cue file perferably, not direcly the bin or sound files might be screwed up), and install with that cd.

With Pacific Fighters, you should know what to do by now, except understand that MDF image files (which come from Alcohol 120%) use MDS files the same way Cue is used for Bin image files.

Each of these 3 games has cd-protection which will not let you start the game. You don't need to mount cd every time to play, simply replace 1 .dll file for each (or just it once for Pacific Fighters if you're going to install all of them)

The PF dll file is found when you extract rld-pacf.rar and get the Disk1/2 MDF/MDS files. You'll see Reloaded file (not sure what it is yet) & rts.dll. Go to where you installed PF (C:\Program Files\Ubi Soft\IL-2 Sturmovik Forgotten Battles) and copy the cracked rts.dll (104kb) over the old one (1.24mb). The game will start now

For Forgotten Battles it is found in \FB2\Crack (the 2nd install disk) which came from FB2.daa/FB2.iso

For Ace Expansion it is found in \deviance folder in the root of dev-i2fa.bin (once you mount, burn or extract it)


For the future, if there are any images without a ""cue"" partner (readable with notepad), make your own or download a cue maker that analyzes the image and instantly makes a cue file to direct the burning program. 

Support this great game & genre!! 
Get your friends to play online. 

After you try this you MAY realize IL-2 1946 is the best way to go until Maddox's sequel (with new engine) Storm of War: Battle of Britain
comes out sometime in 2010. It's only $5-10 now in stores, Ubi or Steampowered.com"
,Zenit33,2010-01-05T01:01Z,"IL-2 survives online with HyperLobby (under the Forgotten Battles server, IL2 & Pacific Fighters servers are normally empty). And most play IL-2 1946 v4.09 (latest patch), a few play v4.08 and plenty also play the HSFX mod (for 1946).

FB+AEP+PF can be combined with 46 but for the average person it is a waste of time, go get the 1946 DVD or buy from steam for $5, it includes all previous IL-2 and only requires the application of 1 or 2 patches (to change from 4.07) to be playing online.
