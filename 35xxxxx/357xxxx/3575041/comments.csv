 Hey men !!

 I donÂ´t know wich kind of internet conexion you have, but I only have 80 kbs of upload.
 So I will need 30 hours to upload full movie, the full 7.8 Gb.

 If you are desesperated with muy upload speed, I may sugest you to wait till tomorrow to start your donwload. Or try Pando program.

 And second... would be nice to read some thanks too from you, cause upload DVDs isnÂ´t my job.
 I upload back-ups, cause I love to share and build a great P2P comunity.

 So be patient, relax and soon you will have your movie."
,Dominic Toretto,2006-12-12T00:57Z,Ok. understand! But i think you can write that in the fact next time you upload a torrent! :)
,panpa,2006-12-12T20:36Z,"I think my uploads are enough clear.
You can compare my upload ""info"" with the rest public DVD uploads, and you will see.

,Fullrate,2006-12-14T01:11Z,"Thanks for this upload, I know my kids would love to watch it again.

And to those of you that complain about upload speed - Maybe you rather he did'nt upload it at all ? That way you can spend your hard earned money, and go buy it instead.

Keep up the good work panpa - some of us are happy with the upload rate.
