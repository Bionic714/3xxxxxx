Last change to the rest of text: 2006-12-14

Check the date above, if not changed, don't read 
the rest because it was not changed since the last time.

Please, seed 1:1 or max. 72hrs because I can't do that 
alone. Someone else let you have the file, so just give
back.

You can upload the .TORRENT on other publics/privates tracker
More trackers = more seeders/leechers = more speed overall :D
I don't know all of them ;) But keep all the files and 
use the .TXT for description.

If your are stuck because no one is seeding, just 
leave a comment in the last episode that was uploaded.
Me or someone else will help you finish it. But go to 
the original tracker.

Thank's

Contest rules + video(how to) here: 
http://www.i2mfan.com/contest.htm

P.S. I'm no longer associated with the site(my choice).
But I don't have to pay the bills now. 

I started seeding episode 15 before I knew of it. :(

******************************************************
Some asked me to include a "How to create a .MIS from 
tv.com". So, I created a small video(1m30s) with 
notes, chapters... I rared it because it took 331KB 
vs 8.06MB. It's on i2mfan.com site also. I submited it.

******************************************************
If you download a free file anywhere(database/software)
remember to click on the ads. They do appreciated it. 
It pays for the bandwidth/site! :D

******************************************************
So, what is a .MIS(my own definition)? 

A .MIS is a metadata text file(title, description, 
credit, goofs, chapters...) file formatted to help 
in the organization of all the movies/tv shows/podcast ...
you got in folders. It replace the .NFO.

It's formated so that players (software and consumer 
electronics) can use that information(metadata) and
display it on the screen.

The .TXT was made from the .MIS text file as the source. 
I only created it to post on sites. Otherwise, I don't 
use it.

******************************************************

INFO 2 MIS v2.0.0B7 is free. It's the app's that I 
used to create the .MIS. It can also extract
information from imdb.com(with picture), tv.com, 
amazon.com(with picture), dvdempire.com (with picture) ....

Took me a second with an episode on tv.com and
a few more for a movies on imdb.com

VideoRedo(not free) is the best for editing MPEG files.
It's fast and easy and worth the money. I can remove
commercials or cut an MPG2 with ease. :D
