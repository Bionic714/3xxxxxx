,JiggaShaolin,2006-12-14T13:14Z,ty..anybody tried? does it work?
,Dennisisthlm,2006-12-14T20:54Z,Yes it worked. I have played all day. It works like a charm;)
,Huntak,2006-12-15T08:01Z,Do i need an emulator for this or what? I dowloaded it and now i dont know what to do!
,elyk1212,2006-12-15T21:47Z,"Hey, CRC are typically I/O errors with media, but they can also be a check with network packets.  Typically this means it only throws out a few packets and retransmits on failures to the check, as far as I recall.   Where did you get that error?  Did you know you can check the MD5 sum to see if the image is correct?  You may have a good working image, that failed in some writing sequence, or damaged media.  Thought that may save time to know...."
,NcT,2006-12-16T18:01Z,"doesn´t work, I burned it with clonecd at 2x and I get a dre just after the nintendo logo.."
,Huntak,2006-12-16T18:48Z,wait so you actually play it on the gc?
,nejked,2006-12-18T06:33Z,i don't have the best chip on my gamecube but.. in the beginning all burned games started 1 time i started them but now zelda took 40 minutes to start ... could it be like the laser or something that need changing?
,alatusa,2006-12-19T15:29Z,after u downloaded please keep seed.... to make the speed faster =)
,Lasha89,2006-12-20T10:17Z,Can I download this and play it on the computer if I've got an emulator for gc? Or do I have to get a gamecube for this?
,terabyte88,2006-12-21T00:27Z,"I downloaded this a couple days ago and am looking for the Mini dvd-Rs you need. I would like to know though, if its possible to play this on wii without a modchip or does it have to be played on the GC"
,Mjeh,2006-12-26T16:45Z,Can you run this on the computer? and so yes how:p?
,KoFF02,2006-12-27T10:02Z,"Dont Work on my cube
any or your releases...

,Sig357,2006-12-28T05:09Z,"DOESN'T WORK!!!

i'm using the Viper GC Extreme with laser mod.

i very rarely have DRE's and can tell u, w/o a doubt, this image is a POS.



hey rudeeez,

TEST YOUR SHIT B4 RELEASING IT - THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME."
,elyk1212,2007-01-01T20:52Z,"""Got the CRC error when i tried to UnRar the file. get the same error message when i try to put the files in another folder.

Lately i have got many CRC error messages.. dont know if it is my harddrive who is fucked or what.""

Try a different archive program, maybe winrar?  I am using  Mandriva linux with a free GNU unrar program and it works great. 
"
,elyk1212,2007-01-01T20:52Z,"
BTW,
-------------------------------------------------------------
This game works great, I have tested it on:
-------------------------------------------------------------
Chip: DuoQ  (laser mod)
Laser impedance: 190 ohms
GameCube Model: DOL-001
Disc Media: Ritek Ridata 
Disc Media Code: RITEKG05
Burned using: growisofs Linux (with K3B GUI)
-------------------------------------------------------------

If it it not working for you, something is wrong on your end.   I suggest trying the mentioned media, and please list your chip.  

Stating it does not work, and you have no chip... well, you can guess what the problem would be ;)"
,elyk1212,2007-01-01T20:59Z,"BTW, no you cannot run it on a Wii, as there is no mod for this system (not yet, anyway).  You can only run it on a Gamecube.  

It will not run on your computer! LOL
Possible Exception?: There might be an emulator for Gamecube, but most are fakes and I doubt there is any emulator that replicates quality of anything close to a normal Gamecube.  Hardware emulation is a tough cookie to crack, and replicating an entire execution environment is no cake walk.  If you notice, even less complex systems, e.g. N64/SNES, when emulated sometimes crash.  Rarely is emulation 100%, in the gaming world."
,Sig357,2007-01-02T23:06Z,"my balls...
your mouth...

this image sucks!!!


i downloaded a good zelda image at 
http://gctracker.mine.nu:800/

been playing it 2 days no problem.

my cube is USA w/ viper extreme and cobra 1.6 + laser mod.

,super_202,2007-01-04T15:45Z,this torrents doesnt work why? I have azureus
,Divinus1985,2007-01-11T22:39Z,I have tried to load the game with an emulator and failed :-( Is it at all possible to play it on PC??
,elyk1212,2007-01-17T01:47Z,"Sig357, What 'sucks' about the image?  Are you unable to play it at all, etc.  BTW, as I said, been playing this great for some time now (well, when I get time ;) ).  


super_202, It works just fine on my cube, nothing wrong here. Azureus will do md5 hash checks for you to check if the downloaded files have been received correctly, so there 'should' be no issue that is not caught (bugs aside).

Divinus1985, I never have seen a GC emulator that works... yet.  Couldn't tell you for sure, however, there doesn't seem to be a very widely used (thus not widely tested) gamecube emulation for PC.  Therefore, expect bugs, and fakes and viruses (from emulators and things claiming to be so).  Fun!  Eh... not to discourage though.

There are good gamecube emulators so.. LOL! on you"
,Linus83,2008-02-27T19:50Z,So does this work with Dolphin emulator or not?
,Nympheti,2008-04-26T12:14Z,Does this work to just open with Dolphin Emu?
,submarinersdoitdeeper,2008-05-30T01:39Z,"works fine on my gamecube, with a XenoGC 2.0 and no change to the POT.

Burned onto Memorex DVD-R. Played it for hours, with a little frame skip on FMV."
,narutomaaan,2008-07-12T20:36Z,"there is  1 emulator that can run  gamecube games but not as good as a real gamecube, but still it can run it. There is a new beta version that requires a 64bit operating system and can run games up to 15-30 fps"
,bowseroffun,2008-08-07T21:00Z,"NO LOL ON YOU IDIOTS THERE IS A GAMECUBE EMULATORS EVERYWHERE ONE IS NAMED
DOLPHIN < GC EMULATOR HAHAH!"
,LordOrwell,2008-10-12T07:17Z,"yes it's true there is a gamecube emulator.  The only one that even comes close to playing a game properly is dolphin, and that's only if you get the 64-bit latest release.  the older ones give you 1-2 fps.  The latest goes up to 30 if you have recompile turned on, but it's not perfect.  It locks up on mine with this game with recompile.  Interpreting works fine but it is about 1/2 the speed."
,Onlydownloader,2009-01-10T12:49Z,I don't understand it's like 50 rar files.. what should i do. Please someone help me:/ ( Jag förstår inte de är typ 50 rar filer vad ska jag göra de choc jobbit :( )

,seapmonkey,2009-06-05T16:24Z,"Ok... I can get this to work in Dolphin running at the right speed, but I don't get any audio. I've read all the comments, but it seems that I'm the only one willing to trouble shoot Dolphin and find out why it doesn't work. 
As far as FPS go, I can get it to run over 450 FPS. 25~30 is about where you want it for game play, but I can't figure out the audio. 

Here is the thing for Dolphin: 
You need to configure the core for Dolphin. I don't know what will work best for you, but I have Dual core shut off because it will run to fast. but if you configure the GFX and the diffrent plugins you should be able to get it to work. 

Now as far as the Audio goes... I have tried a couple thing her and there but no success... I'll let you know if I can get that working!
