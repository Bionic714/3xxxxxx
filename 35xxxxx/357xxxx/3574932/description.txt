"This edition uses the latest research in sheep nutrition to update a classic reference. Important new information has been added that is derived from the results of recent research in nutrition requirements for all phases of lamb and wool production. These have been incorporated into tables of energy requirements and feed formulas in both metric and English measurements. In addition, practical husbandry information and descriptions of nutritional deficiencies are supplemented by an extensive bibliography."
