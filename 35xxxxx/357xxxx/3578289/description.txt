San Francisco-based Tarnation comprised Paula Frazer (vocals/guitar), Alex Oropeza (guitar), Bill Cuevas (bass/lap steel) and Joe Byrnes (drums).

Using country music as a springboad, Tarnation explored harrowing emotional terrain on their 1995 debut Gentle Creatures. Paula's stark vocals split the difference between Patsy Cline and Leonard Cohen, while the band's plaintive twangs and rumbles imbued her songs with an ever-escalating sense of unease.
