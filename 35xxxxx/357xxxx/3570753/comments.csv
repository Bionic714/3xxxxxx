,Robihot,2006-12-06T20:08Z,"Req: FS Panel Studio

I've made an autopilot for the ND EC120B that holds a heading and alt in forward flight, but I keep getting XML errors and I'm hoping FS Panel Studio will help.  So, if someone can seed (or reseed) FS Panel Studio, plz do.  I love these choppers but it takes so damn long to fly anywheres :)"
,Robihot,2006-12-06T20:50Z,"Regarding my request, thanks to the kind person who seeded FS Panel Studio!"
,WinnieXL,2006-12-09T00:33Z,"Thanks for deze mooie helie! Moeilijk vind ik het ermee te vliegen, zwabber alle kanten op."
,4X-AXG,2006-12-09T01:46Z,"bij heli's zet ik altijd het realisme niveau wat lager, dan vliegen ze veel stabieler..met het realisme niveau op z'n hoogst zijn de meeste heli's vrijwel niet te controleren..voor mij dan tenminste ;-)"
,tex99999,2006-12-12T15:04Z,Thanks a Million $X but I must be stupid because when I extracted the file I ended up with just a big mess of files. First time downloading payware so I must be missing sonething?
,4X-AXG,2006-12-13T21:48Z,"nope, just look for 'setup.exe' within that big mess of files"
,tex99999,2006-12-14T04:10Z,"Thanks 4x - I did find it, I guess I was so excited to get it finally."
,Robihot,2006-12-21T17:22Z,Has anyone found a way to get good fps in VC (30 or more)?  I think it's the gauges that are made in gmax that are causing low fps.

unless you advise otherwise, but first I need a little seeding help from your loyal followers.

Thanks soo much for the great upload :)> 

BTW, can anyone suggest where I can purchase some used HW (peddles, etc..) to play these little gems more efficently?"
