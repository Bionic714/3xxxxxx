The action of the film takes place in the 17th century, in the period of the Polish-Swedish war. The plot is woven around the stormy love of the main character in the film, Andrzej Kmicic (Daniel Olbrychski), for a young gentlewoman named OleSka. Based on the novel by Nobel prize winning author Henryk Sienkiewicz, much of this exciting and romantic film was shot in authentic, ancient Polish castles.
