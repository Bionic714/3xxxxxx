,fortnera87,2006-12-12T04:39Z,"I have been seeding the whole time and am still seeding as we speak, like I said, I'll be seeding this file non-stop but you others out there please seed it as well, it takes very little bandwidth. I've had at least 10 download this file from me and they say their speed goes pretty fast, takes them a second to download it from me."
