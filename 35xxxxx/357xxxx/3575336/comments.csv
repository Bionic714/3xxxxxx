,cissp06,2007-01-08T13:19Z,Where is Cross Eyed Mary? I decoded with flac and track 1 is Nothing is easy.
,cissp06,2007-01-08T23:25Z,Budapest is cut.... Wish I'd known all this before I downloaded.
,Finnanhaddie,2007-07-09T10:54Z,"The show fades in with Nothing Is Easy, Budapest is cut; the show fades out during Aqualung.  Pity this is incomplete as the quality is very, very good.
The running order on the torrent description is for the entire concert...not for what is actually available on this torrent.  Description should be corrected.
Now if the missing tracks were available..."

Beside that, this recording is terribly off-speed"
