,xr0,2006-12-08T13:00Z,"Bad audio, bad video. This is not a good release, I'm waiting for a proper one."

[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-08T14:13Z,It seems like no scene group want's to take time releasing a proper. :/
[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-08T14:15Z,"K@js@: There are plenty of seeders, always! Torrents have the way of starting slow (due to the fact that when you connect, you don't have a single byte to share)"
,siraH,2006-12-08T14:24Z,worth download. Video : 8/10 audio : 5/10 ( just put the treble down and the sound quality will be better.
,k@js@,2006-12-08T14:42Z,"okey, but I've been downloading for like an hour and mine is only 3.7% I use bittorrent."

[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-09T09:20Z,"XoF: The first comment I made was that this was nuked, and then i linked to a proper one for people who prefer perfect releases, so don't write shit! This is completely watchable, but of course the proper is better."
