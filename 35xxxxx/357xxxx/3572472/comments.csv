,i2mfan,2006-12-07T16:29Z,I might be late tomorrow(Dec. 8) or have no new episodes because I will have to rip and encode the next batch from the PVR. I also should have the last few episodes of  season 3 recorded over the weekend if the EPG is good and don't have technical troubles of any kind. Cross your fingers :D
