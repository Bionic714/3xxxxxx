,DrTachyon,2009-01-22T02:19Z,"I have the closest to a complete discog and its at 35 GB - 264 Albums, so this is no where near a complete disog"

By the way, DrTachyon, have you uploaded your Miles Davies collection? If not, you should shut up and just be grateful."

,zatara2008,2009-06-02T04:42Z,Thanks for a great offering..  I'm sure it was lots of work putting this all together..
,thuerrsch,2009-06-23T01:16Z,"Nice try, but unfortunately this collection is simply too chaotic to be of any real use. It's far from complete, there are duplicates, the bitrates are at the low end, directory and file names/tags are unsystematic, in short: If this was a sock drawer, you'd have to walk barefoot most of the time."

thanks europabunch for sharing what you have"
