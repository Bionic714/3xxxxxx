Tony-winning extravaganza based on the 1994 Disney film, with book by Roger Allers and Irene Mecchi, music by Elton John, lyrics by Tim Rice, and additional songs by Hans Zimmer, Lebo M, Mark Mancina and Jay Rifkin. This visual feast is famous for director Julie Taymor's complex animal-puppet-human fusion. The musical tells the Hamlet-like tale of Simba, prince of African lions, who battles his evil Uncle Scar for the throne after Scar kills Simba's father, and blames the murder on Simba. But before Simba is able to take his rightful place in the "Circle of Life" he grows up with two fun-loving friends, wisecracking meerkat Timon and smelly warthog Pumbaa, who teach him their philosophy of life -- "Hakuna Matata" (No Worries). The score includes the Oscar-winning song, "Can You Feel the Love Tonight." Suitable for all ages.
