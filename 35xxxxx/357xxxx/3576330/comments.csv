,bprod,2009-08-21T22:09Z,"ehbreno, it is a movie, it was produced and sold as a movie. Daft Punk partnered with Leiji Matsumoto to produce a movie with no spoken words, save for those in the soundtrack. They liked the idea of a movie that needed no words. and I must say, it turned out epically. Got the album for Christmas a few years ago and remembered seeing the movie late one night on Toonami before it went lame. Thanks for this torrent!"
