Synopsis
It┬┤s a hilariously haunting Halloween in the 100 Acre Wood. Roo┬┤s best new pal, Lumpy, is excited to trick-or-treat for the first time ... until Tigger warns them about the dreaded Gobloon, who┬┤ll turn you into a Jaggedy Lantern if he catches you. But if they catch the Gobloon before it catches them, they get to make a wish! With Roo by his side, Lumpy knows he can face anything. So when Pooh eats all the Halloween candy, Lumpy and Roo decide to be ┬┤┬┤brave together, brave forever┬┤┬┤ and catch the Gobloon so they can wish for more. When the two friends become separated, however, Roo decides to wish for something even more important. Filled with adventure, unconditional friendship, and lots of laughter, this is a sweet treat for the whole family..
