en_scp? Hello Sir...

are you there?

If you ever come back to this page, please seed some if you still have the file, time and bandwidth, if you don't mind. According to the statistics this file was never downloaded (not that I'd bet my life on tpb statistics), and that is a shame... I promise I'll take over seeding for a few years. I'll just wait here for a few months somewhere between four and twentyfour hours a day, EVERY DAY.

Thank you, Seeder Sir!"
