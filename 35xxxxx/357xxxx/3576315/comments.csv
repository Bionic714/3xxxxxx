Great thanks."
,tatsudoshi,2006-12-27T11:18Z,More seeds please :)
,doff12345,2007-01-05T20:08Z,"is this the original? From 1982? I want it, I heard so much brilliant things about the original edition, about the ending!! Harrison Ford Rocks!! "
,Nurmis,2007-01-13T18:50Z,"People, would you PLEASE seed this? Yesterday I had it coming at above 50kb/s, and now it's under 1kb/s! I want to see this movie! D:"

,whocares401,2008-03-15T19:52Z,"I've been downloading this version for 7 days and am hung up at 61.5%.  Nobody is seeding! Damn and I wanted to get this version as it was the one I originally saw in the movie theatre when I was blown away by Blade Runner.  Common somebody who has 100%, please seed it.  Thanks in advance."
,whocares401,2008-03-30T05:04Z,"Well.... another week has gone by and all I can say is... ""Time to Die"" as ""Nobody Lives Forever"".  This ISO file only completes to 61.5% which is not enough to make a disc so I would say that it is time to let this one go and delete the torrent and file on your computer.  Pity really because this one really deserves to be in the BR library."
,skz5k2,2008-05-03T23:45Z,I continue to try. Maybe someone will SEED!!!
,skz5k2,2008-05-17T16:44Z,"ok, I have to admit whocares401 is right.
it's definitely dead!"
,skz5k2,2008-05-31T03:05Z,I give up
