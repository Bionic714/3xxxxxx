Ripped from the Criterion Laserdisc edition. This version contains the narrations by Deckard. This cut is not available on DVD. The video has been sitting on my computer for a long time now and was originally intended to be a 3 CD SVCD release. I figure people would prefer a DVD release instead, but that's the reason for not maxing out on file size.
