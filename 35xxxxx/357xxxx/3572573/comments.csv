,gaiusmuhammad,2006-12-07T20:06Z,I'll be seeding this until there is a new build.
,gaiusmuhammad,2006-12-07T20:14Z,and this torrent is faster. 
,69RocketGC,2006-12-11T11:52Z,I played a 2 week trial of this a while back.. Is it still gonna werk? New Build? And u are recruiting people on 2 week trial?
,69RocketGC,2006-12-11T12:03Z,Oh ya I almost forgot... Does this work on Vista?
,gaiusmuhammad,2006-12-12T11:33Z,"Yes it should work with your old trial account.. but you might want to start a new character since new chars get 800k from the start and advanced learning skill only require  prereqs to IV.

Also no problem with Vista."
,DataSchmuck,2006-12-13T13:00Z,"I was killing NPC pirates in an asteroid belt the a few days ago in 0.4 space, and this guy warps in, propulsion jams me, and cap drains me, and starts firing away, there was nothing I could do, so I said I give up.  He asked me how much I had.  I told him, and he said okay I won't be greedy, and only asked for half of it.  I gave him the cash, and he let me go on my way.

MUCH better than my previous pirate experience, a gate camper in 0.2 space, destroyed my ship in 5 shots, then instantly killed my pod, no ransom, no explanations.  I lost a TON of loot and a nice expensive ship."
,games_ownz,2007-02-12T21:55Z,How much it costs?
,anakondase,2007-07-07T20:12Z,"FFS

Go to http://www.eve-online.com and download the game from there, that doesn't cost you anything.

You can register for a free trial on the site itself

no need to get files, cracks, keygens and crap through this site for this game... that's pointless."
