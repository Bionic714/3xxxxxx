Rush Rules!"
,XxM24Ty,2010-02-01T08:12Z,Long Time Fan of the band here. I have purchased this same album/CD many times. I wanted to say that this mix sounds the best of any version I have heard of the album. Trivia: There is a certain song on this version that is missing an entire line of lyrics. MFSL claimed the master tapes were given to them with the line of lyrics missing. Can you find the song I'm speaking of without searching on Google for the answer?
[T],rjordan21,2010-03-28T04:50Z,"XxM24Ty, thanks for the trivia.  Sounds SO weird without that line.  Another long time fan here.  First show was Moving Pictures tour. MAN, this album brings back so many great memories.  I hope younger generations take the time to really listen to everything from a particular artist.  When you can get an entire discography in a few mouse clicks I think it's hard to do so.  I know my kids will be exposed to every note though! Thanks again."
