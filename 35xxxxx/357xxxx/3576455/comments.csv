,babelfish42,2008-03-26T05:02Z,"i dont know if it was just me but i didnt get the full movie, starts at least 15 minutes in."
,xsolarwindx,2008-06-05T17:58Z,"You guys are wrong, this is the full movie. Forward to 9:30 into the movie and you see the intro. The intro is a little into the movie. This is a great release.

Proof: if you go here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120347/ the running time says 119 minutes. Now check your download, exactly 118 minutes. There you go, great release.

I'm seeding."

,shiningwiz,2010-05-15T08:28Z,All you have to do is look at the file size... a 1997 movie compressed to 606 MB? Of course it's gonna be very pixelated and full of glitches. I'm just amazed that there aren't many 700-800 MB files available for the Pierce Brosnan Bond films. Just amazed.
,billycoolblues,2010-06-09T13:08Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD ONLY 56:05 of the movie present. INCOMPLETE MOVIE. Report for removal
