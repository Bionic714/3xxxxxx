thanks alot, rebeiro4"
,Cordinator,2007-01-19T01:03Z,"rebeiro4 you need a high speed connection that can handle the speeds, and you need a good tracker with people that seed, and a good client then you can reach any speed you want or your harddrive sets the limitation. ( a friend of mine was HDD limited on his laptop with a 100/10 connection)"
