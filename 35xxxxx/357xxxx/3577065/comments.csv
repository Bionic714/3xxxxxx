,torrenting,2006-12-15T09:18Z,"This is a GREAT release from PUKKA. First, the quality is awesome on this. Picture looks great with a resolution of 672Ă&#x2014;352. Audio is also fantastic at AC3 5.1. There is a ""Property of..."" statement that runs across the bottom of the screen approximately 3-4 times the whole movie. This is a great release for a great movie.
