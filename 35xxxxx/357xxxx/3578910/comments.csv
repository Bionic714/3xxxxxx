,wicKedShaydes,2012-05-10T23:48Z,"this shows great! i've always loved Patricia Arquet but was never able to watch the series often enough. Thanks!

OH, one quick question for any who know: I'm somewhat new here and have figured out most of the terms but do all files titled 'DVD-Rip' mean its one file meant to rip straight to DVD? (the last few i tried were like that) Sometimes Im looking for DVD quality for older movies that have been copied from a DVD but can be be watched without burning. How does one tell the difference? Thanx!"
,wicKedShaydes,2012-05-25T01:17Z,"Just finished watching the whole lot of em. Was great except for one small thing....the last file is titled episode 15(1-2) since the season ends with a 'to be continued' two parter. Unfortunately the second part or true last episode is missing.
I couldn't find the individual episode to download anywhere either, just my luck. so now im waiting for another full season torrent to finish downloading just to see episode 16 lol  Other then that great job tho! Thanks"
,wicKedShaydes,2012-05-25T17:12Z,"ok so, i think my last comment regarding the missing episode can be ignored lol the title made me think it should have two but now im thinking its just the first episode of season 2. which i cant find anywhere anyway. except your set but everyone says its got some issues. since i have no other options tho im downloading to see. most times i dont have the same issues as others report. fingers crossed!"
