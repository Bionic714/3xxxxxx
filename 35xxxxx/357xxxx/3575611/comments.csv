i have one suggestion... to make it possible for more people to download, can you also upload more compressed versions of such material ? i assume this is 60 minute program... on tvshows.yoyo.pl     1-shows are reduced to 120mb.... its suprisingly good quality...

thanks again..."

I recommend it to everyone. This is what I think will happen in some years."
