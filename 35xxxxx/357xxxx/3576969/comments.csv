,CitizenBen,2007-04-25T14:36Z,I'd appreciate a seed please...
,NoDancingNotAllowed,2007-06-14T17:55Z,If you're gonna download these files....at least make a donation at RiffTrax.com.  How do you think they pay to make these mp3's.  Plus each mp3 is only 3 dollars and you can buy them with paypal.
,philbongahue,2007-06-19T00:30Z,"They even made it easier to donate, so no excuses:

,acidoklysm,2007-07-18T21:55Z,hahaha. Don't bother downloading this anyway. Chances are very good that whoever mixed the audio didnt do it right. just get the riff mp3 and an xvid of the movie and mix it yourself.

,normalman,2010-01-05T15:34Z,"I will seed this for a million years if I can get a seed!!

[T],Juan.Too,2010-02-21T00:54Z,"Wow.
You'd think that after three years of waiting for a seed you guys would just give up.
Ten points for tenacity though, I suppose."
,nhprm,2010-05-26T03:02Z,"Still waiting, too."
