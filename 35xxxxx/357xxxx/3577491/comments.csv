,MisplacedFate1313,2008-06-23T00:12Z,"Looks like we're permanently a megabyte short on this one. No big deal, it's a pretty considerable volume. It would be nice if a single seeder could come on (like maybe dmonhiro himself) and give us that extra .2%. In the meantime, we'll have to enjoy this collection as it is."
[T],Hgames,2009-03-08T12:42Z,http://thepiratebay.org/user/Hgames/ I have just about every single one of those games. Some of those are very old and I doubt you will get most of them to run on winxp or vista for that matter. Everything I have is a proper release.
,zimbobwa1,2009-07-20T02:38Z,"you should mention language too ^_^ that would be nice, ty for upload! Too bad there's no seeders =/"
