,FrostyButt,2009-03-24T17:00Z,"your idea of quality is very low m8.
Considering the era, and these are not remastered, including all that, even a good rip would get a 10/10 just for being what it is.
However, this rip has only 1 episode (e01) that did not contain skips, missing segments, fragmented avi's throughout every single show.
I'm surprised this has lasted here two years, it is a horrid encode."
,lordmod,2010-04-29T08:09Z,Is this the one the show from the 70s or from today because the one im looking for is the one from the 70s
