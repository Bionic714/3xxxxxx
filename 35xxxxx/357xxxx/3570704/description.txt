Mac OS X 10.4 Server - Universal

This is the Universal version of Mac OS X Server,
it should be installable on any supported PPC or Intel System

Note that you need a serial to be able to install this version

Didn't find it on TPB so here it is.

Originally downloaded from Demonoid, so creds to the people over there.
