,Moshe13us,2006-12-08T02:16Z,"Just one thing : 
where the hell are the styles 59 to 66 (v.2007 installs only #65 and v.2006 stops at #58) ???
Any smart idea ?

Thanx
Mo"
,Bengan65,2006-12-09T05:30Z,"I actually bought this upgrade, the only new styles that comes with it is no: 65 the others you have to pay for........"
,Moshe13us,2006-12-09T15:46Z,"I confirm : you get the new styles only if you buy 2007 Megapack 'as opposed to the upgrade)...

Thanx anyway: the drums samples pack rocks !!

I downloaded this update, but don't know how to install it... Is there anyone who can help me please?"
,Carlo Natali,2007-01-28T23:05Z,"Thanks Bengan65! This is a new and improved versjon of the BIAB witch give much better freedom to choose compare to the old versjon.
I will really like to get the other RealDrums styles to see if there is a better way of choosing a rhythmpattern of the RealDrum.Thank again, I think I'll buy the program real soon myself."
,ZipmaO,2007-01-29T21:07Z,"so this won't work until I have installed the real drums altso?

because I get a error message something like ""Need To Increase..."""
