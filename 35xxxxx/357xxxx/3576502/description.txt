What is the U2XMP Community Edition Installer

    Well, as some of you may know I've been working on this for some time now but the first version is now complete. What it is is basically an all-in-one installer for U2XMP with several key additions:

        * Pre-patched to 7710
        * New master server support by default
        * Some of the more common maps installed
        * My new PID healthbars and the masterserver UI preinstalled
        * MapVote and Summoner mutators included.
        * Full un-install support

BIG THX EQ2 FOR MAKING THIS...


so this is standalone installer...
