,tisemann,2006-12-06T17:25Z,what the hell? it's gonna take a week to dl this dvdr with the speed it's coming up with from the original seeder.
,B-manSwe,2006-12-06T23:11Z,"Thanx a lot, been waiting for this, the retail-dvd got some kind of new ""copy""-protection, when you try to rip that it says ""invalid dvd-structure"",  and when you try to copy it, it says about the same thing...so fuck the gnarly ass mocie-companies, information wants to be free, and your lame-ass copy-protections cant stop that....."
,B-manSwe,2006-12-06T23:12Z,i meant movie-companies
,macyme,2006-12-07T04:19Z,I never complain about seeding and speed but why is this movie taking so long
,c08,2006-12-07T06:23Z,boegroeff. My mom's free too if you wanna take a turn. One thing though: She won't go ass-to-mouth. Sorry..her rule not mine.

,B-manSwe,2006-12-07T20:58Z,"aaa ha ha, boegroeff and you are a downloader?...or are you just here for the comments?...there you go...as long as a dvd-movie in sweden cost over 200sek i download it, easy as that, and the legal downloading sites havent got a clue because there you get the same dvd without back and front-covers for about 189sek, heeellooo...."
,poorkid,2006-12-07T23:36Z,Are you gonna seed this? I always wonder what goes on on the heads of those who decides to upload a torrent and then don't seed it. What is the plan? Do they get second thoughts after a couple of hours of seeding or what? I don't get it.
,macyme,2006-12-12T17:35Z,"Is this torrent a right off, I was stuck at 11.7% for days and gave up."
,OldPaint,2006-12-13T08:09Z,"0 times d/l 84 leeches and NO seeder... WTF where did hippogriff go?
Please come back & seed this for us 84 poor leechers stuck @ 11.7%"
,empty.handed,2006-12-15T01:30Z,"11.7 %  and holding strong.. 


seeding your torrent would be cool.."
,amac13,2006-12-16T03:07Z,Everyone is stuck at 11.7. We all appreciate the fact that you uploaded this movie...but please seed it so we can get it. Thanks
