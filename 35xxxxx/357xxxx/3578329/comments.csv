,AbeOddworld,2007-01-02T10:01Z,"They are 6 DVDs. This files are NOT one movie.
Burn it on 6 DVDs.
Double Layers."
,Interpolice,2007-01-04T05:27Z,"Response to Sam:

I use Azureus. I click to download the torrent file.

When it shows up in the ""Torrents"" tab, I double click
on the P.S. 1-6 torrent name.

That brings up a detailed set of sub-tabs for it.
Looking in the Files sub-tab, each movie has around 7-7.5 Gb of VOB files.

Someone has just posted SuperFuckers #6 in codec form. Hopefully someone will post the rest that way too. This is too big, even though I know I can download individual movies."

,pbox42,2009-06-27T03:26Z,"Kozilek, murmelwurmel, I got the same error as yours.

I have a solution. It's a 3-step process and involves a couple of softwares.
1.Burn the VIDEO_TS folder into a video DVD9 image (.iso or .nrg) using a software such as Nero Burning Rom
2.Use a free Daemon Tool Lite to mount the .iso, .nrg to the file system
3.Use CloneDVD2 software (evaluation version available) to shrink/split the DVD9 into DVDRs.

Hope this helps.

To rendermans, thank you for the contribution. It's time tested because it's been available since 2006. Please make available the rest of the series if you have. ;-)"
