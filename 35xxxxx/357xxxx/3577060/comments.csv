,Geldethi,2007-01-22T01:48Z,"This is not a movie everyone should see and pass to friends, its a bunch of insulting crap and rubbish backed up by no facts or experts whatsoever. The documakers idea of a professional is anyone who can tie there shoes in under five mins."

If you can't accept that people have ideas about the world, that does not match your own ideas, you could be the next Bush!

They said on the Alex Jones Show a while back that it MIGHT be finished and released sometime in March (this month, as of writing)..."

,imru2b12,2008-01-10T20:15Z,"it's also hillarious that you people who insult these  beliefs don't even question ANY of these issues. How is it possible that you  can say that this has no creedence or truth? Some very valid points are addressed, but because Fox News uses their spin machine to destroy its reputability; you buy into it. It's laughable that so many people dismiss all that is going on around them. The U.S. govt DID have plans to kill american citizens; declassified info is straight from the horses mouth you fools.  Our govt even later apologized for it. Joint chiefs of staff wanted to blow up american citizens and blame it all on cuba as a reason to go to war. Google or youtube ""operation northwoods"". Do the same with ""gulf of tonkin"". WAke up sheeple! Damn"
