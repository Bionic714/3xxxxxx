Q&A:

Q - What is MUGEN?
A - MUGEN is a customization fighting game engine

Q - What is Mugen Fighting Jam?
A - A Premade Mugen Fighting Game originally using the AWESOME MFJ screenpack for it

Q - Why make a premade one, isn\'t finding stuff to make your own part of the fun?
A - In a word... no. It\'s streuous and some chars are\'nt even online anymore. That\'s why MFG exists. For noobs and normal folk that don\'t want to miss out on the MUGEN craze.

Q - Is this version 2?
A - the answer is only half yes... This is the \"condensed\" version of the new version. That are\'nt as many chars but the quality of the game is much higher than the first.

Q - Why make 2 versions?
A -  The slim version is for people following the quality over quantity and the fatty is for the people in a vice-versa philosophy.

Q - Is this Illegal?
A - No, it\'s alright

Q - Are\'nt prepackaged games againist the mugen community rules...
A - Yes and No, theres alot of grey line there so I\'m not bothering with it. They\'re are people acting like the police that are\'nt and way too much drama. I just want to release something to make it easier on people getting into mugen.

Q - I think MFG is awesome and want to join the team
A - There are awesome forums at www.dacforever.com and a wiki that needs finished. Just make yourself known.

Q - I have just a few suggestions for it
A - same thing

Q - This SOUNDTRACK/CHAR/STAGE SUCKS remove it from the pack!!!
A - post on the forums and we\'ll see. if I don\'t agree then you can remove it from your game using the tools I included

Q - How do I change the background music
A - By copying the mp3 to the sound folder, opening the stageviewer (in the configurating mugen folder), selecting the stage, going to (Options > Change Music) and selecting that mp3

Q - How do I add a char/stage to it
A - Mugen Windows Configurator should be able to do it just add it to that specific folder and click add (char/stage) and doyuble click on the def file. Just remember to delete the randomselect if it\'s a char

Q - MFj isn\'t working!!!!
A - you can get it to your pcs specs by going to the config option in mugen windows configurator. That\'s why I included it
