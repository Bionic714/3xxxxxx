,shanlot751,2006-12-18T06:01Z,"This blasted thing won't let me edit it but I want to give some credit out to Hisoushi for pushing me into making a second one, getting a second version of winmugen and doing a hell of alot of research on char,stage,motif sites for the MFJ. Also I want to give a thanks to Valhalla and Jasmine for support through this project which was much needed through this Last month. Thanks."
,shanlot751,2006-12-18T06:03Z,"and also Hisoushi again for brainstorming with me on ideas on improving it. It would not be near this far without ya, Thanks."
,shanlot751,2006-12-18T06:19Z,No problem Sonvalhala I hope you enjoy it.
,Hioushi,2006-12-18T06:42Z,"No problem man, it's been a pleasure. I always thought since I downloaded the first version it was a great idea and had a lot of potential. 

People here won't even imagine the amount of time and effort you have invested to make this release. 

We all hope this would bring a new face into the mugen community.

Enjoy =D "

,GREZZO16,2009-03-20T12:47Z,"Hi to everyone
since shanlot disappeared in 2007, i've decided to keep the community alive for this amazing project.

This version (v2slim) it's the only ""officially"" supported because it has lot of improvements and bug fixes over the v1.

I'm working on a patch/update/fix for V2 and it will be aviable on the official forums before the end of March 2009.

stay tuned
