,Reevs,2006-12-11T20:22Z,This one seems to be like 2/3  of the movie... the best song in the world are missing..  as are the end of the story....  
,slurpee,2006-12-19T13:16Z,"what's missing is a good reason for this to be a multipart RAR.  there's no defensible reason to have a torrent RAR'ed like this - pull out of the IRC dark ages.

that's right.  i'll choose to NOT download something because it's RAR'ed."
,Mardok45,2006-12-21T20:53Z,"Is anyone having trouble getting the movie to play?  I can play the sample movie, but the movies inside the BIN images won't play.

Can I get some instructions please."
,Wengeven,2006-12-26T22:16Z,"[Response to revs comment]
I've seen the movie and Tribute (the best song in the world) is not in it. That song was on their last album."
,THE D FUCKING ROCK,2007-01-01T23:48Z,"HAHAHAH den beste måten tenacious d skiller ut ekte fans med fake fans. Ifølge dem er den beste sangen i verden Beelzeboss- fra det nye albumet. På tribute synger de om hvordan de spilte den beste da de møtte djevelen, og at tibute ikke er den beste men at det er en hyllest til den beste. Å på slutten av filmen rett før de røyker fra THEBOD så sier han""i think that was the greatest song weve ever played. Pass deg ellers straffer satan deg"
,vaalross,2007-01-08T14:56Z,"no the song tribute has nothing at all to do with the final showdown that is in this movie, the song tribute is not about a devil, it is about a demon that they met out in ""lonesome road"". only a complete retard could say it is about this movie -.- listen to the damn lyrics man! "
