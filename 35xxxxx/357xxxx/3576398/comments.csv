this is a french language film  but comes w english subtiles  included in the torrent and they work perfect...at least they did for me on computer in kmplayer or gom media player  real easy  just open and enjoy the movie

unfortunatley  not a good   movie to me i was expecting pure horror ala   martyrs etc due to the french horror wave..this is more a comedy  horror adventure  but some may like this sort of hybrid thing

thanks for the upload  well done"
