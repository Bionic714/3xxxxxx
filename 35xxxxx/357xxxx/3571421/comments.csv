you mean ""no sound for you"" - just because something is not working for you doesn't always mean that it's broken. 99.9% of the time these type of comments are from a problem at your end.

it has AC3 sound, do you have that codec installed??
Try testing it with a player that has it's own codecs like http://www.videolan.org

search the web for help with AC3 or some help/links/info about codecs halfway down the topic here
http://www.666fs.com/viewtopic.php?p=4494

that should fix you up. :)
