Assigning a musical genre to Dead Can Dance is difficult, as its style 

is particularly eclectic. However, its early work could be considered 

"darkwave". In their later work, including and subsequent to the 

release entitled The Serpent's Egg, Dead Can Dance would take ancient 

or various musics from around the world as primary sources, with 

Gerrard singing glossolalia, giving it a very distinctive style. As a 

result, their later albums sound quite different from the first three. 

Various sources have labelled those latter releases as neo-classical, 

ethereal or dark world music.
