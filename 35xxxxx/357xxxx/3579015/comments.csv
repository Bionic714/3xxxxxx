[V],Kefissos,2008-05-01T19:30Z,I don't what happens after two years. I have exactly the same 1.84 GB music on my Linux (Sidux) and can hear all the albums without any problems.
[V],Kefissos,2008-05-02T04:41Z,"By the way. I'am so tired to listen to people who always complains. Perhaps you have pains on your ass, or you doesn't like the great music. Perhaps you use Bill Gates fucking Windows, when nothing works. What about to use Sidux? Can you find out of it, or are all the people completely  helpless? But trust me, I'll continue upload new torrents world wide. This is an special address for the company watchers."
,Coltbear50,2008-06-06T13:01Z,"Kefissos, please don't be discouraged by the few idiots who either don't know how to download or who don't appreciate the excellent torrents you are making available for others to enjoy.  Dead Can Dance and Lisa Gerrard as a solo artist have both produced some of the finest music I've ever heard in my life, and I have over 6,000 CDs of all types of music, and I really appreciate you, and I'm sure a lot of other do as well.  So, keep on keeping on, and thanks!  :-)"
,Skin410,2008-07-12T14:06Z,"Many Thanks Kefissos, Great Music for hours!
Close my eyes and dreams away with this music."
,BTSeadog,2008-08-04T23:19Z,"Kefissos this collection is Heaven Sent! Thank you so much for putting this together and uploading it! 

CocoDodo you are such a NOOB.. 

Trying to play partially downloaded files are obviously going to break up and not play properly.. I'm amazed you can even turn your PC on if this is your level of understanding.
