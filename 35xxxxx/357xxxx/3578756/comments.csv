,Tri_Motor,2006-12-18T22:13Z,"Wow.   hey thanks for the rip of this pile... no need for an installer version.   it's not really worthy of such wasted bit-streams.    but seriously I appreciate your efforts...  after a quick flight around town.  you saved me from making the grave mistake of buying it. LoL

Lets hope that the up coming Iris F-15C is more closely match to the quality of their F-14.   ?????"

,toddw,2006-12-22T00:20Z,"Hi to all... thanks for the upload... I will continue to seed this one...  found quite a few bugs with this release (nothing big, just  small little annoying things)... beta testers aren't as good as they used to be.

Gear doors edges wrong color (not closed properly), aileron trim drift.., red VC light shows through the fuselage between intakes... VC blan !!... etc.

,ozmoderator,2007-02-03T08:09Z,"Much appreciated for the share. Haven't tried this one yet.

Is the FG.2 much better than this ??

Will continue to seed when I get it ;)"
