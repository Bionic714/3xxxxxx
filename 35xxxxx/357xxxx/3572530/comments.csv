,alfhaim7,2008-10-19T19:37Z,"ok here it goes...I cannot get the game to run...some directdraw problem (even though I have the latest drivers)
I've read through some forums that this happens on Vista :$
And that there is an official patch for this...
The problem is that the ""patch"" needs a crack...and the cracks available for it, aren't in english... At least I haven't found sth...
Can anyone pls (pretty pls) help...???
Thanks!!!"
