The historical representation is a direct copy of the Iranian Islamic way of thinking, the same people who claim that the holocaust is fiction.

The freemasons have secrets, but the secrets are related to succeeding better in life. It has nothing to do with corruption or world domination. The all seeing eye and other egyptian symbols including Roman symbols of fascism feks. found in Washington is artistic liberty. They might seem despicalble to some, but remember that the christian cross was a symbol of death and torture 2000 years ago.

By all means, download and listen, but do a little legwork afterwards - not much. 10 minutes with Google and you might just find yourself shaking your head like I did."
,captaink1,2007-07-02T16:11Z,"To save you from wasting an hour of your life, here is this program in a nutshell (emphasis on NUT):

Freemasons have been secretly running the world.  Only Islam will stop them.

This program is typical of the Muslim mix of fact, fiction and fantasy, such as ""Islam is a religion of peace.""

If you are looking for an expose on the Masons, look elsewhere."
,truthseekers,2008-09-29T20:16Z,"Freemasons are scum. They are self serving hypocrites who use secret ties to gain jobs over others and rise through the ranks by friend association and not by skill or worth. They seek positions of power such as government, police and civil service so they can spread their control network. They are dangerous because the collude to attack those against their organisation and they mislead those who look at their organisation with propaganda not facts. Nearly every prime minster of the UK has been a freemason. We are OWNED! 1 in 20 males is a freemason. WE ARE OWNED. "
