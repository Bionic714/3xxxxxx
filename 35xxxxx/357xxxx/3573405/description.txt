Release Notes
.............


The height of stardom doesnt seem that it will be much of a struggle for 22 year old artist Blak Genius who calls Sydney Home but has his eyes set on presenting Australian Hip Hop Music to the world by offering a whole dimension to the genre. 

Born in Ghana, he came to Sydney when he was 7 and began writing at the age of 16, and now Blak Genius is trying to close the gap between Australia and the rest of the world with his music being more accessible and able to compete on an international scale. 

With influences including Nas, Tupac and Rakim to hybrid groups such as Rage Against The Machine, Genius has absorbed these elements with his unique style to create a whole new sound. His music takes the genre to a whole other level. 


All Covers Included With This Release.
Enjoy! :-)
