,ebbaah,2006-12-18T20:23Z,It does work but the exe tryes to modify internet explorer security settings. So think twice before downloading.
,RogerPersson,2006-12-19T02:35Z,What do you talking about? It didnt do that on my computer. Maybe you should scan your own computer for spyware if you have hijacker problems. Ive got this exe from Gamecopyworld.com yesterday and my computer is clean. 
,pbfrik,2006-12-19T16:43Z,"hmm didnt notice any thing.. Downloaded from both Gamecopyworld and bay, scanned the file but nothing to be found.."
