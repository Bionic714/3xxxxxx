,algelis,2006-12-22T17:49Z,its peace of shit
,WonderSlug,2008-02-14T07:50Z,"Why did you pack them as RARs?

I just wanted a few albums, not all 24.

Should have kept them as individual MP3s that I could select."
,NorseGuy,2008-02-27T20:44Z,"To you who complain: As long as there's nothing majorly wrong with the conversion, you are just poiled brats. Go and buy the albums yourselves.

Thank you for your effort of uploading these Scorpions albums lonesome_crow :-)"
,frequent980,2008-03-28T12:47Z,Then go buy few albums you want. If you don't like what you see then don't download the torrent and take your complaints somewhere else. Be glad this fellow even uploaded the material.  Talk about spoiled brats biting the hand that feeds. Sheesh
,Turbonerd,2008-04-17T15:15Z,"Quite a lot of songs from this torrent just seem to cut out halfway through. Dunno if it's a fault on my end, but I've just had to scrap the whole thing and download from elsewhere."
