I'm a pervert. I'm an exhibitionist. I'm a masturbator. And a killer... Like you.

A butcher. An animal. A monster. Jeffrey Dahmer was vilified when authorities discovered he had murdered, dismembered and even tried to consume the bodies of 15 young men in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. But is there such a thing as a human monster? Based on the true story, this tale of terror dares to explore the truth of a man many called an abomination of nature, but who was most decidedly a living, breathing person. One Man. 15 Bodies. 957 Years. His Story Is Finally Told.
