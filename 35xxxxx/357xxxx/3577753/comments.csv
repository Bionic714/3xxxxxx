Ian is the real Alan Parsons member! ), the drummer is good though, he sings in some songs and he really did a great job, P.J. Olson is also a great singer but why not choose a better one for this band like Chris Rainbow or the legend Lenny Zakatek? For all Alan Parsons fans this concert is a must see but for the inconditionals fans this performance sucks quite a lot... it could be much much better...considering the time fans had been waiting for so long...anyway thanks a lot altovoltaje! Por el nick debes ser espa単ol...saludos! como ves mi ingles es patetico :-) "
