For years fans have been looking for a video from Alan Parsons and finally that dream has come true!

The "Live In Madrid" video was recorded during the May 14, 2004 show at Plaze Mayor in Madrid. The location is a gorgeous plaza surrounded by historoic buildings. The audience was in fine form and the reception grew stronger as the nigh wore on.

It's an amazing performance and for many fans this is the first opportunity they will have to see Alan's new touring band. These truly professional musicians give a polished performace, and perhaps have the best harmony of any of the various band line-ups that Alan has toured with. An added treat is that Alan sings lead vocals on three songs and all band members take turns doing lead vocals.

enjoy the project.
