this serial worked for me.  It still required activation - which I did NOT do.  "
,Harmer1,2006-12-16T19:24Z,"splanters SN above, gave me an error when it was entered. A waste of time without some working activation"
,dagada,2006-12-16T21:01Z,"Here is how to crack Photoshop CS3 and get rid of the trial period:
1) Complete the installation as usual
2) Go to \Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS3\AMT
3) Rename the file called application.sif to something else, like application.sif_ "
,Man Machine,2006-12-19T23:18Z,"@dagada:

How can you be sure this works? You posted that message before two days had gone by. ;-)

It didn't work for me. I could only use it for two days, even though I follwed your instructions. Have tried both reinstalling and even downloading and installing another of the torrents. 

So: anybody got this thing working for more than two days? And if so: how?

Thanks."
,Loki1391,2006-12-21T06:28Z,"dagada's instructions seemed to have worked, the 2 day activation warning has gone away.

Will re-post if it returns."
,Man Machine,2006-12-22T10:44Z,It DOES work. I reinstalled once again and more than two days have passed. So I'm guessing it works after all.
,baldwin,2007-01-02T16:01Z,Thx dagada! It works! Fantastic!

It works :) 
When you do that, you dont need any serial numbers."

,Dooly00000,2007-02-18T17:54Z,"I tried.  It works, but for some reason it does not go past three days for some reason.  It's very annoying removing and reinstalling."
,boyfrom75,2007-03-04T00:25Z,"Guys. I see this option everywhere in the internet. Peoples claim that this method works.  
Altering the ?application.sif? extension name doesn?t work !!
It only stop to run the registration window when photoshop starts. BUT is not a crack and is not a patch. Will NOT work !!
Only cracks and patches WORK.
There is no patch  for CS3 yet . We will have to wait a little more.
If the registration window stops to show doesn?t mean that CS3 is hacked . It will ask to register again in few days or when the trial period ends. 
In order to work, someone has to make a new  ?Photoshop.exe? patch,  and 2-3 more files in the Photoshop program folder  to get rid of trial. But I think the hackers  are waiting until Photoshop CS3  retail comes out to the stores, I do not think they will lose time hacking a trial at this time.
We just have to wait until the retail version comes out.!!
If a working patch comes out , It will be posted in here.
