In general, Neuronium is the New Age music project name of Michel Huygen since 1976. Sometimes accompanied with other artists like Carlos Guirao (1979 - 1981) and Santi Pic√≥ on guitars (1982) for a period of time. Some of the early works were (also) released on Michel's own record label Neuronium Records, which later became a more independent label in 2002.
