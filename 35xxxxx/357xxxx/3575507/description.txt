Cocaine Cowboys uses first hand testimony and footage from the the last 3 decades to provide a 
crAcking documentary detailing the exploits of the key figures of the era. It demonstrates how 
Miami especially became a key importation state which was initially used for hauling vast amounts 
of cannabis and later coca around the USA. 

Those interesting in narco-trafficking will find this film backs up the position that the Drug War 
is a sham, a false flag psi-op. We find at this level there exists no boundary between mafia and state 
- everyone has a price. We find also that illicit narcotics are an intrinsic element of an economy to 
the point where pulling this from global currency flows would lead to instant collapse.

This documentary also demonstrates the ongoing models used by the same covert ops teams which began shipping
 heroin in Asia in the Vietnam era and continued to cocaine in central and south america - leading to the 
Iran Contra situation. It's this same state mafia who were at the core of events on Septermber 11th 2001.
