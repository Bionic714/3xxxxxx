,jacobburke,2008-02-21T21:46Z,"@ downloading king

The two movies are included in this torrent.  For some reason they are bundled as the one movie, but in doing some research on the net, I found that the 2001 movie is the first two files and the Island of the Haunted is the last two files.

More information on The Pretender and the two movies here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pretender_(TV_series)"

Just a note to everyone not seeding:
The torrent system only works if leeches seed too."

Ah ,The Pretender.  A good , or sometis goof mixture of McGyver / Quantum Leap type small adventures. Small screen drama with decent acting considering the budget this series had. I liked it with it's little conspiracy, seeking the parents , trying to solve real life problems etc... Thanks for this excellent torrent, though the picture quality ain't that fancy, it gives this 'safe' vhs-screen that comforted me in childhood.. Also the existing good'ole' Dolby Soundtrack is nice to hear...

Video :6
Audio :7
Series : 9"
