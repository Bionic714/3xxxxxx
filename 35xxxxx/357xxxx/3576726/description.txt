"A Mighty Wind is a 2003 mockumentary about a folk music reunion concert and the three groups that must come together to perform on national television for the first time in years. The film was directed (and co-written) by prolific "mockumentarian" Christopher Guest. The title probably alludes to the folk standards Blowin' in the Wind and Wasn't That A Mighty Storm covered by many singers of the early '60s.
