I really loved this animated movie when I was a kid, and I accidentally erased it on VHS... Heh, it was around 13-15 years ago. And couldn't find it anywhere since then, still felt sorry from time to time) And now i can finally found it after all these years! Thanks again, I guess I'll seed it till the end of time after I'll finally get it ^^"

,xXGogetaXx,2008-09-25T00:18Z,"Oh wow. This is most certainly the pinnacle of nostalgia for me right now.
Thanks for upping this so much!"
,smmiller506,2008-09-25T16:33Z,"FYI: All you need to download for the actual movie are the files VTS_02_1.VOB through VTS_02_5.VOB. The other VOB files are menus, info files, and extras on the DVD menus. If you want the menus, also download VTS_01_0.VOB and VTS_02_0.VOB."
,smmiller506,2008-09-25T16:35Z,"Orizzle187, find and download VideoLAN Player (VLC). That program plays literally EVERYTHING."
,cupatcamp,2008-12-07T08:56Z,"hey does anyone know how or even if i can burn the files onto a dvd+r, so i can watch the movie on my dvd player?"
