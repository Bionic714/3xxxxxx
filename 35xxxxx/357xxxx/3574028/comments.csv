,JohnyFiama,2006-12-18T22:54Z,"I don't trust this thing because you never know exactly what you get! Why not just customizing a copy of Windows XP Pro by yourself? That way, at least, you will know for sure what is included in it.

Well, if you want a fully customized unattended copy of XP Pro, all you really need is A) the different components that you want to integrate into the image file (like the image file of Windows XP Pro, the Service Pack, the plugins, codecs, programs, etc.). B) A tool called ""nLite"" (http://www.nliteos.com/ - requires at least .NET Framework 2.0) which you use in order to customize/pre-configure/build the entire image with. C) Finally, just burn the image file you created with ""nLite"" with a burning application of your choice! I recommend ""Alcohol 120%"" because it is by far more reliable and less bloated than Nero and Roxio (totally useless). 

This way, you will certainly know what you get. And what the heck, you can even pre-configure the whole thing to have the product key integrated in it, so you don't have to type in the product key each time you install it on a machine. Very simple and efficient! :) 
You might wanna check the image by mounting it on a virtual drive (using tools like ""Alcohol 120%"" or ""Deamon Tools"") prior to burning it to see whether it works or not. Or, just installing it on a virtual PC. It's not as hard as it sounds and best of all: you get exactly what you ask for. "
,Gen4678,2006-12-19T02:20Z,"This file is a waist of time to download. Took a lot of time to fancy up the background on the install process but come on. What the hell is up with all the software????!! Seriously. You could have got the size down to at least 550MB if you would have threw out all that crap you put in there. 

Don't worry guys, I will upload Windows XP Pro with a working key for everyone. Since some people around here can't grasp the concept of simple. "
,zsi52,2006-12-19T06:38Z,"im usin nero 7 and it wont let me burn it ive tried buring it through boot disc setting and iso setting and it keeps on sayin the device is not ready, sumone please help "
,JohnyFiama,2006-12-19T10:44Z,"@zsi52: 

Just for your information...Nero is a piece-of-shit, unreliable, unstable, bloated, resource-hungry, and buggy crapware! Especially the latest version of it. The reason why I'm pointing this out is the fact that it has miserable failed me numerious times. If you are dealing with image files (like iso, img, gem, msd, bin, nrg, you name it!), I would highly recommend ""Alcohol 120%"" (shareware). It is very powerful and efficient..and best of all reliable."

@rimad_:
Well, of course it is easy to install an unattended copy of Windows XP like this one. At least, for those who have done it before. But the question is: Is it really worth with all the programs? Sure it is ""easy"" to uninstall softwares by using the built-in ""Add/Remove Programs"" feature from the Control Panel. But, what many people fail to realize is the fact that all softwares leave things behind (like registry keys/entries, files/folders) Well, unless if you have a hell of a good uninstallation strategy and the right tools/knowledge to perform a clean uninstallation, the problem will be solved. But, still I think it's stupid to have to uninstall something that you intentionally installed and didn't even need in the first place, as others here have pointed out indirectly. I'm not trying to be rude. It's just that I'm telling you guys what I believe is right from my own experiences. Furthermore, there is absolutely no offence aimed at ""newm0nk"" for doing is job of sharing his work with us, so he deserves to be credited for helping the torrent community to breathe, unlike those ass wads out there who cheat, spam or spread viruses and other sorts of malwares.
Finally, thanks ""Little Fingers"" for noticing. I had no idea of how beneficial the Student version of this OS is. Cheers! :)"

,phobos37,2007-11-10T22:10Z,"A number of people have referred to the Student Version which I think is ideal with its volume key.Having said that I recently put in a larger hard drive 200gg tobe precise but onfortunately the Student Version will as I have discovered from other colleagues will only recognise 120gg or less and to install it on a bigger hard drive needs a partition creating.
However if the Student Version had SP2 integrated that problem would be overcome.So anything which is bootable and has SP2 BUILT IN HAS TO BE WELCOMED.
Regretfully I have downloaded a number of these so called Bootable versions only to find they do not boot.Before I waste my time with this one DOES IT BOOT?????"
