The.O.C.S04E06.PROPER.HDTV.XviD-DIMENSION
Aired 07.12.2006
2pass XviD @ 993kbps
2ch Eng MP3 [48] @ 131kbps
Reason(s)- 
1.The G4L was left at 29.97 (no.ivtc) and thus
wasted bits on an extra 15000 frames plus the random
ghosting and other issues associated with not performing
an ivtc when necessary.
2. Not as bad but just as important, and still a "technical
flaw", they forgot to normalize the audio.
3. The other release was fake and contained the g4l one too, doh
G4L sample included
Sorry for the lateness, some dumbass passed out early :P
Enjoy :)
