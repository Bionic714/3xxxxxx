[V],Loske,2007-01-10T18:03Z,"The French and rest of the european countrys at least got something that the us aint got, brains and a history.

Next time you want to call a Frenchman coward, please read a non us history book first, idiot!"
,Irish_PXzyan,2007-01-30T22:54Z,"wow whos this idiot talking about the French being cowards and on about there past???

man..that was all in the past..where were you back then??? oh...wait..you perhaps wornt even alive..so thats non of your business.

Why do people resort to many years ago back in history and judge people because of history?? most french people now were not even alive back then and dont deserve your bullshit.

Personaly..I love French..got rid of the english for my people many years back.""iam Irish btw""
But I dont HATE the english...because non of them were alive or involved what all that..thats history.

To me..your one sad little retarded child..so shut your trap bud."

Please, you have just demonstrated that you are, in fact, the idiot. Brains have nothing to do with what country you come from and you have shown that you are terribly uneducated. Everyone is born with a brain, and the U.S.A. has had some of the finest. You have Thomas Edison to thank for electricity and all.

I am not a big fan of the French, because of the reasons that STONEDSTONER stated, although aodren14's fine work has led me to have a much better impression of them."
,Gr1zlY,2007-10-15T17:53Z,"Sorry, but this is not only French game... its also Ukrainian"
,Caspica,2007-11-20T19:23Z,"Silver_Sickle remember that Thomas Edison was ONE person and Europe has born a lot more than one.Heres some examples Albert Einstein, Madame Curie, Alfred Nobel and even Carl von Linne."
,Demurgeon,2007-11-20T21:08Z,Lolz. France sucks in general and thanks for bringing up two swedish geniuses.
