Synopsis:A veteran police officer becomes the chief when he passes a test given to all the members of the police force. The power of authority soon goes to his head as he treats his former chief with all the pompous rancor of a once-sniveling underling exacting revenge on his old boss. The comedy continues when the new chief meets his match when he marries and finds his wife to be far more demanding that anyone he could ever imagine. Louis De Funes stars as the lowly cop who soon becomes drunk with power in this engaging comedy marked by human humiliation and positioning for job advancement. ~ Dan Pavlides, All Movie Guide
