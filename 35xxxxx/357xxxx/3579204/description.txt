8 signs firewall are the best firewall ever anyways imo. 

it has feauteres like stealthing all ports except from one who remain closed.
allowing you to create tarpits (traps to trap hackers, worms and spammers) 
allowing you to block certain ip\\\'s effective if your\\\'e a p2p user
and much more

note to avg users if it says something about a trojan in the keygen simply just click move to vault
