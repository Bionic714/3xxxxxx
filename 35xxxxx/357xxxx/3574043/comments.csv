anyway..im trying to figure out how to download these ""turrent files""...or rather, how to open them...i click ""download turrent"" but i cant open it on my computer...please help...nothings making sence...=/"
,unrar,2006-12-10T05:01Z,"to download a ""torrent"" file, you must first find a bittorrent client, or a downloader. when you download the actual torrent file, it is just a set of directions to the real file. but you need a client to read the directions and download the file. i recommend azureus. remember, google is your friend... ;)"
,unrar,2006-12-10T05:02Z,"oh, yeah. you also have to use a modded xbox to play this game.... you sound a little confused. is your box modded?"
,Tcip,2006-12-11T06:07Z,You can use the best torrentprogram uTorrent (dl it here http://download.utorrent.com/1.6/utorrent.exe). Save it on your harddrive. Then download this torrent here http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/hashtorrent/3574043.torrent/Spawn_Armageddon.iso.3574043.TPB.torrent .Then draw the file in to utorrent =)
,AC*MILAN,2006-12-11T17:54Z,"it do not work, disc is either unknown or damaged, what do i have to do to make it work?"
,danthemanddd,2006-12-12T04:14Z,"It does work... 100% tested.. Do you have a modified xbox? how did you put the image on ur xbox? if you burned it, some xbox's wont read burnt discs, you can ftp it to ur xbox with a program called qwix.. i need more info from how you did it though"
,AC*MILAN,2006-12-12T14:59Z,"i used winrar that could not unpack it, but then i tried too use qwix anyway to transfer but it keeps saying language error, please help if u know how too make it work some other way,
thanks in advance"
,AC*MILAN,2006-12-12T15:54Z,"language txt error 65 and 67, help me pls"
,danthemanddd,2006-12-12T17:43Z,winrar wont recognize this iso.. or any xbox iso at that... are you sure you are ftp-ing into it correctly? you can also burn the image with a program like nero.. write the image at 8x or slower though
,AC*MILAN,2006-12-12T18:17Z,"i have used winrar for almost two years and it have always worked, is there any other program that can unpack it because when i use winrar it says no item selected and qwix says language error, any other advice than burning?"
,*namaste*,2006-12-13T18:43Z,thanks a lot for this
,danthemanddd,2006-12-14T06:11Z,DUDE DO NOT UNPACK IT.... IT IS AN XBOX IMAGE THEREFORE A COMPUTER WILL NOT RECOGNIZE IT... try sticking a xbox game in ur dvd drive.. same thing... have have to use a program MEANT to read xbox iso's such as QWIX or C-XBOX TOOLS!!!!!
,AC*MILAN,2006-12-14T14:57Z,"sorry man stupid me forget to wrote one little dot in the ip address, sorry it works perfectly, keep up the work hehe."

,SoundWall,2006-12-19T21:55Z,"unrar,

Azureus is sooo crappy. It eats resources like some intestine virus and corrupts your files.

I recommend uTorrent or BitLord."

,Kazoka,2007-01-23T08:30Z,OK so Im REAL new at this and was wondering if there was a guide to a) burning a game to disc or b) ftping a .iso to the xbox so it will show as a playable  game in my dashboard. Thanks in advance!!
