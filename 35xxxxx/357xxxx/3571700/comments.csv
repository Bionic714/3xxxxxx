,SuperTedNorway,2006-12-06T19:10Z,How do I install these maps ?
,Dusha,2006-12-06T21:46Z,"Maps appears to be FAKE!!!!
All files are dated with 2005 year and the size is smaller then WE v6.52 released earlier this year."
,fransfl,2006-12-07T01:15Z,This is NOT a fake and the date means NOTHING (in fact you can modify the date of files as you know...).
,rimad_,2006-12-07T02:39Z,How do you explain the size then? WE 6.52 is 867.81 MiB..zipped.
,fransfl,2006-12-07T10:35Z,"Try it, watch the updates! Don't say stupid things, it's true goddamit."
,fransfl,2006-12-07T10:45Z,"I have to ask one thing to the partecipants of this torrent: do NOT say BULLSHITS! This map is TRUE, just try it, use it and watch the updates tomtom has made with roads, interections, etc. You'll notice that the map is of 10/2006, FULL PERIOD."
,rimad_,2006-12-07T13:17Z,"watch the roads? what? I don't think anyone will be able to tell the difference, there is probably a few streets fixed somewhere heh and still i don't get it how updated version could be smaller than previous. And don't you...period me :))"
,dyrefoto,2006-12-07T21:10Z,how to I activat this map?
,bjoeern,2006-12-08T20:41Z,"I just bought my tomtom with an scandiavian map and want to use this.. 

Can i crack my software or can i get an keygen for the activation code?"
,stevepick,2006-12-10T17:41Z,"The version looks identical to the one TomTom tries to selle to my TomTom 5. Is there a way to downgrade it to version 5 ?

Thanks for the ul"
,Smurf1969,2006-12-10T18:53Z,"I checked the italian changes applied to my Italy map (http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3571835/Italy___MRE_v660.1219_for_TomTom_Navigator_6) and they are the same! And this is NOT the Navteq map for TTN Rider (which is awful) but a real TeleAtlas! Only differences are less ""unnamed roads""...
To unlock it on my PalmOS pda I used http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3573778/Tt6_Kg_4_c4Pda_-_Keygen_Tomtom_6_Mobile.zip"
,bjoeern,2006-12-10T22:58Z,"I use a TomTom one .. how do i unlock?

,miomirk,2006-12-16T13:31Z,My TomTom One does not accept the activation code that gets created with the KeyGen mentioned below that is for PDAs. Anyone else with the code for TomTom One? It would be greatly appreciated.

,bjoeern,2006-12-28T19:07Z,"Its easy!

follow these steps:

1)make a folder in C:\ to make it easier, call it keygen.
2)Put your .mid file in there and Key.exe in there.
3)Now open command prompt ""Start-Programs-Accessories-command prompt
4)Then type as follows cd C:\ [Press Enter]
5)now you wiill have C:\> in command prompt.
6)Then type: cd keygen : You will then see c:\keygen>
7) Then type : Key.exe western_europe.mid :
Don't forget the space between .exe and western.
8)then put in your code ID and then enter.

You get your ID by selecting Change map on yuour GPS and choose to activate manually"

,roozjee80,2007-01-14T04:21Z,"Hello,

I've been trying for several days now, to install the map Western Europe v6.60 build 1219 onto my TomTom One v1.

Does the famous key.exe actually work for this combination of hardware and map??? TomTom One (version 1) and Map WE 6.60 build 1219.

I keep reading that people succeed in doing this on a TomTom One, but it's not often clear if that's a v2 or v1.

My TomTom keeps on telling me that the activation code is wrong.

Did anyone of the readers of this post succeed in using the keygenerator on a TomTom One v1 with the Western Europe map 6.60 build 1219?

Thanks for helping!

,chefare,2007-01-21T22:41Z,I think Build 1219 is for Tomtom one v2 or v1 upgraded to 6.xx
,iansnaz,2007-04-22T15:19Z,i have ipaq 5555 with tomtom 6 from ifalleni already installed and put these maps onto my sd card and hey presto no problems at all works brilliantly Many Many thanks
,dobbyone,2007-04-28T19:52Z,"It actually looks newer than the 1409 (the street on which I live does not appear in 1409), also to the same destination i get different distances and times. But which POIs are better (newer), can anyone tell?

PS: On tomtom 6.030 works without problems."
,Phfrangckque,2007-06-18T22:43Z,"Hi guys,

Can anyone tell me how to install this map (on a HTC 3300 with pockets windows and a working TomTom with a map of Amsterdam)? 

I know how to use the keygen, but TomTom does not see the map when I try to put it on my PDA....

Thanx!"
