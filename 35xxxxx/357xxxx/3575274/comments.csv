If you want to know more, I suggest to pick these .torrent files also:

And finally, a detailed and irreverent analysis of the above, based on logic and Islamic sources:

Stop the killing. Other religions have stopped the mass killing! hundreds of years ago.

1 reason moslims will never role the world is because the level of education is to low. A nother reason is that some moslims are just very short side. A economie cant be run the extreem moslim way!

He how will kill will go to hell if he is not sorrie about it ad his and! You go to you're personal hell.

If you read this leurn first how you should read and anderstand what you read! dont have a hate full person tell it to you!

Go in peace. God/Allah will judge you in the and"

Wow. I know that Muslim scholars claim that the Bible, Torah & all have been systematically corrupted to remove all references to Muhammad, Mecca, Allah etc. - a position contradicted by all historical evidence we have.

Still, the amount of twisting that Islam needs to do in order to make the Bible predict Muhammad is amazing. Look at the amount of words needed to change the story from its original intent and purpose! 

Actually, I find it quite telling that Islam needs to do stuff like this to legitimize Muhammad. Islamic scholars must be seriously worried about the evidence they have when they need to do this :)"

,farringr,2007-01-09T06:13Z,"I BROUGHT a copy of the koran from waterstones, against my better judgement (the paying for it)

I've not read it all, but it's a bit ranty and, well Grrrr

There seems to be a threat on every page.

I think that people beliving that this is the literal truth is a very scary thing, possibly worse that the foaming at the mouth evangelicals.

still it's interesting to try to see where people are coming from. 

read 'the god delusion' if you're a beliver, it may open your eyes."

That's a good one, my brother gave it to me for Christmas. Even better is ""The End of Faith"", which i recently bought. Throughoutly scientific, it examines the phenomenon of faith and fundamentalism through the ages and suggest, well, growing up..."
,mohcandy,2007-02-14T15:17Z,"thanks so much, frodo.  I'm very curious about this religion.
this looks like a good way to start learning. "
