,DewDude,2008-11-21T02:06Z,"a lower than expected quality release.

six pack of judd obviously missing track 2 and also a 96kbps rip.

cledus country is obviously a mutt rip with varying quality files.

average bitrate of albums really not impressive....most files exhibit a lot of mp3 noise.

some track rips aren't perfect.

extra tracks aren't by cledus except nascar races:

gin & juice cover is by the gourds

will the real slim shady please shut up is done by hollywood hamilton.

still better than not having these tracks....still hope to replace them with even better quality mp3s."
