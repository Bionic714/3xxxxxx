Review:
-------
?I envision a certain depth, an experience of sound that gives space for the
listener to repose. My goal is to combine the elements of space and romance,
creating a delicate backdrop to the soul.? This is the philosophy that has
propelled composer/producer Jonn Serrie to the forefront of the contemporary
instrumental and space music field. Serrie?s imaginative playing and visionary 
compositional skills have revolutionized today?s contemporary electronic
music. He creates a unique approach by combining the timelessness of space
with the exhilaration of love, all within the sanctuary of Planet Earth.

Serrie?s premier release, And the Stars Go With You, is a journey into the
depths of deep space. He was later selected by the planetarium industry to
compose the music for NASA's Teacher in Space program of the mid-80?s.
Serrie?s recorded works include Century Seasons, Hidden World, Flightpath,
Tingri, compilation albums of music from his various planetarium projects
entitled Planetary Chronicles Volume 1 and Volume 2, and many other fine
works. 

His previous album, Epiphany, Meditations on Sacred Hymns, returns him
to his spiritual and musical roots. The arrangements are soft and gentle, 
perfect for contemplative listening. In addition to compositions for What The
Bleep Do We Know!? and David Carradine?s Tai Chi series, Serrie has composed
music for George Lucas and the Hayden Planetarium in New York City; PBS, the
Discovery Channel, the U.S. Navy Blue Angels, and created a unique presentation
of educational narrative and live music with NASA astronaut Story Musgrave
called ?Space Stories.? His music has been heard in London, Munich, Sweden,
Japan, China, Canada, South America and Australia. He recently completed a
project with IMAX Corporation and the Space Telescope Science Institute on a
feature film about the discovery of Deep Field galaxies beyond the known
universe. ?My music exists to help us explore a sense of ourselves and our
place in the universe?.
