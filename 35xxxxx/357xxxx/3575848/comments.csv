,Construction-Worker,2011-06-03T10:52Z,"Will someone please seed? When I started downloading this file, I got some really fast speeds
Then suddenly the speed turns to 0 and have been like that for days now. I'm only at 85% so I would like someone to seed it.

Also when I got the high speeds there were no seeders. How is that possible? Can I download from peers without seeders?"
