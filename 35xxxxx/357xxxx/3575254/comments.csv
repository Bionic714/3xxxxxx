,Greeno225,2008-06-24T02:31Z,Actually Dr. Friedman and the Chicago boys saved the economy of Chile that had being destroyed by Allende`s marxist reforms.
,mrfr0st,2011-10-25T00:44Z,"Actually, considering that actions remarkably similar to Friedman's preachings completely shredded the Icelandic economy, I'd say that braskamin was right and vindicated in this case. As it happens, Iceland's slow and painful recovery is entirely due to leftist ideals and policies. You Greeno225 are neither a gentleman nor a scholar... you are sadly an uninformed idiot."
