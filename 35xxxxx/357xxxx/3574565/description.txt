A CyberBears Production
Featuring: Daddy Beare, David De Jesus, Eric Bear, Goatee Dude, Kj Behr, Manuel, Papi Kulo, Tucker CodyDirector: Ken Slater, Producer: Mike Zillion

When the bears aren't out in the woods, you can usually find them messing around in the Bear Barn!

Watch Eric Bear show Tucker Cody a thing or two behind the woodshed. The straw flies all over before these two are done.

Then David De Jesus, who's done some outrageous backstage scenes on earlier CyberBears DVD's, makes his feature premiere as a solo performer, followed by another solo from bear hottie Ray Wood.

Finally, four bears in a barn equals more meat than you can shake a stick at! Watch Daddy Bear E and KJ Bear top Goatee Dude and Manuel every which way.

Pull up a bale, and kick back for this nonstop hayride!
