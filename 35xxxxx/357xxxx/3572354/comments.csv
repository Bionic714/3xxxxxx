,gua-no,2006-12-07T12:17Z,Thanx! Been looking for this for a long time!
[V],Kefissos,2006-12-07T12:34Z,Gua-no: I did'nt have any idea people would download alternative music from 4AD records. Now I can see I was wrong! Thats why I upload lot of music from 4AD records :-)
[V],iggy.stooge,2006-12-07T13:45Z,Great upload and a band too few are aware of! Ladykillers are one of the best songs I know of! Thanks! :)
[V],Kefissos,2006-12-07T14:46Z,Thx. I have just right now upload The Brreders (4AD)
,Resurrection,2006-12-08T02:25Z,Thank you Kefissos for your great uploads! You don´t happen to have The Telescopes? That´s another band from the shoegaze-era that didn´t get the attention they deserved...
[V],Kefissos,2006-12-08T11:16Z,"Resurrection: I do have The Telescope, but you have to wait for a while. I have other music to upload...;-)"
[V],Kefissos,2006-12-09T00:47Z,"I have already deleted an upload of the band Lush...sorry Guys, its your own fault, if you can't seed."
,extrudedplasticdingus,2006-12-09T06:52Z,"Oh man.  Somebody please seed this?  All my shoegaze stuff got stolen back in 1998.  Kefissos, I seeded your Slodive torrent to a ratio of 39.55 and your Belly torrent to over 9.  Throwing muses, over 7."

,phineasEnRetard,2009-11-28T21:39Z,"Kefissos.  Right here, in this moment, I'll have to profess my love for you; for your diligence (because i know this is somewhat difficult work and often thankless), for your selflessness (your ability to share a collection that has more than likely taken you quite some time to amass).  

I'm forever grateful...i'd even go so far as to kiss you were you not a bloody ocean away!  Oh, and trust that i'll seed!"
[V],Kefissos,2010-01-17T03:49Z,"@ phineasEnRetard
