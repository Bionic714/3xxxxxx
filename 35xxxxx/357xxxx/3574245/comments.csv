Just so a complete noob in this can hang on. How do I get the Webstyler to get rid of the $ in the templates. a step by step, please :-)
I can get the program to accept the templates, but then the ""edit"" buttons dont work??
What am I doing wrong?"

I'm happy you like the path.

,clitoris,2007-07-25T15:00Z,Xara Menu Maker v1.1 is not the full version even when the padlock crack is use. I have used the crack and the software and its like in Demo Mode. You can only use a set number of Menu Bars... If you try to use any of the good looking menus it tells you to go buy the software. DAM
