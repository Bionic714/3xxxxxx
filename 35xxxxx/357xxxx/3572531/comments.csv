,Duffalo,2007-06-29T20:06Z,"so the patch worked fine for me, but I can only play for about 15 mins before the game ""unexpectedly closes"". has anyone else had this problem?"
,icarusone,2007-07-31T07:25Z,anyone know where I can find a crack for v2.13 of the game???
,CRASH1SG0D,2007-09-24T07:45Z,"This is genius. Why don't you make a program that removes the DVD check on any program? So that you wouldn't have to make anymore, for other games."
,CRASH1SG0D,2007-09-24T07:45Z,"So that you wouldn't HAVE to make anymore, I mean."
,CRASH1SG0D,2007-09-26T07:32Z,"Jesus Christ! I know it wasn't intentional, but this patch is a piece of shit. I finally got around to trying it and it totally fucked up my game. I couldn't even uninstall it or reinstall warlords over it, no, I had to use AppZapper to uninstall ALL the Civ4 files on my computer then reinstall everything. This program is really bad, I've tested the Stubbs NoCD by the same company and it's great, but you need to take this down and do some serious reprogramming. I am using the 24"" iMac.
Mac OS X 10.4.10
CPU Processor INTEL
CPU Speed: 2.16 GHz
Memory: 2 GB
HD Space: 174.91 GB out of 232.57 GB (After installation of Civ4 and Warlords)
Video Card (NVidia) GeForce 7300
Video Memory: 128 MB
Plus my DVD Drive which is required for the game.

As you can see my computer is WELL equipped for this game, but with this patch the game runs EXTREMELY slow and civs have ? for pictures and objects are blacked out and it causes my comp to crash. To see the Minimum and Recommended REquirements for the game use the Aspyr Game Agent.

WHATEVER YOU DO DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS PATCH!!"
,CRASH1SG0D,2007-09-26T08:02Z,"Shit, maybe it was intended. This is bull shit, I deleted thousands of files relating to Civilization and reinstalled it. I can't play without the CD, the version says 2.0 and I can't install the RevB patch for Warlord, and it still glitches. If anyone knows how to get this thing off let me know."
,CRASH1SG0D,2007-09-26T08:16Z,"I figured it out, but this patch really sucks. I really do not recommend installing this patch. It's so much better with the game."
,NoFreakinTorious,2008-07-03T08:20Z,everytime i try 2 open it quits unexpectedly cuz it has no image or somethin like that wat am i supposed 2 do?
,cieguito,2008-10-07T22:06Z,"this works perfectly in a ppc g5 10.4.11 with the expansion posted in this same site. 
leopard i dont know"
,SpudsBM,2009-08-24T05:34Z,"this patch works perfectly you just have to know how to do it :                                                  Original post by

To make things easier, a compiled list of how to make this work on Leopard:

After you mount the main game files, now what is left to do is to apply the updates and warlords patches. The cracks that are included with them arent the ones that are the drag, drop and replace. These are applications that ""patch"" the existing executable files. So in order that these ""patches"" can work, you need to give them permission to fuck around:

1. Right click on the civ4 warlords executable and choose SHOW PACKAGE CONTENTS
2. Right click on CONTENTS and choose GET INTO
3. At the bottom of the panel should be a lock. click the lock, type in the password, and then change ALL of the options to READ AND WRITE
4. Then click the gear-like tool on the very bottom and choose apply to enclosed, then click OK in the confirmation dialog.

Now, the patches themselves need to be edited to properly execute. We need to update their iPatcher to fix them. To fix the crack patchers so they work on Leopard (same procedure on both patches):

1. Download the latest iPatch from ipatch.org.
2. Mount the downloaded iPatch dmg, right-click the iPatch app, choose ""SHOW PACKAGE CONTENTS"".
3. Locate ""Contents/Resources/iPatcher"" (448 K), right-click it and choose ""SHOW PACKAGE CONTENTS"".
4. Locate ""Contents/MacOS/iPatcher"" (212 K).
5. COPY it.

6. Copy the patches from the .dmg to your harddrive so they can be modified. I keep them with the executables they are going to patch.
7. Right-click on a patch, choose ""Show package contents"", locate the file ""Contents/MacOS/iPatcher"" (208 K)
8. Replace (PASTE) the file from the iPatch download ""iPatcher"" (212 K) over the ""iPatcher"" (208 K) in the crack patch.
9. Launch the crack, it should not crash if you did it right (obviously).
10. Run the crack and drag the warlords game executable into the crack to patch it.
11. Run the game"
