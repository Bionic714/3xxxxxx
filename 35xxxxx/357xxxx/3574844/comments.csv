,McLintock,2007-04-28T00:45Z,Can I Do The Subs? 
,McLintock,2007-04-28T22:03Z,pls help! how can i use the subs?
,Sardanaphalus,2007-06-26T12:28Z,"Time to remake this film with more substance (haha), better lead than Heston, and perhaps more from original story."
,BigFuze,2008-03-25T06:25Z,thanks
,ktsmurf,2008-04-07T09:17Z,"For its time, this movie is a fantastic sociopolitical satire. Also, better lead than Heston? Are you high? This movie would have sucked without him. He can chew scenery like few others. He's practically Shatnerian in his screen presence. "
[T],Huggybaby,2008-06-02T02:44Z,"Better lead than Heston?

You mean they should get a real actor like Will Smith? Make me fucking laugh! Heston was a god!"
,giggedyguy,2008-06-13T01:56Z,"I hope Steven Spielberg does a remake with this. The sound effects like in War of the Worlds could add a lot more creepiness to this story. Great film, only Heston film I ever liked him in. "
,orgpunk,2008-06-25T18:18Z,"Heston is great.
It's because of that fat turd Michael Moore people with no brains that can't judge for them selfs are going around and say stuff about decent people."
,Ekiph,2008-06-29T21:18Z,Soylent green is PEOPLE!
,quazgaa,2008-07-20T13:07Z,im noticing how many spoiler comments there are...are you people dumb or just gay? maybe some people havent seen this before.
,meco64,2008-07-23T23:11Z,"I am also unable to load the subtitles. I have unpacked the RAR file, but loading the .sub file in BS Player does nothing. There is also the .idx file which has subtitles time codes. How do I load that?"
,SaorEire,2008-08-30T14:48Z,"Someone like Michael Moore advocating hillbillies mongoloids like Heston aren't waving guns around hasn't the brains?

Logic used to be common place, once upon a time. You mutants probably shot it to shit."
,Ringrat,2008-12-14T21:18Z,"""It's people! It's people! Soylent Green is people! Aaaahhh!"" 

Thanks a lot... :(

I was actually planing on watching this!"
,natandty,2009-01-03T21:07Z,"Quit bellyaching about people ruining it for others. This movie has been around long enough, if you haven't heard that quote before, you live under a rock.  They used it in the show Millenium. It was their voice recognition login for the computer systems. 

Watch it and enjoy.

Thanks for the d/l"

,nicodog,2009-02-24T15:05Z,"Wow, lot of seeders for an old movie. I've never seen this yet (I'm too young to have seen it on screen). Looks like it's quite enjoyable.

Thanks a lot for seeding this."

[V],vtwin88cube,2009-08-26T06:31Z,Thanks for the movie.
,Joxman2k,2009-11-25T23:31Z,"This would be an awesome remake, but you can't replace the original. Heston will always ROCK."
,Lord_Kongol,2009-12-21T22:03Z,"Thanks to everyone that ruined the end for me.  You're all a bunch of assholes!!!  Because of you, now I won't have the same experience you did when first watching this.  And, most likely, this will lead me to being unimpressed by what could've been a great movie to me.  Once again, thanks a lot you fucking morons."
,bikerbish,2010-03-24T18:27Z,"Heston is one of the best American actors, when they need better, they have to use UK actors"
,bikerbish,2010-03-24T18:28Z,"Sorry, thanks BhangWalla"
,Armydillo,2010-03-25T05:20Z,"Lord Kongol, like natandy said, if youdidn't know it ended that way, then you have absolutely no connection whatsoever to the outside world."
[V],mrspatula,2010-05-12T17:27Z,Thanks for the upload :)
,Mihawk01,2010-06-07T21:00Z,"You're all dumbass. Even if it's a very famous movie, and that everyone probably know the end. Some people don't and they don't need spoilers. what's the use anyway to spoil it like that? It's just to piss some people off.
And I'm not american, and though even here it's famous too, people under like 30 don't know all the classics. So i didn't know it, and thanks to some douche, i know the end now, there's like no point seeing it anymore. But i will anyway since it's a great movie from what i've read.

And Heston is a stupid fuck like a lot of southern american, the fact that he was a great actor doesn't change anything about that. Like michael jackson and kids. We still love his music. Here the movies, but beside that Heston was dumb."
,jpk601,2010-08-15T16:57Z,Thank you :)
,capturetwist,2010-11-08T01:55Z,"How do I use the subs on VLC, please someone answer cause I do not know anything about those codes. I am newbi, please someone help me! "
