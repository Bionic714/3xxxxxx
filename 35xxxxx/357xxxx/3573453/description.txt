Isenseven, Germanys most popular fun-snowboard crew, is back: Next to the already established crew of Basti Kuhn, Marco Smolla, Chris Patsch, Vinzenz Lüps, Alex Rieger, Christophe Schmidt, Andre Tröltzsch, Alex Wottrich, André Kuhlmann and Flo Bürgel, "Prediculous" is featuring the newbie Michi Zirngibl and the Norweigan trio Fredrik Evensen, HC Bergheim and Erik Botner this year.
The shoots in the USA, Norway, Canada, Andorra, Switzerland, Austria, the Czech Repuplic and back home in Germany made this season one of our most amusing yet. In addition to a bunch of snow schralping you can look forward to a lot of the typical fun Isen7 stuff ? put together with high-class post-production and lovely editing with music that you?ll love.
