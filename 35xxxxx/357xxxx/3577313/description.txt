the appropriate christmas is an ambient audio mix of some 2400 christmas tracks that i've downloaded over the years. the collection is mostly compromised of albums published in the english speaking world, although there are exceptions (most notably swedish albums).

having grown up with the image of christmas being an all-family happy happening, i'm one of those people bitter about promises never fullfilled, presents never delivered, families never being what they should be. there's a reason why the suicide rate is it's highest during christmas, and maybe by listening to the ambience of christmas destilled it's possible to get a distance to all the expectations. or maybe it just further drives you into a delerium.

many of the songs have been downloaded through either tpb or other torrent sites, so i thought it would be a good idea to present them in the same forum.
