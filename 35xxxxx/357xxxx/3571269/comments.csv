,nalle69,2007-01-30T23:17Z,"I'm done seeding this... someone else
should make the effort on this one now....

My ratio on this is now up to 11.800
I have seeded 5,29GB...  This release is
a really good one and actually working :o)

Just download, unrar and then burn all files
from folder ""UT_CD1"" to a CD-R.

Run the CD-R for installation and when you
are done install ""utpatch436creative.exe""

No CD protection or shit like that (too old game
for that shit ;o).. play singel player or even
 multiplayer online...

 Many thanks to Leathal for this up... :)"
