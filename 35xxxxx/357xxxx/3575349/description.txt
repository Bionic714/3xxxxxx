Global Scenery of Moscow (MGS). Only for MSFS 2004.
MGS involves 3 airports:
- the international airport ?Sheremetyevo?;
- the short-haul and private flights aerodrome ? ?Tushino?;
- the commercial aerodrome at Khodynka field called ?Central?,
and, of course, the city of Moscow scenery itself, which is created with the particular care basing on 10 000 photos. For those, who have never been to Moscow, this highly detailed scenery gives an opportunity to become acquainted with this great and beautiful megapolice, making fascinating air trips over the city and seeing its main places of interest. And those, who were in Moscow before, or Muscovites would be pleasantly surprised, noticed how MGS is close to the real.
