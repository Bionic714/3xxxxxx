,joke76,2007-09-09T18:22Z,"just noticed that ""The Yellow Shark"" is missing several tracks though...there may be others missing but I haven't noticed it yet."
,staern,2008-02-28T17:37Z,Det går inte att komma åt filen. Vad har hänt?
,staern,2008-03-16T22:23Z,"I´ve tried several times to get this file but it´s impossible! Every time I get this message: ""Trouble accessing files, no such file or directory"". What´s the meaning of uploading a file that does not work??? Right now there are 50 distr. and 63 recip. and the file is not working. I have never had any problems with downloading files on PB!"
,Ignition1,2008-03-23T22:05Z,"this is one amazing torrent!!!


BUT i miss ""we're only in it for the money"" & ""one size fits all"" which is like the coolest albums ever from him! 

thank you so much for sharing this..."
,staern,2008-04-18T23:37Z,"Nice upload really! But some of the albums are incomplete! ""Tinseltown Rebellion"" and ""Zappa In New York, for example. I think there might be some more albums that don´t have all songs that should be included. Well, you can buy the missing songs on the web and put them where they belong. Not a big problem!

Thank you anyway!"
