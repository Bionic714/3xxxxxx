,Garlack,2006-12-13T18:20Z,"nice, as promised i'm seeding -are those other sections in the pipe work? can't wait to get my hands on Wings again:)"
,dacke_77,2006-12-15T19:29Z,"I will seed this one awhile longer, since my upload is so crappy two seeds is enough. But I will upload the rest. But I just got N to S left. But as Wings is one of my alltime favorite I have downloaded it and will upload it in the N to S package. Just for you Garlack ;)"

,Garlack,2006-12-18T18:40Z,"thanks, much appreciated:) you surely are a man of fine taste.

,Garlack,2006-12-26T15:37Z,"dude like i'm totaly dreaming about playing wings again, last night i litrally dreamed the whole game - earning my wings, writeing my journal about the airbase in luxumberg i've been posted too.  Wow its been like over five years since i had an amiga!  Strafeing the train, bombing factorys and dogfighting the red barron before the glory of VE day, the news paperheadlines declareing the end of the war - I don't even remember my last girlfriend as well as this game and certainly not with such walm feeling :)  

So yeah er, i don't want to rush you but whens the next section comeing -the one with wings in:) 

Been playing loads of these games, great collection -lure of the temptress is a great game:) KGB and of corce ol Lesure suit Larry, the amiga OWNED point and click. yeah scumm might have had a few good un's but the amiga OWNED.

so cheers for the set so far:)"

,RUSKYUK,2007-10-02T20:59Z,"Hi People i'm looking for a game on the amiga but I can't remember its name if I discribe it as best as I can i'm hoping someone will know what its called, here we go:-

Its a single screen game Ie doesn't move around with the player when it moves like in zool, its a two player game were you each control a by-plane one starting in each corner on the ground. You are seperated by a biulding in the middle so you can't kill each other straight away and the object of the game is to shot each other and just have fun.

From RUSKYUK"
,muks_nz,2007-10-05T21:55Z,"RUSKYUK, The game I believe you are after is called bi-planes or something along those lines...it was awesome! brings back the memories...thanks for that!

"
,RUSKYUK,2007-10-07T20:26Z,"cheers muks i googled the game name and found the game i'm looking for, its called bip or also biplane duel.
