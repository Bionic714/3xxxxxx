Q. CAN I PLAY THESE WITH AN EMULATOR? WHAT EMULATOR DID YOU USE?

A. NO YOU CAN NOT PLAY THESE WITH AN EMULATOR

Q. WELL IF I CANT PLAY WITHOUT AN EMULATOR THAN HOW THE HELL AM I GOING TO PLAY IT?

A. YOU BUY A FRIGGIN PSP. AND THEN YOU HACK THE S.O.B.

Q. ARE YOU RETARDED HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DO THAT?

A. NO IM NOT RETARDED! USE THE FOLLOWING LINK TO PUT CUSTOM FIRMWARE ON YOUR PSP. AND DO ME A FAVOR AND READ THIS THING OVER A FEW TIMES BEFORE YOU SCREW UP YOUR PSP!

IF YOU PUT CFW ON YOUR PSP YOU WILL HAVE TO BUY A NEW BATTERY AFTER. AND DO NOT DOWNLOAD GAMES UNLESS YOU OWN THEM.

Q. ONCE I HAVE PUT CFW ON MY PSP. HOW DO I PLAY THE GAMES?

A. THERE SHOULD BE A ISO FOLDER IN YOUR ROOT FOLDER OF YOUR PSP. PUT THE .ISO'S AND .CSO'S IN THERE!

HERE YOU GO GUYS!
