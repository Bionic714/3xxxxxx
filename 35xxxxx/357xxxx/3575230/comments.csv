VLC 0.8.5 had such many flaws. If you selected 16:9 then you didn't get 16:9 at all, but something totally different... The horrible thing is many people don't even realized that (plus other stuff) and just continued using it.

I was about to give up hope about VLC since it was stuck on a flawed version for so long."
