The seed is actually really slow.  I will try to seed for a few weeks. :)"
,pstudios,2007-02-18T06:42Z,"I downloaded the original rar awhile back.  Nice music, but 1/2 the songs are missing from the rubia album"
,keramida,2008-07-06T22:24Z,"Nice music, indeed.  It doesn't cost much in terms of bandwidth here, so I'll leave it seeding for days or weeks.

Thanks for the upload! :-)"

,Unix_123,2010-10-22T10:47Z,"I downloaded this torrent and found that the Magic Touch album has not the right songs that belong to its album, all the songs belong to other albums so i had to delete them because they were included in the others albums of this torrent. In regard to the Rubia album i found that it has just 5 songs out of the 12 that were included in the album."
,Unix_123,2010-10-22T11:01Z,"The album Isla del Sol are missing 5 songs out of 12 which are  2,3,6,7, and 11.
The album Gypsy Flame are missing the songs # 4, 7, and 11.
The album Rain Dancer is missing the song # 5 which is wrongly named as Rain dancer but in fact when you play it it is  the Concierto de Aranjuez.
The album Rosas del amor is recorded in 192Kbps"
