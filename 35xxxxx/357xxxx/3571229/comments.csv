,shenkeee,2006-12-08T12:20Z,"I don't know exactly what is the problem

Perhaps it's already installed in your BW...

Try unlock your database (if you have not unlock code, I can share it); and after that run the update files again (first the rev1_lsjm_7015t_base.pbn !).

Good luck!"

Please share it!

Thanks"

I guess your torrent lacks the most important thing: the file itself!!! 

IMHO the 2 .pbn files seem to be only the updating files that connect the full LSJM file to the BibleWorks servers for it to be updated and nothing more.
As a matter of fact, they both can also be easily downloaded FREE OF CHARGE from the BibleWorks site (in case you have problems with direct upgrading from the program menu).

To cut a long story short, we cannot update a file if we physically haven't got that file!!!

I've tried my best to figure out which extension might have a BibleWorks, but couldn't: certainly not .pbn.
I've seen that for the moment the LSJM Module can only be bought by downloading the file(s) and the instructions they send you via e-mail............. so please ""torrent-ize"" everything they've sent you.

Please reply and correct me if I'm wrong!

Cheers!"
