The man behind Synergy is Larry Fast a native of New Jersey who 
was to have a far-reaching effect on the use of synthesizers in rock 
music during the seventies and eighties.

Larry Fast first came to prominence with the release of the debut 
album from Synergy called Electronic Realizations For Rock Orchestra 
in 1975. Prior to the release of Synergy's debut Larry Fast had been 
at college. Initially Larry trained as a violinist and pianist before 
entering college and taking a few computer science courses. It was 
during this period that Larry Fast became interested in synthesized 
music and began to build his own synthesizers. At this time he was 
introduced to Rick Wakeman at a local radio station and both 
musicians enjoyed an immediate rapport with Larry Fast interesting 
Rick Wakeman in his home made instruments and his customizing of 
existing synthesizers. He was invited over to England to assist with the 
synthesizers on the Yes album Tales From Topographic Oceans. 
Shortly after this Larry Fast gained a record contract, which saw the 
beginning of Synergy and the subsequent release of the debut album 
which received plaudits from no lesser person than Robert Moog 
himself who at the time claimed the album to be "the most important 
recording using his Moog synthesizer". Soon after the release of the 
debut Synergy album Larry Fast was introduced to Peter Gabriel who 
at the time had just left Genesis to embark on a solo career and Larry 
was invited by Gabriel to help with the synthesizer work on Peter's 
series of self titled solo albums. During this time Larry also worked as 
part of Peter Gabriel's live band and performed on many sessions for 
diverse artists including Foreigner, Kate Bush, Art Garfunkel, Hall and 
Oates and The Fugees in addition to recording and releasing albums 
with Synergy. During the eighties Larry Fast also moved into film work 
scoring the films About Last Night and Planes, Trains and Automobiles. 

Audion was the fifth album to come from Synergy and was originally 
released in 1981. It was the follow up album to Games although this 
album has a more rock feel than the structured feel of the previous 
album. The album contains ten tracks although again no guitars are 
present on this recording. Tracks include Orbit Five, Electric Blue and 
An End To History and with all the albums in this series of re issues 
has been re mastered and contains sleeve notes by Larry Fast.
