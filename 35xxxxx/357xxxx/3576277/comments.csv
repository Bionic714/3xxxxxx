,Pearly*,2006-12-14T01:13Z,Seems the .rar files are false somehow. Am I right?
,Pearly*,2006-12-14T01:29Z,"Downloading this is waste of time. Checksums for rzr-f071.004 are obviously false. 080548c2, originally 87def612. New proper?"
,zappe,2006-12-14T13:50Z,"i don't know what your are talking about?

these files are all okey and no crcs at all."
,mAIJK,2006-12-14T14:11Z,This works.. Stop talk shit plz
,Pearly*,2006-12-14T14:21Z,"Oh please forgive my stupidness. I must obviously hallucinate, since the fourth .rar is totally fucked. Or did someone purposely shit that file just for me? Please, prove my shit talk wrong."
,zappe,2006-12-14T15:18Z,since it's working for everyone else you should prolly check your own connection.
