piracy is not steeling :D ---  ((sweden))"
,osse93,2006-12-13T18:50Z,doe's it work to burn gamecube games??

Yeah, just use a XenoGC or DUOQ chip, and wire it to the contact points on your DVD laser assembly.  It is simple....  However, please note, XenoGC 2 will have compatibility with newer consoles DOL-101... DUOQ will not work with DOL-101 and full-size media (word is the smaller media is ok, since it the time it takes to accelerate this media is smaller, and within the small timeout window given on the I/O control logic on DOL-101).  You will have much better luck with older consoles, e.g. DOL-001.  

Please, I encourage you to research this before buying a chip, and find the one that is correct for your console."
,rmd,2006-12-22T19:53Z,"thats the worst shit i have ever heard. regardless of media, regardless of size.. they all work.

the only real difference with duo q is that you need wires to connect to the points. xeno gc (both versions) is simply placed on top and soldered down.

although all the chips work fine, the viperchip is the best without a doubt."
,elyk1212,2007-01-01T00:30Z,"md, not true, friend.  DuoQ won't work on several DOL-101 consoles.

BTW, I am a computer engineer, so I have a little experience in these things ;).   I program and desgin embedded systems (hardware and software).  While these are not ASICs for use in game consoles, similar design fundamentals exist. 

 Regardless however, trust me, it will not work with serveral of my DOL-101 consoles.  The timeout routine for disc checking (or perhaps something else I haven't considered) on the DOL-101 boards cause a system fault.  It may very well be something else I haven't considered, but I do not have the hardware design details, or I could likely tell you.

I was lead to believe the timeout window was the cause, and it does make sense (larger mass to spin with same force applied = longer time to achieve equivalent angular of velocity smaller disc)

Please let me know what models you have used with the standard DouQ.   This would likely help others, also."
,elyk1212,2007-01-01T00:36Z,"Typo: 
(larger mass to spin with same force applied = longer time to achieve equivalent angular velocity of a smaller disc)
-----------------------------------------------
BTW, actually, DUOQ copied some of XenoGCs application code, however there are small details omitted.  Also, XENO has a new chip that uses a modified set of software separate from both previous chips (XenoGC 2).
Anyhow, please let me know."
,gardengc,2007-09-04T03:55Z,Hi does anyone know an emulator to go with this / is it possible to play on my win vista 32 computer.

Yes, GCube is a free open source gamecube emulator.  But it is not super functional.  "
,Dudeitskevin22,2008-11-14T16:43Z,"tried the dolphin emulator. doesn't work, looks like people will need a better emulator or you'll either have to buy it or mod your game cube. Oh well I really wanted to play this without buying a gamecube haha. I finally got a computer powerfull enough to emulate these games and alot of todays games."
,tommymcgee,2009-02-12T20:13Z,dolphin emulator works wonderfully on this. getting a pretty steady 30fps with it. only problem im having is getting the sound to work.
,RevenantUK,2009-04-23T05:31Z,"As I have Gamecube and Pikmin game mentioned I feel I can post freely.
(original stuff in purple )

Is Dolphin the best emulator for Vista 64  or  shall I just buy games that are now over priced due to WII.  (Just pre orderded Ghostbusters game for PC @ 19.99 UK - Amazon BTW)


"
,RevenantUK,2009-04-23T05:41Z,Try setting admin in Vista 64. don't trust newer versions as better. some break on x64 yet older versions are ok.  (Dolphin Related)
,elyk1212,2009-05-24T09:54Z,"RE Dolphin: 

Haven't tried it... and I haven't used GCube heavily either.  

But really, with how cheap a used cube is... why not pick one up for $20USD, and a chip for about $10-15? ... your set.... and you're playing at 100% accuracy (since running on hardware compiled to run on).

As it always is, emulation will get better for this console as time progresses."
,Lucky13s,2009-09-14T01:28Z,I'm gonna patiently wait for further updates on the Dolphin emulator before giving this a try. They are getting very close to it working.
,jnorte94,2010-01-29T04:44Z,Works in dolphin not 100% but playable Thanx :)
,Lucky13s,2010-07-01T22:57Z,"Hmm, It sounds like Pikmin 1 (PAL) is working now for dolphin, but every now and then it gets random slowdowns."
,niibeck,2010-12-10T20:50Z,this game dont works in the day 2 in the forest of hope  the emu stop working somebody nows why ?? i have dolphin emu
[T],youssef0eddoumali,2011-02-05T16:32Z,coooooooool
,luisaglvs,2011-05-31T21:33Z,Ive downloaded this two times and its still not working. When I open the iso file with Daemon Tools It shows up as an inaccesible DVD and cant decompress it with winrar.
,luisaglvs,2011-05-31T21:34Z,Oh and if I open it directly from the emulator the screen goes black and thats it
,luisaglvs,2011-05-31T21:53Z,"wait no, forget it its working xD"
