This is the original Pikmin game for Nintendo GameCube.  There is a version out there that is password protected :(  This one is password free, and is ready to place on a DVD-R.  

	This image has been tested on Ritek G05 fullsize media with Duo Q on a NTSC DOL-001 and works great (This is a USA NTSC console)!  

Please help me seed!  THANKS !!
