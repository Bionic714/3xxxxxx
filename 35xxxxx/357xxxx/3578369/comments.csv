Audio: Russian, Dolby 5.1, DTS.
Sub: Nordic; se, fi, dk, no.
or maby you cant reed"
,Kaspar4283,2006-12-17T13:47Z,"Yes, I can read and I can also spell(!).

If you look at the top, you will see that its says:
""Spoken language(s):
Swedish
Texted language(s):
Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish""

Hence, the torrent information and the .nfo is conflicting."

,Kaspar4283,2006-12-17T21:42Z,"Ok, thx!"
,LuNk4n,2006-12-27T00:01Z,"If you are from Sweden and dont understand Russian - DO NOT DOWNLOAD!! The Swedish subtitles are a joke. You really cant understand a fucking thing. The person that have translated this movie probably cant a word Swedish.

I guess all Nordic subtitles are screwed up on this release. 

Sound and picture is great, but that does'nt help if you dont understand what they are saying. So look for another copy to download, or learn to understand russian.

I give this one a big fat zero out of five stars!

Sub: Nordic; se, fi, dk, no -- Yeah, in your dreams!"
,DrRat,2007-01-06T02:06Z,"Thers nothing wrong with the subs!!!
Just maout it or burn it Propaly! The subs are official dvd relise subs.

If you still got o problem? Learn Russian, its rily cool ;)

,Ziniac,2008-08-08T23:24Z,"ok ... so the info is conflicting.. ill give you that..
but how obvious is it anyway...

How many movies about a russian military unit stationed in Afghanistan do you think has been made in swedish... Ill tell you.. its probably less than one...

It doesnt take a genious to put two and two together.... the spoken language will probably be Russian... Ding Dong....

he he... but anyway.. its a cool movie.. I can definately recoment it.. if you can look past the russian language.. great war movie !!!"
,sardor81,2008-12-29T11:53Z,"SEED PLEASE, SEED!!!"
,urf-urf,2009-10-09T17:17Z,"You might want to search for ""the 9th company"" instead, it's the same movie but you get more results ...

for example wikipedia has this article on the movie:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_9th_Company

but does not have an article titled ""the ninth legion"""
,spogu,2011-06-04T16:56Z,"seeds... jakakaa... I have 87,9% I need ""loput"" 12,1%.. please help!! seeds..."
