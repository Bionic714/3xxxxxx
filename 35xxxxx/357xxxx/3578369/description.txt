The Ninth Legion is an intense and heroic drama about people who won the Afghan war within themselves. Two young soldiers have voluntarily requested to be taken into the Afghan operation. Having met at a conscription department they are sent straight to the notorious ninth division´s training camp on the border of Afghanistan. The ninth legion - gathered of the most aggressive and undisciplined men - has got one simple rule: the most heroic is always the one that appears first in the front line. Irrelevant to politics, The Ninth Legion is a movie about people and fate. Young soldiers´ lives were filled with loss and defeat. They were fighting for the Soviet empire - for nothing: upon their return home the Soviet Union had already collapsed.
