director's edition or what?:)"
,slindfors3,2006-12-06T07:32Z,"My Gothic 3 from Razor is the same size as this one, so I'll say the other versions were either rips or fakes ;)"
,linkinkampf19,2006-12-06T22:11Z,"Guys, the files include what looks to be two copies of the French version of the game. Looks to be either a rip or something as well, considering both the iso and rar files that look to be the games, are way too small to be the full release. The OP seems like he didn't know what he/she was doing."

Might be a good idea to know for sure before saying anything. Most uploads are around 3.18gb give or take but that isn't to say that the 6.0gb is a bad thing. Would be nice it people would include a file list with their uploads so we could read it before we download."
