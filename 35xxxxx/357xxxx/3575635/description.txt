Super Structures of the World: Eurotunnel makes a stop in London to ride the 35-mile length connecting France and England. The longest undersea tunnel is set 131 feet beneath the water. It took six years to build and can transport up to 31 million passengers a year. Indeed a marvel of modern construction, the chunnel offered a great potential to link England with the rest of Europe. This documentary looks at the building and usage of the hidden wonder.
