,Mikie,2007-01-11T22:41Z,nice cd mix! :D Heard about Dispatch reunion?? Thought u might if u listen to state radio
,kennx2000,2007-01-11T23:25Z,"This is a very nice mix...if you are a chicken fuckin' redneck with a truck stuck in your ass. 

It's REALLY boring except a few highlights - like Jurassic 5, The Raconteurs and Budos Band. 

Please let this be your last compilation.

And by the way - the trackinfo is poor."

,sethdallob,2007-04-22T06:42Z,When does side 3 come out?
,Skerv,2009-07-09T21:49Z,"All the Realish mixes (save 2008) are very indie folk heavy, so don't expect anything to rock too much.  A lot of soft, acoustic, unheard-of bands dominate."
