,syko990,2007-04-24T05:41Z,"Thanks for the upload, but I think this movie needs to be re-encoded.Quality is not good and vlc 8.6b reports  it to be a broken avi file needing repair to enable seek operation while playing.

GSpot v2.70a Analysis:

Note: 74 bytes unneeded bytes at end of file

AUDIO
0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3
48000Hz  64 kb/s , Monophonic

VIDEO
Codec DIV3 Name DivX 3 Low-Motion
Len 2:09:58 Frms 186,943 kbps 608 Qf 0.250
Pics/s 23.976  Frames/s 23.976
Pic (w x d) 352 x 288

The actual ratio is not clearly known as the video opens in a visible widescreen mode within a 1:1 ratio video on vlc with black borders on top and bottom , but it is more like 352 x 200 pixels.

Since it is the only ripped copy ,there is no choice.But I am certainly extremely disappointed"
