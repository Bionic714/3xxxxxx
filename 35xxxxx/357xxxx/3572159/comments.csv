,fefeto,2006-12-07T09:31Z,"Please, keep you lies to your self.......The last testament, to funny for words!, how could he write a book with no knowledge from the old or new testament, there is so many things written in the quran that is totally wrong...the funniest example is the he wrote that jesus mother mary is brother wit Aaron brother of Moses........but that is what i can expect from uneducated pegans...."
,Lobac,2006-12-07T15:31Z,"Fefeto, because the christian fairy tale is more correct than the islamic one? 
Stupid fuck!. People are dying over religious reasons, it?s like fighting over who was right, H. C. Andersen or the Grimm Brothers"
,Freeten,2006-12-07T16:01Z,"Despite what all the retards here are saying Islam is the third of the planet's population and the fastest growing religion on earth. it's spreading much faster than the times of the conquests. just get consumed in ur own animosity u stupid retards. the dogs bark while the caravan is moving forward. I have a question... where does the word algorithm actually come from? who was Algorithmi ? who taught the europeans to use soap when they wouldn't even have a bath... who was fibonacci's teacher and where did he go to study ? go inform urself and know who was the real uneducated ... the stupid crusaders when they got in touch with the enlightment and knowledge of the muslims in europe (spain etc...) were themselves amazed and struggled to steel every peace of it, till they had their churches decorated with portraits of the virgin mary wearing a scarf that they found to be a real exquisite peace of art , imagine what was written on the scraf ... ""there is no god but god and muhammad is the messenger of god""  in arabic calligraphic design the morons didn't even understand it :) ... well I think that's enough for u but wash your mouth with soap before talking about this great religion.

Peace :)"

,BDLidd,2006-12-07T18:50Z,Thank you! I am a Christian interested in Islam; Do you have a link for the Quran in English?
,Freeten,2006-12-07T19:44Z,"Hi BDLidd,
This looks like a good collection, it has some translations and koran related english-Ebooks:

Peace"
,Freeten,2006-12-07T20:08Z,"Yeah, right lobar, people are great but if u compare those same people before and after Islam came to them, the difference will be clear... from ignorant pagan desert arabs to rulers of the world at their time."
,BigRadi0Head,2006-12-07T20:44Z,"God bless u bluewater;
and ignore this shit and continue to post 
after all there maybe one that understands among the idiots"
,screenslave,2006-12-08T12:22Z,"Not all muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are muslim. Coincidence? Think not. Listen to the hypocritic reading of a hypocritic book, talking about love when all Islam stands for is terror, death, non-democracy and sick obidience. Don't let yourself get fooled by these people, there is nothing about love in their minds. Only control, terror and death to those who don't agree with them. Wake up and stay sharp, defend the Western culture and freedom."
,fefeto,2006-12-08T18:33Z,"Hey mr lobac, if you think religon kills peaople you must be really stupid.......its people that kills people because thats in some peoples nature...so stick to reality fool......"
,fefeto,2006-12-08T18:40Z,"And by the way, talking about the crusade time...please...the muslims seams to be stuck in that time and havnt gone forward with time as they still have that barbarian mentality.....you can belive anything u want muslims even pray to a black stone is ok if u belive that is good sons of a pegan.....read the bible and you will understand that the quran is not historical correct....learn your history "
,gomzi,2006-12-08T18:41Z,"religion kills people, same way as one community kills another, or community members kills other within thesame community, its the human way to kill each other on the basis of difference of beliefs or lust of power and greed.
Buts Islam is most evil thing for humans, where muslims do each and every thing for the lust of 72 virgins in heaven. Its not their fault, the root of islam was made on 72 virgins. Look what muslims are doing now puting liquid explosives in the milk bottles of their infants to blow non-muslims. "
,fefeto,2006-12-08T18:57Z,"is say people kills people and not the religon, that means if a person has some kind of humanity, common sense and love for humans being he would understand that killing a person or 100 for cause some book says it adn cause people dont think or belive like them....so in the end its the human stupidity that makes them kill.....even thou islam teaches them to kill followers of the holy book(bible), it say even not to friend with christians, jews...well its a sad storie this about the muslims and it will be war for sure one day again...sadly............"
,Lobac,2006-12-08T18:57Z,"Well fefeto, only a person like you would think that, I was saying that religion itself was killing people...religious disagreements is one of the reasons behind many cruel things done by people. And a person talking shit about the Quran and thinking the Bible is more correct when its comes to the story of Mary, really shouldn?t talk about reality."
,fefeto,2006-12-08T19:20Z,"well thats true that religous disagreements is a reason....and we can clearly see now who is trying to kill who in this time.........in the name of a religon

so you have a good piont there"
,Freeten,2006-12-08T19:39Z,"I see well who called the iraq war a crusade ?(iow...oppression war)  and a war for faith (iow... for Oil), who did the holocaust ? read ""mein kampf"" to see that the sick hitler killed innocent jews ""out of being a good christian"" , who killed all the civilians (including muslims jews etc...) in the capture of jerusalem by the crusaders. did saladin kill any civilians in the recapture of the same city? who exterminated the native american peoples and their centuries old  civilizations ?mayas aztecs incas etc... A genocide in the name of religion. well just open ur eyes u retard and have a look at history. face the reality ! "
,Freeten,2006-12-08T19:48Z,"Fefeto , seriously, go educate yourself and stop speaking out of ignorance ! if the koran ordered the killing of non muslims , the muslims would have exterminated the christians in europe when they ruled over them. instead they left them alone and even protected them , which I don't think u can say the same of the christians when lets say they invaded the american continent (discovered with the technical help of arab sailors)"
,Freeten,2006-12-08T20:08Z,"If muslims weren't there nobody would have saved europe from the dark ages. just for ur information : the first european medical school in salerno (italy) was staffed by muslim scholars. the europeans were still believing that disease was a result of possession by demons. while the muslims made the first statement in history that it was caused by tiny particles. u can't ignore the impact that islamic civilization had on humanity. there are 10000 words of arabic origin in english (Algebra, zero, cotton, alcohol, zenith, Admiral, etc...) and 6000 in spanish. just to have an idea on the impact. "
,Freeten,2006-12-08T20:11Z,"so stop your stupidity and show some gratitude. just like many christian scholars did, not ignorant morons like u."
,fefeto,2006-12-08T20:30Z,"here is a link that might intrest u then, talking about hitler............

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m2OzEvyrsw

meeting with Mufti Haj Amin Al Husseini wich was ofcourse happy to meet hitler and try to get help and kill the rest of the Jews and to be his partner in war.....just read the facts and the quran proparly and you will see the clear links between hitler and islam as well...thay are both based on one idea and accepts no other...all other religons are accepting eachother

and heres a link about mr. al husseini if u didny know about him

http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_mandate_grand_mufti.php"
,fefeto,2006-12-08T20:32Z,"and by the way, the western world knew and know how to use this knowledge the arab world and other pasrt of the world taught us.........you still stuck 600 years back"
,heavyweight,2006-12-09T01:27Z,Can someone please seed
,Freeten,2006-12-09T10:01Z,"u r so simplistic fefeto, linking politics with religion. al husseini was an ottoman puppet he was a guy from the aristocracy who were trying to protect their interests. he switched sides many times like many others did. there were even jews who conspired to sell other jews. let me remind u that the ottomans were brought down by the arabs. "
,Freeten,2006-12-09T10:15Z,"another fact is that hitler, and nazism in general hated all other races that are not arian like them. pretty much like the KKK or zionism or others there was no alliance here. well maybe the next tailored documentary u see hitler meeting with with churchill u wud think that they were conspiring to commit a genocide. or maybe hitler was a muslim  lol that won't surprise me of someone like u. go get some serious documentation instead of falling victim to the tailored documentary education. I agree it's easier to understand for low IQs but it's not accurate at all."
,Freeten,2006-12-09T10:26Z,"about the koran did u ever study it ? or maybe u have seen it in some documentary that I don't know who made... there is a whole science of koran and tafssir as well as circumstances of revelation , people spent their lives to study it and understand it. and now there are people with absolutely no background and no knowledge except some documentaries and online propaganda, and then they pretend to know everything about the koran. they even don't know arabic. "
,Freeten,2006-12-09T10:41Z,"Just for ur information, the europeans got their first knowlege directly from the muslims, they were closed on themselves and even forgot who was plato. they didn't open themselves to thoers civilizations like the muslims did. well at least since u recognized part of that u wud accept that Islam was a cornerstone of human civilization. and there are muslim scholars engineers operating in the west even in our times, the statistics say that the finest physician in the US are of pakistani origin and are muslims. so stop playing down this great religion and all the fruits it gave to humanity."
,Freeten,2006-12-09T10:46Z,"well Fefeto , I don't see any future for the west if people from the extreme right like u keep increasing. at least the muslims obey their god they don't obey some bishop who will later confess that he was a gay or  don't know what."
,fefeto,2006-12-09T13:00Z,"Please mr camelfucker, incest marry your cousins sick people.....the problem is that your book dont respect other ways of life or other religions, thats why we have this problem today and has had for many hundred of years 1400 years or so.....and true ortodox living follows the bible as it should so dont talk things u dont know about...i bet you even didnt read the bible nor the quran......"
,Freeten,2006-12-09T14:10Z,wow wow easy simple minded Fefeto ! u see who is the barbarian who started swearing. I just said that many bishops are gays and that the rate of sex offense within the church authority is getting alarming. that's a fact. U just can't deny it. 
,Freeten,2006-12-09T14:15Z,"Second, Im American proud, proud of my country and proud of my religion, for ur information I left christianity 10 years ago. Im muslim now thank God. I was sick of the crowds of maniacs  like u populating churches. "
,Freeten,2006-12-09T14:30Z,"third u r again pretending to know about the koran while u have no clue about it. wait give me the link where u learned the koran ... what's the name of the documentary ? come on go study it seriously, read different translations or better learn arabic. It took me 2 years to learn arabic. I guess even if in ur case it takes 10 it would be worth it.  after that go on to read the different taffsseer (ibn katheer, jalalain, and so) and the circumstances of revelation etc... 
I've read the bible for a long time before converting. I've even read the jewish one, and I respect both, I believe in them except in the things that were changed by those sick bishops who said what they didn't do and used the church and religion to control people. why do u think the french revolution took place? people had enough of the manipulation and control the church used to do. they even had to buy tickets so that god forgives them. come on get back to reality and open your eyes !

seriously I feel sorry for u...

,Regulafidei1,2006-12-13T00:35Z,"I have observed that all converts are very keen on proving that they have done the right choice! I hope that those that have made you convert did it for free and are not waiting for a heavenly reward or used y as an object of repent or as a discount on their sins. ( If we ask the Lord for forgiveness, we will be forgiven)
Why do you converts leave the religion about our Lord Jesus and take for yourselves religions that acknowledge the same return of our Lord Jesus in the end of days.That is what your book says and you seem to forget that the Lord Jesus will judge you (according to the quran) in the end. I doubt that you have understood the message of our (all) Lord Jesus. Why do you muslims focus on a doubted mere messenger of God when you should focus on the superior, our Lord Jesus.( Don't we all know that the Lord Jesus is eternal). Why do you smear everyone that believe in the fundament of the Allmighty? What did the Lord wrong? Is it hard to understand the concept of the ultimate sacrifice? Why do people attack and judge people and call them names if you don't know them. Are y the right ones to judge? When did religious books become a tool for the siners (we are all) to refer to and call other less competent. Isn't the salvation personal? Isn't religion for the personal contact with god? Isn't religion for the common salvation?  Plz all,  just on the basis of your personal level read about the work of our Lord Jesus and if you have an atom of good humanity you'll understand the message. Deeds weigh more than words! Believers, Muslims and converts, remember and reflect on the Lord and his born not made son ( everybodies Messaiah)

Friendly thoughts and a call on everyone to follow the Lord Jesus just for their own sake. 
I wish you Good Luck! 
Merry Christmas, Meelad Mubarak!(The real Eid by which we all know that God still believe in us and sent His only Son to save us, this is the real second chance) 

Burn your money and time on good stuff! LCD TV maybe xbox nintendo :) Have fun "
,Freeten,2006-12-14T08:47Z,"Hi, Im one of the converts, and let me tell u that I came to this great religion (Islam) with no compulsion and no pressure, there was nobody who converted me, I converted to Islam out of real conviction and rational thinking while I spent all my life in christianity and knew much about it.  I was a devote christian and Im now a devote muslim ,thanks god, after finding out about the truth that was concealed to me for such a long time. 
but in return I saw no reason in your rethoric (don't we all know that....) a rhetoric based on blind belief, the ""everybody knows"" kind of argument. I thus invite u urself to seriously learn about Islam and to leave out the church's emotional brainwash and charity extraction gatherings. because I already know about christianity probably much more that u. 
And about jesus christ (peace be upon him) know that he is equally respected in Islam and that I never rejected him. I still believe in jesus's message (pure monotheism) not in the message of people who came after him and altered it resulting in lots of different messages and bibles. jesus must be really sad that the monotheism he preached got transformed into a polytheism where he is considered as a god. and where people are not to be accountable for their evil actions just because they believe in the lie that jesus himself is innocent of. 
Please take my heartfelt advice and try to learn about Islam from an objective point of view Im sure u will finish by accepting it if u have a bit of humanity in ur heart and a grain of reason in your mind. the result is the jesus (pbuh) our beloved will be proud of us all for the fact that we returned to his originial message."
,Regulafidei1,2006-12-14T20:39Z,"I'm very glad to hear that you embrace our Lord Jesus christs message, and still you question the eternal essence of our Lord Jesus by questioning the most essential a beliver must rely on. And that is that we belivers all know that jesus is eternal. This is the eternal argument! How can a beliver question that argument. Don't you belive in the Allmighty and everything that comes from him as eternal? On the other hand you seem to question blind belief. It is only prophets that have revelations my friends, is it possible that you compare yourself with the prophets? And again you attack the churches and seem to know more, are you sure that y met the real church the one established by the Lord Jesus. The Chaitan is everywhere he attacks the believers in their weakest moment. Jesus is the safest road to God, don't question him because you will question the plan of God. You talk about rethoric, but seem to forget that you still use the I know best argument yourself. You have spent all your life in christianity, did you die and revive again. Who have told you that you have known everything about christianity, I would like to meet a person so complete in the religion. You probably know more than me, y right! you don't even know a person and consider yourself better, y maybe you'll have a better spot in paradise, as if paradise is a mainstreet where we struggle to get the best spot to sell our useless merchandize : ) It strikes me that the only way y refer to the church is as an institution of brainwash and charity extraction, is that all you felt in church why didn't you make a change for the better, why didn't you spread the good message? There must have been something good you must have learned from your bible studies, stand for it, maybe you had found sometning? 
Or did y sleep out your hangover on sunday morning, and by waking up in the afternoon believing that church people know nothing? Just kidding! :)
 Why do you change religion on that argumental basis, where is the truth you never found, did you search enough, where y realy a christian in your heart, maybe you never left christianity, or maybe you just embraced a new institution of brainwash and charity extraction ( don't forget your zakat) 
People struggle to become christians and it is not easy, but it doesen't matter who is best, competition is for the olympics and earthly practice, the competition for the heavenly is not relevant for the individual. Mudaraba is filthy. 
Plz why do you listen to others, even on the cross the Lord Jesus asked the father for forgiveness, eventhough he died for our sins, and still you don't understand the essence of the trinity, who are these demagogs of the chaitan you listen to. 
Thanks for refering to our Lord Jesus as our beloved, he truely is! 
Do you need me in Islam my friend, you need companion in the empty univers? let us not pretend to worship together, let us play a game instead!
