The Kumbakonam fire tragedy where many students were killed becomes the focal point from where the story of 'Vathiyar' takes off. And it's to the credit of the director that instead of using the tragedy as a mere reason for hero Durai's change of heart from a pacifist school teacher to an aggressive one, Venkatesh probes a little deeper. And tries to throw light on the callousness of the establishment and the rampant corruption in high places which result in such unfortunate incidents. The lines (Gopinath) are penned with care, they are witty or meaningful as the situation demands.
