In Paris 1877, rats save a baby from death and raise him in the underground of the Opera de Paris. This child becomes The Phantom of the Opera (Julian Sands), a half-human half-animal breed, who falls in love with Christine Daaé (Asia Argento), an opera singer just beginning her career. He fights for her love against the aristocratic Baron Raoul De Chagny (Andrea Di Stefano), though Christine loves them both equally.
