,jengiscan,2008-07-10T15:47Z,"Bizzare behaviour from some of the comments...
They must have typed in bestiality and then they write about how sick it all is!
Im not gay, I dont visit gay sites therefore I do not complain on gay sites about homosexuality.
I am reminded of a friend of a friend who 'accidentally' typed in his credit card details to a porn site!
By the way if you are into this sort of stuff these pictures are pretty crap and not really worth the effort.
Woof woof!!!"
