-kinda newb. "
,Zexel,2006-12-19T06:53Z,"if you have the same nero burning rom as i have, nero6 or higher, in extras you can choose (mount a disc image) use that to burn the iso file.

ore you can mount the files direct with /tex/Deamon tools http://www.brafiler.se/download.php?fileid=741

when you have installed deamon you click the icon in the startbar and where it says no media clic and choose the iso file. so now it should be ok=D.,.,.,"

,rock500,2009-05-28T20:46Z,"it took me a few days to download this, it went fine, but it turns out its not a RAR archive! it was just a regular folder, when i went inside the folder, there was no ISO file or nothing, just a SFV file and alot of files with the name 001. going to 085., what kind of files are these??? help"
,h1vem1nd,2009-08-13T19:31Z,"To everyone asking about the .001-.085 files:

Those files are a multi-part archive. Just unzip the .001 file with WinRAR, and it will automatically unpack the fragments from the other files into the complete ISO.

As for the ""trojan warning,"" pretty much every crack you'll find for any program flags as a trojan with certain antivirus software (most notably McAfee and Norton, both of which are substandard anyway). Same thing happens with keygens. Calm down and scan the file with AVG or Avast before screaming about viruses in the torrent."
