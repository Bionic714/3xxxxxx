,Ebeeto,2006-12-19T13:07Z,"Ever so thankful, dude! I missed out on this show when it was new and cool, so I'm doing this intense.

A little bird whispered in my ear though, that the 1GB version of season 4 is with 25-minute episodes, and not the original 30-minute ones. They cut them down for japanese release or something... Is that correct?"
,Redman07,2007-04-03T13:16Z,please seed!
,LooseChanj,2008-07-28T13:17Z,"This does NOT appear to be the Japanese version, but I've only watched the intro to one episode.  "
,Vexxarr,2009-04-25T17:14Z,These do not appear to be cut. They all run well over 25 minutes. From 26:25 to 28:42.
