You\'re a hero with your hands full!

Deep in the Peruvian Jungle, assume the role of Pitfall Harry, a fearless, rough-and-ready treasure seeker who battles evil using his athletic ability and a knapsack filled with adventure gear. Your mission: race against a rival explorer to find hidden treasures, which in the wrong hands could spell doom for you and your friends.

Featuring over 40 perilous levels, including lush rain forests, creature-ridden caves and vast glacial mountains, you are challenged to explore a dynamic obstacle-filled world. Adventure your way through a vast landscape, from forests to ancient ruins to subterranean mines. With fast-paced action pathways and a host of obstacles and challenges, you must face the consequences of your every decision. 
Crossing treacherous jungle terrain and dark areas filled with puzzles, tricks and traps, you\'ll be swinging on vines, avoiding crocodiles and dodging rolling logs as you unearth artifacts and use your cunning to defeat dangerous foes.
