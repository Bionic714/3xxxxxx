This CD delivers 63 minutes of Snelder's energetic E-Newage music.

Delicate keyboards are almost swamped by the might of demonstrative electronic rhythms and rushes. The synthetics are versatile and creative, drawing upon traditional synthesized sounds and exploring new noises with equal dedication.

Strongly melodic in a dramatic way, the music fills the listener with expectant bliss, the promise of vaster horizons and unlimited possibilities. The tunes possess a charisma that is rooted in their playful harmonies. There is a profusion of epic crescendos lurking among these dynamic songs.

A few tracks feature operatic female vocals (of a non-lyrical nature) which generate a classical flair for these indefatigable pieces.

Snelders' music harks back to the early 80s, drawing some comparisons to Tangerine Dream's style (circa "Tangram"), but he has infused an inordinate amount of grandeur to this sound, propelling the music far beyond the earthly stratosphere.
