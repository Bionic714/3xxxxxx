"We?re happy to announce the release of ?Bobby McFerrin: Live in Montreal?. This live concert DVD was recorded at the Montreal Jazz Festival, and brilliantly captures the astonish and thrilling live wire act that is Bobby?s solo show.

This time around, Bobby is joined by four surprise guests - such surprises in fact, that Bobby did not know their identities until the moment they appeared on stage to perform! Joining Bobby are trapeze artist Evelyne Lamontagne, French-Canadian singer/cellist Jorane, Cameroon bassist and singer Richard Bona (who performed with Bobby on ?Beyond Words?), and Urban Tap?s tap sensation, Tomago. As Bobby did not know who the guests were going to be, there were no rehearsals and no song selection and no preparation ? just music made entirely in the moment!"
