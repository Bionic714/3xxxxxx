,mad_flyer,2006-12-04T23:39Z,Does this actually work? Who wants to give it a go?
,Rexxxifon,2006-12-04T23:58Z,download the komplett package and give it a go.
,zkalos,2006-12-05T18:33Z,"If the serial in this package not working to You, 
please download the FS2004-MajesticDash8-300 Cracker.zip! The serial maybe Windows or System specific! Follow the step by step instructions! I hope it will be working to You."
,mad_flyer,2006-12-05T19:54Z,I am willing to give it a go as long as it's virus free.
,mad_flyer,2006-12-05T19:56Z,"Forgot: Yes, the serial in this damn add-on is hardware specific. A version was uploaded sometime ago with OllyDBG program. It worked half and half. I was one of the un-lucky fellows who did not get it to work. I doubt this'll work. Also, where can I find this Cracker.zip?"
,zkalos,2006-12-05T22:25Z,FS2004-MajesticDash8-300 Cracker.zip
,ka205,2006-12-06T01:32Z,Anyone able to give the link of the crack or at least tell me which site to find it?  Thanks

,zkalos,2006-12-06T19:45Z,"The crack not working for Me in XP SP1, but I install few days ago XP SP2, and now working."
,caruso2006,2006-12-08T09:05Z,"RThanks a lot...much fun to fly but:

I have no difference between inside and outside sounds(with 43mo of sounds there's surely something wrong).

Anyone got problems with sound too?
"
,zkalos,2006-12-08T15:03Z,"Its correct, because the sounds are generated through a DirectX modeling system that bypasses the way MSFS generates sounds. What do you miss? The changes in the sound going from inside the aircraft to outside and for that matte,r even the changes that will occur when turning your head in the VC. Read the rewiew in avsim.com"
,mad_flyer,2006-12-11T17:05Z,WWOOOWW!!! THANKS ZKALOS!! It finally worked! I owe you one!!!
