Professor Friedman came to Iceland in 1984 to give a lecture at The University of Iceland.

This is an interview with him on Icelandic State Television. The setup is interesting, with Friedman are three radically left-wing scholars who criticize him each at a time for everything from monetary policy to drug policy. One of them, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, is the current president of Iceland.
