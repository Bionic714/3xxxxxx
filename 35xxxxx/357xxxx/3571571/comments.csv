,scorch56,2008-07-18T12:43Z,"Just wanted to let everybody know.. for the BUNCH of people who are downloading this at any given time.. 2 years later. I just wasted 3 days.. this ISO doesn't work.. I've tried EVERYTHING.

Doesn't work on my 98SE box.. nor my XP one. Have tried EVERY crack available from GCW. Have tried a CLEAN untouched install. Have tried a SecuROM loader.. nothing. It always asks for the CD. OP doesn't state whether this is the UK or US release.. so tried all patches to v1.15 as well and then tried to crack. Even tried to fake it with German files (since some CD check removers are for German ver).. nothing.

It just plain doesn't work folks.. at all. OP may have done a 1:1 copy or prepatched.. impossible to tell.. but I've tried everything.

A real shame.. since it's supposedly a real good and rare game. Oh well.. looks like it's back to my ""rip""."
,scorch56,2008-07-18T13:29Z,"..And as if that wasn't enough.. I finally got the game to run by overwriting the main EXE with the one from paradigm's old ""rip"" of the game from '99.

At GCW it says to extract and copy (as in burn) the original disc #2 as a mixed mode CD which means there's obviously redbook audio (as in the music) on CD #2. This ""amateur"" didn't even image disc 2 right! You can tell by the size of ISO 2. So there's no music in the game because he didn't put it in the image. "
,Nered,2009-05-22T14:13Z,"The game works, just mount it, install it, patch it, and run machines.exe 

Idiots cant get it running, right scorch56 ?
NO CRACKING NECESSARY "
,Levethian,2009-06-26T14:45Z,"The comments were worrying me...

As it turned out, its really easy to get working.

Thanks for the upload! Wish there was a way to change hotkeys, but meh."
,cardenasrr53,2010-02-03T04:01Z,"Hooolaaa...

,DVDude,2010-07-29T20:34Z,works fine on win7pro 64... just remember to copy the d3drm.dll file to system32... google it to get it.
