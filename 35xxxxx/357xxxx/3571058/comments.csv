,Commiesan,2008-01-17T18:16Z,"Hi!

I'll post this on all three toorents, so hopefully someone will notice it! ;)

I Cannot get the game to work either. I Downloaded ""1/2"" & ""2/2"" and installed the game. I tried to start a new game. The game opend and i Could create a player, but then it told me to insert cd1. I tried with the ""1/2"" .dmg, but that did not help. Then i Downloaded the ""(MAC) Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy updates, extra maps, no-cd key,"", Patched the game, and extracted the Nocd.toast.sitx and clicked on the Nocd.toast. The cd-image appeared in Devices, but now i could not even open the game, it asks for cd1 immideatly. When people say i shall burn it to a cd, do they mean i shall burn the ""1/2.dmg"" or the ""Nocd.toast""?

Plz help! //Commiesan"

This has the NO_CD and updates. Install the updates-1.0.1b and 1.0.1c, then make a copy TO A REAL CD the NO_CD (I used toast, but you can use disk utility)

Verify then mount...

Enjoy...

It worked online!!! "

,Superman10101,2010-06-08T20:51Z,"Hey i figured it out guys!!!

Step one: download updates 1.01b and 1.01c from: http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3571053 (or u can search google for update downloads)
(DO NOT USE THE NO CD APP FROM THAT TORRENT)

Step two: Download update 1.01d from: http://www.maclife.com/forums/topic/62428

Step three: Download update 1.01e from:
http://www.macgamefiles.com/download.php?item=17967&title=Jedi+Knight%3A+Jedi+Academy+Rev+E

Step four: Download crack (only works if game is updated to 1.01E) from:
http://www.macclubindonesia.com/forums/showthread.php?t=15842

App will open and its easy to patch. I guarantee this will work! Let me know if I helped"

,fabiokey,2010-06-22T06:22Z,can someone please seed? :) tks!
,ssbdk,2010-09-01T21:10Z,"so basically - i did all the instructions as from the last comment. I am not a noob. i've done cracks etc 100 of times.. but this one won't work.. first of all:
the crack provided - doestn work.. say app had to quit unexpected. i fixed that by copying & replacing the iPatcher file in : ""Jedi Academy MP v9467 NoCD Patch"" (show package) /contents/MacOs/ 
with the iPatcher file from the iPatch program (show package) /Contents/Reseources/iPatcher (Show package again)/Contents/MacOs and voila..

now the crack.app works (same for MP)
now... i apply the crack on the patched (b through e) JA file. and the crack asks me this: ""iPatch need to change permissions for these files : MacOS
Jedi Academy""

I agree to change permissions and... i get this: ""Error /Applications/Jedi Academy/Jedi Academy.app/Contents/MacOS
/Applications/Jedi Academy/Jedi Academy.app/Contents/MacOS/Jedi Academy ""


HELP PLEASE!? :3"
,supabeasty,2010-09-21T21:42Z,"I followed all the steps, when I go to open the application in the ""JA Mac 1.0.1b Update"" Folder it says ""Jedi Academy cannot continue.  Couldn't load default.cfg""  

Can I get some help?"
,PPLOHMAMA,2012-02-02T14:26Z,"Even tho Disc 1, Disc 2 and No-CD is mounted,
It requires Disc 1 to play.

Can get to menus and create character, but past that cannot continue.

This torrent doesent have crack.
Other torrent with extras,updates,crack doesent work either.

Superman10101's one update link is broken so cant follow his steps also.
