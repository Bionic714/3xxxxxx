,knowyourpast,2011-09-13T09:25Z,Thanks very much for this. As I've written on the FYP album - Roxy Music's first four albums should be on the National Curriculum in Britain so that kids can learn how truly unique a sound Roxy introduced to the world. Outstanding in every way from the music to the album cover.
