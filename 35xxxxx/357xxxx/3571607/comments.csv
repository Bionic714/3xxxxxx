,lÃ¤ggdags,2006-12-06T12:55Z,"You left out their best album, their first one, plus a whole lot of other shit..."
,amir8500,2007-02-07T00:13Z,OMG WTF?!  SEED PLEASE!  As of 2-6-07 I am the only one seeding.  Say no to leeching.
,jayrock1977,2007-04-11T04:19Z,Why leave out their crowning musical achievement southernplayalisticcadillacmusik. I just can't wrap my mind around it. Please explain yourself.
,Occhino,2007-06-26T13:18Z,"Well, we all can agree that this torrent sucks... You've left out much of the best material they've publicated.

You've forgotten to throw in, as läggdags and jayrock1977 said, the first album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, their fifth album Big Boi & Dre Present, Outkast. And you've also forgotten Southemplay/Stankonia, their compilation from last year."
,DeShon,2007-09-11T01:00Z,What does almost everything mean? Good job sublimemm.
,flappyboris,2007-10-10T00:58Z,"Thanks sublimemm

Ya know, given the fact that sublimemm was kind enough to make a torrent of what he has, that he specifically stated the contents in the description, and even notated in the title that it was *almost*, I am surprised to see users feeling the need to crack on him for it and leaving negative remarks. Especially since your getting all this music for free anyhow!

Rather than being upset, I suggest appreciating his donation to the torrent community.
