,thesungod,2006-12-14T02:41Z,I've been looking for some good shit like this! Anyone know any other bands like this?
,Jolny,2006-12-26T01:05Z,"Hmm, depends. Other good progmetal bands are (favourites listed first):

Ayreon
Dream Theater
Zero Hour
Neal Morse
Beyond Twilight
Into Eternity
Vanden Plas

It's hard to find bands similiar to Pain of Salvation, though. You could always try this site:

,Nemu,2007-01-07T11:01Z,"I would really recomend the also swedish progressive metal group Opeth, usually alittle bit more heavy, otherwise alot like PoS with another *sound* cheers."
,shadzudh,2007-01-14T16:40Z,"I would also reccomend Symphony x, but if u are used to Dream Theater, Symph. X may appear a bit dull, but The Oddesy cd is awsome. But when it comes to PoS, they're just unique. Noone sounds like them, and they have the best vocal in the world, no doubt about that!!! tnx for this one, will seed surely, and if someone would like some info about progressive music, add me to msn  psick@hotmail.com...
keep spreading great music like this, just hope it's better than be, wish for something like Remedy Lane or perfect element... 
anyways, tnx again, i truly belive this is a great album..."
,GROD4N,2007-02-07T17:17Z,"IN FLAMES 

SOILWORK

HAMMER FALL

IS SOME OF THE GOOD SWEDISH METAL BAND"
,Airsofter84,2007-03-24T00:07Z,"You forgot Clawfinger ;)

,Thanatar,2007-07-12T14:06Z,"thx for the nice upp!

btw, if everybody's talking 'bout awesome prog-bands... try psychotic waltz. unfortunately only ""into the everflow"" and ""a social grace"" are really great (maybe the best albums i've ever heard!). i can also recommend the bands ""ephel duath"", ""porcupine tree"", ""riverside"" and most of the other bands named here...

btw, just to be mean: i already was on dream theater's world tour 2007, and they played the WHOLE images and words :-P"
,zezamu,2007-08-09T13:05Z,"Tool
A perfect circle
Isis
Miosis (A new cool band from Sweden)
Katatonia"
,kickaz1,2007-12-21T01:50Z,"Well. There is one band that all of you ""Dream Theater"" people should know about that is the dream of bands. Mainly their idols. The Canadian band: ""Rush"""
,asdasd123123,2008-04-08T21:57Z,"This is not pain of salvation?
This is some hip hop band with apparently the same name.."
