Why should anyone download such videos. Why are you butting in here. If you don't like to learn about the Bible, well don't. It's mean to sneak in here and try introduce controversial videos of Dr Naik (what a disgusting name). Have you yourself read the Bible, or do you suffice yourself, like most Muslims, to listen to what ignorant Muslims say about it? "
