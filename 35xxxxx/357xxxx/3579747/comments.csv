Check that for episodes, it doesn't say when they air new episode but you can count that yourself easily"

,Malz,2006-12-19T18:16Z,"Thank you for uploading the HR version. Hopefully this will be the standard in the near future.

I don't mind 1080i either but maybe it is too demanding version at the moment for the masses."
