,marcus_ivo,2007-02-09T03:28Z,"What is the best way to create a usable disc from this torrent?  
Is it supposed to be burnt to CD's or one DVD? Can you burn the images from a PC with something like Magic ISO?
 And if anyone has any tips or solutions for registration/activiation etc it'd be great if ytou could post them here.  Cheers."
,EL3RD,2007-02-09T19:20Z,"The serial number is included in the .rtf file which is a word file ..if you don't have word use note pad or word pad to open it. 

> rtf file is rich text file"
,EL3RD,2007-02-09T19:21Z,@ cdelaire : Thank you very much for this it is extremely appreciated by me! Keep up the good work! 
,EL3RD,2007-02-09T19:28Z,"These are .dmg files which are apple image files...similar to .iso but can only be opened using apple osx..You have to transfer them over to your mac machine in order to open and burn. 

I suggest you open the .rtf file and save the serial number before you move it over to the mac. "
