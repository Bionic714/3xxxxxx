,jetfang,2009-07-09T14:43Z,"Thanks for the upload, much appreciated.  And Strokeny, fortunately there are far more decent people in the world than sad, soulless characters like you.  It's quite sad that you can't see the decency, skill, artistry and humanity in someone like Micheal Jackson.  

The world was a better place for having him in it, and a sadder one now he's gone.  Rest in peace, Micheal."
