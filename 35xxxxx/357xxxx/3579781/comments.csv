,JohnyFiama,2006-12-20T04:17Z,"@Serialdad: Thanks for pointing it out. Sounds strange because I know for sure that the file is *not* in any way digitally corrupt/damaged at my end since I always test my files prior to sharing them.

So, I would assume that you either lack a proper codec, or your software settings are not properly configured. 

Based on my own experience, you are most likely not having the appropriate codecs installed on your system. I would assume that ""AC3 codec"" is missing. 

For your information, if you try running DivX movies on VLC (VideoLAN Client) [www.videolan.org/vlc/], the chance is VERY SLIM of you having such a problem. The good thing about VLC is that it has a wide-range support of codecs, which are, by the way, built right into the software, so you don't have to download any extra codecs (or codec packs, etc.) to get to see your movie. The same thing applies to sound codecs. Very powerful and efficient tool to play multimedia files with! 

Let me know if the problem persists. I'll be glad to help you out! :) Thanks for you feedback."
,JohnyFiama,2006-12-20T04:51Z,"NOTICE: For those of you out there who are encountering difficulties related to audio/video, you are most likely not having the proper codecs installed on your machine.

1) If the problem happens to be associated with video, you probably need to install the ""DivX Codec"". 2) If the problem is audio-related, you need to install ""AC3 Codec"" 3) For further info in regards to codec downloads (for Windows Media Player users), you may want to check out the following web site: http://www.wmplugins.com/

Even so, I *highly* recommend VLC (VideoLAN Client) [www.videolan.org/vlc/] when it comes to playing DivX movies or any file format for that matter because it has a wide-range of support for codecs, which are, by the way, built right into the software, so you don't have to download any extra codecs (or codec packs, etc.) to get to see your movie. The same thing applies to sound codecs. Very powerful and efficient tool to play multimedia files with! Hope, this will minimize further technical issues."
