This is the DivX format of the documentary "9/11 Mysteries - PART 1: DEMOLITIONS", which is the first one out of three in the "9/11 Matrix" series. So far, however, this part has only been released. Furthermore, I wanted to point out that this is
a rip from GoogleVideo (http://video.google.com/) but the overall quality is still very good unlike those flash movies you see on such sites. 

Creds to all seeders out there! :)

90 minutes of pure demolition evidence and analysis, laced with staggering witness testimonials. Moving from "the myth" through "the analysis" and into "the players," careful deconstruction of the official story set right alongside clean, clear science.  The 9/11 picture is not one of politics or nationalism or loyalty, but one of strict and simple physics.  How do you get a 10-second 110-story pancake collapse?

A movie that might actually reach our complacent mainstream. No agenda. No finger-pointing. Just the facts and the "mysteries." Look at that. Think about this. A story of people: Willie Rodriguez's strange recollection of noises on the 34th floor. Who was up there, bumping around? Scott Forbes' similar story, weeks before the towers fell. A story of blasting itself. Here's how shaped charges slice through steel beams to control the way they fall.

PART 1: DEMOLITIONS
Tall buildings shatter in 10 seconds, steel beams buckle as if crushed by Superman. A volcano of ash darkens the sky. Can jet fuel perform such a feat?

PART 2: HIJACKERS & PLANES (To come)
A 757 dives into the Pentagon, penetrating to its core. Invisible Arabs hijack airplanes, passengers make history and untraceable phone calls. ?Elementary, my dear Watson. Let?s roll.?

PART 3: WHO BENEFITS (To come)
Stock trades and civil rights go haywire. An empire is born as citizens enjoy the perfect Big Sleep. Bogart did say, ?All you owe the public is a good performance.? But who?s backstage?
