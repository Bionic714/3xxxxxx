His Name Is Alive (sometimes referred to simply as HNIA) is a band from Livonia, Michigan, essentially the personal project of musician Warren Defever.

Defever began recording as His Name Is Alive in 1986, inspired by experimental artists such as Eddie Cochran, King Tubby, Jimi Hendrix, Leadbelly, and 4AD Records's Cocteau Twins. In the early years of the band the vocalists were first Angie Carozzo and later Karin Oliver, a classmate of Defever in his freshman year at Eastern Michigan University before he dropped out to concentrate on music. Three cassettes were released, which attracted the attention of influential British record label 4AD Records. Livonia, His Name Is Alive's first album, was released in 1990.
