"This update of a standard reference in horse care reflects the results of the decade of research on horse nutrition that has taken place since the previous edition. The volume presents equations for calculating daily requirements for major dietary components, tables of daily nutrient requirements calculated from the equations, tables of nutrient concentrations required in total diets, composition of feeds commonly used for horses, extensive references, and more."


This torrent has just the book (pdf), I couldn't find the computer program, that is, I found it, but I couldn't make it work right... I don't know if there's something wrong about the program itself or maybe I just don't know how to work with it. (anyway, you can download it at http://newton.nap.edu/html/horsemodel/ ).


You can know more about the book in: http://newton.nap.edu/catalog/1213.html


If anyone by chance has the program (or if it worked with you), please share :)
