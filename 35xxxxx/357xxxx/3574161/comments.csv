[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-10T20:00Z,"this is really killing my connection. Have been seeding in apprx 500kB/s since i uploaded the torrent, and the pressure is still big. You guys who have about 60% or more right now, please help seed this when you're done. 

Then I thought I should upload some new tvtorrents like for example Dexter S01E11 :) and get back to this torrent again later if it still needs seeding."

[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-11T20:28Z,"something very cool by CBS is that you can watch all episodes online @ http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/
That's the TV spirit! 

Next step would be to make you legally download high quality videos for a monthly fee. (Like the zune pass but with TV instead of music). Then we don't PVR's and TiVo's at all :)"
[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-12T14:45Z,"Btw I looked into Dexter. SICK series.
I thought I could eat my dinner in front of S01E02, gosh I was almost going to vomit during the intro ;)"
