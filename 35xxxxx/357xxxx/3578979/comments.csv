,_pliex_,2006-12-18T10:45Z,"It depepnds on ""how"" you install it, you must've done something wrong. I haven't had any complaints from other people. Or maybe your computer couldn't handle it."
,lioncat,2006-12-18T15:39Z,who the hell will have XP (look) like Vista....if u want Vista u want the OS
,davenator,2006-12-18T16:49Z,Why waste your time. The only way to experience Vista is by getting it. Don`t screw up your PC by getting this crap.
,DarthBubba,2006-12-18T18:00Z,"Isn't this sorta like installing a rear deck wing and glass-pack mufflers on your Honda Civic, and pretending you have a Maserati?

Not that Vista is a Maserati..."

,Taokai,2008-06-05T04:24Z,"A lot of people want the look of Vista without actually having a buggy crappy OS... I for one would rather have rabid weasels nibble my testicles then use vista, of course it looks nice, but only fruits, idiots and mac users actually prefere the vista OS to xp. Thank you for the download _pliex_."
