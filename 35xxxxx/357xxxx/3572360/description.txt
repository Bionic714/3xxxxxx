Belly was a musical band formed in 1991 by former Throwing Muses members Tanya Donelly (also in The Breeders with Kim Deal) and Fred Abong. Based in Boston, Massachusetts, the band consisted of Tanya Donelly on lead vocals, Fred Abong bass, Tom Gorman guitar, and Chris Gorman drums. The band had an alternative rock sound that was uniquely mixed with both a twist of pop-reminiscent haunted melodies (much like those of Julee Cruise and the Cocteau Twins) and an occasional country music-like twang, which made it popular with college students searching for indie rock bands.
