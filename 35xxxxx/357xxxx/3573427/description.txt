Here is some brand new xero fo everyone. This time of a more serious flavour. 
But that doesn't mean it doesn't still kick ass.


This time we have some nice acoustic ballads
Sung to the tune of:


Slave - And I just cannot feel whole - So I smoke another bowl

(I Wanna Be) Crazy - surrender scream savor... you want this

Face The World - The moon without a care - Shown flowers in her hair

Your Name - If I wrote you a song would you come with me

Turnaround - I don't wanna feel anything at all
