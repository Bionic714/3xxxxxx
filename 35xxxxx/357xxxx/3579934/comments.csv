,bradfantin,2006-12-28T22:25Z,worked for me. download time 2 minutes about...
,dotcomrade,2008-01-30T10:37Z,"I've got a copy of this, ill seed :P"
,ShadowX96,2008-02-16T14:05Z,the severs are slow on downloading templates and loading leopard wont work
,Laen,2008-12-04T06:46Z,"For some reason fails to create a cd ""template"" using my Leopard installation CD. I tried downloading one from their list (all Tiger), burned the cd but it won't boot.
I have no idea what to do or what goes wrong."
,Xivilai,2009-04-14T11:01Z,"I was also having problems making a bootable dvd with leopard, but luckily i found a workaround on some guys blog:

1. Using Disk Utility in the Utilities folder create a new image of the Mac OS X Install DVD. Change the Image format option from ""compressed"" to ""read/write"". Create the disk image.
2. Mount the OS X install DVD disk image.
3. Trash the folder ""Optional Installs"" - whatever is in this folder prevents CDMaker from creating a boot disk template.
3. Open CDMaker and it will detect the mounted OS X install DVD disk image and create boot disk template from the startup data in the disk image.
4. Follow the instructions and burn your boot disk to DVD.
5. Boot computer from DVD to test. "

,joncppl,2009-08-29T03:38Z,"somebody please seed this, I really need it so I can install bootcamp!"
,joncppl,2009-08-29T04:22Z,"finally downloaded, thanks,
@avokiluk, make sure you remove the os x dvd, otherwise it will try and use that over the mounted image"
,joncppl,2009-08-29T04:23Z,"btw, does anyone know if this works with snow leopard?"
,ZeRaWaKH,2009-09-06T20:20Z,"Thanks a lot! BTW, I needed to change the tracker http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce to http://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce before I got this to work."
,Tigramber,2009-12-08T20:17Z,"Doesn't work for me either after deleting the ""Optional Installs"" folder. I get the same error. Boot disc is located on a USB drive, I've removed some of the language files as well. Why else might CDmaker not make the template?"
,nadrew,2011-03-19T17:15Z,This appears to be fake or at least not authentic. There is no CDMaker v2.0.0. A full download of the current release version is available at MacSerialJunkie [ http://www.macserialjunkie.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=9121 ].
