,Azrelle,2006-12-20T00:44Z,"will be seeding for at least a few days - good quality file for anyone still waiting on it to arrive. Got mine in about 4 hours total when there was only a few seeders.

Got fairly good connection here and should be on 24 hours for a while

Anyone with a link to a part 2 would be greatly appreciated"
