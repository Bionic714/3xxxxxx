,subgenius,2006-12-29T01:28Z,"All this ""ORENJi"" shit has corrupted rar files, seems like every one I get."
,Sturmo,2006-12-31T01:09Z,downloaded with uTorrent 1.6. Unrar'd with winrar 3.50. No problems.
,B1TG0D,2007-01-09T14:50Z,"subgenius  the problem is that the program , y belive you are using BitComet, shows you that it finished downloading, reaching 100%, but in fact it's not true !!! Give the comand (by right cliking) ""manual hash check"" then it will show the reall progres !!!

It's a stupid BUG !"
,mbmalone,2007-01-19T02:35Z,"thanks TiAMO

I do not have access to watch the show on TV and I appreciate very much your postings."
,kegger309,2007-02-09T07:55Z,"According to the hash check with ABC 3.1, torrent is complete, but still can't unpack it w/ winrar... anyone else having this problem?"

,hillbourne,2008-03-28T06:00Z,"Well, yet another mis-labeled torrent. This one is S03E10 Eye of Jupiter. I wish people would stop RARing the files too. It just takes up extra space on my HD while I am seeding. It's a video file folks- already compressed!"
