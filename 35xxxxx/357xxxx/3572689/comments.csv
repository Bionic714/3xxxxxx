,jcharliem,2007-01-22T03:24Z,"stuck at 99/9%. wont dl 4 files.

perhaps theyll come in a while.. any of you guys having the same problem?"
,reaperfudo,2007-01-28T20:43Z,"About the quality:

This is not a digital-to-digital HQ rip.  Like, DVD->XviD/mp3 or something.

I don't know what kind of rip this is, but it seems like it's from a theatre... there's an analog step in there.

However, the video quality, considering it's poor choice, is completely watchable.  VHS quality, i would wager, maybe a little better.

The sound is not great, but it's listenable.   There's terrible balance, the midrange frequencies are boosted too much.  Plus, there's a terrible cheap compressor on the audio, boosting gain in the quiet parts, and turning the volume down again with loud sounds, like gunshots, or explosions.  This is a bond movie, so that happens all the time.

So, quality is not 9/10, more like 6/10, but if you can look past the shortcomings, you'll be satified."
