,Prvritvs,2006-12-27T16:10Z,"Thanks a lot, this is truly a classic!!"
,Klasic Kumputerz,2007-09-18T23:07Z,"This movie is in English as primary audio language. The menu system is in English. It is PAL DVD5. Region code is unknown. This is in wide screen format. The movie is in a ?VIDEO_TS? folder that are VOB, IFO & BUP DVD files and playable on a DVD player that reads DVDR?s & PAL. It has other audio languages & subtitles. There are special features. Excellent video & audio quality. Seeding is very very slow and took me 7 days to download."
