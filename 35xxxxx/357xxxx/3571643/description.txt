Nearly three decades after his untimely death in September 1970, Jimi Hendrix's legendary performances with 

the Band Of Gypsys remain one of his most impressive achievements.

The revolutionary impact Jimi Hendrix, Billy Cox and Buddy Miles had upon the boundaries and definitions of

rock, R&B and funk can be traced to four concerts over the course of two evenings. The story of this

groundbreaking music is told here in interviews with Jimi, and for the first time, all four of his 

bandmates, Mitch Mitchell, Noel Redding, Billy Cox and Buddy Miles. Among those also contributing are

Lenny Kravitz, Vernon Reid, Slash and original engineer Eddie Kramer.

January 1, 1970 concerts which have not been included as part of Band Of Gypsys or Jimi Hendrix. Live At
