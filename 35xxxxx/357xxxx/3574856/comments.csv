Sorry about the speed..... blame my ISP!!!"
,drteeth,2006-12-12T00:13Z,Torchwood started with such potential and promise...it's such a let down.
,truthseekers,2006-12-12T01:05Z,"I will forgive this series any crimes because A: I am Welsh and understand the in jokes... theres a lot of deeper stuff in there is going to fly over peoples heads and turn some people away.

However if you get it, you really get it. Torchwood is good but you have to be immersed in some of its background, either SciFi or Welshness... then it all makes perfect sense. 

I havent watched this episode yet but Im guessing it wont be a total letdown as you suggest. 

I did think that  the episode with the canibals wasnt very PARANORMAL though... hehe.

But who says every case Totchwood has to deal with has to be paranormal eh. hehe."
,truthseekers,2006-12-12T01:06Z,Oh yeah and B:  Being Welsh I am a bit thick and a sheepshagger so fitting stereotypes shoukld be listened to anyhow ;-) hehe. SUBGENUIS RULES!

,truthseekers,2006-12-12T04:42Z,Perhaps a time travekl experiment went wrong and zapped it hehe.
,i<3supernova,2006-12-12T05:18Z,"Torchwood is a brilliant piece of adult scifi.  There are so many in jokes and Doc Who refs, screw the small minds that can't deal with it."

,chauncey_freak,2006-12-14T14:04Z,"Thanks a million Dave! 
I agree the last 2 episodes were a bit weak, but only cos we were expecting so much! I'm Irish, and know a Welshie, so i get a few of the in-jokes, funny as hell. This is the show that we would make if we could, i guess. Hurrah!"
