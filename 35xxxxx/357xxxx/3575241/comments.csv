Here is a little extra info on the site:
""The Internet Archive is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that was founded to build an Internet library, with the purpose of offering permanent access for researchers, historians, and scholars to historical collections that exist in digital format. Founded in 1996 and located in the Presidio of San Francisco, the Archive has been receiving data donations from Alexa Internet and others. In late 1999, the organization started to grow to include more well-rounded collections. Now the Internet Archive includes texts, audio, moving images, and software as well as archived web pages in our collections."""

  Anyone have any ideas?
 the set sounds great! new stuff to be honest im getting sick of me and my uncle, loser , and deal in every GD release since 95'. all the dicks picks and from the vault's are getting so old.
  this set sounds very refreshing."
