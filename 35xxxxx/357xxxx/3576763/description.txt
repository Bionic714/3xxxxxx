Release Notes:

Produced by Frank Rogers, Here and Now features thirteen new
songs, all penned by Darryl Worley and friends.

Darryl Worley today is his own man, in control of his music and
his life. He looks the way he wants to look. He's writing and
singing the songs he wants to sing. He has hooked up with an
artist-friendly record label, the mid-sized 903 Music. A full 360
degree view of Worley as a writer and artist is clearly evident on
Here and Now.

There's a new exuberance in his declarations of personal and
professional independence with titles like Jumpin' Off the Wagon,
Free, Living In the Here and Now, and Nothin' To Lose.

There's honesty, too, and compassion, in stories he pulls from
life on songs like Slow Dancing with a Memory, and Things I'll
Never Do Again.

Then there's that steamy tale on Ain't Nothin' but a Love Thang,
and party songs like Party Song and Whiskey Makes the World Go
Round, and more surprises to boot.

Worley comments, "A thread runs through this album: that sense of
freedom that comes not only from within but also through things
you experience in your life. When so many changes happen on the
outside, they're bound to affect you on the inside too. So these
songs don't come from the same Darryl Worley you've had the
opportunity to meet and get to know." He continues, "It's not just
new music or a new direction. This is a somewhat different guy
who's gone through a lot and come to a place where I want to let
some of the seriousness go and help people laugh, smile, and have
a good time."

But while there is an abundance of good time music on this album,
it's emotional centerpiece is the emotionally-charged I Just Came
Back (From a War), inspired by a Marine that Worley met who was
having a difficult time adjusting to life back home after being at
battle in Iraq. The song, about compassion and understanding, is
shooting up the Country radio charts and garnering national media
attention.

Worley performs the song tonight when he headlines Eagle
Appreciation Day at Fort Campbell, organized to say thank you to
all the 101st Airborne Division soldiers and their families for
their hard work and the sacrifices they endure on a daily basis.

After recent coverage in The New York Times and Reuters, street
week media for Here and Now includes Associated Press Television;
USA Today; The Today Show: Weekend Edition (11/19); MSNBC.com; a
television special on Great American Country (11/19 - 11/22); CMT
330 Sessions (11/21); AT&T blue room performance (11/21); and a
Jones Radio World Premiere, among others.

Darryl Worley debuted on the Country charts with a trio of top-15
hits in 2000-01: When You Need My Love, A Good Day to Run, and
Second Wind. His breakthrough year was 2002 when Worley's touching
ballad I Miss My Friend, the title tune to his second CD, became
his first No. 1 hit. After he spent Christmas 2002 entertaining
America's troops in Afghanistan, Kuwait and Uzbekistan, he came
home and wrote the patriotic anthem Have You Forgotten?, which
became his second No. 1 song and remained at the top of the charts
for six weeks. In the summer of 2004, Awful Beautiful Life was
released and soon rocketed up the country music charts to become a
multi-week No. 1 record in January 2005.
