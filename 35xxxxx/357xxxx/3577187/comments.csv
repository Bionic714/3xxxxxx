,kevster1976,2010-01-26T07:00Z,"Great torrent. Good quality rips! And very informative documentaries. Shows the whole scope of the mob from the early days of bootlegging through to the most lucrative racket of Heroin in the 80s
This must of been quite shocking when it was first broadcast back in the 80s in the UK (you can tell by the LWT logo!), but well worth it.
In the last episode, it tells little about the rise of Columbian Drug Barons/dealers in Miami, but if your interested in this, i suggest you checkout the doc Cocaine Cowboys by Billy Corben (2007). You'll be Blown away. A must!
