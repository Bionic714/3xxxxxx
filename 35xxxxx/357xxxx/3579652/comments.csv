,Mind.tfk,2008-09-11T15:14Z,Go and scan every keygen that you download and I'm positive that it will show up as some kind of spyware or virus dick head.
,davistoms,2008-10-24T08:28Z,"Thanks for the upload. Its working great. I am using a pirated XP n microst detected it. I used this to change my key to the one give by rmd. Thanks dude, its working great. Sorry bill gates v r not interested to spend money for ur XP."
,mitic888,2009-01-31T09:27Z,"100% VIRUS
I did run it on a test computer and many applications did not work anymore. 
I had to format and reinstall, contains a rootkit, not revealed by every av."
,mantaker,2009-03-17T08:54Z,Dear MOFOs ;)).. This is not a virus.. This is a wonderful software from MagicJellyBean.. Later microsoft acquired the product and destroyed.. Now only key finder is available and not key changers..
,mantaker,2009-03-17T08:55Z,mitic888 :)).. Do you know anything about virus or rootkits??? Get outta here you cocksucker......
,farmerb333,2009-03-30T00:05Z,"mitic888 you are a n00b.

This worked well on my machine that had been running the V2C47... xp key for years that MS (finally) have now black listed."
,mitic888,2009-04-03T01:36Z,"i confirm, it contains a rootkit.

The worse family of virus that ever existed.
Beware of it. "
,coolguy_d,2009-04-16T15:53Z,"Thanks Mind.tfk! Just used it, all is good here! also had the V2C47 key,now blacklisted.  As far as i can see no Viruses in this!!!"
,mitic888,2009-04-20T06:23Z,rootkits are not visible but still are viruses
,jimbx,2009-06-10T09:30Z,"Because of my job i have been able to test this program on 5 different computers.
It is a virus.
All of them required a re-installation, one came back under the arm of a customer who reported the system to be unstable.

This is a virus. Beware"
,Fito33,2010-01-18T13:45Z,"Thankyou  ***rmd*** , key works fine :)"
,LukeScooto,2011-07-19T06:47Z,You are bigger shithead then Mind.tfk if you actually installed this piece of shit rootkit. Funny how douchy these 15 year olds who believe that if its on TPB it must be good. They're so fucking poor/nigga rich that they cant spring for the cheapest software in the world and have to get desperate and use shit with rootkits in it. Fucking tools.
