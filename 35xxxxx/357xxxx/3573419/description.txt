My apologies for the first one I didn't test it first this one will autoplay and is an awesome directory tree file.

From M$ themselves. Training for retail consumer manufacturers. Geared towards Tech Support for the consumer. This is great info on the newest in the line of OS's from M$. Everything form HOW-TO'S to HOW-NOT-TO's. Designed to push out to manufacturer Tech Support, for the beginner to the higher level user. What can I say everthing M$ won't support but let the retailers do. I can't say enough about this material for what is out there now. Haven't seen any instruction manuals better than this. Everything the new Vista can and cant do. Step by step guides on how to break it and to fix it. Good stuff.
