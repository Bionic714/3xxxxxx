,genghis_khan_92,2008-01-23T01:34Z,Can anyone tell me why the subtitles end 45 min before the movie ends?
,RaymondW,2008-03-09T16:08Z,"You need to go into the srt file and find the timing error and correct it. Just look for the time frame that is out of sync. It's easy to fix, you'll just need to 'guesstamate' on the time. This is a great movie."
,777shanktime777,2008-05-22T09:24Z,you can open the srt in a notepad. look at the numbers and you will see which one needs to be changed.
,footballcolumns,2008-08-22T17:54Z,"To fix the subtitle timing error:
Open the subtitle file for CD2 in Notepad. 
Do a 'Find' for the line ""No, tiger always run until die.""
You'll notice the times for the next line are way out of range. Fix these by putting values that are less than those on the next line.
Save the file and close.

Great Upload otherwise, thanks to kegir and the fine folks at freakyflicks."

,Kara-kan,2011-08-26T19:40Z,"Man, if you cannot upload the correct subtitles don't upload the movie at all, or at least warn those who don't understand Russian not to download this torrent. Is this so hard to understand.
I now have wasted my time and bandwidth to download a crap. And no, the subs on opensubs.com are OK either."
,radioman-lt,2012-05-10T09:49Z,subtitles are ok
