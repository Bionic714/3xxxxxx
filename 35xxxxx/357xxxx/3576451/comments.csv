,scott523,2006-12-19T03:22Z,"Yep, I aggree with seattle29. The CDMaker is a must. However, that would require a username/password. :X"
,gemigene,2006-12-19T21:56Z,"CDMaker is available here:

However, no seeds yet..."
[V],dalmas67,2006-12-22T10:21Z,UrsĂ¤kta en nybĂśrjare men hur Ăśppnar man filen licenskey?
,spiralgirl,2006-12-24T06:25Z,"Hi,  What is the license key for this?  I know it is included but it is a exe file which can't be opened on a Mac.  I get so many of these files that are keygen and are exe type that I can't open so I end up looking all over the net to find them.

Thanks,

S."
,dogday,2006-12-27T20:12Z,"the licence key is a file that contains registration information. you are not required to copy+paste anything from it. just choose ""i have registration file"" when idefrag asks you to register, then point it to idefrag.licensekey and ka-poof, you're on your way to defrag heaven."
,spiralgirl,2006-12-28T00:36Z,"Dogday,

You are brilliant.  Thanks so much for that tip.

,toliman,2007-01-16T17:51Z,"thanks for including cdmaker. 

i've just been using a bootable cd (tiger rescue dvd) and running it from there, but this should be considerably faster. i think. "
,Kilamite,2008-11-14T18:54Z,"Thanks.

Trying to get CD Maker though, no one is seeding!"
,Pessimistic1,2009-04-29T22:21Z,For those of you that have difficulty with windows files on a mac ... get Parallels Desktop (at least with OS X) ... It's great for running Windows on a Mac. I downloaded it from here and will try to post the torrent but you should be able to easily find it. 
,ronky123,2009-10-11T08:43Z,please seed...
