,Dusha,2006-12-06T22:19Z,"Map appear to be FAKE!!!! 

All files are dated with Sept. 2005"
,Smurf1969,2006-12-06T23:14Z,"Absolutely NO FAKE! It's the file dowloaded by TomTom Home and, believe me, there are many, many updates... expecially roundabouts...
(yes... I'm italian)!"

,bjoeern,2006-12-08T20:08Z,How do i activate?
,fransfl,2006-12-09T10:04Z,Use the tomtom version 6.02 you can find here in piratebay
,Smurf1969,2006-12-09T18:06Z,"For PalmOS I used this http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3573778/Tt6_Kg_4_c4Pda_-_Keygen_Tomtom_6_Mobile.zip
(the above keygen was extracted from the bigger archive http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3523689/tomtom_6_for_Palm)
Not tested on other PDA, please comment here if it works!"
