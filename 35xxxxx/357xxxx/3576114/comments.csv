{[REQ]Image.Line.Fruity.Loops.Studio.Producer.Edition.XXL.v6.04-TALiO} contains a Trojan in the patcher file. The name of the Trojan is {Win32: Small-AMI[Trojan]}. You may wish to scan your computer if u have already opened the file, if not then just delete it. We the staff and Uploaders at A**** are very sorry for this inconvenience. We have now dealt with the problem and we will continue making sure all our torrent files are safe and free from any
adware/trojan/virus."
