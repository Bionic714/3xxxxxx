,frezecemen,2008-04-29T14:44Z,thanks for up
,socios343,2008-04-29T22:29Z,No problem. Very easy to install. 
,Argirisnikos,2008-05-02T04:59Z," I Have Downloaded This , And I Can't Complete The Installation , and  says that message: "" Doomsday is not installed on your computer . please install the game before installing the update . the installation will now exit ."" Please Help me .  What I can Do? :/"
,KillerPriest,2008-05-22T14:44Z,"I am kind of new to this and I cant get it to install either, I however believe the problem is me, and not the torrent. Advice is appreciated."
,xantos[swe],2008-05-30T08:13Z,This is just an Expansion
,fuzzyfurret,2008-08-22T17:45Z,"This is a stand alone expansion, no need for HoI 2."
,Vladimir28,2008-09-18T22:04Z,"So I mounted the .bin file and began the install, but my computer says there's a virus.  Since no one else has commented on this, I would assume my anti virus software is over reacting, but I was wondering if anyone could confirm that there is no virus?"
,Thorsi,2008-09-18T23:09Z,"You're right, Vlad, AVG found a trojan after I installed it. This is a great game, but don't download this exact torrent!"
,jacksparr0w,2008-10-13T09:18Z,"This woks great !
No viruses or trojans
Mount the .bin file using any virtual CD application like daemon tools and start installation.
After that apply upgrades."
,Dennis_med_D,2008-11-24T19:44Z,"eh no cue file?

Can't mount a bin without cue?"
,tomhax,2008-12-17T14:30Z,"Dennis, choose ""show all files"" in daemon tools and mount the bin!"
,abc123star,2009-01-16T14:22Z,which program shall i open this with? :D
,skyman299,2009-04-05T03:30Z,winiso worked for me
,dekkn,2009-05-29T18:02Z,"Just change the name on the bin file to nrg. Then you will find it on deamon tools. (make sure you have a copy before, if something goes wrong)"
,KoRneY,2009-06-28T05:55Z,"You don't need to change the file name, just have daemon tools look for all files and load the .bin directly."
,Adept.,2010-02-04T17:18Z,Thanks for seeding :D
