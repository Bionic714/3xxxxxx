,jorgeko,2007-01-21T05:24Z,Does anyone know how to install this on a Palm?
,madcowsonthewall,2007-01-27T19:07Z,"""unzip"" the file, e.g. with winrar
copy the content to an empty Sd-card
add maps
use keygen for the activation code
add voices with Tom Tom home (this can be downloaded for free from the Tom Tom website > open the software with the sd card still in the card reader > select the sd-card as your GPS device > install some voices (you'll get stuck indeed if you don't install any voices)
Put the sd card in your palm > use the activation code keygen generated (or generate it now, if you didn't have the product code)
Worked (with a bit of trouble) for my Palm Tx!"
