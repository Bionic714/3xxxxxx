From 1986, Greg Stump's third skiing extravaganza, featuring lots of the old school freestyle skiers. Special appearance by the mohawk man himself, Mr Glen Plake. While Glen is not in the credits and only appears briefly in the film, there is no mistaking him. This may have been his first film appearance. Also of note is a 16 year old Shawn Palmer, at the first ever snowboad world competition, plus skateboarding by a fairly young Tony Hawk and Lance Mountain.

Quite amazing how these guys could freestyle on their long thing boards, eh?

Another fine YoYo42 rip from the original VHS tape. Enjoy
