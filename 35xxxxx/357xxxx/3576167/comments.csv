,ossgrouch,2006-12-22T20:52Z,"I haven't tried it yet, but this is what Total Idea says of their Trial Versions:

Most of our products are based on the ""try-before-buy"" idea - that's why we offer fully functional trial versions of our products (except subscription services - read below).

We go to great lengths to produce a trial version with which customers can ensure their satisfaction and system compatibility. This allows our customers to make an informed purchasing decision."
