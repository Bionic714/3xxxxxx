,Zirak_90,2006-12-11T12:55Z,This episode was great. Its the best episode of season 18. Other ones sucked except episode 1.
[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-11T13:11Z,"Yes, the 18'th season has been lousy, like if they're out of ideas. But this episode's got a straight story to tell, and is actually pretty good. :)"
,Hezkore,2006-12-11T14:24Z,Maybe they've used up all the good ideas for the movie? ;D
,berny_91,2006-12-11T14:53Z,"Let's hope so =P (That the movie will be good that is)

Anyways, thank you! =D"
