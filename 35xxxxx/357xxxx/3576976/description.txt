Molly Star-Racer

I found this on [Live-Evil]'s tracker the other day, and it took me awhile to DL it as nobody was fully seeding it.  However when I did finally get it, it didn't work.  The sound was royally screwed up, and the video was very choppy and nothing was playing correctly.  

After a few hrs of tweaking the original file I was able to re-encode it and make the video and sound sync together and play perfectly!  Unfortunately the file-size is double the original....best I could do to fix it for now.

~ As usual I am super-seeding this file, but TorrentSpy doesn't always detect me, so I fluctuate in/out as a seed being present!


This is the original-original concept trailer of Oban Star-Racers before Oban was adopted.  As you will see its quite different than what Oban turned out to be, but still its really neat and I'm sure fans of Oban will be interested in checking this out...
