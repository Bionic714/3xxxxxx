,McKnuckles,2006-12-08T20:07Z,"Always try to upload at least as much as you download. Thats the way to keep the bittorrent network alive. Having a share ratio above 1.0 means you have uploaded more than you have downloaded, which is good.When you have 100 % and dont have a ratio above 1.0, just wait and more peers might connect. If there hasn't been any new peers for a few days, you may disconnect even though your ratio is bad."

,ob1ken,2007-10-31T18:51Z,"To burn this you need a program to unpack the iso file into .vob, .ifo and .bup files which defines the dvd. At least that is what i do to burn it in NERO. Maybe there is other programs that burns it directly."
,organicdogger,2007-11-02T08:28Z,"if you go to blockbuster online and start doing searching under ambient and nature you can find many relaxing titles, some with music and some without. they even have looped footage from space. "
