,KiiMH,2007-12-07T14:52Z,What do i do when setup ask`s me to insert disc2??
,tillisbergis,2007-12-23T06:59Z,"I didn't care about the requestion abut disc 2, but I've got the same problem with the sound as everybody else. I'll fix it this way (it gotta be a better way to do it). When you have extractad all files in winrar you open the folder named Patch, in there is a zip-file or something named ""InternationalPatch"" I can't open it right away, but when I open it in winrar it contains a exe-file (think it is the crack?) I'll open the file in winrar, and got sound!!! enjoy! "
,primitive22,2008-01-07T19:20Z,Can anyone tell how to put the sound working?

,NoneOfYouAreReal,2008-03-16T12:52Z,"i didnt bother with daemon tools - i just opened up the rar and ran the install exe - installed fine

it does run very slow and sound is a bit shitty -  not prob with my comp cos i have (legal) commandos 3 and it works perfectly

btw guys theres loads of seeders now (incl. me!)"
,Axlhammer,2008-04-14T10:25Z,"I tried to do what tillisbergis said, but it just comes a message saying ""files updated succesfully"". Still no sound. Anyone have any idea? And btw, does anyone have a clue where i can find Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines (nr. 1)? Found a version at mininova, but it was with disabled saving and loading functions..."

...tried tillisbergis' solution of going through RAR...
...still no sound...
any clues anyone?"
,AdamJeff,2009-03-16T23:06Z,"ok, it took me a couple of hours to figure out this retardedly simple fix for the sound issue everyone has.
dont start the game from the torrent folder you extracted.
start the game from the commandos 2 folder on your C drive.
and it works....
wierd"
