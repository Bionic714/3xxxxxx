ALREADY AN EVE ONLINE PLAYER? JOIN SNIGGWAFFE!
You can kill without remorse and derive pleasure from the death of hundreds of innocent pilots.
SniggWaffe is open again for your pirating pleasure. This corporation is to serve as a training ground for potential Snigg.erdly recruits and eventually a corp that can hold its own in a fight.
For those of you who don't know us, SNIGG is one of the oldest active pirate corps left in EVE. We do it all, belt piracy, gate camping, ransoming, sentry tanking, sniping, fleet ops, and small gangs, both in 0.0 and empire. So if you want to come learn how to pirate from some of the best in the game then SniggWaffe is the place for you.
The minimum requirement is that you can use electronic warfare or propulsion jamming. If you can't warp scramble or jam/sensor dampen then you won't be of much use. But these skills don't take long to train, so get to it! Also, a Microphone will be REQUIRED.
This is NOT AN ALT CORP. I will not be accepting known alts from any major corporations in EVE. If you happen to have an alt char who keeps a low profile somewhere and just makes a little isk on the side that is fine, but if we find out that you are actively PvP'ing or involved in politics with your other character then you will be promtply removed from Snigg/Sniggwaffe.
Want to be a pirate, join the ""sniggwaffe hr"" channel in game.
Recruitment Officers:
US: Drako Markam, Barock, Seth Rock
Euro: Narciss, Schroni
Asia/ANZ: Mulla Nasrudin"
