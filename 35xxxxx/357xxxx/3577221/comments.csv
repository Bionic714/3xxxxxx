,ClarkCable,2006-12-15T15:08Z,Do u need a new serial or can u use CS2 serials?
,fjerkon,2006-12-15T15:14Z,It will work without serial for a shorter period of time. The beta will stop working in 30 days even whit serial. Use the cs2 serial. There will probably be another beta o two before the release.
,ClarkCable,2006-12-15T15:18Z,"Cool!
My MacBook Pro has been waiting for this one!"
,theadman,2006-12-15T16:03Z,"This will only work for 2 days. 

Where is the CS3 licence code?"
,lumixxx,2006-12-15T16:05Z,Anybody have a serial yet?
,cactuskid,2006-12-15T16:16Z,"""A licensed copy of Photoshop CS2, Creative Suite 2, Production Studio, Adobe Web Bundle, or Adobe Video Bundle is required to use this technology beyond a two-day trial period. After installation you will be prompted to enter a CS3 beta serial number for Photoshop. To obtain a beta serial number, visit www.adobe.com/go/photoshopcs3beta_serialnumber and enter your CS2 serial number.""

,mickflip,2006-12-15T16:17Z,Now we need a cs2 serial =P
,theadman,2006-12-15T16:25Z,"I've tried about 10 different CS2 serials on the Adobe site? all of which work fine for CS2 but Adobe says:

'Sorry, but the serial number you entered is not eligible for the Photoshop CS3 Beta download. Please try your Photoshop CS2 serial number again, or, if you do not own a license for Photoshop CS2, you can purchase one on Adobe.com and use the serial number to download the Photoshop CS3 Beta.'"
,theadman,2006-12-15T17:18Z,"No good. Says:

'The maximum number of activations allowed for this copy of Adobe Photoshop CS3 has been reached.'

Anyone have another code?"

Thanks for seeding, but it seems like you've been seeding 1/3 of the files 3times. You have u/l more MB than the file is, but not all pats of the file. Please continue seeding. Maby check your preferences in your torrent application too. Try to seed to few people with higher speed to each instead..."

,agent_monkey,2006-12-16T09:52Z,"sometimes visiting this place just to read the comments is worth the price of admission. i.e. ""I've tried about 10 different CS2 serials on the Adobe site? all of which work fine for CS2 but won't enable the CS3 beta, blah blah blah, i don't have a clue why my ill-gotten booty pirated version of CS2's serial # won't work to lemme freeload a bit more and use this beta for more than 2 days,"" etc etc. comical   ;)"
,ehdp5,2006-12-16T12:57Z,Does anyone has a CS3 or even a working CS2 serial now ? I'v tried many CS2 serials but no one works. I didn't find ant CS3 working yet.

,troisd,2006-12-20T02:20Z,"I love reading these funny comments.  Header says it all... ""Type:Mac"".  But unbeknowest to some, it IS possible to use this DMG with a PC... how you may ask?  OSx86!!!  That's right, OS X 10.4.8 in your trusty ole PC.  Mileage may vary depending on your hardware.  Google for osx86 and free your PC from Uncle Bill's deadly fat grasp!"

I installed with serial:

but it asks for Activation Code ! Any ideias ?"
,agent_monkey,2006-12-22T04:59Z,"i'd be careful if you use a crack to patch this...adobe has a dev3 workaround where this app does a page/call using a handler daemon for low-level packets and it is notifying adobe of ip's using this beta w/o valid reg's. and yeah, little snitch won't warn you because of the page/call handling. just a thought. biscuits."
,agent_monkey,2006-12-22T05:06Z,"wait, correction - my bad...that should read that they're using a quantum-slice low-level glutamate vector that's parsing out to the mac 501/root account on your os a request to route dmca tertiary checksums to adobe. roger, biscuits. over, under, knuckle."
,Heartcore,2006-12-26T13:23Z,wohoo ! I've been waiting for this. thanks man. works perfectly for me. used the patch uploaded here on piratebay too.
