[T],IndianChristian,2008-07-11T20:31Z,"Look who's talking. 
Everything about Jesus came out of the mouth of Muhammad, a self proclaimed prophet who lived some 600 years after Jesus. 
And was Muhammad a prophet?
The Islamic Sunnah which Muslims hold to be saced and is the basis of the Islamic laws portray Muhamamd as a murderer, a bandit, a womanizer, a molester and much much more? So how can I believe what this imposter prophet had to say about Jesus Christ?

Here is the article on the Truth about Muhammad. 
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4253037/The_Truth_about_Muhammad
It also includes one booklet on the Truth about the Islamic Jesus - the lies Muhammad told about Jesus."
,peacekeeper77,2009-08-19T22:56Z,"Muslims will never speak against Moses or Jesus (My peace be on them). please before commenting read Quran first. suicide bombers or terrorists are not mulims. We believe in Peace and believe in freedom of religion. can anyone anwer why Islam is best spread religion even in US. Even after 9 / 11 coz peole accepting Islam after studying Islam not bcoz of Idiot osama bin laden. islam considers killing of one innocent as killing of whole humanity. Hitler was not muslim he was christian so do I have a right to consider all christians as Hitler. Definately NO. Same is with us, acts of terror is different and fight for Right is different. If you fight for a right cause you are never terrorist. plz read Islam before making any comment which can harm you. May peace and blessing of Allah be with you all. "
,rudaba7,2010-01-07T18:07Z,our beloved Prophet(pbuh) was a perfect human being if you read his lifestory you woud not have said these stuff and if you really want to know Islam then read the quran with the help of a scholar cause you really dont know what you are talking about. IF JESUS (PBUH) WAS REALLY THE SON OF GOD WHY DIDNT HE SPEAK A WORD ABOUT WOMENS RIGHTS WHAT ABOUT SLAVES RIGHTS AND SO MUCH MORE. THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT CONTRADICT IN THE BIBLE AND SOME THAT DO NOT MAKE SENSE. if you really want to correct islam then fisrt go answer questions about religion and thwn point fingers on others
