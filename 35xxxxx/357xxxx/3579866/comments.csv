,teh_dudezorz,2007-01-03T21:35Z,Are you going to upload the other DVD? Please do!
,ORG_WK,2007-01-21T18:30Z,did you get this to work with just one dvd?...cause i didnt or is there a trick or something?
,ORG_WK,2007-01-21T18:53Z,i just cant find any instruments on the list :/
,teh_dudezorz,2007-01-23T20:25Z,"You have to check ""Relist on start up"" in the prefs of the Miroslav VST plugin. That will make it detect the instruments when you start it again.

Basically, you set up Miroslav, use the keygen, setup the instruments, use the 1.1 sounds updater, then make Miroslav detect the instruments, and either just perform for fun with the standalone version, or compose something using it as a VST instrument in a sequencer like Acid or Cubase.

Also, make sure that in the prefs, Miroslav's instrument root folder is set correctly.

It works for me fine, but for the real cool stuff, I'd need the other DVD, too."

,Fredrish,2007-07-01T00:38Z,"What the... I've been trying to download this for hours, yet it hasn't moved an inch. There's supposed to be seeders? Crap..."
,andolatut,2007-09-27T00:15Z,"Detta verkar ju va fantastiskt! Men...
Jag har laddat ner o installerat allt, men programmet hittar inte ljudfilerna. De kom ju som två stora ISO-filer. Ska man dela upp dem med nåt verktyg i småfiler? I så fall vilket verktyg? Hur gör man annars? Det funkar varken när jag kör det i Nuendo som vsti eller som stand alone. Snälla hjälp, jag vill så gärna att det ska funka."
,andolatut,2007-09-27T00:21Z,"This seems really great!!! But...
I´ve downloaded and installed everything, but the program doesn´t find the sound files. They came as two big ISO-files. Are you supposed to split them up into smalles files with some tool, and if that is the case, which tool? How do you do otherwise? It doesn´t work neither as a vsti in Nuendo nor as a stand alone. Please help, I really want this to work!!!"

,Technojedi,2008-05-13T09:21Z,"What the hell!!!
Half of the dvd instruments (for example strings) is saying ""this is no miroslav instrument and it can not be loaded""

Please help me with this one because I tried everything to run these instruments."
,biztoe,2008-05-30T14:56Z,Hi. have you tried to mount (daemon tools) the rar files when you install the sound dvd's? I had the same problem as you because I unrared the dvd's and then installed them. Then I tried to mount the rar files and install them from the simulated cd-roms....and then it worked:D
,Technojedi,2008-07-01T03:55Z,"Thanx Biztoe,

I've mounted the dvd's and dvd 2 is now running as it should.

But later i installed dvd 1 and suddenly al those samples can't be loaded. There appears an massage that i need the 1.1 update but i installed this one serveral times.

Damn, Why doesn't this program work entirely   "
,Technojedi,2008-07-01T13:43Z,"Amen!

I downloaded the installer again, installed it again, and suddenly both sounddvd's are working like a horny horse.

Finally"
,dartb,2008-07-15T22:32Z,"Hmm, upon extraction at 9% I have 5 errors.

!   C:\Torrent Downloads\Miroslav Philarmonik Sound DVD 1\Miroslav Philarmonik Sound DVD 1.r00: Invalid or corrupt authenticity information

And so on and so forth.  7zip gives the same problem.

Any ideas, guys?"
,dartb,2008-08-09T17:01Z,"I finally got around to redownloading it and it still has the same errors.  I let it extract and it works absolutely fine.

This program just continues to amaze me."
