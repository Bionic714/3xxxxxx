,drgmdp,2006-12-19T23:33Z,"i have a 256K connection, i do what i can
it's not a problem is a feature :P"
,lighter,2006-12-21T00:26Z,"It's no problem as long as you hang in there 'til a couple of others finish :) It shure looks as if it's gonna take a while, though.
I hope that you're only seeding to max 4-5 at the time and you're super-seeding?! If you don't, both those tricks should speed up things (it doesn't look like you're super-seeding, everybody's got the same fragments of the torrent)."
,drgmdp,2006-12-21T01:47Z,"sure i will ;)
how's that superseeding thing? sounds super."
,lighter,2006-12-21T14:33Z,"It's usually in the setup of your bittorrent client. In Azureus it's Tools/Settings/cue/uploads and then check the super-seed box. I've translated the path from swedish, but in essence it should be rigth. When super-seed is activated you should be sending different parts of the torrent to everybody connected to you, and then those people can take this bits from each other, and not only from you. 
If you have another client, post it here. I'm sure someone who has the right knowledge will help.
Thanx for uploading anyways!"
,drgmdp,2006-12-21T21:48Z,utorrent for both creating the torrent and seeding
,lighter,2006-12-22T00:24Z,"Found this in the utorrent FAQ, does it help you?

Does ÂľTorrent support Super Seeding mode?
Yes, it does. Double click on the torrent and check the Initial Seeding box to turn it on. 

Please note that Super Seeding should ONLY be used if you are the -ONLY- seeder in the swarm, with no exceptions. It is also only effective with at least 2 peers in the swarm, and should generally not be used when you have high upload speeds."
,drgmdp,2006-12-22T01:57Z,"initial seeding enabled, let's see what happens
thanks for the tip"
,lighter,2006-12-22T11:33Z,yw. u might wanna restart the client too.
,drgmdp,2006-12-26T19:41Z,done. hope you like it
,PlasticFish,2007-08-19T20:31Z,Some of the song files are corrupted - please reseed. Thanks!
,wumpman,2008-04-08T04:48Z,Thanks for this!
,Bluestone,2008-05-27T23:53Z,"WARNING! There are a few blips and skips on this down....

Great sound otherwise....but very anoying and not pleasant to listen to...."
,imunionjack,2008-08-09T19:42Z,It woulda been much better in an mp3 format and as singles so we could download the tracks we wanted instead of the whole albums.
,imunionjack,2008-08-09T19:45Z,Please ignore that comment Im a plank!!! Thought I was commenting on another d/l ~ already had this so great ~ good share.
,Julien Xavier,2009-03-26T14:10Z,Downloading at 700 kbs. Super!
,ribit,2009-05-23T18:47Z,"I'm sorry I didn't take heed of the previous warnings. I guess they weren't clear enough. I'll try go make it clearer: This rip is A PIECE OF SHIT. ""Found a Job"" is unlistenable. There are errors on numerous other tracks which interrupt the flow (and enjoyment) of the song. If you don't mind SHIT quality or you're deaf, by all means download this one. For anyone else, don't waste your time."
,styxcreek,2012-08-19T18:34Z,haven't heard this since the mid 80's. looking forward to it. thanks!
