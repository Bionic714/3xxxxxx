fixes MelindaGates wrong vmx file

put this to your NEWLY unRARed vistakms "MelindaGates"
IMPORTANT, it must never have runned before

it corrects the wrong time parameters in the vmware image
only thing left to do after that is disable your 
firewall in both (vmware vista and plain vista)

link to melindagates kms vmware image:

good luck
