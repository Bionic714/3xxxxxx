There are four RAR-files that you unpack as usual. I've just tried it by my self and it worked fine. So what the fuck are you talkning about, that I upload stuff that doesn't work?

The files:
Pulp_Fiction_-_Soundtrack_Collectors Edition_RiP_manez.part1.rar
Pulp_Fiction_-_Soundtrack_Collectors Edition_RiP_manez.part2.rar
Pulp_Fiction_-_Soundtrack_Collectors Edition_RiP_manez.part3.rar
Pulp_Fiction_-_Soundtrack_Collectors Edition_RiP_manez.part4.rar"
