,torrenting,2006-12-15T18:26Z,"Quality on this is only decent. Picture is too dark and too bright at times and the colors are a little dull; typical camera quality. Sound is direct line. This release has been nuked for stolen audio from ORC; and ORC has also released Turistas.READNFO.REPACK.TELESYNC.XviD-ORC which may be a little better quality than this.
