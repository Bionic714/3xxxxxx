"The tenth edition of this essential reference presents new knowledge about the nutritional needs of swine that consider such factors as growth rate, carcass leanness, gender, health, environment, and repartitioning agents.
New sections are presented on requirements for amino acids and other nutrients. In addition, an original modeling approach to arriving at energy and amino acid needs for given animals is incorporated in this revision." 

"Nutrient Requirements of Swine covers:
Biological concepts that underlie nutrient needs for growth and function. New data on amino acid and energy requirements and the factors that shape them. New findings on lysine and the bioavailability of amino acids. New research results on minerals and vitamins. Nutrient composition of an expanded list of feedstuffs. The role of water in swine physiology, including factors that affect the quality of drinking water. Expanded tables of feed ingredients and their nutrient composition provide bioavailability estimates, fatty acid composition of fats typically used in swine diets, and important information on estimating the amino acid content of crude protein."



This torrent has just the book (pdf), I couldn't find the computer program, that is, I found it, but I couldn't make it work... I don't know if there's something wrong about the file itself or if it's something in my computer. (anyway, you can download it at http://newton.nap.edu/html/swinemodel/ ).


You can know more about the book in: http://newton.nap.edu/catalog/6016.html


If anyone by chance has the program, please share :)
