,Bon-Bon,2007-01-10T00:17Z,You have to remember that Norton PartitionMagic does not work on Windows 2003 although PowerQuest ParitionMagic does. This may be the reason this version is still being displayed.

Norton PartitionMagic is not that magical at all, cause it does not work on windows server 2003"
,user087,2008-10-08T22:52Z,"By the way!
PowerQuest PartitionMagic wont work with Windows Server 2003 either. 
The solution is:
EASEUS Partition Manager Server Edition"
