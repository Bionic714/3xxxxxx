,riffraffselbow,2008-09-12T08:50Z,"@radecoraccer: if you don't like it, don't download it. MST3k is for fans, and is not the right way to watch a movie you want to enjoy on it's own merits."
,sith256,2008-12-09T01:59Z,"all i'm going to say UMe2 is you are a geek god amongst geek gods

and radoracer get a life if you don't like this then try and find them on your owni'm pretty dang sure these b movies are un mst3k'd somewhere this was a niche comedy show in the late eighties in to the early nineties, we love it all and don't need to watch them without the commentaries"
