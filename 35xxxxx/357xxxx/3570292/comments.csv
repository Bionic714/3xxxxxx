In order for the keymaker to work follow these steps:
1)Install WinDVD
2)Register/Activate Now
3)Open the keymaker
   a)type in a valid email address [e.g. something@something.com]
   b)type in a random password
   c)click generate
4)input all of those 4 fields into the registration/activation window

And you are done... Fully activated DVD/Divx/mpeg/etc...."
