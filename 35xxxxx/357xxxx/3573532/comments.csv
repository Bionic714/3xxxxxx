Oh, explain to me a platypus... It is a wonderful creature that God made to set those that believe in evolution straight to creation.

I hope you come to see God created the world and I welcome you to download the movie in ISO format, burn it to DVD and watch it, turn it into a coaster if you will, but you may find it interesting if you watch it first.

I love you brother and so does Jesus."
