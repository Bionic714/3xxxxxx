A short-lived cartoon dealing with Doyle and Aimee, two Earthling students, who are chosen to attend a high school in outer space (Aimee for being the #1 student, Doyle for being a failure). Their lives change around as Doyle hardly makes any friends, and Aimee becomes popular. The two students befriend alien classmates and learn to get along with them, despite their differences.
