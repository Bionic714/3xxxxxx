,nymersic,2007-01-27T05:34Z,It pisses me off that I actually like this movie.  Surprisingly good.
,Zero_kenneth464,2007-02-03T18:31Z,"OMG fucking hate it.. i got caught by downloading this file, they are watching your ip suckers..

be careful pirats:D"
,blakekewl,2007-02-28T21:57Z,"shut up douche bag they didnt catch shat, besides its civil anyway if i ever got a letter saying they were suing me id just hide my computer at my friends hosue what r u gonna do now thats what i thought fuck u holloywood!"
,I8URFACE,2007-05-09T02:11Z,People do NOT download this. Find a different one. I am being completely honest when I say they are watching this torrent. I just got the letter from comcast today telling me that one more illegal download and they will drop me. Find another torrent to download. Good luck.
,chinupchild,2007-08-15T10:31Z,"Hey Blake.. Learn to spell. Holloywood? Dumbfuck. ""Hollywood"" isn't the one that watches the torrents anyway. Genius ass."
,lime3wire,2007-11-13T18:27Z,"thanks for the heads up,  much appreciated"
,Mirthander,2007-12-08T09:08Z,is it ok to download this one yet>?
,kzaf,2008-02-23T10:40Z,"They can try to hold me down to notload ""illegal"" downloads. But they cant do it .... 
First, why are they no deleting this website ? That should stop illigal downloading, so why they don't do this ? If they send me a letter i put Luke's Skywalkers lightsaber in their ass so they can finnaly have a fuck ;) 
Pfff, illegal :p"
,TheBigNoob,2008-04-02T23:11Z,"Holy crap. No one is watching your IP activity unless you live on a college campus like I do, which really goes to show how well they do watch. I have been a Pirate Bay user for two years now. The point is, people like Zero_kenneth464, I8URFACE are working for the RIAA or some organization like that to keep people from downloading. They need to be ignored. This torrent is fine."
,tommunist,2008-04-13T05:19Z,"TheBigNoob is right.  comcast is not watching your IP, they are measuring your bandwidth usage."
,xcrimsonprophecyx,2008-07-13T20:57Z,Get time warner high speed cable. I have it and I can tell you that those people have their heads shoved so far up their asses that Im almost positive that they don't moniter. Half of them can't seem to finish a simple task for us half of the time. Lol.
,Tremors12,2008-09-01T00:58Z,Well those governments are SEEDing nicely though
,ph7ryan,2009-01-15T04:18Z,"@nymersic

I don't mind...the plot isn't bad and the chicks are hott as FUCK!!!"
[T],despo1ler,2009-03-23T15:12Z,if you are worried about comcast or any other company getting your IP then you need to install peerguardian 2 to stop any of these anti copyright people from pinging ur IP

,hegel5000,2009-10-23T02:10Z,"Loving this movie is one of the gayest things I've ever done since being gay.  Totally worth it, though.

But yeah, Comcast is just being cheap and trying to save their bandwidth.  If you ever get a complaint from them, it's not because they care about piracy (because they produce no material and as such they don't care), but because piracy is about the only way to get the full value out of their absurd prices.  You pay dozens of dollars a month, you deserve a lot of bandwidth every minute of every day of those months."

,lebanese_warrior,2010-04-25T11:36Z,tell the leader of Comcast that il make his front yard look like school assembly...
,noidea2854,2010-11-06T14:09Z,awesome! No IP hunting on me... well I don't have comcast
,missypoof,2011-01-27T22:38Z,download Peerblock to block ip address. i had the same problem i got caught twice as well and was threatened with a fine if i dont stop downloading  since i downloaded peerblock i haven't received anymore of those nasty emails ha!
,Cynique,2011-03-16T01:14Z,"I fucking love living in Mexico, where this is illegal, but nobody does anything to stop it "
,craigbrian,2011-04-06T10:31Z,"I haven't been caught yet but i use BitTorent 6.4
and if you use PeerBlock at http://www.peerblock.com/

it DOUBLES your security EVEN ON WATCHED videos

but i would like to add, that i accentually downloaded this, i didn't read ALL the comments
and about half way threw the video it went all snowy for about 3 seconds. so its not  100% good quality

the Audio is a 10 tho"
,AndyU2k7,2011-09-07T09:58Z,How can anyone say it is illegal to download torrents? for all they know we have the DVD's. We just want a version on our computer...

,APirateNamedBrooke,2011-11-10T08:29Z,"(I know this is old) @kzaf They can't shut this site down. ;D ThePirateBay is doing nothing wrong, seeing as they're based in Sweden where the copyright laws are a bit different than say the US. Plus ThePirateBay stores no actual files on their site, just stuffs for bittorrent trackers. :)

As ThePirateBay says... No torrents have been deleted, and none ever will. 

As for this particular torrent, no problems for me soooo go fuck yourself to the idiots who're saying it's being watched.
