,joseph649,2006-12-08T02:19Z,"Nevermind the registration.  I got the revived torrent http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3512409/FL_Studio_v6.0.8._Registration_Revived
and replaced the reg gen in the program folder with this new one and everything works great!
Thanks!"

when you copy the crack files into the installed folder, so you will have a ""registered"" user!

It will now ask you for a new code, since every code last for one month! But we are going to trick Fruity Loops to think it hasn't been a month yet!

I usually turn back the time on my computer 10 years! easy to remember when I set it back after on! ;)

When I start the program with the time on my pc set 10 years back works everything perfectly... after the program has started can I turn it back =)

thats all n00bz"
