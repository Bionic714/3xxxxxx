,bad_name,2008-03-26T10:55Z,"Noobs who are asking how to patch, it's not complicated you only paste the patch into there you have installed it and run.

Intoo works fine no doubt about that, but i don't like the riping speed it's too slow Nero is twice faster than that.

THNX for the upload "
,RDB92,2008-03-31T19:54Z,"I don't get it. I pasted the file in the installation folder, but when I run it, it can't find the file ""UILib71U.dll"", while it's there. So when I could manually select the file, it still didn't work. Does anybody know why it doesn't work?"
,RDB92,2008-03-31T22:23Z,"Never mind, I had a newer version installed."
