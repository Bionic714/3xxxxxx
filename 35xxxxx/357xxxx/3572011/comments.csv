,Loser1979,2006-12-09T08:16Z,"the Chinese one was released in mid Nov. The one here come out on Dec 6. 
so I guess the one here maybe copied from the Chinese one. 

When a KMS server perform client activation for the very FIRST time, client number should be 25 at least (n>= 25). That means 25 PC connect to the KMS server and get activated at the same time.

Then the CMID code of each client PC will be recorded in the server, if a client doesn't connect back to the KMS server in 30 days,
then the server will have n count -1. 

the vmware image from the Chinese website has already activiated 40+ PC, so n count > 40.

if you use that version, you don't need 25 PC connected together. one is enough.

step by step on how to build your own KMS server can be found on many Chinese website, e.g.  http://www.jh75.com/article.asp?id=135

actually, i don't bother about building KMS server. There're few KMS servers available on the net anyway. Expect hundreds of KMS servers will appear on the net in half year.

,Bob_Daboob,2006-12-11T12:32Z,">>""Umm Did you use the cd key provided in the nfo when installing vista enterprise? Are you using the Echos release?""

Actually, the Enterprise version doesn't ask you for a key during installation.  In fact, if you go to the ""Change product key"" screen and try to use ""YFKBB - PQJJV - G996G - VWGXY - 2V3X8"" Windows will tell you that it's an ""invalid key for this version.""

I couldn't find the ""Business Edition"" of Vista, so I installed the Echos Enterprise release last night and then activated it using the Chinese server at kms.vbs.net.cn.  Works great.

,gluu,2006-12-11T19:32Z,"UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS 

The instructions have been changed a little bit from earlier... the new steps prevent the time from changing on the kms server, thus ensuring that there are always 41 computers connected when you try to activate and reactivate. Thanks to all those who helped put this method together. Those of you that test this, please let us know how this works. 

1. Perform a clean install of windows Business Edition using the key: 

XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX 

2. Once windows is installed, install VMware workstation and extract the windows KMS server image. 

a. Open the file Windows Vista (experimental).vmx in a text editor 
b. Add the following lines to this configuration file: 

tools.synchronize.continue=FALSE 
tools.synchronize.restore=FALSE 
tools.synchronize.resume.disk=FALSE 
tools.synchronize.shrink=FALSE 
rtc.startTime = ""1164286430"" 

c. Save and exit the .vxm file 

3. Disconnect from internet and routers, then reboot. 

4. Upon restarting, open vmware and choose to open (not run) the server image. 

5. On the word 'ethernet' on the right side of the screen double click and choose host only. (If youw ould like the image to be available to other computers on your network then choose bridged mode.) 

6. Start the server. 

7. In the virtual server environment do the following: 

a. Disable the firewall 
b. Reboot 
c. Go to command prompt and type ipconfig to obtain the ip address of the virtual server 

8. In the newly installed windows on your computer (aka the real windows) open a command prompt and ping the ip address of the server. If it can be pinged then everything is working as it should. 

9. Type the following: 

slmgr -skms [ip address of server] 

10. After confirmation type the following: 

slmgr -ato 

11. Confirmation of activation should follow. Use slmgr -dlv to verify if you would like. 

12. In 6 months run the server and start at step 7c to renew your activation"

If so running a Vmware KMS server and then shutting it down might cause the next update to imple that it is looking at a different KMS?

Also eventually if this is so an the vmware method sitll works, those using the chinese servers might watchout due to the potential of those getting killed and having to re-format just to use a different kms.

I decided I'd try to just upgrade my RC1 business version of vista to the EcHoS Vista Enterprise version.  Note that I had NOT entered a key when I first installed the Vista Business RC1 version.  No prompt to input key for EcHoS enterprise upgrade, so I NEVER entered a key in ANY installation.

anyway, upgrade succeeded, and i used gluu's new instructions -- they worked perfectly.  im pumped -- thanks motorlan for the great upload, thanks gluu for the great instructions, and thanks for osx86project.org for great tutorials on mac osx on regular PC's.  you guys all do amazing work...

,Ben-dover4287,2006-12-14T03:20Z,"**REAL** Directions How To Crack Vista..


Before U Install A FRESH Vista

1.Unplug your PC?s Internet connection.

2.Turn on your PC (or restart if it?s already on) and boot into your BIOS (usually hitting the  key before initialization; otherwise refer to your instruction manual).

3.Set the date to December 31, 2099 (December to prevent accidents from happening when setting the year back to 2099 for any reason; as Vista keeps the most amount of days you passed the time you installed it, so if you pass the 30 days after you install it and boot up Vista, it will remember that every time you reboot and not allow you to log on).


4.Save & exit the BIOS and install Vista, leaving the product key textbox blank and un-checking the ?Automatically activate Windows when I?m online? checkbox. (You can either burn the ISO file to a DVD using software like DVD Decrypter or mounting it to a virtual drive with DAEMON Tools 

5.When Windows shows the time settings when you?re setting it up, do not change anything (not even the time zone), just click ?Next? and finish. Now Windows will test your system performance.

6.After it finishes, log on. Click on the time on your taskbar, click the ?Change date and time settings?? link, go to the ?Internet Time? tab, hit the ?Change Settings? button, and uncheck the ?Synchronize with an Internet time server? checkbox. Then set your date back to today. Also, you can set the time zone to your own. 

7.Plug in your PC?s Internet connection and download updates as necessary

8.Now the 30-day trial period will last until year 2099. You will not be able to activate Windows, but WGA still works and you can download anything from Microsoft just like a legitimate copy of Windows can. This trick goes the same for Windows XP. The activation status in System Information (Control Panel à System) will say 30 days."

,lotacus,2007-02-06T04:17Z,heh. They were smart enough to have the website as an entire image so it won't be indexed by search engines. Very clever.
,blaze7,2007-02-07T08:54Z,"Don't use a key for Ultimate, use time activation 2099 crack or other. There are instructions with the cracks, I'm not posting them here as you must not enter name, password and key when installing and it will confuse people using this torrent."

 it Works.. i almost read all the comments!!!"
,o2o2,2007-07-06T04:29Z,"Just tried it.  vbs.net.cn is working just fine.  Simple instructions below

Step 01:
Install Vista FINAL RELEASE with Key YFKBB-PQJJV-G996G-VWGXY-2V3X8
Choose ""Business edition"" ONLY not others !!

Step 02:
When Windows setup completed and Internet access setup completed. Open Command Prompt under ""Administrator Mode"", that is, right click the Command Prompt icon, select ""run as admin""

Now in command prompt (Admin mode) type:

cscript c:\windows\system32\slmgr.vbs -skms vbs.net.cn 

cscript C:\windows\system32\slmgr.vbs -ato

DONE:
Activate completed !!"
,atnt,2007-11-08T11:29Z,"why doesn't everyone just get an RTM dvd image, a list of keys and the bios mod driver spoof for oem activation. It worked for me (vista ultimate) on an Asus desktop and HP DV9000 laptop perfectly. "
,byb3,2009-02-01T18:10Z,"Well I spent a good few days racking my mind as to why this wasn't working for me.  Whatever I kept doing, the VMWare server kept syncing to my local time.  Here is how you workaround it:

1. Disable the Windows Time service in services.msc on your host computer.

2. Edit the VMX and place these lines at the top of the file:

time.synchronize.tools.startup = ""FALSE"" 
tools.syncTime = ""FALSE""
rtc.startTime = ""1164286430""
time.synchronize.continue = ""FALSE""
time.synchronize.restore = ""FALSE""
time.synchronize.resume.disk = ""FALSE""
time.synchronize.resume.memory = ""FALSE""
time.synchronize.shrink = ""FALSE"" 

Notice that the first line isn't included in most peoples advice.  I think it is due to me using a newer version of VMWare.  Delete the second occurence of syncTime or it will complain, I think it was around line 41.

3.  Change the network to Host mode. Boot the server up in VMWare.  Goto cmd and type:
slmgr -dlv

If the current count is 41 then you're good to go.

4. Use the normal way of activating (set server, then -ato).

This should work for all of the other images flying around the net as well.  I think it comes down to the W32Time service as well as that extra line in the VMX.

Good Luck."
,xerox20001,2011-05-10T14:00Z,will it work for office 2010?
