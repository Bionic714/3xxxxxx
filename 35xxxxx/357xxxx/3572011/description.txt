unlike windows xp and volume activation 1.0 windows vista doesnt have any corporate
keys which will permanently activate it. volume activation 2.0 requires a corporate
user to either do a one time activation through microsoft servers (mak) or companies
can host a local activation server which does not talk to microsoft (kms). the only
difference is kms requires re-activation once every 180 days. however as long as
theres a local kms server its simple to keep windows activated.  this release is a
vmware image of a permanently activated kms server which allows local activation of
windows vista business/enterprise edition. volume activation 2.0 is only built into
those two editions.
 
install vista business/enterprise edition with the key xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.
 
using the latest vmware workstation, boot the image. disable vmware firewall.
 
on the non vm vista right click the command prompt icon and run as admin. type ...
 
cscript c:\\windows\\system32\\slmgr.vbs -skms vm_vista_ip
 
cscript c:\\windows\\system32\\slmgr.vbs -ato
 
windows should now be activated.
 
to check activation status type ...
 
cscript c:\\windows\\system32\\slmgr.vbs -dlv
 
tested using echos windows vista enterprise and vmware workstation 5.5.3 but seems to
have issues with the billgates windows vista business.
