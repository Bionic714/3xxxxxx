,asp4dos,2007-03-25T18:17Z,"this torrent is monitored periodically, however its source may be located in a backup, or on a remote computer; if there are not enough peers to ensure 100% health, you may request seeding on this page. Feel free to use the Romanian language :-)"

,ava__,2009-01-31T12:30Z,"please someone seed ... 

also looking for 'Basorelief' from the same artist - anyone ?"
,asp4dos,2009-04-06T17:58Z,"sorry. had some big problems with my PC. will seed now.

i gotta check my discs, but i think i also have ""Basorelief"".

PS. oricine e roman sa scrie in romana aici. ne complicam toti degeaba cu romgleza asta."
