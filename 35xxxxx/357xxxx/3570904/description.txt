Brief:

Adrian Enescu is a Romanian composer who pioneered the electronic music genre in the late 70's in his home country. The music is a mixture of disco, blues and other genres played with a combination of conventional instruments and synthesized sounds.

The tracks are ripped from vinyl; although I took every possible measure to ensure high quality, there is a sort of saturation effect in the high frequency range; the tracks are remastered in 48 kHz Stereo, with the highest quality custom WinLAME VBR settings, so you can have archival grade content and attempt further improving the sound quality if you wish.

Update:

I've ripped the second side of the first album again, with a new soundcard. all sound quality issues solved.

Motto:

"I know you're out there. I can feel you know. I know that you're afraid, you're afraid of us, you're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't came here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin.

I'm going to hang up this phone and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you, a world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries, a world, where anything is possible. Where we go from there, this is a choice I leave to you."
