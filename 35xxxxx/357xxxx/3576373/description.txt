  A look at the annual journey of Emperor penguins  as they march -- single file -- to their traditional breeding ground.  

Dutch:           
  March Of The Penguins vertelt het verhaal van de avontuurlijke tocht  die duizenden keizerpinguins elk jaar aanvatten om te kunnen paren. Een verhaal over liefde, moed en avontuur in de meest onherbergzame streek ter wereld: Antarctica. 

A little later then the most of you expected, but no-one else picked this fine documentary up. So that's why we decided to still do this one now. For all you nature-lovers who definitely wanted to see it. We promise you won't regret downloading this release from SuPReME.                  
                                
Don't forget, making custom subtitled discs is a lot of work.  
So remember that when you comment on the releases.                                                                  

Our advice is: just burn the .img files directly to your DVD-/+R! Don't extract, as this will damage the dvd structure we've created. If you do extract, make sure you burn all the folders.                            
                                
GreetZ to everyone we love...                                                                              
                                                                                                                                            
Lots of respect to EMERALD and all other DVDR rls groups...                                            
...without them there would be no custom sub scene!
