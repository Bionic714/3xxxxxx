The quality of playbacks is great, but i've got 2 problems: cdg files don't play in Winamp, though i've installed the plugin, and Bryan Adams is 'jumping' while playing :( The same thing is with Bassline 07 - Whitney Houston -Saving all my love for you and George Michael - Careless whisper :( 
What could be the reason? thx in advance for reply! :)"
