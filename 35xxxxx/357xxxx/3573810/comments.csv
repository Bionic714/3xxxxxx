,cfryz,2009-12-31T23:19Z,"omg i can't believe i uploaded this in a .rar.....
the NFO file is just a text document that has extra information about the music..not really important. usually has some kind of ascii art and shows what release group ripped the cd.
on mac osx you can open it with text edit, and on windows i think you have to get another program like damn NFO"
