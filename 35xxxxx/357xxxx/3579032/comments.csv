,zoner81,2006-12-18T21:14Z,I have never seen the point in dubbing movies. Hollywood should really not allow to dub movies. If they want to watch the movies learn the f*cking language!!

,Dreachnar,2006-12-20T09:49Z,"Na also.....ich hab den Flick gesehen, und er wahr gar nicht so schlecht.

Obwohl ich nicht kein Deutscher bin, stĂśrt die Sprache mir nicht.

Al die andern mĂźsen warten bis er auch in einer andere Sprache  nieder zu laden ist. "
