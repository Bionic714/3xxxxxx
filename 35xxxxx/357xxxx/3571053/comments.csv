,jeradzan12,2006-12-15T03:05Z,"I mounted the no cd disk image, but I still get the ""Disc1 not inserted"" error.  When I checked the no cd disk image, there is only the read me rtf file and an empty base folder.  Am I doing something wrong?"
,argostrong,2006-12-24T00:11Z,do you mean the unix application X-CD-Roast to mount the NoCD img?  or did you mean Toast?

,Dhaynswo,2007-01-13T21:41Z,"Is this the whole Academy bundle a dud because the no-CD hack won't work?  If there is a way to play without it that would be great but right now I cant get the toasted disc 1 or No-CD to run the game without it saying ""disc 1 not inserted"".... great game though hope to be playing it soon"

,mattosan,2007-04-09T18:21Z,'I never Existed' I did as you said but still get insert disk 1 message. Anybody got any ideas? Really wanna play. Did you change the file type on the no CD file from .sitx to .zip or .toast?
,da big b,2007-04-19T23:26Z,"Hi everyone,
like a lot of people i had some problems with the disc 1 error but i've got this thing (kinda) SOLVED

1. INSTALL the game with the disc1.toast and disc2.toast

2. From the updates file (this torrent) DO NOT install ANY patches.

3. make sure your version of TOAST is at least 7.1 , I had version 7.0 and it wouldnt work so this step is crucial.

4. mount the no cd.toast and start playing.

The only problem is that the patches included here fix some bugs in levels where it rains acid inside of the buildings. When you install these patches though, the no cd.toast will have no more effect. just have to wait and see, i haven't reached the level yet.

,Commiesan,2008-01-17T18:15Z,"Hi!

I'll post this on all three toorents, so hopefully someone will notice it! ;)

I Cannot get the game to work either. I Downloaded ""1/2"" & ""2/2"" and installed the game. I tried to start a new game. The game opend and i Could create a player, but then it told me to insert cd1. I tried with the ""1/2"" .dmg, but that did not help. Then i Downloaded the ""(MAC) Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy updates, extra maps, no-cd key,"", Patched the game, and extracted the Nocd.toast.sitx and clicked on the Nocd.toast.  The cd-image appeared in Devices, but now i could not even open the game, it asks for cd1 immideatly. When people say i shall burn it to a cd, do they mean i shall burn the ""1/2.dmg"" or the ""Nocd.toast""?

Plz help! //Commiesan"
,sage001,2008-01-22T00:21Z,"hey im really a noob, would u guys describe wat u mean by mount?

,jximagineit,2008-01-26T19:50Z,"I have followed the instructions given by ""da big d"" to the letter. Except I have toast8 not 7.1, however I follow all the other instructions and still get the ""no disk 1 inserted in drive"" I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, or if it is becuase of my version of toast. anythoughts?

,Cubric,2008-02-10T16:54Z,Make sure you Unmount Disc One before mounting the No-CD patch. Hope that helps.:)
,Scarface1986,2008-02-28T14:53Z,"i found this and i have the same problem...

""Icarus (1/15/2008 - version 1.0.1e)
Didn't do jack! Jedi Academy ran fine on my old iBook with OS 10.3.9, but when I try to run it on my new MacBook with 10.5.1, it starts a weird humming noise but doesn't run the program or change the screen or anything. Installing this patch -- twice -- did absolutely nothing.""


Does anyone have any idea to this??

thx"

Mount Image

Install game....

Eject the mounted images

This has the NO_CD and updates. Install the updates-1.0.1b and 1.0.1c, then make a copy TO A REAL CD the NO_CD (I used toast, but you can use disk utility)

Verify then mount...

Enjoy...

It worked online!!! "
,thesamenio,2008-03-31T01:16Z,"doest work for me! 
So here is the deal... i CAN run the game by installing from both cd's and then mounting no cd with TOAS and the game works and everything, BUT it crashes after first lever is beaten. NOW i figure that update would fix the deal, but after i update the game b and c update i cant make no cd to work... ANY Suggestions? "
,godemiche,2008-07-25T13:21Z,"Greetings everyone, it works for me! i use Leopard and Toast 8 and the way i do this is installing the 2 CDs on the Applications folder. Then i right click the file ""No CD.Toast.sitx"" and select ""Open with"" and then i select ""Toast"". When Toast is open i select ""mount"". When i see the CD mounted in the system you can now play the game and it doesn't show you the No CD message anymore. Good Game! Have Fun!"
,motherofbermuda,2008-07-27T01:16Z,"On the first scene before the big gate after beating the lizards, the game crashes to the desktop.

,dabradster,2008-08-23T20:03Z,"Anyone who said this works on intel is bullshitting. I get a wierd sound when I click on it.

,jmnikricket,2008-09-09T23:25Z,"For those who need a step-by-step guide to use the no cd file and don't have Toast, here it is:

1) Download torrent file
2) Use torrent client to download ""JKJA Extras.sitx"" file
3) Double click the file; it should automatically unarchive (.sitx is a type of compression similar to .zip) with Stuffit Expander or similar decompressing software. If not, right-click the file and select ""Open with..."" and select ""Stuffit Expander"". If it is not an option, select ""Other"" and find the StuffIt Expander application (usually in /Applications or /Applications/Utilities). If you don't have StuffIt Expander, it is available as a free download; do a search.
4) The unarchived folder ""JKJA Extras"" should be in the same directory (folder) as the original downloaded file. Find the file ""Jedi Academy - No CD.toast.sitx"" and double-click to unarchive or use steps from (3).
5) Now you should see the file ""Jedi Academy - No CD.toast"" in your ""JKJA Extras"" folder. Copy this file to your desktop for more convenient burning if you'd like.
6) Insert a blank CD-R. You might get a prompt asking what you want to do with the CD. Just choose ""Open Finder"" if you do.
7) Open the application ""Disk Utility"" in your /Applications/Utilities/ directory.
8) Click the ""Burn"" icon at the top toolbar in the Disk Utility application.
9) Select the ""Jedi Academy - No CD.toast"" file from your Desktop (if you didn't move the file to your desktop you will have to navigate through your download files; mine was at /Documents/Azureus Downloads/JKJA Extras/JediAcademy - No CD.toast)
10) An options screen pops up. The defaults should be good. Click ""Burn"" and wait for it to verify and finish burning.
11) Insert the CD whenever you want to play the game.

This is how I did it using Leopard on an Intel mac. Hope this helps you guys out. Note that you must burn the CD; simply mounting the .toast file by double-clicking it will not be recognized by the game."

,ssbdk,2010-09-01T21:09Z,"so basically - i did all the instructions as from the last comment. I am not a noob. i've done cracks etc 100 of times.. but this one won't work.. first of all:
the crack provided - doestn work.. say app had to quit unexpected. i fixed that by copying & replacing the iPatcher file in : ""Jedi Academy MP v9467 NoCD Patch""  (show package) /contents/MacOs/  
with the iPatcher file from the iPatch program (show package) /Contents/Reseources/iPatcher (Show package again)/Contents/MacOs  and voila..

now the crack.app works (same for MP)
now... i apply the crack on the patched (b through e) JA file. and the crack asks me this: ""iPatch need to change permissions for these files : MacOS
Jedi Academy""

I agree to change permissions and...  i get this: ""Error   /Applications/Jedi Academy/Jedi Academy.app/Contents/MacOS
/Applications/Jedi Academy/Jedi Academy.app/Contents/MacOS/Jedi Academy ""


HELP PLEASE!? :3"
