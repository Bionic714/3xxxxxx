,sparr4761,2006-12-20T17:05Z,"Kan du hjälpa mig?

Jag behöver veta hur jag får med subtitlarna, framförallt svenskan. Det här kan jag: Laddar ner filerna, öppnar Nero smart, väljer DVD, väljer alla filer, trycker nästa, nästa och nästa. Bränner skivan. Problemet är när jag tittar på den vanliga DVD-spelaren så kommer menyerna upp för att välja film men det går inte att trycka på någonting, spolar framåt och där utan någon text. Textmenyn visar sig inte alls. Hur gör jag?"
