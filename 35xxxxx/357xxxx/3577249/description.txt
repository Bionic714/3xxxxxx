
Her introduction to the 4AD label came in 1991, when she featured on
This Mortal Coil?s third album, Blood, singing a Rodney Crowell song,
?Til I Gain Control. She then went on to release 3 solo albums under
the 4AD banner: Love (1991), Heidi Berry (1993), and Miracle (1996).
A fourth 4AD album, the retrospective Pomegranate ? An Anthology was
released in 2001. As a 4AD artist, Heidi toured extensively in the UK,
Europe and the USA. Her songs have appeared on episodes of Dawson?s
Creek and Baywatch. She has also composed soundtracks for two BBC
television documentaries.

Last year, Heidi sent herself ?back to school? and enrolled on the
songwriting course run by Ray Davies at The Arvon Foundation. She found
this experience, ?renewing, inspiring and the hardest work I?ve ever
done?. The result is, Heidi is currently recording a collection of new
songs. She says, ?I?ve got about 40 songs now. How and when they will
be released, I haven?t the faintest idea. I just know I need to do this
with all my heart.?

Heidi Berry teaches Songwriting and Live Performance at the Brighton
Institute of Modern Music. She lives on the south coast of England with
her partner and a cranky black cat.
