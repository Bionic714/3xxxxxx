,Chimairo,2006-12-09T13:31Z,Somethning strange about this prog..atleast it acts strange on my system.. It dosent want to start up. So i have to do.... START - RUN - then type NERO ok...in order to get it to start. ..really wierd.
,Chimairo,2006-12-09T13:33Z,"oh ive re-installed it 2 times.. 
it works the first time after installation..
then the trouble starts."
,Chimairo,2006-12-10T04:14Z,Now.. its like this this is crap.. i just got a non-licence message from nero. I guess i have find a release group capable of cracking it right!.
,albanen,2006-12-13T22:25Z,"Same as you chimairo,installed it twice,it works the first time after installation..

Guess the crack is no good for online updates:("
