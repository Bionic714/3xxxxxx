Blasterboy. 
I´m still having connecting problems, it won´t be solved soon so I hope someone  else can help you with S03E12."
,i2mfan,2006-12-17T13:33Z,"Thank you again for the kind words and Happy Holidays to everyone(being PC here).

S03 is not missing any seconds at the start of each episodes.  

S03E12 had 2 .torrent. You must have the latest because I deleted the first one by error. The connection error might due to that. I think I had 20 seeders on the first one. It's the same files. Just download the .torrent again.

Don't have a next project right now(Maybe ""Day Break"" web episodes if I can get them and it's not already seeded) . For now, I will build my ratio on private trackers  :D.  I will keep an eye on my torrents and help out when there is too few seeders. It's ""Surgical seeding""."
,i2mfan,2007-01-01T16:56Z,"Happy new year!
I just seen that MIS Info Video v2.3.0 is now Free(donation). I don't regret buying it and nows your chance to use it for free. I'm sure you will like it. The Resume a video is a great feature(just like on my PVR). MIV with Info2MIS makes a great combo to view movies also with the help of the .MIS.

P.S. I will copy this comment on a few of my torrents :D"
,troytempest,2007-06-02T21:34Z,"Hi
any chance of seeding S03E20 Beneath The Black Sky as am stuck on 78% with a few others that keep checking in and out. I have uploaded over 800 megs to various people but nobody has the complete episode

Thanks"
,Go_Cat75,2007-09-27T14:33Z,"This was my favorite series and was only ever screened on TV once here.  Well done for seeding. I?m trying to download the complete series.  There are a lack of seeders and I am having problems on - Episodes S1 -5,8,10,11,12,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21.  S2 - 1,2,3,5,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,17 & S3 - 14,16,17,18.  10 Episodes of which are over 90% complete.  I am so happy to watch the episodes I missed that I will continue seeding all episodes for min 3 months.  Guys please do not auto stop if less than 1 seed."
,Go_Cat75,2007-10-07T12:52Z,I sourced the remaining episodes elsewhere due to lack of seeders...  Send me a PM if you get stuck..
