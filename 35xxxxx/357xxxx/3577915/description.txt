******************************************************
I will like to thank all those who help seed this series.
I could not do it without you. :D. It's possible to do it
with a low upload speed (25kB/S) and the help of the 
community.

I also hope you enjoy the extra details that I added like
the .MIS, Folder.jpg .... It was my own way to show you 
what a .MIS can do for tv series or movies. My feedback
help the creator of the .MIS to make Info 2 MIS simpler
to use. I just did not tell him what I did with it. ;)
I just want you to make a .MIS with your own uploads from 
now on. ;) Plus, the fact the tools(I2M,MIV) are free, 
you don't have any excuses unless your  not using Win XP :D 
If you don't like MIV, ask the author of your media player 
to support it. The more options, the better!

3 things: 
 1- First Wave was different because the description 
    was not like other series on TV.COM.
 2- I don't use the .TXT unless I upload a file on the Web. 
 3- Rename .TXT to .NFO if you want

For my own curiosity, can you contact me on TPB via PM 
or the last torrent(S03E22) if you began to use the .MIS. 

You can also give your feedback to M.I.S. and that's good 
for any software. Authors need your feedback to make
better software. They don't know what is not working 
unless someone tell them ;)

Thanks again to the current/future seeders.

See you on the web!

DVD version: DVD does not exist yet
HD version: Yesssss when?

Last change to the rest of text: 2006-12-14

Check the date above, if not changed, don't read 
the rest because it was not changed since the last time.

Please, seed 1:1 or max. 72hrs because I can't do that 
alone. Someone else let you have the file, so just give
back.

You can upload the .TORRENT on other publics/privates tracker
More trackers = more seeders/leechers = more speed overall :D
I don't know all of them ;) But keep all the files and 
use the .TXT for description.

If your are stuck because no one is seeding, just 
leave a comment in the last episode that was uploaded.
Me or someone else will help you finish it. But go to 
the original tracker.

Thanks

Contest rules + video(how to) here: 
http://www.i2mfan.com/contest.htm

P.S. I'm no longer associated with the site(my choice).
But I don't have to pay the bills now. 

I started seeding episode 15 before I knew of it. :(

******************************************************
Some asked me to include a "How to create a .MIS from 
tv.com". So, I created a small video(1m30s) with 
notes, chapters... I rared it because it took 331KB 
vs 8.06MB. It's on i2mfan.com site also. I submited it.

******************************************************
If you download a free file anywhere(database/software)
remember to click on the ads. They do appreciated it. 
It pays for the bandwidth/site! :D

******************************************************
So, what is a .MIS(my own definition)? 

A .MIS is a metadata text file(title, description, 
credit, goofs, chapters...) file formatted to help 
in the organization of all the movies/tv shows/podcast ...
you got in folders. It replace the .NFO.

It's formated so that players (software and consumer 
electronics) can use that information(metadata) and
display it on the screen.

The .TXT was made from the .MIS text file as the source. 
I only created it to post on sites. Otherwise, I don't 
use it.

******************************************************

INFO 2 MIS v2.0.0B7 is free. It's the app's that I 
used to create the .MIS. It can also extract
information from imdb.com(with picture), tv.com, 
amazon.com(with picture), dvdempire.com (with picture) ....

Took me a second with an episode on tv.com and
a few more for a movies on imdb.com

******************************************************
VideoRedo(not free) is the best for editing MPEG files.
It's fast and easy and worth the money. I can remove
commercials or cut an MPG2 with ease. :D
