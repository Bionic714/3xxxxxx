It's easier to obtain an included Service Pack 1 from

So, it would be a good idea to remove VS7.0sp1-KB837234-X86.exe from this torrent.

Best wishes!"

,Fro1337,2012-05-02T11:41Z,"The Windows Component Update CD appears to be missing from this torrent. When I try to install, I am told:

""Setup has detected that some of the Windows components that are installed on your computer do not match the versions required for Visual Studio .NET. You must install a different version of these Windows components.""

I think it should be possible to simply download the necessary components (prerequisites) from Microsoft's website...but only if I knew what they were. Does anyone know?"
