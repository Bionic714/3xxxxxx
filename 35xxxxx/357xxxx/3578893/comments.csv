,Emplehod,2010-11-09T03:05Z,"@Luxverus

My pick would be ConvertXtoDVD. Burn at slowest rate possible.  I have not found a DVD player that won't play the discs."
,Emplehod,2010-11-09T03:08Z,"Just a note on VLC Player.  The reason it works so well is you don't need codecs installed in Windows because it uses its own.

I use MediaPortal because it's a great way to control all your media and it's free.  You can also have it upscale videos to 1080 so they look better."
