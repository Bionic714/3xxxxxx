Ready to wage war and take on any enemy, Gillie Da Kid is back on his mixtape grind, setting you up with this mixtape from Superstar Jay. 
The third mixtape from GDK in his line of King of Philly is another appetizer, as Gillie like to call them.

With a taste of some of his finer unreleased material since his years at Cash Money Records as well as 6 new and exclusive records that are
premiering on this mixtape, The Truth Hurts is just part of the plan. With a total of 20 tracks and freestyles from Gillie Da Kid, this 
mixtape features his Major Figga family (Bump J, Ab Liva, Dutch & Spade) plus a special appearance from 50 Cent.
