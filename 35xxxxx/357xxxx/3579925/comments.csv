,Acronim,2009-01-26T19:27Z,"I'm trying to track down the models that are on the list of not included models...
I already modified the list (and didn't save the original one :p), though, so if anyone is interested in the other models, please write a comment with all the numbers of the models on that list, so I can try to put it together...
(Just the numbers is enough)"
