The 0701-0800 pack is on the way; about 30
more roms need to be released to fill it up.

,enjoy1974,2006-12-20T08:28Z,someone help me with Cartoon Network racing for nintendo ds??
,rowdy,2006-12-21T12:48Z,is it possible to play these with the max media dock + 1gb cf?
[T],magumagu,2006-12-21T15:31Z,"@enjoy1974
You have to be a bit more specific. A mere ""help me"" doesn't give to much of a hint 'bout your problem.

@rowdy
As these are clean dumps will they - with the correct preparation/patching etc. - play on any flash-card/devkit solution.

@both of you

,enjoy1974,2006-12-24T09:43Z,"thanks for answar magumagu.

My kid want to play Cartoon Network racing. Someone who can upload this game for me, so I can download. Thank you"
,Spearmint,2006-12-26T16:48Z,Am i the only one who cant save the game after playing it?
,rowdy,2006-12-27T09:14Z,"I managed to play most of these games using Max Media Dock and the app called ""Maximum Overload"" (with patching).  Thanks for the torrent!"
,Freelancer,2006-12-27T20:34Z,Thanks for this (and the previous ones)! Any ETA on the next pack? Can't you upload half a pack (701-755)? :D 
[T],magumagu,2006-12-28T01:12Z,"@Freelancer
The next one is on 785 out of 800; and no, i won't release the next 'till it's complete. Kinda ruins the point of having a complete and verified pack. People would seed that and then not bother to seed the next one properly. The next one will probably arrive in a week or so - depends on the scene."
