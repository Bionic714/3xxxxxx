,en_scp,2006-12-10T19:20Z,Grande som :) keep posting! ;)
,affekopp,2006-12-12T08:18Z,"Hm, this torrent shows seeds but since yesterday I'm stuck at 90,8 % and all others have an average of 85 % (not increasing either). Anyone knows what's wrong here?"
,Miguel28,2006-12-12T23:12Z,Been out for a days... let's finish it!
,affekopp,2006-12-13T13:34Z,"Sorry but now I'm stuck at 99,8 % for hours. Anyone who made it?"
,en_scp,2006-12-13T19:55Z,It's a pity that this file has been downloaded 486 times and there are only 9 seeders left.... this in a torrent posted only 3 days ago! Please learn to share a bit more... And to miguel28: thanks for the patience and keep up the good work ;)
,Miguel28,2006-12-13T21:15Z,"Is anybody receiving data from me? I'm seeding and seeding and everybody keeps stuck at 99.6%... give me some feedback, so i can find out what's going on"
,affekopp,2006-12-13T22:42Z,"I had it open the entire day and still stuck at 99,6 %. Receiving no data at all. Bittornado showed 0 seeders but 1,998 distributed copies the whole day. Meanwhile I tried to open it with Azureus but still got stuck. The missing 0,004 % seem to be on CD 8. I wonder if it would make sense to re-create the torrent. In other cases this made it possible to conclude the downloads. But I'm not sure if this works in every case. I'm even not sure why so many seem to be stuck, as the tracker shows 12 seeds right now. I have no idea why so many people can't connect to them. Please somebody do something. I got to have this file. I listened to some of the material yet and it's a dream come true for every Elvis fan."
,guffboy321,2006-12-13T23:02Z,"Yup, I'm on 99.6% too, have been for several days. Missing data from CD3, tracks 17 to 20 inclusive."
,Professor Moriarty,2006-12-14T02:56Z,"I have the following partial download data for CD8 :

T17 is at 75% complete
T18 is not downloading at all
T19 is at 33% complete
T20 is at 66% complete

I have been stuck also at 99.6% for over a day. Maybe you could just add a new torrent for cd8 only or just the missing tracks, without messing with this original torrent ? Either way, I really want to thank Miguel28 for uploading all this great sounding Elvis material in the first place."
,Miguel28,2006-12-14T10:46Z,"I did some research and it seems to be a bug with Utorrent. I didn't find it yet a solution, but in the meanwhile, i uploaded a new torrent with the missing tracks of CD8 - http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3576491. I'm sorry for this, it's the first time happening to me."
,Miguel28,2006-12-14T10:59Z,"Meanwhile, i have another one i think you'll like, http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3576493."
,affekopp,2006-12-14T16:14Z,I still don't know where the tracker gets the permanently changing seeder numbers from.
,Miguel28,2006-12-14T21:01Z,"Those seeders are fake, ot it's a bug or a ficticious users, but they don't get any data from me"
,Miguel28,2006-12-14T21:08Z,"To anyone who wants this torrent: it will only go to 99.6%, the rest of the missing tracks is in another torrent, i posted the link above. To all the others who have reached the max %, please keep seeding to others; i'm removing my seed to post other Elvis stuff. Thanks"
