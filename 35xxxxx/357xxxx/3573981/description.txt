Sorry, I had to delete a previous upload of this set, because it was incomplete. This one is 100% right.


"Fresh from his Comeback Special this is Elvis Presley at his peak. A new producer, strong material and one of the best session bands in the country reinvigorated the King. This is unarguably his most consistent post-army work. Outtakes and session recordings have appeared on many bootlegs before - most notably Finding The Way Home - but these have always been somewhat randomly selected and sequenced. For the first time, Purple Chick has gathered together every available piece and compiled a chronological 10CD set. Some of these versions have never appeared on CD before - others will be very familiar."
