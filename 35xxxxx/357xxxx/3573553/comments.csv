,EssexRedDevil,2006-12-09T13:42Z,Sorry guys but ive never downloaded a game before is it simple to play once its downloaded how do iset it up? where do i get the tools to do it etc?
,desreveR,2006-12-09T14:03Z,"EssexRedDevil: First and foremost, download it, then read and follow the instructions in the description (numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
The tools you need is a program that can unpack .rar files (I use Winrar), and a virtual drive program, e g Daemon Tools.
Don't ask where to find them, just use Google..."
,mixorr,2006-12-09T17:09Z,Anybody tested yet if it works?
,desreveR,2006-12-09T17:41Z,"mixorr: I've played it for a few weeks, and uploaded it here when Silentscapes tracker went down. I have included the patches and scans of the booklet, but the .iso is exactly what their original torrent contained."

,vitorvious,2007-04-05T14:23Z,"never played this before,  will my system run it?

XP builders edition SP2
733 MHZ intel
320 MB RAM
Nvidia Geforce FX 5200 128 RAM

never heard of this game b4 so idk if i should run it or not. I run games like counterstrike, gta san andreas, tactical ops. So i figure i could run this?"
,KH2205,2007-04-06T17:43Z,"for b0a and piccolo0:

The solution is simple. You just enter an internet site where they sell games, you make an account and order this cheap soon-to-be-ten-years-old game.
Install, play, and enjoy.
No but seriously: try re-installing! My diablo didn't work if i installed as ""complete"". I had to install it as minimum so that it would work. No guarantee but it could help. Also try changing the graphics quality.

vitorvious: yes, if your pc runs san andreas without any problems then it proboably runs silent hill 1 perfectly.

,plainlake,2007-06-26T03:01Z,"Ok, so I downloaded the .rar and extracted the .ISO file and the patches. Then I tried to use daemon on the iso file. got an error. Then I found out that I needed the ePSXe - emulator... got that. then I needed to download BIOS and plugin for it to function.. then finally I could use the emulator on the ISO file and now I am able to watch a black screen as long as I want, realy scary... Yeah I just got a black screen from the emulator. 1,2,3,4,5,6 wont work because this is not a ISO file from a computer game right? I know I must have fucked up at some point, but could someone tell me where? I really want to play this game and I dont have a playstation.."
,deamon2000,2007-06-26T07:09Z,i guess there is no REAL silent hill 1 for pc since this is just epsxe with the iso of the game that one launch makes the exe give epsxe all the command lines to run but u still cant change the controls and when runing it IS JUST RUNING EPSXE and if u press escape the whole thing shuts down

Problem: How do I set up the controls to work on a keyboard? I looked at ePSP's faq, and it appears it can be done, but I'm havin trouble configuring it in the game....

Also, any way to skip the video intro after you hit ""Play""?  :-P"
,lordspamelot,2008-01-12T01:31Z,"For mounting and decompressing I use ALZip. It does the same as Daemon tools and WinRAR at one time. The only problem I have with it is that it can't create .rar archives on its own, it can only extract them. It can also extract about fifty other kinds of archives, though, so it's great for random types."

,Gogglor,2009-01-21T05:54Z,"I installed it, and it works fine. Few problems though.
First, in the first settings menu I increased all the video and audio settings to max (I have 2.0GB ram and an NVIDIA 6800 video card). Cinematic animation is still a bit dodgy, and I think there are really big pauses between the cop and main guy's dialogue.

Secondly, how do I get a gamepad to work? I tried following the instructions, but nothing's happening. I have a PS2-esque gamepad made by Dilong.

Thirdly, I hope it's just coincidental, but soon after I installed it my mouse started acting up. Now every second or so it stays in one spot for a bit before catching up to where it should be half a second later."

- It's not a PC version. As many others have pointed out throughout comments, it is a PS1/PSX game image packaged with a Playstation Emulator. Unfortunately, for epsxe to run properly, you do need a decent computer plus the knowledge to find/install the needed plugins for the emu to work as it's actually intended. Took me a good 3 hours of trial and error tests to see what worked best for visuals, cutscenes, general framerate.

Worth it though. It's nice to have a Playstation setup on the comp. snesorama gogo! XD"

,Rygads,2010-02-10T08:08Z,"Here is the real solution to installing this.

1. Unrar the initial download
2. Unrar Silent Hill PC v1.2.1 (DO NOT MOUNT ANY ISO IT WILL BREAK THE INSTALL)
3. Run the .exe and when you get to it, select Silent Hill PC from your initial .rar.
4. let install finish.

The reason it is unable to copy or rename the iso for the install is because, when mounted, the iso is in use by daemon and is rendered unmodifiable.   Follow my instructions and you'll be playing in no time."

Yes, the graphics are not great but the game still scare me until I s**t my pants lol and that's like 11 years past. I don't usually play games if it's like more then 5 or 6 years old, until I got surprised. Well, a classic is a classic and u cant say it to all old games, only a handful (RE1-2, Metal Gear, Zelda, Doom etc) that u can still enjoy playing it in 2011 or so on :)

,krilgeta,2011-04-05T20:05Z,"Amazing game thanx!! For those of you who still can't play i think this may help(This may only apply to people running vista).
1)unrar (download)
2)mount the .iso image from the unrar'ed directory
3)now autoplay will run.Click browse folder instead and right click auto run . select properties,compatibility run as admin and run xp service pack 2.apply. Now double click auto play and the installer should run
4)after installation.go to the downloaded unrar folder and extract the Silent Hill PC v1.2.1 patch and install Silent Hill PC v1.2.1
5)Now click Silent Hill shortcut and game should start.
6)If game still isn't working try messing with settings, changing res made my game crash so keep it default also the setting in the top right made my game crash, just see what works for you.
7)then click PLAY in the game

Hope this helps a few you!!!

My problem was same as every Vsta owner i.e. screen going black and game crashing with a message that goes something like ""Windows has encountered a problem"".

However, I have managed to make this game run on my PC.

What i did was I opened the settings file in the installed directory, where I found that the screen resolution was set at 1280x1024 which was way higher than my GPU could support.

So, I reduced it to 1024x768 and left the rest of the settings untouched. This time it worked for me. I am able to play the game now, however I have a minor problem of sound hiccoughing during FMVs and gameplay. If someone has a solution then please reply."

I played this game over 6 years ago or something, and it was probably the best game ever..
And now there is this awesome torrent, wich makes it able, to play the game on PC

I just have 1 problem..
I isntalled the game, patched, blablabla, settings are okay, and stuff like that, and as soon, as I start the game, it tells me following error message ePSX.exe is not working anymore ( the emulator ) 
When I go to the emulator, I search for the right configurations, there it also tells me, ""plugin working correctly...""

Please guys, I need help..I dont know what to do anymore !!!
Looking forward to your suggestions...
Chaos out "

,el_rafael,2012-01-04T20:47Z,"Ok guys, i will try give some help for those that had the problem with ""registering fonts""...

When this happen, thats ok, just close the window... then, open the task manager, go to processes, and finish the silenthill.exe or something like that, if you dont find one like this, thats fine..
You will see that was created the folder Silent Hill with some files, just will not working very well... so run the patch 1.2 (dont need install the other) and will happen again that problem of freeze the window at ""registering fonts"".. just close again the window.. and try to run the game from the folder... at least works with me :)

One problem that you might have, will be with the save states, wont work. What i've done: create a virtual machine with XP, install the game (dont happened any problem) and was created 1 more folder (sstates) and 3 more files irunin... so I copy these to the installation folder on my host and the save states start to working. Would be easier just play the game at virtual machine, if dont was more laggy.

Thats it, about the other problem of black screen, just configure the settings before start the game, like said by others."
