,gazza127,2006-12-06T22:42Z,is this in ENGLISH?
,Criten,2006-12-06T23:01Z,"Yes, the setup is in English. To run Office 2003 MUI Pack, you need the English version of any Office 2003 suite."
,pcstuff,2006-12-18T21:54Z,"This only works if you have Office 2003 with MUI support. This torrent is really no good, see microsoft's own website:

""The MUI Pack is not available as a stand-alone product. Instead, it is included in 2 English-language versions of Office 2003 Editions:

?Microsoft Office Professional Edition 2003 with MUI Pack.
?Microsoft Office Standard Edition 2003 with MUI Pack.""

So, to the original uploader: Please give us the whole Office Install!"
,aTanCS,2007-01-18T11:38Z,Please seed MS Office 2003 wit MUI Pack!
,grubbyone,2007-01-24T08:27Z,"Yes I agree. What is the point of seeding these packs if you can't use  them? Will they work with regular versions of 03 stand or 03 pro? Or is there a specific 0ffice 03 pro mui core disk? ANy help here? Much needed.
Thanks"
,don oddvar,2007-02-04T21:25Z,THANK YOU FOR UPLOADING!!!!!!
,bond_007,2007-11-09T03:32Z,"I can also confirm that this works on any Office 2003; I have tested.

Thx to the uploader."
,andysavi,2007-12-30T05:02Z,"Just to be shure. If I just want the Italian version, I need to DWN only DISK 1? Am I right?
Grazie in advance for any answer.
Ciao to all.
Andrea."
,Criten,2008-02-09T17:54Z,"andysavi: Yes, if you only want the Italian pack, then you need to download CD1 only."
,Affar2k,2008-03-10T14:47Z,"Thank you Criten, I was searching for this from a looooooooooooooooong time"

,violetaco,2008-09-07T10:21Z,"Well, I m having problems with the installation. I downloaded CD3 for spanish. I hit the MUISETUP and I got a promp up saying ""Please install microsoft Office 2003 and then run microsoft office 2003 multilinugal user interface pack setup again""

what is that?"
,_043,2008-11-10T11:11Z,"Thanks, I have successfully installed the mui over my office 2003. I have something to add though, you don't have to download even the whole disk. Each disk has a number of folders, each corresponding to a certain language. So basically you have to download only the folder with your language."

,ninja_script,2009-07-20T21:16Z,Does it includes French version ?
,vtmizvt,2009-10-27T12:18Z,"works great (croatian pack), thanks!"
,t7rex,2010-01-06T20:27Z,mange takk
,siggomar,2010-01-30T08:02Z,"Works perfectly for me.
When running MUISETUP.EXE in CD_, displays an error message.
When running SETUP.EXE in the language folder (1036 for french), it installs itself perfectly.
So, just download the 4 digits directory of the language you want to install; the rest is not needed.
Great!!!!!"
