Synopsis
It┬┤s Piglet┬┤s first movie -- and it┬┤s a BIG one! You┬┤ll delight in this wonderful story of friendship, fun and appreciation in which Pooh and all his pals learn it doesn┬┤t take somebody big to do big things. Piglet disappears into the 100 Acre Wood after hearing he is ┬┤┬┤just too small┬┤┬┤ to help with a hunny-gathering scheme. Pooh, Tigger, Eeyore and the others must then use Piglet┬┤s scrapbook of memories to find him. Soon, they realize just how big a part Piglet plays in their many adventures together!
