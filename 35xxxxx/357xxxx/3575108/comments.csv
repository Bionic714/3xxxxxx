to watch it in german use VLC player and choose 2nd audio track witch you find in the options menu.
or use MPC player and choose the 2nd audio track from the FILTERS menu."

,TurboTape13,2006-12-20T22:47Z,Hi! Can anyone help me get started on this? I've downloaded the first disk but I'm not sure what kind of program I need to watch it or how I can burn it on a DVD to make it watchable on my standalone DVD player. Please help anyone!!
,Nate4h20,2006-12-21T00:49Z,Hey TurboTape13 this is a HD DVD which can only be burned to either a Blue Ray or HD DVD (not to a non-HD 9 GB dvd).  Thus is why you see it is 15.22 GB !
,TurboTape13,2006-12-21T07:55Z,"Aah thanks Nate4h20! Didn't realize it was in HD-DVD format although I saw it was HD quality. But isn't there any software I can use to watch it on my PC? 

And why is it split up in 4,35 GB chunks if it's no point in burning it on a single layer DVD? Just for storage?

I guess I might have to wait until I buy a PS3 with Blue-Ray. Are u sure it's playable on a Blue-Ray player?

Thanks for all support!!!"
,siccoyote,2006-12-23T21:30Z,"It's not playable on a Blu-Ray or HD-DVD player, it is playable ona pc in normal PC DVD software. The chunks are as you said for storage. There are no standalone boxes to play this kind of material."
,sprellic13,2007-01-11T13:13Z,"To play this movie as smooth as possible on a PC you need PowerDvd 7 (it just playes HD movies better than other programs) and a pretty beefy machine. I guess you need at least a Geforce 6800 class or higher graphic card, and a 3 Ghz intel pentium class CPU. Also you must defragment your harddrive since it is supposed to read a lot of data from it while streaming this monster movie."
,sprellic13,2007-01-11T13:17Z,And you can of course burn it to 4 DVDs and just play from them like you opened a file on your HD. It works fine with PowerDvD at least. 
[T],FatFreddy475,2007-02-12T23:15Z,can someone please seed this.
,Beaverlicker,2007-04-24T02:20Z,These are ts files!NOT HDDVD!It is playable in almost every player!The HDDVD version will be released by the end of this year!
,pandanr9,2007-05-09T11:55Z,"Howcome I canÂ´t watch it in Powerdvd, ive got version. 7.3 with the latest patch, but i just got some strange colourpattern when i try to watch it. In VLCplayer I think the quality sucks when I watch it on my tv. Any suggestions?"
,Tobbator,2008-01-05T13:21Z,"For all you format freaks. Buy yourself a TVIX and dont ever think of CDs or DVDs or format compatible anymore. Just plug it in to your TV and watch DVD and HD quality movies that you download from PirateBay:
