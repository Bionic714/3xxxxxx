I am a big fan and missing a few, but I haven't seen a seed on here for a while. Could you please seed some more or have you blown your bandwidth??

Thanks"

,aodren14,2006-12-08T12:30Z,take care :integrated subtitles in french or in french for a few
,MrG_01,2006-12-09T03:54Z,"Anyone know how the quality of the movies are?  I have a few of these, but they're looking bad on an HD screen."
,svedy,2006-12-09T08:31Z,"No offense aodren14, I was just asking about the seeding, these are really big files.

Thanks again."
,zardoz7026,2006-12-23T05:52Z,I only downloaded Annie Hall.  Video excellent but sound is totally screwed up. Don't know about the other movies.
,der Kopf,2007-04-09T09:43Z,"HEADS UP!

I downloaded only 3 of these torrents, so what I say only has bearing on those:

Company Man = dubbed in French, no alternative (original English) audio track that I could find.

Celebrity = dubbed in French, no alternative (original English) audio track that I could find.

Anything Else = original (English) audio track, French subs hard-encoded into the movie file, so impossible not to view them.

DOWNLOADER BEWARE!"

crimes et dĂŠlits (sweet & lowdown)=english audio  and french subs"
,economy80,2008-06-13T18:50Z,"I downloaded another of his woody allen files and the picture quality is excellent overall.  be aware though that some have french hard subs, but others are french dubs."
