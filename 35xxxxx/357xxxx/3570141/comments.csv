,katabatic,2006-12-04T16:19Z,Why the hell did he put it all into 1 track?
,dammaged,2006-12-12T16:03Z,"it's not one track, the info is wrong - this is probably modified. comes in tracks, with a wrong .m3u and .nfo , also a .cue that's pretty useless.
includes med-res artwork.

mp3 quality is vbr, from what i can tell it's 160-320 kbit.

i would strongly suggest you buy this album if you like it, it's more than worth it, plus it shows support and respect to these amazing artists.
