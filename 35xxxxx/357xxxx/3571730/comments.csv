,torrentlover83,2008-09-06T17:41Z,"I'll be keeping this one seeding for a while.  Bill Hicks was a genius, plus, this torrent's been up for nearly two years, lets keep it going!"
,anoxia-dj,2008-11-09T15:06Z,"bill was an angel sent down to give us a look at life in black and white...
 but dont disrespect Leary, the rumours of bill being pissed at leary are of the mark and no cure for cancer is one of the all time great stand ups ever .. his timing and energy are genius ,, just a shame he chose to suck satans banger.."
,_God,2008-12-03T03:31Z,"The ""Relentless"" album is just ""Philosophy: The Best of Bill Hicks"" saved as ""Relentless"". So I've got two copies of ""Philosophy"" and no ""Relentless"". Anyone else?"
,teenagefreedomfighter,2009-01-16T02:48Z,Someone needs to turn the audio from Revelations into an album.
,S3nd41,2009-04-21T22:07Z,"Goddamn, now here was a guy that lived his whole life with his eyes wide open refusing to be fed bullshit by the system and using humor as a weapon to fight it and to get his message through. Bill was one of a kind and I'm glad I came across his work still on my teen years thanks to Tool's album AEnima."
