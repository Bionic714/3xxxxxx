As far as the sample video that I saw.. the quality is good but SEED people, I'm stuck at 71.5% (I have ports blocked and no way to solve this out.. the router isn't mine). I see only one peer with 100% but I don't get a byte from him."

Can't seem to get it all the way downloaded, I'm stuck at 673 MB.  So seed, pretty please."
