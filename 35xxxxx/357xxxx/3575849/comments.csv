but the full size is 4.18gigs? w00t?

and wtf is 4th edition?"
,Metal_Micke,2006-12-13T23:00Z,"its the fourth installment in the serries, and 4.18 gig sounds more believable than 2 gb when it comes to oblivion."
,Magnus900,2006-12-14T04:20Z,"This is Bethseda softwares 4th game. daggerfall1 elderscrolls2 morrowind3 Oblivion4, and ya this is the real deal my sys is not powerful enough to run the dam thing so i don't want it wasted.   hope u enjoy it,"
,Eirath,2006-12-17T01:29Z,"No Magnus, you got that all confused. It is not Bethesdas 4th game. They have made loads of other games. Neither are you right on the game names either.

The Elder Scrolls Games are, in succession:

Elder Scrolls Arena
Elder Scrolls 2: Daggerfall
Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind
Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion


Still question is: Why such a large file? Game is only half of that."

,cfx_star_fluent,2007-01-08T18:31Z,"the unpacked downloaded file will appears as an *.iso file in nero when selecting to burn image, however I believe the daemon tool can make a virtual disc, making the dvd unnecessary."
,axel_the_best,2007-01-10T13:32Z,you dont have to burn the game just download daemon tools and crack the game.

,Dreath,2007-03-04T21:34Z,I think to use it you use something called Daemon Tools. It tricks the computer into thinking that the iso is in the CD drive instead of on your hard drive. Check out their webiste (www.daemon-tools.ccfor an F.A.Q
,Slayerr18,2007-03-05T18:41Z,"Is this the English verson or is it the German version?

The reason i asked is because most oblivion torrents are the German version."
,Foxglove1971,2007-03-05T21:55Z,"English Version, and it does work.  burned straight to DVD using NTI DVD & CD Creator, then just installed it on my PC from the copied DVD.

search for the ISO-image file and mount it.
Then go to this virtual drive and install the game"

Of course it doesnt need a CD key, u left it out when u made the ISO!!!!! The exe file doesn't match up with the damn ISO information!"

,coxxen,2007-05-25T15:17Z,seed pls need this game today
,jacob3212,2007-05-29T16:03Z,"To those who may be confused of what to do when the game is done. Since i haven't finished downloading it yet, the first thing i'm going to do is use daemon tools on the iso.

Daemon tools is a emulation cd/dvd drive, which means it tries to act like a cd/dvd drive would by playing virtual cd's (when i say that i'm reffering to iso's) and this is something you can download off the internet just google it. 

The second thing i would do if this didn't work would be to use alcohol 120% which burns the iso directly to the cd acting like it is the real thing. And also if the game came with a crack (that's just a file that takes place of the game.exe to make a pirated game work) just copy and paste that into the game folder and replace to other game.exe. 

That's probably all you need to know to run this game. Oh yea and after your done if your not doing anything with the computer just go ahead and let the game upload. That makes everyone elses downloads (like mine!) go faster! hooray! 

I just wanted to clarify all this info cause i used to be like you guys and was totally confused and pissed off since i didn't know what to do! "

When i mount the iso on D then it says OBLIVION has stopped working. I think the game.exe is messed up? The name is APPCRASH and it is Oblivion.exe
