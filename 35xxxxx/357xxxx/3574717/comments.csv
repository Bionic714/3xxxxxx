[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-11T05:03Z,"meant S03E08, of course, the episode that aired recently"
,gregersamsa,2006-12-11T13:06Z,"I'm sure you meant s02e08 :-D But you're right - it's the eighth episode of the second season, the second season hasn't ended yet and won't for a while so anything from season three is misslabeled. Which seems to be a disease on the net sometimes... Family Guy suffers from the same affliction. Weird that both Seth McFarlane's series have this problem... Maybe viewers of his shows are more stupid than the general population? Nah... "
[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-12T07:39Z,Yes of course I meant s02e08. I can't write things right at 5 in the morning (GMT) ;)

Many Thanks to ye TedSharer:)"
