   Nikon Camera Control Pro is a useful stand alone remote
   camera control software that allows full control of
   all aspects of the camera prior to shooting, and
   the subsequent extraction of files afterwards.


   The remote control software is compatible with 
   supported wired and wireless interfaces. Extremely
   useful in high production studio environments like
   packshot photography, thumbnail images can be
   viewed on screen during transfer.
