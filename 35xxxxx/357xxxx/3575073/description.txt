Synopsis

A gallery of high-living lowlifes will stop at nothing to get their sweaty hands on a jewel-encrusted falcon. Detective Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) wants to find out why -and who?s gonna take the fall. This third screen version of Dashiell Hammett?s novel is a film of firsts: John Huston?s directorial debut, rotund 62-year-old Sydney Greenstreet?s screen debut, film history?s first film noir and Bogart?s breakthrough role after years as a Warner contract player. When George Raft refused to work with a first-time director, Bogart took on the role of Spade -and launched the most acclaimed period of his career.
