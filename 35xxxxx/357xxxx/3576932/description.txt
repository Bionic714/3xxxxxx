OFSET's attempt to address the shortage of physics teaching in schools; 700 MB of open-source science educational material. Do your homework, then it's worth a science teacher's time to teach you from there. And share, improve, and give feedback, by all means This version presented as a screensaver for Microsoft Windows; there are hundreds of millions of machines that could run it. If you want the bootable CD, look around inside the 'iso'; it's there. The screensaver takes a while to start; probably best to go for lunch while it starts saving your screen. Be patient ! To end the screensaver, Ctrl-Alt-F and click the X.
