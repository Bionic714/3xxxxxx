,vixen-of-alcatraz,2008-10-06T14:52Z,Avast is saying that this is a Trojan. I'll test it out on my test bed PC anyway.
,alanevil,2008-10-08T22:34Z,Contains a virus.  VirusScan deletes it immediately upon completion.  Don't waste your time.
,vixen-of-alcatraz,2008-10-12T18:53Z,"Too right, it has infected my testbed PC so don't download it!!! It's a right bastard, just like the c**t who created it."

,Xyrloph,2009-01-30T08:37Z,Is it really a virus on this keygen? Anti-Virusprograms always think keygens are virus even then they don't contain any...
,gyaradon,2009-12-23T07:31Z,"Let me tell you here and now that this is the real keygen, not a virus. You made all this fuss for nothing. Your virus scanners are reporting a false positive, which happens sometimes with keygens. I've used this on my computer, and it's 100% the real thing."
