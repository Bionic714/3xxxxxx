Wiki:
Bjørn Lomborg (born January 6, 1965) is an Adjunct Professor at the Copenhagen Business School and a former director of the Environmental Assessment Institute in Copenhagen. He became internationally-known for his best-selling and controversial book The Skeptical Environmentalist. After the book\'s publication, members of the Danish scientific community accused Lomborg of scientific dishonesty. These allegations were investigated by appropriate arms of the Danish government and in the end, no official charges were left standing. However, many scientists ? including the majority of climatologists ? remain critical of Lomborg\'s work.

In 2002, Lomborg and the Environmental Assessment Institute founded the Copenhagen Consensus, which sought to establish priorities for advancing global welfare using methodologies based on the theory of welfare economics.
