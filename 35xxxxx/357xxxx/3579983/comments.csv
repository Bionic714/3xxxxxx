,malhalla,2011-04-29T04:32Z,"Terrible serie to get a complete discography of. I'm getting very close tho. I don't settle with single files, want all tracks. Currently 26 albums. I need cue file for live@goliath 3 and 9. Then it's complete, I think ;)
Wish TPB had some way for users to PM each other. Find me those two files and a super goliath torrent will come."
