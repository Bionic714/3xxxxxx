[T],Bowen83,2006-12-11T15:45Z,"It says that there is NO swedish subtitle... And if there WOULD be a swedish subtitle, it would be in a separate .srt file."
,rhum_guardian,2006-12-14T08:42Z,"Thanks for the reply. Unfortutately the aspect ratio is wrong. The height is smaller than it should. This defect was already present in a previous torrent iploaded some months ago.

It is posible to view it correctly with NERO Showtime by setting the aspect ratio to 12:9. 

But if you want to convert to a DVD (MPEG-2) it may prove very hard. I will try some tools and if I succeed I'll report it here..."
