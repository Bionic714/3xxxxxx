The ""R"" in ""DVDR"" is for replica like you write yourself while DVDRip is the CD sized crap some prefer."
,MethodLoser,2006-12-18T02:10Z,"Because I'm retarded. But hey, the size and category are right, so let it slide."
,MethodLoser,2006-12-18T03:15Z,"By the way, if anyone has full DVD requests, I have almost 200 DVDs, TV episodes, etc. Some rare shit, too. Make some requests, if it's needed. If I could find somewhere to upload a html list to, I would."
,KurkoDokoljenko,2006-12-18T04:14Z,"I'd like ""Nine months"" if you have. Would be really thankfull. Thanks for this one"

,MethodLoser,2007-01-11T09:16Z,"I'm done seeding this one, I'm trying to pump out cool DVDRs, so I kinda need all you to help me with the seeding thing. Right now I'm on Story of a Junkie-

,titestef,2007-02-09T04:34Z,"Hi, I downloaded it , but there is a problem at the end of chapter 9 and the beginning of chapter 10 of the DVD !!!  Result : I lose 3 minutes and 1/2.   Seeding not completely succeeded by you ? or your original DVD has a problem ? "
,titestef,2007-07-20T18:57Z,"thanks for the help, but I don't know if it's possible to fix it in MAC OS X. I'll try"

,bokuma,2008-03-10T05:34Z,"This is the third time I downloaded this movie, because I saw ''gothic-rose'' apparently solved the corrupted chaper issue, but I'm unable to solve it myself as PGCedit gives me some NAVPack error ...

To ''gothic-rose'': Can you please give me a little bit more detailed explanation of your fix method ...

To everyone else who downloaded this torrent: Is there any other solution ... Has anyone experienced same problems with this movie ...

CHEERS"
,ardepark,2008-03-18T03:29Z,I would LOVE it if you'd upload American Pop.  I can't find a torrent for it anywhere.  I have the VHS but no technology to rip it.
,dlanod,2008-11-22T12:34Z,"This is a really a great movie!
I bought the original because a missing chapter issue cannot be ""solved"".
Let me know how to bring it up if there is still interest."
,borivoje,2008-12-05T02:19Z,"To ''dlanod'' ...

Of course there's interest. Just ripp it and find any simplest guide for uploading a movie through ''Vuze'', ''uTorrent'' or some other client. And that's it.

I tried million ways to fix this one, with no luck."
,dlanod,2009-01-01T22:05Z,"!!! REPAIR KIT !!!
===========

!!! + GERMAN LANGUAGE TRACK !!!

@borivoje 
Because I have a very low upload I created a
REPAIR KIT for this set of files. Additionally I attached the German language track.
All together it is about 270MB.

The system here doesn't accept uploading a zip-torrent. :(

Please contact me via the forum!"
,borivoje,2009-01-05T01:31Z,"@dlanod

I can't find you on forum under the name ''dlanod'' ...

It doesn't have to be zip. file ... Unzip it in the folder named ''Heavy Traffic Repair Kit'' or something, post an explanation and make an upload ...

CHEERS
"
,borivoje,2009-01-05T01:36Z,"@dlanod

Silly me ...

After writing previous message I saw that you already posted ''Repair Kit'' ...

I'll have to downlaod the movie again before I try ''Repair Kit'' ... I'll let you know if it's working ...

MANY THANKS"
,dlanod,2009-01-07T15:40Z,"@borivoje

I'm very sorry - the file has crashed :(
Pleas contact me trough the forum (send me a PM!)"
,borivoje,2009-01-16T02:39Z,"@ dlanod

I still can't find you on forum, but I say here - You are a MAGICIAN ... After four downloadings of the same movie and more than a year trying to fix it with dozens of tools it was fixed in just a few clicks ...

HUUUUGE THANKS DLANOD

I'll keep seeding dlanod's ''Heavy Traffic Repair Kit'' for anyone who wants to fix it, although I can't find the torrent in ''Pirate Bay'' search any more.

CHEERS "
,dilbertgeg,2009-06-25T11:18Z,"This looks like a GREAT! flick with live ppl and animation. Only skimmed it.

FYI
PGCEdit 
I use that PGCEdit to make *good* and *clean* ISOs.  It ""maps"" file structure and spacing and fixes bad dvd mappings. Read about it, it's over my head.

PGCEdit says there's some problem with files in VIDEO_TS left over from Ripper.  

So I re-ripped with DVDshrink and then PGCEdit had no complaints.

Do not know if orig ISO would have been ok."
,dilbertgeg,2010-05-31T16:00Z,"um, I'm an idiot, i posted my cmt before reading all the other comments about the damaged chapter, duh"
,reverendjon,2011-03-26T09:59Z,"Any way I could get that repair kit?

email tim_tiplin AT yahoo DOT com"
,gassymule,2011-05-19T06:29Z,"i got involed in some forum and i still cant find it, damn"
,M1SF1T13,2011-05-20T06:01Z,So how do I get this repair kit???  Can Someone upload a version of this movie that isn't fucked up?
