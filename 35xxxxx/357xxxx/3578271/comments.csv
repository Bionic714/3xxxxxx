,Spoonto,2006-12-17T14:48Z,Is it easy for someone who have never ever created a video game to use this program?
,Littlegrenman,2006-12-17T16:57Z,Well dude i've never written a program but i have been messing with it. Im sure i can find some tutorials online some where.
,Spoonto,2006-12-17T22:37Z,Yeah I guess :) if u ever come over some of those tutorials would you link them?
,Spoonto,2006-12-18T08:33Z,"uhm btw, the installation says invalid serial... what should I do?"
,Littlegrenman,2006-12-19T00:16Z,Hey Spoonto email me @ Littlegrenman@yahoo.com 
,mirwits,2007-01-17T10:26Z,Hey I downloaded the iso but the installer doesn't seem to work even the keygen doesn't work... The rest of you guys had a problem with running the installer.exe?? 
,Littlegrenman,2007-02-10T19:54Z,"Hey mirwits, i didnt have any problems it just took me a while to do it. Give me sometime to reinstall and i'll get back at you."

,Madventurer,2007-12-19T20:28Z,"Does this include the solution for PSP? I installed it, but could not find the PSP exporter, or anything that point to PSP system. I searc even the help and tutorials folders, but still no any signs about PSP :( If the solution is not included, does someone know where I can get it?"
,J_Walk,2008-02-08T05:31Z,i was about to ask for helpp but i figured it out. you just have to run the keygen first. i had to delete the files and unpack them again tho. so just to check can this program port games to a console. i have a little programming experience and im willing to learn whats neccessary but i need to know if this program is worth it.
,J_Walk,2008-02-08T18:58Z,question. this will port to the xbox right. it has xbox input so i assume it is there for a reason but how would i go about exporting it to xbox. does it take any coding whatsoever and if so what codes would i need to modify. also do i need a certain type of disc to work with the xbox?
,Jman747,2008-06-28T00:43Z,Thank you!! Worked well and downloaded pretty quick! (Was around 150-300 kB/s) 
,Jman747,2008-06-28T01:04Z,"Also- MOST KEYGENS DO NOT WORK!

Use this working one- w84pg1cgf5-0XPRRW2VR"
,mohvijan,2008-10-27T15:15Z,Please seed ppl! I really need Virtools badly!
,dcrowe,2009-02-10T17:36Z,"I got this so that I can open a .nmo file, and still no luck, any advice?"
,KoichiSenada,2009-09-19T12:26Z,"dcrowe, NMO files are to be imported, not opened!
CMO files are to be opened.
By the way, do you guys have MultiUser Server and VR licenses? How do you get one?"
,Datron,2009-10-11T20:05Z,"i downloaded all fine, install works, ok, and when i launch the software, it appear a window ""FLEXIm license finder"" wich want to search some license file, that i have to obtain with a mail from virtools... how can i receive a mail from virtools? This is not an official version... so... what should i do? Can it be that exist some software that can create this license file? "
,gelamac74,2010-10-29T10:43Z,i found the virtools 5.0  with crack   works perfect
