PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Dassault Systemes Virtools v4.0.0.26

The Virtools 4 Life Platform ushers in a unique solution for pervasively
developing and deploying 3D experiences on personal computers, game
consoles, Intranets and the web, demonstrating Dassault Systemes
commitment to bringing the power of 3D to all user communities.

The open-ended architecture of Virtools 4 supports a wide variety of 3D
formats. 3D Content Capture plugins support most commonly used DCC
software formats (3ds Max, Maya, XSI, Lightwave, Collada) for importing
and exporting 3D XML files, making real-time 3D technology easily
available.

Now based on the new Product-Context-Scenario (PCS) paradigm, Virtools 4
allows users to imagine, share and experience highly interactive 3D
content. This new paradigm represents a highly intuitive means of
capturing the 3D experience and easily mapping product behavior, along
with contextual environment scenarios.

With PCS, the Virtools 4 Life Platform enables easy development of
virtual experiences such as driving, shopping, product use, maintenance
and marketing tests.

Virtools 4 also extends the range of target environments for deploying 3D
experiences: Microsoft Windows and Apple MacOS computers, Microsoft Xbox
and Sony PSP game consoles, Intranets via 3D Office and 3D XE Players,
Internet via the 3D Life Player, as well as immersive environments via
the VR Library.

This broad scope highlights the diversity of potential deployment options
and provides a large range of communities with a powerful solution to
create and experience life content.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Unrar, Burn or mount with Daemon Tools.

2. Use our keygen in the CRACK dir to generate a Serial and License file.

3. Enjoy!

PS. We are aware that if you select only the ?Multiuser Server? install
item it will complain, it was that way on the original DVD too,
however it is installed as part of an full normal Virtools install,
and it is enabled in the License file.

We are a new group, dedicated to quality and not quantity, more info coming!

Many times we?ve walked the line, longing for the other side?

?So we pack our bags and ride into the sunset
We don?t know where we?re gonna go but that don?t matter at all
We?re gonna do it our way and we don?t change for no one
Cause we?re living on the EDGE and we got nothing to lose?
