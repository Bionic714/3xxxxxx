,ShiningSun,2006-12-29T01:06Z,"Anybody else having trouble with getting this running, crack included doesnt seem to allow the game to run...=/"

,Ulquiorra,2008-03-23T22:30Z,"I keep getting an error saying ""create cursor texture fail"" and it just closes"
,katsumoto22,2008-03-30T05:04Z,"I also keep getting the ""create cursor texture fail"" error, when I run the crack psi ops.exe 

When I run it from the desktop or the start menu, it tells me I need administrative level privlages or something. Even when I run it as an Administrator.

What am I supposed to do with the crack? Run it? Put it some where? Please help."
,katsumoto22,2008-03-30T05:30Z,"After I reinstalled it, that error no longer comes up saying I need adminstrative rights. Now the starforce copy protection system tells me ""enter a disk key for the disk labeled PSIOPS.

I try anything, and it says it's incorrect. I need some kind of crack.

But when i click on the crack provided, it says it couldn't create the cursor texture, and closes.   Please help!

Will seed for help!"
,Zell65,2008-04-10T07:24Z,"I have a similar problem as these guys but mine gives no error. I run the .exe, it shows up on my taskbar and in the same instant it's gone."
,Zell65,2008-04-10T07:32Z,"I like this woodrick guy, he tells us to ""bare with [him] if it is not working"" then provides no help for the many people who this is not working for."
,noseman-2,2008-04-29T13:03Z,"I've never seen such a bunch of inefficient little wannabe-pirates whining on the boards in my life.

Don't you people know anything about getting games to work anymore???"
,tikkig0d,2008-06-07T21:30Z,I.E if the crack doesnt work find another 1

,pietastesgood,2008-11-29T06:03Z,"What the hell? I got it installed but when I launch the game nothing comes up. I monitor the progress w/ task manager, and psiops.exe comes up for 5 seconds, then goes away. any ideas?"
,eman188,2008-12-12T01:36Z,"really looking forward to this game!

please seed if you will"
,eman188,2008-12-12T21:29Z,"my computer has a stable internet connection.
i seed all the time.
if i get this all the way downloaded, there will be less ""plz seed!"" comments. :)"
,eman188,2008-12-14T18:08Z,"hey tikkig0d, where did you find your crack?  all the stuff i'm finding when i search is crap"
,Cyndrus,2009-03-21T10:35Z,"For those getting the cursor texture message, you're supposed to move the contents of the crack folder into wherever you installed the game (Program Files> ZOO Digital Publishing> Psi Ops).. Worked for me.


Its pretty obvious this is a port of a console game, the controls just don't feel right with a m&k. Too floaty for me."
,tikkig0d,2009-05-25T20:41Z,"well there is a crack that comes with the cd that i used and it worked, but i found one on either gamecopyworld or crack.ms i dont remember which one i used ..I've been playing this game for a while, hope that helps  ~~~~~!!!SEEDING!!"
,Clerk13,2009-08-09T20:40Z,"I go to run the setup.exe on the game, and it tells me that it can't find 2 .dll files that are clearly in the folder. Wassup with that?"
,Alanour,2009-08-19T13:54Z,"keep up the good work woodrick
ps: the game works like a charm"
,Spyker_Cool,2010-03-04T13:29Z,"Dont waste time downloading this thing
You cant open the setup
its says missing GS.DLL AND GS2K.DLL

The games awesome but I cant open this stupid setup so goodbye"
,matsman123,2010-03-12T16:22Z,if i start setup it says ''Cannot find the dll: d:\GSxp.dll and ''Cannot find the dll: c:\gsd.ll T_T
,gordonfre,2010-04-30T00:21Z,this sucks i cant even play the damn crap
,RedScorpionX,2010-05-01T11:31Z,"Alrighty I'm pretty new to this whole using crack thing.
Anyways, I dl'ed the game, installed it using Daemon Tools and then used the crack and put it in the folder.
But when I open the game it is appearing for 5 seconds and then disappears."
,Ryan1875,2010-05-14T18:15Z,"For those that can't play this what you need to do is get a program like Power ISO and then copy the crack folder to the folder where you installed the game, when that is done, you need to replace the files Psi Ops and protect.dll with the two files with the same name from the crack folder, then click on the application and it should run, perfectly fine, if you have any problems just leave a comment and I'll try to get back to you as it would appear that the uploader has never explained what to do to those who don't fully understand what needs to be done in order to play this game"
,Omnioast,2010-06-19T13:26Z,"Seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed
Im getting 10 byte per sec here...
Damn impossible speed lol"
,Toxic.Trioxide,2010-11-27T20:04Z,"I put the crack in the folder along with the other file, but the game still does Not run. It just opens then closes after a second or two. . . Help?"
,HowitzerPhat,2010-12-29T19:42Z,"the game works just fine,im running it on windows 7 64bit system......thx to uploader

,xXxmechagodzillaxXx,2011-05-31T03:04Z,i downloaded this cracked it correctly and still didnt work after i tried to uninstall it it wouldnt so i would highly recommend not downloading this
,Yipman2,2011-06-02T12:27Z,"Worked for me, im on windows 7, 64bit. It does not work unless you aply the crack. The game should be in a file called Zoodirect or something like that, and than you copy and paste the files in the ""CRACK"" Folder , and paste it in the zoo direct folder. than select copy and replace for both files than complete !"
,ZtorkX86,2011-08-24T22:10Z,Has anyoned been able to play this game in 60FPS with Windows 7? I remember not having the 30FPS cap in XP but I may be mistaken.
,Admin.Hammink,2012-01-17T18:33Z,"If u guyes can't download with a good speed or something, PAY OR BETTER INTERNET! you think people will give you the game in a sec or something we all try our best!"
