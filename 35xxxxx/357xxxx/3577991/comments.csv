it's a stupid program! 

It is much better to use Windows own Paint function, because you can use the spray-cans with many fine colours and fix on the pictures perfectly! And you can use the pencil and write your name or what ever directly on the picture too!!!"

,dagada,2006-12-16T21:00Z,"Here is how to crack Photoshop CS3 and get rid of the trial period:
1) Complete the installation as usual
2) Go to \Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS3\AMT
3) Rename the file called application.sif to something else, like application.sif_ "
,aik_putte,2006-12-16T21:59Z,That tip works but then it popups a message that says that some application is wrong and you have to reinstall it.
,Shabazia,2006-12-17T04:39Z,Liiv du är min idol!
,bizzarefoods,2006-12-17T17:12Z,"Thanks for that way of ""activating"" it worked great...if you get an popup message its probably cause you had photoshop open while you were changing the file (*hint* never edit a prpgram with it open)"
,kukruneskuk,2006-12-17T23:30Z,"""liiiv"" I agree with u man...why do people use worthless photoshop when they can write their own name with the pencil at the pic´s...
And then the whole thing is fixed...even color prob´s...lightning and cloning....dumbass keep on coloring your pictures with your birthday watercolor present..hehe."

,Man Machine,2006-12-18T23:08Z,"I am afraid it doesn't work for me. I installed the application on Saturday and used without any problems just until eatrlier tonight.

Now I get this message:

""The licensing subsystem has failed catastrophically. You must reinstall or call customer support.""

Anyone else got this problem? Any suggestions as how to get rid of it?"

If you don't know how this program works then DON'T use it, instead of pissing other people of with your idiotic comments. I happen to use this program since Photoshop 5.5 and it's still working with me!! So I suggest that you at least take a tutorial and learn the basics, instead comment things like: 

""it's a stupid program! 

It is much better to use Windows own Paint function, because you can use the spray-cans with many fine colours and fix on the pictures perfectly! And you can use the pencil and write your name or what ever directly on the picture too!!!""

first spray-can is called an airbrush in photoshop
second you can put your name in a nice font with the text-tool

By the way, wackopath your totally right :)"

,aprop,2007-01-23T22:53Z,"I have downloaded the software but when I tried to install it by clicking Setup.exe file, I get a massage saying that ""close all Internet Exploerer application""  Please let me know if I am doing something wrong. Thanks. My e-mail is aprop@hotmail.com."
,dook169,2007-01-31T02:28Z,i know this is stupid but why cant I download this file
,Kerri Kwong,2007-02-02T05:04Z,"You guys are obviously stupid. Adobe Photoshop are for professionals. You can go use that crappy Microsoft Paint and write your name.
Adobe Photoshop is for image editing, basically made for graphic and webdesigners.
You literally don't know shiit."
,ogge7,2007-02-06T21:53Z,@QmAn That shit works great.. FOR 30 DAYS! It only removes the popup that asks for a key.
,Kirayatail,2007-04-17T08:39Z,"30 days? BS! For those who have no authentic serial for CS2, this beta only works in three days... Does anyone know of any real crack for PSCS3?"
