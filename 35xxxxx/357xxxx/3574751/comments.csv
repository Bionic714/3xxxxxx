,JohnyFiama,2006-12-20T21:05Z,"In my opinion, this is *THE* anti-virus program! Another good competetor is Kaspersky but if you prefer speed, NOD32 is far more superior and yet very secure. Forget the bloated Norton (Symantec) and McAfee (Network Associates). Those are just popular trademarks because ""WorseBuy"".. oh, I mean ""BestBuy"" and other big retail stores distribute their junk as well as various PC vendors that actively bundle their piece-of-shit-softwares in the OS. Not to mention, they bribe popular software distribution companies like C|NET, to mention one (Ever heard of the notorious Ken Feinstein C|NET reviewer? If not, then you might wanna google it!). But, what is popular doesn't mean it's good. Too pity, only a few people have heard of this *excellent* product. Thanks hueson this great security software! :) 10 Thumbs up from Sweden!!"
,JohnyFiama,2006-12-20T21:25Z,"For optimized protection, here's a great tutorial, written by ""Blackspear"" (the moderator of NOD32 Wilders Security Forum). This will make sure that you don't see any alerts popping up when a virus has been found, while protecting you from all different threats. I personally recommend this tutorial to every hardcore NOD32 user.

NOTE: the 2.7x version has slightly different configuration from the 2.5 version, described in the guide. However, these changes har not very significant.

Here's the URL: http://www.wilderssecurity.com/showthread.php?t=37509

Finally, here's a cool screenshot of the new up-coming software from Eset (it's currently in development): http://tech.cybernetnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/Nod32v3.gif"

,Hypnosis4U2NV,2006-12-21T05:11Z,Can anyone recommend a firewall that is compatible with NOD32?  I have ZoneAlarm and the install says its not compatible with NOD32..
,penol738,2006-12-21T12:20Z,try Comodo Firewall. it's free and should work with Nod
,Hypnosis4U2NV,2006-12-21T20:02Z,"Hey thanks.. I just ditched ZoneAlarm completely now.. I switched to Jetico v1 because of its low overhead on the system and because Jetico v2 is in beta and buggy..  I would go with Comodo but the latest version is bug filled and is heavy on the resources..  I gotta say my system is running even faster now.. When I get a chance I will try NOD32 over Kaspersky v6 to see how much better it is.. Ive see that NOD32 is way better at catching new virus variants over Kaspersky which is good if you download torrents and over P2P networks..

Heres a link you can go to for firewall ratings:

Another review shows that Outpost v3 underperformed Jetico v1..
