[T],BeastG,2006-12-06T21:58Z,"it works on my G6lite..just tested it..

Nice game! "
,Zamboro,2006-12-07T09:01Z,"What do you mean, ""how do you use this""? The DS uses cartridges. Therefore what you need is a writable cartridge. You'd think any idiot could figure that out.

Now go hit up Google and do your homework before you bother everyone else with dumb questions."
,winzentween,2006-12-11T22:42Z,"a whole batch of Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin were faulty so if your back up rom freezes on menus etc. its a back up of one of the faulty releases, push for a non faulty release."
,nikoltjev,2006-12-13T18:15Z,"winzentween, sorry but that's not true (read: it's bullshit). It's only certain cards that has those kind of problems. In fact, it seems to be limited to flashcarts using mini-SD as storage solution. A G6 is guranteed to work fine in this case since it has built-in flash memory. "
,Noremal,2006-12-14T19:28Z,"I'm using a Supercard-Lite (microSD) and it locks up when i enter menu/inventory. :(
It looked like a good game, too..."
[T],BeastG,2006-12-15T13:45Z,Buy a G6 or DS-X...works perfect on those cards...
,Noremal,2006-12-23T01:03Z,"I am using the latest versions but it still freezes every now and then, what am i doing wrong? 
What settings should i use when i patch the rom?"
,Eddieh1979,2006-12-28T07:17Z,"Doesn't run on my regular supercard sd, works fine on my supercard rumble (mini sd). Same rom, two different results. You need HIGH SPEED card to play this game"
,Sugarcane_Spear,2007-09-09T01:16Z,"Guys I have got great news for all of u,I found a patch for Castlevania-Portrait of ruin that made it work without crashing,I played for hours and I am soooo damn happy,all u guys have to do is download the file and click on the castlevania game which overwrites it and then save the rom wherever u want it to and thats it u can play the game without any crashes,here is the web to download the patch-

have alot of fun"
,sh0nuff,2009-04-01T13:17Z,"@ Sugarcane_Spear:

This ""patch"" reduces the size of the ROM by 20 MB, and while it might no longer crash on the menu screen, it still crashed for me on the R4 card during first boss fight"
