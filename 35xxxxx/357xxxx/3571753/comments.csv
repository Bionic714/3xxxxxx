Thanks a lot! 
I always wanted to buy this this recording, but it's out of print. At least now i can listen to it."
,Rubentz,2008-06-05T20:56Z,Thanks a lot! I heard a piece of this on the radio yesterday and got stuck for it big time!

,BaXXoP,2009-07-15T08:05Z,"Thanks! Looking forward to this. When I get my rig set up I have some original recordings by mahler, faure and pachowski to upload & share"
,scoobydoo2u2,2009-10-24T23:59Z,"Thanks for the upload but this is in MP3 format, not exactly ideal for this type of music. FLAC etc would be better.

I checked against the original playlist and there are pieces missing. There are only 65 out of the original 70 movements. The deleted movements are from the 2nd, 3rd and 4th discs. They seem to be deleted at random. You can also see from the MP3 tags that parts are missing. Why did you delete those parts? Was it to reduce the size? Admittedly Telemann may not be one of the Great Composers, but it's still no reason to edit out his music. It can't have been that boring can it? LOL. ;-)

Peace. Cheers. And Thanks again for the up."
