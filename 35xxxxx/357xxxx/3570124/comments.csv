,sal,2006-12-03T23:56Z,"to save you either need a jap format memory card or a empty one(that means with noi saves on)

now you know!

thankyou uploader.

,gammelkorv,2006-12-04T09:25Z,my mem card has pal games on it and now zelda ..no problem with loading or anything ..just shows that u can have both :P
,elyk1212,2006-12-04T11:08Z,Wow totally cool!  So has anyone leaked US version?
,sal,2006-12-04T13:31Z,"yes it does save to memory card!idiots at blackcats.mind you i should have tried it first.

bad news playing jap.all you end up doing is running around.nice game,although wind waker has the better graphics!

a waste of a disc if you dont know how to read jap.
:-)"
,Snytbaggen,2006-12-04T14:20Z,"gammelkorv: vad jag har hört så kan minneskortet bli korrupt om man har både EU/USA och japanska sparfiler på samma kort. Visst funkar det att ha båda, men jag tänker inte ta risken :)

From what i've heard your memory card can get corrupt if you have both EU/USA and japanese saves on it. Of course it works to have both, but i won't take the risk :)"

Who told you that!?  It is not at though there is a different byte offset or byte order.... they are the same machine!  I doubt this is the case, unless someone really messed up I/O controls in the GC (unlikely).  Please site a reference so I can look into this.

""i've downloaded it ......but how do i play it on the gamecube..?""

Well, get a mod chip on your GameCube and burn the image to a Ritek G04 or G05 DVD-R (mini, or full size if you have a modded case or play with case off). :)"
,elyk1212,2006-12-05T17:48Z,"BTW, by same machine I am referring to the CPU, bus, cache organization/memory, etc, not to all peripherals (digital outs on some GC, not on others, etc)."
,M-SwEDen,2006-12-05T19:26Z,"I can't save NTSC and PAL games on the same memorycard. If I try I'll just get a message that I'll need to format my mem. (cube with zeno gc)

,244 dl,2006-12-06T22:26Z,dax o seeda??
,beyondtool,2006-12-08T08:26Z,"Apakarta, yeah get a gamecube that will make it run nice and fast.

Gamecube emulation is never likely to get fast enough to play on a PC at least not until CPU's get a lot faster.."
,Apakarta,2006-12-08T16:23Z,But i have very much in CPU
,axellagerlf,2006-12-09T21:55Z,"It Works!

Burned it to a regular fujifilm dvd-r and altough the However things get really hard to figure out since its in Japanese....."
,axellagerlf,2006-12-09T21:57Z,ANd I did not experience any problem with the memory card.
,sal,2006-12-09T22:21Z,"i was the first person to post about memory card!

so the person whos asking about where did you hear that,go blackcats and read the comments for the torrent.thats why I posted.

basicly couldn't give a shit whether it saves or dosnt,bla bla bla.

the game sux in jap,it renders the fucker impossible to play unless you can read jap.

the graphics are okay.but,compared to wind waker they are realy shit since this one was said to be a lot better game.the gameplay has changed and i'm sure it can only get better(if you understand jap)lucky i got replacement lid that takes full blown dvdr and not mini.

a fucking waste of download.i played it for about half hour and threw it in the bin.

thanks all the same to the uploader but,the english version gets released something like 12-20 here in uk/us.

so i look forward to playing a game that i understand.
:-)"
,rasmus1991,2006-12-10T14:16Z,"hallo all

i have a problem.
then have the iso file i have to make it into a GCM file but i dont know how to do that.

can someone please help me..?;D"
,elyk1212,2006-12-12T09:09Z,"""so the person whos asking about where did you hear that,go blackcats and read the comments for the torrent.thats why I posted.""

Thx., I will look into this.  However, I think that problem may be related to a file system error on their mem card.   Has anyone experienced an error message creating the save?  If so, can you post the message please?  I will look into it.   I haven't had any issues here... I am using a third part memory card from Niko 64mb.

""I can't save NTSC and PAL games on the same memorycard. If I try I'll just get a message that I'll need to format my mem. (cube with zeno gc)""

I have both PAL and NTSC games running on my Cube, and with save files coexisting.  Can you please post the exact error message.  The problem may be related to the conclusion above (file system issue, etc).

 Have you been able to create a new save file at all on this card?  Also, have you checked the capacity to see if there is enough room on the card?"
,Robinhero,2006-12-13T14:40Z,"US Version? ANYONE?? Please? It´s on bittorment, but they don´t accept any new members :("

,ihatefall,2009-06-15T19:57Z,"Hey rasmus1991

If you need a GCM file just rename it, if you need a iso file just rename it. 

I do this all the time, sometimes I just want one disc so I burn an iso but sometimes I want more than one game on a disc so I rename it a GCM and make it a mutlidisc. Its really that easy! "
