,T0nT0n,2006-12-18T05:14Z,be aware that this will not work on any XP machines in any compatability mode.
,PraecepsUK,2006-12-18T12:13Z,"Yeah I was thinking that was the case, I just wasn't sure.

I've heard others being able to play theirs on their own xp pcs, I think it's most likely the US versions that works. 

So I'd recommend either Win95/98/ME/2000 to play.

Sorry to those who wanted to use it for Xp."
