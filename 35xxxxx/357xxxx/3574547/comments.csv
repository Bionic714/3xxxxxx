Any help please."
,chaos_dreamhelper,2006-12-11T09:45Z,"We got the same Error* ""Please Insert the correct CD-Rom"""
,chaos_dreamhelper,2006-12-11T09:46Z,Anyway Thxs!! bb :)
[T],stevekasian,2006-12-11T10:44Z,"I'm just ""sayin'"" - so don't flame me if it ain't the case here - 99 times out of 100, whenever you find any .exe called ""start"", it's a virus. So you you all better check your computers if you haven't already.
Remember: START.EXE and CRACK.EXE USUALLY = VIRUS."
[T],stevekasian,2006-12-11T10:46Z,... I'm sure blankbox can inform us if he's already checked it or not... right?
,buffybill,2006-12-11T11:57Z,"First thing i done was check for virus. Comes up clean. To me it seems as if the files have to be converted to an ""image"", but what the correct image title is I have no idea."
[T],stevekasian,2006-12-11T12:41Z,"buffybill: Which antivirus didjoo use? Best is NoD32, Sophos or Panda. Don't ever trust Norton Or McAffe. They're complete shit."
,blankbox,2006-12-11T16:00Z,"...hmmmm troubles huh ??

Try this...open your main folder..inside you'll find another folder called DATA

..OPEN IT

...CREATE another folder here....XX ....or whatever..

NOW....see the data1.cab ???? ...EXTRACT contents into XX
.....I gave you a tool to do it....but winzip is supposed to work so is your call
....rest you should be able to handle..."
,atrofiado,2006-12-11T19:36Z,Ok!! Just Flight are protected CDs. So whatÂ´s up is that he surelly copied CDs and made an upload of torrent. Without a proper crack (to ignore search for original CD) canÂ´t install. Be patient and wait for a crack. Sure it will appear sonner or later. TKS anyway for the upload.
