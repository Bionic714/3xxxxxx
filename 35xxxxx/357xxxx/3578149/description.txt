dnl-tdu.073

Here it is, got it off my trial account on usenext. Got TEst Drive Unlimited in your DL queue for days now, stuck at 99.9%? So was I.

I got this file, put it with the rest of the files (replacing the incomplete dnl-tdu.073) and I was able to unrar the 000.iso and 000.dvd file. Couldn't burn yet tho.

Have fun, I will seed for a few days!
