,Enzio_Ferrari,2007-02-03T15:25Z,"I actually bought SS II, but the installation got corrupted and wouldn't reload from the original disc. This is a 'life-saver'.
Downloaded and installed without any problems.
Excellent.
This version even works better with the No CD Patch installed than the original!
My thanks to the crew at RELAODED."

I've tried rebooting and I've tried reinstalling, but it's not working.

Help!"
,dlbrody69,2009-01-12T00:00Z,"Torjan Horse Generic8.WTW. is a false positive people..AVG reports allot of them, so does all the other ""known"" programs..good for general protection only. If you want complete protection from virus's and malware that even others will not detect then I highly suggest ""Malwarebytes""..seriously!!!!"
