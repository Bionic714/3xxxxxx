,shaheens,2006-12-20T04:48Z,"monorot..  something for your info:

1. Dr. Zakir is quoting points based on authentic scriptures.. (That too with references including chapter:verse!!)

2. There are many open minded people in this world who wish to understand about many religions and wish to come into a common term. The video is for them. Its a full video and not the like one you publish from here and there.

3. If you have any problem with Islam or with any religion, your criticism should be valid and should be based on the authentic sources, should not be some cut copy videos which hide the context.

:) Peace be on you. Thats Islamic way of doing things. "
,ttn82,2007-03-21T02:11Z,But.. then why do moslem people get mad so fast? Why do the police avoid the moslem neighbourhoods? Why did a friend of mine get a bomb threat from an islamic group? That has never happened in our community before!

It is always better to hear the other side of the story."
,rudaba7,2010-01-07T18:01Z,IT is a request to the non muslims to understand quran with proper understanding and with the hepl of a scholar because you are definitely being led astray. i dont get why you take some examples of stupid muslims and then judge our beautiful religion based on that only. you are most welcome to know islam but know this from the authentic sources dont judge what some terrorrist do .
