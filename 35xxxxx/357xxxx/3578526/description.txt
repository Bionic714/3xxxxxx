Join Mickey and all your favorite Disney animated superstars-together for the first time ever-as they share a heartwarming holiday celebration and sing a special song, "The Best Christmas Of All," that captures this wondrous occasion.
When a huge snowstorm leaves everyone stranded, Mickey and all of his guests at The House of Mouse, including Pooh, Piglet, Belle, Snow White, Ariel and many more of his old and new friends, break out the cookies and hot chocolate to help Donald mend his tattered Christmas spirit. The fun starts when Minnie pulls out their favorite holiday home movies and everyone starts to reminisce. Their magical memories soon put everyone in the Christmas mood-even grumpy Donald, who ultimately becomes the star of the evening. As everybody lifts their voices in joyful song, they realize that the "Best Christmas of All" is the one you share with all your friends!
