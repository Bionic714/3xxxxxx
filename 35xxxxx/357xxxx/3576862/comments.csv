,Shamanskunk,2009-01-14T08:09Z,Everywhere I read if you have a Slimline model SCPH-70000 or newer it won't work! Because there's no way to configure and install it with out a hard drive!!! And no where did it mention that Usb hard drives work!
,SynMonger,2012-03-23T07:49Z,"The original retail discs ran on kernel 2.2 which has NO support for external USB hard drives. This means that slim PS2 cannot install linux using these discs.

It also required the network/IDE adapter from the kit to be able to get online, which you need to do in order to download the kernel modules to get the modem/network/IDE adapter to work.

If you were ever able to get that far, then you could set up the blackrhino 2.4 kernel that had usb storage support."
