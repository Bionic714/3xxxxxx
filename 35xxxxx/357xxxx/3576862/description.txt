ISO images of the 2 DVDs in the Playstation 2 Linux kit for North America.  

These images are UNTESTED and have been posted for the PS2 hacking community to find a way to boot and install from them.

The PS2 Linux kit was last produced by Sony in 2004.

I have tried unsuccessfully to boot from DVD1 using Swap Magic 3.6 and a flip top case.

Good luck and thanks for your help!  Discussion thread to follow.
