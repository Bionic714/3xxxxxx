Product Description:
Deeper is the new studio album from David Wright and finds the artist at the peak of his creative prowess. Deeper is an imaginative, journey style offering with a strong sense of emotion and warmth pervading the album. There are strong themes, poignant melodies and lush orchestrations, all laced with atmospherics and underpinned with gentle percussion and sequences. Stylistically, the album is closer to his classic 'Walking with Ghosts' than the 2004 release 'Continuum', but Deeper is a much more evocative and symphonic album than any of his previous outings. Indeed, Deeper is probably the most complete David Wright album too date, showing the maturity of an artist at total ease with his music. Deeper is a must have for existing DW fans and will find favour with those who enjoy high quality melodic New Age emusic ("EM").
