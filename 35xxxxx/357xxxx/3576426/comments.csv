,oppressed,2006-12-15T18:35Z,"Seed! I`m uploading at 150 but only downloading at 0.5 to 1.5kb/s. At the beginning you were seeding at 100 kb/s atleast, what happend?"
,oppressed,2006-12-21T16:25Z,"We`re at 87,5% now, been downloading for 7days and 2hours. Maybe we`ll be able to watch this one tomorrow. I`ll be uploading in 150kb/s for a few weeks at least so hang in there!"
,Teddylein,2006-12-22T11:52Z,Thanks for that documentary Doodles. But I'm stucked at 90%. Would be great if you seed a bit longer.
,fmaack,2007-01-01T02:17Z,Please seed this. If there's one movie I'd like to watch it's this one. For anarchy's sake!
,Teddylein,2007-01-05T13:45Z,please seed!!! stucked at 90%...
,fmaack,2007-02-16T07:42Z,I gave up on this torrent long ago. The dude who uploaded it never fully seeded it. What a huge waste of time.
,octubre,2012-09-02T17:18Z,"if anyone is still looking for this movie...i've seen a 800mb version of this on another tracker, just do some googling to find it. "
