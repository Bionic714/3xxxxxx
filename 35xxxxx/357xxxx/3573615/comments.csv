,blaaman,2007-02-22T12:28Z,"This movie sucks...
So hyped, yet so bad.
After all the great reviews I read on this movie my only conclusion is that reviewers are acting herd of sheeps without a mind of their own. I would like to smack that stupid influencal idiot who first decided that this movie was good."
,snivlem666,2007-03-22T22:44Z,"this is one of the best movies recently released, if you are not into the hollywood thingies. People even left the theatre while i was watching this one. Beautiful and disgusting, especially the eating contest ... "
