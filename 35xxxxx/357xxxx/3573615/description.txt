Plot: 
Three stories. Three circles. Three men. Grandfather, fater, son. An officer, a sportsman and a taxidermist. One strives for love, other for success, the third for eternity. 
The grandfather lives among his fantasies, and tortures his servant that tries to bring some warmth in his freezing shack during cracking-cold winter time by jerking off in some extreemly inventive ways; his potency is unlimited. 
The father is gobbling and bulging. He is section leader for four years in sweets. He is actually unbeatable in waffers, his personal record is 2.98 (just for comparison, Igor Vostogonov won the European Championships in Sofia with 3.21).
The son stuffs animals. He was born with 3 pounds. Now he has less than 3 minutes left. He has been preparing for something that nobody did ever before.
