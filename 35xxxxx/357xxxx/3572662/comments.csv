A small observation: Track 15 'As Time Goes By' is named on the file by its Italian title 'Con Le Mie Lacrime' though it's not actually the Italian language version (which does exist elsewhere). Look forward to more uploads from you soon!"
,Hvafaen,2006-12-08T16:35Z,"Thank you. You have to blame Winamp for the mislabeling of the track, but I will doublecheck next time.
It takes a little effort to scan the covers, but you can look forward to more Stones bootlegs: ""Super Precious Tracks Vol. 4 (1966-1968)"", ""Thee Satanic Sessions - Olympic Years 1967-70"" and perhaps ""IBC DEMOS 1963"" (a 5-track single) if someones interested."
,alcocops,2006-12-08T17:28Z,"Would I be correct in assuming the IBC Demos single is the same 5 tracks which appear at the start of this 'Definitive Demos' album? If so, I guess anyone wanting those will get them on this torrent. Do you have the whole of the 'Satanic Sessions' series or just a single volume?  "
,Hvafaen,2006-12-08T17:37Z,"I've only got vol. 4. And you're right about the single being the 5 first tracks on this one, so I'm gonna drop that one.
I also have the Collectibles CD from Flashpoint. Gonna upload that one as well."
,zazafromjohor,2006-12-17T14:11Z,ok... files are protected by licence key!!!! all ten licences keys allowed were already downloaded!!!!
,Hvafaen,2006-12-19T00:47Z,"OK! I dont know anything about protected files and licence keys, but if anyone else have trouble with the files, just let me know and I will try to upload some unprotected files.
Strange that 207 people have downloaded this torrent and only one issues with protected files?!"
