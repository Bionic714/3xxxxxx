"
,rrodger99,2006-12-10T23:44Z,"Thanks,

I am going to do some xvid encoding on this to make it a bit more manageable

Just been a while since I have done any encoding so I need to read up a little."

,McPorra,2006-12-11T00:07Z,"Ho ho ho... Merry Christmas, rrodger99!!"
,neslesman,2006-12-11T00:17Z,"Yabadabadoo.  With this and FS2Crew I might actually figure out how to fly the big boys.

Many thanks roger.
P.S.  If this is from the newsnet it means many small rar files.  Do you just unrar one of them and it unrars the whole thing and reconstructs everythin?   I've never done one before so I don't really know how."
,LOgo55,2006-12-11T01:09Z,You are the man rrodger99 !
,rrodger99,2006-12-11T01:43Z,"@neslesman

These are all tested & extract fine.

Just unrar & you get an alcohol image file that you can mount with daemontools or burn to a dual layer dvd with dvd decrypter or alcohol .

This may take a while & I hope thatall will be patient. I am capped at 40kb/s up but I will seed until it's done. I hope some that got it from usenet might help me seed a bit quicker."
,WinnieXL,2006-12-11T02:03Z,Thanks for this. Really amazing. 
,Death091,2006-12-11T02:07Z,"Alright I got 93.3% off usenet before my bandwidth maxxed out, but i'll seed what i have"

,rrodger99,2006-12-12T04:30Z,"Well I have put my somewhat limited ripping skills to the test & have found out that they basically have 2 seperate movies on 1 dvd.
1 being the controls tutorials & the other actual flights & landings etc. Each 1 runs about 2 hours.Each rip is about 1.4gb which is better than the 5 here. I tried to fit each 1 on a single disc but the quality was truly bad. The dvd itself has issues video quain that it tries to bring over FS2004 graphics through a FRAPS type of capture...to degrade that further by compressing it to 700mb is a good thing.

I will up the 2 rips if there is an interest for those that didn't want to go the full 5gb but only if there is an interest in it. Remember we are looking at 2.8gb for the total of what's on the dvd and 4 discs."
,David-7237,2006-12-12T09:29Z,"how do I run the DVD??

it's mdf format?!"
,DonMorello,2006-12-12T18:13Z,Mount it in Daemon Tools
,David-7237,2006-12-14T08:02Z,"wow it's too big..

is there a way to put it together on a 700mb file?! like any other movie?"
,WinnieXL,2006-12-14T17:55Z,I have it now and thank you so much!!! It is great and i love this one. 
,neslesman,2006-12-14T19:22Z,"Here's some info on this great upload.  Thanks rr

""Are you a professional simmer? Would you like to be more on top of what you do in Flight Simulator? Look no further than Angle of Attack! 

We take you through the Level-D 767-300 and get you intimate with all it can do. Below are listed the many sections covered in this DVD, which totals over 5 1/2 hours! 

Although virtual simmers complete hundreds of flights a day, the majority are not doing it the way real pilots do it. Do you want to reach a higher level of realism?  ""

I am glad everyone liked the upload. I have tried to rip this but getting this to a couple of 700mb discs & keeping any kind of quality has been impossible."
