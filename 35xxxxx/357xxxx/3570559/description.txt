Reencarnacion-Punk as fuck Colombian Black Metal from 1988

Also inh my album spotlight tonight I\'ll be playing the 1979 Wreckless Eric album \"Whole Wide World\".

Actually it\'s not a proper album at all but a combination of tracks from his first two albums. I picked up a copy of this at \"Noise annoys\" in Toronto this past summer, because I\'ve been semi obsessed with the tile track for years.
I first heard it by German punkers Die Toten Hosen(joined by Eric himself) on their cover album \"Learning English\".
The song stands out as one of the best Pop Punk songs ever written.
When I saw the record I had to have it, and the whole thing holds together really well.
Eric was one of the original Stiff records guys(Along with Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe, and Ian Dury), and released three records with them between 78-80. He writes catchy little pop songs, but his sneering vocal delivery gives them a rough edge.
He\'s criminally under rated, and is just waiting for rediscovery.
If you like the Power Pop end of the Punk spectrum (think Buzzcocks, or early Joe Jackson) you should definitely check this shit out.
Apparently the song Whole Wide World is featured in the new movie \"Stranger than fiction\", so a revival might be just around the corner.
