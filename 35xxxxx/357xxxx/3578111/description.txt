Investigative journalist uncovers truth to the rumors about CIA drug operations in Mena, Arkansas during the Clinton governership and presidency (not to imply that Bush Sr. -who was fmr head of CIA- was not the operations commander). This documentary never was aired to my knowledge, it was recorded from a hacked satellite tuned to an \"edit\" channel which was feeding coast to coast \"preview programming\" to network executives in NYC. Apparantly the decision was made against running this program due to its content and the \"heat\" that it would generate. The CIA poses as FBI more often than not, so perhaps the \"FBI\" stated this would interfere with thier investigation... (if you get my drift)
