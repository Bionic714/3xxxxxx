,gregersamsa,2006-12-18T12:40Z,"And of course, this is from season FIVE (5) nothing else. Why Family Guy and American dad always has the wrong listing is beyond me. The correct code is: s05e08. Go figure...

When in doubt, check out http://epguides.com/familyguy/"

,F3LIIX,2006-12-20T21:10Z,"thankyou :) and everyone that keeps saying everything with calling in season 6 is so wrong we just say than to make it simple in the confusion + season four is missguided, in many torrents there is one episode missing and two are duplicates"

,Junx,2007-01-04T08:45Z,"Okay, that's it, where the hell is the LOL PROPER?  There's a fucking popup in this encode, and the [probably] deinterlacing looks like utter shit.  I mean, come on, what the hell.  I know XOR wasn't gaining much of a reputation lately in season 5/6 (whichever you want to call it), but come on, there's a reason all the propers are released after you guys fuck it up."
[T],Tedsharer,2007-01-05T05:23Z,"The scene are well aware of their mislabeling on Family Guy, but it would create lots of confusion if they went back to call this S05. Xor have tried relabeling but then their release got nuked. 

And there's no proper on this rls."
