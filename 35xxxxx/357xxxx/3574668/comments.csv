,oldngrey,2007-10-17T18:11Z,"This film would make a great prestiage if it would tell you the truth about global warming , it's quick flashing scenes and ill begotten music gave me a sense of forboding and doesn't not help to convey a sense of workable energy alternatives, this film made me feel helpless and depresssed. Much of the film is with Al Gore without anyone really backing up his views , it is like a big ego trip.My conclusion is if you want a pure disaster horror film then this is the one for you, but if you want a unbiased view of global temprature change then look to the bbc horizion documentary about global climate change. the nobelprice has lost all of his meaning and prestige since Al Gore got his. If anyone believes that humans causes global warming is either ignorant or having an agenda. Al Gore does have an agenda, look at his new company which buys and sells carbon credits, instant money for nothing.The ""Greener"" religion just doesn't standup to Scientific facts. Al Gore would sell his mother for a little feel good publicity. Alfred Nobel is probably rolling in his grave over what the Nobel prize become. The Nobel Peace Prize had lost it prestige long ago when it was given to Arafat, the father of modern terrorism.

The nine alleged errors in the film
# Mr Gore claims that a sea-level rise of up to 20 feet would be caused by melting of either West Antarctica or Greenland ""in the near future"". The judge said: ""This is distinctly alarmist and part of Mr Gore's ""wake-up call"". He agreed that if Greenland melted it would release this amount of water - ""but only after, and over, millennia"".""The Armageddon scenario he predicts, insofar as it suggests that sea level rises of seven metres might occur in the immediate future, is not in line with the scientific consensus.""

# The film claims that low-lying inhabited Pacific atolls ""are being inundated because of anthropogenic global warming"" but the judge ruled there was no evidence of any evacuation having yet happened.

# The documentary speaks of global warming ""shutting down the Ocean Conveyor"" - the process by which the Gulf Stream is carried over the North Atlantic to western Europe. Citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the judge said that it was ""very unlikely"" that the Ocean Conveyor, also known as the Meridional Overturning Circulation, would shut down in the future, though it might slow down.

# Mr Gore claims that two graphs, one plotting a rise in C02 and the other the rise in temperature over a period of 650,000 years, showed ""an exact fit"". The judge said that, although there was general scientific agreement that there was a connection, ""the two graphs do not establish what Mr Gore asserts"".

# Mr Gore says the disappearance of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro was directly attributable to global warming, but the judge ruled that it scientists have not established that the recession of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro is primarily attributable to human-induced climate change.

# The film contends that the drying up of Lake Chad is a prime example of a catastrophic result of global warming but the judge said there was insufficient evidence, and that ""it is apparently considered to be far more likely to result from other factors, such as population increase and over-grazing, and regional climate variability.""

# Mr Gore blames Hurricane Katrina and the consequent devastation in New Orleans on global warming, but the judge ruled there was ""insufficient evidence to show that"".

# Mr Gore cites a scientific study that shows, for the first time, that polar bears were being found after drowning from ""swimming long distances - up to 60 miles - to find the ice"" The judge said: ""The only scientific study that either side before me can find is one which indicates that four polar bears have recently been found drowned because of a storm.""That was not to say there might not in future be drowning-related deaths of bears if the trend of regression of pack ice continued - ""but it plainly does not support Mr Gore's description"".

# Mr Gore said that coral "

,perikorama,2007-12-19T01:48Z,"Det finns en gräns för när det inte längre är värt att ladda ner film. Det är är när ett eller flera av följande uppfylls:

1. Man blir blåst på innehållet och laddar ner något shit som inte alls är vad man vill ha.

2. Kvaliten är värdelös.

3. Man måste böka med undertexter, så det hela tar tusen år om man vill ha en fungerande.

Jag börjar bli trött på allt det här krånglet och betalar motvilligt till de enorma jättarna bakom filmerna för att slippa konstatera att jag inte kan spela en fil.

I det här fallet handlar det om att jag inte hör något ljud alls. Jag skiter i anledningen, för jag tänker inte ladda ner några nördiga tilläggsprogram eller vad det nu handlar om. Filmen ska väl för fan bara fungera i senaste Windows Media-playern, annars har någon varit jävligt kass på att rippa och lägga upp en film?

Den här filmen är i övrigt i god kvalitet, men saknar undertexter, för den som vill ha, och saknar som sagt LJUD!

Rakt i papperskorgen. Sen går jag och köper skiten."
,xxxjohnxxx,2008-01-13T08:58Z,"Ja!! Precis!! För jag tänker inte installera något program! Om jag inte har Office installerat på min dator, och någon skickar mig ett Worddokument, så tänker jag fan inet installera något nördigt program! Då går jag och köper ett papper av den personen istället!

Fatta det!"

,Mimimae,2008-10-12T19:27Z,"No, ""oldngrey"", you are not the only one (who believes in whatever he wants), but you are one of very, very few, and increasingly fewer, who still finds it meaningful to challenge the major thesis or the film, namely that we are seriously contributing to global warming by filling the atmosphere with carbon dioxide.
And frankly, I would buy stuff from you company too, if you had scientific decency to mention that the same judge you are so keen of quoting concluded that the major thesis of the film stands and that it is suitable for the in class, school education, if completed with more less dramatical and more scientific evidence. Look at this (and yes, I do make it possible to check my sources in full):

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/11/AR2007101102134.html 
High Court Judge Michael Burton, deciding a lawsuit that questioned the film's suitability for showing in British classrooms, said Wednesday that the movie builds a ""powerful"" case that global warming is caused by humans and that urgent means are needed to counter it.

*****************'
And ""oldngrey"", remember that Gore's and Guggenheim's film is just an informative/propaganda film, for something that really needs propaganda, for it has been oversighted for too long, and as such, a damn good one film, too."
,Torx8,2010-08-14T17:37Z,"""The First Global Revolution"" (1991) published by the Club of Rome:

â€œIt would seem that humans need a common motivation, namely a common adversary, to organize and act together in the vacuum; such a motivation must be found to bring the divided nations together to face an outside enemy, either a real one or else one invented for the purpose.

New enemies therefore have to be identified.
New strategies imagined, new weapons devised.

The common enemy of humanity is man.

In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome. The real enemy then, is humanity itself.""
