A very nice and intelligent, contiguous story of the incarnations Of Immortality
(Death, Time, Fate, War, Nature, Satan and God), all mortal persons holding an immortal office. 
I liked the series very much and therefor, am sharing it for about a month. After that it will be up to those who DL it to keep seeding.

Enjoy!
