,Telcopro,2006-12-14T01:03Z,"Thank you! I read this in my teens and really appreciated it then - it'll be interesting to see how it stands the test of time.

I'll seed to at least 3.0 if I get all of it."

,bzerc,2007-12-23T16:59Z,You have to use Quicktime Player to listen to these books mpb4 is the encoding type used for ipods and quicktime. i used Tunebite software and converted them to MP3 to use on other players hope this helps
