This week-end my old and dear friend Lara Croft stopped by and left me with a little Gem. An ARCHIVE long thought lost in the annuls of flight-sim mythology. Here my friends I present to you a piece of historical significance by the esteemed but extremely reclusive photo re-constructionalist himself...... Raimondo Taburet. 

Below you will find is the ONLY ..(search you muthers if you must)..  mention of this sadly forgotten and long abandoned masterpiece....

....from what has been written....this is the Lost City of Chicago memorialized in all of it's glory...sitting in splendor on the western shore of Lake Michigan (which from the air has the shape of a very limp dick) in that grand country - the U.S. of A. Now you will once more be able to cruise the windy skies of this glorious city......going in never-ending circles around that great black Phallic symbol in the middle of town erected by I am told....Mr Sears himself. As an added extra for those that fly very lowwwwww.....and fly very...very slowwwww, the south side features a veritable plethura of not to be missed ?muggings - rapes - robberies - gangland shootings and arsons that have never before been captured in a flight-sim till now.
