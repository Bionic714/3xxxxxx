Justflight Tiger Moth
Thanks"
,blankbox,2006-12-10T20:25Z,aahhh..Herr Doctor....very good question. From what I've been able to find....our friend Raimondo made some kind of deal with Flytampa or Simflyer about the time Midway was released....rest is history. Also....Horizon Sim - Justflight also released ChicagoVFR in the megascenery series...think all these suckers are in cahoots....and the only ones chasin the cat are us...the buyers !!!

,Dr. Frikadel,2006-12-11T00:06Z,"Aha Blackbox danke for explaining. Aber Mensch I installed it and it looked kinda horrible but very retro ;) LOL I'll keep it! Just for the fun. Compare this photoscenery with the possibilities of FSX and we've come a long way!

Also gute Nacht mein Liebchen,
Dr. Frikadel"
