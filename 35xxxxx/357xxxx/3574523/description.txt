The Most Awesome Rock Opera Ever, 1 November 2006

Author: Victoria Cunningham from United States


Although technically not an Opera, (as there are speaking parts) this was by far the best rock story since Tommy. The music is inspiring, the lyrics tell a great story and it should be made into a full length film. The story is twisted and really makes you think about society as a whole. The characters are all in themselves compelling and draw you in, weather you want them to or not. It is very easy to relate to any of them. Just the fact that you know this has or could go on somewhere is disturbing. The drugs used as a mind control and the things they do to to Nikki are sick. From the moment I saw it I wanted it.
