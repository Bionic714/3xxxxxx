,fnandango,2007-01-13T22:55Z,Yes Guys! It works really well!
,avseq,2007-01-14T12:46Z,"I downloaded it myself , and it really works 100% !!!! Also there's a keygen included . Works brilliant on my Windows XP based PC , can't understand why it's categorized as ""Other OS"" .
Enjoy !!"
,stamus contrama,2007-01-17T16:21Z,"What's up with the activation on this? It doesnt seem to need activation. The help menu defaults to a registration link instead of an activation link. I only ask since a keygen was included. 

I changed my system date and time to see if  tripped the 30 day trial mechanism but the software continued to work as normal.

Anyone else seen this?

Works great otherwise."

,XweAponX,2008-02-26T20:18Z,"There used to be a ""Macromedia Super CD"" that had ALL this stuff... Is this it? Someone pieced it together from good rips, made even an Autorun installer that inserted the SNs into each install."
