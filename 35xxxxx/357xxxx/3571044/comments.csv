,whomanflesh,2010-02-28T20:16Z,whats Securom_Loader 1.2 ? and whats a DT4?
,whomanflesh,2010-02-28T20:47Z,"1. copy launcher.exe and pr0tst0p.exe to your hd, 
   use a folder different from the game folder

2. create shortcut to launcher.exe on desktop, then
   r-click shortcut, select 
   in the target field append < -r ""titan quest.exe"">

   example: C:\Games\launcher.exe -r ""titan quest.exe""

   then enter your game folder in the second field

   example: ""C:\Games\Titan Quest""

   Now we have a shortcut that launches the renamed 
   asr 1.2 inside the game folder from a different 
   location. you can rename it to something else and
   give it another icon (maybe the game icon?)

3. use explorer to find the  file 
   inside your game folder. r-click, select .
   choose , set to .

4. run pr0tst0p, click 

5. run game via desktop icon


this is the only way i got titan quest 1.1 running 
from image with daemon tools 4.03.

I DONT GET IT D:"
,whomanflesh,2010-02-28T21:32Z,"why isnt it working! it tells me
please insert orignal titan quest disc 1 into drive E
where as my virtual drive that has titan quest mounted is F

HELP ME PLZ.

,steviekeyz,2010-07-06T23:22Z,"1.) Install Game

2.) Update to 1.30 (Latest Patch)

3.) Boot game from Daemon Tools/Magic Disc

Either Virtual Drive will run it fine, No crack required."
