,libben,2006-12-10T12:32Z,"Enjoy! Please seed this one for a while.

Been a real pain to find them all and get the working versions."
,libben,2006-12-10T13:13Z,"My upload is ~800 kb/sec

Enjoy."
,caruso2006,2006-12-10T14:09Z,"Thanks a lot.

ONE question: where can I find the base program (I figure it's relflight 3.5)?"
,libben,2006-12-10T19:10Z,"I saw it here earlier, try search. 

3.5 is an update that you do thru the simulator.

So you only need to hunt Realflight G3

And then update it.

You should be aware of that this is an simulator for ppl that fly these things irl. And when you buy this it comes with a remote dummy.

you can also buy a expensive remote and buy a cable and play.

Anyhow, keyboard works also,. But its not the way you should use this simulator. "
,libben,2006-12-10T19:30Z,"Sorry friends... ive been uploading 20 gb since the last 7 hours..


Ive now hooked it with superseed, so it should go faster for us all now.

Keep hanging on it."
,libben,2006-12-10T21:42Z,"Well, i have superseed it for a while now.

I have around 5.8 available in my client. So ill stop for now and reseed in 2-3 hours. But you will still get it from everyone else."
,hambone1,2006-12-12T02:51Z,"Thanks alot bud, this is great. Had a little trouble with expansion1.
Can anyone put up the patch for the no cd problem?
Or where I could find it?
Thanks"
,libben,2006-12-12T11:43Z,"hambone1:

No cd? You mean no cd patch for Realflight G3?

If thats the case, I dont have a clue. check DC

or google realflight nocd+torrent
"
,libben,2006-12-12T11:45Z,"Or burn the game and use a physical CD ;) when it ask for it.
"
,libben,2006-12-13T21:35Z,"Im not at home right now, but anyone want this to bo seeded some more?

Or is the numbers true that tpb is giving about seeders and leechers?"

,harry250,2007-02-18T06:28Z,"Try the Ripmax Rc Joystick interface

Works with my 

Hitec Focus 4 
and 
JR x310 S  Computer set

Ripmax Rc joystick interface will configure any rc Tx box as a 4 - 9 Channel
Joystick

Got mine a few years ago for 20 pounds

Probably less these days

You can then use the Emu dongle emulator and hunt for you new joystick channels

By Running real flight G3 Channel Mapping

and see which channels move when you select them

Hope this helps"

,libben,2007-03-04T21:32Z,"Still uploading ;) 


Im on 145 gb+

Well, im doing initial seeding time from time to really max it out for everybody."
,libben,2007-03-04T21:35Z,"Harry250, can't you update the game thru the game itself? Or doesnt that work on a backedup game?"
,harry250,2007-03-05T03:41Z,"I did try though the Real Flight G3.5 Loader

But it didnt work, i think it recognised the Serial Numbers "
,libben,2007-03-05T10:11Z,"Sorry to hear. Gonna look into it when I get home later then. it gonna be 8h aprox before I get home.

I dont remember if u get att a exe file in directory for updating. Hopefully, but dont think so. Going to check for something anyway.
"
,libben,2007-03-05T11:11Z,"For all ppl that seed, please enable initial-seeding AKA superseeding. So that u will seed bits that others doesnt have. That way we get more availability.

So please enable superseeding after you downloaded it."
,harry250,2007-03-06T08:31Z,"Also I dont think the Ripmax Interface is available anymore ?? 

but try this Rc Joystick interface instead

http://www.rc-electronics.co.uk

Looks very similar to the Ripmax One"
,harry250,2007-03-06T08:37Z,"NB

Dont worry about the Compatibility List and G3 Not included here:

http://www.rc-electronics.co.uk 

Were using the the Emu.exe Crack Remember

Wich cancels this out

Also you should be ok to use this interface for the Cracked Aeroflypro delux Rc sim

Which i got from Edonky network"
,libben,2007-04-03T13:52Z,"Well, 500 gb is enough from me. Im happy that it managed 1000 downloads =) Glad I could help."
,thipitz,2007-04-16T23:27Z,"hey, the add-ons you have, is that for realflight g3 or g2??:)"
