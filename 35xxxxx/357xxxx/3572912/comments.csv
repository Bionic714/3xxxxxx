AND DONT BE SILLY, WE ARE NOT MICROSOFT,GOOGLE or YAHOO that hackers will CREATE a fresh trojan for us and try it on us.WE CAN AFFORD 25-30 DAYS OLD DATABASE.

Version 5 entrenched Mr.K?s reputation, thanks to people like us, and was very good value from an honourable company.   But, it will die quicker than we might think, thanks to his new army of accountants.  Version 6, driven by those accountants, is faster, but that is sadly because it is going down hill, no joke.  It simply is not worth the money, discounts or not.

It is most likely that the money-men will produce disgruntled coders who, in turn, will break away and produce the quality product we are looking for."
,uffe6,2006-12-13T16:47Z,"You have to update Black.lst in order to get the update to work, and when tou do that you get blacklisted. If someone could crack the Black.lst file and remove those keys that are blacklisted in the file I would be happy :-) "
,tortus,2006-12-14T07:11Z,"You would be *happy* for about 5 minutes ? then what?  

The simple answer is to Pay or, switch to a Free AV.  To my surprise, the latest version of Grisoft AVG looks and works very much like KAV5 and feels better, to me, than KAV6, not to mention the price factor.  Avast is also quite usable and equally well rated.

http://www.virus.gr/english/fullxml/default.asp?id=72&mnu=72

Both of these AVs would suite 90% of home users, 100% of the time, and 100% of home users 99% of the time.  Just add a good Firewall (not MS) and other AntiBastardry software (not MS) and you are as safe as you will ever be ? provided you update EVERYthing regularly.  It is my preference to do this ?on demand? at my call, rather than rely on automated schedules, especially when it comes to the OS.

When Mr.K realises his recent mistake, he may well introduce his own Free Product to try and regain some respectability.  That's if he hasn't fallen victim to his accountants as Mr.G has, in which case, we may see another -seemingly- graceful withdrawal, sometime down the track.

For those who didn?t find the page for current ratings, here it is.

There is something on the current page that should stir a few brains into action. 
Pardon the pun.  This will become clear when you look.

If not, have a second look.

If your brain doesn?t work at all, then you probably haven?t read this far anyway, but if in doubt, have a third look.

Surely I don?t have to spell it out.  Google, and the screen shot also has a clue.

When the penny drops, there are some things that I?ve found that may be off-putting to some, at first.

During the procedure for DL (which is for everybody ? no distinction) off course you have to give an email address (reply is slow ? any wonder) and you will see a *certificate out of date* warning (accept it).  You will be presented with a button to *Start Installation* but the next box lets you Save the MSI instead.  MSI, what a coincidence!  The current build of this DL, as of now, is 308, not 411.

Damn, I think I?ve just given the game away.

I have confirmed that everything is OK in the code and legit with all systems go.
I hasten to add that I haven?t had time to install it yet.

This is too damn good to be true and I do wonder about the partnership.

Manual updates is a tad of an inconvenience compared to what Kaspersky does for you..

I must say a huge improvement over what I was using before which was ZoneAlarm..  I scanned my system after installing Kaspersky and it found 30 dangerous files (trojans, exploits, backdoors, etc) that slipped through ZoneAlarm.. Pretty alarming I must say, so Im way glad I checked Kaspersky out.. Seems Im going to keep this one for a while.."

1) Its free but your going to be subjected to SPAM mail because you register your email address ith AOL.. I wouldnt be surprised if AOL actually periodically checks to see if you have a valid email, in case you decide to register a fake email address..

2) Unlike Kaspersky 5, you need to uninstall your current firewall in order to use the AV.. I like ZoneAlarms firewall so why should I get rid of it just so I can use an AV program?

Im going to stick with KAV5 cause it works and it does so very well with no problems.."
,tortus,2006-12-20T04:26Z,"Thanks for that, Hyp____
But the truth is, at the risk of sounding like a nark, you are quite correct.  There are drawbacks, but they all come under the heading *Nothing's Perfect*.

Re Item 1) 
It doesn't apply.  To get your personal Lic a bogus address is usless.  If you look, you can find some very clever little tricks to channel through this one off email - no spam.

Re Item 2)
Kasper blacklisted (almost) all pirated keys, both AV and his AntiHacker.  Unfortunately there was also a crack for KAH, so to defeat that, he put a fix in KAV6.  KIS doesn't need it because AH is bundled in KIS.  Kasper wouldn't give two hoots if your using a pirated ZA.  If ZA is reported as incompatable (not surprisingly) it would in fact not be compatable.

In time, if you have any respect for your PC, you WILL learn to keep ALL products from CA (and norton) well away from your box.

Don't make wild assumptions - try things.  BUT LOOK *HARD* BEFORE YOU LEAP.

(I wondered if the aol Lic would produce a *transferable* KEY file - it doesn't).

But wait - there's more.
There may be some crap in 12 months when the aol Lic expires.  Who knows???"

,tortus,2006-12-21T03:26Z,"If you actually saw a message stating that ZA was not compatible with KAV, then that is the fact, and just ONE of the MANY inconsistencies with all products released by Computer Assosiates, which will ALWAYS be the case because that company, the same with Symantec, has absolutely no respect for the end user and his/her systems.  You will find this out in time, but it is a long and painful process, of which I am trying to help you avoid.  It's very easy to judge things by what you see on the surface, and that's what these companies rely on - peoples laziness.  The shortcomings are far too numerous and variable for anybody to define, often related to the users performance, but again this an example of the companies disrespect.  Anybody (unfortunately many) who argue otherwise surely only entrench their inexperience, but they will eventually begin to doubt themselves and realize that *what we know now is going to be totally insignificant next week*.

You could well be right.  We'll see in time.
Kaspersky already did himself a grave injustice when he *shut us out* after we were largely responsible for his rise to fame.

___Hypnosis4U2NV___
It pays to keep up-to-date with these sites with the way things keep seesawing through time.

The one thing we can bank on staying pretty much constant, is those compaines that assume that the mass, mother of all conglomerates. the you's and me's, are a bunch of easily controllable mindless sheep.  Does SONY come to mind.  The likes of,  MS, AOL, Computer Associates, Symantec, etc., will never learn, and if they did, they can't shake their history.
I think that AOL is using Kaspersky to attempt just that, but they will only attract the gullible, as far as their other services are concerned, which in turn will eventually add to their list of bad credits.  But that dosn't matter to them.  It's what slips through their coffers in the meantime is their only interest as there will always be an endless supply of new chums.
