NOTE          NOTE                 NOTE           NOTE

Kaspersky blacklisted several keys in recent times. I have included the key that will work till nov 2007. So, dont worry. install as Directed by me.You will not be blacklisted.

How to Install:

well, thats a good Question. But I have an answer!

just uninstall the previous version if you have any. After Uninstall, restart your computer. now delete 'kaspersky lab' folder from C:\program files.

Search 'Kaspersky' in c: and delete if any file found.

Now:

1. Just run the setup file and when prompted, add the key from key         folder.

2. Reastart the computer after Install.

3. Turn off your internet connection for sometime. If any dialog box appears for update, then cancel it. DO NOT UPDATE KASPERSKEY NOW.

4. Now open kaspersky anti-virus. go to settings tab.

5. Now click on configure updater.

6. Uncheck 'update application modules'.

7. Uncheck 'Enable scheduled updates'.

8. In same window go to 'Update servers' tab.

9. Uncheck 'kaspersky lab's update servers' option. And now, click on 
   'add' button. Select 'folder' option.

10. Select the 'av-i386&ids-cumul' folder from update folder from 		downloaded torrent folder. Click on select button. then click 		on ok button.

11. Now click on 'Protection' tab in main window.
    
12. look in right pane of the window. Click on 'Update antivirus     	database now'. Its a hyperlink. it will update from local 		folder,not from internet.

     You can run your internet connection now.


     Congrats, You are safe now.

NOTE:

1. Kaspersky 6.0 And above does not Support Manual Updates. So please   be Happy with this version as i am. ITS A GOOD VERSION,REALLY>

Actually, I think that it is not the version that counts, but it is the database that is valuable. I am a Broadband User and i Dont have a single virus in my PC with KASPERSKY. DO NOT RUN AFTER LATEST VERSIONS.THEY CAN STOP FUNCTIONING IF YOU UPDATE THEM. AND IF YOU DO NOT UPDATE, YOU ARE NOT MORE SAFE.

2. Its a 5.0.388 version. it can be updated manually.

To update:

1. go to www.kaspersky.com/avupdate.

2. In the Right pane, there is a Heading 'Automatic Updates'.
   There is a option for manual updating titled "5.0 products using zip archive". click on it.

4. If you have updated your Antivirus database yesterday, click on daily.zip. 

If you have updated your Antivirus database Last week, click on weekly.zip.

If you have updated your Antivirus database More than 10 days ago, click on Cumul.zip.

	Save it on your Hard Drive and use it as described above.After all, Now you know how to manually Update your AV database.

Never Enable auto update option in Kaspersky. you will be Blacklisted.

If You Already have Kaspersky 5.0 Series and blacklisted, then you dont need to download this torrent. just uninstall it as described, and follow steps 1 to 12. 


Enjoy!
