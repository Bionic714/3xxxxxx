,r4t,2006-12-07T07:19Z,dumbass if you want someone to download why dont you fucking seed instead of wasting everyones time 
,Crillie,2006-12-07T11:20Z,"lol idiots it has been seeded from start.


Thx IcySon55"
,IcySon55,2006-12-07T16:23Z,"Yes, I was seeding this from the beginning. Pirate Bay is just slow to update it's stats. Next time, actually START the torrent to check for seeds and don't rely on TPB stats.

And you're welcome Crillie."

,SpaceZvi,2006-12-08T17:32Z,"Will it run on XP?
and if so, will it be possible to play @ Lan?"
,ZellSF,2006-12-08T19:14Z,"No. It is not, it was made for WOL online. 

You can run it in XP and play a training game with the AI, which isn't very interesting."
,IcySon55,2006-12-09T07:33Z,"If you guys really want to play this online. You have to bug the admins of XWIS. It's the current host for all CnC online activity. Get a petition going for the addition of Sole Survivor support. I wish you luck.

,X_HuNTeR_X,2008-01-11T15:13Z,"I can be a Seeder in one month, but plz i need that 6%!!!"
,X_HuNTeR_X,2008-01-12T23:48Z,"Now i have 100% and i can Seed. Thnx
But know something, there is a .Iso in RapidShare that only takes 180MB and its THE SAME image. Only for advert ppl for dont wasting HD ;)"
,IcySon55,2008-01-25T08:08Z,"It's not the same image. This proper ISO is a Mixed Mode CD. It has the game data, and audio tracks you can listen to in any stereo/cd player.

The 180MB iso you're talking about is data only.

Note: I no longer have this image on my hard drives and will not be able to seed. Sorry."
,gti-r,2008-11-21T14:05Z,Hey thanks a lot man I loved this game back in the day. Will seed for life just cause I can:)
,KyleOnBoard,2009-06-22T20:02Z,"you gotta be shitting me, 3kb/s really? im downloading two other stuff at 300-400 kb/s why doesnt no one seed once they have downloaded? screw this shit, ill be waiting for about a month to wait for this to finish downloading."
,Tecness2,2011-05-29T08:19Z,"If anyone still has this, please seed. A few friends and I are trying to get this game as I type this but we need seeders."
