I own a fair amount of Glass, and this is a great way of figuring out what I should buy next (and saves me the effort of ripping my CDs to MP3 for the iPod)

Thanks again."
,eterman,2006-12-26T08:11Z,Glad to help.

I'll seed that instead; hope it helps at all."
,eterman,2007-01-13T18:41Z,"Yeah, if you enjoy the so called ""minimalist"" side of Glass, try some of the music of John Coolidge Adams: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3595388/A_John_Adams_Collection"
[T],naxosking,2007-01-23T08:06Z,"If you love Glass and the cello, check out these arrangements of some of his work done by the Cello Octet Conjunto Iberico. Pretty neat concept album:

,mlLK,2010-03-01T14:33Z,"Thank you for this magnanimous compilation of music by Philip Glass; if it wasn't for music like his and a torrent like this, it'd be unbearable for me to sit at my computer for hours on end writing code.

P.S. Dear Mr. Glass, I will re-pay you the debt of downloading this torrent soon enough. However, I have spent a significant sum on your albums as CDs, which were either lost, stolen, damaged, or altogether unplayable. This format is optimal for both preserving your work and ensuring your legacy as a composer. ;)"
