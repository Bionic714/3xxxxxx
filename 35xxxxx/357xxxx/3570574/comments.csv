,atomcoeur,2006-12-11T23:32Z,"has anybody managed to install this? It accepts the serials but then it tells me that it cannot install a license file because ""the user does not have enough privileges"".. then it installs, runs, re-asks for serial and says that the license file is corrupt and quits. I tried installing from root with the same problem so.. dunno"

,messedup22,2007-02-11T20:12Z,"Haven't DL'ed this yet, but I had the same License error message for FCP.  I found this comment on one of PB's pages and it worked for me:

""I found a burried suggestion on Apple's support site which did the trick. You have to go into the HD>Library>Application Support>ProApps folder and remove the 'FCP System ID' file. I don't know why it works, but it works... ""

Dunno if that might get you on the right track.  Let me know."
,nizick,2007-02-14T08:22Z,"After installing go to HD>Library>Application Support>ProApps folder and remove the 'FCP System ID' file

then enter D-342-GGJ-206-QGS-307-MOB-170-RXK-STQ

it works"

,mac_davis,2007-05-08T13:50Z,Have you tried switching it's card detection from AGP to PCI?
,daviestar,2007-05-20T16:51Z,"I have tried to download this torrent twice now, once I have downloaded 3.5GB it stops - giving me a I/O error.. anyone have any ideas?"
,mac_davis,2007-06-08T04:33Z,This is the best serial out there? for Motion 2.1 Volume/Floating license.
,seraph001,2007-07-13T19:21Z,"mac_davis:
could you let me know how to switch the card detection from agp to pci?  i'm sure it's something to do with opening the package contents and changing a parameter, but i haven't found anything online to let me know.
my e-mail is my handle at yahoo.
thanks."
,minikvick,2007-11-01T19:25Z,thx for the tip nizick! None of the serials worked until i did what you wrote

All I did was run Software Updater and it worked. It updated Motion and Compressor and now Final Cut AND Motion work! I'm so excited!

Compressor still doesn't work though :("
