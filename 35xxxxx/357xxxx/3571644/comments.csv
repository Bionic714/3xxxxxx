,orpat,2008-01-18T14:27Z,"Tackar, men hur bränner ni den här? Subsen med div andra filer ligger för sig när man packat upp. Hjälp !!!"

,Highlander009,2009-01-26T14:58Z,"Arrrrgghhhh!  The included English subs are the director's commentary, ffs!  Only the Scandanavian subs are of the film's dialogue!  However, if you join the two avi's together (best way is direct stream copying of both video and audio streams appended together in VirtualDub) then the subs at: http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/45753/cutthroat-island-en can be easily re-synched (using Ctrl+B [Adjust Subtitle Timings] in SubtitleWorkshop) to fit the movie.  I used 00:01:27,000 for the First Spoken Line and 01:52:56,000 for the Last and the result was fine! 

NB: Both the excellent pieces of software mentioned are freely available Freeware (just Google 'em) and then use AVIAddXSubs to write the srt file into the avi container so your DivX compatible player can turn the subs on/off at will! :)"
