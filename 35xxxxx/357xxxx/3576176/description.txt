The Devil's Footpath (60 min)

?Africa could be the best place on earth, but instead our best and brightest minds are leaving the continent in their millions.? So says June Arunga, a 22-year-old Kenyan law student who's facing the same dilemma. Should she stay or should she go?

To find an answer to that question, June embarked on a 5000-mile, six-week, soul-searching journey, travelling the length of Africa through Egypt, Sudan, Congo, Angola, Namibia and, finally, South Africa. Six conflict-riven countries that span the continent ? from Cairo to Cape Town ? and comprise 'The Devil?s Footpath'.

Aid agencies, UN peacekeepers and even multinationals fly June into some of the continent?s bleakest war zones ? meeting tribal chiefs, DJs, rappers, soldiers, miners, students, school kids and witch doctors. The journey is an emotional one, showing the very best and the very worst of Africa.

After six weeks June arrives in Cape Town ? angry at the continent?s leaders, proud of everyday Africans and very confused. Can Desmond Tutu, one of Africa?s most respected statesmen, help June decide whether there is a future for her in Africa?
