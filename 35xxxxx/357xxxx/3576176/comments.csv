,blademccool,2006-12-14T01:05Z,At present there are no seeds. I am sad because  this sounds soooo good.
,blademccool,2006-12-16T00:40Z,Thanks to the seeder. May he/she please keep seeding until some of us 20 peers who are all mostly at 60.4% (at the time of this writing) are able to complete the file. I'll surely keep seeding for a long while once the download completes.
,blademccool,2006-12-16T15:57Z,"Much progress, but please return Mr seeder so the 18 of us who are stuck at 98.6% can complete the transfer. We will be so grateful."
,blademccool,2006-12-16T18:19Z,Yayaya it finished! :) Thanks seeder.

The other one, ""Africa's ultimate resource"" appears to be correct by default."
