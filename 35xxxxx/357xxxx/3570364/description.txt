Here are over 40 albums of Indian Classical, Folk, and Fusion music mp3s.  Many of the albums I actually bought in India, some I purchased in the USA, and a few I downloaded a while ago.

If you like Indian Classical music, please type a search for another torrent I have posted ?L. Shankar?

PLEASE SEED TO A 1/1 RATIO! If everyone gives back what they take, a torrent should stay alive, right?  I intend to seed for as long as I can, with some vacations particularly in late Dec. 06, and early Jan. 07, so please have confidence even if it doesn?t come through right away.

I am still new at this so any suggestions will be appreciated!  Enjoy.
