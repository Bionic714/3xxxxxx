,Zendra,2010-06-16T00:06Z,"@Pizza_Hut
FLAC bullshit?? wtf! is wrong with you? If you dont understand why it's in FLAC don't download, you have the mp3 version on pirate bay, and if you already downloaded reencode it to mp3, because it's lossless format, so you can. And if you don't know how to do it, google it and LEARN man!!! Someone has recorded this from vinyl directly to flac and loose a lot of time (you know what vinyl is? and that means he had to wait the whole time the music is playing to recorded it, and then cut the beggining and the end, edit it or whatever the is he doing it, that's hard work), because he aprreciate this music and values the quality in sound, and now we can simply in few clicks download this and wait when it downloads and enjoy the music in great quality, and you small petty creature are only complaining for nothing, and you don't even spend any money for this and you still complain!? Respect the hard work of the author, if only there are more of them, and less of YOU. HUUUGE respect for the author, and don't upset yourself to much as i did about the comments, there are lots of people who appreciate your work, and are happy for FLAC format, thank you"

,BlockJuice,2010-11-09T00:42Z,"I'm more of an mp3 guy (Steve Jobs and his shitty iPods) but I still get FLACs if I can't find a 320kbps upload anywhere.

Thanks for the upload werdwerdus, really appreciate how you put all the artwork on there."
,c0nrad,2011-12-19T00:41Z,Brilliant torrent man ;)
,All4h,2012-01-08T04:13Z,"Thank you so much man! You have no idea how much I appreciate you taking the time to make such a comprehensive upload! And in FLAC?? You're my hero, man. I will seed until the day I die."
,phagotom,2012-03-23T07:33Z,"This is fucking amazing. I've been looking for a torrent of the analord series everywhere, and to find them all in one download, in FLAC!! It's too good to be true. Unfortunately, I'm stuck at about a 5 kb/s download speed so if anyone can seed this, please do! I will seed it too if I can get some help from you guys."
