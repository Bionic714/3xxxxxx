,RastaCruz,2007-01-01T23:17Z,"hey, i appreciate your willingness to share my recordings, but didn't you read this on my setlists ""* * * PRESERVE THE QUALITY, DO NOT ENCODE TO MP3 * * *""

i think that is pretty easy to understand, don't you?  please remove this torrent and share the original flac or shn files only!  thank you!"
,cultivator,2007-01-02T05:43Z,"I sure read that. However I'm not the one who encoded the recordings to mp3. Since I couldn't find the original files I thought these would do. Anyhow I prefere files that will play in iTunes. 

I suggest that you create a torrent with the original files if you think people would prefere that. As long as there is a demand for this torrent I can't see any reason to remove it.

Anyway, thanks for the great recordings and keep up the good work!"
,RastaCruz,2007-01-04T09:27Z,"hmm, you can't see any reason to remove it?  let's see i can give you a few of them:
1. PRESERVE THE QUALITY, DO NOT ENCODE TO MP3 (this also implies that you do not share in mp3 format either).
2. I asked you rather nicely to please remove the torrent which violates reason number 1.
3. you thank me for the great recordings and tell me to keep up the great work.  well, it's people like you who make tapers hoard shows.  you can't follow simple instructions, make excuses like ""I'm not the one who encoded the recordings to mp3"" and then basically give me the middle finger when i ask you to respect my wishes.  so, yes i have been and will indeed continue to keep up the great work.  but, i won't be releasing any more of my recordings to the masses to enjoy.  if you're a true groundation fan, you may have really enjoyed what i would have been sharing next.

,cultivator,2007-01-05T02:07Z,"I'm truly sorry for your aggressive reaction on sharing great music to the reggae massive, only because the music is encoded in what you think is a bad format. 

My opinion is however clear. I'm not responsible to the recorders of bootlegs nor the artists themselves (otherwise I wouldn't share material that's restricted by copyright laws). 
The reason for why I'm sharing is that I have a wish to make great music available for more people. To spread the message of the artists I'm sharing. It's a fact that there is no easy way to play .flac files in the OS I'm using, and don't you think that it would be too bad if such a thing as the file format would prevent people from taking part of such great music as this?

If you don't think so, I have to say that I think you are indeed elitist. Anyway my wish wasn't to upset you. I could only find .mp3 files of your recordnings, and even though a read you note I considered it my duty to share this great music.

Finally, I'm definitely not giving you ""the middle finger"". I respect you and I'm thankful for the recordings you have made. I'm sorry to hear that you no longer wish to share your recordnings however that's your decision to make and I respect that too. 

Bless!"
,RastaCruz,2007-01-05T19:28Z,"i certainly agree that this is great music and a great band that needs to be shared as much as possible.  that is why i started recording this band and spreading the recordings all over the world the past three years.  furthermore, i'm a very easy going guy, extremely generous, and rarely, if ever, get into arguments with people online.  however, you have to understand that it's frustrating to see the quality of my recordings degraded, and then when i ask them to be removed i don't get the kind of support i was expecting.  i guess i put my trust into others too much to be thoughtful and respectful of others.  i don't know what OS you're using, but as far as i know most have support for .shn and .flac.  i'm sure a google search will find you the software you need.

i know mp3's are extremely popular and are ""here to stay.""  however, it is not just me who believes that they are an inferior or bad format.  the fact is that the live music trading community has been around since the days of the grateful dead, long before the beginnings of the Internet and mp3 compression.  maintaining a recording's quality has always been the number one focus for people who traded these recordings.  so, it's not a rule, or idea that i'm just making up so to speak.  mp3's are simply not allowed in every community i know about that is dedicated to trading live music.  another thing that isn't allowed in these communities are official, copyrighted material.  if you're interested, here's the FAQ's of a few of these sites.  in each of them, you will see that mp3's or other lossy formats are not allowed.

,RastaCruz,2007-01-05T19:31Z,"(cont.) so, i do realize i can't control what happens to my recording once i put it out there to the masses.  it's just that i've been trading and sharing recordings for about ten years solely with people who understand the difference between lossless and lossy material.  so, maybe i'm not used to dealing with people who don't see the problems with lossy recordings.  

what does happen quite often though, is mp3 sourced recordings make their way back into the lossless community, and people who are expecting to get a lossless copy of a show end up getting the lossy mp3 version.  that is the type of thing we all try to avoid.  and, that is why i make the simple request of not converting my shows to mp3. "
,RastaCruz,2007-01-05T19:37Z,"(cont.) like i said, i appreciate your desire to share these wonderful recordings and am glad you enjoy them.  it's just unfortunate that we can't seem to agree on the mp3 issues.  bless!"
,rt3000,2007-07-20T16:56Z,"to RastaCruz,
i understand the concern with this medium; but i must say, without this torrent i would have never know about Groundation and their greatness. Groundation has become one of my favorite and since downloading this torrent and other Groundation torrents i have have been to see 2 of their concerts and bought their best of album (so far)."
,clementine1,2008-02-20T08:39Z,"Regarding the discussion, I can only say that I understand both parties. As much as I truly understand how painful it must be to see something you have created be distorted into something else, I do feel the ambition to share emancipating music with the masses to be a great cause. Flac is definitely the greater format, but it is unfortunately still not adapted by a majority of people. WeÂ´ll get there though, and when we do, the mp3-versions will disappear by themselves, as musicsharing de facto is selvcleansing when it comes to corrupt or inferior fileformats. Thanks for the great music!  "
