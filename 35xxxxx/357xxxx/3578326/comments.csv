Thx Man"
,PhilGrim,2006-12-26T04:29Z,Does this have audio commentary too? Two of the episodes on the DVD have this.
,mxrC,2006-12-26T14:14Z,"PhilGrim, these are just the episodes. 

No extras."
,PhilGrim,2006-12-26T15:43Z,Is it DVDRIP? The DVD has two commentaries that are the only reason to have the dvd. 
,mxrC,2006-12-26T22:06Z,"PhilGrim, we only ripped the episodes from the DVD, not the extra."
,PhilGrim,2006-12-28T02:20Z,"Yes but you could have ripped the extra audio track for the two chapters that had them. 

Any chance of a DVD ISO?"
,mxrC,2006-12-28T17:13Z,"If requested by enough, we will put up the DVDR."
,PhilGrim,2006-12-29T14:03Z,"what about the MP3 tracks for the two commentaries? Easy enough to mux in Vdub.

That would be awesome :D"
,rendezvous,2006-12-31T11:10Z,"Thanks much mate!

I'd love to have the commentaries too."
,mxrC,2007-01-01T22:33Z,"Commentaries are delayed untill further notice, our provider seems to have gone MIA.

If anybody have the commentaries, feel free to post."
