And for fucks sake stom naming Cam films anything else cause it's not. It ain't a RIP, TC or even a Previev its a CAM!  It's an entire saloon full with poeple (Russians often) Laughing, eating popcorn and holding hands. Perhaps someone gets their first kiss or maybe there's a guy in the back wacking off.
No one wants this, so please pirates of the world BANN THE CAM!"
,imizrahi,2006-12-12T02:54Z,"hey gospoken...make up your mind...is THAT your handle or 'no one'...

or stop speaking for me, please...
your generalizations, per usual, don't hold water...
there ARE worthwhile cam uploads...
the trick is to just d/l the sample and judge it on a d/l x d/l basis...
or not...
i have no intention of seeing an imperfect copy of this film, u/lr(coretorrents?), but thank you, just the same, for the attempt/time/energy..."
,gobsek,2006-12-14T00:33Z,Quality sucks!!!
,ticktock_man,2006-12-14T16:19Z,why is this labeled as a screener?
,zcorvine9,2006-12-17T08:24Z,"Thank you.  The CAM's video quality is bad but barely watchable.  Recommended if you wish to at least join the story.  Comes CAM'd with English and Spanish SUBS.  

Stay away from the following:
Apocalypto.CAM.XviD-ReCode
At just past 1HR 19MIN into the movie, it restarts in the beginning again."
,zcorvine9,2006-12-17T08:25Z,*Recommended if you wish to at least enjoy the story.
