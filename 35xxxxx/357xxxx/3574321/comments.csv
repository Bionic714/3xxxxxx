A DVD is at least 4 Gb, or double the size if in HDTV format. And here comes a file thath is 700 Mb, which is about 1/6th of the size.

Conclusions anyone?

This is definietly not a DVD rip. At best it may be a version that has been compressed with some lousy codec and with the high quality sound removed as well as potential extras, menu's etc from the DVD.

Then also remember thtat it was not to long since the movie was on the cinemas, so is the DVD even released yet? If not, then at best this is yet another lousy screener.

Well, you may share this fake low quality shit, there is always some looser wanting to download crap. But do not try to be smart by pretending it is something it is not. We are not stupid but we do punish idiots.

And by the way, you stupid comments that it is not a fake is sooo tooo much, it just confirms that you know that you  are lying. Why else care and defend yourself so much and so badly..."

3. Why don't you just download it and see for yourself that you in fact are a idiot (and a son of a bitch for complaining without knowing shit) because this is neither a fake nor in crappy quality.... 

To sum it all up: All you complaining guys, GO FUCK YOURSELVES!! And if u really got to complain do so after u have downloaded it and don't just asume that it's a fake, because again: IT'S NOT!"
,poijk,2006-12-10T20:07Z,"Ok, I'll be nice and will try to teach you (The_Jackal) something that you obviiously do not know.

""1. RIP kinda means compressed to avi.... otherwise it would be a DVDR...""

Starting to make your own definitions?

Ripping a DVD means that you bypass the copyprotection and creates and exact copy of the disc. Ever started to think what the R means in DVDR? It stansds for Rip. I doubt that your ignorance will trust me, so here a link to a trusted source for you to start read:

http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=ripping&i=50547,00.asp

More over, avi is not any compression or codec, it is just a file storage format. An avi file can contain any compression inside. You can compare with the tiff format for images where the tiff format is also just a placeholder and not a compression format.

I guess that you would think that the file has been encoded with a DivX or similar codec to shirin the size, but then again, which you obviously do not  know, this affects both imagequality but also most codecs does not support surround sound.


""2. RIP's of movies are usually 700MB or 1,3GB...""

Wrong again. A RIP is exactly the same size as the original. A RIP is untouched. However it is common that a file is encoded to be in the size of /== Mb to fit a CD, but depending on the codec used the quality can vary quite a lot.


""3. Why don't you just download it""

I thought I commented that in previous post. I am not intereseted in crap and especially not fake crap. Only people spreading fakes needs to try to convince that it is not fake crap, the rest of us can be trusted.


""GO FUCK YOURSELVES!!""

What a noce and wonderful language. Suddenly I think I start to trust you...NOT! Behave."

Did you ever bother about reading what I wrote? Here are many DivX encoded (and other codecs used), which are good. But they do not pretend to be DVD rips. Simply because they are not.


""the piratebay should change it's system for organizing the torrents, because all the movies should be put in the same category, no need for the ""DVDR"" category where all the images for DVDR's are put.... right again poijk?""

What is wrong with your reading? Or are you trying to pretend to be more stupid than you are?

Rips are posted in the DVDR section and are same size as its originals. Rips are not encoded to be smaller or changed in any other way.

If not a RIP then there are other areas to be used. I do not see a problem with this, as long as stupid poeple refuse to understand this system and are spreading fakes.

Again, I would urge you to behave and watch your mouth but also read what you are commenting before you start bluddering. Now we have not only revealed your fake rip, but also learned that you easily make a fool of yourself by these embarrings comments. Please let it end here or do you need to completely humiliate yourself?"
,compccs,2006-12-10T20:42Z,"this is hilarious... how one topic can blow up to people flamming people for what they said... grow up people... and yes this is just a r5 rip very similar to a tc... if everyone is too lazy to look it up a r5 is region 5 meaning russia where they release a dvd as fast as they can to compete with piracy... these in turn can then be ""ripped"" to a avi or mpg or whatever for everyone else to watch... so no this isnt completely a dvd rip but its not a fake persay.....and now im sure ill be flammed for whatever stupid ass reason someone can come up with... anywho have a good day (..)"
,Tha_Jackal,2006-12-10T20:44Z,"""Rips are posted in the DVDR section and are same size as its originals. Rips are not encoded to be smaller or changed in any other way.""

oh really? why don't you look at the names of the files in the top100/movies section and then look at their size... Is it just me or are there a lot of filenames containg dvd-rip even though their size is 700 MB..?

Let me say it like this: picture-quality is 10 of 10!

oh, and about this whole r5-thing: did i miss something, doesn't r5 mean that it's a region 5 dvd? what's the difference between a region 5 dvd and a region 1or 2 dvd regarding the quality?  "
,Bardal,2006-12-11T00:01Z,"poijk:

If you have been downloading movies off any torrentsite, you'd know that a DVDRip means that its compressed to a much smaller size, normally from about 650-1,4gb.

and DVDR means its the whole DVD ripped, not just the movie in a compressed format.

Every TPB-Fan should know this really.

Anyhow, from the comments I have read, this is not the DVDRip, but a _good_ screener.
I'm gonna download anyways.

,smithjohn57,2006-12-11T00:20Z,"Description of a R5 by PUKKA:
Over the past 6 months the major movie studios have been releasing retail dvds early in Russia.  They do this to stop the widespread use of pirated telecines (which were once very common).  R5 retail is rushed out by the studio, they are basically competing with pirates, so there is little to no cleanup of the film after the telecine process.  So the main difference between telecines put out by the pirates is that the r5's are done using pro equipment, professional studios and professional people.  The quality of R5 retail is very similar to dvdscr's, no time is usually spent cleaning up dvdscrs either. "

1) Regarding the quality, this movie defenitely COULD BE a DVDRip (but most likely it's a Telecine). BTW, a DVDRip means that the SOURCE from where the movie was ripped was a DVD. If the movie was compressed/encoded in the ripping process doesn't matter.
2) This is most probably the Pekka release from Eastern Europe/Russia (therefore R5 = Region 5).
3) The corrupted 8 or 9 minutes at the end have been fixed by Pekka in a newer release.
4) The term NO FAKE should be avoided in a torrent title at all costs.
5) For somebody upping his first torrent this sure is nicely done. Thanks Jackal.

Case closed."
,ticktock_man,2006-12-14T20:51Z,"this is nicely done?
1. he renamed the PUKKA release and took credit for it himself.
2. hes been running his foul little 12-year old mouth for 4 pages now. 
3. the torrent is mislabelled.

the scene could do without little shit nuggets like this one. there is a reason people like aXXo have been around so long and have built up such a reputation -- they consistently upload quality releases with accurate information that they encoded themselves as opposed to stealing them from another group/individual. 

as for 'Tha_Jackal', nothings going to happen to him here... but sooner or later hell run his little faggot mouth off to the wrong person in the real world and hell be picking his teeth up off the pavement with broken fingers."
,Tha_Jackal,2006-12-14T21:22Z,"Oh yeah right....

Because you don't know me, I don't really care what you're saying, but let me tell you this much: So far, I haven't been the one that had to ""pick my teeth up off the pavement""... Seriously, don't talk like that without knowing who you're talking to.

Second: Since you clearly are very selective in what you read in the comments and what you just ""miss"" you really just should stay out of this, but i'll say it again for your down-syndrome-ass:

 I downloaded the file with the nametag it has (except for ""No Fake"") with dc++, I didn't know that it was a renamed pukka-release.

I'm not gonna just sit here and take shit from anybody, because it wasn't me, who renamed the damn file! 

Anyway: Since i posted the file (with the name it now has) here it has been downloaded 803 times and i haven't heard any complaining from anyone, that actually downloaded the file and it's the most popular borat-torrent on the pirate bay with 2000 people downloading it right now and about 1000 people seeding it, this is much more than the, correctly named, pukka release has reached. My explanation to that is, that most people didn't know that the r5-release actually was almost as good as any dvdrip-release, and therefor didn't download it. The release i put up (which i have never claimed as my own by the way) has a nametag containing dvd-rip, the people therefor know that it's good quality and download it and are obviously very happy about it.

So really I don't know what you're fuckin' problem is, because again: 

I didn't rename it, have never claimed it as my own release and people downloading it are satisfied.

O.K. for the real definition.

DVD-Rip = means a file has been extracted from a dvd. It does NOT mean that it has to be the same size. It can go through any type of codec compression and still be a dvd-rip

DVDR = a dvd rip that has not undergone any codec compression  the R does NOT stand for rip, it stand for Recordable (this means that a dvdr is a rip that is sized for either a dvd-r or dvd+r) it has nothing to do with quality, there are some dvdrs that suck

R5= Region 5 a Russian dvd release almost as good as the dvd releases you might get from U.S. rental places

,olafty,2006-12-18T06:53Z,What do I need to watch this on my computer. I'm only getting audio. Sorry for being a nub :\ Help?

btw, you shuld change the name of the torrent title, 
i would prefer somfing else like : BP, but anyways this movie is great!"
,Troy90,2006-12-18T22:01Z,"""Olafty"": Use the ""VLC Media Player"". Its probably the best media player you're able to find.

Letar någon efter svensk text finns denna på ""www.undertexter.se"" och ""PUKKA"" -releasen är syncad så att den passar denna upload."
,krelle1983,2006-12-18T22:15Z,"well i don't use vlc, but a great program, but u can also download ace mega codec for free, then u can watch them on windows media player"
,Xlil_Mik3staX,2006-12-19T05:12Z,"Can ALLL the douches and grandfather douches lay off Jackal?, EVEN if he did upload pieces of dog shiet, you retards shouldnt talk to him like that..its a Bittorent site..ok..?
especially when this clearly isnt crap..best borat release even if someone renamed it from the Pukka release..who cares..its up for download..
