,the808,2011-04-21T08:13Z,"this is so EPIC! can't believe you have this/shared this/I found this. Just one for the ages, great to be able to hear them without all the production, funny thing is I'm a production NUT! love to hear them as a super dreamy indie band, before guthrie took them into space, lol. thanks so much, I'll seed this for as long as I see people needing it.
