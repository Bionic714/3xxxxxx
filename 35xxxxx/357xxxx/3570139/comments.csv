Thanks again L Hammond!!"
,pleaseturtle,2008-04-15T21:54Z,"just for anybody looking, much of this music is almost universally wrong. from the time i've spent studying the sheets for ""boogie woogie stomp"" i've come to find that almost none of the notes are correct. some of them are vaguely in the right area, and sometimes the left hand is mostly right, but almost everything is wrong, from the intro to the end. the last two pages aren't even the right arrangement much less the right notes"
[T],L_Hammond,2008-04-26T22:44Z,"Well, maybe I should have added one thing to the description: If you are in need of maybe the most accurate transcriptions of a number of boogie woogie classics, I would suggest the transcriptions made by Colin Davey at colindavey.com"
,mannshands,2010-04-11T20:39Z,"This file you mention: Albert Ammons, Meade Lux Lewis, Pete Johnson - Boogie Woogie Prayer.PDF
I cannot locate it anywhere. Any leads?
THX 4 UL!"
[T],L_Hammond,2010-06-16T10:01Z,"@ mannshands

Boogie Woogie Prayer is there, for sure. Both in PDF and JPF format.

I believe you encountered some bittorent quirk, so I suggest you to delete and restart this torrent and all should be fine."
