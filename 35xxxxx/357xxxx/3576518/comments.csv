,torrenting,2006-12-14T18:41Z,"This is a GREAT release from PUKKA. First, the quality is awesome on this. Picture looks great with a resolution of 672×352. Audio is also fantastic at AC3 5.1. There is a ""Property of..."" statement that runs across the bottom of the screen approximately 3-4 times the whole movie. This is a great release for a great movie.

,zver999,2006-12-16T19:02Z,"greaat release, god awful piece of shit film, this is why i don't go to the movies anymore... how they spent $90 lemons on this shit is beyond comprehension, things that live behind a public toilet seat can make better cinema lol"
,Lunar.Poet,2006-12-17T03:54Z,"Perfect DVD quality, there is no reason to wait for the DVD rip. This screener is the best I have ever seen. The only problem is the 3 or 4 times we see a warning at the bottom of the screen,"
,nissetheman2,2006-12-17T22:09Z,Kan någon förklara för mig varför i helsicke man delar upp filmen i 2 miljoner rar-filer? Jag har aldrig någonsin haft några problem när jag tankat hem  (t.e.x aXXos) avi-filer. Men rarfilerna är trasiga var och varannan gång... totalt obegripligt...
,Lunar.Poet,2006-12-19T03:33Z,Nissetheman2: I'm not sure why some like to split the movies into several rar files. But it takes 1-2 minutes to extract the avi file from the rar files. So... It's really no big deal.
,Hei_på-deg,2006-12-20T14:43Z,The movie is also worth watching^^
,dixontudeep,2006-12-22T08:35Z,well this movie should be coming out in theaters in 2 days

Also RARs are scene rules, and aXXo is not in the scene, he is just DVD ripper, and a great one at that.

Long live the Scene!"

,haniblecter,2007-01-02T15:35Z,"nvm, got an 'ac3 filter'.  Volume is crap. Excellent quality picture though."

por favor"
,screenslave,2007-01-11T21:58Z,"A film greatly anticipated, but quite a disappointment - a very bleak and weak look into the not-too-distant future. Some terrific scenery and what could-have-been an interesting story, but despite Clive Owen the movie soon turns into a death struggle. It goes nowhere. Afterwards it's like ""Oh, so it ended there...well, what happened?"". A lot of good ideas wasted in the end, too heavy on the symbolism and with a lot of reference to, f.i, The Bible & Jesus, V for Vendetta, 1984, The Survivors (TV-show mid-70ies) plus a lot else, blended into a tasteless mix. But hey, that's just kinda my opinion."
[V],bendowling,2007-01-12T21:25Z,looking forward to seeing this - downloaded the MPAA one last time (mavensupplieR) - stuck at 98% until I cancelled :(
