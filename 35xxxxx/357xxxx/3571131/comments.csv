[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-05T16:00Z,"well. the rar kinda' confirms it's real, and people who wants to share the episode through other protocols want's rar because of the hashcheck"
,Insilence,2006-12-05T16:36Z,"THANKS for this one! 
i love heroes! "
,Branstrom,2006-12-05T16:45Z,"Anyone could RAR a fake release. That doesn't confirm it's real. This shit takes up twice the diskspace if you want to be able to watch it + seed it, and it takes time to unRAR it so that you can begin watching."
,kultrex,2006-12-05T17:09Z,"Sample,  http://web.starman.ee/nordaland/"
,kalliku,2006-12-05T17:44Z,I think it's takes much more to rename all of the rars than rename an avi-file. So the rar is the best. And if you think it takes time to unrar maybe you should get a faster computer... These small archives don't take that long.
[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-05T17:58Z,"Of course RAR doesn't confirm that the release is real, but it it certainly makes you think so. The ""fake release uploaders"" doesn't take time to put it in rar. And as I said, many people wants it in rar for other p2p sharing protocols."
,Grooveline,2006-12-05T18:59Z,"just use one of the bunch auto-unrar scripts that you can find on the net.
They sfv-check, unrar & if you want, delete the rar files in case you're not in the mood to seed

Thanks Tedsharer & keep uploading rared releases!"
[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-05T19:17Z,"thanks Grooveline for making me not to kill myself ;)

I deleted the XOR release torrent now. Saw no point having it around."
,Impulse8006,2006-12-05T19:18Z,TY. Hope someone will upload the 720p version.
,Superflow,2006-12-05T19:36Z,"Aw yeah, 720P... Thanks for this in the meantime :)"
[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-05T22:06Z,If you want 720p then maybe I should upload it :)
,Impulse8006,2006-12-05T22:29Z,That would be awsome man. =) Then i will use my 2* 100mbit lines to seed =P
,biffaboy,2006-12-05T23:25Z,"Thanks for the upload Ted!
Now, all the people bitching about the usage of rars in torrents.
Nobody makes you download the stuff that people take the time to rip and upload.
Just be grateful that this is here for you to download at all.
If you don't like rars, feel free to rip this from hdtv yourself and upload it as an avi.
Just stop fucking moaning about it."
[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-06T00:00Z,"720p is up

,ezeikel,2006-12-06T03:26Z,"maybe im some kind of nube..or what you call it but i get nothing....how do i watch the episode when all i got was this strange files and a 1 min clip???? someone who can help me without using words as ""you need to unrar you stupid f-ck""....or is there something wrong with my download???
btw...What has happend to Tankafett????"
,biffaboy,2006-12-06T03:47Z,"ezeikel- Download and install Winrar. http://www.rarlabs.com/
When you've installed it, right click one of the files and select 'Extract here'.That will extract the movie from the archive."
,Rower,2006-12-06T20:18Z,"Branstrom: ehm, a real release should be in rar format, else its crap.."
,Jackass Jimm,2006-12-07T00:00Z,"The only reason I started downloading the aXXo releases were because they were not RAR'ed.  I didn't even know they were famous (or were going to be famous).  I just downloaded it since I saw that they just had a .txt and a .avi...which is what I want.  

I feel it pointless but I'm sure there has to be a legit reason (such as what someone pointed out about sharing in other programs...but really....they should just download it as is).  There is no point.  Downloaded movies (700 mb) take like 50 seconds to unrar...which sucks:). Its just a waste of time (imo).  

As for how to unRAR your stuff....Windows XP comes with a rar extractor....so.  Anyway, all you have to do is right click and press ""Extract Here"" or ""Extract files to..."" and then press ok on the following screen.  I still don't know how people do not know about .Rar or . ZIP files.  Those are commonplace in the internet.

[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-07T06:01Z,"The scene doesn't like p2p filesharers. thats because we touch their releases and rename them and stuff. But almost all the torrents I upload are rared, and untouched, which hopefully means that the scene will become less angry. Be  happy that you get to see this release at all. Gosh! You rar complainers makes me sick."
,Sylph01,2006-12-07T17:40Z,"Most of us non-rar types don't complain.  I wait patiently every week until someone torrents a non-rar'd video file.  I don't want your rar's that I have to have 2 copies of (one rar'd, one un-rar'd) and take up twice as much disc space.  I just want my avi.  Anyhows, back to sitting back patiently waiting.  Episode 11 will get avi'd eventually.  :P"
[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-07T21:31Z,"Gosh!? are you so stubborn that you won't even download it because of the RAR?! OMG!! Download, unrar and then stop seed the rar volumes if you want! 

I can't believe that, as an uploader, I get SHIT! Maybe we should make the scene more secure so noone could see the latest TV shows!

I will always try to upload the untouched (rared) release because that's the way the scene wants it to be! I don't always upload in rar because somtimes my sources aren't giving me them in rar, but rar is still the best!"
,bickertob122,2006-12-08T04:55Z,"Ted ignore all the moaners,
I for one am very grateful to get shows brand new from the u.s that aint even out in the uk. As far as the 50 seconds of my life wasted unraring them, i think i can let that go  gladly.
Keep on what your doing m8, its much appreciated by 542 people so far who have downloaded it, on this upload alone.

And ignore the winers saying
 '"" im getting something for absoloutely fuck all cost, but it takes me 50 seconds to make it watchable, its not good enuff, waaa mummy"""
[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-08T07:40Z,"more like 10000 downloads, TPB stats are way off as usual :)
Today, I'm uploading things in avi (not this release, only today's). Just to see if someone complains about things that aren't in rar ;)"
,matt3man,2006-12-08T08:01Z,".avi-releases is the path to the dark side! let's sat you download a film in .avi-format. 700mb, and it's broken! ""(/5!ÂŁ@$$?!!! ..you have to download it all over again. If you download a rar-release (thank heavens) and one or two files are broken, you only have to download 14mb or so to get a complete archive. And that's only one of the benefits! So stop moaning and like it for what it is. rar ftw! ^_^"
[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-08T08:22Z,"bittorrent has a built in hash check, so if you get a corrupt avi file you can just do the check and the client will donwload only the missing bytes."
,Sylph01,2006-12-08T12:04Z,"Ok, to be fair I will ask a question.  The reason I like AVI is that it's a single file.  I don't understand the multi-files of rar.  I appreciate people telling us to 'just unrar' them, but I'm pretty new to this (I only came on here to find games and got lucky to see that tv shows were also shared).  When I I unrar will I still have 10 files, or if I unrar the first one, will it auto merge them all into a single file or something?  My first time trying that I had 10 files that I had to unrar individually, and had no idea what to do with them because they had no file extensions.  Maybe I gave up to quickly, but that deterred me from downloading anything other than an avi right-quick."
,Sylph01,2006-12-08T13:56Z,"Ok, DL'd this one to test, and it worked fine.  Not sure what the problem was last time I got a rar file, didn't un-rar nicely into the avi like this one did.  "
[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-10T09:06Z,"""and got lucky to see that tv shows were also shared""
That's what I do ;)

Yeah, extracting scene (google it) releases should always be as easy as right click on one file -> extract here. If it doesn't work, then there's something wrong."
,.:jayjay:.,2006-12-12T13:30Z,when do episode 12 come out???
,Jeluxus,2006-12-13T09:35Z,"ok now I understand why this release came out on multi rar files...coz of hash fails that can cause for the movie to lose its qaulity,,i have also downloaded episode 11 in direct .avi and its kinda pixelated,,,so i guess its much better if the future releases will come out on rar files,.. and if ur comp is using shitloads of time unraring 360mb then i guess u will need to buy a new one or just throw ur comp against the wall or sumthing... grow up fellas"
,Sylph01,2006-12-15T15:57Z,Episode 12 doesn't air until the 22nd of January
,Stefanzon,2007-01-13T17:53Z,The best show ever made!
,djmadrus,2007-01-13T19:12Z,"omg,hey ppl why to complain about the rar files?!?    
I bet that u typed for longer time than it would be unraring,and the extra double space is going to be used by unraring is worth it.So enjoy it and stop complaining.I thank everyone who makes it possible to see ""Heroes"".This show is the best one i've seen.can't wait til new episode comes out : )"
,Xiol,2007-01-21T14:39Z,"I'm not complaining - either RAR'd or not makes no difference to me, and those 50 seconds of my life I 'waste' unraring these files I'd probably only spend wanking, so it's not too big a deal.

However, bittorrent does it's own hash checking, so the file you download will be the exact copy that the other person uploaded. RARing torrents is just redundant as it will not increase the reliabilty of getting the exact same file. "
[T],Tedsharer,2007-03-05T16:01Z,hahaahaha Xiol :D
,TheUnknown1000,2007-03-16T18:59Z,seed plez!!!! 
,Geldethi,2007-04-01T16:53Z,"Not complaining but raring files on bittorrent is redundant and just causes less seading, most either don't have the space for twice the filesize of whatever they download to keep the rar's or just delete them instantly anyway (admitedly this is normally on much bigger files but meh)"
,Callistox87,2007-04-28T20:37Z,"Shit download speeds, all day.

I will not be seeding."

,aceofvader,2008-07-17T04:43Z,"not to kick a dead thread but VLC plays file (avi) from within rar................................................

I cant believe ppl complain about everything back then^^"
