,johnhowe,2008-10-14T09:26Z,"It's hard to put into words how much I dislike this kind of thing. Engaging in copyright violation is probably considered all very daring and defiant of the system, but when artists can no longer make a living because their work has been so extensively pirated, the world will be a poorer place for all. 

There is little difference between this and the individual who stole 10 of my originals a few years ago. He liked my work too.

Sincerely yours,

John Howe"
,Hunner,2009-05-05T21:14Z,"John: It's not about being daring or defiant. People are 1. generally lazy, and 2. generally honest. Because they are lazy, if it is easier to download something illegally than to purchase it then they will. Because they are also honest, if there is an easy way to purchase something then they will. People *want* to give their money for things they like, but when lacking accessibility will turn to pirating.

You have hi-res jpegs up on your site, and I want to use them as desktop backgrounds but your anti-download JS sends me away. So I come here and can have them in 3 clicks.  I do not want hard copies at the moment; I want digital copies. I can't find digital copies for sale anywhere (I tried), so I torrent them. Offer easily-googleable easily-purchasable jpegs (resized to background-size or not) and I will pay for them. Because I want to give you money for your work."

I have all of his original books anyway, and the LOTR movies all baught by savings I did so hard. Both he and Alan made a couple of milions from their drawings and paintings during the LOTR shootings... and now he's talking about making a living and shit..."
