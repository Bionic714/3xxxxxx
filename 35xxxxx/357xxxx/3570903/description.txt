We've added RealDrums to Band-in-a-Box 2007 - these are audio drum styles that replace the MIDI Drum track with actual recordings of top studio Jazz/Rock/Country drummers! These are not "samples" of single drum hits; they are full recordings, lasting from 1 to 8 bars, playing along in perfect sync with the other Band-in-a-Box tracks. The results are dramatically better than MIDI. They sound like a real drummer, because they are recordings of a real drummer. And adding a real instrument to the mix makes all of the Band-in-a-Box parts sound more authentic. We include a huge library of RealDrums styles in the Regular Upgrade and Band-in-a-Box Pro packages and ALL of the RealDrums styles in the MegaPAK Upgrade or MegaPAK First-Time purchase packages.

This is only the drums, not the prog Band in a box

Have fun
