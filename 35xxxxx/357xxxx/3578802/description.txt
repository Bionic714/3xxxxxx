Review:
-------
New Age Space music. Atmospheric, contemplative and serene, with slow-moving
tempos. It is music for dreaming and relaxing, music for accompanying the views
of nature.

I discovered Max Corbacho's rich atmospheric music by chance just as I had 
found Robert Scott Thompson's masterpieces of computer generated ambience a 
year or so ago. Max is a Spaniard whose musical directions certainly are 
strongly influenced by RST, and also Steve Roach and Michael Stearns. But 
there is magic lurking in the textured landscapes of sound that Max Corbacho 
can deliver. There is a depth in his hypnotic layers of ambience that is 
rarely found anywhere in the world of new age music.And also a challenging 
variety of sounds as this exciting display of music moves though space and 
time. In the first three tracks Corbacho delivers a rhythm layed with 
soothing rich textures that simply fill one with calm and delight. The track 
'Night Caravan' is one of the most magnificent pieces of ambient music I have 
ever heard.

Then the aural topography changes to almost tribal rhythms on 'erosion' that 
one can imagine in a remote and desolate desert.From which one then returns 
to more familiar slopes of 'Quietness' or succumb in Corbacho's 'Death 
Valley'. The work ends in triumph or despair in the climax of 'Vestiges' 
where silence becomes buried forever in a catastrophic thundering finale.
