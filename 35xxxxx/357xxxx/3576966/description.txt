LINEAGE-SONY MZ-NH1 Hi-MD in Hi-SP mode, hand made cardoid mics, Greenmachine battery box>USB to PC converted to wav in Sonic Soundstage>volume boost in Sound Forge 7>Split tracks & Convert to FLAC (Level 8) in CD Wave Editor

RECORDING DETAILS- Approx 60 feet from stage, slightly to right of stage

Show Notes- Fantastic show-everything was right-performance, lighting, setlist and pretty good FOH sound too giving  a good clean recording with no overloading or brickwalling at any point. I'd like to dedicate this recording to the couple stood next to us who spent the entire gig gazing into each others eyes and hugging/kissing/groping each other-never once looking at the stage-For the price of their tickets, they could have got a room at the hotel up the road!!!

Ticket stub scan included. No artwork yet-I'll post it in the threads if I get some done.

Enjoy the recording, do as you please with it for your own listening pleasures and share freely-but be sure to buy the bands official releases-as they are really quite good!!
