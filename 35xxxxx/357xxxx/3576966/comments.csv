PEAC EOUT!"
,funkyduck,2006-12-16T03:05Z,"Many thanks for this torrent. I wanted to see Opeth live but it didn't happen. THe sound in this recording is very good.  Shame about the couple that just enjoyed each other, but you always get a couple like that at every show.
Keep up the good work.
Thanks again - very happy."
,tgrude,2006-12-17T09:03Z,"Yes, they are fuckin' amazing live, best live band ever.. best band ever.. !!! 

Yeah, as I said, the quality is quite good despite the fact that its a bootleg.
May I remind you, that this consert is the day before the consert that they were recording their 'possible dvd'.. :P
So 90% of the same setlist.

PEAC EOUT!!"

,gryphonavocatio,2007-10-30T10:45Z,This was one of the best gigs I've ever been to. I was just searching for Opeth in the dim hope that somebody might have bootlegged it. You are my hero.
,bengal21,2011-01-19T06:43Z,Is there anyone out there with the full torrent that could seed for a bit? I'm at 99.1% & would love to get the rest of this torrent. I will continue seeding as well. Thanks!
