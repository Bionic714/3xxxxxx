Greg Stump's second ski movie, from 1985. Lots of old school music and skiing, in massive amounts of powder, even a touch of comedy (the Utah Desert Ski Classic). Lots of early radical skiers who couldn't get a gig with Warren Miller! Before shaped boards, before snow boards, but still lots of fun. Enjoy. Ripped from VHS tape.
