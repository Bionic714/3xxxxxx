,torben kruse,2006-12-06T21:22Z,"my bittorrent says that there are no complere copies of this torrent, and that concersn me because im a big elvis fan :).
can some please seed the remaining parts, and i will seed the completed torrent for a whole day, or as long as it needed.
regards torben kruse."
,Miguel28,2006-12-06T21:40Z,"I'm seeding, and it's a full copy. As i restricted peers to 20 at the time (it's much more faster this way), probably you didn't enter the peer list yet, so you see no seeds. But you'll get your 100% copy, from me or from others. Let me know when you're complete."
,Miguel28,2006-12-06T21:51Z,"Another thing, you may find strange that the number of songs in some albums don't match with the number of songs on the back covers, but that's because since some have 30 and 40 songs, it wouldn't fit all in the back cover, so it's in the inlay book (which is not availabe here)."
,torben kruse,2006-12-07T00:36Z,"thanks a lot for you fast responce, i dont know much abaut this program (bittorrent or this site), so its nice that's somebody does :)
thanks once again and i will leave a message when its finished downloading. Regards Torben Kruse."

Entiendes español?? quiero descargarme la colección de Elvis de masters ya que soy una gran fan de Elvis Presley, y no sé cómo hacerlo. 

Me podrías ayudar??"
,MMonterosso,2008-02-05T05:51Z,"Very Cool Collection here for a newbie to torrents
Thanks for the post from a very long time ago.  I was wondering if you have received any private feedback about the ""His Hand In Mine Sessions"". As I'm listening I?m hearing Vol. 1, 2 & 3 are full of skips and cutouts - Vol. 4 is intact. Perhaps the torrent has been around the block a few times and it?s scratched up a bit?... Any Chance on a repost of those 3 mentioned?? - Thanks again for the many hours of listening euphoria

And thanks for the upload!"
,kajsa89,2008-12-29T15:01Z,"May I humbly ask if some seeder(s) could boost the upload speed for this, as my download is literally/virtually at a standstill? I'd be very grateful...and I will seed this for a long time once/if I finish it. See Jungleland for my track record."
,kajsa89,2008-12-29T15:38Z,Sorry for the above post. I meant to request this for another torrent.... I am seeding this one.
