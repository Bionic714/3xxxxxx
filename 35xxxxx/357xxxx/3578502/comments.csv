,Ntsu,2006-12-19T17:42Z,"It doesn't work... I only get an empty dialog when I enter this key, then Rb closes. (And yes, I have a Mac and the proper release)"
,Ntsu,2006-12-19T21:10Z,"Ok, I got it working. First time choose ""Demo"", close RealBasic, restart and enter key. 

Next time you restart instead of ""15 days remaining"", it will say ""23441 days remaining"". 

Works for me...

Sorry, for complaining earlier. Maybe this torrent wasnÂ´t meant for the free-download-demo-version-unlock. But hey, a little more info wouldnÂ´t hurt."
,cable_guy6,2006-12-22T19:00Z,Could someone seed or just post the key here?

,MusicEd,2006-12-28T23:45Z,"It does work after loading the latest RealBasic 2006r4 build. But it remains a demo. That means it's useless. Applications you create with it run only for 5 minutes and expire after 12 days.
Anyone a better serial?"

Thats probably because your trying to cross platform compile on a standard edition, stand ed only allows a cross plat compile to to work for 5 mins, if anyone finds the professional addition pleaase post here, i have the same problem with compiling."
,eduo,2009-01-24T00:02Z,This doesn't work in later 2008 releases. Has anyone got a newer serial for the 2008r5.1 version?
