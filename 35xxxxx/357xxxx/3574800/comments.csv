,desnake,2007-03-22T18:09Z,I see your name is iskongen so i gues you are norwegian. So i am wondering is this the Norwegian Dubbeb Disney Channel version or English version ?
,snag72,2007-03-23T16:16Z,"Yes it is. But I don't think the one you download here is. (Dubbeb) Hmm, Boinic Boy isn't a real episode, it is the same as ""New kid in School"", but they changed the name."

,dgry,2007-06-28T16:14Z,"Do you have s01 e26 - Bad Moose Rising

And Are They in wright order?"
,cyrolancer,2007-07-08T03:21Z,"Thanks for this superior upload.

As I have watched and compared some episodes from wikipedia, I think that some episode names are mixed and at least one episode is missing.

I will be watching and comparing them completely in a few days and update my comment and if there is a problem with episode numbering or any missing episodes, I will post here

Thanks again for your great efford."
,cyrolancer,2007-07-14T14:54Z,"Well :) Found the video that is missing in this torrent: ""Schooly Bully"" which will be the 23th episode (S01E23) of HM.

Also, up to 20th episode, everything is in the right order. Later on, things change a bit:

Hannah Montana s01 e21 = 24th episode
Hannah Montana s01 e22 = 26th episode
Hannah Montana s01 e23 = 22nd episode
Hannah Montana s01 e24 = 25th episode
Hannah Montana s01 e25 = 21st episode

and 23th episode is missing.

As you can notice from the episode listings in Wikipedia, the production #'s of HM is in different order. For instance, 1st episode is called S01E01 whereas 2nd episode is S01E04.

In this torrent you will be finding all in the order of ""airdate"" not in the order of ""production #"""

,Reidarm,2007-08-11T02:51Z,"There is 26 episodes in Season 1. It says there are 25 episodes here.. 1 is missing, like cyrolancer is saying.. Where can i get the Missing file ?"
,Reidarm,2007-08-11T16:10Z,"Which program, do you guyz use ? Does it work with VLC ?"
,cyrolancer,2007-08-17T21:44Z,"@Reidarm, I used emule to get the missing episode. I couldn't find it on here or any other torrent site.

Also, they work with VLC :)"
,Reidarm,2007-08-19T01:08Z,Did you use emule to get the missing episode (23) ? It is Episode 23 that is missing right ? But what is Emule? I need to download the episode. When is Season 2 ready for download here ? :D
,fridosan,2007-08-20T15:55Z,"It's the Season 1, Episode 21: My Boyfriend's Jackson and There's Gonna Be Trouble that's missin, dont know but the episodes ar mixxed up."
,cyrolancer,2007-09-07T23:31Z,"@fridosan, I am pretty sure that Episode 21 is missing. I just watched and compared using wikipedia.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hannah_montana_episodes

I think I have mentioned it one of my comments earlier. Just believe me :) and read my previous comment for the correct airdate order."
,cyrolancer,2007-09-07T23:35Z,"@Reidarm, try emule-project.org website for details about Emule."
,cyrolancer,2007-09-08T02:05Z,"fridosan, I mean to say episode 23, not episode 21. Sorry about it."
,ilikepiratedthings,2007-09-26T03:40Z,"these videos have good quality. if u don't need te whole episodes from 1-25, simply just uncheck the boxes u dont need. for episode listings, here is the link: http://www.tv.com/hannah-montana/show/48004/episode_listings.html?tag=subtabs;list . i highly recommend this torrent if u need season 1 episodes."
