,r0tt3n,2006-12-09T20:48Z,"the other torrent with the same name as this one is a few megabytes larger than this one - anyone know what the difference is? 

Also, a lot of people on the other torrent are commenting that the audio goes from stereo to mono and the quality because aweful after about 3 seconds - is that the case with this one too?"
