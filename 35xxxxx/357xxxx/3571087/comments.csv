,Jan-Bertil,2007-05-08T10:54Z,"WARNING!!!!!
Why on earth do people bother to upload crap that's coded in a bitrate of 128????
At least have the decensy to disclose it in the torrent desacription, FFS!!!!!! Crap....."
,Vandangomis,2007-06-16T18:06Z,"Jan-Bertil
Gay talk"
,Wonderstuff,2007-07-05T09:36Z,"Jan-Bertil: what a queer comment! Poofters like you look more to the bitrate than to the content. And if this annoys your poofass that much, why the hell do you bother downloading it or even commenting it? Put out some torrents yourself, we all wait for that immaculate speed and bitrate of 9999999999999999999999999,9 that only you can bring."
,wonderboy22,2007-10-30T01:28Z,Why hope for quality when you can get quantity? Hmmmm... maybe both? Naaahh!
,Haloth13,2007-11-18T16:02Z,seed please
,bobaganoush,2007-12-19T11:45Z,"Great collection. Only problem I noticed is that ""African Night Flight"" from Lodger is actually a Backstreet Boys song..."
,Harts4Life,2008-02-04T07:56Z,"(quote Jan-Bertl)Why on earth do people bother to upload crap that's coded in a bitrate of 128????(/quote)

Oh, I don't know, perhaps because 128 is CD quality, and pretty much the only difference between 128 bit and anything higher is the size of the file?  But hey, for some people, file-size is everything ..."
,kingglade,2008-03-15T11:31Z,"Thanks to aodren14 for such an awesome upload!  Much enjoyed browsing thru the pics and 128kbps is a pretty standard quality which is fine to listen to.

Cheers!"

,nilbud,2008-04-15T18:45Z,Unfortunately 128 is crap.
,Aphoniac,2008-04-17T17:32Z,"You're all a bunch of idiots. Fairly complete discography of one of the greatest artists in the history of modern music, for free, and you bitch about the difference between 128 and FLAC. If you're seriously that much of an audiophile, why the hell are you downloading a torrent 'o' mp3's?

Know what my bitch is? No one is seeding."
