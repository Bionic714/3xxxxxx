,baabis,2006-12-06T16:51Z,"@ Zkalos, thx my friend..but what sort of crack is it? is it a loader or is it gauge file(There have been out a gauge file-crack somewhere here, but that doesn't even work to 50%)?

@ monstert; the loadeditor is in the aircraft, it is in that box where you choose to open etc the overhead..."

,baabis,2006-12-08T19:40Z,"This looks like the version that didn't work :-(. Atleast if I should trust the 'Load Manager', it closes when I press 'Full Load'. Though, I did not test the plane yet."
,niblem,2006-12-08T20:24Z,How do you install this thing?
,Panodilo,2006-12-08T22:04Z,This bitch won't put out. The installer aborts.
,baabis,2006-12-08T22:14Z,"@ niblem, make a folder in your harddrive (C:) that is called Flight One Software .. now it should look like this: ""C:\Flight One Software"". put the .lic file from the extracted Flight One Software folder in the ""C:\Flight One Software"" folder.

@ Panodilo, I guess it is that .lic problem/error? If so, just do as I told niblem to do.."
,Panodilo,2006-12-08T22:42Z,Aha. Creating a folder called Flight One Software didn't help. Lic has to be dropped straight into Windows folder. Then the installer starts. Now I will have a noodle soup. You know the quicky ones? They make my stools so hard it's like trying to shit out a forty inch black rubber cock.
,shager,2006-12-08T22:49Z,"a big thank you for this , works fine apart from that the  textue instaler , load manager and fleet manager don't work , but no big problem , fuel manager does work ,

this problem is not new and that it at least works is old thing.. we need to get the loader to work to plan for the flight and the AP and the Concorde system to work ot fly correctly.. we won't be doing visuals..tho...this was the 3rd attempt..and nothing new..

thx anyway..

hope someone can get the SSTSIM to work.. cann't wildman crack it the hell out.. both.."
,vincent@vega,2006-12-09T07:09Z,"it is working without problems ... thx

first get all folders to where they belong and the lic to windows ... than the installer works ... after the install is finished do again the folder operations and copy all over again ... after that the loader and all other things are working ... now you can fire up your FS and go flying !!! 

btw: dont forget to look that the path to fs is in your registry ...

,Tipez,2008-06-18T09:24Z,"Guys, could you help me please? I installed this one, but when I try to load the model my FS encounters a problem and crashes. Do you know how to solve this?"
,yourmotherinlaw,2008-06-28T22:46Z,"Okay, install miserably failed. I can't even bloody use FS anymore because it says LAL INVALID LICENSE FS WILL QUIT LAL.

Here's what I did:

Unzip files.

Create Flight One Software folder and moved installer + .lic-file there

Dropped .lic-file in main C:\windows folder

Ran installer

Installed Civa-INS

Dumped the gauges & modules folders in their respective places, as well as the load manager and shizzle.

Now, as if that didn't rape my day enough, I can't find the bloody uninstaller @_@."
,yourmotherinlaw,2008-06-28T23:07Z,"VICTORY!

Seemingly another installer for the SSTsim which didn't work left some bad register entries! Removing these and then just doing a reinstall got me rid of the annoying ''LAL, U HAEV INVALID LICENS FS QUIT KTNHXBAI"" message =].

However, I still can't fly the airplane. I can select it, but when I click 'Fly' FS simply gives me the 'FS encountered a problem and needs to quit' message... =[. Any advice on a workaround for this?"

,andrwcpr,2008-08-01T01:56Z,"when i install it, it says fs2004 isn't found so it can't carry on with the installation.. which is understandable, as i have fsx
but i was wondering, is there any chance anyone could upload a rip of this?
like the actual files and not just the installer?
thx in advance"
,andrwcpr,2008-08-01T02:05Z,"or maybe could someone upload the new fsx version of it?
it only just came out but i'm sure i'm not the only one who would appreciate the upload"
,AssramsDkorda,2008-10-22T18:31Z,"Thanks to zkalos and all the seeders :)

If anyone else is having problems with the texture installer, load manager, etc. (nothing happens when you click, or you get an error message about windows explorer not being able to find a sstmchk4.dll in directory ./data/....) i am about to start working on a .exe fix that changes the search path to the .dll file, since it is actually installed. I saw a comment on here on page 2 i think saying the .exe's must be moved to the Flight Simulator 9/SSTSIM folder but I've not tried it yet. I'll still post the new fixes on here for all the people who find themselves frustrated out of their minds :)

,ericcartman500,2009-04-16T14:20Z,"1. put the .lic file you will get in under crack/windows. 
2.move or copy the .lic to C:/windows
3. Crate a new file in C:/ called Flight One Software (if you do not alrady have one from a previous flight one product) it should look like C:/Flight One Software. 
4. Put the .lic file there also. 
5.Run the installer
once installation finishes do not touch anything!
TO SAVE YOUR FS FROM CRASHING DO THIS >> 
1. rather than installing civa140 which is given in the torrent (and seems to make fs9 break down) you will get an option at the end of the installer to go to a website where you can download civa151 which is newer and wont break fs ^^ enjoy"
,FSimmer,2009-05-28T22:52Z,Does this work on Vista64 bit?
,pranav2007,2009-06-22T21:15Z,"omg i see evryone here have problem...I got this full SSTSIM working all the planes work, this is awsome... 
NOW LISTEN TO ME.. I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM THAT EVRY ONE HERE DID AND I MANAGED TO FIX IT.. JUST FOLLOW ME.

ok from the beginig:

1) downlaod this thing


2)after you downlaod go to >>> ""crack"" then you will see ""Windows""...  in that you will see ""sstv10.lic""
3) copy ""sstv10.lic"" and paste it in ""C:\WINDOWS"" (to get there go to my computer then go to local disk  then there you will see windows and then paste it in windows folder).

4) Now go back to the downlaoded torrent and then go to  ""Flight One Software"" folder  and double click on ""SSTSIM_Setup"".

5) you should have no problems downlaoding expect one problem  if you have problem on installation then continue read step 5. -------if you have ""fs9 dose not exist"" problem which i had, then that mean that you do not have correct fs2004 (FS9) patch, what i mean is that you must have your fs2004 instaled in ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator 9"".


6) after you have installed, you will have some icon on your destop, dont click on them because they wont work..  go to step 7

7) ok go to the downlaoded torrent and go to ""crack"" folder again, then go to ""Modules"" and  copy  ""SSTSIM.dll"" and paste it in your Main FS9 Modules which is ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator 9\Modules""

8) ok this bit is confusing so read care fully!!
go to ""crack"" folder then to ""Gauges"" then to ""Sstsim"" in then you will see two Gauge file called ""Conc2kFuel.gau""  and ""Conc2kserver.gau""  copy both of them and paste them to  ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator 9\Gauges\SSTSIM""
when you paste it, it will aks you to overwrte click ""yes"".  for noobs who dosnt know where ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator 9\Gauges\SSTSIM""  is then go to ""microsoft games"" >> ""Flight Simulater 9"" >>""Gauge"">>>""SSTSIM"" and paste it in there.

9) omg nearlly done!
go to ""crack"" then you will see three icon called ""Fleet Manager""  ""Load Manager"" and ""Texture Installer"", NOW COPY three of them and paste it in ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator 9\SSTSIM""  It will ask you to overwrite them which you must!

10) omg finally you are done! the SSTSIM icon on the destop will now work and the plane will load!

i might release the video for this and might upload it to my channel

tyyyyyyy"
,valiva95,2009-07-25T12:19Z,"OK, is there somebody who got it fully working and how? I followed the instructions, but the utilities keep crashing. About the autopilot-in my opinion there is something with the FSUIPC, but what?"
,BenedictXVIv1,2009-11-25T18:33Z,"Ok, there is a problem with the Load Manager and ive read a couple of older post stating the same problem but no solution : you click on it ""Save"" ""Full Load"" or anything else other than tank 11 and it crash, is that it for all of you guys or is there an actual fix to this? I followed Pranav2007 instruction to the letter and still the load manager cant save or register the new fuel value i give it. It would be great to know if something can be done about it because it's an important tool for the flight."

,BenedictXVIv1,2010-06-10T23:51Z,god damnit SEED. 
,phaezshre,2010-12-30T16:10Z,"The Fuel Manager was not cracked. Therefore, I doubt anyone who has installed it has managed to utilize it. Not sure if anyone else experiencing similar issues. However, my A/P will only work in Heading Hold, Altitude Hold, and Approach modes (when tuned to an ILS). Anything else will not function correctly.

A/T will not move throttle levers. IAS Hold will not control pitch to maintain an airspeed. INS will not navigate based on INS data. HDG TRK will fly 360 MAG and not the desired heading.

While the plane flies great, all the systems appear to be messed up."
