It has a 50/60 hertz selector (for those of you that know what it is) and unfortunately you cannot select the language you play in. It will load in whatever language your gamecube is set to."

,Dendryge,2006-12-19T12:07Z,"Serious guys if you wanna download gc games PB sucks ass... :P
I recommend http://gctracker.mine.nu:800/ check the seeding on Zelda on Johs :P."
,SoundWall,2006-12-19T19:39Z,"Dendryge,
Ya right. I DID check that crappy site out. Zelda had at the most 29 seeders there. Here it's got 37 as of now. TPB rules! Bitch.

And to all of you who are stupid enough to play this game on GC: BUY A FREAKING WII!! Then you'll get the ultimate experience from the game."

,dabean2,2007-01-05T20:38Z,"no, you have to have a gc with modchip"
,mannyd,2007-01-08T11:41Z,"this works with the streaming starcube gc loader with phantasy star exploit, rather well actually"

,mannyd,2007-01-10T12:52Z,"i would get a wii if i could, but they are still in demand unlike the ps3 which is available everywhere nowadays :P"
,jarret08,2007-02-02T11:48Z,Have you ever played it with an YUV cable?! The Graiks is quite the same as on Wii. No need to buy an Wii untill now!
,Szimen,2007-03-21T22:46Z,"EVERYBODY WHO WONDERS HOW TO PLAY DOWNLOADED GAMECUBE GAMES: OPTION 1. Get ""Dolphin"" gamecube emulator at www.dolphin-emu.com/downloads.php AND PLAY WITH A .GCM FILE (ISO=GCM just rename the file if it's an iso file) but this laggs aLOT, because of the custom processor in the GC processes things differently than a computer processor. The 450mHz GC processer doesn't lagg. A P4 4500mHz does. You get max 10 fps, it isn't worth the try.
OPTION 2. Get yourself a modchip, e.g Viper GC Extreme . This needs to be soldered inside your cube, and voids warranty. Also you need to buy mini DVD's and if you don't have one - a REGULAR DVD-RW drive. Burn the downloaded iso to the disc, and follow the modchip instructions. again - .gcm=.iso
To play on emulator rename to .gcm, to burn, rename to .iso"
