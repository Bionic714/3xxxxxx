,AKAliaz,2006-12-15T07:40Z,"just like any other audio file you just need the codec installed, do a google search for klite codec pack and install it. btw flac=lossless, just thought i would tell ya cuz you seem new to flac."
,DanTit,2006-12-15T14:29Z,Yea.. Never seen any FLACs before now :) Thanks dude d:)
,Azurge,2007-04-20T17:04Z,"FLAC can be played in Winamp and VLC, most of you should have one of those installed.

But are there any seeders?
I am stuck at 97%, and I am the one with the most complete download.
I have seeded 1.8 allready, so If someone would please seed the last 3%, I can seed a while longer."
