Story: The Kristiansand-band "Darkside of the Force" won a "Klapp-award" and 100.000NKR (about 12000?) in prize-money for a music video. This is the result. The band and their manager was so furious over the video that it got pulled and never released. Obviously he has no idea how much it cost to make a decent video.

The video was online a short while on a couple of news and rock-sites, but was pulled. Too slow :)

So I hereby bring you the video - it's not the best quality, but decent enough. Was this worth 12000 euro?
