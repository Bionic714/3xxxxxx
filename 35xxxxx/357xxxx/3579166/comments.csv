,P4p3Rc1iP,2006-12-18T18:01Z,"I figured this might not be the real one since it's missing a wargear/upgrades/armory list, but I just had a look at the real one, and it doesn't have it either... Makes it quite annoying to build a list out of it since rules for items are all over the place which makes it really annoying to look stuff up (Also, some references to pages are fucked up...).

Looks like GW did a terrible job with this new codex..."
,Gowsk,2007-01-06T03:43Z,Can somebody seed this please?
,Mikochi,2007-01-12T15:00Z,I can confirm this is the latest one. Personally I think they did a good job on it. As soon as you've used the codex for a while you'll know what various wargear and such does by heart as well as where to look it up.
,Chaos_Seer,2007-03-19T17:09Z,"If someone would seed this for me, that'd be very helpful. I only need 5.38 megs!"
,TYCH0N,2008-10-28T19:00Z,"Yes, this is the latest Eldar Codex.
Thanks for seeding, fellas."
