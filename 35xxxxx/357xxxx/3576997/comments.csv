,thepurplered,2006-12-17T23:25Z,This needs seeding in a bad way - can anyone help?
,Zeenax23,2006-12-18T06:04Z,"Thepurplered, 

Unfortunatly, I am the only seeder because I am the only one that has a compleate copy of the torrent (I created it and uploded it).   Once there is another full copy download should be faster.  But for now you will just have to wait if you want this torrent.  I am uploading at 100mbps   shouldn't be too long... :)"

Does anypne know of any other movie packs?"
,Klasic Kumputerz,2007-12-05T03:08Z,"These movies are in English as primary audio language. There are no menu systems. These are in full screen format. There are no special features or extras. Excellent video & audio quality. There could have been a few other movies added like ""White Christmas"", ""It's A Wonderfull Life"", ""Jingle All The Way"", National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" etc. It took me 1 1/2 days to download."

,kenneth90111,2007-12-16T13:26Z,"c'mon!! please seed, got like 3,2kb/s, please dont hit and run. Seed after you finish downloading. 1460 peers and 158 seeders =("
,kenneth90111,2007-12-16T13:27Z,"now its 0,2kb/s... this sux"
,slowjetta,2007-12-19T06:17Z,PLEASE SEED !!!
,huldre,2007-12-20T18:02Z,It's so wonderful to read people complaining about d/l speed after the u/ler explained the situation.  If someone wants it faster GO BUY THE DVD!  Thanks for the d/l.
,xhizors,2007-12-21T01:36Z,"@huldre: I would normally agree with you, but when 125 seeds are not seeding and when seeders are seeding at 0,1kb/s and peers downloading at 1,5mb/s aren't seeding... then i'd have to call them a bunch of twats. ALTHOUGH, Thank you very much for the upload Zeenax!!"
