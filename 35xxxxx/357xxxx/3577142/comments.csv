Also, if this is a screener, was the source VHS or DVD, and is it widescreen or not?"
,torrenting,2006-12-15T18:28Z,"Kaotik, this is a VHS screener and fullscreen.
Picture is a little blurry and pixelated but better than camera quality for sure. There is a watermark on the bottom left corner that has been blurred out and is noticable at times. Audio is bad at all.
