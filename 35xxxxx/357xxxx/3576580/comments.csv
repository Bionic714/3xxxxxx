,ma678,2006-12-14T18:46Z,What files are included in the package?
,b52flyer,2006-12-15T02:35Z,Its just the upgrade to WM5 but beware there is no downgrade file as there is in the full CD from HP. I have used this to upgrade and it works fine but now I've tried it  I dont like WM5 and would like to get back to WM2003 so if anyone has that file I would be grateful if they could seed it
,mrpijey,2006-12-15T18:30Z,"If this is the original HP CD then there should be a downgrade included on the disc. My last three HP PDA:s had it on their discs, so it should be on this one as well."
,2mat,2006-12-15T21:00Z,does it works on hp2210 `?
,b52flyer,2006-12-25T10:59Z,I think I missed it first time around there appears to be an option to revert back to your original firmware afterall. When you get to the part where it says continue or skip if you chose the skip option you then get to where it allows you to revert back to your original firmware. If anyone has tried it can they report back please?
