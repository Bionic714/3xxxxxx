,Grlarshh,2007-01-09T07:41Z,"Does this work?
ive dl other version with regestry and all but none of them work...says they expired"
,monnie110,2007-01-18T23:08Z,Hey Grlarshh. I had the same problem. My other ones stopped working because of the reg. This one works great and it's XXL version. 
,monnie110,2007-01-19T00:26Z,"An Update:
  When you use FL with Cubase, the rewire device is used with FL and it fuctions only in Demo mode when the rewire device is on. So I can't use this with Cubase. Have to find one that does and the reg file isn't expired. :/"
,monnie110,2007-01-19T04:09Z,"Update 2:
Okay just setthe year on your computer to 2004 and that will fix it"
,@Hepau,2007-01-30T21:04Z,"Im having the same problem as Trancerrr,
it says it will be impossible to unRAR the flstudio604_install.exe until I put in the correct volume bla bla bla.

Anyone had this problem?"
,Mogff3,2007-01-31T15:22Z,"@Hepau: as i posted earlier. 
1: use WinRAR for f*ck sake!
2: mark all .zip files
3: right click and chose ""unpack files""
4: doubleclick on one of the .r00 files
5: unpack them and DONE"
,Unsunghero737,2007-02-02T18:35Z,sorry to sound ignorant but i don't know how to mark the files
,Mogff3,2007-02-09T20:22Z,"just use ctrl+a in the map and they are marked, and maby ctrl and unclick the nfo / id"
