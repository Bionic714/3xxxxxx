,heffla,2006-12-26T19:45Z,the subs are not quite correct though...terrible actually.
,Baloo2,2007-01-03T02:19Z,"Heffla, what's so terrible about the subtitles? I think they are quite good -- most importantly they are perfectly sync'ed, something that is rather hard to accomplish.

And yes, obviously this is a download that I put together from pieces I picked up from different places, just to make a complete download. Thanks for helping me out on this and season 2, i-man1eMule!"

,AnOkAlias,2012-04-30T06:23Z,"@lPyrokinetic, What's fucking stupid... is the fact that you're not only bitching about (as opposed to ""constructive criticism"") something that you're not even PAYING FOR... but the fact that same language subtitles are EXTREMELY useful, for... (drum-roll)... the deaf & hard of hearing (SDH)... that is... assuming they're ""good""."

You translate to english but you forgot translated into Swedish as well, not everyone can english."
