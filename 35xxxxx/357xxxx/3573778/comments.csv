,saspi,2006-12-15T14:12Z,"It asks for the Device ID, but after entering the ID nothing happens. What am I doing wrong? And why does it say in the text file ""TM6"" when the file is ""TT6""? Any secrets here? Will it work for MAPS and TomTom GO?"
,saspi,2006-12-15T21:14Z,"Got it now.... But it is not the correct code for the maps. Not the crack they write about in www.yourNAV.com 
So maybe there are more crack-files to download. Where to find 'em?"
