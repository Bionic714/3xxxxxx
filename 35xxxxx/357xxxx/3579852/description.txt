Description:
"Sophie, a quiet and plain girl working in a hat shop, finds her life thrown into turmoil when she is literally swept off her feet by a mysterious but handsome wizard named Howl. The vain and vengeful Witch of the Waste, jealous of their friendship, puts a curse on Sophie. To her horror, Sophie discovers the spell has turned her into an elderly woman. She then embarks on an incredible odyssey to lift the curse and enters a magical world where fires talk, dogs spy for their wizard owners, and a ramshackle castle wanders across the countryside."
