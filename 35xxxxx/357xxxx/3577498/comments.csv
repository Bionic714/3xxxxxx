,leftofftheark,2008-07-07T08:06Z,"RPG = Role Playing Game
A game in which you take on the role of a character, acting out as them. The term is vague and can only find definition in cultural reference. These games are characterized by leveling systems, fantasy, and nearly all combat that isn't adventure/fps. Diablo is as much an RPG as any Final Fantasy (a game with ONE story line) game is, and it's called a JRPG."

,urmuma,2008-12-08T06:30Z,"it is fun to get a rogue with  sword and shield a kings of haste or whatever and a high ac shield,
i had a rogue level 42 or smth and she had around 311 AC and hardly got hit in hell/hell
against melee monsters, when there was a ranged monster i switched to my bow,
it was good when there was a level with only melee or a level with only ranged.
there is no need at all to dupe or use cheats, there is more of a feeling of accomplishment when you play Legit (legitimate) characters,
if ur gunna cheat might aswell get a pillow cos it is so boring and accomplish nothing, and dont look forward to getting a better weapon, etc.
there is a way to play called (Iron Man)  get 2 other people 3 total and have different character classes, start with level 1 characters, go into the church and finnish the whole level before moving on, get people to wait at the door either side, get person to bring monsters back then hit them, playing this way you dont buy from Griswold,Adria,Pepin, or ID With Cain,  once you start before you go into the church you have a 1 off chance to buy from shops with ur initial 100GP, it takes longer to play this way but it is pretty fun."

,bananakush,2009-03-02T06:31Z,seeding
,badprenup,2009-03-10T09:00Z,"downloads fast enough when LT seeders are seeding. And I agree that arguing on this game's genre is absolutely retarded and pointless. That being said, this is the internet so time to throw my hat into the ring.

First off, the definition of an RPG is a game in which the participants assume the roles of fictional characters. Participants determine the actions of their characters based on their characterization, and the actions succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines. Within the rules, players have the freedom to improvise; their choices shape the direction and outcome of the game.

RPG is a broad term, because in almost every game you take the role of a character and have a defined name and title. GTA4 is never defined as an RPG, but do you not assume the role of Niko Bellic? There are therefore almost limitless subgenres of RPGs, pretty much every game that you get to upgrade your characters skills how you like and then play to your strengths.

A true RPG is very hard to find, mainly because there hasn't really been one since D&D. RPing is more a mindset now, you assume the role of your character. So while this game is a hack and slash RPG, if you find the right group of players you can RP your hearts out. People may not like WoW, but you play on the Argent Dawn server as an Alliance character and, well not many places where you can sell your friends character as a slave for 5 Gold, (Me and my friends do this when out server is down, I sell them, they log out and make new characters, rinse repeat. Most RPers are so friggen stupid =-P)"

,al1500,2009-07-25T23:24Z,If anyone had the problem of running the game a second time because of no damn crack..you should try to find the Virtual Clone Drive file located in your diablo hellfire file click on that and your save and all that shit should still be there everytime u start it up.

Tried some things that others recomended to set the both games for win98/winme and from properties to reduce the hardware acceleration also like some recommended...

Also, 90% of RPG's are in fact Hack & Slash Games and those people saying this isn't an RPG I am sure the developers of this game who have years of experience know what Genre it is!

When you mount the image, mount the .BIN file, not the .CUE file.

,eraevn,2012-03-25T03:53Z,"First, Running Hellfire:
This is an actual produced Expansion Pack. It is a SINGLE PLAYER expansion. You can not run it on multiplayer without a mod. That being said, use Daemon Tools or a similar program (alcohol 120%, powerISO etc.) to mount the files and install the game and expansion. To play, mount the diablo disc on the virtual drive, and you will be able to play. If you want to play the expansion, you will need to run hellfire, either from a desktop icon or from the start menu. To play Diablo alone (most likely for multiplayer) you need to run it from its own icon. You will need to go patch it to make it run on battlenet, but from what I saw, it was pretty dead. Going off this, this will solve the no cd issue. Hellfire is only needed for installing the expansion. Still haven't been able to fix the color issue. "
,Suriyel,2012-04-24T18:58Z,"Here's a detailed step-by-step guide to playing Diablo, Hellfire(Expansion) and how to fix the color.


To play Diablo:
-Mount DIABLO.cue
-Install game
-You can now play Diablo by clicking on Diablo.exe in the folder where you installed the game. (The default location should be: Program Files>Diablo>Diablo.exe)


To play Hellfire (Expansion):
-Mount HELLFIRE.cue (Can't remember the file type, but it's the file that's not 400mb+)
-Install game
-Unmount HELLFIRE and mount DIABLO.cue
-You can now play Hellfire by clicking on hellfire.exe in the folder where you installed the game. (The default location should be: C:>SIERRA>HELLFIRE>hellfire.exe)


To fix the color for Diablo:
Solution by stevyb95 CREDITS GOES TO HIM.
-Create a new Text Document
-Copy and paste the following:

@echo off
 taskkill /f /im explorer.exe
 start Diablo.exe
 pause
 echo if you want to get desktop back press any key
 pause
 start explorer.exe

-Save as (File name: diablofix.BAT)(File type: All files)
-Move the newly created BAT file into Diablo folder
-Play the game by clicking on the BAT file instead of Diablo.exe from now on


To fix the color for Hellfire:
-Do exactly the same as the above, just change the line 'start Diablo.exe' to start 'hellfire.exe' (Without the quotations)
-Save the file name as hellfirefix.BAT instead
-Move the newly created BAT file into Hellfire folder
-Play the game by clicking on the BAT file instead of hellfire.exe from now on


ALWAYS REMEMBER TO MOUNT DIABLO.CUE FIRST BEFORE PLAYING EITHER DIABLO OR HELLFIRE, OR ELSE YOU WILL GET THE 'INSERT CD' ERROR!"
,Suriyel,2012-04-24T19:12Z,"Additional information for the guide above:

-You will need to install Diablo first before installing Hellfire as it is an expansion
-To mount DIABLO.cue, HELLFIRE.cue and many other torrent games, you will first need mounting programs such as Magic Disc and Magic ISO or Daemon Tools"

,Afrcngy,2012-06-14T05:35Z,"Hey guys,

Thanks for all of the help so far, seems great. One problem though. When I use the color fix for Hellfire, it doesn't register that I have the CD mounted on Daemon Tools. However, it registers the CD being mounted when I run DiabloFix.bat. Any idea why that is?

If I hit cancel when it asks me to insert the CD, I get an error message with running 'diabdat.mpq'

Please help!!!"
,Afrcngy,2012-06-14T05:43Z,"Nevermind! I figure it out. Just do what ez 100 sugggestd:

""For those having diabdat.mpq / No CD issue.

1. install the game using .bat image.
2. After installing find the Diablo.exe (eg. C:Program FilesDiablo)
3. Go to properties > Compatibility

6. Disable your 2nd monitor (desktop>properties>settings>uncheck extend my windows desktop onto this monitor.
