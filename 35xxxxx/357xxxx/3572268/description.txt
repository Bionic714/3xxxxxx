About the game
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action Cyborg is a small retro 2D platform/action-game written in C and SDL by
John Karlgren, and released by Studio Stök. The game is still in it's beta phase
and is to be considered *unfinished* software for the moment. This release
features only a few early levels, but more content is planned to be added as new
versions of the game are released. By the time of release of version 1.0.0,
Action Cyborg should have matured into a full game with complete levels and
content. But for now, that still lies in an unknown future!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The background story
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The story takes place in a dark, technological future, which is actually not
much further away than one or two centuries from now. The improvement of
technology and endlessly expanding powers of mega-corporations has led to a
severe decay of mankind, resulting in people of lower social status living under
more or less miserable circumstances in the unimaginable big cities. The
technology is, however, available to absolutely anyone because of it's cheap
price. Walk right out in the street and you can buy the latest military
technology, computers, synthetic drugs and weapons for a non-important price.
And you will need it, unless you want the next person ending your life just so
he can scavenge on what little you have left.

You play a cyborg (cybernetic organism), a human being who through implants and
technological modifications has had his body and reflexes enhanced for superior
strength and agility. Our hero is not an AI (artificial intelligence) however.
He was once a human being, just like anyone else, before his kalcium-based
skeleton was swapped for solid aluminium, muscles injected with synthetic
steroid hormones, heart exchanged for an electronic pump and eyes replaced with
Sony colour-videolenses. He is not immortal though. His flesh is still sensitive
to heat, and the bullet from a gun would still splice his nervous system and
result in a collapse.

This may not have been something our hero wished for. It is very much possible
that he once suffered a nearly fatal attack on himself, and ended up either
crippled for life or with his brain in a glass jar. And it's very possible that
he would still be there, had he not done this transformation.

Now, positioned in the streets and surroundings of BAMA (the Boston-Atlanta
Metropolitan Axis), aka "The Sprawl", our hero is set out on a vigilantistic
mission of both survival and revenge.

How to play the game
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you launch the executable, you are presented with the title screen and main
menu. Navigate the menu with UP and DOWN arrow keys, and select an option with
ENTER. You can always go back to this menu by pressing ESCAPE after you have
launched a new game.

The in-game controls are very easy. Move the cyborg left and right with the LEFT
and RIGHT arrow keys. Press Z to make him jump, and X to fire the weapon. You
can swap weapons with 1, 2, 3 and 4. You can only swap to a weapon if you have
picked it up, so if you press 2 (for shotgun) and nothing happens, then you need
to find and pick up a shotgun first.

You complete a level by reaching the exit (usually the far right end of the
level), and you are automatically taken to the next level when doing so.

The enemies (everyone but you!) will do their best to stop you from reaching the
exit. They will try to kill you on sight by fireing their weapons at you. You
can respond to this by shooting back and killing them, or you can try to run
past them if you have ran out of ammunition, or if there are too many of them.

Do your best to avoid getting hit by their bullets, or you will take severe
damage. You can find and pick up medkits to restore your health back to normal.
If you get hit by an explosive rocket (fired by enemy cyborgs armed with rocket
launchers), you are instantly killed.

Troubleshooting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action Cyborg is still beta software and far away from bug-free, but is
guaranteed to not contain any code that would seriously damage your computer
or operating system. It does not attempt to access any files outside it's
directory, and neither does it contain any file-altering code, except for the
screenshot function (accessed by pressing F12).

If for some reason the executable doesn't run, please examine the file
errorlog.txt first and see if it has reported something. There could be a file
missing, or you could have unpacked the game in a wrong way. If it still doesn't
work and errorlog.txt reports nothing (or it's not there), then please e-mail me
and inform me of the problem, and of your computer setup and operating system.
