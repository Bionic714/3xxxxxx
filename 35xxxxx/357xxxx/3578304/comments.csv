,drteeth,2006-12-17T02:27Z,Two 'Dreamlands' were released in 2006. Which one is this?
,torrenting,2006-12-17T17:54Z,"drteeth, this is the drama Dreamland: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417614

Picture quality on this one-cd release runs at 608Ă&#x2014;320 resolution and 970 kbps bitrate; overall, looking very nice and clear. Audio is only 122 kbps VBR MP3, but sounds good enough.
