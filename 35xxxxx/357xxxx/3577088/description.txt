Over a career that takes in almost two decades with Dead Can Dance, award-winning movie soundtracks and a series of acclaimed solo and collaborative albums, Lisa Gerrard has established herself as one of Australia's most ground-breaking and in-demand artists. A singer, composer and occasional actress, Lisa brings a vision that is both precise and all-embracing to everything she does.

By the mid-90s, even the ambition of Dead Can Dance was no longer broad enough to encompass Lisa's musical vision. 1995 saw the release of her solo debut, The Mirror Pool, for which she was accompanied by the Victoria Philharmonic Orchestra. Again, it's an album that defies categorisation, causing one impressed but perplexed reviewer to describe it as "ambient, orchestral, folk and new age all at the same time." Duality, a collaboration with Pieter Bourke followed in 1998 and again transcended musical eras and genres. Six years later came the stunningly beautiful Immortal Memory - another joint effort, this time with the Irish composer Patrick Cassidy.
