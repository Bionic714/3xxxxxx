Half way done....



The last 2 week or so, I waited until I had a few seeders before I uploaded the .torrent to other sites. Because, they often say 0 seeds and may discourage newbies to the show/torrent scene.
Also, I found it faster when I only had a few leechers to begin with. After that, it' ok. "
