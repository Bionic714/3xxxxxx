,Robihot,2006-12-04T02:18Z,"Thx for the upload!

Yeah I hear only bad things about FSX, especially with regards to the copters."
,Robihot,2006-12-04T03:38Z,Great little plane but I think the wheelbrakes need a fixin :)
,SkyMorgan,2006-12-04T09:07Z,"I suggest anyone thinking of downloading this read the reviews given at fspilotshop. I am amazed that they are trying to sell this pile of crap for nearly 30 dollars. 
Do yourself a favour and seek out the freeware 'Veneaviones Rockwell Turbo Commander' at avsim.com. It looks, sounds and flys a hell of a lot  better than this bag of shit. 
Thanks for the upload BlackBug but this is certainly not a keeper. "

,takeit69,2006-12-04T17:29Z,"Can anyone help me with making a torrent
I have a lot of fs2004 planes and other goodies
I'm using Azureus, I'd like to give back to the others that have giving to me."
,sparksnmagic,2006-12-06T02:13Z,"I have many, many hours in this 690, and found a much BETTER one on avsim (search for Veneaviones).  I have deleted the FSCharter 690 and do not recommend it if you're looking for a good one.  The Veneaviones 690 looks better and has a better panel.  However, the engines are a bit more powerful than they're supposed to be -- an edit that can be resolved in the aircraft.cfg file."
