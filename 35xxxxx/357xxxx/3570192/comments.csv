,bigal344,2006-12-16T15:29Z,"May be being a bit stupid here but i've unzipped it all and can't get it to start install, i've tried running the setup file but with no results, anyone help a beginner?????"
,yarrmatey,2006-12-18T00:34Z,"BigAl, do you have Daemon Tools?  You might have to use it to run an ISO file or something to get it to install."
,jix66,2006-12-23T20:48Z,Can´t find the serial
[V],thudan,2007-01-02T09:42Z,"Multi-language, går att välja svenska under installationen. ingen serial med nånstans så här har ni en som fungerade för mig: 1045-1416-0661-3310-9893-6271"
,MoxJet,2007-03-07T16:23Z,No problem installing this under Linux using CrossOver Office 6 :-) ( with Swedish language and the key supplied by thudan )

1045-1416-0661-3310-9893-6271 
I didnt find the serial in the package...."
,McFuzzington,2008-12-09T03:01Z,Just though i would register to say that as of now. The serial posted by Thudan wroks still. I didn't download from this torrent but another here on TPB. 
,kithylin,2009-10-11T13:17Z,"Are you people crazy or something?

One file ""Adobe Photoshop 7.0, with serial.exe"" a self-extracting WinZIP File. Right-click on it in windows explorer, ""Extract here"" with winrar, out pops the file ""adobe photoshop 7.0 serial.txt"" with guess what *gasp* the serial number! WOW!

And a sub-folder called ""Photoshop"" which inside is the installer.. just run setup.exe and it installs and works perfectly.

The included serial in ""adobe photoshop 7.0 serial.txt"" works 100%, I don't understand how you guys on here can screw up something so simple. And i'm using windows7 64-bit.

Make sure you DO NOT REGISTER when prompted when you start it."
,Coug-Greg,2009-10-31T17:47Z,merci
,sayangamiey,2009-12-09T04:41Z,"thx for e upload, it works "
,rockman123,2009-12-20T22:23Z,all i need to know is how do you keep adobe from calling home and disabling the software -unable to load for system or hardware failure.it will happen in 
,abrandano,2010-01-02T15:39Z,Works just fine with the added serial. Thanks Pilsken!
[V],rambam1776,2010-01-28T07:31Z,Worked perfectly for me
,phiabell,2010-02-06T00:17Z,"D/l in 3 mins, working perfectly. Great upload, thanks!"
,Mangachaos,2010-03-11T07:51Z,"That took like... 1 min to download. (Get ""real"" networks dudes..:P) Don´t worry though I´ll seed some.. ^_^ 

Ah... gamla adobe 7.0. Säga vad man vill om de nya men denna e enkel och lagom bra även nu för tiden. Jag vägrar byta min version bara för denna duger heh."
,kool4kat,2010-05-08T16:47Z,works great thanks
,bigones,2010-05-19T01:24Z,"Works great, and very easy to navigate the serial along with install."
,TIOF,2010-06-09T07:26Z,What do I do if your not suppose to register? I dont want to use my name but cant install unless I register. Help please!
,oasismiki,2010-06-15T07:42Z,"wow, downloaded in 4 mins :D

the sucky part is that it will not run the set up file for me...i tried numerous times, tried running it as an admin but nothing works.  thanks anyway!"
,oak415,2011-02-08T05:41Z,"Splendid..! You just have to unzip the files into same folder or know how to get to where you unzipped the files at. no daemon tools necessary

1045-1416-0661-3310-9893-6271 "
,oak415,2011-02-08T05:43Z,Just wanted to add this worked for me on a WinXP machine. Have not tested it on Vista or 7
,Ecm1188,2011-12-09T23:41Z,"Worked perfectly for me. If anyone's having problems, you're apparently doing something wrong. Simply unzip the torrent after it's finished & run the Setup.exe file. "
,Fallah,2012-01-08T13:58Z,"Setup doesn't seem to work on Windows 7 64-bit, even with compatibility mode on."
,jstmps,2012-03-23T12:58Z,"Unfortunately the installer doesn't work at all on my Win7 32-bit, the process just hangs there until I kill it. Compatibility modes don't make a difference."
,blues881,2012-03-24T09:34Z,thanks man
