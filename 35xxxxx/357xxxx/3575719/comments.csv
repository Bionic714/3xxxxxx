,astramedial,2006-12-13T12:07Z,"CBR-files are RAR:ed .jpg-files for those that don't know. Rename the ""cbr"" to ""rar"" and unrar. But I highly recommend a cbr viewer."
,ElgerHz,2007-03-06T02:06Z,But why??? What is the point in putting the images in RAR files when jpg files already ARE compressed?!
,Turbis,2008-08-18T05:06Z,ElgerHz: CBR files are used with comic veiwing apps like gonvisor
