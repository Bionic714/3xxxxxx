After watching the majority of his first 'Im Dave Gorman' Experiment i was intrigued to find out what Googlewhacking was all about. And the end result i was presented with was sheer genius working on stage. Although it is hard to comment on the content without giving away too much, Dave Gorman's Googlewhack Adventure takes you on a journey like no other. It all started with an email from a fan referring to his website as having a Googlewhack on it. What is a Googlewhack i hear you cry? A Googlewhack happens when you type any two words (from a dictionary or Google's own online dictionary)press search, and only get ONE result returned. Harder than you'd Expect. When Dave attempts this he finds himself taking an unexpected trip spanning a fair few miles around the world. A fantastic bit of viewing even for those unfamiliar with his work. You'll laugh, you'll cry you'll even cringe at his independent struggle to pursue this random endeavor. Random but Revolutionary. This truly is tale of epic proportions.
