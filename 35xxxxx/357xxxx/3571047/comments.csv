,rotak,2006-12-05T16:31Z,"GO stands for giga octet. Just a different way of saying it. WHAT ARE YOU, SOME KIND OF CONFORMIST?!?!?/"
,slindfors3,2006-12-06T06:37Z,"Weird abbrevation, Giga octet would be 8 000 000 000 of something unspecified then :) I'll stick with my GB ;)"
[T],Knaster,2006-12-06T12:14Z,French just don't like english so they must come up with different words just to show that they are the best ^^
,aitchar,2006-12-06T13:17Z,"it's not that they don't like english, they're still in many ways closet fascists (don't forget >half of them capitulated)

They wish to keep their language 'pure'  so they have to invent words for e-mail and such (despite e-mail being used for years before the acedmie caught up and changing it to courriel and then banning the use of the word e-mail)

Is it any wonder that they nearly voted in the  fascist  lePen instead of their existing corrupt president.

,storegud,2006-12-27T19:39Z,I just wonder if the ppl at playlogic really knows what a great chance they wasted. With a bit more to the storyline and some bug-fixing this could well have come to be one of thoose classics. Now it'll just go into the mist of forgotten games..
,Paltazar,2007-01-12T22:48Z,"Well Mista Jollabro.. if u are so kind to seed some from your brain then... :)

I´ve tried both Mounting with DT and burna dvdcopy.. Install FINE .. move cracks to replace the orig. on my HD.. BETTER.. see something other than that pirate-stopping copyprotect-äshit when I hit .exe.. GREAT..Watch Windows shut the program at startup... quite sad actually.. *sniff*..
So please.. Mr.Jahlabro..tell ""a frustrated sad whining plonker with a taste for anything that has to do with pirates:

NEXT MOVE?"

,o0Gizmo0o,2007-06-19T04:09Z,"Hmm.. I can't delete the files?
I have installed, the image is NOT mounted..

Help!"
,torrentbeast,2007-10-18T13:12Z,"THIS DOESN'T WORK!!! i used crack and dring the loading with picture of ship screen goes black and ""error"" occurs,and windows sends message that there is error and game must be stopped :(. "
,JSAknow,2010-02-15T05:03Z,"About the Engine.exe stuff..
I got the same error all the time, but then I had a look at the error description from windows, and noticed that it said ""Modname: ffdshow""

After that i had the idea that it was coos of an outdated version of ffdshow i had installed.

I went on the net and got the new 2010 ffdshow version and now the game works fully and fine :)

I hope thos maybe can be some kind of help for others :)"
,Justdaany,2010-05-18T22:14Z,Can someone make a torrent of this game for the Mac? So mac users can also play this game? :)
,Da_seed,2010-08-15T15:30Z,"K so i did get just the same errors as u guys. But the way to fix this is just to copy all the !?!? in the crack folder and paste it into to the system folder. No more errors... And if u are one of those that gets an incompatible error from the Star prot, wont get this after pasting all files from the crack folder into ur system folder. And by doing this u wont need a serial key."
,miguelsz3,2010-10-23T06:07Z,Whats with the minimum 1 gb ram?!? I know for a fact you only need like 256 mb to run it

,razkid,2011-04-24T15:42Z,"@Tebura get a crack it works for me :D
u dont need to install the star force"
,Rasoiratomique,2011-04-26T18:27Z,"@slindfors3 : the ""o"" in Mo or Go stands for ""octet"", which is the french word for ""bit"", so mo (mégaoctet) is the french translation of mb (megabit) and go (gigaoctet) is the french translation of gb (gigabit)"
,Ajid_Amoi,2011-06-01T02:38Z,"many corrupted file ..

,Ajid_Amoi,2011-06-03T05:37Z,"Installation Success ..

,goopd,2011-06-19T07:44Z,"yes this game could have been better with more work but its really not that bad

the whole waves messing up ur cannon shots is realistic any captain would have had to deal with that.

and to those complaining about aiming the cannons USE 3rd PERSON mode it auto aims the cannons.

u should also increase ur accuracy skill when u level up bc each level up increases the dmg and accuracy of ur cannons by 3% which makes a huge difference.

u can manually aim in the on-deck view using that circle in the middle of ur screen; i believe u are suppose to shoot when the circle turns red meaning it will hit an enemy.

i recommend using 3rd person view for sea fights and if u want to sink another ship use the bomb shot not the standard cannon shot it does far more dmg.

but yeah this game could have been epic with a little more work especially in the area of land fighting."
,massivetempah,2011-10-08T13:43Z,doesnt work even with crack. loads the intro but crashes on the screen with the ship
