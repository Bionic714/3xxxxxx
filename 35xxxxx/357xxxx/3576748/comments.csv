2. Terminate/close/exit Anapod Manager - iPod from the system tray (Right click > Exit Anapod Manager)
3. copy files from the hack folder to the install dir and overwrite when asked.
4. double click the reg hack file to add content to the registry.
5. Reboot

,Casperius,2006-12-15T20:33Z,With an earlier version you had to close down explorer.exe before clicking the register-key and then open upp explorer.exe again but that didn't work for me with this one either. I hope someone comes up with a solution to this problem soon!  :)
,compccs,2006-12-16T13:46Z,yea same problem... tried that solution too i remember having to close explorer too i think it was 8.9.2 or so .... but yea cant get it to register... itll accept it and say ok but as soon as you open it up again it wants you to register

Any suggestions?"
,Canon77,2007-02-24T18:22Z,"Bought the program. Finally something worth buying!

Köpte detta program från tillverkaren. Åkte på moms dock vilket man kanske undviker om man skriver in att man bor i USA istället för Sverige..."
