,OzSputnik,2006-12-17T06:23Z,"I had this game years ago. It is a very good, almost hidden gem of a turn based strategy game. One of the facets that made it interesting is the way they worked religion into it.  The ""church"" is a very powerful partner that can be a good ally or a ruthless enemy and they are one of the powerful factions you have to negotiate with.

It's a shame there is no seeder for this. I would love to play it again. Why peeps post a torrent and then not seed it I'll never understand."
