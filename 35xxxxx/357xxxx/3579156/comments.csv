,oksam,2008-03-13T01:25Z,"For the key you need to look in the info file...as in the 'NFO' file, as in the serial.nfo file.  Get it?

Open the serial.nfo file with any text editor, such as Word for Windows, Notepad, etc.

If you still can't figure it out, then maybe Carls had a valid point.  We can't actually do this stuff for you.  You have to figure at least a tiny portion of out for yourself.

Good luck."
