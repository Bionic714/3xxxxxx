,Miss Danielle,2006-12-03T22:25Z,Enjoy
,Miss Danielle,2006-12-03T22:26Z,BTW this comes with editors + patch
,Miss Danielle,2006-12-04T02:16Z,Once you have it downloaded would you tell me what you think of it?
,devil_033_here,2006-12-04T07:38Z,thnaks miss but it is crapy......
,Miss Danielle,2006-12-04T22:36Z,Why crappy? Do you mean the game itself? (thats not my fault) or file quality? (could be my fault)
,Miss Danielle,2006-12-06T01:41Z,Oh well... Its seeded by myself  just about constantly... hopfully I get more feedback
,t0ni9000,2006-12-06T03:16Z,"PEOPLE! download this! its absolutly perfect, download, install and ready to go, the best torrent ever, thx danielle"
,Miss Danielle,2006-12-06T03:42Z,Np
,z-the_ant,2006-12-06T19:28Z,Any difference between thos one and the Ultima Edition torrent? That would be save for the filesize. And seeders ^^
,Miss Danielle,2006-12-06T20:56Z,This is just standard FF VII aswell as a patch + a ingame editor program (Dialogues and music and stuff) If you guys wanted I could make the download size smaller and make another torrent for the patch + editors seperate?
,t0ni9000,2006-12-07T07:43Z,"i have a minor problem, sometimes it crashes when my first battle starts! then i get the error, debug, but then it happened in about 2 hours, anyway I can fix it?????"
,IceBlink1,2006-12-08T02:13Z,"ye only made one misstake and that was to take the wrong game to rip... everyone knows this should be played on console not pc :P
id like to see the Suikoden games on here thou :)"
,Miss Danielle,2006-12-08T02:29Z,"t0ni9000 that is a problem with your PC not this game, it runs wonderfully on my computer and I installed it just like you did, unless you messed around editing stuff than it SHOULD be fine."
,t0ni9000,2006-12-08T04:27Z,"ok, maybe i should uninstall it, then install it again, then i installed the xp patch, what does that do???"
,ML88,2006-12-13T18:59Z,"Please seed, can't wait :D"
,Ebriusum,2006-12-13T20:04Z,When i start the game first it gets black then i get the new game/continue screen. Wehn i pick new game it gets black again and stays that way for a long time. I have tried the XP patch but when that is installed the game don't start at all. My guess is that the movies in the game run but don't show or sound ... Any ideas on how i can solve this? 
,tyco24,2006-12-14T04:16Z,"Thanks for this torrent.  Anyway, The game seemingly works fine, but when I get to the screen with the arrow to select Continue or New Game, the game's controls via my keyboard/mouse are unresponsive.  Please Help!"
,Skwert,2006-12-14T10:42Z,"If this works... Im gonna be soo happy, ty Danielle, you made my chrismas:D"
,Ebriusum,2006-12-14T12:29Z,"tyco24: You control the game with the numpad ... (8=up, 4=left, 6=right, 2=down) and soo on. I think  all the controls is stated in a TXT file in the FFVII directory somewhere. 

Anyone knows why i can't seem to play the FMVs so the game is all black, as i stated in my last comment "
,devil_41288,2006-12-14T14:14Z,luuuve the seeding:D thnx
,tyco24,2006-12-14T23:49Z,"Ebriusum:  My laptop compter has no number pad with arrows, only a four direction arrow pad with no numbers involved.  Is there a way to change the control config to match my keyborad?  Or do i just have to connect an external?"
,Jolle107,2006-12-15T13:32Z,"Morons -_- playing this game on PC uh, fat nerds.."
,Beasts and Bumpkins Lover,2006-12-15T17:12Z,"Thnx Miss Danielle, all works fine.


~aXXo rox~"
,ishmail,2006-12-16T17:09Z,umm this is gonna sound retarded but how do i get the game to run after i download it
,Ebriusum,2006-12-17T17:04Z,tyco24: there is a patch you can download to change the controls so it will work on you laptop. Don't know if it is included in this package thou if not just use google and you will find it 
,Miss Danielle,2006-12-18T04:16Z,I run on a radeon 9800 and it plays perfectly for me mess around with your catalyst control center and it should turn out good
,Colonel80,2006-12-23T12:20Z,how do we download it?

"
,ninjafootballer,2007-01-20T05:37Z,"help! i dled everything...i think, but it says some MIDI thing cant be found that it needs a Windows   95 compliant device"
,Moonlight-Rain,2007-01-20T07:45Z,"The  graphics ironically look nicer on the PSone..only the characters look better on the PC... But the best part of the game is the backgrounds... fighting scene backgrounds look nic eon the pc..but the other backgrounds, and the FMV's look better on the Psone version... it has to do with the higher resolution bringing out the not so sharp lines in the beckgrounds that were really made to be seen on a TV which isn't any where near as detailed as the image produced by a computer monitor.
And I recommend a controller...this game isn't really made for a keyboard and mouse.
So it's much better experience if you use a control pad of some sort."
,bærnt,2007-01-24T05:05Z,"I lost sound after i left Midgar for the first time.not the effects,just the music.does someone know what the problem could be?
Its frustrating because i realy like this game."

I double clicked the .exe, and everything runs fine, but then it asks me to ""insert disc 1"", and so on. What is it that I should be doing at this point in time? Can anybody help, please?


Thank you for the download, Miss Danielle. "
,Apec,2007-07-01T02:11Z,"OK everyone i downloaded this and it DOES WORK... i have a vista machine and it crashed often on there :( i then put it on a XP machine and it works fine (note, make sure u install the included patch FF7 1.03) (the reunion patch i don't like) and for all the people who were knocking on this game saying it looked like crap, you shouldn't be playing the game. this is by far the best RPG ever made and i am so glad they made it for computer. another note the controls by default are the NUM PAD, so you will probably want to change that ASAP. (if this is the first you are gunna play this game dont download go buy for PS1, it is much better the first time on PS1) Great Game hope you all injoy:)  "

,Insanityandme,2007-08-17T13:35Z,Seed plx!
,rejay,2007-08-27T17:46Z,"Okay, this is a recommendation for those who want to playFinal Fantasy7 and end up in the beginning of the game with a blackscreen. Is it a problem with your PC? NO its not. Is it a problem with the game? Most likely not.The main issue becauseof the black screen is the fact that your computer can't playthe games movies. ANY MOVIES AT ALL in the game will result in a black screen. If it happens during gameplay, all the characters will be there but the screenbackground will go black. I was just like anyoneelse who had this problem. Trying everything you can justto play this AWESOME game,if the patches does not work,

(I literally LOL to those people who try to solve this problem by asking for your pc spec's and start blabbling on and on about meaningless solutions and pointless questions, jesus christ what a waste of time)

So, I recommend downloading this 

http://www.free-codecs.com/download/ACE_Mega_CoDecS_Pack.htm

And click the ""TrueMotion2 video decoder 2.0.6.2b."" when they give you a checklist (DONT JUST SKIMTHROUGH THE INSTALLATION!!) Its in Fliters. The List is arranged alphabetically, so FILTERS shouldn't be too hard to find.

Although, there is some side effects to this program, your video players wont play good, I have no idea how fix this issue or to avoide it so dont ask me. But hey at least you get to play FF7!

well, afterwords, if you want to play your video players again, download this and uninstall the ACE Mega CodecS pack ( wont be able to play FF7 if you do this):

http://www.cccp-project.net/under the following system you use. if it asks to disable any filters at the beginning of the installation do so, unless you have a good reason not to.

good luck"

so then i clicked the raphael jones patch, it didnt have any instruction so i simply opened up the rar file name 'ff7100', in it i clicked the ms-dos applicaiton, then clicked the registry file....after that, i managed to get past the error message, but it was loading very slowly, and the screen was jittery...after clicking new game, i would usually get a blank screen.

i read a few messages on here, regarding the video codes, on of them sai that for it to work, you have to uninstall all your codecs and leave just truemotion (orwateva the name is)

so thats what i did...and low and behold...IT WORKED !!!!

it works fine, i reinstalled by codecs, and even tho it still starts up fine...when you get in game, you wills till get black screend (the first bit where barret and cloud get off the train)

so there you have it, if you want it to work...simply uninstlal all your video codes (i had k-lite)

but...i still have 1 little problem.

everytime i minimize, then go back to FF...in my next battle, the screen freeze, then i get an error...

i tried installing the xp patch, it prompts you to put in disc 1 , 2o 3...but if you mount the iso file located in the 'goodies' folder, correctly....then it should work (read the readme, you have to open the regedit file in notepad, then edit the datadrive, to 'f:')

even with the xp patch tho, i still get the annoying error...


so, so far FF7 works fine (im still only 10 minutes into game)...but with two sacrifices...

1. no porn or movies for the tiem being, seeing as i have no codes to watch them (VLC player will do for now i guess)

2. you cant minimize while you play.

i can live with both for now, but if anybody has any solution for these two little problems, it would be greatly appreciated.

also thanks alot to the people who gave the info/help, regarding the black screen/codec issues, it helped.

,samories,2008-07-19T06:51Z,"In some cases the movies will not play when you start the game. If that is the case for you, then download and install the TrueMotion 2.0 Codec. It will just install in a second, and then the movies should play fine.

link -> http://codec.alshow.co.kr/Down/tm20decSetup.exe

Also, some movie codecs will conflict with the Final Fantasy 7 movie playback, notably the K-Lite Codec Pack. If you have that installed the only option is to uninstall those movie codecs, unfortunately."

,sorlark,2008-09-09T14:09Z,"Ok guys. I fought with this program for a while, I was having difficulties with it, namely the backgrounds had squares on them during gameplay but not in the battle scenes. I tried a lot of different things, until I noticed something. When you right click and choose the compatibility tab, you can change that. Which is what I did first and it didn'thelp. I then noticed the button at the bottom. "" show settings for all users "" THAT is where you need to make the change to windows 95 or 98. I only have one account on this laptop, but it just won't recognize that fact that I am the admistrator account. 

All you have to do is what I posted above. I didn't have to install any patches except with what came on the installer. i didn't even use the XP patch at ALL. Good luck, I hope this helps."

The PSX version is far superior and if you use an emulator like ePSXe, you can play in higher resolutions and utilise your graphics card better.

The bog-standard unchangeable resolution of the PC version is 640 x 480... it looks awful."

For people who want to play in a HIGHER RES, you can use the OPENGL DRIVER, or if your card isn't capable, the HIGH RES patch from here:

http://wiki.qhimm.com/FF7/Technical/Customising

My advice is to just download unmodified copies of the game ISOs, and apply the patches that are compatible with each other yourself:

All the racing minigames go ultra fast.

What that means is that when I'm doing the motorcycle escape from midgar it looks like I'm using hyper mode with an emulator, everything moves in fast-forward speed and it's completely impossible to control the bike. 

Same thing happens when I play the gold saucer roller coaster minigame. It's speeded up like crazy and there's no way to control it.

Any ideas? My guess is that it's a video issue but I can't imagine what it could be."
