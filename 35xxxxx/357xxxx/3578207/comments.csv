Here?s how to fix it:

    * Go to Applications folder

,Takenlastsunday,2007-07-18T08:23Z,Does this work on Windows OS?
,noyfb,2007-08-11T18:39Z,"This is not the full install it is the 4.5 update cd.
You install 4.0 then 4.5 plus you have to install all the components manually. At first glance you can not tell if the application is in English cause of the asian folder text."
,northbeachfilms,2007-09-08T02:10Z,"hope this reaches the right person! thank you for your help in getting FCP 4.0 to run on my macbook pro. what can i say, replacing AGP with PCI worked perfectly, and your instructions were easy to understand. caitlin maynard, north beach films.

,NxtPh3n0m,2009-06-17T06:46Z,"Alright so if you are having a problem with the AGP thing here is what to do.

First go to FCP and get package contents>Contents>info.plst

Open it up and hit command f and search AGP and it should show up about 10-12 lines down.

Next try to replace it with the letters PCI and this may work

If that doesn not work then go back and select the line That used to say AGP (it may say PCI if you changed it) then you select the line containing those three letters and the line above it and DELETE THEM.  make sure there is not an empty line in where you deleted the Lines.

Congratulations You have just CORRECTLY installed FCP HD 4.5 on a mac!!!!!!! "
,venkatesh_bashetty,2009-12-29T07:30Z,"Hey cdelaire,

does this software works in Windows 7 ?..."
,sk_tamilan,2010-07-07T01:09Z,to all of those who are asking if it ll work on windows the answer is NO! it won't it was only made to work for MAC OS!
,nithin862001,2010-12-30T19:26Z,is there any windows versions for final cut?
,biscuit11,2011-03-13T12:33Z,"Ok, my problem is this. Just brought a Macbook Pro - does this torrent work on Mac Laptops?

Because I'm getting this error message. (I have already taken the advice of the previous comments and fixed the AGP thing):

CONFIGURATION ERROR

This software requires certain hardware or software is missing.

*Power Macintosh g4/350 megahertz (MHz) or faster."
,biscuit11,2011-03-13T12:45Z,"Also guys, I'm really fucking worried about the registration process, surely if I register this product with the cracked serial no.s given, Apple are going to find me out and charge and fine me!

Can I register this without serial no's? Is it safe to register these serial no's?"
,biscuit11,2011-03-13T12:56Z,"By the way, if I don't end up in prison thanks to that registration process. (Thanks for the in depth instructions 'cdelaire')

I solved my own problems with the following warning:

CONFIGURATION ERROR

This software requires certain hardware or software is missing.

*Power Macintosh g4/350 megahertz (MHz) or faster.

First go to FCP and get package contents>Contents>info.plst

(You get that by holding the 'control' key while clicking on the program icon of FCP by the way, you'll see a drop down box with a list of options, choose 'show package contents')

and find any lines that read 'G4' or '350' and delete them, making sure not to leave a space where you've just deleted. 

So it's just like the solution to AGP problem."
