,stinger839,2008-02-19T21:01Z,"A must-see DVD for Iron Maiden fans. 

I am a ""forever seed"" on this file, so if the tracker says 0 seeds, it is not hopeless. I usually have it running, but if I don't and you've been waiting a bit, email me: stinger839 at gmail"
,warriorinc,2009-06-30T21:20Z,ok I have ISO how I burn it a DVD-R can anyone tell me?
,warriorinc,2009-07-02T13:14Z,Ok I got it on DVD and Blueray now its ok... Thanks alot dude I bought this DVD now I can watch the making of A Matter of Life and Death again thanks up the irons...
,warriorinc,2009-07-02T13:17Z,I'll be seeding this one for awhile so other Blood Brothers can have the pleasure of watching the DVD. Too Bad Iron Maiden Holdings LTD won't re-release this epic CD/DVD set. Maybe it will be added to the Early Days series I have Part I & Part II already...
