,Todde@Swe,2006-12-05T18:07Z,What is OEM?
,ehagglun,2006-12-05T21:46Z,"What is OEM, oh Lord...
OEM - Original Equipment Manufacturer...

OEM is for instance, when you buy a computer with Windows Pre-Installed. Then you have an OEM license.

Next time you have a question like this, don't direct it to piratebay, try Google instead."
