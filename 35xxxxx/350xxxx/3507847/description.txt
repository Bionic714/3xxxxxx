These are the best I could find. 
What I mean is, all are scanned nicely, really clear. 
They open and scroll well - some I came accross didn't. 
They open to fill the full window of Acrobat or Foxit - others didn't.

They are all full issues - they are not articles/sections taken from various issues.

I put this up a few minutes ago but named it incorrectly ( it was 'Shopnotes issues 21 - 30 - Very Good Quality'). 21 - 30 is 217.8 MiB whereas 51 - 60 (this file) is 228.36 MiB.

Sori, first time offering torrents.

PS. How do I remove 'bad' torrents?
