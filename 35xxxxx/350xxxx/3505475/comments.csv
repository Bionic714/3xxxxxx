,nil7,2006-07-21T18:04Z,"Well, I have it, so maybe some other time :-). But IMHO it sucks compared to SFC2. They simplified the combat in SFC3. It became to arcade like; you don't quite get the ""huge ship, lot of subsystems"" battle feeling.

SFC2 have a more advance combat system with more attack/defend options and things to control. But SFC3 do have a few nice innovations; e.g. warp, reverse and ""angular velocity"". "
,Sarge Is,2006-09-09T10:13Z,Is Starfleet Command 3 better then Starfleet Command 2?
,nil7,2006-09-13T19:36Z,"That depends on your definition of ""better"". If you mean easier and simpler with slightly better graphics - then yes.

If on the other hand you want a more advance game, with more powerfull weapons where a very large ship *can* and *will* obliterate small ships in seconds - then no, in that case SFC2 is ""better"" than SFC3. As I tried to explain in my prevous post, they made the game more arcade-like by reducing the tactics. For me, SFC3 doesn't feel like an ""upgrade"" to SFC2, but more like a ""new game based on the same idea"".

In SFC3 the largest ship can not take down a small ship easily. The games are to ""weighted"" for my taste. 

One example: In SFC2, when a weapon takes damage, it stops working until repared. This goes for both you and the enemy. In SFC3, they must have thought that dead weapons could discourage players, and so damaged weapons only blinks and then goes back online at reduced power.

This may sound like ""ok"" if you haven't tried it, but it goes both ways, so consider this: When you finally get all your heavy plasma torps aligned for a perfect shot through a damaged shield - what will you prefere? (SFC2): That the enemy takes a satisfying amount of damage that effectively removes all of his weapons pointing towards you... Or (SFC3): His weapons flashes a couple of times and goes online again after which he fires back at you...

I prefere the first. If you don't mind, try SFC3...

This is of course my personal opinion, based on I've bought and played both games - but I've always reverted back to SFC2 :-) That said, there are some new features in SFC3 I really miss in SFC2...

,Plasmafox,2006-10-03T21:39Z,I have'nt yet played 2 or 3 but i remember loving the original! Props for taste.
,Plasmafox,2006-10-03T21:42Z,"sry for double but just in case you didn't take the time to look through the files, in original game there was a file called shipdat.txt or something- containing the unencoded ship attributes that the game read. again, haven't checked two for this yet but if it's there, happy cheating ;3"

""Edit the desktop shortcut to point to the correct .exe and make sure the ""Start in"" folder is correct in the shortcut properties.""

,CJArtists,2007-11-21T01:40Z,"The main game file works fine, but take care with the ""patches"".  One of them seems to have a trojan load for advertising software."

,Archiballd,2011-07-15T11:43Z,"nil7 exacly you have point

Every one have different taste ( sorry for my english)

For me sfc2 its 10 times beter from sfc3 
sfc3 its  i dont now not easy but less embedded in reality  even in hard mode we see trick like nil7 wrote earlier 
may be is more options in multiplayer  .. you can shot more disregarding an damage wapons but for me its lame
1 more time  sory  for my englis its not my language
I greet all star trek fans "
