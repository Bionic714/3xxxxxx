This is a very horrible sad and depressing TRUE STORY, which makes it even worse to view. Kirstie Alley,(Brenda Geck),"Back by Midnight",'02, put her heart and soul into this horrible role and made you hate her over and over again. Will Patton,(Philip Rothman),"The Agency",'01 TV Series, acted his usual calm ways and was soft spoken, but very powerful in his building a case against Brenda Geck. It is a shame that such a person did exists and did so much mental and physical harm too so very many people's lives. It is a great film to alert the general public as to what can actually happen in their own neighborhoods or even your next door friend. It was nice to see Kirstie Alley give such a great performance in this very sick TRUE STORY!
