,uXs,2008-04-28T15:32Z,"@enflure: There is no such thing as a 'good quality'-mp3. 
As a way to convert the fools and non-believers: download Crescendolls, track number 5 from 'Daft Punk - Discovery' both in FLAC and MP3. Prepare to never download MP3 again, viva la FLAC revolution!"
,T3MUL3NT,2008-05-02T18:35Z,FLAC is shit :)
,T3MUL3NT,2008-05-02T18:38Z,"So is ANYONE going to seed this or what? I'm getting two people giving me 1 kb/sec each, this is pathetic. Stupid kids download this shit and then dont seed. Greedy faggots."
