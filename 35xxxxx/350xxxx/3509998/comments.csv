,FSSR.Keyno,2006-08-07T04:45Z,"FSDude, maybe because it cant find what its looking for(on you HD)Like the torrent(not the file).
Keep trying, that how i did it."
,luke97,2006-08-07T09:48Z,"So, I suppose this is New Spanish Airports 2004 but is its latest CD version (v.3.0). ThereÂ´s only two Spanish Airports products: Vols. 1 and 2. Vol.2 includes Sevilla, Granada, Reus, Girona etc.
Tnx Winnie"
