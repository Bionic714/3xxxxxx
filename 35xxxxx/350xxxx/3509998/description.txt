New Spanish Airports is a combination of the simWings airports that cover the biggest airports in Spain. 9 (!) high detail airports Madrid, Barcelona, Malaga, Alicante, Almeria, Jerez, Valencia, Pamplona and Santander. 

As with all airports done by sim-wings these airports walk the fine line between usability (framerates) and super detail. But they know how to stay on the good side of the line and their airports and surroundings are highly optimized to allow the level of detail they are known for. From the terminals done in high definition photograpic textures, to the small objects that make airports come to life.
