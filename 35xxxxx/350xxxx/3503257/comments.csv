,Ohrstrom,2006-07-16T11:58Z,Is the original version of this song this crappy in quality?  Everytime the chorus goes on it sounds like someone has a large fan next to my ears..

Idont know what you mean ta de p책 svenska"
,Hell Haxxor|SWE,2006-07-17T05:20Z,">Your fucking fuck Face.

,CinEmaS,2007-11-28T02:22Z,"If Didz rather take the album, why is he here?"
,Wieeeeeee,2008-07-11T21:27Z,"You hear the crackle, but it adds a nice dimension to the track, since I heard the song the first time on the radio, which led me to search for it here...

Thanks."
