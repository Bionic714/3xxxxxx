,zmarathon,2006-07-12T10:26Z,"there are 2. the first one is the month before olympia 2005 and the second one is after, ending in december 2005."
,majtymicke,2006-07-15T22:14Z,How about letting us in on the bitrate on your rip? I have downloaded several other BB videos that had lousy bitrate = unwatchable
