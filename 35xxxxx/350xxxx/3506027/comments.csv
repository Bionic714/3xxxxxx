They have lots of mods, i.e. user created songs. Stick with fruityloops ppl. Trying to make music with this thing is like... hard. Check it on youtube to get an idea of what I'm talkin about :) "
,bongodaddy,2008-06-12T19:00Z,"oooh this is the one i used in the 90:s.. but the radium release

fruityloops is overrated"
,kidknapp,2009-01-01T16:49Z,"Check out this repack off of the Propellerhead originals- It has all Songs, Mods, the midi yoke and the pattern editor.

For those who think its too hard? Everything we don't know seems too hard until we learn and understand it at which point it becomes simple. If making music was so easy than there wouldn't be anything special about it. Walk away and go back to an 'easy' program, but you'll only be cheating yourselves...."

What the fuck is up with that?"
