`Das Boot` is a graphic and gripping tale that follows the daring patrol of U-96, one of the famed German U-Boats known as `The Grey Wolves`. Prowling the North Atlantic, they challenged the British Navy at every turn. The crew aboard the U-96 is portrayed in a desperate life-and-death struggle, coping with endless hours of claustrophobic boredom at sea, which quickly gives way to terror when confronting the enemy.

Originally nominated for six Academy Awards┬½, this is director Wolfgang Petersen`s ultimate version of one of the most critically acclaimed war movies of all time. An all-new restoration with over one hour of additional footage and a completely new stereo soundtrack that delivers the theatrical experience to your home, this is `Das Boot: The Director`s Cut`.

"An epic journey into joy, passion, compassion and shock. It will blow you away! It`s the film I always wanted to make. The perfect `Das Boot` " - Wolfgang Petersen.
