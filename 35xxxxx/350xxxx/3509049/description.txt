Azumanga Daioh (Complete DVDRIP, Dual Audio)
Ripped them myself from a 6-set of ISO files I found on Mininova of the American release box set - dont worry; you can select Japanese audio + English subtitles if you want them.

Comes with both English and Japanese audio and English subtitles.
Make sure you know how to open and view MKV files.
