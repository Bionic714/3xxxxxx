,OmegaDragon,2006-11-02T20:45Z,"Hmm the subs arnt working for me on any ep that i've finished DL'ing yet.... I'm using the latest Zoom Player and it works on other things so i think the files themselves might be broken :(

Still plays both audio fine though so as long as you dont mind not having a clue what the kanji translates as just watch it in english and you should be good to go :)"

,e_p_o,2007-04-24T17:25Z,"Why can't I download the last three episodes? I've been stuck at 98,2% with those for weeks now even though there's always lots of seeders."
,Sheeters,2008-01-10T17:05Z,Seed plz.
,ozc,2009-01-06T05:50Z,"Uploaded 2006-08-01???

old old old

I think its time to let this one die and hope someone makes a fresh rip."
,slackbear,2009-07-20T13:38Z,Still no link to a new rip with a correct episode 5?
,ozc,2011-02-21T00:58Z,"This set is from KM (Kzubs now) and they are glitchy as fuck and have the wrong subs in ep5. 

a4e (anime 4ever) has a dual audio set on IRC thats not glitchy or packed with incorrect subs. However they used two different versions of DIVX and some of their videos are larger/upscaled for whatever reason. 

There is another version I've been looking for that was encoded by hatchan (qc by bookimp). They're mixed in with Vision-Anime's release so I think their sources were stolen. 

FFS it would be nice if someone uploaded a proper damn dual audio rip of this anime using the current x264 codec!"
,kouta55,2012-07-09T23:12Z,"if you want subs for ep 5 download this http://www.allsubs.org/subs-download/azumanga-daioh-2-6-2002-eng-1-4-3-5/2555047/ 
and you're good to go :)"
