,Tri_Motor,2006-07-15T06:52Z,"Thanks, one slight problem... in this release the gauge.cab and panel.cfg  have a modified date prior to 7-13-06... ""AS"" screwed up and forgot to include the center moving map gauge... so they re-updated the 2 files on 7-13-06... so you won't see the effects of the update in this release."
,rrodger99,2006-07-15T08:31Z,"Bah


I will see about getting the updated files.

No guarantees though."
,Tri_Motor,2006-07-15T09:17Z,"Ok rrodger99 thanks... apparently the ""AS"" F-117 uses the same moving map gauge... so if you have the F117 installed, the problem won't show up.... but if you have just the V22 installed, there's no moving map gauge in the center console... I logged onto the Forum to get the specifics."
,rrodger99,2006-07-15T09:57Z,I have a different F-117 installed...if anyone has the AS F-117117 now would be a good time to post it...:-)
,rrodger99,2006-07-15T16:07Z,"Thanks for the help Bob

,rrodger99,2006-07-15T16:08Z,"Oh yea,

& Tri_Motor too

Good eye there."
,Tri_Motor,2006-07-15T18:42Z,"LoL... thanks  bobdaslob / rrodger99... it seems to be working know, I may have put the .cab file in the wrong folder, but all is good now, and I didn't have the AS-F117 so all was not in vein"
