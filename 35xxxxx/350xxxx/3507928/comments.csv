Tack för att du lägger upp hd-material - den marknaden kommer att explodera inom kort gissar jag."
,_-WoK-_,2006-07-29T16:50Z,"This is heavy! Is there any torrent or place on the web that gives a small sample of 1080p video?
I'm not so sure that my computer can handle this resolution so it would be better to try before downloading 26GB. ^^"
,MisterPresident,2006-08-15T15:13Z,www.apple.com/trailers and search for HD
,theofys,2006-09-20T18:51Z,"May i know what is the aspect ratio ? If it's 2.35:1, then I wouln't want to download it. What's with the black borders at the top and bottom in movies nowadays ? 
"
,andre321,2006-11-05T00:58Z,"Format:    16:9
it says above lol"
,kanetrain,2006-11-20T04:45Z,"The black bars on the top and bottom of the screen are to fill the empty space around the original aspect ratio of the movie (as filmed). Most movies that do not have those ""black bars"" have been formatted to show only the largest possible portion of the picture possible in 4:3 (TV aspect), which in the case of a 2.35:1 movie is about half of the originally intended picture."
,mattey9,2007-02-11T11:35Z,"HI there!

One question?

How do u burn this on a DVD? 

which files are required besides the 4G file"
,mattey9,2007-02-11T11:39Z,"As u know there r around seven 4G files along with a few smaller files, so which files do i include in burning these seven 4G files into DVDs?"
,andreasXPS,2007-02-19T12:06Z,Please seed more! 
,Firesnake2007,2007-08-26T12:03Z,"Well you can burn those 4GB files to DVDs OR you can convert it all to a ~8GB x264 rip so the whole thing fits a DVD9. See doom9.org for details on how to encode to x264.

Thanks a lot 'HDTV CHINA'! Any word on LOTR:ROTK EE 1080p?"
,Firesnake2007,2007-08-26T12:10Z,"Nevermind I found your ROTK EE 1080p torrent on isohunt, thanks!"
,RTRTRTRTRTRT,2008-04-15T05:04Z,anyone have the torrent for the HDTV CHINA Return of the King Extended version?
,Pirate_Kock,2008-04-20T21:10Z,"Does VLC media player work with these files? 
 I hope it's worth downloading this, compared to the other 7 gb version. (dts-sound on this, I think the picture won't make difference)"
,RTRTRTRTRTRT,2008-04-22T00:54Z,"doesn't work for me on vlc. 
mplayer works fine tho"
,Pirate_Kock,2008-04-26T07:33Z,"Can it possibly go slower? I'm downloading at 30-60 kbs for several days now... 5 out of (6) seeds, I don't really understand why this download is so slow.   "
,LionsShare,2009-06-17T22:56Z,"Just finished watching all 3 of these LOTR on a 46 inch 1080p sharp lcd and it looks AMAZING! Have previously viewed them on smaller screens, but seeing them in 46 inches, the detail is just incredible!  All the smaller encodes are from this file, so just spend the time to download this original large file and you will not regret it!"
