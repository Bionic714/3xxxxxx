,Khun T,2006-08-02T18:32Z,Uploading but not seeding ????
,Jackass Jimm,2006-08-06T04:18Z,"This is a ""on and off"" kind of thing.  I've managed to download the first 6 torrents and am ""stuck"" at 44% in the 7th.  Going to start this one now.  I Upload all of them whenever I'm on (I'm barely downloading anything else because I'm using my time on this instead).  But I can only upload so much (384 down/256 up) and where I live, there are 2 blackouts every day, so...

The uploader (davethenave) seeds, it just takes him a long time to seed.  he most probably downloads stuff and leaves these hanging.  But don't worry, at least he will upload them.

Only thing you can do is at least leave any other torrents from this series (disks 1 - 8) seeding, as I do (even though it only usually uploads in 2 of them), to help everyone out.

Hope you continue seeding and posting the whole series of movies, Davethenave."
,Jackass Jimm,2006-09-17T00:48Z,"well, davethenave seems to have abandoned us all...i'll seed a bit more but anincomplete torrent just plain sucks."
,davethenave,2007-02-05T01:39Z,"If you couldn't find this one before try again. Lost internet connection for a few months. Sorry. Doing the best I can.  
All 25 lessons are going up.    Only take the mp4 torrents."

This video course is much better than the Live class offered by TEFLINTERNATIONAL.

Thanks to Dave Hopkins for lending the DVD's.

Without his help this posting of the course would not be possible."

Same as above - sent through GSpace in files approx 9meg, split using GSplit, with an *.exe that will recompile them when all finished dowloading.

enquiriesTEFL@googlemail.com

As suggested to me by davethenave, I've set up some accounts just to keep these files in, then I can easily send them to others, or download them to any computer with Internet access! Works for me!! (you'll need 3 accounts if this is what you want to do, too!!)

If you are using Utorrent as your file share, highlight each file, double click then paste the above trackers.

The video course torrent files were created more than a year ago. It only has one tracker for pirate bay and is no longer recommended. Add all of the above trackers will make a big difference for connected peers and download speed.

,daveshelper,2008-01-06T03:40Z,"Thank you:

All who  seed this series of 25 disk. It's a long list and large files.

I'm asking your help. 

Please... After you complete a download Leave it to seed until a couple more people can take your place.

I've tried off and on for more than a year to make this teaching course available.

This is my last run. 

I'll be off the net in a couple of weeks. 

It's up to you whether these torrents live or die."
