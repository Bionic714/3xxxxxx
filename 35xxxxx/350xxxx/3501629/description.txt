After an almost fatal skydiving accideent, Jamie Sommers becomes the world\'s first Bionic Woman. This is done at the request of her fiance, \'Six Million Dollar Man\' Steve Austin, to OSI head Oscar Goldman, to save her using the bionic surgery that saved him. Unfortunately, Jaime\'s body rejected her first set of Bionics 
& subsequently died. However, Dr.\'s Wells & Marchetti brought her back to life and replaced her failing Bionics with newer ones which worked fine. After the operation Jamie took a teaching job at a Naval base but becomes an agent for the Office Of Scientific Investigations (OSI) when needed.
