,Massmordaren,2006-07-30T13:10Z,"It was me spending a few lines about netiquette in my second last torrent, belga1.
I'm happy you agree with me - we may be pirates, but we certainly aren't rude!"
,belga1,2006-07-30T15:43Z,"Thank you very much luke..great sermon and partially true.

Yes indeed many ppls here showing their low level of education.My parents learn me manythings..first one is to tell thank you when I receive something...and second one is when I receive a slap onmy face..to give two in return.. :).  That was the Belga1 sermon."
,The_Hangar_18,2006-07-30T15:47Z,"And why did u flame so much, belga? Did u learn it from ur parents, too?"
,Massmordaren,2006-07-31T01:40Z,"No one has flamed, and there is no need for such a hostile attitude.

The thing is, if we Pirates ever hope to obliterate the oppressive copyright laws, we must not allow ridiculous disputes to escalate due to rude behavior!"
