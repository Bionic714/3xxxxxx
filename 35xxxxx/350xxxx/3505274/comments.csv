,Jackass Jimm,2006-08-06T04:25Z,"Help seed this guys.  

DSL 24/7 doesn't mean he has a 4.5 down/1.5 up connection.  It means he might have a slow connection and he can only spread this a few times.  

I'm trying to help but considering the amount of people that have downloaded this (around 20) there should be more then 0 - 2 seeders at a time.

Help spread these files. "
,Jackass Jimm,2006-09-17T00:57Z,"Davethenave has left us to fend for ourselves and most probably won't upload anymore (he left disk 7 at 47% and disk 8 at 6%)...

I am growing weary of uploading constantly. I've been uploading since June. So, I'll be stopping my seeding of this series (disk 1 - 6) on September 31st. Seriously, no one seeds here. I think there was a time when I saw like 2 other seeders...for like half a week.

Well, anyway, just wanted to inform you...so make sure you put as much priority into these torrents."

This video course is much better than the Live class offered by TEFLINTERNATIONAL.

Thanks to Dave Hopkins for lending the DVD's.

Without his help this posting of the course would not be possible."

Same as above - sent through GSpace in files approx 9meg, split using GSplit, with an *.exe that will recompile them when all finished dowloading.

As suggested to me by davethenave, I've set up some accounts just to keep these files in, then I can easily send them to others, or download them to any computer with Internet access! Works for me!! (you'll need 3 accounts if this is what you want to do, too!!)

If you are using Utorrent as your file share, highlight each file, double click then paste the above trackers.

The video course torrent files were created more than a year ago. It only has one tracker for pirate bay and is no longer recommended. Add all of the above trackers will make a big difference for connected peers and download speed.

,daveshelper,2008-01-06T03:35Z,"Thank you:

All who  seed this series of 25 disk. It's a long list and large files.

I'm asking your help. 

Please... After you complete a download Leave it to seed until a couple more people can take your place.

I've tried off and on for more than a year to make this teaching course available.

This is my last run. 

I'll be off the net in a couple of weeks. 

It's up to you whether these torrents live or die."
