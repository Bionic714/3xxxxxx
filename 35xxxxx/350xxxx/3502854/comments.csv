How exactly did you manage to get this film into a dvd? This is not rar-files?"
,phatmatt0221,2006-08-03T20:44Z,cant unpack looks like unfinished any tips
,arlowe,2006-08-05T02:23Z,"I have it. Open the Winrar program. Click on the Wizard. When it opens, Choose Wizard. Then Choose ""Unpack an Archive"". Then select the first file with the dvdr.001 ending. Then choose a destination folder. Then click Finish. It will extract an .IMG file which you can unpack with Undisker. Hope this helps."
,North,2006-08-10T10:22Z,"right click the .001 file and open with winrar, extract to any place and you will get a .img file. rename it to .iso and open in nero, recorder->burn image click the file and then burn."
