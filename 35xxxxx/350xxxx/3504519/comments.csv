,Twilight99,2006-07-18T13:22Z,"DVDR is direct copy of a DVD, or where the movie is compressed to fit on a standard DVD disc.

A DVDRip is a movie compressed to Xvid (usually), and does not play on regular DVD-players."
,mpoit957,2006-07-18T14:25Z,PAL or NTSC?
[T],DasBot,2006-07-18T14:42Z,Ripping does not necessary also mean encoding to e.g. XviD. I would define ripping as the process of copying the audio/video from one media e.g. a DVD to the harddrive.

DVDR is direct copy of a DVD, or where the movie is compressed to fit on a standard DVD disc. ....ITS A DISNEY CARTOON....PERFECT COPY...ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS...USE A ISO PROGRAM TO OPEN THE FILE...THEN BURN IT TO A BLANK DVD....AND YOU WILL HAVE A PERFECT COPY OF ALADDIN.....WITH MENUS AS WELL...
