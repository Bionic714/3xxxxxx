,Installarion,2007-01-02T21:22Z,"Yes, with risk of sounding like a noob:

What do I do with all these files? I haven't found one installer at all ('cept NetTumbler) and I have no idea what to do with these. I was sorta imagining a program that, like, did the hacking for you.. (that sounded SOOOOOOO noob, didn't it?)

Yeah, so if anyone could tell me what to do with this, thanks!"
