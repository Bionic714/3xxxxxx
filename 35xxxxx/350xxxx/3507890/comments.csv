[V],Lillis89,2006-08-28T23:07Z,"Kaptenclabbe kan sluta gnälla och ladda upp det han ska och tacka Rawern. Allt blir mycket bättre om man tackar istället för att gnälla. Varför, kan inte Kaptenlandkrabba inte ta och ladda upp något själv för? Sökte lite men bara sno och inte ge!"
,catrina alexandru,2006-10-13T19:50Z,"yo i need to know when we going to download other movies with van damme.

,jackjack999zz,2011-05-24T15:38Z,"quality is really really crap, worse than my much used VHS one, also, he says it's uncut... but it is CUT... and not only cut, but cut down to 93 minutes, 4 minutes shorter than the already cut 97 minute version. I could have gotten a much better one at less than 500mb, what is with the 3.86gb??"
