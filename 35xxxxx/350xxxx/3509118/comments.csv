,azidtrip,2006-08-17T05:33Z,I am the ONLY one seeding. GIMME A F BREAK GREEDY PEOPLE. If you WANT it then HELP OUT. I suggest PB start banning ips not seeding at least 300%. Force them like many other sites does....alternatively login to download with rules to follow.
,comeonnowforgodssakes,2007-02-28T14:17Z,whatever you are looking for this crap isn't it. you get no cronological listing and there is only seven short films. download something else..

if the uploader complains then dont upload.

piratebay is leechers paradise and no one would upload anything or download so much if it was registery to even upload or download.

you upload with your own FREE WILL no one forces you or? :P

and what i see it is not azidtrip  who is the iploader it is SILVIA so STFU!!! 

damn. the seeders who really seed are doing their bests. argh."
