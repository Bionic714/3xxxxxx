Sinopsis: 
It's slaphappy laughs in the great outdoors as Goofy demonstrates his "atheltic prowess" in THE ART OF SKIING and HOW TO FISH. Then in GOOFY AND WILBUR, goofy and a spunky little grasshopper learn the true meaning of friendship on a hilariously bumbling fishing trip that somehow turns out right. And in BAGGAGE BUSTER, you'll laugh till your sides ache as Goofy tries to contain a magician's trunk that's bursting with bunnies, birds and a jungle-full of exotic animals. Also included are all-time comedy favorites LION DOWN and THE BIG WASH.
