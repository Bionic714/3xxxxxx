,AxU84,2010-02-23T20:00Z,My F-secure found virus in package. I didn`t even try to start the game.
,Icesteaam,2011-02-06T14:03Z,"I wish I could play this game, fortunately, the game won't even open?! I tried using on my Linux with Wine but it just said this: ""The file 'Blablabla has the directy of my game' is not marked as executable. If this was downloaded or copied from a untrusty or dangerous source this might be bad to run.""

I honestly don't get it and I wanna play sooooo bad!"
,Icesteaam,2011-02-06T14:04Z,I also tried it on my Windows 7 aswell! I'm gonna go mad!
,BogeyMaster,2011-04-26T11:31Z, THANKZ
,acenoise,2011-06-17T19:05Z,@ Icesteaam You need to right click the .exe go to properties/permissions and mark the box that says execute file! Its an in built safety feature of linux and one of the reasons you do not need virus protection so much on linux as all files downloaded are by default not executable untill you do the above! Hope that helps you m8
