,Mollekid,2006-10-16T21:50Z,"I must say I LOVE Christine Taylor she is the boom. But this movie made me want to rip my eyes out, eat them and post the pictures, cause this a SHITTY movie.
The acting sucks, the story makes no sense (what was that ending all about) and why does she run like that....?
Download only this movie if you want a laugh..."
