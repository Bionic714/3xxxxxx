I have to admit that though this game is a good RTS game it is not what I expected.  In Age of Empires and Age of Empires II I was used to playing historic battles for many nations.  In Age of Empires III, you fallow the story of a family over 3 generations.  Now though the storyline is good, I really expected the same time period but the ability to play as many nations in the colonization of America.  However, like I said this game is still a great game.  The graphics are improved a lot, but they are not too revolutionary.  The graphics in AOE II and I were revolutionary but these graphics are great but not revolutionary.  The sound effects were great, like AOE II and I; thankfully this had not changed.  The gameplay is very good, and is defiantly improved from AOE II; I am really amazed with all the improvements.  Even with a few disappointments this game still has a pretty good replay value.  I think that this is a great game but it really needed to stick with the storyline pattern of seeing the historical time periods from the eyes of other nations.  This is a great game and I recommend it to all RTS gamers, lets hope the expansion pack to this game will have storyline views from more then one nation.
