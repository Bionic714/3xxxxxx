,alfredjuh,2006-07-16T16:06Z,"I uploaded the DVD5 of S2D5 a while ago. You can find it here: http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3438898. I can reseed if needed.

,peteralf,2006-07-16T16:13Z,"Ahh, so that's where it was... It even shows up when I search for DS9, but because the name is longer, my brain just parsed it as being not a DVD release. Odd.

I just loaded it in uTorrent and a seeder seems to just have arrived. Everybody seems to be at 77% right now, so if anyone wants that disc, the torrent should be rather speedy right now. I had a down rate of 120KB/s after 30 seconds."
,gjesme473,2006-07-16T16:21Z,i see that this is star trek but i have no idea what this symbols ds9 or the s5d2.   Can someone explain what these symbols means?  
,peteralf,2006-07-16T16:28Z,"DS9 means Deep Space 9. 
Here's a link with overview of the episodes:
http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine
S5D2 means Season 5 Disc 2. There are four episodes on each disc, except the last discs in a season, so S5D2 contains episode 5-8 of season 5."
,bender-c,2006-07-16T16:35Z,"Im currently on the S2D5 too and i currently get about 150-200KBps so if it keeps on this speed i will have it complete in 6h or something, and i have alot of bandwidth over so just join up :-)

If someone have the .torrent fir for s2d3 i'll gladly help out with that last 0.5% people seems to miss. (i have the petsels release of the disc, not the one thats still here)"
,petsel,2006-07-16T17:46Z,"Its nice to see that you rguys are keepoing the seeds alive. I am sorry for not uplĂśoading the rest but I just cant get it to work...
I will try and reinstall my computer maybe that will solve it =((("
[V],firbie,2006-07-17T00:22Z,I have ds9 2disk 5 100% and seeding
,peteralf,2006-07-17T12:31Z,"Attention!
I have been trying to gather the DS9 torrents that were lost when TPB got raided. I now have done so. This torrent contains all the .torrent files for the DS9 DVDs that are currently not available on TPB:
http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3504261
I urge all to please help reseeding this."
,peteralf,2006-07-17T15:05Z,"@petsel
We're already more than grateful for the work you did getting the first 4Â˝ seasons up. I think that as long as bender-c is continuing your work, you needn't worry too much."
,Mr_Fear,2006-07-17T23:17Z,"For those interested, i've started seeding all of season 1 (petsel releases) and will continue seeding these for 14 days"
