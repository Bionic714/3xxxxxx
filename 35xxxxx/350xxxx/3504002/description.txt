This is petsel's version of Star Trek DS9 S5D2. It was lost when TPB servers were seized but here it is again.

I have seeded S4D6-S5D1 to the point where there is more than one copy so now would be a good time to download those. Search for DS9 to find them. I will seed this DVD to a couple of copies then move on to the next.

WANTED!
I am looking for the .torrents for all of the rest of petsels releases so I can reseed them without losing any of the people who have hung on to the "ghost torrent". This is a list of the .torrents I have that are not listed on TPB:
DS9_S2D2
DS9_S2D5 (DVD9 version)
DS9_S2D6
DS9_S2D7
DS9_S3D1
DS9_S4D4
DS9_S5D2
DS9_S5D3

As far as I can tell, that means I am missing the .torrents for these:
DS9_S2D1
DS9_S2D3

PM me if you have one of them.

I am currently stuck on 99.5% on DS9_S2D3. I deleted the torrent in uTorrent's directory, though :-(. If anyone would like to seed that to completion, there's like 14 people waiting for you.

Also, I don't have the DVD9 torrent for S2D5, since I CCE'd it to DVD5 when I had downloaded it. Again, all help is appreciated. I think someone uploaded a DVD5 version at some point.
