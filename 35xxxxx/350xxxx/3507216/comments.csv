,p2P2p,2006-07-26T05:02Z,I do and I am... this tor is all but a few hours old - have a little patience. Does your client support back-up trackers? Good things come to those who wait.
,extrudedplasticdingus,2006-07-26T05:31Z,"I didn't notice it wasn't uploaded to this tracker.  I don't think my client supports that, and it's still showing zero seeds after two hours.  Maybe I shouldn't have said anything but I've had a lot of bad torrents lately (people upload and don't seed or the file doesn't match description).  Still, nobody I'm connected to has more than 34 percent of the file."
