
Right, this is the 'ShopNotes Collection (Final)'

ShopNotes is a woodworking magazine. Rather good I think. They also have a web site (http://www.shopnotes.com/)
and sell woodworking plans online at their online plans store (http://www.plansnow.com/).

I had shared some of this before, but it was my first time and I wanted to improve it somewhat. Also some issues were of mediocre quality. 

This collection is WAY BETTER! All issues are of excellent quality bar 81, 82 & 83; but they are usable. There are a lot of extras with this collection - check out parts 11, 12, 13 & 14.

Don't forget, you can use uTorrent (or such) to selectively download parts of each torrent. Also, why not check out the files where you got the torrent?

Included with each is a file called 'ShopNotes Collection (Final) - File Listing.chm' and this file too.

Anyway, hope you like it. Ah, could someone please seed this after a while? Thanks. Moving hse in about 2 weeks, gonna lose bb connection.

PS. Apologies to previous downloaders, but I'm just getting the hang of sharing torrents. For you ppl, the main changes are parts 11 - 14 (added) and I was pretty clear about file quality before - just selectively download the updated files.

Cheers.
