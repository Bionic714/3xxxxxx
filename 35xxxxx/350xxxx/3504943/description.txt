Directed by award winning Australian filmmaker Carmel  Travers,
           Truth,  Lies  &  Intelligence  is  a  decisive  and  compelling
           exploration of the intelligence fraud that led the Collation of
           the Willing to war with Iraq.
 
           Taken from a previously undocumented Australian perspective and
           featuring exclusive interviews with ex-Australian  intelligence
           analyst Andrew  Wilkie, former  senior intelligence  advisor to
           Colin Powell:  U.S. Secretary  of State,  Greg Thielman, former
           Director  General  of  the CIA  James  Woolsey  and bestselling
           author Guzin Najim, an Iraqi refugee who spent six years  under
           house arrest during Saddam  Hussein?s regime before fleeing  to
           Australia.
 
           With 170,000 U.S.  troops now deployed  in Iraq supported  by a
           budget of US$200 billion, Truth Lies & Intelligence sheds light
           on a conspiracy  of nations and  reveals a land  and its people
           devastated by a conflict based on deception and fraud.
