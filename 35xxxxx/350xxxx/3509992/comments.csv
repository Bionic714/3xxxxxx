,blankbox,2006-08-07T03:34Z,"question....the ""readme file"".....is it a direct translation from the Russian.....or.....vice versa..???

curious minds wanna know ;)"
,scooby321999,2006-08-07T03:49Z,Thank you very much! Been waiting a long time to get a working copy of this! so btw.. are you saying that installing this will make Flight line N fuctional??
,WinnieXL,2006-08-07T03:50Z,Thank you so much. I was not able to `crack` this. 
,rrodger99,2006-08-07T04:05Z,"Well I just tried to install the FLN ver 5.3 & it didn't work....going against my own words but if there is a FLN 5.2 & someone could upload it...then it might work

As far as the readme...I am not sure...those are from the original Flt1 de-wrapper."
,scooby321999,2006-08-07T04:14Z,"Yea it turns out i already had the de-florater... but FlightLine T v5.2 works rather than v5.3 where you can extract and install it but you get the RXP logo on top of the gauge.. rendering the gauge useless...

Again, thanks very much!"
,WinnieXL,2006-08-07T04:41Z,"i had the same with the n-gauges. shit, they do not work yet. i would be great to crack that one to."
,scooby321999,2006-08-07T05:00Z,umm.. I just gave this a go and I am having the same problem as with v5.3!! I get the RXP logo covering the gauge and cannot remove them!!
,rrodger99,2006-08-07T06:15Z,I had the same issues with 5.3 but this 1 worked....make sure the RXPsvr.dll in the modules folder is not the 5.3 version
,scooby321999,2006-08-07T07:08Z,It's not.. it says it's ver 5.2.1!
,hirstey,2006-08-07T12:49Z,Thanks mate
,rrodger99,2006-08-07T16:02Z,"@ scooby

The only thing I can suggest is to eliminate all traces of any previous installs.Uninstall the T & N through the add/remove programs.

Go to the c182 /panel folder & get rid on any panel cfg files & go back to the default. Get rid of any modules. Delete the RXP file in fs9 & also the 1 on the c drive.

Run a registry cleaner."
,Rexxxifon,2006-08-07T21:48Z,"5.2 has been out for ages, anyone have a crack for 5.3? Thanks anyways rrodger."
