"Starsky & Hutch" roared onto small screens in 1975 to become one of the most popular and iconic series of the decade. This was TV's coolest buddy cop show, fuelled by full-throttle car chases, offbeat humour, colourful characters and a hip vibe. The hit series (1975-79) followed streetwise undercover detectives Dave Starsky (Paul Michael Glaser) and Ken 'Hutch' Hutchinson (David Soul) as they cruised around town in Starsky's red and white-striped Gran Torino, battling thugs and hoodlums with the help of their gruff boss, Captain Harold Dobey (Bernie Hamilton) and jive-talking informant Huggy Bear (Antonio Fargas).
