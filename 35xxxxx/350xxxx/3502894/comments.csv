,iamdanielcraig,2006-07-12T21:13Z,"Before anyone asks, i will not be uploading Season Two. This is because whilst Paul and David are alive they deserve, more than deserve, to receive the royalty from dvd sales. I myself have no money and bought these dvds over several years. This release is designed to encourage new viewers to watch the show and go on to buy the dvds themselves, not to make those dvds redundant.
much obliged"
[V],hozza,2006-07-12T21:39Z,NICE! Thanx !
,daqck,2006-07-13T13:37Z,Paul and David DO NOT recieve any royalty's as they sold them to Aaron Spelling. David now lives in the U.K. and is very pissed off he gets no royalty's from the show. So the only ppl you are stopping getting royalty's are not Paul and David but the producers of the show.
,iamdanielcraig,2006-07-14T08:45Z,"Due to the receipt of recent information from certain sources, iamdanielcraig will make no more statements at this time.

expect season 2 as full apology soon

all praise be to the Majesty that is paul michael of Glaser & Our Lord david of Soul"
