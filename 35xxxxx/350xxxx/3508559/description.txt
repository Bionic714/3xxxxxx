There are 120 levels, and on each level, the player must guide a group of up to 100 lemmings home by giving individual lemmings various commands. The \"lemmings\" of the game are small, green-haired humanoid beings that mindlessly walk en masse into any danger in their path. They are not the same as real-life lemmings, although they were named after the popular myth that real lemmings behave in a similar suicidal fashion.
