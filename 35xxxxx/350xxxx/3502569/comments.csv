I'm all for trying new things, it's just too bad that the previous posting wouldn't work for me.  I was begining to worry that I wouldn't get my Rollins fix this week.

Thanks a lot!"

Alternatively, you can install FFDSHOW, CoreAVS, or any number of other codecs and play the files in Media Player Classic, or Windows Media Player.

I've reseed this Divx Home Theater version of this file for the benefit of those who wish it.  I will also reevaluate the usage of x.264 for my future releases.  However I maintain that I ran extended tests and found that meathod does provide far superior quality compared to divx.


Cheers"
