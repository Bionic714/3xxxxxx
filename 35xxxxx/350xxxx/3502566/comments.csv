It would appear this RAR file was made from someone downloading from either a different torrent, or from USENET, and they didn't let the files finish downloading before they created this particular torrent."
,shellybadger182,2006-08-21T15:43Z,"seed plz, this album is cool"
,BodFred,2006-11-11T02:34Z,"Yup agree, with above comment, the last two track download as incomplete.

Anyone got a link to this album, full version, please.

Thanks,
BodFred"
