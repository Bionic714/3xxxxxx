This is DS9 S2D3, petsels release. I am currently trying to get all the DS9 torrents that were lost during the raid reseeded. bender-c offered to seed this one when it came up and has now done so (thank you). There should be quite a few seeds since we were all stuck on 99.5%. I know a lot of people are missing this DVD since I have been stuck on it since the end of May. Grab it now and seed generously. I won't be of much help since I am currently uploading S5D2.
Once I am done with S5D2 I will do S5D3 and then start from the beginning with petsels S1D1.
I anyone else feels like uploading some of the lost torrents I have uploaded them in a torrent available here:

If you reseed an old torrent, remember to leave a note in the comments section of one of the newer torrents also.
