[V],firbie,2006-07-17T13:37Z,It is a pity this is petsels release because in the first two seasons he cut of some subs including Dutch. But you are all doing a great job anyway.
,vekkis,2006-07-17T20:43Z,It would be great if someone would reseed S2D5 also because im missing it along with S2D3
,Mr_Fear,2006-07-17T23:16Z,"For those interested, i've started seeding all of season 1 (petsel releases) and will continue seeding these for 14 days"
,falcan,2008-01-11T16:18Z,"Could someone please seed/reseed this? Have been stuck at 99.9 for  a few months now. 

                                                          Thanx"
,levdr,2008-01-12T16:49Z,"I think I can help you. Maybe you can do me a favour and (re)seed S6D6 and S6D7 for us. A whole bunch of us are stuck at 96,7 and 99,9 %. We would be as grateful to you, as you are going to be to me in a moment :). Cheers."
,levdr,2008-01-12T19:03Z,"I'm afraid I spoke too soon. I forgot that the first 2 seasons I have in .avi. Truly sorry. If you want me to upload your missing episodes in .avi leave a message in the forum (look under requests, I've opened a topic there on DS9). Cheers."
,Nash-LR,2008-01-21T19:25Z,"Although stats say there are 0 leechers, in fact there are 12 people stuck here on 99,9% and no one to seed. Can/would somebody seed that 1/10 percent for us? Thanks!"
,V4Friend,2008-01-26T13:25Z,"Hi folks,

If you need re-seeding for any DS9-torrent(s), try posting in the forum too.

Try it, it's healthy :-)"
