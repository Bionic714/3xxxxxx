,dmtalan,2007-04-17T18:33Z,how to download Pinnacle PCTV MediaCenter Software V.3.4A?
,dmtalan,2007-04-17T18:42Z,"sorry, it is clear"
,NoWiSee,2007-05-06T16:29Z,"Sorry for not making it clear to everyone how to use this .ISO file. 

You have to have some CD burning software(Nero) and burn the .ISO to a CD(choose ""burn image to CD), or mount it with Deamon Tools(www.daemon-tools.cc). When you have mounted the image with Deamon Tools it should autorun the setup and install the software. You can also use the CD to install the drivers for the cards listed in the information on the top of this page. 

If there are any other questions please PM me about it. "
