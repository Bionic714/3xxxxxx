,knaak,2006-07-18T10:13Z,I'm going away for a while so I can leave my upload uncapped. This should mean more than 30 kb/s for a couple of days.
,knaak,2006-07-18T13:44Z,"for some reason the tracker reports 0 seeds but trust me, I am seeding. (currently at 80 kb/s, lightspeed for my connection, wohoo! :))"
,kanye,2006-07-18T20:58Z,please seed this for a few weeks im goin to vacations :)
,knaak,2006-07-24T09:30Z,I've uploaded about 33 GB now so I guess I've done my part on this. Now its up to you guys to keep it alive. If you need a reseed just say so here and I'll try to comply.
,t0rsk,2006-07-26T11:28Z,can u guys seed ffs im down to 1kb/s

,nitedrive,2006-07-30T20:35Z,"I´m seeding since last night,my upload speed isn´t great but at least I´m seedin´;)"
,knaak,2006-08-01T19:31Z,"theres no need to worry. when there are no more people seeding this I¨ll start seeding again just say something like ""reseed needed"" here. But I will only do it when there are absolutely no other seeders."
,nitedrive,2006-08-02T11:54Z,"Still me and two more ppl seeding,I´ll seed it as long as there are peers:)"
,Jay_kay123,2006-08-07T09:46Z,I am trying to seed this still but it crashes bit torrent every time I start it. Any ideas?
,knaak,2006-08-08T11:27Z,"Jay_kay123, what client do you use? try another one and see if that solves it (i recommend azureus if don't already use it)"
