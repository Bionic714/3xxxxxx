,martini-ice,2009-11-03T15:45Z,"@ jimbob_ownzu 

I know this is a late comment but 
1. unrar ( like unzipping a .zip file but then with a .rar file i would reccomend 7zip »»www.7-zip.org/«««)
2. burn or mount ( i guess you know what it is to burn a dvd... and you can mount a iso or a .nrg or whatever you would like + the program Daemon tools is in the discription »»» http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads ««« and then download daemon-tools lite.)


i guess that is everything you need to know ?

* and uuh im not a nerd or geek either so just STFU about them because I can do i too and if you would want the answer GO CHECK OUT SOME FORUM ABOUT PEEPS WHO DONT KNOW SHíT!! or you could just buy the f-ing game and just shut up ok "
