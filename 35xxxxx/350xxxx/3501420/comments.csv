,dustin1986,2006-10-15T11:18Z,"Someone actually owns a Gizmondo? After that company went belly up due to their ties to the swedish mafia, I didn't think any more of them existed. They're like the Delorean of the videogame world."
,Ran4,2006-11-11T11:40Z,"Gizmondos where sold really cheap in sweden after the company went down. But there's not so many gizmondos, that's correct. But who cares? Isn't such a super-cheap console worth some games? xD"
