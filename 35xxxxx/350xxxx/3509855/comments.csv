,Christian777,2006-08-12T20:57Z,"Hi seeder, thatnk for the up, but if you go out of superseeding mode others could help you seed and the dl would be much much faster ;)"
,Christian777,2006-08-12T20:58Z,@bakula : Jo dude dl what you need and let the rest be no problem doing that with azaurus ;)

,Lethean,2006-11-26T21:23Z,Thanx for a great seed
,helpme_115,2006-12-05T20:08Z,"This is not english, is it something im doing as no1 else has complained!"
,cyber857,2007-01-20T22:52Z,"Dear filesharers, it appears that folks no longer have good manners and seed to a ratio of 1 when there done downloading (if they did there would still be seeds for every torrent) as this is just a reality I will be re-seeding everything I have uploaded these Re-seeds will take place on Monday and Tuesday of each week and I will join the Swarm in Inital-seed (super-seed) mode, That is i will show up as a peer and not a seed. My program will stop uploading if the avablity is greater than 1 for the partial swarm i have connected to or if there is any other full seeds (this allows me to keep all the torrents alive in the most effecent manner). Please keep these torrents running on Monday and Tuesday to help spread the data. And as always the best thing you can do to help is to seed, if you would like to join me Mondays and Tuesdays please feel welcome to share (perferably in seed mode)."
,Vtx 1800,2007-02-03T00:20Z,Ladda inte ner trubleshooter i filen upptäckt virus där annars en bra serie
,laconfused,2007-02-04T14:50Z,"You might want to try seeding the last 2 seasons separately, as the first 3 seasons were released on DVD at least in the US and Canada.  That would make it easier for those that can't download individual pieces."
,asmariamoon,2007-05-20T19:21Z,"Thanks a lot for this, great series, and all the files I've watched work perfect, and it's downloading at an impressive rate of about a full file per day now, so awesome upload, keep on seeding, please."
,brullo,2007-08-19T19:06Z,"trevligt att det var dubbat till nått oförståligt språk ,,,."
,angelustatoo,2007-09-26T20:08Z,I back up the people on here talking about Dubbing. I have been downlooading this for days and put priority on Ep.1 &2.. Only to find out that there IS !!!!!!!!! Someking of Dubbing over the top of the original ENGLISH Soundtrack. Can ANYONE confirm if the whole lot is the same cos if it is.. Its useless to EVERONE bar the dubbed Language...And I dont want to waste anymore time... EVERYONE check!!!!! If it is DDubbed on all then you should tell people cyber857!!!!!!!!!!
,shaggyy,2007-10-26T20:56Z,plsssss seed me :((
,MYTROC,2007-12-10T00:53Z,"There's a second language (Russian?) dubbed over the top of the original English, which caused a slight echo in the english as well.  It's viewable, but watching two episodes in a row gave me a bad headache.  "
,tavisjohn,2007-12-29T08:06Z,"Episode 08 is fine.
It is episode 18 that is the crappy one."
,MYTROC,2008-01-04T03:54Z,"I couldn't stand the echo effect anymore, so I got a better player than windows media player and found you can turn off the russian transloator guy.  I recommend Media Player Classic for this, it came with the k-lite codec pack "
,tabloiid,2008-01-07T19:29Z,"First of all THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR UPLOADING THIS and THANKS A MILLION TO THE SEEDERS!

Here is one show that should come back!

As far as the idiots on here... argh!  They include VLC player for you.  It automatically plays the 2nd audio track.  I never heard the dubbing until I checked the audio tracks with VLCs awesome fatures ;)"
,knightofmists,2008-02-08T22:51Z,well worth the 2 day download.. quality is questionable.. but overall its a must have for slider fans!! Thanks
,unick,2008-02-16T13:41Z,all epp are in russian???can u seed more please:)
,softdick69,2008-02-17T09:52Z,"i""ve downloaded season 1 and i cannot play episode 8 ( the weaker sex), why is it? anybody?
do i need a new codec? other episode are fine, playing even at window media player,."
,foomonger,2008-02-19T04:59Z,"cyber857, thanks for the upload - proper names with spaces, no silly rar files or extraneous samples, and bonus material thrown in, too. Nice work. 

unick, no, they are not in Russian, though there is a second audio track, which is Russian. Most media players will play the first (English) only, and allow you to choose the second if you wish (i.e. Media Player Classic, BS Player, VLC, etc.)

softdick69, there's no apparent difference between 1x08 and other episodes. Perhaps you have some corruption in the file header/index. Stopping the torrent and running a re-check (hash check) might be the answer. Any corrupted pieces will be flagged for re-download. 

-fm"
,softdick69,2008-02-20T09:05Z,"foomonger, yup! your right, i've got a corrupted file,, i redownload it again, and it works fine, thank pal..

thanks cyber857"
,ddelta,2008-03-03T09:45Z,I keep getting file error
,JackTorrents,2008-03-14T19:39Z,I have seasons 1-3 on DVD and the quality is bad so keep that in mind when watching these.
,golephish,2008-04-15T21:35Z,seed please
,Khonshu69,2008-04-18T06:06Z,Couple of trojans in the troubleshoot rar
,BUBBBAS,2008-06-10T22:47Z,aaaah..nice. thanx
,cyberax2650,2008-07-02T11:27Z,"I think this 2 years old upload still has intererest for many people, but only one person is actively seeding it at the very slow speed of 3 kb/s, and it is a 30 Gb file!
Could more people please seed it actively ON LINE?I will do it also afterwards."
,nippie221,2008-08-03T07:53Z,"i agree it takes for ever, to download, i will seed for one more week then after that if it doesn't pick up? i will drop it,"
,nippie221,2008-08-03T12:30Z,"I have a strong feeling that the limit is put on every half an hour, this is the long download i have EVER come across, i have downloaded twice the size files with 95% faster, if you have the time to wait then feel free to download but i have been on 96% for a week and a half, thats not normal!"
,cyberax2650,2008-08-06T00:19Z,"I got it all (it took 23 days), and as promised I seed it, but  even though there are over 600 leechers, they download it from me only at about 10 kb/s when other torrents upload at much higher speed (400 kb/s). I do not understand this low upload speed. when I could upload it easely at 9000 kb/s. Something is strange about the download and upload speeds of this torrent."
,nippie221,2008-08-08T22:52Z,"Yep i know, the program is amazing but it takes way too long, the uploads are higher than the downloads"
,Breezeycouk,2008-09-26T23:49Z,"I think there maybe a trojan in the torrent?

Don't download the troubleshoot file"
,FEAR.ME,2009-01-06T19:55Z,Great torrent Will continue seeding as long as possible. 
,voodooi,2009-02-22T01:10Z,C'mon SEED! This is a great series. Unfortunately since I'm Canadian HULA is blocking me from its streams = / GG ...forced to download it.
,voodooi,2009-03-01T02:02Z,Ugh...its in a different language...Russian? what's up with that?
,voodooi,2009-03-01T02:34Z,"Ugh, this torrent is full of problems. Each time i attempt to open the Sliders folder it freezes my computer forcing reboots "
,harveymasters,2009-04-04T04:56Z,Great Torrent.  I had to download another media player so I would not be forced to listen in Russian and English (Windows Media Player has so few options).  I went with VLC and I haven't had any problems with the show since.  I've seeded three times my download and I will continue to seed for as long as I can.  I'd encourage anyone who complains that the torrents you download are too slow to start seeding at least 100%.  Pay it forward and we can all be some happy fucking pirates.  Viva la Pirate Bay!!!
,DarkDanjal,2009-04-13T00:01Z,OMG!.... grwat upload... but limewire tell's me the download will take 145 dayssSss????... r u kiding me?.. please seeeedddddd.....

,camicio,2009-11-29T00:46Z,Does anyone have the english subtitles for episodes 06 to 12 of season 2 please? I can only find them for the first 5 episodes. Thanks.
,cyber857,2010-06-21T14:47Z,"you should not need english sub titles because there is 2 tracks of audio, the english and the russian. IF you hear both tracks at once use a different player or check out other options on your current player."
,lawman561,2010-07-28T08:57Z,"Cyber thanks for providing a great UL. I really enjoy this series and the cast. This UL scanned clean with AVAST, and some people do get false positives with some scanners. Anyway thanks again, A-9+, V-10. Very good quality."
,dannyboiii19,2011-06-17T13:32Z,"Why the hell is it dubbed in russian, god why cant people just make a simple english torrent with none of that dubbed and different language subtitle shit."
,mc00598,2012-01-19T05:39Z,"@dannyboiii19  you DO realize that there are over 6.5 billion other people in the world, RIGHT? and that english is NOT the first language of most of those people? And that most of the ""pirates"" are not domiciled in USA or G.B.? It's probably dubbed in Russian because it was likely made from a disc set to which Russian was the primary language, adn the original English was an alternate audio. sheesh, can you really complain? you ARE a pirate, something for nothing, right? looks like a great torrent cyber! getting 10 seeders and over 30 peers at the start, which is more than I can say for the other all 5 seasons upload, since it returns an error from TPB, and OBT doesn't seem to be hittin on anything, even though it shows 30 seeders on the indexed wp"
