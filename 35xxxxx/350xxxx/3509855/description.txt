Sliders Season 1 - 5 + some extras.
Utilities include ac3, vlc, etc

all files are standard sizes 326-356 except for 2 as i could not find those so if you have 5x02 and/or 5x08 please upload and link there torrents to this one with a comment (i have provided lower quality rips of those two episodes. please enjoy and as always before you comment about no seeders realize that people use super-seeding (initial seeding) which only shows them as a peer not a seed. just start it and wait ^^.

* EDIT @ sept, 4 2008, Hey I'm back in the states and can help seed this. Looking at comments some people say there are Trojans in the troubleshoot package I provided. I rescanned it and still show nothing but you don't even need to open the file. It was provided for those who needed vlc or the ac3 codec etc. You can of course get these from other sources.

If you have the audio problem (Can hear dialog in English, and Russian) download VLC (if you don't wanna open the troubleshoot) and it should play anything there.

As to quality I provided the best I could get my hands on.
