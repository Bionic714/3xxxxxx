,koffzzon,2006-08-05T13:21Z,"Anybody have a version of Creative Suite that works well with Intel Macs (Macbook)? I've heard rumours that this version will get my new mac fubar if I try to install it... So, anybody know if this version works with intel macs or not?"
,sailorboy1601,2006-08-24T17:03Z,"As far as I know, CS2 works with the new intel mac. However, it is reputedly much slower than CS because it doesn't support intel dual-processors."

,beren12,2006-10-15T09:05Z,"*how to finish the torrent*

download this: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3509114

start, then stop the torrent. Move the downloaded .dmg files from this torrent's download to the new one, and replace the .dmg files (they are 99% the same). Then the torrents will finish and everyone will be happy. :) After we get some good seeders (my upload sucks) this torrent can be closed."
,beren12,2006-10-15T09:06Z,"Gah! whoops, wrong link. The Correct torrent is http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3539597"

,XweAponX,2007-07-14T20:25Z,"Hey SadKaff:

I appreciate that you wanna help and that you want to post these Torrents and try to help some of us really poor people who can't afford 1,000 dollars for software bundles likethis...

But It seems like every one of your torrents has something that makes it less than effective?

If it is just 1 or 2 torrents, I give the guy the benefit of the doubt. But ALL of your torrents have failed for one reason or another...

Then I have to think if there is some shenanigan-ry at hand. Look: ALL you gotta do is load the torrent into uTorrent and SEED that damn thing... It is not that hard, the program takes care of it.

As a matter of fact it is SO easy to send up a torrent and seed it properly that we are starting to think you are deliberately flublitzing this up?

Is Adobe paying you off in free photoshop for doing this shite?

Just what IS the going rate for SHILLS lately?"
,rhcordeiro,2007-12-07T19:44Z,"come on guys! Share! 99,4%? 

Share please!"

,COJO24,2008-02-07T00:08Z,why will it not download the last .66%???? Someone seed or something ive been on 99.44% for 3 days
,10mil,2008-03-08T09:10Z,"If you are stuck at 99.4% do a search for:
Adobe.Creative.Suite.2.Premium.MAC.OSX-RoME

Download the torrent uploaded on March 8 2008.

Then follow the instructions to complete your download or do a fresh download."
,rotting_brain,2008-06-01T23:42Z,we need seeders!!!!!
,Georami,2008-06-27T02:45Z,FUCK YESSS. My friend lent me his creative suite 2 premium. Ive been hunting for a working serial all day and the first one you gave worked. Dunno anything bout this download though. Thanks for the serial!!
