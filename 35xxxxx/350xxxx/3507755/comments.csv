Raspon.. Why dont you just wright down the subs presented on this release? Is it that hard? ""a lot of ther subs""?? helpfull... lol!
well, anyway, mpoit957: since it has swedish subtitles it`s 99.9% sure it is a PAL.(concidering that PAL is european standards)  
Kurko: Since our good friend, Raspo here failed to give you an answer to one of your breathtaking two!! questions (lol), I can say that you will get your finnish subs on this release, I have not yet seen an ""original"" release with eng, swe and span subs, that not also contains finnish and norwegian.. 

That beeing said, I`m glad that Raspo joins in on the uploader ""side"", but if you don`t want your comments to look like some freakin` crucifixion, then you should really consider wrighting more info!  =)  


Cheers!
