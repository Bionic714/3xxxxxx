,rawrex,2006-07-20T02:47Z,"there will always be those ass wipes who expect perfection for free...well its free and yes its the whole..i saw it in theaters i know how long it is, this is it without the credits..i never said perfect but it is very watchable..some parts are really dark..but trust me they were just as dark in the theaters...so if you want dvd perfection wait for the dvd rip ,but if you can handle 8 / 10 then DL. it and if you know a better copy floating around..let me know i'll get it ..myself.."
