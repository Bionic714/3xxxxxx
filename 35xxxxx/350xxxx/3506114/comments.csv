,scooby321999,2006-07-23T12:45Z,DarkPilot : I used to have the problem as well.. recently I had to re-format my hard-drive and when I tried to install the Piaggio 180 and the C337 it worked!! So it could be that if ANY of FSD products fail to install it records it in the registry and prevents others from installing!! The only way is to reformat... there could be another way...but this worked for me!
,DarkPilot,2006-07-23T20:33Z,"Thanks Scooby, I imagined a similar problem for registry, If one even knew the key it would cancel it.
Sooner or later reformat my pc, for hour do not get lost a lot is not that the airplane fsd are all this beauty.
Only 337 is very good..
The other production fsd not ago to scream to the miracle!
:))))"
,StealthFighter80,2006-07-24T00:07Z,"@gusty,Thanks!"
,Massmordaren,2006-07-24T11:48Z,Too... wonderful... for... words...
,colimodio,2006-07-24T12:50Z,"Dont use this package!! It will damage all you FSD planes. In may case the Aerostar started a problem after i had them all OK. The keygen leaves a mark in your registry which causes the Load Manager (which has the Licence number) to crash and from there you will have all kinds of problems. The way to do FSD planes is installing them with another computer to run the keygen. IT cannot be run in the same computer you're installng the airplane from FSD. Thanks a lot FSD!!! Gosh I HATE FSD !!! They are real assholes!!!!
"
,Panodilo,2006-07-24T18:46Z,FSD are going down the drain anyway. They've been disowned by both Flightsim.com and Avsim. They might as well apply for barbers' college.
