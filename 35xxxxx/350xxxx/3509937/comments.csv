,vild,2006-08-06T23:05Z,thx manndrine good work ;) 
,manndrine,2006-08-06T23:54Z,There is an issue with the audio towards the end of the movie...  but ts free so dont complain.
,manndrine,2006-08-08T15:46Z,"When I currently compress the DVD I am using the lowest setting. I can increase the zipage, but it will take longer for you to unzip... please let me know what you would prefer; as I have DVD release just about ready for upload.

So either:
 a) smaller download - longer unzip
 b) larger download - quicker unzip"
,manndrine,2006-08-10T20:48Z,"for basic BT questions:

,manndrine,2006-08-15T04:19Z,"MAKE SURE YOU CHECK SCREENSHOTS BEFORE DOWNLOADING ANY OF MY TORRENTS. IN CASE YOU MISSED THE LINK IN THE ""IFO"" SECTION - http://www.esnips.com/web/manndrine-mysuperex"

,elyk1212,2006-12-24T19:41Z,"""Do not DOWNLOAD! REALLY BAD QUALITY""

Sorry, I have to agree. You may want to not compress so much.  The resolution was crazy grainy on my TV DVD player and every one I tried it on (even my computer).  I suggest not retouching the Video quality when possible.  

It's too bad, this is the only NTSC release :(  The pal one is kicking in full resolution: ""My.Super.Ex.Girlfriend.2006.CUSTOM.FIN.SWE.SUB.PAL.DVDR-SFB"""
