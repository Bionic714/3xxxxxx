Total Annihilation with A LOT OF STUFF xD.

3.1 patch

CC+BT maps / units

TAUCP Pack (Total Annihilation Unit Compilation Pack, comes with hundreds of units, and select \"elite\" AI\'s, cheating and non cheating. To customize options or disable, load the frontend.exe file found in the main TA folder.)

No CD

[b]Soundtrack included (Actually I forgot to include it, get it here - http://zwzsg.hosted.luckz.de/stuff/TotalA%20soundtrack )

Save all 17 tracks onto your PC, then burn them onto a CD. Initiate a game, then insert the CD into the CD-Rom drive, and the game will automatically register the CD and begin playing.

Btw, you can insert any audio cd during gameplay and it\'ll play from within the game. =o. Just thought that was worth mentioning. It\'ll automatically change tracks, either sequentially or randomly, but if you want to tamper with it, press Tab - Options - Music. Just thought that was worth mentioning.[/b]

[b]As this is a self functioning rip, without the need to setup, you will need to take the following actions to prepare for multiplayer play.

Download the GBLTA Register File, which will...register TA xP. Once TA is registered, you should be able to play on PhoenixWorx or the MSN Gaming Zone.

There are also several other issues however, that occur to everyone with TA, which can be resolved through a few router reconfigurations and other minor changes.

If you have any problems, ask any of the pros at PhoenixWorx or the Zone, and they\'ll probably help you...unless they\'re in TAG or something xD.[/b]

Unit / Map / Misc Crap Viewing/Creation files included

Multiplayer crap included

And a hell lot more =S. This is a GREAT game, RTS, Real Time Strategy.

Oh yeah, Disks One AND Two are included, thus you can do all 25 missions on both Arm and Core sides (50 total, if you were wondering), to get settled in =).

I even ripped out all 50 mission Glamour shots and camp briefs (Glam shots are those leet images you see after you successfully complete a mission)
