,LaggingOutAcc,2006-07-05T17:26Z,"hoi! you wite to much. So i just ask, is it able to go multiplayer?"
,acidd_uk,2006-07-05T17:31Z,"If you like TA, then check out TA Spring - an open source, fully 3d amazing remake of this great game! Join the thriving Spring community!

They are very helpful. I don't like the dwarfs though, all they do is get drunk and bump into things. The puzzles are very difficult. Hmm. maybe not best adventure game ever, Need for Speed is better adventure game."
,Trent Hawkins,2006-11-26T10:39Z,How can i extract this 7z file???
,b0dyrem0ver,2007-09-28T02:49Z,"TA's been a regular feature on my computer since I got it 9 years ago. Still playing it to this day, especially multiplayer. Only thing that gets on my nerves is that I can never get my copy to run after a Windows reinstall unless I do the full installation first, still... One of the best games ever made. That and TA Spring, of course. :D"
,mr.picks,2009-05-23T10:52Z,"Well when I click on setup.exe it says ""Uable to initialize setup files"" and when I click on totala.exe, totala original CD required.exe or TotalA_NOCD_3.1c.exe the screen goes black and i can't do anything, ctrl+alt+delete doesnt work, or alt+tab and I have to hard reboot.

And seeing as there's no readme to explain how to use this torrent to play total annihilation, I have no idea what to do.

Any hints?"
,mr.picks,2009-05-23T11:01Z,"Further to that, setup.ini seems to point to ""totala3.hpi"" which isn't in the torrent at all"
