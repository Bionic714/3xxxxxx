,mrnix,2007-09-06T23:33Z,"Thanks! I really enjoyed him playing that night. Got to hang out in the DJ booth (as I did as babylon) with him and shoot the breeze. 

The entire club loved his set; they went wild. The funny thing is that he only had like 10 records with him: each one was pressed by him and already had several mixed tracks :) I joked with him about cheating and he said ""and do you ALWAYS do it the hard way?"".
