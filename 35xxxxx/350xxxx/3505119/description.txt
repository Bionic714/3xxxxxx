A concept based upon Common's 2005 Album "BE", produced by Kanye West. 



BE3 takes Kanye's production on a journey through life on London's streets, through the eyes of DOC4 the verbal physician. From tracks like "London City", giving you a real perspective of life in the capital, to the likes of "My Sista", a soulful blend of righteous teachings and skillfull storytelling. 



This Mixtape has the combination of raw lyrics and concious delivery, driven by the "real" of Hip Hop.
