,earwaxandtoast,2006-07-29T19:04Z,"I haven't played the game yet, but if you create a shortcut and go to properties you could assuredly put it into win95 compatibilty mode and it should work. good luck"
,El Jafar,2006-07-29T23:23Z,"I haven't played the game yet either, but I have a similar problem with ""Magic the gathering"". That one doesn't even install if the OS is not win95 or 98. Fooling it with ""run in win95 compability mode"" does not do the trick."
,UGEZ,2006-07-30T10:53Z,"I managed to get this to run on winxp, dont remember how i did it thoug. most likely i have the file on the pc somewhere ^^"
,tspse,2006-07-30T23:58Z,"i could install it, but when i launch it, it hangs at start (""not responding"")
i tried anything, never worked."
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2006-07-31T17:14Z,It installed and runs fine on my system.  I'm using Win98SE for it.
,slipstream_73,2006-08-27T10:22Z,"I feel like an idiot for asking this, I have downloaded this file, could someone email how to make it to a workable file, please."
,slipstream_73,2006-08-28T21:21Z,"ok i got the files workable, does anybody remember the cd name (the name that shows up on the my computer screen by the drive) to put on it so it will reconize which cd it is."
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2006-08-31T11:20Z,The label (name) of the CD is the same as the name of the files here: 'Armada'.
,mdvbilt,2007-04-07T20:13Z,Would someone please be kind enough to email me and tell me how to make these files workable?  Thank you.
,FrogFae,2007-04-17T20:42Z,Seems to work fine under Win XP Pro.  Even before I looked into compatibility options.  Though I've recently added 'Disable advanced text services' since they wouldn't be supported anyhow
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-12-10T06:57Z,"Um, excuse me, but how did you do that?  ???  (I'm using WinXP Home now.)"
,Jonfendm,2008-01-08T00:35Z,"Im not sure what your alls problem with this is. I have played this g ame loyally since its release, and never had a problem with using it on Windows XP. The only issue is in multiplayer, you can only play it with people on the same OS as you, but 99% of the community is XP, so it doesnt matter anymore."
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2008-02-23T05:30Z,"Hmm, I'm not sure either.  I've always had major glitches with the 3D video, and the background music skips.

Pleeeease, someone walk me through getting this to work 100% on WinXP!  :/"
,red-thunder555572,2008-03-19T01:50Z,"thx so much this a realy great game, if u want birht of the federation (BOTF)  i have a working copy that works on xp!!! just request it from my email yuri-s-w@hotmail.co.uk cause i dont know if anyone wants it."
,red-thunder555572,2008-03-19T02:00Z,"i have an idea that might help u, go to start then programs and find it the exe main program right click the exe in programs and compatibility settings try them all."
,Bhaal13,2008-05-19T19:31Z,"I have xp and the background music and individual ships and structures voices are screwed up while the 3d scenes work perfectly.  other than that the game performs beautifully, if anyone could help me to fix these issues, that would be great.  love this game"
,Grim_Reaper1202,2008-06-23T20:02Z,seed please
,DonkeyBallz,2008-11-18T07:26Z,"I installed the game, and when I try to being a mission it says ""please insert the cd"" How do I make it think the cd is in the drive? "
,bodysurfnj,2009-01-08T21:50Z,can someone tell me how to trick the game into thinking that the game is in the disk drive? 
,ja_lovato,2009-03-10T22:13Z,"Ok, I need help.
What do i do after i download the torrent?
What do i do with the .BIN & .CUE files?
Please help me."
,nvrbad,2009-05-05T20:50Z,"Works fine with Xp. This used to be my favorite game, thanks for the upload!"
,GLR457mAn,2009-11-12T19:56Z,"this game works just fine on wondows 7. works fine on any os really if you know what your doing. aka right clicking on the games .exe & setting compatibilty dis able desktop comp/advanced text services'  & for vista/win7 os.
 you can also try opening task manager & then ending explorer after you alt/tab out of the game to help with the gfx issues. also this game doesnt like linked gfx cards. aka ati cross fire/ nividas w/e thay have. hope this helps."
,GLR457mAn,2009-11-12T19:58Z,"you can play this game online @ gameranger. just google gameranger 

gameranger is a nice free to play cracked/legit games at. thay support over 600+ game's new & old. dont pass this place up you just
might have a old game that you thought was dead & is still living live & well @ gameranger.

the ports for gameranger use's 16000-16000 tcp-udp

also be a good idea to open the ports for all your online games as well. come on trekies!!"
,SiliconAddict,2009-12-02T03:59Z,I own the game.  It installs and runs flawlessly in windows 7 without needing any compat mode tweaking.  If you are having any issues look to the source content as a root cause.. *shrugs*
,leumasmi,2010-01-09T03:25Z,"i installed the game and it works fine up to the point where you click on the federation campaign, then a message pops up telling me to insert the armada cd.

help anyone?? ^^"
,FreeHansje,2010-03-21T18:28Z,"It does not work fine at all with WXP, and I doubt it works with W7. Ppl telling otherwise should backup their words with how they have done that. I tried all Compatibility options, nodice.
Pity."
,FreeHansje,2010-03-21T18:55Z,"UPDATE:
It seems Star Trek Armada does not like DX9 and most modern graphic cards. Obviously I am not going to downgrade my system just to play 1 game.
Pity."
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2010-07-16T23:27Z,"Okay, people--I\'ve figured out how to get it to work on WinXP!  (I\'m now using WinXP Pro w/ DirectX 9.0c.)  You must do two things, both simple and easy to do:rnrn1)  Open your DirectX Diagnostic Tool program.  To do this, you can go into your Start Menu and select Run....  In the box that opens, type \'dxdiag\' (without the single-quote marks, obviously).  In short:rnrnStart Menu > Run... > dxdiagrnrnNow with the DirectX Diagnostic Tool running, you\'ll notice a series of tabs at the top.  Go to the one that says something like \""Sound\"" or \""Sound 1\"" and click it.  There will then be a slider that claims to control Hardware Acceleration of your computer\'s audio.  Set it to Basic Acceleration.  Now you can close the DirectX Diagnostic Tool--you\'re done with it.rnrnThat will solve the problem of any and all skippings of audio in the game.rnrn2)  Boot the game.  In the Video Options, set the resolution and color depth to something other than the lowest setting (which is the default).  It think it might be like 640x800x16.  If you have a good enough video card like I do, go on ahead and set it to its maximum: 1600x1200x32.  But whatever you do, just make sure that it\'s not set to its lowest, default setting.rnrnThis willl solve the problem of glitches in the video.rnrnDo these two simple little things and you can play the game 100% on WinXP!  WOOOO!  :DrnrnNow you try it yourself!  :)"
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2010-07-16T23:32Z,"Jesus!  What happened to my formatting in my Comment up there!?  And what\'s with all those slashes!?  ???rnrnWelp, hope you can still read that anyway--dunno what happened, just typed it regular-like, it\'s not my fault.  :-/"
,Darylmc1987,2010-09-05T16:23Z,"My WindowsME system used to play this game perfectly. now i install it and when i try to run it, ny computer wont play the opening video, it just goes to black screen.

nothing has changed on my computer, but it suddenly wont play anymore. why??"
,Darylmc1987,2010-09-05T16:27Z,can this game be forced to run in a window? and can the opening video be forced to run in a window or disabled completely?
,Darylmc1987,2010-09-05T16:32Z,TROJAN! My antivirus just repeated 5 times that this contains a Trojan...
,ktegate,2011-01-09T14:22Z,"There is still a small community who play this online an have to a degree some tech support and fixes for armada working with windows 7  or xp.
You can find them at http://starmada.freeforums.org/

its small, but very helpiful"

Unofficial patch to make Armada work with newer computers. Worked for me."
,marsuvees22,2012-07-30T20:30Z,To those of you having issues getting the game to play do to the lack of crack which i did thanks alot uploader... -_- anyways i found a crack for v1.2 at game copy world all you need to do is upgrade to the new patch at the uploader's link  and then copy the cracked files to the game installation if you have any issues try running in compatibility mode
