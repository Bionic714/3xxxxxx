This is a CD image (in .BIN & .CUE) of Star Trek: Armada, a great RTS game.  Created from an original CD-ROM.  Needs update patch (v1.2) which can be d/led from here:

(among other places on the web).
WARNING: This game (AFAIK) will NOT work properly with WinXP.  Requires Win95, Win98, or Win98SE (or some proper emulation of said OSs) to play.  (OTOH, if you know how to get this to run properly on, say, WinXP Pro, then please do let me know.  :)  )
