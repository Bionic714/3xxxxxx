,Triel,2006-07-25T10:20Z,"Well, I tried it again and this is what it states,
""This Update is only compatible with the English (United States) version of F.E.A.R. Please use the correct Update for the installed version of the game.""

,sirvondutch,2006-11-03T20:17Z,"Tnx for seeding people!

What I did to make the game work perfectly (i've had the errors to):

First download this update (not the one the game wants to download, just abort that one):
http://www.sierra.com/en/home/games/game_info.tab-downloadtab.prod-L2NvbnRlbnQvc2llcnJhL2VuL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2ZfZV9hX3JfX3JlZ3VsYXJfZWRpdGlvbg%3d%3d.platform-pc.html

Then download this crack and put it in the original FEAR folder as replacement of FEAR.exe:
http://www.gameburnworld.com/dl/dl.php?file=F.E.A.R.v1.08NoDVDFixedexeEng.rar

The game is wicked, I hope my help will be usefull so we can all shiver!"

,azidtrip,2007-03-30T22:08Z,BTw. U should expect it to be slow when u see like 5 seeders and 30 people downloading. So STFU and contribute instead of bitching.
