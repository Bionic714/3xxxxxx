The combination of hard rock music And camp theatrics from singer Freddie Mercury 
proved to be a goldmine for Queen. Millions of record sales and sold out concerts 
all over the globe meant that their inimitable brand of rock 'n' roll would never 
be forgotten. An amazing live band, 
the group were also masters of the video genre, providing campy, cheeky promo's 
that showed off the flamboyant theatrics of singer Mercury. This second collection 
of their videos includes such classic songs as "A Kind of Magic," "Radio Ga Ga," "I 
Want To Break Free," and more.

Have fun
