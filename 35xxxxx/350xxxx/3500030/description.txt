Straight up, this is a very fine recital. Almost twenty years old to the day, World of Rhythm records the fabulously telepathic piano trio of Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, and Billy Cobham. Comparing this recording with two recently released Keith Jarrett videos (Standards and Standards II), World of Rhythm wins hands down. 
The decade of the '80s is not a time I would associate with the traditional jazz piano trio. But here that trio is as practiced by three potently strong musical personalities. Herbie Hancock eschews his electronic trappings for this simple presentation of several of his best-known compositions. "Speak Like a Child", "Little Waltz", "Dolphin Dance" and "Eye of the Hurricane" all reveal their inner charm in this intimate setting.
