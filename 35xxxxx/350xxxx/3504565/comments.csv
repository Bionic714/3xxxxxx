,MeanGreenMother,2006-12-04T04:29Z,"SoundWall and Colobot... i found the movie to be humorous, exciting, and touching; you cretinous, pedantic, ignorant bits of human debris. do the human race a favor and remove yourselves from the gene pool.

idiots."

,roborabbit,2007-02-22T21:47Z,please seed more
,mungo75,2007-03-10T16:30Z,"Unless I am mistaken the movie is actually the finale of the Firefly series. So really you needed to watch he series first. 

I assume it happened this way because the series was cancelled.

I generally liked the series, but the western theme went overboard, especially with the music.

Cheers to the uploader."

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
,ugaboj,2007-05-30T14:31Z,Hobbitinn and SoundWall YOU suck your balls elsewere. But we enjoy this shiney film.
,RPGesus,2007-07-14T02:45Z,"Thanks for the wave, its shiney!"
,mark_5600,2007-08-06T22:29Z,"no sound? tried VLC, WMP, everything"
,sp0tty,2008-01-05T01:07Z,"yes SoundWall, because your upload http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3614048/Sawnie_International_(Sony_Parody)
is clearly amazing.

on another note, the gritty rough-and-tumble setting of Firefly is a breath of fresh air in today's glamourized Star Wars-knockoff-flooded sci-fi scene. But you really have to watch the whole television series to get the most out of this movie."
,burton02,2008-03-12T06:51Z,"Great Movie...!  even if you have not seen the series.  However, if you do watch the series first it makes it that much better.  I hope they make Serenity 2 someday..!"
,Gsusasole,2009-12-11T16:23Z,"u assholes 
me praise the movie"
