This season was marked by the death of Gene Roddenberry in October during the shooting of Hero Worship. This season above all others was the most emotional and certainly my personal favorite. 
Of this season, Disaster and The Inner Light hold personal significance for me and my life at the time of their original airing. ***Special note: also included is the Tribute to Roddenberry from dvd.
Enjoy and seed.
