CNDV-60MP (Western US Disc)
Pioneer Electronics 2006 Upgrade Discs for the Pioneer Navigation Systems


Navigation System Upgrade for all-in-one Navigation Systems
* Model Year 2006 TeleAtlas Database
* Compatible with AVIC-N2, AVIC-D1, AVIC-N1
* 11 Million Points of Interest
* Includes database and feature upgrades equivalent to the AVIC-N3 and AVIC-D2.
*** Compatible with AVIC-N1, AVIC-N2 and AVIC-D1 only.

Includes instruction file, written by someone else. I have successfully performed the upgrade on an AVIC-N2 using this disc. The disc includes both the software upgrade, and the new TeleAtlas data. The original image (6.6Gb) was obtained using Alcohol 120% (Media Descriptor File, MDF). It was compressed using WinRAR.
You will need to decompress the MDF file to the original 6.6Gb image, then burn it to a double layer (DVD-DL) disc. This will only fit on a double layer disc. Then follow the instruction file to perform the software upgrade. Use the disc as your navigation data disc once you have upgraded the software.
The original retails for about $250 from Pioneer (see top of description). Ripped copies are on eBay for about $30-50. If there is sufficient interest, I will prepare and upload the Eastern US Disc.
