,DiamondGCoupe,2006-11-21T20:27Z,Does anyone have CNDV-40R East for US.
,gotbud,2006-12-04T03:46Z,"hey, i repacked the files so there is no more errors on mounting or extracting. Then i tried to make a new torrent for the file but everytime i click on upload i get a page not found error. So if you stick to upgrading to winrar 3.61 then go tools then to repair this will fix any mount or extract errors."
,gotbud,2006-12-04T03:50Z,"Disregard that last post please. It was made for the Eastern disk torrent at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3509074/Pioneer_AVIC_Navigation_Upgrade_CNDV-60MP_East_2006.rar
