XP Repair Pro 2006 scans and repairs over 53,000 common     
  Windows errors. An advanced registry optimizer removes useless  
  duplicate entries that Windows and other programs may leave.  
  XP Repair Pro 2006 will repair random PC crashes, error         
  messages, and can improve system performance by up to 750%.     
  After the system scan is completed you can view a complete      
  list of errors that were detected and choose to remove which    
  ones you would like or just let the Intelligence System         
  determine which should be removed. The Intelligence System not  
  only detects errors, but also analyzes each error against the   
  software installed on your computer to determine how that       
  error may affect other software. Version 3.1.6 repairs a        
  problem with the optimizer and changes the way the scan         
  handles startup entries.
