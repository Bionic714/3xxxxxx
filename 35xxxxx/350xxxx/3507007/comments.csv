Parts of South America has it's own culture and language varying greatly from Europe's Spain(although it's based  also on Spain's culture and the language is still very similar). To call it's culture , music and people Spanish is insulting. The next time you want to correct someone make sure you have your facts straight! adios! PS Latin is a dead language and Romans have been exchanged for Italians..."

rating:
acording to the covers, its a sony bmg promo disc. but you dont believe anything with torrentazos. but hijo_de_la_luna 2006 version at least makes this worth downloading. plenty of big names here, cant be the only good song

Makes you wonder what Luke771 does for his day job."
