,FlankerB1,2009-08-02T19:14Z,"grey-boy, where did you see that audio is separated from video? these are normal dvd files. Just use nero burning rom to burn a dvd video disc (dvd video option) at lowest speed allowed by your burner. vob files contain video, audio and subtitles, and ifo/bup files tell any hardware or software dvd player how to play them."
