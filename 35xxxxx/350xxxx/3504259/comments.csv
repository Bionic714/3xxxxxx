Johnny Orcface: most of them are in 192kbps, some even higher. Only one live record are in real low quality. 

"
,parlyzone,2006-08-20T16:35Z,"Dont worry, no 128 kbps shit(!)...

But you will get the highest audio quality with 198 kbps rips... It'll reduce the sound noticeably if you rip it 320kbps...

I Did'nt rip the cd's myself so it's a mix of things..."

,zappo23,2009-01-24T15:02Z,"@ redwall

The reason that ""Link"" is not on there is because System didn't do that song.  It was done by a band called The Rabbit Joint.  The singer just sounds a lot like Serj, and that's why absolutely EVERYONE thinks they did it."
