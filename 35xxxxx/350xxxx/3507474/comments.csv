here you can find subs. next time if you wish to find subs, just google ""subtitles [title of film/feature]"" and find a matching one. there is often more than one option for a download, just check howmany files the videofile is, the size etc.

,biggerthanjamesdean,2006-10-08T15:50Z,very cool film btw!
,biggerthanjamesdean,2006-10-08T15:51Z,additional information: it often works best if you rename the subtitles to match the file of the videofile (leave the *.avi and *.srt of course..)

,maxvi,2008-04-26T23:32Z,"Any Macintosh user CAN, INDEED, display movie subtitles and it's very easy! The first posible way is to use the free, open source Perian CODEC for QuickTime (also loads up tons of video formats to iTunes, FrontRow, QuickTime and displays beautiful subtitles). If you don't want to mess up with your QuickTime settings (like you're into video editting or something) just play your vidz with VLC. Both are free, quick to set up and easy to use!"
