,SeK612,2006-08-01T12:58Z,It must have as it\'s being seeded I guess...

It's a shame to see the site go down, but Grundy's laywers probably scared them. I'm surprised it rang for so long to be honest!!

I think maybe we could all have a private email list. 

The files could be uploaded to megaupload or rapidshare everyday and the link could be emailed around? 

What do you think? please reply to the usenet group - alt.tv.neighbours

My bittorrent is blocked at work/uni so I can't do that, but thanks anyway...

I might organise that actually..."
,LondonOntGuy,2006-08-01T22:24Z,"I was talking with SS just yesterday about this, and I suggested he also post to Alt.Binaries.Sliders it's been a dead group ever since BT caught on as the way to download that show. While Alt.Binaries.Multimedia is a good group, there's way too much stuff posted for it to be navigated, unless you have a premium news server. 

And here's one site, http://neighboursdownload.moonfruit.com/ this is the guy that flamed SS for taking it down.

There's also www.diwana.org, it's a private site that just recently allowed for new registrations for us Neighbours fans refugees. It may not be for everyone though, as it's only for NZ and Aus tv.

And yes, it was a shame. I almost had all of 2005's episodes downloaded, only a few more to go for December. But I pretty much know what happens anyways.  "
