,pjtmoi,2006-07-08T03:38Z,Why ?
,Temptation,2006-07-08T06:18Z,"pjtmoi, I think MattiP is trying to be sarcastic because you put this in the wrong category.  The ""Movies DVDR"" is for full DVDs, whereas a DVD rip, i.e., avi files, should be in the category ""Movies video"".

Is this in English? "
,pjtmoi,2006-07-08T07:05Z,"Thank's Temptation and excuse my mistake, I'm new in Torrent stuff... How can I change that ?

Yes, in English. Full V.O.

How can I change that ?"
,Temptation,2006-07-09T00:56Z,"pjtmoi,

Don't worry about it :)  Everyone makes mistakes.  It's generous of you to upload and share something.  Ignore the rude a**holes.  Unfortunately, uploading is mostly a thankless task.  You'll get a few thanks if you're lucky, but a lot of complaints otherwise.

As far as changing the category, unfortunately I don't think you can do that after you've uploaded something.  You could delete this upload and then re-upload it in the correct category, but that would mean people who have already downloaded this torrent and are in the middle of getting this will then not be able to complete it.  It's up to you about what you want to do, I guess.  To delete a torrent, go to your ""preferences"" page and select this torrent.  On the upper corner right, you'll see a red X.  Click on that to delete this torrent.  You can then re-upload it if you wish in the proper category."
