It is still seeded, but it might take a while for seeds to migrate to tpb. "

,RainbowCemetery,2009-01-02T04:49Z,i definitely wouldn't call this a love-sim. more of a horror/mystery themed visual novel. really creepy and entertaining though
,Miqunator,2012-04-09T11:06Z,"I wouldn't call this a love-sim either, it's basically about 5 people (or is it 6 or 7?) trapped in an undersea amusement park thingy. Although it's present love isn't really the focus in this Visual Novel, it's more like an added spice than anything (and there are no H scenes either).

I'd say the central part in this is the Mind Screw it pulls on the viewer right up to the end. It's all good though and the True End untangles the whole story pretty nicely (and is ridiculously happy to boot)."
