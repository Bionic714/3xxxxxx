There are people who actually want to watch this, so please seed the this DVD completely... and you can delete after you're done seeding. Thank you."

,Kit_Walker,2008-07-03T07:27Z,"Before downloading, be aware: this is not an actual DVD rip, it's a compilation of episodes recorded during their air-time on Toonami. As such the episodes are not quite DVD quality and there are Network logos on screen at all times as well as at the start and ad break sections of each episode."
