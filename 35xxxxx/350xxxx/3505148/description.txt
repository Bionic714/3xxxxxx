As requestet:

This is the full FlightDeck III release from Simaviator (known under Carrier Ops II, too) with ArrCab v2.53. The installer is in German, but it should be easy to install. Latest patch included.

-> simaviator.com/co/co.shtml

If this should be a problem, i have the Abacus release in france language, too. But the .iso file is bigger because it include demos.

-> abacuspub.com/catalog/s511.htm


Note: It is the same software just other language!
