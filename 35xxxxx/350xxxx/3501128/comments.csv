,lechtard,2006-08-17T08:00Z,"There is supposed to be two versions of the movie; The mini series and the movie. The Miniseries was, I think, four hours long; the movie, which I have on dvd, is only 2 1/2 hours long .. 

I been looking for the miniseries, so I hope this is the ""Actual"" one .. "

Thanks!!!"
,RayLike,2008-01-31T10:52Z,"Genial, para ser antigüa está muy bien lograda, sólo he visto el DVD 1 y sólo encontré un error de trama, todo lo demás va muy bien.

PD.: Lástima que no la vi de pequeño, realmente me hubiese asustado."

,shadowman2,2009-12-03T23:48Z,"Hey guys this is a peer to peer - it means we share.

If we don't share this damn torrent will die and we will only have 37%. I'm downloading at 2 or 3 KB/s and up loading at 30 !!

When the seed comes on line share the wealth or you and me won't get 100%"
,shadowman2,2009-12-06T15:18Z,"Wow!! This is truly amazing, I'm now at 40.5% and have been downloading 24/7 since I started a week ago. Downloaded 2.86 gigs, uploaded 10.9 gigs!!

Out of the 5 leechers on line, no one has more than 41.7% at the mo, but collectively we have 57%. We could do with some sharing people - especially from you Polish downloaders !!!

This sucks.................."
,jadasneez,2011-08-26T22:08Z,wow 50% in 5 hours and now 17 kB/s. can you guys maybe seed for more than an hour at a time...
