200 years ago, Inuyasha's father sealed away a powerful demon from China named Hyoga. Now a Shikon Jewel Shard has freed Hyoga's son, Menomaru. Menomaru plans to break the seal placed onto his father's remains in order to absorb his power and take control of the world. But to do that, he needs Inuyasha's sword. It's now up to Inuyasha and his friends to stop this nearly invincible foe.
