,aigjis1,2008-12-08T13:25Z,"Thats right. Here is original tracklisting of this compilation Best of Accept [1983]

        1.	Burning  
	2.	Restless and Wild  
	3.	Son of a Bitch  
	4.	Breaker  
	5.	Do It  
	6.	I'm a Rebel  
	7.	China Lady  
	8.	Not Time to Lose  
	9.	Princess of the Dawn  
	10.	Lady Lou 

But there exists another versio of ""Best of Accept"", special edition [1985], probably it was double CD. 
I had this at home in tape (not in audio cassette but in the big one).
I cant find it anywhere else at CD quality.:(
There was one ballad song which one not released at any of Accept albums."
