,phishvideos,2006-08-06T05:57Z,Thanks...I have recently wondered about this.
,JohnDoe123456,2007-02-21T13:42Z,"""902,417 people exactly. no more. no less.""
Good one."
,conrouss,2007-03-02T19:35Z,Greaat!!!!!!
,whyyoutellmeno,2007-04-05T09:17Z,Thanks !! A friend was just telling me about this and how it helped them 
,grindin247,2007-05-25T04:41Z,Is this the ENTIRE set?
,5cardstud,2007-05-28T06:59Z,"Yes, it is the entire set."
,5cardstud,2007-06-13T10:47Z,"lxor:  I think you misunderstood what was happening.  The first few chapters are motivational -- they want you to complete the course.  But it's not an infomercial -- this is the set.  The tape is intended to be used with the workbook (also included).  Each session has a ""group"" session with real people, so that you can hear the different perspectives.  "
,Lilia13,2007-08-15T19:28Z,"Can someone, please, seed this again?
Thank you."
,Lilia13,2007-08-15T22:15Z,"It says ""access denied"". How can I download it?

,Carlsko,2007-09-17T21:58Z,"Why can't I listen to some of the tapes? For example in the third, fourth and seventh chapter. It says the name of the file is not guilty??"

Where? If this thing helps with no valium needed, please point me in the right direction!
Thanx!"
,Informante,2008-04-26T01:53Z,"Damn, listening to a bunch of emos instead of finding any valuable help. SCREW this piece of shit! Another scam to make profit of people with anxiety. Why would we get any better from listening to some emos complaint about their own problems. This sucks balls."
,suisenbenjo,2008-10-16T19:21Z,Thanks. I actually bought this program but it's on cassette tapes and I don't own a player so this is saving me from having to go out and buy one just for this.
,hunnie33,2008-12-31T16:12Z,"Thanks so much for this.  How can I get the missing ones?  So far I am missing 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3?  So far that is all I have found that is missing but I think I saw there are more missing..."
,mpjbay,2012-04-17T01:55Z,thank you. I guess I need these right now :(
,kaieous,2012-07-03T19:45Z,"I don't even care if it's missing some. I use these tapes at therapy, but I hear less than a full lesson a week - I can't afford to go to therapy more, and I definitely couldn't afford to buy the program right now. (Anxiety makes it hard to work!) Lucinda Bassett makes sense, makes jokes, and just makes me feel better. So thank you thank you so much for uploading this. "
