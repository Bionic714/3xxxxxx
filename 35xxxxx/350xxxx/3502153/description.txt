Amazon.co.uk Review
Nerina Pallot is probably one of a handful of new artists of 2001 guaranteed to send your pop-socks flying sky-high. Nerina's debut, Dear Frustrated Superstar is full of beautiful melodies, intelligent lyrics and a sweet, sweet voice. Various issues are tackled by the album including fear, headache, birth and death, and with titles such as "Daily Bread", "Blood Is Blood" and "God", religion also gets a thorough critiquing too. The applicability of Nerina's work for everyday life is further highlighted by the track "Patience" which is the ideal tune to hum when assembling an IKEA flat-pack or while stuck in a traffic jam ("...I need a little patience..."). Equally accessible and just as catchy is "Alien", which is a personal favourite of Nerina and described by her as her "special ginger-haired child". The best cut is saved almost until last with "My Last Tango" which soars and swings along with the help of a 50 piece orchestra. Plenty of comparisons have been drawn between Nerina and Alanis but Dear Frustrated Superstar is probably more comparable to a tidied-up Tori Amos. --John Galilee
