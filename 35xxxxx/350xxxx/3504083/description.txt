Running time: 42 mins.

This is the iPod version of a torrent I released a week ago, you can also watch this comfortably on your computer, using your normal media player. Although the video quality is not as good as the full 770MB version, the vocals are now completely in sync with the video and sound is just as good. I've also cropped the gaps from either side of the screen, so when you view it in full screen, the video fills the whole of the screen and is no longer boxed.

Please seed this torrent after you have downloaded it, my uploading capacity isn't very good, so I need you good sports to seed at least as much as you download!
