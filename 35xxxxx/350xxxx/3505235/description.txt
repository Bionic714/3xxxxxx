Full Blown Rose is a rock band which began in New York City. Members include Josephine Conigliaro (lead singer), Matthieu Lechevalier (drums) and Josh Allen (guitar). They are relatively unknown, with small contributions to a few movie soundtracks (Elektra, Seed of Chucky) however a much anticipated album release is expected to change that. The anticipation is mostly spurred by the very well-received release of some original songs on their official site.
