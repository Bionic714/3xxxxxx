,CalebThePirate,2006-12-23T12:53Z,Is it so damn hard to use no-cd cracks? It is better to do that then mount in DT.
,Mikaelsson_A,2007-01-06T21:25Z,när jag installerar no-cd cracket så stängs det bara ner ;S. hur ska jag göra ? jag har mountat det och prövat också. blir likadant
,seprah,2007-01-08T11:59Z,To get this game to work you have to burn it to cd. You then have to copy the cracked exe and override the original. The cracked exe is in the crack folder on the cd but you can't copy it because its read only! I had to use isobuster and extract it from the iso to copy it.

,x_spec,2007-10-25T06:12Z,"If anyone have problem installing or downloading this HOT game here some suggestions:

BURN IT TO A CD!

just go to google and type in shit like: Burn ISO to CD. and usually some converter would show up and just download that shit and burn playboy game to a blank disc. (2 discs remember)

after ye burn those two iso. files to disc, close whatever shit u r doing and take out the CDs.

and then re-insert disc 1 into your CD/DVD drive. and the install window will pop-up. INSTALL that shit. and then used that crack shit in your CD and copy paste it into the right folder. 

END"

,Onowh,2008-09-24T02:32Z,"THERES NO BURNING OR EXTRA PROGRAMS REQUIRED FOR THIS GAME TO RUN.

1. Once d/l is finished, extract both RAR files.

2. OPEN THE ""CRACK"" FOLDER AND COPY THE FILE.

2. Go back to the folder where all the files are and Click on AUTORUN and chose INSTALL.

3. When d/l installation completes, X out of the game and go to youre PROGRAMS FOLDER.

4. PASTE THE CRACK

YOURE DONE.

go open that bitch and play..."

,omfgzsik,2009-06-06T19:10Z,"There is a bug in gameplay. I am unable to access 'Mansion Screen' which I suppose to buy furnitures.

I tried installing this on my Windows 7 but it does not support this game. So I went to install it on Windows Vista. 

Any solutions for the bug above?"
,pam_09,2009-06-09T12:40Z,"Hey, I'm having the same problem as TheifDark, but unfortunately I haven't managed to fix it. If anyone could give me any advice I'd really appreciate it! :)
Thanks!"
,omfgzsik,2009-06-10T02:48Z,"Nevermind. I did a little bit of research and I found the solution.

Whoever that has the same problem, read this.

This is a little quoting from the site, ""Going into the Mansion Menu when the user has set the video resolution higher than 1024x768, causes a crash."" So we need to patch it.
Download its v1.01 patch here, http://games.softpedia.com/get/Patch/Playboy-the-Mansion-Patch.shtml"
,pam_09,2009-06-12T13:01Z,"Hey, I probably should've explained my problem. I downloaded the game, and copied the crack file. However everytime I click on it, it goes to a black screen as if something is about to load, then goes straight back to my desktop. I've looked up the error and the problem is 'PCA2'. Can't seem to find any solution to this on the web; any help would be greatly appreciated as I spent ages downloading this & don't fancy doing it again! :)"
