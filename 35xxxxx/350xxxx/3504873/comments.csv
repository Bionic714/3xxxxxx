No need of the cds of Gothic II to play the game. You can place it wherever you feel like."

,ulmez,2008-05-18T22:31Z,"Hey silverBlitz,

If you look at my first comment at the top you will see that you do not start the game with ""Gothic2.exe"" in the System mapp, it's the ""GothicStarter.exe"" in the System mapp you will start the game. Then in the new window that will pop up you double click on ""Gothic II The Night of The Raven"" line, and not the one in German (not Gothic II - Die Nacht des Raben). That will do the trick."
