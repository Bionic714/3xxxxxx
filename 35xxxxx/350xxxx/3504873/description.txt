This version of "Gothic 2" and the expansion "The Night of The Raven" I have fixed so the language is in german and the subtitle in english for both versions.

As you know if you are a Gothic fan and not of german origin you were stuck with to have a mix of german language and english when you played Gothic 2 with the expansion The Night of The Raven. But know I have fixed that problem so you Gothic lovers can get a much more genuine experience of the game.

Have much fun!
