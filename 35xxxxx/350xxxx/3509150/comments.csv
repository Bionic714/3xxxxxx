,wankan,2006-08-03T07:44Z,"Another fine example of ""The amazing disappearing seeder trick"" . 267 peers mostly stuck at 29% for the last day . Seem to get a lot of this recently . "
,Konstigthuvud,2006-08-03T09:30Z,"How the fu** do you add new torrents? When I click on Upload torrent I only get a blank page.

:"
,wankan,2006-08-03T11:59Z,I haven't been able to add torrents since the police raid . I always time out so have given up trying . Pity .
,Mr_Ecks,2006-08-03T18:08Z,"black math >> Simmilar things has happened. According to lore, the site was down for nine days when one sysadmin got drunk and did some creative programing."
,Mr_Ecks,2006-08-03T18:15Z,I hope it's not police related this time though. Meanwhile try www.isohunt.com
,Yin-Yang 92,2006-08-03T18:32Z,"Morons, read the BLOG!"
,wankan,2006-08-03T22:18Z,Doesn't explain why this torrent is stuck at 29% for 2 days . Other torrents have worked recently .
,Mr_Ecks,2006-08-04T08:42Z,"Ok... The bogg say's:


Some upgrades are being done...
... so we might be unstable for a couple of hours. The upload function is not working at the moment, but please stay tuned! We'll report in the blog when everything is working as it should again. Thanks!
"
,_Seth_,2006-08-04T11:46Z,Well....some hours became days... i guess it`s the price we have to pay for having free downloads. All respect to the Pirate bay crew!  :-)
,Mr_Ecks,2006-08-04T12:59Z,wankan>> That is probably becouse the original seeder got fed up and abandoned it. It happens and it's a pisser.
,wankan,2006-08-04T18:33Z,Why get fed up . It was running well up to 29% . I haven't had any trouble with the colbert report etc . Can't be the database as it's tracking okay .
,wankan,2006-08-05T21:42Z,"Seeding has again commenced .
Thanks ."
,MeTRiDa,2006-08-05T22:49Z,"Hi everyone. I'm extremely sorry about not seeding, i've just moved home over the past week and couldn't seed again until i got internet at my new house. Thanks for being patient. I hope you enjoy this release if you have any feedback post on TPB or e-mail me.
