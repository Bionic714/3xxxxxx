,nytemare909,2006-08-06T10:34Z,Thanks for this one.. ;-).. Could anyone put up a PAL version of this movie??
,WHAT?!,2006-08-06T18:21Z,Seed snoogins
,m2dane,2006-08-06T22:56Z,does this contain the whole movie actually into the credits because the others i've seen always stop 10-20 minutes before the actual end of the movie
,manndrine,2006-08-07T00:27Z,this is the full movie
,WHAT?!,2006-08-07T01:15Z,hows the quality?
,manndrine,2006-08-07T02:43Z,"check the screenshots (links in the info)

,xaviel,2006-08-07T14:11Z,"Man, you must have a decent source, DVD quality with everything while its still in theatres."
,Sun3,2006-08-07T21:22Z,It's not dvd quality. It's a telesync.
,bechmann36,2006-08-07T22:00Z,seed damn it
,WHAT?!,2006-08-08T01:32Z,"Please Seed!! Stuck at 44.4%! 

Telesync is fine for now."
,manndrine,2006-08-08T15:47Z,"When I currently compress the DVD I am using the lowest setting. I can increase the zipage, but it will take longer for you to unzip... please let me know what you would prefer; as I have DVD release just about ready for upload.

So either:
 a) smaller download - longer unzip
 b) larger download - quicker unzip"
,celox,2006-08-08T17:37Z,"Heya manndrine,

I prefer a smaller download with longer unzip"
,celox,2006-08-08T20:56Z,Seed this puppy please thanks
,xtcrulez,2006-08-08T23:00Z,we need seeders...this has been up for a few days now and no one is seeding....it will die without seeders
,manndrine,2006-08-09T05:13Z,"theres an issue with my torrent creator... as of right now there is 1 seeder; 200 leechers; 1.612 copies avalible for download; and finally an average of 58.6% completed... 

by tomorrow morning/night a buttload of people should have the download finished...

till then, read some crappy blogs ;-)"
,zbeeblebro,2006-08-10T05:52Z,71.4% EVER so slow! but thanks for making it!
,celox,2006-08-10T15:35Z,"76.2%, hopefully I finished it tommorow.. and I'll seed this one for a long time"
,manndrine,2006-08-10T20:47Z,"for basic BT questions:

http://manndrine.googlepages.com/

(its still a work in progress)

there is a dvd-burn guide; basic, but its there."
,celox,2006-08-12T14:49Z,"Finished, will seed with as many kbs as i can, hf"
,m2dane,2006-08-13T04:02Z,when I burn it down the sound gets fucked anybody got any ideas on how to fix that problem?
,celox,2006-08-13T17:57Z,I burned it and all went well... maybe it's your codec?
,m2dane,2006-08-13T18:22Z,"what codec do you have?

i don't see why that would mess with dvd burning cause it plays fine on my computer but on a dvd player there's no sound from the movie but the menus are fine"
,manndrine,2006-08-15T04:17Z,"I cant remember - but i think it might be AC3?? But then again I cant remeber. Try buring another DVD at the slowest speed that your writer will go... that sometimes will fix ""bad"" burns."
,RD_Plissken,2006-08-18T06:16Z,"THERE IS NO DOLBY ENCODED AUDIO ON THIS DVD! ONLY LPCM STEREO, WHICH IS PLAIN .WAV FORMAT AND THAT'S A FUCKIN' FACT! DO NOT KID YOURSEFVES AROUND WITH ""WHAT CODEC IS IT"" STUFF... ONLY THING FUNNY ON THIS RELEASE IS THAT AWFUL ANTIPIRACY ADD ON BEGINNING OF DVD... MENUS, EXTRAS, WHATS THE POINT, WHEN IT' AIN'T EVEN A TELESYNC, WHATEVER THAT MEANS... IT IS A SHITTY QUALITY STRAIGHT FROM A 10TH ROW OF SOME CINEMA SOMEWHERE... AND THAT IS ANOTHER FUCKIN' FACT!"
,Karbala,2006-08-18T16:27Z,Is there any seeders  on this one?
,ravenloft994,2006-09-25T05:16Z,I down loaded it cant get to work hellp
,firepiper,2006-10-10T09:43Z,"Dont bother downloading. It's a DVD with trailers and doctrines in high quality and the film is a CAM, possibly shitty telecine!"
