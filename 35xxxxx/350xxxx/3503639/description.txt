Wing Chun, a woman living in a remote village often pillaged by robbers. When Wing Chun finally loses her cool and defeats them, her heroic actions stir up even more trouble in this male-based society of the time. The climactic battle to the death is a dazzler.

If anyone else has some of the Kung fu classics like warriors two or the prodigal son etc id really apreciate it if they could upload them!

enjoy
