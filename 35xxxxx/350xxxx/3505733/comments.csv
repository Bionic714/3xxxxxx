,theroyalist,2011-06-12T15:55Z,"ZhaavardZ, totally agree. These sorts of bands need our cash to pay the bills! That said, I did buy Severed Survival & Mental Funeral, 20 yrs ago...but on lousy tape! & a long-sleeved t!

Good news! ""new EP, entitled The Tomb Within, on September 13, 2010 and Macabre Eternal, their first studio album in 16 years, in 2011"" (wikipedia)"
