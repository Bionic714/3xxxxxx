Two best friends and ex-lovers, Beth and Susan, plan a reunion in Oregon. Their current lovers, Chloe and Jessie, feel alienated as their girlfriends plan to attend several work related seminars. Forced together, an intense attraction between Chloe and Jessie ignites a fiery affair, pitting stability, commitment and intimacy in their respective long-term relationships against the exhilaration and hypnotic passion of new love (or is it lust?) As feelings of guilt and remorse begin to surface, Chloe and Jessie deal with the ever-increasing risk of getting caught.
