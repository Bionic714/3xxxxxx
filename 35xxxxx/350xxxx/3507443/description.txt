Movie  Info:
A secret group of scientists have discovered the location of the 
famous lost city of Atlantis, but it's not on Earth. It's located 
in another galaxy altogether, the Pegasus galaxy. Stargate Atlantis, 
a spin-off from the highly successful Stargate SG-1 series, follows 
a multinational scientific and military group, lead by Diplomat 
Dr. Elizabeth Weir (played by actress Torri Higginson), headed on 
a one way trip to Atlantis. Their mission: to investigate the 
secrets of Atlantis, a city now known to have been built by 
ancient powerful beings, and bring whatever they discover back to 
Earth. They will be all on their own, with no means to return, 
with no means of rescue or support, unless they can find the 
technology they need in Atlantis to return them to Earth.
