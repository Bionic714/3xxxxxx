Brave Soul employs an action-RPG system, with parties of up to four characters moving over scrolling maps.

You select the enemies you want to attack with your sword or with ranged magic-based weapons,
or fight with the convenient "auto combat mode." Outfit your party, choose your quest, and work through challenging 
multi-level dungeons. Using a unique mission-based game system, you must lead your beautiful companions on dozens
 of campaigns in the wide world of Brave Soul as you search for the secret of the Moon Goddess. But you have to lead 
them well if you're to find the keys that unlock their hearts.
Brave Soul offers many advanced features for bishoujo gaming fans, including several difficulty settings, allowing you to

I've, creators of some of the most popular bishoujo game and anime soundtracks. It also features a fully animated opening
