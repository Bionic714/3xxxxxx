,LordMarduk,2008-09-02T20:37Z,"didnt work for me, installed and all and i got an error message, using win XP here"
,squidgoggle,2008-09-27T10:39Z,The exe file that comes with this game contains the virus w95.fono - When I try to install the game my trusty virus program removes the exe-file and I am thankful for that - do not install or run this on your system.
,tbteherror,2008-11-15T21:21Z,"This has a virus, AVG flagged brave_s.exe as Trojan Horse SHeur.CPXZ. You can believe me or not, but when you download this do a virus scan after mounting the image(scan the mounted image duh)."
,ammcneil,2009-01-10T08:04Z,"keep in mind folks that there IS such a thing as a false posative, and they DO appear in torrents quite often"
,themaskobscure,2009-02-10T00:02Z,"I'm pretty sure this one is clean. I mean, it's from a VIP member so I don't think they would upload a virus with that much attention."
,robertoII,2009-02-28T17:09Z,has anybody gotten this thing to run without any problems with the language or the installation whatsoever? replies are mush appreciated.
[T],Hgames,2009-03-13T13:59Z,http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4715252/Brave_Soul Yeah my release works but not on vista 64bit because vista 64bit does not support 16 bit installers. Anything else it works 100% and no virus.
,costoboy,2009-07-07T02:39Z,this game is fucking big
,SeppoD,2009-07-08T08:46Z,"The installation starts out fine, but 1/3 of the way through, it stops because of a problem with the exe. o-o  Anyone know how to fix this?"
,mahomedas,2009-08-26T00:29Z,cool sexy game thanks 4 uploaders ;)
,misschris828,2010-12-23T19:47Z,"If you download the patch with the brave_s.exe from peachprincess. This will fix any install issues. The install is in English. If you are having difficulty installing, if you explore it once it's mounted, there will be a folder labeled ""brave_s"" Copy everything from that folder but the 'brave_s.exe' to a folder under programfiles>brave_s and extract all items from the peachprincess update to there as well and voila! It should work. I hope this helps :D"
,StINGULARITy,2012-05-24T00:58Z,"If you can't get it to work...  mount with d-tools or alcohol.  The regular Windows emulator and poweriso didn't work when I tried installing.

Hah sounds like a good signature. 
  (Mount with alcohol and d-tools)"
