How about seeding though?

Are you planning to upload kieslowskis "" La double vie de Veronique """
,krzulu,2006-07-04T10:18Z,"Unless something has gone wrong in the basement at home, I am seeding (and if something has gone wrong I will be seeding tonight). 

Actually I am super-seeding, which may be why your client is reporting me as not seeding. "
,krzulu,2006-07-04T10:19Z,"I don't have any other kieslowskys, but I am planning to seed some other interesting frence stuff the moment my seed matures."
,kgbteddy,2006-07-08T01:00Z,"OK I got them krzulu!

Thank's again for this great upload. I haven't seen these flicks since they ran at the theatres!!

Keep up the good work."
