,MisanthropeMojo,2006-07-13T04:33Z,Is this for real I see seeds for parts 1 and 2 like always but no seeds still for 3 & 4 and its been a week since this has been uploaded. Anybody have a completed 3 or 4?
,prde,2006-07-13T12:39Z,"I'm seeding all episodes, but sometimes I'm not visible as seeder (I don't know why?). Don'n worry, all bits of this episodes you will receive from peers who are uploading from me."
,MisanthropeMojo,2006-07-13T12:58Z,Thanx Prde its good to know somebody is finally seeding this.
,koncÃ¤rn,2007-08-13T11:41Z,"I'm seeding this as well. But I'm thinking seriously about stopping. What is the matter with you? You fucking wine about seeders when you download parts 1-3 then you don¨t seed yourself. Seed about 1,0 before you start on the next one or I¨ll stop seeding and this torrent dies."
