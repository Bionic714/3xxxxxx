,HabbyHebbo,2006-08-08T10:59Z,"It's a great movie, makes other biblical film seem like childplay. He was a real, he suffered for our sins. Few of us suffer nowdays more than spotting a spoiled milk in the fridge.

To feel, to understand the sacrifice. The one who truly was without a sin opened the way for us sinners to better ourselfs.

Sadly, Jews don't accept him as a such, and also killed him there.  "

,flatlegs,2007-10-01T16:04Z,Why are christians such uptight wankers???
,Kyfus,2007-10-10T17:35Z,"cederlund: Your such a stupid person who doesn't think. God has never been disaproved or proved with facts. So there is no fucking way someone can know he doesnt exist ... the people that do that simply have never experienced anything holy in their life yet. 

On other hand there are millions who do experience something, and do believe there is a god and do believe in things that happens as miracles etc. 

And yes, there are also millions who do ""believe"" in god and call themselfs muslims/christians/jews or w/e but never actually experienced anything ""holy"" or something. Just playing along with their famillies etc. 

But why not just let everyone believe what they want for fuck sache? 

And Cederlund, your probably just a little kid of like 13 years old who shouldn't even be waching such Mel Gibson movie. Go home and cry little wanker, you dont know anything .. grow some years before speaking. ty"

P.S. Subtitles are Spanish or English, just like it says.

Thanks anyway."
