
This is about the 16 millionth time I've uploaded an improved version of
this - hopefully the last for a while =P

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a rip of a Sega Mega-CD Promotional VHS cassette that I picked up
at a car boot sale in late 2004. No idea when it was made, or who it was
released to, or indeed anything else about it for that matter. The only
significant marking is on the cardboard case, which reads: "SEGA MEGA-CD
- GAMES WITHOUT FRONTIERS" - a scan of this is included with the torrent.
One of the only things I do know about it is that Games Without Frontiers
is a song by Peter Gabriel. His CD "Shaking the Tree" also makes an
appearance near the end of the video (I can't belive I just wrote that).
