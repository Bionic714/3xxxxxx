,sfacets,2006-09-05T06:51Z,Yet more spam/propaganda by the followers of the druggie/egomaniac/lunatic. Enjoy.
,Schopenhauer,2006-09-13T04:52Z,"For fucks sake!! Why not mention that the file actually needs to be renamed in order to work! The file has to be renamed with the "".exe"" extention added. Great upload anyway, Osho  is cool the most enlighted pimp there ever was, the chick loved his beard... "
,weareall1,2007-02-28T19:55Z,"This is an EXE file!?

It is never wise to download executable files.

How do we know that it does not contain a virus?

Google these words:  safe and unsafe file extensions "
,digital_apocalypse,2007-04-16T00:32Z,"weareall1, you scan it with your anti-virus."
,perlinpinpin,2007-05-31T23:30Z,"Pfff...
N'importe quoi ! De la propagande de secte. Les tenants du dĂŠfunt Osho ne savent plus quoi inventer. Lamentable.
Il y a des traditions spirituelles authentiques, autre que ce genre d'illuminĂŠ."
,JohnnyProblemsolver,2008-10-19T01:41Z,"damnit just make it pdf !!!
im not trying this, fuck this. fucking installers. Why??/ Only makes file biggger than necessary. "
,vladmir21,2009-05-14T04:15Z,"in response to cappie's comment, im downloading this file now, and will report on if it contains a virus or not.
The download speed is pretty low, like 1 kbps, so its going to take me a week to download according to utorrent.

in any case, cappie's torrent link for the same file above works.
this filesize is 150,973 KB,
while the one posted by cappie is 151,173 KB."
,vladmir21,2009-05-16T07:19Z,"100% VIRUS-FREE!!
TESTED AND WORKS GREAT!!
@ cappie
you are a LIAR, saying that the file contains a trojan.
I have run several antivirus/trojans against the file nothing came up. 
i have then installed the application, 
and it works beautifully, 
with no malicious programs hiding anywhere.

Smae on you for accusing that this file contains a trojan, just so that people can download your file! its the same file!! 
THIS VERSION POSTED HERE IS A LATER VERSION!
1.0.0.6 whereas the one posted by cappie is 1.0.0.0

AGAIN, TESTED WORKING AND SAFE!"

,HeyNonnyNonnyNonnyMus,2010-09-10T22:18Z,"Osho was formerly known as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and his 'teachings' led members of his cult to poison over 700 people in The Dalles, OR in 1984. He changed his name after he was deported from the U.S., but his 'teachings' are the same - dangerous and insane."
