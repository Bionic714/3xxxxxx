Frontline flea treatment contains Fipronil.  It remains effective even after bathing or swimming.   Frontline Top Spot kills most fleas before they bite, which is great for pets suffering from flea allergies.  Frontline also kills ticks.  Applied between the shoulder blades, Frontline kills fleas and ticks for 30 days or more.  Safe to use on puppies at ten weeks and kittens at 12 weeks of age, when used as directed.

Fipronil, the powerful active ingredient in Frontline flea treatment, collects naturally in the hair follicles and oil-producing glands of the skin, where it remains protected from removal by shampooing or swimming.  Then it continually reapplies itself to the hair, providing long lasting control for a month or more.

Frontline flea treatment is packaged with 3 separate applications per pack, a three month supply for one pet.Frontline Topspot for Cats
