,NuRome,2009-12-27T14:22Z,"I hate complaining but this is more of a jab at the commenterz; I see this all the time with comments on videos, no one actually comments on the quality. iow, is it good or not? A=? V=? or in the case of Audio torrents ID tagged properly? and kbps? Not trying to be a jerky McJerkface, but it would help out a lot. Thank you my fellow buccaneers."
