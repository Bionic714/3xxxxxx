,Grimm Reaper,2006-08-07T20:58Z,"i hate to be the bringer of bad news, but there seems to be a problem with the office 2003 file, i tryed to instal it and when it said ""windows is configuring office 2003"", the percentage started to decrease at about 99%, then it closed it self on me when it reached zero, i have tryed to figure out how to fix it but to no end, so....does anyone have sugestions as to how to fix this problem?"
,coolman01231,2006-08-08T17:13Z,Worked Great~!
,katt85,2006-08-10T00:48Z,This worked great! Thank you. 
,arend jan,2006-08-14T17:42Z,"THANK YOU!!!
The download of the year!

@Grimm Reaper: I had the same problem. You have to uninstall an older version first, that's all!"
,lopas1,2006-08-18T10:51Z,Do i need to uninnstall Microsoft Works? Cuz i rather not.
,milsurp,2006-08-22T05:06Z,"Worked perfectly, easiest thing iI ever installed or downloaded off limerwire or torrent."
,miK_,2006-08-30T19:42Z,It works so well... *wipes tears out his eyes*
,JohnCrichton,2006-09-01T10:05Z,"Unable to get it to work for me, kept on getting this error message:
Product: Microsoft Office Professional Edition 2003 -- Error 1308. Setup cannot find the required file C:\DOCUME~1\USER\LOCALS~1\Temp\7zS38.tmp\FILES\PFILES\MSOFFICE\OFFICE11\ACCWIZ.DLL.

[T],bi20,2006-09-06T15:34Z,so easy to install!!!!
,kit600ana,2006-09-19T05:29Z,"OK YEAH uncompresses and then does nothing, no new programs no icons nothing, so i would love to know how everyone is saying YES SO AWESOME when it does not do anything."
,solitary415,2006-09-20T02:44Z,I'M NEW TO HIS SITE AND I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT I NEED TO DO AFTER I DL THIS TO TRY TO GET IT TO INSTALL.. DO I NEED ANOTHER PROGRAM TO DO IT? WINDOWS IS TELLING ME IT DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THE FILE TYPE? FORGIVE ME FOR I AM PC ILLITERATE. HELP! SOMEONE!
[T],bi20,2006-09-25T16:24Z,"solitary, you need uTorrent to download the real program, here you just get ""office2003.torrent""

kit, sorry to hear that it didn't work for you. I did for me :P"
,BurnHouse,2006-09-30T23:09Z,"I've had the HUGEST problem installing this file. My suggestion is that if you've ever had Office on your computer, don't bother trying to download this because it's almost impossible to get the older version off."
,paultaki,2006-10-10T05:41Z,"lol...ok so I admit, i was in doubt...
So I have office 2003 basic, but I needed powerpoint for a work project on my home computer.

After reading the comments I wasn't sure I should download this because some people had issues.

I did get an error but after clicking ok it did the full install, it works like a charm...and such a small file...

This is the best thing I've downloaded yet!  I will seed it!"
,V5Spectre,2006-10-14T14:32Z,Can you get orher languages besides english?
,muddy_waters,2006-10-25T04:53Z,paultaki did you have to unistall office xp before you installed this download.
,diane1974,2006-10-28T16:20Z,"This was the easiest. Click use thats how easy.,.,Thanks Great Uppy!!!"
,coquihalla,2006-11-23T00:10Z,"Thanks so much! Had no problems whatsoever. I did delete my old defunct 2003 program as someone suggested and things are perfect.

Thanks again!"
,hordak,2006-11-27T11:41Z,"Well, seems to me as it's not the pro-ver. since that one includes, among others frontpage, visio, publisher etc. But wth, it says clearly in the header what apps it includes :)
Question, though, is foreign language spelling included (swedish for example)?
Thx!"
,mrgeek95616,2006-12-04T10:42Z,"shit man, ... this is the fastes fucking torrent I have ever downladed i got it in fucking 20 min"
,Jimplay,2006-12-15T05:37Z,"This file downloaded reasonably fast for me,Living out in the boonies I have to use dialup.Installed without no probs. Works great. thanks for the upload"
,jamole222,2006-12-26T17:52Z,Thanks mate seems to be working GREAT THANKS !!!! :)
,valentinorosi,2006-12-28T21:51Z,This is amazing. It totally works. No need for s/n its all included in this self-extracting file. Thanks for the seed. 
,evilshenzero,2007-01-10T03:31Z,"runs amazing, perfect.  no s/n or anything."
,sisteczko,2007-01-13T13:59Z,"I have the following two questions:
1. How to make my own MS Office compilation (I live in non-English speaking country, and would prefer non-English version. And installing the MUI over it would just compromise the idea of making the MS Office compact)
2. What specific components were deleted? E.g. is VBA Included?"
,Rizzle789,2007-02-02T17:44Z,Why can't I open this file....
,diegodude,2007-02-24T00:26Z,"Great stuff, this was a lifesaver."
,baresurfer,2007-03-24T04:42Z,"Ok, I have to admit that this is the best download I have made till now. Fast, working (really contains what is ""advertised"") and, as far as I could notice, there is no malware. Hopefully it won't  present any kind of troubles within the near future."
,55578,2007-06-02T17:35Z,PERFECT! Wow. Small FAST install. Works great but does not pass WGA. You will need to google for ogacheckcontrol.dll and dump it in your SYSTEM32 dir then GREAT! This patch works with 2003 & 2007!
,DrrtyRascal,2007-06-27T16:35Z,"This is definitely the best version of Office 2003 I've downloaded.  Not because it has every single Office 2003 app (it doesn't), but because of its compact size and ease of installation.  When you invoke the .exe file (self extracing archive), it will install all the apps listed.  Small and fast.  Thanks, Scrunto!"
,Black_Rage,2007-07-13T20:52Z,"Thanx mate, keep up the god work."
