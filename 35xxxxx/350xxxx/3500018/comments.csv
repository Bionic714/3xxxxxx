,NeverRAR,2006-07-29T15:45Z,"nwadel, you used the crack that was on the disc-image right?"
,warreng777,2006-07-31T09:09Z,Anybody knows where I can download a patch for this version of dreamfall? The game crashes in chapter 7 after the altar... 
,nwadel,2006-08-02T02:07Z,"I went into the No cd file, copied the Dreamfall application, pasted it in the Dreamfall file (which replaced the one that installed) and it doesn't run, it just gives an error that it crashed and to send the dmp & txt files to funcom. Did i do it right?"
,NeverRAR,2006-08-02T22:03Z,"nwadel,

It seems correct.

It also seems like there are more than a few people having problems with this game.
I'd recommend searching the web for bugfixes and/or check some forums about compability (this goes for all of you with probs)."
,NeverRAR,2006-08-02T22:03Z,"It might be that your gfx card is too old or that your drivers aren't updated for example.

Sorry I can't be of more help than that."
,niborn,2006-08-28T00:55Z,when I have read the license agreement and pushed the next button it says that I don't have enough space to install. but I hadn't even chose where the game should be installed and I have 170gb free!!!
,Zarbotac,2006-09-02T18:33Z,Can someone explain what to do with the cue and bin file? I tried to burn it in NERO but I got a new nrg file??? Help!!!
,Tantonta,2006-09-05T15:00Z,This torrent has a Trojan downloader in it.
,NeverRAR,2006-09-08T12:42Z,"niborn,
this is a common problem with this game. If you don't have enough free space on your first drive, it won't even let you choose where to install.
Look on the internet and you'll find a fix.

Zarbotac,
You need to choose something like ""burn from image"". I'm not sure how to do it exactly in Nero, since I use Ashampoo Burning Studio 6, which I think is much better.

Tantonta,
And your mother has my **** up her ***.
There is NO trojan in this. I'm 99% sure. My antivirus hasn't complained and no one else who downloaded this has complained either.

Seemingly, there are those who enjoy typing ""this is a trojan"" on every torrent they find. Myself, I find this really annoying since I wish to know which torrents are secure and which are not. But I guess my own antivirus is the only one I can rely on nowdays."
,Norwegianange,2006-09-11T21:04Z,"Hei,
Thanks a lot for the game. Works perfect for me... except that when I get to Winter (and that crazy girl scares the hell out of me... The Ring inspired???)... the game crashes... that means the graphics get fucked up but I can still move, pick up things and even fight some shitty monsters... any help I can get?"
,NeverRAR,2006-09-19T19:14Z,"Norwegianange,
I have heard of someone else with a similar problem at a different place in the game.
Unfortunately I can't help more than to recommend you to upgrade your gfx-drivers and reinstall the latest directx (if this game needed dx, don't rember)."
,Luona,2006-10-17T12:18Z,"Can't get it to work. Just getting upp an error message: wrong disc inserted, please insert the original ""dreamfall cd/dvd.
Downloaded the file but can only see 2 files, dvd-file and .cue file. Can't find the crack. :/
Any suggestions?

*Using Daemon Tools*"
,NeverRAR,2006-10-21T15:06Z,"Luona,
Yes, you should mount the "".cue""-file with daemon-tools (which then links to the "".bin""-file in the same directory).

...or you could of course mount the .bin directly (don't know if there's any difference really)...

As the DVD is mounted you should find my .nfo-file on the disc, the .nfo from PLEX and the .nfo from Reloaded. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, you should find the crack for the game on there too, which you will need to be able to play."

""Hello,
Apparently if you install Dreamfall, and if the drive of your default install directory (usually like c:\program files\) does not have 7 gigs free, it will not even let you get to the screen where you can choose a different drive/partition.

This is pretty annoying, and backwards, since it should let you choose a drive, before it checks to see if there is enough space.
Here is how you can change your default windows install directory to allow it to install your game.

Go to Start -> Run:
Type RegEdit

Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Curr entVersion

On the right side is something called: ProgramFilesDir

*Write down the current path of the ProgramFilesDir, you'll need to change it back after install*

Change this value to a drive that contains 7+ gigs of space

Install Dreamfall

*Go back into the Registry, to ProgramFilesDir, and change it's value back to what it originally was.*

Don?t mess up your registry by doing anything else.

,punkster91,2007-09-13T18:03Z,"done!
i've found out how to repair this.. if you don't have enough space on your primary drive.
1.go to start, run... and type ""regedit""
2.enter HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, SOFTWARE, Microsoft, Windows, CurrentVesrion
3.on yor right you'll find ""ProgramFilesDir""
4.change it to your secondary drive, and install where you have more space.

NOTE: After instalation change back to the way it was because this might affect other programs"

I'm currently still downloading the game.
Could you please give me a step by step procedure on how to use daemon tools to get this game to work so that i'll be able to play after installing it? i'm kinda confused about all this mounting business. and what version of daemon tools do i download?

Sorry, i'm so lost. Kinda new to this stuff.
