Since the old one was gone, I'm now uploading this again. And I've started seeding again. Hopefully more seeders will come and help (since I uploaded a terabyte myself last time).

Anyways, it's an adventure game. Ya, that about sums it up. :)

Based upon the Plex group's CD-release. The no-cd crack from Reloaded is included. All .nfo-files are included as well. Everything can be found on the disc (mounted or burnt).
