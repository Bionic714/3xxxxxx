,belga1,2006-07-22T03:17Z,Be aware...the help posted for find the key is not working....so it's useless (I make this error..lol) to download this file...!!!
,fabula,2006-07-22T17:27Z,It may not work for everyne but it is worth AT LEAST trying.
,Vol-com,2006-07-31T01:26Z,"For this payware add-on, each computer that it is installed on, needs a unique serial key, no key provided in any of these torrent´s will work on your computer. The only program that I know of that will ""crack"" (or provide you with the key) is OLLYDBG, but it´s kinda difficult to use, but it´s not impossible.
This is THE best add-on to FS 2004, no other aircraft comes even close the realism this Dash 8 provides...and trust me...I´m flying the Dash-8 100 and 300 series in real life:)"
,Vol-com,2006-07-31T01:40Z,"I´ve just upped a fully functional copy of the Majestic (FANDA) Dash8 Q300, including OLLYDBG, intallation-instructions, and a Wideroe livery. Enjoy
