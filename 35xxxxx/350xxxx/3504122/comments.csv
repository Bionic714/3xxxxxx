Don't waste your time. These guys should be banned from TPB."

,pyc,2006-07-18T07:55Z,"I don't understrand why it is such hard to get a password. We are giving to you, why wouldn't you give to us such little..."
,pyc,2006-07-18T08:02Z,the address where you can find password is written in filename... you dumb .... ;)
,Kenshi,2006-07-18T20:19Z,ok i looked at the http://www.electronics.vizio.biz/ but i could not find any password or do i have to sign up to your website to get it or what ?
,pyc,2006-07-18T22:56Z,"ok, i'm not that bad guy... :) password is: ""elektronikmuzik""   ... you just have to search the forum for technasia and you would easily find it..."
,gilou37,2006-07-19T03:01Z,"No. Because I tried to find it in your website. It would be faster without your password. I hope it's good music.
Thank you pyc!"
,gilou37,2006-07-19T03:20Z,"I take my ""thank you"" back. I could not open that piece of s... with Quick Time. I deleted it.
Next time, make it even more complicated."
,pyc,2006-07-19T08:15Z,quicktime is not shit that much because it fitted 20 mins of relatively good quality video in 100 MB. i tried much different codecs and this one worked out best...
,gilou37,2006-07-20T01:45Z,"hum... whatever... your torrent is unwatchable.
Piece of craps, waste of bandwith.... Can you make something readable with Window Media Player like 99.9999999999999999% of the rest?"
,pyc,2006-07-20T07:43Z,"believe me i tried... and the file was 10 times bigger.... but ok there should be better solution playable in wmp, i just need to play more... if you tell me how to do it with vegas, that would be cool, because i tried lot of things already..."
,Kenshi,2006-07-23T18:38Z,Thx pyc for the passw. btw your website is cool :)
,Kenshi,2006-07-23T18:42Z,"you can view the file with VLC player.
