,uncommonman,2007-01-03T23:16Z,"no duplicates and the quality is ok, some files better some just okay but you if you want to listen just download a few files (from book 1 or The Hedge Knight & The Sworn Sword) and see (listen) for yourself..."
,az4o,2007-01-17T18:54Z,Awesome. Thanks for this precious audio book. I don't know is there better quality but this is fair enough.
,czarofearth,2007-01-30T01:24Z,"On some of teh tracks i hear other voices faintly in the background, what is that?"
,uncommonman,2007-01-30T23:36Z,"It usualy is in audiobooks, think its just for the small size (compression)."
,Numdian,2007-04-09T19:58Z,Whats up with book 4 ??
,uncommonman,2007-04-10T16:38Z,"Numdian book 4 is in .m4b files. They work in iTunes, i have tryed to change format on them but I dont know how. (any one out there that can do it please tell me how)

iTunes can be downloaded free from: http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/ 

[the files are copy protected but iTunes is free; got to love apple :P]"
,Numdian,2007-04-12T18:30Z,"I used JHymn to convert it..

but the order is a bit mixe upp.."
,Kokuei,2007-08-09T00:03Z,"I did a convert of ""A Feast For Crows""with dBpoweramp. After listening to about 230 of the 314 files, i found them mixed up beond the point that i could follow the story.
"
,kenzeitak,2007-09-20T21:36Z,"I sure wish these were rent able in Swedish libraries because this quality is horrible. The books are great and many thanks to George RR Martin for a wonder of great books. 

This torrent is not worth downloading though...
Wish these were available at regular quality."
,TheOnionKnight,2007-11-07T09:19Z,"I also noticed that around file 230 of book 4 the rest of the files are scrambled.

Anyone got the correct queue from 230 to 314?"
,icogetch,2008-05-25T20:26Z,"The correct order for Book 4 - A Feast for Crows 

1, 2, 3   ...   227, 228, 229,

243, 242, 241   ...   232, 231, 230,

244, 245, 246   ...   312, 313, 314"
,icogetch,2008-05-31T21:11Z,"Ignore the previous post, the order is slightly wrong
Correct order is :

          1 - 220
243,242 - 222,221
      244 - 314"
,ktc,2008-10-27T11:30Z,"I used 'S.U.P.E.R.' to convert the m4bs to mp3s and
then used 'mp3tag' to batch tag the files into correct order and rename the files...both are freeware programs"
,Decyfer,2009-03-16T05:46Z,Does Roy Ditrice read all of these books????
,Callandor84,2010-04-24T23:25Z,"This torrent isn't of best quality but I recommend it simply because you dont cry about what is available. I do recommend a seperate torrent for book 4:A Feast For Crows due to the difficulty of correcting this one, tho. Also, it only took 13 mins to download this one due to an irregular amount of seeds, so get it while its hot!"
,ruthchiun,2011-01-29T03:43Z,"I just uploaded a file of MP3s of book 3 because I wanted a better quality.  Feel free to check it out and see if the quality is what is desired.

I downloaded the MP3s directly from the Book On CD.

,fbmdeth,2011-05-16T04:36Z,"czarofearth
On some of teh tracks i hear other voices faintly in the background, what is that?

me too...anybody know?"
,Zennboy,2011-06-10T03:48Z,"When you hear voices in the background (and it's usually older audio books), that usually means it's been digitally captured from a cassette tape source.  Cassette tapes store data in separate tracks on a magnetic tape.  Over time, the tape degrades and you get some of that bleed through.  So you are actually hearing the flip side track faintly and in reverse."
,Dantheman420,2011-07-04T07:05Z,who does the voice nairation??? it isnt listed
