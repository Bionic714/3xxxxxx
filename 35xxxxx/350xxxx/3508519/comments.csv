2 Byt ut ikonen, men det visste du redan
3 Du kommer evne behöva ladda ner en .dll fil med namnet d3dx9_25 (du kommer få ett felmeddelande om dett) Du laddar enklast ner den från www.dll-files.com Winzippa den och lägg hela sk*ten i Bin-mappen där du installerade spelet.

,WorldVeil,2007-06-10T22:15Z,"1.  YES, I mounted .iso with Daemon Tools.  
2.  YES, I installed.
3.  YES, I replaced .exe in 'bin' file with the crack .exe file.
4.  YES, I downloaded the 'd3dx9_25.dll' file and pasted it into BOTH my bin file and 'C:\Windows\System'

5.  AND NO, it doesn't work!!! It starts fine, but as soon as I try to start the Campaign (or anything else, for that matter) it exits out and gives me an error message (the one where it always asks if you want to send an error report).

Anyone have ANY ideas?"

,alanst,2007-07-06T11:51Z,"To any one who already success play this file can you please confirm wheter the option ""Hero trial"" in the setting available ? Because if it is not, just waste my time to download it because same with i already got.
And here are some share my experience
1. It's better you download last version of daemon tool and active all the option
2. Wheter or not you have DirectX, just check Install DirectX from install menu
3. If you already install, update direct x and graphics card but still can not enter the game after loading,
try this, it worked on version 1.0
3.a. Copy H5game.exe from crack directory to install directory
3.b. Run your Hex edit program such as Hex32 Editor to open this file
3.c. Find this Hex code :
51 56 8b f1 8b 4e 08 2b 4e 04 8b 46 28 c1 f9
and replace with
c3 56 8b f1 8b 4e 08 2b 4e 04 8b 46 28 c1 f9
so only change the first digit from ""51"" to ""c3"".
After that you can play the game. "
,katie99,2007-07-07T19:11Z,"As for the 'game manual not found error', I don't know why anybody decided to rename the files. But if it occurs then rename the GAME_MAN pdf in the manual/english folder to Game Manual.pdf. Then you can actually write all of the files to a dvd along with a few other games, or just store it on your harddrive. The installation has no problems after that."
