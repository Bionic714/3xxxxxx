High-profile friendly at Arsenal\'s new Emirates stadium.

This is the first match to be played at the club\'s impressive new home and recognises fan favourite Dennis Bergkamp\'s career at Arsenal. Dutch masters Ajax are the visitors and, in the second half of the match, will include in their ranks legends Johan Cruyff, Marco van Basten and Marc Overmars, amongst others.

Bergkamp has been with the Gunners for 11 years having joined from Inter Milan in a ┬ú7.5m deal in 1995.
He played 423 games for Arsenal and the match brings the last of his three clubs head-to-head with his first, Ajax.
Bergkamp describes himself as \"proud and happy\" to be the focus of attention at Arsenal\'s new stadium but conceded it will be strange to walk away from the sport.
