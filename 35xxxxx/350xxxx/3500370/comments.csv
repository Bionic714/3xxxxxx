How is the economic simulation?"
,Bamimi,2006-07-03T07:19Z,"I'll give it a try, it's really cool to bypass the publisher and supplier and make a game directly to the people."
,Majestic12,2006-07-03T21:19Z,Really nice game actually.
,Senso,2006-07-04T18:52Z,"This game rocks, it has so many variables. My new favorite game of the moment.
A must for sims addicts!"
,brisey2,2006-07-18T23:46Z,"I just bought this, its a small one-man dev by the looks of it, and theres great mod support and a community around it. Well worth getting a legit copy and supporting this guy."

,Lefava,2008-01-06T16:47Z,"And how about ""Democracy 2""? Is there any torrent to it?

Another politcal-based game I've been searching for is ""The Politcal Machine"", from Ubisoft. It's on the American elections. "
