I\'ve collected various songs from various albums, both scene releases and private rips. The genres varies from gothic rock, gothic and symphonic metal to gothic dance music (darkwave). All with a touch of darkness, despair, sadeness, lost love, loneliness...well, you get the point ;) Good material for all goths or EMO kids out there anyway, or for you who just want something fitting to cry to.

So far 12 volumes exist, but since some of them disappeared when The Pirate Bay came up running on backup after the bust, I\'ve decided to re-seed the first ten again. Be sure to stay and seed and I\'ll up vol 13 soon ;) 

Featured artists among others are: 

To/Die/For 
Nightwish 
Moonspell 
Blutengel 
Lacuna Coil 
The Cr√ºxshadows 
The Gathering 
L\'ame Imortelle 
Within Temptation 
The 69 Eyes 
Tapping The Vein 
Bella Morte 
Tiamat 
Evanescence 
Theatre of Tragedy 
Epica 
Xandria 

Total: 162 tracks, 7h 53 min worth of music! 
Quality differs, most of them are 192 kbps or better though. 

Please seed at least as much as you download to keep the torrent alive, I\'ve only got 45 kbps upload. 

Also, comments are more than welcome :) 

Enjoy!
