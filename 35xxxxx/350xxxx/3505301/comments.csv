,IvanOverkill,2006-07-24T11:04Z,"I wouldn't compare this to Nuendo - not even close. Tracktion IS very easy to use, but is not intended for the types of advanced production that Nuendo is designed for. Totally different class of product."
,rasjani,2006-10-02T18:59Z,This release is missing all the plugins/examples/presets and documentation files..
,SuperSix,2007-02-11T17:52Z,This is a brilliant program! I have stopped using my Sonar 6.0 PE after i got this.
