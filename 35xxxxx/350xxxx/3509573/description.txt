This is the Chain of Command Unified Artillery v. 1.1 (Battle Kings).

Documents (user manual and all the others) are in your ofp/@CoC/Documents directory.

stuff in Addons Directory (CoC_Arty.pbo and all the others) goes into your ofp/@CoC/addons directory.

stuff in Missions Directory (ChainOfCommand Folder) goes into your ofp/Missions directory.

stuff in MPMissions Directory (ChainOfCommand Folder) goes into your ofp/MPMissions directory.

Stuff in the Editor Missions Directory goes in your ofp/users/"your username" directory

If the user is running WGL, WGL_UAMortars.pbo goes into the ofp/@WGL5/addons directory. Also, excessive FPS slowdowns can probably be fixed by adding the following lines to the init.sqs

@WGLWeaponFXInit

WGLMGTypes=[]
WGLfuncRifle={}


Please report any bugs to me or on the CoC Forums (forums.thechainofcommand.com)

some known bugs:
   A) On some very big missions, after a certain amount of time, a Crash-To-Desktop may occur on Retry, or (in MP) on reloading the Briefing screen (#Restart).
   B) In multiplayer on a dedicated server, between rounds, the firing units elevate their barrels to 90 degrees. This does not effect the firing of the rounds; it just looks weird.
   C) The missions are in various states of disarray. They _should_ work.
