,Baga,2006-07-23T20:09Z,Yeah itÂ´s a GVI file sorry i missed that-(
,XsuperXdudeX,2006-07-25T17:36Z,it also plays in vlc player--a friend said he renamed it avi to play in vlc--but it played straight up in mine---does anyone know of a program to convert this to avi--nice torrent--i also got one last week called bin ladden from here--they are on to bush--both video clips are worth getting---thanks baga for this torrent--very good!
,DataPumpHer,2006-09-10T17:55Z,"Conversion not necessary.  The natural media codec for this .GVI file -IS- DivX 4 (OpenDivX) so changing the file extension to .AVI makes perfect sense.  
To convert (recode/recompress) the .gvi file would only risk a loss of quality and possibly increase its size.  

Personally, I feel it was pretty assinine of them (Google) to affix a ""false-new"" media type extension on it when its REALLY an .AVI file!

So, for those who get an error while trying to open this file, rename the file extension to .AVI and it should play fine.  If you still can't play the file, then what you need is the DivX codec, or suitable equivalent such as X-Vid and you're good to go.
