,sputnikk666,2006-07-27T04:28Z,The copy I burned defaults to Audio:French and Subtitles:Spanish
,adolfo1122,2006-07-27T05:04Z,"sputnikk666 did you use the patch? And did you 

choose the spanish menu and therefore get 

spanish subtitles ? can u do me a favour and 

check if you choose english menu and then if you

get english subtitles and the same with the 

swedish + if its with default French audio.

Please I beg u mate."
,sputnikk666,2006-07-27T13:23Z,"Ok, sorry for beeing little unclear, I have not downloaded this patch. There is three menu options, choosing Castellano (the first option) gives French audio and spanish subtitles. Choosing Swedish menu gives French audio with swedish subtitles. Choosing English gives French audio and english subtitles. "

One last question, did u try the movie on the pc

or on a standalone dvd?  because on the pc

there was no problem for me either. but on the 

standalone there was."
