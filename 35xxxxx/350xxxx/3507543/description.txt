I found this patch, and i think it would be usefull for others to,

the patch worked for me.






This patch corrects the problem when the main movie starts with
the \"comment audio stream\" on a standalone DVD player.

If you havent yet burned the iso from the extracted rars, patch the iso with
the PPF-file, then burn.

If you already did burn the iso. Create a new iso from your burned copy,
and then patch it with the PPF-file, then burn the iso again.

To make an iso of your burned copy, you could use \"DVD Decrypter\"
which you can download for free, just google.
