This is the reason why i dont like Rips.

After "installing" its possible that you have a "maze". Shorelines, water and landclass problems. 

I use UT-EU as well (1.1 updated!!). I applied the included UT-EU patch. After restart i was shocked, it looked terrible^^ 
But i use lwmviewer2 and find out, that the file HP950160_FCBP_EX.bgl (Flight Simulator 9\Scenery\Eurw\Scenery) made problems, so i delted it. Now it looks fine. One small problem i found on the south of the island, a very small piece of land was missplaced, i think this is a flatten problem.

Use at own risk. No flames allowed. 

If you have any scenery problems, i can highly recommend lwmviewer:
jimkeir.co.uk/FlightSim/LWMViewer2.html

Its a beta, and its work not 100% well, but its enough to find out which scenery objects make trouble, you can spot and just delete or rename the files. 

In programm, (start fs9 and go to your problem area) click on center on plane (or press home key), press f7 and check or unchek the elements till you see that your missplaced will disapear. Rightklick on filename, you can open the folder and mark the file direct. Close fs9 and rename...

This is for advanced users of fs9, and whwn you shold have problems with elba or lwmviewer, you should not use it.
