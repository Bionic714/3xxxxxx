"Day_of_the_Woman"(1978)(Cult Classic)
Aka: I_Spit_On_Your_Grave

This is the film that film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert led a successful campaign to remove it from the theaters because of the content. Admittedly, it's not an easy film to watch by any stretch of the imagination, but I wouldn't consider it complete trash like they did.

Here's the plot: A beautiful female writer from New York comes to small-town USA to write her first novel. Four men kidnap her, rape her multiple times, and leave her for dead. After recovering, she bides her time and then methodically kills each of them. That's it.

The merits of this particular film have been hotly debated by horror fans since its release. It is not an easy film to like, and unless you have twisted sensibilities, there's not much fun to be had during a screening. It is not, however, as poorly made or acted as its detractors claim.

If you are a hardcore horror fan or consider yourself knowledgeable about the genre, your education is simply incomplete until you have seen it. Moviewatchers looking only for entertainment in their movies should avoid it carefully. Those who think of themselves as students of film -- well, this much controversy and bile should be reason enough to take a look.
