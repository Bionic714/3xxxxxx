Buckminster Fuller described himself as a "living verb." Holder of 48 honorary doctorate degrees, born in the 1890s, he was a philosopher and engineer whose experience and global view of humanity and science enabled him to transcend nationalism and temporary current conditions and foresee the direction of major events in the future.

He created the geodesic dome to show how much can be accomplished utilizing very little. In this program and series of interviews, he points out how mankind is moving from the tangible world which can be evidenced by sight, sound, smell and touch, into the invisible world of energy, ions, electrical forces, etc., so much so that "99.9999% of what affects our reality will be undetectable by our senses."

He states that "man must learn to think for himself, rather than follow blindly what he has been taught." "As the astronauts stated, the words ?up? and ?down? have no meaning. The correct words are ?out? and ?in?. This was confirmed when mankind learned the Earth was round, not flat." He expresses many fascinating theories in these interviews that conditions today confirm.
