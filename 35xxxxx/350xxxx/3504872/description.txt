Grey Gardens is a documentary by the Maysles brothers about two aging ladies, "Big Edie" and "Little Edie" Beale, a mother and daughter. They live reclusively in a 28-room decaying mansion in East Hampton, an affluent community on Long Island, where they were nearly evicted by the authorities for the filthy state of their household. They were saved when Big Edie's niece, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, came to clean house, which also brought a great deal of publicity. Jackie O. had gone by the time the documentarians arrived, allowing the raccoons to resume their infestation. The movie records the life of the Beales as they reminisce, explain, sing and squabble, dance, eat pâté and pints of ice cream.

(Easter Egg: Listen after the end credits for a telephone conversation between the surviving Maysles brother and Little Edie, near the end of her life in the early 2000s.)

A dramatic movie, also called Grey Gardens, is now being made with Drew Barrymore as Little Edie Beale.
