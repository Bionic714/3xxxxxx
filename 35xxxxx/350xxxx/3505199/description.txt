This is DS9 S3D1, petsel's release.
The torrent I suspected was DS9 S3D1 turned out not to be it. I have therefore created this new torrent. People who have petsel's S3D1 release ought to be able to just point this torrent at their DVD and seed (if they feel so inclined).
I will be seeding this till there are some seeds.
If anyone has S2D5, alfredjuh's encoding:

I ask them to please seed the last 10%. There are 20 people stuck on that one.
