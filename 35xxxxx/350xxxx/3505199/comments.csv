,Mr_Fear,2006-07-20T07:42Z,"and now i remember why i was so much against people uploading iso's and not just the VIDEO_TS folder. So easy to start reseeding at a later time, cause you just copy over the dvd.
I do not and have no entention of keeping iso files stored on hdd's, just to be able to ressed at a later time (burning the dvd's, deleting the iso's and that's it) 
Sorry but i do not have the space for saving all of these iso's :("
,Skalmanhusen,2006-07-21T14:47Z,so why dont you just mount the ISO and then just copy the VIDEO_TS folder to your harddrive?
,peteralf,2006-07-22T17:13Z,"The problem with ISOs is that when you burn them to a DVD they are made into the VIDEO_TS format. If you then delete the ISO and at a later date want to seed it again, the resulting ISO will probably not be a bit-for-bit duplicate, since different ISO creation programs and settings result in different ISOs. With VIDEO_TS you can just point your torrent client at the folder and start seeding."
