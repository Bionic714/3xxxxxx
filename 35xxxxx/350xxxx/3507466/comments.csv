Forgot to write that in there....sorry."
,Bamsefar2,2006-07-26T22:52Z,"Releasedate yr 2006? This is the old movie...""The Curse of the Black Pearl""
 is the first one..."
,-ElGordo-,2006-07-27T02:34Z,"Hmmm..   How very observeing of you Bamsefar2, but it diden't say anywhere i the instructions, on how to upload stuff, that I coulden't share this movie. Even though it is from the year 2003, and it is the first of the tow released movies, it's still a damn good one :-)
If anyone else has felt lead on by this late release, to think that this is the new one (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest) you have my apologies. Check it out anyway it's a good quality."
,-ElGordo-,2006-07-27T02:47Z,"The relase date is of course a typo, this one was released 04. Februar 2004 on dvd. Sorry again."

,wessa,2006-08-21T17:39Z,"Now it works !
i had to unpack the iso file and burn the dvd files separate"
,ehagglun,2006-09-08T20:23Z,"Jocke71433,

If you'd bother reading the description box it says Swdish Subpicture.
Now, I don't know, but that sounds like it should have swedish subs.

Futhermore, I don't understand the reason for your post?
You say ""No Swe subs?"", what does that mean? Is it a pre download question, or have you downloaded it but can't find the swedish sub?

I hate fucking abstract posts... And if you don't know how to use an .iso file, if you don't know what the fuck .rar and .zip is, well then maybe you should invest in a little book called "" BASIC FUCKING COMPUTER KNOWLEDGE FOR DUMBASSES""....

If you, after reading that book (or any book similar to it), still can't get it right, then maybe this is not for you? Maybe you should collect miniature railroad tracks or stamps instead.
Amazing that you managed to actually start your computer and download a torrent... "
[V],satmah,2006-09-11T18:33Z,"Hi, I have burned this iso file and when I start a dvd program to watch the movie, I get the window says the files in the dvd disc is not a video file. I have burned this file to times, first using Nero BurningRom and then using Alcohol 120%. When I burned this iso file I dint get any error message. But When I want to play this on computer using Nero ShowTime and WinDVD I do get error message. I dont know what I can do. It is not the first time I burn a dvd. I have done this many times so I am not new. Someone could give me good ideas? Thanks a lot. "

use Daemom tools (it is freeware)
mount the iso file to a virtual dvd station
and make a 1 to 1 copy!
thats all..."
,walsie,2006-09-15T13:54Z,mount this image in DAEMON TOOLS or POWER ISO what ever... then use NERO to burn a DVD-VIDEO and put all the files from the mounted file to VIDEO_TS directory... then it should work...
[V],Hanz,2006-09-16T01:10Z,thanx mate!
,LayZAss2I,2006-09-18T22:36Z,I've downloaded the file already and tried to burn with Toast with no luck.  Anyone get this to work on a Mac?  Daemon and Power are for Windows only...Thanks.  
,hayguys1,2006-09-28T01:34Z,"ya, Im new to this
How can I make this ISO-file work?

,Belegost,2006-11-22T20:31Z,Use alcohol 120% to burn dvds and mount programmes/games!! it workes great!
,Burlak,2006-12-16T04:15Z,"The file in Video_TS: vts_01_5.vob is not real. It is, in stead of the ending scenes, the starting scenes over again. Leaving me with no ending. Anyone exp the same? the file also is 386mb instead of 1.07gb like the other parts.
Winrar made an odd message when I extracted the iso. 
can that be the reason?"
,perand8,2007-05-19T07:10Z,Same error as Burlak. Guess what you get instead of buying.
,Jalle64,2007-06-01T12:55Z,"Theres no subtitles in this rip, so dont trust what it says :(("
