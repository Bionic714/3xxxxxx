,shoggoth,2006-07-12T23:19Z,Seriously.. What kind of connection do you Spaniards have? More then a day and only half the movie.
,shoggoth,2006-07-12T23:20Z,"And please, if your line is slow, create a .rar archive and use super seeding."
,shoggoth,2006-07-15T00:06Z,There are no subtitles. How hard can it be to give correct info?!
,Goethemola!,2006-07-20T12:46Z,"Yes... Sorry for the subtitles. But the cover information of the DVD was wrong. I modified the upload in the other trackers, but here in Pirate Bay I don't know how to do it without deleting th file.

And about my connection speed... Well, I had some problems with my company. Usually I upload a whole movie in 72 hours, but...

And finally, sorry sorry sorry for the subtitles. As you can see, I try to put all the info (including menus) but, as I said, the DVD info was wrong.   "
