Yuen Woo Ping, now internationally famous for his action choreography in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Matrix, has directed many impressive kung-fu films since the late 1970s. In 1993 he collaborated with popular action star Donnie Yen in Iron Monkey . Donnie Yen, whose fame also recognized worldwide by now, serves as the action choreographer as well as the male lead.

In Iron Monkey, a representative Hong Kong action movie in the 1990s, Yuen Woo Ping and Donnie Yen strike a harmonious balance between traditional real Kung-fu and wired actions to make it a title well-received locally and abroad. Donnie Yen stars as the father of the legendary Wong Fei Hung and gets engaged in splendid fights with the Robin-hood like figure played by another action star Yu Rongguang.
