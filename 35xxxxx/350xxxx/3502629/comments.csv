,eclecticus,2006-08-18T19:50Z,"This is an amazing rare find. Glad to see it, and to see that others are interested as well. But please, keep seeding this rarity after downloading; I'm uploading with a ratio of already more than 4,5 and I see a lot that people disappear after finishing download.
Keep this one alive!"

Thank's, always, freakyflicks team.

,zeinabqureshi,2008-04-16T23:18Z,"Yes, this is a rare one.
@Shenmue_GdA: Well, would like to *know* my Paradjanov. I think it's a bit too much to ask, because I make less sense all the time. Tarovsky, Antonioni, Pasolini and the rest...they all seem to connect at some place or the other, but this man...he's an enigma. I guess that's his beauty."
