Apparently this anthology was meant to work an occult ritual designed to spark off the counterculture hippie movement, as a supernatural spell."

,kaypher,2009-08-19T19:10Z,"This was given to me when I left a record shop I worked in. We used to say that a record shop that didn't have this in stock wasn't a record shop. I love it, and it's deep in storage right now. Thank you for the upload."
,nyquilcoma,2010-09-22T15:03Z,"This is the single most important set of recordings in the history of American music, even with huge kudos and apologies to the Lomax's. First found these as a kid in the '70's at the local library and have been listening ever since. These records can change your life."
