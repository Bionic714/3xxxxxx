,swec89,2006-07-04T11:09Z,fy fan vad dålig tokeyo drift är..
,mrdeeds,2006-07-04T17:09Z,top class film beats the other two fast and furious films
,syn77,2006-07-04T17:41Z,thx movie maVen version and offical sound track full album in 1 torrent
,syn77,2006-07-04T17:42Z,will seed until 2007 
,BlackDahlia,2006-07-05T08:03Z,"Shit snubben om du nu lägger upp nåt så kan det vara bra o dela ut skiten också! 

Which roughly translates on Langenberg to: Shit stumbling if yous now am laying up present so able the be up to scratch un expedite dirt also!"
,BlackDahlia,2006-07-05T08:06Z,I would like to know where they get all of these rear-wheel-drive rice burners in this movie. All of the drifting stunts cannot be done with a front-wheel-drive car -- like that part about going around that spiral drive ramp -- because the FWD would simply drag you into the wall. If these things are RWD then they are highly modified from the FWD models they started laife as.
,BlackDahlia,2006-07-05T08:35Z,Syn77: How about seeding it until tomorrow morning? Eight peers stuck at 45.8% ... and waiting.
,max11max,2006-07-05T17:46Z,"WOT no seeders - Stuck @ 45.8%, Seed this torrent."
,BlackDahlia,2006-07-05T21:02Z,Ninety -- COUNT 'EM -- NINETY peers waiting for someone to get off their dead a$$ and seed this thing. 
,BlackDahlia,2006-07-06T05:39Z,We are up to 111 peers waiting for a seed to finally show up.
,BlackDahlia,2006-07-06T05:51Z,I guess syn77 meant he would seed the file until 20:07 or 8:07PM
,Toxic_tbg,2006-07-07T00:25Z,"BlackDahlia


You answeared your question yourself, they are modified to do drifting.. =)"
,BlackDahlia,2006-07-07T03:05Z,Toxic: That would require beaucoup bucks including frame modification -- ie adding a frame to the existing unibody -- etc. Only then do you start with the rest of the mechanical and aesthetic mods One of those things is NOT a cheap date fer sure.
,BlackDahlia,2006-07-07T03:10Z,Still showing 0 seeds even though TPB shows 1. There must be something out there as everyone I am monitoring -- 100+ peers -- has a maximum of 76.7% while I have 80.1% with a share rating of 4.181. Yet Bittornado only shows .770 distributed copies out in the ether.

All the cars in the movie are RWD except fpr the EVO which has been converted from AWD to run full time RWD so they've taken out the front diff and driveshafts."

,BlackDahlia,2006-07-08T18:37Z,I'm at 99.8% -- how I did that I'll never know -- with 120 peers sucking my tit but I'm getting nothing  on the download side. Bittornado says they have an average of 96.3% with a distributed copy of 98.5%. If the distributed copy never reaches 1.000 then none of us will ever have the full movie.
,BlackDahlia,2006-07-08T18:40Z,"By the by, I ran the movie and the quality is excelent. It runs right up to the last few minutes and cuts off so the part I'm missing is the last 59.08MB. I have 697.00MB out of the 756.08MB."

,devyl66,2006-07-10T14:28Z,"Somebody Please seed!We are stucked in 99,2%!"
,BlackDahlia,2006-07-11T09:47Z,"syn77, Go to http://www.majorgeeks.com and join the forum. See if anyone there has any info on the trojan."
,BlackDahlia,2006-07-11T10:16Z,"Now here's some Twilight Zone s--- for ya. The file SAYS it is 1:24:05 long. WMP and WinAMP both play the file up to the point where they duck under the garage door prior to finding the engine for the Mustang at 1:24:05 and then they stop. VLC Media Player, however, ALSO says the file is 1:24:05 but continues playing past that point to the end of the movie where the ""Don't try this at home"" warning displays. So I guess the trick is to use VLC if you want to see the entire flick."
,BlackDahlia,2006-07-11T10:20Z,"syn77, Try this. http://members.lycos.co.uk/dns2php/"
,BlackDahlia,2006-07-11T10:26Z,P.S. I found the cure for your virus in a couple of minutes using Copernic Agent Search Engine available from http://www.copernic.com . It is freeware and lightyears better than Google.
,Roon85,2006-07-11T18:28Z,seed!! stuck @ 99.2%
,BlackDahlia,2006-07-12T05:17Z,"Roon, 99.2 is sufficient to see the entire flick -- just don't try it with WMP or WinAMP. Go to http://www.videolan.org and download VLC Media Player. It's freeware."
,rambojambo,2006-07-12T10:59Z,"come on! seed FFS, 41 ppl are stuck at 99.2 %...."
