,chodachoda,2007-04-15T23:06Z,"This torrent is useless.
Most of the useful Windows versions 98, XP etc. require you to make a floppy.
I don't have a fucking floppy drive tard, they're totally obsolete. If they were the floppy images that would have been useful."
,maan1234,2007-04-16T15:57Z,"chodachoda, windows 98 and XP can be booted from CD. No floppy is needed for installing them"

!) YOU are a Tard.
2) Floppy drives are absolutely NOT obsolete.
3) ALL kinds of expensive programs REQUIIRE a license to be read FROM A FLOPPY DISK - And said disks cannot be copied to n IMA or VFD file:

Ergo, I see chodachoda, whos real name is vaginavagina, running LIKE MAD to buy a fuckin USB floppy drive when he tries to install a program, say like Mitchell Manager and the program orders you to PUT THE LICENCE FLOPPY into the A drive.

What a fucking TARD- Your fuckin hair is glued onto yer head with cunny juice from yo mama.

Get the FUCK outta here, SHILL"
