,rbaleksandar,2007-07-19T11:10Z,Ave Verum Corpus is one of the greatest classical hits ever. Wolfgang Mozart Rulzzzzz;-)
,Maoxx,2008-08-11T01:45Z,"Nah, Mozart is ok, even though he's the official gay posterboy of classical music. I never could stand him until I heard Reqiuem, which could possibly contend as the greatest musical piece ever written. Kind of. At least the part that he wrote himself."
