Johann Sebastian Bach, Ave Maria - Sacred Arias and Choruses
is a collection of some of the most famous pieces of classical
music around and is a great collection for people who like to
listen to the occasional piece of art music but who don't have
a hugely knowledgeable background in classical music.
You can work your way from a compilation like this into other
choral works by the composers you like, and into symphonies, etc.
The songs herein are not always showcased at their best,
but they are some of the most evocative and beautiful choral
pieces ever written and everybody should know them from more
than their use in things like commercials and TV shows as
background music.
