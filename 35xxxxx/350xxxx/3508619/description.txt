mIRC is a shareware IRC Chat client for Windows. It is developed 
and copyrighted by Khaled Mardam-Bey. For those of you new to the 
Internet, IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat. The IRC network is a 
virtual meeting place where people from all over the world can meet 
and talk (well, type). On IRC you meet others on \"channels\" (rooms, 
virtual places, usually with a certain topic of conversation) to 
talk in groups, or privately. There is no restriction to the number 
of people that can participate in a given discussion, or the number 
of channels that can be formed on IRC. As a user you run a \"client\" 
program like mIRC which connects to a \"server\" in an IRC network. 
All servers are interconnected and pass messages from user to user 
over the IRC network. One server can be connected to several other 
servers and up to hundreds of clients. If you need more information 
on IRC go to mIRC\'s www Homepages where a lot of additional 
information is given.
