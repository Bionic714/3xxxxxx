,ChiLLaZ,2006-08-10T14:09Z,"Info, Chappelles Show didnt get a 3rd season since Dave Chappelle refused a 50 Million Dollar contract and flew to Africa so this season is just a few unaired sketches put together..."

,DeXtC,2006-08-24T14:51Z,"Chillaz: I'm pretty sure that he wasn't in Africa, that was just rumors.
He was on Oprah and explained it all, but I don't remember all of it because of the state I was in."
,chappelles,2006-12-06T05:40Z,"He bailed in the middle of production of the third season. They've put together sketches and made 3 shows out of it, having Charlie Murphy and Donnell Rawlings as hosts. And yes, Dave took a break from it all and went to South Africa.
He also said that he didnt want the unfinished third season to be aired, which Comedy Central did anyway, even releasing a DVD with the Lost Episodes."
