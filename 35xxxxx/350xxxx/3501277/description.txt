This is a perfect, uncompressed rip of the group\'s first CD, purchased within weeks of its original release in 1992. I believe this disc can be somewhat hard to find these days and I haven\'t seen it posted around the torrent sights, so I figured I\'d put it out there and see what happens.

NOTE: This distribution consists of full resolution CD-DA WAVE files, compressed using the FLAC lossless compression codec. In most cases it will be necessary to uncompress these files back into normal WAVEs before playback. A plugin for WinAmp also exists which will allow you to play FLAC files directly in WinAmp without uncompressing them first.
