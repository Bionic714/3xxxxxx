,radgegadgee,2006-07-23T01:34Z,"Hmm... I wonder what a typical feminist reaction to a book entitled ""The Proper Care and Feeding of Wives"" would be?"
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2006-09-02T17:03Z,Please seed.
,patrick80639,2008-04-01T00:54Z,"Awesome, thanks! Am going to put this on my wife's iPod. About time she straightened up her act. Can't remember the last time she ironed any of my clothes."

[V],cezen,2008-12-19T23:23Z,"I actually really like this book... not going to say that I agree wiith everything, but as a strong and independant woman.... i will say that I am willing to jump through hoops to help make my husband feel valuable and needed.... when he feels valued I am treated like a QUEEN/Princess etc....it is WELL worth the effort... and if nothing else I have used this as a manual to get through a ROUGH spot to help shape my reactions so we don't argue while keeping myself from being a doormat....

thank you DR> Laura

,turdcrow,2011-04-02T23:28Z,"My share ratio is almost 16, and there is still no significant new seeding going on. People! What is with the hit and run?!"
