This is S2D2 of petsel's release.
There is currently one seeder and a few leechers.

If you want this, now's as good a time as ever.

Of the DVDs I have inspected so far, the following of petsel's releases would benefit from a seed:
DS9 S1D1  
http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3320585
DS9 S1D5  
http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3312900

All the rest of the S1 torrents are managing well so far.

Remember, I will seed all of these torrents in time, so the whole series will be available sometime. But the more help I get, the faster this will be.

WANTED!
I still need the .torrent file for petsel's release of DS9 S4D5. PM me if you have it.
