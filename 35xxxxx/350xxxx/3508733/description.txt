Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band 
Strictly Personal 
1968 (release) 

AMG EXPERT REVIEW: Producer Bob Krasnow infuriated the artist by
remixing the album while he was on tour. While we don't know how the
Captain intended us to hear it, the music retains his raw, weird
power. Even without Ry Cooder, who left after the impressive Safe as
Milk from a year before, this release contains several powerhouse
trance-blues numbers from one of music's true originals. ? Mark Allan
