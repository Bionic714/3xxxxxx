,ebichu63,2006-07-23T21:12Z,"I have an MPEG2 version too if there's any demand for it. But this is 984 MB and contains the glitch at 06:40 mentioned earlier, which will appear as an actual error in the MPEG bitstream in this case."
,k-t-m,2006-07-23T22:17Z,"I'd recommend trying mencoder, or AviSynth-ing it through to TMPGEnc, if you wanna make a DVD. Of course the original MPEG2 stream would have even better quality..."
,Lanfear,2006-07-24T17:31Z,"Thanks k-t-m, but those programs look far too advanced for a newbie like me.

I think I'll just stay clear of mp4 files until a good and easy to use converter is available. Maybe Tmpgenc 4.0 XPress? I'll keep my eyes open for a crack  :-)"
