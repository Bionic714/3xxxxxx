Goldfrapp live at "T in the Park" 2006-07-08. Includes performances of "Fly Me Away", "Train", "Number 1", "Satin Chic", "Ooh La La", and "Strict Machine".

Captured from a BBCi DVB-T channel and converted to MP4 stream, H.264/AVC video, and AAC audio.  Includes chapter stops for each song.

Length: 28m 39s.
Frame: 720x576, 25 fps, PAL 16:9.

Note, there is a minor video glitch at 06:40 from my original capture, during "Train", but the camera is panning over the audience at the time so it doesn't spoil it too much.  There are no audio glitches apart from a couple of on-stage instrument failures. ;-)

Enjoy!
