,tripcat,2006-07-22T19:44Z,`In order to play you still need to get a crap load of updates still.But I agree with you  Nathcrow they realy wrecked this game I was on Bloodfin 
,Dumplo,2006-07-22T21:29Z,where do i find the other updates for this game in order to play it??
,Myah-san,2006-07-23T00:22Z,Are there any emulated servers that play this version of the game like there are emulated servers for World of Warcraft? I used to play this game fairly often till the combat upgrade destroyed the game.
,bibihest,2006-07-23T07:38Z,Your so right. They destroyed the game after that combat upgrade. Probably THE best game ever for me... untill that upgrade
,MelvinFoX,2006-07-23T14:10Z,Is it possible to play it without paying the fee?
,Kriso,2006-07-23T16:17Z,NGE fucked up swg not CU
,tys1198,2006-07-23T17:53Z,http://www.xtremetop100.com/star-wars-galaxies  Here ya go! This site has a bunch of upstarting emulator servers for this game. Most of them are just getting the SWGEMU working since it just went open source but this will help you guys get started with what is available so far.
,jeff86,2006-07-23T20:05Z,"swgemu still has a ways to go, trust me  ;] i guess it couldnt hurt to dl this now, but you wont be playing for atleast another 2 months"
,Myah-san,2006-07-24T10:44Z,"No, CU destroyed the game NGE was just take a piss on the gravesite.

Yeah I actually managed to find some sites with the SWGEmu, it looks very promising. www.swgemu.com you can check out what they do and don't have working. They seem to be progressing fairly rapidly, over the last few days they've managed to get inventories and stuff working which is great since it's only been opensource less then a month. Hopefully they'll have combat up and basic combat professions up and running then it's only a matter of populating the worlds and you can start having some fun again."
,blargisme,2006-07-24T20:03Z,"Man, I'm soo psyched that someone has taken on this project. I was on Gorath, soooo many great memories!"

,deharak,2007-06-01T01:45Z,Could someone please seed? Don't be greedy people at least start seeding when you're off your compute or sleeping. I'll seed for the weekend once I finish downloading.
,deharak,2007-06-01T01:49Z,The CU added levels which screwed up the game in most peoples opinions. Though that was a huge mistake in and of itself the addition of the NGE was a colossal mistake. If they would just suck it up and admit they made a mistake I'm sure everyone would be more at ease. Its too late for that now! SWGEmu is goin to be done soon! For more info visit www.swgemu.com

,rod_aa,2008-08-27T02:24Z,Is it actually playable even without the latest ruinous patches??
,shorelinetrance,2008-09-13T03:45Z,"no, you have to play it on an emulator, but none are released yet, although i think one is alpha public. google swgemu"

,Nerolus,2009-04-17T10:15Z,I've uploaded about 12gigs over the course of the past 6 days - helping out my fellow SWG refugees.
,Nerolus,2009-04-17T10:19Z,"Step 1: Download this torrent

Step 1)

TORRENT: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3506104/Star_Wars_Galaxies__Pre_CU_(including_Patches_00-13)

Step 2)

INSTALL: http://www.swgemu.com/forums/showthread.php?t=17564

Step 3)

Download This: http://files.filefront.com/ClientDllszip/;12687037;/fileinfo.html
Extract it into the folder with all the patches in, do not move the files out the folder. (If you have an NGE subscription just dump the folder into your NGE directory and run swgemu.exe this will not mess up your nge installation at all!)

Step 4)

Run SWGEmu_setup.exe (located in the emuclient subfolder which was from step 3 download) and make sure to set the screen size otherwise it may cause some problems.

Step 5)

Open up swgemu_login.cfg and make sure you have the correct ip
Code:

[ClientGame]
loginServerPort0=44453
loginServerAddress0=76.73.9.90

Now:
Run swgemu.exe (located in the EmuClient subfolder which was from step 3 download), should run fine if it does not I will try help as much as I can.
Errors And Fixes:

Problems with MSS32.dll (Stolen from Ekaika post below)

http://swgemu.com/support/index.php?...de=view&id=100

See footnote at the bottom. Follow link and redownload the file.


Problems Such as DirectX Failed to Initialized:
Make sure you run the EXE in the EmuClient folder.
Make sure the EmuClient Folder is in the Folder with all the patches otherwise it will fail to load the patches causing the error.
Make sure you altered the screen size and other graphics settings appropriately in swgemu_setup.exe


Problem if you used swgemu_installer.exe:

If you run swgemu.exe and get the client is out of date and you have used swgemu_installer.exe then you will have to A) find patch 14 and get it and B) download Step 3 from here and use the EmuClient Folder for its updated swgemu.exe and probably will have to use its config files so it loads upto patch 14 correctly"

,buzznjackal,2011-03-24T07:29Z,Was thinking about buying DC Universe Online until I saw SOE was behind it. Remembered my glory days of playing Star Wars Galaxies Pre CU and how SOE in their infinite wisdom tried to turn SWG into WoW with the CU. Searching around the internet I found out I wasn't the only one that left the game after CU took effect and nice to see that people are still playing this game Pre CU when the game was still fun. Long live Star Wars Galaxies Pre CU and here's hoping Bioware does Star Wars fans right.
