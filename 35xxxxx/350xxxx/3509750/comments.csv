,Mighty Bill,2007-06-05T18:07Z,"Ă&#x201E;r detta en livekonsert, eller Ă¤r det bara en massa musikvideos?"
,kacmem,2008-06-14T10:16Z,These are clips or live?
,badlands,2009-01-03T09:27Z,"Judging from the songs, this is probably the liveshow from what later became the triplealbum Tripping the live fantastic - the tour after Flowers in the dirt. There was a movie made during this tour, which is pretty rare. I say, go for it!"
,silkthinker,2009-09-01T11:16Z,anyone has this on dvd9 NTSC and DTS? please? 
,bass_man,2010-12-10T00:39Z,This is live. I used to have this on VHS years ago. I love this show.
