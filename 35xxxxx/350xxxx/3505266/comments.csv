,Crusader66,2006-07-20T15:15Z,If anyone is wondering this IS the full Planetary PackCD. It&s just not an ISO. Burn it onto a CD as is or install it from the folder. Crack is in the (You guessed it) Crack folder.
[T],Knaster,2006-07-20T20:03Z,where is the crack??
[T],Knaster,2006-07-20T20:03Z,lmao
,Soondead,2006-07-20T22:12Z,Seeding seems pretty sporadic on this one... any hope of improvement? :-)
,Crusader66,2006-07-21T04:22Z,"Sorry, my upload is a little slow at the moment.  I will seed until everybody has it though. 24/7. Probably get faster after I finnish these D/Ls."
,gnarlymatt83,2006-12-19T18:09Z,"I'm brand new to this.  I can't figure out how to make this program run.  When I go into the Crack folder, and click on either the terran icon or the terranx icon, nothing happens.  My screen goes black for a half second as though its trying to run, and then it just returns to windows.  Any suggestions?"
,gnarlymatt83,2006-12-19T18:14Z,Do I have to burn this to a cd first?  Curse my fucking idiocy!
,Gangwe,2007-04-26T07:49Z,Could you just please re-rip it and place it in .iso format? Thanks.
,broken_twig,2007-10-31T04:01Z,seed plz
,BikerTrash2003,2007-12-14T16:51Z,Seed Please!
,viva6581,2008-07-20T17:29Z,"When I try to run the cracked game I get an error saying that my CPU is not supported, and then the game crashes. Any idea how to fix this? :/"
,Nemezis2001,2008-08-27T00:52Z,"Look in the file Alpha Centauri.Ini and find such text:
[PREFERENCES]
ForceOldVoxelAlgorithm=0
change it to:
[PREFERENCES]
ForceOldVoxelAlgorithm=1

You will still get a message, that your CPU is not supported, but after clicking OK the game will run. Enjoy :)"
,Nemezis2001,2008-08-27T10:59Z,Can somebody seed this game please?
