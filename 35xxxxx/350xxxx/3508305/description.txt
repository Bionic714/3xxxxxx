The Daily Show (currently The Daily Show with Jon Stewart) is a half-hour satirical news program produced by and run on the Comedy Central cable television network in the United States. The Daily Show reports on the foibles and hypocrisy of the real world with a satirical edge. The show has also developed a reputation as one of the sharpest political commentary shows on American TV.

This disclaimer appears before the global edition aired on some networks: "The show you are about to watch is a news parody. Its stories are not fact checked. Its reporters are not journalists. And its opinions are not fully thought through."

Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell featured on The Daily Show from the late 90s to 2005 and among their funniest collaborations was "Even Stevphen" where they brilliantly and hilariously satirise the all too common debate shows/segments on cable TV, which have a tendency to polarise their viewers. A classic daily show favourite.
