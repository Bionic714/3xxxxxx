Rage Against The Machine

Rage Against The Machine, also known as RATM, was an American rock band noted both for their diligent political conscience and for their pioneering blend of hard rock and rap - as well as their vocal radical leftist beliefs. At the point of their break-up in 2000, Rage Against the Machine had become one of the most popular political hard rock bands of all time, and certainly of the 1990s. Currently, three members of the band ? Tom Morello, Tim Commerford, and Brad Wilk ? are members of Audioslave, featuring former Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell.

Rage drew inspiration from early metallic instrumentation, as well as rap acts such as Public Enemy, Cypress Hill and Afrika Bambaataa. The coalescence of rhyming styles and vocals along with their sound, especially Tom Morello's guitar techniques, makes RATM difficult to confine to any one particular musical genre.
