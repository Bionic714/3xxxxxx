As far as i can tell this is a poor AVI rip for that reason. It is somewhat annoying to watch when the images don't match the sound.

Anyone else having this problem? Anyone NOT having this problem?"
,kiwi33,2006-10-09T02:09Z,"Further to my last comment...
It seems I can play it fine using VLC Player. So, I retract my comment that the audio/video is not in sync. This file appears to be just fine."

,Judas4ever,2007-03-11T00:24Z,This movie has one agenda to spread a crap dumbass message . Dont dl its really a big waste of time!
,kiwi33,2007-04-02T12:51Z,"Well, I've watched this movie a few times now. It's interesting, and it's certainly taken the interest of many people. I must say I think it was rather lacking in substance... but I can see why, and I think that's okay. This movie is an introduction to a basic Principle at work in this universe. I might add it is, in my opinion, a rather materialistic take on that Principle, but hey... that's what most people relate to so that's what will make this movie as popular as it is. For those that want to hear the full story... to go beyond the limitations inherent in TheSecret... check out my eBook at http://www.livingthesecret.tv"

,lee321987,2009-09-19T03:40Z,"I agree - this is hard to find through ThePirateBays' search.  I did a special Google search, and this page was the fourth link.  Here's how to search a specific web site (often more useful and faster than using the sites' search):
""the secret"" site:thepiratebay.org
that line is how I found this page.  I don't know if Yahoo, or any other search engine can do this."
