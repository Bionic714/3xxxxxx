,Maxpower1985,2006-07-21T01:45Z,"Hello dgh01289

In this case I would like suggest you ""eMule"" On this Net you will find many older files like CS 757 or something else. for brand new Flight-Sim files are torrent faster, but eMule for older better ;)

Just curious.  There are a few in there I've been really wanting to get. The FranceVFR stuff is outstanding."

[T],stevekasian,2006-07-21T16:00Z,"With regard to the 757 - All that's needed is for someone to seed the damn torrent for 5 minutes and complete everyone's DL. I don't understand what the problem is. If you're gonna upload a torrent, seed the damn thing or don't upload the torrent in the first place!   ... IMHO, that is.
