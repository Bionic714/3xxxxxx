,fsgenesis,2006-07-30T19:20Z,"Yes, thank you Jungleman, for taking food out of my kids' mouths.  You guys disgust me--no shame for your dishonesty, your thievery, your stealing of someone's hard work.  for cryin' out loud, the stuff isn't expensive.  Anyone ever heard of integrity, character, honesty?  Better watch your back, guys, your bad karma will get you eventually.  Inevitably."
