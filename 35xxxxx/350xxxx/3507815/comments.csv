,hamstray,2006-07-28T00:45Z,Some of you guys were asking for this one...
,hamstray,2006-07-28T03:15Z,"BTW, sorry for the rocky start, BitComet SUCKS...I switched to uTorrent and it's amazing, highly recommend it"
,Bamimi,2006-07-28T03:31Z,"ya it is rather nice isn't it? no mem leaks like azureus, everything all on one screen. I have to say I like it as well."
,chi3sa,2006-08-02T16:44Z,"how do i get the effects package with it?
when i install it i get pro but no FX addons like Cycore CC sphere or anything.

there should be a file to install this."
,nutmilk,2006-08-17T05:04Z,Great. Crashes whenever I try to import ANYTHING. Good work assholes. 
,greenstaraz,2006-08-21T06:27Z,"I downloaded and will install soon.
MAGNiTUDE premiere pro works Great
This should also
."
,odj_310388,2006-08-24T03:18Z,"This is NOT the PRO version, it does not have the PRO features."
,byronlboy,2006-08-24T05:08Z,"I tried to install, but the install quits right during the intial Adobe Bridge install with the runtime error ""This application has requested the program terminate in an unusual way.""

Any idea of what's wrong?"
,fanoxo,2006-08-25T15:08Z,doesent work
,Neozoby,2006-08-27T20:10Z,"This one works for me flawlessly, no error. keygen is a Pro version 1063 serial. tnx for the upload."
,mr.throk,2006-09-07T15:07Z,"I downloaded and unrared
Then i unrared the only .rar file and it contained a .iso
I burned that to a dvd and when i tried to run setup.exe it failed after it asked me my language.
It gave a C++ Runtime error. 

I tried it on 2 different computers. One of which is brandnew.... Anyone have this problem? Did i try to install it incorrectly?"
,al-ski,2006-09-09T22:54Z,"Problems installing your downloads?
DOWNLOAD WINACE Archiver. This will unpack anything, iso's, rar's etc works a treat then just burn the files to cd/dvd. A doddle!"
,sailings,2006-09-20T09:56Z,"Downloaded, unzipped it, runtime error, unexpected program shut down.  All this after 4 hours of downloading.  What a waste of time - total junk!"
,p0t,2006-09-23T20:49Z,Get Daemon tools you noobs.
,thewidget,2006-09-24T23:24Z,gotta get some seeds man.
,goss4444,2006-09-28T22:47Z,"It works.  :)  

Extract the files from the ISO to the HD."
,walden1974,2006-10-17T16:45Z,"Anyone else having a problem getting the KEYGEN to work correctly?  I run the program and all I'm able to is generate serial number code, but then I don't get a response code to use.  Anyone else have any success?  Thanks"
,kilmer,2006-10-26T17:36Z,"I downloaded this, installed properly. (from both DAEMON, and from HD).  Problems:

1) When entering the serial, there is no 'ask code by phone' as suggested by the crack. I just put in the serial and it goes to install.  hmm....

2) When i try to start program, i get an error msg: 
""After effects could not start because a missing component could not be found. May be cuz bad install or unsuported OS. Check minimum sys req's or reinstall AE. (-1073741795)""

Now, the minimum sys req's ARE written as 'P4', and im trying to install on an AMD 1.2 ghz.  I doubt this is the problem tho. I have a feeling it has to do with it not asking if i want to register by phone. I think the first time i installed it sent some code over the net possibly to adobe. who knows.
Any ideas?"
,P3PP3,2006-11-06T11:49Z,"I got a problem with this as well, I registered n all but whenever I try to start after effects it just shuts down after the loading-screen.. anyone who knows what's wrong?"
,tommyboy123x,2006-11-13T09:14Z,"This works best if you extract the ISO instead of mounting it.

TO THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE HAVING A RUNTIME ERROR:

the problem is, your .net framework is out of date, and you need the ms update.  Sorry to those of you who pirate windows, but after installing this update along with .net 2.0, it worked.  The Technical name of this update is the ""Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Hotfix KB886903.

Go buy windows and stop file sharing"
,tommyboy123x,2006-11-13T09:15Z,"Also if you want to register over the phone, click ""other activation options"" on the first menu that pops up... not sure if any of you still haven't noticed this"
,moovment,2006-11-14T16:06Z,"Noobs like ""sailings"" make me sick. "
,michien,2006-12-07T09:13Z,Great torrent....works a treat installed with 0 problems.  
,stukaville,2007-01-19T22:12Z,"THIS WORKS BRILLAINT, KEYGEN WORKS BRILLANT. all those who say it doesn't are either noobs or working for Adobe, thx for a great upload hamstray!"
,horusrogue,2007-02-02T13:15Z,"I support adobe for non commercial ends - I do not support this sabotage of self enjoyment however.
Am downloading and will repost comment as to wther it works on a 1.5 athlon/winxpsp1"
,illbill,2007-02-07T13:42Z,"Fuck, problems with one of the RAR files. Corrupted or whatnot. Can this be fixed?

Thx anyway."

,gedocampos,2007-02-21T18:24Z,"I have already updated windows with .net 2.0, but the runtime error still appears when I try to install the program:

""Microsof Visual C++ Runtime Library

Runtime Error!

Program: D:\Setup.exe

This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way. Please contact the applicationÂ´s support team for more information."""
,pitchbend,2007-02-25T14:25Z,"Does anyone have any info on the missing plug-ins.  Seems like most tutorials I start I can't finish because they are calling upon some plug-in that was not included.  I look in the plug-ins folder to see if the ""Adobe After Effect Plug-in"" file is there, but it is not.  Does anyone have these files?  They are pretty small files, I just can't find them."
,LoganATK,2007-03-20T19:57Z,"gedocampos i had the same problem
FIX= dont mount the iso just extract it to your desk top (or ware ever) then install it.
 it dosent work if you try to burn it to a disk or mount it.
(this is how i got it to work)
 i did have a problem with it  wanting me to re register it after about 14 days after i used the keygen when i installed it and have to reinstall windows to get it to reinstall. hope it dont give me any more crap. Other then that it seems to be a realy good find. 
Thanks hamstray."
,replay64,2007-05-02T18:41Z,Works fantastic!! Big thanks!!!!
,GO2HELL28,2007-08-01T05:08Z,Is anyone else having problems with Adobe Bridge? Not sure if having Photoshop CS2 would have anything to do with it.....

,mytixxx,2007-08-10T12:06Z,"I need help with the Cd-keygen . I dont know how to use it, and i admit i'm a noob. Thanks!"

,somebody90,2007-12-21T06:32Z,seeD plZ!!  -.-
,nemotherotten,2008-01-22T02:19Z,"Ok...so I had the RUNTIME ERROR DURING INSTALLATION ALSO...so i did what you said...I installed MICROSOFT .NET FRAMEWORK 3.5...and it still gives me that stupid runtime error.  

I got the crack+download all set, and burnt onto a DVD...i just can get the sucker to install.  Please help me out."
,ChowDog,2008-01-27T20:09Z,OK. This did work. As mentioned you have to extract the ISO on to your hard drive somewhere in order for it to install. I got it to work just fine that way and so far no probs.
,tranceallnight,2008-02-26T09:48Z,"Works perfect, thanks!  Got the Runtime Error at first also, but after copying to a folder installed fine."
,qikink,2008-03-01T02:17Z,"I know this really isn't ideal, but for you guys who are having trouble running this because when you start it up it tells you that it had trouble starting the 'scripting' plug-in, just go to where you installed it, then into the folder that is something like plug-ins\Standard\Keyframe and just take scripting out. (Put the file in mydocs or w/e)

,Imanu16,2008-06-29T17:02Z,"some1 seed please, as I would for you..."
,camydoger,2008-07-08T14:20Z,"To get the CC Effects, search for 31 latest after effects plugins and download the one that ISN'T compressed as a rar. Don't choose to download anything except the Cycore Effects, all the rest are full of viruses. I was tempted by the trapcode keygens; the virus within slaughtered my files."
