,GraphMaN,2006-07-23T21:48Z,What version ?
,a_dummy,2006-08-11T05:55Z,This is version 4.03
,pecsi,2006-08-11T10:19Z,"Hi,

This is all pretty new to me. How do I install this, because everytime I double click it, then easy cd creator opens? And why is it called MPT322 when it is v.4?
THXS pecsi"
,robertovis,2006-09-04T16:44Z,"easy cd creator opens because it is an ISO image, to install it, first burn the iso into a cd when ease cd creator opens, once the cd is done, install it from the cd"
,fuahi,2006-09-20T23:41Z,"If you have a Motorola cell phone, this is for you.  Excellent"
,RynkSmurf,2006-10-20T23:18Z,Thank you! Any serial no in need? 
,adam k,2007-02-04T20:39Z,nie moge sciagnac tego programu nie mam dostepu
,Jason Greystone,2007-03-27T19:59Z,"Thanx. Let's see if this one works.
@pecsi. You can also mount the iso as a virtual drive with Deamon tools. Saves you a CD."
,Demorgon,2007-04-03T18:05Z,So I assume this will work with the V3i as well? I mean when I hook my USB cable to a V3i shouldn't a removable disk be showing like when a camera is plugged in with a memory card? Will these tools to that or is there some hacks somewhere that can do that for me?
,aries_green_monkey,2007-04-10T08:23Z,"This is great! 

Except it is OLD, like V3.25

It doesn't work for my new L2!!! "
,kwohlfa,2007-04-29T19:32Z,anybody know if this works for the V3c. i tried to connect mine through the usb but it didn't appear to work w/ it. any suggestions would be appreciated.
,toxygen3,2007-06-17T16:35Z,"I also have an L2 without camera. 
A coworker, with an L2 but with camera, told me to update, update, update.... in total he laughed and said he had to update about thirty times for his L2 to register with the software.
So if it works, it works.
Hopefully better than ixchange."
,lovellyvee,2008-08-06T22:58Z,would this work for a w490?
