This is a self-extracting (with WinRAR) archive containing PDF versions of nearly all of the published works by G.I. Gurdjieff, P.D. Ouspensky, and Rodney Collin -- the three leading exponents in the West of the so-called "Fourth Way" tradition of self discovery and conscious evolution. 
For those seeking a good introduction to Gurdjieff's ideas and methods, I would recommend Ouspensky's masterpiece "In Search of the Miraculous" or Collin's "Theory of Eternal Life".
