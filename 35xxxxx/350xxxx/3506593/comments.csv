,Mr_Ecks,2006-07-24T17:18Z,I would have checked them out... but self-extracting. Not on my computer. There is more often than not a reason for not letting You check a file for viruses and trojans before extracting.
,winstonwsmith,2006-07-27T19:50Z,"Well, I hope paranoid dude there is wrong, because I've been wanting some Gurdjieff ever since I read volume one of Beelzebub's Tales and could never find the rest of them in my usual bookstores.  Thanks, hydrogen12 (unless of course Mr_Ecks's suspicions prove well-founded).  Guess I'll find out."
,GraphMaN,2006-07-27T20:48Z,"Gurdjieff RULEZ!
Thanks !"
,hydrogen12,2006-07-28T11:29Z,"Hope you like it. Although 'Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson,' Gurdjieff's magnum opus, is a long read, it's worth your time.  His second book, 'Meetings with Remarkable Men,' an autobiographical account, is another favorite. "
,lightbearer,2008-01-28T03:13Z,"Wonderful collection, thanks a lot! This is safe download, no trojans, viruses or whatever."
,iados,2008-04-25T15:46Z,Thanks!
,leet_enough,2008-07-07T22:41Z,"It's not self extracting, you need winrar to extract it.

Also the uploader probably packed it like this so no books would stop being seeded."
,AustinUSA,2009-11-29T06:07Z,Thanks Guys...I strongly recommend you read Osho's views on Gurdjeiff...he understands him best
,PMFsisa,2011-09-15T14:33Z,"To all the paranoid guys: Torrent works flawlessly, now I have a complete collection of Fourth Way works + much more.
If you're so afraid of self-extracting archives, stop being a pussy, go right-click them and 'Open in WinRAR' (in new version, it's 'Extract files...').
Also, I recommend you get Threatfire combined with an antivirus of your choice."
,Dramat,2011-11-14T22:37Z,"Thank You!
Very Nice Collection!
With Ouspensky: ""Tertium Organum"" and Gurdjieff ""must read"" trilogy: 
[1] Beezlebub's Tales'
[2] Meeting with Remarkable Men
[3] Life is Real only then, when ""I am""
:)"
