,Maria1984,2006-09-07T21:12Z,"Thanks...   But I have some problems with replacing the files. Just one of them can be replaced, but not WgaLogon.dll and WgaTray!!

Plz. I'll be gratefull if u could help. Thanks buddy"
,NNT~Dark Deity,2006-09-08T06:27Z," It's not really all that hard when you think about it...especially when you've got multiple hard drives with an OS on each. I've got 3...2 with Win 2k Pro and 1 with XP Pro Corp. If you have more than 1 HDD with windows then boot onto the second HDD and replace the files on the first HDD while logged into the second HDD...windows can't skrew you that way because the files aren't running. If you can't do that then heed these words from  :If you can't replaced the file ""WgaLogon.dll"" nether in normal mode or safemode do the following thing: 


Copy the ""WgaLogon.dll"" to the root direcory on C: (you can in fact put in anywhere, but this requires smallest amount of typing :) 


Boot up with your windows CD and choose the recovery console. 


Go to the root directory on C: and type ""copy WgaLogon.dll c:\windows\system32"" (without the """" of course) 


Type ""exit"" and you're done :)

(To:  Sry for the plaigerism m8....but copy and paste is quicker...besides...it's helpful advice, lol....couldn't have put it better myself [^.^])"
,NNT~Dark Deity,2006-09-08T06:30Z,"er....sry about that....the secondary advice was from a guy on here named Xhypo....forgot that [] makes it not show up, lol....sry Xhypo....good advice though if you read it...thx for it"
