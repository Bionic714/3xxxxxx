,martinleonard,2006-08-18T10:02Z,works fine if u actually copy the crak from the deviance folder - found by mounting the iso image with demon tools then opening up that drive - into your game installed folder
,martinleonard,2006-08-18T10:04Z,read the install notes and follow number 4 or you will get the insert cd message - follow instructions people and things will work
,martinleonard,2006-08-19T17:23Z,once cracked make sure u mount the iso image with demon tools otherwise the game will start to run and the crash to desktop asking for the game cd
,paulbr,2006-08-22T20:45Z,"Well eventually got it working -  my fault, I burned a game disc, installed it, cracked it and it didn't work.
You need to keep it mounted!! silly me."

,BllkWidDo,2008-06-25T10:25Z,"sigh this game works perfect i dont get these peeps problems 
step1: unpack.
step2: burn image to disc or mount using    appropriate software(daemon tools,poweriso,magiciso,alcohol120%,nero imagedrive.  you dig?)
step3: install game
step4: copy crack from from image to same directory as original cars.exe(overwrite existing file-yes)
step5: keep image mounted or in drive if u burned to disc and start game using craeked.exe
step6:delete game if still not working cause it means u r dumb shit and will have to buy all your games from the shop hahahahahahaha!!
