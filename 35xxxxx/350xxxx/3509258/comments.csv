,dubius_asshat,2006-08-06T06:00Z,"Thanks for banging out the crack RELOADED,  but..

As asked above, what is this ""addon"" that's mentioned.  I ask because nothing's working from this release,  for me.  I'm guessing I missed something somewhere where this ""addon"" is applied.  (By nothing working,  I mean that installing is flawless, but absolutely nothing happens when attempting to launch the game.  Crack applied properly and everything...)"
,dubius_asshat,2006-08-06T06:53Z,"Cancel that.  I need the Directx version that was on the CD itself (9.0c),  apparently my current DirectX 9.0c was insufficient.

Cheers!"
,Dog909,2006-08-06T10:55Z,"Also - this fixed exe works online :)
I played last night for about 2 hours - My 2
LAN'd pc's both have this fixed exe 
& connect to a single net connection through a router. 
Both played no problems. No crashes.
Reloded, I salute you. [As always]

The same thing happens to me, crashes after 3-4 mins. Some people says you need to install the latest starforce drivers to maybe make it work. The latest dirver is also included in the 1.1 patch, so my question is: Will there be a crack that supports the 1.1 version?"
[V],jockas_,2006-09-20T14:30Z,"Nice, does anyone know if there is a cracked v.1.1?
I know its a beta but still, the cracked game dosent work with the updates and you need to reinstall.. So please fix a crack  for 1.1 :)"
