This will break compatiblity with most set-top players however."

,damienfrost,2006-07-11T15:10Z,"Thanks as always BadServo.
However, this file seems to be doing strange things to my computer when I try to run it.  Like causing explorer to crash.  I'm sure that I'll get it worked out, but perhaps there's something to be said for standard formats.

Anyways, thanks again!"
,damienfrost,2006-07-11T15:29Z,"Alright, I lied, I can't figure it out.  Anything I do with the file causes my player, and sometimes my whole computer to crash.  I've tried three different players with the same result.  Is there a special codec or something that I need perhaps?

Thanks."
