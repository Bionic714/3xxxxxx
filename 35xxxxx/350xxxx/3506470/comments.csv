It runs the program, and loads things, but when almost done (loaded hull.hul or something like that) I get a error message.. I'll try it with win XP, and come back here to say results.."
,Tysss,2008-05-07T17:54Z,"jep, works with XP, doesn't work with Vista."
,Madtrax2008,2008-05-12T19:30Z,"It actually works in vista guys!

Just select the start icon (Revolt.exe) and set it to Windows 98 compatibility mode.

Then right click Revolt.exe and make a shortcut to Revolt.exe

Now right-click the shortcut and select properties.

Now add the line""(space)-sli to the target path:

-Example-
D:\Games\Revolt\revolt.exe -sli

Click ok and double click the shortcut :-)

Whoosh!  , good old times."
