,Skallekorv,2006-08-05T02:01Z,THNX to a non swedish spoken movie for kids......
,theponyboy,2006-08-05T11:28Z,yes! the kids will miss the massive amount of dialouge coming from Donalds mouth in disneys short films! *;-)
,brekkel,2006-08-30T12:33Z,"hhahaha fuck the swedish, they only put movies with scandic subtitels on the net.

thnx for this one"
,Tiffany1,2006-09-01T14:26Z,"The ""spanish-talking"" people are they, who takes away the nordic languages the most.
And don´t forget that the Pirate Bay started in SWEDEN!!!!!
I think that everyone who fixes an upload should keep all the languages, to be helpful towards everyone who are looking for a nice film!!!
Don´t you agree? 

...ni svenskar, det finns andra sidor som bara har filmer med svenska texter. Behöver ni ett tips om vilka jag menar, så skriv en rad här!!!"
[V],Moitas,2006-09-03T19:08Z,"ja skriv in ett par länkar till bra svenska torrentsidor, tack! =)"
,Tiffany1,2006-09-04T11:05Z,"Känns som det är lite krig här på Pirate Bay,
många spansktalande som utesluter alla nordiska undertexter men sparar bulgariska, hebreiska m fl.
Trist att det har blivit så, eller hur?

Testa dessa, 
endast/only for Swedish & the Nordic countries,
takeabyte.org, piratebits.org
Hoppas det kan vara till hjälp! :-)"
,downloaden,2006-10-12T18:54Z,"thats richt,brekkel, fuck the swedish let them putt all subs on the torrents mayby there like Germans,, Deutschen!! more dutch!!! subsss plaeszzz"
,ntf04pbn,2006-11-25T12:12Z,"Damned be all of those not having the courtesy to be greatful to the Swedes, they´re the originators of this shit you´re using for free!
Dutch huh? Great country...what good have you done? Tulips and windmills. Really modern and hi-tech, haha.."
,Moepster,2007-02-25T13:34Z,"Tulips and windmills, shit you are still in the middle ages. Get educated. The Dutch thrive on their knowledge economy. OUr knowledge on subject like water management. Example: Palm Jebel Ali.

Comment like yours just state your ignorance and the fact that you are saying something without doing your homework.

I personally am grateful for this site and thank the swedes for it. My appreciation is great. Thanks for the Dutch subs too btw :D"

Legalizing and marketing grass in all forms!

""Ok, ok, apart form the Windmills, the tulips and the weed, what have the duch ever done for us??""
(For those dont smile at that, watch Monty Python's Life of Brian)
