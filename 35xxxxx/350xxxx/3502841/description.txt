THE EVENT
Over the past 27 years, SkiDay has evolved into one of the ?largest river beach events in the United States? according to the U.S. Coast Guard. SkiDay is presented as a day of music, contests and prize giveaways. The ?event?, however, is actually the boaters themselves, congregating to celebrate their chosen pastime. Now the icon of the boaters? social calendar, SkiDay is considered by the boaters of the Tri-State as ?our day?.

In addition to the music, contests and prizes, SkiDay boasts two wildly popular events that have become iconic to the thousands of attendees; ?The King of the Beach Competition? and ?The World Famous SkiDay Bikini Contest?.
