This is still a good download even if I had to wait an extra fifteen minutes or so to listen to these (after re-transcodeing). I just went and smoked some while I waited. Now, I feel better and am enjoying Joan Jett right now even as I type this.... 

Wow!!! Ebony and Ivory I haven't heard that in years thanx dude for the download..."
