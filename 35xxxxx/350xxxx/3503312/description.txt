A few words about this MIXAMIX_20040417:
so what's up my friends! I see u liked my mixes so far so I continue spreading more stuff.
About this cd now. Not a very fast paced mix. 
Rythmic trippy songs. A new mix from myself on Nightmare on Wax - Play On. More on this BT,Moby, Prodigy,
Oakenfold, Neneh Chery - Buffulo Stance (new intro), Run DMC,Everything but the Girl, Man with No Name, Hybrid,
Signet and Astral Projection give the trancy feeling to complete the whole image! 
Still wondering how it is possible to combine all this different kinds of music.
Just download an listen to this mix.
