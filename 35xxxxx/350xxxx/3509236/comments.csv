,Freddy_Boom_Boom,2008-02-17T00:04Z,"This one does not work as it is. Its missing the video segment along with the dmi and the pfi sectors. The good news is its region free and can be repaired using DVD Mulleter. I repaired it myself and it now works perfectly. Here are the simple instructions...

1) Open the nrg image file with DVD Mulleter have it make a dvd file for you and then extract the video segment.

2) Dowload the security sectors from here...

3) Inject the video segment and the security security sectors with DVD Mulleter.

Thats it, you can now burn it with clone cd."
