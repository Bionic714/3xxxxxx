For some reason it says invalid image and when i try to change the extension it says write protected. Cant open the RTF file was well for the instructions at this time. Please advise what needs to be done at thist ime :) Thanks"
,technodoc,2006-10-23T22:55Z,"Sorry guys. I've gotten several complaints about the Eastern US disc. I guess $30 on eBay was too good to be true. I ripped the Western and Eastern disc on the same day with the same software, so I'm not sure why one works and the other doesn't.
Are you interested in a re-rip/re-seed?"
,piratesheem,2006-10-24T03:10Z,YEAH!! If you could re-rip/re-seed that would be awsome. thanks a million man...
,omegams,2006-11-27T17:16Z,"Can someone seed this please, it is at .01kB/s and I'm stuck at 84 percent."
,ernicoats,2006-11-27T19:21Z,can we get some seeders???
,piratesheem,2006-11-27T22:54Z,no point in dowloading this right now as this image is corrupted and the new image has not been uploaded yet.

it working for me to unpack it after that!

in other case contact me then will i uppload a new tor for it."
,ernicoats,2006-11-29T22:03Z,what he said above works just installed this on the n2 nice improvement over the 50
,gotbud,2006-12-04T04:00Z,"hey, i repacked the files so there is no more errors on mounting or extracting. Then i tried to make a new torrent for the file but everytime i click on upload i get a page not found error. So if you stick to upgrading to winrar 3.61 then go tools then to repair this will fix any mount or extract errors. thanks for the great upload and thanks to bi133036 for the simple fix.

,Hypnosis4U2NV,2006-12-06T01:45Z,"A suggestion:

How bout you .rar the folder for each state so that we can actually download the states we want rather than waiting to download the entire 2.37GB file..  Im only interested in NY, NJ, CT, PA, MA, and FL.."
,abcheng,2007-04-07T20:48Z,"I'm still getting the ""invalid image"" error in alcohol and virtual daemon even after repairing the archive. I can however extract the mdf in winrar which seems to be fine. Is this ok, and if so what options do I need to select in order to burn it in nero?

thanks."
