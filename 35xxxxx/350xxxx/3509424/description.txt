  I hear that you and your band have sold your turntables and bought guitars... 

  Haha, not quite -  From latin tinged breakbeat and retro-lectro, to sweaty 
  disco funk and all out distorted electronic rock, we present one of our more
  diverse mixes so far.  We've aimed to combine what we see as an exciting 
  scene in the crossover of rock and dance music, with people's taste becoming
  more diverse and the music they make equally so.  From scenes old to new and
  with the dna of dance running through them it's here for you lose it to.

  Good Evening Internet! Are you ready to ROCK???  

  So this is it, #3.  As we say, it's off with the latin (even football match 
  like) flavour of the Dust/Chemical Brothers mix of T-Baby before cutting it 
  into the patchwork Morning Lemon (from the Block Rockin' Beats EP).  The
  legendary Bassbin Twins return with the rough, beaty Out of Hand which we roll 
  into Krafy & Tim's cheeky Bass Phenomenon. From here we take a disco turn,
  throwing more of a raw, stomping flavour with The Electric Press, Huntemann
  and Cirez D until we drag Axer's nagging, grimy groove of 123 into the 
  screaming Disco-rock fury of Hystereo's superb Executive Memo.  A brief cut
  back house for the rush of Tom Parris and onto the amazing mutant house
  groove of Switch's remix of Want 2 Need 2, ramping up the energy for the drop
  of the Soulwax cover of Daft Punk's Teachers to set it all off.  A Soulwax and
  Daft Punk theme continues with Soulwax's Nite Version of Miserable Girl (yes, 
  it follows Teachers on the CD too but it sounds great so who are we to argue
  huh?!) with one of the most evil lead sounds ever, only really equalled by 
  the one on their mix of Daft Punk Is Playing At My House which is er, next!
  All this talk of Daft Punk allows us to introduce a cheeky bootleg of our 
  own - it combines Kid Alex's Lover Boy and Daft Punk's 2006 live version of
  Da Funk/Daftendirekt in one easy Disco friendly package for ease of dancing :)
  We finish off with a huge rock gesture (just like playing guitar solos
  on clifftops) - Vitalic's brash and rocking My Friend Dario - and if we 
  could include lights and fireworks with our mixes we would damn well have
  them all going off here like crazy!  

          So, ladies and gentlemen, you've been a wonderful audience,
                          Thank you and GOODNIGHT!
