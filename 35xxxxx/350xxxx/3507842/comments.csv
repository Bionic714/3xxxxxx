,Osaka,2006-11-23T01:50Z,"The FF7 OST is now available in higher quality MPC here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3562967/

It was ripped in Exact Audio Copy with Secure Mode."
,Necro-File,2008-03-05T05:11Z,"1: I've never heard of MPC, and the fact that it requires the use a player I don't like makes it that much more stupid.

2: That torrent is NOT the FF7 OST."
,Nintai,2008-04-18T23:37Z,"Thanks, awesome quality. 

And just for the record this version is much better than Osaka's torrent... unless you listen to your music in foobar lol. His version will not work in Winamp or any other media player I have tried. "
,Philonetic,2011-12-21T20:59Z,"Don't listen to Osaka, his file format is some crap codec that nothing likes.

For those looking for the best possible version of FFVII...
