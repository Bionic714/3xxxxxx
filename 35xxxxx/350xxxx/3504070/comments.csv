,Raptor007,2007-05-04T12:18Z,"Great soundtrack!  Thanks for sharing it!

The quality isn't the greatest; they used Joint Stereo, so there was some clipping introduced at loud parts.  Also seems like a low-quality MP3 encoder was used, since 192kbps should have clearer highs.  (Next time, try Fraunhofer and Full Stereo.)

Anyway, the quality isn't terrible, just not as good as I prefer.  :¬)"

För när jag gör det så står det bara att det inte är en torrent fil"
,made07,2008-01-01T09:26Z,"don't listen to what Raptor007 says... he has no clue what he's talking about. People claiming joint stereo was bad shouldn't be taken serious because they are _NOT_ right. The quality of this is really okay! If you want to _really_ increase it, take a more recent lame (3.97 instead of 3.92) and use VBR mode (-V 2 maybe). But _don't_ use simple (what he refers to as 'full') stereo, it only makes quality worse. The rumour that joint-stereo was bad only appeared because of some faulty FhG encoder and is absolutely invalid when using lame."
,made07,2008-01-01T09:30Z,"and for decreasing clipping I suggest using mp3gain. but the clipping is really the producers fault because of bad mastering. It's on the CDDA as well.

That said, I want to thank Nahojk for this great upload!"

God jul"
,jhUyYds,2011-03-10T22:26Z,"What raptor0077 said is correct, there is huge clipping distortion from over-amplification. 192 kBit joint stereo MP3 is not the problem, someone just performed manual labor to fuck it up."
