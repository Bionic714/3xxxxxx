,Shihiro,2007-04-19T13:45Z,"thank you very much for uploading this for us!

All you people who download, when finnished let it still seed for a day or two. Sharing is what this is all about. If you stop seeding to early after you are finnished downloading, the torrent will die and no one else can get it!"
