,cbwudang,2008-03-24T23:46Z,"I keep getting an error while trying to install this it goes to the installshield wizard goes to 100% and then flicks to as splash screen and crashes. Anyone got any ideas ?
"
,Pulsar_11,2008-06-01T19:04Z,"If ur have trouble installing (the installshield crashes) Follow the instructions below to install the game manually.
1) Using Windows Explorer, open the Quake II Mission pack CD\Data\ALL folder. Copy all of the contents of the folder into C:\Quake2\Rogue. If you don't have a Rogue folder in your Quake2 directory, then create the folder and copy all the files in ALL to that location.
2) Copy the contents of the patch folder to your Quake II folder. This will overwrite many of your existing files as it will upgrade you to v3.19.
3) If you want the movie files installed on your hard drive, copy the contents of the MAX folder to your Quake II folder.
4) Your Quake 2 directory should have:

Quake2\Rogue
Quake2\Rogue\video (optional)
Quake2\Rogue\docs

5) After successfully ""manually"" installing the Mission Pack. Click on Start > Run and type in:

C:\quake2\quake2.exe +set game rogue

This will load the Mission Pack. If your Quake II is located in a folder other than C:\quake2, then substitute the proper location when running the Mission Pack."
,Dadoslandes,2008-06-19T20:58Z,"I have another good option.

Create a shortcut to {CD root dir}\Install\SETUP.exe, activate and change the compatibility mode to ""Windows 95"". Then, run the shortcut.

Worked fine for me."

,GenesisFlux,2012-06-03T11:12Z,"To LoftyBird
you must burn the game to a CD and keep the CD in your disc drive while playing the game to get the music. OR install some kind of patch like the Ultimate Quake 2 Patch"
