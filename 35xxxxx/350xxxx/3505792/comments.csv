,jerno2000,2006-07-23T09:13Z,how did canada manage to produce a movie?
,ubercam,2006-07-23T17:04Z,"how did you manage to pull your head out of your ass long enough to type that comment? canada is a very attractive location for hollywood productions. tons of movies & tv shows get made here all the time, like x-files, smallville, capote, chicago, a history of violence, x-men, brokeback mountain, just to name a few. Don't forget india, they produce multiple times more Bollywood movies than Hollywood does per year. Fuckin asshole."
,cyborgen,2006-07-23T18:03Z,"Really hard to get subs for these ""rare"" titles -

,maxgunnar,2006-07-24T03:54Z,"as always, excellent quality but the book was much better ;) no offense Canada.  Perhaps I would of liked it better after some Molson's or MooseHead.  had to settle for that piss water they serve here in the South"

,tuppen2000,2006-08-19T12:41Z,"Den här filmen sög verkligen min Bacon-blåa Pung stenhårt...absolut sämsta film jag sett genom tiderna förrutom någon cam-porrfilm förstås !
Stellans Hollywood-pung-status måste ha sjunkit som en judes sparbössa"
,tuppen2000,2006-08-19T12:47Z,"I think that the canadians was the only creeps voted on IMDB...pull up the highscore like a eagles ass..
No Canadia!! Go back to farming and porn.

,bempastar,2006-08-20T23:22Z,"I get a ""green line"" across the screen :(
...and I think that this has something to do with the codec.

Im using the latest ""Mega codec pack 1.57"". Anyone else having trouble with this?"
,Saithe,2006-08-23T09:36Z,"Jag får samma gröna linje som Bempastar, men även färgerna har förvrängts, använder Xvid 1.1.0 codecen.
Nån som vet varför?"
,packep,2006-09-13T23:17Z,"I don't get it. The movie is horrible and it's about nothing. There's no point at all. I haven't read the book and there's no way I'm gonna do now....
Am I missing something here?"
,mintcar,2006-09-24T19:33Z,"""The book"" is a 1000 year old icelandic tale. I'm not sure that it would be very enlightening if you don't get the movie made last year ;)"
,mintcar,2006-09-24T19:37Z,"Or actually, it's an ancient english tale which is only known through a manuscript written down 1000 years ago by an islander."
,mintcar,2006-09-24T19:38Z,*icelander
,tiranth,2006-09-29T16:02Z,"i really hope you mean , that the ""tale"" is english.."
,fradrig,2006-11-05T12:36Z,"and, just to make things interesting, the tale is about a swedish warrior who travels to Denmark to defeat a troll. And this is GB's national poem?? weeeird... lol1

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf"
,Cargonnas,2006-12-06T16:12Z,"This is actually not so bad a movie, it is pretty true to the historical Viking Style, no hollywood interpretations, eventhough the setting is kindda Non-danish ( unless its on Bornholm, but i Guess Denmark was bigger in those times since they had invaded about half of Sweden ) but the reason I like the movie is because it has other stories to it other than troll-hacking, there is the also the religion-problem  the Ase-belief ( Valhalla, Odin and ect. vs. the christian-belief )
all in all, its a cool story worth investing 2 hours in.
please dont Flame if you choose to respond to this. just keep it clean"
,finse1222,2006-12-13T18:22Z,"Fun movie to watch if you have been to Iceland and travelled around the ring road.   Get to see all the sights again.

The Cliffs at the beginning are great,  over 200meters down to the ocean.

If you havent been to Iceland... its stunning,  and so easy to travel around...just follow the ring road...brings you back to your start point... eventually."
,RainbowRandolph,2007-03-31T13:18Z,Thanx for seeding!
,biggidude,2007-04-11T23:29Z,Mjög skemmtileg íslensk mynd :D:D:D
,Arrrmand,2007-07-28T13:29Z,"For those who wonder why the story of Beowulf is considered the ENGLISH national epic, you should learn a little about the origin of nations and peoples as we now know them. England itself inherits its name from a tribe that lived in northern Germany, near Denmark. The modern english people are a mix of picts, saxons, norsemen to put it bluntly. There's no such thing as originality when it comes to nations, cultures, countries or races."
,michaelcalvin54,2007-09-12T13:06Z,thanks axxo!
,rolly_32,2007-09-18T12:56Z,"Well yes it's a good movie, but I belive someone need to read the history a litle moore, Denmark was TRYING to invade Sweden 7 times, and ther bigest success was when they manige to take Skåne, Halland and Blekinge, about 3% of Sweden, they manige to keep this areal for about 3 years, than Sweden take it back, so half Sweden, well offcourse the people that don't look at the map or read the history offcourse will see it like half Sweden. Anyway, I like the movie, and some of it seams a litle to mush, but thats the way I like movies. Thanks for leting me download it."

,enlighten86,2007-11-22T23:52Z,So i guess everyone is all of the sudden an expert in history? Bet at least 70% of you flunked out of school because you were playing videos games! YES / NO? :P
,clokverkorange,2007-11-23T13:51Z,"I really dislike how Axxo will look at movies that are released currently, then find old versions of them. For Example: Transformers...

Other than that, I love axxo releases. I have over a hundred of them and now I only download axxo thanks to his quality rips. But please, axxo, if you're still here on the Bay, stop uploading old crap movies!!"

,stanleyman,2007-11-25T22:19Z,for me i think this is better then the new beowulf same as 300 new ones cool and all just not better
,denisgo,2007-11-27T20:53Z,hehe i saw it in the cinema last week im from Denmark and its a good movie but last i lookt out of the window we did not have mountains. but atleast they got our culture right.. but good movie but with the landscape it could be sweeden...
,barcodt,2007-11-28T00:22Z,"OMG. You people don't know anything and everything has to be so easy in your eyes. I'm from Iceland, this is one of the greatest tales ever written in Icelandic History. And the original name in Icelandic i Bjólskviða. Þið eruð asnalegir bandaríkjamenn sem megið fara til fjandans."

,olebangole,2007-11-30T15:33Z,axxo is the king of the Pirate Bay. hope he never stopps releasing!!!!
,CheezuzKraist,2007-12-01T05:40Z,mintcar. According to Wikipedia the writer of Beowulf is anonymous. Icelanders have Edda tales already. Soon you will claim that Odyssey and Bible were written in Iceland. LOL
,pygmyshrew,2007-12-01T15:38Z,"barcodt stfu and do your research, Beowulf & Grendel is a german folk tale originally, although this film is filmed in iceland."
,WiDKariya,2007-12-02T01:10Z,"Apparently Beowulf was a swedish guy, so why are you danes and icelanders even arguing ?"
,methodicalmadness,2007-12-02T06:33Z,No your all wrong. Beowulf is a tale of mexican descent. In the language of the ancient wetbacks...............  SHUT THE FUCK UP AND ENJOY THE FLIX.
,fartoeasy,2007-12-02T11:52Z,måste vara den värsta skit som gjorts! evil aliens verkar ju som en toppfilm i jämförelse:/
,Tragon,2007-12-02T13:34Z,"Omg, never seen so many typos and bad spelling...
About the history....well so far none has got it right.
Denmark ruling scandinavia? kk, go back to school."
,Kamigawa,2007-12-02T17:07Z,"OK.. SO, first of all, this is the old version ust so all the people who are to uneducaded to find out by them selves, and secound, im pretty bad at spelling, but dude! For some of these comments you have to guess half of the words you are writing! OMG! Learn to spell!
And then to the movie itself, I didnt like it, but it offers a very good view into the lives of the vikings, and it was kinda intresting to see how the priest got the vikings to become kristian, so from a historical point of view, nice movie, but not much for the pure entertainment part.

And then, for the guy who said that he would like to visit Iceland before it melts, it was actually named it Iceland so that everyone thought that it would be covered in ice and therefore wouldn´t wanna invade it, cause who would want to live in a country covered in ice?
Except for the eskimoes...
Yeah but iceland is for a fact NOT covered in ice!"
,Anholy,2007-12-02T18:36Z,"Hmm. im suprised there wasn't any"" OMFG THIS R NOT THE NEW MOVIE!! J00 SUCK N000B!!!!!""

,FirstArchangel,2007-12-07T01:12Z,"I liked the movie a lot and it played perfectly as long as it was not in fullscreen, and even then, the quality was not that bad! Not being new to computers but new to downloading media, are there programs out there that will improve the performance of these downloads when viewed in fullscreen??"
,adamkatt,2007-12-08T18:01Z,crap movie!!  the troll is supposed to regenerate lost limbs!
,shAzbot,2007-12-09T05:27Z,Zjohn you forgot an e.
,Chainsaw,2007-12-12T10:35Z,"Adamkatt: Grendel isn't a troll. He's a demon. Yes, I know that it says 'troll' in the notes, but if you read the actual story, you'll notice a distinct lack of trolls. And the whole 'trolls regenerate lost limbs' thing is an concept that Wizards of the Coast came up with for the roleplaying game D&D. The tale of Beowulf is approximately 1600 years older than that."
,adamkatt,2007-12-13T01:27Z,Stuuupid demon trolls....  They SUCK!

,w0tness,2008-04-01T05:01Z,"Moogle2k7: There is absolutely no point in capitalizing the first letter of every word you type, in fact it is quite annoying, so you can spare yourself the trouble.

In other news; looking forward to this movie as another perspective than the commercialized version, and to see some more of Iceland. :)"

SEED!"
,zacke83,2008-04-14T03:18Z,"WTF,,i cant get sound, how do i do ?"
,Wittekind,2008-05-12T15:22Z,"I guess Beowulf didn't have any nationality like nowadays at that time.
But he could possibly come from Lower Saxony, that is in NorthEast-Netherlands and Northern-Germany, my people, or even Frisian.

But otherwise he could be from the Viking countries, and where do all the Icelanders/Swedes/Norsemen/Denmark and some Finnish originate? Denmark off course and where do the Danish originate? Saxony!"
,bennyoneil,2008-05-19T18:55Z,wittekind you knob end! beowulf is from Wales....hehe
,TheHarvester,2008-10-03T01:59Z,"adamkatt if you consider yourself ""fantasy fan"" as someone may guess from your post, you should make the difference between fantasy and mythology."

,xanthippe13,2009-07-22T21:03Z,quality ok but not excellent
,xtremnik,2010-05-06T05:54Z,"Video quality typical of Axxo = Great.

Movie is slow paced but realistic.
Not the typical hollywood bullshit. So if you're into hollywood nonsense don't watch this.

I love it because it has great nordic / Germanic themes...Basically shows the reality of emotions, and there's also a good critic of Christianity and its faulty morality which isn't needed to men and which fucked the Viking's brains :)

In any case, watch and enjoy.
Thanks for the upload and seed"
