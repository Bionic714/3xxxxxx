But an appeal for you to seed the Hovering above the Towers 4 discs again. 

I (and others) are 90% through downloading and I'd much prefer Radiohead in lossless.

Congrats again for bringing us such excellent sets."

,spranfra,2011-10-16T16:49Z,"So, as I go through and make sure all the tags and data are perfect, as I am wont to do, I find that the track ""In My Mind (w/The Pixies)"" from Disc 21 isn't on the releases I know of.  Also, ""Life in a Glass House"" (track #378) from disc 22 is missing.  If anyone can help me, perhaps find these files, I will seed a perfectly ID3 v 2.4 tagged version.  Otherwise, this is complete and amazing.  Well done."
