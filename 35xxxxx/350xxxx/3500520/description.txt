This is the motherload - 24 discs, 412 songs, 2.34 gigs
For true Radiohead fans, this has everything you could ever want (b-sides, remixes, early versions, on a friday demos, etc.)

This collection was upped bij Wiak2 on megaupload. For all the people who want to download this faster,
I have put this on Bittorent. 

Many thanks to Wiak2 !
