,Son Of Mogh,2006-08-07T21:55Z,"Is this better than the not yet repacked version i just downloaded or what? Maybe I should only download cd2 which is repacked, or won't that work? "
[T],sotis,2006-08-07T23:05Z,"@ Son of Mogh: The nfo from the repacked CD2 says: ""We missed a little of attention on CD2 format, but now its properly fixed!""
It should work fine to only download CD2 from here!"

,koolgirl88,2012-08-08T18:55Z,"Hi, everyone is asking a lot of questions about mounting, I used to get confused too.

1) Download ""UltraISO"" it's a free trial.
2) When you load this torrent, go to downloads and click ""CD1"" and unzip one of the files. When you click the new unzipped folder, there should be an ISO file in there (it looks like a purplish CD).
3) Go back and do the same with ""CD2"", unzip one of those files, and when you click the new unzipped folder, there should be another ISO file in there.
4) Open the UltraISO program, and click the picture icon on top that says ""Mount to Virtual Drive."" It's the 9th icon from left. Click the ""..."" button, go to the new unzipped folder in CD1, choose the ISO file, and then click ""Mount."" When it's done, you can close it.
5) Go to ""My computer"" and you will see a loaded file on ""CD Drive E."" Click it, click setup, and run the download. 
6) Halfway through, it will ask to put CD2. Go back to My computer, right click the CD Drive E, go to ""UltraISO,"" and then choose ""Eject.""
7) Open the UltraISO program, click ""Mount to Virtual Drive,"" (should say ejected now), click ""..."" and go to CD2 to the new unzipped folder, and click the ISO file in there. Pick this file and click ""Mount."" When it's done, close it. 
8) Go back to the download that has been paused and click ""ok."" The download should finish now, but it will tell you to re-insert CD1 at the end.
9) Go back to My computer, right click CD drive E, and eject it from UltraISO.
10) Go back to UltraISO, click Mount to Virtual Drive, click the ""..."" and choose the same ISO file in the CD1 unzipped folder, and then mount it. Once it's done, exit.
11) There should be an icon for Danger by design on the desktop somewhere, click it and you can play.

Hope this helps!"
