One of the best Vietnam movies ever made. Realistic, brutal, terrifying. 
While some movies make war look like a fun adventure, this one shows the brutal truth, from the perspective of a ground soldier. 
Written and directed by Oliver Stone, who himself served in Vietnam, the film is loosely based on his experiences there. 
Winner of four Academy Awards including Best Picture.
