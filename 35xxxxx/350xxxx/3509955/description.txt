The Swedish bands excellent 1967 album which was recorded at Abbey Road and owes a debt to Sgt. Pepper. The album is here in its entirety with five bonus tracks. Quality harmonic psychy '60's pop music that deserves to be heard and throughout a definite UK '60s psych pop vibe pervades with shades of The Small Faces, Beatles, and Who.
