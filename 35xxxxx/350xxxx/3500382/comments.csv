,wmgan,2006-07-03T07:00Z,"To sinsliveforever:

I don't ""think people want to see less of one of the greatest movies ever"". I certainly don't. This is just an alternative way of viewing LOTR, not a replacement. More different versions of a great film interpretation of one of the greatest stories ever written? Hell yeah!

I actually put this back on TPB for the benefit of someone who wanted to finish the download (it appears that the torrent was taken off TPB during the police raid). But now that a few people have started to download it, I have to say this:

(to be continued ...)"
,wmgan,2006-07-03T07:05Z,"Some of you will be disappointed with the video quality (though hopefully not the editing). I made this using XviD sources, because that's all I had at the time I did the editing (I didn't want to bring my entire DVD collection to college so I ripped them to XviD)."
,wmgan,2006-07-03T07:05Z,"Some time ago, I posted on the OriginalTrilogy forums that I would make a high-quality version of this using DVD sources this summer. I don't think I'll be doing that right away, though -- I definitely plan to redo this edit eventually -- in high quality and with 5.1 audio -- but not right away. So for now, this is all I have to offer -- but I think it's still enjoyable."
,thexrock,2006-07-03T07:12Z,"yeah, i watched it, it aint bad, i mean it does leave out the love story with arwen."
,Miiqu,2006-07-03T14:47Z,Well if it leaves out that bloody lovestory then its even greater then the greatest movie ever itself !
,B-manSwe,2006-07-04T20:30Z,"This is bullshit, to cut such a masterpiece is stupid, its like reading the first ten pages of the book and then the ending and say that you read all of tolkiens books, why i say, why...and in badass quality 2..."
,wmgan,2006-07-05T00:52Z,"I agree, to just extract the beginning and the ending of a novel would be absolutely stupid.

But to take a 1000-page novel and condense it into a novella, like the Readers' Digest Condensed Editions -- now that's an art."
,X3MSteeler,2006-07-05T01:54Z,"You have done a great job, wmgan.

Even though the quality is pretty poor I really enjoyed it.

It sure is an alternative to spending the whole day with the extended versions.
And the changes you've made in the timeline made it a little bit ""new"".
Really loved the overlays with the maps as well.

Hope you get around to make the high quality version asap."
,wmgan,2006-07-05T06:45Z,"Thanks, X3MSteeler!

Actually, I think I overdid it with the map overlays -- I'll probably use them more sparingly (and thus hopefully more effectively) in my next (high-quality) version, whenever I get around to doing it."
,aztekkrille,2006-11-04T11:31Z,"Why do anyone wanna cut the greatest movie of all times.
Every minute of those 11+ hours is like an hour in heaven!

Dont cut this!"
