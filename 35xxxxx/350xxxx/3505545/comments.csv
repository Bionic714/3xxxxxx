,eatmars,2008-03-08T00:57Z,"use Daemon tools to mount this 4 cds
people dont waste your time downloading this its not for beginners. 
you will only say a german word but they will not tell you the english translation of that word so it suck. your saying the words but you really dont understand it. If anyone of you have FLUENZ its much better than this crap

download it here -----> www.daemon-tools.cc"
,kaufise,2008-05-16T11:18Z,"this prgramm want a Lern CD oh man ey, i have vista and Daemon lite......

,idkwut2puthere,2009-06-07T14:56Z,"Can someone PLEASE write down a step by step on how to install this properly on a comp with Windows XP? 

There are instructionals up the ass for Rosetta Stone. But I did my research and found that Tell Me More is much better. However, still a n00b with computers, there's no way I can install this program the right way without some detailed instruction. 

CAN SOMEONE PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE help me?!"
,hoangheo,2009-07-22T15:54Z,"1. download and install the deamon tools from the its site as s.o has mentioned above. The installing process would require you to reboot
2. use deamon tools to mount the first CD, use the serial number in the text file in the same folder you have downloaded your torrent.
3. mount the second CD in order to run your Tell Me More - German etc."
