,69theye,2006-07-12T11:04Z,"Does anyone have a problem that the video ""looses"" sound after watching around minute? Maybe a bad codec?"
,chundergut,2006-07-22T19:19Z,"To DrWrong, the video is definately encoded with ac3 stereo sound, which means you may not have the correct codec.

Copy and paste this url in to your browser:
http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Codec_Pack.htm
then click on the link to download and intall K-lite full,  which will then put the codec you need on your PC. You should then have no trouble playing the video."

to Aezuregos & DrWrong:

If you already have the codecs then you can convert the entire file to DVD now it depends on the program that you use, for example, using Sony DVD Architect may need to convert the file to a supported file (I've had some errors using .mp4 with DVD Architect even with the latest version).

My advise would be to use Nero Vision, it can use any codec that you have on your computer, for more info you can try asking or searching on http://codecs.freeforums.org/
so you can learn more about what codecs are and the best way to configure them.

Hope this info can lead you to answer your questions."
