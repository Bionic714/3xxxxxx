,PH-MCS,2006-07-30T14:34Z,"yeah it's real big but mid you this is the COMPLETE cd including some seaplane base scenery and some videos of the real plane, but if you think it's to big I could trow the vids out"

,4X-AXG,2006-07-30T15:03Z,"well let's narrow it down..my install file (which as SP2 embedded) is 49.8 MB big. installed it takes up 238 MB, and on top of my head, I think it includes the scenery as well. how large is your CD excluding the vids?"
,PH-MCS,2006-07-30T15:09Z,"without the vids it's 114 Mb,
your saying i should dump the vids and the extra thingies like acrobat and stuff?"
,4X-AXG,2006-07-30T15:47Z,it doesn't matter to me..a full pack is nice too :)
,PH-MCS,2006-07-30T16:06Z,allrighty then  ;)
,BritneysOrifice,2006-07-30T17:22Z,"Much obliged for this upload! So this full pack is v2 with SP2?  I, too, have a standalone installer, but would love to have a full, up-to-date CD.  I really liked this plane, its history, etc.   That's why I'd like to have the full CD as well.  So.... anyone know if it's an up-to-date release?"
,WinnieXL,2006-07-30T17:23Z,Welkom here! 
,PH-MCS,2006-07-30T18:05Z,"yeah this is the full up-to-date version of the cd (V 2) including two videos of the real plane in action (really old, they're not flying anymore).

ps bedankt winnie ;)"

,Tri_Motor,2006-07-30T19:49Z,"Thanks PH-MCS for the upload.... I have 1 question though... I see files B314disk1.zip, B314disk2.zip & B314disk4.zip in the index... is there suppose to be a B314disk3.zip?"
,PH-MCS,2006-07-30T20:57Z,"yeah now you mention it i just checked my original cd and it also misses disk3 but it all works on my computer so i guess it's just a little f*ckup from the guys at Pilot's

Good catch! ;)"
,Tri_Motor,2006-07-30T21:20Z,"PH-MCS... LoL I have seen that done on other software... they make changes to the file structure and are to lazy to update the file names... LoL

Thanks again... I look forward to this bit of aviation history !"
,PH-MCS,2006-07-30T21:44Z,"anyone got it yet?

,PH-MCS,2006-07-30T22:03Z,"another question i've just uploaded the martinair md-11 rip from itvv, do you guys think i should've  uploaded it with the fs-2004 prefix or  not?"
,PH-MCS,2006-07-31T18:07Z,Great :)
