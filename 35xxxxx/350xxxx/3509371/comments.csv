,Mustah,2008-02-07T11:35Z,I'm getting an error saying : ''Can't connect to the handler'' and ''Problem finding the instance of realguitar''. Anyone knows how I can fix it?
,rizla12,2008-03-11T18:49Z,"Hm is this the one where the only crack is an .reg file, and with no crackinstructions? Cause IÂ´ve tried that and I canÂ´t get it to work, have tried both running the .reg file and putting it in the realguitar folder, but the program is still just a 30days trial.. Any tips?"
,rizla12,2008-03-11T18:52Z,"Ah, nevermind, found out how to do it.."

then select the rlg2 file as your registration file

then boom your done"
,Kabraxis-,2008-06-25T01:10Z,"I'm a Vista user and this key is not working correctly. When i try to crack it, an error message appears which is ""This is not a valid key file!"". Any suggestions or is there any other crack?

-And where can i find sound patches except Acoustic:Steel Fingered?


@Mustah: Copy RealGuitar.dll from Program Files/Musiclab/Realguitar to your VST folder (probably on Program Files/VST Pluigins)"
,hhhw,2008-07-13T06:56Z,thankssss.
,chungwa,2008-11-02T04:16Z,"I dont think this is a very good release. I've had this installed for 6-9 months and have just started to get to grips with it when all of a sudden it doesn't recognise chords properly anymore. Smells like protection to me... 


There are several different guitar sounds to choose from, just select from the dropdown menu when it says 'select guitar' on startup. "
,Daxter77,2009-01-23T13:59Z,"I've installed for mac and the trial is works. When i click the register button i see the .key file, but is deactivated. 
I hope someone has a tip for me.

Regards"

,kilibong004,2010-04-27T07:36Z,does this plugin work in vista?
,glra2222,2010-05-23T06:29Z,"for all those who are getting the handler error message:
to ""run as administrator"" means to right click on the program and actually click ""run as administrator"".
I did this with fruity loops and it works now."
,GrandeFinale,2010-10-08T21:34Z,can someone help me i can't get it to work i run as administrator but useless..
,GrandeFinale,2010-10-11T23:26Z,found it here's how it works at last you must let guitar to open that windou with epired license and then you have somethin like browse for the license or something like that and after that go after the rlg key and pres open and then something apears some leters ive made it at last thnx works very well :)) 
,duel,2010-10-27T23:53Z,"Got the program installed & registered, but when I open the program, there is nothing to select under 'select guitar' and next to that it says '0 MB'! What the fuck's going on?!

Gonna try reinstalling, but this really doesn't look good. Using Win 7 Ultimate 64bit. Any suggestions appreciated."
,duel,2010-10-28T19:01Z,"Can anyone confirm whether or not they see this when it's installed;

http://img264.imageshack.us/img264/573/11269011.png

noting the top bit where you select guitar. Is that normal for it to have 0 MB and you're unable to select one to start with? Do I need to take another step in setting this up or has the installation fucked up somewhere?"
,duel,2010-10-28T19:42Z,"This is some serious fucking bullshit man. I've run Real Guitars Bank Manager / StgMan, I've extracted Acoustic.mls to the Real Guitar directory and it's not having it.

This has wound me up a treat. There is no way to browse to the banks from inside Real Guitar to just point at it and say 'There, the fucking bank is there, go get it' so I can select something. A google search bought up one other poor Spanish bastard who had the same problem & he couldn't get it fixed either. I can't see a way forward so unless someone can help me I'm pretty much out of options."
,duel,2010-10-28T20:20Z,"Okay, got it working. With the bank manager, you need to tick ALL the boxes. I was under the impression each box was for the same sound bank, but for different sound qualitys / bit rates. Maybe it is, but the largest one I originally picked wasn't compatible with my soundcard? In any case, I ticked them all and I can now select a guitar.. probably at the expense of much hard drive space."
,jem888,2011-01-11T02:29Z,Thx man
,timmyt4,2011-03-19T10:04Z,Thanks. Grt app. Works & reg perfectly.
,rocky77777,2011-04-21T14:39Z,i think it is for mac
,lilnemo_music,2011-07-07T00:19Z,"Great Upload by the way it works fine. My only issue is how can I .dll to work in the VSTplugins

I try copying and pasting it to the VSTplugin in Cubase 5 but Cubase doesnt recognize it. Please help."
,dartb,2011-10-10T00:20Z,"@rocky77777: Why would a .exe be for Mac?  Mac's use their own image files... (.dmg)

Works great, thanks uploader!"
