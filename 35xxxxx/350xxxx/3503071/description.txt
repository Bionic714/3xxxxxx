"I don't give out praise easily. However, this is a time when I am more than impressed; I'm astonished. This album is truly authentic to the best of what was being recorded in the mid to late 1970s New Age synthesizer scene. This recording is almost haunting. It's as if the talented musicians who recorded this album were transported through time and just started jamming. I was alive and listening in the mid to late 1970s. I've built my life around the sound of 1975 to 1985 New Age synthmusic. So, I feel that I am an authority on this subject. And I can safely say that this is a phenomenal disc. If you like Floyd, Parsons, Carlos, Tomita, Vangelis, Baumann, Tangerine Dream, or any of the other New Age notables of that era-- then give this a listen!"
