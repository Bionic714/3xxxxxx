,Xiahou Cao,2006-07-27T02:49Z,"mistal if your not going to help STFU and stop spamming, honestly i have no idea about installing the NA version over the UK version if that is even the problem, so help me please"
[T],sotis,2006-07-27T05:01Z,@ burtyboy: Maybe your download isn´t completed?  Run an SFV check to ensure that your archives are complete and accurate.
,luring1,2006-07-27T11:06Z,It works just fine for me. Thanx.
,evirus,2006-07-27T14:05Z,"replace file based crafc system? damn i want the one where you run an iso through anti-blaxx, seems more compatable with patches"
,Signation,2006-07-27T19:39Z,"hi, thanks alot for the rip it looks great. i unrared it, mounted it, installed it and patched it to 1.61, and i renamed the crack (the pirateboss one im assuming is the crack being that you said it was on the cd); and i have trouble using the interface. is there any other crack, like of cdcopyworld or something? also, theres trouble with the internet uses, i don't know if i'm just using the wrong crack here. any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks alot for the awesome rip :)."
,danthemanrocks2,2006-07-28T15:29Z,Got the game installed fine but having problems getting the game to launch. I mounted the image and installed it but when I launch it tells me wrong cd but i can't select to mount the other bin file.
,Xiahou Cao,2006-07-28T16:02Z,@ danthemanrocks2. did you crack it?
,danthemanrocks2,2006-07-28T16:23Z,can't find the crack that is the problem now. I unrared everything and i got 2 images i can mount but no crack.
,Xiahou Cao,2006-07-29T01:07Z,"go to My Computer, explore the mounted Civ 4 Warlords CD, find the crack, copy the crack over the installation directory. it should work"
,sedgee,2006-07-29T15:23Z,Thank you.
,Christer Romson,2006-07-31T02:01Z,"A tip for those who can't install: I had problems after selecting install from the autorun, but ""manually"" running setup.exe from cd worked.

This install will update your original Civ IV to version 1.61. I had a cracked 1.52, so now I can un Warlords but not the original Civ IV. No big problem, but Warlords won't open games I saved from Civ IV."
[T],sotis,2006-07-31T04:26Z,@ bobfree123: Please stop spamming!
,Xiahou Cao,2006-07-31T12:47Z,@ Christer Romson. thank you... i hope it works... but i deleted this Warlords so now i have to redownload it :P
,Xiahou Cao,2006-07-31T13:28Z,*sigh* still cant get it to work... can sombody tell me what torrent they downloaded for Civ 4?
,Christer Romson,2006-07-31T20:19Z,Civ4-with-crack-and-patch1.52.iso worked for me.
,Christer Romson,2006-07-31T20:20Z,... at http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3467207
,Xiahou Cao,2006-08-01T11:20Z,"... right so i still cant get it to work... it gives me the same error message. ""Sid Meier's Civilization 4 is not installed properly. Please re-install and then retry the Sid Meier's Civilization 4: Warlords installation.""... i can get Civ 4 to work but i cant even install Civ 4: Warlords... maybe its a problem on my PC"
,burtyboy,2006-08-01T14:54Z,Anyone have a ready-to-install version of this they could post?  I can't manage this RAR'ed version... :-(
,Vismaior,2006-08-01T19:42Z,"What's going on with Reloaded? this is their second work im having problems with, never before.
In this one, after instaling and replacing exe with the crack i get a nice message ""Sid Meier's Civilization 4 : Warlords has encountered a problem and needs to close.  We are sorry for the inconvenience."" etc.
Anyone else? any ideas?"
,danthemanrocks2,2006-08-03T17:57Z,All you who have problems wiht wrong version and things like that do not download the civ 4 torrents unless it is patch 1.61. Patch 1.61 is required for warlords so eithor redownload a different torrent or see if it works ingame to update in the advanced menu. I bought the original game and this torrent worked perfectly when I installeed it and right clicked on the second iso image or cue whatever it was and didn't hit autoplay but instead hit open and found the crack and copied and pasted it to the right spot and it worked perfectly.
,Vismaior,2006-08-03T21:28Z,"i had a previous version of civ4 torrent but i updated it with the official patch and works fine, but this release is not working. i get the same messeage over and over, the one asking whether  i want to report the problem with the program to microsoft."
,BigStackTony,2006-08-07T03:33Z,"Installed it!! Works fine!  I can play it but not multiplayer. I can still play multi with the Original CIV4. Anybody knows how I can fix this?

Thanks! "
,Hasar,2006-08-09T19:00Z,"hm, I have the same problem as Xiahou Cao..
""Sid Meier's Civilization 4 is not installed properly. Please re-install and then retry the Sid Meier's Civilization 4: Warlords installation.""
what shuld we do?"
,Xiahou Cao,2006-08-10T05:00Z,"well i only have 1 more test to do (if this test fails then i know its a problem on my PC not the torrent), im going to install the Civ 4 that Christer Romson gave me, then im going to install this civ 4 warlords on by brothers PC... if it works on his PC then i'll know its my PC's problem... if i doesnt work then im really going to be confused"
,BW2!,2006-08-12T15:39Z,"Does it work??

Svara gärna i svenska."
,Xiahou Cao,2006-08-12T17:35Z,it seems to work for most people
,blackideas,2006-08-14T01:24Z,"Guys that have a problem installing, you should reinstall civ4 then the update, then the expansion, then find the patch. 

If you have a cracked version of civ 4, the expansion won't install.  "
,blackideas,2006-08-15T02:54Z,"now i have both versions cracked and they work well, The best thing with warlord (and patch 1,6)is that the engine lighter to run... If other people have problems installing it, i have 1-2 tricks in my sleeves for them"
[V],Murlok,2006-08-15T16:52Z,Thank´s for this one working fine
[V],Murlok,2006-08-17T11:09Z,Well not that fine asking for the warlords dvd????
,sindorium,2006-08-17T16:04Z,When I try to start the game it ask for the original CD! I think I've got the crack and placed it where it's supposed to be but i'm not sure. can someone please try to explaint to me where I can find the crack and where to place it? 
,mogita001,2006-08-30T18:40Z,"Here is my problem, I installed the game and before moving patch tried running it ""wrong cd erroe"" which i expected. Than after moving the crack i tried opening it and i got ""failure to load xml"". I am no newb but i believe somewhere along the line of moving the crack andrunning the program i made and erroe someone have an idea how to fix?"
,macinsoft,2006-09-02T03:19Z,"Which file should I mount, and which should I click to start the game?"
,Japub,2006-09-03T12:08Z,"I got the same problem as ""Vismaior"". The game is installed and the crack is where it should be but as I try to start the game it says there is some sort of error (Sorry for the inconveniece... blabla). I can choose to send an error report to Microsoft or to close the program. 

Could anyone tell me how to fix this problem? I've re-installed the game several times but it doesn't help."
,CarloCanning,2006-09-03T22:29Z,"Hi.  I've downloaded things before, but I've never seen something like this, so if someone would explain what I should do it'd be great.

What I've got is 31 WinRar achives, each of 14,649kb, each of which contain the file rld-civw.bin.  If I try to extract them using WinRAR it says it is corrupt.

What should I do?  Someone pity this noob."
,CarloCanning,2006-09-03T23:52Z,"I've the same problem as Vismaior & Japub.

Any solutions, boys?"
,Hebbe84,2006-09-06T17:11Z,"It works for me except that when the game tries to ""use"" the ottoman empire it chrashes whether you´re trying to choose them as civ or encounter them in the game. I have no idea why it does that but I doubt it can be fixed, probably something wrong with the crack"
,euthaniser,2006-10-01T21:51Z,It didn't work for me.  It crashes upon start of the first campaign.
,euthaniser,2006-10-01T22:42Z,"It works now.  I had to uninstall Civilization IV, reinstall, update, install the expansion--and then install the no-cd crack.  If you install the no-cd crack for the original version then install the expansion/crack it will not work.  Thanks for the upload."
,suprem kite,2006-12-15T21:34Z,where is the crack that makes it play
,TSand86,2006-12-22T02:23Z,how can i play the game with the update patch? once its installed the crack doesnt work anymore... 
,TSand86,2006-12-22T02:26Z,"by the way, tnx, great game!"
,Ezel,2007-05-13T15:58Z,"1. Install Civilization IV, DO NOT RUN THE GAME!!
2. Apply patch 1.61
3. Install Warlords expansion
4. Install ""Accidentally Unprotected"" Warlords 2.08 Patch
   (there is a new patch 2.08 out that has the CD-check intact. Avoid that!)
5. Install Crack for Patch 1.61 (can be found on gamecopyworld.com
6. Play!"
,simon_cukpb,2007-05-22T12:13Z,"I had problems unraring files rld-civw.r05 and r30. I'm trying again, but that could be the cause of the crash if your unrar is ignoring those errors. "

,JujitsuFreak,2007-07-14T17:30Z,"This game works great. HOWEVER, I tried to install the 2.08 patch and it's telling me the Warlords installation can't be found. Does this torrent contain the patch? I don't think it does - after checking out the ""About This Build"" selection. Is there a solution to installing the patch?

Thanks"
,JujitsuFreak,2007-07-14T17:33Z,"Ezel - where is the ""Accidentally Unprotected"" patch? Would you mind linking to it? Thanks!"
,Tibris,2007-07-26T19:27Z,Does anyone know how to get to the installation folder on Vista?  I managed to get the crack easy enough but i'm new to Vista and have no idea how to get to my installation folder 
,Tibris,2007-07-26T19:39Z,nevermind that was stupid of me i found it.
,JG234,2007-07-28T07:51Z,"Just thought I'd warn you guys not to download this file.

The retarded gimp that made the image obviously couldn't figure out how to put more than one file in a torrent, and so fucked up the image by putting a new directory on it, containing the crack.

This crack is now obsolete, and if it was not on there, you would be able to use the image by disabling (in device manager) your IDE drives when you want to play the game.

But, the aforementioned retarded gimp has made it so you can't do that, meaning you cannot update to the latest patch, because there is not yet a crack for it, and so have a buggy version which is useless for multiplayer.

RELOADED, whoever you are, stop putting directories onto images, and learn how to make multiple file torrents if you really want to include an unnecessary crack.

Right, I'm off to eMule to download a version off someone who knows what they're doing."
,loymo,2007-10-28T02:26Z,"a quik tip for any noobs that struggle follow the advice given, the games install directory can be found in program files and cracks can be accessed by mounting the game then open my computer and explore cd have a nice day  "
,I Spel Good,2008-01-06T01:15Z,"note to n00bs:

,Maceus,2008-09-17T01:33Z,"I'd like to point out that on most games and warez (ie ones without advanced security), it does not make a difference whether or not a crack directory is included in the image. Maybe this is one of those, i don't know since i haven't downloaded it yet, but one might wonder why nobody else is having a problem with it"
,Hyorr,2008-10-19T18:56Z,"It keeps asking to reinstall the original game, but the game is already working (I tryed to reinstall and nothing changed) =/
