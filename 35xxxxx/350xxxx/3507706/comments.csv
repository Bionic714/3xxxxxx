[V],Krisiun,2006-08-01T00:46Z,"Awesome upload, awsome album!! Thx!"
,larsral,2006-08-01T11:05Z,"I believe the album will come with an optional t-shirt, if you pay a little more. And we now see the same thing happening with other bands: they are forced to tempt us into buying the album, and donÂ´t just DL it. Look at the new Tool cover, the neew KMFDM album, wich altso came with a t-shirt. So by downloading music, we are improving the products that we can buy!
Ha ha ha ha!"
,Peace Tank,2006-08-02T20:34Z,"Thank you so much man

I'll be sure to buy it as well"
,assassinmonk,2006-08-03T04:25Z,Thanks for the upload.  The new one sounds great - i'll definitely give the band my money!  Everyone should see them on tour now......

,ironfist22se,2006-08-10T18:24Z,"Remember:Buy the album fuckers!!!!!!
They deserve it more than anyone.

SLAAAAYYEER Fucking Rules!!!"
,Jagvillhaenlegohaest,2006-08-13T13:24Z,"They get like 5 dollars to share for each album you buy. Instead you go and see a concert and buy a damn t-shirt.

Thats how a real supporter thinks..
Thanks for the album
SLAYER"
