These are the best I could find.

#80 has a smallish file size & is not as clear as the others but actually looks ok.
#76, 77 & 78 'open small' but when magnified 2-3 times to fill the page look very good. The file size / resolution reflect this.

What I mean is, all are scanned nicely, really clear. 
They open and scroll well - some I came accross didn't. 
They open to fill the full window of Acrobat or Foxit - others didn't.

They are all full issues - they are not articles/sections taken from various issues.
