,Markmusen81,2006-08-20T18:03Z,I am soooo glad I didn't buy this CD. Terrible songs. Perhaps they're better if you have seen the movie... 
,monkeyboyzero,2006-08-21T07:48Z,"Great album if you like lounge/electronica better if you saw the movie, but honestly, if you like this style of music it holds its own as an album"

,slickafitta,2006-08-30T17:37Z,"Hej
Varför är inte JAY-Z encore med Linking Park inte med? Det är ju absolut första man hör i filmen men den finns inte med i albummet? konstigt.

Hello
Why isnt JAY-Z encore feat linking Park in the album soundtrack? That sound is the very first thing you hear and the song is not in the album soundtrack? Dont you find it strange?"
,p0lec4t,2006-09-25T18:38Z,"JAY-Z encore feat linking Park is not there cuz they probably want to sell more of their own album with the help of that song...

Anywayz, Michael Mann's music taste owns... "

,Avaran,2008-02-13T22:42Z,"Some of these songs are brilliant, then again, if you were looking for ""songs"" simply because you thought Miami Vice would sport something you can play at your average party, you can skip downloading this soundtrack.

'Mogwai - Auto rock' is an elegant piece,
Timbaland sampled ""Felix The Housecat"" and one of India Arie's best songs is ""Ready for Love""."
