,belga1,2006-07-31T06:19Z,I had no requested this particular one...but I tell you thank you very much for upload it.
,belga1,2006-07-31T07:08Z,"LOL...this crack again......
Dunno if you read regulary here...but it's renowed this crack system no work good for all....I'm in the non work batch ROF....
NOTA...I don't send you a PM..lol..as it's useless...lol."
,belga1,2006-07-31T07:49Z,"As I read CAREFULLY your instructions (it's your release isn'it?)..I see already a trivial error...as you write to D/L the crack program..and after you write to open the dash installer...but never you tell to run the crack proggy....
So if I  read and follow your famous instructions..I go really nowhere..ROFL...seem's for me amateurism...at least....
I installed the plane on the PC..of my grandmother and he run very good...but not on mine..bizzare isn't it...lol.
So 9 on your side..and 1 of my grandmother=10 good installs..."
,LOgo55,2006-07-31T11:08Z,"I folow the instructions and crack this one without any problem in 2min.And i am a beginner .

Anyway Vol-com thanks for this one very interesting."
,belga1,2006-07-31T15:05Z,"hello Logo,
the problem is not to follow instructions...or apply the crack..it's really a child play..the prob is this crack no work on ALL the machines....
No doubt it must certainly depend of what soft or system you use...all PC's are differents despite maybe they use the same OS...!"
,belga1,2006-07-31T15:08Z,"read just the comments here in a former torrent!!!

,belga1,2006-07-31T17:50Z,"Hello mate,

You will be astonished if you have a idea of my knowledge in PC....and IT.
Your seem's low as you don't understand it's possible the soft used for crack..may work for some and for others not.
And this is nothingg to do with new or old PC..etc...
Think about :)"
