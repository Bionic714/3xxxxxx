,Falleen_Fan_No_1,2007-12-15T05:17Z,This is only the C version as far as i know.  Does anybody know where to find the books in Bb?
,erix66,2008-10-29T05:10Z,"WOW!
this is a great upload. I learned alot about how to play jazz from some of these books and from band in a box. to have all of them is a treat! thanx."
,Dorothee,2008-12-12T15:39Z,"is this just the mp3s or is it the notes?!
Omg."
[T],L_Hammond,2008-12-30T03:24Z,"@Dorothee.
MP3's and booklets (text and sheet music). Sheet music only in 'C' (and not transposed to Bb or Eb) as Falleen_Fan wrote in an earlier comment."
,saekla,2009-04-26T18:58Z,"I'm not sure, but at least a few of the audio files seem to be mono. When I move faders to the right channel, all I get is silence instead of the cool instrument subtraction effect intended. Could possibly be the way I'm set up, but it doesn't seem to be."

,keibafan,2011-03-29T14:09Z,I'm seeding it all now from this workaround. Thanks L_Hammond.

[T],L_Hammond,2012-06-13T17:42Z,"PS. Should probably have written this a long time ago, but better late than sorry:

If you encounter errors during the file sharing, please, place this material as close to the root of the hard disk as possible and restart the file sharing (e.g. as close as possible to C: in Windows). This is in order to make the path (drive, directory and filename) as short as possible. Operating systems have limits regarding how long a path including the filename can be, and if this limit is exceeded there will be errors."
,ozfrog,2012-07-19T09:43Z,I have been looking for Eb and Bb sheets too for a long time. I cannot fathom how ALL volumes have had these deleted before kind people have uploaded - they are normally part & parcel of the original .pdf (s) - Sigh
