,kedq,2006-07-08T18:08Z,Some seeding would be most appreciated!
,Joshatdot,2006-07-09T10:58Z,"Sorry for the SLOW seeding...but my DSL is 384 up.  I am away for the weekend, and I cannot VNC to my desktop to check my Client."
,Joshatdot,2006-07-09T11:06Z,"VNC worked...really slow...so my connection is UP, but very slow...18 connections max upload 38KB/s"
,kedq,2006-07-09T19:37Z,Oh well we're all getting there :)
[T],DasBot,2006-07-10T21:26Z,Why include both the splitted and unsplitted AVI files?
,Joshatdot,2006-07-10T22:24Z,"Why...why not?  I like to watch a movie straight thru and not ""load"" CD2, thats why I offered both Split and single file.  Plus with clients these days you can choose not to DL the single file.

ps - Seems that my Router went alzheimer's on me, I am up and seeding again (8 connections @ 38KB/s now, instead of 18@38KB)"
,Joshatdot,2006-07-11T06:53Z,Woot! finally its being seeded by others! I thank you all for the patience you have shown me and my slow DSL upload speed.
,kedq,2006-07-11T23:07Z,Thanks to you too :)
,kedq,2006-07-11T23:08Z,But I did manage to upload 12GB before I was done downloading :o)
,TheOldBoo,2006-08-21T19:47Z,Please cane somebody help me!! i may sound like a noob now but i dont now how to open any downloaded from piratebay!! When i go to the download folder and click to open it doesnt work!! HELP!!
,LzyRob,2006-10-08T06:46Z,"After checking all the torrent sites I knew of, I finally find one that works (Although it's an extra gig compared to the others I've seen...)

I'll be sure to seed to at least 3.0 

Thanks :)"
,Joshatdot,2006-10-17T11:21Z,"Its an extra gig, cause I included 2x700mb files and one 1.4gb file, so you have the while movie in one file."
,The Sharing Master,2007-01-02T11:22Z,"i dont understand why you have two films!
 i downloaded cd1 and cd2 but there was'nt any picture!"
,DJ_Micke666,2007-01-02T11:53Z,"Stäng av eran satans limiters. Ni behöver ju inte gränsa nerladdningen när ni seedar. *Gäsp

Turn off your freaking limters. You don't have to limit your uploads. *Yawn"
,The Sharing Master,2007-01-05T12:14Z,Its no fucking picture your idiot!
,xXHustlerXx,2007-02-02T08:42Z,"Seeda! Det gör INTE din nerladdning ""slow"" Du får mer ratio (om du använder azureus) Och det skadar dig INTE!!! Kom igen Seeda Så går det snabbt!"
,Joshatdot,2007-02-06T12:15Z,"HDD crashed & lost all data. I have it backed up on DVD-R somewhere, I'll try and seed it again after I find that backup."
,T.U.P.N.,2007-03-28T19:11Z,I can't seem to get the audio to play. Can anyone help? I'd appreciate it.
