And you say I have to pay for a program to convert it to good old-fashioned mp3?

Ikke god stil... ;)"
,zeeco,2006-07-27T11:17Z,yeah.. kill flac!!  :P
,reine12,2007-06-15T21:44Z,"Go f**k yourself idiots! FLAC is the way to distribute 
high quality music. Amateurs! Keep on the good work!!!!"
,Deadend_deadend,2008-04-10T08:45Z,"Yeah, FLAC is fantastic; as has already been said, download any free decoder you want, convert to WAV. Then you have pure files you can burn to CD, convert to MP3 at any bitrate you want, or what have you. It takes all of a minute to convert, and then you have all the flexibility in the world...so thanks to the original seeder, and get a clue to the detractors.

D-D"

,Drystonius,2009-07-28T08:13Z,amen
,jwheazy,2009-10-09T20:08Z,"FLAC is a lossless file morons....  if you want an MP3 then use GOOGLE and learn how to convert it.

Flac should be the ONLY way to share music, then if you want to downgrade the music quality to save space you can do that.  it takes less than 2 mins to convert an entire album into MP3 320,192, 128, etc"

Go educate yourself before exposing your ignorance to the world.
Have a nice next life as an ant."
