,ManiKatti,2007-07-27T03:43Z,"@unknown_93: Your a pretty stupid person... Have you never heard of .zip files? They more common then .rar files. The only reason you see mostly .rar files here are because it costs to buy .zip programs. Anyways, back to the point. Don't rename the .zip file to .iso. The .iso file is INSIDE the .zip file. If you have a recent version of WinRAR, just open the .zip file with that and extract it normally.

@gamerz1993: Try Google before asking a dumb question like this."

Your high. Zip programs are far more common than rar files because zip programs are usually free.

Hell, windows will even extract zip files without additional software - and had been able to since xp i think."
