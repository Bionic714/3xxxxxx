,East Lansing,2008-02-23T05:52Z,"Many of the biggies, like ROMs for Galaga, DigDug, Defender, etc are not working with this version of MAME.  I don't know what happened to Pac Man, it's not even listed under ""all games"" any more.  (Pac&Pal, Pac Land are).  
With each new release of the MAME program, fewer and fewer ROMs work!
I was hoping to download a full pack of working ROMS for this version but I just wasted my time."
,A9k,2009-01-03T21:58Z,"Waste of time, most of the ROMs don't work.  Don't bother DLing."

Most likely you have re-configured the ""UI Configure"" key, normally Tab, to something else. To restore the default settings, the quickest way is to delete the default.cfg file from the cfg/ subdirectory below the main MAME directory. However this will remove any other general input changes, too.

If you have settings you don't want to lose, you can also edit default.cfg with any text editor, since the input configuration files are in XML format. Open the default.cfg file and find the line that says . Delete that line and all the lines down to and including the next  line; this should be five lines. Save the file. "
,sahib071,2011-11-01T18:00Z,I have no snp shot of these games if any one have so kindly mail me sahib_071@yahoo.com or upload at any host site plzzzzzzzzzz
