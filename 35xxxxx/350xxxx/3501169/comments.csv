,Ced,2006-07-06T18:17Z,"And what is this, leftovers..? B-sides...?"
,zolle66,2006-07-09T16:24Z,gurkhat...a good 128 kb rip is far better than a bad 320... there are too many lousy 320 rips out here...

,Yedo,2006-07-20T00:53Z,"Fuck you, honestly. Crest of Waves, the first track off that ""2006 album"" is a b-side, nothing else. As there has been absolutely NO information about Coldplay releasing any material right now, this ""release"" is highly doubtful."
,fhs999,2006-07-21T15:20Z,128kbps can sound better than this. thanks anyways
,saraslave,2012-03-16T22:58Z,"This is a Fan Album, a Famous one, a lot of work was put into the the Album Cover, releasing it.

This is actually one of my favorite Coldplay albums.

Way to go, thank you for uploading it."
