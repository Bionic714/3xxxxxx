,vermi undead,2006-07-30T14:45Z,tell me some more about the game....
,Son Of Mogh,2006-07-30T19:13Z,"thnx for the up, giants citizen, is this the original fallen lords from 1997? I will download it if it is that one!"
,Son Of Mogh,2006-07-30T19:21Z,"heck no, it is not from 1997, it is fallen lords condemnation from 2006. "
,Son Of Mogh,2006-07-30T19:21Z,Does someone know the system requirements for this game? 
,Sinnersfury,2006-08-01T16:45Z,"You know, it would've been nice to know it was in italian BEFORE I downloaded it?!?"
,TRONisLAW,2006-08-02T04:06Z,go to the data folder then base and copy the messages file from the Uk folder and past in into the italian folder to switch most of the ingame and menu messages to english. Post if anyone else can figure out how to get the rest into english
,ironwolf56,2006-08-03T07:04Z,Also go into data then ui and copy the xml from uk and paste to it as well (just that one; it uses the same other files).  That seems to clear up a lot of the other Italian text and makes it English.
,ironwolf56,2006-08-03T08:17Z,I gotta say this game's kinda frustrating so far.  When I open a tutorial I'd appreciate help with game commands and the game not making me face a guy that's 4 times as powerful and fast as me before I can do anything else.
,mikac87,2006-10-02T16:21Z,"you can do the same thing with the data/levels, but you have to go through each level's folder and copy uk messages file to it folder and each then everything will be in english"
,jasonan,2006-10-03T15:31Z,"just go to data folder and then edit config.xml->change locale=""It"" to locale=""UK"". english then"
,IlluSioN`isT,2006-10-19T01:12Z,Seed plz :>
