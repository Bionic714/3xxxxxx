Just thought I'd put this online for other Cale fans to enjoy. Sorry about the format, havn't got the energy to encode it properly atm. and since it's an mce recording it suffers some interlace problems. It's still pretty good, and audio is good. If someone wants to recode it be my guest.

I won't seed forever, keep your download running after it's finished so others can enjoy aswell.
