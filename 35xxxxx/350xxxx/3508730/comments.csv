,thezig,2006-07-31T15:21Z,"I should also say that the tracker and/or my client is borked, and the whole thing is being seeded (by me) whether the page says so or not."
,qolko,2006-08-03T23:44Z,"while extracting i got some errors dont know what they were but there were like over 10 of them,i used latest version of winrar."
,thezig,2006-08-04T18:58Z,"It's ok. they were probably path length errors. there's a few files with ridiculously long path names, and this can cause errors, but the few files with those long names aren't important anyway."
,Weendigo123,2006-09-17T00:07Z,"to solve the path length problem, you can unrar it in the root of you hdd and then move the folder."
,JeffPaine,2007-07-09T17:54Z,"Man, I love you, I made an archive of the site when they first announced they were closing, but that hard drive died on me. "
,claws61821,2007-10-09T19:01Z,"You are awesome.  I was originally going to d/l this from the site when it was first made, but then Soni's hosts said they were going to take over for him.  Obviously we all know how that turned out...I've been looking for a tracker with it ever since."

you couldnt have cleaned that damn thing up first? i've gone through about 70 of the almost 600 folders and most was links to pictures that arent there anymore or the fucking buttons of a website and other website things, i might just say fuck it and delete it all, i dont think it'll be worth going through"
