,kommevalla,2006-07-14T00:02Z,My first torrent. I had big problem with upload because my ISP is blocking that function and nothing happend when pressing the upload button (except a timeout). I found a work around with the software Torpark. For more information check http://torpark.nfshost.com/index.html
,p5050,2006-07-14T08:41Z,"Is this,in some way,related to the movie ""The World's Fastest Indian""?"
,kommevalla,2006-07-14T09:32Z,"No it's not, this is from the early 1990 about a guy building a motorcycle from scratch of his own and takes it to Daytona and beats the factory racing team. This is a documentary movie about the building and racing of the Britten bikes. Check out this for more information http://www.britten.co.nz/ . First time I watched this movie I almost got tears in my eyes when I realized that this guy died a few years after this movie."

,hostage66,2007-11-22T04:18Z,"This is a must see for all motorsports fans, especially bike enthusiasts.
The bike also featured in Discovery channels documentary ""Greatest Motorcycles Ever Made"".
John Britten was a true innovator and visionary. He was an incredible man who built an awesome bike from scratch that beat the worlds best factory superbikes and proved that if you are passionate about something anything is possible.
Very inspirational and...., Ok I'll stop there, just watch it yourself and you'll see what I mean.
Stay upright!"
