GREAT post!  Thanks!

However, I believe I have problem with media for Left Behind III.  I and II play just fine on my DVD player, I've burnt 4 or 5 # IIIs to disc, all with same results - DVD goes into play mode, and nothing further - no audio, no video.

I went back and tried II again, to see if my DVD player had miracle timing, and just died on me - not the case, II plays just fine again...

And...  disc III plays just fine on computer under Kaffeine (I run Linux computers, mostly), burned DVD using K3B.

Very mysterious, and I suspect DVD content is a media format not supported by my DVD player now (JVC XV-N412S).

Content of discs looks quite similar with proper file content types, but disc III just flat does not play on my DVD player, where it does computer.

Any chance I can beg you to re-rip III and reup just that ISO?

Next step, I'll try ripping DVD to .avi or mpg, and then convert content to an ISO image I can burn back to DVD.  many steps, but I'll see what I can do.

Thanks,

-Pat"

,Esmad3,2009-06-08T14:48Z,Notice that all bucky katt's uploads r from 2006. That's because god stroke him down for dicking around with his holy works. Now he's in hell but thats ok. All part of the great design.
[T],TalmudTimmy,2010-03-26T07:35Z,The Left Behind premise is completely Biblically inaccurate. 
[V],maestral,2010-08-16T01:16Z,"Thank you. Great series. I loved first part, and eager to see those other 2 :D cheers"
