Stream Of Passion - "Embrace The Storm"(2005)

"..."Embrace the Storm" serves up twelve remarkable tracks in a Gothic Metal vein, and although the progressive instincts of many of the musicians has largely been repressed, there is still enough complexity in the music to keep Ayreon fans very happy indeed. In the meantime it is exciting to witness Lucassen turning his hand to a genre being made so popular by the likes of Within Temptation and Nightwish, and becoming an instant match for them."

"...While much of "Embrace the Storm" is an intense listening experience, and as such requires repeated spins for the songs to reveal their real treasures, there can be no doubt that this is a remarkable album."
