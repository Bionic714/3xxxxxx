Fast, easy to use, PC speed testing and benchmarking. PassMark 
PerformanceTest ? allows you to objectively benchmark a PC using a variety 
of 
different speed tests and compare the results to other computers.

Find out if your PC is performing at its best. 
Compare the performance of your machine to similar machines. 
Measure the effect of configuration changes and upgrades. 
Avoid paying big bucks for poor performance. 
Make objective independent measurements on which to base your
purchasing decision. Versions:

PassMark Rating and comparable baselines
In addition to the standard tests, there are 7 summary results plus the 
overall "PassMark Rating" result. The benchmark results are presented as 
easy 
to read bar charts so that you don't need to spend hours studying the number 

to know the result. Timing for the tests is done using high resolution 
timers, which are accurate to approximately 1 millionth of a second on most 
PC's.

A major advantage is the support for built-in baseline results which allows 
you to compare computer systems (a baseline is a standard set of results 
from 
another computer). These baseline results can be used to determine how fast 
your computer is in comparison with other computer systems.

The evaluation version of PerformanceTest contains the baseline results from 

seven different computer systems. After the software is purchased the user 
can access PassMark's database of baseline results where many other 
benchmark 
results can be downloaded.
