Flashing your drive
-------------------
*  This application automatically makes a backup of your firmware and asks for save
   location.
** Make sure you are flashing over an ORIGINAL image on your drive, if needed first
   do a RESTORE.  Undesired results can be achieved if you flash over a previously
   flashed image.

- Plug SATA cable from DVD drive to PC
- Power cable drive still connected to Xbox 360
- Ensure drive is in mode b either by two wire trick or slax linux boot cd
- Go to Windows
- Run hitachiflash.exe and if the drive is properly connected it should get detected
- Choose the Action: "Patch your firmware with xtreme 1.2"
- Hit go and wait, 
- There will be a prompt asking where you want to place the backup of the original
  firmware (before patching)
- The flash must start, if some "retry" windows appears hit YES/OUI until finished
- At the end the application will check for 100% so you can shut down the system

Thats all


Restoring your drive (Requires previously saved Firmware Image)
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Plug SATA cable from DVD drive to PC
- Power cable drive still connected to Xbox 360
- Ensure drive is in mode b either by two wire trick or slax linux boot cd or if you
  have the Xtreme 1.2 then use the TWEAK starting the box with the tray opened
- Go to Windows

- Choose the Action: "Restore Original firmware"
- Hit go and wait, 
- There will be a prompt asking for your original UNENCRYPTED image
