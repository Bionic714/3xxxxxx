,gsbd41316,2006-07-18T04:06Z,"lotpot, parallels desktop is like a Virtual PC clone but for Intel Macs and its said to be faster and better"
,lotpot,2006-07-18T04:21Z,"Ok, tnx :)"
,lotpot,2006-07-18T04:23Z,"Works like a applicationserver then? 
You work on your own desktop from anothe machine?"
,zka.kisochra,2006-07-18T05:54Z,"Parallels simulates another machine from within OSx.  You can allocate system resources to the VM and treat it like any other pc (with some limitations), which allows you to use most operating systems from within osx."

,zka.kisochra,2006-07-20T01:25Z,Copy and pasting the key directly into the text box does not work. you must delete the dashes inbetween the groups of numbers for it to fit.  The username is:  akram
