But, this movie is just shit... 

I can't believe I wasted 2.5 hours watching it.

Whomever cast Brandon Routh as The Man of 
Steel was either a relative of his, pressured to 
do it by a relative of his or just plain retarded."

,skypemaster,2006-07-22T17:12Z,"I had previously downloaded and watched Superman.Returns.TELESYNC.NTSC.DVDR-KDi from here...

http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3501595

But grabbed this in the hope of finding a better copy. Unfortunately this is also a Camcorder job too. Please do not think I am complaining, I am not the type, simply trying to let others know that this is another poor quality superman movie. Will continue to seed both movies until something better comes along."

dude, what the fuck did you expect? your are a fuckin prick, and i dont think you even understand how much work it is to make a fuckin copy of a movie. if you dont like it, go do it yourself jackass. 

(movie was bad though... glad i didnt pay for it :)




very well said"
,nyssa_temp,2006-09-13T22:25Z,"Why are people so agrivated over bad quality? Any reasonably gifted youngster should be able to figure out, that the movies You download has to have been released on DVD in order to rip them in decent quality.

If the movie is NOT out on DVD, like Superman Returns, You´ll get a cam-version, like this one, and they always suck. So why the abrupt surprise? You know its not out on DVD yet, so dont even bother downloading it, unless You´re content with cam-versions, which, judged on Your  recent outburst, You´re not.

If You want in-theater movies, just pay the fuckin fee, and go see it! "
,m_lekruse,2006-09-14T17:51Z,can someon plz seed??
,TheGrimReaper,2006-09-19T14:21Z,"I just got to say something to defend those who says that we shouldnt download this because of the quality. Well... EVEN IT THERE ARENT A DVD OUT YET!! The dvd can still have gotten out from the company that made the movie. That happens a lot. So if we all wait for a better release, we will get a good movie. Why are there so many dickheads on piratebay? Just dont complain. If you have downloaded something and thinks that it was a waste of time, then dont waste more time on it and make a stupid coment. =S Lika if one have said that this movie has bad quality, why does everone else also have to say it? It just makes it... more difficult for everyone else."
,Re-spect,2006-09-19T20:56Z,"Asså, jag har en fråga...och det är hur ser man på en film som har formaten bin/ cue ? :S vet inte..är lite newbie på den delen .. tack på förhand..."
,kifa,2006-09-23T13:22Z,"hello ..

Thanks :) "
,scotham,2006-09-30T04:44Z,Thanx
,kiboerre,2006-09-30T11:16Z,seeding pleas?
,xhanatos,2006-10-23T02:24Z,"do not download. bad quality!! however, thanks for the upload gas1can."
,SgtPsycho,2006-10-24T10:34Z,"It only makes sense to include the quality in the description, that way everyone knows what they're getting and aren't disappointed.

Without a qualification of the capture source, some people will grab it anyway just to check it out.  In this case a sample would help and prevent wasted bandwidth (hit/run).

Nyssa_temp, you never know when an elite release will be made.  An excellent quality TS (remember  The Two Towers?) could turn up at any time, as could a TC.  A bit early for dvdscreener (__not__ rip) but we can hope.

Respect to the seeders keeping it going."
,cidric_be,2006-11-15T23:48Z,Omg this is soooooo bad quality... Why the hell did't i download this..
