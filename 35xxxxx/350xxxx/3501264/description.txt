Dreamscenery's KIND Lite. Original read me from FSAddict:



One of the worst sceneries ive ever installed. DreamScenery, more like NightmareScenery!

Ok, heres what i did to make it acceptable.

I yanked out all the green birdshit photosceneries, 003100233133013Fa for example, about 500 of them, in the C:\.....\Flight Simulator 9\Indianapolis2005 Lite\texture

and then i renamed like .bgl to OLD the files, pin_1_4_su thru pin_22_23_asu in the C:\........\Flight Simulator 9\Indianapolis2005 Lite\scenery about 4 of them.

also you have to add this crapola to FS9, not automatic.


happy flying

ohh DreamScenery.....blow me
