,extrudedplasticdingus,2006-07-20T16:17Z,Brilliant film that I would download if seeded.
,jgabriel,2006-07-20T21:07Z,"I know, same here. It really would be nice if someone seeded this film, like, say, the person who uploaded the torrent....

Looks like there's another 16 people also eager to download this film. Unfortunately, they're all still at 0%, several *hours* after this torrent was uploaded.

Guess we'll just have to wait for someone who isn't a tease to upload it for us.

,traveler78,2006-07-21T23:50Z,"Sorry about that guys, I'm quite new to the bitTorrent thing (downloaded Azureus 2 days ago). I chose to ""open the torrent for seeding""  when I created it in Azureus. If I choose to open the torrent in Azureus is says that it has already been added. Is there anything else I need to do?

However, I also have great difficulty with NAT problems even after following the advice on ""NAT problem"" on AzureusWiki. Do you have any suggestions where to get good advice, or maybe I should use another client? Thankful for advice."

,activist,2007-08-05T19:26Z,seed? :(
,krakowz,2008-01-07T17:02Z,"Hey guys can you please seed, im stuck at 99.9 % i know it sounds odd but i acctually am =/ so can someone please seed for a halfhour or so ? "
,dilbertgeg,2008-08-12T04:52Z,"This is the one stuck at 99.9% for me.
I started dl'ing another version!
I ran it through AVIDEMUX and re-indexed it.  At about 43 minutes (a red line is about halfway in the download), there is a moment where the audio skips a few words and the picture freezes and mucks up for about 6 seconds.  Then it resumes but the sound is lagging.  If I cared, I could probably learn how to split it at about 44 minutes and repair the audio delay.

Maybe that's helpful to someone on Dialup."
