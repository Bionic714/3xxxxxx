,AlexanderLindstrom,2006-07-20T09:36Z,"Eh, How are we suppose to burn this if it's bigger than a DVD? :P Someone please upload season 6 and 7 soon. :)"
[V],goja,2006-07-20T12:44Z,Burn it on a dual layer disc and it will work out just fine.

,eKi100,2007-02-01T22:13Z,"Goja, R u dumb or something??
These fucking asswipes NEVER SEED when theyre finished dl... I just hope, that someday soon, comes out client, wich does not dl, if u do not seed & so it would dl only on same rate as ur seeding.. Thats the way to kill those leecher-fuckers in ""torrent-world"".."
,eKi100,2007-02-01T22:15Z,"& goja, other thing...
U must be dumb as hell..!!
""burn it on dual layer disk"", u have any idea how much dl disks costs?? I would not have to spend much more, to get whole season on ORIGINAL, so never gonna burn it on dl disk, u noobass!! Rather i would make those files bit smaller & it fits on normal dvd, & minimizing those does not mean that quality gets any worster... Buy brains, not dual layer disk!"
