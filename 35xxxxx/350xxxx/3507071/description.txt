Synopsis

Marlon Brando triumphs in his first starring role in ten years as Carmine Sabatini, a powerful New York importer. Matthew Broderick co-stars as Clark Kellogg, a naive film student who accepts a job working for Sabatini. As if trapped in a comic nightmare, Clark finds himself drawn deeper and deeper into an ingenious scam involving an endangered Komodo Dragon, Sabatinis daughter, Bert Parks and a group of very hungry eccentrics. But when the FBI asks Clark to snitch on his colorful employer, he discovers a strange loyalty to this fatherly figure. Written and directed by Andrew Bergman, creator of The Inlaws, THE FRESHMAN is "clever, creative, charming with intelligent twists" ?Dixie Whatley, AT THE MOVIES.
