,w000ter,2006-07-25T00:20Z,"bingo, israel has the sense to put their nutters in prison. the arabs...they just let them run amuck and egg them on. and then complain about why theres no peace:P"
,p2P2p,2006-07-25T06:53Z,"I must say I find your comments disappointingly reactionary and more than a little offensive.

This documentary is from the time of Ariel Sharon and looks into far-right millitant Jewish radicals. I'm sorry if you feel this film from 2005 is one-sided, it has been shared here for information. The filmmaker Dan Setton makes it pretty clear that... quote: ""I was never sympathetic to their ideas or their actions. I was never sympathetic on the ideological level. I'm not sympathetic to somebody who believes in revenge as a virtue, even though I can understand it in some cases."" He answers further questions about the film here:
http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/israel/etc/setton.html

He and his crew took on this project after completing a film called ""In The Name of God: Scenes from the Extreme"" about radical Islamists (HBO, 2003). It was a journey into the most radical communities in Pakistan, Afghanistan and South Lebanon... quote: ""Every religion has its extremists...""

Peace."
,tomtomx,2006-07-25T23:07Z,@ p2P2p: Don't know if that comment was intended for all of us. I never intended anything else that to comment the way Israel fights extremists as opposed to some of the surrounding countries being ruled by extremists. I live in Sweden. Here the media and government has always been extremely pro-arab no matter what the circumstances are.
,p2P2p,2006-07-26T05:34Z,"Hi there tomtomx, no it was more the first persons comments I was refering to and although I am not an Arab or Jewish, I still find the comments offensive. I am also sure that you know much more than me about the Swedish media, but hope that you are wise enough to see through their cynicism :o) Thank you for your response....

,inachu,2007-04-21T00:52Z,"This video pretty much says the truth of the neocons.  small minority of people who have the say in USA just because they give lots of money in donations and pac funds and such so we listen to them but once we do then they place no blame on themselves if things go wrong.  
Typical neocon accepts no responsibility in anything.   then they have passive surveilance by using dead sea creme booth in mall across USA just like ZOOM COPTERS did.   Neocons use and abuse the system....  we need to nuke them all"
,robbieirish,2010-11-05T04:21Z,"Far extremist group? isn't this the Israeli government? I laugh at some of the comments here pre 2009 genocide. I wonder if the  sympathizers for Israel have had a change of tune. doubt it, criminals never change so why should evil thoughts. "
