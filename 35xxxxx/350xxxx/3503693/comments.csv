,ockizzz,2006-07-18T17:37Z,"How do a listen to cue file music? 

It is crap when the music stick together. 

Help Pls"
,Valar-Morghulis,2006-07-19T19:45Z,"CUE files are the cd image, you open them in nero, and wait a few minutes, nero will usually show ""not responding"" but it is fine, just wait a like 10 mins for it to load, and then you can burn a virtual duplicate of the original"
,Valar-Morghulis,2006-07-19T19:47Z,"Hardstyle is technically Hard House, some of the Italian records and Blutonium from germany have strong trance influences, but the main artists like Zany, Prophet, Technoboy, Showtek, are hard house!"
,somicke,2006-07-22T13:32Z,"burn the cue file with Isomagic insted of nero, its an img file and the music wont stick together ,Good luck"
