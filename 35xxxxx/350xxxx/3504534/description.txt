Petsel's DS9 S4D4.
I am not seeding this currently but will later if the need arises. I see 1 Seed and 2 Leechers.

Of the DVDs I have inspected so far, the following of petsel's releases would benefit from a seed:
DS9 S1D1

DS9 S1D5   
http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3312900

All the rest of the S1 torrents are managing well so far.

I have just received DS9 S4D5. There's one seed. Posting it after this.
Firbie who supplied the torrent asked if there was anyone who has the S7D7 .torrent file for the Star Trek Voyager series that is available on The Pirate Bay. Anyone?
