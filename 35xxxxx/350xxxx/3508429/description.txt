Setting up the WebUI
---------------------
Make sure that you're using the current beta, which should 1.5.1 build 460 (latest as of
writing). If you do not have this build you can always get it from uTorrent's download
page. (http://utorrent.com/download.php)

Place the webui.zip file in the folder which contains the settings.dat file; this is a must.
Most likely this will be your %AppData%\uTorrent folder (default location). 
(Type %AppData%\uTorrent into the run box and hit enter).
DO NOT EXTRACT the zip, uTorrent uses the zip file itself.

The settings for the WebUI are nested under "General" in the Preferences (Ctrl + P).
If you expand the "General" section you should see "Web UI;" just click on it and the
settings for the WebUI will automagically appear. Obviously you'll have to enable
the WebUI and then you can set a username and password to secure the WebUI a bit.
If you'd like you can also enable the guest account, but this is not recommended at
this point, because the html UI isn't really made for a guest account. There is no 
password for the guest account (duh!?). If you'd prefer the WebUI to be accessed on
a different port than uTorrent is using you can set that under "Connectivity." In addition
to changing the port, you can also restrict access to a list of IPs.

Accessing the WebUI
---------------------
The URL format is this: 
http://Username:Password@YourIP:UTport/gui/index.html

Make sure you follow that exact format or it won't work. Remember that you cannot use
username:password in the URL when using Internet Explorer.

Changelog
------------------

Notes:
- [Opera] Right-clicking and key shortcuts are not working correctly; these are Opera bugs
  and a bug reprt has been filed.
- [Safari/Konqueror] The text in the torrent list seems to display off-centre.
- Shortcuts:
	Delete: Removes selected torrent(s)
	Ctrl + A: Select all torrents
	Ctrl + Space: Deselect all torrents
	Ctrl + O: Show the form for adding a torrent
	Ctrl + P: Show the settings window
	F2: Show the about window
	F4: Hide/show the toolbar
	F7: Hide/show the category list
- At the moment there is no tertiary sorting being done, so if you secondary sort a column
  that has like values the items will randomly switch at each update
- If you have allot of items on your list it will use allot of CPU power (obviously trying
  to reduce it).
