The Ultimate Sid Meier Collection is a fan-assembled compendium of 35 Sid Meier games, and it fits on one DVD!  It does not include every single game that Sid ever worked on, but it's damn near close.  It doesn't include Civilization IV, but that's because that game is still very much for sale.  If you want Civ4, buy it, or find it somewhere else.
