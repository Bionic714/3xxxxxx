Cosmic Plan
=-=-=-=-=-=

Sixto Paz is one of the most famous contactees in the world and a required guest in the world√Üs most important international congresses on the UFO question. Similarly, he\'s been interviewed  by many radio and TV programs. He was able to establish contact with the UFOs and their crews in the 1970s and produced his vision for the Cosmic Plan over recent decades.

This DVD covers issues of evolution, UFO contact, Crop circles, ET communication at the infamous Chiltbolton site in the UK, Atlantis, Pleiadian genetic interuption, Sirian tribes, the New World Order, the bible and Christ, the Shining Ones and more. Much of the narrative and philosophy given in this presentation mirors that given to [so far un-debunked] Billy Meier and revealed in his videos and contact notes. Screw mainstream UFOology!

The video is contains  some excellent animations throughout the story told by Sixto. At the end of the main sequence is the DVD extra footage of some of Sixto\'s regular contacts/appearances of UFOs on video and stills.

RIP Notes:
=========

This DVD was reduced using DVD shrink. It\'s been tested in a standalone region free DVD player and Windows media player. It failed in my version of VLC player but that could just be my buggy version.
The video retains the original dual language format - select using local settings.
