,rafal61,2008-07-12T14:55Z,Glad to see that this torrent is still alive. After more than 2 years!
,jbert,2009-04-28T18:50Z,It's probably because the only other decent torrent is 12+ GiB.
,technosailor,2010-01-02T11:22Z,"WTF, this is only Season 2!"
,Synthesist,2010-01-03T21:58Z,"Don't know what the uploader was smoking bur, this is the ONLY season of this show."
,Synthesist,2010-01-03T22:04Z,"Thanks BTW to the uploader.. the sequel series to the original Battlestar Galactica is actually a fetid
pile of sh*t.. but, as a fan, it is of archival interest.

That said, I'm only taking eps. 1-3, 7-8 and 10 as the rest involve the Galactica kids with
""super powers"" in Earth's environment.  (Odd, Troy and Dillon don't seem to possess these abilities in the pilot.)"
,SmauG69,2010-03-31T05:41Z,Hail all ye seeders! I vow to reciprocate if I get all of this eventually! :)
,shane_m666,2011-12-09T21:27Z,"Thanx for the upload haven't seen this for 25 years or so. Took a day to download it but it was worth it. 
So i seeded it for a day
cheers rafal61"
,huggums537,2012-02-06T01:44Z,"To the idiots who think this is season 2 only: There were only 10 episodes and this is all of them. Sometimes this series is patched together with the original 1978 series when aired in some syndication packages. This is why the uploader refers to it as: ""BSG 1980 seria 2 (2x01-2x10)""

There was no season 2 of the original 1978 series and there was no season 2 of the 1980 series. Look it up on wikipedia people!"
