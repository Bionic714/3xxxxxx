
STARWARS: The Battle of Endor High Texture Pack
-------------------------------
Released: July 26,  2006

Install The Battle of Endor from http://www.bruneras.com/ to the default location on the c drive,  unpack the zip and copy 

the models and shaders folder over the originals.

This plays great on my 2.20 athlon with 1 gig of ram.

The far and close up models are the same and everything is retextured apart from the executor. All source models are included 

if you wish to play with them some more. 

Its not perfect but better than what is currently available, ie nothing. 

Feel free to improve on it!

Another great release from The Dark Judges! :)


May the force be with you!
