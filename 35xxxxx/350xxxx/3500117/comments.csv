,1strawn2bobas,2009-04-17T21:50Z,"The sub file is within the .srt file.  Make sure you download that file and use VLC player.  Choose video > subtitles > load > find the .srt file and you now have subs!

If you want to embed the subs into the video...googgle it or go to

There are a few things you need to download and run, but it isn't difficult.  So this torrent is fine, make sure you download everything.  And if you want One file instead of two it just takes a few more steps...
