This album is encoded with the "Monkey's audio lossless encoder". The file extension is *.ape . Once i had the decoder for "Monkey's" installed Winamp played it great, i suggest using the same. For burning i would use Poikosoft's Easy CD-DA Extractor, the reason for this is for one it is what i used to rip it with and for reason 2 is it also can burn it to cd for you. I tried using nero with the "Monkey's audio decoder nero plugin",  but it made nero unstable so i would not suggest this. Please i love to hear comments and i welcome them good or bad. Plus i will also warn you there is no album art sorry but there is a m3u file. Well last but not least please seed for at least a week as it hard to find good 80's music in Lossless format which was not re-recorded from previous downloaded files, this copy came from a pristine unscratched original cd. I liked all but 2 songs but even they didn't warrant skipping over!! Enjoy!!
