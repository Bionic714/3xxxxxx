,freelancerx,2006-07-09T14:10Z,this is amazing! my mate is going to freak out when i tell him about this torrent :)
,tazrepect,2006-07-09T19:50Z,"i know it is, it took me over a year to collect! ;-)"
,jasonderbby,2006-07-12T07:34Z,"Hey
Sorry guys, I feel like a total loser for asking. But how exactly do I get these to work on my N-Gage? Once again, sorry for the major noob question. I just got my N-Gage yesterday so I'm not to familiar with how it all works yet.
Thanks"
,tazrepect,2006-07-12T09:30Z,"hi first of all download + install WinRAR from her: 
http://files.rarlab.com/rar/wrar351.exe"
,tazrepect,2006-07-12T09:31Z,"2. now right click the game file you want to install and choose ""extract Here"""
,tazrepect,2006-07-12T09:33Z,"3. it will extract a folder called the game name e.g. a folder called ""bomberman"" open this folder and copy the ""system"" folder within this folder"
,tazrepect,2006-07-12T09:34Z,4. now you will need a an mmc card and a mmc car reader. go to your mmc card drive (in my computer) and open it
,tazrepect,2006-07-12T09:36Z,"5. now paste the system folder DIRECTLY onto the mmc card, it may ask you to replace the current ""system"" folder, choose yes (dont worry it wont delete anything)"
,tazrepect,2006-07-12T09:38Z,6. now put the mmc card into your n-gage and you will see a new game icon at the bottom of your n-gage menu!! click it and the game should work!!! enjoy ;-)
,jasonderbby,2006-07-12T16:39Z,"thanks man
is there any way to get multiple games on the card at one time? and then just choose which game I want to play?"
,tazrepect,2006-07-12T23:32Z,"yeah you just do the same thing again, i have several installed on a 1 gig mmc!"

,faisalm1991,2008-11-18T05:12Z,"What the hell, all of you people complaining that they don't work on nokia n95, n82, n81. 
of course they don't work, these are the n-gage games for the ORIGINAL N-gage device. they DO NOT WORK on the new second generation of N-gage. You have to look for n-gage 2.0 games some forums have them like dotsis.com"

i can just download an data. of 46 Kb.

please help me!!!

thanks Sven"
,Hezkore,2009-06-08T05:22Z,"It's really easy installing these games.

If they're RAR files with a System folder in them, just throw them directly onto your N-Gage memory card and replace the System folder already there (you need to have Show Hidden Files/Folders On)

If it's a SIS file, throw the SIS over to the N-Gage and use the built in installer application on the N-Gage.

All these games are for the original N-Gage and N-Gage QD.

And Sven, you probably just downloaded the Torrent file, you'll need to grab a Torrent Application to use the Torrent file, such as uTorrent."
