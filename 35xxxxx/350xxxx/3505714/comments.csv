That is the most sad part of our reality, that children often just parrot what they hear from their parents. And if the parents are ignorant the children will follow in those same ignorant footsteps."
,Temptation,2006-07-24T14:44Z,thanks for this.
,p2P2p,2006-07-25T07:07Z,Sorry about this one... seems like the language files have been merged and without the subs (congratulations to those who speak spanish!). I'll stick a proper eng version up when I get a chance. If anyone has a sub/srt for this vid pls post here. Thx
,tomtomx,2006-08-03T15:07Z,Sweetnucca. I assume you're talking about your parents. Sad...
,mahasamatman,2006-10-20T11:08Z,"everyone speaks spanish, and the spanish subtitles are engraved into the movie file. 
as soon as my download was complete... I deleted this film"
,snowden,2007-10-16T19:22Z,who's the idiot who posted this with spanish audio and didn't mention it in the title? what a waste... :(
,Mudget,2008-03-12T22:50Z,Please mention -somewhere- that this film is entirely in Spanish.
