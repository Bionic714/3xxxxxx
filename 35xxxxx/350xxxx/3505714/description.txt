Promises (2001)
==============

Several Jewish and Palestinian children are followed for three years and put in touch with each other, in this alternative look at the Jewish-Palestinian conflict. The three filmmakers followed a group of seven local children between 1995 and 1998. They all have a totally different background. These seven children tell their own story about growing up in Jerusalem. Through this portrait of their generation, we see how deep rooted and almost insoluble the problems of the Middle East have become. When the protagonists speak out in an epilogue a couple of years later, it becomes apparent that all have lost their childlike innocence.

7 children, 7 hates, 7 different lives, 7 possibilities, 1 meeting and 1 million chances to peace. "Promises" is a shiny and wonderful documentary about the conflicts between Israel and Palestine showed by children. It's extraordinary to see them talking about the conflicts: they repeat their parents' opinion until the director B.Z. suggests a meeting. Some agree; others no. And the great moment of "Promises" is their meeting, when they're just kids: playing, eating, laughing, talking, crying... That meeting waves to peace. It seems to be the solution adults don't want to see.
