Funny game that takes us back to CounterStrike 1.5, with it's classics maps like aztec, dust and office.. 

But we now got a new perspective on the game... In 2D !! (Overview)

The game has BOTS installed, and can also be played over LAN =P

==> EXTRACT all files from Winrar, and execute "CounterStrike2D.exe" for play..

- Enjoy !
