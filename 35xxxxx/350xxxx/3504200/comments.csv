,brinelol,2010-09-29T17:51Z,"these files are for OCTGN1, a program that hasn't been supported for several years now. Since then, the developer has been working on OCTGN2, a much more improved version that uses a completely different file structure.
As such, these files will NOT work on OCTGN2. If you wish to use the older OCTGN1 file, then these ARE the recommended files. Just be aware that OCTGN1 is no longer supported.

In addition, these files are not the OFFICIAL versions, and as such are liable to have incorrect information, unofficial modifications, or compatibility issues."
