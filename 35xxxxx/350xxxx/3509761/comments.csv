,I3lackDragon,2006-11-28T13:49Z,"How do i SPLIT these files???? =(
I already used Cue Spliiter and MediaMonkey...
None of these worked to split or convert the audio format... -_-
I think because its chinese."

,scottyarch,2008-01-18T03:20Z,"I... I will give you one of my children for this. You, sir, rock. Thou rockest upon a level not yet reached by man!"
,ccx,2008-03-31T08:51Z,"Can anyone tell me encoding of the .cue files? some are EUC-JP, few Shift-JIS. The rest is a mystery to me.
I will split the files, tag them according to MusicBrainz and encode into flac (the monkeyaudio guys can't even write valid license agreement).
I will seed after I'm done reencoding."
,yobmn,2008-04-15T05:21Z,ccx: How is the reencoding going? I'd much prefer properly tagged flac to all this mess of formats. (I'm getting this anyway though-but I'll seed yours when I see it up).
,zackary87kr,2009-04-01T17:46Z,"Will be seeding this for a long, long, long time! Thank you so much for this upload!"

,garfield1974,2009-06-05T23:13Z,"This is an AMAZING torrent! So much work has been put into this, it's perfect! Even the booklets of the CD's have been scanned :) 

I've had good luck with LameXP to convert to 320kbs mp3, for players that don't do ape. For other formats, Monkey's Audio own decompresser will convert to wav. Medieval CUE Splitter can split the cue/ape files with proper names. Mp3tag can tag it all."
,mabus6277,2009-07-13T03:43Z,"YOU HAVE NO CLUE how bad i want this, but with a lack in space on my hard drive i cant >.< not to mention the lack of space on my Zune,

 just as a question does anyone know what the size of this is when converted to .mp3 or .wmv? since those are some of the only formats the Zune takes"
,mabus6277,2009-07-13T03:46Z,*cries and stabs his laptop for lack of space*
,mabus6277,2009-07-14T06:18Z,getting it anyway so ples seed!

,Jaggid1x,2010-01-22T22:35Z,Thank you!
,xorhex,2010-05-13T16:36Z,"For those having a tough time decoding the files:

the CUE and TXT files are being decoded in ASCII - you must decode them in CHINESE SIMPLIFIED (GB2312) and then save them in UNICODE (UNI-8) and SAVE for them to be usable on ENGLISH WINDOWS OSes.

This will then decode the info from the files from chinese language set encoding to Unicode, providing you with the correct Japanese Kanji/Hiragana/Kakakana.

Some CUE files are messed up though - still figuring out on how to repair a few of them. Will get back on how to do that.

To convert from the .APE files, install Foobar2000 and install the Monkey Audio Codec (APE) component and then also the FLAC encoding library .dll (google it) to work with Foorbar, then just simply right click the files after you've fixed the .cues/retagged with freedb and do Convert->... and select FLAC, of course, to whatever compression level you want and POOF, you got your FLAC files!

Still working on how to create then CUE files intended for the .ape files to work then with .flac files so you can reburn the files back to CD with Exact Audio Copy or Nero (since FLAC can go back to WAV, which you should know if you know anything about lossless, which is why you're downloading this torrent).

Sorry for the lengthy post, enjoy my info!"
,xorhex,2010-05-13T16:38Z,"Oh, and to add, how to do said things with converting the text ... use Notepad++ for Windows and following the ENCODING->Character Sets->Chinese->Simplified with all the text selected. Then resave."
,xorhex,2010-05-13T16:42Z,"Oh, and another thing before I come back in a few weeks / or sooner after figuring how to fix some of the misbehaving CUE files ...

All the .txt files in the folders are TRACKLISTINGS and also provide PROOF of the rip's source (notice the VICL-XXXX at the top, which means the source was from the official Victor CDs, rather than the knockoff Taiwan/Chinese bootlegs that you see on ebay/Amazon/any other anime store now since most of Yoko's stuff is out of print in Japan).

See http://www.animecornerstore.com/faq.html#1-5 for more Bootleg/How to tell what's real before you get duped buying fakes online"
,camane81,2010-06-27T19:33Z,You rule ducksegg! worth the whole wait downloading this thing. keep on keeping on! 
,ChrisKnight,2011-03-21T02:46Z,"To convert the files on a Mac: 

Get TextWrangler, and in the Preferences, change the 'Text Encodings' setting: ""If file's encoding can't be guessed, use:"" to Chinese (GB 18030).

Open the .cue and .txt files and you should be able to see the Japanese characters. Change the encoding pop-up at the bottom of the window to ""Unicode (UTF-8 with BOM)"" and save!

It's important to use the BOM version, since we're changing encoding types.

To convert to some other format (I like Apple Lossless), download XLD, and in the Preferences, change the 'Character encoding of CUE sheet"" to ""Unicode UTF-8), and you  should be able to just Open the .cue files and encode from there.

Thanks to all the seeders & especially ducksegg for the original torrent!"
