I hope when your time comes to depart this great planet, it will be at the hands of an amputee.. or should I say, at the hand of an amputee :)  That would be a fitting ending for FatFuckFrank.  "

You obviously find them disgusting, not everybody else is so narrowminded. I bet many disabled find it insulting that you would so readily dismiss them as freaks. And why would you bring up FFF:s demise? That's just wrong."
