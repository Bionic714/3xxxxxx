,Karras,2006-07-18T20:20Z,"Very nice indeed!
Thank you Kat!"
,_Kat_,2006-07-19T01:47Z,No problem! ;-)
,Snalin,2006-07-24T11:03Z,"Is these DLCs actually working? i have downloaded Wizards tower A LOT, but i just get the message, the tower isn't there.

And i do hope you don't need a registration for them."
,_Kat_,2006-07-25T05:36Z,Ehm it worked for me and DLC's are simply 2 files that you place in the right folder ĂŠt voila your done.
,Catalyst666,2006-07-28T04:11Z,"omg it's downloading so slow, like 2kb/s... :-/"
,_Kat_,2006-07-30T05:11Z,I'm not uploading this 24/7 of course so when I'm not uploading it'll probably not be very fast. However I have just uploaded to someone along with 2 other seeders and the peer downloaded at a nice 120 Kb/s so if you'd just keep the torrent online a couplt of good seeders will upload the torrent quite fast. You may also want to give the DLC you'd like best the highest priority so you have something to play around with while the rest of the torrent is getting downloaded.
,starshipsea,2006-08-03T20:03Z,this one doesn't include Wizards Tower. Still a good job. Thanks!
,starshipsea,2006-08-03T20:04Z,Oh I'm wrong. It's complete. Thanks!!!
,_Kat_,2006-08-04T00:32Z,"Hehe, for a second I thought ""NOOO!!!"" but then I read your second comment. ;-)"
,GR3NAD3,2006-08-05T19:38Z,why did you think that did you have to do some thing or was it just a mistake
,_Kat_,2006-08-06T00:57Z,"All you gotta do is place the files in the DATA folder and all will work. In the pop-up menu you have to active the plugins, he probably forgot to enable the Wizards Tower."

,link5261,2009-09-29T22:39Z,"@Pankakes: Once you've installed Oblivion from the torrent's ISO image (the only thing you download is basically the installation CD), there'll be a folder called 'Data' in your Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Oblivion folder directory. When people say place in the Data folder, they mean there."
