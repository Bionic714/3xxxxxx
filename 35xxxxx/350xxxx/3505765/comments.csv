,The_Hangar_18,2006-07-22T12:10Z,"I tested it on 2 different machines - sucessfull
gusty987 installed it, too

Be sure u start the installer with OllyDbg.exe - not separatly. Make it exactly as described.

And nuk - i got my information from a forum without any publication of the author or something like that. What is your demand?"
,The_Hangar_18,2006-07-22T12:13Z,"And neo, you canÂ´t ""crack"" the program. You can only ""read out"" a valid serial for your machine with this debugger software OllyDbg."
,neo258,2006-07-22T12:30Z,my mistake bad word used. but a tryied it 100 times and nothing is working and im reading and applied what its said every time :-(
,The_Hangar_18,2006-07-22T13:32Z,"lled it on a third machine, its worked. Did you start the installer in ollydbg (press f3 and choose installer)? Did u press f9 till the installer starts? Did u once more press f9 till the installer want a decition how to insert u serial? Did u enter a ""wrong"" code like 3345346667, wait for error message, go back to olly? Watch the window in lower right corner, scroll up or down till u spot the first red colored words. Scroll a littel bit up, there should be a valid serial."
,NuKleus,2006-07-22T13:45Z,"@The_Hangar_18 - I have no demand! - You've stated that this method works, which is true for some BUT not for all.

When I wrote the original document specifically for PB users, after a short period it was removed for good reason... I leave the responsibility of its re-seed in you hands!

,The_Hangar_18,2006-07-22T14:05Z,Ok and when this method works only for 50% - so this 50% are lucky. Wayne?
