 The Skinny: A sequel that makes sense. Election 2 takes the themes and stories presented in the original film and brings them to a logical and ingeniously appropriate end. Those who found the first film boring or unexciting will likely not find Election 2 much better, but fans of the first should be very pleased. So far, this is the class of 2006.
