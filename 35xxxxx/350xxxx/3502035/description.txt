Baboon's excellent album, Face Down in Turpentine.  This was recorded in 1994.  It's difficult to describe their sound, and I've never been good at describing music, anyway.  Back in 1994 they were a very loud band, and it's evident on this one.  There's a lot of punk influence in there, but sometimes they have a trombone in there and all kinds of shit.
