The Brothers Quay are a pair of identical twins from Pennsylvania who live and work in England. In these eleven stop-motion shorts, you'll see a lot of mechanical creatures, dismemberment, and calligraphy, set to music. It's an almost completely visual (and aural) experience, with usually just the skeletons of stories, and whatever symbolism you choose to find. The brothers describe their influences as the animation of Jan Svankmajer (who made the movie Alice), and Eastern-European and South American literature. I think the best time to watch these is when you have a fever, and my favorite is The Comb.

Oddly, used copies of this out-of-print DVD are going for hundreds of dollars on Amazon.

A new feature-length, live action movie by the Brothers Quay, The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes, is supposed to be released soon in the United States, and is already out on DVD in Europe.
