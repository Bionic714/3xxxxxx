Exit 57 was a half-hour sketch comedy series produced by HBO Downtown Productions for the Comedy Central cable network in 1995 and 1996.

The sketches took place within the fictional suburban setting of Quad Cities.  The opening credits depicted the five cast members standing near their broken down car on the side of the highway. A bizarre motorist picks them up. The driver was listening to a news report on the radio about a serial killer, but he changes the station. The song "If I Knew You Were Coming I'd Have Baked a Cake" plays as he holds a camera up to snap photos of each passenger. Paul, Stephen, Jodi, Amy, and Mitch become visibly suspicious of their driver's strange behavior and they ask him to pull off the highway onto Exit 57.

The stars and creators of Exit 57 (Paul Dinello, Stephen Colbert, Amy Sedaris, Mitch Rouse) all knew each other from their days with the famed Second City comedy troupe.

During Exit 57's two-year run, the show earned five CableACE Award nominations for best writing, performing, and comedy series.
