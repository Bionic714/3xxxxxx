Please don't let us hungry, we're looking forward for the next days also, keep the excellent quality of the rip ;D"

,turtle,2006-07-14T06:38Z,"hey cool, i had uploaded a couple of tourneys, thanks for taking up the reigns!  i'll help seed too.  keep up the great work."
,loys,2006-07-14T17:26Z,"I'm seeding 3rd day (mikka-me)

thank you very much !
it's very nice !"
,jalopiimae,2006-07-15T17:48Z,"We have seeders so it would be nice if you could continue uploading rest of basho, now it is started. Any case big thanxs of your effort ^-^ !!!"
,rlk2319,2006-07-16T01:18Z,"I'm seeding days 2 and 3.  Please keep uploading, watching these Sumo matches are great!"
,jalopiimae,2006-07-17T22:34Z,I decided to give up seeding because I do not believe anymore that zlo666 returns to upload rest of basho. He does not even bother to reply. I think it is waist of my bandwidth to contribute with seeding help if somebody has no intention complete the seeding he started. Pity :(
,zlo666,2006-07-19T22:54Z,"I'm back :)
I took a short trip...
Anyways, had some problems with scheduling and recording software (MyTheatre), so some days have been lost. Pity, because I was really looking forward to watching the entire tournament and I can't watch it live, since I'm at work that time of day :(

Stay tuned, next release coming up shortly..."
,zlo666,2006-07-19T23:07Z,"@turtle:
Yes, I certainly do remeber that you uploaded the basho. And I'm so much grateful for that, it was my first chance to watch sumo after very long time (until recently NHK wasn't available where I live). Thank you."
