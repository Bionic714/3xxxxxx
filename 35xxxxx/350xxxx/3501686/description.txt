It is difficult to describe the music of Exuma.  Many times, there is not much in the way of instrumentation; most of the songs are anchored around his singing and acoustic guitar playing.  It is undeniably African-influenced, with much exotic percussion, but it is also grounded in Voodoo beliefs found in the West Indies.  His guitar playing is solid, but not flashy. He once said in an
interview, "I only know a few chords, but I can stretch them out!"  His greatest instrument was his voice.  It was a thing of ragged beauty.  Neither too high nor low, it compelled and beckoned, sounding as if he had experienced many things in many planes.
