this application allows you to put applications in the system tray.
This is the second time I put this up.

there is now an uninstaller included,the hide .exe only hides the command prompt that starts the application that's it. I did not want to see the splash screen or the command prompt window on logon, so trayit!.exe starts minimized (unseen) you can see it in the taskmanager and hide.exe hides the command prompt that starts the application. Hope that explains everything before some ignorant fool cries virus.
