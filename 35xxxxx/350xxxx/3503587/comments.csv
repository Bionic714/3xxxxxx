Dark ambient, martial music and military pop is what the genres are called."

I was listening to this sort of thing before your arse was as big as a
buttonhole; fuck off, you nerd."
,faithinanarchy,2007-08-09T17:08Z,"funny how there are two guys arguing over the term 'goth'. i wasn't aware that either of you lived between the 1st BC and 5th AD centuries when the only real 'goths' lived, so really, you are both talking shit.

,ViolenceIsGolden,2008-03-19T22:36Z,You're wrong.  Rock is a hard thing on the ground.
,Al98ve19n,2008-06-01T18:23Z,god stop doing that it's music it's nice from what i understood (haven't listen to it yet) so whats your problem what it is? goth was a oldnation and they are nothing like now (and music abd style totaly diferent). but's there no problem in that. i don't know what you are saing but the music you call goth-gothig makes me feel happy and some times i find it and funny and not at all melancholic and i know good of that kinds of music ( i hear from my 8 and now i'm 19 years old so i think something i know) nothing dark for me at least. it's just a style for me and some times i get really bored of that style
