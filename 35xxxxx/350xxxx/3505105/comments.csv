This doesn't quite look like it is for a Mac..."
,sundazed,2006-07-19T22:37Z,"Um? What the fuck does ""Um"" mean? Can't you think before you, um, write?"
,Cynic821,2006-07-20T04:05Z,LOL @ Sundazed

It was pretty obvious what he meant (I he was employing ""irony"") and it is also equally obvious to anyone who has ever had a Mac that a .exe file doesn't work on MacOS."
,sundazed,2006-07-22T17:39Z,"So THAT'S irony! Oh, hang on... ""the expression of one's meaning by using language that normally signifies the opposite, typically for humorous or emphatic effect"" ... it's not!

Yawn."

,sundazed,2006-07-22T21:27Z,"Hey, great! Let's have a slanging match! Why have you signed yourself ""moron""? Pursuit of accuracy I suppose."
,sundazed,2006-07-22T21:30Z,"... and the internet is whatever you want it to be, dickhead (including a phone). But you're right about irony."
,ghazten,2006-07-24T11:53Z,Nice to have something to bitch about.
,sundazed,2006-07-24T15:03Z,So true.
,VileCore,2008-06-13T15:19Z,"Hey, Sundazed. Stop trying to suck your own dick, it's embarrasing. Gaja: You're a retard. Enzeth: Aren't you the retard who posted demos around here?"
