,Mr Silver,2006-07-01T23:25Z,"For 5.43M does it matter???? It's also free!

Thnx NOVA DBX."
,Jassie12,2006-07-02T10:28Z,What I'm saying is that it's a bit too small I think.....
,PHBFO,2006-07-02T11:00Z,"Yes indeed!
Take a look at the Posky 737, I mean, that includes model, textures and more, so does this.
And their 737 is bigger then 5.43MB/"

It was obvious that this package does not contain a proper panel and sound set, as its size is below 10MB.

Package contains a model (I guess) and three liveries (KLM, SBM and TUI) only - no sound, no panel, no gauges..."
