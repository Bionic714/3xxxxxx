,SweetNucca,2006-07-18T20:47Z,"This movie is truly a piece of trash that insults the original story by H.G. Wells as well as the 1950's movie. Speilberg has lost it (like George Lucas) and War of the Worlds is a worthless pile of steaming shit not worthy of watching.

Bad script
Bad acting
Bad plot (or lack thereof)
Bad, bad, bad, bad

Continuity is off, disbelief must be suspended into the land of the Teletubbies to make it watchable.

Take a lot of drink and drugs to make it an enjoyable film."
