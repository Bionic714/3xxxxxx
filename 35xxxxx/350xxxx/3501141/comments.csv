,Nobody!,2006-07-06T16:32Z,"Cut version :(

Just avoid the R2 UK release for being cut and having a non-anamorphic transfer.

R2 United Kingdom - (Warner Bros Home Entertainment) - Yes. Cut for violence (15 secs):
- During the fight in a bar towards the beginning of the film - when Seagal is searching for his neice - 6 secs of Seagal twice slamming his fist into a thugs nose has been removed.
- In the finale, when Seagal briefly fights Henry Silva, a 4 sec shot of Seagal breaking Silva's arm - with a loud crunch - has been removed, but the subsequent neck break seems intact. The cinema release appears to be uncut.
