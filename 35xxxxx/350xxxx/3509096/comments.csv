,007craft,2008-01-27T08:18Z,"big respect for this torrent.

I cant stand how 95% of thepiratebay and every other non scene site doesnt know anything about quality.  It boggles the mind why such bad quality rips circle the net in droves of everything.

Anyone who pays attention to quality desrves respect.

Thanks for this.  I was wondering when some1 would get proper tv rips of season 1 and 2"
,007craft,2008-01-29T01:12Z,"after check out the episodes i gotta say im dissapointed that this dinothunderback guy encoded a short msg into the rips saying that he did them.  Thats great and all that he did them, and im thankful, but dont overlap your name in the film.  makes it look tacky and makes you look lame.  in 35 years from now when i pop this in my dvd player to watch again, am I or is anybody gonna care about dinothunderback, who could be anyone and means nothing?  What a shame.  When you do encodeds, put your name in the filename and make an nfo.  dont overlap your crap over the video itself."
,007craft,2008-02-07T03:05Z,"btw dont download this guys.  get this one instead http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3509098/Reboot_hq

Difference is episode 1x7 in this pack is oversized and not seeded.  go get the other one."
