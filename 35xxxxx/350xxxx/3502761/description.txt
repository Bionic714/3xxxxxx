Proper note:

We were sorry to notice that an old respected group such as Razor1911
unable to crack the Securom protection present in this release of Prey
attempted to get away by using a nonretail exe version of the game protected
by Themida
The retail version of the game is stamped
"Prey 1.0.103 win-x86 Jun 10 2006 00:44:11"
while the exe build of the nonretail version Razor used is
"Prey 0.2.99 win-x86 Jun 6 2006 00:49:30"

We hope they will refrain from such actions in the future so as to respect
the good name Razor built up in the past. We always have respect for fair
and honest competition, so we hope Razor does better in the future :)

Game note:

Prey tells the story of Tommy, a Cherokee garage mechanic stuck on a
reservation going nowhere. His life changes when an otherworldly crisis
forces him to awaken spiritual powers from his long-forgotten birthright
Abducted along with his people to a menacing mothership orbiting Earth, he
sets out to save himself and his girlfriend and eventually his planet. Prey
is serious, dark story, based on authentic Cherokee mythology. Themes of
sacrifice, love and responsibility are explored and the story dives into
emotional territory not yet explored by similar games
