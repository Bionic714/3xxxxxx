,Stonaar,2006-07-12T13:34Z,"SOTBMP, this is indeed that version.
But it seriously needs some seeders :D"
,mulrich,2006-07-12T13:36Z,"Read the note in the readme, dumbass..."
,adamscybot,2006-07-12T14:09Z,"Yep, this is the true version. The Razor is also real BUT it has the beta EXE making it pretty much useless. 

Its about time someone released the retail of this!"
,SOTBMP,2006-07-12T14:20Z,Thanks for the informations.
,majtymicke,2006-07-12T16:37Z,"Razor1911´s offical reply

First of all, you're right in that our crack is based on a Themida-protected exe,
BUT -as anyone who purchased an ESD copy via www.playtriton.com can easily check-
it's FINAL & RETAIL. "
,majtymicke,2006-07-12T16:37Z,"And if you would have taken the time to examine both exes a
little more carefully you would have known that they are absolutely identical at
function level (not even mentioning the performance penalty and 10+MB of useless
junk code/data your Securom crack introduces)."
,majtymicke,2006-07-12T16:38Z,"We conclude: invalid proper and using the ESD exe has been a reasonable choice.
(But as likewise honorable competitors we'll leave the choice to the users).

this one is) and let's see what the future might bring..."

I downloaded the version buzz_uk posted and its working without any prob so far. have just played past the map after the demo.. dunno name but its not far.. like 40-60min game time so far?
I'll still download this version. Even though the other is probobly the 3day pre-launched downloaded from HumanHead studio and is indeed full version and so on. Downside is that this is devided into 3 discs instead of a DVD.

Anyways.. Plz post if anyone finds something, however unlikely, new with this version compared to the clonedvd version. I.e. new maps and content.

Great work peeps keep it up. Cheers :D"

,tom_mach,2006-09-07T12:01Z,"To all guys having problems with this one:

I. Unrar with WINRAR starting from: rld-prya.rar, rld-pryb.rar and rld-pryc.rar files. Don't use different programs to unrar archive. If you do so you might not get rld-pryb.cue file because it isn't located in first archive package: rld-pryb.rar. Only WINRAR will unpack complete archive.

II. After this you should have 6 files:
rld-prya.bin
rld-prya.cue
rld-pryb.bin
rld-pryb.cue
rld-pryc.bin
rld-pryc.cue
What to do with them?
1. Use Daemon Tools to mount virtual drive from image bin and cue files
   or
2. Use Nero to burn three CDs from cue and bin files. USE Write method: Disc at Once/96 (it's important!)
3. CD-KEY is in: reloaded.nfo file in this torrent. Read it! It has also all necessary information how to install and run  
PREY CD-Keys are:
     D23B-DPBA-BCRP-TABP-15 (I used this one - worked)
     D23C-DPCA-BCRP-TABP-7A
     D23D-DPDA-BCRP-TABP-76
4. Cracked Prey.exe file is on first CD. To access it you have to burn first CD from *.bin and *.cue files or mount bin file with Daemon Tools. Copy this file overwriting original Prey.exe. After that game stops asking for original CD1.
5. Walkthrough for PREY: type ""prey walkthrough"" in GOOGLE and you'll find it.
I hope it helps you run and enjoy PREY.
Best regards. Tommy"

I've done everything correctly ((i think lol i got to play 4 a bit so i guess so))

but...

at the ""escape velocity"" ((or whatever it is)) level, after fall of the ""ride"" n start walking...  the game gets an unexpected error n closes the game (-_-)

if u know how to fix this, please let me know (^_^) i'd be most thankful!"
,sk8er_boy2486,2008-04-16T07:33Z,"Hey taiiat ((im somewhat of a noob but i learn quick, so if my info doesnt help, my bad))

[i'm not sure if this is the right torrent im talkin about but i think it'll help]

for ur answer, u have 2 extract those files 1st.  there will be multiple files in each CD folder... ur gonna need winrar to extract them ((i dont have a link but just google ""winrar"" if u dont have it already..  its free so dont worry about it))

[1.a]either open up winrar and go to the directory.  search thru the list until u see the file that ends with "".r00"" (without the quotes).  highlight it n extract it ((i usually just click ok if u dont know where u want to put it))

or

[1.b] double click on any rar file n it should open up the winrar program. once the program opens, double click on the "".."" (without the quotes).  it sould be on top of the list.  then search for the rar file that ends with "".r00"" and click extract.

[2] extract the remaining cd folders like u did in #1

[3] ((from wat u said, i assume u have daemon tools)) mount the newly extracted file in CD1 folder.  Follow the instructions to install.
It will eventually ask u for a CD Key...  a few r provided in the NFO document ((if u dont know, right-click it n go to ""open with"">>""notepad""))

D23B-DPBA-BCRP-TABP-15

that was the 1st one on the list n it worked for me so try it out.

[4] after a bit of installation, its gonna ask u 2 insert disk 2.  just unmount the CD1 file n mount the img from CD2.  do the same for CD3 when asked for it.

after completing the installation, remount the file in CD1.  close the menu that pops up.  go to ""my computer"" n right click on ""prey"" and click explore.  once the menu pops up, open up the crack n copy the .exe file to the directory that the game was installed in.  ((i installed it elsewhere so im not sure where the default directory is))

--hope this helps (^_^)





ok, i've helped some1 ((hopefully lol))

so can some1 plz tell me what's wrong? i've downloaded like 3 different torrents thinkin it was the torrent that was having the issue.  but its not.  i've set all the setting to low so that's not it.  im almost positive that my comp is capable of running the game so i ""should"" meet the minimum requirements.

so if u have any tips or ideas on how to fix my issue that'd be great! (^_^)

>>my issue is that the game keeps crashing when it gets to the 3rd scene ((or whatever u call it)) ""on the run""

the part after u fall off the ""ride"" n go thru the ""butthole"" lookin door. . it crashes after a few steps just as that ""thing"" passes by.

so far the farthest i got was with torrent Prey.DVD-RELOADED with 1 feet lol i think it's the same file but...  ehh.. i thought i gave it a shot..  im about 2 delete the cd's if i dont find a solution soon.  i REALLY want to play this game so if u could help me out, that would b SUPER! (^_^)"
,sk8er_boy2486,2008-05-07T15:55Z,"another cd key? i'm no professional so i can't really help u there.. the only cd keys that i know of is in the ""MSinfo"" file that u can open with notepad.  just right click>open with>notepad  (if notepad isnt there, click on choose program>then pick notepad)

OH wait!

did you mount cd1 with daemon tools (or something similar), open my computer.  right-click on the mounted cd and click explore.  there should be a ""crack"" folder, open it and copy the ""exe"" file of the game to the installation directory.
