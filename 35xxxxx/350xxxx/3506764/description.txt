Moongarden - "The Gates Of Omega"(2001)

Moongarden is an extremely beautiful Italian neo-prog band. They employ a wide variety of 

prog approaches. The music includes full symphonic prog, vocal oriented prog and even some 

very good improvisation. There is some nice flute and acoustic guitar as well. Overall I?d 

say they stylistically could be compared to Camel, Landmarq, Genesis and Pink Floyd but they 

sound like neither of these bands. For neo-progressive fans, Moongarden is a band that 

should not be missed.
