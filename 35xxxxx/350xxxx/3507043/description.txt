Mosley must choose between loyalty to his colleagues and protecting the witness, and never has such a short distance seemed so long...

Note: I kept the spanish DTS, so if you don't want it, you can delete it and you'll obtain -almost- a DVD5 (4'7Gb).
      If you also delete one of the 5.1, you can burn it directly in a DVDR.

Aviso: He eliminado los extras y he dejado el DTS en castellano; como la compresi√≥n del Rebuilder a DVD5 no terminaba de convencerme dejando el DTS (3200 de espacio para video), lo subo tal cual (5'11Gb) y quien no quiera mantenerlo, simplemente eliminando el DTS le queda la peli en (casi) un DVD5.
