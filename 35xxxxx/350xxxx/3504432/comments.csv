,sickofants,2008-01-08T04:57Z,"Thanks. I'm downloading this on the strength of a cover of Tecumseh Valley by Nanci Griffith. (Check it out)

If any of the others songs are half as good, I guess I'm in for a treat."
,dmastax1x,2008-12-04T00:56Z,"hey i just got Texas Troubadour, the box set and want to upload it since the other torrent on here isn't being seeded. I have no idea how to do it though. I can only select one song at a time for upload. Anyone know how to get the whole set as one torrent available for downloading? "
