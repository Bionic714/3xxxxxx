,subnivian,2008-05-06T03:56Z,"thanks a bunch,

not my favorite series though, the lectures on the period after the civil war seems forced.  i think you can do better with the lectures from UC Berkley's podcast.

the first two thirds of the series are much better"
,paratwa,2008-05-28T01:38Z,"thank you, bhangwalla"
,IGotDMCA,2010-02-01T11:15Z,I strongly recommend people not share this. I got a DMCA letter from them. They will enforce protection of their copyrights. Their stuff is high quality but I chose to delete it all after I got the letter.
,gmeades,2011-09-15T10:07Z,"sam322 is a jerk.  Putting a link to ""The International Jew: The Worlds Foremost Problem"" as a reference for the history of the United States is pure ignorance.  Henry Ford was sued, and was found guilty of slander and spreading false information because of this document, you twit.  other than as insight to that situation the document is otherwise not useful, as it is not based upon truth, at all. It was based upon ""The Elders of Zion"" which was a false document itself (look it up on wiki, and read most if not all of it for more insight into this trash). Moron."
,Drbj69,2011-10-10T09:22Z,"henry ford was right for some reason he owned the ford company and knew what was coming to america Bernard Madoff stole billions of dollars and now the economy is so bad what about AIPAC? the biggest lobby in the nation are you blind or you just watch the mainstream media, you know who owns it? you are smart enough "
