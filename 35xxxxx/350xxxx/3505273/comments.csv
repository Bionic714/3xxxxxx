[T],stevekasian,2006-07-20T09:21Z,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU WAIT TO SEE CONFIRMATION FROM RRODGER99 BEFORE DOWNLOADING THIS CRACK.

If he doesn't confirm it's real, it's a VIRUS!

He's already announced multiple times here not to trust a crack posted as a single DL, without the product included."
,pilgrim37,2006-07-20T09:32Z,And this is this persons first post? !! BEWARE
,sgnauz,2006-07-20T10:09Z,na na na.... this is shit
,Tri_Motor,2006-07-20T10:28Z,"LoL...LoL...LoL...LoL...LoL...LoL... give up already... we are very computer literate people here...  most here know code better than bill gates himself, so your attempts to do damage with your chicken shit code is feeble at best."
[T],stevekasian,2006-07-20T11:13Z,"I don't think they care tho - there's only a handfull of said 'litrate folks here, compared with the bazillions of n00b5 out there who come here to leech. So it actually sort of works out for everyone - all the leeches get fuct with viruses and end up getting scared and give it up, which, in the long run, helps take heat off the scene. Nice - I like this! Keep it up, Cloud9 fuckerz!

,sgnauz,2006-07-20T11:20Z,"I'm just wondering if they try again to post the same ""crack for all products"" and how will it 'll be described the next time! "
,Humpie,2006-07-20T11:40Z,"All you fgts need a virus anyways the amount of FS2004 spam in the game section is disgusting.

You guys really need your own torrent site or something. Mind you there are hundreds of thousands who visit here frequently and don't need this garbage spam shit you guys are doing for the .001% that actually download it.  "

Thanks to 4X-AXG and rrodger99 :)"

,rrodger99,2006-07-20T14:15Z,"@ Humpie

I'm sorry....I didn't realize the site had changed hands & is now Humpie's Pirate  Bay.

Now If you will look....there have been 9 posts in the last 24 hours (take your shoes off...count all the fingers & toes & then 4 more fingers) from a company spamming the site. These are all duly noted in the comments & do not have anything to do with the legit posts made here.

Do a little research before you post assinine comments."
,Traffic69,2006-07-20T15:37Z,My torrent work! is the dll from rrodger99!

,monstert,2006-11-25T05:18Z,"Well what the Dll actually does is delete your scenery CFG and Terrain CFG, this is triggered off by loading up FS9 with the crack inside the modules folder from cunt above...the remedy for that..simple..i backed up before i tried it :D Cloud9 are all cunts LOL....i'll give you some credit though..AMS and LAX are ace! Thanks haha...twats"

,connor11493,2007-08-15T19:33Z,Common guys - this isn't that small of a file. Can't someone see it for us?
,GoldenScimitar,2008-05-27T09:31Z,"The real problem is this:

There are no complete Cloud9 or FSDreamTeam downloads in TPB under the same BGLMan crack. So basically, even if I install 2 sceneries from Cloud9 that are under the same BGLMan, if I tried to install another Cloud9 airport available from TPB with a different BGLMan version, then that particular one will work, but the other cracks will be overwritten, making it hard to complete a full Cloud9 collection.

My request is, ALL Cloud9 sceneries under the SAME BGLMan crack. Please respond back to this. Thanks."
