,russinbulle,2006-07-21T16:17Z,Anyone who have or know where to get Van Dames The Quest from 1996?
,Rawern,2006-07-21T16:38Z,yes i have wake of dead   and black eagle.   but only black eagle with nordic sub.   there is no bloodsport with nordic sub.  oh on vhs mabye  hehe.  i will upload more when we get some seeders on this.
,jomos352,2006-07-21T18:20Z,"black eagle with nordic subtitles is okay, if it has audio english audio track. i have been looking for black eagle for years in my country but still be successful to get it. i would be very grateful if you can share it in the future. thanks a lot."
,jpor,2006-07-21T19:07Z,Thanx.  Yes please too for Kickboxer.
,Rawern,2006-07-21T20:10Z,sure i can upload kickboxer next   but it has no nordic sub. but it is a uncut version.  but first must get some seeders on this one.    the black eagle has  nordic subs  with english audio. takes a bit time to upload   cause our lines sucks here in norway.
,Mazu1982,2006-07-21T23:49Z,Would you happen to have Knock off? Nordic subs would be a nice bonus too.
,Rawern,2006-07-22T00:28Z,-yes i have that one to. but it will take some time for me to upload these movies  since i dont have a fast upload line.
,jomos352,2006-07-22T08:14Z,i got knock off but it has only chinese audio and subtitle. do u want it?
,murran_,2006-07-22T09:10Z,"Subs or no subs, these movies aint exactly famous for their great dialogue. Thanks for the upload, its appreciated "
,Mazu1982,2006-07-22T10:56Z,What about Rawerns version of knock off? Does it have nordic subs? The chinese audio and subs are not exactly ideal :)
,Rawern,2006-07-22T14:20Z,hehehe oh dont you like chinese :) sorry its not nordic subs on the   knock off  i have   english audio subs.  english dutch french .  
,Rawern,2006-07-23T10:38Z,can someone seed this  so i can upload some more ? 
,Ouroboros,2006-07-23T11:00Z,"DL 0 times. 
Rawern: You have let us get the torrent at least 1 time so that person can seed it and so on.
I would like to get a little more than the 53.5% I got right now. :("
,Rawern,2006-07-23T19:42Z,ok i have uploadet it 150 %  so someone must have got it all.  but  then again it is alot of get and run. 
,Ouroboros,2006-07-24T00:19Z,"It says at the top that this torrent have been downloaded 0 times. So either piratebay have trouble updating the site or no one has downloaded it yet. :(
I know I haven't, but I have uploaded about 30Gb since yesterday. So please SEED now. I need about 1Gb more."
,Rawern,2006-07-24T00:28Z,yes i think the  update on the piratebay isnt correct.   il upload so you get it :) 
,jomos352,2006-07-24T12:27Z,i can help u seed as long as i finish. but it's gonna take some time 'coz my speed is super slow.

,Rawern,2006-07-24T23:20Z,dont someone got it yet ? i have allmost uploadet it 3 times now.   
,odda29,2006-07-25T17:06Z,Can those who seed this and using uTorrent turn their seeding into Super-seeding. Because then you just fill in the blank spots and people will finish their download faster and start seeding as well!
