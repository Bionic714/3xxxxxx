Note:
This is Magnum Coltrane Price's third album. 
It's has never been at the P2P network and was never distributed via regular channels. I ask you to support this talented artist since he made this record on his own label working his ass off to distribute it to his fans. This is a really rare piece...I still haven't seen it anywhere on the P2P network. 

Please relax, listen and enjoy...and don't forget to seed it to others! Remember where you got it from...
