,Morinaren,2006-07-14T19:09Z,Where is the vile lair located?

,Arafel,2006-07-15T05:06Z,"@ Morinaren:

,Brakiss,2006-07-15T12:50Z,You will get a Quest where u can fast travel...
,Logan_5,2006-07-16T18:41Z,Works great!! Another fine releasefrom those who think that it is BS to pay for this 'content' when it *should* have been included in the base game..
,Thomas Pynchon,2006-07-16T23:52Z,"Logan_5, you dipshit, why do you insist on justifying your theft with hollow moral platitudes?"
,Sulan87,2006-07-17T06:44Z,"try this page, very good:

,Pharoth,2006-07-21T16:29Z,"Ok, so I have a problem with my copy of Oblivion as I read on the official site you need the 1.1.5 patch so this mod works, and well the at 8% instalation of the patch it stops and gives an error that the file installing is already there or not at all and cannot be overwriten...I've done all of the quests at The Dark Brotherhood also thinking that I might find the one that leads to the Vial Lair. If someone could tell me where the quest that leads there starts it would help alot so I know if I should reinstall the game.(P.S. No my Obli copy is not from direct2drive.)"
,roobeerjr,2006-07-26T20:02Z,"ok, i found the lair and it's empty and i found the journal, but when i go to talk to the guy about furnishing my lair he's there and he says he's got some hard to find things but there aren't any options to buy anything. some help would be apreciated."
,r0bb1n,2006-11-03T07:55Z,"i realy hope you will upload the new mod 2: knights of the nine divine. it looks like an awesome mod to me but i am not realy glad with paying $9,99 for it. so upload that one 2!!!"
,Zryo,2009-06-12T18:26Z,"You can make this work by pressing the tilde ""~"" key to bring up the console then input the following command with out the quotes.

""setstage DLCdeepscorn 10""

Inputing this command will give you the key to the door then mark it on your map. It's south as far as you can go east south-east of leyawiin. If you were to head to bogwater camp east of leyawiin then head south to the coast then head west again directly along the coast you will come to a bridge to a small island. Directly south of that island is an entrance to a cave. Near the land coming out of a hollowed-out tree is the lair entrance but you have to dive. 

DON""T USE THE CONSOLE TO CHEAT THE DOOR OPEN!!! or the quest will not start. Use that console setstage command before entering.

If Rowdy Eardruff will not sell you what you need use the console command to cheat your mercantile up to 50.

""player.setAV mercantile 50"""
,Zryo,2009-06-12T18:32Z,"Oh and Rowley Eardwulf only sells what you need at... 12am-12pm and 2pm-8pm

,Zryo,2009-06-12T18:40Z,"One more comment... Vile Lair is like a little baby vampire lair. For the Grand Vampire experience download Blackclaw Castle.
