Super Bust-A-Move for the PS2 by Taito / Acclaim

1-2 Players
129K minimum on Memory Card

ISO created using WinImage from the original PS2 CD. 
128MB when fully extracted, 32MB ISO while compresses
Tested on a PS2 with Network adaptor, Seagate 160GB HDD, HDAdvance 3

Runs perfectly ok on that setup, no modchip needed with the HDD.

Unsure if it will work when burnt to CD though

If I\\\'ve done the torrent right, enjoy the game as it\\\'s not in the shops anymore!
