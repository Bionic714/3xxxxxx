As requestet:

All Flight1 dewrappers. You can install 100% of F1┬┤s products (aircrafts & scenery) but not programs (because the .exe files are separatly protected, too).

Use the loader v230 in dos mode for the most aircrafts, follow the included readme.txt in the zip file. When v230 failes, try the oter dewrappers.

For help, just ask here in forum. I can explain you which dewrapper your need for your favorite F1 addon.
