This is the full XBOX 360 version of the game with the SS patch already applied. 
Will work with PAL version consoles that have the Xtreme firmware applied. 
Image should be burned to DVD+R DL discs using the latest Slysofts CloneCD. 
Recorders should be able to support bitsetting to DVD-ROM. ENJOY!
