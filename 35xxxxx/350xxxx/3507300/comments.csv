,DSLLL,2006-07-27T20:15Z,"I have not been able to find a program that converts from flac to mp3.   If anyone knows of one, please post it :)"
,vinylking,2006-07-28T01:21Z,"The point with wlac is that it reduces the original wav to about halv the size, while mp3 in 192 kbps reduces it to 1/7 of the original quality. I think that talks for itself. And even better, if two tracks is recorded with no space between them, mp3 makes a hearable silence of about 30 milliseconds, and flac doesn't.  But if you think mp3 is enough, don't download this and don't complain!"
,vinylking,2006-07-28T01:37Z,"To burn or convert flac to Wav or something else use this link if you use Nero 7. I have just uploaded it
http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3507826
Otherwise, download Easy CD DA Extractor. It works fine too"
,bobzimmerman,2006-07-28T08:36Z,mp3 sucks lossless rules 
,vinylking,2006-07-28T11:01Z,"To convert or burn flac, if you use Nero 7, search for Nero Plugin Pack or dowload Easy CD-DA Extracrot"
,Hodedudedik,2006-07-31T15:23Z,"The ""point"" of FLAC is that it is an open source lossless codec. That means that it is in perfect quality, if someone didn't understand.

As for a converter, there are many programs that do that, one of them is this one (BonkEnc Audio Encoder):
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=27149&package_id=59807

The developers description:
""BonkEnc is a CD ripper, audio encoder and converter for various formats. It can produce MP3, MP4 / M4A, Ogg Vorbis, AAC, Bonk and FLAC files. BonkEnc supports freedb protocol level 6 (Unicode), CDText and ID3v2 tags and is available in several languages. """
,Hodedudedik,2006-07-31T15:24Z,"That one, BonkEnc, is free, and you do not need to buy or download Nero to do that."
,Earcandy,2007-12-08T19:09Z,"Once again, thanks for sharing Johnny Cash with us. What a great music icon!! Also, like most people [except the clueless ones], I agree that FLAC does rule. When you burn the FLAC files to disc [I use Nero], it's just like having the original. All the albums that I'm uploading are FLAC.      MP3 is for i-pods and such."
,bigbinc,2008-02-25T17:10Z,Thanks a lot for putting these in FLAC!
,LinuxUsersRule,2008-04-23T20:37Z,"Please include EAC LOG file at then at least we know it is recorded from the original. Lately  I have downloading FLAC files that were converted from 128 MP3's! It ain't right MAN.

Original CD->EAC->FLAC->LOG (Only please!)

NOT MP3->FLAC NOT"
,topic58,2008-05-02T11:28Z,"mpeg3 is crap if you want to listen to real music. Flac is the real thing. And a bit smaller than wave. And thanks to that possible to upload/ download for us nice people who want the real thing. There must be a reason why CD-albums doesnt sell in mpeg3, right?"
,Spanky-F,2009-01-06T18:27Z,"I don't know if it was only my download but the files all had "".fla"" as an extension instead of "".flac"".  Easy enough to fix by just adding the ""c"" to the end of the file name.
Great Quality!"
