Meet Ichabod Crane, the spindly schoolteacher who dreams of sweeping the lovely Katrina off her feet - until Brom Bones, the boisterous town bully gets involved. Their comic rivalry introduces Ichabod to 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow', the fabled Headless Horseman and a hair-raising heart thumping climax.
Mickey Mouse, Goofy, Donald Duck and Pluto star in a lively version of Mark Twain's immortal classic! When a pampered Prince and a humble Peasant, temporarily switch lives and "mouse-querade" as each other, it leads to a fun-filled finale to return the rightful heir to the throne!
