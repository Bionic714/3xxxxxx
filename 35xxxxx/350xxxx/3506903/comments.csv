,Son Of Mogh,2006-07-25T03:36Z,"Yeah right. I downloaded this some time ago and it wasn't bigger than 4,5 gb. Now you're upping it in 8,5 gb? What are those archive disks of 700 mb each? Did you upload the game in rared AND unrared form? That would explain why it is 8,5 gb. So if someone wants to grab this, don't grab the archive disks, just the iso of the full game. Or go find the real thing somewhere else. It's upped in a lot of places."
,arepadar,2006-11-02T17:30Z,"The 1.1 patch came out right after the release, fixing among other things the ability to invert mouse.

Anyone know if there is a crack to 1.1?"
,nighthawk.117,2007-01-05T11:18Z,seed plz I'm stuck at 58 %
,sebzapata,2007-04-28T13:25Z,"i want to put this onto dvd so do i just download the rld-trl.iso 
do i need any other files?

thanks"
,Sabbathman,2007-09-04T23:25Z,"This shit doesn't work for me, some CRC file missing."
,ovelix2814,2007-11-05T15:23Z,thanks
,Karlberg92,2007-11-11T19:25Z,Please Seed!! I will seed when finished
,Sabbathman,2008-01-03T22:44Z,"CRC file missing for me to.
8 gig for nothing?
Download time: over 24 hours.
I rather buy the game on disc, there are almost no seeders elsewhere."
,potakanutm,2008-02-03T18:59Z,"Dunno what this CRC file thing is. However, the problem is easily fixed. Just mount the disc image (rld-trl.iso) with Daemon, and you're all set."
,PirateX22,2008-02-08T04:20Z,if the crc message pops up just start the download of this torrent again and it will pick itself back up to about 95-98% and let it finish downloading and that should fix the problem. I got that same error and i did that and it fixed the issue along with all the other games that i got that error on.
,profs89,2008-06-03T10:04Z,"people just relax and download one file just
""rld-trl.iso"" 4.31 GB"
,jogados,2008-06-10T22:47Z,"Ok people, just like the man said, ignore all other stuff and focus on ""rld-trl.iso"", you can mount it with Alcohol120 if you don't have the daemon tool. It WILL install the game, for future downloads, just download the file ""rld-trl.iso"" which is 4.31 GB, you don't have to download 8 gigs....Potakanutm tnx."
,TMA2,2008-07-14T18:21Z,haha this fucktard included both the image AND the extracted contents. way to go
,Hashassin,2008-11-19T21:28Z,only one seeder??? please dont seed its bether without this one seeder
,Aftro,2009-05-06T20:28Z,"Just downloaded the game and it works great so far i played, no problems with the installation and just like the others said download only the ""rld-trl.iso"" and the crack folder if you want (the crack is also included on the .iso)"
,Fanx,2011-01-30T21:45Z,"To all those bitching about the fact the uploader has included extracted files .... are you too fucking stupid to know what you want, and too stupid to pick and choose?
I've already got a copy of Legend, but it's failed and I need one file to fix it and I'm pleased I don't have to download the whole game if I don't wish to. If you don't have the smarts to figure it out then that's your problem, not Zabriski's.
Now STFU."
