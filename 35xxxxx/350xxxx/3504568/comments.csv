,gusty987,2006-07-18T06:25Z,How do I install this?
,spin6,2006-07-18T07:16Z,"""unrecognized disk"" means, that the cd-data is old. 0603 is from march2006 and jeppview doesnt like old data. temporarly set your system date to month march and it will work."

Please read the description

1. "" By request""

2. ""I have not installed this""

That means I have not tested this & you are downloading at your own risk.

I you have a better version...feel quite free to upload it."
,cholubaz,2006-07-20T23:10Z,"Got it installed ok. rolling the date back to march will allow you to run the program. But ""no airports in your curent Subscription"" comes up after launching the program. It says you must enter subscription codes in the ""Revision"" module, using the ""Reviev/Expand Subscription"" function. I went there and tried all the codes listed in the word doc but none were accepted. Has anyone else got further than this?"
