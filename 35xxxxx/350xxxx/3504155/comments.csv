,err,2006-07-17T19:09Z,Cheers for the props Gomzi!
,Tcip,2006-07-18T00:27Z,"8.01, does this exist ?"
,Stormstereo,2006-07-18T00:49Z,Does this keygen work with the 8.0.2 update available from the Adobe/Macromedia website?
,err,2006-07-18T02:21Z,Yer it exists man.. It's an installer for version 8 and an update to version 8.01... I just tested the 8.0.2 patch... I installed it over the already installed 8.0.1 version and it worked fine. I haven't tried just using the keygen on an initial install of 8.0.2 but i don't see any problems. Just use this method if it doesn't work.
,Tcip,2006-07-18T02:37Z,err - Do you have a patch for it. I only have a keygen =) where can i find the update for DW? I can't find it on adobe.com ..
,err,2006-07-18T04:29Z,@Tcip.. Here's the link to the updates section of adobe man.. http://www.adobe.com/support/dreamweaver/downloads_updaters.html It's a bitch to find for some reason.. took me awhile to locate it.. 
,Tcip,2006-07-18T05:07Z,err - A BIG thanks!
,err,2006-07-18T05:23Z,@tcip.. No problem at all man!
,Dont_fake_me,2006-07-18T12:10Z,"Hey i have Dreamweaver already on my computer but if i clik it it wont start up , now i download this one and if i Delete the other one It Will Work Or ? Because on the other i have i put the Wrong Serial into it so it wont work any more ;)"
,Stormstereo,2006-07-18T13:54Z,"Cool err, I'll try. Thanks."
,err,2006-07-18T14:14Z,"hmmmm i think you could do with deleting the registry values man. Maybe uninstalling and then using tune up utilities or regcleaner http://www.worldstart.com/weekly-download/archives/reg-cleaner4.3.htm .. That should get rid of all invalid entries, then you can reinstall and use the keygen provided."
,XylenCr3w,2006-07-30T20:57Z,Helt klart överlägset program.
,DirtyCrew,2006-08-08T19:22Z,"well, I had a problem installing it. A popup came up referred to a another install-file and wizard were closed before installing Dreamweaver completely. Whats the problem or am I just a big n00b?"

,ziggy669,2006-10-24T22:48Z,"I had never tried dreamweaver before this but it was a really lame experience. The program actually sucks, it makes changes to your code. In other words this is a program for those who isn't that familiar with html, xhtml, css and php."
