,poincare,2006-07-04T04:03Z,"Video about a loose collection of lunatics ;-) who claim that they have ""evidence"" that the Apollo landings were a huge conspiracy.  Of course, this is all rubbish, easily debunked.  None of the claimants are scientifically trained.  Arguments consist of special pleading, straw men, and outright bad science.  Entertaining if you like to watch wackos flap their gums about something that they know nothing about."
,ravenflt,2006-07-11T02:17Z,We know the lunar landing was fake. Not really a conspiracy anymore.
,boerjelundin,2006-10-25T21:00Z,"Fucking ridiculous!  ""..include photographer/filmmaker David S Percy ARPS and physicist David Groves PhD""  What about the thousand of scientists having examined the lunar samples brought back to earth? 
And, if it was a hoax, why didn't the Soviets tell the world about it? With their radar technology and tracking devices, they would easily have found out if the Apollo craft was merely orbiting the Earth instead of going to the Moon. In fact, the Soviets was able to confirm that the Apollo astronauts had actually landed on the Moon."

Surprisingly many comment made by people that can't have clue of what this film is all about, It there own prejudice they are comment on, no surprise then the seem narrow-minded.

boerjelundin --> You're the one fucking ridiculous! whining about thing you even haven't seen!
""What about the thousand of scientists having examined the lunar samples brought back to earth?""
Yes what about them? Do you know them or their finding, do you that thousand of scientists did test if those rocks really came from them moon or do you know if this film claims there hasn't been any unmanned travel to the moon? Or is just your prejudice speaking?
Your question about the Soviet you would have to ask them about, no one else can know, can they? It would only be speculations. It's Nasa that have to prove they went to the Moon not the other way around, they want the credits for it and they got the money for it."

,eevee,2008-03-04T11:05Z,Here is a web page that refutes the alleged evidence that the moon landing was a hoax: http://www.braeunig.us/space/hoax.htm. You should check it out if you doubt the moon landing took place. 
,sergemck,2008-04-18T19:40Z,"This great documentary was made in 2000. Since then many more anomalies have been uncovered that CONCLUSIVELY prove that the 7 Apollo Missions were pre-staged and pre-recorded fraudulent and criminal deceptions perpetrated by NASA and their CIA/FBI/ Pentagon accomplices. It was a $35 billion scam to enrich numerous NASA business contractors, such as Grumman Corp. It was the true reason why Nixon resigned in 1974 over ""Watergate"": he lost the support of right-wing senators when they were secretly told that the Apollo program was a fake. Taxpayers money is still being wasted in a continuing cover-up by the funding of pro-NASA  stooge web-sites.
To update yourself on the unravelling of this complex criminal deception go to these sites on YouTube: NASASCAM; GREENMAGOOS; MICHAELSTMARK; MOONMOVIES.
You will see for yourself actors kangaroo-hopping, and dangling from springy wires in film studios that exactly duplicate the so-called Apollo moon walks!"
,Feryal32,2008-06-29T02:37Z,"sergemck, you're a lemming. You blindly follow the findings of fringe anti-government types. There are multiple independent findings from serious non-aligned researchers who proved what we have is real. The specific gravity of the moon rocks alone is proof. The type of soil with its micro meter impacts seen only at extreme magnification is another. you can fact photos to an extent now-a-days but it's real hard to produce real samples from an alien place. Besides, my common sense tells me that with all the leaks in our government if this was a hoax we would have heard about it LONG ago. Nice try though."
,Feryal32,2008-06-29T02:52Z,"I have one more stupid question for those that don't believe. If NASA was trying to deceive us why did they do Apollo 13? Why did they make it unsuccessful? I know, they wanted to boost up the ratings. Yeah, that's it. The ratings on TV. Nonsequitor."
,skullfcukyou,2009-02-11T16:37Z,"""Besides, my common sense tells me that with all the leaks in our government if this was a hoax we would have heard about it LONG ago.""

We DID hear about it long ago. This govt is notorious for cover-ups. They may not do a good job but America is too busy watching American Idol than to pay attention to being ass raped.

The if no DEFINITIVE proof the moon landings were real. The verdict is still out imo."
,skullfcukyou,2009-02-11T16:41Z,"""I have one more stupid question for those that don't believe. If NASA was trying to deceive us why did they do Apollo 13? Why did they make it unsuccessful?""

easy answer. During the tv broadcast of apollo 12, people were complaining to the TV networks that re-runs of I love Lucy were being interrupted. So Apollo 13 was designed to get the American's attention again. They wanted to keep getting billions in tax-payer funds because the moon missions were all about weapons development, plain and simple. The people behind the curtain don't care about space exploration you fucking nerd. nor do they care about humanity. profit, war and power is all they care about."

,sonofdog,2009-05-18T22:22Z,"poincare What do you call science if not the careful study of the evidence submitted as fact, which is how those in this program are dealing with this subject. I have had this live image of the lunar landing module taking off in my head for over 30 years. Even though it is not highlighted in this program I have always wondered who they left behind to pan the camera upwards and follow the vehicle ascent. this was not possible at that time.This program is extensive and a must see for those who know that we are lied to constantly and a must for those who are brave enough to face the dreadful reality of the truth - that we are being ruled by corrupt liars and not served by those in power.
There are many programs on this subject. Those that support NASA act almost religiously in their support of apollo, but never provide enough evidence to scientifically deny the claims that this progrom spotlights. But they do now make their programs in HD.
Thanks brooklynman for the upl. But where are the seeders? This should be kept alive at all costs.
@boerjelundin Did you watch this documentary? they clearly explained how the samples were made. They also explain why the soviets were involved. If you have watched this, you and your other friend are clearly part of the disinformation cult, or perhaps you fell asleep or got pissed instead.
@Feryal32 Your question is also answered in this program. Apollo 13 is partly ratings but also the foundation for the space shuttle and the end of lunar hoaxes. We have rocks from the moon because we have sent unmanned samplers not only there, but also to mars and other planets. Man may have gone to the moon. This program does not dispute that, it claims that the man or men who did go to the moon are unsung and probably dead, secret heroes for the elite manipulators of the human consciousness.
I might just up this myself. check out the ""money masters"" and you will understand what's going on. This makes perfect sense in the sick world we live in. Stay informed folks because it is only the truth can get you assassinated, or set you free."
