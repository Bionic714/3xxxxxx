,jalen,2006-07-07T20:27Z,Also subtitled in spanish.
,rainyday,2006-07-08T20:37Z,If you don't understand spoken chinese you better find another copy. There are no subtitles at all here.
,rainyday,2006-07-08T20:57Z,"Correction. WMP can't show the subtitles (english). JetAudio can, but then the audio dissapears. It's your choice - you want to hear or understand what they say? Guess there's a third player that can give you the whole movie. Which one - jalen?"
,rainyday,2006-07-08T21:29Z,"After pouring some sweat on this I found that AC3 filter together with JetAudio made the trick. :)

Thanks jalen for the movie!"
,jalen,2006-07-09T00:10Z,"I'll really recomend to download VLC media player, http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ . Everything included. no needs for codecs etc, wonderful!"
,theBZA,2007-04-26T01:25Z,Anyone want to seed this mofo please?!

I must say the DVD is not great. Picture quality suffers a bit from compression. Ever so slight blocking, grain and blury movement. Though maybe it's just me, poor deinterlacing. I just got glasses and now i spot all the little imperfections ;OP
I was hoping for utter perfection, crystal clear image, some kind of hypervisibility. Hope they end up printing it to bluray eventually like they did Chungking Express, because cinema doesn't get much better than Fa yeung nin wa.

Cheers
