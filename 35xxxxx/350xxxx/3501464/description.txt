Kar-wai Wong's In the mood for love is a very interesting expression of the beauty of love and relationships that goes beyond standards.

The whole point about this movie is the elegant and unique way about how this increasing and strong passion is beautifully described between these two strangers who both have to live with a great deal of disconformities with their spouses in each of their marriages. The story is quite simple but very rich in well-defined details based in an excellent cinematography (Christopher Doyle & Ping Bin Lee), a beautiful score (Mike Gallaso) and a magnificent direction, that all together make the whole movie an unforgettable experience.
