This torrent also contains a scan of the cover art that came with the DVD.

Notes:

This DVD has not been officially released.  Due to each of Robert's films being owned by different companies it is too complicated for him to officially release and distribute a compilation like this.  This disc has been produced without the sanction of these various rights holders, but it is Robert's wish that it be disseminated by any means necessary.  He really wants people to see his work.  The more people that talk about it, the more likely it is that he will be able to receive funding for future projects.  So spread the word!
