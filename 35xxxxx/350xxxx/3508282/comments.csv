,xaviel,2006-08-03T00:08Z,"Ya, a cue file would indeed be nice."
,rudiga,2006-08-08T13:26Z,"romeo86, your a twat mate! you know why, coz you are DOWNLOADING music and then complaining about it! i mean shit, u need a reality check, your luck to be able to do this. 

torrentazos are fucking great i have never found a shit release, and if you are to n00b to know you can mount a .bin file using erm..... any drive emulator you should fuck off! 

For the less rude people if your using deamon tools to mount cd images after selecting the option ""mount image"" choose all files from the file type menu, then find your bin file and bam working like a charm.

Romeo, your just a dick when was the last time you uploaded zero day material???...... thought so."
