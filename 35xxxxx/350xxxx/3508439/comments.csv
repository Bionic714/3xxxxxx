,CrazyFingers,2006-08-08T02:52Z,"Excellent upload, this series is one of the best Sci-Fi out there.  
Is Disc 4 coming any time soon?
Also, a DVDDecrypter/DVDShrink(or similar) .iso file would be easier for most people to download and burn to DVD, just a thought."

CCE encoded movies are far better encoded than crappy DVDShrink"
