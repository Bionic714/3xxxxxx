,ksoktogon,2006-07-13T23:23Z,Hmmm... Really impressive amount! Not too much to seed?
,Unnamed1,2006-07-13T23:34Z,"not realy, i am sitting with a 10/10 Mbit connection and I can seed 42,75 GB in about 12 hours:D"
,astaldo,2006-07-14T09:53Z,Thanks for this one Unnamed1 :)

Thank you"
,Nightowl247,2006-07-14T19:31Z,"IÂ´m seeding from a 10/10 Mbit as well, so please seed! I will seed until my ratio is 2-3:1. If we all did that the Pirate Bay would be a better place!"
,Hampaman70,2006-07-15T16:11Z,What a morronic thing to do! couldn't you partition it?
,Unnamed1,2006-07-15T16:14Z,"well dumbass, you can choose wich files you want to dowload!, or cant you?
so before writing stupid-posts you should know what you are talking about...."
,adavis12,2006-07-15T21:47Z,"please can u tell me how u encoded these dvd's, was it dvd-rb cce"
,Unnamed1,2006-07-15T22:45Z,"adavis12, It wasnt I who encoded this, I am not a part or a member of this group, so I cant tell you how this was done."
,mepirate,2006-07-22T19:36Z,WoW! Thank you! :o)
,Mr_Zos,2006-08-08T23:27Z,can say for 100 % is encoded with CCe...
,PhoeniX726,2006-09-01T09:24Z,"also thanks to above person, seeding 50% to me single handedly :D"

//thelolkiller"
[V],Qitty,2006-12-18T12:03Z,Thanks for this one!
,BadSwe,2006-12-23T10:30Z,Fucking useless.... im gettin 20 kbit.... and 1 of 8 seeders..seed. MY up/dw-rate after 12 hours.. 1.8.. And i got 25 proc of disc 1... IT SUCKS!
,andregcasal,2006-12-29T12:37Z,"Another thanks for the original seeder and those who contributed for the torrent. Great work and great movie :)

Watch your language m8's."
,SysGhost,2007-01-03T13:09Z,"Whenever I'm able to finish this one, I will seed it for an unknown amount of time. In other words, I will seed it as long as my servers is alive and around, and my servers are some good'ol rock-steady things."
,Kosinus1,2007-01-07T02:14Z,Great SysGhost because I intend to dl it soon when I get enough disk space. ;)
,SysGhost,2007-01-07T02:32Z,"I'm on 86 % now, and the current download rate is around 100 kilobyte / sec

My current upload is 49 kilobyte / sec out of available 125 kilobyte/sec

I hope more will join as longtime seeders on this one."
,SysGhost,2007-01-08T02:30Z,"100%

...and is now seeding!"
,PepitaK,2007-01-10T17:29Z,"I'm getting 2kB/s, does anyone know why? I've shut down all my other dl's so they wouldn't affect this download. It's gonna take years to dl this at this speed..."
,runkill.com,2007-01-26T06:31Z,i wish i could find the entire animatrix in a 700mb avi file like it used to be. it was great quality for its size
,SysGhost,2007-01-31T16:06Z,"A few more seeders on this one would be great.
I'm still seeding and I have allowed an maximum upload rate at 50 kbyte / sec 

... well... 

I do want to use my own connection for other things aswell, so thats what I can give 24/7

Anyhow, I can confirm that it's worth it, if you want the Matrix collection of course. 
DVD isofiles, unpack, burn onto a single layer DVD media (approx 4Gbyte) and watch. No hickups at all."
,PepitaK,2007-02-01T08:19Z,"Took me 17 days and one hour to dl this... I'll keep seeding at least until my ratio is above 2, hope it helps :)"
,Kosinus1,2007-02-03T00:27Z,I started my download now. Please seed as much as possible! Sharing is caring. :D
,acenorth,2007-02-07T07:56Z,"Thank you for this torrent. 
I am now at 56% and uploading at 750-1,2 Mbit to others. If I get this 100% i will continue for a couple of days. 
I am only receiving at 60-100 kbit so it would be nice if others could pitch in and not leave as soon as youre finished. 
Thank you!"
,acenorth,2007-02-10T08:20Z,100% and seeding at 1 Mbit+. Will continue to a 10.1 ratio then I need my line to other things. Thank you all.
,Kosinus1,2007-02-12T16:53Z,"Completed 100% and seeding. It took 9.5 days, I think this is a pretty decent time. Thank you all!"
,MarkuzQ,2007-03-02T11:18Z,Is this Widescreen or FS?
,Kosinus1,2007-03-15T09:01Z,"WS. Well, maybe some documentaries are FS but the movies are WS."

,Kraxl,2007-03-30T01:02Z,"Thanks, but you really should unrar files before you upload them as torrents! There is no reason to rar files unless for FTP."
,KoolDane,2008-03-24T00:05Z,Thanks a lot!!
,caspmik,2008-03-25T22:31Z,"plz keep seeding.. just startet DL, and when done, i'll keep on seeding for a week or two, so! pleace keep seeding!!


sharing is caring!!"
,caspmik,2008-03-25T22:37Z,"well.. acording to my prog, it will take me about more than 3 full days of DL, so the more we all seed the faster the rest will dl.."

,bergflex,2008-10-09T16:12Z,"hey guys this is lame. please seed.

,bergflex,2008-12-10T14:16Z,tried to download this stuff. never got over 40% and had a ration of 6. suggest this torrent instead http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3642812/The_Matrix_Ultimate_Collection_(10_DVD9)_(http___en.wikipedia.or
,i_c_c,2008-12-14T13:04Z,"This is THE MATRIX MOTHERLOAD!  Gentlemen and Ladies, I'm sure it is difficult, and you think you are taxing your system, but IF YOU CAN SPEND THE TIME TO RETRIEVE THE FILE, YOU CAN SPARE THE TIME TO GIVE THE FILE. 	
SI VOUS POUVEZ PASSER LE TEMPS DE TELECHARGER LE FICHIER, VOUS POUVEZ EPARGNER LE TEMPS DE DONNER LE FICHIER. Certainly you will continue to tax your system with subsequent leeching of other torrents, why not continue seeding for the rest of the community?"
,sicpixi,2009-04-20T03:48Z,thanks for the up!
,gtiwari,2009-12-01T11:25Z,"Friends atleast one person can continue to seed. kindly don't just download but also share. We need seeders. Thanks
We give more, We get more. Thats all we are here for."
,T.T.C,2010-04-05T23:39Z,IT IS STUCK AT 99%!!!
,gtiwari,2010-05-10T19:39Z,I have again started to Seed.I have first 7 Disks and need to download last 3 disks. Hopefully I can help others complete the download of first 7 disks. Keep Seeding guys
,alex0008,2010-09-20T14:36Z,"We could really use a seed.
Thanks a lot to any that come :)"
,Sepiatoned,2011-03-04T02:51Z,do the movies have the audio commentaries on them?
,HKt0p5,2011-04-12T21:14Z,"WHOA! Great treasure~
Since I see though it's quite big and low on seeds, does your collection have the ""The Matrix Recalibrated"" making-of documentary somewhere in there? I need it..BADLY. XD"
,annuit02,2011-10-23T17:06Z,I got to forty percent done but then there were no more seeders. I can seed for an indefinite amount of time but  I need all the parts first. Please seed!
,iLirian,2012-01-26T14:19Z,someone seed please. im stuck at 99.2%. Comeone. please.
