,PopArt,2006-07-21T18:30Z,"Cool, a new challenge ;-)"
,frostycab,2006-07-21T21:21Z,"Yes, this is Flight Deck Companion: Live Cockpit, published by Aerosoft.

Popart, you asked me for this ages ago, but not been online to upload it since, so hope you can get it going, as I'd like to be able to use it.

Best of luck guys!"
,wilista,2006-07-21T21:25Z,"i would like have this stuff, thanks and hope that someone can make a crack for this. 

Also i'm asking for seeding this, meanwhile there is no seeding by frostycab

Regardsm wilista"
,The_Hangar_18,2006-07-21T22:01Z,lol PopArt ^^ whish luck :)
,frostycab,2006-07-22T00:56Z,"I *am* seeding this right now, but occasionally I have to stop for 30 minutes to reboot and do other stuff.  I will continue to seed until there are at least 5 other seeds, or until I go home in 10 days, whichever comes first.

Hope it works"
,frostycab,2006-07-22T10:26Z,"Sorry, can't help you there. I don't have it."
,frostycab,2006-07-22T15:02Z,"Oooh, lovely! Will try the code at once.

Cheers mate!"
,LuigiLucheni,2006-07-22T22:09Z,can someone please upload the update to version 3? Thanks alot!
,PopArt,2006-07-23T04:39Z,"If the code doen't work, I have it cracked ;-)

Anyways, thanks to both!"
,LuigiLucheni,2006-07-23T05:44Z,"the code works well, only the software is version 2 and to be up to date you need the update to version 3... "
,LuigiLucheni,2006-07-23T05:58Z,"yes, there is, but for this version update you need the update from aerosoft, which is in their restriced area, and I can log their in, because I haven't  bought the product... "
,StealthFighter80,2006-07-23T07:52Z,Req: Wilco 737PIC
,LuigiLucheni,2006-07-23T16:11Z,"the rpoblem is, you can't update the product from the program itself, you have to go to the aerosoff homepage and download it there - and then you have to register ther poduct there, before you can download it... so I can't download this update, perhaps someone else has it and can upload it?"
,LuigiLucheni,2006-07-24T16:17Z,"here you are... http://aerosoft-shop2.com/support.php?language=en
