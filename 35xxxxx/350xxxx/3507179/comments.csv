[T],WinstonSmith6079,2006-07-28T06:39Z,"Heh, NO, there are seeds, and NO, that's not the same files.  This one is easier to manage and is better.  From an original CD-ROM, it's just the game (in a mere two files) and nothing else, without a lotta other, extra usleless crap in it."
,Snapix,2006-09-24T07:58Z,Nope... No seeds. =/
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2006-09-26T18:37Z,"When and if this torrent dies, I guess I'll just make a new one and re-seed the game.  (I'll probably .ZIP or .RAR the CD image that time too.)  But this page right now--at the time I write this--says Seeders: 3."

,fiendsin,2012-04-04T18:21Z,"when i try to run a mission pack for examp: scourge of armagon, it say i need registered version, how to fix that?"
,malcumsquirt,2012-07-17T13:23Z,"This torrent is trash! GLQuake refuses to work. First I install everything, I click on the icon, then I get an error message ""glide2x.dll is not on your computer,"" so I go online and download said .dll file. I try to start GLQuake once again. This time it doesn't ask me for the .dll file. Instead I get at least 3 different error messages, the screen turns black, then the game crashes.

Quake for windows seems to work okay, but it doesn't give me the option for mouselook. Well, in the controls listing it says press mouse 3 or backslash to activate mouselook, but that doesn't work for shit. 

Thanks for contributing to wasting my monthly allowance of bandwidth."
,ajarov,2012-07-29T21:19Z,"The version of GL Quake included in this torrent doesn't work on my PC (Win7 64-bit).
I play on the one from this torrent: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4055470 while leaving this one mounted with Daemon Tools on the FIRST drive to play with the music."
