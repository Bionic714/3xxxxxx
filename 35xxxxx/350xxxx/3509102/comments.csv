,Lobaloba,2006-08-01T11:50Z,"I havent seen anyone else but ""Thin Lizzy"" that seeds Thin Lizzy, So that makes them rare... Keep em coming... I admit that some stuff I already have but who cares i want more! And to Mister Monroe I would like to say... Do you want some cheese with that wine?"
,Lord DINGDING,2006-08-01T12:00Z,"thanks for all dvd`s ThinLizzy
i got a pm from ""ThinLizzy"" in wich he said that it would be 12 dvd`s, so this should be the last one."
,bengan_68,2006-08-02T08:08Z,Do you think its smart to name your file Thin Lizzy when its the stinking group Dare... Wasted some time on this one...
,dredawg,2006-08-02T16:25Z,no shit... who wants to hear butt-rock like Dare??  I thought I was getting real music like Thin Lizzy.... what a stupid thing to name a torrent!
,Ahvad,2006-08-08T14:52Z,"Thank you very much for all the lovely dvd`s!!!
