,speechrecognition,2006-07-16T16:40Z,serial or crack inlcuded? thanks.
,hdtom,2006-07-16T19:54Z,"poor thing this exhibtis.com. what are the ""cookies enabled"" good for? why do you have to register for simple browsing? malware installers?"
,joakimar,2006-07-17T05:18Z,"This is stupid. You can download this freely from the source. What would be handy is the serial number though. See another torrent here tpb for that, but that file doesn't seem to be seeded."
,J Sparrow,2006-07-17T08:14Z,"THE SERIAL NUMBER FOR THIS IS 
0020N-AOOWU-XDSMN-5TYGT-QQSU5"
,JNaas,2006-07-17T16:11Z,"i quote ""The activation key seems to be invalid!""
"
,J Sparrow,2006-07-18T03:43Z,"THE SERIAL NUMBER IS
002ON-AOOWU-XDSMN-5TYGT-QQSU5"
,judas6000,2006-07-18T10:43Z,"Again Sparrow, that key just gives the message ""The activation key seems to be invalid!""  Can somebody please come up with a valid key. Thanks"
,zka.kisochra,2006-07-18T21:44Z,Maybe the password is specific to the user name the product was registered with?  just a thought
,judas6000,2006-07-18T22:57Z,"I had thought that kisochra, so maybe if Sparrow could give the username and company name he used witht he activatin key, that might work."
,J Sparrow,2006-07-19T06:27Z,user name is akram
,zka.kisochra,2006-07-19T08:44Z,I was successful; note that you must delete the dashes inbetween the groups of numbers in the serial in order for it to fit in the appropriate box. 
,judas6000,2006-07-21T23:55Z,"Use the second serial number that sparrow posted, 002ON-AOOWU-XDSMN-5TYGT-QQSU5 without the dashes so it becomes 
002ONAOOWUXDSMN5TYGTQQSU5
this then works with the user name Akram"
,LayZAss2I,2006-08-19T00:43Z,Is Parallels really only 23.33 MiB?  
,joe roxy,2006-08-26T12:29Z,"is it necessary to download this version with the key, or can ik download the trial version from the site and then fill in the key there, will that work too?"
,judas6000,2006-09-06T12:14Z,"You can download the trial from the website then fill in the key, that would work too.  And yes Parallels really is only 23Mb"
,punker9000,2006-10-11T01:11Z,ok 2QURV-6V5ZW-UOOHR-GT11F-RTPI9  is a working serial without any user name

,seekn_destroy,2006-11-08T22:24Z,"Hello guys, I'm a new macuser, what are the differances between bootcamp and parallels? is it possible to run exe-files in parallels? or is it any other way to make this possible, it is OK to answer in swedish if you like... "
,Brocccoli,2006-11-11T14:25Z,Everytime I turn mine on the thing ask me for a email adress and password
,Brocccoli,2006-11-11T14:35Z,Does anyone have CrossOver things I want that to work plz.....Thanks for all hard effort

,Dent76,2007-01-05T01:51Z,"Hmm IT WORKS GREAT BUT... I cant seem to get it to work with programs like dc or torrent, well it works ofc but THE PORTS ARE ALL SHOWN AS CLOSED or maybe non existing. Anybody have an idea of how to make the ports seam open for the VM?"
,mac_davis,2007-01-16T04:23Z,"The difference between Bootcamp and Parallels is that Bootcamp is the (at current) official Mac beta. Wheras Parallels can run two operating systems simultaneously, Bootcamp can only run one at a time, which needs a system restart.

Parallels is generally said to be ""better"" than Bootcamp. When Leopard 10.5 comes out, Bootcamp is projected to be out of beta and packaged with more features."
,dacheat,2007-01-24T23:31Z,"This works great, Ty, What I found easier than downloading the torrent was to go the the parallels site, download the full demo, and use one of vsimon's activation codes (thank man)"
,scunky,2007-02-10T15:42Z,"gamers forget it!!
parallels can only use a very basic graphics driver
so directx and openGL stuff just wont work."
,filterfind,2007-05-25T20:59Z,hmm... what cd do i need to use to install a windows xp VM? not sure if i still have my installation cds...
,TrenTech,2008-02-21T04:13Z,Will this work with Hackintosh?
,trudank,2008-04-03T21:19Z,"Hey im a new mac user, and when i try to start using the parallels virtual machine my screen freezes and a notice says i need to restart my computer...i figured yall might know what's up?"
,prot93,2009-12-08T23:04Z,This doesn't seem to work with Snowleopard
