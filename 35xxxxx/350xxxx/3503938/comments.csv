,moracca,2007-03-30T05:21Z,"For the life of me I cannot understand why you people upload albums in a single rar file.  I'm pretty sure we can handle the extra 5 mb bandwidth that compressing it saves.  It prevents people from downloading a single song they might be looking for -- or from not downloading songs they already have.  Just upload the mp3's!!!

btw I don't mean to sound ungrateful, because I do appreciate it being uploaded, I just can't understand the logic"
