Plz seed all of the file...."
,MisanthropeMojo,2006-07-14T05:04Z,"Completed all episodes thanx prde! Will be seeding for awhile. 
I never thought I'd ever complete this download. In fact I deleted parts 1 & 2 before thinking I wouldn't complete the series. 
This is what torrents are all about access to rare material you can't rent or buy in your area. "
