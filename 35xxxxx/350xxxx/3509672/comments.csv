,COrava,2006-08-06T05:45Z,Hopefully this stays seeded long enough that I get my new hard drive... :P
,nanaem,2006-08-06T10:11Z,"holy crap, 82.99 GiB   :D   must be the biggest torrent i've seen seeded at once at TPB. good luck    :)"
,KimK,2006-08-06T13:26Z,"Yeah, It´s quite big. =) It took some time to generate this one. :D"
,KimK,2006-08-06T13:56Z,"BTW, You are VERY welcome to seed the biggest torrent on TPB. =) I´ll seed as much as I can, but if  others do it as well, this could be a great torrent! :D "
,tspse,2006-08-06T20:29Z,"TV Torrent got them all, and have MORE seeders.

,KimK,2006-08-07T12:45Z,"Mupp_gonzo: Yeah, I realized that. sorry.
Wizzard: If you seed at all, I´ll should be thanking you.=)"
,Cynips,2006-08-09T01:41Z,"Ok, I'm in :D"
,KimK,2006-08-12T21:00Z,"I´m just wondering, is the download-speed reasonable for you guys? or is it like 2kbit/s? =)"
,riku123,2006-08-13T14:08Z,"Well, 2kb/s is not so reasonable with torrent this size. 65h and 5,8%. So if you can do something about the speed, please do so, otherwise it´s going to take a year to get this."
,KimK,2006-08-13T14:24Z,"I´ll try. I am seeding almost all the time, so I don´t think there´s much I can do. So everyone, here comes a cliché; PLEASE SEED. ;)"
,TheWaltz,2006-08-15T21:01Z,"These torrents overlap and can be used to complete season 1-3:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3506396/Stargate_SG-1_Season_2
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3506397/Stargate_SG-1_Season_3

I dont know why my SG-Atlantis files are not accepted as complete, they are exactly the same size. Maybe KimK changed the Files in some detail?!"
,KimK,2006-08-16T22:15Z,"Nope, I havent done anything with the files. or I changed the name of every one to provide easier browsing. "
,Rogue_1,2006-09-06T23:18Z,Is this still being seeded at all? And what audio codec do these videos use? Thanks.
,oceanofdarkstars,2006-09-08T09:42Z,"Hey Could Someone Maybe Mail this To Me Seeing As How I Have The Crappiest Dial-Up Con

,miki_a,2006-10-02T04:09Z,"SG1 and ""Star Gate Atlantis"" are different TV shows for the same theme :)"
,obiwanbill,2006-11-21T01:51Z,"Wow, this looks like a complete torrent but I have a few questions for KimK or anybody else who has downloaded this ...

1. Are all these seasons DVD rips?
2. What pixel resolution are they?
3. I prefer no Subtitles, is that the case here?
4. Has anybody had a chance to watch all of the episodes in this torrent? If so, are there any problems with this torrent? (Ya I know, its a lot of work to watch them all, but I haven't seen all of Seasons 1 - 8 so I was just wondering before I download this).

Thanks for your info, in advance.
