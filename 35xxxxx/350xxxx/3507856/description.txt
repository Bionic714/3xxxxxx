These are the best I could find.

Bar #39 - it opens small, has small file size & has mediocre resolution. But it is readable. Just not good enough. Will reupload torrent when I find a better copy.

What I mean is, all are scanned nicely, really clear. 
They open and scroll well - some I came accross didn't. 
They open to fill the full window of Acrobat or Foxit - others didn't.

They are all full issues - they are not articles/sections taken from various issues.
