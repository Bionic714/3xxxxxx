(Please note that I'm a one-man-band operation, doing all recording / ripping,
encoding and seeding, so don't expect me to upload things forever - at some
points I do like to browse the web at full speed, or get e-mail, for example 
- however, if there is such demand for it and nobody else can seed it, I'll
be happy to consider seeding whatever file it is for a while =P)
