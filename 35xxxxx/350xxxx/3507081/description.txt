SGOOPE is the cool alternative to Skype.

Free softphone! IP phone!

It is a small program that allows you to call landlines, cell phone, IP phones, Skype  users and of course SGOOPE users for FREE!

The program is developed by a danish company call Call-IT. It has been well received in Denmark and is waiting for its break-thru internationally.

I thought I would share it with you guys. I believe this will make Skype a little worried :-)

The deal is as follows:

Download the program (either here or at www.sgoope.com)
Install
Create account

Now you can begin making calls (mobile, landline, whatever...) You have FREE talktime to every call you make. You earn talktime by making Skype or SGOOPE calls (pure IP calls) this earn talktime can be used to finance even more talktime to landline/cell phone.

You may ask "This is too good to be true..."
But it isn't!

They finance your free talktime by showing a few adds while you are talking.
Then you probably say "isnt that disturbing?"
- actually no - its only a few to every call!

"but then my computer gets all kinds of spyware adware ect..."
- NO! They would have the kind of succes they have in Denmark if this was adware/spyware! I personally garantee that its save to install :-)

Really guys - check it out, its worth it!

Works all over the world!
