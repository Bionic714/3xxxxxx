,2008Torrenter,2009-01-02T09:12Z,"""Install our release like normal and make sure to install the MUI Pack from WPI""

First it says that i need to install it normally, then it says i need to install it from WPI, which to my knowledge isnt 'normal'

So which is it, normally or with WPI, and if its with WPI, what is it and how do i install with it?

Jag har Windows XP Professional SP3. Unzipade bara filen och klickade på installationsfilen. Installerade och gick in i kontrollpanelen vidare till språkinställningar som det står i instruktionerna i beskrivningen.
