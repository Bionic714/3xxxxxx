Windows XP Multilingual User Interface Pack
===========================================

The MUI Pack allows each user of a workstation to select one of the installed User Interface languages
This selection is then stored in their user profile
When a user logs on, the appearance of the system change to the selected language

We have put the following languages in our release :

Arabic
Danish
Dutch
Finnish
French
German
Italian
Portuguese
Russian
Spanish
Swedish
Turkish

So in short, it means that you can change our english XP to ANY of the languages listed above

Here is a quick example on how this works :

Install our release like normal and make sure to install the MUI Pack from WPI

When everything is installed and your pc has rebooted do the following :

- Click Start > Controlpanel

- Click on "Date, Time, Language, and Regional Options"

- click on "Add Other Languages" or "Regional and Language options" and a small window will pop up
 
- first tab "Regional Options" fill in your country

- second tab "Languages" choose your own language

- third tab "Advanced" optional (just leave as is)

Next hit apply and ok etc and reboot your pc again. Your windows will now be in your own language

==============
Special Note :
==============

MUI can take up to 15-30 minutes to install

If you just want to install your own language in stead of all of them do this :

- Skip the MUI install from WPI
- Upon first reboot go to the dvd by right clicking on it and select open
- Browse to the folder "Retestrak/MUI
- Double click MUISETUP.EXE
- Install your own language and your done
- Dont forget to reboot ;)
