\"REVOLUTION OS tells the inside story of the hackers who rebelled against the proprietary software model and Microsoft
to create GNU/Linux and the Open Source movement.

On June 1, 2001, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said \"Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.\"
Microsoft fears GNU/Linux, and rightly so. GNU/Linux and the Open Source & Free Software movements arguably represent the greatest threat to Microsoft\'s
way of life.
Shot in cinemascope on 35mm film in Silicon Valley, REVOLUTION OS tracks down the key movers and shakers behind Linux,
and finds out how and why Linux became such a potent threat.
 
REVOLUTION OS features interviews with Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman, Bruce Perens, Eric Raymond, Brian Behlendorf, Michael Tiemann,
Larry Augustin, Frank Hecker, and Rob Malda. \"
