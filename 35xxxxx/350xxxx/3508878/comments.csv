,Fold Em,2006-07-31T17:19Z,"LOL!! 
This will doo just find. Thank you very very much!!"
,Cornflower,2006-07-31T22:34Z,"I really don't want to be rude, but... I've been leeching all day and only gotten 5%. This way I won't get 100% before the next race. Are you super-seeding (fools the statistics) or seeding with low bandwidth?"
,quamox,2006-08-01T09:14Z,This torrent is dead!! everyone's stuck at 4.8% Does anyone know where else I can find this race??
,Cornflower,2006-08-01T12:41Z,"It's working now, although at somewhat low speed. Nevertheless, it works! Thank you."
,Messerschmitt,2006-08-01T12:43Z,The speed is slow because well... I don't have the luxury of bandwith
,Cornflower,2006-08-01T12:48Z,I found another torrent at demonoid. I'll see if it works.
,Cornflower,2006-08-01T12:50Z,"I can't post the link, I get database error, but here, I think you can figure it out:
demonoid dot com slash files slash details slash 413310 slash 977724"
,quamox,2006-08-01T16:01Z,"That's better, the seeder is back, long live the seeder! Thanks!!"
,berto15,2006-08-03T03:26Z,"Can I ask for invite to demoniod?

,Fold Em,2006-08-03T16:59Z,"Thx. Messerschmitt. 
It works just great. 
Are u going to upload the next race? That would be super great.
Thanx"
,Messerschmitt,2006-08-04T08:36Z,"I will if people are interested, more people were rather upset given my upload speed and availability. "
,Fold Em,2006-08-04T13:43Z,"Im very interested. I think it was great. the Swedish comments sucks anyway :) The speed worked just find for me. And i really prefer the entire coverage.
