,loymo,2008-05-20T08:47Z,"this is what the anual to getting the game to work says
 1. Rozpakowujesz gre do katalogu (np: C:\park)
2. Instalujesz DOSBox0.65
3. Uruchamiasz DosBox
  - Wpisujesz w konsoli: mount c c:\park\
  - nastêpnie wpisujesz: c:
  - a nasêpnie: tp
4. Ustawiasz CPU Cycles wciskaj¹c lewy ctr+F12 (gra najlepiej dziala przy ustawieniu domyslnym czyli ok 3 tys.)
5. Lewy alt+enter daje Fullscreen.

Gra jest w 100% sprawna.

this is what i translated but still cant understand anyone help me??

1. You unpack for catalog ( gre e.g. ) 2 C:park. You fit 3 DOSBox0.65. You start up DosBox you inscribe in console - mount c c:park - & # 234 nast; you inscribe trunks c - but & # 234; trunk < climb > 4 tp. Put drive in & # 185 CPU Cycles; at setup left < lev > + ( play < game > best c ctr F12 dziala domyslnym or ok 3 thousand ) 5. Alto gives left < lev > + enter Fullscreen. Game is proficient in (to) 100%."

,Fuzzymannerz,2008-06-14T16:10Z,"Here's some instructions I just wrote to get it to work...

1. Extract the rar file to ""C:\""
2. Install the ""DOSBox0.65-win32-installer.exe"" file
3. Run ""DOSBox"" from the start menu.
4. Once running type (Without quotes) ""mount c c:\park""
5. Press enter.
6. now type ""c:"" and press enter again.
7. now type ""tp""
8. Game will load and run.

Hope this helps some of you."
,stephany_g,2008-07-13T12:08Z,"Question: 
I understand that i can set de sound & music by typing ""setup"" in the dosbox. But can anyone tell me why the settings don't save? please help playing without musicis kind of borring."
,TPON,2009-07-08T03:59Z,does this work with vista? i seem to have no way of entering a backslash for the mount?
,cassarie2,2009-11-09T23:38Z,"loymo, here is a complete translation.

this is what the annual The Game is getting to work says 
1. Unpack the game to a directory (eg C: \ park) 
2. Installing DOSBox0.65 
3. You run DosBox 
- You type in console: mount c c: \ park \ 
- Then type: c: 
- And nasêpnie: tp 
4. You set the CPU Cycles push ¹ c left ctr + F12 (the game works best with the default setting that is about 3 thousand). 
5. Left alt + enter gives Fullscreen. 

The game is 100% efficient."
