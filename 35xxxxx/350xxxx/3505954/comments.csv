HERETIC!!!! That gruff voice just has so much character.....

(I bet you say Bob Dylan can't sing either, eh?)"

Blahblahblah, your just kind of a pretentious lad, who probably likes what he writes himself...

Maybe get humble, that what cale is all about: just music, nice atmosphere, and no mumbo jumbo.

If you want to sound critical, you may write something like this: (I listened to thw whole nice set)

Nice concert, too bad j.j.'s voice is not properly balanced in the mix - quite a band is having most of the volume.

I suspect this is ripped of the concert DVD..."
