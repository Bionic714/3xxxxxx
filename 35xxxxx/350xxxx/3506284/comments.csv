The other post with a crack who is good for only 50% of users and released with no warning about the prob!!!

But u are a mega flamer!

I test it here on 2 machines, and when its works here, why should i assume that it not work @ other machines?

And yes, its 1.1"
,The_Hangar_18,2006-07-23T11:18Z,"sorry, i dont know its 1.1, in this moment i had the C130 in mind, she is 1.1 ^^"

LAGO MG21 = bullshit
Use CS MG21UM, much closer to real (confirmed by former MG21 pilot)"
,fabula,2006-07-23T13:46Z,"Kris:

Same here, I thought it was because of language change but obviously not."
,The_Hangar_18,2006-07-23T14:13Z,"just make your window smaller, not fullscreen. Then u can reach your messages."
,gusty987,2006-07-23T17:54Z,"belga1, 

there is nothing wrong with hangar's uploads, they all work fine for 99 percent of people. Don't cry to the uploaders if a product won't work on your fucked up computer if it works for everyone else."
,gusty987,2006-07-23T17:57Z,"Request:

Radar Contact v. 4"
,StealthFighter80,2006-07-23T18:17Z,"Thanks Hangar,not suspicious at all,my system loves your uploads!LOL"
,skaneskogen,2006-07-23T18:23Z,"What do I have to do to see the main panel. The VC is there but not the main panel.....???????????
Thanks a lot..."
,fabula,2006-07-23T18:23Z,"Nice uploads you do Hangar!

If anyone would consider reseeding PSS Dash and/or FlyTampa Vienna Schwechat I would appreciate it, thanks!"
,gusty987,2006-07-23T18:24Z,captainsim has not released the 2D panel yet i believe
,fabula,2006-07-23T18:41Z,"In fact they have had, but it is not of such a big quality.

I would go for Lonny Payne panel @avsim.net"
,gusty987,2006-07-23T18:43Z,"ah ok thanks fabula, didn't know that. I guess there is still no FMS though...

And another request...

Could someone please reseed FlightScenery FlightZone 01 Rhode Island (KPVD) thanks."
,StealthFighter80,2006-07-23T19:12Z,"@Gusty,just go to Flight1.com and download the wrapper there,and then use Wildman's Flight1 WrapperCrack package here on TPB,and thats it."
,fabula,2006-07-23T19:28Z,"I didnt realise those were going on F1 wrappers, thankf for good tip!"

,Panodilo,2006-07-23T19:48Z,"Thanks for this, sugar nuts. As for the aircraft package, it's a premature release on Cap's part. This modular approach just doesn't work for an aircraft. It's as if they are masturbating, rubbing themselves and congratulating each other on the very attractive animations and what not."
,gusty987,2006-07-23T20:00Z,"lol panadilo I agree the modules thing is stupid

and thanks for the tip stealthfighter"
[T],stevekasian,2006-07-24T00:19Z,"Anyone know what the deal is with the other Captain Sim 757 that was uploaded here a month or so back? I can't find it now cuz search is down, but it's 550.96MB in size, and everyone's stuck on 97.5% for the past few weeks.

Big size difference there - anyone know why?
SK"
,StealthFighter80,2006-07-24T00:49Z,"@stevekasian,these are only version 1.0,and the one in the other F*****ers package was 1.1;)"
,boeing777,2006-07-24T13:05Z,stevekasian: The 550mb pack includes all the blocks and tons of repaints for the models. In that pack all the installers are of version 1.1 but the seed is stuck at 97.5%. Wish someone could reseed the 550mb 757 package.
