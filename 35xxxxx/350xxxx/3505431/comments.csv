,Jackass Jimm,2006-08-06T04:29Z,"Seed guys.  Help seed.  I can't do it on my own.  

From the 15 - 25 people that have the full copies, I only see 0 -2 seeders on (with 1 being me).  

Sacrafice other torrents and upload these valuable and informational vids."
,Jackass Jimm,2006-09-17T00:55Z,"Davethenave has left us to fend for ourselves and most probably won't upload anymore (he left disk 7 at 47% and disk 8 at 6%)...

I am growing weary of uploading constantly. I've been uploading since June. So, I'll be stopping my seeding of this series (disk 1 - 6) on September 31st. Seriously, no one seeds here. I think there was a time when I saw like 2 other seeders...for like half a week.

Well, anyway, just wanted to inform you...so make sure you put as much priority into these torrents."
,davethenave,2007-02-07T05:42Z,"As of Feb 7 2007


I see 201.221.157.146 has 20% of this file


I'm doing my part to fill in missing parts. Then I'll upload the rest of the 25 set mp4 files.


Help me.


After you get a complete file leave it on for share."
,trask24 ,2007-02-11T02:00Z,Dave are you teaching in Thailand?
,Jackass Jimm,2007-03-22T06:55Z,"I kept on seeding them even I after I posted. Not as much but I would seed.

Anyway, now that DavetheNave is back, I'll try to seed as much as possible. Though I have a lot of catching up to do since all the new discs (9 - 18, sans 17) are at 0 %.....but I should get those in time.

Good luck all in getting these files and please seed as much as possible. I've even increased my upload speed and am paying around $100 a month just so I could seed these files better.

Help keep the help going."

This video course is much better than the Live class offered by TEFLINTERNATIONAL.

Thanks to Dave Hopkins for lending the DVD's.

Without his help this posting of the course would not be possible."

Same as above - sent through GSpace in files approx 9meg, split using GSplit, with an *.exe that will recompile them when all finished dowloading.

As suggested to me by davethenave, I've set up some accounts just to keep these files in, then I can easily send them to others, or download them to any computer with Internet access! Works for me!! (you'll need 3 accounts if this is what you want to do, too!!)

If you are using Utorrent as your file share, highlight each file, double click then paste the above trackers.

The video course torrent files were created more than a year ago. It only has one tracker for pirate bay and is no longer recommended. Add all of the above trackers will make a big difference for connected peers and download speed.

,daveshelper,2008-01-06T03:37Z,"Thank you:

All who  seed this series of 25 disk. It's a long list and large files.

I'm asking your help. 

Please... After you complete a download Leave it to seed until a couple more people can take your place.

I've tried off and on for more than a year to make this teaching course available.

This is my last run. 

I'll be off the net in a couple of weeks. 

It's up to you whether these torrents live or die."

Recode this teaching English course to .3gp files.  They will then be under 50 meg file size and play on any mobile phone.

Re- seed these files in .3gp .
