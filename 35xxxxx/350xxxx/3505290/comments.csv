If you download it, seed.  I seed whenever I can (meaning most of the time...as long as there isn't a blackout nor me playing online...).

Just leave these uploading and then download whatever files you want.  Sure, your download speeds won't be as good but seed and help out.  Me, witha  384/256 connection is helping...you guys with the big upload speeds (768 or 1.5) gotta get on and help.  There are at least 15 - 20 guys that have finished each torrent and there are only 0 - 2 seeders on always.

Help spread these.  Sacrafice your downloads (toa  certain extent) and just help out.

,Jackass Jimm,2006-09-17T00:56Z,"Davethenave has left us to fend for ourselves and most probably won't upload anymore (he left disk 7 at 47% and disk 8 at 6%)...

I am growing weary of uploading constantly. I've been uploading since June. So, I'll be stopping my seeding of this series (disk 1 - 6) on September 31st. Seriously, no one seeds here. I think there was a time when I saw like 2 other seeders...for like half a week.

Well, anyway, just wanted to inform you...so make sure you put as much priority into these torrents."

,Jackass Jimm,2007-03-22T06:53Z,"I kept on seeding them even I after I posted.  Not as  much but I would seed.

Anyway, now that DavetheNave is back, I'll try to seed as much as possible.  Though I have a lot of catching up to do since all the new discs (9 - 18, sans 17) are at 0 %.....but I should get those in time.

Good luck all in getting these files and please seed as much as possible.  I've even increased my upload speed and am paying around $100 a month just so I could seed these files better.

Help keep the help going."

Same as above - sent through GSpace in files approx 9meg, split using GSplit, with an *.exe that will recompile them when all finished dowloading.

As suggested to me by davethenave, I've set up some accounts just to keep these files in, then I can easily send them to others, or download them to any computer with Internet access! Works for me!! (you'll need 3 accounts if this is what you want to do, too!!)

If you are using Utorrent as your file share, highlight each file, double click then paste the above trackers.

The video course torrent files were created more than a year ago. It only has one tracker for pirate bay and is no longer recommended. Add all of the above trackers will make a big difference for connected peers and download speed.

,daveshelper,2008-01-06T03:36Z,"Thank you:

All who  seed this series of 25 disk. It's a long list and large files.

I'm asking your help. 

Please... After you complete a download Leave it to seed until a couple more people can take your place.

I've tried off and on for more than a year to make this teaching course available.

This is my last run. 

I'll be off the net in a couple of weeks. 

It's up to you whether these torrents live or die."
