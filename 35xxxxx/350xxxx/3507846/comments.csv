,Harvesterz,2007-06-30T21:57Z,"Could someone do me a favor and PLEASE upload the Gowenna repack here?  

It would be much appreciated on this end!

Thanks"
,Harvesterz,2007-07-19T06:02Z,"Thanks for the response mistal.

Yea I did see it listed on there.  Thanks for the heads up about how the site is run.

BTW, I am trying to download it on eMule but as u may know rare files are brutally slow.  The que system it uses is the pits.  After over 2 weeks of nonstop running I have less than half of the game!!! :-( lol

I'm hoping it'll someday show up somewhere where I can easily download it."
,Harvesterz,2007-08-16T05:06Z,"I've registered on blackcats and you were right.  I haven't even dl anything cause there isn't anything there that can't be found else where.  I made an effort one night to find parkan and I did....so absent that there isn't anything I want on there.

Thanks again for the response mistal.  Much Appreciated on this end!"
,crusader11,2009-06-14T08:30Z,hey i downloaded this game but how do install it???
,zetapulse,2009-08-13T14:44Z,"I've downloaded but:
1) There is no cue/bin file
2) Whenever extracting I get a WinRAR Diagnostic Message saying ""Parkan Iron Strategy Deviance Final part0#.rar: Invalid or corrupt authenticity information"", for every rar part.

Solution? Alternative downloads?"
,FreeKill38,2011-05-19T10:14Z,I hope this one works well.
