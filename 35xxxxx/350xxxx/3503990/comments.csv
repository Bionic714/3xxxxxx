can someone please seed the dvd torrent."
,Yadott,2006-07-26T15:20Z,"Yeah, some explanation would be welcome !!
Where it dissapered??"
,Dracura,2006-07-26T23:44Z,"Oh, Sorry, we forgot to make the announcement.

We couldn't upload the DVD version past 25%. We left it up for about 2 days and no one downloaded more than 25%, plus it ate most of our bandwidth.

So, we regretfully must announce that we will not release DVD versions unless we find someone with a very high upload rate. Sorry folks. :("
