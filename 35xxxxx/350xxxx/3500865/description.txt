The story of this much acclaimed film concerns a young English girl on a train going home from vacation in the Balkans. The girl, Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood), meets a kindly old lad named Miss Froy (Dame May Whitty) who befriends her when Iris is hit on the head by a falling flowerpot which, we later learn, was meant for Miss Froy. Iris naps on the train and upon awakening from her doze finds that Miss Froy has mysteriously vanished from the train and has been replaced an impostor in Miss Froy's clothing. Almost all of the passengers deny ever having seen the old lad and contend that she was an illusion brought on by Iris's accident with the falling flowerpot, a sincere young musician, Gilbert (Michael Redgrave) comes to her assistance. Our young couple meet up with a parade of sinister and bizarre characters as they search the train for a clue to Miss Froy's whereabouts. There is a circus magician and his family, an "eastern European" baroness, an over-friendly brain surgeon (Paul Lukas) and his nurse dressed as a nun. Slowly, Iris and her musical cohort discover that most of the people on the train are in the employ of or have a decided interest in the success of the apparently evil brain surgeon. But there is a handful of passengers who are on the couple's side and finally their interactions come into play.
