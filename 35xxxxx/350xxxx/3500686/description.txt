Synopsis: Joel Goodson is the type of teenager who makes his parents proud: he's nice, handsome, intelligent, and even principled. But when Joel's parents leave town for a few days, a series of events occur that will change Joel's sheltered life. For starters, he meets Lana, a hooker who proceeds to deflower our young hero, and then suggests he turn his home into a house of prostitution for one evening. Joel agrees, and just as sexy hookers and randy guys turn Joel's house upside down, a representative from Princeton University arrives, to interview Joel! How Joel handles this and other crises (losing his dad's Porsche, the loss of all his furniture, falling in love with a prostitute) will alter Joel's life forever. 
"One of the best American comedies of recent years" (Roger Ebert), Risky Business slyly explores the teen dilemma of growing up good-hearted but guilt-ridden. In his starmaking role as Joel, Tom Cruise is a charmer-with-conscience that foreshadows Jerry Maguire. Rebecca de Mornay makes a dynamic movie debut as liberated call girl Lana. They and writer/director Paul Brickman make Risky Business "a first-class affair" (People).
