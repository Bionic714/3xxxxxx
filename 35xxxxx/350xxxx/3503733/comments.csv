,condor81,2006-07-28T04:12Z,"after these comments you should take a look at the speeds (and prices) of the DSL connections in Greece. Then you would be probably more ""aggresive"" towards me...

But i think the game deserves the patience that you  showed. Let me know your opinion.

Also, I have a very large collection of                                                                       adventure games (I also play TBS) so if you want                     something just let me know
