,Breadfan866,2007-05-01T19:12Z,Did you seed volume 3?
,beckfan21,2007-05-09T04:42Z,"I'm sorry to everyone, but I have abandoned The Pirate Bay as of last August. I'm sorry I have not been seeding here. I moved my operations over to Demonoid. I actually have 4 volumes in this series, tohugh I am yet to upload any to Demonoid yet. I actually have a 5th volume on the way. I'm thinking about seeding here too, i'm still not sure yet. I'll keep everyone posted."
,dickalan,2009-12-18T23:26Z,beckfan21 - I have an established website called www.andrewwkmusic.com. I'm also a member of demonoid. I was wondering if you could upload this there!! I would love to see all what is on it. AND I would make sure it got distributed well. You're a huge asset to the AWK community for providing this!!! Thanks!
