,prometheusg,2008-09-22T04:49Z,"A little info some might not know. If you install this on a phone with Garmin XT AND you already have a map file installed, like say my Nokia N78 with North America 2009, it'll OVERWRITE the first map file on the device.

To prevent this, rename the map file you already have (like gmapsupp1.img => gmapsupp2.img). When mapinstall installs a new map, it'll create a new file called gmapsupp1.img.

So, you'll need to manually rename each map file after every phone upload."
,ghugg,2009-08-31T07:28Z,"Works for me.
Anybody know where to download the US topo 24k DVDs

Not the National Parks version."
,glenjamindle,2009-10-04T00:02Z,"After mounting to desktop I get 3 ISO files...east, west, and central. I run the setup.exe and get an error...Please insert disk ""US TOPO 24K National Parks East"".....


wtf?"
,glenjamindle,2009-10-04T00:23Z,"Pfffft.....extracted ISO to a disk and ran the setup from the disk
