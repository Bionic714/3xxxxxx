[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-02-13T05:31Z,"Heh, some friend!  Well now you can have this game again, and let's see your ""friend"" try to mess this one up!  hehehehe"
,Skogsmullen_89,2007-06-03T20:51Z,"OMG WinstonSmith
Please learn how to speak/write english!!!

I can hardly understand what you are talking about.
Fucking retard!!"
,bruno_83,2007-06-06T14:03Z,"heheh; great comment, skogsmullen.. ;)"
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-06-12T05:38Z,"Skogsmullen_89: I'm the retard that's submitted this heavily-seeded game and many other great torrents.  What have you done besides type idiotic comments?

I would beat the living dog shit right outta you if I met you in person, savvy you fuckin' n00b!?"
,NadaRama,2007-06-14T21:08Z,"Can't get it to work...missing ""data3.cab"" when I try to do a full install, and  a ""wrong signature for 'local file header'"" error when I try to play after a minimal install...grrr"
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-07-21T15:48Z,"NadaRama & ssnaress: Sorry about that, but OTOH it's a good thing that the (currently) other 10,093 users have gotten it to work.

BTW, I just d/led this myself and I got it to work just fine.  :)  Why don't you try doing a hash check when done d/ling."
,A-ske,2007-09-24T18:48Z,"What do i do when i have dl'ed it? i dont know what to do with these files that my pc dont seem to recognized.
Sorry about my n00bishness, but i'm new here.. hehe"
,masterfnogg,2007-09-26T11:16Z,Thx WinstonSmith6079 for this great game. Both this and the second encounter.
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-09-27T08:38Z,"masterfnogg: You're welcome.  It's good when people appreciate free stuff, instead of being a whiney, spoiled n00by little bitch, like Skogsmullen_89.  Keep checking my torrent pages as I like to share.

A-ske: No need to apologize as you seem more like a newb than a n00b.  Nothing wrong with being a newb--you gotta start somewhere, eh?

These two files compose a CD-ROM image.  Therefore you want a prg that handles CD images.  There are quite a few, but the most popular and well known are Daemon Tools, Nero, and Alcohol 120%.  I use Alcohol 120%, so I can help you with that one.

Using Alcohol 120%, you can drag & drop the .CUE file onto Alcohol's window. Then select Image Burning Wizard to burn the game to a CD. Then install from that CD, patch from the URL given in the description above, then play.

If you don't want to use an actual physical CD (or don't have a blank CD or don't have a CD burner), Alcohol 120% will create a virtual CD (& DVD) drive on your computer. Right-click on that virtual drive (it's in My Computer), select Mount Image > Open... and then browse for the .CUE file you want, in this case 'SeriousSam First.cue'. By doing that, you've inserted the CD image (which is a virtual CD) into the vitrual CD drive. Install the game, patch from the URL given in the description above, then play.

At least several copies of Alcohol 120% can be found on this site, and I'm going to guess that Daemon Tools and Nero would work similarly to Alcohol 120%."
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-09-29T11:32Z,This is the US version of the game.
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-10-02T10:50Z,No prob.  Glad that you like it.

,FinnishGuy,2008-07-10T16:22Z,"To Warec89:

Turn off second cpu, if you have DualCore processor. I had same problem with AMD DualCore.

This will help you:

You can do it manually also, but then you have to turn other processor off everytime you start a game. ->Go to task manager, select serious sam.exe, right click Set Affinity, disable CPU0 or CPU1 and click ok."
,Overkill360,2008-09-21T12:58Z,"Works perfectly, no problems"
