,NoCode0680,2010-11-30T22:58Z,"Yeah, this is garbage.  I wonder what causes people to put stuff like this up.  Don't get me wrong, I appreciate people putting together torrents for the rest of us, and I'm well aware that I didn't pay for this, but why even waste time seeding something like this?  Why patch together a bunch of low quality recordings from various sources and call it ""Love You Live""?"
