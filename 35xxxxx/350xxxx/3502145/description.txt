:HIGHLIGHTS:

* Kure Kure is disgraced and is forced to commit harakari with Debora as his "backup".
* Kure Kure and Chonbo work out a scam where they beat the shit out of the other
characters and then charge them exorbitant doctor's fees.
* Kure Kure uses his Ninjitsu to impersonate other characters in a bid to spring
Chonbo out of jail.
* Kure Kure and Chonbo take over To Ro Ro's spiritual medium/fortune teller business
(ie. they beat the shit out of him and take his business) with disastrous results.
* Biragon snaps! After Kure Kure and Chonbo attempt to steal his marbles, he captures
Chonbo and threatens to dice him up with his katana.
* Kure Kure and Chonbo spy on one of the Sea Cucumber Gang dancing around in a grass
skirt. What next transpires is one of the greatest battle royales in the show's
history where nearly every character wants in on the grass skirt!
* Kure Kure and Chonbo find a fire extinguisher and go around spraying everyone's
food with it causing some of the villagers to get upset with them.
* Debora decides to run a remedial math class for the village but he finds keeping
discipline in the classroom to be a problem.
* Kure Kure sniffs too much incense at Debora's church and he begins to hallucinate
about what married life with Monro might be like.
* Kure Kure proves once and for all that cowboys are tougher than samurais.
* Kure Kure begins cross-dressing in an attempt to impress the other villagers, but
he's punished for gender transgression.
* To Ro Ro uses a magic lantern to produce a robot servant. Behind Kure Kure's back,
Chonbo steals the lantern and gets the robot to do his laundry for him.




Getting to know the gang from Kure Kure Takora :




Kure Kure Takora.

Fact: His best-friend is a weak-willed squash* although he has no problems about
leaving him for dead if he has to make a fast getaway.
Fact: Like everyone else in the world, he's in love with a fickle pink walrus.
Fact: Kure Kure Takora employs a type of Ninjitsu where he can turn into anything
from a dopey iguana to a vacuum cleaner to a guitar.
Fact: Kure Kure Takora's greatest fear is being doused with vinegar and being
served as Sudako (pickled octopus).





Chonbo.

Fact: Kure Kure Takora's best friend and toadie.
Fact: Is a squash-humanoid of the genus cucurbita, who is able to cough up coins for
vending machines at will.
Fact: Although he is complicit in many of Kure Kure's schemes, he's just as often on
the receiving end of Kure Kure's abuse.
Fact: Very mobile for a squash, Chonbo is often seen somersaulting and tumbling.





To Ro Ro.

Fact: Is a short jellyfish who squawks like Flipper.
Fact: Is able to spray vinegar out of the top of his head via a sprinkler (?!).
Kure Kure often attempts to neutralize this super power (Kure Kure is deadly
afraid of vinegar) by throwing hats on his head.
Fact: Can turn invisible and teleport at will.
Fact: Is even a bigger trouble-maker than Kure Kure Takora, and most of the other
characters are frightened of him.





Monro.

Fact: Is pink walrus with a breathy voice and sexy theme music.
Fact: Acts as the female McGuffin, or little object a, that all the other male
characters pursue.
Fact: Often demands unreasonable things from her suitors before she loses interest
in them.
Fact: Has been romantically involved with every creature (even the repellent sea
cucumber gang) on the show.





Debura.

Fact: A rotund badger who is often seen chewing on the stub of a cigar.
Fact: This tough cop runs the local jail.
Fact: He's the only character who wears clothes* gun belt, holster, truncheon, and
sometimes a helmet.





Biragon.

Fact: A dumb, slow-witted iguana.
Fact: He is extremely lazy and spends most of his time sleeping.
Fact: Maybe the richest character on the show, he often has a new gadget or toy that
is covetted by Kure Kure.





The Sea Cucumber Gang

Fact: Last, and certainly least, is the repellant Sea Cucumber Gang.
Fact: These dummies have their own theme song which they occasionally break in to.
Fact: I believe each of them refer to anger (Ikari), happiness (Hera Hera) and
sadness (Shiku Shiku).
Fact: The Sea Cucumber Gang are on the very bottom of the hierarchy of the characters,
and poor Shiku Shiku gets picked on the most!





Here's the lyrics to the theme song (and a translation):

KURE KURE KURE
KUREPPE
KURYARUKA
KURYARINKO
Nandemo hoshigaru KUREKURE TAKORA

Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie
Scheming win or lose
Scheming little thief (child pickpocket)
You?ll do anything to get what you want, Gimmie Gimmie Octopus
