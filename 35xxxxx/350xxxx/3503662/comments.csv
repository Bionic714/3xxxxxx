,peteralf,2006-07-15T23:09Z,"I am currently seeding S4D6. This would be a good time for newcomers to jump on that one. If anyone has the .torrent files for the disappeared DS9 torrents, PM me here."

,robbor,2006-07-16T10:05Z,"Great, your the best !"
,knutte68,2006-07-16T11:29Z,miljoner tack!!!!
,bender-c,2006-07-16T13:40Z,"Hmm, i was looking through the dvd's here, and i seems to miss s2d6 and s2d7, where they never out?"
,peteralf,2006-07-16T14:01Z,"I just finished seeding S4D6 and S4D7. Starting S5D1. I just received the .torrent files for these dvds (thank you):
DS9_S2D2
DS9_S2D5
DS9_S2D6
DS9_S2D7
DS9_S3D1
DS9_S4D4
DS9_S5D2
DS9_S5D3

I am currently seeding S5D1 till there is a few seeds. I will then put up S5D2 and S5D3 which were lost when the server was seized. If there is anyone interested in seeding any of these ""lost"" torrents (that means uploading them and then seeding them) send me a PM with an email and I will send them to you. There's a lot of people stuck in these ""ghost torrents"" who already have partial copies of them, so seeding them shouldn't be too onerous.

This is the full list of .torrents I have gathered so far:
DS9_S1D1
DS9_S1D2
DS9_S1D3
DS9_S1D4
DS9_S1D5
DS9_S1D6
DS9_S2D2
DS9_S2D4
DS9_S2D5
DS9_S2D6
DS9_S2D7
DS9_S3D1
DS9_S3D2
DS9_S3D3
DS9_S3D4
DS9_S3D5
DS9_S3D6
DS9_S3D7
DS9_S4D1
DS9_S4D2
DS9_S4D3
DS9_S4D4
DS9_S4D6
DS9_S4D7
DS9_S5D1
DS9_S5D2
DS9_S5D3

Again, if you have one that's not on that list, please PM me to get an email to send them to.

In re bender-c: I have the .torrents for those DVDs and will eventually get around to them, but if anyone would like to help bender-c who has so generously seeded these last few DVDs, see above.

BTW, there was one of the DVDs that was originally put up by petsel in DVD9 format. I recoded it with CCE, but I don't remember which DVD it was. Anybody remember?"
,bender-c,2006-07-16T14:14Z,the dvd9 was s2d5
,peteralf,2006-07-16T14:29Z,"Thanks, bender. I'll have to seed that one from scratch, then."
,Pissant,2006-10-01T16:05Z,"Peteralf are you getting around to seede S5D4? I really hope so, because we are  about 42 people there with 96.3% and have been there for almost 2 weeks now. Anyone else are welcome to seed also. :) Hope there is a friendly soul somewhere."
,metaphant,2008-03-05T17:25Z,We are many that are stuck on 95-99%. Can someone help out? Please!
