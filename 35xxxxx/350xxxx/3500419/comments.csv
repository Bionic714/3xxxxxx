Downloaders note:  Safenet inc : 38.100.15.0 - 38.100.15.255 are running Azureus peers on this swarm, please make sure you block this range.  They were also on a Johny Cash torrent here recently but don't seem to be poisoning the data - the torrent was fine."

It's new to me, and I suspect new to lots of others too."
