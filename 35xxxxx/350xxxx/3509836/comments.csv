,meskalamdug,2006-08-10T23:38Z,I'm wondering ! some of you guys are worry about a VIRUS of SPYWARE or bla bla bla...  Why you don't download a nice Internet security software like ZoneAlarm or Bitdefender or ... that are all available in many websites like www.9down.com  or here in torrent world ? I know that there is no 100% guaranty but it helps alot .
