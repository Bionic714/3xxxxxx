,dalpha,2006-07-13T14:39Z,one of the best films ever
,SolSlyng,2006-07-13T14:49Z,"This Film is extraordinarily well photographed , with many scenes shot in veery low (candle)light without artificial lighting with a super hightech lens (a 50 mm with incredible low aperture=light loss of F/0,7) built by the Carl Zeiss company for NASA , who let Kubrick use it exclusively because they were impressed by the Sci-Fi scenes in ""2001 - a Space Odyssey"""
,NachOnmi,2006-07-14T12:24Z,And.. it would be even better if people didnt erase it as soon as they have it
,kovesp,2006-07-15T23:45Z,This movie has always been in my top 10. I have a different version (different set of subtitles) so I'll just upload a new torrent and seed it.
,martinuz,2006-11-08T07:23Z,Great!
,T.Abu,2006-11-14T20:15Z,"Unfortunately, this torrent is not in full resolution, and this movie suffers more badly then most films, because of it´s dark scenes. Too bad! Why bother seeding an almost full resolution dual DVD when it still won´t fit into a single DVD? 

Thanks anyway, but it´s annoying..."
