[V],sia,2006-07-16T14:23Z,Tack för en utförlig och lättläst info!
,MrEarp,2006-07-16T15:07Z,THX for a really readable information about this movie.
,FourthTry,2006-07-16T16:41Z,"Is there some kind of Spanish invasion going on around here? Most of the movies seem to be with Spanish 'subtitulos' and description. Where are the good old Nordic versions? I don't mind those Señors uploading stuff here, but I'd like to see some readable text for a while."
,vinylking,2006-07-16T16:48Z,Men det finns i alla falll röda och gröna färger...
,MrEarp,2006-07-16T19:18Z,ForthyTry I agree with you and this is a nordic based site not a spanish.
,superche2005,2006-07-18T21:19Z,"FourthTry and MrEarp
If there are no Nordic people uploading then you'll find no Nordic versions! So I guess you should look for the blame in your own pocket I think. Mind you I'm neither Latino nor Nordic or Scandinavian. 

Or do you perhaps mean that only Nordic can upload perhaps? That would be a bunch of B.S. "
