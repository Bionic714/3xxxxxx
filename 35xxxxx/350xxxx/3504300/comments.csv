,KoidRok,2011-03-18T03:57Z,@Belnik why you gotta be such a dick. THUNDER CATS isnt a good enough description. Wat a JERK...

,dogshark,2012-05-27T08:34Z,"6gb and poor quality and archived?

Is this for real?

It's the only Thundercats I can find. so if I don't want to be murdered by my 4 year old while I sleep it had better be legit and not viruses....

Ever heard of a sample?"
,dogshark,2012-06-29T02:11Z,"so after weeks of downloading. then getting a daa converter. the iso is broken. DVD shrink cant convert it to something watchable. Like we should have to convert something twice anyhow.

Unless you have a duel layer dvd burner this will not work. I have DL burner. but no DL disks...


Dont waste your time people. there are better torrents.

It also looks like this (if you can get it to work) is the new thundercats which is inferior according to my kid. If you want new thundercats there are better and faster torrents all over the place.

If you want the original thundercats. try this torrent. It's running a reasonable speed for the few seeders there are. http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6591077/Thundercats_Complete_Collection_1985-1987"
