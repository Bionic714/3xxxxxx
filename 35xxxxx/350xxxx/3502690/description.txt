This album derives its inspiration from the artists 1991 journey through the Australian continent. It is a grandiose, symphonic work, full of rich sonic texture and Aboriginal rhythms. However, it never attempts to emulate the native music or culture. This is a superb example of sonic imagery at its best and a seminal Robert Fox album.
