,vietnam999990,2007-06-21T15:05Z,"doesn't look like a typical axxo page - and is not listed on his, i'm guessing this is a fake axxo, mind you alot of downloads and no complaints... is this real?"
,Pyatin,2007-11-13T08:30Z,"Don't post movies with aXXo's name in the title if you're not aXXo.  If you're reposting an aXXo torrent, state it in the torrent info.  Show some respect for THE MAN."

,gas1can,2007-12-01T02:47Z,"I have never posted fake torrents, Axxo is my hero, and i will not put my name in the same category as his. I will re-seed one of his torrents but that is the end of it."
