Due to the lack of decent torrents of this great film, I thought I'd post my own rip. Here's some info:

*Ripped on the Mac with HandBrake 0.7.1*
English
Widescreen
Xvid encoding - 2 pass - approx 20fps
160 kbps audio (AC-3)

This rip looks and sounds great, will play with any player - though I always recommend VLC - and will fit on a single CDrom.

For anyone looking for a good "Spiderman 2" - there are a lot of crap, full screen, and foreign versions - I recommend:

Enjoy, and please seed!
