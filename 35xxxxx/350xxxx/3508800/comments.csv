,redmags22,2006-08-11T22:46Z,"The Practice season 4.
I realize you only have 1mb/s but seeing as how there's only 32 mb left for the majority to download  if you upped that last little bit I'm sure we'd all help  seed."
,malfourmed,2006-08-15T05:59Z,Add to the plea of those stuck at 99.4%
,jv389,2006-08-19T22:15Z,"What's this?  Someone with 100%?  I'll believe it when I see it......LOL  Seriously though, what's crazy is this torrent is that old,  i've been stuck at 99.3 for a week or two, and just got got up to 99.4 a few days ago.  If someone could seed it would be appreciated."

When I looked this morning (CET) there was someone online with 100%. This is good news because this means it is there. He just needs to stay online long enough that others can download and seed.""
Anyone here computer savvy enough to find out where fenixbrood lives? What is up with peeps who upload torrent of multiple gigs and then leave folks hanging?
At least some eps are watchable - but this is inexcusable - average download speed 3 KB/s within 99:99:99
18 days ago my client reported 34 mb remaining today it's at 28 mb - 18 days to dl 6 mb? 

this is the last torrent I dl from fenixbrood!

SEED OR DIE GODDAMNIT! "
,malfourmed,2006-09-29T17:45Z,This just finished downloading. After two months!! It's like a miracle!!
,k4u2000,2006-11-25T09:43Z,"I downloaded this torrent. But when I try to put the episodes on DVD , it transcodes each episodes and each DVD with 3 episodes takes 4 hours to write... Am i doing something wrong? Im using Nero Suite."
,sebbe_1840,2008-05-26T01:02Z,I cant seed all the time so just write when you need someone to seed!
,nonickname,2008-08-31T11:18Z,"Anybody knows where to find subtitles for this??

Thanks for UL!!"
,kenzo69,2008-10-29T01:18Z,"Where is season 5???

It's the only season not on the tracker..."
,Smokeypaulie,2009-03-11T00:33Z,"U sir, the original uploader, are a king among men.

The Practice, is 1 of the greatest shows on tv, it's most impressive feat, is that it was in the 90's, when most tv was pretty light and silly. Much less gritty and edgy.

It's a real shame this hasn't gotten a full proper release on dvd, they just teased us with the beginning."
,yooden,2010-06-07T23:09Z,"4x20, 10:50, subliminal for ""Hot Pockets"". There are more."
,Aeronomer,2010-08-10T16:10Z,It's not really subliminal if you can see it. Duh. 
,eltigre0963,2010-11-07T14:01Z,Grateful if someone could please Seed this Torrent for me - Thank You
