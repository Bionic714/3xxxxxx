,TheSpenner,2006-07-29T16:15Z,"To burn the DVD with Nero, choose ""DVD-Video"" as the Compilation Type, select all of the files from this Torrent, and burn the DVD."

Thanks for the download, great quality.

quick qst: when i want to make a DVD out of this - to play on DVD player connected to TV, do can i jus copy these files onto a DVD player, as in are they already encoded onto a dvd format. 

do i have to do ith with Nero using DVD-compilation, and what is the effect of doing it this way.

Also, in future if i want to download DVD movies what particualr file formats do i require if i want them to be burnt onto DVDs - here are so may movies out there - are ISO DVD suitable?

Hope someone can help"

,levdr,2008-03-03T03:12Z,Apart from the selectable subtitles there are English subs that cannot be turned off!!! Thanks for wasting my time. 
,TheSpenner,2008-07-23T00:31Z,"*levdr* - umm, no, there are not hardcoded subtitles. Dunno how you burned it, but my burn has no subs unless you choose to turn them on."
