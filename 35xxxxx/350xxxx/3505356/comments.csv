,traveler78,2006-07-21T23:51Z,"Sorry, I'm quite new to the bitTorrent thing (downloaded Azureus 2 days ago). I chose to ""open the torrent for seeding""  when I created it in Azureus. If I choose to open the torrent in Azureus is says that it has already been added. Is there anything else I need to do?

However, I also have great difficulty with NAT problems even after following the advice on ""NAT problem"" on AzureusWiki. Do you have any suggestions where to get good advice, or maybe I should use another client? Thankful for advice."
