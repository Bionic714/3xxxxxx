...2A.mp3 - 436 errors
...3A.mp3 - 212 errors
...3B.mp3 -   1 error
...4B.mp3 - 226 errors

The other files are ok.

Tested with mp3val, from http://mp3val.sourceforge.net/ - MP3val is a small, high-speed, free software tool for checking MPEG audio files' integrity. It can be useful for finding corrupted files (e.g. incompletely downloaded, truncated, containing garbage)."

,ePants,2008-10-29T19:42Z,"Warning about the .pdf's in this torrent.

The file ""PHOTOREADING MANUAL PLC.pdf"" has several errors:

1) There should be a blank page after the title page (for printing purposes).

1) Page 51 is missing, and has a duplicate of page 57 in its place. (page 57 still appears in its proper location as well)

3) Page 54 is missing altogether.

4) Page 56 is missing altogether.

5) Page 63 appears twice, which throws off the odd-pages-on-right-and-even-pages-on-left pattern of page number for the last several pages when printing. 

The file ""Photoreading Whole Mind System.pdf"" has a splash graphic as the first page, and also should have a blank page after the title page.

There appear to be several blank pages missing from the file ""Seven Day Speed Reading And Learning Program-Photoreading.pdf"" as well.  It also would be nice if the margins weren't so incredibly huge.  

All this should, of course, be considered while remembering that the material is presented as free.  The fact that it's free is the only reason that I'll not vote this down for all the errors.  

If anyone happens to correct copies of these files, I'd be particularly interested in getting the missing pages."

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4464916/Paul_Scheele_-_Audiobooks

That torrent is missing 6A and 6B, but its 2A, 3A, 3B and 4B don't have any errors and can be used to replace the ones in this one."
