,friendly,2006-07-23T12:29Z,There is no crack dir on the dvd..
[T],sotis,2006-07-23T13:43Z,"@ friendly: Look again, it´s there! Maybe you are looking in the dwonloaded folder instead of the inserted (or mounted) DVD?"
,Derc,2006-07-23T15:55Z,Thanks again for another GREAT upload Sotis! How have you been lately? I was hoping I could talk you into uploading the crack only as I have the Image file but I need the Crack. Or do you know where else it is? I have been using cureROM with some success. Sometimes it doesn't want to load though. Thanks in advance!! :)
[T],sotis,2006-07-23T17:13Z,"@ Derc: Hi! I uploaded the crack here: http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3506423
Have a nice day!"
,Kvante,2006-07-24T09:07Z,THANKS SOTIS!!! I love Ferrari!!!! This game reminds me of the old arcades.....
,Sweden(We Try Harder),2006-07-24T09:59Z,"Spelet funkar men bilden blir konstig när spelet börjar, nån som har nått tips, grafikkortet eller nån inställning kanske? TACK! "
,brosee13,2006-07-24T13:47Z,"Hey sotis.

A quick question....or 2.

Is the crack included or should I dl the link above to crack? 
And.... Is the online play feature possible with this dl?

Thanks for any response and the upload.

,Str8_Burner,2006-07-24T17:29Z,i have 1 question(for those who have dw it already)...How is the steering at this game?thanks in advance for any responce.
[T],sotis,2006-07-24T20:32Z,The crack is included on the DVD.
[T],sotis,2006-07-24T20:34Z,"Well, it´s defintely no car simulator. It runs like the old Outrun you found in the arcades for 20 years ago... "
[T],sotis,2006-07-24T20:36Z,I haven´t tried the online multiplayer yet. But in combination with Hamachi (simple VPN) it worked fin to make a LAN multiplayer with a friend.
,brosee13,2006-07-24T20:39Z,Wow. Quick response. Thanks again sotis.

,stigers,2006-08-23T10:37Z,The game ONLY works if monitor ie set to 60 Hz!!!
,ironbloodus2k6,2006-09-06T10:13Z,"Ok, the game works fine except for one thing.

The graphics are hyperactive. The borders around selections blink ultra fast. When i'm trying to play the actual game..it's runs mega fast. I mean like if you were to play an old-ass PC game in a new highend machine with nothing to slow the CPU down.

Anyone have ideas?

AMD 3200+ 64bit

,81Ramirez,2007-09-03T20:35Z,"I´m having the same problem as ironbloodus2k6.

The graphics are hyperactive. The borders around selections blink ultra fast. When i'm trying to play the actual game..it's runs mega fast. I mean like if you were to play an old-ass PC game in a new highend machine with nothing to slow the CPU down.

In the manual...
DUAL CORES
OutRun2006: Coast 2 Coast is compatible with dual core PC's. However, should the game experience problems with your dual core PC, please set the affinity of the program to one of the CPU's.

1) Run OutRun2006: Coast 2 Coast
2) Press CTRL-ALT-DEL
3) On the task manager select process
4) Find the OutRun2006 process
5) Right click on the process and set affinity to just one checkbox

But it didn´t help.
Anyone have any ideas?
