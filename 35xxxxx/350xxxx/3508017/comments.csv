At the moment I have problems connecting to the prq announce tracker, but there are alternate trackers in the torrent which I am seeding on, and as soon as I can connect to the pirate bay tracker I'll be seeding there too."
,kukenIstyret,2006-08-06T01:11Z,"This is beautiful. For me this is exactly what TPB is all about, finding these old treasures in digital form.
That Compusion 12"" is up on my turntable every now and then.
Thanx fisk0!"
,kukenIstyret,2006-08-06T01:14Z,"Jag får det här meddelandet: [""Test Dept"" : dålig data från trackern -ogiltigt meddelandeintervall], men kan lada ner ändå.
Vet någon vad det innebär? Jag använde BitTorrent."
,fisk0,2006-08-13T13:08Z,"kukenIstyret: En av de trackers som står i filen körs från min hemdator, samma som låtarna ligger på. Antar att det kan bli lite för mycket belastning för datorn ibland så att något hamnar ur synk."

,CelticL0,2007-02-22T02:51Z,"annoying. 
I'm not connecting to the single seed. Which is fair enough, that's the net for you. BUT 59 people downloaded this and only one seed exists on such a unique torrent."
,fisk0,2007-02-26T23:30Z,"Sorry, I can't seed it anymore as I have updated and changed some of the files on my hard drive. I might upload an updated torrent soon though, just have to move everything to my new computer and possibly buy a few more of their albums to share."
