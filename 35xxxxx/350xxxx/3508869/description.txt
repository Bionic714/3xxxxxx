With the release of "A Night at the Opera" in 1975, Queen catapulted into the rock 'n' roll mainstream and broke new ground with the wildly inventive single "Bohemian Rhapsody." This installment of the Classic Albums series examines the creative process behind the landmark recording, featuring interviews with late singer Freddie Mercury, guitarist Brian May, drummer Roger Taylor and the album's original producer, Roy Thomas Baker.
