,belga1,2006-07-17T22:03Z,"Seeding with BITCOMET (must be same for others..)
Hit 'Maker'. This brings up the make torrent gui. 
Fill in the fields. 
If it's just one file, point to that file. 
If more than one file, click 'Directory (Multi-files)' and point to that 
directory. 
Fill in the tracker address (you need a tracker which you can get 
from the web site that's hosting the torrent). 
Select an output directory and give a name for the .torrent file. 
Hit O.K. 
(you may also drap directory/file into bitcomet. That dialog above will show up.) 
Upload your .torrent file to the website. 
Start the seeding task."
,tugunska,2006-07-17T22:41Z,"ok I've started using utorrent the option ""start seeding"" for the B-1B and Captainsim on floats ok??"
,belga1,2006-07-18T01:37Z,"Geez..I see a lot of ppls waiting on the door...lol...but no seed at all... :)  :)
Hehe seem's tugunska must go at a ""seed perfectionement school""..ROFL."
,tugunska,2006-07-18T04:03Z,"I've decided to use bittorrent cos utorrent is a lil had (at least for me) as far as I can see some files are being seeded by now, but I had learn almost alone...errors always happen this way, but now thinks are goingo to be better.
bekga thanks for the tips"
