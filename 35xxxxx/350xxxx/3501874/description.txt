Lexie suggests Brandon quit the hospital and work with her at the free clinic. When Brady hears Belle and Shawn arguing, he suggests that maybe they just aren't meant to be. Philip hears Belle retort that Brady shouldn't offer advice since he's been denying that he loves Chloe. Brady goes home, hears someone call his name, and turns to see Isabella. The aliens sneak into the Wesley House and steal Nancy's robe and Craig's shirt. They take out the photo of Belle and Shawn and the boy rips it in half, keeping the "Belle" side and giving the "Shawn" half to the girl. Craig informs Bo that the surveillance tapes corroborate the nurses' story that the babies were in the wrong bassinet, but had the correct ID bracelets on. Abe tells Bo and Roman that the top rookie from the police academy has decided he wants to work with Roman. Bo and Roman are shocked when the new rookie enters and is none other than Billie Reed.
