This is a reupload, the previous torrent was uploaded like 2 years ago and
had like 7000 downloads!... The torrent got lost in the TPB raid a month ago.
The backup was never complete before the police shut down the servers and this
was one torrent that was missed.

All euromach albums:

Euromach 01  Euromach 05  Euromach 09  Euromach 13
Euromach 02  Euromach 06  Euromach 10  Euromach 14
Euromach 03  Euromach 07  Euromach 11  Euromach 15
Euromach 04  Euromach 08  Euromach 12  Euromach 16 - FINAL

Eurobeat has evolved from Italo Disco and it sounds similar to Eurodance,
but faster and if possible happier with really crazy songtexts. In short.
For a good eurobeat history page see: http://www.eurobeat-prime.com/history.php

Avex Trax that owns the copyright for these albums are NOT interested to
market eurobeat outside japan. Like most record companys they dont get that
people will be able to buy mp3s online (not DRM wma!). Eurobeat is mostly
unheard of outside japan. You can only buy eurobeat inside japan (however
some online shops ships to the whole world, but its VERY expensive). It
probably wouldnt work to market eurobeat in USA aka Rap/Hiphop land but I
belive it would work in Europe.
