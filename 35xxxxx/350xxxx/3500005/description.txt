A few words about this MIXAMIX_20050120:
Another Driving mix. Although it has started in January it is meanted for Hot nights.
It was created while having in my mind a special route by the sea with dith difficult turns.
With only just a softer stop at track14 all other tracks are there for power and  more power.
Again my favorite music style. Techno,Trance, House,Breaks, Rock and Ambient are all here at their best!
Wondering how is this possible just hear this, and then you will understand why some call me the crazy DJ.
Eye of the Tiger is enchanged in a more ambient version by me by adding more synths in back from
Anne Clark's Haunted Road which connects as to the next favourite from Depech Mode. Enjoy the Silence.
Also here New intro for Furius Angels!
And finally watch what happens when you mix Cobalt with Duran Duran - Whitelines(remixed by Dj Mentzik)
and how Enya can close such a cd and still dont break the spirit (in fact will leave u wanting more :))!
This cds really represents what music I would like to hear!
