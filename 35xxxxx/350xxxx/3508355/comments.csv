,Wybe,2006-08-28T15:05Z,"zeus, in the extended version there are shots and some dialogues that aren't shown in the cinema version (like now you see that the soldiers who knew maximus's execution failed are actually executed). Small scenes but definately cool.

Excellent rip, bytheway"

,canis_lupus_paternus,2006-12-27T17:38Z,"han_andre, WTF are you talking about???  I hate to burst your bubble, but Jesus of Nazareth was put to death about 150 years before the time period this film purports to depict.  If you're gonna drag Our Lord into the conversation, at least have a clue as to what you're saying.

BTW, thanks, axxo, for the release.  Kick ASS!"

,unicorndog,2007-04-08T09:16Z,Anyone know where to find English subtitles for this extended version?  I've only found English subs for a version that is 2 hours 21 minutes.  This one seems to clock in at 2:37 (not counting ending credits)
,o_motors,2007-05-02T07:31Z,"I also have that high pitch, loud crackling noise instead of audio from the first to the last second of the movie. I thought the download might be corrupted so I downloaded apparently the same form another source with same result. Does anyone know why is this problem occurring in this and some other movies? "
,olav93,2007-05-09T20:18Z,"people who wants seeds, seed self."
,EvanStz,2007-06-23T02:26Z,"English subtitles for the extended edition on this page:

,porkypig1990,2007-11-11T01:38Z,What happened to aXXo's thousands of seeds?! And the rest of his movies?
,aznk1d74,2008-02-23T02:42Z,wut do i do if there is no sound??? please help me!!!
,805566,2008-03-17T09:54Z,"People...

First off who cares about a 2CD file size--with most movies of this length it is normal (looks shitty when compressed to one disc). Who cares that there aren't thousands of seeders--some people get tired of having the same files around all the time. And many simply leech.

This is a great movie, an awesome rip (though outside of torrents you have to watch those aXXo filenames--most are fake) and it works fine on this end. If it didn't, there would be very few seeds. Audio problems? Switch out your codecs and for F's sake put VLC to rest. K-Lite Codec Pack and Media Player Classic is the winning combo for any kind of rip. ANY.

Kudos to aXXo."
,armakos,2008-03-19T10:52Z,Guys i cant hear nothing in the movie!
