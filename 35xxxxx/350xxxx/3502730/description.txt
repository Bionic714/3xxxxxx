'Counterfeit' Catholicism
Traditional Benedictine Monk, Brother Michael Dimond said that the current Vatican represents a "counterfeit" Catholic church and contradicts Catholic doctrine. For instance, he noted that the wording of some masses were changed to the point where they became invalid. He also argued that followers of other religions besides Catholicism will not be entitled to salvation when they die.

One of the signs of "End Times" is the "Whore of Babylon," predicted in the Apocalypse and Dimond suggested that this term actually refers to the counterfeit Catholic church. He also declared that Sister Lucia, who received the prophecies at Fatima, was actually an imposter after 1960, when the real Lucia either died or was killed. That is why the third secret of Fatima wasn't revealed at the time, he said.

In the last hour, the notorious phone caller J.C. got through to the program to challenge Brother Dimond's views, with his trademark harangue.
