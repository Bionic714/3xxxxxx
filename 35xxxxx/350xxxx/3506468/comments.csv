,manndrine,2006-07-23T22:27Z,"Sorry, I'll host the pics through a diff. site"
,manndrine,2006-07-24T01:28Z,"N/M - just use the ""Screenshots"" link in the info section"
[T],clownmonkey,2006-07-25T10:53Z,"No seeds, 202 leechers, no comments as to quality and whatnot?  Curiouser and curiouser...."
,manndrine,2006-07-25T12:20Z,"there is 1 seed, tpb tracker is finicky about weither or not it likes to display correct torrent info (by this afternoon there will be more seeders...).as far as quailty you can always check the ""screenshots"" flink located in the torrent info: http://www.esnips.com/web/manndrine-cars"
,Tremulous,2006-07-27T01:32Z,"The screens look ace. Thanks for upping this but everyone seems stuck on 62.8/62.9% at the mo :S

Is your upload speed really limited?"
,manndrine,2006-07-27T07:26Z,"I have my upload limited to 100kb... but am only maxing out at 50kb. I have share ratino of 2.4 for this torrent, so greedy bastards/bitches not seeding is playing a role.

I used Azureus to create the torrent, if there is a better app to use then let me know, as I have a dvd version of ""superman returns"" to release... both 1 disc and 2 disc collectors edition."
,Tremulous,2006-07-27T19:00Z,"I use an app called uTorrent. It does the same as Azureus but takes ALOT less resources.

http://www.utorrent.com/

Superman Returns eh? cool. Will keep my eyes open for that.

Looking at it there will be alot of people finishing around the same time so there should be a massive jump in the number of seeders then. "
,Tremulous,2006-07-29T01:37Z,"Getting some CRC errors while trying to unrar the files. Seems random though (first time was around 44, then 52 then on another test the early files :S) so trying a defrag at the mo to see if it helps before i carry on seeding.
Any1 else had any crc errors?"
,manndrine,2006-07-29T01:59Z,"I just doulbed checked my rar, all worked fine. 

You can now go to the screenshots site and get both the dvd lable and dvd case image for the movie (link below)

ps Scratch superman returns; i dont think it helps tpb to upload torrents of shitty movies... I'll have clerks up by the end of the weekend.

enjoy the movie, please remember to seed"
,nantyrm,2006-07-29T04:55Z,problem unraring here
,Backpacker216,2006-07-29T20:29Z,"Incredible job with this.  Great vidoe quality and sound, quick download. Thanks!"
,nantyrm,2006-07-30T15:31Z,"When I unrar there are no files in the audio folder. Is this normal?
 I usually have no problems with this but feel like I am missing a step - what do i do with the unrared files?
Many thanks"
,manndrine,2006-07-30T16:41Z,"There are hardly if ever files in the audio folder. Once you've unrar'd the files you need too use and application like nero; open nero and select ""DVD-Video"" (the compilation type); then simply drag the files from the ""video_ts"" (that you urared) into the the ""video_ts"" folder in nero; then all you have left to do is to click the burn button (remember this is the dvd-release. so you need to have a dvd burner and a blank dvd to burn it)"
,nantyrm,2006-07-30T18:21Z,Many thanks it worked great! Fantastic.
,muderan,2006-07-31T01:29Z,"Ive been having problems with torrents like this one with part files, I assumed that you just unzip the first one...then what? I am using an extraction program called Extract now, any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks."
,manndrine,2006-08-02T10:20Z,"you should give a program called ""winrar"" a try, its very pop and works great."
,paulbr,2006-08-02T22:17Z,"""Audio files"" are only present if the disc has DVD Audio content, this is a dvd movie so - only the Video folder should be used (but you need both folders on the disc)."
,Erunas,2006-08-05T10:38Z,Excellent torrent manndrine il keep seedin though i have not watched the movie yet ;)
,sunkan1983,2006-08-06T11:38Z,"How do I burn this movie on to a DVD?
I'm using nero vision 3 and I don't got a clue how to do? Is there a site on the net where I can get some tips?"
,manndrine,2006-08-08T15:47Z,"When I currently compress the DVD I am using the lowest setting. I can increase the zipage, but it will take longer for you to unzip... please let me know what you would prefer; as I have DVD release just about ready for upload.

So either:
 a) smaller download - longer unzip
 b) larger download - quicker unzip"
,manndrine,2006-08-08T15:48Z,"as far as what to do when you download a DVD release... google it for now. I'm in the process of creating a ""how to"""
,K1LLER,2006-08-08T20:20Z,"the quality and setup of this looks great, but how do i burn it to DVD? ive tried with nero and alcohol 120% but still cant figure it out"
,ShellShock 44,2006-08-09T05:54Z,"manndrine, sorry to question you, but I was very curious, is this the actual dvd version? :S cause its out in theaters, is this PAL or NTSC, and if this is the real version, how did you get it? lol. (PS. I dont care if its real or made, just very curious)"
,philip_j_fry,2006-08-09T08:15Z,"C'mon Shellshock.  Don't ask Manndrine to reveal that on a public web page, or his source may dry up.  Send a private message instead."
,ShellShock 44,2006-08-09T08:40Z,"My appologies, I did not mean that. Sorry"
,ShellShock 44,2006-08-09T09:26Z,P.S. manndrine check inbox lol
,Murzy,2006-08-09T14:36Z,"shellshock did you even read the info?  
""Source......: Cars.TELECINE"" so its not the real dvd, its just very well done"
,eze028,2006-08-09T17:03Z,"Excellent job, thanks alot."
,ShellShock 44,2006-08-09T19:05Z,"Oops, no, I read it, just didn't see that"
