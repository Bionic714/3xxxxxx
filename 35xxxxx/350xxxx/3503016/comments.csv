,Babbleshots,2009-11-05T18:59Z,Thank you very much :) It was downloading insanely fast! :) 
,SpaceOctopus,2009-11-28T13:58Z,"this is the second torrent today I've seen with discography spelled like this. Do your homework. I personally would be much more likely to download something spelled right, as it would seem most likely to be done well. If you use firefox, it's got freakin spellcheck built in. If not, get it!"
,mars-attack,2009-11-30T01:35Z,SpaceOctopus: you're a bloody idiot. You do know that Yann Tiersen is french right? people aren't obligated to writing things in the language that YOU understand. get your head out of your ass.
,mars-attack,2009-11-30T01:36Z,"and Fixazo, thanks for this torrent! =)"
,audiobully88,2010-01-23T00:02Z,Yeah makes it a bit harder to find 
,Omnipharious,2010-05-07T07:08Z,"I pretty much just discovered Yann, but so far I LOVE HIM. I'm gonna download it, and I'll seed it too."
,Omnipharious,2010-05-07T07:11Z,"Oh yeah, and SpaceOctopus: You're a fucking idiot. He's fucking French, having mostly French fans, you're bound to see his discography spelled ""Discographie,"" you fucking half-wit. English isn't the only language out there, du duff arscholch."
,JaZZano,2010-05-16T13:21Z,"Many thanks, U have just made my day:)"
,latinloopyloo,2010-09-23T12:59Z,Please seed!!!

,mozartkiller,2011-10-17T19:02Z,"@SpaceOctopus : Discographie means Discography in French, and Yann Tiersen is French. So maybe you could read a bit about the artist before yelling next time !"
