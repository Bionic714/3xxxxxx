This was my first attempt at making a demo DVD, and features my favourite demos of all time.

People have mentioned the MindCandy project and the similarities, but I must stress that Mindcandy was in no way my inspiration for this.
I actually did something similar to this back in the mid-nineties on VHS, so the seed of the idea was planted LONG before Mindcandy was even thought about.

And anyway, this is free!

These demos were all captured from a real Amiga 1200 via an external MPEG encoder.

The actual size of the DVD would have been over 10Gigs without cutting down on the quality of the demos!!

The Demos will all play concurrently, so you can just start the first one from the menu, then leave it to run through them all.

The menu is pretty basic, and the music on the menu is at quite a loud level compared to the demos.

That little niggle aside, I was quite pleased with the outcome, and the quality of the demos didn't suffer that much.
(thanks to DVD Shrink 3.2!)

This image is best burnt at speeds of 4x or lower, otherwise you may get video stutter.

Anyway, enjoy this nostalgic look back at the vibrant Amiga Demo scene.

Hope you enjoy this effort, and look out for my other productions.
