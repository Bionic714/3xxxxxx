If it needs seeding, leave a comment next to the episode (I re-visit older uploads to ensure at least someone (me) is seeding my uploads)

,insanemofo,2011-02-06T04:58Z,"There's a 350MB English version of ep 17 here, in widescreen from an HD source.

The magnet link is the only link there that works, though."
,imzima,2011-05-22T19:01Z,"thank you very much Mr. Epinephrine43
i have always found cold case a unique type of TV series that focuses less on the star characters and instead delves into the lives of those affected by long forgotten crimes.
frodogirl and SOBB3029 also deserve a mention for pointing out errors in e17. big props for aiding out fellow members of this great torrent community"
,MofoMan2000,2011-05-29T18:55Z,Wtf is wrong with the DivX compression? It leaves a bunch of random dots all over the screen during the whole episode. Or is it my codec? Does anyone else have a link to a good codec for these movies?
