FS2004 -Flight1 Super80 [Re-Seed on Request]
--------------------------------------------

Package contains extracted installer and cracked gauge file. 

The official wrapper cannot be unwrapped using any available unwrapper. So, I guess this is your only way to get it working.

This package is untested. I've seen it work (looked good) but haven't flown the aircraft as it does not fall in my sphere of interest.

Please feel free to report any problems. Though I won't promise I'll do anything to resolve your problems.

Cheers,
FlightMaster
