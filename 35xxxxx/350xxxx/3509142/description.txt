Here it is X3 Reunion.

If there's such a thing as a realistic space sim, X3: Reunion is it. It's flat-out gorgeous. It's also intensely complex, and unlike the Wing Commander and Freelancer titles of old, X3: Reunion is notoriously unfriendly to newcomers. But if you're willing to invest the time and effort, you'll be treated to some amazingly deep gameplay: space combat, buying and selling, ship building, police, pirates and more, across an enormous universe of 130 sectors. There is a story, too, but you needn't follow it. you can choose your own path, profession - be a trader or mercenary if you want - it's up to you.
