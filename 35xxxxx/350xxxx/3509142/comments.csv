,thatguykalem,2008-03-09T23:24Z,"1. There is no tutorial. It's designed for people who know what they're doing (it pretty much said this in the description)

2. @Laofse, the only reason I'm downloading this game is because I've played Freelancer and to be honest - while it was good - it wasn't very in-depth, and at times it got boring. The story (which was fantastic) aside, the game was kinda stunted. I have a feeling that X3 is a game that is REALLY in-depth. 130 sectors? Freelancer had about 50, and there wasn't really an incentive to become a trader, pirate or do-gooder. I only really traded when I needed money..."

You don't need the crack for this game. The best thing to do is install it (but don't run it), then download and install the 1.0->2.5 patch from the official site, that's all you have to do."
,craigc2006,2008-04-26T05:50Z,whats wrong with your torrent stops at 73.6 and it took forever to get there

This is the best space sim and will be the best for many years to come... its a game you need to use alot of time on to understand... actualy, i would advice everyone to try out the first release first... to get the story from the beginning. its called ""X Beyond the frontier"""

,mws257,2008-10-28T01:55Z,"Perhaps I'm missing something here! 

But this has got to be the worst space sim I have ever seen or played.....It is poorly thought out and the game play is dreadful to say the least. 

The address the bugs well they are endless to the point where the game has become unplayable.....

For example the trading side......If I buy, say, meat from a cattle farm there is nowhere to sell it. If I buy gas from a processing plant they tell that they do not buy products.

If I choose the otherside where I shoot the pirates etc.....To see just one pirate or the like would be a start...I haven't found one to shoot....

If I use the jumpdrive I end up back where I started.....It doesn't work....

To address the missions, well this is the biggest joke of all...there's aren't any to accommodate the beginner in a beginners craft....They don't exist.

Thank GOD for piratebay...If I had actually paid for this garbage I'd be seething with fury.....

What a load of garbage this product is...I feel so sorry for the people that actually parted with cash for this crap!"
,Playa174,2008-11-02T12:15Z,"@mws257

Lol wtf? For me this game is brilliant! There were no bugs like you told, everything is great - the graphics, gameplay, ships!!!!! It's way better than Freelancer i admit. So stfu and stop saying that games suck! If you didnt like it then GTFO and find your own....

Playa."
,mws257,2008-11-05T00:33Z,Apparently Playa174 if you read the forums on the x3 website you'll note that there are a lot of bugs......This product is not ready for general release.....I know I've played them all...and when I say it's crap I base my opinion on experience....IT IS CRAP!

has anyone checked and can confirm this?"
,theris,2009-09-17T03:41Z,"okay. so i did what was advised - applied the 1.0 -> 2.5 official patch and didn't use the crack at all.

and yes, it seems to be working.. i played a while, went through a jumpgate, just cruised a little. it didn't block me out nor crashed. i need the manual though, figuring out the controls by myself would take too long, plus i don't like the inverted mouse steer but don't know how to switch it to normal.

if i get a grip on controls and like the game, i might actually go pay for it."
,Fox_Almighty,2009-12-08T07:38Z,"Game works great, read the comments here and used some of them...

I re-made the image adding in the latest updated patch (from 1.0 to 2.5) and the bonus package file (3.1 or something) and burnt it to a dvd single layer (came up to 4.1gb), installed the game, installed the update patch, installed the bonus package and took the dvd out of the drive and just played the game... no cracks needed.

Note: I'm a huge freelancer fan, I've played other space flying games, so this one is easy to figure out the controls (and customize a few of them) but I have no idea what to do in the game or how to do it, lol. I want to kill something or make a trade route or build or customize something other then my name :'("
,Fox_Almighty,2009-12-08T07:58Z,"Note: if it's your first time playing, don't be an idiot like me and chose custom game... it doesn't come with storyline and makes it harder to learn how to do anything.

As stated elsewhere, don't use the included crack or the patch. Just download the latest '1.0 to 2.5 update' and it'll run just fine, without any need to mount the CD - Obviously you'll have to mount the disc to install the game! :)

Dameon Tools Lite is available for free download (google it!) ALso there is an excellent mod for X3 called Xtended - find it here: http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-x-tended-mod

Lots of additional ships to add to the game here: http://cycrow.thexuniverse.us/ships/

Get the X-Plugin Manager to install cheat+ scripts here: http://forum.egosoft.com/index.php?c=2

Also, get the X3-Bonus Package from the above egosoft forums.
