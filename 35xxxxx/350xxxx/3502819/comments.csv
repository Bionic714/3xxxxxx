,PowerSupply,2007-01-29T01:56Z,"Could someone please rapidshare or seed a torrent of just the language files in this download (the ""lang"" folder). I need the file swedish.zip but I don't feel to download hundreds of megabytes just to get hold of a file that's under 100k. I'm sure many more would like this since a lot of languages are missing in the other iGO torrent."
