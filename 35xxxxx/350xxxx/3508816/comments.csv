,Mr_Ecks,2006-07-31T13:55Z,Is it PAL or NTCS?
,Mr_Ecks,2006-07-31T23:24Z,"Killawife>> Get a life or at least a reality check. Do live on mars? I know it sounds strange, but there are other things than porn."
,thrawn77,2006-08-01T00:32Z,"This torrent is posted under PORN -> DVDR... 
dumb-ass."
,Mr_Ecks,2006-08-01T21:26Z,"Well I can assure You, I for one get impure thoughts watching Miss Portman."
,uraphake,2006-08-01T23:12Z,So...does anyone know if this is NTSC or PAL yet?
,mikalimkiki,2006-08-01T23:44Z,How come this is posted in this area? Either the UL-er can't read or don't understand english...
,uraphake,2006-08-02T04:00Z,"Who gives a shit why it's in the porn section?
The important thing is that it was posted ahead of the commercial release date (clue!).

Now -- is it NTSC or PAL?"
,tjabo99,2006-08-02T14:39Z,"Dont u know why we get mad when its uploaded in wrong section? When i write V or V for in search field, it doesnt find  this movie at all and my first section to look for it isnt under porn, get a grip plz and upload under right section...Think be4 post a comment next time"
,NoP0int,2006-08-03T21:32Z,Is this the nude edition with Mrs. Portman :-) 
,Bjorkved,2006-08-04T13:03Z,Fan va skönt att äntligen få se en redig P-stänkare med Natalie Portman!!! :)
,uraphake,2006-08-08T14:00Z,"Another clue: Put a check in the box next to ""all"" and you will find ""Vendetta"" before you find ""Vagina.""
Works great -- try it!"
,encyn,2006-08-12T04:42Z,"It's NTSC, and while I haven't watched the entire disc yet, it looks great.

And I agree that this should be re-categorized out of the porn section."
,dmfyrespray,2006-08-23T02:42Z,If this is porn you got a sickass festish...
,oktan,2006-09-10T19:42Z,V for vagina ???
