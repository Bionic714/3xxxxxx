,Parneix,2006-12-07T20:35Z,"Though I had no problem reading this file with VLC Media Player, Windows Media Player 9 or BSPlayer, I seriously doubt that it's XviD. I think it was made with a WMV video codec. If this is correct, it means that it is not MPEG4 and CAN'T be played on a standalone DVD player that supports DivX or XviD."

Hmmmm, strange. 
You should download the link above and check out the differences."
