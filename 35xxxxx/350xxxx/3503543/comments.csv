,harepusulv,2006-08-07T11:51Z,"I can`t burn it with Nero , iget some kind of error It says somtihing about  a vob file is out of range, some one any suggestion"
,marcha,2006-08-14T13:57Z,"This is the first time I'm dealing with a dvd with so many parts, so I have no idea how to burn it. Could someone help me please? Thanks"
,marcha,2006-08-14T15:33Z,"Also, only files from 1-29 are winrar files. Others are like .r30, .r31, .r32 etc. Is this how it's suppose to be? I'm sorry if my questions are a little stupid, but I have never came across with something like that before. I'm in a dead end and requesting help:)"
,Muhaja,2006-08-16T17:26Z,"marcha: You need the program WinRar first. If the numbers start at 0 you doubleclick the rar file without a number, if the numbers start at 1 you doubleclick that one. Then you choose where to extract the image file inside, after it has been extracted you can burn it."
,marcha,2006-08-16T22:08Z,"Yeah, I already figured that out when I was waiting for a reply. Thanks anyway. However I dowloaded another similar dvd in the mean-time and extracted the .r10 file not the first one. The movie seems to work fine, but there was supposed to an audio commentary availible also and I don't have it. So did I extract the wrong file?"
,Cabanaman,2006-08-24T22:19Z,"I've downloaded and am seeding, but I don't understand how to combine all these files."
