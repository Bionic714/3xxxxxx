,samwb123,2011-07-30T00:07Z,"Yay, this works! Unlike some other [cracked?] Chessmaster versions, this one doesn't crash when opening two tabs (e.g. File, Edit, Game, Actions, Help, etc.) one after another while playing a chess game, in Windows 7 and Vista.

Also, 9000 is the best Chessmaster version in my opinion. This is better than 8000 (which crashes), CM10 was a failure, and the Grandmaster Edition is slow, and doesn't have very good 2D boards (which I prefer to the 3D ones).

The only problem is that maybe once out of 5 times, when you analyze a chess game, it goes really fast through each move, then when you use the Auto-Annotation tool, the mentor says that each move made by each side was bad (for example, it will say ""Uh oh!"" or ""Look out!"" before the commentary on each move.) When this happens, try saving the game, then restarting Chessmaster and analyze the game again."
