,lokito500,2006-08-05T06:29Z,its my first time...tell me how to take super off....thanks
,ktm7,2006-08-08T14:53Z,"Look from settings, if there is marker in ""super seed"" take it away. And you can use less upload slots too, 5-6 is fine more than that is too much if you dont have fast connection (upstream)"
