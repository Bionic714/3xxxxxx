,NinjaWanker,2006-07-16T16:23Z,I get no sound on part 2 ep 1. Is there some special codec needed?

,penol738,2006-07-17T01:12Z,"finally! great! and thanks! 

episodes ""2"" and ""4"" are swedish-subtitled (I don't mind), and a few of them are kind of crappy in quality, but watchable for sure!

If you have trouble watching them, try VideoLAN"
