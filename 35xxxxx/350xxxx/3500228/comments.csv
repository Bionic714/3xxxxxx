,OzzKiNgZ,2006-07-02T09:39Z,thanks :)
,Harvesterz,2006-07-02T18:04Z,"Thank You Sir

Much Appreciated!"
,Buckaroo55,2006-07-09T09:58Z,thank you FaeGin. If you got more Dylan stuff....put it on. 
,theTwinWithin,2006-07-09T13:04Z,Thanks. Can you please provide us with the track listing?
,jetpilot,2006-07-10T11:02Z,my download stops at 53% the torrent is downloaded 88 times with 0 seeders and 23 leechers. very nice indeed! thanks to the selfish guys that stop after they have the 100% A real Pirate mentality
,R2/D2,2006-07-10T23:15Z,"I agree with you, jetpilot. This torrent is already stone cold dead after one week! This is an example of how to kill a torrent in one week. Shame on you who won't seed."
,keithdylan,2006-07-11T02:25Z,"I think there is something wrong with this torrent.  I don't understand how it can be stopped at 54% when 161 people downloaded it and there are 3 seeders, and my torrent window says there are 99.5% distributed copies out there.  Those numbers just don't add up.  Not even on pirate bay would that many completed people abandon the torrent.  I've uploaded shows much less popular that have lasted for months. "
,Buckaroo55,2006-07-11T03:11Z,There must be blood on the tracks.  I'm stuck at 54%. This torrent need a little help
,jetpilot,2006-07-11T19:47Z,"Hey FaeGin, maybe it's a good idea to react to some questions asked. Like tracklistings, dates and venues. Maybe the material we are so desperate trying to DL is existing and available already.
Thanks for putting up the torrent though."
[T],FaeGiN,2006-07-18T13:04Z,damnit. I just answered the questions and keep getting a friggin' databnase error when I submit the comment. Maybe cos' its too long? Will keep trying.
[T],FaeGiN,2006-07-18T13:06Z,"OK it seems I have to keep the coments short!
CAN SOMEONE TELL ME IF THEY HAVE MANAGED TO DOWNLOAD THIS?
IS IT STILL STUCK AT 54% or some other%?
LEt me know please!"
,jez_moxey,2006-07-20T13:44Z,does anyone here recall a torrent from here of rare official dylan?

,hotburrito,2006-10-10T13:37Z,"Much nicer cover for this on http://www.cdcovers.cc
Search for Bob Dylan The Man In Video Volume 1 in dvd section and download."
,hotburrito,2006-10-12T08:37Z,The menu doesn't work :(
[T],FaeGiN,2006-11-04T00:20Z,"Funny how only one idiot sees fit to say 'the menu doesn't work' and yet I KNOW it does.
Try educating yourself or even getting a DVD player that works instead of bringing your negative and wrong comments here."
,Chiklod,2009-01-04T03:35Z,Thanks for the effort!
