,MPG187,2007-12-14T02:17Z,"Anyone have a serial for Battery Pack? I tired serial.ws and they didnt work, and that site is infested with bad ads, I came there for warez not gross pictures!!

How come most serial sites and rom sites have bad stuff there, since when does a rom have anythign to do with a naked person (real or animated)?
It's sick"
,panzerhue,2008-02-26T18:34Z,Infected by Trojan.Progent http://securityresponse.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2003-072515-4207-99&tabid=1
,tpbaddict,2008-10-29T02:06Z,"All in all it's a good package. The only downside is that one file in the package is infected. So be careful and read the previous comments. Also some apps are outdated, check for the latest version before you install. Also check for more Pocket PC freeware at http://www.pocketpcfreeware.org/ 

Peace :)"
,tpbaddict,2008-10-29T02:09Z,"By the way, the title of this torrent is a bit confusing. I would recommend to name it something like ""Software package for Pocket PC, ver. 1.0"". The ""PDA"" term has a broader sense than this. PDAs include Palm OS based devices and some more based on another platforms... Just for your information :)"
,Marcyss,2009-01-15T21:17Z,Thanks! I would consider deleting the virus and upload again ?
,r3dsurf,2009-07-30T12:52Z,"So..
i know it is understood that Resco Keyboard Pro v4.35+KEY
contains a virus, but when i ran this file through virustotal, it found bunches of others. 
Link( http://www.virustotal.com/analisis/75f706bc7c6177384383437a47bee5ab74f9360975a659c161127488e9859d16-1248950679 )
 Idk if it is because cracks or whatever are causing false positives, but its enough to scare me into not wanting to try these on my Windows mobile phone, which is a shame because i was pretty excited.

Can anyone explain?

Or Does anyone know of an updated version of this torrent with the most handy popular WM5 Apps?"
