This set can just be squeezed to 3 CDs:
CD 1: DVD 1 tracks 1-11
CD 2: DVD 2 tracks 1-12
CD 3: DVD 1 tracks 12-16, DVD 2 tracks 13-17

Note that I left off Moby Dick (DVD 1, track 7) - Sorry, for
myself I couldn't listen to it over & over in the car.

Also left off Immigrant Song (DVD 2, track 1) since it's the
exact same version that's on How The West Was Won, which
any fan probably has already.

Make sure your CD burner is set for NO 2-second silence between
songs, for the best flow.
