It's better to go through all System Services in Windows and stop/remove the ones not used.

,Kaluleomorir,2006-08-03T14:05Z,"Sjaakie2:
Where can I find or how can I recognize Windows XP (2003) ? Thks."
,Andreas16,2006-11-26T18:16Z,"Thank you very much you rock:-)
Keep up the good work!"
,mrhex,2006-12-20T16:34Z,"Thanks.
Windows may have decenemt memory management, but games and software still have memoryleaks and will even after application shutdown hog and/or limit system resources.
I have found using software like memturboÂ´s ""scrub"" function helps me get a snappier system without having to reboot."
,Dersh,2008-03-14T00:17Z,"Actually memory managers are useful. I play pc games, and I have 4gb of ram. Now when you have a game that uses anywhere from 1-2gb of ram and it crashes, the ram is not properly cleared duh. Which usually results in another crash later after an application or game has been relaunched.

Not to mention if your using Windows Vista, you need 1/3-2/3 more ram than Windows XP for ANY application. So enjoy your Windows Vista, which you get screwed into if you ever buy a new pc. I build my own computers, its easy hah. 

You actually can set the pagefile size in windows yourself or set it to No pagefile so big deal for linux. So memory managers have their place even if you do not think so."
,Mike727,2008-11-04T21:41Z,"Dude, Windows XP is so archaic. Vista is a far superior OS to XP. And any decent, newer computer can handle Vista with no problem. I run it on my laptop with just a gig of ram, and it runs just as smooth as XP, with fewer crashes and better accesibility. It has its flaws, but it's the best thing MS has to offer."
,terorvlad,2009-08-08T16:48Z,nice seeding ! keep it up*loading* :D

  Don't knock XP because its old. It is fully capable of doing anything Windows Vista/7 can do, and do it using less hardware. I myself have ran XP SP1 on a Pentium B 120MHz processor with 80mb of RAM. And I did it using Progman vs. the ever memory hogging (Internet)Explorer GUI, and using MemTurbo 2.1. Personally, I think Vista and 7 are epic failures, because MS failed to remove the the one mistake that has been plaguing PC users since 95OSR2/98. IE integration.

  Making an OS that views the hard drive as a web page is just stupid, and dangerous on to many levels to count. That's why I'm experimenting with React OS. It runs just about all of your favorite XP apps on a 100MHz Processor, 32mb of Ram using 200mb of hard drive space, and best of all: No Internet Explorer. All for $0.00.  Sure you can install IE if you want, but that kind of defeats the purpose of React OS."
,whazzup3929,2010-01-26T03:02Z,this is at Mike727  vista is THE worst OS that has ever existed so 10you either just started using a computer with vista and you only need it for the calculator or 2)you use it as a paperweight... cause that is all vista is good for..it is a memory hog and a piece of shit...xp 2nd edition is the fkn bomb... NEVER had any problems with it.. now vista for other people(like us pirates)we open multiple tab browse the internet while unwinraring multiple files while open disk images..vista hates that...anyway kudos to UL TYVM
