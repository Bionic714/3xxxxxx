,df129,2007-01-23T02:44Z,Would you happen to have megacity Atlanta?
,the1who,2009-09-06T12:17Z,"Even since January 2007, there still hasn't been a successful seed going on here, that's 2 1/2 years at least, not to go back to July 2006, that's a ridiculous 3 years. We can't seed it if no one else can even download 100%. So why's this torrent even here still? I'd like it but it seems this torrent is dead."
,gotbutchi,2011-01-16T18:08Z,"Let me add more than a year later,it's still 49,4% and this is the only megacity that has not been seeded properly.

Thanks for the upload. But no thanks to 49,4% for more than 4 years ^^!"
,magdog28,2011-01-16T19:34Z,"Hey guys if anyone can get there hands on a copy of this, I may have some stuff in return that I don't see being seeded here on TPB!"
,gotbutchi,2011-01-24T19:01Z,"I really need this,but waiting for 4 years and still at 49%. Hell I'm pissed!

Well,some days before I've seen 1 seed but can't connect with them,I think nobody can."
