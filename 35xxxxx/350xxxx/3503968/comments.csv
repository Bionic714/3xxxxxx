Connect your TomTom Go/Rider/One to your PC using the supplied USB cable. 
If TomTom Home does not automatically load then please start it now. 
Use TomTom Home to make a back-up of your SD Card (please see TomTom Home's instructions for how to do this) 
Once your card is backed up you can minimise TomTom Home 
Open 'My Computer' by either double clicking the icon on your desktop or by selecting it from the Start Menu (dependent on what version of Windows you are using) 
Your TomTom should now be visible in 'My Computer' as a 'Removable Disk' 
Open the drive, by double-clicking it, and then open the folder called 'Great_Britain-Map' (if you have only UK maps) or 'Western_Europe-Map' (if you have full european maps) 
Locate the folder where you extracted the speed camera files to in #5 there should be numerous files, depending on which set you downloaded, called 'pocketgps_uk_xxxx' and a few others with the license agreement and help files 
Select all of the 'pocketgps_uk...' files by clicking on the first one and then, while holding shift, click on the last one 
Now, copy the files by holding 'CTRL' and pressing 'c' 
Go back to the 'Great_Britain-Map'/'Western_Europe-Map' folder and paste the files by holding 'CTRL' and pressing 'v'. You have now transferred the files to your TomTom. 



You now need to 'enable' the cameras on the TomTom so you can see them on the map. Select them in your POI categories by going to: 'Change Preferences' then 'Manage (or Maintain) POI' then 'Enable / Disable POI' (the exact wording will depend on your TomTom unit) 
Select each POI in turn. 



You now need to set up proximity warnings for each camera type by going to: ' Change Preferences' then 'Manage (or Maintain) POI' then 'Warn when near POI ' 
Select each POI in turn and choose the warning distance and the warning sound 
Uncheck the ""Warn only if POI is on route"" box so that you still get alerts if you are not navigating 
Repeat steps 20-22 until all POIs are set up to warn.
