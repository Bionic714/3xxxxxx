,rrodger99,2006-07-08T19:59Z,That is a codec issue...google for divx or k-lite codec pack or acemegacodec pack & install that.....I would just get the divx codec by itself rather than the packs.
,jueljuel,2006-07-08T21:04Z,Thanks a lot rrodger99! Ill try that. You're so helpful!
,jueljuel,2006-07-08T21:29Z,"Yes yes yes, thanks rrodger99, now I also can see these great videos!!"
