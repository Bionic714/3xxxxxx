,rrodger99,2006-07-13T04:59Z,"Just flew the scenery & the only thin I see missing is some jetways on the express side for the ERJ & CRJ.

They included the old tower on top of B & the new tower where I worked on top of the main concourse.

Many thanks to Kenyo for the fast response & a great job doing the rip."
