,plexer,2006-07-31T22:13Z,Thanks...Keep the HDTV movies coming!
,dr.cook,2006-11-26T13:30Z,how on earth do you play it?
,gatorfreak,2007-01-13T16:13Z,"WARNING!!! This has both English and some other language as subtitles that cannot be turned off.  The video quality is excellent but if I'd known there are two languages of subtitles cluttering up the screen, I would not have wasted my time downloading this."
,rc71,2007-03-04T07:32Z,See that .SRT file?  Delete it and no more subtitles.  BTW that means you CAN turn it off.
,phullscreen,2007-04-28T05:17Z,"This doesn't seem to work properly...
i tried opening it with VLC and
i can't get any sound and the video skips
dramatically from 1 scene to another..???

Anybody experiencing issues?"
,hurrafor,2007-07-22T17:43Z,"ABSOLUTELY works....you just have to do a little digging:

First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.

Install those and report back!"
,kkendall,2007-09-06T13:27Z,Why do I need HDTVPump to play this file? What is so specific about it that it requires this program??
