,wilmpunk,2006-07-16T16:15Z,Reseed plz?
,Son Of Mogh,2006-07-18T23:55Z,"What Uru games are these exactly? I have Myst, beyond Uru already, but I'm qurious about this one. Will download it, if you will continue to seed. Thnx in advance!"
,silentthunder,2006-07-20T19:36Z,"Please seed, there are about 30 peers and everyone is stuck at 63.4%
If you could just seed until i finish downloading i will continue to seed for a few weeks."
,tarranon,2006-07-21T22:00Z,"Please, someone seed this.  Everyone is stuck."
,softoff,2006-07-22T18:32Z,"Son Of Mogh, according to www.mobygames.com/game/windows/uru-complete-chronicles it's ""a re-release of Uru: Ages Beyond Myst, packed in with the commercial Path of the Shell and the free To D'Ni addons"".
Maybe this upload was never meant to be finished..."
,fnog,2006-07-25T00:49Z,seed
,sweetb_72,2006-07-29T08:45Z,I'm sorry about the seed if it's incomplete.  I'll be back to seeding it on August 1st.  Thanks for your patience.
,winstonwsmith,2006-07-29T20:06Z,"Thank you, sweetb_72.  I have this game, but the first disc got so scratched I can't get it to work anymore.  You're a freaking lifesaver."
,Imaroth,2006-07-29T22:13Z,"hmm.. alright, you know what that means, Everyone make sure to get your torrent-program open. :p sweetb_72, thanks."
,Imaroth,2006-08-01T14:23Z,Anytime now.
,sweetb_72,2006-08-01T18:36Z,"For whatever reason, I no longer have the torrent file.  The Pirate bay won't let me download it for some reason.  If you got it, email it to sweetb_72@hotmail.com then I can continue to seed it.  Thanks."
,Imaroth,2006-08-01T19:30Z,"I did send it to you, if it works, just make sure one of us gets the full download so that we can all worship your greatness and start chain-seeding the torrent. :p"
,sweetb_72,2006-08-01T19:35Z,Got it.  Seeding...
,Imaroth,2006-08-01T19:39Z,"Zomg, I'm about to hug you. T-T
-cries-
You-are-my-hero! =D

I'll make sure to stay on, even though it's midnight here, once I get it, I will go to sleep, so I'll be able to seed the whole day tomorrow.

Again, thanks! =D"
,Imaroth,2006-08-01T19:53Z,"Naw, wait, I'll just leave it on the whole night. Apparently 5 hrs to go, can you stay on that long, sweetb_72?"
,Imaroth,2006-08-01T19:53Z,"Ugh, my mistake.. 2 hrs >_"
,Imaroth,2006-08-02T10:15Z,"Okay, I'm seeding, but it seems I either need a nocd crack somewhere or I need to burn the main disc. As far as I can see there is no crack provided."
,Imaroth,2006-08-02T21:32Z,"Alright, probably my last reply here.

For those who get this, I used Nero to burn the images, but mounting them should work as well. Nero is adviced though. Once you get that done got to this topic.

Ubisoft released a patch for the 'error incorrect cd in drive' or something along that line. Download it, do as told, and amaze yourself in the ages Uru offers you. (Die hard Myst fans, or those just starting, google 'the myst reader', a book that is well-readable and the most simple way to get an explanation about the D'ni culture."
,skunk_burner,2007-04-02T18:52Z,"dude,
this wont work without cd crack,
some one no where to find it ???
Thanks"
,lalala1,2007-04-04T06:02Z,"Thank you!

I bought all the other ones but couldnt find this one on direct download or in stores. For some stupid reason all the EbGames stores only stock the add on--not the original.  "
,egonosum,2007-04-09T23:28Z,"Please, can anybody tell me how to run this game?
I have loaded the torrent, burn the two CDs, but when I try to start the game I get a message telling me:

'Please insert the correct CD-ROM, slect OK and restart application'

I've tried switching CD1 and CD2 but still I get the same message.

Some tip?

/egonosum"
,Nerd42,2007-08-28T16:22Z,"It installs fine but I'm also getting the ""wrong CD"" error no matter what patches I try."
,ACKU,2007-08-30T22:44Z,"I´ve tried everything to get this to work but it just won´t. It just shows ""Please insert the correct Cd, select OK and restart application"".  Could someone please find a Crack, would be really appreciated.

PS. The Patch doesn´t work either!"
,Imaroth,2008-02-10T18:03Z,Downloading once again and seeding afterwards. Seems like I just can't drop this game. Too bad they won't continue Myst Online though. But even in SinglePlayer this game is quite amazing.
,MaxwellO,2008-03-03T17:43Z,"Downloaded and installed the game OK. But when I get to the device which normally should trigger Yeesha's story, I can only see Yeesha for a couple of seconds and I can't get the fifth sign from her. Has anyone encountered a similar problem? I would appreciate any suggestions."
,NaturallyX,2008-03-05T08:00Z,"Ok, so i downloaded the fiule and mounted it with Daemon tools. I am running windows Vista. Does anyone know how to load both discs on daemon? I'm getting a problem when it tells me to insert the second disc. It asks for a path. When i put in the correct path, it tells me it's invalid. Thanks..."
,NaturallyX,2008-03-06T18:10Z,"GOT IT WORKING AND FOUND MANY GLITCHES IN P.O.T.S. DON'T GET DISCOURAGED IF YOU GET STUCK. JUST JUMP TO RELTO AND LINK BACK. 

THANKS AGAIN FOR THE D/L."
,MaxwellO,2008-03-25T17:48Z,"I've downloaded the game again and it works fine but I can't get Yeesha to deliver her message. She appears for about 3 seconds and then disappears without leaving the fifth cloth. I suppose there's something wrong with what I'm doing. Please, please, help!!!!"
,MaxwellO,2008-04-09T11:36Z,"I'm still stuck at the beginning, not being able to get the fifth sign from Yeesha. Come on people, have a heart!!! I've done everything by the book and I still get stuck here without the possibility of continue the game. Please, please help!!!!"
,ahref,2008-05-07T21:30Z,"MaxwellO, Please check your inputting the correct series of symbols these are behind a plank of wood near the door. Also make sure the door is closed.

if she babbles in D'ni for more then a few seconds then the combination is wrong."
,Jaylund,2008-05-11T09:50Z,I have installed with demon tools and every time I try to run it says Please install the correct disk and restart application. How do I go around this?
,morfasias,2008-05-16T17:13Z,Downloaded it successfully but when i try to launch it. It says that it can't find the CD. Please help me. 
,morfasias,2008-05-16T17:27Z,i have the same problem as jaylund.
,ugaboj,2008-05-17T10:18Z,i too have the same problem

This site has the crack. Copy it and paste in where you have your uru files. I did it and it works for me."
,ahref,2008-05-30T00:41Z,"Maxwell are you getting the symbols right?

Close the door also.

If she babbles in dni its wrong."
,Maxwell_O,2008-08-23T08:18Z,"Ahref, in the meantime I've uninstalled the game but I'll download it again and I'll give it a new try, though I'm sure I did everything properly. Thanks for the tip."
,Blade_Saoki,2009-02-07T17:54Z,"Can't believe this.. I'm actually the dude called 'Imaroth' who wrote at page 1. Yet again I'm downloading this for the third time. I really can't get enough of it, it seems.

Thanks for the continued upload since 2006. I'm going to prepare for the open source URU which will launch July 2009."
,earlneedshelp,2009-08-15T14:46Z,I downloaded and installed the game .  It wont start.  asks for correct cd.  any help?  I tried to go to the link that was posted and got an error.
,nilcrabaniel,2009-08-18T12:08Z,http://help.support.ubi.com/UruCC_n.zip  hope it works :D
,denbal87,2011-11-21T23:20Z,"Thanks a lot! It works perfectly so far!!! To those who are having ""insert the correct CD"" problem: Google ubisoft patch for Uru! Replacing a few files with the ones from the patch will fix the problem! Thanks again!!!"
,Qajs1,2011-11-28T01:50Z,Omg. I lost CD2 and Idk what the hell to do. This download is taking FOREVER. I don't even think it's worth it..
