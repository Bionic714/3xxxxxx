Walter and Anna want a home of their own. When Walter's real estate agent friend offers him what looks like the perfect home, Anna and Walter buy it. The house has many problems; structural, plumbing, electrical... These problems only come to light after they've moved in. Hence, the house is a 'money pit'. Also worthy of note are the comical builders and the terrible ex husband, Max, who still chases Anna.
