,docfrasse,2006-07-30T21:22Z,"jemaso, yes I agree but they donÂ´t have it. One or two years ago I found a low res cover of the film at CDcovers.cc but I am looking for a better one. Thanks all the way."
,RabsRich,2008-01-08T03:08Z,I'm 99.4% & willing to continue seeding if anyone still has & would kindly help me finish.  Thanks in advance for great piece of history.
,ukmonkey,2008-01-15T23:12Z,"WARNING!!!.. NOT FREAKS, just a documentary on the film....
Speeds great too! 97.4 within two months, now after a third made it to 99.9 !!! (seeding  ratio 5 ! suppose thats a plus for all the other people i have supplied with 97.4)  
This DVD doesn't include the film!! just a documentary that has this nautious drolling naration by some bloke who has seen it!   I havn't seen Freaks and do wish to see the original.  "

Lots of downloaders are stuck on 87%.

Thanks!"
,freelust,2010-12-02T15:08Z,"Many thanks to the original uploader.

@ ukmonkey: Freaks (the film) is present as announced in the description. Before saying nonsense, you should learn to switch between audio tracks!"
