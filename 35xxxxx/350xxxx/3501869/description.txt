Title : How The War On Terror Interrupted ET Contact
Name : JIM Marrs Aztec UFO Conference

Presentation by Jim Marrs [2002] which has a couple of interesting points. 
Mostly focusing on the detailed UK crop circle formation that replied to the 
M13 radio wave message sent from South America, Jim also links JFK to an intelligence 
role earlier in his career at which time he was exposed to the ET agenda. 
This latter point is a rarely known point and alters the perspective of 
post-war politics for those researchers among us who believe the ET phenomena
 plays a far bigger role in the post Roswell era than mainstream history lets on.

More info on how the alien agenda links in with synthetic terror, consciousness
 and the drugs trade can be found at http://www.utopiated.net
