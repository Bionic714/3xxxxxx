It will be slow here for a while."
,shuffler,2006-07-09T18:28Z,TPB still haven't fixed their stats bless 'em. I'm showing 7 leechers already.
,shuffler,2006-07-11T14:18Z,Pls keep seeding once you have the file

,Ninjorp,2007-12-13T13:24Z,"I'm at 98.5%, can somebody seed this up for a bit?"
,resonator,2008-04-13T11:36Z,"shuffler, please reseed, 98,7 %."
,dmitrivada,2009-01-11T15:54Z,"At 98.7% for two days.  If anyone could seed this  for a little while I would be very grateful.  Also, do any of you know of a good torrent site other than PB or a user that focuses on lectures from the different fringe conferences around the country, like Xcon , the Bay Area UFO Conference, and the Conscious Life Expo."
