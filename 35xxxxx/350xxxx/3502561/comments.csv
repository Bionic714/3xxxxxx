,mattemeluffet,2006-11-10T22:18Z,"You who downloads this should be embarassed of your selfs, it's a show for 5-years old girls!"
,rtamsessions,2006-11-16T22:52Z,"It is not a show for five-year-old girls. In Japan, it's aimed more for teen girls, though there is no reason why adult men and women can't enjoy it. The American dubbed version is so horribly watered down compared to the original Japanese version."
,Thunderrr,2006-11-24T10:07Z,"People please, i need seed. ""mattemeluffet"" says it's for kids, and he does have a point, but my little sister is going to slaughter me if don't download this torrent :) Please offer this cartoon to my sister, and save a human life - MINE !!! :) PLEASE !!!"

I'm 26, male and will always treasure the way I feel everytime I'm watching a Sailormoon episode. 
This, for the 'watch Bleach,Naruto blah blah blah' guys! Newsflash: If you don't like Sailormoon, go  post yr meaningless comments somewhere else. How old are you anyway, 10?

Once again, thank you, thank you, thank you!"

,-Thrice-,2008-05-17T03:49Z,"First of all: If you don't intend to download this release, shut the hell up! Stop writing useless information of any kind. Second of all, seed! Common sense isn't as common as one might think."
,SamiKay,2008-05-19T00:21Z,"I've been seeding four or five days at a time oo; I also have internet that is monitored by my provider, if I upload too much per day they assume I either have a worm or I am doing just what I am; giving people stuff illegally. I've uploaded damn near 100GB So stop complaining about people seeding."
,.pinkmonster.,2008-05-23T01:18Z,"Thanks everyone that seeds, it's very much appriciated. ^^

,Captiosus,2008-08-18T20:59Z,I just learned this the hard way: Episode 29 of the Super S season is missing the subtitles. I downloaded a proper version from Veoh (you need bitcomet 1.03 to do that) so just a forewarning

Thanks for uploading this!
Will seed until ratio is 100 or so. ;)

@ ariwen

EP 90 and 167 plays just fine with VLC Player (0.8.6i) for me. Make sure you've completed the download of these, and check if you're running the latest version of VLC Player."
,Youngjaerome,2008-10-15T06:53Z,"can anyone tell me the format? avi, mkv that sort"
,Ragwing,2008-10-27T14:28Z,"They're in avi, compressed with DivX.

,Techloid,2009-06-03T03:21Z,Episode 156 has no subtitles
,DiamondDiva,2009-06-10T04:15Z,Well I must say that I am rather disappointed at the 67 seeders and 458 leechers however even tho bittorrent say it will be almost 3 weeks before this download completes it is well worth the wait! I absolutely love Sailor Moon and I used to have the complete series on DVD. I watched sailor moon everyday when I was deployed to Iraq and it got to the point that my tent buddies couldn't go to sleep until they heard the theme song! Please seed more people...My collection got lost coming back to the states! I need my Sailor Moon Fix! 
,animenutjill,2009-06-24T10:04Z,"I just wanted to know, is this the cut or uncut version? O.o I love Sailor moon and I really wanna see the REAL version of it. The damn english version cut out the juicy stuff. T__T lol"
,asuma92,2009-08-25T17:26Z,Please.. whoever can.. SEED..!!!!! I'm still at 38% from 2 months ago..
,neontiger666,2010-03-14T14:38Z,it says despite so many seeders 2 years to get this home ffs stop your netlimiter programs and let the speed up the faster the rest of us get it home the better we can seed it back. damn or do you all have dialup still ? stone age retard internet or? -.- ARGH  think it will go faster on direc connet. aka dc++..!!! FFS
,Therilith,2010-03-21T02:09Z,Second half of Ep. 23 is missing audio. Ep. 1-22 good.
,alleexo,2010-07-03T09:59Z,wish the audio wasn't so bad >_< is there a way to fix that or is that just how it is?
,carol.lopes,2011-03-21T20:59Z,"CAN YOU PEOPLE WITH 100% PLEASE SEED???????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i'm getting 5kbps for god's sake!!!!! really great that you have your files huh, but we want to download too ¬¬"
,devindanielle,2011-03-27T22:00Z,ETA is 71 days. really?
,MandyRuthless,2011-05-03T19:12Z,"Im downloading this by season. I think it takes about 1 or 2 days to download one season. It takes quite a while to finish watching one whole season, so while I'm watching one season, I'm downloading the next one. This way I dont have to wait for all the seasons to be downloaded at one time, which can take weeks. It safes me a lot of time (:

The torrent is great btw, so far I have watched 166 episodes and there's only one episode missing subtitles. I can live with that, haha ;)"
,MandyRuthless,2011-05-03T19:20Z,"PS. I'd love to seed this, but I'm quite a noob, so I'm not sure how to do so. I'm using bittorrent and after the download is completed it automatically starts uploading the file until I remove the task. Is that the same as seeding?"
,sakechan4ya,2011-06-19T04:12Z,"thanks so much for the awesome dl...I cannot wait to watch the uncut episodes of Sailor Moon, not the crappy American version^^ "
,cicer,2011-07-21T19:31Z,Please seed! 5 kB/s really? Please? I'd like to get these files.
,Bobbzorzen,2011-08-15T05:29Z,"@mandyruthless
Yes uploading the files you have finished downloaded is seeding
and uploading while downloading is leaching.

Btw if this really is as great as it seemes to be i'll definately dl and sees :D and give you a big virtual hug daelus"
,ninoscream,2011-08-16T22:49Z,PLZ !! seed !! relly want this one !!

,lordmew,2012-06-16T07:24Z,"recently got the bug that said ""watch it again, it's been 15 years since you saw it"" so that's what I'm gonna do, but I'm downloading a different, higher quality version with softsubs, I think I'll put it here once it's done... just hope that version isn't censored -_-"

,AlphaActual,2012-06-29T23:35Z,"READ THIS!

I've downloaded this torrent and I was very disappointed with the quality of the video and especially sound!(Especially the 1st season)
I've searched the internet and I found THIS,and I want to share this with you all.
1. You can watch seasons 1,2,3(C,R,S) in MUCH better quality here: http://www.animeultima.tv/search.html?searchquery=Sailor+moon
You can even download the episodes from there using program called FlvCapture.
Each episode is in MP4 format between 50-80 MB .The quality is great.

2.You can download every season(including SuperS,Stars and movies) in HIGH QUALITY(DVDrip 288 MB each season) from here:
http://sailormooncenter.net/3/torrents/
You won't regret it! Download speeds are high too! Cheers!"
,AlphaActual,2012-06-29T23:41Z,*Correction (2.) 288 MB per episode not season.Cheers!
