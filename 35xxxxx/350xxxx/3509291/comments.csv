,Bluntman1112,2006-12-19T10:02Z,How do i use an .ISO?
,Bluntman1112,2006-12-21T02:30Z,"I'm Having trouble, It's saying it can't find smackw32.dll when i click cutthroats app, and; Please insert the Cutthroats CD-ROM. If some one could help, i'd really appreciate it."
,smoq2,2007-02-02T15:40Z,Game crashes to desktop when in crow's nest for 5- 10 min. Strange. Sometimes the send/dont send error states the problem is with cutthroats.exe and sometimes cutthroats.icd :/ bump
,Manwhore_,2007-02-03T10:37Z,Can someone please re-seed this one. there are a few people stalled at 99.6% and no seeds at the moment

,X-Ray_the_Clown,2008-01-03T11:52Z,"uhh always ask for cd, what to do?"
,opaldream,2008-01-10T16:18Z,"An ISO image (.iso) is a disk image. You need a virtual cd program to make it work. It will not look for a smackw32.dll file. I am using DAEMON Tools Lite v4.11, a freeware available at http://www.disc-tools.com/download/daemon+astroburn+dtpro+sptd+hashcalc. You could use any program you want. After loading the image just run it by looking for the virtual cd drive (for example in may case I saw an additional g: drive when I opened ""My Computer""). Then you could run it as if you are installing from a CD. On my PC it ran but to fix bugs you may patch it as Ravenheart27 mentioned. Hope this helps you."
,opaldream,2008-01-10T16:39Z,"I posted comments since I am now happily playing this game that I really missed. My CD broke in half due to someone else's haphazard handling... thank you very much JacekPlacekGacek...

If you guys have problems installing this game I'll be happy to answer your questions. That is how happy it made me. And BTW, I'm an XP user too."
,vegathemega,2008-03-02T13:51Z,"ok. i installed and updated it, but still i can't play. when i get the startup thing i push play, but it says i need to put my cd-rom in:(
i know how to mount, but there was no ISO file in the download. 
Please help"
,opaldream,2008-03-12T22:12Z,"vegathemega: 
What download client are you using? when I downloaded this the only thing it contains is the .iso file. It is the entire .iso file."
,Yonda654,2008-05-22T07:35Z,"I still cant get the game to work for me, have downloaded the 7.0 patch and still says missing CD. I also tried to use the Daemon Tools Lite that opaldream suggested but nevertheless i cant seem to figure out how to use it, Please help soon."
,Mustard22,2008-10-07T02:39Z,"if anyone still has this please seed, stuck at 68.8%"
,opaldream,2008-10-24T03:45Z,"@Yonda654: (if there is any chance that you would come back to this page) if you've installed it after mounting the iso, you have to paste the cracked exe file into the installation directory. Email me at my ""spam-eating"" email add if you need help: notospam@mailinator.com

@mustard22: i burned this iso file to a dvd for storage, but I'm a noob when it comes to uploading. Tell me how and I'll seed for you or open a new torrent."
,Attakny,2008-12-30T18:33Z,"I really don't know why everyone's whinig about that this torrent doens't work.

First I downloaded with an average speed of 
127 kb/s,
 than I opened DaemonTools Lite and chose mount. I selected the only file I downloaded with this torrent and clicked ""open"". 

Then the installer screen came. Just click continue as usual and click finish. 
Then start the game.

Why is everybody having problems with this??
Thsi is one of the most well-working torrents I've ver seen.

Thanks JacekPlacekGacek!!"
