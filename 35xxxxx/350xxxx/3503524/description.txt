Questions and Answers:

Q:What is this?
A:A livecd image with Starcraft:Broodwar on it.

Q:What is this for?
A:To play the game Starcraft on about every PC with at least a cdrom player in it (and a network card to 

play on a LAN)

Q:How do I use this?
A:
1-Burn the iso to a cdrom with Nero Burning Rom or Alcohol120% or whatever application can do.

2-Boot from the cdrom (change BIOS boot setting if required)
and select press ENTER at the blue menu

3-After it is done loading, SINGLE click the computer icon on the desktop to get an explorer, run the file 
enable_ipx_bartpe.bat from the cdrom to start the IPX protocol (for multiplay)

4-watch the jpg\'s starting with number 1 and do the exact same (fix IPX for Starcraft )

5-run setup.exe inside the scbroodw folder (nocd crack)

6-run StarCraft.exe inside scbroodw (Play!)

Q:How did you make this?
A:I made a bootable cd with a WindowsXP sp2 UK image and UBCD4WIN (http://www.ubcd4win.com/)
Then I copied Starcraft:Broodwar v1.04 to the cd, with nocdcrack included, then I looked up how to get IPX 

to work with UBCD4WIN and provided instructions, and I made up some Starcraft ID\'s to play with, not 

much work at all.

Q:Can I play over Battle.net with this?
A:No, buy the game if you want to.

Q:Can I play this over the internet with friends?
A:Yes, but you and your friends needs the exact same Starcraft version (v1.04) and hamachi from 
 
http://www.hamachi.cc/

Q:Does this have sound enabled?
A:No, I don\'t know how to get sound enabled on this, I did however included a huge bunch of drivers, in the 

files \'DP_Sound_A_wnt5_x86-32_6061.7z\' and \'DP_Sound_B_wnt5_x86-32_606.7z\'

Q:Help I cannot create extra ID\'s (usernames) or save the game?!
A:That\'s right, you are running it from the cd, and since the game cannot write to the cd, it cannot create 

the ID for you, if you really need to create a new ID, copy the whole game (the \'scbroodw\' folder) to a 

medium like a harddisk or usb drive, then run it from there, you should be able to create new ID\'s now.
I did include some names to play with, so it can be run from the CD.

Q:What are all these tools included on the cd?
A:System tools to perform troubleshooting for a numerous amount of things.
Credits goto http://www.ubcd4win.com for this!

Q:Can I look and write at/to my own harddisk with this?
A:Yes.

THANKS TO:
-Microsoft for providing Windows XP, works fine (after 2 service packs and a gazillion updates that is)
-Blizzard for creating Starcraft:Broodwar, the best RTS game ever made.
-http://www.ubcd4win.com for providing me with a way to create a windows live cd with a bunch of nice

-the Twilight group, for bringing out the Twilight release containing SC:B a while ago
-RAZOR 1911: for providing the actual release

-last SC:B version with nocd crack

-simple way of storing SC:B characters on ramdisk so they can be created
