I saw the someone finally provided the Mac Rosetta Stone (sweet but now I have an intel mac and run Win natively... oh well), but ANYWAYS I have had Rosetta stone languages for a couple years since I first tried to find a Mac version. 

Format: Works for windows or Mac.  
Languages: spanish, german, french, japanese, italian, russian, chinese mandarin

The disc has Win autofiles etc, but the language packs are universal.  enjoy!
