,Sirede,2006-07-18T09:32Z,"This must be a fake, as Rosetta Spanish is allready 300MB (compressed) alone and the mandarin-chinese lvl1 should be over 500MB ...

,nottheold,2006-07-18T11:20Z,thanks for a great upload - so that people know its level 1 for each lang. thanks again

,NiteSaiya,2006-07-18T20:30Z,"How do I get this to work on Windows?
It's a .dmg filetype and a Google search says it's an OSX filetype, and I'm having trouble finding any support on using this filetype for anything but OSX or 9."

Well, then, you'd probably have to use OSX, wouldn't you think?"
,Blomvik,2006-07-29T21:44Z,"Wait, how are we gonna use this? All I can do is to open the folders with the audios in it, and listen to them.

,anaethema_x,2006-08-04T01:54Z,ummm...go to the rosetta stone website and request a sample disk...its the exact same damn thing without all this bullshit.

,rossdh,2007-03-20T16:41Z,I don't see the Mac executables on this disk.
,Mashingo,2007-04-01T12:43Z,"There is normally no executable on the Rosetta Stone (TRS) language discs. The application is a separate engine and can be downloaded elsewhere or obtained on a demo disc, for free. It is not big (application folder, when installed, is less than 20 Mb).
I guess that this torrent is no fake. If I knew how to share, I would share my own TRS language discs. But I'll tell you how to make something nice: 
1) request a demo disc with the application, or download the application from somewhere else. The demo has the advantage that all languages' text files and manuals are there, as pdf's.
2) I have a lot of TRS languages already. So I opened each language disc and copied all files to a folder on my desktop. A huge lot of files are on each language disc, but I answered ""yes"" on every prompt about ""replacing existing file?"" in order to avoid duplicates and keep the folder size limited. (when I was uncertain, I added a dot in the filename and left both files in the folder. I don't think it was necessary - anyway they did not do any harm). In the end I got a huge folder, more than 4 Gb).
I started the application and had it look for languages, but that did not work. I suspected that the application was looking for discs, so I tried a ""long shot"":
3) So I started Toast (in my case, version 6.0 Titanium), put the whole lot there, and chose ""Save as a disc image"" under the file menu.
4) That disc image worked!!! So I burned a DVD disc, a magnum gadget with more than 20 languages, many of them in two levels.
It looks really nice when opening the application... 
I see no reason for not putting even more languages into it, except for the external DVD disc size. I guess that a disc image can be quite big if it is kept in the computor or on another hardware.
5) I have a G5 PPC and a G4 laptop. It works on both. I have not tested on a PC, but I can see an additional disc icon appearing, indicating the possibility.

6) I am not a computor freak and do not even want to know technical details, that is why I have Macs. I just tested this. So I don't know how to make a torrent, I don't even understand the language (peer, seed and so on).
But I will share the DVD I made, if somebody gives me VERY detailed instructions on how to do it!

,NickP84,2007-08-05T02:08Z,"Hey,

Not sure if I'm in exactly the right place, but here goes....

I've got the Rosetta Stone app, plus the Italian language files, as well as the three .trs files. 
I've also mounted them as a disk image, but the app isn't finding it. 
It might be that I've edited the trs files wrong, or labeled, something wrong. The disk image is currently called Italian Level I. 

If anyone has got anything that will help me out, or can point me in another direction then then let me know.

Cheers!!

,enzoashley,2007-08-20T23:13Z,"Ok this obviously isnt the mac software, however i did get it from another torrent and now have it working with the iso from this torrent. i tried mounting it as a dmg but the only way i could get it to work was with  toast, ie save as disk image, once youve made it you just mount it using toast open the rosetta stone software and you can run it without any stupid cd roms"

,litehead,2008-08-07T01:16Z,I am so close!! I am saving all of the files as a disk image (using Toast) and then mounting the disk image. The Rosetta app still doesn't recognize the disk in use whether I burned a physical disk or not. What could possibly be going wrong?

,PolishPauL,2008-10-15T05:01Z,"When i try to use the patch on the demo, it does not want to install. Any ideas?"
,PolishPauL,2008-10-15T17:26Z,"I got it to work with the downloaded app, not the cd. It was very easy. All you need is Toast. All your files should be iso's.

First you click on image file in Toast and select the app. Then click mount. Once its mounted, double click the icon on your desktop and it will install.

Next I did the languages. Once the app is installed, it asks you to add languages. Mount the file the same way you did with the app. You can leave all of them mounted and it will let you pick one at a time with the install.

For the patch, first do the dmg file, then do the patch."
,oceanjam,2008-11-09T16:23Z,"I downloaded the following torrent and ran it just fine http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4371155

After that, I ran the updater and patch without any problems http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4370199/Rosetta.Stone.V3.2.Update__amp__Patch_for_Mac

I have no previous versions of RS installed ever so I don't have any of the languages. I'm trying to install languages from this torrent. But I can't seem to get the languages on.

I've burned them onto a cd to no avail since RS won't recognize the disc named 'languages'.

Is there a way to fool RS into thinking that the languages are installed? Meaning can I just copy the language files into a location in the RS app somewhere?"
,j_rat,2008-12-11T06:03Z,"this is a windows disc. which means mac users wont be able to use it unless we find out where to put the language packs found on the disk.

does anyone know how to manually install a language pack ??"
,Ramune679,2009-01-14T19:56Z,"I downloaded a pack of a bunch of languages that is just the files (audio, i assume picture, etc..) they are labeled ITA, CHI, JAP, SPA, etc. will this allow me to use the program with those languages?"

,Mashingo,2009-04-21T05:57Z,"For those not getting it working, or talking about fakes:

Most of the files in the different language packs are similar between the languages, and they have to be in the pack in one copy only. A several-language set is therefore not as large as the sum of the individual language sizes. 
I put all the pics and sound files from all my languages in one folder and removed the copies. For the files I couldn't identify, I let them remain there (putting an extra number of dots before the extension, so the names were not identical). I am not a computer guy, so it was just a shot in the dark.

That huge folder did NOT work, but I did not want to throw it away (it took some time to create it). 
I made a DISK IMAGE of it, in TOAST.

The funny thing is that when I mount that disk image, it suddenly works!!!!
The screen is filled with a lot of disk icons, and all those languages appear in the Rosetta window.

And they all work!

So if you don't get this torrent working, try to make a disk image of it, and then mount it!

I have no idea of how ""my superfolder"" works in Windows, because I'm a Mac guy.

Good luck!"
,Mashingo,2009-04-21T06:00Z,"...by the way, the original language packs are for BOTH Mac and Windows, and so is the ""engine"" application.

So if you see a Rosetta Window torrent, it should work also for Mac if somebody didn't spoil it.
Many of my Rosetta languages come from such Window torrents, and they all work."
,oena,2009-08-16T01:51Z,"I don't understand what files exactly I'm supposed to save as a disk image. Only the ones that say CHI, ESP, etc?

,princektd,2010-08-16T10:22Z,"problem loading language??? i found that if u have removable drives like card readers, mp3 players, pendrives and stuff, often rosetta stone says it cannot find language CD. so if such devices r there, disable them from device manager. just set up a virtual drive (powerISO or Daemon tools) and mount the lanugage CD. reboot and start rosetta stone. now it will find the language CD and u can install the language."

,dirdp88,2011-08-01T01:23Z,"If anyone else needs some help, running the application on a mac is surprisingly simple.  After installing and using Winebottler, which is free, all you have to do is find the Rosetta Stone windows executable file with Winebottler, I used the autorun file.  Then you ""install"" aka save the program wherever, I guess, you want.  And that's basically it.  You can probably do this for just about any windows program.  I found an example walkthrough on Youtube.  Its super duper uber simple.  Maybe even a caveman can do it, I dunno. :P     "
