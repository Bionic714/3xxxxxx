Complete rip of the futanari-category from futanarizone.com (2005.10.24, before it became a paysite). 

This has been torrented before, but was retorrented due to requests. If you\'ve been downloading the previous torrent and have been unable to finish the downloading, lost some files, something got corrupt etc then you may download this one and point it to the same directory to resume your downloading.

As usual, I WILL be seeding this for at least two weeks. Yes, the tracker can take a while to connect to, yes you may not be able to connect to me right away (the max number of people my client uploads to simultaneously is capped so as not to end up with .001k/sec speeds to 5000 people at the same time) and yes, you may not even see my client as a seed at all (as I often decide to superseed the files, which will result in me not showing up as a seed at all). So don\'t whine about \"SEED FFS!!!!11oneoneeleventyone2211oneone\". It\'s just annoying and it won\'t get you the files any faster. My client won\'t always be online as my client is running on my main gaming rig which I sometimes reboot. If that is the case I will try to have it back up and running as soon as possible. Most of the time this is within 5-10 minutes. Should my computer for some reason crash or overheat while I\'m not home then tough luck, you\'ll have to wait until I\'m home again to fix it. Lastly, my upload speed isn\'t exactly blazingly fast due to the fact that I\'m on dsl, so it\'ll take a while before finished copies appear and more seeds show up. If you connect to this right after I upload the torrent, expect at least a day and a half (most likely two days+) before you or anyone else are done downloading and ready to fap/seed/whine about lack of [name of random doujin].
