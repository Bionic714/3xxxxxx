,treeboi,2006-08-02T07:15Z,Thanx guys for all you positive feedback!. Someone asked me what the 3rd one ment ( this refers to a stage after WGA has been cracked) well the 3rd stage meens when installing updates click 'Custom install' instead of 'Express'

,treeboi,2006-08-03T06:54Z,"ill tell you why its 3.3mb because torrentbox does now allow postings under 2mb so i had to beef it up a bit, and its not self extracting (why would it be) because it was created in VB6 and compiled"

,MrCyan,2006-08-30T15:56Z,Use a DHT torrent client.. Like uTorrent or something...
,ntscuser,2012-03-15T21:20Z,"Worked great with SP2 and earlier. No longer works with SP3 as far as I can tell?

Many security progs flag this as malware so I suggest keeping on a separate disc until needed otherwise it will be deleted."
