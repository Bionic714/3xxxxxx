\"Under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit!\"


NOTE:
This is my second release of this title, and features a new 5.1 audio soundtrack.


RUNNING TIME:  2 hours 27 minutes
LANGUAGE:      English
VIDEO FORMAT:  NTSC / Anamorphic widescreen
AUDIO FORMAT:  Dolby Digital 5.1


With 12 minutes of deleted footage reintegrated into the movie (including more songs from the musical and homages
to the 1968 film) and a 5.1 surround soundtrack, this is even better than seeing The Producers on Broadway!
