Freddy?s Dead: The Final Nightmare 3D


the 6th installment in the series ?Freddy?s Dead: The Final Nightmare? will contain the original 3D ending from the theatrical run. Alternatively viewers can also select the flat 2D version and access the 3D segment isolated through the special features menu on the disc. The 3D segment is a nice gimmick and works on this disc just as well as it did in theaters.
