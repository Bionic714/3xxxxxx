,BanjoHacket,2006-07-28T00:59Z,it can be cracked alright just wait and see! if there is a way to put in a protection its also a way to remove it!
,QueCabro,2006-07-28T02:43Z,is this worth downloading guys?
,Churchills Dog,2006-07-28T02:49Z,"BanjoHacket. No doubt but this is version 4 of Starforce and its been rumored that its far more difficult than the last one which you'll remeber took a year just to crack Chaos Theory. I know its trendy to bash Starforce but you have to admit, they' really have an effective product if it isn't fucking up peoples machines."
,lyttlefear,2006-07-28T06:44Z,more wasted time dont bother it dont work ffs
,kitara,2006-07-28T06:50Z,"this not works ,its only junk"
,KrLi,2006-07-28T16:55Z,if there's ever gonna be a crack.... there's gonna be a crack by deviance or reloaded
,project6,2006-07-28T17:18Z,"Of course there will be a crack for this title... This is what the scene want, a big juicy nut to bite. StarForce can be cracked, there's always twice as many good hackers as good software developers."

Although that may be true, I think everyone deserves a chance to try it out first. Sure there are demos, but they are often way too limited and doesn't give you a chance to see all the features you will be buying. Maybe a demo looks cool, but then the full game is short, lacks features, etc. and wasn't really worth buying.

Anyways, I'll probably wait for the XBox360 version. I prefer playing racing games with a controller, and most PC games doesn't feature analog thumbsticks. :(
If no crack becomes available before then, I might have to satisfy myself with the 360-demo of the game."
,micleg,2006-07-29T22:29Z,"SoundWall: Flatout 2 doesn't support wheels officially (but my Logitech wheel works) and they want you to use pads like the rumble pad (the analogue steering works). I bought the game the same day it was released. I have been looking for a no-dvd crack just to save the DVD from being destroyed by the two-year-old. The original Flatout was cracked, so how come they managed to crack it? Not Starforce protection on that one?"
