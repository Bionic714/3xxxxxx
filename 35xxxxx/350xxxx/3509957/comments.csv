,Ebeeto,2006-08-07T19:17Z,"Trackern är lite lönnig och vill inte visa antalet seeds. Jag seedar (förhoppningsvis) dygnet runt ett tag, så det är bara att leecha...

The tracker is being an idiot and not showing amount of peers. I'll be seeding (hopefully) around the clock for a while, so leech on!"
,Ebeeto,2006-08-07T22:38Z,"Houston, we've got a small problem!

I just noticed that track 2, Sorry Go 'Round is packed in twice. Even though it doesn't render the torrent useless, it kinda makes it look unprofessional. However, I think you'll be just fine, just delete it or rename it to ""Sorry Go 'Round (Reprise)"" and do like Queen... Um... Yeah..."
