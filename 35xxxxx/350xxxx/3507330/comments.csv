daemon cant find this for some reason"
,Joshywuff,2008-02-21T17:25Z,"Oh wow, looks like some of you guys aren't too familiar with .mds...

Well, basically, .MDS is a duplicate of a CD, but different in an .ISO in that you don't need to burn it to a disk or get special software, as long as you have something like Alcohol.  The data is stored on a .MDF file, and you have to right-click and mount the .MDS file to a CD, so that it'll run.  It basically eliminates the need for a crack, CD, and fancy software."
,Randal2,2008-02-22T13:51Z,"hey there

keep seedin'

thanks"
,bkchm91,2008-02-26T21:41Z,"A note to anyone downloading this: If you have Alcohol 120%, DO NOT DOWNLOAD .MDF and .MDS FILES WITH AZUREUS.  Azureus will quit, and refuse to load.

,QoMSoL,2008-04-11T06:03Z,Thanx! The game's far from perfect (I guess cuz it's Microsoft after all) but It's still a great old school hit =D
,Unsweet,2008-04-17T09:36Z,"If you can't convert to .iso or .bin you don't deserve to upload games. 

I hate the windows converters and I refuse to move it to my linux box for one conversion. 

FFS learn."

,THE-REVIEW,2008-08-08T17:26Z,"------------
For everyone that is confused...

To run this game do this:

1. download the file
2. get alcohol 120% (trial works fine)
3. install alcohol
4. go to the  aoe file (mdf/largest)
5. right click on the mdf file
6. select (mount to cd)
7. click the file now and install 
8. that's it!!!

,themixingbowl,2009-09-16T19:16Z,"This is Age Of Empires 1..? Anyway, I extracted it to a folder, then when I run it says i need a CD inserted, and when I run it from the PowerISO it says a graphics error (Direct Draw). Perhaps I need to crack it?"
