This is it! Every hardware driver known to man. Perfect for PC technicians and for anyone that has a habit of losing their driver disks. When "found new hardware wizard" comes up, simply point windows to look in CD ROM. Covers network cards, video cards, mass storage, sound cards, and motherboard chipsets.

Simply unzip file,(will become 1.04gb) and burn folder to a DVD.

For those wondering how every driver can fit into 1gb, it's simple. Instead of putting hundreds of individual drivers in the file, common components are used for each type of driver, with files added that are needed for later versions of a specific type of hardware.

Enjoy and please seed.
