,ATL crew,2006-07-05T18:40Z,can someone seed this please firsttime user of bit torrent so i cant figgure out what to do...im stuck at 99%
,Donnydad,2006-07-06T16:00Z,"Im assuming that you are using the official bitorrent client v4.2.
Ive seen you sitting at 99% for a long time...ive seen others using the same client stuck for a long time too.
I would recommend downloading a different bittorrent client like azureus or bitcomet.
Then move the files that you have already partially downloaded to the download folder of your new client and then restart the torrent in your new client...it should resume from 99% and finish.
Sorry that is the best I can advise you. There are plenty of seeders."
,Donnydad,2006-07-06T16:03Z,At the very least try stopping and starting your current download if you havent tried that already.
