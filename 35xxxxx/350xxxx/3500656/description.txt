I ran Poseideon (Released by ZN) through some filters to brighten it up. 

Ive found that many TC releases are coming out very dark in some areas, almost unwatchable even though the picture quality is very good.

Ive included still and video samples of the changes. So compare for yourself.

Enjoy.
