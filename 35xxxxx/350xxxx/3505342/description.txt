----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Microsoft Corp. has unveiled multiple versions of its upcoming Office business software suite with features that aim to simplify worker collaboration and improve efficiency. Microsoft Office 2007, also known as 2007 Microsoft Office System is Microsoft's next release of its Office system. This version will supersede Microsoft Office 2003. Microsoft Office 2007, which was formerly known as Office "12" in the initial stages of its beta cycle, is to be released in January 2007 for end users and November 2006 for corporate customers (to coincide with the edition launches of Windows Vista), and will feature a comprehensively redesigned graphical user interface, codenamed the "Ribbon". The first beta of Office "12" was released on November 16, 2005, to a limited number of testers. 

The 2007 Microsoft Office, previously code-named Microsoft Office 12, is the successor to its Office business application franchise, which packages together word processing, spreadsheet, presentation and other programs.
Microsoft announces the new Beta 2 of the incoming Office 2007. Preview the 2007 Microsoft Office system and gain first-hand experience with the new look and feel, features, and functionality of the 2007 Microsoft Office release. 2007 Microsoft Office system Beta 2 is a public preview release designed to help you evaluate the Microsoft Office system. The beta is not final and should not be used for business-critical work.

In addition, Office 2007 will run both on Windows Vista and Windows XP. Office 2007 currently looks like under Windows XP vs. Windows Vista. The new UI is a major departure from the past. Many developers are wondering whether this UI should be adopted elsewhere. Microsoft has begun using the orb-like UI (from the Windows Vista Start button) in other applications as well despite there being no mention of it in the Windows Vista UI guidelines. 

The beta release contains all the functionality of the regular release, but is not the final product.
