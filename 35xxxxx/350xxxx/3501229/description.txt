Release Notes:

The debut from this Denver quartet blends piano-based Brit-pop swooning and
scruffy alt-rock melancholia, as if that Keane guy were backed by the
Counting Crows. Achy ballads such as \"Fall Away\" are too long on airbrushed
prettiness, but between the band\'s sculpted guitars and meatier cuts such
as the lead single, \"Over My Head (Cable Car),\" How to Save a Life offers
more elegantly wasted twentysomething angst than the average O.C.
soundtrack.
