Narrated by Tom Brown (45 mins)

Among the magnificent Austrian forest he grew up, wanting to become a forest warden like his father, grandfather, great grandfather and his father, before him. But life was to take Viktor far from the peace & solitude of the great mountains and forests. Instead he was to lead the struggle to preserve the Earth, the forests and rivers; attacking the exploitation of nature, as early as the 1920s. Nature was his teacher - Through an understanding of nature's principles, seen in the flowing motion of water, he gave the world a vision of how technology could be transformed to render free, non-polluting energy for our use. He warned of the consequences, facing humanity, if the present death-oriented technology continued! He died, betrayed by the same powers who promised to make his dreams a reality - commercial gangsters, who TAKE ALL and give NOTHING in return!
