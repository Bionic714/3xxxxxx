,swillynswilly,2006-07-15T07:24Z,hey whats the name of the program for the psp that lets you load 2.5 or 2.6 games with the fastloaders. i had it but i lost my memory card now i'm having a hard time finding it. i think the name of it is Genesis.i think you need it to load some newer games. in case anyone needs to know ive been using hook boots and iso for along time so i know what im doing. thanks for any help
,skafa,2006-07-16T19:46Z,"dont use that 
there is now a DEVHOOK LOADER 0.44
that emulate the 2.71 firmware 
you can load all iso's ever made

,oye01,2006-08-17T15:52Z,i dont know how to do it. :( can someone tell me how. plzzz....
,Digiman,2006-09-02T20:07Z,It's not a good idea ask about complicated stuff at a  Torrent tracker.  Go a PSP site and read one of the guides.  Examples are http://www.pspmod.com/forums/ and maybe http://www.psp-hacks.com/
,borreis,2006-09-12T19:45Z,There is at DevHook noob installer somewhere on TPB. Just search for it. You cant have any higher firmware than 1.50 for DevHook.
,frijolito,2007-04-13T11:10Z,"Just to confirm: THIS WORKS. Tested on firmware 1.5 (downgraded from a TA-082 2.71) and using the provided devhook (lol!).

One warning though: The game sucks. Big time. But it's the first iso I ever got running on my PSP! Whoo!"
,pspnurd,2007-06-21T09:31Z,"Thx, this games seems good... But, the story is like this: I have a 3.40 psp, can i get it downgraded or can i play this game if i update to 3.40 OE/ 3.40 OE-A?? plz! somebody help! "
,pspnurd,2007-07-17T20:59Z,This game is great fun!!
