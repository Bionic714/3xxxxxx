,pilkjaer,2007-03-10T13:41Z,"its downloadable and it's working. size is so big, because of the 230MB of AcrobatReader in 17 different languages. it's a image of original CD, that's why all this shit is here.

so there is nothing to be scared of.

anyone know same Symantec solution but for the Symbian OS 9.1 ???"
,pilkjaer,2007-03-10T13:44Z,"one more thing, if you are paranoid, just make a backup (image) of your current firmware and software. if instalation of Symantec will really crush your system you will be able to restore it from backup."
