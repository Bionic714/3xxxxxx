,isbliss,2006-07-12T04:29Z,Thanks! I'm really looking forward to this.
[V],Zapf,2006-07-13T14:19Z,Me too. Thanks for all the goodies Jade. I'll be seeding.
,q3mi4,2007-04-18T07:37Z,"what soft will I need to convert this into mp3, wav or something playable with my portable mp3 player?"
,Deadend_deadend,2008-02-27T09:14Z,"For those that may not be familiar with the auido format Shorten (.shn), what to do with it and how to convert it to WAV (or MP3 to use on an iPod), you should check out the etree wiki: http://wiki.etree.org. That will give you more information than you ever could possibly need about that form of file sharing. Shorten is fantastic on many levels, as it is a truely lossless format. I have literally hundreds of audio discs archived with this setup. "
,belliottx,2009-01-04T13:52Z,Could you please offer this as Mp3 too? I've tried but I can't seem to open SHN. I've downloaded a program to convert it but I can't get it to work. Since I'm going to convert it anyway why don't just offer it already converted to Mp3?
,ojaideadhead,2009-01-26T06:52Z,Yea...I have 2 or 3 audio converters and none could convert these files...bummer...looked great..
,acousticman,2009-02-13T02:25Z,"Thanks!  For those needing a shn conversion, which in this case will also be harmonic; DB Power Amp works great."
,pesja,2009-05-05T16:06Z,Seed please?
,HDinDSM,2009-11-22T20:21Z,"Unfukingbelievable- THREE Seeders! I'll seed this torrent 100:1 and then some. I'd hate to see it go away & be replaced by some Britney Timberfuck or the BackHole Boys shit.
Thank you Jade Merchant - Much appreciated up."
,janhighboy,2012-01-29T22:28Z,Thanks for this great recording! I converted it to FLAC for anybody having trouble with the SHN files. You can find it here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6995770/Jerry_Garcia__amp_amp__Friends_at_Fulton_House_1969-10-28_
