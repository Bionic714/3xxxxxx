,pc8200,2006-07-03T21:22Z,I installed this application before  I saw the message from Psylocke that there is trojan horse. The sw and crack work well. No trojan affected. I just scanned with Norton AV and Micro Trent and no virusor trojan. Thanks for sharing.
,121Y,2007-01-11T11:47Z,"trojan is ""Win32:Goldun-X[Trj] and was found by my free Avast antivirus. Are there still people arround here that believe that Norton is worth ANYTHING? ;)"
,FotherMucker,2007-01-20T13:33Z,"I don't know what the heck is up with your machines, Psylocke & 121y but I've scanned it with ZoneAlarm security suite on a freshly formatted system which is malware/virusfree and this file runs fine right here! ;)

I say: keep on sharing this beauty cuz it's god damn useful when you are a designer.

,rebekaeve,2008-04-30T02:13Z,"Hi all, just for your information... keygens are often recognized as malware and they are not. It is just the nature of the programming. I have been downloading and cracking software for 15yrs and I have only come across one actually infected file from Pirate Bay, or any other good tracker for that matter. It was easily removed by kaspersky. Figure it out and stop noobing with virus comments.

I uploaded this torrent - and I can assure you that there are no viruses or trojans etc. The only possibility may be that there are other loaded trackers bring in a virus from a hacker who uploaded this torrent to another site!

Figure your @#&$ out."
