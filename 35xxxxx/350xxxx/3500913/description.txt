A little something for the 4th



Ground Environment Pro

Thanks to all the testers & the original poster MyLife

Thanks to UrRight for the fix

Great thanks to B-52H, MyLife, TheFlyingDutchman, FlyGuy, Mrow, Bodger, mdamstel for all the great posts without which the posts here would not be.


Make sure you read the readme for the fix carefully...it mainly applied to a rip & may not be as crucial with the installer.

If your system asks to reboot after install copy the fix before rebooting.

The DownloadMetar.dll needs to be activated in the registry:

Do this:

Click: Start - Run

Type: regsvr32 c:\windows\system32\MetarDownload.dll

Press enter. That'll do it as long as you have the Metardownload.dll
in the system32 folder.

^^^^^thanks to crazyball for that tip.
