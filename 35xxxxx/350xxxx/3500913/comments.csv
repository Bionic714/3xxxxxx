,borough,2006-07-08T07:41Z,ok when i try to use the weather finder a window pops us that says: Metar file cannot be accessed at this time. Any sugestions or I am doing something wrong? rrodger99 thank you bilions:)
,rrodger99,2006-07-08T16:42Z,"borough,

1st thing I would try is to uninstall & then follow the step by step install I posted.

From what the forums have stated...the updates can also take care of some of the Metar issues you describe, so make sure you have it updated.

Make sure your current firewall is not blocking access to the net.

I hope this helps"

Yet, that file is not included in the torrent and is not available on the Internet through the usuall sources. Do yourself a favor. Look in your Windows System32  folder and see if the file is there. If it isn't don't download this torrent!   Thanks a lot rroger99."
,rrodger99,2006-09-27T04:26Z,"ummmm Bob,

The MetarDownload.dll is included in the installer.

I know because I just reinstalled GE Pro after reformatting the drive.

Maybe you didn't register as written in the install instructions."

,Rangerjo,2008-01-06T23:30Z,"Just so you guys dont have to go download the txt tutorial. hope it helps you guys !

Stealthfighter80

A step by step install...I hope this gets you going.

1. Unrar everything into a temp folder of your choice...winrar will make a directory for you.

2. If you have the original Ground enviroment installed...uninstall it before installing GE Pro.

3. Run GE_Pro_Setup.exe & just let the setup run normally. At the end of the setup you might get a prompt that your computer needs to be restarted with a window that says yes or no...choose the option to not restart. I do not remember the exact wording of the dialog.

4. Take the GE_Pro.exe & the ColorfulPB.ocx and copy it to the install directory of GE Pro. If you used the default the path should be

 C:\Program Files\Flight One Software\Ground Environment Professional

Be sure to ok the over write of GE_Pro.exe.

5. Register the DownloadMetar.dll

click Start---Run & copy & paste the following onto the Run box

regsvr32 c:\windows\system32\MetarDownload.dll

hit enter & a window will pop up stating the registration has succeeded.

6. Reboot the computer & you are all done.

You should be able to run Ground Environment Pro."

,mandolf,2010-02-22T23:16Z,"Hey guys, i found a solution for one of the problems, you should test if you have WINDOWS VISTA 64.

Go To:

Commandprompt (swe: kommandotolken)
Run as administrator (swe: kör som administratör)

Write:

regsvr32 C:\WINDOWS\SysWOW64\MetarDownload.dll

And that should do the trick.


As someone mentioned earlier you should write:
regsvr32 C:\WINDOWS\SysWOW\MetarDownload.dll - but he forgot the ""64""."
