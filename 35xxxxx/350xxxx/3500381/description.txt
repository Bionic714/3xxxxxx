This guy is kind of strange but his songs are kind of catchy and his lyrics are cogent. I'd say it's sentimental drinking music (playful and serious at the same time). My friend MSN'd me his album and I can't stop playing it. 
The only thing is I don't know why one songs in .wav and the others in MP3 format..It's not well produced but its not about the makeup, as it is about the face.  Anyways..................
