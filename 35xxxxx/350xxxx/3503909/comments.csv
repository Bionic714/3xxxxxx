,BCcerealkilla,2006-08-04T14:07Z,"NOTE that all format options will format F and G drives. So if you have any apps, games, movies, etc on F or G they will be lost. In the next release I will make it so that formatting F and G is optional. That way you don't lose 100gigs worth of games and stuff on F just to upgrade your softmod. "
