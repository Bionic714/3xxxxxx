Download LimeWire then do a search under 'All Types'.  In the search window type 'Garmin Bluehart'. You will find version 4 with everything you need.  Also all Mapsource unlock codes."
,phreak22,2006-12-31T21:18Z,"This has the full version also, but you need to add a key to the registry (don't try it if you don't know what you're doing in there). Look at the readme.txt for the key you need to add. 

Can't help with GPS unlock codes though, there is a keygen around but it's not available publicly so your best bet is to try to find someone who has it (I don't have it so don't bother asking). "
