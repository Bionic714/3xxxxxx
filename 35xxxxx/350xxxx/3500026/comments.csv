,J.Tramiel,2006-07-05T18:23Z,"It is being seeded u fool!
Its no good whining about it, I have like 60+ people trying to download it from me all at once, of course its going to take a bit of time.
Try a little patience and a bit less whining!
Once a few people start seeding it, the speeds will increase (unless everyone just leeches!)"
