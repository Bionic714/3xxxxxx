This is the second installment of my Amiga Demo DVD trilogy.

It offers some aesthetic improvements on the menus, namely the motion menus.

Again, this image is best burned at speeds of 4x or lower.

Running time = 144 mins.

Hope you enjoy this nostalgic look back at the Amiga Demo scene in its heyday.
