Yes, if mankind suddenly became enlightened and telepathic, anarchy ? the lack of a ruler ? would work just fine. But that?s not how things are, and that we don?t currently have wise and benevolent rulers doesn?t make the concepts of  leadership and organisation invalid. We have over 6 billion people on this planet, and you think they can all be fed and cared for via ""anarchy""? Good luck to you."
