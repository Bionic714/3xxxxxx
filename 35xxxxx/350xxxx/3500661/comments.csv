""GS WARNING: need at least 2 simultaneous render targets. some zbuffer effects will look bad."" 
""Need seperate alpha blending! some effects will look bad.""
""Need independent write masks! some z buffer effects might look bad""
""Need MRT post pixel Shader Blending for some effects""

,dbrizzy,2007-08-24T04:26Z,"fuck you. I'm intelligent and I think if you understand what someone elses problem is FUCKING HELP THEM instead of telling them how ""dumb"" or ""imbecilic"" they are. Be productive it's good for your colon plus smart people don't think it's funny. Sorry I don't use the ps2 emu if I did tho people I'd tell you how to use it. Most likely you run the emu (the emulation program that lets you play the ps2 game) and in the file menu or options menu you choose to open a rom (the game itself) the rest you should be able to get through I hope. Stop being dicks people. Help somebody."

PS2 emulation requires a high-end gaming computer, so it sounds like your system can't meet the massive requirements of it yet."

,durinsvloek,2007-09-29T13:24Z,"ok people..

if you got the error of not finding Bios and plugins,
do the following:

go to Config->Configuration,
click ""Set Plugin Directory"" and browse to the directory Plugins in the installation directory,
do the same for ""Set Bios Directory""...

this should work..."

,sweet_hannah888,2007-12-10T22:31Z,what is the minimal system requirement for PS2 emulator?
,VeganFreak,2008-02-09T23:15Z,"PCSX2 0.9.4
Minimal Specs:
AMD XP/64 or Intel Pentium 4 (VM Built will not work with non SSE2 CPU's)
512MB of RAM
Pixel Shader 1.4 supporting card (GSdx Graphics Plugin Only)

Recommended Specs: (For reasonable performance in many games, but not all)
AMD64 X2 or Intel Conroe E6600+ (Multi Threading is supported in PCSX2)
512-1024MB of RAM (more RAM allows for VM mode to be stable)
Pixel Shader 2.0 supporting card (recommended GeForce 6600-8800 or equivalent ATi card)

Possible Ideal Specs:
64bit OS such as Vista or winXP64, to allow for future support of 64bit recompilers.
Future AMD or Intel Quad Core maybe needed, but currently the support of 4 threads is not handled by PCSX2, and the effect of threading out EE / VU is not yet known.
We don't forsee you requiring a GPU more powerful than the current generation of cards, up to and including the nVidia GeForce 8800."

,khhero1,2011-05-07T06:34Z,"o if i get this will the bios wok with the 
0.9.8 one right"
,ust2,2011-09-08T07:33Z," Able to get PCSX2 running with the US bios with no problems.

 1. You'll need these bios files extracted to a seperate folder before installing PCSX2. 
 2. During installation it will ask for a bios. Select the folder you extracted them all to, and 3 selections will come up.
 3. Select a bios for the game(s) you are trying to play, if it is originally a US NTSC then naturally you'll need the US bios.

  I  downloaded and used the latest PCSX2 0.9.8 from the official site too.

 Even able to use my PS3 controller :D With a charge cord you can use a program called DS3Tools for this and any controller enabled games (other emu/roms like NES/SNES/PSX work with it too).

 The only issue i'm having is with a bit of screen shake. For some reason it's jumping up and down slightly, as if watching something recorded by someone with a shaky hand lol."
,ust2,2011-09-08T07:37Z," Forgot to say thanks and +1!

 Under GS plugin configuration, there's an interlacing option, setting it to 'Blend bff (slight blur)' fixed it."
