,monstert,2006-07-18T16:05Z,Cheers bud :D Just what i needed as well. Thanks again
,mickflip,2006-07-18T18:15Z,"I know how to install it, but FSUIPC isn't registerd (I've placed the reg key into modules map), and WideFS isn't registerd? How to reg them?"
,Bob_T,2006-07-18T20:11Z,"Installed it, copyed the key and it didn't work. Tried registering it, and the key in the key file isn't a vaild key.

Hopefully someone else can get this working.

Thanks for the upload. I've been wanting this for awhile now."
,4X-AXG,2006-07-18T22:24Z,"usually the 'Dorival' data does work to register FSUIPC, but when 3rd party add-ons such as Active Sky try to access FSUIPC it doesn't work..

I haven't tried installing this one though, maybe instead of replacing the key file, entering the data manually works to register FSUIPC. but again, I don't think any other software will be able to communicate with it"
,fabula,2006-07-19T02:21Z,"Recently I was pressed into instaling this version over my old pirated FSUPC 3.52 - and it worked AFAIK, so try DLing older one and just write over it new FSUIPC.dll"
,colimodio,2006-07-19T23:14Z,Can u crack the newer FSD versions? They are easy to download but they are locked.
,alosh747,2006-09-10T00:32Z,"hi,i downloaded it,but i couldn't find key or key generator? what should i do?"
,leonsies,2008-01-04T20:21Z,This one doesnt work if u wanna use`it in a private network. And thats the main idea with this addon. Soo...the best thing to do is too pay for it. Bye the way...I`m looking for Active Camera for FS20004...anyone?
,MrSpeaker,2008-01-13T23:30Z,Need a REG KEY for WideFS already have FSUIPC. Anyone kind enough to share this yet. I can't believe these idiots expect us to pay 50 bucks for this product no wonder business is good on torrent sites. Idiots
,SAYAH,2008-06-25T15:42Z,I tried the WiderFS module and it deleted and crashed the add-in and all of FS2004.  Beware activating this module!!!!!!!!!
,pizza25,2009-06-01T04:23Z,hm don't get any download. anybody knows why? should work fine
,N519AB,2010-01-17T16:22Z,"@ Mr.Speaker:

You dumb ass piece of shit.... who the fuck do you think you are?  ""I wanna be able to download anything I want for free, fuck them and their money"".  Some of us just try shit out and THEN buy it.  Its because of little faggots like you that make them have to charge so much these days.
And BTW, WideFS is worth every fucking penny.... unless you're just some fuckin couch jockey with no real skill.  

Fuck You!"
