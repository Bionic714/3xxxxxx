,OatcakeBuSter,2008-11-13T04:11Z,"This tool works however it only removes the wga as its suppose to BUT windows tries to redownload the update wga update again after. Best to set your updates on ""notify me but dont automatically install them"" then you can actually choose to install the files you wish. If you do redownload the wga by accident agin, simply run this tool and it will remove the microsoft wga again and so on and so on. very Handy tool but hasnt actually cracked it as such like the service pack patches.
Good work though dude, nice up!"
