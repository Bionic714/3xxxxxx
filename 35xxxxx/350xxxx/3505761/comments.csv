,slagfish,2007-12-31T20:07Z,"This is a prick of a thing to open. What the hell is TPB anyway!
You will need to change the file extension from .TPB to .rar then something weird happens then it all seems to come good.
So far it is working for me"

,RayUltimate,2008-05-20T04:50Z,"download went great.  but after installation and running, the program tries to load a virtual fretboard and then just stops responding.  Thing is, I cant just close it with task manager.  I have to completely restart my computer.  thanks for the upload and great d/l speed, but it's not working for me >_"
,wonderwink,2008-07-02T01:21Z,"Would anyone be willing to walk me through how to properly get this program to work from start to finish.  THis is my first torrent that requires the use of winarar, how do i burn or mount it?  THanks in advance for your help!"
,Bleiz,2008-10-13T22:13Z,Doesnt work on vista 64 !!! This pisses me off i really wanted that software :(
,CaptainBeefheart314,2008-11-22T09:17Z,"Have seeded up to 5:1 ratio, so stopped it just now. Great program, this... already up to A7-chord after 2 evenings, so much easier than learning from an instruction book. Recommended to all, especially those who are just getting started!

Tip for the Vista guy: run a virtual machine with XP on it inside Vista, use Guitar Method inside the virtual area ;-) that ought to do the trick - although I say you're dead wrong in using Vista - XP was bad enough, but Vista stretches the MicroSoft infamy to a whole new level of excrement...

For the real newb question on how to run an ISO: well, you download ""Daemon Tools"" (free version or the Pro, which is completer but not really necessary), ask the program to create a ""virtual drive"" and then open the ISO file inside that virtual drive... it's simpler than it seems! Or you could just burn the ISO using Nero/ISOBuster/one of the hundred others out there ;-)

Good luck to all!"

I wanna know if this is the eMedia Guitar Method 1 , then can you upload the eMedia Guitar Method 2 (v.2). I am not sure if there is a Method 2 program. Can anybody tell me that? I will appreciate the help. "

eMedia Guitar Method 2 is now called eMedia Intermediate Guitar Method. There is a torrent for that here I think. :)"
