Guitar Method is by many regarded the no. 1 guitar learning software. (Read review at http://guitar-lesson-software-review.toptenreviews.com/guitar-method-review.html)

The latest version I where able to find out there in the world of torrents where v.1.5 (I think), so I went to the closest music store and bought this one (v.2), just so i could share it with all you wannabe rockstars out there.

It includes several new features such as new lessons, including more information on guitar set-up, information on amplifying electric guitars, chord progression basics and additional blues songs and an improved interface.

1. Unpack using winrar.

2. Burn or mount using daemon tools.

3. Install

4. Enjoy!


If someone have Guitar Method Intermediate (not Guitar Method 2), please put it upp on TPB!


(Btw, this is my very first torrent so all feedback is welcome)
