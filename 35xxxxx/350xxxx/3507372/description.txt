-flicker from the difference between film and video frame rate
-Sorry for the out of focus and the large size and the flicker. The focus is
actually good except at the very beginning and it is quite watchable.
-if you can do it better then reencode it. or go into a theatre with a cam.
-made using KINO MPEG2 internal de-interlace stereo 48khz
