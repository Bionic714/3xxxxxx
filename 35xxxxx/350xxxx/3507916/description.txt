TexasCalulatem (TC Setup) is a separate and independent program that was 
created to give it's users a significant advantage over other online 
poker players.  The program basically allows you to "cheat" by
rooting itself in with the live poker table server and mathematically
calculating the odds of what other people might have according
to how they are playing and what cards are in the flop, etc.
The card reading is fully automatic so all you have to do is sit
ack and relax while the program tells you what your next move should be. 

The serial number is:

Name: ORiON 2004
S/N: 750X-F45P-GEML-953T


The program works best when it can automatically read your cards.
It can only do this on Party Poker, plus a few others like Pokerstars and PAcific Poker.
