Should I use the European patch, I can use wormnet just fine, but I get lumped up with people speaking a language I don't understand. I really mean no offense, but I would really like to play the game in a language I can understand."
,hustler142,2008-04-17T13:51Z,why i cant play using LAN?
,pvt.punch,2008-04-17T17:46Z,"this is a poor torrent. a monkey could have put this together.

1. there is no ""no cd"" crack included. true, you can head to gamecopyworld and download one, but it's pretty standard to include one with the torrent ya know?
2. this does not perform well on high end computers, and no explanation is given? i got this to work on the minimum 600x800 resolution, but when i crank it to 1024x768 (the highest it offered me), in-game it doesn't display properly (sounds there but no visual). the menus were also taking very long to get through. i've played this game before on another computer so i know what it's supposed to be like, and this ain't it!

i'm going to try a different torrent off piratebay for this game, and i'd suggest all newcomers reading this do the same."
,pvt.punch,2008-04-17T18:52Z,"i tried this one and it's much better:

ctrl+alt+delete
aktivitetshanteraren

avsluta process explorer.exe
starta sedan spelet genom att välja arkiv - ny aktivitet (kör...)

Jag har även inställt på att köra spelet i kompatibilitetsläge för win98/win me och ikryssat att köra det som admin.
Dessa ändringar vet jag inte om man behöver göra.

I vilket fall så funkar det felfritt för mig. Det blir aldrig något fel med färgerna eller så"

,LebanonK,2010-02-11T13:12Z,"For all your newbs out there trying to make this work on Windows 7. (Made this work on Windows 7 Ultimate 32bit)

(N.B. This game will never work on any Intel Integrated Graphics Accelerator no matter how hard you try. Intel has to release the drivers for the cards and that will never happen)

Instructions:
1) Mount Image & Install. Here is a great program to do that. ( http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads )
2) Download the update: worms world party_EUsp1_UK and install ( you can find a link to it somehwere in these comments )
3) Download the Windows 7 fix: wwp_vista_win7_fix_v1.4 ( http://forum.team17.com/showthread.php?s=219f0e53f6dbed3cb0d55e32763a9ec8&t=38883 ) you need to register by the way to download 
4) Make sure you have the File still mounted to play the game.
5) If you want you can download the the CD crack from gamecopyworld.com but be sure to right click it and go into properties>compatibility then go down to settings and check everything. In the game options be sure to only have the resolution at 640 x 480 or else you will get inverted colors.

Hope that helps all you newbs out there trying to figure out how to play this great classic. ENJOY!!!"
