What do you guys think -- should I delete this torrent and start seeding it all over again?"
,wmgan,2006-07-26T04:06Z,"Okay, I made a small patcher to fix the problem (for Windows only), you can download it at http://www.filefactory.com/file/da426a/ . (Though I suspect most of you won't care about one incorrectly linked chapter button.)"
