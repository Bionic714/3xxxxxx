,Jackass Jimm,2006-08-12T18:40Z,"I'm always seeding, as long as there isn't a blackout here or I don't have the complete file.  So far, this is stuck at 47 %.

I ask that anyone that does finish the downloads PLEASE stay seeding.  All the other torrents (Disks 2 - 6) have no seeders, sans for me, always because people download them and then leave the torrent.  I am not one to seed stuff (I seed to .50...and I stop after I download my file) but these files are pretty ok and we should encourage their distribution.  

So, if DavetheNave ever decides to finish seeding this, then please stay seeding for others."
,Jackass Jimm,2006-09-17T00:47Z,"Ok, seems davethenave has abandoned us all...tried....its already been like a month and a half with this torrent at the beginning..."

As of Feb 7 2007


I see 83-131-94-74 has 48% of this file


I'm doing my part to fill in missing parts. Then I'll upload the rest of the 25 set mp4 files.


Help me.


After you get a complete file leave it on for share."

This video course is much better than the Live class offered by TEFLINTERNATIONAL.

Thanks to Dave Hopkins for lending the DVD's.

Without his help this posting of the course would not be possible."

Same as above - sent through GSpace in files approx 9meg, split using GSplit, with an *.exe that will recompile them when all finished dowloading.

As suggested to me by davethenave, I've set up some accounts just to keep these files in, then I can easily send them to others, or download them to any computer with Internet access! Works for me!! (you'll need 3 accounts if this is what you want to do, too!!)

If you are using Utorrent as your file share, highlight each file, double click then paste the above trackers.

The video course torrent files were created more than a year ago. It only has one tracker for pirate bay and is no longer recommended. Add all of the above trackers will make a big difference for connected peers and download speed.

,daveshelper,2008-01-06T03:39Z,"Thank you:

All who  seed this series of 25 disk. It's a long list and large files.

I'm asking your help. 

Please... After you complete a download Leave it to seed until a couple more people can take your place.

I've tried off and on for more than a year to make this teaching course available.

This is my last run. 

I'll be off the net in a couple of weeks. 

It's up to you whether these torrents live or die."
