This is just a collection (a bad one) of genuine celtic songs performed by real celtic music artists. I could make a thousand of such ""albums"" way much better than this one. If you want to listen a good celtic music collection, choose the real deal, the ones made by the pros, like Shanachie, Green Linnet, Narada, Putumayo or other Record Companies."
