Great book first of all, a must have for any aspiring game developer.

next of, i want to know if this is the 1st edition of the book or the second edition, if it is the first, anyone know where i might find the 2nd ed.? and also the follow up for this one: ""Advanced 3D Game Programming All in One"" along with the cd-rom? I've been able to get a copy but it doesn't hold the cd-rom with it, which is a damn shame...

anyhow, hope to hear some replies :)

Happy Downloading"

I've been kinda wondering to start learning programming and game design for a long time. But not knowing where to start. This will be my starting point, for wich I know will be a long journey.

Thnx for the opportunity to be able to read this book :) "
