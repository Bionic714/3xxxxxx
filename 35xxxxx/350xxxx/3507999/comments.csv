,Temptation,2006-07-29T00:19Z,interesting.. I remember seeing these Elric books in the library and remember being very captivated and intrigued by the sight of the pale alibino anti-hero staring at me from the book covers.. always wanted to check the books out but never got around it.. I guess I'll do so now.. thanks.
