,supermegeme,2007-11-22T22:48Z,"try friendblaster pro 8.3 altought not up-to-date,
but this allows u have to have mutiple accounts on myspace. gettin any other updates will cause u to pay $39:95 for another account"
,TampaBayDJ,2008-12-06T09:30Z,"Wow... really shitty program, not worth your 10 minutes of time.

The window doesn't even expand to more than a couple inches.. and it keeps telling you to log in, even when you've already done so, over and over.

I've used alot of myspace bots, and this is the worst. Free, but free for no reason because it doesn't work. If you don't believe me try it yourself.. "
