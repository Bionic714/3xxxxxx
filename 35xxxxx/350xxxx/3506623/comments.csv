,w000ter,2009-06-11T13:57Z,"when you fire the equivalent of over 200,000 rockets landing on us towns and cities when scaled up to the us population yes, its self defense. this documentary is biased as hell because it doesn't acknowledge that these people suffer because they support continued war through terrorism. it is the dog that tries to gain your sympathy by crying after its mauled someone. it is sad to watch, but it is disingenuous to omit the previous incident that caused its suffering.  its ""less sensational"" than much anti israeli propaganda, but it uses the same tactics to distort reality by viewing things through a rather narrow reality."
