Presenting Walt Disney Fables.... a series of unforgettable tales told through captivating music, brilliant animation and colourful characters - Disney storytelling at it`s best. 
Six classic fairy tale legends make this Disney collection sheer joy. The timeless tale of The Tortoise And The Hare features Max Hare and Toby Tortoise in the proverbial race against time. 
In the Pied Piper, rats have overrun Hamelin, and the melodies of one talented piper provide an amazing adventure. Next, in a comically brilliant fable, King Midas gets The Golden Touch, learning a big lesson. It`s a rematch in the ring when Max Hare and our slow-moving hero box in Toby Tortoise Returns - a delightfully funny contest where Toby really comes out of his shell. 
Visit two merry old souls in Old King Cole and King Neptune. Every storybook friend is invited to King Cole`s castle for an evening of mirth and music. And watch as King Neptune saves his seagoing subjects from a ship full of plundering pirates.
