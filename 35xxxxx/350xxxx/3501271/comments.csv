,c69,2006-07-09T20:29Z,seed händer inget

,sleepyman2,2006-07-10T22:56Z,"We have being stocked at 28% for some days now, please, plesae."
,c69,2006-07-11T07:26Z,seed
,jason666,2006-07-11T10:35Z,"Yeah seedeing would be nice, also stuck in 28%"
,Rawern,2006-07-11T12:51Z,trhen there must be something wrong. cause i uploadet it 2 times. or maby some people just want to upload and then not seed for a while. seems to be very usual here on tpb.
,sleepyman2,2006-07-11T14:29Z,"Nobody on the trackers have more than 28%, Please, please Rawern"
,icleolion,2006-07-11T20:41Z,try superseeding/initial seeding rawern.  Get utorrent from www.utorrent.com (only utorrent and mainline have working superseeding/initial seeding).  If u got a crappy upload there it would be foolish of u to try to upload a torrent this big without using superseeding/initial seeding.
[V],sia,2006-07-18T16:32Z,"Den här verkar steeeeeeeeeendöööööd 28,2 %"
,SysGhost,2006-08-07T01:06Z,"Seems this torrent has become invalid, since I tried open this *.torrent file on several different computers, and all get's a broken or invalid/corrupt torrent-file which cant be opened"
,elasticmonkey,2006-10-03T18:21Z,"Come on mate load seed this movie out again im bored of seeing 28.3%. I for one will keep my torrent open for days after i have got a complete copy. there was about 20 off us all stuck on 28.3% last nite, come on Rawern do us all a favour. "
,CuriousShade,2006-12-04T18:07Z,Please seed this guys. There's another OFJ torrent elsewhere that is similarly not being seeded. Let's get this thing moving.
,Vitek/88,2007-07-09T15:07Z,"I'm not even THINKING bout DL-ing this one, reading the comments. Hey Rawern, why don't you make it all easy for us, I mean why did you make this torrent in the first place?"
,terminate1,2010-03-29T18:12Z,Seed Please!
