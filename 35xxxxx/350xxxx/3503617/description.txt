Under the watchful eye of his mentor Chief Mike Kennedy (Travolta),
probationary firefighter Jack Morrison (Phoenix) matures into a
seasoned veteran at a Baltimore fire station. Jack has reached
a crossroads, however, as the sacrifices he's made have put him in
harm's way innumerable times and significantly impacted his
relationship with his wife and kids. Responding to the worst blaze
in his career, he becomes trapped inside a 20-story building. And
as he reflects on his life, Chief Kennedy frantically coordinates
the effort to save him.
