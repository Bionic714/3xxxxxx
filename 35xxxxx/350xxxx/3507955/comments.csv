,greatwiz666,2009-05-14T21:30Z,"To you noobs out there:
In the wonderful world of movie files, there is something that you will require to get to watch the shit. CODECS.

Now, what is codecs? Well, don't ask me. All I know, is that you need them to get your player to play the movie at all.

Now, I should say something really smart; GET VLC!!! (Don't ask. Google it, for christ's sake..)"
