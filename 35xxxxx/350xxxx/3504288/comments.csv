,poon!!,2006-07-18T13:28Z,Is it necessary to update to 10.4.6 before installing this update?
,denlion,2006-07-18T15:50Z,"Yeh, I think so but I can't find the 10.4.6 intel update. Where can we find it?"
,poon!!,2006-07-18T18:06Z,"I downloaded 10.4.6 just before they shutdown piratebay, I will try to upload it again if I can find it. But I haven't tested 10.4.6 yet. Guess I have to do that before 10.4.7."
,duranged,2006-07-20T01:26Z,I have no idea if you can use this to upgrade from a version older than 10.4.6 but just to be safe I wouldnt try. :-)
,finebf20,2006-08-05T08:33Z,will this version work for amd processors.  i tried doing software update and it crashed the install.
,ronemp1,2006-08-07T08:23Z,"I tried it and it don't work, hangs on boot screen, unable to find boot disk. So I went back to 10.4.6
