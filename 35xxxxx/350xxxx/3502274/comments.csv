,CamTron118,2010-01-20T08:33Z,This movie fucking sucks.
,mugwort,2011-11-06T18:28Z,"So who pasted these unrelated subtitles on the movie, and how do we find a copy without them?
Sheesh."
,mugwort,2011-11-08T17:48Z,"Fortunately, the unrelated (white, not yellow) subtitles are in the separate .srt file; you can set your player to disregard this subtitle track. 

These are not Sun Ra's, but somebody else's writings."
,Klatu666,2012-07-15T04:13Z,"@CamTron118
Then we can pile you on the big mass of people who didnt get it. That was the problem with u and those who didnÂ´t get Sun-Ra. You might think its Jive talk.. is actually about liberation. Get real... or dont."
