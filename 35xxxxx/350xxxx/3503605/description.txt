This is a Pirate theme for gaim!

Installation instructions:
Untar the downloaded .tar to

/usr/share/pixmaps/gaim/smileys

(you will problobly have to use sudo)
And choose the Pirate theme in Tools => Preference => Smiley Themes

This theme consists of a few pictures (the emoticons) and a theme-file (where you can see what commands that gives a sertain icon). I don't know how the themes in MSN-messenger works, but you should be able to at least add these emoticons manually.

Have fun.
