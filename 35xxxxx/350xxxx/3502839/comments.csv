,Fr3dr1kg,2006-11-09T00:52Z,"The sound flows great, but the image keeps stopping and lagging throughout the film.. any tips?"
,maritin,2006-12-07T17:24Z,"The sound is ok but it dosn't find a codec who works.
sorry abot my english"
,shaheens,2006-12-08T02:53Z,"same problem. no image, only sound. how to render?"
,Junx,2006-12-14T06:21Z,"You can use VLC (videolan.org/vlc/) to play it, but FMP4 is fully standards-compliant MPEG-4 ASP video.  Should play with a DivX 5 or 6 codec in theory (I haven't tested it since I use VLC anyways)."
,CasinoRoyale,2006-12-14T08:15Z,The film keeps stopping and lagging for me also.
,Troy90,2006-12-18T23:04Z,"""Junx"", Im using the VLC aswell but there aren't image at all, only sound. But the movie works with windows media, though it does lagg as mentioned above. You've got any idea how to fix my issue?"
,Troy90,2006-12-18T23:24Z,"Aiight downloaded something called ""AVI FourCC"" and used it to change the codec (FMP4) into DivX (in fact DX50) and now i finally get an image using VLC  media player. But the lagg still exists, its a pity with such a great movie."
,ang3l2006,2007-01-05T14:05Z,I have no sound or pirture? i use bs player 2.0 i have ace mega codec pack installed and i don't know what to do?
,ang3l2006,2007-01-05T14:18Z,"Okay now i got VLC media player. I can play the file with audio and picture but it is stopping and lagging like some of they other's what can i do about that?

And i'm sorry for my english i dont  spell that well but i'm trying"
,Sjuns,2007-01-06T23:58Z,"This rip lag while playing with VLC i don't know with other media players but don't download if you use VLC... This is some junk imo, might be bad encoding..."
,txm009,2007-04-02T06:00Z,seed!!!!!
,Junx,2008-03-18T15:36Z,"I hate to reply to a comment from over a year ago, but VLC and MPC are both based on the same audio/video libraries (FFmpeg).  Even MPlayer and xine both use FFmpeg extensively.  FFmpeg is the shiznit, however."
,mike0276,2008-03-20T01:43Z,how can i seed?
