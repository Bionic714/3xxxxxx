From Wikipedia (GFDL): "American Pie Presents Band Camp is a 2005 direct-to-video sequel (of sorts) to the American Pie trilogy of films. It was directed by Steve Rash and written by Brad Riddell, and centers on Matt Stifler (played by Eli Marienthal in the original film), younger brother of Steve Stifler (who was played in the trilogy by Seann William Scott). In this film, Matt (Tad Hilgenbrink) is sent to the infamous band camp, where he meets a young woman and is compelled to change his ways."
