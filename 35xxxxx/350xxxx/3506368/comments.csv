,fria_fosterlandet,2006-07-28T20:43Z,anyone got a solution for the briefing shit?
,Panodilo,2006-07-29T15:39Z,What briefing shit? When does this happen? Do you mean the brief lecture in the airport manager's office in the beginning of gameplay? 
,Panodilo,2006-07-29T15:46Z,"I suck at these games but for some reason I've managed to build a profitable airline in good standing in little time, and with three ship-shape 767s, A320, 737 fitted with nice interiors and no debt, no cheats."
,Panodilo,2006-07-29T15:54Z,"In-game instructions are scarce, I've noticed. I recommend you consult the following link for help on gameplay.

,teamster,2008-01-20T21:54Z,"Great game, very addicting! Been a while since i played it now, and I was hoping for the Evolution og Deluxe edition. Anyone got it?:)"
,killinj,2008-10-28T19:56Z,"The ""briefing"" fix is easy. Just double click on the setup.bat file in the folder and follow the instructions. It will decompress the voice files as well as the others. You will then have the briefing as well as having the people talk."
