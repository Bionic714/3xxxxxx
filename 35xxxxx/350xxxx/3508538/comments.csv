,githead,2006-10-02T13:23Z,"Patience, my piratey chums...here is the solution to your problems:
1. install game - DO NOT install stuff in Hoodlum directory.
2. get 1.1 official patch (check correct region - EU one worked for me) and install.
3. go to gamecopyworld.com and get file vtl-cru1.rar; apply as directed.
4. play the game!!"

,Eimell,2007-07-03T09:33Z,zatsja: vad en bra dator är tycker jag är ganska relativt. men annars så tycker jag att du ska försköka att uppdatera dina grafikdrivrutiner och om det inte fungerar så ställ ner grafikläget i spelet. 
,didaaf,2007-07-05T01:19Z,"Daaamn i can't install this game, i've got the bloody CRCCHECKFAIL. My system must be fast enough  (c2d,2gig,1950XT) and now problems with any other games.

,didaaf,2007-07-05T17:52Z,"Ok, i downloaded a other one from usenet this time (also hoodlum) witch i didn't get to work at the first time to. But this time when i mounted it, it unmounted itself after a couple of seconds so it must be securom or something.  I couldn't find any traces of securom tough, but it must be some kind of a security problem (maybe some traces from a other game i'll don't know). Anyways, this time when i uninstalled daemon and burned the game i could install it, i copied the system files (so i didn't use the patch and vtl-cru1.rar) and it worked just fine so yippie kaa yee mother fuckers, i'm roling. Asskicking game :D

@Reidarm, did you even try to do something!? If you did you probably figured out for yourself that you could mount .nrg (nero). Maybe you have more luck with this version then i had, good luck!!!"
,shadowbane07,2007-08-28T14:23Z,yea  i got the same ?
,darkmajinleo,2007-08-29T23:33Z,"For all the peeps whose having trouble with MCCDyn.dll not found cuz of HOODLUMS cracks. This is a solution to your problem. So pay attention!

(always make a backup copy of the original before overwriting)

At the System folder of Riddick. Copy the Hoodlums cracks which are ""SbzEngine.exe"".
Notice which folder you took it from and paste it in the designated folder. 

~For example : Win32_x86_SSE2 from Hoodlum to the Win32_x86_SSE2 from the original (not the backup)~

And your good to go. I have XP with Service pack 2 = (Win32_x86_SSE2) which for me it works and I'm guessing it should work with every other version. So good luck and good game."

But....gameplay is SUPER jittery. Almost like it's jumping in frame rate all crazy. I'll get fluid action for a minute or two sometimes but then it just goes nutso again.

Is this a graphics card thing or what? Dated game on a newer machine? 

Running a 8600....which isn't great but should be good enough, right?"

,adventurjunky,2009-04-25T15:16Z,"Ok this dident make sence so I was like wtf man why you given me this rediculous error niga?As soon as I cranked up my cpu fan the game worked, turns out because I was lazy and did not clean my pc for 6 months my graphic card was overheating,I dismantled my cpu heat sink and graphics took them along with my tower down into the garage turned up the air compressor to 90 PSI and you should of seen the dust storm that came out,gave the heat sin a new lick of thermal paste and I was ready to go.
So there is a lesson for you kiddies keep your PC`S clean!!!!!!"

,Anarith,2009-05-11T00:27Z,"it does work, with the patch and crack.
but i got a weird problem, i played the first tutorial like level and now im in the prison, when someone talks i hear it just fine but if i move toward the talking person his voice level changes to a high frequency so it sounds very fishy, if i walk away from him the voice level changes to a lower frequency, any solutions?"
,truthy,2009-06-08T19:06Z,"okay got it working, mounting the image with magic disc doesn't work properly ... I used Deamon Tools Lite instead
installed - patched to v1.1 (Gamershell) & used the crack from GCW

thx for sharing!"

I have not tried it yet but judging by the comments it looks good."

I had the same problem. all you need to do is convert the .nrg with MagicISO to a .iso file.
hope this helps

,bramill,2010-02-08T12:55Z,"Thankyou very much! =)

works perfectly if you use this crack

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4289444/Chronicles_of_Riddick__escape_from_butcher_bay_Patch_and_Crack

and follow the instructions below

1) if you installed the game and applied the ""hoodlum"" patch, you need to unstinall and reinstall
2) after you've reinstalled,  you need to apply the patch. the U.S. patch doesn't work, you need to EU patch to get this to work(included in the torrent)
after you've apllied the patch, copy the ""system"" content in the vitality_crack folder into the chronicles of riddicks install directory:

(""C:\Program Files\Starbreeze Studios\Riddick EFBB\"")

if you get a warning saying ""system folder already exists"" click the ""yes to all"" button"

,The_Abbott_77,2010-06-15T04:25Z,"For those with a hanging splash screen with Win 7 Ultimate: 1. install game 2. install the patch(make sure it's the eu one not the original patch) 3. load the vitality crack (not hoodlum). It will work. I know I'm repeating what others said but to make it clear it's hoodlums patch that makes it hang, not the video driver"
,cfh0384,2010-07-10T09:32Z,Please someone HELP! I\'ve installed this game with the patch linked here numerous time precisely to the instuctions.

,termite43,2010-10-10T05:31Z,"I FINALLY got this to work on Win 7 x64.  After patching & cracking, when I would try to start the game my 1080p TV would instantly get set to 480p SD and the screen would go black - nothing.  I tried the nVidia OpenGL fix - nothing.  Here's how I did it.  Do a full install.  Make a copy of the 'System' folder and keep it.  Copy and paste the v1.0 Hoodlum crack.  Run the game (it opened into a window on my desktop).  Change the resolution to something your monitor can display and choose full screen display.  Exit the game.  Replace cracked 'System' folder with your original.  Patch to 1.1.  Copy & paste v1.1 Vitality crack.  Done."

1. Download game
2. Download EU patch(23 mb), which can be easily found on net on sites like brothersoft and gamespot, and patch the game
3. download the vitality crack(google it ,it is available on gamecopyworld.com)
copy system folder from vitality crack (NOT HOODLUKM crack) and paste it in install dir.
4. play game"

Awesome game!"
,albertalen,2012-04-25T08:55Z,"thanks for the games, it really works (with the crack i got from other torrent),

but my question is, how to save the game??,

(the save game profile is always gone when i start the game)"
,kebek,2012-07-15T14:20Z,Same problem. Profile gets corrupted after you exit the game and you can only delete it and make a new one.
