The Chronicles of Riddick isn't a highly anticipated first-person shooter sequel, but don't let that make you assume it can't be one of the year's best action games--because it is.
The Good: Incredible blend of first-person shooting, stealth, and exploration; excellent story, dialogue, and characters; breathtaking visuals and audio; exquisite pacing--never a dull moment; great pc-exclusive content--new gameplay sequence and dvd-style commentary.
The Bad: On the short side--only about 10 hours long; a few graphical and ai quirks; you might expect multiplayer, but there is none.
