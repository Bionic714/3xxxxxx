The Creation

Net Tools ┬⌐ 2006 Mohammad Ahmadi Bidakhvidi was born in 2002, while the idea behind the project was to create and provide one immense tool with all the main network tools included in it. A lot of sniffing and scanning network tools were present, but also other multipurpose tools that could be used by system administrators. In this way certain procedures could be done easier and faster by various network users. Net Tools has always experienced good attention, and that was and is one of the main reasons it still exists! The first version was totally written and compiled in Visual Basic 6. The further versions became more advanced and used also other computer languages and other compilers. Because of the immense flexibility, Net Tools had a lot of success. The latest version of the project is Net Tools 4.5. This version has become hybrid. It means it works together with applications that are made and designed for Net Tools, this to obtain more flexibility and user-friendliness. There are quite a lot of constructive and valuable applications included in Net Tools. The latest versions of Net Tools are also being developed in Visual Studio .NET, so for the most hybrid applications the dotnet framework is required. Therefore Net Tools is being published with an installer with the framework included and one without. So the users having the framework already don?t have to download the framework again. Net Tools 4.5 is mainly being tested on Windows XP and other Microsoft Windows NT systems (Windows NT, Windows 2000, etc). It is actually designed for Windows XP, but it remains compatible with all the Microsoft Windows Operation Systems. With his 140+ tools it is a great variety of useful tools for network users. The size of Net Tools 4.5 is 23.1Mb. With .NET framework 2.0 included it is 45.7Mb {zipped}.
