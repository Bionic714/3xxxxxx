,ab_cd4073,2006-07-17T13:37Z,"how to play this file? 
help me plzzzzzzzzzz....really wanna see this"
,smiskhasse,2006-07-17T14:13Z,.. and itÂ´s out of sync.
,rimbim,2006-07-17T21:42Z,"but it's not too bad - certainly lighter than the earlier release and the sync is only v. slightly out sometimes. If it's quicker to d/l for you than the pukka one - it's worth trying. on 2 cds, well , I couldn't fit the files on to cds - had to use a dvd"
,knaaud,2006-07-18T02:31Z,ehm.. this isnt the whole thing..
,z0diac,2006-07-18T03:32Z,i hope someone comes out with a complete decent copy of this soon.. the movie was badass in the theatre.. i can't wait to watch it again.
,Young Buck 23,2006-07-31T16:01Z,is this better than the Pukka version people???
,msreal,2006-08-30T20:41Z,"Do you have a torrnent program Goeis??
