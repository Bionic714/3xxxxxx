FLAC is far superior to Mp3, when it comes to quality. Keep up the good work."
,Renaldo,2006-07-30T10:03Z,"Thanks, we need more flac and less mp3. Although, one thing... Compression level 8 is the best, and 0 the worst. Right? Or is it just that 0 is faster and 8 more accurate, but the compression is the same, since you can't ever make flacs lossy?"
,vinylking,2006-08-01T22:26Z,"If yu compare one track ripped with level 0 and the same track with level 8, the level 8 rip is a little bit smaller so I don't think it has to do with speed or so, level 0 must be better."
,vinylking,2006-08-01T22:57Z,"You're right about that level 0 is faster than level 8, but I think it's because level 8 is harder compressed. I compared track 1 of this Van Morrison record. The original wav is 23,0 mb, the level 0 track is 15,4 mb and the level 8 track is 13,7 mb!"
