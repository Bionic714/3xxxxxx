,ninjakaun,2008-04-17T22:00Z,Sorry to be a noob but is it possible and how would you put this on a blank DVD
,apparentlynothing0843,2008-04-24T14:11Z,"@ninjakaun

It's 4.2 GB and a DVD holds 4.7, so if you're talking about putting it on a video dvd, just use roxio or nero, which have functions to do so and will put menus and stuff in there.  Good luck."
,greylion,2008-05-02T00:38Z,"It's 4.26 GiB, or 4.57 GB, but yes, it will fit on one blank DVD."

,zippedfreak,2010-06-30T04:30Z,"is it just me that gets this message when i try to play on VLC media player:
Swedish : ""Ingen lämplig avkodningsmodul:
VLC saknar stöd för ljud- eller videoformatet ""undf"". Tyvärr finns det inget sätt för dig att rätta till detta.
English : No suitable decoder module:
VLC does not support audio or video format ""RECEIVE"". Unfortunately there is no way for you to rectify this.   
(btw, don't know why but ""undf"" got translated to ""RECIEVE"" for some strange reason, undf is not even a swedish word so...)"
