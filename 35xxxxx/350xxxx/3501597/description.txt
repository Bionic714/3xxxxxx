This half-hour comedy focuses on the bizarre experiences of fresh-faced medical intern John "J.D." Dorian (Zach Braff) as he embarks on his healing career in a surreal hospital crammed full of unpredictable staffers and patients ? where humor and tragedy can merge paths at any time.

Joining the rumpled J.D. in his exhilarating brave new world are his college buddy, Chris Turk (Donald Faison, "Clueless") , an intern with a more elite surgical group, and J.D.'s fellow medical intern, the beautiful and driven Elliot Reid (Sarah Chalke, "Roseanne"). Keeping the new interns on their toes are: the fatherly chief of medicine, Dr. Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins); the abrasive, worldly Dr. Perry Cox (John McGinley) , and the caring but slightly jaded nurse Carla Espinosa (Judy Reyes). The hospital janitor (Neil Flynn) also never seems to miss an opportunity to harass his target. (NBC Seasons 1-3 Press Release)

Scrubs is filmed on a real-life hospital. It's the North Hollywood Medical Center, which has gone under severe reconstruction to fit all the equipment and represent Sacred Heart Hospital. Interesting trivia: Sacred Heart was the name of the school that Christa Miller worked; in one episode Zach Braff accidentally calls the Janitor Neil Flynn, which is the actor's real life name.
