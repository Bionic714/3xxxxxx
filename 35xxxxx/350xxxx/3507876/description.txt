Windows 99 NRG_Repack by NRGnet ( http://nrg88.4ya.us/ )
[28-07-2006]

A very fast windows released on 1998 by some hackers. 
Actually it was before Windows 98 SE. 
It is tuned and tweaked, has some nice features, 
multiple desktops, new editor instead of notepad, etc...
It's really stable and much faster than usual 98 SE. 
Hacked, cracked or whatsoever, it's really suitable 
for very old PCs.
No serial required.
You boot up the CD with further CD-Rom support,
and type "setup" if you want to install Windows.
You can use Norton Commander and
Partition Magic before installing Windows.
