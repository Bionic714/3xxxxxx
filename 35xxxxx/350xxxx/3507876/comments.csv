,blackrave123,2006-08-27T20:45Z,"Thanks alot for this! Can you please tell me what's removed (if anything is removed), as the normal version of Windows 98 and Windows 98 SE is a bigger file.
And what are the cons for using this over 98 SE, isn't SE safer?
Thanks."

contain a virus, a fu*째ing bastard virus: W95/CIH :

""W95/CIH is a resident virus that infects Windows programs (PE files). It infects PE files but does not change their size. With the aid of data about the unused fields in these files, it can divide itself in many parts. W95/CIH contains destructive payloads: overwriting BIOS in Flash-ROM and overwriting all the hard drives."""
