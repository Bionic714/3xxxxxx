,Temptation,2006-07-28T10:05Z,"Nice, thanks.. there is a full DVD of this here but I was hoping for a smaller AVI version.. Can I ask where you ripped this from, though?  From a DVD or TV?  I'm asking because this documentary should be 80 mins long, but you indicate it's only 58 mins.. so I'm wondering what got edited out and why.. "
,p2P2p,2006-07-28T17:24Z,"Good question, I'm not sure, there seem to have been 80 min Dutch and Australian release versions made, but I'm not sure why this is only an hour. Was not my intention to censor anything, this file was picked up on another peer network and is very rare so I just wanted to get it out. If anyone has the full version I would also be interested."
,p2P2p,2006-07-28T20:20Z,"There seem to be a few other Eng Sub versions to try, see:

I assume this version has been edited down to 1 hour for TV/Cable purposes. Maybe someone else can shed some light on this?"
,tomtomx,2006-07-28T20:57Z,A film about the reason for the checkpoints: http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3508058
,p2P2p,2006-07-29T03:40Z,"Sure, that documentary balances out the one I posted, but if you have ever talked with a Muslim they will tell you that those people cannot by definition be Muslim. It is a non-violent faith.

Whatever the reason for the checkpoints, there is no justification for the harrasment of the people... humans... you know... homosapians that are featured in this film.

Peace.

,tomtomx,2006-07-29T14:02Z,"I agree. But life isn't black and white. The checkpoints are there out of necessity for self defense. And as long as Hamas & co send out small children and women as well as men armed with explosives (they even use ambulances as transports and schools as weapon depots), the soldiers at the checkpoints have no choice as to examine civilians. "
,tomtomx,2006-07-29T14:03Z,"After a while working under circumstances needing to suspect everybody, it's no wonder that some of them snap..
Things will probably be better when Hamas abandons their written goal of eliminating the state of israel and killing all of jews living there... "
,p2P2p,2006-07-30T02:11Z,"Agreed. I also agree with you that the checkpoints are necessary (which is a shame), however I just can't agree with the methods/tactics used by those manning the checkpoints."
,elsafanni,2006-09-03T21:54Z,"How stupid are you??? This is not selfdefense. The Israelie mlitary are on Palestinian ground, this is an OCCUPATION not SELFDENFENS!!!! the palestinians on the other hand are acting in self defense. There is a great documentary that everyone should see, instead of that Schindles List shit you watch in school theses days.

,tomtomx,2006-09-15T20:09Z,"elsefanny: That depends if you're refering to the arab view that all of Israel belongs to the arabs or if you, like the UN, acknowledge Israels right to exist. Note: The terrorist attacks that are stopped by the checkpoint are those who try to get into Israel. Not those in the occupied territories."
,elsafanni,2006-09-29T15:09Z,"tomtomx - no it doesnt really depend on how you look at it! I've tried to look at it in some other way, but it really doesnt exist. it's like saying today with all the knowledge that we have about the universe, that there is a god.

 You cant just give away somebodyelses land (the palestinians) as the did after WW2, cus the rest of Europe had a guilty conscience. 
UN does NOT support the checkpoints, the wall nor the camps that the sionist have build on palestinian ground. they agreed on several resolutions against the border that Israel has staken out!
the terrorist is the Israeli state and not the poor palestinian people, and as for the people that has reached the lowest point that they see no other way than to blow themselfes up and take some sionist with them well thats just the side-effect of the true terror from the occupation agressor Israel! 

it's wrong, and there is no other way to look at it if you look with you heart and mind!"
,tomtomx,2006-10-23T23:51Z,"elsefanni: If you study history, you'll learn that jews have been living there during all the years since biblical times. Palestinians haven't. Before Arafat invented the term, there weren't even a people called ""palestinians"". It's a myth that ""palestinians"" owned the land. They didn't. It was controlled by the brittish. Before that it was occupied by the turks during the long reign of the ottoman empire. Before that it was occupied by the the romans. And before that the land was jewish. Most of the palestinian arab refugees came from the land that nowadays is called Jordania. The rest of them left israel not to stand in the way of the arab army in 1948. Then they were expelled by the jordanian authorities ond moved to lebanon. Then they were thrown out of Lebanon. Now they live in the west bank and in gaza. The part of them that didn't stay in Israel all the time that is... The other part of them that are isralis citizens and are represented in the israeli parliament..."
,tomtomx,2006-10-23T23:53Z,But i completely agree that the part of the fence/wall and the checkpoints built on land that wasn't israeli before 1967 should be teared down and moved immediately...
,elsafanni,2006-11-11T13:46Z,"tomtomx: well that's not the whole truth is it? Cus I?ve read the bible (atheist though), and guess what, It?s actually mentioned there, but they call it Peleshet (in Hebrew) and is usually translated as Philistia in English. The resemblances in the names are rather sticking isn?t it? And the territorial area is approximately the same as the modern Palestinian Territories. And  I?ve actually read about them and the country as early as in Ramaesses III:s time, but I don?t know if there is any information about them earlier than that (around 1100 bc). And after that they been referred to both this and that, but all names sounding very much alike Palestine and Palestinians (for instence Palashtu by the Syrians, Palaistinêi by the Greeks during the Persian Period, Philistia and so on). 
But all I really want is for this conflict that is causing so much sorrow and hate and death to end, peacefully. So I?m just a god damn hippie in the heart that don?t like to see people suffering and I can?t close my eyes, because ?One sees clearly only with the heart?. "
,tomtomx,2006-11-25T01:19Z,"Elsefanni: Philistia was a (probably) greek colony that covered a part of what is now called the gaza strip. They Philistines werenät a semitic people and disappeared in biblical time and have absolutely no connection to the now living palestinian arabs.

,w000ter,2009-06-11T13:55Z,"""How stupid are you??? This is not selfdefense.""

when you fire the equivalent of over 200,000 rockets landing on us towns and cities when scaled up to the us population yes, its self defense. this documentary is biased as hell because it doesn't acknowledge that these people suffer because they support continued war through terrorism. it is the dog that tries to gain your sympathy by crying after its mauled someone. it is sad to watch, but it is disingenuous to omit the previous incident that caused its suffering."
,sugdenbra,2010-06-11T18:28Z,"I can understand that the jews in these checkpoints are being brutal and treat palestinians worse than shit sometimes cause of the hate they feel for them, but it doesn´t make it right no matter how you choose to loke at it.  

Also, to deliberatly make the rubber bullets moore dangerous with intent to hurt/kill is definitely as evil as it comes. I´m sorry but that is done with evil intents by soldiers laughing, making fun about it, very funny hu??  I don´t care what you have suffered through, to shot at people for fun and also journalist and anyone that doesn´t think alike is just pure evil no matter how much someone tries to make sence out of it.

I hope they can find a peaceful solution to all the problems, cause no matter what side you choose to stand on (or even better being neutral for that matter) it seems that it´s a never ending battle to me.  What I think of almost every day tho is this:  What will happen the day that the Katyusha rocket is swapped out for a nuke.  Cause no man in his right mind can think that they will never ever get their hands on one, for sure it´s a question of time now when the nukes is spreading in the world, basterds selling the techlogy to highest bidder etc."
