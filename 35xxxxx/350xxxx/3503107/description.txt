This is a collection of shit that I have done. They are free to whoever wants to hear them. The RIAA and the BPI can't do shit about them as they are my creations using royalty free loops and samples, and created using various Dance eJay progs and AcidPro.

I do have another set which, once again I'll try and upload.

Enjoy or don't.
