,micahcook,2007-11-29T06:29Z,"sad as fefeto , khardon, and renaissance are, i think you are entitled to your opinion however wrong and racist it may be. Sad that you do not realize the impotence of the individual who was El Hajj Malik El Shabazz. Malcolm X was one of the most dynamic speakers and leaders on the face of this earth and at the vary heart he was a revolutionary. He forsake the teachings of Elijah Mohammad when he became a true student of Islam and he excepted all races of people to join him in his pursuit of universal equality http://faithtube.magnify.net/item/DF8BBHKVDX7561GK"

,Nergalsyn,2010-03-14T05:50Z,"It's amazing how El Haj Malik El Shabazz was called a racist by the very people who were and are racists. The problem was, Minister X had knowledge of self and of true history and that idea that such knowledge could be disclosed, to the oppressed threatened the fabric of white male racist supremacy. Europeans should stop hating Muslims, the crusades are over and the Muslims never had the fictitious holy grail, because it never existed."

,goho91,2012-07-06T11:12Z,"Keep in mind the time Malcolm X grew up and lived in. Illegal White terrorism ravaged and Jim Crow (The legal side) suppressed the black community. The failed theories of Marcus Garvy were out, along with any hope of leaving the US. So, in a defensive stance, the Black radicals of the time became violent and even racist. If it wasn't for the likes of Malcolm X, Stokely Carmichael, and Huey Newton (the humanized, with all its flaws, aspects of the Civil Rights movement) the romanticized and idealized rhetoric of Martin Luther King Jr. wouldn't have been viewed as a legitimate alternative to both blacks and whites. The radicals glamorized the nonviolent. You can't have happiness without sorrow. Can't have glee without frustration.  "
