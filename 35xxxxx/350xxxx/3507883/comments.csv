52 peers on 67.7%. Are you having trouble seeding?

Thanks for Season One!"
,guffboy321,2006-08-10T01:31Z,"Torrent is no longer being tracked by Demonoid for some reason, possibly because it was not being seeded. 

Daniel, you might want to re-upload to Demonoid, or select another tracking site and let us know where to get it."
,guffboy321,2006-08-12T15:27Z,"67.8% now...

Daniel, this torrent is no longer being tracked."
,iamdanielcraig,2006-08-14T05:39Z,"Due to a malfunction of my computer, this torrent is no longer able to be seeded. I am acting with maximum vigour to ensure a reseed can occur within 48-72 hours.
I apologise for any inconvenience this may cause to you.
