,NazGul90,2007-03-11T14:16Z,"hi, are there subs?,norwegen subs?"
,NeverEnuf80,2008-04-26T06:11Z,"will someone please kick this worthless clown off piratebay...""HIGHRES"" is for 720p or above
for those of you that were dropped on your head repeatedly as a child, or are just severely mentally handicapped, this is 304p (720p is from bottom to top...i've noticed a lot of highschool children on here that don't know their ass from the dead cockroaches in the corner of the trailer they live in with their alcoholic, child molesting father)
so, 720p refers to 1280x720 video, and 1080p is 1920x1080 video...960x540 probably could slip in under ""hires"" if it's not just upconverted 480p material"
