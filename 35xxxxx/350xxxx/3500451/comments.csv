,thankgodthereawayhame,2006-07-03T02:24Z,does this show his penalty
,stega,2006-07-03T02:46Z,If Rooney cant take that from a friend in ManU he shouldnÂ´t be on the pitch. I even think heÂ´s smiling...
,videopac,2006-07-03T08:22Z,"Haha! If you are so stupid that you can't even handle some shit during the game then you should really try to get smarter. Gosh! I can understand that the English like Rooney; he would appeal to the hooligans... all muscles and no brain! LOL!

Get over it; you weren't good enough to go further in the tournament. That's it!"
,mafd1,2006-07-03T09:35Z,what kinda uploads this....its bollox u greetin faced dobber..beardyboy...beardy twat more like..FO an get a life 
,nov_sm,2006-07-03T10:06Z,"It was third time since Euro 2000 that England looses against Portugal!
Rooney deserves red card and FIFA agrees!"
,DeadPresident,2006-07-03T11:52Z, Now digest that defeat you xenofobic english fools!
,j.t.,2006-07-03T13:12Z,"english men are real northern men and portugal men are more like crying and cheating women!
how can rooney hit to the balls of the portugal ""men"", if they didn't have them?
btw- i'm not english (as you see by writing), but i just hate pretending so called footballers!"
,acolster,2006-07-03T14:33Z,"Shut the fuck up all you portugese arse sucking pricks. You are only mad because you live in a country that is non-deserving of life and the fact that you are in the semis is because the people you call football players are nothing more than egotistical cheating wankers. While the pertugese men are cheating at football their wives are cheating on them with English blokes because the pertugese men are fucking pussies, got it fuck weasel?!?!?!?!?!!?"
,nov_sm,2006-07-03T15:45Z,"Some English accept well the defeat, but i see that others don't, and if they feel that, with the oldest allied in Europe, with other country they break all( yeah, i know ""hoolligan"" is an English word not Portuguese).
And since that someone start talking about Portuguese woman and not football, i enter on the same game: English woman are famous in the Algarve, wonder why!"
,beardyboy,2006-07-03T17:27Z,"I don't think anyone can argue with the fact that he headbutted Rooney, which is a red card offence, he should be banned for at least one match by FIFA because there is video evidence.

England also played better than Portugal after Rooney was sent off."
,mafd1,2006-07-03T19:37Z,why dont u FO to a forum to discuss the merits of it ...could i suggest ..the xenophobic superiority complex forum for excessive masterbators
,beardyboy,2006-07-03T20:03Z,mafd1 where have i been xenophobic? Maybe you should look up what it means and stop playing around with big words that you don't fully understand.
,mafd1,2006-07-03T20:20Z,"mmmm ..nope pretty sure i nailed it, the fact u uploaded this shite speaks for itself really...wots next uploading Tims wimbledon conspiracy"
,beardyboy,2006-07-03T20:49Z,"xenophobe: A person unduly fearful or contemptuous of that which is foreign, especially of strangers or foreign peoples.

I have never had a go at him for being a foreigner, simply that what he did was unfair and also that that he headbutted Rooney, for which he should serve the appropriate punishment."
,beemerlad,2006-07-04T00:33Z,i think your find its Ronaldo thats a cry baby as the match b4 the england game when he had to come off for a little cut and a dead leg. I cant wait till he gets back to England . He won't last five minutes!!!! 
,mikewright4,2006-07-04T14:09Z,Nice civilized way to handle defeat.  Not since the witch hunts of Salem have we seen the like.  Grow up you english losers!!!!  Brazil are blaming themselves cos they would be too embarrassed to hound out an individual.  You would think with all the times that you lose that you might be getting slighter more gracious
,beardyboy,2006-07-04T16:57Z,"Again, this is not about foreigners nor is it about losing, it's about the unsporting behaviour of Cristiano Ronaldo coupled with red card offence."
,mafd1,2006-07-04T19:28Z,ohhh is it ...sure it is ....what about shrek the granny molester then? dont see u uploading a clip of him bursting a players bawbag or assaulting Ronaldo....conveniently forget did ya.....sour grapes any1
,Donnie Vegas,2006-07-11T02:56Z,"Deary Daery Me... I havent laughed so much for a while. The top comment award has to go tomafd1 for his comments about Rooney, calling him Shrek the Granny Molester. Top Darts!!!

Oh and btw football sucks..try playing net ball, now thats a real mans game."
,mafd1,2006-07-12T18:23Z,net ball ...wot do u think the point is in football u fud!...
