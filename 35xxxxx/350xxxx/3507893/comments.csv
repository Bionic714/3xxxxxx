,shdwwarlord,2006-11-29T01:52Z,"I've noticed that with most Blizzard run games you cannot used cracked copies (I.E. 1:1 Cd-R Copies or Isos) as most of the copies end prematurely generally sighting some kind of disc error. Blizzard has gone to great lengths to prevent piracy and make it very difficult for the newer to dodge such probelms.

Any have a clue as to why such errors occur and how we may circumvent them?"

,MisplacedFate1313,2008-05-05T04:53Z,"Finally, a quality torrent. Keep it alive, yar."
,AlexxxAnarchist,2008-06-22T21:27Z,"if anyone is having trouble with this, here's instructions to help:

Download this torrent (and be polite! seed for a while)

Go here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3511799/Keygen_for_Warcraft_III_the_frozen_throne

and download that keygen.

when frozen throne torrent is done, mount BOTH files with Daemon Tools (imo, the other virtual drives have problems with warcraft)

an autoplay.exe should pop up. choose to Install the frozen throne.

when prompted for a cd-key, open that other file i told u to download. its a keygen for the frozen throne. click generate and then type the cd key it gave u, into the form on the installation for the frozen throne. it'll continue, and everything is fine and dandy.

hope this helps, 


alexxx anarchist"
,MisplacedFate1313,2009-02-08T10:33Z,"Not to be rude, but anyone who had trouble with this didn't know what they were doing. The daemon mount, the install, the serial, everything works perfectly. I've seeded this several times over so people who already had a W3 iso don't have to dl both. Obviously blizzard doesn't allow battlenet for stolen games, that should have hit you awhile ago. Thanks iix."
,Mirzou,2009-08-16T23:17Z,I have the game ... but my cd is fucked.. so if i download this and write the Cd-key from my game ... will it be possible for me to play on battle.net then?
