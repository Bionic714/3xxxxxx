,Sully343,2006-07-14T03:51Z,"I added another seed at 140kB/s which should bring total seedage to about 200kB/s. The best i could muster. I don't think I like multi tracker. It split up the swarm when TPB tracker crapped out for a minute and doesn't report the true swarm #s, right now TPB shows 0 seeders 7 leechers I show 2 seeds 74 leechers."
,ctnet,2006-07-14T09:58Z,How about putting it under Games
,theorem,2006-07-15T06:52Z,looks like most of us are stuck at 58% .. any seeders coming back ?   I can't see the other tracker.
,Sully343,2006-07-15T12:24Z,"Heh, games musta hit wrong one. Anyway everytime TPB tracker temporarily craps out (which is often) everybody gets bumped to the secondary tracker. right now 2 seeds 83 peers on secondary. If your stuck on the TPB tracker try to have your client manualy connect to http://tracker.phogotorrents.com:2006/announce

My client switches back and forth everyonce and a while. Didn't realize multitracker would split up the swarm so bad, but TPB tracker i guess gets overloaded. right now the torrent is only 60% seeded so your fine, a bunch of people are connected to peers on both trackers so it will work out, just the stats are messed up because you can't see both swarms."
,master89,2006-08-09T00:31Z,Any one knows what are the best settings in BitComet for 4 Mb internet connection?
,Sully343,2006-08-12T07:37Z,"There are still lots of seeders, you can't see them all right away because they're spread out over a few trackers. If your client has multitracker support it will switch back and forth and you'll be able to see more.

These versions are for Win XP, you have problems with the originals because they were for win95.

Best settings for bitcomet are uninstall. Get utorrent or azureus. I had to ban all the bitcomet clients during the inital seed because they were messing things up with bad download priority."

,bow-chicka-wah-wah,2007-10-12T14:44Z,I wish you could put all C&C games as separate torrents.
,AdamantineGear,2007-10-19T06:57Z,"A very, very good compilation, and even the steep DL size is okay for what you get.


Also, @ Red Angelz: I think he meant ""money"" as slang for a good thing, why sell when you can seed, after all? ;P"

,caution1,2009-10-17T14:46Z," DrGiggity at 2009-08-23 23:34 CET:
I really wanted to say that i DO have a legal copy of this game and ther is no reason to put the DVD in at the start, it NEVER asks that and as far as i know i never installed and nocd cracks.

ok first of all you do need the cd crack because this image is not a cloned cd image now if it was a cloned cd image you would not need the cracks and secondly if you are getting the message please put the right cd in first add the crack then play the game."
