,J.Tramiel,2006-07-15T11:28Z,"If you never heard of the Amiga demo scene, don't bother downloading, cuz you just won't understand."
,sputnikk666,2006-07-25T19:15Z,"Is this ""old"" ECS graphic type demos or is this newer ACS type demos with higher resolution and more colors?"
,J.Tramiel,2006-07-31T23:25Z,"""ACS"" ??? There's no such thing!

3 Types of Amiga GFX are:

OCS - Old Chip Set
ECS - Enhanced Chip Set
AGA - Advanced Graphics Architecture

As the title of this compilation suggests, all of the demos contained on here are OCS."

,shadowfire2,2006-08-04T06:38Z,"ah cool, this one I have to download.. /ex Quartex European Organizer, Amiga Scene :)"
,J.Tramiel,2007-07-19T21:35Z,Thanks for the kind comments.
,BaboucheMan,2007-11-06T05:56Z,"Hi J.,

I really appreciated watching the  DVDs although I feel even more at home with the first one. To me, the feeling from the PC demoscene is completely different.

I noticed the sound is sometimes unaccurate, I know it must have been difficult to set up the whole thing so I don't complain but may be your computer  needs more ram :) 

Anyway, I am sure many Amiga freaks would be happy with a 4th DVD featuring groups such as Red Sector, Alcatraz, the Silents...
By the way, can you or someone else tell me which group made a demo animating the logo from Magic Bytes ?"
,J.Tramiel,2007-11-27T19:50Z,"Hey man,

thanks for your kind words -

hehe I know the timing is a bit pooped on some of them (I have an Athlon XP 3200+ with 1GB Ram - so I don't think performance would be an issue)

This must be down to MPEG encoding - it just can't handle some of them CRAZY Amiga effects!

You will be pleased to know that I am currently working on OldSkool Volume 2 - Should be out at the end of this week!"
