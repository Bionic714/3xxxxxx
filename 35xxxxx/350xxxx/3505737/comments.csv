Req: Aerosoft cheyenne SP1a"
,The_Hangar_18,2006-07-21T20:07Z,"I think if u upgrade to SP1 the gauge will overwrited, and so i think it did not work."
,FSSR.Lav,2006-07-21T20:52Z,"Dear 01T,
Aren't you tired of always requesting the same thing (request Cheyenne SP1a) ? I know most leechers from TPB doesn't know what patience is, but please make an effort: you and all the others that always make requests and requests without giving us something (new).
Also a little courtesy would be very welcome when someone makes a request.

To continue this blow of mouth (you are not concerned by the following words 01T, at least I think), I'm tired of all these ""Wall Street's guys"" who only know one word: seed! Huh folks, give us a break ok?

As far as I am concerned, I'll stop providing new files as long as the environment here will not change."
