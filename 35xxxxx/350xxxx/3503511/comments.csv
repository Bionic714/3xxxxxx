,Saragani,2006-07-15T19:17Z,"Can soneone reseed it?
There is a new exploit that affect all versions below 2.17 and I would like to have my forums fixed.

Anyway, I'm willing to try Nulling this version."
,Saragani,2006-07-15T19:31Z,"Ok, I managed to get it. I will do my best of trying to null this (And I hope I will do fine).

The only thing I nulled before was the paches that fixed a previous exploit."
,bumbika,2006-07-15T19:43Z,I'm seeding 0-24
,Saragani,2006-07-15T23:00Z,"I made a Null version.

It should be fine, but if some expert here can confirm that then it would be more than OK.
I removed hotlinks, call backs and more.


Link is on yousendit (I'm having problems seeding torrents I have created. For some reason lots of people are having problems connecting me).

Please create a mirror/torrent for sharing it with others.

I tried writting megaupload inthe link above, and everytime it gave me database error (Are you blacklisting megaupload ???)

So I had to replace it with SERVER.
