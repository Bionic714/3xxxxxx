Bruce Lee: The Man, the Myth (1976) also known as "Li Hsiao Lung chuan chi".

 An action-filled kung fu movie telling the story of the greatest of them all.
Bruce Lee. The story starts with the ambulance picking up Bruce Lee who is fighting for his life and flashes back to tell the story of his life, including his days in America and his days in the Far East. A good story!!!!
