1. Unrar until you get 5 ISO files
2. Run Deamon tools
3. Right click Deamon and select the first ISO filed named CD 1
4. It ill begin to install and ask you for the next CD's in order
5. When it's done, click on FarCry, it asked me to insert correct CD to fix this, you ONLY mount the first CD to run the game

Enjoy."

,VinceIP,2009-01-05T03:27Z,"This game DOES WORK PERFECTLY. There's no problems.

1. Extract the CDs, mount CD 1 with Daemon Tools and install.
2. Mount CD 1 TO PLAY! You shouldn't even need a crack. I didn't.
3. UPDATE the game to 1.4. Here is the patch: http://www.ubi.com/US/Downloads/Info.aspx?dlId=691 (Download and install 1.40 Cumulative patch, not standalone)

The patch should fix any problems you have with the screen being blue and foggy. You DO NOT have to play with the graphics quality low. If you're using Vista, trying running it in compatibility mode for Windows XP. If you did need to use a no cd crack, make sure to reapply it.

You CAN'T play this game online (as far as I know) unless you find a proper CD key. I haven't found a working key anywhere, but good luck and share if you find one."

-If your mouse doesn't move the camera, go in Controls and hit Defaults. For some reason, clicking on this fixes the problem.

-Make sure you use ''Far Cry {ALL VERSIONS} [MULTI] Unprotected EXE'' from GameCopyWorld.com AFTER patching Far Cry to version 1.4 (http://www.ubi.com/US/Downloads/DownloadFile.aspx?dfId=3429)

-If your graphics are shit and keep blinking or textures on trees are messed up, go in your Far Cry folder. Open up ''system.cfg'' with Notepad. Scroll down to the line that says ''r_driver=d3xd39'' and replace the latter with ''OpenGL''.
