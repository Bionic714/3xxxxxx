,beatnick,2006-07-25T12:55Z,Bas Vs W. Silva would be a nice matchup. 2 X Strikers going for each other
,PeNkis,2006-08-06T20:17Z,"Since when is Bas a striker?
His strenght is that he doesn't have a strenght."
,pestosv,2011-01-28T15:04Z,Bas has always been a striker. They had him on that national geographic fight show to see how much damage an MMA striker does. In pancrase he was a feared striker even with only palm strikes to the head. He knocked guys out with palm strikes. He had almost no takedown defense when he started. Granted he still won quite a bit by submission. I think he learned most of his all round knowledge after retirement.
