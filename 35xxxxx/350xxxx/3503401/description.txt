Here's a vinyl I had come across and had to dub simply because of the obscurity of it.

Unlike their music, this two-side interview vinyl dub contains some swearing. I'm not offended or anything but still it was sort of surprising to hear "HE'S TAKING A SHIT!!" within the first few minutes of the interview.

Lineage: JVC L-A55 (turntable) > Yamaha Stereo Amplifier CR-220 > Phones jack (mono) > M-Audio FastTrack USB > Roxio CD Spin Doctor > Sound Studio 2.1.1 beta 3 (clean up and editing out silence) > xACT 1.5 beta 4 > YOU, FINALLY

I could not get the RCA output on my amplifier working so since the record sounded like it was recorded in mono I just ran the output throught the phones jack and into my USB interface. The recording is very clear and I doubt any loss in quality as the quality of the record was very poor to begin with.
