,Rexxxifon,2006-08-06T03:34Z,"Huleo, don't post the same requests in every torrent."
,MrAnthonyWong,2006-08-06T05:01Z,"from my experience thuis overwrites (if you have) thomas kwong's VHHH scenery, with a quite crappy VHHH airport.

so you get good surrounding areaa but HORRIBLE airport. unless there is a way to put it underneath. 

also i didnt like the textures for teh ground. i'd say if not already get the Thomas Kwong scenery on AVSIM for VHHH. its more worth it.

but nonetheless thanks for the upload. very helpful!"
,MrAnthonyWong,2006-08-06T05:04Z,"btw huleo, is the aerosoft just the Cloud 9 scenery? because its already here. if im mistaken sorry."
,MrAnthonyWong,2006-08-06T05:05Z,"same withamsterdam, i think thats cloud 9. just download the ""Washington Reagan"" scenery from here for the crack inside. and just use it with the trials from Cloud 9's site."

vhhh2005b.zip  on AVSIM"
,jueljuel,2006-09-15T21:58Z,ATC : I believe ther're many who think this is a great Airport & scĂŠnery. I think this one has got much more nice scenery than the freeware you're talking about!! Maybe you don't like it -ok but this scenery is - in my oppinion- no crapp!
