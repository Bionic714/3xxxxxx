Om - Conference of the Birds [Holy Mountain; 2006]


---


"Comprised of two songs that build on OM's use of cyclical rhythm, riff, and vocal intonation, the duo's new album Conference of the Birds blends metal, chant, drone, dub, and psychedelia. The band's lyrics expound upon the structure of the universe, potentiality, and freedom from the physical body. Engineered by Billy Anderson and produced by the band, Conference of the Birds progresses beyond their debut, Variations on a Theme, with more fully realized songwriting and production."



This is one of the most immaculate, hypnotic and powerful albums I have heard for many many many years. - David Tibet, Current 93
