Check the main TBP page, almost at the bottom.  Or, go to utorrent.com and download it.  That's a proggy to download the data, which the .torrent file points to, essentially."

,sporg,2007-03-23T20:33Z,"The file comes as an .NRG which is a nero image for creating a cd/dvd. To use the file with other dvd creators you will have to get a converter. The one I use is called ""MagicISO"" it can be downloaded just search for it with google.  You must then use the .ISO image to create a DVD. "
