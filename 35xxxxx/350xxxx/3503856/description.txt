This torrent has all the Cell Phone Software you're going to need to hook up your Cell Phone to you Computer. I originally started searching for software like this when I bought a Motorola V3c Razr from Telus Mobility. It took me a while to find all the files I needed to properly attach my V3c to my PC. This torrent has the drivers for the Razr phone. It has all the software you're going to need to do various things with your phone on your PC. I also included AudaCity (an audio editing program) because I've heard that this is the most popular program that people use to edit their songs before uploading them to their phone. There is a LAME MP3 encoder which you're going to need for AudaCity to encode MP3 files.

The software included in this torrent are:

-Motorola Phone Tools (after installing make sure you update it to the latest version)
-BitPim
-MotoKit
-Motorola PST Phone Programmer (might be illegal to have this one, just letting you know ;) )
-P2K
 -P2KCommander
 -P2KMan
 -P2KSeem
 -P2KTools
-Razr V3c USB Driver (VenomXt from ossn.net)
-AudaCity with LAME MP3 Encoder

That seems to be about it. I think there's probably a few little tools that I may have missed in there.

Anyways, I hope this torrent is the answer to all that searching you've been doing. Why didn't someone make this before I started looking :P.

To all the people who has completed the download, PLEASE seed as my Azureus program crashes in the middle of the night, hence I can't seed 24/7.
