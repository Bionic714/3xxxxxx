,iconoclast2000,2008-06-20T08:58Z,So does anyone know -- is there really a rootkit here? I tried reading the flashback.info site via an online translator (I don't speak Swedish) but those never work very well. If there IS a rootkit embedded in this download do we know which file or files could be deleted to safely allow the rest to work? 
,Regedit1218,2008-07-03T17:47Z,Can someone plzz seed. Thx all!
,Regedit1218,2008-07-03T17:52Z,"Damn! You all Rock , thx downloading now..any word on the rootkit issue?"
,Regedit1218,2008-07-08T05:01Z,"Please seed , I am stuck at 94% thx all!"
,PirateERo619,2008-10-04T21:25Z,"About the rootkit issue, I don't read Swedish but there is a reply that listed these files:

1. kernel32.dll   | En viktig del av kerneln | Lär vara för att skydda viruset elller liknande
2. user32.dll      | Styr användare          | Skyddar viruset mot dina program och/eller döljer kontot det körs på
3. sock32.dll     | Styr internet              | Döljer virusets internetåtkomst
3. ntoskrnl.exe  | Kerneln                     | Loggning och skydd mot antivirus

And I can guess those would be the ones but maybe that will help?  I'll try and translate it and come back 

Great work Arjun143, ALL OF YOUR TORRENTS are frickin AWESOME!!"
