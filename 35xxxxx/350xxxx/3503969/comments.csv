,frankie79,2006-07-16T19:44Z,"@Belga1 ...It doesn't work in this version of Spy Sweeper, I've updater v1.5 that maby will work but I'm not sure."
,frankie79,2006-07-16T19:48Z,@Barfco ...there's 30 keys that you can use. But I think a new updater is the solution soon.
,belga1,2006-07-16T21:34Z,"Hello Frankie79,
Yes maybe..I use the Spysweeper vers 4.5.8 build 683..and it's work fine.The actual definition is 719."
,Barfco,2006-07-17T04:53Z,"Thanks mate, will give it a try. I did find a backdoor link on a site a while back that actually gave you year. It's a neat program.
I'm using pestpatrol atm, I think it was a corperate one, but everytime I uninstal it and stick it in again it adds a year for some unknown reason :)

I'd go with this or pestpatrol everytime.

There is getting to be load of shitty infected stuff, perv porn and fucking spamed referal links appearing over this site. great to see a nice torrent from a helpful guy."
