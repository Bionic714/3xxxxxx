,a.schweitzer,2009-01-28T06:10Z,"Awesome torrent, thanks uploader! Really good quality, nice to read (though the pages are slightly slanted occasionally, but not a problem at all). Includes an ISO with the CD that would come with the textbook. Freeking sweet! I've been seeding for weeks, over 10.5 ratio already :)"
,Station4,2009-01-30T21:48Z,"One of the best textbooks I've ever seen, thanks!
Has anyone seen a torrent of the lab manual to accompany this book?"
,qwertyi,2009-09-01T21:00Z,"This is pretty lousy, actually.  I'm currently looking for a better copy.

No OCR, ghosting, crooked pages, no chapter bookmarks, only the most desperately poor student will want this."
,preludexl,2009-11-02T06:55Z,"Seriously, why would a dumb fool write down that there is a virus when there isnt one? You bitch and moan and the say, oops, nevermind, my bad, there isnt one.  If you arent sure, then shut up. And do the bonehead who complains. You try scanning a whole book a-hole. Go buy one like everyone else and stop bitching. Like someone is going to be stupid enough to scan a really good copy for the likes of you for free? Go suck a big one."
