Sixth album from the child prodigy pop-classical violinist.
Produced by Youth and aimed at a young pop audience, it
incorporates influences from the dance world and sees Mae
co-writing several of the tracks, exploring further than
ever before into the techno (or rather not acoustic)
aspects of her work.
