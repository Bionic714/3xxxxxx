This movie portrays the drug scene in Berlin in the 70s, following tape recordings of Christiane F. 14 years old Christiane lives with her mother and little sister in a typical multi-storey apartment building in Berlin. She's fascinated by the 'Sound', a new disco with most modern equipment. Although she's legally too young, she asks a friend to take her (to David Bowie). There she meets Detlef, who's in a clique where everybody's on drugs. Step by step she gets drawn deeper into the scene.
