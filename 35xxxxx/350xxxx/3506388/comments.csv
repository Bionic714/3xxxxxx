It's easy to say, isn't it? Not everyone has the money to upgrade his/her PC. Some are happy that they have at least a P1 or P2."

,KOLClamJuice,2006-09-26T05:53Z,"Christ! I still enjoy playing around with my 486SX/33. With 16MB ram and a quad speed cd rom. That shit is tight. It's the pc equivalent to playing a classic NES. You bust out your shoebox containing the 6 floppies for ""Rise of the Triad"" or your dust, scratched copies of ""The 7th Guest"" or ""Cyberwar"" and you're in classic PC heaven!"
