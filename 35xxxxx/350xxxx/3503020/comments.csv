,Jackass Jimm,2006-09-17T00:58Z,"Davethenave has left us to fend for ourselves and most probably won't upload anymore (he left disk 7 at 47% and disk 8 at 6%)...its been like that for a month and a half.

I am growing weary of uploading constantly. I've been uploading since June. So, I'll be stopping my seeding of this series (disk 1 - 6) on September 31st. Seriously, no one seeds here. I think there was a time when I saw like 2 other seeders...for like half a week.

Well, anyway, just wanted to inform you...so make sure you put as much priority into these torrents."
,davethenave,2007-02-07T05:19Z,"as of Feb 7 2007:

I see 85.64.249.91:35537
has 97%   of complete file.       I'm doing my part to re seed missing parts.    

Help me.

Keep these files turned on for share."

,Pam25,2007-12-23T08:17Z,"Hello to All:

I don't know about the video course. The course I attended at one of Tefl International school's however was less than professional.

The owner Bruce Veldhuisen has more interest that teaching English. He also owns bars in most locations where he has schools.

I was one of several students invited for a ""night out"" with Bruce. After a few drinks he made his intentions toward several of the female students clear.

He indicated he could do much to secure works for his ""favorite"" students.

I was offended and told him he should stay home with his Thai wife not hit up on students.

I completed the course and applied for work presenting The TEFL International certificate.

Each time the school where I applied would check my reference with TEFL international and no job was offered.

Something else I ran across:http://teflblacklist.blogspot.com/2007/11/tefl-international.html
seems they do in deed keep a black list."

If you are using Utorrent as your file share, highlight each file, double click then paste the above trackers.

The video course torrent files were created more than a year ago. It only has one tracker for pirate bay and is no longer recommended. Add all of the above trackers will make a big difference for connected peers and download speed.

,daveshelper,2008-01-06T03:32Z,"Thank you:

To all who  seed this series of 25 disk. It's a long list and large files.

To the rest, I'm asking your help. 

Please... After you complete a download Leave it to seed until a couple more people can take your place.

I've tried off and on for more than a year to make this teaching course available.

This is my last run. 

I'll be off the net in a couple of weeks. It's up to you whether these torrents live or die."
,Fike2308,2008-02-20T06:03Z,"I would advise everyone to steer clear of actually taking this course in person.....they will take your money and run OR keeping adding charges to the original fee.....they are scam artists and if you have been ripped off by these people in anyway please contact me with your complaint(s) because I am keeping tabs on this group:

Also, Pam25, I read your comment and have heard similar things about sexual harrassment going on in Ban Phe and I'd really like to get in touch with you if that's possible and anyone else you took the course with.

www.teflintl.com is a scam and they need to be stopped! Spread the word!
