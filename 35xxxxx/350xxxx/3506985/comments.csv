,Grail29,2006-07-27T03:26Z,so any chance we can get the 2nd disc or we suposed to guess the rest ?
,marcoze,2006-07-27T04:30Z,"you jagoffs need to learn how to download torrents, i just watched this torrent and it comes with BOTH disks RARed up seperately and the movie is 100% complete even dipping into the credits. Also its GREAT FUCKING QUALITY!"
,johnnyxmas,2006-07-27T06:24Z,"OMG seirously. You guys are fucking idiots. It even says it right there in the file listing: CD 2. 


THIS MOVIE IS COMPLETE, AND EXCELLENT QUAL FOR A SCREENER."
,Aramis,2006-07-27T15:41Z,no seeds or peers? is my dht just fucked?
,kinghajj,2006-07-27T23:19Z,"Umm, if these are SVCDs, why are they 800+ MBs? Will they work if I burn them to a DVD? (In fact, why not just release it as a DVD-R to begin with?)"
,Smoke Blunts,2006-07-28T03:20Z, Im at 100% with this but now that im done downloading I dont know what to do to watch it.  I dont have a dvdr just a cdr.  how can I watch it?  I have a japanese computer cause Im in Japan and its hard to do with no eng.  Ill seed everyday everything if I can figure this out.  Thanks
,xmbencex,2006-07-28T10:40Z,yo this download made my day seriously thanks!!
,Kome_iiv,2006-07-28T22:56Z,"PERFECT screener. Developers got tallent.  wish it was on 1 dvd instead of 2, and if your new to burning BIN/CUE and your a noob, dont bother with this. its a confusing burn."
,FJB,2006-07-29T06:44Z,If anyone could link me to a bin/cue burning guide that'd be great.
,Kome_iiv,2006-07-29T13:44Z,http://www.afterdawn.com/guides/archive/bin_cue_with_nero.cfm
,whimsical84,2006-07-29T20:02Z,Why is it when i burn it to a dvd the sound gets fucked. But thats only when i try to play it on a dvd player if i play that dvd on my comp it plays fine. Anyone know what iam messing up?
,ansimega,2006-07-29T21:07Z,I used converted the bin to an iso file to burn it with nero. I cannot play the files. All I can only hear skippy scratchy noises. Can some one tell me what software and codecs they used?
,JasonBourne,2006-07-30T00:43Z,"all you moronic bastards who can't work a bin file should shut off your computer and run into the woods. You are so fucking stupid. And you can't even google it, you need someone to hold your hand. You annoy the fuck out of normal people. Shut up."
,ansimega,2006-07-30T01:02Z,"Any ways, when I use Nero 6.6 to burn this BIN file on a disk, when it is finished i see no video and I get scambled sound. What codecs do you all use? their is no cue file that comes with this download. Any one who is to ignorant to help is probably one of thoose little bitches who ways 130 pounds and lives off their mom's nipples. All i need to know is what codecs do you all use?  Thats right you little bitches!!! the only thing in life you half decent at is burning videos to cds/dvds, other then that you should have been a swallowed you pathetic loozerz!!!"
,ansimega,2006-07-30T02:14Z,"hey JasonBourne, unless you want me to turn your life into a snuff film i suggest you shut the fuck up"
,Kome_iiv,2006-07-30T10:50Z,you need to burn the CUE FILE people.. not the BIN. i already left the freaking link up there ^
,ansimega,2006-07-30T16:18Z,do we make are own cue because I don't see any cue files
,ansimega,2006-07-30T16:20Z,"never mind the cue files are in
clerks.2.haf.cd1.rar
and 
clerks.2.haf.cd2.rar
ill burn thoose and see if i still have problems"
,rann187,2006-07-30T21:27Z,"right the fuck on jason, a comment section for a torrent is not the place to ask for tips/help/guides/howmanytimesishouldshakewhenipiss

use any major search engine and learn like every other human with a brain does..

fucking beautiful job on this cam too, never seen one as nice"
,m2dane,2006-07-30T22:07Z,i was wondering where is the middle of the movie? cd1 stops with randall and alias and then cd2 starts with bankie  leaving the restauraunt.
,spoot,2006-07-31T04:50Z,"why beat you as children?  you cant take a couple seconds and say that a bin/cue is a type of image file.  just burn them to a cd/ load them into a virtual drive/ or play them with vlc media player.  

wow, that was hard.  everyone is a noob at one point or another.  you learn by getting help from people.   if you dont want to help someone then you can say google it.  not fucking bash them and call them a complete and total idiot"
,Nick39891,2006-07-31T09:20Z,"Wow this looks wonderful. Thanks!!!!
Also, I was wondering....how many times do you think I should shake when I piss? Thanks in advance."
,Kome_iiv,2006-07-31T18:43Z,"If you shake more then twice, its for pleasure. =)"
,Greasye,2006-07-31T20:41Z,"Could someone please seed this? I'm at 99.9%.

Thanks."
,imprezawill,2006-08-01T04:42Z,"Might I ask why I get NO sound from either of the CDs?

I have the K++ Mega Codec Pack installed, and some others that I use for MKV's and stuff. Is this encoded in a specific one?"
,CurtisC,2006-08-01T07:58Z,Nice rip but what's with the sound cutting every 5 seconds. That shit get's annoying.
,CurtisC,2006-08-01T08:00Z,"Also, you guys don't have to burn this on a disc to watch it. Just use VLC's player."
,eek111,2006-08-01T08:12Z,"Just a noob here. I'm amazed at the stupid questions people ask. There's a link on the main page, telling you how to do it, step by step. From there, you can just Google. This isn't difficult, folks. I've downloaded stuff in 15 different formats. I've yet to have trouble opening, playing or burning stuff to cd/dvd. 
Why can't I get video/sound? How do I open a .rar file? How fucking stupid can you be? I've come to the exciting conclusion, the entire human race is doomed. We're just too stupid to survive. 
Darwin called. There's 5 billion open seats on the extinction bus. "
,Kome_iiv,2006-08-01T13:43Z,I got sound on the 2 cds that I burned. maby its just your player?
,JasonBourne,2006-08-01T23:13Z,eek111! You speak the truth. Luckily the busdriver is too stupid to work a manual clutch so we have a little while longer.
,SBC,2006-08-07T08:52Z,"Awesome Torrent! Surprisingly good quality, too! And funny as hell!

I came pretty close to pissing myself during the 'Pillow Pants' scene!"
,Kalath,2006-08-09T01:16Z,"awesome quality, awesome movie!"
,Troy666,2006-08-09T19:30Z,I do have Problems with the Sound with the VLC Player. It has constantly short dropouts. Anyone else? 
,shipy,2006-08-13T18:24Z,"Hey i'm having a slight problem Cd1 when i unrar it, it says it has no content?
Cd2 works fine no problem its just Cd1

thanks for your help"
,mR. Moi,2006-08-14T11:15Z,seed please
,jook11,2006-08-18T01:28Z,"This movie was filmed less than a mile from my house. I went by the set several times during production. The Mooby's building used to be a Burger King, but one with particularly bad food..."
,Kelvin Jack,2006-08-19T23:35Z,REQUEST: The sisterhood and The zero boys. Anyone out there got this?
,LostThoughts,2006-08-20T03:38Z,need more seeders plz.....
,cruelmemory,2006-09-07T01:18Z,Need to get a seeder. I missed this when it was released. Please?
,sbtx,2006-09-21T00:24Z,The sound does cut every 5 seconds. Really annoying.
,mr.bill,2006-10-19T19:55Z,"Thanks for the file. Contrary to the prior post, I had no difficulties playing these and did not find the sound cutting out at all. I admit I never burned the images to SVCDs, though I can't imagine that would matter. XBMC played the bins just fine as-is.  I used IsoBuster to extract the MPG files to my hard drive and watched it using PowerDVD first just to test. Good quality for a CAM. The audio was decent too, if anything the stereo separation seemed a bit wide but in no way detracted from the viewers experience. If you're a fan of Kevin Smith you will like this one too."
