,sinsliveforever,2006-07-01T20:03Z,"i have it already on 1 disc... dvd shrink anyone?  and here you go if you want it, this is of course allso been rebuild; http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3403334
I only asked in the first place because i dident like the ending... "
[T],silvia-,2006-07-01T21:56Z,"You have the two dvd into the torrent file and it is the complete movie.

I don't know anything about the link that sinsliveforever gives, maybe another version of this movie."
,sinsliveforever,2006-07-01T23:40Z,"same movie, or series.. silvia try dvd shrink (if you want) and did you like the ending? Its of course one of kings better films... I know kings name is only a pruduct now, or he writes the scripts but other direct but i like to think of them as kings movies..  even if the most ofÂ´em  is b-movies at best.. 
And this is said by one that wants ""the dark tower"" series to be be made to a couple movies... even bad ones=) "
,daqck,2006-07-03T15:20Z,"i liked the ending of the movie, nice to see evil win (in the movies).
one of the things i remember about this movie wasa when he was to come and confront the town's ppl at 9 p.m. about (you know what) and at the time it rang 9 o'clock in the movie it rang 9 o'clock in with our chining clock (you couldn't time that better)"
[T],silvia-,2006-07-03T15:54Z,"I liked the end too, only a few times the evil wins, ahahaha!, and about the script from me one of the best from the author."
,sinsliveforever,2006-07-03T16:24Z,"donÂ¨t get my wrong; i like it when the bad guys win its more autentic^^ But a little more ""evil"" in the ending whold have been better.."
,daqck,2006-07-03T23:31Z,"If you  think about  evil winning,it would have to destroy everything. that is the nature of evil but pure evil can not win or destroy everything as is would also destroy itself as it can not exist without good, one can not exist without the other. evil will be there in one form or another. but its only a film and they do things like that so they can make sequels. anyway thats my 2 cents"
