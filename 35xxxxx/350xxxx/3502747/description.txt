My first upload on here and it's a scenery package that has been requested a few times so here it is. Includes afcad and all updates. 


I'm looking for one request, Beijing scenery from ai-net.com. If anyone has it, please share it. 

Because of my poor upload connection, I won't be able to seed for long so if you download it try to seed for others, thanks and enjoy!
