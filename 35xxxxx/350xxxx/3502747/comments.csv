What you need to do is load up Azureus, File--->create a torrent, go through the wizard, enter:: http://tpb.tracker.prq.to/announce    in the announce URL box, go though the rest of the wizard and by the end  it should have created a small blue frog file...thats the file you need to upload on here."
