Release Notes:

Pharrell Williams will release his debut solo album, In My Mind, on July 25,
2006. ôNumber One,ö a collaboration with fellow producer-extraordinaire Kanye
West, is Mr. WilliamÆs new single. It follows ôCan I Have It Like That,ö the
albumÆs hugely successful first offering which features Gwen Stefani.

Mr. Williams is perhaps best known as one half of The Neptunes, the virtuosos
whose limitless talents and diverse interests have carried them into virtually
every corner of music. As producers and songwriters, they are responsible for a
number of the last half-decadeÆs most successful and most creative hit songs,
having worked with an impressive spectrum of artists from alternative rock group
No Doubt, to hip-hop superstar Busta Rhymes, to pop icon Justin Timberlake.

PharrellÆs unique ability as singer and emcee is an essential component in a
number of those songsùthink ôFrontinÆ,ö his smash hit with Jay-Z, ôCot Damn,ö
with the Virginia born duo, The Clipse, and ôBeautiful,ö the smooth
collaboration with Snoop Doggùas well as on the NeptunesÆ critically acclaimed
full-length efforts The Neptunes Present...Clones and, in the guise of N.E.R.D.,
In Search Of... a
