,Fryx,2006-10-19T20:51Z,"It's probably something clogging the wire, look if something is standing on the wire, that must be your problem. Or the modem hasn't gotten oil lately."
,tomten7,2006-12-07T15:57Z,how is quality?
,roborabbit,2007-02-14T20:15Z,would be great if someone could seed ;)

,alfa105,2007-05-02T02:03Z,u aint axxo this vid prob virus
,HackerBuB!,2007-09-20T19:50Z,"The quality of the film is good, but the movie itself is REALLY bad. it´s not even good enough to be called a B film. A typical license film =) Not worth watching... But the game is okey ;D"
,Wetbones,2007-09-21T20:37Z,"It's a funny movie with lots of gore and tits during one of the most awkward sex scene I have ever seen. All in all it reminded me of those cheap movies that came out of Italy in the 70ies and 80ies by people like Lenzi, D'Amato, Margheriti and so on. That's actually kind of a complement. The biggest problem with this flick was the script. The whole deal aboz having to find items so you fight the boss at the end was too much like a videogame. How's that for a complaint? By the way, the second movie has a better script but lacks the chesticles and blood. Oh well, maybe the doctor will get it right the third time. "
,sinculo,2008-01-14T03:25Z,The movie actually sucks! No point downloading it...
,CJF-117,2008-02-26T20:02Z,"What the hell? Why is the bottom of the movie all messed up? Whenever you watch it, it has a band of lines that mess around with the bottom of the movie. Its kind of annoying."
,rebellita,2008-03-04T20:34Z,"movie really sucked ass, I hope the game is better, the quality is good, and I like the actors, it could've been way better..."
,Hutlernn,2008-06-07T15:07Z,"this film is gross... And ofcourse, it's made by Uwe Boll - the famous film-from-game maker. Worthless. 0/10, very unentertaining."
,NightRavenRose,2008-10-30T02:56Z,"To mrcobra:

Set your download speed to unlimited or no limit depending on what client you are using.

As for the lack of seeders- you guys should use azureus- that's where the real seeders hide out at-  especially when there are uber popular items out there."
