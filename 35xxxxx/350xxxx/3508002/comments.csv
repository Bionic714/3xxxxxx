,quester317,2006-08-09T23:41Z,Game will not install with too many errors e.g.(sound file missing) Yet checked crc hash with winrar ok.
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2006-08-10T04:08Z,"It installed and runs fine on my computer, and I'm not the one that cracked it nor wrote the info-file.

I d/led this elsewhere and have posted it here with all of the exact same files that I d/led.  I can't huess why it's not working for you.  And I hope it works for others, 'coz it works for me."
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2006-09-02T13:18Z,*I can't guess why...
,Micheal42,2006-12-05T18:43Z,Dammit! I HAVE installed the game and everything..but..WHERE IS THE FUCKIN CRACK?! tell me! >_
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2006-12-07T23:32Z,"The beauty of it is: There is no crack (at least no separate crack certainly).  This package has everything you need already.

I d/led this from the torrents just like you before releasing it here.  It's 100% complete and works 100% on my system as if I bought it from a store.

You don't need an fuckin' extra crack.  If it's a crack, it's already in there, goddammit.  Hope you can get it to work like I did, n00b.  :)"
,Brian Decker,2007-02-01T10:38Z,can some 1 please seed the original dungeon siege 4 me. Stuck at 82.7. thanx. Along with 15 other people. I want to play the first 1 b4 i play part 2
,Mani Katti,2007-02-04T23:08Z,"@Brian Decker
You moron. Read the description. Legends of Aranna CONTAINS the original Dungeon Siege. Besides, I bought it, and I know how it works. You have two shortcuts on your desktop, normal Dungeon Siege and the expansion. Play the normal then the expansion if you don't want to try ""part 2."""
,Menno2,2007-05-28T01:07Z,"> You don't need an fuckin' extra crack. If it's a crack, it's already in there
No? And, why I must insert CD1 when I start the game? There is NOT a crack (NoCD) on that! It's the original Binaries!"
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-06-12T05:49Z,"Yeah, that's why I said ""If"".  You gotta burn the CDs in order to play."
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-10-28T02:19Z,"So like play this online, people!"
,haast,2007-11-09T09:45Z,can i get a bit of seeding please ive left it for the last 4 hours and still aint getting nothing through.....:)
,haast,2007-11-10T12:31Z,can i please get some seeding.......... thanks bro:)
,JakobJakob,2008-02-10T17:49Z,So much anger. Is it not enough to just mount the cds in order to play?
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2008-02-23T05:19Z,"jkchwf327fjkshsa: Are you saying you're too cheap to buy three blank CDs from, like, a store?

Nice!  A ""protip"" from someone with random characters for a name and no torrents.  LMAO!

And I'm no kid at all.  I'd bet my apartment that I was playing video-games before you were so much as an itch in your daddy's pants.

That's it!  I've about had it!  The following will be the last tech-support I'm giving here.  Those that get it to work, enjoy!  Those that don't, sorry--that's just the way the cookie crumbles.

JakobJakob: No, no, you're right.  Mounting the CDs is enough to play AFTER INSTALLATION.  Installing, however, requires burning the CDs, or try the aforementioned crack.

I'm outta here.  Work it out for yourselves.  And play this online--this game needs players."
,agsdfg,2008-05-13T13:53Z,does this support win vista? cuz i downloaded and i can play all exept for internet and zonematch (when i had xp this worked with this dload)
,onimushageek,2008-06-01T15:43Z,i love this game im gonna seed when im done :) peace out dudes!
,danconia,2008-06-11T00:58Z,I'm on Winston's side on this argument (though it happened months ago).  It just sounds like the other n00b has never dealt with a crack before...
,alieninlife,2008-06-25T22:52Z,"If you told me, that i told you, that i was told, what they told you, you told me nothing...

SEE THE MOVIE ZEITGEIST 2007 PLEASE..!!!"

,Pyrobird,2008-09-07T20:33Z,Seed please im stuck at 95%
,Pyrobird,2008-09-07T20:36Z,"Omfg. So this mean, that you'll have to burn the crack ?!"
,Pyrobird,2008-09-07T21:33Z,"Ok.... Now i'll Explain how to do everybody understands! First... When you've downloaded it you'll have to make a new foler on desktop. Then extract the files to the folder you just made ... When you've done so there should be an file called _DS.exe ... Klick it , rest is up  to you .... thanks Winston you're gr8 !"
,mrzhalt,2008-11-12T09:12Z,"For those who dont read trough the facts about this torrent, he wrote "" CD-Recording software or use Daemon tool "" So why not download Daemon tools or alcohol 120% its a software that makes you mount the cds in the computer.. in other words.. read CDs when theyre not in your cd room.so you dont need CD. try google it or pirate bay it. ..
*please seed btw*"

,CrimsonGenesis,2009-10-21T15:12Z,Which CD is the Legends of Aranna ? Guys ! I have the original Dungeon Siege I bought before 6 years.. And I want the LOA Expansion but how do I download the expansion only ? Do I really need to install them all at once ? Is there any LOA Expansion only torrent ? PLEASE HELP ME !
,eugenespurr,2009-12-04T06:02Z,CrimsonGenesis Yeah you do have to download it there is no way to just get expansion u always get the normal with it and why are you complaining.
,eugenespurr,2009-12-08T08:32Z,This didn't work for me when i played it. It just was snow and i couldn't play what should i do
,OscarAlhoII,2011-07-12T11:40Z,doesn't work for win7x64
,OscarAlhoII,2011-07-19T11:13Z,"It does work for win7x64 after all, but you got to run DSVideoConfig and in the video driver select the 3rd option, the one that has your video card and NOT TnL, and then open ""Documents\Dungeon Siege\DungeonSiege.ini"", copy the first line and paste it in ""Documents\Dungeon Siege LOA\DungeonSiege.ini"", in place of its first line. After this you are ready to go."
,OscarAlhoII,2011-07-19T11:15Z,"I also has problems with SmarteSecure, solved by the crack in this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5041322"
