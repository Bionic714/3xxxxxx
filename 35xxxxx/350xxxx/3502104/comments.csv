,Dick Jerkins,2008-01-30T00:01Z,"My Nordic Brother, I join you in seeding Foghat!"
,penit,2008-02-02T17:46Z,"Okey, lets see if I get this right. The idea seems to be; DO NOT UPLOAD, JUST DOWNLOAD. OR?????"
,Dick Jerkins,2008-02-14T22:57Z,"I share...because I care.
I seed...because I got the weed."

Here's my issue; if you are going to upload something that nobody else is going to upload, either by chance or by choice, the best thing you can do is separate the songs, album by album, and PUT IT IN THEIR RESPECTIVE FUCKING FOLDERS. IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

Now, in the case of the Bad Company Discog I happened to comment about on Isohunt (search there to see what i'm talking about), I found a even better one here on Pirate Bay with the legendary beerpal. but that's just not the case with Foghat. If somebody can upload a Foghat Discog AND separate the albums into folders instead of throwing the tracks out there so the people who download it have to separate it, I will be eternally grateful to you. but for right now, this is what we have to deal with. And frankly, it FUCKING SUCKS.

pbumb, i hope you fucking burn in hell for giving us a crap torrent. I hope you're fucking happy, because I'm not."

I agree that it's not the best way to get a collection (i am not going to download) - but shut up dude - I noticed you don't contribute anything to TPB - so a simple THANK YOU to the original poster should be in order - life to short to get fired up about a thing like this  - I actually pity you dude - peace !"
[T],GrandTheftBinary4200,2009-04-06T19:36Z,I agree with KingDubin. I always do the best i can to seperate them. anything worth doing is worth doing well
[T],GrandTheftBinary4200,2009-04-06T19:37Z,but thanks anyway. Foghat rocks
