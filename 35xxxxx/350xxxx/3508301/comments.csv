,darkymac,2006-09-13T10:27Z,"Thanks so much for this ulysses56!
It's something I'd have to import and I really want to audition something more than a silly 30s clip before paying for the cd.

I am only trickling it down using BitTorrent on OS X - where my client tells me I'm the only peer - but I promise to seed it for a month if you keep it up for another 32 hours."
,darkymac,2006-09-13T14:24Z,"Beautiful encoding ulysses56.  And the notes are very welcome too.
Listening right now!
My favourite is the women only with the organ: Maria, Mater gratiae.

Seeding now for as long as others need to share this beautiful file.
