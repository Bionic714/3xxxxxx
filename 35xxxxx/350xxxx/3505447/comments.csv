,Brabancon,2008-05-03T05:27Z,"There is a documentary about the Russian Revolution, search for Russian Revolution part 1 and 2 and you'll find it. It's a dramatised version with lots of real photos in color from the period, and it tells the whole story of the revolution from february 1917 to the Kronstadt rebellion and it's repression by the Bolsheviks in 1921. It is in english and it explains things that are unclear in Oktyabr unless one is not already familiar with the events of the revolution."
