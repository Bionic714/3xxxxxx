[V],VilleR2,2006-07-22T18:38Z,np :) Plz check my other torrents too: http://thepiratebay.org/search.php?q=uploader%3A+viller2
,Son Of Mogh,2006-07-23T02:13Z,Thnx for reseeding this and keeping it alive. In fact I had downloaded it from here some time ago and just finished playing it last week. Next week I am planning to play it again as it was one of the most enjoyable games I played lately. Thnx a lot!
[V],VilleR2,2006-07-23T12:48Z,Np :) Maybe you (and everyone else) could help me seed? My upload is just @ 100kB/s...
[V],VilleR2,2006-07-23T12:49Z,"So don't limit your upspeed - it makes everyone, including you, get lower speeds. "
,joaomarques10,2006-07-24T18:49Z,"please seed´s.
thk"
[V],VilleR2,2006-07-24T20:30Z,"A lot of user are @ 98% now, so once they have passed 100% there will be a lot of seeders. Until that, I'm seeding"
,fredum,2006-07-25T16:50Z,everyone's stuck at 99.4%... keep seeding ^^
[V],VilleR2,2006-07-25T17:03Z,"Yeah I know but, I have some problem with my HD just now, so I dunno... But I'll get it up as fast as I can. Until that, I ask everyone that have got the game (I know there are some who already has downloaded it) keep seeding. "
[V],VilleR2,2006-07-25T17:11Z,"IMPORTANT: Since I'm having some trouble with my HD, its uncertain when I'll be able to seed again... So I recommend you to download this instead: http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3507065 Once again, Sorry"
,Son Of Mogh,2006-07-25T19:35Z,"It's hot as hell overhere and my pc keeps rebooting becoz it's too hot I guess, but anyways, I will try to finish seeding the last bit. Hopefully it will work guys..."
[V],VilleR2,2006-07-25T20:39Z,"THANKS A LOT FOR YOUR HELP :) I lost my copy, so now I'm one of the downloaders too :P"
,BoozE-,2006-07-25T20:58Z,disc 2 is corrupted.

,shinanu,2006-07-26T23:42Z,hello icant instal the game !!?? i have deamontols but its not working pleas help =/
[V],VilleR2,2006-07-27T10:31Z,"For everyone who can't install, try downloading the cd which isn't working again. For example, if the installation can't find the files on cd 2, just download cd 2 again. And if everythings fucked up, just download everything again. That will work for sure. "
,Son Of Mogh,2006-07-27T21:03Z,"Also, important, always do a hash-check after the download is finished. Sometimes your client tells you that you have 100% but after the hashcheck it tells you that you have for example 99,9 %. Than you have to restart your client to finish it again. It will just download the last bit. With bigger files like this I even do 2 hashchecks, just to be safe."
[V],VilleR2,2006-08-01T21:16Z,10 seeders!!
,dragzyer,2006-08-03T15:13Z,"If this is a .rar set, it's a reason there a file called ""something"".sfv This file checks your file, and marks the incomplete ones! SFV checker is the prog."

yeah i got the exact same problem, reason being because the 'sound_3.cab file is on disc 4 and 5  meaning one file has been split into two so sound_3 can't be read properly. is it supposed to be like that because if so then i know its just my software thats messed, please someone let me know ;_; "

Humph. That's to be expected. I downloaded Resident Evil 4 a while back, and it installed and played perfectly, until you get to a warehouse around halfway through the game, and as soon as you enter, the game freezes.

Nevertheless, I will blatantly and hypocritically ignore what I just said and proceed to download this.
Ville, if this doesn't work, I'll hunt you down and throw a Saturn at your head.
Those things fucking hurt."

,T-1884,2008-10-24T20:10Z,"3 problems, in order of importance:

1.  Install process sandboxed gave me a notice on Kaspersky 2009 - worm.p2p.generic in SILENT HILL 3.msi.  (Could have been a false positive, especially since I scanned it with a few other tools and found nothing.  No trace of the worm after install either.)  What's up with this?

2.  How come I get the game telling me ""an error occurred saving system data"" or something like that when I start it up?

3.  This could just be me needing to upgrade my graphics drivers, but I'm getting a solid black box around the menu when I bring it up in-game."

1. Using PowerISO Mount Disk 1 and install using setup

4. Start The Game From The Desktop

,oddPriest,2009-06-05T08:17Z,"I tried running Silent Hill 2 on my laptop, but the game didn't seem to like dual-core for some reason, and it was really slow and choppy.  It crashed once and then gave me an error message saying ""Attempting to run in safe visual settings"" or something along those lines.  When I put it on my desktop (which is single core and more powerful) it worked fine.  

Oddly enough, though, this SH3 torrent installs just fine but gives me the same kind of slowness and menu fuckup that SH2 gave my laptop.  

I'll try reinstalling it.  If that magically fixes it, I'll post again, but if not, I'd like some advice."

,Infinitybla,2010-01-01T21:06Z,Hey does this require a disc install?
,Infinitybla,2010-01-03T15:38Z,"Ok I'm a total noob at this, this is my first time ever downloading a game through a torrent, and I'm really stuck, I already downloaded the game, but I don't know how to install it or whatever.
I already got programs like WinRAR, PowerISO. But I don't know what to do, please some help?"
,kapnmurphy,2010-01-03T19:31Z,"Alright lemme walk ya through this. I had no iso programs on my computer before, and spent 1 hour fiddling around with poweriso before I found a great solution. This should totally work for you.

1. Go to http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads and download the first trial (the advanced trial; I don't think you even need the advanced version for this but you might as well). Install it, and restart your computer.

2. The daemon interface should come up. If it doesn't, simply find the program where you installed it and boot it. On the top row of buttons you should see a green ""play"" symbol. This is the button used for mounting image files. Click it, and then navigate to the directory you have the torrent in. You should see the crack folder and the five mds files. Mount the first mds file (disk one). An autoplay should come up; if it doesn't, open your computer and double click on the g drive. Hit install and the install wizard should begin.

3. Follow the prompts like you would with any other installation. About 1 minute in, it will give you a dialog box that tells you to insert disk 2. Don't click ok or cancel... simply navigate back to the daemon tools interface. Right next to the green mount button we used before, there is a black ""stop"" button for unmounting. Click that button. 

4. Now, you have no virtual disks in your virtual drive. Hit the mount button again and now mount the second mds file (disk two). Navigate back to the installation prompt and click okay. 

5. It will ask for the other disks in time; when the prompt comes up, unmount the current disk, mount the next one, and click okay.

6. At the very end of the installation it will ask you to put in the 1st disk again. Click cancel. It's just asking you to play the game from the first disk, but since we don't have any disks, that's why we have the crack.

7. Navigate back to the torrent folder and open the subfolder: crack. Drag sh3 out onto the desktop. Then find the directory where you installed the game. Default will be in program files ---> konami ---> silent hill 3. Replace that sh3 with the crack sh3 and that's it.

Hope that has helped some of y'all with chu problems. Enjoi.

(2) go down to setup (220kb) double click, and let the installation begin.

(3) when asked to insert the next disk, merely mount the disk 2 mds file and click ok, and do the same for the rest of the disks it asks for. (disk 3 then 4 then 5)

(4) finally re-mount disk 1 when asked and enjoy getting scared shitless :D"

Try executing as administrator. The default folder (C:\Program Files) is read-only for non-elevated programs. (Means: if you don't run it as administrator, the game can't write saves in C:\Program Files). 

I always install games to C:\Games or such, so Vista stops annoying me.

,BZant,2012-05-04T21:40Z,"Someone already mentioned couple pages back some things they experienced that no one else has really talked about. I also wanted to say that every time I open SH3 the screen is black and mentions there was some error and that the save game was corrupt or such. I dont really understand this and know if this is normal? I re-intalled the game again to see what was up and its still there. After pressing any button it disappears and the game starts up though. Havent gotten to play it and save and see if it works yet. My guess is it will. I just wondered about the message.

 Also want to put out that Avast tends to think that the SH3 game is suspicious when you play it and tries to shut it down. Ive checked it multiple times and its clean. So i dont really understand why it mentions that. False check i guess.

And lastly, If anyone complains saying this game is courrupt or whatever since its not playing for them is stupid. Ive downloaded hundreds of games for multiple systems and have been doing so for years. This game worked perfectly. And the Seeders were quite generous. Downloaded in about 5hours i believe. Only tricky thing i noticed was after the 5th disc installs it asks to mount the 1st again and click ok. From there I was puzzled. Just close the SH3 Main page and re open and youll notice it says its installed now. That confused me a bit since I didnt understand why it wanted the 1st Disc. Perhaps its because normally in order to play the game you need to insert the Disc. So without the crack file inserted yet itll ask for Disc 1. 

Overall GREAT torrent, and great game from what i hear. Havent tried Sh3 yet. Cheers"
