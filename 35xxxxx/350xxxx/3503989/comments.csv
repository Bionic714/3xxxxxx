,Lugubrizione,2008-07-06T00:32Z,"Seeding = Sharing file = letting the upload continue after you reach 100%

To find out what your maximum upload is, then set limit to 0 in (most) bittorrent programs, then start sharing / seeding several popular files and see what capacity / bandwidth you can reach. If you have upload of around 100 kB/s, set limit to approx 85kB/s -> 85% of max. This will leave enough room or overhead to give good downloads at the same time. 

If you experience slow or unresponsive Internet (surfing, chat) then limit upload even further, and also limit download to 80-90% of max."
