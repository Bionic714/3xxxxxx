Equinox - It Runs on Water - Overunity (Free Energy Documentary from 1995!)

On Sunday, 17 December 1995, viewers in U.K. saw an hour-long T V. program on channel 4 which, at long last, puts across the clear message that \\\"free energy\\\" is on the way. In the opening stages Arthur C. Clarke explained how there were four stages in the way scientists react to the development of anything of a revolutionary nature. 

\\\"Free energy\\\" was now working its way through these four stages of reaction, which were: a: \\\"It\\\'s nonsense,\\\" b: \\\"It is not important,\\\" c: \\\"I always said it was a good idea,\\\" and d: \\\"I thought of it first.\\\" The scene moved to Rome, Georgia where Jim Griggs of Hydrodynamics, Inc. demonstrated the assembly and operation of a \\\"hydrosonic water pump\\\" which operated over-unity by producing hot water or steam with energy in excess of the electrical energy input to the pump motor.

\\\"Over-unity\\\" was confirmed by satisfied customers, including the Albany Fire Station, where engineers from the \\\"local university\\\" and the \\\"local power company\\\" had been called in to verify the over-100% efficiency.
