This is petsels DS9 S5D3 release.
I'll be unavailable at the beach today and since S5D2 is near completion, I thought it'd be a waste of bandwidth if I just seeded that when other seeds will be available soon. This will be a bit slow for the first hours and will then pick up speed when S5D2 is finished.
