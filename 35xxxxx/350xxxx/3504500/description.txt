This is DS9 S2D1, petsel's release.
I was looking through the Lost Torrents:

This DVD has somehow managed to stay quite active in spite of having been cut off for a few weeks. I won't be seeding this but there were already at  least 2 Seeders and 8 Leechers so if you want this, now's as good a time as ever.

Of the DVDs I have inspected so far, the following of petsel's releases would benefit from a seed:
DS9 S1D1

DS9 S1D5 
http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3312900

All the rest of the S1 torrents are managing well so far.

Remember, I will seed all of these torrents in time, so the whole series will be available sometime. But the more help I get, the faster this will be.

WANTED!
I still need the .torrent file for petsel's release of DS9 S4D5. PM me if you have it.
