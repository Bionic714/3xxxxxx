,woodleeg,2006-07-24T08:31Z,"Hello!  ( and thank you )

The KSEA file has the same problem as it has been on all KSEA files here on TPB...it has a red wall built in that not goes away....what to do ??"
,woodleeg,2006-07-24T08:33Z,soo...it would be nice if the files being tested before the seeding starts !!!......or?
,The_Hangar_18,2006-07-24T08:51Z,"Hi Woodleg,
as i test it, i had this red wall, too. I deinstalled it, reboot, installed again, and the wall was away.
And if you had a problem with reading, plz visit shool again. I had tested all airports on 2 mashines. Want screenshots??"
,The_Hangar_18,2006-07-24T09:18Z,"Maybe, i found the problem with the red wall. Try it without installing the 1.1 patch, and enter a ""real"" long name in the installer box (eg. thomas magnum). Somewhere here the problem must be."
,woodleeg,2006-07-24T11:25Z,"Mr Hangar  18 !!!

I have no problem with reading, but i have a problem with people who has an utitude like you...there is no need to be rude !!!!
...and yes, i can visit shool again, but where is the text that i should have reed before installing?

...and...we have no shool for pc-errors here in Sweden"
,The_Hangar_18,2006-07-24T12:20Z,"The text you are looking for is some inches obouve here in forum. And i dont like flamers. Your first post was really ok, but the second one is to much ...
Woodleg, your are the third ""flamer"" now, after darth tater and belga1, and i decide to stop share any addons, now. Not to forgot NuK`s flame and so.
All my favorite addons here i stil use self.  And my girlfriend use it, too. So we have 2 PCÂ´s, and when its work here, why not @others?
And, when i seed only 1 file, and only 1 other guy got my share working, my upload was an sucess. Because there was 1 guy who i made happy with my work.
I can't hear that flaming any more, so i decide to cancel my already prepared compilations and stop sharing at this time.

All other guys i had to say ""BIG thx"" for all the nice comments and the support."
