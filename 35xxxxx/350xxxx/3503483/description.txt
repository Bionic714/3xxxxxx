FIFA 2004 (FIFA Soccer 2004)

The football game for x86 platform with DirectX 8.1b+.
The game still needs just DirectX 8.1b and this is so great for someone.

It has 7 interface languages:
- English
- Español (Spanish)
- Svenska (Swedish)
- Nederlands (Netherlandish)
- Français (French)
- Deutsch (German)
- Italiano (Italian)

I can play FIFA 2004 with an SiS VGA-On-Board (Acer Notebook: AMD
Sempron 2800+) but badly rendering its menu. A football match still
runs properly.
Is there someone knowing any solutions. Pleazzzz inform me. Thank a lot.

The Setup CDs are not genuine. You need the crack that is already included.
You should use SafeDisc v2.9 Method to write the (spurious) CD2 despite
it is not genuine.

The main gateway of Thailand significantly reduces any international
bittorrent's bandwidth. I apologize for the inconvenience.
