Synopsis

Denzel Washington turns up the heat as a LA private eye in this steamy mystery from executive producers Jonathan Demme and Edward Saxon and director Carl Franklin. Washington stars as Ezekiel "Easy" Rawlins, a decorated war hero who returns home to the segregation of post-war America. Forced to accept an under-the-table job finding a missing socialite, Easy is caught between the white power elite and the vibrant black community of Central Avenue. And as soon as Easy and his trigger-happy friend Mouse (Don Cheadle, in a star-making performance) find the mysterious Daphne Monet (Jennifer Beals), trouble follows.
