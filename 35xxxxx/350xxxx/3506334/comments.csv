,PopArt,2006-07-23T17:40Z,"Seems like fart-tater has a companion lol! 

Instead of spamming us with these meaningless comments, why not vow for a seperate FS2004 section with the webmaster? You happy, we happy ;-)

Untill then, I still believe FS2004 is a pc game and therefor this is the only place to submit our torrents."
,rrodger99,2006-07-23T19:09Z,"I'm gonna help rakmiester out but only if he helps me...


I have all my FS stuff all compressed & it's about 108gb...I need help seeding so rakmiester I want you to be the 1st in....at 40kb/s up it shouldn't take much more than a week or 2 to finish & then you can help me seed."

rrodger: 108GB wow thats a real space! 3 of my HDs you would need for this! :o) (hint - that is also why we cant just pack that FS stuff - /hint)"

FS2004 is NOT a game it is a SIMULATION ;o)
