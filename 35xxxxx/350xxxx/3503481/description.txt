FIFA 2000

A nice old game for any notebook or old x86 platform.

It has 7 interface languages:
- British English
- American English
- Deutsch (German)
- Español (Spanish)
- Svenska (Swedish)
- Nederlands (Netherlandish)
- Português (Brazilian Portuguese)

I cannot play FIFA 2000 with Direct3D (PowerColor Radeon 9600 Pro-Ez).
The solution is to play with "Software Renderering". So if you find the
same problem, open "FIFA 2000 - 3D Setup" and change to "Software
Renderering".

The Setup CD is not genuine. You need the crack that is already included.
You should use SafeDisc v1 Method to write the (spurious) CD despite
it is not genuine.

The main gateway of Thailand significantly reduces any international
bittorrent's bandwidth. I apologize for the inconvenience.
