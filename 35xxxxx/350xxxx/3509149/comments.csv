,gadebetjenten,2007-06-13T16:25Z,"Seems like many people are having a problem...

Now, what you need to do is first, install this torrent.

1. You go and install Daemon Tools, it's a program that makes your computer ""think"" that the specific game cd has been inputted.

2. Now you need to mount the .mds file, that is inside the file that you have downloaded (The Torrent), by doing that, you run Daemon tools, and go to the processline and right-click on the red lightning bolt, and you set all options on @ Emulation. The lightning bolt has become green. Great. Now you rightclick again and go: Virtual CD/DVD-ROM, choose Device [0]: and find the .mds file. The game should start installing.

The Game Directory should be @ C:\Program Files\Eidos\Hitman Blood Money.

The Game Directory will be there after you have installed the game with Daemon Tools.

That's the game directory."

3. You will encounter an error with the file ""M06_Inte.bik"" during the install, ""ignore"" it.

,asdasd1,2008-03-29T03:19Z,"Yeah I wouldnt download this. Im so sick and tired of it. First of it started bad when installing. 
M06_Inte.bik is messed up and you have to ignore the error during the install. Second of all, the game closes in some of the movies. Just turns itself off, no errors, no nothing.

Main reason why Im posting this now is that on the 7th level, ""You better watch out..."", I cant drop anything! If I drop ANYTHING it crashes, yet again with no messages. Drag a body, drop body, CRASH. If I pick up something or just drop the coin, yeah, crash.

Why the hell dont you make SURE the game work FULLY as intended, before uploading? Where's the god damn quality on releases these days? Nothing works as intented, nothing ever installs easy. Like downloading and installing isnt enough, shouldnt the damn game WORK atleast?

And yeah, it's easy to say: ""Well go buy it then! This is free!"" 
Sure, good fucking idea. But then I have to feed the big as corporations who controls the market, that's the whole point of downloading stuff. You dont feed them.

How to:
Get the file hitmanbloodmoney.ini in the folder.
Edit it with Notepad and add: EnableCheats

saving with the original crack works fine too, didn't have any problems except on the snowy place mission. also really nice speed about 500-600kb/s."
,piratexue,2008-07-10T00:42Z,"Ok so can someone please get this straight for me. I just started downloading this. Still at 0.2% but anyway.

I'm seeing a lot of people here saying they've got problems. But there are also some people who said they did not have problems after downloading that DLL file ( http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?d3dx9_27 ) and the 1.2 official patch.

So is this really true? I already downloaded the patch and DLL file so when the game finishes downloading I have everything ready.

I only have 12Gb bandwith and don't want to waste it. I have tried to search for this game on other torrent sites, but I found no good working one, so this is my last chance. Thanks."
,piratexue,2008-07-10T15:47Z,"OK so I downloaded the game in 9 hours, some awesome seeding. I only got one error regarding movie_06. I can watch that on youtube anyway. So to fix that I could delete that file since it's obviously corrupted?"
,s1ls,2008-07-10T18:11Z,"download the missing file here (replace xx and *)
and replace the corrupted file with that one and it will work, was linked in page 10 or something.

,Jatga,2008-07-13T18:56Z,"So I have a problem, it crashes when I try to start mission 6 (what was the name?). Well I know that the problem is that corrupted movie06.bik or something... So I tried downloading it from here ---> hxxp://w*w.megaupload.c*m/de/?d=HLV4UO9O , but it won't work? So How I can fix it? I have 1.2 patch. And YES I PASS the req...."
,Jatga,2008-07-13T21:43Z,Got it. I copied another movie file from movies folder and named it to M06.bik. Couldn't see the movie but could continue the game.
,piratexue,2008-07-14T00:10Z,"mate go to radgametools dot com and get the Blink video program, and install it. This way, you can watch ANY .bik files from your computer without needing to load up the game. This works for any file on your computer which is  a .bik file. It's a shame that you play a level without the movie."
,Ulnitz,2008-07-15T18:38Z,"Okay, i know that it has probally been explained earlier, but my Hitman keeps crashing at mission 7 - The murder of the crows.

now i will be seeding for a wile"
,ylle4life,2008-07-27T23:11Z,"THX!! 

Works perfekt! (AND I AM RUNNING WINDOWS XP SP3)

But you can't set the resolution (keep the default) or else the screen will be black :( 

That's what happend to me..

one thing i don't understand is that he/she who posted this torrent, has written that the file includes deamontools and Hitmanbloodmoney.mds
Hitmanbloodmoney.mdf ( i can't see those files!!) 

But what ever.. they are not needed to play and install the game.. 

I have also updated to v 1.2 (it works perfekt) BUT STILL THE RESOLUTION PROBLEM!!

hope some of you guys could use this to anything :)

(sorry my english)"
,ylle4life,2008-07-28T11:57Z,"okay this is wierd!!

now i can run the game in highest resolution?

i think maybe you will have to run the toturial map in default resolution, but when you have done that you can change it to highest or what ever..

i'm not so sure about this but try some diffrent resolutions and see what happens. if it turns black then change the resolution to default.. "
,ylle4life,2008-07-28T20:31Z,"damn! found other issues..

1) mount the .mdf file and install
2) download patch 1.20 from http://www.softwarepatch.com/games/hitman-bloodmoneydl-security.html
3) copy and replace the application from the crack folder into the folder the game installed.

I also got an error when installing regarding one of the movie files.  I just pressed ignore and it hasn't been an issue yet, though I haven't played through the entire game yet either."

Works beautifully for those wondering.

If you are having the NOT A VALID WIN32 APPLICATION error then make sure you mount the .mdf file and not the .mds.

If you receive an error during installation it is likely a movie file, that you can ignore.

,Planck,2011-05-02T21:03Z,"*****SETUP ERROR********

During the installation, one of the movie files for the 7th Mission is missing or corrupted (according the the error message)

It's actually missing. The file is called (or should be called) M07_Star.bik and should be located in

C:\Program Files (x86)\Eidos\Hitman Blood Money\Movies

On Windows 7 64 bit, or where ever you installed the game.

It is a cutscene file for the seventh mission, and when the game tries to play it, it of course crashes due to the missing file. 

Is anyone else getting this error? 
The file would be easy to locate among forums with users that have the legitimate copy, it would just be a matter of convincing them to do it, hah.

Other than this, a good torrent."
