The Ukrainians play music which is a mix of contemporary Western and traditional Ukrainian styles, reflecting the cultural and ethnic backgrounds of our members. They use electric guitars, mandolins, accordions, violin, electric bass guitar and drums - and sing in Ukrainian!



From their inception in the late 1980s as a side project of The Wedding Present, The Ukrainians have forged a unique path as a rock band singing a mixture of Eastern tradition and Western pop that "blows your trousers off!" (NME).
