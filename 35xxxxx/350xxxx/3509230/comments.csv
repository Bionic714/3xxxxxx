,smeary,2007-11-12T15:28Z,"A junkie will always need his fix. US relies too much on oil, like 25Mbpd out of the global 100Mbpd........that's just crazy. US only gets about 12% of their intake from the Middle East...(8% coming from Saudi) it's nothing. What you must question though is why the US is given a $1 discount off each barrel they buy from Saudis, and why the Saudis have to dig into their social welfare plan to finance $50B in building more oil productivity just to boost the production from 11Mbpd to 12.5Mbpd.......just so the Americans can have their fuel a bit cheaper as the US president needs SOME good news out of the Middle East. The war in Iraq didn't give the US govt any oil, really. For the amount Iraq ouputs (which dropped by a third since Saddam was overthrown) they might as well have invaded Norway! It was the instability they created in the region which lifted the global price of oil which did that. The Saudis needed to get out of a terrible decade which was a losing streak. Now, they are buying weapons from UK and US, and paying them in barrels. Every time a purchase order is sent from Riyadh for more weapons, the fuel price goes up. In effect, they are stuck with that kind of arrangement as they have MANY debts to pay off...."
