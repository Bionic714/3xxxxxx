Has any one got anything?"
,justik,2006-08-26T12:38Z,"As this sucker deletes torrents with bad comments, why don't we just copy-paste the truth about him in ALL his torrents ?
guys, search for tagged ""movie.hard"" torrents, and leave nice comments about this crook !

reminder : all he tries to do is ... selling 1100$ stuff he just downloaded on various trackers/newsgroups, including TPB/KG/demonoid..."
,reichert,2006-08-27T11:23Z,"...none of his torrent are seeded... looks like a scam to sale HDD with his movies on it... and the ""link"" for IMDB leads only to page sales a HDD so the scam is clear!

If any one write a comment, he deletes quickly the torrent, looks he does not want some one to see... "
