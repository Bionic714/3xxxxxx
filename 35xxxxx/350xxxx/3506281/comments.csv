,janek2x,2006-07-23T14:09Z,"there are 3 files, all of them has 4,4 GB, so you can burn it on 3 DVD's. HDTV has wonderfull quality, I really advice you to download it !!! :P"
,altgeeky1,2006-07-25T04:01Z,"I've seen some pretty good HD encodes to 4.3GB, using NeroHD. 

12GB? Too much. (But thanks! I know some people won't nitpick the size).

Heck, for a good enough movie even 9GB fits on a single high density DVD disk."
,Loughtus,2006-07-31T18:24Z,"altgeeky1: 4.3 gb for a HD-movie? That canÂ´t look good, with half the size of a DVD9."
,NewToasted,2006-08-03T21:34Z,Will help seed 24/7 for a week or so if someone helps me get it :)
,Mumpleaser,2006-08-10T22:59Z,What prog can I use to burn the first part onto a normal DVD-R so I can watch it on a DVD player?
,Daddy_Spank,2006-11-18T22:28Z,Some interlacing problems... I cant recommend it even though its 1080p.
,jcharliem,2007-01-17T22:31Z,"nice to see the hd format available.. good news for the hd-business too.. (when will they ever learn?) 

but, what about rezizing this down to, say, like 2gb? the quality would still be pretty amazing, wouldnt it? i mean, 12gb is a bit steep of an amout to download. would take days"
