,julius76,2006-07-16T17:00Z,"I think its the same release, but I will check the movie .ifo before further download."
,jomos352,2006-07-17T14:13Z,"about the previous release, the .nfo said it had english subtitle, but when i finished downloading and opened the movie, it didnt have any english subtitle."
,julius76,2006-07-17T23:03Z,"This is the same bloody release, with no English subs :-(

,poincare,2006-07-21T02:05Z,"Do you mean this does not have English audio?
It says it does."
,ottoniemi,2006-07-22T20:26Z,"It has English audio, but only Dutch and French subs. It's too annoying to have to download it first and then realise no English subs. At least for me, it was a download of 4 G's of rubbish. It doesn't make the net any faster, so people try to put the correct info."
,Insoportable_levedad,2006-09-19T22:28Z,"first, this is not ""southamerica"", it's Chile and its politic process is too diferent to other countries from the same subcontinent.
puede haber elementos similares (algo de historia durante la colonia, el idioma, la economía seudocapitalista, semifeudal) pero el proceso político es único, de aquí deriva su característica principal.
en todo caso, el casting es espectacular."
,Insoportable_levedad,2006-09-19T22:30Z,"anyway, thanks for this torrent, bigsista1957..."

,ufuk84,2007-10-24T19:12Z,"The .nfo on this DVD-Rip is incorrect. The correct info:

Audio............: [X]English 5.1-ch [X] Spanish 2.0-ch
Subtitles........: [X]English    [X]Spanish

No Dutch subtitles, no French subtitles, no extras. Still good quality picture and sound."
,nbarzgar,2008-10-12T15:16Z,"Correct: 
audio and subs=Engl and Spanish, s.a.

Very good quality sound and picture, I love this movie and the original English audio together with original aspect ratio-image is hard to find over here...!
Thank you!"
