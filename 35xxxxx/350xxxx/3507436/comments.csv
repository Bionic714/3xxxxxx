,Freelancer,2006-09-23T01:17Z,When was Live at La'mours recorded? A Google search comes up with no results at all...
,Freelancer,2006-09-23T01:27Z,"Considering what they playing, my guess is it's from 1999. Could someone confirm that?"
,Ramshackle,2006-09-28T19:28Z,"My guess is 1999 or perhaps 2000, going to see if I can find any real proofs =)"
,Ramshackle,2006-09-28T19:41Z,"19/11 - 1999 Is my guess from some heavy googleing =)

And the title should perhaps be Live at L'Amour
