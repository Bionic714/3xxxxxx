,SpockSucks,2006-10-07T09:02Z,"demoz, you my good friend, are a moron."
,djchad818,2007-12-31T08:52Z,I agree.
,badcop666,2008-02-13T08:28Z,"and of course, you think America and Britain are LESS dangerous than N.Korea?! 

I agree with DMOZ, anyone who buys into the mainstream crap about everyone ELSE being the problem has their head up their arse.

America is the empire of evil. Welcome to 21st century fascism"
,nenea_hartia,2008-06-23T20:14Z,"badcop666, I'm from an ex-communist country. Praising N.Korea you are offending me. I don't know about US or UK but here, in Romania, hundred of thousands of nice people were killed in prisons and labor camps only for speaking their mind. I don't see anybody arresting you for your notes above. And check here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3715121/BBC4_-_North_Korea_-_Crossing_The_Line. You'll find out that one romanian woman was kidnaped by north korean agents and died in North Korea without her family to know anything about her fate for 20 long years. It's easy to accuse some country being ""empire of evil"" when you know that will be no repercussions. Do something like that in a country like N.Korea and then we'll speak. Oh, sorry, I forgot. We will never speak again."
,gwonse,2009-01-29T14:31Z,"badcop666,
As a grand child of a woman who escaped North Korea, I tell you..

If you wrote something like that about N.Korea in N.Korea, you would be put away and no one will here about you again. 
In fact, there is a good chance that your whole family will be put away. 

America is not perfect, but not evil. By calling the US evil, you are cheapening the word evil. 
Keep calling the decent evil, soon the true meaning of evil will be distorted."
,ght2000,2009-06-11T02:09Z,"Great documentary.  North Korea is even worse, and more threatening, today than when this documentary was made.  We're not perfect in the West but we have the freedom of choice; freedom to speak out and disagree, without suffering severe repercussions.  Thanks for sharing."
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2011-08-14T16:28Z,"demoz, the proof that what you just said is pure idiocy is the fact that you and your family are permitted to live after saying it.  Say that kind of shit in N. Korea about N. Korea and you and your family would be executed...no questions asked...no trial...it would be automatic.  We can say anything we want about our leaders here without threat of repercussions and that's part of what makes this a great country."
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2011-08-14T16:32Z,"Meh, probably should have directed that at badcop666 as his remark was the more moronic one but both comments were infinitely dumb."
