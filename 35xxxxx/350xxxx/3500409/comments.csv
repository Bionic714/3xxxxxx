--------------------------------------------------------
now. just foget that everything in PC world is Plug & Play. sometimes you've to install or set up something.

START.

1 - Just forget about your Windows Media Player. it's crap. I've tested almost all kind of media players. one of them is reaaly good. and that is VLC media Player. VLC media player is a highly portable multimedia player for various audio and video formats (MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, DivX, mp3, ogg, ...) as well as DVDs, VCDs, and various streaming protocols.
You can DL it from here : (for Windows ) http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html 
for other OP systems , please check the home site : http://www.videolan.org/vlc/


2 - you need some filters or codecs. these work like translator for your PC, Which sysytem shold play how!?
one of these are AC3 filter. it enable your system to play Dolby and DTS sound system.

DL AC3 Filter from here , then install it : 
http://ac3filter.net/index.php?name=Sections&req=viewarticle&artid=5

3 - one of the video formats is Xvid. XviD is an MPEG-4 compatible codec, which produces very good video quality -- something that really competes with DivX. 
DL from here, then install it : http://www.afterdawn.com/software/video_software/codecs_and_filters/xvid.cfm

4 - the most usual, powerful and popular format is Divx.
DL and install it from here : http://www.divx.com/

*** When you have all these codecs and filters, then it doesn't matter which Media player you use. these codecs will be in you PC forever.

that's all for today. any question?

( I'll send this to all aXXo releases )"

I downloaded this great movie, but unfortunately the sound is pretty awful. It's like it's coming from a box. Please help me, what to do! I've got a bunch of codecs and filters. "
,sdbuild1,2007-06-15T02:19Z,"i thought i should comment on this download.i got a nasty e-mail sent to me by my internet provider. my internet provider got a nasty e-mail from nbc studios about my sharing this movie with bit torrent community.
my ip told me if i didn't kiss their ass they would suspend my service.
nbc must have some sort of tracking device on this torrent as no other movies were mentioned.
 as always long live aXXo.

Why can't anyone release this movie right?"
,rumsfeld69,2008-02-21T23:58Z,oh wait--and the fucking audio is 80kbps CBR? This torrent should be nuked.

,suicider785,2008-03-06T18:23Z,"@josh48315: It's to make them smaller in size, besides you don't need the black bars do you :D"
,Persekarva,2008-03-19T00:35Z,Perhaps because it's in widescreen format on the DVD?
,Persekarva,2008-03-19T00:36Z,Source...............: DVD 16:9
,iNJuReD,2008-06-08T07:17Z,"The source is in 16:9 proportion, but the rip not.
16:9=1.77
528:218=2.42 => Is not widesreen!!!

When you play a non widescreen .avi rip on standard Home DVD Player, the image to the right and left are cut. You need add black borders to correct the proportion."
