[V],VilleR2,2006-10-31T12:14Z,Hej! Allt du behöver göra är att låta torrenten ligga kvar i bittorrent-klienten när du har laddat klart. låt bara bli att ta bort den från programmet så ska det seeda så fort du startar det :)
,jucke9,2006-11-01T18:37Z,det står som endrina säger kan du hälpa oss med de Ville??..
,peterjung,2006-11-10T06:06Z,"This works great!  Mario Kart on the PC ah..happy days..memories of mis-spent youth!..

For anyone getting the message ""direct3d failed to initalize yourHAL device 

make sure you have properly configured 3D graphics card compatible with Direct 3D 6.0""

Try lowering your graphics card colour settings i.e.

Right Click on desktop - properties -  settings - Color Quality drop down menu

Lower this to a setting that works.  Got mine working on 16 bit medium quality.

Great torrent big cheers to VilleR2 for posting

U have to download a torrent client. (Like BitTorrent, uTorrent, BitLord etc.)
Then u open the .torrent file u downloaded in the torrent client u have downloaded. Then it should start to download the files. (If u have a router u should open a port for the client)

If u just want to download 2 of the games/roms i recommend u to use uTorrent. There u can pick out the file u want to download or skip yourself.

If u need more help just send me a pm :)"

When I open Project64 and choose Open Rom a window appear saying Project64 has stopped working.
I have Vista do I have to do something different then?

Så jag öppnar Project64 och då jag öppnar Romen så står det bara att Project64 har slutat fungera. Jag har Vista gör det ngt?"

,Decadance_A7X,2009-05-21T13:15Z,"Just run the part file and extract the parts. Use winrar and it will auto apendix the parts. then run the file project 64.exe . if it is an install file then just follow it through. after you can just go on file-open rom then go to the directry where the roms are and click on any one to play :).

hope this helped."
,ParisNara,2009-05-31T21:54Z,project 64 and roms (most roms) work perfect on vista. I play Super Mario 64 3 times over since i got the emulator.

So...the roms+1.6V of Project64=working on vista"
,ismellreefer,2010-03-03T03:18Z,"BTW, thank you very much for the upload VilleR2  : )"
,Ratmanslim,2010-04-26T11:54Z,"Works great on Windows 7 64-bit, but not until you download the latest update for project 64.

Instructions:

1. Unrar all files (winrar)
2. Download Project 64 v 1.6 
http://www.pj64-emu.com/downloads/func-startdown/34/
3. Start Project 64
4. Go to ""file"" -> ""open rom"" and choose your game from the ""Roms"" category downloaded in this torrent.
5. Play!

P.S. you can choose to enhance graphics and custom control, but mouse doesn't work. Some nastalgia to Goldeneye, but mario sucks ass.

The controller is a mess, I remember when I played this as a kid and the great PC-game boom had exploded with great titles such as Quake II and Jedi Knight, games where you used mouse and keyboard combined for the first time.

I hated the controller back then in 1998 and I still hate it. Goldeneye is however playable, but you really want the environments to be a bit more detailed."
,wingless_angel1713,2010-06-06T08:18Z,I can't get them to save can someone please help me. I only want to play the Zelda games but they save in a format I don't know how to get to work. Please assist me.
