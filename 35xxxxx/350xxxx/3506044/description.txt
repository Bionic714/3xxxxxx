Nintendo 64 emulator + 16 FULLY WORKING roms

Emulator that makes it possible to play classic Nintendo 64 games on your computer with improved graphics and easy-to-configure controls on your keyboard or gamepad. There's also a lot of tweaking options and great language support.

The roms included are tested by me and all of them works perfectly, so you dont have to worry about that:

Donkey Kong 64
Excitebike 64
F-Zero X
Golden Eye 007
