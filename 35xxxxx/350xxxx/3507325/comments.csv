,AkQ,2007-07-03T08:30Z,"Why that Player's Handbook is so small? (20mb)

Ive seen it in another torrent
( http + //thepiratebay.org/tor/3423276/Basically_every_D_amp_D_book_released_(3.5)_Dungeons_and_Dragons )
There its almost 65mb! like, three times bigger! Yet it seems to be same version, 3.5? 

Why is that? plx plxplxpxl anssszwer "
,psychosoda,2008-02-10T21:37Z,Is one colored and the other not? 
,silntSpct0r,2008-02-23T11:21Z,The file in here is smaller because of Optical Character Recognition. A process where you convert the scanned images into text to reduce the file size. An added advantage is you can search the text for keywords.
