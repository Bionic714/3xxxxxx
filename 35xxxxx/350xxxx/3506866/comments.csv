,bigwolt,2006-07-24T23:28Z,"By the way all, I have a lot of files that I can seed, if you name them off I will post what I can, I will mostly do 11pm to 4pm (est) seeding. 

Today I will seed until somepoint tonight, so if someone could take over for a bit at 9 pm, I would like to try out some of the stuff I got, but will resume at 11pm ish eastern standard time."

,gusty987,2006-07-25T05:37Z,"hey, I got it downloaded and I installed it, but now I get an error that it could not find a valid license.

If I try to run the .exe in the ""patch"" folder, I get another ""runtime"" error.

Ideas?"
