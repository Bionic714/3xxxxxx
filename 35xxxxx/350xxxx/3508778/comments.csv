,crampmasterflex,2006-07-31T07:21Z,"You're right, my fault; it didn't work because I had the same file in my download folder. 

I will leave it up there for the people who've already started downloading."

,chimi,2006-08-06T18:54Z,"Its true that the earth has gone through and will continue to go through long-term weather cycles, but no or almost no mainstream climitologist believe it.  The only place that reports of man's minor or non-involvement in this process continue to be reported are in the popular press, none in the credible science literature."
,crampmasterflex,2006-08-12T08:35Z,"Here's bush's response when asked if he would watch gore's video:

?New technologies will change how we live and how we drive our cars, which all will have the beneficial effect of improving the environment,? Bush said. ?And in my judgment we need to set aside whether or not greenhouse gases have been caused by mankind or because of natural effects and focus on the technologies that will enable us to live better lives and at the same time protect the environment.?

What are we protecting the enviroment from, if there isn't a problem?!?"
,klassobanieras,2006-08-16T15:41Z,"If the flickering bothers you, try using VLC.
Go to Video->Filters and enable 'Motion Blur'.
Go to Video->Filters->Motion Blur, set it to around 80-90.
Restart VLC.

The movie will be a bit more blurry/streaky, but you won't be in imminent danger of throwing an epileptic fit."
,Scudmeister,2006-09-08T21:15Z,"A cow releases MORE greengases in 1 day then 10 SUV does in 1 day.

Some time ago where I live there was Many km thick ice.
Something must have happened cause there wasn't any SUV driving around back then or big factories.

The earth is not perfectly round and it woubles and the Moon got a huge effect on the planet aswell.
We humans have very little effect on what happens and no matter how hard we try we cant kill this planet.

This planet gone through alot worse things then what we humans can ever do to it.
1 day we will all die.
We aint gonna live on forever the human race will die very soon if you consider how long the planets been here."
[V],Ubet,2006-09-09T03:30Z,"hehe...so lets all speed up the killing of us all=) WooHoo. 
Allmoust the hole scientist community today are saying that we are the ones that makes the globe warm. Only political asskissers are saying we'r not. But when we'r all ded I will not matter. ded Is ded."

,orbited,2006-09-13T11:43Z,"Scudmeister: if you knew only a little about the ecosystem you would know that the emission of CO2 from cows are not dangerous to the environment. However CO2 from SUV's are. How can that be? I would think everybody knew this by now - but apperently not:

Well, because the cow emits carbondioxide that has recently been bound to plants and eaten. Since the mass of plants growing at any particular time is pretty constant, the CO2 will be absorbed by new plants, and not add to global warming.

Oil, however, has been stored for millions of years and the plants cannot absorb the massive amounts of gas and recyle it. Thus, it creates an EXCESS of CO2 in the atmosphere. And that my friend, is global heating.

Do some reading up on the more basic things in science before opening your mouth. Just because you are ignorant does not mean you're right.

This goes for people who are creationists too. Go to university. Just for a semester. "
,piutuityr,2006-10-05T15:32Z,"Just because you're ignorant does't mean you're right... Ha, ha, ha, thats sooo true!
And thanks for the biology basics, Orbited, should be common knowledge by now, right?
When's a better version to be expected, anyone?

,oldngrey,2007-10-17T20:37Z,"This film would make a great prestiage if it would tell you the truth about global warming , it's quick flashing scenes and ill begotten music gave me a sense of forboding and doesn't not help to convey a sense of workable energy alternatives, this film made me feel helpless and depresssed. Much of the film is with Al Gore without anyone really backing up his views , it is like a big ego trip.My conclusion is if you want a pure disaster horror film then this is the one for you, but if you want a unbiased view of global temprature change then look to the bbc horizion documentary about global climate change. the nobelprize has lost all of its meaning and prestige since Al Gore got his. If anyone believes that humans causes global warming is either ignorant or having an agenda. Al Gore does have an agenda, look at his new company which buys and sells carbon credits, instant money for nothing.The ""Greener"" religion just doesn't standup to Scientific facts. Al Gore would sell his mother for a little feel good publicity. Alfred Nobel is probably rolling in his grave over what the Nobel prize has become. The Nobel Peace Prize had lost it prestige long ago when it was given to Arafat, the father of modern terrorism.

The nine alleged errors in the film
# Mr Gore claims that a sea-level rise of up to 20 feet would be caused by melting of either West Antarctica or Greenland ""in the near future"". The judge said: ""This is distinctly alarmist and part of Mr Gore's ""wake-up call"". He agreed that if Greenland melted it would release this amount of water - ""but only after, and over, millennia"".""The Armageddon scenario he predicts, insofar as it suggests that sea level rises of seven metres might occur in the immediate future, is not in line with the scientific consensus.""

# The film claims that low-lying inhabited Pacific atolls ""are being inundated because of anthropogenic global warming"" but the judge ruled there was no evidence of any evacuation having yet happened.

# The documentary speaks of global warming ""shutting down the Ocean Conveyor"" - the process by which the Gulf Stream is carried over the North Atlantic to western Europe. Citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the judge said that it was ""very unlikely"" that the Ocean Conveyor, also known as the Meridional Overturning Circulation, would shut down in the future, though it might slow down.

# Mr Gore claims that two graphs, one plotting a rise in C02 and the other the rise in temperature over a period of 650,000 years, showed ""an exact fit"". The judge said that, although there was general scientific agreement that there was a connection, ""the two graphs do not establish what Mr Gore asserts"".

# Mr Gore says the disappearance of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro was directly attributable to global warming, but the judge ruled that it scientists have not established that the recession of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro is primarily attributable to human-induced climate change.

# The film contends that the drying up of Lake Chad is a prime example of a catastrophic result of global warming but the judge said there was insufficient evidence, and that ""it is apparently considered to be far more likely to result from other factors, such as population increase and over-grazing, and regional climate variability.""

# Mr Gore blames Hurricane Katrina and the consequent devastation in New Orleans on global warming, but the judge ruled there was ""insufficient evidence to show that"".

# Mr Gore cites a scientific study that shows, for the first time, that polar bears were being found after drowning from ""swimming long distances - up to 60 miles - to find the ice"" The judge said: ""The only scientific study that either side before me can find is one which indicates that four polar bears have recently been found drowned because of a storm.""That was not to say there might not in future be drowning-related deaths of bears if the trend of regression of pack ice continued - ""but it plainly does not support Mr Gore's description"".

To Samscad66 : I find it very interesting that the
response is never about the science just personal attacks.
For your information I am a retired College/Engineering Instructor and have never worked for any Petrol firms. "
