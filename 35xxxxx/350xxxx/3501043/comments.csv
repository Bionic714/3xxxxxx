,usudekin,2006-07-05T20:04Z,Very good CAM recording - but there seems to be bits of the film missing i.e. the bit where Superman saves the space shuttle
,z0diac,2006-07-06T03:11Z,that sucks.. too bad there are scenes missing.
,stardst,2006-07-06T10:34Z,"WARNING!!

,XoSkeLLeT,2006-07-07T01:42Z,my opinion is that u should pay to see this... because this one will probably go to history all because its a movie about Superman =) but hey... w8 a minute... w8 till a dvdrip =) Yeah =) haha
,usudekin,2006-07-07T03:09Z,Hey I did not complain I watched it in the cinama quite a few times actually this is a good CAM version but it gets a bit jummpy thats all some one who has never seen it would not know what is going on 
,stevok23,2006-07-07T18:01Z,You could at least tell people there are fucking bits missing!!!!
