,Gothiq1,2007-06-19T12:34Z,"Where is the ""USE no UMD"" option?

,sniglum,2007-11-01T00:31Z,"1. Game is working fine (3.71 M33-2)
2. It's in Japanese
3. Please don't ask questions on how to use your psp here, do it somewhere else where appropriate"
,slamo,2008-01-02T21:39Z,"Tried everything and it doesn't work on CFW 3.71 M33-4 (whether using the ""UMD"" or the ""no UMD"" boot mode)"
,yanhedz,2008-01-03T05:18Z,i'm using 3.71 M33-2 and the game doesnt start. give me a black screen instead. so its nt worth the long wait.
,themagits,2008-04-23T00:57Z,Thanks. Great Upload. it works great but does anyone else get a slowdown about every 7 sec?
,STICH666,2008-06-04T04:46Z,"Flawless. This game runs flawless on my psp Firmware 3.52 M33-4. If people are having trouble running the game then.... when you are at the main dashboard of the psp hit home and a menu should pop up. Under UMD ISO Driver, select the SONY one. This game is great other than it is all in Japanese but even an idiot can make his way around the menu with trial and error in less than 10 minutes. "
