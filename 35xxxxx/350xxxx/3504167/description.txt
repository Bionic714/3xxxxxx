The 'making of ran' ?? A film about Akira Kurosawa ?? A view of Japanese culture through the microcosm of a film set ?? A film about film ?? A film about utopia ??. 
The Sensei sits amidst his crew, calmly, almost invisibly, directing the many sections and mingling hierarchies into the creation of perfection.

A really good film for both fans of Chris Marker, Akira Kurosawa, or the great composer TÃ´ru Takemitsu who scored the film.
