,bessy2k6,2007-10-25T23:33Z,"sometimes files download corrupt for some leechers if u can locate them delete them a recheck your download and it should re download them for u 

another way is to use a program like dvd shrink use it to shrink the file at 100% original and the new file will work :)

nice upload panpa "

,BenTrein,2009-03-30T14:06Z,Got problems too; k3b won't burn because it says it isn't complete. I find it hard to find out which files are corrupt. I'll try with Windoze's Nero later... See if that helps.
,Verbal41,2009-06-02T19:13Z,"Never bothered with following the show on TV, at least not more than the odd show here and there. It still doesn't appeale to me all that much, I don't bother with burning - I watch it on my comp - soo I can't help with anybodys burning problem."

,zSICKNASTYz,2012-06-11T22:33Z,Do I need to burn this to a dvd before I can watch or should I just be able to play files in media player like most torrents?
