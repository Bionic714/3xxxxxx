,Son Of Mogh,2006-07-11T22:08Z,"Hey, this is the worse rts game ever. I remember it took ages to build an army, and if you were done, they would all go to a pub and get drunk. Silly soldiers."

,EFB,2006-12-16T04:25Z,"Hello. I've FINALLY gotten a copy, and I'll leave it seeding for about a week, starting 2006.12.15 19:25Hrs PST.
I can't give it a ton of bandwidth, but it'll be up/available as long as I can give it. If I have to restart the computer, the torrent will auto re-establish as soon as my machine finishes booting, so don't have a coronary. =)"
,Lurest,2007-02-12T21:31Z,"Great upload Zaffo, we need people like u to keep this genre alive:D I hope all voices are included?
I've had all this 3 games b4, but none of them with voices, but i believe that all 3 of them was released with voices. I know for certain that the 3rd was atleast:P"
,vera_matias,2007-02-25T23:35Z,"Hi! I canÂ´t download it. My bittorrent info says "" WARNING : Problem connecting to tracker (http://tpb.tracker.prq.to/announce): ConnectError."" Can you help me, please? Thanx"
,gunnarflax,2007-03-21T17:47Z,Can somebody please give me a tutorial on how to get this running on my pc? i run windows xp on my system
,sarahvdv,2007-11-14T18:59Z,"For those struggling to get these games working:
Try ScummVM. It supports Kyra1 and there are WIP engines for Kyra2 & 3.
The SVN version will load 2 & 3 but gameplay is not guaranteed to work.
Anyway, the latest stable version at time of writing is 0.10.0 and the current SVN release is 0.11.0 SVN. Try 0.10.0 first, then 0.11.0 SVN, but I strongly suggest waiting for the Kyra 2 & 3 engines to be supported before attempting to play them.
I hope this helps!

,kerlmeister,2008-08-21T22:40Z,"Wait. so can someone help me with this file type?
a 7z.....never heard of before.
It wont let me mount it on toast titanium, am I supposed to burn it to a disk and then use it? "
,kerlmeister,2008-08-21T22:44Z,Oh ok nevermind I found out about that 7z. but im on a mac so now im trying to find something to unzip it with
,kerlmeister,2008-08-21T22:56Z,"Well I got everything unpacked, only problem is that all the files on the .iso are exe files. which dont work with mac"
,Frebemo,2008-09-03T07:49Z,"This games can be run on a Mac using ScummVm.
Http://www.scummvm.org"
,Neo67,2008-11-03T12:10Z,"This trilogy works just fine under Windows XP/Vista/Linux/Mac as long as you use the ScummVM engine (http://www.scummvm.org).

For those of you having difficulty with Malcolm's Revenge, all ya gotta do is open the KYRANDIA_3.ISO file using your favourite iso program (daemon tools will do it) and extract the entire MALCOLM directory to a folder on your hard drive (for example c:/malcolm), then copy the westwood.001 file from the iso image and add it to the same folder you just copied MALCOLM into on your hard drive.

Now install ScummVM, click the add game button, point it to the folder you just created on your hard drive (NOTE: You will not see any files listed, just an empty box but that is okay!), click the choose button, select your language and click okay. Job done!

Thanks for upping this torrent, nice to see the old stuff being kept alive..."
,Neo67,2008-11-03T13:43Z,"I just posted an idiots guide at this website:

http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/squirespublishing/kyrandia/

have fun..."
,Neo67,2009-01-10T21:28Z,"Just an update for Mac users, I apologize but I know very little about the Mac. I found this if it is any help:

...If you want to open the files inside it[ISO], you can use the built-in Disk Utility file located in /Applications/Utilities, or if running Mac OS 10.2.X, Disk Copy. These programs should open it just fine, if the file is a good working copy (not corrupted).

Sorry but my lack of Mac knowledge shows up here. Maybe somebody else can chip in here...

Forgot to mention, when you download ScummVM make sure you have the kyra.dat file in the main scummvm directory, you can download it from scummvm.org website in the downloads section."
,rmwag1,2009-03-28T02:24Z,"This Game works and has full voice (for book 3 haven't tried the others). Neo67 is a gun, just follow his idiots guide and you should be fine. A few stumbling points for me that other people may have trouble with:

the file is .7z, which is a zipped file. Just use winrar or 7-zip to unpack it, then follow Neo67's guide. 

Use Daemon tools lite to mount the image. Go t the mount and drive manager in Dameon tools panel, add the ISO and click mount. Now your computer will think the ISO is a CD ROM drive such as F: or G:. Now you can copy the files to your computer.

Make sure you have westwood.001 inside the malcolm folder you copy from the ISO or else scummVm won't pick it up.

Have Fun!"
