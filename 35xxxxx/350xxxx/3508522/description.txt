AnyDVD works in the background to automatically remove the copy
protection of a DVD movie as soon as it's inserted into the drive,
allowing you then to backup the movie using a DVD backup tool such
as CloneDVD and CloneDVD mobile. You can also remove the RPC region
code, thereby making the movie region free and viewableon any DVD
player and with any DVD player software.

AnyDVD is capable of removing unwanted movie features, including
subtitles and prohibition messages such as copyright and FBI
warnings. It also allows you to launch an external application
whenever you insert or remove a disc, or prevent 'PC-friendly'
software from automatically launching when you insert a video DVD.

Decryption is not all that AnyDVD offers. You can control the
drive speed of your DVD drive, allowing you to reduce the noise
level when watching movies on your PC. You can even adjust the
display frequency of your monitor for both NTSC and PAL displays.

But AnyDVD doesn't just stop at DVDs. It also decrypts protected
audio CDs to allow you to copy them.
