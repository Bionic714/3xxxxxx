,amelecan2,2010-03-19T21:16Z,"@ crakeyman,
Buster Keaton is a comedian who developed very good technics and cinematography. If you know Chaplin, think of an equal rival :)"
,wetmouse,2010-10-09T20:56Z,"In fairness to both, he was NOT Chaplin's equal. He wasn't at the time (not by a longshot) and he certainly isn't now.  Nor did Keaton make a single worthwhile movie after The General (which was co-directed by Bruckman) whereas Chaplin certainly did. Chaplin will always occupy a special place with Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton on a lower tier.
But both are also worth watching."
,SURLEWEB,2011-01-11T00:06Z,Excellent choice of films. Good video & audio quality ( for that ime of course). Thanks a lot.
,peterhoover,2012-08-18T21:41Z,"Comparing Chaplin to Keaton is like comparing apples to mangoes.  They both were very talented....but simply put, Chaplin was a far better actor than was Keaton, and Keaton was a far better director than was Chaplin.  Chaplin evidently thought highly of Buster to have him co-star in his 1952 film, Limelight."
