,willski,2006-08-01T14:24Z,PLEASE DON'T USE BITCOMET - Its connect policy is too aggressive causing new torrents to get seeded slower than they should. For this reason I periodically kick and ban all BitComet clients until there are multiple seeders. Please use Azureus if possible ( http://azureus.sourceforge.net ) it is the best!
,brownrl,2006-08-02T10:21Z,"This is a much better version than Pukka. High rating at vcd quality. 8.8/8.7/8.4
"
,zver999,2006-08-03T10:32Z,what about MicroTorrent (uTorrent) then?
,PAX666,2006-08-03T11:41Z,SEED PEOPLE stuck at 95.2 percent
,blubb9343,2006-08-03T12:30Z,"seed status:    1 seen now, plus 0 distributed copies 
peer status:    77 seen now

well, its cuming"
[V],Enthol,2006-08-03T13:36Z,"zver999: willski seems to be advertising Azureus. I've never used it myself since I'm not a fan of Java. As far as I know µtorrent does not seed in the same way as BitComet. However there is no way to learn since µtorrent is closed source. As far as I'm conserned it's a damn good client.

Yes, a seeder would be nice, there are a lot of people that are close to finnished. No hurry though ^^"
,jetso1,2006-08-03T18:35Z,"What´s with the sound? Music ok, voices hardly come through."
,SoundWall,2006-08-03T23:16Z,"Azureus isn't that bad, but uTorrent is better!
Also BitLord is good."
,GlobalClimax,2006-08-04T10:01Z,"Nice Seed Thanks!  Tookk for ever but worth the wait. This seed Pirates is great!  A True TS... 

Anyone know whats up with the Clerks XviDs?  

SUBATOM and LRC(gallies.net)  both stuck in the 90 % for like a week.  

Starting to think they're a scam.

THANKS!"
,willski,2006-08-04T14:45Z,"OK,OK - Use Azureus OR µTorrent !!! µtorrent is a damn good client too - much smaller memory footprint / not java making it lean and fast. But it is closed source and has fewer tweaks and plugins than Azureus.

This release IS the best so far - audio is improved (louder) over the Pukka release but the video comes from the same source. 

Sorry about the wait - I have crappy UK dsl with only 256 upload!

SEED BACK WHAT YOU TAKE - CHEERS!"
,Highlife,2006-08-09T12:23Z,why not seeding????
,ElsaBige,2006-08-14T14:01Z,these files are in .RAR and can't be played in the windows media player or winamp. does anyone know of a media player that is able to play .RAR-files??
,Eleonor,2006-08-14T22:07Z,"Ska den verkligen sluta sådär? Absurt slut och inga eftertexter. :( Man får ju inte veta vad som händer med herr jack, och inte med hjärtat heller.  -.-"
,koro*,2006-08-16T19:51Z,"to ElsaBige:

don't tell me you are able of intalling a good bittorrent client and don't know what .rar stands for!!
it's like a .zip and you'll need winrar (downloadable at www.rarlabs.com) to unpack the files. It's very easy, i tink you can do it ;-)"
,Slider92,2006-08-28T18:22Z,"If im gonna burn it into a DVD, do i just have to burn all those files on the disc and will it then be playable on DVD players?????"
,Nirvalica,2006-09-09T20:19Z,"I only get audio. No video. And I think you need to unzip all the rar files into one AVI file with winrar (you can download it on here...). Then if you want to put it on a dvd, you have to convert it to mpeg. I did all that, and I don't get any video, just audio. Can someone help me out?"
,TeH_PaW,2006-09-13T04:44Z,"well, wated time on teh DANK version, but it wasnt tho whole movie, now teh million dollar q, will i get the whole movie or just another wasted nigth of download......?^^"

,DTF Blitz,2006-10-01T22:46Z,"Danish subs at http://subscene.com/65296/subtitle.aspx

They work 100%"
,F4tal_3rror,2006-10-02T16:28Z,"Just so you all know, the RAR file extention is used by a compression program called ""WinRar""
It can be found here: http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm
It has a trial but you can get around that.
Considering how much i use it, i have to get around to buying a license though."
