   | / | Your probably wondering what makes us do this rls?   | \\ |
   | / | That\'s easy to explain, there\'s simply not been a    | \\ |
   | / | legit release so far. The closest we get to one is   | \\ |
   | / | Pukka\'s internal.. But still that was internal. Then | \\ |
   | / | there was a mislabled \"Telecine\" by Dank = Nuke.     | \\ |
   | / |                                                      | \\ |
   | / | So therefore we decided to fix up our copy and bring | \\ |
   | / | you the first real release of this movie. It\'s not   | \\ |
   | / | mislabled and it\'s NOT Pukka`s source (It is however | \\ |
   | / | also a Russian source as Pukka\'s.) Audio is of course| \\ |
   | / | not stolen either, ours is the best out to date. And | \\ |
   | / | it`s even stereo!! ;) Just thought we\'d clarify these| \\ |
   | / | things before someone starts to bitch about things   | \\ |
   | / | that just ain\'t true. We don\'t steal and we don\'t    | \\ |
   | / | disrespect other grps and there work unless theres a | \\ |
   | / | damn good reason for it. With that said, go enjoy    | \\ |
   |___| this fine release! :)                                |___|
