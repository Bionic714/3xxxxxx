I was just about to spend my money on this as opposed to CS 757.  I knew that this would be release in close proximity to me spending my money on this scenery.  Thank you very much now I can spend my money more wisely."
,b773,2006-07-19T07:26Z,Thanks- Great Scenery - (Req: Ariane 737-900 V2)
,luke97,2006-07-19T07:45Z,"Great!!!! So, I suppose the cracked dll will be valid for all C*ou*9 products, including the updated ones KLAX and Schiphol. 
Tnx very much!!"
,Mr Silver,2006-07-19T08:49Z,"Thanks rrodger99 for this (and that other thing). Mucho appreciated.

...now zorgon34, about your money. You just email me ole buddy and I've got just the thing to help you out...."
,Nitrox_Diver,2006-07-19T09:20Z,"Oh thanx!!!

Is this crack backwards compatible with the other products from the developer?"
,luke97,2006-07-19T09:48Z,"I tested it and is backward compatible. KLAX and Amsterdam, latest versions, worked downloaded directly from C*o*d9.  S!"
,zorgon34,2006-07-19T10:00Z,"Mr. Silver,

I take it you are being serious ? :)  I will land you an email if it should be provided becuase I'd like to know how to get my hands on that 757"

,rrodger99,2006-07-21T07:17Z,"I have done some research on the disappearing gate/floating signs issue...It seems that this scenery doesn't like megascenery mid-atlantic & this is what causes it.

There is an update out but unfortunately it has a new addon manager & will not work with the addon manager file in this post."
