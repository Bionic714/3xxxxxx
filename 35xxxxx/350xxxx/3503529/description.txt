Description: The mutual admiration between actor Jack Nicholson and director Michelangelo Antonioni resulted in the compelling psychological drama The Passenger. Nicholson, in one of his finest performances, plays David Locke, a disillusioned American reporter who is sent on a grueling mission to North Africa. When he stumbles across the body of a dead man in his hotel room, Locke, long desirous of starting life over again, assumes the corpse's identity. He soon discovers that the man he's pretending to be is involved in espionage activities on behalf of a terrorist group. Making the acquaintance of a mysterious woman, he finds a kindred spirit -- a woman as "lost" as he.
