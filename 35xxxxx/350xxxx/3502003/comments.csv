,data pirat,2006-07-10T02:59Z,"rofl if u think this is the best, then u should use google and read... this is the worst antivirus program u can get and it dosent even find anything - get nod32 "
,Magic_shrOOm,2006-07-10T10:21Z,"NOD32 IS THE BEST ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE !!!! ...
Thats it .."
,ruva,2006-07-10T11:05Z,Automatic Internet update t o m 2005 :)
,lebang,2006-07-10T14:33Z,"This is not bad antivirus, it is pretty similar as nod32  :)"
[V],Imgaerion,2006-07-26T22:25Z,"this is a very good antivirus indeed, i've runned this for 2 years now, and have never had an accident with viruses. Shure i have come across some viruses, but norman always finds it at once. Be shure to rund the firewall(wich is included) while it filters a lot of active x controls(hate them i do! ARR!). Those who wants to read a test of the software: http://anti-virus-software-review.toptenreviews.com/norman-review.html"
,SlabbZter,2007-01-01T14:41Z,"Well, you dont need a keygen to this, because it is free to download + free serial."
,MayorSlack,2007-04-08T15:07Z,"the worse.... I have been using Norman for 4 years ligit... and I have NEVER had a prob.
NOD32.... capable of only a fraction of NORMAN
go ahead and take the 2 min to go to NORMAN.com and look at list of infections... same with NOD.
Not even close. NOD is real good, but not the best, and NORMAN is by far not the WORST!"
,ManUnited4Ever,2007-06-21T12:10Z,"I don't find this torrent quite reliable.

I've checked all the other torrentsites, and not one of them have a keygen for Norman.
Could someone who's downloaded this thing confirm it harmless?"
,ManUnited4Ever,2007-06-24T02:25Z,"It won't accept the keys...

This is the best antivirus ever! I tried the trial version once, and it discovered 12 trojans Trend Micro PC-Cillin didn't find! (I'm workin' on a giant keygen collection)

One beatiful day this antivirus will be cracked..."

,djtl123,2007-09-11T16:50Z,"The KeyGen doesn't work..

Please send me and Activation Code..."
,Tommy____,2007-10-14T10:27Z,"Bitdefender says ""Dialer.Genlot.AW"" in the keygen..."
,Hei_på-deg,2008-06-30T23:36Z,"Glad jeg fikk en gratis lisens av Norman Security Suite gjennom Postbanken. Står at lisensen går ut i 2013.
Norman er et glimrende antivirus, bare les tester på nettet der det konkurer mot andre antivirus-programmer, det kommer alltid godt ut."
