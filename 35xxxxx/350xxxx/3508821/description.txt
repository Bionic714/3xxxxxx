PBS Frontline: Karl Rove - The Architect (April 12th 2005)

After surviving one of the roughest presidential elections in modern times, President George W. Bush singled out one member of his team in particular, calling Karl Rove the campaign's "architect." But Rove, a longtime Bush adviser and confidant, is much more than a political guru, he is also the single most powerful - and ambitious - policy adviser in the White House.

In "Karl Rove - The Architect," FRONTLINE┬« and The Washington Post join forces to trace the political history and modus operandi of the controversial figure who has been on the inside of every major political and policy decision of the Bush administration. With the campaign over, Rove has turned his attention to the battle for Bush's legacy on issues like Social Security, taxes and tort reform. But his ultimate goal is something larger.

"I think what they are trying to do is bigger than the Great Society, and approaches the New Deal. They aren't kidding around." Washington Post reporter Thomas Edsall says.

"Karl Rove -- The Architect" traces Rove's biography and political career from his days campaigning for Richard Nixon as the chair of the College Republicans to his recent appointment as deputy chief of staff in charge of coordinating domestic policy, economic policy, national security, and homeland security. Drawing on interviews with most of the major figures in the Bush 2004 campaign, Rove's associates from Texas, Washington power brokers, a Rove biographer, and reporters for The Washington Post, the film examines Rove's plan for the re-election campaign: a "base strategy" that would mobilize Bush's core supporters to turn out in record numbers.

"A close look at Rove's method over the years reveals a dual strategy," says FRONTLINE producer Michael Kirk, "one part in-your-face, eye-gouging politics, and another part translating complex policy into simple-to-understand concepts. Both approaches have nourished a new conservative impulse among voters, an impulse that is being used to change the nature of the American government."
