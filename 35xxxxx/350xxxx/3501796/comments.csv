""Free To Choose速 began as an award winning PBS television series featuring Milton Friedman, Nobel Prize-winning economist. Free To Choose is about freedom, the interrelationship of personal, political and economic freedom.""

Another torrent that I enjoyed very much here on the Pirate Bay is the documentary ""Globalisation is good"" by the Swedish liberal and intellectual Johan Norberg. (http://johannorberg.net) It was made for British channel 4. The torrent can be found here: http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3314851"
