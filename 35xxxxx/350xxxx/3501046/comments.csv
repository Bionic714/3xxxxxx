It'll give you a .rar file to download, extract all of the things out then mount LOTRBFME2.mds in a new CD drive that you can create on daemon tools. Once you've done that everything should all work smoothely."

installation was no prob for me, just mounting with daemon tools, then i copied the crack which is on the .iso. then i copy the fix dvd thing. but the game wont start, it just shows the start pic..."

,Sparda187,2006-08-10T00:12Z,I got the installation working! :) It seems that the .iso got corrupted or something when I unrared it cos I unrared it again and it worked!

How to Install Game
zainium on Sunday, June 25 2006 8:46:14 PM
Programs needed and other stuff.
1. Daemon Tools (Google it)
2. Winrar (Google it)
3. Fully Downloaded Game (Download to My Documents to make things easier for understanding)"
,baadshah,2006-08-11T10:23Z,"
Steps:
1. Download BfME2, Daemon Tools, Winrar.

2. Go to My Documents and open up the Lord of the Rings folder.

3. Double-click on rld-bme2.rar

4. Extract the files to the Desktop for conviniance (wrong spelling)"
,baadshah,2006-08-11T10:26Z,"5. When done extracting there should be an Image File called rld-bme2.iso, then start Daemon Tools by going to start then Programs"
,baadshah,2006-08-11T10:26Z,"6. Look at the bottom right hand of your screen (where you time and volume stuff is. Right click on the red lighting bolt icon.

7. Select ""Virtual CD/DVD-Rom"" then select Device 0: [K:]...then Mount Image.

8. Double-click on rld-bme2.iso (which should be on your desktop)."
,baadshah,2006-08-11T10:26Z,"9. A screen should pop-up saying to select a language, then it should ask you for a CD-Key use one of these:

RLSA-E38Y-CE6D-YCEG-HRLD
WWLL-EH2V-EMP7-5EMZ-BRLD
EMXX-U93U-6BT7-86B5-CRLD"
,baadshah,2006-08-11T10:27Z,"10. Just wait until the download it done (when it asks you where to download just do the default one)

11. After the download is finished, go to My Computer and then select the K drive and click on open.

12. In there you should find a Folder that says ""Crack"", double-click that and you should see to Items in there.

13. Right click on the file that says ""game.dat"" and select copy."
,baadshah,2006-08-11T10:28Z,"14. Now go to My Computer-->C Drive-->Program Files, in there you will find a Folder saying Electronic Arts then select the BME2 Folder.

15. In here paste the ""game.dat"" file...it will ask you if you want to replace another one...and even though the ""game.dat"" file you are pasting into the Folder is a smaller size just do it.

16. Now the game should work, people have been having problems such as computer crashing and freezing and also when their game actually starts their men die in 3 or so minutes then saying they are defeated

the game works perfectly for me though and i have no solutions for the problems other have sorry :(.

but if it works have fun...i enjoy the game very much!!!

GL HF and enjoy!

First unpack the files to a ISO, unmount then the ISO and install the game. You can find the keygenerator in the ""crack"" map on the disc called ""rld-bme2"". When the installation is finished - go back to the crack map on the disc and copy the file called ""game"" and go to the folder where the installation have putted in and copy the file in there and replace.

It is not a winrar problem, my guess is, that your Partition as FAT, and not NTFS, Fat partitions does not support unpacking files larger then 4 gb. So you have to unpack the file on a NTFS partition, then it will unpack correctly, and work :-)"

Well, thx for the solution but how will I be able to change this partition???

Again, it is not winrar there is a problem with !!!

It is the partition on your Harddrive, when you installed windows, you or whomever that did it, chose FAT and not NTFS partition.... 

Too change your Partition to NTFS ...

perform the following steps. 


1. Click Start , click Run, then type command 
2. At the command prompt, type CONVERT [driveletter]: /FS:NTFS 
3. Convert.exe will attempt to convert the partition to NTFS 

CONVERT may present the following error: 

Convert cannot gain exclusive access to the [driveletter]:, so it cannot convert it now. Would you like to schedule it to be converted the next time the system restarts (Y/N)? 

This error will occur if any of the following three conditions exist: 


If you run the CONVERT command while the current directory is on the drive that is to be converted (for example, you type CONVERT F: /FS:NTFS at the F:> prompt). To solve this, either answer ""Yes"" to the prompt and restart the system, or change to a directory on another drive and retype the command 

If an application has a file open on the drive that is to be converted. To solve this, either answer ""Yes"" to the prompt and the drive will be converted the next time the computer is restarted, or close any applications that may be using files on the drive to be converted. Remember that this also applies to users accessing files on the drive over the network. This also includes a page file that resides on the drive. 

If you attempt to convert the partition from which the operating system is running. It is not possible to convert the boot partition while the operating system is running. To convert the boot partition, it will always be necessary to issue the CONVERT command, answer Yes to the prompt, and then restart the computer. The partition will be converted the next time the computer is restarted. As an alternative, it is possible to boot the computer to an installation of Windows on a different partition and convert the partition from that installation of Windows. 


NOTE : Although the chance of corruption or data loss during the conversion from FAT to NTFS is minimal, it is best to perform a full backup of the data on the drive that it is to be converted prior to executing the convert command. It is also recommended to verify the integrity of the backup before proceeding, as well as to run RDISK and update the emergency repair disk (ERD).

Or just format your drive, and choose NTFS when promted to do so !"
,pimovietc,2007-07-02T10:41Z,"mondeo98 thnx again...
But still not comming trough...
When I click the Start Button and Run, and then type command...
when I type at the command prompt:

CONVERT C: /FS:FNTS

I get as respond from my goddamm pc...
The Type filesystem ( srry for the bad translation... I have a Dutch PC... )
is FAT32

It works for the first battle of middle earth, the Second and third. 
When you make the file, be first to load the game you wanna play, and if fails, then do it, cause then the folder will pop up in Application Data called, My Lord of the RIngs Battle for Middle Earth File, and then you put it in. you gotta do this for the battle for middle earth II and expansion, start the game first, get the error, and you can find that file.

I actually already own this game, but Disk 1 is scratched and won't install...

I'm at 85% dl this torrent...  Once I'm finished, and I install the game from this file, can I then just run it with my official disk in the drive?

I don't like mounting drives as certain games won't play if they detect emulators.

Even tho my official disk is scratched, I could still probably just use it as a verification disk once I run this installed torrent, right?"

,zumstar,2010-02-19T14:31Z,"Ok guys listen up I am going to tell you what to do.

Ok so you have downloaded the torrent.

This is EXACTLY what I did.

1) After I downloaded i right clicked on the finished torrent and clicked open containing folder. (I am on windows 7 but all windows operating systems will have a similar phrase

2) Then I double clicked on the very top rld-bme2. You only have to click the top one. You must have winrar for this. If you dont have it download it, get the trial it lasts forever.

3) Once you click this winrar should open and say rld-bme2.iso. Double click this and begin unpacking. (takes a few minuets)

4. Then Double click on autorun. Once this is extracted it will run the installer. When the installer is running enter this serial key
BRU4-T26A-QQGT-4FHS-QGDM. Once that is entered carry on with the installation as you would any other game and then let it all install.

5. Once it has finished downloading do no run the game. If you do it will say insert disc, but nothing bad will happen. Now here is the part everyone gets mixed up at. Go back to winrar where you opened autorun and open the Crack folder.

6. Now right click on game.dat and click extract to specified folder ( i choose desktop because its the easiest to find). Now right click and copy the game.dat. 

7. Find where the game was installed. If on vista on windows 7 you can search battle for middles earth 2 in the search box when you open start. You could also find it in all programs. Anyway once you find it right click and open file location or whatever phrase it is.

8. Now you want to past the game.dat you had just copied. Right click and press paste. There will already be a game.dat file in the folder so you want to copy and replace.
Once you have done that try again to open battle for middle earth and YIPPEEEEE IT WORKS!!

Comment if this works for you. I have done it on mine and my friends computer now and it works both ways. Mine is windows 7 and my friends is vista

Also, for those having issues with the 3 minute death. There are a couple things you can try. 
1: Use the cd-key generator in your crack folder  to generate a different code
2: keep your game unaltered and then update, and download a better patch version from a crack site.

,beals88,2010-03-11T22:07Z,"OK people here's a quick what to do since I jut downloaded it last night and I now have it up and running in 15 minutes ...
1)  Locate the downloaded file.  Most .nfo files you will encounter are usually instructions what to do.  Don't double click the file, right click instead and select open-with ... than choose your internet explorer/firefox ... The instructions here aren't too detailed but you will find 5 different serial numbers ... write two of them down ... 
2)  Go back to the orginal folder and double click rld-bme2.r00 ... it will open with winRAR and you will now see the same file but its an .iso file ... right click and extract to a specific folder ... choose whatever folder that will be easy to find ... the extraction takes 5 -10 minutes ...
3)  Once it is done extracting open Daemon Tools ...  it never actually opens on your screen so right click the daemon tools icon at the bottom right of your window and select mount image ... browse for the .iso folder that you just extracted and click ok ...  Dont worry if it takes a minute mine did ... the screen will pop up and simply click install or it might just bypass that and go directly to a serial entry ... enter one of those serial numbers from before ... it should work mine always does ... it will then install ... once its done it will ask to restart your system click ok ...
4)  Once your computer is back up and running head back to the .iso file you extracted and double click it ... it will open with winRAR and you will see a bunch of files and folders ... highlight the folder crack and extract it to the same folder as your .iso extracted folder ... keep things organized ... now go to the extracted crack folder, double click it and you will see game.dat and rld-bme2.exe ... rld-bme2.exe is a key generator for anyone whos keys arent working ... just double click it and it hit generate and wwaallaaa new key ... for everyone else, right click game.dat and hit copy ...
5)  Go to My Computer - Local Disk (C:) - Program Files - Electronic Arts - The Battle for Middle Earth II ... right click and hit paste ... if you are in the right folder that the game installed to than it will ask you to either cancel or replace another folder with the same name ... select replace ...
6)  You dont need Daemon tools or WinRAR beyond this point ... you can double click the shortcut on your desktop to play ... My computer is slow so when I click the icon it takes almost 2 minutes to actually start the game so do not worry if nothing is happening! dont panic! just wait it out it will start!"
,beals88,2010-03-11T22:08Z,P.S. - The game is great works perfectly for me only 2GB Ram some old processor from 2004 ... just go to setting and change all the graphic options to increase performance ...

,Geekvid,2010-07-29T00:33Z,"In order for the game to load past the splash screen, you will need the Options.ini file to be in your ""My Battle for Middle Earth 2 Files"" Folder. In additiona, you will also need an empty folder called Maps to be in there as well.

To find this folder in Vista you will need to do a search for AppData. Then from there goto Roaming --> My Battle for Middle Earth 2 Files.

You will probably notice it it empty. One person already posted that you should manually create a txt file called Options.ini and add the following

Resolution = 800 600
StaticGameLOD = VeryLow
TimesInGame = 1

I tried this and it did Not solve my problems of crashing at the spalsh screen.

So, I copied the ENTIRE Options.ini file from my working BFME2 XP installation, and copied the entire file into my Vista machine.

So, if you tried this solution, and it did not work for you, try it again with the ENITRE Options.ini contents. Listed here.

""for everyone that has tried everything posted in this thread, but still cant get their game to work, try this. do a search in windows for "".ini"" and look for a file that looks like a text file but with a little gear on it. copy that, paste it in C:\Users\(your user name here) \AppData\Roaming\My Battle for Middle-earth(tm) II Files, rename the .ini file to ""Options"" and delete everything in it and paste all of this in it:

zumstar at 2010-02-19 14:31 CET:
Ok guys listen up I am going to tell you what to do.

Ok so you have downloaded the torrent.

This is EXACTLY what I did.

1) After I downloaded i right clicked on the finished torrent and clicked open containing folder. (I am on windows 7 but all windows operating systems will have a similar phrase

2) Then I double clicked on the very top rld-bme2. You only have to click the top one. You must have winrar for this. If you dont have it download it, get the trial it lasts forever.

3) Once you click this winrar should open and say rld-bme2.iso. Double click this and begin unpacking. (takes a few minuets)

4. Then Double click on autorun. Once this is extracted it will run the installer. When the installer is running enter this serial key
BRU4-T26A-QQGT-4FHS-QGDM. Once that is entered carry on with the installation as you would any other game and then let it all install.

5. Once it has finished downloading do no run the game. If you do it will say insert disc, but nothing bad will happen. Now here is the part everyone gets mixed up at. Go back to winrar where you opened autorun and open the Crack folder.

6. Now right click on game.dat and click extract to specified folder ( i choose desktop because its the easiest to find). Now right click and copy the game.dat. 

7. Find where the game was installed. If on vista on windows 7 you can search battle for middles earth 2 in the search box when you open start. You could also find it in all programs. Anyway once you find it right click and open file location or whatever phrase it is.

8. Now you want to past the game.dat you had just copied. Right click and press paste. There will already be a game.dat file in the folder so you want to copy and replace.
Once you have done that try again to open battle for middle earth and YIPPEEEEE IT WORKS!!

Comment if this works for you. I have done it on mine and my friends computer now and it works both ways. Mine is windows 7 and my friends is vista"

,chaotic82,2011-01-14T10:39Z,"OMG xXCireEricXx did you really just ask what to do with the zip files?  Hmph.  Look, what you need to do is download a tool like 7z, peazip or IZArc to unpack the files.  Except for this on there is only one file that you need to unpack: rld-bme2.rar, in which case I would go with IZArc.  Knowing torrents with the ""RELOADED"" tag on them we can expect that the file inside is a ISO which we will MOUNT with Deamon Tool lite.  Did I mention that both Deamon Tools lite and IZArc are free ware?  No?  Well now I did.  Follow the install wizard.  Once installed copy the contents of the crack folder to the game dir.  I haven't dled yet but I will here in a min.  The Crack folder should be in the ISO which can be explored.  If you can't find any of this stuff then you have no business on a PC at all, and that goes for anyone else.  Sure we were all noobs once, but I figured it out on my own by reading all the comments and searching the web.  All the info is out there it's that these ppl are lazy or just stupid...

I see some of the same dumbass's asking the same questions on different torrents.  What drives me bonkers is that most of the time the uploader includes a .nfo or a readme on how to install it or includes that info in the description box for the torrent.  Then someone asks how to install the game.  Someone nicely tells them and then 40 other fuk sticks repeat the exact same Q with the exact some problem which could have been solved had they just read a little.  So it's not about being a ""noob"", it's about being a lazy piece of shit.  get off the couch and go for a jog..."

We took care of it by reading the comments and finguring out what the problem was... but now we have yet another problem...

We are trying to play LAN over our home network, and oddly, whenever we get to the lobby, he can see me and what I type, but I can't see him or what he types.

I've read all of these comments, and It was hell to get the game installed and working, so we don't want to reinstall the game. 

Is the problem really because our versions are different?
--If that's the case, you should know that every time we open the game, on either computer, when we check in the settings menu for our version, it's different every time the game re-opens.
----So he was wondering if we should keep reopening the game on each computer untill we both got the same version number.
 I wasn't too sure about that.. but anyway, I got both the games patched up to version 1.06, and cracked properly via gamecopyworld.com and I'm really just stumped.

I've gotten many torrent games and movies and I know what I'm doing, but this has just got me stumped. I've never had a problem setting up a LAN game between me and my brothers computers until this game.. What should I do?

Just so you know, I am running Windows Vista (x64 bit) and he is running Windows 7 (x84 bit). So he says... I'm not sure if he is running (x84 bit) but he says he's ""pretty sure""... So...

If so, that would help bundles. Does replacing the game.dat file make me le my game data? if it does or doesn't, that would still be apreciated. You can send it to me here:

,Millor1,2011-07-30T09:29Z,"If you don't know how to install this...

1. Once you download it, take 1 of the rar files (I don't think it matters) and just right click and do extract here with winrar
2. once its done extracting, open daemon tools and navigate to the .iso extracting makes.
3. double click on the disk to start installation, when it asks for the CD key, go to the drive the disk is mounted in and right click and hit open and find the folder named ""crack"" click on the application (not the .dat file) and generate the CD key with that and use it.
4. Once installed, copy the .dat file in the crack folder into the game directory. the one with the main game application, if you put it in the right folder, it will ask you to overwrite the other file, click yes.

For multiplayer download GameRanger and you can usually find some games going on there... but don't get your hopes to high because its using their connection and it will lag more depending on how far away they are or how bad their internet is."

,Sivos,2011-08-23T03:44Z,"@nowoka1na The kids are getting dumber.  That's not even opinion, just proven fact.  The IQ chart actually dropped rapidly since 1998 and is still dropping.  I think they are just mainly at a lost of common sense, take Purkkaleiri for example (see above comments from him/her).  Even if they were new to torrents, they could have just simply Googled it like a lot of people do, like I did even when I first started.  There are countless YouTube videos on how to install a lot of torrents, even one on how to install a RELOADED torrent.  Sadly no, they just decided to show their idiocy by insulting the torrent."

this games servers were shut down by EA(bastards)

BUT you can still play multiplayer, even with pirated version.

Just download game _ ranger, (no spaces or underscrore, one word) (works with other torrentgames too!)

just go to the website game _ ranger, (no spaces or underscrore, one word) and.

then patch your game to latest version(1.06)!, get and run the exe from filefront or anywhere.

1.06 vers dont forget.

Alot of players using it ANY time of day, THE best multiplayer RTS.

very fun multiplayer"
