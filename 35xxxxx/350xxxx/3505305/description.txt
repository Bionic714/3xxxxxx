From a secret love affair between no other than Roky Ericson and Dolly 
Parton came to birth the Girl from Saskatoon one rainy winternight in 
2002. Born with a guitar in hand, love in her heart, and her hair gently 
coloured with a pleasant mix of Rock & Western.

It has been written that the Girl from Saskatoon sounds like if The 
Shags rises again as punked-up cowboys, both sweet and sour at the same 
time. And quite perfect for the memory of the Man in Black himself, mr 
Johnny Cash who wrote that song from where they picked up their name, a 
beautifull tune dedicated to Joni Mitchell.
