Steam is hard to get around, If yo try and rn a pirated copy of HL2 it disables the AI. And you eventually cant continue the game.

I wouldn't download this if I were you. 

And anyway, Half Life 2 is probably the best game ive ever played, so go and buy a legal, full workign version. Its worth it!

www.play.com, you can get it there for like... £17 or something.

hint 3: Half-Life 2 is amazing, and absolutely no defects have been found yet, GET THIS, its worth waiting the 2 and half weeks to download....well for you people that are having trouble, i havent ANY encouters with steam, or ANY errors, or ANY virsus, this thing, is 5/5 stars"
,Silent-Kill1191,2007-03-24T06:49Z,"heres some information STRAIGHT from the ""readme"" explaining how to update css/hl2

- Official Steam updates may be applied to Half Life 2 and
  Counter Strike Source if you have access to the cached GCF
  files from a valid Half Life 2/Counter Strike Source
  account. These may be found in the ..\Steam\SteamApps\
  directory. By replacing the GCF files found there with
  the GCF files in this installer (GCF files found in CSS
  and HL2 directories) the latest official updates may be
  obtained. Once replaced, just run ""HL2 Install-Update.bat""
  and ""CSS Install-Update.bat"" to apply updates."

Download all the files. (The mods to, or altleast the make_mod.bat file)
Install HL2 and CS: S as is says in the readme.

,sloppydave,2007-11-06T05:32Z,"please, i am now BEGGING someone to help me out on installing this game, I've read through all the comments and I think that I'm doing everything right but I just don't know what it is, I would greatly appreciate it if someone who has correctly gotten this to work would lend me a hand on maybe another step by step guide that might just help disprove what I am doing wrong.
THANK YOU SO MUCH"
,omgwtfpiratebay,2007-11-26T14:10Z,"Wow, what a bunch of fucking n00bs. I installed/played this game in a matter of minutes. All of you that don't have a fucking clue what you're doing, you probably shouldn't be downloading or trying to install this. Go back to wherever you purchased your computer and giv it back to them. When they ask why you're returning it repeat the following: ""I am too stupid to own a computer."" Although, most of you are probably fucking n00bs that are using mommy & daddy's PC."

,PMANRULED,2008-05-14T13:46Z,"Hey guys, i report that this game works perfectly on my computer. anyone know how to limit the frame rate? The frame rate keeps going above 70, and its making choppy lines, because its above my refresh rate. Anyways, just do exactly what the HL2+CSS+DODS+DM+LC+MS2.nfo file tells you to. (by the way, if u dont know how to use a .nfo file, right click, and use with microsoft word, or notepad.) extract the .rar file, and double-click HL2 Install-Update. it will take about 20-30 minutes to install, and once its dont, it will place a file called play_HL2 on your desktop. open that, and half life 2 will start. I have beat this, episode 1, and 2 , and now im patiently waiting for episode 3. Whoever made this torrent, i need to tell you, there is nothing wrong with it, the people who posted those other comments obviously haven't used torrents that much... and by the way, OMGWTFPIRATEBAY, who posted a comment on the 6th page, i agree with you 100%."

If they can't use torrents for shit, then try to help them instead of being a snobby bitch."

,Neo187,2009-01-10T02:58Z,"For Windows Vista users! Should you get the: ""Could not find the GCFs folder. System has not been modified"" error message, here is how you get around it (thank you very much Marajah!):

1. Copy the ""Unpack.exe"" file to X:\Windows\System32

2. Edit the ""HL2 Install-Update.bat"" file (right click and ""edit"" or simply open it with Notepad):

- After u have opened the edit window, get to the 2nd paragraph and read the instructions. Follow them by typing or pasting the location of the ""HL2"" folder that you unzipped from the .rar file youn downloaded. MAKE SURE to include the \HL2 in the end of the location, example ""C:\User\Desktop\HL"" if the file with the source is on your desktop.
- On Vista 32 the you won't be able to install the game in the Program Files default location, or at least I wasn't, so in the same ""HL2 Install-Update.bat"" file, edit the install directory in the very fisrt paragraph to something else, I used a ""New Folder"" on my desktop. Follow the instructions in that paragraph to modify the directory.

3. Now run ""HL2 Install-Update.bat"". It should work properly now.

4. Go grab some coffe. It takes a lot of time to extract everything... (About 20 minutes)

5. Do the same to ""CSS Install-Update.bat"" for CSS, using the proper directory and be happy. 

Games works like a charm."
,maverin2,2009-01-20T00:38Z,"when i start it it loads the main menu then exits and says ""Module failed to initialize"" anyone know how to fix this?"

,MarshunMartin,2009-06-10T19:01Z,I installed it and ran play_HL2.bat; it all worked great (the Valve opening the guy with a valve in his eye socket played) until HL2 closed with the engine error: Half-Life 2 is required to run mods. :-/

,bryk,2010-03-29T20:09Z,"What a frustrating waste of time this has been. Is this for users WITH STEAM or is this a NON-STEAM  version?! I mean I followed all the instructions in the Info file and the Mods readme but the shortcuts didn't work,nothing worked. The Readme suggests the steamemu.ini file in the \root directory should contain lines upon lines of info,yet there is nothing except this in there: [Emulator] Extracted=1


What a f*cking annoying experience. I've wasted a good six hours trying to get it to work,uninstalling everything and then trying again-but no,it won't work. And no,I'm not a stupid noob that doesn't know I have to have HL2 installed-I finished the game yesterday(and held back from installing Episode One because I was stuck up in downloading and installing this f*ck up)"
,sqrtman,2010-05-27T02:30Z,"ok... I downloaded and unpacked this.
I am trying to run the HL2 install, but when i run it the cmd appears and tells me ""press any key to continue"", i do.
then it does some stuff and then pops up with a bunch of errors. It then asks me if ""C:/Program Files/Half Life 2/root"" is a filename or a directory name?

I have never seen this in an install before.
Does anyone else have this problem?"
,sqrtman,2010-05-27T02:34Z,"It then asks the same question about some other files, then dissapears.
I have the link on desktop but it does nothing?"

,Taskelis,2011-12-31T23:01Z,I think it is good  how i can seed?
,toast69,2012-04-21T16:40Z,"Hey guys, I've been noticing a lot of people having trouble with this. I'm using Windows 7 and this is how I did it. 
Step 1: Open Half Life 2 + CSS file in winRAR
Step 2: Run the unpack.exe (it might just run and disappear right away but I guess it's supposed to?)
Step 3: Extract all the files to the desktop
Step 4: Open that file and run the Half Life 2 installation FIRST. 
Step 5: play a different pc game you have installed already while you wait because it will take about a half an hour to install."
