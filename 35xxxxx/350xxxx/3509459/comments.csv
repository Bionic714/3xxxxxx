,AlternateView,2008-08-21T17:13Z,"Amazing torrent, works like a charm. I used DaemonTools to mount the mini IMG and then loaded that virtual drive through eSPXe.

Will seed at whatever speed I can give, more people need this excellent torrent.

No sound on FMV sequences but that's really a minor issue."

,Donslayer,2010-08-11T14:46Z,"Run the file in Deamon tools, then press on runcdrom in the ePSXe emulator, easy said. IF it dosent work, make sure that ePSXe is reading the rigt cdROM. Look it up at Config - cdROM - COnfiguration . Find the CD rom ur mounting Tombi.mdf with.

BTW, WOrks perfectly, Thank you so much :)"
