""Be stiff b-abies be stiff
Fruit ooze is wetly lewd
Stay dry in rubber boots and-be stiff, oh baby be stiff
Cucumbers ripe and rude
Bend over fixed to shoot and
Breath hard in metal suits
Live right make lots of loot- be stiff, oh baby be stiff
Wet women waste your food
Go solo no no twos and-be stiff, oh baby be stiff
Deep sleepers jerk the root
Watch out for fruits and mutes and -be stiff, oh baby be stiff""
