,Buset,2006-08-13T14:25Z,"Tackar, har en HP iPAQ hw6515, det funkar klockrent, fick även in svenska menyer och ljud.. "
,rimbim,2006-08-19T21:02Z,"Eat my words - it does look like a good prog - some much better features than TT5 - however:
it runs out of memory v. quickly (IPAQ 4700) and freezes.
It cannot use speed camera POIs imported. Makes it useless for me!
This crack will not allow the Greece summer update - this needs a s/no.
Worth playing with to see what it will develop into.
just copy the folders into the root of a card, insert into the PDA and it auto installs. Then read the crack instructions.
The English voice cannot handle miles/yds. kms only."
,cyclerace,2006-08-23T19:42Z,"when i downloaded the summer update from their official website i installed everything as said. at the end of the whole computer proces(... writing card-finishing...) i opened up iGo on my PPC as it is said. but at first it says ""hardware id changed"" and i have to write in a S/N or somekind of a licence. so i was wondering if anyone else had any problems like this and how did you solve them, cause the program is realy great, but without updates :(. or if anyone has that S/N or license number? thx"
,teetee,2006-08-25T15:17Z,"copied everything to memory card, when trying to install I get message ""Installation is aborted. License is not found. Error code : 0021."" I have WM5, i-mate K-jam. Can anyone help? "
