,svendk,2007-03-19T00:12Z,"... and - I wouldn't say, that a rip in the unstandard size of 1.07 GB would be proper..."
,joaojoaquim,2007-04-12T07:47Z,"this one is a good rip...you can download it, you won't regret it"
,BurgerDude,2007-08-11T16:05Z,This movie is superb!
,mjosha,2007-09-21T02:46Z,"Sorry to say this but this must be one of the worst rips i've ever seen. Bits of the movie where just gone. Perhaps it got damaged when i downloaded it. 
Anyhow, i personally wouldnt recommend this version."
