,Goethemola!,2006-07-20T12:33Z,Usually I create an image with Dvdshrink and then  I burn it with DvdDecrypter.
,Rangifer2,2006-07-20T14:29Z,"Thanks...I usualy use dvd shrink as well but couldnt get it to work first...but I managed to get it to work when I transformed it in to a imagefile and then burn it with nero.
(dvd decrypt and alcohol 120% didn't work for some reason)

Thanks for a great movie :-)"
