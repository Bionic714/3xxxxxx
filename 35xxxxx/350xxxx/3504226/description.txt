Recorded at Vagern Records Studios and mastered by Ron Boots.
All tracks composed, recorded and played by John Lakveet. 

In his second solo album, John Lakveet has succeeded in creating an epic symphony, intense, full of warmth, beauty, stormy atmospheres, and also mystery.
With a first hearing the listener already perceives the effort there are behind this project. In successive hearings, the range of this CD appears in all its greatness. The music is impetuous, risky, able to evoke situations where the emotions are given a free run and adrenaline floods all our entire being. The dramatic melodies and strong sequences that appear in certain passages, provide some of the compositions with an apocalyptic atmosphere. 
This album takes us towards the unknown eras of yesterday, but also towards the unknown tomorrow.  It's retro New Age music.
In short, this is a magnificent album, which no doubt will contribute to increasing the reputation of this artist.
