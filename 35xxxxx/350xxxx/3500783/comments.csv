,Mr.Teslacoil,2006-07-05T00:01Z,"Good jobb for putting this up, unfortunally itÂ´s an assclown copy, there i a gap where the film has a huge leap, and probably a key scene is cut out.."
,stevok23,2006-07-05T18:25Z,"Thanks for putting this up but you really shouldn't have bothered, video ok but the sound is real bad!  Probably had his cam hidden in popcorn! :)"
,stardst,2006-07-06T10:37Z,"WARNING!!
