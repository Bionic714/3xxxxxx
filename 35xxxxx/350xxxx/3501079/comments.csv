,xmagixx,2008-12-07T21:23Z,"FFS 
DONT DOWNLOAD IT !
It's not the 2008 The day the earth stood still
but the one from 1951
NO KEANU IN THIS ONE"
,vlindsio,2008-12-08T16:16Z,"xmagixx, its not stated that it is the 2008 version...
It has the original cast mentioned and it was uploaded in 2006.... so why would he have to say its the 1951 version...? considering the 2008 version has only had trailers and stuff released late this year...

"

,Viruses_are_the_governmen,2008-12-10T16:22Z,You tweenies look at the upload date 2006-07-05 19:57:39 bit obvious

,marcus_mark,2008-12-13T17:42Z,Thanks for the upload but sadly to say that I deleted it str8 away once I knew it was an old film. It might a good film but I am one who is just into new films.
,thEdUdeSWE,2008-12-14T16:36Z,You would think that the info regarding that this is the oooold movie would be something to put out there.... Compare! Thanx for the upload any ways. Happy xmas all!

,SystemFolder,2008-12-15T05:34Z,"Why don't people read before they download the torrent file. In the title it says, ""DVD"" and the 2008 version isn't even in the theaters yet, so it can't be the 2008 version. Also, in the cast, up above, there's no mention of Kenneau Reeves, so no duh this isn't the 2008 version. It's the better one that inspired the remake. Never forget that originals are almost always better than remakes. One of the obvious exceptions to this rule is Scarface, but that's one of a select few exceptions."
,pc39707,2008-12-15T16:16Z,Great audio and video quality! Thanks for the upload!

Peck,
Can you please be more specific about how you suggest to convert from Pal to NTSC other than to put all settings on high? Which particular settings? I have been reading forum after forum and have yet to find a way to convert from PAL to NTSC . I have this tool already which works very well but still have not been able to convert a PAL dvd to NTSC . Thank you."
,RedMelon,2008-12-23T13:30Z,"ok...thanks to peck, i found a link on the convert forums. here it is. it explains how to convert. thanks a bunch!
