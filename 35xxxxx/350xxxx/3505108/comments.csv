,Mirbacher88,2006-09-05T21:46Z,"I don't get the sound to work. I've burned the VIDEO_TS file on a DVD but when I run it their is picture but no sound, What am I missing??????"
,Mirbacher88,2006-09-05T22:24Z,"Yes, I got it to work, must've been something wrong with the DVD I was using. Great quality and a great Nirvana-performance. I've seen better (this one is more of a live rehershal) but it's still so extremely good that it gets 5/5. NIrvana is the best band ever and this DVD makes me think even higher about the legendary band."

For you noobies out there...Nero is one of the very few programs out there that will let you rebuild a DVD like this. 

Thanks again fuzzgun!"
