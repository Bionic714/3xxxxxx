You mentioned earlier that you use bitcomet, and I think a lot of people ban it for being a cheater client.  I haven't to my knowlege but it may be worth it to try something else."

This torrent is working. It's now
a bit less than 24 hours since I
started this torrent and I have
uploaded 10% of the file so far.
At that rate it will be several days
before the first leecher gets the
whole file.

I'm not sure why it's not working
for you. Perhaps try again in a few
days. Good luck and thanks for the
feedback.

Once you get the whole file let me
remind you to stay connected until
your upload/download ratio reaches
1.1 or more. Thanks."
