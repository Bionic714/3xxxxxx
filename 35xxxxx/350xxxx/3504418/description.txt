Here it is again. It was removed during the time Pirate Bay was down.

I'm too lazy to write a description again. Just fucking google it, alright? :P Or check here: www.bobhund.com

Basicly it's an album released freely on bob hund's official website (because there are so few real copies anyway). I downloaded the WAV version and compressed it to flac (a free lossless audio codec which doesn't remove audio during compression, compared to e.g. OGG and MP3). I share it here to make downloading faster for everyone (and now bobhund.com doesn't need to pay as much for their bandwidth anymore ;D ).

Information on how to decompress flac is here: flac.sourceforge.net
