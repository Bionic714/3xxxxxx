A young man tries to make sense of his conflicting emotions concerning love and sex in this coming-of-age drama from South Korea. Ja-hyo (Kim Rae-weon) is a student in his last year at high school who attracts the eye of a girl named Ha-ra (Yun Ji-hye). Ha-ra throws herself at Ja-hyo, but he is unable to return her love after they've slept together. Ha-ra falls into a deep depression and commits suicide; shocked and saddened, Ja-hyo finds himself unable to commit to a relationship with a member of the opposite sex. He becomes involved with Nam-ok (Bae Du-na), an older woman working as a nurse, but while Ja-hyo isn't sure if he's ready for a long-term relationship, Man-ok isn't about to let him get away from her. Meanwhile, Ja-hyo's best friend Su-in (Kim Jeong-hyeon) has romantic problems of his own -- he's fallen in love with his teacher, Jeong-hye (Jin Heui-kyeong).
