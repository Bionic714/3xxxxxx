[T],480v,2009-12-17T02:56Z,"People, a word of advice... if you are the ONLY seeder...PLEASE Turn on ""Initial Seeding"" or ""Super Seeding"" for that particular torrent (Don't turn it on if there's two seeders). Parts of the file will be passed around a lot quicker within the swarm if you do. This one seeder obviously doesn't have Initial seeding on. So he is basically re-uploading the same part of file to every single leecher. Which is taking forever. Every leecher has the same file % completed. VERy inefficient. With Initial Seed turned on uploaded parts would be reseeded by the leechers for him."
[T],480v,2009-12-17T03:07Z,So when 'Initial seeding' is NOT turned on then when a new leecher joins the the swarm all the attention goes to him until he catches up to the same % as the rest of the stuck waiting swarm. So PLEASE turn on Initial seeding IF you are the ONLY seeder. Again this way the seeder doesn't have to upload the same goddamn part over and over again. that part would be uploaded once then shared between the leechers..UNDERSTAND!!!
