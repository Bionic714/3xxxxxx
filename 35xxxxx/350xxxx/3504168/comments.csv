,raptor550,2007-12-24T21:51Z,"Seriously, wtf is this bullshit file?  And yes, I have the K-Lite codecs and VLC."
,raptor550,2008-01-26T05:09Z,"For future reference, the *.ts files play with Nero ShowTime, which actually isn't that bad.  Are there any other players that play these?  And btw, the quality is very worth the download."
