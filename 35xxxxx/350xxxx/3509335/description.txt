Alex Jones welcomes Greg Palast live in studio to discuss high crimes and misdemeanors of the corporate elite as exposed in Palast's new bestselling book Armed Madhouse: "Who's Afraid of Osama Wolf?", China Floats, Bush Sinks, The Scheme to Steal '08,No Child's Behind Left, and Other Dispatches from the Front Lines of the Class War.

Palast covers the pre-9/11 plans to formulate policies for controlling Iraq's oil fields and the cover-up surrounding them, the deliberate plan to engender chaos in Iraq, the state of journalism in America, and the slow slide to soft dictatorship.

Palast's analysis of the peak oil scam decimates the claims of those who say black gold is on its way out of existence and it should be regulated by oil companies who in their own documents have been caught creating artificial scarcity. The role of Venezuela and Hugo Chavez in oil politics is also covered.
