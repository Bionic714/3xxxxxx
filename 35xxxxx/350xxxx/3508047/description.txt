Originally released in 1977, Body Love is Schulze┬┤s first soundtrack. The 
famous pornography director, Lasse Braun, asked him to compose an original 
soundtrack to his movie by the same name. Schulze had great success overseas, 
and in 1977 the album became # 2 in the USA Billboard import charts. Klaus 
Schulze first attracted attention as a member of the German progressive rock 
band, Tangerine Dream. Following the release of their debut LP, Electronic 
Meditation, he departed for a solo career. Klaus' recorded work typically 
features extended pieces sometimes filling an entire album built around 
computer-generated synthesizers and other specially programmed electronic 
effects. Klaus Schulze remains a cult figure in the United States, where the 
bulk of his prolific output has until now been available only through the import 
bins. He is widely considered an avant-garde mainstay as well as a founding 
father of the new-age space music genre.
