,godich,2007-01-28T15:10Z,"I can help to seed this, but can't we put up a torrent with the episodes un-compressed so that I could use them while I seed? sounds like an idea?...=)"

,sku_dave,2007-08-03T09:41Z,"Thank you so much. I also think it would be wise to repack this so people can watch as it's downloading, so don't be surprised if you see another torrent floating around..."
