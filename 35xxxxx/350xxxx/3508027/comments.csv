If it's an official bootleg of theirs, you can freely distribute it once they stop selling it, like the '00-'05 bootlegs, and maybe some more.  And since this is an unauthorized bootleg, the label that put it out really has no legal leg to stand on if it is pirated, because they didn't legally distribute it in the first place.  By the way one of the larger Pearl Jam fansites called gremmie.net has a very large collection of these unauthorized bootlegs available to download for free as well."
