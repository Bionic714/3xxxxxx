,duck0,2006-09-15T19:05Z,"Note: These songs seem to be radio rips, faded to remove some of the  stream commercials, a few even recoded from really poor quality...

Just so much wasted bandwidth."

i'm pissed cuz there's pretty much nothing good on there but the paul van dyk tracks"
,Rompastompa,2008-01-09T16:10Z,"The remixes of the Police, Depeche Mode and Coldplay as well as artists like Prydz and Tiesto etc.  isn't it more club music? I mean I know Club is called Trance nowadays (sadly) but what are the rest of the tracks like? Are they typical commercial club? Not dissing, just asking.."
,TLG_killer,2008-01-19T20:41Z,sorry to do you mad but the first real trance appeared in 2004 ;P
,lol911,2008-02-16T11:12Z,"@MHN: This is NOT chillout. This compilation has like maybe 2-3 chillout songs, the rest are TRANCE!"
