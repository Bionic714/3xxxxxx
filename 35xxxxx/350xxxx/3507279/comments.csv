,yerk55,2010-05-30T01:02Z,"Thank you! I will seed this forever. Its not fair that the book goes for $100+ since its been discontinued (Ive seen some going for $900+ on ebay before!). Thanks for allowing us a chance to see it, for a considerable discount.

I would be happy to pay money for this so Valve and the books creators were compensated, but since it's out of production this isnt possible. I'll just be sure to continue paying for Valves amazing games, and you should too!"
