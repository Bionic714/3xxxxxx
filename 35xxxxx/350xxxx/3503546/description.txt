PLAYGIRL magazine, September 1973 

Complete Issue--except that the centerfold is missing (sorry, it probably dissappeared about 33 years ago, ask your mom if she knows anything about it). -You're likely not missing much, the magazine seemed to be pretty coy about displaying the cucumbers. 

All the regular columns, all the articles, and all the advertisements--Ellie May selling facial cream. A book titled "How To Get The Man You Want!". Music clubs selling 8-track tapes. Plus all the usual women's mag fluff--see haw far women's lib has come in thirty years. Or not, perhaps.
