Frankly, the images look better than the scenery. There is a clear cut line of change where this scenery takes over & the FS2004 default stops...like the IndyLite scenery there is a lot of green n this 1. I just didn't see that it was as well defined as the images show it to be.

I have hte feeling that the images were done with a 19.2 mesh from FSprojects. I tried to install an old FSGenesis mesh that I had but it didn't work too well....it was a file I had forever & may have actually been made for FS2002.

I was disappointed , but then with all the installing & uninstalling of stuff it may just be time for a format & reinstall of FS2004.

Please post your thoughts.
