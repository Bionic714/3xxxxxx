,MrEarp,2006-07-22T18:28Z,90% of all the Movietorrents on Piratebay seems to be with NONE Scandinavian subtitle and that's just great on a Scandinavian based site. 
,Metonomy,2006-07-22T18:55Z,"MrEarp: I wouldn't call The Pirate Bay a scandinavian based tracker. The Pirate Bay has always been there for everyone. It began in Mexico, planted it's roots in Sweden, and now after the bust, has moved abroad again. And, usually You will be able to find subs in the language You are interested in after some digging around, and I'm sure this movie is no exception to that."
,ursule,2006-07-22T20:14Z,"Well I'm not going to download this movie but I'm surely not complaining about its presence here, it doesn't take away any space that could have been used by other movies, does it?
It's just something ""more"", if you don't like it just ignore it, why complain?"
,Papegoja99,2006-07-22T22:07Z,"Okey if the original doesn´t have all subs. But someones gotta stop these ENG-SPA rips!

Don´t keep two languages!!! It ruins the picture quality for no need! Just keep the english and get done with it! No use to waste MB on a second language!

And I don´t care that there is a lot of spanish talking people out there. If the movie is recorded in english. Then just keep the english! 

Dubbing is for stupid people! It´s just a sign that you are to stupid to understand english, and even more stupid becouse you can´t understand you own spoken subs. So you need it dubbed."
,sputnikk666,2006-07-23T01:00Z,"Papegoja99: Personally I don't care so much about 2-4% better or worse image quality, the important thing is that the movie is here and we can download it today. The torrent-creator decided what to put in or out and I'm fine with whatever decision he/she made, as long as the original language is there and all the subs are there.
Keeping dubbed languages in the torrent gives a much broader audience and the torrent will live longer, that is what matters."
,sputnikk666,2006-07-23T18:26Z,"darth_tater: You see, not every dvd movie have Nordic subtitles. And if there would be _only_ movies with nordic subtitles on the pirate bay there would not be that many movies. So just relax and don't complain."
,MrEarp,2006-07-23T18:43Z,The spanish spoken people have there spanish torrentsite www.dvdquorum.es and WHY take a torrent from that site and put it here also? 
,sputnikk666,2006-07-24T14:03Z,"MrEarp: Becase they are good movies, and if they are posted here more poeple will be able to watch the movie. The Pirate Bay is a much bigger site."
,oobaka,2006-10-08T15:57Z,Is this NTSC or PAL?
,mac2007,2007-03-20T05:53Z,"It's probably PAL, because THE NAKED GUN 2 is PAL and shared by the same tonimacarronis. Thnk you, tonimacarronis.
... but why isn't these ""Naked Gun"" more popular ? Strange, isn't it ? Only a few seeders...
... hey, and must be said: SEED, those who want to seed something. The speed here is really slow.
Thanks."
,mac2007,2007-03-20T05:57Z,"me again... I meant ""a few leechers""... help us and seed..."
,katak1,2009-10-19T14:29Z,can someone pls seed?  im stuck at 99.7% and so will others as i do see lots of folks downloading from me on watever that i have.
,simonlevy1,2011-08-01T04:35Z,would somebody have the kindness to seed this torrent?
