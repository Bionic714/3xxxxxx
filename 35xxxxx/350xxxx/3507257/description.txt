  In CivCity: Rome, gamers will recreate the glory of Rome by building a 
  small settlement into a mighty imperial city. Featuring hundreds of 
  buildings including gladiatorial schools, amphitheatres, the circus 
  maximus, legionnaire forts, weapons workshops and much more, CivCity: Rome
  offers the most detailed look at Roman life ever depicted on a computer 
  screen. 
  

  Features:
  ~~~~~~~~~
  * Look inside the buildings - For the first time in a city builder you can
    look inside the Villas, the forums, and even the Roman baths! Discover, 
    in much greater detail, how Romans went about their daily lives. 
  * Civilize your city - More than 70 technologies can be developed over time
    to give your city a strategic advantage. Use the rich research tree to 
    improve many aspects of your city and its relation to the wider empire. 
  * Follow the life of a Roman family - Do they thrive and prosper from
    humble hut to noble palace as they move through the generations? or not?
    Well, that's your call! 
  * Ease of play - Driven purely by building placement and strong visual
    feedback, the game lets you create your own living community simply by 
    choosing and placing the wide variety of buildings. 
  * Real Romans - An intriguing array of characters will interact with you
    and bring high drama to your city with their emotions, state of health,
    and candid feelings about the city. There will even be famous Romans in
    the city who will comment on and present new challenges for you.
