,Dlaffy,2006-07-29T20:54Z,"Ive got it installed but evey time i try to run it it says please insert original CD/DVD, please help"
,OneRabidMonk,2006-07-29T21:28Z,I really want to play this!  Halfway through the setup it asks for cab3.  I have no idea where this is.  I unrarred disc 2 but there is only a cue file and no bin. I am using daemon tools.
,runnin910,2006-07-30T01:44Z,I do not see the crack directory in CD2. Is anyone else having that problem?
,Dlaffy,2006-07-30T03:20Z,Same problem here
,ZafrullaH,2006-07-30T09:45Z,when youve mounted cd2 then rightclick explore on it and you will then see the crack directory
,Tiox,2006-07-30T16:14Z,Awesome Game!! Thanks!
,Johenz,2006-07-30T17:10Z,"när jag ska unrara CD1 så står det ""rld-ccra.bin.r17:CRC failed in rld-ccra.bin. The file is corrupt"".
Hur ska ja göra?"
,ergot,2006-07-30T19:18Z,"Works great--thanks!  Fast download, too.  The crack is in the ""crack"" directory is on CD2, if you really can't find it it is also on Megagames.  I used WinRAR to unpack and Vitrual Clone Drive to install."
,Dlaffy,2006-07-30T20:58Z,Ive found the crack but whats the Instillation Directory?
,Vismaior,2006-07-30T23:31Z,Are you guys getting an error message every new mission and the game quits?
[T],sotis,2006-07-31T04:25Z,@ bobfree123: Please stop spamming!
,Derivator,2006-07-31T11:16Z,"What is ""the addon"" referred to in the reloaded intstructions. My game keeps crashing, perhaps I missed this addon?"
,Vismaior,2006-07-31T12:35Z,"Exactly, I'm having the same problem as Derivator. I have no clue what is this addon that RELOADED file talks about."
,Vismaior,2006-08-01T12:42Z,anyone? or are we the only two people with this problem ?
,Derivator,2006-08-02T12:26Z,I think it could be the gameshadow program. I did not install it the first time and now I can't uninstall the game properly. 
,Vismaior,2006-08-03T21:24Z,that would be starnge if it was because of the gameshadow. Did you try it with it ?

,BattleHymn,2006-08-07T22:01Z,"Mine works just fine. nothing wrong on the crack... But, i forgot to install the addon...maybe thats why mine is working ok?!?!?"
,Roosen.se,2006-08-10T16:55Z,I didnt install the addon and it worked anyway. No prob to find the crack ether.

,Homsar22,2007-01-02T05:33Z,"The game works great. The only thing I would have done different would be to put up just the .bin and .cue files instead of a bunch of compressed files=less HD space & less work to install it. Not trying to criticize, THANK YOU for putting it up :)--just saying it would be easier.


The crack works fine with the game, but if you want to put the patch up you need to go to http://www.gamecopyworld.com to get a crack that works with the patch (1.1)."

the game is boring and sucks and runs like shit

i'm on a brand new 2.4ghz quad core and it runs like trash....and the game play is boring.

caesar iv may be the way to go...."
,Sergiodx,2008-01-08T17:40Z,"The game is working fine. It is pretty like Caesar IV, but it runs better here than Caesar does. If someone cas send me those files, I woud apreciate that. Thanks."

,wowdoggy,2008-09-25T08:31Z,"Scanned with NAV, KAV, & Avast (crystal clean copy); found update at FilePlanet & crack at GameBurnWorld.  Although very similar, apart from the water, Caesar IV ain't got nothin' on this game!  Thanks for the upload!  Regards, wowdoggy."
,wowdoggy,2008-09-25T09:02Z,"HOW TO INSTALL (YOU SHOULD ALWAYS SCAN FOR VIRUSES BEFORE EVER INSTALLING ANYTHING)
Right-click  daemon tools icon; set # of devices to 2.
Mount disk1 in first drive and disk2 in second.
Create 2 new folders somewhere and copy and paste the files from each disk into each folder and then scan them BEFORE INSTALLING.  Once you know they are clean, trash them.
Run setup.exe and when it asks for the second disk, make sure you type the proper drive letter in the path sequence (it won't be the same as what is printed there).
Let it finish installing.
Go to FilePlanet and get update 1.0 to 1.1 and install.
Go to GameBurnWorld and get no-cd fix 1.1.
Go to where the game is in program files and paste new CivCity Rome.exe into folder (I always rename the original one as originalCivCity Rome.exe before I copy & paste in case I ever need the original .exe).
Unmount drives from Daemon and the game should work.
Regards, wowdoggy."

,madpraxis,2012-09-04T07:38Z,"Man, people are stupid. Seriously, if you can't even be bothered to go look up how to burn a dvd before bitching about your inability to burn a dvd, all you do is make yourself look like a tool.
And I will say:
Thank You.
I had a burning urge to play this game yet my laptops dvd player is broken, thus the dvd in my hand does me jack all good, so thank you for letting me get my rome crack."
