,dMike,2006-07-17T11:00Z,"To all those who downloaded this great movie, I hope you found the encoding sound and the quality acceptable.

This is my first torrent and I'm trying hard to get everything right. In addition to the sample included with the torrent, you can find audio and still image samples at this URL:

If you haven't yet, I hope you'll download and enjoy the flick then help me to seed it so others can enjoy it as well.

Thanks,
dMike"
,Mr.Miyagiz,2006-07-17T15:06Z,Thanks! Nice Work!!
,cyber_system_tk,2006-07-17T18:00Z,This is not a good Movie
,SweetNucca,2006-07-17T22:54Z,"I very much appreciate the upload and the quality of the encode. Good job and thank you !! 

That said, this movie is a total piece of shit. How in the fuck do these horrible scripts get made into movies ?? Someone should be shot in the face for allowing this abomination to be produced."
,cyber_system_tk,2006-07-17T23:04Z,SweetNucca is right this movie sucks and the worst is that there will come a Superman Returns 2
,SweetNucca,2006-07-18T20:37Z,"I would like to add that anyone that thinks this is a ""good"" movie has either got serious mental illness or is just too ignorant to know any better."
,borgruler,2006-07-19T09:52Z,"great upload 1st m8
but damn this should have stayed on the drawing board, 1st we were shafted with xmen 3 now this pile of shit turns up when will they learn we want good scripts as well as great effects tossers,,, RANT OVER lol"
,DjTrizz,2006-07-20T02:46Z,"judging by your last comment, ignorance must be bliss Nucca.  I'll wait till I get the whole movie before passing judgement, I've seen the first half, it reminded me too much of the old Superman movies"
,DjTrizz,2006-07-20T07:59Z,"hmm...few things bothered me, Lois getting ragdolled in that airplane and coming out okay...yet a door hits her in the head and she's knocked the hell out...too many dark scenes.  Other than that...it was a good movie."
,SweetNucca,2006-07-20T19:30Z,"If you thought that Superman Returns was a ""good"" movie than you must either be a young, brainless, television raised teen or amazingly stupid. How can anyone possibly call that piece of trash a ""good"" movie ??? And, FYI, the second half is even worse... The whole lame-assed premise of him leaving Earth starts the movie off in the toilet, where can it possibly go from there ?"
,DjTrizz,2006-07-20T19:49Z,probably one of those over zealous comic book nerds ain't ya?
,DjTrizz,2006-07-20T20:04Z,"damn database error...not typing all that shit again...if you want a actual shit movie, that's Scary Movie 4.  I will admit there was too much story in this movie and not enough action.  Then again, this is his 'Return' so I can understand that.  I can understand that are people out there who just don't like the whole Superman character concept and in turn just don't care for the movies.  Then there are the super comic nerds that will nit pick at every last thing because it's not how they want it and fail to realize it's a movie based off comics and not a actual comic series"
,SweetNucca,2006-07-21T05:31Z,"Doesn't take a comic fan to recognize that this movie is really a piece of shit. If you think it is a good movie then you must be the nerdy comicbook geek, or maybe a fan of the gay director. :D You probably thought those shit X-Men movies were good too..."
,SweetNucca,2006-07-21T22:16Z,You would see better movies if you did take my advice... :D :D Maybe you and DJtrizz will get lucky and they will make a Boo-Bah or Teletubbies movie that you both can enjoy. :)
,Souls,2006-07-22T19:53Z,"Well fuck you, I liked it.

Take it for what it's worth. It's a good movie with accurately portrayed characters (yes, that means Brandon Routh) and an interesting story."
,SweetNucca,2006-07-24T21:14Z,"""Interesting story""...  Lol @ Corky.
You need help, seriously. :D :D

But, thanks for the laugh."
,Souls,2006-07-24T23:13Z,"By the way, I'd just like to congratulate you on the quality of the file. An excellent torrent, especially for your first one. Keep up the good work! :)"
,Souls,2006-07-24T23:15Z,"Yeah... I must need help. I mean, after all, how can any opinion that differs from yours be valid?"
,SweetNucca,2006-07-25T17:28Z,"Well, brother, if you found that story to be ""interesting"" then you can consider yourself to be a member of the group known as ""the lowest common denominator"". 

Your government is very happy to have citizens like you.  :D :D"

boredom ftw!"
,Nrk_111,2006-09-14T19:10Z,"This Movie isn´t good quality... It has been
