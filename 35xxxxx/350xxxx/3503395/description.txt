Superman Returns (2006) maVen Telesync (DivX by dMike)

This trans-encode was made directly from the 2 CD maVen xVid carefully rejoined and half sized to fit on a single CD. It matches the KvCD in quality but can be played directly from the computer. It scales well to full-screen and, while far from perfect, is quite watchable on a 27 inch TV. Since the original source material is CAM, both the picture and sound are lower in quality than a DVD rip. If you have questions about the encode, check the included SupRet2006-Sample-DivX.avi which includes both low-light and high action sequences for your evaluation.
