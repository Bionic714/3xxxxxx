[T],WinstonSmith6079,2006-08-31T11:15Z,"No prob.  Try Serious Sam: The First Encounter if you don't have it already.  It's even better than this one, and it's also been submitted to this site."
,@ngel,2006-09-04T13:09Z,"Hey winston

Can't get it to work
How do i launch it from the BIN files?
"
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2006-09-04T14:27Z,Better to launch it from the .CUE files rather.  Use a prg like Alcohol 120% or Nero.
,@ngel,2006-09-05T08:40Z,Winston i've left you 2 notes... still got problems
,ryujijitei,2006-09-15T00:22Z,So...how exactly do I use this?
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2006-09-16T18:02Z,"If using Alcohol 120%, you can drag & drop the .CUE file onto Alcohol's window.  Then select Image Burning Wizard to burn the game to a CD.  Then install from that CD.

If you don't want to use a CD, Alcohol 120% will create a virtual DVD (& CD) drive.  Right-click on the virtual drive, such as in My Computer, select Mount Image > Open... and then browse for the .CUE file you want, in this case 'SeriousSam 2nd.cue'.  You just put the CD image (a virtual CD) into the vitrual drive.  Install the game, patch from the URL given in the description above, then play.

At least several copies of Alcohol 120% can be found on this site, if you don't have it already."

,Thorian,2007-06-01T12:41Z,"I have the file, mounted the .cue file using alcohol soft and have installed the game, but i cant get it to run, it just asks for the CD. I have burned a disc, mounted an image and even downloaded another SS-SE iso. All of which give the same response, what am I missing here?"
,Thorian,2007-06-01T20:08Z,"Ahh, I downloaded the UK patch, this is the US version of the game. That would explain it."
,lol12,2007-08-05T21:14Z,Seed plz! 
,lol12,2007-08-05T21:17Z,And also will Daemon Tools be able to run this? Or do I have to use Alcohol 120%?
,masterfnogg,2007-09-26T11:19Z,"lol12: Both Deamon Tools and Alcohol 120% will work.

WinstonSmith6079: Thx for this great game. Both this and the first encounter."

,Rawulf12,2008-07-14T18:35Z,"hey winston, i know you've already said how to do it but i still don't understand....i opened the BIN file with Magic Iso (probably not the best) and i extracted everything, installed it, patched it and it keeps asking for cd!!! tell me what to do please.....i used to play this game when i was little and never got to finish it"
,sniper_zero,2008-07-20T14:16Z,"@Rawulf12, use Daemon Tools, seriously."

,munkypotamus,2008-08-28T09:06Z,"i have a copy of this game that i bought a long time ago, great stuff, just downloading this so i have an easy image on my HD (original CD is buried and probably scratched lol).  

PLanning to play through this again (getting as many secrets as possible, and trying to resist shooting my miniature self at the pyramid studio), then rip one of the songs out of the game for use in a school project. hah."
,caniverous_toilet,2008-09-27T17:42Z,"Great upload. I've been wanting this game for a while now, yet never got round to buying it. You solved my problem, thanks :]"

Thank you winston
"
,Arkainos,2009-01-18T17:20Z,WTF!?!? Sam is always looking up!!! The game works perfectly but Sam is always looking at the sky
,MrInferno,2009-02-01T06:02Z,"Promiser you need to download daemon tools.


Just type it in on google. Then click the first one and select download.

It makes it so your computer thinks you have the disk in but you dont actually need it. Just read the description on daemon tools."
,Miganiya,2009-02-19T13:22Z,"I had trouble with my screen chopping on 8600GT and 2.2 gHz Intel, and this is how I solved it:

there is an application (game) launcher called win2k Launcher, which, I'm not sure how, virtually lowers the speed of your processor, if it is too strong. (I didn't even know that could happen) Through this launcher, your processor can be separated into 8 different sections, so you only mark one of them, launch the game via this little thingy, and you're all set. I forgot where I got the program, but it offers me a link to www.gameroffice.com, so it is likely to be found there.

I also used this launcher for Unreal Tournament 2000

Hope this helped..."
,Miganiya,2009-02-19T13:23Z,"Yeah, and Winston - thanx mate :)"
,Tidral,2009-03-17T13:16Z,"My laptop has no problem running these kinds of games.

It just pisses me off that some games dont come with the crack so I have to find it myself.! D:"
,Tidral,2009-03-17T13:16Z,"Oh and, you should try using ULTRAIso. I think its a lot better than Daemon."
,norwegian13,2009-03-27T16:57Z,Thank you SO MUCH for posting this:) And thanks to you seeders for seeding:)
