,knaak,2006-09-13T16:25Z,"this piece of shit dosent work.. thanks for making me spend 13 gb on something that dosent work. The sound keeps dropping out and the video playback is laggy. I donÂ´t have these problems with other hdtv stuff so it has to be the file.

DonÂ´t waste your time and bandwidth on this!"

just because other hd-movies has worked doesnt mean that this will. your computer probably suck to much to be able to show it properly."

,STARATOM,2008-09-17T23:49Z,"Oh Mr HDTV CHINA, when will you realise that lots of people would like to download your films, i being one of them.
But you give no clear instructions, tips etc; on what hardware and software one should have.
What i think you should do is upload a torrent that people can download, that gives clear instructions on what hardware and software one should have to playback your HDTV uploads.
If you would take the time to do this then, trust me, people downloading your films would increase a hundred fold.
I urge you to please upload a torrent, that contains detailed instructions, even if it is in the form of a notepad, this would be enough.  "
