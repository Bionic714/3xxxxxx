,ems2g,2006-08-25T20:49Z,This album is amazing! The Roots are the essence of hip-hop and if you like this album PLEASE BUY IT ON THE 29TH to show your support! Not to mention the audio production is so amazing on this album you'll be guaranteed hear things on the real cd that are lost to mp3 compression!
