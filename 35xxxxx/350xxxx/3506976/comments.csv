It doesn't work, nor the CD version from Popart, I'm using the downloaded version;-)"
[T],stevekasian,2006-07-25T11:40Z,Only prob was the original CD version din't work. There was never a patch included to allow it to be run on a virtual drive. Oh well...

Thanks for the upload"
,WinnieXL,2006-07-31T20:31Z,As in the read me file included by Popart: Keep image file mounted when you install service pack 1.
