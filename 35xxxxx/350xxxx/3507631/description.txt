This off-shoot of McGuinness Flint, rechristened momentarily in the wake of the departure of songwriting members Benny Gallagher and Graham Lyle, left behind one major cult item, Lo and Behold, the best album of Dylan covers ever done by anyone. McGuinness Flint themselves played blues-based roots rock, close in spirit to but less jazz-inspired than the group from which Tom McGuinness had come, Manfred Mann; drummer Hughie Flint was an alumnus of the lineup of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers that everyone heard, featuring Eric Clapton. Dennis Coulson fronted the group vocally, and Dixie Dean joined up on bass after Gallagher and Lyle's departure. They later became known simply as McGuinness-Flint (Mark 2). ~ Bruce Eder, All Music Guide
