,Mr_Ecks,2006-07-06T19:37Z,The movie sucked and the speach reeked. I laughed so hard I almost choked. You are ironic aren't You? Even a stupid assed american can't be that moronically nationalistic.
,Temptation,2006-07-07T12:34Z,"I guess Americans decided to take Independence Day as a blueprint for how to act.. cause they sure have tried their best to mimic in real life and foreign policy the same kind of stupid, loud, obnoxious, ""blow the shit out of everything and everyone"", obscenely nationalistic and self-centred yankee jingoism and ""patriotism"" shit that they saw in this horribly stupid American movie.

,Temptation,2006-07-07T16:28Z,"No, I doubt very much this upload is a joke.  Americans really are this stupidly nationalistic.  Even now, after they have illegally invaded a country that was never a threat to them, all for that sweet, sweet oil to power their fucking gas-guzzling SUVs, and have murdered anywhere from 45000 to 100000 Iraqis, and left a country and society devasted and destroyed, not to mention tortured and raped innocent Iraqi civilians, if you watch American media these fuckers are still waving around the flag and screeching ""God Bless America"" and ""support our troops"".  They just don't get it.  These bastards should be on trial for war crimes, but instead, if you watch these American sons of bitches and politicians on the US media, you would thing Iraq attacked America on 9/11 and they have every right to go and bomb any country they want.  So with that kind of mentality, I'm sure the uploader is dead serious about when he describes this stupid speech as ""great"".  After all, is this speech that much different from the stupid, cartoonish speeches that George W. Bush gives?  It's scary how similar they sound.  "

,will24,2007-11-24T04:53Z,"I take it you stupid fuckers aren't from America. You're probably fucking doushe bag Brits. ""Oh, look at me! I'm Brittish! I'm better than you! Cherrio!"""
