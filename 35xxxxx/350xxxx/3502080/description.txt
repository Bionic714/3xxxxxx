
JKP Joe Kane Productions DVE Digital Video Essentials - Double-Layer DVD ISO Image - 7gb

"Calibration" video/audio testing disk for higher-end home video home-theater setups

This is one of those DVDs that "compressing" or converting to DIVX is counter-productive.  Original reproduction is key to having accurate test patterns, etc.

DVD Rip of Digital Video Essentials, originally acquired via eMule. Time-stamps on files indicate originally ripped about 8/2003.

Believed to be NTSC version.  Plays on my NTSC DVD player, and on PC DVD drives.

I could not find a complete torrent online, so downloaded the eMule (painful!) 7 parts RAR, extracted originally to an AUDIO_TS & VIDEO_TS directories.

Converted from AUDIO_TS & VIDEO_TS into a more burnable ISO image (using IMGTool)
 
Did a test burn using IMGBurn of the ISO to a Verbatim DVD+R DL 2.4x Double-Layer Disc, (too big for a single layer disk!)

Tested on home DVD Player and PC DVD drive, works...

then created this torrent of the final ISO image for other interested.  If you are interested, please download and re-seed for others.    There are/where several folks getting only partial downloads from the older torrents....
