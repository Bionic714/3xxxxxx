,cmattpb,2006-07-21T01:44Z,No comments?  Numerous downloads -- does it work for others?
,cmattpb,2006-07-21T01:45Z,"No comments?  Numerous successful downloads -- few seeders...   

At least let others know if it works?  But PLEASE seed ...."
,sonicHeart,2006-07-28T08:02Z,"More seeders please!!!  Once I get the whole file I can seed for a couple of weeks!   

This is a great torrent and shouldn't be shelved!

SEED!"
,more2,2006-08-13T23:26Z,Seeding.  so far no luck burning to a double layer DVD. Sonic my DVD studio is still hanging after about an hour.
,more2,2006-08-14T00:44Z,Error writing to disk. I now have a $3.00 coaster (those double layer DVD aren't cheap).  I can play the .iso file on my computer with VLC media player (highly recommended player btw).  Any ideas?
,cmattpb,2006-08-27T22:57Z,"IMGBURN works just fine.   Version 1.3.0.0 was used here -- that same disc has been used several times so far.   And several discs made from this ISO.   Haven't tested with the new IMGBURN 2.0.0.0 -- would apprecaite any input on whether 1.3 vs 2.0 have any differences, or whether any other methods have worked or failed...    "

,digger44,2007-08-30T02:40Z,oh...for anyone else that tries imgBurn_2.3.2.0 it wants DVDDecrypter installed also
,ICDP,2009-01-03T19:11Z,"Please keep in mind when (video) calibrating your TV's you will need special filters or gels otherwise you can really screw up or burn out your tv's.You can get the Red Blue and Green filters (gels) from 'high-end'camera stores or directly from the Avia website.You cannot use any old kind of filters,,,you will need special filters that can be costly at a high-end Camera store.The filter (gels) Specs are as follows:  From Kodak

Deep Red Tricolor #29
Deep Green Tricolor #61 
Deep Blue Tricolor #47B

or

The correct Lee Filters are:
Tokyo Blue = #071
Primary Red = #106
Primary Green = #139
{NOTE: Lee?s Tokyo Blue is their equivalent to the Kodak #47B, Deep Blue Tricolor.

Once you have these filters you can then properly calibrate your CRT and the new DLP,HDTV, plasma and LCD video systems.There are many other factors to keep in mind but this will give you the best possible quality from your video system before you have to call a professional Technician.( $$$$$ )"
