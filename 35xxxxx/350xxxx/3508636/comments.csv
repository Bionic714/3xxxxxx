,OttifantSir,2008-10-06T21:29Z,"To KarkkiZERG:

Everyone says to get VLC because it is free as in free beer (no cost) and as in free speech (don't like it? change it!), and it is available for all OSes out there. Besides, it updates regularly. Last update was to version 0.9.2 this month, while MPC haven't been updated (except for a translation to Czech) since 2006.

I have found ONE, and ONLY ONE format VLC can't play: RealMedia. WMP, Quicktime, RealPlayer, MPC, Totem, Gxine, MPlayer, you name it, VLC have them beat hands down each and every time. It can't play DRMed movies of any format either, but you can't play DRM-WMV in MPC, RealPlayer or Quicktime either. Or any other way you wanna try. It has to be the native player only.

NOW do you understand why people always say get VLC?"
,G_Blackwood,2008-10-24T05:07Z,I need to see this. I'm told the game's based on the movie. But hell.
,TorrentMonster,2009-10-17T21:01Z,"DUDE!!! i cant belive they are making a game of this movie, and my favorite actor is Christian Slater, FUCKING SWEET! 8D"
