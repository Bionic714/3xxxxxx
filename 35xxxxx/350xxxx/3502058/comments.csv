,Black_Rage,2007-08-13T13:24Z,"Sorry but that's a good acting job, had a buddy who worked for the county coroner, he used to tell me about the incoming d.o.a.'s, face didn't turn blue, no loss of bowel or bladder control, happens right after death, no tongue sticking out(gag reflex) eyes focused, sure sign of life(eyes typically roll back or cross) but a good acting job in any event ;)"
,aeg831,2007-10-12T20:48Z,"Actually, your friend in the coroner's office is full of shit.  Found my neighbor hanging dead from a tree in his back yard:  His face was quite purple.  You see, hanging causes death by one of two possible mechanisms:  Asphyxiation by constriction of the trachea & carotids, or if violent enough, through the severing of the spinal chord.  If death is caused by asphyxiation, the face invariably turns puple.  If death is by spinal cord injury, the face does not turn purple. "
